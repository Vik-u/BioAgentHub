Horseradish peroxidase \n(HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgGs was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, \nPA, USA). All other reagents were from MilliporeSigma (Burlington, MA, USA) \nEnzyme purification \ncDNA sequence of P ETase was derived from Ideonella sakaiensis isolate amino acid sequence (3) with \nmodifications described (12). Flag-tag and 9xHistidine tag were added at the C- terminus of the PETase. \nSynthetic constructs were manufactured by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA)  and inserted into the pET-\n21b(+) vector (Novogene, Boston, MA, USA) at NdeI and Xho I sites to generate pET-21b-PETase-SW \nexpression plasmid.  \nProtein expression was conducted in E.coli  BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Agilent Technologies , San \nDiego, CA, USA). Induced cultures were grown at 18\u00b0C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation \n(5,000g for 20 min), and pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of purification buffer (Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, \n500 m M NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitors ). Cell suspensions were incubated with 5 mg/ml \nlysozyme on ice for 30 min and disrupted by sonication. Proteins were purified using Protino NTA columns \n(Macherey-Nagel, Freemansburg, PA, USA ) using linear imidazole gradients (30- 250 mM ). Protein \nidentity was confirmed by immunoblotting. Protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Protein \nAssays. Purified proteins were concentrated by dialysis in storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, \n500 mM NaCl supplemented with 50% glycerol). Aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C. \nPETase activity assay \nPETase activity was measured  in 96 wells plates for 20 min by optical absorption at 400 nm using \nSpectraFluor Plus microplate reader (Tecan US, Morrisville, NC, USA). Reactions were conducted in 200 \n\u03bcl of the reaction buffer (20 mM Tris -HCl, 100 mM NaCl , 0.005% Brij 35) supplemented with 100 nM \nPETase. To initiate the chromogenic reaction, 100 \u03bcM p- NPA was added to each well . All enzymatic \nactivities were measured at 24\u00b0C and pH 8.0 unless indicated overwise. Optimization parameters included \npH (4.0-9.0), temperature (24-50\u00b0C), glycerol (0\u201325%), NaCl (0.1\u20135M), SDS (0\u20134%) and DMSO (0-100%) \nthat were tested in respective increments as indicated on Fig . 1.

To control the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of p-NPA, parallel reactions for \neach optimization parameter were conducted without PETase. \nStatistical and kinetics analysis \nA t wo-tailed unpaired t -test with Welch 's correlations parametric test was used to compare enzyme \nactivities between test groups.

P roduction runs were performed using NPT ensemble s (p=1 atm , T=300K, 0.5 \u00b5sec \ntimescale). FF14SB (22) and GAFF force field parameters (23) were applied to the protein and substrate \nmodel, respectively. Atomic charges were determined using the RESP model (24) . Simulations were \nperformed with ion numbers corresponding to low and high salt concentrations (4M NaCl solution). 3D \nmodels were visualized in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.2 Schr\u00f6dinger, \nLLC). \nResults and discussion \nHigh salt concentration leverages the enzymatic activity of PETase \nChromogenic assays using p -NPA as a substrate were conducted to explore the effect of environmental \nconditions on PETase enzymatic activity. To optimize the reaction conditions, reactions were supplemented \nwith the following chemical additives: NaCl (0.1-5M), glycerol (0\u201325.0%), SDS (0-4.0%), and DMSO (0-\n100%).  \nStrikingly, a dramatic increase of the PETase enzymatic activity at NaCl concentrations from 500 mM to 5 \nM was observed (Fig. 1 A-F). The highest specific activity (3.8-fold increase) was measured at 5M NaCl. \nHigh activities were observed in seawater ( salinity of ~35 parts per thousand (ppt), 0.47 M NaCl ). In \naddition, increased activities in the presence of SDS <0.5% and 5% (v/v) glycerol were detected. SDS \n(above 3%) and DMSO negatively affected the activity.  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of significantly leveraged PETase activity in the presence \nof NaCl concentrations above 500 mM and up to 5 M . Published studies of the PETase activity were \nconducted at NaCl concentrations typically ranging from 0 to 150 mM (3, 11, 12, 16, 17, 25) . To explain \nthe effect of high salt concentration, a predictive analysis of conformational dynamics of PETase bound to \na substrate was conducted.  \nPETase/polymer complex exhibits distinct conformations at low and high salt in MDS modeling \nMDS w as applied to understand the parameters of PETase/substrate interactions at low and high  salt \nconcentrations. A theoretical 3-unit PET polymer model represented a hydrolytic substrate. Published 3D \ncrystal structures of the recombinant I. sakaiensis PETase (a 2.02A resolution structure (PDB:6ANE) (11) \nand a 1.58A resolution structure of the  R103G/S131A mutant PETase complex with (2-hydroxyethyl) 4-\nmethyl terephthalate (HEMT) (PDB:5XH3) (17)) were used to build dynamic models . Covalently bound \nHEMT was substituted with a 3-unit PET polymer (Fig. 2A-C). The central unit of a 3-unit substrate was \nreoriented to match the position s of HEMT  within the PETase catalytic center. MDS predicted the \nenzyme/substrate conformation states at 150 mM (low) to 4M (high) NaCl concentrations, and 0 ns to 500 \nns timepoints. \nAccording to MDS, salt mediated dramatic conformational changes in the polymer-bound PETase \ncatalytic center by altering the orientation of the polymer's ester bonds relative to the catalytic residues (Fig. \n2B-C). At low salt concentrations, the positions of units 1 and 2 and PETase catalytic residues at 500 ns \nsimulation timepoint matched the initial geometry, and unit 1 and 3 attained bent conformations. In contrast, \nhigh NaCl concentrations mediated conformational changes  in D206SIAPVNSS214 and \nI232NGGSH237FCANSGN244 catalytic loops and the polymer units relative to the catalytic residues.
