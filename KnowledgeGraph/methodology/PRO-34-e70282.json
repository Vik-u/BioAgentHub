    "protein engineering assisted by molecular dynamics\nanalysis, resulting in the creation of LCC-A2, which\ncontains two mutations compared to LCC-ICCG\n(H218Y and N248D). This enzyme has a Tm of\n95.25\n/C14 C and can degrade more than 90% of pretreated\npostconsumer PET in 3.3 h at 78/C14 C. LCC-A2 created\n1.4 times more degradation products than LCC-ICCG\nafter 10 h of incubation at 72/C14 C (Zheng et al.,2024). It\nhas been shown to exhibit the highest activity when\ncompared to 14 other thermophilic PETases under con-\nditions of 70\n/C14 C and pH 7.5 (Norton-Baker et al.,2024).\nThese engineering efforts enabled the industrial uti-\nlization of thermophilic enzymes. The company Car-\nbios, founded in 2011, utilizes a variant of the enzyme\nLCC-ICCG to depolymerize pre-treated PET. In 2023,\nCarbios had a recycling capacity of approximately\n250 kg of plastic daily (Buranyi,\n2023). While celebrat-\ning Carbios as the first company to apply enzymatic\ndegradation for PET recycling, there is still enormous\npotential for improvement in fully utilizing enzymatic\nPET degradation. For instance, challenges remain in\naddressing high-crystallinity PET in both mesophilic\nand thermophilic ranges (Thomsen, Almdal, &\nMeyer,\n2023), improving PET degradation efficiency in\nthe mesophilic range even with amorphous PET, and\nexploring the mineralization of PET through whole-cell\nbiocatalysts. These challenges can be tackled by vari-\nous strategies beyond improving the catalytic activity of\na single enzyme. These include employing bacterial\ncommunities (Gao & Sun,\n2021; Roberts et al.,2020),\nusing enzyme cocktails (Maity et al.,2021), and incor-\nporating adhesion molecules and binding proteins\n(Rennison et al., 2023). The integration of these\nstrategies\u2014 better explained in the next section\u2014 holds\nsignificant promise toward a sustainable and efficient\napproach to PET recycling, contributing to a more sus-\ntainable future.",
