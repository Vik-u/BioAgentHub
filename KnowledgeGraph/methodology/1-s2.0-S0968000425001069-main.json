    "experimental methods and simulation techniques while emphasizing the poten-\ntial for engineering more effective PET hydrolases. \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2025.05.002 707 \n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). \nDiscovery and potential of PET hydrolases \nThe existence of enzymes capable of degrading PET (see Glossary), a synthetic anthropogenic \npolyme\nr not found in nature, is remarkable. While enzymes have evolved to effectively target nat-\nural substrates, the presence of these enzymes that can degrade PET is surprising at \ufb01rst glance. \nHowever, upon closer examination, one \ufb01nds that there are hydrolysable synthetic polymers like \nPET that share structural similarities, such as ester bonds, with natural polyesters like cutin, which \nare substrates for hydrolases. Thermobi\ufb01da fusca cutinase (TfC) was the \ufb01rst PET-degrading en-\nzyme discovered, as described in 2005 [1]. \nSince then, a number of PET hydrolases have been identi\ufb01ed and advanced [2], including the \nlea\nf compost cutinase (LCC) and polyester hydrolase I (PES-H1, also known as PHL7) which \nwere both derived from compost metagenome libraries in 2014 [3] and 2022 [4], respectively. \nLCC \nshows high activity against PET and exhibits cutinase-like properties, enabling the enzyme \nto break down polymer structures effectively. Building on this natural enzyme, the French \ncompany CARBIOS utilized the ICCG variant of LCC (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G) [5], en-\nab\nling them to successfully launch the \ufb01rst enzymatic PET recycling demonstration plant in \n2021 with plans to open a larger facility with a recycling capacity of 130 tons per day in 2025 \n(https://www.carbios.com/en/enzymatic-recycling/ ). Although PES-H1 is somewhat less ac-\ntive \nthan LCC [6], it is of industrial interest, as well, as it demonstrates a broader substrate \nsp\neci\ufb01city that could be enhanced further through a two-enzyme system, similar to that em-\nployed by Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bacterium can effectively metabolize PET using \nthe enzymes IsPETase and MHETase, which facilitate the complete degradation of PET into \nbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), ulti-\nmately producing the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) [7]. \nTable 1 summarizes key wild-type (WT) and mutant PET hydrolases, detailing their enzymatic \ncharac\nteristics on both amorphous and crystalline PET substrates, along with the temperatures \nat which these parameters were measured. It highlights how enzyme performance varies with\nHighlights \nThe existence of polyethylene terephthal-\nate (PET) hydrolases is striking, given that \nPET is a synthetic polymer and enzymes \nevolved for natural substrates. \nTo enhance the applicability of PET hy-\ndrol\nases in industrial settings, targeted \nenzyme reengineering is essential. \nStrategies for improving PET hydrolases \ninclud\ne increasing thermostability, accel-\nerating catalytic reactions, and optimiz-\ning binding to PET substrates. \nAccording to the Sabatier principle, \nachiev\ning optimal binding strength be-\ntween PET and PET hydrolases is crucial \nfor effective catalysis. \nA range of biochemical and biophysical \ntechnique\ns is available to enhance our \nunderstanding of PET hydrolase adsorp-\ntion to PET, paving the way for advanced \nenzyme design.\ntemperature and PET substrate crystallinity, with higher temperatures generally improving activity. \nAdditionally, many values remain unestablished, underscoring the need for a more comprehen-\nsive understanding of enzymatic PET hydrolysis. To address this, Arnal et al. developed a stan-\ndardized protocol for larger-scale studies, applying it to four PET hydrolases [16]. Their \ufb01ndings \nide\nnti\ufb01ed that FAST-PETase and HotPETase are unsuitable for large-scale applications due to \nlow depolymerization rates, while PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y (PES-H1FY ) could be a promising candi-\ndate with 80% depolymerization upon further enzyme evolution. LCCICCG excelled, achieving \n98% PET conversion to TPA and EG in 24 h, and they improved its economic viability by reducing \nenzyme usage by a factor of 3 and lowering the reaction temperature from 72\u00b0C to 68\u00b0C. None-\ntheless, further optimization is crucial for enhancing the catalytic ef\ufb01ciency and environmental im-\npact of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, as current life cycle assessments show that enzymatic PET \nrecycling still lags behind virgin PET production in most categories [17]. Therefore, we will \ufb01rst ex-\namine the individual steps of the catalytic cycle, which present several opportunities for enzyme \nimprovement, before focusing on the initial step: the adsorption of PET hydrolases onto the \nPET material.\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences",
