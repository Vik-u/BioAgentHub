    "methodology involved embedding cutinase sequences as nodes in a network graph, where 485 \neach node was connected to its k nearest (Euclidean) neighbors, thereby enabling a direct 486 \ncomparison between two embedding schemes, OHE and LASE. While OHE provides a 487 \nstraightforward mutational distance metric between sequences, it often oversimplifies the 488 \nnuanced relationship between sequence variation and function. In contrast, LASE, by training 489 \na family-specific deep learning model on our dataset of ancestrally reconstructed sequences, 490 \ncaptures the functional properties of proteins in an abstract manner, revealing non -linear 491 \nsequence-activity relationships that are obscured in OHE representations. 492 \n 493 \nUsing LASE to map the sequence -fitness landscape, we highlighted iterative improvements 494 \nin PETase activity throughout the different phases of our sequence exploration of the cutinase 495 \nfamily.

Moreover, our analysis 498 \nof the fitness landscape's ruggedness via LASE provided new insights into the role of epistasis 499 \nin PETase activity. The local Dirichlet energy calculations revealed that sequences with the 500 \nhighest PETase activity were associated with the greatest ruggedness, suggesting that the 501 \nmost functionally optimized variants emerge from complex interplays of multiple mutations 502 \nrather than from linear accumulations of beneficial single mutations. This observation 503 \nhighlights the significance of epistatic interactions in driving the evolutionary innovation of 504 \nPETase activity, illustrating that successful enzyme variants often lie in regions of the fitness 505 \nlandscape that are not readily accessed through single mutational steps, but can be accessed 506 \nusing evolutionarily-guided approaches, such as mASR. 507 \n 508 \n  509 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Sequence redundancy was removed to 90% ID in CD -HIT53. Signal peptides 514 \nwere deleted using SignalP4.0 54. Alignment was performed using the GINSI protocol of 515 \nMAFFT55. 100 replicates of independent model parameterization and tree search (default 516 \nparameters) were performed using IQTREE2 56 on the NCI GADI supercomputer.

The cells were separated from the media by 584 \ncentrifugation at 5000 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and resuspended in lysis buffer (400 mM 585 \nNaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 U/mL Turbonuclease (Sigma), and 50 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0). The 586 \nresuspended cell solution was lysed using two rounds of sonication at 50% power and pulse 587 \ntime for 5 minutes, with 5 minutes on ice between sonication steps. Next, the sample was 588 \ncentrifuged at 32000 \u00d7 g for 60 minutes at 4 \u00b0C, and the soluble cell solution was separated 589 \nfrom the insoluble cell material and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore size filter.

The cleaved sample was 597 \npassed through an equilibrated Nickel -charged IMAC using a 5 mL HisTrap HP (GE 598 \nHealthcare Life Sciences), and the flowthrough was collected. This flowthrough was 599 \nconcentrated using the 3 kDa Amicon\u00ae ultra 15 mL centrifugal filters and filtered through a 600 \n0.22 \u03bcm filter. Finally, the cleaved protein was purified to homogeneity using size -exclusion 601 \nchromatography, and the HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) 602 \nwas equilibrated in size-exclusion buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5). 603 \n 604 \nProtein crystallisation and structure determination.
