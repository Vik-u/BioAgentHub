    "Materials and Methods \nYeast culture and display of trifunctional scaffoldin on the yeast cell surface \nS. cerevisiae strain EBY100 [MATa AGA1::GAL1-AGA1::URA3 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-1 \nhis3-200 pep4::HIS3 prb1-1.6R can1 GAL] transformed with pScaf-ctf32 was used for the surface \ndisplay of the trifunctional scaffoldin.   \nThe yeast cells harboring the surface display plasmid were precultured in SDC medium  (20g/L \ndextrose, 5g/L Bacto casamino acids, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) at 30\u00b0C for \n18h. For the surface display of the trifunctional scaffoldin, the precultured cells  were inoculated \ninto SGC medium (20g/L galactose, 5g/L Bacto casamino acids, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without \namino acids) at OD 600 of 0.5.  These were subsequently  allowed to grow at 20\u00b0C for 60h.                     \nS. cerevisiae EBY100 without the pScaf-ctf plasmid served as a negative control.  \nExpression and purification of PET-degrading enzymes \nSequences of g ene fragments encoding for dockerins from C. cellulolyticum  (Doc Cc) ,                              \nC. thermocellum  (Doc Ct) , and R. flavefaciens  (Doc Rf) were obtained from a previous \npublication.32 Dockerin-tagged FAST-PETase and MHETase were constructed by fusing the \ndockerins at the C-terminus of the protein of interest (POI) separated by a flexible GS linker and \ntransformed into E. coli NEB 5-alpha. \nThe constructed plasmids, pBbE8k-FAST-PETase-Dockerin Rf ( pBB8-FP-Rf), pBbE8k -FAST-\nPETase-Dockerin Cc ( pBB8-FP-Cc) and pBbE8k-MHETase-Dockerin Ct ( pBB8-MH-Ct) were  \nsubsequently transformed into E. coli SHuffle T7 for protein expression.  The cells harboring \npBB8-FP-Rf and pBB8 -FP-Cc were inoculated into fresh LB medium  containing kanamycin , \ncultured overnight at 37\u00b0C, and then scaled up at the same temperature  until OD600 reached 0.9. \nSubsequently, intracellular protein expression was induced with 10 mM L-arabinose at \n20\u00b0C/250RPM for 20h. The cells harboring pBB8-MH-Ct were grown in TB medium and protein \nexpression was induced with 1 mM L-arabinose.  \nPost-protein expression, the cells were lysed and the proteins were purified by His tag purification \n(HisPur Ni-NTA Resin, Thermo Scientific), followed by concentration and buffer exchange into \nExchange buffer (50mM HEPES, 100mM NaCl, pH 8 ) using a centrifugal filter. All purification \nsteps were performed at 4\u00b0C. Protein purity was assessed using SDS -PAGE and quantified using \nBio-Rad Image Lab software.  Protein concentration was determined using Bio -Rad DC Protein \nAssay.  \n \n \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Subsequently, purified dockerin-tagged enzymes were added and \nincubated with the yeast cells at 20\u00b0C for 1.5h with continuous shaking. After incubation, the yeast \ncells were washed with 1x PBS to remove unbound dockerins, and resuspended in Binding buffer \nfor activity assays. \nEnzyme activity assays on PET \nAmorphous PET film (Goodfellow, ES301445) was used as substrate to test the PET hydrolytic \nactivity of the whole -cell biocatalyst. PET films were hole -punched into circular films (6 mm \ndiameter) and thoroughly washed with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol , and deionized water prior to use.  \nThe PET films were added to a glass test tube containing 300\u03bcL of yeast cells (OD600 10) followed \nby incubation at 30\u00b0C and 250 RPM. Samples were collected periodically to quantify the reaction \nproducts.  \nTo terminate the enzyme reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10000g for 5 minutes \nto remove yeast cells, followed by heat treatment of the reaction supernatant at 85\u00b0C for 20 \nminutes. This reaction supernatant was subsequently analyzed using HPLC (detection wavelength \n240 nm) to quantify the formation of  MHET and TPA by comparing  against a standard curve \nprepared using commercially available standards.  \nConfirmation of scaffoldin surface display  and determination of F AST-PETase s aturation \nconcentration \nTo confirm the surface display of the scaffoldin, S. cerevisiae cells displaying the scaffoldin (OD600 \n1) were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 1x PBS. The cells were resuspended in 100\u03bcL \nBlocking buffer (1xPBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumi n) and left on a rotary nutator \nfor 1h for blocking. This was followed by incubation with the primary anti-C-myc antibody (Myc-\nTag (71D10) Rabbit mAb #2278, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200 dilution) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The \ncells were then washed with 1x PBS and resuspended in blocking buffer, followed by the addition \nof the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 ( Anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab')2 Fragment \n(Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Conjugate) #4412 , Cell Signaling Technology, 1:500 dilution) at room \ntemperature for 2h in the dark on a rotary nutator. After incubation, the cells were washed with 1x \nPBS and fluorescence was measured  using a microplate reader  (BioTek Synergy H1) at the \nfollowing wavelengths: \u03bbex = 488 nm, \u03bbem = 530nm. \nTo determine saturation concentration of FP-Rf and FP-Cc on the scaffoldin, equimolar amounts \nof both enzymes were bound to the scaffoldin using the enzyme assembly protocol. S. cerevisiae \ncells (OD600 5) containing the bound dockerins were centrifuged and washed, followed by blocking \nfor 1h in Blocking buffer . They were then incubated with the anti-C-His antibody conjugated to \nAlexa Fluor 488 (His-Tag (D3I1O) XP\u00ae Rabbit mAb (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Conjugate) #14930, Cell \nSignaling Technology, 1:100 dilution) for 1h at room temperature in the dark on a rotary nutator.  \nAfter incubation, the cells were washed with 1x PBS and fluorescence was measured ( \u03bbex = 488 \nnm, \u03bbem = 530nm).  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

It has  been reported that  higher PETase loading leads to high degradation \nperformance and even low MHETase concentrations are sufficient to boost product release  and \ncompletely convert MHET to TPA.19 Based on this understanding, we hypothesized that attaching \nFAST-PETase at two different sites would allow higher FAST-PETase concentrations than single-\nsite attachment of FAST-PETase, promoting efficient and complete PET depolymerization. In our \napproach, w e utilized FAST PETase-Doc Rf (FP-Rf) and FAST PETase -Doc Cc (FP-Cc) for \nimmobilizing FAST-PETase on the surface scaffold in and MHETase -Doc Ct (MH-Ct) for \nMHETase immobilization (Figure 1).  \nWe determined the saturation concentration of FAST -PETase on the scaffoldin  by incubating \nequimolar concentrations of FP-Rf and FP-Cc with the yeast cells (Figure S1). This concentration \nof the FAST-PETase dockerin enzymes was used for activity assays on the PET film in this work. \nMeanwhile, when wild -type yeast cells (lacking the scaffoldin) were incubated with all three \nenzymes, we observed negligible TPA formation compared with scaffoldin display cells . This \nobservation confirmed minimal non-specific enzyme binding on the yeast surface in the absence \nof the scaffoldin (Figure 2). \nStudy of PET depolymerization performance of whole-cell biocatalyst \nFollowing incubation  of S. cerevisiae  whole cells with the PET film, we quantified reaction \nproducts in the supernatant using HPLC to monitor MHET and TPA formation. When only FAST-\nPETase dockerins were present on the scaffoldin , both MHET and TPA were formed (Figure 2 , \nFigure S2).  \nWhen MH-Ct was present on the scaffold in along with FP-Cc and FP-Rf, we observed complete \nPET depolymerization, yielding only TPA as the enzymatic reaction product, with no MHET \naccumulation detected  (Figure 2, Figure S2 ). This demonstrate s that each enzyme , including \nPETase and MHETase, was active after binding to the scaffoldin , and the PETase-MHETase pair \nwas able to completely depolymerize PET with no intermediate accumulation. As expected, MH-\nCt alone did not show any activity on the PET film (data not shown). \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This difference in performance \ncould be attributed to variance in enzyme localization and access to plastics. We also explored the \neffect of having FAST-PETase at two sites (with MHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin, aiming \nto further enhance the concentration of FAST-PETase in the depolymerization reaction. The three-\nenzyme system exhibited  up to 1.63 times  better depolymerization performance than the two -\nenzyme counterparts throughout Day 4, with mean TPA yields of 2013 \u00b5M. \nIt was observed that the  total product formation was significantly boosted when MH -Ct was co-\nimmobilized with FP-Rf and FP-Cc on the scaffoldin (Figure 2A, 2B). This could be attributed to \nthe inhibitory effect of MHET accumulation in the absence of MHETase, which has been shown \nto have a detrimental impact on PETase activity.20,21 \nThroughout Day 7 (Figure 2B), the whole cells remained active, with at least a 2-fold increase in \nTPA production relative to Day 4 . Notably, b inding of  FAST-PETase at multiple sites  (with \nMHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin proved extremely beneficial, resulting in a 1.4-fold increase \nrelative to FP-Rf (with MH-Ct) and a 1.8-fold increase relative to FP -Cc (with MH-Ct). A mean \nyield of 4.9 mM TPA was obtained after 7 days of incubation with the PET film when all three \nenzymes were bound to the scaffoldin . With these results, we  successfully demonstrated the \nadvantages of immobilizing FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin for efficient and \ncomplete PET depolymerization. \n \nConclusion \nWe developed an S. cerevisiae based whole-cell biocatalyst capable of fully depolymerizing PET \ninto its constituent monomers, TPA and EG.  The PET-degrading enzymes , FAST-PETase and \nMHETase, were immobilized on the surface of the yeast cell by binding to a trifunctional scaffoldin \ndisplayed on the yeast surface in a highly  site-specific manner. TPA yields of 4.9 mM were \nachieved in 7 days at 30\u00b0C, with no observed accumulation of reaction intermediates. The \nattachment of FAST-PETase at two sites on the trifunctional scaffoldin proved advantageous, as \nPETase is required in excess compared to MHETase in the enzymatic PET depolymerization \nprocess. \nThe produced TPA and EG can be reused by both chemical and biological methods.  They can \nfacilitate the regeneration of virgin PET, enabling closed-loop PET recycling.12 Additionally, these \nproducts can be repurposed into various value-added chemicals and bioplastics  using alternative \nbiocatalysts.2,33,34 Thus, this PET depolymerization approach could pave the way for a circular \nplastic economy. \n \n \n \n \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
