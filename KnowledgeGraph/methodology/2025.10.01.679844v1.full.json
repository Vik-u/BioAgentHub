BHET was then crystallized by cooling the concentrated solution 476 \novernight at 4\u00b0C in a refrigerator, following the addition of a small volume of distilled water. The 477 \nresulting BHET crystals were collected by filtration using a glass filter, thoroughly washed to 478 \nremove any residual EG, and dried overnight at 80\u00b0C. 479 \nThe conversion of PET is calculated as follows: 480 \nPET Conversion (%) =\nWPET,i \u2212 WPET,f\nWPET,i\n\u00d7 100 (1) 481 \nWPET,i corresponds to the initial weight of PET and W PET,f to the weight of the unreacted PET, 482 \nobtained via filtration. The yield of the BHET is defined as: 483 \nBHET Yield (%) =  \nmolBHET\nmolPET\n\u00d7 100  (2) 484 \nmolPET  =  \nWPET,i\nMWPET\u2212RU\n  (3) 485 \nTextile depolymerization experiments were carried out at previously optimized 486 \nconditions51. Depolymerization experiments were performed on a Monowave 450 microwave 487 \nreactor (Anton Paar GmbH). This batch microwave reactor controls the temperature, time, and 488 \nmaximum set power. Typically, 500 mg of textiles, 5 mL of EG, and 5 mg of the catalyst were 489 \nplaced in a microwave reaction vial. The vial was inserted into the microwave reactor, and the 490 \nreactor was programmed to maintain a constant temperature. On completion of a reaction, the 491 \nreaction vial was allowed to cool down rapidly to room temperature. 100 mL of distilled water was 492 \nadded to separate BHET and oligomers. The unreacted polymer and larger oligomers were 493 \nremoved using a Whatman filter paper. The residual water from the product solution was then 494 \nevaporated under vacuum (72 mbar) at 60 \u00b0C using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting BHET 495 \nwas crystallized by cooling the residual solution overnight to 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator after the 496 \naddition of a small amount of distilled water to the residue. The resultant crystals were filtered 497 \nusing a glass filter and dried at 80 \u00b0C. 498 \nHPLC analysis 499 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Microbial upcycling of PET deconstruction products. (A) Depiction of our chemoenzymatic 711 \nplatform for pXYL production starting from PET. Catalytic glycolysis was done on polyester 712 \ntextile waste as well as PET plastic bottles . These products were then coupled with the proposed 713 \nwhole cell cascade for the biosynthesis of pXYL. Cell C was  added to resuspended PET 714 \ndeconstruction products from ( B) polyester textile waste (red shirt) and ( C) PET bottle. At 8 h, 715 \nCell D was added, and the reaction was conducted for an additional 8 h. Samples sizes are n\u202f=\u202f1.  716 \n 717 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
