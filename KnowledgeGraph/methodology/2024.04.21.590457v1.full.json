However, only limited reorientations of the enzymes on the PET surface\nwere observed (shown in yellow for newly explored surface and in brown for overlaps with\nonly distal or proximal in Fig.2A); most contacts remained unchanged for 75% or more of\nthe simulation time. In the case of proximal binding at the end of the simulations, we ex-\ntended the corresponding simulations to 2\u00b5s to see if further PET progression towards the\nactive site would occur. The general findings for both, simulations lasting for 1.5\u00b5s and the\nelongated simulations lasting for 2\u00b5s, are that when the initial contacts were established in\nproximal regions, the PET contact area remained close to the active site (PES-H1: 2 of 6;\nLCC: 4 of 6 simulations). In cases where the initial contacts were in distal areas, negligible\nprogression towards the active site was observed. Only in one of the PES-H1 simulations,\nproximal contacts could be established starting from distal ones (highlighted in yellow and\noverlaps with regions establishing distal or proximal contact only in orange in Fig.2A). The\nobserved contact progression towards proximal binding in one of the PES-H1 simulations\nmight contribute to the high activity of this enzyme.\nIf this is the case, a promising way to achieve accelerated and productive PET binding\ncould be to facilitate enhanced proximal binding while attenuating PET interactions at distal\n7\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the physicochemical\nnature of the initial enzyme\u2013PET contacts and then made rationally motivated mutations,\nwhich are studiedin silicoand in vitro.\nNegative surface charges impede PET adsorption LCC has a net charge of +5,\nwhile PES-H1 has a net charge of \u22125, which is reflected in their electrostatic potential\nsurface (EPS, shown in Fig.2B). The EPS of LCC is mostly neutral and positive (shown in\nwhite and blue, respectively), while PES-H1 features large surface patches that are strongly\nnegative (shown in red). For PES-H1 in particular, the negative regions overlap with those\nthat do not have pronounced PET contacts. In addition, we visualized the EPS of the PET\nbulk used to construct the initial enzyme\u2013PET systems. A mostly hydrophobic surface is\nrevealed, with predominantly convex and exposed areas being partially negatively charged,\nwhile stronger positive or negative potentials can be found in concave and buried regions\n(Fig.S2). We therefore assume that negative charges at the surface discourage PET binding,\nwhich could open up the possibility of preventing distal binding to PET by introducing\nnegatively charged residues there. This idea is consistent with the results of Nakamura\net al., who demonstrated accelerated binding to PET surfaces with higher positive charge\ndensity at the enzyme surface of PET2.23 In addition, Sagonget al.found that changes in the\nelectrostatic potential surface of a loop close to the active site increases PET degradation\nactivity of Rhizobacter gummiphilus PETase (RgPETase), especially when increasing the\nnegative surface charge.59 In order to transfer this finding from proximal regions to distal\nones, they mutated four distal surface-exposed arginine to alanine and glutamate, which also\nincreases the PET degradation activity.\n8\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We thus conclude that positive regions enhance overall PET adsorption and lead\nto prolonged PET retention in distal regions when present there, which in turn hinders the\nprocess of PET binding in a productive conformation at the active site.\nApolar residues contribute most to PET adsorption of PES-H1To identify the\namino acids most favored by PET, we calculated the interaction energyEint between PET\nand each amino-acid type for all six simulations of both enzymes. We then scaled the result-\ning energy values by the number of residues of the corresponding amino-acid type that were\nin contact with PET during each simulation and took the average of the six values. These\nresults are shown in Fig.2C, where we grouped the amino acids according to their physico-\nchemical property. The scaling by the contact residues accounts for the fact that more polar\nthan apolar residues are exposed in both enzymes, making them more accessible to PET than\napolar residues. The overall interaction with PET (i.e., the sum of all scaledEint values) is\nstronger for LCC than for PES-H1, with polar residues contributing most to LCC binding\nand apolar contributing most to PES-H1 binding. Charged amino acids contribute the least\nto PET binding for both enzymes, followed by the aromatic ones. Given the progression\nfrom distal to proximal binding observed for PES-H1 but not for LCC in this study, we\npropose that modification of the surface of LCC to make it more similar to that of PES-H1\ncould increase proximal PET binding for LCC and thus its enzymatic activity. Based on\nour research findings, it appears that the PET binding is excessively strong, which leads\nto extended retention in unproductive adsorption orientations.

This adjustment should\nfacilitate the enzyme\u2019s reorientation following its initial attachment to the PET surface. The\ngoal is to promote closer and more favorable binding without excessively compromising the\noverall adsorption capability. This should be achieved by eliminating strong PET interac-\ntions with polar LCC residues and by promoting weaker interactions with apolar residues.\nThis design strategy gains support from previous studies that revealed that enhanced activ-\nity of PET hydrolases is associated with increased enzyme hydrophobicity.25\u201327 In addition,\na reduction in the hydrophobicity of LCC in proximal areas has been demonstrated to re-\nduce the binding to a PET surface, resulting in increased enzyme activity due to increased\nconversion of degradation intermediates and consequently elevated TPA production.60\nDistal introduction of alanine and negative charge reduces local interaction with\nPET To verify this assumption, we generated threein silico variants per enzyme, each\ncontaining three mutations.

    "simulations, the energy function of PET is changed in a way that the energy barriers for\nits conformational changes become smaller. We applied these changes to five of the six\nreplicas we considered per HREMD simulation, with the height of the barriers decreasing\nwith increasing replica number. The changes applied to the energy function correspond to\nincreased simulation temperatures, which we will use in the following discussion. For the\nstarting structures of these HREMD simulations, we extracted three conformations from\nthe previous 2\u00b5s MD simulations, in which the binding of the enzyme to a PET bulk was\ninvestigated, with the selection criterion of a distance between the catalytic serine and PET\nof at most 5\u00c5. In addition, we retained only the PET-9mer closest to the enzyme and\nremoved four units from it, leaving a PET-5mer closest to the catalytic serine (Fig.5A). This\nresulted in different starting structures for both enzymes, which were submitted to HREMD\nsimulations with 115ns per replica. For LCC we performed five HREMD simulations and\nfour for PES-H1 (Tab.S1). In these simulations, and later in the simulations for LCCIG and\nPES-H1FY, we found that one of these three starting structures (designated 4thL) had the\nhighest number of PET-5mer entry events. Therefore, for the later HREMD simulations\nof the enzyme variants, this particular starting structure was preferentially used, unless the\nmutation site was significantly closer to the PET-5mer in another starting structure, which\nwas then used instead. These HREMD simulations enabled to observe several entry events\nof the PET-5mer into the active site and how this led to the formation of productive binding\nstates, which we distinguish into pro-S and pro-R states (Fig.5B).

Once the entry is complete, the system\nremains in low-energy replicas. This observation explains why PET entry did not occur in the\nearlier conventional MD simulations and confirms our assumption that this process involves\na significant energy barrier that must be overcome. Since the current results could be due to\nthe changes we made to the system, i.e., removing the PET bulk, we performed conventional\n115ns MD simulations for the three HREMD starting structures (two LCC and one PES-H1\nsimulations) to see if PET-5mer entry still occurs. However, this was not the case and no\nproductive PET state were sampled. Additional MD simulations were conducted at 343K,\na temperature recently proposed as optimal for enzymatic PET hydrolysis.4,64 These simu-\nlations are crucial for surpassing the energy barrier for PET entry. The simulations resulted\nin pro-R and pro-S states for PES-H1 and LCC when simulated with a single PET-5mer.\nOne of the LCC simulations that encompassed the entire PET bulk yielded a pro-S state.\nIn order to decipher the source of this energy barrier, we conducted further analyses\nand defined specific criteria for the identification of productive PET-5mer entries and their\ncorresponding outside, entry, and inside phases: (1) An entry leading to the adoption of\na productive state, either pro-S or pro-R, must have taken place and involve a decrease\nin the SER\u2013C distance from >6\u00c5 (outside phase) to <4\u00c5 (inside phase). (2) The entry\nphase must last at least 100ps and a maximum of 5ns to minimize noise through in and out\nmovements. (3) The inside and outside phases must each last at least 1ns. The inside phase\nends when the SER\u2013C distance exceeds 6\u00c5 and the outside phase ends when this distance\nfalls below 4\u00c5, or, in the case of more gradual changes, when the SER\u2013C distance exceeds\n4\u00c5 on average over the entire inside phase and falls below 6\u00c5 on average over the entire\nouter phase. Based on these criteria, we identified 29 productive entries for LCC and 15\nfor PES-H1, corresponding to 4.35% and 6.49% of the corresponding MD frames.

The pro-R pose was identified via docking studies performed by Tournier\net al.,3 but others later found in QM/MM studies that the pro-S pose is energetically more\nfavorable63,65 and that robust binding of a state unfavorable for hydrolysis could inhibit\nPET degradation activity.66 Thus, although several pro-R poses were sampled in our study,\nhydrolysis is expected to occur mainly via pro-S poses. Our analysis of the PET-5mer\nbinding events further shows that the two units that share the ester bond to be hydrolyzed\nare tightly bound to the enzyme, which is required for the reaction to proceed, while the\nother PET units interact rather loosely with the enzyme and remain flexible. This finding is\nevidenced by the different snapshots in Figs.5B, S3 and S5, which show the conformational\nfreedom of PET units that do not interact directly with the active site. This finding is in\ncontrast to earlier assumptions about a long binding cleft that has several subsites to bind\nseveral PET units simultaneously.46,67\nFromtheanalysisthusfaritcanbeconcludedthatPEThastoovercomeanenergybarrier\nfor entry into the active site to adopt productive conformations. This energy barrier could\nbe driven by conformational changes of PET to fit into the binding cleft.

To assess the impact of the intramolecular PET-5mer interactions on the\nenergy barrier during entry to the binding cleft, we calculatedEint between PET units during\nproductive entries. In several instances, we observed robust interactions between multiple\nPET units prior to entry, suggesting an inhibitory effect (Fig.S3A). Conversely, individual\nenergy peaks corresponding to favorable intramolecular interactions were detected shortly\nbefore or during entry, which probably facilitate the necessary structural rearrangements and\ninterrupt the inhibitory interactions (Fig.S3B). In addition, in some cases, entry-promoting\neffects were found due to newly formed interactions between two units during and/or after\nentry (Fig.S3C).\nTo more comprehensively assess the predominant interactions throughout all simulations\nofbothLCCandPES-H1, asopposedtofocusingonindividualentryevents, weconcatenated\nthe HREMD data using all replicas, with the higher replicas weighted, for either enzyme and\ncalculated 2D free energy surfaces (FESs) (Fig.S4). One coordinate in these FESs are the\ninteraction energies between two PET units that are not directly adjacent, which allows\nus to monitor the intramolecular PET-5mer interactions. To correlate this with the PET-\n5mer entry, we used the SER\u2013C distance as a second coordinate and distinguish between\nproductive and non-productive regions with a cut-off value of 4\u00c5. All FESs indicate that\nnon-productive PET-5mer states and also those during entry with SER\u2013C distances below\n6\u00c5 but above 4\u00c5 are energetically stabilized, which suggests that PET\u2013PET interactions\nhinder rather than promote PET-5mer entry into the active site.\nIn our opinion, the most promising approach to overcome this inhibitory effect is to\nimprove the preprocessing of PET waste.

This is\nalso consistent with arecent studyby Schubertet al., in which chain mobilityand the number\nof available sites for endo-type chain scission, which depend on the degree of crystallinity, are\npostulated as the activity-limiting factor causing the initial lag phase for the release of the\nsoluble product.7 Another biotechnological approach to mitigate this hindering effect could\nbe to design enzymes to introduce residues that enhance enzyme\u2013PET interactions, which\nwould promote and counterbalance the loss of PET\u2013PET interactions upon entry into the\nbinding cleft.\nPET\u2013enzyme interactions can also hinder PET entryNext, we analyzed the con-\ntribution of intermolecular interactions between the PET-5mer and enzyme to the observed\noverall energy barrier during PET-5mer entry. To this end, we first examined individual\nentry histories and identified effects that promote or inhibit entry by calculatingEint be-\ntween the PET-5mer and residues within 3\u00c5 during entry. PET-5mer entry can be hindered\nby strong PET\u2013enzyme interactions prior to entry or by repulsion of PET-5mer within the\nbinding cleft, so that PET-5mer states outside the cleft are favored (Fig.S5A). Conversely,\nan entry-promoting effect has favorable interactions during entry, which facilitate structural\nPET-5mer rearrangements that overcome PET\u2013PET interactions (Fig.S5B). Furthermore,\nPET-5mer entry gets supported through stabilizing interactions for productive PET5-mer\nposes, which compensate for the loss of PET\u2013PET interactions (Fig.S5C).\nTo obtain a more general overview, FESs were created using a similar approach as before,\nbut this time for the PET\u2013enzyme interactions. The SER\u2013C distance was again used as a\ncoordinate to monitor the entry process, while Eint between the PET-5mer and selected\nresidues was used as another coordinate. The selection and mutation of certain residues\nallow us to investigate the specific, and sometimes different effects of amino acids in both\nenzymes.

The resulting FESs reveals\ndistinctive PET\u2013enzyme interaction patterns for WT and mutated residues (Fig.6). Mu-\ntations at positions PES-H1FY 209/LCCIG 243 stabilize productive states in both enzymes,\nwhich can be inferred from new free energy minima (in yellow/brown colors in Fig.6) at\nSER\u2013C distances below 4\u00c5 and less pronounced minima for distances above 6\u00c5 after mu-\ntation, suggesting weaker interactions with the PET-5mer in latter states. In contrast, the\neffects at positions PES-H1FY 92/LCCIG 125 and PES-H1FY 94/LCCIG 127 differ between\nthe two enzymes. In the case of LCCIG, entry of the PET-5mer after either mutation is\npromoted due to the elimination of non-productive energy minima resulting from weakened\ninteraction with the PET-5mer for SER\u2013C distances above 6\u00c5, whereas in PES-H1FY, the\nentry of the PET-5mer after the mutation becomes more difficult due to increased interac-\ntion with the PET-5mer in non-productive states. We therefore conclude that the increase in\nPET degradation activity could result from a direct promotion of PET entry by the mutated\nresidues for LCCICCG, but from different mechanism for PES-H1FY.\n22\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Our aim was to identify residues that\nlack entry-promoting FES features and are therefore promising mutation targets to improve\nPET entry ability. FES features to be introduced include the creation of free energy minima\nin the productive region with a SER\u2013C distance below 4\u00c5, indicating stabilized productive\npositions of PET-5mer, the elimination of free energy minima in the non-productive region,\nindicating reduced interactions with PET-5mer, and the facilitation of the transition from\nthe non-productive to the productive region by avoiding energy barriers there. The residues\nthat we identified as promising mutation sites were then mutated to glycine or alanine;\nlarger amino acids were not introduced to avoid creating steric hindrances. In addition, the\nPES-H1FY H184S variant was simulated, in which the mutation site is located near a highly\nconserved tryptophan (PES-H1: W155, LCC: W190) adjacent to the binding cleft and whose\n\u2019wobbling\u2019 presumably increases catalytic activity.45 Mutation of H184 to a serine is likely\nto increase the flexibility of this tryptophan due to the lower steric requirements of serine.\nThis resulted in a total of 14 mutation sites that were evaluated for each enzyme.

In many cases the overall goal of the\nin silicomutations to facilitate PET-5mer entry into the active site was achieved. For these\ncases the FES is shown in Fig.S7, and they include mutations with improved stabilization\nof productive states (PES-H1FY: S68A, D93A; LCCIG: T211G, N246A), reduced interaction\nin non-productive states (PES-H1FY: S68A, R91A, D93A, N212A; LCCIG: T192G, S241G),\nor smoother transitions towards productive states without intermediate states where the\nPET-5mer could get trapped (PES-H1FY: S68A, D93A; LCCIG: HIS164A, T211G, S241G,\nN246A). The PES-H1FY H184S variant could neither improve the interactions at position\n184 nor the interactions of the \u2019wobbling\u2019 tryptophan with the PET-5mer.

It should be noted that one of these\nmutants, PES-H1FY L175A, is a borderline case, as a state slightly above the 4\u00c5 crite-\nrion applied to the SER\u2013C distance became stabilized; we nonetheless included it in our\nexperimental evaluation, which is discussed below.\nKinetic experiments reveal an increase in activity for the PES-H1FY S68A muta-\ntion In order to link simulation and experiment, the activity of the mentioned mutations\nintroduced in the PES-H1FY and LCCICCG enzymes was determined. The percentage weight\nloss of the PET films shown in Fig.4 indicates that none of the variants resulted in a signifi-\ncant increase in the degradation activity. PES-H1FY R91A, LCCICCG T192G, and LCCICCG\nN246A showed significantly lower degradation activity than PES-H1FY and LCCICCG, re-\nspectively. Interestingly, these are also the three variants with the least promising FES\nprofiles among the ten selected variants (Fig.S7). The FES improvements in these mutants\nwere mainly related to the destabilization of the non-productive states, while the productive\nstate did not gain in stability. In LCCIG N246A, on the other hand, while the productive\nstate was stabilized, also a non-productive state at SER\u2013C distances of\u22486.5\u00c5 became more\nstable, which could explain the reduction in activity for this variant. In addition, there is\nalso the possibility that other factors may influence the experimental outcome and thus mask\nimprovements due to mutations. It should also be mentioned that the reproducibility of the\nexperiments was problematic despite uniform experimental conditions in all experiments,\nwhich we suggest can be attributed to influences of the inherent properties of the PET films\nsuch as crystallinity or molecular weight distribution.16\nTo reduce potential masking effects and identify subtle effects on individual steps in\nPET degradation, we analyzed the degradation kinetics using a previously described tur-\nbidimetric assay using PET nanoparticles (PET-NP) that measures turbidity changes at\n600nm over time.14,69 Here, not only the substrate load[S0] was varied while maintaining\n25\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

For the other two PES-H1FY\nvariants, higherinvKm values than for PES-H1FY suggest a decreased affinity, which is sup-\nported by similar trends in themolarKm values. For LCCICCG the results are less clear. The\nhigher invKm values for LCCICCG H164A and LCCICCG T211G than for LCCICCG are not\nmirrored by the corresponding molarKm results, which are lower, while the turnover rate\nconstant kcat could also not be improved. For the LCCICCG S241G variant a reduction in\nmolarKm, a similar molarKm value as for LCCICCG and an increase in kcat were observed,\nbut these improvements are not statistically significant (Tab.S3). Combining affinity and\nturnover rate intomolar\u03b7 = kcat/molarKm yields the molar catalytic efficiency. First, it should\nbe noted that a higher catalytic efficiency was observed for all LCCICCG variants than for the\nFY variants. A comparison of these figures per enzyme indicates that PES-H1FY S68A and\nLCCICCG T211G outperform FY and LCCICCG, respectively, while LCCICCG S241G shows\na slight improvement. Thus, the most promising mutations revealed by experiments are\nalso the mutations with the most promising FES changes (Fig.S7). In particular for the\nT211G mutation in LCCICCG we succeeded in creating a smooth free energy path leading\nto the productive state, which corresponds to the largest increase inmolar\u03b7 with respect to\nthe parent enzyme for all variants studied. With the S68A mutation in PES-H1FY we were\nable to abolish the stabilization of unproductive states, while the productive state gained\nstability, yet not as much as with T211G in LCCICCG.\nIn ourin silicomutation strategy, we have restricted ourselves to alanine and glycine as\ntarget amino acids. Given the promising, yet not perfect results for the PES-H1FY S68A vari-\nant, we decided to investigate the effects of side-chain size, polarity, charge and aromaticity\nat that position. To this end, we generated additionalin silicovariants (S68I, S68F, S68Q,\nS68D, S68K), run HREMD simulations per variant and analyzed the resulting FES (Fig.S8).\nThe results reveal that our original strategy to mutate PES-H1FY S68 to alanine was a good\nchoice, as mutating this residue to any other residue stabilizes non-productive states and\n27\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We therefore conclude that interactions with this residue are\ngenerally not beneficial for PET entry, which is best avoided by removing steric hindrances\nas realized in the PES-H1FY S68A mutant.\nIn conclusion, we were able to define PET entry features by comparing the FES of\nresidues of the respective parent enzyme with their mutations, which allowed us to link the\nFES appearance with the enzymatic activity measured in experiments. The FES approach\nallowed us to identify residues that potentially hinder PET entry, and PES-H1FY and LCCIG\nvariants were generated in which these residues were mutated and evaluated computationally\nand experimentally. This analysis confirmed our idea that changing the FES so that PET can\nmoreeasilyentertheactivesitebyremovingenergytrapsbeforereachingtheproductivestate\nand stabilizing the latter, which was best realized in PES-H1FY S68A and LCCICCG T211G\nand resulted in higher catalytic activity. With respect to the experimental results it should\nbe noted thatinvKM, in contrast toconvKM, reflects how effectively the enzyme can operate\nat different enzyme concentrations for a given substrate load. Considering the results of both\napproaches, it seems conceivable that the efficiency of the enzymes has increased especially\nat low enzyme concentrations, while their PET affinity has not necessarily improved. This\nwould be advantageous in industrial applications where the substrate concentration is high\nand the enzyme concentration is relatively low and adaptation is impractical for cost or\nfeasibility reasons.\nPrincipal component analysis reveals that PET can enter via three pathwaysTo\ncomplete our comprehensive analysis of the PET entry into the binding cleft, we next present\nthe complete pathway of how the PET-5mer reaches its final productive state in the active\nsite. In doing so, we do not limit our analysis to the assumption that there can only be one\nsuch pathway, but attempt to identify all possible pathways.

This generated a large dataset that is suitable for a\nmeaningful principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA was applied to the distances of\nthe PET-5mer ester carbon, which becomes productively bound after entry, to all C\u03b1 atoms\nof the corresponding enzyme within 10\u00c5. This allows to capture the dynamics during the\nPET-5mer entry without introducing bias by pre-selecting specific residues. The resulting\nprincipal components (PCs) are used to calculate the free energy (\u2206G) along the first two\nPCs, which account for 86% of the variance and are shown as FESs in Fig.S9A,B.\nTo identify productive and non-productive states in these FES presentations, we pro-\njected them into the PC1\u2013PC2 space (indicated by green and rose color in Fig.S9A,B). This\nshows that the productive states are clearly separated from non-productive states and that\nthe productive states are localized in the\u2206G minima regions. We further analyzed the\ncontributions of amino acids mainly involved in the PET-5mer entry by their contributions\nto PC1, which reveals 49 relevant amino acid positions, which account for 62% of the data\nvariance (Fig.S9C). The involvement of so many positions highlights how complicated the\nentry pathway of a polymer such as PET into the active enzyme site is. This complexity also\nchallenges the applicability of collective variable-based methods, such as metadynamics,77\nfor the targeted sampling of entry pathways. HREMD simulations, as used in this study, do\nnot restrict the conformational PET space to be sampled, but simply increase the space that\nis generally sampled, thus providing a suitable approach. Inspection of the FES along the\nPCs of the enzyme\u2013PET contacts also shows that the PET-5mer does not enter the active\nsite via an exclusive pathway, but has three such preferential entry routes in both enzymes.\nFor each of these three pathways, a representative trajectory is projected onto the FES and\nalso structures of both enzymes (Fig.7).\n29\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As for\nthe second-preferred route, the LCC shows a preference for the direct entry of PET-5mer\nas found in the second pathway, which is also better defined than in PES-H1, while in the\nlatter these arguments apply to the third pathway.\nThe pathway preference may be influenced by the interactions with certain residues and\ntheir contribution to PC1, the principal component that mainly distinguishes the three path-\nways from each other (Fig.S9C). Amino acids with a negative contribution predominantly\ninfluence the negative range of PC1, impacting the first pathway located at negative PC1\nvalues. Conversely, amino acids with a positive contribution primarily affect the positive\nrange of PC1, influencing the third pathway situated at positive PC1 values. The magni-\ntude of the amino acid contributions reflects their respective strengths. The second pathway\ncorresponds to PC1\u22480 and therefore has no significant amino acid contributions along PC1.\nThe positions mutated in PES-H1 and LCC correspond to amino acids that contribute to\nPC1. Among the three positions mutated in the more active IG and FY variants, two\ncontribute negatively to PC1 (PES-H1FY: 94/LCCICCG: 127 and PES-H1FY: 92) and thus\nprimarily affect the first pathway, which has been identified as the most important for both\nenzymes. The other mutation in LCCICCG contributes to the positive PC1 direction and\nconsequently to the third pathway (LCCICCG: 243). For several of the positions that we\npreviously analyzed in terms of the FES reflecting their interaction with the PET-5mer, we\nhere find a strong contribution to PC1. In particular, position 68 of PES-H1 makes the\nlargest contribution to PC1, which turned out to be the PES-H1FY variant with the highest\ncatalytic efficiency after its mutation from serine to alanine (Tab.1). Together with position\n209 in PES-H1 (which corresponds to position 243 in LCC and emerged as important for the\nLCCICCG\u2019s activity3), position 68 lines one end of the catalytic binding cleft and might, thus,\nconstitute a sterical hindrance when the predominant entry pathway is attempted (Fig.S6) .\nFor LCC, we had identified position 241 as a promising mutation site, which also contributes\nto the first entry pathway.\n31\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

For both PES-H1 and LCC, we have identified\none pathway as the predominant one, which is identical for both enzymes and is consistent\nwith the findings by Falkensteinet al., who proposed this pathway as the PET entry path-\nway.52 However, the plausibility of stepwise PET degradation through \u2019hopping and sliding\u2019\nand successive cleavage of PET ester bonds as the primary degradation mechanism appears\nless tenable.\n3 Conclusion\nIn this study, we systematically investigated the binding trajectory of PET to LCC and PES-\nH1, aiming to deepen our understanding of the adsorption process and PET entry into the\nbinding site. To this end, we designed the study approach summarized in Fig.8. We started\nwith examining the initial adsorption of the PET hydrolases at a large amorphous PET bulk\nusing conventional atomistic MD simulations and explored the subsequent entry of PET into\nthe catalytically active site using enhanced-sampling HREMD simulations. Each simulation\nstep involved analyzing the energetics of the different binding phenomena to identify enzyme\nresidues that either promoted or hindered these events. This analysis was complemented by\namino acid mutations, initially evaluated through additional simulations and subsequently\nvalidated through experimental measurements in the wet lab.\nOur primary finding regarding the PET surface binding is that heightened adsorption\naffinity, facilitated by the introduction of positive surface patches and polar residues, may\nnot correlate with improved enzymatic activity. This conclusion aligns with the Sabatier\nprinciple, underscoring the importance of balancing binding affinity across enzyme regions,\nboth proximal and distal to the active site, with enzymatic activity optimization.

In each of these pathways, two\ncritical sources of energy barriers may impede PET from accessing the active site and assum-\ning a productive state. One arises from intra- and intermolecular PET-PET interactions,\nrequiring resolution for the linear binding cleft to accommodate a long, flexible PET chain.\nThe other potential hindrance stems from PET interactions with amino acid residues along\nthe pathway. Our analysis, including free energy surface and principal component analysis of\nthese interactions for wild-type and mutant LCC and PES-H1 enzymes, reveals that energy\nbarriers may result from the stabilization of unproductive states. Conversely, facilitating\na seamless energetic transition from unproductive to productive states and stabilizing the\nlatter could enhance enzymatic activity. This theoretical deduction finds support in kinetic\nexperiments involving the S68A mutant of PES-H1FY and the T211G mutant of LCCICCG.\nHowever, it should be noted that the variants we identified to facilitate PET incorporation\ndid not show a significant increase in PET degradation activity. This can be explained by the\nfact that we did not investigate the PET hydrolysis step itself and the subsequent product\nrelease, which are also of great importance for enzyme activity in addition to PET entry\ninto the active site. Future studies should therefore investigate the effects of the mutations\ninvestigated here on the activation energy barrier of the hydrolysis reaction using QM/MM\nsimulations and their influences on the resulting product complexes.\nIn summary, our pioneering methodology synergizes HREMD simulations and free en-\nergy analyses to dissect substrate entry pathways and pinpoint barriers. This approach\nunveils critical insights into the intricate pathways traversed by polymers during degrada-\ntion, enabling the development of mutation strategies to enhance enzyme kinetics. Here, our\ncomputational simulations have significantly advanced the understanding of PET hydrolase\nmechanisms and offer invaluable guidance for future engineering endeavors aimed at maxi-\nmizing PET hydrolase applicability.
