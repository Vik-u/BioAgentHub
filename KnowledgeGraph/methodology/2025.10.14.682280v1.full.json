    "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of apo-EstS1 and EstS1-BHET complex to study the \ninteraction dynamics of EstS1 esterase with BHET was performed over a period of 1 \u03bc s. The \nanalysis of the MD simulation trajectory revealed high stability of the EstS1 esterase when \npresent in complex form as compared to the apo-protein. The RMSD values ranged within a \nnarrow range of 0.20 to 0.30 nm in complex form compared to 0.15 to 0.35 nm for the apo-\nform of the protein, indicating high stability of the complex (Schreiner et al., 2012) (Figure 6 \nA). The least variation in Rg values within 1.81 to 1.85 nm disclosed high compactness of the \nprotein during the simulation trajectory of 1 \n\u03bc s (Filipe & Loura, 2022) (Figure 6 B). The RMSF \nversus residue plots showed a reduction in fluctuation in residues ranging from Tyr181 to \nPro239 in complex form compared to the apo-protein. These residues contribute to the cap \ndomain, which mediates the entry of the substrate. The reduction in fluctuations in the cap \ndomain in complex form discloses that binding of the substrate at the catalytic site imparts \nstability to the cap domain during the simulation (Benson & Daggett, 2012) (Figure 6 C). The \nsolvent accessible surface area analysis during the trajectory time showed variation in the range \nof 127 to 140 nm\n2 in complex form, while the variation in apo-form ranged from 123 to 144 \nnm2, in turn showing reduction in solvent accessible surface area and hence increase in \ncompactness and stability of the protein in complex form (Durham et al., 2009) (Figure 6 D). \nThe variation in secondary structures showed an increase in the alpha-helicity and a significant \ndecrease in the coiled structures in the complex form compared to the apo-form of the enzyme, \nindicating high stability of the complex form (Coskuner-Weber & Caglayan, 2021) (Figure 6 E \nand F). The steepness of the free energy landscape of EstS1-BHET complex revealed \nattainment of global minima or a properly folded low-energy state during the trajectory, as \ncompared to local minima or partially folded states observed in the apo-protein (Maisuradze et \nal., 2010) (Figure 7 A and B). The consistent intermolecular hydrogen bonding between EstS1 \nand BHET showed effective interaction during the trajectory at the active site of the enzyme \n(Bondar & White, 2011) (Figure 7 C). The clustering analysis of the 1 \n\u03bc s trajectory disclosed a \nlarge number of structures in the top 10 clusters (Figure 7 D). The superimposition of the \nrepresentative structures of the top 10 clusters revealed that the BHET was consistently bound \nat the active site, interacting with the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole residues (Phillips et \nal., 2011) (Figure 7 E). Thus, the present analysis provides compelling evidence for the highly \nstable and consistent interaction of BHET at the active site of EstS1 esterase.  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Microscopic analysis of PET film for degradation in controlled conditions at 25 \u00b0C \nand in environmental conditions in soil \nThe biochemical, crystal structure, and molecular dynamics simulation-based analysis \ndisclosed the efficiency of EstS1 esterase in degrading BHET, a monomer of PET film. To \nevaluate the PET film degrading efficiency of the EstS1 esterase, the crystalline PET film was \nsoaked with the EstS1 esterase for a duration of 15 days in controlled temperature conditions at \n25 \u00b0C. The SEM analysis of the PET film after a duration of 15 days displayed erosion and \ncracks on PET film, revealing efficient EstS1-mediated degradation of crystalline PET film \nvisible at a 1000X to 10000X magnification (Figure 8). Further to analyze the efficiency of \nPET degradation in natural environmental conditions, the PET film was incubated in soil \naugmented with EstS1 esterase and soil without the enzyme as a control sample.

Discussion \nEnzymatic degradation of PET plastic is being intensely investigated to deal with the major \nfraction of accumulated PET plastic in the environment, which is responsible for increasing \nplastic pollution. Diverse PETases, BHETases, cutinases, lipases, and esterases have been \nstudied for their efficiency in degrading different PET varieties, including amorphous PET, \nnanoPET, semi-crystalline PET, and crystalline PET. Several studies have engineered these \nenzymes to enhance their thermostability and efficiency to a greater extent (Bell et al., 2022; \nCui et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; Pfaff et al., 2022).  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The present study elucidates the BHET and PET \ndegrading ability of the EstS1 esterase utilizing biochemical, structural, in silico , and SEM \nanalysis-based approach. Around 75% degradation of BHET by EstS1 esterase was observed \nover a period of 1 h, resulting in the formation of MHET and TPA, concluding the ability of \nEstS1 esterase to convert BHET into MHET and then MHET into TPA. Previous study on \nStreptomyces strains characterized the BHET-degrading potential of Streptomyces LipA lipase \nvariants and identified mild TPA formation compared to MHET, with low activity above 40 \u00b0C \ndue to the lack of enzyme stability at high temperatures (Verschoor et al ., 2024). EstS1 \nesterase, a highly thermostable esterase, annotated as triacylglycerol lipase, produced a \nsignificant concentration of TPA as compared to the MHET. HtDLH, a thermostable hydrolase \nof Hydrogenobacter thermophilus reported for PET, BHET, and MHET degradation, shows \ncomparable BHET degradation to EstS1 esterase (Almeida et al., 2024). Several other studies \nreported engineered PETase enzymes having high catalytic activity against BHET, while the \ncatalytic efficiencies of wild-type enzymes were comparable to that of EstS1 esterase analyzed \nin the present study (Bell et al., 2022; Pfaff et al., 2022; Numoto et al., 2020; Kitadokoro et al., \n2012; Sulaiman et al., 2011). \nTo illustrate the structural aspects of BHET interaction at the active site of EstS1 esterase, the \nco-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET was determined and revealed not \nonly the presence of the active form of EstS1 esterase in the crystal form, but also the density \nof MHET and ethylene glycol along with BHET. The bound MHET (the product of BHET \ndegradation) at the active site depicted the exact second tetrahedral intermediate conformation \nof the canonical serine hydrolase mechanism. The cap domain, which mediates the substrate \nspecificity, varies in length in different esterase and PETase enzymes (Distaso et al ., 2023). \nThe cap domain of EstS1 of 59 residues forms cavity 1, which mediates the entry of the \nsubstrate. The two methionine (Met186 and Met207) residues of the EstS1 esterase, lying in the \ncap domain, provide a proper orientation to the substrate to interact with the catalytic triad, thus \nmediating catalysis. Similar contributions of the cap domain residues in mediating effective \nsubstrate binding have been reported in previous studies on MHETase (Knott et al., 2020). Joo \net al., 2018, in their structural analysis of IsPETase, reported Met161 and Ile208 as the lead \nresidues providing a hydrophobic surface for substrate binding, similar to the hydrophobic \nresidues Met186 and Met207 present in cavity 1 of the EstS1 esterase (Joo et al., 2018).

The \nlarge cap domain of EstS1, compared to the other PET-degrading enzymes, provides a massive \nscope for further enzyme engineering studies to improve its efficiency (Luan et al., 2016).  \nThe complex structure of the Ser154Ala active site mutant of EstS1 in complex with BHET \nexhibited the presence of two BHET molecules bound in the catalytic tunnel of EstS1, one after \nthe other, demonstrating the significant size of the tunnel to accommodate the PET polymer. \nFurther, in silico  structural analysis displayed high stability of the EstS1 esterase in the \npresence of BHET, directing towards highly favorable interactions of BHET with the active site \nresidues of the enzyme. The free energy landscape of the EstS1-BHET complex showed \nattainment of the stable low-energy state of the enzyme (Benkovic et al., 2008).  \nMoreover, the erosion and indentation of crystalline PET film surface in the presence of the \nenzyme in both controlled conditions and soil system with varying temperature conditions \nconfirmed effective crystalline PET degradation potential, high stability, and ionic tolerance of \nEstS1 esterase. Though several studies have analyzed the PET film degradation using \namorphous PET film, nano PET, and PET microplastics, very few studies have been conducted \nfor the degradation of crystalline PET in conditions mimicking the original environment \n(Wilkes et al., 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024; J. Kim et al ., 2023). The XPS-based surface and \ndepth profiling analysis discovered a higher concentration of nitrogen in the treatment sample \ncompared to the extremely low concentration in the control samples. Also, the formation of -C-\nO-, -C-N-, -C=O-, -C=N-, -N-H-, and -N=O- bonds was observed to increase in the treatment \nsample while the prevalence of these bonds was less in the control samples, thus proving the \ndegradation of the PET film (Doren et al., 1994). Further, the atomic concentration versus \ndepth plot showed a lower proportion of carbon on the surface of the enzyme-treated sample \ncompared to the control sample in turn indicating erosion of the surface. Similar increase in \nnitrogen concentration in enzyme treated PET film have been observed in past studies \nindicating effective degradation and production of nitrogen conjugated products containing -C-\nN-, -C=N-, -N-H- and -N=O- bonds along with increased formation of -C-O-, and -C=O- bonds \nwas reported (Huang et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024)  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Its efficiency in degrading crystalline PET plastic and its \nmonomer BHET have been evaluated, along with its in-depth structural analysis, displaying the \nmechanism of degradation. Hence, it can be further exploited for enzyme engineering studies to \ndevelop into a high-efficiency PET as well as phthalate diester plasticizer-degrading enzyme, \nproviding a complete solution to the increasing plastic and plasticizer pollution.   \n4. Conclusion \nGlobal plastic pollution has drawn widespread concerns due to its adverse impacts on all life \nforms across the globe. PET-based plastics are leading contributors to the increasing plastic \npollution. Bioremediation of plastics using potential enzymes is a safe, eco-friendly, and \neffective approach. In this piece of work, we have identified the BHET and PET degrading \npotential of a EstS1 phthalate diesters-degrading pH-tolerant and thermostable esterase from \nSulfobacillus acidophilus DSM10332 strain. The kinetic and LC-MS-based analysis disclosed \nup to 75% degradation of BHET, a PET monomer, into MHET and terephthalic acid. Complex \ncrystal structures of wild-type and mutant forms of EstS1 esterase with BHET have \ndemonstrated the mechanistic insights of the enzyme, representing the cap domain residues as \neffective contributors responsible for the proper orientation of the substrate at the active site. \nFurther, the cavity 1 formed by the cap domain was identified as the exact entry site for the \nsubstrate to mediate the reaction. In silico analysis of the EstS1-BHET complex exhibited that \nthe enzyme attains a highly stable, low-energy folded state in the presence of substrate. \nEventually, the variations in elemental composition and chemical bonding via XPS and \ncorroded surface and indents on the surface of crystalline PET film via SEM analysis were \nobserved in incubated PET film with EstS1 esterase, which provided strong evidence for the \nPET degradation potential of EstS1 esterase in constant and varying temperature conditions, \nmimicking the environmental variations. Henceforth, further enzyme engineering of EstS1 \nesterase can provide a highly potent solution to the exponentially growing plastics as well as \nplasticizer pollution to attain the goals of a sustainable environment.   \n5. Materials and Methods \n5.1.

The transformation of the confirmed plasmids was done in E. \ncoli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the mutant protein was purified using the above-mentioned \nprotocol.",
    "5.5. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis \nThe co-crystal structure of Ser154Ala mutant EstS1-BHET was used to study the dynamics of \ninteraction of BHET within the active site tunnel using the molecular dynamics simulation \napproach. The alanine residue at the active site was mutated to a serine residue using Coot \nsoftware to analyze the actual mechanism of interaction of wild-type EstS1 with BHET. The \napo and the BHET complex forms of EstS1 were subjected to 1 \n\u03bc s MD simulations each using \nthe GROMACS 2020 software (Pronk et al ., 2013). The CGenFF web server was used to \ngenerate the topology of BHET, and the CHARMM36 force field was used for the topology of \nthe protein (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2009; Huang & MacKerell, 2013). The dodecahedron box \nwas used for solvation of the apo and complex structures of the EstS1 esterase, and the systems \nwere neutralized using sodium ions. The energy minimization of the systems was performed \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Then the minimized systems were equilibrated using \nNumber of particles, V olume, Temperature (NVT) and Number of particles, Pressure, \nTemperature (NPT) ensembles for 100 ps each. Eventually, the MD simulation run of 1 \n\u03bc s each \nwas performed for both the apo and BHET complex systems.  \nThe analysis of the MD simulation trajectories was performed by evaluating variations in Root \nMean Square Deviation (RMSD), Radius of gyration (Rg), Root Mean Square Fluctuation \n(RMSF), Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), Secondary Structure (SS), and number of \nhydrogen bonds during the trajectory (Hollingsworth & Dror, 2018). The Principal Component \nAnalysis (PCA) was performed for all the trajectory frames, and the free energy landscapes \nwere generated for both the apo-protein and complex form of the protein (David & Jacobs, \n2013). The clustering analysis to study the effective interactions of BHET with the catalytic \ntunnel of EstS1 was done considering an RMSD cutoff of 0.2, and the representative frames of \nthe top 10 clusters were superimposed to study changes in the structure in complex form and \nthe interaction mechanism of EstS1 with BHET (Abramyan et al., 2016). All plots of the MD \nsimulation analysis were prepared using Origin 2024 software ( https://www.originlab.com/\n), \nand images of representative clusters showing 3D interactions of BHET with EstS1 were \ngenerated using PyMol software (https://www.pymol.org/) (Rigsby & Parker, 2016).  \n5.6. PET film degradation analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging \nThe small pieces of crystalline PET films (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) were soaked in the \npresence of EstS1 esterase (15 \u03bc M) for a duration of 15 days at 25 \u00b0C. Control samples without \nprotein using 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 were also prepared. After 15 days, the \nsamples were collected and washed with 70% ethanol and distilled water to remove traces of \nenzyme and buffer. The morphological analysis of films was done for both enzyme-treated and \ncontrol samples using a scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher, Apreo S Low Vac, 2011) \nat 15 kV accelerating voltage. Film samples were gold-coated at 18 mA for 140 s. Digital \nimages were generated using Apreo SEM imaging software (Yan et al ., 2020; Ducoli et al., \n2023).  \n5.7. Analysis of PET film degradation in natural conditions \nThe ionic composition of soil often poses an inhibitory effect on the enzymes present in the \nsoil. To analyze the effect of soil ionic composition on EstS1 PET degradation activity, the PET \nfilm was cut into small pieces of equal weight and incubated in samples containing soil+buffer \n(soil control), and soil+buffer+EstS1 (soil treatment). The soil used for the experiment was \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The clean soil was subjected to autoclaving at 15 psi for 20 min to remove the \npossibility of any other microbe enhancing the degradation. 6 g of autoclaved soil was used in \neach soil sample (treatment and control).15 \n\u03bc M of enzyme concentration was used in the \ntreatment samples of soil, and an equivalent volume of buffer was used in the control sample. \nAll control and treatment samples were kept outside in native environmental conditions in \ncovered small glass bottles to mimic the in situ conditions of temperature (ranging from 40 \u00b0C \nin the afternoon to 28 \u00b0C at night) and pressure for 15 days (Liu et al., 2023). The degradation \neffect of EstS1 esterase in treatment versus control samples was analyzed using a scanning \nelectron microscope (EVO 18, Carl Zeiss, 2012, and ZEISS SmartSEM software) at 15 kV as \nmentioned above. The PET film samples were washed with 70% ethanol before SEM analysis, \nfollowed by distilled water to remove any traces of soil and enzymes. All experiments were \nperformed in triplicate. This experiment provides scope for the direct in situ application of the \nEstS1 esterase in soil for PET plastic degradation (Y an et al., 2020; Ducoli et al., 2023).  \n5.8. PET film degradation analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis \nTo further analyze the change in surface chemistry due to the degradation of the PET film by \nEstS1 esterase, the surface analysis of the PET film was performed by X-ray photoelectron \nspectroscopy. The PET film (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) samples incubated with EstS1 \nesterase (15 \n\u03bc M) for 15 days, along with control samples incubated with an equivalent volume \nof 100 mM phosphate buffer in natural environmental conditions in small glass bottles, were \nsubjected to XPS analysis. The PET samples were washed with 70% ethanol and twice with \ndistilled water to remove any traces of enzyme and buffer from the samples. The change in \ncarbon, oxygen, and nitrogen elements\u2019 composition, chemical state, and bonding was studied \nup to a depth of 50 nm by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI 5000 Versa Probe III; \nUlvac-Phi, Inc). Ultrahigh vacuum of 2 * 10\n-7 Pa with Al K\u03b1  monochromatic source of energy \n1.48 keV was used. The beam diameter of 100 \u00b5m, stage tilt angle of 45\u00b0, charge neutralizer \nwith 15 V and 20 \u00b5A, and non-conductive tape as substrate were used for the analysis. Survey \nscan spectra were collected with an energy of 280 eV and 0.05 eV energy step. The high-\nresolution spectra of C1s, O1s, and N1s were recorded with 55 eV pass energy and 0.05 eV \nenergy step. The C1s standard at 284.80 eV was considered as a reference. To analyze the \nchemical bonds, the carbon C1s and oxygen O1s region peaks were fitted. The Multipak XPS \nsoftware for deconvolution and data analysis was used (Doren et al., 1994). \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
