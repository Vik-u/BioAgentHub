    "BROTTetal. 193\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe combination of mass production of single-use plas-\nticproducts,plasticlongevity,andinsufficientwasteman-\nagement has resulted in an accumulation of plastic in\nthe environment over the last few decades [1]. Glob-\nally, approximately 368 million tons of plastic were pro-\nducedin2019alone[ 2].Polyethyleneterephthalate(PET),\na semi-crystalline thermoplastic composed of the two\nmonomericunitsterephthalicacid(TA)andethylenegly-\ncol (EG), linked by ester bonds, is one of the mass-\nproducedpetroleum-basedsyntheticpolymers[ 3,4].More\nthan 50 million tons of PET are annually produced glob-\nally, with the main applications being synthetic fibers in\nthetextileindustryandbeveragebottlesinthepackaging\nsector[5,6].\nRecyclingisaviabledisposalsolutionforexistingplas-\ntic waste in terms of energy savings, material efficiency\nand circularity, for which the use of enzymes can be an\nalternative option [7]. PET has hydrolysable ester back-\nbonesandisthusmoresusceptibletoenzymaticdegrada-\ntionthanpetrochemicalvinylplasticswithsolelycarbon-\ncarbon backbones [8, 9]. Several enzymes capable of\ncleaving PET have been discovered in recent years [10].\nThese PET hydrolases belong to the enzyme classes of\ncarboxylesterases [11], lipases [12] and cutinases [13\u201316].\nWhencomparedtochemicalrecyclingmethods,theuseof\nenzymesprovidesanenvironmentallyfriendlyandenergy-\nsaving alternative that also reduces the use of hazardous\nchemicals [7]. Although the industrially-relevant use of\nenzymes in PET degradation is still in its early stages, an\nengineered variant of the leaf-branch compost cutinase\n(LCC) has already enabled nearly complete depolymer-\nization of pre-treated PET bottle waste and virgin poly-\nmers were re-synthesized using the recovered TA [17]. A\nsignificant milestone in PET breakdown was the identi-\nfication of the Gram-negative aerobic\u03b2-proteobacterium\nIdeonella sakaiensis by screening of 250 environmental\nsamplesobtainedfromaPETbottlerecyclingsiteinJapan\n[1",

In homologous enzymes, these\nserine and isoleucine residues are replaced by histidine\nor phenylalanine, respectively, restricting the movement\nof the tryptophan and thus lowering the activity for PET\ndegradation[28].\nU n l i k eL C Co rT f C u t 2f r o mT. fusca, IsPETase is a\nmesophilic enzyme with a melting point (Tm) of approx-\nimately45\u25e6C,anditisthusthermallyunstableforapplica-\ntionsathighertemperatures[ 16,29,30 ].Thecrystallinity\nof PET influences the efficiency of enzymatic PET degra-\ndation[16,31].Thepresenceofhighlyorderedcrystalline\ncontentinaspecificPETsamplereducestheoverallmobil-\nity of the polymer chains and their accessibility to enzy-\nmatichydrolysis[ 29,32].Incomparison,theless-ordered\namorphous fraction is significantly more susceptible to\nenzymatic attack at a reaction temperature close to the\nglass transition temperature (Tg)o fP E T[29].

For instance, an improvement of\nIsPETaseactivitywasachievedbytheR280Asubstitution\n[20]. Docking studies showed that the polar arginine\nresidue in the binding pocket ofIsPETase hinders stable\nbinding of PET, therefore the substitution of the arginine\nresidue by small hydrophobic amino acid residues leads\ntoincreasedactivity[ 20].Sonetal.generatedan IsPETase\ntriple mutan",
