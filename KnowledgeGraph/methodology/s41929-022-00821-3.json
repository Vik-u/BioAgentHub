The lowest energy docking pose is shown in \nFig. 4a, with the PET oligomer (2-hydroxyethyl-(monohydroxyet\nhyl terephthalate)\n4, 4PET) occupying a shallow, extended binding \ncleft. The \u2018wobbling\u2019 tryptophan, Trp185, a feature that is thought \nto aid substrate binding and catalysis in the wild-type enzyme\n20,35, \nis present as a single conformer in apo -HotPETase and is suitably \npositioned to accommodate the docked 4PET in a productive pose \nfor catalysis (Fig. 4b). Extensive remodelling of the loop region con-\nnecting \u03b27-\u03b15, including introduction of a bulky Tyr214, leads to \na new \u03c0-stacking interaction with Trp185 that restricts its confor -\nmational freedom (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7d). A hydro -\ngen bonding network involving Trp185, Tyr214 and the terminal \nhydroxyl group of 4PET also contributes to the stabilization of the \ndocked oligomer within the binding cleft.\n0.1\n0.3\n0.5\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n8.0\n5 h\n24 h\n5 h\n24 h\n5 h\n24 h\nMHET + TPA released (mM)\nMHET\nTPA\ncryPET\npowder\nMilled bottle-\ngrade PET\nPET/PE\ncomposite film\nPE\nPET\n+ HotPETase No enzyme\na b\nFig. 3 | Biocatalytic deconstruction of a range of PET-based materials by HotPET ase. a, Bar chart showing the mean concentration of released PEt \ndegradation products, MHEt (blue) and tPA (yellow), produced following reaction of HotPEtase at 60\u2009\u00b0C over the course of 24\u2009h, using 0.4% total \nsubstrate loading (4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) and 0.29\u2009mg\u2009g\u22121 enzyme loading (0.04\u2009\u03bcM).

These modifications led to a substantial \n7.5 \u00b0C reduction in T m and compromised catalytic performance at \nelevated temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 8). Catalytic activity at \nlow temperatures is minimally affected, suggesting that in the heav-\nily engineered HotPETase, the fixed conformation of Trp185 is not \ndetrimental to catalysis. Combined, these results indicate that a flex\n-\nible Trp185 is not a prerequisite for efficient PET deconstruction.\nConclusions\nThe catalytic performances of PETases have previously been \nimproved through rational engineering using computational meth\n-\nods, providing an important basis towards the development of com-\nmercially viable PET depolymerases. However, the engineering of \nindustrial biocatalysts is most commonly achieved through directed \nevolution. The notable lack of PETases engineered using laboratory \nevolution probably reflects the challenges of developing suitable \nhigh-throughput, quantitative methods for analysing the catalytic \ndeconstruction of insoluble polymers. Here, we have developed \nan automated directed evolution platform for engineering plastic \ndeconstructing enzymes and showcase its use through the develop\n-\nment of an evolved thermostable PETase (HotPETase, Tm = 82.5 \u00b0C), \nthat can operate at the glass transition temperature of PET and \ndepolymerizes semicrystalline PET more rapidly than previously \nreported PETases. HotPETase is able to deconstruct commercial \nbottle-grade PET and can selectively deconstruct PET in a PET/\nPE laminated packaging material, highlighting the potential ben\n-\nefits of enzymatic depolymerizations for real-world samples with \nminimal pretreatment or processing. Structural characterization \nof HotPETase highlights formation of the intended Cys233-Cys282 \ndisulfide bridge and improved packing of the central \u03b2-sheet region, \nwhich probably aids thermostability, alongside the presence of a sin\n-\ngle well-defined conformer of Trp185, indicating that flexibility of \nthis tryptophan is not a prerequisite for effective catalysis. To maxi\n-\nmize the use of our platform moving forward, it will be important \nto interface our evolution methods with alternative strategies for \naugmenting biocatalyst function, including computationally guided \nengineering\n36, introduction of polymer binding domains 37 and the \ndevelopment of multienzyme complexes38. Likewise, combining and \noptimizing biocatalytic deconstructions with enzymatic monomer \nupcycling methods will be an important avenue for exploration39,40. \nIn all cases, detailed techno-economic and life-cycle analysis will \nplay a crucial role in assessing commercial viability, as well as defin-\ning target parameters for future biocatalyst engineering7,8.\nIn the future, we anticipate that by adapting the selection pres -\nsures of our directed evolution workflows, we will be able to engi -\nneer a suite of useful biocatalysts with complementary functions \nand improved activities under process-relevant conditions. For \nexample, we can extend catalyst stability and lifetime by increas\n-\ning reaction times and temperatures, optimize biocatalysts to act \non alternative plastic substrates or enhance enzyme specificities in \norder that they operate on single polymer components from mixed \nplastic waste streams. In doing so, our laboratory evolution platform \nwill contribute to a biocatalytic recycling strategy to recover value \nfrom plastic waste.\nMethods\nGene construction. The genes encoding IsPETaseTS (IsPETase S121E, D186H, \nR280A, signal sequence removed as by Son et al.24) and LCCICCG (LCC F243I, \nD238C, S283C, Y127G, signal sequence removed as by Tournier et al.16) were \ncommercially synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies as gBlock fragments \nwith codon optimization for expression in Escherichia coli cells. The IsPETaseTS \ngene was cloned into the NdeI (5\u2032 end) and XhoI (3\u2032 end) sites of a pBbE8K vector \nmodified to contain a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag coding sequence following \nthe XhoI restriction site\n41, to form pBbE8K_IsPETaseTS. The gene encoding \nLCCICCG was cloned into the NdeI (5\u2032 end) and XhoI (3\u2032 end) sites of pET-22b \nvector (Novagen) leading to fusion to a C-terminal hexa-histadine tag coding \nsequence, to form pET-22b_LCC\nICCG. Nucleotide sequences and expressed amino \nacid sequences of the genes used and plasmid maps of the vector constructs are \nprovided in Supplementary Figs. 17\u201319.\nLibrary construction. Rounds 1\u20136: iterative saturation mutagenesis. In each \nround, 24\u201330 residues were selected and individually randomized using cassette \nmutagenesis. Positions were chosen for mutation on the basis of a range of factors, \ndetailed in Supplementary Table 1. For residue identification via the Protein One \nStop Repair Shop webserver\n42, IsPETaseWT was used as the input protein (PDB \n5XJH), with all constraints fixed to the default settings; positions identified more \nthan twice by the software were selected for mutation. For residue identification \nvia the B-fitter software\n43, IsPETaseWT was again used as the input protein \n(PDB 5XJH); the 15 top positions ranked by highest B-factor were selected for \nmutation. DNA libraries at chosen residue positions were constructed via standard \noverlap-extension PCR, using degenerate primer pairs (containing an NNK codon \nat the position to be mutated) and pBbE8K_IsPETase\nTS as the template for round \n1, with the most active clone discovered at the end of each directed evolution cycle \nserving as the template for subsequent rounds. Primer sequences are provided in \nSupplementary Table 2.\nShuffling by overlap-extension PCR. After each round of evolution, beneficial \ndiversity was combined by a process of DNA shuffling. Fragments were generated \nby overlap-extension PCR using designed primers that encoded for either an \nidentified beneficial mutation or the parental amino acid.

The resulting genes \ncontained all possible combinations of mutations (from two to five mutations \nper gene) and were subsequently cloned into the pBbE8K vector as described \npreviously.\nVariant gene construction. HotPETase K212N, E213S, Y214S (HotPETase\nLR), was \ncreated via overlap-extension PCR with HotPETase as the template protein and \nprimers designed to encode the wild-type residues at positions 212\u2013214. Primer \nsequences are provided in Supplementary Table 3. The resulting gene was cloned \ninto the pBbE8K vector as described previously.\nProtein production for library screening. For all protein expression and screening \nof libraries, transfer and aliquoting steps were performed using a Hamilton \nliquid-handling robot. pBbE8K_IsPETase libraries were expressed in chemically \ncompetent Origami 2 E. coli cells. Single colonies from a fresh transformation were \nused to inoculate 180 \u00b5l of Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 25 \u00b5g ml\n\u22121 \nkanamycin (to maintain the pBbE8K_PETase plasmid) and 2.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 tetracycline \n(to maintain the glutathione reductase (gor) gene-containing plasmid present in \nOrigami 2 cells), in 96-deep-well plates. Each plate contained six positive controls \nconsisting of clones of the parent template, and two negative controls consisting of \nclones containing pBbE8K_RFP (red fluorescent protein). Plates were incubated \novernight at 30 \u00b0C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Expression \ncultures were then prepared by inoculating 460 \u00b5l of 2YT media containing \n25 \u00b5g ml\n\u22121 kanamycin and 2.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 tetracycline with 40 \u00b5l of overnight culture \nin deep-well plates. The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C, 80% humidity \nin a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). When an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of \n1 was reached, protein production was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose to \na final concentration 10 mM and plates incubated for a further 20 h at 19 \u00b0C, 80% \nhumidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Cells were collected by centrifugation \nat 2,900g for 10 min and the resulting pellets resuspended in a lysis mix consisting \nof 50 \u00b5l of BugBuster Protein Extraction reagent containing 10 \u00b5g ml\u22121 DNase I. \nCell lysis was initiated by incubation for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C, with 80% humidity in \na shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.) and the lysate produced diluted with 300 \u00b5l of \nreaction buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM glycine-OH (Gly-OH)). Insoluble cell debris was \nremoved via centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g to produce a clear cell lysate.\nProduction of purified proteins. IsPETase and its derivatives were expressed in \nchemically competent Origami 2 E. coli. Single colonies of freshly transformed cells \nwere cultured for 18 h at 30 \u00b0C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 \u00b5g ml\n\u22121 \nkanamycin and 2.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 tetracycline. 1 ml of the resulting culture was used to \ninoculate 50 ml of 2YT medium containing 25 \u00b5g ml\u22121 kanamycin and 2.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 \ntetracycline. Cultures were grown at 35 \u00b0C, 180 r.p.m. to an OD600 of 1. Protein \nproduction was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose (final concentration of \n10 mM) and cultures then grown at 19 \u00b0C for 20 h. The E. coli cells were gathered \nby centrifugation at 3,220g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (pH 7.5, \n50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 10 \u00b5g ml\n\u22121 DNase I). Cells were \ndisrupted by sonication and the resulting lysate clarified by centrifugation (13,500g \nfor 15 min). The soluble fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography via \napplication to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). After washing off unbound proteins with \nthe lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted \nwith elution buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl). \nProteins were desalted by application to 10DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad) and \neluted in storage buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). Protein purity \nwas confirmed by SDS\u2013PAGE and concentrations determined by measuring the \nabsorbance at 280 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 39,670 M\n\u22121 cm\u22121 \nfor IsPETaseTS-IsPETaseM2, 41,160 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for IsPETaseM3-IsPETaseM7 and \n41,285 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for IsPETaseM8-HotPETase.\nFor the cutinase, LCCICCG, the gene was expressed in chemically competent \nE. coli BL21 (DE3). Single colonies of freshly transformed cells were cultured \nfor 18 h at 30 \u00b0C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 \u00b5g ml\n\u22121 ampicillin. \n1 ml of the resulting culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of auto-inducible 2YT \nmedium containing 25 \u00b5g ml\u22121 ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 35 \u00b0C, 180 r.p.m., \nto an OD600 of 1, and then cooled to 19 \u00b0C, for 20 h. Protein purification then \nproceeded as detailed for IsPETase, with protein concentrations determined using \nan extinction coefficient of 37,150 M\u22121 cm\u22121. HotPETase exhibits a high-level of \ncytosolic protein expression (roughly 110 mg l\u22121); LCCICCG has a lower level of \nprotein expression (roughly 20 mg l\u22121) (Supplementary Fig. 20).\nLibrary screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). The clarified cell lysate \nwas incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55\u201380 \u00b0C (pre-incubation \nstep) and subjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble \nprotein precipitate formed. To initiate the PET degradation reaction, 60\u2013220 \u00b5l \nof clarified cell lysate was transferred to a 96-deep-well plate containing reaction \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) and a single 6 mm amoPET disc cut from a sheet \nin each well, to make a final reaction volume of 220\u2013400 \u03bcl. Lysate volume was \nvaried across rounds to avoid overloading the UPLC column by keeping peak \nareas below 2,000 mAu and to limit evaporation at higher reaction temperatures \nand extended reaction times. Plates were then foil-sealed and incubated for 3\u20137 h \nat 55\u201370 \u00b0C, after which reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal \nvolume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM trifluoracetic acid solution. Following \nreaction quenching, plates were foil-sealed and incubated for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C, \n80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble protein precipitate \nremoved by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC analysis sample was \nthen prepared by transferring 100 \u00b5l of the resulting reaction supernatant into a \nfresh 96-well microtitre plate and the plate foil-sealed. The most active clones of \neach round were then subjected to a second screening round, where each clone \nwas represented as a triplicate. All expression and screening protocols were as \ndescribed above, apart from overnight culture preparation, where LB media was \ninstead inoculated with 20 \u00b5l of a glycerol stock of the original overnight cultures \nfrom the library screening round. Details for the temperatures and lengths of the \npre-incubation steps, the lysate volumes added to reactions, and the temperatures \nand lengths of the reaction incubations for each round of directed evolution are \nprovided in Supplementary Table 1.\nPurified protein screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). AmoPET film \nassays with purified proteins were conducted as follows: a foil-sealed 96-deep-well \nplate containing the reaction buffer (library screening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM \nGly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its derivatives, pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi, for \nLCC\nICCG, as reported in Tournier et al.16), with a single 6 mm amoPET disc in each \nwell, was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40\u201370 \u00b0C) to equilibrate \nall reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration step). For \ndirected evolution hit retesting and beneficial diversity shuffling, purified \nproteins were incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55\u201380 \u00b0C before \nreaction set up (pre-incubation step, full details in Supplementary Table 1) and \nsubjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble protein \nprecipitate formed. The reaction was initiated by adding the purified enzymes \nto the prepared 96-deep-well plate containing reaction buffer and amoPET discs \n(final reaction conditions: 0.04 \u03bcM enzyme, 400 \u03bcl total volume). Protein variants \nwere arrayed across the 96-deep-well plate in triplicate. Plates were foil-sealed and \nincubated for up to 24 h at the desired temperature, after which reactions were \nterminated by the addition of an equal volume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM \ntrifluoracetic acid solution. Following reaction quenching, samples were incubated \nfor 30 min at 30 \u00b0C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble \nprotein precipitate removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC \nanalysis sample was then prepared by transferring 100 \u00b5l of the resulting reaction \nsupernatant into a fresh 96-well microtitre plate, and the plate foil-sealed.\nPurified protein screening using crystalline PET powder (cryPET) and \nalternative PET substrates. Crystalline PET powder assays were conducted \nas follows: a 12 ml lidded glass vial containing 5 ml of reaction buffer (library \nscreening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its \nderivatives or pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi for LCC\nICCG), with 20 mg crystalline PET \npowder (cryPET) was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40\u201370 \u00b0C) \nto equilibrate all reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration \nstep). The reaction was initiated by adding the purified protein (0.04 \u03bcM final \nconcentration) coupled with incubation at the desired temperature under agitation \nat 180 r.p.m. Samples were taken at multiple times points, quenched and prepared \nfor UPLC analysis as detailed previously. The percentage depolymerization of \nplastic was calculated using the mass of TPA and MHET produced, using the \nconcentrations of each compound as determined by UPLC. For assays under \noptimized conditions, reactions were carried out as above, using a final enzyme \nconcentration of 0.5 \u03bcM in pH 9.7, 50 mM Gly-OH buffer, 4% BugBuster.\nFor bottle-grade PET assays, bottle-grade PET pellets (bgPET, RamaPET N1) \nwere micronized using a RETSCH PM100 Planetary Ball Mill at 500 r.p.m. for \n30 min to form a powder. For PET/PE composite packaging tray lid assays, PET/\nPE composite packaging lids, thickness of 325 \u03bcM PET and 40 \u03bcM PE, were cut into \n6-mm discs. For both materials, 20 mg of the resulting prepared substrates were \nused in reactions, with reaction conditions as described above. Full characterizations \nof the PET substrates described are detailed in Extended Data Table 1.\nChromatographic analysis of reactions. UPLC analysis was carried out on a \n1290 Infinity II Agilent LC system including an autosampler with the ultraviolet \ndetector set to 260 nm, using a Kinetex XB-C18 100 \u00c5, 5 \u00b5m, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm, LC \nColumn with a stepped, isocratic solvent ratio method. Mobile phase A was water \ncontaining 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with a fixed flow \nrate of 1.1 ml min\n\u22121. Either 1 or 4 \u03bcl of sample was injected for library screening \nreactions or time-resolved purified protein assays, respectively. Following \nsample injection, the mobile phase was set to 13% buffer B for 52 s to separate \nTPA and MHET, stepped up to 95% buffer B for 33 s to separate larger reaction \nproducts and contaminants, and then stepped back down to 13% buffer B for \ncolumn re-equilibration until a total run time of 1.8 min. Peaks were assigned by \ncomparison to chemical standards prepared from commercial TPA and in-house \nsynthesized MHET, and the peak areas integrated using Agilent OpenLab software. \nUsing this method, TPA is eluted at roughly 0.4 min, MHET at around 0.6 min and \nsmall amounts of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and longer oligomers \nat around 1\u20131.2 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). TPA and MHET concentrations were \ncalculated by preparation of standard curves (Supplementary Fig. 21).\nNATuRE CATALySiS | VOL 5 | AUGUSt 2022 | 673\u2013681 | www.nature.com/ natcatal 679\nArticles Nature Catalysis\nCharacterization of PET substrates pre- and post-degradation. Polymer \ncrystallinity was determined using DSC, using 4 mg of material. DSC data were \nobtained from using a DSC 2500 TA instrument. Samples were run in triplicate, \nin series, over a \u221250 to 300 \u00b0C temperature range under a nitrogen atmosphere \nat a heating rate of \u00b110 \u00b0C min\n\u22121 in a 40 \u03bcl aluminium crucible. The number and \nweight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of polymer chains were determined \nby SEC. Samples (4 mg) were dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol (120 \u03bcl) at \nroom temperature. Once dissolved, HPLC-grade chloroform (1,880 \u03bcl) was \nadded to form a uniform, colourless solution that was filtered through a 0.24 \u03bcm \npolytetrafluoroethylene filter. SEC analysis was conducted on a system composed \nof an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with an Agilent guard column \n(PLGel 5 \u03bcm, 50 \u00d7 7.5 mm) and two Agilent Mixed-C columns (PLGel 5 \u03bcm, \n300 \u00d7 7.5 mm). The mobile phase used was HPLC-grade CHCl\n3 at 35 \u00b0C at flow rate \nof 1.0 ml min\u22121. SEC samples were calibrated against linear polystyrene standards \n(162\u20132.4 \u00d7 105 g mol\u22121).\nSEM analysis of enzymatic depolymerizations of PET/PE composite packaging. \nA section of a PET/PE packaging lid (710 mg) was fully submerged in reaction \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, 50 ml total) in a glass bottle, and \nHotPETase (0.04 \u03bcM final concentration) added to initiate the reaction. Reactions \nwere incubated at either 40 or 60 \u00b0C with agitation at 120 r.p.m. The PET/PE \npackaging lid portion was washed and a fresh buffer and enzyme solution added \neach day over the course of 6 days. The control reactions were run in an identical \nmanner, but with no enzyme added. The percentage depolymerization of the \nPET portion of each lid section was estimated from the release of MHET and \nTPA monomers, determined by UPLC analysis of the reaction supernatant taken \neach day, assuming an estimated 12.6 g l\n\u22121 PET substrate loading. The extent of \ndepolymerization was further confirmed by weight loss analysis of samples before \nand after biotransformations. Samples were analysed by SEM as follows: polymer \nsamples were sputter coated with Au/Pd (thickness 5 nm) to prevent charging \nduring SEM imaging and were observed using secondary electron imaging in a \nTescan SC Mira, FEG-SEM with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and probe current \nof approximately 2 nA.\nProtein melting temperature (T\nm) analysis. The melting temperatures (Tm)  \nof IsPETase and its variants were determined using differential scanning \nfluorimetry. For each protein, a 50 \u03bcl sample of 5 \u03bcM protein was prepared in  \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) with a final concentration of 10X SYPRO  \nOrange dye stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in an optically clear, lidded PCR \ntube (Bio-rad). Differential scanning fluorimetry melt-curve experiments were \nconducted using a Bio-rad CFX Connect 96 Real-Time PCR system set on  \nthe fluorescence resonance energy transfer channel to use the 450/490 excitation \nand 560/580 emission filters. The temperature was increased from 25 to  \n95 \u00b0C with an increment of 0.3 \u00b0C s\n\u22121. Each protein\u2019s Tm was determined from a \nmean value for the peak of the first derivative of the melt curve from three  \nreplicate measurements.\nStructure determination of HotPETase. Protein crystallization of HotPETase \nwas achieved by sitting drop vapour diffusion of 20 nl of 6 mg ml\n\u22121 protein mixed \nwith an equal volume of reservoir solution and incubated at 20 \u00b0C. Crystals \nwere observed after 72 h incubation with a reservoir solution comprising 0.85 M \nsodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0 and 0.1 M sodium chloride \n(LMB screen HT96 H7 Molecular Dimensions). Before data collection, crystals \nwere cryogentically protected with the addition of 20% PEG 200 to the mother \nliquor and plunge cooled in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at Diamond \nLight Source. Data reduction was performed with Dials and the structure \nsolved by molecular replacement using a search model derived from Is PETase\nWT \nstructure PDB 5XJH. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement were \nperformed in COOT and Phenix using phenix.refine and phenix.ensemble_\nrefinement. Validation with MOLPROBITY and PDBREDO were incorporated \ninto the iterative rebuild and refinement process. Data collection and refinement \nstatistics are shown in Supplementary Table 4. The HotPETase coordinates \nand structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under accession number \n7QVH. The 4PET docking simulations were performed in ICM-Pro and resulted \nin a number of potential docked conformations. BHET was first docked into the \nactive site using distance restraints to Ser160 and the backbone amides of the \noxyanion hole to guide the docking towards catalytically plausible conformations. \nThe position of the docked BHET was subsequently used as a template restraint \nfor the larger 4PET docking. The top ranking docked pose of 4PET had an ICM \nVLS score of \u221231.\nReporting summary. Further information on research design is available in the \nNature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nCoordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under accession \nnumber 7QVH. Data supporting the findings of this study are available within the \npaper and its Supplementary Information, or are available from the authors upon \nreasonable request.\nReceived: 11 February 2022; Accepted: 22 June 2022;  \nPublished online: 11 August 2022\nReferences\n 1.
