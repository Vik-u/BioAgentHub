    "Experimental procedures \nExpression and puri\ufb01ca?on of PETase enzymes \nDNA plasmids for wild -type PETase (PETase, I. sakaiensis , accession number: A0A0K8P6T7, \nAddgene number: #112202), hyperacNve mutant (Addgene number: #112203) and the impaired \nmutant (Addgene number: #112204) were purchased from Addgene.  Plasmids were transformed \ninto E. coli C41(DE3) (Lucigen) and inoculated on a Nutrient Agar plate containing 100 \u03bcg/mL \nampicillin (VWR; Cas: 69-52-3). Ager culturing overnight at 37\u00b0C, single colonies for each variant \nwere inoculated into a started culture of 5 mL Terri\ufb01c Broth media (Thermo ScienN\ufb01c) containing \n100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and grown at 37\u00b0C overnight in a 180 rpm shaking incubator. Each starter \nculture was then transferred into 2 L \ufb02asks with 400 mL media containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin \nand grown at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm  unNl the opNcal density at 600 nm reached 0.6 -0.8. Protein \nexpression was  induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (EMD \nMillipore Corp.; Cas: 367-93-1). Cells were then incubated for 18 to 20 hours at 20\u00b0C at 200 rpm, \nharvested by centrifugaNon at 5000 rpm for 20 min, and stored at -80\u00b0C for later puri\ufb01caNon. \nFrozen cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis bu\ufb00er (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM \nTris HCl, pH 7.4,) and lysed by sonicaNon. Lysate was clari\ufb01ed by centrifugaNon at 45,000 rpm for \n35 minutes. The supernatant was then applied to a 2 mL Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (CyNva) column \nand eluted by eluNon bu\ufb00er containing 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5. \n \nMicroscopy and image analysis \nPET \ufb01lm (Goodfellow, UK) was cleaned in puri\ufb01ed water by sonicaNon, wiped with 100% ethanol, \ncut into pieces , and dissolved in tri\ufb02uoroaceNc acid  (TFA) (Sigma Aldrich ; Cas: 76 -05-1) to a \nconcentraNon of 1  wt%. 5-7 \u03bcL of PET soluNon was dripped onto a plasma cleaned coverslip, \ncovered with a second cleaned coverslip, and the two coverslips were then separated and dried \nin air at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the coverslips were transferred to a 120\u00b0C oven for \n20 min to achieve a smooth PET coaNng , followed by  cooling at room temperature. Flow cells \nwere assembled with the PET -coated coverslips using double-sided tape. The PET s urface was \nblocked to minimize nonspeci\ufb01c protein adsorpNon by \ufb02owing 0.33 mg/mL casein into the \ufb02ow \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
