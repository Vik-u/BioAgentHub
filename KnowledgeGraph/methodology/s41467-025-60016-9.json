    "intermediates, and secondly experimental methods that provide suf-\n\ufb01cient data to support kinetic modeling. At the current stage, none of\nthese areas are well-developed for PET hydrolases, but some progress\nhas been made. For example, limitations associated with an unde\ufb01ned\nconcentration of the insoluble substrate have been addressed by\nintroducing substrate area\n60,120, or attack site density119 as proxies for\nmolar concentration. It has also proven useful to supplement the\nconventional conditions of substrate excess for steady-state kinetic\nanalysis with measurements, where the enzyme is in excess concerning\nthe substrate\n102,121. This latter experimental condition is the opposite of\nthe conventional kinetic framework, and it has been termed inverse\nMichaelis\u2013 Menten kinetics\n122. A steady-state approximation under\ninverse conditions never occurs in homogenous reactions but may be\nrelevant in two-phase systems as new reaction sites on the surface are\nreplenished continuously\n123. Parameters from inverse kinetic analyses,\nparticularly the maximal rate at high enzyme load, are of interest\nbecause they re\ufb02ect both catalytic ef\ufb01cacy and the density of reaction\nor attack sites on the solid surface. Speci\ufb01cally, a combination of\ndata obtained with either enzyme- or substrate-excess provides\ninformation on the maximal turnover (k\ncat in s\u22121), KM (Michaelis\nconstant in M), and the density of hydrolysable sites on the PET surface\n(in mol\nsites gPET\n\u22121)122. If experiments are only conducted under condi-\ntions of substrate excess,KM values will be in mass-based units, typi-\ncally g L\u22121. This parameter can be useful for comparing different\nenzymes acting on the same substrate, but as mass-basedKM values\ndepend strongly on the SSA of the substrate, it is generally not\nmeaningful to compare values obtained with different types of PET.\nWork along these lines has identi\ufb01ed some general trends in PET\nhydrolase kinetics, which are listed in Table2. For a number of the\nmost pro\ufb01cient enzymes acting on insoluble PET at moderate tem-\nperature (30\u2013 50 \u00b0C),k\ncat was 0.5\u2013 2s \u22121,a n dt h i sw a s1\u2013 2o r d e r so f\nmagnitude slower than their hydrolysis of the same bond in soluble\nPET fragments\n119,121,124. The same enzymes hadKM values in the hun-\ndredths of nM range, and taken together, this implies strong substrate\ninteractions but slow turnover compared to other hydrolases acting on\nnative, soluble substrates\n125. A molecular description of these\ncharacteristics appears to be a promising avenue for further under-\nstanding of structure-function relationships for PET hydrolases. To\nachieve this, we will need better methods to quantify the accumulation\nand decay of intermediates; both enzyme-substrate complexes and\nPET fragments. Progress curves for these intermediates will elucidate\nthe complex pathway from insoluble polymer to the monomers TPA\nand EG, and it will also provide the necessary experimental input for\nfurther kinetic modeling. Advanced knowledge in this respect\nmay help to accelerate the late stage of the industrial recycling\nprocess, which is currently thought to be hampered by these hydro-\nlysis intermediates. Finally, we encourage more experimental and\ncomputational research into the relationship between polymer con-\nformation and enzyme activity. Some reports have pointed out a\nstrong effect on catalysis of thetrans-gauche isomerism in the PET\nchain\n52,67, and it has been proposed that constraints on isomerization\nmay lessen gradually as PET chains are shortened in the enzymatic\nprocess126. Information on this would be important both for the fun-\ndamental understanding of the interfacial enzyme reaction and as a\nguide for enzyme engineering.\nConclusions and outlook\nThe increasing demand for sustainable plastic recycling solutions,\nintegral to the bio-based circular economy and climate crisis mitiga-\ntion, positions the biotechnological valorization of PET as a dynamic\nresearch \ufb01eld in the foreseeable future.\nThe successful implementation of several extensively customized\nPET hydrolases, which allow for nearly complete polymer-to-monomer\nconversion in less than 12 h on pilot or larger industrial scales\n9,29,57,\nsuggests that fast kinetics is unlikely to be the primary constraint in\nthis research domain. However, to maintain competitiveness, PET\nhydrolases, similar to other industrial enzymes, must undergo ongoing\nperformance improvements, including enhanced enzyme kinetics and\nlong-term stability, tailored pH optima, etc. Consequently, standard\nguidelines derived from research endeavors so far are discussed above\nand summarized in Box1 and Tables1 and 2. Other related research\navenues, which have received considerably less attention yet appear to\nhold signi\ufb01cant promise, should be explored with greater focus in the\nfuture. For instance, enzyme immobilization may enhance stability and\nfacilitate multiple applications\n127,128. Also, the development of syner-\ngistic enzyme cocktails may enable reduced dosages or address mixed\nplastic waste\n129, a more complex challenge within the plastic pollution\ndilemma. For the latter, a moderate temperature range of 40\u2013 50 \u00b0C\nmay be considered when extended operation time is acceptable, par-\nticularly when not all applied enzymes exhibit adequate half-lives at\nhigher temperatures.\nSimultaneously, understanding and optimizing process condi-\ntions should be afforded equal attention and effort as enzyme\nengineering in future research. This may involve optimizing melt-\nextrusion parameters\n56, investigating the feasibility of omitting energy-\nintensive micronization stages, or implementing alternative pre-\ntreatment techniques\n130, all of which could reduce the costs of the\ncurrent process11,12. A thorough understanding of the material prop-\nerties associated with degradability is urgently required to assess the\nfeasibility of current research aimed at developing highly ef\ufb01cient\nenzymes speci\ufb01cally for crystalline PET. These forthcoming research\nendeavors may address our knowledge gaps concerning the absent\ninformation in the standardized parameter set (Tables1 and 2)t h a t\ncollectively impacts the future development of industrial PET\nrecycling.\nAt the enzyme discovery stage, researchers should move beyond\nthe trivial homology-based database mining and increase the use of\nnovel bioinformatics- or AI-based tools to discover or design new PET\nhydrolase scaffolds\n29,47. Moreover, the previously underutilized clas-\nsical function-based metagenomics or microbiological techniques can\nstill be remarkably bene\ufb01cial for discovering novel sequence or\nstructural diversity of depolymerizing enzymes that have not yet been\nincluded in the digital repository.

    "tions are frequently missing. Computational modeling based on\nrecently resolved complex structures of various PET hydrolases with\nsubstrate analogues\n16 may elucidate the catalytic cycle in atomic detail.\nStill, it fails to account for other important aspects such as enzyme\nadsorption/desorption behavior and PET physical properties. Much\nevidence suggests that these latter aspects, which re\ufb02ect non-covalent\ninteractions, serve as key bottlenecks for the overall reaction.\nFig. 3 | Schematic work\ufb02ow for discovering, engineering, and\ufb01nally applying\nnovel PET hydrolases in industrial-scale waste plastic recycling (for more\ndetails, see Box1). The function-based HTS method is an essential component of\nthe work\ufb02ow. Given that agar-plate or micro\ufb02uidics-based screening involves living\ncells, which prevents the detection of PET hydrolysis at elevated temperatures,\nmicroplate-based HTS (detailed in the lower part) may have the potential to be\nprioritized. Colorimetric or\ufb02uorometric methods, sensitive at different wave-\nlengths, are optimal for the distinct quanti\ufb01cation of functional enzyme con-\ncentrations in cell lysates and the monomers released from PET depolymerization.\nThis approach enables rapid screening of large mutant libraries for ef\ufb01cient PET\nhydrolases while also producing high-quality data at a high throughput that can be\nused for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering\n116.\nPerspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60016-9\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:4684 8\nThe most explicit example of this is the resilience of crystalline PET to\nenzymatic hydrolysis. However, small, soluble PET fragments, similar\nto those used in computational analyses, can be hydrolyzed very\nquickly\n119, which also implies that the main activation barrier for the\noverall process lies outside catalytic bond breakage. The classical way\nto single out the importance of different steps in a complex reaction is\ncomparative kinetics, and this approach has two key requirements.\nFirstly, a simple yet realistic microkinetic reaction scheme, which\nintroduces rate constants for the interconversion of substrate and\nintermediates, and secondly experimental methods that provide suf-\n\ufb01cient data to support kinetic modeling.
