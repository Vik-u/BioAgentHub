    "Materials and Methods\nProtein Expression and Purification\nThe engineered variants were synthesized at GenScript (con-\ntaining a C-terminal His-tag) in a modified expression vector\npET-43.1a (+) from Novagen (Supplementary Figure S1). The\nproteins were expressed and purified as previously described. E.\ncoli BL21-(DE3) was used for expression and induced at OD600\n~0.8 by addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside\n(IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The cells were grown\nin 0.5 or 1 L TB medium and further incubated for ~18 h at\n16 \u00b0 C and agitated at 180 rpm. Afterwards, the cells were\nharvested by centrifugation at 6,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C\nand resuspended in lysis buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % (w/\nv) glycerol, 45\u03bcg lysozyme, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 20 mM imidazole)\nand lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were harvested at\n25\u2019000 g for 25 minutes. The soluble fraction of the variants was\npurified on an \u00c4KTAxpress (GE Healthcare) using a 1 mL HisTrap\nFF column (GE Healthcare), followed by automated peak\ninjection onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 prep grade column\n(GE Healthcare). Unbound protein was washed off with IMAC\nwash buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 20 mM\nimidazole) and the bound proteins were eluted using an IMAC\nelution buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 500 mM\nimidazole). The proteins were run over a Superdex S200 size\nexclusion column with SEC buffer (50 mM bicine, 100 mM NaCl,\npH 9.0), concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO concentrator\n(Amicon) and SDS-PAGE was run to assess the protein purity.\nProtein concentration was determined by nanodrop using\nProtParam calculated (Expasy) extinction coefficient at\n280 nm.\n[46]\nThe protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and\nstored in 100 \u03bcL aliquots.\nThermostability Measurement\nThe thermal stability of the purified variants was determined\nwith differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The protein was\ndiluted to a concentration of 40 \u03bcg/mL in (50 mM bicine,\n100 mM NaCl, pH 9.0). 20 \u03bcL was pipetted into a 96-well white\nPCR plate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and added 0.3 \u03bcL 75\u00d7\nSYPRO orange dye using nano-dispensing robots (Art Robbins\nPhoenix). The melting temperature shift was measured using\nthe FRET channel of a CFX96 qPCR instrument (Bio-rad) from\n20\u2013100 \u00b0 C. All protein samples were set up in six replicates.\nFigure 4. lc-PET and hc-PET (90 mg) using 2 \u03bcM Combi-PETase (PETase\nACCCETN\n)\nenzyme incubated for 2, 6, 22 and 28 hours determining the amount of TPA\nand MHET.

The reaction was initiated by adding 500 nM to 1600 nM\nenzymes and incubated for 1 to 28 hours at the enzyme\u2019s\noptimal temperature and 1000 rpm on an Eppendorf Thermo-\nMixer. To determine the optimal temperature, experiments\nbetween 30\u201370 \u00b0 C were performed. The hydrolysis reactions\nwere stopped at 95 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes and the microplastic was\ncentrifuged at 11,000 rpm for two minutes. The enzymatic\nactivity of the designed variants was measured as previously\ndescribed.\n[23]\n10-100 \u03bcL of the reaction mixture was pipetted\ninto a black 96-well plate and the volume was adjusted to\n100 \u03bcL with bicine buffer. The reaction to produce fluorescent\n2-hydroxy terephthalate (HOTP), was initiated by adding 25 \u03bcL\nof 5 mM EDTA and 25 \u03bcL of 5 mM FeSO\n4\nwith a multichannel\npipet. Finally, 25 \u03bcL of 2 % H\n2\nO\n2\nwas added by mixing the\nreaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was\nincubated for 60 min at room temperature before the\nfluorescence was measured with a plate reader from CLARIOstar\nBMG-Labtech Australia (\u03bb\nex\n= 320 nm, and \u03bb\nem\n= 420 nm). We\ninterpolated the concentration of TPA based on a calibration\ncurve of terephthalic acid (TPA) between 0\u2013500 \u03bcM. The PET\nhydrolase variants were compared to the previous variants as a\nreference to determine whether the enzymatic activity has\nincreased, and experiments were performed in triplicate.\nUPLC Analysis of PET Hydrolysis\nTo determine TPA and MHET concentrations, we employed\nUltra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) using an\nAcquity UPLC i-Class equipped with a QDa performance mass\ndetector (Waters). The chromatogram extraction was conducted\nat a wavelength of 254 nm. The UPLC system utilized an\nAcquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50\u00d72.1 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm particle\nsize). The mobile phases employed were as follows: mobile\nphase A consisted of 99.9 % Milli-Q Water + 0.1 % formic acid,\nand mobile phase B was composed of 99.9 % Acetonitrile +\n0.1 % formic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 0.400 mL/\nmin, and a sample volume of 1 \u03bcL was injected three times for\neach analysis. Following sample injection, the mobile phase\ncomposition transitioned from 95 % A to 100 % B over a 4.50-\nminute interval and remained at 100 % B for 1 minute.\nSubsequently, it was changed back to 95 % A over 0.5 minutes\nand held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. To\ninterpolate the concentrations of TPA and MHET, we prepared\ncalibration curves ranging from 0 to 500 \u03bcM by utilising the\nmass of each compound.\nProtein Crystallisation and Structure Determination\nCrystals of the PETase variants were grown by vapour diffusion\nin MRC 2 sitting-drop plates (Swissci) setting up drops at a 1 : 1\nratio with 150 nl of protein and 150 nl of mother liquor using\nthe Phoenix Crystal (Art Robbins) liquid handling platform with\ncrystallisation conditions described in Supplementary Table S8.\nCrystals grew after a couple of days and prior to flash cooling in\nliquid nitrogen were cryoprotected with a final concentration of\n15 % glycerol added to the reservoir before overlaying onto the\ndrop. Diffraction experiments were carried out at the Australian\nSynchrotron MX2 beamline\n[48]\nunder nitrogen vapor at 100K\nand a wavelength of 0.974 \u00c5. Data reduction was carried out\nwith XDS\n[48]\nfor indexing and integration followed by scaling\nand merging with Aimless.\n[49]\nAutomated implementation of the\nsame programs was utilised with autoPROC.\n[50]\nMolecular\nreplacement was carried out with Phaser\n[51]\nvia a model derived\nfrom the PDB ID 6EQE.\n[43]\nThe model was iteratively built and\nrefined with Coot 0.8.9\n[51]\nand Refmac 5.7\n[52]\n(Combi-PETase/\nPETase\nACCCETN\n) via the CCP4i2 user interface,\n[53]\nPhenix\n(PETase\nACC\n),\n[54]\nor autoBUSTER (PETase\nACCC\nand PETase\nACCE\n).\n[55]\nStatistics for structure solution and refinement are presented in\nSupplementary Table S7.\nProtein Modelling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations\nA model of the 8mer-PET substrate in complex with the wild\ntype PsPETase enzyme was build using the 6EQE model as\nstarting structure.\n[43]\nThe substrate was modelled in a step-wise\nmanner. First, a flexible molecule of Mono-(2-\nhydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET) was docked in the active\nsite (using residue S160 as the centre of the box). Then, one by\none, new moieties of MHET were added to both ends of the\nfirst molecule until the 8mer-PET substrate was finished. At\neach step, a 1\u03bcs molecular dynamics simulation was performed\nto relax the system, applying a distance harmonic constraint\nbetween the carbonyl oxygen atom of the first molecule\ndocked and the backbone nitrogen atoms of residues Y87 and\nM161 (the residues defining the tetrahedral oxoanionic binding\nsite) to ensure that the substrate remained in the active site.\nFinally, 1\u03bcs MD simulation of the 8mer-PET substrate was\nperformed without any constraint.

Without the need\nof structural information or understanding contribution of each\namino acid substitution to the biophysical properties of the\nenzyme, the ASR approach produces enzymes that are often\nmore thermostable, soluble and promiscuous.\n[29,30]\nThese prop-\nerties are very desirable in enzyme engineering and therefore\nASR has been widely used for creating new functionality in\nenzymes and to improve their properties.\n[22]\nWe recently applied\nancestral sequence reconstruction to understand the evolu-\ntionary history of PsPETase.\n[23]\nThis resulted in the recreation of\nancestral enzymes containing mutations which could not have\nbeen found by rational design methods, as they are not close to\nthe active site nor their effect could have been predicted.\nHowever, because of their beneficial effects on the thermo-\nstability and protein yield, we have introduced them as part of\nthe multi-methodological approach to obtain an improved\nPsPETase variant.\nMachine learning and deep learning methods have been\napplied to develop both novel plastic degrading enzymes as\nwell as PET hydrolase variants. Although this is an emerging\nstrategy with only a limited number of examples, a few\nremarkable studies have demonstrated the synergistic effect of\ncombining ML/AI and rational design methods. For instance,\nFAST-PETase is a variant of PsPETase that was developed\ncombining two mutations from the rational-engineered Ther-\nmoPETase and three other mutations identified with\nMutCompute.\n[13]\nSimilarly, MutCompute was applied to TfCut2\nwild type cutinase to identify beneficial mutations and create\nan enhanced variant, which exhibited a 5.3-fold improved\ndepolymerization of crystalline PET.\n[31]]\nMost recent examples\ninclude the adoption of machine learning-assisted prediction of\nthe degrading activity of certain plastics\n[32]\nor the use of\nmachine learning to guide the directed evolution of plastic\ndegrading enzymes.\n[33]\nThis paper has applied different approaches such as\nstructure-based design, ancestral sequence reconstruction and\nmachine learning to engineer a new variant of PsPETase. We\nshow that each approach has unique benefits and limitations,\nand that they can be applied to complement each other in a\ncombinatorial approach. We present a new enzyme (namely\nCombi-PETase) with improved properties that are critical for\nindustrial applications.\nResults and Discussion\nEvaluation of PsPETase Variants\nUsing the wild type PsPETase as our starting point, we have\napplied a combination of structure-based rational design,\nancestral sequence reconstruction and machine learning ap-\nproaches over six generations of engineering. We have\ncharacterized the PET hydrolytic activity, thermal stability and\nexpression levels in E. coli of over 140 variants in an iterative\nprocess of improving the enzyme\u2019s properties. We determined\nthe thermal stability of each variant by measuring the melting\ntemperature using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) ex-\nperiments and we used a fluorescence-based assay of TPA\nreleased to determine the PET hydrolytic activity (see methods).\nFigure 1 shows the characterization of the best variants that\nwere passed to the following generation, accumulating benefi-\ncial mutations in the process. The optimal temperature of the\nreaction was determined by measuring the enzymatic activity.\nFor the best variant in each generation, we determined the\noptimal temperature of the reaction by measuring the activity\nover a range of temperatures (Figure 1A\u2013C, Table 1).

This residue is directly interacting with the\nHEMT moiety, but because HEMT is a small molecule, the\nstructure does not reveal other residues that might be involved\nin binding the PET substrate. To identify these residues, we\nperformed a model of a Michaelis complex using a 8mer-PET\npolymer as a substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). Our model\nindicated that in addition to the interactions with W185, the\n8mer-PET polymer is also interacting with residues in the \u03b26-\u03b27\nloop (preceded by W185). We performed molecular dynamics\nsimulations of various substitutions at position 186 and found a\nstrong dependence of the flexibility of the sidechain of W185\nand the \u03b26-\u03b27 loop on the size of residue 186 (Supplementary\nFigure S3).\nThe beneficial effect of the flexibility of W185 and the loops\nin the active site with the PET hydrolytic activity has been also\nhighlighted by Chen et al.\n[35]\nand Crnjar et al.\n[36]\nwhen studying\nthe double mutant S214H/I218F. Based on the MD simulations,\nwe mutated residue D186 to alanine, the residue that was\npredicted to confer the highest flexibility to the wobbly\ntryptophan and the \u03b26-\u03b27 loop. The PETase variant D186A\n(PETase\nA\n) exhibited an increase in melting temperature of\n~10 \u00b0 C while at the same time retaining a high level of activity\nup even at 50 \u00b0 C. In the 1.6 \u00c5 crystal structure of our variant\nCombi-PETase (Figure 2), we refined W185 and observed that\nthe modelled density around the sidechain of W185 is not\ncompletely supported by an occupancy of 1, as well as\nadditional density adjacent but not connected to this residue.\nHowever, the additional density was not enough to confidently\nmodel a second conformation as observed in previous\nstructures.\n[37][34]\nTogether with the high B-factors on the atoms\nof W185, it does suggest that W185 is in fact flexible\n(Supplementary Figure S6A).\nD186 is not conserved in other cutinase enzymes and is\nmost commonly a histidine in thermostable homologs, so the\nsingle mutant of PsPETase D186A had not been explored\nbefore. The substitution D186H alone does not provide better\nactivity but it led to the development of ThermoPETase\n[11]\nwhich\nserved as scaffold for developing other variants like\nFigure 1.

Recently, using a semi-saturation muta-\ngenesis experiment, Yin et al. identified the double variant\nD186A/S121P. Because the crystal structure of the S121P/D186A\ndouble mutant could not resolve various conformations of\nW185 side chain, the authors explained the increased activity\nwas caused by a reduction in the flexibility.\n[38]\nHowever, the\nauthors did not note that this is also common in other crystal\nstructures of PsPETase variants, and that the different conforma-\ntions of the so-called wobbly tryptophan W185 is not always\nresolved in multiple conformations. Nailing down all the\npossible conformations is difficult- seeing that density is missing\nis easy.\nPETase\nACC\n\u2013 Generation 2\nTo further improve the thermal stability of our PETase\nA\nvariant,\nwe introduced a third disulfide bridge using the N233C and\nS282C mutations. The design of this disulfide bridge was based\non the work of Then et al., who identified a stabilizing calcium\nbinding site in TfCut2, a homolog enzyme with 51 % sequence\nsimilarity of PETase.\n[39]\nBy engineering a disulfide bridge in that\nposition, the authors mimicked the effect of calcium binding\nand increased the Tm of TfCut2 by 24.9 \u00b0 C.\n[40]\nSimilar substitu-\ntions were performed on Cut190,\n[41]\nLCC,\n[42]\nand\nThermoPETase.\n[11]\nBased on a structural alignment between\nTfCut2 and PETase\nA\n, the equivalent disulfide bridge was\nengineered between residues N233 and S282. The triple mutant\nPET\nACC\ndisplayed a cooperative effect on the thermal stability\nelevating the melting temperature by another 11.4 \u00b0 C (to\n64.7 \u00b0 C). The increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nallows\na much higher activity compared to PETase\nA\nat a reaction\ntemperature of 50 \u00b0 C. The formation of the disulfide bond\nbetween N233C and S282C was confirmed to be present and\nfully occupied in the electron density of the Combi-PETase\nstructure (Supplementary Figure S6C) and the structure of the\nPETase\nACC\n(PDB accession code 8VEL).\nPETase\nACCCET\n\u2013 Generation 3\nFurther attempts to improve the thermal stability of our\nPETase\nACC\nvariant by rational design only led to modest\nimprovements. Individually, the A179C, S136E and S214T (CET)\nmutations each increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nby\nca. 3.2 \u00b0 C, 0.9 \u00b0 C and 2.1 \u00b0 C respectively (Supplementary Ta-\nble S3). However, the effect of these mutations was additive\nand the combined mutant PETase\nACCCET\ndisplayed a Tm of\n67.8 \u00b0 C (Figure 1A, Table 1), sufficient to increase the optimal\nreaction temperature to 60 \u00b0 C.\nThe A179C variant fills a hydrophobic cavity in the core of\nthe enzyme, a strategy that is commonly used to improve the\nthermal stability of mesophilic enzymes.\n[41]\nThis effect is\napparent in the density around residue A179C in the crystal\nstructure of Combi-PETase (Supplementary Figure S6D).\nThe mutant S136E has a small effect on the thermal stability\nof the enzyme as measured by DSF, but it also showed a 1.3-\nfold increase in hydrolytic activity compared to our PETase\nACC\nvariant and was compatible with the other mutations, so it was\nretained for future generations. In the crystal structure we do\nnot see the direct formation of any new salt bridge by the\nS136E substitution, so the effect may be due to a transient\nintraprotein interaction or to an improvement in enzyme-\nsolvent interactions.\nThe S214T variant increased the enzymatic activity by 12 %\n(Supplementary Table S3). Both the crystal structure of Combi-\nPETase (this work) and of the wild type (PDB 6EQE)\n[43]\nresolve\nthe sidechain of residue 214 in three different orientations with\nsimilar occupancies. Molecular dynamics simulations show that\nin the wild type, S214 (located in \u03b27-\u03b14 loop) preferably makes\na hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of P184, located at the start\nof the \u03b26-\u03b27 loop, while the mutation to threonine (T214)\nbreaks this interaction (Figure 2F and G). This can enhance the\nflexibility of the \u03b26-\u03b27 loop and the binding site, explaining the\nincreased activity of this variant. Both A179C and S214T are\nnewly discovered mutations, while S136E has been previously\nshown present similar beneficial effects on the wild type\nsequence.\n[44]\nPETase\nACCCETN\n\u2013 Generation 4\nIn a previous publication we performed an Ancestral Sequence\nReconstruction (ASR) experiment on the wild type PsPETase, in\nwhich identified some ancestor sequences that showed\nimproved thermostability.\n[20]\nContinuing from this, we inte-\ngrated and tested several of the ASR designs into our\nPETase\nACCCET\nvariant (Supplementary Table S4) and identified the\nK95N mutation which exhibited a further increase in thermal\nstability (Tm = 70.4 \u00b0 C) and a 12 % increase in terms of\nenzymatic activity. Two directed evolution experiments ren-\ndered variants that included the K95N mutation: HOT-PETase\n[21]\nand PETaseTM,\n[43]\n(with 21 and 2 mutations respectively).\nCombining Machine Learning/AI Mutations to the PETase\nACCCETN\nA new variant (FAST-PETase) has recently been developed using\na ML-based enzyme engineering method (MutCompute)\n[13]\nand\nbased on the ThermoPETase variant. The authors predicted and\ntested 159 mutations and identified three of them (N233K,\nR224Q and S121E) that when added to the ThermoPETase\n(D186H/R280A) yielded a variant with high activity at an\noptimal temperature of 50 \u00b0 C. From the FAST-PETase mutations,\nthe N233K mutant is of particular interest, because introducing\nthis single point mutation on other homologous PET-degrading\nenzymes also produces enzymes with higher degradation rates.\nWiley VCH Dienstag, 07.05.2024\n2410 / 350675 [S. 178/183]\n1\nChemBioChem 2024, 25, e202400084 (5 of 10) \u00a9 2024 The Authors.

We introduced the N233K mutant into our Combi-\nPETase, noting that this mutation would break the engineered\ndisulfide bridge between residue N233C and S282C. Because it\nis difficult to compare the results from the literature given that\nthe reaction conditions and the substrates often differ,\n[21]\nwe\ndecided to order, express, purify and test the FAST-PETase\nsequence as from the literature but using our activity assay and\nsubstrates.\n[13]\nThe new variant derived from FAST-PETase and\nCombi-PETase (namely PETase\nAKCETN\n) showed a modest Tm\ndecrease to 67.5 \u00b0 C compared to Combi-PETase and a reduction\nof 10 \u00b0 C of the optimum temperature back to 50 \u00b0 C, same as the\nFAST-PETase variant. (Figure 1A and 1C, Table 1). The activity of\nPETase\nAKCETN\nat 50 \u00b0 C is the same as Combi-PETase at the same\ntemperature but lower than the Combi-PETase at 60 \u00b0 C.\nHowever, the yield of the PETase\nAKCETN\nvariant is much higher\n(Figure 1B, Table 1).\nAssessing the Enzyme\u2019s Suitability for Industrial Applications\nDue to higher activity and protein yields, we evaluated the\nsuitability of the Combi-PETase and PETase\nAKCETN\nvariants for\nindustrial applications. For these two variants, we performed\nlong-term reaction experiments at high temperatures and high\nenzyme concentrations, and we also tested the residual activity\nof Combi-PETase against a high-crystalline PET substrate.\nFigure 3 shows the enzymes\u2019 activity at 50 and 60 \u00b0 C for up\nto 28 hours using FAST-PETase as a control. While at 50 \u00b0 C, all\nthese enzymes perform similarly after either 2 or 28 hours\n(Figure 3A, and Supplementary Figure S4), at 60 \u00b0 C Combi-\nPETase performs better than PETase\nAKCETN\n, which in turn is better\nthan FAST-PETase.\nWild type PsPETase has been noted to show a concentration\ninhibition effect when the enzyme\u2019s concentration exceeds\n150 nM.\n[6]\nAlthough the reason for this inhibition is not fully\nunderstood, this is a problem for industrial applications. Avilan\net al. has shown that it is also present in other mesophilic\nenzymes and that it can be improved using protein engineering\nto increase the thermal stability, by adding additives to the\nreaction (e. g. DMSO), or by modifying the substrate (increasing\nthe polymer surface area).\n[45]\nHotPETase, a variant generated by\na directed mutagenesis approach,\n[24]\nis an example of a highly\nthermostable variant that shows reduced inhibition by enzyme\nconcentration. This effect is also displayed in our Combi-PETase,\nwhere we observe at least a 4-fold increase in the optimal\nenzyme concentration for the reaction (to ~800 nM, Figure 3C).\nPsPETase has been discovered to naturally break down low\ncrystalline PET (lc-PET). However, high crystalline PET (hc-PET) is\na prevalent waste product that is difficult to break down by all\nknown PETases. To determine the effect of the crystallinity of\nthe substrate on the reaction rate of our Combi-PETase, we\ntested the enzyme against both hc-PET (post-consumer Coca-\nCola bottle, ca. 45 % crystallinity)\n[46]\nand lc-PET (powdered\nGoodFellow PET film, amorphous). We measured the degrada-\ntion products (TPA and MHET) over 28 hours using UPLC\n(Figure 4). As usual for all PET hydrolases, lc-PET is more\nsusceptible to breakdown by Combi-PETase than hc-PET,\nresulting in a total of 29 mM and 19 mM of total released\nproducts respectively. However, this means that the Combi-\nPETase retains 65 % of the activity against hc-PET, which is very\nhigh compared to other PETase enzymes.\n[19,47]\nIndeed, LCC\nIGGA\nvariant retains between 25\u201335 % activity when reacting with\nmicroparticles (\ufffd 250 \u03bcm) of 32\u201335 % crystalline PET.\n[20]\nMost\nPET degrading enzymes also show less than 50 % activity\nagainst PET film substrates with 13\u201323 % crystallinity.\n[17]\nConclusions\nWe combined different enzyme engineering approaches;\nstructure-based rational design, ancestral sequence reconstruc-\ntion and mutations from AI/machine learning to develop a new\nvariant of PsPETase. We found the biggest improvements in the\nenzyme\u2019s properties from the early generations using a rational-\nbased design. By the second generation (PETase\nACC\n), the melting\nFigure 3.

Further generations also\nbased on rational design improved the thermostability by\nanother 4 \u00b0 C and the activity by 43 % but further improvements\nwere difficult. A new mutation based on the ASR method\nfurther improved the enzyme\u2019s stability by another 2 \u00b0 C and\nincreased the activity by 10 %. The SDS-PAGE gel shows that\nthe amount of soluble Combi-PETase protein was qualitatively\nincreased with respect to the wild type PsPETase (Figure S8),\nwhile the amount of purified Combi-PETase protein was\nincreased by 25-fold (Figures S9 and S10). The increased\nsolubility of Combi-PETase is also reflected in the decrease in\nthe concentration-dependent inhibition, which means that the\nCombi-PETase can be efficiently used at 800 nM concentration\ninstead of < 150 nM for the wild type PsPETase. Based on AI\nmethods, the N233K mutation was proposed. Introducing this\nmutation to the Combi-PETase variant improved the protein\nyields, but it also reduced its thermostability and activity.\nTherefore, it was not included in our final variant.\nEach technique contributed to the advancement of the\nengineered Combi-PETase (PETase\nACCCETN\n). We highlight the\nimportance of applying these approaches simultaneously as\neach of them has its strengths and limitations. The biggest\nimprovements were based on understanding the structure of\nthe protein, the substrate binding mode, and the mechanism of\naction. ASR and AI-based tools were more effective in\npredicting the impact of remote mutations on the enzyme\u2018s\nproperties, which were challenging to foresee with structure-\nbased protein engineering. Although we may not fully under-\nstand how remote mutations affect the protein\u2018s biophysics in\ndetail, their beneficial effects are evident.\nOverall, this study demonstrates a successful example of a\ncombinatorial enzyme engineering experiment, using\nstructure-, bioinformatics- and AI-based strategies. We have\nengineered the Combi-PETase variant to perform better in\nterms of protein yields, thermostability, activity, tolerance to\nhigh enzyme concentration and longer reaction times; com-\npared to the wildtype PsPETase and most of the published\nPETase enzymes. It is highly active over a range of temperatures\nand can hydrolyze not only lc-PET but also hc-PET with high\nefficiency. These are all desirable biophysical and biochemical\nproperties when considering the enzyme for industrial applica-\ntions. However, we have not upscaled the process or directly\ncompared the Combi-PETase under standardized industry-like\nconditions against other PETase enzymes as done for other\nvariants.\n[21]\nMaterials and Methods\nProtein Expression and Purification\nThe engineered variants were synthesized at GenScript (con-\ntaining a C-terminal His-tag) in a modified expression vector\npET-43.1a (+) from Novagen (Supplementary Figure S1). The\nproteins were expressed and purified as previously described. E.\ncoli BL21-(DE3) was used for expression and induced at OD600\n~0.8 by addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside\n(IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The cells were grown\nin 0.5 or 1 L TB medium and further incubated for ~18 h at\n16 \u00b0 C and agitated at 180 rpm. Afterwards, the cells were\nharvested by centrifugation at 6,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C\nand resuspended in lysis buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % (w/\nv) glycerol, 45\u03bcg lysozyme, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 20 mM imidazole)\nand lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were harvested at\n25\u2019000 g for 25 minutes. The soluble fraction of the variants was\npurified on an \u00c4KTAxpress (GE Healthcare) using a 1 mL HisTrap\nFF column (GE Healthcare), followed by automated peak\ninjection onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 prep grade column\n(GE Healthcare). Unbound protein was washed off with IMAC\nwash buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 20 mM\nimidazole) and the bound proteins were eluted using an IMAC\nelution buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 500 mM\nimidazole). The proteins were run over a Superdex S200 size\nexclusion column with SEC buffer (50 mM bicine, 100 mM NaCl,\npH 9.0), concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO concentrator\n(Amicon) and SDS-PAGE was run to assess the protein purity.\nProtein concentration was determined by nanodrop using\nProtParam calculated (Expasy) extinction coefficient at\n280 nm.\n[46]\nThe protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and\nstored in 100 \u03bcL aliquots.\nThermostability Measurement\nThe thermal stability of the purified variants was determined\nwith differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The protein was\ndiluted to a concentration of 40 \u03bcg/mL in (50 mM bicine,\n100 mM NaCl, pH 9.0). 20 \u03bcL was pipetted into a 96-well white\nPCR plate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and added 0.3 \u03bcL 75\u00d7\nSYPRO orange dye using nano-dispensing robots (Art Robbins\nPhoenix). The melting temperature shift was measured using\nthe FRET channel of a CFX96 qPCR instrument (Bio-rad) from\n20\u2013100 \u00b0 C. All protein samples were set up in six replicates.\nFigure 4. lc-PET and hc-PET (90 mg) using 2 \u03bcM Combi-PETase (PETase\nACCCETN\n)\nenzyme incubated for 2, 6, 22 and 28 hours determining the amount of TPA\nand MHET.

The reaction was initiated by adding 500 nM to 1600 nM\nenzymes and incubated for 1 to 28 hours at the enzyme\u2019s\noptimal temperature and 1000 rpm on an Eppendorf Thermo-\nMixer. To determine the optimal temperature, experiments\nbetween 30\u201370 \u00b0 C were performed. The hydrolysis reactions\nwere stopped at 95 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes and the microplastic was\ncentrifuged at 11,000 rpm for two minutes. The enzymatic\nactivity of the designed variants was measured as previously\ndescribed.\n[23]\n10-100 \u03bcL of the reaction mixture was pipetted\ninto a black 96-well plate and the volume was adjusted to\n100 \u03bcL with bicine buffer. The reaction to produce fluorescent\n2-hydroxy terephthalate (HOTP), was initiated by adding 25 \u03bcL\nof 5 mM EDTA and 25 \u03bcL of 5 mM FeSO\n4\nwith a multichannel\npipet. Finally, 25 \u03bcL of 2 % H\n2\nO\n2\nwas added by mixing the\nreaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was\nincubated for 60 min at room temperature before the\nfluorescence was measured with a plate reader from CLARIOstar\nBMG-Labtech Australia (\u03bb\nex\n= 320 nm, and \u03bb\nem\n= 420 nm). We\ninterpolated the concentration of TPA based on a calibration\ncurve of terephthalic acid (TPA) between 0\u2013500 \u03bcM. The PET\nhydrolase variants were compared to the previous variants as a\nreference to determine whether the enzymatic activity has\nincreased, and experiments were performed in triplicate.\nUPLC Analysis of PET Hydrolysis\nTo determine TPA and MHET concentrations, we employed\nUltra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) using an\nAcquity UPLC i-Class equipped with a QDa performance mass\ndetector (Waters). The chromatogram extraction was conducted\nat a wavelength of 254 nm. The UPLC system utilized an\nAcquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50\u00d72.1 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm particle\nsize). The mobile phases employed were as follows: mobile\nphase A consisted of 99.9 % Milli-Q Water + 0.1 % formic acid,\nand mobile phase B was composed of 99.9 % Acetonitrile +\n0.1 % formic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 0.400 mL/\nmin, and a sample volume of 1 \u03bcL was injected three times for\neach analysis. Following sample injection, the mobile phase\ncomposition transitioned from 95 % A to 100 % B over a 4.50-\nminute interval and remained at 100 % B for 1 minute.\nSubsequently, it was changed back to 95 % A over 0.5 minutes\nand held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. To\ninterpolate the concentrations of TPA and MHET, we prepared\ncalibration curves ranging from 0 to 500 \u03bcM by utilising the\nmass of each compound.\nProtein Crystallisation and Structure Determination\nCrystals of the PETase variants were grown by vapour diffusion\nin MRC 2 sitting-drop plates (Swissci) setting up drops at a 1 : 1\nratio with 150 nl of protein and 150 nl of mother liquor using\nthe Phoenix Crystal (Art Robbins) liquid handling platform with\ncrystallisation conditions described in Supplementary Table S8.\nCrystals grew after a couple of days and prior to flash cooling in\nliquid nitrogen were cryoprotected with a final concentration of\n15 % glycerol added to the reservoir before overlaying onto the\ndrop. Diffraction experiments were carried out at the Australian\nSynchrotron MX2 beamline\n[48]\nunder nitrogen vapor at 100K\nand a wavelength of 0.974 \u00c5. Data reduction was carried out\nwith XDS\n[48]\nfor indexing and integration followed by scaling\nand merging with Aimless.\n[49]\nAutomated implementation of the\nsame programs was utilised with autoPROC.\n[50]\nMolecular\nreplacement was carried out with Phaser\n[51]\nvia a model derived\nfrom the PDB ID 6EQE.\n[43]\nThe model was iteratively built and\nrefined with Coot 0.8.9\n[51]\nand Refmac 5.7\n[52]\n(Combi-PETase/\nPETase\nACCCETN\n) via the CCP4i2 user interface,\n[53]\nPhenix\n(PETase\nACC\n),\n[54]\nor autoBUSTER (PETase\nACCC\nand PETase\nACCE\n).\n[55]\nStatistics for structure solution and refinement are presented in\nSupplementary Table S7.\nProtein Modelling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations\nA model of the 8mer-PET substrate in complex with the wild\ntype PsPETase enzyme was build using the 6EQE model as\nstarting structure.\n[43]\nThe substrate was modelled in a step-wise\nmanner. First, a flexible molecule of Mono-(2-\nhydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET) was docked in the active\nsite (using residue S160 as the centre of the box). Then, one by\none, new moieties of MHET were added to both ends of the\nfirst molecule until the 8mer-PET substrate was finished. At\neach step, a 1\u03bcs molecular dynamics simulation was performed\nto relax the system, applying a distance harmonic constraint\nbetween the carbonyl oxygen atom of the first molecule\ndocked and the backbone nitrogen atoms of residues Y87 and\nM161 (the residues defining the tetrahedral oxoanionic binding\nsite) to ensure that the substrate remained in the active site.\nFinally, 1\u03bcs MD simulation of the 8mer-PET substrate was\nperformed without any constraint.
