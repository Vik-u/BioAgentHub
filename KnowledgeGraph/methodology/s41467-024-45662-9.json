    "Molecular docking and MD simulations\nTurboPETase was modelled by AlphaFold2. Then, the protein was\nsimulated for 20 ns. The representative structure obtained from the\nMD simulations and the crystal structure of BhrPETase (PDB ID:7EOA)\nwas used for further docking. A model substrate comprising three\nconsecutive PET units, mimicking the N-terminal and C-terminal\ngroups to cap the polymer chain at both ends, was generated.\nYASARA was employed to make molecular docking of PET to Turbo-\nPETase and BhrPETase. The highest binding energy model was selec-\nted. The selected model was subjected to local docking for 999 runs.\nThe optimized model of TurboPETase-PET and BhrPETase-PET com-\nplexes were simulated in AMBER 16\n61 using the ff16SB force\ufb01eld. The\nHis242 residue was protonated in the HID state. Cl\u2212 ions were added to\nmaintain system neutrality. The systems were then solvated in a\ntruncated octahedron box using the TIP3P water model with an 8 \u00c5\ndistance around the solute. Following solvation, the systems under-\nwent a 12,000-step minimization and were gradually heated from 0 K\nto 338 K with a collision frequency of 1 ps\n\u22121. After equilibration, 100 ns\nMD simulations were conducted for each complex, employing a time\nstep of 2 fs.\nCloning\nGenes encoding BhrPETase (GenBank accession number:GBD22443),\nLCC (GenBank accession number:AEV21261), LCCICCG (LCCF243I/D238C/\nS283C/Y127G), ICCG I6M (ICCGS32L/D18T/S98R/T157P/E173Q/N213P), FastPETase"
