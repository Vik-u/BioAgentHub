    "2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and reagents \nHP was employed as the starting point for protein engineering, and \nthe genes in Fig. 1 ( such as HP gene (792 bp) ( Bell et al., 2022 ) and the \nHLCB gene) were all chemically synthesized and codon optimized by \nTsingke Biotechnology ( https://tsingke.com.cn/ ). The pET22b ( + ) \nplasmid was used as the expression vector, and pET30(a) was used for \nthe cell surface display of PETase. E. coli DH5 \u03b1 maintained in our lab -\noratory was used as the amplification host, and E. coli BL21 (DE3) was \nemployed as the host to heterogeneously express HP and the mutants. \nAll the primers used in this study were chemically synthesized by San -\ngon Biotech ( https://www.sangon.com/ ). \n2.2. Gene cloning and construction of recombinant bacteria \nConstruction of the HP expression vector (p22-HP). The HP gene \nwas cloned and inserted into the Hind III and BamH I sites of pET22b ( + ), \nresulting in the recombinant plasmid p22-HP. \nConstruction of the fusion expression vector for HLCB (p22-"
