    "using a Quantum 270 CCD detector (ADSC, USA). All X-ray diffraction data were indexed, \nintegrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 software package.28 Molecular replacement of the \ncollected data for all variants was conducted using the CCP429 version of MOLREP,30 with \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Further model \nbuilding to align PDB files with the Fo-Fc map was performed manually using WinCoot29, \nand refinement was performed using CCP4 refmac5.29 All data statistics are summarized in \nTable S3. The final refined models of Is-4pC, Is-4pC+A180V , Is-4pC+P181V , Is-8p, Z1-\nPETase, and Z2-PETase were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB codes of 8H5M, \n8H5O, 8H5J, 8H5K, and 8H5L, respectively.31 \n \nHeat inactivation experiment \n Protein heat inactivation was investigated using a p-NPB hydrolysis assay. When p-\nNPB is hydrolyzed, butyrate and p-nitrophenolate ion s are produced, and the latter can be \nmeasured via UV/VIS spectrophotomet ry at 409 nm. IsPETase variants (200 nM IsPETase \nmutant in 200 \u00b5l of 50 mM glycine-NaOH [pH 9.0]) were inactivated at 60\u00b0C or 70\u00b0C (1\u201336 \nh) and then chilled in an ice bath for 10 min. The reaction mixture contained 1% (v/v) Triton \nX-100, 10% MeOH, 50 mM phosphate buffered saline buffer (pH 7.8; Sigma -Aldrich, \nMissouri, USA), and 1 mM p-NPB. IsPETase mutants were added to the reaction mixture to \ninitiate reaction. The protein concentration in the reaction mixture was 500 nM, and the final \nvolume was adjusted to 500 \u03bcL with distilled water. The reaction was monitored for 60 s, and \n10 s of the interval between linear-increasing sections were used as data. Each data point was \ncalculated except for the baseline, which was obtained by measuring the self-hydrolysis of p-\nNPB. All experiments were performed in triplicate. \n \nBioreactor system \n A lab-scale bioreactor (MARDO-PDA, BIOCNS, Republic of Korea) was customized \nto analyze PET depolymerization. Three sets of jars with a capacity of 500 m l were deposited \ninto the reactor. A non-contact type temperature sensor was used, and the reactor operated at a \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The temperature was regulated using a refrigeration and heating bath \ncirculator (RW3-1025, JEIO TECH, Daejeon , Republic of Korea). The pH of the reaction \nsolution was measured using a pH electrode (one-gel pH electrode with a digital display in 0.01 \nincrements). The pH meter was calibrated at two pH levels (4.01 and 7.00). For the reaction, \n2.5 \u03bcM of Z1-PETase was added to 150 m l of 10 mM Na 2HPO4-HCl (pH 8.0) in the reactor. \nSamples of transparent and colored post-consumer PET powder were added at a concentration \nof 2.5% (w/v), and the sample and enzyme were mixed with an agitation speed of 200 rpm. \nThe reaction solution was maintained at pH 8.0 through buffer titration with 0.3575 N NaOH \n(40%; extra pure grade, Duksan, Republic of Korea). The weight of added NaOH was measured \nusing a precision weighting measurement system and a micro-precision scale (EK-410i; AND, \nSeoul, Republic of Korea). Samples were taken at specific time points and then filtered using \na 0.22-\u03bcm PVDF syringe filter (SFPVDF013022CB, Futecs, Korea) to remove  the residual \nPET powder. The obtained samples were diluted with 50 mM Glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) and rTA, \nMHET, and BHET were detected using HPLC. The total amount of the released product was \ncalculated, accounting for the amount of 0.3575 N NaOH added during the process. \n \n  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
