The array of these plastic pollutants, \nof different sizes and types is also mind- boggling. While the load of plastic pollution keeps \nincreasing, driven by global demand and eventual production, means and methods of plastic \nrecycling are few and far in between and ineffective on a broader perspective. The staggering range \nof the burden is often disturbing. The yearly production of plastic waste has been projected to \nreach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050, according to the study done by World Bank [3]. \nIn an effort to limit the load of plastic pollutants, degradation of plastics using microbial sources \nhas been the subject of study over the past few decades. The polymerization of plastic is effected \nby means of weak forces like van der Waals interactions, electrostatic forces as well as hydrogen \nbonds. etc. Microbes are known to degrade plastics in a sequential manner. Broadly, this can be \nsimplified as physical or chemical deterioration, followed by breakdown of polymers which are \nthen shipped to the cytoplasm of the microbes for metabolic breakdown [3].  \nOne of the biggest sources of the pollution and perhaps the most commonly used of plastics is \nPolyethylene Terephthalate (PET). Microbial biodegradation of PET has been mooted for long and \na few breakthroughs have been achieved over the years. Enzymes from  Thermobifida fusca were \nreported from the early years of this century to be effective in the degradation of PET\n[4]. Lipases \nfrom Candida antarctica [4] and cutinases from Humicola insolens  [5] have also been known to \ndisplay PET degradation, and some of these have been shown to have synergistic effects in \nelevating the efficacy and reducing the time of the degradation process [6].  \nIdeonella sakaiensis, a plastic-degrading bacterium, was first discovered in 2016 [7]. I. sakaiensis \nis a Gram negative, aerobic, rod -shaped bacterium belonging to the genus Ideonella and family \nComamonadaceae [8]. Originally isolated from a sediment sample taken outside of a plastic bottle \nrecycling facility in Sakai, the bacterium also uses PET as a sole carbon and energy source for \ngrowth. The PETase enzyme found in the bacteria aids in the degradation of the ester bond of PET. \nIsPETase (PETase from I. sakaiensis) has demonstrated the highest plastic degradation activity \ncompared to all other bacterial enzymes despite the fact that similar enzymes have been discovered \nin a number of other organisms.  \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The PETase enzymes showed the presence of a conserved, PET-binding active \nsite. Ser (160), Asp (206) and His (237) form a highly conserved catalytic triad that aids in the \nstable binding with PET. Several mutations were introduced into the PETase enzyme of Ideonella \nsakaiensis, and wild- type bacteria were used for comparison.  [6] has also reported that mutant \nIsPETase R280A is 22.4% more effective than the wild type. According to the report, these \nvariants were more effective at higher temperatures and their plastic degradation rate was \nsignificantly higher compared to the wild type, but they are not effectively utilised for refuse \ndegradation [10]. However, wild-type bacteria have certain limitations that prevent large -scale \napplication. IsPETase in its natural state is exceedingly unstable and therefore, IsPETase have also \nbeen modified to degrade PET completely at higher temperatures [11]. \nThe mechanism and high- resolution crystal structure of IsPETase [12]  showed that the enzyme \nhas a hydrophobic cavity that binds to PET polymers and breaks the PET into monomers like bis(2-\nhydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) 13. IsPETase \nthough is incapable of hydrolyzing MHET to terephthalic  acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). \nVery recently, [14] reported that PETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus has comparable binding \naffinity for PET and hydrolysis activity at moderate temperatures. With very few substitutions in \nthe conserved domain, RgPETase was found to be  remarkably similar to IsPETase. These are \nthough, the only two instances of discovery of PET degrading bacteria till date. \nThe discovery of plastic degradation abilities in prokaryotic species is a slow process, and \ndiscoveries are few and far in between. With the knowledge of the available enzymes and the \ncouple of structures that have been solved, we therefore strived to predict the presence of such \nplastic degradation abilities in other bacterial species. The search was manifold, both at the level \nof the sequences and the conservation of the degradation domain. The hits were subjected to in \nsilico verification using structural parameters and docking tools. In this investigation, BHET was \nchosen as the substrate both due to its structural similarity to the nucleus of PET and it\u2019s ability to \nhydrolyze into TPA and EG monomers. The predicted structures and the enzymes shed light on \nthe variety of plastic degradation domains from across the prokaryotes, and also demonstrate th e \nrange of alternatives that could be explored in addition to I. sakaiensis for plastic degradation  \nmediated by bacteria. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

    "Molecular Dynamics: \nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed utilizing Gromacs 2021.3 through the \ncommand line interface [25]. Proteins were vacuum energy minimized before the actual MD \nprocedure to obtain the optimized PDB structure. The most optimal PETase was identified from \ndocking scores and RMSD, followed by subsequent 100 nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) \nsimulation, repeated over three iterations each . The simulation employed the Charmm36 \nforcefield. The protein topology file was constructed using the Gromacs software, whereas the \nligand topology file was prepared using the CGenFF server [26]. For solvating the complex, the \nTIP3P water model was used in a 1 nm -sized dodecahedron box. To counterbalance the overall \ncharge of the protein-ligand complex, an adequate amount of sodium (Na+) or chloride (Cl-) ions \nwere added. The system's energy minimisation was performed using the steepest descent algorithm \nfor 50,000 iterations to resolve steric clashes. \nThe C -rescale and V -rescale coupling approach was used for equilibration in NVT and NPT \nensemble simulations respectively, with positional restrains imposed on the protein and ligand to \npreserve its structural integrity  during the equilibration phase . The structural coordinates of the \nsystem were saved for every 10 ps by GROMACS. Generated MD trajectories were analysed in \norder to calculate root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and \nto conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The conformational stability, fluctuating \nresidues, and compactness of the protein and the protein- BHET complexes were validated using \nthe gmx rms, gmx rmsf, gmx gyrate modules of GROMACS, respectively. The Molecular \nMechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) approach was utilised to determine the \nrelative binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes. The gmx_MMPBSA tool was employed \nto compute the binding free energies of protein -ligand complexes, using 1000 frames collected \nfrom the final 10 ns (90\u2013100 ns) of the molecular dynamics simulation. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In order to mitigate the potential for poor connections and \ngeometry inside the structure, energy minimization was conducted prior to conducting the \nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  \nAmong all the PETase enzymes, HpPETase was found to be the most resilient on interaction with \nBHET (even better than IsPETase), with the RMSD values stabilizing around 0.4 nm throughout \nthe simulation, after an initial inflection (figure 5c) . In case of the IsPETase-BHET complex, the \naverage root mean square deviation (RMSD) values remained consistently below 0.5 nm for the \nwhole simulation. The HbPETase -BHET complex exhibited the third highest stability, with an \naverage RMSD value of 0.6 nm.

The \nRMSF values consistently stayed below 0.3 for all the PETases, with occasional peaks above 0.3 \n(+0.1) (figure 6). In all the figures, the curve for RMSF of the specific PETase has been contrasted \nwith the curve for IsPETase (shown in the background in grey). For the reported PETases of I. \nsakaiensis and R. gummiphilus, the RMSF values were identical and lower  in comparison to the \nother PETases. Alignment of the sequences of the PETases with the RMSF data revealed that the \nfluctuations were greater in the regions of the proteins having flexible loops, as compared to the \nmore structured regions (supplementary table 5). The N terminal residues which show increased \nflexibility are predictably the ones with greater exposure to the solvent. The peaks of significant \nintensity visible in the RMSF plot of HbPETase, KsPETase, and HpPETase (figure 6b, 6c and 6d) \nare indicative of the presence of significantly more flexible regions of the protein segment at \nmultiple places in these enzymes . The substitution and addition events observed in the sequence \nalignment have an impact on the peak heights observed in RMSF. Though the loop regions display \nincreased variability in these PETases, this has however not impacted the ligand binding, as none \nof the residues from these regions contributed to the ligand binding cavity. The residues \ncomprising the binding site of all the proteins exhibited a high degree of stability and fluctuations, \nif any were of relatively insi gnificant magnitude.

The \nsubsequent discovery of R. gummiphilus stirred the interest even more, and the past few years have \nseen renewed vigour in the quest for a naturally occurring solution to the ever-increasing threat of \nplastic pollution in the environment. The work in this manuscript would supplant and provide a \nheadstart to these efforts as it reveals a handful of prospective bacterial candidates which could be \ntapped to harness their plastic degradation abilities.  \nAll of the species shortlisted for this work have shown the presence of a conserved hydrolysis \ndomain, and some of them have been documented to hydrolyze PET and other polymers. \nSubstitution in the catalytic triad has been demonstrated to diminish enzyme activity, and sequence \nalignment confirms that the catalytic triad residues are 100% conserved across all enzymes.  \nBesides the typified Ser 160, Asp 206 and His 237 catalytic triad , the presence of a conserved \nMet161 in the vicinity has also been revealed as a major contributor to binding targets.  All the \nthree candidates have substitutions akin to the t ype IIa category of PETases, further bolstered by \nthe two conserved cysteine residues at positions 203 and 239 for the formation of an extra \ndisulphide bond (unlike type I PETases). \nThe spectrum of variation in the source of these bacterial candidates is also diverse and includes \nspecies residing in environments ranging from the marine to sub- zero habitats. Ketobacter \nalkanivorans [31], Marinobacter daqiaonensis [32], and Gammaproteobacteria bacterium [33] \nwere identified from marine sources and possess conserved hydrolase domains that may aid in the \nbreakdown of microplastics in the ocean, a major issue that plagues the environment and mankind. \nOn the other hand, Oleispira antarctica is another bacterium that could be instrumental in plastic \ndegradation at lower temperatures[34].

The MD studies of the five PETases from \nvarious species revealed significant potential in HpPETase, HbPETase, and KsPETase for plastic \ndegradation, comparable to the experimentally validated IsPETase and RgPETase. The binding of \nBHET to HpPETase , infact, showed better binding energies than the reference IsPETase and \nRgPETase, signifying improved substrate affinity. The values of the MMPBSA calculations  in \nconjunction with its RMSD plot, illustrate enhanced structural stability over time for HpPETase -\nBHET binding, when contrasted with both IsPETase and RgPETase. The same could also be \nhypothesized for the HbPETase and the KsPETase too, arguably to a lesser extent though. The \nconformational stability of the PETases during the simulation using the PCA  analysis again \nrevealed stable structural conformations for the HpPETase, comparable to IsPETase. Interestingly, \nthe PETase from R. gummiphilus (one of the validated PETases) displayed a rather diffusive \ntrajectory during the dynamics, suggesting a flexible conformation during binding interactions, \nwhich may be attributed to the presence of variable region 1 (VR1, Q26- S51), the wobbling \ntryptophan-containing loop (WW-loop, W183-S187), variable region 2 (VR2, P207-V228) and the \nC-terminal region (G271-Y292) in the structure of this PETase. Furthermore, the outputs of Free \nEnergy Landscape (FEL) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) consistently demonstrated that these \npotential PETases preserve structural integrity and compactness during the simulation duration.  \nThe PETase from H. pe rtucinogena and to some extent, H. bauzanensis can be therefore, subjected \nto experimental analysis of their plastic degradation activity. Indeed, a structure for the PETase \nfrom H. bauzanensis have been now deposited, but the reports of its activity still remains elusive. \nThe prospective PETase from Ketobacter sp. however, does not show as much promise as the other \ntwo, but in some aspects, resembles the binding interactions of R. gummiphilus and hence, can also \nbe tried for PET degradation. Although the results obtained in the current study suggest the PET \ndegradation activities of these three alone, the rest of the PETases could also be a source of plastic \ndegradation enzymes, with suitable protein engineering processes to increase their activity. In that \ndirection, the characterization of the interface in these prospective enzymes, with a detailed \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.
