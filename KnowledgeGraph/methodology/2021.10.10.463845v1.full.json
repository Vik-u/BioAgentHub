    "mutagenesis of the protein in silico. The predicted distributions were rendered onto the protein crystal 77 \nstructure ( Fig. 1a ) to identify positions where wild -type amino acid  residues were \u2018less fit\u2019 than 78 \npotential substitutions. Predictions were then ranked by predicted probabilities (fold-change of fit) (Fig. 79 \n1b; Supplementary Information Fig. 3). Using a stepwise combination strategy, a total of 159 single 80 \nor multiple predicted mutations were generated in various  PETase scaffolds.

Encouragingly, two substitutions ( S121E and T140D) were 87 \nreported in the literature after our initial predictions, whereas the remaining residues are entirely unique, 88 \nthus emphasizing the importance of a neutral , deep learning -based approach to identifying critical 89 \nsubstitutions.  90 \nWe assembled all 29 possible combinations using these four mutations across three PETase 91 \nscaffolds (wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, and DuraPETase). Of note, two could not be purified 92 \nusing the DuraPETase background after multiple attempts. Thermostability analysis of the remaining 93 \n27 mutants indicated that 24 ( ca. 89%) resulted in elevated Tm relative to their respective scaffolds 94 \n(Supplementary Information  Fig. 5 ). The highest change in thermostability from their respective 95 \nPETase scaffolds were observed for variants PETaseN233K/T140D with a Tm of 58.1 \u00baC (\u0394Tm=10 \u00baC from 96 \nWT PETase), ThermoPETaseN233K/R224Q with a Tm of 67.4 \u00baC (\u0394Tm=9 \u00baC from ThermoPETase), and 97 \nDuraPETaseN233K with a Tm of 83.5 \u00baC (\u0394Tm=5 \u00baC from DuraPETase). The latter mutant represents the 98 \nmost thermostable PETase mutant reported to date. It was noted that the protein yield of all 27 variants 99 \nwas improved (up to 3.8-fold increase) compared with the parental scaffold, further underscoring the 100 \nability of Mutcompute to identify mutants of higher stability (Supplementary Information Fig. 6). The 101 \nportability and combinatorial synergy of these mutations across scaffolds demonstrates the power of 102 \nthis neural network-based approach.  103 \nNext, we sought to evaluate the PET hydrolytic activity of these more stable variants across a 104 \nrange of temperatures from  30 to 60 \u00baC using an amorphous PET film (gf-PET, from the supplier 105 \nGoodfellow, PA, USA) commonly used in the literature4. This comparison immediately revealed that 106 \nthe machine-learning guided predictions greatly enhanced PET-hydrolytic activity and extended the 107 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In particular, PETase N233K/R224Q/S121E exhibited 108 \na 3.4-fold and 29-fold increase in PET-hydrolytic activity at 30 and 40 \u00baC respectively, over wild-type 109 \nPETase (Fig. 1d). Enzyme mutants based on the ThermoPETase scaffold showed an extended range 110 \nof working temperature (30-60 \u2070C) and exhibited significantly higher activity than their counterparts. 111 \nWithin this set, the best variant from the ThermoPETase scaffold (containing N233K and R224Q on 112 \ntop of S121E), named FAST-PETase (Functional, Active, Stable, and Tolerant PETase), showed 2.4-113 \nfold and 38-fold higher activity at 40 and 50 \u2070C, respectively compared to ThermoPETase alone (Fig. 114 \n1d). At 50 \u2070C, FAST-PETase displayed the highest overall degradation of all mutants and temperatures 115 \nactivity releasing 33.8 mM  of PET monomers in 96 hours (Fig. 1d). The DuraPETase scaffold in 116 \ngeneral exhibited relatively low activity at mild temperatures (30 \u201350 \u2070C), but improvements were 117 \nnevertheless realized a t higher temperatures (55\u201360 \u2070C) as demonstrated by the most thermostable 118 \nPETase mutant- DuraPETaseN233K (Fig. 1d).  119 \nCrystal structure analysis of FAST-PETase at 1.44 \u00c5 resolution explains the enhanced stability 120 \nthrough newly formed,  favorable residue interactions (Fig. 2). The N233K mutation places a 121 \npositively-charged lysine next to E204 and establishes an intramolecular salt bridge (Fig. 2f). The side 122 \nchain of R224, when mutated to Gln, forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of S192 (Fig. 2d). 123 \nFinally, the S121E mutation enables a new water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network with H186 and 124 \nN172 (Fig. 2d). 125 \n To evaluate the catalytic resilience of these mutants to environmental conditions, FAST-126 \nPETase were compared to previously reported wild-type and mutant PHEs including wild-type PETase, 127 \nThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC, the most active mutant LCC  F243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM) using 128 \ngf-PET across a range of pH (6.5 \u2013 8.0) and temperatures (30-40 \u2070C) (Supplementary Information Fig. 129 \n7). This comparative analysis demonstrated the unique catalytic capability of FAST-PETase to 130 \nfunction at low pH levels and ambient temperature. Specifically, FAST-PETase outperformed other 131 \nPHEs (including prior rational designs) at all pH conditions. Especially at pH 7, FAST-PETase 132 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This enzymatic performance makes FAST-PETase 134 \nan excellent candidate for mild temperatures and moderate pH enzymatic degradation of PET seen in 135 \nconditions of in situ plastic degradation.  136 \n Beyond model plastic substrates, it is critical to demonstrate the performance of PETase 137 \nenzymes on raw, untreated pc -PET. Notably, unlike the gf -PET used above and throughout the 138 \nliterature, there is no singular pcPET substrate. To this end, we collected 51 samples of post-consumer 139 \nplastic products used in the packaging of  food, beverages, medications, office supplies, household 140 \ngoods and cosmetics available at local grocery store chains and treated this raw material enzymatically 141 \nwith FAST-PETase at 50 \u00baC (Supplementary Information Fig. 8). Despite their heterogeneity including 142 \nphysical properties such as crystallinity , molecular weight, and thickness as well as different 143 \ncompositions including additives and plasticizers, hole-punched samples from this wide array of PET 144 \nproducts were all fully degraded by FAST-PETase within one week and in as little as 24 hours  (Fig. 145 \n3a). While thickness of the plastic did correlate with degradation time (as thickness and mass are 146 \nrelated), neither this metric nor crystallinity or any other measured trait of PET alone determined 147 \noverall degradation rates (Supplementary Information Fig. 9). 148 \nAmong the post-consumer products tested above, we further evaluated the sample from a bean 149 \ncake container that was completely degraded by FAST-PETase within 24 hrs at 50 \u2070C. A time-course 150 \nanalysis (Fig. 3b) revealed that the degradation of this pc -PET film exhibited an almost linear decay 151 \nrate using FAST-PETase in terms of the total PET monomers released. Concomitantly, degradation of 152 \nthe pc-PET film by FAST-PETase brought an increase in the crystallinity from 1.2 % to 7.7% over 24 153 \nhrs (Supplementary Information Fig. 10). Atomic Force Microscopy (Fig. 3c) as well as Scanning 154 \nElectron Microscopy (Supplementary Information  Fig. 1 1) further showed  that the reaction 155 \nprogression of FAST-PETase as it produced increasingly deeper and larger holes in the pc-PET surface 156 \nresulting in increased surface roughness (and visible opaqueness) over reaction time (Supplementary 157 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In contrast, t he PET-hydrolytic activity of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, 158 \nDuraPETase, LCC and ICCM toward this pc-PET was substantially lower (3.2 to 141.6-fold) than that 159 \nof FAST-PETase under the same conditions (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, even at their previously reported 160 \noptimal reaction temperature of 72 \u2070C 4, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still 4.9-fold and 1.5-fold 161 \nlower than that of FAST-PETase at 50 \u2070C. Further experimental analysis (Supplementary Information 162 \nFig. 13) indicated that LCC and ICCM exhibited the ir highest degradation rate against this pc -PET 163 \nfilm at 60 \u2070C. However, even at 60\u2070C, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still lower than that of FAST-164 \nPETase at 50 \u2070C. Moreover, we demonstrate that the depolymerization process with FAST-PETase is 165 \neasily scalable to large, untreated pieces of plastic (in this case, 6.4 g rather than 11 mg) simply by 166 \nincreasing net reaction volumes (Fig. 3d). Given these results, FAST-PETase can serve as a promising 167 \nbiocatalyst for the enzyme-based platform aimed at recycling raw, untreated PET waste , with  168 \nadvantages of lower operating cost and higher degradation efficiency of pc-PET, in contrast to ICCM 169 \nthat requires a higher reaction temperature.  170 \nBeyond packaging materials, PET is used heavily in the synthetic textile industry. To this end, 171 \nwe evaluated the potential application of FAST-PETase to partially degrade commercial polyester 172 \nproducts. Five different commercial polyester products were treated with FAST-PETase at 50  \u2070C, 173 \nreleasing higher amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET) 174 \nrelative to that of the samples treated with other PHEs (Fig. 3e). This indicates that FAST-PETase can 175 \npotentially be used for rapid and efficient degradation of the PET fragments embedded in textile fabrics, 176 \nproviding a potential route for recovering PET monomers from commercial polyester products and 177 \nreducing the leaching of microfibers into the environment. 178 \nGiven the high activity of this FAST-PETase mutant at ambient temperatures and pH 179 \nconditions, we hypothesized that this enzyme would be suitable for various enzymatic -microbial and 180 \nenzymatic-chemical processing of PET. In this regard, PET depolymerization is only half of the 181 \ncircular plastic economy and we demonstrate here the compatibility of FAST-PETase with both 182 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

First, we demonstrate a 183 \nclosed-cycle PET re-constitution by first depolymerizing a tinted post-consumer plastic waste utilizing 184 \nFAST-PETase and subsequently recovering monome rs. TPA was recovered from the degradation 185 \nsolution with a yield of 96.8% and with a purity of over 99%. We then regenerate virgin PET directly 186 \nfrom the degradation solution  using chemical polymerization  (Fig. 4a ). A complete cycle of 187 \ndegradation to re -polymerization can be accomplished in as little as a few days  (Supplementary 188 \nInformation Fig. 14). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a closed -loop enzymatic/chemical 189 \nrecycling process to generate a clear, virgin PET film from non-petroleum resources. Moreover, this 190 \nworkflow bypasses the challenges of recycling mixed-color PET products. 191 \nSecond, we sought to utilize the degradation capability of FAST-PETase at ambient 192 \ntemperature to enable direct depolymerization and microbial valorization of monomers. To this end, 193 \nwe evaluated a simultaneous biodegradation  scheme using FAST-PETase to demonstrate that this 194 \nmutant enzyme is microbe -compatible. In particular, a soil bacteria Pseudomonas putida Go1920,21 195 \ncapable of naturally utilizing TPA as a carbon and energy sour ce and capable of producing 196 \npolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was employed . Initially, we sought to combine exogenous FAST-197 \nPETase with this host to explore the possibility of simultaneous PET depolymerization and 198 \nfermentation. P. putida  Go19 was inoculated into a minimal medium supplemented with an 199 \nunpretreated pc-PET film absent of any other carbon source. Upon adding 200 nM of purified FAST-200 \nPETase to the culture medium, growth of P. putida Go19 was observed concomitant with the degraded 201 \npc-PET film which displayed opacity and lost 20.2 \u00b1 2.1% of its initial weight (Fig. 4b) after 4 days. 202 \nThrough this experiment, we observed t hat the TPA liberated from the hydrolysis of pc -PET film by 203 \nFAST-PETase was consumed by the P. putida Go19 for growth (Fig. 4b) and PHAs accumulation (Fig. 204 \n4c). In contrast, when wild -type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase , LCC, or ICCM was used as 205 \nthe catalyst in such process, the cell density of P. putida Go 19 and the weight loss of the pc-PET film 206 \nwere all significantly lower than when FAST-PETase was used (Fig. 4b). These results demonstrated 207 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This demonstration represents the first 209 \nsimultaneous bioprocess that integrates enzymatic PET depolymerization and TPA conversion to  210 \nPHAs at ambient temperatures and neutral pH. 211 \n              In conclusion, this work utilized a structure-based deep learning model  to identify portable 212 \nsubstitutions that imparted improved stability and function across a variety of PETase scaffolds. The 213 \nbest variant, FAST-PETase, exhibits superior activity over a wide range of temperatures (30\u201350 \u2070C), 214 \nand exceptional compatibility with cell-growth conditions. We demonstrate this capacity via the rapid, 215 \nefficient, and complete degradation of bulk, untreated pc-PET waste and a reduction of PET fragments 216 \nembedded in textile fabrics. The properties of this variant are ultimately suitable for both low -cost 217 \nindustrial recycling as well as  for in situ plastic degradation applications, as demonstrate d by 218 \nsimultaneous bioprocessing with P. putida Go 19. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential 219 \nfor structure-based deep learning in protein engineering and the opportunities for converting 220 \nmesophilic enzyme scaffolds into broad-range biocatalysts for a cyclic plastic economy.   221 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The feature extraction block consisted of six layers: 371 \ntwo pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by a dimension reduction max pooling layer after each 372 \npair. The first pair of convolutional layers used filters of size 3x3x3 and the second pair had filters of 373 \nsize 2x2x2. Additionally, the Rectified Linearity Unit function (Relu) was applied to the output of each 374 \nof the four convolutional layers. The final feature maps generated by t he feature extraction block had 375 \ndimensions of size 400x3x3x3. These feature maps were flattened into a 1D vector of size 10,800 376 \nbefore being passed to the classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully 377 \nconnected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2, and 0, respectively. Like the feature extraction 378 \nblock, the output of the first two dense layers was transformed by the Relu function. To obtain a vector 379 \nof 20 probability scores representing the network prediction for each of the amino acids, we applied a 380 \nsoftmax activation function to the output of the third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a 381 \nmachine learning as a service (MLaaS) on https://mutcompute.com.  382 \nMutCompute Predictions: 383 \nMutCompute predictions were obtained by running the wild type PETase (pdb id: 5xjh) and 384 \nthermopetase (pdb id: 6ij6) through our MLaaS at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered by 385 \nsorting by the probability assigned to the wild type amino acid. We filtered 34  and 39 residues from 386 \nthe wild type PETase and Thermopetase crystal structures, respectively. From these filtered residues, 387 \nwe prioritized our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the 10 residues from each crystal structure 388 \nwith the highest log2 fold chan ge between the predicted amino acid and wild type amino acid 389 \nprobabilities. Prior to experimentation, selected residues were visualized with Mutcompute -View, 390 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The 400 \ninitial hits were identified with the rod -shaped crystals formed after incubating screening plates at 401 \n25 \u00b0C for three days. The crystallization was optimized as 0.1 M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M Ammonium Sulfate, 402 \npH 5.5 setup as sitting-drop vapor diffusion.  403 \n 404 \nIndividual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotected with 405 \n30 % (v/v) glycerol. X -ray diffraction data were  collected at 23 -ID-B beamline in Advance Photon 406 \nSource (Lemont, IL). The X -ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44\u00c5 resolution for FAST -407 \nPETase crystals using HKL2000 22. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with 408 \nThermoPETase structure as the initial search model (PDB code 6IJ6 12). The molecular replacement 409 \nsolution for FAST -PETase structure was iteratively buil t and refined using Coot 23 and Phenix 24 410 \nrefinement package. Procheck and MolProbity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST -PETase 411 \nstructure.

Creating a 703 \nmicroenvironment: MutCompute begins by centering itself on the alpha carbon of a particular residue 704 \nin the protein and filters all peptide atoms within a 20 angstrom cube (the orientation of the cube is 705 \nnormalized with respect to the protein backbone). In the filtering process, we create an artificial, self-706 \nsupervised label by excluding all atoms that belong the center residue. b. Encoding the 707 \nmicroenvironment: The filtered atoms are then encoded into a 7-channel voxelated representation with 708 \na voxel resolution of 1A3.  c. Running MutCompute on a Microenvironment: The 7-channel voxelated 709 \nrepresentation of a microenvironment is then passed to the CNN model, MutCompute. The model can 710 \nbe broken into 2 parts: Feature extraction and classification. The feature extraction portion c onsist of 711 \nconvolutional and max pooling layers and is then flattened into a 1D-vector before being passed to the 712 \nclassification layers of the model. The output is a probability mass function of the likelihood each of 713 \nthe 20 amino acids was the amino acid in the center of the microenvironment. We do this process for 714 \nevery residue in the protein to identify residues for mutagenesis. 715 \n 716 \nSupplementary Information Fig. 2 | Disfavored PETase residues flagged by MutCompute from 717 \nthe wild -type and ThermoPETase crystal  structures. MutCompute outputs a probability 718 \ndistribution that describes the likelihood of each of the 20 canonical amino acids to be the wild -type 719 \namino acid for the surrounding chemical environment. A disfavored residue is defined as a residue 720 \nwhere the amino acid with the highest predicted probability is not the wild -type amino acid. Here, a 721 \n30% wild-type probability cutoff was used to down select disfavored residues.  722 \n 723 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.
