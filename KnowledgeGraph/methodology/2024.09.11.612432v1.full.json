As\nexpected, most of the RMSF profile overlapped between the wild typeIsPETase and S269T\nmutant simulations, with the exception of the following regions: the loops formed by residues\n88 to 91 (unpaired t-test, BH adj. p-value = 0.0264), residue 112 to 115 (unpaired t-test, BH\nadj. p-value = 0.0287) and residue 238 to 241 (unpaired t-test, BH adj. p-value=0.0102). The\nregion formed by residues 88 to 91 is both close to the active site and is involved in the\nformation of the active cleft where the substrate binds and has been shown to be a key\ndifference betweenIsPETaseand other membersofthe\u03b1/\u03b2-foldhydrolases 53 (Fig.3b).\n8\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The node edges indicate the detected paths, with width proportional to the\nfrequency of the connection appearing in the top 10 paths.\nGiven the high sequence similarity between IsPETase and FastPETase, particularly the\nidentical residues from 88 to 91 in bothenzymes,we hypothesisedthattheS269Tmutationin\nFastPETase might act through the same mechanism and produce similar effects asobserved\nin IsPETase. To investigate this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both\nFastPETase and its mutantFast_2.9,eachlasting1 \u00b5swithfivereplicates.The simulationsfor\nboth enzymes were prepared and analysed using the same methodology applied to the\nIsPETase simulations, with the sole difference beingtheir optimal temperature(Methods).The\nper residue weighted RMSF profiles of FastPETase and Fast_S269T displayed the same\nstabilising behaviour as the one observed for IsPETase (unpaired t-test, BH adj.\np-value=0.0161) (Fig.3c).\nTo corroborate if the lower fluctuations observed in the region of residues 88 to 91 for the\nS269T mutants are due to a stabilisation of the crystallographic orientation or due to a new\nconformation, the RootMeanSquareDeviation(RMSD) ofthebackboneatomsofresidues88\nto 91 was analysed. To properly capture different conformations with respect to the crystal\nstructure and not merely internal orientations of the loop, we aligned all simulation frames to\nthe crystal structure using the C-alpha carbons of all residues except for 88 to 91. Following\nthis alignment, we computed the RMSD for the backbone of residues 88 to 91 without\nadditional realignment. We then generated a probabilitydensitydistributionbycombiningdata\nfrom all replicates. For bothIsPETase and FastPETase, the S269T mutants showed a higher\npreference for conformations resembling thecrystallographicstructure,suggestingthatS269T\nmutantactsbystabilisingthisconformation(Fig.3d).\nWe then aligned the previously reported structure ofIsPETase with a hydroxyethyl-capped\nPET dimer docked53,54 witharepresentativestructureofthe loopconformationsdisplayinglow\ndeviations with the crystallographic pose (Fig. 3d, RMSD\u22431.5 \u00c5) and a representative\nstructure of the loop conformations with a high deviations (Fig. 3d, RMSD\u22435 \u00c5).

Although we did not find any direct evidence indicating the correlation between S269\nand DS2, instead we found that the DS2 could possibly be partially reduced (Supplementary\nFigs. 6b, 7, 8), and the absence of DS2 did not significantlyaffecttheactivityofIsPETase but\ncaused almost complete loss of activity in FastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 6c).Weinfer that\nin the WTIsPETase,theDS2islikelytoplayaregulatoryrather thanstructural roleandfurther\nstudieswill beneededtoclarifyfunctions(See also inSupplementarynote).\nTo get insights how the effect from S269T mutation may be traversing to ~28 \u00c5 away active\nsite, we analysed the shortest residue C-alpha fluctuation correlation paths connecting\nmutation to the residues of the active cleft using Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal\nPaths (WISP) method55. As suggested by WISP analysis (Methods), the effect of mutation\nseems to propagate from the \u03b17 helix to the \u03b11 helix, then to the \u03b12 helix and finally to the\nactive cleft most commonly involving residues THR88, ALA89, SER93, ILE94 and TRP97\n(blueresiduesinFig.3g).\nS269T enhances enzymatic activity across known PETases\nAs suggested by molecular dynamics analysis, we introduced the S269T mutation to\nFastPETase, an enzyme that is known to be active at higher temperatures18, to assess its\neffect on PETase activity. The mutated Fast_S269T variant showed enhanced catalytic\nefficiency across a pH range of 6-10, notably doubling its performance at pH 8 compared to\nFastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 9). Analogously, we applied the same S269T mutation to\nother IsPETase variants, i.e., ThermoPETase, HotPETase and DepoPETase, to see if this\nmutation exhibited universal effects (Fig. 4a). Similarly as with FastPETase, catalytic\nenhancements were observed in ThermoPETase across 30, 40 and 50\u2103 in pH 8 and 9\nconditions. For HotPETase and DepoPETase, significant increases were only observed for its\nS269T variant at 50 \u00b0C pH 9 conditions (Welch's t-test, p-value=0.00324 for HotPETase and\np-value=0.0295 for DepoPETase), which possibly could be attributed to the structural\ndifferencesofHotPETaseand DepoPETase,whichcontain21 20 and721 mutationsrespectively,\ncompared toIsPETase. The highest effects are observed in FastPETaseoverall showingover\n430-fold increase of activity compared to wild typeIsPETase performance at 50\u2103and we\nnamed thisenzyme Fast_2.9 (Fig.4a).\nTo access Fast_2.9 performance, we included LCCICCG, a highly efficient enzyme tested in\nindustrial scales56. Since FastPETase and Fast_2.9 loses activity at 60\u00b0C (data not shown),\nwe compared monomer production after 48h at temperatures 30, 40 and 50\u00b0C and pH levels\nof 8 or 9, revealing that Fast_2.9 is most effective at milder temperatures of 50 \u00b0C and pH 8,\nwhere it released 2.01 and 2.79 times more monomer FastPETase and LCCICCG, respectively\n(Fig. 4a). Given these results, Fast_2.9 shows promise as a candidate for large-scale\napplications, especially at temperatures around 50\u00b0C,aligningwell withthethermal properties\nof polymer, as isothermal crystallisation could possibly occur when the temperature is above\n10\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

To investigate the effects of degradation rates in detail, we compared\nFast_2.9, FastPETase and LCCICCG kinetics using the inverse Michaelis\u2013Menten approach14\nusing a range of enzyme concentrations. For all experiments, we used a unprocessed\npost-consumer PET substrate at 12 g/L across all conditions (Methods), with enzyme\nconcentrations ranging from 5 nM to 700 nM (equivalent to 0.01 to 1.66 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131),\nmeasuredover thefirst7 hata constanttemperatureof50 \u00b0CandapHof8.\n11\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Therefore we also evaluated how Fast_2.9 could degrade untreated\ncoloured opaque postconsumer PET containers with just 0.72 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131 of enzyme\nusage. Under identical conditions, 97.6% of PET was degraded within 66 hours leaving only\nthe green pigment in the reaction container (Fig. 4e, 4f, Supplementary Video) demonstrating\nFast_2.9suitabilityfor TPArecoveryfromnon-transparentPETwaste.\nApproximately 60% of the PET produced is usedinthetextileindustry,while~30%isusedin\nthePETbottleindustry 64.Andthereexistnomaturerecyclingsystemfor textilewasteglobally,\n87% of whichendsin incinerationor landfills65.Toexplorethe broader applicationofFast_2.9,\nwe pretreated 3 types of polyester textiles with extruding, quenching and grinding (Fig. 4g),\nand then incubated with Fast_2.9. By the end of 72 hours ofincubation,thedepolymerisation\nrate reached77.2\u00b11.6%,77.4\u00b11.1%and75.1 \u00b11.8%respectively,whichisalsoclose tothe\nsubstrate weight loss of 79.7 \u00b1 4.0%\uff0c81.8 \u00b1 2.8% and 85.9 \u00b1 4.0%, as measured by\nlyophilization weight loss (Fig. 4h).

We engineered the strain using a biosensor\nthat is TPA specific35 and transformed PET into nanoparticles to allow directly to sense PET\ndegradationwithoutrelyingonalternativesubstratesthatarenotrelatedtodepolymerisationof\nPET16. Through screening a million-sized libraryatmesophilic30\u00b0Ctemperature,we identified\neight mutants that enhancedIsPETaseactivity,with the mostnotableincrease,a22-fold effect\n(Fig. 2f), observed with the single S269T mutation located on the \u03b17helix,thatisdistantfrom\nthe active site(Fig.3a).WeintroducedtheS269TmutationintoknownPETasesand observed\na general trendofactivation,mostpronouncedinFastPETase(Fig.4a).Theresultingenzyme,\nFast_2.9, achieved a 430-fold increase in activity over the wild type at 50\u00b0C using untreated\npost-consumer substrate(Fig 4a).\nTo explore the underlying mechanisms, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics\nsimulations as distal mutations might influence protein structure and dynamics through\nlong-range effects, potentially leading to allosteric impacts on enzymatic catalysis 66\u201369.\nMolecular trajectory analysis revealed that the ~28\u00c5 distance is mediated by interactions\ninvolving residues that connect to the \u03b23-\u03b12 loop,stabilising residuesY87,T88,and A89(Fig.\n3c, 3g). Notably, Austin et al53 found that the substrate binding cleft ofIsPETaseincludesT88\nand S238, while Guo and colleagues70 demonstrated that T88 and A89 are crucial for\ninteracting with the PET polymer, such that mutations Y87H, Y87E, T88H,andA89Hresulted\nin a significant loss of activity, underscoring the critical roles these residues play in enzyme\nfunction. Similar to IsPETase and M2.9, we found the same global change pattern for\nFastPETaseandFast_2.9(Fig.3c,3d,3e,3f).\n14\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

In fact, Arnal et al testedtheenzymevariantLCCICCG,avariantknownfor its\nhigh efficiencyinindustrial applications,atalower temperatureof68\u00b0Cinsteadof72\u00b0C,taking\ninto account the thermal properties of PET56. Our results show that Fast_2.9 has higher\nactivities thanFastPETaseat30-50 \u2103(Fig.4a,4b) andindifferentpH(SupplementaryFig.9),\nalso outperforming LCCICCG in temperature ranges 30-50\u2103(Fig. 4b), and thus aligning well\nwith the thermal properties of PET and making overall favourable process economy in\nmesophilictemperatures.\nInverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis of the three enzymes with 12 g/L postconsumer\nPET plastics showed that Fast_2.9 has the lowestInvKm, which could be attributed to the\nsubstrate binding cleft stabilisation by S269T for better substrate binding(Fig.3).LowerInvKm\nmeans lower enzyme usage, lowering costs of enzymaticcatalysis,whereasthelowaffinityof\nLCCICCG, as previously suggested,could potentiallylimititswideindustrial adoption75.Assuch,\nwe showed that as little 0.72 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131ofFast_2.9isneededfor nearly100%conversion\ninto TPA of multiple postconsumer PET (both transparent and coloured opaque products)\nwithin just 48hours,which is28%lessenzymeamountthantheoptimised 1mg enzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131for\nLCCICCG 56 and 64% less than the recently reported 2 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131 for TurboPETase14.\nMinimising enzyme usage in this process plays a critical role in enhancing the transformation\nof PET waste into high-value products, thereby contributing to the overall valueenhancement\nof this recycling pathway. High conversion rate from raw PET to TPA rather than MHET is\nneeded to achieve the circular biorecycling and is preferable to be done by a single enzyme.\nHere we showed the potential of Fast_2.9 acting as MHETase76 and achieved 95.9% TPA\ncontent in the total monomers. Similar function has been observed in the variant\nIsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A 77,however theexactcontentvaluewasnotreported. Furthermore,in all\nour experiments except for textile degradation, we used post-consumer PET from\ncustomer-used bottles and containers directly, without any pre-treatments such as heating,\ngrinding 18, acid and base treatments 7879, which underscores the application potential of\nFast_2.9. In this study, secondhand polyester textiles were the only material subjected to\npretreatment. These textiles typically exhibit higher crystallinity and contain more additives\ncompared to food-grade bottles or containers. Initial attempts to directly degrade the raw\ntextile using Fast_2.9 showed limited efficiency (datanotshown).However,byincorporatinga\npretreatment step followed by enzymatic degradation at 50\u00b0C, we demonstrated the\neffectiveness of Fast_2.9 in recycling textile waste. This method achieved over 77%\ndepolymerization and 74.4-90% end-to-end TPA production, highlighting its potential for\nsustainabletextilewastemanagement.\nThe resulting high activity, low substrate-enzyme ratio of Fast_2.9 and effectiveness at mild\n30-50\u2103 temperatures makes it a suitable candidate for industrial PET depolymerisation. In\nPET enzymatic processing, a higher concentration of TPA is advantageous because an\nadditional hydrolysis step is normally needed to completely convert MHET into TPA either by\nenzymatic 80 or chemical hydrolysis18. TPA can be used as a fundamental building block for\nsynthesising recycled virgin-like PET4 as well as for upscaled novel applications7,81.

Furthermore, S269 and its derived mutants can be further enhanced through\niterativecyclesofour presented droplet-basedenzymeevolutionwithsubstratenano-particles.\nOverall, we foresee this technology as a general method that can beappliedfor developing a\nbroad range of biocatalysts acting on water insoluble solid substrates including other\nenvironment polluting plastic polymers 82. Accelerated enzyme evolution has once again\ntransformed previously challenging enzymes, now, into potential drivers of the plastic circular\neconomy.\nMethods\nGenomic integration of TPA biosensor inE.coli\nThe TPA biosensor module (Supplementary Table 1) was synthesised, cloned into pTwist\nChlor Medium copy number plasmid by TWIST Bioscience (www.twistbioscience.com) and\nnamed pTPAsensor. Four plasmids (pDonor, pTnsABC, pQcascade-array1 and pCutamp) for\nmulticopy chromosomal integration using CRISPR-associated transposases (MUCICAT) were\npurchased from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org). The pDonor-TPAsensor plasmid was\nconstructed by inserting the TPA biosensor module into the pDonor plasmid. The TPA\nbiosensor biomodule was amplified using the primer pair TPA sensor_pDonor_F and TPA\nsensor_pDonor_R (Supplementary Table 6) and gel-purified with GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit\n(Cat#K0691, Thermo Scientific). The purified PCR product was ligated into the linearized\npDonor plasmid using Gibson assembly 83, following BamHI and XbaI digestion. The\npDonor-TPAsensor plasmid was sequence-verified by Eurofins Genomics\n(https://eurofinsgenomics.eu/) using the primer pair pDonor_seq_F and pDonor_seq_R after\ncolonyPCR.\nBL21(DE3) competent cells were co-transformed with pDonor-TPAsensor and pTnsABC\nplasmids. After a 1-hour recovery incubation, the transformed cells were plated on LB-agar\nplates containing 100 \u03bcg/mLampicillinand50\u03bcg/mLkanamycin.TherecombinantBL21(DE3)\nstrain carrying pDonor-TPAsensor and pTnsABS was made chemically competent using the\nHanahan Method84 and then transformed with pQCascade-array1 plasmid. These cells were\nplated on LB-agar containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin, 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin, and 50 \u03bcg/mL\nstreptomycin,andincubatedat37\u00b0Cfor 16hours,leadingtocolonygrowth.\nThese colonies were scraped, suspended in fresh LB medium, and a 100 \u03bcl aliquot was\nre-plated on LB-agar plates containing the triple antibiotic combination and 0.1 mM IPTG to\ninduce transposition-related protein expression and biofilm formation. The plates were\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 16 hours. After biofilm formation, the biofilms were\nscraped off, resuspended in LB medium, diluted, and plated on LB-agar with the triple\nantibiotic combination and 1 mM IPTG. These inducing plates were incubated overnightat37\n\u00b0C.\nTo enhance clonal outgrowth andintegrationefficiency,coloniesfromtheinducingplateswere\ndesignated as Transfer 1. A subset of these colonies was streaked onto fresh LB-agar plates\nwith the triple antibiotics and 1 mM IPTG, then incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C, resulting in\nTransfer 2. Further transfers led to Transfer 3. Copy numbers were identified using colony\nPCR or qPCRwith8primer pairs(cr1-cr8,SupplementaryTable6) targetingthegenomicsites\nintegratedbypQCascade-array1.\n16\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.
