    "2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS\n2.1 | Molecular docking\nConsidering that the binding mode of PET in theIsPETase structure\nwas not previously elucidated using experimental methods, we per-\nformed molecular docking of an oligomer consisting of four monomers\nin their low free-energy conformations to analyze the selectivity and\naffinity of the polymer during the initial stages of the PETase catalytic\nprocess. Considering the wild-type structure ofI. sakaiensis PETase\n(PDB: 6EQE, X-ray diffraction with 0.92 \u00c5 resolution) was the first\nreported mesophilic enzyme with affinity and catalytic activity against\nthe PET,\n24 we choose this structure with high resolution as a target to\nperform a detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions established\nbetween the protein and the PET.\nTo perform the molecular docking against theIsPETase binding\nsubsites, we used the AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2)33 program with\nthe following forms mimicking PET: monomer (bis-[hydroxyethyl] tere-\nphthalate, BHET), dimer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-hydroxyethyl tere-\nphthalate)\n2, 2-HE(MHET) 2), and tetramer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-\nhydroxyethyl terephthalate)4, 2-HE(MHET)2).13 Conjecturing that the\nconformation of the PET tetramer in theIsPETase corresponds to that\nof individual monomers bound atIsPETase subsites I to IV, we sequen-\ntially constructed three models of PET: Model I comprises the individual\nPET monomers against four proposed binding subsites of PETase. In\nModel II, we combined two PET monomers, thus forming a dimer to\ndock against two adjacentIsPETase binding subsites. In Model III, we\njoined the four PET monomers forming a tetramer to dock against four\npotential adjacent PETase binding subsites (subsites I to IV). Table S1\nshows the parameters used in the docking of the three models of PET.\nThe molecular docking in the AutoDock Vina was performed con-\nsidering the flexibility of the residues from the subsites (Tyr87,\nTrp159, Ser160, Met161, Ile208, Asn233, His 237, Ser238, Asn241,\nand Arg280), as well as the flexibility of the ligand. The following Car-\ntesian coordinates of the center of the docking grid, in \u00c5, were\napplied: X = /C0 0.51, Y = 4.23, and Z = 20.09; with dimensions of\nx = 70, y = 56, andz = 68 for PET flexible docking.\nFurther validation was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker\n(MVD)\n34 and CSD-GOLD35; then compared with the conformations\nobtained by the AutoDock Vina (available in Tables S1 and S3). After\nanalysis and validation, the top-predicted pose of theIsPETase-PET\ncomplex obtained from AutoDock Vina was used as the starting point\nfor the MD simulations.\n2.2 | Molecular dynamics simulations\nTo evaluate the conformational dynamics of theIsPETase, we performed\nMD simulations in the Amber16 package36 with structures derived from\nthe docking study. The structure ofIsPETase has two disulfide bonds\n(203-239 and 273-289) that play an important role in maintaining and\nstabilizing the protein structure. We performed MD simulations for two\nIsPETase systems: IsPETase in the unbound state (system I); and\nIsPETase in complex with PET tetramer (2-HE(MHET)\n4) (system II). The\nsimulation of polymers may be particularly difficult.37,38 Therefore, to\nobtain a satisfactory sampling of the PETase in the bound state, we\napplied restraint forces. This approach has been useful to identify domain\nmotions especially for those of computational challenging systems.39,40\nFirst, the protein residues were parameterized with the ff99SB\nforce field.41 The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) protocol\n1342 DA COSTA ET AL.\n 10970134, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26155 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2025].

The charges were then obtained\nusing the antechamber module available in the Amber16 package. To\ndescribe PET structure complexed with IsPETase, the ligand was\nparameterized with the general Amber force field and the receptor\n(IsPETase enzyme) was parameterized with Amber ff99SB forcefield.\nBoth systems were solvated in an octahedral periodic box of 12 \u00c5\nside, with the TIP3P water solvation model.\n43 The systems were neu-\ntralized with Cl/C0 ions to avoid unbalanced charges.

We started the minimization with a constraint\nforce equal to 500 kcal/mol/\u00c5\n2 applied in the cartesian coordinates,\nwhich was gradually decreased during minimization to relax the\nwaters, counterions, protein, and ligand structure. Afterward, the sys-\ntems were heated in 10 steps from 0 to 300 K. The first heating step\nwas maintained at constant volume during 20 ps (0 to 100 K), from\nthe second to the ninth step the temperature was gradually increased\nfrom 25 to 25 K until reaching 275 K with each step performed in a\ntime of 1 ns for each step, and in the 10th step (last heating step) the\nsystem reached the temperature of 300 K. Then, we performed 5 ns\nof MD simulation to balance the density of the system and maintain a\nconstant pressure (1 bar) and temperature (300 K). Here, we\nmaintained the PET tetramer interacting with theIsPETase binding\nsites (I to IV) using a restraint force of 150 kcal/mol/\u00c5\n2 on the Carte-\nsian coordinates of PET obtained from molecular docking. The SHAKE\nalgorithm was applied for all hydrogen bonds in the analyzed systems.\nIt is worth noting that restraint forces in the ligand structures in com-\nplex with the molecular receptor are widely applied to allow the con-\nformational adaptation of the receptor structure to the ligands, thus,\nestablishing favorable intermolecular interaction.\n44,45 It is important\nto highlight that the restraints force also increases the conformational\nstability of the complex throughout the MD simulation, avoiding the\nloss of the interaction between the investigated structures, and misin-\nterpretation of the binding free energy values.\n46,47\nIn the production stage of the unbound and bound systems (sys-\ntems I and II, respectively), we performed 500 ns of MD simulations\nfor each system using the NPT ensemble, and each system was repli-\ncated and assigned with different initial velocities to generate inde-\npendent simulations.\n2.3 | Principal component analysis and free energy\nlandscape\nThe principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that allows to\nreduce the dimensions of the analyzed trajectories during the MD\nsimulation of the covariance matrix (C), thus reducing the linear corre-\nlations between the spatial coordinates and converting them into a\nset of an orthogonal vector named principal component (PC) which\ndescribes the movements using the Cartesian coordinatesX, Y, and\nZ of each analyzed atom.\n48 This technique has been widely combined\nwith MD simulations to evaluate the conformational changes of pro-\ntein structures.40,49-55 Here, the CPPTRAJ module available in the\nAmber16 package was used to obtain the trajectories ofIsPETase\nstructures using the C\u03b1 coordinates over the 500 ns of MDs to gener-\nate the principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3).

    "molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to analyze structural changes of\nIsPETase induced by PET binding. Results from the essential dynamics revealed that\nthe \u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loop is very flexible. This loop is located far from the active site\nof IsPETase and we suggest that it can be considered for mutagenesis to increase the\nthermal stability ofIsPETase. The free energy landscape (FEL) demonstrates that the\nmain change in the transition between the unbound to the bound state is associated\nwith the\u03b27-\u03b15 connecting loop, where the catalytic residue Asp206 is located.

    "simulation, where the highlighted region indicates the PET binding\ncavity (Figure 3A). The main residues for each subsite obtained by our\ndocking results are shown in Figure 3B. TheIsPETase subsites I-IV are\nproposed to accommodate four MHET moieties of the PET in an L-\nshape (Figure 3B,C). The complex was stabilized mainly by hydropho-\nbic interactions. Hydrogen bond interactions with Ser236 and Asn246\nwere observed at the ester linkages between the MHET moieties. The\nresidue Arg280 also participated in the interaction at subsite IV\n(Figure 3C), although it is demonstrated that its absence showed much\ngreater PET degradation activity.\n14 Intermolecular distances between\nthe atoms of the catalytic pocket and PET structure obtained from the\nmolecular docking could be seen in Table S4.\nThe obtained binding modes (Figure 2C) demonstrated that the\nPET tends to fill the same spatial regions of the subsites as a mono-\nmer, dimer, or tetramer. Therefore, ourIsPETase-PET complex repre-\nsents a consistent and reliable model with favorable binding energies.\nThe pocket mapping was compared with the docking results obtained\nfrom MVD\n34 and GOLD35 programs to validate our conformational\nsearch (see more in Table S2).\nPreviously, Fecker et al demonstrated thatIsPETase has a binding\nmode similar to other PET-degrading cutinases, such as Cut2 obtained\nfrom Thermobifida fusca KW3 (TfCut2) and leaf-branch compost\ncutinase (LCC) obtained from a metagenomic survey.\n15 These authors\nexplored the cutinases-PET complexes focusing only on the active site\nthat contains the catalytic triad formed by the residues Asp179,\nHis210, and Ser133.\n15 The comparison between IsPETase and\ncutinases TfCut2 and LCC demonstrated that the catalytic triad is con-\nserved, showing the same spatial orientation in the three structures.\nInterestingly, the residues Asp179 and His210; and Ser133 and\nHis210 formed hydrogen bond interactions in the active site. Our\ndocking and MD simulations also demonstrated a very similar spatial\norientation for these residues (Asp206, His237, and Ser160,\nrespectively).\nIn contrast, Joo et al, investigated the interaction of four-MHET\nmolecules mimicking the PET structure against fourIsPETase binding\npockets named subsite I, IIa, IIb, and IIc.\n13 According to their docking\n1344 DA COSTA ET AL.\n 10970134, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26155 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2025].

It was also dem-\nonstrated that Arg280 at the end of subsite IIc, due to its protruding\nshape, hinders stable interaction of IsPETase with PET substrate\nbeyond the fourth moiety, and its substitution into a small hydropho-\nbic residue might allow more stable binding for a longer substrate.\nSimilarly, Austin et al used docking simulations to predict the PET\nbinding mode in theIsPETase and demonstrated that PET formed an\ninteraction with the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Ser160 (/C24 5.1 \u00c5)\nand the His237 is positioned within 3.9 \u00c5 of the Ser160 hydroxyl.\n24\nThe interatomic distances obtained from our simulations are consis-\ntent with this previous proposal and also with the previous results\nreported by Fecker et al and Joo et al.\n3.1 | Analysis of molecular dynamics ofIsPETase\nOur model of the IsPETase-PET complex started with a consistent\nbinding mode as previously proposed in docking studies.13,24 In the\npresent study, we used MD simulations to explore the conformational\nchange of IsPETase upon PET binding. The RMSD plots of the\nIsPETase structure in the unbound and bound states are shown in\nFigure S3. Our MD simulations protocol successfully sampled the\ndifficult-to-access configurations of theIsPETase structure in complex\nwith PET, showing high stability during the MD simulation, with devia-\ntions below 3.0 \u00c5 (Figure S3A). In general, theIsPETase in both bound\nand unbound states showed no significant atomic RMSD deviation\nover the MD trajectory, exhibiting RMSD values of 1.93 \u00b1 0.43 \u00c5 and\n1.56 \u00b1 0.35 \u00c5, respectively (Figure S3B and Table S5). Thus, further\nanalysis to better describes the differences between the unbound and\nbound systems was carried out using more detailed analysis.\nThe analysis of the binding mode of PET complexed with PETase\nshowed that the Trp159 from the subsite II formed a\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking\ninteraction with the aromatic ring from the MHET moiety (see\nFigure S1). Furthermore, the Ile209 formed a\u03c0-alkyl interaction with\nthe same structural moiety of PET located at the subsite II. Regarding\nsubsite I, we noted that residue Trp186 (NE1) formed H-bond interac-\ntions with the oxygen atoms of the MHET moiety (O11, O13, and\nO14). We conjecture that these interactions are responsible to main-\ntain the PET in subsite I and II over the MD trajectory. Differently, the\nsubsites III and IV, the structural moieties of PET formed numerous\nhydrophobic contacts that weakly maintain the PET structure in the\npocket. Thus, its structure suffers considerable conformational\nFIGURE 3 Binding mode of PET complexed withIsPETase and the molecular interactions obtained by the molecular docking simulations.

Figure S4 shows an\noverview of each MHET moieties (hexagons) complexed at their\nrespective binding subsite during MD simulations.\nMonomer 2 showed the most stable interactions in the elected\nbinding subsites (system II, Figure S4). In contrast, the monomers\nlocated at the ends of the PET polymer (monomers 1 and 4) showed\nhigher mobility. The RMSD plot also showed that the use of a\nrestraint force to maintain the PET in the binding subsite allowed pro-\ntein adjustments for a better fit during the first frames of the MD tra-\njectory. When the restraint force was reduced, the PET conformation\nwas gradually adjusted and remained in the subsite until the end of\nthe 500 ns of simulation.\nWe also analyzed the root-mean-square fluctuation (RSMF) for\nindividual amino acid residue over the 500 ns of MD simulation. This\nanalysis was used as a criterion for quantifying the flexibility of\nIsPETase, where higher RMSF values correspond to more flexible\nregions of the protein during MD simulation. The RMSF shows that\nthe catalytic residues Asp206 and His237 located at\u03b27-\u03b15 and\u03b28-\u03b16\nconnecting loop, respectively, presented considerable mobility during\nMD simulations. It is interesting to note that previously, Fecker et al\nanalyzed the conformational changes ofIsPETase over time, as well as\nthe interactions of PET at the subsites; and they found that the\u03b27-\u03b15\nloop (loop10) flexibility was larger in IsPETase than in its close\ncutinase homologs.\n15\n3.2 | Essential dynamics ofIsPETase\nThe use ofIsPETase for PET degradation is limited due to its low ther-\nmal stability. Thus, we have used essential dynamics to identify the\nflexible regions in the protein structure. These flexible regions in the\nIsPETase can be used as a potential target for enhancing thermal sta-\nbility. Besides, this analysis can also provide insight into the induced-\nsubstrate conformational change inIsPETase. Herein, we performed a\nPCA for the two analyzed systems: (a) PETase in the unbound state\n(ligand-free), and (b)IsPETase in the bound state.\nCorroborating with PCA results, the residue Trp185 showed a\nconsiderable fluctuation between unbound and bound states\n(Figure 4). Curiously, the characteristic of the conformational move-\nments of the Trp185 is directly related to the accessibility of the PET\npolymer since its fluctuation modifies the cavity and adjusts the\nmonomer 1 accommodation at the binding site. Also, the movement\nof Trp185 possibly controls the subsite entrance of a new PET mono-\nmer in the binding subsite, thus leading to continuous depolymeriza-\ntion.\n24 Moreover, during the MD simulation, the Trp185 showed\ndifferent conformations that increase the cavity volume of the mono-\nmer 1 to accommodate the polymer (Figures S5 and S6), as previously\nobserved.\n24\nThese variations indicate that the protein alters its conformation\nto receive the substrate. It also indicates that Trp185 is involved in\nthe permanence of the PET monomer in the first binding subsite of\nthe enzyme as previously proposed.14 In the bound state (Figure S7),\nthe Trp185 residue position, as well as all the catalytic residues of the\nprotein, remained stable. This behavior could be associated with\nthe catalytic residues exerting significant interactions with the ligand.\nHowever, the permanence of PET in the binding subsite may\nimpose local structure fluctuation, particularly, on the residue Trp185.\nThis behavior was also observed for Ser160, the main catalytic resi-\ndue. Moreover, the interaction of PET tetramer in the binding subsite\ncauses a displacement of the residue Asp206 located at the\u03b27-\u03b15\nconnecting loop. Conformational changes can play a crucial role in\nregulating the PET binding to the hydrophobic subsites and in the\ncontrol of the catalysis. We noticed in the PCA analysis that the resi-\ndues Asp206 and Trp185 are very flexible. The results also show con-\nsiderable fluctuations in the residue His237 at\u03b28-\u03b16 connecting loop.\nThen, we conjecture that these residues are key residues for the\nmechanism of binding and release of PET.\nPCA result also shows that the most flexible region of the protein\nis located at\u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loops for both systemsIsPETase in the\nunbound and the bound states (Figure 4). It is worth noting that these\nessential dynamics involve almost 37.8% and 25.6% of the motion of\nthe unbound and in the bound systems, respectively (see\nAppendix S1). The results also reveal that participation in the confor-\nmational flexibility of \u03b27-\u03b15 and \u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loop is higher in\nIsPET-PETase complex than inIsPETase without ligand. Therefore, we\nsuggest that the\u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loop may be targeted for mutagen-\nesis to increase theIsPETase stability since it is located far from the\nactive site.\nInitially, we started the MD simulation assuming the PET L-shape\nas the most probable conformation for theIsPETase-PET complex, as\npreviously suggested in other studies.\n13,24 However, Wei et al indi-\ncated that the amorphous PET is highly stiff and its binding into the\nFIGURE 4 Essential motion described\nby the first principal component (PC1) of",
