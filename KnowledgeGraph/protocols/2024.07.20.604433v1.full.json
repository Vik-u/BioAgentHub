    "Yeast culture and display of trifunctional scaffoldin on the yeast cell surface",
    "The yeast cells harboring the surface display plasmid were precultured in SDC medium  (20g/L",
    "For the surface display of the trifunctional scaffoldin, the precultured cells  were inoculated",
    "pBB8-FP-Rf and pBB8 -FP-Cc were inoculated into fresh LB medium  containing kanamycin ,",
    "cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C, and then scaled up at the same temperature  until OD600 reached 0.9",
    "Subsequently, purified dockerin-tagged enzymes were added and",
    "incubated with the yeast cells at 20\u00b0C for 1.5h with continuous shaking",
    "cells were washed with 1x PBS to remove unbound dockerins, and resuspended in Binding buffer",
    "diameter) and thoroughly washed with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol , and deionized water prior to use",
    "The PET films were added to a glass test tube containing 300\u03bcL of yeast cells (OD600 10) followed",
    "To terminate the enzyme reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10000g for 5 minutes",

    "cells were then washed with 1x PBS and resuspended in blocking buffer, followed by the addition",
    "After incubation, the cells were washed with 1x",
    "PBS and fluorescence was measured  using a microplate reader  (BioTek Synergy H1) at the",
    "cells (OD600 5) containing the bound dockerins were centrifuged and washed, followed by blocking",
    "They were then incubated with the anti-C-His antibody conjugated to",
    "After incubation, the cells were washed with 1x PBS and fluorescence was measured ( \u03bbex = 488",
    "Meanwhile, when wild -type yeast cells (lacking the scaffoldin) were incubated with all three",
