    "A starter culture of 5 mL grown in LB Broth containing 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin was prepared, 280",
    "where a single colony from the transformation was inoculated ov ernight at 37 \u00b0C",
    "culture was diluted 200-fold in a fresh 1 L LB Broth containing  50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin, 1.5 M 282",
    "Subcultures were grow n at 37 \u00b0C until the 283",
    "thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to induce the expression of proteins",
    "which, the cultures were incubated overnight at 16 \u00b0C for 18 to 20 hours",

    "The frozen pellet was thawed with the addition of 10mL lysis bu ffer and sonicated to release 293",
    "was loaded on Ni resin and incubated for 1 hour to capture the His-tagged proteins",
    "used to wash the resin, before eluting the bound proteins with 50mM sodium phosphate 297",
    "the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 24 hours in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer\u00ae",
    "The mixture was 308",
