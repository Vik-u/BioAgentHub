  "title": "Salt leverages polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PETase) enzymatic activity via the predicted",
  "steps": [
    "Flag-tag and 9xHistidine tag were added at the C- terminus of the PETase",
    "Induced cultures were grown at 18\u00b0C overnight",
    "Cell suspensions were incubated with 5 mg/ml",
    "Protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Protein",
    "PETase activity was measured  in 96 wells plates for 20 min by optical absorption at 400 nm using",
    "To initiate the chromogenic reaction, 100 \u03bcM p- NPA was added to each well",
    "activities were measured at 24\u00b0C and pH 8.0 unless indicated overwise",
    "with the following chemical additives: NaCl (0.1-5M), glycerol (0\u201325.0%), SDS (0-4.0%), and DMSO (0-",
    "The highest specific activity (3.8-fold increase) was measured at 5M NaCl",
    "addition, increased activities in the presence of SDS <0.5% and 5% (v/v) glycerol were detected",
    "Baseline activity (100%) was measured in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl,"
