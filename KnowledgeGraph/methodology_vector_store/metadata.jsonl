However, it also implied \nthat such a small difference in the elution volume of the two samples did \nnot correlate well with the two major bands showing 15 kD\na \ndifferences \nin mass. The collected gel exclusion chromatographic sample was then \nverified by SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE. It showed that only one band of \n85 kD\na \nappeared in the Native-PAGE gel ( Fig. S6C ), while two major \nbands were still observed in the SDS-PAGE gel ( Fig. S6B ). Clearly, our \nresults confirmed that at least these two major bands represent NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut\n. The extra 70 kD\na \nband might be caused by the structure \ninterference of the fusion construct. Therefore, when cultured in ZYP \nmedium at 20 \n◦\nC, 80 ± 3.7 mg of purified NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas ob -\ntained from 1 L of culture. By taking into account of the mass of NusA \nprotein, the valid production of pure Is PETase\nMut \nis only 27.4 ± 1.3 mg, \nwhich is 4.6-fold higher than the expression of native Is PETase\nMut\n. \nThe expression of Is PETase\nMut \nusing different expression systems in \nE. coli was summarized in Table 1 . Both the chaperone co-expression and \nNusA fusion systems showed a large improvement in the soluble \nexpression of Is PETase\nMut \nin E. coli . It has been reported that in some \ncases the improved soluble expression of target proteins using the two \nstrategies was mainly caused by preventing protein aggregation result -\ning from interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the proteins \n( Emamipour et al., 2019 ; Kaur et al., 2018 ; Lobstein et al., 2012 ; Tat -\nkiewicz et al., 2015 ). Thus, the hydrophobicity of Is PETase\nMut \n(GAP38373.1) was analyzed by using Expasy ( https://web.expasy.org/p \nrotscale/ ), which is commonly used to calculate the hydrophobic or \nhydrophilic scale of proteins ( Kyte and Doolittle, 1982 ; Rafeeq et al., \n2021 ). Meanwhile, the hydrophobic property of its homologous enzyme \nTf Cut2 (YP_288944) was analyzed, the enzyme which showed high \nsecreted expression in E. coli with up to 2.38 g per liter of culture me -\ndium ( Chen et al., 2011 ; Su et al., 2012 , 2013 ). The results showed that \ncompared to Tf Cut2, Is PETase\nMut \ncontained three hydrophobic regions: \nresidues 77 – 86, 103 – 113 and 195 – 215 ( Fig. S7A ), while Tf Cut2 with \nonly two hydrophobic regions: residues 77 – 88 and 166 – 182 \n( Fig. S7B ). Although other factors could not be excluded, such a hy -\ndrophobic property of Is PETase\nMut \nmight be one of the reasons for the \nfact that inclusion bodies were formed with the majority of expressed \nIs PETase\nMut \nin E. coli . \n3.4. Enzyme characterization \nAfter systematic optimization of the expression of Is PETase\nMut \nin \nE. coli , the activity of the purified enzymes was verified using both \nsoluble fragment (BHET) and intact PET with different crystallinities \n(PET-NP with a crystallinity of 9.4% and PET-BP with a crystallinity of \n17.9%) ( Fig. S8 ). For BHET, the reaction was performed in phosphate \nbuffer pH 7.5 (the optimum pH for the reaction) at 30 \n◦\nC. The results \nshowed that the enzymatic activities of Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) were comparable with a specific activity of 2.99 ± 0.08 \nU ⋅ nmol\n\u0000 1\n, while that of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas 1.93 ± 0.03 U ⋅ nmol\n\u0000 1\n, \nindicating that the chaperone GroEL/ES did not show any significant \ninterruption on enzyme structure while facilitating the soluble expres -\nsion of Is PETase\nMut\n. With substrate PET-NP, the total released products \nof 3.5 ± 0.75 mM, 3.8 ± 0.52 mM, and 3.1 ± 0.3 mM were obtained for \nIs PETase\nMut\n, Is PETase (GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut\n, respectively, \nafter 48 h of incubation in 50 mM Gly buffer (pH 9.0) at 30 \n◦\nC, while the \ntotal released products of 47.4 ± 3.3 μ M, 47.6 ± 4.2 μ M and 40.2 ± 0.3 \nμ M were obtained with substrate PET-BP for the three enzymes, \nrespectively. Although the three enzymes did not show a significant \ndifference in the degradation efficiency of PET, they all displayed much \nlower activity toward PET with high crystallinity. \nIn addition, both NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) \nwere further characterized with aspects of thermostability, optimum \ntemperature and optimum pH by using BHET as a model substrate. The \nthermal stability of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) was \ninvestigated using a thermofluor-based assay ( Fig. S9 ). The two enzymes \nshared similar apparent melting temperature T\nm \nvalues of 59.1 and 58.6, \nrespectively, indicating that no significant effect of the fusion NusA \nprotein on the thermal stability of Is PETase\nMut \nwas produced. Moreover, \nboth NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) displayed a similar \noptimal temperature of 45 \n◦\nC ( Fig. S10A ). NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ndisplayed a \nslight shift of optimal pH range (6.5 – 8.0) compared to Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) (6.5 – 7.5) ( Fig. S10B ). NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nshowed approxi -\nmately 1.5-fold improvement on enzyme activity with pH decreasing \nfrom 9.0 to 8.0, while the activity of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) remained \nalmost unchanged at this pH range. Such a catalytic property of NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut \nmight be gained by the structure interference of Is PETase\nMut \nwith NusA protein. \nFig. 3.

Kinetic analysis \nKinetic studies of both Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase -\nMut \nwere performed by adopting a heterogeneous two-step kinetic model \ndue to the insolubility of the PET substrate. In order to calculate accu -\nrately the surface area of PET, the substrate PET-BP instead of PET-NP \nwas used. The hydrolysis of PET-BP catalyzed by the two enzymes was \nanalyzed by HPLC analysis. The obtained data were fitted with equa -\ntions (1) and (2) to obtain the kinetic parameters ( Fig. 4 ). The results \nshowed that the maximum initial rate (V\nmax\n) of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) \nwas 1.23 ± 0.1 μ mol ⋅ L\n\u0000 1\n⋅ h\n\u0000 1\n, which was 1.43-fold higher than that of \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \n(0.86 ± 0.01 μ mol ⋅ L\n\u0000 1\n⋅ h\n\u0000 1\n), and the hydrolysis con -\nstant ( k\n2\n) of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) was 1.6-fold higher than that of \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \n( Table 2 ). In contrast, it was noticed that the \nadsorption constant ( K ) of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas 1.43-fold higher than \nthat of Is PETase\nMut \n( Table 2 ), indicating that the fused NusA protein \nincreased the ability of Is PETase\nMut \nto attach to PET. It is not surprising \ngiven that NusA has been shown to have chaperone activity, and its \nhydrophobic property may play a role in the increased adsorption con -\nstant ( K ) of NusA- Is PETase\nMut\n. It has been reported that the enhanced \nadsorptive ability of PETase could be gained by pre-incubating PET with \nhydrophobic proteins RolA and HGFI ( Puspitasari et al., 2021 ). More -\nover, fusion of carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), a polymer-binding \ndomain that can adhere to a hydrophobic polymer surface, with PETase \nincreased its hydrophobic binding, and consequently increased the hy -\ndrolysis efficiency of PETase ( Dai et al., 2021 ; Ko et al., 2021 ; Ribitsch \net al., 2015 ). Fusing auxiliary domains to the enzyme was proved to be a \ncommonly used strategy to enhance the performance of PET hydrolytic \nenzymes. Taken together, the NusA fusion protein not only promoted the \ncorrect folding of Is PETase\nMut\n, but also conferred new catalytic prop -\nerties to the enzyme. \n3.6. Biodegradation of PET bottle \nTo further investigate the performance of these enzymes in the long- \nterm degradation of PET, PET-NP with low crystallinity was used. The \ndegradation capacity of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas evaluated by the measurement of the total released products of TPA, \nFig. 4. Kinetic analysis of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nin the degradation of PET-BP. Experiments were performed with PET-BP at a fixed area of \n2.4 cm\n2\n⋅ mL\n\u0000 1\n. The solid lines were obtained by fitting the experimental data with equation (1) for panels A and C, and with equation (2) for panels B and D. Error \nbars are the mean of three independent measurements. \nTable 2 \nKinetic parameters of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nobtained \nfrom fitting analysis of Fig. 4   \nK (nM\n\u0000 1\n) k\n2 \n(nmol ⋅ cm\n\u0000 2\n⋅ h\n\u0000 1\n) \nIs PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) 0.069 ± 0.006 nM\n\u0000 1 \n0.682 ± 0.025 nmol cm\n\u0000 2\n⋅ h\n\u0000 1 \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \n0.099 ± 0.007 nM\n\u0000 1 \n0.401 ± 0.011 nmol cm\n\u0000 2\n⋅ h\n\u0000 1  \nL. Aer et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nEnvironmental Research 212 (2022) 113472\n7\nMHET, and BHET ( Fig. S11 ). The results demonstrated that TPA and \nMHET are the main products and a very tiny amount of BHET was \nproduced in all three cases. Such a product pattern was consistent with \nthe results obtained from the other groups ( Austin et al., 2018 ; Yoshida \net al., 2016 ). The degradation behavior of Is PETase\nMut \n(obtained by \ncommon expression method) and Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) is comparable \nas expected. However, it was observed that higher amount of MHET was \naccumulated for NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ncompared to the other two enzymes \n( Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES)). The production of TPA for \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas lower than that for the other two enzymes within \n7 days ( Fig. S11 ), while it reached at the same level afterwards, resulting \nin higher production of total released products after 4 days ( Fig. 5 A). \nAfter two weeks ’ degradation, 1.4-fold higher production with \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas achieved compared to that of Is PETase\nMut \nand \nIs PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) ( Fig. 5 A). A similar trend was also obtained by \nweighting the substrate. A weight loss of 19.6 ± 2.3 mg was obtained for \nPET-NP catalyzed by NusA- Is PETase\nMut\n, which was 1.43-fold higher \nthan that catalyzed by the other two enzymes ( Fig. 5 B). The enhanced \ndegradation capacity of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwas further proved by SEM \nimaging ( Fig. S12 ). Taken together, these results indicated that \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \ndisplayed a unique biodegradation behavior toward \nPET-NP compared to Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES), showing \nan applicatioTfn potential on the long-term biodegradation of PET-NP. \nTo gain more information related to the unique biodegradation \nbehavior of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ntoward PET-NP, the enzyme activity to -\nward MHET was determined with both Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut\n. The specific activities of 3.48 ± 0.1 mU ⋅ nmol\n\u0000 1 \nand \n1.02 ± 0.18 mU ⋅ nmol\n\u0000 1 \nwere obtained for the two enzymes, respec -\ntively. The results proved the fact that the accumulation of MHET with \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \nis more likely caused by the lower activity toward \nMHET than the other two enzymes ( Fig. S13 ). \nIt was surprised that NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nproceeded the long-term \ndegradation of PET with a higher efficiency than the other two en -\nzymes, although it had a lower hydrolysis constant. It was noticed that \nthe optimum pH result of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nshowed a higher relative \nactivity when pH went down from 9 to lower when BHET was used as a \nmodel substrate ( Fig. S10B ). Therefore, we speculated that such a pH \ninterference could lead to a higher released products of NusA- Is PETa -\nse\nMut \nsince the acidification of the reaction system upon the production \nof TPA was observed during the biodegradation of PET-NP in 50 mM Gly \nbuffer at pH 9.0. Thus, the biodegradation of PET-NP was performed at a \npH range from 8 to 9. However, it was not what we expected since the \nenzymatic activities of Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwere 58.5% and 51.8% of those at pH 9, respectively, when the reaction \nwas performed at pH 8.5 ( Fig. S14 ). Moreover, even no enzymatic re -\naction was observed at pH 8.0. \nAfter excluding pH interference, the inhibition effect of TPA, the \nmain product of the reaction, on the degradation efficacy of both Is PE -\nTase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) and NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ntoward PET-NP was investi -\ngated. Being the cosolvent of TPA, DMSO was proved to have a slight \ndecrease effect on the degradation efficiency of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwith \nincreasing the concentration of DMSO, but an opposite effect was \nobserved for Is PETase\nMut \n( Fig. S15A ). Such a positive effect of DMSO on \nthe conversion of amorphous PET film was observed with both wild-type \nIs PETase and its double mutant variant ( Erickson et al., 2022 ). \nWhen TPA was added to the reaction system, a clear inhibition effect \nwas observed with the two enzymes. Is PETase\nMut \n(GroEL/ES) showed a \nsignificant decrease in degradation capacity with increasing the con -\ncentration of TPA, while the inhibition trend of TPA on NusA- Is PETa -\nse\nMut \ntended to go slowly with the concentration of TPA below 1 mM. \nHowever, the inhibition became more pronounced when the concen -\ntration of TPA reach to 2 mM with the relative activity of 57.4 ± 0.3% \nfor NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nand 41.2 ± 1.8% for Is PETase\nMut \n( Fig. S15B ). Till \nnow, our results proved that both enhanced adsorption capacity toward \nPET and the reduced product inhibition effect of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ncould contribute to the fact that NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nperformed long-term \ndegradation of PET with a higher efficiency than the other two enzymes. \nHowever, other factors rather than those we explored could not be \nexcluded and still need to be further investigated. \n3.7. Structural analysis of NusA-IsPETase\nMut \nTo reveal the nature of the observed catalytic properties of NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut\n, the structure model of the enzyme was predicted by using \nAlphaFold2 that represents one of the most popular ones to enable the \nprediction with a high accuracy ( Callaway, 2020 ; Gupta et al., 2021 ; \nJumper et al., 2021 ; Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021 ). The obtained model \nof NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nwith the highest confidence, indicating an average \npredicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) of 86.7 and the pLDDT \nof the structural regions were all above 90 ( Fig. 6 A). Thus, the structure \nprediction of NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nis highly plausible since pLDDT > 90 is \nused as the cut-off point for a high precision ( Tunyasuvunakool et al., \n2021 ). \nTo demonstrate whether NusA affects the folding of Is PETase\nMut\n, we \nchosen root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and TM-align ( https://zh \nanggroup.org/TM-align/ ) for structural comparison of NusA- \nFig. 5.

The results showed that a RMSD of 0.348 \nand TM-score of 0.99601 were obtained in our case, suggesting that the \nNusA fusion did not show a significant interference on the overall \nstructure of Is PETase\nMut \n( Fig. 6 B). \nFig. 6.

The results \nshowed that the hydrophobic surface area of Is PETase\nMut \nand NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut \nwas 1634.2 Å\n2 \nand 9725.2 Å\n2\n, accounting for 16.8% and \n21.6% of the overall area of the two enzymes, respectively, which \nindicated that the surface of NusA protein is more hydrophobic than \nIs PETase\nMut \nalone ( Fig. S16 ). Such a hydrophobic property of NusA \ncould be accounted for the enhanced adsorption capacity of NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut \ntoward PET-NP. \nTo further investigate the differences in enzyme characteristics due \nto the fusion of NusA, we performed molecular docking calculations \nwith both NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nand Is PETase\nMut \nby using 2PET as a model \nsubstrate. The docking results showed that 2PET bound with the two \nenzymes in a productive way, with hydrogen bonds formed between the \ncatalytic residue Ser160 (Ser 678 in NusA- Is PETase\nMut\n, 678 is the sum of \nthe residue number of Ser160 in Is PETase\nMut \nplus the total residue \nnumber of NusA 518) and the carbonyl group of 2PET. Moreover, the \nbinding free energy of 2PET with Nus- Is PETase\nMut \n( \u0000 5.03 kcat ⋅ mol\n\u0000 1\n) \nwas a slightly higher that of Is PETase\nMut \n( \u0000 5.45 kcat ⋅ mol\n\u0000 1\n). It was \nobserved that the binding mode of 2PET with the two enzymes was \ncomparable with a slight difference of the binding orientation in the \nsecond benzene ring of 2PET, resulting in the loss of hydrogen bond \nforming between the oxygen of 2PET with the NH group of Trp 703 in \nNusA- Is PETase\nMut \n( Is PETase\nMut \nTrp 185 forms a 2.6 Å hydrogen bond \nwith the oxygen of 2PET), but forming a new hydrogen bond between \nthe backbone NH2 group of Tyr605 and carbonyl oxygen of 2PET (2.4 Å) \n( Fig. 6 C and D). Moreover, the hydrogen bond formed between Asn 759 \nand 2PET (2.5 Å) in NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nis weaker than that of Asn 241 \nwith 2PET (2.3 Å) in Is PETase\nMut\n, which might be due to the fact that the \nT-stacking interaction of Trp 159 with the first benzene ring of 2PET in \nIs PETase\nMut \nis stronger than that in NusA- Is PETase\nMut \n(Trp 677) ( Fig. 6 C \nand D). Taken together, these binding differences might account for the \nhigher binding free energy of PET with NusA- Is PETase\nMut \nover Is PETa -\nse\nMut\n, thus, conferring new characteristics of NusA- Is PETase\nMut\n. \n4. Conclusion \nIn this study, we systematically investigated the soluble production \nof Is PETase\nMut \nin E. coli by adopting multiple strategies. Our results \nindicated that the formation of inclusion bodies of the overexpressed \nIs PETase\nMut \nin E. coli is more likely due to protein aggregation resulting \nfrom interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the proteins \nrather than the existence of disulfide bond. Thus, a large improvement \non the soluble expression of Is PETase\nMut \nwas obtained by adopting co- \nexpression with chaperone GroEL/ES and fusion expression with NusA \nprotein. Activity measurements proved that GroEL/ES promotes the \ncorrect folding of Is PETase\nMut\n, while structure prediction analysis \nshowed that NusA- Is PETase\nMut \ndisplays a specific structure with Is PE -\nTase\nMut \nencircled by the NusA protein, endowing the fusion enzyme new \ncatalytic characteristics. The increased adsorption capacity of NusA- \nIs PETase\nMut \non PET and the reduced inhibition of the product could \nensure a higher catalytic efficiency for long-term biodegradation of PET \nbottle. Taken together, our studies provide not only an efficient way to \nproduce soluble recombinant Is PETase\nMut\n, but also the kinetic investi -\ngation of the resulting enzymes on PET degradation, all of which could \nset a solid contribution to the biodegradation of PET. \nCredit author statement"}

D-HLCB. E. coli cells that contained the HLCB expression sys -\ntem were coincubated with PET film from waste PET bags, and the re -\nsults further highlighted the roles of fused CBMs in PET biodegradation. \nThe fused CBMs could act on PET substrates, contributing to the efficient \ndegradation of PETase; these effects might result from the colonized \nCBMs on the PET surface, which lead to higher concentrations of PETase \nand better contact on the PET film. \nSimilar to the reaction catalysed by HLCB, a longer time is needed for \nthe CBMs to efficiently react with the PET surface, which leads to slower \ninitial degradation (~25 h, Fig. 6 (3)). Subsequently, PET depolymer -\nization dramatically increased as the released products accumulated \nfaster and increased in concentrations over time. The highest yield of \nmonomeric products was up to 1.03 mM.

Molecular insights into the catalytic mechanisms of HCLB \n3.4.1. Investigation of the PET-binding mechanisms of CBMs \nThe noncatalytic domains widely present in polysaccharide- \ndegrading enzymes can facilitate substrate recognition and binding. \nAlthough CBM binding is promiscuous, it helps enrich the enzyme on the \nsubstrate surface. Among the different CBMs, type A CBMs (e.g., \nBa CBM2) are surface-binding proteins that include members of families \n1, 2a, 3, 5, and 10. They are usually characterized by their high ability to \nbind insoluble, highly crystalline polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose and \nchitin). This process is largely promoted by the special platform-like \nbinding site lined by several surface-exposed aromatic amino acid resi -\ndues, especially the aromatic triad that consists of W9-W44-W63 (for \nBa CBM2, Fig. 8 (1)) ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). \nDocking studies showed that 2-HE(MHET)\n4 \ncould readily enter the \nbinding site of Ba CBM, and the surrounding polar amino acids could \ninteract with the PET surface mainly through π -stacking interactions \n(shown as pink dotted lines) and H-bonds (shown as green lines) ( Fig. 8 \n(2, 3, 4)). The roles of W288 and W323 in PET binding were confirmed \nin this study. Residues W288, V322, I327, K326, W309, I306, I298, \nK299, and L311 can form π -stacking interactions with PET; in addition, \nG291, Y292, Q321, S325, K326, K299 and I296 can form H-bonds with \nthe PET surface. However, the initial binding of W342 to PET was not \nidentified. This difference might occur because the initial binding of PET \nlikely induces a structural rearrangement of Ba CBM, resulting in \nsimultaneous access of W342 and N343 to the PET surface ( Weber et al., \n2019; Rennison et al., 2023 ). Therefore, W342 might be a potential \nFig. 8. The substrate binding mechanism of Ba CBM was investigated by molecular docking.  \nT. Wang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nEcotoxicology and Environmental Safety 280 (2024) 116540\n9\ntarget for performing site-directed mutagenesis to improve the affinity \nof Ba CBM for the PET surface ( Rennison et al., 2023 ). \n3.4.2. Docking studies of the PET-degrading mechanisms of HP \nIs PETases belong to the α / β hydrolase superfamily, and the central \ntwisted β -sheet is formed by 9 mixed β -strands and surrounded by 7 \nα -helices ( Joo et al., 2018 ). As expected, Is PETase also contains the \nhighly conserved serine hydrolase G-X1-S-X2-G motif \n(G158-W159-S160-M161-G162), which is located at the active site. \nThe catalytic activity and thermostability of PETase are closely \nlinked to its structural effects, such as its conformation and different \nfolded/native states. On the other hand, although crystal structures of \ndifferent PETases or complex structures with monomeric products (e.g., \nHEMT [PDB ID: 5XH3]) have already been described, relatively few \ndetailed structures that illustrate the degradation process of PET sub -\nstrates are available. To gain further insight into the potential func -\ntionalities, especially the structural roles, of PETase and CBMs, \nmolecular docking simulations were carried out with the 2-HE(MHET)\n4 \nmolecule as the ligand. The residues lining the binding cleft residues \nwere set as flexible during the docking simulations. \nAs shown in Fig. 9 (A), the polymer chain 2-HE(MHET)\n4 \nof PET could \nsuitably stretch to fill the substrate binding cleft (PETase) across the \nprotein surface, and the TPA moiety could bind to the active site in a way \nsimilar to the MHET complex structure of a cutinase from Thermobifida \nfusca ( Yang et al., 2023b ; Zeng et al., 2022 ). At the active site, the TPA \nmoiety is located exactly immediately above the catalytic triad formed \nby S160, H237, and D206. In addition, the substrate in the long binding \ncleft could be further stabilized by different interactions. The TPA \nmoiety is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (formed with I208 and \nA89, shown as pink dotted lines in Fig. 9 (B)) and weak H-bonding \n(formed with Y87, shown as a light green dotted line in Fig. 9 (B)). The \naliphatic part is mainly maintained by H-bond interactions formed with \nC233, G234, S245, S242, and G243, especially 2 strong H-bonds formed \nwith S92 ( Fig. 9 (B)). Through these interactions, the whole polymer \nchain could be tightly bound to the active site. \nAs shown in Fig. 10 (A), this binding cleft may accommodate as long \nas four monomers, 2-HE(MHET) (2-HE(MHET)\n4\n). Therefore, PET- might \nbe biodegraded in an ‘ endo ’ way catalysed by PETase, similar to the \nfunctions of TfCut, which first causes random cleavage of the side chains \nthat enter the binding cleft. Once the smaller degrading intermediates \n(e.g., 2-HE(MHET)\n4\n, 2-HE(MHET)\n4\n, and MHET) are released, the “ exo - \nreaction ” could further catalyse the hydrolysis of the produced in -\ntermediates into various monomeric products, such as MHET, TPA, and \nEG. \nTo investigate the abovementioned mechanism of PETase degrada -\ntion, MHET and 2-HE(MHET)\n2 \nwere chosen as substrate mimics for use \nFig. 9.

The docking results revealed that the binding \nmodes of MHET ( Fig. 10 (B)) and 2-HE(MHET)\n2\n, which were bound to \nthe binding cleft, ( Fig. 10 (A)) proximal to the catalytic S160were similar \nto each other. The aromatic ring of the TPA moiety forms π -stacking \ninteractions with W185, M161 and Y87 (shown as pink dotted lines); \nmoreover, the carbonyl group of the reactive ester bond can form H- \nbonds with Y87 and G86. In particular, site-directed mutagenesis further \ndemonstrated that Y87 dramatically influences PET degradation ( Han \net al., 2017 ), which might be caused by a decreased substrate binding \naffinity, as mentioned above. Therefore, the results strongly suggested \nFig. 10.

W185 functions as a “gatekeeper”, \nand the orientation of its side chain plays a critical role in accommo -\ndating the longer chains of PET substrates (Fig. 10(C)). The results also \nrevealed that regulating the flexibility of the W185 region (Liu et al., \n2022) contributes to the catalytic performance of the DuraPETa -\nse\nN233C/S282C/H214S/S245R \nmutant. Furthermore, it was found that the \nsegment around the active site (R171, N186, F218, S214, D186) plays \ncritical roles in regulating the degradation activity and thermostability \nof PETase (Joho et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021b), possibly through \n“W185 wobbling” and β6-β7 loop flexibility. \nLike that of carboxylesterases, protonated S160 of PETase should \nfunction as a covalent nucleophile for the carbonyl carbon atom in the \nscissile ester bond (Liu et al., 2023), and this initial acylation may be the \nrate-limiting step for the catalytic process of PETase (Boneta et al., \n2021). In addition, a study indicated that the initial acylation and final \ndeacylation steps (substrate release) might be the competing \nrate-limiting steps (Feng et al., 2021). As shown by the docking studies \n(Fig. 10(D)), MHET and 2-HE(MHET)\n2 \nare very stable in the active site, \nand their reactive ester bonds are directly related to the catalytic S160. \nThis binding pose facilitates an attack of the active ester bond by the \ncatalytic residue S160."}

Conclusions \nPET-plastics have been widely applied in daily life as storage mate -\nrials and synthetic fabrics. However, resistance to chemical and bio -\nlogical degradation has led to the rapid accumulation of PET wastes in \nterrestrial and marine ecosystems at a terrifying rate. Recently, \nnumerous efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this problem \nthrough the enzymatic hydrolysis of PETase-mediated PET degradation. \nIn this study, a promising IsPETase mutant (HP) was applied for efficient \nPET biodegradation, which should be amenable to industrial application \nat mild temperature. The carbohydrate-binding module fused to PETase \nwas further confirmed to improve the degradation of PET, including its \ncatalytic activity and thermostability. However, the detailed mechanism \nresponsible for the increased thermostability should be further investi -\ngated. Moreover, the whole-cell biocatalyst D-HLCB was shown to \nexhibit high thermal stability and high PET degradation activity. In \nparticular, the HLCB displayed on the surface of E. coli could be used to \nefficiently degrade PET through enzymatic catalysis. Moreover, D-HLCB \nwas shown to display good reusability and stability and could maintain \nmore than 50 % of its initial activity for 9 cycles. This whole-cell catalyst \nshows great potential for providing an economical and efficient \napproach for the industrial biodegradation of PET waste. \nMoreover, we elucidated the substrate-binding mechanisms and \npotential degradation mechanisms of PETase, and the critical residues \nassociated with these biological processes were also identified. It is \nstrongly believed that this structural information could be very effec -\ntively utilized in rational molecular engineering of PETase to further \nimprove its thermal stability and PET degradation activity, which would \nprovide opportunities for further industrial biodegradation of PET \nwaste. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nTao Wang: Writing – review & editing, Supervision, Project \nadministration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization.

Eco- \nfriendly options, such as recycling, present noticeable boundaries. For \ninstance, despite the high collection rates of PET (up to 50%), the quality \nof recycled PET final products tends to be lower than the virgin materials \n[15,16] . Biodegradable polymers have also been proposed as a green \nalternative, since they can degrade under environmental conditions. \nTheir degradation is facilitated by the enzymatic machinery of various \nmicroorganisms breaking them down in oligo- and monomers [9,17] . \nNonetheless, biodegradables have not been proven to be a panacea, as \ntheir natural degradation can take several decades, depending on \nenvironmental conditions [18 – 20] . To address this limitation, a more \ndirect and controlled approach of degradation through enzymatic pro -\ncesses might accrue, leading to a bio-dependent, eco-friendly and \nfeasible strategy for managing plastic waste. \nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in discovering \nnovel plastic-degrading enzymes, with a focus on polyesters, particu -\nlarly PET, a major contributor to plastic pollution. The persistent nature \nof PET is attributed to the presence of aromatic components in its \nbackbone, which hinder access by microorganisms and prevent \nbiodegradation [21] . Most PET-degrading enzymes are bacterial and \nfungal carboxylesterases, belonging mostly to the cutinase family, which \nin nature conduce to the degradation of cutin, a natural waxy polyester \n[22] . Even though numerous enzymes have been discovered or engi -\nneered so far to efficiently degrade amorphous PET, degradation of the \npolymer ’ s crystalline regions remains a challenge [23] . \nOne of the central figures in amorphous PET biodegradation is the \nmetagenome-derived LC-Cutinase (LCC), which has been extensively \ninvestigated for this ability. Recent advancements have led to the \ndevelopment of a thermostable variant of LCC (LCC\nICCG\n) that exhibits \nhigh specificity towards PET and demonstrates remarkable efficiency in \ndepolymerizing amorphized PET waste [24,25] . Concerning high crys -\ntallinity PET, it seems that LCC\nICCG \npresents room for improvement \nwhile a latest study proved that further protein engineering might be the \nsolution [26] . Notably, LCC\nICCG \nis the only enzyme to be industrialized \nfor PET biorecycling, with a processing temperature of 72 \n◦\nC, and is \nexpected to be implemented on a large scale in the near future [23,27] . \nPolymer biodegradation has been suggested to be more effective near \nthe glass transition temperature ( T\ng\n), since chains are more accessible to \nenzymes, due to the abrupt conversion of the plastic state from glassy to \nrubbery [28,29] . For this reason, thermostability of PET hydrolases has \nbeen considered as an important feature, since T\ng \nof PET is around 70 \n◦\nC. \nHowever, the temporal aspect of PET degradation at those temperatures \nis very crucial, as studies demonstrated a correlation between polymer ’ s \ncrystallinity degree increase and reaction duration. Notably, PET storage \nat temperatures around its T\ng \nfor 48 h, initiates not only its “ physical \naging ” , but also the rearrangement of shorter polymer segments, leading \nto an increase in crystallinity, hindering the enzymatic depolymeriza -\ntion further [30,31] . Consequently, enzymatic degradation of amor -\nphous PET at temperatures near its T\ng\n, only makes sense for short \nreaction times, necessitating the utilization of enzymes with very high \ncatalytic turnover, such as LCC\nICCG\n. For lower reaction temperatures, \npolymer aging and crystallization are not an issue, hence slower en -\nzymes can also be utilized. \nIn fact, amorphous PET degradation has been shown at milder \ntemperatures of 30 – 50 \n◦\nC by the benchmark mesophilic PETase from the \nbacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 ( Is PETase) [32] and its thermo -\nstable variants. The most recently-designed variant, FAST-PETase (a \nquintuple mutation of Is PETase), outperformed the thermotolerant \nLCC\nICCM\n, by presenting 5-fold higher degradation of amorphous post -\nconsumer PET products at 50 \n◦\nC [33] . This fact is indicating that protein \nengineering of non-thermophilic PET hydrolases could work as a greener \nroute of PET degradation at lower temperatures. \nIn the present study, we report the discovery and biochemical \ncharacterization of a novel cutinase-like enzyme, designated as Dm PE -\nTase, from the bacterium Deinococcus maricopensis . Dm PETase ’ s \ndemonstrated polyesterase activity is compared to the benchmark PET- \ndegrader LCC\nICCG \non a broad range of synthetic materials, including \ncommercial plastics, such as PET and polyether polyurethane, as well as \nthe biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS), polycaprolactone \n(PCL), polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA). Empha -\nsizing on PET, our research focused on the effect of crystallinity on PET \ndegradation, as PETases discovered to date have been shown to effi -\nciently hydrolyze amorphous or low crystallinity PET, but their effec -\ntiveness is significantly limited at increased crystallinity [31] . To this \naim, enzymatic reactions were conducted with virgin, amorphous and \nsemi-crystalline powder, as well as with two types (transparent, colored) \nof post-consumer water bottles in their original and powdered form. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Sequence and structural analysis of DmPETase \nThe identification of the signal peptide for the full-length sequence of \nthe E8U721 (UniProtKB) protein was performed using SignalP-6.0 [34] . \nA phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 11.0 using the \nNeighbor-Joining method, which incorporated 25 sequences from the \nPDB database that were homologous to E8U721. The AlphaFold2 \n(AF2)-generated 3D structure of the enzyme was downloaded from the \nAlphaFold Protein Structure Database (UniProt ID: E8U721) and visu -\nalized by UCSF Chimera v1.15, excluding the native signal peptide \n(residues 1 – 33) and the residues 34 – 55, due to the absence of secondary \nstructure information and their misalignment with structures of other \npolyesterase structures.

Clear lysates, collected after two rounds of centrifuga -\ntion at 20,000 x g for 20 and 30 min, respectively, at 4 \n◦\nC, were loaded \nonto immobilized metal-ion (Co\n2 +\n) affinity chromatography (IMAC) \ncolumns (Talon, Clontech; 1.0 cm i.d., 15 cm length) equilibrated with \nthe same buffer. The columns were then washed with buffer and imid -\nazole of varying concentration, 0 – 100 mM, as previously described [35] . \nThe purity of the isolated Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nwas confirmed by \nsodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \n(SDS-PAGE), using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins concen -\ntration was calculated through conversion of the absorbance at 280 nm, \nvia the molar extinction coefficient of the enzymes, determined by \nProtParam tool from ExPASy [36] . The fractions containing the purified \nenzymes were dialyzed for 16 h at 4 ℃ against a 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, \n150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole buffer, for Dm PETase, and a 25 mM \nTris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl buffer, for LCC\nICCG\n. \n2.3. Biochemical characterization of recombinant DmPETase and \nLCC\nICCG \nThe cutinase activity of the enzymes was assayed using 1 mM p - \nnitrophenyl butyrate ( p NPB) in 0.1 M phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 6.0), \nat 35 \n◦\nC for 10 min, by adding 20 μ L of enzyme preparation in 230 μ L of \nsubstrate solution, and monitoring the release of p -nitrophenol ( p NP) at \n410 nm in a SpectraMax-250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, \nSunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with SoftMaxPro software (version 1.1, \nMolecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Enzymatic activity is \nexpressed in Units (U) as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μ mol of p NP \nper minute. \nKinetic studies on Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nwere performed with p - \nnitrophenyl water-soluble fatty acid esters with varying chain lengths, \nincluding p- nitrophenyl acetate ( p NPA), p NPB, p -nitrophenyl octanoate \n( p NPO) and p -nitrophenyl decanoate ( p NPD), which have two, four, \neight and ten carbon atoms, respectively, under standard p NP assay \nconditions. Estimation of kinetic constants was accomplished through a \nnon-linear regression model in GraphPad Prism 5 from GraphPad Soft -\nware, Inc (USA). \nThe optimum temperature and pH of Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nwere \ndetermined by assaying enzyme activity on p NPB, under standard p NP \nassay conditions, in varying temperatures (30 – 90 \n◦\nC) and pH values \n(5.0 – 9.0). Buffer systems used were 0.1 M citrate-phosphate (C-P, pH \n5.0 – 6.0), 0.1 M sodium-phosphate (S-P, pH 6.0 – 8.0) and 0.1 M Tris-HCl \n(T-H, pH 8.0 – 9.0). The thermostability of Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nwas \nstudied by measuring their residual activity, under standard p NP assay \nconditions, after incubation in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl \nbuffer at temperatures ranging from 20\n◦\nto 80\n◦\nC for up to 72 h. The \neffect of pH on the enzyme stability was studied by measuring enzymes \nresidual activity, under standard p NP assay conditions, after their in -\ncubation in different buffer systems in the range of pH 5.0 – 10.0 for 24 h \nat 4 \n◦\nC. Buffer systems used were 0.2 M citrate-phosphate (C-P, pH \n3.0 – 6.0), 0.2 M sodium-phosphate (S-P, pH 6.0 – 8.0), 0.2 M Tris-HCl (T- \nH, pH 8.0 – 9.0) and 0.2 M glycine-NaOH (G-N, pH 9.0 – 10.0). Residual \nactivity was then compared to the one of standard storage buffers, as \ndescribed in paragraph 2.2. \n2.4. Polymeric materials \n2.4.1. Synthetic aliphatic polyesters, aliphatic-aromatic polyether and post- \nconsumer PET \nThe initial form of target commercial synthetic aliphatic polyesters \nand aliphatic-aromatic polyether was pellets, except for amorphous PET \nfilm. Polyesters tested included aged PBS (initial grade NaturePlast \nPBE003, NaturePlast, France), PCL (CAPA 6500, Ravago Chemicals, \nBelgium), PET\nI \n(PAPET clear, Lotte Chemical, UK), PET\nII \n(destined for \nblow molding to commercial beverage bottle), PHB (Biomer P226, \nBiomer, Germany), PLA (4043D, NatureWorks, USA) and polyether PU \n(LPR7560, Coim, Laripur). The post-consumer PET used in this study \nwas obtained from commercial, transparent and colored, water bottles. \n2.4.2. Preparation and pretreatment of target polymers \nTo prepare the target polymers in powder form, pellets of PBS, PCL, \nPET\nI\n, PET\nII\n, PHB and PLA, amorphous PET film, as well as whole pieces \nof transparent and colored, post-consumer PET bottles (excluding caps \nand labels) were initially immersed in liquid nitrogen and subsequently \nmilled in a PULVERISETTE 14 (FRITSCH Corp., Idar-Oberstein, Ger -\nmany) at 17,000 rpm, supplementing liquid nitrogen in order to avoid \nsintering. Resulting powders (particle size < 500 µ m ) of PBS, PCL, PET\nI \n(cPET), PET\nII \n(bPET), PHB, PLA and amorphous PET film (aPET) were \ndried under vacuum (300 mbar) under variable time and temperature \nconditions; PBS and PLA at 80 \n◦\nC for 5 h, PCL at 40 \n◦\nC for 24 h, aPET and \ncPET at 140 \n◦\nC for 8 h, PHB at 60 \n◦\nC for 2 h and PU at 90 \n◦\nC for 3 h. \nIn order to investigate post-consumer PET degradation, pieces were \nhole-punched from various parts of the bottle, including the neck, \nshoulder, body and bottom ( Figs. S1 and S2 ). This sampling approach \nfacilitated the examination of potential variations in PET degradation \nacross different regions of the bottle. Resulting pieces from transparent \nbottle ’ s shoulder (tsPET), body (tbdPET), and bottom (tbtPET), as well \nas colored bottle ’ s shoulder (gsPET), body (gbdPET), and bottom \n(gbtPET) were all characterized by a diameter of 3.5 mm, while pieces \nfrom transparent and colored bottle ’ s neck, tnPET and gnPET, respec -\ntively, had a diameter of 3.0 mm. For the degradation of PET chips, it \nwas assumed that enzymatic degradation occurs on the surface of the \nchips, with chips ’ thickness being considered negligible. \n2.4.3. Properties of target polymers \nThe characterization of all materials ( Table S1 ), including the \ndetermination of polymers ’ average molecular weight ( M\nn\n), melting \npoints of first and second heating cycle ( T\nm 1 \nand T\nm 2\n), relevant mass \nfraction crystallinity ( x\nc\n, %), crystallization point ( T\nc\n) and crystalliza -\ntion enthalpy ( Δ H\nc\n, J g\n-1\n), was conducted in accordance with the \nmethodologies outlined previously [37] . All samples were tested in \nduplicates. \n2.5. Enzymatic hydrolysis of polymeric materials \n2.5.1. Synthetic polyesters and polyether polyurethane materials \nEnzymatic reactions were performed with 10 mg mL\n-1 \nof polymeric \npowder (PBS, PCL, PHB, PLA, PU) in 0.1 M sodium-phosphate buffer pH \n7.0, at 50\n◦\nC, under agitation (1350 rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer \nComfort (Eppendorf, Germany) for 72 h. Reactions, of 0.5 mL, were \ninitiated by the addition of 0.5 nmol of enzyme, while another 0.25 nmol \nwere supplemented after 24 and 48 h. After 72 h (except for PCL re -\nactions at 24 h) the residual material was isolated by centrifugation, \ntriple washed with ultrapure water (Labaqua HPLC, ultrapure water \nsystem, Biosan, Latvia) and freeze-dried (Freeze dryer ALPHA 1 – 4, \nBraun Biotech International, Germany). \nBiodegradation of synthetic polyesters was evaluated through mass \nloss and alteration of polymer ’ s number average molecular weight ( M\nn\n) \nand weight average ( M\nw\n), determined by Gel permeation chromatog -\nraphy (GPC). GPC was performed using two PLgel MIXED-D 5 µ m \nK.

A refractive index detector \n(RID) (G7162A) at 650 nm, in an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC instrument \n(Agilent Technologies, Germany) was utilized, calibrated with poly -\nstyrene standards of molecular weight from 162 to 500.000 g/mol \n(EasiVial PS-M 2 mL, Great Britain). Samples, 2 mg mL\n-1\n, were prepared \nby dissolving the residual powders in THF or CHCl\n3\n, using an Ultrasonic \ncleaner WUC-1,2 – 22 Litre 40 kHz (witeg Laboerthechnik GmbH, Ger -\nmany) and filtered through 0.2 µ m syringe filters. \n2.5.2. Virgin and post-consumer PET materials \nEnzymatic reactions were conducted with 10 mg mL\n-1 \nof virgin and \npost-consumer PET powders (aPET, cPET, tPET, gPET and bPET) or post- \nconsumer PET bottle pieces (tnPET, tsPET, tbdPET, tbtPET, gnPET, \ngsPET, gbdPET and gbtPET) in 0.1 M sodium-phosphate buffer pH 7.0, \nat 50\n◦\nC, under agitation (1350 rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer \nComfort (Eppendorf, Germany) for 72 h. Post-consumer PET samples \nwere initially washed three times using ultrapure water solution with \n1% SDS and 20% ethanol, subsequently triple washed with ultrapure \nwater and finally freeze-dried. Reactions of 0.5 mL were initiated by the \naddition of 0.5 nmol of enzyme, while, in some cases, another 0.25 nmol \nwere supplemented after 24 and 48 h, in order to investigate the \nimportance of enzyme renewal in biodegradation performance as well as \ncatalyst ’ s stability. After 72 h the enzymatic reaction was terminated by \nadding HCl 6 M at a final concentration of 0.1% v/v, the supernatant \nwas separated from the residual material with centrifugation and sup -\nplemented with 5% v/v DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide, > = 99.9% purity, \nFischer Chemical, U.K.). PET powder was triple washed with ultrapure \nwater (Labaqua HPLC, ultrapure water system, Biosan, Latvia) and \nfreeze-dried. \nBiodegradation of PET was evaluated through weight loss and \nquantification of the water-soluble hydrolysis products, determined by \nhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC performed \nusing a C-18 reverse-phase NUCLEOSIL ® 100 – 5 (Macherey-Nagel, Ger -\nmany) with mobile phase 20% v/v acetonitrile ( > = 99.9% purity, \nFischer Chemical, U.K.), 20% v/v 10 mM sulfuric acid (S.G. 1.84, > =\n95% purity, Fischer Chemical, U.K.) in 60% v/v ultrapure water at a \nflow rate of 0.8 mL min\n-1\n, using a photodiode array detector Varian \nProStar at 241 nm, in an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC instrument (Agilent \nTechnologies, Germany). Quantification of PET degradation products \nwas performed through calibration curves with standard concentrations \nin the range of 0.01 – 1 mM. \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Unique structural characteristics of the phylogenetically distinct \nDmPETase \nFor expression and characterization, the UniProtKB sequence with ID \nE8U72, belonging to D. maricopensis LB-34 strain, was selected. The \nsequence was annotated as a triacylglycerol lipase and BLASTp against \nUniProtKB/SwissProt database revealed 60% identity to PET hydrolases \nfrom Thermobifida species and LCC. This sequence has also been pointed \nout as a potential PET hydrolase by a previous study [38] . Phylogenetic \nanalysis of characterized PET-degrading enzymes, with known 3D \nstructure, using the Neighbor-Joining method, shows two distinct \nbranches. One contains thermophilic enzymes and the other \nnon-thermophilic enzymes belonging to Burkholderiales and marine \nγ -proteobacteria. In the thermophilic branch, the D. maricopensis enzyme \nforms its own distinct sub-branch, while the other contains enzymes \nfrom thermophilic actinomycetes and metagenomic or unidentified \nsources ( Fig. S3 ). \nThe overall structure of Dm PETase, as predicted by AF2, is nearly \nidentical to other bacterial cutinases, with a root-mean-square deviation \n(rmsd) of 0.737 Å with LCC\nICCG \n(PDB ID: 7w1n) and 0.644 Å with \nIs PETase (PDB ID: 6eqh), as representative thermophilic and mesophilic \nPET-hydrolases (LCC\nICCG \nwith Is PETase have a rmsd of 0.893 Å). The \ncatalytic triad in Dm PETase is Ser185, His263 and Asp231, and the \nenzyme contains a single disulfide bond (DB) between cysteines Cys296- \nCys312, which is common to the other two enzymes and one of the \ncharacteristics that distinguish PET hydrolases into two different classes \n(type I and type II) [23] . The wild-type LCC is a type I PET hydrolase, \ncontaining one BD, but LCC\nICCG \nhas a second DB introduced through \nsite-specific engineering at positions 238 (Asp238Cys) and 283 \n(Ser283Cys). Is PETase, on the other hand is a type II PET hydrolase, its \nsecond DB formed between Cys203 and Cys239 ( Fig. 1 A). \nWhen comparing the substrate-binding cleft of Dm PETase to the one \nfrom LCC\nICCG \nand Is PETase we see that all three enzymes are signifi -\ncantly similar. Fig. 1 A highlights the important residues for binding as \nindicated by the complex structure (PDB ID: 7VVE) of LCC\nICCG \nwith 2- \nhydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) [39] . MHET binds to LCC\nICCG \nthrough residues Trp190, Val212, His242, Ile243, His164, Ala97, Tyr95 \nand Met166, which are the same in Dm PETase (Trp210, Val233, His263, \nHis184, Tyr117 and Met186) apart from two; Gly264 and Gly119. The \nposition where Gly264 is in Dm PETase, there is Ile243 in LCC\nICCG\n, which \nis one of the mutated residues. The Ile243 substitution in LCC\nICCG \nex -\npands the substrate-binding tunnel and may increase the PET-binding \ncapacity, while in the wild-type Dm PETase there is already a smaller \nresidue at the same site. Comparing the width of the binding-site at that \nregion ( Fig. 1 B), we can see that for LCC\nICCG \nand Is PETase it is 9.3 Å and \n9.5 Å, respectively, while for Dm PETase it is 10.9 Å, which is signifi -\ncantly wider. \nPrevious research has demonstrated the impact of surface charges on \nthe PET-degrading capability of various enzymes [40] . Sagong et al. \nproposed that negatively charged residues distal from the active site \nwere more conducive to PET hydrolysis [41] , while other studies sug -\ngested that an electrically neutral enzyme surface might reduce elec -\ntrostatic repulsion with the polymer [42,43] . Fig. S4 illustrates the \ndistribution of electrostatic potential on the surface of Dm PETase next to \nthat of LCC\nICCG \nand Is PETase. It is evident that both LCC\nICCG \nand Is PE -\nTase have positive charges on their front side, while Dm PETase is mostly \nneutral. Similarly, the bottom side of LCC\nICCG \nand Is PETase is predom -\ninantly positively charged, while Dm PETase is mostly neutral with small \nareas of negative and positive charges. A clear distinction can also be \nobserved on the top/back side of the enzymes, where Dm PETase has a \nregion that is a considerably more negatively charged than the other two \nPET-hydrolases (green circles), whereas there is another small region at \nthe top, near the active-site cleft (yellow circles), where Dm PETase is \nslightly less negatively charged than the other two enzymes. Interest -\ningly, despite the fact that LCC\nICCG \nand Is PETase are derived from \nentirely different sources and have very distinct properties, they display \na remarkably similar electrostatic surface, which is dissimilar to the one \nof Dm PETase. \nIn a very recent study, a machine-learning tool in combination with \nevolutionary analysis was used to mutate LCC\nICCG\n, aiming in variants \nwith increased activity on semi-crystalline PET. The most effective \nvariant (LCCICCG_I6M) contained 6 point mutations, namely Asp53Thr, \nSer67Lys, Ser133Arg, Thr188Pro, Glu208Gln, and Asn249Pro [26] . \nSurprisingly, all positions apart from one (Thr188Pro) are located on the \nsurface of the enzyme and mostly involve mutation of uncharged resi -\ndues into positively charged or negatively charged residues into un -\ncharged. At the respective positions Dm PETase contains either polar \nuncharged (Ser88, Gln229, Asn270) or charged residues (Arg74 and \nAsp155). Regardless, this work highlights the effect of surface residues \non the ability of a PET hydrolase to degrade crystalline PET. \n3.2. Biochemical characterization of DmPETase and LCC\nICCG \nDm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nwere recombinantly expressed, purified to \nK. Makryniotis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nJournal of Hazardous Materials 455 (2023) 131574\n5\nhomogeneity and concentrated in solutions, while their molecular \nweights (MW) were determined at 31 and 29 kDa, respectively, via their \nappearance as single bands ο n 12% SDS-PAGE gel ( Fig. S5 ). \nThe optimal temperature for Dm PETase was determined to be 50\n◦\nC, \nwhile LCC\nICCG \nshowed its maximum activity at 60\n◦\nC. ( Fig. 2 A). Both \nenzymes, especially LCC\nICCG\n, presented a thermostable profile retaining \ntheir activity at temperatures of 50\n◦\nC and 60\n◦\nC for Dm PETase ( Fig. 2 C) \nand LCC\nICCG \n( Fig. 2 D) respectively, after a 3-day incubation. Regarding \npH effect, Dm PETase demonstrated maximum activity at pH 6.0, which \ncomes in contrast to the conventional trend observed in most well- \nknown PETases, mainly cutinases, which exhibit activity peak at \nneutral to slightly alkanine pH values [38,44] , similar to LCC\nICCG \nthat \ndisplayed its highest activity at pH 8.5 ( Fig. 2 B). Both enzymes ’ \nmaximum stability was observed for T-H buffer system at pH 9.0 \n( Fig. S6 ). The determination of kinetic constants for both Dm PETase and \nLCC\nICCG \n( Table 1 ) on p NPA, p NPB, p NPO and p NPD indicated a typical \nMichaelis-Menten profile. The results demonstrated that both Dm PETase \nand LCC\nICCG \nshowed the highest catalytic efficiency towards p NPB fol -\nlowed by p NPA, p NPO and p NPD. \nSumming up, Dm PETase ’ s structure, protein sequence and \nbiochemical characterization portray a thermophilic cutinase-like \nenzyme [45] . Further information and detailed commentary on \nbiochemical characterization of both Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \ncan be \nfound in paragraph S1.1 of Supplementary Material . \n3.3. Ability of DmPETase and LCC\nICCG \nto degrade polyester and \npolyurethane-based plastics \nThe capacity of Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \nto degrade synthetic poly -\nmers was tested for non- and bio-degradable synthetic plastics, including \npolyether PU and polyesters such as PBS, PCL, PHB, PLA. Depolymer -\nization degree of each plastic was assessed based on the percentage dry \nmass loss and changes in molecular weights ( M\nn\n, M\nw\n), presented in Fig. 3 \nand Table S3 , respectively."}

Despite the fact that all target poly -\nesters exhibit diversity in their properties ( Table S2 ) and consequently, \nit is challenging to ascertain which of these play a role in degradation of \nthe material, a trend has emerged, wherein both cutinases exhibit a \nhigher capacity for hydrolyzing polyesters with ester bonds spanning \ngreater distance in their structure and monomers with non-substituted \ncarbon atoms. Overall, both polyesterases exhibit similar selectivity \nfor various polyesters and the combination of mass loss and molecular \nalterations might indicate a similar depolymerase mechanism for each \npolymer. \n3.4. Comparison of DmPETase with LCC\nICCG \nto degrade amorphous and \nsemi-crystalline PET materials \nPolymers ’ crystallinity degree is one of the main factors affecting \nenzymatic hydrolysis by restricting the enzymes ’ access to the hydro -\nlyzable bonds [9] . Considering also that PET may exist as amorphous \nand semi-crystalline depending on its processing and thermal conditions \n[48] , a wide range of three virgin (powders) and two post-consumer \n(chips and powders) PET grades with different mass fraction crystal -\nlinities were examined. Overall, across all tested PET samples, a range of \ncrystallinity degrees, spanning from low (6%) to high (40%), was \nobserved.

DmPETase degrades the crystalline part of postconsumer PET bottles \nat the same levels as LCC\nICCG \nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Dm PETase and \nLCC\nICCG \npolyesterases in degrading postconsumer PET bottles. Two \ntypes of water bottles, transparent and a green colored, were employed \nand divided into four different sections, with crystallinity degrees \nranging from 10% to 31% ( Table S1 ). The degradation of the chips by \nboth enzymes was observed over a three-day period, monitoring the \ngeneration of water-soluble products, the concentration of which is \npresented in Figs. S10 and S11 for transparent and green bottle, \nrespectively. \nAs expected, the neck was degraded more efficiently by both en -\nzymes, compared to the rest of the compartments, as it was the one with \nthe lowest crystallinity. LCC\nICCG \nwas significantly more active than \nDm PETase on the neck of both bottle types, resulting in the release of \napproximately 30-fold more hydrolysis products after three days. \nNevertheless, Dm PETase exhibited comparable efficacy to LCC\nICCG \nin \ndegrading the shoulder, body and bottom of both transparent and \ncolored PET bottles, with no statistically significant differences in the \nrelease of hydrolysis products. Degradation of the crystalline parts of \neach bottle did not show statistically important differences, except for \nthe degradation of the green bottom compartment by LCC\nICCG\n, which \nreleased 11-fold more products than the green shoulder. Interestingly, \nthe degradation of shoulder and body compartments reveals a faster \nhydrolysis rate for LCC\nICCG\n, releasing more products in 1.5 days \ncompared to Dm PETase, which achieved the same level of degradation \non the third day. \nThe degradation yields of transparent and colored bottles showed \nthat parts of the green bottle were more susceptible to biodegradation. \nSpecifically, the low crystallinity green bottle neck was 1.4- (from 12.6 \nto 17.2 μ g\nproducts\n/mm\n2\nchip\n) and 1.6-fold (from 0.44 to 0.71 μ g\nproducts\n/ \nmm\n2\nchip\n) more degraded than the respective transparent compartment \nfrom LCC\nICCG \nand Dm PETase, respectively. Apart from this, the green \nbody part was hydrolyzed by Dm PETase 6.4 times more (from 1 to \n6 ng\nproducts\n/mm\n2\nchip\n) than the transparent one. \nHowever, the overall degradation yields were low even for the low \ncrystallinity compartments, resulting in only 1 – 2% degradation. Apart \nfrom crystallinity degree, the crystalline morphology can also be a sig -\nnificant factor in thermally crystallized PET, as it is the unstretched PET \nbottle neck crystallization temperature prior to blow-molding affects \nspherulites size and number. In samples of equivalent low crystallinity \nvalues, larger spherulites offer greater geometric impedance to mass \ntransfer phenomena, something that is observed in PET oxygen perme -\nability studies for x\nc \n< 20 – 30% [49] . For the stretched and heat parts of \nthe bottle (shoulder, body, bottom) strain-induced crystallization has \nhappened during the stretch-blow molding, and the polymer chains are \nrearranged in parallel being closely packed affecting thus enzyme ’ s \naccessibility to the hydrolysable bonds. Furthermore, even though both \nenzymes degraded the crystalline parts of the bottles to the same extent, \nthe yields did crystalline morphology of the bottles. \n3.4.2. DmPETase activity is affected less by crystallinity increase compared \nto LCC\nICCG \nTo investigate the effect of material morphology and crystallinity on \nenzyme activity, a subsequent investigation was performed by milling \nthe bottles into powder and comparing with other PET materials of \nvariable crystallinities, ranging from amorphous (7%) to semi- \ncrystalline (41%), most of which are involved in bottle production. \nWith milling, the different crystalline morphology of the stretched and \nunstretched bottle compartments obviously does not change, but the \nspecific surface area for enzymatic degradation increases. The degree of \ndepolymerization of each PET sample was assessed based on the amount \nof released water-soluble products released, as presented in Fig. 4 and  \nTable 2 ."}

As the crystallinity of PET increased from 6% \n(aPET) to 21% (tPET and gPET), there was a 2.2- and 3.3-fold reduction \nin hydrolysis products by Dm PETase and a 2.5- and 4.2-fold reduction by \nLCC\nICCG\n, respectively.

Nevertheless, the \ndepolymerization results of bPET, with a x\nc \nof 36%, contradict this \ntrend, as despite its similar crystallinity to cPET ( x\nc \nof 40%), its degra -\ndation capacity dropped by 2- and 4-fold by Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG\n, \nrespectively. This outcome could be attributed to various material \nproperties, such as the increased hygroscopicity and moisture absorp -\ntion of cPET (according to the material datasheet), which potentially \nfacilitated the diffusion of the enzymatic solution through cPET powder \nparticles during the reaction, leading to more efficient degradation. \nEmphasizing on post-consumer bottles, both Dm PETase and LCC\nICCG \ndemonstrated efficient degradation with 3 – 5% and 10 – 15% degradation \nyields, respectively, indicating that milling of the bottles, even without \nquenching, significantly enhances enzymatic degradation performance, \ndue to the increase of the available surface area. Grinding of transparent \nand green bottle enhanced degradation by Dm PETase by 93- and 35-fold \nrespectively, while LCC\nICCG \nbreakdown action was increased by 10- and \n5-fold respectively, comparing to the sum of the hole-punched samples \nfrom various bottle compartments. In contrast to the bottle pieces case \nstudy, where the green bottle appeared more susceptible to biodegra -\ndation, the results from the powder hydrolysis suggested that the \ntransparent bottle was degraded about 1.5-fold more, compared to green \nbottle powder, by both enzymes. It is possible that colorants, wax dis -\npersants, and copolymer additives, which are perceptible in colored PET \n[50] , might be released with grinding, possibly impeding enzymatic \naction. \nFocusing more on the enzymatic perspective, Fig. 5 highlights that \nthe degrading activity of Dm PETase on amorphous PET is approximately \n3.5-fold lower than that of LCC\nICCG\n. However, LCC\nICCG \ndisplays 3.0 and \n2.5 times more efficient enzymatic degradation of transparent and green \nPET bottle powders, respectively.

These obser -\nvations suggest that LCC\nICCG \nexhibits stronger PET-degrading activity \nthan Dm PETase in these samples, but also reveal an underlying trend \nbetween the correlation of enzymes ’ PET activity. Specifically, the ratio \nof LCC\nICCG \nto Dm PETase hydrolysis products decreases with increasing \ncrystallinity, indicating that LCC\nICCG \nPET-degrading activity is strongly \nimpacted by crystallinity alteration, whereas Dm PETase exhibits less \nsensitivity to this change. Indeed, this trend is confirmed as notably both \nPET-hydrolases have the same degrading efficiency towards the most \ncrystalline PET sample (cPET-40%)."}

Results and discussion \n3.1. PET hydrolytic enzymes play a more important role than anchoring \nproteins \nOuter membrane proteins, lipoproteins, fimbria proteins, and \nflagellar proteins have been widely utilized as effective anchoring pro -\nteins in bacterial surface-display construction [21] . However, to our \nknowledge, few previous studies investigated how the choice of anchor \nprotein affect the activity of the PET hydrolase [22] . Theoretically, the \nsize and structure of target proteins displayed by different anchoring \nproteins should vary greatly. Therefore, we selected three commonly \nused but structurally diverse anchor proteins, including pGSA (a kind of \nGram-positive bacteria outer membrane protein), inaXN (ice nucleation \nprotein), and estA (outer membrane esterase autotransporter, type 5 \nsecretion systems), and the differences between them can be found in \nthe paper published [23] . We fused IS PETase with above three anchoring \nproteins to study the effect of anchoring protein on surface-display \nperformance. It is worth noting that two G4S flexible peptides \n(GGGGSGGGGS) [24] ( Fig. 1 A) were used to connect the anchoring \nproteins and target affinity proteins during the construction process, \nbecause the absence of flexible peptides could affect the display effect, \nsuch as estA. Via the MD simulation, the G4S flexible peptides showed \nhigh flexibility, and no binding or entanglement occurred between the \nanchoring protein and PETase. ( Fig. 1 D). \nPETase can hydrolyze pNPB to p-nitrophenol and butyric acid, which \np-nitrophenol has a strong absorption peak at 405 nm [25] . Under in -\ncubation temperatures of 37 ℃ , 50 ℃ , and 72 ℃ , the enzyme activity \nlevels of pGSA-PETase were 3.54%, 3.8%, and 10.8% higher than \ninaXN-PETase, respectively ( Fig. 1 B). Similarly, compared to \nestA-PETase, pGSA-PETase was found little higher under the same in -\ncubation temperatures. We surmised that this advantage of \npGSA-PETase may be due to the following reasons: 1. smaller interfer -\nence between the anchor and passenger proteins; 2. codon advantage; 3. \nshorter length of the fusion protein. \nLike the enzyme activity, it was observed that pGSA-PETase exhibi -\nted higher PET hydrolysis rates (72 h, 200 mesh) in comparison to \ninaXN-PETase and estA-pGSA at all tested temperatures. Specifically, \nthe hydrolysis rates of pGSA-PETase were 3.5%, 7.6%, 6.6% and 7.1%, \n6.2%, 9.9% higher than inaXN-PETase and estA-pGSA at 37 ℃ , 50 ℃ , \nand 72 ℃ , respectively ( Fig. 1 C). However, even with the selection of \nsignificantly different anchoring proteins, the variations in hydrolytic \ncapacity among them did not exceed 10%. The strong expression of the \ntarget protein driven by the T7 promoter under IPTG induction [26] may \npotentially mask the differences in the surface-display ability of the \ntarget protein to some extent. So, the anchor protein type is not the main \nconsideration on PET hydrolysis by bacterial surface-display. Although \nthe overall improvement is not significant, using pGSA as an anchored \nprotein for PET hydrolyzing in this study was a better choice based on \nabove result. At 50 ℃ and 72 ℃ , the bacteria are unable to survive, but \nit does not affect the activity of the enzyme [27] . This is also one of the \nadvantages of surface-displayed engineered bacteria, as there is no need \nfor cell lysis to release the enzyme. Here, the bacterial cells serve as the \nbiological carriers of the enzyme, and the advantage lies in the rapid \nproliferation of bacteria. Compared to non-biological materials, it \neliminates the need for material synthesis and immobilization processes. \nWith pGSA as the priority anchoring protein, we systematically \ninvestigated four PET hydrolases, including IS PETase, a newly discov -\nered novel carboxylic ester hydrolase PE-H from P. aestusnigri [28] , and \ntwo mutants (FAST-PETase [29] :five mutations in IS PETase; LCC-ICCG \n[9] : four mutations in leaf-branch compost cutinase). We chose the \noptimal temperatures reported of these enzymes for comparison, and \nthese temperatures were also used in the anchoring protein study above. \nThe enzyme activity of these PET hydrolases varied greatly at different \ntemperatures. At 37 ℃ , there was an evident peak in the relative enzyme \nactivity of pGSA-PETase ( Fig. 1 E). Moving onto a slightly higher tem -\nperature of 50 ℃ , pGSA-FAST exhibited the greatest relative enzyme \nactivity. At 72 ℃ , pGSA-ICCG demonstrated the highest enzyme activ -\nity. Overall, the PET hydrolysis enzymes displayed were biologically \nfunctional and pGSA-FAST exhibited the highest enzyme activity at \n50 ℃ . \nHowever, relying solely on enzyme activity was insufficient to make \na comprehensive comparison of the PET hydrolysis capability of these \nfour surface-displayed E. coli . So, we used 4 g PET powder (200 mesh) as \nthe substrate for hydrolysis. Due to slower hydrolysis performance at \n37\n◦\nC, we extended the reaction time to 72 h, whereas at other tem -\nperatures, hydrolysis was still conducted for 24 h. Compared with the \nun-anchoring FAST-PETase, the pGSA-FAST-PETase surface-displayed \nbacteria actually improved the hydrolysis rate of PET powder ( Fig. 1 F)."}

This suggests that it is not \nsufficient to consider only hydrogen bonding when optimizing the \nbinding between substrate and hydrolase, and other forces play a non- \nnegligible role in many cases [30] . \nDue to the complexity of bacterial membrane structure, proteins \nsurface-displayed on bacterial outer membrane involves complex pro -\ntein transport and transmembrane processes. Although these anchoring \nproteins have been demonstrated to be capable of displaying on surface \ntheoretically, reasonable verification is still required for the surface- \ndisplay of PET hydrolases. Here, three techniques and methods were \nused to demonstrate the successful display of FAST-PETase on the \nsurface of E. coli . Firstly, we conducted a double-chamber experiment, \nwherein we placed a 0.22 µ m semipermeable membrane between two \nculture flasks connected to each other (SI Fig. S9 ). This device prevented \nthe bacterial cells from penetrating the membrane but facilitated the \nprotein molecule transportation, which was similar to the principle of \ndialysis. After a 72 h hydrolysis, the weight loss rate of PET particles was \nless than 2% (SI Fig. S13 ), demonstrating that PET plastics were mainly \nhydrolyzed by the FAST-PETase on the bacterial outer membrane, and \nthe hydrolysis of PET showed a strong reliance on physical contact to \nsurface-displayed bacteria. Secondly, we used enzyme-linked immuno -\nmagnetic bead precipitation, which the His-tagged magnetic bead \nFig. 2. The proof for FAST-PETase successfully displaying on the surface of E. coli.

Han et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nJournal of Hazardous Materials 461 (2024) 132632\n7\nantibody was employed to bind with the His tag at pGSA-FAST-PETase \nC-terminal. After magnetic absorption, it was observed that pGSA- \nFAST-PETase medium became clear but the intracellular expression \nnot (Fig. 2A). The OD\n600 \nof surface-displayed bacteria decreased from an \ninitial value of 1.0–0.45, while the intracellular expression bacteria \n(pET30a-FAST-PETase) remained at around 0.98. Finally, we validated \nthat the hydrolysis activity was mainly exerted by the protein anchored \non the outer membrane through extracting the membrane protein of \nsurface-displayed E. Coli. Without the pGSA anchoring, the enzyme ac -\ntivity extracted from pET30a-FAST-PETase E. Coli membrane protein \nwas substantially lower compared to pGSA-FAST-PETase, accounting for \nonly 5.4% of the latter (Fig. 2B). Based on the above-mentioned three \nexperiments, it can be unequivocally confirmed that FAST-PETase has \nbeen successfully anchored onto the outer membrane of the carrier cell. \n3.2. The protein structure of PET hydrolases determines their function and \nstability \nIn this study, we used the original ISPETase, FAST-PETase, PE-H, and \na mutant of leaf-branch compost cutinase known as ICCG. Considering \nthe fact that these enzymes have proven their ability to efficiently break \ndown PET, it is logical to assume that they possess certain structural \nsimilarities. At first, we aligned the amino acid sequences of these four \nenzymes and found that although they originated from different mi -\ncroorganisms and enzyme classifications, they shared a relatively high \ndegree of amino acid similarity (~ 50% identity) and possessed the same \ncatalytic triad (the exception of the S160A in ICCG) (SI Fig. S12). PE-H \nshowed the greatest sequence difference from the other three, but even \nso, it shared more than 45% sequence homology with the PET hydro -\nlases from S. viridis, Thermobifida sp. and I. sakaiensis[28]. Using MEME \n[31], all these four enzymes possessed the same conserved domains and \nthe conserved domain positions (Fig. 2D). This may imply that the \nproteins with PET-hydrolyzing capability should exhibit similar or \nidentical structures. However, the primary and secondary structures of \nproteins alone are not enough to explain their functional similarities and \ndifferences. Subsequently, we compared the crystal structures of these \nfour proteins. Through structural overlay analysis, FAST-PETase \nexhibited an RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) value of just 0.22 Å \ncompared to ISPETase (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the RMSD values for ICCG \nand PE-H (compared to ISPETase) were 1.41 Å and 1.88 Å, respectively, \nconforming well with the findings of the amino acid sequence analysis. \nAdditionally, their structural similarities (TM score) were all greater \nthan 0.9 (Fig. 2F), indicating a very high degree of structural similarity. \nAfter superimposing their protein structures, we observed that dispar -\nities in structure were predominantly limited to the disordered curves \n(Fig. 2E), while the alpha helices and beta sheets exhibited striking \noverlapping, especially for the catalytic triad. These findings suggested \nthat even though these four proteins had the same structure, we may \nhave mislabeled them for different classes. Therefore, we expanded the \nscope of our protein structure comparison. \nWe screened 41 enzymes capable of hydrolyzing or degrading PET \nfrom the PDB database with available crystal structures, covering almost \nall of the PET hydrolyzing enzymes (Table 1). Because the structural \ndifferences between mutant proteins and their wild-type counterparts \nwere relatively small, we only analyzed the structures of the wild-type \nproteins and ignored the structural information of the mutants. Based \non EC classification and original literature descriptions, the 41 hydro -\nlyzing enzymes were mainly classified into seven categories: ISPETase \n(the benchmark), cutinase, esterase, LCC, PEH (PET hydrolase), TfCut, \nand potential proteins capable of hydrolyzing PEH, which almost \ncovered all reported PET-degrading enzyme types. USalign[19] (a new \nstructure alignment algorithm) was used to compare the protein struc -\ntures, with higher TM scores indicating more similar structures. Sur -\nprisingly, using ISPETase as a benchmark, 36 of the 41 PDB structures \nhad a TM value above 0.9 (Table 1 Structure 1), while the other five \nstructures had much larger differences (TM values below 0.7), which \nthese five proteins could be further classified into two types according to \ntheir similarity. In other words, only three types of protein structures \nwere found from the PET-degrading enzymes, with ISPETase as the main \nrepresentative (Table 1 Structure 1), and the other two types (Table 1 \nStructure 2 and 3) were significantly different from it with a low pro -\nportion. We overlaid these structures and found that the 36 proteins in \nStructures 1 were almost identical, with the PET-catalytic domain and \nthe main alpha helix and beta-sheet frameworks completely over -\nlapping, and the main differences were only found in the disordered \nprotein curves (Fig. 3A Structure 1). The overlap rates between these 3 \nstructure types were relatively low, and their catalytic structural do -\nmains were misaligned (Fig. 3A Structure 1 VS Structure 2 VS Structure \n3). Therefore, we question whether we have really discovered new \nPET-degrading enzymes? Here, we propose three structural types of \nPET-degrading enzymes: the main type represented by ISPETase, the \nsecond type represented by Fusarium oxysporum cutinase, and the third \none represented by Chloroflexus sp. MS-G cutinase. Furthermore, it is \nworth noting that the discovery of TfCut[32] could date back to 2013, \npre-dating the more recent discovery of ISPETase in 2016. We believe \nthat confusion in naming or classification may have negative affect on \nthe discovery of PET-degrading enzymes, and classification based purely \non amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence similarity perhaps have \ncertain errors. Classifying based on the similarity of protein crystal \nstructure is more scientific and practical. \nEnzymes can only function if a stable protein structure is maintained, \nbut as temperatures rising or other conditions changing, proteins will \nundergo inactivation and deformation, an important aspect of which is \nthe structural changes in proteins, especially backbone changes. Previ -\nous studies had shown that protein structural stability was the key to \nimprove PET hydrolysis temperature[9]. Fast-PETase was originally \ndesigned to improve the stability of ISPETase at high temperatures, as \nPET tended to be hydrolyzed at higher temperatures. However, the \noriginal paper did not perform molecular dynamics simulations, so we \naimed to reveal the high-temperature tolerance mechanism of these \nenzymes from the perspective of protein structural stability using mo -\nlecular dynamics simulation[33]. We chose two temperatures of 300 K \nand 330 K for a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, which covered \nthe optimal enzymatic activity temperature of these four enzymes \n(Fig. 3D). The simulation results accorded with the previous experi -\nmental data, FAST-PETase and ICCG exhibited better stability in protein \nbackbone at both temperatures with RMSD below 0.15 A, while ISPE -\nTase’s stability decreased rapid at high temperatures with a higher \nRMSD. Not surprisingly, PEH had the poorest stability (highest RMSD) at \nboth temperatures, which could explain why the hydrolytic activity of \nPEH decreases the fastest[34]. However, these results cannot explain \nwhy the hydrolytic activity of PEH is also lower than PETase at low \ntemperatures. Therefore, we analyzed the protein surface charge inter -\naction potential. ICCG, ISPETase and its derivatives FAST-PETase have \ncracks of about 5 Å at the triple catalytic site, while the catalytic groove \nof PEH is sealed by electrostatic potential energy (Fig. 3B). Experts \nbelieved that this cleft might be very important to accommodate crys -\ntalline semi-aromatic polyesters[35] and this may be an intrinsic reason \nfor poor hydrolytic activity of PEH. Additionally, PE-H has the highest \nself-aggregation tendency via hydrophobic interactions (the lower the \nDI, the less liable to aggregate) and the least surface charge, in other \nwords, FAST, ISPETase and ICCG are more stable than PE-H (Fig. 3C). \nThe enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET exhibited similar crystal \nstructures. Therefore, classification of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes should \nconsider their crystal structures, which may facilitate the discovery of \nnovel enzymes. In general, an excellent PET hydrolase should have \nrobust protein skeleton for heat resistance, sufficiently wide catalytic \ngroove to accommodate the PET chain, good affinity to the substrate \nPET, low self-aggregation tendency (less prone to intertwine between \nproteins) and reasonable surface charge to ensure its solubility in water, \nwhere computer-aided design can play an unexpected role. \nW.

Hydrolysis characteristics of FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli \nfor PET \nUtilizing pNPB as the substrate, FAST-PETase surface-displayed \nE. coli exhibited optimal enzymatic activity at 50 ℃ (100%). At a higher \ntemperature of 60 ℃ , the activity of FAST-PETase surface-displayed \nE. coli decreased to only 40% of its maximum activity, while the enzyme \nmaintained a high activity of 71.2% at 42 ℃ ( Fig. 4 A). These findings \nsuggest that FAST-PETase needs a specific temperature to exert its \nmaximum hydrolytic activity and high temperature could weaken its \nactivity quickly. FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli showed the \nhighest activity at pH 8.5, with more than 80% activity remaining at pH \n8 and 9 ( Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, its hydrolytic activity at pH 6.0 was \nonly 18.3%, which indicated that FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli \nwas better adapted to alkaline conditions. In practical catalytic re -\nactions, different metal cations might be present in the solution, and \nthey could have certain impacts on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. \nUnder the condition of additional 10 mM ion, we detected that Na\n+\n, K\n+\n, \nand Ca\n2 +\ncould activate FAST-PETase with a maximum activation of \n123.2% ( Fig. 4 C).

Based on our study, K\n+\nand Na\n+\nions \nmay have the same effect of Ca\n2 +\n. Although no direct metal-binding sites \nwere identified in the crystal structures of these enzymes, some \nside-chain amino acids might possess potential for metal binding [9] . By \ncontrast, Mg\n2 +\n, Cu\n2 +\n, and Ni\n2 +\nhad little effect on the enzymatic activity \nof pGSA-FAST-PETase. Mn\n2 +\nexhibited a certain inhibitory effect, but its \nresidual activity was still maintained at a level of 89.4%, indicating that \npGSA-FAST-PETase had good tolerance to most common metal ions. \nHowever, Fe\n3 +\nalmost completely inhibited the activity of \npGSA-FAST-PETase (enzyme activity dropped to 3.9%), which may be \ncaused by protein denaturation induced by Fe\n3 +\n. \nUsing self-purchased amorphous PET powder (200 mesh) as the \nsubstrate, we measured the weight loss of PET powder after hydrolysis \nfor 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days. As shown in Fig. 4 D, after 1 day of \nhydrolysis by FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli, the weight loss of \nPET powder reached to 54.7%. Subsequently, PET hydrolysis became \nslow, and the hydrolysis rate only reached to 62.1% after 15 days. The \nhydrolysis rate remained stable from the 3rd day, and this might be \ndirectly related to the decrease in enzyme activity and the difficulty of \nhydrolyzing the PET-resistant part. Although FAST-PETase has \nimproved its hydrolysis ability at high temperatures, future research \nshould put more effort into how to improve its long-term thermal sta -\nbility via amino acid mutations. To the best of our knowledge, how to \nshorten the length of the protein while ensuring the hydrolytic activity \nof PET may be a solution. \nIn previous studies, we found that grinding PET plastic could greatly \nenhance its hydrolysis efficiency. Therefore, we believed that there was \na certain relationship between the hydrolysis of PET and its particle size. \nWe measured the weight loss of different sized PET powders (50, 200, \n500, 1000, 2000 mesh) using surface-displayed E. coli ( Fig. 4 E). Under \nthe same hydrolysis temperature (50 ℃ , 24 h), the weight loss of PET \npowder with 50 mesh was only 34.1%, while it reached around 50% for \nthe PET powder of 200 mesh. As the particle size of PET powder \ndecreased, the hydrolysis rate by pGSA-FAST-PETase increased clearly \nand the hydrolysis rate of PET powder with 2000 mesh could reach up to \n68.4%. The reason may be that PET powder with smaller particle sizes \nhave larger specific surface areas. When hydrolyzed by FAST-PETase \nsurface-displayed E. coli , the powder with a larger specific surface area \nhas more chance to contact with bacterial surface, resulting in a higher \nhydrolysis level [37] . \nGenerally, the hydrolysis of PET is closely related to its crystallinity, \nwith higher crystallinity resulting in poorer hydrolysis efficiency [29] . \nUnlike plastic products thermoformed, PET water bottles are produced \nthrough blow molding, which leads to a high degree of crystallization \n( > 25%) during the expansion process for most bottles [38] .

We cut these regions \nof PET bottle out, ground them (200 mesh), and treated them with \nFAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli for 24 h at 50\n◦\nC. The results \nshowed that the hydrolysis rate of the bottle neck reached to 52.9%, \nwhile the bottle base center was 31.4% ( Fig. 4 F). However, the hydro -\nlysis rate in the bottle body was only 10.2%. These results indicated that \nplastic crystallinity could affect the hydrolysis of PET, with higher \ncrystallinity leading to poorer hydrolysis efficiency. It has been pro -\nposed that higher temperatures may facilitate the hydrolysis of PET, \nbecause PET will undergo glass transition at 70 ℃ [39] . However, after \ncareful comparison, it has been established that FAST-PETase exhibits \nthe efficient hydrolysis capacity at 50 ℃ . This evidence suggested that \nsimply elevating hydrolysis temperature might not be the optimal so -\nlution, and a more effective approach would be to design enzymes with \nappropriate structural characteristics. \n3.4. The change of PET surface morphology and properties after \nhydrolysis \nBy surface-displayed E. coli hydrolysis, the main products of PET \nwere MHET, TPA, and BHET (SI Fig. S14 A). MHET is the main product \nin the first step of PET hydrolysis and will be further hydrolyzed to TPA, \nwhile BHET is the by-product ( Fig. 4 G). Because BHET is solely found at \nthe end of hydrolyzed polymer chains, its production yield is limited \n[14] . From a comprehensive view of the reaction process, equilibrium \nwas reached at approximately 21 h after hydrolysis initiation, and the \naccumulation amount of MHET stabilized at around 18 h. Combined \nwith the enzymatic activity findings, the reduced hydrolysis of PET \ncould be attributed to two factors: a decline in enzyme activity, as well \nas a possible decrease in mass transfer rate that due to product accu -\nmulation. After 24 h of hydrolysis by FAST-PETase surface-displayed \nE. coli , 250 mg PET powder produced about 8.5 mM MHET and 1.6 mM \nTPA ( Fig. 5 A), which FAST-PETase exhibited some ability to hydrolyze \nMHET to TPA. \nIn order to obtain more intuitive evidence, we studied the changes of \nPET plastic after hydrolysis. SEM directly observed the morphological \nchanges of PET plastics, which proved the hydrolysis and erosion of PET \nplastics by surface-displayed bacteria. SEM images of PET powder taken \nbefore hydrolysis showed a relatively smooth surface, while the surface \nbecame rough and pocked with numerous small pores after the hydro -\nlysis of surface engineered E. coli ( Fig. 5 B). After hydrolysis, the PET \npowder became very fragmented, as a result, decreased in weight. \nFTIR is a valuable technique for monitoring the chemical bond \ncleavage and formation of functional groups in PET molecular chains. \nFurther analysis using FITR indicated that hydrolysis promoted the \noxidation of PET materials, resulting in a significant increase of oxygen- \ncontaining groups, with the most typical example being the more pro -\nnounced peak in the C –\n–\nO absorption peak at 1713 cm-1 ( Fig. 5 C). \nMoreover, as the reaction proceeding, the relative intensity of the \nfreestanding hydroxyl group at 3540 cm-1 weakened, indicating further \noxidation of hydroxyl structures into acid and ester compounds might \noccur. These results are consistent with subsequent XPS analysis. \nBy observing the changes in the C1s and O1s spectral peaks of XPS, \nthe types of surface functional groups in PET can be determined. In XPS \nanalysis, the C1s spectrum and O1s spectrum primarily reflects the \nchemical state and presence of carbon elements and oxygen elements, \nrespectively, and the difference of PET hydrolysis was mainly in O1s. \nThe peaks of high-resolution XPS-O1s spectra at 531.73 eV and \n533.34 eV could be attributed to C –\n–\nO and C-O, which represented the \nester groups in PET. After hydrolysis of PET, the relative content of C –\n–\nO \nincreased from 52.89% to 63.60%, while the relative content of C-O \nbecame 36.4% ( Fig. 5 D), which showed that surface-displayed engi -\nneered bacteria participated in the oxidation of PET plastic and changed \nPET surface functional groups. We believe this is due to the hydrolysis of \nPET plastic, where more long chains are hydrolyzed into short chains, \nexposing carbonyl end groups. Additionally, combined with the results \nof SEM analysis, the surface of PET plastic becomes rough, leading to an \nincrease in the proportion of carbonyl end groups. \n3.5. The recombinant proteins C-terminal has an effect on PET hydrolysis \nThe main hydrolysis product of PET by FAST-PETase is MHET, and \ncomplete hydrolysis requires cooperative action between PETase and \nMHETase. Thus, we planned to co-display both MHETase and FAST- \nPETase through flexible peptide linkages (G4S), co-anchoring them in \nthe outer membrane of E. coli ( Fig. 5 E). Since the two-enzyme system \ninvolved the question of which enzyme was more suitable at the C-ter -\nminal (N-terminal is inside the membrane, C-terminal is outside), so the \neffect of the recombinant protein C-terminal region on PET hydrolysis \nwas assessed. Regardless of which enzyme was located at the C-terminal, \nthe two-enzyme system showed enhanced PET hydrolysis performance \n( Fig. 5 F and Fig. 4 D), suggesting that MHETase could break the hydro -\nlysis decline caused by substrate MHET accumulation. Interestingly, the \nPET hydrolytic rate of the C-terminal pGSA-MHETase-g4s-FAST-PETase \n(84.6%) was slightly higher than the N-terminal one (pGSA-FAST- \nPETase-g4s-MHETase, 80.8%) after 24 h ( Fig. 5 F). Given that enzyme \ncontact was essential for the hydrolysis of PET, the C-terminal end of \nrecombinant protein offered a distinct advantage. And it also confirmed \nour previous hypothesis that substrate accumulation could affect the \nhydrolysis ability. Although it had been shown that MHETase and \nPETase could improve the hydrolysis efficiency of PET by cooperating \nwith each other [40] , our study provided an new idea to achieve the \ncoexistence of the two enzymes by the mean of surface co-display. It is \nworth mentioning that it has been found that MHETase has an \nexo-PETase activity, allowing hydrolysis PET at the terminal ester \ngroups [41] , which further enhanced the hydrolysis ability. \nIn addition to the difference in hydrolysis capacity, whether the \nhydrolyzed products are also different. So, we examined whether the \nhydrolysis products of the two recombinant proteins differed in PET \nhydrolysis (250 mg). Like the FAST-PETase surface-display system, both \nco-display fusion proteins generated MHET, TPA and BHET (SI Fig. S14 \nB). However, there was a significant difference in the production of TPA \nand MHET between the two recombinant proteins. Specifically, C ter -\nminal pGSA-MHETase-g4s-FAST-PETase yielded less TPA (6.9 mM TPA, \n4.2 mM MHET) ( Fig. 5 G). By contrast, pGSA-FAST-PETase-g4s- \nMHETase produced higher ratio of TPA (7.0 TPA mM and 3.3 mM \nMHET) ( Fig. 5 H). These results indicated that the C-terminal of the fused \nprotein was the most favorable position, where FAST-PETase located at \nthe C-terminal could lead to a higher degree of PET hydrolysis, while \nMEHTase located at the C-terminal resulted in more MHET hydrolysis. \nTo gain more insight, it would be useful to explore the structural changes \nor conformational dynamics of fusion proteins when they are at different \nends, and AlphaFold2 is helpful to gain the fusion proteins [42] . How -\never, in general, for faster PET hydrolysis, FAST-PETase is more suitable \nat the C-terminal of co-display system. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nYing Zhang: Writing – review & editing (equal).

The techniques discussed in the following section are biophysical methods com-\nmonly employed to investigate interface-related problems, enabling the determination of binding \nafﬁnities, surface interactions, protein mobility, and the kinetics of the process. \nLangmuir isotherms are commonly used to determine protein binding to insoluble substrates. \nThis model \ndescribes the adsorption of protein molecules onto a homogeneous solid substrate \nsurface with identical binding sites, assuming independent protein binding, monolayer formation, \nand reversible binding. Despite their simplicity, the Langmuir isotherms are often overlooked in \nPET hydrolase studies.

The binding process was reasonably described by a Langmuir \nisot\nherm, indicating a strong afﬁnity for the PET substrate, with dissociation constants consis-\ntently below 150 nM. The saturated substrate coverage for all three enzymes roughly \ncorresponded to a monolayer on the PET surface. No speciﬁc ligand binding contributions in \nthe active site were identiﬁed, suggesting that adsorption is predominantly driven by nonspeciﬁc \ninteractions, unlike enzymes naturally evolved to degrade insoluble polymers. However, a corre-\nlation was observed between the progression of enzymatic hydrolysis and increased binding\n712 Trends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8\n(Xc) \ncapacity, likely due to surface modiﬁcations of the PET polymer over time. In another study, \nLangmuir isotherms identiﬁed that fusing CBMs to a variant of LCC improved the afﬁnity of the en-\nzyme to PET [72]. Binding isotherms, along with zeta potential measurements that quantify the \nelectrical \ncharge on the surface of particles such as proteins in a liquid, helped explain the differ-\nences in activity as a function of salt concentration for several HiC homologs. \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nAn inverse Michaelis–Menten approach has been used to assess the kinetics of PET hydrolases \nand their interaction with the PET surface. Besides the kinetic parameters, this approach provides \nthe number of attack sites on the PET surface. Speciﬁcally, one kinetic data set is collected using \nthe conventional method with the substrate in excess, while another is collected in an inverse con-\ncentration regime with enzyme in excess (Figure 3A) [9]. This approach has been applied using either \nPET p\nowder or ﬁlm of varying crystallinity, yielding substrate afﬁnity, turnover rate, catalytic efﬁciency, \nand the ability to identify attack sites on PET, thereby facilitating the identiﬁcation of rate-limiting steps \n[9,15,88–91]. For example, it was used to compare an engineered PET hydrolase, TurboPETase, \nwith other \nPET hydrolases. It was suggested that TurboPETase’s enhanced depolymerization per-\nformance may, at least in part, be due to its improved ability to target a broader range of speciﬁc a t -\ntack sites that can be hydrolyzed [88].

CTAB consistently reduced the inter-\naction \nstrength, while its effect on enzymatic turnover exhibited a strong biphasic response. Initially, \nincreasing the concentration of CTAB enhanced turnover, but beyond a certain point, the turnover \nwas suppressed. This correlation reﬂects the Sabatier principle [9].\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), combined with thermokinetic models, was employed to \nconduct a detailed analysis of the degradation process of PET nanoparticles by TfC2 [92]. An in-\nv\nerse Michaelis–Menten-based model was used for the data analysis. The results determined \nthat about 95% of the heat produced during PET degradation can be attributed to the heat of re-\naction, while only about 5% was due to the heat of adsorption. \nThe effect of surface mutations on a PET hydrolase, PET2, identiﬁed from a metagenome library, \nwas \ninvestigated using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This tech-\nnique enables single-molecule imaging, allowing for the tracking of binding rate constants \n(Figure 3B). The most active mutant exhibited an increased binding rate constant, which was sug-\nges\nted to explain its higher activity compared with the WT enzyme [37]. In another study, TIRF \nmi\ncroscopy was combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) mi-\ncroscopy to examine how two green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP) labeled PET hydrolases, LCC \nand PES-H1 (aka PHL7), and their CBM fusion variants attach and detach from a PET surface. \nTIRF microscopy was optimized for measuring the on and off rates of the enzymes, while \nFRAP microscopy was used to assess the dynamic movement rates of proteins across the \nPET surface. The study showed that adsorption and desorption dominate over lateral diffusion \n[93]. Similarly, single-molecule binding dynamics of quantum dot-labeled IsPETase were studied \nus\ning TIRF microscopy. Speciﬁcally, the landing rate and the binding duration were measured. \nThe binding durations were well described by a biexponential model, featuring a fast population \ninterpreted as active binding events and a slow population representing nonspeciﬁc binding inter-\nactions [94]. Additionally, a simpliﬁed form of TIRF microscopy was utilized to study enzyme den-\nsity \nand distribution on the PET surface, providing insights into the protein concentration-\ndependent activity reduction of IsPETase [95]. \nThe quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is a method that al-\nlows \nfor real-time monitoring of PET hydrolysis, enabling the determination of depolymerization \nkinetics. This was demonstrated for TfC2 and its mutants, where QCM-D was used to analyze \nthe degradation kinetics of PET spun-coated onto a gold sensor (Figure 3C), which revealed \ntwo \ndistinct phases: an ‘initial hydrolysis phase’ and a ‘fast hydrolysis phase’ [97]. Furthermore, \nearlier \nresearch employed QCM to evaluate the effects of fusing binding proteins including \nCBMs to a PET hydrolase on the hydrolysis kinetics [69]. \nThermal treatment of a WCCG variant of LCC was shown to enhance PET hydrolysis.

Untreated and thermally treated en-\nzyme were applied to the AFM tip and approached a PET ﬁlm. Thermally treated enzyme \nshowed higher adhesion force than the untreated one. It was hypothesized that thermal treat-\nment increases the hydrophobicity of the protein surface [89]. AFM-SMFS was also used to dem-\nonstrate \nthat hydrophobic anchor peptides promote adhesive interactions between HotPETase \nfused with different anchor peptides and the PET surface [14].\n714 Trends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nWe ﬁnd it important to note that the outcome of all the experimental methods described depends \non the properties of the PET substrate. The degree of crystallinity is crucial when assaying and \ncomparing the activity of PET hydrolases on insoluble PET, with enzymatic activity increasing \nwhen the crystallinity decreases [18,23,73,83]. However, crystallinity is an overall estimate and \ndoes \nnot reﬂect the speciﬁc properties of the PET surface where the PET hydrolases act. \nSome PET hydrolases create holes in the substrate, likely targeting amorphous areas of the sub-\nstrate surface [83].

By allowing precise control over variables like \nsurface morphology and molecular interactions, simulations can provide detailed insights into \nmechanistic relationships that are challenging to capture experimentally; however, they also \ncome with their own challenges, which are discussed later. While the docking and QM/MM sim-\nulations provide crucial insights into the processes within the active site (discussed earlier), they \nare not able to explain how the enzymes adsorb on the PET material and how PET reaches the \nactive site. These questions can be addressed by classical MD simulations where PET is modeled \nas a material in its amorphous, crystalline, or mixed amorphous/crystalline state (Figure 2) and the \nrespect\nive enzyme is placed above the material to monitor the adsorption process. \nIn the study by Sahihi et al., the adsorption of LCCICCG on amorphous PET consisting of PET-\n9mer chains at 65°C was simulated [100]. The enzyme was always positioned such that the ac-\ntive \nsite faced the PET material and was only about 5 Å away. Consequently, the enzyme always \nbound with the same area to the PET surface, and this interaction occurred rapidly and was me-\ndiated by hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and π–π interactions between PET chains and various \namino \nacid residues of the cutinase enzyme.

To further explore the role of speciﬁc a m i n o \na\ncids in PET interactions, surface residues were mutated to weaken PET binding, primarily re-\nplacing positively charged and polar residues with negatively charged ones or alanine \n(Figure 4C,D). In silico simulations of the resulting triple mutants guided the selection for in vitro \ntesting \nusing the inverse Michaelis –Menten approach, but the LCC mutant could not be \nexpressed despite mutations being distant from the active site. Meanwhile, the PES-H1 T11V/ \nS13A/S14A mutant exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced PET degradation activity.

While enzymes have evolved to effectively target nat-\nural substrates, the presence of these enzymes that can degrade PET is surprising at ﬁrst glance. \nHowever, upon closer examination, one ﬁnds that there are hydrolysable synthetic polymers like \nPET that share structural similarities, such as ester bonds, with natural polyesters like cutin, which \nare substrates for hydrolases. Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinase (TfC) was the ﬁrst PET-degrading en-\nzyme discovered, as described in 2005 [1]. \nSince then, a number of PET hydrolases have been identiﬁed and advanced [2], including the \nlea\nf compost cutinase (LCC) and polyester hydrolase I (PES-H1, also known as PHL7) which \nwere both derived from compost metagenome libraries in 2014 [3] and 2022 [4], respectively. \nLCC \nshows high activity against PET and exhibits cutinase-like properties, enabling the enzyme \nto break down polymer structures effectively. Building on this natural enzyme, the French \ncompany CARBIOS utilized the ICCG variant of LCC (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G) [5], en-\nab\nling them to successfully launch the ﬁrst enzymatic PET recycling demonstration plant in \n2021 with plans to open a larger facility with a recycling capacity of 130 tons per day in 2025 \n(https://www.carbios.com/en/enzymatic-recycling/ ). Although PES-H1 is somewhat less ac-\ntive \nthan LCC [6], it is of industrial interest, as well, as it demonstrates a broader substrate \nsp\neciﬁcity that could be enhanced further through a two-enzyme system, similar to that em-\nployed by Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bacterium can effectively metabolize PET using \nthe enzymes IsPETase and MHETase, which facilitate the complete degradation of PET into \nbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), ulti-\nmately producing the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) [7]. \nTable 1 summarizes key wild-type (WT) and mutant PET hydrolases, detailing their enzymatic \ncharac\nteristics on both amorphous and crystalline PET substrates, along with the temperatures \nat which these parameters were measured.

To address this, Arnal et al. developed a stan-\ndardized protocol for larger-scale studies, applying it to four PET hydrolases [16]. Their ﬁndings \nide\nntiﬁed that FAST-PETase and HotPETase are unsuitable for large-scale applications due to \nlow depolymerization rates, while PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y (PES-H1FY ) could be a promising candi-\ndate with 80% depolymerization upon further enzyme evolution. LCCICCG excelled, achieving \n98% PET conversion to TPA and EG in 24 h, and they improved its economic viability by reducing \nenzyme usage by a factor of 3 and lowering the reaction temperature from 72°C to 68°C. None-\ntheless, further optimization is crucial for enhancing the catalytic efﬁciency and environmental im-\npact of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, as current life cycle assessments show that enzymatic PET \nrecycling still lags behind virgin PET production in most categories [17]. Therefore, we will ﬁrst ex-\namine the individual steps of the catalytic cycle, which present several opportunities for enzyme \nimprovement, before focusing on the initial step: the adsorption of PET hydrolases onto the \nPET material.\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nThe catalytic cycle and potential intervention points for engineering PET hydrolases \nPET degradation by PET hydrolases can be considered as heterogeneous catalysis, w h e r e \nthe catalyst is in a different phase (here solution) than the substrate (here solid).

(i) Adsorption: the PET hydrolase must \nﬁrst \ncome into contact with the surface of PET; (ii) enzyme–substrate complex formation: a PET \nchain must enter into the active site of the enzyme and adopt a pose ready for the hydrolysis re-\naction to take place; (iii) catalytic action: the PET hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction by \ncleaving the ester bond(s) in the polymer chain; and (iv) product release: after the reaction, the \nproducts (e.g., shorter PET chains, BHET, MHET, TPA, and EG) must be released from the active \nsite of the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to be free for additional catalytic cycles.\nInsoluble substrates like PET present unique challenges for enzymes. Unlike soluble substrates \ntha\nt easily dissolve in water and are accessible to enzymes, insoluble substrates remain solid \nand often possess complex structures that enzymes must navigate. The enzymatic hydrolysis \nof PET primarily involves surface erosion, where the outer polymer layer is degraded to expose \ninner material. Due to the inability of water and enzyme molecules to penetrate the polymer’s \ncore, only a limited number of ester bonds are accessible for enzymatic action. Additionally, inter-\nfacial enzymes, such as PET hydrolases, must overcome attractive forces within the substrate \nmatrix to form a productive enzyme–substrate complex. \nBased on the PET hydrolase catalytic cycle, one can focus on one or more of the four major steps \nto in\ncrease its efﬁciency. Most approaches so far emphasize optimizing the second and third \nsteps, speciﬁcally the binding of PET in the active site and the catalytic reaction. It is important \nto consider the material properties of PET, a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with linear polymer \nstrands forming both amorphous and crystalline regions (Figure 2). The mobility of the PET chains \nis temper\nature-dependent, transitioning from rigidity below the glass transition temperature \n(Tg) t o ﬂexibility above it. The differs between the amorphous and rigid regions, as well as be-\ntween bulk PET and the surface, due to the plasticization effect of water [19–22]. Increased ﬂex-\nibility allows \nbetter access to ester bonds, enhancing enzymatic turnover [23]. Optimal PET \nbiodegradation therefore \noccurs at 68–72°C [5,19,22,24,25], necessitating high thermostability \nin PET \nhydrolases. The thermostability of enzymes can be improved by introducing covalent di-\nsulﬁde bridges, which resulted in increases in melting temperature (Tm) o f 2 0–30°C for various \nPET-degrading enzymes [26–28]. Techniques like directed evolution, machine learning (ML), \nand artiﬁcial \nintelligence (AI) have also been used to create thermostable enzyme variants, such\nGlossary \nAtomic force microscopy-single-\nmolecule force spectroscopy \n(AFM-SMFS): measures forces and \ninteractions at the level of individual \nmolecules using an AFM tip to apply \nforce to a single molecule; provides \ninformation on unfolding or binding \ninteractions. \nCarbohydrate-binding domain \n(CBM\n): a s p e c iﬁc structural region \nfound in certain proteins that enables \nthem to bind carbohydrates .\nCrystallinity level of structural \norder within a solid; impacts properties \nsuch as hardness, density, \ntransparency, and diffusion. \nFluorescence recovery after \npho\ntobleaching (FRAP) \nmicroscopy: quantitative imaging \ntechnique for studying the dynamics of \nﬂuorescently labeled molecules in tissue \nor cells; a speciﬁc region is \nphotobleached and the recovery of \nﬂuorescence is monitored to analyze \nmolecular diffusion. \nGlass transition temperature \ngradual and reversible change in \namorphous material domains from a \nhard, brittle ‘glassy’ state to a viscous or \nrubbery state as temperature increases. \nHamiltonian replica exchange \nmol\necular dynamics (HREMD): \ncomputational technique to enhance \nsampling in molecular dynamics \nsimulations; multiple system replicas are \ncreated with different Hamiltonians and \nexchanged periodically. \nHeterogeneous catalysis: process \nwher\ne the catalyst is in a different phase \nfrom the reactants. \nInverse Michaelis–Menten: a \nrec\niprocal form of the conventional \nMichaelis–Menten kinetics, where the \nconcentration of the enzyme exceeds \nthat of the substrate. \nIsothermal titration calorimetry \n(ITC\n): measures heat changes during a \nchemical reaction or binding event; \ndetermination of the thermodynamics of \ninteractions such as binding constants \nand enthalpy changes. \nLangmuir isotherms: describe the \nadso\nrption of molecules onto a solid \nsurface as a function of pressure, \nassuming uniform binding sites, where \nan occupied site cannot accommodate \nanother molecule. \nMolecular docking: prediction of the \npref\nerred orientation of one molecule \nwhen binding to another; binding afﬁnity \nis estimated using a scoring function.\n708 Trends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8\n(Xc): \n(Tg): \nTg \nas HotPETase and DuraPETase, which are both derived from the IsPETase [29,30].

This physical \naging b\negins above 72°C for amorphous PET in an aqueous environment [5]. Therefore, devel-\noping high\nly efﬁcient enzymes that can outperform this competing physical aging process is \nessential [20,21], a challenge addressed through PET hydrolase engineer ing. To this end, \nmany \nstudies investigated the interactions between PET and amino acids near the active \nsite, examining crystal structures of enzymes with PET analogs [6,35–41], as well as structures \nbased o\nn molecular docking [5,40,42–44], often followed by short MD simulations [6,45–49]. \nStu\ndies have replaced sterically demanding amino acids with smaller ones to widen the binding \ncleft of PET-degrading enzymes, enhancing activity due to improved accessibility [43,50–52]. \nHowever, \nsuch substitutions might lead to the loss of speciﬁc interactions with PET, weakening \nbinding. In fact, in one study, narrowing the binding site and introducing amino acids with \nstronger PET interactions has led to increased activity [49]. Increased aromaticity [50] and hy-\ndrophobicity \n[52,53] near the active site also positively inﬂuence activity. A conserved trypto-\nphan, \nknown as ‘wobbling ’ tryptophan, located at one end of the catalytic binding cleft, \nenhances PET binding through π–π interactions with the benzene ring and improves product \nrelease [40,54]. \nTo \ngain insights into the mechanistic details of the catalytic reaction beyond the assumptions de-\nrived from crysta\nl structures, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simula-\ntions were conducted, with the ﬁrst studies on enzymatic PET hydrolysis published in 2021 \n[55–57], followed by several other studies in subsequent years [58–61]. The mechanism consists \nof acylation, \nwhere the catalytic serine’s nucleophilicity is increased by proton transfer from the \nhistidine, allowing for an attack on the PET ester’s carbonyl and the subsequent cleavage of \nthe bond, and deacylation, where a water molecule attacks the acyl intermediate. Key mutations, \nsuch as the replacement of an isoleucine near the catalytic aspartate with alanine, resulted in a \nloss of activity, emphasizing the importance of nearby amino acids in stabilizing the catalytic as-\npartate [62]. A recent QM/MM study disclosed that the acylation process in LCC and PES-H1, \nalong with their \nmore active mutants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , involves two distinct conformations \nof the PET benzene ring that enhance π–π interactions with the ‘wobbling’ tryptophan residue \n[63]. For the high-activity variants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , a reduction of 2–5 kcal/mol in activa-\ntion free energy was observed compared with their respective WT enzyme and partially explains \ntheir increased activity. Alternative to molecular simulations, AI also offers promising avenues for \noptimizing the active sites of PET hydrolases; for example, a recent study utilized a diffusion \nmodel combined with a neural network approach to design tailor-made enzymes, speciﬁcally \ngenerating novel serine hydrolases for the hydrolysis of PET [64]. \nAttempts were also made to increase enzymatic efﬁciency by addressing the ﬁrst step of the cat-\nalytic cycle and \nmodifying the interactions between PET hydrolases and the PET material. How-\never, the collective ﬁndings from studies addressing these interactions indicate that this process \nis primarily nonspeciﬁc, which poses a challenge for enhancing enzymatic efﬁciency. In light of \nthis, no explicit PET recognition site has been identiﬁed so far, prompting efforts to modify PET \nsurface characteristics or fuse enzymes with binding domains to enhance adsorption [65]. For\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8709\n(Tm) \n(Xc) \nexample, carbohydrate-binding domains (CBMs), known for efﬁciently binding polymers like \nsynthetic plastics [66,67], have been fused terminally with PET-degrading enzymes [68–73]. \nThes\ne studies demonstrated that the impact of CBM fusion on activity depends on various pa-\nrameters such as the catalytic domain, linker type, substrate type, and substrate load. The fusion \nof small anchor peptides to HotPETase has yielded similar results as with CBMs [14]. Additionally, \nfusing \nhydrophobins or adding them as free molecules enhances PET degradation by PET hydro-\nlases [74–76]. Hydrophobins are small glycoproteins that modify the surface properties of hydro-\nphobic \nsubstrates like PET, increasing their hydrophilicity and facilitating enzyme adsorption from \nthe aqueous phase. This improved binding raises the local concentration of the enzyme on the \nsubstrate surface, enhances wettability, and promotes hydrolytic breakdown of PET [74–78]. \nAn innova\ntive approach for PET degradation involved codisplaying IsPETase and a hydrophobin \non yeast, signiﬁcantly increasing the degradation of highly crystalline PET compared with puriﬁed \nIsPETase [79]. Surfactants serve a similar function as hydrophobins, with their hydrophobic part \nbinding \nto PET, while the charged part mediates contact with the enzyme, as demonstrated for \nIsPETase [80] and TfC2 [81]. \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nTable 1.

For instance, Sagong \net al. identiﬁed a positive effect by introducing negative charges in surface regions away from the \ncatalytic center, while substitutions with negatively charged amino acids near the catalytic center \nresulted in reduced activity [82]. Jäckering et al. found that even substitutions involving only polar \nresidu\nes, rather than charged ones, on the protein surface far from the active site of PES-H1 sig-\nniﬁcantly reduced its activity [8].

As degradation in-\ncr\neases the number of negatively charged carboxylic groups on the PET surface, it becomes \nmore negative, repelling PES-H1 and resulting in crater formation rather than uniform degrada-\ntion. These observations are supported by different studies that indicated a positive impact of a \nmore neutral, hydrophobic enzyme surface on enzymatic activity [84–86]. However, enhancing \nPET \nadsorption does not always translate to increased PET hydrolase activity; in fact, improved \nactivity can sometimes be achieved by reducing adsorption, as seen in LCC, where a decreased \nbinding afﬁnity arises from cationic surfactants [9]. This observation aligns with the Sabatier prin-\nciple\n, which posits that there is an optimal binding afﬁnity for achieving the most effective enzy-\nmatic activity. If the binding is too strong, it can hinder the release of the reactants after catalysis \ntook place, reducing the catalytic turnover; conversely, if the binding is too weak, the catalyst may \nnot hold the reactants long enough for the reaction to occur. Thus, an intermediate binding \nstrength is ideal, as it maximizes catalytic efﬁciency by enabling enzymes to stabilize transition \nstates without obstructing product release [87].\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nTrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences \nFigure 1.

This study started with an in vitro analysis of eight CBMs for their PET binding afﬁnity.

The balance of hydrophobic to polar interactions at the CBM– \nPET interface differentiated high-afﬁnity binders, with BaCBM2 demonstrating an optimal ratio, \nfrom CBMs with lower afﬁnity [66]. \nConcluding remarks \nThe remarkable similarity between man-made plastics and natural polymers allows certain en-\nzymes, such as cutinases and other polyesterases, to effectively degrade plastics like PET. How-\never, the WT forms of these enzymes often lack the efﬁciency required for practical industrial \napplications. To rationally enhance their performance, a thorough understanding of the heteroge-\nneous catalytic process is essential, beginning with the adsorption of enzymes onto insoluble PET \nand culminating in product release. While many studies concentrate on elucidating the processes \nwithin the active sites of PET hydrolases, we advocate for increased research into the interactions \nbetween these enzymes and the PET material, both at the onset of degradation and during the \nprocess, particularly as PET undergoes structural and physicochemical changes due to short-\nened chains. As highlighted in this review, a diverse array of experimental and simulation tech-\nniques is available to advance our understanding in this area.

This effect was confirmed by physical \nenergy calculations, which suggest that temperature-dependent conformational changes of FAST-PETase \ndecrease the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G(stability)) and rigidify the enzyme at elevated temperatures \nenhancing stability. Looking forward, these findings might help guide the rational engineering of protein ther -\nmostability and contribute to our understanding of the thermal adaptation of thermophilic enzymes.\n1. Introduction\nTo achieve a circular economy, the ability to recycle the growing \namount of plastic waste is considered to be of high priority. [1] With PET \naccounting for around 12 % of the global solid waste volume (8 % by \nweight), the development of efficient and economical de- and repoly -\nmerization processes is therefore key. [2,3] One such PET depolymer -\nization strategy is the plastics ’ enzymatic hydrolysis, first reported in \n2005. [4,5] Although several enzymes with PET-hydrolyzing activities \nhave been identified, such as esterase, lipase and cutinase enzyme an -\nnotations, [6 – 9] expensive PET pretreatments are necessary to achieve \nacceptable depolymerizing activities with these promiscuous enzymes. \n[10 – 12] In 2016, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) was \nreported to be suitable for the operation at temperatures between 30 and \n50 \n◦\nC. [13] However, this enzyme was found to be poorly stable, with \nloss of activities after 24 hours incubation at 37 \n◦\nC. [14] Since PET \nbecomes more accessible near its glass transition temperature (65 – 75 \n◦\nC), [15] increasing T\nm \nand optimal operating temperature of Is PETase \nis desirable. Thus, several enzyme engineering strategies have been \napplied to optimize Is PETase ’ s utility by enhancing its thermostability, \nactivity and process conditions. [14,16 – 19] As a result, two stabilized \nvariants, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, were generated, which dis -\nplayed higher thermostability ( Δ T\nm \n10 and 30 \n◦\nC, respectively) and \nactivity at elevated temperatures ( > 60 \n◦\nC) but lower activity when mild \ntemperatures (30 – 50 \n◦\nC) were applied in depolymerization experiments. \n[14,16,20] Building on initial engineering attempts, Is PETase was \n* Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: ac4086@coventry.ac.uk (S.

[21,22] Control of sub -\nstrate conformation is achieved by the enzyme ’ s ability to induce \nreactive conformations of the PET substrate, which are not found when \nthe substrate is free in solution. This pre-organization at the active site, \nparticularly at 50\n◦\nC, optimizes substrate alignment in FAST-PETase ’ s \nactive site for catalysis. [21] Furthermore, transition state stabilization \nby FAST-PETase seems to be enhanced through an N233K mutation, \nwhich locally alters the depolymerases ’ structure increasing the basicity \nof Asp206 and strengthening the interaction with His237. This inter -\naction reduces the free energy barrier of the acylation stage \n(12.1 kcal/mol for FAST-PETase vs. 16.5 kcal/mol for wildtype Is PE -\nTase), ultimately accelerating the reaction rate. [22]\nIn addition to the improved transition state stabilization and the fine- \ntuned substrate binding conformation at 50 \n◦\nC, FAST-PETase exhibits a \nnotably improved thermal stability, with a T\nm \nof 67 \n◦\nC – an increase of \n18 \n◦\nC compared to WT-PETase ’ s T\nm \nof 49 \n◦\nC. Interestingly, unlike other \ndepolymerases, FAST-PETase performs best at 50\n◦\nC, rather than at \ntemperatures near the glass transition of PET (65 – 75 \n◦\nC). At 50\n◦\nC, FAST- \nPETase releases more than twice the amount of PET monomers (defined \nas the sum of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) \nterephthalate (MHET)) in 24 hours compared to ThermoPETase and \nDuraPETase. This improved performance at a specific temperature \nsuggests thermal adaptation of the biocatalyst, e.g., that the enzyme ’ s \ndynamic properties have been fine-tuned for efficient catalysis under \nspecific conditions. [23,24] In contrast, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase \nseem to rely on structural rigidity to maintain their function at higher \ntemperatures, prioritizing stability over dynamic flexibility.\nWhile hydrogen-bonding analysis of WT- and FAST-PETase crystal \nstructures indicate stabilizing effects of the introduced mutations \n(N233K/R224Q/S121E/D186H/R280A), [20] the influence of the mu -\ntations on protein dynamics is less well understood. Thus, we hypoth -\nesized that a more detailed analysis of the underlying protein dynamics \nwould provide insights into the molecular basis of FAST-PETase ’ s \nthermal adaptation whilst also enabling identification of novel hotspot \npositions for future enzyme engineering campaigns. In support of our \nhypothesis, Creveld et al. reported the ability to differentiate flexible \nregions which promote unfolding from those with catalytic importance \nby performing MD simulation of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi . Re -\ngions prone to unfolding were identified and proposed to serve as hot -\nspot areas for mutations. [25] Targeted mutagenesis of equivalent \nregions in the related Glomerella cingulate cutinase was later shown to \nimprove thermostability without influencing enzyme activity. [26] As \nthe discussed cutinases are part of α / β -hydrolase family (which com -\nprises all currently known PET-degrading enzymes), [27] following a \nsimilar approach to study unfolding regions in PETase seemed \npromising.\nHere, structural dynamics of WT- and FAST-PETase were studied by \nperforming both, CNAnalysis thermal unfolding simulations and MD \nsimulations at 30 and 50 \n◦\nC. The simulations indicated a temperature- \ninduced stabilization of FAST-PETase, which was confirmed by \nsecondary-structure analysis and free energy calculations.\n2. Results\n2.1. Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis)\nConstraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) can be used to identify \nvariations with regards to rigidity and flexibility at optimal tempera -\ntures of homologous mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. [28] Based \non graph theory, global and local flexibility/rigidity characteristics of \nproteins can be derived from single or multiple protein structures to \nsupport data-driven protein engineering with the aim to improve the \nproteins ’ thermal stability. [29]\nAs a first step to analyze flexibility/rigidity characteristics of the \nselected PETase variants, thermal unfolding simulations of a single \nconstraint network derived from crystal structures of WT-PETase and \nFAST-PETase (PDB accessions 5XJH and 7SH6, respectively) were per -\nformed utilizing the CNAnalysis Web Interface ( http://www.cnanalysis. \nde ). [30] A constraint network refers to a model for which the protein ’ s \natomic or residue-level structure is represented as a network of nodes \n(atoms or residues) connected by edges, which correspond to stabilizing \ninteractions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic in -\nteractions, and covalent bonds. Through thermal unfolding simulations, \na stability map can be derived from the constraint network, which en -\nables the visualization of how rigid contacts are distributed and how \nthey are impacted by thermal stress, providing insights into the protein ’ s \nstructural stability.\nWhen analyzing the stability maps of the PETase variants ( Fig. 1 ), it \nbecame evident that while rigid contacts in sequence region 55 – 60 of \nFAST-PETase were weakened compared to WT-PETase, all other \ndifferentiating regions exhibited stronger rigid contacts in FAST-PETase. \nFor instance, rigidity scores of contacts within region 110 – 155 around \nposition 121 (-1.8 vs \u0000 2.2) and region 200 – 230 around position 224 \n(-1.0 vs \u0000 1.5) increased for almost all contacts. Interestingly, the region \nsurrounding key mutation R280A in FAST-PETase, which alters the \nsubstrate binding site conformation to allow stronger substrate in -\nteractions, [18] also showed more rigid contacts (-0.8 vs \u0000 2.0) not seen \naround R180 in WT-PETase.\nTo further investigate the origin of thermal instability in WT- and \nFAST-PETase, unfolding nuclei frequencies were calculated using ther -\nmal unfolding simulations on an ensemble of networks (50 network \ntopologies). Unfolding nuclei are weak spots within the protein, which \ncan be considered as starting points of the thermal unfolding processes. \nResidues with higher unfolding nuclei frequencies represent weaker \nspots of the protein. Through the prediction of unfolding nuclei, at least \nfour potential hotspots for further stability engineering of WT- or FAST- \nPETase toward increased thermal adaptation were identified around \nresidues Y69, A82, V107 and M156 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Regions \naround substitutions S121E and D186H in FAST-PETase displayed a \nconsiderable drop in the unfolding nuclei frequencies compared to the \ncorresponding WT-PETase frequencies. Calculating the difference be -\ntween WT- and FAST-PETase frequencies mainly resulted in positive \nvalues indicating the overall reduction of unfolding nuclei.\n2.2. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations\nWhile CNAnalysis ’ s thermal unfolding simulations offered a \nstraightforward way to pinpoint protein regions influencing the rigidity \nand flexibility of WT- and FAST-PETase, molecular insights into residue \ninteractions and conformational changes cannot be identified by this \nmethodology. To confirm whether protein dynamics influences the \nPETase variants ’ thermal stability, we opted to carry out MD simulations \non both, the WT- and FAST-PETase, at 30\n◦\nC and 50\n◦\nC.\nAfter extensive three-step equilibration (constant volume and tem -\nperature (NVT) with restraints, constant pressure and temperature \n(NPT) with restraints, and free constant pressure and temperature \n(NPT)), five separate production runs were simulated for 100 nanosec -\nonds each.

Thus, hydrogen \nbonding analysis of these nine residues at 30 and 50 \n◦\nC was performed \nusing all WT- and FAST-PETase simulations trajectories. Changes of the \nmean bond distances between all identified hydrogen bonding atom \npairs were evaluated by calculating the differences between the 30 and \n50 \n◦\nC simulation systems ( Fig. 4 , Table 1 ). Overall, hydrogen bond \ndistances in FAST-PETase were found to exhibit stronger changes in \ndependence of temperature ( Δ bonding distance (50\n◦\nC – 30\n◦\nC) ranging \nfrom \u0000 1.022 to 0.766 nm) than those in WT-PETase ( Δ bonding distance \n(50\n◦\nC – 30\n◦\nC) ranging from \u0000 0.381 to 0.257 nm).\nHydrogen bonds involving the residues E121, H186, N172, S192, \nS193, E204, Q224, and K233 were analyzed and ranked by the differ -\nence ( Δ ) in their mean distances between 30 \n◦\nC and 50 \n◦\nC.

A \nnegative Δ value indicates that the hydrogen bond is stronger at higher \ntemperatures, while a positive Δ value indicates weakening. This table \nFig. 4.

Temperature was found to have a stronger impact on the hydrogen bond distances of FAST-PETase residues compared to those of WT-PETase as shown by \nthe broader distribution of the bonding distance deltas ( Δ ), calculated by subtracting the average bonding distance at 30 \n◦\nC from the 50 \n◦\nC values. This rear -\nrangement is further illustrated by the hydrogen-bonding network of residues S121E, W185, D186H, S193, and S214 in FAST-PETase, simulated at ( b ) 30 \n◦\nC and ( c ) \n50 \n◦\nC.\nP.

Although \nthese distances may appear quite large for hydrogen bonds (typically \naround 0.35 nm), it is important to note that hydrogen bonds break and \nform dynamically over the simulation trajectory. The hydrogen bonding \ndetection algorithm also considers bonds that are only rarely formed.\nTo further support our hypothesis of a temperature-induced stabili -\nzation of FAST-PETase, we calculated the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G \n(Stability)) using a set of physical energy functions (EvoEF1 [31] , \nEvoEF2 [32] and FoldX [33] ) by applying them on the last state of all \nsimulation replicates ( Fig. 5 & Supplementary Fig. S6 ). Consistently, all \nmethods captured a decreased stability of WT-PETase at higher tem -\nperature, while FAST-PETase was found to be stabilized at 50\n◦\nC \n( Supplementary Table S3 ).\n3. Discussion\nFAST-PETase, obtained through ML-assisted engineering, exhibits a \ntemperature-dependent dynamic behavior which is distinct from its \nparental enzyme. In this context, stability map analysis revealed that the \nstrength of rigid contacts is increased in FAST-PETase compared to the \nwildtype enzyme, while MD simulations identified instability regions \n(IS1-IS7) which display a different behavior as a function of the applied \ntemperature and the investigated variant. WT-PETase displayed signif -\nicantly higher RMSF values in instability regions at 50\n◦\nC compared to \n30\n◦\nC, indicative of increased flexibility at higher temperatures. Sur -\nprisingly, however, in FAST-PETase instability regions IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, \nIS5, and IS6 exhibited decreased flexibility at higher temperatures, \nsuggesting a temperature-induced stabilizing effect. Importantly, in this \ncontext, many mutations present in FAST-PETase are within or adjacent \nto the instability regions, suggesting a role in modulating the protein ’ s \nstability and dynamics through the reorganization of hydrogen bonding \npatterns potentially causing the thermal adaptation. For example, key \nmutations S121E and D186H impact the hydrogen bonds between res -\nidues E121 and W185, as well as H186 and S193, while the collapse of \nthese bonds at 50 \n◦\nC is compensated, inter alia , by the formation of \nstabilizing bonds between E121 and H186, as well as H186 and S214.\nThe putative temperature-induced stabilization of FAST-PETase is \nfurther supported by a secondary structure analysis: While WT-PETase \ndisplayed a lower proportion of α -helices and a higher proportion of \n3 – 10 helices at 50 \n◦\nC, FAST-PETase maintains its α -helix content even at \nelevated temperature. Notably, 3 – 10 helices are less abundant in nature \nand constitute only 10 – 15 % of all helices in protein secondary struc -\ntures. This type of helix is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds \nbetween the carbonyl group of amino acid n and the amide group of the \namino acid n + 3. However, the formation of van der Waals contacts and \nhydrogen bonds is less favorable in a 3 – 10 helix and in general, the \nα -helix is considered to be more stable. Notably, 3 – 10 helices are typi -\ncally observed as extensions of α -helices suggesting that the 3 – 10 helix \nmay serve as an intermediary conformation potentially playing a role in \nthe initiation of α -helix folding. [34] Elevated temperatures are known \nto induce such conformational changes in proteins, altering their sec -\nondary structure elements. Thus, the observed structural differences \nTable 1 \nMD simulation-based hydrogen bonding analysis of FAST-PETase.\nHydrogen Bond Mean Distance [nm] Δ [nm]\n30\n◦"}

In contrast to other engineered PETa -\nses, FAST-PETase does not exhibit this trade-off, as its stabilization is \nonly induced at elevated temperatures, allowing it to maintain both \nstability and activity across a broader temperature range. Notably, \nHOT-PETase, developed through directed evolution, has been reported \nto exhibit activity across an even wider temperature range than \nFAST-PETase and demonstrates best-in-class thermal stability, with a T\nm \nof 82.5 \n◦\nC. Similar to FAST-PETase, mutations in HOT-PETase appear to \nenhance structural stability while maintaining the flexibility of the \nactive site, a combination rarely seen in rigorously thermostabilized \nvariants. [41]\nLooking forward, the design of thermostable and active Is PETase \nvariants could be further guided by identifying naturally evolved ther -\nmophilic proteins and adapting their binding sites to fit the desired \nsubstrate through directed evolution.

Conclusion\nOur comparative MD-driven study of WT- and FAST-PETase sheds \nlight on the thermal adaptation of proteins, specifically highlighting the \nrole of flexibility regions and temperature-dependent conformational \nchanges that impact both stability and functionality. We anticipate that \nanalyzing conformational enzyme ensembles with energy function will \nfurther improve the accuracy of thermal stability predictions offering \npotential for in-silico pre-screening of enzyme variants.

To enable e xtracellular expression of PETase and its mutants 420 \nin Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide —421 \nSPpstu (21 amino acids) from maltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-1925 was 422 \nused to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 amino acids) of wild-type PETase. The 423 \nwild-type PETase and its mutants’ genes with SPpstu presented at the N -terminus were amplified by 424 \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 425 \nAssembly method, DNA fragments encoding wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase 426 \nwere respectively subcloned into a modified pBTK552 vector26 where the antibiotic resistance marker 427 \nwas swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a C -terminal hexa-histidine tag-428 \ncoding sequence was added. To enable intracellular expression of LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli 429 \n(DE3) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) , the nucleotide sequence encoding the original signal 430 \npeptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide 431 \nsequence were amplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 432 \nAssembly method, the DNA fragments encoding LCC and ICCM were respectively subcloned into a 433 \ncommercial vector-pET-21b (Novagen, San Diego, CA), which carry a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-434 \ncoding sequence. The electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10β was transformed with the Gibson Assembly 435 \nproduct by following a standard electroporation protocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was 436 \nextracted from the overnight culture of the cloning host by using the  QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit 437 \n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Machine Learning Main Procedure and Training the Machine Learning Models:\nEnzyme data from the Brenda Database was used to train the machine learning models to predict \nthe enzyme’s Topt. After obtaining the data, the algorithm split the data set into a training (90% of the \ndata set) and independent test set (10% of the data set). The inputs for the model were the enzyme \nfeatures calculated from the amino acid sequence and are listed in Table 1. These inputs include amino \nacid frequency, dipeptide frequency, and optimal growth temperature (OGT). Optimal growth \ntemperature is defined as the temperature at which the host organism of the enzyme has maximum growth\nand reproduction. OGT was listed in the BRENDA database. The remaining features were calculated \nfrom the amino acid sequences through the modLAMP python library(12). Before performing a cleanup \nof the BRENDA data set, there were 2745 enzyme amino acid sequences comprising the dataset. During \nthe cleanup process, we used the Pandas library to drop duplicate rows, amino acid sequences with a \nlength less than or equal to 7, and enzymes with a Topt equal to or lower than 0 degrees Celsius. The final\ntraining data consisted of 2643 enzyme amino acid sequences listed with the experimental Topts of each \nenzyme.\nThree Machine learning models were trained to predict Topt: Random Forest, Linear Regression \nand Logistic regression. Classification Models such as logistic regression are concerned with predicting a \ndiscrete label, such as Topt >=  65 degrees C. Regression models such as Linear Regression and Random \nForest models fundamentally predict a continuous quantity such as the actual Topt value for the enzymes. \nThe three Machine Learning models were implemented using the scikit python library (11).  \nIn the training stage, first Linear Regression was trained to have a high R^2 value (correlation \nvalue) between the Predicted Topt and the actual Topt of the enzymes. However in ordinary least squares \nregression,  the R^2 values were only 0.607 for the training set and 0.33 for the test set. This showed that \nLinear regression was overfitting and not generalizing well to unseen data from the test set. Thus, we had \nto regularize Linear regression by using the lasso method.

This regularization adds a penalty to a model if the model is overfitting, meaning \nif it is setting the value of its weights too high. Here,Lasso regularization set the weights of the enzyme \nfeatures that were unimportant to Linear Regression to 0. Now after implementing Lasso, Linear \nregression obtained an R^2 value of 0.54 on the training set and 0.52 on the test set. \nThen a Random Forest regression model was trained which performed much better on \nminimizing error between the predicted and actual Topt. Random Forest models operate by assembling \ndifferent decision trees, then taking the mean of those decision trees and setting that as the predicted \noutput.  Random Forest attained a R^2 value of 0.9322 on the training set and 0.624 on the test set.  \nLogistic Regression was the classifier that was trained and it was measured by its accuracy in \npredicting whether an enzyme’s Topt was above 65 degrees Celsius. Logistic Regression attained an \naccuracy of 92.6% on the training set and 88.3% on the test set. The graphs of these results are shown in \nFigure 6.\nB. Directed Evolution Procedure:\nThe ML-guided directed evolution algorithm generated a thousand mutants of PETase on every \niteration and screened them using Random Forest Regression. The enzyme with the highest Topt was then\nselected and mutated in the next iteration of the algorithm. This process is known as machine learning \n(ML) guided in silico directed evolution and it was used in order to steer the mutants of PETase towards \nhigher thermostability. In this type of directed evolution, machine learning is used to score and evaluate \ndifferent possible mutations of enzymes. Based on the machine learning scores, the algorithm then selects\nthe best mutant and uses it as a starting point again.\nFirst, in our ML-guided directed evolution approach, the algorithm randomly mutated the PETase\nenzyme at random positions, excluding the substrate site at positions where the PET molecule binds to the\nenzyme according to the Uniprot database (13). The algorithm did not mutate the binding site of the \nenzyme because this might decrease enzymatic activity. A thousand mutants were generated in this way. \nSecond, based on those mutations, the algorithm used Random Forest to score the corresponding mutants \nbased on their predicted Topt values. The best scoring mutant was then selected based on its optimal \ntemperature. The algorithm then repeated this mutation and selection process with the top mutant from \nthe previous iteration now acting as the main enzyme. Summed up, after performing directed evolution on\nthe mutants of PETase, the algorithm selected the best scoring mutant and performed random mutations \non it at random positions, excluding the substrate site. This process was repeated for 1000 iterations and \nyielded an enzyme with 71.38 degrees C Topt. However, 1000 iterations would lead to approximately \n1000 mutations in the original enzyme, which would create an enzyme vastly different from the original \nPETase. The original PETase enzyme has only 290 amino acids. Thus, this process was then also repeated\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

After 29 iterations, ML-guided directed evolution produced an enzyme with a predicted Topt of \n61.3 degrees C.  \nC. External Validation of Mutant PETase Enzyme\nThe enzyme’s melting temperature ranges and TM index values were generated by the online melting \ntemperature predictor by Ku et al (8). The TM values are shown in Table 4. These melting temperatures \nfurther validate that the mutant enzymes produced by the algorithm are stable and can function at their \noptimal temperatures without breaking down. These values show that the PETase and the mutant PETase \nenzymes’ thermostability is between 55 and 65 degrees Celsius. The TM index for the mutated PETase \nenzyme is larger than that of the original PETase enzyme, signifying that increasing the enzyme’s Topt \nalso increased the enzyme’s thermostability."}

Thus, we evaluated the \npotential activity of a mesophilic depolymerase at desired temperatures  with an aim of \nimproving the thermal stability of IsPETase without compromising its activity. To this end, we \nintroduced N233C and S282C mutations to create an additional disulfide bond  (SS1) in the \nquadruple-point IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N246D variant (Is-4p) that we previously reported ,22 \nresulting in the generation of the IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N233C/N246D/S288C variant ( Is-4pC) \n(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).22,24 Surprisingly, the derivative melting temperature (TmD) of \nIs-4pC was found to be 72°C, which was 10 °C and 23°C higher than that of Is-4p and wild-\ntype IsPETase, respectively (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, Is-4pC exhibited \n1.5 and 5-fold higher PET depolymerization activity than those of Is-4p and wild-type IsPETase, \nrespectively, at 40°C (Fig. 1b). However, the expression of Is-4pC dramatically reduced the \namount of soluble protein compared with wild-type, and most of the expressed protein formed \ninsoluble aggregates (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). This limited further evaluation of \nPET depolymerization capacity and analysis of potential applications of th e variant. The \nproduction of large amounts of soluble PET hydrolase is an important parameter in industrial-\nlevel PET biodegradation in addition to its thermal stability and activity.

Interestingly, all variants exhibited up to 25-fold increase in soluble \nprotein yield compared with Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) . However, most \nvariants showed  a dramatically decrease in TmD values and PET hydrolysis activities \n(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). One exception was the P181V variant, which exhibited \ncomparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity to Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3) . \nIntroduction of the P181V mutation into Is-4pC resulted in a 40-fold increase in soluble protein \nyield compared with Is-4pC, with comparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 1b, \nc, Supplementary Figs. 1–3). We further observed no significant difference between Is -\n4pC+P181V and Is -4pC in Tm D values and the total amount of expressed protein, which \nindicate that the enhanced yield of  the soluble Is-4pC+P181V protein is not due to increased \nintracellular protein stability or enhanced transcriptional and translational processes, but rather \ndue to post-translational folding. Specifically, mutation of the trans-proline 181 unchains the \ndihedral angles of this residue, especially at the ψ angle, triggering a large change in the φ angle \nof the pre -proline A180 (Fig. 1 d). We speculated that this structural change occur s in most \nP181-point variants and strengthens the β-strand network, thereby increasing the efficiency of \nfolding of the Is-4pC+P181V variant (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4). \nThe region containing A180 and P181 is located at the intersection of two imaginary \nhemispheres of the protein hydrophobic core. The above results indicate the importance of this \nregion in folding of the protein (Fig. 1f). We replaced A180 of Is-4pC+P181V with other small \nresidues, such as G, S, T, and V , to investigate how further modification of the region affects \nprotein solubility. Interestingly, all four variants showed an increase in soluble protein yield \n(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, Is-4pC+A180V+P181V (an Is-8p variant) \nshowed an approximately 65% increase in soluble protein yield compared with Is-4pC+P181V , \nwhich corresponds to a 65-fold increase compared with Is-4pC (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Moreover, the thermal stability and PET hydrolysis activity of Is-8p were \ncomparable to those of Is-4pC (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). This implies that the \nfolding process of IsPETase is influenced by multiple structural factors as well as β-sheet repair \nat the protein core. \n \nEngineering with non-negative and complementary accumulation \nThe improved soluble protein yield of Is -8p led us to apply various enzym e \nengineering approaches. We modified the local surface charge of Is-8p by mutating R132 and \nR224 to E and substituting N37 with D in an attempt to optimize the adsorption process of the \nprotein to the PET substrate. Although the TmD values of the R132E and R224E mutants were \nslightly lower than that of Is -8p, all three variants showed up to 50% enhance ment in PET \nhydrolysis activity at 50°C compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further \nenhance the thermal stability of Is -8p, we introduced six new disulfide bonds by creating the \nfollowing double mutants: A171C+S193C (SS2), A202C+V211C (SS3), N73C+A102C (SS4), \nA80C+V149C (SS5), T195C+R224C (SS6), and N275C+F284C (SS7). Among these, SS4, SS5, \nand SS6 had decreased TmD values compared with Is -8p, implying that disulfide bonds were \nnot formed in these mutants (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, SS2, SS3, and SS7 \nincreased TmD values by approximately 4°C, suggesting that these disulfide bonds were indeed \npresent in Is -8p (Fig. 2a , Supplementary Fig. 1). The PET hydrolysis activity of  the SS 2 \nmutation increased by 20%, whereas that of SS3 and SS 7 mutations slightly decreased \ncompared with Is-8p at 50°C (Fig. 2a). The wobbling W185 residue is known to be crucial for \nboth enzyme activity and protein stability. 26 Because S214 is located in the vicinity of this \nresidue, we replaced S214 with 19 other residues to identify the optimal residue in terms of \nenzyme activity and protein stability . Although PET hydrolysis activity decreased compared \nwith that of Is -8p in all cases, thermal stability  was improved in several of the new variants  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In particular, the TmD value of S214Y was 6.5 °C higher than \nthat of Is-8p (Fig. 2a). \nModification of Is -8p enabled us to  identify seven mutation points that improved \nthermal stability, enhanced PET hydrolysis activity, or had other complementary effects. Next, \nwe combined multiple mutations to design a total of nine combinatorial variants of Is -8p, \nincluding six balance -directed variants (Is -8pCom1–Is-8pCom6) and three stability -directed \nvariants (Is-8pCom7–Is-8pCom9) (Table 1). All six balance-directed variants exhibited enhanced \nactivities against both p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB) and PET, along with either increased \n(Is-8pCom1, Is-8pCom5, and Is-8pCom6) or decreased ( Is-8pCom2, Is-8pCom3, and Is-8pCom4) TmD \nvalues compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b–d and Supplementary Fig. 1). All three stability-directed \nvariants increased TmD values compared with Is-8p but decreased enzyme activity (Fig. 2b–d \nand Supplementary  Fig. 1). These results i ndicate that the combinatorial variants were \ngenerated in the intended directions, and we selected the Is-8pCom6 (Z1-PETase) and Is-8pCom9 \n(Z2-PETase) variants as the final balance- and stability-directed variants, respectively (Fig. 2b–\nd). Z2-PETase with a TmD value of 86°C has much higher thermostability than Z1-PETase with \na TmD value of 74°C; conversely, Z1-PETase showed a 50% increase in PET hydrolysis activity \nwhile Z2-PETase showed somewhat decreased activity, compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b, d). \n \nStructural interpretation of the engineered mutants \n The crystal structure of Z2 -PETase provides a structural explanation of the effects of \nthe introduced mutations in this study  (Supplementary Table. 3). We identified two disulfide \nbonds of IsPETase wild-type, i.e., SS1Ori and SS2Ori, in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3). The four mutated \nresidues in Is-4p, namely, S121E, D186H, S242T, and N246D , were found to be located at \nidentical positions as those in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Table. 1). All Is-8pCom variants having the \nA180V and P181V mutations in Z2-PETase showed a significant increase in soluble protein \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Three \nmutations, i.e., N37D, R132E, and R224E, resulted in a large change in the protein surface \ncharge to negative, and in fact, the pI values of wild-type and Z2-PETase were 9.44 and 7.54, \nrespectively. The charge change occurs far from the active site, likely facilitating the adsorption \nof the enzyme to the PET substrate and thereby increasing PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and \nSupplementary Fig. 7). The four new disulfide bonds (SS1, SS2, SS3, and SS7) that were formed \nafter the introduction of mutations stabilized the periphery of each disulfide-formed region in \nZ2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Supplementary  Figs. 8 and 9). Although the length of SS3 was 2.3 Å, \nwhich was slightly longer than the optimal length of a disulfide bond, the other three disulfide \nbonds were within the optimal disulfide bond length range (Supplementary Fig. 8). The S214Y \nmutation stabilized the region surrounding the wobbling W185; however, the S214Y mutation \nappears to interfere with the dynamics of W185, resulting in a dramatic decrease in PET \nhydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9).  \n \nEvaluation of variants in a product-deficient system \nWe compared Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase to identify the most superb IsPETase variant. \nThe stability -directed variant Z2-PETase was much more thermostable  than the balance -\ndirected variant Z1-PETase; TmD between the two variants was found to be 1 2°C (Fig. 2b)."}

This system was applied \nto PET hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 10), which showed that the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Z1-PETase was higher than that of Z2-PETase across the entire temperature range \nfrom 30°C to 60°C, although the optimal temperatures of these two variants were different (Fig. \n4c–f). These results suggest that maintaining or enhancing the high activity of mesophilic PET \nhydrolase is critical for the development of a high-performance PET hydrolase with enhanced \nthermostability, and consequentially, we selected Z1-PETase as the IsPETase variant with the \nhighest PET depolymerizing activity among the tested combinatorial variants.  \nWe then compared the PET depolymerizing activity of Z1-PETase with those of other \nengineered PET hydrolases such as LC-CICCG, Dura-PETase, and Fast-PETase, and surprisingly, \nZ1-PETase kinetically outperforms LC-CICCG and Dura-PETase at all temperatures tested and \nexhibits high depolymerization rates (76.9%–90.1%) (Fig. 4c–f). Fast -PETase exhibited a \nslightly faster lag phase than  Z1-PETase at 30 °C and 40 °C; however, activity decreased \ndramatically at 50°C and 60°C, which was consistent with the much lower thermostability of \nFast-PETase (64°C)20 than Z1-PETase (Fig. 4c -f). Interestingly, the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Dura-PETase was much lower than that of Z1-PETase at all temperature ranges (Fig. \n4c-f), although the thermostability of these IsPETase variants was similar. These results further \nemphasize the importance of maintaining or enhancing mesophilic PET hydrol ysis activity \nduring the development of high-performance PET hydrolases.  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The lag phase of film decomposition was much longer \nthan that of powder decomposition at the same temperature (Fig. 4 d, e, g), suggesting that the \navailability of the PET surface for enzyme adsorption determines the initial depolymerization \nrate. \n \nDepolymerization of post-consumer PET powder using a pH-stat bioreactor  \nWe evaluated the industrial application of Z1-PETase by studying  PET plastic \ndepolymerization using a pH-stat bioreactor. We used transparent post-consumer PET powder \noriginated from transparent PET flakes collected in Daegu, Korea as the substrate (Fig. 5a and \nSupplementary Fig. 11). When the bioreactor was operated at 40°C under the pH-8.0 stationary \ncondition with 2.5% (w/v) of the substrate, 50% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 8 h, \nand 92.5% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 24 h  (Fig. 5b) . At 55°C, the initial \ndepolymerization rate was much higher than that at 40°C, demonstrating the thermal effect on \nPET degradation. At 55°C, 50% and 93% of the PET powder were depolymerized in 2 h and 8 \nh, respectively  (Fig. 5b).  This corresponds to a specific productivity value of 5.2 \ngmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1, with a maximum rate of 17.2 gmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1 observed \nin the early phase of the reaction. Due to the high activity and stability of Z1-PETase, the final \ndepolymerization rates of PET powder at 40°C and 55°C were not significantly different from \neach other (Fig. 5b).  \nIt should be noted  that colored PET plastics, such as brown plastic  beer bottles, are \ndifficult to recycle because they contain impurities, such as pigments, nylon and iron.

At both temperatures, the final \ndepolymerization rate of colored PET was 90.2%, which was  slightly lower than th at of \ntransparent PET, possibly due to impurities contained in colored PET (Fig. 5d).  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

With an estimated production of at least 1 million PET bottles 65 \nevery minute (2) and a global recycling rate of 9% (3) , the rapid and large accumulation of 66 \nnon-biodegradable post-consumer PET waste either end up in land fills, terrestrial or aquatic 67 \nenvironment. These PET that end up in the terrestrial or aquati c environment not only have a 68 \nslow rate of decomposition, but can also subsequently enter the  marine ecosystem as 69 \nmicroplastics - posing risks to the environment and the health of both animals and humans (4, 70 \n5). Consequently, addressing the PET waste crisis is imperative  for both environmental and 71 \nhealth sustainability. Traditional solid waste treatment method s, such as landfill and 72 \nincineration, have limitations in terms of secondary pollution and limited land resources. The 73 \nmain thermomechanical and chemical recycling methods are energy -intensive, requiring high 74 \ntemperatures, and can result in alterations to the properties o f the PET plastic (6). Thus, there 75 \nis a growing interest in less energy-intensive or \"natural\" met hods for processing this 76 \nmaterial.  77 \n 78 \nThe discovery of the first PET degrading enzyme PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 79 \n(IsPETase) (7, 8) in 2016, gave hopes to a biological solution through enzymes and microbial 80 \nfactories for processing this inert plastic. Enzyme-catalyzed P ET recycling or bioprocessing 81 \ncan proceed under mild reaction conditions, with minimal energy  and chemical usage. This 82 \nmethod of recycling is thus a more environmentally responsible alternative to petroleum-83 \nderived production processes. To  i m p r o v e  P E T a s e  t o w a r d s  p r a c t i cal application, there has 84 \nbeen numerous studies reporting more thermostable and active ve rsions of the enzyme (9). 85 \nSince then, various PET degradation enzymes have also been identified, including CALB 86 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

One of these plastics is PET which is mainly used 9 \nfor bottles and textiles. In this research, we investigate the PET degrading ability of the IsPETase 10 \nhomolog ScLipA from Streptomyces coelicolor. Of 96 different Streptomyces strains screened, 18 % 11 \nwere able to degrade the model substrate BHET. Three different variants of lipase A, named ScLipA, 12 \nS2LipA and S92LipA were identified and analyzed in detail. The lipA gene was deleted from S. 13 \ncoelicolor M145 using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in reduced BHET degradation. LipA overexpression in 14 \nthe knock-out background significantly enhanced BHET degradation. All three enzymes were 15 \nexpressed in E. coli BL21 for protein purification and biochemical analysis, showing that enzymatic 16 \nactivity most likely resides in a dimeric form of the enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature were 17 \ndetermined to be pH 7 and 25 °C for all three variants. Using these conditions, the activity on BHET 18 \nand amorphous PET film was investigated.

They are relatively easy and cheap to produce, extremely versatile and durable 27 \nmaterials, which makes them remarkably attractive for a wide range of applications [1], [2]. This has 28 \ncaused the demand and production of plastics to rise steadily to an estimated 9.2 billion metric tons 29 \n(Mt) produced as of 2023 [1], [3], [4]. Of all plastic produced, 75 % (6.9 billion Mt) has been 30 \nmismanaged or landfilled [4]. Durability and resistance to degradation of these polymers, combined 31 \nwith the increasing output of waste generated by humans, makes plastic accumulation and pollution a 32 \nmajor global environmental concern [5]. In fact, commonly used plastics are generally not 33 \nbiodegradable, accumulate in landfills or leak into terrestrial and/or aquatic environments, where they 34 \ndisintegrate into micro- and nano-plastics, thereby posing a serious threat to many ecosystems [5].  35 \nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) is extensively used to produce bottles, food packaging, clothing and 36 \nfilms. The high demand for PET makes it one of the most common plastics that we encounter in 37 \neveryday life with 18.8 million tons being produced worldwide in 2015 alone [6]. PET waste 38 \nmanagement in most countries today consists mainly of incineration and landfilling. Both practices are 39 \ncausing detrimental effects to the environment, such as leaching and the release of toxic compounds 40 \n[7]. On the other hand, an increasing number of countries have recycling systems in place to prevent 41 \nenvironmental accumulation and make renewed use of the PET waste produced. Despite such efforts, 42 \nthe recovery ratio is far less than 50 % and only a minor fraction is used to manufacture new products, 43 \nwith substantial amounts of PET still entering the environment [8].  44 \nWith plastic waste accumulating in the environment, investigating the adaptation and response of soil 45 \nand aquatic microorganisms to plastic exposure has proven eminent. Microbial response and 46 \nadaptation mechanisms are likely to help battle plastic pollution and initiate remediation and recycling 47 \noptions. Enzymatic degradation already has proven to enable natural routes to depolymerize these 48 \nrecalcitrant polymeric materials. Several PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) have been identified, 49 \ninitiating biodegradation of this polymer. Predominantly, these are esterases, lipases, cutinases and 50 \ncutinase-like enzymes exhibiting hydrolysis of the ester bond between terephthalic acid (TPA) and 51 \nethylene glycol (EG) moieties within the PET polymer [9]–[14]. It was not until 2016 that Yoshida and 52 \ncolleagues reported the discovery of a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (hereafter I. 53 \nsakaiensis), which had evolved towards the degradation and utilization of PET as a sole carbon 54 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The enzyme identified as responsible for the first step in the catabolism of PET is the 55 \nIsPETase (ISF6_4831), classified as an extracellular esterase. This enzyme hydrolyses PET into its 56 \nmonomer mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with only trace amounts of bis(2-57 \nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) being observed. To complete the 58 \nbreakdown of PET, I. sakaiensis possesses another enzyme, the Is MHETase (ISF6_0224), which is 59 \ncapable of hydrolyzing MHET into TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), common starting chemicals to 60 \npolymerize PET [15]. Compared to other PHEs which have a broader range of substrates, the 61 \nIsPETase displays significantly higher activity against BHET, PET films, and commercial bottle-derived 62 \nPET at 40 °C [15]. Currently, all PETase-like enzymes are described in the PAZY-database [16]. 63 \nMany genera of soil and aquatic bacteria are exposed to accumulated plastics. An important phylum of 64 \nbacteria remaining to be investigated is the Actinobacteria. This phylum consists of various complex 65 \ngenera such as Thermobifida, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and many more. Several enzymes of 66 \nactinobacterial origin such as the LCC, TfCut2 and many more have previously been identified and 67 \ncharacterized to exhibit PET degradi ng abilities ear ning their place in the PAZY database [9]–[11], 68 \n[13], [16]–[19]. However, for various other genera including Streptomyces only limited information is 69 \navailable [20]–[25]. Only one Streptomyces enzyme, SM14est has been described [21].  70 \nStreptomycetes are filamentous growing soil-dwelling bacteria with a characteristic lifecycle. They are 71 \nrenowned for their capability to produce antibiotics but are also known to excrete enzymes to degrade 72 \ncomplex natural polymers, including plant biomass [26]–[28]. Depending on the soil pollution rate and 73 \nthe distance to the polluted area, it is possible to recover 7,5 x 10 4 to 3,0 x 10 4 plastic microparticles 74 \nper kilogram (kg) of soil [29]. This equates to 2-20 milligrams (mg) of recoverable plastic particles per 75 \nkg of soil [29]. Hence, the rhizosphere and its associated microbes, such as Streptomyces are 76 \nextensively exposed to plastics. This exposure to plastics and their ability to degrade complex biomass 77 \nwith hydrolytic enzymes makes them a promising genus to explore for novel PHEs [20]–[25], [30], [31]. 78 \nThese possible PHEs are expected to be secreted enzymes. Expression of enzymes in Streptomyces 79 \nis a highly regulated process and hence, such regulation will likely play an important role in putative 80 \nPET degrading activity [32].  81 \nIn this research, we identified Lipase A from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScLipA) as a  homolog to the 82 \nIsPETase. Consequently, we investigated the ability of S. coelicolor to degrade the PET model 83 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Conservation of this BHET degrading ability was investigated by screening a 84 \ncollection of 96 previously isolated Actinobacteria (predominantly Streptomyces) under various 85 \nconditions [33]. This yielded insight into the optimal conditions needed to induce BHET degradation as 86 \nwell as in the abundance of strains exhibiting BHET-degrading capability. In one or more of the 87 \nprovided conditions, 44 % of the strains could degrade BHET, 18 % of the evaluated strains were able 88 \nto degrade BHET individually confirming a wider distribution of this ability in nature. The presence of 89 \nLipA in these strains was explored and the corresponding genes were sequenced. The enzyme is 90 \nhighly conserved and can be classified into three different variants. The S. coelicolor variant further 91 \nnamed ScLipA, the MBT92 variant (S92LipA) which is only present in MBT92, and a conserved variant 92 \npresent in all other active strains ( S2LipA). The functionality of all three LipA variants in the 93 \ndegradation ability of BHET and amorphous PET in Streptomyces species was investigated. A knock-94 \nout of the lipA gene was constructed in S. coelicolor M145, and overexpression constructs of the three 95 \nvariants were expressed in the knock-out to study the effect of the genes in vivo.  The individual 96 \nenzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli  and purified for the analysis of substrate specificity, 97 \nthermostability, and other properties.

The catalytic 114 \ntriad was conserved, as well as two of the three residues of the previously described substrate binding 115 \nsite (Fig. 1E and F) [36]. The difference in the binding site is a phenylalanine in LipA instead of a 116 \ntyrosine in Is PETase, as shown in figure 1E.

Due to its limited solubility, 134 \nthe addition of BHET causes the plates to become turbid. When BHET is converted to MHET and/or 135 \nTPA, a halo of clearance appears. The secreted enzyme activity was expected to be tightly regulated 136 \nin response to environmental growth conditions [32]. Therefore, we tested N-acetyl glucosamine 137 \n(GlcNAc) as a possible inducer of secreted enzyme activity. GlcNAc is a monomer of chitin and 138 \npeptidoglycan, which under poor nutritional conditions induces development and antibiotic production 139 \nin Streptomyces coelicolor [39], [40], whereas in nutrient-rich environments these responses are 140 \nblocked [35]. We anticipated that GlcNAc may act as an inducer for the production of extracellular 141 \nenzymes such as lipases, esterases and possibly BHET-degrading enzymes. Hence, S. coelicolor 142 \nM145 was grown in the presence and absence of BHET [10 mM], mannitol [25 mM] and N-acetyl 143 \nglucosamine [25 mM] in all possible combinations.  144 \nInterestingly, a clearance halo was observed at 18 days of growth as shown in figure 2A. Notably, 145 \nfigure 2A displays that the addition of GlcNAc as inducer seemed to induce the degradation of BHET. 146 \nAdditionally, S. coelicolor produces agarase, which resulted in ‘sinking’ halos which you can see in the 147 \ncontrols without BHET (Fig. 2A, StrepMM) [41]. These ‘sinking halos’ looked very similar to clearance 148 \nhalos. Therefore, the ability S. coelicolor to degrade BHET in liquid culture was investigated using 149 \nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  For the liquid analysis, strain M145 was 150 \nprecultured and inoculated in minimal liquid medium without polyethylene glycol (NMM) with and 151 \nwithout BHET and GlcNAc. Samples were taken after 24 h and 72 h and analyzed using LC-MS. In the 152 \nnegative ionization mode, the mass of TPA (166 g/mol) could be observed around 4 min retention time 153 \nshowing a small peak on the UV spectrum, MHET (210 g/mol) appeared around 5.2 min with a strong 154 \nsignal on both the MS as well as the UV. Finally, BHET (255 g/mol) could be observed in the positive 155 \nionization mode between 5.5 and 6 min with a strong signal at 240 nm (Fig. 2B and 2C). Around 9.5 156 \nmin, impurity was observed, which was present in the BHET stock (Fig. 2C). When grown in NMM 157 \nmedium containing BHET, 30-50 % of the BHET was degraded within 24 h, after 72 h, all BHET was 158 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Indeed, the addition of GlcNAc enhanced the degradation of 159 \nBHET (Fig. 2D).  160 \n 161 \nFigure 2: The ability of S. coelicolor M145 to degrade BHET .   162 \nA) Degradation of BHET by S. coelicolor after 18 days of growth on Strep MM Difco agar with and 163 \nwithout Mannitol, BHET and GlcNAc B) LC-MS trace of BHET in positive ionization, MHET and TPA in 164 \nthe negative ionization.

Growth of these strains appeared to be 176 \ndelayed with 10 mM BHET, and impaired with 20 mM BHET and higher concentrations. Hence, a 177 \nconcentration of 10 mM of BHET was chosen for screening, with all tested strains able to grow and 178 \nhalos readily observed (Fig. 3A).  179 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Seven strains did not grow on the plates and were 182 \ntaken out of the screen. Spore suspensions were stamped onto plates containing StrepMM with 183 \ndifferent agar brands containing combinations of BHET [10 mM], Mannitol [25 mM] and GlcNAc [25 184 \nmM]. The type of agar used clearly impacted the observed degradation patterns. The agar brand 185 \nseems to have a clear influence on the degradation pattern (Supplement 1). Difco agar was chosen as 186 \nthe agar source for all further experiments since most strains showed growth on Difco agar. The 187 \naddition of GlcNAc resulted in a different halo pattern and more predominant halos during the bulk 188 \nscreen and induced BHET degradation in most strains (Fig 3B, Supplement 1).  189 \nActinobacteria, especially Streptomyces, depend on environmental cues and interspecies interactions 190 \nfor the induction of enzymes and secondary metabolites [43]. Consequently, it was important to 191 \ninvestigate their individual BHET degrading activity on separate plates. All strains showing halos in the 192 \nbulk BHET screen were grown on individual plates (Supplement 2). Of 38 active strains, only 17 193 \nstrains exhibited individual activity on BHET after 10 days of growth (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, most 194 \nstrains required the addition of GlcNAc to express the BHET degrading enzyme. Only 5 strains, MBT5, 195 \n12, 15, 91 and 92 degraded BHET in the absence of GlcNAc. MBT92 appeared to exhibit constitutive 196 \nexpression showing a similar-sized halo in all conditions. To substantiate a good correlation between 197 \nhalo size and biochemical degradation, strains MBT2, 5, 12, 28, 92 and S. coelicolor M145 were 198 \nincubated with approximately 2*10 6 spores on StrepMM Difco plates containing BHET and GlcNAc. 199 \nSamples of agar were taken after 15 days using an agar excision tool to cut out part of the halo. Since 200 \nS. coelicolor M145 displayed no activity after 15 days (see also above), halos were excised after 18 201 \ndays. Samples were spun down using nylon spin columns, separating all liquids from the agar, and 202 \nprepped for LC-MS analysis (Fig. 3D). In all strains, clear conversion from BHET to MHET was 203 \nobserved. MBT2, 5, 12, and 28 show traces of TPA suggesting further conversion of MHET.  204 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This resulted in strain S3 expressing SclipA, 259 \nS5 expressing S2lipA and S7 expressing S92lipA. Two expression media were chosen namely NMM 260 \nas minimal medium with a defined carbon source and rich medium tryptic soy broth sucrose (TSBS) 261 \nwhich is a protein expression medium. Expression was validated on both media using SDS page and 262 \nWestern blot (Fig. 6A-B and 6D-E). Both NMM with 5 % (w/v) glucose and TSBS show clear signal on 263 \nwestern blot indicating that the enzyme is expressed.  264 \nBHET degradation was examined in vivo by inoculating 1,0*108 spores in 50 ml of NMM with glucose 265 \n[5 % (v/v)] and BHET or TSBS containing BHET. Samples were taken at 24, 48 and 72 h and analyzed 266 \nusing LC-MS. The percentages BHET, MHET and TPA were calculated over the total peak area. After 267 \n24 h, while the spores are still germinating, limited activity is observed. After 48 h, on NMM, the knock-268 \nout shows significantly less activity on BHET than the wildtype strain. After 72 h, there is a clear 269 \ndifference in the degradation pattern of the knock-out compared to the wildtype strain. The 270 \noverexpression constructs show 40-50 % degradation, which is similar to the wildtype strain, although 271 \nit is significantly higher than in the knock-out strain (parental strain) (Fig. 6C). Some residual activity, 272 \nnot related to LipA, was still observed in the knock-out strain.    273 \nAfter 48 h on TSBS, there was no difference observed in the BHET degrading ability of the wildtype 274 \nstrain compared to the knock-out strain; After 72 h, the wildtype strain degraded significantly more 275 \nBHET than the knock-out strain. Unlike minimal medium, the strains containing the overexpressed lipA 276 \nvariants showed drastic BHET degradation on TSBS after 48 h, with some variation between the 277 \ndifferent enzyme variants (Fig. 6F). After 72 h, the knock-out converted approximately 23 % of the 278 \nBHET to MHET, whereas the wild-type strain converted approximately 32 %, the overexpression 279 \nstrains degraded all BHET after 72 h and TPA could be observed in the medium. The knock-out still 280 \nshowed some activity suggesting the presence of at least one other enzyme with BHET degrading 281 \nactivity.

The three variants ScLipA (present in S. coelicolor), S92LipA (present in MBT92 395 \nand S2LipA (present all other active strains) were further investigated. The in vivo activity of Sc LipA 396 \nwas investigated by comparing a knock-out strain with the wildtype strain, in both rich and minimal 397 \nmedium; the knock-out exhibited a significant decrease in its BHET degrading activity. Since some 398 \nremaining BHET degradation was still observed in the knock-out strain, at least one other enzyme is 399 \nlikely to be involved in BHET degradation. However, this activity most likely resides with another type 400 \nof enzyme since no other IsPETase homolog was found during the homology search. All three LipA 401 \nvariants, when expressed in the knock-out background under a semi-constitutive promoter, exhibited 402 \nsignificantly enhanced degradation of BHET compared to the wildtype, on both rich and minimal 403 \nmedium. The variant enzymes were expressed in E. coli , purified and subjected to enzyme assays. 404 \nInterestingly, after purification, two clear bands are visible at ~30 kDa and ~60 kDa. Native enzyme 405 \nanalysis via a zymogram indicated that activity only resided with the higher band, suggesting that the 406 \nactive form was a dimer. Indeed, 3D-structure prediction with AlphaFold-multimer suggested the 407 \nformation of a dimeric enzyme with a probability of 90 % (S11) [47].  408 \nAll enzyme variants were found to have an optimal pH of 7 and optimal temperature of 25 °C. 409 \nColorimetric BHET assays confirmed BHET degrading activity of S2LipA and Sc LipA under optimal 410 \nconditions. Additionally, incubation of amorphous PET film with purified S2LipA caused the formation 411 \nof indents and roughening of the surface, similar to the activity of PET-degrading cutinase TfCut2, 412 \nfurther confirming PETase-like activity.  413 \nOur data suggests that PET is not the main substrate for these enzymes and that PET degradation 414 \nmerely appears as a moonlighting effect of the lipase activity, similar to the moonlighting effect 415 \ndescribed for TfCut2. S92LipA and ScLipA showed less activity than S2LipA which most probably is 416 \ndue to structural variations in the enzymes caused by the various amino acid substitutions. For 417 \nexample, S2LipA contains a region rich in serines close to important substrate binding residues and 418 \nthe substrate binding cleft (Fig. 4I) as opposed to S92LipA and ScLipA.

In addition, the initial enzyme–PET interactions of considerable\nstrength with energies below−10 kcal·mol-1 were established early in the simulations (PES-\nH1: 2.0–40.2ns; LCC:0.8–15.0ns)andabundantcontacts(definedbasedontheresidue–PET\ndistance requirement≤3Å) were observed at the surfaces of LCC and PES-H1, suggesting\nthat initial binding is based on general features such as charge and polarity rather than\nspecific recognition sites.56–58 These initial contacts occurred almost everywhere on the sur-\nface of both enzymes and can be divided into proximal and distal binding, depending on\nwhether PET was located within 12Å of the catalytic serine or not. These contact areas\nare colored blue and red in Fig.2A, respectively, and the regions where distal and proxi-\nmal areas overlap are indicated in purple. To follow the progression of the contacts during\nthe simulations, we compared the contact areas during the first 50ns and the remaining\nsimulation time.

The general findings for both, simulations lasting for 1.5µs and the\nelongated simulations lasting for 2µs, are that when the initial contacts were established in\nproximal regions, the PET contact area remained close to the active site (PES-H1: 2 of 6;\nLCC: 4 of 6 simulations).

To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the physicochemical\nnature of the initial enzyme–PET contacts and then made rationally motivated mutations,\nwhich are studiedin silicoand in vitro.\nNegative surface charges impede PET adsorption LCC has a net charge of +5,\nwhile PES-H1 has a net charge of −5, which is reflected in their electrostatic potential\nsurface (EPS, shown in Fig.2B). The EPS of LCC is mostly neutral and positive (shown in\nwhite and blue, respectively), while PES-H1 features large surface patches that are strongly\nnegative (shown in red). For PES-H1 in particular, the negative regions overlap with those\nthat do not have pronounced PET contacts. In addition, we visualized the EPS of the PET\nbulk used to construct the initial enzyme–PET systems. A mostly hydrophobic surface is\nrevealed, with predominantly convex and exposed areas being partially negatively charged,\nwhile stronger positive or negative potentials can be found in concave and buried regions\n(Fig.S2). We therefore assume that negative charges at the surface discourage PET binding,\nwhich could open up the possibility of preventing distal binding to PET by introducing\nnegatively charged residues there. This idea is consistent with the results of Nakamura\net al., who demonstrated accelerated binding to PET surfaces with higher positive charge\ndensity at the enzyme surface of PET2.23 In addition, Sagonget al.found that changes in the\nelectrostatic potential surface of a loop close to the active site increases PET degradation\nactivity of Rhizobacter gummiphilus PETase (RgPETase), especially when increasing the\nnegative surface charge.59 In order to transfer this finding from proximal regions to distal\nones, they mutated four distal surface-exposed arginine to alanine and glutamate, which also\nincreases the PET degradation activity.\n8\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We thus conclude that positive regions enhance overall PET adsorption and lead\nto prolonged PET retention in distal regions when present there, which in turn hinders the\nprocess of PET binding in a productive conformation at the active site.\nApolar residues contribute most to PET adsorption of PES-H1To identify the\namino acids most favored by PET, we calculated the interaction energyEint between PET\nand each amino-acid type for all six simulations of both enzymes. We then scaled the result-\ning energy values by the number of residues of the corresponding amino-acid type that were\nin contact with PET during each simulation and took the average of the six values. These\nresults are shown in Fig.2C, where we grouped the amino acids according to their physico-\nchemical property. The scaling by the contact residues accounts for the fact that more polar\nthan apolar residues are exposed in both enzymes, making them more accessible to PET than\napolar residues. The overall interaction with PET (i.e., the sum of all scaledEint values) is\nstronger for LCC than for PES-H1, with polar residues contributing most to LCC binding\nand apolar contributing most to PES-H1 binding. Charged amino acids contribute the least\nto PET binding for both enzymes, followed by the aromatic ones. Given the progression\nfrom distal to proximal binding observed for PES-H1 but not for LCC in this study, we\npropose that modification of the surface of LCC to make it more similar to that of PES-H1\ncould increase proximal PET binding for LCC and thus its enzymatic activity.

The introduction of negatively charged\nresidues successfully changed the EPS in this region from positive or neutral to negative and\nsignificantly increasedEint for the corresponding LCCIG mutations (R143E, R151E) and to a\nlesser extent for the PES-H1FY mutation R19E. The latter can be explained by the fact that\nthe PES-H1FY surface was already rather negative before this mutation, which reduces the\nmutation effect. PET did not interact with position 75 in any of the simulations with PES-\nH1FY and PES-H1FY S13A/R19E/R75E. This is probably because the starting structure\nchosen for the simulations had the residue 75 farthest from PET among the three mutation\nsites. Therefore, the effect of the R75E mutation cannot be quantified. The implementation\nof apolar residues, especially alanine, at the expense of polar residues also significantly\nincreased Eint (e.g., S145A in LCCIG, S13A in PES-H1FY), while larger apolar residues such\nas valine or leucine yielded no significant changes or even made the interaction at these\nsites more favorable (e.g., T211V and N239L in LCCIG; Q26L and T28V in PES-H1FY). In\nconclusion, local PET binding was successfully reduced in our simulations by introducing\nsmall apolar alanine or negatively charged residues. This is hypothesized to promote the\nprogression of the enzyme–PET contact area towards the binding cleft, thereby enhancing\nPET binding and hydrolysis.\nDistal mutations have a major influence on PET degradation activityTo test our\nhypotheses derived from thein silico studies, two of the triple mutants were subjected to\nin vitro analysis: PES-H1FY T11V/S13A/S14A with increased hydrophobicity and LCCIG\nR143E/S145A/R151E with increased negative charge. PES-H1FY and the LCCICCG variant\nwere used as reference enzymes. The latter was used instead of LCCIG to allow for a better\ncomparison to published results.3,14 The PET degradation activity was determined with\namorphous PET films under specific reaction conditions favored for each enzyme.14 For PES-\nH1FY, 1M potassium phosphate buffer has ensured the most efficient hydrolysis rates, which\nwas presumably attributed to its stabilizing effect.14,61,62 For an optimal comparison with\n14\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Unfortunately, the LCCICCG triple mutant could not be expressed, possibly\ndue to the altered surface charge, which could introduce repulsive forces that interfere with\nnative folding.\nThe percentage weight loss of the PET films after 24h was determined to evaluate the\nenzymatic PET degrading activity. As shown in Fig.4 the substitution of three residues in\nPES-H1FY far away from the binding site led to greatly reduced activity. This observation\ndoes not fully agree with our hypothesis that decreasing the surface polarity far away from\nthe PET binding site should encourage proximal PET binding and thus increase the PET\ndegrading activity. On the other hand, thein vitro results confirmed our hypothesis that\nthe initial binding to the PET surface plays an important role for the enzymatic activity.\nThis binding occurs far away from the active site, ruling out any direct interference with the\nhydrolysis reaction, as shown with the current PES-H1FY variant T11V/S13A/S14A (Fig.3).\nTherefore, future studies should thoroughly investigate mutations on the LCC and PES-H1\nsurface that enhance PET degradation."}

To this end, we first examined individual\nentry histories and identified effects that promote or inhibit entry by calculatingEint be-\ntween the PET-5mer and residues within 3Å during entry. PET-5mer entry can be hindered\nby strong PET–enzyme interactions prior to entry or by repulsion of PET-5mer within the\nbinding cleft, so that PET-5mer states outside the cleft are favored (Fig.S5A). Conversely,\nan entry-promoting effect has favorable interactions during entry, which facilitate structural\nPET-5mer rearrangements that overcome PET–PET interactions (Fig.S5B). Furthermore,\nPET-5mer entry gets supported through stabilizing interactions for productive PET5-mer\nposes, which compensate for the loss of PET–PET interactions (Fig.S5C).\nTo obtain a more general overview, FESs were created using a similar approach as before,\nbut this time for the PET–enzyme interactions. The SER–C distance was again used as a\ncoordinate to monitor the entry process, while Eint between the PET-5mer and selected\nresidues was used as another coordinate.

Our aim was to identify residues that\nlack entry-promoting FES features and are therefore promising mutation targets to improve\nPET entry ability. FES features to be introduced include the creation of free energy minima\nin the productive region with a SER–C distance below 4Å, indicating stabilized productive\npositions of PET-5mer, the elimination of free energy minima in the non-productive region,\nindicating reduced interactions with PET-5mer, and the facilitation of the transition from\nthe non-productive to the productive region by avoiding energy barriers there. The residues\nthat we identified as promising mutation sites were then mutated to glycine or alanine;\nlarger amino acids were not introduced to avoid creating steric hindrances. In addition, the\nPES-H1FY H184S variant was simulated, in which the mutation site is located near a highly\nconserved tryptophan (PES-H1: W155, LCC: W190) adjacent to the binding cleft and whose\n’wobbling’ presumably increases catalytic activity.45 Mutation of H184 to a serine is likely\nto increase the flexibility of this tryptophan due to the lower steric requirements of serine.\nThis resulted in a total of 14 mutation sites that were evaluated for each enzyme. For\neach mutant, an HREMD simulation was performed (see TableS1 for the list of HREMD\nsimulations) and the FES calculated as described above. In many cases the overall goal of the\nin silicomutations to facilitate PET-5mer entry into the active site was achieved. For these\ncases the FES is shown in Fig.S7, and they include mutations with improved stabilization\nof productive states (PES-H1FY: S68A, D93A; LCCIG: T211G, N246A), reduced interaction\nin non-productive states (PES-H1FY: S68A, R91A, D93A, N212A; LCCIG: T192G, S241G),\nor smoother transitions towards productive states without intermediate states where the\nPET-5mer could get trapped (PES-H1FY: S68A, D93A; LCCIG: HIS164A, T211G, S241G,\nN246A).

The percentage weight\nloss of the PET films shown in Fig.4 indicates that none of the variants resulted in a signifi-\ncant increase in the degradation activity. PES-H1FY R91A, LCCICCG T192G, and LCCICCG\nN246A showed significantly lower degradation activity than PES-H1FY and LCCICCG, re-\nspectively. Interestingly, these are also the three variants with the least promising FES\nprofiles among the ten selected variants (Fig.S7). The FES improvements in these mutants\nwere mainly related to the destabilization of the non-productive states, while the productive\nstate did not gain in stability. In LCCIG N246A, on the other hand, while the productive\nstate was stabilized, also a non-productive state at SER–C distances of≈6.5Å became more\nstable, which could explain the reduction in activity for this variant. In addition, there is\nalso the possibility that other factors may influence the experimental outcome and thus mask\nimprovements due to mutations. It should also be mentioned that the reproducibility of the\nexperiments was problematic despite uniform experimental conditions in all experiments,\nwhich we suggest can be attributed to influences of the inherent properties of the PET films\nsuch as crystallinity or molecular weight distribution.16\nTo reduce potential masking effects and identify subtle effects on individual steps in\nPET degradation, we analyzed the degradation kinetics using a previously described tur-\nbidimetric assay using PET nanoparticles (PET-NP) that measures turbidity changes at\n600nm over time.14,69 Here, not only the substrate load[S0] was varied while maintaining\n25\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Therefore, we performed\nHREMD simulations to increase the sampling of the conformational space of PET. In these\nsimulations, the energy function of PET is changed in a way that the energy barriers for\nits conformational changes become smaller. We applied these changes to five of the six\nreplicas we considered per HREMD simulation, with the height of the barriers decreasing\nwith increasing replica number. The changes applied to the energy function correspond to\nincreased simulation temperatures, which we will use in the following discussion. For the\nstarting structures of these HREMD simulations, we extracted three conformations from\nthe previous 2µs MD simulations, in which the binding of the enzyme to a PET bulk was\ninvestigated, with the selection criterion of a distance between the catalytic serine and PET\nof at most 5Å. In addition, we retained only the PET-9mer closest to the enzyme and\nremoved four units from it, leaving a PET-5mer closest to the catalytic serine (Fig.5A). This\nresulted in different starting structures for both enzymes, which were submitted to HREMD\nsimulations with 115ns per replica. For LCC we performed five HREMD simulations and\nfour for PES-H1 (Tab.S1). In these simulations, and later in the simulations for LCCIG and\nPES-H1FY, we found that one of these three starting structures (designated 4thL) had the\nhighest number of PET-5mer entry events. Therefore, for the later HREMD simulations\nof the enzyme variants, this particular starting structure was preferentially used, unless the\nmutation site was significantly closer to the PET-5mer in another starting structure, which\nwas then used instead. These HREMD simulations enabled to observe several entry events\nof the PET-5mer into the active site and how this led to the formation of productive binding\nstates, which we distinguish into pro-S and pro-R states (Fig.5B).

Once the entry is complete, the system\nremains in low-energy replicas. This observation explains why PET entry did not occur in the\nearlier conventional MD simulations and confirms our assumption that this process involves\na significant energy barrier that must be overcome. Since the current results could be due to\nthe changes we made to the system, i.e., removing the PET bulk, we performed conventional\n115ns MD simulations for the three HREMD starting structures (two LCC and one PES-H1\nsimulations) to see if PET-5mer entry still occurs. However, this was not the case and no\nproductive PET state were sampled. Additional MD simulations were conducted at 343K,\na temperature recently proposed as optimal for enzymatic PET hydrolysis.4,64 These simu-\nlations are crucial for surpassing the energy barrier for PET entry. The simulations resulted\nin pro-R and pro-S states for PES-H1 and LCC when simulated with a single PET-5mer.\nOne of the LCC simulations that encompassed the entire PET bulk yielded a pro-S state.\nIn order to decipher the source of this energy barrier, we conducted further analyses\nand defined specific criteria for the identification of productive PET-5mer entries and their\ncorresponding outside, entry, and inside phases: (1) An entry leading to the adoption of\na productive state, either pro-S or pro-R, must have taken place and involve a decrease\nin the SER–C distance from >6Å (outside phase) to <4Å (inside phase). (2) The entry\nphase must last at least 100ps and a maximum of 5ns to minimize noise through in and out\nmovements. (3) The inside and outside phases must each last at least 1ns. The inside phase\nends when the SER–C distance exceeds 6Å and the outside phase ends when this distance\nfalls below 4Å, or, in the case of more gradual changes, when the SER–C distance exceeds\n4Å on average over the entire inside phase and falls below 6Å on average over the entire\nouter phase. Based on these criteria, we identified 29 productive entries for LCC and 15\nfor PES-H1, corresponding to 4.35% and 6.49% of the corresponding MD frames. Of these\nentries, 13 and 7 resulted in pro-S poses for LCC and PES-H1, respectively, while the others\n18\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The pro-R pose was identified via docking studies performed by Tournier\net al.,3 but others later found in QM/MM studies that the pro-S pose is energetically more\nfavorable63,65 and that robust binding of a state unfavorable for hydrolysis could inhibit\nPET degradation activity.66 Thus, although several pro-R poses were sampled in our study,\nhydrolysis is expected to occur mainly via pro-S poses. Our analysis of the PET-5mer\nbinding events further shows that the two units that share the ester bond to be hydrolyzed\nare tightly bound to the enzyme, which is required for the reaction to proceed, while the\nother PET units interact rather loosely with the enzyme and remain flexible. This finding is\nevidenced by the different snapshots in Figs.5B, S3 and S5, which show the conformational\nfreedom of PET units that do not interact directly with the active site. This finding is in\ncontrast to earlier assumptions about a long binding cleft that has several subsites to bind\nseveral PET units simultaneously.46,67\nFromtheanalysisthusfaritcanbeconcludedthatPEThastoovercomeanenergybarrier\nfor entry into the active site to adopt productive conformations. This energy barrier could\nbe driven by conformational changes of PET to fit into the binding cleft.

For LCCICCG the results are less clear.

This generated a large dataset that is suitable for a\nmeaningful principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA was applied to the distances of\nthe PET-5mer ester carbon, which becomes productively bound after entry, to all Cα atoms\nof the corresponding enzyme within 10Å. This allows to capture the dynamics during the\nPET-5mer entry without introducing bias by pre-selecting specific residues. The resulting\nprincipal components (PCs) are used to calculate the free energy (∆G) along the first two\nPCs, which account for 86% of the variance and are shown as FESs in Fig.S9A,B.\nTo identify productive and non-productive states in these FES presentations, we pro-\njected them into the PC1–PC2 space (indicated by green and rose color in Fig.S9A,B). This\nshows that the productive states are clearly separated from non-productive states and that\nthe productive states are localized in the∆G minima regions. We further analyzed the\ncontributions of amino acids mainly involved in the PET-5mer entry by their contributions\nto PC1, which reveals 49 relevant amino acid positions, which account for 62% of the data\nvariance (Fig.S9C). The involvement of so many positions highlights how complicated the\nentry pathway of a polymer such as PET into the active enzyme site is. This complexity also\nchallenges the applicability of collective variable-based methods, such as metadynamics,77\nfor the targeted sampling of entry pathways. HREMD simulations, as used in this study, do\nnot restrict the conformational PET space to be sampled, but simply increase the space that\nis generally sampled, thus providing a suitable approach. Inspection of the FES along the\nPCs of the enzyme–PET contacts also shows that the PET-5mer does not enter the active\nsite via an exclusive pathway, but has three such preferential entry routes in both enzymes.\nFor each of these three pathways, a representative trajectory is projected onto the FES and\nalso structures of both enzymes (Fig.7).\n29\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As for\nthe second-preferred route, the LCC shows a preference for the direct entry of PET-5mer\nas found in the second pathway, which is also better defined than in PES-H1, while in the\nlatter these arguments apply to the third pathway.\nThe pathway preference may be influenced by the interactions with certain residues and\ntheir contribution to PC1, the principal component that mainly distinguishes the three path-\nways from each other (Fig.S9C). Amino acids with a negative contribution predominantly\ninfluence the negative range of PC1, impacting the first pathway located at negative PC1\nvalues. Conversely, amino acids with a positive contribution primarily affect the positive\nrange of PC1, influencing the third pathway situated at positive PC1 values. The magni-\ntude of the amino acid contributions reflects their respective strengths. The second pathway\ncorresponds to PC1≈0 and therefore has no significant amino acid contributions along PC1.\nThe positions mutated in PES-H1 and LCC correspond to amino acids that contribute to\nPC1. Among the three positions mutated in the more active IG and FY variants, two\ncontribute negatively to PC1 (PES-H1FY: 94/LCCICCG: 127 and PES-H1FY: 92) and thus\nprimarily affect the first pathway, which has been identified as the most important for both\nenzymes. The other mutation in LCCICCG contributes to the positive PC1 direction and\nconsequently to the third pathway (LCCICCG: 243). For several of the positions that we\npreviously analyzed in terms of the FES reflecting their interaction with the PET-5mer, we\nhere find a strong contribution to PC1. In particular, position 68 of PES-H1 makes the\nlargest contribution to PC1, which turned out to be the PES-H1FY variant with the highest\ncatalytic efficiency after its mutation from serine to alanine (Tab.1). Together with position\n209 in PES-H1 (which corresponds to position 243 in LCC and emerged as important for the\nLCCICCG’s activity3), position 68 lines one end of the catalytic binding cleft and might, thus,\nconstitute a sterical hindrance when the predominant entry pathway is attempted (Fig.S6) .\nFor LCC, we had identified position 241 as a promising mutation site, which also contributes\nto the first entry pathway.\n31\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Using 70 mW laser power, Qdots were observed \nto reversibly bind to the surface, and the binding duraNons followed a biexponenNal with a fast \nphase of 1.5 ± 0.08 s (faster than the PETase fast phase of 2.7 s) and a slow phase of 51.1 ± 2.0 s \n(Fig. 2A) . We hypothesized that the slow Nme constant may be due to nonspeciﬁc and/or \nirreversible binding of Qdots  to the surface, with the apparent unbinding rate being due to \nphotobleaching or blinking of the Qdots.  I f this were the case, then  increasing laser power to \naccelerate bleaching should shorten the Nme constant of the slow phase. To test this, we repeated \nthe control Qdot experiment using a 150 mW laser illuminaNon  and found that the slow Nme \nconstant shortened from 51.1 s to 23.3 s, as expected, while the fast Nme constant remained at \n1.5 s (Fig. 2B).  This result is consistent with the slow phase being due to irreversible binding \nevents whose duraNons are truncated by photobleaching or blinking, rather than dissociaNon.  \nTo further validate our photobleaching hypothesis, we immobilized Qdots  on the surface and \nquanNﬁed their populaNon-level photobleaching rate. To do this, we ﬂowed 50 pM Qdots (lacking \nPETase) into the ﬂow cell without ﬁrst blocking the PET surface to prevent nonspeciﬁc adsorpNon, \nwashed away any free Qdots that did  not bind, and imaged these nonspeciﬁcally-bound Qdots \nunder conNnuous laser illuminaNon. T he average ﬂuorescence intensity of the image  fell \nexponenNally over Nme due to photobleaching of the immobilized Qdots (Fig. 2C). At 70 mW laser \npower, the Nme constant was 118 s, and at 150 mW laser power, the Nme constant fell to 76.3 s, \nconsistent with faster Qdot photobleaching at higher laser powers. This populaNon-level result \nreinforced our single-molecule result in Fig. 2AB, supporNng our conclusion that the slow Nme \nconstant in the PETase experiments (Fig. 1) is due to slow photobleaching of Qdots that are \nnonspeciﬁcally bound to the surface. \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Comparing the fast \nphases, which correspond to reversible binding, the hyperacNve mutant had a Nme constant of  \n4.0 ± 0.07 s (ﬁt ± SE of the ﬁt) , longer than the wild -type (2.7 ± 0.12 s), whereas the impaired \nvariant had a Nme constant of 1.7 ± 0.18 s, shorter than wild -type (Fig. 3A -C). These binding \nduraNons are consistent with the hyperacNve mutant having a higher PET binding aﬃnity, and the \nimpaired mutant having a lower binding aﬃnity than wild-type.   \nTo quanNfy the relaNve on-rates for PET binding, we quanNﬁed the binding frequency of the three \nPETase enzymes along with the Qdot control  (Fig. 3D) . Binding rates were normalized to the \nenzyme concentraNon and to the area of the microscope image. The binding rate of the impaired \nmutant, 1014 ± 282 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (mean ± SEM for N=7 movies) was similar to the wild-type rate \nof 1070 ± 310 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (N = 9).  Notably, the hyperacNve mutant landed more frequently, at \n2141 ± 254 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (N = 7) than wild-type.  Taken together, the results suggest that the \nhyperacNve mutant achieves a higher PET binding aﬃnity through both a faster on -rate and a \nslower oﬀ-rate.  Finally , the landing rate for  the Qdot control lacking PETase was 394 ± 113 / \nμm2 · s · M (N = 11), roughly 1/3 of wild-type PETase (Fig. 3D, dashed line). This nonspeciﬁc Qdot-\nPET interacNon in the absence of enzyme means that the observed landing rates of the three \nenzymes are somewhat overesNmated; it follows that the measured enhancement of the landing \nrate of the hyperacNve mutant is a lower limit of the eﬀect.

Thus, we repeated the single-molecule binding experiments \nin the presence of 4 mM pNPA. \npNPA reduced the binding duraNon of wild -type PETase and the hyperacNve variant, but  had \nnegligible eﬀect on the binding duraNons of the impaired mutant and the control Qdots lacking \nbound PETase (Fig. 4A). The clear eﬀects of pNPA on the wild-type and hyperacNve PETase provide \nfurther validaNon that the fast binding duraNon s are reporNng producNve interacNons of the \nenzymes with the immobilized PET.  In contrast, t he ﬁnding that the binding duraNon of the \nimpaired mutant did not change in the presence of pNPA calls into quesNon whether this mutant \nis speciﬁcally binding to the immobilized PET at all under our condiNons.  \nThe impacts of pNPA on the landing rate mirrors the eﬀects on the binding duraNon.  Speciﬁcally, \npNPA strongly diminished the landing rate of the wild -type and hyperacNve mutant, whereas it \nhad a negligible eﬀect on the landing rate of the impaired mutant and the Qdot control (Fig. 4B). \nTo beper separate out contribuNons to the landing rate from speciﬁc binding versus nonspeciﬁc \nbinding, we ﬁrst quanNﬁed the relaNve amplitudes of the fast and slow phases from the \nbiexponNal ﬁts (Fig. 4C). For wild -type and the hyperacNve mutant, the amplitudes of the fast \nduraNons were diminished by  pNPA, consistent with the inhibitor blocking the speciﬁc (fast) \ninteracNons. As expected, the relaNve amplitudes of the i mpaired mutant and the Qdot control \nwere unaﬀected by pNPA. In the ﬁnal analysis in Fig. 4D, we mulNplied the overall landing ra te \nfrom Fig. 4B by the relaNve amplitude of the fast phase from Fig. 4C. This corrected landing rate \ncorresponds to the degree to which the pNPA inhibitor blocks funcNonal binding of the PETases \nto the immobilized PET.  In summary, the pNPA results argue that both wild-type and hyperacNve \nmutant PETase bind speciﬁcally and reversibly to the PET, with hyperacNve mutant having a faster \nrelaNve on-rate.   \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Due to autoﬂuorescence of \nthe PET sample, labeling the PETases with standard ﬂuorophores such as rhodamine resulted in \nan insuﬃcient signal-to-noise for reliable detecNon. Instead, we turned to Qdots, which gave a \nvery good signal-to-noise, but suﬀered from non -speciﬁc binding to the PET. We explored using \nsurfactants to reduce nonspeciﬁc bin ding but were unable to ﬁnd condiNons that eliminated \nnonspeciﬁc binding while retaining speciﬁc binding.  Thus, we carried out a series of control \nexperiments to determine source of the fast and slow Nme constants we idenNﬁed in our \nbiexponenNal dwell Nmes ﬁts. \nBy characterizing Qdots  lacking bound PETase and varying laser intensity to characterize \nphotobleaching, we concluded that the slow Nme constant (~tens of seconds) of our \nbiexponenNal ﬁt to the dwell Nme distribuNons was due to nonspeciﬁc binding.

This conclusion comes from the fact that dissociaNon of the enzyme from the substrate \nis either through unbinding before catalysis (koﬀ) or via a catalyNc event followed by dissociaNon \nfrom the “product” (cleaved PET in our case), with rate kcat. It should be noted that the catalyNc \nevent may be considerably faster than this, meaning that the lumped kcat parameter is rate -\nlimited by product release.  However, the funcNonal turnover rate would be the same in this case, \nas would the apparent kcat that we observed.  This slow turnover rate presumably is related to \nthe crystallinity of PET ﬁlm and the fact that experiments were performed at room temperature. \nPrevious work showed that higher degrees of crystallinity lead to greater resistance of PET to \nenzymaNc hydrolysis (16, 17).

Our kcat of 0.37 s-1 does seem slow; however, published PETase acNviNes to \ndate have generally been characterized by degradaNon of the substrate  (6, 7) rather than the \nactual turnover rate of the enzyme.  Thus, to our knowledge there are no values in the literature \nfor the kcat of PETase on crystalline PET with which to compare our inferred rate. \nThe enzyme dissociaNon rates that we measure also provide insights into how mutaNons alter the \nkineNc parameters of the enzymes.  We interpret our data in the context of the simple Michaelis-\nMenten model showin in Fig. 5. The hyperacNve mutant, S238F/W159H was chosen by AusNn et \nal. because the mutaNons narrowed the acNve cleg of the enzyme to match that of other \ncuNnases (6).

Instead, the data argue that the rate of reversible binding from the substrate, koﬀ, is \nslowed in the hyperacNve mutant. The ﬁrst eﬀect of slowing koﬀ is a lower KM, which will improve \nperformance at sub-saturaNng substrate concentraNons. The second eﬀect is that for every \nenzyme-substrate encounter, there is a higher probability that the enzyme will hydrolyze the \nsubstrate (with 𝑝'$($+,-.- =\n/%\"$\n/%\"$0/&!!\n; Fig. 5) rather than simply unbinding without acNng on the \nsubstrate (with probability 𝑝123.24 =\n/&!!\n/%\"$0/&!!\n).   \nWe can also use this analysis to interpret  the impaired mutant.

Among the extant cutinases, the highest PETase 156 \nactivities were observed for LCC (A 260 nm = 0.34 ± 0.03), BhrPETase from bacterium HR29 157 \n(A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01), and a previously engineered variant of LCC with the mutations 158 \nF243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G (LCC ICCG) 6 (A260 nm = 0.54 ± 0.07), with other cutinases 159 \nshowing lower activity (Figure 1B). Of the 48 ancestral variants, we observed PETase activity 160 \nfor a number of ancestral cutinases from a diverse range of trees (Figure 1C). Several variants 161 \n(1_533, 35_442, 55_547, 70_439, 70_440, and 85_456) exhibited similar activity to the most 162 \nactive extant cutinases, LCC and BhrPETase. From this group, we selected ancestors from 163 \ntree 35, node 442 (35_442; A260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and tree 55, node 547 (55_547; A260 nm = 164 \n0.59 ± 0.09), for further investigation. Notably, these two ancestors belonged to equivalent 165 \npositions from two independent phylogenetic trees (Figure 1D-F), representing the most 166 \nrecent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2, and sharing 98.5% sequence identity to one 167 \nanother.  168 \n 169 \nWithin the dataset of 48 ancestral sequences, 12 represent the same phylogenetic node (the 170 \nmost recent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2) over 12 different phylogenetic 171 \nbackgrounds. Of these, 9 exhibited PETase activity while 3 were inactive on PET. 172 \nInterestingly, the PETase ancestor 55_547 and the inactive ancestor 10_543 both represent 173 \nequivalent positions (the most recent common ancestor of TfCut2 and LCC) in their respective 174 \nphylogenetic backgrounds and differ by only 9/261 positions, yet 55_547 has activity against 175 \nPET and 10_543 does not. The functional differences between these sequences arise solely 176 \nfrom the topology of the phylogenetic tree used to reconstruct them and drastically alters how 177 \nthe evolution of PETase activity could be inferred. For example, in the case of the 55_547 178 \nphylogeny, PETase activity appears to be a promiscuous ancestral trait that existed prior to 179 \nthe discovery of extant PETases (such as LCC and Thermobifida cutinases), whereas the 180 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As both topologies failed rejection by the approximately unbiased (AU)41 test 183 \nand are statistically indifferent at representing the observed alignment data, it is not possible 184 \nto reject one of these hypotheses purely from a phylogenetic perspective. We also observe 185 \nno correlation between the mean posterior probability of an ancestor and its activity 186 \n(Supplementary Figure  5). This observation is somewhat counterintuitive, as the mean 187 \nposterior probability of a sequence, which is the statistical confidence in the identity of a 188 \nreconstructed ancestor, is often used to discriminate between poorly reconstructed sequences 189 \n(and hence likely to be less fit) and those that are likely to be functional and fit 40. Together, 190 \nthese results highlight the importance of sampling diverse phylogenetic backgrounds during 191 \nASR when accessing the functional sequence space of a protein family as minor phylogenetic 192 \nincongruencies can translate into significant functional differences in (equivalent) 193 \nreconstructed ancestral sequences. 194 \n 195 \nStructural characterization and analysis of ancestral cutinases. 196 \n 197 \nA comparative structural and sequence analysis of inactive and active ancestors suggests 198 \nthat PET hydrolysis appears to be a trait that is evolutionarily accessible from within the 199 \ncutinase background. Unlike the I. sakaiensis PETase, which emerged through conformational 200 \noptimization of the first - and second-shells via obvious selection within the active site 42–44, 201 \nPETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages appears to emerge through non -202 \nspecific and likely neutral mutations that are often distal to the active site ( Figure 2A-C). 203 \nIndeed, analysis of ancestral cutinase sequences reveals virtually no differences in the PET 204 \nbinding sites between PETase active and inactive variants ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). 205 \nFurthermore, mutations associated with a gain -of-function vary between the different 206 \nphylogenetic trees used to reconstruct the ancestral sequences. For example, ancestors 207 \n55_547 and 35_442 are each separated by 9 unique mutations from their closest relatives 208 \nwithout PETase activity (ancestors 10_543  with A15S, A36V, T49S, T92S, N109D, R114S, 209 \nN145R, I180V, S226A and 75_539 with A36V, T49D, T92S, M105Q, R114S, S124N, R167T, 210 \nP199S, A226S, respectively). Of these loss of function mutations, 3 are shared between either 211 \nbackground, 5 are unique and one is a reversion (S226A for 55_547, A226S for 35_442).   212 \nIntuitively, a combination (with at least one) of these mutations are required to be fixed in 213 \neither respective cutinase background to impart PETase activity. Similarly, ancestor 10_543 214 \nis separated by 8 mutations from its closest  relative with PETase activity (70_439 with E28Q, 215 \nS49D, S124N, R145N, V180I, P199S, S215T, A226S); of the 8 mutations associated with 216 \ngain-of-function in the background of 10_543, only 3 are specifically shared with gain -of-217 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Both ancestors crystallized in the C222 space group at 247 \nresolutions of 1.5 - 1.8 Å (Supplementary Table 1). Structural analysis revealed the formation 248 \nof domain-swapped dimers (Figure 2D). The observation of domain swapping, likely induced 249 \nby the high protein concentration in the crystallization conditions, suggests an intrinsic 250 \nflexibility of the C -terminus, a characteristic commonly observed in proteins previously 251 \ncharacterized to form domain-swapped dimers47. Given the flexible nature of the C-terminus, 252 \nit was hypothesized that introducing a disulfide bond to constrain this region into forming an 253 \nintramolecular β-sheet would enhance enzyme stability (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the chosen 254 \nsite for the disulfide bond coincided with the predicted Ca2+/Mg2+ binding site of the ancestors 255 \nbased on homology to extant cutinases, a region previously targeted for disulfide bond 256 \nengineering in TfCut2 and LCC for improved thermostability and PETase activity 6,48,49. We 257 \nintroduced the disulfide mutation N20 6C/S253C to ancestor 55_547 and experimental 258 \ncharacterization of the resulting mutant demonstrated an approximately 2 -fold improvement 259 \nin whole-cell activity (A 260 nm  = 1.22 ± 0.22) ( Figure 2F) and a 1.5 -fold increase in soluble 260 \nexpression levels compared to the 55_547 background determined by Bradford assay 261 \n(Supplementary Figure 5 ). In combination with our comparative analysis of the selected 262 \ninactive and active ancestors, the successful optimization of PETase activity via the 263 \nintroduction of a disulfide bond distal to the active site illustrates that PETase activity within 264 \nthe cutinase family can emerge and be enhanced through mechanisms that extend beyond 265 \nthe structural reconfiguration of the active site. It is therefore likely that activity optimization is, 266 \nat least in part, being driven by thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization. 267 \n 268 \n  269 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Here, we define ambiguity as any site where at least two amino 281 \nacids are reconstructed with a posterior probability of >= 0.2. This provided a high resolution 282 \nmutagenic map of the local sequence space around either of the ancestral PETase variants. 283 \nAmbiguously reconstructed sites were spatially distributed over the protein and not localized 284 \nto any specific functional area ( Supplementary Figure 7). Having already established that 285 \nthe mean posterior probability of an ancestral sequence is a poor indicator of PETase activity 286 \n(Supplementary Figure 4B) and that relatively minor changes in the cutinase sequence can 287 \ndrastically alter PETase activity, we hypothesized that the neighborhood of evolutionarily 288 \npossible (albeit less probable) sequences may contain mutations that benefit PETase activity. 289 \nThis hypothesis was guided by recent ASR studies on the I. sakaiensis PETase branch of the 290 \ncutinase phylogeny where PETase activity appeared to emerge transiently within ancestral 291 \nlineages50. Experimental characterization revealed that all of the alternate reconstructions of 292 \nancestors 55_547 and 35_442 demonstrated PETase activity that was comparable (or 293 \nreduced) to either respective ancestral background (Figure 3A-B).  294 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The 7 selected mutations, E1 4D, E28Q, A36V, S52A (in 55_547), F9 4L, 311 \nS196A, and H247S, were recombined in various combinations from 2 to 5 point mutations in 312 \nthe background of 35_442 and 55_547.

Specifically, 10 recombined variants in the 321 \nbackground of 55_547 showed increased PETase activity, with the most active being 322 \nE14D/E28Q/A36V (A 260 nm = 1.20 ± 0.26), E2 8Q/S196A (A 260 nm = 1.08 ± 0.05), and 323 \nE28Q/S52A/S196A (A260 nm = 1.03 ± 0.09). Similarly, 14 recombinations in the background 324 \nof 35_442 demonstrated increased activity, with the most active being E28Q/S196A (A260 nm 325 \n= 1.42 ± 0.29), E28Q/F94L (A260 nm = 0.99 ± 0.17), and E14D/H247S (A260 nm = 0.77 ± 0.08). 326 \nInterestingly, we identified 17 recombined variants that exhibited improved PETase activity 327 \nrelative to LCC ICCG, the most active extant variant in the study, with 35_442 E2 8Q/S196A, 328 \ndisplaying ~2.5-fold higher activity. 329 \n 330 \nThe mutational analysis of the recombined variants highlighted E2 8Q as a key mutation, 331 \npresent in 14 of the 17 variants that demonstrated enhanced activity compared to the 332 \nengineered LCC ICCG variant. This suggests a positive effect of E2 8Q on PETase activity; 333 \nhowever, this was only observed in the presence of other mutations from the recombinations. 334 \nThe context dependence of E2 8Q is especially significant when considering the double 335 \nmutation E28Q/S196A, which was among the most active in both ancestral backgrounds. 336 \nWhen assessed independently in the 55_547 background, the E2 8Q mutation adversely 337 \naffected activity (A260 nm = 0.00 ± 0.00), and the S19 6A mutation similarly led to a reduction 338 \nin activity relative to the ancestor (A260 nm = 0.16 ± 0.02). However, the combination of these 339 \nmutations resulted in a significant increase in activity beyond the additive effects of the single 340 \nmutations (A260 nm = 1.08 ± 0.05), indicative of positive epistatic interactions. 341 \n 342 \nRuggedness analysis reveals epistasis in recombined mutations. 343 \n 344 \nWe next analyzed the topology of the PETase fitness landscape over the 196 cutinase 345 \nsequences characterized in this study. This was done both to build a holistic overview of 346 \nPETase evolution and function in the cutinase family and to assess the effectiveness of this 347 \napproach in exploring new -to-nature fitness peaks across functional sequence space. To 348 \nachieve this, we embedded cutinase sequences as nodes in a network graph where edges 349 \nconnect each node to its k nearest (Euclidean) neighbors. The scheme used to embed 350 \nsequences therefore dictates the topology of the network graph. When this is the one -hot 351 \nencoding (OHE), the Euclidean distance between nodes in the network graph is proportional 352 \nto the number of mutations between the sequences they represent. The OHE graph network 353 \ntherefore captures PETase activity as a function of the mutations between sequences when 354 \nthe signal over the graph is the measured PETase activity (Figure 5A).  355 \n 356 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In this space, ancestral and extant cutinases form homogenous, 366 \nrandom clusters (Figure 5A). The alternate reconstructions of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 367 \nand their recombinations are grouped as closely connected clusters around their respective 368 \nancestral backgrounds. Despite their comparable PETase activity, sequences in both 369 \nbackgrounds are resolved as independent components that share few direct edge 370 \nconnections, suggesting that the PETase fitness landscape is multi -modal (i.e. there are 371 \nmultiple solution spaces to competent PETase activity) when considering only naive, residue-372 \nwise OHE sequence embeddings.  373 \n 374 \nWe then reconstructed the PETase fitness landscape in a learned representation space. To 375 \nensure that local features of the cutinase sequence space were captured by a PLM, we used 376 \na recently described method of local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE)36. In brief, LASE 377 \ntrains a small and family-specific deep learning model on ancestrally reconstructed sequence 378 \ndatasets. The features learned by LASE capture the functional properties of proteins, such as 379 \ncatalytic efficiency, in a non -linear space that is not interpretable with simple mutational 380 \ndistances. Embedding in LASE can therefore reveal topological features of the fitness map 381 \nthat are obfuscated in an OHE embedding.  382 \n 383 \nSequences in the LASE embedding space cluster according to their relative fitness and how 384 \nthey were sampled (e.g. extant, ancestral, alternate or recombined; Figure 5B). For example, 385 \nall point mutations from alternate reconstructions and recombinations group together in a 386 \nsingle connected component in the LASE space, irrespective of the genetic background 387 \n(ancestors 55_547 or 35_442) they were introduced into. Moreso, ancestral and extant 388 \nsequences cluster into disconnected components, despite their often high degree of site-wise 389 \nsequence similarity. Indeed, the LASE representation space is highly structured relative to the 390 \nOHE space, where ancestral and extant sequences co-occur across distinct identity groups in 391 \nthe network graph. This indicates that our sequence sampling strategy is highly structured and 392 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We define ruggedness as the non -linearity between the fitness of a 397 \nsequence and its neighbors in the network graph. We use the Dirichlet energy of the graph, 398 \nwhich describes the non-linearity of a signal over a graph, to measure this 36,51,52. In order to 399 \nmake the Dirichlet energy interpretable as a node-wise local quantity, we calculate it over each 400 \nsubgraph in the network defined by an edge-length of exactly 1, thus reducing its interpretation 401 \nto the deviation from linearity a node demonstrates relative only to its immediate neighbors; 402 \nthe fitness signal over the network graph changes as a linear function (i.e. is smooth) over 403 \nnodes of the graph that are characterized by low local DEs. The local Dirichlet energy is 404 \ntherefore a descriptor of how confounded by epistasis a sequence is. This analysis revealed 405 \nthat the fitness landscape is most rugged over the cutinase variants with the greatest PETase 406 \nactivity. Indeed, the node with the single highest local Dirichlet energy is also the fitness peak 407 \n(ancestor 55_547_E28Q/S196A). Importantly, this was true for both OHE and LASE network 408 \ngraphs (Figure 5C; Supplementary Figure 9 ), indicating that the combinatorial mutations 409 \nE28Q/S196A in the 55_547 background would be unlikely to be introduced through a stepwise 410 \nmutagenesis approach due to the relatively low activity of each single mutation in isolation. 411 \nTogether, these analyses demonstrate that mASR can effectively guide protein engineering 412 \nby discovering evolutionary features that are not immediately apparent, and can help navigate 413 \nrugged regions of sequence space to find fit enzyme variants that are not rationally obvious. 414 \n 415 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This method allowed us 427 \nto reconstruct and analyze ancestral cutinases across 20 diverse phylogenetic topologies, 428 \nmoving beyond the constraints of a single -tree perspective. Our experimental 429 \ncharacterizations of 20 extant and 48 ancestral cutinases unveiled a wide spectrum of 430 \nactivities against amorphous PET film (A260 nm = 0.00 - 0.59). Of particular interest were two 431 \nancestors, 35_442 (A 260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and 55_547 (A 260 nm = 0.59 ± 0.09), each 432 \nrepresenting the most recent common ancestor of LCC 13 and TfCut25 on independent trees 433 \nand exhibiting similar activity to the most active extant cutinases, LCC (A 260 nm = A260 nm = 434 \n0.34 ± 0.03) and BhrPETase (A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01). Notably, the use of mASR was crucial 435 \nin uncovering the variability of ancestrally reconstructed sequences, as it revealed that 436 \nequivalent nodes from independent phylogenetic topologies exhibited highly varied activity 437 \ndespite all topologies being equally valid representations of the underlying sequence 438 \nalignment based on the AU -test. While some ancestors were inactive, others showed 439 \nsignificant PETase activity comparable to characterized extant PETases. These observations 440 \nhighlight the utility of the mASR method in improving both the success and robustness of ASR 441 \napplications in protein engineering. By embracing a wider array of evolutionary scenarios, 442 \nmASR allowed for a more comprehensive and reliable identification of functional sequences 443 \nrelative to a single -tree approach. Multiplexed ASR may therefore become an important 444 \ncomponent of ASR- and evolutionary-guided enzyme design strategies in the future.  445 \n  446 \nOur sequence and structural analysis of active and inactive ancestral cutinases provided 447 \ninsights on the evolutionary emergence of PETase activity in the cutinase family. In particular, 448 \nour findings suggest that PETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages has 449 \nemerged through neutral mutations that are distal to the active site, rather than specific 450 \nchanges localized to the active site itself, as observed in the evolution of I. sakaiensis 451 \nPETase37. Our detailed examination of ancestors 35_442 and 55_547, along with their closest 452 \ninactive counterparts, highlighted unique gain-of-function mutations leading to PETase activity 453 \nfrom these distinct phylogenetic backgrounds. These findings imply the existence of multiple, 454 \ndistinct evolutionary pathways for acquiring PETase functionality and indicate that PETase 455 \nactivity is readily accessible within the cutinase family.  456 \n 457 \nOur structural analysis also revealed the formation of domain -swapped dimers between 458 \nadjacent symmetry mates in the crystal structures of the ancestral variants 35_442 and 459 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

While possibly an artifact of the crystallization conditions, this observation suggests 460 \na certain degree of structural flexibility in the C-terminus of these ancestors even in solution. 461 \nBased on this observation, we introduced a disulfide bond in the C -terminus of ancestor 462 \n55_547 that coincided with the predicted Ca 2+/Mg2+ binding site, a strategy homologous to 463 \nsimilar successful modifications in TfCut2 and LCC that were observed to improve stability 464 \nand activity6,48,49.

Introducing these 69 alternate reconstructions as single mutations into 35_442 and 472 \n55_547, we observed that most mutations were either neutral or decreased PETase activity 473 \nrelative to the ancestral background. However, when we recombined a random subset of the 474 \nalternate reconstructions, we observed several recombinations in the background of both 475 \n35_442 (E2 8Q/S196A) and 55_547 (E1 4D/E28Q/A36V) that displayed increased PETase 476 \nactivity, not only relative to the initial ancestors, but also to an engineered variant of LCC with 477 \nenhanced activity, LCC ICCG 6. Notably, the most active recombinations exhibited activity 478 \nimprovements that exceeded the additive effects predicted from their individual mutations, 479 \nhighlighting positive epistatic interactions that contribute to their PETase activity. 480 \n 481"}

The final yields of all the enzymes were \naround 16 mg/liter of bacterial culture . Wild type LCC, a naturally occurring PETase , has a Tm of 84.7 °C. \nThis enzyme has been previously engineered by Tournier et al. ,15 leading to the LCC-ICCG variant with a \nreported Tm of 94.0°C (92.9 °C in our own assessment, a difference that could be attributed to that fact \nthat, for Tm measurements, Tournier et al. used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), whereas we used \ncircular dichroism (CD) ). After our enzyme design campaign, we tested the thermal stability of the six \nengineered designs (Table 3) and we found that the C09 (Tm = 97.0 °C) and X05 (Tm = 96.2 °C) variants have \na higher Tm than the reference LCC-ICCG (Tm = 92.9 °C). The X09 (Tm = 92.3 °C) variant showed a limited \nimprovement in the thermal stability, while C08 (Tm = 85.6 °C) showed a slight decrease in the thermal \nstability (Figure S 2-3). For the P06 and P08 variants, we did not set out to determine the ir melting \ntemperature because of their negligible enzymatic activity (see below). \n \nTable 3. Assessed melting temperature for different PETase s and improvement with respect to the  LCC wild type \nenzyme. The estimation of Tm is sensitive to the experimental setup and conditions, which could explain the difference \nbetween the reported Tm and the Tm determined by us. For proper comparison, we assessed the Tm of LCC-ICCG using \nthe same setup that we used for the measurement of the T m of our engineered enzymes.

To assess enzymatic activity, s amples were harvested at multiple time points and \nanalyzed by HPLC for the quantification of TPA production (Figure S8). Minor degradation products (MHET \nand BHET) were also assessed (Figure S9-S10). We used an enzyme concentration of 40 nM and a PET film \nof 8.4 mg in a 2 ml microplate tube to evaluate the PET degradation activity of the different mutants. The \nenzyme concentration corresponds to ≈0.3 mg ENZYME/gPET, a ratio lower than the one reported in the \noriginal LCC-ICCG paper (3 mgENZYME/gPET), but in agreement with the range reported in the literature (0.2 \nto 3 mgENZYME/gPET).17,21,32,33 The experiments were done at 68°C, the temperature at which PET degradation \nis typically carried out in bioreactors at industrial scale to work below the glass transition temperature of \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

If we exclude the first few hours, where ICCG performs better, at 68°C the mean TPA \nconcentration at the different time points is significantly higher for the C09 mutant than for ICCG up until \nday 6 (144h, Figure 2A and S5-S8). Moreover, the specific activity of C09 is also significantly higher (≈2-\nfold) than that of the gold standard LCC-ICCG over the same length of time (Figure 2B). All other enzymes \nshow similar or weaker performances compared to LCC-ICCG (X09, C08, X05). At 68°C, complete sample \ndegradation could be observed with C09 already at day 4  (data not shown), a feature not seen with any \nof the other enzymes, including LCC-ICCG. The % of weight loss after 6 days of reactions for all the enzymes \nis shown in Figure 2C and in S11. To assess the stability and the activity of the enzymes in harsh conditions, \nwe also carried out the same experiments at 80  °C for 6 days. Also at this temperature, the mean TPA \nconcentration for the C09 mutant is higher than LCC-ICCG at all the time points  (Fig. 2D, S5-S8), albeit \nbeing greatly reduced in absolute terms compared to the reaction at 68 °C.

The position and \norientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242, and S265) overlaps perfectly with the catalytic triad in the \nparent enzymes (Figure 3A). Although we observe that increased stability leads to higher enzymatic \nactivity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is elusive. We hypothesize that the increase in \nstability provided by the additional surface charges in the C09 variant may help to keep the surface -\nexposed catalytic site in place even at high temperatures , such as those used to test the activity  of the \nenzyme (68°C). Indeed, all the mutations introduced in the design process are found mostly on the surface \nof the enzyme and away from the catalytic triad (Figure 3B), and are thus unlikely to affect the activity \ndirectly. Rather, the mutations may reduce the proportion of the enzyme that may denature over time, \nand/or prevent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The denaturation (and the consequent loss of \nactivity) is expected to be negligible only for T << T m. Therefore, by increasing the T m to 98°C the \ndenaturation effects may be significantly reduced at the working temperature (68°C), explaining the gains \nin activity of the C09 design. The stabilization of the catalytic triad is confirmed by MD simulations, which \nshow that at increasing temperatures C09  features a lower RMSF, in particular near the key catalytic \nresidue H242 (Figure 3C). \n \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A total of 150 pair mutations were generated and, based on the internal \nscoring system, the best 10 of them were retained for further testing.   \nOverall, our design campaign produced 29 different enzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD \nsimulations, and then ranked according to the method described in previous works .25–27 Briefly, we \nsolvated each molecular model with a 15 Å pad of TIP3P water and we introduced counter ions to \nneutralize the system charge, resulting in a final simulation box of ≈ 30.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass \nrepartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs 39. The systems were subjected to 1,000 energy \nminimization steps and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 300K with \nNAMD software,40 using AMBER19SB force field,41 non-bonded cut-off of 12 Å, rigid bonds and particle -\nmesh Ewald long -range electrostatics. During the equilibration simulation, the Cα atoms of the protein \nwere restrained by a 10 kcal mol−1 Å−2 spring constant. The 1 μs production runs were performed using a \nNVT ensemble whereby all the parameters (non -bonded cut -off, and PME) were the same as in the \nequilibration phase. All simulations were run in triplicates. Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) were \nmonitored after each MD run to assess structural conver gence, while Root Mean Square Fluctuations \n(RMSF) were calculated to assess the improved stability of the design. As a result, the two best structures \nfrom each design series were selected, namely design C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09. \n \nProtein expression and purification \nThe different codon -optimized nucleotide sequences  of the designed PETase mutants were cloned in a \npET26b(+) bacterial expression vector  (Novagen), together with a C -terminal 6His-tag. All the different \nmutants were transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen).  A sample \nof 4 ml of an overnight culture of the selected strain grown in the presence of 50 µg/ml kanamycin were \ninoculated into 2L of Luria–Bertani broth (LB) at 37°C, supplemented with 50 mg/L kanamycin and grown \nuntil OD600 = 0.6. The expression was induced with isopropyl 1‐thio‐β‐D‐galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final \nconcentration of 0.1 mM followed by overnight incubation at 18°C and 220 rpm. Cells were collected by \ncentrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl) supplemented with \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The Ni affinity column was washed \nusing ten column volumes of buffer A. Before elution, five column volumes (CV) of buffer A supplemented \nwith 50mM imidazole w ere used to remove unspecific proteins from the resin. T hen, the bound His‐\ntagged enzyme was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 500 mM imidazole in a linear \ngradient. The protein eluted completely with 250mM imidazole. The eluted fraction was loaded onto a \nPD-10 desalting column pre‐equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl) for buffer \nexchange. Buffer exchange was performed simultaneously after the protein was purified. The desired \nprotein was concentrated to ≈2 mg/ml using an Amicon 20 centrifugal filter with a molecular cutoff of 10 \nKDa, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was assessed using a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher \nScientific). Sample purity was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The final yields of all the enzymes were around \n16 mg/liter of bacterial culture. \nCircular dichroism \nCircular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. CD \nwas performed to detect the secondary structure of different variants and to measure the thermostability \nof the enzyme. The spectra were determined with the following parameters: continuous scanning mode \nwith scanning speed of 50 nm/min, band width 0.1 nm, data pitch 0.1 nm at 20 °C. 1.0 mm path length \nquartz cuvette was used for 5 μM samples of different enzymes in 20mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl. \nThermal denaturation curves were measured in 1.0 mm path length cuvettes closed with a parafilm on \nprotein solutions. Protein denaturation was induced upon increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min \nfrom 20 °C to 120 °C. The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded at intervals of 0.2 °C using a 1-nm bandwidth \nand a response of 10 s. Using the Boltzmann function, the midpoints of the thermal-denaturation curves \n(Tm) were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal transition curve 42. Final data are the average of \nthree measurements. The secondary structures of all the different variants were measured at 200-250 nm \nwavelengths and 20 °C. Ellipticity was plotted versus wavelength with GraphPad Prism 10 software. Each \nrecorded spectrum was the average of three scans (See Supplementary Information Figure S2).   \nEnzymatic reaction \nBis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid \n(TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG) are the major depolymerization products of the activity of the enzymes on \nPET. These compounds can be separated efficiently on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column, thus allowing \na precise quantification of product formation. All enzyme reactions were performed at a concentration of \n40 nM at both 68 and 80 °C in quintuplicates in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes in the same reaction buffer \n(20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl ). Amorphous, 250 μm -thick PET films (product number \nES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow USA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a \nhole puncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4  mg, were then placed in 2 ml \nmicrocentrifuge tubes.   \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

HPLC analyses were \nperformed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus system equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven and an \nautosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 µm; \n4.6  150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column temperature was maintained at 40°C with a flow \nrate of 1 ml/min.  For the mobile phase, 0.1% H 3PO4 (solvent A) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The \nlinear gradient mode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 0 -15 min, 10-40% B; 15-18min, \n40-65% B; 18-20 min, 65% B; 20-23 min, 65-10% B; 23-25 min 10% B. At every time interval, 100 μL of the \nsample were collected from the reaction vial placed at the set temperature. The 0h–72h samples were \ndiluted 21 times (50µL of the provided sample was transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1 mL of \n10% MeCN + 0.1% H3PO4), whereas, 96h and 144h sampes – 101 times (10µL of the provided sample was \ntransferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1  mL of 10% MeCN + 0.1% H 3PO4). Detection was \naccomplished via measurement of UV adsorption at 220 nm; 20 μL of each sample was injected into the \nsystem and the degradation products were quantified against standard calibration curves ranged 0.1, 1.0, \n5.0, 10.0, 50.0 (for TPA and MHET) and 0.09, 0.9, 4.4 and 43.9 (for BHET) μg/mL. \nProtein crystallization  \nCrystals of the C09 mutant were grown at room temperature using the vapor diffusion method by mixing \na 2μL drop of a 10mg/mL protein sample with a 2μL drop of a solution containing 0.1M Sodium citrate \ntribasic dihydrate pH 5.6, 20% v/v 2 -Propanol, 20% w/v Polyethylene glycol 4,000.  Crystals, which  \nappeared after one week, were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant prior \nto X-ray diffraction data collection. \n \nStructure determination and refinement  \nFor the structure of the C09 mutant, the initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using \nPhaser43 and the atomic coordinates of  the crystal structure of a Leaf-branch compost bacterial cutinase \nhomolog (PDB entry 4EB0) as a search model. Refinement was performed by alternating rounds of \nREFMAC544 and manual adjustments in Coot .45 Water molecules were added both manually and \nautomatically using the Coot_refine tool from the CCP4 package.46 The crystallographic table is shown in \nthe SI file in Table S7. \nData availability \nThe final crystallographic coordinates of the crystal structures of the C09 mutant are available in the RCSB \nPDB (accession code: 8CMV)."}

Hence, starting from this variant, we set out to \nengineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal stability and enzymatic activity. The resulting C09 design \nfeatured a significant improvement in term s of thermal stability (Tm=97.0°C) with respect to the gold \nstandard LCC-ICCG (+4.1°C). Under optimal reaction conditions (68°C), the C09 design enzyme hydrolyzed \nlow-crystallinity PET materials  into TPA  with a 2-fold higher efficiency compared to  LCC-ICCG. We \nnicknamed this design \"DRK3”, in light of the introduced mutations (3 Aspartic acids, 3 Arginines, and 3 \nLysines). The DRK3 variant may represent a significant advancement towards PET biorecycling. However, \nfurther work will be needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant conditions. The DRK3 variant could \nalso provide the basis for further rounds of enzyme engineering. \nRecent studies reported in the literature adopted similar approaches to ours , introducing mutations to \nthe LCC-ICCG enzyme to boost its performance and reporting different degrees of success .17,32,35,36 \nHowever, as reported in relevant reviews,37,38 direct comparison of enzymatic performances is challenging \ndue to the numerous variables involved in the experimental settings (PET crystallinity, PET form, PET \nconcentration, enzyme concentration, temperature, salt type and concentration, pH,  etc.). In this light, \nonly a direct comparison with a recognized gold standard in the same experimental conditions can provide \nreliable information. \nAlthough the field of PETase engineering is very dynamic and is providing  highly optimized enzymes, \nseveral issues still need to be thoroughly investigated to improve enzymatic PET degradation.38 One of the \nmajor challenges is related to the economic viability of enzymatic degradation. Another challenge, more \ndirectly related to protein engineering, concerns the acidification of the medium due to the release of \nTPA, which reduces the performance of the PETase enzymes known to date. Hence, possible directions \nfor enzyme engineering research could be directed towards the design of acid-tolerant PETase enzymes."}

It has  been reported that  higher PETase loading leads to high degradation \nperformance and even low MHETase concentrations are sufficient to boost product release  and \ncompletely convert MHET to TPA.19 Based on this understanding, we hypothesized that attaching \nFAST-PETase at two different sites would allow higher FAST-PETase concentrations than single-\nsite attachment of FAST-PETase, promoting efficient and complete PET depolymerization. In our \napproach, w e utilized FAST PETase-Doc Rf (FP-Rf) and FAST PETase -Doc Cc (FP-Cc) for \nimmobilizing FAST-PETase on the surface scaffold in and MHETase -Doc Ct (MH-Ct) for \nMHETase immobilization (Figure 1).  \nWe determined the saturation concentration of FAST -PETase on the scaffoldin  by incubating \nequimolar concentrations of FP-Rf and FP-Cc with the yeast cells (Figure S1). This concentration \nof the FAST-PETase dockerin enzymes was used for activity assays on the PET film in this work. \nMeanwhile, when wild -type yeast cells (lacking the scaffoldin) were incubated with all three \nenzymes, we observed negligible TPA formation compared with scaffoldin display cells . This \nobservation confirmed minimal non-specific enzyme binding on the yeast surface in the absence \nof the scaffoldin (Figure 2). \nStudy of PET depolymerization performance of whole-cell biocatalyst \nFollowing incubation  of S. cerevisiae  whole cells with the PET film, we quantified reaction \nproducts in the supernatant using HPLC to monitor MHET and TPA formation. When only FAST-\nPETase dockerins were present on the scaffoldin , both MHET and TPA were formed (Figure 2 , \nFigure S2).  \nWhen MH-Ct was present on the scaffold in along with FP-Cc and FP-Rf, we observed complete \nPET depolymerization, yielding only TPA as the enzymatic reaction product, with no MHET \naccumulation detected  (Figure 2, Figure S2 ). This demonstrate s that each enzyme , including \nPETase and MHETase, was active after binding to the scaffoldin , and the PETase-MHETase pair \nwas able to completely depolymerize PET with no intermediate accumulation. As expected, MH-\nCt alone did not show any activity on the PET film (data not shown). \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This difference in performance \ncould be attributed to variance in enzyme localization and access to plastics. We also explored the \neffect of having FAST-PETase at two sites (with MHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin, aiming \nto further enhance the concentration of FAST-PETase in the depolymerization reaction. The three-\nenzyme system exhibited  up to 1.63 times  better depolymerization performance than the two -\nenzyme counterparts throughout Day 4, with mean TPA yields of 2013 µM. \nIt was observed that the  total product formation was significantly boosted when MH -Ct was co-\nimmobilized with FP-Rf and FP-Cc on the scaffoldin (Figure 2A, 2B). This could be attributed to \nthe inhibitory effect of MHET accumulation in the absence of MHETase, which has been shown \nto have a detrimental impact on PETase activity.20,21 \nThroughout Day 7 (Figure 2B), the whole cells remained active, with at least a 2-fold increase in \nTPA production relative to Day 4 . Notably, b inding of  FAST-PETase at multiple sites  (with \nMHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin proved extremely beneficial, resulting in a 1.4-fold increase \nrelative to FP-Rf (with MH-Ct) and a 1.8-fold increase relative to FP -Cc (with MH-Ct). A mean \nyield of 4.9 mM TPA was obtained after 7 days of incubation with the PET film when all three \nenzymes were bound to the scaffoldin . With these results, we  successfully demonstrated the \nadvantages of immobilizing FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin for efficient and \ncomplete PET depolymerization."}

The node edges indicate the detected paths, with width proportional to the\nfrequency of the connection appearing in the top 10 paths.\nGiven the high sequence similarity between IsPETase and FastPETase, particularly the\nidentical residues from 88 to 91 in bothenzymes,we hypothesisedthattheS269Tmutationin\nFastPETase might act through the same mechanism and produce similar effects asobserved\nin IsPETase. To investigate this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both\nFastPETase and its mutantFast_2.9,eachlasting1 µswithfivereplicates.The simulationsfor\nboth enzymes were prepared and analysed using the same methodology applied to the\nIsPETase simulations, with the sole difference beingtheir optimal temperature(Methods).The\nper residue weighted RMSF profiles of FastPETase and Fast_S269T displayed the same\nstabilising behaviour as the one observed for IsPETase (unpaired t-test, BH adj.\np-value=0.0161) (Fig.3c).\nTo corroborate if the lower fluctuations observed in the region of residues 88 to 91 for the\nS269T mutants are due to a stabilisation of the crystallographic orientation or due to a new\nconformation, the RootMeanSquareDeviation(RMSD) ofthebackboneatomsofresidues88\nto 91 was analysed. To properly capture different conformations with respect to the crystal\nstructure and not merely internal orientations of the loop, we aligned all simulation frames to\nthe crystal structure using the C-alpha carbons of all residues except for 88 to 91. Following\nthis alignment, we computed the RMSD for the backbone of residues 88 to 91 without\nadditional realignment. We then generated a probabilitydensitydistributionbycombiningdata\nfrom all replicates. For bothIsPETase and FastPETase, the S269T mutants showed a higher\npreference for conformations resembling thecrystallographicstructure,suggestingthatS269T\nmutantactsbystabilisingthisconformation(Fig.3d).\nWe then aligned the previously reported structure ofIsPETase with a hydroxyethyl-capped\nPET dimer docked53,54 witharepresentativestructureofthe loopconformationsdisplayinglow\ndeviations with the crystallographic pose (Fig. 3d, RMSD≃1.5 Å) and a representative\nstructure of the loop conformations with a high deviations (Fig. 3d, RMSD≃5 Å).

Although we did not find any direct evidence indicating the correlation between S269\nand DS2, instead we found that the DS2 could possibly be partially reduced (Supplementary\nFigs. 6b, 7, 8), and the absence of DS2 did not significantlyaffecttheactivityofIsPETase but\ncaused almost complete loss of activity in FastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 6c).Weinfer that\nin the WTIsPETase,theDS2islikelytoplayaregulatoryrather thanstructural roleandfurther\nstudieswill beneededtoclarifyfunctions(See also inSupplementarynote).\nTo get insights how the effect from S269T mutation may be traversing to ~28 Å away active\nsite, we analysed the shortest residue C-alpha fluctuation correlation paths connecting\nmutation to the residues of the active cleft using Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal\nPaths (WISP) method55.

In fact, Arnal et al testedtheenzymevariantLCCICCG,avariantknownfor its\nhigh efficiencyinindustrial applications,atalower temperatureof68°Cinsteadof72°C,taking\ninto account the thermal properties of PET56. Our results show that Fast_2.9 has higher\nactivities thanFastPETaseat30-50 ℃(Fig.4a,4b) andindifferentpH(SupplementaryFig.9),\nalso outperforming LCCICCG in temperature ranges 30-50℃(Fig. 4b), and thus aligning well\nwith the thermal properties of PET and making overall favourable process economy in\nmesophilictemperatures.\nInverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis of the three enzymes with 12 g/L postconsumer\nPET plastics showed that Fast_2.9 has the lowestInvKm, which could be attributed to the\nsubstrate binding cleft stabilisation by S269T for better substrate binding(Fig.3).LowerInvKm\nmeans lower enzyme usage, lowering costs of enzymaticcatalysis,whereasthelowaffinityof\nLCCICCG, as previously suggested,could potentiallylimititswideindustrial adoption75.Assuch,\nwe showed that as little 0.72 mgenzyme・gPET\n–1ofFast_2.9isneededfor nearly100%conversion\ninto TPA of multiple postconsumer PET (both transparent and coloured opaque products)\nwithin just 48hours,which is28%lessenzymeamountthantheoptimised 1mg enzyme・gPET\n–1for\nLCCICCG 56 and 64% less than the recently reported 2 mgenzyme・gPET\n–1 for TurboPETase14.\nMinimising enzyme usage in this process plays a critical role in enhancing the transformation\nof PET waste into high-value products, thereby contributing to the overall valueenhancement\nof this recycling pathway. High conversion rate from raw PET to TPA rather than MHET is\nneeded to achieve the circular biorecycling and is preferable to be done by a single enzyme.\nHere we showed the potential of Fast_2.9 acting as MHETase76 and achieved 95.9% TPA\ncontent in the total monomers. Similar function has been observed in the variant\nIsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A 77,however theexactcontentvaluewasnotreported. Furthermore,in all\nour experiments except for textile degradation, we used post-consumer PET from\ncustomer-used bottles and containers directly, without any pre-treatments such as heating,\ngrinding 18, acid and base treatments 7879, which underscores the application potential of\nFast_2.9. In this study, secondhand polyester textiles were the only material subjected to\npretreatment. These textiles typically exhibit higher crystallinity and contain more additives\ncompared to food-grade bottles or containers. Initial attempts to directly degrade the raw\ntextile using Fast_2.9 showed limited efficiency (datanotshown).However,byincorporatinga\npretreatment step followed by enzymatic degradation at 50°C, we demonstrated the\neffectiveness of Fast_2.9 in recycling textile waste.

In\nPET enzymatic processing, a higher concentration of TPA is advantageous because an\nadditional hydrolysis step is normally needed to completely convert MHET into TPA either by\nenzymatic 80 or chemical hydrolysis18.

We first investigated the\nimpact of nanoparticlepreparationonPETsubstrate crystallinity 40,crucial for catalyticrates41,\nby employing two methods in the Non-Solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) process\nusing hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)42 and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)43 assolvents(Methods).\nWe found that the PET nanoparticles obtained with TFA (PET-NP-TFA) method showed over\ndouble increased crystallinity as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (from 3.8% to\n10.3%), while the PET-NP prepared with HFIP (PET-NP-HFIP) has had only 10% crystallinity\nincrease (from 3.8% to 4.2%) comparing to the starting material (GoodFellow PET film,\nMethods). FT-IR analysis 44 also confirmed that the PET-NP-TFA has a higher crystalline\nconformation ratio with 52.5% increase of A1340/A1372 ratio and 20.0% decrease of\nA1475/A1457 ratio (1457 and 1373 cm−1 have been associated withthegauche conformation\nof PET, while 1475 and 1340 cm−1 increase in intensity during crystallisation due totrans)\n(Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, we continued with the\nPET-NP-HFIPbyencapsulatingnanoparticlesintowater-in-oil-droplets(Methods).\nWe then encapsulated PET nanoparticles (diameter <500 nm, Supplementary Fig. 4) in\nwater-in-oil droplets as a substrate together with IsPETase library to enable subsequent\nhigh-throughput PETase activity screening (Fig. 2a). Single cells from IsPETase random\nmutagenesis library (~2 x 106 clones) were encapsulated with PET NP within water-in-oil\nemulsions46 (Fig. 2b top). After 48 hours of droplets cultivation off chip, we observed cells\ngrown together with PET-NP substrate exhibiting green fluorescence compared to negative\ncontrol (Fig. 2b). We then de-emulsified the droplets and subsequently sorted cells using a\nfluorescent cell sorter. Initially, 77.1% of the cells were selected basedonsizeand complexity\ncriteria to exclude oversized or abnormal cells (Fig. 2c).

Figure 2a was created using BioRender.com.\nIn total 192 variants were sorted out onto the LB agar and, of which 167 (86.9%) grew\nsuccessfully on the sorting plate. Of these, 34 (20.3%) displayed greater catalytic efficiency\nthan wildtype (Fig. 2e). We selected the top 12 of these 34 variants for sequencing\n(Supplementary Table 2) and further analysis. These 12 variantswerepurifiedandretestedto\nconfirmthattheir increased activitywasdue tohigher catalyticefficiencyandnotmerelydueto\nelevated expression or secretion. Out of these, 6 variants showed significantly enhanced\ncatalytic activities, with variant M2.9 (S269T) displaying the highestactivityresultingin 22fold\nincrease over WTIsPETase variant (Fig. 2f). Variants M2.3 and M2.8, exhibited enhanced\nactivity compared to the wild type in the supernatant assay. Yet, when purified, their activities\nwere below that of theIsPETase wild type, likely due to the expression efficiency changes\ncausedbythemutations 35,36,47–49.\nTo evaluate the catalyticefficiencyofM2.9webenchmarkeditagainstFastPETase 18,whichis\nknown for its high efficiency among all IsPETase variants. 200 nM of FastPETase,IsPETase\nand M2.9 were mixed with 19.2 g/L PET nanoparticles at 30, 40, 50 and 60℃for 48 h (Fig.\n2g). M2.9 showed the highest activity at 30 and 40°C, producing 29.0±0.526mMand22.7±\n1.23 mM monomers, respectively. This represented increases of 20% and 13% over\nFastPETase, and 54% and 130% overIsPETase. A decrease in catalyticefficiencyfrom30to\n60°C was noted for all enzymes, withIsPETase and M2.9 displayingfaster declinesat50 and\n60°C compared to FastPETase, indicating that M2.9 is better suitedfor mesophilicconditions.\nAdditionally, we tested M2.9’s activity on PET film from non-pretreated lids of postconsumer\nyoghurt containers (Supplementary Table 4).

All other reagents and buffer 275 \ncomponents were acquired from Fisher Scientific or Merck, unless stated otherwise. 276 \nPhylogenetic and sequence analysis: Protein sequences of reported PETases were aligned using 277 \nClustalOmega35 with default settings. A phylogenetic tree was built from the sequence alignment using IQtree36 278 \nwith 100,000 UltraFast bootstraps37, nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) search, automatic model selection38, 279 \nand 100,000 cycles of single branch testing (SH-aLRT)39.

The structure was deposited in the PDB with code 9EWR. 325 \nData and refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 4.  326 \nStructural characterisation by circular dichroism: Spectra were collected on a PiStar-180 (Applied 327 \nPhotophysics) with water bath temperature control. Protein samples were analysed at a concentration of 0.1 328 \nmg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 with 20 mM sodium chloride at 50 °C, in a 1 mm stoppered quartz 329 \ncuvette. Data collected at wavelengths between 200 and 260 nm, with half bandwidth of 1.5 nm and a 330 \nwavelength interval of 0.5 nm (1 sec per point, 5 repeats), were averaged and baseline subtracted using a 331 \nmatched buffer blank. Raw ellipticity data was converted to mean residue ellipticity by dividing by the path 332 \nlength, concentration, molecular weight and number of residues.  333 \nAmorphous PET powder production and analysis: Sheets of amorphous PET film were cut into strips, 334 \nimmersed in liquid nitrogen and cryo-milled at 2,400 rpm in a SM300 cutting mill (Retsch), with a bottom sieve 335 \nwith 4 mm square holes. Subsequently, this product was reduced in size further by immersing in liquid nitrogen 336 \nand cryo-milling at 18,000 rpm in a ZM200 centrifugal mill, with a 0.12 mm ring sieve with trapezoidal holes. The 337 \nparticle size and crystallinity of the cryo-milled amorphous PET powder was compared to that of the purchased 338 \nsemi-crystalline PET powder, as well as the PET film, using a CAMSIZER X2 (Microtrac MRB) and Differential 339 \nScanning Calorimetry (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figures 13 and 15).  340 \nReaction quenching and product quantification by HPLC: All reactions were quenched by addition of 341 \nequal volume of HPLC-grade methanol, and PET solids removed. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g, using 342 \na table-top centrifuge, prior to analyte quantification by HPLC. For samples with subsequent polymer analysis, 343 \nthe PET was washed by rinsing three times with a 1% (w/v) SDS solution, followed by multiple rinses with 344 \ndistilled water. The partially digested polymer substrates were then dried at room temperature under vacuum 345 \nbefore analysis. The HPLC analysis was adapted from a reported UPLC method14 to allow for HPLC pressures as 346 \npreviously described50. Samples were evaluated on a pre-equilibrated C18 Kinetex LC column (00B-4605-AN) 347 \nwith a guard, at 1.1 mL min-1 with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the stationary and mobile phases 348 \nrespectively. Samples were prepared with a known dilution to an absorbance at 240 nm of around 1.0 before 10 349 \nL were loaded onto the column using an automatic sampler (Agilent). Samples were eluted with an isocratic 350 \nelution at 13% mobile phase for 0.87 minutes, followed by a step to 95% mobile phase for 1.12 minutes and a 351 \nre-equilibration at 13% mobile phase until a total time of 3.6 minutes. Peaks were integrated using Agilent’s 352 \nOpenLab software and the product quantification was performed against calibration curves of known standards 353 \n(TPA, MHET, BHET). An example of the HPLC trace and elution times is provided in Supplementary Figure 16. 354 \nPET degradation assays at small scale: Unless stated otherwise, small scale assays were set up in 1.5 mL 355 \ntubes with 11 mg of PET substrate, and incubated in triplicate 500 L reactions for 24 hours at 300 rpm on 356 \nthermomixers. A final concentration of 100 nM enzyme and 100 mM sodium chloride was used, in 50 mM sodium 357 \nphosphate pH 7.5, or 50 mM glycine pH 9.0 for SfCut and SfInv respectively. In the case of the ionic strength 358 \ntests 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 50 mM CHES pH 9.0 were used instead, with varying amounts of sodium 359 \nchloride, magnesium chloride and sodium sulphate. These buffers were chosen in order to minimise their 360 \ncontribution towards the ionic strength. Nevertheless, the buffer component was fully accounted for in the ionic 361 \nstrength calculations by considering their pKas, and calculating the concentration and charges of their respective 362 \nionic species. The ionic strength of the solution was calculated by using the formula 𝐼 =   ½  𝑛 ∑ (𝐶𝑖 𝑍𝑖 )𝑖 , where 𝐼 363 \nrepresents the ionic strength, 𝑛 is the number of ions in solution, 𝐶𝑖  is the concentration of a specific ion in moles 364 \nper litre, and 𝑍𝑖  the valence of the particular ion species. For the temperature and pH optima experiments, the 365 \nreactions were performed at three temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C) and using three different buffers (50 366 \nmM MES pH 6.0, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, and 50 mM glycine pH 9.0) with 100 mM sodium chloride. To 367 \ndetermine the concentration dependency for each of the enzymes, both were tested individually, and together at 368 \nequimolar ratios, to a final enzyme concentration ranging from 0 - 1 M.  369 \nBinding isotherms: Binding affinities to the plastic were measure in two ways as described previously28. All 370 \nsamples were incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C with rolling in low-binding 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) 371 \nto prevent loss from non-specific binding. After centrifugation, free enzyme concentrations were determined 372 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Substrate saturation: Amorphous PET powder at a fixed substrate loading (100 g/L for 376 \nSfCut or 50 g/L for SfInv) was incubated with 0.05 - 1.5 M enzyme.

Reactions were carried 385 \nout at 20% (w/v) solids loading and a final enzyme concentration of 1 mg of enzyme per gram of PET. Reactions 386 \nwere incubated at 50 °C, stirring at 200 rpm for 24 hours. Substrates used in the reactions were amorphous PET 387 \nfilm or washed and dried post-consumer plastic film waste, roughly cut into 1 cm x 1 cm squares. All pH probes 388 \nwere calibrated immediately prior to analysis, pH changes were followed and maintained by the automatic 389 \naddition of 1 M (SfCut) or 5 M (SfInv) freshly prepared sodium hydroxide via the system pump, which was 390 \ncalibrated prior to the experiment. The base addition was followed as a function of time by the Lucullus® Process 391 \nInformation Management System software and converted to percentage hydrolysis by calculating the moles of 392 \nTPA neutralised. At the end of the incubation, samples were taken and quenched as described previously using 393 \nan equal volume of methanol for HPLC analysis.

Approximately 10 mg of samples was heated from 25 to 300 °C at a 397 \nrate of 10 °C per minute in a nitrogen atmosphere. Measurements were performed in triplicate, and sample 398 \ncrystallinity was calculated using the equation % 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 =  \n∆𝐇𝐦−∆𝐇𝐜\n∆𝐇𝐦° , where ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting 399 \nof the sample ΔHc is the enthalpy of crystallisation of the sample and ΔHm° is the enthalpy of melting for a 400 \ntheoretical 100 % crystalline sample (taken as 140.1 Jg-1). 401 \nPET degradation assays for investigating synergy: To quantitate synergy across enzyme concentrations 402 \nand ratios, amorphous PET coupons were incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium 403 \nchloride, for 24 hours, with various enzyme ratios and concentrations ranging from 0 – 200 nM, as per Figure 5. 404 \nTo investigate whether the synergy was caused by opposite charge effects between the enzymes, size exclusion 405 \nchromatography was performed with 1 mg of total enzyme (~ 34 M) on its own or at equimolar ratio using a 406 \nSuperdex 75 equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, and 100 mM sodium chloride. For the stepwise 407 \nsynergy studies, a final concentration of 100 nM enzyme was used. Films were pre-treated with the selected 408 \nenzyme for 24 hours, reactions quenched and the coupons washed and dried as described above.

Like other reported PETases, SfCut (PDB: 7QJP) adopts a typical alpha-beta hydrolase 57 \nfold, with a conserved disulfide bond between Cys243 and Cys260. The active site matches that of a typical PET-58 \ndegrading serine hydrolase, composed of a catalytic triad (Ser132, Asp178 and His210), a conserved tryptophan 59 \n(Trp157), an oxyanion hole (Phe64 and Met133) and a lipase box. Despite these features, SfCut is strikingly 60 \ndifferent to other highly active PETases owing to its negative surface charge and total charge density of -0.55 61 \nper kDa at neutral pH. These charges are mostly found on the surface opposite to the active site, away from 62 \nresidues expected to directly interact with the plastic (Figure 2a/c). This pronounced charge appears to modulate 63 \nthe morphological selectivity of SfCut, causing its activity to drop considerably between pH 6.0 and pH 7.5 on 64 \nfilms while it increases on amorphous powders4. As PET has a stable, negative zeta potential independent of pH 65 \nat these conditions22, the changes in depolymerisation rates implicate the involvement of both protein and 66 \npolymer electrostatics as significant factors in these properties. 67 \nWe aimed to investigate how protein charge influences substrate morphology preference of SfCut by extensively 68 \nredesigning its surface. To ensure clarity in our analysis, we sought to isolate the effects of charge substitutions 69 \nfrom inadvertent changes to enzyme activity caused by variations in protein thermostability. To avoid this, we 70 \nselected a manual design approach over computational methods, as the later have been constructed in a way 71 \nthat produces stabilised proteins as outputs. For design purposes, all charged residues in the crystallographic 72 \nstructure, including histidines involved in salt bridges, were identified and counted towards the overall protein 73 \ncharge (-16). Owing to the lack of observed crystallographic density, we did not count the first and last glutamic 74 \nacid residues in the sequence. 75 \nTo minimise disruption of the protein-polymer interface and the active site, only residues at a distance greater 76 \nthan 10 Å from the catalytic triad were considered for mutation. For the purposes of design, we ranked residues 77 \nbased on how amenable to change they might be, excluding those that were buried, involved in critical polar 78 \ncontacts, stabilising secondary structural elements, or providing an ambiguous structural role. Our choices of 79 \nsites for mutation were supported by referencing the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of SfCut 80 \n(Supplementary Spreadsheet 1) excluding residues at highly conserved sites. As a priority for mutation, we 81 \nfocused on changing isolated negatively charged residues on Sf Cut’s surface, considering structural context to 82 \nminimise steric clashes and preserve native contacts. Once all the free residues amenable to change were 83 \nexhausted, we proceeded to consider mutations within larger salt-bridge clusters followed by neutral surface 84 \nresidues. In the interest of investigating solely the effect of the surface charge, we did not intentionally introduce 85 \nmutations that could create new stabilising interactions.  86"}

SfInv efficiently digested 181 \nover 10% of the waste within 24 hours, achieving a measured yield of 19.25 g/L, while SfCut yielded negligible 182 \namounts of product (Figure 4b). This further highlights that it may be possible to engineer enzymes specifically 183 \ntargeting the processing of complex post-consumer waste streams of PET with limited pre-treatments, upstream 184 \nof current methods reliant on resource-intensive preparation of micronized powders.29 185 \nSfCut and SfInv act synergistically in degrading aPET films 186 \nBuilding on the evident enhancement in activity and change in selectivity of SfInv over SfCut on PET substrates, 187 \nwe sought to understand whether the enzymes act at distinct sites on the PET surfaces with differing geometries 188 \nor electrostatic charge, which could account for the observed differences in morphological preferences and allow 189 \nfor the enzymes to work synergistically in degrading PET. Specifically, we hypothesised that the amount of 190 \nproduct released from a mixture of the two enzymes could exceed the sum of the product release for each 191 \nenzyme individually at its respective concentration. To quantify this, we define synergy as:  192 \n(1)     𝑆𝑦𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 ≡\n𝑃𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑥\n𝑃𝑅𝑆𝑓𝐶𝑢𝑡+𝑃𝑅𝑆𝑓𝐼𝑛𝑣\n> 1 193 \nwhere PRSfCut, PRSfInv, and PRmix are the product released by each enzyme at specified concentrations, and their 194 \nmixture, respectively. When SfCut and SfInv were mixed at different concentrations and ratios, and applied to 195 \nPET films, we observed clear evidence of synergistic activity (Figure 5a). The effect is most notable at lower 196 \nconcentrations of SfInv, with a synergy value above 2 (Figure 5c). However, at elevated concentrations of SfInv, 197 \nthe synergistic benefit is lost, possibly owing to surface crowding17,20 or competition for binding sites on the 198 \nplastic substrate. In contrast, increasing SfCut does not eliminate the observed synergy, suggesting that each 199 \nenzyme plays a distinct role when acting in concert on the film surface.  200 \nTo further clarify the mechanism of the synergistic activity, we explored potential causes involving the differing 201 \nenzyme charges. One possibility was that the enzymes might assemble in solution in a way that enhances their 202 \nstability and activity. To test this, we incubated the enzymes together at elevated concentrations (~ 34 M, 203 \ncompared to the 0.05-1 M enzyme concentrations used in polymer digestions) and evaluated whether they form 204 \ncomplexes by size exclusion chromatography on the mixture (Figure 5e); no shift was observed in the elution 205 \nprofile, suggesting that the enzymes do not appreciably bind to each other in solution. To exclude the possibility 206 \nthat the enzymes are targeting different sites on the polymer chain and therefore modifying the plastic surface 207 \nsuch that it becomes a better substrate for the oppositely charged enzyme, we examined whether the enzymes 208 \nshowed a stepwise synergy. The activities of the enzymes were evaluated on amorphous PET film coupons that 209 \nhad been pre-treated with either SfCut or SfInv (Figure 5d), with no significant difference in activity observed on 210 \nfilms pre-treated with either enzyme, showing that the surface targets for both enzymes are largely the same.  211 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Similar effects have been previously 215 \nobserved with the use of synthetic surfactants30, where anionic detergents were used to increase the negative 216 \nsurface charge of the polymer, therefore attracting the cationic IsPETase31 to the surface, accelerating enzymatic 217 \ndegradation.

Through carefully crafted studies on the effects of ionic strength 237 \non product released from different substrates, we demonstrate that substrate selectivity is driven by polymer 238 \nmorphologies having distinct electrostatic profiles, and therefore influencing enzyme-surface interactions in 239 \ncontrasting manners. Measured zeta potentials are known to have smaller magnitudes on rough surfaces than on 240 \nsmooth surfaces33,34, and the impacts of this are likely manifesting here. Within the diffuse layer around the 241 \nneatively charged polymer surface, the anionic SfCut experiences repulsion while the cationic SfInv experiences 242 \nattraction, with these interactions being more pronounced on smooth films than on rough powders. 243 \nBy focusing on electrostatic interactions governing the activity of PET degrading enzymes at the polymer surface, 244 \nwe demonstrated that it is possible to not only tune the selectivity of PETases for substrates of differing 245 \nmorphologies, but also increase their binding affinity through the rational engineering of surface charge away 246 \nfrom the active site. The process of introducing large scale changes in protein surface electrostatic potential in 247 \nSfInv also afforded substantially improved activities on all PET substrates tested, exposing the benefits of using 248 \nan electrostatically-oriented approach to engineering plastic depolymerases for improved activities at the low salt 249 \nconcentrations relevant for industrial processes. As we demonstrate through the preservation of the 250 \nthermodynamic stability of SfInv, this approach is complementary to established methods designed to enhance 251 \nthe thermostability of enzymes and can be introduced in the engineering process towards better industrial PET 252 \ndepolymerases. 253 \nWe also found that synergistic activity between PETases can be realised through the applications of 254 \ncomplementarily charged proteins. While the enhancement in activity we observed on films is relatively modest, 255 \njust over two-fold, this advance is the first method for building synergy into enzymes acting at plastic surfaces 256 \nand opens the door to engineering campaigns specifically tailored towards improving it. In contrast to synergies 257 \nbetween enzyme pairs acting at different chemical sites on a substrate, the mechanism of synergy in this case 258 \nappears to depend upon the electrostatic masking effect of the positively charged SfInv when bound to PET, 259 \nwhich in turn promotes the activity of the negatively charged SfCut. This mechanism is likely generalisable and 260 \nopens the possibility of exploiting this discovery to reduce the enzyme loading needed for industrial processes or 261 \nto create dynamic mixtures of enzymes capable of accommodating variations in surface electrostatics across 262 \nsubstrates or over the course of depolymerisations.  263 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Therefore, it can be concluded that gradual erosion from 270 \nthe surface is the major mode by which Fast-PETase attacks the PET film; however, erosion inside 271 \nthe film sometimes occurs at a later stage of the reaction.  272 \nMoreover, one side of the film surface became rougher than the other as the reaction 273 \nprogressed (Figure 4A–4D).

Before degradation, the 293 \nsurface was flat and smooth, whereas after 4 h of degradation, many depressions having a 294 \ndiameter of 1 μm were apparent. Given that areas of undegraded surface were found close to these 295 \ndepressions, the depressions were structures generated by Fast-PETase in the initial phase. The 296 \nsurface of this depression was not as rough as that of the PET degraded for 12 h, as shown below.  297 \nAt 12 h of degradation, the depressions formed at 4 h were not observed, and the surface 298 \nappeared flat at a lower magnification (Figure 5D). However, hollows with a diameter of 2‒4 μm 299 \nappeared, and the surface appeared sandy at a higher magnification due to the granularity of many 300 \nsmaller pores with a diameter of 10‒100 nm (indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 5E and 5F). 301 \nThis hollow structure was also found less frequently at 4 h of degradation and is thus considered 302 \na characteristic feature that appears after the initial depressions (Figure 5A–5C) disappear.  303 \nAfter 26.5 h, the surface became highly rough even at a lower magnification due to the 304 \nlarger diameter (10 μm or more) of the holes (Figure 5G).

SAXS analysis 332 \n Although scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a powerful tool for visualizing the 333 \nfine structure of degraded PET, it only provides a local view of the structure. Therefore, it is 334 \nnecessary to consider whether the SEM observations truly reflect the structure as a whole. SAXS 335 \nwas used to visualize the mesoscale structure of the degraded PET film in an averaged view. Two 336 \nnotable observations were made.  337 \nFirstly, the scattering intensity around q = 0.022 Å -1, observed before degradation, 338 \ndecreased quickly (in the first 12 h) after treatment with Fast-PETase (Figure 6A), indicating that 339 \nthe structure represented by this scattering feature was selectively attacked and removed by Fast-340 \nPETase. Furthermore, this signal shifted to lower q, accompanied by a decrease in the intensity 341 \nduring the early stages of degradation, as shown in the Lorentz-factor-corrected plot (Figure 6A, 342 \ninset). Given the equation d = 2π/ q, where d indicates the spatial periodicity, the size of the 343 \nstructural component represented by this scattering changed from ca. 290 to 320 Å. Although 344 \ncareful discussion is required for describing the structure represented by this scattering signal, it 345 \nmay represent a randomly distributed denser region in a less dense region, which has been 346 \nproposed as a “nodule” in some previous studies [25, 26].  347 \n The second specific structural change induced by Fast-PETase was observed as an 348 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Given the synchronicity with the appearance of small pores in the SEM images 350 \n(diameter of 10‒100 nm), this may represent the small pores observed in the SEM images after 351 \ndegradation for 12 h and beyond (Figure 5), where the contrast between the PET substrate and air 352 \nbecomes more pronounced due to the boring. The scattering in this low q-region increased 353 \ncontinuously after 12 h of degradation, and finally the scattering profile at 68.8 h followed a power 354 \nlaw with an exponent of −3.2 in the observed q-range (Figure 6B, black line), which provides the 355 \nsurface fractal dimension of 2.8 (= 6 – 3.2), indicating that the pores with diameters of 10 -7‒10-8 356 \nm formed a three-dimensionally rough surface rather than a smooth surface. This is also consistent 357 \nwith the SEM observations, which showed that the nested porous structures with dimensions of 358 \n10-7 m or smaller became dominant after 12 h degradation.  359 \n 360 \n 361 \nFigure 6.

Summarizing these observations, the surface 374 \nlayer of the amorphous PET film might be slightly more crystalline than the core region and 375 \ncontains the domain (nodule) structure with a size of around 300 Å. This surface layer did not 376 \nallow PETase to bore smaller holes (~100 nm) and yielded less porous features, as observed in 377 \nthe SEM images.

These previous observations of cellulose degradation are in contrast 393 \nto the structural decay of the PET film by Fast-PETase observed in this study (Figures 2, 5, and 394 \n6). This is plausibly due to the structural differences in PET and cellulose due to differences in 395 \nthe assembly of the polymer molecules, as explained below.  396 \nNative cellulosic material is generally a woven textile of crystalline cellulose 397 \nmicrofibrils with a lateral size of 10-9‒10-8 m, whereas the PET film is a continuous mass in which 398 \nmany chains are entangled without a well-defined elementary structural unit, such as the 399 \nmicrofibrils in cellulose. It is assumed that each cellulose microfibril is degraded independently 400 \nby cellulase, and the structural features appear to be maintained on average. However, structural 401 \ndegradation of the PET film by Fast-PETase may preferentially occur close to the surface, as 402 \nrevealed by the specific decrease in the SAXS signal at approximately q = 0.022 Å -1 at the 403 \nbeginning of degradation, which is not observed for cellulose. Therefore, the polymer structure 404 \ngoverns the enzymatic degradability. In other words, the design of the polymer structure is as 405 \nimportant as enzyme engineering for realizing eco-friendly PET or plastic materials in general.  406 \nThe relationship between the polymer structure and enzymatic degradation of cellulose 407 \nhas aided in understanding the structure of cellulose and the function of cellulase. For example, 408 \nthe unidirectional degradation of native cellulose microfibrils by cellobiohydrolase was used to 409 \ndemonstrate parallel chain packing in native cellulose microfibrils [29]. In contrast, parallel-chain 410 \npacking in native cellulose allowed the processive action of cellobiohydrolases to be clearly 411 \nunderstood [30-32]. Such interrelated research is also required for PET and PETase to deepen our 412 \nunderstanding of the mechanism of decay of the PET structure by PETase. Thus, studying PETase 413 \nfrom the viewpoint of the PET structure will be a highly valuable strategy for studying not only 414 \nPETase but also PET, where many issues remain obscure despite the long history of research [16-415 \n18].  416 \nGiven that cellulase is a good example of the efficient degradation of polymer solids, it 417 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The fusion of the 418 \ncarbohydrate-binding module (CBM) to PETase, which is also found in nature [33], has been 419 \nshown to enhance the PET-degrading activity [34-37]. In addition to implementing the absorption 420 \nfunction by CBM, the synergistic effect of mixing enzymes with different modes of action, such 421 \nas exotype cellulases (cellobiohydrolases) and endoglucanases, is a promising strategy [23]. To 422 \nthis end, the mode of action of many PETase proteins must be clarified to design a high-423 \nperformance PETase cocktail. A cellulase-wise strategy is a promising way to develop higher-424 \nperformance PETases. This approach is set apart from state-of-the-art technologies, such as 425 \nprotein engineering with bioinformatics. Polymer structure analysis during enzymatic degradation 426 \nis important for the sustainable utilization of plastic materials and for the research and 427 \ndevelopment of biodegradable plastics.  428 \n 429 \n4. Conclusion 430 \nThe multiscale structural analysis in this study revealed that Fast-PETase gradually 431 \neroded the PET film from the surface and bored many pores with diameters of 10-5 to 10-8 m. The 432 \ndomain structure with dimensions of 10-8 m on the surface of the film was preferentially removed 433 \nat earlier reaction times. However, the crystallinity of PET did not change after degradation. In 434 \nsummary, it was demonstrated that Fast-PETase evenly erodes the amorphous PET film from the 435 \nsurface.

The array of these plastic pollutants, \nof different sizes and types is also mind- boggling. While the load of plastic pollution keeps \nincreasing, driven by global demand and eventual production, means and methods of plastic \nrecycling are few and far in between and ineffective on a broader perspective. The staggering range \nof the burden is often disturbing. The yearly production of plastic waste has been projected to \nreach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050, according to the study done by World Bank [3]. \nIn an effort to limit the load of plastic pollutants, degradation of plastics using microbial sources \nhas been the subject of study over the past few decades. The polymerization of plastic is effected \nby means of weak forces like van der Waals interactions, electrostatic forces as well as hydrogen \nbonds. etc. Microbes are known to degrade plastics in a sequential manner. Broadly, this can be \nsimplified as physical or chemical deterioration, followed by breakdown of polymers which are \nthen shipped to the cytoplasm of the microbes for metabolic breakdown [3].  \nOne of the biggest sources of the pollution and perhaps the most commonly used of plastics is \nPolyethylene Terephthalate (PET). Microbial biodegradation of PET has been mooted for long and \na few breakthroughs have been achieved over the years. Enzymes from  Thermobifida fusca were \nreported from the early years of this century to be effective in the degradation of PET\n[4]. Lipases \nfrom Candida antarctica [4] and cutinases from Humicola insolens  [5] have also been known to \ndisplay PET degradation, and some of these have been shown to have synergistic effects in \nelevating the efficacy and reducing the time of the degradation process [6].  \nIdeonella sakaiensis, a plastic-degrading bacterium, was first discovered in 2016 [7]. I. sakaiensis \nis a Gram negative, aerobic, rod -shaped bacterium belonging to the genus Ideonella and family \nComamonadaceae [8]. Originally isolated from a sediment sample taken outside of a plastic bottle \nrecycling facility in Sakai, the bacterium also uses PET as a sole carbon and energy source for \ngrowth. The PETase enzyme found in the bacteria aids in the degradation of the ester bond of PET. \nIsPETase (PETase from I. sakaiensis) has demonstrated the highest plastic degradation activity \ncompared to all other bacterial enzymes despite the fact that similar enzymes have been discovered \nin a number of other organisms.  \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The PETase enzymes showed the presence of a conserved, PET-binding active \nsite. Ser (160), Asp (206) and His (237) form a highly conserved catalytic triad that aids in the \nstable binding with PET. Several mutations were introduced into the PETase enzyme of Ideonella \nsakaiensis, and wild- type bacteria were used for comparison.  [6] has also reported that mutant \nIsPETase R280A is 22.4% more effective than the wild type. According to the report, these \nvariants were more effective at higher temperatures and their plastic degradation rate was \nsignificantly higher compared to the wild type, but they are not effectively utilised for refuse \ndegradation [10]. However, wild-type bacteria have certain limitations that prevent large -scale \napplication. IsPETase in its natural state is exceedingly unstable and therefore, IsPETase have also \nbeen modified to degrade PET completely at higher temperatures [11]. \nThe mechanism and high- resolution crystal structure of IsPETase [12]  showed that the enzyme \nhas a hydrophobic cavity that binds to PET polymers and breaks the PET into monomers like bis(2-\nhydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) 13. IsPETase \nthough is incapable of hydrolyzing MHET to terephthalic  acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). \nVery recently, [14] reported that PETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus has comparable binding \naffinity for PET and hydrolysis activity at moderate temperatures. With very few substitutions in \nthe conserved domain, RgPETase was found to be  remarkably similar to IsPETase. These are \nthough, the only two instances of discovery of PET degrading bacteria till date. \nThe discovery of plastic degradation abilities in prokaryotic species is a slow process, and \ndiscoveries are few and far in between. With the knowledge of the available enzymes and the \ncouple of structures that have been solved, we therefore strived to predict the presence of such \nplastic degradation abilities in other bacterial species. The search was manifold, both at the level \nof the sequences and the conservation of the degradation domain. The hits were subjected to in \nsilico verification using structural parameters and docking tools. In this investigation, BHET was \nchosen as the substrate both due to its structural similarity to the nucleus of PET and it’s ability to \nhydrolyze into TPA and EG monomers. The predicted structures and the enzymes shed light on \nthe variety of plastic degradation domains from across the prokaryotes, and also demonstrate th e \nrange of alternatives that could be explored in addition to I. sakaiensis for plastic degradation  \nmediated by bacteria. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The simulation employed the Charmm36 \nforcefield. The protein topology file was constructed using the Gromacs software, whereas the \nligand topology file was prepared using the CGenFF server [26]. For solvating the complex, the \nTIP3P water model was used in a 1 nm -sized dodecahedron box. To counterbalance the overall \ncharge of the protein-ligand complex, an adequate amount of sodium (Na+) or chloride (Cl-) ions \nwere added. The system's energy minimisation was performed using the steepest descent algorithm \nfor 50,000 iterations to resolve steric clashes. \nThe C -rescale and V -rescale coupling approach was used for equilibration in NVT and NPT \nensemble simulations respectively, with positional restrains imposed on the protein and ligand to \npreserve its structural integrity  during the equilibration phase . The structural coordinates of the \nsystem were saved for every 10 ps by GROMACS. Generated MD trajectories were analysed in \norder to calculate root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and \nto conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The conformational stability, fluctuating \nresidues, and compactness of the protein and the protein- BHET complexes were validated using \nthe gmx rms, gmx rmsf, gmx gyrate modules of GROMACS, respectively. The Molecular \nMechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) approach was utilised to determine the \nrelative binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes.

Some of these (11) were mutants of IsPETase which had been generated for functional \ncharacterization, and were excluded from the search results. Similarly, 56 mutants of PETase from \nI. sakaiensis were filtered to remove any redundancies. Of the remaining hits, the best matches \nwere selected – a process which yielded 27 sequences across various prokaryotic genomes, having \nsimilarity to IsPETase. All the 27  sequences which were selected showed the presence of the \nconserved serine hydrolase motif (GWSXG), which has been reported to be necessary for the \nbinding of MHET to the active site of IsPETase. ConSurfDB displayed multiple highly conserved \nareas which were highlighted using a colour-coded approach, with the hydrolase domain classified \namong the highly conserved sections ( supplementary figures S4 and S5). The presence of the \ncysteines nearabout the active site for secondary disulphide bond formation, which has also been \nimplicated for PETase activity, is evident among all these 27 sequences. \nThe 27 sequences thus obtained were checked for their sources and revealed the presence of these \nsequences across Rhizobacter sp., Acidovorax sp., Ketobacter sp., Piscinibacter sp., etc. The \nsource species for the 27 have been listed in supplementary table 1.

The lowest similarity which was considered \nwas the sequence from Halopseudomonas pertucinogena with a sequence identity of 51.32% and \n98% sequence coverage. Apart from the conserved serine hydrolase motif and the cysteine, the \npresence of a conserved methionine near the serine hydrolase motif was also a hallmark of the 27 \nsequences (supplementary figure S6). \nFurther, the sequence alignment revealed that all the sequences belonged to the type II category of \nPETases, except Proteobacteria bac terium. T ype II PETases are typically characterized by  \nadditional disulphide linkages due to the conserved cysteine residues at positions 203 and 239. \nType II PETases are more efficient in their plastic degradation abilities compared to type I PETases \ndue to the additional disulphide bonds and certain substitutions in the subsite 2 (supplementary \nfigure S6) [6]. \nDomain identification using MotifScan with the Pfam dataset revealed the presence of the esterase \ndomain acetyl xylene esterase (AXE) across all the 27 sequences. The AXE domain was identified \nat position 123 to 155 in I. sakaiensis exhibiting an E value of 0.00049 and belonging to the \npfam_FS family. The Pfam FS is a database of complete sequences, encompassing the full \ndiversity of proteins, to reveal maximum identification. The AXE domain, identified by Pfam FS, \nis typified by a Ser at position 160, a Met at 161 and four consecutive Gly residues after the M161 \n(supplementary figure S7 and S8) and this was used for all further analyses. \nIn the analysis of 27 hits, the amino acid composition inside the domain exhibited alterations at \n31% (283 out of 918) of the assessed sites, with substitutions being the primary alteration. \nDeletions were noted (supplementary table 2) in merely 1.5% (14 out of 918), whereas additions \nwere negligible (2 out of 918). \nThe Protein Interactome: \nThe PPI network as created by the STRING database revealed a handful of proteins that are part \nof the IsPETase network. Some of these proteins have been implicated in critical processes in the \nassociated pathway of plastic degradation.

Chlorogenate esterase (MHETase) interacts \nwith both s ubsites 1 and 2 for the subsequent degradation of MHET [ 7, 30]. In the absence of \nMHETase, PET is transformed into MHET, TPA, and EG but no further degradation of MHET \nhappens. TPA and EG serve as more readily useable carbon sources, but MHET necessitates \nadditional degradation to be transformed into TPA and EG. The other proteins involved in the \nnetwork are basic functional proteins like topoisomerase s or serine kinases with one membrane \nprotein also finding its place. \nSimilarities in Structures of Predicted PETases: \nGiven the recent discovery of PETase, not many structures were available and it was difficult to \ndetermine the structures from defined templates. To confirm the similarities in the sequence and \nthe domains, the hits were modelled against the template of th e complete structure of IsPETase. \nThe structure of RgPETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus. was available from the PDB with the \nid. 7DZT. The homology models for the rest of the 26 hits were obtained using the Maestro module \nof Schrödinger and validated using ERRAT and Verify3D. Assessing the stereochemical \nproperties using PROCHECK, the Ramachandran Plot for the modelled structures (from \nPROCHECK) also verified (supplementary table 3)  the structural integrities (more than 94% in \nallowed regions for all entries except two where 90% were in allowed regions). \nThe structures were visualized in PyMOL and superimposed with the template structure (6ILW) \nto reveal striking similarities in their overall architecture, as shown in figure 1. The similarities in \nthe predicted structures were also checked using GraSR [29] to verify the visual output from \nPyMOL. GraSR  constructs a graph based on inter -residue distances derived from the tertiary \nstructure. The output is generated based on the predictions from a deep graph neural network. The \nobtained T\nM value represents the similarity of the structure on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the \nmost similar. For our predicted structures, the TM for all the models were above 0.9, with the closest \nbeing the structure from Acidovorax delafieldii. This was indicative of strong structural similarity \nof the predicted structures with that of IsPETase.

While the best \ndocking score obtained, as mentioned earlier, was - 5.5 kcal/mol, some of the structures showed \neither low docking scores or had unacceptable values of RMSD. Of the 27 structures considered \n(including RgPETase), 15 structures showed binding affinity within -4.5 kcal/mol with acceptable \nRMSD values. Of these 15, 8 had docking scores very close to IsPETase, and 5 of these had \nidentical docking pockets. (figures 2 and 3, table 2).  \nHpPETase, HbPETase, and KsPETase belong to the type II class of PETases, exhibiting specific \nsubstitutions in the AXE domain and in subsite 1 and subsite 2, which influence the substrate \nbinding position. The binding pockets of type II  PETases exhibit modest variations and thereby, \nthe binding conformation of the ligand differs from that of IsPETase, which is a type IIb class of \nPETase.  \nThe serine, which was earlier mentioned as one of the conserved residues in the AXE domain, was \nexpectedly present almost all the complexes formed, as either the donor or acceptor in the \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Similarly, the presence of a tyrosine at position 87  \nof subsite 1 is deemed to favour an interaction between the aromatic group of the BHET and the \nPETase [30]. Among the predicted PETases, there is an equivalent distribution of tyrosine and \nphenylalanine at this position, which seems to be favourably interacting with the BHET as well. \nHpPETase, HbPETase and KsPETase showed the presence of a phenylalanine at th is position. \nTraditionally, the nitrogen atoms of Y87  and M161 have been known to be involved in the \nformation of the oxyanion hole, found in type II PETases. In the case of HpPETase, HbPETase \nand KsPETase, the nitrogen from the phenylalanine and the methionine contribute to the oxyanion \nhole which stabilizes the negatively charged oxyanion intermediate during PET hydrolysis . The \nW185 in the subsite 1, however, is a residue which has been conserved across all the five PETases. \nSimilarly, the isoleucine at 208, a part of subsite 1, has been found to be conserved in HpPETase \nand HbPETase, but has been replaced by a valine (hydrophobic) in RgPETase and KsPETase . \nGoing by the activity of RgPETase, the substitution has minimal effect on the  surface \nhydrophobicity. \nIn the subsite 2,  W159 and N241 are highly conserved across all the PETases and has been found \nto be crucial  for the enzymatic function , while A89 is replaced by a serine in RgPETase, \nHpPETase, HbPETase and KsPETase. Despite the substitution, there has been no reduction in the \nhydrolase activity of RgPETase when compared to IsPETase [14]. The threonine at position 88 is \nhowever a determinant in the classification of type II PETases into subcategories a and b. While \nT88 is highly conserved in type IIb PETases [6], substitutions of threonine to valine or leucine has \nbeen noted in type IIa PETases. The presence of a T88L mutation in RgPETase and T88V in \nKsPETase, HpPETase, and HbPETase , are indicative of their classification as type IIa  PETases \n[6]. Similarly, Ser 238 is substituted by phenylalanine in RgPETase and Ks PETase, but in \nHpPETase and HbPETase, it is substituted by a tyrosine, which further point to their type IIa \ncategorisation. All these substitutions have significantly improved the binding of substrate, with  \nHpPETase showing four times higher binding free energy, while KsPETase show ed two times \nhigher binding free energy when compared with the IsPETase. When compared with RgPETase \n(also a type IIa PETase ), all three candidates have substitutions in subsite II and show better \nbinding free energy. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The docking poses chosen for \nthe MD were therefore based on the correctness of the orientation and not the mechanical choice \nof the topmost poses (table 2). \nThe binding free energy of protein- ligand complexes was calculated using MMPBSA to assess \ntheir stability and binding affinity. The cumulative binding free energies for the five prospective \nPETase-BHET (IsPETase -BHET, RgPETase -BHET, HpPETase -BHET, HbPETase -BHET, and \nKsPETase-BHET) complexes were - 2.75 ± 3.41, -0.59 ± 3.45, -12.16 ± 3.02, -1.98 ± 3.93, and -\n6.14 ± 3.14 kcal/mol, respectively, as presented in table 3. The PETase from Halopseudomonas \npertucinogena has the most robust binding relative to the other PETases in the list, having nearly \nfour-fold binding affinity than IsPETase, whereas, the PETase derived from Ketobacter sp. \nexhibits twice the binding affinity in comparison to IsPETase. PETase from Halopseudomonas \nbauzanensis exhibits somewhat lower binding free energy than IsPETase, while RgPETase had \nthe lowest binding affinity for BHET. \nTable 2: Docking score, Lower Bond (L.B.)

In order to mitigate the potential for poor connections and \ngeometry inside the structure, energy minimization was conducted prior to conducting the \nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  \nAmong all the PETase enzymes, HpPETase was found to be the most resilient on interaction with \nBHET (even better than IsPETase), with the RMSD values stabilizing around 0.4 nm throughout \nthe simulation, after an initial inflection (figure 5c) . In case of the IsPETase-BHET complex, the \naverage root mean square deviation (RMSD) values remained consistently below 0.5 nm for the \nwhole simulation. The HbPETase -BHET complex exhibited the third highest stability, with an \naverage RMSD value of 0.6 nm. The KsPETase performed better than the RgPETase  in it’s \ninteractions with BHET – the RMSD stabilizing around 0.8 nm in due course, albeit with \nintermediate flexions. The RgPETase, which has now been experimentally proven to degrade PET,  \nstabilized at around a RMSD value of 1 nm. Overall, the dynamics for all the 5 PETases suggested \nthat the structures of the proteins remained intact during the simulation (figure 5). In each RMSD \nplot, the darker lines highlight the RMSD during the protein-ligand interaction against the RMSD \nof the protein backbone (in faded lines). \n  \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The \nRMSF values consistently stayed below 0.3 for all the PETases, with occasional peaks above 0.3 \n(+0.1) (figure 6). In all the figures, the curve for RMSF of the specific PETase has been contrasted \nwith the curve for IsPETase (shown in the background in grey). For the reported PETases of I. \nsakaiensis and R. gummiphilus, the RMSF values were identical and lower  in comparison to the \nother PETases. Alignment of the sequences of the PETases with the RMSF data revealed that the \nfluctuations were greater in the regions of the proteins having flexible loops, as compared to the \nmore structured regions (supplementary table 5). The N terminal residues which show increased \nflexibility are predictably the ones with greater exposure to the solvent. The peaks of significant \nintensity visible in the RMSF plot of HbPETase, KsPETase, and HpPETase (figure 6b, 6c and 6d) \nare indicative of the presence of significantly more flexible regions of the protein segment at \nmultiple places in these enzymes . The substitution and addition events observed in the sequence \nalignment have an impact on the peak heights observed in RMSF. Though the loop regions display \nincreased variability in these PETases, this has however not impacted the ligand binding, as none \nof the residues from these regions contributed to the ligand binding cavity. The residues \ncomprising the binding site of all the proteins exhibited a high degree of stability and fluctuations, \nif any were of relatively insi gnificant magnitude.

The radius of gyration of the five PETases were also within permissible range \nshowing acceptable stability and maintenance of conformational compaction during the simulation \n(figure 8). However, the radius of gyration showed more fluctuations in the KsPETase (figure 8e), \nindicating a higher order of flexibility. \n  \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The \nsubsequent discovery of R. gummiphilus stirred the interest even more, and the past few years have \nseen renewed vigour in the quest for a naturally occurring solution to the ever-increasing threat of \nplastic pollution in the environment. The work in this manuscript would supplant and provide a \nheadstart to these efforts as it reveals a handful of prospective bacterial candidates which could be \ntapped to harness their plastic degradation abilities.  \nAll of the species shortlisted for this work have shown the presence of a conserved hydrolysis \ndomain, and some of them have been documented to hydrolyze PET and other polymers. \nSubstitution in the catalytic triad has been demonstrated to diminish enzyme activity, and sequence \nalignment confirms that the catalytic triad residues are 100% conserved across all enzymes.  \nBesides the typified Ser 160, Asp 206 and His 237 catalytic triad , the presence of a conserved \nMet161 in the vicinity has also been revealed as a major contributor to binding targets.  All the \nthree candidates have substitutions akin to the t ype IIa category of PETases, further bolstered by \nthe two conserved cysteine residues at positions 203 and 239 for the formation of an extra \ndisulphide bond (unlike type I PETases). \nThe spectrum of variation in the source of these bacterial candidates is also diverse and includes \nspecies residing in environments ranging from the marine to sub- zero habitats. Ketobacter \nalkanivorans [31], Marinobacter daqiaonensis [32], and Gammaproteobacteria bacterium [33] \nwere identified from marine sources and possess conserved hydrolase domains that may aid in the \nbreakdown of microplastics in the ocean, a major issue that plagues the environment and mankind. \nOn the other hand, Oleispira antarctica is another bacterium that could be instrumental in plastic \ndegradation at lower temperatures[34]. A.delafieldii is a common Gram negative aerobe which had \npreviously exhibited high degradation activity against Poly(tetramethylene succinate) -co-\n(tetramethylene adipate) (PBSA) [35] are commonly found in soil, water and on plants but are \nseldom implicated in human infections Interestingly, Schlegelella brevitalea  has been identified \nas a triple mutant of Ideonella sakaiensis , although its hydrolysis activity may not be as efficient \nas that of I. sakaiensis  [36].

The MD studies of the five PETases from \nvarious species revealed significant potential in HpPETase, HbPETase, and KsPETase for plastic \ndegradation, comparable to the experimentally validated IsPETase and RgPETase. The binding of \nBHET to HpPETase , infact, showed better binding energies than the reference IsPETase and \nRgPETase, signifying improved substrate affinity. The values of the MMPBSA calculations  in \nconjunction with its RMSD plot, illustrate enhanced structural stability over time for HpPETase -\nBHET binding, when contrasted with both IsPETase and RgPETase. The same could also be \nhypothesized for the HbPETase and the KsPETase too, arguably to a lesser extent though. The \nconformational stability of the PETases during the simulation using the PCA  analysis again \nrevealed stable structural conformations for the HpPETase, comparable to IsPETase. Interestingly, \nthe PETase from R. gummiphilus (one of the validated PETases) displayed a rather diffusive \ntrajectory during the dynamics, suggesting a flexible conformation during binding interactions, \nwhich may be attributed to the presence of variable region 1 (VR1, Q26- S51), the wobbling \ntryptophan-containing loop (WW-loop, W183-S187), variable region 2 (VR2, P207-V228) and the \nC-terminal region (G271-Y292) in the structure of this PETase. Furthermore, the outputs of Free \nEnergy Landscape (FEL) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) consistently demonstrated that these \npotential PETases preserve structural integrity and compactness during the simulation duration.  \nThe PETase from H. pe rtucinogena and to some extent, H. bauzanensis can be therefore, subjected \nto experimental analysis of their plastic degradation activity. Indeed, a structure for the PETase \nfrom H. bauzanensis have been now deposited, but the reports of its activity still remains elusive. \nThe prospective PETase from Ketobacter sp. however, does not show as much promise as the other \ntwo, but in some aspects, resembles the binding interactions of R. gummiphilus and hence, can also \nbe tried for PET degradation. Although the results obtained in the current study suggest the PET \ndegradation activities of these three alone, the rest of the PETases could also be a source of plastic \ndegradation enzymes, with suitable protein engineering processes to increase their activity.

In\n2016, a PET-assimilating bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was isolated from a PET\nrecycling facility. This bacterium secretes a cutinase-like enzyme, IsPETase, that degrades\nPET to mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate (TPA), and ethy-\nlene glycol at ambient temperature. 2 Since then, eﬀorts have been devoted to engineering\nthis enzyme, resulting in numerous improved variants. 3–13\nThe catalytic mechanisms of serine hydrolases, including PETase, have been extensively\nstudied. Conﬂicting hypotheses have been proposed with particular disagreement regarding\nproton transfer events during the catalytic cycle. 14–18 While QM/MM studies have provided\nvaluable insights, these methods have inherent limitations, such as boundary issues and lim-\nited accuracy in the MM component, and therefore introduce artifacts and produce diﬀerent\nresults.19–26 Additionally, QM/MM simulations often require a large QM region for converged\nresults, which is computationally expensive. 27\nMachine learning force ﬁelds (MLFFs) provide a promising alternative by mapping chem-\nical descriptors to the quantum mechanical energy of systems, 28 combining the eﬃciency of\nclassical force ﬁelds with the accuracy of QM methods. As deep learning (DL) 29 transforms\ncomputational chemistry, several DL-based MLFFs have been developed for MD simula-\ntions.30–33 Previously, we developed QuantaMind, 34 a DL-based MLFF trained on diverse\nbiomolecular fragments with an emphasis on transition-state geometries, shown to be eﬀec-\ntive in simulating reactions in aqueous solutions.\nIn this work, we demonstrate the application of QuantaMind in simulating the complete\ncatalytic cycle of PETase. Our simulations elucidate key proton transfer events that are\nconsistent with previous QM/MM studies. We estimate free energy barriers of 22 and 20\nkcal/mol for the acylation and deacylation steps, respectively, along the lower bound path.\n2\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The large error bars primarily stem\nfrom the relatively short simulation time, necessitating longer simulations for QuantaMind to\nsample suﬃcient conﬁgurations and converge the mean force. Additionally, in the acylation\nstep, the nucleophilic attack and C-O bond cleavage may proceed in a concerted rather than\nsequential fashion. 19 Thus, a two-dimensional distance scan is required to construct the full\npotential energy surface and determine the lowest energy path. A similar approach applies\nto the deacylation reaction’s two sub-steps.\nFinally, as a DL-based model, QuantaMind relies heavily on its training data. While\nthe training of QuantaMind signiﬁcantly considers transition-state geometries, 34 additional\ntraining data would be beneﬁcial, particularly for estimating energy barriers.

Looking\nforward, we envision that this MLFF-based methodology will not only complement but\nultimately supersede traditional QM/MM approaches, eliminating the need for artiﬁcial\nsystem partitioning while retaining quantum-level accuracy at accessible computational cost.\nWith continued reﬁnement, QuantaMind MD has the potential to establish a new paradigm\nfor studying enzymatic catalysis and biomolecular reactivity."}

To retain desired aldehyde products for eventual upcycling reactions, we 93 \nexpressed MaCAR in the previously engineered E. coli RARE.Δ16 strain designed for TPAL 94 \nretention37. We supplemented TPA, MHET, as well as mono-substituted carboxylates FBA (the 95 \nsingle reduction product of TPA) and 4 -hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA, a potential over-96 \nreduction product), to cells expressing MaCAR at a starting pH of 7.5  under aerobic culturing 97 \nconditions. To ensure that all potential intermediates are collected in the supernatant, we performed 98 \na methanol -based extraction of all collected samples. We observed full conversion of MHET, 99 \nFBA, and HMBA to their respective aldehydes after 4 h, indicating these substrates are readily 100 \nimported by cells (Fig. 2B). However, we observed no conversion of the dicarboxylic acid TPA, 101 \nconsistent with this step being a bottleneck. Interestingly, we did observe the full conversion of 102 \nTPA after 24 h, suggesting a delayed uptake relative to monocarboxylic acids. Given that others 103 \nhave briefly observed that pH can play a role in TPA uptake11, we monitored culture pH alongside 104 \nTPA conversion as a function of time. We found that pH decreases correlated to TPA conversion 105 \n(Fig. 2C), suggesting a simple explanation for the delay. To collect further supporting evidence, 106 \nwe saw that buffering the culture media abrogated TPA conversion (Fig. S1), and that lowering 107 \ninitial culture pH accelerated TPA uptake and conversion (Fig. 2D).  108 \nTo more extensively study how pH affects TPA and MHET import, we transitioned from 109 \ngrowing cells to resting cells , allowing for a more controlled reaction . However, we found that 110 \nresting cells of the engineered RARE.Δ16 host rapidly oxidized TPAL, which is a phenomenon 111 \nnot present in growing cells  and could counteract carboxylate reduction  (Fig. 2E-F). To negate 112 \nthis, we further engineered the RARE.Δ16  to include knockouts of 6 aldehyde dehydrogenases 113 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

We 114 \nfound that the ROAR.Δ22 host increased TPAL (4.2-fold) and MHET -ald ( 3.7-fold) 115 \nconcentrations compared to RARE.Δ16 after 4 h (Fig. 2G, Fig. S2). The strain exhibited negligible 116 \nfitness difference nor sensitivity of aldehyde retention in various reaction media (pH and glucose 117 \nconcentration) (Fig. S2-5). We resuspended resting cells of ROAR.Δ22 that expressed MaCAR 118 \nwith TPA or MHET at starting pH  ranging from 4.8 -7.5 in increments of 0.2  (Fig. 2H). As 119 \nexpected, TPA conversion increased as we lowered pH, until TPA precipitated out of solution at 120 \npH 5.0 and 4.8  (Fig. 2I). We could only  observe TPA conversion at pH 6.2 or lower , with a 121 \nmaximum conversion of 92% at pH 5.2, indicating that TPA uptake can occur in acidic pHs. The 122 \nobserved TPA uptake  correlates well with the predicted  formation of the partially deprotonated 123 \nTPA, highlighting the possibility that the mono -protonated form of TPA is accepted by native 124 \ntransporters (Fig. S6). Excitingly, we observed the full conversion of MHET towards MHET -ald 125 \nat all pH tested (Fig. 2J), and we sought to investigate the design of new transformation routes 126 \nthat would exploit this finding. 127 \nScreening of “ETase” activity to enhance cellular uptake of PET deconstruction products 128 \nBecause these experiments showed that MHET uptake was fast and unaffected by reaction 129 \npH, we hypothesized that intracellular expression  of selective esterases (here designated as 130 \n“ETases” for potential activity on PET, BHET, MHET, and/or MHET-ald) could facilitate 131 \ncomplete ester hydrolysis after uptake (Fig. 3A). We desired an ETase that had activity on BHET, 132 \nMHET and MHET-ald at 30°C for intracellular TPA production with limited membrane leakage 133 \nthat could lead to TPA production extracellularly 39,40. We screened 10 previously engineered 134 \nETases on BHET, MHET and MHET-ald.  We selected five engineered variants of the Ideonella 135 \nsakaiensis PETase (FAST41, HOT42, Dura43, Themo-Stable: denoted here as Thermo44 and TS45) 136 \ntwo leaf-branch compost cutinase variants  (LCC39, LCC-ICCG: denoted here as ICCG 46), two 137 \nvariants of bacterium HR29  PETase (BhrPETase47 and Turbo48) and one metagenome-derived 138 \nPETase (PES-H1:denoted here as PES49). While many of these enzymes were primarily studied at 139 \nelevated temperatures for PET deconstruction, we sought to measure ETase activity under ambient 140 \nconditions (Table S1). 141 \nWe expressed each ETase initially in RARE.Δ16 in growing cells to track cell viability and 142 \nto test activity on supplemented BHET, MHET and MHET-ald.

Analysis of the ETase activity allowed us to characterize several BHET-146 \nselective ETases, such as  FAST, PES and D URA, which had high BHET conversion and low 147 \nMHET conversion. We also observed several generalist ETases such as BHR, Turbo, LCC, ICCG, 148 \nand HOT, with high conversion of both BHET and MHET. Surprisingly, we noticed that our entire 149 \nlibrary of ETases had activity on MHET-ald (Fig. 3D-E), and obtained higher conversion s on 150 \nMHET-ald than MHET  (Fig. S7-8). After profiling ETase specificity , we noticed a subset of 151 \nETases has substantial effects to overexpression (BHR, Turbo, ICCG and PES) with others having 152 \nminor effects (Thermo, TS, LCC, Dura, HOT and FAST) (Fig. 3F). Considering both activity and 153 \ntoxicity, FAST showed promise for further applications. 154 \nCoupling ETase and CAR to explore the enhanced uptake of BHET and MHET  155 \nAfter identification of viable ETases, we reasoned that by expressing FAST and MaCAR 156 \ntogether in one-pot we could produce TPAL from BHET and MHET at neutral pH in growing cells 157 \n(Fig. 3G). We compared expression of FAST and MaCAR in separate cells (Cell A and Cell B , 158 \nrespectively) as against expression in the same cell (Cell C) . We hypothesized that expression of 159 \nFAST and MaCAR in the same cell could directly result in TPAL, potentially fully circumventing 160 \nTPA accumulation. First, we showed that supplemented TPA is not consumed under well-buffered 161 \nconditions (Fig. 3H). We then tested if supplying MHET or BHET would yield TPAL. Excitingly, 162 \nwe observed TPAL synthesis in all reaction conditions starting from MHET and BHET, indicating 163 \nboth strategies are viable alternatives to avoid challenges posed by TPA uptake. Using Cell C, we 164 \nobtained high TPAL yields of 82.7% or 98.0% from 5 mM MHET or BHET, respectively (Fig. 165 \n3I-J). Using Cell A and B in co-culture, we found that a 1:1 inoculation ratio resulted in optimum 166 \nTPAL yields of 82.6% and 68.8% from MHET and BHET, respectively. To further highlight our 167 \napproach, we tested both strategies in resting cells with MHET or BHET as our starting substrates. 168 \nWe again saw TPAL production in all our reaction conditions starting from 5 mM MHET or BHET 169 \n(Fig. S9). We observed high TPAL yields of 77% or 88% from MHET or BHET, respectively 170 \nusing Cell C . These results indicate that coupling intercellular TPA  synthesis to downstream 171 \nenzymatic transformations can effectively enable TPA valorization using cells. 172 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To do this, we used a 177 \ntransaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum, which has been shown to accept PET-derived 178 \naldehydes36. Additionally, we co-expressed an alanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis  179 \n(AlaDH) to recycle pyruvate back to the alanine amine donor. We first investigated the operating 180 \npH range of CvTA  in resting whole cells . We noticed that as reaction pH is lowered, para-181 \naminomethyl benzoic acid (pAMBA) accumulates, presumably via endogenous oxidation  (Fig 182 \n4A). We observed that the amination of 5 mM TPAL had an optimal conversion to pXYL at pH 183 \n7.5, resulting in a 90% conversion after 1 h (Fig. 4B). These results highlight a unique challenge 184 \nif we were to start with TPA as an initial substrate as low pH is needed for TPA uptake, but higher 185 \npH is optimal for amination. Despite our progress with alternative PET deconstruction products, 186 \nwe chose to investigate addressing this when starting from TPA by employing a one-pot, two-step 187 \napproach (Fig. 4C) in which the reaction is pH-adjusted from that optimal for TPA to that optimal 188 \nfor CvTA. For this reaction, we supplemented 5 mM TPA at a starting pH of 7.5 or 5.2. For the 189 \npH 5.2 case, after 2 h we increased pH to 7.5 with NaOH. After which, cells expressing CvTA and 190 \nAlaDH (Cell D) were supplemented in both conditions and the reactions were ran for an additional 191 \n2 h. As expected, when starting at a pH of 7.5, we observed no TPA conversion  (Fig. 4D).  192 \nHowever, when starting at a pH of 5.2, we obtained a 97% conversion to the desired  diamine 193 \npXYL (Fig. 4E).  194 \nWhile we achieve d high conversion to pXYL from TPA  using pH adjustment, we next 195 \naimed to produce amines without pH adjustment using MHET or BHET as starting substrates. For 196 \ndirect comparisons of pXYL conversion from TPA to that of our proposed cascade starting from 197 \nMHET or BHET, we continued to run our reactions in a one-pot two-step approach, meaning that 198 \nCell D was added after 2 h. We ran reactions using our Cell C as well as the best performing Cell 199 \nA:B ratio to generate TPAL from MHET and BHET. Using Cells A, B and D, we obtained pXYL 200 \nyields of 80.5% from MHET or 57.4% from BHET (Fig. 4 F, G). With Cell C and D, we observed 201 \nhigh pXYL yields of 93.1% from MHET or 95.9% from BHET. We also examined whether we 202 \ncould selectively  biosynthesize the  antifibrinolytic drug , para-aminomethyl benzoic acid 203 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As MaCAR has been shown to have 204 \nminimal activity on pAMBA, we hypothesized that we could  target pAMBA synthesis using a 205 \none-pot one-step approach36. We found that our t hree-cell approach at a cellular ration of 1:10:2 206 \nof Cells A:B:D resulting in 83% yield pAMBA from 5 mM MHET (Fig. S10).  207 \nReaction scaleup and upcycling of post-consumer PET waste 208 \nGiven that coupling FAST and MaCAR in the same cell showed high  TPAL and pXYL 209 \nyields at 5 mM concentrations of either MHET or BHET, we investigated the ability of  our 210 \nupcycling cascade for either substrate at elevated substrate loading of 10, 20, or 40 mM. We ran 211 \nthese reactions at an increased glucose concentration (80 mM) to ensure sufficient co-factors for 212 \ncarboxylate reduction. For either substrate, we sampled at 4 and 8 h. We observed high yields of 213 \nTPAL in just 4 h with each concentration tested for both supplemented MHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 214 \nmM: 83%; 40 mM: 80%) and BHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 mM: 79%; 40 mM: 79%) (Fig. S11). At 8 215 \nh, we found the yield at 40 mM increased slightly for MHET (84%) and BHET (89%).  216 \nAfter successfully achieving TPAL production at increased substrate loading, we scaled up 217 \nour cascade to a 10 mL reaction volume (from 300 µL) and used intermediate PET deconstruction 218 \nsubstrates from glycolysis of  post-consumer textile or plastic  waste (Fig. 5A). Using previously 219 \nestablished methods, we performed catalytic glycolysis on a 100% polyester red T-shirt resulting 220 \nin mixture of 78% BHET, 21% MHET and 1% TPA 51. We also conducted glycolysis on a post-221 \nconsumer PET plastic bottle that resulted in a mixture of 99% BHET and 1% MHET mixture 52. 222 \nWe next ran our one -pot two -step method to target pXYL production  starting from these  223 \ndeconstruction products. Both solid residues were resuspended in our cellular reaction buffer at an 224 \nestimated 40 mM concentration.  We supplemented Cell C for 8 h and then added Cell D and let 225 \nthe reaction run for an addition 8 h for a total of 16 h. We were excited to see the full conversion 226 \nof deconstruction products in both reactions, with pXYL yields of 89.5% or 90.5% from polyester 227 \ntextile waste or post-consumer PET plastic waste, respectively  (Fig. 5B, C ). As both PET 228 \ndeconstruction and upcycling steps resulted in high yields, our tandem chemical deconstruction 229 \nand biological upcycling strategy resulted in overall pXYL yields of >80%.  230"}

Based on our findings, an entirely cellular alternative could also be designed where 235 \na secreted ETase is chosen for the ability to selectively  produce glycol esters for subsequent 236 \nintracellular processing by a complementary intracellular ETase. Collectively, our results 237 \nshowcase the industrial promise of bypassing TPA as a substrate, harnessing intracellular ETases, 238 \nexploiting extensive strain engineering for TPAL retention, and interfacing engineered bacterial 239 \ncells with catalytic glycolysis for robust hybrid PET valorization. 240 \nThe cellular transport of various PET deconstruction products revealed in this study, if 241 \nsimilar for other bacteria, offers new perspectives on why known natural PET degrading bacteria 242 \nsuch as  Ideonella sakaiensis utilize a two -enzyme (PETase-MHETase) system for PET 243 \nassimilation. Naturally observed PETases tend to generate MHET, which  may leverage aromatic 244 \ncarboxylate transporters for cellular entry that could be widespread across environmental bacteria. 245 \nAs a result, MHETase secretion may not be strictly necessary for natural PET assimilators . 246 \nHowever, based on sequence conservation of the signal peptide on characterized MHETases and 247 \nuncharacterized homologs, we expect MHETase secretion to be the norm. Given that, another 248 \nplausible explanation is  that MHETase secretion accompanied by evolution of a dedicated TPA 249 \ntransporter, while less efficient for the PET assimilator,  may have been an evolutionary solution 250 \nto mitigate the formation of MHET as a common good that other bacteria containing promiscuous 251 \nhydrolases could utilize. 252"}

Results  \nThe exponentially growing pollution of plastics is posing harm to all life forms. The frequently \nused PET plastic accounts for a major portion of the total accumulated plastics on Earth in \ndifferent environmental niches. Bioremediation has been identified as the most effective \napproach to deal with growing plastic levels (Joseph et al., 2024). Numerous PET-degrading \nenzymes have been characterized, and some engineered enzymes have been developed. Though \nmuch research has been conducted, very few effective enzymes for the degradation of \ncrystalline PET plastic have been translated into technology for application in in situ  \nconditions, either due to low efficiency against high crystallinity PET or temperature \nsensitivity, or inhibition from ionic species present in the environmental soil in in situ \nconditions (Samak et al., 2020). In the present study, EstS1 esterase, a thermostable and pH-\ntolerant phthalate diesters-degrading esterase, has been characterized for its potential to degrade \nPET plastic in controlled as well as in situ conditions, thus can be utilized for the development \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

BHET degradation kinetics of EstS1 esterase  \nThe wild-type and Ser154Ala mutant of EstS1 esterase (34 kDa) cloned in the pET28a vector \nwere purified up to 99% purity and concentrated to a concentration of 50 mg/mL (Figure S1). \nHPLC-based steady-state kinetics was performed using different concentrations of BHET to \nanalyze the BHET degradation efficiency of the wild-type EstS1 esterase. The analysis of \nBHET in the presence and absence of EstS1 esterase was done for each considered \nconcentration. The absorbance of BHET was monitored at 240 nm, and a significant peak of \nBHET was obtained at a retention time (t\nR) of 1.67 min (Figure 2). The reduction in the peak \nabsorption in the presence of EstS1 esterase compared to the control was quantified using peak \narea, and thus, the degradation of BHET was estimated (Figure 2). The BHET degradation was \nobserved to increase with the increase in concentration of BHET from 65% to 75%, indicating \nthe first-order zone of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which encourages the most accurate \nestimation of k\ncat/Km. The k cat/Km value estimated for BHET degradation was 13.63 M -1 sec-1, \nand the Vmax and Km values were obtained to be  209.48 µM/min and 17.09 mM, respectively.   \n \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The absorbance at 240 nm showed a reduction in reaction (which \ncorresponds to BHET concentration) as compared to the standard (control). \n2.2. Identification of BHET degradation products \nAn LC-MS-based analysis was performed to further analyze the degradation of BHET by EstS1 \nesterase. The products of BHET degradation, i.e., MHET and ethylene glycol, along with TPA, \nwere detected at retention times (t\nR) 8.12 min, 7.16 min, and 1.66 min, respectively, in negative \nion mode (Figure 3 A, B, and C). Similar studies have reported the identification of the BHET \nproducts in negative ion modes, while BHET was identified in positive ion mode (\nŚ widerek et \nal., 2023) (Figure S2). The detection of TPA as a degradation product revealed the ability of \nEstS1 to catalyze the conversion of BHET to MHET and MHET to TPA, thus mediating \ncleavage of both the ester bond present in BHET (De Queiros Eugenio et al ., 2021). The \nintensity versus mass/charge (m/z) ratio spectra of MHET, TPA, and ethylene glycol depict \nsignificant intensity peaks at the m/z values of 209.05, 165.02, and 62.96, which are close to \nthe molecular masses of MHET (209.17 g/mol), TPA (164.11 g/mol), and ethylene glycol \n(62.07 g/mol) further confirming the presence of these compounds (Aristizábal-Lanza et al., \n2022) (Figure 3 D, E, and F).        \n \nFigure 3:  Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the bis(2-\nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) degradation by EstS1 esterase.

Complex crystal structures of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET \nThe co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET was solved in space group P63 at 2.2 Å \nwith one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The refinement quality parameters of R\nwork and Rfree \nwere 19.2% and 24.95% (Table 1). The structure of EstS1 esterase comprised of 304 residues \nof which 12 residues (Glu8, Lys32, Arg70, Arg133, Lys145, Ser164, Arg166, Arg198, Ser231, \nArg262, Glu269, Gln270) were observed in alternate conformation. The electron density map \nof residues Gln13 to Ser23 was missing due to the high flexibility of this loop. The EstS1 \nbelongs to an \nα /β  hydrolase family having a characteristic fold of 8 β -strands with intermittent \n12 α -helices and a β -strand Pro60-Tyr66 running anti-parallel to the other 7 β -strands. The \nresidues Tyr181 to Pro239 form the cap domain over the catalytic site, consisting of Ser154, \nHis278, and Asp248 catalytic triad (Verma et al., 2024).  \nThe co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET revealed the catalytically active form of \nthe enzyme in the crystal, as the difference Fourier map displayed the densities of one molecule \neach of BHET, MHET, and ethylene glycol contoured at 3\nσ  (Figure 4 A and B). The overall \nstructure of EstS1 consists of two surface cavities connecting together to form a tunnel that \ncentres the catalytic site (Figure 4 C). The surface cavity 1, constructed by the cap domain \nheading toward the active site, has been identified in our previous work to mediate the entry of \nthe substrate (Verma et al., 2024). In the present study, one molecule of MHET, the product of \nthe reaction, was observed at the active site, forming hydrogen bonds with the catalytic Ser154, \nthe oxyanion hole residues Ala155, Gly84, Gly83, and a water molecule, depicting the actual \nsecond tetrahedral intermediate of the canonical catalytic mechanism of esterase (Verma et al., \n2024; Long & Cravatt, 2011) (Figure 4 B and C). The O4 atom of MHET formed a hydrogen \nbond with the OG atom of Ser154 at a distance of 2.5 Å, while the O5 atom of MHET formed 3 \nhydrogen bonds, with the backbone N of Ala 155 at a distance of 3.3 Å, the oxygen atom of \nwater at 2.7 Å, and the backbone N atom of Gly84 at 3.1 Å, respectively. The water molecule \nfound in the catalytic site in turn, formed a hydrogen bond network with the catalytic serine and \nthe oxyanion hole residues, thereby stabilizing the complex (Figure 4 B). The tail containing \nthe second ester linkage of the formed product MHET was observed to be sandwiched between \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

These two methionine residues contribute to the cap domain, which \nis likely to provide substrate specificity. Two water molecules were also present in the cavity, \nmediating the interaction of the O3 atom of the carbonyl carbon of MHET with the methionine \nresidues (Figure 4 B). The BHET molecule in the catalytic tunnel was observed near cavity 2, \ndue to the presence of hydrophilic residues Thr92, His93, and Thr282 in its close vicinity, the \nresulting orientation placed BHET at a distance from the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole, \nthus preventing its degradation (Figure 4 B and C). Therefore, confirming cavity 1 as an \neffective site for entry of the substrate to mediate the catalysis. \n \nFigure 4:  Crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET and its degradation \nproducts.

The co-crystal structure of \nSer154Ala mutant EstS1 esterase with BHET was solved at 2 Å in P63 space group with R\nwork \nand R free of 17.81% and 22.16% respectively (Table 1). The residues Arg6, Lys32, Thr57, \nIle129, Lys168, Ser222, and Ser231 were found to be present in alternate conformation, and the \nelectron density of the loop comprising Gln13 to Ser23 residues was missing. This complex \nstructure revealed the electron densities of two BHET molecules in the difference Fourier map \ncontoured at 3\nσ  (Figure 5 A). One molecule of BHET was observed at the active site and \nseemed to enter from cavity 1, while the other molecule was in front of the first one and \ntowards cavity 2 (Figure 5 B). The orientation of the BHET molecule bound at the active was \nsimilar to that of the degraded product MHET discussed above and was favourable for \nmediating catalysis but due the presence of alanine (Ala154) in place of catalytic serine \n(Ser154) the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond did not interact with the Ala154 while the \nterminal hydroxyl group O1 atom of the BHET formed hydrogen bonds with backbone \nnitrogen atoms of Gly83, Gly84 and Ala155 at a distance of 2.8, 2.7 and 2.9 Å respectively. \nMoreover, the hydrophilic residues and network of water in the catalytic tunnel towards cavity \n2 resulted in a curved orientation of the second BHET molecule, resulting in its inaccessibility \nto the catalytic site (Figure 5 B and C).  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The \nanalysis of the MD simulation trajectory revealed high stability of the EstS1 esterase when \npresent in complex form as compared to the apo-protein. The RMSD values ranged within a \nnarrow range of 0.20 to 0.30 nm in complex form compared to 0.15 to 0.35 nm for the apo-\nform of the protein, indicating high stability of the complex (Schreiner et al., 2012) (Figure 6 \nA). The least variation in Rg values within 1.81 to 1.85 nm disclosed high compactness of the \nprotein during the simulation trajectory of 1 \nμ s (Filipe & Loura, 2022) (Figure 6 B). The RMSF \nversus residue plots showed a reduction in fluctuation in residues ranging from Tyr181 to \nPro239 in complex form compared to the apo-protein. These residues contribute to the cap \ndomain, which mediates the entry of the substrate. The reduction in fluctuations in the cap \ndomain in complex form discloses that binding of the substrate at the catalytic site imparts \nstability to the cap domain during the simulation (Benson & Daggett, 2012) (Figure 6 C). The \nsolvent accessible surface area analysis during the trajectory time showed variation in the range \nof 127 to 140 nm\n2 in complex form, while the variation in apo-form ranged from 123 to 144 \nnm2, in turn showing reduction in solvent accessible surface area and hence increase in \ncompactness and stability of the protein in complex form (Durham et al., 2009) (Figure 6 D). \nThe variation in secondary structures showed an increase in the alpha-helicity and a significant \ndecrease in the coiled structures in the complex form compared to the apo-form of the enzyme, \nindicating high stability of the complex form (Coskuner-Weber & Caglayan, 2021) (Figure 6 E \nand F). The steepness of the free energy landscape of EstS1-BHET complex revealed \nattainment of global minima or a properly folded low-energy state during the trajectory, as \ncompared to local minima or partially folded states observed in the apo-protein (Maisuradze et \nal., 2010) (Figure 7 A and B). The consistent intermolecular hydrogen bonding between EstS1 \nand BHET showed effective interaction during the trajectory at the active site of the enzyme \n(Bondar & White, 2011) (Figure 7 C). The clustering analysis of the 1 \nμ s trajectory disclosed a \nlarge number of structures in the top 10 clusters (Figure 7 D). The superimposition of the \nrepresentative structures of the top 10 clusters revealed that the BHET was consistently bound \nat the active site, interacting with the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole residues (Phillips et \nal., 2011) (Figure 7 E). Thus, the present analysis provides compelling evidence for the highly \nstable and consistent interaction of BHET at the active site of EstS1 esterase.  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Discussion \nEnzymatic degradation of PET plastic is being intensely investigated to deal with the major \nfraction of accumulated PET plastic in the environment, which is responsible for increasing \nplastic pollution. Diverse PETases, BHETases, cutinases, lipases, and esterases have been \nstudied for their efficiency in degrading different PET varieties, including amorphous PET, \nnanoPET, semi-crystalline PET, and crystalline PET. Several studies have engineered these \nenzymes to enhance their thermostability and efficiency to a greater extent (Bell et al., 2022; \nCui et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; Pfaff et al., 2022).  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The present study elucidates the BHET and PET \ndegrading ability of the EstS1 esterase utilizing biochemical, structural, in silico , and SEM \nanalysis-based approach. Around 75% degradation of BHET by EstS1 esterase was observed \nover a period of 1 h, resulting in the formation of MHET and TPA, concluding the ability of \nEstS1 esterase to convert BHET into MHET and then MHET into TPA. Previous study on \nStreptomyces strains characterized the BHET-degrading potential of Streptomyces LipA lipase \nvariants and identified mild TPA formation compared to MHET, with low activity above 40 °C \ndue to the lack of enzyme stability at high temperatures (Verschoor et al ., 2024). EstS1 \nesterase, a highly thermostable esterase, annotated as triacylglycerol lipase, produced a \nsignificant concentration of TPA as compared to the MHET. HtDLH, a thermostable hydrolase \nof Hydrogenobacter thermophilus reported for PET, BHET, and MHET degradation, shows \ncomparable BHET degradation to EstS1 esterase (Almeida et al., 2024). Several other studies \nreported engineered PETase enzymes having high catalytic activity against BHET, while the \ncatalytic efficiencies of wild-type enzymes were comparable to that of EstS1 esterase analyzed \nin the present study (Bell et al., 2022; Pfaff et al., 2022; Numoto et al., 2020; Kitadokoro et al., \n2012; Sulaiman et al., 2011). \nTo illustrate the structural aspects of BHET interaction at the active site of EstS1 esterase, the \nco-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET was determined and revealed not \nonly the presence of the active form of EstS1 esterase in the crystal form, but also the density \nof MHET and ethylene glycol along with BHET. The bound MHET (the product of BHET \ndegradation) at the active site depicted the exact second tetrahedral intermediate conformation \nof the canonical serine hydrolase mechanism. The cap domain, which mediates the substrate \nspecificity, varies in length in different esterase and PETase enzymes (Distaso et al ., 2023). \nThe cap domain of EstS1 of 59 residues forms cavity 1, which mediates the entry of the \nsubstrate. The two methionine (Met186 and Met207) residues of the EstS1 esterase, lying in the \ncap domain, provide a proper orientation to the substrate to interact with the catalytic triad, thus \nmediating catalysis. Similar contributions of the cap domain residues in mediating effective \nsubstrate binding have been reported in previous studies on MHETase (Knott et al., 2020). Joo \net al., 2018, in their structural analysis of IsPETase, reported Met161 and Ile208 as the lead \nresidues providing a hydrophobic surface for substrate binding, similar to the hydrophobic \nresidues Met186 and Met207 present in cavity 1 of the EstS1 esterase (Joo et al., 2018).

The \nlarge cap domain of EstS1, compared to the other PET-degrading enzymes, provides a massive \nscope for further enzyme engineering studies to improve its efficiency (Luan et al., 2016).  \nThe complex structure of the Ser154Ala active site mutant of EstS1 in complex with BHET \nexhibited the presence of two BHET molecules bound in the catalytic tunnel of EstS1, one after \nthe other, demonstrating the significant size of the tunnel to accommodate the PET polymer."}

The free energy landscape of the EstS1-BHET complex showed \nattainment of the stable low-energy state of the enzyme (Benkovic et al., 2008).  \nMoreover, the erosion and indentation of crystalline PET film surface in the presence of the \nenzyme in both controlled conditions and soil system with varying temperature conditions \nconfirmed effective crystalline PET degradation potential, high stability, and ionic tolerance of \nEstS1 esterase. Though several studies have analyzed the PET film degradation using \namorphous PET film, nano PET, and PET microplastics, very few studies have been conducted \nfor the degradation of crystalline PET in conditions mimicking the original environment \n(Wilkes et al., 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024; J. Kim et al ., 2023). The XPS-based surface and \ndepth profiling analysis discovered a higher concentration of nitrogen in the treatment sample \ncompared to the extremely low concentration in the control samples. Also, the formation of -C-\nO-, -C-N-, -C=O-, -C=N-, -N-H-, and -N=O- bonds was observed to increase in the treatment \nsample while the prevalence of these bonds was less in the control samples, thus proving the \ndegradation of the PET film (Doren et al., 1994). Further, the atomic concentration versus \ndepth plot showed a lower proportion of carbon on the surface of the enzyme-treated sample \ncompared to the control sample in turn indicating erosion of the surface. Similar increase in \nnitrogen concentration in enzyme treated PET film have been observed in past studies \nindicating effective degradation and production of nitrogen conjugated products containing -C-\nN-, -C=N-, -N-H- and -N=O- bonds along with increased formation of -C-O-, and -C=O- bonds \nwas reported (Huang et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024)  \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Its efficiency in degrading crystalline PET plastic and its \nmonomer BHET have been evaluated, along with its in-depth structural analysis, displaying the \nmechanism of degradation. Hence, it can be further exploited for enzyme engineering studies to \ndevelop into a high-efficiency PET as well as phthalate diester plasticizer-degrading enzyme, \nproviding a complete solution to the increasing plastic and plasticizer pollution.   \n4. Conclusion \nGlobal plastic pollution has drawn widespread concerns due to its adverse impacts on all life \nforms across the globe. PET-based plastics are leading contributors to the increasing plastic \npollution. Bioremediation of plastics using potential enzymes is a safe, eco-friendly, and \neffective approach. In this piece of work, we have identified the BHET and PET degrading \npotential of a EstS1 phthalate diesters-degrading pH-tolerant and thermostable esterase from \nSulfobacillus acidophilus DSM10332 strain. The kinetic and LC-MS-based analysis disclosed \nup to 75% degradation of BHET, a PET monomer, into MHET and terephthalic acid. Complex \ncrystal structures of wild-type and mutant forms of EstS1 esterase with BHET have \ndemonstrated the mechanistic insights of the enzyme, representing the cap domain residues as \neffective contributors responsible for the proper orientation of the substrate at the active site. \nFurther, the cavity 1 formed by the cap domain was identified as the exact entry site for the \nsubstrate to mediate the reaction. In silico analysis of the EstS1-BHET complex exhibited that \nthe enzyme attains a highly stable, low-energy folded state in the presence of substrate. \nEventually, the variations in elemental composition and chemical bonding via XPS and \ncorroded surface and indents on the surface of crystalline PET film via SEM analysis were \nobserved in incubated PET film with EstS1 esterase, which provided strong evidence for the \nPET degradation potential of EstS1 esterase in constant and varying temperature conditions, \nmimicking the environmental variations. Henceforth, further enzyme engineering of EstS1 \nesterase can provide a highly potent solution to the exponentially growing plastics as well as \nplasticizer pollution to attain the goals of a sustainable environment.   \n5.

The expression was checked by adding isopropyl \nβ -D-thiogalactopyranoside \n(IPTG) as inducer at a concentration of 0.5 mM. The induced culture was shifted to 16 °C for \nincubation for 16 h. The cell mass was obtained and resuspended in 10 mL lysis or purification \nbuffer (100 mM phosphate buffer, 10 % v/v glycerol, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The cells \nwere lysed at 20 psi using a constant cell disruptor, and the lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at \n12000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and transferred to a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA \naffinity column with purification buffer and incubated for 10 min (Mahto et al ., 2022).

The reactions were then filtered through 0.2 \nμ m nylon filters. \nChromatographic separation using reverse phase chromatography was performed using a C18 \nreverse phase column (Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH column) of dimension 1.7 \nμ m, 2.1 mm × \n100 mm. The mobile phase consists of 0.1 % v/v formic acid in methanol and water at a flow \nrate of 0.3 mL/min. The elution gradient was used over 20 min, ranging from 100% water to \n100% methanol (Swamy et al., 2024).  \nMass spectrometry analysis was done using an Xevo G2-XS QTof Quadrupole Time-of-Flight \nMass Spectrometry system (Waters) in both positive and negative ionization modes.

The source and desolvation temperatures were 450 °C and 120 °C, and \nthe gas flow rates of the cone and desolvation were 50 L/h and 900 L/h, respectively. Electron \nspray ionization with a scan range of 100-1000 m/z and 1 s scan time was used. The parameter \nof collision energy for low energy was 6 eV , and for high energy, a ramp from 20 to 30 eV was \nset with a time of acquisition of 8 min. Processing of LC-MS data was done using Waters \nUNIFI software (Waters), and the target by mass approach was utilized. Other parameters, \nincluding the maximum number of targets, fragment match tolerance, target match tolerance, \nand ion ratio tolerance, were specified. Further threshold values from candidates per sample, \nrelative intensity, and peaks per channel were added.

The Principal Component \nAnalysis (PCA) was performed for all the trajectory frames, and the free energy landscapes \nwere generated for both the apo-protein and complex form of the protein (David & Jacobs, \n2013). The clustering analysis to study the effective interactions of BHET with the catalytic \ntunnel of EstS1 was done considering an RMSD cutoff of 0.2, and the representative frames of \nthe top 10 clusters were superimposed to study changes in the structure in complex form and \nthe interaction mechanism of EstS1 with BHET (Abramyan et al., 2016). All plots of the MD \nsimulation analysis were prepared using Origin 2024 software ( https://www.originlab.com/\n), \nand images of representative clusters showing 3D interactions of BHET with EstS1 were \ngenerated using PyMol software (https://www.pymol.org/) (Rigsby & Parker, 2016).  \n5.6. PET film degradation analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging \nThe small pieces of crystalline PET films (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) were soaked in the \npresence of EstS1 esterase (15 μ M) for a duration of 15 days at 25 °C. Control samples without \nprotein using 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 were also prepared. After 15 days, the \nsamples were collected and washed with 70% ethanol and distilled water to remove traces of \nenzyme and buffer. The morphological analysis of films was done for both enzyme-treated and \ncontrol samples using a scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher, Apreo S Low Vac, 2011) \nat 15 kV accelerating voltage. Film samples were gold-coated at 18 mA for 140 s. Digital \nimages were generated using Apreo SEM imaging software (Yan et al ., 2020; Ducoli et al., \n2023).  \n5.7. Analysis of PET film degradation in natural conditions \nThe ionic composition of soil often poses an inhibitory effect on the enzymes present in the \nsoil. To analyze the effect of soil ionic composition on EstS1 PET degradation activity, the PET \nfilm was cut into small pieces of equal weight and incubated in samples containing soil+buffer \n(soil control), and soil+buffer+EstS1 (soil treatment). The soil used for the experiment was \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The clean soil was subjected to autoclaving at 15 psi for 20 min to remove the \npossibility of any other microbe enhancing the degradation. 6 g of autoclaved soil was used in \neach soil sample (treatment and control).15 \nμ M of enzyme concentration was used in the \ntreatment samples of soil, and an equivalent volume of buffer was used in the control sample. \nAll control and treatment samples were kept outside in native environmental conditions in \ncovered small glass bottles to mimic the in situ conditions of temperature (ranging from 40 °C \nin the afternoon to 28 °C at night) and pressure for 15 days (Liu et al., 2023). The degradation \neffect of EstS1 esterase in treatment versus control samples was analyzed using a scanning \nelectron microscope (EVO 18, Carl Zeiss, 2012, and ZEISS SmartSEM software) at 15 kV as \nmentioned above. The PET film samples were washed with 70% ethanol before SEM analysis, \nfollowed by distilled water to remove any traces of soil and enzymes. All experiments were \nperformed in triplicate. This experiment provides scope for the direct in situ application of the \nEstS1 esterase in soil for PET plastic degradation (Y an et al., 2020; Ducoli et al., 2023).  \n5.8. PET film degradation analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis \nTo further analyze the change in surface chemistry due to the degradation of the PET film by \nEstS1 esterase, the surface analysis of the PET film was performed by X-ray photoelectron \nspectroscopy. The PET film (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) samples incubated with EstS1 \nesterase (15 \nμ M) for 15 days, along with control samples incubated with an equivalent volume \nof 100 mM phosphate buffer in natural environmental conditions in small glass bottles, were \nsubjected to XPS analysis. The PET samples were washed with 70% ethanol and twice with \ndistilled water to remove any traces of enzyme and buffer from the samples. The change in \ncarbon, oxygen, and nitrogen elements’ composition, chemical state, and bonding was studied \nup to a depth of 50 nm by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI 5000 Versa Probe III; \nUlvac-Phi, Inc). Ultrahigh vacuum of 2 * 10\n-7 Pa with Al Kα  monochromatic source of energy \n1.48 keV was used. The beam diameter of 100 µm, stage tilt angle of 45°, charge neutralizer \nwith 15 V and 20 µA, and non-conductive tape as substrate were used for the analysis. Survey \nscan spectra were collected with an energy of 280 eV and 0.05 eV energy step. The high-\nresolution spectra of C1s, O1s, and N1s were recorded with 55 eV pass energy and 0.05 eV \nenergy step. The C1s standard at 284.80 eV was considered as a reference. To analyze the \nchemical bonds, the carbon C1s and oxygen O1s region peaks were fitted. The Multipak XPS \nsoftware for deconvolution and data analysis was used (Doren et al., 1994). \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, it \nis important to avoid creating an illusion for the public or \noverestimating its role, as biodegradation in the ecosystem, \neven if possible, cannot match the amount of PET released \ninto the environment. The most crucial aspect is to collect \nand recycle PET waste as much as possible. Enzymatic PET \nhydrolysis is a promising technology for ecofriendly PET \nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404 \n Page 13 of 18 404\nrecycling. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibil-\nity of industrial PET biorecycling using PET hydrolases. \nCurrently, uncountable PET-hydrolyzing enzymes have \nbeen identified, including type I and type II with varia-\ntions. However, none of the wild-type enzymes are suitable \nfor industrial applications. To achieve a practical level for \nindustrial biorecycling, enzymes have been mutationally \nimproved, with PET waste pretreatment. Variants created \nfrom the representative PET hydrolases and their muta-\ntional strategies are listed in Table S4 and S5. Currently, \nno enzyme can meet the requirements for industrialization \nwithout pretreatment of PET waste, such as amorphization \nand micronization. This is because enzyme efficiency highly \ndepends on the ratio of PET dimensions per enzyme, and the \ndegradability of crystalline PET is significantly lower than \namorphous PET. PET waste, including polyolefins, PET, \nand polystyrene, is often discarded as plastic trash without \nbeing sorted by type, except for transparent water bottles, \nwhich are collected and recycled. The classification of PET \nwaste based on its crystallinity grade, whether amorphous or \ncrystalline, is practically impossible. Therefore, biorecycling \nrequires a balance between improving enzymes and imple-\nmenting economical and ecofriendly pretreatments. Some \nenzymes performed better on untreated or crystalline PET \nwaste than  LCCICCG , which is still considered as the standard \nPET hydrolase. However, the degradation of crystalline PET \nwas much lower than amorphous PET, leaving behind unde-\ncomposed remnants, mostly crystalline parts. PET stored at \ntemperatures near Tg undergoes physical aging (Hutchinson \n1995). When post-consumer PET waste was kept at 70 °C, \nits crystallinity gradually increased and reached a threshold \nof 20% for the upper limit of biodegradation in approxi-\nmately 10 h (Pfaff et al. 2022). However, after being kept at \n65 °C for 24 h, there was almost no increase in crystallin-\nity (Tournier et al. 2020). The amorphous fraction of PET \nundergoes physical aging at 70 °C, gradually transforming \ninto rigid amorphous fraction adjacent to the crystalline \nfraction. This transformation results in limited accessibility \nto enzymatic hydrolysis, as noted by Wei et al. (2019a). The \nreaction temperature of  LCCICCG  was re-optimized from 72 \nto 68 °C, possibly due to these risks, as suggested by Arnal \net al. (2023). TurboPETase displayed better performance at \n65 °C than  LCCICCG  (Cui et al. 2024) on a laboratory scale \n(in a 7.5 L bioreactor). The operational temperature for PET \nhydrolases must be lower than 68 °C. On the other hand, a \nnew LCC variant, LCC-A2 suggested the best performance \nat 78 °C in a shorter time than  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase \n(Zheng et al. 2024). Further work is needed to evaluate them \nscientifically and practically. Erickson et al. (2022) used \nbioinformatics and machine learning to identify 74 putative \nthermotolerant PET hydrolases with natural diversity. The \nthree candidate enzymes showed higher hydrolysis rates for \nthe crystalline powder compared to the amorphous powder \nor film. Furthermore, two of the candidates performed better \nfor amorphous films than for amorphous powders. However, \ntheir optimal temperatures range from 30 to 60 °C and their \nactivity levels are lower than those of  LCCICCG  at 70 °C. \nCarbios has announced the industrial use of  LCCICCG  for \nenzymatic recycling (https:// www. carbi os. com/ en/ enzym \natic- recyc ling/). PET hydrolases that can operate at tempera-\ntures lower than 68 °C for shorter than 24 h or PET hydro-\nlases that can degrade crystalline PET to the same extent \nas amorphous PET, achieving 98% conversion at 20% PET \nloading, could replace  LCCICCG . TurboPETase and LCC-\nA2 outperform  LCCICCG  on a laboratory scale, but their \ninvolvement in the industrial biorecycling of PET is yet to \nbe determined, as the industrialization involves several fac-\ntors other than PET hydrolase and requires the total process \nrefinement is needed.\nTaken together, PET hydrolases applicable to industrial \ndepolymerization of PET need enough thermostability close \nto the Tg of PET (below 80 °C) and keep sufficient durability \nand catalytic efficiency of at least 90% (ideally 95%) conver-\nsion against amorphous PET (high loading ~ 200 g/L; pref-\nerably higher).  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase can be the stand-\nard enzymes used for PET biorecycling. It should be noted \nto use  LCCICCG  or TurboPETase under its optimal condi-\ntions (pH 8.0 and 65-68 °C) on testing. In numerous studies, \nthe activity of each target enzyme has been compared to that \nof wild-type LCC (even after the publication of  LCCICCG ) \nor  LCCICCG  at lower temperatures, such as 30−50 °C. No \ninternational scientific consensus has emerged for the evalu-\nation of PET hydrolases (Arnal et al. 2023), which require \ncommercially available or voluntarily provided PET powder \nsamples for testing, as an amorphous film from Goodfellows \nCambridge, Ltd. was used as the standard substrate for PET \nhydrolases in the previous stage of research.\nThe performance of the resultant mutation appears to \ndepend on wild-type enzymes. For example, although ther -\nmostabilized mutants of IsPETase have been developed, \nthey are still unsuitable for industrial use (Arnal et al. 2023; \nCui et al. 2024). This is likely because PET hydrolases have \ncomparable core structures, but differ in their thermosta-\nbility and activity levels, which are determined by their \nunique sequences. Thermostabilized mutants of Is PETase \nhave been modified with the same amino acids found in type \nI enzymes, such as W159H/L117Y/Q119Y (DuraPETase) \nand a disulfide bond (IsPETaseTM N233C/S282C , and Hot-\nPETase), as described above. Positive indexes for improv -\ning type I enzymes include the introduction of an additional \ndisulfide bond at the appropriate position, mostly at the \ncation-binding site, to increase thermostability. Changing \nan obstacle amino acid to probable extension of the poly -\nmer chain was useful. For example, in Cut190, changing \nGln138 to Ala and in LCC, changing Tyr127 to Gly were \neffective. However, in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y, a single mutation \n Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404\n404 Page 14 of 18\nwas attempted by changing Gln94 to Tyr, but it failed. The \nsubstitution of Leu136 to Phe in Cut 190 and Leu93 to Phe \nin PES-H1L92F/Q94Y (LCC has Phe125 at the same position) \nlikely enhanced the interaction between the amino acid and \nthe polymer, resulting in a π-π interaction between Phe and \nthe aromatic ring of TPA. The combination of L92F and \nQ94Y in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y may create an aromatic channel \nalong with an aromatic clamp (Trp155 and Phe62) (Pfaff  \net al. 2022). It has yet to be confirmed whether the rule \nobserved in PES-H1 is applicable to others. However, the \nnew findings with PES-H1 and TurboPETase provide clues \nfor improved performance. PES-H1 has His130 and Leu210 \nin the conserved pair of His and Phe in subsite II of the \ntype I enzyme. Replacement of Leu with Phe reduced the \nactivity, but replacement with Thr improved the activity \n(Richter et al. 2023). BhrPETase shares a 94% identity with \nLCC and has a pair of His and Phe like LCC. However, its \nefficient mutant, TurboPETase, has a pair of His and Thr \n(Cui et al. 2024).  LCCICCG  contains His and Ile residues \ninstead of Phe. Therefore, the conserved amino acids can be \ncarefully mutated. Leu/Ile and Thr may lead to a more flex-\nible binding groove than that in the wild-type. TurboPETse \nchanged the pair of His218 and F189 at subsite I to Ser and \nIle, respectively, which are characteristic of IsPETase. This \nchange is believed to contribute to a more flexible binding \ngroove, along with the Phe243 to Thr mutation at subsite \nII. These changes improve flexibility in subsites I and II, \nwhich is considered the fourth index. The upcoming research \nstage will concentrate on PET hydrolases that can convert \nhigher loadings of PET at lower temperatures, comparable \nto those of  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase (preferably shorter). \nFurthermore, the focus will be on those that work better \non crystalline PET to minimize the PET pretreatment steps. \nArnal et al. (2023) suggested that acid-tolerant PET hydro-\nlases, which can efficiently depolymerize PET with no (or \nminimal) need for soda for pH regulation, would be useful \nin industrial applications.\nThe three most efficient templates for PET hydrolase \n(LCC, PES-H1, and BhrPETase) were identified using a \nmetagenomic approach. This suggests that a metagenome-\nderived enzyme gene is a mixture of multiple genes and is \nconsidered a mutant.\nMüller et al. (2005) discovered the first PET hydro-\nlases approximately 20 years ago. Carbios is constructing \nthe first plant for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET \nin Longlaville, Grand-Est Region, France. The plant is \nexpected to start the first significant deliveries to clients \nusing  LCCICCG  in 2026. From the end of 2026, Hündgen \nEntsorgungs GmbH & Co. KG will supply 15kt/year of \npost-consumer PET flakes to the first commercial plant \n(carbi os. com/ en/ enzym atic- recyc ling/). TurboPETase \n(Cui et al. 2024) and LCC-A2 (Zheng et al. 2024) outper -\nformed  LCCICCG , but the enzyme must overcome barriers \nof practical application for biorecycling. Further improve-\nment of PET hydrolases would be beneficial for future \nPET biorecycling. The knowledge accumulated regarding \nPET hydrolases is also useful for the biorecycling of other \npolymers.\nNow, the main target of biorecycling is transparent \nor colored bottles, which make up around 30% of PET \nproducts and fibers occupy approximately 60 % (Tournier \net al. 2023). Packaging films comprising amorphous PET \noccupy the third volume of all PET products. They are \npotential targets for biorecycling, when they are separated \nfrom other polymer packages such as polyethylene, poly -\npropylene, and polystyrene packages. Polyester fibers are \nmade of semicrystalline PET, which has a higher crys-\ntallinity than bottles. They can be targeted for the biore-\ncycling, using the same technology as that for PET bot-\ntles. However, fibers are often used in mixed forms with \nother natural or synthetic materials, and garments need \nmore complex processes to remove accessories such as \nbuttons and fasteners (natural, synthetic, or metal mate -\nrials). Polymer-recycling is closely linked to social sys-\ntems such as bans, laws, and waste-collection networks, \nthereby not dependent only on technological feasibility. \nHowever, expansion of the target for the biorecycling must \ncontribute to reducing the plastic release into the environ-\nment. Upcycling of degradation products (TPA and eth-\nylene glycol) coupled with biorecycling of PET has been \ntried (Amalia et al. 2024; Satta et al. 2024), but its future \nwould depend on technological development and economi-\ncal profitability.\nPET is unsusceptible to decomposition by UV, unlike \npolyolefins, which are prone to UV-induced decomposi-\ntion and become a constituent component of microplastics. \nNevertheless, PET microplastics occupy approximately half \nof the total microplastic, as they are released in household \nwastewater through polyester fabric laundry (garments, \ncarpets, textiles etc.). Detergents contain various enzymes \n(https:// bioso lutio ns. novoz ymes. com/ en/ dish/ insig hts/ artic \nle/ begin ners- guide- enzym es- deter gents). PET hydrolases \nare expected to prevent pilling on the surface of polyester \nfabrics. They might also offer a solution for removing micro-\nplastics and microfibers generated through laundry as one of \nthe detergent enzymes. This is also an industrial application \nof PET hydrolases. For laundry purpose, PET hydrolases \nmight satisfy new requirements, such as working at moder-\nately high temperatures and accomplishing the high decom-\nposition of pilling and microplastics (far lower concentration \nof PET materials in washings compared to industrial biore-\ncycling). Micro- and nanoplastics have far broader surface \nthan minimized PET particles for industrial biorecycling, \nwhich is beneficial to PET hydrolases. Enzymatic removal of \nmicroplastics and microfibers of PET can be technologically \npossible for municipal wastewater treatment.\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404 \n Page 15 of 18 404"}

To explore the structural\ndifference between wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase, the\ncrystal structures of those two proteins were determined at 2.0 Å\n(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Table 1) and 1.5 Å\n(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1), respectively. We compared the\nstructure of wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase and found\nthat the tertiary structures of these two proteins were quite similar,\nwith an overall RMSD of 0.352 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In the\nstructure of linker-attached PETase, we can only see a part of the linker\n(6 amino acids) in the form of an irregular structure, indicating that the\n(GGGGS)\n2 linker is ﬂexible. This result is consistent with previous\nﬁndings that the GGGGS sequence is the most widely usedﬂexible\nlinker that can appropriately separate the functional domains55.T h e\ncatalytic centers of these two proteins were compared as well. As\nshown in Fig.1d, the two active-site pockets were almost identical. The\nabove results revealed that the C-terminal fused linker did not induce\nobvious structural changes in PETase. To validate our structuralﬁnd-\nings, we also performed molecular dynamics (MD) studies for the\ncodisplayed PETase and HFBI (Fig.1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). In the\nsimulation, the (GGGGS)\n2 linker showed highﬂexibility, and no unique\nstructure was observed when the linker-attached PETase was displayed\nby the yeast cell-wall protein GCW51. Moreover, thisﬂexible linker\nseparated PETase from GCW51 in space, meaning that the two func-\ntional units did not affect each other.\nTheoretically, our codisplay system should perform dual func-\ntions that mimic the two-step process of PET degradation\n23,24.T h eﬁrst\nfunction, which is derived from the HFBI part, is the ability to self-\nassemble and facilitate the binding of yeast cells onto the hydrophobic\nPET surface. The second function, which is inherited from PETase, is to\nenzymatically degrade the highly crystallized substrate PET.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 2\nSupplementary Fig. 3 shows the Western blot (WB) results of both\nPETase and HFBI at different induction times. Positive bands on the WB\nﬁlm indicated that both proteins were successfully expressed in the\nrecombinant yeast. To further demonstrate that HFBI and PETase were\nsuccessfully displayed on the yeast cell surface, an immunolocalization\nassay was performed. Aﬂag tag was introduced to the N-terminus of\nPETase as a response to the detection of anti-ﬂag antibodies. For the\ndisplayed HFBI, a monoclonal antibody against HFBI was used in the\nimmunoﬂuorescence assay. As shown in Fig.1f, strong ﬂuorescent\nsignals of PETase and HFBI were observed on the yeast cell surfaces.\nAdditionally, noﬂuorescent signal was detected inside the cells.

No obvious signals were detected from\nthe protoplast fraction, regardless of the codisplay and display system.\nAll the above results conﬁrmed that both proteins were displayed on\nthe yeast cell surface, as expected. In addition, the intensity ofﬂuor-\nescence was increased with increasing induction time, and the amount\nof surface-displayed HFBI was greater than that of the surface-\ndisplayed PETase when the induction time was less than 96 h\n(Fig. 1g). These results indicated that induction time played an\nimportant role in the levels of PETase and HFBI expression on the cell\nsurface\n34.\nAfter we obtained the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed\nPETase and HFBI, we were eager to know whether the displayed PETase\nmaintained its enzymatic activity when it was codisplayed with\nhydrophobin HFBI. Figure1h shows the degradation products released\nby the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed PETase and HFBI by\nusing hcPET as the substrate. The major product released by the dis-\nplayed PETase was mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET),\nand trace amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-\nTPA (BHET) were detected at the same time. The ratio between the\nliberated products of displayed PETase and that of the native PETase\nwas almost the same (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Together, these results\nindicated that the displayed PETase was biologically active and\nexhibited the same reaction mechanism as that of native PETase,\ncleaving the polymer preferentially at similar positions\n14,56.\nThe turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was calculated by\nquantitatively analyzing the high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) results from Fig.1h. The standard curve of each released pro-\nduct was calculated to accurately measure the amount of each product\n(Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). A semiquantitative WB method was then\nused to estimate how much PETase was displayed in the yeast cells. We\nﬁrst generated a standard curve of wild-type PETase by performing\ngrayscale analysis with the WB results (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).\nSubsequently, yeast cells (at 48 h induction) were subjected to the\nsame WB analysis to detect the displayed PETase (Supplementary\nFig. 6c). According to the standard curve, 151.2 ng of PETase in a total\nof 2 × 10\n7 displayed yeast cells. For the Codisplay system, 2 × 107 cells\ncontained 35.2 ng of displayed PETase. As shown in Fig.1ia n dS u p -\nplementary Fig. 7, the turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was\ndramatically affected by the induction time and the ratio between HFBI\nand PETase that was displayed on the cell surface. The ratio reached a\nmaximum value at the induction time of 48 h when the ratio between\nHFBI and PETase displayed on the cell surface also reached its max-\nimum. The above results revealed that the amount of HFBI on the cell\nsurface exhibited an obvious impact on the enzymatic activity of the\ndisplayed PETase\n57.\nIn our codisplay system, PETase is theoretically responsible for\ndegrading the substrate PET. To conﬁrm that surface-displayed HFBI\ndoes not degrade PET as well, three surface display systems were\nconstructed, including the PETase (S160A)/HFBI codisplay system,\nlinker-GCW51 (removing PETase)/HFBI codisplay system and HFBI\nsingle-display system, which are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a-c.\nEnzymatic analysis of each surface display system revealed that none\nof the displayed systems constructed above exhibited PET degradation\nactivity, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e), suggesting that\nPETase performed an enzymatic function rather than hydrophobin on\nthe surface of yeast cells.\nSurface-displayed HFBI can increase the adsorption of codis-\nplayed cells on PET surfaces by improving their surface\nhydrophobicity\nIn the above study, we conﬁrmed the surface expression of hydro-\nphobin HFBI. Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) and water\ncontact angle (WCA) measurements were performed to verify whe-\nther the displayed HFBI could induce alterations in the surface\nhydrophobicity of the recombinant yeast cells. MATH is a classical\ntechnique for determining the surface hydrophobicity of various\ncells\n58,59. This method involves examining the adhesion of cells to\nliquid hydrocarbons (e.g., n-butanol, p-xylene), as this adhesion is\ndirectly associated with the hydrophobic surface properties of cells\n(Fig. 2a)\n60. As shown in Fig.2b, all yeast cells in the control group\n(without induction) remained in the lower aqueous phase, indicating\nthat the cell surface properties were hydrophilic. As induction time\nincreased, the yeast cells that codisplayed PETase and HFBI gradually\nmoved into the upper oil phase, causing a concomitant loss in tur-\nbidity throughout the lower aqueous phase. The relative hydro-\nphobicity of the cell surface de ﬁned in the Methods section\ncontinued to increase with the induction time and reached a max-\nimum at 96 h (Fig.2c). To further demonstrate that the increase in\ncell surface hydrophobicity was mainly due to the surfaced-displayed\nHFBI, a MATH assay was conducted by using yeast cells that dis-\nplayed only PETase. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows that yeast cells with\nonly PETase remained in the lower aqueous phase within the entire\ninduction time. Together, these results demonstrated that the dis-\nplayed HFBI was responsible for the increase in the codisplayed cell\nhydrophobicity.\nWCA is another commonly used method to measure the surface\nhydrophobicity of tested cells\n61. After performing high-density cell\nmodiﬁcations, the WCA of the hcPETﬁlm can be determined by\nexamining the cell surface properties. As shown in Fig.2d, e, the hcPET\nﬁlm displayed a typical hydrophobic property (WCA is 85°). After\nmodiﬁcations were performed with yeast cells that codisplayed PETase\na n dH F B I( 4 8hi n d u c t i o n ) ,t h eW C Ao ft h eh c P E Tﬁlm slightly changed\nfrom 85° to 73°, indicating the codisplayed yeast cells exhibited a\nhydrophobic surface property. To clarify the contribution of the dis-\nplayed HFBI to the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed yeast cells, the\nWCA of yeast cells displaying only PETase was also determined. The\nhydrophilic property (WCA is 37°) of the PETase-displayed cell con-\nﬁrmed that the HFBI part played an essential role in determining the\ncell surface hydrophobicity. Together, these results veriﬁed that by\nexposing its hydrophobic patch on the protein surface, the displayed\nHFBI can indeed increase the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed\ncells\n43–46.\nTo determine whether the effect of displayed HFBI on cell\nhydrophobicity can be transformed into an effect on the attachment of\nyeast cells on the PET surface, we observed the adsorption of the\nFig. 1 | Protein expression and function ofP. pastorisGS115/PETase-HFBI at\ndifferent induction times. aX-ray crystal structure of the amphiphilic hydro-\nphobin HFBI (the hydrophobic patch is marked in red) and PETase (blue indicates\npositive charge, red indicates negative charge, and the dotted line indicates active\npocket position).b Schematic diagram of the codisplay system.c The overall\nstructure of PETase-linker (the red arrow is marked as Linker).d Catalytic triad\ncomparison of wild-type PETase with PETase-linker.e MD simulations of the\ncodisplay system over 100 ns.

It was quite clear that the binding num-\nbers of the HFBI-displaying yeast cells on the hcPET surface were\napproximately twice that of the control group at each tested condition.\nThe adsorption differences between the codisplay cells and cells dis-\nplaying only PETase on the surface lcPET could also be observed,\nregardless of the concentration of yeast cells in the binding assays\n(Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). The number of HFBI-displaying yeast cells\nadsorbed on the lcPET surface was approximately twice that of the\ncontrol group under each tested condition (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d).\nWe believe that the similar surface hydrophobicity of hcPET and lcPET\nresulted in similar experimental results (Supplementary Fig. 12) by\nWCA. To further verify the role of HFBI in the codisplay system, we\ndesigned a codisplay system in which only hydrophobin was removed\nand the other parts remained unchanged. Supplementary Fig. 13a\nshows that both liker-GCW61 and PETase were successfully displayed\non the surface of yeast cells. Then, we tested the enzymatic degrada-\ntion performance against hcPET and lcPET, and we found that the\ncodisplay system without hydrophobin exhibited a greatly reduced\ndegradation ability toward both hcPET and lcPET compared with that\nof the normal codisplay system (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c). In addi-\ntion, the adsorption capacity of this system on the PET substrate was\nreduced to approximately half of the original value (Supplementary\nFig. 14). These results clearly revealed that the adhesive unit HFBI was\nparticularly important for the codisplay system to exhibit a high\ndegradation capacity to PET. Taken together, all these results con-\nﬁrmed that hydrophobin HFBI displayed on the yeast cell surface\nintroduced the extra binding capacity to the yeast cell on the PET\nsurface.\nThe codisplay system exhibited extraordinary enzymatic activ-\nity against PET\nWe then explored the optimal conditions of the codisplay cells for\nhcPET hydrolysis and compared the results with those of puriﬁed\nPETase. Figure3a and Supplementary Fig. 15a show that temperature\nexhibited an obvious inﬂuence on the turnover rates for both the\ncodisplay cells and native PETase. The codisplay cells exhibited an\nenhanced enzymatic activity compared with that of native PETase at\neach tested temperature condition. The optimal reaction temperature\nwas 40 °C, similar to native PETase, indicating that the codisplay cells\nremained in a heat-labile degradation system\n14. Since high temperature\ncan promote the chain mobility of PET to accelerate its enzymatic\ndegradation, a heat stabilizing unit could be introduced into the cur-\nrent surface display system to further improve its degradation efﬁ-\nciency in the future\n18.F i g u r e3b and Supplementary Fig. 15b shows the\neffect of pH on the turnover rates of the codisplay cells. The maximum\nturnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9, similar to\nnative PETase. At other pH conditions, the codisplay cells exhibited\nmuch higher turnover rates than those of native PETase. For example,\nboth yeast cells displaying only PETase (Supplementary Fig. 16) and\nnative PETase were almost inactive at pH 10. However, the codisplay\ncells maintained more than 50% of their total enzyme activity, indi-\ncating that their alkaline tolerance was signiﬁcantly improved. The\nsurface-displayed HFBI may contribute to this result since HFBI is very\nstable at extreme pH conditions and can even resist protease degra-\ndation in vitro\n44,62–64. The increased tolerance of the codisplay cells to\nalkaline environments can facilitate the PET pretreatment process65.\nWe then explored whether the cell number of codisplay cells\ninﬂuenced their turnover rate. Figure3c shows that the turnover rate\nfor the codisplay cells was at its maximum (2146.5 × 10−5 sec−1)a n d\nremained constant when the protein concentration was less than\n1.3 nM. When the protein concentration exceeded 1.3 nM, the con-\nversion rates decreased rapidly. This result revealed that there the\ndisplayed PETase on the yeast surface might be optimal, which cor-\nresponded to the maximum PET surface-reaching of the displayed\nenzyme molecules. Additional displayed PETase molecules sterically\nhindered the PET surface and appeared inactive, leading to a\ndecrease in the turnover rate of the codisplay cells. The native\nPETase and the display cells faced similar situations as the codisplay\nsystem, and the turnover rate reached maximum values (6.5 × 10\n−5\nand 227.9 × 10−5 sec−1) when the protein concentrations were 370 nM\nand 11.3 nM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16c and Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 17). Finally, we found that the maximum turnover rate of the\ncodisplay cells was strikingly 328.8-fold higher than that of native\nPETase (Fig.3d).\nThen, we performed both SEM and optical microscopy to observe\nthe morphological changes in the codisplay cell-treated hcPETﬁlm. At\nthe same time, we used native PETase-treatedﬁlms as controls. As\nshown in Fig.3e, there was almost no surface erosion on the PETase-\ntreated hcPETﬁlm, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of native\nPETase against hcPET was rather low. In contrast, apparent cracks and\nerosion on the PET surface were observed by SEM when the yeast cells\nthat codisplayed HFBI and PETase were applied to hcPET. Microscopic\nobservation of cross-sections of the PETﬁlms was also performed to\nfurther evaluate the degradation results of our codisplay system. As\nshown in Fig.3f-g and Supplementary Fig. 18, almost no change in the\nthickness of the PETase-treated hcPETﬁlm was observed. A small but\nobvious reduction in thickness (~3.2%) was observed when our codis-\nplayed yeast cells degraded the hcPETﬁlm.\nTo further verify the functionality of the codisplay system, the\nenzymatic activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst toward a commercially\navailable lcPET (PET-GF, crystallinity of 6.3%) was also measured.\nConsidering that the degradation substrate was changed, we opti-\nmized the degradation conditions of both the codisplay cells and\npuriﬁed PETase for lcPET. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 19 and\nSupplementary Fig. 20, several reaction conditions, including tem-\nperature, pH, and cell number, caused obvious effects on the turnover\nrates of the codisplay cells and puriﬁed PETase. The optimal reaction\ntemperature remained at 40 °C (Supplementary Fig. 19a), and the\nmaximum turnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9,\nsimilar to native PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19b). These results were\nsimilar to those obtained by using hcPET as the degradation substrate.\nT h et u r n o v e rr a t ef o rt h ec o d i s p l a yc e l l sr e a c h e di t sm a x i m u m\n(2909.3 × 10\n−2 sec−1) when the normalized PETase concentration was\n0.65 nM. In contrast, the turnover rate of puriﬁed lcPET reached a\nmaximum value (5.6 × 10−2 sec−1) when the protein concentration was\n181.4 nM (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Accordingly, the maximum turn-\nover rate of the codisplay cells against lcPET was 519.5-fold higher than\nthat of the puriﬁed PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19d).\nSupplementary Fig. 21 shows the morphological changes in the\ncodisplay cell-treated lcPETﬁlm, as observed by SEM and optical\nmicroscopy. Obvious erosion spots were observed on the surface of\nlcPET, which is consistent with the results of hcPET degradation,\nindicating that the results were statistically signiﬁcant. In addition, it\ncan be seen from the SEM results that the PETﬁlms degraded by the\ncodisplay system were full of round pits with a size of ~5 microns,\nwhich was basically consistent with the size of yeast cells. These results\nrevealed that yeast cells adsorbed on the PET surface and then exerted\nenzyme activity, as seen in the adsorption experiment (Supplementary\nFig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11). The puriﬁed PETase contained small\ncorrosion spots locally and was very small. This result indicated that\nthe codisplay system could efﬁciently degrade lcPET and hcPET.\nIn addition, we tested the crystallinity of lcPET and hcPET before\nand after degradation at different temperatures using the codisplay\nsystem, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 22. For lcPET, it can be seen\nthat the crystallinity increases with increasing conversion level, indi-\ncating that PETase degraded amorphous PET in the codisplay system.\nHowever, the crystallinity of the PETﬁlm treated with the system\nwithout enzyme at different temperatures did not change obviously\ncompared with that of the control group, indicating that the\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 6\nCodisplay\nPETase\n20 30 40 50\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\na\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n600\n1200\n1800\n2400\n234567 89 1 0\nCodisplay\nPETase\npH\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\nb\nCodisplay\nPETase\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\nProtein concentration (nM)\n61 2 18 1000 2000 3000\n3701.30\n123456\n0\n600\n1200\n1800\n2400\n1.30\nc\ne\nCommercial hcPET\nControl PETase Codisplay\nf\nControl PETase\nCodisplay\nCommercial hcPET\n(Crystallinity 45%)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\nCodisplay PETase\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\n0\n1\n300\n320\n340\nRelative activity (Fold)\n2146\n329\n6.5\n1\nd\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n175.4 175.2 170.1\nControl PETase Codisplay\nFilm thickness (μm)\ng\nFig. 3 | Optimization of the degradation system and visualization of hcPETﬁlm\ndegradation. aEffect of temperature,b pH, andc protein concentration on PET\nhydrolysis.n = 3 independent experiments.

The change in crystallinity observed in the experiment\nwas mainly caused by enzyme digestion. The same results can also be\nobserved in hcPET samples, except that the crystallinity decreases with\nincreasing PET degradation, which suggested that the codisplay sys-\ntem exhibited no selectivity for PET hydrolysis. At the same time, the\nchange in temperature did not affect the crystallinity of the hcPETﬁlm,\nindicating that the change in crystallinity of PET was also caused by\nPETase.\nFinally, we compared the turnover rate based on the total pro-\nducts of MHET, TPA, and BHET for the puriﬁed PETase, yeast cells\nthat displayed only PETase, and those with codisplay at the optimal\ncondition using lcPET (Supplementary Fig. 23a) and hcPET (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 23b) as substrates. The conversion levels of hcPET and\nlcPET within 18 h at 30 °C were ~3.0% (depolymerization rate of 3.27\nmg\nproducts h−1 mgenzyme\n−1) and 55% (depolymerization rate of 178.15\nmgproducts h−1 mgenzyme\n−1), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 24).\nThe codisplay whole-cell biocatalyst system is robust and\nefﬁcient\nIt is expected that the codisplay cells will be used as whole-cell bio-\ncatalysts on an industrial scale; therefore, several properties related\nto industrial applications of the codisplay cells were evaluated,\nincluding thermal stability, reusability, chemical or solvent stability,\nstorage conditions, and long-term enzymatic activity. Figure 4a\nshows that the relative turnover rate of the codisplay cells remained\nat 100% when the cells were placed at 30 °C for 7 days, indicating that\nthe enzyme activity was almost unchanged during this incubation\ntime. Free PETase lost 40% of its original hydrolytic activity after\n1 day of incubation at 30 °C, and its enzyme activity was completely\nlost on theﬁfth day. These results revealed that the codisplay cells\nexhibited considerably higher thermostability\n66,67. This is one intrin-\nsic advantage of the surface display system68,69. Sanna et al. reported\nthat native HFBI did not degrade at 30 °C for 18 h62. Therefore, the\nexcellent thermostability of HFBI might play a role in the thermo-\nstability of the codisplay cells. Then, the reusability of the codisplay\ncells was investigated.\nAs shown in Fig.4b, the codisplay cells retained 85% of the ori-\nginal turnover rate after three rounds of use and 50% after seven\ncycles. There are two possible reasons for the decline in the turnover\nrate. Theﬁrst reason is that cells are inevitably lost in the recycling\nprocess. The second reason is that the degradation products might\noccupy the catalytic pocket of the displayed PETase and inhibit its\nactivities to some extent\n70. Next, we determined whether the pre-\nsence of organic solvents or detergents would affect the turnover\nrate of codisplay cells due to the pretreatment process of PET, which\noften involves these chemicals. Figure4c shows that the turnover\nrate toward hcPET retained 98, 82, and 72% when the codisplay cells\nwere incubated in the tested solutions that contained 0.1% Triton X-\n100, 10% methanol, and 10% ethanol, respectively. Compared with\nthe yeast cells that displayed PETase, the codisplay cells showed a\nhigher turnover rate at each test chemical solution\n34. For example,\nthe turnover rate of yeast cells that displayed PETase remained at just\n50% in 0.1% Triton X-100 solution\n34. The chemical stability of the\ncodisplay cells is beneﬁcial to the PET pretreatment processes, such\nas cleaning71. It is well known that hydrophobin can maintain its\nfunctional activity under extreme conditions42. Hence, the chemical\nstability of hydrophobin HFBI may be related to the stability of the\ncodisplay cells in the chemical solutions. Finally, the turnover rate of\nthe whole-cell biocatalyst was evaluated before and after lyophiliza-\ntion, which is a dehydration process that facilitates the storage and\ntransport of codisplay cells\n72. Supplementary Fig. 25 shows that the\nturnover rate of the codisplay cells toward PET remained nearly 100%\nafter freeze-drying, suggesting that the whole-cell biocatalyst\nretained almost total enzymatic activity after the dehydration\nprocess. Therefore, lyophilization is considered a storage option for\nthe future use of whole-cell biocatalysts.\nNext, we applied the codisplay cells to degrade commercial PET\nbottles. Figure4d shows that the whole-cell biocatalyst can efﬁciently\ndegrade different highly crystallized PET bottles. According to a pre-\nvious method\n13, we calculated the conversion level of the codisplay\ncells against the highly crystallized PET bottles used in our study. As\ns h o w ni nT a b l e1, the conversion levels were 3.1, 3.1, and 2.8% for\nNestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi PET bottles, respectively. In Yoshida’s\npaper, the conversion level of native PETase against hcPET was\n~0.0097%\n14. Compared to native PETase, the codisplay cells exhibited\nmuch higher degradation efﬁciency in the highly crystallized PET\nbottles. All were consistent with the conversion levels for hcPET and\nlcPET. The conversion level of the codisplay system was 3 and 55%\ntoward hcPET and lcPET, respectively, which was consistent with pre-\nvious microscopic observations. We also summarized and calculated\nthe conversion levels of several reported PETase mutants using the\nsame procedure in the Methods section (Table1). Clearly, the codis-\nplay system showed the best conversion level under 18 h for both high-\nand low-crystallinity PET. Finally, to evaluate the long-term function-\nality of the designed whole-cell biocatalyst, we used the codisplay\nsystem to degrade hcPET for 10 days. As shown in Fig.4e, f, the total\nproducts and relative conversion levels of hcPET in both the codisplay\nsystem and the display system increased with time and reached a\nmaximum around the ninth day, which was 10.9 and 1.2%, respectively.\nHowever, the degradation activity of wild-type PETase for hcPET was\nvery low, and the conversion level was only 0.003%. These results\nshowed that by establishing the codisplay system, the stability of\nPETase increases.\nAlthough the conversion level of codisplay cells against the\ncommercial bottles was the highest ever reported for any degradation\nsystem using PETase to our knowledge, there is still much room for\nimprovement. For example, we can screen and test more adhesive\nunits to further improve the binding of the yeast cell onto the PET\nsurface. By doing so, we hope that the codisplay system can be applied\nin the large-scale biological recycling of PET in the future.\nMolecular insights into the two-step degradation of PET by the\ncodisplay system\nTo explore how membrane-anchored HFBI/PETase engaged PET\nchains and how these interactions facilitated the subsequent cleavage\nof PET, all-atom MD simulations were performed. MD simulation has\nbeen adopted by several researchers to investigate the interactions\nbetween wild-type or mutant PETase and their substrate PET in soluble\nstates\n11,73–77. In the preequilibrated system (0 ns), randomly distributed\n4PET did not interact with the active center of PETase or the hydro-\nphobic region of HFBI (Fig.5a, Supplementary Fig. 26, and Supple-\nmentary Movies 1, 2). Over time, 4PET gradually aggregated near the\nhydrophobic amino acids of HFBI at ~40–50 ns. At ~60–70 ns, 4PET\ncompletely attached to the hydrophobic patch of HFBI, which occur-\nred mainly through the interaction of hydrophobic residues, and\nremained mostly bound for the rest of the trajectory. During this\nperiod, 4PET began to gather near the active center of PETase; even-\ntually, a number of 4PET molecules were gathered at ~100 ns. Calcu-\nlation of the distances between 4PET and the other two proteins\nagreed with the possible role of HFBI in the local enrichment of PETs\n(Supplementary Fig. 27). From the simulated trajectories, we postu-\nlated that our codisplay system completed PET degradation through\ntwo-step processes involving adsorption and hydrolysis, wherein the\nhydrophobin HFBI favorably binds to the PET chains and grabs the\nchains ﬁrmly (Fig.5b); then, PETase interacts with PET and performs a\nhydrolysis function (Fig.5c).\nNext, to delineate the interaction between PETase-linker-\nGCW51 and hcPET and to elucidate whether PETase-linker-GCW51\nfollows a conformational selection or induced-ﬁt mechanism, we\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 8\na\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\n12345 67\nDays\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\nCodisplay\nPETase\n1 234567\nCycles\nCodisplay\nb\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 1234 5 67 89 10 11\nNative PETase\nDisplay\nCodisplay\nhcPET\nRelative degradation (%)\nTimes (d)\nf\nc\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\nControl TritonControl Methanol Ethanol\nChemical/Solvent conditions\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000Released MHET (nmoles)\nd\nNestlé Coca-Cola Pepsi Unknown\n966 948 878\n3\nCommercial PET bottles\ne\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n01 2 3 4 5 678 9 10\nTimes (d)\nTotal products (μmoles)\nNative PETase\nDisplay\nCodisplay\nFig. 4 | The stability and functionality of the codisplay system. aThe thermo-\nstability of GS115/PETase-HFBI and puriﬁed PETase.b Effect of recycling times byP.\npastoris GS115/PETase-HFBI.c Effect of chemical/solvent conditions onP. pastoris\nGS115/PETase-HFBI and GS115/PETase-GCW51.d Degradation of commercial PET\nbottles with the whole-cell biocatalyst.

Among the codisplay systems, the hydrophobin HFBI dis-\nplayed on the yeast cell surface was proposed to function as an\nadhesive unit to enhance the attachment of codisplay cells to the\nPET surface, which would achieve the aim of efﬁcient degradation\nof hcPET by the whole-cell biocatalyst. Our data showed that the\ndisplayed HFBI causes the codisplay cells to exhibit a hydro-\nphobic surface property. A twofold increase in the binding\nnumbers of the hydrophobin-producing yeast to hydrophobic\nPET was observed under the optimal catalytic conditions.\nHydrophobic interactions between yeast cells and their substrate\nPET may play a major role in attachment.

Our results\nnot only provide an efﬁcient strategy for efﬁciently biodegrading\nhcPET but also demonstrate the plasticity of the surface display\nsystem. By introducing different functional modules into the\nsurface display system, its performance can be greatly improved.\nIn the future, more functional units, such as MHETase, that can\nhydrolyze MHET to PET reagen ts can be introduced into the\nwhole-cell biocatalyst system to further enhance its performance."}

Characterization of PETases against PET Film\nAs useful PETases will need to be active on real-world postcon-\nsumer PET, the enzymes were next evaluated for their ability to\ndegrade PET films. Each enzyme (final concentration 1 nM) was\nincubated with amorphous PET film (Goodfellow) for seven\ndays at 65 °C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris–HCl). Every 24 h, an aliquot\nwas removed and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).

Over the course of this incubation,\nthese three enzymes clearly catalyzed the formation of varying\nlevels of TPA, MHET, and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n(BHET) (Figure 3).

The high efficiency\nthat BelC exhibited onpNPB, 3PET emulsions, and PET films may\nprovide some confidence that small molecule mimics of PET can\nserve as useful compounds to enable comparative kinetic analyses\nof PETases. In contrast, OcnT is more stable than BelC, and corre-\nspondingly, OcnT catalyzed the release of only≈8 μMo fT P Aa n da\nminiscule amount of MHET under identical conditions (Figure 3C).\nThe quantity of degradants released from the PET film was\nthen used to determine the extent of depolymerization of the\nsubstrate by LCCICCG and the three novel enzymes found to be\nactive against films. Although BelC, TrmN, and OcnT are unam-\nbiguously active against PET film, the week-long treatment with\neach enzyme resulted in only 1.2%/C6 0.2%, 0.44%/C6 0.03%, and\n0.08% /C6 0.01% depolymerization, respectively. While these\nenzymes might serve as useful seed sequences for directed\nevolution campaigns to generate PETases with altered properties,\neach protein is significantly less efficient at depolymerization\nthan engineered LCCICCG. In fact, LCCICCG was shown to achieve\nnearly quantitative depolymerization of postconsumer PET waste\nafter only 24 h under similar conditions.[13] A more direct compar-\nison was facilitated by incubating LCC ICCG with amorphous\nPET film at 65 °C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris-HCl) for two days. After\nthis shortened assay, LCCICCG had depolymerized 32%/C6 3% of\nthe film substrate, demonstrating the substantial difference\nin efficiencies separating BelC, TrmN, and OcnT from this engi-\nneered PETase.\nSince AroC, TrmA, TrmD, and TrmH were apparently unable to\nhydrolyze PET film, the level of residual activity of each protein\nwas assayed against pNPB following the week-long incubation.\nWhile TrmD was largely inactive following the incubation\nwith the film, the three remaining proteins retained significant\nlevels of hydrolytic activity the 7-day reaction at 65 °C (Figure\nS9, Supporting Information). The lack of reactivity toward PET film\nby these enzymes may reflect differences in substrate specificity\nas well as access to the PET polymer chain. Both the PET emulsion\nassay and PET film assays were conducted at a temperature\nbelow the Tg of PET. At this temperature, the emulsified PET\nnanoparticles would likely be more accessible to the enzymes\nthan the PET film. In this context, it is notable that the Auclair\nlab has recently demonstrated that the commercial cutinase\nHiC is able to hydrolyze highly crystalline PET under moist-solid\nconditions.[36]\n2.6. Structural Characterization of AroC\nWe also attempted to structurally characterize several of the pro-\nteins described here to better understand their activities and\nthermostabilities. While all proteins were subjected to crystalliza-\ntion screening, conditions could only be identified for the growth\nof high-quality AroC crystals. This protein is not active on PET film\nand is minimally active on PET nanoparticles (Table 4), but the\nenzyme does exhibit a remarkably highTm (85 °C, Table 1) and\ncatalyzes the hydrolysis of 3PET (Table 3). As such, structural char-\nacterization of AroC was pursued to gain insight into the thermo-\nstability of this protein and, potentially, the stabilities of the\nother hydrolases were described here. Additionally, the experi-\nmentally determined structure of AroC could be compared with\nthe predicted structure of this protein to ensure that AlphaFold2\ncan accurately predict the structures of the α/β hydrolase\nfold-5 subfamily members that could not be crystallized.\nThe structure of AroC was resolved to a resolution of 2.25 Å\n(PDB: 9EH6) (Figure 4). The enzyme crystallized as a homodimer,\nwith each monomer exhibiting the canonical α/β hydrolase\nFigure 3. Evaluating hydrolytic activity against PET film.

The structures exhibited an\nRMSD of 1.11 Å between 93 pruned atom pairs (8.16 Å across\nall 193 pairs; Figure 4B) and the catalytic triad residues were effec-\ntively coincident (Figure S2A, Supporting Information). However,\nAroC has a distinctive loop (residues G208WYGEQPGDNPATIS222)\nthat folds over the active site (Figure 4B) that is not shared with\nLCC-PETase (Figure S1, Supporting Information).\nAlphaFold2 was then used to predict the structure of AroC, and\nthis prediction was compared to the X-ray crystal structure. The\nalignment of the two structures exhibited a global RMSD of only\n0.672 Å, suggesting that AlphaFold2 accurately predicts the struc-\ntures ofα/β hydrolase fold-5 subfamily. As such, the structures of\nthe nine other proteins described in this work were predicted\nand aligned with the experimentally derived structure of AroC.\nThis comparison indicated that each protein harbors the distinctive\nloop (G208–S222; AroC numbering) that is absent in LCC-PETase, and a\nmultiple sequence alignment demonstrated significant sequence\nconservation within and immediately preceding this loop:\nF207GxY(G/E)xQx(G/E)DxxxxI(S/T)222 (AroC numbering, Figure S11,\nSupporting Information). While this conservation is intriguing, the\nrole of this loop is not entirely clear: of the 13 first shell active site\nresidues that LCC-PETase is predicted to use to interact with a model\nof a PET trimer,[13] AroC shares 4 identical residues, and 6 others that\nare similar in polarity and size (Figure 4C,D, Figure S1, Supporting\nInformation). F207 of AroC is predicted to make a conserved\nπ-interaction with a terephthalate group, whereas Y210 and H125\nare predicted to replicate H-bonds to ester linkages, and G68, L177,\nY152, and L127 are homologs to residues in LCC-PETase that form\nhydrophobic contacts with the substrate (Figure 4D).\nNext, the predicted structures of BelC, OcnT, TrmA, TrmD,\nTrmH, TrmN, along with the X-ray crystal structure of AroC, were\nused to rationalize the thermostability of the enzymes. The\nnumber of salt bridges present on the surface of each protein\nwas determined and compared to theTm value for each protein\n(Figure 5). In general, theTm of the enzyme correlates well with\nFigure 4. A) The X-ray crystal structure of AroC (PDB: 9EH6) with catalytic triad shown as sticks.

This\nis consistent with the finding that salt bridges are more abundant\nin hyper-thermostable proteins. [38] At higher temperatures,\nthe energetic penalty associated with desolvation of charged\nresidues decreases significantly, such that salt bridges are largely\nstabilizing at elevated temperatures.[33] While the observed cor-\nrelation between thermostability and the number of salt bridges\nis not exact, it does implicate these ionic interactions as being at\nleast partially responsible for imbuing the enzymes described\nhere with exceptional thermostabilities.\n3. Conclusion\nIn this study, we made use of SSNs to mine theα/β hydrolase\nfamily for novel PET-degrading enzymes from thermophilic\norganisms. This approach proved to be highly efficient: out of\nten genes encoding putative thermophilic PETases from α/β\nhydrolase_5 subfamily, seven soluble proteins were purified\nand shown to be active toward a trimeric mimic of PET and\nPET nanoparticles, and three of these enzymes were also capable\nof degrading PET film. Given that these proteins were quite dis-\nsimilar to LCC-PETase (%ID = 18–22%), results presented here\nalso suggest that PET-active proteins may be more widely distrib-\nuted across theα/β hydrolase family than previously appreciated.\nEach new PETase described here also exhibited high thermo-\nstabilities, and structural analysis demonstrated a correlation\nbetween the number of surface salt-bridges with observedTm val-\nues. With advancements in the understanding of PETase mech-\nanisms, these naturally thermostable PETase variants can serve as\nscaffolds for directed evolution to engineer variants that are both\nthermostable and catalytically efficient. Overall, this work not only\nexpands our knowledge in enzymatic PET degradation but also\nprovides a template for the discovery of extremozymes for other\napplications.\n4. Experimental Section\nGeneral\nChemicals used to make media and buffers were obtained from\nBioshop. Genes encoding PETases were synthesized into expression\nvectors by BioBasic (Canada).

An alignment score of 45 was used to visualize the\nresulting network in Cytoscape 3.9.1. Sequences contained in this net-\nwork that were from thermophileswere identified using Cytoscape’s\nability to filter nodes on the basis of the name of the host organism.\nProtein Expression and Purification\nPlasmids encoding PETases were transformed into chemically compe-\ntent E. coli cells by heat shock and plated onto lysogeny broth\n(LB)-agar supplemented with 50 μgm L/C0 1 kanamycin. AroC, TrmA,\nand OcnT were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, while TrmD,\nTrmN, BelC, and TrmH were expressed in E. coli LOBSTR cells.\nFollowing overnight growth, a single colony was picked and used\nto inoculate 10 mL of sterile LB media. The next day, this overnight\nculture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB. The culture was allowed to\ngrow at 37 °C and 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8 was reached.\nAfter incubating the cells on ice for 10 min, expression was then\ninduced by the addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside\nto a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture was then shaken\nat 37 °C and 180 rpm for an additional 3 h before the\ncells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and 4000 /C2 g for\n10 min. Harvested cells were resuspended in binding buffer\n(20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol\nv/v) and lysed by three passes through an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer\n(Avestin, Ottawa) at 10,000 –15,000 psi. Cellular debris was then\nremoved by centrifugation at 16,000/C2 g for 1 hr and the supernatant\nwas loaded onto a Ni2þ-NTA resin that had been preequilibrated with\nbinding buffer. The column was then washed with 10–15 column vol-\numes (CVs) of binding buffer followed by elution of the protein of inter-\nest with 3–5 CVs of elution buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM\nNaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol v/v). Fractions containing pure\nenzyme were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and concentrated\nusing a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Concentrated samples\nwere buffer exchanged into storage buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6,\n100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol v/v) using a PD-10 desalting column\nor a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Protein concentrations were\nmeasured by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients\ncalculated for each protein using the ProtParam tool from Expasy.[41]\nEnzyme Activity Assays withpNPB\nReactions to assay esterase activity were performed in 976μL5 0 m M\nTris-HCl (pH 8 or 9) equilibrated at 30 °C. Aliquots of 20μL pNPB dis-\nsolved in acetone were added to achieve the desired final substrate\nconcentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 4μL\nconcentrated enzyme, and reaction progress was monitored by\nabsorbance at 405 nm using an Agilent Technologies G9864A spec-\ntrometer. Spontaneous rates of hydrolysis were measured prior to\nadding enzyme and subtracted from the observed enzymatic rate.\nInitial rates were measured at substrate concentrations between\n≈0.2/C2 and ≈5/C2 the final KM values, where possible. Plots of initial\nrates versus substrate concentration were fit to the Michaelis\nMenten equation using Origin Lab 2024. Values ofkcat were deter-\nmined using calculated enzyme extinction coefficients for enzyme\nconcentrations and ε405 = 18,000 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for p-nitrophenolate.[42]\nTm Measurements of Enzymes\nProtein samples (300μL of 1 mg mL/C0 1) were loaded into a quartz\ncuvette (Hellma USA Inc., round cylindrical cuvette, 1 mm pathlength)\nChemBioChem 2025, 26, e202500065 (8 of 11) © 2025 The Author(s).

Samples were incrementally heated from\n20 to 90 °C in 2.5 °C steps. Ellipticity was measured as a function of\ntemperature between 180 and 260 nm. The melting temperature (Tm)\nis the temperature at which the fraction unfolded (Fu) and fraction\nfolded (F) are equal. Fraction unfolded is calculated using the equa-\ntion Fu = (Fo /C0 F)/(Uf /C0 F) whereFo is the ellipticity value at each tem-\nperature, F is the ellipticity value at low temperature, andUf is the\nellipticity value at the highest temperature.\nEnzyme Thermostability Analysis\nAliquots of enzyme at 100μM in storage buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH\n7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol v/v) were placed in a water bath set at\nthe desired temperature for 0 to 24 h. At a given time, an aliquot of\nenzyme was removed, centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 1 min, then placed\non ice. 4μL of supernatant was then used to initiate the hydrolysis of\n0.5 mMpNPB at 30 °C in 1 mL 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8. Initial rates were\nmeasured in triplicate with three individual aliquots.\n3PET Synthesis[43]"}

It has also been suggested that as the\nsubstrate of this reaction is non-aqueous, classical Michaelis–\nMenten kinetics cannot be used to relate reaction rates to\ncalculated energy barriers.\n[25]\nThese energy barriers calculated in this work are suitably\nlow to suggest that none of the hydrolysis steps catalysed by Is-\nPETase constitute its rate-limiting step. By a process of\nelimination, this leaves either substrate binding or product\nrelease as candidates for the rate limiting step. This is consistent\nwith the findings from site-directed mutagenesis studies, where\nthe largest improvements in enzyme activity were obtained\nthrough mutations that are thought to affect binding.\nIn several calculation steps starting from six MD snapshots,\nthe product geometry (Figure 2) was not found to be stable,\ninstead forming an alternate product state aPS (Figure 7). The\ncarboxylic moiety of the ligand was deprotonated, having\ntransferred to the side-chain oxygen of S131 causing the ɛ-\nnitrogen on H208 and the carboxyl of D177 to be protonated.\nThe energy of this state was calculated to be up to\n\u0000 137.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nmore stable relative to the geometry of\nintermediate 4 that preceded it (Figure 5). Subsequent MD\nsimulations of the aPS state revealed that the deprotonated\nproduct forms strong hydrogen bonds with the active site\nresidues (Figure 6). This caused the ligand to persist in the\nactive site for up to 1 ns. This tendency for the product to\ndeprotonate while inside the active site might thus result in a\nsubstantial energy barrier in the product release step of the\nreaction. This would significantly hinder the enzyme’s catalytic\nefficiency."}

Very low overall barriers are computed\nfor serine protease-type hydrolysis steps (as low as\n34.1 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\n). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final prod-\nuct, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force\nindicates that product release could be rate limiting.\nIntroduction\nIn 2016, a culture of bacteria was discovered near a recycling\nplant outside Sake city in Japan that could degrade the\ncommon pollutant PET.\n[1]\nThe bacterium responsible for this\nactivity was found to be Idonella sakaiensis. Using a pair of\nenzymes PETase and MHETase, this bacterium breaks PET into\nits monomers ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TA). It\nwas predicted that the organism catabolises TA for a source of\ncarbon and energy. X-ray crystallography revealed that Is-\nPETase (EC 3.1.1.101)\n[2]\nis a member of the α-β hydrolase\nfamily,\n[3]\nwhile phylogenetic studies showed that Is-PETase\nbelongs to the cutinase family of enzymes. The chemical\nmechanism, based upon the structure (Figure 1) was proposed\nto follow two concerted nucleophilic substitution reactions,\nusing a catalytic triad motif conserved in related α-β\nhydrolases\n[4]\n(Figure 2).\nThere are several features of Is-PETase that have been\nshown to be important for the enzyme’s ability to degrade PET\n(Figure 1). The active site is situated in a shallow groove in the\nenzyme’s surface; in comparison to related cutinase enzymes,\nthis groove has been significantly enlarged and contains more\naromatic residues.\n[5]\nIt is thought that these factors assist with\nsubstrate binding. The active site is situated upon two loops, a\ndisulfide bridge that is not conserved in related enzymes has\nbeen shown to hold these two loops in position, whilst giving\nthe active site flexibility.\nSeveral enzymes had been reported to have PET degrada-\ntion activity before the discovery of Is-PETase. These enzymes\noriginated from thermophilic bacteria,\n[6]\nresulting in high\noptimum temperatures for enzymatic activity. It has been\nargued that reaction temperatures in excess of 60 ° C are\ndesirable in PETases, as this is the glass transition temperature\n(T\ng\n) of aqueous PET.\n[7]\nFor high temperature industrial enzymatic\nPET degradation, the thermophilic enzyme LCC\n[8]\nis the current\nfrontrunner. By contrast, Is-PETase operates most efficiently at\nmesophilic temperatures, outperforming all other PETases at\n30 ° C.\n[7]\nMesophilic activity makes Is-PETase a more practical\ncandidate for large-scale processes, such as waste stream\nmanagement, as it would be costly to heat such large systems.\nIs-PETase has potential to be expressed in a wider array of host\n[a] E.

The\naromatic ring of this moiety forms a π-stacking interaction with\nY59. The docking of 2PET and 3PET revealed the role of W156\nas it forms a π-stacking interaction with the second aromatic\nring of each ligand. It can be seen through comparison with the\nbinding mode of HEMT that W156 rotates its side chain to\naccommodate the longer chains of 2PET and 3PET. The\norientations of the catalytic residues S131, D177 and H208 and\nthe reactive ester bond remained consistent across the docking\ngeometries of HEMT, 2PET and 3PET. For this reason and to\nreduce calculation times, HEMT was chosen as the substrate\nmimic to be used in the rest of this study.\nThe binding pose used as a starting point for the\nsubsequent molecular dynamics simulation was selected for its\nsimilarity to binding pose found in the PDB structure 5XH3,\n[3]\nparticularly for the proximity of the ligand’s carbonyl oxygen to\nthe backbone nitrogen in the oxyanion hole.\nQM/MM methods used to calculate the energy barriers of the\ndegradation of HEMT by Is-PETase\nStarting with an enzyme–ligand complex generated by molec-\nular docking between Is-PETase and HEMT, the system was\nsolvated using a series of molecular dynamics simulations (see\nthe Supporting Information). Geometries for the intermediates\nalong the proposed reaction pathway (Figure 2) were generated\nthrough a series of restrained and unrestrained QM/MM\ngeometry optimisations. Geometries were generated sequen-\ntially (i. e., starting from previously optimised structures) to\nensure that geometries remained on the same reaction path-\nway. The transition state geometries in between these\nintermediates were then generated using the nudged elastic\nband (NEB) method. Once the geometries of intermediates and\ntransition states had been found, single-point calculations were\nperformed to refine their energies. This process was repeated\nusing seven different snapshots from the MD simulation to\nsample different conformations along the reaction pathway.\nThe resulting reaction pathways are therefore the result of the\ndiffering starting geometries obtained from MD simulations.\nFor the reaction NS1, the reaction pathway (red line in\nFigure 5, left) with the lowest overall energy barriers had an\nactivation energy of 28.9 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwith reaction step LgR1\nresponsible for the highest energy barrier. For the reaction NS2,\nthe reaction pathway with the lowest overall energy barriers\n(red line in Figure 5, right) had an activation energy of\n34.1 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwith reaction step Nuc2 responsible for the\nhighest energy barrier (Figures 2 and 5). Nuc2 has the highest\nactivation energy across reactions NS1 and NS2.\nThe step connecting intermediates I2 and I3 involves the\ndissociation of the EG leaving group present in I2, followed by\nthe association of a water molecule which will function as the\nnucleophile in Nuc2. The driving force for this step could not be\ncalculated with sufficient accuracy using our QM/MM protocol.\nIf the substrate exchange were endergonic (pushing the second\nprofile up relative to the first one) the predicted overall barrier\nwould increase correspondingly. However, seeing that EG and\nwater binding will be dominated by hydrogen-bonding inter-\nactions with similar strength, no significant driving force for this\nstep is to be expected. In addition, it is expected that the\ndissociation of EG will occur without any significant energy\nbarrier as the molecule forms no strong interactions with either\nthe active site of the enzyme or the bound ligand and no major\nrearrangement of the protein backbone is required to release\nthe product. The association of a water molecule into a\nnucleophilic position is similarly expected to occur without a\nsignificant energy barrier as H208 will readily form hydrogen\nbonds with bulk solvent in absence of EG in the active site. We\nthus assume that the two legs of the reaction in Figure 5 can be\nseamlessly connected and evaluate our overall barriers assum-\ning zero driving force for the EG/water exchange.\nThe geometry of the Nuc2 transition state shows some\nstabilisation of the formal negative charge that is forming on\nthe carbonyl oxygen of the substrate en route to the tetrahedral\nintermediate I4 (through hydrogen bonds involving backbone\nnitrogen atoms of Y58 and M132, with distances of 2.6 and\nFigure 3.

The latter distance is quite\nlong, suggesting less than optimal stabilisation in the TS (this\ndistance closes to 2.7 Å in the subsequent intermediate;\nFigure 6, bottom). The nucleophilic water molecule must be\ndeprotonated by H208 whilst having an orientation suitable for\nnucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon. To accommodate\nthis, a rotation of the side chain of S131 occurs, pulling the\ncarbonyl oxygen out of the oxyanion hole. (Figure 6). The width\nof the active site of Is-PETase does not permit the nucleophilic\nattack of water to occur whilst efficiently stabilising the\ndeveloping negative charge. Analysis of the transition states\nNuc1 and Nuc2 across each reaction pathway calculated\nrevealed that the degree of stabilisation of the negative charge\ndeveloping on the carbonyl oxygen of the ligand has the\nlargest effect on the activation energy of the corresponding\nreaction step. The same trend as discussed above holds for the\nset of Nuc1 and Nuc2 transition state geometries: The shorter\nthe M132 backbone nitrogen – ligand carbonyl oxygen in the\ntransition state, the lower the associated activation energy (R\n2\n=\n0.81 for Nuc1 and R\n2\n= 0.87 for Nuc2). Far weaker correlations\nwere found for the equivalent distance with the Y58 nitrogen.\nThis is due to this distance being consistently shorter, with less\nvariance. Plots of this data can be found in the Supporting\nInformation.\nThis might be an evolutionary compromise that has been\nmade as the expanded active site allows for better substrate\nbinding.\nNote that, in particular for step NS1, a notable spread of\nbarriers is computed for the pathways starting from different\nMD snapshots. However, even the largest overall barrier\nobtained for all pathways, 62.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\n, should be readily\nsurmountable at room temperature.\nThe barriers for our most favourable pathways are lower\nthan those reported in previous QM/MM studies (between ca.\n60–80 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwhen using M06-2X and PBE functionals in the\nQM regions\n[20–22]\n). Our results therefore confirm previous\npredictions at the lower end of this range and, in view of the\nspread discussed above, highlight the need to trace multiple\npathways in order to avoid spuriously high barriers from a\nsingle one.\nFigure 5. Energy profiles calculated for the two reactions catalysed by Is-\nPETase (Figure 2), NS1 (top) and NS2 (bottom). The lowest energy profile\nacross each reaction (red) has the rate-limiting step Nuc2, with an energy\nbarrier of 34.1 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\n. The grey lines represent energy profiles for reactions\nstarting at MD snapshots with higher activation energies.\nFigure 6.

The reaction was initiated by adding 500 nM to 1600 nM\nenzymes and incubated for 1 to 28 hours at the enzyme’s\noptimal temperature and 1000 rpm on an Eppendorf Thermo-\nMixer. To determine the optimal temperature, experiments\nbetween 30–70 ° C were performed. The hydrolysis reactions\nwere stopped at 95 ° C for 10 minutes and the microplastic was\ncentrifuged at 11,000 rpm for two minutes. The enzymatic\nactivity of the designed variants was measured as previously\ndescribed.\n[23]\n10-100 μL of the reaction mixture was pipetted\ninto a black 96-well plate and the volume was adjusted to\n100 μL with bicine buffer. The reaction to produce fluorescent\n2-hydroxy terephthalate (HOTP), was initiated by adding 25 μL\nof 5 mM EDTA and 25 μL of 5 mM FeSO\n4\nwith a multichannel\npipet. Finally, 25 μL of 2 % H\n2\nO\n2\nwas added by mixing the\nreaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was\nincubated for 60 min at room temperature before the\nfluorescence was measured with a plate reader from CLARIOstar\nBMG-Labtech Australia (λ\nex\n= 320 nm, and λ\nem\n= 420 nm). We\ninterpolated the concentration of TPA based on a calibration\ncurve of terephthalic acid (TPA) between 0–500 μM. The PET\nhydrolase variants were compared to the previous variants as a\nreference to determine whether the enzymatic activity has\nincreased, and experiments were performed in triplicate.\nUPLC Analysis of PET Hydrolysis\nTo determine TPA and MHET concentrations, we employed\nUltra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) using an\nAcquity UPLC i-Class equipped with a QDa performance mass\ndetector (Waters). The chromatogram extraction was conducted\nat a wavelength of 254 nm. The UPLC system utilized an\nAcquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle\nsize). The mobile phases employed were as follows: mobile\nphase A consisted of 99.9 % Milli-Q Water + 0.1 % formic acid,\nand mobile phase B was composed of 99.9 % Acetonitrile +\n0.1 % formic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 0.400 mL/\nmin, and a sample volume of 1 μL was injected three times for\neach analysis. Following sample injection, the mobile phase\ncomposition transitioned from 95 % A to 100 % B over a 4.50-\nminute interval and remained at 100 % B for 1 minute.\nSubsequently, it was changed back to 95 % A over 0.5 minutes\nand held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. To\ninterpolate the concentrations of TPA and MHET, we prepared\ncalibration curves ranging from 0 to 500 μM by utilising the\nmass of each compound.\nProtein Crystallisation and Structure Determination\nCrystals of the PETase variants were grown by vapour diffusion\nin MRC 2 sitting-drop plates (Swissci) setting up drops at a 1 : 1\nratio with 150 nl of protein and 150 nl of mother liquor using\nthe Phoenix Crystal (Art Robbins) liquid handling platform with\ncrystallisation conditions described in Supplementary Table S8.\nCrystals grew after a couple of days and prior to flash cooling in\nliquid nitrogen were cryoprotected with a final concentration of\n15 % glycerol added to the reservoir before overlaying onto the\ndrop. Diffraction experiments were carried out at the Australian\nSynchrotron MX2 beamline\n[48]\nunder nitrogen vapor at 100K\nand a wavelength of 0.974 Å. Data reduction was carried out\nwith XDS\n[48]\nfor indexing and integration followed by scaling\nand merging with Aimless.\n[49]\nAutomated implementation of the\nsame programs was utilised with autoPROC.\n[50]\nMolecular\nreplacement was carried out with Phaser\n[51]\nvia a model derived\nfrom the PDB ID 6EQE.\n[43]\nThe model was iteratively built and\nrefined with Coot 0.8.9\n[51]\nand Refmac 5.7\n[52]\n(Combi-PETase/\nPETase\nACCCETN\n) via the CCP4i2 user interface,\n[53]\nPhenix\n(PETase\nACC\n),\n[54]\nor autoBUSTER (PETase\nACCC\nand PETase\nACCE\n).\n[55]\nStatistics for structure solution and refinement are presented in\nSupplementary Table S7."}

This residue is directly interacting with the\nHEMT moiety, but because HEMT is a small molecule, the\nstructure does not reveal other residues that might be involved\nin binding the PET substrate. To identify these residues, we\nperformed a model of a Michaelis complex using a 8mer-PET\npolymer as a substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). Our model\nindicated that in addition to the interactions with W185, the\n8mer-PET polymer is also interacting with residues in the β6-β7\nloop (preceded by W185). We performed molecular dynamics\nsimulations of various substitutions at position 186 and found a\nstrong dependence of the flexibility of the sidechain of W185\nand the β6-β7 loop on the size of residue 186 (Supplementary\nFigure S3).\nThe beneficial effect of the flexibility of W185 and the loops\nin the active site with the PET hydrolytic activity has been also\nhighlighted by Chen et al.\n[35]\nand Crnjar et al.\n[36]\nwhen studying\nthe double mutant S214H/I218F. Based on the MD simulations,\nwe mutated residue D186 to alanine, the residue that was\npredicted to confer the highest flexibility to the wobbly\ntryptophan and the β6-β7 loop. The PETase variant D186A\n(PETase\nA\n) exhibited an increase in melting temperature of\n~10 ° C while at the same time retaining a high level of activity\nup even at 50 ° C. In the 1.6 Å crystal structure of our variant\nCombi-PETase (Figure 2), we refined W185 and observed that\nthe modelled density around the sidechain of W185 is not\ncompletely supported by an occupancy of 1, as well as\nadditional density adjacent but not connected to this residue.\nHowever, the additional density was not enough to confidently\nmodel a second conformation as observed in previous\nstructures.\n[37][34]\nTogether with the high B-factors on the atoms\nof W185, it does suggest that W185 is in fact flexible\n(Supplementary Figure S6A).\nD186 is not conserved in other cutinase enzymes and is\nmost commonly a histidine in thermostable homologs, so the\nsingle mutant of PsPETase D186A had not been explored\nbefore. The substitution D186H alone does not provide better\nactivity but it led to the development of ThermoPETase\n[11]\nwhich\nserved as scaffold for developing other variants like\nFigure 1.

Recently, using a semi-saturation muta-\ngenesis experiment, Yin et al. identified the double variant\nD186A/S121P. Because the crystal structure of the S121P/D186A\ndouble mutant could not resolve various conformations of\nW185 side chain, the authors explained the increased activity\nwas caused by a reduction in the flexibility.\n[38]\nHowever, the\nauthors did not note that this is also common in other crystal\nstructures of PsPETase variants, and that the different conforma-\ntions of the so-called wobbly tryptophan W185 is not always\nresolved in multiple conformations. Nailing down all the\npossible conformations is difficult- seeing that density is missing\nis easy.\nPETase\nACC\n– Generation 2\nTo further improve the thermal stability of our PETase\nA\nvariant,\nwe introduced a third disulfide bridge using the N233C and\nS282C mutations. The design of this disulfide bridge was based\non the work of Then et al., who identified a stabilizing calcium\nbinding site in TfCut2, a homolog enzyme with 51 % sequence\nsimilarity of PETase.\n[39]\nBy engineering a disulfide bridge in that\nposition, the authors mimicked the effect of calcium binding\nand increased the Tm of TfCut2 by 24.9 ° C.\n[40]\nSimilar substitu-\ntions were performed on Cut190,\n[41]\nLCC,\n[42]\nand\nThermoPETase.\n[11]\nBased on a structural alignment between\nTfCut2 and PETase\nA\n, the equivalent disulfide bridge was\nengineered between residues N233 and S282. The triple mutant\nPET\nACC\ndisplayed a cooperative effect on the thermal stability\nelevating the melting temperature by another 11.4 ° C (to\n64.7 ° C). The increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nallows\na much higher activity compared to PETase\nA\nat a reaction\ntemperature of 50 ° C. The formation of the disulfide bond\nbetween N233C and S282C was confirmed to be present and\nfully occupied in the electron density of the Combi-PETase\nstructure (Supplementary Figure S6C) and the structure of the\nPETase\nACC\n(PDB accession code 8VEL).\nPETase\nACCCET\n– Generation 3\nFurther attempts to improve the thermal stability of our\nPETase\nACC\nvariant by rational design only led to modest\nimprovements. Individually, the A179C, S136E and S214T (CET)\nmutations each increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nby\nca. 3.2 ° C, 0.9 ° C and 2.1 ° C respectively (Supplementary Ta-\nble S3). However, the effect of these mutations was additive\nand the combined mutant PETase\nACCCET\ndisplayed a Tm of\n67.8 ° C (Figure 1A, Table 1), sufficient to increase the optimal\nreaction temperature to 60 ° C.\nThe A179C variant fills a hydrophobic cavity in the core of\nthe enzyme, a strategy that is commonly used to improve the\nthermal stability of mesophilic enzymes.\n[41]\nThis effect is\napparent in the density around residue A179C in the crystal\nstructure of Combi-PETase (Supplementary Figure S6D).\nThe mutant S136E has a small effect on the thermal stability\nof the enzyme as measured by DSF, but it also showed a 1.3-\nfold increase in hydrolytic activity compared to our PETase\nACC\nvariant and was compatible with the other mutations, so it was\nretained for future generations. In the crystal structure we do\nnot see the direct formation of any new salt bridge by the\nS136E substitution, so the effect may be due to a transient\nintraprotein interaction or to an improvement in enzyme-\nsolvent interactions.\nThe S214T variant increased the enzymatic activity by 12 %\n(Supplementary Table S3). Both the crystal structure of Combi-\nPETase (this work) and of the wild type (PDB 6EQE)\n[43]\nresolve\nthe sidechain of residue 214 in three different orientations with\nsimilar occupancies. Molecular dynamics simulations show that\nin the wild type, S214 (located in β7-α4 loop) preferably makes\na hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of P184, located at the start\nof the β6-β7 loop, while the mutation to threonine (T214)\nbreaks this interaction (Figure 2F and G). This can enhance the\nflexibility of the β6-β7 loop and the binding site, explaining the\nincreased activity of this variant. Both A179C and S214T are\nnewly discovered mutations, while S136E has been previously\nshown present similar beneficial effects on the wild type\nsequence.\n[44]\nPETase\nACCCETN\n– Generation 4\nIn a previous publication we performed an Ancestral Sequence\nReconstruction (ASR) experiment on the wild type PsPETase, in\nwhich identified some ancestor sequences that showed\nimproved thermostability.\n[20]\nContinuing from this, we inte-\ngrated and tested several of the ASR designs into our\nPETase\nACCCET\nvariant (Supplementary Table S4) and identified the\nK95N mutation which exhibited a further increase in thermal\nstability (Tm = 70.4 ° C) and a 12 % increase in terms of\nenzymatic activity. Two directed evolution experiments ren-\ndered variants that included the K95N mutation: HOT-PETase\n[21]\nand PETaseTM,\n[43]\n(with 21 and 2 mutations respectively).\nCombining Machine Learning/AI Mutations to the PETase\nACCCETN\nA new variant (FAST-PETase) has recently been developed using\na ML-based enzyme engineering method (MutCompute)\n[13]\nand\nbased on the ThermoPETase variant. The authors predicted and\ntested 159 mutations and identified three of them (N233K,\nR224Q and S121E) that when added to the ThermoPETase\n(D186H/R280A) yielded a variant with high activity at an\noptimal temperature of 50 ° C. From the FAST-PETase mutations,\nthe N233K mutant is of particular interest, because introducing\nthis single point mutation on other homologous PET-degrading\nenzymes also produces enzymes with higher degradation rates.\nWiley VCH Dienstag, 07.05.2024\n2410 / 350675 [S. 178/183]\n1\nChemBioChem 2024, 25, e202400084 (5 of 10) © 2024 The Authors.

We introduced the N233K mutant into our Combi-\nPETase, noting that this mutation would break the engineered\ndisulfide bridge between residue N233C and S282C. Because it\nis difficult to compare the results from the literature given that\nthe reaction conditions and the substrates often differ,\n[21]\nwe\ndecided to order, express, purify and test the FAST-PETase\nsequence as from the literature but using our activity assay and\nsubstrates.\n[13]\nThe new variant derived from FAST-PETase and\nCombi-PETase (namely PETase\nAKCETN\n) showed a modest Tm\ndecrease to 67.5 ° C compared to Combi-PETase and a reduction\nof 10 ° C of the optimum temperature back to 50 ° C, same as the\nFAST-PETase variant. (Figure 1A and 1C, Table 1). The activity of\nPETase\nAKCETN\nat 50 ° C is the same as Combi-PETase at the same\ntemperature but lower than the Combi-PETase at 60 ° C.\nHowever, the yield of the PETase\nAKCETN\nvariant is much higher\n(Figure 1B, Table 1).\nAssessing the Enzyme’s Suitability for Industrial Applications\nDue to higher activity and protein yields, we evaluated the\nsuitability of the Combi-PETase and PETase\nAKCETN\nvariants for\nindustrial applications. For these two variants, we performed\nlong-term reaction experiments at high temperatures and high\nenzyme concentrations, and we also tested the residual activity\nof Combi-PETase against a high-crystalline PET substrate.\nFigure 3 shows the enzymes’ activity at 50 and 60 ° C for up\nto 28 hours using FAST-PETase as a control. While at 50 ° C, all\nthese enzymes perform similarly after either 2 or 28 hours\n(Figure 3A, and Supplementary Figure S4), at 60 ° C Combi-\nPETase performs better than PETase\nAKCETN\n, which in turn is better\nthan FAST-PETase.\nWild type PsPETase has been noted to show a concentration\ninhibition effect when the enzyme’s concentration exceeds\n150 nM.\n[6]\nAlthough the reason for this inhibition is not fully\nunderstood, this is a problem for industrial applications. Avilan\net al. has shown that it is also present in other mesophilic\nenzymes and that it can be improved using protein engineering\nto increase the thermal stability, by adding additives to the\nreaction (e. g. DMSO), or by modifying the substrate (increasing\nthe polymer surface area).\n[45]\nHotPETase, a variant generated by\na directed mutagenesis approach,\n[24]\nis an example of a highly\nthermostable variant that shows reduced inhibition by enzyme\nconcentration. This effect is also displayed in our Combi-PETase,\nwhere we observe at least a 4-fold increase in the optimal\nenzyme concentration for the reaction (to ~800 nM, Figure 3C).\nPsPETase has been discovered to naturally break down low\ncrystalline PET (lc-PET). However, high crystalline PET (hc-PET) is\na prevalent waste product that is difficult to break down by all\nknown PETases. To determine the effect of the crystallinity of\nthe substrate on the reaction rate of our Combi-PETase, we\ntested the enzyme against both hc-PET (post-consumer Coca-\nCola bottle, ca. 45 % crystallinity)\n[46]\nand lc-PET (powdered\nGoodFellow PET film, amorphous). We measured the degrada-\ntion products (TPA and MHET) over 28 hours using UPLC\n(Figure 4). As usual for all PET hydrolases, lc-PET is more\nsusceptible to breakdown by Combi-PETase than hc-PET,\nresulting in a total of 29 mM and 19 mM of total released\nproducts respectively. However, this means that the Combi-\nPETase retains 65 % of the activity against hc-PET, which is very\nhigh compared to other PETase enzymes.\n[19,47]\nIndeed, LCC\nIGGA\nvariant retains between 25–35 % activity when reacting with\nmicroparticles (� 250 μm) of 32–35 % crystalline PET.\n[20]\nMost\nPET degrading enzymes also show less than 50 % activity\nagainst PET film substrates with 13–23 % crystallinity.\n[17]"}

Further generations also\nbased on rational design improved the thermostability by\nanother 4 ° C and the activity by 43 % but further improvements\nwere difficult. A new mutation based on the ASR method\nfurther improved the enzyme’s stability by another 2 ° C and\nincreased the activity by 10 %. The SDS-PAGE gel shows that\nthe amount of soluble Combi-PETase protein was qualitatively\nincreased with respect to the wild type PsPETase (Figure S8),\nwhile the amount of purified Combi-PETase protein was\nincreased by 25-fold (Figures S9 and S10). The increased\nsolubility of Combi-PETase is also reflected in the decrease in\nthe concentration-dependent inhibition, which means that the\nCombi-PETase can be efficiently used at 800 nM concentration\ninstead of < 150 nM for the wild type PsPETase. Based on AI\nmethods, the N233K mutation was proposed. Introducing this\nmutation to the Combi-PETase variant improved the protein\nyields, but it also reduced its thermostability and activity.\nTherefore, it was not included in our final variant.\nEach technique contributed to the advancement of the\nengineered Combi-PETase (PETase\nACCCETN\n). We highlight the\nimportance of applying these approaches simultaneously as\neach of them has its strengths and limitations. The biggest\nimprovements were based on understanding the structure of\nthe protein, the substrate binding mode, and the mechanism of\naction. ASR and AI-based tools were more effective in\npredicting the impact of remote mutations on the enzyme‘s\nproperties, which were challenging to foresee with structure-\nbased protein engineering. Although we may not fully under-\nstand how remote mutations affect the protein‘s biophysics in\ndetail, their beneficial effects are evident.\nOverall, this study demonstrates a successful example of a\ncombinatorial enzyme engineering experiment, using\nstructure-, bioinformatics- and AI-based strategies. We have\nengineered the Combi-PETase variant to perform better in\nterms of protein yields, thermostability, activity, tolerance to\nhigh enzyme concentration and longer reaction times; com-\npared to the wildtype PsPETase and most of the published\nPETase enzymes. It is highly active over a range of temperatures\nand can hydrolyze not only lc-PET but also hc-PET with high\nefficiency. These are all desirable biophysical and biochemical\nproperties when considering the enzyme for industrial applica-\ntions. However, we have not upscaled the process or directly\ncompared the Combi-PETase under standardized industry-like\nconditions against other PETase enzymes as done for other\nvariants.\n[21]"}

The two amino acid\nsubstitutions (W159H/S238F) (Figure 1) in the DM induce\nnarrowing of the active site cleft (Figure 1B) compared to the\nWT enzyme (PDB ID: 6EQE)\n[6]\n(Figure 1E), and otherwise result in\nminimal conformational changes to the structure (Figure S2).\nDespite the small change in overall structure, these point\nmutations have a marked effect on the thermal stability of the\nDM enzyme relative to the WT (Figure 1D, Figure S3). The\napparent T\nm\nof the WT is 46.76 � 0.04 ° C, measured by differ-\nential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while the apparent T\nm\nof the\nDM is 56.49 � 0.22 ° C (Figure 1D). In comparing the thermody-\nnamic stability (resistance to thermal unfolding) of each enzyme\nas a function of temperature, the WT and DM enzymes have\ncomparable stability at 30 ° C (Figure S3A). As the temperature\nincreases, the relative stability of the DM compared to the WT\nincreases, reaching a maximum relative difference in stability at\n47 ° C (Figure S3B). At 47 ° C, the WT has a 19 fold increased\npropensity for thermal denaturation compared to the DM at the\nsame temperature.\nSubstrates used in this study include amorphous and\ncrystalline PET\nThe primary PET substrates utilized for all studies include an\namorphous film (2.0 � 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented\nfilm (30.7 � 5.5 % crystallinity), and a crystalline powder (37.7 �\n2.6 % crystallinity), all sourced from Goodfellow, unless noted\notherwise.

The reaction buffer\nfor samples without DMSO (\u0000 DMSO) was 50 mm NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n,\n100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The solvent inclusion condition (+ DMSO)\nwas performed using a buffer comprising 90 % (v/v) 50 mm\nNaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 100 mm NaCl, 10 % (v/v) DMSO, pH 7.5. Agitation was\nperformed using an incubated orbital shaker at 225 rpm.\nIn comparing product release between PET substrates, this\nstudy highlights the impact of substrate selection on conversion\nextent. For both enzymes in most reaction conditions, a 2–5\nfold increase in total product release is measured for reactions\ncontaining crystalline powder compared to the same mass\nloading of an amorphous film (Figure 2). These results also\nhighlight that the WT and the DM have different temperature-\ndependent activity profiles, where a change of 10 ° C in the\nreaction temperature has a larger differential effect on catalytic\nperformance for the DM at 48 and 96 h reaction times.\nIn general, product release was highest in the presence of\nDMSO, while agitation resulted in slightly less product release,\non average. Reactions without DMSO tended to reach a lower\nPET conversion extent over 48 and 96 h, which is most apparent\nfor reactions with amorphous PET. The DM enzyme on\ncrystalline PET exhibits the least variation in PET conversion\nacross all four conditions tested (Figure 2G, H). As the + DMSO/-\nAgitation condition generally resulted in the highest PET\nconversion, all subsequent reactions presented subsequently\nwere performed using this reaction condition, unless noted\notherwise.\nReaction progress and endpoint analysis reveal differential\nactivity profiles for the WT and DM enzymes\nHydrolytic performance on PET was evaluated for the WT and\nDM at 30 and 40 ° C to assess how the difference in apparent T\nm\nmight influence the rate and extent of PET conversion. The\nlower temperature is the isolation temperature of the host\norganism\n[3]\nand the typical reaction temperature reported for\nIsPETase activity. The higher temperature, which is below the\napparent T\nm\nof the WT, was selected to identify if increased\ntemperature would result in faster conversion.\nConversion extent was evaluated by substrate mass loss\nand measurement of the aromatic monomers released [as the\nsum of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono(2-\nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and TPA]. The effect of\nreaction temperature was examined over 168 h using two\nenzyme loadings [0.2 mg enzyme g\n\u0000 1\nPET (Figure S5, Table S4)\nand 1.0 mg enzyme g\n\u0000 1\nPET (Figure 3, Table S5)], and a\nsubstrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) of amorphous PET\nfilm. The resulting trend in reaction progress curves is similar\nfor both enzymes at both enzyme loadings, where reactions\nincubated at 40 ° C accumulate more aromatic product at early\ntime points (< 48 h) (Figure 3A). For the WT, at 40 ° C product\naccumulation plateaus by 48 h, while at 30 ° C the enzyme\ncontinues hydrolyzing amorphous PET film through the 168 h\ntimepoint. The DM exhibits low relative activity at 30 ° C, but at\n40 ° C remains active through 168 h and accumulates the\nhighest total concentration of aromatic product monomer from\n72 h onward.\nFigure 2. Contribution of agitation and DMSO to product release. Enzymatic conversion of PET reported as the sum of aromatic products released from (A–\nD) an amorphous PET film substrate, and (E–H) a crystalline PET powder substrate at 48 and 96 h for the WT and DM. Graphs show a comparison of reactions\nwith and without 10 % DMSO in the reaction mixture, and with or agitation of the reaction, using an orbital shaker.

Given the nature of the insoluble PET substrates\nhydrolyzed by these enzymes, achieving the conditions re-\nquired for the convMM reactions is not trivial, and therefore we\nexplored both kinetic models. Using the kinetic parameters\nderived from these models, we can compare the performance\nof each enzyme by comparing affinity between the enzyme and\nthe substrate (\nconv\nK\nm\n, Equation S1 and\ninv\nK\nm\n, Equation S2) and\nmaximal reaction velocity (\nconv\nV\nmax\n, Equation S3 and\ninv\nV\nmax\n,\nEquation S4).\nSpecifically, sacrificial samples were generated for each time\npoint over a reaction time of 6–10 h (while initial reaction rates\nremain linear). Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting\nfor both enzymes at 30 and 40 ° C on two different PET\nsubstrates, amorphous PET film and a crystalline PET powder.\nInitial rate measurements were collected for the convMM\ndataset (Figure 4, Table 1) using 950 nm enzyme and varying\nthe substrate loading over a range of 0–11.6 % by mass (0–\n116 g L\n\u0000 1\n) to identify a saturating substrate load, or when\nsubstrate is sufficiently in excess that all enzymes in the\nreaction are engaged. Initial rate measurements were also\ncollected for the invMM dataset (Figure 5, Table 1) using a\nsubstrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) and varying the\nenzyme loading over a range of 0–2 mg enzyme per g PET\nFigure 3.

The data are generally well-represented by the\nconventional (Equation S1) and inverse (Equation S2) MM\nequations (Figures 4 and 5). An exception to the conventional\nMM model is observed in the case of WT-40 ° C on crystalline\nPET powder (Figure 4B). At 40 ° C, the WT showed the expected\nbehavior at low substrate loadings, but turnover rate decreases\nat higher substrate loadings (Figure 4B), leading to a poor fit of\nEquation S1 (Figure S6, Table S7). This behavior was not\nobserved in previous interfacial kinetics studies using the same\nsubstrate;\n[15]\nhowever, in those studies only the DM was tested\nand the substrate loadings evaluated were much lower,\nencompassing 0–0.6 % loading by mass (0–6 g L\n\u0000 1\nPET). Data for\nthe convMM plots using WT-40 ° C on crystalline powder were\nfitted until the drop in turnover rate, from 0–58 g L\n\u0000 1\nPET\nloading (Figure 4B).\nThe convMM and invMM datasets for each enzyme/temper-\nature combination are in accord, showing that reaction\nvelocities for the WT and DM are higher on the crystalline\npowder, except in the case of the DM at 30 ° C. This increased\nreaction velocity is likely due to the higher surface area of the\npowder, and therefore increased availability of reaction sites. It\nis important to note that the powder is more crystalline\n(Table S2), and previous studies suggest that the amorphous\nregions of the polymer are preferentially depolymerized by PET\nhydrolases.\n[16]\nRegardless, the WT and DM generally show higher\naffinity (based on\nconv\nK\nm\nvalues) and catalytic efficiency (based\non the specificity constant =\nconv\nk\ncat\n/\nconv\nK\nm\n, Table S8) for the\npowder substrate compared to the amorphous film. Compar-\nison of derived kinetic parameters from the convMM datasets\n(Table 1) reveals that while there is variation in catalytic rate\n(k\ncat\n) across enzymes, temperatures, and substrates, the range is\nnot overly large. This is unexpected, given the increase in\nreaction temperature.\n[17]\nRather, there is a large variation in\nconv\nK\nm\nacross enzymes and temperatures. The\nconv\nK\nm\nvalues drop\nsignificantly between the 30 and 40 ° C reactions for both\nenzymes on both substrates, indicating there is a temperature\ndependence for affinity between the enzyme and the substrate.\nOn amorphous film, the specificity constant of the WT\nincubated at 30 ° C is comparable to the DM incubated at 30 ° C,\nand similarly WT-40 ° C is comparable to the DM-40 ° C (Table S8).\nOn crystalline PET powder, however, the WT has much higher\nspecificity than the DM at both temperatures (Table S8).\nComparison of the derived kinetic parameters from the\ninvMM datasets (Table 1) shows that WT requires less enzyme\nto reach saturation on amorphous PET.

Notably, the reactive\nsite density calculated for the WT on crystalline powder is\nhigher than the DM on the same substrate.\nKinetic parameters derived from initial rates are not\npredictive of reaction productivity over longer reaction times\nSubstrate loading, extent of conversion, residence time, and\nenzyme loading are key performance metrics that drive process\ncost for enzymatic PET recycling.\n[9b]\nEvaluation of reaction\nproductivity as a function of enzyme loading and substrate\nloading can thus help identify optimal process conditions. To\nthat end, we measured product release over 96 h for the WT\nenzyme at 30 and 40 ° C and for the DM enzyme at 40 ° C,\nevaluating the impact of substrate loading and enzyme loading\non performance over three productivity measures: the rate of\naromatic product release over a designated reaction duration\n(24 h in Figure 6A, D, G, 10 and 48 h in Figures S7 and S8), the\nrate of product release per unit of enzyme (Figure 6B, E, H), and\npercent conversion of the initial substrate (Figure 6C, F, I). All\nreactions used crystalline powder, substrate loadings of 2.9–\n23.2 % by mass (29–232 g L\n\u0000 1\n), and enzyme loadings of 0.5–\n3 mg enzyme per g PET.\nFor optimization of total product release per unit of time,\nevaluation of the reactions at 24 h shows that increasing the\nsubstrate loading and the enzyme loading yields the highest\nconcentrations of product release per hour (Figure 6A, D, G).\nPerformance was also evaluated at 10 and 48 h to evaluate\ndifferent reaction times (Figures S7–S9). For all three reaction\ndurations analyzed (10–48 h), the DM at 40 ° C showed the\nhighest overall product release rate (Figure 6G, Figures S7 and\nS8).\nFor optimization of product release rate per unit of enzyme\nin the reaction, after 24 h reaction time, two trends are\nobserved. Reactions at 40 ° C are optimized at high enzyme\nloadings and low substrate loadings (Figure 6E, H). In contrast,\nFigure 6. Functional catalytic performance as a function of enzyme and substrate loading. Comparative performance evaluation at 24 h for the WT enzyme at\n30 and 40 ° C and the DM enzyme at 40 ° C using crystalline PET powder substrate.

Various enzyme and substrate loadings were tested for\nperformance optimization. For substrate loadings, from least to most: 2.9 % (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n), 5.8 % (58 g L\n\u0000 1\n), 11.6 % (116 g L\n\u0000 1\n), and 23.2 % (232 g L\n\u0000 1\n); for enzyme\nloadings, from least to most: 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mg g\n\u0000 1\n.

The DM enzyme incubated at 40 ° C demon-\nstrates the highest product release rates per mg of enzyme\nmeasured in this comparison at high enzyme loadings (2–3 mg\nenzyme per g PET) and the lowest substrate loading (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n)\n(Figure 6H).\nFor optimization of the reaction based on substrate\nconversion, unsurprisingly, low solids loading and high enzyme\nloading result in the highest percent of depolymerization of the\nsubstrate for all reaction conditions tested (Figure 6C, F, I).\nAgain, the DM at 40 ° C demonstrates the highest overall\nconversion of the 29 g L\n\u0000 1\nsubstrate samples (Figure 6I).\nIncreased PET conversion correlates with increased PET film\ncrystallinity until a crystallinity threshold\nEnzyme specificity as it relates to substrate crystallinity is a key\neconomic and sustainability driver for biological PET\nhydrolysis.\n[9b]\nImproved rates (Table 1) and conversion extents\n(Figure 2) were observed for crystalline PET powder compared\nto amorphous PET film. To decouple the influence of increased\nsolvent accessible surface area from the influence of substrate\ncrystallinity in these observations, we examined product release\nusing PET films with the same surface area and varying\ncrystallinity. Conversion extent after 96 h was measured using\nan amorphous film (2.0 � 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented\nfilm (30.7 � 5.5 % crystallinity), and annealed films with crystal-\nlinities ranging from 3.0 � 1.7 to 25.1 � 1.8 % (Figure 7, Fig-\nure S10A, Table S9). In general, conversion extent after 96 h\nincreased as crystallinity increased until the percent crystallinity\ncrossed a threshold around 20 % (Figure 7). Samples with 16.4 �\n1.2 % crystallinity show the highest product release, while a\nhighly crystalline annealed film (25.1 � 1.8 %) and the biaxially\noriented film (30.7 � 5.5 %) demonstrate low conversion extents\n(Figure 7).\nWT and DM enzymes display different sensitivities to\naccumulation of depolymerization products\nHigh extents of conversion will result in the accumulation of\nhigh concentrations of product monomer. To understand how\nmonomer accumulation influences IsPETase, we first investi-\ngated the influence of monomer accumulation on BHET\nhydrolysis over a timescale that affords complete or near-\ncomplete substrate conversion. Using an initial substrate\nconcentration of 2.25 mm BHET and 50 nm of the WT or DM,\nconversion was monitored over 18 h at 30 ° C (Figure 8). For the\nWT, 12.0 � 1.1 % of the initial substrate concentration remains\nafter 18 h (Figure 8A), while for the DM only 1.4 � 0.2 % remains\n(Figure 8D). To test the hypothesis that the WT is more\nsusceptible to slowed hydrolysis due to accumulation of MHET,\nwe next tested the same reaction scenario with both IsPETase\nand IsMHETase (50 nm each). With both enzymes present, the\nWT retains only 4.34 � 0.4 % of the initial substrate (Figure 8B),\nwhile the DM in the presence of MHETase retains 27.9 � 0.5 % of\nthe initial substrate (Figure 8E), suggesting the DM is more\nsusceptible to a slowed rate of hydrolysis with accumulated\nTPA.\nTo distinguish whether the effect of slowed hydrolysis was\ninfluenced by accumulating monomer or the presence of the\nsecond enzyme, we also evaluated how BHET hydrolysis was\ninfluenced by an initial concentration of monomer (1.25 mm\nMHET, TPA, or EG) in addition to the initial substrate concen-\ntration of 2.25 mm BHET. Over 18 h for the WT, BHET hydrolysis\nis slowed in the presence of excess MHET and EG, relative to\nthe reaction containing only BHET. BHET hydrolysis is slightly\nimproved in the presence of excess TPA (Figure 8C). For the\nDM, however, all three product monomers (MHET, TPA, and EG)\nslow the rate of BHET hydrolysis over 18 h (Figure 8F).\nWe subsequently investigated if accumulation of product\nmonomers exhibits a similar effect on conversion of amorphous\nPET film over 96 h, again by initiating reactions in the presence\nof product (1.25 mm BHET, MHET, TPA, or EG) along with the\nPET film (2.9 % by mass or 29 g L\n\u0000 1\n). Reactions containing\n1 mg g\n\u0000 1\nenzyme loading were evaluated for product release,\naccounting for the initial concentration of product monomer\n(Figure 9). For the WT incubated at 30 ° C, product release is\nincreased in the presence of TPA, and slowed by the\naccumulation of MHET and EG over time, relative to reactions\ncontaining only PET film (Figure 9A). For the DM, simulated\naccumulation of MHET had little effect on product release at 30\nor 40 ° C (Figure 9B, C). Simulated accumulation of TPA and EG\nshow reduced product release at 30 and 40 ° C (Figure 9B, C). To\nensure the enzyme is not destabilized in the presence of EG or\nTPA, we also measured the thermal stability of both the WT and\nDM under increasing concentrations of each product.

For example, while\nthe WT enzyme demonstrates high specificity for PET films\nunder ambient conditions, there are limitations in enzyme\nstability (Figure 3). Techno-economic analysis of a modeled\nenzymatic PET recycling process shows that varying temper-\nature (40–80 ° C) imparts no change to process costs.

In particular, it would be interesting to identify if\nPETase has a higher specificity for crystalline PET compared to\nother PET hydrolases, because while some enzymes have\ndemonstrated remarkable hydrolytic activity on amorphized\nPET,\n[1e]\nfar better than any activities reported for PETase or its\nvariants, efficient degradation of highly crystalline substrates\nremains a key opportunity in the development of robust and\ncost-effective enzymatic depolymerization systems.\n[9b]\nTo further explain the differences observed between the WT\nand DM, it seems unlikely that the increased thermal stability of\nthe DM is the primary driver of improved performance, as the\nDM enzyme at 30 ° C shows the poorest performance, despite\nimproved stability. It seems equally unlikely that a possible\nincrease in PET polymer flexibility at 40 ° C is the primary driver\nof improved performance, as the WT at 30 ° C demonstrates\nnearly as good performance as the DM at 40 ° C, still well below\nthe PET T\ng\n. The steady-state kinetic parameters derived from\nthe convMM and invMM models suggest there is an important\ntemperature-dependent change in affinity between the enzyme\nand the substrate at 40 ° C, perhaps indicating that association\nbetween the enzyme and the substrate is better at 40 ° C, but\nthis is true for both enzymes. A temperature-dependent\nimprovement in association between the polyester chain and\nthe enzyme could explain this phenomenon, but whether that\nis due to increased flexibility of the polyester, or a conforma-\ntional change of the enzyme is yet unknown.\nStudy of enzymes with specificity to PET has led to\nimportant discoveries about the catalytic mechanisms\n[4]\nand\nstructural properties of the enzymes. Extending these discov-\neries to facilitate comparative biochemistry requires a balance\nof functional assessment and elucidation of meaningful kinetic\nparameters.\n[14]\nFunctional assessment is critical for process\ndevelopment, uncovering relationships between time-depend-\nence, dose-dependence, and conversion extent. Structure-\nfunction relationships, however, are traditionally studied\nthrough the comparison of kinetic parameters based on initial\nreaction rates. For either methodology of comparison, without\nconsistent reaction conditions, direct comparisons between\nstudies are challenging. In this study, we consider both\napproaches for comparing the WT and DM.\nThe typical model employed for derivation of kinetic\nparameters is based on the conventional MM theory. For\ninterfacial biocatalysts, however, the applicability of this con-\nventional model to reactions taking place at the interface of a\nsolid substrate and aqueous media remains controversial,\n[14]\nspecifically regarding the assumption that substrate be avail-\nable in great excess relative to the enzyme concentration. To\naddress the limited applicability of the conventional MM model\nfor interfacial reactions, an alternative model has been\nproposed that instead looks at reaction regimes with a large\nexcess of available enzyme, coined an “inverse” MM model.\n[14,15]\nThis model has previously been applied to PET-hydrolyzing\nenzymes.\n[15]\nIn contrast to our observations, the previous interfacial\nkinetics study of the PETase DM showed that initial reaction\nrates declined in response to increased enzyme loading in the\ninvMM reaction regime.\n[15]\nA hypothesis was proposed to\nsuggest that “overcrowding” of active and/or denatured\nenzyme at the surface of the substrate, in combination with a\nreduction in the number of available reactive sites due to fast\nturnover of the substrate would lead to this inhibition\nbehavior.\n[15]\nIf limitation in surface accessibility were the primary\ncause, this inhibition behavior would be expected to occur\nmore markedly on substrates with less surface area accessible,\nsuch as films, but that behavior is not apparent in the studies\npresented here.\nWith regard to satisfying the requirements of the conven-\ntional MM model, we selected an enzyme loading consistent\nwith other experiments from this study, which also corresponds\nto the midpoint of the enzyme loadings using for the invMM\nexperiment. This enzyme loading may have been too high to\nsatisfy the requirements of the convMM model. From a\n“concentration” perspective, PET monomers comprising the\nFigure 9. Accumulation of product monomers influences hydrolysis rates of\namorphous PET film. Product accumulation was simulated through the\naddition of 1.25 mm monomer to the reaction mixture along with\namorphous PET film substrate. Aromatic product accumulation over 96 h is\ncompared to reactions containing only the amorphous PET film (gray).\nMonomer accumulation simulation was performed at (A) 30 ° C with the WT,\n(B) 30 ° C with the DM, and (C) 40 ° C with the DM using 1 mg g\n\u0000 1\nenzyme\nloading and 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) loading of the film for all reactions.\nReaction progress is represented by the sum of aromatic products, BHET,\nMHET, and TPA, accounting for the starting concentration of product\nmonomer.

The implications of this\nare that if the enzyme concentration is too high for the\nconvMM dataset, at all solids loadings we observe here, the\nsubstrate is saturated with enzyme, and the requirement that\nsubstrate be in great excess is not met. For reference, the\nprevious study\n[15]\nto look at initial reaction rates for PET\nhydrolysis used 30 nm enzyme loading (relative to 950 nm used\nin this study), but solids loadings up to only 0.6 % (relative to\n11.6 % in this study). While this study uses approximately\n30 times the enzyme concentration of the previous study, it\nalso explores solids loadings of approximately 20 times higher\nas well. Despite the differences in experimental design, we\nobserve a similar k\ncat\nfrom the conventional model (0.52 s\n\u0000 1\nreported by Bååth et al.\n[15]\ncompared to 1.2 s\n\u0000 1\nreported here)\nand a similar\ninv\nV\nmax\n/S\n0\nfrom the inverse model (2.6 nmol s\n\u0000 1\ng\n\u0000 1\nfrom Bååth et al.\n[15]\ncompared to 2.2 nmol s\n\u0000 1\ng\n\u0000 1\nreported here)\nwhen using the same enzyme, same substrate, and same\ntemperature.\nThe kinetic parameters derived from these studies should\nallow one to compare performance of various enzymes,\nespecially with regard to establishing structure-function rela-\ntionships. The potential for performance based on the first\nmoments or hours of a reaction, however, is not always\nreflective of functional performance. Based on the kinetic\nparameters derived from these studies, we would conclude that\nWT-40 ° C is the superior enzyme/temperature combination,\nhowever the WT is less stable at 40 ° C and the lifetime of this\nperformance is limited relative to using the same enzyme at a\nlower temperature. Similarly, employing the DM at 40 ° C, where\nit can maintain stability for longer, also allows for more PET\nconversion using the same amount of enzyme.\nFor any enzymatic process, but certainly for enzymatic\nreactions performed at an industrial scale, loss of catalytic\nperformance due to inhibition can have a significant impact on\nprocess costs. Both the WT and DM enzymes show slowed rates\nof hydrolysis upon accumulation of product monomers. Each\nenzyme has a different inhibition sensitivity profile, which is\nsomewhat unexpected. While we see potentially significant\nimpacts of product inhibition at the small scale, we do not\nknow if the influence is still significant at large scale. It is also an\nopen question if the product accumulation profile and inhib-\nition sensitivity profile might change in a pH-controlled reaction\nrelative to the small-volume closed-system reactions we have\npresented here.\n[16b]"}

Under these\nconditions, significant inhibition of PET turnover activity at high\nenzyme concentration starts to become evident after approx-\nimately 1 h of incubation (Figure S3); the degree of inhibition\nrises above 50 % after 2 h and is sustained at a high level\nthroughout the remainder of the 4-day time-course (Figure 2C).\nDuring this period, the greatest degree of PET hydrolysis is\nwitnessed for 50–100 nm IsPETase, with an enzyme loading of\n2.75–5.51 μg cm\n\u0000 2\n. This enzyme concentration-dependent inhib-\nition is even more pronounced in the fusion of IsMHETase, an\nenzyme that hydrolyses MHET in I. sakaiensis,\n[2]\nand IsPETase.\n[24]\nThis enzyme fusion exhibits 99 � 0.1 % inhibition at pH 8.0\n(Figure S4). This acute susceptibility of IsPETase to concentra-\ntion-dependent inhibition is evident for the individual aromatic\nproducts TPA and MHET and is stronger at 30 ° C than 40 ° C\n(Figure S5). Consistent with an earlier report,\n[2]\nthe inhibition of\nMHET production at high enzyme concentration appears to be\nmore pronounced than for TPA. Although MHETase activity was\ninitially reported to be absent in IsPETase,\n[2]\nit has been\nsubsequently observed during extended incubations.\n[25]\nHere,\nwe measured detectable MHETase activity with 100 nm IsPE-\nTase, albeit at a rate approximately 280-times lower than for\nBHET hydrolysis (Figure S6). Moreover, the MHETase activity\nincreases with the IsPETase concentration, confirming that the\nhydrolysis is enzymatic rather than spontaneous (Figure S6).\nThe marked decline in observed MHET production is thus a\nconsequence of both the inhibition of PET hydrolysis at high\nenzyme concentration and this intrinsic MHETase activity in\nIsPETase.\nInhibition of PET hydrolysis at high IsPETase concentration is\na surface phenomenon\nThe observed concentration-dependent inhibition could poten-\ntially arise from aggregation of the enzyme in solution. To\ninvestigate this possibility, we analyzed the behavior of IsPETase\nin solution by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig-\nure S7). Across all concentrations tested (5 to 50 μM), IsPETase\neluted as a single, narrow peak without any change in elution\nvolume (and, hence, apparent MW), suggesting a consistent\nmonomeric state. Furthermore, the rate of BHET hydrolysis does\nnot decline at elevated IsPETase concentrations, as would be\nexpected if the enzyme were aggregating in solution (Fig-\nure S8), so we conclude that the concentration-dependent\ninhibition is a surface phenomenon produced when enzyme\nmolecules interact with each other following substrate binding.\nEnzyme concentration-dependent inhibition is dependent on\nsubstrate surface area\nTo gain further insight into inhibition at high enzyme concen-\ntrations in IsPETase, we analyzed the dependence of PET\nhydrolysis activity on substrate surface area by varying the\namorphous PET film solids loading. Iteratively doubling the\nsolids loading from 2.1 wt % to 16.8 wt % (and, hence, iteratively\nhalving the enzyme loading per surface area) resulted in a\nreduction in the inhibition (Figure 3A) with a concomitant\nincrease of the enzyme concentration at which inhibition\noccurs. This shift in inhibitory enzyme concentration is consis-\ntent with the relief of inhibitory enzyme–enzyme interactions at\nthe PET surface as enzyme density falls due to a reduced\nenzyme loading per surface area. In contrast, increasing the\nenzyme concentration in proportion to the PET loading\nstrengthens the inhibition (Figure 3B)."}

These enzymes have at least one order of magnitude\nlower PET-degrading activity than IsPETase, with RgCut-II\nexhibiting the highest activity among the homologues (Fig-\nure 5A). Each of these enzymes presented varying levels of\nconcentration-dependent inhibition under their optimal solu-\ntion conditions, with the exception of RgCut-II (Figure 5B,\nFigure S11), despite this enzyme belonging to the same type IIb\ngroup as IsPETase. There is no clear relationship between the\nextent of inhibition at high concentration and the phylogenetic\ngrouping of the enzymes.\nIn addition, there is no correlation between the levels of PET\nhydrolysis and inhibition, suggesting that the phenomenon is\nnot related to catalytic competence. With the exception of\nSbCut and RgCut-I, DMSO significantly increased the activity of\nthe homologous enzymes, as observed with IsPETase (Figure 5A,\nFigure S12). Any relief of concentration-dependent inhibition\noffered by DMSO is also protein-dependent (Figure S13);\nreduction is seen for PaCut, SbCut, AdCut, and RgCut-I, but not\nfor PsCut, PbauzCut or PoCut.\nIn search of a structural basis\nThe variable susceptibilities of the type II enzymes to concen-\ntration-dependent inhibition suggests that this phenomenon\ncould relate to enzyme structure and/or stability. Both exper-\nimental and computational structure models of these proteins\nwere analyzed to look for protein characteristics associated with\nthe inhibitory behavior. To this end, we solved the crystal\nstructures of three enzymes – RgCut-II, PsCut and PbauzCut – to\nhigh resolution (Table S5). As expected, the structures were\nhighly similar, with each conforming to the consensus α/β-\nhydrolase fold (Figure S14). However, structural features such as\nthe width of the active site cleft (Figure S15) and the\ndistribution of surface electrostatic charges (Figure S16) show\nno discernible correlation with the degree of concentration-\ndependent inhibition.\nWe next investigated the thermostability of the enzymes by\nmeasuring apparent melting temperature (T\nm\n) values by differ-\nential scanning calorimetry (DSC). These mostly fell in the range\nof 48 to 52 ° C (Table S6) with the exception of RgCut-II which\nhas an apparent T\nm\nof approximately 67 ° C; this higher thermo-\nstability may reflect enhanced structural rigidity to the enzyme.\nThe multiple sequence alignment of the RgCut-II with the\nselected enzymes (Figure S17) reveals that RgCut-II has a shorter\nloop between β8 and α6 – the length of which differentiates\ntype II enzymes from type I – and which has been proposed to\ncontribute in part to the binding of PET substrate.\n[4]\nTo\ndetermine whether this loop influences the susceptibility to\nconcentration-dependent inhibition, we constructed two mu-\ntants of IsPETase and RgCut-II in which the loop sequences\n(Ser242-Gly243-Asn244-Ser245-Asn246-Gln247-Ala248 and\nAsn234-Ala235-Asn236-Pro237, respectively) were inter-\nchanged.

However, DSC analyses indicated that\nthe IsPETase\nRg\n(IsPETase with RgCut-II loop) and RgCut-II\nIs\n(RgCut-II with IsPETase loop) variants were destabilized with\nrespect to their wild-type counterparts by 4.4 and 7.5 ° C,\nrespectively (Table S6).

In addition, only a small increase in\ninhibition was found with the RgCut-II\nIs\nmutant (Figure S18)\nwith a concomitant loss in activity. These results imply that\nthere is no substantial effect of the extended β8-α6 loop on the\nsusceptibility of IsPETase to concentration-dependent inhib-\nition.\nWe undertook a detailed comparison of RgCut-II and\nIsPETase, with a particular focus on internal structural details.\nWe note that IsPETase has several previously unappreciated\ninternal cavities that may influence in the rigidity of the active\nsite of the enzyme allowing residues mobilities (Figure 6).\nAdjacent to the active site of IsPETase, as well as all the\nanalyzed mesophilic enzymes, a cavity exists between Ala240\nand Ile250 that is substantially filled in RgCut-II by the bulkier\nresidues phenylalanine (Phe232) and valine (Val239; Figure 6).\nFilling this cavity could reduce flexibility of the active site.\nTo test this hypothesis, we made the RgCut-II F232A/V239I\nvariant and investigated its susceptibility to inhibition at high\nconcentration (Figure 6C). This variant exhibited a similar\nmelting temperature to the wild-type RgCut-II enzyme (Ta-\nble S6). Although modest, an increase in concentration-depend-\nent inhibition from 0 to 31 % at 40 ° C was found, suggesting an\ninverse relationship between active site rigidity and inhibition\nsusceptibility.\nConcentration-dependent inhibition can be reduced by\nenzyme engineering\nIt has been noted that the residues that surround the IsPETase\nactive site differ from those of thermotolerant PET hydrolases.\n[4]\nIn prior work, it was shown that interchanging two residues at\nthe active site (W159H/S238F)\n[30]\nenhances the melting temper-\nature of IsPETase by 10 ° C, and its activity at elevated\ntemperatures.\n[16]\nHere, we found that this double mutant also\nshows reduced susceptibility to inhibition at high concentration\ncompared to the wild-type enzyme at both pH 8.0 and pH 9.0\n(Figure 7). It is noteworthy that the residue Ser238 variation to\nphenylalanine or tyrosine is common amongst the type II\nenzymes (Figure S17, Figure S19), including RgCut-II (Phe230),\nwith no evident effect on inhibition, suggesting that the double\nmutant needs both substitutions to affect its increased thermal\nstability and reduced susceptibility to inhibition. From a\nstructural point of view, this combination of mutations may\nstabilize the loop structure where the active site histidine\n(His237) is located, reducing its flexibility.\nInhibition is eliminated in HotPETase\nSince, for the IsPETase W159H/S238F variant, a gain in thermo-\nstability accompanies a decrease in concentration-dependent\ninhibition, we investigated the phenomenon in two other,\npreviously reported, thermostable variants, IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/\nR280A[31]\nand HotPETase.\n[3]\nThe latter has multiple mutations and\nexhibits a dramatic increase in thermostability with an apparent\nT\nm\nof 83.8 ° C under our measurement conditions (Table S6) and\nan optimal activity temperature of 65 ° C. However, HotPETase\nhas the unusual property of maintaining the same activity as\nthe wild-type enzyme at lower temperature\n[3]\nwhich allows for\ncomparison of any concentration-dependent inhibition under\nthe same conditions. Compared to the wild-type IsPETase, the\ninhibition in IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A\nis greatly reduced at 30 ° C\n(Figure 8A), minimal at 40 ° C (Figure S20A), and abolished at\n50 ° C (Figure S20B), although PET hydrolysis activity is drastically\nlower at this highest temperature. Similarly, concentration-\ndependent inhibition is totally absent in HotPETase at 30 ° C\n(Figure 8A), corroborating the observation that increased\nthermostability is often correlated with reduced inhibition.\nAnalysis of the HotPETase structure indicates that the number\nof cavities is reduced in this enzyme including in the region of\nthe active site (Figure S21). Finally, comparative molecular\ndynamics simulations of wild-type IsPETase and HotPETase\nreveal that HotPETase has significantly less flexibility in the\nvicinity of the active site (Figure 8B, Figure S22), further\nsupporting the association of concentration-dependent inhib-\nition with active site flexibility.\nFigure 6.

In such interfacial catalysis, the reaction rate is hyperbolic\nwith respect to enzyme concentration, due to the saturation of\naccessible scissile bonds on the substrate.\n[15,17]\nIn contrast to\nthis, here we have shown that for IsPETase and numerous\nmesophilic homologues, the extent of reaction is not hyperbolic\nin profile; instead, it reaches a maximum then falls as the\nenzyme concentration rises.\n[2,15,20]\nIn this study, we analyzed concentration-dependent inhib-\nition in multiple natural IsPETase homologues and engineered\nvariants of IsPETase itself, and we demonstrated that the extent\nof inhibition on PET is related to the dynamic properties of the\nenzyme, including regions around the active site; less thermo-\nstable enzymes are often more susceptible to inhibition at high\nenzyme concentration. For each enzyme, the extent of inhib-\nition depends on temperature, solution conditions (pH and the\nconcentration of DMSO), and substrate surface area. The\ninfluence of these parameters can explain the different results\nobtained previously for the enzyme concentration dependence\nof IsPETase in different studies.\n[2,16,20]\nHowever, a molecular\nexplanation for these observations is beyond the scope of this\nwork; it will require future developments in our collective\nunderstanding of enzymatic properties at the solid-liquid inter-\nface and how these influence PET depolymerization perform-\nance.\nA previous study of the surface adsorption to PET particles\nby PET-degrading enzymes including IsPETase, showed a strong\nadsorption\n[32]\n(with a K\nd\nfor IsPETase of 22 nm), with a\nconcomitant formation of an enzyme monolayer when the\nsubstrate surface is saturated. In our study, concentration-\ndependent inhibition occurs at concentrations above 50–\n100 nm enzyme with the PET films. Given the dimensions of our\nstadium-shaped PET film coupons (13 × 3 × 0.25 mm), and a\ncalculated footprint of IsPETase on PET particles (9 nm\n2\n),\n[32]\nwe\ncan estimate a maximal surface coverage of 1.42 nmol g\n\u0000 1\nPET,\nequivalent to around 15 pmol per film piece. With these\nparameters, the mole fraction of bound enzyme at maximal\nactivity, calculated as described previously,\n[32]\ncould be esti-\nmated to 0.23 with an occupancy of 11.7 pmol per film piece at\n100 nm, close to the monolayer limit of 15. This occupancy\nvalue indicates a high coverage for IsPETase on the film for the\nenzyme concentrations at which inhibition is evident.\nThe fact that concentration-dependent inhibition is wit-\nnessed on PET film but not on PET powder (of an equivalent\nmass) is an argument against the possibility of aggregation-\nmediated enzyme inactivation in bulk solution or a reduction in\navailable substrate scissile bonds by enzyme hydrolysis. More-\nover, the appearance of concentration-dependent inhibition at\nhigh enzyme coverage is consistent with an inhibitory surface\ncrowding effect as described previously.\n[15,16]\nUnder crowding\nconditions, lateral enzyme–enzyme interactions could poten-\ntially interfere with enzyme-substrate binding. For example,\nthey may change the enzyme orientation with respect to the\nplastic surface leading to binding at unproductive sites on the\nenzyme. Alternatively, crowding could elicit conformational\nchanges in the enzyme exposing unproductive binding sites\nresulting in surface capture of enzyme molecules in inactive\norientations. In support of this, overshooting adsorption –\nwhere adherence to a hydrophobic surface is enhanced\ncompared to the simple adsorption-desorption Langmuir model\n– has been associated with a high bulk protein concentration,\nand explained by an alteration, over time, in the orientation of\nprotein absorbed on the surface.\n[33]"}

Similarly, DMSO may relieve inhibitory\nenzyme–enzyme hydrophobic interactions at the plastic surface.\nIn fact, DMSO can change several properties of proteins\nincluding their binding capacity.\n[34]\nFurthermore, the effect of\nDMSO is known to be protein-dependent\n[35]\nexplaining its varied\ninfluence on activity and enzyme concentration-dependent\ninhibition among the studied mesophilic enzymes.\nAlthough not apparent with the first 30 min of incubation,\nthe inhibition accumulates rapidly during the following few\nhours. This temporal dependence could be explained by a time-\ndependent accumulation of non-productively bound enzyme,\nas described in the above overshooting absorption kinetic\nmodel.\n[33]\nIn addition, the lack of concentration-dependent\ninhibition during the initial incubation phase could be due to\nthe early release of PET fragments (soluble or insoluble) by\nendo-type cleavage\n[36,37]\nwhich may recruit and sequester\nenzyme molecules thus decreasing the initial rate of surface\ndeposition. Whilst it is possible that the product inhibition that\nhas been reported for other PET degrading enzymes\n[8]\ncould\nplay a role in concentration-dependent inhibition, this seems\nunlikely as the phenomenon is evident well before significant\nconcentrations of any monomeric products can accumulate.\nIt is conceivable that crowding-induced changes in enzyme\nconformation – and, hence, a reduction in PET degrading\nactivity – would be exacerbated for enzymes of lower structural\nrigidity. Indeed, previous molecular dynamic simulations re-\nvealed greater mobility in the active site of IsPETase than\nthermophilic enzymes like LCC and TfCut2;\n[38]\nin general, unlike\nIsPETase, such thermophilic enzymes do not exhibit concen-\ntration-dependent inhibition at their optimal temperatures.\n[15]\nThis contrast in behaviors could arise both from differences in\nenzyme biophysical properties, and from differential substrate\naccessibility at the enzymes’ optimal temperatures. However,\nthe contribution of the latter factor might seem less important\nbecause those surface polymer chains in the vicinity of the bulk\nsolvent (and, hence, most susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis)\nalready have a considerably lower glass transition temperature\n(T\ng\n= 40–48 ° C) compared to those buried within the bulk\nmaterial (T\ng\n= 65–71 ° C);\n[8,37]\nthis difference is due to an intrinsi-\ncally lower degree of order near the polymer surface, com-\npounded by plasticization due to water ingress.\n[8]\nHowever, the\nobserved alleviation of IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A\nconcentration-\nChemSusChem\nResearch Article\ndoi.org/10.1002/cssc.202202277\nChemSusChem 2023, 16, e202202277 (8 of 12) © 2023 The Authors.

This is likely\nreflective of a diminished active site flexibility associated with\nthe increased thermal tolerance, which is supported by a\nreduction in the size of a cavity near the catalytic site. In\naddition, the mutants of IsPETase, W159H/S238F and S121E/\nD186H/R280 A, which have around a 10 ° C higher apparent T\nm\nthan the wild-type enzyme, exhibit substantially reduced\ninhibition compared to the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, concen-\ntration-dependent inhibition is absent in the thermostable\nmutant HotPETase which has a less flexible active site than\nwild-type IsPETase."}

Increased thermosta-\nbilityisthereforeadvantageousforthe IsPETase-catalyzed\ndegradation of PET. A good example in this study is the\ncomparison of the TM and TM1 variants. In the degrada-\ntionofPETnanoparticles,theTMvariantshowedahigher\ntotal product formation at 40◦C than TM1.

There, this variant showed an\napproximately two-fold increase in relative activity com-\nparedtoTM(Table S4).SinceTMonlyhasaT m of56.5◦C,\nit is highly probable that this variant is inactivated much\nfasterovertheperiodof72hthanTM1andthereforeless\nproductwasreleased(Figure 4).\nFor variants containing the K95N and F201I substitu-\ntions, low activities for hydrolysis of PET nanoparticles\nwereobserved.TheaminoacidF201islocatedinadeeply\nhiddenhydrophobiccoreof IsPETase,whichadditionally\nconsistsofpositionsW97,L101,M157,L199,L230,W257and\nM258 [37].

This is consistent with the observations\nby Yoshida et al. who also showed that MHET was the\nmajor product forIsPETase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PET\n[18]. According to Yoshida et al., degradation of MHET\nby IsPETase should not be possible [18]. However, in the\ndegradationofamorphousPETfilm,TAisthemainprod-\nuct, since MHET is degraded byIsPETase with extended\nincubation time. The same reaction has already been\ndescribed elsewhere [46]. A prolonged incubation of the\nPETathightemperaturescanleadtoaslowtransformation\nof mobile amorphous fractions to rigid amorphous frac-\ntions, which are less degradable by the enzyme [16]. This\nprocessiscalledphysicalagingandcanthereforebecon-\nsideredasacompetitivereactiontotheenzymaticdegrada-\ntionoftheamorphousPET[ 16].SinceanamorphousPET\nfilmhasmuchlessaccessiblesurfaceareaandmuchlonger\npolymer chains compared to the PET nanoparticles [47],\nIsPETase and its variants, which cannot take part in the\neffective degradation of the polymers, will be more likely\nto degrade the MHET.

Higher thermostability could\nalso be achieved by combination of four stabilizing sub-\nstitutions with already promising published variants. For\nthe effective degradation of PET by enzymes, the right\nbalance between hydrolytic activity and thermostability\nis essential. As demonstrated with IsPETase variants\ncontaining the K95N and F201I substitutions, even a\nslightlynegativeinfluenceofamutationontheactivityof\nPET hydrolysis can be compensated by the simultaneous\nincrease ofTm for degradation reaction at higher incuba-\ntiontemperatures.Thisledtoanimprovedeffectivenessin\nPET degradation by theseIsPETase variants.

Although side-by-side\ncomparisons of selected enzymes can address this\nissue (Arnal et al., 2023; Norton-Baker et al., 2024),\nthis approach is impractical for the 99 enzymes identi-\nfied in PANDA.

(b) Structure similarity matrix based on LDDT\nscores (Mariani et al.,2013), calculated using Foldseek (van Kempen et al.,2024). To reduce variability, Alphafold2 predictions (Jumper\net al.,2021) were used for all PETases in the dataset even when experimental structures were available. Black squares correspond to Clusters\n1, 2, and 3 from the SSN analysis (Figure1).

This might not always be\ntrue; for example, a slower but more stable enzyme\nmight outperform a faster enzyme in a long reaction but\nnot in a shorter one (Bell et al.,\n2022). Substrate vari-\nability could have the same effect, as some enzymes\nhave higher specificity toward PET film over PET pow-\nder or vice versa (Erickson et al.,2022). The extent to\nwhich such variability affects cross-experiment compar-\nisons is still unknown.\nTo assess the robustness of enzyme rankings\nacross variable experimental setups, we analyzed data\nby Erickson et al. (2022), where a set of 19 enzymes\nwere tested in different conditions. We ranked the\nenzymes in each condition and analyzed how the rank-\nings correlate using the Kendall Tau coefficient\n(Kendall,\n1938). Despite the variability in substrate and\nreaction duration, even the lowest observed correlation\n(Kendall-τ = 0.47) indicated a reasonable likelihood\n(73.5%, given by the formula p ¼τþ1\n2 ) of consistent\nrankings across experiments, enabling approximate\ncomparisons of PETase activity (Supplementary\nFigure 3). A detailed explanation of the analysis is\navailable in Supplementary Text4.\nTo identify promising enzymes from PANDA using\ncomparative rankings, a set of highly active enzymes\nserving as references must be defined. We analyzed\nresults from another experiment by Erickson et al.\n(\n2022), where 38 PETases were tested at their optimal\ntemperature and pH. We classified the 11 top perform-\ning as “highly active” (top /C24 30%). Then, we searched\nthe rest of PANDA (61/99 enzymes) for enzymes tested\nagainst one of the 11 references when both were\ntested in their optimal conditions. Nine additional\nenzymes performed comparably or better. All 20“highly\nactive” enzymes (20.2% of the enzymes in the dataset)\nare shown in Figure\n2, with their thermostability repre-\nsented by color: thermophilic enzymes (optimal temper-\nature ≥50\n/C14 C) are shown in red, and mesophilic\nenzymes (optimal temperature ≤40/C14 C) are shown in\nblue. Supplementary Table4 contains names and ther-\nmostability classification of the highly active enzymes.\nThe visualization of the function in the phylogenetic tree\nof Figure2 shows that evolutionary origin and PETase\nhigh activity do not strictly correlate, suggesting that\nsequence information alone cannot be used to identify\npromising candidates and that highly active PETases\nmay reside in less explored clades, as recently shown\nby Seo et al.

In this section, we review the current state of\nPETase engineering, distinguishing between: (1) degra-\ndation in mesophilic conditions — dominated by the\nengineered variants of IsPETase — which provide\nthe opportunity to integrate living cells into the recycling\nprocess, and (2) degradation in thermophilic\nconditions— dominated by the engineered variants of\nLCC— allowing PET recycling using pure enzymes and\nhigh temperatures.

Hit-\nsequences with a bit score higher than 100 were\nselected for further filtering. The filtering was implemen-\nted by excluding duplicates and highly similar\nsequences as well as sequences that did not include a\ncanonical catalytic triad with Ser-His-Asp. Additionally,\nhits with more diverse bacterial origins in comparison to\nexisting affiliations were chosen. Finally, 20 target pro-\nteins were selected for further analysis.\n4.2 | Molecular cloning and target\nprotein production inE. coliMC1061\nThe corresponding target genes were truncated if\nN-terminal signal sequences were present. These\nsequences were identified by SignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,\n2022). Molecular cloning was performed with the\nfragment-exchange (FX)-cloning methodology, whereby\nthe truncated target genes were extended with recogni-\ntion sites for the restriction enzymeSapI using the FX-\ncloning tool (\nhttps://www.fxcloning.org/) (Geertsma &\nDutzler, 2011). This cloning methodology leads to a sin-\ngle amino acid overhang on each end (N-terminal serine\nand C-terminal alanine) of the final gene product. Finally,\nall target genes were codon-optimized for heterologous\nexpression in E. coli MC1061. The target genes were\ncloned into the plasmid vectors p1 (Geertsma & Dutzler,\n2011), p2, p3, or p12 (Bjerga et al.,2016), leading to the\nattachment of an N-10xHis-, N-10xHis-Maltose-binding-\nprotein (MBP)-, N-10xHis-Small Ubiquitin-related MOdi-\nfier (SUMO)- or C-6xHis-tag, respectively, to the final\nprotein. The positive control, LCC\nICCG, was cloned into\np12, and the negative control, namely a linker sequence\nof GSGSGS, was cloned into each vector. Successful\ncloning was tested by colony PCR and subsequent aga-\nrose gel electrophoresis. Finally, genes were verified by\nsequencing if the corresponding target protein showed\nhydrolytic activity towards PET. Sequencing was also\nperformed for every negative and the positive control.\nFor heterologous gene expression in E. coli\nMC1061, chemically competent bacteria were trans-\nformed with the plasmid constructs. A pre-culture with\n3 mL LB and 100μg/mL ampicillin was prepared by\ninoculation and subsequent incubation at 37\n/C14 C, over-\nnight and 180 rpm. Next, 20 mL 2YT medium with\n100 μg/mL ampicillin in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask\n(main culture) was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the pre-\nculture and incubated at 140 rpm, 37\n/C14 C for 2 to 3 h until\nan OD600 /C24 0.6. Then, the main cultures were trans-\nferred to 18/C14 C and gene expression was induced by\nadding 100 μL of a 20% (w/v) L-arabinose stock-\nsolution for a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). After\n20 h, cultures were placed on ice, decanted into pre-\ncooled 50 mL tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 4\n/C14 C\nand 3000/C2 g. Next, cell pellets were resuspended in\n10 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 mM\nimidazole. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and\nthe lysates centrifuged for 30 min at 4\n/C14 C and 3000/C2 g.\nThe cleared cell lysate was used for further purification.\n4.3 | Target protein purification by Ni-\nimmobilized metal affinity chromatography\n(Ni-IMAC)\nThe soluble fractions of the poly-His-tagged target pro-\nteins were subjected to a Ni-NTA column purification\nusing a HisPur™ Ni-NTA Spin Purification Kit (0.2 mL,\nThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s proto-\ncol. Finally, three 200 μL elution fractions were col-\nlected and stored at 4/C14 C for a maximum of 2 days.\n4.4 | Functional screening on substrate\nsupplemented agar plates\nThe production of agar plates supplemented with\nrespective substrates was adapted from Pérez-García\n10 of 15 TURAK ET AL.\n\net al. (2021). PBS agar was prepared with 0.1 M PBS\nand 1.5% (w/v) agar, sterilized by autoclaving, and\nallowed to cool down to ca. 60/C14 C until substrate solu-\ntions were added. 20 mL of substrate PBS agar was\ndispensed into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify\nunder sterile conditions.\n4.5 | Production of PET nanoparticle\n(PET-NP) suspension and agar-plates\nA stock PET-NP suspension was prepared by dissol-\nving 0.1 g thin pieces of a PET film (Goodfellow) in\n10 mL 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaf luoro-2-propanol (HFIP,\nSigma-Aldrich) in a separatory funnel in the fume\nhood. The solution was dropped slowly into 100 mL\npre-cooled and deionized water in a glass beaker\nunder vigorous mixing with an Ultra-Turrax ™ T25\nbasic (IKA Labortechnik). Residual HFIP was allowed\nto evaporate for several days. The suspension\n(ca. 0.3 mg/mL) was added to 200 mL molten PBS-\nagar. In all PET-NP suspension preparations, precipi-\ntation of PET was observed, which potentially\ndecreased the final concentration of PET-NPs after\nfiltration in the agar plates. Agar plates with sufficient\nturbidity after visual inspection were used for further\nexperiments.\n4.6 | Production of BHET solution and\nagar-plates\nA 1 M stock solution of Bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n(BHET, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in DMSO. BHET-\ncontaining PBS-agar plates were prepared with a final\nconcentration of 0.5 M BHET.\n4.7 | Production of PCL solution and\nagar-plates\n0.25 g of PCL granules (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved\nin 15 mL acetone at 60/C14 C. This solution was transferred\ninto 500 mL of PBS-agar.\n4.8 | Functional screening of target\nproteins\nTwenty microliters of Ni-NTA purified target protein was\nspotted onto PCL, BHET, or PET-NP supplemented\nPBS-agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30\n/C14 C\nfor 7 days. Enzymatic hydrolysis activity was detected\nby the formation of zones of clearance (halos), which\nbecame visible due to the decrease of turbidity on the\nplate.\n4.9 | Heterologous expression and\npurification ofHaloPETase1 and single\nmutants thereof\nThe codon-optimized gene sequence (without\nN-terminal signal peptide) ofHaloPETase1 (GenBank\nID: MAB42154.1) was cloned into the p3 vector, which\nleads to a protein with N-10xHis-SUMO-tag upon\nexpression. Chemically competent E. coli Shuffle® T7\n(NEB) were transformed with the respective construct\nand cultivated on LB-agar plates with 100μg/mL ampi-\ncillin. A pre-culture was prepared in LB with 100μg/mL\nampicillin by cultivation overnight at 37/C14 C and 180 rpm.\nA 2 L culture with TB medium and 100μg/mL ampicillin\nin a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with 1% (v/v)\nof the pre-culture and grown until an OD\n600 of /C24 0.6 at\n37/C14 C and 140 rpm. The culture was placed at 18/C14 C and\ngene expression induced by adding 0.2% (v/v) from a\n20% (w/v) L-Arabinose stock. Bacteria were harvested\nafter 20 h by centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed\nin 20 mL PBS and subsequently frozen at/C0 20\n/C14 C until\nfurther use.\nFor purification, the cell pellets were thawed on ice\nand resuspended in 40 mL of cold buffer A (50 mM\nNaP\ni, 50 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells\nwere lysed by sonication, and the supernatant collected\nafter centrifugation was subjected to a Ni-IMAC with a\n5 mL HisTrap\n® FF column (Cytiva) attached to an\nÄKTA pure™ (Cytiva) purification system. Elution was\nperformed by an imidazole gradient with buffer B\n(50 mM NaPi, 500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl,\npH 7.4) ranging from 0 to 50% over 20 CV.\nTo cleave the N-10xHis-SUMO-tag from the target\nprotein, 2 mg of SUMO-tag protease SenP2 was added\nto approx. 40 mg protein (1:20 mass ratio) in the pooled\nNi-IMAC fractions. The protein was dialyzed overnight\nat 4\n/C14 C against buffer C (20 mM NaPi, 150 mM NaCl,\npH 7.4) to remove imidazole and then further purified\nby reverse Ni-IMAC. Finally, the target protein was fur-\nther purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)\nusing a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 75 pg. column\nattached to an ÄKTA pure™ (Cytiva) purification sys-\ntem. SEC fractions were pooled, and the protein was\nconcentrated to 10 to 50 mg/mL. 25 to 50μL samples\nwere flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at/C0 20\n/C14 C\nuntil further use.\n4.10 | PET-degradation endpoint and\nkinetic measurements in PET-coated well\nplates and soluble product analysis\n96-well plates (Thermo Scientific™ Nunc MicroWell™\nflat bottom) were coated with a PET-film according to\nWeigert et al. (\n2021)5 0μL of an enzyme solution was\nadded per well, and the plates were sealed with a gas-\nTURAK ET AL. 11 of 15\n\ntight self-adhesive film. In general, plates with enzyme\nsolutions were incubated at the target temperature for\n20 h. Subsequently, all samples were prepared and\nanalyzed via reverse-phase UHPLC as described in\nWeigert et al. (\n2021).\nKinetic analysis was performed with 70μL enzyme\nsolution per well. To analyze the total product releases\nat specific time points, 50μL solution was transferred to\na non-coated 96-well plate. This plate was then trans-\nferred to/C0 20\n/C14 C to quench the reaction. Reverse-phase\nUHPLC analysis was performed as before.\n4.11 | pNPB-activity measurement for\nthermostability assessment of\nHaloPETase1\n500 nM of HaloPETase1 were incubated in 1 mL\n20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, with 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl concentra-\ntion at 50, 60, or 68/C14 C for up to 72 h. 10μL samples\nwere taken after 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h from each salt\nand temperature condition and diluted with 980 μL\n20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl in a UV-\ntransmissible plastic cuvette. To begin the hydrolytic\nreaction, 10 μL of a 100 mM pNPB in DMSO were\ntransferred to the enzyme solution in the cuvette. The\nreaction was mixed by inversion, and kinetic absor-\nbance measurement was performed at 405 nm immedi-\nately after mixing. The residual activity was determined\nby normalizing the initial rates with the one at 0 h\nincubation.\n4.12 | Heterologous expression and\npurification ofHaloPETases2 to 6\nThe genes ofHaloPETases2 to 6 were analyzed with\nSignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,2022) to identify and remove\nthe N-terminal signal peptide. Genes were codon-\noptimized for production in E. coli Shuffle\n® T7 cells\n(NEB) and cloned into the pET21b-vector. Pre-cultures\nwere prepared as before. The expression was then\ninduced by the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG (final concen-\ntration) and cultures were left overnight at 16 or 20\n/C14 C\nwith 140 rpm shaking. Cells were harvested, and pel-\nlets were washed with 30 mL PBS.\nCells were thawed on ice, resuspended with 30 mL of\nbuffer A, and subsequently lysed via ultrasonication.\nCrude cell lysates were centrifuged to separate cell debris\nfrom soluble protein at 4\n/C14 C, 18,000 rpm for 1 h. The\ncleared lysates (supernatants) were transferred into a\nfresh vessel and stored on ice. Ni-NTA and SEC purifica-\ntion steps were performed for all proteins. If insufficient\npurity was observed by SDS-PAGE, ion-exchange chro-\nmatography was performed as a final step.\nIf so, fractions from the SEC were pooled and concen-\ntrated to dilute the NaCl concentration 20-fold from 150 to\ntheoretically 7.5 mM with buffer D (20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4).\nCation- and anion-exchange chromatography was per-\nformed with a 1 mL HiTrap\n® SP FF or 1 mL HiTrap® Q\nFF column, respectively. The elution was performed by a\nlinear gradient from 0 to 25% of buffer E (20 mM NaPi,\n2 M NaCl, pH 7.4) over 20 CV. The peak fractions were\npooled, concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen.\n4.13 | Site-directed mutagenesis of\nHaloPETase1\nSingle mutations were introduced inHaloPETase1 at\nposition T88 to re-establish theπ-stacking clamp and at\nposition Q157 to re-introduce the canonical methionine\nin the lipase-box motif using site-directed mutagenesis.\nSee Table\nS5 for primer pairs and sequences.\nSequences were verified by Sanger sequencing.\n4.14 | Bioinformatic mining for putative\nPETases inHalopseudomonas\nA search was conducted against the proteome ofHalop-\nseudomonas. For this, 40 genomes were retrieved from\nNCBI (for accession numbers see Table S4). Open\nreading frames of theHalopseudomonas genomes were\npredicted with Prodigal version 2.6.3 (Hyatt et al.,2010).\nA hidden Markov model profile from biochemically char-\nacterized PETases from the PAZy database (Buchholz\net al.,\n2022) was generated with HMMER version 3.1b1\n(Eddy, 1998) using thehmmbuild option, and a search\nagainst theHalopseudomonas proteome was performed\nusing HMMER 3.1b1 with thehmmsearch option and a\nbitscore threshold of 100.\n4.15 | Three-dimensional structure\ndetermination\nHaloPETase1 in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5\nwas set to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Sitting-\ndrop vapor-diffusion methodology was used with JCSG\nCore I-III and PEGs II (Qiagen) for screening crystalli-\nzation conditions in 96 well Intelli plates (Art Robbins)\nstored at 20\n/C14 C in Rock Imager RI 182 (Formulatrix).\nVolume ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 were prepared using\na Phoenix robot dispenser (Art Robbins Instruments)\nwith a total drop volume of 0.8μL. Crystal formation\nwas observed in the following condition: 1:1 ratio, 0.1 M\nimidazole, 40% (v/v) PEG 400. For cryoprotection, 25%\n(v/v) glycerol was added to the crystals before flash-\nfreezing in liquid nitrogen.

These proteins were recombinantly pro-\nduced in E. coli. Subsequently, purified proteins were\nspotted onto PBS-agar plates supplemented with either\nBHET, PET-NP, or PCL to characterize their enzymatic\nactivity towards these substrates.\nWe observed the formation of zones of clearances\n(halos) for 14 target proteins towards all substrates\n(Figure\nS1 and TableS1). Three hits, PSW62-1,Halo-\nPETase1, and ASW29-1, indicated halos on PET-\nplates after 7 days of incubation at 30/C14 C. We ana-\nlyzed their affiliation and identified the origin of their\ngene sequences in metagenomes associated with\nPseudomonas sp. According to a BLASTp search in\nnon-redundant protein databases, PSW62-1 and\nASW29-1 have a sequence identity of 89.2% with the\nPET-active polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from Halop-\nseudomonas aestusnigri (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, &\nJaeger, 2020). In the case of HaloPETase1, a cuti-\nnase from Pseudomonas mendocina (PmC) was the\nclosest related and characterized PETase (Ronkvist\net al., 2009) until later on, Chen et al. (2024) pub-\nlished dsPETase05, a salt-tolerant PETase from the\nNorth Su hydrothermal vent (Chen et al.,\n2024)t h a t\nshares over 98% sequence identity with HaloPE-\nTase1. Due to sequence identities of 62.4% withPmC\nand sequence identities of <34% to PETases from\ntype I and II (see TableS2), we concluded thatHalo-\nPETase1 is a promising candidate for the extension\nof the narrow sequence space of currently known\nPETases.\n2.2 | Quantification and optimization of\nPET-degradation byHaloPETase1\nHaloPETase1 was produced and tested in the func-\ntional agar screening with an N-10xHis-SUMO-tag. For\nsubsequent experiments, the tag was removed from\nthe enzyme during purification (see also Figure\nS2 for\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel). We investigated the PET\ndegradation (Figure1) conditions byHaloPETase1 first\nusing PET-coated well-plates (Weigert et al.,2021) and\nthen using in solution immersed PET films to assess\nthe potential of this enzyme.\nHaloPETase1 was found in marine metagenomes\nand includes an N-terminal signal peptide indicating\nthat the protein is likely secreted into the saline marine\nenvironment. Therefore, we tested degradation of PET\nusing a NaCl gradient ranging from 0.25 to 2 M at\n40, 50, and 60\n/C14 C (Figure1a). The highest total product\nrelease at 40/C14 C after 20 h was observed in the enzyme\nsolution with 1 M NaCl (Figure 1b), whereby higher\nNaCl concentrations led to a decreased product\nrelease. Since the total product release increased con-\ntinuously from 0.25 to 2 M NaCl at 50\n/C14 C, we assumed\nthat NaCl concentrations higher than 2 M would lead to\neven higher total product releases. Consequently, we\nalso tested PET degradation at 50, 60, and 68\n/C14 C with\nup to 5 M NaCl. Notably, the optimal NaCl concentra-\ntions increased with higher reaction temperatures\n(Figure\n1b). We observed the highest total product\nrelease at 50/C14 C with 3 M NaCl. At 60/C14 C, it decreased in\ncomparison to the PET degradation at 50/C14 C, but the\nNaCl optimum increased to 4 M. Similarly, at 68/C14 C\nthe total product release was even lower than at 60/C14 C,\nbut the NaCl optimum increased even up to 5 M.\nTo test the effect of NaCl on the enzymatic thermo-\nstability, we incubated HaloPETase1 up to 3 days at\n50, 60, and 68/C14 C with either 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl. Subse-\nquently, the residual activity was measured by apara-\nnitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) assay (Figure S3). The\nresidual activity after 72 h at 50/C14 C with 5 M NaCl appar-\nently did not decrease. However, we observed a reduc-\ntion of the residual activity to 49% and 74% with 1 and\n3 M NaCl after 72 h, respectively. At 60\n/C14 C, the residual\nactivity dropped to 0.6% with 1 M NaCl after 4 days,\nwhile with NaCl concentrations of 3 and 5 M it\ndecreased to 2.7% and 15.3%, respectively, after 72 h\nat the same temperature. Finally, at 68\n/C14 C, no more\nresidual activity could be observed for all NaCl concen-\ntrations after 1 h. Taken together, these results indicate\na stabilizing effect of high NaCl concentrations on\nHaloPETase1 at higher temperatures.\nNext, we investigated the pH dependent degrada-\ntion in the PET-coated well-plate setup with 100 nM\nHaloPETase1. We observed that the highest total prod-\nuct release at 50\n/C14 C with 3 M NaCl occurs at pH values\nbetween 9.5 and 10, as indicated by the sum of TPA,\nTURAK ET AL. 3o f1 5\n\nMHET and BHET concentrations (Figure1c). The deg-\nradation of PET with sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8\nmainly led to the formation of MHET. However, the deg-\nradation of PET with CAPS buffer at pH 10.5 mainly led\nto the formation of TPA. Both conditions, nevertheless,\nindicated similar total product releases.\nAfter identifying the apparent optimal enzyme concen-\ntration within this experimental framework (Figure\n1d), we\nperformed buffer and pH-dependent PET-degradation\nexperiments with 500 nMHaloPETase1. The release of\nacidic products, such as MHET or TPA, during enzymatic\nhydrolysis of PET can reduce the pH if not sufficiently\nFIGURE 1 Reaction conditions for PET-degradation byHaloPETase1.

(b) NaCl optimum concentrations for PET degradation shift upon increase of reaction\ntemperature. (c) pH-dependent PET-degradation, using 20 mM Bicine for pH 8 and 8.5, 20 mM CAPSO for pH 9 or 9.5, 20 mM CAPS for pH 10,\n10.5 or 11. Incubation at 50\n/C14 C for 20 h.

(h) PET hydrolysis over time byHaloPETase1 and LCC-iccg at 50/C14 C measured in PET-\ncoated well-plates. The analysis was performed with 500 nM enzyme in 0.1 M carbonate with low (0.15 M) or high (3 M) NaCl concentration at\npH 9.5. All PET hydrolysis experiments were performed with 3 technical replicas, error bars indicate standard deviations.\n4o f1 5 TURAK ET AL.\n\nbuffered. This can affect the enzymatic rates due to\neffects on protein stability and activity. Further, the choice\nof buffer can have a concentration-dependent effect on\nenzyme rates of PETases as well (Schmidt et al.,\n2016).\nThus, we increased the buffer concentrations to 0.1 M to\ngain a higher total product release. When degradation\nwas tested at pH 7.5 with sodium phosphate or pH 9.5\nwith carbonate or borate buffer, total product releases\nincreased, yielding between 5 and 6 mM (Figure\n1e). In\nthe case of 0.1 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.5, <2 mM total\nproduct release was observed, indicating an inhibiting\neffect of this buffer.\nFurther, we analyzed PET-degradation byHaloPE-\nTase1 using medium crystallinity PET-films ( /C24 15%\ncrystallinity [see also Figure S11], 150–200 μm thick-\nness, 1 cm/C2 1 cm, /C24 40 mg) in a weight-loss experi-\nment (Figure1f). Here, PET films were immersed in an\nenzyme solution for 7 days at 50/C14 C, and the weight loss\nof the films was subsequently measured. Due to differ-\nences in the PET-coated well plate and PET-film\nassays, the optimal enzyme concentration had to be re-\nevaluated. The highest weight loss ( /C24 25%) was\nobserved with 0.5μM HaloPETase1. An increase in the\nenzyme concentration to 1 and 2 μM showed lower\nweight losses of about 20% and 17%, respectively.\nCorrespondingly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nmicrographs were acquired to analyze changes in the\nsurface topography of the PET films after immersion in\nthe enzyme solution (Figure\n1g). In comparison to the\nnegative control (only buffer treated PET film), the sur-\nface of the 0.5μM HaloPETase1 treated film showed\nthe formation of pit-hole-like topographies with diame-\nters ranging from 10 to 20μm. Similar topography has\nbeen observed previously for the thermostable PETase\nPHL7, where larger pits were seen on PET-disks with a\nsimilar crystallinity (15.8%) upon treatment (Thomsen\net al.,\n2023). Notably, crystal-like formation on the trea-\nted film surfaces may indicate NaCl crystals due to\nbuffer conditions.\nTo compare the PETase-activity ofHaloPETase1 to\nthe benchmark PETase LCC-iccg (an activity and ther-\nmostability improved variant) (Tournier et al.,2020), we\nperformed a hydrolysis time course measurement in a\nPET-coated well plate. Apparently, HaloPETase1 is\ninactive at 50/C14 C in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl. How-\never, increasing the NaCl concentration up to 3 M leads\nto a total product release of about 1 mM after 7.5 h. In\ncontrast, the improved LCC-iccg performs similarly at\nlow and high NaCl concentrations, in both cases reach-\ning a total product release of about 2.5 mM after 7.5 h."}

HaloPETase1 is a salt-tolerant enzyme and\ndepends on higher salt concentrations for the degrada-\ntion of PET at elevated temperatures. These results\nalign well with observations made for dsPETase05\n(Chen et al.,\n2024).\n2.3 | Structure and sequence\nclassification ofHaloPETase1\nBacterial PETases can be classified as type I, type IIa,\nand type IIb based on their structural and sequence\nfeatures near their active sites (Joo et al.,\n2018; Richter\net al.,2023), such as the presence of an extended loop\nsurrounding the active site, the number and position of\ndisulfide bonds, and the amino acid composition at sub-\nsites I and II. Type I PETases have no extended loop\nregions and show one disulfide bond. In contrast, type\nII PETases have extended loop regions and two disul-\nfide bonds; they are further subdivided into type IIa and\nIIb based on differences in the extended loop regions.\nTo better classify HaloPETase1, we elucidated its\nX-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 1.16 Å (PDB\ncode:\n9hl5, Table S3) and compared it to existing\nPETases (Figure 2). HaloPETase1 has the canonical\nα/β hydrolase fold illustrating highly conserved spatial\npositions for its catalytic residues S156, D206, and\nH236 as known forIsPETase (type IIb). There are two\ndisulfide bonds observed: Db I (C64-C126) and Db II\n(C273-C276) (Figure\n2a). While two bonds are charac-\nteristic for type II PETases, these are, however, located\nat different positions in HaloPETase1. Notably, we\ncould not observe a disulfide bond flanking the active\nsite, as it is known forIsPETase (Joo et al.,\n2018).\nPrevious structure analyses on the binding mode of\nPET substrate modules to PETases suggested an aro-\nmatic interaction between the benzene moiety of the\nsubstrate with two opposing aromatic amino acids at\nthe active site. For example, PHL7 (type I) indicated a\ndistorted T-shaped π–π-interaction of F63 and W156\nwith the benzene moiety of TPA in a co-crystal struc-\nture (Richter et al.,\n2023). Similarly,IsPETase showed,\ndepending on the study, up to twoπ-π interactions by\nY87 and W185 (docking of tetrameric PET module and\nmutational analysis) (Joo et al., 2018) or W185\n(QM/MM analysis or complex crystal structure with\nHEMT) (Burgin et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2021). Alto-\ngether, type I and II PETases consist of two opposing\naromatic amino acids such as Y/F and W at equivalent\npositions to F63 and W156 in PHL7, and Y87 and\nW185 inIsPETase.\nIn HaloPETase1, on the other hand, we observed\nthe non-conserved aromatic acid Y180 in subsite I\n(equivalent to W185 inIsPETase, Figure\n2b,c), which\nmight form aπ-stacking interaction with the substrate.\nHowever, instead of an aromatic residue at the equiva-\nlent position of Y87 in IsPETase, we found T88 for\nHaloPETase1. Thus, the so-calledπ-stacking “clamp”\ndoes not exist for HaloPETase1. Further, we\nTURAK ET AL. 5o f1 5\n\nhypothesize that the backbone amide protons of T88\nand Q157 are responsible for the formation of the oxy-\nanion hole in HaloPETase1 since these residues are\nlocated at equivalent positions as M161 and Y87 in\nIsPETase. With the goal of restoring the otherwise\nconserved π-stacking clamp, we tested single muta-\ntions by substituting T88 with either T88W, T88F, or\nT88Y. These mutations led to a reduction of total prod-\nuct release by almost half of the wild-type enzyme\n(Figure\nS4a). A similar result was observed for the\nQ157M mutation. Here, we intended to restore\nthe highly conserved methionine and reduce the polar-\nity in the active site. Neither the restoration of the\nπ-stacking clamp nor the reintroduction of the highly\nconserved methionine showed improved total product\nreleases. We assume that other factors may play a\nrole. For example, larger structural changes affecting\nenzymatic activity or a reduction in thermostability\nmight be responsible for the lower product releases\nunder these reaction conditions. The restoration of the\nπ-stacking clamp might also require further mutations\nfor a cooperative effect to enable the correct architec-\nture for aπ-stacking clamp. Amino acids in the vicinity\nof the introduced aromatic residues might not pair well\ndue to unfavorable interactions or steric hindrances.\nFor example, residue L163 ofHaloPETase1 is appar-\nently placed between the putative π-stacking clamp,\npossibly blocking the insertion of the substrate\nbetween the aromatic residues (Figure\nS4b). It should\nbe noted that this residue is placed on a unique and\nextended loop which is not observed for IsPETase.\nDue to the existence of this loop, no equivalent resi-\ndue for Q157 in IsPETase could be derived for\nHaloPETase1.\nFIGURE 2 Structure and sequence features ofHaloPETase1 in comparison to previously characterized PETases. (a) Crystal structure of\nHaloPETase1 with a resolution of 1.16 Å (PDB code9hl5). Cartoon representation of the protein backbone overlayed with a surface\nrepresentation. The catalytic residues at the active site S156, H236 and D206 are labeled in bold. These residues and the disulfide bonds,\nC64-C126 and C273-C276, are shown as sticks. (b) Superimposed active sites ofIsPETase (PDB:5xjh) andHaloPETase1. Ribbon\nrepresentation of the backbones and stick for sidechains that are associated with PET-activity. Respective amino acids forHaloPETase1 are\nshown in yellow with corresponding labels. These were inferred from the alignment withIsPETase and according to Joo et al. (2018). Residues\nfrom IsPETase are shown as gray sticks. Only residue Q119 from subsite I ofIsPETase is shown in brackets as no equivalent residue could be\nderived forHaloPETase1. (c) Amino acid occupation at the catalytic site, subsites I and II, the extended loop region, and the presence of one or\ntwo disulfide bonds of representative PETases from type I (LCC), IIa (PE-H), IIb (IsPETase) andHaloPETase1. The catalytic triad, subsites I and\nII are highlighted by the same colors as in“b”, thus corresponding to these structure sites.\n6o f1 5 TURAK ET AL.\n\nThe extended loop region, which is known for type II\nPETases, is present inHaloPETase1 as well. However,\nonly P239 and G241 inHaloPETase1 are also present at\nequivalent positions in LCC (type I) and PE-H (type IIa).\nWe found similarities to other PETase types in sub-\nsite II ofHaloPETase1. The amino acid occupation at\nthis part of the active site resembles that of LCC (type\nI). The only difference is the presence of T94, which is\nS101 in the case of LCC (type I). A serine seems to be\nconserved at this position in other PETases: S104 in\nPE-H (type IIa) and S93 inIsPETase (type IIb).\n2.4 | A characteristic active site\narchitecture ofHaloPETase1 and\nhomologs\nThe structural alignment of HaloPETase1 and IsPE-\nTase at subsite I indicates that Q119 (IsPETase) is\nlocated on a loop that is distinct from the corresponding\nloop of HaloPETase1 (Figure 2b,c). Therefore, no cor-\nresponding residue could be derived forHaloPETase1.\nThis difference was also observed for spatially similar\nloops from representative PETases of other types, such\nas LCC (type I, Y129) and PE-H (type IIa, Q130)\n(Figure\n3a). In contrast, HaloPETase1 has a distinct\nand extended loop (loop 3) due to an insertion of five\namino acids (Figure\n4a,b). Notably, L163 in HaloPE-\nTase1, not observed for other PETases, is located on\nthis loop and is potentially involved in substrate\nbinding.\nAnother characteristic loop (loop 2) was observed,\nclose to loop 3, where in other PETases a residue of\nsubsite I is present, for example, Q119 ofIsPETase or\nY95 of LCC. Overall, loop 2 is shorter than correspond-\ning loops of other PETases by five amino acids\n(Figure\n4b). There is potentially no residue on loop 2 of\nHaloPETase1 directly involved in substrate binding.\nNevertheless, loop 2 flanks the active site and is in\nclose contact with loops 1 and 3, indicating an indirect\neffect on substrate binding. Finally, loop 1 ofHaloPE-\nTase1 shows a similar amino acid composition and has\nthe same length as IsPETase and LCC. However, a\nmajor difference is the missing aromatic residue for the\nπ-stacking interaction with the substrate. Note that loop\n1 in PE-H is longer than in other PETases (Bollinger,\nThies, Knieps-Grünhagen, et al.,\n2020).\nBased on these observations, we performed\nanother pHMM search in the proteome ofHalopseudo-\nmonas with a profile consisting of already biochemically\ncharacterized PETases. The goal was to identify more\nPETases resembling HaloPETase1. We identified hit\nsequences with bit-scores ranging from 125.2 to 412.4\n(Table\nS4). The hits were separated into a low bit score\n[<200] and a high bit-score [>200] group."}

The hit sequences\noccurred in one of the two sub-clades according to their\nassigned bit-scores.\nCurrently known PETases consist of a lipase-box\nmotif which includes the catalytic serine and has the\nG-X-S-X-G sequence. For example, type I PETases\nsuch as LCC and PHL7 have a G-H-S-M-G (Richter\net al.,\n2023; Tournier et al.,2020) and type II PETases\nsuch asHaes_PE-H (type IIa) andIsPETase (type IIb)\nhave a G-W-S-M-G motif (Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-\nGrünhagen, et al.,2020; Yoshida et al.,2016). The high\nbit-score group represents the lipase-box motif G-W-S-\nM-G as other type II PETases. Notably, LCC andIsPE-\nTase, as indicated in the tree, are more closely related\nto the high bit-score than the low bit-score group. Pair-\nwise sequence alignment identities of IsPETase and\nLCC with all hits from the high and low bit-score groups\nsupport this observation: the sequence identity of\nTURAK ET AL. 7o f1 5\n\nIsPETase and LCC ranges from 46% to 54% for high\nbit-score sequence alignments (Figure S5), whereas\nthe sequence identities for both PETases ranged from\n23% to 31% for low bit-score sequence alignments\n(Figure\nS6). Finally, hits in the low bit-score group\nrepresent the lipase-box motif G-H-S-Q-G (see\nFigure\nS10), which we observed for the PET-degrading\nenzyme PmC and the newly characterized HaloPE-\nTase1 (see MSA in FigureS7).\nWe included HaloPETase1 in the phylogenetic tree\nand observed that it can be found in the sub-clade with\nother low bit-score hits (Figure4a). HaloPETase1 shows\nhigh sequence identities to other hit sequences in the\nsame group, ranging from 63% to 98% (FigureS5).

Our\nbioinformatic analysis shows that there are two PETase\ngroups in this lineage, whereby HaloPETases5 and\n6 are more closely related to existing PETases such as\nLCC and IsPETase. More specifically, the sequences\nof these enzymes resemble type IIa PETases such as\nHaes_PE-H. In contrast, HaloPETases1, 2, 3, and\n4 form a distinct active site, which is especially seen in\nthe amino acid composition of subsite I and in the\nextended loop region. No typical π-stacking clamp\ncould be identified, and an atypical lipase-box motif for\nbacterial PETases (G-H-S-Q-G) was observed. In addi-\ntion, there are two disulfide bonds that are located at\ndifferent positions in comparison to the ones found in\nother PETase types. Loops surrounding the active site\nshowed either an extended or shortened length com-\npared to known PETases. Therefore, we could not cat-\negorize these enzymes according to the widely\naccepted classification system for PETases (Joo et al.,\n2018; Richter et al.,2023). We propose an extension of\nthis PETase classification system by type III PETases\nthat includeHaloPETase1, 2, 3, and 4, as well asPmC\nand dsPETase05.\nWe believe that the identification ofHaloPETases\nenables the discovery of further polyesterases in the\nbacterial lineage of Halopseudomonas, especially\nFIGURE 4 Phylogenetic tree of putative PETases fromHaloPETase1 homologs in the proteome ofHalopseudomonas.

Considering the wild-type structure ofI. sakaiensis PETase\n(PDB: 6EQE, X-ray diffraction with 0.92 Å resolution) was the first\nreported mesophilic enzyme with affinity and catalytic activity against\nthe PET,\n24 we choose this structure with high resolution as a target to\nperform a detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions established\nbetween the protein and the PET.\nTo perform the molecular docking against theIsPETase binding\nsubsites, we used the AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2)33 program with\nthe following forms mimicking PET: monomer (bis-[hydroxyethyl] tere-\nphthalate, BHET), dimer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-hydroxyethyl tere-\nphthalate)\n2, 2-HE(MHET) 2), and tetramer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-\nhydroxyethyl terephthalate)4, 2-HE(MHET)2).13 Conjecturing that the\nconformation of the PET tetramer in theIsPETase corresponds to that\nof individual monomers bound atIsPETase subsites I to IV, we sequen-\ntially constructed three models of PET: Model I comprises the individual\nPET monomers against four proposed binding subsites of PETase. In\nModel II, we combined two PET monomers, thus forming a dimer to\ndock against two adjacentIsPETase binding subsites. In Model III, we\njoined the four PET monomers forming a tetramer to dock against four\npotential adjacent PETase binding subsites (subsites I to IV).

Since PCA describes the largest amplitude protein\nmotions during a simulation, the bi-dimensional free energy landscape\n(FEL) was obtained taking into consideration the bidimensional projec-\ntions of PC1 versus PC2, which are considered the coordinates used\nfor obtaining the FEL. The FEL of IsPETase in the unbound state\nshowed that at the beginning of the MD, the conformations acquired\nby theIsPETase structure were similar to those obtained at the end of\nthe simulation, thus demonstrating that conformational states of the\nIsPETase were not altered dramatically over the MD trajectory, which\nis in agreement with previous experimental data.\n14,28 We also\nobserved for the analysis of the PCAPC2vsPC3 and PCAPC1vsPC3 plots, a\nconformational dispersion at the end of MD simulation that not\nformed isolated clusters. It is important to note that the conforma-\ntions of the PC1 were not directly correlated with those found in\nPC3, thus demonstrating that the initial conformations were grouped\nseparately from the other conformations that do not contain the PET\nat the binding site (see Figure S9).\nThe main difference between the most stable structure of\nIsPETase-PET complex (P1 in Figure 5) andIsPETase in the unbound\nstate (P4 in Figure 5) is in the β7-α5 connecting loop, where we\nnoted that the Asp206 opened the cavity of the active site. Other\nconformational states with high probability were described for the\nunbound state with P2 with a reduced cavity and P3 with an\nopened cavity similar to that of P1 (Figure 5A). Considering that the\nstructural engineering ofIsPETase using site-direct mutagenesis has\nled to optimized catalysis of PET,\n13,25,69 finding the most stable\nconformation of its structure is an important task for the\nimprovement of its active site selectivity and also to better under-\nstand the conformational mechanism of the enzyme that influences\nin the catalysis.\nThe IsPETase has large regions with polar surface charges with\nfew regions with acidic residues (red surfaces, Figure S10). In the sub-\nsite of monomer 1, more neutral regions are observed, while for the\nother monomers regions high hydrophobic surfaces are detected.\nThere is an increase of the cavity's volumes (see Figure S6) of the sub-\nsites when theIsPETase structure is complexed with the PET, demon-\nstrating conformational conservation of the catalytic triad. It is\nimportant to point out that the wide cleft in the active site would be\nnecessary to accommodate semi-aromatic crystalline polyesters.\n24\nRecently, Knott et al studied the catalytic mechanism of the MHETase\nenzyme converting MHET to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.70\nThe authors demonstrated that the main domain of MHETase is simi-\nlar in the residue composition toIsPETase, which suggests insights\ninto the hydrolysis mechanism of PET performed by theIsPETase.70\nHowever, the mobility of key residues and loops during the binding\nand catalysis remains unclear. Our analyzes of FEL revealed an\nincrease in IsPETase stiffness upon binding of PET, which suggests\nthat binding of PET gives rise to an effective motion ofβ7-α5 con-\nnecting loop, which could have a direct influence on the PET binding\nand catalysis. In particular, we suggest that the rearrangement of this\nloop may be relevant for enabling the adoption of a proper conforma-\ntion for PET recognition.\nThe comparison ofIsPETase states analyzed in the FEL plots (see\nFigure 5 and Figure S11), revealed that the P1 (unbound) and P4\n(bound) states demonstrate that the main conformational change in\nthe transition between the unbound state to the bound state is asso-\nciated withβ7-α5 connecting loop, which that exhibits movements of\nthe residue Asp206 (see Figure S11). In P1 (Figure 5, PETase free), this\nresidue interacts with His237 through hydrogen bond (1.78 Å) in\nIsPETase in the unbound state. While the mobility of theβ6-β7 con-\nnecting loop is associated mainly with the residue Trp185, which has\na fluctuation in the change of states, while important catalytic resi-\ndues, such as Trp159, Ser160, and His237 remain in stable conforma-\ntions (see Figure 5C,D, and Figure S11).\nConsidering that the conformations located at the minima have\nsimilarities to each other, we found that the conformations in P2 and\nP3 of theIsPETase in the unbound state demonstrated a similar con-\nformational change in the connectingβ7-α5 loop (loop 10) to accom-\nmodate the PET substrate (Figure S11A). The minimum conformations\nof IsPETase located at the P5 and P6 showed the PET structure in\ntwo conformations, that is, a planar and L-shape configuration,\nrespectively. The positions of His237 and Ser160 residues were also\nmaintained in both minima. However, it is important to note that the\nAsp209 residue suffers the most conformational changes and\nthe Arg280 residue also showed a variation in its position due to the\nalteration of PET configuration to planar to L-shape. Theπ-π interac-\ntion between Trp185 and the ring of the first monomer was\nmaintained in both minima (Figure S11B). Interestingly, the connecting\nβ1-β2 loop (loop 3) variations were not observed for these minimum\nconformations.\n1348 DA COSTA ET AL.\n 10970134, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26155 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2025].

The RMSD plots of the\nIsPETase structure in the unbound and bound states are shown in\nFigure S3.

Figure S4 shows an\noverview of each MHET moieties (hexagons) complexed at their\nrespective binding subsite during MD simulations.\nMonomer 2 showed the most stable interactions in the elected\nbinding subsites (system II, Figure S4). In contrast, the monomers\nlocated at the ends of the PET polymer (monomers 1 and 4) showed\nhigher mobility. The RMSD plot also showed that the use of a\nrestraint force to maintain the PET in the binding subsite allowed pro-\ntein adjustments for a better fit during the first frames of the MD tra-\njectory. When the restraint force was reduced, the PET conformation\nwas gradually adjusted and remained in the subsite until the end of\nthe 500 ns of simulation.\nWe also analyzed the root-mean-square fluctuation (RSMF) for\nindividual amino acid residue over the 500 ns of MD simulation. This\nanalysis was used as a criterion for quantifying the flexibility of\nIsPETase, where higher RMSF values correspond to more flexible\nregions of the protein during MD simulation. The RMSF shows that\nthe catalytic residues Asp206 and His237 located atβ7-α5 andβ8-α6\nconnecting loop, respectively, presented considerable mobility during\nMD simulations. It is interesting to note that previously, Fecker et al\nanalyzed the conformational changes ofIsPETase over time, as well as\nthe interactions of PET at the subsites; and they found that theβ7-α5\nloop (loop10) flexibility was larger in IsPETase than in its close\ncutinase homologs.\n15\n3.2 | Essential dynamics ofIsPETase\nThe use ofIsPETase for PET degradation is limited due to its low ther-\nmal stability. Thus, we have used essential dynamics to identify the\nflexible regions in the protein structure. These flexible regions in the\nIsPETase can be used as a potential target for enhancing thermal sta-\nbility. Besides, this analysis can also provide insight into the induced-\nsubstrate conformational change inIsPETase.

The results also reveal that participation in the confor-\nmational flexibility of β7-α5 and β1-β2 connecting loop is higher in\nIsPET-PETase complex than inIsPETase without ligand.

The latter two substitu-\ntions introduce a second disulﬁde bond, complement-\ning the native C275–C292 bond. In both wild-type and\nmutant enzymes, the catalytic site is centered on resi-\ndue S165. The crystal structure of the inactive S165A\nLCC-ICCG variant is available in the Protein Data\nBank (PDB ID: 6THS). Our design strategy followed\nestablished protocols [17–19] beginning with the rever-\nsion of residue 165 to the catalytically active serine.\nResidues within 5˚A of S165 were excluded from muta-\ngenesis to preserve active site integrity. Three distinct\ncomputational methods were employed, yielding three\nseparate series of variants.\nThe use of the Rosetta Supercharge method [22]\nwhich aimed at increasing the charge on the surface of\nthe enzyme, led to the identiﬁcation of 1 000 potential\nenzyme variants, from which those 10 that featured\nthe best Rosetta score (which we named C01-C10)\nwere selected for further analysis. PROSS design[21]\nproduced 9 variants (P01-P09), and Disulﬁde-by-\nDesign [23] identiﬁed 125 enzyme variants, from which\nwe selected the best 10, named X01-X10.\nThe 29 candidate enzyme variants originating from\nthe different computational screening methods were\nthen subject to 1 μs molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations in explicit water and ranked based on their\nstability as assessed by RMSF analysis [17]. Our\nMD-based ranking led to the selection of six candidate\nmutants (C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09) for experi-\nmental production and characterization (Fig. 1,\nFig. S1 and Table2).\nThermal stability\nThe six candidate enzymes were expressed in E. coli\nand puriﬁed. The ﬁnal yields of all the enzymes were\naround 16 mg/C1 L\n/C0 1 of bacterial culture (see yield in\nTable S1). Wild-type LCC, a naturally occurring\nPETase, has a Tm of 84.7 °C. This enzyme has been\npreviously engineered by Tournieret al. [15] leading to\nthe LCC-ICCG variant with a reportedTm of 94.0°C\n(93.6 °C in our own assessment, a difference that could\nbe attributed to that fact that, forTm measurements,\nTournier et al. used differential scanning ﬂuorimetry\n(DSF), whereas we used circular dichroism (CD)).\nIndeed, during the thermal stability assessment of the\nenzymes, it became apparent that the determination of\nits melting temperature (T\nm) via differential scanning\nﬂuorimetry (DSF) was unreliable. Speciﬁcally, the\ndenaturation curve could not be accurately derived\ndue to theT\nm approaching 100°C, which is the upper\noperational limit of the Applied Biosystems 7500\nReal-Time PCR System utilized for the DSF measure-\nments. As a result, a complete unfolding transition\n(typically indicated by a plateau) could not be\nobserved for the enzymes within the instrumental con-\nstraints. To overcome this limitation and enable a con-\nsistent comparison across all enzyme variants, we\nemployed CD spectroscopy.

The structural comparison of the C09 vari-\nant with the parent enzymes shows no signiﬁcant\nchanges in the folding, as observed by the minimal\nchange in RMSD with respect to the WT (0.257 ˚A)\nand to the LCC-ICCG variant (0.152˚A). The position\nand orientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242,\nand S265) overlap perfectly with the catalytic triad in\nthe parent enzymes (Fig. 3A). Although we observe\nthat increased stability leads to higher enzymatic activ-\nity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is\nelusive. We hypothesize that the increase in stability\nprovided by the additional surface charges in the C09\nvariant may help to keep the surface-exposed catalytic\nsite in place even at high temperatures, such as those\nused to test the activity of the enzyme (68°C). Indeed,\nall the substitutions introduced in the design process\nare found mostly on the surface of the enzyme and\naway from the catalytic triad (Fig. 3B; Fig. S7)\nand are thus unlikely to affect the activity directly.\nRather, the substitutions may reduce the proportion of\nthe enzyme that may denature over time, and/or pre-\nvent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The\ndenaturation (and the consequent loss of activity) is\nTable 2.List of substitutions relative to the sequence of the wild-\ntype LCC enzyme.

[15]. This\nengineered enzyme is a mutant of the wild-type leaf-branch\ncompost cutinase (LCC) carrying 4 point mutations: F243I,\nY127G, S283C, and D238C. The last two substitutions are\ndesigned to induce the formation of a second disulﬁde\nbond, in addition to the native one (C275-C292). In both\nenzymes, the catalytic site is centered on residue S165. The\nstructure of the LCC-ICCG engineered enzyme is available\nin the Protein Data Bank (PDB code:6THS) as the inacti-\nvated S165A variant.\nIn our design strategy, we applied protocols used in pre-\nvious works [17–19] starting from the LCC-ICCG mutant\nstructure after reverting amino acid 165 from Alanine to\nthe catalytically active Serine. All residues within a distance\nof 5 ˚A from S165 were excluded from the design and were\ntherefore left unchanged. The design was done using three\nseparate methods, resulting in three different series of\nvariants.\nThe ﬁrst design strategy (C-series) was performed using\nthe Rosetta Supercharge tool[22]. This tool was employed\nto reengineer the protein surface with amino acids that pre-\nsent a high net charge, which is reported to prevent aggre-\ngation of partially unfolded states. The design produced\n1024 enzyme variants, and the best 10 based on the internal\nscore were kept for further ranking. The Rosetta Super-\ncharge tool directly provides a 3D model in PDB format\nfor the proposed mutants.\nIn the second design strategy (P-series) we used the\nPROSS web server [21] to generate 9 different enzyme\ndesigns with improved packing, hydrogen bond networks,\nand salt bridge networks. PROSS directly provided the\nPDB structure of the proposed variants.\nThe third design strategy (X-series) employed the\nDisulﬁde-by-Design web server [23] a tool for disulﬁde\nbond prediction that allows ﬁnding pairs of amino acids\nthat can carry cysteine substitutions in the correct orienta-\ntion to form disulﬁdes. A total of 150 pair substitutions\nwere generated and, based on the internal scoring system,\nthe best 10 of them were retained for further testing. In this\ncase, we used the “Mutate Residue” tool in VMD to mod-\nify the proposed positions to cysteines.\nOverall, our design campaign produced 29 different\nenzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD simu-\nlations; then ranked according to the method described in\nprevious works [17–20] Brieﬂy, we solvated each molecular\nmodel with a 15˚A pad of TIP3P water, and we introduced\ncounter ions to neutralize the system charge, resulting in a\nﬁnal simulation box of ≈30.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass\nrepartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs[35].\nThe systems were subjected to 1000 energy minimization\nsteps, and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and\nat a temperature of 300 K with NAMD software[36] using\nAMBER19SB force ﬁeld [37] non-bonded cutoff of 12 ˚A,\nrigid bonds, and particle-mesh Ewald long-range electro-\nstatics. During the equilibration simulation, the Cα atoms\nof the protein were restrained by a 10 kcal /C1 mol\n/C0 1/C1 ˚A/C0 2\nspring constant. The 1μs production runs were performed\nusing a NVT ensemble whereby all the parameters (non-\nbonded cutoff, and PME) were the same as in the equili-\nbration phase. All simulations were run in triplicates. Root\nmean square deviations (RMSD) were monitored after each\nMD run to assess structural convergence, while root mean\nsquare ﬂuctuations (RMSF) were calculated to assess the\nimproved stability of the design. As a result, the two best\nstructures from each design series were selected, namely\ndesign LCC-ICCG-C08, LCC-ICCG-C09, LCC-ICCG-P06,\nLCC-ICCG-P08, LCC-ICCG-X05, LCC-ICCG-X09. In the\nremainder of this document, the “LCC-IGGC-” preﬁx of\nenzyme names is omitted for brevity.\nProtein expression and puriﬁcation\nThe different codon-optimized nucleotide sequences of the\ndesigned PETase mutants were cloned in a pET26b(+) bacte-\nrial expression vector (Novagen, Malvern, Worcestershire,\nUK), together with a C-terminal 6His-tag. All the different\nmutants were transformed and expressed inEscherichia coli\nBL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A\nsample of 4 mL of an overnight culture of the selected strain\ngrown in the presence of 50μg/C1 mL\n/C0 1 kanamycin was inocu-\nlated into 2 L of Luria–Bertani broth (LB) at 37°C, supple-\nmented with 50 mg /C1 L/C0 1 kanamycin and grown until\nOD600 =0.6. The expression was induced with isopropyl 1-\nthio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a ﬁnal concentration of\n0.1 mM followed by overnight incubation at 18 °Ca n d\n8 ª 2025 The Author(s).

Cells were collected by centrifugation and resus-\npended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM\nNaCl) supplemented with 0.2 mM protease phenylmethylsulfo-\nnyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) and DNAse and then lysed by sonica-\ntion on ice. After centrifugation (45 000g for 40 min at 4°C),\nthe soluble fraction of the cell lysate was passed through a\n0.45μmﬁ l t e ra n dt h e nl o a d e do n t oaH i s T r a pH P5 m L( G E\nHealthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) column equilibrated with\nbuffer A (20 m\nM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM Nacl and 10 mM\nimidazole). The Ni afﬁnity column was washed using 10 col-\numn volumes of buffer A. Before elution, ﬁve column vol-\numes (CV) of buffer A supplemented with 50 m\nM imidazole\nwere used to remove unspeciﬁc proteins from the resin. Then,\nthe bound His-tagged enzyme was eluted with the same\nbuffer supplemented with 500 m\nM imidazole in a linear gradi-\nent. The protein eluted completely with 250 mM imidazole.\nThe eluted fraction was loaded onto a PD-10 desalting col-\numn pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 m\nM Tris/HCl pH 8.0,\n300 mM NaCl) for buffer exchange. Buffer exchange was per-\nformed simultaneously after the protein was puriﬁed. The\ndesired protein was concentrated to≈2m g/C1 mL\n/C0 1 using an\nAmicon 20 centrifugal ﬁlter with a molecular cutoff of 10\nkDa and stored at /C0 80 °C. Protein concentration was\nassessed using a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,\nWaltham, MA, USA). Sample purity was evaluated by 12%\nSDS/PAGE. The ﬁnal yields of all the enzymes were around\n16 mg/C1 L\n/C0 1 of bacterial culture.\nCircular dichroism\nCircular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on\na Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at 20°C. CD was per-\nformed to detect the secondary structure of different vari-\nants and to measure the thermostability of the enzyme. The\nspectra were determined with the following parameters:\ncontinuous scanning mode with a scanning speed of\n50 nm/C1 min\n/C0 1, band width 0.1 nm, data pitch 0.1 nm at\n20 °C. A 1.0 mm path length quartz cuvette was used for\n5 μM samples of different enzymes in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH\n8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Thermal denaturation curves were mea-\nsured in 1.0 mm path length cuvettes closed with a paraﬁlm\non protein solutions. Protein denaturation was induced\nupon increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/C1 min\n/C0 1\nfrom 20 °C to 120 °C. The ellipticity at 222 nm was\nrecorded at intervals of 0.2°C using a 1-nm bandwidth and\na response of 10 s.\nThe determination of the midpoints of the thermal dena-\nturation curves (Tm) was done by ﬁtting the data to a sigmoi-\ndal transition curve using a modiﬁed sigmoidal model[38]:\nCD = b /C1 T/C0 cðÞ /C0 d /C1 T/C0 eðÞ\n1 þ T\na\n/C0/C1f/C16/C17\nþ d /C1 T/C0 eðÞ\n(1)\nwhere T is the temperature, a represents the melting tem-\nperature ( Tm), and the terms ( b/C1 T /C0 c) and ( d/C1 T /C0 e)\naccount for baseline drift at low and high temperatures,\nrespectively. The parameter f controls the steepness of the\ntransition. This model allows for accurate ﬁtting of CD\n(circular dichroism) data across the full thermal range, cap-\nturing both transition and baseline behavior (Fig.S2).\nThe secondary structures of all the different variants\nwere measured at 200–250 nm wavelengths and 20°C. Ellip-\nticity was plotted versus wavelength with GraphPad Prism\n10 software. Each recorded spectrum was the average of\nthree scans (Figs S8, S9). CD spectra for the C09 variant\nwere further analyzed using the K2D algorithm of the\nDichroWeb tool[39] (Table S2).\nEnzymatic reaction\nBis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)\nterephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene\nglycol (EG) are the major depolymerization products of the\nactivity of the enzymes on PET. These compounds can be\nseparated efﬁciently on a C18 reversed-phase high-\nperformance liquid chromatography HPLC column, thus\nallowing a precise quantiﬁcation of product formation. All\nenzyme reactions were performed at a concentration of\n40 n\nM at 68°C in quintuplicates in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge\ntubes in the reaction buffer (500 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0,\n300 mM NaCl). Amorphous, 250μm-thick PET ﬁlms (prod-\nuct number ES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow\nUSA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a hole\npuncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4 mg,\nwere then placed in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The esterase\nactivity of enzyme variants was assessed by monitoring the\nhydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA)[24]. Reactions\nwere performed at a concentration of 0.1–1.0 μ\nM in a 96-well\nmicroplate at 25°C using 1 mM pNPA in a buffer containing\n20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. Enzymatic\nactivity was quantiﬁed by measuring the increase in absor-\nbance at 405 nm (Clariostar Plus), corresponding to the for-\nmation of p-nitrophenolate ( ε₄₀₅ = 11.6 m\nM/C0 1/C1 cm/C0 1) (see\nFig. S6).\nReversed-phase liquid chromatography\nThe different compounds produced by PET hydrolytic\nenzymes (TPA, as well as BHET and MHET) were quanti-\nﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC (TablesS3–S5). HPLC ana-\nlyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus\nsystem equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven, and\nan autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations\nwere carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 μm;\n4.6 × 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column\ntemperature was maintained at 40°C with a ﬂow rate of\n1m L/C1 min\n/C0 1. For the mobile phase, 0.1% H3PO4 (solvent\nA) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The linear gradient\nmode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B;\n0–15 min, 10–40% B; 15 –18 min, 40–65% B; 18 –20 min,\n9ª 2025 The Author(s).

Hence, starting from this variant, we set out\nto engineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal sta-\nbility and enzymatic activity. The resulting LCC-\nICCG-C09 design featured a signiﬁcant improvement\nin terms of thermal stability ( T\nm = 97.1 °C) with\nrespect to the gold standard LCC-ICCG ( +3.5 °C).\nUnder optimal reaction conditions (68°C) and at labo-\nratory scale, the LCC-ICCG-C09 enzyme hydrolyzed\nlow-crystallinity PET materials into TPA with a 2-fold\nhigher efﬁciency compared to LCC-ICCG. The LCC-\nICCG-C09 variant may represent a further step\ntowards PET biorecycling. However, further work will\nbe needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant\nconditions.

Genes were expressed\nin E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs,\nIpswich, USA) by cultivation in ZYM auto-inducible medium\n46\nfor 23 h at 21 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by\ncentrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 10 °C) and suspended in lysis\nbuffer (20 mM Tris−HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Cells were\ndisrupted by sonication on ice, and the lysate was clarified by\ncentrifugation (10,000g, 30 min, 10 °C). The soluble fraction\nwas applied to TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, CA).\nAfter unbound proteins were washed with the lysis buffer\nsupplemented by 10 mM imidazole, bound proteins were\neluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris−HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM\nNaCl, 250 mM imidazole). The buffer was finally exchanged\nfor storage buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0 for\nLCC\nICCG\n, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nor 50 mM\nglycine−OH buffer pH 9.2 for HotPETase) using Hiprep 26/\n10 desalting column (GE healthcare, Chicago, IL). Purified\nprotein concentration was determined based on the calculated\nmolar extinction coefficient at 280 nm. Protein purity was\nevaluated by SDS−PAGE analysis.\nAnalytical Method for Melting Temperature Assess-\nment. DSF was used to assess the thermostability of LCC\nICCG\n,\nFAST-PETase, HotPETase, and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nby determin-\ning their melting temperature (T\nm\n). Protein samples were\nprepared at a concentration of 6.25 μM and stored in buffer\nconsisting of potassium phosphate (pH 8.0, 100 mM) for\nLCC\nICCG\n, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, or in glycine−\nOH buffer 50 mM, pH 9.2 for HotPETase. The SYPRO\nOrange dye 5000× stock solution in DMSO was first diluted to\n250× in water. Protein samples were loaded onto a white clear\n96-well PCR plate (Lifescience Bio-Rad, France, catalog no.\nHSP9601) with each well containing a final volume of 25 μL.\nThe final concentration of protein and SYPRO Orange dye in\neach well was 6 μM and 10×, respectively. Loaded volumes per\nwell were as follows: 24 μL of the 6.25 μM protein solution\nand 1 μL of the 250× SYPRO Orange diluted solution. The\nPCR plates were then sealed with optical-quality sealing tape\nand spun at 2000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. DSF\nexperiments were then carried out using a Bio-Rad CFX96\nreal-time PCR system set on the FRET channel to use the\n450/490 excitation and 560/580 emission filters. The samples\nwere heated from 25 to 100 °C at the rate of 0.3 °C s\n−1\n. A\nsingle fluorescence measurement was taken every 0.03 s. The\nT\nm\nwas determined from the peak of the first derivatives of the\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02922\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 13156−13166\n13162\n\nmelting curve using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager software. T\nm\nvalues correspond to the average of three measurements.\nPET Depolymerization Assay Using Amorphous\nGoodfellow Film as Substrate. A 49 mL aliquot of\npotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 100 mM) or glycine−\nOH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) was combined with 100 mg of Gf-\nPET in a 100 mL glass bottle and incubated at 45, 50, 60, 65,\nor 68 °C in a stirring dry bath 15−100 (2mag AG, Munich,\nGermany) under agitation at 200 rpm until the solution\nreached the desired temperature. The depolymerization was\ninitiated by adding 1 mL of a 0.02 mg\nenzyme\nmL\n−1\n(0.7 μM of\nenzyme) solution of purified protein (final concentration of 0.2\nmg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH\n8.0 for LCC\nICCG\n, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, or in\nglycine−OH buffer 50 mM, pH 9.2 for HotPETase. Samples\nwere harvested at 2, 4, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of reaction\ntime and analyzed by ultraviolet light (UV) absorbance\nmeasurements at 242 nm for the determination of PET\ndepolymerization kinetics (see below). Reactions were\nperformed in triplicate.\nPET Depolymerization Assay in a Bioreactor. PET\ndepolymerization reactions at 20% PET (w/w) were\nperformed using 49 mg of purified protein (1.7 μmol)\nprepared in 195 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,\n100 mM) or glycine−OH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) that was\ncombined with 50 g of PcW-PET (98% purity). PET\ndepolymerization reactions at 16.5% PET (w/w) were\nperformed using 40.43 mg of purified protein (1.4 μmol)\nprepared in 203.75 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,\n100 mM) or glycine−OH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) that were\ncombined with 41.25 g of PcW-PET (98% purity). Reactions\nwere performed in a 500 mL Benchtop F1 0.5 MB Bioreactor\n(AD Biotec, France). Temperature regulation was performed\nin the water-jacketed bioreactor, and a double Rushton\nimpeller was used to maintain constant agitation at 800 rpm.\nThe pH value was regulated to pH 8.0 or 9.2 by the addition of\na 20% NaOH (w/w) solution using the ROSITA 2.0 software\n(AD Biotec, France). The kinetics of the PET depolymeriza-\ntion was followed based on NaOH consumption, considering\nthe exclusive production of TPA and EG. Terephthalic acid has\ntwo carboxylic acid groups; therefore, 1 mol of NaOH titrates\n0.5 mol of terephthalic acid. Thus, the conversion of PET to\nterephthalic acid can be easily calculated from the amount of\nNaOH consumed. In addition, samples were harvested at\ndifferent time points and analyzed by UHPLC (see below) to\nadjust PET conversion overtime by considering the TPA/\nMHET ratio (1 mol of NaOH is consumed to titrate 1 mol of\nthe monoacid MHET). The final yield of the PET\ndepolymerization assay was determined either by NaOH\nconsumption or by dry weight determination of residual PET.\nTo determine dry weight of residual PET, the entire reaction\nsolution, including solid particles, was filtered through a 12 to\n15 μm grade 11 ashless paper filter (Dutscher SAS, Brumath,\nFrance) and dried. Maximum productivities in g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nwere estimated from a linear time frame of the NaOH\nconsumption kinetics generated using FAST-PETase, HotPE-\nTase, PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, or LCC\nICCG\n. Average productivities in\ng\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nwere estimated after 24 h of reaction. An\nadditional average productivity in g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nwas\nspecifically estimated after 48 h of reaction when using PES-\nH1\nL92F/Q94Y\n.\nQuantification of Soluble Products Using Ultraviolet\nLight Absorbance. Kinetics of Gf-PET enzymatic depolyme-\nrization were followed by UV light absorbance using a method\nadapted from Zhong-Johnson et al.\n47\nBriefly, the absorbance of\nthe reaction mixtures in the ultraviolet region of the light\nspectrum (at 242 nm) indicates the release of soluble TPA or\nits esters (MHET, BHET, and others) from the insoluble PET\nsubstrate. Standard curves of TPA, MHET, and BHET were\nperformed at 242 nm using an Eon Microplate Spectropho-\ntometer (BioTek, USA). An average coefficient of 16,400 M\n−1\ncm\n−1\ncorresponding to a combination of these products was\nused. Samplings performed at different times (typically at 2, 4,\n6, 9, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) during the hydrolysis of Gf-PET\nwere analyzed by absorbance reading at 242 nm. If necessary,\nsamples were diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,\n100 mM). The absorbance value is used to calculate the overall\nsum of soluble PET hydrolysis products according to the\nLambert−Beer law. The SA of PET hydrolysis in μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nwas determined in the linear part (typically\nbetween 0 and 4 h reaction time) of the hydrolysis curve of the\nreaction. Alternatively, when enzymes suffered from poor\nthermostability, specific activity was determined between 0 and\n2 h of reaction time. The term TPA\neq\ncorresponds to the sum\nof soluble products released from the hydrolysis the PET\npolymer (e.g., TPA, MHET, BHET, and longer soluble\noligomers).\nAnalytical Method for TPA, MHET, and BHET\nDetection by UHPLC. The concentrations of TPA, MHET,\nand BHET were monitored by UHPLC. When required,\nsamples were diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,\n100 mM). Then, 150 μL of methanol and 6.5 μL of HCl 6 N\nwere added to 150 μL of a (diluted) sample. After\nhomogenization and filtering through a 0.45 μm syringe filter,\n20 μL of the sample was injected into a UHPLC column. The\nchromatography system used was a Vanquish UHPLC system\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a\npump module, an autosampler, a column oven thermostated at\n25 °C, and a UV detector at 240 nm. TPA, MHET, and BHET\nwere separated using a gradient of methanol (30 to 90%) in 1\nmM H\n2\nS0\n4\nat 1 mL min\n−1\nthrough a Discovery HS C18 HPLC\ncolumn (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) equipped with a\nprecolumn (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). TPA, MHET, and\nBHET were quantified according to standard curves, prepared\nfrom commercial TPA and BHET (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\nMO) and in-house synthesized MHET,\n13\nunder the same\nconditions as for the samples.\n■\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nsı"}

Numerous\nstrategies have successfully been developed to improve PET\nhydrolase performances in heterogeneous systems. Never-\ntheless, there is still a lack of a standardized approach to\nrationalize the kinetics of these interfacial enzymes, therefore\nhampering fundamental and comparative descriptions of PET-\nhydrolases.\n36\nAmorphous Goodfellow film is a commercially\navailable substrate suitable to compare enzyme performances.\nExchange surface is a key parameter for the efficient hydrolysis\nof PET, and several PET hydrolases have shown very poor\nperformances on amorphous PET film compared to\namorphous PET powder.\n22\nConsequently, cryo-ground Good-\nfellow films sieved under 500 μm (Gf-PET) appear as good\ncandidates for further enzymatic reactions. Comparative\nperformance assessments were performed using an initial\nPET concentration of 2 g\nPET\nL\n−1\n(e.g., 100 mg of Gf-PET in 50\nmL) in a low ionic strength buffer but sufficient to keep a\nstable pH over a theoretically full PET conversion, where 10.4\nmM of TPA would be released. To facilitate the evaluation of\nthe four different biocatalysts studied here (LCC\nICCG\n,\n13\nFAST-\nPETase,\n14\nHotPETase,\n11\nand PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n),\n16\nthe enzyme/\nsubstrate ratio (e.g., mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n), the specific activity (e.g.,\nμmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\n), as well as the final PET conversion\nobtained after a given time of enzyme treatment are provided\nas already pointed out in recent reviews.\n37−39\nAll biocatalysts\nwere purified from Escherichia coli as the expression host\n(Figure S1) and subjected to differential scanning fluorimetry\n(DSF) for melting temperature assessments (Figure S2). The\nevaluated T\nm\nmatched the literature values (Table S1). FAST-\nPETase has the lowest melting temperature (63.3 °C),\nfollowed by PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n(77.6 °C), HotPETase (80.5\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02922\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 13156−13166\n13158\n\n°C), and LCC\nICCG\n(91.7 °C). As mentioned above, it is very\nimportant to perform PET depolymerization at a high\ntemperature, close to the T\ng\nof PET which is near 70 °C\n40−\n43\nin aqueous solution. Enzymes’ performances were evaluated\nat low (nonsaturating) enzyme concentration (0.2 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n) using 2 g\nPET\nL\n−1\nand at five temperatures to match the\noptimal temperature range reported in the literature for each\nenzyme (e.g., 45, 50, 60, 65, and 68 °C). The maximal\ntemperature of 68 °C was chosen to avoid PET recrystalliza-\ntion, which impedes enzymatic PET hydrolysis for all known\nenzymes. In the light of the literature, performances of FAST-\nPETase, PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and LCC\nICCG\nwere evaluated using\n0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 while performances of\nHotPETase were monitored using 0.05 M glycine−OH buffer\nat pH 9.2, as reported in the earlier study.\n11,13,14,16\nKinetics of\nPET depolymerization were assessed using UV absorbance\nanalysis, where all soluble products released during PET\ndepolymerization (e.g., TPA, MHET, BHET, and longer\nsoluble oligomers) can be accounted for. The results of these\nPET depolymerizations are shown in Figure 1a−d and the\nassessed enzymes’ specific activities (SA) are shown in Figure\n1e.\nFAST-PETase has a SA of 246 μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nwhen PET depolymerization is performed at 45 °C and\nexhibited its highest SA at 50 °C, (348 μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\n) (Figure 1e and Table S2) where the reaction\nreached a PET conversion of 10% of hydrolysis after 24 h\nbefore stopping the reaction (Figure 1a and Table S2). When\nPET depolymerization was performed at 60 °C and above,\nFAST-PETase suffered from its low thermostability and\nappeared to be destabilized very rapidly, with no significant\nactivity detected. As expected for a more thermostable enzyme,\nthe SA of HotPETase was improved from 211 μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nat 45 °C up to 1351 μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nat 65\n°C (Figure 1e and Table S2). However, while 25% substrate\nconversion was achieved at 60 °C, only 12% was reached at 65\n°C, reflecting HotPETases’ low stability at temperatures higher\nthan 60 °C (Figure 1b and Table S2). Likewise, PES-\nH1\nL92F/Q94Y\nshowed its highest SA at 65 °C (481 μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\n) (Figure 1e and Table S2), and depolymerization\nstopped rapidly at temperatures higher than 60 °C (Figure 1c).\nWhile the reaction stopped after 9 h to reach 7% PET\ndepolymerization at 65 °C, it was able to run over 24 h at 60\n°C to reach 11% PET conversion. Finally, LCC\nICCG\nshowed its\nFigure 1.

From this first perform-\nance evaluation, we decided to use each enzyme under its best\ntemperature condition (e.g., 50 °C for FAST-PETase, 60 °C\nfor HotPETase and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and 68 °C for LCC\nICCG\n)\nto reassess the enzyme performances under an upscaled PET\ndepolymerization assay, including the new constraints\npreviously described.\nPerformances of the PET Hydrolases under Larger\nScale Bioreactor Conditions. Gf-PET appears to be an\nappropriate uniform PET substrate accessible to everyone to\nperform a comparative evaluation of PET hydrolases through\nSA and stability studies. Nevertheless, it is of great interest to\nfurther corroborate these initial performances by conducting\nenzyme-based depolymerization on a larger scale (e.g., in a 0.5\nL bioreactor) using a significant amount of postconsumer\nwaste polymer (PcW-PET). Even though postconsumer bottle\nflakes are readily available globally from various suppliers, these\nPET samples can be produced by crushing a mix of water,\nsoda, milk, or cosmetics bottles. Still, this crushed material is\nhighly crystalline (typically 30−40% crystallinity), which\nmakes it recalcitrant to enzymatic hydrolysis. A suitable\namorphous material was obtained by rapidly cooling previously\nmelted PET pellets in an extruder at 265 °C and cryogrinding\nthem into sieved PET powder with a particle size of less than\n500 μm.\n5\nThe investment expenditure (CAPEX) dedicated to the\ndepolymerization section mainly relies on the productivity of\nthe PET depolymerization, expressed in grams of products\nreleased per liter and per hour. This productivity is a function\nof three parameters: (i) the concentration of PET waste, (ii)\nthe kinetics of the reaction, and (iii) the final conversion of\nPET and hence the yield of TPA and EG recovered, as\nunderlined by a life cycle assessment study of enzymatic PET\nrecycling.\n24\nTo maximize batch productivity, we aimed for a\nmaximum PET loading in the reactor while ensuring that the\ndisodium terephthalate generated would remain soluble.\nConsidering the disodium terephthalate solubility (13% w/\nw),\n35\nthe addition of a 20% (w/w) NaOH solution for pH\nregulation and the transformation of PET solid polymer into\ntwo water-soluble products, the initial PET waste concen-\ntration can be set at 15.5% (w/w). However, within an\nindustrial facility, an additional water volume must be\nconsidered to clean the reactor, to flush circuits from the\nreactor to the filter, and to wash the postreaction filtrate. Two\nloadings of PET were then tested: 16.5% (w/w) and 20% (w/\nw), considering a post reaction addition of water of 3.5 and\n20%, respectively.\nConsidering the enzymes’ performances described previ-\nously, 16.5% (w/w) PcW-PET depolymerizations were\nperformed at 50 °C when using FAST-PETase, 60 °C for\nHotPETase and PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and 68 °C for LCC\nICCG\n(Figure 2, Table S3). PET substrate conversion reached 15%\nafter 24 h using FAST-PETase at 50 °C (Table S3), but the\nPET depolymerization rate slowed down considerably very\nearly on (2 h after the beginning of the reaction), indicating\ninsufficient stability of this enzyme even at 50 °C (Figure 2).\nConsequently, while Fast-PETase has a maximum productivity\nof 13.5 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\n, the average productivity is only 0.9\ng\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nover 24 h (Table 2). Likewise, HotPETase was\nable to achieve 26% PET conversion in 24 h at 60 °C, but its\nactivity deteriorated after 2 to 3 h of reaction time (Figure 2\nFigure 2. Comparison of 16.5% (w/w) PcW-PET depolymerizations performed by the four enzymes at bioreactor scale. Enzyme-based PET\ndepolymerizations were performed using FAST-PETase at 50 °C, pH 8.0 (orange), HotPETase at 60 °C, pH 9.2 (red), PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nat 60 °C,\npH 8.0 (purple), and LCC\nICCG\nat 68 °C, pH 8.0 (blue) of a 165 g\nPET\nkg\n−1\nsolution with 1 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n. Dots represent the PET conversion in %\nmeasured by the NaOH consumption, considering an exclusive production of TPA and EG (2 mol of NaOH is consumed to titrate 1 mol of the\ndiacid TPA). Crosses represent the percentage of PET conversion adjusted by considering the TPA/MHET ratio (1 mol of NaOH is consumed to\ntitrate, 1 mol of the monoacid MHET).\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02922\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 13156−13166\n13160\n\nand Table S3). A maximum productivity of 10.8 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\ncan be estimated, but it decreases to an average productivity of\n1.57 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nover 24 h (Table 2). Despite all efforts\ndevoted to the evolution of IsPETase, it appears that this\nenzyme still suffers from an intrinsic lack of (thermo)stability,\nand the catalytic properties of HotPETase, including product\ninhibition, are still not aligned with the requirements for its\nimplementation in an enzyme-based PET depolymerization\nprocess on the industrial scale. In contrast, the 80% PET\nconversion obtained after 24 h (96% after 48 h) when using\nPES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nat 60 °C (Figures 2, S3 and Table S3)\nemphasizes continuous enzyme performance when increasing\nthe scale of the PET depolymerization assay. A maximum\nproductivity of 15.5 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\ncan be estimated as well as\nan average productivity of 4.75 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nover 24 h (Table\n2). Last, the highest efficiency in PET depolymerization was\nobserved for LCC\nICCG\nconverting 97% of the PET introduced\ninto TPA and EG in 24 h (Figure 2 and Table S3) with an\naverage productivity of 5.8 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\nand a maximum\nproductivity of 28.6 g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\n(Table 2).\nNotably, during the first hours of the reaction, MHET\nrepresents a significant amount of the degradation products\n(Figure 2 and Table S3). After around 3 h of reaction time\nusing FAST-PETase, HotPETase, PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and\nLCC\nICCG\n, MHET accounts for 58, 21, 57, and 43% of the\nacidic products released (e.g., the diacid TPA and the\nmonoacid MHET), respectively. Conversely, after 24 h, TPA\nbecomes predominant and represents 64, 100, 78, and 100% of\nthe soluble acidic products released, respectively. At 48 h,\nMHET represents only 1% of the total products released by\nPES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n. Using these values, and considering that 2\nmol NaOH is used to neutralize 1 mol TPA while 1 mol\nNaOH is used to neutralize 1 mol MHET, 18.1, 26.4, 90.1, and\n97.3% PET conversion were effectively reached after 24 h for\nFAST-PETase, HotPETase, PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and LCC\nICCG\n,\nrespectively (Figures 2, S3 and Table S3), and 96.2% was\nreached after 48 h for PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n. These values agree\nwith PET conversion calculated from the residual dry weight\nassessment performed at the end of the reaction (Table S3)\n(18.6, 28.7, 98.6, and 98.1% when using FAST-PETase,\nHotPETase, PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n, and LCC\nICCG\n, respectively).\nInterestingly, when considering the whole reaction using\nLCC\nICCG\nat 68 °C, we noticed that 58 and 79% PET\nconversion can be achieved in only 3 and 6 h, respectively,\nillustrating that the last 18 h of the PET depolymerization is\nmostly dedicated to MHET hydrolysis. This MHET hydrolysis\ncan be catalyzed by the enzyme, but it was also demonstrated\nto be due to its spontaneous hydrolysis.\n44\nSuch instability of\nthe MHET might also be accelerated when PET depolyme-\nrization is performed at a higher pH, as it is the general rule for\nester hydrolysis\n45\nand could explain the lack of MHET\naccumulation observed during the PET depolymerization at\npH 9.2 using HotPETase.\nAt 20% PcW-PET loading, the overall behavior is like the\none observed at 16.5% for the four enzymes (Figures S4 and\nS5, Tables S4 and S5). With the exception of PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\n,\nthe increase in productivity is linear between the two PET\nloadings.

To improve the activity and thermostability of such\nPETases, various concepts of protein engineering were\nimplemented, such as rational design,\n13\ndirected evolution,\n11\nor AI-assisted in silico protein design.\n14\nThe field has greatly\nbenefited from these studies, since they have opened a plethora\nof new possible avenues for enzymatic PET recycling.\nUnfortunately, a thorough comparison of enzyme performance\nremains problematic since no international scientific consensus\nfor the evaluation of PET hydrolase performance has emerged.\nThe nature and properties of the substrates used can differ as\nwell as reaction conditions, analytical methods, and more\nimportantly readout parameters. In our study, we targeted over\n90% (ideally 95%) PET depolymerization from the perspective\nof a viable large-scale biotechnological process development.\nWe postulated that studies solely relying on enzyme specific\nactivity as readouts were unable to assess the true applicability\nof the enzymes for industrial deployment. One of the reasons is\nvery likely the number of new constraints to be considered on\na larger scale. As a first step, we have therefore performed a\nstandardized small-scale PET depolymerization study of four\nengineered PET hydrolases (e.g., FAST-PETase,\n14\nHotPE-\nTase,\n11\nPES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y 16\n, and LCC\nICCG 13\n) to evaluate their\noptimal temperature condition. Such standardization com-\nprised the use of cryo-ground amorphous commercial\nGoodfellow film with known particle size distribution, a fixed\nenzyme/substrate ratio (mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n), and a fixed polymer\nconcentration (g\nPET\nL\n−1\n). Enzymes’ performances were\nevaluated at such small scale by determining standardized\nparameters such as final PET conversion/terephthalic acid\nformed after a given time and enzyme-specific activity values\n(μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nor g\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\n) as\nrecommended elsewhere.\n37\nThen, a thorough comparison of\nthe four PET hydrolases was performed in bioreactors using\nhigh concentrations of pretreated postconsumer PET waste\nmaterial (165 and 200 g\nPET\nkg\n−1\n) to mimic the conditions of\nan industrial process. Parameters such as the average and\nmaximum productivity (expressed in g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\n), the PET\nconversion/terephthalic acid formed after a given time, and the\npurity of the products (e.g., TPA, MHET) were carefully\nassessed. We find that a typical weakness of the PET degrading\nenzymes is the deterioration of the activity over a long−time\nreaction that is in turn required to achieve 100% substrate\nconversion. FAST-PETase showed convincing performances in\nterms of specific activities at both reactor scales, but the\nkinetics of PET conversion in the reactor dramatically slowed\ndown to reach less than 20% at 24 h. This observation appears\nto be in-line with the previous study where FAST-PETase\nenabled a 90% PET depolymerization from a 45 g\nPET\nL\n−1\nsolution (e.g., amorphized PET bottle flakes) after 14 days at\n50 °C but necessitating a daily replenishing of fresh enzyme\nTable 2.

Likewise, Bell et al. have\nshown a substantial decrease in PET conversion after 5 h of\nreaction using HotPETase correlated to enzyme deactivation\nbut not to product inhibition or PET.\n11\nComparatively, PES-\nH1\nL92F/Q94Y\nand LCC\nICCG\nappeared more stable over time in\nreactor conditions, and near-complete PET conversions\n(∼98%) were attained within 48 and 24 h, respectively, at\n16.5% PET loading (81 and 98% PET conversion at 20% PET\nloading, respectively). LCC\nICCG\nand PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nthus\nappear as good candidates for the deployment of an enzyme-\nbased-PET-depolymerization process.\nThe behavior of PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nin the reactor is intriguing.\nIts T\nm\nis lower than that of HotPETase (77.6 and 80.7,\nrespectively) and in small reactors, at low PET concentration,\nand in nonsaturating enzyme conditions, the reaction stops\nrapidly at less than 12% conversion. This contradiction cannot\nbe simply explained by low stability or inhibition by the\nproducts. Further investigations are necessary to solve this\nmystery.\nSince the last study describing LCC\nICCG\nperformance,\n13\nreaction conditions have been largely improved in this work.\nWhile 95% PET conversion was previously obtained after 24 h\nusing 3 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\nat 72 °C,\n13\n98% PET conversion was\nobtained here by introducing 1 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\nat 68 °C.\nReducing the temperature of the reaction by 4 °C enabled the\nPET recrystallization kinetics to be reduced, which favors\nobtaining high conversion. The positive outcome was a\nreduction of the amount of enzyme by a factor of 3 while\nincreasing the final PET conversion in the same time frame\nand consequently decreasing the cost of waste treatment. Such\nenzyme performance is meeting one of the bottlenecks\ndescribed in a comprehensive LCA study of enzymatic\nrecycling of PET, highlighting the need to achieve conversions\ngreater than 90% at high PET concentrations to minimize\npostreaction waste.\n24,28\nFinally, TPA and EG monomers are\nexclusively produced without the accumulation of MHET in\nthe solution, simplifying the purification scheme of the\nproducts.\nWe believe that our study of PET hydrolases will contribute\nto finding a consensus on the methods used and key\nparameters to consider when performing a large-scale PET\ndepolymerization. Such a consensus is necessary for the\ndeployment of the first generation of enzymatic PET recycling\nprocesses at an industrial scale. We also believe that this field\nwill further benefit from new technologies to emerge as well as\nnew superior enzymes being able, for instance, to perform\nefficient degradation of semicrystalline PET to minimize the\nPET pretreatment steps as underlined in a previous study.\n28\nUltimately, new acid-tolerant PET hydrolases able to perform\nefficient PET depolymerization with no (or a minimal) need of\nsoda for pH regulation would also be of great interest to\nfurther strengthen the concept of enzymatic PET hydrolysis in\nthe frame of a circular economy.\n■"}

Cui, Chen, et al., 2021b). The\nGRAPE strategy included three main steps: 1) The generation of\nstabilizing mutations with multiple algorithms (e.g., ABACUS,\nFoldX, Consensus analysis) led to the identi ﬁcation of\n253 unique predicted mutations. 2) The characterization of\nbeneﬁcial mutations based on biophysical pitfalls led to a\nsublibrary of 85 candidates. Among them, 21-well-expressed\nmutants were determined to show increased stability. Based on\nthe K-means algorithm, these 21 identi ﬁed hits were further\nclustered into three groups for the subsequent accumulation\nprocess. 3) Accumulation of the mutations in each cluster\naccording to the greedy algorithm based on the stability-\nmediated physical features led to a total of 65 combined variants,\namong which IsPETase-M10 (named DuraPETase, S214H-I168R-\nW159H-S188Q-R280A-A180I-G165A-Q119Y-L117F-T140D)\nfrom the third cluster was identiﬁed as the most thermostable\nvariant, displaying dramatically increased thermostability. The T\nm\nvalue of DuraPETase was increased to 77°C, which was enhanced by\n~3 1°C compared with wildIsPETase.\nWhen applied for the digestion of semicrystalline PET ﬁlm\n(30%) after 10 days at 37°C, the released soluble products reached up\nto 3.1 mM, and the conversion was determined to be ~15 ± 1%,\nFIGURE 4\nStructure analysis of Dura-PETase [(A), PDB ID: 6KY5] and the interactions between the mutations(B–E).

Importantly, at 37°C, complete\ndegradation of nanoplastics (⌀ =5 0–100 nm) was catalysed by\nIsPETase and DuraPETase within 1 h. Structure analysis and\nmolecular simulation showed that the mutations introduced new\nelectrostatic interactions (I168R, shown as orange linesFigure 4C),\nimproved hydrophobic packing [L117F, Q119Y, A180I, S214H, and\nR280A, shown as pink lines ( Figures 4C, E ), reduced the\nconformational entropy (G165A, Figure 15D), and led to the\nformation of additional H-bonds (shown as green lines).\nIn particular, the W159H mutation located near the catalytic\ntriad probably reconstructed the binding site of DuraPETase (shown\nin grey surface,Figure 4B), which is also true for the functions of the\nL117F and Q119Y mutations viaπ-π interactions with Tyr87. S214H\nwas concluded to be capable of preventing the wobbling of\nTrp185 by an offset parallel π-π stacking interaction. Mutations\nS214H, Trp185, Tyr87, L117F, and Q119Yﬁnely regulate the active-\nsite cleft suitable for PET binding, which was named the“aromatic\ntunnel” ﬂanker. Tyr87, Q119Y, and Trp185 could enhance PET\nbinding through π-π interactions with the aromatic motif. The\nincorporation of these mutations might contribute to the\nincreased catalytic performance, which further illustrates the\nimproved ability to lower the likelihood of combining mutations\nwith adverse effects and a lack of target protein structures in enzyme\nengineering.\n2.1.2.5 DuraPETase\nN233C/S282C/H214S/S245R\nBased on DuraPETase, another mutant named DuraPETase-4\nM (DuraPETaseN233C/S282C/H214S/S245R) was designed to increase the\noverall rigidity (N233C/S282C), regulate the ﬂexibility of the\nW185 region (H214S), and optimize the protein surface\nFIGURE 6\nStructure analysis of FAST-PETase (PDB ID: 7SH6) and the interactions of different mutants with favourable residues [(B–E), the red residues mean\nthe mutant residues].

Liu, Liu, et al., 2022a). It should be\nnoted that the H214S substitution led to decreased stability at 60°C,\nand the degradation performance against the amorphous PET\npowder was signiﬁcantly improved. This also reﬂects the activity-\nstability trade-offs. When maintained at 60°C for 96 h, DuraPETase-\n4Me fﬁciently hydrolysed the PETﬁlm (crystallinity 10.2%) with a\ndegradation percentage of 69.8%, which is a 5.4-fold improvement\nover DuraPETase.\nSimilarly, an electrostatic interaction-based method was\ndeveloped for the rational design of IsPETase and investigating\nthe roles of electrostatic interactions in thermostability (Yin et al.,\n2022). Residues S92 (on theα3 helix), I139 (on theα4 helix) and\nD157 (on the loop connectingβ6 andβ7) on the protein surface were\nrationally selected and mutated to the positively charged residues.\nThe I139R mutation led to the highest increase inΔT\nm of 8.71°C\n(Tm = 56.37°C), the R251A mutation caused a Tm value increase of\n4.68°C( Tm = 52.34°C), and the S92R/D157E mutation resulted in an\nincrease of 2.18°C( Tm = 51.48°C). Introduction of the R251A\nmutation into the above obtained mutants further improved their\nT\nm values, which were 53.08°C( ΔTm = 5.42°C) and 54.80°C( ΔTm =\n7.14°C) for theIsPETaseS92K/R251A variant andIsPETaseS92R/D157E/R251A,\nrespectively. With improved thermostability, IsPETaseI139R also\ndisplayed a 3.6-fold improvement in degradation activity.\nInterestingly, using the MHET substrate at 30°C, the kcat of the\nIsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A variant was shown to be increased by 1.74-\nfold. In particular, the IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A variant could fully\ndegrade PET into TPA alone without MHET, which might be caused\nby a narrower substrate binding cleft. Thus, only the smaller, EG\nmoiety was capable of entering the active site for further hydrolysis.\nThis is an unusual and importantﬁnding, especially for promoting\nthe PET circular economy in the future.\n2.1.2.6 FAST-PETase (PETase\nS121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A)\nIn a similar study, rational protein engineering based on a\nstructure-based machine learning algorithm was applied for the\ndesign of robust and efﬁcient PET hydrolase (Lu et al., 2022).\nMutCompute (https://mutcompute.com), a web-based tool based\non deep learning-guided predictions for protein mutagenesis, was\nused for the discovery of thermostable mutants (Figure 5). From all\n29 possible combinations with the four obtained mutations (S121E,\nT140D, R224Q and N233K) across the three promising PETase\nFIGURE 7\nThe overall structure of HotPETase (PDB ID: 7QVH) and the\nmutant amino acids (shown in ball and stick representation).\nFIGURE 8\nThe overall structure of MHETase(A), (PDB ID: 6QG9) and the structure alignment(B) of MHETase, an esterase from Aspergillus oryzae (PDB ID:\n6Q21) and the IsPETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis(PDB ID: 6QGC).

In\nparticular, FAST-PETase (PETase\nS121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A) showed\na 38-fold increase in PET hydrolytic activity at 50°C compared with\nthat of ThermoPETase, with 33.8 mM PET monomers released after\n96 h. Even compared with LCC and LCC\nICCM, FAST-PETase also\ndemonstrated better performance at mild temperatures and\nmoderate pH conditions. In particular, at 50 °C, FAST-PETase\ndisplayed the highest overall depolymerization rate of the highly\ncrystalline substrates compared with the thermophilic enzymes\n(LCC and ICCM), IsPETase and ThermoPETase and\nDuraPETase. Moreover, FAST-PETase is capable of\ndepolymerizing the pretreated ﬁlms (~2% crystallinity) by quick\ntemperature quenching, releasing 32.8 mM PET monomers at 50\n°C\nafter 24 h. It could even degrade highly crystalline (23.6%)ﬁlms by\nreleasing 23.8 mM PET monomers.\nStructure analysis ( Figure 6 ) revealed several additional\nintramolecular salt bridges (shown in the orange line formed\nbetween the K233 mutation and E204), Figure 6B), hydrogen\nbonds (Figure 6B–D, shown in green lines) and hydrophobic\ninteractions (shown in pink lines formed between the\nH186 mutation, P120 and F191, Figure 6C). Importantly, the\nportability and effectiveness of these machine learning-based\npredictions were further validated by the introduction of the\ncorresponding N233K mutation to LCC, ICCM and Cut190. The\nresults showed that theΔT\nm values of LCCD238K and Cut190D250K\nFIGURE 9\nThe interaction modes of MHETase with a nonhydrolyzable ligand MHETA(A, B, E); PDB ID: 6QGA and with benzoic acid(C, D); PDB ID: 6QGB. (The\nlight blue surface indicates the substrate-binding site).\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org11\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\nwere increased by 7°C, although the ΔTm of ICCMC238K/C283S was\ndecreased by 3.7°C on amorphous gf-PET.\nRaghav Shroff et al. developed a structure-based deep learning\nmodel, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), which could be\ntrained to deduce amino acid-structure relationships by connecting\namino acids with the local chemical microenvironments (Shroff\net al., 2020). This would be helpful for the discovery of novel gain-of-\nfunction mutations that might be missed by energetics-based\nstrategies. It empirically identiﬁes native residues discordant with\ntheir structural and chemical expectations or the local environment\nas ideal targets for rational protein engineering. The results indicate\nthat this strategy performs better in combination with the widely\nused protein design tools based on energetics simulations and\ngenerates potential gain-of-function mutants with high-frequency\nand state-of-the-art accuracy. Ultimately, the obtained mutants with\nimproved function in vivo were determined to be increased by\napproximately 6- and 30-fold across three diverse proteins.\n2.1.2.7 HotPETase\nRobust PETases satisfying the demands of industrial processes\nare key to realizing industrial plastic biodegradation. To further\nimprove the thermostability of IsPETase, an automated, high-\nthroughput directed evolution protocol was reported for the\nscreening and identi ﬁcation of promising PET-degrading\nbiocatalysts (Bell, Smithson, and Kilbride, 2022 ). The reaction\ntemperature and the extended reaction time were used for\nselection pressure. After six rounds of evolution, the most\nthermostable IsPETase variant, HotPETase\n(IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A/P181V/S207R/S214Y/Q119K/S213E/N233C/S282C/R90T/Q182M/\nN212K/R224L/S58A/S61V/K95N/M154G/N241C/K252M/T270Q, Figure 7 , PDB ID:\n7QVH), was identi ﬁed. It contains 21 amino acid mutations\ncompared to the wild IsPETase, and the Tm (82.5°C) was\nincreased by 25.7°C compared with the starting IsPETaseTS.A t\n65°C, after 1 h, each mole of HotPETase releases more monomers\nthan LCCICCG does, revealing its superior catalytic performance. In\nparticular, under the optimal conditions, 0.5μM HotPETase could\ndegrade cryPET (0.4% crystallinity, 4 g/L), releasing 6.07 mM soluble\nmonomer within 5 h at 60°C with a degree of depolymerization of\n31%. This is the most promising IsPETase mutant for PET\nbiodegradation.\nCrystal structure analysis showed that the P181V mutation\ncreated an additional hydrogen bond, altered surface charge\ndistributions, especially in the substrate binding cleft, and\nsubstantially decreased ﬂexibility around the regions formed by\nthe residues from Ala183 to Asn190 and Cys203 to Leu216. The\nmentioned mutations would further improve the packing of the\ncentral β-sheet region; moreover, the well-deﬁned conformation of\nTrp185 was shown to be unnecessary for ef ﬁcient PET\ndeconstruction. This ﬁnding illustrates the obscure functions of\nP181 (Son et al., 2019).\n2.1.2.8 GrAnc8\nIn a recent study ( Joho et al., 2023 ), ancestral protein\nreconstruction (ASR) was used to understand the evolutionary\nhistory of IsPETase from ancient serine hydrolases. First, the\nphylogenetic trees and ancestral sequences were reconstructed\nwith the ASR1 dataset (82 sequences, constructed by GRASP)\nand ASR2 data (147 sequences, constructed by CodeML). Then,\nthe Rosetta-based algorithm protein repair one-stop shop (PROSS)\nwas used for the identiﬁcation of evolutionarily conserved mutations\nresponsible for stability and catalytic activity. This resulted in a\nlibrary of 15 PETase mutants containing 9 to>50 mutations, among\nwhich 5 mutants (GrAnc9, GrAnc8, CoAnc3, PROSS4, PROSS5)\nexhibited signiﬁcantly increased thermostability with T\nm values\napproximately 20°C higher than that of the wildIsPETaes.\nIn particular, the mutant GrAnc8 was determined to be the best\nperforming ancestor in terms of stability and activity. Through\nstructure analysis, signi ﬁcant variation in surface-exposed\nresidues was identi ﬁed, especially those lining the substrate\nbinding site. It was believed that the more cationic trend might\ncause the improved stability; however, this (the altered surface\ncharge) was determined to be unrelated to any functional\nFIGURE 10\nThe crystal structure of MHETase with benzoic acid(A), PDB ID: 6QZ3), the detailed binding modes of benzoic acid(C) and the special conformation\ncaused by substrate binding(B).

In addition, the deletion of a surface-\nexposed loop (ADLK) between S278 and T279 was expected to\nresult in a clear increase in thermostability. Moreover, it was shown\nthat a segment around the active site (R171A, N186D, F218I, S214H,\nD186S) played critical roles in regulating the degradation activity\nand thermostability by accommodating the conformations of W185.\nThe structural basis for the evolution of the improved activity\nrevealed that it is mainly caused by remote mutations through\nthe increased level of sampling of catalytically productive\nconformations of the existing functional residues. In this study,\nthe activity-stability trade-offs were also conﬁrmed, as in the case of\nS214H, D186S and D186N, which increased stability but decreased\nactivity.\n2.1.3 MHETase\nAttention has been attracted again by the MHETase for PET\ndegradation, accompanied by the rapid development ofIsPETase for\nthe efﬁcient conversion of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n(MHET) to terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)\nwith kcat = 31 ± 0.8 s−1 and Km = 7.3 ± 0.6 mM. Compared with\nIsPETase, there are far fewer reported studies on the structures,\nfunctions and engineering of the MHETase enzyme.\nIn the hostI. sakaiensis201-F6, the MHETase gene (ISF6_0224)\nis located adjacent to the TPA-degrading gene cluster (Yoshida et al.,\n2016), and the protein sequence shows sequence similarity to those\nof the tannase family with highly conserved catalytic triad residues.\nHowever, MHETase is determined to be nonhomologous to the\n6 determined MHET-hydrolytic enzymes (TfH, FsC, Thc_Cut1,\nThc_Cut2, Thf42_Cut1, BsEstB), which was also con ﬁrmed by\nthe fact that MHETase was unable to degrade PET, BHET or\npNP aliphatic esters catalysed by the tannase.\nWeber et al. reported the crystal structure of the active ligand-\nfree MHETase from I. sakaiensis bound to a nonhydrolyzable\nMHET analogue (Palm et al., 2019). The overall architecture of\nMHETase is more similar to that of feruloyl esterases (Figure 8B),\nand it possesses the classic α/β-hydrolase domain, the highly\nFIGURE 11\nThe structure alignment of MHETase with different ligands(A, B), the detailed structure of MHETase with BHET(C), PDB ID: 6JTT) and the interaction\nmodes (D).

The disulﬁde bond can\nstabilize the catalytic residues Ser and His, and the lid domain\nassociated with substrate speciﬁcity might be further maintained by\nthe bound Ca\n2+ (Suzuki et al. 2014).\nThe binding mode of the MHETase-MHETA complex (Figures\n9A, C) revealed that the substrate speciﬁcity is almost entirely\nconferred by the lid domain. In the substrate binding site, the\nsubstrate MHETA is stabilized by the hydrophobic interaction\nbetween the phenyl ring of MHETA and the residues F495,\nG132 and A494 (Figure 9B). Furthermore, the free carboxylate is\ntightly bound by the lid domain residues R411 and S416 and two\nwater molecules through H-bond interactions. In addition, the\npeptide bond maintains a hydrogen bond network with H528,\nG132 and E226. In particular, F415 functions as a“gatekeeper”\nthat is positioned away from the active site when the enzyme is ready\nfor substrate binding; once the substrate is bound, the side chain of\nF415 is triggered to rotate by nearly 180\n°, closing the gate. This\nprobably leads to much tighter interactions between MHETase and\nthe substrate with a K\nm of 7.3 μM. The functions of R411 were\nfurther investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the results\nshowed that R411A and R411Q almost completely lost their MHET\nhydrolysing activity. This is also true of S416 or S419 for regulating\nsubstrate binding. Moreover, R411A, R411Q and F424N, with\naltered positive charges, displayed signiﬁcantly higher hydrolysing\nactivity against BHET, indicating altered substrate speciﬁcity.\nRecently, a 1.6 Å resolution MHETase structure was reported\n(Figure 16) (Knott et al., 2020), which also highlights the MHETase\ncore domain, the lid domain and a Ca\n2+ binding site, similar to the\noverall structure in Figure 10A . As discussed above, distinct\nstructural conservation is also revealed between the MHET-\nhydrolysing domain of MHETase and IsPETase. Except for the\nobserved F415 adopting a“closed” orientation on substrate binding,\nthe side chain of G410 would also trigger the active site with ligand\nbinding (Figure 10B)."}

First,\ncatalytic S225 is activated and deprotonated by H528, making it\nready for nucleophilic attack upon the carbonyl C of MHET, which\nwill lead to the formation of released, EG and the acyl-enzyme\nintermediate. It is worth noting that the deacylation reaction\nproceeds without, EG in the active site, and the nucleophilic\nattack on the AEI by a water molecule liberates TPA. This\nprocess was also assisted by H528, which could deprotonate the\nFIGURE 12\nThe overall structure of PHL7(A) and the interaction modes(B,C).

Biochemical studies showed that MHETase\nalso displayed concentration-dependent substrate inhibition with a\nK\nm value of 23.17 ± 1.65μM and aKk value of 307.30 ± 20.65μM.\nAlthough MHETaseS131G showed little concentration-dependent\nsubstrate inhibition, it displayed an 8-fold higherKm value and\nan ~3% reduction in catalytic activity, indicating a poor afﬁnity\nfor MHET.\nThe catalytic performance of the lidless MHETase was also\nexplored, which led to a signi ﬁcantly decreased catalytic rate\n(~1,000-fold lower, kcat = 0.05 ± 0.03 s−1). This demonstrates the\nimportant role of the lid domain in MHET-hydrolysing activity. The\ninability of MHETase to act on MHE-isophthalate (MHEI) and\nMHE-furanoate (MHEF) was also detected. Considering the\nsynergistic effect on PET depolymerization, chimeric enzymes\nwere constructed withﬂexible glycine-serine linkers (8–20 glycine\nand serine residues) connecting the C-terminus of MHETase to the\nN-terminus of PETase. The results showed that the chimeric\nproteins all exhibit markedly improved PET and MHET turnover\ncompared with the single free enzyme or the mixed two free\nenzymes. In my opinion, this ﬁnding is quite important for the\ndesign of promising and effective multienzyme systems for the\nefﬁcient degradation of PET waste.\nThe secretory expression of MHETase in an active form with\nproper folding was achieved by Kim et al. inEscherichia coli with\nthe SP\nLamB system (Hye Young Sagong et al., 2020). It was found\nthat MHETase might exist as a monomer, in contrast to the\nstructural homology of the dimer feruloyl esterase from\nAspergillus oryzae . This was believed to be caused by the\ndifferent conformation of its lid domain, which could inhibit\nsubsequent dimerization. The overall structure of the secreted\nMHETase is almost identical to the released structure and\nfunctions in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner.\nCrystal structure analysis showed that the binding modes of\nMHET and BHET in the active site of MHETase are quite\nsimilar to each other ( Figures 11A, B ); in addition, the TPA\nmoiety was found to form an es ter bond with the catalytic\nS225 residue. This indicates that BHET could also be\nhydrolysed by MHETase, which was further con ﬁrmed to\nfunction in a concentration-dependent manner although with\nas i g n iﬁcantly lower hydrolysing activity. The BHET was bound\nto the active site lined by R411, S416, G258, W420, A494, L254,\nD492, H528, and S225. The, EG moiety was further stabilized by\nR411, S416, G258 and L254 through H-bonds, and the TPA\nmoiety was also regulated by hydrophobic interactions with\nA294 and L254. The special conformation of the, EG moiety\nindicates that MHETase might also display exo-PETase activity\ncapable of hydrolysing the terminus of PET, which was conﬁrmed\nby the successful hydrolysis of PET\n5 to TPA.\nGiven these, rational engineering of the MHETase for improved\nBHET-hydrolysing activity was achieved. First, MHETaseR411K was\ndesigned to add a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of MHET to\nstabilize the ester bond. The protein was obtained and determined to\nshow a 1.7-fold increase in activity compared with that of wild-type\nMHETase. Second, to remove the steric hindrance effect caused by\nF424 located in the inner substrate-binding site and to provide\neffective space and potential hydrogen bonding partners for BHET\nbinding, MHETase\nF424N, MHETaseF424V, and MHETaseF424I were\nconstructed, and the BHET-hydrolysing activities were increased\nby ~3.9-, 3.0-, and 3.4-fold, respectively. Combined with the R411K\nmutation, the obtained double mutants (MHETase\nR411K/F424N,\nMHETaseR411K/F424V, and MHETase R411K/F424I) all displayed\nimproved catalytic activity, especially the MHETaseR411K/S416A/F424I\nvariant, which exhibited a 15.3-fold increase in BHET hydrolysis\nactivity. At the same time, MHETase\nR411K/F424V, MHETaseR411K/F424I,\nand MHETase R411K/S416A/F424I exhibited signi ﬁcantly enhanced\ndegradation activity against the PET5 oligomer compared with\nwild-type MHETase. Although the obtained mutants displayed\nno hydrolysing activity against the amorphous PETﬁlm without\na terminus, wild-type MHETase showed degradation activity against\nthe PETase\nS121A/D186H/R280A-treated PET ﬁlm, and\nMHETaseR411K/S416A/F424I displayed even higher hydrolysing\nFIGURE 15\nThe structural alignment of PE-H with IsPETase(A) and the main structural characteristics(B).

The BHETase activity and the exo-PETase activity of\nMHETase were further conﬁrmed by these results.\n2.2 Other novel PET hydrolases\n2.2.1 PHL7\nA novel PET hydrolase (PHL7, ENA accession number:\nLT571446, PDB ID: 7NEI) was isolated from plant compost and\nis capable of degrading amorphous PETﬁlms and postconsumer\nPET with high efﬁciency (Sonnendecker et al., 2022). The overall\nstructure of PHL7 is almost the same as that of LCC\nS165A (PDB ID:\n6THS, Figure 12), displaying the typical features of the α/β-\nhydrolase fold superfamily with a highly conserved Ser-Asp-His\ncatalytic triad. It is believed that the similar overall crystal structure\nand substrate-binding cavity would lead to similar catalytic\nmechanisms. Importantly, the active site pocket of PHL7 is more\nopen than that of LCC, mainly because of the different\ncorresponding residues F63, L93, Q95 and I179. This difference\nmight be helpful for the binding of larger PET substrates and could\nbe a key to more tolerant recognition and effective processing of PET\nat elevated temperatures concomitant with increased polymer chain\nmobility.\n2.2.2 BgP\nDobson et al. screened 51 marine bacterial isolates for the\ndiscovery of potential ester/polyester hydrolytic catalysts, in\nwhich Brachybacterium ginsengisoli B129SM11 was identi ﬁed\nfrom the deep-sea sponge Pheronema sp .a sap o t e n t i a lP E T -\ndegrading polyesterase producer ( Carr et al., 2022). Sequence\nanalysis combined with a genome “mining ” strategy (Almeida\net al., 2019) revealed a putative PET hydrolase (named BgP) that\nshares high sequence simi larity with TfCut2 (62%).\nBioinformatics analysis show ed that 54% of the residues in\nBgP are identical to Cut190; moreover, 83% of the amino acid\nresidues displayed similar biochemical properties to those of\nCut190, such as highly conserved features (e.g., α/β fold). A\nsingle disul ﬁd eb o n d( C y s 2 8 7a n dC y s 3 0 2 )w a sf o u n dn e a ri t s\nterminal end by structural analysis, similar to type I PETase. In\naddition, Tyr62, a hydrophobic residue, plays a critical role in the\nstabilization of the intermediate, and two Ca\n2+ binding sites were\nidenti ﬁed at positions 31 and 37 (site 1 in Cut190) and positions\n158 and 160 (site 3 in Cut190).\n2.2.3 RgPETase\nA novel PET hydrolase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus\n(RgPETase) was identiﬁed (Tm, 48.5°C), which displays almost\nthe same degrading activity against microcrystalline PET but a\nsigniﬁcantly lower activity compared to that ofIsPETase at 30\n°C\n(H. Y. Sagong et al., 2021). Crystal structure analysis indicated that\nRgPETase shares the key structural features ofIsPETase, such as the\ncatalytic triad, substrate binding cleft, extendedβ8-α6 connecting\nloop, and two disulﬁde bonds (Figure 13A), which might lead to\nhigh PET hydrolysis activity. However, RgPETase also displays\nsubstantial structural differences ( Figures 13B –D), including\nvariable region 1 (VR1, Q26-S51), the wobbling tryptophan-\ncontaining loop (WW-loop, W183-S187), variable region 2 (VR2,\nP207-V228) and the C-terminal region (G271-Y292). These special\nstructures might contribute to the different behaviours ofRgPETase\ntoward low-crystalline PET. In particular, the increased activity of\nRgPETase\nK169A and the decreased activity of RgPETaseE186A and\nRgPETaseK169A/E186A showed that the electrostatic charge of the\nWW-loop surface or the whole protein surface of RgPETase\nmight greatly affect its PET-hydrolysing activity.\n2.2.4 SM14est"}

From a total of 52 genomes analysed, 3 potential PETase-like\nenzymes from marine sponge-associatedStreptomyces isolates were\nsuccessfully identi ﬁed, including SM14est from Streptomyces\nsp. SM14. Sequence analysis revealed that the serine hydrolase\nmotif (G-X1-S-X2-G) and the catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His) are\nalso conserved in SM14est. Heterologous expression of SM14est\nwas achieved inE. coliwith the nativeStreptomyces signal peptide,\nwhich was also conﬁrmed to show polyesterase activity by the\npolycaprolactone (PCL) plate clearing assay. With a similar\nmethod, a cascade of BLAST searches was applied to identify\npotential PETases in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) terrestrial\nmetagenome datasets (7,375 samples) (Karunatillaka, Jaroszewski,\nand Godzik, 2022).\n2.2.5 BbPETase\nIn recent studies, a novel PET hydrolase fromBurkholderiales\nbacterium RIFCSPLOWO2_02_FULL_57_36 ( BbPETase) was\nidentiﬁed and characterized with an additional N-terminal\ndomain (BbPETaseAND)( H. Y. Sagong et al., 2022 ; C.C. Chen\nXsy et al., 2021). The Tm values of BbPETaseFull (the full-length\nform) andBbPETaseCD (the N-terminal truncated form) were 54°C\nand 51°C, respectively. These changes might be responsible the\nimproved PET hydrolysis activity of BbPETaseFull, and after\n3 days, this mutant still displayed 3.5-fold (1.9-fold for\nBbPETase\nCD) higher activity than that of wild-type IsPETase at\n40°C. However, it should be noted that although BbPETaseAND\nmight play a role in the improved thermostability ofBbPETase,\nthis domain also showed a detrimental effect on PET hydrolysis.\nEspecially for the low-crystallinity PET ﬁlm, BbPETaseFull and\nBbPETaseCD both exhibited lower activities than IsPETase at\n30°C. This might be caused by BbPETaseAND inhibiting the\nadhesion of PETase binding to the PET surface. Based on these\nﬁndings, the increased thermostability might be caused by the\nadditional N-terminal domain, which led to the improved\ncatalytic activities.\nTo date, the crystal structure of BbPETase\nFull has not been\nreleased, but the detailed structure of BbPETaseCD was obtained\nrecently (PDB ID: 7CWQ,Figure 14)( C.C. Chen et al., 2021). It is\nalmost identical to that ofIsPETase and shares most of the key\nstructural features ofIsPETase, such as the canonicalα/β-hydrolase\nfold and the substrate-binding site. Although the substrate-binding\ncleft was similar, the different residues on the surface led to slightly\ndifferent conformations and surface charge distributions. The L218,\nS220, and T338 residues causedBbPETase\nCD to form aﬂatter and\nmore hydrophobic site, and the S335, M363, and N365 residues\nresulted in a deeper and narrower substrate-binding cleft. The single\nmutants S335N, T338I, M363I, and N365G and the multipoint\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org17\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\nmutant BbPETaseS335N/T338I/M363I/N365G (BbPETaseNIIG) were\nconstructed, and the results showed that the Tm ofBbPETaseNIIG\nwas increased by 9°C and the PET-degrading activity was increased\nby 2.8-fold at 40°C.\nHowever, the crystal structures ofBbPETaseAND or BbPETaseFull\nhave not been obtained; therefore, the detailed interactions between\nBbPETaseAND and BbPETaseCD might be inaccessible. However, it is\ncertain that the two domains could directly interact with each other.\nMoreover, it was shown that S214 and I218 inIsPETase exert a\nmajor inﬂuence on its higher PET-degrading activity at ambient\ntemperature and substrate speciﬁcity, which are associated with\nW185 wobbling andβ6-β7 loopﬂexibility (C.C. Chen et al., 2021).\nSequence analysis revealed that S214 and I218 of IsPETase are\nconsistently replaced by His and Phe, respectively, in the other\nhomologues. This special role was further con ﬁrmed by the\nimproved PET-degrading activities of several IsPETase-like\nenzymes with site-directed mutations of His/Phe residues to Ser/Ile.\nAlthough BbPETase shows similar PET-degrading activity\nagainst microcrystalline PET, it displays higher thermostability\nthan wild IsPETase. Based on detailed structural comparisons\nbetween BbPETase and IsPETase, we generated the\nBbPETase\nS335N/T338I/M363I/N365G variant with enhanced PET-\ndegrading activity and thermal stability. We further revealed that\nBbPETaseAND contributes to the thermal stability of the enzyme\nthrough close contact with the core domain, but the domain might\nhinder the adhesion of the enzyme to the PET substrate.\n2.2.6 PE-H\nA novel polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from the marine bacterium\nPseudomonas aestusnigriwas identiﬁed as belonging to the type IIa\nfamily of PET hydrolytic enzymes determined by sequence\nalignment (Bollinger et al., 2020). Similar to the overall structures\nof wild IsPETase, PE-H (Figure 15) is also characterized by a\ncanonical α/β-fold containing a central twistedβ-sheet composed\nof 9β-strands ﬂanked by 7α-helices. In addition, 2 disulﬁde bonds\nwere identiﬁed in C214-C251 and C285-C302. The main differences\nlie in the following four domains (shown inFigure 15, in dark blue):\nthe loop connecting β3-α2 (DM1), the loop connecting β4-α3\n(DM2) positioned parallel to it, the loop connecting β1-β2\n(DM3), and the loop connecting β6-β7 (DM4). The positioning\nof DM1 and DM2 away from the active site cleft might create more\nspace for substrate binding.\nConsidering the effect of Y250 on stabilizing the active site cleft,\na Y250S mutant was constructed that has a much deeper substrate\nbinding cleft. The results showed a signiﬁcant improvement in the\nPET-degrading activity of PE-HY250S even against the PET bottle,\nwhich led to a 45-fold reduction in the amount of MHET released\nwith the PET bottle as the substrate. Although the crystal structures\nof PE-H and PE-H\nY250S (PDB ID:6SCD) are theﬁrst reported type IIa\nPET hydrolytic enzymes, it would be dif ﬁcult to illustrate the\ndetailed catalytic mechanisms without structures of the ligand‒\nprotein complex.\n2.2.7 Mle046\nAdditionally, in the bacteriumI. sakaiensis, a novel homologue\nof the MHETase, Mle046, was recently identiﬁed (Meyer-Cifuentes\nand Öztürk, 2021). Mle046 is also a mesophilic enzyme that is able to\nrapidly degrade MHET to TPA and, EG at 20°C–40°C. At 30°C, the\nKm and kcat values were determined to be 2,638 ± 797 mM [higher\nthan that of IsMHETase, (7.3 ± 0.6 mM)] and 80.9 ± 15.8 s−1,\nrespectively. This indicates that it has a lower afﬁnity to MHET.\nIn addition to MHET, it could also degrade\n4-(4-hydroxybutoxycarbonyl) benzoic acid (Bte), which displayed\nsimilar catalytic activity (degradation rate, 0.82 mM s\n−1) to that of\nMHET (degradation rate, 0.78 mM s−1). Moreover, Mle046 showed\nsigniﬁcant stability over a broad range of temperatures (10°C–60°C)\nand pH values (6.5–9).\n3 Strategy for improved PET-\nbiodegradation\n3.1 Cell surface display forIsPETase\nIn an interesting study, IsPETase and the corresponding\nanchoring hydrophobin (HFBI, GenBank KU173825) were\nsimultaneously displayed on the yeast cell surface for the efﬁcient\nbiodegradation of highly crystallized PET (hcPET) (Z. Chen, Duan,\net al. 2022b). The hydrophobicity of the yeast cells could be greatly\nincreased by the displayed HFBI, which would then result in the\nobvious attachment of the engineered cells withIsPETase onto the\nPET surface (~2-fold increase in the binding numbers of the\nengineered cells to PET). The results showed that the catalytic\nperformance of the engineered whole-cell biocatalyst was\nprofoundly improved, and hcPET (crystallinity of 45%) was\ndramatically increased by ~328.8-fold compared with wild\nIsPETase at 30\n°C, with a corresponding conversion level for\nhcPET of ~10.9% at 30°C within 10 days.\nThe special catalytic mechanism makes MHETase much more\noperational in the biodegradation of PET waste. In a study,\nengineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the MHETase\nenzyme was used to develop a whole-cell catalyst for ef ﬁcient\nbioconversion of MHET into TPA and, EG ( Loll-Krippleber\net al., 2022). Efﬁcient MHETase expression with different display\npartners on the yeast cell surface was achieved, and MHETase-Aga2\nand MHETase-Sed1 showed the highest displayed fraction protein\nand MHETase-Aga2 displayed the protein abundance (4.8 nM for\n10\n8 cell/mL suspensions). The MHETase whole-cell biocatalysts\nshowed clearly different catalytic activities, and MHETase-Tip1\ndisplayed the highest reaction rate against MpNPT. MHETase-\nTip1 could also efﬁciently hydrolyse MHET, releasing TPA, and\nafter 24 h, all MHET (400 nM) was converted to TPA. However, no\nTPA was catalysed by the intracellular MHETase chimaera even\nafter 24 h, which indicates that MHET was hydrolysed\nextracellularly. However, lower substrate af ﬁnity and catalytic\nefﬁciency (with a 15.7-fold greater k\nm and a 0.68-fold lower kcat)\nwere also observed and concluded to be caused by ectopic\nglycosylation, the special environment of the yeast cell surface, or\nlarge protein fusion. In contrast, the constructed whole-cell catalysts\nwere conﬁrmed to be active for more than 12 days and stay active up\nto 45\n°C.\nRecently, a hydrophobic cell surface display (HCSD) system in\nE. coliwas developed for the construction of an efﬁcient whole-cell\nPET-degrading catalyst (Jia et al., 2022). In this method, the FadL\nprotein was used for the display of PETase; moreover, the\nhydrophobic protein HFBII was displayed on the surface of\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org18\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\nEscherichia colifor increased PET accessibility. The results revealed\nthat the HCSD showed a clear degrading effect on PET, leading to\nmuch rougher surfaces with greater hydrophilicity and a water\ncontact angle of 68.4 ± 1\n°, which was signiﬁcantly lower than\nthat of untreated PET (106.1 ± 2 °). In addition, the HCSD\nsystem displayed satisfactory thermostability and processing\nstability, with 73% activity retained at 40°C for 7 days and 70%\nactivity maintained after 7 cycles. Compared with whole-cell\nimmobilization, the HCSD system exhibits more advantages for\nefﬁcient PET degradation.\nIn addition to the widely used model hostE. coli, Pichia pastoris\n(P. pastoris) has long been considered one of the most versatile\nplatforms for the production of various heterologous proteins,\nincluding industrial enzymes. Recently, a whole-cell biocatalyst\nwas developed by displaying PETase on the surface ofP. pastoris\nto improve the PET-degrading efﬁciency (Z. Chen, Wang, et al.,\n2020b). The results showed that compared with free PETase, the\nobtained whole-cell biocatalyst had enhanced pH and\nthermostability. Moreover, the turnover rate of the whole-cell\nbiocatalyst against hc-PET was signi ﬁcantly improved by ~36-\nfold compared with that of free PETase. In particular, the\ncatalytic performance remained stable after 7 repeated uses, even\nagainst commercial hc-PET bottles.\n3.2 Engineering ofIsPETase through\ndifferent secretory expression systems\nGiven the appearance of abundant N- and O-linked\nglycosylation sites in IsPETase, it is interesting to investigate\nwhether posttranslational glycosylation participates in the\ncatalytic activity and thermostability ofIsPETase. In one study, it\nwas shown that IsPETase could be successfully deglycosylated by\nendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H, EC3.2.1.96), and the\nthermostability of the recombinant protein (IsPETase-Pp) could be\nfurther elevated. The optimal temperature was increased to 50°C\nhigher than that of wildIsPETase; moreover, it retained ~90% of its\ninitial activity after a 2-h incubation at 50°C( Deng et al., 2023). The\npartially deglycosylated IsPETase-Pp (further deglycosylated by\nEndo H after Ni-NTA afﬁnity chromatography puriﬁcation) was\ndetermined to be stable at 40°C with no activity lost after heat\ntreatment for 12 h, and it retained more than 40% of its initial\nactivity at 50\n°C after heat treatment for 6 h. These results\ndemonstrated the higher thermostability of IsPETase-Pp\ncompared to the wild-type IsPETase expressed by E. coli\n(IsPETase-Ec). In addition, the catalytic activity of IsPETase-Pp\nwas further increased by ~3-fold (from 20.6 U/mg to 62.4 U/mg)\nafter deglycosylation, which was also much higher than that of\nIsPETase-Ec (~1.8 U/mg). Structure analysis showed that N-linked\nmodiﬁcation sites were mainly detected at N114, N138, N212,\nN264 and N288 on the loops of the protein surface. After Endo\nH cleavage, the long polysaccharide chains were removed from\nIsPETase-Pp, leaving a GlcNAc residue, which might play critical\nroles in the increased thermostability.\nAlthough it is widely accepted that the covalent binding of glycans\nto the protein surface could further improve the thermostability and\ncatalytic stability of the target protein, the mechanism of the enhanced\nactivity of glycosylated and partially deglycosylatedIsPETase-Pp has not\nbeen clearly elucidated (Shental-Bechor and Levy, 2008). It should be\nnoted that the substrate-binding sites of PET-degrading enzymes are\nusually located on the protein surface, and bulky N-linked glycans\nprobably inhibit the interactions between the substrate and the\nenzymes.\nIn another study (Kosiorowska et al., 2022), it was shown thatY.\nlipolytica could also be used for the efﬁcient heterologous expression\nof IsPETase, and the engineered host was able to degrade PETﬁlm\ndirectly with the release of ~23 mg L\n−1 MHET after 96 h in culture.\nMoreover, the results showed that 1% olive oil addition could greatly\nimprove the PET hydrolysis ef ﬁciency, and the highest\nconcentration of released TPA reached 124 mg L\n−1. It was also\nfound that the addition of 2.5 mM MnSO 4 alone or 1 mM\nCuSO4 alone could signiﬁcantly improve the hydrolysis of PET;\nhowever, no positive effects on the degradation process were\nconﬁrmed when the cultures contained 1 mM and 2.5 mM\nMnSO4, 1 mM CuSO4, and 1% olive oil. Furthermore, it was\nhighlighted that Yarrowia lipolytica was capable of assimilating\nethylene glycol and accumulating TPA with PET powder as the\nsubstrate.\nThe secretion of IsPETase from E. coli has been achieved by\nusing sec-dependent signal peptides (SP), such as the maltose/\nmaltodextrin binding periplasmic protein (SP\nMalE), maltoporin\n(SPLamB)( Seo et al. 2019), and SPPelB (Shi et al. 2021). With\nSPLamB, 6.2 mg of IsPETase per 1 L of culture medium was\nproduced, and ~1.7-fold more secretion ofIsPETase was achieved\nby engineered SPPelB via random mutagenesis. In another study,\nE. coli BL21 (DE3) was also selected for increased secretion of\nIsPETase by SP engineering (L. Cui, Qiu, et al., 2021a). Three SP\nenhancers, B1 (MERACVAV), B2 (MDKACVAV) and B3\n(MAERACVAV), were rationally designed and fused to the\nN-terminus of the widely used SP (PelB, MalE, LamB, and\nOmpA) to mediate the excretion of IsPETase. The results\nrevealed that B1, B2 and B3 could all dramatically promote the\nsecretion ofIsPETase inE. coli, among which SP\nB1PelB displayed the\nstrongest potential. Compared with that of PelB, the excreted\nIsPETase was increased by 62-fold, and the highest concentration\nwas ~650 mg/L when induced by IPTG and L-arabinose. The\nhydrolysis of PET ﬁlm by crude and puriﬁed IsPETase was also\nenhanced after treatment for 42 h, and the released water-soluble\nproducts were 58.3 mg/L and 41.5 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, the\nrelease of water-soluble products ofIsPETase catalysis increased by\n2.7-fold when the PETﬁlm was preincubated with the hydrophobin\nHFBII. This study provided an easy and convenient method for the\nbiodegradation of PET with the widely used hostE. coli.\nIn a similar study, a higher-throughput PETase engineering\nplatform was developed (Zurier and Goddard, 2023), which includes\nsecretory expression andﬂuorescent product detection. First, YebF-\nmediated PETase secretion (N-terminal YebF fusion) enables near-\nparallel expression in microplates, and then, ferric iron oxidation\n(50 mM FeSO\n4 +500 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) of PET-degrading\nproducts results in ﬂuorophores (BHET-OH, MHET-OH, and\nTPA-OH) that enable rapid activity quantiﬁcation. Therefore, it\ncould not only eliminate the lysis and puriﬁcation steps but also\npermit high-throughput screening of potential PETases. With this\nmethod, a library of 54 single point mutations with predicted effects\nwas constructed and screened for positive mutants, which led to a\nsublibrary of 12 single-point mutants displaying signi ﬁcantly\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org19\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\nimproved PET-degrading activity. It was estimated that the\nincreased activities might be caused by the increased overall\nstability through the additional intramolecular interactions. Then,\nthe 12 identiﬁed positive mutants were combined into 57 double\nmutants for the screening of higher PETase activity in the next\nround. This led to the discovery of 9 double mutants showing\nsynergistic effects with signiﬁcantly higher T\nm values. Finally, a\ncombinatorial approach was used to optimize PETase activity with\nthe obtained multimutants for 10 days."}

This clearly demonstrates the practicability of applying this\nhigh-throughput platform for efﬁcient PETase engineering. In a\nsimilar study byK. Liu et al. (2023), a dualﬂuorescence assay was\ndeveloped for high-throughput screening for potential PETases. In\nthis method, mutants areﬁrst expressed in deep 96-well plates as\nfusion proteins with a deep redﬂuorescent protein (mCarmine),\nwhich is bene ﬁcial to the rapid quantitative assay of enzyme\nconcentrations in a 96-well plate (Plate 1). Second, a speciﬁc 96-\nwell plate (Plate 2) was prepared by coating mixed PETﬂuorogenic\nprobes (FPs) on the bottoms of each well. Finally, transferring an\nappropriate amount of crude cell lysate from Plate 1 to Plate\n2 facilitated the degradation of PET along with rapid\ncohydrolysis of freed FP to green ﬂuorescein as an indicator of\nPET hydrolysis, which could then be quantiﬁed and determined.\nWith this method, a library of 2,850 mutants with an average of 1-\n7 amino acid substitutions constructed by error-prone PCR was\nscreened, and the results revealed that through two-round screening,\n6 improved variants with 1.3–4.9-fold improved activities were\nsuccessfully identi ﬁed. Although slightly complicated, this\nscreening strategy provides another practical alternative for the\ndiscovery of potential PETases.\nTo further improve the soluble expression levels for the\nefﬁcient production of IsPETase, cytoplasmic overexpression in\nE. coli was also investigated ( Son et al., 2019 ). In addition,\nstrategies of coexpression with chaperones GroEL/ES and\nN-terminal NusA-tag fused expression were also explored in\nE. coli (Aer et al., 2022 ). The results showed that GroEL/ES\ncould signi ﬁcantly facilitate the overexpression of soluble\nIsPETase\nMut at 25°Ca n d3 0°C, with the highest improvement\nof ~12.5-fold observed at 25°C. This is also true for the superior\nsoluble expression ability of NusA at 25 °C, with the highest\nincrease in soluble expression reaching ~4.6-fold. Although\nNusA- IsPETase\nMut and IsPETase Mut (GroEL/ES) displayed\nlittle improvement in thermostability, NusA- IsPETase Mut\nshowed an ~ 1.5-fold improvement in enzyme activity at\npH 9.0. After 2 weeks, a 1.4-fold higher release of soluble\nTPA, MHET, and BHET (with a much higher amount of\nMHET) catalysed by NusA- IsPETase\nMut w a so b t a i n e di nt h e\nbiodegradation of PET.\nAs mentioned above, it has been shown that electrostatic\ninteractions play an important role in the protein thermostability\nof PETase. Recently, an electrostatic interaction-based strategy was\ndeveloped for the rational design of IsPETase with improved\ncatalytic performance, especially thermostability. Based on\nstructural analysis, the domains with high B-factor and RMSF\n(with higher ﬂexibility) were selected for site-directed mutations,\nincluding the positions lined with W156-N161 and E245-R251. The\nstrategy consists of three main steps, including the introduction of a\npositive charge (S92R and S92K), the substitution of a negative\ncharge (S92R/K + D157E, I139R/K + D157E), and the introduction\nof the R251A mutation. The results showed that IsPETase\nI139R\ndisplayed the highest thermostability with a Tm value of 56.37°C,\nwhich was suggested to be caused by reasonable electrostatic\ninteraction with a favourable N-O distance (~2.7 Å).\nWhen applied for the biodegradation of high-crystallinity PET\n(hcPET) at 30\n°C, IsPETaseS92R and IsPETaseS92K/R251A displayed\nbetter catalytic performance, and the PET-degrading activities\nwere improved by 1.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. The\nhydrolytic activity of IsPETase\nS92K/R251A was further improved by\n3.6-fold at 40°C. In particular, it was found that the only PET\nhydrolysis product catalysed by IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A was TPA,\nand after 72 h, the TPA yield was increased by 3.02-fold compared\nwith that of the wild type. Additionally, IsPETase\nS92K/R251A and\nIsPETaseI139R displayed distinctly improved thermostability and\nretained over 60% relative activity for 24 h of inactivation at\n40\n°C. Molecular simulations con ﬁrmed that the added\nelectrostatic interaction could ef ﬁciently stabilize the target\nﬂexible region and lead to global structural stabilization.\nEspecially at higher temperatures, this effect becomes more\nsigniﬁcant (Schwaminger et al., 2021).\n3.3 Immobilization of PETase enzymes\nRecently, an interesting bienzymatic cascade system (DuP-\nM@CaP, 1.5 μm) was constructed for the coimmobilization of\nDuraPETase and MHETase throu gh the SpyTag/SpyCatcher\nsystem (K. Chen, Dong, and Sun, 2022c). SpyTag/SpyCatcher\n(Spy) chemistry shows great po tential in multienzymatic\ncascade reactions with improv ed catalytic performance, in\nwhich SpyTag can spontaneously form stable iso-peptide\nbonds with SpyCatcher. In this study, MHETase-SpyCatcher\nwas ﬁrst embedded in calcium phosphate nanocrystals (CaP)\nvia biomimetic mineralization, and then DuraPETase-SpyTag\nwas conjugated on the surf ace. DuP-M@CaP displayed\nsigni ﬁcantly improved thermostability and pH stability; at\n50\n°C, the residual enzyme activity of DuP-M@CaP wase\nmaintained at 87.7% after incubation for 4 h. After 6 days for\nPET degradation, the degrading ef ﬁciencies of DuP-M@CaP\nwere increased by 9.7-fold and 5.2-fold at 40\n°Ca n d5 0°C,\nrespectively, and in a 10-day degradation of PET ﬁlm, 50.3%\nweight losses were achieved at 50°C. As expected, the improved\nstabilities and the speci ﬁc spatial distribution of the\nimmobilized enzymes contribu ted to the superior catalytic\nperformance of DuP-M@CaP.\n3.4 Enhancing PET hydrolytic activity with\nfused functional domains\nThe increased accessibility of PET-degrading enzymes towards\nthe highly hydrophobic surface of PET is also important for rapid\nand efﬁcient PET hydrolysis (C.C. Chen, Dai, et al., 2020a). In\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org20\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\naddition to modulating protein evolution, the strategy of\nconstructing fusion proteins has also been proven to be effective\nin enhancing the binding afﬁnity of enzymes and substrates with\nhydrophobic surface binding modules (D. Ribitsch et al., 2013; D.\nRibitsch et al., 2015; Várnai et al., 2014).\n3.4.1 Carbohydrate-binding module (CBM)-fused\nPETase\nCarbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are small noncatalytic\nprotein domains that usually function as a part of modular enzymes\n(e.g., carbohydrate-active enzymes, CAZymes) and are capable of\nenhancing the binding afﬁnity between enzymes and substrates\n(Armenta et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2019). Consequently, CBMs\nhave been used as efﬁcient afﬁnity tags for protein immobilization\nowing to their high adsorption capacity for solid substrates (Oliveira\net al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020). Based on the topology of the ligand-\nbinding site, CBMs can be classiﬁed into types A, B (endo-type), or C\n(exo-type) (Gilbert, Knox, and Boraston, 2013). Type A CBMs\ndisplay a high binding capacity to crystalline polysaccharides\n(e.g., cellulose and chitin) through hydrophobic interactions\nregulated by conserved aromatic triplets and are therefore\nconsidered potential candidates for PET-binding peptides (Zhang\net al., 2013; Y. Liu, Wang, et al., 2022b).\nJoanna et al. reported the identiﬁcation of a novel PET-binding\nCBM, and the CBM-PET interactions were explored (Weber et al.,\n2019). First, a semiquantitative PET surface af ﬁnity assay was\ndeveloped to detect CBMs bound to PET ﬁlms. Then, eight\nCBMs from the carbohydrate active enzymes database ( http://\nwww.cazy.org/, CAZy database) ( Drula et al., 2022 ) were\nscreened for PET binding, and the results showed thatBaCBM2\n(GenBank accession numbers: ACQ50287/MK349005) possessed\nthe strongest afﬁnity towards PET. Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations were used investigate the CBM-PET interactions and\nidentiﬁed an aromatic triad (Trp9/Trp44/Trp63) on the peptide\nsurface that was also stabilized by π-stacking interactions and\nhydrogen bonds. This was further veri ﬁed by tryptophan\nquenching experiments and alanine point mutations; moreover,\nthe strength of PET binding of CBMs was found to be largely\ndetermined by the ratio of hydrophobic to polar contacts at the\ninterface.\nAndrew et al. investigated the binding ofBaCBM2 for PET in\ndetail and showed that the binding afﬁnity is highly associated with\nthe temperature and crystallinity (Rennison, Westh, and Møller,\n2023). With increasing in tested temperatures, the general trend of\nK\nd increased ﬁrst and then declined. At ~40°C, a maximumKd of\n408 nM forBaCBM2 was detected, showing an obviously lower\nafﬁnity for this PET substrate. At low temperatures, the increased\nbinding afﬁnity might be caused by a gain in entropy caused by\ndehydration of the binding surface; nevertheless, at higher\ntemperatures, it might result from the increase in crystalline\nregions on the PET surface. At 20\n°C, there is a clear trend of\nhigher afﬁnity at higher crystallinity, and a signiﬁcant increase in\nafﬁnity was seen as ~ 20% bulk crystallinity. This indicated that\nBaCBM2 might bind preferentially to crystalline areas on the PET\nsurface. MD studies indicated that the binding is mainly driven by\nthe critical residues W9, W44 and W63 through a gain in entropy\ncaused by the dehydration of the binding surface. In my opinion,\nfusing a polymer-binding module to the PET hydrolase is a\npromising strategy to streamline the enzymatic hydrolysis of\nPET, however the binding capacity, afﬁnity, and thermostability\nshould be improved to satisfy the needs of industrial operation.\nTo improve the PET-degrading capacity ofIsPETase, different\npolymer-binding domains (CBM of cellobiohydrolase I from\nTrichoderma reesei, PBM, and HFB4) were selected and fused to\nthe C-terminus of the IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A (IsPETaseEHA)\nmutant (Dai, Qu, Huang, et al., 2021b). The results demonstrated\nthat CBM fused to IsPETaseEHA showed the most signi ﬁcant\nstimulatory effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET with\n30.7 μM soluble products (TPA and MHET) released, which was\nincreased by ~71.5% at 30\n°C. In contrast, the catalytic activity was\nfound to be strongly inhibited by the fused PBM (poly (3-\nhydroxybutyrate)–binding domain of PHB depolymerase fromR.\npickettii). However, at 40\n°C, only IsPETaseEHA_CBM showed\nimproved catalytic efﬁciency with a total amount of 251.5 μM\nreleased products (increased by ~44.5%). This positive effect was\nreduced by the N-terminus fused protein, which indicates that the\norientation of the substrate binding domain plays a critical role in\nthe catalytic activity of the fused protein.\n3.4.2 Hydrophobin-fused PETase\nIn addition to the CBM, hydrophobins are also believed to\nimprove the catalytic performance of PETase. They are highly\nsurface-active proteins capable of spontaneously self-assembling\nat hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces, which are proven to be\nimportant for interface engineering (Berger and Sallada, 2019).\nPuspitasari et al. investigated the effects of the class I\nhydrophobin RolA from Aspergillus oryzae and HGFI from\nGrifola frondose on PETase-catalysed PET hydrolysis (Puspitasari,\nTsai, and Lee, 2021a). The results showed that PET pretreatment\nwith RolA or HGFI could all accelerate PETase hydrolysis against\nPET with more soluble monomers released. After pretreatment, the\nweight loss of hydrolysed PET increased from ~18% to 34%;\nmoreover, for the HGFI-modiﬁed PET ﬁbre (crystallinity, 38.8%),\nthe weight loss reached 34.56% after 5 days. However, no signiﬁcant\nenhancement was detected when the simultaneous addition of\nhydrophobins with PETase was used for PET degradation. This\nﬁnding was contrary to that obtained with class II hydrophobins\n(Espino-Rammer et al., 2013); therefore, this stimulation effect\ncaused by hydrophobins should be further examined in detail. In\nthe subsequent study, RolA was found to be able to enhance the PET\nhydrolysis of a PET bottle, and the highest weight loss was\ndetermined to be ~26% after 4 days (Puspitasari, Tsai, and Lee,\n2021b).\nIn a recent study, a zwitterionic polypeptide (5 –30 kDa)\nconsisting of alternating-charged glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K)\nresidues was fused to the C-terminus of PETase (X. Chen, 2021). The\nresults highlighted that the lengths of the fusion peptide play a clear\nrole in the PET-degrading performance, and PETase-EK30 (T\nm =\n45.4°C ± 0.21°C) was found to display the highest catalytic activity\n(increased by 11-fold compared with the wild-type PETase) against\nthe highly crystallized PETﬁlms (crystallinity, 45.2%). After 5 days,\nthe concentration of products released by PETase-EK30 at 40\n°C\nagainst AGf-PET was further increased to 303.2μM, 9.4-fold higher\nthan that released by wild-type PETase. Molecular modelling\nrevealed a strengthened structural stability and a more open\nsubstrate-binding pocket of the EKylated PETases. MD\nFrontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org21\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996\nsimulations indicate that the improved catalytic activity might result\nfrom the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids (W185, I208, and\nW159, a more open substrate-binding site), rotation of the benzene\nring of Y87, and a shortened catalytic distance between the labile\ncarbonyl carbon atom of 2PET and the hydroxy oxygen of the\ncatalytic S160 caused by the EKylation. All these are believed to be\nassociated with the enhanced catalytic activity for PET degradation.\nIn addition, the noncatalytic polysaccharide monooxygenase\nwas shown to be capable of binding to relatively ﬂat\npolysaccharide surfaces similar to CBMs ( Hangasky, Detomasi,\nand Marletta, 2019), which might contribute to binding to the\nPET surface. In one study, it was reported that the lytic\npolysaccharide monooxygenase from Pycnoporus coccineus\n(PcAA14A) could also facilitate IsPETase-catalysed PET\ndegradation (Dai, Qu, Hu, et al., 2021a). The results showed that\nPcAA14A alone was unable to degrade PET; however, the PET\ndegradation products were increased to 534 ± 24.3μM when treated\nwith PcAA14A andIsPETase simultaneously, which was increased\nby 59.2% compared with that catalysed byIsPETase alone. Even in\nthe absence of ascorbate and H\n2O2 (necessary for the catalytic\nfunctions of PcAA14A) or with the inactive mutant\nPcAA14A\nH100A, similar ﬁndings could also be obtained with\n588 ± 13.5μM, 490 ± 13.5μM, 490 ± 26.5μM products detected.\nThis reveals the synergistic effects of PcAA14A andIsPETase in PET\nhydrolysis, which might be unrelated to the catalytic activity of\nPcAA14. After 5 days, under the optimal conditions, PET was\ndegraded, releasing 1,097 μM products, which was increased by\n27.7% compared with that produced by IsPETase alone. These\ninteresting ﬁndings provide novel insights into the design of\npromising enzymatic machineries for PET biodegradation."}

Enzymatic\nhydrolysis of PET, as a green and sustainable alternative, has\ncaptured great importance and interest worldwide. This strategy is\nconsidered as an environmentally friendly strategy for the recycling of\npost-consumer PET wastes. While progress on the PET-biodegradation\nhas been made, there are still challenges to overcome in developing\neffective and scalable methods for biodegrading PET. Currently, it is the\nmain challenge to discover and identify potential polymer-active\nenzymes acting on speciﬁc or different fossil-fuel-based plastics in\nnature or by molecular engineeringof the existing enzymes. It is still\nimperative to further improve the thermostability of the used PETases\n(or PETase-like enzymes), which usually function poorly at glassy\ntransition temperature. Though several promising PETase mutants\nhave been reported (e.g., HotPETase, ThermoPETase and\nDuraPETase), molecular engineering of PETases for improved\nstability and PET-degrading activity simultaneously still remains a\nchallenge but a promising strategy.\nBesides, currently the mixed plastic fractions are usually difﬁcult\nto recycle, however the microbial metabolism might open novel\ngrounds with the rapid development of synthetic biology and\nmetabolic engineering. Highly ef ﬁcient microbial cell factories\nwith modi ﬁed genetic circuits would not only provide a\npromising strategy for PET degradation, but enable the polymer\nupcycling. For the upcycling strategy, the hydrolysed fragments or\ndepolymerized monomers (e.g., as, EG, TPA) could then be used as\nsubstrates or carbon sources to produce value-added compounds\nsuch as isoprene and caprolactam. Though promising, it requires a\nsystems-based and multidisciplinary strategy to achieve this\npurpose. In addition, it is necessary to determine, and cope with\nthe factors contributing to the costs of PET-biodegradation, such as\nthe biore ﬁnery processes of the plastic wastes, industrialized\nfermentation and puri ﬁcation of the PET-degrading catalysts,\nprotein engineering for improved catalytic performance and so on.\nAs emphasized in this review, it is believed that effective\nenzymes with enhanced thermostability and degradation\nperformance combined with the rapidly developing synthetic\nbiology and metabolic engineering tools would further streamline\nPET upcycling processes.\nAuthor contributions\nFL: Writing –original draft, Writing –review and editing,\nFunding acquisition.

At the time of writing, there are 127\nPET hydrolases recorded in the PAZy database and on the\norder of 250 total known enzymes to have PET depolymeriza-\ntion activity.\n12\nSignificant efforts have been dedicated to understand and\nengineer these natural enzyme scaffolds to improve their\nperformance under industrially relevant conditions, especially\nto operate at thermophilic temperatures (∼65−70 °C).\n1,13,14\nMechanistic studies of structure and dynamics have revealed\nkey factors influencing enzyme performance, including active\nsite binding, flexibility, and the role of individual amino acids\nin catalysis.\n15−18\nSequence databases and metagenomes have\nbeen mined and clustered for homologs, and ancestral\nsequences “revived” to discover new PET hydrolase scaf-\nfolds.\n9−11,19,20\nFor example, concurrently to this work, Seo et\nal. developed a natural sequence cluster framework that groups\nPET hydrolases by sequence similarity and systematically tests\nrepresentatives from high-performing clusters.\n11\nAdditionally,\nReceived: May 20, 2025\nRevised: August 19, 2025\nAccepted: August 20, 2025\nPublished: September 3, 2025\nResearch Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis\n© 2025 The Authors.

In contrast\nto an HMM search alone, or the clustering approach of Seo et\nal., our work uses iterative, supervised machine learning\npredictors trained on experimental data from the peer-reviewed\nliterature and from our assay to filter candidate sequences, with\na focus on challenging conditions including acid tolerance and\nthermal tolerance. We used high-throughput experimental\ntechniques and an automated liquid handling robot to express\nand purify over 200 enzymes and screen for activity across a\nrange of conditions, including temperature, pH, and substrate\ncrystallinity.\n28\nFrom this screening, we identified 91 novel (115\ntotal) PET hydrolases with diverse activity profiles, including\nsome with pH optima <7, and with activity at or greater than\nLCC-ICCG\n21\nat pH 4.5 on crystalline powder. Of the\ncandidates tested, we achieved a hit rate of 55% active PET\nhydrolase and 22% with activity at pH 4.5. We used these data\nto identify regions of the sequence and surface with potential\nimportance for low pH activity. We further demonstrate that\nmodels trained on all three rounds of data have higher\npredictive accuracy than those that use only literature data or\nour first two rounds, suggesting that future rounds of enzyme\ndiscovery may attain even higher hit rates. We expect that\nthese findings may serve as a foundation for future PET\nhydrolase engineering efforts and enhance sequence mining\nstrategies for enzymes with activities tailored to specific\nconditions.\n■"}

A\nprofile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was constructed from a\nmultiple sequence alignment of 61 experimentally verified PET\nhydrolases identified from PAZy (extracted Sept. 21, 2021).\nMultiple sequence alignment was performed using\nMAFFT.\n12,29\nThe resulting profile HMM was used to search\nagainst three sequence databases: NCBI nonredundant protein\ndatabase, JGI combined hotsprings metagenome database, and\nMGnify.\n30,31\nHMM searches were performed using HMMER\n(v3.2.1) with a bit score threshold of 100 for both the full\nsequence score (-T 100) and domain score (−domT 100).\nThe same thresholds were applied to the inclusion thresholds\n(−incT 100 and − incdomT 100). This initial search retrieved\n10,633 putative PET hydrolase sequences.\n32\nFor round two\nand three, we used a pool of candidates from more sensitive\nsearch using an HMM of 75 PAZy sequences (Mar. 7, 2023)\nand a search bit threshold modified to 160, yielding 8067 hits.\nHMMs are provided on Zenodo.\nCandidate PET hydrolases were prioritized using a\ncombination of machine learning-based activity and property\npredictors. In Round 1, a variational autoencoder (VAE) was\ntrained on aligned candidate sequences to learn a continuous\nlatent representation, followed by a supervised rank-based\npredictor of PET hydrolase activity. In Rounds 2, PET\nhydrolase activity was instead predicted using an ensemble\npredictor, which showed better performance than the Round 1\nmodel. See Zenodo for details. In Round 2 and 3, predicted\nthermostability, PET hydrolase activity, and pH optimum were\nused for multiobjective selection. All property predictors were\nbenchmarked using cross-validation. Candidate filtering\nincluded sequence identity thresholds and clustering to ensure\nnovelty and diversity. Full methods for the models used in\nselection in Round 1−3 are given in Supporting Information\nSection S1.\nProtein Expression and Purification. Selected genes\nwere codon optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized by\nTwist Biosciences, and cloned into a pCDB179 expression\nvector (Addgene #91960, gifted by Christopher Bahl)\ncontaining an N-terminal 10xHis-SUMO fusion. Proteins\nwere expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) using autoinduction\nmedia in 24-deep well plates. Expression, cell lysis, and nickel\naffinity purification were carried out using an OT-2 robotic\nplatform as described previously.\n28\nSUMO tags were cleaved\nusing an in-house His-tagged SUMO protease. Protein\nconcentration was measured using a BCA assay and\nnormalized to 0.1 mg/mL for downstream applications. Full\nexpression and purification protocols are available in\nSupporting Information Section S2.\nThermostability Measurement. Differential scanning\nfluorimetry was performed on a Bio Rad CFX96 Touch\nReal-Time PCR machine. 45 μL of enzyme solution (from 0 to\n0.3 mg/mL after concentration normalization) was combined\nwith 5 μL of 5X Sypro Orange Dye (ThermoFisher Scientific\nS6650) in a PCR plate (Bio-Rad HSP9601), which was then\nsealed (ThermoFisher Scientific 4311971) and the following\nprogram was used: 1. 25 °C: 0:15; 2. 25 °C: 0:31; 3. 25 °C:\n0:15 (+0.3 °C/cycle, ramp 0.3 °C/s); 4.

PET substrates, either amorphous film\n(Goodfellow ES30-FM-000145) or crystalline powder (Good-\nfellow ES30-PD-006031) were loaded into 96 deep-well plates\n(NEST 503501) with 3.5 mg in each well. Amorphous film was\ncut into 0.34 × 0.34 cm and loaded manually. Powder was\ndispensed using the Powdernium Automated Powder Dosing\nSystem (Symyx). 450 μL of buffer solution (prepared at room\ntemperature) was added. The buffers used were 50 mM\nNaCitrate for pH 4.5 and 5.5 and 50 mM NaPhosphate for pH\n6.5 and 7.5. The enzymes were reordered in a fresh plate and\nnormalized to 0.1 mg/mL if necessary. 50 μL of enzyme\nsolution (5 μg) was added to each well with blanks for each pH\ncontaining just the buffer of the enzyme solutions. Aluminum\nheat sealing foil (Azenta 4ti-0535) as well as autoclave tape\naround the foil edges was used to prevent evaporation. Plates\nwere incubated at temperature (40 or 60 °C) for 48 h after\nwhich they were cooled at room temperature for 30 min then\nstored at −20 °C. The amount of aromatic product released\nwas evaluated by using absorbance at 260 and 280 nm on 100\nμL aliquots of the reaction supernatant. Reactions containing\ncrystalline powder were filtered through MultiScreen\nHTS\nGV\nFilter Plates (Millipore MSGVN2210) prior to analysis. The\ncalculation of product was performed as previously de-\nscribed.\n28\nCrystallography. The purified protein was concentrated to\n22 mg/mL and screened through approximately 600\ncrystallization conditions. The best crystals were obtained\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5c03460\nACS Catal. 2025, 15, 16070−16083\n16071\n\nfrom Morpheus screen well A1 (0.06 M Divalents, 0.1 M\nBuffer System 1, 30% Precipitant Mix 1). Crystals were grown\nby sitting drops vapor diffusion at 16 °C using a 1:1 ratio of\nprotein to well solution and grew in approximately 2 weeks.\nCrystals were transferred to a well solution supplemented with\n20% glycerol and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction\ndata was collected at the SSRL BL12−2 beamline using Dectris\nPILATUS EIGER 2XE 16 M PAD detector. The crystals\nbelonged to space group P3\n2\n21 with dimensions a = 87.25 Å,\n87.25 Å, 148.87 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°. There are two\nmonomers in the asymmetric unit. All data were processed\nwith XDS.\n33\nThe structure was solved by molecular\nreplacement using Phaser\n34\nand by using a homology model\ndeveloped from a PETase (PDB code: 8ETY) as the search\nmodels. Multiple rounds of manual model building using\nCoot\n35\nand model building using the Buccaneer\n36\nprogram\nwere needed to successfully complete the model. The\nstructures were refined by using Refmac\n37\nand manually fitted\nusing the Coot program.\nSequence and Structure Analysis. The set of enzymes\nthat exhibited nonzero activity in our assay at any condition\nwere aligned with MUSCLE 5.1 with default parameters.\n38\nThis alignment is provided on Zenodo. The same procedure\nwas used to align active training enzymes for HMMs. To\nidentify determinants of condition-specific activity, we\nperformed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses on\nenzymes with measurable activity. Conservation of physico-\nchemical residue categories was assessed across performance\ngroups using Jalview,\n39\nhighlighting alignment columns\nuniquely conserved under specific conditions (e.g., low pH).\nStructural models were generated via ColabFold\n40\n(mean\npLDDT > 90) and aligned using mTM-align. Surface\nproperties�including electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and\nstickiness�were computed with SURFMAP\n41\nand compared\nbetween groups at each mapped surface location. Additionally,\npredicted pK\na\nvalues of titratable residues were analyzed using\nPROPKA\n42\nSignificance for surface properties an pK\na\nwas\nassessed via Mann−Whitney U tests with p < 0.05. Sequence\npositions prioritized by pretrained model attention (temBER-\nTure, EpHod) were also mapped to the alignment, though not\nused in the analysis of significant factors presented here. A\nmapping of all factors computed as mean differences between\ngroups and the values for individual candidates can be found in\nAppendix B and C\n43,44\nFinally, we clustered additional\nnoncatalytic domains by pairwise similarity, identifying a\ngroup of low-pH-active enzymes harboring a ricin B lectin-like\nmodule.

Note that due to\ndifferences in condition loading in our assay, some conditions\nhave fewer experimental evaluations per split. This allows us to\nprobe the effect of data size on trained models. Due to some\nsplits for some conditions having few or zero active enzymes,\nwe report scores over cross validated predictions as opposed to\ncross validated scores, such that the whole data set for each\ncondition produces the score, however the model that made\neach individual prediction did not see that example during\ntraining. We tested HMMs with further training data by adding\nenzymes with nonzero activity at a particular experimental\ncondition to an initial set of PET hydrolases and computing\nthe score for the same experimental condition. We compared\nthree starting points: HMM-17, HMM-61, and D1-Scraped-\n513. Scores were normalized to each HMM’s score for LCC-\nICCG, to allow HMM scores across data splits to be\ncombined.

A summary of the PET\nhydrolase data we used for this search is summarized in Table\n1. Details for all models and parameters used for searching and\nfiltering candidates can be found in the Methods Section, while\nan overview is given for each round below.\nFor Round 1 (Enzymes DP001-DP098, 94 total), we first\nconstructed a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM-61) using\n61 experimentally verified PET hydrolases from the PAZy\ndatabase.\n12\nDatabase searches using this HMM against MGnify\nand NCBI nonredundant (nr) database identified 10,633\ncandidate sequences, which were filtered to 8081 non-\nredundant sequences.\n30,31\nWe then developed a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) using the selected sequences and trained a\nsupervised linear top model trained on the VAE latent space\nusing 513 sequences with experimental PET-hydrolase activity\nfrom the literature (D1-Scraped-513). A summary of the works\nthat were scraped to produce this data set is given in Table S1.\nWith this approach, we selected 96 novel candidate sequences,\nidentified as the top predictions of the linear model, with less\nthan 90% identity to known PET hydrolases. We moved\nforward with these sequences for expression and experimental\ntesting as described in the next section.\nIn Round 2 (Enzymes TEP001-TEP197, 191 total), we used\na larger HMM with new additions from PAZy (75 total) and\naccepted more remote homologs in the search. We filtered\nthese homologs with three machine learning models trained to\npredict PET hydrolysis activity, thermal stability, and acid\ntolerance, respectively. For PET activity, we developed a new\nmodel, an ensemble of supervised logistic regression and\nunsupervised scores that outperformed the evolutionary VAE\nfrom Round 1 in 5-fold cross-validation on the D-513 scraped\ndata set. Homologs were also scored by a thermal stability\npredictor developed in house, trained on embedding outputs\nfrom the protein language model ProtT5 and melting\ntemperatures from the Meltome Atlas, as well as for acid\ntolerance by EpHod (Figure S1).\n43,48\nTo ensure broad\nexploration, candidates for Round 2 were selected as those\nthat maximized any individual score, or are above the 50th\npercentile for all three, and have less than 90% identity to\nknown PET hydrolases and to each other.\nIn Round 3 (Enzymes ESM001-ESM191, 190 total), we\nincorporated activity data from Round 1 and 2 to create\nsupervised models specifically trained to predict activity and\nmelting temperature from our assay. Several embedding\nmethods were tested, finding that ESM1v mean pool\nembeddings performed best in cross validation (Spearman\ncorrelation of 0.537 against max observed activity) with a ridge\nregressor. Candidates were selected based on the absolute\nvalue of predicted activity of 10 mM product/mg enzyme, > 55\n°C predicted melting temperature, and sequence identity of\n<95% to each other and previously reported PET hydrolases.\nHigh-Throughput Experimentation Characterizes a\nDiverse Set of Active PET Hydrolases. The selected genes\nwere commercially synthesized and cloned into the vector\npCDB179 with an N-terminal His-tag and small ubiquitin-like\nmodifier (SUMO) fusion to the target protein. The plasmids\nwere transformed into chemically competent E. coli and\nexpressed and purified using a HTP, semiautomated platform\ndescribed previously.\n28\nAn Opentrons liquid handling robot\n(OT-2) was used to facilitate the expression and purification in\nmultiwell plates (Figure 1B). Expression occurred in 2 mL\nautoinduction cultures in 24-deep well plates. The cultures\nwere harvested and resuspended in a detergent-based lysis\nbuffer and purified via affinity chromatography using Ni-\ncharged magnetic beads. SUMO protease was added to cleave\nthe target proteins from the magnetic beads, yielding the\ntagless protein into the supernatant. Purified protein\nconcentrations were evaluated using the bicinchoninic acid\n(BCA) assay and wells containing sufficient yields were\nnormalized to 0.1 mg/mL via dilution.

Of these, 221 (47%) successfully purified and\nachieved yields greater than or equal to a 0.1 mg/mL threshold\n(Figure 1C). Those that yielded below threshold (254 total,\n53%) may have failed due to poor expression, poor solubility,\nor incomplete cleavage of the target protein from the magnetic\nbeads. The highest yield reached was approximately 600 μg\nfrom a single well. The average yield of successfully purified\nenzymes was 167 μg or an 84 mg/L titer.\nThe thermostability of the purified enzymes was determined\nusing differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using Sypro\nOrange as an unfolding indicator. Due to the high sensitivity of\nDSF, which requires minimal protein and can measure melting\ntemperatures even below the concentration detection thresh-\nold, all expressed enzymes were evaluated for thermostability\nregardless of recorded yields. In total, 233 enzymes\ndemonstrated measurable melting temperatures (T\nm\n), with\nobservable T\nm\nvalues for some samples with concentrations\nbelow 0.1 mg/mL (Figure 1D). The range of T\nm\nvalues\nobserved was 25.3−82.3 °C and the average T\nm\nfor all samples\nwith measured values was 56.3 °C. A comparison of the\nexpression yield as a function of T\nm\ndid not reveal a strong\ncorrelation (Figure S3).\nSuccessfully purified enzymes were carried forward to\ndetermine their depolymerization activity on PET. Of the\n221 successfully purified enzymes, 212 were tested for activity\nwith several being excluded due to insufficient volume to meet\nthe minimum number of test conditions. We loaded 96-deep\nwell plates with amorphous PET film (aFilm) or crystalline\nPET powder (cryPow), both sourced commercially from\nGoodfellow with reported crystallinities of 4.0 ± 2.0%, and\n39.3 ± 2.0%, respectively.\n9,49,50\nBuffer was added for the pH\nlevels tested as follows: 4.5 (NaCitrate), 5.5 (NaCitrate), 6.5\n(NaPhosphate), 7.5 (NaPhosphate), and 8.5 (glycine). The\nPET solids loading was 3.5 mg in a 0.5 mL reaction (0.7 wt/v\n%). The enzyme was added (5 μg) to reach a final enzyme\nloading of 1.43 mg/g PET. The plates were mixed briefly via\nshaking, heat sealed with foil, and incubated at either 40 or 60\n°C without shaking for 48 h.\n51\nEnzymes were grouped by yield to determine the number of\nconditions possible to test. Those with high enough yields\nwere tested in 32 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 2 PET\nsubstrates, in duplicate) (Figure 2A). Enzymes yielding less\nwere tested in 8 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 1 PET\nsubstrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2B) and those with the lowest\nyields were tested in 4 conditions (4 pHs, 1 temperature (40\n°C), 1 PET substrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2C). In Round 1, the\npH levels tested were 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. In later rounds,\nlower pHs were targeted and the values tested were 4.5, 5.5,\n6.5, and 7.5. The assays were analyzed using ultraviolet−visible\n(UV−Vis) spectroscopy of the aromatic products released:\nTPA, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and\nbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET).\n28,52\nOverall, 115 active enzymes were identified, or 54% of the\n212 tested. Activity was defined as an aromatic absorbance\nreading at 260 nm of 0.05 above the blank in at least 1\ncondition. The number of active enzymes in different\ncondition categories is given in Table 2. Figure 2A−C displays\nthe 58 most active enzymes with activity in at least 1 condition\nabove 25 μmol product/mg enzyme. The activity profiles for\nall active enzymes are shown in Figures S4−S6, as well as a\ncomparison to a benchmark enzyme, LCC-ICCG, which was\nincluded as a positive control in all assay plates.\n21\nCompared to\nLCC-ICCG, an engineered PET hydrolase with very high\nactivity on amorphous film at high temperatures but limited\nactivity at low pH conditions,\n21\nthe active enzymes identified\nin this study display moderate to low activity near LCC-\nICCG’s optimal conditions. However, several showed superior\nperformance at the challenging pH 4.5 condition, which we\ntargeted for increased industrial relevance. Despite their\ncomparable or superior performance to the benchmark at\nlow pH, we anticipate that further engineering will be required\nto achieve activity levels sufficient for meaningful bioreactor\nstudies. For PET hydrolases identified here that were tested on\nboth substrates, they appear in most cases to be more active on\ncrystalline PET powder than amorphous PET film. This\nobservation may be due to the increased surface area, different\nsurface properties, and availability of initial and easily cleavable\nnoncrystalline regions in the powder versus the film.\nOur iterative machine learning approach led to notable\nperformance improvements across successive rounds, as\nreflected in increased hit rates for activity in any condition\ntested (44% in Round 1 to 67% in round 3), increased hit rates\nfor activity specifically at low pH (crystalline powder pH = 5.5,\n40 °C, 19% in round 1 to 59% in Round 3), and higher average\nthermal stability (52.8 °C in Round 1 to 59.0 °C in Round 3),\nas shown in Figure 2D. Full counts of number of enzymes\ntested and hit rates for all condition sets over each round are\ngiven in Table S2. We note that the interpretation of the hit\nrate for activity in any condition is complicated by the fact that\nnot all enzymes were tested in all conditions. For low pH, the\npronounced improvement in hit rate for Round 3 was likely\ndue to the addition of supervised predictors trained on low-\nnoise assay data from previous rounds, unlike earlier rounds\nwhich relied on globally trained predictors of PET hydrolase\nactivity data from disparate experiments in literature (D1−513-\nscraped). The hit rate increase was more pronounced for\ncrystalline powder activity, for which we tested the most\nhomologues. In Rounds 2 and 3, the hit rate and average T\nm\nincrease is likely due to the addition of dedicated predictors for\nacid tolerance and thermal stability, including EpHod and T\nm\npredictions.\n43\nMany enzymes exhibited higher activity at the\nlower temperature tested (40 °C), likely due to their lower\nFigure 2. continued\nwere tested under every condition.

For\nenzymes with higher thermostability, such as ESM050 (T\nm\n=\n82.3 °C), higher activities were observed at the higher\ntemperature (60 °C). Generally, temperature enhances\ncatalytic rate as long as the enzyme remains stable and active\nat those temperatures. As the median value of T\nm\nin the\nenzymes studied was ∼ 57 °C, it is unsurprising that most\nshowed reduced activity at 60 °C.\nFrom the PET hydrolases that were successfully purified and\nassayed for PET hydrolytic activity, we analyzed the sequence\ndiversity (Figure 3). A phylogenetic tree based on sequence\nsimilarity of all sequences that showed activity along with\npreviously reported PET hydrolases is given in Appendix A,\nwhere many of the sequences tested fall in the phylum\nActinomycetes. A subset of that tree is shown in Figure 3A,\nincluding a few commonly studied PET hydrolases and the\ncandidates that we found with >20 μmol product/mg of\nenzyme conversion at pH 5.5, crystalline powder, 40 °C. We\nadditionally computed a 2D uniform manifold approximation\n(UMAP) based on pairwise negative BLOSUM62 scores\nbetween active PET hydrolases in this study and those from\nprevious studies in Figure 3B.\n9−11\nFigure S7 depicts the space\nof this mapping for each previous study separately. We observe\nthat the PET hydrolases from this work are generally within\nthe manifold of known enzymes, although we saturate some\nareas that previously had few examples. Of the 115 PET\nhydrolases found to be active in this study, 23 were recently\ndescribed by Seo et al.,\n11\nand many but not all of our low pH\nactive candidates fall within the cluster they identified as most\nperformant. In general, candidates with nonzero activity at low\npH appears to congregate. All sequences shared a catalytic\ndomain with the Asp-His-Ser triad within the conserved α/β\nhydrolase fold, as shown by the alignment of Cα atoms for\neach Alphafold2 predicted structure against LCC-ICCG using\nmTm-align (Table S3).\n53\nA subset of enzymes were noted to contain additional\ncarbohydrate binding domains (CBMs), which we labeled with\ndbCAN2.\n54\nInterestingly, those with CBM13 were more likely\nto be active at pH 4.5, with 50% of CBM13 enzymes active in\nthis condition compared to 17% of all tested enzymes active in\nthis condition. These CBM13-containing enzymes are likely\ncomponents of enzyme cocktails for the interaction with or\nbreakdown of natural polyesters, such as cutin and suberin\nfound in proximity to carbohydrates, for example in the plant\ncell wall.\n55\nThese are marked with squares in Figure 3A,B\nwhere they occupy a single branch on the tree (outlined) and\ncluster in 2D sequence space, based solely on the tree\ncalculation using only the catalytic domain. A subcluster of the\nCBM13 domain, labeled CBM13(Sub) and annotated as ricin\nB lectin, had an even higher hit rate at pH 4.5 with 11 out of\n13 enzymes active (85%) as shown in Figure S8. The\nmechanism of this trend is unclear, but it may be influenced\nby evolutionary pressures on the CBM being coupled to other\nproperties that contribute to pH tolerance. While acknowl-\nedging that the enzymes explored here are not the entirety of\nknown sequence space, in conjunction with PET hydrolase\nsearches in the literature to date, our findings suggest that\nmoderate PET hydrolysis activity is prevalent across enzyme\nclasses and considerable sequence distances. This is consistent\nwith the hypothesis of diverse promiscuity for this substrate.\nTo provide a basis for structural investigations, we selected\nthe most performant enzymes from our Round 1 candidates\nthat also expressed well in the small-scale experiments.\nExpression of these enzymes was scaled-up, and one enzyme,\nDP043 from Actinoplanes sp. DH11, was successfully crystal-\nlized, with the crystal structure being determined using\nmolecular replacement (Table S4 and Figure S9A). The\ncrystal structure aligns closely with other known PET\nhydrolases with an all-atom RMSD of 0.827 Å from LCC-\nICCG (PDB: 6THT) and 0.512 Å from the Alphafold\nstructure of its closest identified homologue in the HMM\nsearch, enzyme 407 from Erickson et al. (Figure S9B).\n9\nWhile\nmultiple AlphaFold models have been shown to closely\ncorrelate with independent crystallographic models of these\ncompact α/β folds,\n9\nwe wanted to validate this here. Alignment\nof the DP043 AlphaFold3 and crystallographic models shows\nclose alignment, including side chains, with an all-atom RMSD\nof only 0.266 Å and accurate prediction via Alphafold3 of the\nlocation of the Ca\n2+\nion observed in the crystal structure\n(Figure S9C). The crystal structure revealed a Ca\n2+\nion, a\nfeature known in other PET hydrolases which has been\ntargeted for rational engineering due to its role in stabilizing\nFigure 3.

The Ca\n2+\nin the crystal structure of DP043 was not\nlocated in the same position as observed in the engineered\nexamples, such as LCC and TfCut2 (Figure S9D) and further\nstudies would be required to evaluate if the Ca\n2+\nin DP043\nserves a similar purpose.\nSequence and Surface Properties Associated with\nLow pH Activity. Using the activity data collected at multiple\npH conditions, we explored differences between enzymes\nactive at low pH and those active only at higher pH levels. We\nsplit the enzymes into those two groups with 35 active at low\npH (pH 4.5) and 57 active only at higher pHs to evaluate\ndifferences in sequence conservation, predicted pK\na\n, and\nsurface properties. For each residue in the alignment of all\nsequences, we determined any statistically significant (p <\n0.05) differences for these properties (conservation, pK\na\n,\nelectrostatics, hydrophobicity, circular variance), with further\ndetails provided in the Methods. Table S5 contains all\nsignificant factors identified mapped back to LCC-ICCG and\nthe alignment of all active sequences. Appendix B shows per-\nresidue distributions of each property where a significant\ndifference between performance groups was found.\nFor each candidate, we counted how many of these\nsignificant factors were observed and compared that number\nto its activity at pH 4.5 in Figure 4A, where we see a Spearman\ncorrelation of 0.53 (p < 0.05). Looking specifically at amino\nacid conservation, we found 9 sequence positions that were\nmore conserved for enzymes with low pH activity than for\nthose with only neutral activity (Figure 4B). The distribution\nof amino acids at these positions is given in Appendix B.\nSignificant differences were also observed for hydrophobicity,\nmeasured using the Kyte-Doolittle method.\n56\nMost of the\nsurface tended to be more hydrophobic for low pH active\ncandidates than neutral activity, seen in Figure 4C, where we\nshow the average shift. This trend is exacerbated near the\nsubstrate binding site such as A62, V177 and I208 on LCC-\nICCG which each had a shift of 1.0 units or more for low pH\nactive enzymes. The observed properties for two enzymes with\npH optima <6, ESM065 (which showed equivalent activity to\nLCC-ICCG at pH 4.5) and ESM091 are given in Figure 4D,E.\nBoth exhibited more factors that were associated with low pH\nactivity than the average for inactive candidates, have >6 out of\n9 of the conserved residues identified, and have a hydrophobic\nregion near the binding site. Mappings of all properties where\ndifferences are found and the observed properties for all\ncandidates are shown in Appendix C. It is important to note\nthat these trends are not absolute; for instance, although low\nFigure 4. Significant sequence and surface properties associated with low pH activity.

Of all\nfactors found to be significant when comparing these groups, those exhibited by ESM065 (if the ESM065 value is closer to the acid tolerant mean)\nare marked. Larger and brighter regions of the protein backbone indicate more factors (max 6). Middle: Residues that tended to be conserved for\nacid tolerance that we observed in ESM095 (6 out of 9). Right: hydrophobicity for ESM095, only colored for positions that where significant\ndifferences were found.

Further testing with, for example,\nadsorption assays may help elucidate mechanistic interpreta-\ntions for these identified correlations.\nWe additionally identified 13 positions in the catalytic\ndomain with significantly different predicted pK\na\ns between\nenzymes active at low pH (4.5 and 5.5) compared to those\nwith activity only at higher pH (6.5, 7.5, 8.5), five of which\noccur in or in close proximity to the catalytic triad, as shown in\nFigure 5. For the low pH active enzymes, on average the\ncatalytic histidine exhibited a negative shift of −0.37 pK\na\n,\nsuggesting more deprotonation at low pH for acid tolerant\ncandidates, potentially facilitating an easier proton transfer\nfrom serine as it attacks the substrate nucleophile. The trend\nfor the catalytic aspartate was an increase in average pK\na\nby\n0.26, which differs from findings for serine proteases with a\nsimilar mechanism where it is suggested that the deprotonated\naspartate helps position the histidine.\n42,58\nIt is possible that this\nis impacted by or offset by a number of other observations.\nFirst, the downstream residue from serine is a histidine in 94%\nof active enzymes (position 300 in the multiple sequence\nalignment), and when histidine it exhibits a large positive\npredicted pK\na\nshift of 1.5 for acid tolerant candidates. This\nhistidine may be serving a similar purpose to the catalytic\naspartate from the opposite side and protonation state. We also\nnote three other residues within 15 Å (using the TEP109\npredicted structure) of the catalytic histidine that are\nfrequently charged in the PET hydrolases studied here.\nGiven that electrostatic potential scales inversely with distance,\nthese positions likely contribute to the pK\na\nof active site\nresidues. The residue directly downstream of the catalytic\nhistidine (aligned position 383) is aspartate in 80% of acid\ntolerant candidates compared to 13% in neutral active\ncandidates. All enzymes with pH optima <6 have this aspartate.\nThere is also a position about 9 Å from the active site (aligned\nposition 224), and in close proximity to H300, that is leucine\nand uncharged in 94% of examples. The only exceptions are\nTEP109 (the top performer at pH 4.5), two other enzymes\nwith activity comparable to LCC-ICCG at pH 4.5, and another\ntwo that were acid tolerant that have a charged glutamic acid in\nthis position. It is possible that this glutamic acid (Glu224) is\ncontributing to the positive shift of His300 and cascading to\nthe negative shift of the catalytic proton transferring\nhistidine.\n59\nFinally, alignment position 378, about 14 Å away\nis nearly always glutamic acid for active candidates, except in a\nfew examples, 4 out of 5 being acid tolerant, and including\nTEP109 where it is an uncharged glutamine. A depiction of the\nactive site of TEP109, which exhibits all these features and\ndemonstrated the highest activity at pH 4.5 is given in Figure\n5. Further testing, such as with a mutational scan, may establish\ncausation to the pK\na\ncorrelations identified in this data set.\nPET Homolog Activity Predictors Applied to Sub-\nstrate, pH, and Temperature. We next used our data to\nprobe the ability of HMMs and supervised activity predictors\nlike those used in experimental Rounds 1−3 as a function of\ncondition and data set size. First, we tested three different\nHMMs (the “starting” HMMs) for their ability to distinguish\nactive from nonactive candidates measured by area under the\nreceiver operator curve (AUROC): HMM-17, which was used\nin the search in Erickson et al., HMM-61, which was used for\nthe Round 1 search in this work, and an alignment of D1−513-\nScraped, the largest set of known active PETases at the time.\nResults for select conditions are shown for in Table 3 below.\nWe observed that performance varied across conditions and\nwas sensitive to the PET hydrolases included in the search\nHMM, with values ranging from worse than random (<0.5) to\n>0.85 (Table S6). We found that HMM-17, which included\nmostly thermally stable PET hydrolases tested on amorphous\nand analog substrates tended to outperform the HMMs with\nlarger sets of active PET hydrolases from the literature,\nparticularly for high temperature activity on amorphous film.\nPerformance of all HMMs is no better than random for\ncrystalline powder and acidic conditions.\nWe further looked to investigate the utility of our data\ncollected across different conditions (in this study, various\nFigure 5. Residues in or near the active site with statistically\nsignificantly different predicted pK\na\nvalues between examples with low\npH activity and those with activity at higher pH, mapped to the\nstructure of TEP109. All residue positions are given relative to the\nMSA alignment. The difference in predicted pK\na\nmean values between\nthose groups where it was found to be statistically significant is given\nin the third row. These include the proton transferring histidine\n(H384, teal), catalytic aspartate (D352, pink), and a histidine (H300,\norange) directly adjacent to the catalytic serine (S301, purple). Three\nother residues within 15 Å that are often or sometimes charged are\nhighlighted (alignment positions: E224 (green), D383 (black), Q378\n(yellow)). AlphaFold3 prediction was used to “dock” a trimer of PET\n(blue), and all distances (Å) shown use the TEP109 predicted\nstructure.\n57\nTEP109 is the top performing candidate at pH 4.5 and\none of a very small number to exhibit E224 and an uncharged amino\nacid at alignment position 378.\nTable 3.

First, we tested “tuning” the HMMs by adding\ncandidates that exhibited activity at the target condition,\ntesting in 5-fold cross validation. We were able to increase\nperformance by more than 0.05 AUROC for multiple\nconditions by tuning HMMs with data from our assay. The\neffect of tuning each HMM across conditions is shown in\nFigure S10. Notably, HMM-17 exhibited a pronounced\nimprovement compared to the larger HMMs, which were\nsaturated with PET hydrolases not necessarily active under the\ncondition of interest. These results suggest that HMM searches\ncould benefit from using a smaller, more targeted set of\nenzymes tested at the specific condition, rather than\nconstructing large alignments based on data collected across\nvarying conditions.\nNext, we used the data collected in this study to train\nsupervised models, like the activity predictor used in Round 3,\nin cross validation for each condition. We compared the\nperformance of these models against HMM-17, tuned HMM-\n17, and the supervised model trained on literature data and\nused in Round 2. Figure 6A and Table S7 show the\nperformance of all models for conditions where at least 10\nactive enzymes were found. Other conditions are not included\nas not enough data were available. In general, we see that for\nconditions where we collected more data (cryPow, 40 °C, pH\n4.5−7.5), the tuned and supervised models performed better\n(at least 0.1 AUROC increase) compared to the starting\nHMM-17 or the Round 2 supervised predictor (“lit.\nsupervised”). Furthermore, supervised training consistently\noutperformed HMM tuning. For some conditions, (such as\ncryPow and pH < 6), HMM-17 performs no better than\nrandom; however, the condition-specific supervised models\ncan salvage AUROC of up to 0.8. There is a clear decrease in\nsupervised model performance for conditions where fewer\nenzymes were tested, with some instances where performance\nwas lower than the starting HMMs. These results suggest that\nfor mining enzyme sequences for specific activities, exper-\nimental measurements at a condition of interest for a starting\nset of homologs should be used to evaluate supervised\nperformance compared to the HMM. Once supervised\nperformance is greater than the HMM alone, such predictors\nshould be used to filter searches in a feedback loop.\nFinally, we investigated whether these supervised models\nhad the potential to improve hit rates if applied to search for\nnovel enzyme candidates by evaluating their performance on\nthe existing data set. Figure 6B presents the model predictions\ncompared to observed activity in cross-validation for\nconditions with high-performing models (cryPow, 40 °C,\n4.5−7.5). Figure S11 shows performance for all models. We set\nthe decision boundary at the default threshold of 0.5, with\nthose enzymes classified higher predicted as “active” and lower\npredicted as “inactive”. We observed for each condition a high\nprecision score (the proportion of true positive predictions out\nof all positive predictions made by the model) of >75%.\nSpecifically, for cryPow, 40 °C, pH 5.5, the precision score was\n75%, which represents a putative increase in hit rate of +25%\nfrom the observed hit rate in Round 3, which used fewer\ntraining data and did not distinguish between conditions, and\n+55% compared to Round 1, which did not use condition-\nspecific assay data (Figure 2D). The results indicate that\nsupervised models have strong potential for identifying\nhomologues while minimizing the screening of inactive\nenzymes.\n■"}

To better understand the mechanism\nof PET hydrolysis, we performed MD simulations of PES-H1\nin complex with a modeled oligomer consisting of three\nrepeating PET units (3PET) (Figure S3C) to resemble the\nbinding of a longer polymer segment. PES-H1 remained stable\nin MD simulations at a time scale of 100 ns as indicated by the\nsteady low backbone RMSD of less than 1 Å compared to the\ncrystal structure (Figure S2). The modeled PES-H1-3PET\ncomplex corresponds to a productive state with short distances\nbetween the oxyanion hole amides and the central 3PET\ncarbonyl oxygen atom (2.32 and 1.80 Å), and between the\ncarbonyl carbon of an ester in 3PET and the side chain oxygen\nof the catalytic S130 (2.32 Å). Unfluctuating distances of the\n3PET carbonyl carbons to the catalytic S130 verified the\nproductive state of the modeled oligomer during three\nindependent 100 ns MD simulations (Figure S3). Nonetheless,\n3PET was slightly flexible in the PES-H1 binding site (Figure\nS3A). To identify the most favorable 3PET binding modes, we\nconcatenated the trajectories and clustered the 3PET\nFigure 3.

The four most populated clusters correspond\nto the four preferred binding modes, each including >5% of all\nligand conformations (Figure S4). Cluster 1 represents the\n3PET binding mode adopted in about 28% of the\nconformations (Table S4, Figure S4C). After superimposing\nthe PES-H1 (PDB code: 7CUV) and LCC ICCG S165A\nstructures (PDB code: 7VVE), the central PET unit of cluster\n1 and the MHET overlap well with an RMSD of 2.95 Å, while\nthe binding mode of cluster 3 (found in about 8% of all\nconformations) deviates the most from that of MHET, with an\nRMSD of 4.01 Å (Figure S4D). This suggests that being\nadjacent to S130 results in multiple beneficial interactions\nbetween PET and the surrounding residues. Evaluating the\ninteraction energies of the four binding poses demonstrated\nthat hydrophobic Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between the\nside chains and the central 3PET unit had a predominant\ninfluence on binding. F62, W155, and I178 formed strong LJ\ninteractions (<−10 kJ mol\n−1\n), in agreement with their close\ninteractions with soaked MHETA ligands (Figure 2B−D,F,G).\nH208 and M131 also formed strong LJ interactions (<−7 kJ\nmol\n−1\n) (Figures 1 and 3; Figure S4C). Additionally, T63, A64,\nand L209 mediate strong LJ interactions (<−7 kJ mol\n−1\n) with\nall three units of 3PET. The side chains of F62 and W155 form\nstable aromatic interactions with the aromatic rings of 3PET.\nThe orientation of the TPA moieties suggest T-stacking\ninteractions with W155, in agreement with the orientation of\nMHETA bound to PES-H1 (PDB codes: 7W6C\nA\n, 7W6C\nb\n7W6O\nA\n, and 7W6Q\nA\n) and with earlier studies on other PET\nhydrolases.\n12,23\nFurthermore, the strong LJ interactions with\nF62 are in agreement with the close proximity between\nMHETA and F62. The Coulomb interactions involve fewer\nresidues and are often mediated by backbone atoms of\nresidues, like F62 and M131 from the oxyanion hole, and L92,\nbut can also involve side chains of residues like Q94, H208,\nN212, and the catalytic S130 (<−7 kJ mol\n−1\n). It should be\nemphasized that the significant contributions by L92 and Q94\nare the result of hydrogen bonding with the terminal carboxyl\ngroup of the first PET unit, which should only occur when\nexoscission of polymeric PET substrates takes place. When the\ntotal interaction energy is considered, G61, H129, and T157\nare also identified as strong PET-binding residues (<−7 kJ\nmol\n−1\n).\nEngineering PES-H1 for Improved Thermostability\nand Activity on Amorphous PET Film. Elevated reaction\ntemperatures of up to 75 °C increase polymer chain mobility,\nmaking the amorphous fractions of PET more accessible to\nenzymatic hydrolysis. We investigated enzymatic PET\ndegradation at 72 °C because it is the optimal temperature\nfor the hydrolysis of amorphized PET waste by the reference\nenzyme LCC ICCG.\n5\nEmpirical data have shown that the T\nm\nof a PET hydrolase is usually at least 12 °C higher than its\nT\nopt\n.\n5,11,13,17\nHence, biocatalysts with a T\nm\nover 85 °C are\npreferred for efficient PET degradation. When determined in\nbuffers with low ionic strengths (Table S5), PES-H1 had a T\nm\nof 77.1 °C, as determined by nano differential scanning\nfluorimetry (NanoDSF) and differential scanning calorimetry\n(DSC). This is in agreement with previously published data.\n34\nIn the 1 M potassium phosphate buffer demonstrated by\nprevious studies to be optimal for PET degradation by selected\nenzymes,\n33,34,39\nthe T\nm\nof PES-H1 was increased to 85 °C\nFigure 4. Characterization of PET-hydrolyzing activity of PES-H1 (wt), the L92F/Q94Y and R204C/S250C variants, and LCC ICCG.

The total product was defined as the sum of\nTPA (dark blue), MHET (light blue), and BHET (light gray). Error bars indicate the standard deviation calculated from at least three replicates.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c02275\nACS Catal. 2022, 12, 9790−9800\n9794\n\n(Table S5), thereby enabling its application at 72 °C (Figure\nS5). Because high salt concentrations are not ideal for\nindustrial processes, we investigated the degradation of Gf-\nPET film by PES-H1 in the presence of lower phosphate buffer\nconcentrations (Figure S6). The results demonstrated a\npositive correlation between the buffer concentration and the\nPET degradation performance of wild-type PES-H1 at 72 °C.\nThis is most likely due to the decreased thermostability of\nPES-H1 at lower buffer concentrations (Table S5).\nMany homologous PET hydrolases, including PES-H1 itself,\nhave been found to be stabilized in the presence of Ca\n2+\nions,\nas indicated by increased T\nm\n, improved PET-hydrolyzing\nactivity, or both.\n13,17,18\nCa\n2+\nbinding can be mediated by\nseveral negatively charged residues. For example, D250 and\nE296 in the homologous Cut190 from Saccharomonospora\nviridis were identified by crystallographic investigations to be\ninvolved in Ca\n2+\nbinding (Figure 3B).\n40\nCa\n2+\ncan be\nprecipitated by buffer ions like phosphate and also by the\nPET hydrolysis product terephthalate,\n6,41\nmaking the depend-\nence of PET hydrolase stability on Ca\n2+\nundesirable. This\ndependence can be significantly mitigated by replacing the\nCa\n2+\nbinding residues by a disulfide bridge to generate variants\nthat are thermostable in the absence of Ca\n2+\n.\n5,19,11,17,20−22\nAccordingly, we generated an R204C/S250C variant of PES-\nH1 and confirmed disulfide bond formation using Ellman’s\nreagent (Figure S7). The T\nm\nof this variant was increased by\n6.4 °C (Figure 3L, Table S5). Previous studies reported that\nintroducing disulfide bridges at equivalent positions of\nhomologous PET hydrolases resulted in higher increases in\nT\nm\n(TfCut2, ΔT\nm\n= 24.9 °C; IsPETase, ΔT\nm\n= 22.3 °C; LCC,\nΔT\nm\n= 9.8 °C; Cut190, ΔT\nm\n= 23.1 °C).\n5,17,19,21\nWhile more\nnegatively charged amino acids like D250 and E296 in Cut190\n(Figure 3B), D238 and S283 in LCC (Figure 3C), and D204\nand E253 in TfCut2 (Figure 3D) are frequently observed at\nthese sites, wild-type IsPETase (N204 and S253) and PES-H1\n(R204 and S250, Figure 3A) lack these negatively charged\nresidues. This suggests that the generic thermostabilizing effect\nof an engineered disulfide bridge at this position might be due\nto a variety of interactions rather than just replacing the Ca\n2+\nbinding site. After 24 h at 72 °C, both the wild-type and the\nR204C/S250C variant of PES-H1 hydrolyzed Gf-PET film\n(98% depolymerization) almost completely (Figure 4A).\nRecently, Nakamura et al. reported an R47C/G89C variant\nof the homologous hydrolase PET2 and validated the\nformation of a disulfide bridge by X-ray crystallography.\n22\nCompared to wild-type PET2, the T\nm\nof the R47C/G89C\nvariant of PET2 was increased by 3.1 °C, and its PET\nhydrolysis activity was 1.3-fold higher. We created a R6C/\nS49C variant in an attempt to form an equivalent disulfide\nbridge in PES-H1. This variant was inactive and was therefore\nnot further investigated.\nThe PES-H1 structure (PDB code: 7CUV, Figure 3E) was\ncompared to the thermostabilized DuraPETase (PDB code:\n6KYS, Figure 3F) for identifying additional mutation hotspots.\nUsing Rosetta energy calculations, an L92F/Q94Y variant of\nPES-H1 was constructed based on the L117F/Q119Y\nmutations present in DuraPETase. The L92F/Q94Y variant\nof PES-H1 had a 1.8 °C higher T\nm\nand could almost\ncompletely depolymerize Gf-PET film after 24 h at 72 °C\n(Figures 3L and 4A). Interestingly, the aromatic amino acids\nthat we introduced (L92F/Q94Y) correspond to equivalent\nresidues (F125 and Y127) in LCC ICC.\n5\nInterestingly, LCC\nICC was converted to the more active LCC ICCG by removal\nof the tyrosine residue (Y127G), while introduction of the\nequivalent tyrosine into PES-H1 (Q94Y) in combination with\nL92F resulted in increased activity. The L92F/Q94Y variant of\nPES-H1 outperformed LCC ICCG in the hydrolysis of various\nPET materials under conditions optimal for PES-H1 (Figure\n4A,B). Cui et al. also observed synergistic effects between the\nequivalent L117F (L92F in PES-H1) and Q119Y (Q94Y in\nPES-H1) substitutions.\n26\nThey argued that these aromatic\nresidues interact with other residues (S214, W185, and Y87) to\nform an “aromatic tunnel” that facilitates the binding of PET\nchains to the active site. The hydrophobic nature of the\nmutations enhances noncovalent interactions with the\nsubstrate and improves the overall hydrophobic packing and\nstability of DuraPETase. The same effect could explain the\nincreased activity and stability of the L92F/Q94Y variant of\nPES-H1. We introduced the previously discussed disulfide\nbridge (R204C/S250C) to the L92F/Q94Y variant to generate\nthe L92F/Q94Y/R204C/S250C variant of PES-H1. Although\nthe T\nm\nof this variant was increased by 4.8 °C, it was not\nfurther characterized because it hydrolyzed Gf-PET film less\nefficiently than wild-type PES-H1 (Figure 3L).\nOf the four residues that differ between PES-H1 and PES-\nH2, only L209 is located close to the active site (Figures 1 and\n3G). This site has repeatedly been recognized as an\nengineering hotspot in other homologous PET hydrolases\ndue to its potential interactions with polymeric substrates.\nVariants with increased specific activity on PET have been\ncreated by replacing F at this position with A (TfCut2:\nF208A), W (LCC WCCG: F243W), or I (LCC ICCG: F243I;\nFigure 3I,J).\n5,42\nThe equivalent S of IsPETase (Figure 3K) has\nalso been replaced with F, but an additional W159H\nsubstitution was required for improved PET hydrolysis\nactivity.\n43\nIt was recently shown that exchanging L209 in\nPES-H1 (called PHL7 by Sonnendecker et al.\n34\n) to the F\nfound in PES-H2 (Fig 3G,H) reduced PET hydrolysis activity\nby half. We obtained similar results for the hydrolysis of Gf-\nPET film by the L209F variant of PES-H1 (Figure 3L). We\nsubjected position L209 to saturation mutagenesis and found\nthat most variants (except L209K, L209R, L209E, L209P, and\nL209I) resulted in enhanced thermostability. For the L209W,\nL209F, and L209Y variants, the highest ΔT\nm\nin 50 mM\nphosphate buffer ranged from 3.3 to 3.7 °C (Figure 3L).\nHowever, the PET hydrolysis activities of these variants were\ndecreased by more than 15%. Several earlier studies\n43,44\nsuggested that the S238F substitution (equivalent to L209F in\nPES-H1) in the W159H/S238F variant of IsPETase narrowed\nthe active site cleft, potentially enhancing π-stacking between\nPET and F238. In contrast, Furukawa et al.\n42\nsuggested that\nthe corresponding F of TfCut2 restricts access to lcPET,\nattributing the influence of this residue on catalytic activity to\nside-chain volume rather than hydrophobicity. Therefore, the\nrole of this important residue is still not fully understood, and\nit may play different roles in different PET hydrolases.\nIn addition, we engineered several key residues potentially\ninvolved in strong interactions with PET as indicated by\nstructures of PES-H1 and PES-H2 in complex with PET\nanalogues (Figure 2) and MD simulations (Figure S4). These\ninclude F62 (Figure 2B−D,G), W155 (Figure 2B−D,F,G), and\nI178 (Figure 2E). F62 is part of the oxyanion hole. Except for\nPES-H1, Cut190,\n18\nand Tcur1278,\n45\nother known homologous\nPET hydrolases have a tyrosine at this position. Introducing\nthis tyrosine into PES-H1 (F62Y) lowered the hydrolytic\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c02275\nACS Catal. 2022, 12, 9790−9800\n9795\n\nactivity drastically but had no influence on T\nm\n(Figure 3L).\nThe same effects were observed for the F62A variant.\nThe W155 residue of PES-H1 is equivalent to the W185\nresidue of IsPETase. The W185 of IsPETase (W130 in Figure\n2I due to different residue numbering in the 5XH3 crystal\nstructure) is flexible and can move to open or close access to\nthe active site.\n43\nThis wobbling is beneficial for mesophilic\nPET hydrolases because the PET polymer chain has lower\nchain mobility at ambient temperatures, and a flexible W185\nmay facilitate substrate binding.\n15\nThis dynamic tryptophan is\nconserved in many homologous PET hydrolases and is\ninvolved in strong interactions with the aromatic rings of\nPET. We replaced the W155 of PES-H1 to A, F or H, resulting\nin almost complete loss of activity and considerably reduced\nstability (Figure 3L). Austin et al. reported similarly reduced\nactivity for the equivalent W185A variant of IsPETase.\n43\nIn\ncontrast, the conformation of the corresponding W190 (Figure\n2H) in the thermophilic LCC ICCG is fixed by interactions\nwith H218 and F222 (H184 and F188 in PES-H1, Figure\n2C,D,F). As a result, LCC ICCG has a more rigid substrate-\nbinding groove, yet it still allows PET binding at elevated\ntemperatures as a result of increased polymer chain mobility.\n23\nThe I178 residue is located near the catalytic triad of PES-\nH1 (Figure 2B−D,F). Previous studies have reported\nsubstitutions of this I178 residue in homologous Thermobif ida\nf usca cutinases to smaller residues like S or A, which resulted in\nPET hydrolyzing activities comparable to that of the wild-type\nenzyme.\n46,47\nTherefore, we instead substituted I178 to large\naromatic residues. However, the I178W, I178F, and I178Y\nvariants lost significant PET hydrolysis activity, and their T\nm\ndecreased slightly, suggesting that additional aromatic\ninteractions may hinder productive binding of PET chains.\nTherefore, we did not further investigate the I178 residue of\nPES-H1.\nComparing the Hydrolytic Activity of Selected PES-\nH1 Variants on Different PET Materials. The L92F/Q94Y\nand R204C/S250C variants of PES-H1 were further\ninvestigated using different PET materials. The crystallinity\nof real-world postconsumer PET waste depends on its thermal\nhistory and life cycle.\n6\nTherefore, for biocatalytic recycling at\nthe industrial scale, pretreatment by thermomechanical\namorphization and micronization is essential to provide\nuniformly degradable substrates (in terms of comparable\ncrystallinity, particle size, etc.).\n5,48\nIn this study, we used a\nmelt-quenching technique to amorphize postconsumer PET\nbottles, which were then micronized by various methods.\nCrystallinity of the PET bottle waste was decreased from 27%\nto 19% after melt-quenching and increased again to 33% and\n26%, respectively, after crushing or ball milling (Table S6).\nThe crystallinity values determined with differently micronized\nPET powders are in good agreement with two previous\nstudies.\n48,49\nHowever, the crystallinities of our samples were\nmarkedly higher than that reported by Tournier et al., who\nused other techniques.\n5\nWe determined the average molecular\nmasses of selected PET samples by gel permeation\nchromatography (GPC) and found that values decreased\nafter melt-quenching and micronization (Table S6). Since the\nparticle size can influence the biocatalytic degradability of PET\npowders, it was important to use similarly sized particles for all\nassays. Therefore, we sieved all micronized PET samples using\na 177 μm mesh to obtain more homogeneous powders.\nLCC ICCG and the wild-type PES-H1 were used as\nreference enzymes. The distinct distribution of charged amino\nacids at the surfaces of these two enzymes may explain the\ndifferences in their buffer requirements (Figure S8). Compared\nto PES-H1, LCC ICCG does not lose its thermostability and\nPET degrading activity at a low phosphate buffer concentration\n(100 mM).\n5\nHowever, higher phosphate concentrations (up to\n1 M) do not reduce the PET hydrolysis activity of wild-type\nLCC.\n15,39,50\nSince 1 M phosphate buffer is optimal for the\nactivity and stability of PES-H1 while not negatively\ninfluencing LCC, we used this buffer for all subsequent PET\ndegradation experiments. As shown in Figure 4A, wild-type\nPES-H1 and the L92F/Q94Y variant completely depolymer-\nized Gf-PET film in 24 h at 72 °C. Therefore, we also\ndetermined the weight loss after 12 h of incubation. The\nhighest weight loss of 37.1 mg (62.4%) was obtained with the\nL92F/Q94Y variant, and this was 2.3-fold higher than with\nwild-type PES-H1. The L92F/Q94Y variant also significantly\noutperformed both the R204C/S250C variant and LCC ICCG\nin the hydrolysis of Gf-PET film (Figure 4A). Averaged\nconversion rates of 2.5 mg\nPET\nh\n−1\nand 2.3 mg\nPET\nh\n−1\nwere\nobtained using wild-type PES-H1 and LCC ICCG, respec-\ntively. While the value for PES-H1 is similar to that previously\ndetermined by Sonnendecker et al.,\n34\nthe value for LCC ICCG\nis markedly lower than that reported by Tournier et al.\n5\nAs\nexplained above, this may in part be due to differences between\nthe PET materials used in different studies. Based on the\ninformation provided by the manufacturer, Gf-PET films differ\nconsiderably in terms of crystallinity, thickness, molecular\nmass, and many other polymer parameters, making a direct\ncomparison of data generated in different studies impossible.\n6\nAfter 24 h at 72 °C, the degradation performance of PES-\nH1, L92F/Q94Y, R204C/S250C, and LCC ICCG on low-\ncrystallinity (13%) micronized waste PET powder was\ncomparable to that on Gf-PET film. The L92F/Q94Y variant\nyielded 2.9-fold and 2.2-fold more degradation products than\nwild-type PES-H1 and LCC ICCG, respectively (Figure 4B).\nThis indicated that, under the applied degradation conditions,\nthe L92F/Q94Y variant was the most active lcPET hydrolase.\nThe R204C/S250C variant was as active as the wild-type PES-\nH1 in hydrolyzing lcPET materials (Figure 4A,B). However,\nthe R204C/S250C variant was significantly less active than the\nwild-type against hcPET materials (Figure 4C,D). In contrast,\nthe L92F/Q94Y variant was more active than the wild-type\nPES-H1 against hcPET powders, forming up to 3.4-fold more\ndegradation products (Figure 4D). For hydrolyzing hcPET\npowders (Figure 4C,D) generated by different pretreatment\nmethods, LCC ICCG outperformed all PES-H1 variants and\nyielded up to 4.0-fold more degradation products than the\nL92F/Q94Y variant (Figure 4C,D). While the crystallinities of\nthe crushed and ball-milled PET powders were clearly higher\nthan the degradable threshold value of approximately 20%\nsuggested by Wei et al.\n25\nand Thomsen et al.,\n24\nLCC ICCG\nsurprisingly released more degradation products from these\nsubstrates than from lcPET powder (13% crystallinity) (Figure\n4B−D). By comparison with PES-H1 and its variants, the\nextent of degradation was inversely correlated to the material\ncrystallinity, which is in agreement with previous research on\nusing hydrolases to degrade PET with varying crystallinities.\n6\nIn addition to the crystallinity values obtained by DSC, we\nalso determined the number-average (M\nn\n) and weight-average\n(M\nw\n) molecular masses of the PET powders used for the\nenzymatic degradation experiments (Table S6). The lower M\nn\nvalues determined for the hcPET powders derived from ball-\nmilled and grinder-crushed PET bottle waste than that with\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c02275\nACS Catal. 2022, 12, 9790−9800\n9796\n\nthe grinder-crushed PET film means that the PET bottle\npowders contained significantly shorter polymers (or even\noligomers). When the degradation by PES-H1, its variants, and\nLCC ICCG (Figure 4B−D) is interpreted in terms of the\nmolecular masses of the PET powders, it appears that M\nn\nhad a\nlarger influence on the degradation by LCC ICCG than by\nPES-H1 and its variants. LCC ICCG seems to hydrolyze\nshorter polymers more efficiently, while the degradation by\nPES-H1 and its variants seems to be more influenced by\ncrystallinity. Tournier et al.\n5\nfound that LCC ICCG could not\nefficiently depolymerize the hcPET obtained by their pretreat-\nment methods, but they did not report the molecular masses of\ntheir materials. Therefore, a direct comparison of our data to\nthat reported by Tournier et al.\n5\ncannot be made, but our data\nsuggest that not only crystallinity but also average polymer\nlength may influence the enzymatic degradation of PET. This\nsuggests that crystallinity might be only one of several\nimportant polymer characteristics that influence enzymatic\ndegradation and that polymer properties should be more\nextensively characterized in future studies. The superiority of\nthe L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 in degrading lcPET is\nimportant since industrially amorphized PET waste has\ncrystallinities below 15%.\n5\nThe L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-\nH1 could therefore be investigated as an alternative to LCC\nICCG for PET hydrolysis.\nA heterogeneous kinetic model described by the following\nequation has been widely used for evaluating enzymatic PET\nhydrolysis.\n12,45,46,51−53\nk\nK\n K\nv S\nE\n 1 E\n0 h 0\nA 0\n A 0\n= [ ]\n[ ]\n + [ ]\n(1)\nIn this equation, v\n0\ndescribes the initial reaction rate, k\nh\nthe\nhydrolysis rate constant, [S\n0\n] the initial substrate concen-\ntration, [E\n0\n] the enzyme concentration, and K\nA\nthe adsorption\nequilibrium constant.

The rates of turbidity\nchange measured at 600 nm as a result of PET-NP degradation\nwere determined in a microplate reader at 70 °C (Figures S9\nand S10). The kinetic constants determined according to eq 1\nare summarized in Table 1. The initial reaction velocity v\n0\nwas\ndefined as the turbidity decrease over a reaction time of 40 min\nusing 0.5 mg mL\n−1\nPET-NP (Figure S9). The L92F/Q94Y\nvariant resulted in the highest hydrolysis rate constant (k\nh\n) of\n0.065 mL mg\n−1\nmin\n−1\n, followed by R204C/S250C (0.064 mL\nmg\n−1\nmin\n−1\n), wild-type PES-H1 (0.054 mL mg\n−1\nmin\n−1\n), and\nLCC ICCG (0.048 mL mg\n−1\nmin\n−1\n). The adsorption\nequilibrium constant K\nA\nis a parameter to evaluate the enzyme\naffinity to PET-NP. The R204C/S250C variant had the lowest\naffinity to PET, while the L92F/Q94Y variant had the highest\naffinity, which was 1.8-fold higher than that of wild-type PES-\nH1 and 1.4-fold higher than that of LCC ICCG. The high\naffinity of the L92F/Q94Y variant to PET nanoparticles\ndemonstrates the importance of the adsorption of enzymes to\nthe surface of PET-NP for efficient hydrolysis. The K\nA\nvalues\ndetermined in this study fall in the same range as those\ndetermined for many homologous PET hydrolases by other\nprocedures.\n12,45,46,51,52\nIn general, the kinetic data, depicted in\nTable 1 and Table S7 support the observations made using\nother PET materials (Figure 4A,B). Additionally, we measured\nthe initial hydrolysis rate as a function of the substrate\nconcentration in the range 0−0.5 mg mL\n−1\nusing a constant\nenzyme concentration of 0.7 μM. This enzyme concentration\nwas selected to ensure substrate-saturated conditions (Figure\nS9). The experimental data fit well to the kinetic model\n(Figures S9 and S10), demonstrating that under these\nconditions the model describes the experimental data\naccurately.\n■"}

The crystal structures\nof PES-H1 and PES-H2 were solved at atomic resolutions of\n1.45 Å (PDB code: 7CUV) and 1.56 Å (PDB code: 7W69), in\nthe space groups P2\n1\nand C2, respectively (Figure S1; Tables\nS1 and S2). PES-H1 and PES-H2 differ in only four residues\n(A/E1, L/F209, D/N232, and S/A254), of which only the L/\nF209 residues are in close vicinity to the catalytic triad (Figure\n1). The two hydrolases have similar structures that adopt the\ncanonical α/β-hydrolase fold with a core consisting of nine β-\nsheets and ten α-helices (Figure S1). Comparison of the apo\nstructure of PES-H1 with the structures of other bacterial PET\nhydrolases resulted in low root-mean-square deviation\n(RMSD) values for the protein backbone (Table S3). These\nhighly conserved structures form a distinct subclass of the α/β-\nhydrolase superfamily.\n6\nPES-H1 has a catalytic triad consisting\nof S130, H208, and D176 (Figure 1). The nucleophile S130 is\nlocated within hydrogen bond distance to be polarized by the\nbase H208, which is in turn stabilized by the acid D176. PES-\nH1 forms an intramolecular disulfide bridge like structurally\nsimilar homologous enzymes (e.g., PDB codes: 5XH3, 3VIS,\n4CGI, 4EB0, 4WFJ, and 1JFR). This conserved disulfide\nbridge (C241/C256) connects two loops between the last β-\nsheet (Figure S1).\nBinding Modes of Substrate Analogues and Degra-\ndation Intermediates.

We also solved the\nstructures of PES-H2 in complex with polyethylene glycol\n(PEG) 6000 (PDB code: 7E31) and in complex with bis(2-\nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) (PDB code: 7W66;\nFigure 2G) (Tables S1 and S2). Based on the structures of\nPES-H1 (with bound MHETA) and PES-H2 (with bound\nBHET), six ligand-binding modes were identified. The\norientations of the ligands in the substrate binding cavities\nare distinct but similar to those observed for HEMT bound to\nIsPETase R103G/S131A\n28\n(PDB code: 5XH3; Figure 2I) and\nMHET bound to the S165A variant of LCC ICCG\n23\n(PDB\ncode: 7VVE; Figure 2H).\nWhile the structures of LCC ICCG S165A (PDB code:\n7VVE; Figure 2H) and IsPETase R103G/S131A (PDB code:\n5XH3; Figure 2I) exhibited productive ligand conformations\nwith the ester carbonyl carbons interacting with the oxygen of\nthe catalytic serine residue, the PES-H structures revealed\nmultiple noncatalytic intermediate binding modes (IBMs) with\nthe ester bonds (or amide bond in MHETA) positioned too\nfar from S130 for nucleophilic attack. This supports the\nprevious hypothesis that PET hydrolysis may involve dynamic\nreorientation of polymer chains in the active sites of PET\nhydrolases.\n15,35\nMHET and BHET have frequently been found\nto inhibit enzymatic PET depolymerization.\n36,37\nThe multiple\nIBMs suggest an enhanced residence likelihood of these\ninhibitory degradation intermediates in the substrate-binding\ngroove, where they may prevent productive binding of\npolyester segments.\nThe conformational flexibility of predominantly hydro-\nphobic residues surrounding the active site may help to\nrecognize and bind bulky PET substrates during biocatalysis.\nIn the enzyme−substrate complex structures of LCC ICCG\nS165A (Figure 2H) and IsPETase R103G/S131A (Figure 2I),\nthe aromatic rings of the substrate analogues are T-stacked to\nW190 and W156, respectively. This effect has been proposed\nto be very important for PET binding.\n38\nSimilar π-stacking\ninteractions with the equivalent W155 were discovered in the\nPES-H1 structures 7W6C (Figure 2B, F), 7W6O\nA\n(Figure\n2C), and 7W6Q\nA\n(Figure 2D). In most IBMs of MHETA\nligands (Figure 2B−F), the hydroxyl end of the ethanolamine\nmoiety points away from the catalytic triad. This is partly in\nagreement with the MHET conformation shown in 7VVE\n(Figure 2H), which is different from the position of the\nethylene glycol (EG) moiety of HEMT bound to IsPETase\nR103G/S131A (5XH3; Figure 2I). MHETA ligands also\ninteracted with other hydrophobic residues like F62, I178, and\nL209 in the binding groove of PES-H1. The backbone amide\nNH groups of M131 and F62 form an oxyanion hole, which is\na characteristic shared by many α/β-hydrolases. Terephthalate\n(TPA) moieties in our structures are found in close vicinity to\nF62 (equivalent to Y95 in LCC ICCG S165A and Y58 in\nIsPETase R103G/S131A), rather than close to the catalytic\ntriads as in IsPETase R103G/S131A (Figure 2I) and LCC\nICCG S165A (7VVE\nA\n; Figure 2H). Furthermore, the hydroxyl\nend of the ethanolamine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with\nH184 (Figure 2C,D). The only distinct MHETA binding\nmode in PES-H1 was observed in 7W6O\nB\n(Figure 2E), in\nwhich MHETA is bound at the surface of PES-H1, slightly\noutside the catalytic cavity. This binding mode suggests that\nFigure 2. Comparison of the PET substrate analogue binding modes in the structures of PES-H1, PES-H2, LCC ICCG S165A, and IsPETase\nR103G/S131A.

A major breakthrough in the biodegradation of\npoly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is achieved by using a LCC variant, which\npermits 90% conversion at an industrial level. Despite the achievements, its\napplications have been hampered by the remaining 10% of nonbiodegradable\nPET. Herein, we address current challenges by employing a computational\nstrategy to engineer a hydrolase from the bacterium HR29. The redesigned\nvariant, TurboPETase, outperforms other well-known PET hydrolases. Nearly\ncomplete depolymerization is accomplished in 8 h at a solids loading of\n200 g kg\n−1. Kinetic and structural analysis suggest that the improved perfor-\nmance may be attributed to a moreﬂexible PET-binding groove that facilitates\nthe targeting of more speciﬁc attack sites. Collectively, our results constitute a\nsigniﬁcant advance in understanding and engineering of industrially applic-\nable polyester hydrolases, and provideguidance for further efforts on other\npolymer types.\nSubstantial efforts have been dedicated to discovering and engineer-\ning PET hydrolases over the past two decades, contributing to the\ndevelopment of PET biodegradation from the detection of trace\namounts of released products to the attainment of high conversion\n1– 12.\nWhen combating the challenges posed by enzymatic PET recycling,\nkey parameters should be taken into consideration to attain an eco-\nnomically viable industrial process, in particular solids loading\n(> 150 g kg\n−1) and product yield (> 90%)13– 15. However, almost all studies\nobtain appreciable depolymerization yields at solids loadings lower\nthan 30 g kg\n−1, which is considerably below an industrially relevant\nlevel15. When increasing the solids loading to a high level, a reduction in\nthe hydrolysis rate and conversion is commonly observed (referred to\nas “solids effect”), as demonstrated in other heterogeneous reactions\nsuch as the biomass conversion process\n16.\nA breakthrough was achieved with an engineered LCC variant\n(LCCICCG) that exhibited 90% depolymerization of pretreated PET waste\nat an industrially relevant solids loading (200 g kg−1)17.H o w e v e r ,t h e\n10% nonbiodegradable PET remained and reached a high crystallinity\nlevel of ~30% because of physical aging, hindering immediate reuse for\nPET depolymerization.

Compared to the wild-type enzyme, TurboPETase may be more pro-\nmiscuous due to the increasedﬂexibility along the protein PET-binding groove,\nwhich allows it to attack different surface structures.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45662-9\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:1417 5\nAn in-depth structural analysis also helps us to understand the\nmolecular underpinnings of the performance improvements. Accord-\ning to the model of TurboPETase predicted by AlphaFold247 and sub-\nsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the improved\nperformance of TurboPETase may be attributed to the following key\naspects: improvedﬂexibility of the substrate binding cleft (H218S/\nF222I, W104L and F243T), optimized charge-charge interactions at the\nprotein surface (A209R and D238K), and introduction of a disulﬁde\nbond (A251C-A281C). A209R, D238K, and the disulﬁde bond A251C-\nA281C are suggested to primarily contribute to improving thermo-\nstability while maintaining activity (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11),\nwhereas the enhanced hydrolysis efﬁcacy may be attributed to sub-\nstitutions in proximity to the active sites. H218 is suggested to form an\nintimate packing with the conserved W190 in analogous enzymes.\nChen et al. found that PET hydrolytic activity could beneﬁt from a more\nﬂexible active site in the H214S/F218I double mutant (corresponds to\nH218S/F222I in BhrPETase)\n35. In the present study, MD simulations of\nthe apo form of TurboPETase revealed an expanded rotational free-\ndom of W190 endowed by the H218S/F222I mutation (Supplementary\nFig. 12), which is consistent with the observation of diverse con-\nformations of the corresponding W156 ofIsPETase\n35.W h e nb i n d i n gt o\nthe PET, the wobbling of W190 is curtailed and anchored by theπ-π\ninteractions with the PET substrate. Thisﬂexibility of the PET binding\ncleft was further enhanced by the synergistic interactions conferred by\nthe addition of W104L and F243T, as revealed by the Cα root-mean-\nsquare ﬂuctuation (RMSF) results (Fig.3C). W104 is previously repor-\nted to pack against the adjacent P248 to stabilize the P248-situatedβ8-\nα6l o o p34. In the redesigned TurboPETase, the relinquishment of this\ninteraction by leucine substitution may engender increased con-\nformational malleability within the loop region (N246-A250), as\ndemonstrated by the largely reduced cross-correlation of these\nregions (Supplementary Fig. 13). For another substitution F243T in the\nPET binding cleft, the steric proﬁle of F243 appears to dictate a more\nperipheral binding locus for PET. Yet, its mutation to threonine, armed\nwith a less pronounced steric feature, may release the space for PET\nbinding with a more-ﬂexible state. More importantly, without the steric\nproﬁle of the aromatic ring, T243 may beckon PET deeper into the\ncleft, drawing the substrate’s labile carbonyl closer to the catalytic\nserine, with the interstitial distances contracting from 4.88 ± 0.51 Å to\n4.15 ± 0.37 Å (Supplementary Fig. 14). Concurrently, the enhanced\nﬂexibility might compromise the protein’s stability, which is consistent\nwith the observed decrease in the melting temperatures of the single\npoint mutations. Synthesizing our structural analysis with the kinetic\ndata, we postulated that the greatly increasedﬂexibility along the PET-\nbinding groove may provide more space to accommodate a variety of\nattack conformations through dynamic binding, which may be crucial\nfor the formation of catalytically competent complexes on different\nsurface structures (Fig.3D). Based on the above results, we reasoned\nthat TurboPETase is probably more promiscuous with respect to the\nconformation of the PET strand it attacks. Nevertheless, detailed\nanalysis of the mechanism requires further efforts through more in-\ndepth research.\nPerformance of TurboPETase on alternative substrates and in\ndual-enzyme systems\nPrevious study has demonstrated limited biodegradation efﬁciency of\nIsPETase and its variant towards other semiaromatic polyesters, spe-\nciﬁcally PBT, at 37 °C36. Compared to PET, PBT has a lower glass tran-\nsition temperature (Tg), which ranges between 37 and 55 °C48.I nt h i s\nstudy, even though 65 °C surpasses theTg of PBT, thus signiﬁcantly\nenhancing the mobility of PBT polymer chains, all of the examined\nenzymes exhibited substantially reduced degradation ef ﬁciency\ntowards PBT ﬁlms at 65 °C with respect to the degradation of PET\n(Supplementary Fig. 15). Speciﬁcally, TurboPETase yielded higher\namounts of hydrolytic products (62.6μM) than both BhrPETase\n(27.5μM) and LCC\nICCG (47.1μM). These results suggested that the\nactive sites of current PET-degrading enzymes were less efﬁcient in\nbinding with the extended aliphatic chains in PBT compared to PET.\nConsequently, dedicated efforts in enzyme discovery or tailored\nengineering are still needed for further improving the depolymeriza-\ntion of new classes of semiaromatic polyesters.\nVarious efforts have been made to develop dual enzyme systems\nto remove the intermediate products BHET and MHET\n49– 53, which are\nknown inhibitors of PET hydrolases. Haugwitz et al. reported a dual\nenzyme system combining an engineered TfCa mutant and PETase PM\nenzyme that yielded a 4-fold increase in overall products towards Gf-\nPET ﬁlms compared to PETase PM alone at 45 °C over 24 h\n52.W ef u r t h e r\nexplored the application potential of TurboPETase by coupling it with\nthe recently reported thermostable BHET hydrolyzing enzyme,\nBHETase\n54, in a dual-enzyme system. At a low substrate loading\n(2 g kg−1), the dual-enzyme system effectively doubled the overall yield\nof the products, relative to the singular use of TurboPETase (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 16). However, an intriguing observation emerged at an\nelevated PET loading of 30 g kg\n−1. TurboPETase alone surpassed the\nyields from most enzyme ratios in the dual-enzyme system at 65 °C, the\nonly exception being the 0.5 mg\nTurboPETase/gPET:0.1 mgBHETase/gPET\nratio. Nevertheless, in the current investigation, only degradation of\namorphous PET materials at 65 °C were evaluated. Future research\ncould expand to examine the efﬁcacy of the dual-enzyme system on\ndifferent MHET hydrolases and PET substrates with varying physical\nproperties under diverse reaction conditions, including varied\ntemperatures.\nNearly complete degradation of postconsumer PET products at\nindustrially relevant high-solids loading\nTo better evaluate the depolymerization performance of TurboPETase\nat industrially relevant levels of solids loading, we have compared the\ndepolymerization of pretreated postconsumer coloured-ﬂake PET\n(PcPET) wastes with TurboPETase and LCC\nICCG at a substrate loading of\n200 g kg−1. TurboPETase achieved nearly complete depolymerization\n(98.2%, calculated from the HPLC data) of PcPET wastes in 8 h (Fig.4A),\nwith a maximum production rate of 61.3 ghydrolyzed PETL−1 h−1 (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). A slight change in\nthe crystallinity of PcPET was observed (reaching 11.9% after 8 h),\nwhich allows an immediate reuse of the remaining PcPET waste for\ndepolymerization. In contrast, LCC\nICCG required 16 h to reach 97.7%\ndepolymerization (calculated from the HPLC data) at 65 °C, and the\nremaining PcPET exhibited a similar crystallinity of 11.1%, demon-\nstrating that the“physical aging” process was suppressed at lower\ntemperatures. At the previously reported optimal reaction tempera-\nture of 72 °C, LCC\nICCG reached its maximal conversion of 92.5% (cal-\nculated from the HPLC data) over 12 h, and no further increase was\nobtained after prolonged reaction time due to the higher deform-\nability of PET chains. The remaining PcPET showed a high level of\nTable 1 | Kinetic parameters of TurboPETase, BhrPETase, and\nLCCICCG derived from the inverse Michaelis‒Menten\nexperiments\nParameters invKM (mgenzyme gPET\n−1) invVmax/S (μmol g−1 s−1)\nSubstrate loading\n12 g kg−1 20 g kg−1 30 g kg−1 12 g kg−1 20 g kg−1 30 g kg−1\nTurboPETase 0.67\n(± 0.13)\n0.46\n(± 0.08)\n0.24\n(± 0.03)\n0.081\n(± 0.006)\n0.082\n(± 0.006)\n0.071\n(± 0.002)\nBhrPETase 0.69\n(± 0.16)\n0.40\n(± 0.06)\n0.20\n(± 0.04)\n0.020\n(± 0.002)\n0.022\n(± 0.001)\n0.022\n(± 0.001)\nLCCICCG 0.54\n(± 0.12)\n0.42\n(± 0.07)\n0.23\n(± 0.03)\n0.021\n(± 0.002)\n0.027\n(± 0.001)\n0.023\n(± 0.001)\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45662-9\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:1417 6\ncrystallinity, estimated at 32.5%, which is in accordance with a previous\nreport17.\nMany factors can affect enzymatic attack against the plastics: e.g.,\ncrystallinity, chain mobility, molecular size, surface topography and\nhydrophobicity\n11. Among these, the role of low crystallinity in PET\ndegradation has been extensively studied. A crystallinity exceeding\n20% has been previously proposed to signiﬁcantly impede the enzy-\nmatic degradation process. In the depolymerization of non-melt-\nquenched PET powders (27.6% crystallinity), we found a signiﬁcant\nreduction in degradation performance (Supplementary Fig. 18 and\nSupplementary Table 11). However, during the depolymerization of\npretreated PcPET, even when the crystallinity reached 20% after 4 h of\ndegradation by LCC\nICCG at 72 °C, we did not observe a rapid decline in\ndegradation rate. Pfaff et al. showed that LCCICCG is more efﬁcient in\nhydrolyzing shorter polymers27. Recent studies also demonstrated that\nheavily pretreated PET, with a degree of polymerization (DP) less than\n20 and high crystallinity, can remain highly degradable\n55,56.T h e s e\nﬁndings underscored the importance of factors other than crystallinity\nin enzymatic degradation, and promoted further investigation\nthrough gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, which\nrevealed notably low weight-average (M\nw) and number-average (Mn)\nmolecular masses in PcPET powders compared to non-melt-quenched\nPET powders (Supplementary Table 12). From the GPC results, we\nspeculate that the low molecular weight of pretreated PcPET may\ncontribute to the maintained degradation rate by LCC\nICCG at 72 °C\nduring theﬁrst several reaction hours, but a further increase in crys-\ntallinity to 32.5% led to a substantial reduction in the amorphous\nregions, impeding further enzymatic catalysis. Moreover, during the\ndepolymerization process, we also observed a slight decrease inMw\nand moderate changes inMn, despite achieving over 90% depoly-\nmerization (Fig.4B ) .T h i si sc o n s i s t e n tw i t hp r e v i o u ss t u d i e so nP E T\ndegradation hydrolyzed by Cut19057. It has been suggested that the\nenzymatic hydrolysis of PET typically initiates with an endo-type chain\nscission after the enzyme binds to the PET surface. Further hydrolysis\nof the neighboring ester bonds within the amorphous regions occurs\nthrough an exo-type chain scission, leading to the release of soluble\nproducts\n19. For polymers undergoing random scission, the probability\nof exo-scission inversely correlates with chain length53.F o rP E Tw i t ha\nDP around 200, the probability for exo-scission is substantially less\nthan for endo-scission. In this study, the DP of the pretreated PcPET,\napproximately 50, is much lower than that of typical raw PET materials.\nThis resulted in a signiﬁcantly increased number of chain ends avail-\nable for exo-scissions. Consequently, endo-type scission, which would\nreduce the DP of PET, no longer held a dominant proportion, which\nmay potentially explain the minimal changes in molecular size\nobserved during the PET depolymerization process.\nTo explore the industrial viability, we scaled up the reaction\nand performed it in a 7.5 L bioreactor with a PET loading of 200 g kg\n−1\nin water solution at pH 8.0.

Despite\nthe decreased hydrolytic efﬁciency, the approximately 98% depoly-\nmerization (98.9% calculated from the HPLC data, 98.4% calculated from\nthe consumed NaOH and 97.4% calculated from the weight loss, as listed\nin Supplementary Table 10) achieved within 8 h during the scaled-up\nreaction makes pilot-scale production feasible.

The results\nmay help further knowledge on heterogeneous reaction catalysis and\nshall be beneﬁcial for designing industrial viable plastic-degrading\nenzymes to address the challenges associated with other more abun-\ndant plastics, such as polyurethanes with hydrolysable backbones.\nWhile the potential of enzyme design drives further developments in\nthe improvement of enzyme performance, it is crucial to assess their\ndepolymerization efﬁciency under industrially relevant conditions to\ndemonstrate practical feasibility."}

Twenty grams of pretreated PET powder and 80 mL of\n100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 40 mg of\npuriﬁed enzyme were mixed in a 200 mL bioreactor (Kusnc, Shanghai,\nChina). A magnetic stirrer was utilized to maintain constant agitation at\n300 rpm. The temperature was regulated at 65 °C (or 72 °C for LCC\nICCG)\nby water bath immersion, and the pH was regulated at 8.0 by adding\n4 M NaOH solution. Assays were performed in triplicate and evaluated\naccordingly.\nDuring the reaction, the percentage of PET depolymerization was\nevaluated by analysing the supernatant through HPLC.

To evaluate the proportion of PET in the residue, 200 mg of\nthe dried residue was incubated in 20 mL of 4 M NaOH solution at\n90 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, the amount of released TPA was measured by\nHPLC analysis. The overall weight of the residue solids and the pro-\nportion of PET are shown in Supplementary Table 9.\nEstimating the depolymerization performance of TurboPETase at a\nlarger scale. A total of 0.5 kg pretreated PET powder, 1.9 L of deio-\nnized water and 0.1 L of TurboPETase solution (containing 1 g of pur-\niﬁed enzyme) were combined in a 7.5 L bioreactor (New Brunswick\nScientiﬁc, Edison, NJ, USA). The stirring rate was maintained at\n300 rpm, the temperature was regulated at 65 °C, and the pH was\nregulated at 8.0 by adding 4 M NaOH solution. The percentage of PET\ndepolymerization during the reaction was evaluated according to base\nconsumption. Additionally, theﬁnal depolymerization yield was ver-\niﬁed by analysing the residue (alkaline hydrolysis and HPLC analysis\nmethods were identical to the protocol above), which was collected by\ncentrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min), washed twice with deionized\nwater and dried at 65 °C overnight.\nDetermination of apparent melting temperatures, PET crystal-\nlinity and molecular weights\nTo determine apparent melting temperatures, aﬂuorescence-based\nthermal stability assay was employed. A 5µL1 0 0 - f o l dd i l u t e dS Y P R O\nOrange dye (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA) was added in a\n20 µL protein solution. The mixture was placed in a thin-walled 96-well\nPCR plate, sealed with optical-quality sealing tape. The mixture was\nheated in a CFX 96 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system\n(BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) from 25 to 100 °C at a heating rate of\n1.4 °C/min.

For molecular weight analysis of PET,\ngel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was applied. GPC\nmeasurements were carried out using an Agilent 1260 system (Agilent\n1260, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) with a Refractive Index (RI)\ndetector. The mobile phase consisted of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoro-2-pro-\npanol (HFIP), and the analysis was performed at 35 °C with aﬂow rate\nof 1 mL/min.\nKinetics analysis\nFor PET depolymerisation, initial rate measurements were collected\nfor the\nconvMM andinvMM datasets. For theconvMM dataset, Gf-PETﬁlms\nover a range of 0-50 g kg−1 were treated in 300μLo f1 0 0 m Mp o t a s -\nsium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with enzyme loadings of 0.12μM,\n0.37μMa n d0 . 7 4μM( 1– 6 μg).

Each reaction was conducted in triplicate. Thep-\nnitrophenol products were measured at 405 nm using an Inﬁnite® 200\nPRO microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). One unit of enzyme\nactivity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to convert\n1 μmol of pNPB per min.

The degra-\ndation function of PET hydrolases is thought to preexist as a pro-\nmiscuous function, which then evolves into a primary function\n28,29.\nGiven our limited knowledge of how a sequence encodes catalytic\nfunctions in polymer-degrading enzymes\n30, addressing the challenge\nby exploiting physics-based computational redesign and rational\ndesign approaches is a difﬁcult task. Alternatively, a successful\napproach involves utilizing deep learning models to map the process\nfrom protein sequence to function, as demonstrated in many cases\n31– 33.\nThese models can capture hidden information indicating the\nimprovement in polymer degradation along the evolution trajectory\nfrom the relativeﬁtness of protein variants. To this end, we employed a\nlanguage model trained on two datasets that involved approximately\n26,000 homologous sequences of PET hydrolases across evolution, to\npredict the probability of amino acid variation from the evolutionary\nlandscape (Fig.1A). To select the template enzyme, we compared the\nactivity of LCC, LCC\nICCG, BhrPETase, FastPETase, and HotPETase using\namorphous PETﬁlms (Gf-PET, from the supplier Goodfellow) across a\nrange of temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 2). BhrPETase shares a high\nsequence identity of 94% with LCC, whereas LCC\nICCG represents a var-\niant of LCC characterized by four amino acid substituents (F243I/\nD238C/S283C/Y127G). Both FastPETase and HotPETase are derivatives\nengineered fromIsPETase (Supplementary Fig. 3). At 65 °C, BhrPETase\nand LCCICCG exhibited the highest catalytic performance of all PET\nhydrolases and temperatures tested and were chosen as the inputs. A\nTransformer encoder was used to process input amino acid sequences\nwith absolute position embedding. Residue positions were sorted by\nthe mean of the logits of 19 mutations assigned to the wild type amino\nacid at each position. The top ten amino acid positions with the highest\naverage scores of each model were selected. After duplicated amino\nacid positions were removed, 18 amino acid positions at which the\nwild-type residues ﬁt less well than potential substitutions were\nobtained (Supplementary Table 1).\nAccording to the crystal structures of BhrPETase (PDB code:\n7EOA)a n dL C C\nICCG S165A in complex with MHET (PDB code:7VVE34), 7\nof the 18 generated amino acid positions (W104, H164, M166, W190,\nH191, H218, and F/I243) were suggested to be embedded in a PET-\nbinding groove. Due to the relatively higher thermostability of\nBhrPETase, we subjected the 7 positions on this enzyme to generate 34\nvariants. Chen et al. reported that the Ser214/Ile218 double mutants of\nseveral IsPETase-homologous enzymes showed enhanced PET hydro-\nlysis activity (by at least 1.3-fold) but vastly decreasedT\nm values\n(by approximately 10 °C)35. Since His218 (corresponding to Ser214\nin IsPETase) was involved in our predicted candidates, the hydrolytic\nperformance of the H218S/F222I variant was also explored (Supple-\nmentary Table 2). Among the variants, BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I (referred to\nas BhrPETase M2) resulted in the highest improvements with a 1.7-fold\nincrease in PET-hydrolytic activity at 65 °C, rendering this variant the\nnew template for the second-round accumulation of the mutations at\nthe remaining 6 positions. During the 2nd accumulation stage, only\nmutations at W104 and F243 positions (W104L, W104S, W104H,\nW104G, F243I, F243T, and F243G) on M2 exhibited improved hydro-\nlytic activities (by 10% to 34%), albeit with signiﬁcant decrease in\nthermostability (Supplementary Table 3).\nEmpirical data have suggested that aT\nm 15 °C higher than theTopt\nis necessary for catalyst longevity27. Hence, a PET hydrolase with aTm\nat least over 80 °C is preferred for efﬁcient PET degradation. Notably,\nthe M2 variant exhibited a melting temperature of 85 °C, which was\n11 °C lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The active mutations at\nthe W104 positions on M2 reduced the stability even further, withT\nm\nvalues ranging from 71.5 °C to 75.5 °C. The nonnegligible decrease in\nstability limited further combination, and compensatory mutations\nneeded to be introducedﬁrst to suppress the deleterious effects.\nTherefore, we applied our previously devised GRAPE strategy\n36,w h i c h\nemploys four complementary algorithms, namely, FoldX37 (force ﬁeld\nenergy function), Rosetta_cartesian_ddg38 (forceﬁeld energy function),\nABACUS39 (statistical energy function) and DDD40 (force ﬁeld energy\nfunction), to design stabilizing mutations to compensate and buffer\nthe destabilizing mutations (Fig.1B). Upon experimental validation, 3\nbeneﬁcial variants (A209R, D238K, and A251C-A281C) resulted in\nimproved thermostability without compromising the activity (Sup-\nplementary Table 4). We added the stabilizing variants to the M2 var-\niant using a stepwise combining strategy and resulted in a BhrPETase\nM6 variant (BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C), which exhibited a\nrestored melting temperature of 97 °C without sacriﬁcing activity.\nSubsequently, active mutations at the W104 and F243 positions were\ncombinatorically assembled and accumulated onto the thermostable\nM6 variant, generating 12 new variants (Fig.1C and Supplementary\nTable 5). After a consideration of both depolymerization performance\nand thermostability, the best combination variant, BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I/\nA209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T(referred to as TurboPETase), was selected\nwith aTm of 84 °C and a 3.4-fold improvement in PET-speciﬁc activity\ntowards GF-PETﬁlms compared to wild-type BhrPETase (Fig.1D). In\nindustrial scenarios, enzymatic hydrolysis is typically conducted in\nwater rather than in a dedicated buffered system to simplify down-\nstream processing. Aligned with the industrial preferences, we also\nevaluated the 12 variants under a low buffer concentration. The results\nrevealed that with the exception M6\nW104G/F243T, all variants largely\nretained their degrading activity in 100 mM potassium phosphate\nbuffer (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6).

At 65 °C,\nTurboPETase exhibited the highest overall degradation of all PET\nhydrolases and temperatures tested, releasing 29.66 mM of the pro-\nducts (sum of BHET, MHET, and TPA) in 3 h.

At suboptimal temperatures, TurboPETase\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45662-9\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:1417 2\nconsistently outperformed other PET hydrolases, albeit the decreased\nhydrolytic activity. At the optimal temperature of HotPETase and\nCaPETaseM9 of 60 °C, TurboPETase generated 11.73 mM monomer\nproducts in 3 h, whereas HotPETase and CaPETaseM9 produced\n4.32 mM and 0.60 mM monomers, which were 1.7-, and 18-fold lower\nthan that of TurboPETase. When subjected to 50 °C, TurboPETase\nregistered hydrolytic efﬁciencies exceeding those of FastPETase and\nDepoPETase by 43% and 59%, respectively. In light of the lower enzyme\nconcentrations employed in certain reports, we recalibrated our\nreactions to mirror these conditions to ensure a fairer comparison\n(Fig. 2C– E). Under their reported reaction conditions, the reaction\nrates of LCC\nICCG, HotPETase, and FastPETase were 1.8-, 4.9-, and 1.0-fold\nlower, respectively, than that of TurboPETase. Recently, similar\nexperiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation perfor-\nmance of FastPETase, HotPETase, PES-H1L92F/Q94Y and LCCICCG under\nindustrial conditions41. Their results demonstrated that HotPETase\nexhibited a higher speciﬁc activity compared to PES-H1L92F/Q94Y at a low\nsubstrate loading of 2 g L−1. However, as the substrate concentrations\nincreased to 16.5% (w/w) and 20% (w/w), the PET conversion of Hot-\nPETase were signiﬁcantly lower than those of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y.T h i s\nreduced efﬁciency at higher substrate loadings is suggested to be\nattributed to the limited thermostability and other catalytic properties\nof HotPETase, such as product inhibition. Despite the good perfor-\nmance of PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y under industrially relevant conditions, theﬁnal\ndepolymerization was still lower than that achieved by LCCICCG.G i v e n\nthe reported enhancements of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y in 1 M potassium phos-\nphate buffer, we also compared TurboPETase with PES-H1L92F/Q94Y\nunder elevated buffer concentration, with TurboPETase still out-\npacing, yielding up to 2.5 times the degradation products of PES-H1\nL92F/\nQ94Y at 65 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6). To evaluate the long-time stability\nof TurboPETase, we extended the reaction time. The results demon-\nstrated continuous enzyme performance of TurboPETase at elevated\ntemperatures, as it produced 130 mM of soluble monomer products\nover 12 h at 65 °C, whereas the released products with BhrPETase, LCC,\nLCC\nICCG were substantially lower (Supplementary Fig. 7). The degra-\ndation results highlight the substantially superior hydrolytic\nFig. 1 | Schematic representation of the redesign of PET hydrolases using the\nhybrid computational method.

Adding the\nmutations at the remaining 6 positions to M2 led to active variants with dramati-\ncally decreased stability, and therefore, the GRAPE strategy was employed. The\nstabilizing mutations were combined into M2 and resulted in the thermostable\nvariant M6, which can compensate for the destabilizing mutations in further\naccumulation steps.

As shown in Fig.3A, the curves exhibited\nnear-linear relationships for the initial rate and substrate loading under\nall conditions for TurboPETase, BhrPETase and LCC\nICCG. Conventional\nsaturation behaviour was not observed because even the lowest\nenzyme concentrations used here (0.12μM) were too high for the\nconventional approach to be valid, which indicates the very fast rates\nof dissociation of the enzymes from the PET surface. Additionally, we\nconducted a kinetic comparison for soluble substrates (MHET and\npNPB) as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 7.\nThe catalytic efﬁciency of TurboPETase towards MHET showed only a\nmodest enhancement relative to PET (with a 32% increase), suggesting\nthat there may be other factors, potentially increased adsorption to\nthe surface, contributing to the ampliﬁed degradation efﬁciency of\nPET. Conversely, the slight decrement in TurboPETase’s k\ncat for pNPB,\naccompanied by a reduced binding afﬁnity, inferred potential changes\nin the substrate binding domain, rendering it less conducive for other\nsmall molecule interactions.\nAlthough the hydrolysis of PET could not meet the criteria for the\nconventional approach, the inverse Michaelis‒Menten model was\nmore applicable. The inverse Michaelis‒Menten equation has been\nsuccessfully employed to study the kinetics of heterogeneous\nenzymes such as cellulases, by which the catalytic efﬁcacy against\naccessible attack sites on the polymer surface can be estimated\n42– 45.A s\na typical surface erosion process, enzymatic hydrolysis of PET can\nhardly permeate the inner core of the polymer, resulting in a limited\nnumber of superﬁcial ester bonds (also termed attack sites) being\naccessed even if the enzymes are in great excess. Saturation thus\noccurs when all sites on the surface become occupied, and the excess\nenzyme molecules accumulate in the solvent\n42.

It’s noteworthy that TurboPETase\nexhibited a 2.1-fold increase ininvVmax/massS0 compared with BhrPETase\nand LCCICCG. The inverse parameter, maximal reaction velocity per\navailable reactive site (invVmax/massS0), speciﬁes the rate when all attack\nsites are covered with the enzyme42. Since no substantial differences in\ninvKM and Γmax values were observed among the enzymes, the elevated\ninvVmax/massS0 values may imply a broadened targeting of TurboPETase\ntowards speciﬁc attack sites when the enzymes maintained a stable\noverall adsorption level. Consequently, we presumed that the\nenhanced depolymerization performance of TurboPETase may rely, at\nleast in part, on the enhanced ability to attack a broader spectrum of\nspeciﬁc attack sites that can be hydrolysed to form a productive\ncomplex.\nFig. 3 | Kinetic parameters and structural analysis of TurboPETase.\nA Conventional andB inverse Michaelis‒Menten plots of TurboPETase, BhrPETase,\nand LCCICCG at 65 °C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0.

Interestingly, despite their\nsequence similarities, many of these newly discovered PET hydrolases\nwere found to stem from geographically and ecologically distinct\nhabitats, including extreme environments such as deep-sea hydro-\nthermal vents\n28, glaciers32, and even human saliva metagenomes33,\ncalling into question the hypothesis that PET hydrolases evolved\nnaturally in response to environmental plastic pollution, which has\nonly been present for less than 70 years. It is not surprising that many\nnatural carboxylesterases, found in nearly all organisms, are antici-\npated to exhibit at least minimal hydrolytic activity on the ester\nbonds in PET.\nThe restricted structural diversity of reported PET hydrolases,\nattributable to their close phylogenetic relationships, creates an“echo\nchamber” effect that overrepresents structure-based mechanistic\nstudies toward particular benchmark enzymes. This is evident in\nthe Protein Data Bank (PDB), where out of more than 130 PET\nhydrolase-associated structures, over one-third representIsPETase\nand its variants. Similar redundancy is seen with other benchmark\nenzymes\n9,24,34– 36, with numerous nearly identical apo structures\ndeposited. Instead, co-structures complexed with substrates or ana-\nlogues may yield signiﬁcant insights for semi-rational and artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI)-driven enzyme engineering; nonetheless, they are\nlimited, with less than 16% of PET hydrolase structures in the PDB\nsolved in a substrate (analogue)-bound state\n16. This highlights the\nongoing challenge of obtaining wet-lab data on substrate interactions,\nessential for advancing functional studies and developing more efﬁ-\ncient PET hydrolases.\nAccording to the ESTHER database on α/β-hydrolase fold\nproteins\n37, most PET hydrolases with known structures belong to the\npolyesterase-lipase-cutinase (PLC) family sourced from bacteria27,29.\nThese enzymes can be further classiﬁed into three types (I, IIa, IIb)\nbased on amino acid adoption at speciﬁcs u r f a c es u b s i t e s38.T y p eI\nincludes thermophilic enzymes like LCC23 and those fromThermo-\nbiﬁda species20, while Type IIa is represented by the polyester hydro-\nlase (PE-H) fromPseudomonas aestusnigri39 and Type IIb byIsPETase14.\nFigure 1 shows that, despite their classiﬁcation, these enzymes have a\nhighly conserved core fold with only minor variations from the struc-\nture of LCC, such as an extraα-helical turn due to additional residues.\nArchaeal PET hydrolase from the feruloyl esterase family has key\nstructural similarities with bacterial PLC-family PET hydrolases, but\nwith additionalα-helices ﬂa n k i n gt h ea c t i v es i t e\n40. This partially cov-\nered active site, similar to certain lipase family polyester hydrolases41,\nis expected to limit its access to polymeric substrates. Eliminating\nthese lid-like structures has demonstrated an improvement in PET\nhydrolyzing ability\n41. Fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases possess the\nmost unique structures compared to LCC, with the lowest root-mean-\nsquare deviation (RMSD) value\n42. Although fungal cutinases were\namong theﬁrst recognized effective PET hydrolases43,t h e yr e m a i n e d\nlargely neglected in this research domain until recently when several\nstudies with signiﬁcant polymer degradation performance were\npublished44,45. PET hydrolases with alternative structural folds and\ndistinct active site geometries but considerably low depolymerizing\nactivity were recently discovered using bioinformatics and machine-\nlearning-guided enzyme mining in multiple metagenomic libraries\n27.\nThis study validated the hypothesis that high depolymerization efﬁ-\nciency is likely conﬁned to bacterial PLC-like and fungal cutinase-like\nPET hydrolases. A more recent study signiﬁcantly expanded the range\nof target PET hydrolase sequences by incorporating various blocks\nfrom the ESTHER database, although it remains conﬁned to enzymes\nwith an α/β-hydrolase fold. Landscape proﬁling by sampling a\nsequence cluster framework revealed a collection of highly active\nenzymes, including MiPa-P and KuBu-P, the latter of which can even\ncatalyze PET glycolysis in the presence of highly concentrated ethylene\nglycol (EG)\n29. Still, the top-performing enzymes, KuBu-P (PDB code\n8YTW) and MiPa-P (PDB code 8YTU), have relatively low RMSD values\nPerspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60016-9\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:4684 2\nof 0.94 Å and 0.98 Å to LCC, respectively. Theseﬁndings are compli-\ncating the potential for further engineering of distinct scaffolds for\nindustrial applications.\nAlternatively, emerging AI-driven techniques, such as de novo\nenzyme design\n46, have the potential to generate unique PET hydro-\nlases. In a recent study47,n o v e l ,m o s t l yα-helical hydrolase scaffolds\nwere obtained using a diffusion model coupled with an ensemble\ngeneration method focused on the active site preorganization. Inter-\nestingly, new active serine hydrolase scaffolds have been generated,\neven speciﬁcally designed to catalyze PET hydrolysis. However, dis-\nclosing only kinetic data against an atypical small-molecule substrate is\ninsufﬁcient to assess its realistic PET depolymerization activity.\nAnother study generated a terminally truncated PET hydrolase using\nLCC as a template, with a similar catalytic efﬁciency but markedly\nlower stability than its parental scaffold\n46. The next option for creating\nnovel PET hydrolases is to incorporate the classical hydrolase catalytic\ntriad into structurally stable, non-catalytic proteins\n48. Nonetheless, the\nresulting PET depolymerization activity is signiﬁcantly constrained by\nthe inherent protein architecture, which may hinder effective sub-\nstrate access necessary for interfacial catalysis\n17,49.A l t h o u g ht h e s e\nstudies demonstrated the feasibility of the computational methodol-\nogy, it is yet to be determined whether AI-assisted design can generate\nnovel PET hydrolase scaffolds with overwhelming activity that sur-\npasses the naturally evolvedα/β hydrolase folds.\nFig. 1 | Naturally occurring PET hydrolases and their variants do not deviate\nfrom theα/β-hydrolase core fold.Illustrated are selected bacterial polyesterase-\nlipase-cutinase (PLC)-like27,34,36,136 and fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases42,137,138,\nalongside phylogenetically distinct enzymes from archaea40 and bacteria27,139 with\nminimal depolymerization activity but structural uniqueness.

The crystalline microstructures exhibit signiﬁcant resis-\ntance to the diffusion of water and enzymes, which are essential\nreactants and catalysts for biocatalytic depolymerization,\nrespectively8,51. In contrast, the amorphous PET fractions are sig-\nniﬁcantly more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly when\nenvironmental temperatures reach or exceed the glass transition\ntemperature (T\ng). Shorter segments of amorphous PET undergo con-\nformational changes during the glass transition, which is thought to\nimprove enzyme accessibility and subsequent ester bond hydrolysis\nsigniﬁcantly\n8,50,52.T h eTg of PET under anhydrous conditions has been\ndetermined to range between 65 and 81 °C, depending on the analy-\ntical methods used\n8,53. PET substrates are completely immersed in\nwater during biocatalytic depolymerization, and the resulting water\nplasticization effect can lower the bulkTg of PET by up to 16 °C8,53.\nConsidering the enhanced mobility of surface-located polymer\nchains\n54,t h eTg of the PET surface layer (surfaceTg) may be as low as\n~40 °C53, which explains why signiﬁcant hydrolysis of highly amor-\nphous PET can be observed with mesophilic bacteria likeI. sakaiensis\nunder ambient conditions14.\nMelt-extrusion-based amorphization9,15,36,55– 59 is commonly used\nas theﬁrst step before enzymatic PET decomposition due to the high\ncrystallinity of over 30% in real-world waste PET streams (Fig.2).\nRapidly quenching the hot polymer extrudates in cold water or other\nsolvents is required to achieve a low-crystallinity of ideally less than\n15%, allowing for rapid biocatalytic depolymerization\n50,60,61. Thereafter,\nthe amorphized PET typically undergoes a mechanical size-reduction\nprocess, either via cryogenic grinding or ambient temperature\ncrushing\n9,15,36,57– 59. The increased surface-to-volume ratios are con-\nsidered advantageous for interfacial enzyme accessibility, thereby\nimproving polymer conversion ef ﬁciency. Nevertheless, this\nhypothesis has not consistently held true in several recent studies. The\nsmallest particles with the highest speciﬁcs u r f a c ea r e a( S S A )e x t r a c t e d\nfrom the same micronization batch of low-crystallinity (or amor-\nphized) PET typically exhibited slightly or moderately enhanced initial\nhydrolysis rates, particularly at lower enzyme loading, but signiﬁcantly\nreduced maximum achievable depolymerization extent compared to\nthe larger ones with lower SSA\n55,62,63. The latter phenomenon has been\nascribed to the increased crystallinity, which typically exhibits an\ninverse relationship with particle sizes, caused by strain-induced\ncrystallization during micronization\n36,55,62,64. Larger ground particles\nand precursor amorphous PET materials prior to micronization (either\ngranules from melt-quenching or commercial PETﬁlms) can be enzy-\nmatically depolymerized to comparably high extents after an adequate\nreaction duration. Given the high energy costs and negative environ-\nmental effects associated with the micronization process\n11,12,t h et r a d e -\noffs between fast hydrolysis kinetics using cryomilled plastics and\nprolonged depolymerization with non-ground plastics necessitate\nreassessment in industrial settings. A patent for PET pre-treatment\naimed at enzymatic recycling suggests that using an underwater pel-\nletizer (Fig.2) to produce small pellets under 1 mm could replace the\ncontentious and energy-intensive grinding process\n65.\nPolymer chain scission can occur at each stage of the presently\nperformed thermomechanical pre-treatment of PET waste (Fig.2).\nDespite being an undesirable consequence when a similar melt-\nextrusion process is used for PET mechanical recycling\n66,t h e\ndecreased molecular weights were found to facilitate the subsequent\nenzymatic depolymerization\n36,67. Once PET feedstocks have a number-\naveraged molecular mass (Mn) of less than 10,000 g mol−1, their rapid\nand complete enzymatic depolymerization becomes less dependent\non the bulk crystallinity, even if it surpasses the previously recom-\nmended degradable threshold value of 20%\n57. By harsher pre-\ntreatment involving microwaves, PET’sM n can be reduced below the\nentanglement length of 3500 g mol−1 and readily hydrolyzed using an\nIsPETase variant at ambient temperature67. Within this Mn range, con-\nventional indicators of high crystalline PET, such as the increased ratio\nFig. 2 | Schematic illustration of the optimal waste PET pre-treatment process\nrequired for enzymatic recycling.To improve its economic viability, the cryo-\ngrinding step is considered optional and omitted here.

A simpliﬁed schematic surface plot illustrating the\nthreshold values for optimal depolymerization performance emphasizes the\ninterdependence of these parameters. Additional parameters inﬂuencing decom-\nposition performance, such as varyingT\ng of the surface layer and interior bulk\npolymers, as well as the effect of water plasticization and polymer recrystallization\nunder biocatalytic conditions, should be considered.

The ﬂexibility of water-\nplasticized amorphous PET polymer chains enhances as reaction\ntemperatures rise between 40-70 °C, facilitating their accessibility to\nenzymatic hydrolysis\n69. Higher temperatures, however, lead to faster\npolymer recrystallization into non-degradable crystalline micro-\nstructures than enzymatic depolymerization can occur\n9,15,50,60. Conse-\nquently, recent studies indicate a preference for reaction temperatures\nbetween 65 and 70 °C and the use of thermotolerant enzymes, such as\nLCC-ICCG\n9,15,T u r b o P E T a s e57 and PES-H115,24,36,61,70,71,i np i l o t - s c a l ep r o -\ncesses that resemble industrial settings9,57,71.A c c o r d i n g l y ,t h e r m o -\nstabilization has been implemented as a primary strategy to enhance\nthe depolymerization capability of mesophilic PET hydrolases,\nincluding Kubu-P\n29 and IsPETase14. Nonetheless, regardingIsPETase,\ndespite substantial research having raised its melting point (Tm)b y\nover 37 °C72– 74, the most advanced variants remain inferior to LCC-\nICCG in large-scale PET depolymerization tests15. This raises the\nquestion of whether a highTm (above 85 °C) can serve as the sole\ncriterion, as commonly employed in previous studies6,8,t od e t e r m i n ei f\nas p e c iﬁc enzyme inherently exhibits the necessary long-term stability\nand activity over several hours for the rapid PET decomposition at\nelevated temperatures. Instead, future research should evaluate the\nkinetic stability of an enzyme under operational conditions to provide\na broader assessment of its thermostability.\nThe continuous release of terephthalate (TPA) monomer as a\nresult of enzymatic PET hydrolysis lowers the pH value of the reaction\nsupernatant, which may inﬂuence enzyme activity and stability, as well\nas the compositions of the product mixture\n15,75. Increased concentra-\ntions of unwanted oligomeric ester intermediates can hinder sub-\nsequent product puriﬁcation and diminish the yield of pure TPA.\nTherefore, recently demonstrated depolymerization processes are\nfrequently pH-controlled in the range of 7– 8, which is appropriate for\nmost known PET hydrolases\n9,43,57. Nonetheless, low-concentrated\nphosphate or Tris buffers are commonly used in lab-scale bior-\neactors with pH control\n9,57. This should be avoided in large industrial\nsettings to reduce costs and ensure reactor durability. pH control is\nconsidered a concern regarding the economic and environmental\nimpacts of industrial PET recycling\n12. For future lab-scale studies, these\nimpacts can be mitigated by utilizing ammonia in place of NaOH for pH\nregulation\n12,58 or implementing small-scale bioreactors (<50 mL), such\nas the modiﬁed Chi.Bio systems instead of other larger commercial\nbioreactors76. Nonetheless, because small reactors can only accom-\nmodate less than 10% solid loading, it is recommended to validate the\nprocess in medium-sized reactors (in litre scales) that allow standard\nagitation with up to 30% solid loading beforeﬁnal industrial imple-\nmentation at cubic meter scale (Box1). A more ambitious long-term\nvision to address this pH-related issue may involve designing a PET\nhydrolase that is less sensitive to pHﬂuctuations or that is optimized\nfor a low pH range to facilitate rapid accumulation of exclusively\npure TPA.\nAlongside the utilization of standardized PET feedstocks, estab-\nlishing standardized bioreactor conditions by deﬁning optimal solid\nTable 1 | Selected parameters related to polymer properties and pre-treatment necessitating standardization and complete\ndocumentation\nParameter Example value/range/unit* Notes\nPET properties related to depolymerization efﬁcacy\nCrystallinity Ideal: <15%; acceptable: 0 –20%50,60,126 Usually refers to the averaged value of the bulk polymer measurable\nby differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)\nTg 65 °C–81 °C (bulk polymer, anhydrous)53\n48.1 °C (surface layer, anhydrous)54\n~40 °C (surface layer, water-plasticized)53\nPreferably measured using DSC; the plasticization effect of water\ncan reduce theTg of bulk polymer by≥16 °C\nMolecular weight (e.g., number-\naveraged, Mn)\nPET packaging: 14,000–25,000 g mol-1 (refs. 36,56)\nCryomilled PET particles: 13,000–20,000 g mol-1 (ref. 36)\nGoodfellow PETﬁlm: 19,000–25,000 g mol−1 (refs.36,68)\nPET NP: <6000 g mol−1 (ref. 36)\nMeasurable using gel permeation chromatography (GPC)36,56,68 or\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)60\nParticle sizes Pellets: <1 mm diameter (depending on the diameter of\nthe die plate holes)\n(Cryo-)milled particles: usually <500 µm used after\nsieving\nThe size of milled particles determined/separated using sieve\nanalysis\nSSA Milled particles: >7.5 mm\n2 mg−1 (ref. 55) Related to average particle sizes\nParameters for melt-extrusion, amorphization, and micronization\nMelt temperature 230 –280 °C9,55,56 A temperature gradient can be utilized in the extruder\nExtrusion screw speed 200 –4000 rpm (refs.55,56) Enhanced degradability resulting from reduced screw speed 56\nQuenching temperature −196 °C (liquid nitrogen) to 80 °C9,59; ideally using ice\nwater (0 °C)59\n–\nGrinding temperature −196 °C (liquid nitrogen) to room temperature9,59,62 Strain-induced crystallization can be minimized at lower\ntemperatures\nGrinding speed 4500 rpm (ref. 9) Not given in almost all past studies\n*For more commonly utilized conditions and value ranges that have been mentioned in over three independent studies, speciﬁc citations are not provided.

Molecular engineering tools are frequently absent for\nmodifying microbial thermophiles\n83, leading to the infrequent\ndemonstration of thermotolerant whole-cell catalysts for PET decom-\nposition at its optimal temperature.

Consequently, mesophilic\nPET hydrolases must be expressed at sufﬁciently high levels and tai-\nlored to enable the rapid release of growth-essential monomers into\nthe medium, outpacing their translocation into microbial cells and\nsubsequent metabolism. The efﬁcacy of PET depolymerization under\nthese conditions is expected to be signiﬁcantly lower than that at\nelevated temperatures exceeding 65 °C. Thus, an upcycling strategy\nutilizing these strains to produce value-added chemicals should always\nbe considered to realize potential economic viability. In addition,\nfocusing on“easier” substrates that can be depolymerized faster at\nambient temperatures may enhance the utility of these PET-trophic\nstrains for stakeholders. These include PET oligomers that have been\nrigorously pretreated or pre-degraded\n67,86, as well as alternative\npolyesters with similar chemical compositions, such as the commer-\ncially available polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)\n80.T h et i m e\nand cost savings from bypassing polymer and monomer separation\nmay compensate the typically low depolymerization efﬁciency of\nwhole-cell catalysts, providing signiﬁcant beneﬁts compared to free\nenzyme-based depolymerization.\nAnother extreme example is the in situ remediation of wastewater\ncontaminated with synthetic microﬁbers, which, according to a cur-\nrent study, are primarily oligomeric PET87, for example, in efﬂuents in\ntextile production regions88 or general communal wastewater treat-\nment plants. PET hydrolases derived from marine environments\nexhibiting signiﬁcant salt tolerance\n28 can ultimately be utilized to\nconstruct environmentally resistant whole-cell catalysts when inte-\ngrated into a comparably robust microbial chassis\n89,90. Other meso-\nphilic wild-type enzymes may exhibit insufﬁcient activity and stability\nunder these harsh conditions, such as high salinity, extreme pH levels,\nor the presence of laundry detergents, necessitating further extensive\nenzyme optimization efforts\n91. Nonetheless, this may spark a heated\ndebate about releasing genetically modiﬁed microbes (GMM)92,w h i c h\nis strictly prohibited in the EU (and other countries). In academic lit-\nerature, this is referenced so far as a theoretical alternative in regions\nlacking other solutions93. However, as a result of intensive ongoing\nresearch activities, challenges associated with technical implementa-\ntions and governmental regulations may be addressed shortly to\nmaximize the beneﬁts of GMMs in combating plastic pollution while\nmitigating risks of environmental release\n92.\nScreening strategies for customizing superior PET\nhydrolases\nNumerous high-throughput screening (HTS) assays have been devel-\noped in recent years for the discovery and engineering of PET\nhydrolases16,94. However, their speciﬁc limitations in areas such as\ntechnical availability, ease of handling, and reproducibility necessitate\nre-evaluation before a standard guideline can be established.\nSeveral assays employ self-synthesized small-molecule surrogate\nsubstrates that resemble PET segments or degradation intermediates,\nsuch as mono- or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET or\nBHET)\n95– 97. While these proxy substrates offer practical beneﬁts,\nincluding simpliﬁed dosing and the compatibility with established HTS\nplatforms, they may result in a skewed identiﬁcation of short ester\nhydrolyzing activity without PET depolymerization capability98– 100,\nparticularly in environmental samples or functional metagenomics. On\nthe other hand, screening of mutant libraries derived from known PET\nhydrolases can beneﬁt from this assay category\n96,101, as increased\nactivity on MHET or BHET is frequently linked to the mitigation of their\ninhibitory effect, thereby improving overall PET decomposition per-\nformance. To minimize false positives, it is still highly advisable to\nconsistently prioritize the direct use of PET polymers in HTS\nBOX 1\nStandard guidelines for PET hydrolase characterization and\napplication\n- Test every PET hydrolase (natural or de novo designed) on a uniform\nPET substrate with all key parameters described (Table1).\n-I fd eﬁned waste PET sample is unavailable, use commercial amor-\nphous PETﬁlm (e.g., Goodfellow ES301445) or its cryomilled form.\n- For thermotolerant enzymes applicable at≥65 °C, employ PET-\nbased (amorphous PET or PET NP) HTS assays for enzyme\nengineering under industrial-like conditions (Table 2); small-\nmolecule proxy substrates should be avoided.\n- Evaluate top enzyme candidates in small bioreactors (<50 mL), fol-\nlowed by a sequential scale-upto 1 L, 100 L, and beyond (Fig.3).\nModify reaction parameters according to Table2 at each step as\nrequired.\n- Record pH-stat titration, accumulation of UV-absorbing products\n(e.g., TPA, MHET, and BHET, also known as TPA equivalents with the\nabbreviation TPAeq.), and polymer mass loss over time.\n- Report initial depolymerization rate as mol\nTPAeq. h−1 genzyme\n−1 or\nmolTPAeq. h−1 molenzyme\n−1.\n- Measure all polymer properties outlined in Table1 before and after\nreaction— and ideally at intermediate timepoints— to track changes\nin crystallinity, molecular weight, surface area, etc.\nPerspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60016-9\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:4684 6\nexperimental setups. Optimal PET substrates must demonstrate uni-\nform polymer properties, such as low-crystallinity and high speciﬁc\nsurface area, facilitating rapid decomposition that can be observed\nwithin a constrained reaction volume, such as microplate wells or\nmicrodroplets, and a short timeframe, ideally under one hour. PET\nnanoparticles (NP), produced through solvent displacement\nprocesses\n102– 104, are a polymeric substrate option characterized by a\nuniform size range of 100 ± 50 nm and lower molecular weights com-\npared to their precursor materials (Table1). These material properties\npromote their rapid enzymatic decomposition, even at ambient\ntemperature\n36,48,102– 105. PET NP can be used to detect microbial depo-\nlymerization activities by clear-zone assay when immobilized in agar\nplates. Similarly, the turbidity variations of homogenously suspended\nPET NP immobilized in other hydrogels can facilitate the determina-\ntion of PET hydrolysis kinetics\n36,70,102. However, PET NP tend to\nagglomerate in buffered aqueous solutions, complicating their hand-\nling in small reaction volumes such as microplate wells or micro-\ndroplets.

Microﬂuidics-based HTS also involves living cells, facilitating\nenzyme expression, biocatalysis, and product detection within a single\nmicrodroplet or microbead\n116. These methods may not effectively\nidentify thermotolerant enzyme variants because the optimal tem-\nperatures for cell growth typically do not exceed 40 °C, while apparent\nPET depolymerization activity is generally detectable at temperatures\nabove 50 °C. The same limitation may also pertain to other cell growth-\nbased screening assays, such as enzyme surface display\n117,118.W h i l et h e s e\nHTS assays primarily evaluate mesophilic PET hydrolases which typi-\ncally necessitate costly and risky thermostabilization engineering prior\nto validating their potential for industrial PET recycling, these enzymes\nshould be better suited to the alternative application scenarios at lower\ntemperatures discussed above.\nTable 2 | Selected parameters related to enzyme characteristics and reaction conditions necessitating standardization and\ncomplete documentation\nParameter Example value/range/unit* Notes\nBiochemical characteristics of PET hydrolases\nTm Ideal: >85 °C >10 °C higher than the operational temperature 8\nEnzyme lifetime Half lifetime ( t1/2) at operational conditions Not determined in almost all past studies\nTurnover rate (kcat)0 . 5 –2s −1 (refs. 119,121)-\ninvKM 0.02–1 µM (ref.119)\n0.2–3 µM (ref.121)\nSigniﬁcantly affected by reaction temperatures and substrate crystallinity\nReactive site density (Γ) 0.01 –0.2 µmol g−1 (ref. 119)\n1.3–13.4 nmol g−1 (amorphous PET)121\n4–40 nmol g−1 (crystalline PET)121\nHigher values are associated with crystalline PET, which complicates the intuitive\nunderstanding of this parameter\nIon dependency Up to 20 mM CaCl 2 or MgCl2\n34,134 Ca2+ can stabilize/activate certain bacterial PET hydrolases8\nBuffer dependency 0.1 –1.0 M phosphate buffer (most bacterial PET\nhydrolases)\n0.05–0.1 M glycine-NaOH (IsPETase)\n<1 M Tris HCl (fungal cutinases)\n43\nHigh buffer concentrations can stabilize selected bacterial PET hydrolases; Tris can\ninhibit certain bacterial PET hydrolases135\nBioreactor and high-throughput screening (HTS) conditions\nReactor volume Bioreactor: >30 mL (ref. 76)\nHTS: usually <200 µL\nFor HTS: small proxy ester substrates should be avoided\nEnzyme loading 0.5 –3m genzyme gPET\n−1 To improve accuracy, alternative units based on molenzyme gPET\n−1 should be used\nSolid loading Bioreactor: 10 –30%\nHTS: usually <10%\nDeep well microplates may allow for the implementation of high solid loading HTS\nBuffer concentration Bioreactor: 0 –100 mM\nHTS: 0.1–1M\nBuffer-free conditions preferred for larger reactors\npH Usually 7 –9 pH regulation is essential for bioreactors; a buffer is mandatory for HTS assays\nTemperature 65 –72 °C -\nAgitation/mixing Bioreactor: 200 –800 rpm\nHTS: usually <1000 rpm\nAn often-neglected determinant parameter necessitating thorough examination\nInitial rate Unit: μmolTPAeq. h−1 L−1 (refs. 9,15)-\nSpeciﬁca c t i v i t y U n i t :μmolTPAeq. h–1 mgenzyme\n–1 (refs. 9,15)-\nReaction time >90% depolymerization achieved within <12 h\n(refs. 9,57)\nAn extension to 24 h is recommended for enzymes active at <65 °C\n*For more commonly utilized conditions and value ranges that have been mentioned in over three independent studies, speciﬁc citations are not provided.

A few recent studies demonstrated variations of\nthis standard workﬂow, particularly characterized by the simultaneous\ndetection of hydrolysis products and quanti ﬁcation of soluble\nrecombinant enzymes in cell lysates through various optical\ntechniques\n101,108. The latter can replace the labor-intensive and costly\nhigh-throughput protein puriﬁcation step while maintaining high data\naccuracy of speciﬁc enzyme activities, which is crucial for machine-\nlearning-guided enzyme engineering. To optimize these assays, proxy\nsubstrates like BHET and its derivatives\n96,101 can be replaced with, for\nexample, cryomilled commercially available amorphous PET with\ndeﬁned characteristics\n62,68, particularly for HTS using microplate\nreaders. This may enable solid loading of >10% in microplate wells to\nmore accurately resemble standardized industrial conditions (Table2).\nFuture methodological advancement to close\nknowledge gaps\nCurrently used endpoint measurements for assessing depolymeriza-\ntion efﬁcacy allow for basic comparisons between engineered enzymes\nand their references, but they lack time-resolved data throughout the\ndegradation process. As a result, molecular insights required to\nunderstand the mechanisms underlying interfacial biocatalysis reac-\ntions are frequently missing. Computational modeling based on\nrecently resolved complex structures of various PET hydrolases with\nsubstrate analogues\n16 may elucidate the catalytic cycle in atomic detail.\nStill, it fails to account for other important aspects such as enzyme\nadsorption/desorption behavior and PET physical properties. Much\nevidence suggests that these latter aspects, which reﬂect non-covalent\ninteractions, serve as key bottlenecks for the overall reaction.\nFig. 3 | Schematic workﬂow for discovering, engineering, andﬁnally applying\nnovel PET hydrolases in industrial-scale waste plastic recycling (for more\ndetails, see Box1). The function-based HTS method is an essential component of\nthe workﬂow. Given that agar-plate or microﬂuidics-based screening involves living\ncells, which prevents the detection of PET hydrolysis at elevated temperatures,\nmicroplate-based HTS (detailed in the lower part) may have the potential to be\nprioritized. Colorimetric orﬂuorometric methods, sensitive at different wave-\nlengths, are optimal for the distinct quantiﬁcation of functional enzyme con-\ncentrations in cell lysates and the monomers released from PET depolymerization.\nThis approach enables rapid screening of large mutant libraries for efﬁcient PET\nhydrolases while also producing high-quality data at a high throughput that can be\nused for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering\n116.\nPerspective https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60016-9\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:4684 8\nThe most explicit example of this is the resilience of crystalline PET to\nenzymatic hydrolysis. However, small, soluble PET fragments, similar\nto those used in computational analyses, can be hydrolyzed very\nquickly\n119, which also implies that the main activation barrier for the\noverall process lies outside catalytic bond breakage. The classical way\nto single out the importance of different steps in a complex reaction is\ncomparative kinetics, and this approach has two key requirements.\nFirstly, a simple yet realistic microkinetic reaction scheme, which\nintroduces rate constants for the interconversion of substrate and\nintermediates, and secondly experimental methods that provide suf-\nﬁcient data to support kinetic modeling. At the current stage, none of\nthese areas are well-developed for PET hydrolases, but some progress\nhas been made. For example, limitations associated with an undeﬁned\nconcentration of the insoluble substrate have been addressed by\nintroducing substrate area\n60,120, or attack site density119 as proxies for\nmolar concentration. It has also proven useful to supplement the\nconventional conditions of substrate excess for steady-state kinetic\nanalysis with measurements, where the enzyme is in excess concerning\nthe substrate\n102,121. This latter experimental condition is the opposite of\nthe conventional kinetic framework, and it has been termed inverse\nMichaelis– Menten kinetics\n122. A steady-state approximation under\ninverse conditions never occurs in homogenous reactions but may be\nrelevant in two-phase systems as new reaction sites on the surface are\nreplenished continuously\n123. Parameters from inverse kinetic analyses,\nparticularly the maximal rate at high enzyme load, are of interest\nbecause they reﬂect both catalytic efﬁcacy and the density of reaction\nor attack sites on the solid surface. Speciﬁcally, a combination of\ndata obtained with either enzyme- or substrate-excess provides\ninformation on the maximal turnover (k\ncat in s−1), KM (Michaelis\nconstant in M), and the density of hydrolysable sites on the PET surface\n(in mol\nsites gPET\n−1)122. If experiments are only conducted under condi-\ntions of substrate excess,KM values will be in mass-based units, typi-\ncally g L−1. This parameter can be useful for comparing different\nenzymes acting on the same substrate, but as mass-basedKM values\ndepend strongly on the SSA of the substrate, it is generally not\nmeaningful to compare values obtained with different types of PET.\nWork along these lines has identiﬁed some general trends in PET\nhydrolase kinetics, which are listed in Table2. For a number of the\nmost proﬁcient enzymes acting on insoluble PET at moderate tem-\nperature (30– 50 °C),k\ncat was 0.5– 2s −1,a n dt h i sw a s1– 2o r d e r so f\nmagnitude slower than their hydrolysis of the same bond in soluble\nPET fragments\n119,121,124. The same enzymes hadKM values in the hun-\ndredths of nM range, and taken together, this implies strong substrate\ninteractions but slow turnover compared to other hydrolases acting on\nnative, soluble substrates\n125. A molecular description of these\ncharacteristics appears to be a promising avenue for further under-\nstanding of structure-function relationships for PET hydrolases. To\nachieve this, we will need better methods to quantify the accumulation\nand decay of intermediates; both enzyme-substrate complexes and\nPET fragments. Progress curves for these intermediates will elucidate\nthe complex pathway from insoluble polymer to the monomers TPA\nand EG, and it will also provide the necessary experimental input for\nfurther kinetic modeling. Advanced knowledge in this respect\nmay help to accelerate the late stage of the industrial recycling\nprocess, which is currently thought to be hampered by these hydro-\nlysis intermediates. Finally, we encourage more experimental and\ncomputational research into the relationship between polymer con-\nformation and enzyme activity. Some reports have pointed out a\nstrong effect on catalysis of thetrans-gauche isomerism in the PET\nchain\n52,67, and it has been proposed that constraints on isomerization\nmay lessen gradually as PET chains are shortened in the enzymatic\nprocess126. Information on this would be important both for the fun-\ndamental understanding of the interfacial enzyme reaction and as a\nguide for enzyme engineering."}

Other related research\navenues, which have received considerably less attention yet appear to\nhold signiﬁcant promise, should be explored with greater focus in the\nfuture. For instance, enzyme immobilization may enhance stability and\nfacilitate multiple applications\n127,128. Also, the development of syner-\ngistic enzyme cocktails may enable reduced dosages or address mixed\nplastic waste\n129, a more complex challenge within the plastic pollution\ndilemma. For the latter, a moderate temperature range of 40– 50 °C\nmay be considered when extended operation time is acceptable, par-\nticularly when not all applied enzymes exhibit adequate half-lives at\nhigher temperatures.\nSimultaneously, understanding and optimizing process condi-\ntions should be afforded equal attention and effort as enzyme\nengineering in future research. This may involve optimizing melt-\nextrusion parameters\n56, investigating the feasibility of omitting energy-\nintensive micronization stages, or implementing alternative pre-\ntreatment techniques\n130, all of which could reduce the costs of the\ncurrent process11,12.

The feature extraction block \nconsisted of six layers: two pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by \na dimension reduction max pooling layer after each pair. The first pair \nof convolutional layers used filters of size 3 × 3 × 3 and the second pair \nhad filters of size 2 × 2 × 2. For the first pair, the convolutional layers had \n100 and 200 filters and for the second pair, the convolutional layers \nhad 200 and 400 filters. Furthermore, the rectified linearity unit func-\ntion (Relu) was applied to the output of the four convolutional layers. \nThe final feature maps generated by the feature extraction block had \ndimensions of size 400 × 3 × 3 × 3. These feature maps were flattened \ninto a one-dimensional vector of size 10,800 before being passed to \nthe classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully \nconnected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2 and 0, respec-\ntively. Like the feature extraction block, the output of the first two dense \nlayers was transformed by the Relu function. T o obtain a vector of 20 \nprobability scores representing the network prediction for each of the \namino acids, we applied a softmax activation function to the output of \nthe third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a machine learning \nas a service on https://mutcompute.com.\nMutCompute predictions\nMutCompute predictions were obtained by running the WT PETase \n(PDB ID 5XJH) and ThermoPETase (PDB ID 6IJ6) through our machine \nlearning as a service at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered \nby sorting by the probability assigned to the WT amino acid. We filtered \n34 and 39 residues from the WT PETase and ThermoPETase crystal struc-\ntures, respectively. From these filtered residues, we assigned priority \nto our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the ten residues from \neach crystal structure with the highest log2 fold change between the \npredicted amino acid and WT amino acid probabilities. Before experi-\nmentation, selected residues were visualized with MutCompute-View, \nwhich is built on top of NGL Viewer (https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl), \nto ensure three things: (1) the prediction was chemically sound and \nnot because of a crystal or model artefact, (2) we were avoiding the \nactive site and binding pocket and (3) avoiding epistatic interactions \nbetween predictions and instead targeting predicted ‘instability hot-\nspots’ . MutCompute-View has been made publicly available at https://\nmutcompute.com/view.\nProtein crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, data \nprocessing and model refinement\nT o identify crystallization conditions for FAST-PETase, a sample con-\ntaining 6 mg ml−1 purified FAST-PETase was screened in sparse-matrix \nscreening using Phoenix robotic system (Art Robinson). The initial hits \nwere identified with the rod-shaped crystals formed after incubating \nscreening plates at 25 °C for 3 days. The crystallization was optimized \nas 0.1 M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH 5.5 setup as sitting-drop \nvapour diffusion.\nIndividual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid \nnitrogen after cryoprotected with 30% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction \ndata were collected at the 23-ID-B beamline in the Advance Photon \nSource. The X-ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44 Å resolution \nfor FAST-PETase crystals using HKL2000 (ref. 30). The structure was \nsolved by molecular replacement with ThermoPETase structure as the \ninitial search model (PDB code 6IJ6, ref. 17). The molecular replacement \nsolution for FAST-PETase structure was iteratively built and refined \nusing Coot31 and the Phenix32 refinement package. Procheck and Mol-\nProbity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST-PETase structure. \nThe final statistics for data collection and structural determination \nare shown in Extended Data Table 1.\nCloning\nGenes encoding I. sakaiensis 201-F6 IsPETase (WT PETase) (accession \nnumber: A0A0K8P6T7), its mutants—PETase S121E/D186H/R280A  (Ther -\nmoPETase17) and PETaseS214H/I168R/W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/T140D \n(DuraPETase22), cutinase-like enzyme, from S. AHK190 (ref. 25) (Cut190) \n(accession number: BAO42836), LCC (accession number: G9BY57) \nand its mutant LCCF243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM)12—were commercially \nsynthesized for cloning. T o enable extracellular expression of PETase \nand its mutants in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the \nnucleotide sequence of the signal peptide SPpstu (21 amino acids) from \nmaltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-19 (ref. 33)  \nwas used to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 \namino acids) of WT PETase. The WT PETase and its mutants’ genes \nwith SPpstu presented at the N terminus were amplified by polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subse-\nquently, using the Gibson Assembly method, DNA fragments encoding \nWT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were subcloned into a \nmodified pBTK552 vector34 in which the antibiotic resistance marker \nwas swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a \nC-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence was added. T o enable \nintracellular expression of Cut190, LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli \n(DE3) (New England Biolabs), the nucleotide sequence encoding the \noriginal signal peptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The \nCut190, LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide sequence were \namplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, \nusing Gibson Assembly method, the DNA fragments encoding Cut190, \nLCC and ICCM were subcloned into a commercial vector-pET -21b (Nova-\ngen), which carries a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence. \nThe electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10β was transformed with the \nGibson Assembly product by following a standard electroporation \nprotocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was extracted from \nthe overnight culture of the cloning host by using the QIAprep Spin \nMiniprep kit (Qiagen). The DNA sequence of the extracted plasmid \nwas verified by Sanger sequencing. A list of nucleotide sequences and \nexpressed amino acid sequences of the genes used in the study is pro-\nvided in Supplementary Methods.\nVariant construction\nVariants of WT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were generated \nthrough site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR method described in \nthe Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit E0552S (New England Biolabs). \nThe constructed plasmids carrying WT PETase, ThermoPETase and \nDuraPETase genes were used as the templates for mutagenesis PCR \nreaction. The corresponding primer sequences and annealing tem-\nperature were designed and generated by using the NEBaseChanger \ntool. Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech Laboratories) were used as \nthe cloning host and transformed with the ligated plasmids using the \nheat-shock method provided in the manufacturer’s instructions. Plas-\nmid extraction and sequencing for the variants were performed under \nthe same conditions as described for plasmids carrying WT PETase, \nThermoPETase and DuraPETase genes.\nProtein expression and purification\nFor extracellular protein expression of WT PETase, ThermoPETase, \nDuraPETase and their variants, P . putida KT2440 was used as the expres-\nsion host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed with the cor-\nresponding constructed plasmids. For intracellular protein expression \nof Cut190, LCC, ICCM and their variants, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as \nthe expression host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed \nwith the corresponding constructed plasmids. A single colony of an  \nP . putida KT2440 or E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain harbouring one of the con-\nstructed plasmids was inoculated into 2 ml of Luria Bertani medium \nwith 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C/225 r.p.m. The \novernight-grown culture (using 150 µl) was scaled up with 1,000-fold \ndilution in a 500-ml triple baffled shake flask and grown to a cell density \nof 0.8 (optical density (OD600)) at 37 °C/225 r.p.m. Protein expression was \ninduced by adding 0.2 mM of isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside \nand cells were cultured for 24 h at 30 °C/225 r.p.m. For isolation of the \nextracellularly expressed PETase enzymes, the induced cell culture was \ncentrifuged at 14,000g and 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the supernatant \nthat accommodates secretory protein. For isolation of the intracellularly \nexpressed Cut190, LCC and ICCM, the induced cell culture was collected \nby centrifugation at 4,000g and 4 °C for 20 min. Cell pellets were then \nresuspended in 25 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) \n(Thermo Fisher Scientific) pH 7.0 buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, \n1 g l−1 lysozyme and 5 µl of Pierce Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher \nScientific), followed by mixing on a rocker for 20 min at 4 °C. Subse-\nquently, cells were lysed by sonication and the resulting cell lysate was \ncentrifuged at 14,000g and 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the supernatant \nthat contains soluble proteins. Target proteins from the above two types \nof supernatant were both purified by HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo \nFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Desalt-\ning of the protein eluent was carried out by using Sephadex G-25 PD-10 \ncolumns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. \nAll purification and desalting steps were performed at 4 °C in a cold \nroom. Afterwards, the purified protein was concentrated to a final vol-\nume of 1 ml by the 50 ml, 10-kDa cut-off Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter \ndevice (EMD Millipore Corporation) and preserved in DPBS (pH 7.0). \nThe protein concentration was then determined by using the Coomas-\nsie Plus Bradford Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Infinite \nM200 PRO microplate reader (T ecan) to measure the absorbance of \nassay mixtures. The presence and purity of the purified proteins were \nassessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nIn vitro analysis of PET-hydrolytic activity using commercial \nGoodfellow PET film (gf-PET)\nT o evaluate the PET-hydrolytic activity of PETase and its variants, \nthe homogenous amorphous gf-PET film (Goodfellow, US 577-529-\n50; specification: 1.3–1.4 g cm−3 density, 1.58–1.64 refractive index, \n100 × 10 −13 cm3. cm cm −2 s−1 Pa−1 permeability to water at 25 °C, \n20–80 × 0−6 K−1 coefficient of thermal expansion, 0.13–0.15 W m−1 K−1 \nat 23 °C thermal conductivity) was used as the substrate for degradation \nassays with the purified PETase enzyme and its variants. The gf-PET film \nwas prepared in a circular form (6 mm in diameter, roughly 11.4 mg) and \nwas washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol and deionized water \nbefore usage. Subsequently, the gf-PET film was put into a glass test \ntube and fully submerged in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer \n(pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. The test tube was tightly capped \nand wrapped with parafilm to minimize volatilization. The reaction \nmixture was then incubated at 30, 40, 50, 55 and 60 °C for 96 h. Fol-\nlowed by removing the enzyme-treated gf-PET film from the reaction \nmixture, the enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 85 °C for \n20 min. The reaction mixture samples were then centrifuged at 10,000g \nfor 5 min. The supernatant of each sample was further analysed by \nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantifying PET \nmonomers released from the PET depolymerization.\nT o compare the PET-hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase with WT PETase, \nThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM across a range of pH (6.5–8.0) \nat 30 and 40 °C, a similar experimental setup was used. The circular \ngf-PET film (6 mm diameter, roughly 11.4 mg) was used as the substrate. \nThe enzyme reactions were performed with 200 nM purified enzyme in \n600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer with various pH values (6.5, 7.0, \n7.5 or 8.0) at 30 and 40 °C. After incubating the enzyme reaction for 96 h, \nthe supernatant of the reaction mixture was also analysed by HPLC for \nquantifying PET monomers released from the PET depolymerization.\nDepolymerization of pc-PET plastics\nHole-punched pc-PET films (6 mm in diameter) from 51 postconsumer \nplastic products were serially treated by 200 nM FAST-PETase in 600 µl \nof 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. Fresh enzyme solu-\ntion was replenished every 22 h to maximize enzymatic depolym -\nerization rate for degrading the 51 samples of various pc-PET films.  \nThe supernatant of the enzymatic hydrolysate of the PET samples was \nanalysed by HPLC for quantifying PET monomers released throughout \nthe whole depolymerization process.\nThe time-course analysis of degrading a pc-PET film (Bean cake con-\ntainer) by various PHEs was conducted at 50 °C. The reactions were \nperformed with 200 nM enzyme in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH \nbuffer (pH 8.0) and terminated at 6, 12, 18 or 24 h for quantifying total \nPET monomers released at each time point.\nA large, untreated and transparent pc-PET (Bean cake container, \nroughly 6.4 g) was treated by 200 nM of FAST-PETase in 100 mM of \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. The whole piece of transpar-\nent PET container was fully submerged in 2.5 l of enzyme solution and \ncompletely degraded after 48 h.\nDepolymerization of an untreated water bottle\nT o depolymerize an untreated water bottle, fragments were cut out or \nhole-punched from various sections (finish/neck, shoulder, body, tran-\nsition to base, base, base centre) of an untreated water bottle (500 ml, \nCG Roxane LLC.). The fragments were fully submerged in 600 µl of \n100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. \nThe depolymerization was conducted at 50, 60 and 72 °C for 24 h.\nPET water bottle thermal pretreatment\nPET water bottles (500 ml, CG Roxane LLC.) were heated at 290 °C \non a hot plate covered with aluminium foil. Once PET was melted \n(about 1 min), another piece of aluminium foil was placed on top \nof the melted PET. A stainless-steel cylinder (diameter 6 cm, weight \n616 g) was used to press the melted PET into a film with a flat surface. \nAfter pressing for 1 min, the stainless-steel cylinder was lifted and \nthe PET film was heated again at 290 °C for 15 min. After heating, the \nhot PET films covered with the aluminium foil was rapidly cooled in \nan ice bath. After cooling, the reprocessed PET films were peeled off \nfrom the aluminium foil.\nMeanwhile, a treated but more highly crystalline film can also be \nproduced through a slight modification (after pressing the melted PET \nfilms for 1 min by the cylinder, the films were directly quenched by an \nice bath without the reheating step) of the above protocol.\nDepolymerization of a pretreated water bottle\nT o depolymerize pretreated water bottle films, circular films (6 mm \nin diameter; roughly 25 mg) were hole-punched from the pretreated \nwater bottle and treated by 200 nM of various PHEs in 600 µl of 100 mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at temperatures ranging from 50 to 72 °C \nfor 24 h.\nT o completely depolymerize a pretreated whole water bottle), the \nmelted plastic pucks from an entire water bottle (500 ml; roughly \n9 g, CG Roxane LLC.) were cut into small rectangular flakes (roughly \n1 × 3 cm). The resulting flakes were then fully submerged in 200 ml of \nenzyme solution that contained 200 nM of FAST-PETase in 100 mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0). Depolymerization was conducted at \n50 °C and fresh enzyme solution was replenished every 24 h to maxi-\nmize the enzymatic depolymerization rate.\nDepolymerization of polyester products\nFive different commercial polyester products were cut into small \npieces and used as the substrates that were fully submerged in 600 µl \nof 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. \nEnzyme treatment on these five polyester products was conducted \nat 50 °C. After 24 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated. The \nenzyme degradation solution was used to determine how much PET \nmonomers were released from hydrolysing these polyester products \nby various PHEs.\nArticle\nDepolymerization of large, untreated pc-PET container and \nregeneration of virgin PET\nA large, untreated, and green coloured pc-PET container was cut into \nsmall rectangular flakes (roughly 1 × 3 cm). Then 3.0 g of the coloured \npc-PET flakes was serially treated by 200 nM FAST-PETase in 100 mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. 200 nM of fresh enzyme was \nadded to the degradation solution every 24 h to maximize enzymatic \ndegradation rate. All the coloured pc-PET fragments were completely \ndegraded after 6 days.\nOn completion of degradation, the enzyme degradation solution was \nfiltered and the filtrate was collected for regeneration. The pH of the \nfiltrate was adjusted to pH 11 with NaOH to hydrolyse remaining MHET. \nThe solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h to complete the \nhydrolysis. The pH of the solution was subsequently adjusted to 2 with \n37% HCl. The precipitate was filtered and washed several times with \ndeionized water and dried under vacuum overnight. Then 4.3 g of TPA \nwas collected and used in the next step without further purification. \nSettings used for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were 400 MHz, \nd6-DMSO: 8.03 ppm (s, 4H).\nT o a suspension of TPA (4.31 g, 25.9 mmol) in CH3OH (150 ml), 95% H2SO4 \n(2.0 ml) was added dropwise at room temperature. The mixture was \nstirred at reflux for 24 h and became a clear solution. The reaction mixture \nwas then cooled to room temperature. Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) was \nsubsequently recrystallized from the reaction mixture and collected after \nfiltration. These white crystals were washed with cold CH3OH and dried \nunder vacuum for 4 h to afford DMT (4.12 g) with a yield of 82%. 1H NMR \n(400 MHz, CDCl3): 8.08 ppm (s, 4H), 3.93 ppm (s, 6H).\nT o a three-necked round bottom flask equipped with an air con-\ndenser, DMT (4.12 g, 21.1 mmol) was added. The flask was evacuated \nunder vacuum and refilled with nitrogen gas for three times. Ethyl -\nene glycol (1.20 ml, 21.5 mmol) was added, followed by the addition of \ntitanium isopropoxide (0.06 ml, 0.21 mmol). The mixture was stirred \nat 160 °C for 1 h, 200 °C for 1 h and 210 °C for 2 h under nitrogen.  \nThe reaction temperature was further increased to 260 °C, and high \nvacuum was applied to remove unreacted monomers. The mixture was \nstirred at 260 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The result-\ning PET was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, 10 ml) \nand added dropwise to CH3OH to remove the catalyst. PET (2.83 g) was \ncollected as white solids after centrifuging and dried under vacuum.\nGravimetric determination of the degraded pc-PET film\nThe intact pc-PET film was washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol \nand deionized water followed by drying the samples under vacuum \nat 30 °C for 24 h before gravimetric measurement. After enzymatic \ntreatment, the degraded pc-film followed the same washing and drying \nprocedure before gravimetric measurement. The weights of the pc-PET \nfilm before and after enzyme treatment were compared to determine \nthe weight loss of the degraded pc-PET film.\nAnalytical method for measuring PET monomers released\nHPLC was used to analyse the PET monomers TPA and MHET released \nfrom PET depolymerization. The assay samples were filtered with \n0.2-µm nylon syringe filters (Wheaton Science) before running HPLC. \nMeasurement of TPA and MHET was performed using a Dionex Ulti-\nMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse \nPlus C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm2, 3.5 µm) with detection wavelength \nat 260 nm. Column oven was held at 30 °C with 1% acetic acid in water \nor 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase over the course of the \n30-min sequence under the following conditions: 1 to 5% organic (vol/\nvol) for 5 min, 5 to 100% organic (vol/vol) for 8 min, 100% organic (vol/\nvol) for 10 min and 100 to 5% organic for 2 min followed by 5% organic \nfor 5 min. The flow rate was fixed at 0.8 ml min−1. A standard curve was \nprepared using commercial TPA with ≥99.0% purity (Thermo Fisher \nScientific) or MHET ≥97.0% purity (Advanced ChemBlocks Inc.).\nAnalytical method for measuring melting temperature (Tm) of \nproteins\nT o evaluate the thermostability of WT PETase and its variants, differential \nscanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine their respective Tm.  \nPurified protein samples were concentrated to roughly 300–500 µM \nusing Microcon Centrifugal Filter 10K Devices (Millipore). Then 10 µl \nof concentrated protein solution (DPBS buffer pH 7.0) was placed \nin an aluminium Tzero pan and sealed with a Tzero hermetic lid (TA \nInstruments). Tm of the protein samples was analysed by a DSC250 (TA \nInstruments) with a RCS90 electric chiller. Two DSC procedures were \nused depending on the anticipated denaturation temperature of the \nprotein. The first DSC method heated from 40 to 90 °C at 10 °C min−1, \nheld at 90 °C for 2 min, then cooled from 90 to 40 °C at −10 °C min−1. \nThe second method heated from 20 to 70 °C at 10 °C min−1, held at 70 °C \nfor 2 min and cooled from 70 to 40 °C at −10 °C min−1. The denaturation \ntemperature of the proteins was measured on the heating ramp trace \nas the midpoint value at half-height.\nAnalytical method for determining PET film crystallinity\nDSC was used to determine the percentage crystallinity of the PET \nfilms hole-punched from the postconsumer plastics. PET film samples \n(4–10.5 mg) were placed in aluminium Tzero pans with a Tzero solid \nsample lid. Samples were first heated from 40 to 300 °C at 5 °C min, \nheld at 300 °C for 1 min, cooled from 300 to 30 °C at –5 °C min−1 and \nheld at 30 °C for 1 min in a DSC250 (TA Instruments) with a RCS90 elec-\ntric chiller. The percentage crystallinity was determined on the first \nheating scan using the enthalpies of melting and cold crystallization. \nThe equation used to calculate percentage crystallinity within the PET \nfilm was the following\nΔH ΔH\nΔH%crystallinity = − ×1 00mc c\nm\n\n\n\n\nwhere ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting ( J g−1), ΔHcc is the enthalpy of cold \ncrystallization ( J g−1), and ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting for a 100% \ncrystalline PET sample, which is 140.1 J g−1 (refs. 12,22). ΔHm and ΔHcc were \nmeasured by integrating from 90–100 °C to roughly 260 °C with a linear \nbaseline. The percentage crystallinity was calculated using the TRIOS \nsoftware package. The glass transition temperatures of the PET films \nwere measured using the second heating scan: 30–300 at 10 °C min\n−1, \nheld at 300 °C for 1 min and then 300–40 °C at −10 °C min−1. The glass \ntransition temperatures for all the PET films were between 80 and 82 °C.\nGel permeation chromatography (GPC)\nGPC measurement was performed at an on an Agilent system with \na 1260 Infinity isocratic pump, degasser and thermostated column \nchamber held at 30 °C. A mixture of chloroform with 50 ppm amylene \nand 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (2.0 vol%) was used as the mobile \nphase at 0.5 ml min−1. Molecular weights (Mn, Mw) and polydispersity \nindices (Ð) were determined relative to polystyrene standards. For \nsample preparation for GPC, about 8 mg of PET was dissolved in 0.15 ml \n1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Once PET was completely dissolved, \nchloroform was added to make a total volume of 2.50 ml. The solution \nwas filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with a pore \nsize of 0.45 µm. Then 100 µl of the sample solution was injected into \nthe GPC system.\nSEM\nPET films were mounted onto a 3.2-mm SEM stub using carbon tape. \nSamples were sputter coated with 8-nm platinum/palladium using \na Cressington 208HR Sputter Coater. The metal was sputter coated \nonto the sample by means of plasma generated with argon present in \nthe chamber. SEM imaging was performed under vacuum using a Zeiss \nSupra40 SEM. The electron beam intensity was 5 kV.\nAFM\nAFM was performed on an Aylum MFP-3D atomic force microscope \n(Asylum Research) in tapping mode. Images were recorded after a \nsurface scan on an area of 50 × 50 µm2. Image analysis, including his-\ntograms and surface roughness, was performed using Igor Pro.\nNMR spectroscopy\n1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE \nNEO spectrometer at room temperature in CDCl3 or d6-DMSO. Chemical \nshift was referenced to the residual solvent signal (1H NMR: 7.26 ppm \nin CDCl3, 2.50 ppm in d6-DMSO, respectively).\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature \nResearch Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\nData availability"}

The genes encoding IsPETaseTS (IsPETase S121E, D186H, \nR280A, signal sequence removed as by Son et al.24) and LCCICCG (LCC F243I, \nD238C, S283C, Y127G, signal sequence removed as by Tournier et al.16) were \ncommercially synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies as gBlock fragments \nwith codon optimization for expression in Escherichia coli cells. The IsPETaseTS \ngene was cloned into the NdeI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) sites of a pBbE8K vector \nmodified to contain a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag coding sequence following \nthe XhoI restriction site\n41, to form pBbE8K_IsPETaseTS. The gene encoding \nLCCICCG was cloned into the NdeI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) sites of pET-22b \nvector (Novagen) leading to fusion to a C-terminal hexa-histadine tag coding \nsequence, to form pET-22b_LCC\nICCG.

Rounds 1–6: iterative saturation mutagenesis. In each \nround, 24–30 residues were selected and individually randomized using cassette \nmutagenesis. Positions were chosen for mutation on the basis of a range of factors, \ndetailed in Supplementary Table 1. For residue identification via the Protein One \nStop Repair Shop webserver\n42, IsPETaseWT was used as the input protein (PDB \n5XJH), with all constraints fixed to the default settings; positions identified more \nthan twice by the software were selected for mutation. For residue identification \nvia the B-fitter software\n43, IsPETaseWT was again used as the input protein \n(PDB 5XJH); the 15 top positions ranked by highest B-factor were selected for \nmutation. DNA libraries at chosen residue positions were constructed via standard \noverlap-extension PCR, using degenerate primer pairs (containing an NNK codon \nat the position to be mutated) and pBbE8K_IsPETase\nTS as the template for round \n1, with the most active clone discovered at the end of each directed evolution cycle \nserving as the template for subsequent rounds. Primer sequences are provided in \nSupplementary Table 2.\nShuffling by overlap-extension PCR. After each round of evolution, beneficial \ndiversity was combined by a process of DNA shuffling.

The resulting genes \ncontained all possible combinations of mutations (from two to five mutations \nper gene) and were subsequently cloned into the pBbE8K vector as described \npreviously.\nVariant gene construction. HotPETase K212N, E213S, Y214S (HotPETase\nLR), was \ncreated via overlap-extension PCR with HotPETase as the template protein and \nprimers designed to encode the wild-type residues at positions 212–214.

For all protein expression and screening \nof libraries, transfer and aliquoting steps were performed using a Hamilton \nliquid-handling robot. pBbE8K_IsPETase libraries were expressed in chemically \ncompetent Origami 2 E. coli cells. Single colonies from a fresh transformation were \nused to inoculate 180 µl of Luria–Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 25 µg ml\n−1 \nkanamycin (to maintain the pBbE8K_PETase plasmid) and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline \n(to maintain the glutathione reductase (gor) gene-containing plasmid present in \nOrigami 2 cells), in 96-deep-well plates. Each plate contained six positive controls \nconsisting of clones of the parent template, and two negative controls consisting of \nclones containing pBbE8K_RFP (red fluorescent protein). Plates were incubated \novernight at 30 °C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Expression \ncultures were then prepared by inoculating 460 µl of 2YT media containing \n25 µg ml\n−1 kanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline with 40 µl of overnight culture \nin deep-well plates. The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C, 80% humidity \nin a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). When an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of \n1 was reached, protein production was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose to \na final concentration 10 mM and plates incubated for a further 20 h at 19 °C, 80% \nhumidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Cells were collected by centrifugation \nat 2,900g for 10 min and the resulting pellets resuspended in a lysis mix consisting \nof 50 µl of BugBuster Protein Extraction reagent containing 10 µg ml−1 DNase I. \nCell lysis was initiated by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, with 80% humidity in \na shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.) and the lysate produced diluted with 300 µl of \nreaction buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM glycine-OH (Gly-OH)). Insoluble cell debris was \nremoved via centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g to produce a clear cell lysate.\nProduction of purified proteins. IsPETase and its derivatives were expressed in \nchemically competent Origami 2 E. coli. Single colonies of freshly transformed cells \nwere cultured for 18 h at 30 °C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 µg ml\n−1 \nkanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline. 1 ml of the resulting culture was used to \ninoculate 50 ml of 2YT medium containing 25 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 \ntetracycline. Cultures were grown at 35 °C, 180 r.p.m. to an OD600 of 1. Protein \nproduction was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose (final concentration of \n10 mM) and cultures then grown at 19 °C for 20 h. The E. coli cells were gathered \nby centrifugation at 3,220g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (pH 7.5, \n50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 10 µg ml\n−1 DNase I). Cells were \ndisrupted by sonication and the resulting lysate clarified by centrifugation (13,500g \nfor 15 min). The soluble fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography via \napplication to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). After washing off unbound proteins with \nthe lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted \nwith elution buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl). \nProteins were desalted by application to 10DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad) and \neluted in storage buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). Protein purity \nwas confirmed by SDS–PAGE and concentrations determined by measuring the \nabsorbance at 280 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 39,670 M\n−1 cm−1 \nfor IsPETaseTS-IsPETaseM2, 41,160 M−1 cm−1 for IsPETaseM3-IsPETaseM7 and \n41,285 M−1 cm−1 for IsPETaseM8-HotPETase.\nFor the cutinase, LCCICCG, the gene was expressed in chemically competent \nE. coli BL21 (DE3). Single colonies of freshly transformed cells were cultured \nfor 18 h at 30 °C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 µg ml\n−1 ampicillin. \n1 ml of the resulting culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of auto-inducible 2YT \nmedium containing 25 µg ml−1 ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 35 °C, 180 r.p.m., \nto an OD600 of 1, and then cooled to 19 °C, for 20 h. Protein purification then \nproceeded as detailed for IsPETase, with protein concentrations determined using \nan extinction coefficient of 37,150 M−1 cm−1. HotPETase exhibits a high-level of \ncytosolic protein expression (roughly 110 mg l−1); LCCICCG has a lower level of \nprotein expression (roughly 20 mg l−1) (Supplementary Fig. 20).\nLibrary screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). The clarified cell lysate \nwas incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55–80 °C (pre-incubation \nstep) and subjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble \nprotein precipitate formed. To initiate the PET degradation reaction, 60–220 µl \nof clarified cell lysate was transferred to a 96-deep-well plate containing reaction \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) and a single 6 mm amoPET disc cut from a sheet \nin each well, to make a final reaction volume of 220–400 μl. Lysate volume was \nvaried across rounds to avoid overloading the UPLC column by keeping peak \nareas below 2,000 mAu and to limit evaporation at higher reaction temperatures \nand extended reaction times. Plates were then foil-sealed and incubated for 3–7 h \nat 55–70 °C, after which reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal \nvolume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM trifluoracetic acid solution. Following \nreaction quenching, plates were foil-sealed and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, \n80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble protein precipitate \nremoved by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC analysis sample was \nthen prepared by transferring 100 µl of the resulting reaction supernatant into a \nfresh 96-well microtitre plate and the plate foil-sealed. The most active clones of \neach round were then subjected to a second screening round, where each clone \nwas represented as a triplicate. All expression and screening protocols were as \ndescribed above, apart from overnight culture preparation, where LB media was \ninstead inoculated with 20 µl of a glycerol stock of the original overnight cultures \nfrom the library screening round. Details for the temperatures and lengths of the \npre-incubation steps, the lysate volumes added to reactions, and the temperatures \nand lengths of the reaction incubations for each round of directed evolution are \nprovided in Supplementary Table 1.\nPurified protein screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). AmoPET film \nassays with purified proteins were conducted as follows: a foil-sealed 96-deep-well \nplate containing the reaction buffer (library screening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM \nGly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its derivatives, pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi, for \nLCC\nICCG, as reported in Tournier et al.16), with a single 6 mm amoPET disc in each \nwell, was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40–70 °C) to equilibrate \nall reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration step). For \ndirected evolution hit retesting and beneficial diversity shuffling, purified \nproteins were incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55–80 °C before \nreaction set up (pre-incubation step, full details in Supplementary Table 1) and \nsubjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble protein \nprecipitate formed. The reaction was initiated by adding the purified enzymes \nto the prepared 96-deep-well plate containing reaction buffer and amoPET discs \n(final reaction conditions: 0.04 μM enzyme, 400 μl total volume). Protein variants \nwere arrayed across the 96-deep-well plate in triplicate. Plates were foil-sealed and \nincubated for up to 24 h at the desired temperature, after which reactions were \nterminated by the addition of an equal volume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM \ntrifluoracetic acid solution. Following reaction quenching, samples were incubated \nfor 30 min at 30 °C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble \nprotein precipitate removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC \nanalysis sample was then prepared by transferring 100 µl of the resulting reaction \nsupernatant into a fresh 96-well microtitre plate, and the plate foil-sealed.\nPurified protein screening using crystalline PET powder (cryPET) and \nalternative PET substrates. Crystalline PET powder assays were conducted \nas follows: a 12 ml lidded glass vial containing 5 ml of reaction buffer (library \nscreening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its \nderivatives or pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi for LCC\nICCG), with 20 mg crystalline PET \npowder (cryPET) was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40–70 °C) \nto equilibrate all reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration \nstep). The reaction was initiated by adding the purified protein (0.04 μM final \nconcentration) coupled with incubation at the desired temperature under agitation \nat 180 r.p.m. Samples were taken at multiple times points, quenched and prepared \nfor UPLC analysis as detailed previously. The percentage depolymerization of \nplastic was calculated using the mass of TPA and MHET produced, using the \nconcentrations of each compound as determined by UPLC. For assays under \noptimized conditions, reactions were carried out as above, using a final enzyme \nconcentration of 0.5 μM in pH 9.7, 50 mM Gly-OH buffer, 4% BugBuster.\nFor bottle-grade PET assays, bottle-grade PET pellets (bgPET, RamaPET N1) \nwere micronized using a RETSCH PM100 Planetary Ball Mill at 500 r.p.m. for \n30 min to form a powder. For PET/PE composite packaging tray lid assays, PET/\nPE composite packaging lids, thickness of 325 μM PET and 40 μM PE, were cut into \n6-mm discs. For both materials, 20 mg of the resulting prepared substrates were \nused in reactions, with reaction conditions as described above. Full characterizations \nof the PET substrates described are detailed in Extended Data Table 1.\nChromatographic analysis of reactions. UPLC analysis was carried out on a \n1290 Infinity II Agilent LC system including an autosampler with the ultraviolet \ndetector set to 260 nm, using a Kinetex XB-C18 100 Å, 5 µm, 50 × 2.1 mm, LC \nColumn with a stepped, isocratic solvent ratio method. Mobile phase A was water \ncontaining 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with a fixed flow \nrate of 1.1 ml min\n−1. Either 1 or 4 μl of sample was injected for library screening \nreactions or time-resolved purified protein assays, respectively. Following \nsample injection, the mobile phase was set to 13% buffer B for 52 s to separate \nTPA and MHET, stepped up to 95% buffer B for 33 s to separate larger reaction \nproducts and contaminants, and then stepped back down to 13% buffer B for \ncolumn re-equilibration until a total run time of 1.8 min. Peaks were assigned by \ncomparison to chemical standards prepared from commercial TPA and in-house \nsynthesized MHET, and the peak areas integrated using Agilent OpenLab software. \nUsing this method, TPA is eluted at roughly 0.4 min, MHET at around 0.6 min and \nsmall amounts of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and longer oligomers \nat around 1–1.2 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). TPA and MHET concentrations were \ncalculated by preparation of standard curves (Supplementary Fig. 21).\nNATuRE CATALySiS | VOL 5 | AUGUSt 2022 | 673–681 | www.nature.com/ natcatal 679\nArticles Nature Catalysis\nCharacterization of PET substrates pre- and post-degradation. Polymer \ncrystallinity was determined using DSC, using 4 mg of material. DSC data were \nobtained from using a DSC 2500 TA instrument. Samples were run in triplicate, \nin series, over a −50 to 300 °C temperature range under a nitrogen atmosphere \nat a heating rate of ±10 °C min\n−1 in a 40 μl aluminium crucible. The number and \nweight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of polymer chains were determined \nby SEC. Samples (4 mg) were dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol (120 μl) at \nroom temperature. Once dissolved, HPLC-grade chloroform (1,880 μl) was \nadded to form a uniform, colourless solution that was filtered through a 0.24 μm \npolytetrafluoroethylene filter. SEC analysis was conducted on a system composed \nof an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with an Agilent guard column \n(PLGel 5 μm, 50 × 7.5 mm) and two Agilent Mixed-C columns (PLGel 5 μm, \n300 × 7.5 mm). The mobile phase used was HPLC-grade CHCl\n3 at 35 °C at flow rate \nof 1.0 ml min−1. SEC samples were calibrated against linear polystyrene standards \n(162–2.4 × 105 g mol−1).\nSEM analysis of enzymatic depolymerizations of PET/PE composite packaging. \nA section of a PET/PE packaging lid (710 mg) was fully submerged in reaction \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, 50 ml total) in a glass bottle, and \nHotPETase (0.04 μM final concentration) added to initiate the reaction. Reactions \nwere incubated at either 40 or 60 °C with agitation at 120 r.p.m. The PET/PE \npackaging lid portion was washed and a fresh buffer and enzyme solution added \neach day over the course of 6 days. The control reactions were run in an identical \nmanner, but with no enzyme added. The percentage depolymerization of the \nPET portion of each lid section was estimated from the release of MHET and \nTPA monomers, determined by UPLC analysis of the reaction supernatant taken \neach day, assuming an estimated 12.6 g l\n−1 PET substrate loading. The extent of \ndepolymerization was further confirmed by weight loss analysis of samples before \nand after biotransformations. Samples were analysed by SEM as follows: polymer \nsamples were sputter coated with Au/Pd (thickness 5 nm) to prevent charging \nduring SEM imaging and were observed using secondary electron imaging in a \nTescan SC Mira, FEG-SEM with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and probe current \nof approximately 2 nA.\nProtein melting temperature (T\nm) analysis. The melting temperatures (Tm)  \nof IsPETase and its variants were determined using differential scanning \nfluorimetry. For each protein, a 50 μl sample of 5 μM protein was prepared in  \nbuffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) with a final concentration of 10X SYPRO  \nOrange dye stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in an optically clear, lidded PCR \ntube (Bio-rad). Differential scanning fluorimetry melt-curve experiments were \nconducted using a Bio-rad CFX Connect 96 Real-Time PCR system set on  \nthe fluorescence resonance energy transfer channel to use the 450/490 excitation \nand 560/580 emission filters. The temperature was increased from 25 to  \n95 °C with an increment of 0.3 °C s\n−1. Each protein’s Tm was determined from a \nmean value for the peak of the first derivative of the melt curve from three  \nreplicate measurements.\nStructure determination of HotPETase. Protein crystallization of HotPETase \nwas achieved by sitting drop vapour diffusion of 20 nl of 6 mg ml\n−1 protein mixed \nwith an equal volume of reservoir solution and incubated at 20 °C. Crystals \nwere observed after 72 h incubation with a reservoir solution comprising 0.85 M \nsodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0 and 0.1 M sodium chloride \n(LMB screen HT96 H7 Molecular Dimensions). Before data collection, crystals \nwere cryogentically protected with the addition of 20% PEG 200 to the mother \nliquor and plunge cooled in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at Diamond \nLight Source. Data reduction was performed with Dials and the structure \nsolved by molecular replacement using a search model derived from Is PETase\nWT \nstructure PDB 5XJH. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement were \nperformed in COOT and Phenix using phenix.refine and phenix.ensemble_\nrefinement.

We selected a \nrationally designed, thermostabilized variant of Is PETase contain-\ning three mutations, S121E, D186H, R280A (Is PETaseTS, melting \ntemperature (Tm) of 56.8 °C),24 as a starting point for engineering. \nConsistent with previous reports, IsPETaseTS displays superior PET \ndegradation activity compared to the wild-type enzyme at 40 °C; \nhowever, this activity decreases dramatically at more elevated tem -\nperatures (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nOur first objective was to develop a high-throughput screening \nworkflow to underpin the directed evolution study. To this end, indi-\nvidual enzyme variants were evaluated as crude cell lysates arrayed \nin 96-deep-well plates, using amorphous PET film (amoPET, 6.7% \ncrystallinity, sourced from Goodfellow as a preform sheet) as the \nreaction substrate. The amoPET substrate allowed us to prepare \nuniform 6 mm diameter discs that could be easily placed into indi\n-\nvidual wells to allow fair comparison of variant activity (Fig. 1). We \nfound that the addition of our standard chemical cell lysis reagents, \nlysozyme and polymyxin B, resulted in the production of a lysate \nwith substantially reduced activity (Supplementary Fig. 2), hence, we \ndeveloped a method for 96-well plate cell lysis using the commercial \nreagent, BugBuster. The accumulation of mono(2-hydroxyethyl) \nterephthalate (MHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) in the reaction \nsupernatant was monitored by ultra performance liquid chroma\n-\ntography (UPLC); these two products result from the partial and \ncomplete hydrolysis of the PET backbone, respectively, and are \nthe known major products of Is PETase-mediated depolymeriza\n-\ntions18,31. Using the UPLC method developed here, the MHET and \nTPA produced by a single degradation reaction can be analysed \nin under 2 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using our integrated, \nautomated system, over 2,000 enzyme variants can be assessed for \nplastic deconstruction activity in around 2 days.\nThe evolutionary strategy comprised sequential rounds of satu\n-\nration mutagenesis, using degenerate NNK codons to individually \nrandomize between 24–30 residue positions per cycle. In total, 106 \nof the 264 residues present in Is PETase were targeted for mutation \nthroughout evolution. Residues were selected for randomization on \nthe basis of a number of considerations, including their identifica\n-\ntion by online protein stability-enhancing tools, visual inspection \nof the protein crystal structure or previous reports of their involve\n-\nment in substrate binding or thermostability (Supplementary Table \n1). In each round of evolution, around the top 3% of hits were \nassessed as purified enzymes. Beneficial mutations found were then \ncombined by DNA shuffling, and the resulting variants assayed as \npurified proteins to identify the most active sequence, which was \nthen used as a template for the next round of evolution.

Depiction of the laboratory evolution workflow for a single well in a 96-deep-well \nplate. Enzymatic PEt depolymerizations mainly produce MHEt, tPA and ethylene glycol (EG). the example UPLC trace demonstrates the MHEt and tPA \nproduced following a 5 h PEt degradation reaction of semicrystalline PEt powder (cryPEt), with absorbance on the y axis in milli-absorbance units (mAu) \nand retention time on the x axis in minutes (min). Reactions were carried out at 70 °C, with both the best variant following evolution, HotPEtase (pink), \nand the starting protein IsPEtase\ntS (yellow) using 0.4% cryPEt substrate loading (4 g l−1) and 0.29 mg g−1 enzyme loading (0.04 μM). the crystal structure \nshows the 21 amino acid positions mutated from IsPEtaseWt: three positions mutated in the starting protein IsPEtasetS (yellow spheres), 16 installed \nthrough evolution (pink spheres) and a rationally installed disulfide bridge (black spheres). the catalytic triad and W185 are shown with a ball and stick \nrepresentation in blue and grey, respectively.\nNATuRE CATALySiS | VOL 5 | AUGUSt 2022 | 673–681 | www.nature.com/ natcatal674\nArticlesNature Catalysis\nrounds 2 and 3, an additional disulfide bridge (N233C, S282C) was \nrationally generated in the protein, following reports that the inclu-\nsion of this structural feature increased protein stability in homolo-\ngous, promiscuous PET-degrading cutinases16,32, leading to a 5.5 °C \nincrease in Tm (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).\nTo simultaneously improve both thermostability and activity, \nthe evolutionary pressures applied were gradually changed across \nrounds by raising both the reaction temperature and extending the \nreaction time. For rounds 1–4, the primary focus was on improved \ncatalysis at elevated temperatures. Cell lysates were pre-incubated \nat sequentially higher temperatures (from 55–75 °C) for 1 h, before \nconducting PET depolymerization reactions for 3 h. The reaction \ntemperature also increased from 55–70 °C during these rounds \n(Supplementary Table 1). Once a satisfactory level of thermostabil\n-\nity was achieved, additional selection pressures of catalyst longevity \nand activity on more crystalline material were added. To this end, \nreactions in rounds 5 and 6 were conducted at 70 °C, with reaction \ntimes of 5 and 7 h, respectively, initially using amoPET as the sub\n-\nstrate. The top 3% of clones identified during rounds 5 and 6 were \nthen screened as purified enzymes against a commercially available \nsemicrystalline PET powder (cryPET, 29.8% crystallinity, sourced \nfrom Goodfellow) that has a crystallinity level more reminiscent of \nmaterial dominant in postconsumer waste streams\n33,34.\nThe most thermostable and active variant to emerge following six \nrounds of evolution, HotPETase, contains 21 mutations compared \nto IsPETaseWT: three from the starting protein template IsPETaseTS, \ntwo from the rational insertion of an additional disulfide bridge and \na further 16 found through directed evolution (Fig. 1 and Extended \nData Fig. 1). HotPETase has a melting temperature of 82.5 °C, the \nhighest Tm recorded so far of an active Is PETase derivative. This \nelevated thermostability means that the enzyme can be incubated \nbefore reaction at 75 °C for 90 min with only a 6% loss of activity \nover 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 4). Enzyme pre-incubation at 80 °C \nfor 90 min resulted in a more substantial 35% reduction in activity. \nAssessment of variants along the evolutionary trajectory demon -\nstrated that evolution led to progressive improvements in both ther-\nmostability and activity in cryPET deconstruction assays performed \nat 60 °C (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). While Is PETase\nWT and \nIsPETaseTS have minimal activity at 60 °C, HotPETase operated well \nunder these conditions.\nBiochemical characterization. We next determined the activity \nof HotPETase across a range of temperatures by monitoring the \nrelease of MHET and TPA over time (Fig. 2b). For comparison, \nanalogous experiments were performed using the starting template, \nIsPETase\nTS, and the engineered thermostable cutinase LCC ICCG  \n(ref. 16). Comparisons between LCCICCG and IsPETase variants were \ncarried out under the optimal buffer conditions for each individual \nprotein16,18, using cryPET powder as the substrate (Supplementary \nFig. 5). At 40 °C, slightly improved initial reaction rates were \nachieved by HotPETase versus IsPETaseTS (Fig. 2b), demonstrating \nthat the evolution of thermostability has not compromised activity at \nambient temperatures. While the activity of IsPETase\nTS was severely \ncompromised at higher temperatures, the rate of PET hydrolysis by \nHotPETase is substantially improved by operating at temperatures \napproaching the reported T\ng of PET in aqueous solutions (around \n60–65 °C)14. At 65 °C, each mole of HotPETase releases 2.7 × 104 M \nof monomers in 1 hour, a time-course over which reaction progres-\nsion is linear. At the same temperature LCC ICCG produced 5.7 × 103 \nmoles of monomer product in the same time frame, highlighting \nthe superior catalytic activity of this engineered IsPETase. For both \nHotPETase and LCCICCG, the reaction rates were slightly reduced at \n70 versus 65 °C.\nComparison of reactions with HotPETase and Is PETaseTS at \n40 °C show that evolution has afforded a more robust catalyst \nwith increased longevity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2). For \nIsPETaseTS, soluble product formation essentially ceases after 8 h. In \ncontrast, for reactions with HotPETase, monomeric products con -\ntinue to accumulate for more than 48 h. Consistent with previous \nstudies26, the reaction profile is non-linear with faster initial phase \nfor roughly 8 h, followed by a slower phase from 8–48 h. Similar, \nbut more pronounced, non-linear reaction profiles are observed at \nelevated temperatures (from 60–70 °C, Extended Data Fig. 2). The \ntime-course of reactions with HotPETase at 65 °C demonstrate that \nproduct accumulation rises rapidly for the first of 3 h of reaction \n(1.51 mM of MHET + TPA), but then slows substantially after this \ntime, producing 1.61 mM of soluble monomers over 48 h (Fig. 2d). \nAs a result, while PET depolymerization with HotPETase is substan-\ntially faster at 65 °C, the extent of depolymerization at longer time \nframes is greater at 40 °C (Fig. 2c,d).\nProduct accumulation over time is also non-linear for LCCICCG in \nreactions at 65 °C, with 0.68 and 1.78 mM of monomers produced \nover 5 and 48 h, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3). It is interest -\ning to note that HotPETase operating at 40 °C deconstructs cry -\nPET more efficiently than LCC ICCG at 65 °C, both with respect to \ninitial rate and extent of depolymerization over 48 h. HotPETase \nalso depolymerizes amoPET discs (used for library screening) more \neffectively than LCC\nICCG across a range of temperatures from 40 to \n65 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6). At 70 °C, although HotPETase pro -\nduces more soluble monomers than LCC ICCG over 3 h, at this tem -\nperature over 24 h, LCC ICCG is a more effective depolymerase of \namoPET due to its enhanced longevity.\nTo understand the origins of the non-linear reaction profiles of \nHotPETase, particularly at elevated temperatures, we conducted \nexperiments to supply additional enzyme or substrate once reaction \nprogression had ceased. Addition of fresh HotPETase, following \ncryPET depolymerization for 24 h at 60 °C, leads to similar prod\n-\nuct accumulation versus time trends as observed at the outset of \nthe reaction (Extended Data Fig. 4). In contrast, addition of fresh \nPET substrate does not give rise to any additional soluble products. \nThese observations suggest that reactions stall due to catalyst deac\n-\ntivation, not as a result of inhibition by soluble released products or \nexhaustion of available plastic substrate. It is interesting to note that \nduring evolution, IsPETase libraries were analysed over time frames \nranging from 3 to 7 h, meaning that limited selection pressure was \napplied to catalyst longevity at elevated temperatures. We anticipate \nthat adapting selection pressures during future rounds of evolution \nwill lead to improved variants capable of operating efficiently at \nelevated temperatures for more extended periods.\nTo further explore the use of HotPETase, we next attempted \nto deconstruct commercial-grade PET materials. HotPETase can \ndepolymerize milled bottle-grade PET (bgPET, 41.9% crystallinity, \nfull material characterization can be found in Extended Data Table 1 \nand Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), albeit with a reduced conversion \ncompared to that observed with cryPET powder (Fig. 3) (9.7 and \n2.8% with cryPET and bgPET, respectively). To showcase the selec\n-\ntivity achievable with biocatalytic depolymerizations, HotPETase \nwas used to deconstruct a common laminated packaging tray lid \ncomposed of PET and polyethylene (PE) (1.6% crystallinity, thick\n-\nness of 325 μm PET and 40 μm PE, Extended Data Table 1). This \nPET/PE laminate is challenging to recycle mechanically, and indeed \nis considered a pollutant in commercial recycling streams. The \nHotPETase enzyme is adept at selectively deconstructing the PET \nportion of this material. In this instance, the extent of depolymeriza\n-\ntion after 24 h is substantially improved at 60 versus 40 °C (9.2 versus \n2.9 mM of soluble monomer products released, corresponding to a \ndegree of depolymerization of 48.1 and 15.3%, respectively, Fig. 3a  \nand Extended Data Fig. 5). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \nreveals significant pitting of the PET surface, whereas the PE sur\n-\nface appears unchanged, compared to control reactions run in the \nabsence of enzyme (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9).

Under optimal conditions using \n3.62 mg g\n−1 HotPETase enzyme loading (0.5 μM) and cryPET as \nthe substrate (0.4% cryPET substrate loading (4 g l−1), 20 mg total), \n6.07 mM of soluble monomer products were formed (MHET:TPA \nratio of 1:0.29) within 5 h at 60 °C, corresponding to a degree of depo-\nlymerization of 31% (Extended Data Fig. 6). Differential scanning \ncalorimetry (DSC) analysis of samples before and after depolymer\n-\nization show an overall increase in crystallinity from 29.8 to 41.7%, \nsuggesting that HotPETase preferentially degrades the amorphous \nPET domains (Supplementary Fig. 13a and Extended Data Table 2). \nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis shows no substantive \nchange in the molecular weight and dispersity of the remaining PET \n(Supplementary Fig. 13b), which may indicate that the enzyme oper\n-\nates in an exo-cleavage fashion, depolymerizing individual polymer \nchains fully before chain transfer to a new macromolecule, thus retain\n-\ning the original chain lengths in the bulk of the sample. Applying the \noptimized reaction conditions for cryPET depolymerization to alterna\n-\ntive PET materials (bgPET and PET/PE laminate film) fails to enhance \nthe rate or extent of depolymerization at 60 °C (Extended Data Fig. 5), \nsuggesting that optimal process conditions are highly dependent on \nthe characteristics of the material undergoing deconstruction.\nStructural analysis.

The ‘wobbling’ tryptophan, Trp185, a feature that is thought \nto aid substrate binding and catalysis in the wild-type enzyme\n20,35, \nis present as a single conformer in apo -HotPETase and is suitably \npositioned to accommodate the docked 4PET in a productive pose \nfor catalysis (Fig. 4b). Extensive remodelling of the loop region con-\nnecting β7-α5, including introduction of a bulky Tyr214, leads to \na new π-stacking interaction with Trp185 that restricts its confor -\nmational freedom (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7d). A hydro -\ngen bonding network involving Trp185, Tyr214 and the terminal \nhydroxyl group of 4PET also contributes to the stabilization of the \ndocked oligomer within the binding cleft.\n0.1\n0.3\n0.5\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n8.0\n5 h\n24 h\n5 h\n24 h\n5 h\n24 h\nMHET + TPA released (mM)\nMHET\nTPA\ncryPET\npowder\nMilled bottle-\ngrade PET\nPET/PE\ncomposite film\nPE\nPET\n+ HotPETase No enzyme\na b\nFig. 3 | Biocatalytic deconstruction of a range of PET-based materials by HotPET ase. a, Bar chart showing the mean concentration of released PEt \ndegradation products, MHEt (blue) and tPA (yellow), produced following reaction of HotPEtase at 60 °C over the course of 24 h, using 0.4% total \nsubstrate loading (4 g l−1) and 0.29 mg g−1 enzyme loading (0.04 μM).

These modifications led to a substantial \n7.5 °C reduction in T m and compromised catalytic performance at \nelevated temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 8). Catalytic activity at \nlow temperatures is minimally affected, suggesting that in the heav-\nily engineered HotPETase, the fixed conformation of Trp185 is not \ndetrimental to catalysis.

However, the engineering of \nindustrial biocatalysts is most commonly achieved through directed \nevolution. The notable lack of PETases engineered using laboratory \nevolution probably reflects the challenges of developing suitable \nhigh-throughput, quantitative methods for analysing the catalytic \ndeconstruction of insoluble polymers. Here, we have developed \nan automated directed evolution platform for engineering plastic \ndeconstructing enzymes and showcase its use through the develop\n-\nment of an evolved thermostable PETase (HotPETase, Tm = 82.5 °C), \nthat can operate at the glass transition temperature of PET and \ndepolymerizes semicrystalline PET more rapidly than previously \nreported PETases. HotPETase is able to deconstruct commercial \nbottle-grade PET and can selectively deconstruct PET in a PET/\nPE laminated packaging material, highlighting the potential ben\n-\nefits of enzymatic depolymerizations for real-world samples with \nminimal pretreatment or processing. Structural characterization \nof HotPETase highlights formation of the intended Cys233-Cys282 \ndisulfide bridge and improved packing of the central β-sheet region, \nwhich probably aids thermostability, alongside the presence of a sin\n-\ngle well-defined conformer of Trp185, indicating that flexibility of \nthis tryptophan is not a prerequisite for effective catalysis. To maxi\n-\nmize the use of our platform moving forward, it will be important \nto interface our evolution methods with alternative strategies for \naugmenting biocatalyst function, including computationally guided \nengineering\n36, introduction of polymer binding domains 37 and the \ndevelopment of multienzyme complexes38. Likewise, combining and \noptimizing biocatalytic deconstructions with enzymatic monomer \nupcycling methods will be an important avenue for exploration39,40. \nIn all cases, detailed techno-economic and life-cycle analysis will \nplay a crucial role in assessing commercial viability, as well as defin-\ning target parameters for future biocatalyst engineering7,8.\nIn the future, we anticipate that by adapting the selection pres -\nsures of our directed evolution workflows, we will be able to engi -\nneer a suite of useful biocatalysts with complementary functions \nand improved activities under process-relevant conditions. For \nexample, we can extend catalyst stability and lifetime by increas\n-\ning reaction times and temperatures, optimize biocatalysts to act \non alternative plastic substrates or enhance enzyme specificities in \norder that they operate on single polymer components from mixed \nplastic waste streams. In doing so, our laboratory evolution platform \nwill contribute to a biocatalytic recycling strategy to recover value \nfrom plastic waste."}

These \npublicly available metagenomes were used to prepare a gene \ncatalog of 83 million non-redundant gene clusters, where each \ncluster contained nucleotide sequences with ≥95% sequence \nidentity ov er≥90% of their length. The gene catalogs were\nannotated using the KAUST Metagenomic Analyses Platform\n(KMAP) [\n39] and screened for sequences similar to theI. sakaiensis\nPETase [7] (IsPETase EC 3.1.1.101)-like enzymes. Specifically , we \nsearched for genes encoding enzymes that contain the DLH \ndomain, a generic α/β-hydrolase fold found in over 80,000 \nprotein sequences in the UniPro tKB database. The DLH domain-\ncontaining sequences search identified 75 representative gene\nclusters in our metagenomic catalogs (\nSupplementary Data S1 ). \nAlthough these sequences contain a DLH domain, they may \nnot necessarily be PETases. Following our motif ranking, w e\nformulated filters as five motifs (M1–M5) with increasing\nstringency (\nFig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S6). The first motif, M1, \nonly queries for a short and promiscuous PETase-associated motif \nderived from helix-4 that carries the catalytic serine. M2 improves\nIdentifying functional marine PETases | 7\nthe M1 filter by adding a search for a conserved four glycine motif \n(GGGG) that is required for embedding the helix-4 into the protein \ncore and by adding two signatures, one for the aromatic clamp \nof PET substrates and one for the catalytic aspartic acid. Motif \nM3 adds the previous signatures for the entire catalytic triad \n(including the histidine), and M4 includes the [PG]-G-[YF] motif \nthat defines an additional aromatic clamp and oxyanion hole \nupstream in the catalytic triad. M5 strictly defines the residue\nafter the catalytic serine as a methionine (oxyanion hole) and\nadds a conserved DxDxR (Y) xxFxC sequence requirement. The\nM5 motif ensures correct pseudo-PETase packing of the final\nhelix to the core and includes one of the two cysteines that\nform a stabilizing internal disulfide bond [\n29]. Among these \nmotifs, M3–M5 contain the complete catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, \nand His residues) and define the sequence- and structure-guided\nminimum and maximum residue distances between individual\nmotifs (\nSupplementary Figs S7 and S8). When searching for these \nmotifs within our 75 PETase candidate genes, we identified 4, 3, 16, \n29, and 23 representative sequences that contained (up to) the M1,\nM2, M3, M4, or M5 motif, respectively (Supplementary Data S1 ). \nSignal peptides for extracellular translocation (required for \nPETase to access the extracellular plastic) were detected in 22 \nout of 23 M5-PETase sequence variants, wher eas their presence\nwas variable in sequences with lower motif ranking (M1–M4)\n(\nSupplementary Table S2). \nWe further computed a RaxML–based bootstrapped p hylo-\ngenetic tree [48] with the 75 PETase candidates, the IsPET ase\nsequence [7], eight terrestrial homologs reported in the UniProt\ndatabase [29], and 12 non-PETase DLH domain core sequences \nfrom the Pfam database as an outgroup (Fig. 1B). The resulting \nphylogenetic tree identified the 12 non-PETase DLH domain core \nsequences as a parental group for the candidate PETase genes, \nhereafter defined as clade I. All the other clusters represent\nsix additional taxonomic clades that differentially contain\nthe five motifs (\nFig. 1B). Specifically , clade II is dominated by \nOceanospirialles (M3 and M4), clades III and IV include a mixture \nof taxa but are dominated by Flavobacteriales (M2–M4), clade V \ncontains GemmatimonadotaandGammaproteobacteria(M1–M5), and\nclade VI contains previously defined homologs ofIsPETase from\nland microorganisms [\n29]. The clade VII is formed by the original \nIsPETase sequence along with several sequences belonging to the \nPseudomonadales order within the Gammaproteobacteria class; all \ncontain the M5 motif except three sequences that were identified\nas M2, M3, and M4, respectively (\nFig. 1B). \nIn addition to the motif filters, we established a theoretical \nPETase “efficiency score” (see Materials and methods) based \non the presence of residue substitutions that were previousl y\nidentified as enhancing PETase activity in engineered laboratory\nvariants of theIsPETase [\n58] ( Supplementary Table S1 and \nData S2 ). The substitutions increase the hydrophobicity of the \nligand binding site and reduce the steric hindrance around \nthe active site to facilitate substrate accumulation near the\nbinding cleft (\nSupplementary Result S1 ). This score is non-\noverlapping with the residues probed by the M1–M5 filters and \nis expected to reflect the efficacy , rather than capability , of \nusing hydrophobic polymers such as PET as a substrate. By \nranking the 75 PETases representatives from ocean metagenomes,\nwe found that the highest efficacy scores (scores 9–11;\nFig. 1C \nand Supplementary Data S2 ) were only achieved by sequences \nfrom Pseudomonadales, all but two (one M4 and one M2) of \nthem were identified as M5 in our structure-based motif \nsearch. All the other sequences had eff icacy scores lower\nthan four and belonged to the M1–M4 motif classes, with\nthe exception of the M5-PETases encoded byGemmatimonadota\nbacteria (\nSupplementary Data S2 ). The latter has the back \nof the ligand binding site formed by glutamic acid and his-\ntidine rather than alanine/tryptophan as inIs-WT (A89 and\nW159)/PseudomonadalesM5, negatively affecting PETase activity\n[\n44]. \nM5-polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase have \npolyethylene terephthalate-degrading activityin\nvitro\nWe tested the catalytic activity of PETase motif candidates in vitro. \nWe recombinantly produced 11 ocean DLH genes, with motifs \nranging from M1 to M5. We also produced the IsPETase (Is-WT) \nand its catalytically impaired S160A mutant (Is-S160A) as positive\nand negative controls, respectively (\nSupplementary Data S3). All \nrecombinant proteins were purified to>90% ( Supplementary \nFig. S2A). The obtained proteins of the IsPET ase and ocean DLH \nvariants with M5 and M4 motifs sho wed melting temperatures\n(T\nm) between 47–51◦C( Supplementary Fig. S2B ), whereas the \nTm of all M1–M3 enzymes range between 31 ◦C a n d 4 2◦C. The \napparent molecular weight on SDS PAGE gel and AlphaFold \nmodeling confirmed that the lower stability of the M1–M3\nenzymes is explained by truncations compared toIs-WT\n(\nSupplementary Fig. S2A). The generic p-nitrophenol acyl esterase \nactivity assay showed positive activity for all the M5-DLH variants \ntested, although their degradation efficiency was 25–50% lower\nthanIs-WT (\nFig. 2A and B). Degradation and structural alterations \nof PET substrate were also observed for both PET films and \ngranules, on which M5 enzymes produced characteristic scr atch\nmarks that progressively deepened and widened over time (\nFig. 2C \nand D). This enzymatic activity led to the release of PET monomers \nand by-products, including terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-\nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) (Fig. 2C–F; molecular weight \nstandards in Supplementary Fig. S5 ). On the contrary , neither \nIs-S160A nor any M1–M4 enzymes sho wed activity in this assay\n(Supplementary Fig. S9). DLH variants demonstrating activity in \nin vitro functional assays all contained the M5 motif and belonged\nto clade VII in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B), i.e. PETase_10.M5, \nPETase_12.M5 and PETase_15.M5 assessed in this study (Fig. 2)a n d \nPETase_02.M5 previously tested [46]. Thus, we concluded that only \nthe M5 variants were functional PET ases (hereafter M5-PETases).\nIn vivo polyethylene terephthalate degradation \nby bacteria encoding a full M5-pol yethylene\nterephthalate hydrolase gene\nTo validate M5-PETase activity in vivo, we conducted proof-\nof-concept experiments by assessing PET film degradation in \nmicrocosms inoculated with bacterial isolates from the marine\nculture collection of heterotrophic bacteria (MARINHET) [ 52]. \nBased on initial PCR-based screening, we identified six positive\nstrains (Supplementary Table S3 ), of which three were selected \nto assess their PETase motif from genome sequencing and \ncapabilities to degrade PET: ISS-721 isolated from 4,000 m \ndepth in the South Atlantic (Malaspina Expedition), and ISS-\n1225 and ISS-1242 captured from surface w ater (5 m) in the\nNorth Atlantic (TaraOceans). All three isolates were identified\nasPseudomonasspp., recently reclassified asHalopseudomonas\nspp. [\n54] (Supplementary Fig. S3). Analysis of bacterial assembled\ngenomes (Supplementary Method S1) revealed that only ISS-1242 \nencodes a complete M5-PETase motif, identical to PETase_12.M5\nfromH. pachastrellae( Fig. 1B), including both a complete catalytic \nfold and a secretion signal peptide (Supplementary Result S2\nand Figs S10 and S11). In contrast, the other two strains possess\n8 | Alamet al.\nFigure 2.

This is consistent \nwith the absence of a MHET ase gene in the selected strains\n(Supplementary Result S2 ), which is required to facilitate the \nassimilation of PET by-products. Only strain ISS-1242—which was \npredicted through genome analysis to encode a functional M5-\nPETase—exhibited a significant reduction in PET weight compared\nto negative controls without bacterial inoculation (2.7%±0.5%\nat 85 days,\nFig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S12 ), with the highest \ndegradation efficiency observed when using f iltered/autoclaved\nseawater (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). In contrast, PET degradation \nby ISS-721 and ISS-1225 was negligible (< 0.5% over 85 days), \nwith a non-significant differentiation from the negative controls\n(t-test at 64 days, ISS-721 vs control:t= 1.8, df = 4,P=. 1 4 ;\nIdentifying functional marine PETases | 9\nFigure 3.

Such minor and \ninconsistent variations in PET film weight may be attributed to \nfactors unrelated to PETase enzymatic activity , including, among \nothers, nonspecific microbial metabolism (e.g. acidification of the \nmedium), mechanical abrasion due to agitation, or the activity \nof other ester ases with broader substrate specificity . Microcosms\ninoculated withE. colishowed no PET degradation activity with\nvalues comparable to negative controls (t= 1.7, df = 4,P= .16;\nSupplementary Fig. S12). HPLC confirmed the degradation of the \nPET film with the formation of mainly TP A, whereas MHET was\npresent in low quantity (Fig. 3B). The PET -degrading strain ISS-\n1242 colonized the PET film surface, forming small and sep arate\ncolonies without creating a homogeneous biofilm (Fig. 3C), as pre-\nviously observed for other marine degraders [59]. Magnifications \nat single-cell resolution revealed that bacteria were anch ored\nto the PET film ( Fig. 3D), resulting in surface alteration with \nirregularities, erosion, deposits, cavities, and fissures ( Fig. 3D) \ncompared with control films (Supplementary Fig. S13). \nThe in vivo functional assay revealed that only bacteria encod-\ning enzymes with the complete M5 motif—along with a sig-\nnal peptide enabling extracellular secretion—exhibited signifi-\ncant PET -degrading activity , confirming the results ofin vitro\nassays (\nFig. 2) and the overall motif ranking to determine func-\ntional PETase variants proposed.\nDistribution and abundance of M5-polyethylene \nterephthalate h ydrolase in the global ocean\nWe analysed the distribution patterns and prevalence of M5-\nPETase variants across 415 marine metagenomes. To ensure \ncomparability across samples and account for variations in \nmicrobial load, the relative abundance of M5-PETase genes was\ncalculated as FPKM and normalized against the FPKM of the\nsingle-copy housekeeping generecA(\nSupplementary Data S4). The \nM5-PETase variants were affiliated with the order Pseudomonadales \n(18 variants) and the phylumGemmatimonadota(5 variants)\n("}
