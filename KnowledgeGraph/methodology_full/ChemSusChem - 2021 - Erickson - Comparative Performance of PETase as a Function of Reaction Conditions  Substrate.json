      "text": "Structural and biophysical comparison of the W159H/S238F\nvariant of IsPETase reveals conformational and stability\nchanges compared to the WT\nTo compare structural differences between the WT and DM, a\nhigh-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the DM was solved\nwith diffraction data extending to a resolution of 1.45 \u00c5 (PDB\nID: 7OSB) (Figure 1, Figure S1, Table S1). The two amino acid\nsubstitutions (W159H/S238F) (Figure 1) in the DM induce\nnarrowing of the active site cleft (Figure 1B) compared to the\nWT enzyme (PDB ID: 6EQE)\n[6]\n(Figure 1E), and otherwise result in\nminimal conformational changes to the structure (Figure S2).\nDespite the small change in overall structure, these point\nmutations have a marked effect on the thermal stability of the\nDM enzyme relative to the WT (Figure 1D, Figure S3). The\napparent T\nm\nof the WT is 46.76 \ufffd 0.04 \u00b0 C, measured by differ-\nential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while the apparent T\nm\nof the\nDM is 56.49 \ufffd 0.22 \u00b0 C (Figure 1D). In comparing the thermody-\nnamic stability (resistance to thermal unfolding) of each enzyme\nas a function of temperature, the WT and DM enzymes have\ncomparable stability at 30 \u00b0 C (Figure S3A). As the temperature\nincreases, the relative stability of the DM compared to the WT\nincreases, reaching a maximum relative difference in stability at\n47 \u00b0 C (Figure S3B). At 47 \u00b0 C, the WT has a 19 fold increased\npropensity for thermal denaturation compared to the DM at the\nsame temperature.\nSubstrates used in this study include amorphous and\ncrystalline PET\nThe primary PET substrates utilized for all studies include an\namorphous film (2.0 \ufffd 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented\nfilm (30.7 \ufffd 5.5 % crystallinity), and a crystalline powder (37.7 \ufffd\n2.6 % crystallinity), all sourced from Goodfellow, unless noted\notherwise. Detailed characterization of each substrate used in\nthese studies was performed (Table S2).\n[9a]\nDMSO in the reaction mixture promotes conversion of\namorphous PET film\nPET hydrolysis reaction parameters reported in the literature\nvary widely. In some studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is\nincluded in the reaction\n[3,4,6,11]\nto promote solubility of liberated\nmonomers. In other studies, DMSO is not included,\n[2a,b,7,12]\nleading us to study the influence of DMSO on PET conversion.\nLikewise, some studies have included agitation of the reaction\nto facilitate mass transfer and promote association between the\nenzyme and the substrate.\n[12,13]\nTo understand if either inclusion\nof DMSO in the reaction mixture or agitation of the reaction\nduring hydrolysis appreciably influence the extent of PET\nconversion, we compared reactions over 96 h using both the\nWT and DM incubated at 30 and 40 \u00b0 C (Figure 2, Figure S4). All\nreactions were performed using 1 mg g\n\u0000 1\nenzyme loading and\n2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) substrate loading of an amorphous PET\nFigure 1.

The reaction buffer\nfor samples without DMSO (\u0000 DMSO) was 50 mm NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n,\n100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The solvent inclusion condition (+ DMSO)\nwas performed using a buffer comprising 90 % (v/v) 50 mm\nNaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 100 mm NaCl, 10 % (v/v) DMSO, pH 7.5. Agitation was\nperformed using an incubated orbital shaker at 225 rpm.\nIn comparing product release between PET substrates, this\nstudy highlights the impact of substrate selection on conversion\nextent. For both enzymes in most reaction conditions, a 2\u20135\nfold increase in total product release is measured for reactions\ncontaining crystalline powder compared to the same mass\nloading of an amorphous film (Figure 2). These results also\nhighlight that the WT and the DM have different temperature-\ndependent activity profiles, where a change of 10 \u00b0 C in the\nreaction temperature has a larger differential effect on catalytic\nperformance for the DM at 48 and 96 h reaction times.\nIn general, product release was highest in the presence of\nDMSO, while agitation resulted in slightly less product release,\non average. Reactions without DMSO tended to reach a lower\nPET conversion extent over 48 and 96 h, which is most apparent\nfor reactions with amorphous PET. The DM enzyme on\ncrystalline PET exhibits the least variation in PET conversion\nacross all four conditions tested (Figure 2G, H). As the + DMSO/-\nAgitation condition generally resulted in the highest PET\nconversion, all subsequent reactions presented subsequently\nwere performed using this reaction condition, unless noted\notherwise.\nReaction progress and endpoint analysis reveal differential\nactivity profiles for the WT and DM enzymes\nHydrolytic performance on PET was evaluated for the WT and\nDM at 30 and 40 \u00b0 C to assess how the difference in apparent T\nm\nmight influence the rate and extent of PET conversion. The\nlower temperature is the isolation temperature of the host\norganism\n[3]\nand the typical reaction temperature reported for\nIsPETase activity. The higher temperature, which is below the\napparent T\nm\nof the WT, was selected to identify if increased\ntemperature would result in faster conversion.\nConversion extent was evaluated by substrate mass loss\nand measurement of the aromatic monomers released [as the\nsum of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono(2-\nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and TPA]. The effect of\nreaction temperature was examined over 168 h using two\nenzyme loadings [0.2 mg enzyme g\n\u0000 1\nPET (Figure S5, Table S4)\nand 1.0 mg enzyme g\n\u0000 1\nPET (Figure 3, Table S5)], and a\nsubstrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) of amorphous PET\nfilm. The resulting trend in reaction progress curves is similar\nfor both enzymes at both enzyme loadings, where reactions\nincubated at 40 \u00b0 C accumulate more aromatic product at early\ntime points (< 48 h) (Figure 3A). For the WT, at 40 \u00b0 C product\naccumulation plateaus by 48 h, while at 30 \u00b0 C the enzyme\ncontinues hydrolyzing amorphous PET film through the 168 h\ntimepoint. The DM exhibits low relative activity at 30 \u00b0 C, but at\n40 \u00b0 C remains active through 168 h and accumulates the\nhighest total concentration of aromatic product monomer from\n72 h onward.\nFigure 2. Contribution of agitation and DMSO to product release. Enzymatic conversion of PET reported as the sum of aromatic products released from (A\u2013\nD) an amorphous PET film substrate, and (E\u2013H) a crystalline PET powder substrate at 48 and 96 h for the WT and DM. Graphs show a comparison of reactions\nwith and without 10 % DMSO in the reaction mixture, and with or agitation of the reaction, using an orbital shaker. All reactions were performed in duplicate\nand error bars represent the absolute error between replicates. Progress curves showing aromatic product release over 96 h are available for each dataset in\nFigure S4. Information about statistical analysis of these datasets is in Table S3.

Given the nature of the insoluble PET substrates\nhydrolyzed by these enzymes, achieving the conditions re-\nquired for the convMM reactions is not trivial, and therefore we\nexplored both kinetic models. Using the kinetic parameters\nderived from these models, we can compare the performance\nof each enzyme by comparing affinity between the enzyme and\nthe substrate (\nconv\nK\nm\n, Equation S1 and\ninv\nK\nm\n, Equation S2) and\nmaximal reaction velocity (\nconv\nV\nmax\n, Equation S3 and\ninv\nV\nmax\n,\nEquation S4).\nSpecifically, sacrificial samples were generated for each time\npoint over a reaction time of 6\u201310 h (while initial reaction rates\nremain linear). Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting\nfor both enzymes at 30 and 40 \u00b0 C on two different PET\nsubstrates, amorphous PET film and a crystalline PET powder.\nInitial rate measurements were collected for the convMM\ndataset (Figure 4, Table 1) using 950 nm enzyme and varying\nthe substrate loading over a range of 0\u201311.6 % by mass (0\u2013\n116 g L\n\u0000 1\n) to identify a saturating substrate load, or when\nsubstrate is sufficiently in excess that all enzymes in the\nreaction are engaged. Initial rate measurements were also\ncollected for the invMM dataset (Figure 5, Table 1) using a\nsubstrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) and varying the\nenzyme loading over a range of 0\u20132 mg enzyme per g PET\nFigure 3.

Each reaction contains 1 mg enzyme g\n\u0000 1\nPET and 2.9 % amorphous PET film by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n). Reactions were evaluated\nfor 168 h to compare enzyme stability. (A) Progress curves show variation in total aromatic product release over time for each condition evaluated.

The data are generally well-represented by the\nconventional (Equation S1) and inverse (Equation S2) MM\nequations (Figures 4 and 5). An exception to the conventional\nMM model is observed in the case of WT-40 \u00b0 C on crystalline\nPET powder (Figure 4B). At 40 \u00b0 C, the WT showed the expected\nbehavior at low substrate loadings, but turnover rate decreases\nat higher substrate loadings (Figure 4B), leading to a poor fit of\nEquation S1 (Figure S6, Table S7). This behavior was not\nobserved in previous interfacial kinetics studies using the same\nsubstrate;\n[15]\nhowever, in those studies only the DM was tested\nand the substrate loadings evaluated were much lower,\nencompassing 0\u20130.6 % loading by mass (0\u20136 g L\n\u0000 1\nPET). Data for\nthe convMM plots using WT-40 \u00b0 C on crystalline powder were\nfitted until the drop in turnover rate, from 0\u201358 g L\n\u0000 1\nPET\nloading (Figure 4B).\nThe convMM and invMM datasets for each enzyme/temper-\nature combination are in accord, showing that reaction\nvelocities for the WT and DM are higher on the crystalline\npowder, except in the case of the DM at 30 \u00b0 C. This increased\nreaction velocity is likely due to the higher surface area of the\npowder, and therefore increased availability of reaction sites. It\nis important to note that the powder is more crystalline\n(Table S2), and previous studies suggest that the amorphous\nregions of the polymer are preferentially depolymerized by PET\nhydrolases.\n[16]\nRegardless, the WT and DM generally show higher\naffinity (based on\nconv\nK\nm\nvalues) and catalytic efficiency (based\non the specificity constant =\nconv\nk\ncat\n/\nconv\nK\nm\n, Table S8) for the\npowder substrate compared to the amorphous film. Compar-\nison of derived kinetic parameters from the convMM datasets\n(Table 1) reveals that while there is variation in catalytic rate\n(k\ncat\n) across enzymes, temperatures, and substrates, the range is\nnot overly large. This is unexpected, given the increase in\nreaction temperature.\n[17]\nRather, there is a large variation in\nconv\nK\nm\nacross enzymes and temperatures. The\nconv\nK\nm\nvalues drop\nsignificantly between the 30 and 40 \u00b0 C reactions for both\nenzymes on both substrates, indicating there is a temperature\ndependence for affinity between the enzyme and the substrate.\nOn amorphous film, the specificity constant of the WT\nincubated at 30 \u00b0 C is comparable to the DM incubated at 30 \u00b0 C,\nand similarly WT-40 \u00b0 C is comparable to the DM-40 \u00b0 C (Table S8).\nOn crystalline PET powder, however, the WT has much higher\nspecificity than the DM at both temperatures (Table S8).\nComparison of the derived kinetic parameters from the\ninvMM datasets (Table 1) shows that WT requires less enzyme\nto reach saturation on amorphous PET.

To\nthat end, we measured product release over 96 h for the WT\nenzyme at 30 and 40 \u00b0 C and for the DM enzyme at 40 \u00b0 C,\nevaluating the impact of substrate loading and enzyme loading\non performance over three productivity measures: the rate of\naromatic product release over a designated reaction duration\n(24 h in Figure 6A, D, G, 10 and 48 h in Figures S7 and S8), the\nrate of product release per unit of enzyme (Figure 6B, E, H), and\npercent conversion of the initial substrate (Figure 6C, F, I). All\nreactions used crystalline powder, substrate loadings of 2.9\u2013\n23.2 % by mass (29\u2013232 g L\n\u0000 1\n), and enzyme loadings of 0.5\u2013\n3 mg enzyme per g PET.\nFor optimization of total product release per unit of time,\nevaluation of the reactions at 24 h shows that increasing the\nsubstrate loading and the enzyme loading yields the highest\nconcentrations of product release per hour (Figure 6A, D, G).\nPerformance was also evaluated at 10 and 48 h to evaluate\ndifferent reaction times (Figures S7\u2013S9). For all three reaction\ndurations analyzed (10\u201348 h), the DM at 40 \u00b0 C showed the\nhighest overall product release rate (Figure 6G, Figures S7 and\nS8).\nFor optimization of product release rate per unit of enzyme\nin the reaction, after 24 h reaction time, two trends are\nobserved. Reactions at 40 \u00b0 C are optimized at high enzyme\nloadings and low substrate loadings (Figure 6E, H). In contrast,\nFigure 6.

Comparative performance evaluation at 24 h for the WT enzyme at\n30 and 40 \u00b0 C and the DM enzyme at 40 \u00b0 C using crystalline PET powder substrate.

Various enzyme and substrate loadings were tested for\nperformance optimization. For substrate loadings, from least to most: 2.9 % (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n), 5.8 % (58 g L\n\u0000 1\n), 11.6 % (116 g L\n\u0000 1\n), and 23.2 % (232 g L\n\u0000 1\n); for enzyme\nloadings, from least to most: 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mg g\n\u0000 1\n.

To decouple the influence of increased\nsolvent accessible surface area from the influence of substrate\ncrystallinity in these observations, we examined product release\nusing PET films with the same surface area and varying\ncrystallinity. Conversion extent after 96 h was measured using\nan amorphous film (2.0 \ufffd 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented\nfilm (30.7 \ufffd 5.5 % crystallinity), and annealed films with crystal-\nlinities ranging from 3.0 \ufffd 1.7 to 25.1 \ufffd 1.8 % (Figure 7, Fig-\nure S10A, Table S9). In general, conversion extent after 96 h\nincreased as crystallinity increased until the percent crystallinity\ncrossed a threshold around 20 % (Figure 7). Samples with 16.4 \ufffd\n1.2 % crystallinity show the highest product release, while a\nhighly crystalline annealed film (25.1 \ufffd 1.8 %) and the biaxially\noriented film (30.7 \ufffd 5.5 %) demonstrate low conversion extents\n(Figure 7).\nWT and DM enzymes display different sensitivities to\naccumulation of depolymerization products\nHigh extents of conversion will result in the accumulation of\nhigh concentrations of product monomer. To understand how\nmonomer accumulation influences IsPETase, we first investi-\ngated the influence of monomer accumulation on BHET\nhydrolysis over a timescale that affords complete or near-\ncomplete substrate conversion. Using an initial substrate\nconcentration of 2.25 mm BHET and 50 nm of the WT or DM,\nconversion was monitored over 18 h at 30 \u00b0 C (Figure 8). For the\nWT, 12.0 \ufffd 1.1 % of the initial substrate concentration remains\nafter 18 h (Figure 8A), while for the DM only 1.4 \ufffd 0.2 % remains\n(Figure 8D). To test the hypothesis that the WT is more\nsusceptible to slowed hydrolysis due to accumulation of MHET,\nwe next tested the same reaction scenario with both IsPETase\nand IsMHETase (50 nm each). With both enzymes present, the\nWT retains only 4.34 \ufffd 0.4 % of the initial substrate (Figure 8B),\nwhile the DM in the presence of MHETase retains 27.9 \ufffd 0.5 % of\nthe initial substrate (Figure 8E), suggesting the DM is more\nsusceptible to a slowed rate of hydrolysis with accumulated\nTPA.\nTo distinguish whether the effect of slowed hydrolysis was\ninfluenced by accumulating monomer or the presence of the\nsecond enzyme, we also evaluated how BHET hydrolysis was\ninfluenced by an initial concentration of monomer (1.25 mm\nMHET, TPA, or EG) in addition to the initial substrate concen-\ntration of 2.25 mm BHET. Over 18 h for the WT, BHET hydrolysis\nis slowed in the presence of excess MHET and EG, relative to\nthe reaction containing only BHET. BHET hydrolysis is slightly\nimproved in the presence of excess TPA (Figure 8C). For the\nDM, however, all three product monomers (MHET, TPA, and EG)\nslow the rate of BHET hydrolysis over 18 h (Figure 8F).\nWe subsequently investigated if accumulation of product\nmonomers exhibits a similar effect on conversion of amorphous\nPET film over 96 h, again by initiating reactions in the presence\nof product (1.25 mm BHET, MHET, TPA, or EG) along with the\nPET film (2.9 % by mass or 29 g L\n\u0000 1\n). Reactions containing\n1 mg g\n\u0000 1\nenzyme loading were evaluated for product release,\naccounting for the initial concentration of product monomer\n(Figure 9). For the WT incubated at 30 \u00b0 C, product release is\nincreased in the presence of TPA, and slowed by the\naccumulation of MHET and EG over time, relative to reactions\ncontaining only PET film (Figure 9A). For the DM, simulated\naccumulation of MHET had little effect on product release at 30\nor 40 \u00b0 C (Figure 9B, C). Simulated accumulation of TPA and EG\nshow reduced product release at 30 and 40 \u00b0 C (Figure 9B, C). To\nensure the enzyme is not destabilized in the presence of EG or\nTPA, we also measured the thermal stability of both the WT and\nDM under increasing concentrations of each product.

Accordingly, the\nmajor focus of enzymatic PET hydrolysis studies to date has\nbeen identification and engineering of new enzymes to this\nend. To address real waste streams at scale using an enzymatic\nrecycling technology, additional process factors will be critical.\nTechno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of such a\nprocess indicates that substrate loading, extent of depolymeri-\nzation, reaction residence time, enzyme loading, and enzyme\ncost are all within the top 10 process considerations impacting\nthe cost.\n[9b]\nTolerance to product inhibition, specificity for the\narray of possible substrate morphologies (including high\ncrystallinity substrates), and stability over the reaction residence\ntime are also important considerations for minimizing process\ncost, and represent important challenges and opportunities for\nadditional prospecting, characterization, and engineering of\nPET-hydrolyzing enzymes.\nIn this study, we compare the WT and a DM variant of the\nPET-hydrolyzing enzyme from I. sakaiensis across multiple\nfactors that drive process costs, highlighting the effects these\nreaction variables can have on performance. For example, while\nthe WT enzyme demonstrates high specificity for PET films\nunder ambient conditions, there are limitations in enzyme\nstability (Figure 3). Techno-economic analysis of a modeled\nenzymatic PET recycling process shows that varying temper-\nature (40\u201380 \u00b0 C) imparts no change to process costs. In contrast,\nreaction residence time and enzyme price, both of which would\nbe influenced by an unstable enzyme, contribute substantially\nto minimum selling price of the product.\n[9b]\nNot only will structural and biophysical properties of the\nbiocatalyst determine catalytic performance, but structural and\nphysical properties of the substrate are also critical variables to\nconsider.\n[13b,16e]\nWe observe a range of catalytic activity depend-\ning on the characteristics of the substrate, as demonstrated\nusing the annealed PET films of varying crystallinity (Figure 7,\nFigure S10). Both the WT and DM demonstrate a clear\npreference for more crystalline substrates, a trait that has not\nbeen reported for other PET-active enzymes. In the case of\nFigure 8. Accumulation of monomers influences extent of BHET hydrolysis at 30 \u00b0 C. BHET hydrolysis was evaluated at 30 \u00b0 C over 18 h reaction time using\n50 nm of WT or DM PETase, or 50 nm WT or DM PETase and 50 nm MHETase. All reactions used a starting concentration of 2.25 mm BHET in reaction buffer.\n(A) BHET hydrolysis by the WT yields primarily MHET. Conversion of the initial 2.25 mm BHET supplied in the reaction is incomplete over 18 h reaction time.\n(B) Combining PETase WT and MHETase in the reaction increases extent of BHET conversion over 18 h. (C) Product accumulation for each of the constituent\nmonomers is simulated by addition of 1.25 mm starting concentration to the initial BHET substrate. Bar graph shows % of initial BHET concentration remaining\nover 18 h reaction. In the presence of excess MHET (green) and EG (purple), the WT shows slower hydrolysis of BHET compared to the reactions containing\nBHET only. In the presence of excess TPA (blue), BHET hydrolysis is faster than reactions containing BHET only. (D) BHET hydrolysis by the DM yields primarily\nMHET. Conversion of the initial 2.25 mm BHET is nearly complete by 18 h. (E) Combining DM and MHETase in the reaction mixture yields primarily TPA.\nAccumulation of TPA appears to slow the conversion of BHET over the 18 h reaction observed.

In particular, it would be interesting to identify if\nPETase has a higher specificity for crystalline PET compared to\nother PET hydrolases, because while some enzymes have\ndemonstrated remarkable hydrolytic activity on amorphized\nPET,\n[1e]\nfar better than any activities reported for PETase or its\nvariants, efficient degradation of highly crystalline substrates\nremains a key opportunity in the development of robust and\ncost-effective enzymatic depolymerization systems.\n[9b]\nTo further explain the differences observed between the WT\nand DM, it seems unlikely that the increased thermal stability of\nthe DM is the primary driver of improved performance, as the\nDM enzyme at 30 \u00b0 C shows the poorest performance, despite\nimproved stability. It seems equally unlikely that a possible\nincrease in PET polymer flexibility at 40 \u00b0 C is the primary driver\nof improved performance, as the WT at 30 \u00b0 C demonstrates\nnearly as good performance as the DM at 40 \u00b0 C, still well below\nthe PET T\ng\n. The steady-state kinetic parameters derived from\nthe convMM and invMM models suggest there is an important\ntemperature-dependent change in affinity between the enzyme\nand the substrate at 40 \u00b0 C, perhaps indicating that association\nbetween the enzyme and the substrate is better at 40 \u00b0 C, but\nthis is true for both enzymes. A temperature-dependent\nimprovement in association between the polyester chain and\nthe enzyme could explain this phenomenon, but whether that\nis due to increased flexibility of the polyester, or a conforma-\ntional change of the enzyme is yet unknown.\nStudy of enzymes with specificity to PET has led to\nimportant discoveries about the catalytic mechanisms\n[4]\nand\nstructural properties of the enzymes. Extending these discov-\neries to facilitate comparative biochemistry requires a balance\nof functional assessment and elucidation of meaningful kinetic\nparameters.\n[14]\nFunctional assessment is critical for process\ndevelopment, uncovering relationships between time-depend-\nence, dose-dependence, and conversion extent. Structure-\nfunction relationships, however, are traditionally studied\nthrough the comparison of kinetic parameters based on initial\nreaction rates. For either methodology of comparison, without\nconsistent reaction conditions, direct comparisons between\nstudies are challenging. In this study, we consider both\napproaches for comparing the WT and DM.\nThe typical model employed for derivation of kinetic\nparameters is based on the conventional MM theory. For\ninterfacial biocatalysts, however, the applicability of this con-\nventional model to reactions taking place at the interface of a\nsolid substrate and aqueous media remains controversial,\n[14]\nspecifically regarding the assumption that substrate be avail-\nable in great excess relative to the enzyme concentration. To\naddress the limited applicability of the conventional MM model\nfor interfacial reactions, an alternative model has been\nproposed that instead looks at reaction regimes with a large\nexcess of available enzyme, coined an \u201cinverse\u201d MM model.\n[14,15]\nThis model has previously been applied to PET-hydrolyzing\nenzymes.\n[15]\nIn contrast to our observations, the previous interfacial\nkinetics study of the PETase DM showed that initial reaction\nrates declined in response to increased enzyme loading in the\ninvMM reaction regime.\n[15]\nA hypothesis was proposed to\nsuggest that \u201covercrowding\u201d of active and/or denatured\nenzyme at the surface of the substrate, in combination with a\nreduction in the number of available reactive sites due to fast\nturnover of the substrate would lead to this inhibition\nbehavior.\n[15]\nIf limitation in surface accessibility were the primary\ncause, this inhibition behavior would be expected to occur\nmore markedly on substrates with less surface area accessible,\nsuch as films, but that behavior is not apparent in the studies\npresented here.\nWith regard to satisfying the requirements of the conven-\ntional MM model, we selected an enzyme loading consistent\nwith other experiments from this study, which also corresponds\nto the midpoint of the enzyme loadings using for the invMM\nexperiment. This enzyme loading may have been too high to\nsatisfy the requirements of the convMM model. From a\n\u201cconcentration\u201d perspective, PET monomers comprising the\nFigure 9. Accumulation of product monomers influences hydrolysis rates of\namorphous PET film. Product accumulation was simulated through the\naddition of 1.25 mm monomer to the reaction mixture along with\namorphous PET film substrate. Aromatic product accumulation over 96 h is\ncompared to reactions containing only the amorphous PET film (gray).\nMonomer accumulation simulation was performed at (A) 30 \u00b0 C with the WT,\n(B) 30 \u00b0 C with the DM, and (C) 40 \u00b0 C with the DM using 1 mg g\n\u0000 1\nenzyme\nloading and 2.9 % by mass (29 g L\n\u0000 1\n) loading of the film for all reactions.\nReaction progress is represented by the sum of aromatic products, BHET,\nMHET, and TPA, accounting for the starting concentration of product\nmonomer.

The implications of this\nare that if the enzyme concentration is too high for the\nconvMM dataset, at all solids loadings we observe here, the\nsubstrate is saturated with enzyme, and the requirement that\nsubstrate be in great excess is not met. For reference, the\nprevious study\n[15]\nto look at initial reaction rates for PET\nhydrolysis used 30 nm enzyme loading (relative to 950 nm used\nin this study), but solids loadings up to only 0.6 % (relative to\n11.6 % in this study). While this study uses approximately\n30 times the enzyme concentration of the previous study, it\nalso explores solids loadings of approximately 20 times higher\nas well. Despite the differences in experimental design, we\nobserve a similar k\ncat\nfrom the conventional model (0.52 s\n\u0000 1\nreported by B\u00e5\u00e5th et al.\n[15]\ncompared to 1.2 s\n\u0000 1\nreported here)\nand a similar\ninv\nV\nmax\n/S\n0\nfrom the inverse model (2.6 nmol s\n\u0000 1\ng\n\u0000 1\nfrom B\u00e5\u00e5th et al.\n[15]\ncompared to 2.2 nmol s\n\u0000 1\ng\n\u0000 1\nreported here)\nwhen using the same enzyme, same substrate, and same\ntemperature.\nThe kinetic parameters derived from these studies should\nallow one to compare performance of various enzymes,\nespecially with regard to establishing structure-function rela-\ntionships. The potential for performance based on the first\nmoments or hours of a reaction, however, is not always\nreflective of functional performance. Based on the kinetic\nparameters derived from these studies, we would conclude that\nWT-40 \u00b0 C is the superior enzyme/temperature combination,\nhowever the WT is less stable at 40 \u00b0 C and the lifetime of this\nperformance is limited relative to using the same enzyme at a\nlower temperature. Similarly, employing the DM at 40 \u00b0 C, where\nit can maintain stability for longer, also allows for more PET\nconversion using the same amount of enzyme.\nFor any enzymatic process, but certainly for enzymatic\nreactions performed at an industrial scale, loss of catalytic\nperformance due to inhibition can have a significant impact on\nprocess costs. Both the WT and DM enzymes show slowed rates\nof hydrolysis upon accumulation of product monomers. Each\nenzyme has a different inhibition sensitivity profile, which is\nsomewhat unexpected. While we see potentially significant\nimpacts of product inhibition at the small scale, we do not\nknow if the influence is still significant at large scale. It is also an\nopen question if the product accumulation profile and inhib-\nition sensitivity profile might change in a pH-controlled reaction\nrelative to the small-volume closed-system reactions we have\npresented here.\n[16b]"
