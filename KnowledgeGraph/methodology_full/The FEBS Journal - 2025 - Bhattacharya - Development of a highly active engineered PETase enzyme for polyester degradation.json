[15],a\nmutant of the wild-type leaf-branch compost cutinase\n(LCC) bearing four point substitutions: F243I,\nY127G, S283C, and D238C. The latter two substitu-\ntions introduce a second disul\ufb01de bond, complement-\ning the native C275\u2013C292 bond. In both wild-type and\nmutant enzymes, the catalytic site is centered on resi-\ndue S165. The crystal structure of the inactive S165A\nLCC-ICCG variant is available in the Protein Data\nBank (PDB ID: 6THS). Our design strategy followed\nestablished protocols [17\u201319] beginning with the rever-\nsion of residue 165 to the catalytically active serine.\nResidues within 5\u02daA of S165 were excluded from muta-\ngenesis to preserve active site integrity. Three distinct\ncomputational methods were employed, yielding three\nseparate series of variants.\nThe use of the Rosetta Supercharge method [22]\nwhich aimed at increasing the charge on the surface of\nthe enzyme, led to the identi\ufb01cation of 1 000 potential\nenzyme variants, from which those 10 that featured\nthe best Rosetta score (which we named C01-C10)\nwere selected for further analysis. PROSS design[21]\nproduced 9 variants (P01-P09), and Disul\ufb01de-by-\nDesign [23] identi\ufb01ed 125 enzyme variants, from which\nwe selected the best 10, named X01-X10.\nThe 29 candidate enzyme variants originating from\nthe different computational screening methods were\nthen subject to 1 \u03bcs molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations in explicit water and ranked based on their\nstability as assessed by RMSF analysis [17]. Our\nMD-based ranking led to the selection of six candidate\nmutants (C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09) for experi-\nmental production and characterization (Fig. 1,\nFig. S1 and Table2).\nThermal stability\nThe six candidate enzymes were expressed in E. coli\nand puri\ufb01ed. The \ufb01nal yields of all the enzymes were\naround 16 mg/C1 L\n/C0 1 of bacterial culture (see yield in\nTable S1). Wild-type LCC, a naturally occurring\nPETase, has a Tm of 84.7 \u00b0C. This enzyme has been\npreviously engineered by Tournieret al. [15] leading to\nthe LCC-ICCG variant with a reportedTm of 94.0\u00b0C\n(93.6 \u00b0C in our own assessment, a difference that could\nbe attributed to that fact that, forTm measurements,\nTournier et al. used differential scanning \ufb02uorimetry\n(DSF), whereas we used circular dichroism (CD)).\nIndeed, during the thermal stability assessment of the\nenzymes, it became apparent that the determination of\nits melting temperature (T\nm) via differential scanning\n\ufb02uorimetry (DSF) was unreliable. Speci\ufb01cally, the\ndenaturation curve could not be accurately derived\ndue to theT\nm approaching 100\u00b0C, which is the upper\noperational limit of the Applied Biosystems 7500\nReal-Time PCR System utilized for the DSF measure-\nments. As a result, a complete unfolding transition\n(typically indicated by a plateau) could not be\nobserved for the enzymes within the instrumental con-\nstraints. To overcome this limitation and enable a con-\nsistent comparison across all enzyme variants, we\nemployed CD spectroscopy. This technique facilitated\nthe accurate determination of T\nm values for all pro-\nteins examined in the study. Consequently, we propose\nthat the discrepancy in the T\nm of ICCG reported by\nTournier et al. compared to our \ufb01ndings likely arises\nfrom the methodological differences between DSF and\nCD-based measurements.\nAfter our enzyme design campaign, we tested the\nthermal stability of the six engineered variants\n(Table 3); we found that the C09 (T\nm = 97.1 \u00b0C) and\nX05 (Tm = 96.9 \u00b0C) variants have a higherTm than the\nreference LCC-ICCG ( Tm = 93.6 \u00b0C).

Given the potential absorption\nspectra overlaps of the degradation products that will\naffect the absorption spectra recording in spectropho-\ntometric methods, we chose HPLC for its higher speci-\n\ufb01city and precision in quantifying the enzymatic\nreaction products as also described in the literature\n[24]. To assess enzymatic activity, aliquots of the enzy-\nmatic reactions were harvested at multiple time points\nand analyzed by HPLC for the quanti\ufb01cation of TPA\nproduction (Fig. 2A). Minor degradation products\n(MHET and BHET) were also assessed (Fig.S3).

If\nwe exclude the \ufb01rst few hours, where ICCG performs\nbetter, at 68 \u00b0C the mean TPA concentration at the\ndifferent time points is signi\ufb01cantly higher for the C09\nmutant than for ICCG up until day 6 (144 h, Fig.2A,\nB and Figs S3\u2013S5). Moreover, the speci\ufb01c activity of\nC09 is also signi\ufb01cantly higher ( \u22482-fold) than that\nof the gold standard LCC-ICCG over the same length\nof time (Fig. 2C). All other enzymes show similar or\nweaker performances compared to LCC-ICCG (X09,\nC08, X05). At 68 \u00b0C, complete sample degradation\ncould be observed with C09 already at day 4 (data not\nshown), a feature not seen with any of the other\nenzymes, including LCC-ICCG. The percentage of\nweight loss after 6 days of reactions for all the enzymes\nis shown in Fig. 2D and in Fig. S3D. In order to\nassess the general functionality of the different PETase\nvariants, we also tested the esterase activity for the\nPETase variants using p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA)\nas a substrate. The speci\ufb01c activity against pNPA is\nhighest for C09 and C08, followed by ICCG and X09.\nThe mutants X05, P06, and P08 have the lowest spe-\nci\ufb01c activity (Fig.S6).\nEnzyme structure\nWe determined the crystal structure of C09 to assess\nwhether the substitutions lead to changes in the struc-\nture of the enzyme. The structure was determined at\n1.28 \u02daA resolution. We compared the predicted second-\nary structure content based on CD with the experi-\nmental results, showing good alignment between the\nCD-based prediction and the crystallographic structure\n(Table S2). The structural comparison of the C09 vari-\nant with the parent enzymes shows no signi\ufb01cant\nchanges in the folding, as observed by the minimal\nchange in RMSD with respect to the WT (0.257 \u02daA)\nand to the LCC-ICCG variant (0.152\u02daA). The position\nand orientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242,\nand S265) overlap perfectly with the catalytic triad in\nthe parent enzymes (Fig. 3A). Although we observe\nthat increased stability leads to higher enzymatic activ-\nity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is\nelusive. We hypothesize that the increase in stability\nprovided by the additional surface charges in the C09\nvariant may help to keep the surface-exposed catalytic\nsite in place even at high temperatures, such as those\nused to test the activity of the enzyme (68\u00b0C). Indeed,\nall the substitutions introduced in the design process\nare found mostly on the surface of the enzyme and\naway from the catalytic triad (Fig. 3B; Fig. S7)\nand are thus unlikely to affect the activity directly.\nRather, the substitutions may reduce the proportion of\nthe enzyme that may denature over time, and/or pre-\nvent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The\ndenaturation (and the consequent loss of activity) is\nTable 2.List of substitutions relative to the sequence of the wild-\ntype LCC enzyme.

      "text": "mutants\nWe started our enzyme engineering process from the\nLCC-ICCG enzyme reported by Tournieret al. [15]. This\nengineered enzyme is a mutant of the wild-type leaf-branch\ncompost cutinase (LCC) carrying 4 point mutations: F243I,\nY127G, S283C, and D238C. The last two substitutions are\ndesigned to induce the formation of a second disul\ufb01de\nbond, in addition to the native one (C275-C292). In both\nenzymes, the catalytic site is centered on residue S165. The\nstructure of the LCC-ICCG engineered enzyme is available\nin the Protein Data Bank (PDB code:6THS) as the inacti-\nvated S165A variant.\nIn our design strategy, we applied protocols used in pre-\nvious works [17\u201319] starting from the LCC-ICCG mutant\nstructure after reverting amino acid 165 from Alanine to\nthe catalytically active Serine. All residues within a distance\nof 5 \u02daA from S165 were excluded from the design and were\ntherefore left unchanged. The design was done using three\nseparate methods, resulting in three different series of\nvariants.\nThe \ufb01rst design strategy (C-series) was performed using\nthe Rosetta Supercharge tool[22]. This tool was employed\nto reengineer the protein surface with amino acids that pre-\nsent a high net charge, which is reported to prevent aggre-\ngation of partially unfolded states. The design produced\n1024 enzyme variants, and the best 10 based on the internal\nscore were kept for further ranking. The Rosetta Super-\ncharge tool directly provides a 3D model in PDB format\nfor the proposed mutants.\nIn the second design strategy (P-series) we used the\nPROSS web server [21] to generate 9 different enzyme\ndesigns with improved packing, hydrogen bond networks,\nand salt bridge networks. PROSS directly provided the\nPDB structure of the proposed variants.\nThe third design strategy (X-series) employed the\nDisul\ufb01de-by-Design web server [23] a tool for disul\ufb01de\nbond prediction that allows \ufb01nding pairs of amino acids\nthat can carry cysteine substitutions in the correct orienta-\ntion to form disul\ufb01des. A total of 150 pair substitutions\nwere generated and, based on the internal scoring system,\nthe best 10 of them were retained for further testing. In this\ncase, we used the \u201cMutate Residue\u201d tool in VMD to mod-\nify the proposed positions to cysteines.\nOverall, our design campaign produced 29 different\nenzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD simu-\nlations; then ranked according to the method described in\nprevious works [17\u201320] Brie\ufb02y, we solvated each molecular\nmodel with a 15\u02daA pad of TIP3P water, and we introduced\ncounter ions to neutralize the system charge, resulting in a\n\ufb01nal simulation box of \u224830.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass\nrepartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs[35].\nThe systems were subjected to 1000 energy minimization\nsteps, and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and\nat a temperature of 300 K with NAMD software[36] using\nAMBER19SB force \ufb01eld [37] non-bonded cutoff of 12 \u02daA,\nrigid bonds, and particle-mesh Ewald long-range electro-\nstatics. During the equilibration simulation, the C\u03b1 atoms\nof the protein were restrained by a 10 kcal /C1 mol\n/C0 1/C1 \u02daA/C0 2\nspring constant. The 1\u03bcs production runs were performed\nusing a NVT ensemble whereby all the parameters (non-\nbonded cutoff, and PME) were the same as in the equili-\nbration phase. All simulations were run in triplicates. Root\nmean square deviations (RMSD) were monitored after each\nMD run to assess structural convergence, while root mean\nsquare \ufb02uctuations (RMSF) were calculated to assess the\nimproved stability of the design. As a result, the two best\nstructures from each design series were selected, namely\ndesign LCC-ICCG-C08, LCC-ICCG-C09, LCC-ICCG-P06,\nLCC-ICCG-P08, LCC-ICCG-X05, LCC-ICCG-X09. In the\nremainder of this document, the \u201cLCC-IGGC-\u201d pre\ufb01x of\nenzyme names is omitted for brevity.\nProtein expression and puri\ufb01cation\nThe different codon-optimized nucleotide sequences of the\ndesigned PETase mutants were cloned in a pET26b(+) bacte-\nrial expression vector (Novagen, Malvern, Worcestershire,\nUK), together with a C-terminal 6His-tag. All the different\nmutants were transformed and expressed inEscherichia coli\nBL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Then,\nthe bound His-tagged enzyme was eluted with the same\nbuffer supplemented with 500 m\nM imidazole in a linear gradi-\nent. The protein eluted completely with 250 mM imidazole.\nThe eluted fraction was loaded onto a PD-10 desalting col-\numn pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 m\nM Tris/HCl pH 8.0,\n300 mM NaCl) for buffer exchange. Buffer exchange was per-\nformed simultaneously after the protein was puri\ufb01ed.

Protein concentration was\nassessed using a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c,\nWaltham, MA, USA). Sample purity was evaluated by 12%\nSDS/PAGE. The \ufb01nal yields of all the enzymes were around\n16 mg/C1 L\n/C0 1 of bacterial culture.\nCircular dichroism\nCircular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on\na Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at 20\u00b0C. CD was per-\nformed to detect the secondary structure of different vari-\nants and to measure the thermostability of the enzyme. The\nspectra were determined with the following parameters:\ncontinuous scanning mode with a scanning speed of\n50 nm/C1 min\n/C0 1, band width 0.1 nm, data pitch 0.1 nm at\n20 \u00b0C. A 1.0 mm path length quartz cuvette was used for\n5 \u03bcM samples of different enzymes in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH\n8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Thermal denaturation curves were mea-\nsured in 1.0 mm path length cuvettes closed with a para\ufb01lm\non protein solutions. Protein denaturation was induced\nupon increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 \u00b0C/C1 min\n/C0 1\nfrom 20 \u00b0C to 120 \u00b0C. The ellipticity at 222 nm was\nrecorded at intervals of 0.2\u00b0C using a 1-nm bandwidth and\na response of 10 s.\nThe determination of the midpoints of the thermal dena-\nturation curves (Tm) was done by \ufb01tting the data to a sigmoi-\ndal transition curve using a modi\ufb01ed sigmoidal model[38]:\nCD = b /C1 T/C0 c\u00f0\u00de /C0 d /C1 T/C0 e\u00f0\u00de\n1 \u00fe T\na\n/C0/C1f/C16/C17\n\u00fe d /C1 T/C0 e\u00f0\u00de\n(1)\nwhere T is the temperature, a represents the melting tem-\nperature ( Tm), and the terms ( b/C1 T /C0 c) and ( d/C1 T /C0 e)\naccount for baseline drift at low and high temperatures,\nrespectively. The parameter f controls the steepness of the\ntransition. This model allows for accurate \ufb01tting of CD\n(circular dichroism) data across the full thermal range, cap-\nturing both transition and baseline behavior (Fig.S2).\nThe secondary structures of all the different variants\nwere measured at 200\u2013250 nm wavelengths and 20\u00b0C. Ellip-\nticity was plotted versus wavelength with GraphPad Prism\n10 software. Each recorded spectrum was the average of\nthree scans (Figs S8, S9). CD spectra for the C09 variant\nwere further analyzed using the K2D algorithm of the\nDichroWeb tool[39] (Table S2).\nEnzymatic reaction\nBis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)\nterephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene\nglycol (EG) are the major depolymerization products of the\nactivity of the enzymes on PET. These compounds can be\nseparated ef\ufb01ciently on a C18 reversed-phase high-\nperformance liquid chromatography HPLC column, thus\nallowing a precise quanti\ufb01cation of product formation. All\nenzyme reactions were performed at a concentration of\n40 n\nM at 68\u00b0C in quintuplicates in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge\ntubes in the reaction buffer (500 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0,\n300 mM NaCl). Amorphous, 250\u03bcm-thick PET \ufb01lms (prod-\nuct number ES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow\nUSA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a hole\npuncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4 mg,\nwere then placed in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The esterase\nactivity of enzyme variants was assessed by monitoring the\nhydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA)[24]. Reactions\nwere performed at a concentration of 0.1\u20131.0 \u03bc\nM in a 96-well\nmicroplate at 25\u00b0C using 1 mM pNPA in a buffer containing\n20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. Enzymatic\nactivity was quanti\ufb01ed by measuring the increase in absor-\nbance at 405 nm (Clariostar Plus), corresponding to the for-\nmation of p-nitrophenolate ( \u03b5\u2084\u2080\u2085 = 11.6 m\nM/C0 1/C1 cm/C0 1) (see\nFig. S6).\nReversed-phase liquid chromatography\nThe different compounds produced by PET hydrolytic\nenzymes (TPA, as well as BHET and MHET) were quanti-\n\ufb01ed by reversed-phase HPLC (TablesS3\u2013S5). HPLC ana-\nlyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus\nsystem equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven, and\nan autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations\nwere carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 \u03bcm;\n4.6 \u00d7 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column\ntemperature was maintained at 40\u00b0C with a \ufb02ow rate of\n1m L/C1 min\n/C0 1. For the mobile phase, 0.1% H3PO4 (solvent\nA) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The linear gradient\nmode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B;\n0\u201315 min, 10\u201340% B; 15 \u201318 min, 40\u201365% B; 18 \u201320 min,\n9\u00aa 2025 The Author(s).

      "text": "Despite IsPETase being initially considered a promis-\ning enzyme for PET degradation, multiple studies have\nshown that thermophilic PET hydrolases (e.g., LCC),\nwhen operating at temperatures above 65\u00b0C, outper-\nform mesophilic enzymes in PET biorecycling [30].\nSince its publication in 2020, the LCC-ICCG variant\nhas been considered the state-of-the-art PETase\nenzyme. Hence, starting from this variant, we set out\nto engineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal sta-\nbility and enzymatic activity. The resulting LCC-\nICCG-C09 design featured a signi\ufb01cant improvement\nin terms of thermal stability ( T\nm = 97.1 \u00b0C) with\nrespect to the gold standard LCC-ICCG ( +3.5 \u00b0C).\nUnder optimal reaction conditions (68\u00b0C) and at labo-\nratory scale, the LCC-ICCG-C09 enzyme hydrolyzed\nlow-crystallinity PET materials into TPA with a 2-fold\nhigher ef\ufb01ciency compared to LCC-ICCG. The LCC-\nICCG-C09 variant may represent a further step\ntowards PET biorecycling. However, further work will\nbe needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant\nconditions. The LCC-ICCG-C09 variant could also\nprovide the basis for further rounds of enzyme\nengineering.\nRecent studies reported in the literature adopted\nsimilar approaches to ours, introducing substitutions\nto the LCC-ICCG enzyme to boost its performance\nand reporting different degrees of success[26,28,31,32]\nHowever, as reported in relevant reviews[33,34] direct\nFig. 2.Comparison of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) depolymerization over time for all enzymes.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nAlthough the \ufb01eld of PETase engineering is very\ndynamic and is providing highly optimized enzymes,\nseveral issues still need to be thoroughly investigated\nto improve enzymatic PET degradation [34]. One of\nthe major challenges is related to the economic viabil-\nity of enzymatic degradation. Another challenge, more\ndirectly related to protein engineering, concerns the\nacidi\ufb01cation of the medium due to the release of TPA,\nwhich reduces the performance of the PETase enzymes\nknown to date. Hence, possible directions for enzyme\nengineering research could be directed towards the\ndesign of acid-tolerant PETase enzymes. Finally, while\nour study primarily compares newly developed\nenzymes with the current gold standard in a laboratory\nsetting, we recognize the need for industrial-scale vali-\ndation, such as testing with post-consumer PET in\nbioreactors."
