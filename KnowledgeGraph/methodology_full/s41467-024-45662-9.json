A major breakthrough in the biodegradation of\npoly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is achieved by using a LCC variant, which\npermits 90% conversion at an industrial level. Despite the achievements, its\napplications have been hampered by the remaining 10% of nonbiodegradable\nPET. Herein, we address current challenges by employing a computational\nstrategy to engineer a hydrolase from the bacterium HR29. The redesigned\nvariant, TurboPETase, outperforms other well-known PET hydrolases. Nearly\ncomplete depolymerization is accomplished in 8 h at a solids loading of\n200 g kg\n\u22121. Kinetic and structural analysis suggest that the improved perfor-\nmance may be attributed to a more\ufb02exible PET-binding groove that facilitates\nthe targeting of more speci\ufb01c attack sites. Collectively, our results constitute a\nsigni\ufb01cant advance in understanding and engineering of industrially applic-\nable polyester hydrolases, and provideguidance for further efforts on other\npolymer types.\nSubstantial efforts have been dedicated to discovering and engineer-\ning PET hydrolases over the past two decades, contributing to the\ndevelopment of PET biodegradation from the detection of trace\namounts of released products to the attainment of high conversion\n1\u2013 12.\nWhen combating the challenges posed by enzymatic PET recycling,\nkey parameters should be taken into consideration to attain an eco-\nnomically viable industrial process, in particular solids loading\n(> 150 g kg\n\u22121) and product yield (> 90%)13\u2013 15. However, almost all studies\nobtain appreciable depolymerization yields at solids loadings lower\nthan 30 g kg\n\u22121, which is considerably below an industrially relevant\nlevel15. When increasing the solids loading to a high level, a reduction in\nthe hydrolysis rate and conversion is commonly observed (referred to\nas \u201csolids effect\u201d), as demonstrated in other heterogeneous reactions\nsuch as the biomass conversion process\n16.\nA breakthrough was achieved with an engineered LCC variant\n(LCCICCG) that exhibited 90% depolymerization of pretreated PET waste\nat an industrially relevant solids loading (200 g kg\u22121)17.H o w e v e r ,t h e\n10% nonbiodegradable PET remained and reached a high crystallinity\nlevel of ~30% because of physical aging, hindering immediate reuse for\nPET depolymerization. A report issued by the National Association for\nPET Container Resources indicated that the postconsumer PET bottles\ncollected for recycling reached 800 kilotons in the US\n11, and this would\ngenerate over 80 kilotons of nonbiodegradable PET waste per year if\nthe current biodegradation strategy was employed, posing a sig-\nni\ufb01cant threat to the PET recycling economy. Increasing the extent of\nconversion from 90% to 99% would cut the minimum selling price\n(MSP) of TPA by 10% (US$0.2/kg) according to the TEA model pro-\nposed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US; thus,\nsecond to solids loading, the conversion level is the largest factor\naffecting MSP in the depolymerization process\n14.

The H218S/F222I,\nW104L, and F243T mutations are shown as orange atoms, whereas the catalytic\ntriad is shown as hot pink atoms.D Schematic diagram of PET depolymerization\nprocesses. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, TurboPETase may be more pro-\nmiscuous due to the increased\ufb02exibility along the protein PET-binding groove,\nwhich allows it to attack different surface structures.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45662-9\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:1417 5\nAn in-depth structural analysis also helps us to understand the\nmolecular underpinnings of the performance improvements. Accord-\ning to the model of TurboPETase predicted by AlphaFold247 and sub-\nsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the improved\nperformance of TurboPETase may be attributed to the following key\naspects: improved\ufb02exibility of the substrate binding cleft (H218S/\nF222I, W104L and F243T), optimized charge-charge interactions at the\nprotein surface (A209R and D238K), and introduction of a disul\ufb01de\nbond (A251C-A281C). A209R, D238K, and the disul\ufb01de bond A251C-\nA281C are suggested to primarily contribute to improving thermo-\nstability while maintaining activity (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11),\nwhereas the enhanced hydrolysis ef\ufb01cacy may be attributed to sub-\nstitutions in proximity to the active sites. H218 is suggested to form an\nintimate packing with the conserved W190 in analogous enzymes.\nChen et al. found that PET hydrolytic activity could bene\ufb01t from a more\n\ufb02exible active site in the H214S/F218I double mutant (corresponds to\nH218S/F222I in BhrPETase)\n35. In the present study, MD simulations of\nthe apo form of TurboPETase revealed an expanded rotational free-\ndom of W190 endowed by the H218S/F222I mutation (Supplementary\nFig. 12), which is consistent with the observation of diverse con-\nformations of the corresponding W156 ofIsPETase\n35.W h e nb i n d i n gt o\nthe PET, the wobbling of W190 is curtailed and anchored by the\u03c0-\u03c0\ninteractions with the PET substrate. This\ufb02exibility of the PET binding\ncleft was further enhanced by the synergistic interactions conferred by\nthe addition of W104L and F243T, as revealed by the C\u03b1 root-mean-\nsquare \ufb02uctuation (RMSF) results (Fig.3C). W104 is previously repor-\nted to pack against the adjacent P248 to stabilize the P248-situated\u03b28-\n\u03b16l o o p34. In the redesigned TurboPETase, the relinquishment of this\ninteraction by leucine substitution may engender increased con-\nformational malleability within the loop region (N246-A250), as\ndemonstrated by the largely reduced cross-correlation of these\nregions (Supplementary Fig. 13). For another substitution F243T in the\nPET binding cleft, the steric pro\ufb01le of F243 appears to dictate a more\nperipheral binding locus for PET. Yet, its mutation to threonine, armed\nwith a less pronounced steric feature, may release the space for PET\nbinding with a more-\ufb02exible state. More importantly, without the steric\npro\ufb01le of the aromatic ring, T243 may beckon PET deeper into the\ncleft, drawing the substrate\u2019s labile carbonyl closer to the catalytic\nserine, with the interstitial distances contracting from 4.88 \u00b1 0.51 \u00c5 to\n4.15 \u00b1 0.37 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 14). Concurrently, the enhanced\n\ufb02exibility might compromise the protein\u2019s stability, which is consistent\nwith the observed decrease in the melting temperatures of the single\npoint mutations. Synthesizing our structural analysis with the kinetic\ndata, we postulated that the greatly increased\ufb02exibility along the PET-\nbinding groove may provide more space to accommodate a variety of\nattack conformations through dynamic binding, which may be crucial\nfor the formation of catalytically competent complexes on different\nsurface structures (Fig.3D). Based on the above results, we reasoned\nthat TurboPETase is probably more promiscuous with respect to the\nconformation of the PET strand it attacks. Nevertheless, detailed\nanalysis of the mechanism requires further efforts through more in-\ndepth research.\nPerformance of TurboPETase on alternative substrates and in\ndual-enzyme systems\nPrevious study has demonstrated limited biodegradation ef\ufb01ciency of\nIsPETase and its variant towards other semiaromatic polyesters, spe-\nci\ufb01cally PBT, at 37 \u00b0C36. Compared to PET, PBT has a lower glass tran-\nsition temperature (Tg), which ranges between 37 and 55 \u00b0C48.I nt h i s\nstudy, even though 65 \u00b0C surpasses theTg of PBT, thus signi\ufb01cantly\nenhancing the mobility of PBT polymer chains, all of the examined\nenzymes exhibited substantially reduced degradation ef \ufb01ciency\ntowards PBT \ufb01lms at 65 \u00b0C with respect to the degradation of PET\n(Supplementary Fig. 15). Speci\ufb01cally, TurboPETase yielded higher\namounts of hydrolytic products (62.6\u03bcM) than both BhrPETase\n(27.5\u03bcM) and LCC\nICCG (47.1\u03bcM). These results suggested that the\nactive sites of current PET-degrading enzymes were less ef\ufb01cient in\nbinding with the extended aliphatic chains in PBT compared to PET.\nConsequently, dedicated efforts in enzyme discovery or tailored\nengineering are still needed for further improving the depolymeriza-\ntion of new classes of semiaromatic polyesters.\nVarious efforts have been made to develop dual enzyme systems\nto remove the intermediate products BHET and MHET\n49\u2013 53, which are\nknown inhibitors of PET hydrolases. Haugwitz et al. reported a dual\nenzyme system combining an engineered TfCa mutant and PETase PM\nenzyme that yielded a 4-fold increase in overall products towards Gf-\nPET \ufb01lms compared to PETase PM alone at 45 \u00b0C over 24 h\n52.W ef u r t h e r\nexplored the application potential of TurboPETase by coupling it with\nthe recently reported thermostable BHET hydrolyzing enzyme,\nBHETase\n54, in a dual-enzyme system. At a low substrate loading\n(2 g kg\u22121), the dual-enzyme system effectively doubled the overall yield\nof the products, relative to the singular use of TurboPETase (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 16). However, an intriguing observation emerged at an\nelevated PET loading of 30 g kg\n\u22121. TurboPETase alone surpassed the\nyields from most enzyme ratios in the dual-enzyme system at 65 \u00b0C, the\nonly exception being the 0.5 mg\nTurboPETase/gPET:0.1 mgBHETase/gPET\nratio. Nevertheless, in the current investigation, only degradation of\namorphous PET materials at 65 \u00b0C were evaluated. Future research\ncould expand to examine the ef\ufb01cacy of the dual-enzyme system on\ndifferent MHET hydrolases and PET substrates with varying physical\nproperties under diverse reaction conditions, including varied\ntemperatures.\nNearly complete degradation of postconsumer PET products at\nindustrially relevant high-solids loading\nTo better evaluate the depolymerization performance of TurboPETase\nat industrially relevant levels of solids loading, we have compared the\ndepolymerization of pretreated postconsumer coloured-\ufb02ake PET\n(PcPET) wastes with TurboPETase and LCC\nICCG at a substrate loading of\n200 g kg\u22121. TurboPETase achieved nearly complete depolymerization\n(98.2%, calculated from the HPLC data) of PcPET wastes in 8 h (Fig.4A),\nwith a maximum production rate of 61.3 ghydrolyzed PETL\u22121 h\u22121 (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). A slight change in\nthe crystallinity of PcPET was observed (reaching 11.9% after 8 h),\nwhich allows an immediate reuse of the remaining PcPET waste for\ndepolymerization. In contrast, LCC\nICCG required 16 h to reach 97.7%\ndepolymerization (calculated from the HPLC data) at 65 \u00b0C, and the\nremaining PcPET exhibited a similar crystallinity of 11.1%, demon-\nstrating that the\u201cphysical aging\u201d process was suppressed at lower\ntemperatures. At the previously reported optimal reaction tempera-\nture of 72 \u00b0C, LCC\nICCG reached its maximal conversion of 92.5% (cal-\nculated from the HPLC data) over 12 h, and no further increase was\nobtained after prolonged reaction time due to the higher deform-\nability of PET chains.

Among these, the role of low crystallinity in PET\ndegradation has been extensively studied. A crystallinity exceeding\n20% has been previously proposed to signi\ufb01cantly impede the enzy-\nmatic degradation process. In the depolymerization of non-melt-\nquenched PET powders (27.6% crystallinity), we found a signi\ufb01cant\nreduction in degradation performance (Supplementary Fig. 18 and\nSupplementary Table 11). However, during the depolymerization of\npretreated PcPET, even when the crystallinity reached 20% after 4 h of\ndegradation by LCC\nICCG at 72 \u00b0C, we did not observe a rapid decline in\ndegradation rate. Pfaff et al. showed that LCCICCG is more ef\ufb01cient in\nhydrolyzing shorter polymers27. Recent studies also demonstrated that\nheavily pretreated PET, with a degree of polymerization (DP) less than\n20 and high crystallinity, can remain highly degradable\n55,56.T h e s e\n\ufb01ndings underscored the importance of factors other than crystallinity\nin enzymatic degradation, and promoted further investigation\nthrough gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, which\nrevealed notably low weight-average (M\nw) and number-average (Mn)\nmolecular masses in PcPET powders compared to non-melt-quenched\nPET powders (Supplementary Table 12). From the GPC results, we\nspeculate that the low molecular weight of pretreated PcPET may\ncontribute to the maintained degradation rate by LCC\nICCG at 72 \u00b0C\nduring the\ufb01rst several reaction hours, but a further increase in crys-\ntallinity to 32.5% led to a substantial reduction in the amorphous\nregions, impeding further enzymatic catalysis. Moreover, during the\ndepolymerization process, we also observed a slight decrease inMw\nand moderate changes inMn, despite achieving over 90% depoly-\nmerization (Fig.4B ) .T h i si sc o n s i s t e n tw i t hp r e v i o u ss t u d i e so nP E T\ndegradation hydrolyzed by Cut19057. It has been suggested that the\nenzymatic hydrolysis of PET typically initiates with an endo-type chain\nscission after the enzyme binds to the PET surface. Further hydrolysis\nof the neighboring ester bonds within the amorphous regions occurs\nthrough an exo-type chain scission, leading to the release of soluble\nproducts\n19. For polymers undergoing random scission, the probability\nof exo-scission inversely correlates with chain length53.F o rP E Tw i t ha\nDP around 200, the probability for exo-scission is substantially less\nthan for endo-scission. In this study, the DP of the pretreated PcPET,\napproximately 50, is much lower than that of typical raw PET materials.\nThis resulted in a signi\ufb01cantly increased number of chain ends avail-\nable for exo-scissions. Consequently, endo-type scission, which would\nreduce the DP of PET, no longer held a dominant proportion, which\nmay potentially explain the minimal changes in molecular size\nobserved during the PET depolymerization process.\nTo explore the industrial viability, we scaled up the reaction\nand performed it in a 7.5 L bioreactor with a PET loading of 200 g kg\n\u22121\nin water solution at pH 8.0. Enzyme loading is of particular concern to\nthe industry since enzyme cost is among the essential factors in\nthe biomass depolymerization process.

Twenty grams of pretreated PET powder and 80 mL of\n100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 40 mg of\npuri\ufb01ed enzyme were mixed in a 200 mL bioreactor (Kusnc, Shanghai,\nChina). A magnetic stirrer was utilized to maintain constant agitation at\n300 rpm. The temperature was regulated at 65 \u00b0C (or 72 \u00b0C for LCC\nICCG)\nby water bath immersion, and the pH was regulated at 8.0 by adding\n4 M NaOH solution.

A total of 0.5 kg pretreated PET powder, 1.9 L of deio-\nnized water and 0.1 L of TurboPETase solution (containing 1 g of pur-\ni\ufb01ed enzyme) were combined in a 7.5 L bioreactor (New Brunswick\nScienti\ufb01c, Edison, NJ, USA).

For molecular weight analysis of PET,\ngel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was applied. GPC\nmeasurements were carried out using an Agilent 1260 system (Agilent\n1260, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) with a Refractive Index (RI)\ndetector.

      "text": "Computational redesign of an ef\ufb01cient PET hydrolase\nPET hydrolases belong to serine-hydrolase family, a widely distributed\ngroup known for their relatively low substrate speci\ufb01city. The degra-\ndation function of PET hydrolases is thought to preexist as a pro-\nmiscuous function, which then evolves into a primary function\n28,29.\nGiven our limited knowledge of how a sequence encodes catalytic\nfunctions in polymer-degrading enzymes\n30, addressing the challenge\nby exploiting physics-based computational redesign and rational\ndesign approaches is a dif\ufb01cult task. Alternatively, a successful\napproach involves utilizing deep learning models to map the process\nfrom protein sequence to function, as demonstrated in many cases\n31\u2013 33.\nThese models can capture hidden information indicating the\nimprovement in polymer degradation along the evolution trajectory\nfrom the relative\ufb01tness of protein variants. To this end, we employed a\nlanguage model trained on two datasets that involved approximately\n26,000 homologous sequences of PET hydrolases across evolution, to\npredict the probability of amino acid variation from the evolutionary\nlandscape (Fig.1A). To select the template enzyme, we compared the\nactivity of LCC, LCC\nICCG, BhrPETase, FastPETase, and HotPETase using\namorphous PET\ufb01lms (Gf-PET, from the supplier Goodfellow) across a\nrange of temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 2). BhrPETase shares a high\nsequence identity of 94% with LCC, whereas LCC\nICCG represents a var-\niant of LCC characterized by four amino acid substituents (F243I/\nD238C/S283C/Y127G). Both FastPETase and HotPETase are derivatives\nengineered fromIsPETase (Supplementary Fig. 3). At 65 \u00b0C, BhrPETase\nand LCCICCG exhibited the highest catalytic performance of all PET\nhydrolases and temperatures tested and were chosen as the inputs. A\nTransformer encoder was used to process input amino acid sequences\nwith absolute position embedding. Residue positions were sorted by\nthe mean of the logits of 19 mutations assigned to the wild type amino\nacid at each position. The top ten amino acid positions with the highest\naverage scores of each model were selected. After duplicated amino\nacid positions were removed, 18 amino acid positions at which the\nwild-type residues \ufb01t less well than potential substitutions were\nobtained (Supplementary Table 1).\nAccording to the crystal structures of BhrPETase (PDB code:\n7EOA)a n dL C C\nICCG S165A in complex with MHET (PDB code:7VVE34), 7\nof the 18 generated amino acid positions (W104, H164, M166, W190,\nH191, H218, and F/I243) were suggested to be embedded in a PET-\nbinding groove. Due to the relatively higher thermostability of\nBhrPETase, we subjected the 7 positions on this enzyme to generate 34\nvariants. Chen et al. reported that the Ser214/Ile218 double mutants of\nseveral IsPETase-homologous enzymes showed enhanced PET hydro-\nlysis activity (by at least 1.3-fold) but vastly decreasedT\nm values\n(by approximately 10 \u00b0C)35. Since His218 (corresponding to Ser214\nin IsPETase) was involved in our predicted candidates, the hydrolytic\nperformance of the H218S/F222I variant was also explored (Supple-\nmentary Table 2). Among the variants, BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I (referred to\nas BhrPETase M2) resulted in the highest improvements with a 1.7-fold\nincrease in PET-hydrolytic activity at 65 \u00b0C, rendering this variant the\nnew template for the second-round accumulation of the mutations at\nthe remaining 6 positions. During the 2nd accumulation stage, only\nmutations at W104 and F243 positions (W104L, W104S, W104H,\nW104G, F243I, F243T, and F243G) on M2 exhibited improved hydro-\nlytic activities (by 10% to 34%), albeit with signi\ufb01cant decrease in\nthermostability (Supplementary Table 3).\nEmpirical data have suggested that aT\nm 15 \u00b0C higher than theTopt\nis necessary for catalyst longevity27. Hence, a PET hydrolase with aTm\nat least over 80 \u00b0C is preferred for ef\ufb01cient PET degradation. Notably,\nthe M2 variant exhibited a melting temperature of 85 \u00b0C, which was\n11 \u00b0C lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The active mutations at\nthe W104 positions on M2 reduced the stability even further, withT\nm\nvalues ranging from 71.5 \u00b0C to 75.5 \u00b0C. The nonnegligible decrease in\nstability limited further combination, and compensatory mutations\nneeded to be introduced\ufb01rst to suppress the deleterious effects.\nTherefore, we applied our previously devised GRAPE strategy\n36,w h i c h\nemploys four complementary algorithms, namely, FoldX37 (force \ufb01eld\nenergy function), Rosetta_cartesian_ddg38 (force\ufb01eld energy function),\nABACUS39 (statistical energy function) and DDD40 (force \ufb01eld energy\nfunction), to design stabilizing mutations to compensate and buffer\nthe destabilizing mutations (Fig.1B). Upon experimental validation, 3\nbene\ufb01cial variants (A209R, D238K, and A251C-A281C) resulted in\nimproved thermostability without compromising the activity (Sup-\nplementary Table 4). We added the stabilizing variants to the M2 var-\niant using a stepwise combining strategy and resulted in a BhrPETase\nM6 variant (BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C), which exhibited a\nrestored melting temperature of 97 \u00b0C without sacri\ufb01cing activity.\nSubsequently, active mutations at the W104 and F243 positions were\ncombinatorically assembled and accumulated onto the thermostable\nM6 variant, generating 12 new variants (Fig.1C and Supplementary\nTable 5). After a consideration of both depolymerization performance\nand thermostability, the best combination variant, BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I/\nA209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T(referred to as TurboPETase), was selected\nwith aTm of 84 \u00b0C and a 3.4-fold improvement in PET-speci\ufb01c activity\ntowards GF-PET\ufb01lms compared to wild-type BhrPETase (Fig.1D). In\nindustrial scenarios, enzymatic hydrolysis is typically conducted in\nwater rather than in a dedicated buffered system to simplify down-\nstream processing. Aligned with the industrial preferences, we also\nevaluated the 12 variants under a low buffer concentration. The results\nrevealed that with the exception M6\nW104G/F243T, all variants largely\nretained their degrading activity in 100 mM potassium phosphate\nbuffer (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6). TurboPE-\nTase consistently outperformed the other variants under both low and\nhigh buffer concentrations, making it the most effective variant for\nfurther investigation.\nThe depolymerization performance of TurboPETase was subse-\nquently evaluated across a temperature range of 50\u2013 65 \u00b0C with respect\nto other PET hydrolases (Fig.2A, B, and Supplementary Fig. 5). At 65 \u00b0C,\nTurboPETase exhibited the highest overall degradation of all PET\nhydrolases and temperatures tested, releasing 29.66 mM of the pro-\nducts (sum of BHET, MHET, and TPA) in 3 h. Counterparts like\nBhrPETase, LCC, LCC\nICCG,I C C GI6M,a n dP E S - H 1L92F/Q94Y which exhibit high\ndegradation performance at elevated temperatures, rendered hydro-\nlytic activity 1.8-, 4.7-, 2.1-, 2.0-, and 19-fold lower than that of Turbo-\nPETase, respectively. At suboptimal temperatures, TurboPETase\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45662-9\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:1417 2\nconsistently outperformed other PET hydrolases, albeit the decreased\nhydrolytic activity. At the optimal temperature of HotPETase and\nCaPETaseM9 of 60 \u00b0C, TurboPETase generated 11.73 mM monomer\nproducts in 3 h, whereas HotPETase and CaPETaseM9 produced\n4.32 mM and 0.60 mM monomers, which were 1.7-, and 18-fold lower\nthan that of TurboPETase. When subjected to 50 \u00b0C, TurboPETase\nregistered hydrolytic ef\ufb01ciencies exceeding those of FastPETase and\nDepoPETase by 43% and 59%, respectively. In light of the lower enzyme\nconcentrations employed in certain reports, we recalibrated our\nreactions to mirror these conditions to ensure a fairer comparison\n(Fig. 2C\u2013 E). Under their reported reaction conditions, the reaction\nrates of LCC\nICCG, HotPETase, and FastPETase were 1.8-, 4.9-, and 1.0-fold\nlower, respectively, than that of TurboPETase. Recently, similar\nexperiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation perfor-\nmance of FastPETase, HotPETase, PES-H1L92F/Q94Y and LCCICCG under\nindustrial conditions41. Their results demonstrated that HotPETase\nexhibited a higher speci\ufb01c activity compared to PES-H1L92F/Q94Y at a low\nsubstrate loading of 2 g L\u22121. However, as the substrate concentrations\nincreased to 16.5% (w/w) and 20% (w/w), the PET conversion of Hot-\nPETase were signi\ufb01cantly lower than those of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y.T h i s\nreduced ef\ufb01ciency at higher substrate loadings is suggested to be\nattributed to the limited thermostability and other catalytic properties\nof HotPETase, such as product inhibition. Despite the good perfor-\nmance of PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y under industrially relevant conditions, the\ufb01nal\ndepolymerization was still lower than that achieved by LCCICCG.G i v e n\nthe reported enhancements of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y in 1 M potassium phos-\nphate buffer, we also compared TurboPETase with PES-H1L92F/Q94Y\nunder elevated buffer concentration, with TurboPETase still out-\npacing, yielding up to 2.5 times the degradation products of PES-H1\nL92F/\nQ94Y at 65 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 6). To evaluate the long-time stability\nof TurboPETase, we extended the reaction time. The results demon-\nstrated continuous enzyme performance of TurboPETase at elevated\ntemperatures, as it produced 130 mM of soluble monomer products\nover 12 h at 65 \u00b0C, whereas the released products with BhrPETase, LCC,\nLCC\nICCG were substantially lower (Supplementary Fig. 7). The degra-\ndation results highlight the substantially superior hydrolytic\nFig. 1 | Schematic representation of the redesign of PET hydrolases using the\nhybrid computational method.

C Schematic representation of the accumulation step. Mutations at the 7\nresidue positions located at the PET binding site were added to the wild type\nenzyme (BhrPETase), resulting in the best hit BhrPETase\nH218S/F222I (M2). Adding the\nmutations at the remaining 6 positions to M2 led to active variants with dramati-\ncally decreased stability, and therefore, the GRAPE strategy was employed. The\nstabilizing mutations were combined into M2 and resulted in the thermostable\nvariant M6, which can compensate for the destabilizing mutations in further\naccumulation steps.

As shown in Fig.3A, the curves exhibited\nnear-linear relationships for the initial rate and substrate loading under\nall conditions for TurboPETase, BhrPETase and LCC\nICCG. Conventional\nsaturation behaviour was not observed because even the lowest\nenzyme concentrations used here (0.12\u03bcM) were too high for the\nconventional approach to be valid, which indicates the very fast rates\nof dissociation of the enzymes from the PET surface. Additionally, we\nconducted a kinetic comparison for soluble substrates (MHET and\npNPB) as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 7.\nThe catalytic ef\ufb01ciency of TurboPETase towards MHET showed only a\nmodest enhancement relative to PET (with a 32% increase), suggesting\nthat there may be other factors, potentially increased adsorption to\nthe surface, contributing to the ampli\ufb01ed degradation ef\ufb01ciency of\nPET. Conversely, the slight decrement in TurboPETase\u2019s k\ncat for pNPB,\naccompanied by a reduced binding af\ufb01nity, inferred potential changes\nin the substrate binding domain, rendering it less conducive for other\nsmall molecule interactions.\nAlthough the hydrolysis of PET could not meet the criteria for the\nconventional approach, the inverse Michaelis\u2012Menten model was\nmore applicable. The inverse Michaelis\u2012Menten equation has been\nsuccessfully employed to study the kinetics of heterogeneous\nenzymes such as cellulases, by which the catalytic ef\ufb01cacy against\naccessible attack sites on the polymer surface can be estimated\n42\u2013 45.A s\na typical surface erosion process, enzymatic hydrolysis of PET can\nhardly permeate the inner core of the polymer, resulting in a limited\nnumber of super\ufb01cial ester bonds (also termed attack sites) being\naccessed even if the enzymes are in great excess. Saturation thus\noccurs when all sites on the surface become occupied, and the excess\nenzyme molecules accumulate in the solvent\n42. It should be noted that\nnot all adsorption sites are competent for catalytic conversion, non-\nspeci\ufb01c adsorption also accounts for a considerable proportion44.W e\nmeasured free enzyme concentrations,Efree, and converted it to sub-\nstrate coverage,\u0393 =( Etot - Efree)/SPET to calculated the total adsorption\nof the enzymes to PET surface (Supplementary Fig. 9 and\nFig. 2 | Comparison of depolymerization performance of TurboPETase with\nother known PET hydrolases.

Comparisons of these enzymes could be expanded by\nconsidering speci\ufb01c changes in inverse Michaelis\u2012Menten parameters,\nwhich can re\ufb02ect the binding capability to the attack sites of the PET\nsurface. As shown in Fig.3Ba n dT a b l e1,t h e\ninvKM values revealed\nmarginal differences between TurboPETase, BhrPETase, and LCCICCG,\nespecially for the values at 30 g kg\u22121 substrate loading, indicating that\nthe speci\ufb01c adsorption capacity of TurboPETase at the attack sites on\nthe PET surface was not impaired. It\u2019s noteworthy that TurboPETase\nexhibited a 2.1-fold increase ininvVmax/massS0 compared with BhrPETase\nand LCCICCG. The inverse parameter, maximal reaction velocity per\navailable reactive site (invVmax/massS0), speci\ufb01es the rate when all attack\nsites are covered with the enzyme42. Since no substantial differences in\ninvKM and \u0393max values were observed among the enzymes, the elevated\ninvVmax/massS0 values may imply a broadened targeting of TurboPETase\ntowards speci\ufb01c attack sites when the enzymes maintained a stable\noverall adsorption level. Consequently, we presumed that the\nenhanced depolymerization performance of TurboPETase may rely, at\nleast in part, on the enhanced ability to attack a broader spectrum of\nspeci\ufb01c attack sites that can be hydrolysed to form a productive\ncomplex.\nFig. 3 | Kinetic parameters and structural analysis of TurboPETase.\nA Conventional andB inverse Michaelis\u2012Menten plots of TurboPETase, BhrPETase,\nand LCCICCG at 65 \u00b0C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0.
