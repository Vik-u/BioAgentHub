These strains were isolated from 434 \nthe Himalaya mountains, Qinling mountains, Cheverny and Grenouillere France and the Netherlands 435 \n[42]. The Streptomyces plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 10 days or longer before investigating the 436 \nBHET degradation. E. coli was grown on Luria-Burtani (LB) agar or in LB cultures overnight at 37 \u00b0C.  437 \nRoutine Streptomyces manipulation, growth and preparation of spore stocks was performed according 438 \nto the Streptomyces manual  [53]. Spore suspensions were obtained by growing the strains on Soy 439 \nFlour Mannitol agar (SFM [54]) until sporulation.  440 \n 441 \nHomology search 442 \nPotential homologs of the PETase Ideonella sakaiensis (Uniprot A0A0K8P6T7 (PETH_IDESA)) in the 443 \nActinobacterial genomes were identified by performing a BLASTp for the genome of Streptomyces 444 \ncoelicolor (NCBI 100226) [35].  BLASTp was run in the default setting. The hits were ranked based on 445 \ntheir BLAST score, their query cover, their percent identity and the presence of the catalytic triad and 446 \nsubstrate binding site. 447 \n 448 \nBulk screens 449 \nThe strains are inoculated on the plates using the stamping method. A stamp fitting a 96-wells plate 450 \nwas autoclaved, placed in the stamping device and placed in the 96 wells plate, containing 100 \u03bc l of 451 \neach spore stock in separate wells, and stamped on the plates of interest.

In 486 \nthis system, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated double stranded break will be repaired via homology-directed 487 \nrepair. Two homologous arms of approximately 1000 bp with a 40 nt overlap at both sides of lipA have 488 \nbeen amplified via PCR on genomic DNA of M145. These homologous arms can be digested into the 489 \npCRISPomyces-2 via three-piece Gibson Assembly using the XbaI site. Additionally, a sgRNA will be 490 \nannealed into the plasmid using Golden Gate cloning. Primers for these homologous arms bordering 491 \nLipA and sgRNA were made using the protocol of Cobb and colleagues. Assembled plasmids were 492 \nconfirmed via sequencing. Assembled plasmids were transferred to Streptomyces coelicolor M145 via 493 \nconjugation with E. coli ET12567 harboring the pUZ8002 plasmid [58], [59]. Single colonies were 494 \nstreaked on SFM with apramycin [50 \u03bc g/ml] to check for true apramycin resistance. Resistant colonies 495 \nwere picked to TSBS for gDNA isolation. Correct gene knock-outs were confirmed via diagnostic PCR 496 \nand sequencing. Plasmid loss was achieved by restreaking strains for several generations on SFM 497 \nagar without antibiotic pressure at 37 \u00b0C and checking for the loss of apramycin resistance [50], [51].  498 \nTable 3: sgRNA and primers for homologous arms and diagnostic PCR 499 \nName  Sequence  Length (nt)  Tm  \nsgRNA1-F  ACGCTCCAGCATCGAAGCCCTGCG  24  80,7  \nsgRNA1-R  AAACCGCAGGGCTTCGATGCTGGA  24  78,2  \nJA_MC_F_HA1  TGCCGCCGGGCGTTTTTTATGGTCACCGGCC\nAGGACGA  \n38  92,2  \nJA_MC_F_HA2  CGTGCGGGCAGGTGTGGGGGTTCTGCTG  28  86,8  \nJA_MC_R_HA1  CCCCCACACCTGCCCGCACGGTTCCTGA  28  87,6  \nJA_MC_R_HA2  CTTTTTACGGTTCCTGGCCTCGTGAGGCTGAG\nCGTGAG  \n38  84,8  \nJA_MRJ_F_KO_S\nCO0713 \nGTGCACCGTTCGACGGACGA 20 69.8 \nJA_R1_MBT2/12_\nSCO0713 \nGTGCAGCAGAACCCCCACAC 20 68.8 \n 500 \nOverexpression strains were obtained by using the pSET152 integrative plasmid [60].

In this research, we investigate the PET degrading ability of the IsPETase 10 \nhomolog ScLipA from Streptomyces coelicolor. Of 96 different Streptomyces strains screened, 18 % 11 \nwere able to degrade the model substrate BHET. Three different variants of lipase A, named ScLipA, 12 \nS2LipA and S92LipA were identified and analyzed in detail. The lipA gene was deleted from S. 13 \ncoelicolor M145 using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in reduced BHET degradation. LipA overexpression in 14 \nthe knock-out background significantly enhanced BHET degradation. All three enzymes were 15 \nexpressed in E. coli BL21 for protein purification and biochemical analysis, showing that enzymatic 16 \nactivity most likely resides in a dimeric form of the enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature were 17 \ndetermined to be pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C for all three variants. Using these conditions, the activity on BHET 18 \nand amorphous PET film was investigated. S2LipA efficiently degraded BHET and caused roughening 19 \nand small indents on the surface of PET films, consistent with PET-degrading activity.

They are relatively easy and cheap to produce, extremely versatile and durable 27 \nmaterials, which makes them remarkably attractive for a wide range of applications [1], [2]. This has 28 \ncaused the demand and production of plastics to rise steadily to an estimated 9.2 billion metric tons 29 \n(Mt) produced as of 2023 [1], [3], [4]. Of all plastic produced, 75 % (6.9 billion Mt) has been 30 \nmismanaged or landfilled [4]. Durability and resistance to degradation of these polymers, combined 31 \nwith the increasing output of waste generated by humans, makes plastic accumulation and pollution a 32 \nmajor global environmental concern [5]. In fact, commonly used plastics are generally not 33 \nbiodegradable, accumulate in landfills or leak into terrestrial and/or aquatic environments, where they 34 \ndisintegrate into micro- and nano-plastics, thereby posing a serious threat to many ecosystems [5].  35 \nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) is extensively used to produce bottles, food packaging, clothing and 36 \nfilms. The high demand for PET makes it one of the most common plastics that we encounter in 37 \neveryday life with 18.8 million tons being produced worldwide in 2015 alone [6]. PET waste 38 \nmanagement in most countries today consists mainly of incineration and landfilling. Both practices are 39 \ncausing detrimental effects to the environment, such as leaching and the release of toxic compounds 40 \n[7]. On the other hand, an increasing number of countries have recycling systems in place to prevent 41 \nenvironmental accumulation and make renewed use of the PET waste produced. Despite such efforts, 42 \nthe recovery ratio is far less than 50 % and only a minor fraction is used to manufacture new products, 43 \nwith substantial amounts of PET still entering the environment [8].  44 \nWith plastic waste accumulating in the environment, investigating the adaptation and response of soil 45 \nand aquatic microorganisms to plastic exposure has proven eminent. Microbial response and 46 \nadaptation mechanisms are likely to help battle plastic pollution and initiate remediation and recycling 47 \noptions. Enzymatic degradation already has proven to enable natural routes to depolymerize these 48 \nrecalcitrant polymeric materials. Several PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) have been identified, 49 \ninitiating biodegradation of this polymer. Predominantly, these are esterases, lipases, cutinases and 50 \ncutinase-like enzymes exhibiting hydrolysis of the ester bond between terephthalic acid (TPA) and 51 \nethylene glycol (EG) moieties within the PET polymer [9]\u2013[14]. It was not until 2016 that Yoshida and 52 \ncolleagues reported the discovery of a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (hereafter I. 53 \nsakaiensis), which had evolved towards the degradation and utilization of PET as a sole carbon 54 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The enzyme identified as responsible for the first step in the catabolism of PET is the 55 \nIsPETase (ISF6_4831), classified as an extracellular esterase. This enzyme hydrolyses PET into its 56 \nmonomer mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with only trace amounts of bis(2-57 \nhydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) being observed. To complete the 58 \nbreakdown of PET, I. sakaiensis possesses another enzyme, the Is MHETase (ISF6_0224), which is 59 \ncapable of hydrolyzing MHET into TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), common starting chemicals to 60 \npolymerize PET [15]. Compared to other PHEs which have a broader range of substrates, the 61 \nIsPETase displays significantly higher activity against BHET, PET films, and commercial bottle-derived 62 \nPET at 40 \u00b0C [15]. Currently, all PETase-like enzymes are described in the PAZY-database [16]. 63 \nMany genera of soil and aquatic bacteria are exposed to accumulated plastics. An important phylum of 64 \nbacteria remaining to be investigated is the Actinobacteria. This phylum consists of various complex 65 \ngenera such as Thermobifida, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and many more. Several enzymes of 66 \nactinobacterial origin such as the LCC, TfCut2 and many more have previously been identified and 67 \ncharacterized to exhibit PET degradi ng abilities ear ning their place in the PAZY database [9]\u2013[11], 68 \n[13], [16]\u2013[19]. However, for various other genera including Streptomyces only limited information is 69 \navailable [20]\u2013[25]. Only one Streptomyces enzyme, SM14est has been described [21].  70 \nStreptomycetes are filamentous growing soil-dwelling bacteria with a characteristic lifecycle. They are 71 \nrenowned for their capability to produce antibiotics but are also known to excrete enzymes to degrade 72 \ncomplex natural polymers, including plant biomass [26]\u2013[28]. Depending on the soil pollution rate and 73 \nthe distance to the polluted area, it is possible to recover 7,5 x 10 4 to 3,0 x 10 4 plastic microparticles 74 \nper kilogram (kg) of soil [29]. This equates to 2-20 milligrams (mg) of recoverable plastic particles per 75 \nkg of soil [29]. Hence, the rhizosphere and its associated microbes, such as Streptomyces are 76 \nextensively exposed to plastics. This exposure to plastics and their ability to degrade complex biomass 77 \nwith hydrolytic enzymes makes them a promising genus to explore for novel PHEs [20]\u2013[25], [30], [31]. 78 \nThese possible PHEs are expected to be secreted enzymes. Expression of enzymes in Streptomyces 79 \nis a highly regulated process and hence, such regulation will likely play an important role in putative 80 \nPET degrading activity [32].  81 \nIn this research, we identified Lipase A from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScLipA) as a  homolog to the 82 \nIsPETase. Consequently, we investigated the ability of S. coelicolor to degrade the PET model 83 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Conservation of this BHET degrading ability was investigated by screening a 84 \ncollection of 96 previously isolated Actinobacteria (predominantly Streptomyces) under various 85 \nconditions [33]. This yielded insight into the optimal conditions needed to induce BHET degradation as 86 \nwell as in the abundance of strains exhibiting BHET-degrading capability. In one or more of the 87 \nprovided conditions, 44 % of the strains could degrade BHET, 18 % of the evaluated strains were able 88 \nto degrade BHET individually confirming a wider distribution of this ability in nature. The presence of 89 \nLipA in these strains was explored and the corresponding genes were sequenced. The enzyme is 90 \nhighly conserved and can be classified into three different variants. The S. coelicolor variant further 91 \nnamed ScLipA, the MBT92 variant (S92LipA) which is only present in MBT92, and a conserved variant 92 \npresent in all other active strains ( S2LipA). The functionality of all three LipA variants in the 93 \ndegradation ability of BHET and amorphous PET in Streptomyces species was investigated. A knock-94 \nout of the lipA gene was constructed in S. coelicolor M145, and overexpression constructs of the three 95 \nvariants were expressed in the knock-out to study the effect of the genes in vivo.  The individual 96 \nenzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli  and purified for the analysis of substrate specificity, 97 \nthermostability, and other properties.  Enzyme characteristics were examined using enzyme assays 98 \nand liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Additionally, the strains, as well as the 99 \npurified enzymes, were incubated on amorphous PET films to investigate their true ability to adhere to 100 \nand degrade PET.  101"

The catalytic 114 \ntriad was conserved, as well as two of the three residues of the previously described substrate binding 115 \nsite (Fig. 1E and F) [36]. The difference in the binding site is a phenylalanine in LipA instead of a 116 \ntyrosine in Is PETase, as shown in figure 1E. The high similarity and the presence of the important 117 \nresidues for PET degradation hint towards the putative PET degrading activity of the Streptomyces 118 \ncoelicolor lipase A (ScLipA). On the N-terminal end of the protein, a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) 119 \nsignal is present indicating that the natural substrate of this enzyme is located outside of the cell [38]. 120 \nIndeed, for plastics-degrading enzymes, extracellular activity appears to be essential.  121 \n 122 \n 123 \nFigure 1: Sequence and structure comparison of IsPETase and ScLipA.   124 \nA) sequence comparison of the IsPETase and ScLipA indicating the binding sites with yellow asterisks 125 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Due to its limited solubility, 134 \nthe addition of BHET causes the plates to become turbid. When BHET is converted to MHET and/or 135 \nTPA, a halo of clearance appears. The secreted enzyme activity was expected to be tightly regulated 136 \nin response to environmental growth conditions [32]. Therefore, we tested N-acetyl glucosamine 137 \n(GlcNAc) as a possible inducer of secreted enzyme activity. GlcNAc is a monomer of chitin and 138 \npeptidoglycan, which under poor nutritional conditions induces development and antibiotic production 139 \nin Streptomyces coelicolor [39], [40], whereas in nutrient-rich environments these responses are 140 \nblocked [35]. We anticipated that GlcNAc may act as an inducer for the production of extracellular 141 \nenzymes such as lipases, esterases and possibly BHET-degrading enzymes. Hence, S. coelicolor 142 \nM145 was grown in the presence and absence of BHET [10 mM], mannitol [25 mM] and N-acetyl 143 \nglucosamine [25 mM] in all possible combinations.  144 \nInterestingly, a clearance halo was observed at 18 days of growth as shown in figure 2A. Notably, 145 \nfigure 2A displays that the addition of GlcNAc as inducer seemed to induce the degradation of BHET. 146 \nAdditionally, S. coelicolor produces agarase, which resulted in \u2018sinking\u2019 halos which you can see in the 147 \ncontrols without BHET (Fig. 2A, StrepMM) [41]. These \u2018sinking halos\u2019 looked very similar to clearance 148 \nhalos. Therefore, the ability S. coelicolor to degrade BHET in liquid culture was investigated using 149 \nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  For the liquid analysis, strain M145 was 150 \nprecultured and inoculated in minimal liquid medium without polyethylene glycol (NMM) with and 151 \nwithout BHET and GlcNAc. Samples were taken after 24 h and 72 h and analyzed using LC-MS. In the 152 \nnegative ionization mode, the mass of TPA (166 g/mol) could be observed around 4 min retention time 153 \nshowing a small peak on the UV spectrum, MHET (210 g/mol) appeared around 5.2 min with a strong 154 \nsignal on both the MS as well as the UV. Finally, BHET (255 g/mol) could be observed in the positive 155 \nionization mode between 5.5 and 6 min with a strong signal at 240 nm (Fig. 2B and 2C). Around 9.5 156 \nmin, impurity was observed, which was present in the BHET stock (Fig. 2C). When grown in NMM 157 \nmedium containing BHET, 30-50 % of the BHET was degraded within 24 h, after 72 h, all BHET was 158 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Indeed, the addition of GlcNAc enhanced the degradation of 159 \nBHET (Fig. 2D).  160 \n 161 \nFigure 2: The ability of S. coelicolor M145 to degrade BHET .   162 \nA) Degradation of BHET by S. coelicolor after 18 days of growth on Strep MM Difco agar with and 163 \nwithout Mannitol, BHET and GlcNAc B) LC-MS trace of BHET in positive ionization, MHET and TPA in 164 \nthe negative ionization.

Growth of these strains appeared to be 176 \ndelayed with 10 mM BHET, and impaired with 20 mM BHET and higher concentrations. Hence, a 177 \nconcentration of 10 mM of BHET was chosen for screening, with all tested strains able to grow and 178 \nhalos readily observed (Fig. 3A).  179 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Seven strains did not grow on the plates and were 182 \ntaken out of the screen. Spore suspensions were stamped onto plates containing StrepMM with 183 \ndifferent agar brands containing combinations of BHET [10 mM], Mannitol [25 mM] and GlcNAc [25 184 \nmM]. The type of agar used clearly impacted the observed degradation patterns. The agar brand 185 \nseems to have a clear influence on the degradation pattern (Supplement 1). Difco agar was chosen as 186 \nthe agar source for all further experiments since most strains showed growth on Difco agar. The 187 \naddition of GlcNAc resulted in a different halo pattern and more predominant halos during the bulk 188 \nscreen and induced BHET degradation in most strains (Fig 3B, Supplement 1).  189 \nActinobacteria, especially Streptomyces, depend on environmental cues and interspecies interactions 190 \nfor the induction of enzymes and secondary metabolites [43]. Consequently, it was important to 191 \ninvestigate their individual BHET degrading activity on separate plates. All strains showing halos in the 192 \nbulk BHET screen were grown on individual plates (Supplement 2). Of 38 active strains, only 17 193 \nstrains exhibited individual activity on BHET after 10 days of growth (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, most 194 \nstrains required the addition of GlcNAc to express the BHET degrading enzyme. Only 5 strains, MBT5, 195 \n12, 15, 91 and 92 degraded BHET in the absence of GlcNAc. MBT92 appeared to exhibit constitutive 196 \nexpression showing a similar-sized halo in all conditions. To substantiate a good correlation between 197 \nhalo size and biochemical degradation, strains MBT2, 5, 12, 28, 92 and S. coelicolor M145 were 198 \nincubated with approximately 2*10 6 spores on StrepMM Difco plates containing BHET and GlcNAc. 199 \nSamples of agar were taken after 15 days using an agar excision tool to cut out part of the halo. Since 200 \nS. coelicolor M145 displayed no activity after 15 days (see also above), halos were excised after 18 201 \ndays. Samples were spun down using nylon spin columns, separating all liquids from the agar, and 202 \nprepped for LC-MS analysis (Fig. 3D). In all strains, clear conversion from BHET to MHET was 203 \nobserved. MBT2, 5, 12, and 28 show traces of TPA suggesting further conversion of MHET.  204 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The less cultivated 249 \nareas did not show significant damage over the control film suggesting that either more biomass is 250 \nneeded to observe degradation, or no PET degradation was achieved.  251 \nKnock-out and overexpression of the three lipA variants in S. coelicolor 252 \nTo obtain a better understanding of the role and function of LipA in vivo, a lipA knock-out mutant was 253 \nconstructed in S. coelicolor M145.

This resulted in strain S3 expressing SclipA, 259 \nS5 expressing S2lipA and S7 expressing S92lipA. Two expression media were chosen namely NMM 260 \nas minimal medium with a defined carbon source and rich medium tryptic soy broth sucrose (TSBS) 261 \nwhich is a protein expression medium. Expression was validated on both media using SDS page and 262 \nWestern blot (Fig. 6A-B and 6D-E). Both NMM with 5 % (w/v) glucose and TSBS show clear signal on 263 \nwestern blot indicating that the enzyme is expressed.  264 \nBHET degradation was examined in vivo by inoculating 1,0*108 spores in 50 ml of NMM with glucose 265 \n[5 % (v/v)] and BHET or TSBS containing BHET. Samples were taken at 24, 48 and 72 h and analyzed 266 \nusing LC-MS. The percentages BHET, MHET and TPA were calculated over the total peak area. After 267 \n24 h, while the spores are still germinating, limited activity is observed. After 48 h, on NMM, the knock-268 \nout shows significantly less activity on BHET than the wildtype strain. After 72 h, there is a clear 269 \ndifference in the degradation pattern of the knock-out compared to the wildtype strain. The 270 \noverexpression constructs show 40-50 % degradation, which is similar to the wildtype strain, although 271 \nit is significantly higher than in the knock-out strain (parental strain) (Fig. 6C). Some residual activity, 272 \nnot related to LipA, was still observed in the knock-out strain.    273 \nAfter 48 h on TSBS, there was no difference observed in the BHET degrading ability of the wildtype 274 \nstrain compared to the knock-out strain; After 72 h, the wildtype strain degraded significantly more 275 \nBHET than the knock-out strain. Unlike minimal medium, the strains containing the overexpressed lipA 276 \nvariants showed drastic BHET degradation on TSBS after 48 h, with some variation between the 277 \ndifferent enzyme variants (Fig. 6F). After 72 h, the knock-out converted approximately 23 % of the 278 \nBHET to MHET, whereas the wild-type strain converted approximately 32 %, the overexpression 279 \nstrains degraded all BHET after 72 h and TPA could be observed in the medium. The knock-out still 280 \nshowed some activity suggesting the presence of at least one other enzyme with BHET degrading 281 \nactivity. A two-way ANOVA clearly indicated the statistical significance of the results (S8).  282 \nTo observe physical changes within the cultures, automated time-lapse microscopy imaging was used 283 \nto follow and visualize the development of the strains and degradation of the BHET. This microscope 284 \ncan make brightfield images at time intervals resulting in a timelapse video (S9). It takes all strains 285 \naround 10 h to start developing (Fig. 7). Initially, no or only slight changes were observed in the 286 \npresence and shape of the BHET crystals but over time the BHET crystals roughened and 287 \ndisappeared.

However, and importantly, the abundance of micro-organisms that 384 \nhave adapted to utilization and degradation of plastics is not known, and evolution and conservation of 385 \ngenes and proteins involved remains largely unexplored.  386 \nIn this research, we have investigated plastics degrading activity of an IsPETase homolog Lipase A 387 \n(LipA) from Streptomyces coelicolor.

The three variants ScLipA (present in S. coelicolor), S92LipA (present in MBT92 395 \nand S2LipA (present all other active strains) were further investigated. The in vivo activity of Sc LipA 396 \nwas investigated by comparing a knock-out strain with the wildtype strain, in both rich and minimal 397 \nmedium; the knock-out exhibited a significant decrease in its BHET degrading activity. Since some 398 \nremaining BHET degradation was still observed in the knock-out strain, at least one other enzyme is 399 \nlikely to be involved in BHET degradation. However, this activity most likely resides with another type 400 \nof enzyme since no other IsPETase homolog was found during the homology search. All three LipA 401 \nvariants, when expressed in the knock-out background under a semi-constitutive promoter, exhibited 402 \nsignificantly enhanced degradation of BHET compared to the wildtype, on both rich and minimal 403 \nmedium. The variant enzymes were expressed in E. coli , purified and subjected to enzyme assays. 404 \nInterestingly, after purification, two clear bands are visible at ~30 kDa and ~60 kDa. Native enzyme 405 \nanalysis via a zymogram indicated that activity only resided with the higher band, suggesting that the 406 \nactive form was a dimer. Indeed, 3D-structure prediction with AlphaFold-multimer suggested the 407 \nformation of a dimeric enzyme with a probability of 90 % (S11) [47].  408 \nAll enzyme variants were found to have an optimal pH of 7 and optimal temperature of 25 \u00b0C. 409 \nColorimetric BHET assays confirmed BHET degrading activity of S2LipA and Sc LipA under optimal 410 \nconditions. Additionally, incubation of amorphous PET film with purified S2LipA caused the formation 411 \nof indents and roughening of the surface, similar to the activity of PET-degrading cutinase TfCut2, 412 \nfurther confirming PETase-like activity.  413 \nOur data suggests that PET is not the main substrate for these enzymes and that PET degradation 414 \nmerely appears as a moonlighting effect of the lipase activity, similar to the moonlighting effect 415 \ndescribed for TfCut2. S92LipA and ScLipA showed less activity than S2LipA which most probably is 416 \ndue to structural variations in the enzymes caused by the various amino acid substitutions. For 417 \nexample, S2LipA contains a region rich in serines close to important substrate binding residues and 418 \nthe substrate binding cleft (Fig. 4I) as opposed to S92LipA and ScLipA. This may result in enhanced 419 \nformation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate and/or enhanced enzyme stability [48]\u2013[50]. 420 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Since all of the strains in our study 422 \nare environmental isolates, we hypothesize that the abundance of S2LipA in these strains is initially 423 \ncaused by evolution towards a more stable and hydrophobic lipase and not toward plastic degradation 424 \nper se. Yet, current pollution rates may push environmental evolution of those enzymes towards 425 \nenhanced PET affinity. The current abundance of PET-degrading enzymes in nature indicates that 426 \nnature can indeed take on the challenge of degradation and bioremediation.
