The techniques discussed in the following section are biophysical methods com-\nmonly employed to investigate interface-related problems, enabling the determination of binding \naf\ufb01nities, surface interactions, protein mobility, and the kinetics of the process. \nLangmuir isotherms are commonly used to determine protein binding to insoluble substrates. \nThis model \ndescribes the adsorption of protein molecules onto a homogeneous solid substrate \nsurface with identical binding sites, assuming independent protein binding, monolayer formation, \nand reversible binding. Despite their simplicity, the Langmuir isotherms are often overlooked in \nPET hydrolase studies. Nonetheless, in one study the method was applied to measure the inter-\nactions between semi-crystalline PET powder and three different PET hydrolases, two cutinases \n(TfC and HiC from Humicola insolens) and a variant of the IsPETase, under conditions of both en-\nzyme and substrate excess [65]. The binding process was reasonably described by a Langmuir \nisot\nherm, indicating a strong af\ufb01nity for the PET substrate, with dissociation constants consis-\ntently below 150 nM. The saturated substrate coverage for all three enzymes roughly \ncorresponded to a monolayer on the PET surface.

In another study, \nLangmuir isotherms identi\ufb01ed that fusing CBMs to a variant of LCC improved the af\ufb01nity of the en-\nzyme to PET [72]. Binding isotherms, along with zeta potential measurements that quantify the \nelectrical \ncharge on the surface of particles such as proteins in a liquid, helped explain the differ-\nences in activity as a function of salt concentration for several HiC homologs. \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nAn inverse Michaelis\u2013Menten approach has been used to assess the kinetics of PET hydrolases \nand their interaction with the PET surface. Besides the kinetic parameters, this approach provides \nthe number of attack sites on the PET surface. Speci\ufb01cally, one kinetic data set is collected using \nthe conventional method with the substrate in excess, while another is collected in an inverse con-\ncentration regime with enzyme in excess (Figure 3A) [9]. This approach has been applied using either \nPET p\nowder or \ufb01lm of varying crystallinity, yielding substrate af\ufb01nity, turnover rate, catalytic ef\ufb01ciency, \nand the ability to identify attack sites on PET, thereby facilitating the identi\ufb01cation of rate-limiting steps \n[9,15,88\u201391]. For example, it was used to compare an engineered PET hydrolase, TurboPETase, \nwith other \nPET hydrolases. It was suggested that TurboPETase\u2019s enhanced depolymerization per-\nformance may, at least in part, be due to its improved ability to target a broader range of speci\ufb01c a t -\ntack sites that can be hydrolyzed [88].

The degradation of the PET \ufb01lm on the sensor surface by PET hydrolases is \nfollowed by the change in mass over time.\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8713\nstudy the effect of the surfactant cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the enzymatic activity \nand strength of enzyme\u2013PET interactions of LCC and TfC [9]. CTAB consistently reduced the inter-\naction \nstrength, while its effect on enzymatic turnover exhibited a strong biphasic response. Initially, \nincreasing the concentration of CTAB enhanced turnover, but beyond a certain point, the turnover \nwas suppressed. This correlation re\ufb02ects the Sabatier principle [9].\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), combined with thermokinetic models, was employed to \nconduct a detailed analysis of the degradation process of PET nanoparticles by TfC2 [92]. An in-\nv\nerse Michaelis\u2013Menten-based model was used for the data analysis. The results determined \nthat about 95% of the heat produced during PET degradation can be attributed to the heat of re-\naction, while only about 5% was due to the heat of adsorption. \nThe effect of surface mutations on a PET hydrolase, PET2, identi\ufb01ed from a metagenome library, \nwas \ninvestigated using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This tech-\nnique enables single-molecule imaging, allowing for the tracking of binding rate constants \n(Figure 3B). The most active mutant exhibited an increased binding rate constant, which was sug-\nges\nted to explain its higher activity compared with the WT enzyme [37]. In another study, TIRF \nmi\ncroscopy was combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) mi-\ncroscopy to examine how two green \ufb02uorescence protein (GFP) labeled PET hydrolases, LCC \nand PES-H1 (aka PHL7), and their CBM fusion variants attach and detach from a PET surface. \nTIRF microscopy was optimized for measuring the on and off rates of the enzymes, while \nFRAP microscopy was used to assess the dynamic movement rates of proteins across the \nPET surface. The study showed that adsorption and desorption dominate over lateral diffusion \n[93]. Similarly, single-molecule binding dynamics of quantum dot-labeled IsPETase were studied \nus\ning TIRF microscopy. Speci\ufb01cally, the landing rate and the binding duration were measured. \nThe binding durations were well described by a biexponential model, featuring a fast population \ninterpreted as active binding events and a slow population representing nonspeci\ufb01c binding inter-\nactions [94]. Additionally, a simpli\ufb01ed form of TIRF microscopy was utilized to study enzyme den-\nsity \nand distribution on the PET surface, providing insights into the protein concentration-\ndependent activity reduction of IsPETase [95]. \nThe quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is a method that al-\nlows \nfor real-time monitoring of PET hydrolysis, enabling the determination of depolymerization \nkinetics. This was demonstrated for TfC2 and its mutants, where QCM-D was used to analyze \nthe degradation kinetics of PET spun-coated onto a gold sensor (Figure 3C), which revealed \ntwo \ndistinct phases: an \u2018initial hydrolysis phase\u2019 and a \u2018fast hydrolysis phase\u2019 [97]. Furthermore, \nearlier \nresearch employed QCM to evaluate the effects of fusing binding proteins including \nCBMs to a PET hydrolase on the hydrolysis kinetics [69]. \nThermal treatment of a WCCG variant of LCC was shown to enhance PET hydrolysis. To eluci-\ndate the underlying reasons, atomic force microscopy-single-molecule force spectros-\ncopy (AFM-SMFS) w a s e m p l o y e d t o a s s e s s e n z y m e a d s o r p t i o n t o a P E Ts u r f a c e[89]. This \nmethod uses \na sharp AFM tip to apply controlled forces to a single molecule measuring the forces \nneeded to unfold or detach it from a surface, providing detailed insights into molecular interac-\ntions, binding strengths, and conformational changes [98]. Untreated and thermally treated en-\nzyme were applied to the AFM tip and approached a PET \ufb01lm. Thermally treated enzyme \nshowed higher adhesion force than the untreated one. It was hypothesized that thermal treat-\nment increases the hydrophobicity of the protein surface [89]. AFM-SMFS was also used to dem-\nonstrate \nthat hydrophobic anchor peptides promote adhesive interactions between HotPETase \nfused with different anchor peptides and the PET surface [14].\n714 Trends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nWe \ufb01nd it important to note that the outcome of all the experimental methods described depends \non the properties of the PET substrate. The degree of crystallinity is crucial when assaying and \ncomparing the activity of PET hydrolases on insoluble PET, with enzymatic activity increasing \nwhen the crystallinity decreases [18,23,73,83]. However, crystallinity is an overall estimate and \ndoes \nnot re\ufb02ect the speci\ufb01c properties of the PET surface where the PET hydrolases act. \nSome PET hydrolases create holes in the substrate, likely targeting amorphous areas of the sub-\nstrate surface [83]. So far, no experimental framework has yet fully captured the relationship be-\ntwee\nn PET surface morphology and PET hydrolase activity [99]. Single-molecule microscopy \nmethods \nand QCM-D face challenges in preparing the PET surface, as PET is dissolved in an or-\nganic solvent before being cast onto a cover slip. This process results in a PET layer that is not \ndirectly comparable with insoluble PET substrates used in activity analyses. Furthermore, PET au-\nto\ufb02uorescence issues require pretreatment of the PET surface and extensive data processing \n[37,93]. \nMolecular simulations for studying PET surface\u2013PET hydrolase interactions"

By allowing precise control over variables like \nsurface morphology and molecular interactions, simulations can provide detailed insights into \nmechanistic relationships that are challenging to capture experimentally; however, they also \ncome with their own challenges, which are discussed later. While the docking and QM/MM sim-\nulations provide crucial insights into the processes within the active site (discussed earlier), they \nare not able to explain how the enzymes adsorb on the PET material and how PET reaches the \nactive site. These questions can be addressed by classical MD simulations where PET is modeled \nas a material in its amorphous, crystalline, or mixed amorphous/crystalline state (Figure 2) and the \nrespect\nive enzyme is placed above the material to monitor the adsorption process. \nIn the study by Sahihi et al., the adsorption of LCCICCG on amorphous PET consisting of PET-\n9mer chains at 65\u00b0C was simulated [100]. The enzyme was always positioned such that the ac-\ntive \nsite faced the PET material and was only about 5 \u00c5 away. Consequently, the enzyme always \nbound with the same area to the PET surface, and this interaction occurred rapidly and was me-\ndiated by hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between PET chains and various \namino \nacid residues of the cutinase enzyme.

Their \ufb01ndings indicated that initial adsorption is predominantly nonspeci\ufb01c, occur-\nring \nin both proximal and distal regions relative to the enzymes\u2019 active site, with minimal protein \nreorientation taking place on the PET surface, even when extending simulations to 2 \u03bcs \n(Figure 4 A). Interaction energy analysis disclosed that mainly polar and hydrophobic interactions \ndrive \nadsorption, while repulsion occurs with negatively charged residues, which are more prev-\nalent in PES-H1 compared with LCC (Figure 4B). To further explore the role of speci\ufb01c a m i n o \na\ncids in PET interactions, surface residues were mutated to weaken PET binding, primarily re-\nplacing positively charged and polar residues with negatively charged ones or alanine \n(Figure 4C,D). In silico simulations of the resulting triple mutants guided the selection for in vitro \ntesting \nusing the inverse Michaelis \u2013Menten approach, but the LCC mutant could not be \nexpressed despite mutations being distant from the active site. Meanwhile, the PES-H1 T11V/ \nS13A/S14A mutant exhibited signi\ufb01cantly reduced PET degradation activity. This observation \naligns with the Sabatier principle, indicating that the PES-H1 triple mutant may have weakened \ninteractions too much for optimal catalysis [ 8].

[8]. \nSince J\u00e4ckering et al. did not observe PET-9mer penetration into the binding cleft during their \n2 \u03bcs MD simulations at 30\u00b0C, this indicates an energy barrier impeding PET entry into the active \nsite. \nTo investigate this further, they employed Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dy-\nnamics (HREMD), modifying the energy function of PET to enhance its mobility at higher rep-\nlicas, thereby allowing exploration of PET entry for the \ufb01rst time in LCC and PES-H1 [8]. This \napproa\nch con\ufb01rmed the energy barrier\u2019s presence, attributed to intramolecular PET\u2013PET interac-\ntions needing resolution before PET could insert into the binding cleft, along with intermolecular \nPET\u2013residue interactions hindering productive binding poses. It was found that raising the tem-\nperature to 70\u00b0C could overcome the obstructive PET\u2013PET interactions, partly explaining why \nenzymatic PET degradation is generally more ef\ufb01cient at higher temperatures (Table 1).

While enzymes have evolved to effectively target nat-\nural substrates, the presence of these enzymes that can degrade PET is surprising at \ufb01rst glance. \nHowever, upon closer examination, one \ufb01nds that there are hydrolysable synthetic polymers like \nPET that share structural similarities, such as ester bonds, with natural polyesters like cutin, which \nare substrates for hydrolases. Thermobi\ufb01da fusca cutinase (TfC) was the \ufb01rst PET-degrading en-\nzyme discovered, as described in 2005 [1]. \nSince then, a number of PET hydrolases have been identi\ufb01ed and advanced [2], including the \nlea\nf compost cutinase (LCC) and polyester hydrolase I (PES-H1, also known as PHL7) which \nwere both derived from compost metagenome libraries in 2014 [3] and 2022 [4], respectively. \nLCC \nshows high activity against PET and exhibits cutinase-like properties, enabling the enzyme \nto break down polymer structures effectively. Building on this natural enzyme, the French \ncompany CARBIOS utilized the ICCG variant of LCC (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G) [5], en-\nab\nling them to successfully launch the \ufb01rst enzymatic PET recycling demonstration plant in \n2021 with plans to open a larger facility with a recycling capacity of 130 tons per day in 2025 \n(https://www.carbios.com/en/enzymatic-recycling/ ). Although PES-H1 is somewhat less ac-\ntive \nthan LCC [6], it is of industrial interest, as well, as it demonstrates a broader substrate \nsp\neci\ufb01city that could be enhanced further through a two-enzyme system, similar to that em-\nployed by Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bacterium can effectively metabolize PET using \nthe enzymes IsPETase and MHETase, which facilitate the complete degradation of PET into \nbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), ulti-\nmately producing the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) [7]. \nTable 1 summarizes key wild-type (WT) and mutant PET hydrolases, detailing their enzymatic \ncharac\nteristics on both amorphous and crystalline PET substrates, along with the temperatures \nat which these parameters were measured.

To address this, Arnal et al. developed a stan-\ndardized protocol for larger-scale studies, applying it to four PET hydrolases [16]. Their \ufb01ndings \nide\nnti\ufb01ed that FAST-PETase and HotPETase are unsuitable for large-scale applications due to \nlow depolymerization rates, while PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y (PES-H1FY ) could be a promising candi-\ndate with 80% depolymerization upon further enzyme evolution. LCCICCG excelled, achieving \n98% PET conversion to TPA and EG in 24 h, and they improved its economic viability by reducing \nenzyme usage by a factor of 3 and lowering the reaction temperature from 72\u00b0C to 68\u00b0C. None-\ntheless, further optimization is crucial for enhancing the catalytic ef\ufb01ciency and environmental im-\npact of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, as current life cycle assessments show that enzymatic PET \nrecycling still lags behind virgin PET production in most categories [17]. Therefore, we will \ufb01rst ex-\namine the individual steps of the catalytic cycle, which present several opportunities for enzyme \nimprovement, before focusing on the initial step: the adsorption of PET hydrolases onto the \nPET material.\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nThe catalytic cycle and potential intervention points for engineering PET hydrolases \nPET degradation by PET hydrolases can be considered as heterogeneous catalysis, w h e r e \nthe catalyst is in a different phase (here solution) than the substrate (here solid). Consequently, \nthe catalytic cycle involves the following steps (Figure 1). (i) Adsorption: the PET hydrolase must \n\ufb01rst \ncome into contact with the surface of PET; (ii) enzyme\u2013substrate complex formation: a PET \nchain must enter into the active site of the enzyme and adopt a pose ready for the hydrolysis re-\naction to take place; (iii) catalytic action: the PET hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction by \ncleaving the ester bond(s) in the polymer chain; and (iv) product release: after the reaction, the \nproducts (e.g., shorter PET chains, BHET, MHET, TPA, and EG) must be released from the active \nsite of the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to be free for additional catalytic cycles.\nInsoluble substrates like PET present unique challenges for enzymes. Unlike soluble substrates \ntha\nt easily dissolve in water and are accessible to enzymes, insoluble substrates remain solid \nand often possess complex structures that enzymes must navigate. The enzymatic hydrolysis \nof PET primarily involves surface erosion, where the outer polymer layer is degraded to expose \ninner material. Due to the inability of water and enzyme molecules to penetrate the polymer\u2019s \ncore, only a limited number of ester bonds are accessible for enzymatic action. Additionally, inter-\nfacial enzymes, such as PET hydrolases, must overcome attractive forces within the substrate \nmatrix to form a productive enzyme\u2013substrate complex. \nBased on the PET hydrolase catalytic cycle, one can focus on one or more of the four major steps \nto in\ncrease its ef\ufb01ciency. Most approaches so far emphasize optimizing the second and third \nsteps, speci\ufb01cally the binding of PET in the active site and the catalytic reaction. It is important \nto consider the material properties of PET, a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with linear polymer \nstrands forming both amorphous and crystalline regions (Figure 2). The mobility of the PET chains \nis temper\nature-dependent, transitioning from rigidity below the glass transition temperature \n(Tg) t o \ufb02exibility above it.

This physical \naging b\negins above 72\u00b0C for amorphous PET in an aqueous environment [5]. Therefore, devel-\noping high\nly ef\ufb01cient enzymes that can outperform this competing physical aging process is \nessential [20,21], a challenge addressed through PET hydrolase engineer ing. To this end, \nmany \nstudies investigated the interactions between PET and amino acids near the active \nsite, examining crystal structures of enzymes with PET analogs [6,35\u201341], as well as structures \nbased o\nn molecular docking [5,40,42\u201344], often followed by short MD simulations [6,45\u201349]. \nStu\ndies have replaced sterically demanding amino acids with smaller ones to widen the binding \ncleft of PET-degrading enzymes, enhancing activity due to improved accessibility [43,50\u201352]. \nHowever, \nsuch substitutions might lead to the loss of speci\ufb01c interactions with PET, weakening \nbinding. In fact, in one study, narrowing the binding site and introducing amino acids with \nstronger PET interactions has led to increased activity [49]. Increased aromaticity [50] and hy-\ndrophobicity \n[52,53] near the active site also positively in\ufb02uence activity. A conserved trypto-\nphan, \nknown as \u2018wobbling \u2019 tryptophan, located at one end of the catalytic binding cleft, \nenhances PET binding through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with the benzene ring and improves product \nrelease [40,54]. \nTo \ngain insights into the mechanistic details of the catalytic reaction beyond the assumptions de-\nrived from crysta\nl structures, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simula-\ntions were conducted, with the \ufb01rst studies on enzymatic PET hydrolysis published in 2021 \n[55\u201357], followed by several other studies in subsequent years [58\u201361]. The mechanism consists \nof acylation, \nwhere the catalytic serine\u2019s nucleophilicity is increased by proton transfer from the \nhistidine, allowing for an attack on the PET ester\u2019s carbonyl and the subsequent cleavage of \nthe bond, and deacylation, where a water molecule attacks the acyl intermediate. Key mutations, \nsuch as the replacement of an isoleucine near the catalytic aspartate with alanine, resulted in a \nloss of activity, emphasizing the importance of nearby amino acids in stabilizing the catalytic as-\npartate [62]. A recent QM/MM study disclosed that the acylation process in LCC and PES-H1, \nalong with their \nmore active mutants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , involves two distinct conformations \nof the PET benzene ring that enhance \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with the \u2018wobbling\u2019 tryptophan residue \n[63]. For the high-activity variants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , a reduction of 2\u20135 kcal/mol in activa-\ntion free energy was observed compared with their respective WT enzyme and partially explains \ntheir increased activity. Alternative to molecular simulations, AI also offers promising avenues for \noptimizing the active sites of PET hydrolases; for example, a recent study utilized a diffusion \nmodel combined with a neural network approach to design tailor-made enzymes, speci\ufb01cally \ngenerating novel serine hydrolases for the hydrolysis of PET [64]. \nAttempts were also made to increase enzymatic ef\ufb01ciency by addressing the \ufb01rst step of the cat-\nalytic cycle and \nmodifying the interactions between PET hydrolases and the PET material. How-\never, the collective \ufb01ndings from studies addressing these interactions indicate that this process \nis primarily nonspeci\ufb01c, which poses a challenge for enhancing enzymatic ef\ufb01ciency. In light of \nthis, no explicit PET recognition site has been identi\ufb01ed so far, prompting efforts to modify PET \nsurface characteristics or fuse enzymes with binding domains to enhance adsorption [65]. For\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8709\n(Tm) \n(Xc) \nexample, carbohydrate-binding domains (CBMs), known for ef\ufb01ciently binding polymers like \nsynthetic plastics [66,67], have been fused terminally with PET-degrading enzymes [68\u201373]. \nThes\ne studies demonstrated that the impact of CBM fusion on activity depends on various pa-\nrameters such as the catalytic domain, linker type, substrate type, and substrate load. The fusion \nof small anchor peptides to HotPETase has yielded similar results as with CBMs [14]. Additionally, \nfusing \nhydrophobins or adding them as free molecules enhances PET degradation by PET hydro-\nlases [74\u201376]. Hydrophobins are small glycoproteins that modify the surface properties of hydro-\nphobic \nsubstrates like PET, increasing their hydrophilicity and facilitating enzyme adsorption from \nthe aqueous phase. This improved binding raises the local concentration of the enzyme on the \nsubstrate surface, enhances wettability, and promotes hydrolytic breakdown of PET [74\u201378]. \nAn innova\ntive approach for PET degradation involved codisplaying IsPETase and a hydrophobin \non yeast, signi\ufb01cantly increasing the degradation of highly crystalline PET compared with puri\ufb01ed \nIsPETase [79]. Surfactants serve a similar function as hydrophobins, with their hydrophobic part \nbinding \nto PET, while the charged part mediates contact with the enzyme, as demonstrated for \nIsPETase [80] and TfC2 [81]. \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nTable 1.

For instance, Sagong \net al. identi\ufb01ed a positive effect by introducing negative charges in surface regions away from the \ncatalytic center, while substitutions with negatively charged amino acids near the catalytic center \nresulted in reduced activity [82]. J\u00e4ckering et al. found that even substitutions involving only polar \nresidu\nes, rather than charged ones, on the protein surface far from the active site of PES-H1 sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduced its activity [8]. Thomsen et al. observed crater formation on the PET surface \nd\nuring its degradation with PES-H1, attributing this to PES-H1\u2019s l o w a f\ufb01nity for PET with high\n710 Trends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8\nT [\nKm [ invKm kcat [\u03bc[ \ncrystallinity in combination with the enzyme\u2019s negative surface charge [83]. As degradation in-\ncr\neases the number of negatively charged carboxylic groups on the PET surface, it becomes \nmore negative, repelling PES-H1 and resulting in crater formation rather than uniform degrada-\ntion. These observations are supported by different studies that indicated a positive impact of a \nmore neutral, hydrophobic enzyme surface on enzymatic activity [84\u201386]. However, enhancing \nPET \nadsorption does not always translate to increased PET hydrolase activity; in fact, improved \nactivity can sometimes be achieved by reducing adsorption, as seen in LCC, where a decreased \nbinding af\ufb01nity arises from cationic surfactants [9]. This observation aligns with the Sabatier prin-\nciple\n, which posits that there is an optimal binding af\ufb01nity for achieving the most effective enzy-\nmatic activity. If the binding is too strong, it can hinder the release of the reactants after catalysis \ntook place, reducing the catalytic turnover; conversely, if the binding is too weak, the catalyst may \nnot hold the reactants long enough for the reaction to occur. Thus, an intermediate binding \nstrength is ideal, as it maximizes catalytic ef\ufb01ciency by enabling enzymes to stabilize transition \nstates without obstructing product release [87].\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\nTrendsTrends inin BiochemicalBiochemical Sciences Sciences \nFigure 1.

This study started with an in vitro analysis of eight CBMs for their PET binding af\ufb01nity. A \nfast \nand reliable PET surface af\ufb01nity assay was developed for semi-quantitative analysis of \nprotein\u2013PET interactions, which identi\ufb01ed a Bacillus anthracis CBM from family 2 (BaCBM2) as \na h i g h - a f\ufb01nity PET binder.

The balance of hydrophobic to polar interactions at the CBM\u2013 \nPET interface differentiated high-af\ufb01nity binders, with BaCBM2 demonstrating an optimal ratio, \nfrom CBMs with lower af\ufb01nity [66]. \nConcluding remarks \nThe remarkable similarity between man-made plastics and natural polymers allows certain en-\nzymes, such as cutinases and other polyesterases, to effectively degrade plastics like PET. How-\never, the WT forms of these enzymes often lack the ef\ufb01ciency required for practical industrial \napplications. To rationally enhance their performance, a thorough understanding of the heteroge-\nneous catalytic process is essential, beginning with the adsorption of enzymes onto insoluble PET \nand culminating in product release. While many studies concentrate on elucidating the processes \nwithin the active sites of PET hydrolases, we advocate for increased research into the interactions \nbetween these enzymes and the PET material, both at the onset of degradation and during the \nprocess, particularly as PET undergoes structural and physicochemical changes due to short-\nened chains. As highlighted in this review, a diverse array of experimental and simulation tech-\nniques is available to advance our understanding in this area. We encourage the integration of \nthese methods to achieve a more comprehensive analysis. Ultimately, by gaining deeper insights \ninto the surface processes involved in PET degradation, we can strategically modify PET hydro-\nlase surfaces to achieve the optimal binding conditions described by the Sabatier principle, \nthereby enhancing their catalytic ef\ufb01ciency and paving the way for effective solutions in plastic \nwaste management (see Outstanding questions). \nOutstanding questions \nMechanisms of action:\n\u2022 What are the precise molecular \nmechan\nisms through which PET hy-\ndrolases interact with and degrade \nPET?\n\u2022 How does the surface morphology \nin\ufb02uence these mechanisms? \nEnzyme adsorption:\n\u2022 Why has the adsorption of PET hy-\ndro\nlases to PET surfaces received \nless attention?\n\u2022 What speci\ufb01c factors determine the \nef\ufb01ciency of this adsorption and its \nimplications for enzyme activity? \nEngineering strategies:\n\u2022 What are the most effective strat-\negies \nfor enhancing the catalytic \nef\ufb01ciency of PET hydrolases?\n\u2022 How can a better understanding \nof the interactions between PET \nmaterial and PET hydrolases in-\nform targeted engineering? \nHow can we encourage the field to \nintegrate different simulation and \nexperimental methods to achieve \na more comprehensive approach \nto the study and design of PET \nhydrolases?\nTrends in Biochemical Sciences, August 2025, Vol. 50, No. 8717\n\u03c0\n\u03bc(Kd 25 4 \nTrends in Biochemical Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS"
