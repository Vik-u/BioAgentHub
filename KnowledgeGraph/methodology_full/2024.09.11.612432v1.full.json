To properly capture different conformations with respect to the crystal\nstructure and not merely internal orientations of the loop, we aligned all simulation frames to\nthe crystal structure using the C-alpha carbons of all residues except for 88 to 91. Following\nthis alignment, we computed the RMSD for the backbone of residues 88 to 91 without\nadditional realignment. We then generated a probabilitydensitydistributionbycombiningdata\nfrom all replicates.

Our results show that Fast_2.9 has higher\nactivities thanFastPETaseat30-50 \u2103(Fig.4a,4b) andindifferentpH(SupplementaryFig.9),\nalso outperforming LCCICCG in temperature ranges 30-50\u2103(Fig. 4b), and thus aligning well\nwith the thermal properties of PET and making overall favourable process economy in\nmesophilictemperatures.\nInverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis of the three enzymes with 12 g/L postconsumer\nPET plastics showed that Fast_2.9 has the lowestInvKm, which could be attributed to the\nsubstrate binding cleft stabilisation by S269T for better substrate binding(Fig.3).LowerInvKm\nmeans lower enzyme usage, lowering costs of enzymaticcatalysis,whereasthelowaffinityof\nLCCICCG, as previously suggested,could potentiallylimititswideindustrial adoption75.Assuch,\nwe showed that as little 0.72 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131ofFast_2.9isneededfor nearly100%conversion\ninto TPA of multiple postconsumer PET (both transparent and coloured opaque products)\nwithin just 48hours,which is28%lessenzymeamountthantheoptimised 1mg enzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131for\nLCCICCG 56 and 64% less than the recently reported 2 mgenzyme\u30fbgPET\n\u20131 for TurboPETase14.\nMinimising enzyme usage in this process plays a critical role in enhancing the transformation\nof PET waste into high-value products, thereby contributing to the overall valueenhancement\nof this recycling pathway. High conversion rate from raw PET to TPA rather than MHET is\nneeded to achieve the circular biorecycling and is preferable to be done by a single enzyme.\nHere we showed the potential of Fast_2.9 acting as MHETase76 and achieved 95.9% TPA\ncontent in the total monomers. Similar function has been observed in the variant\nIsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A 77,however theexactcontentvaluewasnotreported. Furthermore,in all\nour experiments except for textile degradation, we used post-consumer PET from\ncustomer-used bottles and containers directly, without any pre-treatments such as heating,\ngrinding 18, acid and base treatments 7879, which underscores the application potential of\nFast_2.9. In this study, secondhand polyester textiles were the only material subjected to\npretreatment. These textiles typically exhibit higher crystallinity and contain more additives\ncompared to food-grade bottles or containers. Initial attempts to directly degrade the raw\ntextile using Fast_2.9 showed limited efficiency (datanotshown).However,byincorporatinga\npretreatment step followed by enzymatic degradation at 50\u00b0C, we demonstrated the\neffectiveness of Fast_2.9 in recycling textile waste. This method achieved over 77%\ndepolymerization and 74.4-90% end-to-end TPA production, highlighting its potential for\nsustainabletextilewastemanagement.\nThe resulting high activity, low substrate-enzyme ratio of Fast_2.9 and effectiveness at mild\n30-50\u2103 temperatures makes it a suitable candidate for industrial PET depolymerisation. In\nPET enzymatic processing, a higher concentration of TPA is advantageous because an\nadditional hydrolysis step is normally needed to completely convert MHET into TPA either by\nenzymatic 80 or chemical hydrolysis18. TPA can be used as a fundamental building block for\nsynthesising recycled virgin-like PET4 as well as for upscaled novel applications7,81.

      "text": "Engineering the strain for sensing TPA and secreting PETases\nWe started by engineering the E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain carrying a transcriptional factor\n(TF)-based TPA biosensor 36 (Supplementary Table 1) that would convert the PET\ndepolymerisation catalytic efficiency into a fluorescence signal for subsequent screening(Fig.\n1a). To warrant the stable expression of the biosensor37, instead of using plasmids, we\nintegrated the TPA biosensor into eight genomic loci using CRISPR-based multicopy\nchromosomal integration approach 38 (Fig. 1b). After three rounds of transformation, the\nbiosensor was combinatorially integrated into four genomic locations resulting in six\ncombinations ranging from a single copy (locus 2 and 4) up to four copies integrated intoloci\n2, 4, 5, 6 (loci 2456 strain) (Methods, SupplementaryTable 2).Toensurethatthebiosensor is\nresponsive to our defined dynamic range of TPA concentrations, all sixstrainsweretestedby\nsubmerging them to TPA concentrations of 0, 1 and 5 mM, with the intention to detect even\nminor substrate concentration differences (Fig. 1c). The loci 45 strain showed the most\nsignificant sensitivity capable of distinguishing 1 mMand5mMconcentrations(Welch'st-test,\np-value<2.2e-16).\nTo corroborate whether theIsPETase enzyme was secreted and active in those strains, we\ntransformed eachstrainwith theplasmid-basedT7-inducible IsPETase containingaN-terminal\nsecretion signal peptide (Supplementary Table3).In the strainswhereeither locus2or 6was\ntargeted, no catalytic activity towards either PET or \u03c1-nitrophenyl acetate (a substrate for\nesterase activity) was 39 observed in the cell lysate or supernatant (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nThis effectwasindependentoftheuse ofexpressionmediums(wetestedIPTG-supplemented\ninduction and autoinduction mediums) (Supplementary Fig. 2).

We first investigated the\nimpact of nanoparticlepreparationonPETsubstrate crystallinity 40,crucial for catalyticrates41,\nby employing two methods in the Non-Solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) process\nusing hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)42 and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)43 assolvents(Methods).\nWe found that the PET nanoparticles obtained with TFA (PET-NP-TFA) method showed over\ndouble increased crystallinity as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (from 3.8% to\n10.3%), while the PET-NP prepared with HFIP (PET-NP-HFIP) has had only 10% crystallinity\nincrease (from 3.8% to 4.2%) comparing to the starting material (GoodFellow PET film,\nMethods). FT-IR analysis 44 also confirmed that the PET-NP-TFA has a higher crystalline\nconformation ratio with 52.5% increase of A1340/A1372 ratio and 20.0% decrease of\nA1475/A1457 ratio (1457 and 1373 cm\u22121 have been associated withthegauche conformation\nof PET, while 1475 and 1340 cm\u22121 increase in intensity during crystallisation due totrans)\n(Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4).

Single cells from IsPETase random\nmutagenesis library (~2 x 106 clones) were encapsulated with PET NP within water-in-oil\nemulsions46 (Fig. 2b top). After 48 hours of droplets cultivation off chip, we observed cells\ngrown together with PET-NP substrate exhibiting green fluorescence compared to negative\ncontrol (Fig. 2b). We then de-emulsified the droplets and subsequently sorted cells using a\nfluorescent cell sorter. Initially, 77.1% of the cells were selected basedonsizeand complexity\ncriteria to exclude oversized or abnormal cells (Fig. 2c).

Figure 2a was created using BioRender.com.\nIn total 192 variants were sorted out onto the LB agar and, of which 167 (86.9%) grew\nsuccessfully on the sorting plate. Of these, 34 (20.3%) displayed greater catalytic efficiency\nthan wildtype (Fig. 2e). We selected the top 12 of these 34 variants for sequencing\n(Supplementary Table 2) and further analysis. These 12 variantswerepurifiedandretestedto\nconfirmthattheir increased activitywasdue tohigher catalyticefficiencyandnotmerelydueto\nelevated expression or secretion. Out of these, 6 variants showed significantly enhanced\ncatalytic activities, with variant M2.9 (S269T) displaying the highestactivityresultingin 22fold\nincrease over WTIsPETase variant (Fig. 2f). Variants M2.3 and M2.8, exhibited enhanced\nactivity compared to the wild type in the supernatant assay. Yet, when purified, their activities\nwere below that of theIsPETase wild type, likely due to the expression efficiency changes\ncausedbythemutations 35,36,47\u201349.\nTo evaluate the catalyticefficiencyofM2.9webenchmarkeditagainstFastPETase 18,whichis\nknown for its high efficiency among all IsPETase variants. 200 nM of FastPETase,IsPETase\nand M2.9 were mixed with 19.2 g/L PET nanoparticles at 30, 40, 50 and 60\u2103for 48 h (Fig.\n2g). M2.9 showed the highest activity at 30 and 40\u00b0C, producing 29.0\u00b10.526mMand22.7\u00b1\n1.23 mM monomers, respectively. This represented increases of 20% and 13% over\nFastPETase, and 54% and 130% overIsPETase. A decrease in catalyticefficiencyfrom30to\n60\u00b0C was noted for all enzymes, withIsPETase and M2.9 displayingfaster declinesat50 and\n60\u00b0C compared to FastPETase, indicating that M2.9 is better suitedfor mesophilicconditions.\nAdditionally, we tested M2.9\u2019s activity on PET film from non-pretreated lids of postconsumer\nyoghurt containers (Supplementary Table 4).
