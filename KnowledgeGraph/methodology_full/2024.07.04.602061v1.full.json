The final yields of all the enzymes were \naround 16 mg/liter of bacterial culture . Wild type LCC, a naturally occurring PETase , has a Tm of 84.7 \u00b0C. \nThis enzyme has been previously engineered by Tournier et al. ,15 leading to the LCC-ICCG variant with a \nreported Tm of 94.0\u00b0C (92.9 \u00b0C in our own assessment, a difference that could be attributed to that fact \nthat, for Tm measurements, Tournier et al. used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), whereas we used \ncircular dichroism (CD) ). After our enzyme design campaign, we tested the thermal stability of the six \nengineered designs (Table 3) and we found that the C09 (Tm = 97.0 \u00b0C) and X05 (Tm = 96.2 \u00b0C) variants have \na higher Tm than the reference LCC-ICCG (Tm = 92.9 \u00b0C). The X09 (Tm = 92.3 \u00b0C) variant showed a limited \nimprovement in the thermal stability, while C08 (Tm = 85.6 \u00b0C) showed a slight decrease in the thermal \nstability (Figure S 2-3). For the P06 and P08 variants, we did not set out to determine the ir melting \ntemperature because of their negligible enzymatic activity (see below). \n \nTable 3. Assessed melting temperature for different PETase s and improvement with respect to the  LCC wild type \nenzyme. The estimation of Tm is sensitive to the experimental setup and conditions, which could explain the difference \nbetween the reported Tm and the Tm determined by us. For proper comparison, we assessed the Tm of LCC-ICCG using \nthe same setup that we used for the measurement of the T m of our engineered enzymes. The melting temperature \nwas not assessed for P06 and P08 (n.d., not detected). \nEnzyme Tm [\u00b0C] Reference \nWT-LCC (reported)  84.7 Tournier et al. 15 \nLCC-ICCG (reported) \nLCC-ICCG (reported) \n94.0 Tournier et al. 15 \n91.7 Arnal et al. 33 \nLCC-ICCG (assessed) 92.9\u00b13.6  \nC09  97.0\u00b11.0  \nX05  96.2\u00b13.7  \nX09  92.3\u00b10.6  \nC08  85.6\u00b16.1  \nP06  n.d.  \nP08  n.d.   \n \nEnzymatic activity \nTerephthalic acid (TPA) is one of the major degradation product s of the activity of the enzymes on PET. \nThis compound can be detected by liquid chromatography (HPLC), which allows a precise quantification \nof product formation. To assess enzymatic activity, s amples were harvested at multiple time points and \nanalyzed by HPLC for the quantification of TPA production (Figure S8). Minor degradation products (MHET \nand BHET) were also assessed (Figure S9-S10). We used an enzyme concentration of 40 nM and a PET film \nof 8.4 mg in a 2 ml microplate tube to evaluate the PET degradation activity of the different mutants. The \nenzyme concentration corresponds to \u22480.3 mg ENZYME/gPET, a ratio lower than the one reported in the \noriginal LCC-ICCG paper (3 mgENZYME/gPET), but in agreement with the range reported in the literature (0.2 \nto 3 mgENZYME/gPET).17,21,32,33 The experiments were done at 68\u00b0C, the temperature at which PET degradation \nis typically carried out in bioreactors at industrial scale to work below the glass transition temperature of \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

If we exclude the first few hours, where ICCG performs better, at 68\u00b0C the mean TPA \nconcentration at the different time points is significantly higher for the C09 mutant than for ICCG up until \nday 6 (144h, Figure 2A and S5-S8). Moreover, the specific activity of C09 is also significantly higher (\u22482-\nfold) than that of the gold standard LCC-ICCG over the same length of time (Figure 2B). All other enzymes \nshow similar or weaker performances compared to LCC-ICCG (X09, C08, X05). At 68\u00b0C, complete sample \ndegradation could be observed with C09 already at day 4  (data not shown), a feature not seen with any \nof the other enzymes, including LCC-ICCG. The % of weight loss after 6 days of reactions for all the enzymes \nis shown in Figure 2C and in S11. To assess the stability and the activity of the enzymes in harsh conditions, \nwe also carried out the same experiments at 80  \u00b0C for 6 days. Also at this temperature, the mean TPA \nconcentration for the C09 mutant is higher than LCC-ICCG at all the time points  (Fig. 2D, S5-S8), albeit \nbeing greatly reduced in absolute terms compared to the reaction at 68 \u00b0C. For the P06 and P08 variants \nwe observed negligible activity (data not shown).  \n \n \nFigure 2. Comparison of PET-depolymerization over time for all enzymes.

The position and \norientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242, and S265) overlaps perfectly with the catalytic triad in the \nparent enzymes (Figure 3A). Although we observe that increased stability leads to higher enzymatic \nactivity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is elusive. We hypothesize that the increase in \nstability provided by the additional surface charges in the C09 variant may help to keep the surface -\nexposed catalytic site in place even at high temperatures , such as those used to test the activity  of the \nenzyme (68\u00b0C). Indeed, all the mutations introduced in the design process are found mostly on the surface \nof the enzyme and away from the catalytic triad (Figure 3B), and are thus unlikely to affect the activity \ndirectly. Rather, the mutations may reduce the proportion of the enzyme that may denature over time, \nand/or prevent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The denaturation (and the consequent loss of \nactivity) is expected to be negligible only for T << T m. Therefore, by increasing the T m to 98\u00b0C the \ndenaturation effects may be significantly reduced at the working temperature (68\u00b0C), explaining the gains \nin activity of the C09 design. The stabilization of the catalytic triad is confirmed by MD simulations, which \nshow that at increasing temperatures C09  features a lower RMSF, in particular near the key catalytic \nresidue H242 (Figure 3C). \n \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In both enzymes, the catalytic site is \ncentered on residue S165. The structure of the LCC-ICCG engineered enzyme is available in the Protein \nData Bank (PDB code: 6THS) as the inactivated S165A variant.  \nIn our design strategy we applied protocols used in previous works25\u201327 starting from the LCC-ICCG mutant \nstructure after reverting amino acid 165 from Alanine to the catalytically active Serine. All residues within \na distance of 5 \u00c5 from S165 were excluded from the design and were therefore left unchanged. The design \nwas done using three separate methods, resulting in three different series of variants. \nThe first design strategy (C-series) was performed using the Rosetta Supercharge tool .30 This tool was \nemployed to reengineer the protein surface with amino acids that present a high net charge, which is \nreported to prevent aggregation of partially unfolded states. The design produced 1024 enzyme variants, \nand the best 10 based on the internal score were kept for further ranking. \nIn the second design strategy (P-series) we used the PROSS web server29 to generate 9 different enzyme \ndesigns with improved packing, hydrogen bond networks and salt bridge networks. \nThe third design strategy (X-series) employed the Disulfide-by-Design web server,31 a tool for disulphide \nbond prediction that allows to find pairs of amino acids that can carry cysteine mutations in the correct \norientation to form disulphides. A total of 150 pair mutations were generated and, based on the internal \nscoring system, the best 10 of them were retained for further testing.   \nOverall, our design campaign produced 29 different enzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD \nsimulations, and then ranked according to the method described in previous works .25\u201327 Briefly, we \nsolvated each molecular model with a 15 \u00c5 pad of TIP3P water and we introduced counter ions to \nneutralize the system charge, resulting in a final simulation box of \u2248 30.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass \nrepartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs 39. The systems were subjected to 1,000 energy \nminimization steps and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 300K with \nNAMD software,40 using AMBER19SB force field,41 non-bonded cut-off of 12 \u00c5, rigid bonds and particle -\nmesh Ewald long -range electrostatics.

As a result, the two best structures \nfrom each design series were selected, namely design C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09. \n \nProtein expression and purification \nThe different codon -optimized nucleotide sequences  of the designed PETase mutants were cloned in a \npET26b(+) bacterial expression vector  (Novagen), together with a C -terminal 6His-tag.

Amorphous, 250 \u03bcm -thick PET films (product number \nES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow USA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a \nhole puncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4  mg, were then placed in 2 ml \nmicrocentrifuge tubes.   \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

HPLC analyses were \nperformed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus system equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven and an \nautosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 \u00b5m; \n4.6 \uf0b4 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column temperature was maintained at 40\u00b0C with a flow \nrate of 1 ml/min.  For the mobile phase, 0.1% H 3PO4 (solvent A) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The \nlinear gradient mode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 0 -15 min, 10-40% B; 15-18min, \n40-65% B; 18-20 min, 65% B; 20-23 min, 65-10% B; 23-25 min 10% B. At every time interval, 100 \u03bcL of the \nsample were collected from the reaction vial placed at the set temperature. The 0h\u201372h samples were \ndiluted 21 times (50\u00b5L of the provided sample was transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1 mL of \n10% MeCN + 0.1% H3PO4), whereas, 96h and 144h sampes \u2013 101 times (10\u00b5L of the provided sample was \ntransferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1  mL of 10% MeCN + 0.1% H 3PO4). Detection was \naccomplished via measurement of UV adsorption at 220 nm; 20 \u03bcL of each sample was injected into the \nsystem and the degradation products were quantified against standard calibration curves ranged 0.1, 1.0, \n5.0, 10.0, 50.0 (for TPA and MHET) and 0.09, 0.9, 4.4 and 43.9 (for BHET) \u03bcg/mL. \nProtein crystallization  \nCrystals of the C09 mutant were grown at room temperature using the vapor diffusion method by mixing \na 2\u03bcL drop of a 10mg/mL protein sample with a 2\u03bcL drop of a solution containing 0.1M Sodium citrate \ntribasic dihydrate pH 5.6, 20% v/v 2 -Propanol, 20% w/v Polyethylene glycol 4,000.  Crystals, which  \nappeared after one week, were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant prior \nto X-ray diffraction data collection. \n \nStructure determination and refinement  \nFor the structure of the C09 mutant, the initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using \nPhaser43 and the atomic coordinates of  the crystal structure of a Leaf-branch compost bacterial cutinase \nhomolog (PDB entry 4EB0) as a search model. Refinement was performed by alternating rounds of \nREFMAC544 and manual adjustments in Coot .45 Water molecules were added both manually and \nautomatically using the Coot_refine tool from the CCP4 package.46 The crystallographic table is shown in \nthe SI file in Table S7. \nData availability \nThe final crystallographic coordinates of the crystal structures of the C09 mutant are available in the RCSB \nPDB (accession code: 8CMV)."

      "text": "Despite IsPETase being initially considered a promising enzyme for PET degradation, multiple studies have \nshown that thermophilic PET hydrolases (e.g., LCC), when operating at temperatures above 65\u00b0C, \noutperform mesophilic enzymes in PET biorecycling.34 Since its publication in 2020, the LCC-ICCG variant \nhas been considered the state-of-the-art PETase enzyme. Hence, starting from this variant, we set out to \nengineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal stability and enzymatic activity. The resulting C09 design \nfeatured a significant improvement in term s of thermal stability (Tm=97.0\u00b0C) with respect to the gold \nstandard LCC-ICCG (+4.1\u00b0C). Under optimal reaction conditions (68\u00b0C), the C09 design enzyme hydrolyzed \nlow-crystallinity PET materials  into TPA  with a 2-fold higher efficiency compared to  LCC-ICCG. We \nnicknamed this design \"DRK3\u201d, in light of the introduced mutations (3 Aspartic acids, 3 Arginines, and 3 \nLysines). The DRK3 variant may represent a significant advancement towards PET biorecycling. However, \nfurther work will be needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant conditions. The DRK3 variant could \nalso provide the basis for further rounds of enzyme engineering. \nRecent studies reported in the literature adopted similar approaches to ours , introducing mutations to \nthe LCC-ICCG enzyme to boost its performance and reporting different degrees of success .17,32,35,36 \nHowever, as reported in relevant reviews,37,38 direct comparison of enzymatic performances is challenging \ndue to the numerous variables involved in the experimental settings (PET crystallinity, PET form, PET \nconcentration, enzyme concentration, temperature, salt type and concentration, pH,  etc.). In this light, \nonly a direct comparison with a recognized gold standard in the same experimental conditions can provide \nreliable information. \nAlthough the field of PETase engineering is very dynamic and is providing  highly optimized enzymes, \nseveral issues still need to be thoroughly investigated to improve enzymatic PET degradation.38 One of the \nmajor challenges is related to the economic viability of enzymatic degradation. Another challenge, more \ndirectly related to protein engineering, concerns the acidification of the medium due to the release of \nTPA, which reduces the performance of the PETase enzymes known to date. Hence, possible directions \nfor enzyme engineering research could be directed towards the design of acid-tolerant PETase enzymes."
