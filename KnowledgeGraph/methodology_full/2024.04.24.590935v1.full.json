The Qdot655-labeled PETase was imaged by \ntotal internal re\ufb02ecNon \ufb02uorescence microscopy (TIRFM) using a 4 88 nm laser ( 70 mW or 150 \nmW) on a custom-built microscope (15). Movies began immediately before the enzyme soluNon \nwas added to the \ufb02ow cells. All experiments were performed at 22\u00b0C. The 10:1 enzyme:Qdot raNo \nwas chosen because binding events were quite rare and lower raNos resulted in insu\ufb03cient \nparNcle counts to accurately calculate landing rate and duraNon parameters. \nPETase landing events and binding duraNons on the surface-immobilized PET \ufb01lm were measured \nby Kymograph analysis in ImageJ, as follows.  Image stacks consist of a cube of x-y images at \nsequenNal Nmes, t.  First, the \u201cReslice\u201d command was used to generate mulNple x-t (horizontal) \nslices at varying y (verNcal).  The \u201cOutput spacing\u201d was set to 5 pixels, which corresponds to the \n~300 nm full width at half maximum of the point spread funcNon of our microscope (15).  Next, \nthe \u201cGrouped z projecNon\u201d command was used to compress the mulNple slices along the y axis \ninto a single x-t image (see Fig. 1). From this kymograph, the binding duraNons are measured by \nthe length of the verNcal lines, where one pixel equals one frame, and the landing rate is \nmeasured by counNng the total number of events throughout the enNre movie. This approach of \ngeneraNng an  x-t Kymograph is similar in principle  to the approach of Pepersson et al  (21).  \nBinding duraNon distribuNons were \ufb01t to biexponenNals in Python 3.9.19 using the \u2018scipy.opNmize\u2019 \nlibrary. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank members of the Hancock lab for helpful suggesNons and Dr. JusNn Brown for \nadvice in PET preparaNon.

The \n5 frames/s video consists of a stack of x-y images through Nme.

Using 70 mW laser power, Qdots were observed \nto reversibly bind to the surface, and the binding duraNons followed a biexponenNal with a fast \nphase of 1.5 \u00b1 0.08 s (faster than the PETase fast phase of 2.7 s) and a slow phase of 51.1 \u00b1 2.0 s \n(Fig. 2A) . We hypothesized that the slow Nme constant may be due to nonspeci\ufb01c and/or \nirreversible binding of Qdots  to the surface, with the apparent unbinding rate being due to \nphotobleaching or blinking of the Qdots.  I f this were the case, then  increasing laser power to \naccelerate bleaching should shorten the Nme constant of the slow phase. To test this, we repeated \nthe control Qdot experiment using a 150 mW laser illuminaNon  and found that the slow Nme \nconstant shortened from 51.1 s to 23.3 s, as expected, while the fast Nme constant remained at \n1.5 s (Fig. 2B).  This result is consistent with the slow phase being due to irreversible binding \nevents whose duraNons are truncated by photobleaching or blinking, rather than dissociaNon.  \nTo further validate our photobleaching hypothesis, we immobilized Qdots  on the surface and \nquanN\ufb01ed their populaNon-level photobleaching rate. To do this, we \ufb02owed 50 pM Qdots (lacking \nPETase) into the \ufb02ow cell without \ufb01rst blocking the PET surface to prevent nonspeci\ufb01c adsorpNon, \nwashed away any free Qdots that did  not bind, and imaged these nonspeci\ufb01cally-bound Qdots \nunder conNnuous laser illuminaNon. T he average \ufb02uorescence intensity of the image  fell \nexponenNally over Nme due to photobleaching of the immobilized Qdots (Fig. 2C). At 70 mW laser \npower, the Nme constant was 118 s, and at 150 mW laser power, the Nme constant fell to 76.3 s, \nconsistent with faster Qdot photobleaching at higher laser powers. This populaNon-level result \nreinforced our single-molecule result in Fig. 2AB, supporNng our conclusion that the slow Nme \nconstant in the PETase experiments (Fig. 1) is due to slow photobleaching of Qdots that are \nnonspeci\ufb01cally bound to the surface. \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Comparing the fast \nphases, which correspond to reversible binding, the hyperacNve mutant had a Nme constant of  \n4.0 \u00b1 0.07 s (\ufb01t \u00b1 SE of the \ufb01t) , longer than the wild -type (2.7 \u00b1 0.12 s), whereas the impaired \nvariant had a Nme constant of 1.7 \u00b1 0.18 s, shorter than wild -type (Fig. 3A -C). These binding \nduraNons are consistent with the hyperacNve mutant having a higher PET binding a\ufb03nity, and the \nimpaired mutant having a lower binding a\ufb03nity than wild-type.   \nTo quanNfy the relaNve on-rates for PET binding, we quanN\ufb01ed the binding frequency of the three \nPETase enzymes along with the Qdot control  (Fig. 3D) . Binding rates were normalized to the \nenzyme concentraNon and to the area of the microscope image. The binding rate of the impaired \nmutant, 1014 \u00b1 282 \u03bcm-2 \u00b7 s-1 \u00b7 M-1 (mean \u00b1 SEM for N=7 movies) was similar to the wild-type rate \nof 1070 \u00b1 310 \u03bcm-2 \u00b7 s-1 \u00b7 M-1 (N = 9).  Notably, the hyperacNve mutant landed more frequently, at \n2141 \u00b1 254 \u03bcm-2 \u00b7 s-1 \u00b7 M-1 (N = 7) than wild-type.  Taken together, the results suggest that the \nhyperacNve mutant achieves a higher PET binding a\ufb03nity through both a faster on -rate and a \nslower o\ufb00-rate.  Finally , the landing rate for  the Qdot control lacking PETase was 394 \u00b1 113 / \n\u03bcm2 \u00b7 s \u00b7 M (N = 11), roughly 1/3 of wild-type PETase (Fig. 3D, dashed line). This nonspeci\ufb01c Qdot-\nPET interacNon in the absence of enzyme means that the observed landing rates of the three \nenzymes are somewhat overesNmated; it follows that the measured enhancement of the landing \nrate of the hyperacNve mutant is a lower limit of the e\ufb00ect.

Thus, we repeated the single-molecule binding experiments \nin the presence of 4 mM pNPA. \npNPA reduced the binding duraNon of wild -type PETase and the hyperacNve variant, but  had \nnegligible e\ufb00ect on the binding duraNons of the impaired mutant and the control Qdots lacking \nbound PETase (Fig. 4A). The clear e\ufb00ects of pNPA on the wild-type and hyperacNve PETase provide \nfurther validaNon that the fast binding duraNon s are reporNng producNve interacNons of the \nenzymes with the immobilized PET.  In contrast, t he \ufb01nding that the binding duraNon of the \nimpaired mutant did not change in the presence of pNPA calls into quesNon whether this mutant \nis speci\ufb01cally binding to the immobilized PET at all under our condiNons.  \nThe impacts of pNPA on the landing rate mirrors the e\ufb00ects on the binding duraNon.  Speci\ufb01cally, \npNPA strongly diminished the landing rate of the wild -type and hyperacNve mutant, whereas it \nhad a negligible e\ufb00ect on the landing rate of the impaired mutant and the Qdot control (Fig. 4B). \nTo beper separate out contribuNons to the landing rate from speci\ufb01c binding versus nonspeci\ufb01c \nbinding, we \ufb01rst quanN\ufb01ed the relaNve amplitudes of the fast and slow phases from the \nbiexponNal \ufb01ts (Fig. 4C). For wild -type and the hyperacNve mutant, the amplitudes of the fast \nduraNons were diminished by  pNPA, consistent with the inhibitor blocking the speci\ufb01c (fast) \ninteracNons. As expected, the relaNve amplitudes of the i mpaired mutant and the Qdot control \nwere una\ufb00ected by pNPA. In the \ufb01nal analysis in Fig. 4D, we mulNplied the overall landing ra te \nfrom Fig. 4B by the relaNve amplitude of the fast phase from Fig. 4C. This corrected landing rate \ncorresponds to the degree to which the pNPA inhibitor blocks funcNonal binding of the PETases \nto the immobilized PET.  In summary, the pNPA results argue that both wild-type and hyperacNve \nmutant PETase bind speci\ufb01cally and reversibly to the PET, with hyperacNve mutant having a faster \nrelaNve on-rate.   \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Due to auto\ufb02uorescence of \nthe PET sample, labeling the PETases with standard \ufb02uorophores such as rhodamine resulted in \nan insu\ufb03cient signal-to-noise for reliable detecNon. Instead, we turned to Qdots, which gave a \nvery good signal-to-noise, but su\ufb00ered from non -speci\ufb01c binding to the PET. We explored using \nsurfactants to reduce nonspeci\ufb01c bin ding but were unable to \ufb01nd condiNons that eliminated \nnonspeci\ufb01c binding while retaining speci\ufb01c binding.  Thus, we carried out a series of control \nexperiments to determine source of the fast and slow Nme constants we idenN\ufb01ed in our \nbiexponenNal dwell Nmes \ufb01ts. \nBy characterizing Qdots  lacking bound PETase and varying laser intensity to characterize \nphotobleaching, we concluded that the slow Nme constant (~tens of seconds) of our \nbiexponenNal \ufb01t to the dwell Nme distribuNons was due to nonspeci\ufb01c binding. The Qdot control \nlacking any bound enzymes had a residual binding interacNon with a dwell Nme of 1.9 \u00b1 0.12 s, \nbut the landing frequency was substanNally lower than Qdots containing a bound PETase (Fig. 3C \nand D).  This lower landing rate and the elevated binding duraNons of t he wild-type PETase and \nthe hyperacNve mutant  were the \ufb01rst indicaNon that the assays were detecNng speci\ufb01c PET -\nPETase interacNons. The strongest evidence that the fast binding populaNon was indeed speci\ufb01c \nbinding of the PETase to the immobilized PET was the fact that in the presence of the inhibitor \npNPA, both the dwell Nmes and the landing rate s of the wild -type PETase and the hyperacNve \n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The most important experimental result was that the \nmean dwell Nme of wild-type PETase was 2.7 s, the dwell Nme of the hyperacNve S238F/W159H \nmutant was 4.0 s, and the dwell Nme of the impaired W185A mutant was 1.7 s, which was similar \nto control Qdots. \nWhat can single -molecule imaging of enzymes tell  us about the ir kineNc parameters? The \nMichaelis-Menten framework consists of a reversible binding step , with rates kon and ko\ufb00, and a \ncatalyNc step, kcat.   \n \nThe standard assumpNon is that product unbinding is fast relaNve to the catalyNc step and is thus \nlumped into kcat. For single-molecule visualizaNon of enzymes binding to an insoluble substrate, \nwe are visualizing the ES complex (meaning the clock starts when the \ufb02uorescent enzyme binds \nto the surface) .  What we measure is dissociaNon from the surface, which is described by the  \napparent dissociaNon rate, \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%. = \ud835\udc58\"## + \ud835\udc58'$(. If we assume that the fast binding duraNons we \nmeasure are re\ufb02ecNng the residence Nme of the enzyme on the PET substrate, then this apparent \no\ufb00-rate can be calculated from our binding duraNons as \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%. =\n)\n*!\"#$\n .  From the fast Nme \nconstants in Fig. 3C, \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%.\tare 0.37 s-1 for the wild-type, 0.25 s-1 for the hyperacNve mutant, and \n0.6 s-1 for the impaired mutant.   \nThe \ufb01rst result that comes out of this analysis is that the upper limit for k cat for wild-type PETase \nis 0.37 s-1. This conclusion comes from the fact that dissociaNon of the enzyme from the substrate \nis either through unbinding before catalysis (ko\ufb00) or via a catalyNc event followed by dissociaNon \nfrom the \u201cproduct\u201d (cleaved PET in our case), with rate kcat. It should be noted that the catalyNc \nevent may be considerably faster than this, meaning that the lumped kcat parameter is rate -\nlimited by product release.  However, the funcNonal turnover rate would be the same in this case, \nas would the apparent kcat that we observed.  This slow turnover rate presumably is related to \nthe crystallinity of PET \ufb01lm and the fact that experiments were performed at room temperature. \nPrevious work showed that higher degrees of crystallinity lead to greater resistance of PET to \nenzymaNc hydrolysis (16, 17).

Our kcat of 0.37 s-1 does seem slow; however, published PETase acNviNes to \ndate have generally been characterized by degradaNon of the substrate  (6, 7) rather than the \nactual turnover rate of the enzyme.  Thus, to our knowledge there are no values in the literature \nfor the kcat of PETase on crystalline PET with which to compare our inferred rate. \nThe enzyme dissociaNon rates that we measure also provide insights into how mutaNons alter the \nkineNc parameters of the enzymes.  We interpret our data in the context of the simple Michaelis-\nMenten model showin in Fig. 5. The hyperacNve mutant, S238F/W159H was chosen by AusNn et \nal. because the mutaNons narrowed the acNve cleg of the enzyme to match that of other \ncuNnases (6). Induced \ufb01t docking simulaNons predicted that this double mutant would have much \nhigher a\ufb03nity for PET, though no predicNons were made on how the mutaNons may alter kcat. We \n\ufb01nd that \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%.\tdrops from 0.37 s-1 for the wild-type to 0.25 s-1 for the hyperacNve mutant.  First, \nbecause a faster kcat predicts a faster \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%. (Fig. 5), our data argue that the greater surface erosion \nand decrease in crystallinity seen with this mutant in a previous study (6) do not result from an \nelevated kcat. Instead, the data argue that the rate of reversible binding from the substrate, ko\ufb00, is \nslowed in the hyperacNve mutant. The \ufb01rst e\ufb00ect of slowing ko\ufb00 is a lower KM, which will improve \nperformance at sub-saturaNng substrate concentraNons. The second e\ufb00ect is that for every \nenzyme-substrate encounter, there is a higher probability that the enzyme will hydrolyze the \nsubstrate (with \ud835\udc5d'$($+,-.- =\n/%\"$\n/%\"$0/&!!\n; Fig. 5) rather than simply unbinding without acNng on the \nsubstrate (with probability \ud835\udc5d123.24 =\n/&!!\n/%\"$0/&!!\n).   \nWe can also use this analysis to interpret  the impaired mutant. Previous work suggested that  \nresidue W185 reorients upon producNve binding to PET and may contribute p-stacking \ninteracNons with aromaNc groups in the PET substrate (6).  The W185A mutaNon was found to \nhave reduced surface erosion acNvity on PET and a smaller  reducNon in PET crystallinity , \ncompared to wild -type (6). First, it should be noted that, because we found that  \ud835\udf0f#$-( for the \nimpaired mutant was indisNnguishable from that for Qdots alone (Fig. 3C), the \ud835\udc58\"##\n$%%.\tof 0.6 s-1 for \nthe impaired mutant  should be considered a lower limit .

The simplest interpretaNon of the faster apparent o\ufb00-rate \nis that the o\ufb00-rate of the impaired mutant from the PET substrate is considerably faster than wild-\ntype. This e\ufb00ect makes sense based on the proposed role of W185 in PET binding, and in bulk \nassays would lead to a larger KM.  Another way to describe the mutaNon is that for every binding \nencounter, the proba bility of a catalyNc event, \ud835\udc5d'$($+,-.- =\n/%\"$\n/%\"$0/&!!\n , is smaller, making the \nenzyme less producNve."

This approach provides a new tool that can be combined with exisNng bulk methods \nand computaNonal tools to engineer more acNve and robust PETases that address microplasNcs \npolluNon.  Further development of this single-molecule approach will require reducing the non-\nspeci\ufb01c adsorpNon that complicates interpretaNon of the kineNc data.  PotenNal soluNons include \nusing probes other than Qdots to label the enzymes, improved processing of the PET substrate to \nreduce the auto\ufb02uorescence, and idenNfying surfactants or other alteraNons in bu\ufb00er condiNons \nthat minimize nonspeci\ufb01c binding.  Notably, more acNve enzymes that have higher kcat values are \npredicted to bind for shorter duraNons, and nonspeci\ufb01c Qdot binding currently limits the upper \nlimit of apparent k o\ufb00 values that can be measured. One approach that has been explored for \nimproving PETase funcNon is apaching a  Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM)  or another \nhydrophobic domain to PETases to improve their PET binding a\ufb03niNes (19, 20).
