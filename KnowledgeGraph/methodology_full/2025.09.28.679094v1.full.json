In\n2016, a PET-assimilating bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was isolated from a PET\nrecycling facility. This bacterium secretes a cutinase-like enzyme, IsPETase, that degrades\nPET to mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate (TPA), and ethy-\nlene glycol at ambient temperature. 2 Since then, e\ufb00orts have been devoted to engineering\nthis enzyme, resulting in numerous improved variants. 3\u201313\nThe catalytic mechanisms of serine hydrolases, including PETase, have been extensively\nstudied. Con\ufb02icting hypotheses have been proposed with particular disagreement regarding\nproton transfer events during the catalytic cycle. 14\u201318 While QM/MM studies have provided\nvaluable insights, these methods have inherent limitations, such as boundary issues and lim-\nited accuracy in the MM component, and therefore introduce artifacts and produce di\ufb00erent\nresults.19\u201326 Additionally, QM/MM simulations often require a large QM region for converged\nresults, which is computationally expensive. 27\nMachine learning force \ufb01elds (MLFFs) provide a promising alternative by mapping chem-\nical descriptors to the quantum mechanical energy of systems, 28 combining the e\ufb03ciency of\nclassical force \ufb01elds with the accuracy of QM methods. As deep learning (DL) 29 transforms\ncomputational chemistry, several DL-based MLFFs have been developed for MD simula-\ntions.30\u201333 Previously, we developed QuantaMind, 34 a DL-based MLFF trained on diverse\nbiomolecular fragments with an emphasis on transition-state geometries, shown to be e\ufb00ec-\ntive in simulating reactions in aqueous solutions.\nIn this work, we demonstrate the application of QuantaMind in simulating the complete\ncatalytic cycle of PETase. Our simulations elucidate key proton transfer events that are\nconsistent with previous QM/MM studies. We estimate free energy barriers of 22 and 20\nkcal/mol for the acylation and deacylation steps, respectively, along the lower bound path.\n2\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The term \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\nis approximated by:\n\u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u2248 \u2202U\n\u2202Ri\n\u00b7 Ri \u2212 Rj\nrij\n+ \u2202\nU\n\u2202Rj\n\u00b7 Rj \u2212 Ri\nrij\nThis\napproximation involves the sum of the projections of the unbiased forces on atoms\ni and j onto the vector Ri \u2212 Rj , where Ri and Rj are the 3D coordinates of the respective\natoms. Using multiple frames obtained from QuantaMind MD simulations, we calculate\naverages ( \u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9avg) and standard deviations (\u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9std), approximating the distribution of\n(\u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9) with a Gaussian distribution:\n\u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9 \u223c N (\u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9avg, \u27e8 \u2202U\n\u2202\nrij\n\u27e9std)\nThe Gaussian distributions at each rij are then propagated through numerical integration\nto estimate the distribution of the free energy change Aa\u2192b.\nData Availability\nThe source code used to perform QuantaMind MD simulation is available at https://\ngithub.com/MoleculeMindOpenSource/QuantaMind.
