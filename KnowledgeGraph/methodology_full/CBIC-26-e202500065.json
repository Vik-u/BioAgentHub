Characterization of PETases against PET Film\nAs useful PETases will need to be active on real-world postcon-\nsumer PET, the enzymes were next evaluated for their ability to\ndegrade PET films. Each enzyme (final concentration 1 nM) was\nincubated with amorphous PET film (Goodfellow) for seven\ndays at 65 \u00b0C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl). Every 24 h, an aliquot\nwas removed and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). This same anal-\nysis was also conducted using LCCICCG, although the assay with\nthis protein was conducted over two days, due to the superior\nperformance of this catalyst. Of the novel proteins characterized\nhere, only BelC, OcnT, and TrmN were found to be active against\nPET film, whereas no products of PET hydrolysis were detected\nwith the remaining enzymes. Over the course of this incubation,\nthese three enzymes clearly catalyzed the formation of varying\nlevels of TPA, MHET, and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n(BHET) (Figure 3). BelC and TrmN were found to release MHET\nas the major product during the initial portions of the assay, with\nTPA gradually accumulating over the course of the week\n(Figure 3A,B). This\u201cburst\u201d of MHET production was also observed\nwith LCCICCG, consistent with previous examinations of the prod-\nuct profile associated with this benchmark PETase (Figure S10,\nSupporting Information). Intriguingly, the product profile associ-\nated with the OcnT-catalyzed depolymerization of PET film sug-\ngested that this enzyme releases TPA as the major product over\nthe course of the assay (Figure 3C). Each of these enzymes was\nalso found to produce low and relatively constant concentrations\nof BHET.

The high efficiency\nthat BelC exhibited onpNPB, 3PET emulsions, and PET films may\nprovide some confidence that small molecule mimics of PET can\nserve as useful compounds to enable comparative kinetic analyses\nof PETases. In contrast, OcnT is more stable than BelC, and corre-\nspondingly, OcnT catalyzed the release of only\u22488 \u03bcMo fT P Aa n da\nminiscule amount of MHET under identical conditions (Figure 3C).\nThe quantity of degradants released from the PET film was\nthen used to determine the extent of depolymerization of the\nsubstrate by LCCICCG and the three novel enzymes found to be\nactive against films. Although BelC, TrmN, and OcnT are unam-\nbiguously active against PET film, the week-long treatment with\neach enzyme resulted in only 1.2%/C6 0.2%, 0.44%/C6 0.03%, and\n0.08% /C6 0.01% depolymerization, respectively. While these\nenzymes might serve as useful seed sequences for directed\nevolution campaigns to generate PETases with altered properties,\neach protein is significantly less efficient at depolymerization\nthan engineered LCCICCG. In fact, LCCICCG was shown to achieve\nnearly quantitative depolymerization of postconsumer PET waste\nafter only 24 h under similar conditions.[13] A more direct compar-\nison was facilitated by incubating LCC ICCG with amorphous\nPET film at 65 \u00b0C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris-HCl) for two days. After\nthis shortened assay, LCCICCG had depolymerized 32%/C6 3% of\nthe film substrate, demonstrating the substantial difference\nin efficiencies separating BelC, TrmN, and OcnT from this engi-\nneered PETase.\nSince AroC, TrmA, TrmD, and TrmH were apparently unable to\nhydrolyze PET film, the level of residual activity of each protein\nwas assayed against pNPB following the week-long incubation.\nWhile TrmD was largely inactive following the incubation\nwith the film, the three remaining proteins retained significant\nlevels of hydrolytic activity the 7-day reaction at 65 \u00b0C (Figure\nS9, Supporting Information). The lack of reactivity toward PET film\nby these enzymes may reflect differences in substrate specificity\nas well as access to the PET polymer chain. Both the PET emulsion\nassay and PET film assays were conducted at a temperature\nbelow the Tg of PET. At this temperature, the emulsified PET\nnanoparticles would likely be more accessible to the enzymes\nthan the PET film. In this context, it is notable that the Auclair\nlab has recently demonstrated that the commercial cutinase\nHiC is able to hydrolyze highly crystalline PET under moist-solid\nconditions.[36]\n2.6. Structural Characterization of AroC\nWe also attempted to structurally characterize several of the pro-\nteins described here to better understand their activities and\nthermostabilities. While all proteins were subjected to crystalliza-\ntion screening, conditions could only be identified for the growth\nof high-quality AroC crystals. This protein is not active on PET film\nand is minimally active on PET nanoparticles (Table 4), but the\nenzyme does exhibit a remarkably highTm (85 \u00b0C, Table 1) and\ncatalyzes the hydrolysis of 3PET (Table 3). As such, structural char-\nacterization of AroC was pursued to gain insight into the thermo-\nstability of this protein and, potentially, the stabilities of the\nother hydrolases were described here. Additionally, the experi-\nmentally determined structure of AroC could be compared with\nthe predicted structure of this protein to ensure that AlphaFold2\ncan accurately predict the structures of the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase\nfold-5 subfamily members that could not be crystallized.\nThe structure of AroC was resolved to a resolution of 2.25 \u00c5\n(PDB: 9EH6) (Figure 4). The enzyme crystallized as a homodimer,\nwith each monomer exhibiting the canonical \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase\nFigure 3. Evaluating hydrolytic activity against PET film. Product distributions\nobtained with A) BelC, B) TrmN, and C) OcnT are shown over the course of\none week of reaction with PET film at 65 \u00b0C, pH 8. Data points are as follows:\nTPA (yellow square), MHET (black sphere), BHET (blue triangle), residual\nenzyme activity toward pNPB (green sphere).\nChemBioChem 2025, 26, e202500065 (6 of 11) \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

The structures exhibited an\nRMSD of 1.11 \u00c5 between 93 pruned atom pairs (8.16 \u00c5 across\nall 193 pairs; Figure 4B) and the catalytic triad residues were effec-\ntively coincident (Figure S2A, Supporting Information). However,\nAroC has a distinctive loop (residues G208WYGEQPGDNPATIS222)\nthat folds over the active site (Figure 4B) that is not shared with\nLCC-PETase (Figure S1, Supporting Information).\nAlphaFold2 was then used to predict the structure of AroC, and\nthis prediction was compared to the X-ray crystal structure. The\nalignment of the two structures exhibited a global RMSD of only\n0.672 \u00c5, suggesting that AlphaFold2 accurately predicts the struc-\ntures of\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold-5 subfamily. As such, the structures of\nthe nine other proteins described in this work were predicted\nand aligned with the experimentally derived structure of AroC.\nThis comparison indicated that each protein harbors the distinctive\nloop (G208\u2013S222; AroC numbering) that is absent in LCC-PETase, and a\nmultiple sequence alignment demonstrated significant sequence\nconservation within and immediately preceding this loop:\nF207GxY(G/E)xQx(G/E)DxxxxI(S/T)222 (AroC numbering, Figure S11,\nSupporting Information). While this conservation is intriguing, the\nrole of this loop is not entirely clear: of the 13 first shell active site\nresidues that LCC-PETase is predicted to use to interact with a model\nof a PET trimer,[13] AroC shares 4 identical residues, and 6 others that\nare similar in polarity and size (Figure 4C,D, Figure S1, Supporting\nInformation). F207 of AroC is predicted to make a conserved\n\u03c0-interaction with a terephthalate group, whereas Y210 and H125\nare predicted to replicate H-bonds to ester linkages, and G68, L177,\nY152, and L127 are homologs to residues in LCC-PETase that form\nhydrophobic contacts with the substrate (Figure 4D).\nNext, the predicted structures of BelC, OcnT, TrmA, TrmD,\nTrmH, TrmN, along with the X-ray crystal structure of AroC, were\nused to rationalize the thermostability of the enzymes. The\nnumber of salt bridges present on the surface of each protein\nwas determined and compared to theTm value for each protein\n(Figure 5). In general, theTm of the enzyme correlates well with\nFigure 4. A) The X-ray crystal structure of AroC (PDB: 9EH6) with catalytic triad shown as sticks.

ChemBioChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH\nChemBioChem\nResearch Article\ndoi.org/10.1002/cbic.202500065\nthe number of surface salt bridges on the exterior of the protein,\nwith TrmD and BelC havingTm values higher than expected. This\nis consistent with the finding that salt bridges are more abundant\nin hyper-thermostable proteins. [38] At higher temperatures,\nthe energetic penalty associated with desolvation of charged\nresidues decreases significantly, such that salt bridges are largely\nstabilizing at elevated temperatures.[33] While the observed cor-\nrelation between thermostability and the number of salt bridges\nis not exact, it does implicate these ionic interactions as being at\nleast partially responsible for imbuing the enzymes described\nhere with exceptional thermostabilities.\n3. Conclusion\nIn this study, we made use of SSNs to mine the\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase\nfamily for novel PET-degrading enzymes from thermophilic\norganisms. This approach proved to be highly efficient: out of\nten genes encoding putative thermophilic PETases from \u03b1/\u03b2\nhydrolase_5 subfamily, seven soluble proteins were purified\nand shown to be active toward a trimeric mimic of PET and\nPET nanoparticles, and three of these enzymes were also capable\nof degrading PET film. Given that these proteins were quite dis-\nsimilar to LCC-PETase (%ID = 18\u201322%), results presented here\nalso suggest that PET-active proteins may be more widely distrib-\nuted across the\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase family than previously appreciated.\nEach new PETase described here also exhibited high thermo-\nstabilities, and structural analysis demonstrated a correlation\nbetween the number of surface salt-bridges with observedTm val-\nues. With advancements in the understanding of PETase mech-\nanisms, these naturally thermostable PETase variants can serve as\nscaffolds for directed evolution to engineer variants that are both\nthermostable and catalytically efficient. Overall, this work not only\nexpands our knowledge in enzymatic PET degradation but also\nprovides a template for the discovery of extremozymes for other\napplications.\n4. Experimental Section\nGeneral\nChemicals used to make media and buffers were obtained from\nBioshop. Genes encoding PETases were synthesized into expression\nvectors by BioBasic (Canada). In cases where SignalP 6.0 predicted\nsignal peptides, the corresponding portion of the gene was\nremoved.[39] The genes were codon optimized for expression in\nE. coli a n dc l o n e di n t ot h eN d e Ia n dX h o Is i t e so fp E T - 2 6 b(\u00fe)t o\nencode each enzyme with an C-terminal His6-tag.

Unless otherwise stated, all cultivation\nmedia for E. coli was supplemented with 50 \u03bcgm L/C0 1 kanamycin.\nPlysurf A210G surfactant was obtained from Dr. Sofia Lemak and\nProf. Alexander F. Yakunin (University of Toronto). PET film was\npurchased from GoodFellow, PET nanoparticles were purchased\nfrom Nanochemazone, and Ni2\u00fe Sepharose high-performance resin\nwas purchased from Cytiva.E. coliBL21(DE3) and LOBSTR cells were\nobtained from New England Biosciences and Fisher Scientific,\nrespectively.\nSSN Analysis\nLCC-PETase (accession ID: G9BY57) was analyzed by the InterProScan\nwebtool to assign this e nzyme to the IPR029059 ( \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\nfold-5) family. The Enzyme Function Initiative\u2019sE n z y m eS i m i l a r i t yT o o l\n(EFI-EST)[40] was then used to conduct an all-by-all BLAST for all members\nof this protein family. An alignment score of 45 was used to visualize the\nresulting network in Cytoscape 3.9.1. Sequences contained in this net-\nwork that were from thermophileswere identified using Cytoscape\u2019s\nability to filter nodes on the basis of the name of the host organism.\nProtein Expression and Purification\nPlasmids encoding PETases were transformed into chemically compe-\ntent E. coli cells by heat shock and plated onto lysogeny broth\n(LB)-agar supplemented with 50 \u03bcgm L/C0 1 kanamycin. AroC, TrmA,\nand OcnT were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, while TrmD,\nTrmN, BelC, and TrmH were expressed in E. coli LOBSTR cells.\nFollowing overnight growth, a single colony was picked and used\nto inoculate 10 mL of sterile LB media. The next day, this overnight\nculture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB. The culture was allowed to\ngrow at 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8 was reached.\nAfter incubating the cells on ice for 10 min, expression was then\ninduced by the addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside\nto a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture was then shaken\nat 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm for an additional 3 h before the\ncells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C and 4000 /C2 g for\n10 min. Harvested cells were resuspended in binding buffer\n(20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol\nv/v) and lysed by three passes through an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer\n(Avestin, Ottawa) at 10,000 \u201315,000 psi. Cellular debris was then\nremoved by centrifugation at 16,000/C2 g for 1 hr and the supernatant\nwas loaded onto a Ni2\u00fe-NTA resin that had been preequilibrated with\nbinding buffer. The column was then washed with 10\u201315 column vol-\numes (CVs) of binding buffer followed by elution of the protein of inter-\nest with 3\u20135 CVs of elution buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM\nNaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol v/v). Fractions containing pure\nenzyme were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and concentrated\nusing a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Concentrated samples\nwere buffer exchanged into storage buffer (40 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6,\n100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol v/v) using a PD-10 desalting column\nor a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Protein concentrations were\nmeasured by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients\ncalculated for each protein using the ProtParam tool from Expasy.[41]\nEnzyme Activity Assays withpNPB\nReactions to assay esterase activity were performed in 976\u03bcL5 0 m M\nTris-HCl (pH 8 or 9) equilibrated at 30 \u00b0C. Aliquots of 20\u03bcL pNPB dis-\nsolved in acetone were added to achieve the desired final substrate\nconcentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 4\u03bcL\nconcentrated enzyme, and reaction progress was monitored by\nabsorbance at 405 nm using an Agilent Technologies G9864A spec-\ntrometer. Spontaneous rates of hydrolysis were measured prior to\nadding enzyme and subtracted from the observed enzymatic rate.\nInitial rates were measured at substrate concentrations between\n\u22480.2/C2 and \u22485/C2 the final KM values, where possible. Plots of initial\nrates versus substrate concentration were fit to the Michaelis\nMenten equation using Origin Lab 2024. Values ofkcat were deter-\nmined using calculated enzyme extinction coefficients for enzyme\nconcentrations and \u03b5405 = 18,000 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for p-nitrophenolate.[42]\nTm Measurements of Enzymes\nProtein samples (300\u03bcL of 1 mg mL/C0 1) were loaded into a quartz\ncuvette (Hellma USA Inc., round cylindrical cuvette, 1 mm pathlength)\nChemBioChem 2025, 26, e202500065 (8 of 11) \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Samples were incrementally heated from\n20 to 90 \u00b0C in 2.5 \u00b0C steps. Ellipticity was measured as a function of\ntemperature between 180 and 260 nm. The melting temperature (Tm)\nis the temperature at which the fraction unfolded (Fu) and fraction\nfolded (F) are equal. Fraction unfolded is calculated using the equa-\ntion Fu = (Fo /C0 F)/(Uf /C0 F) whereFo is the ellipticity value at each tem-\nperature, F is the ellipticity value at low temperature, andUf is the\nellipticity value at the highest temperature.\nEnzyme Thermostability Analysis\nAliquots of enzyme at 100\u03bcM in storage buffer (40 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH\n7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol v/v) were placed in a water bath set at\nthe desired temperature for 0 to 24 h. At a given time, an aliquot of\nenzyme was removed, centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 1 min, then placed\non ice. 4\u03bcL of supernatant was then used to initiate the hydrolysis of\n0.5 mMpNPB at 30 \u00b0C in 1 mL 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8. Initial rates were\nmeasured in triplicate with three individual aliquots.\n3PET Synthesis[43]"
