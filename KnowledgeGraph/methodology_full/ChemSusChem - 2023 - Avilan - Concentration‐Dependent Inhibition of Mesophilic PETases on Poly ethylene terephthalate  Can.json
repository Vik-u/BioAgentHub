      "text": "Substrates and products\nBis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA)\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Mono-(2-\nhydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET) was synthesized and sup-\nplied by ChiroBlock GmbH (Germany). Amorphous, 0.25 mm-thick\nPET film sheet was supplied by Goodfellow (product number ES30-\nFM-000145). In preparation for enzyme hydrolysis assays, 10.5 mg\nstadium shaped pieces with dimensions 13 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.25 mm were\nprepared from the PET film sheet using a hole punch. A micronized\namorphous powder was produced from this PET film by cryo-\nmilling, first in a SM300 cutting mill (Retsch), then in a ZM200\ncentrifugal mill (Retsch), as described previously.\n[40]\nAfter air drying,\nthe particle size and shape distributions in the PET powder were\nassessed by dynamic image analysis using a CAMSIZER X2 (Micro-\ntrac MRB) with X-Fall module. Thereafter, an approximation of the\npowder surface area was calculated from the derived distributions\nof particle cross-sectional area and aspect ratio. Quantitative\nanalysis of the PET crystallinity was performed by DSC using a DSC\n214 Polyma (Netzsch) both before and after cryo-milling.\nPlasmid construction\nNucleotide and amino acid sequences, Genbank accession numbers\nand organism sources of the enzymes used in this study are shown\nin the Tables S1\u2013S3. Amino acid sequences with homology to\nIsPETase and belonging to the Type IIa and IIb groups of the PET-\ndegrading enzymes, were retrieved from NCBI database using\nprotein BLAST software. These sequences were codon optimized for\nexpression in E. coli K12 MG1655 (Highly Expressed Genes) using\nthe codon optimizer at http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/ (guided\nrandom method).\n[41]\nThe sequences included the signal peptide\npredicted by Signal 6 software.\n[41]\nThe stop codon was omitted and\noverlaps were added for assembly into the expression vector pET-\n21b(+) such that the assembly would results in the addition of a C-\nterminal 6 His tag. These sequences were synthesized as linear DNA\nfragments by IDT and assembled using NEBuilder\u00ae HiFi DNA\nAssembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions into pET-21b(+) digested with NdeI and\nXhoI. IsPETase\n[2]\nand the double mutant of IsPETase W159H/\nS238F,\n[30]\nhave been described elsewhere. Mutants of Rhizobacter\ngummiphilus cutinase II (RgCut-II) and other mutants of IsPETase\nwere assembled in pET-29. The HotPETase\n[3]\ngene and the IsPETase\nvariant (IsPETase S121E/D186E/R280 A),\n[31]\ncloned in the expression\nplasmid pBbE8 K, was kindly provided by Anthony Green, University\nof Manchester.\nRecombinant expression of enzymes\nEnzyme expression plasmids were transformed into BL21-C41 (DE3)\nE. coli cells (Sigma), with the exception of HotPETase and the\nIsPETase S121E/D186E/R280 A which were expressed in T7-SHuffle\nE. coli cells (NEB). Isolated colonies from the transformation plates\nwere inoculated into antibiotic-containing liquid medium, either a\nnon-inducing minimum medium containing glucose\n[42]\nfor subse-\nquent autoinduction expression, or 2YT medium; these starter\ncultures were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0 C with shaking. The starter\ncultures were used to inoculate multiple 500 mL cultures of either\n2YT broth or ZYM-5052 auto-induction medium\n[42]\n(Table S7) in 2 L\nErlenmeyer flasks (total volume between 2 and 4 L for each\nenzyme); these were then incubated in an Eppendorf shaking\nincubator at 160 rpm at 37 \u00b0 C. For cells grown in 2YT medium, the\nculture was grown to an OD\n600\nof 0.6, induced by adding either\narabinose to 10 mM (for HotPETase and the IsPETase variant S121E/\nD186E/R280 A) or IPTG to 1 mM (all other enzymes), and returned\nto the incubator for 18 h at 20 \u00b0 C. For the auto-inductive expression\nin ZYM-5052, the cells were grown at 28 \u00b0 C for 28 h. In each case,\ncells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet stored at\n\u0000 20 \u00b0 C prior to purification.\nChemSusChem\nResearch Article\ndoi.org/10.1002/cssc.202202277\nChemSusChem 2023, 16, e202202277 (9 of 12) \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 g X 30 min at\n4 \u00b0 C, and the supernatant purified by affinity chromatography at\n4 \u00b0 C on a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with\nlysis buffer. After washing, the enzyme was eluted with a linear\ngradient of 10 to 250 mM imidazole over 120 mL. Fractions\ncontaining the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE and\nconcentrated to 5 mL by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15\n(Sigma) with 10 kDa MW cut-off and loaded at 4 \u00b0 C onto a HiLoad\n16/600 Superdex 200 (Cytiva) size exclusion column that had been\npre-equilibrated with Tris 20 mM pH 8, 0.3 M NaCl. The purity and\nmolecular weight of the eluted proteins were assessed by SDS-\nPAGE with Coomassie staining, and the protein of interest was\nidentified by Western blotting using an anti-His-tag monoclonal\nantibody (Invitrogen), a horseradish peroxidase coupled anti-mouse\nIgG conjugate (Sigma), with visualization using the enhanced\nchemiluminescence method (ECL substrates, GE Healthcare). The\npurified proteins were concentrated and dialyzed in Tris 20 M, pH 8,\n100 mM NaCl using a PD 10 column and stored at \u0000 20 \u00b0 C with 10 %\nglycerol.\nEnzyme differential scanning calorimetry\nFor those enzymes that were purified to a high enough yield, an\napparent melting temperature (T\nm\n) was determined by DSC on a\nMicroCal PEAQ-DSC Automated instrument (Malvern Panalytical).\nPrevious analysis, the samples were submitted to size exclusion\nchromatography in a HiLoad Superdex 75 pg column (Cytiva)\nequilibrated in 50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n/Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 100 mM NaCl pH 7.5. DSC\nanalyses were performed in triplicate using 0.2 mg mL\n\u0000 1\nand the\ntemperature of the sample was raised from 30 \u00b0 C to 120 \u00b0 C at\n1.5 \u00b0 C min\n\u0000 1\n. Buffer subtraction, baseline correction and apparent T\nm\ndetermination were performed using the instrument\u2018s control and\nanalysis software.\nStructure determination and modelling of IsPETase\nhomologues\nThe structures of IsPETase (PDB: 6EQE), double mutant IsPETase\n(W159H/S238F; PDB: 7OSB) and HotPETase (PDB: 7QVH) have been\ndescribed previously. For crystallization of RgCut-II, PsCut and\nPbauzCut, each protein was concentrated to 10 mg mL\n\u0000 1\nand sitting\ndrop crystallization trials were set up using a Honeybee X8 robot\n(Genomic Solutions). Protein crystals appeared in the following\nscreens and conditions: RgCut-II \u2013 Proplex screen (Molecular\nDimensions), G11, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M sodium acetate; PsCut \u2013\nJCSG-plus screen (Molecular Dimensions), B7, 0.1 M sodium acetate\npH 4.6, 8 % PEG 4000; PbauzCut \u2013 JCSG-plus screen (Molecular\nDimensions), A1, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5, 0.2 M lithium sulfate,\n50 % PEG 400. Diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light\nSource (Didcot, UK) and processed using DIALS\n[43,44]\non ISPyB. The\nstructure was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP\n[45]\nusing structure homologs. Model buildings were performed in\nCoot\n[46]\nand the structures were refined with REFMAC5.\n[47]\nMolProbity\n[48]\nwas used to evaluate the final structure models. Data\nand Refinement statistics are summarized in Table S5. The atomic\ncoordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and are\navailable under the accession codes 8AIR, 8AIS and 8AIT.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nwith previous reports.\n[16]\nHere, maximal activity is increased\napproximately 5-fold at pH 8.0 (Figure 1A,C), and 2-fold at\npH 9.0 (Figure 1B,D).\nTo investigate the temporal nature of concentration-\ndependent inhibition, we performed time-courses of IsPETase-\nmediated PET hydrolysis under those conditions where the\nphenomenon is strongest for this enzyme, that is, at pH 9.0 in\nthe absence of DMSO (Figure S2 and Figure 2A,B). Under these\nconditions, significant inhibition of PET turnover activity at high\nenzyme concentration starts to become evident after approx-\nimately 1 h of incubation (Figure S3); the degree of inhibition\nrises above 50 % after 2 h and is sustained at a high level\nthroughout the remainder of the 4-day time-course (Figure 2C).\nDuring this period, the greatest degree of PET hydrolysis is\nwitnessed for 50\u2013100 nm IsPETase, with an enzyme loading of\n2.75\u20135.51 \u03bcg cm\n\u0000 2\n. This enzyme concentration-dependent inhib-\nition is even more pronounced in the fusion of IsMHETase, an\nenzyme that hydrolyses MHET in I. sakaiensis,\n[2]\nand IsPETase.\n[24]\nThis enzyme fusion exhibits 99 \ufffd 0.1 % inhibition at pH 8.0\n(Figure S4). This acute susceptibility of IsPETase to concentra-\ntion-dependent inhibition is evident for the individual aromatic\nproducts TPA and MHET and is stronger at 30 \u00b0 C than 40 \u00b0 C\n(Figure S5). Consistent with an earlier report,\n[2]\nthe inhibition of\nMHET production at high enzyme concentration appears to be\nmore pronounced than for TPA. Although MHETase activity was\ninitially reported to be absent in IsPETase,\n[2]\nit has been\nsubsequently observed during extended incubations.\n[25]\nHere,\nwe measured detectable MHETase activity with 100 nm IsPE-\nTase, albeit at a rate approximately 280-times lower than for\nBHET hydrolysis (Figure S6). Moreover, the MHETase activity\nincreases with the IsPETase concentration, confirming that the\nhydrolysis is enzymatic rather than spontaneous (Figure S6).\nThe marked decline in observed MHET production is thus a\nconsequence of both the inhibition of PET hydrolysis at high\nenzyme concentration and this intrinsic MHETase activity in\nIsPETase.\nInhibition of PET hydrolysis at high IsPETase concentration is\na surface phenomenon\nThe observed concentration-dependent inhibition could poten-\ntially arise from aggregation of the enzyme in solution. To\ninvestigate this possibility, we analyzed the behavior of IsPETase\nin solution by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig-\nure S7). Across all concentrations tested (5 to 50 \u03bcM), IsPETase\neluted as a single, narrow peak without any change in elution\nvolume (and, hence, apparent MW), suggesting a consistent\nmonomeric state. Furthermore, the rate of BHET hydrolysis does\nnot decline at elevated IsPETase concentrations, as would be\nexpected if the enzyme were aggregating in solution (Fig-\nure S8), so we conclude that the concentration-dependent\ninhibition is a surface phenomenon produced when enzyme\nmolecules interact with each other following substrate binding.\nEnzyme concentration-dependent inhibition is dependent on\nsubstrate surface area\nTo gain further insight into inhibition at high enzyme concen-\ntrations in IsPETase, we analyzed the dependence of PET\nhydrolysis activity on substrate surface area by varying the\namorphous PET film solids loading. Iteratively doubling the\nsolids loading from 2.1 wt % to 16.8 wt % (and, hence, iteratively\nhalving the enzyme loading per surface area) resulted in a\nreduction in the inhibition (Figure 3A) with a concomitant\nincrease of the enzyme concentration at which inhibition\noccurs. This shift in inhibitory enzyme concentration is consis-\ntent with the relief of inhibitory enzyme\u2013enzyme interactions at\nthe PET surface as enzyme density falls due to a reduced\nenzyme loading per surface area. In contrast, increasing the\nenzyme concentration in proportion to the PET loading\nstrengthens the inhibition (Figure 3B)."

These enzymes have at least one order of magnitude\nlower PET-degrading activity than IsPETase, with RgCut-II\nexhibiting the highest activity among the homologues (Fig-\nure 5A). Each of these enzymes presented varying levels of\nconcentration-dependent inhibition under their optimal solu-\ntion conditions, with the exception of RgCut-II (Figure 5B,\nFigure S11), despite this enzyme belonging to the same type IIb\ngroup as IsPETase. There is no clear relationship between the\nextent of inhibition at high concentration and the phylogenetic\ngrouping of the enzymes.\nIn addition, there is no correlation between the levels of PET\nhydrolysis and inhibition, suggesting that the phenomenon is\nnot related to catalytic competence. With the exception of\nSbCut and RgCut-I, DMSO significantly increased the activity of\nthe homologous enzymes, as observed with IsPETase (Figure 5A,\nFigure S12). Any relief of concentration-dependent inhibition\noffered by DMSO is also protein-dependent (Figure S13);\nreduction is seen for PaCut, SbCut, AdCut, and RgCut-I, but not\nfor PsCut, PbauzCut or PoCut.\nIn search of a structural basis\nThe variable susceptibilities of the type II enzymes to concen-\ntration-dependent inhibition suggests that this phenomenon\ncould relate to enzyme structure and/or stability. Both exper-\nimental and computational structure models of these proteins\nwere analyzed to look for protein characteristics associated with\nthe inhibitory behavior. To this end, we solved the crystal\nstructures of three enzymes \u2013 RgCut-II, PsCut and PbauzCut \u2013 to\nhigh resolution (Table S5). As expected, the structures were\nhighly similar, with each conforming to the consensus \u03b1/\u03b2-\nhydrolase fold (Figure S14). However, structural features such as\nthe width of the active site cleft (Figure S15) and the\ndistribution of surface electrostatic charges (Figure S16) show\nno discernible correlation with the degree of concentration-\ndependent inhibition.\nWe next investigated the thermostability of the enzymes by\nmeasuring apparent melting temperature (T\nm\n) values by differ-\nential scanning calorimetry (DSC). These mostly fell in the range\nof 48 to 52 \u00b0 C (Table S6) with the exception of RgCut-II which\nhas an apparent T\nm\nof approximately 67 \u00b0 C; this higher thermo-\nstability may reflect enhanced structural rigidity to the enzyme.\nThe multiple sequence alignment of the RgCut-II with the\nselected enzymes (Figure S17) reveals that RgCut-II has a shorter\nloop between \u03b28 and \u03b16 \u2013 the length of which differentiates\ntype II enzymes from type I \u2013 and which has been proposed to\ncontribute in part to the binding of PET substrate.\n[4]\nTo\ndetermine whether this loop influences the susceptibility to\nconcentration-dependent inhibition, we constructed two mu-\ntants of IsPETase and RgCut-II in which the loop sequences\n(Ser242-Gly243-Asn244-Ser245-Asn246-Gln247-Ala248 and\nAsn234-Ala235-Asn236-Pro237, respectively) were inter-\nchanged. These were designed by alignment of the structures\nof IsPETase and RgCut-II taking into account the conservation of\nresidues either side of the two loops. Verification by alignment\nof the AlphaFold2-predicted\n[29]\nstructural models of the mutants\nsuggested no evident extra structural changes introduced by\nthe loop interchanges. However, DSC analyses indicated that\nthe IsPETase\nRg\n(IsPETase with RgCut-II loop) and RgCut-II\nIs\n(RgCut-II with IsPETase loop) variants were destabilized with\nrespect to their wild-type counterparts by 4.4 and 7.5 \u00b0 C,\nrespectively (Table S6).

In addition, only a small increase in\ninhibition was found with the RgCut-II\nIs\nmutant (Figure S18)\nwith a concomitant loss in activity. These results imply that\nthere is no substantial effect of the extended \u03b28-\u03b16 loop on the\nsusceptibility of IsPETase to concentration-dependent inhib-\nition.\nWe undertook a detailed comparison of RgCut-II and\nIsPETase, with a particular focus on internal structural details.\nWe note that IsPETase has several previously unappreciated\ninternal cavities that may influence in the rigidity of the active\nsite of the enzyme allowing residues mobilities (Figure 6).\nAdjacent to the active site of IsPETase, as well as all the\nanalyzed mesophilic enzymes, a cavity exists between Ala240\nand Ile250 that is substantially filled in RgCut-II by the bulkier\nresidues phenylalanine (Phe232) and valine (Val239; Figure 6).\nFilling this cavity could reduce flexibility of the active site.\nTo test this hypothesis, we made the RgCut-II F232A/V239I\nvariant and investigated its susceptibility to inhibition at high\nconcentration (Figure 6C). This variant exhibited a similar\nmelting temperature to the wild-type RgCut-II enzyme (Ta-\nble S6). Although modest, an increase in concentration-depend-\nent inhibition from 0 to 31 % at 40 \u00b0 C was found, suggesting an\ninverse relationship between active site rigidity and inhibition\nsusceptibility.\nConcentration-dependent inhibition can be reduced by\nenzyme engineering\nIt has been noted that the residues that surround the IsPETase\nactive site differ from those of thermotolerant PET hydrolases.\n[4]\nIn prior work, it was shown that interchanging two residues at\nthe active site (W159H/S238F)\n[30]\nenhances the melting temper-\nature of IsPETase by 10 \u00b0 C, and its activity at elevated\ntemperatures.\n[16]\nHere, we found that this double mutant also\nshows reduced susceptibility to inhibition at high concentration\ncompared to the wild-type enzyme at both pH 8.0 and pH 9.0\n(Figure 7). It is noteworthy that the residue Ser238 variation to\nphenylalanine or tyrosine is common amongst the type II\nenzymes (Figure S17, Figure S19), including RgCut-II (Phe230),\nwith no evident effect on inhibition, suggesting that the double\nmutant needs both substitutions to affect its increased thermal\nstability and reduced susceptibility to inhibition. From a\nstructural point of view, this combination of mutations may\nstabilize the loop structure where the active site histidine\n(His237) is located, reducing its flexibility.\nInhibition is eliminated in HotPETase\nSince, for the IsPETase W159H/S238F variant, a gain in thermo-\nstability accompanies a decrease in concentration-dependent\ninhibition, we investigated the phenomenon in two other,\npreviously reported, thermostable variants, IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/\nR280A[31]\nand HotPETase.\n[3]\nThe latter has multiple mutations and\nexhibits a dramatic increase in thermostability with an apparent\nT\nm\nof 83.8 \u00b0 C under our measurement conditions (Table S6) and\nan optimal activity temperature of 65 \u00b0 C. However, HotPETase\nhas the unusual property of maintaining the same activity as\nthe wild-type enzyme at lower temperature\n[3]\nwhich allows for\ncomparison of any concentration-dependent inhibition under\nthe same conditions. Compared to the wild-type IsPETase, the\ninhibition in IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A\nis greatly reduced at 30 \u00b0 C\n(Figure 8A), minimal at 40 \u00b0 C (Figure S20A), and abolished at\n50 \u00b0 C (Figure S20B), although PET hydrolysis activity is drastically\nlower at this highest temperature. Similarly, concentration-\ndependent inhibition is totally absent in HotPETase at 30 \u00b0 C\n(Figure 8A), corroborating the observation that increased\nthermostability is often correlated with reduced inhibition.\nAnalysis of the HotPETase structure indicates that the number\nof cavities is reduced in this enzyme including in the region of\nthe active site (Figure S21). Finally, comparative molecular\ndynamics simulations of wild-type IsPETase and HotPETase\nreveal that HotPETase has significantly less flexibility in the\nvicinity of the active site (Figure 8B, Figure S22), further\nsupporting the association of concentration-dependent inhib-\nition with active site flexibility.\nFigure 6.

      "text": "Enzymes working at surfaces, such as in plastic biodegradation,\ncontend with challenges not observed in solution, for example,\nstrong orientational effects and high local enzyme concentra-\ntions. In such interfacial catalysis, the reaction rate is hyperbolic\nwith respect to enzyme concentration, due to the saturation of\naccessible scissile bonds on the substrate.\n[15,17]\nIn contrast to\nthis, here we have shown that for IsPETase and numerous\nmesophilic homologues, the extent of reaction is not hyperbolic\nin profile; instead, it reaches a maximum then falls as the\nenzyme concentration rises.\n[2,15,20]\nIn this study, we analyzed concentration-dependent inhib-\nition in multiple natural IsPETase homologues and engineered\nvariants of IsPETase itself, and we demonstrated that the extent\nof inhibition on PET is related to the dynamic properties of the\nenzyme, including regions around the active site; less thermo-\nstable enzymes are often more susceptible to inhibition at high\nenzyme concentration. For each enzyme, the extent of inhib-\nition depends on temperature, solution conditions (pH and the\nconcentration of DMSO), and substrate surface area. The\ninfluence of these parameters can explain the different results\nobtained previously for the enzyme concentration dependence\nof IsPETase in different studies.\n[2,16,20]\nHowever, a molecular\nexplanation for these observations is beyond the scope of this\nwork; it will require future developments in our collective\nunderstanding of enzymatic properties at the solid-liquid inter-\nface and how these influence PET depolymerization perform-\nance.\nA previous study of the surface adsorption to PET particles\nby PET-degrading enzymes including IsPETase, showed a strong\nadsorption\n[32]\n(with a K\nd\nfor IsPETase of 22 nm), with a\nconcomitant formation of an enzyme monolayer when the\nsubstrate surface is saturated. In our study, concentration-\ndependent inhibition occurs at concentrations above 50\u2013\n100 nm enzyme with the PET films. Given the dimensions of our\nstadium-shaped PET film coupons (13 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.25 mm), and a\ncalculated footprint of IsPETase on PET particles (9 nm\n2\n),\n[32]\nwe\ncan estimate a maximal surface coverage of 1.42 nmol g\n\u0000 1\nPET,\nequivalent to around 15 pmol per film piece. With these\nparameters, the mole fraction of bound enzyme at maximal\nactivity, calculated as described previously,\n[32]\ncould be esti-\nmated to 0.23 with an occupancy of 11.7 pmol per film piece at\n100 nm, close to the monolayer limit of 15. This occupancy\nvalue indicates a high coverage for IsPETase on the film for the\nenzyme concentrations at which inhibition is evident.\nThe fact that concentration-dependent inhibition is wit-\nnessed on PET film but not on PET powder (of an equivalent\nmass) is an argument against the possibility of aggregation-\nmediated enzyme inactivation in bulk solution or a reduction in\navailable substrate scissile bonds by enzyme hydrolysis. More-\nover, the appearance of concentration-dependent inhibition at\nhigh enzyme coverage is consistent with an inhibitory surface\ncrowding effect as described previously.\n[15,16]\nUnder crowding\nconditions, lateral enzyme\u2013enzyme interactions could poten-\ntially interfere with enzyme-substrate binding. For example,\nthey may change the enzyme orientation with respect to the\nplastic surface leading to binding at unproductive sites on the\nenzyme. Alternatively, crowding could elicit conformational\nchanges in the enzyme exposing unproductive binding sites\nresulting in surface capture of enzyme molecules in inactive\norientations. In support of this, overshooting adsorption \u2013\nwhere adherence to a hydrophobic surface is enhanced\ncompared to the simple adsorption-desorption Langmuir model\n\u2013 has been associated with a high bulk protein concentration,\nand explained by an alteration, over time, in the orientation of\nprotein absorbed on the surface.\n[33]"

      "text": "inhibition of IsPETase is greater at pH 9.0 than pH 8.0. Since\npH 9.0 is closer to the enzyme\u2019s pI (9.65), a reduction in\nelectrostatic repulsion between enzyme molecules could allow\nfor greater packing densities on the surface,\n[33]\nthus exacerbat-\ning any inhibitory effects. Similarly, DMSO may relieve inhibitory\nenzyme\u2013enzyme hydrophobic interactions at the plastic surface.\nIn fact, DMSO can change several properties of proteins\nincluding their binding capacity.\n[34]\nFurthermore, the effect of\nDMSO is known to be protein-dependent\n[35]\nexplaining its varied\ninfluence on activity and enzyme concentration-dependent\ninhibition among the studied mesophilic enzymes.\nAlthough not apparent with the first 30 min of incubation,\nthe inhibition accumulates rapidly during the following few\nhours. This temporal dependence could be explained by a time-\ndependent accumulation of non-productively bound enzyme,\nas described in the above overshooting absorption kinetic\nmodel.\n[33]\nIn addition, the lack of concentration-dependent\ninhibition during the initial incubation phase could be due to\nthe early release of PET fragments (soluble or insoluble) by\nendo-type cleavage\n[36,37]\nwhich may recruit and sequester\nenzyme molecules thus decreasing the initial rate of surface\ndeposition. Whilst it is possible that the product inhibition that\nhas been reported for other PET degrading enzymes\n[8]\ncould\nplay a role in concentration-dependent inhibition, this seems\nunlikely as the phenomenon is evident well before significant\nconcentrations of any monomeric products can accumulate.\nIt is conceivable that crowding-induced changes in enzyme\nconformation \u2013 and, hence, a reduction in PET degrading\nactivity \u2013 would be exacerbated for enzymes of lower structural\nrigidity. Indeed, previous molecular dynamic simulations re-\nvealed greater mobility in the active site of IsPETase than\nthermophilic enzymes like LCC and TfCut2;\n[38]\nin general, unlike\nIsPETase, such thermophilic enzymes do not exhibit concen-\ntration-dependent inhibition at their optimal temperatures.\n[15]\nThis contrast in behaviors could arise both from differences in\nenzyme biophysical properties, and from differential substrate\naccessibility at the enzymes\u2019 optimal temperatures. However,\nthe contribution of the latter factor might seem less important\nbecause those surface polymer chains in the vicinity of the bulk\nsolvent (and, hence, most susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis)\nalready have a considerably lower glass transition temperature\n(T\ng\n= 40\u201348 \u00b0 C) compared to those buried within the bulk\nmaterial (T\ng\n= 65\u201371 \u00b0 C);\n[8,37]\nthis difference is due to an intrinsi-\ncally lower degree of order near the polymer surface, com-\npounded by plasticization due to water ingress.\n[8]\nHowever, the\nobserved alleviation of IsPETase\nS121E/D186H/R280A\nconcentration-\nChemSusChem\nResearch Article\ndoi.org/10.1002/cssc.202202277\nChemSusChem 2023, 16, e202202277 (8 of 12) \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
