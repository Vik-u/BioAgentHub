Depolymerization experiments were performed on a Monowave 450 microwave 487 \nreactor (Anton Paar GmbH). This batch microwave reactor controls the temperature, time, and 488 \nmaximum set power. Typically, 500 mg of textiles, 5 mL of EG, and 5 mg of the catalyst were 489 \nplaced in a microwave reaction vial. The vial was inserted into the microwave reactor, and the 490 \nreactor was programmed to maintain a constant temperature. On completion of a reaction, the 491 \nreaction vial was allowed to cool down rapidly to room temperature. 100 mL of distilled water was 492 \nadded to separate BHET and oligomers. The unreacted polymer and larger oligomers were 493 \nremoved using a Whatman filter paper. The residual water from the product solution was then 494 \nevaporated under vacuum (72 mbar) at 60 \u00b0C using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting BHET 495 \nwas crystallized by cooling the residual solution overnight to 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator after the 496 \naddition of a small amount of distilled water to the residue.

      "text": "Cellular uptake of TPA is controlled by pH 89 \nTo measure apparent uptake of carboxylate group containing PET deconstruction products 90 \ninto E. coli, we created an enzyme -coupled assay based on heterologous expression of a CAR 91 \nshown in vitro to possess activity on our candidate substrates (CAR from Mycobacterium avium, 92 \nMaCAR)36 (Fig. 2A). To retain desired aldehyde products for eventual upcycling reactions, we 93 \nexpressed MaCAR in the previously engineered E. coli RARE.\u039416 strain designed for TPAL 94 \nretention37. We supplemented TPA, MHET, as well as mono-substituted carboxylates FBA (the 95 \nsingle reduction product of TPA) and 4 -hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA, a potential over-96 \nreduction product), to cells expressing MaCAR at a starting pH of 7.5  under aerobic culturing 97 \nconditions. To ensure that all potential intermediates are collected in the supernatant, we performed 98 \na methanol -based extraction of all collected samples. We observed full conversion of MHET, 99 \nFBA, and HMBA to their respective aldehydes after 4 h, indicating these substrates are readily 100 \nimported by cells (Fig. 2B). However, we observed no conversion of the dicarboxylic acid TPA, 101 \nconsistent with this step being a bottleneck. Interestingly, we did observe the full conversion of 102 \nTPA after 24 h, suggesting a delayed uptake relative to monocarboxylic acids. Given that others 103 \nhave briefly observed that pH can play a role in TPA uptake11, we monitored culture pH alongside 104 \nTPA conversion as a function of time. We found that pH decreases correlated to TPA conversion 105 \n(Fig. 2C), suggesting a simple explanation for the delay. To collect further supporting evidence, 106 \nwe saw that buffering the culture media abrogated TPA conversion (Fig. S1), and that lowering 107 \ninitial culture pH accelerated TPA uptake and conversion (Fig. 2D).  108 \nTo more extensively study how pH affects TPA and MHET import, we transitioned from 109 \ngrowing cells to resting cells , allowing for a more controlled reaction . However, we found that 110 \nresting cells of the engineered RARE.\u039416 host rapidly oxidized TPAL, which is a phenomenon 111 \nnot present in growing cells  and could counteract carboxylate reduction  (Fig. 2E-F). To negate 112 \nthis, we further engineered the RARE.\u039416  to include knockouts of 6 aldehyde dehydrogenases 113 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We 114 \nfound that the ROAR.\u039422 host increased TPAL (4.2-fold) and MHET -ald ( 3.7-fold) 115 \nconcentrations compared to RARE.\u039416 after 4 h (Fig. 2G, Fig. S2). The strain exhibited negligible 116 \nfitness difference nor sensitivity of aldehyde retention in various reaction media (pH and glucose 117 \nconcentration) (Fig. S2-5). We resuspended resting cells of ROAR.\u039422 that expressed MaCAR 118 \nwith TPA or MHET at starting pH  ranging from 4.8 -7.5 in increments of 0.2  (Fig. 2H). As 119 \nexpected, TPA conversion increased as we lowered pH, until TPA precipitated out of solution at 120 \npH 5.0 and 4.8  (Fig. 2I). We could only  observe TPA conversion at pH 6.2 or lower , with a 121 \nmaximum conversion of 92% at pH 5.2, indicating that TPA uptake can occur in acidic pHs. The 122 \nobserved TPA uptake  correlates well with the predicted  formation of the partially deprotonated 123 \nTPA, highlighting the possibility that the mono -protonated form of TPA is accepted by native 124 \ntransporters (Fig. S6). Excitingly, we observed the full conversion of MHET towards MHET -ald 125 \nat all pH tested (Fig. 2J), and we sought to investigate the design of new transformation routes 126 \nthat would exploit this finding. 127 \nScreening of \u201cETase\u201d activity to enhance cellular uptake of PET deconstruction products 128 \nBecause these experiments showed that MHET uptake was fast and unaffected by reaction 129 \npH, we hypothesized that intracellular expression  of selective esterases (here designated as 130 \n\u201cETases\u201d for potential activity on PET, BHET, MHET, and/or MHET-ald) could facilitate 131 \ncomplete ester hydrolysis after uptake (Fig. 3A). We desired an ETase that had activity on BHET, 132 \nMHET and MHET-ald at 30\u00b0C for intracellular TPA production with limited membrane leakage 133 \nthat could lead to TPA production extracellularly 39,40. We screened 10 previously engineered 134 \nETases on BHET, MHET and MHET-ald.  We selected five engineered variants of the Ideonella 135 \nsakaiensis PETase (FAST41, HOT42, Dura43, Themo-Stable: denoted here as Thermo44 and TS45) 136 \ntwo leaf-branch compost cutinase variants  (LCC39, LCC-ICCG: denoted here as ICCG 46), two 137 \nvariants of bacterium HR29  PETase (BhrPETase47 and Turbo48) and one metagenome-derived 138 \nPETase (PES-H1:denoted here as PES49). While many of these enzymes were primarily studied at 139 \nelevated temperatures for PET deconstruction, we sought to measure ETase activity under ambient 140 \nconditions (Table S1). 141 \nWe expressed each ETase initially in RARE.\u039416 in growing cells to track cell viability and 142 \nto test activity on supplemented BHET, MHET and MHET-ald.

Analysis of the ETase activity allowed us to characterize several BHET-146 \nselective ETases, such as  FAST, PES and D URA, which had high BHET conversion and low 147 \nMHET conversion. We also observed several generalist ETases such as BHR, Turbo, LCC, ICCG, 148 \nand HOT, with high conversion of both BHET and MHET. Surprisingly, we noticed that our entire 149 \nlibrary of ETases had activity on MHET-ald (Fig. 3D-E), and obtained higher conversion s on 150 \nMHET-ald than MHET  (Fig. S7-8). After profiling ETase specificity , we noticed a subset of 151 \nETases has substantial effects to overexpression (BHR, Turbo, ICCG and PES) with others having 152 \nminor effects (Thermo, TS, LCC, Dura, HOT and FAST) (Fig. 3F). Considering both activity and 153 \ntoxicity, FAST showed promise for further applications. 154 \nCoupling ETase and CAR to explore the enhanced uptake of BHET and MHET  155 \nAfter identification of viable ETases, we reasoned that by expressing FAST and MaCAR 156 \ntogether in one-pot we could produce TPAL from BHET and MHET at neutral pH in growing cells 157 \n(Fig. 3G). We compared expression of FAST and MaCAR in separate cells (Cell A and Cell B , 158 \nrespectively) as against expression in the same cell (Cell C) . We hypothesized that expression of 159 \nFAST and MaCAR in the same cell could directly result in TPAL, potentially fully circumventing 160 \nTPA accumulation. First, we showed that supplemented TPA is not consumed under well-buffered 161 \nconditions (Fig. 3H). We then tested if supplying MHET or BHET would yield TPAL. Excitingly, 162 \nwe observed TPAL synthesis in all reaction conditions starting from MHET and BHET, indicating 163 \nboth strategies are viable alternatives to avoid challenges posed by TPA uptake. Using Cell C, we 164 \nobtained high TPAL yields of 82.7% or 98.0% from 5 mM MHET or BHET, respectively (Fig. 165 \n3I-J). Using Cell A and B in co-culture, we found that a 1:1 inoculation ratio resulted in optimum 166 \nTPAL yields of 82.6% and 68.8% from MHET and BHET, respectively. To further highlight our 167 \napproach, we tested both strategies in resting cells with MHET or BHET as our starting substrates. 168 \nWe again saw TPAL production in all our reaction conditions starting from 5 mM MHET or BHET 169 \n(Fig. S9). We observed high TPAL yields of 77% or 88% from MHET or BHET, respectively 170 \nusing Cell C . These results indicate that coupling intercellular TPA  synthesis to downstream 171 \nenzymatic transformations can effectively enable TPA valorization using cells. 172 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

To do this, we used a 177 \ntransaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum, which has been shown to accept PET-derived 178 \naldehydes36. Additionally, we co-expressed an alanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis  179 \n(AlaDH) to recycle pyruvate back to the alanine amine donor. We first investigated the operating 180 \npH range of CvTA  in resting whole cells . We noticed that as reaction pH is lowered, para-181 \naminomethyl benzoic acid (pAMBA) accumulates, presumably via endogenous oxidation  (Fig 182 \n4A). We observed that the amination of 5 mM TPAL had an optimal conversion to pXYL at pH 183 \n7.5, resulting in a 90% conversion after 1 h (Fig. 4B). These results highlight a unique challenge 184 \nif we were to start with TPA as an initial substrate as low pH is needed for TPA uptake, but higher 185 \npH is optimal for amination. Despite our progress with alternative PET deconstruction products, 186 \nwe chose to investigate addressing this when starting from TPA by employing a one-pot, two-step 187 \napproach (Fig. 4C) in which the reaction is pH-adjusted from that optimal for TPA to that optimal 188 \nfor CvTA. For this reaction, we supplemented 5 mM TPA at a starting pH of 7.5 or 5.2. For the 189 \npH 5.2 case, after 2 h we increased pH to 7.5 with NaOH. After which, cells expressing CvTA and 190 \nAlaDH (Cell D) were supplemented in both conditions and the reactions were ran for an additional 191 \n2 h. As expected, when starting at a pH of 7.5, we observed no TPA conversion  (Fig. 4D).  192 \nHowever, when starting at a pH of 5.2, we obtained a 97% conversion to the desired  diamine 193 \npXYL (Fig. 4E).  194 \nWhile we achieve d high conversion to pXYL from TPA  using pH adjustment, we next 195 \naimed to produce amines without pH adjustment using MHET or BHET as starting substrates. For 196 \ndirect comparisons of pXYL conversion from TPA to that of our proposed cascade starting from 197 \nMHET or BHET, we continued to run our reactions in a one-pot two-step approach, meaning that 198 \nCell D was added after 2 h. We ran reactions using our Cell C as well as the best performing Cell 199 \nA:B ratio to generate TPAL from MHET and BHET. Using Cells A, B and D, we obtained pXYL 200 \nyields of 80.5% from MHET or 57.4% from BHET (Fig. 4 F, G). With Cell C and D, we observed 201 \nhigh pXYL yields of 93.1% from MHET or 95.9% from BHET. We also examined whether we 202 \ncould selectively  biosynthesize the  antifibrinolytic drug , para-aminomethyl benzoic acid 203 \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As MaCAR has been shown to have 204 \nminimal activity on pAMBA, we hypothesized that we could  target pAMBA synthesis using a 205 \none-pot one-step approach36. We found that our t hree-cell approach at a cellular ration of 1:10:2 206 \nof Cells A:B:D resulting in 83% yield pAMBA from 5 mM MHET (Fig. S10).  207 \nReaction scaleup and upcycling of post-consumer PET waste 208 \nGiven that coupling FAST and MaCAR in the same cell showed high  TPAL and pXYL 209 \nyields at 5 mM concentrations of either MHET or BHET, we investigated the ability of  our 210 \nupcycling cascade for either substrate at elevated substrate loading of 10, 20, or 40 mM. We ran 211 \nthese reactions at an increased glucose concentration (80 mM) to ensure sufficient co-factors for 212 \ncarboxylate reduction. For either substrate, we sampled at 4 and 8 h. We observed high yields of 213 \nTPAL in just 4 h with each concentration tested for both supplemented MHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 214 \nmM: 83%; 40 mM: 80%) and BHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 mM: 79%; 40 mM: 79%) (Fig. S11). At 8 215 \nh, we found the yield at 40 mM increased slightly for MHET (84%) and BHET (89%).  216 \nAfter successfully achieving TPAL production at increased substrate loading, we scaled up 217 \nour cascade to a 10 mL reaction volume (from 300 \u00b5L) and used intermediate PET deconstruction 218 \nsubstrates from glycolysis of  post-consumer textile or plastic  waste (Fig. 5A). Using previously 219 \nestablished methods, we performed catalytic glycolysis on a 100% polyester red T-shirt resulting 220 \nin mixture of 78% BHET, 21% MHET and 1% TPA 51. We also conducted glycolysis on a post-221 \nconsumer PET plastic bottle that resulted in a mixture of 99% BHET and 1% MHET mixture 52. 222 \nWe next ran our one -pot two -step method to target pXYL production  starting from these  223 \ndeconstruction products. Both solid residues were resuspended in our cellular reaction buffer at an 224 \nestimated 40 mM concentration.  We supplemented Cell C for 8 h and then added Cell D and let 225 \nthe reaction run for an addition 8 h for a total of 16 h. We were excited to see the full conversion 226 \nof deconstruction products in both reactions, with pXYL yields of 89.5% or 90.5% from polyester 227 \ntextile waste or post-consumer PET plastic waste, respectively  (Fig. 5B, C ). As both PET 228 \ndeconstruction and upcycling steps resulted in high yields, our tandem chemical deconstruction 229 \nand biological upcycling strategy resulted in overall pXYL yields of >80%.  230"
