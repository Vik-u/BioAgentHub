      "text": "2.1 | Molecular docking\nConsidering that the binding mode of PET in theIsPETase structure\nwas not previously elucidated using experimental methods, we per-\nformed molecular docking of an oligomer consisting of four monomers\nin their low free-energy conformations to analyze the selectivity and\naffinity of the polymer during the initial stages of the PETase catalytic\nprocess. Considering the wild-type structure ofI. sakaiensis PETase\n(PDB: 6EQE, X-ray diffraction with 0.92 \u00c5 resolution) was the first\nreported mesophilic enzyme with affinity and catalytic activity against\nthe PET,\n24 we choose this structure with high resolution as a target to\nperform a detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions established\nbetween the protein and the PET.\nTo perform the molecular docking against theIsPETase binding\nsubsites, we used the AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2)33 program with\nthe following forms mimicking PET: monomer (bis-[hydroxyethyl] tere-\nphthalate, BHET), dimer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-hydroxyethyl tere-\nphthalate)\n2, 2-HE(MHET) 2), and tetramer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-\nhydroxyethyl terephthalate)4, 2-HE(MHET)2).13 Conjecturing that the\nconformation of the PET tetramer in theIsPETase corresponds to that\nof individual monomers bound atIsPETase subsites I to IV, we sequen-\ntially constructed three models of PET: Model I comprises the individual\nPET monomers against four proposed binding subsites of PETase. In\nModel II, we combined two PET monomers, thus forming a dimer to\ndock against two adjacentIsPETase binding subsites. In Model III, we\njoined the four PET monomers forming a tetramer to dock against four\npotential adjacent PETase binding subsites (subsites I to IV). Table S1\nshows the parameters used in the docking of the three models of PET.\nThe molecular docking in the AutoDock Vina was performed con-\nsidering the flexibility of the residues from the subsites (Tyr87,\nTrp159, Ser160, Met161, Ile208, Asn233, His 237, Ser238, Asn241,\nand Arg280), as well as the flexibility of the ligand. The following Car-\ntesian coordinates of the center of the docking grid, in \u00c5, were\napplied: X = /C0 0.51, Y = 4.23, and Z = 20.09; with dimensions of\nx = 70, y = 56, andz = 68 for PET flexible docking.\nFurther validation was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker\n(MVD)\n34 and CSD-GOLD35; then compared with the conformations\nobtained by the AutoDock Vina (available in Tables S1 and S3).

      "text": "suggested the PETase backbone does not present high conformational\nchanges upon PET binding, since its movement is limited to the bind-\ning subsite.\n14,28 Indeed, our PCA results show that the main move-\nment of IsPETase is associated with \u03b27-\u03b15 and \u03b21-\u03b22 connecting\nloops motion. Since PCA describes the largest amplitude protein\nmotions during a simulation, the bi-dimensional free energy landscape\n(FEL) was obtained taking into consideration the bidimensional projec-\ntions of PC1 versus PC2, which are considered the coordinates used\nfor obtaining the FEL. The FEL of IsPETase in the unbound state\nshowed that at the beginning of the MD, the conformations acquired\nby theIsPETase structure were similar to those obtained at the end of\nthe simulation, thus demonstrating that conformational states of the\nIsPETase were not altered dramatically over the MD trajectory, which\nis in agreement with previous experimental data.\n14,28 We also\nobserved for the analysis of the PCAPC2vsPC3 and PCAPC1vsPC3 plots, a\nconformational dispersion at the end of MD simulation that not\nformed isolated clusters. It is important to note that the conforma-\ntions of the PC1 were not directly correlated with those found in\nPC3, thus demonstrating that the initial conformations were grouped\nseparately from the other conformations that do not contain the PET\nat the binding site (see Figure S9).\nThe main difference between the most stable structure of\nIsPETase-PET complex (P1 in Figure 5) andIsPETase in the unbound\nstate (P4 in Figure 5) is in the \u03b27-\u03b15 connecting loop, where we\nnoted that the Asp206 opened the cavity of the active site. Other\nconformational states with high probability were described for the\nunbound state with P2 with a reduced cavity and P3 with an\nopened cavity similar to that of P1 (Figure 5A). Considering that the\nstructural engineering ofIsPETase using site-direct mutagenesis has\nled to optimized catalysis of PET,\n13,25,69 finding the most stable\nconformation of its structure is an important task for the\nimprovement of its active site selectivity and also to better under-\nstand the conformational mechanism of the enzyme that influences\nin the catalysis.\nThe IsPETase has large regions with polar surface charges with\nfew regions with acidic residues (red surfaces, Figure S10). In the sub-\nsite of monomer 1, more neutral regions are observed, while for the\nother monomers regions high hydrophobic surfaces are detected.\nThere is an increase of the cavity's volumes (see Figure S6) of the sub-\nsites when theIsPETase structure is complexed with the PET, demon-\nstrating conformational conservation of the catalytic triad. It is\nimportant to point out that the wide cleft in the active site would be\nnecessary to accommodate semi-aromatic crystalline polyesters.\n24\nRecently, Knott et al studied the catalytic mechanism of the MHETase\nenzyme converting MHET to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.70\nThe authors demonstrated that the main domain of MHETase is simi-\nlar in the residue composition toIsPETase, which suggests insights\ninto the hydrolysis mechanism of PET performed by theIsPETase.70\nHowever, the mobility of key residues and loops during the binding\nand catalysis remains unclear. Our analyzes of FEL revealed an\nincrease in IsPETase stiffness upon binding of PET, which suggests\nthat binding of PET gives rise to an effective motion of\u03b27-\u03b15 con-\nnecting loop, which could have a direct influence on the PET binding\nand catalysis. In particular, we suggest that the rearrangement of this\nloop may be relevant for enabling the adoption of a proper conforma-\ntion for PET recognition.\nThe comparison ofIsPETase states analyzed in the FEL plots (see\nFigure 5 and Figure S11), revealed that the P1 (unbound) and P4\n(bound) states demonstrate that the main conformational change in\nthe transition between the unbound state to the bound state is asso-\nciated with\u03b27-\u03b15 connecting loop, which that exhibits movements of\nthe residue Asp206 (see Figure S11). In P1 (Figure 5, PETase free), this\nresidue interacts with His237 through hydrogen bond (1.78 \u00c5) in\nIsPETase in the unbound state. While the mobility of the\u03b26-\u03b27 con-\nnecting loop is associated mainly with the residue Trp185, which has\na fluctuation in the change of states, while important catalytic resi-\ndues, such as Trp159, Ser160, and His237 remain in stable conforma-\ntions (see Figure 5C,D, and Figure S11).\nConsidering that the conformations located at the minima have\nsimilarities to each other, we found that the conformations in P2 and\nP3 of theIsPETase in the unbound state demonstrated a similar con-\nformational change in the connecting\u03b27-\u03b15 loop (loop 10) to accom-\nmodate the PET substrate (Figure S11A). The minimum conformations\nof IsPETase located at the P5 and P6 showed the PET structure in\ntwo conformations, that is, a planar and L-shape configuration,\nrespectively. The positions of His237 and Ser160 residues were also\nmaintained in both minima. However, it is important to note that the\nAsp209 residue suffers the most conformational changes and\nthe Arg280 residue also showed a variation in its position due to the\nalteration of PET configuration to planar to L-shape. The\u03c0-\u03c0 interac-\ntion between Trp185 and the ring of the first monomer was\nmaintained in both minima (Figure S11B). Interestingly, the connecting\n\u03b21-\u03b22 loop (loop 3) variations were not observed for these minimum\nconformations.\n1348 DA COSTA ET AL.\n 10970134, 2021, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26155 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2025].

The SHAKE\nalgorithm was applied for all hydrogen bonds in the analyzed systems.\nIt is worth noting that restraint forces in the ligand structures in com-\nplex with the molecular receptor are widely applied to allow the con-\nformational adaptation of the receptor structure to the ligands, thus,\nestablishing favorable intermolecular interaction.\n44,45 It is important\nto highlight that the restraints force also increases the conformational\nstability of the complex throughout the MD simulation, avoiding the\nloss of the interaction between the investigated structures, and misin-\nterpretation of the binding free energy values.\n46,47\nIn the production stage of the unbound and bound systems (sys-\ntems I and II, respectively), we performed 500 ns of MD simulations\nfor each system using the NPT ensemble, and each system was repli-\ncated and assigned with different initial velocities to generate inde-\npendent simulations.\n2.3 | Principal component analysis and free energy\nlandscape\nThe principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that allows to\nreduce the dimensions of the analyzed trajectories during the MD\nsimulation of the covariance matrix (C), thus reducing the linear corre-\nlations between the spatial coordinates and converting them into a\nset of an orthogonal vector named principal component (PC) which\ndescribes the movements using the Cartesian coordinatesX, Y, and\nZ of each analyzed atom.\n48 This technique has been widely combined\nwith MD simulations to evaluate the conformational changes of pro-\ntein structures.40,49-55 Here, the CPPTRAJ module available in the\nAmber16 package was used to obtain the trajectories ofIsPETase\nstructures using the C\u03b1 coordinates over the 500 ns of MDs to gener-\nate the principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3).

Conformational changes can play a crucial role in\nregulating the PET binding to the hydrophobic subsites and in the\ncontrol of the catalysis. We noticed in the PCA analysis that the resi-\ndues Asp206 and Trp185 are very flexible. The results also show con-\nsiderable fluctuations in the residue His237 at\u03b28-\u03b16 connecting loop.\nThen, we conjecture that these residues are key residues for the\nmechanism of binding and release of PET.\nPCA result also shows that the most flexible region of the protein\nis located at\u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loops for both systemsIsPETase in the\nunbound and the bound states (Figure 4). It is worth noting that these\nessential dynamics involve almost 37.8% and 25.6% of the motion of\nthe unbound and in the bound systems, respectively (see\nAppendix S1). The results also reveal that participation in the confor-\nmational flexibility of \u03b27-\u03b15 and \u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loop is higher in\nIsPET-PETase complex than inIsPETase without ligand. Therefore, we\nsuggest that the\u03b21-\u03b22 connecting loop may be targeted for mutagen-\nesis to increase theIsPETase stability since it is located far from the\nactive site."
