Although the industrially-relevant use of\nenzymes in PET degradation is still in its early stages, an\nengineered variant of the leaf-branch compost cutinase\n(LCC) has already enabled nearly complete depolymer-\nization of pre-treated PET bottle waste and virgin poly-\nmers were re-synthesized using the recovered TA [17]. A\nsignificant milestone in PET breakdown was the identi-\nfication of the Gram-negative aerobic\u03b2-proteobacterium\nIdeonella sakaiensis by screening of 250 environmental\nsamplesobtainedfromaPETbottlerecyclingsiteinJapan\n[18].

Recycling plastics\nsuch as PET with enzymes is one of the recently\ndeveloped methods to mitigate the plastic pollu-\ntion and to promote the circularity of material\nflowforasustainable plastic economy.Theenzy-\nmatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate\nis more feasible at higher incubation tempera-\ntures.Therefore,mesophilicenzymessuchasthe\nIsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis need to be\nengineered, revealing higher thermostability and\nactivity by protein engineering methods such as\ndirectedevolution.\nDespitethis,onlyone IsPETasestructurehasbeensolved\nso far with a co-crystallized ligand analogous to MHET\n[19].IsPETaseexhibitsatypical \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolasefoldconsist-\ningofseven \u03b1-helicesandnine \u03b2-strandsformingacentral\ntwisted \u03b2-sheet [21], which is highly conserved among\nmany other cutinase-like PET-hydrolyzing enzymes [26].\nThe catalytic triad ofIsPETase, located on the protein\nsurface, is composed of the amino acids S160-D206-H237\n[22].Theenzymehastwointramoleculardisulfidebridges,\nwhereas the structurally homologous cutinases TfCut2\nfrom Thermobifida fusca and LCC only have one [19,\n27].

In homologous enzymes, these\nserine and isoleucine residues are replaced by histidine\nor phenylalanine, respectively, restricting the movement\nof the tryptophan and thus lowering the activity for PET\ndegradation[28].\nU n l i k eL C Co rT f C u t 2f r o mT. fusca, IsPETase is a\nmesophilic enzyme with a melting point (Tm) of approx-\nimately45\u25e6C,anditisthusthermallyunstableforapplica-\ntionsathighertemperatures[ 16,29,30 ].Thecrystallinity\nof PET influences the efficiency of enzymatic PET degra-\ndation[16,31].Thepresenceofhighlyorderedcrystalline\ncontentinaspecificPETsamplereducestheoverallmobil-\nity of the polymer chains and their accessibility to enzy-\nmatichydrolysis[ 29,32].Incomparison,theless-ordered\namorphous fraction is significantly more susceptible to\nenzymatic attack at a reaction temperature close to the\nglass transition temperature (Tg)o fP E T[29].

For instance, an improvement of\nIsPETaseactivitywasachievedbytheR280Asubstitution\n[20].

Increased thermosta-\nbilityisthereforeadvantageousforthe IsPETase-catalyzed\ndegradation of PET. A good example in this study is the\ncomparison of the TM and TM1 variants. In the degrada-\ntionofPETnanoparticles,theTMvariantshowedahigher\ntotal product formation at 40\u25e6C than TM1.

There, this variant showed an\napproximately two-fold increase in relative activity com-\nparedtoTM(Table S4).SinceTMonlyhasaT m of56.5\u25e6C,\nit is highly probable that this variant is inactivated much\nfasterovertheperiodof72hthanTM1andthereforeless\nproductwasreleased(Figure 4).\nFor variants containing the K95N and F201I substitu-\ntions, low activities for hydrolysis of PET nanoparticles\nwereobserved.TheaminoacidF201islocatedinadeeply\nhiddenhydrophobiccoreof IsPETase,whichadditionally\nconsistsofpositionsW97,L101,M157,L199,L230,W257and\nM258 [37].

This is consistent with the observations\nby Yoshida et al. who also showed that MHET was the\nmajor product forIsPETase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PET\n[18]. According to Yoshida et al., degradation of MHET\nby IsPETase should not be possible [18]. However, in the\ndegradationofamorphousPETfilm,TAisthemainprod-\nuct, since MHET is degraded byIsPETase with extended\nincubation time. The same reaction has already been\ndescribed elsewhere [46]. A prolonged incubation of the\nPETathightemperaturescanleadtoaslowtransformation\nof mobile amorphous fractions to rigid amorphous frac-\ntions, which are less degradable by the enzyme [16].

Higher thermostability could\nalso be achieved by combination of four stabilizing sub-\nstitutions with already promising published variants. For\nthe effective degradation of PET by enzymes, the right\nbalance between hydrolytic activity and thermostability\nis essential. As demonstrated with IsPETase variants\ncontaining the K95N and F201I substitutions, even a\nslightlynegativeinfluenceofamutationontheactivityof\nPET hydrolysis can be compensated by the simultaneous\nincrease ofTm for degradation reaction at higher incuba-\ntiontemperatures.Thisledtoanimprovedeffectivenessin\nPET degradation by theseIsPETase variants.

A notably improved\nperformance in PET hydrolysis was observed with all\nvariants when the incubation temperature was increased\nfrom 30\u25e6Ct o4 0\u25e6C. Even the WT showed increased\nactivity at higher temperatures, although theTm is only\n45\u25e6C( T a b l e2) and the overall yield of degradation prod-\nucts was markedly lower than with the other variants.\nComparing the TM related variants, it can be observed\nthat the introduction of the K95N and F201I substitu-\ntion into the existing TM2 variant as well as into the TM\nresulted in a decrease in total product release, defined\n 16182863, 2022, 3-4, Downloaded from https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.202100105 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2025].
