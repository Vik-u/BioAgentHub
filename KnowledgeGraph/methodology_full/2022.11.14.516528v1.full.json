When p-\nNPB is hydrolyzed, butyrate and p-nitrophenolate ion s are produced, and the latter can be \nmeasured via UV/VIS spectrophotomet ry at 409 nm. IsPETase variants (200 nM IsPETase \nmutant in 200 \u00b5l of 50 mM glycine-NaOH [pH 9.0]) were inactivated at 60\u00b0C or 70\u00b0C (1\u201336 \nh) and then chilled in an ice bath for 10 min.

      "text": "Increase in protein yield through \u03b2-strand modification of the hydrophobic core \nBecause amorphous polymeric chains can be crystallized above Tg and the \ndeformability of the crystalline region is much lower than that of the amorphous region , the \noptimal temperature for the operation of an artificial enzyme depolymerization system is \napproximately 60\u00b0C\u201370\u00b0C (Fig. 1a) .12,23 We hypothesized that  a mesophilic depolymerase \nemerged to have improved thermal stability would outperform other thermophilic enzymes at \nall temperatures, as high activity at low temperatures is a result of the sum effect of turnover \nrate, adsorption rate , and attack capacity on solid PET (Fig. 1a) . Thus, we evaluated the \npotential activity of a mesophilic depolymerase at desired temperatures  with an aim of \nimproving the thermal stability of IsPETase without compromising its activity. To this end, we \nintroduced N233C and S282C mutations to create an additional disulfide bond  (SS1) in the \nquadruple-point IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N246D variant (Is-4p) that we previously reported ,22 \nresulting in the generation of the IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N233C/N246D/S288C variant ( Is-4pC) \n(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).22,24 Surprisingly, the derivative melting temperature (TmD) of \nIs-4pC was found to be 72\u00b0C, which was 10 \u00b0C and 23\u00b0C higher than that of Is-4p and wild-\ntype IsPETase, respectively (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, Is-4pC exhibited \n1.5 and 5-fold higher PET depolymerization activity than those of Is-4p and wild-type IsPETase, \nrespectively, at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 1b). However, the expression of Is-4pC dramatically reduced the \namount of soluble protein compared with wild-type, and most of the expressed protein formed \ninsoluble aggregates (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). This limited further evaluation of \nPET depolymerization capacity and analysis of potential applications of th e variant. The \nproduction of large amounts of soluble PET hydrolase is an important parameter in industrial-\nlevel PET biodegradation in addition to its thermal stability and activity. Thus, we attempted \nto increase the solubility of IsPETase by reconstructing the \u03b2-sheet that is partially disrupted \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Interestingly, all variants exhibited up to 25-fold increase in soluble \nprotein yield compared with Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) . However, most \nvariants showed  a dramatically decrease in TmD values and PET hydrolysis activities \n(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). One exception was the P181V variant, which exhibited \ncomparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity to Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3) . \nIntroduction of the P181V mutation into Is-4pC resulted in a 40-fold increase in soluble protein \nyield compared with Is-4pC, with comparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 1b, \nc, Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133). We further observed no significant difference between Is -\n4pC+P181V and Is -4pC in Tm D values and the total amount of expressed protein, which \nindicate that the enhanced yield of  the soluble Is-4pC+P181V protein is not due to increased \nintracellular protein stability or enhanced transcriptional and translational processes, but rather \ndue to post-translational folding. Specifically, mutation of the trans-proline 181 unchains the \ndihedral angles of this residue, especially at the \u03c8 angle, triggering a large change in the \u03c6 angle \nof the pre -proline A180 (Fig. 1 d). We speculated that this structural change occur s in most \nP181-point variants and strengthens the \u03b2-strand network, thereby increasing the efficiency of \nfolding of the Is-4pC+P181V variant (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4). \nThe region containing A180 and P181 is located at the intersection of two imaginary \nhemispheres of the protein hydrophobic core. The above results indicate the importance of this \nregion in folding of the protein (Fig. 1f). We replaced A180 of Is-4pC+P181V with other small \nresidues, such as G, S, T, and V , to investigate how further modification of the region affects \nprotein solubility. Interestingly, all four variants showed an increase in soluble protein yield \n(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, Is-4pC+A180V+P181V (an Is-8p variant) \nshowed an approximately 65% increase in soluble protein yield compared with Is-4pC+P181V , \nwhich corresponds to a 65-fold increase compared with Is-4pC (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Moreover, the thermal stability and PET hydrolysis activity of Is-8p were \ncomparable to those of Is-4pC (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). This implies that the \nfolding process of IsPETase is influenced by multiple structural factors as well as \u03b2-sheet repair \nat the protein core. \n \nEngineering with non-negative and complementary accumulation \nThe improved soluble protein yield of Is -8p led us to apply various enzym e \nengineering approaches. We modified the local surface charge of Is-8p by mutating R132 and \nR224 to E and substituting N37 with D in an attempt to optimize the adsorption process of the \nprotein to the PET substrate. Although the TmD values of the R132E and R224E mutants were \nslightly lower than that of Is -8p, all three variants showed up to 50% enhance ment in PET \nhydrolysis activity at 50\u00b0C compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further \nenhance the thermal stability of Is -8p, we introduced six new disulfide bonds by creating the \nfollowing double mutants: A171C+S193C (SS2), A202C+V211C (SS3), N73C+A102C (SS4), \nA80C+V149C (SS5), T195C+R224C (SS6), and N275C+F284C (SS7). Among these, SS4, SS5, \nand SS6 had decreased TmD values compared with Is -8p, implying that disulfide bonds were \nnot formed in these mutants (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, SS2, SS3, and SS7 \nincreased TmD values by approximately 4\u00b0C, suggesting that these disulfide bonds were indeed \npresent in Is -8p (Fig. 2a , Supplementary Fig. 1). The PET hydrolysis activity of  the SS 2 \nmutation increased by 20%, whereas that of SS3 and SS 7 mutations slightly decreased \ncompared with Is-8p at 50\u00b0C (Fig. 2a). The wobbling W185 residue is known to be crucial for \nboth enzyme activity and protein stability. 26 Because S214 is located in the vicinity of this \nresidue, we replaced S214 with 19 other residues to identify the optimal residue in terms of \nenzyme activity and protein stability . Although PET hydrolysis activity decreased compared \nwith that of Is -8p in all cases, thermal stability  was improved in several of the new variants  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In particular, the TmD value of S214Y was 6.5 \u00b0C higher than \nthat of Is-8p (Fig. 2a). \nModification of Is -8p enabled us to  identify seven mutation points that improved \nthermal stability, enhanced PET hydrolysis activity, or had other complementary effects. Next, \nwe combined multiple mutations to design a total of nine combinatorial variants of Is -8p, \nincluding six balance -directed variants (Is -8pCom1\u2013Is-8pCom6) and three stability -directed \nvariants (Is-8pCom7\u2013Is-8pCom9) (Table 1). All six balance-directed variants exhibited enhanced \nactivities against both p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB) and PET, along with either increased \n(Is-8pCom1, Is-8pCom5, and Is-8pCom6) or decreased ( Is-8pCom2, Is-8pCom3, and Is-8pCom4) TmD \nvalues compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 1). All three stability-directed \nvariants increased TmD values compared with Is-8p but decreased enzyme activity (Fig. 2b\u2013d \nand Supplementary  Fig. 1). These results i ndicate that the combinatorial variants were \ngenerated in the intended directions, and we selected the Is-8pCom6 (Z1-PETase) and Is-8pCom9 \n(Z2-PETase) variants as the final balance- and stability-directed variants, respectively (Fig. 2b\u2013\nd). Z2-PETase with a TmD value of 86\u00b0C has much higher thermostability than Z1-PETase with \na TmD value of 74\u00b0C; conversely, Z1-PETase showed a 50% increase in PET hydrolysis activity \nwhile Z2-PETase showed somewhat decreased activity, compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b, d). \n \nStructural interpretation of the engineered mutants \n The crystal structure of Z2 -PETase provides a structural explanation of the effects of \nthe introduced mutations in this study  (Supplementary Table. 3). We identified two disulfide \nbonds of IsPETase wild-type, i.e., SS1Ori and SS2Ori, in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3). The four mutated \nresidues in Is-4p, namely, S121E, D186H, S242T, and N246D , were found to be located at \nidentical positions as those in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Table. 1).

Three \nmutations, i.e., N37D, R132E, and R224E, resulted in a large change in the protein surface \ncharge to negative, and in fact, the pI values of wild-type and Z2-PETase were 9.44 and 7.54, \nrespectively. The charge change occurs far from the active site, likely facilitating the adsorption \nof the enzyme to the PET substrate and thereby increasing PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and \nSupplementary Fig. 7). The four new disulfide bonds (SS1, SS2, SS3, and SS7) that were formed \nafter the introduction of mutations stabilized the periphery of each disulfide-formed region in \nZ2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Supplementary  Figs. 8 and 9). Although the length of SS3 was 2.3 \u00c5, \nwhich was slightly longer than the optimal length of a disulfide bond, the other three disulfide \nbonds were within the optimal disulfide bond length range (Supplementary Fig. 8). The S214Y \nmutation stabilized the region surrounding the wobbling W185; however, the S214Y mutation \nappears to interfere with the dynamics of W185, resulting in a dramatic decrease in PET \nhydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9).  \n \nEvaluation of variants in a product-deficient system \nWe compared Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase to identify the most superb IsPETase variant. \nThe stability -directed variant Z2-PETase was much more thermostable  than the balance -\ndirected variant Z1-PETase; \uf044TmD between the two variants was found to be 1 2\u00b0C (Fig. 2b)."

Thus, to compare PET hydrolysis by Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase \nover a broad range of temperatures, we designed a product-deficient in-situ dialysis system to \nmaintain the pH at 8.0 and keep the level of hydrolysis products low. This system was applied \nto PET hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 10), which showed that the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Z1-PETase was higher than that of Z2-PETase across the entire temperature range \nfrom 30\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C, although the optimal temperatures of these two variants were different (Fig. \n4c\u2013f). These results suggest that maintaining or enhancing the high activity of mesophilic PET \nhydrolase is critical for the development of a high-performance PET hydrolase with enhanced \nthermostability, and consequentially, we selected Z1-PETase as the IsPETase variant with the \nhighest PET depolymerizing activity among the tested combinatorial variants.  \nWe then compared the PET depolymerizing activity of Z1-PETase with those of other \nengineered PET hydrolases such as LC-CICCG, Dura-PETase, and Fast-PETase, and surprisingly, \nZ1-PETase kinetically outperforms LC-CICCG and Dura-PETase at all temperatures tested and \nexhibits high depolymerization rates (76.9%\u201390.1%) (Fig. 4c\u2013f). Fast -PETase exhibited a \nslightly faster lag phase than  Z1-PETase at 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C; however, activity decreased \ndramatically at 50\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C, which was consistent with the much lower thermostability of \nFast-PETase (64\u00b0C)20 than Z1-PETase (Fig. 4c -f). Interestingly, the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Dura-PETase was much lower than that of Z1-PETase at all temperature ranges (Fig. \n4c-f), although the thermostability of these IsPETase variants was similar. These results further \nemphasize the importance of maintaining or enhancing mesophilic PET hydrol ysis activity \nduring the development of high-performance PET hydrolases.  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The lag phase of film decomposition was much longer \nthan that of powder decomposition at the same temperature (Fig. 4 d, e, g), suggesting that the \navailability of the PET surface for enzyme adsorption determines the initial depolymerization \nrate. \n \nDepolymerization of post-consumer PET powder using a pH-stat bioreactor  \nWe evaluated the industrial application of Z1-PETase by studying  PET plastic \ndepolymerization using a pH-stat bioreactor. We used transparent post-consumer PET powder \noriginated from transparent PET flakes collected in Daegu, Korea as the substrate (Fig. 5a and \nSupplementary Fig. 11). When the bioreactor was operated at 40\u00b0C under the pH-8.0 stationary \ncondition with 2.5% (w/v) of the substrate, 50% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 8 h, \nand 92.5% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 24 h  (Fig. 5b) . At 55\u00b0C, the initial \ndepolymerization rate was much higher than that at 40\u00b0C, demonstrating the thermal effect on \nPET degradation. At 55\u00b0C, 50% and 93% of the PET powder were depolymerized in 2 h and 8 \nh, respectively  (Fig. 5b).  This corresponds to a specific productivity value of 5.2 \ngmonomer\u2219l\u22121\u2219h\u22121\u2219\u03bcmolenzyme\u22121, with a maximum rate of 17.2 gmonomer\u2219l\u22121\u2219h\u22121\u2219\u03bcmolenzyme\u22121 observed \nin the early phase of the reaction. Due to the high activity and stability of Z1-PETase, the final \ndepolymerization rates of PET powder at 40\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C were not significantly different from \neach other (Fig. 5b).  \nIt should be noted  that colored PET plastics, such as brown plastic  beer bottles, are \ndifficult to recycle because they contain impurities, such as pigments, nylon and iron.

At both temperatures, the final \ndepolymerization rate of colored PET was 90.2%, which was  slightly lower than th at of \ntransparent PET, possibly due to impurities contained in colored PET (Fig. 5d).  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We hypothesized that the mesophilic \nbehavior of IsPETase is primarily due to its good accessibility combined with heat lability and \nthat the reaction rate could therefore be maximized if both activity and stability are optimized; \nbut these properties could be conflicting in  the mechanism of  cold-adapted enzymes . The \nsoluble protein yield  is an aspect of protein production  that is critical for application at an \nindustrial level. Thus, we simultaneously considered three crucial factors, namely, enzyme \nactivity, thermostability, and protein folding,  to develop a potent PET hydrolase variant and \ndesigned a balance-directed protein engineering strategy through non-negative and \ncomplementary accumulation . The balance -directed variant Z1-PETase and the stability -\ndirected variant Z2-PETase highlight the importance of considering the above criteria for \ndeveloping and evaluating enzymes suitable for creating an efficient PET degradation system. \n  \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
