The fuchsia part in the surface of\nHFBI represents a hydrophobic patch, which provides strong hydro-\nphobic interactions and is how HFBI binds to various hydrophobic\nsurfaces\n53. For PETase, the portion circled in the structure is the active\nsite, which is much broader than those of the other PET hydrolases;\nthis active site may explain why PETase can accommodate a large\nsubstrate, such as PET, at moderate temperatures\n15,16.F i g u r e1bs h o w sa\nschematic diagram of our codisplay system. The anchoring proteins\nGCW51 and GCW61 were used to display PETase and HFBI on the yeast\nsurface, respectively. A\ufb02exible linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was employed\nto link the corresponding anchoring protein with PETase and HFBI\nseparately to prevent interference from occuring between each\nanchoring protein and its displaying target\n54. To explore the structural\ndifference between wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase, the\ncrystal structures of those two proteins were determined at 2.0 \u00c5\n(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Table 1) and 1.5 \u00c5\n(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1), respectively. We compared the\nstructure of wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase and found\nthat the tertiary structures of these two proteins were quite similar,\nwith an overall RMSD of 0.352 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In the\nstructure of linker-attached PETase, we can only see a part of the linker\n(6 amino acids) in the form of an irregular structure, indicating that the\n(GGGGS)\n2 linker is \ufb02exible. This result is consistent with previous\n\ufb01ndings that the GGGGS sequence is the most widely used\ufb02exible\nlinker that can appropriately separate the functional domains55.T h e\ncatalytic centers of these two proteins were compared as well. As\nshown in Fig.1d, the two active-site pockets were almost identical. The\nabove results revealed that the C-terminal fused linker did not induce\nobvious structural changes in PETase. To validate our structural\ufb01nd-\nings, we also performed molecular dynamics (MD) studies for the\ncodisplayed PETase and HFBI (Fig.1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). In the\nsimulation, the (GGGGS)\n2 linker showed high\ufb02exibility, and no unique\nstructure was observed when the linker-attached PETase was displayed\nby the yeast cell-wall protein GCW51. Moreover, this\ufb02exible linker\nseparated PETase from GCW51 in space, meaning that the two func-\ntional units did not affect each other.\nTheoretically, our codisplay system should perform dual func-\ntions that mimic the two-step process of PET degradation\n23,24.T h e\ufb01rst\nfunction, which is derived from the HFBI part, is the ability to self-\nassemble and facilitate the binding of yeast cells onto the hydrophobic\nPET surface. The second function, which is inherited from PETase, is to\nenzymatically degrade the highly crystallized substrate PET.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 2\nSupplementary Fig. 3 shows the Western blot (WB) results of both\nPETase and HFBI at different induction times. Positive bands on the WB\n\ufb01lm indicated that both proteins were successfully expressed in the\nrecombinant yeast. To further demonstrate that HFBI and PETase were\nsuccessfully displayed on the yeast cell surface, an immunolocalization\nassay was performed. A\ufb02ag tag was introduced to the N-terminus of\nPETase as a response to the detection of anti-\ufb02ag antibodies. For the\ndisplayed HFBI, a monoclonal antibody against HFBI was used in the\nimmuno\ufb02uorescence assay.

No obvious signals were detected from\nthe protoplast fraction, regardless of the codisplay and display system.\nAll the above results con\ufb01rmed that both proteins were displayed on\nthe yeast cell surface, as expected. In addition, the intensity of\ufb02uor-\nescence was increased with increasing induction time, and the amount\nof surface-displayed HFBI was greater than that of the surface-\ndisplayed PETase when the induction time was less than 96 h\n(Fig. 1g). These results indicated that induction time played an\nimportant role in the levels of PETase and HFBI expression on the cell\nsurface\n34.\nAfter we obtained the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed\nPETase and HFBI, we were eager to know whether the displayed PETase\nmaintained its enzymatic activity when it was codisplayed with\nhydrophobin HFBI. Figure1h shows the degradation products released\nby the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed PETase and HFBI by\nusing hcPET as the substrate. The major product released by the dis-\nplayed PETase was mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET),\nand trace amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-\nTPA (BHET) were detected at the same time. The ratio between the\nliberated products of displayed PETase and that of the native PETase\nwas almost the same (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Together, these results\nindicated that the displayed PETase was biologically active and\nexhibited the same reaction mechanism as that of native PETase,\ncleaving the polymer preferentially at similar positions\n14,56.\nThe turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was calculated by\nquantitatively analyzing the high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) results from Fig.1h. The standard curve of each released pro-\nduct was calculated to accurately measure the amount of each product\n(Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c). A semiquantitative WB method was then\nused to estimate how much PETase was displayed in the yeast cells. We\n\ufb01rst generated a standard curve of wild-type PETase by performing\ngrayscale analysis with the WB results (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).\nSubsequently, yeast cells (at 48 h induction) were subjected to the\nsame WB analysis to detect the displayed PETase (Supplementary\nFig. 6c). According to the standard curve, 151.2 ng of PETase in a total\nof 2 \u00d7 10\n7 displayed yeast cells. For the Codisplay system, 2 \u00d7 107 cells\ncontained 35.2 ng of displayed PETase. As shown in Fig.1ia n dS u p -\nplementary Fig. 7, the turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was\ndramatically affected by the induction time and the ratio between HFBI\nand PETase that was displayed on the cell surface. The ratio reached a\nmaximum value at the induction time of 48 h when the ratio between\nHFBI and PETase displayed on the cell surface also reached its max-\nimum. The above results revealed that the amount of HFBI on the cell\nsurface exhibited an obvious impact on the enzymatic activity of the\ndisplayed PETase\n57.\nIn our codisplay system, PETase is theoretically responsible for\ndegrading the substrate PET. To con\ufb01rm that surface-displayed HFBI\ndoes not degrade PET as well, three surface display systems were\nconstructed, including the PETase (S160A)/HFBI codisplay system,\nlinker-GCW51 (removing PETase)/HFBI codisplay system and HFBI\nsingle-display system, which are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a-c.\nEnzymatic analysis of each surface display system revealed that none\nof the displayed systems constructed above exhibited PET degradation\nactivity, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e), suggesting that\nPETase performed an enzymatic function rather than hydrophobin on\nthe surface of yeast cells.\nSurface-displayed HFBI can increase the adsorption of codis-\nplayed cells on PET surfaces by improving their surface\nhydrophobicity\nIn the above study, we con\ufb01rmed the surface expression of hydro-\nphobin HFBI. Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) and water\ncontact angle (WCA) measurements were performed to verify whe-\nther the displayed HFBI could induce alterations in the surface\nhydrophobicity of the recombinant yeast cells. MATH is a classical\ntechnique for determining the surface hydrophobicity of various\ncells\n58,59. This method involves examining the adhesion of cells to\nliquid hydrocarbons (e.g., n-butanol, p-xylene), as this adhesion is\ndirectly associated with the hydrophobic surface properties of cells\n(Fig. 2a)\n60. As shown in Fig.2b, all yeast cells in the control group\n(without induction) remained in the lower aqueous phase, indicating\nthat the cell surface properties were hydrophilic. As induction time\nincreased, the yeast cells that codisplayed PETase and HFBI gradually\nmoved into the upper oil phase, causing a concomitant loss in tur-\nbidity throughout the lower aqueous phase. The relative hydro-\nphobicity of the cell surface de \ufb01ned in the Methods section\ncontinued to increase with the induction time and reached a max-\nimum at 96 h (Fig.2c). To further demonstrate that the increase in\ncell surface hydrophobicity was mainly due to the surfaced-displayed\nHFBI, a MATH assay was conducted by using yeast cells that dis-\nplayed only PETase. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows that yeast cells with\nonly PETase remained in the lower aqueous phase within the entire\ninduction time. Together, these results demonstrated that the dis-\nplayed HFBI was responsible for the increase in the codisplayed cell\nhydrophobicity.\nWCA is another commonly used method to measure the surface\nhydrophobicity of tested cells\n61. After performing high-density cell\nmodi\ufb01cations, the WCA of the hcPET\ufb01lm can be determined by\nexamining the cell surface properties. As shown in Fig.2d, e, the hcPET\n\ufb01lm displayed a typical hydrophobic property (WCA is 85\u00b0). After\nmodi\ufb01cations were performed with yeast cells that codisplayed PETase\na n dH F B I( 4 8hi n d u c t i o n ) ,t h eW C Ao ft h eh c P E T\ufb01lm slightly changed\nfrom 85\u00b0 to 73\u00b0, indicating the codisplayed yeast cells exhibited a\nhydrophobic surface property. To clarify the contribution of the dis-\nplayed HFBI to the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed yeast cells, the\nWCA of yeast cells displaying only PETase was also determined. The\nhydrophilic property (WCA is 37\u00b0) of the PETase-displayed cell con-\n\ufb01rmed that the HFBI part played an essential role in determining the\ncell surface hydrophobicity. Together, these results veri\ufb01ed that by\nexposing its hydrophobic patch on the protein surface, the displayed\nHFBI can indeed increase the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed\ncells\n43\u201346.\nTo determine whether the effect of displayed HFBI on cell\nhydrophobicity can be transformed into an effect on the attachment of\nyeast cells on the PET surface, we observed the adsorption of the\nFig. 1 | Protein expression and function ofP. pastorisGS115/PETase-HFBI at\ndifferent induction times. aX-ray crystal structure of the amphiphilic hydro-\nphobin HFBI (the hydrophobic patch is marked in red) and PETase (blue indicates\npositive charge, red indicates negative charge, and the dotted line indicates active\npocket position).b Schematic diagram of the codisplay system.c The overall\nstructure of PETase-linker (the red arrow is marked as Linker).d Catalytic triad\ncomparison of wild-type PETase with PETase-linker.e MD simulations of the\ncodisplay system over 100 ns.

It was quite clear that the binding num-\nbers of the HFBI-displaying yeast cells on the hcPET surface were\napproximately twice that of the control group at each tested condition.\nThe adsorption differences between the codisplay cells and cells dis-\nplaying only PETase on the surface lcPET could also be observed,\nregardless of the concentration of yeast cells in the binding assays\n(Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). The number of HFBI-displaying yeast cells\nadsorbed on the lcPET surface was approximately twice that of the\ncontrol group under each tested condition (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d).\nWe believe that the similar surface hydrophobicity of hcPET and lcPET\nresulted in similar experimental results (Supplementary Fig. 12) by\nWCA. To further verify the role of HFBI in the codisplay system, we\ndesigned a codisplay system in which only hydrophobin was removed\nand the other parts remained unchanged. Supplementary Fig. 13a\nshows that both liker-GCW61 and PETase were successfully displayed\non the surface of yeast cells. Then, we tested the enzymatic degrada-\ntion performance against hcPET and lcPET, and we found that the\ncodisplay system without hydrophobin exhibited a greatly reduced\ndegradation ability toward both hcPET and lcPET compared with that\nof the normal codisplay system (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c). In addi-\ntion, the adsorption capacity of this system on the PET substrate was\nreduced to approximately half of the original value (Supplementary\nFig. 14). These results clearly revealed that the adhesive unit HFBI was\nparticularly important for the codisplay system to exhibit a high\ndegradation capacity to PET. Taken together, all these results con-\n\ufb01rmed that hydrophobin HFBI displayed on the yeast cell surface\nintroduced the extra binding capacity to the yeast cell on the PET\nsurface.\nThe codisplay system exhibited extraordinary enzymatic activ-\nity against PET\nWe then explored the optimal conditions of the codisplay cells for\nhcPET hydrolysis and compared the results with those of puri\ufb01ed\nPETase. Figure3a and Supplementary Fig. 15a show that temperature\nexhibited an obvious in\ufb02uence on the turnover rates for both the\ncodisplay cells and native PETase. The codisplay cells exhibited an\nenhanced enzymatic activity compared with that of native PETase at\neach tested temperature condition. The optimal reaction temperature\nwas 40 \u00b0C, similar to native PETase, indicating that the codisplay cells\nremained in a heat-labile degradation system\n14. Since high temperature\ncan promote the chain mobility of PET to accelerate its enzymatic\ndegradation, a heat stabilizing unit could be introduced into the cur-\nrent surface display system to further improve its degradation ef\ufb01-\nciency in the future\n18.F i g u r e3b and Supplementary Fig. 15b shows the\neffect of pH on the turnover rates of the codisplay cells. The maximum\nturnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9, similar to\nnative PETase. At other pH conditions, the codisplay cells exhibited\nmuch higher turnover rates than those of native PETase. For example,\nboth yeast cells displaying only PETase (Supplementary Fig. 16) and\nnative PETase were almost inactive at pH 10. However, the codisplay\ncells maintained more than 50% of their total enzyme activity, indi-\ncating that their alkaline tolerance was signi\ufb01cantly improved. The\nsurface-displayed HFBI may contribute to this result since HFBI is very\nstable at extreme pH conditions and can even resist protease degra-\ndation in vitro\n44,62\u201364. The increased tolerance of the codisplay cells to\nalkaline environments can facilitate the PET pretreatment process65.\nWe then explored whether the cell number of codisplay cells\nin\ufb02uenced their turnover rate. Figure3c shows that the turnover rate\nfor the codisplay cells was at its maximum (2146.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 sec\u22121)a n d\nremained constant when the protein concentration was less than\n1.3 nM. When the protein concentration exceeded 1.3 nM, the con-\nversion rates decreased rapidly. This result revealed that there the\ndisplayed PETase on the yeast surface might be optimal, which cor-\nresponded to the maximum PET surface-reaching of the displayed\nenzyme molecules. Additional displayed PETase molecules sterically\nhindered the PET surface and appeared inactive, leading to a\ndecrease in the turnover rate of the codisplay cells. The native\nPETase and the display cells faced similar situations as the codisplay\nsystem, and the turnover rate reached maximum values (6.5 \u00d7 10\n\u22125\nand 227.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 sec\u22121) when the protein concentrations were 370 nM\nand 11.3 nM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16c and Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 17). Finally, we found that the maximum turnover rate of the\ncodisplay cells was strikingly 328.8-fold higher than that of native\nPETase (Fig.3d).\nThen, we performed both SEM and optical microscopy to observe\nthe morphological changes in the codisplay cell-treated hcPET\ufb01lm. At\nthe same time, we used native PETase-treated\ufb01lms as controls. As\nshown in Fig.3e, there was almost no surface erosion on the PETase-\ntreated hcPET\ufb01lm, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of native\nPETase against hcPET was rather low. In contrast, apparent cracks and\nerosion on the PET surface were observed by SEM when the yeast cells\nthat codisplayed HFBI and PETase were applied to hcPET. Microscopic\nobservation of cross-sections of the PET\ufb01lms was also performed to\nfurther evaluate the degradation results of our codisplay system. As\nshown in Fig.3f-g and Supplementary Fig. 18, almost no change in the\nthickness of the PETase-treated hcPET\ufb01lm was observed. A small but\nobvious reduction in thickness (~3.2%) was observed when our codis-\nplayed yeast cells degraded the hcPET\ufb01lm.\nTo further verify the functionality of the codisplay system, the\nenzymatic activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst toward a commercially\navailable lcPET (PET-GF, crystallinity of 6.3%) was also measured.\nConsidering that the degradation substrate was changed, we opti-\nmized the degradation conditions of both the codisplay cells and\npuri\ufb01ed PETase for lcPET. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 19 and\nSupplementary Fig. 20, several reaction conditions, including tem-\nperature, pH, and cell number, caused obvious effects on the turnover\nrates of the codisplay cells and puri\ufb01ed PETase. The optimal reaction\ntemperature remained at 40 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 19a), and the\nmaximum turnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9,\nsimilar to native PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19b). These results were\nsimilar to those obtained by using hcPET as the degradation substrate.\nT h et u r n o v e rr a t ef o rt h ec o d i s p l a yc e l l sr e a c h e di t sm a x i m u m\n(2909.3 \u00d7 10\n\u22122 sec\u22121) when the normalized PETase concentration was\n0.65 nM. In contrast, the turnover rate of puri\ufb01ed lcPET reached a\nmaximum value (5.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 sec\u22121) when the protein concentration was\n181.4 nM (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Accordingly, the maximum turn-\nover rate of the codisplay cells against lcPET was 519.5-fold higher than\nthat of the puri\ufb01ed PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19d).\nSupplementary Fig. 21 shows the morphological changes in the\ncodisplay cell-treated lcPET\ufb01lm, as observed by SEM and optical\nmicroscopy. Obvious erosion spots were observed on the surface of\nlcPET, which is consistent with the results of hcPET degradation,\nindicating that the results were statistically signi\ufb01cant. In addition, it\ncan be seen from the SEM results that the PET\ufb01lms degraded by the\ncodisplay system were full of round pits with a size of ~5 microns,\nwhich was basically consistent with the size of yeast cells. These results\nrevealed that yeast cells adsorbed on the PET surface and then exerted\nenzyme activity, as seen in the adsorption experiment (Supplementary\nFig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11). The puri\ufb01ed PETase contained small\ncorrosion spots locally and was very small. This result indicated that\nthe codisplay system could ef\ufb01ciently degrade lcPET and hcPET.\nIn addition, we tested the crystallinity of lcPET and hcPET before\nand after degradation at different temperatures using the codisplay\nsystem, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 22. For lcPET, it can be seen\nthat the crystallinity increases with increasing conversion level, indi-\ncating that PETase degraded amorphous PET in the codisplay system.\nHowever, the crystallinity of the PET\ufb01lm treated with the system\nwithout enzyme at different temperatures did not change obviously\ncompared with that of the control group, indicating that the\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 6\nCodisplay\nPETase\n20 30 40 50\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\na\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n600\n1200\n1800\n2400\n234567 89 1 0\nCodisplay\nPETase\npH\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\nb\nCodisplay\nPETase\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\nProtein concentration (nM)\n61 2 18 1000 2000 3000\n3701.30\n123456\n0\n600\n1200\n1800\n2400\n1.30\nc\ne\nCommercial hcPET\nControl PETase Codisplay\nf\nControl PETase\nCodisplay\nCommercial hcPET\n(Crystallinity 45%)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\nCodisplay PETase\nTurnover rate (x 10-5 sec-1)\n0\n1\n300\n320\n340\nRelative activity (Fold)\n2146\n329\n6.5\n1\nd\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n175.4 175.2 170.1\nControl PETase Codisplay\nFilm thickness (\u03bcm)\ng\nFig. 3 | Optimization of the degradation system and visualization of hcPET\ufb01lm\ndegradation. aEffect of temperature,b pH, andc protein concentration on PET\nhydrolysis.n = 3 independent experiments.

The change in crystallinity observed in the experiment\nwas mainly caused by enzyme digestion. The same results can also be\nobserved in hcPET samples, except that the crystallinity decreases with\nincreasing PET degradation, which suggested that the codisplay sys-\ntem exhibited no selectivity for PET hydrolysis. At the same time, the\nchange in temperature did not affect the crystallinity of the hcPET\ufb01lm,\nindicating that the change in crystallinity of PET was also caused by\nPETase.\nFinally, we compared the turnover rate based on the total pro-\nducts of MHET, TPA, and BHET for the puri\ufb01ed PETase, yeast cells\nthat displayed only PETase, and those with codisplay at the optimal\ncondition using lcPET (Supplementary Fig. 23a) and hcPET (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 23b) as substrates. The conversion levels of hcPET and\nlcPET within 18 h at 30 \u00b0C were ~3.0% (depolymerization rate of 3.27\nmg\nproducts h\u22121 mgenzyme\n\u22121) and 55% (depolymerization rate of 178.15\nmgproducts h\u22121 mgenzyme\n\u22121), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 24).\nThe codisplay whole-cell biocatalyst system is robust and\nef\ufb01cient\nIt is expected that the codisplay cells will be used as whole-cell bio-\ncatalysts on an industrial scale; therefore, several properties related\nto industrial applications of the codisplay cells were evaluated,\nincluding thermal stability, reusability, chemical or solvent stability,\nstorage conditions, and long-term enzymatic activity. Figure 4a\nshows that the relative turnover rate of the codisplay cells remained\nat 100% when the cells were placed at 30 \u00b0C for 7 days, indicating that\nthe enzyme activity was almost unchanged during this incubation\ntime. Free PETase lost 40% of its original hydrolytic activity after\n1 day of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, and its enzyme activity was completely\nlost on the\ufb01fth day. These results revealed that the codisplay cells\nexhibited considerably higher thermostability\n66,67. This is one intrin-\nsic advantage of the surface display system68,69. Sanna et al. reported\nthat native HFBI did not degrade at 30 \u00b0C for 18 h62. Therefore, the\nexcellent thermostability of HFBI might play a role in the thermo-\nstability of the codisplay cells. Then, the reusability of the codisplay\ncells was investigated.\nAs shown in Fig.4b, the codisplay cells retained 85% of the ori-\nginal turnover rate after three rounds of use and 50% after seven\ncycles. There are two possible reasons for the decline in the turnover\nrate. The\ufb01rst reason is that cells are inevitably lost in the recycling\nprocess. The second reason is that the degradation products might\noccupy the catalytic pocket of the displayed PETase and inhibit its\nactivities to some extent\n70. Next, we determined whether the pre-\nsence of organic solvents or detergents would affect the turnover\nrate of codisplay cells due to the pretreatment process of PET, which\noften involves these chemicals. Figure4c shows that the turnover\nrate toward hcPET retained 98, 82, and 72% when the codisplay cells\nwere incubated in the tested solutions that contained 0.1% Triton X-\n100, 10% methanol, and 10% ethanol, respectively. Compared with\nthe yeast cells that displayed PETase, the codisplay cells showed a\nhigher turnover rate at each test chemical solution\n34. For example,\nthe turnover rate of yeast cells that displayed PETase remained at just\n50% in 0.1% Triton X-100 solution\n34. The chemical stability of the\ncodisplay cells is bene\ufb01cial to the PET pretreatment processes, such\nas cleaning71. It is well known that hydrophobin can maintain its\nfunctional activity under extreme conditions42. Hence, the chemical\nstability of hydrophobin HFBI may be related to the stability of the\ncodisplay cells in the chemical solutions. Finally, the turnover rate of\nthe whole-cell biocatalyst was evaluated before and after lyophiliza-\ntion, which is a dehydration process that facilitates the storage and\ntransport of codisplay cells\n72. Supplementary Fig. 25 shows that the\nturnover rate of the codisplay cells toward PET remained nearly 100%\nafter freeze-drying, suggesting that the whole-cell biocatalyst\nretained almost total enzymatic activity after the dehydration\nprocess. Therefore, lyophilization is considered a storage option for\nthe future use of whole-cell biocatalysts.\nNext, we applied the codisplay cells to degrade commercial PET\nbottles. Figure4d shows that the whole-cell biocatalyst can ef\ufb01ciently\ndegrade different highly crystallized PET bottles. According to a pre-\nvious method\n13, we calculated the conversion level of the codisplay\ncells against the highly crystallized PET bottles used in our study. As\ns h o w ni nT a b l e1, the conversion levels were 3.1, 3.1, and 2.8% for\nNestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi PET bottles, respectively. In Yoshida\u2019s\npaper, the conversion level of native PETase against hcPET was\n~0.0097%\n14. Compared to native PETase, the codisplay cells exhibited\nmuch higher degradation ef\ufb01ciency in the highly crystallized PET\nbottles. All were consistent with the conversion levels for hcPET and\nlcPET. The conversion level of the codisplay system was 3 and 55%\ntoward hcPET and lcPET, respectively, which was consistent with pre-\nvious microscopic observations. We also summarized and calculated\nthe conversion levels of several reported PETase mutants using the\nsame procedure in the Methods section (Table1). Clearly, the codis-\nplay system showed the best conversion level under 18 h for both high-\nand low-crystallinity PET. Finally, to evaluate the long-term function-\nality of the designed whole-cell biocatalyst, we used the codisplay\nsystem to degrade hcPET for 10 days. As shown in Fig.4e, f, the total\nproducts and relative conversion levels of hcPET in both the codisplay\nsystem and the display system increased with time and reached a\nmaximum around the ninth day, which was 10.9 and 1.2%, respectively.\nHowever, the degradation activity of wild-type PETase for hcPET was\nvery low, and the conversion level was only 0.003%. These results\nshowed that by establishing the codisplay system, the stability of\nPETase increases.\nAlthough the conversion level of codisplay cells against the\ncommercial bottles was the highest ever reported for any degradation\nsystem using PETase to our knowledge, there is still much room for\nimprovement. For example, we can screen and test more adhesive\nunits to further improve the binding of the yeast cell onto the PET\nsurface. By doing so, we hope that the codisplay system can be applied\nin the large-scale biological recycling of PET in the future.\nMolecular insights into the two-step degradation of PET by the\ncodisplay system\nTo explore how membrane-anchored HFBI/PETase engaged PET\nchains and how these interactions facilitated the subsequent cleavage\nof PET, all-atom MD simulations were performed. MD simulation has\nbeen adopted by several researchers to investigate the interactions\nbetween wild-type or mutant PETase and their substrate PET in soluble\nstates\n11,73\u201377. In the preequilibrated system (0 ns), randomly distributed\n4PET did not interact with the active center of PETase or the hydro-\nphobic region of HFBI (Fig.5a, Supplementary Fig. 26, and Supple-\nmentary Movies 1, 2). Over time, 4PET gradually aggregated near the\nhydrophobic amino acids of HFBI at ~40\u201350 ns. At ~60\u201370 ns, 4PET\ncompletely attached to the hydrophobic patch of HFBI, which occur-\nred mainly through the interaction of hydrophobic residues, and\nremained mostly bound for the rest of the trajectory. During this\nperiod, 4PET began to gather near the active center of PETase; even-\ntually, a number of 4PET molecules were gathered at ~100 ns. Calcu-\nlation of the distances between 4PET and the other two proteins\nagreed with the possible role of HFBI in the local enrichment of PETs\n(Supplementary Fig. 27). From the simulated trajectories, we postu-\nlated that our codisplay system completed PET degradation through\ntwo-step processes involving adsorption and hydrolysis, wherein the\nhydrophobin HFBI favorably binds to the PET chains and grabs the\nchains \ufb01rmly (Fig.5b); then, PETase interacts with PET and performs a\nhydrolysis function (Fig.5c).\nNext, to delineate the interaction between PETase-linker-\nGCW51 and hcPET and to elucidate whether PETase-linker-GCW51\nfollows a conformational selection or induced-\ufb01t mechanism, we\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34908-z\nNature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 8\na\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\n12345 67\nDays\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\nCodisplay\nPETase\n1 234567\nCycles\nCodisplay\nb\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 1234 5 67 89 10 11\nNative PETase\nDisplay\nCodisplay\nhcPET\nRelative degradation (%)\nTimes (d)\nf\nc\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Relative turnover rate (%)\nControl TritonControl Methanol Ethanol\nChemical/Solvent conditions\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000Released MHET (nmoles)\nd\nNestl\u00e9 Coca-Cola Pepsi Unknown\n966 948 878\n3\nCommercial PET bottles\ne\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n01 2 3 4 5 678 9 10\nTimes (d)\nTotal products (\u03bcmoles)\nNative PETase\nDisplay\nCodisplay\nFig. 4 | The stability and functionality of the codisplay system. aThe thermo-\nstability of GS115/PETase-HFBI and puri\ufb01ed PETase.b Effect of recycling times byP.\npastoris GS115/PETase-HFBI.c Effect of chemical/solvent conditions onP. pastoris\nGS115/PETase-HFBI and GS115/PETase-GCW51.d Degradation of commercial PET\nbottles with the whole-cell biocatalyst.

Our results\nnot only provide an ef\ufb01cient strategy for ef\ufb01ciently biodegrading\nhcPET but also demonstrate the plasticity of the surface display\nsystem. By introducing different functional modules into the\nsurface display system, its performance can be greatly improved.\nIn the future, more functional units, such as MHETase, that can\nhydrolyze MHET to PET reagen ts can be introduced into the\nwhole-cell biocatalyst system to further enhance its performance."
