      "text": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: 369 \nMutCompute19 is a 3D CNN model where the architecture consists of nine la yers divided into two 370 \nblocks: 1) feature extraction and 2) classification. The feature extraction block consisted of six layers: 371 \ntwo pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by a dimension reduction max pooling layer after each 372 \npair. The first pair of convolutional layers used filters of size 3x3x3 and the second pair had filters of 373 \nsize 2x2x2. Additionally, the Rectified Linearity Unit function (Relu) was applied to the output of each 374 \nof the four convolutional layers. The final feature maps generated by t he feature extraction block had 375 \ndimensions of size 400x3x3x3. These feature maps were flattened into a 1D vector of size 10,800 376 \nbefore being passed to the classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully 377 \nconnected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2, and 0, respectively. Like the feature extraction 378 \nblock, the output of the first two dense layers was transformed by the Relu function. To obtain a vector 379 \nof 20 probability scores representing the network prediction for each of the amino acids, we applied a 380 \nsoftmax activation function to the output of the third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a 381 \nmachine learning as a service (MLaaS) on https://mutcompute.com.  382 \nMutCompute Predictions: 383 \nMutCompute predictions were obtained by running the wild type PETase (pdb id: 5xjh) and 384 \nthermopetase (pdb id: 6ij6) through our MLaaS at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered by 385 \nsorting by the probability assigned to the wild type amino acid. We filtered 34  and 39 residues from 386 \nthe wild type PETase and Thermopetase crystal structures, respectively. From these filtered residues, 387 \nwe prioritized our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the 10 residues from each crystal structure 388 \nwith the highest log2 fold chan ge between the predicted amino acid and wild type amino acid 389 \nprobabilities.

The 400 \ninitial hits were identified with the rod -shaped crystals formed after incubating screening plates at 401 \n25 \u00b0C for three days. The crystallization was optimized as 0.1 M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M Ammonium Sulfate, 402 \npH 5.5 setup as sitting-drop vapor diffusion.  403 \n 404 \nIndividual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotected with 405 \n30 % (v/v) glycerol. X -ray diffraction data were  collected at 23 -ID-B beamline in Advance Photon 406 \nSource (Lemont, IL). The X -ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44\u00c5 resolution for FAST -407 \nPETase crystals using HKL2000 22. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with 408 \nThermoPETase structure as the initial search model (PDB code 6IJ6 12). The molecular replacement 409 \nsolution for FAST -PETase structure was iteratively buil t and refined using Coot 23 and Phenix 24 410 \nrefinement package. Procheck and MolProbity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST -PETase 411 \nstructure.

To enable e xtracellular expression of PETase and its mutants 420 \nin Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide \u2014421 \nSPpstu (21 amino acids) from maltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-1925 was 422 \nused to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 amino acids) of wild-type PETase. The 423 \nwild-type PETase and its mutants\u2019 genes with SPpstu presented at the N -terminus were amplified by 424 \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 425 \nAssembly method, DNA fragments encoding wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase 426 \nwere respectively subcloned into a modified pBTK552 vector26 where the antibiotic resistance marker 427 \nwas swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a C -terminal hexa-histidine tag-428 \ncoding sequence was added. To enable intracellular expression of LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli 429 \n(DE3) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) , the nucleotide sequence encoding the original signal 430 \npeptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide 431 \nsequence were amplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 432 \nAssembly method, the DNA fragments encoding LCC and ICCM were respectively subcloned into a 433 \ncommercial vector-pET-21b (Novagen, San Diego, CA), which carry a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-434 \ncoding sequence. The electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10\u03b2 was transformed with the Gibson Assembly 435 \nproduct by following a standard electroporation protocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was 436 \nextracted from the overnight culture of the cloning host by using the  QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit 437 \n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA sequence of extracted plasmid was verified by Sanger sequencing. 438 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The constructed plasmids carrying wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase 445 \nand DuraPETase genes were used as the templates for mutagenesis PCR reaction. The corresponding 446 \nprimer sequences and annealing temperature were designed and generated by using the 447 \nNEBaseChanger\u2122 tool. Stellar\u2122 Competent Cells ( Clontech Laboratories,  Mountain View, CA ) 448 \nwere used as the cloning host and transformed with the ligated plasmids using the heat-shock method 449 \nprovided in the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Plasmid extraction and sequencing for the variants were 450 \nperformed under the same conditions as described for plasmids carrying wild-type PETase, 451 \nThermoPETase and DuraPETase genes. 452 \n 453 \nProtein expression and purification 454 \nFor extracellular protein expression of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, and their 455 \nvariants, P. putida  KT2440 was used as the expression host and its e lectrocompetent cell was 456 \ntransformed with the corresponding constructed plasmids. For intracellular protein expression of LCC 457 \nand ICCM, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as the expression host and its electrocompetent cell was 458 \ntransformed with the corresponding constructed plasmids. A single colony of an P. putida KT2440 or 459 \nE. coli BL21 (DE3) strain harboring one of the constructed plasmids was inoculated into 2 mL of Luria 460 \nBertani broth (LB) medium with 50 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C/225 rpm.

Target proteins from the above two type of supernatants were both purified 474 \nby HisPur\u2122 Ni -NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the 475 \nmanufacturer\u2019s instruction. Desalting of the protein eluent was carried out by using Sephadex G-25 476 \nPD-10 columns  (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction . All 477 \npurification and desalting steps were performed at 4\u00b0 C in a cold room.

Chemical shift was referenced to the residual solvent signal ( 1H 645 \nNMR: 7.26 ppm in CDCl3, 2.50 ppm in d6-DMSO, respectively). 646 \nMicroscopic observation of P. putida Go19 and PHAs 647 \nPHAs formation in P. putida Go19 from the simultaneous experiment was microscopically observed 648 \nby using an upright laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM -510, Zeiss) under reflectance using a 649 \n100X, 1.3 NA oil -dipping objective (Zeiss), a ccording to the protocol described by Franden et al.28. 650 \n0.5 mL sample was taken from the simultaneous process experiment of the P. putida Go19 culture 651 \n(with 200 nM of FAST-PETase) that grew on NL-M9 medium supplemented with a circular pc-PET 652 \nfilm (cookie container) as the sole carbon source. Culture was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 3 min, 653 \nfollowed by washing twice with DPBS. Cell pellets were then stained with 1 mL of 10 \u03bcg/mL Nile 654 \nRed (Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and kept in the dark for 30 min at room 655 \ntemperature. Subsequently, the stained cells were pelleted again by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 3 min, 656 \nfollowed by washing twice with DPBS. Finally, the stained cells were resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of DPBS. 657 \n1 ul of the stained cell solution was dipped on a coverslip and pressed with a small coverslip.  The 658 \nsamples were illuminated with a 561 nm laser and reflected light was collected by setting the Meta 659 \ndetector channel between 570-670 nm wavelength. 660"

The 213 \nbest variant, FAST-PETase, exhibits superior activity over a wide range of temperatures (30\u201350 \u2070C), 214 \nand exceptional compatibility with cell-growth conditions. We demonstrate this capacity via the rapid, 215 \nefficient, and complete degradation of bulk, untreated pc-PET waste and a reduction of PET fragments 216 \nembedded in textile fabrics. The properties of this variant are ultimately suitable for both low -cost 217 \nindustrial recycling as well as  for in situ plastic degradation applications, as demonstrate d by 218 \nsimultaneous bioprocessing with P. putida Go 19. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential 219 \nfor structure-based deep learning in protein engineering and the opportunities for converting 220 \nmesophilic enzyme scaffolds into broad-range biocatalysts for a cyclic plastic economy.   221 \npreprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
