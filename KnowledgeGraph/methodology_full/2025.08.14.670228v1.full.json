The array of these plastic pollutants, \nof different sizes and types is also mind- boggling. While the load of plastic pollution keeps \nincreasing, driven by global demand and eventual production, means and methods of plastic \nrecycling are few and far in between and ineffective on a broader perspective. The staggering range \nof the burden is often disturbing. The yearly production of plastic waste has been projected to \nreach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050, according to the study done by World Bank [3]. \nIn an effort to limit the load of plastic pollutants, degradation of plastics using microbial sources \nhas been the subject of study over the past few decades. The polymerization of plastic is effected \nby means of weak forces like van der Waals interactions, electrostatic forces as well as hydrogen \nbonds. etc. Microbes are known to degrade plastics in a sequential manner. Broadly, this can be \nsimplified as physical or chemical deterioration, followed by breakdown of polymers which are \nthen shipped to the cytoplasm of the microbes for metabolic breakdown [3].  \nOne of the biggest sources of the pollution and perhaps the most commonly used of plastics is \nPolyethylene Terephthalate (PET). Microbial biodegradation of PET has been mooted for long and \na few breakthroughs have been achieved over the years. Enzymes from  Thermobifida fusca were \nreported from the early years of this century to be effective in the degradation of PET\n[4]. Lipases \nfrom Candida antarctica [4] and cutinases from Humicola insolens  [5] have also been known to \ndisplay PET degradation, and some of these have been shown to have synergistic effects in \nelevating the efficacy and reducing the time of the degradation process [6].  \nIdeonella sakaiensis, a plastic-degrading bacterium, was first discovered in 2016 [7]. I. sakaiensis \nis a Gram negative, aerobic, rod -shaped bacterium belonging to the genus Ideonella and family \nComamonadaceae [8]. Originally isolated from a sediment sample taken outside of a plastic bottle \nrecycling facility in Sakai, the bacterium also uses PET as a sole carbon and energy source for \ngrowth. The PETase enzyme found in the bacteria aids in the degradation of the ester bond of PET. \nIsPETase (PETase from I. sakaiensis) has demonstrated the highest plastic degradation activity \ncompared to all other bacterial enzymes despite the fact that similar enzymes have been discovered \nin a number of other organisms.  \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The PETase enzymes showed the presence of a conserved, PET-binding active \nsite. Ser (160), Asp (206) and His (237) form a highly conserved catalytic triad that aids in the \nstable binding with PET. Several mutations were introduced into the PETase enzyme of Ideonella \nsakaiensis, and wild- type bacteria were used for comparison.  [6] has also reported that mutant \nIsPETase R280A is 22.4% more effective than the wild type. According to the report, these \nvariants were more effective at higher temperatures and their plastic degradation rate was \nsignificantly higher compared to the wild type, but they are not effectively utilised for refuse \ndegradation [10]. However, wild-type bacteria have certain limitations that prevent large -scale \napplication. IsPETase in its natural state is exceedingly unstable and therefore, IsPETase have also \nbeen modified to degrade PET completely at higher temperatures [11]. \nThe mechanism and high- resolution crystal structure of IsPETase [12]  showed that the enzyme \nhas a hydrophobic cavity that binds to PET polymers and breaks the PET into monomers like bis(2-\nhydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) 13. IsPETase \nthough is incapable of hydrolyzing MHET to terephthalic  acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). \nVery recently, [14] reported that PETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus has comparable binding \naffinity for PET and hydrolysis activity at moderate temperatures. With very few substitutions in \nthe conserved domain, RgPETase was found to be  remarkably similar to IsPETase. These are \nthough, the only two instances of discovery of PET degrading bacteria till date. \nThe discovery of plastic degradation abilities in prokaryotic species is a slow process, and \ndiscoveries are few and far in between. With the knowledge of the available enzymes and the \ncouple of structures that have been solved, we therefore strived to predict the presence of such \nplastic degradation abilities in other bacterial species. The search was manifold, both at the level \nof the sequences and the conservation of the degradation domain. The hits were subjected to in \nsilico verification using structural parameters and docking tools. In this investigation, BHET was \nchosen as the substrate both due to its structural similarity to the nucleus of PET and it\u2019s ability to \nhydrolyze into TPA and EG monomers. The predicted structures and the enzymes shed light on \nthe variety of plastic degradation domains from across the prokaryotes, and also demonstrate th e \nrange of alternatives that could be explored in addition to I. sakaiensis for plastic degradation  \nmediated by bacteria. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Similarly, 56 mutants of PETase from \nI. sakaiensis were filtered to remove any redundancies.

The lowest similarity which was considered \nwas the sequence from Halopseudomonas pertucinogena with a sequence identity of 51.32% and \n98% sequence coverage. Apart from the conserved serine hydrolase motif and the cysteine, the \npresence of a conserved methionine near the serine hydrolase motif was also a hallmark of the 27 \nsequences (supplementary figure S6). \nFurther, the sequence alignment revealed that all the sequences belonged to the type II category of \nPETases, except Proteobacteria bac terium. T ype II PETases are typically characterized by  \nadditional disulphide linkages due to the conserved cysteine residues at positions 203 and 239. \nType II PETases are more efficient in their plastic degradation abilities compared to type I PETases \ndue to the additional disulphide bonds and certain substitutions in the subsite 2 (supplementary \nfigure S6) [6]. \nDomain identification using MotifScan with the Pfam dataset revealed the presence of the esterase \ndomain acetyl xylene esterase (AXE) across all the 27 sequences. The AXE domain was identified \nat position 123 to 155 in I. sakaiensis exhibiting an E value of 0.00049 and belonging to the \npfam_FS family. The Pfam FS is a database of complete sequences, encompassing the full \ndiversity of proteins, to reveal maximum identification. The AXE domain, identified by Pfam FS, \nis typified by a Ser at position 160, a Met at 161 and four consecutive Gly residues after the M161 \n(supplementary figure S7 and S8) and this was used for all further analyses. \nIn the analysis of 27 hits, the amino acid composition inside the domain exhibited alterations at \n31% (283 out of 918) of the assessed sites, with substitutions being the primary alteration. \nDeletions were noted (supplementary table 2) in merely 1.5% (14 out of 918), whereas additions \nwere negligible (2 out of 918). \nThe Protein Interactome: \nThe PPI network as created by the STRING database revealed a handful of proteins that are part \nof the IsPETase network. Some of these proteins have been implicated in critical processes in the \nassociated pathway of plastic degradation.

Chlorogenate esterase (MHETase) interacts \nwith both s ubsites 1 and 2 for the subsequent degradation of MHET [ 7, 30]. In the absence of \nMHETase, PET is transformed into MHET, TPA, and EG but no further degradation of MHET \nhappens. TPA and EG serve as more readily useable carbon sources, but MHET necessitates \nadditional degradation to be transformed into TPA and EG. The other proteins involved in the \nnetwork are basic functional proteins like topoisomerase s or serine kinases with one membrane \nprotein also finding its place. \nSimilarities in Structures of Predicted PETases: \nGiven the recent discovery of PETase, not many structures were available and it was difficult to \ndetermine the structures from defined templates. To confirm the similarities in the sequence and \nthe domains, the hits were modelled against the template of th e complete structure of IsPETase. \nThe structure of RgPETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus. was available from the PDB with the \nid. 7DZT. The homology models for the rest of the 26 hits were obtained using the Maestro module \nof Schr\u00f6dinger and validated using ERRAT and Verify3D. Assessing the stereochemical \nproperties using PROCHECK, the Ramachandran Plot for the modelled structures (from \nPROCHECK) also verified (supplementary table 3)  the structural integrities (more than 94% in \nallowed regions for all entries except two where 90% were in allowed regions). \nThe structures were visualized in PyMOL and superimposed with the template structure (6ILW) \nto reveal striking similarities in their overall architecture, as shown in figure 1. The similarities in \nthe predicted structures were also checked using GraSR [29] to verify the visual output from \nPyMOL. GraSR  constructs a graph based on inter -residue distances derived from the tertiary \nstructure. The output is generated based on the predictions from a deep graph neural network. The \nobtained T\nM value represents the similarity of the structure on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the \nmost similar. For our predicted structures, the TM for all the models were above 0.9, with the closest \nbeing the structure from Acidovorax delafieldii.

While the best \ndocking score obtained, as mentioned earlier, was - 5.5 kcal/mol, some of the structures showed \neither low docking scores or had unacceptable values of RMSD. Of the 27 structures considered \n(including RgPETase), 15 structures showed binding affinity within -4.5 kcal/mol with acceptable \nRMSD values. Of these 15, 8 had docking scores very close to IsPETase, and 5 of these had \nidentical docking pockets. (figures 2 and 3, table 2).  \nHpPETase, HbPETase, and KsPETase belong to the type II class of PETases, exhibiting specific \nsubstitutions in the AXE domain and in subsite 1 and subsite 2, which influence the substrate \nbinding position. The binding pockets of type II  PETases exhibit modest variations and thereby, \nthe binding conformation of the ligand differs from that of IsPETase, which is a type IIb class of \nPETase.  \nThe serine, which was earlier mentioned as one of the conserved residues in the AXE domain, was \nexpectedly present almost all the complexes formed, as either the donor or acceptor in the \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Similarly, the presence of a tyrosine at position 87  \nof subsite 1 is deemed to favour an interaction between the aromatic group of the BHET and the \nPETase [30]. Among the predicted PETases, there is an equivalent distribution of tyrosine and \nphenylalanine at this position, which seems to be favourably interacting with the BHET as well. \nHpPETase, HbPETase and KsPETase showed the presence of a phenylalanine at th is position. \nTraditionally, the nitrogen atoms of Y87  and M161 have been known to be involved in the \nformation of the oxyanion hole, found in type II PETases. In the case of HpPETase, HbPETase \nand KsPETase, the nitrogen from the phenylalanine and the methionine contribute to the oxyanion \nhole which stabilizes the negatively charged oxyanion intermediate during PET hydrolysis . The \nW185 in the subsite 1, however, is a residue which has been conserved across all the five PETases. \nSimilarly, the isoleucine at 208, a part of subsite 1, has been found to be conserved in HpPETase \nand HbPETase, but has been replaced by a valine (hydrophobic) in RgPETase and KsPETase . \nGoing by the activity of RgPETase, the substitution has minimal effect on the  surface \nhydrophobicity. \nIn the subsite 2,  W159 and N241 are highly conserved across all the PETases and has been found \nto be crucial  for the enzymatic function , while A89 is replaced by a serine in RgPETase, \nHpPETase, HbPETase and KsPETase. Despite the substitution, there has been no reduction in the \nhydrolase activity of RgPETase when compared to IsPETase [14]. The threonine at position 88 is \nhowever a determinant in the classification of type II PETases into subcategories a and b. While \nT88 is highly conserved in type IIb PETases [6], substitutions of threonine to valine or leucine has \nbeen noted in type IIa PETases. The presence of a T88L mutation in RgPETase and T88V in \nKsPETase, HpPETase, and HbPETase , are indicative of their classification as type IIa  PETases \n[6]. Similarly, Ser 238 is substituted by phenylalanine in RgPETase and Ks PETase, but in \nHpPETase and HbPETase, it is substituted by a tyrosine, which further point to their type IIa \ncategorisation. All these substitutions have significantly improved the binding of substrate, with  \nHpPETase showing four times higher binding free energy, while KsPETase show ed two times \nhigher binding free energy when compared with the IsPETase. When compared with RgPETase \n(also a type IIa PETase ), all three candidates have substitutions in subsite II and show better \nbinding free energy. \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The docking poses chosen for \nthe MD were therefore based on the correctness of the orientation and not the mechanical choice \nof the topmost poses (table 2). \nThe binding free energy of protein- ligand complexes was calculated using MMPBSA to assess \ntheir stability and binding affinity. The cumulative binding free energies for the five prospective \nPETase-BHET (IsPETase -BHET, RgPETase -BHET, HpPETase -BHET, HbPETase -BHET, and \nKsPETase-BHET) complexes were - 2.75\u2009\u00b1\u20093.41, -0.59\u2009\u00b1\u20093.45, -12.16\u2009\u00b1\u20093.02, -1.98\u2009\u00b1\u20093.93, and -\n6.14\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14\u2009kcal/mol, respectively, as presented in table 3.

In order to mitigate the potential for poor connections and \ngeometry inside the structure, energy minimization was conducted prior to conducting the \nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  \nAmong all the PETase enzymes, HpPETase was found to be the most resilient on interaction with \nBHET (even better than IsPETase), with the RMSD values stabilizing around 0.4 nm throughout \nthe simulation, after an initial inflection (figure 5c) . In case of the IsPETase-BHET complex, the \naverage root mean square deviation (RMSD) values remained consistently below 0.5 nm for the \nwhole simulation. The HbPETase -BHET complex exhibited the third highest stability, with an \naverage RMSD value of 0.6 nm. The KsPETase performed better than the RgPETase  in it\u2019s \ninteractions with BHET \u2013 the RMSD stabilizing around 0.8 nm in due course, albeit with \nintermediate flexions. The RgPETase, which has now been experimentally proven to degrade PET,  \nstabilized at around a RMSD value of 1 nm. Overall, the dynamics for all the 5 PETases suggested \nthat the structures of the proteins remained intact during the simulation (figure 5).

The \nRMSF values consistently stayed below 0.3 for all the PETases, with occasional peaks above 0.3 \n(+0.1) (figure 6). In all the figures, the curve for RMSF of the specific PETase has been contrasted \nwith the curve for IsPETase (shown in the background in grey). For the reported PETases of I. \nsakaiensis and R. gummiphilus, the RMSF values were identical and lower  in comparison to the \nother PETases. Alignment of the sequences of the PETases with the RMSF data revealed that the \nfluctuations were greater in the regions of the proteins having flexible loops, as compared to the \nmore structured regions (supplementary table 5). The N terminal residues which show increased \nflexibility are predictably the ones with greater exposure to the solvent. The peaks of significant \nintensity visible in the RMSF plot of HbPETase, KsPETase, and HpPETase (figure 6b, 6c and 6d) \nare indicative of the presence of significantly more flexible regions of the protein segment at \nmultiple places in these enzymes . The substitution and addition events observed in the sequence \nalignment have an impact on the peak heights observed in RMSF. Though the loop regions display \nincreased variability in these PETases, this has however not impacted the ligand binding, as none \nof the residues from these regions contributed to the ligand binding cavity.

      "text": "The discovery of a PETase from I. sakaiensis with high degradability and specificity in the recent \npast provided a major boost to the search for plastic degrading enzymes from microbes. The \nsubsequent discovery of R. gummiphilus stirred the interest even more, and the past few years have \nseen renewed vigour in the quest for a naturally occurring solution to the ever-increasing threat of \nplastic pollution in the environment. The work in this manuscript would supplant and provide a \nheadstart to these efforts as it reveals a handful of prospective bacterial candidates which could be \ntapped to harness their plastic degradation abilities.  \nAll of the species shortlisted for this work have shown the presence of a conserved hydrolysis \ndomain, and some of them have been documented to hydrolyze PET and other polymers. \nSubstitution in the catalytic triad has been demonstrated to diminish enzyme activity, and sequence \nalignment confirms that the catalytic triad residues are 100% conserved across all enzymes.  \nBesides the typified Ser 160, Asp 206 and His 237 catalytic triad , the presence of a conserved \nMet161 in the vicinity has also been revealed as a major contributor to binding targets.  All the \nthree candidates have substitutions akin to the t ype IIa category of PETases, further bolstered by \nthe two conserved cysteine residues at positions 203 and 239 for the formation of an extra \ndisulphide bond (unlike type I PETases). \nThe spectrum of variation in the source of these bacterial candidates is also diverse and includes \nspecies residing in environments ranging from the marine to sub- zero habitats. Ketobacter \nalkanivorans [31], Marinobacter daqiaonensis [32], and Gammaproteobacteria bacterium [33] \nwere identified from marine sources and possess conserved hydrolase domains that may aid in the \nbreakdown of microplastics in the ocean, a major issue that plagues the environment and mankind. \nOn the other hand, Oleispira antarctica is another bacterium that could be instrumental in plastic \ndegradation at lower temperatures[34]. A.delafieldii is a common Gram negative aerobe which had \npreviously exhibited high degradation activity against Poly(tetramethylene succinate) -co-\n(tetramethylene adipate) (PBSA) [35] are commonly found in soil, water and on plants but are \nseldom implicated in human infections Interestingly, Schlegelella brevitalea  has been identified \nas a triple mutant of Ideonella sakaiensis , although its hydrolysis activity may not be as efficient \nas that of I. sakaiensis  [36].

The MD studies of the five PETases from \nvarious species revealed significant potential in HpPETase, HbPETase, and KsPETase for plastic \ndegradation, comparable to the experimentally validated IsPETase and RgPETase. The binding of \nBHET to HpPETase , infact, showed better binding energies than the reference IsPETase and \nRgPETase, signifying improved substrate affinity. The values of the MMPBSA calculations  in \nconjunction with its RMSD plot, illustrate enhanced structural stability over time for HpPETase -\nBHET binding, when contrasted with both IsPETase and RgPETase. The same could also be \nhypothesized for the HbPETase and the KsPETase too, arguably to a lesser extent though. The \nconformational stability of the PETases during the simulation using the PCA  analysis again \nrevealed stable structural conformations for the HpPETase, comparable to IsPETase. Interestingly, \nthe PETase from R. gummiphilus (one of the validated PETases) displayed a rather diffusive \ntrajectory during the dynamics, suggesting a flexible conformation during binding interactions, \nwhich may be attributed to the presence of variable region 1 (VR1, Q26- S51), the wobbling \ntryptophan-containing loop (WW-loop, W183-S187), variable region 2 (VR2, P207-V228) and the \nC-terminal region (G271-Y292) in the structure of this PETase. Furthermore, the outputs of Free \nEnergy Landscape (FEL) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) consistently demonstrated that these \npotential PETases preserve structural integrity and compactness during the simulation duration.  \nThe PETase from H. pe rtucinogena and to some extent, H. bauzanensis can be therefore, subjected \nto experimental analysis of their plastic degradation activity. Indeed, a structure for the PETase \nfrom H. bauzanensis have been now deposited, but the reports of its activity still remains elusive. \nThe prospective PETase from Ketobacter sp. however, does not show as much promise as the other \ntwo, but in some aspects, resembles the binding interactions of R. gummiphilus and hence, can also \nbe tried for PET degradation. Although the results obtained in the current study suggest the PET \ndegradation activities of these three alone, the rest of the PETases could also be a source of plastic \ndegradation enzymes, with suitable protein engineering processes to increase their activity. In that \ndirection, the characterization of the interface in these prospective enzymes, with a detailed \n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.
