Among other techniques, \nPET hydrolases (PETases) can be used to depolymerize this plastic. However, wildtype PETases exhibit poor \nspecific activities and insufficient thermostability, limiting their use in depolymerization processes which require \nhigh temperatures. In 2022, machine learning-aided enzyme engineering of a PETase stemming from the bac -\nterium Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) resulted in a more functional, active, stable, and tolerant variant (FAST- \nPETase). To rationalize the molecular basis of FAST-PETase \u2019 s improved thermal stability, we performed \ncomparative Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of wildtype \nIs PETase (WT-PETase) and FAST-PETase at 30\n\u25e6\nC and 50\n\u25e6\nC identifying thermolabile sequence stretches in the \nwildtype enzyme. Further analysis of the backbone flexibility revealed that all mutations of FAST-PETase \naffected these critical regions. Counterintuitively, the in-silico analyses additionally highlighted that the flexi -\nbility of these regions decreased at 50\n\u25e6\nC in FAST-PETase, instead of exhibiting increased flexibility at higher \ntemperature as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations. This effect was confirmed by physical \nenergy calculations, which suggest that temperature-dependent conformational changes of FAST-PETase \ndecrease the free energy of unfolding ( \u0394 G(stability)) and rigidify the enzyme at elevated temperatures \nenhancing stability. Looking forward, these findings might help guide the rational engineering of protein ther -\nmostability and contribute to our understanding of the thermal adaptation of thermophilic enzymes.\n1. Introduction\nTo achieve a circular economy, the ability to recycle the growing \namount of plastic waste is considered to be of high priority. [1] With PET \naccounting for around 12 % of the global solid waste volume (8 % by \nweight), the development of efficient and economical de- and repoly -\nmerization processes is therefore key. [2,3] One such PET depolymer -\nization strategy is the plastics \u2019 enzymatic hydrolysis, first reported in \n2005. [4,5] Although several enzymes with PET-hydrolyzing activities \nhave been identified, such as esterase, lipase and cutinase enzyme an -\nnotations, [6 \u2013 9] expensive PET pretreatments are necessary to achieve \nacceptable depolymerizing activities with these promiscuous enzymes. \n[10 \u2013 12] In 2016, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) was \nreported to be suitable for the operation at temperatures between 30 and \n50 \n\u25e6\nC. [13] However, this enzyme was found to be poorly stable, with \nloss of activities after 24 hours incubation at 37 \n\u25e6\nC. [14] Since PET \nbecomes more accessible near its glass transition temperature (65 \u2013 75 \n\u25e6\nC), [15] increasing T\nm \nand optimal operating temperature of Is PETase \nis desirable. Thus, several enzyme engineering strategies have been \napplied to optimize Is PETase \u2019 s utility by enhancing its thermostability, \nactivity and process conditions. [14,16 \u2013 19] As a result, two stabilized \nvariants, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, were generated, which dis -\nplayed higher thermostability ( \u0394 T\nm \n10 and 30 \n\u25e6\nC, respectively) and \nactivity at elevated temperatures ( > 60 \n\u25e6\nC) but lower activity when mild \ntemperatures (30 \u2013 50 \n\u25e6\nC) were applied in depolymerization experiments. \n[14,16,20] Building on initial engineering attempts, Is PETase was \n* Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: ac4086@coventry.ac.uk (S.

[20]\nRecent studies utilizing MD simulations and QM/MM calculations on \nFAST-PETase and PETase with and without a PET substrate model \nsuggest that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of FAST-PETase in PET \ndegradation is primarily due to two factors: control of substrate \nconformation and transition state stabilization. [21,22] Control of sub -\nstrate conformation is achieved by the enzyme \u2019 s ability to induce \nreactive conformations of the PET substrate, which are not found when \nthe substrate is free in solution. This pre-organization at the active site, \nparticularly at 50\n\u25e6\nC, optimizes substrate alignment in FAST-PETase \u2019 s \nactive site for catalysis. [21] Furthermore, transition state stabilization \nby FAST-PETase seems to be enhanced through an N233K mutation, \nwhich locally alters the depolymerases \u2019 structure increasing the basicity \nof Asp206 and strengthening the interaction with His237. This inter -\naction reduces the free energy barrier of the acylation stage \n(12.1 kcal/mol for FAST-PETase vs. 16.5 kcal/mol for wildtype Is PE -\nTase), ultimately accelerating the reaction rate. [22]\nIn addition to the improved transition state stabilization and the fine- \ntuned substrate binding conformation at 50 \n\u25e6\nC, FAST-PETase exhibits a \nnotably improved thermal stability, with a T\nm \nof 67 \n\u25e6\nC \u2013 an increase of \n18 \n\u25e6\nC compared to WT-PETase \u2019 s T\nm \nof 49 \n\u25e6\nC. Interestingly, unlike other \ndepolymerases, FAST-PETase performs best at 50\n\u25e6\nC, rather than at \ntemperatures near the glass transition of PET (65 \u2013 75 \n\u25e6\nC). At 50\n\u25e6\nC, FAST- \nPETase releases more than twice the amount of PET monomers (defined \nas the sum of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) \nterephthalate (MHET)) in 24 hours compared to ThermoPETase and \nDuraPETase. This improved performance at a specific temperature \nsuggests thermal adaptation of the biocatalyst, e.g., that the enzyme \u2019 s \ndynamic properties have been fine-tuned for efficient catalysis under \nspecific conditions. [23,24] In contrast, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase \nseem to rely on structural rigidity to maintain their function at higher \ntemperatures, prioritizing stability over dynamic flexibility.\nWhile hydrogen-bonding analysis of WT- and FAST-PETase crystal \nstructures indicate stabilizing effects of the introduced mutations \n(N233K/R224Q/S121E/D186H/R280A), [20] the influence of the mu -\ntations on protein dynamics is less well understood. Thus, we hypoth -\nesized that a more detailed analysis of the underlying protein dynamics \nwould provide insights into the molecular basis of FAST-PETase \u2019 s \nthermal adaptation whilst also enabling identification of novel hotspot \npositions for future enzyme engineering campaigns. In support of our \nhypothesis, Creveld et al. reported the ability to differentiate flexible \nregions which promote unfolding from those with catalytic importance \nby performing MD simulation of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi . Re -\ngions prone to unfolding were identified and proposed to serve as hot -\nspot areas for mutations. [25] Targeted mutagenesis of equivalent \nregions in the related Glomerella cingulate cutinase was later shown to \nimprove thermostability without influencing enzyme activity. [26] As \nthe discussed cutinases are part of \u03b1 / \u03b2 -hydrolase family (which com -\nprises all currently known PET-degrading enzymes), [27] following a \nsimilar approach to study unfolding regions in PETase seemed \npromising.\nHere, structural dynamics of WT- and FAST-PETase were studied by \nperforming both, CNAnalysis thermal unfolding simulations and MD \nsimulations at 30 and 50 \n\u25e6\nC. The simulations indicated a temperature- \ninduced stabilization of FAST-PETase, which was confirmed by \nsecondary-structure analysis and free energy calculations.\n2. Results\n2.1. Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis)\nConstraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) can be used to identify \nvariations with regards to rigidity and flexibility at optimal tempera -\ntures of homologous mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. [28] Based \non graph theory, global and local flexibility/rigidity characteristics of \nproteins can be derived from single or multiple protein structures to \nsupport data-driven protein engineering with the aim to improve the \nproteins \u2019 thermal stability. [29]\nAs a first step to analyze flexibility/rigidity characteristics of the \nselected PETase variants, thermal unfolding simulations of a single \nconstraint network derived from crystal structures of WT-PETase and \nFAST-PETase (PDB accessions 5XJH and 7SH6, respectively) were per -\nformed utilizing the CNAnalysis Web Interface ( http://www.cnanalysis. \nde ). [30] A constraint network refers to a model for which the protein \u2019 s \natomic or residue-level structure is represented as a network of nodes \n(atoms or residues) connected by edges, which correspond to stabilizing \ninteractions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic in -\nteractions, and covalent bonds. Through thermal unfolding simulations, \na stability map can be derived from the constraint network, which en -\nables the visualization of how rigid contacts are distributed and how \nthey are impacted by thermal stress, providing insights into the protein \u2019 s \nstructural stability.\nWhen analyzing the stability maps of the PETase variants ( Fig. 1 ), it \nbecame evident that while rigid contacts in sequence region 55 \u2013 60 of \nFAST-PETase were weakened compared to WT-PETase, all other \ndifferentiating regions exhibited stronger rigid contacts in FAST-PETase. \nFor instance, rigidity scores of contacts within region 110 \u2013 155 around \nposition 121 (-1.8 vs \u0000 2.2) and region 200 \u2013 230 around position 224 \n(-1.0 vs \u0000 1.5) increased for almost all contacts. Interestingly, the region \nsurrounding key mutation R280A in FAST-PETase, which alters the \nsubstrate binding site conformation to allow stronger substrate in -\nteractions, [18] also showed more rigid contacts (-0.8 vs \u0000 2.0) not seen \naround R180 in WT-PETase.\nTo further investigate the origin of thermal instability in WT- and \nFAST-PETase, unfolding nuclei frequencies were calculated using ther -\nmal unfolding simulations on an ensemble of networks (50 network \ntopologies). Unfolding nuclei are weak spots within the protein, which \ncan be considered as starting points of the thermal unfolding processes. \nResidues with higher unfolding nuclei frequencies represent weaker \nspots of the protein. Through the prediction of unfolding nuclei, at least \nfour potential hotspots for further stability engineering of WT- or FAST- \nPETase toward increased thermal adaptation were identified around \nresidues Y69, A82, V107 and M156 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Regions \naround substitutions S121E and D186H in FAST-PETase displayed a \nconsiderable drop in the unfolding nuclei frequencies compared to the \ncorresponding WT-PETase frequencies. Calculating the difference be -\ntween WT- and FAST-PETase frequencies mainly resulted in positive \nvalues indicating the overall reduction of unfolding nuclei.\n2.2. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations\nWhile CNAnalysis \u2019 s thermal unfolding simulations offered a \nstraightforward way to pinpoint protein regions influencing the rigidity \nand flexibility of WT- and FAST-PETase, molecular insights into residue \ninteractions and conformational changes cannot be identified by this \nmethodology. To confirm whether protein dynamics influences the \nPETase variants \u2019 thermal stability, we opted to carry out MD simulations \non both, the WT- and FAST-PETase, at 30\n\u25e6\nC and 50\n\u25e6\nC.\nAfter extensive three-step equilibration (constant volume and tem -\nperature (NVT) with restraints, constant pressure and temperature \n(NPT) with restraints, and free constant pressure and temperature \n(NPT)), five separate production runs were simulated for 100 nanosec -\nonds each.

Although \nthese distances may appear quite large for hydrogen bonds (typically \naround 0.35 nm), it is important to note that hydrogen bonds break and \nform dynamically over the simulation trajectory. The hydrogen bonding \ndetection algorithm also considers bonds that are only rarely formed.\nTo further support our hypothesis of a temperature-induced stabili -\nzation of FAST-PETase, we calculated the free energy of unfolding ( \u0394 G \n(Stability)) using a set of physical energy functions (EvoEF1 [31] , \nEvoEF2 [32] and FoldX [33] ) by applying them on the last state of all \nsimulation replicates ( Fig. 5 & Supplementary Fig. S6 ).

Discussion\nFAST-PETase, obtained through ML-assisted engineering, exhibits a \ntemperature-dependent dynamic behavior which is distinct from its \nparental enzyme. In this context, stability map analysis revealed that the \nstrength of rigid contacts is increased in FAST-PETase compared to the \nwildtype enzyme, while MD simulations identified instability regions \n(IS1-IS7) which display a different behavior as a function of the applied \ntemperature and the investigated variant. WT-PETase displayed signif -\nicantly higher RMSF values in instability regions at 50\n\u25e6\nC compared to \n30\n\u25e6\nC, indicative of increased flexibility at higher temperatures. Sur -\nprisingly, however, in FAST-PETase instability regions IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, \nIS5, and IS6 exhibited decreased flexibility at higher temperatures, \nsuggesting a temperature-induced stabilizing effect. Importantly, in this \ncontext, many mutations present in FAST-PETase are within or adjacent \nto the instability regions, suggesting a role in modulating the protein \u2019 s \nstability and dynamics through the reorganization of hydrogen bonding \npatterns potentially causing the thermal adaptation. For example, key \nmutations S121E and D186H impact the hydrogen bonds between res -\nidues E121 and W185, as well as H186 and S193, while the collapse of \nthese bonds at 50 \n\u25e6\nC is compensated, inter alia , by the formation of \nstabilizing bonds between E121 and H186, as well as H186 and S214.\nThe putative temperature-induced stabilization of FAST-PETase is \nfurther supported by a secondary structure analysis: While WT-PETase \ndisplayed a lower proportion of \u03b1 -helices and a higher proportion of \n3 \u2013 10 helices at 50 \n\u25e6\nC, FAST-PETase maintains its \u03b1 -helix content even at \nelevated temperature. Notably, 3 \u2013 10 helices are less abundant in nature \nand constitute only 10 \u2013 15 % of all helices in protein secondary struc -\ntures. This type of helix is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds \nbetween the carbonyl group of amino acid n and the amide group of the \namino acid n + 3. However, the formation of van der Waals contacts and \nhydrogen bonds is less favorable in a 3 \u2013 10 helix and in general, the \n\u03b1 -helix is considered to be more stable. Notably, 3 \u2013 10 helices are typi -\ncally observed as extensions of \u03b1 -helices suggesting that the 3 \u2013 10 helix \nmay serve as an intermediary conformation potentially playing a role in \nthe initiation of \u03b1 -helix folding. [34] Elevated temperatures are known \nto induce such conformational changes in proteins, altering their sec -\nondary structure elements. Thus, the observed structural differences \nTable 1 \nMD simulation-based hydrogen bonding analysis of FAST-PETase.\nHydrogen Bond Mean Distance [nm] \u0394 [nm]\n30\n\u25e6"

[35,36]\nThe structural characteristics of a thermophilic enzyme at higher \ntemperatures often resemble those of a mesophilic enzyme at lower \ntemperatures. [23,24] For instance, MD simulations of adenylate kinases \nhave shown similar local mobilities, folding free energy, and enzymatic \nactivities in kinases from mesophilic and hyperthermophilic origins at \ntheir optimal temperatures. In this context, it has been proposed that \nthis similarity arises from a shared protein energy landscape within their \noptimal temperature environments.

In contrast to other engineered PETa -\nses, FAST-PETase does not exhibit this trade-off, as its stabilization is \nonly induced at elevated temperatures, allowing it to maintain both \nstability and activity across a broader temperature range. Notably, \nHOT-PETase, developed through directed evolution, has been reported \nto exhibit activity across an even wider temperature range than \nFAST-PETase and demonstrates best-in-class thermal stability, with a T\nm \nof 82.5 \n\u25e6\nC. Similar to FAST-PETase, mutations in HOT-PETase appear to \nenhance structural stability while maintaining the flexibility of the \nactive site, a combination rarely seen in rigorously thermostabilized \nvariants. [41]\nLooking forward, the design of thermostable and active Is PETase \nvariants could be further guided by identifying naturally evolved ther -\nmophilic proteins and adapting their binding sites to fit the desired \nsubstrate through directed evolution.

Conclusion\nOur comparative MD-driven study of WT- and FAST-PETase sheds \nlight on the thermal adaptation of proteins, specifically highlighting the \nrole of flexibility regions and temperature-dependent conformational \nchanges that impact both stability and functionality. We anticipate that \nanalyzing conformational enzyme ensembles with energy function will \nfurther improve the accuracy of thermal stability predictions offering \npotential for in-silico pre-screening of enzyme variants. Overall, this \nwork not only supports the rational design of thermostable enzymes but \nalso contributes to a broader understanding of thermal adaptation in \nthermophilic enzymes.\n5. Methods\n5.1.

MD simulations\nFor both variants (WT- and FAST-PETase), side chain pKa values \nwere calculated using PROPKA and PDB2PQR server (version 2.0.0). \n[47,48] According to the results provided for a pH 8 and the parse \nforcefield, the residues \u2019 protonation states were adapted using OpenMM \nModeller class.
