In this study, we use\nthe term \u2033PET hydrolase\u2033 to denote enzymes with\ndemonstrated PET hydrolytic activity, acknowledging that\nthe observed activity of these enzymes is very likely\npromiscuous activity. At the time of writing, there are 127\nPET hydrolases recorded in the PAZy database and on the\norder of 250 total known enzymes to have PET depolymeriza-\ntion activity.\n12\nSignificant efforts have been dedicated to understand and\nengineer these natural enzyme scaffolds to improve their\nperformance under industrially relevant conditions, especially\nto operate at thermophilic temperatures (\u223c65\u221270 \u00b0C).\n1,13,14\nMechanistic studies of structure and dynamics have revealed\nkey factors influencing enzyme performance, including active\nsite binding, flexibility, and the role of individual amino acids\nin catalysis.\n15\u221218\nSequence databases and metagenomes have\nbeen mined and clustered for homologs, and ancestral\nsequences \u201crevived\u201d to discover new PET hydrolase scaf-\nfolds.\n9\u221211,19,20\nFor example, concurrently to this work, Seo et\nal. developed a natural sequence cluster framework that groups\nPET hydrolases by sequence similarity and systematically tests\nrepresentatives from high-performing clusters.\n11\nAdditionally,\nReceived: May 20, 2025\nRevised: August 19, 2025\nAccepted: August 20, 2025\nPublished: September 3, 2025\nResearch Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis\n\u00a9 2025 The Authors.

In contrast\nto an HMM search alone, or the clustering approach of Seo et\nal., our work uses iterative, supervised machine learning\npredictors trained on experimental data from the peer-reviewed\nliterature and from our assay to filter candidate sequences, with\na focus on challenging conditions including acid tolerance and\nthermal tolerance. We used high-throughput experimental\ntechniques and an automated liquid handling robot to express\nand purify over 200 enzymes and screen for activity across a\nrange of conditions, including temperature, pH, and substrate\ncrystallinity.\n28\nFrom this screening, we identified 91 novel (115\ntotal) PET hydrolases with diverse activity profiles, including\nsome with pH optima <7, and with activity at or greater than\nLCC-ICCG\n21\nat pH 4.5 on crystalline powder. Of the\ncandidates tested, we achieved a hit rate of 55% active PET\nhydrolase and 22% with activity at pH 4.5. We used these data\nto identify regions of the sequence and surface with potential\nimportance for low pH activity. We further demonstrate that\nmodels trained on all three rounds of data have higher\npredictive accuracy than those that use only literature data or\nour first two rounds, suggesting that future rounds of enzyme\ndiscovery may attain even higher hit rates. We expect that\nthese findings may serve as a foundation for future PET\nhydrolase engineering efforts and enhance sequence mining\nstrategies for enzymes with activities tailored to specific\nconditions.\n\u25a0"

A\nprofile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was constructed from a\nmultiple sequence alignment of 61 experimentally verified PET\nhydrolases identified from PAZy (extracted Sept. 21, 2021).\nMultiple sequence alignment was performed using\nMAFFT.\n12,29\nThe resulting profile HMM was used to search\nagainst three sequence databases: NCBI nonredundant protein\ndatabase, JGI combined hotsprings metagenome database, and\nMGnify.\n30,31\nHMM searches were performed using HMMER\n(v3.2.1) with a bit score threshold of 100 for both the full\nsequence score (-T 100) and domain score (\u2212domT 100).\nThe same thresholds were applied to the inclusion thresholds\n(\u2212incT 100 and \u2212 incdomT 100). This initial search retrieved\n10,633 putative PET hydrolase sequences.\n32\nFor round two\nand three, we used a pool of candidates from more sensitive\nsearch using an HMM of 75 PAZy sequences (Mar. 7, 2023)\nand a search bit threshold modified to 160, yielding 8067 hits.\nHMMs are provided on Zenodo.\nCandidate PET hydrolases were prioritized using a\ncombination of machine learning-based activity and property\npredictors. In Round 1, a variational autoencoder (VAE) was\ntrained on aligned candidate sequences to learn a continuous\nlatent representation, followed by a supervised rank-based\npredictor of PET hydrolase activity. In Rounds 2, PET\nhydrolase activity was instead predicted using an ensemble\npredictor, which showed better performance than the Round 1\nmodel. See Zenodo for details. In Round 2 and 3, predicted\nthermostability, PET hydrolase activity, and pH optimum were\nused for multiobjective selection. All property predictors were\nbenchmarked using cross-validation. Candidate filtering\nincluded sequence identity thresholds and clustering to ensure\nnovelty and diversity. Full methods for the models used in\nselection in Round 1\u22123 are given in Supporting Information\nSection S1.\nProtein Expression and Purification. Selected genes\nwere codon optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized by\nTwist Biosciences, and cloned into a pCDB179 expression\nvector (Addgene #91960, gifted by Christopher Bahl)\ncontaining an N-terminal 10xHis-SUMO fusion. Proteins\nwere expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) using autoinduction\nmedia in 24-deep well plates. Expression, cell lysis, and nickel\naffinity purification were carried out using an OT-2 robotic\nplatform as described previously.\n28\nSUMO tags were cleaved\nusing an in-house His-tagged SUMO protease. Protein\nconcentration was measured using a BCA assay and\nnormalized to 0.1 mg/mL for downstream applications. Full\nexpression and purification protocols are available in\nSupporting Information Section S2.\nThermostability Measurement. Differential scanning\nfluorimetry was performed on a Bio Rad CFX96 Touch\nReal-Time PCR machine. 45 \u03bcL of enzyme solution (from 0 to\n0.3 mg/mL after concentration normalization) was combined\nwith 5 \u03bcL of 5X Sypro Orange Dye (ThermoFisher Scientific\nS6650) in a PCR plate (Bio-Rad HSP9601), which was then\nsealed (ThermoFisher Scientific 4311971) and the following\nprogram was used: 1. 25 \u00b0C: 0:15; 2. 25 \u00b0C: 0:31; 3. 25 \u00b0C:\n0:15 (+0.3 \u00b0C/cycle, ramp 0.3 \u00b0C/s); 4.

PET substrates, either amorphous film\n(Goodfellow ES30-FM-000145) or crystalline powder (Good-\nfellow ES30-PD-006031) were loaded into 96 deep-well plates\n(NEST 503501) with 3.5 mg in each well. Amorphous film was\ncut into 0.34 \u00d7 0.34 cm and loaded manually. Powder was\ndispensed using the Powdernium Automated Powder Dosing\nSystem (Symyx). 450 \u03bcL of buffer solution (prepared at room\ntemperature) was added. The buffers used were 50 mM\nNaCitrate for pH 4.5 and 5.5 and 50 mM NaPhosphate for pH\n6.5 and 7.5. The enzymes were reordered in a fresh plate and\nnormalized to 0.1 mg/mL if necessary. 50 \u03bcL of enzyme\nsolution (5 \u03bcg) was added to each well with blanks for each pH\ncontaining just the buffer of the enzyme solutions. Aluminum\nheat sealing foil (Azenta 4ti-0535) as well as autoclave tape\naround the foil edges was used to prevent evaporation. Plates\nwere incubated at temperature (40 or 60 \u00b0C) for 48 h after\nwhich they were cooled at room temperature for 30 min then\nstored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The amount of aromatic product released\nwas evaluated by using absorbance at 260 and 280 nm on 100\n\u03bcL aliquots of the reaction supernatant. Reactions containing\ncrystalline powder were filtered through MultiScreen\nHTS\nGV\nFilter Plates (Millipore MSGVN2210) prior to analysis. The\ncalculation of product was performed as previously de-\nscribed.\n28\nCrystallography. The purified protein was concentrated to\n22 mg/mL and screened through approximately 600\ncrystallization conditions.

Crystals were grown\nby sitting drops vapor diffusion at 16 \u00b0C using a 1:1 ratio of\nprotein to well solution and grew in approximately 2 weeks.\nCrystals were transferred to a well solution supplemented with\n20% glycerol and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction\ndata was collected at the SSRL BL12\u22122 beamline using Dectris\nPILATUS EIGER 2XE 16 M PAD detector. The crystals\nbelonged to space group P3\n2\n21 with dimensions a = 87.25 \u00c5,\n87.25 \u00c5, 148.87 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, \u03b2 = 90\u00b0, \u03b3 = 90\u00b0. There are two\nmonomers in the asymmetric unit. All data were processed\nwith XDS.\n33\nThe structure was solved by molecular\nreplacement using Phaser\n34\nand by using a homology model\ndeveloped from a PETase (PDB code: 8ETY) as the search\nmodels. Multiple rounds of manual model building using\nCoot\n35\nand model building using the Buccaneer\n36\nprogram\nwere needed to successfully complete the model. The\nstructures were refined by using Refmac\n37\nand manually fitted\nusing the Coot program.\nSequence and Structure Analysis. The set of enzymes\nthat exhibited nonzero activity in our assay at any condition\nwere aligned with MUSCLE 5.1 with default parameters.\n38\nThis alignment is provided on Zenodo. The same procedure\nwas used to align active training enzymes for HMMs. To\nidentify determinants of condition-specific activity, we\nperformed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses on\nenzymes with measurable activity. Conservation of physico-\nchemical residue categories was assessed across performance\ngroups using Jalview,\n39\nhighlighting alignment columns\nuniquely conserved under specific conditions (e.g., low pH).\nStructural models were generated via ColabFold\n40\n(mean\npLDDT > 90) and aligned using mTM-align. Surface\nproperties\ufffdincluding electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and\nstickiness\ufffdwere computed with SURFMAP\n41\nand compared\nbetween groups at each mapped surface location. Additionally,\npredicted pK\na\nvalues of titratable residues were analyzed using\nPROPKA\n42\nSignificance for surface properties an pK\na\nwas\nassessed via Mann\u2212Whitney U tests with p < 0.05. Sequence\npositions prioritized by pretrained model attention (temBER-\nTure, EpHod) were also mapped to the alignment, though not\nused in the analysis of significant factors presented here. A\nmapping of all factors computed as mean differences between\ngroups and the values for individual candidates can be found in\nAppendix B and C\n43,44\nFinally, we clustered additional\nnoncatalytic domains by pairwise similarity, identifying a\ngroup of low-pH-active enzymes harboring a ricin B lectin-like\nmodule.

We tested HMMs with further training data by adding\nenzymes with nonzero activity at a particular experimental\ncondition to an initial set of PET hydrolases and computing\nthe score for the same experimental condition. We compared\nthree starting points: HMM-17, HMM-61, and D1-Scraped-\n513. Scores were normalized to each HMM\u2019s score for LCC-\nICCG, to allow HMM scores across data splits to be\ncombined.

We conducted a PET hydrolase homolog screen\nconsisting of three rounds (candidate ID per round: DP for\nRound 1, TEP for Round 2, and ESM for Round 3, vide infra),\neach augmented by machine learning on literature data or on\nprevious round data (Figure 1A). A summary of the PET\nhydrolase data we used for this search is summarized in Table\n1. Details for all models and parameters used for searching and\nfiltering candidates can be found in the Methods Section, while\nan overview is given for each round below.\nFor Round 1 (Enzymes DP001-DP098, 94 total), we first\nconstructed a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM-61) using\n61 experimentally verified PET hydrolases from the PAZy\ndatabase.\n12\nDatabase searches using this HMM against MGnify\nand NCBI nonredundant (nr) database identified 10,633\ncandidate sequences, which were filtered to 8081 non-\nredundant sequences.\n30,31\nWe then developed a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) using the selected sequences and trained a\nsupervised linear top model trained on the VAE latent space\nusing 513 sequences with experimental PET-hydrolase activity\nfrom the literature (D1-Scraped-513). A summary of the works\nthat were scraped to produce this data set is given in Table S1.\nWith this approach, we selected 96 novel candidate sequences,\nidentified as the top predictions of the linear model, with less\nthan 90% identity to known PET hydrolases. We moved\nforward with these sequences for expression and experimental\ntesting as described in the next section.\nIn Round 2 (Enzymes TEP001-TEP197, 191 total), we used\na larger HMM with new additions from PAZy (75 total) and\naccepted more remote homologs in the search. We filtered\nthese homologs with three machine learning models trained to\npredict PET hydrolysis activity, thermal stability, and acid\ntolerance, respectively. For PET activity, we developed a new\nmodel, an ensemble of supervised logistic regression and\nunsupervised scores that outperformed the evolutionary VAE\nfrom Round 1 in 5-fold cross-validation on the D-513 scraped\ndata set. Homologs were also scored by a thermal stability\npredictor developed in house, trained on embedding outputs\nfrom the protein language model ProtT5 and melting\ntemperatures from the Meltome Atlas, as well as for acid\ntolerance by EpHod (Figure S1).\n43,48\nTo ensure broad\nexploration, candidates for Round 2 were selected as those\nthat maximized any individual score, or are above the 50th\npercentile for all three, and have less than 90% identity to\nknown PET hydrolases and to each other.\nIn Round 3 (Enzymes ESM001-ESM191, 190 total), we\nincorporated activity data from Round 1 and 2 to create\nsupervised models specifically trained to predict activity and\nmelting temperature from our assay. Several embedding\nmethods were tested, finding that ESM1v mean pool\nembeddings performed best in cross validation (Spearman\ncorrelation of 0.537 against max observed activity) with a ridge\nregressor. Candidates were selected based on the absolute\nvalue of predicted activity of 10 mM product/mg enzyme, > 55\n\u00b0C predicted melting temperature, and sequence identity of\n<95% to each other and previously reported PET hydrolases.\nHigh-Throughput Experimentation Characterizes a\nDiverse Set of Active PET Hydrolases.

Of these, 221 (47%) successfully purified and\nachieved yields greater than or equal to a 0.1 mg/mL threshold\n(Figure 1C). Those that yielded below threshold (254 total,\n53%) may have failed due to poor expression, poor solubility,\nor incomplete cleavage of the target protein from the magnetic\nbeads. The highest yield reached was approximately 600 \u03bcg\nfrom a single well. The average yield of successfully purified\nenzymes was 167 \u03bcg or an 84 mg/L titer.\nThe thermostability of the purified enzymes was determined\nusing differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using Sypro\nOrange as an unfolding indicator. Due to the high sensitivity of\nDSF, which requires minimal protein and can measure melting\ntemperatures even below the concentration detection thresh-\nold, all expressed enzymes were evaluated for thermostability\nregardless of recorded yields. In total, 233 enzymes\ndemonstrated measurable melting temperatures (T\nm\n), with\nobservable T\nm\nvalues for some samples with concentrations\nbelow 0.1 mg/mL (Figure 1D). The range of T\nm\nvalues\nobserved was 25.3\u221282.3 \u00b0C and the average T\nm\nfor all samples\nwith measured values was 56.3 \u00b0C. A comparison of the\nexpression yield as a function of T\nm\ndid not reveal a strong\ncorrelation (Figure S3).\nSuccessfully purified enzymes were carried forward to\ndetermine their depolymerization activity on PET. Of the\n221 successfully purified enzymes, 212 were tested for activity\nwith several being excluded due to insufficient volume to meet\nthe minimum number of test conditions. We loaded 96-deep\nwell plates with amorphous PET film (aFilm) or crystalline\nPET powder (cryPow), both sourced commercially from\nGoodfellow with reported crystallinities of 4.0 \u00b1 2.0%, and\n39.3 \u00b1 2.0%, respectively.\n9,49,50\nBuffer was added for the pH\nlevels tested as follows: 4.5 (NaCitrate), 5.5 (NaCitrate), 6.5\n(NaPhosphate), 7.5 (NaPhosphate), and 8.5 (glycine). The\nPET solids loading was 3.5 mg in a 0.5 mL reaction (0.7 wt/v\n%). The enzyme was added (5 \u03bcg) to reach a final enzyme\nloading of 1.43 mg/g PET. The plates were mixed briefly via\nshaking, heat sealed with foil, and incubated at either 40 or 60\n\u00b0C without shaking for 48 h.\n51\nEnzymes were grouped by yield to determine the number of\nconditions possible to test. Those with high enough yields\nwere tested in 32 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 2 PET\nsubstrates, in duplicate) (Figure 2A). Enzymes yielding less\nwere tested in 8 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 1 PET\nsubstrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2B) and those with the lowest\nyields were tested in 4 conditions (4 pHs, 1 temperature (40\n\u00b0C), 1 PET substrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2C). In Round 1, the\npH levels tested were 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. In later rounds,\nlower pHs were targeted and the values tested were 4.5, 5.5,\n6.5, and 7.5. The assays were analyzed using ultraviolet\u2212visible\n(UV\u2212Vis) spectroscopy of the aromatic products released:\nTPA, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and\nbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET).\n28,52\nOverall, 115 active enzymes were identified, or 54% of the\n212 tested. Activity was defined as an aromatic absorbance\nreading at 260 nm of 0.05 above the blank in at least 1\ncondition. The number of active enzymes in different\ncondition categories is given in Table 2. Figure 2A\u2212C displays\nthe 58 most active enzymes with activity in at least 1 condition\nabove 25 \u03bcmol product/mg enzyme. The activity profiles for\nall active enzymes are shown in Figures S4\u2212S6, as well as a\ncomparison to a benchmark enzyme, LCC-ICCG, which was\nincluded as a positive control in all assay plates.\n21\nCompared to\nLCC-ICCG, an engineered PET hydrolase with very high\nactivity on amorphous film at high temperatures but limited\nactivity at low pH conditions,\n21\nthe active enzymes identified\nin this study display moderate to low activity near LCC-\nICCG\u2019s optimal conditions. However, several showed superior\nperformance at the challenging pH 4.5 condition, which we\ntargeted for increased industrial relevance. Despite their\ncomparable or superior performance to the benchmark at\nlow pH, we anticipate that further engineering will be required\nto achieve activity levels sufficient for meaningful bioreactor\nstudies. For PET hydrolases identified here that were tested on\nboth substrates, they appear in most cases to be more active on\ncrystalline PET powder than amorphous PET film. This\nobservation may be due to the increased surface area, different\nsurface properties, and availability of initial and easily cleavable\nnoncrystalline regions in the powder versus the film.\nOur iterative machine learning approach led to notable\nperformance improvements across successive rounds, as\nreflected in increased hit rates for activity in any condition\ntested (44% in Round 1 to 67% in round 3), increased hit rates\nfor activity specifically at low pH (crystalline powder pH = 5.5,\n40 \u00b0C, 19% in round 1 to 59% in Round 3), and higher average\nthermal stability (52.8 \u00b0C in Round 1 to 59.0 \u00b0C in Round 3),\nas shown in Figure 2D. Full counts of number of enzymes\ntested and hit rates for all condition sets over each round are\ngiven in Table S2. We note that the interpretation of the hit\nrate for activity in any condition is complicated by the fact that\nnot all enzymes were tested in all conditions. For low pH, the\npronounced improvement in hit rate for Round 3 was likely\ndue to the addition of supervised predictors trained on low-\nnoise assay data from previous rounds, unlike earlier rounds\nwhich relied on globally trained predictors of PET hydrolase\nactivity data from disparate experiments in literature (D1\u2212513-\nscraped). The hit rate increase was more pronounced for\ncrystalline powder activity, for which we tested the most\nhomologues. In Rounds 2 and 3, the hit rate and average T\nm\nincrease is likely due to the addition of dedicated predictors for\nacid tolerance and thermal stability, including EpHod and T\nm\npredictions.\n43\nMany enzymes exhibited higher activity at the\nlower temperature tested (40 \u00b0C), likely due to their lower\nFigure 2. continued\nwere tested under every condition. Orange bars represent the hit rate for active enzymes on crystalline powder at pH 5.5 and 40 \u00b0C, a targeted\ncondition where all enzymes were tested.\nTable 2.

For\nenzymes with higher thermostability, such as ESM050 (T\nm\n=\n82.3 \u00b0C), higher activities were observed at the higher\ntemperature (60 \u00b0C). Generally, temperature enhances\ncatalytic rate as long as the enzyme remains stable and active\nat those temperatures. As the median value of T\nm\nin the\nenzymes studied was \u223c 57 \u00b0C, it is unsurprising that most\nshowed reduced activity at 60 \u00b0C.\nFrom the PET hydrolases that were successfully purified and\nassayed for PET hydrolytic activity, we analyzed the sequence\ndiversity (Figure 3). A phylogenetic tree based on sequence\nsimilarity of all sequences that showed activity along with\npreviously reported PET hydrolases is given in Appendix A,\nwhere many of the sequences tested fall in the phylum\nActinomycetes. A subset of that tree is shown in Figure 3A,\nincluding a few commonly studied PET hydrolases and the\ncandidates that we found with >20 \u03bcmol product/mg of\nenzyme conversion at pH 5.5, crystalline powder, 40 \u00b0C. We\nadditionally computed a 2D uniform manifold approximation\n(UMAP) based on pairwise negative BLOSUM62 scores\nbetween active PET hydrolases in this study and those from\nprevious studies in Figure 3B.\n9\u221211\nFigure S7 depicts the space\nof this mapping for each previous study separately. We observe\nthat the PET hydrolases from this work are generally within\nthe manifold of known enzymes, although we saturate some\nareas that previously had few examples. Of the 115 PET\nhydrolases found to be active in this study, 23 were recently\ndescribed by Seo et al.,\n11\nand many but not all of our low pH\nactive candidates fall within the cluster they identified as most\nperformant. In general, candidates with nonzero activity at low\npH appears to congregate. All sequences shared a catalytic\ndomain with the Asp-His-Ser triad within the conserved \u03b1/\u03b2\nhydrolase fold, as shown by the alignment of C\u03b1 atoms for\neach Alphafold2 predicted structure against LCC-ICCG using\nmTm-align (Table S3).\n53\nA subset of enzymes were noted to contain additional\ncarbohydrate binding domains (CBMs), which we labeled with\ndbCAN2.\n54\nInterestingly, those with CBM13 were more likely\nto be active at pH 4.5, with 50% of CBM13 enzymes active in\nthis condition compared to 17% of all tested enzymes active in\nthis condition. These CBM13-containing enzymes are likely\ncomponents of enzyme cocktails for the interaction with or\nbreakdown of natural polyesters, such as cutin and suberin\nfound in proximity to carbohydrates, for example in the plant\ncell wall.\n55\nThese are marked with squares in Figure 3A,B\nwhere they occupy a single branch on the tree (outlined) and\ncluster in 2D sequence space, based solely on the tree\ncalculation using only the catalytic domain. A subcluster of the\nCBM13 domain, labeled CBM13(Sub) and annotated as ricin\nB lectin, had an even higher hit rate at pH 4.5 with 11 out of\n13 enzymes active (85%) as shown in Figure S8. The\nmechanism of this trend is unclear, but it may be influenced\nby evolutionary pressures on the CBM being coupled to other\nproperties that contribute to pH tolerance. While acknowl-\nedging that the enzymes explored here are not the entirety of\nknown sequence space, in conjunction with PET hydrolase\nsearches in the literature to date, our findings suggest that\nmoderate PET hydrolysis activity is prevalent across enzyme\nclasses and considerable sequence distances. This is consistent\nwith the hypothesis of diverse promiscuity for this substrate.\nTo provide a basis for structural investigations, we selected\nthe most performant enzymes from our Round 1 candidates\nthat also expressed well in the small-scale experiments.\nExpression of these enzymes was scaled-up, and one enzyme,\nDP043 from Actinoplanes sp. DH11, was successfully crystal-\nlized, with the crystal structure being determined using\nmolecular replacement (Table S4 and Figure S9A). The\ncrystal structure aligns closely with other known PET\nhydrolases with an all-atom RMSD of 0.827 \u00c5 from LCC-\nICCG (PDB: 6THT) and 0.512 \u00c5 from the Alphafold\nstructure of its closest identified homologue in the HMM\nsearch, enzyme 407 from Erickson et al. (Figure S9B).\n9\nWhile\nmultiple AlphaFold models have been shown to closely\ncorrelate with independent crystallographic models of these\ncompact \u03b1/\u03b2 folds,\n9\nwe wanted to validate this here. Alignment\nof the DP043 AlphaFold3 and crystallographic models shows\nclose alignment, including side chains, with an all-atom RMSD\nof only 0.266 \u00c5 and accurate prediction via Alphafold3 of the\nlocation of the Ca\n2+\nion observed in the crystal structure\n(Figure S9C). The crystal structure revealed a Ca\n2+\nion, a\nfeature known in other PET hydrolases which has been\ntargeted for rational engineering due to its role in stabilizing\nFigure 3.

Using the activity data collected at multiple\npH conditions, we explored differences between enzymes\nactive at low pH and those active only at higher pH levels. We\nsplit the enzymes into those two groups with 35 active at low\npH (pH 4.5) and 57 active only at higher pHs to evaluate\ndifferences in sequence conservation, predicted pK\na\n, and\nsurface properties. For each residue in the alignment of all\nsequences, we determined any statistically significant (p <\n0.05) differences for these properties (conservation, pK\na\n,\nelectrostatics, hydrophobicity, circular variance), with further\ndetails provided in the Methods. Table S5 contains all\nsignificant factors identified mapped back to LCC-ICCG and\nthe alignment of all active sequences. Appendix B shows per-\nresidue distributions of each property where a significant\ndifference between performance groups was found.\nFor each candidate, we counted how many of these\nsignificant factors were observed and compared that number\nto its activity at pH 4.5 in Figure 4A, where we see a Spearman\ncorrelation of 0.53 (p < 0.05). Looking specifically at amino\nacid conservation, we found 9 sequence positions that were\nmore conserved for enzymes with low pH activity than for\nthose with only neutral activity (Figure 4B). The distribution\nof amino acids at these positions is given in Appendix B.\nSignificant differences were also observed for hydrophobicity,\nmeasured using the Kyte-Doolittle method.\n56\nMost of the\nsurface tended to be more hydrophobic for low pH active\ncandidates than neutral activity, seen in Figure 4C, where we\nshow the average shift. This trend is exacerbated near the\nsubstrate binding site such as A62, V177 and I208 on LCC-\nICCG which each had a shift of 1.0 units or more for low pH\nactive enzymes. The observed properties for two enzymes with\npH optima <6, ESM065 (which showed equivalent activity to\nLCC-ICCG at pH 4.5) and ESM091 are given in Figure 4D,E.\nBoth exhibited more factors that were associated with low pH\nactivity than the average for inactive candidates, have >6 out of\n9 of the conserved residues identified, and have a hydrophobic\nregion near the binding site. Mappings of all properties where\ndifferences are found and the observed properties for all\ncandidates are shown in Appendix C. It is important to note\nthat these trends are not absolute; for instance, although low\nFigure 4. Significant sequence and surface properties associated with low pH activity.

AlphaFold3 was used to produce the structures.\n57\n(A) The relationship between the number of factors\nheld by an enzyme as a function of its experimental activity for crystalline powder, pH = 4.5, T = 40 \u00b0C, where enzymes with more observed factors\ntend to have higher activity.

Of all\nfactors found to be significant when comparing these groups, those exhibited by ESM065 (if the ESM065 value is closer to the acid tolerant mean)\nare marked. Larger and brighter regions of the protein backbone indicate more factors (max 6). Middle: Residues that tended to be conserved for\nacid tolerance that we observed in ESM095 (6 out of 9). Right: hydrophobicity for ESM095, only colored for positions that where significant\ndifferences were found.

Further testing with, for example,\nadsorption assays may help elucidate mechanistic interpreta-\ntions for these identified correlations.\nWe additionally identified 13 positions in the catalytic\ndomain with significantly different predicted pK\na\ns between\nenzymes active at low pH (4.5 and 5.5) compared to those\nwith activity only at higher pH (6.5, 7.5, 8.5), five of which\noccur in or in close proximity to the catalytic triad, as shown in\nFigure 5. For the low pH active enzymes, on average the\ncatalytic histidine exhibited a negative shift of \u22120.37 pK\na\n,\nsuggesting more deprotonation at low pH for acid tolerant\ncandidates, potentially facilitating an easier proton transfer\nfrom serine as it attacks the substrate nucleophile. The trend\nfor the catalytic aspartate was an increase in average pK\na\nby\n0.26, which differs from findings for serine proteases with a\nsimilar mechanism where it is suggested that the deprotonated\naspartate helps position the histidine.\n42,58\nIt is possible that this\nis impacted by or offset by a number of other observations.\nFirst, the downstream residue from serine is a histidine in 94%\nof active enzymes (position 300 in the multiple sequence\nalignment), and when histidine it exhibits a large positive\npredicted pK\na\nshift of 1.5 for acid tolerant candidates. This\nhistidine may be serving a similar purpose to the catalytic\naspartate from the opposite side and protonation state. We also\nnote three other residues within 15 \u00c5 (using the TEP109\npredicted structure) of the catalytic histidine that are\nfrequently charged in the PET hydrolases studied here.\nGiven that electrostatic potential scales inversely with distance,\nthese positions likely contribute to the pK\na\nof active site\nresidues. The residue directly downstream of the catalytic\nhistidine (aligned position 383) is aspartate in 80% of acid\ntolerant candidates compared to 13% in neutral active\ncandidates. All enzymes with pH optima <6 have this aspartate.\nThere is also a position about 9 \u00c5 from the active site (aligned\nposition 224), and in close proximity to H300, that is leucine\nand uncharged in 94% of examples. The only exceptions are\nTEP109 (the top performer at pH 4.5), two other enzymes\nwith activity comparable to LCC-ICCG at pH 4.5, and another\ntwo that were acid tolerant that have a charged glutamic acid in\nthis position. It is possible that this glutamic acid (Glu224) is\ncontributing to the positive shift of His300 and cascading to\nthe negative shift of the catalytic proton transferring\nhistidine.\n59\nFinally, alignment position 378, about 14 \u00c5 away\nis nearly always glutamic acid for active candidates, except in a\nfew examples, 4 out of 5 being acid tolerant, and including\nTEP109 where it is an uncharged glutamine. A depiction of the\nactive site of TEP109, which exhibits all these features and\ndemonstrated the highest activity at pH 4.5 is given in Figure\n5. Further testing, such as with a mutational scan, may establish\ncausation to the pK\na\ncorrelations identified in this data set.\nPET Homolog Activity Predictors Applied to Sub-\nstrate, pH, and Temperature. We next used our data to\nprobe the ability of HMMs and supervised activity predictors\nlike those used in experimental Rounds 1\u22123 as a function of\ncondition and data set size. First, we tested three different\nHMMs (the \u201cstarting\u201d HMMs) for their ability to distinguish\nactive from nonactive candidates measured by area under the\nreceiver operator curve (AUROC): HMM-17, which was used\nin the search in Erickson et al., HMM-61, which was used for\nthe Round 1 search in this work, and an alignment of D1\u2212513-\nScraped, the largest set of known active PETases at the time.\nResults for select conditions are shown for in Table 3 below.\nWe observed that performance varied across conditions and\nwas sensitive to the PET hydrolases included in the search\nHMM, with values ranging from worse than random (<0.5) to\n>0.85 (Table S6). We found that HMM-17, which included\nmostly thermally stable PET hydrolases tested on amorphous\nand analog substrates tended to outperform the HMMs with\nlarger sets of active PET hydrolases from the literature,\nparticularly for high temperature activity on amorphous film.\nPerformance of all HMMs is no better than random for\ncrystalline powder and acidic conditions.\nWe further looked to investigate the utility of our data\ncollected across different conditions (in this study, various\nFigure 5. Residues in or near the active site with statistically\nsignificantly different predicted pK\na\nvalues between examples with low\npH activity and those with activity at higher pH, mapped to the\nstructure of TEP109. All residue positions are given relative to the\nMSA alignment. The difference in predicted pK\na\nmean values between\nthose groups where it was found to be statistically significant is given\nin the third row. These include the proton transferring histidine\n(H384, teal), catalytic aspartate (D352, pink), and a histidine (H300,\norange) directly adjacent to the catalytic serine (S301, purple). Three\nother residues within 15 \u00c5 that are often or sometimes charged are\nhighlighted (alignment positions: E224 (green), D383 (black), Q378\n(yellow)). AlphaFold3 prediction was used to \u201cdock\u201d a trimer of PET\n(blue), and all distances (\u00c5) shown use the TEP109 predicted\nstructure.\n57\nTEP109 is the top performing candidate at pH 4.5 and\none of a very small number to exhibit E224 and an uncharged amino\nacid at alignment position 378.\nTable 3.

First, we tested \u201ctuning\u201d the HMMs by adding\ncandidates that exhibited activity at the target condition,\ntesting in 5-fold cross validation. We were able to increase\nperformance by more than 0.05 AUROC for multiple\nconditions by tuning HMMs with data from our assay. The\neffect of tuning each HMM across conditions is shown in\nFigure S10. Notably, HMM-17 exhibited a pronounced\nimprovement compared to the larger HMMs, which were\nsaturated with PET hydrolases not necessarily active under the\ncondition of interest. These results suggest that HMM searches\ncould benefit from using a smaller, more targeted set of\nenzymes tested at the specific condition, rather than\nconstructing large alignments based on data collected across\nvarying conditions.\nNext, we used the data collected in this study to train\nsupervised models, like the activity predictor used in Round 3,\nin cross validation for each condition. We compared the\nperformance of these models against HMM-17, tuned HMM-\n17, and the supervised model trained on literature data and\nused in Round 2. Figure 6A and Table S7 show the\nperformance of all models for conditions where at least 10\nactive enzymes were found. Other conditions are not included\nas not enough data were available. In general, we see that for\nconditions where we collected more data (cryPow, 40 \u00b0C, pH\n4.5\u22127.5), the tuned and supervised models performed better\n(at least 0.1 AUROC increase) compared to the starting\nHMM-17 or the Round 2 supervised predictor (\u201clit.\nsupervised\u201d). Furthermore, supervised training consistently\noutperformed HMM tuning. For some conditions, (such as\ncryPow and pH < 6), HMM-17 performs no better than\nrandom; however, the condition-specific supervised models\ncan salvage AUROC of up to 0.8. There is a clear decrease in\nsupervised model performance for conditions where fewer\nenzymes were tested, with some instances where performance\nwas lower than the starting HMMs. These results suggest that\nfor mining enzyme sequences for specific activities, exper-\nimental measurements at a condition of interest for a starting\nset of homologs should be used to evaluate supervised\nperformance compared to the HMM. Once supervised\nperformance is greater than the HMM alone, such predictors\nshould be used to filter searches in a feedback loop.\nFinally, we investigated whether these supervised models\nhad the potential to improve hit rates if applied to search for\nnovel enzyme candidates by evaluating their performance on\nthe existing data set. Figure 6B presents the model predictions\ncompared to observed activity in cross-validation for\nconditions with high-performing models (cryPow, 40 \u00b0C,\n4.5\u22127.5). Figure S11 shows performance for all models. We set\nthe decision boundary at the default threshold of 0.5, with\nthose enzymes classified higher predicted as \u201cactive\u201d and lower\npredicted as \u201cinactive\u201d. We observed for each condition a high\nprecision score (the proportion of true positive predictions out\nof all positive predictions made by the model) of >75%.\nSpecifically, for cryPow, 40 \u00b0C, pH 5.5, the precision score was\n75%, which represents a putative increase in hit rate of +25%\nfrom the observed hit rate in Round 3, which used fewer\ntraining data and did not distinguish between conditions, and\n+55% compared to Round 1, which did not use condition-\nspecific assay data (Figure 2D). The results indicate that\nsupervised models have strong potential for identifying\nhomologues while minimizing the screening of inactive\nenzymes.\n\u25a0"
