Actinobacteria, known for p roducing enzymes involved in 42 \nthe degradation of complex organic molecules, are of particular  interest due to their potential 43 \nto produce PET degrading enzymes. The highly thermostable enzym e, leaf-branch compost 44 \ncutinase (LCC) found in  Actinobacteria is one such example. This work expands on the 45 \ndiscovery and characterization of new PET degrading enzymes fro m Microbispora, 46 \nNonomuraea, and Micromonospora genus. Within this genus, we analyzed enzymes from the 47 \npolyesterase-lipase-cutinase family, which have ~60% similarity  to LCC , whe re  one  of the 48 \nenzymes was found to be capable of breaking down PET and BHET at 45-50 \u00b0C. Moreover, 49 \nwe were able to enhance the enzyme's depolymerization rate thro ugh further engineering, 50 \nresulting in a two-fold increase in activity. 51 \n 52 \nIMPORTANCE The proliferation of PET plastic waste poses a significant thre at to human 53 \nand environmental health, making it an issue of increasing concern. In response to this 54 \nchallenge, scientists are investigating eco-friendly approaches , such as bioprocessing and 55 \nmicrobial factories, to sustainably manage the growing quantity  of plastic waste in our 56 \necosystem.

The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of 58 \nthis group of enzymes by identifying and characterizing novel o nes that can facilitate the 59 \nbreakdown of PET waste.

With an estimated production of at least 1 million PET bottles 65 \nevery minute (2) and a global recycling rate of 9% (3) , the rapid and large accumulation of 66 \nnon-biodegradable post-consumer PET waste either end up in land fills, terrestrial or aquatic 67 \nenvironment. These PET that end up in the terrestrial or aquati c environment not only have a 68 \nslow rate of decomposition, but can also subsequently enter the  marine ecosystem as 69 \nmicroplastics - posing risks to the environment and the health of both animals and humans (4, 70 \n5). Consequently, addressing the PET waste crisis is imperative  for both environmental and 71 \nhealth sustainability. Traditional solid waste treatment method s, such as landfill and 72 \nincineration, have limitations in terms of secondary pollution and limited land resources. The 73 \nmain thermomechanical and chemical recycling methods are energy -intensive, requiring high 74 \ntemperatures, and can result in alterations to the properties o f the PET plastic (6). Thus, there 75 \nis a growing interest in less energy-intensive or \"natural\" met hods for processing this 76 \nmaterial.  77 \n 78 \nThe discovery of the first PET degrading enzyme PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 79 \n(IsPETase) (7, 8) in 2016, gave hopes to a biological solution through enzymes and microbial 80 \nfactories for processing this inert plastic. Enzyme-catalyzed P ET recycling or bioprocessing 81 \ncan proceed under mild reaction conditions, with minimal energy  and chemical usage. This 82 \nmethod of recycling is thus a more environmentally responsible alternative to petroleum-83 \nderived production processes. To  i m p r o v e  P E T a s e  t o w a r d s  p r a c t i cal application, there has 84 \nbeen numerous studies reporting more thermostable and active ve rsions of the enzyme (9). 85 \nSince then, various PET degradation enzymes have also been identified, including CALB 86 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

According to the Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy),  there 88 \nare ~3000 homologs of PET-active enzymes by profile hidden Markov models (12).  89 \n 90 \nActinobacteria is a diverse group of bacteria known to produce a wide range of enzymes that 91 \nare utilized in various industria l and medical applications, such as antibiotic production and 92 \ndegradation of environmental contaminants (13, 14). In particul ar, the actinobacteria are of 93 \ninterest due to their ability to produce cutinases and hydrolas es, enzymes involved in the 94 \ndegradation of complex organic molecules and synthesis of essential nutrients (14). One of 95 \nthe most outstanding and highly thermostable PET degrading enzy mes found in the 96 \nactinobacteria is the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC), which  was mined from 97 \nmetagenomes (15). A recent report by Erickson et.al on another PET degrading enzyme 98 \nwithin the actinobacteria famil y, further underscores the poten tial of actinobacteria as a 99 \nsource for PET depolymerization. Given the capabilities of acti nobacteria in PET 100 \ndepolymerization, this study aim to explore other actinobacteri a for new PET degrading 101 \nenzymes (16). 102 \n 103 \nIn this work, we expand the enzymes for PET breakdown from acti nobacteria through the 104 \ndiscovery, engineering, and characterization of new and unexplo red PET degrading enzymes 105 \nfrom Microbispora, Nonomuraea, Micromonospora genus.   106 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a\nwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Subsequently these purified enzymes were  characterized for BHET 197 \nbreakdown at 50\u00b0C and PET breakdown at both 45 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C. 198 \n 199 \nDuring BHET hydrolysis (50 \u00b0C, pH  7), we observed detrimental e ffects of ICC mutations 200 \nwhich are however restored with N246M mutation (Fig. 5a). Under these conditions, there 201 \nare minimal differences between native and engineered enzymes. However, using low 202 \ncrystallinity PET (lcPET) substrates at 45 \u00b0C, there appears to  be significant improvement of 203 \nSIBER 822 over the native enzymes over one week (Fig. 5). At 65  \u00b0 C ,  n o  P E T  204 \ndepolymerization was observed for both enzymes. Our observation s suggest that, despite not 205 \nbeing enough to increase its working temperature, the addition of a di-sulfide bridge to 206 \nSIBER 1 resulted in potentially better stability at 45\u00b0C over 1  week when compared to its 207 \nnative enzyme. Although this is lower than optimized LCC (9) wh ich yield PET 208 \ndepolymerization of 40% after 48 hours (Fig. S7), it is still e ncouraging to note that SIBER 209 \n822 is significantly more active than IsPETase double mutant (24) (~0.08%-0.09% at 48 210 \nhours, Table S4).  We anticipate that the further improvement o f the enzyme towards 211 \npractical applications will necessitate the implementation of a dditional engineering 212 \ntechniques, such as directed evolution and computational design. 213 \n214 \nFigure 5.

      "text": "This study aims to deepen the understanding of PET-degrading en zymes by identifying and 220 \ndescribing new ones that can aid in PET waste biodegradation. A lthough some PET-221 \ndegrading enzymes are known, their rarity restricts the utilization of it. Even with the addition 222 \nof 34 more recently characterized PET degrading enzymes from th e actinobacteria family 223 \n(16), this still adds up to only a few dozen of verified PET-active enzymes (12). Exploring a 224 \nnew genus space, we found hydrolases that have varying specific ities towards substrates 225 \nBHET, MHET, and even PET. Within representative four sequences, we have uncovered and 226 \ncharacterized a new thermostable PETase within the genus of Microbispora, Nonomuraea, 227 \nand Micromonospora genus. Furthermore, despite sharing only 60% homology with LCC, we 228 \ndiscovered that incorporating similar mutations previously used in the engineering of LCC 229 \n(9) could improve SIBER 171's activity and stability. The engin eered enzyme (SIBER 822) 230 \nexhibited over two-fold improvement for lcPET depolymerization compared to its wild type. 231 \n 232 \nTo date, there are over 2000 known PET homologs and several enz yme engineering studies 233 \nhave proposed targeted mutations to improve thermostability, ac tivity, and accessibility to 234 \nPET. The results of this work raise questions about the factors  that determine a PETase and 235 \nthe relationship between thermostability and PET degradation ef ficiency, especially in light 236 \nof the impact of the substrate's physical properties (25), such  as crystallinity. Among the four 237 \nenzymes, there were notable differences and correlations in sol ubility and expression yields 238 \nand activity. Here, among the SIBER 1-4 genes, SIBER 1 construc ts had consistent higher 239 \nprotein expression yields. After engineering of SIBER 171, we also observed significant 240 \nexpression yield increase in engineered SIBER 822. This is cons istent with the discussions of 241 \ncorrelations between protein folding and protein activity, wher e the thermodynamics of the 242 \nsequences may play a role in pr oper and accurate folding (26).
