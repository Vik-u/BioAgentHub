      "text": "CNN model\nMutCompute24 is a three-dimensional CNN (3DCNN) model in which \nthe architecture consists of nine layers divided into two blocks:  \n(1) feature extraction and (2) classification. The feature extraction block \nconsisted of six layers: two pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by \na dimension reduction max pooling layer after each pair. The first pair \nof convolutional layers used filters of size 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093 and the second pair \nhad filters of size 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092. For the first pair, the convolutional layers had \n100 and 200 filters and for the second pair, the convolutional layers \nhad 200 and 400 filters.\u00a0Furthermore, the rectified linearity unit func-\ntion (Relu) was applied to the output of the four convolutional layers. \nThe final feature maps generated by the feature extraction block had \ndimensions of size 400\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093. These feature maps were flattened \ninto a one-dimensional vector of size 10,800 before being passed to \nthe classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully \nconnected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2 and 0, respec-\ntively. Like the feature extraction block, the output of the first two dense \nlayers was transformed by the Relu function. T o obtain a vector of 20 \nprobability scores representing the network prediction for each of the \namino acids, we applied a softmax activation function to the output of \nthe third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a machine learning \nas a service on https://mutcompute.com.\nMutCompute predictions\nMutCompute predictions were obtained by running the WT PETase \n(PDB ID 5XJH) and ThermoPETase (PDB ID 6IJ6) through our machine \nlearning as a service at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered \nby sorting by the probability assigned to the WT amino acid. We filtered \n34 and 39 residues from the WT PETase and ThermoPETase crystal struc-\ntures, respectively. From these filtered residues, we assigned priority \nto our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the ten residues from \neach crystal structure with the highest log2 fold change between the \npredicted amino acid and WT amino acid probabilities. Before experi-\nmentation, selected residues were visualized with MutCompute-View, \nwhich is built on top of NGL Viewer (https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl), \nto ensure three things: (1) the prediction was chemically sound and \nnot because of a crystal or model artefact, (2) we were avoiding the \nactive site and binding pocket and (3) avoiding epistatic interactions \nbetween predictions and instead targeting predicted \u2018instability hot-\nspots\u2019 . MutCompute-View has been made publicly available at https://\nmutcompute.com/view.\nProtein crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, data \nprocessing and model refinement\nT o identify crystallization conditions for FAST-PETase, a sample con-\ntaining 6\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 purified FAST-PETase was screened in sparse-matrix \nscreening using Phoenix robotic system (Art Robinson). The initial hits \nwere identified with the rod-shaped crystals formed after incubating \nscreening plates at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009days. The crystallization was optimized \nas 0.1\u2009M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH\u20095.5 setup as sitting-drop \nvapour diffusion.\nIndividual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid \nnitrogen after cryoprotected with 30% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction \ndata were collected at the 23-ID-B beamline in the Advance Photon \nSource. The X-ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44\u2009\u00c5 resolution \nfor FAST-PETase crystals using HKL2000 (ref. 30). The structure was \nsolved by molecular replacement with ThermoPETase structure as the \ninitial search model (PDB code 6IJ6, ref. 17). The molecular replacement \nsolution for FAST-PETase structure was iteratively built and refined \nusing Coot31 and the Phenix32 refinement package. Procheck and Mol-\nProbity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST-PETase structure. \nThe final statistics for data collection and structural determination \nare shown in Extended Data Table\u00a01.\nCloning\nGenes encoding I. sakaiensis 201-F6 IsPETase (WT PETase) (accession \nnumber: A0A0K8P6T7), its mutants\u2014PETase S121E/D186H/R280A  (Ther -\nmoPETase17) and PETaseS214H/I168R/W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/T140D \n(DuraPETase22), cutinase-like enzyme, from S. AHK190 (ref. 25) (Cut190) \n(accession number:\u00a0BAO42836), LCC (accession number: G9BY57) \nand its mutant LCCF243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM)12\u2014were commercially \nsynthesized for cloning. T o enable extracellular expression of PETase \nand its mutants in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the \nnucleotide sequence of the signal peptide SPpstu (21 amino acids) from \nmaltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-19 (ref. 33)  \nwas used to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 \namino acids) of WT PETase. The WT PETase and its mutants\u2019 genes \nwith SPpstu presented at the N terminus were amplified by polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subse-\nquently, using the Gibson Assembly method, DNA fragments encoding \nWT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were subcloned into a \nmodified pBTK552 vector34 in which the antibiotic resistance marker \nwas swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a \nC-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence was added. T o enable \nintracellular expression of Cut190, LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli \n(DE3) (New England Biolabs), the nucleotide sequence encoding the \noriginal signal peptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The \nCut190, LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide sequence were \namplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, \nusing Gibson Assembly method, the DNA fragments encoding Cut190, \nLCC and ICCM were subcloned into a commercial vector-pET -21b (Nova-\ngen), which carries a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence. \nThe electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10\u03b2 was transformed with the \nGibson Assembly product by following a standard electroporation \nprotocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was extracted from \nthe overnight culture of the cloning host by using the QIAprep Spin \nMiniprep kit (Qiagen). The DNA sequence of the extracted plasmid \nwas verified by Sanger sequencing. A list of nucleotide sequences and \nexpressed amino acid sequences of the genes used in the study is pro-\nvided in\u00a0Supplementary Methods.\nVariant construction\nVariants of WT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were generated \nthrough site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR method described in \nthe Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit E0552S (New England Biolabs). \nThe constructed plasmids carrying WT PETase, ThermoPETase and \nDuraPETase genes were used as the templates for mutagenesis PCR \nreaction. The corresponding primer sequences and annealing tem-\nperature were designed and generated by using the NEBaseChanger \ntool. Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech Laboratories) were used as \nthe cloning host and transformed with the ligated plasmids using the \nheat-shock method provided in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Plas-\nmid extraction and sequencing for the variants were performed under \nthe same conditions as described for plasmids carrying WT PETase, \nThermoPETase and DuraPETase genes.\nProtein expression and purification\nFor extracellular protein expression of WT PETase, ThermoPETase, \nDuraPETase and their variants, P . putida KT2440 was used as the expres-\nsion host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed with the cor-\nresponding constructed plasmids. For intracellular protein expression \nof Cut190, LCC, ICCM and their variants, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as \nthe expression host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed \nwith the corresponding constructed plasmids. A single colony of an  \nP . putida KT2440 or E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain harbouring one of the con-\nstructed plasmids was inoculated into 2\u2009ml of Luria Bertani medium \nwith 50\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u22121 kanamycin and grown overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C/225\u2009r.p.m. The \novernight-grown culture (using 150\u2009\u00b5l) was scaled up with 1,000-fold \ndilution in a 500-ml triple baffled shake flask and grown to a cell density \nof 0.8 (optical density (OD600)) at 37\u2009\u00b0C/225\u2009r.p.m. Protein expression was \ninduced by adding 0.2\u2009mM of isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside \nand cells were cultured for 24\u2009h at 30\u2009\u00b0C/225\u2009r.p.m. For isolation of the \nextracellularly expressed PETase enzymes, the induced cell culture was \ncentrifuged at 14,000g and 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min to obtain the supernatant \nthat accommodates secretory protein. For isolation of the intracellularly \nexpressed Cut190, LCC and ICCM, the induced cell culture was collected \nby centrifugation at 4,000g and 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. Cell pellets were then \nresuspended in 25\u2009ml of Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) \n(Thermo Fisher Scientific) pH\u20097.0 buffer containing 10\u2009mM imidazole, \n1\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 lysozyme and 5\u2009\u00b5l of Pierce Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher \nScientific), followed by mixing on a rocker for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Subse-\nquently, cells were lysed by sonication and the resulting cell lysate was \ncentrifuged at 14,000g and 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min to obtain the supernatant \nthat contains soluble proteins. Target proteins from the above two types \nof supernatant were both purified by HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo \nFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Desalt-\ning of the protein eluent was carried out by using Sephadex G-25 PD-10 \ncolumns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \nAll purification and desalting steps were performed at 4\u2009\u00b0C in a cold \nroom. Afterwards, the purified protein was concentrated to a final vol-\nume of 1\u2009ml by the 50\u2009ml, 10-kDa cut-off Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter \ndevice (EMD Millipore Corporation) and preserved in DPBS (pH\u20097.0). \nThe protein concentration was then determined by using the Coomas-\nsie Plus Bradford Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Infinite \nM200 PRO microplate reader (T ecan) to measure the absorbance of \nassay mixtures. The presence and purity of the purified proteins were \nassessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nIn\u00a0vitro analysis of PET-hydrolytic activity using commercial \nGoodfellow PET film (gf-PET)\nT o evaluate the PET-hydrolytic activity of PETase and its variants, \nthe homogenous amorphous gf-PET film (Goodfellow, US 577-529-\n50; specification: 1.3\u20131.4\u2009g\u2009cm\u22123 density, 1.58\u20131.64 refractive index, \n100\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221213\u2009cm3. cm\u2009cm \u22122\u2009s\u22121\u2009Pa\u22121 permeability to water at 25\u2009\u00b0C, \n20\u201380\u2009\u00d7\u20090\u22126\u2009K\u22121 coefficient of thermal expansion, 0.13\u20130.15\u2009W\u2009m\u22121\u2009K\u22121 \nat 23\u2009\u00b0C thermal conductivity) was used as the substrate for degradation \nassays with the purified PETase enzyme and its variants. The gf-PET film \nwas prepared in a circular form (6\u2009mm in diameter, roughly 11.4\u2009mg) and \nwas washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol and deionized water \nbefore usage. Subsequently, the gf-PET film was put into a glass test \ntube and fully submerged in 600\u2009\u00b5l of 100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer \n(pH\u20098.0) with 200\u2009nM purified enzyme. The test tube was tightly capped \nand wrapped with parafilm to minimize volatilization. The reaction \nmixture was then incubated at 30, 40, 50, 55 and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 96\u2009h. Fol-\nlowed by removing the enzyme-treated gf-PET film from the reaction \nmixture, the enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 85\u2009\u00b0C for \n20\u2009min. The reaction mixture samples were then centrifuged at 10,000g \nfor 5\u2009min. The supernatant of each sample was further analysed by \nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantifying PET \nmonomers released from the PET depolymerization.\nT o compare the PET-hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase with WT PETase, \nThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM across a range of pH (6.5\u20138.0) \nat 30 and 40\u2009\u00b0C, a similar experimental setup was used. The circular \ngf-PET film (6\u2009mm diameter, roughly 11.4\u2009mg) was used as the substrate. \nThe enzyme reactions were performed with 200\u2009nM purified enzyme in \n600\u2009\u00b5l of 100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer with various pH values (6.5, 7.0, \n7.5 or 8.0) at 30 and 40\u2009\u00b0C. After incubating the enzyme reaction for 96\u2009h, \nthe supernatant of the reaction mixture was also analysed by HPLC for \nquantifying PET monomers released from the PET depolymerization.\nDepolymerization of pc-PET plastics\nHole-punched pc-PET films (6\u2009mm in diameter) from 51 postconsumer \nplastic products were serially treated by 200\u2009nM FAST-PETase in 600\u2009\u00b5l \nof 100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) at 50\u2009\u00b0C. Fresh enzyme solu-\ntion was replenished every 22\u2009h to maximize enzymatic depolym -\nerization rate for degrading the 51 samples of various pc-PET films.  \nThe supernatant of the enzymatic hydrolysate of the PET samples was \nanalysed by HPLC for quantifying PET monomers released throughout \nthe whole depolymerization process.\nThe time-course analysis of degrading a pc-PET film (Bean cake con-\ntainer) by various PHEs was conducted at 50\u2009\u00b0C. The reactions were \nperformed with 200\u2009nM enzyme in 600\u2009\u00b5l of 100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH \nbuffer (pH\u20098.0) and terminated at 6, 12, 18 or 24\u2009h for quantifying total \nPET monomers released at each time point.\nA large, untreated and transparent pc-PET (Bean cake container, \nroughly 6.4\u2009g) was treated by 200\u2009nM of FAST-PETase in 100\u2009mM of \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) at 50\u2009\u00b0C. The whole piece of transpar-\nent PET container was fully submerged in 2.5\u2009l of enzyme solution and \ncompletely degraded after 48\u2009h.\nDepolymerization of an untreated water bottle\nT o depolymerize an untreated water bottle, fragments were cut out or \nhole-punched from various sections (finish/neck, shoulder, body, tran-\nsition to base, base, base centre) of an untreated water bottle (500\u2009ml, \nCG Roxane LLC.). The fragments were fully submerged in 600\u2009\u00b5l of \n100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) with 200\u2009nM purified enzyme. \nThe depolymerization was conducted at 50, 60 and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h.\nPET water bottle thermal pretreatment\nPET water bottles (500\u2009ml, CG Roxane LLC.) were heated at 290\u2009\u00b0C \non a hot plate covered with aluminium foil. Once PET was melted \n(about 1\u2009min), another piece of aluminium foil was placed on top \nof the melted PET. A stainless-steel cylinder (diameter 6\u2009cm, weight \n616\u2009g) was used to press the melted PET into a film with a flat surface. \nAfter pressing for 1\u2009min, the stainless-steel cylinder was lifted and \nthe PET film was heated again at 290\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. After heating, the \nhot PET films covered with the aluminium foil was rapidly cooled in \nan ice bath. After cooling, the reprocessed PET films were peeled off \nfrom the aluminium foil.\nMeanwhile, a treated but more highly crystalline film can also be \nproduced through a slight modification (after pressing the melted PET \nfilms for 1\u2009min by the cylinder, the films were directly quenched by an \nice bath without the reheating step) of the above protocol.\nDepolymerization of a pretreated water bottle\nT o depolymerize pretreated water bottle films, circular films (6\u2009mm \nin diameter; roughly 25\u2009mg) were hole-punched from the pretreated \nwater bottle and treated by 200\u2009nM of various PHEs in 600\u2009\u00b5l of 100\u2009mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) at temperatures ranging from 50 to 72\u2009\u00b0C \nfor 24\u2009h.\nT o completely depolymerize a pretreated whole water bottle), the \nmelted plastic pucks from an entire water bottle (500\u2009ml; roughly \n9\u2009g, CG Roxane LLC.) were cut into small rectangular flakes (roughly \n1\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm). The resulting flakes were then fully submerged in 200\u2009ml of \nenzyme solution that contained 200\u2009nM of FAST-PETase in 100\u2009mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0). Depolymerization was conducted at \n50\u2009\u00b0C and fresh enzyme solution was replenished every 24\u2009h to maxi-\nmize the enzymatic depolymerization rate.\nDepolymerization of polyester products\nFive different commercial polyester products were cut into small \npieces and used as the substrates that were fully submerged in 600\u2009\u00b5l \nof 100\u2009mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) with 200\u2009nM purified enzyme. \nEnzyme treatment on these five polyester products was conducted \nat 50\u2009\u00b0C. After 24\u2009h of incubation, the reaction was terminated. The \nenzyme degradation solution was used to determine how much PET \nmonomers were released from hydrolysing these polyester products \nby various PHEs.\nArticle\nDepolymerization of large, untreated pc-PET container and \nregeneration of virgin PET\nA large, untreated, and green coloured pc-PET container was cut into \nsmall rectangular flakes (roughly 1\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm). Then 3.0\u2009g of the coloured \npc-PET flakes was serially treated by 200\u2009nM FAST-PETase in 100\u2009mM \nKH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH\u20098.0) at 50\u2009\u00b0C. 200\u2009nM of fresh enzyme was \nadded to the degradation solution every 24\u2009h to maximize enzymatic \ndegradation rate. All the coloured pc-PET fragments were completely \ndegraded after 6\u2009days.\nOn completion of degradation, the enzyme degradation solution was \nfiltered and the filtrate was collected for regeneration. The pH of the \nfiltrate was adjusted to pH\u200911 with NaOH to hydrolyse remaining MHET. \nThe solution was stirred at room temperature for 4\u2009h to complete the \nhydrolysis. The pH of the solution was subsequently adjusted to 2 with \n37% HCl. The precipitate was filtered and washed several times with \ndeionized water and dried under vacuum overnight. Then 4.3\u2009g of TPA \nwas collected and used in the next step without further purification. \nSettings used for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were 400\u2009MHz, \nd6-DMSO: 8.03\u2009ppm (s, 4H).\nT o a suspension of TPA (4.31\u2009g, 25.9\u2009mmol) in CH3OH (150\u2009ml), 95%\u2009H2SO4 \n(2.0\u2009ml) was added dropwise at room temperature. The mixture was \nstirred at reflux for 24\u2009h and became a clear solution. The reaction mixture \nwas then cooled to room temperature. Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) was \nsubsequently recrystallized from the reaction mixture and collected after \nfiltration. These white crystals were washed with cold CH3OH and dried \nunder vacuum for 4\u2009h to afford DMT (4.12\u2009g) with a yield of 82%. 1H NMR \n(400\u2009MHz, CDCl3): 8.08\u2009ppm (s, 4H), 3.93\u2009ppm (s, 6H).\nT o a three-necked round bottom flask equipped with an air con-\ndenser, DMT (4.12\u2009g, 21.1\u2009mmol) was added. The flask was evacuated \nunder vacuum and refilled with nitrogen gas for three times. Ethyl -\nene glycol (1.20\u2009ml, 21.5\u2009mmol) was added, followed by the addition of \ntitanium isopropoxide (0.06\u2009ml, 0.21\u2009mmol). The mixture was stirred \nat 160\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h, 200\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h and 210\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h under nitrogen.  \nThe reaction temperature was further increased to 260\u2009\u00b0C, and high \nvacuum was applied to remove unreacted monomers. The mixture was \nstirred at 260\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h and then cooled to room temperature. The result-\ning PET was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, 10\u2009ml) \nand added dropwise to CH3OH to remove the catalyst. PET (2.83\u2009g) was \ncollected as white solids after centrifuging and dried under vacuum.\nGravimetric determination of the degraded pc-PET film\nThe intact pc-PET film was washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol \nand deionized water followed by drying the samples under vacuum \nat 30\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h before gravimetric measurement. After enzymatic \ntreatment, the degraded pc-film followed the same washing and drying \nprocedure before gravimetric measurement. The weights of the pc-PET \nfilm before and after enzyme treatment were compared to determine \nthe weight loss of the degraded pc-PET film.\nAnalytical method for measuring PET monomers released\nHPLC was used to analyse the PET monomers TPA and MHET released \nfrom PET depolymerization. The assay samples were filtered with \n0.2-\u00b5m nylon syringe filters (Wheaton Science) before running HPLC. \nMeasurement of TPA and MHET was performed using a Dionex Ulti-\nMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse \nPlus C18 column (3.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm2, 3.5\u2009\u00b5m) with detection wavelength \nat 260\u2009nm. Column oven was held at 30\u2009\u00b0C with 1% acetic acid in water \nor 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase over the course of the \n30-min sequence under the following conditions: 1 to 5% organic (vol/\nvol) for 5\u2009min, 5 to 100% organic (vol/vol) for 8\u2009min, 100% organic (vol/\nvol) for 10\u2009min and 100 to 5% organic for 2\u2009min followed by 5% organic \nfor 5\u2009min. The flow rate was fixed at 0.8\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121. A standard curve was \nprepared using commercial TPA with\u2009\u226599.0% purity (Thermo Fisher \nScientific) or MHET\u2009\u226597.0% purity (Advanced ChemBlocks Inc.).\nAnalytical method for measuring melting temperature (Tm) of \nproteins\nT o evaluate the thermostability of WT PETase and its variants, differential \nscanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine their respective Tm.  \nPurified protein samples were concentrated to roughly 300\u2013500\u2009\u00b5M \nusing Microcon Centrifugal Filter 10K Devices (Millipore). Then 10\u2009\u00b5l \nof concentrated protein solution (DPBS buffer pH\u20097.0) was placed \nin an aluminium Tzero pan and sealed with a Tzero hermetic lid (TA \nInstruments). Tm of the protein samples was analysed by a DSC250 (TA \nInstruments) with a RCS90 electric chiller. Two DSC procedures were \nused depending on the anticipated denaturation temperature of the \nprotein. The first DSC method heated from 40 to 90\u2009\u00b0C at 10\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121, \nheld at 90\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, then cooled from 90 to 40\u2009\u00b0C at \u221210\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121. \nThe second method heated from 20 to 70\u2009\u00b0C at 10\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121, held at 70\u2009\u00b0C \nfor 2\u2009min and cooled from 70 to 40\u2009\u00b0C at \u221210\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121. The denaturation \ntemperature of the proteins was measured on the heating ramp trace \nas the midpoint value at half-height.\nAnalytical method for determining PET film crystallinity\nDSC was used to determine the percentage crystallinity of the PET \nfilms hole-punched from the postconsumer plastics. PET film samples \n(4\u201310.5\u2009mg) were placed in aluminium Tzero pans with a Tzero solid \nsample lid. Samples were first heated from 40 to 300\u2009\u00b0C at 5\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min, \nheld at 300\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, cooled from 300 to 30\u2009\u00b0C at \u20135\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121 and \nheld at 30\u2009\u00b0C for 1 min in a DSC250 (TA Instruments) with a RCS90 elec-\ntric chiller. The percentage crystallinity was determined on the first \nheating scan using the enthalpies of melting and cold crystallization. \nThe equation used to calculate percentage crystallinity within the PET \nfilm was the following\n\u0394H \u0394H\n\u0394H%crystallinity = \u2212 \u00d71 00mc c\nm\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\nwhere \u0394Hm is the enthalpy of melting ( J\u2009g\u22121), \u0394Hcc is the enthalpy of cold \ncrystallization ( J\u2009g\u22121), and \u0394Hm is the enthalpy of melting for a 100% \ncrystalline PET sample, which is 140.1\u2009J\u2009g\u22121 (refs. 12,22). \u0394Hm and \u0394Hcc were \nmeasured by integrating from 90\u2013100\u2009\u00b0C to roughly 260\u2009\u00b0C with a linear \nbaseline. The percentage crystallinity was calculated using the TRIOS \nsoftware package. The glass transition temperatures of the PET films \nwere measured using the second heating scan: 30\u2013300 at 10\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\n\u22121, \nheld at 300\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min and then 300\u201340\u2009\u00b0C at \u221210\u2009\u00b0C\u2009min\u22121. The glass \ntransition temperatures for all the PET films were between 80 and 82\u2009\u00b0C.\nGel permeation chromatography (GPC)\nGPC measurement was performed at an on an Agilent system with \na 1260 Infinity isocratic pump, degasser and thermostated column \nchamber held at 30\u2009\u00b0C. A mixture of chloroform with 50\u2009ppm amylene \nand 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (2.0\u2009vol%) was used as the mobile \nphase at 0.5\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121. Molecular weights (Mn, Mw) and polydispersity \nindices (\u00d0) were determined relative to polystyrene standards. For \nsample preparation for GPC, about 8\u2009mg of PET was dissolved in 0.15\u2009ml \n1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Once PET was completely dissolved, \nchloroform was added to make a total volume of 2.50\u2009ml. The solution \nwas filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with a pore \nsize of 0.45\u2009\u00b5m. Then 100\u2009\u00b5l of the sample solution was injected into \nthe GPC system.\nSEM\nPET films were mounted onto a 3.2-mm SEM stub using carbon tape. \nSamples were sputter coated with 8-nm platinum/palladium using \na Cressington 208HR Sputter Coater. The metal was sputter coated \nonto the sample by means of plasma generated with argon present in \nthe chamber. SEM imaging was performed under vacuum using a Zeiss \nSupra40 SEM. The electron beam intensity was 5\u2009kV.\nAFM\nAFM was performed on an Aylum MFP-3D atomic force microscope \n(Asylum Research) in tapping mode. Images were recorded after a \nsurface scan on an area of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u00b5m2. Image analysis, including his-\ntograms and surface roughness, was performed using Igor Pro.\nNMR spectroscopy\n1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at a 400\u2009MHz Bruker AVANCE \nNEO spectrometer at room temperature in CDCl3 or d6-DMSO. Chemical \nshift was referenced to the residual solvent signal (1H NMR: 7.26\u2009ppm \nin CDCl3, 2.50\u2009ppm in d6-DMSO, respectively).\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature \nResearch Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\nData availability"
