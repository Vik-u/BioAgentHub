It has also been suggested that as the\nsubstrate of this reaction is non-aqueous, classical Michaelis\u2013\nMenten kinetics cannot be used to relate reaction rates to\ncalculated energy barriers.\n[25]\nThese energy barriers calculated in this work are suitably\nlow to suggest that none of the hydrolysis steps catalysed by Is-\nPETase constitute its rate-limiting step. By a process of\nelimination, this leaves either substrate binding or product\nrelease as candidates for the rate limiting step. This is consistent\nwith the findings from site-directed mutagenesis studies, where\nthe largest improvements in enzyme activity were obtained\nthrough mutations that are thought to affect binding.\nIn several calculation steps starting from six MD snapshots,\nthe product geometry (Figure 2) was not found to be stable,\ninstead forming an alternate product state aPS (Figure 7). The\ncarboxylic moiety of the ligand was deprotonated, having\ntransferred to the side-chain oxygen of S131 causing the \u025b-\nnitrogen on H208 and the carboxyl of D177 to be protonated.\nThe energy of this state was calculated to be up to\n\u0000 137.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nmore stable relative to the geometry of\nintermediate 4 that preceded it (Figure 5). Subsequent MD\nsimulations of the aPS state revealed that the deprotonated\nproduct forms strong hydrogen bonds with the active site\nresidues (Figure 6). This caused the ligand to persist in the\nactive site for up to 1 ns. This tendency for the product to\ndeprotonate while inside the active site might thus result in a\nsubstantial energy barrier in the product release step of the\nreaction. This would significantly hinder the enzyme\u2019s catalytic\nefficiency."

Very low overall barriers are computed\nfor serine protease-type hydrolysis steps (as low as\n34.1 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\n). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final prod-\nuct, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force\nindicates that product release could be rate limiting.\nIntroduction\nIn 2016, a culture of bacteria was discovered near a recycling\nplant outside Sake city in Japan that could degrade the\ncommon pollutant PET.\n[1]\nThe bacterium responsible for this\nactivity was found to be Idonella sakaiensis. Using a pair of\nenzymes PETase and MHETase, this bacterium breaks PET into\nits monomers ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TA). It\nwas predicted that the organism catabolises TA for a source of\ncarbon and energy. X-ray crystallography revealed that Is-\nPETase (EC 3.1.1.101)\n[2]\nis a member of the \u03b1-\u03b2 hydrolase\nfamily,\n[3]\nwhile phylogenetic studies showed that Is-PETase\nbelongs to the cutinase family of enzymes. The chemical\nmechanism, based upon the structure (Figure 1) was proposed\nto follow two concerted nucleophilic substitution reactions,\nusing a catalytic triad motif conserved in related \u03b1-\u03b2\nhydrolases\n[4]\n(Figure 2).\nThere are several features of Is-PETase that have been\nshown to be important for the enzyme\u2019s ability to degrade PET\n(Figure 1). The active site is situated in a shallow groove in the\nenzyme\u2019s surface; in comparison to related cutinase enzymes,\nthis groove has been significantly enlarged and contains more\naromatic residues.\n[5]\nIt is thought that these factors assist with\nsubstrate binding. The active site is situated upon two loops, a\ndisulfide bridge that is not conserved in related enzymes has\nbeen shown to hold these two loops in position, whilst giving\nthe active site flexibility.\nSeveral enzymes had been reported to have PET degrada-\ntion activity before the discovery of Is-PETase. These enzymes\noriginated from thermophilic bacteria,\n[6]\nresulting in high\noptimum temperatures for enzymatic activity. It has been\nargued that reaction temperatures in excess of 60 \u00b0 C are\ndesirable in PETases, as this is the glass transition temperature\n(T\ng\n) of aqueous PET.\n[7]\nFor high temperature industrial enzymatic\nPET degradation, the thermophilic enzyme LCC\n[8]\nis the current\nfrontrunner. By contrast, Is-PETase operates most efficiently at\nmesophilic temperatures, outperforming all other PETases at\n30 \u00b0 C.\n[7]\nMesophilic activity makes Is-PETase a more practical\ncandidate for large-scale processes, such as waste stream\nmanagement, as it would be costly to heat such large systems.\nIs-PETase has potential to be expressed in a wider array of host\n[a] E.

The\naromatic ring of this moiety forms a \u03c0-stacking interaction with\nY59. The docking of 2PET and 3PET revealed the role of W156\nas it forms a \u03c0-stacking interaction with the second aromatic\nring of each ligand. It can be seen through comparison with the\nbinding mode of HEMT that W156 rotates its side chain to\naccommodate the longer chains of 2PET and 3PET. The\norientations of the catalytic residues S131, D177 and H208 and\nthe reactive ester bond remained consistent across the docking\ngeometries of HEMT, 2PET and 3PET. For this reason and to\nreduce calculation times, HEMT was chosen as the substrate\nmimic to be used in the rest of this study.\nThe binding pose used as a starting point for the\nsubsequent molecular dynamics simulation was selected for its\nsimilarity to binding pose found in the PDB structure 5XH3,\n[3]\nparticularly for the proximity of the ligand\u2019s carbonyl oxygen to\nthe backbone nitrogen in the oxyanion hole.\nQM/MM methods used to calculate the energy barriers of the\ndegradation of HEMT by Is-PETase\nStarting with an enzyme\u2013ligand complex generated by molec-\nular docking between Is-PETase and HEMT, the system was\nsolvated using a series of molecular dynamics simulations (see\nthe Supporting Information). Geometries for the intermediates\nalong the proposed reaction pathway (Figure 2) were generated\nthrough a series of restrained and unrestrained QM/MM\ngeometry optimisations. Geometries were generated sequen-\ntially (i. e., starting from previously optimised structures) to\nensure that geometries remained on the same reaction path-\nway. The transition state geometries in between these\nintermediates were then generated using the nudged elastic\nband (NEB) method. Once the geometries of intermediates and\ntransition states had been found, single-point calculations were\nperformed to refine their energies. This process was repeated\nusing seven different snapshots from the MD simulation to\nsample different conformations along the reaction pathway.\nThe resulting reaction pathways are therefore the result of the\ndiffering starting geometries obtained from MD simulations.\nFor the reaction NS1, the reaction pathway (red line in\nFigure 5, left) with the lowest overall energy barriers had an\nactivation energy of 28.9 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwith reaction step LgR1\nresponsible for the highest energy barrier. For the reaction NS2,\nthe reaction pathway with the lowest overall energy barriers\n(red line in Figure 5, right) had an activation energy of\n34.1 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwith reaction step Nuc2 responsible for the\nhighest energy barrier (Figures 2 and 5). Nuc2 has the highest\nactivation energy across reactions NS1 and NS2.\nThe step connecting intermediates I2 and I3 involves the\ndissociation of the EG leaving group present in I2, followed by\nthe association of a water molecule which will function as the\nnucleophile in Nuc2. The driving force for this step could not be\ncalculated with sufficient accuracy using our QM/MM protocol.\nIf the substrate exchange were endergonic (pushing the second\nprofile up relative to the first one) the predicted overall barrier\nwould increase correspondingly. However, seeing that EG and\nwater binding will be dominated by hydrogen-bonding inter-\nactions with similar strength, no significant driving force for this\nstep is to be expected. In addition, it is expected that the\ndissociation of EG will occur without any significant energy\nbarrier as the molecule forms no strong interactions with either\nthe active site of the enzyme or the bound ligand and no major\nrearrangement of the protein backbone is required to release\nthe product. The association of a water molecule into a\nnucleophilic position is similarly expected to occur without a\nsignificant energy barrier as H208 will readily form hydrogen\nbonds with bulk solvent in absence of EG in the active site. We\nthus assume that the two legs of the reaction in Figure 5 can be\nseamlessly connected and evaluate our overall barriers assum-\ning zero driving force for the EG/water exchange.\nThe geometry of the Nuc2 transition state shows some\nstabilisation of the formal negative charge that is forming on\nthe carbonyl oxygen of the substrate en route to the tetrahedral\nintermediate I4 (through hydrogen bonds involving backbone\nnitrogen atoms of Y58 and M132, with distances of 2.6 and\nFigure 3.

The latter distance is quite\nlong, suggesting less than optimal stabilisation in the TS (this\ndistance closes to 2.7 \u00c5 in the subsequent intermediate;\nFigure 6, bottom). The nucleophilic water molecule must be\ndeprotonated by H208 whilst having an orientation suitable for\nnucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon. To accommodate\nthis, a rotation of the side chain of S131 occurs, pulling the\ncarbonyl oxygen out of the oxyanion hole. (Figure 6). The width\nof the active site of Is-PETase does not permit the nucleophilic\nattack of water to occur whilst efficiently stabilising the\ndeveloping negative charge. Analysis of the transition states\nNuc1 and Nuc2 across each reaction pathway calculated\nrevealed that the degree of stabilisation of the negative charge\ndeveloping on the carbonyl oxygen of the ligand has the\nlargest effect on the activation energy of the corresponding\nreaction step. The same trend as discussed above holds for the\nset of Nuc1 and Nuc2 transition state geometries: The shorter\nthe M132 backbone nitrogen \u2013 ligand carbonyl oxygen in the\ntransition state, the lower the associated activation energy (R\n2\n=\n0.81 for Nuc1 and R\n2\n= 0.87 for Nuc2). Far weaker correlations\nwere found for the equivalent distance with the Y58 nitrogen.\nThis is due to this distance being consistently shorter, with less\nvariance. Plots of this data can be found in the Supporting\nInformation.\nThis might be an evolutionary compromise that has been\nmade as the expanded active site allows for better substrate\nbinding.\nNote that, in particular for step NS1, a notable spread of\nbarriers is computed for the pathways starting from different\nMD snapshots. However, even the largest overall barrier\nobtained for all pathways, 62.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\n, should be readily\nsurmountable at room temperature.\nThe barriers for our most favourable pathways are lower\nthan those reported in previous QM/MM studies (between ca.\n60\u201380 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nwhen using M06-2X and PBE functionals in the\nQM regions\n[20\u201322]\n). Our results therefore confirm previous\npredictions at the lower end of this range and, in view of the\nspread discussed above, highlight the need to trace multiple\npathways in order to avoid spuriously high barriers from a\nsingle one.\nFigure 5. Energy profiles calculated for the two reactions catalysed by Is-\nPETase (Figure 2), NS1 (top) and NS2 (bottom).
