To 113 \nmaximize diversity in the local sequence space around known PETases, such as TfCut2 and 114 \nLCC, we employed the recently described multiplexed ASR (mASR)36. In brief, mASR samples 115 \nmultiple statistically indifferent phylogenetic backgrounds from which to reconstruct ancestral 116 \nsequences from. This produces diverse libraries of ancestral proteins that span functional 117 \nsequence space over a distribution of realistic phylogenies. To achieve this, we performed 20 118 \nreplicates of maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference and ASR on a single dataset of 119 \n397 extant cutinases with significant homology to Tfcut2 and LCC (E -value <= 1E -5). 120 \nConsistent with previous phylogenetic studies37, PET hydrolytic cutinases were resolved as a 121 \npolyphyletic group of two monophyletic lineages: the Thermobifida sp.

Specifically, these nodes were chosen from the recent ancestors of the LCC 146 \nand TfCut2 lineages (or the most recent common ancestor of both), with at least a single 147 \nsequence sampled from each of the 20 distinct phylogenetic trees. Each ancestral sequence 148 \nwas selected as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence that maximizes the posterior 149 \nprobability over the full -length of the reconstructed protein. The variants were expressed, 150 \npurified and tested for PETase activity. The soluble expression level of each variant was 151 \nmeasured using the Bradford assay ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). PETase activity against 152 \namorphous PET film was measured by UV absorbance at 260 nm to detect the soluble 153 \nproducts of PET hydrolysis after the removal of undigested film, including terephthalic acid 154 \n(TPA), mono(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate 155 \n(BHET) ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). Among the extant cutinases, the highest PETase 156 \nactivities were observed for LCC (A 260 nm = 0.34 \u00b1 0.03), BhrPETase from bacterium HR29 157 \n(A260 nm = 0.49 \u00b1 0.01), and a previously engineered variant of LCC with the mutations 158 \nF243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G (LCC ICCG) 6 (A260 nm = 0.54 \u00b1 0.07), with other cutinases 159 \nshowing lower activity (Figure 1B). Of the 48 ancestral variants, we observed PETase activity 160 \nfor a number of ancestral cutinases from a diverse range of trees (Figure 1C). Several variants 161 \n(1_533, 35_442, 55_547, 70_439, 70_440, and 85_456) exhibited similar activity to the most 162 \nactive extant cutinases, LCC and BhrPETase. From this group, we selected ancestors from 163 \ntree 35, node 442 (35_442; A260 nm = 0.37 \u00b1 0.06) and tree 55, node 547 (55_547; A260 nm = 164 \n0.59 \u00b1 0.09), for further investigation. Notably, these two ancestors belonged to equivalent 165 \npositions from two independent phylogenetic trees (Figure 1D-F), representing the most 166 \nrecent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2, and sharing 98.5% sequence identity to one 167 \nanother.  168 \n 169 \nWithin the dataset of 48 ancestral sequences, 12 represent the same phylogenetic node (the 170 \nmost recent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2) over 12 different phylogenetic 171 \nbackgrounds. Of these, 9 exhibited PETase activity while 3 were inactive on PET. 172 \nInterestingly, the PETase ancestor 55_547 and the inactive ancestor 10_543 both represent 173 \nequivalent positions (the most recent common ancestor of TfCut2 and LCC) in their respective 174 \nphylogenetic backgrounds and differ by only 9/261 positions, yet 55_547 has activity against 175 \nPET and 10_543 does not. The functional differences between these sequences arise solely 176 \nfrom the topology of the phylogenetic tree used to reconstruct them and drastically alters how 177 \nthe evolution of PETase activity could be inferred. For example, in the case of the 55_547 178 \nphylogeny, PETase activity appears to be a promiscuous ancestral trait that existed prior to 179 \nthe discovery of extant PETases (such as LCC and Thermobifida cutinases), whereas the 180 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As both topologies failed rejection by the approximately unbiased (AU)41 test 183 \nand are statistically indifferent at representing the observed alignment data, it is not possible 184 \nto reject one of these hypotheses purely from a phylogenetic perspective. We also observe 185 \nno correlation between the mean posterior probability of an ancestor and its activity 186 \n(Supplementary Figure  5). This observation is somewhat counterintuitive, as the mean 187 \nposterior probability of a sequence, which is the statistical confidence in the identity of a 188 \nreconstructed ancestor, is often used to discriminate between poorly reconstructed sequences 189 \n(and hence likely to be less fit) and those that are likely to be functional and fit 40. Together, 190 \nthese results highlight the importance of sampling diverse phylogenetic backgrounds during 191 \nASR when accessing the functional sequence space of a protein family as minor phylogenetic 192 \nincongruencies can translate into significant functional differences in (equivalent) 193 \nreconstructed ancestral sequences. 194 \n 195 \nStructural characterization and analysis of ancestral cutinases. 196 \n 197 \nA comparative structural and sequence analysis of inactive and active ancestors suggests 198 \nthat PET hydrolysis appears to be a trait that is evolutionarily accessible from within the 199 \ncutinase background. Unlike the I. sakaiensis PETase, which emerged through conformational 200 \noptimization of the first - and second-shells via obvious selection within the active site 42\u201344, 201 \nPETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages appears to emerge through non -202 \nspecific and likely neutral mutations that are often distal to the active site ( Figure 2A-C). 203 \nIndeed, analysis of ancestral cutinase sequences reveals virtually no differences in the PET 204 \nbinding sites between PETase active and inactive variants ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). 205 \nFurthermore, mutations associated with a gain -of-function vary between the different 206 \nphylogenetic trees used to reconstruct the ancestral sequences. For example, ancestors 207 \n55_547 and 35_442 are each separated by 9 unique mutations from their closest relatives 208 \nwithout PETase activity (ancestors 10_543  with A15S, A36V, T49S, T92S, N109D, R114S, 209 \nN145R, I180V, S226A and 75_539 with A36V, T49D, T92S, M105Q, R114S, S124N, R167T, 210 \nP199S, A226S, respectively). Of these loss of function mutations, 3 are shared between either 211 \nbackground, 5 are unique and one is a reversion (S226A for 55_547, A226S for 35_442).   212 \nIntuitively, a combination (with at least one) of these mutations are required to be fixed in 213 \neither respective cutinase background to impart PETase activity. Similarly, ancestor 10_543 214 \nis separated by 8 mutations from its closest  relative with PETase activity (70_439 with E28Q, 215 \nS49D, S124N, R145N, V180I, P199S, S215T, A226S); of the 8 mutations associated with 216 \ngain-of-function in the background of 10_543, only 3 are specifically shared with gain -of-217 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Structural analysis revealed the formation 248 \nof domain-swapped dimers (Figure 2D). The observation of domain swapping, likely induced 249 \nby the high protein concentration in the crystallization conditions, suggests an intrinsic 250 \nflexibility of the C -terminus, a characteristic commonly observed in proteins previously 251 \ncharacterized to form domain-swapped dimers47. Given the flexible nature of the C-terminus, 252 \nit was hypothesized that introducing a disulfide bond to constrain this region into forming an 253 \nintramolecular \u03b2-sheet would enhance enzyme stability (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the chosen 254 \nsite for the disulfide bond coincided with the predicted Ca2+/Mg2+ binding site of the ancestors 255 \nbased on homology to extant cutinases, a region previously targeted for disulfide bond 256 \nengineering in TfCut2 and LCC for improved thermostability and PETase activity 6,48,49.

In combination with our comparative analysis of the selected 262 \ninactive and active ancestors, the successful optimization of PETase activity via the 263 \nintroduction of a disulfide bond distal to the active site illustrates that PETase activity within 264 \nthe cutinase family can emerge and be enhanced through mechanisms that extend beyond 265 \nthe structural reconfiguration of the active site. It is therefore likely that activity optimization is, 266 \nat least in part, being driven by thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization. 267 \n 268 \n  269 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This provided a high resolution 282 \nmutagenic map of the local sequence space around either of the ancestral PETase variants. 283 \nAmbiguously reconstructed sites were spatially distributed over the protein and not localized 284 \nto any specific functional area ( Supplementary Figure 7). Having already established that 285 \nthe mean posterior probability of an ancestral sequence is a poor indicator of PETase activity 286 \n(Supplementary Figure 4B) and that relatively minor changes in the cutinase sequence can 287 \ndrastically alter PETase activity, we hypothesized that the neighborhood of evolutionarily 288 \npossible (albeit less probable) sequences may contain mutations that benefit PETase activity. 289 \nThis hypothesis was guided by recent ASR studies on the I. sakaiensis PETase branch of the 290 \ncutinase phylogeny where PETase activity appeared to emerge transiently within ancestral 291 \nlineages50. Experimental characterization revealed that all of the alternate reconstructions of 292 \nancestors 55_547 and 35_442 demonstrated PETase activity that was comparable (or 293 \nreduced) to either respective ancestral background (Figure 3A-B).  294 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The 7 selected mutations, E1 4D, E28Q, A36V, S52A (in 55_547), F9 4L, 311 \nS196A, and H247S, were recombined in various combinations from 2 to 5 point mutations in 312 \nthe background of 35_442 and 55_547.

Specifically, 10 recombined variants in the 321 \nbackground of 55_547 showed increased PETase activity, with the most active being 322 \nE14D/E28Q/A36V (A 260 nm = 1.20 \u00b1 0.26), E2 8Q/S196A (A 260 nm = 1.08 \u00b1 0.05), and 323 \nE28Q/S52A/S196A (A260 nm = 1.03 \u00b1 0.09). Similarly, 14 recombinations in the background 324 \nof 35_442 demonstrated increased activity, with the most active being E28Q/S196A (A260 nm 325 \n= 1.42 \u00b1 0.29), E28Q/F94L (A260 nm = 0.99 \u00b1 0.17), and E14D/H247S (A260 nm = 0.77 \u00b1 0.08). 326 \nInterestingly, we identified 17 recombined variants that exhibited improved PETase activity 327 \nrelative to LCC ICCG, the most active extant variant in the study, with 35_442 E2 8Q/S196A, 328 \ndisplaying ~2.5-fold higher activity. 329 \n 330 \nThe mutational analysis of the recombined variants highlighted E2 8Q as a key mutation, 331 \npresent in 14 of the 17 variants that demonstrated enhanced activity compared to the 332 \nengineered LCC ICCG variant. This suggests a positive effect of E2 8Q on PETase activity; 333 \nhowever, this was only observed in the presence of other mutations from the recombinations. 334 \nThe context dependence of E2 8Q is especially significant when considering the double 335 \nmutation E28Q/S196A, which was among the most active in both ancestral backgrounds. 336 \nWhen assessed independently in the 55_547 background, the E2 8Q mutation adversely 337 \naffected activity (A260 nm = 0.00 \u00b1 0.00), and the S19 6A mutation similarly led to a reduction 338 \nin activity relative to the ancestor (A260 nm = 0.16 \u00b1 0.02). However, the combination of these 339 \nmutations resulted in a significant increase in activity beyond the additive effects of the single 340 \nmutations (A260 nm = 1.08 \u00b1 0.05), indicative of positive epistatic interactions. 341 \n 342 \nRuggedness analysis reveals epistasis in recombined mutations. 343 \n 344 \nWe next analyzed the topology of the PETase fitness landscape over the 196 cutinase 345 \nsequences characterized in this study. This was done both to build a holistic overview of 346 \nPETase evolution and function in the cutinase family and to assess the effectiveness of this 347 \napproach in exploring new -to-nature fitness peaks across functional sequence space. To 348 \nachieve this, we embedded cutinase sequences as nodes in a network graph where edges 349 \nconnect each node to its k nearest (Euclidean) neighbors. The scheme used to embed 350 \nsequences therefore dictates the topology of the network graph. When this is the one -hot 351 \nencoding (OHE), the Euclidean distance between nodes in the network graph is proportional 352 \nto the number of mutations between the sequences they represent. The OHE graph network 353 \ntherefore captures PETase activity as a function of the mutations between sequences when 354 \nthe signal over the graph is the measured PETase activity (Figure 5A).  355 \n 356 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In this space, ancestral and extant cutinases form homogenous, 366 \nrandom clusters (Figure 5A). The alternate reconstructions of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 367 \nand their recombinations are grouped as closely connected clusters around their respective 368 \nancestral backgrounds. Despite their comparable PETase activity, sequences in both 369 \nbackgrounds are resolved as independent components that share few direct edge 370 \nconnections, suggesting that the PETase fitness landscape is multi -modal (i.e. there are 371 \nmultiple solution spaces to competent PETase activity) when considering only naive, residue-372 \nwise OHE sequence embeddings.  373 \n 374 \nWe then reconstructed the PETase fitness landscape in a learned representation space. To 375 \nensure that local features of the cutinase sequence space were captured by a PLM, we used 376 \na recently described method of local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE)36. In brief, LASE 377 \ntrains a small and family-specific deep learning model on ancestrally reconstructed sequence 378 \ndatasets. The features learned by LASE capture the functional properties of proteins, such as 379 \ncatalytic efficiency, in a non -linear space that is not interpretable with simple mutational 380 \ndistances. Embedding in LASE can therefore reveal topological features of the fitness map 381 \nthat are obfuscated in an OHE embedding.  382 \n 383 \nSequences in the LASE embedding space cluster according to their relative fitness and how 384 \nthey were sampled (e.g. extant, ancestral, alternate or recombined; Figure 5B). For example, 385 \nall point mutations from alternate reconstructions and recombinations group together in a 386 \nsingle connected component in the LASE space, irrespective of the genetic background 387 \n(ancestors 55_547 or 35_442) they were introduced into. Moreso, ancestral and extant 388 \nsequences cluster into disconnected components, despite their often high degree of site-wise 389 \nsequence similarity. Indeed, the LASE representation space is highly structured relative to the 390 \nOHE space, where ancestral and extant sequences co-occur across distinct identity groups in 391 \nthe network graph. This indicates that our sequence sampling strategy is highly structured and 392 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We define ruggedness as the non -linearity between the fitness of a 397 \nsequence and its neighbors in the network graph. We use the Dirichlet energy of the graph, 398 \nwhich describes the non-linearity of a signal over a graph, to measure this 36,51,52. In order to 399 \nmake the Dirichlet energy interpretable as a node-wise local quantity, we calculate it over each 400 \nsubgraph in the network defined by an edge-length of exactly 1, thus reducing its interpretation 401 \nto the deviation from linearity a node demonstrates relative only to its immediate neighbors; 402 \nthe fitness signal over the network graph changes as a linear function (i.e. is smooth) over 403 \nnodes of the graph that are characterized by low local DEs. The local Dirichlet energy is 404 \ntherefore a descriptor of how confounded by epistasis a sequence is. This analysis revealed 405 \nthat the fitness landscape is most rugged over the cutinase variants with the greatest PETase 406 \nactivity. Indeed, the node with the single highest local Dirichlet energy is also the fitness peak 407 \n(ancestor 55_547_E28Q/S196A). Importantly, this was true for both OHE and LASE network 408 \ngraphs (Figure 5C; Supplementary Figure 9 ), indicating that the combinatorial mutations 409 \nE28Q/S196A in the 55_547 background would be unlikely to be introduced through a stepwise 410 \nmutagenesis approach due to the relatively low activity of each single mutation in isolation. 411 \nTogether, these analyses demonstrate that mASR can effectively guide protein engineering 412 \nby discovering evolutionary features that are not immediately apparent, and can help navigate 413 \nrugged regions of sequence space to find fit enzyme variants that are not rationally obvious. 414 \n 415 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This method allowed us 427 \nto reconstruct and analyze ancestral cutinases across 20 diverse phylogenetic topologies, 428 \nmoving beyond the constraints of a single -tree perspective. Our experimental 429 \ncharacterizations of 20 extant and 48 ancestral cutinases unveiled a wide spectrum of 430 \nactivities against amorphous PET film (A260 nm = 0.00 - 0.59). Of particular interest were two 431 \nancestors, 35_442 (A 260 nm = 0.37 \u00b1 0.06) and 55_547 (A 260 nm = 0.59 \u00b1 0.09), each 432 \nrepresenting the most recent common ancestor of LCC 13 and TfCut25 on independent trees 433 \nand exhibiting similar activity to the most active extant cutinases, LCC (A 260 nm = A260 nm = 434 \n0.34 \u00b1 0.03) and BhrPETase (A260 nm = 0.49 \u00b1 0.01). Notably, the use of mASR was crucial 435 \nin uncovering the variability of ancestrally reconstructed sequences, as it revealed that 436 \nequivalent nodes from independent phylogenetic topologies exhibited highly varied activity 437 \ndespite all topologies being equally valid representations of the underlying sequence 438 \nalignment based on the AU -test. While some ancestors were inactive, others showed 439 \nsignificant PETase activity comparable to characterized extant PETases. These observations 440 \nhighlight the utility of the mASR method in improving both the success and robustness of ASR 441 \napplications in protein engineering.

Multiplexed ASR may therefore become an important 444 \ncomponent of ASR- and evolutionary-guided enzyme design strategies in the future.  445 \n  446 \nOur sequence and structural analysis of active and inactive ancestral cutinases provided 447 \ninsights on the evolutionary emergence of PETase activity in the cutinase family. In particular, 448 \nour findings suggest that PETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages has 449 \nemerged through neutral mutations that are distal to the active site, rather than specific 450 \nchanges localized to the active site itself, as observed in the evolution of I. sakaiensis 451 \nPETase37. Our detailed examination of ancestors 35_442 and 55_547, along with their closest 452 \ninactive counterparts, highlighted unique gain-of-function mutations leading to PETase activity 453 \nfrom these distinct phylogenetic backgrounds. These findings imply the existence of multiple, 454 \ndistinct evolutionary pathways for acquiring PETase functionality and indicate that PETase 455 \nactivity is readily accessible within the cutinase family.  456 \n 457 \nOur structural analysis also revealed the formation of domain -swapped dimers between 458 \nadjacent symmetry mates in the crystal structures of the ancestral variants 35_442 and 459 \n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

While possibly an artifact of the crystallization conditions, this observation suggests 460 \na certain degree of structural flexibility in the C-terminus of these ancestors even in solution. 461 \nBased on this observation, we introduced a disulfide bond in the C -terminus of ancestor 462 \n55_547 that coincided with the predicted Ca 2+/Mg2+ binding site, a strategy homologous to 463 \nsimilar successful modifications in TfCut2 and LCC that were observed to improve stability 464 \nand activity6,48,49. Indeed, the introduction of the disulfide N20 6C/S253C resulted in a variant 465 \nof 55_547 with an approximately 2 -fold improvement in whole -cell activity and 1.5 -fold 466 \nimprovement in soluble expression relative to the background ancestor. 467 \n 468 \nWe deepened our exploration of the evolutionary sequence space of the cutinase family by 469 \naddressing ambiguously reconstructed positions in the initial mASR. Ambiguous positions 470 \nwere identified based on a posterior probability threshold of \u2265 0.2 for the second most probable 471 \nresidue. Introducing these 69 alternate reconstructions as single mutations into 35_442 and 472 \n55_547, we observed that most mutations were either neutral or decreased PETase activity 473 \nrelative to the ancestral background. However, when we recombined a random subset of the 474 \nalternate reconstructions, we observed several recombinations in the background of both 475 \n35_442 (E2 8Q/S196A) and 55_547 (E1 4D/E28Q/A36V) that displayed increased PETase 476 \nactivity, not only relative to the initial ancestors, but also to an engineered variant of LCC with 477 \nenhanced activity, LCC ICCG 6. Notably, the most active recombinations exhibited activity 478 \nimprovements that exceeded the additive effects predicted from their individual mutations, 479 \nhighlighting positive epistatic interactions that contribute to their PETase activity. 480 \n 481"
