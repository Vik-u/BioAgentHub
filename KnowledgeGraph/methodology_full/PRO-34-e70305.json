      "text": "4.1 | Metagenomic mining for putative\nPETase candidates in marine bacterial\nmetagenomes\nTo identify novel PETases with higher sequence and\nstructure diversity to known ones in the PAZy data-\nbase, a profile hidden-Markov model was prepared.\nShortly, the profile was generated with biochemically\ncharacterized PETases, as reported previously\n(Buchholz et al.,\n2022), and a search was performed\nagainst marine metagenomes from the Tara Oceans\n(Sunagawa et al., 2015) and other publicly available\nmetagenomes (accession numbers PRJNA454581 and\nPRJNA901861) with HMMER3 (Eddy, 1998). Hit-\nsequences with a bit score higher than 100 were\nselected for further filtering. The filtering was implemen-\nted by excluding duplicates and highly similar\nsequences as well as sequences that did not include a\ncanonical catalytic triad with Ser-His-Asp. Additionally,\nhits with more diverse bacterial origins in comparison to\nexisting affiliations were chosen. Finally, 20 target pro-\nteins were selected for further analysis.\n4.2 | Molecular cloning and target\nprotein production inE. coliMC1061\nThe corresponding target genes were truncated if\nN-terminal signal sequences were present. These\nsequences were identified by SignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,\n2022). Molecular cloning was performed with the\nfragment-exchange (FX)-cloning methodology, whereby\nthe truncated target genes were extended with recogni-\ntion sites for the restriction enzymeSapI using the FX-\ncloning tool (\nhttps://www.fxcloning.org/) (Geertsma &\nDutzler, 2011). This cloning methodology leads to a sin-\ngle amino acid overhang on each end (N-terminal serine\nand C-terminal alanine) of the final gene product. Finally,\nall target genes were codon-optimized for heterologous\nexpression in E. coli MC1061. The target genes were\ncloned into the plasmid vectors p1 (Geertsma & Dutzler,\n2011), p2, p3, or p12 (Bjerga et al.,2016), leading to the\nattachment of an N-10xHis-, N-10xHis-Maltose-binding-\nprotein (MBP)-, N-10xHis-Small Ubiquitin-related MOdi-\nfier (SUMO)- or C-6xHis-tag, respectively, to the final\nprotein. The positive control, LCC\nICCG, was cloned into\np12, and the negative control, namely a linker sequence\nof GSGSGS, was cloned into each vector. Successful\ncloning was tested by colony PCR and subsequent aga-\nrose gel electrophoresis. Finally, genes were verified by\nsequencing if the corresponding target protein showed\nhydrolytic activity towards PET. Sequencing was also\nperformed for every negative and the positive control.\nFor heterologous gene expression in E. coli\nMC1061, chemically competent bacteria were trans-\nformed with the plasmid constructs. A pre-culture with\n3 mL LB and 100\u03bcg/mL ampicillin was prepared by\ninoculation and subsequent incubation at 37\n/C14 C, over-\nnight and 180 rpm. Next, 20 mL 2YT medium with\n100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask\n(main culture) was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the pre-\nculture and incubated at 140 rpm, 37\n/C14 C for 2 to 3 h until\nan OD600 /C24 0.6. Then, the main cultures were trans-\nferred to 18/C14 C and gene expression was induced by\nadding 100 \u03bcL of a 20% (w/v) L-arabinose stock-\nsolution for a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). After\n20 h, cultures were placed on ice, decanted into pre-\ncooled 50 mL tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 4\n/C14 C\nand 3000/C2 g. Next, cell pellets were resuspended in\n10 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 mM\nimidazole. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and\nthe lysates centrifuged for 30 min at 4\n/C14 C and 3000/C2 g.\nThe cleared cell lysate was used for further purification.\n4.3 | Target protein purification by Ni-\nimmobilized metal affinity chromatography\n(Ni-IMAC)\nThe soluble fractions of the poly-His-tagged target pro-\nteins were subjected to a Ni-NTA column purification\nusing a HisPur\u2122 Ni-NTA Spin Purification Kit (0.2 mL,\nThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s proto-\ncol. Finally, three 200 \u03bcL elution fractions were col-\nlected and stored at 4/C14 C for a maximum of 2 days.\n4.4 | Functional screening on substrate\nsupplemented agar plates\nThe production of agar plates supplemented with\nrespective substrates was adapted from P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda\n10 of 15 TURAK ET AL.\n\net al. (2021). PBS agar was prepared with 0.1 M PBS\nand 1.5% (w/v) agar, sterilized by autoclaving, and\nallowed to cool down to ca. 60/C14 C until substrate solu-\ntions were added. 20 mL of substrate PBS agar was\ndispensed into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify\nunder sterile conditions.\n4.5 | Production of PET nanoparticle\n(PET-NP) suspension and agar-plates\nA stock PET-NP suspension was prepared by dissol-\nving 0.1 g thin pieces of a PET film (Goodfellow) in\n10 mL 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaf luoro-2-propanol (HFIP,\nSigma-Aldrich) in a separatory funnel in the fume\nhood. The solution was dropped slowly into 100 mL\npre-cooled and deionized water in a glass beaker\nunder vigorous mixing with an Ultra-Turrax \u2122 T25\nbasic (IKA Labortechnik). Residual HFIP was allowed\nto evaporate for several days. The suspension\n(ca. 0.3 mg/mL) was added to 200 mL molten PBS-\nagar. In all PET-NP suspension preparations, precipi-\ntation of PET was observed, which potentially\ndecreased the final concentration of PET-NPs after\nfiltration in the agar plates. Agar plates with sufficient\nturbidity after visual inspection were used for further\nexperiments.\n4.6 | Production of BHET solution and\nagar-plates\nA 1 M stock solution of Bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n(BHET, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in DMSO. BHET-\ncontaining PBS-agar plates were prepared with a final\nconcentration of 0.5 M BHET.\n4.7 | Production of PCL solution and\nagar-plates\n0.25 g of PCL granules (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved\nin 15 mL acetone at 60/C14 C. This solution was transferred\ninto 500 mL of PBS-agar.\n4.8 | Functional screening of target\nproteins\nTwenty microliters of Ni-NTA purified target protein was\nspotted onto PCL, BHET, or PET-NP supplemented\nPBS-agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30\n/C14 C\nfor 7 days. Enzymatic hydrolysis activity was detected\nby the formation of zones of clearance (halos), which\nbecame visible due to the decrease of turbidity on the\nplate.\n4.9 | Heterologous expression and\npurification ofHaloPETase1 and single\nmutants thereof\nThe codon-optimized gene sequence (without\nN-terminal signal peptide) ofHaloPETase1 (GenBank\nID: MAB42154.1) was cloned into the p3 vector, which\nleads to a protein with N-10xHis-SUMO-tag upon\nexpression. Chemically competent E. coli Shuffle\u00ae T7\n(NEB) were transformed with the respective construct\nand cultivated on LB-agar plates with 100\u03bcg/mL ampi-\ncillin. A pre-culture was prepared in LB with 100\u03bcg/mL\nampicillin by cultivation overnight at 37/C14 C and 180 rpm.\nA 2 L culture with TB medium and 100\u03bcg/mL ampicillin\nin a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with 1% (v/v)\nof the pre-culture and grown until an OD\n600 of /C24 0.6 at\n37/C14 C and 140 rpm. The culture was placed at 18/C14 C and\ngene expression induced by adding 0.2% (v/v) from a\n20% (w/v) L-Arabinose stock. Bacteria were harvested\nafter 20 h by centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed\nin 20 mL PBS and subsequently frozen at/C0 20\n/C14 C until\nfurther use.\nFor purification, the cell pellets were thawed on ice\nand resuspended in 40 mL of cold buffer A (50 mM\nNaP\ni, 50 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells\nwere lysed by sonication, and the supernatant collected\nafter centrifugation was subjected to a Ni-IMAC with a\n5 mL HisTrap\n\u00ae FF column (Cytiva) attached to an\n\u00c4KTA pure\u2122 (Cytiva) purification system. Elution was\nperformed by an imidazole gradient with buffer B\n(50 mM NaPi, 500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl,\npH 7.4) ranging from 0 to 50% over 20 CV.\nTo cleave the N-10xHis-SUMO-tag from the target\nprotein, 2 mg of SUMO-tag protease SenP2 was added\nto approx. 40 mg protein (1:20 mass ratio) in the pooled\nNi-IMAC fractions. The protein was dialyzed overnight\nat 4\n/C14 C against buffer C (20 mM NaPi, 150 mM NaCl,\npH 7.4) to remove imidazole and then further purified\nby reverse Ni-IMAC. Finally, the target protein was fur-\nther purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)\nusing a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 75 pg. column\nattached to an \u00c4KTA pure\u2122 (Cytiva) purification sys-\ntem. SEC fractions were pooled, and the protein was\nconcentrated to 10 to 50 mg/mL. 25 to 50\u03bcL samples\nwere flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at/C0 20\n/C14 C\nuntil further use.\n4.10 | PET-degradation endpoint and\nkinetic measurements in PET-coated well\nplates and soluble product analysis\n96-well plates (Thermo Scientific\u2122 Nunc MicroWell\u2122\nflat bottom) were coated with a PET-film according to\nWeigert et al. (\n2021)5 0\u03bcL of an enzyme solution was\nadded per well, and the plates were sealed with a gas-\nTURAK ET AL. 11 of 15\n\ntight self-adhesive film. In general, plates with enzyme\nsolutions were incubated at the target temperature for\n20 h. Subsequently, all samples were prepared and\nanalyzed via reverse-phase UHPLC as described in\nWeigert et al. (\n2021).\nKinetic analysis was performed with 70\u03bcL enzyme\nsolution per well. To analyze the total product releases\nat specific time points, 50\u03bcL solution was transferred to\na non-coated 96-well plate. This plate was then trans-\nferred to/C0 20\n/C14 C to quench the reaction. Reverse-phase\nUHPLC analysis was performed as before.\n4.11 | pNPB-activity measurement for\nthermostability assessment of\nHaloPETase1\n500 nM of HaloPETase1 were incubated in 1 mL\n20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, with 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl concentra-\ntion at 50, 60, or 68/C14 C for up to 72 h. 10\u03bcL samples\nwere taken after 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h from each salt\nand temperature condition and diluted with 980 \u03bcL\n20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl in a UV-\ntransmissible plastic cuvette. To begin the hydrolytic\nreaction, 10 \u03bcL of a 100 mM pNPB in DMSO were\ntransferred to the enzyme solution in the cuvette. The\nreaction was mixed by inversion, and kinetic absor-\nbance measurement was performed at 405 nm immedi-\nately after mixing. The residual activity was determined\nby normalizing the initial rates with the one at 0 h\nincubation.\n4.12 | Heterologous expression and\npurification ofHaloPETases2 to 6\nThe genes ofHaloPETases2 to 6 were analyzed with\nSignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,2022) to identify and remove\nthe N-terminal signal peptide. Genes were codon-\noptimized for production in E. coli Shuffle\n\u00ae T7 cells\n(NEB) and cloned into the pET21b-vector. Pre-cultures\nwere prepared as before. The expression was then\ninduced by the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG (final concen-\ntration) and cultures were left overnight at 16 or 20\n/C14 C\nwith 140 rpm shaking. Cells were harvested, and pel-\nlets were washed with 30 mL PBS.\nCells were thawed on ice, resuspended with 30 mL of\nbuffer A, and subsequently lysed via ultrasonication.\nCrude cell lysates were centrifuged to separate cell debris\nfrom soluble protein at 4\n/C14 C, 18,000 rpm for 1 h. The\ncleared lysates (supernatants) were transferred into a\nfresh vessel and stored on ice. Ni-NTA and SEC purifica-\ntion steps were performed for all proteins. If insufficient\npurity was observed by SDS-PAGE, ion-exchange chro-\nmatography was performed as a final step.\nIf so, fractions from the SEC were pooled and concen-\ntrated to dilute the NaCl concentration 20-fold from 150 to\ntheoretically 7.5 mM with buffer D (20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4).\nCation- and anion-exchange chromatography was per-\nformed with a 1 mL HiTrap\n\u00ae SP FF or 1 mL HiTrap\u00ae Q\nFF column, respectively. The elution was performed by a\nlinear gradient from 0 to 25% of buffer E (20 mM NaPi,\n2 M NaCl, pH 7.4) over 20 CV. The peak fractions were\npooled, concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen.\n4.13 | Site-directed mutagenesis of\nHaloPETase1\nSingle mutations were introduced inHaloPETase1 at\nposition T88 to re-establish the\u03c0-stacking clamp and at\nposition Q157 to re-introduce the canonical methionine\nin the lipase-box motif using site-directed mutagenesis.\nSee Table\nS5 for primer pairs and sequences.\nSequences were verified by Sanger sequencing.\n4.14 | Bioinformatic mining for putative\nPETases inHalopseudomonas\nA search was conducted against the proteome ofHalop-\nseudomonas. For this, 40 genomes were retrieved from\nNCBI (for accession numbers see Table S4). Open\nreading frames of theHalopseudomonas genomes were\npredicted with Prodigal version 2.6.3 (Hyatt et al.,2010).\nA hidden Markov model profile from biochemically char-\nacterized PETases from the PAZy database (Buchholz\net al.,\n2022) was generated with HMMER version 3.1b1\n(Eddy, 1998) using thehmmbuild option, and a search\nagainst theHalopseudomonas proteome was performed\nusing HMMER 3.1b1 with thehmmsearch option and a\nbitscore threshold of 100.\n4.15 | Three-dimensional structure\ndetermination\nHaloPETase1 in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5\nwas set to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Sitting-\ndrop vapor-diffusion methodology was used with JCSG\nCore I-III and PEGs II (Qiagen) for screening crystalli-\nzation conditions in 96 well Intelli plates (Art Robbins)\nstored at 20\n/C14 C in Rock Imager RI 182 (Formulatrix).\nVolume ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 were prepared using\na Phoenix robot dispenser (Art Robbins Instruments)\nwith a total drop volume of 0.8\u03bcL. Crystal formation\nwas observed in the following condition: 1:1 ratio, 0.1 M\nimidazole, 40% (v/v) PEG 400. For cryoprotection, 25%\n(v/v) glycerol was added to the crystals before flash-\nfreezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were col-\nlected at the German Electron Synchroton (DESY)\nbeamline P13 (Cianci et al.,\n2017) operated by the\nHelmholtz association using a wavelength of 0.97 \u00c5\nand a PILATUS detector.\n12 of 15 TURAK ET AL.\n\nDiffraction data were processed with X-ray Detector\nSoftware (XDS) using XDSAPP 3.1.5 (Krug et al.,\n2012). The structure was solved by molecular replace-\nment with PHASER in the PHENIX (Adams et al.,\n2010) software suite v.1.21 using a ColabFold (Mirdita\net al., 2022) model of HaloPETase1. The refinement\nwas performed with phenix.refine. The model was\nimproved by electron density map inspection and itera-\ntive manual rebuilding performed in Coot v.0.9 (Emsley\net al.,\n2010). The 3D-structure and structure factors\nwere deposited in the PDB (Berman,2000) with acces-\nsion code 9hl5. All structural representations and\ngraphical manipulations were performed in PyMOL\n3.0.0 (Schrodinger, LLC) (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC,2024).\n4.16 | Sequence and structure analysis\nof HaloPETases\nMultiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were performed\nusing ProbCons (Do et al., 2005) with full-length\nsequences. Alignment of Pseudomonas mendocina\ncutinase ( PmC) was performed with the protein\nsequence retrieved from UniProtKB (The UniProt\nConsortium,\n2023) (entry: A4Y035). Sequence homol-\nogy analysis ofHaloPETases and reference PETases\nsuch as leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC, Uni-\nProtKB entry: G9BY57) and Ideonella sakaiensis\nPETase (IsPETase, UniProtKB entry: A0K8P6T7) was\nperformed by creating a MSA with ProbCons and using\nthe ClustalX 2.1 (Larkin et al.,\n2007) software suite to\ngenerate a neighborhood-join tree with 1000 bootstrap.\nThe tree was illustrated using the website tool Interac-\ntive Tree of Life (iTOL,\nhttps://itol.embl.de/). To plot the\namino-acid frequencies from the MSA as a logo plot,\nthe python library LogoMaker was employed (https://\ngithub.com/jbkinney/logomaker)."

      "text": "acterized HaloPETases were modeled with ColabFold\n(Mirdita et al.,2022); only rank 1 structures were consid-\nered for further analyses. Structural alignments were gen-\nerated in PyMOL with the sequence-independentalign\nalgorithm (default settings; 2 \u00c5 cut-off and 5 refinement\ncycles) implemented in the software. In all cases, the\nalignment was done globally and with all backbone C\u03b1\natoms, except the first 40 C\u03b1 to exclude the N-terminal\nsignal peptides.\n4.17 | Preparation of PET-films\nPolymer films were prepared using a 25-12-2HC hot\npress (Carver) with a 130/C2 130 /C2 0.1 mm mold. The\nrequired amount of polymer (fiber grade PET granules\nRT3050, Indorma Ventures) was placed in the mold,\nwhich was then sandwiched between stainless-steel\nplates coated with Nowoflon Perfluoralkoxy (PFA) foil.\nThe material was heated to 270\n/C14 C for 3 min and\npressed at 5 tons for 1 min. Afterwards, the PET films,\nalong with the mold, were rapidly quenched in ice water\nimmediately after removal from the hot press. The crys-\ntallinity of the films was determined using DSC.\n4.18 | Differential scanning calorimetry\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements\nwere conducted using a Netzsch 204 F1 Phoenix\ninstrument. Approximately 5\u20137 mg of the sample was\nplaced in an aluminum crucible with a pierced lid. The\nanalysis was performed over a temperature range of\n0 to 300\n/C14 C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Flow: 20 mL/\nmin). Data analysis was carried out using the Proteus\nAnalysis 8.0 software.\nThe percentage crystallinity of the polymer was\ndetermined using DSC by calculating the ratio of the\nenthalpy of fusion of the polymer sample subtracted by\nthe enthalpy of crystallization to the enthalpy of fusion\nof the polymer at 100% crystallinity, as shown in the fol-\nlowing equation:\n%Crystallinity \u00bc\u00f0 \u00f0\u0394H\nf ;sample /C0 \u0394Hc;sample\u00de=\u0394Hf ;100%\u00de\n/C2 100\nwhere \u0394Hf ,sample is the enthalpy of fusion of the sample,\n\u0394Hc,sample is the enthalpy of crystallization obtained\nfrom the 1st heating curve of the DSC plot.\u0394Hf ,100%\nrepresents the enthalpy of fusion of the fully crystalline\npolymer. The \u0394Hf ,100% was taken as 140 J/g (Zhu,\n2002). Using the above equation the crystallinity of the\nPET films was calculated to be/C24 14%.\n4.19 | Scanning electron microscopy\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed\non an FEI Quanta FEG 250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific),\nequipped with an ET detector. To prepare the samples\nfor imaging, a 2.0 nm platinum coating was applied\nusing a Cressington 208HR Platinum Sputter Coater,\nwith the coating thickness monitored by an MTM20\nthickness monitor.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nOnur Turak:Conceptualization; investigation; writing\u2013\noriginal draft; writing \u2013 review and editing; formal\nanalysis.

      "text": "2.1 | Screening for novel PETases\nTo identify PETases from the marine environment, a\nprofile hidden Markov-Model (pHMM) search was\napplied to marine bacterial metagenomes, published by\nthe Tara Oceans project (Sunagawa et al., 2015).\nTwenty target proteins that showed a bit-score higher\nthan 100 were selected to analyze their ability for PET\ndegradation. These proteins were recombinantly pro-\nduced in E. coli. Subsequently, purified proteins were\nspotted onto PBS-agar plates supplemented with either\nBHET, PET-NP, or PCL to characterize their enzymatic\nactivity towards these substrates.\nWe observed the formation of zones of clearances\n(halos) for 14 target proteins towards all substrates\n(Figure\nS1 and TableS1). Three hits, PSW62-1,Halo-\nPETase1, and ASW29-1, indicated halos on PET-\nplates after 7 days of incubation at 30/C14 C. We ana-\nlyzed their affiliation and identified the origin of their\ngene sequences in metagenomes associated with\nPseudomonas sp. According to a BLASTp search in\nnon-redundant protein databases, PSW62-1 and\nASW29-1 have a sequence identity of 89.2% with the\nPET-active polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from Halop-\nseudomonas aestusnigri (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, &\nJaeger, 2020). In the case of HaloPETase1, a cuti-\nnase from Pseudomonas mendocina (PmC) was the\nclosest related and characterized PETase (Ronkvist\net al., 2009) until later on, Chen et al. (2024) pub-\nlished dsPETase05, a salt-tolerant PETase from the\nNorth Su hydrothermal vent (Chen et al.,\n2024)t h a t\nshares over 98% sequence identity with HaloPE-\nTase1. Due to sequence identities of 62.4% withPmC\nand sequence identities of <34% to PETases from\ntype I and II (see TableS2), we concluded thatHalo-\nPETase1 is a promising candidate for the extension\nof the narrow sequence space of currently known\nPETases.\n2.2 | Quantification and optimization of\nPET-degradation byHaloPETase1\nHaloPETase1 was produced and tested in the func-\ntional agar screening with an N-10xHis-SUMO-tag. For\nsubsequent experiments, the tag was removed from\nthe enzyme during purification (see also Figure\nS2 for\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel). We investigated the PET\ndegradation (Figure1) conditions byHaloPETase1 first\nusing PET-coated well-plates (Weigert et al.,2021) and\nthen using in solution immersed PET films to assess\nthe potential of this enzyme.\nHaloPETase1 was found in marine metagenomes\nand includes an N-terminal signal peptide indicating\nthat the protein is likely secreted into the saline marine\nenvironment. Therefore, we tested degradation of PET\nusing a NaCl gradient ranging from 0.25 to 2 M at\n40, 50, and 60\n/C14 C (Figure1a). The highest total product\nrelease at 40/C14 C after 20 h was observed in the enzyme\nsolution with 1 M NaCl (Figure 1b), whereby higher\nNaCl concentrations led to a decreased product\nrelease. Since the total product release increased con-\ntinuously from 0.25 to 2 M NaCl at 50\n/C14 C, we assumed\nthat NaCl concentrations higher than 2 M would lead to\neven higher total product releases. Consequently, we\nalso tested PET degradation at 50, 60, and 68\n/C14 C with\nup to 5 M NaCl. Notably, the optimal NaCl concentra-\ntions increased with higher reaction temperatures\n(Figure\n1b). We observed the highest total product\nrelease at 50/C14 C with 3 M NaCl. At 60/C14 C, it decreased in\ncomparison to the PET degradation at 50/C14 C, but the\nNaCl optimum increased to 4 M. Similarly, at 68/C14 C\nthe total product release was even lower than at 60/C14 C,\nbut the NaCl optimum increased even up to 5 M.\nTo test the effect of NaCl on the enzymatic thermo-\nstability, we incubated HaloPETase1 up to 3 days at\n50, 60, and 68/C14 C with either 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl. Subse-\nquently, the residual activity was measured by apara-\nnitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) assay (Figure S3). The\nresidual activity after 72 h at 50/C14 C with 5 M NaCl appar-\nently did not decrease. However, we observed a reduc-\ntion of the residual activity to 49% and 74% with 1 and\n3 M NaCl after 72 h, respectively. At 60\n/C14 C, the residual\nactivity dropped to 0.6% with 1 M NaCl after 4 days,\nwhile with NaCl concentrations of 3 and 5 M it\ndecreased to 2.7% and 15.3%, respectively, after 72 h\nat the same temperature. Finally, at 68\n/C14 C, no more\nresidual activity could be observed for all NaCl concen-\ntrations after 1 h. Taken together, these results indicate\na stabilizing effect of high NaCl concentrations on\nHaloPETase1 at higher temperatures.\nNext, we investigated the pH dependent degrada-\ntion in the PET-coated well-plate setup with 100 nM\nHaloPETase1. We observed that the highest total prod-\nuct release at 50\n/C14 C with 3 M NaCl occurs at pH values\nbetween 9.5 and 10, as indicated by the sum of TPA,\nTURAK ET AL. 3o f1 5\n\nMHET and BHET concentrations (Figure1c). The deg-\nradation of PET with sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8\nmainly led to the formation of MHET. However, the deg-\nradation of PET with CAPS buffer at pH 10.5 mainly led\nto the formation of TPA. Both conditions, nevertheless,\nindicated similar total product releases.\nAfter identifying the apparent optimal enzyme concen-\ntration within this experimental framework (Figure\n1d), we\nperformed buffer and pH-dependent PET-degradation\nexperiments with 500 nMHaloPETase1. The release of\nacidic products, such as MHET or TPA, during enzymatic\nhydrolysis of PET can reduce the pH if not sufficiently\nFIGURE 1 Reaction conditions for PET-degradation byHaloPETase1.

All PET hydrolysis experiments were performed with 3 technical replicas, error bars indicate standard deviations.\n4o f1 5 TURAK ET AL.\n\nbuffered. This can affect the enzymatic rates due to\neffects on protein stability and activity. Further, the choice\nof buffer can have a concentration-dependent effect on\nenzyme rates of PETases as well (Schmidt et al.,\n2016).\nThus, we increased the buffer concentrations to 0.1 M to\ngain a higher total product release. When degradation\nwas tested at pH 7.5 with sodium phosphate or pH 9.5\nwith carbonate or borate buffer, total product releases\nincreased, yielding between 5 and 6 mM (Figure\n1e). In\nthe case of 0.1 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.5, <2 mM total\nproduct release was observed, indicating an inhibiting\neffect of this buffer.\nFurther, we analyzed PET-degradation byHaloPE-\nTase1 using medium crystallinity PET-films ( /C24 15%\ncrystallinity [see also Figure S11], 150\u2013200 \u03bcm thick-\nness, 1 cm/C2 1 cm, /C24 40 mg) in a weight-loss experi-\nment (Figure1f). Here, PET films were immersed in an\nenzyme solution for 7 days at 50/C14 C, and the weight loss\nof the films was subsequently measured. Due to differ-\nences in the PET-coated well plate and PET-film\nassays, the optimal enzyme concentration had to be re-\nevaluated. The highest weight loss ( /C24 25%) was\nobserved with 0.5\u03bcM HaloPETase1. An increase in the\nenzyme concentration to 1 and 2 \u03bcM showed lower\nweight losses of about 20% and 17%, respectively.\nCorrespondingly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nmicrographs were acquired to analyze changes in the\nsurface topography of the PET films after immersion in\nthe enzyme solution (Figure\n1g). In comparison to the\nnegative control (only buffer treated PET film), the sur-\nface of the 0.5\u03bcM HaloPETase1 treated film showed\nthe formation of pit-hole-like topographies with diame-\nters ranging from 10 to 20\u03bcm. Similar topography has\nbeen observed previously for the thermostable PETase\nPHL7, where larger pits were seen on PET-disks with a\nsimilar crystallinity (15.8%) upon treatment (Thomsen\net al.,\n2023). Notably, crystal-like formation on the trea-\nted film surfaces may indicate NaCl crystals due to\nbuffer conditions.\nTo compare the PETase-activity ofHaloPETase1 to\nthe benchmark PETase LCC-iccg (an activity and ther-\nmostability improved variant) (Tournier et al.,2020), we\nperformed a hydrolysis time course measurement in a\nPET-coated well plate. Apparently, HaloPETase1 is\ninactive at 50/C14 C in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl. How-\never, increasing the NaCl concentration up to 3 M leads\nto a total product release of about 1 mM after 7.5 h. In\ncontrast, the improved LCC-iccg performs similarly at\nlow and high NaCl concentrations, in both cases reach-\ning a total product release of about 2.5 mM after 7.5 h."

      "text": "HaloPETase1 degrades PET in both the PET-coated\nwell-plate assay and the solution immersed PET-film\nassay. HaloPETase1 is a salt-tolerant enzyme and\ndepends on higher salt concentrations for the degrada-\ntion of PET at elevated temperatures. These results\nalign well with observations made for dsPETase05\n(Chen et al.,\n2024).\n2.3 | Structure and sequence\nclassification ofHaloPETase1\nBacterial PETases can be classified as type I, type IIa,\nand type IIb based on their structural and sequence\nfeatures near their active sites (Joo et al.,\n2018; Richter\net al.,2023), such as the presence of an extended loop\nsurrounding the active site, the number and position of\ndisulfide bonds, and the amino acid composition at sub-\nsites I and II. Type I PETases have no extended loop\nregions and show one disulfide bond. In contrast, type\nII PETases have extended loop regions and two disul-\nfide bonds; they are further subdivided into type IIa and\nIIb based on differences in the extended loop regions.\nTo better classify HaloPETase1, we elucidated its\nX-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 1.16 \u00c5 (PDB\ncode:\n9hl5, Table S3) and compared it to existing\nPETases (Figure 2). HaloPETase1 has the canonical\n\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold illustrating highly conserved spatial\npositions for its catalytic residues S156, D206, and\nH236 as known forIsPETase (type IIb). There are two\ndisulfide bonds observed: Db I (C64-C126) and Db II\n(C273-C276) (Figure\n2a). While two bonds are charac-\nteristic for type II PETases, these are, however, located\nat different positions in HaloPETase1. Notably, we\ncould not observe a disulfide bond flanking the active\nsite, as it is known forIsPETase (Joo et al.,\n2018).\nPrevious structure analyses on the binding mode of\nPET substrate modules to PETases suggested an aro-\nmatic interaction between the benzene moiety of the\nsubstrate with two opposing aromatic amino acids at\nthe active site. For example, PHL7 (type I) indicated a\ndistorted T-shaped \u03c0\u2013\u03c0-interaction of F63 and W156\nwith the benzene moiety of TPA in a co-crystal struc-\nture (Richter et al.,\n2023). Similarly,IsPETase showed,\ndepending on the study, up to two\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions by\nY87 and W185 (docking of tetrameric PET module and\nmutational analysis) (Joo et al., 2018) or W185\n(QM/MM analysis or complex crystal structure with\nHEMT) (Burgin et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2021). Alto-\ngether, type I and II PETases consist of two opposing\naromatic amino acids such as Y/F and W at equivalent\npositions to F63 and W156 in PHL7, and Y87 and\nW185 inIsPETase.\nIn HaloPETase1, on the other hand, we observed\nthe non-conserved aromatic acid Y180 in subsite I\n(equivalent to W185 inIsPETase, Figure\n2b,c), which\nmight form a\u03c0-stacking interaction with the substrate.\nHowever, instead of an aromatic residue at the equiva-\nlent position of Y87 in IsPETase, we found T88 for\nHaloPETase1. Thus, the so-called\u03c0-stacking \u201cclamp\u201d\ndoes not exist for HaloPETase1. Further, we\nTURAK ET AL. 5o f1 5\n\nhypothesize that the backbone amide protons of T88\nand Q157 are responsible for the formation of the oxy-\nanion hole in HaloPETase1 since these residues are\nlocated at equivalent positions as M161 and Y87 in\nIsPETase. With the goal of restoring the otherwise\nconserved \u03c0-stacking clamp, we tested single muta-\ntions by substituting T88 with either T88W, T88F, or\nT88Y. These mutations led to a reduction of total prod-\nuct release by almost half of the wild-type enzyme\n(Figure\nS4a). A similar result was observed for the\nQ157M mutation. Here, we intended to restore\nthe highly conserved methionine and reduce the polar-\nity in the active site. Neither the restoration of the\n\u03c0-stacking clamp nor the reintroduction of the highly\nconserved methionine showed improved total product\nreleases. We assume that other factors may play a\nrole. For example, larger structural changes affecting\nenzymatic activity or a reduction in thermostability\nmight be responsible for the lower product releases\nunder these reaction conditions. The restoration of the\n\u03c0-stacking clamp might also require further mutations\nfor a cooperative effect to enable the correct architec-\nture for a\u03c0-stacking clamp. Amino acids in the vicinity\nof the introduced aromatic residues might not pair well\ndue to unfavorable interactions or steric hindrances.\nFor example, residue L163 ofHaloPETase1 is appar-\nently placed between the putative \u03c0-stacking clamp,\npossibly blocking the insertion of the substrate\nbetween the aromatic residues (Figure\nS4b). It should\nbe noted that this residue is placed on a unique and\nextended loop which is not observed for IsPETase.\nDue to the existence of this loop, no equivalent resi-\ndue for Q157 in IsPETase could be derived for\nHaloPETase1.\nFIGURE 2 Structure and sequence features ofHaloPETase1 in comparison to previously characterized PETases. (a) Crystal structure of\nHaloPETase1 with a resolution of 1.16 \u00c5 (PDB code9hl5). Cartoon representation of the protein backbone overlayed with a surface\nrepresentation.

Residues\nfrom IsPETase are shown as gray sticks. Only residue Q119 from subsite I ofIsPETase is shown in brackets as no equivalent residue could be\nderived forHaloPETase1. (c) Amino acid occupation at the catalytic site, subsites I and II, the extended loop region, and the presence of one or\ntwo disulfide bonds of representative PETases from type I (LCC), IIa (PE-H), IIb (IsPETase) andHaloPETase1. The catalytic triad, subsites I and\nII are highlighted by the same colors as in\u201cb\u201d, thus corresponding to these structure sites.\n6o f1 5 TURAK ET AL.\n\nThe extended loop region, which is known for type II\nPETases, is present inHaloPETase1 as well. However,\nonly P239 and G241 inHaloPETase1 are also present at\nequivalent positions in LCC (type I) and PE-H (type IIa).\nWe found similarities to other PETase types in sub-\nsite II ofHaloPETase1. The amino acid occupation at\nthis part of the active site resembles that of LCC (type\nI). The only difference is the presence of T94, which is\nS101 in the case of LCC (type I). A serine seems to be\nconserved at this position in other PETases: S104 in\nPE-H (type IIa) and S93 inIsPETase (type IIb).\n2.4 | A characteristic active site\narchitecture ofHaloPETase1 and\nhomologs\nThe structural alignment of HaloPETase1 and IsPE-\nTase at subsite I indicates that Q119 (IsPETase) is\nlocated on a loop that is distinct from the corresponding\nloop of HaloPETase1 (Figure 2b,c). Therefore, no cor-\nresponding residue could be derived forHaloPETase1.\nThis difference was also observed for spatially similar\nloops from representative PETases of other types, such\nas LCC (type I, Y129) and PE-H (type IIa, Q130)\n(Figure\n3a). In contrast, HaloPETase1 has a distinct\nand extended loop (loop 3) due to an insertion of five\namino acids (Figure\n4a,b). Notably, L163 in HaloPE-\nTase1, not observed for other PETases, is located on\nthis loop and is potentially involved in substrate\nbinding.\nAnother characteristic loop (loop 2) was observed,\nclose to loop 3, where in other PETases a residue of\nsubsite I is present, for example, Q119 ofIsPETase or\nY95 of LCC. Overall, loop 2 is shorter than correspond-\ning loops of other PETases by five amino acids\n(Figure\n4b). There is potentially no residue on loop 2 of\nHaloPETase1 directly involved in substrate binding.\nNevertheless, loop 2 flanks the active site and is in\nclose contact with loops 1 and 3, indicating an indirect\neffect on substrate binding. Finally, loop 1 ofHaloPE-\nTase1 shows a similar amino acid composition and has\nthe same length as IsPETase and LCC. However, a\nmajor difference is the missing aromatic residue for the\n\u03c0-stacking interaction with the substrate. Note that loop\n1 in PE-H is longer than in other PETases (Bollinger,\nThies, Knieps-Gr\u00fcnhagen, et al.,\n2020).\nBased on these observations, we performed\nanother pHMM search in the proteome ofHalopseudo-\nmonas with a profile consisting of already biochemically\ncharacterized PETases. The goal was to identify more\nPETases resembling HaloPETase1. We identified hit\nsequences with bit-scores ranging from 125.2 to 412.4\n(Table\nS4). The hits were separated into a low bit score\n[<200] and a high bit-score [>200] group."

The subsite I does not consist of a\n\u03c0-stacking clamp and has different amino acids forming\nthe oxyanion hole. Additionally, one amino acid could\nnot be derived from the structural alignment withIsPE-\nTase due to the existence of another extended loop at\nthis position. We identified two disulfide bonds as in\ntype II PETases, but these were located at different\npositions.\n2.5 | Sequence characterization of\nHaloPETase1 homologs\nConstruction of an unrooted phylogenetic tree with hit\nprotein sequences (see TableS4) illustrated the sepa-\nration into two sub-clades, indicating two sequentially\ndistinct groups (see Figure\n4a). The hit sequences\noccurred in one of the two sub-clades according to their\nassigned bit-scores.\nCurrently known PETases consist of a lipase-box\nmotif which includes the catalytic serine and has the\nG-X-S-X-G sequence. For example, type I PETases\nsuch as LCC and PHL7 have a G-H-S-M-G (Richter\net al.,\n2023; Tournier et al.,2020) and type II PETases\nsuch asHaes_PE-H (type IIa) andIsPETase (type IIb)\nhave a G-W-S-M-G motif (Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-\nGr\u00fcnhagen, et al.,2020; Yoshida et al.,2016). The high\nbit-score group represents the lipase-box motif G-W-S-\nM-G as other type II PETases. Notably, LCC andIsPE-\nTase, as indicated in the tree, are more closely related\nto the high bit-score than the low bit-score group. Pair-\nwise sequence alignment identities of IsPETase and\nLCC with all hits from the high and low bit-score groups\nsupport this observation: the sequence identity of\nTURAK ET AL. 7o f1 5\n\nIsPETase and LCC ranges from 46% to 54% for high\nbit-score sequence alignments (Figure S5), whereas\nthe sequence identities for both PETases ranged from\n23% to 31% for low bit-score sequence alignments\n(Figure\nS6). Finally, hits in the low bit-score group\nrepresent the lipase-box motif G-H-S-Q-G (see\nFigure\nS10), which we observed for the PET-degrading\nenzyme PmC and the newly characterized HaloPE-\nTase1 (see MSA in FigureS7).\nWe included HaloPETase1 in the phylogenetic tree\nand observed that it can be found in the sub-clade with\nother low bit-score hits (Figure4a). HaloPETase1 shows\nhigh sequence identities to other hit sequences in the\nsame group, ranging from 63% to 98% (FigureS5). In\ncontrast, sequence identities in the high bit-score group\nare much lower, ranging from 26% to 32% (Figure\nS6).\nOther previous large screenings for the identification\nof novel PETases have intentionally left out homologs\nFIGURE 3 Loops surrounding the active sites in representative PETases from type I, IIa, IIb, andHaloPETases.

      "heading": "3 | CONCLUSION",
      "text": "In this study, we present highly halo-tolerant PETases\nfrom the bacterial lineage of Halopseudomonas. Our\nbioinformatic analysis shows that there are two PETase\ngroups in this lineage, whereby HaloPETases5 and\n6 are more closely related to existing PETases such as\nLCC and IsPETase. More specifically, the sequences\nof these enzymes resemble type IIa PETases such as\nHaes_PE-H. In contrast, HaloPETases1, 2, 3, and\n4 form a distinct active site, which is especially seen in\nthe amino acid composition of subsite I and in the\nextended loop region. No typical \u03c0-stacking clamp\ncould be identified, and an atypical lipase-box motif for\nbacterial PETases (G-H-S-Q-G) was observed. In addi-\ntion, there are two disulfide bonds that are located at\ndifferent positions in comparison to the ones found in\nother PETase types. Loops surrounding the active site\nshowed either an extended or shortened length com-\npared to known PETases. Therefore, we could not cat-\negorize these enzymes according to the widely\naccepted classification system for PETases (Joo et al.,\n2018; Richter et al.,2023). We propose an extension of\nthis PETase classification system by type III PETases\nthat includeHaloPETase1, 2, 3, and 4, as well asPmC\nand dsPETase05.\nWe believe that the identification ofHaloPETases\nenables the discovery of further polyesterases in the\nbacterial lineage of Halopseudomonas, especially\nFIGURE 4 Phylogenetic tree of putative PETases fromHaloPETase1 homologs in the proteome ofHalopseudomonas.
