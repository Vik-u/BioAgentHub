Abstract
The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a
sustainable solution for PET recycling. Over the past two decades, more
than 100 PETases have been characterized, primarily exhibiting similar
sequences and structures. Here, we report PET-degradingα/β hydrolases,
including HaloPETase1 from the marine Halopseudomonas lineage,
thereby extending the narrow sequence space by novel features at the
active site. The crystal structure ofHaloPETase1 was determined to a reso-
lution of 1.16 Å, revealing a unique active site architecture and a lack of the
canonical π-stacking clamp found in PETases so far. Further, variations in
active site composition and loop structures were observed. Additionally, we
found five more enzymes from the same lineage, two of which have a high
similarity to type IIa bacterial PETases, while the other three resembleHalo-
PETase1. All these enzymes exhibited high salt tolerance ranging from 2.5
to 5 M NaCl, leading to higher total product releases upon PET degradation
at 40 or 50
/C14 C. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of the
existing PETase classification system to include type III PETases.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The recycling of commodity plastics is currently under
extensive investigation, mainly motivated by the need
to mitigate environmental plastic pollution and reduce
unsustainable resource depletion (Environment, U. N.,
2023). This is supported by recent efforts towards a
legally binding UN plastic treaty, which emphasizes
plastic recycling as a key component of a holistic
approach to mitigating plastic pollution (Environment,
U. N.,
2022). However, only 9% of plastic waste is glob-
ally recycled (Geyer et al., 2017). This indicates the
need for improvement of the current recycling
infrastructure for the implementation of a circular econ-
omy for plastics.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an aromatic
polyester and one of the commodity plastics that is
widely recycled in comparison to other plastics, such as
polypropylene, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride
(Ritchie et al.,
2023). The use of enzymes for the recy-
cling of PET can provide an almost complete conver-
sion to monomeric starting materials such as
terephthalic acid (TPA) (Cui et al.,
2024; Pfaff et al.,
2022; Tournier et al.,2020). This product can be incor-
porated into the production of new PET (recycling) (Lu
et al., 2022) or the synthesis of new and valuable

chemicals such as vanillin (upcycling) (Sadler &
Wallace, 2021). Enzymatic recycling enables the selec-
tive de-polymerization of PET without losing material
properties (downcycling), which can be the case for
mechanical recycling, and requires generally less harsh
reaction conditions, for example, milder temperatures
and aqueous buffers, in contrast to chemical recycling
(Carniel et al.,
2021).
Enzymes such as improved variants of leaf-branch
cutinase (LCC) (Tournier et al., 2020) and polyester
hydrolase 7 (PHL7 (Richter et al.,2023; Sonnendecker
et al., 2022), also called PES-H1 (Pfaff et al.,2022))
are potential candidates for their application in industrial
PET recycling (Arnal et al., 2023; Fritzsche et al.,
2023). These enzymes de-polymerize low crystalline
PET at the glass transition temperature (65–75/C14 C) quite
efficiently (Thomsen et al.,2022). However, most of the
post-consumer PET (pcPET) waste has a crystallinity
up to 45%, leading to a drastic reduction of the enzy-
matic rates (Thomsen et al.,
2022; Thomsen et al.,
2024). Contaminants, additives, and polymer blends,
as well as the size of the plastic, can affect the same,
and thus, the energy- and water-demanding cleaning,
sorting, and pre-treatment of pcPET for crystallinity
reduction is key for efficient enzymatic de-
polymerization (Singh et al.,
2021; Uekert et al.,2022).
Current PETases are already quite optimized and show
relatively high de-polymerization rates at the glass tran-
sition temperature, but the challenges remain. This
leaves the future role of enzymes for PET recycling
undefined. Novel enzymes with, for example, the ability
to degrade high crystalline PET or a tolerance against
a wide range of reaction conditions could enhance the
sustainability of PET recycling (Uekert et al.,
2023) and
have an impact on the future role of enzymes in PET
recycling as a part of a circular plastic economy.
Here in this study, we apply a sequence homology
search in marine metagenomes from the Tara Oceans
project (Sunagawa et al.,2015) with the goal of identify-
ing more versatile enzymes. Several studies indicated
that marine-derived enzymes can be highly salt-,
pressure-, cold-, and organic solvent tolerant
(Ghattavi & Homaei,
2023; Sana et al.,2007; Wu et al.,
2015; Yang et al.,2018). Most recently, PET-degrading
enzymes with a NaCl tolerance up to 5 M were identi-
fied from the deep-sea, including areas such as hydro-
thermal vents (Chen et al.,
2024). Due to stability at
lower water activity in the presence of high ionic
strength or at low temperatures, these enzymes are
more likely to show organic solvent tolerance (Karan
et al.,
2012). In the context of PET depolymerization,
salt-tolerant PET hydrolases from marine environments
are promising candidates for harsh conditions, poten-
tially enabling whole-cell applications without extensive
engineering (Wei et al.,
2025).
The need for more versatile enzymes mirrors the
need for an expansion of PETase sequence and
structure spaces (Xu et al., 2023). Over the past
10 years, more than 100 PETases, that is, PET-
degrading α/β hydrolases, were identified and biochem-
ically characterized (see also PAZy database
[Buchholz et al., 2022]). These enzymes originate
mostly from bacteria such asPseudomonadota, Actino-
mycetota, and Bacillota. Since these enzymes were
mainly identified by sequence homology searches par-
tially based on already identified PETases (Danso
et al.,
2018), they exhibit similar sequence and struc-
ture properties. Later enzymes with more diversity were
found. These PETases showed to some extent higher
thermostabilities (Erickson et al.,
2022) or originated
from archaea instead of bacteria (Perez-Garcia
et al.,2023).
Although bacterial PETases show higher similari-
ties, they can be distinguished based on some struc-
ture and sequence differences (Joo et al.,2018). The
following criteria are used for categorization: the occur-
rence and position of disulfide bonds, the amino acid
composition at the active sites (subsite I and II), and
the occurrence of an extended loop flanking the active
site. A representative of type I enzymes is LCC. These
PETases show one disulfide bond at a conserved posi-
tion and have no extended loop region surrounding
their active site. Type II enzymes have two conserved
disulfide bonds and show an extended loop region.
Representatives are commonly mesophilic enzymes in
contrast to PETases from type I. Type II is further sub-
divided into type IIa and IIb, whereby these two differ in
their amino acid composition in subsite II and the
extended loop region. The benchmark IsPETase is
classified as a type IIb PETase and consists of a stabi-
lizing disulfide bond close to its active site. A represen-
tative of type IIa PETases is polyester hydrolase
(PE-H) from the marine bacteriumPseudomonas aes-
tusnigri (Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-Grünhagen, et al.,
2020). This bacterium belongs to the bacterial lineage
Halopseudomonas (formerly Pseudomonas pertucino-
gena [Rudra & Gupta,2021]), which has been a good
source for the identification of PET-degrading enzymes
(Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020), such as
PE-H from H. aestusnigri (Haes_PE-H) (Bollinger,
Thies, Knieps-Grünhagen, et al., 2020), PE-H from
H. formosensis (Hfor_PE-H) (de Witt et al.,2024), or
PbauzCut from H. bauzanensis (Avilan et al., 2023).
Bioinformatic analysis further suggested putative
PETases in H. sabulinigri , H. pachastrellae , and
H. litoralis (Joo et al.,2018). All of these are classified
as type IIa PETases.
In this study, we characterize six novel PETases
from the bacterial genusHalopseudomonas. We show
that four enzymes (HaloPETase1, 2, 3, and 4) cannot
be categorized into one of the known PETase types.
Therefore, we establish together with other character-
ized PETases the new bacterial PETase type III and
explore by bioinformatic analyses more homologs of
2o f1 5 TURAK ET AL.

this type in the proteome ofHalopseudomonas. In addi-
tion, we test the so far sparsely explored salt tolerance
of PETases originating fromHalopseudomonas. These
enzymes show improved PET degradation in the pres-
ence of 2.5 to 5 M NaCl. Thus, we (1) provide enzymes
for PET degradation in a high-salt environment. This
might enable the use of these enzymes under more
chemically demanding conditions for PET waste man-
agement. (2) We explore and highlight the potential of
the Halopseudomonas lineage as a source for
PETases or other biotechnologically useful polyes-
terases. And (3), we extend the narrow sequence
space of PETases and enable the search for novel
enzymes by covering more diverse candidates.
2 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1 | Screening for novel PETases
To identify PETases from the marine environment, a
profile hidden Markov-Model (pHMM) search was
applied to marine bacterial metagenomes, published by
the Tara Oceans project (Sunagawa et al., 2015).
Twenty target proteins that showed a bit-score higher
than 100 were selected to analyze their ability for PET
degradation. These proteins were recombinantly pro-
duced in E. coli. Subsequently, purified proteins were
spotted onto PBS-agar plates supplemented with either
BHET, PET-NP, or PCL to characterize their enzymatic
activity towards these substrates.
We observed the formation of zones of clearances
(halos) for 14 target proteins towards all substrates
(Figure
S1 and TableS1). Three hits, PSW62-1,Halo-
PETase1, and ASW29-1, indicated halos on PET-
plates after 7 days of incubation at 30/C14 C. We ana-
lyzed their affiliation and identified the origin of their
gene sequences in metagenomes associated with
Pseudomonas sp. According to a BLASTp search in
non-redundant protein databases, PSW62-1 and
ASW29-1 have a sequence identity of 89.2% with the
PET-active polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from Halop-
seudomonas aestusnigri (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, &
Jaeger, 2020). In the case of HaloPETase1, a cuti-
nase from Pseudomonas mendocina (PmC) was the
closest related and characterized PETase (Ronkvist
et al., 2009) until later on, Chen et al. (2024) pub-
lished dsPETase05, a salt-tolerant PETase from the
North Su hydrothermal vent (Chen et al.,
2024)t h a t
shares over 98% sequence identity with HaloPE-
Tase1. Due to sequence identities of 62.4% withPmC
and sequence identities of <34% to PETases from
type I and II (see TableS2), we concluded thatHalo-
PETase1 is a promising candidate for the extension
of the narrow sequence space of currently known
PETases.
2.2 | Quantification and optimization of
PET-degradation byHaloPETase1
HaloPETase1 was produced and tested in the func-
tional agar screening with an N-10xHis-SUMO-tag. For
subsequent experiments, the tag was removed from
the enzyme during purification (see also Figure
S2 for
SDS-polyacrylamide gel). We investigated the PET
degradation (Figure1) conditions byHaloPETase1 first
using PET-coated well-plates (Weigert et al.,2021) and
then using in solution immersed PET films to assess
the potential of this enzyme.
HaloPETase1 was found in marine metagenomes
and includes an N-terminal signal peptide indicating
that the protein is likely secreted into the saline marine
environment. Therefore, we tested degradation of PET
using a NaCl gradient ranging from 0.25 to 2 M at
40, 50, and 60
/C14 C (Figure1a). The highest total product
release at 40/C14 C after 20 h was observed in the enzyme
solution with 1 M NaCl (Figure 1b), whereby higher
NaCl concentrations led to a decreased product
release. Since the total product release increased con-
tinuously from 0.25 to 2 M NaCl at 50
/C14 C, we assumed
that NaCl concentrations higher than 2 M would lead to
even higher total product releases. Consequently, we
also tested PET degradation at 50, 60, and 68
/C14 C with
up to 5 M NaCl. Notably, the optimal NaCl concentra-
tions increased with higher reaction temperatures
(Figure
1b). We observed the highest total product
release at 50/C14 C with 3 M NaCl. At 60/C14 C, it decreased in
comparison to the PET degradation at 50/C14 C, but the
NaCl optimum increased to 4 M. Similarly, at 68/C14 C
the total product release was even lower than at 60/C14 C,
but the NaCl optimum increased even up to 5 M.
To test the effect of NaCl on the enzymatic thermo-
stability, we incubated HaloPETase1 up to 3 days at
50, 60, and 68/C14 C with either 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl. Subse-
quently, the residual activity was measured by apara-
nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) assay (Figure S3). The
residual activity after 72 h at 50/C14 C with 5 M NaCl appar-
ently did not decrease. However, we observed a reduc-
tion of the residual activity to 49% and 74% with 1 and
3 M NaCl after 72 h, respectively. At 60
/C14 C, the residual
activity dropped to 0.6% with 1 M NaCl after 4 days,
while with NaCl concentrations of 3 and 5 M it
decreased to 2.7% and 15.3%, respectively, after 72 h
at the same temperature. Finally, at 68
/C14 C, no more
residual activity could be observed for all NaCl concen-
trations after 1 h. Taken together, these results indicate
a stabilizing effect of high NaCl concentrations on
HaloPETase1 at higher temperatures.
Next, we investigated the pH dependent degrada-
tion in the PET-coated well-plate setup with 100 nM
HaloPETase1. We observed that the highest total prod-
uct release at 50
/C14 C with 3 M NaCl occurs at pH values
between 9.5 and 10, as indicated by the sum of TPA,

MHET and BHET concentrations (Figure1c). The deg-
radation of PET with sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8
mainly led to the formation of MHET. However, the deg-
radation of PET with CAPS buffer at pH 10.5 mainly led
to the formation of TPA. Both conditions, nevertheless,
indicated similar total product releases.
After identifying the apparent optimal enzyme concen-
tration within this experimental framework (Figure
1d), we
performed buffer and pH-dependent PET-degradation
experiments with 500 nMHaloPETase1. The release of
acidic products, such as MHET or TPA, during enzymatic
hydrolysis of PET can reduce the pH if not sufficiently

buffered. This can affect the enzymatic rates due to
effects on protein stability and activity. Further, the choice
of buffer can have a concentration-dependent effect on
enzyme rates of PETases as well (Schmidt et al.,
2016).
Thus, we increased the buffer concentrations to 0.1 M to
gain a higher total product release. When degradation
was tested at pH 7.5 with sodium phosphate or pH 9.5
with carbonate or borate buffer, total product releases
increased, yielding between 5 and 6 mM (Figure
1e). In
the case of 0.1 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.5, <2 mM total
product release was observed, indicating an inhibiting
effect of this buffer.
Further, we analyzed PET-degradation byHaloPE-
Tase1 using medium crystallinity PET-films ( /C24 15%
crystallinity [see also Figure S11], 150–200 μm thick-
ness, 1 cm/C2 1 cm, /C24 40 mg) in a weight-loss experi-
ment (Figure1f). Here, PET films were immersed in an
enzyme solution for 7 days at 50/C14 C, and the weight loss
of the films was subsequently measured. Due to differ-
ences in the PET-coated well plate and PET-film
assays, the optimal enzyme concentration had to be re-
evaluated. The highest weight loss ( /C24 25%) was
observed with 0.5μM HaloPETase1. An increase in the
enzyme concentration to 1 and 2 μM showed lower
weight losses of about 20% and 17%, respectively.
Correspondingly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs were acquired to analyze changes in the
surface topography of the PET films after immersion in
the enzyme solution (Figure
1g). In comparison to the
negative control (only buffer treated PET film), the sur-
face of the 0.5μM HaloPETase1 treated film showed
the formation of pit-hole-like topographies with diame-
ters ranging from 10 to 20μm. Similar topography has
been observed previously for the thermostable PETase
PHL7, where larger pits were seen on PET-disks with a
similar crystallinity (15.8%) upon treatment (Thomsen
et al.,
2023). Notably, crystal-like formation on the trea-
ted film surfaces may indicate NaCl crystals due to
buffer conditions.
To compare the PETase-activity ofHaloPETase1 to
the benchmark PETase LCC-iccg (an activity and ther-
mostability improved variant) (Tournier et al.,2020), we
performed a hydrolysis time course measurement in a
PET-coated well plate. Apparently, HaloPETase1 is
inactive at 50/C14 C in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl. How-
ever, increasing the NaCl concentration up to 3 M leads
to a total product release of about 1 mM after 7.5 h. In
contrast, the improved LCC-iccg performs similarly at
low and high NaCl concentrations, in both cases reach-
ing a total product release of about 2.5 mM after 7.5 h.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
HaloPETase1 degrades PET in both the PET-coated
well-plate assay and the solution immersed PET-film
assay. HaloPETase1 is a salt-tolerant enzyme and
depends on higher salt concentrations for the degrada-
tion of PET at elevated temperatures. These results
align well with observations made for dsPETase05
(Chen et al.,
2024).
2.3 | Structure and sequence
classification ofHaloPETase1
Bacterial PETases can be classified as type I, type IIa,
and type IIb based on their structural and sequence
features near their active sites (Joo et al.,
2018; Richter
et al.,2023), such as the presence of an extended loop
surrounding the active site, the number and position of
disulfide bonds, and the amino acid composition at sub-
sites I and II. Type I PETases have no extended loop
regions and show one disulfide bond. In contrast, type
II PETases have extended loop regions and two disul-
fide bonds; they are further subdivided into type IIa and
IIb based on differences in the extended loop regions.
To better classify HaloPETase1, we elucidated its
X-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 1.16 Å (PDB
code:
9hl5, Table S3) and compared it to existing
PETases (Figure 2). HaloPETase1 has the canonical
α/β hydrolase fold illustrating highly conserved spatial
positions for its catalytic residues S156, D206, and
H236 as known forIsPETase (type IIb). There are two
disulfide bonds observed: Db I (C64-C126) and Db II
(C273-C276) (Figure
2a). While two bonds are charac-
teristic for type II PETases, these are, however, located
at different positions in HaloPETase1. Notably, we
could not observe a disulfide bond flanking the active
site, as it is known forIsPETase (Joo et al.,
2018).
Previous structure analyses on the binding mode of
PET substrate modules to PETases suggested an aro-
matic interaction between the benzene moiety of the
substrate with two opposing aromatic amino acids at
the active site. For example, PHL7 (type I) indicated a
distorted T-shaped π–π-interaction of F63 and W156
with the benzene moiety of TPA in a co-crystal struc-
ture (Richter et al.,
2023). Similarly,IsPETase showed,
depending on the study, up to twoπ-π interactions by
Y87 and W185 (docking of tetrameric PET module and
mutational analysis) (Joo et al., 2018) or W185
(QM/MM analysis or complex crystal structure with
HEMT) (Burgin et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2021). Alto-
gether, type I and II PETases consist of two opposing
aromatic amino acids such as Y/F and W at equivalent
positions to F63 and W156 in PHL7, and Y87 and
W185 inIsPETase.
In HaloPETase1, on the other hand, we observed
the non-conserved aromatic acid Y180 in subsite I
(equivalent to W185 inIsPETase, Figure
2b,c), which
might form aπ-stacking interaction with the substrate.
However, instead of an aromatic residue at the equiva-
lent position of Y87 in IsPETase, we found T88 for
HaloPETase1. Thus, the so-calledπ-stacking “clamp”
does not exist for HaloPETase1. Further, we
TURAK ET AL. 5o f1 5

hypothesize that the backbone amide protons of T88
and Q157 are responsible for the formation of the oxy-
anion hole in HaloPETase1 since these residues are
located at equivalent positions as M161 and Y87 in
IsPETase. With the goal of restoring the otherwise
conserved π-stacking clamp, we tested single muta-
tions by substituting T88 with either T88W, T88F, or
T88Y. These mutations led to a reduction of total prod-
uct release by almost half of the wild-type enzyme
(Figure
S4a). A similar result was observed for the
Q157M mutation. Here, we intended to restore
the highly conserved methionine and reduce the polar-
ity in the active site. Neither the restoration of the
π-stacking clamp nor the reintroduction of the highly
conserved methionine showed improved total product
releases. We assume that other factors may play a
role. For example, larger structural changes affecting
enzymatic activity or a reduction in thermostability
might be responsible for the lower product releases
under these reaction conditions. The restoration of the
π-stacking clamp might also require further mutations
for a cooperative effect to enable the correct architec-
ture for aπ-stacking clamp. Amino acids in the vicinity
of the introduced aromatic residues might not pair well
due to unfavorable interactions or steric hindrances.
For example, residue L163 ofHaloPETase1 is appar-
ently placed between the putative π-stacking clamp,
possibly blocking the insertion of the substrate
between the aromatic residues (Figure
S4b). It should
be noted that this residue is placed on a unique and
extended loop which is not observed for IsPETase.
Due to the existence of this loop, no equivalent resi-
due for Q157 in IsPETase could be derived for
HaloPETase1.

II are highlighted by the same colors as in“b”, thus corresponding to these structure sites.

The extended loop region, which is known for type II
PETases, is present inHaloPETase1 as well. However,
only P239 and G241 inHaloPETase1 are also present at
equivalent positions in LCC (type I) and PE-H (type IIa).
We found similarities to other PETase types in sub-
site II ofHaloPETase1. The amino acid occupation at
this part of the active site resembles that of LCC (type
I). The only difference is the presence of T94, which is
S101 in the case of LCC (type I). A serine seems to be
conserved at this position in other PETases: S104 in
PE-H (type IIa) and S93 inIsPETase (type IIb).
2.4 | A characteristic active site
architecture ofHaloPETase1 and
homologs
The structural alignment of HaloPETase1 and IsPE-
Tase at subsite I indicates that Q119 (IsPETase) is
located on a loop that is distinct from the corresponding
loop of HaloPETase1 (Figure 2b,c). Therefore, no cor-
responding residue could be derived forHaloPETase1.
This difference was also observed for spatially similar
loops from representative PETases of other types, such
as LCC (type I, Y129) and PE-H (type IIa, Q130)
(Figure
3a). In contrast, HaloPETase1 has a distinct
and extended loop (loop 3) due to an insertion of five
amino acids (Figure
4a,b). Notably, L163 in HaloPE-
Tase1, not observed for other PETases, is located on
this loop and is potentially involved in substrate
binding.
Another characteristic loop (loop 2) was observed,
close to loop 3, where in other PETases a residue of
subsite I is present, for example, Q119 ofIsPETase or
Y95 of LCC. Overall, loop 2 is shorter than correspond-
ing loops of other PETases by five amino acids
(Figure
4b). There is potentially no residue on loop 2 of
HaloPETase1 directly involved in substrate binding.
Nevertheless, loop 2 flanks the active site and is in
close contact with loops 1 and 3, indicating an indirect
effect on substrate binding. Finally, loop 1 ofHaloPE-
Tase1 shows a similar amino acid composition and has
the same length as IsPETase and LCC. However, a
major difference is the missing aromatic residue for the
π-stacking interaction with the substrate. Note that loop
1 in PE-H is longer than in other PETases (Bollinger,
Thies, Knieps-Grünhagen, et al.,
2020).
Based on these observations, we performed
another pHMM search in the proteome ofHalopseudo-
monas with a profile consisting of already biochemically
characterized PETases. The goal was to identify more
PETases resembling HaloPETase1. We identified hit
sequences with bit-scores ranging from 125.2 to 412.4
(Table
S4). The hits were separated into a low bit score
[<200] and a high bit-score [>200] group.
Upon modeling the 3D-structures ofHaloPETase1
homologs from the low bit-score group in ColabFold
(Mirdita et al., 2022) we found the same active site
backbone architecture (see Figure 3c). Thus, loops
directly involved or flanking the active site (loop 1–3)
appear conserved. This is also seen in the amino acid
composition and frequency of their occurrence in
respective loops, as shown in Figure3d.
In addition to these conserved loops, we found
highly conserved amino acids in parts of the active site
(logo plot in FigureS10). All amino acids in subsite I
among these homologs (orange letters in FigureS10)
are strictly conserved (alignment positions T94, Q163,
and Y186). Subsite II composition indicates more vari-
ance at the following alignment positions: G/T95, A/S/
G96, T/G100, H161, and F243. Finally, the extended
loop region also indicates more variability: P245, V/A/
I246, G/S/N247, N/D/S248, A/G249, G250, D/G/E251,
and Y/F252. The known PETase with the highest
sequence identity toHaloPETase1 (62.4% identity, see
Table
S2), PmC, also shows high sequence similarity
to low bit-scoreHaloPETases, includingHaloPETase2,
3, and 4 (MSA in FigureS7).
In conclusion, we observed that conserved features
of the existing PETase types I, IIa, and IIb were missing
in HaloPETase1. The subsite I does not consist of a
π-stacking clamp and has different amino acids forming
the oxyanion hole. Additionally, one amino acid could
not be derived from the structural alignment withIsPE-
Tase due to the existence of another extended loop at
this position. We identified two disulfide bonds as in
type II PETases, but these were located at different
positions.
2.5 | Sequence characterization of
HaloPETase1 homologs
Construction of an unrooted phylogenetic tree with hit
protein sequences (see TableS4) illustrated the sepa-
ration into two sub-clades, indicating two sequentially
distinct groups (see Figure
4a). The hit sequences
occurred in one of the two sub-clades according to their
assigned bit-scores.
Currently known PETases consist of a lipase-box
motif which includes the catalytic serine and has the
G-X-S-X-G sequence. For example, type I PETases
such as LCC and PHL7 have a G-H-S-M-G (Richter
et al.,
2023; Tournier et al.,2020) and type II PETases
such asHaes_PE-H (type IIa) andIsPETase (type IIb)
have a G-W-S-M-G motif (Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-
Grünhagen, et al.,2020; Yoshida et al.,2016). The high
bit-score group represents the lipase-box motif G-W-S-
M-G as other type II PETases. Notably, LCC andIsPE-
Tase, as indicated in the tree, are more closely related
to the high bit-score than the low bit-score group. Pair-
wise sequence alignment identities of IsPETase and
LCC with all hits from the high and low bit-score groups
support this observation: the sequence identity of
TURAK ET AL. 7o f1 5

IsPETase and LCC ranges from 46% to 54% for high
bit-score sequence alignments (Figure S5), whereas
the sequence identities for both PETases ranged from
23% to 31% for low bit-score sequence alignments
(Figure
S6). Finally, hits in the low bit-score group
represent the lipase-box motif G-H-S-Q-G (see
Figure
S10), which we observed for the PET-degrading
enzyme PmC and the newly characterized HaloPE-
Tase1 (see MSA in FigureS7).
We included HaloPETase1 in the phylogenetic tree
and observed that it can be found in the sub-clade with
other low bit-score hits (Figure4a). HaloPETase1 shows
high sequence identities to other hit sequences in the
same group, ranging from 63% to 98% (FigureS5). In
contrast, sequence identities in the high bit-score group
are much lower, ranging from 26% to 32% (Figure
S6).
Other previous large screenings for the identification
of novel PETases have intentionally left out homologs

of HaloPETase1 due to their low sequence identities to
reported PETases (Erickson et al.,2022). For example,
in a recently published large-scale search for novel
PETases (Seo et al.,2025), HaloPETase1, while pre-
sent in the initial set of non-redundant alpha/beta
hydrolases, was eliminated immediately due to low
sequence identity even before testing activity
towards PET.
2.6 | HaloPETase1 homologs
degrade PET
We selected three hit sequences from the low (HaloPE-
Tase2, 3, 4) and two from the high bit-score clade
(HaloPETase5, 6) as representative candidates from
both bit-score groups for testing their PET hydrolysis
activity (see Figure
4b for pHMM bit-scores). The hits
from this representative set are all located on one
metagenome-derived genome of H. sabulinigri
HyVt376 obtained from a marine hydrothermal vent site
sediment (Zhou, 2020) (see boldly highlighted target
proteins in TableS4). The selected enzymes were pro-
duced by heterologous expression inE. coli(Figure S2)
and tested for PET degradation (FigureS9). LikeHalo-
PETase1, all enzymes showed hydrolysis activity on
PET-coated well plates at high concentrations of NaCl.
HaloPETase2-6 indicated apparent optima between
2.5 and 5 M NaCl and 40 to 50
/C14 C (see Figure4c).
3 | CONCLUSION
In this study, we present highly halo-tolerant PETases
from the bacterial lineage of Halopseudomonas. Our
bioinformatic analysis shows that there are two PETase
groups in this lineage, whereby HaloPETases5 and
6 are more closely related to existing PETases such as
LCC and IsPETase. More specifically, the sequences
of these enzymes resemble type IIa PETases such as
Haes_PE-H. In contrast, HaloPETases1, 2, 3, and
4 form a distinct active site, which is especially seen in
the amino acid composition of subsite I and in the
extended loop region. No typical π-stacking clamp
could be identified, and an atypical lipase-box motif for
bacterial PETases (G-H-S-Q-G) was observed. In addi-
tion, there are two disulfide bonds that are located at
different positions in comparison to the ones found in
other PETase types. Loops surrounding the active site
showed either an extended or shortened length com-
pared to known PETases. Therefore, we could not cat-
egorize these enzymes according to the widely
accepted classification system for PETases (Joo et al.,
2018; Richter et al.,2023). We propose an extension of
this PETase classification system by type III PETases
that includeHaloPETase1, 2, 3, and 4, as well asPmC
and dsPETase05.
We believe that the identification ofHaloPETases
enables the discovery of further polyesterases in the
bacterial lineage of Halopseudomonas, especially

PETases of type III. This notion is supported by the dis-
covery of several homologs in the low bit-score group
(type III), including the here-characterized HaloPE-
Tases1, 2, 3, and 4. These enzymes form a distinct
subclade among other PETases, as indicated by our
phylogenetic analysis (green subclade in Figure S8).
This subclade also includes known PETases such as
dsPETase05 andPmC, which categorize these as type
III as well. In addition, we identified further homologs in
the high bit-score group (type IIa), which include PET-
degrading enzymes from other studies (Avilan et al.,
2023; Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-Grünhagen, et al.,2020)
and the herein presentedHaloPETase5, and 6. These
homologs form a branch in the subclade of type I and
other type II PETases (magenta subclade in FigureS8).
The identification of PETase type III provides new
and distinct sequences. Inclusion of these sequences in
future homology searches will enable further discovery
of distinct PETases with novel features, ultimately help-
ing to improve sustainable PET recycling by enzymes.
4 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 | Metagenomic mining for putative
PETase candidates in marine bacterial
metagenomes
To identify novel PETases with higher sequence and
structure diversity to known ones in the PAZy data-
base, a profile hidden-Markov model was prepared.
Shortly, the profile was generated with biochemically
characterized PETases, as reported previously
(Buchholz et al.,
2022), and a search was performed
against marine metagenomes from the Tara Oceans
(Sunagawa et al., 2015) and other publicly available
metagenomes (accession numbers PRJNA454581 and
PRJNA901861) with HMMER3 (Eddy, 1998). Hit-
sequences with a bit score higher than 100 were
selected for further filtering. The filtering was implemen-
ted by excluding duplicates and highly similar
sequences as well as sequences that did not include a
canonical catalytic triad with Ser-His-Asp. Additionally,
hits with more diverse bacterial origins in comparison to
existing affiliations were chosen. Finally, 20 target pro-
teins were selected for further analysis.
4.2 | Molecular cloning and target
protein production inE. coliMC1061
The corresponding target genes were truncated if
N-terminal signal sequences were present. These
sequences were identified by SignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,
2022). Molecular cloning was performed with the
fragment-exchange (FX)-cloning methodology, whereby
the truncated target genes were extended with recogni-
tion sites for the restriction enzymeSapI using the FX-
cloning tool (
https://www.fxcloning.org/) (Geertsma &
Dutzler, 2011). This cloning methodology leads to a sin-
gle amino acid overhang on each end (N-terminal serine
and C-terminal alanine) of the final gene product. Finally,
all target genes were codon-optimized for heterologous
expression in E. coli MC1061. The target genes were
cloned into the plasmid vectors p1 (Geertsma & Dutzler,
2011), p2, p3, or p12 (Bjerga et al.,2016), leading to the
attachment of an N-10xHis-, N-10xHis-Maltose-binding-
protein (MBP)-, N-10xHis-Small Ubiquitin-related MOdi-
fier (SUMO)- or C-6xHis-tag, respectively, to the final
protein. The positive control, LCC
ICCG, was cloned into
p12, and the negative control, namely a linker sequence
of GSGSGS, was cloned into each vector. Successful
cloning was tested by colony PCR and subsequent aga-
rose gel electrophoresis. Finally, genes were verified by
sequencing if the corresponding target protein showed
hydrolytic activity towards PET. Sequencing was also
performed for every negative and the positive control.
For heterologous gene expression in E. coli
MC1061, chemically competent bacteria were trans-
formed with the plasmid constructs. A pre-culture with
3 mL LB and 100μg/mL ampicillin was prepared by
inoculation and subsequent incubation at 37
/C14 C, over-
night and 180 rpm. Next, 20 mL 2YT medium with
100 μg/mL ampicillin in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask
(main culture) was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the pre-
culture and incubated at 140 rpm, 37
/C14 C for 2 to 3 h until
an OD600 /C24 0.6. Then, the main cultures were trans-
ferred to 18/C14 C and gene expression was induced by
adding 100 μL of a 20% (w/v) L-arabinose stock-
solution for a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). After
20 h, cultures were placed on ice, decanted into pre-
cooled 50 mL tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 4
/C14 C
and 3000/C2 g. Next, cell pellets were resuspended in
10 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 mM
imidazole. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and
the lysates centrifuged for 30 min at 4
/C14 C and 3000/C2 g.
The cleared cell lysate was used for further purification.
4.3 | Target protein purification by Ni-
immobilized metal affinity chromatography
(Ni-IMAC)
The soluble fractions of the poly-His-tagged target pro-
teins were subjected to a Ni-NTA column purification
using a HisPur™ Ni-NTA Spin Purification Kit (0.2 mL,
ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col. Finally, three 200 μL elution fractions were col-
lected and stored at 4/C14 C for a maximum of 2 days.
4.4 | Functional screening on substrate
supplemented agar plates
The production of agar plates supplemented with
respective substrates was adapted from Pérez-García
10 of 15 TURAK ET AL.

et al. (2021). PBS agar was prepared with 0.1 M PBS
and 1.5% (w/v) agar, sterilized by autoclaving, and
allowed to cool down to ca. 60/C14 C until substrate solu-
tions were added. 20 mL of substrate PBS agar was
dispensed into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify
under sterile conditions.
4.5 | Production of PET nanoparticle
(PET-NP) suspension and agar-plates
A stock PET-NP suspension was prepared by dissol-
ving 0.1 g thin pieces of a PET film (Goodfellow) in
10 mL 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaf luoro-2-propanol (HFIP,
Sigma-Aldrich) in a separatory funnel in the fume
hood. The solution was dropped slowly into 100 mL
pre-cooled and deionized water in a glass beaker
under vigorous mixing with an Ultra-Turrax ™ T25
basic (IKA Labortechnik). Residual HFIP was allowed
to evaporate for several days. The suspension
(ca. 0.3 mg/mL) was added to 200 mL molten PBS-
agar. In all PET-NP suspension preparations, precipi-
tation of PET was observed, which potentially
decreased the final concentration of PET-NPs after
filtration in the agar plates. Agar plates with sufficient
turbidity after visual inspection were used for further
experiments.
4.6 | Production of BHET solution and
agar-plates
A 1 M stock solution of Bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in DMSO. BHET-
containing PBS-agar plates were prepared with a final
concentration of 0.5 M BHET.
4.7 | Production of PCL solution and
agar-plates
0.25 g of PCL granules (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved
in 15 mL acetone at 60/C14 C. This solution was transferred
into 500 mL of PBS-agar.
4.8 | Functional screening of target
proteins
Twenty microliters of Ni-NTA purified target protein was
spotted onto PCL, BHET, or PET-NP supplemented
PBS-agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30
/C14 C
for 7 days. Enzymatic hydrolysis activity was detected
by the formation of zones of clearance (halos), which
became visible due to the decrease of turbidity on the
plate.
4.9 | Heterologous expression and
purification ofHaloPETase1 and single
mutants thereof
The codon-optimized gene sequence (without
N-terminal signal peptide) ofHaloPETase1 (GenBank
ID: MAB42154.1) was cloned into the p3 vector, which
leads to a protein with N-10xHis-SUMO-tag upon
expression. Chemically competent E. coli Shuffle® T7
(NEB) were transformed with the respective construct
and cultivated on LB-agar plates with 100μg/mL ampi-
cillin. A pre-culture was prepared in LB with 100μg/mL
ampicillin by cultivation overnight at 37/C14 C and 180 rpm.
A 2 L culture with TB medium and 100μg/mL ampicillin
in a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with 1% (v/v)
of the pre-culture and grown until an OD
600 of /C24 0.6 at
37/C14 C and 140 rpm. The culture was placed at 18/C14 C and
gene expression induced by adding 0.2% (v/v) from a
20% (w/v) L-Arabinose stock. Bacteria were harvested
after 20 h by centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed
in 20 mL PBS and subsequently frozen at/C0 20
/C14 C until
further use.
For purification, the cell pellets were thawed on ice
and resuspended in 40 mL of cold buffer A (50 mM
NaP
i, 50 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells
were lysed by sonication, and the supernatant collected
after centrifugation was subjected to a Ni-IMAC with a
5 mL HisTrap
® FF column (Cytiva) attached to an
ÄKTA pure™ (Cytiva) purification system. Elution was
performed by an imidazole gradient with buffer B
(50 mM NaPi, 500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4) ranging from 0 to 50% over 20 CV.
To cleave the N-10xHis-SUMO-tag from the target
protein, 2 mg of SUMO-tag protease SenP2 was added
to approx. 40 mg protein (1:20 mass ratio) in the pooled
Ni-IMAC fractions. The protein was dialyzed overnight
at 4
/C14 C against buffer C (20 mM NaPi, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4) to remove imidazole and then further purified
by reverse Ni-IMAC. Finally, the target protein was fur-
ther purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)
using a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 75 pg. column
attached to an ÄKTA pure™ (Cytiva) purification sys-
tem. SEC fractions were pooled, and the protein was
concentrated to 10 to 50 mg/mL. 25 to 50μL samples
were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at/C0 20
/C14 C
until further use.
4.10 | PET-degradation endpoint and
kinetic measurements in PET-coated well
plates and soluble product analysis
96-well plates (Thermo Scientific™ Nunc MicroWell™
flat bottom) were coated with a PET-film according to
Weigert et al. (
2021)5 0μL of an enzyme solution was
added per well, and the plates were sealed with a gas-
TURAK ET AL. 11 of 15

tight self-adhesive film. In general, plates with enzyme
solutions were incubated at the target temperature for
20 h. Subsequently, all samples were prepared and
analyzed via reverse-phase UHPLC as described in
Weigert et al. (
2021).
Kinetic analysis was performed with 70μL enzyme
solution per well. To analyze the total product releases
at specific time points, 50μL solution was transferred to
a non-coated 96-well plate. This plate was then trans-
ferred to/C0 20
/C14 C to quench the reaction. Reverse-phase
UHPLC analysis was performed as before.
4.11 | pNPB-activity measurement for
thermostability assessment of
HaloPETase1
500 nM of HaloPETase1 were incubated in 1 mL
20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, with 1, 3, or 5 M NaCl concentra-
tion at 50, 60, or 68/C14 C for up to 72 h. 10μL samples
were taken after 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h from each salt
and temperature condition and diluted with 980 μL
20 mM NaPi pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl in a UV-
transmissible plastic cuvette. To begin the hydrolytic
reaction, 10 μL of a 100 mM pNPB in DMSO were
transferred to the enzyme solution in the cuvette. The
reaction was mixed by inversion, and kinetic absor-
bance measurement was performed at 405 nm immedi-
ately after mixing. The residual activity was determined
by normalizing the initial rates with the one at 0 h
incubation.
4.12 | Heterologous expression and
purification ofHaloPETases2 to 6
The genes ofHaloPETases2 to 6 were analyzed with
SignalP 6.0 (Teufel et al.,2022) to identify and remove
the N-terminal signal peptide. Genes were codon-
optimized for production in E. coli Shuffle
® T7 cells
(NEB) and cloned into the pET21b-vector. Pre-cultures
were prepared as before. The expression was then
induced by the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG (final concen-
tration) and cultures were left overnight at 16 or 20
/C14 C
with 140 rpm shaking. Cells were harvested, and pel-
lets were washed with 30 mL PBS.
Cells were thawed on ice, resuspended with 30 mL of
buffer A, and subsequently lysed via ultrasonication.
Crude cell lysates were centrifuged to separate cell debris
from soluble protein at 4
/C14 C, 18,000 rpm for 1 h. The
cleared lysates (supernatants) were transferred into a
fresh vessel and stored on ice. Ni-NTA and SEC purifica-
tion steps were performed for all proteins. If insufficient
purity was observed by SDS-PAGE, ion-exchange chro-
matography was performed as a final step.
If so, fractions from the SEC were pooled and concen-
trated to dilute the NaCl concentration 20-fold from 150 to
theoretically 7.5 mM with buffer D (20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4).
Cation- and anion-exchange chromatography was per-
formed with a 1 mL HiTrap
® SP FF or 1 mL HiTrap® Q
FF column, respectively. The elution was performed by a
linear gradient from 0 to 25% of buffer E (20 mM NaPi,
2 M NaCl, pH 7.4) over 20 CV. The peak fractions were
pooled, concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen.
4.13 | Site-directed mutagenesis of
HaloPETase1
Single mutations were introduced inHaloPETase1 at
position T88 to re-establish theπ-stacking clamp and at
position Q157 to re-introduce the canonical methionine
in the lipase-box motif using site-directed mutagenesis.
See Table
S5 for primer pairs and sequences.
Sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing.
4.14 | Bioinformatic mining for putative
PETases inHalopseudomonas
A search was conducted against the proteome ofHalop-
seudomonas. For this, 40 genomes were retrieved from
NCBI (for accession numbers see Table S4). Open
reading frames of theHalopseudomonas genomes were
predicted with Prodigal version 2.6.3 (Hyatt et al.,2010).
A hidden Markov model profile from biochemically char-
acterized PETases from the PAZy database (Buchholz
et al.,
2022) was generated with HMMER version 3.1b1
(Eddy, 1998) using thehmmbuild option, and a search
against theHalopseudomonas proteome was performed
using HMMER 3.1b1 with thehmmsearch option and a
bitscore threshold of 100.
4.15 | Three-dimensional structure
determination
HaloPETase1 in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5
was set to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Sitting-
drop vapor-diffusion methodology was used with JCSG
Core I-III and PEGs II (Qiagen) for screening crystalli-
zation conditions in 96 well Intelli plates (Art Robbins)
stored at 20
/C14 C in Rock Imager RI 182 (Formulatrix).
Volume ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 were prepared using
a Phoenix robot dispenser (Art Robbins Instruments)
with a total drop volume of 0.8μL. Crystal formation
was observed in the following condition: 1:1 ratio, 0.1 M
imidazole, 40% (v/v) PEG 400. For cryoprotection, 25%
(v/v) glycerol was added to the crystals before flash-
freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were col-
lected at the German Electron Synchroton (DESY)
beamline P13 (Cianci et al.,
2017) operated by the
Helmholtz association using a wavelength of 0.97 Å
and a PILATUS detector.
12 of 15 TURAK ET AL.

Diffraction data were processed with X-ray Detector
Software (XDS) using XDSAPP 3.1.5 (Krug et al.,
2012). The structure was solved by molecular replace-
ment with PHASER in the PHENIX (Adams et al.,
2010) software suite v.1.21 using a ColabFold (Mirdita
et al., 2022) model of HaloPETase1. The refinement
was performed with phenix.refine. The model was
improved by electron density map inspection and itera-
tive manual rebuilding performed in Coot v.0.9 (Emsley
et al.,
2010). The 3D-structure and structure factors
were deposited in the PDB (Berman,2000) with acces-
sion code 9hl5. All structural representations and
graphical manipulations were performed in PyMOL
3.0.0 (Schrodinger, LLC) (Schrödinger, LLC,2024).
4.16 | Sequence and structure analysis
of HaloPETases
Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were performed
using ProbCons (Do et al., 2005) with full-length
sequences. Alignment of Pseudomonas mendocina
cutinase ( PmC) was performed with the protein
sequence retrieved from UniProtKB (The UniProt
Consortium,
2023) (entry: A4Y035). Sequence homol-
ogy analysis ofHaloPETases and reference PETases
such as leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC, Uni-
ProtKB entry: G9BY57) and Ideonella sakaiensis
PETase (IsPETase, UniProtKB entry: A0K8P6T7) was
performed by creating a MSA with ProbCons and using
the ClustalX 2.1 (Larkin et al.,
2007) software suite to
generate a neighborhood-join tree with 1000 bootstrap.
The tree was illustrated using the website tool Interac-
tive Tree of Life (iTOL,
https://itol.embl.de/). To plot the
amino-acid frequencies from the MSA as a logo plot,
the python library LogoMaker was employed (https://
github.com/jbkinney/logomaker).
The 3D structures of putative and experimentally char-
acterized HaloPETases were modeled with ColabFold
(Mirdita et al.,2022); only rank 1 structures were consid-
ered for further analyses. Structural alignments were gen-
erated in PyMOL with the sequence-independentalign
algorithm (default settings; 2 Å cut-off and 5 refinement
cycles) implemented in the software. In all cases, the
alignment was done globally and with all backbone Cα
atoms, except the first 40 Cα to exclude the N-terminal
signal peptides.
4.17 | Preparation of PET-films
Polymer films were prepared using a 25-12-2HC hot
press (Carver) with a 130/C2 130 /C2 0.1 mm mold. The
required amount of polymer (fiber grade PET granules
RT3050, Indorma Ventures) was placed in the mold,
which was then sandwiched between stainless-steel
plates coated with Nowoflon Perfluoralkoxy (PFA) foil.
The material was heated to 270
/C14 C for 3 min and
pressed at 5 tons for 1 min. Afterwards, the PET films,
along with the mold, were rapidly quenched in ice water
immediately after removal from the hot press. The crys-
tallinity of the films was determined using DSC.
4.18 | Differential scanning calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
were conducted using a Netzsch 204 F1 Phoenix
instrument. Approximately 5–7 mg of the sample was
placed in an aluminum crucible with a pierced lid. The
analysis was performed over a temperature range of
0 to 300
/C14 C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Flow: 20 mL/
min). Data analysis was carried out using the Proteus
Analysis 8.0 software.
The percentage crystallinity of the polymer was
determined using DSC by calculating the ratio of the
enthalpy of fusion of the polymer sample subtracted by
the enthalpy of crystallization to the enthalpy of fusion
of the polymer at 100% crystallinity, as shown in the fol-
lowing equation:
%Crystallinity ¼ð ðΔH
f ;sample /C0 ΔHc;sampleÞ=ΔHf ;100%Þ
/C2 100
where ΔHf ,sample is the enthalpy of fusion of the sample,
ΔHc,sample is the enthalpy of crystallization obtained
from the 1st heating curve of the DSC plot.ΔHf ,100%
represents the enthalpy of fusion of the fully crystalline
polymer. The ΔHf ,100% was taken as 140 J/g (Zhu,
2002). Using the above equation the crystallinity of the
PET films was calculated to be/C24 14%.
4.19 | Scanning electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed
on an FEI Quanta FEG 250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
equipped with an ET detector. To prepare the samples
for imaging, a 2.0 nm platinum coating was applied
using a Cressington 208HR Platinum Sputter Coater,
with the coating thickness monitored by an MTM20
thickness monitor.
