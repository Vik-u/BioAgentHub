Abstract
Recently, a bacterium strain ofIdeonella sakaiensiswas identified with the uncommon
ability to degrade the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The PETase from
I. sakaiensis strain 201-F6 (IsPETase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of PET converting it to
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET),
and terephthalic acid (TPA). Despite the potential of this enzyme for mitigation or
elimination of environmental contaminants, one of the limitations of the use of
IsPETase for PET degradation is the fact that it acts only at moderate temperature
due to its low thermal stability. Besides, molecular details of the main interactions of
PET in the active site ofIsPETase remain unclear. Herein, molecular docking and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to analyze structural changes of
IsPETase induced by PET binding. Results from the essential dynamics revealed that
the β1-β2 connecting loop is very flexible. This loop is located far from the active site
of IsPETase and we suggest that it can be considered for mutagenesis to increase the
thermal stability ofIsPETase. The free energy landscape (FEL) demonstrates that the
main change in the transition between the unbound to the bound state is associated
with theβ7-α5 connecting loop, where the catalytic residue Asp206 is located. Over-
all, the present study provides insights into the molecular binding mechanism of PET
into theIsPETase structure and a computational strategy for mapping flexible regions
of this enzyme, which can be useful for the engineering of more efficient enzymes
for recycling plastic polymers using biological systems.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Synthetic polymers, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) revolu-
tionized modern human civilization due to their versatile applications
and low-cost production. However, due to the ultralong lifetimes of
most PET-based plastic waste and the high resistance to
biodegradation,
1,2 these synthetic polymers remain one of the most
challenging environmental problems with serious impacts on ecosys-
tems and biodiversity.
3-5
Ideonella sakaiensis strain 201-F6 was recently discovered with
the unusual ability to degrade and use synthetic polymers, such as
PET, as its major energy and carbon source.
6 This discovery opened
up new scientific researches to find a solution for plastic waste using
environmentally friendly alternatives based on enzymatic recycling in
mesophilic temperatures.7-10
Yoshida group demonstrated thatI. sakaiensisexpress two closely
related enzymes involved with PET degradation.6,11 The first enzyme
is named PETase (PET hydrolase), which converts PET to mono
(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA
(BHET), and terephthalic acid (TPA) as products. The second enzyme
is the MHETase (MHET hydrolase) that further converts MHET into
two monomers: ethylene glycol (EG) and TPA.
12 Structural and evolu-
tionary studies ofI. sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) have shown that its
structure resembles that of α/β-hydrolase enzymes. 13 The α/-
β-hydrolase family includes lipases and cutinases, which catalyze the
hydrolysis of fatty acids and cutin, respectively.13-15
The PET-hydrolyzing enzymes were reported to be expressed in
several organisms including fungi16-19 and bacteria20-22 that usually
inhabit environments containing plastic debris or organic matters.
However, although several structures of these enzymes have been
reported recently, only a few of them are complexed with the PET
polymer or its analogs.
13,22-26 Thus, the PET-binding mode has been
predicted mostly through computational methods.22,27
The IsPETase binding site is larger when compared with thermo-
stable cutinases, and also contains large hydrophobic residues, such as
Trp156, important for substrate stabilization.13,28 Additionally, the
PETase backbone does not show high conformational changes when
bound to PET and the movements have been described as limited to
the binding subsite.
14,28
Several studies have proposed a molecular mechanism for enzymatic
catalysis.14,28,29The conserved catalytic triad Ser160, Asp206, and His237
is present in the active site of theIsPETase13,14 and shares the same spa-
tial orientation ofα/β hydrolases enzymes. Figure 1 shows theIsPETase
secondary and tertiary structures (PDB code: 6EQE), with its typicalα/-
β-hydrolase fold containing two disulfide bonds (Cys203-Cys239 and
Cys273-Cys289), which guarantee an extra rigidity to the protein struc-
ture, and 7α-helices (α.1-α.7), 9β-sheets (β.1-β.9), and 14 loops.
In the active site, a disulfide bond between the residues Cys176
and Cys212 is related to thermal stability.15 Moreover, the reduction
of these cysteines results in a dramatic increase in the structural flexi-
bility of the active site, thus destabilizing the integrity of the catalytic
triad, which leads, consequently, to a decrease of the enzymatic

activity.15 Despite its remarkable activity in the hydrolysis of PET
polymers, the wild-type structure of theIsPETase is not optimized for
full degradation of PET, and details of the catalytic mechanism of this
reaction remain unknown.24
One of the limitations of the use of PETase for PET degradation
is the fact that it acts only at mild temperatures due to its low thermal
stability. Indeed, the PET hydrolysis inI. sakaiensis was observed ini-
tially at 30/C14 C.6 Nevertheless, IsPETase exhibits poor durability, where
most of its activity is lost within 24 hours of incubation at 37/C14 C.9 In
addition, due to the inertness of PET at this temperature as a result of
its intrinsic polymer properties, biocatalytic recycling at low reaction
temperatures is unlikely to be feasible.
30 It is important to emphasize
that protein flexibility is critical for enzymatic activity. Therefore, it is
expected that the protein engineering should focus on mutagenesis
residues far from the active site of this enzyme to increase the
thermostabilization without causing impact in the flexible key regions
of the protein that are critical for the hydrolysis of PET. Recently, Son
et al have remarkably enhanced the thermal stability and improved
the PET degradation ability ofIsPETase.
9 They have used the B-factor
value as a parameter to map flexible regions of the protein far from
the active site. Then, they explored some point mutations to increase
the stability of the protein structure. The authors found that the
β6-β7 connecting loop was a flexible region based on B-factor value
and it was used as a target region of the protein for mutation.
9 Indeed,
point mutations have been used for stabilizing protein structure and
some substitutions were proposed in flexible regions of the protein.
31
Recently, Cui et al, have successfully redesignIsPETase to improve its
robustness using a systematic clustering analysis combined with the
greedy accumulation of beneficial mutations in a computationally
derived library.
32 Therefore, the thermal stability of PETase may be
crucial for effective PET degradation and may provide biocatalysts as
candidates for industrial PET recycling processes. In this work, we
have examined in detail the protein conformational changes and resi-
due fluctuations using essential dynamics to suggest potential target
regions of IsPETase for mutagenesis. Currently, the binding mode of
PET into the IsPETase subsites was not elucidated through experi-
mental techniques due to difficulties in co-crystallization and low sol-
ubility of the entire polymer.
13,14 In this sense, we have explored the
binding mode of PET into theIsPETase subsites using computational
approaches and we also compared with previous molecular docking
analyses.13,15,24 Our computational results could shed light on further
studies that aim to engineer its structure, to determine and improve
its activity for the recycling of plastic polymers using biological
systems.
2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 | Molecular docking
Considering that the binding mode of PET in theIsPETase structure
was not previously elucidated using experimental methods, we per-
formed molecular docking of an oligomer consisting of four monomers
in their low free-energy conformations to analyze the selectivity and
affinity of the polymer during the initial stages of the PETase catalytic
process. Considering the wild-type structure ofI. sakaiensis PETase
(PDB: 6EQE, X-ray diffraction with 0.92 Å resolution) was the first
reported mesophilic enzyme with affinity and catalytic activity against
the PET,
24 we choose this structure with high resolution as a target to
perform a detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions established
between the protein and the PET.
To perform the molecular docking against theIsPETase binding
subsites, we used the AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2)33 program with
the following forms mimicking PET: monomer (bis-[hydroxyethyl] tere-
phthalate, BHET), dimer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-hydroxyethyl tere-
phthalate)
2, 2-HE(MHET) 2), and tetramer (2-hydroxyethyl-(mono-
hydroxyethyl terephthalate)4, 2-HE(MHET)2).13 Conjecturing that the
conformation of the PET tetramer in theIsPETase corresponds to that
of individual monomers bound atIsPETase subsites I to IV, we sequen-
tially constructed three models of PET: Model I comprises the individual
PET monomers against four proposed binding subsites of PETase. In
Model II, we combined two PET monomers, thus forming a dimer to
dock against two adjacentIsPETase binding subsites. In Model III, we
joined the four PET monomers forming a tetramer to dock against four
potential adjacent PETase binding subsites (subsites I to IV). Table S1
shows the parameters used in the docking of the three models of PET.
The molecular docking in the AutoDock Vina was performed con-
sidering the flexibility of the residues from the subsites (Tyr87,
Trp159, Ser160, Met161, Ile208, Asn233, His 237, Ser238, Asn241,
and Arg280), as well as the flexibility of the ligand. The following Car-
tesian coordinates of the center of the docking grid, in Å, were
applied: X = /C0 0.51, Y = 4.23, and Z = 20.09; with dimensions of
x = 70, y = 56, andz = 68 for PET flexible docking.
Further validation was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker
(MVD)
34 and CSD-GOLD35; then compared with the conformations
obtained by the AutoDock Vina (available in Tables S1 and S3). After
analysis and validation, the top-predicted pose of theIsPETase-PET
complex obtained from AutoDock Vina was used as the starting point
for the MD simulations.
2.2 | Molecular dynamics simulations
To evaluate the conformational dynamics of theIsPETase, we performed
MD simulations in the Amber16 package36 with structures derived from
the docking study. The structure ofIsPETase has two disulfide bonds
(203-239 and 273-289) that play an important role in maintaining and
stabilizing the protein structure. We performed MD simulations for two
IsPETase systems: IsPETase in the unbound state (system I); and
IsPETase in complex with PET tetramer (2-HE(MHET)
4) (system II). The
simulation of polymers may be particularly difficult.37,38 Therefore, to
obtain a satisfactory sampling of the PETase in the bound state, we
applied restraint forces. This approach has been useful to identify domain
motions especially for those of computational challenging systems.39,40
First, the protein residues were parameterized with the ff99SB
force field.41 The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) protocol

was used to calculate the charges of PET tetramer using the Gauss-
ian09 program42 with the Hartree-Fock method and the 6-31G* base
set according to Amber protocol. The charges were then obtained
using the antechamber module available in the Amber16 package. To
describe PET structure complexed with IsPETase, the ligand was
parameterized with the general Amber force field and the receptor
(IsPETase enzyme) was parameterized with Amber ff99SB forcefield.
Both systems were solvated in an octahedral periodic box of 12 Å
side, with the TIP3P water solvation model.
43 The systems were neu-
tralized with Cl/C0 ions to avoid unbalanced charges. The resulting sys-
tems were solvated with TIP3P water, where it was applied
octahedral periodic boundary conditions. All stages simulations
employed a nonbonded cutoff of 8 Å, where particle mesh Ewald
(PME) approach computed the long-range Coulomb forces.
Prior to the MD simulation, the water molecules, ions,IsPETase
structure were minimized with seven steps with 10 000 cycles of
steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithm to avoid clashes or
improper geometries. We started the minimization with a constraint
force equal to 500 kcal/mol/Å
2 applied in the cartesian coordinates,
which was gradually decreased during minimization to relax the
waters, counterions, protein, and ligand structure. Afterward, the sys-
tems were heated in 10 steps from 0 to 300 K. The first heating step
was maintained at constant volume during 20 ps (0 to 100 K), from
the second to the ninth step the temperature was gradually increased
from 25 to 25 K until reaching 275 K with each step performed in a
time of 1 ns for each step, and in the 10th step (last heating step) the
system reached the temperature of 300 K. Then, we performed 5 ns
of MD simulation to balance the density of the system and maintain a
constant pressure (1 bar) and temperature (300 K). Here, we
maintained the PET tetramer interacting with theIsPETase binding
sites (I to IV) using a restraint force of 150 kcal/mol/Å
2 on the Carte-
sian coordinates of PET obtained from molecular docking. The SHAKE
algorithm was applied for all hydrogen bonds in the analyzed systems.
It is worth noting that restraint forces in the ligand structures in com-
plex with the molecular receptor are widely applied to allow the con-
formational adaptation of the receptor structure to the ligands, thus,
establishing favorable intermolecular interaction.
44,45 It is important
to highlight that the restraints force also increases the conformational
stability of the complex throughout the MD simulation, avoiding the
loss of the interaction between the investigated structures, and misin-
terpretation of the binding free energy values.
46,47
In the production stage of the unbound and bound systems (sys-
tems I and II, respectively), we performed 500 ns of MD simulations
for each system using the NPT ensemble, and each system was repli-
cated and assigned with different initial velocities to generate inde-
pendent simulations.
2.3 | Principal component analysis and free energy
landscape
The principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that allows to
reduce the dimensions of the analyzed trajectories during the MD
simulation of the covariance matrix (C), thus reducing the linear corre-
lations between the spatial coordinates and converting them into a
set of an orthogonal vector named principal component (PC) which
describes the movements using the Cartesian coordinatesX, Y, and
Z of each analyzed atom.
48 This technique has been widely combined
with MD simulations to evaluate the conformational changes of pro-
tein structures.40,49-55 Here, the CPPTRAJ module available in the
Amber16 package was used to obtain the trajectories ofIsPETase
structures using the Cα coordinates over the 500 ns of MDs to gener-
ate the principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3). The principal com-
ponents that represent the protein movement are described
according to Equation (1)

throughout the used eigenvectors, which describe the collective
movement of protein
56-58; and the diagonalization generates a
reduced matrix with PC1, PC2, and PC3 for each frame obtained in
MD simulation.
In the present study, we used the Bio3D package59 to perform
the PCA. Herein, the PCs were obtained from the diagonalization of
the covariance matrix obtained from the Cartesian coordinates of the
superposed Cα atoms of IsPETase structure. To avoid an underesti-
mate of the atomic displacement, an iterated superposition procedure
was applied before the PCA, where residues displaying the largest
positional differences were excluded at each round until only the
invariant “core” residues remained.

probability distribution obtained from the MD trajectories,kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature,ρmax is the probability of
maximum value subtracted from the free energy value, contained in
the most significant conformation, to approximate it to zero.60,61 To
explore the conformations that are close to the native structure, the
FEL values represented in two-dimensional were obtained from both
probability distributions of PC1 and PC2 for all analyzed systems. To
obtain the FEL plot and the conformational states of the PETase
structure in the minimum of the energy landscape, we used the
CPPTRAJ module of the Amber16 package. It is important to note
that PCs were used to recognize the main structures that compose
the first movement (PC1) and the second movement (PC2). We only
considered the atomic coordinates of the bound and unbound states
of theIsPETase structure to obtain the PCA plots to ensure the same
amount of the analyzed atoms.
3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the present study, molecular docking and MD simulations were
employed to provide information on the structural conformations and
movements ofIsPETase induced by PET binding, as well as the selec-
tivity and affinity of the substrate complexed with theIsPETase bind-
ing subsites.
Figure 2 shows the molecular docking obtained using the confor-
mational search strategy of the monomers in the fourIsPETase sub-
sites based on previous studies,
12,23 as described in the methods
section. Our docking analysis demonstrated that the carbonyl oxygen
of the PET ester group is positioned close to the nitrogen of the back-
bone amide group of the oxyanion hole (Figure 2). Figure 2A shows
the binding mode of the four PET monomers analyzed separately,
where the positioning of the monomer 1 (MHET moiety) formedπ-π
interactions with the aromatic amino acid Trp185 at the subsite
(Figure S1), which were also observed previously observed by Han
et al.
14 The interaction distance between the Ser160 and the PET car-
bonyl is 5.88 Å. Panel B shows that the poses obtained for the dimers
1-2 and dimers 3-4 (Figure 2B) are similar to the individual monomers
complexed at their respective subsites.
It is important to highlight that our analysis of MD simulations of
the 500 ns of theIsPETase-PET complex revealed that the PET sub-
strate formed a stable complex at the binding site and the distance
between the Ser160-OG atom to the carbonyl group of the monomer
1 of PET showed an average distance of 5.88 Å over the MD simula-
tion. These results are supported by previous studies
24 and it can be
hypothesized that Ser160 could further approximate after its proton
transfer to the His237, which is required for the nucleophilic attack
on the carbonyl group.
The following interatomic distances of theIsPETase catalytic triad
were found: between the oxygen (OG) from Ser160 and the nitrogen
(NE2) from His237 was equal to 3.19 Å, and between the ND1 from
His237 and OD2 from Asp206 was equal to 2.75 Å. Also, the results
of the molecular docking showed intermolecular interactions via
hydrogen bond of PET monomer 1 to the Ser213 (distance of 2.98 Å),
monomer 4 to the Ser236 (distance of 2.07 Å), and Thr279 (distance
of 2.85 Å). Ala209 and Trp185 have interesting interactions with
monomer1, Ala209 showed aπ-alkyl interaction to the ring of mono-
mer1, while Trp185 showedπ- π interaction to the monomer1, show-
ing an important role in the polymer positioning at the binding site
during catalysis. The residues Ser214, Ile208, Pro210, Met161,
His237, Asn241, Ser238, Cys239, Asn244, Gly235, Asn246, Ile232,
Asn233, and Arg280 showed van der Waals interactions along with
the PET polymer. Some molecular interactions are shown in Figure S1.
The structure obtained from the molecular docking also showed a
similar binding mode to the PETase crystallographic structure in com-
plex with MHET (PDB ID: 5XH3).
14 Thus, indicating a satisfactory
docking result for the subsite I. Detailed comparison between thepose
obtained from the molecular docking and the BHET binding mode in
the PETase crystallographic structure is shown in Figure S2.
Figure 3 shows the electrostatic potential map of the crystallo-
graphic structure24 used as a start point for the molecular docking
simulation, where the highlighted region indicates the PET binding
cavity (Figure 3A). The main residues for each subsite obtained by our
docking results are shown in Figure 3B. TheIsPETase subsites I-IV are
proposed to accommodate four MHET moieties of the PET in an L-
shape (Figure 3B,C). The complex was stabilized mainly by hydropho-
bic interactions. Hydrogen bond interactions with Ser236 and Asn246
were observed at the ester linkages between the MHET moieties. The
residue Arg280 also participated in the interaction at subsite IV
(Figure 3C), although it is demonstrated that its absence showed much
greater PET degradation activity.
14 Intermolecular distances between
the atoms of the catalytic pocket and PET structure obtained from the
molecular docking could be seen in Table S4.
The obtained binding modes (Figure 2C) demonstrated that the
PET tends to fill the same spatial regions of the subsites as a mono-
mer, dimer, or tetramer. Therefore, ourIsPETase-PET complex repre-
sents a consistent and reliable model with favorable binding energies.
The pocket mapping was compared with the docking results obtained
from MVD
34 and GOLD35 programs to validate our conformational
search (see more in Table S2).
Previously, Fecker et al demonstrated thatIsPETase has a binding
mode similar to other PET-degrading cutinases, such as Cut2 obtained
from Thermobifida fusca KW3 (TfCut2) and leaf-branch compost
cutinase (LCC) obtained from a metagenomic survey.
15 These authors
explored the cutinases-PET complexes focusing only on the active site
that contains the catalytic triad formed by the residues Asp179,
His210, and Ser133.
15 The comparison between IsPETase and
cutinases TfCut2 and LCC demonstrated that the catalytic triad is con-
served, showing the same spatial orientation in the three structures.
Interestingly, the residues Asp179 and His210; and Ser133 and
His210 formed hydrogen bond interactions in the active site. Our
docking and MD simulations also demonstrated a very similar spatial
orientation for these residues (Asp206, His237, and Ser160,
respectively).
In contrast, Joo et al, investigated the interaction of four-MHET
molecules mimicking the PET structure against fourIsPETase binding
pockets named subsite I, IIa, IIb, and IIc.

findings, theπ-π interactions between Trp185 and the benzene ring of
the first MHET moiety (/C24 3.6 Å, subsite I) contribute greatly to the
overall stabilization of the PET in the binding pocket. It was also dem-
onstrated that Arg280 at the end of subsite IIc, due to its protruding
shape, hinders stable interaction of IsPETase with PET substrate
beyond the fourth moiety, and its substitution into a small hydropho-
bic residue might allow more stable binding for a longer substrate.
Similarly, Austin et al used docking simulations to predict the PET
binding mode in theIsPETase and demonstrated that PET formed an
interaction with the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Ser160 (/C24 5.1 Å)
and the His237 is positioned within 3.9 Å of the Ser160 hydroxyl.

The interatomic distances obtained from our simulations are consis-
tent with this previous proposal and also with the previous results
reported by Fecker et al and Joo et al.
3.1 | Analysis of molecular dynamics ofIsPETase
Our model of the IsPETase-PET complex started with a consistent
binding mode as previously proposed in docking studies.13,24 In the
present study, we used MD simulations to explore the conformational
change of IsPETase upon PET binding. The RMSD plots of the
IsPETase structure in the unbound and bound states are shown in
Figure S3. Our MD simulations protocol successfully sampled the
difficult-to-access configurations of theIsPETase structure in complex
with PET, showing high stability during the MD simulation, with devia-
tions below 3.0 Å (Figure S3A). In general, theIsPETase in both bound
and unbound states showed no significant atomic RMSD deviation
over the MD trajectory, exhibiting RMSD values of 1.93 ± 0.43 Å and
1.56 ± 0.35 Å, respectively (Figure S3B and Table S5). Thus, further
analysis to better describes the differences between the unbound and
bound systems was carried out using more detailed analysis.
The analysis of the binding mode of PET complexed with PETase
showed that the Trp159 from the subsite II formed aπ-π stacking
interaction with the aromatic ring from the MHET moiety (see
Figure S1). Furthermore, the Ile209 formed aπ-alkyl interaction with
the same structural moiety of PET located at the subsite II. Regarding
subsite I, we noted that residue Trp186 (NE1) formed H-bond interac-
tions with the oxygen atoms of the MHET moiety (O11, O13, and
O14). We conjecture that these interactions are responsible to main-
tain the PET in subsite I and II over the MD trajectory. Differently, the
subsites III and IV, the structural moieties of PET formed numerous
hydrophobic contacts that weakly maintain the PET structure in the
pocket. Thus, its structure suffers considerable conformational

changes that lead to its departure from the cavity. Figure S4 shows an
overview of each MHET moieties (hexagons) complexed at their
respective binding subsite during MD simulations.
Monomer 2 showed the most stable interactions in the elected
binding subsites (system II, Figure S4). In contrast, the monomers
located at the ends of the PET polymer (monomers 1 and 4) showed
higher mobility. The RMSD plot also showed that the use of a
restraint force to maintain the PET in the binding subsite allowed pro-
tein adjustments for a better fit during the first frames of the MD tra-
jectory. When the restraint force was reduced, the PET conformation
was gradually adjusted and remained in the subsite until the end of
the 500 ns of simulation.
We also analyzed the root-mean-square fluctuation (RSMF) for
individual amino acid residue over the 500 ns of MD simulation. This
analysis was used as a criterion for quantifying the flexibility of
IsPETase, where higher RMSF values correspond to more flexible
regions of the protein during MD simulation. The RMSF shows that
the catalytic residues Asp206 and His237 located atβ7-α5 andβ8-α6
connecting loop, respectively, presented considerable mobility during
MD simulations. It is interesting to note that previously, Fecker et al
analyzed the conformational changes ofIsPETase over time, as well as
the interactions of PET at the subsites; and they found that theβ7-α5
loop (loop10) flexibility was larger in IsPETase than in its close
cutinase homologs.

3.2 | Essential dynamics ofIsPETase
The use ofIsPETase for PET degradation is limited due to its low ther-
mal stability. Thus, we have used essential dynamics to identify the
flexible regions in the protein structure. These flexible regions in the
IsPETase can be used as a potential target for enhancing thermal sta-
bility. Besides, this analysis can also provide insight into the induced-
substrate conformational change inIsPETase. Herein, we performed a
PCA for the two analyzed systems: (a) PETase in the unbound state
(ligand-free), and (b)IsPETase in the bound state.
Corroborating with PCA results, the residue Trp185 showed a
considerable fluctuation between unbound and bound states
(Figure 4). Curiously, the characteristic of the conformational move-
ments of the Trp185 is directly related to the accessibility of the PET
polymer since its fluctuation modifies the cavity and adjusts the
monomer 1 accommodation at the binding site. Also, the movement
of Trp185 possibly controls the subsite entrance of a new PET mono-
mer in the binding subsite, thus leading to continuous depolymeriza-
tion.
24 Moreover, during the MD simulation, the Trp185 showed
different conformations that increase the cavity volume of the mono-
mer 1 to accommodate the polymer (Figures S5 and S6), as previously
observed.
24
These variations indicate that the protein alters its conformation
to receive the substrate. It also indicates that Trp185 is involved in
the permanence of the PET monomer in the first binding subsite of
the enzyme as previously proposed.14 In the bound state (Figure S7),
the Trp185 residue position, as well as all the catalytic residues of the
protein, remained stable. This behavior could be associated with
the catalytic residues exerting significant interactions with the ligand.
However, the permanence of PET in the binding subsite may
impose local structure fluctuation, particularly, on the residue Trp185.
This behavior was also observed for Ser160, the main catalytic resi-
due. Moreover, the interaction of PET tetramer in the binding subsite
causes a displacement of the residue Asp206 located at theβ7-α5
connecting loop. Conformational changes can play a crucial role in
regulating the PET binding to the hydrophobic subsites and in the
control of the catalysis. We noticed in the PCA analysis that the resi-
dues Asp206 and Trp185 are very flexible. The results also show con-
siderable fluctuations in the residue His237 atβ8-α6 connecting loop.
Then, we conjecture that these residues are key residues for the
mechanism of binding and release of PET.
PCA result also shows that the most flexible region of the protein
is located atβ1-β2 connecting loops for both systemsIsPETase in the
unbound and the bound states (Figure 4). It is worth noting that these
essential dynamics involve almost 37.8% and 25.6% of the motion of
the unbound and in the bound systems, respectively (see
Appendix S1). The results also reveal that participation in the confor-
mational flexibility of β7-α5 and β1-β2 connecting loop is higher in
IsPET-PETase complex than inIsPETase without ligand. Therefore, we
suggest that theβ1-β2 connecting loop may be targeted for mutagen-
esis to increase theIsPETase stability since it is located far from the
active site.
Initially, we started the MD simulation assuming the PET L-shape
as the most probable conformation for theIsPETase-PET complex, as
previously suggested in other studies.
13,24 However, Wei et al indi-
cated that the amorphous PET is highly stiff and its binding into the

four IsPETase subsites is unlikely.62 To assess the existence of differ-
ent conformations acquired by PET over the MD simulation, we per-
formed a clustering analysis in the Cpptraj
63 program using as data set
the spatial coordinates calculated through the RMSD values to inves-
tigate the collective variable for the PET conformations sampled over
the 500 ns MD simulations. We obtained a hierarchical agglomerative
clustering with five clusters using as linkage the average-linkage.
64
The average values of the pseudoreplicates using F-statistic (pSF)64,65
and Davies-Bouldin indexes (DBI)64,66-68 were equal to 9072.386670
and 0.9566, respectively. The comparison between the planar (green)
and L-shape (cyan) conformations of PET structure analyzed over
500 ns of MD simulations is depicted in Figure S7. Our clustering ana-
lyses showed that the L-shape corresponds to approximately 1% of
the conformations acquired by PET and the planar shape corresponds
to the most common conformation with a frequency of approximately
97.2% (see Table S7), which is most correlated with the findings
reported by Wei et al.
3.3 | Free energy landscape analysis ofIsPETase
As commented in the Introduction section, experimental works have
suggested the PETase backbone does not present high conformational
changes upon PET binding, since its movement is limited to the bind-
ing subsite.
14,28 Indeed, our PCA results show that the main move-
ment of IsPETase is associated with β7-α5 and β1-β2 connecting
loops motion. Since PCA describes the largest amplitude protein
motions during a simulation, the bi-dimensional free energy landscape
(FEL) was obtained taking into consideration the bidimensional projec-
tions of PC1 versus PC2, which are considered the coordinates used
for obtaining the FEL. The FEL of IsPETase in the unbound state
showed that at the beginning of the MD, the conformations acquired
by theIsPETase structure were similar to those obtained at the end of
the simulation, thus demonstrating that conformational states of the
IsPETase were not altered dramatically over the MD trajectory, which
is in agreement with previous experimental data.
14,28 We also
observed for the analysis of the PCAPC2vsPC3 and PCAPC1vsPC3 plots, a
conformational dispersion at the end of MD simulation that not
formed isolated clusters. It is important to note that the conforma-
tions of the PC1 were not directly correlated with those found in
PC3, thus demonstrating that the initial conformations were grouped
separately from the other conformations that do not contain the PET
at the binding site (see Figure S9).
The main difference between the most stable structure of
IsPETase-PET complex (P1 in Figure 5) andIsPETase in the unbound
state (P4 in Figure 5) is in the β7-α5 connecting loop, where we
noted that the Asp206 opened the cavity of the active site. Other
conformational states with high probability were described for the
unbound state with P2 with a reduced cavity and P3 with an
opened cavity similar to that of P1 (Figure 5A). Considering that the
structural engineering ofIsPETase using site-direct mutagenesis has
led to optimized catalysis of PET,
13,25,69 finding the most stable
conformation of its structure is an important task for the
improvement of its active site selectivity and also to better under-
stand the conformational mechanism of the enzyme that influences
in the catalysis.
The IsPETase has large regions with polar surface charges with
few regions with acidic residues (red surfaces, Figure S10). In the sub-
site of monomer 1, more neutral regions are observed, while for the
other monomers regions high hydrophobic surfaces are detected.
There is an increase of the cavity's volumes (see Figure S6) of the sub-
sites when theIsPETase structure is complexed with the PET, demon-
strating conformational conservation of the catalytic triad. It is
important to point out that the wide cleft in the active site would be
necessary to accommodate semi-aromatic crystalline polyesters.
24
Recently, Knott et al studied the catalytic mechanism of the MHETase
enzyme converting MHET to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.70
The authors demonstrated that the main domain of MHETase is simi-
lar in the residue composition toIsPETase, which suggests insights
into the hydrolysis mechanism of PET performed by theIsPETase.70
However, the mobility of key residues and loops during the binding
and catalysis remains unclear. Our analyzes of FEL revealed an
increase in IsPETase stiffness upon binding of PET, which suggests
that binding of PET gives rise to an effective motion ofβ7-α5 con-
necting loop, which could have a direct influence on the PET binding
and catalysis. In particular, we suggest that the rearrangement of this
loop may be relevant for enabling the adoption of a proper conforma-
tion for PET recognition.
The comparison ofIsPETase states analyzed in the FEL plots (see
Figure 5 and Figure S11), revealed that the P1 (unbound) and P4
(bound) states demonstrate that the main conformational change in
the transition between the unbound state to the bound state is asso-
ciated withβ7-α5 connecting loop, which that exhibits movements of
the residue Asp206 (see Figure S11). In P1 (Figure 5, PETase free), this
residue interacts with His237 through hydrogen bond (1.78 Å) in
IsPETase in the unbound state. While the mobility of theβ6-β7 con-
necting loop is associated mainly with the residue Trp185, which has
a fluctuation in the change of states, while important catalytic resi-
dues, such as Trp159, Ser160, and His237 remain in stable conforma-
tions (see Figure 5C,D, and Figure S11).
Considering that the conformations located at the minima have
similarities to each other, we found that the conformations in P2 and
P3 of theIsPETase in the unbound state demonstrated a similar con-
formational change in the connectingβ7-α5 loop (loop 10) to accom-
modate the PET substrate (Figure S11A). The minimum conformations
of IsPETase located at the P5 and P6 showed the PET structure in
two conformations, that is, a planar and L-shape configuration,
respectively. The positions of His237 and Ser160 residues were also
maintained in both minima. However, it is important to note that the
Asp209 residue suffers the most conformational changes and
the Arg280 residue also showed a variation in its position due to the
alteration of PET configuration to planar to L-shape. Theπ-π interac-
tion between Trp185 and the ring of the first monomer was
maintained in both minima (Figure S11B). Interestingly, the connecting
β1-β2 loop (loop 3) variations were not observed for these minimum
conformations.

4 | CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated a consistent model for simulating the
IsPETase complexed with the PET, and its binding mode, which is in
agreement with the currently available information in the literature.
Our proposed model for PET binding mode can explain the conforma-
tional changes of protein structure and may be useful for the develop-
ment of new biocatalysts, as well as for the elucidation of the catalytic
mechanism of plastic recycling enzymes. The determination of the
binding mode of PET into the active site ofIsPETase is important for
understanding the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Our results
also revealed that theβ1-β2 connecting loop is very flexible and may
be targeted for mutagenesis to increase theIsPETase stability. Overall,
the results provide useful benchmarks for further engineering of
IsPETase structure aiming the recycling of plastic polymers using this
biological system.
