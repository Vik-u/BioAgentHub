ABSTRACT: The enzymatic depolymerization of poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) is emerging as a leading chemical recycling
technology for waste polyester. As part of this endeavor, new
candidate enzymes identified from natural diversity can serve as
useful starting points for enzyme evolution and engineering. In this
study, we improved upon HMM searches by applying an iterative
machine learning strategy to identify 400 putative PET-degrading
enzymes (PET hydrolases) from naturally occurring homologs.
Using high-throughput (HTP) experimental techniques, we
successfully expressed and purified >200 enzyme candidates and
assayed them for PET hydrolysis activity as a function of pH,
temperature, and substrate crystallinity. From this library, we
discovered 91 previously unknown PET hydrolases, 35 of which
retain activity at pH 4.5 on crystalline material, which are conditions relevant to developing more efficient commercial processes.
Notably, four enzymes showed equal to or higher activity than LCC-ICCG, a benchmark PET hydrolase, at this challenging
condition in our screening assay, and 11 of which have pH optima <7. Using these data, we identified regions of PETases statistically
correlated to activity at lower pH. We additionally investigated the effect of condition-specific activity data on trained machine
learning predictors and found a precision (putative hit rate) improvement of up to 30% compared to a Hidden Markov Model alone.
Our findings show that by pointing enzyme discovery toward conditions of interest with multiple rounds of experimental and
machine learning, we can discover large sets of active enzymes and explore factors associated with activity at those conditions.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, biocatalysis has emerged as a promising
recycling methodology for poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET), an abundantly produced plastic, due to its potential
to selectively depolymerize the polymer under mild con-
ditions.
1,2
A number of naturally occurring hydrolase enzymes
have been discovered that catalyze the conversion of PET to its
constituent monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG).
3−11
Most of these PET hydrolases exhibit
promiscuous activity related to their native functions as
cutinases, lipases, and carboxylesterases. In this study, we use
the term ″PET hydrolase″ to denote enzymes with
demonstrated PET hydrolytic activity, acknowledging that
the observed activity of these enzymes is very likely
promiscuous activity. At the time of writing, there are 127
PET hydrolases recorded in the PAZy database and on the
order of 250 total known enzymes to have PET depolymeriza-
tion activity.
12
Significant efforts have been dedicated to understand and
engineer these natural enzyme scaffolds to improve their
performance under industrially relevant conditions, especially
to operate at thermophilic temperatures (∼65−70 °C).
1,13,14
Mechanistic studies of structure and dynamics have revealed
key factors influencing enzyme performance, including active
site binding, flexibility, and the role of individual amino acids
in catalysis.
15−18
Sequence databases and metagenomes have
been mined and clustered for homologs, and ancestral
sequences “revived” to discover new PET hydrolase scaf-
folds.
9−11,19,20
For example, concurrently to this work, Seo et
al. developed a natural sequence cluster framework that groups
PET hydrolases by sequence similarity and systematically tests
representatives from high-performing clusters.

engineering campaigns successfully increased the thermal
stability and activity of PET hydrolases, achieving high
conversion extents on amorphous PET.
11,21−25
Despite these
advancements, the effectiveness of biocatalytic PET recycling
remains limited by several factors, including low depolymeriza-
tion extents for crystalline PET and the acidic conditions
generated by terephthalic acid release, requiring the addition of
base, significantly increasing the cost of the process.
1,14,26,27
Starting an engineering campaign from novel scaffolds with
activity profiles targeting relevant conditions may help address
these limitations.
In this study, we applied three consecutive rounds of
machine learning and high-throughput (HTP) experimental
characterization to discover PET-active hydrolases. In contrast
to an HMM search alone, or the clustering approach of Seo et
al., our work uses iterative, supervised machine learning
predictors trained on experimental data from the peer-reviewed
literature and from our assay to filter candidate sequences, with
a focus on challenging conditions including acid tolerance and
thermal tolerance. We used high-throughput experimental
techniques and an automated liquid handling robot to express
and purify over 200 enzymes and screen for activity across a
range of conditions, including temperature, pH, and substrate
crystallinity.
28
From this screening, we identified 91 novel (115
total) PET hydrolases with diverse activity profiles, including
some with pH optima <7, and with activity at or greater than
LCC-ICCG
21
at pH 4.5 on crystalline powder. Of the
candidates tested, we achieved a hit rate of 55% active PET
hydrolase and 22% with activity at pH 4.5. We used these data
to identify regions of the sequence and surface with potential
importance for low pH activity. We further demonstrate that
models trained on all three rounds of data have higher
predictive accuracy than those that use only literature data or
our first two rounds, suggesting that future rounds of enzyme
discovery may attain even higher hit rates. We expect that
these findings may serve as a foundation for future PET
hydrolase engineering efforts and enhance sequence mining
strategies for enzymes with activities tailored to specific
conditions.

METHODS
Homolog Identification and Candidate Selection. A
profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was constructed from a
multiple sequence alignment of 61 experimentally verified PET
hydrolases identified from PAZy (extracted Sept. 21, 2021).
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using
MAFFT.
12,29
The resulting profile HMM was used to search
against three sequence databases: NCBI nonredundant protein
database, JGI combined hotsprings metagenome database, and
MGnify.
30,31
HMM searches were performed using HMMER
(v3.2.1) with a bit score threshold of 100 for both the full
sequence score (-T 100) and domain score (−domT 100).
The same thresholds were applied to the inclusion thresholds
(−incT 100 and − incdomT 100). This initial search retrieved
10,633 putative PET hydrolase sequences.
32
For round two
and three, we used a pool of candidates from more sensitive
search using an HMM of 75 PAZy sequences (Mar. 7, 2023)
and a search bit threshold modified to 160, yielding 8067 hits.
HMMs are provided on Zenodo.
Candidate PET hydrolases were prioritized using a
combination of machine learning-based activity and property
predictors. In Round 1, a variational autoencoder (VAE) was
trained on aligned candidate sequences to learn a continuous
latent representation, followed by a supervised rank-based
predictor of PET hydrolase activity. In Rounds 2, PET
hydrolase activity was instead predicted using an ensemble
predictor, which showed better performance than the Round 1
model. See Zenodo for details. In Round 2 and 3, predicted
thermostability, PET hydrolase activity, and pH optimum were
used for multiobjective selection. All property predictors were
benchmarked using cross-validation. Candidate filtering
included sequence identity thresholds and clustering to ensure
novelty and diversity. Full methods for the models used in
selection in Round 1−3 are given in Supporting Information
Section S1.
Protein Expression and Purification. Selected genes
were codon optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized by
Twist Biosciences, and cloned into a pCDB179 expression
vector (Addgene #91960, gifted by Christopher Bahl)
containing an N-terminal 10xHis-SUMO fusion. Proteins
were expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) using autoinduction
media in 24-deep well plates. Expression, cell lysis, and nickel
affinity purification were carried out using an OT-2 robotic
platform as described previously.
28
SUMO tags were cleaved
using an in-house His-tagged SUMO protease. Protein
concentration was measured using a BCA assay and
normalized to 0.1 mg/mL for downstream applications. Full
expression and purification protocols are available in
Supporting Information Section S2.
Thermostability Measurement. Differential scanning
fluorimetry was performed on a Bio Rad CFX96 Touch
Real-Time PCR machine. 45 μL of enzyme solution (from 0 to
0.3 mg/mL after concentration normalization) was combined
with 5 μL of 5X Sypro Orange Dye (ThermoFisher Scientific
S6650) in a PCR plate (Bio-Rad HSP9601), which was then
sealed (ThermoFisher Scientific 4311971) and the following
program was used: 1. 25 °C: 0:15; 2. 25 °C: 0:31; 3. 25 °C:
0:15 (+0.3 °C/cycle, ramp 0.3 °C/s); 4. Plateread, 5. Go to 3,
250X.
Activity Assays. PET substrates, either amorphous film
(Goodfellow ES30-FM-000145) or crystalline powder (Good-
fellow ES30-PD-006031) were loaded into 96 deep-well plates
(NEST 503501) with 3.5 mg in each well. Amorphous film was
cut into 0.34 × 0.34 cm and loaded manually. Powder was
dispensed using the Powdernium Automated Powder Dosing
System (Symyx). 450 μL of buffer solution (prepared at room
temperature) was added. The buffers used were 50 mM
NaCitrate for pH 4.5 and 5.5 and 50 mM NaPhosphate for pH
6.5 and 7.5. The enzymes were reordered in a fresh plate and
normalized to 0.1 mg/mL if necessary. 50 μL of enzyme
solution (5 μg) was added to each well with blanks for each pH
containing just the buffer of the enzyme solutions. Aluminum
heat sealing foil (Azenta 4ti-0535) as well as autoclave tape
around the foil edges was used to prevent evaporation. Plates
were incubated at temperature (40 or 60 °C) for 48 h after
which they were cooled at room temperature for 30 min then
stored at −20 °C. The amount of aromatic product released
was evaluated by using absorbance at 260 and 280 nm on 100
μL aliquots of the reaction supernatant. Reactions containing
crystalline powder were filtered through MultiScreen
HTS
GV
Filter Plates (Millipore MSGVN2210) prior to analysis. The
calculation of product was performed as previously de-
scribed.

Crystallography. The purified protein was concentrated to
22 mg/mL and screened through approximately 600
crystallization conditions. The best crystals were obtained

from Morpheus screen well A1 (0.06 M Divalents, 0.1 M
Buffer System 1, 30% Precipitant Mix 1). Crystals were grown
by sitting drops vapor diffusion at 16 °C using a 1:1 ratio of
protein to well solution and grew in approximately 2 weeks.
Crystals were transferred to a well solution supplemented with
20% glycerol and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction
data was collected at the SSRL BL12−2 beamline using Dectris
PILATUS EIGER 2XE 16 M PAD detector. The crystals
belonged to space group P3

87.25 Å, 148.87 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°. There are two
monomers in the asymmetric unit. All data were processed
with XDS.
33
The structure was solved by molecular
replacement using Phaser
34
and by using a homology model
developed from a PETase (PDB code: 8ETY) as the search
models. Multiple rounds of manual model building using
Coot
35
and model building using the Buccaneer
36
program
were needed to successfully complete the model. The
structures were refined by using Refmac
37
and manually fitted
using the Coot program.
Sequence and Structure Analysis. The set of enzymes
that exhibited nonzero activity in our assay at any condition
were aligned with MUSCLE 5.1 with default parameters.
38
This alignment is provided on Zenodo. The same procedure
was used to align active training enzymes for HMMs. To
identify determinants of condition-specific activity, we
performed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses on
enzymes with measurable activity. Conservation of physico-
chemical residue categories was assessed across performance
groups using Jalview,
39
highlighting alignment columns
uniquely conserved under specific conditions (e.g., low pH).
Structural models were generated via ColabFold
40
(mean
pLDDT > 90) and aligned using mTM-align. Surface
properties�including electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and
stickiness�were computed with SURFMAP
41
and compared
between groups at each mapped surface location. Additionally,
predicted pK

values of titratable residues were analyzed using
PROPKA

Significance for surface properties an pK

was
assessed via Mann−Whitney U tests with p < 0.05. Sequence
positions prioritized by pretrained model attention (temBER-
Ture, EpHod) were also mapped to the alignment, though not
used in the analysis of significant factors presented here. A
mapping of all factors computed as mean differences between
groups and the values for individual candidates can be found in
Appendix B and C

Finally, we clustered additional
noncatalytic domains by pairwise similarity, identifying a
group of low-pH-active enzymes harboring a ricin B lectin-like
module. Full analysis methods, statistical tests, and structure
processing workflows are described in Supporting Information

splits is 94%, with a mean of means of 42%. Note that due to
differences in condition loading in our assay, some conditions
have fewer experimental evaluations per split. This allows us to
probe the effect of data size on trained models. Due to some
splits for some conditions having few or zero active enzymes,
we report scores over cross validated predictions as opposed to
cross validated scores, such that the whole data set for each
condition produces the score, however the model that made
each individual prediction did not see that example during
training. We tested HMMs with further training data by adding
enzymes with nonzero activity at a particular experimental
condition to an initial set of PET hydrolases and computing
the score for the same experimental condition. We compared
three starting points: HMM-17, HMM-61, and D1-Scraped-
513. Scores were normalized to each HMM’s score for LCC-
ICCG, to allow HMM scores across data splits to be
combined. Sequences of variable length were embedded by
the last layer of ESM3 open v1 and mean pooled and given to a
random forest of size 100, with default scikit-learn parameters
as of version 1.3.2.

The supervised models use HMM
scores as additional input features as in Hsu et al.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Putative Thermo- and Acid Tolerant PET Hydrolases
Identified Using Bioinformatics and Iterative Machine
Learning. We conducted a PET hydrolase homolog screen
consisting of three rounds (candidate ID per round: DP for
Round 1, TEP for Round 2, and ESM for Round 3, vide infra),
each augmented by machine learning on literature data or on
previous round data (Figure 1A). A summary of the PET
hydrolase data we used for this search is summarized in Table
1. Details for all models and parameters used for searching and
filtering candidates can be found in the Methods Section, while
an overview is given for each round below.
For Round 1 (Enzymes DP001-DP098, 94 total), we first
constructed a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM-61) using
61 experimentally verified PET hydrolases from the PAZy
database.
12
Database searches using this HMM against MGnify
and NCBI nonredundant (nr) database identified 10,633
candidate sequences, which were filtered to 8081 non-
redundant sequences.
30,31
We then developed a variational
autoencoder (VAE) using the selected sequences and trained a
supervised linear top model trained on the VAE latent space
using 513 sequences with experimental PET-hydrolase activity
from the literature (D1-Scraped-513). A summary of the works
that were scraped to produce this data set is given in Table S1.
With this approach, we selected 96 novel candidate sequences,
identified as the top predictions of the linear model, with less
than 90% identity to known PET hydrolases. We moved
forward with these sequences for expression and experimental
testing as described in the next section.
In Round 2 (Enzymes TEP001-TEP197, 191 total), we used
a larger HMM with new additions from PAZy (75 total) and
accepted more remote homologs in the search. We filtered
these homologs with three machine learning models trained to
predict PET hydrolysis activity, thermal stability, and acid
tolerance, respectively. For PET activity, we developed a new
model, an ensemble of supervised logistic regression and
unsupervised scores that outperformed the evolutionary VAE
from Round 1 in 5-fold cross-validation on the D-513 scraped
data set. Homologs were also scored by a thermal stability
predictor developed in house, trained on embedding outputs
from the protein language model ProtT5 and melting
temperatures from the Meltome Atlas, as well as for acid
tolerance by EpHod (Figure S1).
43,48
To ensure broad
exploration, candidates for Round 2 were selected as those
that maximized any individual score, or are above the 50th
percentile for all three, and have less than 90% identity to
known PET hydrolases and to each other.
In Round 3 (Enzymes ESM001-ESM191, 190 total), we
incorporated activity data from Round 1 and 2 to create
supervised models specifically trained to predict activity and
melting temperature from our assay. Several embedding
methods were tested, finding that ESM1v mean pool
embeddings performed best in cross validation (Spearman
correlation of 0.537 against max observed activity) with a ridge
regressor. Candidates were selected based on the absolute
value of predicted activity of 10 mM product/mg enzyme, > 55
°C predicted melting temperature, and sequence identity of
<95% to each other and previously reported PET hydrolases.
High-Throughput Experimentation Characterizes a
Diverse Set of Active PET Hydrolases. The selected genes
were commercially synthesized and cloned into the vector
pCDB179 with an N-terminal His-tag and small ubiquitin-like
modifier (SUMO) fusion to the target protein. The plasmids
were transformed into chemically competent E. coli and
expressed and purified using a HTP, semiautomated platform
described previously.
28
An Opentrons liquid handling robot
(OT-2) was used to facilitate the expression and purification in
multiwell plates (Figure 1B). Expression occurred in 2 mL
autoinduction cultures in 24-deep well plates. The cultures
were harvested and resuspended in a detergent-based lysis
buffer and purified via affinity chromatography using Ni-
charged magnetic beads. SUMO protease was added to cleave
the target proteins from the magnetic beads, yielding the
tagless protein into the supernatant. Purified protein
concentrations were evaluated using the bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) assay and wells containing sufficient yields were
normalized to 0.1 mg/mL via dilution. We observed the
threshold of detection above background to be 0.1 mg/mL
using the BCA assay, and we considered samples at or above
this threshold to be successfully purified. The purity of select

enzyme samples was assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate−
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS−PAGE) (Figure S2).
In total, 475 unique sequences were transformed, expressed,
and purified. Of these, 221 (47%) successfully purified and
achieved yields greater than or equal to a 0.1 mg/mL threshold
(Figure 1C). Those that yielded below threshold (254 total,
53%) may have failed due to poor expression, poor solubility,
or incomplete cleavage of the target protein from the magnetic
beads. The highest yield reached was approximately 600 μg
from a single well. The average yield of successfully purified
enzymes was 167 μg or an 84 mg/L titer.
The thermostability of the purified enzymes was determined
using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using Sypro
Orange as an unfolding indicator. Due to the high sensitivity of
DSF, which requires minimal protein and can measure melting
temperatures even below the concentration detection thresh-
old, all expressed enzymes were evaluated for thermostability
regardless of recorded yields. In total, 233 enzymes
demonstrated measurable melting temperatures (T
m
), with
observable T
m
values for some samples with concentrations
below 0.1 mg/mL (Figure 1D). The range of T
m
values
observed was 25.3−82.3 °C and the average T
m
for all samples
with measured values was 56.3 °C. A comparison of the
expression yield as a function of T
m
did not reveal a strong
correlation (Figure S3).
Successfully purified enzymes were carried forward to
determine their depolymerization activity on PET. Of the
221 successfully purified enzymes, 212 were tested for activity
with several being excluded due to insufficient volume to meet
the minimum number of test conditions. We loaded 96-deep
well plates with amorphous PET film (aFilm) or crystalline
PET powder (cryPow), both sourced commercially from
Goodfellow with reported crystallinities of 4.0 ± 2.0%, and
39.3 ± 2.0%, respectively.
9,49,50
Buffer was added for the pH
levels tested as follows: 4.5 (NaCitrate), 5.5 (NaCitrate), 6.5
(NaPhosphate), 7.5 (NaPhosphate), and 8.5 (glycine). The
PET solids loading was 3.5 mg in a 0.5 mL reaction (0.7 wt/v
%). The enzyme was added (5 μg) to reach a final enzyme
loading of 1.43 mg/g PET. The plates were mixed briefly via
shaking, heat sealed with foil, and incubated at either 40 or 60
°C without shaking for 48 h.
51
Enzymes were grouped by yield to determine the number of
conditions possible to test. Those with high enough yields
were tested in 32 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 2 PET
substrates, in duplicate) (Figure 2A). Enzymes yielding less
were tested in 8 conditions (4 pHs, 2 temperatures, 1 PET
substrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2B) and those with the lowest
yields were tested in 4 conditions (4 pHs, 1 temperature (40
°C), 1 PET substrate (cryPow)) (Figure 2C). In Round 1, the
pH levels tested were 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. In later rounds,
lower pHs were targeted and the values tested were 4.5, 5.5,
6.5, and 7.5. The assays were analyzed using ultraviolet−visible
(UV−Vis) spectroscopy of the aromatic products released:
TPA, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET).
28,52
Overall, 115 active enzymes were identified, or 54% of the
212 tested. Activity was defined as an aromatic absorbance
reading at 260 nm of 0.05 above the blank in at least 1
condition. The number of active enzymes in different
condition categories is given in Table 2. Figure 2A−C displays
the 58 most active enzymes with activity in at least 1 condition
above 25 μmol product/mg enzyme. The activity profiles for
all active enzymes are shown in Figures S4−S6, as well as a
comparison to a benchmark enzyme, LCC-ICCG, which was
included as a positive control in all assay plates.
21
Compared to
LCC-ICCG, an engineered PET hydrolase with very high
activity on amorphous film at high temperatures but limited
activity at low pH conditions,
21
the active enzymes identified
in this study display moderate to low activity near LCC-
ICCG’s optimal conditions. However, several showed superior
performance at the challenging pH 4.5 condition, which we
targeted for increased industrial relevance. Despite their
comparable or superior performance to the benchmark at
low pH, we anticipate that further engineering will be required
to achieve activity levels sufficient for meaningful bioreactor
studies. For PET hydrolases identified here that were tested on
both substrates, they appear in most cases to be more active on
crystalline PET powder than amorphous PET film. This
observation may be due to the increased surface area, different
surface properties, and availability of initial and easily cleavable
noncrystalline regions in the powder versus the film.
Our iterative machine learning approach led to notable
performance improvements across successive rounds, as
reflected in increased hit rates for activity in any condition
tested (44% in Round 1 to 67% in round 3), increased hit rates
for activity specifically at low pH (crystalline powder pH = 5.5,
40 °C, 19% in round 1 to 59% in Round 3), and higher average
thermal stability (52.8 °C in Round 1 to 59.0 °C in Round 3),
as shown in Figure 2D. Full counts of number of enzymes
tested and hit rates for all condition sets over each round are
given in Table S2. We note that the interpretation of the hit
rate for activity in any condition is complicated by the fact that
not all enzymes were tested in all conditions. For low pH, the
pronounced improvement in hit rate for Round 3 was likely
due to the addition of supervised predictors trained on low-
noise assay data from previous rounds, unlike earlier rounds
which relied on globally trained predictors of PET hydrolase
activity data from disparate experiments in literature (D1−513-
scraped). The hit rate increase was more pronounced for
crystalline powder activity, for which we tested the most
homologues. In Rounds 2 and 3, the hit rate and average T
m
increase is likely due to the addition of dedicated predictors for
acid tolerance and thermal stability, including EpHod and T
m
predictions.

Many enzymes exhibited higher activity at the
lower temperature tested (40 °C), likely due to their lower

thermostability and destabilization at higher temperatures. For
enzymes with higher thermostability, such as ESM050 (T
m
=
82.3 °C), higher activities were observed at the higher
temperature (60 °C). Generally, temperature enhances
catalytic rate as long as the enzyme remains stable and active
at those temperatures. As the median value of T
m
in the
enzymes studied was ∼ 57 °C, it is unsurprising that most
showed reduced activity at 60 °C.
From the PET hydrolases that were successfully purified and
assayed for PET hydrolytic activity, we analyzed the sequence
diversity (Figure 3). A phylogenetic tree based on sequence
similarity of all sequences that showed activity along with
previously reported PET hydrolases is given in Appendix A,
where many of the sequences tested fall in the phylum
Actinomycetes. A subset of that tree is shown in Figure 3A,
including a few commonly studied PET hydrolases and the
candidates that we found with >20 μmol product/mg of
enzyme conversion at pH 5.5, crystalline powder, 40 °C. We
additionally computed a 2D uniform manifold approximation
(UMAP) based on pairwise negative BLOSUM62 scores
between active PET hydrolases in this study and those from
previous studies in Figure 3B.
9−11
Figure S7 depicts the space
of this mapping for each previous study separately. We observe
that the PET hydrolases from this work are generally within
the manifold of known enzymes, although we saturate some
areas that previously had few examples. Of the 115 PET
hydrolases found to be active in this study, 23 were recently
described by Seo et al.,
11
and many but not all of our low pH
active candidates fall within the cluster they identified as most
performant. In general, candidates with nonzero activity at low
pH appears to congregate. All sequences shared a catalytic
domain with the Asp-His-Ser triad within the conserved α/β
hydrolase fold, as shown by the alignment of Cα atoms for
each Alphafold2 predicted structure against LCC-ICCG using
mTm-align (Table S3).
53
A subset of enzymes were noted to contain additional
carbohydrate binding domains (CBMs), which we labeled with
dbCAN2.
54
Interestingly, those with CBM13 were more likely
to be active at pH 4.5, with 50% of CBM13 enzymes active in
this condition compared to 17% of all tested enzymes active in
this condition. These CBM13-containing enzymes are likely
components of enzyme cocktails for the interaction with or
breakdown of natural polyesters, such as cutin and suberin
found in proximity to carbohydrates, for example in the plant
cell wall.
55
These are marked with squares in Figure 3A,B
where they occupy a single branch on the tree (outlined) and
cluster in 2D sequence space, based solely on the tree
calculation using only the catalytic domain. A subcluster of the
CBM13 domain, labeled CBM13(Sub) and annotated as ricin
B lectin, had an even higher hit rate at pH 4.5 with 11 out of
13 enzymes active (85%) as shown in Figure S8. The
mechanism of this trend is unclear, but it may be influenced
by evolutionary pressures on the CBM being coupled to other
properties that contribute to pH tolerance. While acknowl-
edging that the enzymes explored here are not the entirety of
known sequence space, in conjunction with PET hydrolase
searches in the literature to date, our findings suggest that
moderate PET hydrolysis activity is prevalent across enzyme
classes and considerable sequence distances. This is consistent
with the hypothesis of diverse promiscuity for this substrate.
To provide a basis for structural investigations, we selected
the most performant enzymes from our Round 1 candidates
that also expressed well in the small-scale experiments.
Expression of these enzymes was scaled-up, and one enzyme,
DP043 from Actinoplanes sp. DH11, was successfully crystal-
lized, with the crystal structure being determined using
molecular replacement (Table S4 and Figure S9A). The
crystal structure aligns closely with other known PET
hydrolases with an all-atom RMSD of 0.827 Å from LCC-
ICCG (PDB: 6THT) and 0.512 Å from the Alphafold
structure of its closest identified homologue in the HMM
search, enzyme 407 from Erickson et al. (Figure S9B).
9
While
multiple AlphaFold models have been shown to closely
correlate with independent crystallographic models of these
compact α/β folds,
9
we wanted to validate this here. Alignment
of the DP043 AlphaFold3 and crystallographic models shows
close alignment, including side chains, with an all-atom RMSD
of only 0.266 Å and accurate prediction via Alphafold3 of the
location of the Ca
2+
ion observed in the crystal structure
(Figure S9C). The crystal structure revealed a Ca
2+
ion, a
feature known in other PET hydrolases which has been
targeted for rational engineering due to its role in stabilizing

in the crystal structure of DP043 was not
located in the same position as observed in the engineered
examples, such as LCC and TfCut2 (Figure S9D) and further
studies would be required to evaluate if the Ca

serves a similar purpose.
Sequence and Surface Properties Associated with
Low pH Activity. Using the activity data collected at multiple
pH conditions, we explored differences between enzymes
active at low pH and those active only at higher pH levels. We
split the enzymes into those two groups with 35 active at low
pH (pH 4.5) and 57 active only at higher pHs to evaluate
differences in sequence conservation, predicted pK
a
, and
surface properties. For each residue in the alignment of all
sequences, we determined any statistically significant (p <
0.05) differences for these properties (conservation, pK
a
,
electrostatics, hydrophobicity, circular variance), with further
details provided in the Methods. Table S5 contains all
significant factors identified mapped back to LCC-ICCG and
the alignment of all active sequences. Appendix B shows per-
residue distributions of each property where a significant
difference between performance groups was found.
For each candidate, we counted how many of these
significant factors were observed and compared that number
to its activity at pH 4.5 in Figure 4A, where we see a Spearman
correlation of 0.53 (p < 0.05). Looking specifically at amino
acid conservation, we found 9 sequence positions that were
more conserved for enzymes with low pH activity than for
those with only neutral activity (Figure 4B). The distribution
of amino acids at these positions is given in Appendix B.
Significant differences were also observed for hydrophobicity,
measured using the Kyte-Doolittle method.
56
Most of the
surface tended to be more hydrophobic for low pH active
candidates than neutral activity, seen in Figure 4C, where we
show the average shift. This trend is exacerbated near the
substrate binding site such as A62, V177 and I208 on LCC-
ICCG which each had a shift of 1.0 units or more for low pH
active enzymes. The observed properties for two enzymes with
pH optima <6, ESM065 (which showed equivalent activity to
LCC-ICCG at pH 4.5) and ESM091 are given in Figure 4D,E.
Both exhibited more factors that were associated with low pH
activity than the average for inactive candidates, have >6 out of
9 of the conserved residues identified, and have a hydrophobic
region near the binding site. Mappings of all properties where
differences are found and the observed properties for all
candidates are shown in Appendix C. It is important to note
that these trends are not absolute; for instance, although low

(A) The relationship between the number of factors
held by an enzyme as a function of its experimental activity for crystalline powder, pH = 4.5, T = 40 °C, where enzymes with more observed factors
tend to have higher activity. (B) Nine residues mapped to LCC-ICCG that were more conserved for low pH activity than they were for neutral
activity. (C) Mean difference in surface Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity, again mapped to LCC-ICCG, between the low pH active group and the

comparable activity to LCC-ICCG at pH 4.5 and a pH optima <6. Left: counts of factors (conservation, pK

factors found to be significant when comparing these groups, those exhibited by ESM065 (if the ESM065 value is closer to the acid tolerant mean)
are marked. Larger and brighter regions of the protein backbone indicate more factors (max 6). Middle: Residues that tended to be conserved for
acid tolerance that we observed in ESM095 (6 out of 9). Right: hydrophobicity for ESM095, only colored for positions that where significant

pH activity was generally associated with a decrease in surface
electrostatics, TEP109, exhibits a positive surface charge, and
has a lower total count of factors than would be expected given
the trend in Figure 4A. Further testing with, for example,
adsorption assays may help elucidate mechanistic interpreta-
tions for these identified correlations.
We additionally identified 13 positions in the catalytic
domain with significantly different predicted pK
a
s between
enzymes active at low pH (4.5 and 5.5) compared to those
with activity only at higher pH (6.5, 7.5, 8.5), five of which
occur in or in close proximity to the catalytic triad, as shown in
Figure 5. For the low pH active enzymes, on average the
catalytic histidine exhibited a negative shift of −0.37 pK
a
,
suggesting more deprotonation at low pH for acid tolerant
candidates, potentially facilitating an easier proton transfer
from serine as it attacks the substrate nucleophile. The trend
for the catalytic aspartate was an increase in average pK
a
by
0.26, which differs from findings for serine proteases with a
similar mechanism where it is suggested that the deprotonated
aspartate helps position the histidine.
42,58
It is possible that this
is impacted by or offset by a number of other observations.
First, the downstream residue from serine is a histidine in 94%
of active enzymes (position 300 in the multiple sequence
alignment), and when histidine it exhibits a large positive
predicted pK
a
shift of 1.5 for acid tolerant candidates. This
histidine may be serving a similar purpose to the catalytic
aspartate from the opposite side and protonation state. We also
note three other residues within 15 Å (using the TEP109
predicted structure) of the catalytic histidine that are
frequently charged in the PET hydrolases studied here.
Given that electrostatic potential scales inversely with distance,
these positions likely contribute to the pK
a
of active site
residues. The residue directly downstream of the catalytic
histidine (aligned position 383) is aspartate in 80% of acid
tolerant candidates compared to 13% in neutral active
candidates. All enzymes with pH optima <6 have this aspartate.
There is also a position about 9 Å from the active site (aligned
position 224), and in close proximity to H300, that is leucine
and uncharged in 94% of examples. The only exceptions are
TEP109 (the top performer at pH 4.5), two other enzymes
with activity comparable to LCC-ICCG at pH 4.5, and another
two that were acid tolerant that have a charged glutamic acid in
this position. It is possible that this glutamic acid (Glu224) is
contributing to the positive shift of His300 and cascading to
the negative shift of the catalytic proton transferring
histidine.
59
Finally, alignment position 378, about 14 Å away
is nearly always glutamic acid for active candidates, except in a
few examples, 4 out of 5 being acid tolerant, and including
TEP109 where it is an uncharged glutamine. A depiction of the
active site of TEP109, which exhibits all these features and
demonstrated the highest activity at pH 4.5 is given in Figure
5. Further testing, such as with a mutational scan, may establish
causation to the pK
a
correlations identified in this data set.
PET Homolog Activity Predictors Applied to Sub-
strate, pH, and Temperature. We next used our data to
probe the ability of HMMs and supervised activity predictors
like those used in experimental Rounds 1−3 as a function of
condition and data set size. First, we tested three different
HMMs (the “starting” HMMs) for their ability to distinguish
active from nonactive candidates measured by area under the
receiver operator curve (AUROC): HMM-17, which was used
in the search in Erickson et al., HMM-61, which was used for
the Round 1 search in this work, and an alignment of D1−513-
Scraped, the largest set of known active PETases at the time.
Results for select conditions are shown for in Table 3 below.
We observed that performance varied across conditions and
was sensitive to the PET hydrolases included in the search
HMM, with values ranging from worse than random (<0.5) to
>0.85 (Table S6). We found that HMM-17, which included
mostly thermally stable PET hydrolases tested on amorphous
and analog substrates tended to outperform the HMMs with
larger sets of active PET hydrolases from the literature,
particularly for high temperature activity on amorphous film.
Performance of all HMMs is no better than random for
crystalline powder and acidic conditions.
We further looked to investigate the utility of our data
collected across different conditions (in this study, various

pH activity and those with activity at higher pH, mapped to the
structure of TEP109. All residue positions are given relative to the
MSA alignment. The difference in predicted pK

those groups where it was found to be statistically significant is given
in the third row. These include the proton transferring histidine
(H384, teal), catalytic aspartate (D352, pink), and a histidine (H300,
orange) directly adjacent to the catalytic serine (S301, purple). Three
other residues within 15 Å that are often or sometimes charged are
highlighted (alignment positions: E224 (green), D383 (black), Q378
(yellow)). AlphaFold3 prediction was used to “dock” a trimer of PET
(blue), and all distances (Å) shown use the TEP109 predicted
structure.
57
TEP109 is the top performing candidate at pH 4.5 and
one of a very small number to exhibit E224 and an uncharged amino
acid at alignment position 378.

pHs, temperatures, and substrates) for enhancing our
predictors. First, we tested “tuning” the HMMs by adding
candidates that exhibited activity at the target condition,
testing in 5-fold cross validation. We were able to increase
performance by more than 0.05 AUROC for multiple
conditions by tuning HMMs with data from our assay. The
effect of tuning each HMM across conditions is shown in
Figure S10. Notably, HMM-17 exhibited a pronounced
improvement compared to the larger HMMs, which were
saturated with PET hydrolases not necessarily active under the
condition of interest. These results suggest that HMM searches
could benefit from using a smaller, more targeted set of
enzymes tested at the specific condition, rather than
constructing large alignments based on data collected across
varying conditions.
Next, we used the data collected in this study to train
supervised models, like the activity predictor used in Round 3,
in cross validation for each condition. We compared the
performance of these models against HMM-17, tuned HMM-
17, and the supervised model trained on literature data and
used in Round 2. Figure 6A and Table S7 show the
performance of all models for conditions where at least 10
active enzymes were found. Other conditions are not included
as not enough data were available. In general, we see that for
conditions where we collected more data (cryPow, 40 °C, pH
4.5−7.5), the tuned and supervised models performed better
(at least 0.1 AUROC increase) compared to the starting
HMM-17 or the Round 2 supervised predictor (“lit.
supervised”). Furthermore, supervised training consistently
outperformed HMM tuning. For some conditions, (such as
cryPow and pH < 6), HMM-17 performs no better than
random; however, the condition-specific supervised models
can salvage AUROC of up to 0.8. There is a clear decrease in
supervised model performance for conditions where fewer
enzymes were tested, with some instances where performance
was lower than the starting HMMs. These results suggest that
for mining enzyme sequences for specific activities, exper-
imental measurements at a condition of interest for a starting
set of homologs should be used to evaluate supervised
performance compared to the HMM. Once supervised
performance is greater than the HMM alone, such predictors
should be used to filter searches in a feedback loop.
Finally, we investigated whether these supervised models
had the potential to improve hit rates if applied to search for
novel enzyme candidates by evaluating their performance on
the existing data set. Figure 6B presents the model predictions
compared to observed activity in cross-validation for
conditions with high-performing models (cryPow, 40 °C,
4.5−7.5). Figure S11 shows performance for all models. We set
the decision boundary at the default threshold of 0.5, with
those enzymes classified higher predicted as “active” and lower
predicted as “inactive”. We observed for each condition a high
precision score (the proportion of true positive predictions out
of all positive predictions made by the model) of >75%.
Specifically, for cryPow, 40 °C, pH 5.5, the precision score was
75%, which represents a putative increase in hit rate of +25%
from the observed hit rate in Round 3, which used fewer
training data and did not distinguish between conditions, and
+55% compared to Round 1, which did not use condition-
specific assay data (Figure 2D). The results indicate that
supervised models have strong potential for identifying
homologues while minimizing the screening of inactive
enzymes.
■
CONCLUSION
The expansion of genomic databases, along with significant
advances in machine learning, bioinformatics, and HTP
screening, offer the potential to drive major progress in
enzyme discovery. This study showcases how these tools can
accelerate the identification of new variants of PET-degrading
enzymes with unique activity profiles across substrates, pH,
and temperature from the promiscuous enzymes in nature. By
leveraging both PET hydrolase specific data sets and large
protein data sets, we showed that candidate enzymes can be
saturated toward activity at a condition of interest�
particularly those with enhanced thermostability and lower
pH optima. Notably, we observed an average T
m
near 60 °C
and multiple PET hydrolases with pH optima <6 and activity
at pH 4.5 on crystalline powder that is equal to or greater than
the activity of LCC-ICCG. We further showed that once a
sufficient number of candidates have been tested in a condition
of interest, the hit rate can be progressively improved through
informed selection for that condition. In contrast to traditional
homologue clustering screens, we propose a condition-focused,

targeted approach that combines iterative screening and
supervised learning to guide the discovery of engineering
targets tailored to industrially relevant environments. This
approach not only increases efficiency but enables the
generation of large uniform data sets suitable for analyzing
sequence-function relationships. We expect this framework will
support the discovery of more efficient biocatalysts for plastic
recycling and other applications.
