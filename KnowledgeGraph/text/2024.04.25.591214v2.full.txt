The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising method of 20 
advanced plastic recycling. Traditional protein engineering methods often fall short in 21 
exploring protein sequence space for optimal enzymes due to structural and rational 22 
design limitations. Our study addresses this by using multiplexed ancestral sequence 23 
reconstruction (mASR) to explore the evolutionary sequence space of PET -degrading 24 
cutinases. With a dataset of 397 cutinase sequences, we created a diverse library of 25 
ancestral sequences. Experimental characterization of 48 ancestral sequences revealed 26 
a wide range of PETase activities, highlighting the value of mASR in uncovering functional 27 
variants when compared to traditional ASR. Our results showed that PETase activity in 28 
cutinases evolved through diverse pathways involving distal mutations to the active site, 29 
and is readily accessible within this family. Additionally, our analysis of the PETase fitness 30 
landscape using one -hot encoding (OHE) and local ancestral sequence embedding 31 
(LASE) highlighted the effectiveness of LASE in capturing sequence features relevant to 32 
activity. This work emphasizes the utility of mASR as a protein engineering tool for 33 
identifying enhanced PET -degrading enzymes, and the advantages of the LASE 34 
embedding scheme in mapping the PETase fitness landscape. 35

Introduction 38 
 39 
Over 350 million tonnes of plastic are produced annually, with the majority being derived from 40 
petrochemicals1. However, the current global recycling rate of plastics is estimated to be less 41 
than 10%, partially due to the technological constraints of mechanical (melt -extrusion) 42 
recycling2. There is a pressing need to develop advanced and scalable recycling methods that 43 
will enable the transition towards a circular plastic economy. In the last decade, enzymatic 44 
depolymerization of plastics has emerged as one such advanced recycling method 3. The 45 
enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a versatile thermoplastic 46 
commonly found in food and beverage packaging, and polyester textiles has received 47 
particular interest3. 48 
 49 
PET-degrading enzymes that have been characterized to date, including those classified as 50 
cutinases4–6 (EC 3.1.1.74),  lipases7 (EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxylesterases8 (EC 3.1.1.1), belong 51 
to the esterase subclass (EC 3.1) and are characterized by a catalytic triad (Ser -His-Asp) 52 
typical of the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily. Cutinases have garnered significant interest due 53 
to their ability to hydrolyse both aromatic and aliphatic polyesters9. Cutinases of bacterial5,9,10, 54 
fungal7, and metagenomic11–13 origins have been studied for their PETase activity, including 55 
Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut from Thermobifida cellulosilytica5, TfCut2 from Thermobifida fusca5, 56 
HiC from Humicola insolens14, FsC from Fusarium solani pisi 15, and LCC from leaf -branch 57 
compost metagenome 16. However, extant cutinases are often unsuitable for direct use in 58 
industrial processes, necessitating optimisation to improve properties such as catalytic 59 
efficiency17, stability under harsh conditions18,19, and to alleviate product inhibition 20. For 60 
example, active site optimisation through rational design 6,10,21 and evolutionarily -guided 61 
engineering20 has yielded significant improvements in PET hydrolysis across various cutinase 62 
backgrounds. While structure-guided protein engineering has been effective in improving the 63 
efficiency of extant PETases, it has provided little insight on the mechanisms by which PETase 64 
activity emerges or has been optimized by evolution. 65 
 66 
Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which utilizes a phylogenetic tree and a statistical 67 
model of evolution to infer the sequences of extinct, ancestral proteins, can provide critical 68 
insights into molecular evolution and functional diversification within protein families 22. ASR 69 
has been useful in studying sequence -function relationships over protein families 23,24; such 70 
insight can shed light on the topologies of fitness landscapes that dictate the adaptive potential 71 
of proteins25. For example, ASR can give insight into the ruggedness (i.e. complexity) of a 72 
fitness landscape over large spans of evolutionarily accessible sequence space to reveal 73

fitness peaks that are inaccessible through stepwise mutational approaches 24. In addition to 74 
this, ASR is also frequently used to engineer enzymes with enhanced industrial properties22,26–75 
28, making it a valuable tool in both protein engineering and understanding the mechanisms of 76 
molecular evolution. 77 
 78 
More recently, protein representation learning has become a widely used method in protein 79 
engineering and evolutionary inference29,30. Protein language models (PLM), which are deep 80 
neural networks trained to predict the identities of masked residues in a corpus of protein 81 
sequences29–32, can map information sparse and high dimensional protein sequences to fixed-82 
length vector representations. These vector representations capture the evolutionary and 83 
biophysical features of protein sequences in the representation model’s latent embedding 84 
space29,30. Indeed, PLMs have been used to learn the structure of fitness landscapes33–35, and 85 
can learn evolutionary features when trained with ancestrally reconstructed sequence data36.  86 
 87 
In this study, we applied ASR to explore the evolutionarily accessible sequence space of PET-88 
degrading cutinases. Using a dataset of 397 extant cutinase sequences with significant 89 
homology to known cutinases with PETase activity, we adopted a multiplexed ASR (mASR) 90 
approach to generate a diverse library of ancestral cutinase sequences. Through experimental 91 
characterization of 48 ancestral cutinases, we identified a broad range of PETase activities, 92 
including between equivalent nodes on distinct yet statistically indifferent phylogenetic 93 
topologies. Such findings highlight the importance of sampling diverse phylogenetic 94 
backgrounds to uncover functional ancestral variants. Furthermore, our study analyzed the 95 
topology of the PETase fitness landscape through two sequence embedding schemes: one -96 
hot encoding (OHE) and the more recently described local ancestral sequence embedding 97 
(LASE)36. We found that LASE was more effective in capturing cutinase sequence features 98 
pertinent to PETase activity, demonstrating a clear pattern of iterative improvement in PETase 99 
functionality throughout the sequence exploration phases of our study. This comprehensive 100 
approach not only highlights the utility of mASR in uncovering novel PETase variants but also 101 
emphasizes the role of advanced embedding techniques in mapping PETase fitness 102 
landscapes. 103

Multiplexed ASR yields functional PETases from diverse phylogenetic backgrounds. 111 
 112 
We used ASR to explore the PETase functional sequence space of the cutinase family. To 113 
maximize diversity in the local sequence space around known PETases, such as TfCut2 and 114 
LCC, we employed the recently described multiplexed ASR (mASR)36. In brief, mASR samples 115 
multiple statistically indifferent phylogenetic backgrounds from which to reconstruct ancestral 116 
sequences from. This produces diverse libraries of ancestral proteins that span functional 117 
sequence space over a distribution of realistic phylogenies. To achieve this, we performed 20 118 
replicates of maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference and ASR on a single dataset of 119 
397 extant cutinases with significant homology to Tfcut2 and LCC (E -value <= 1E -5). 120 
Consistent with previous phylogenetic studies37, PET hydrolytic cutinases were resolved as a 121 
polyphyletic group of two monophyletic lineages: the Thermobifida sp. PETases, which include 122 
Tfcut2, T. cellulosytica cutinase and T. alba esterase 1 and the LCC-like PETases that include 123 
LCC and BhrPETase. This topology was resolved consistently over all 20 phylogenetic priors 124 
used for mASR ( Figure 1A). The placement of the PETase clades were supported by high 125 
ultra-fast bootstrap approximations 38 (>= 0.95) and the ancestral nodes separating these 126 
groups were reconstructed in CodeML from the PAML 39 suite with relatively high mean 127 
posterior probability (>0.9; based on ASR statistical benchmarking studies 40). The resulting 128 
ancestral sequence library comprised approximately 1600 unique sequences that 129 
encompassed the evolutionarily accessible sequence space of the bacterial cutinase family.  130

We selected 48 ancestral nodes from 20 different trees with homology to the most recent 144 
common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2 for experimental characterization and comparison to 145 
extant cutinases. Specifically, these nodes were chosen from the recent ancestors of the LCC 146 
and TfCut2 lineages (or the most recent common ancestor of both), with at least a single 147 
sequence sampled from each of the 20 distinct phylogenetic trees. Each ancestral sequence 148 
was selected as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence that maximizes the posterior 149 
probability over the full -length of the reconstructed protein. The variants were expressed, 150 
purified and tested for PETase activity. The soluble expression level of each variant was 151 
measured using the Bradford assay ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). PETase activity against 152 
amorphous PET film was measured by UV absorbance at 260 nm to detect the soluble 153 
products of PET hydrolysis after the removal of undigested film, including terephthalic acid 154 
(TPA), mono(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate 155 
(BHET) ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). Among the extant cutinases, the highest PETase 156 
activities were observed for LCC (A 260 nm = 0.34 ± 0.03), BhrPETase from bacterium HR29 157 
(A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01), and a previously engineered variant of LCC with the mutations 158 
F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G (LCC ICCG) 6 (A260 nm = 0.54 ± 0.07), with other cutinases 159 
showing lower activity (Figure 1B). Of the 48 ancestral variants, we observed PETase activity 160 
for a number of ancestral cutinases from a diverse range of trees (Figure 1C). Several variants 161 
(1_533, 35_442, 55_547, 70_439, 70_440, and 85_456) exhibited similar activity to the most 162 
active extant cutinases, LCC and BhrPETase. From this group, we selected ancestors from 163 
tree 35, node 442 (35_442; A260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and tree 55, node 547 (55_547; A260 nm = 164 
0.59 ± 0.09), for further investigation. Notably, these two ancestors belonged to equivalent 165 
positions from two independent phylogenetic trees (Figure 1D-F), representing the most 166 
recent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2, and sharing 98.5% sequence identity to one 167 
another.  168 
 169 
Within the dataset of 48 ancestral sequences, 12 represent the same phylogenetic node (the 170 
most recent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2) over 12 different phylogenetic 171 
backgrounds. Of these, 9 exhibited PETase activity while 3 were inactive on PET. 172 
Interestingly, the PETase ancestor 55_547 and the inactive ancestor 10_543 both represent 173 
equivalent positions (the most recent common ancestor of TfCut2 and LCC) in their respective 174 
phylogenetic backgrounds and differ by only 9/261 positions, yet 55_547 has activity against 175 
PET and 10_543 does not. The functional differences between these sequences arise solely 176 
from the topology of the phylogenetic tree used to reconstruct them and drastically alters how 177 
the evolution of PETase activity could be inferred. For example, in the case of the 55_547 178 
phylogeny, PETase activity appears to be a promiscuous ancestral trait that existed prior to 179 
the discovery of extant PETases (such as LCC and Thermobifida cutinases), whereas the 180

10_543 phylogeny supports the contradictory hypothesis that PETase activity emerged 181 
independently in LCC -like and Thermobifida PETase lineages from an ancestor without 182 
PETase activity. As both topologies failed rejection by the approximately unbiased (AU)41 test 183 
and are statistically indifferent at representing the observed alignment data, it is not possible 184 
to reject one of these hypotheses purely from a phylogenetic perspective. We also observe 185 
no correlation between the mean posterior probability of an ancestor and its activity 186 
(Supplementary Figure  5). This observation is somewhat counterintuitive, as the mean 187 
posterior probability of a sequence, which is the statistical confidence in the identity of a 188 
reconstructed ancestor, is often used to discriminate between poorly reconstructed sequences 189 
(and hence likely to be less fit) and those that are likely to be functional and fit 40. Together, 190 
these results highlight the importance of sampling diverse phylogenetic backgrounds during 191 
ASR when accessing the functional sequence space of a protein family as minor phylogenetic 192 
incongruencies can translate into significant functional differences in (equivalent) 193 
reconstructed ancestral sequences. 194 
 195 
Structural characterization and analysis of ancestral cutinases. 196 
 197 
A comparative structural and sequence analysis of inactive and active ancestors suggests 198 
that PET hydrolysis appears to be a trait that is evolutionarily accessible from within the 199 
cutinase background. Unlike the I. sakaiensis PETase, which emerged through conformational 200 
optimization of the first - and second-shells via obvious selection within the active site 42–44, 201 
PETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages appears to emerge through non -202 
specific and likely neutral mutations that are often distal to the active site ( Figure 2A-C). 203 
Indeed, analysis of ancestral cutinase sequences reveals virtually no differences in the PET 204 
binding sites between PETase active and inactive variants ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). 205 
Furthermore, mutations associated with a gain -of-function vary between the different 206 
phylogenetic trees used to reconstruct the ancestral sequences. For example, ancestors 207 
55_547 and 35_442 are each separated by 9 unique mutations from their closest relatives 208 
without PETase activity (ancestors 10_543  with A15S, A36V, T49S, T92S, N109D, R114S, 209 
N145R, I180V, S226A and 75_539 with A36V, T49D, T92S, M105Q, R114S, S124N, R167T, 210 
P199S, A226S, respectively). Of these loss of function mutations, 3 are shared between either 211 
background, 5 are unique and one is a reversion (S226A for 55_547, A226S for 35_442).   212 
Intuitively, a combination (with at least one) of these mutations are required to be fixed in 213 
either respective cutinase background to impart PETase activity. Similarly, ancestor 10_543 214 
is separated by 8 mutations from its closest  relative with PETase activity (70_439 with E28Q, 215 
S49D, S124N, R145N, V180I, P199S, S215T, A226S); of the 8 mutations associated with 216 
gain-of-function in the background of 10_543, only 3 are specifically shared with gain -of-217

function mutations in 55_547. Nearly all functionally consequential mutations across 218 
backgrounds are distal to the active site and PET binding pocket. This suggests that (i) there 219 
are numerous (and diverse) molecular mechanisms by which PETase activity can emerge 220 
from an ancestral cutinase without PETase activity, (ii) these mechanisms are not obviously 221 
associated with a restructuring of the enzyme active site and (iii) PETase activity is readily 222 
evolutionarily accessible within the cutinase family, consistent with recent observations of 223 
PETases that have emerged from cutinase backgrounds11,12.  224

beyond modification of the active site. Both ancestors crystallized in the C222 space group at 247 
resolutions of 1.5 - 1.8 Å (Supplementary Table 1). Structural analysis revealed the formation 248 
of domain-swapped dimers (Figure 2D). The observation of domain swapping, likely induced 249 
by the high protein concentration in the crystallization conditions, suggests an intrinsic 250 
flexibility of the C -terminus, a characteristic commonly observed in proteins previously 251 
characterized to form domain-swapped dimers47. Given the flexible nature of the C-terminus, 252 
it was hypothesized that introducing a disulfide bond to constrain this region into forming an 253 
intramolecular β-sheet would enhance enzyme stability (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the chosen 254 
site for the disulfide bond coincided with the predicted Ca2+/Mg2+ binding site of the ancestors 255 
based on homology to extant cutinases, a region previously targeted for disulfide bond 256 
engineering in TfCut2 and LCC for improved thermostability and PETase activity 6,48,49. We 257 
introduced the disulfide mutation N20 6C/S253C to ancestor 55_547 and experimental 258 
characterization of the resulting mutant demonstrated an approximately 2 -fold improvement 259 
in whole-cell activity (A 260 nm  = 1.22 ± 0.22) ( Figure 2F) and a 1.5 -fold increase in soluble 260 
expression levels compared to the 55_547 background determined by Bradford assay 261 
(Supplementary Figure 5 ). In combination with our comparative analysis of the selected 262 
inactive and active ancestors, the successful optimization of PETase activity via the 263 
introduction of a disulfide bond distal to the active site illustrates that PETase activity within 264 
the cutinase family can emerge and be enhanced through mechanisms that extend beyond 265 
the structural reconfiguration of the active site. It is therefore likely that activity optimization is, 266 
at least in part, being driven by thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization. 267

 278 
We next experimentally characterized all alternate sequences of ancestors 55_547 (40 279 
mutants) and 35_442 (29 mutants) that individually sampled each mutation that had been 280 
ambiguously reconstructed. Here, we define ambiguity as any site where at least two amino 281 
acids are reconstructed with a posterior probability of >= 0.2. This provided a high resolution 282 
mutagenic map of the local sequence space around either of the ancestral PETase variants. 283 
Ambiguously reconstructed sites were spatially distributed over the protein and not localized 284 
to any specific functional area ( Supplementary Figure 7). Having already established that 285 
the mean posterior probability of an ancestral sequence is a poor indicator of PETase activity 286 
(Supplementary Figure 4B) and that relatively minor changes in the cutinase sequence can 287 
drastically alter PETase activity, we hypothesized that the neighborhood of evolutionarily 288 
possible (albeit less probable) sequences may contain mutations that benefit PETase activity. 289 
This hypothesis was guided by recent ASR studies on the I. sakaiensis PETase branch of the 290 
cutinase phylogeny where PETase activity appeared to emerge transiently within ancestral 291 
lineages50. Experimental characterization revealed that all of the alternate reconstructions of 292 
ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 demonstrated PETase activity that was comparable (or 293 
reduced) to either respective ancestral background (Figure 3A-B).  294

are measured by absorbance at 260 nm after 16 hours incubation with the enzyme at 60 °C. Data are 305 
represented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3) and grouped based on mutations recombined in the background 306 
of 55_547 (left) and 35_442 (middle). 307 
 308 
A subset of randomly sampled combinations of single mutations from the alternate 309 
reconstructions were selected to explore potential epistatic interactions and their impact on 310 
PETase activity. The 7 selected mutations, E1 4D, E28Q, A36V, S52A (in 55_547), F9 4L, 311 
S196A, and H247S, were recombined in various combinations from 2 to 5 point mutations in 312 
the background of 35_442 and 55_547. E28Q, A36V, S52A, S196A, and H247S are surface 313 
mutations, distal from the catalytic and putative PET binding site ( Figure 4A). In contrast, 314 
F94L is positioned within the PET binding site, as deduced from docking of 2HE-(MHET)3 into 315 
both 35_442 and 55_547 (Figure 4A), as well as structural homology to previously predicted 316 
PET binding sites in LCC. As single mutations, E1 4D, E28Q, A36V, F94L and H247S were 317 
considered neutral based on PETase activity relative to the 35_442 background, while S52A 318 
and S19 6A exhibited decreased activity relative to 55_547. In our experimental 319

characterization, we identified 24 recombined variants with increased PETase activity relative 320 
to their ancestral background ( Figure 4B). Specifically, 10 recombined variants in the 321 
background of 55_547 showed increased PETase activity, with the most active being 322 
E14D/E28Q/A36V (A 260 nm = 1.20 ± 0.26), E2 8Q/S196A (A 260 nm = 1.08 ± 0.05), and 323 
E28Q/S52A/S196A (A260 nm = 1.03 ± 0.09). Similarly, 14 recombinations in the background 324 
of 35_442 demonstrated increased activity, with the most active being E28Q/S196A (A260 nm 325 
= 1.42 ± 0.29), E28Q/F94L (A260 nm = 0.99 ± 0.17), and E14D/H247S (A260 nm = 0.77 ± 0.08). 326 
Interestingly, we identified 17 recombined variants that exhibited improved PETase activity 327 
relative to LCC ICCG, the most active extant variant in the study, with 35_442 E2 8Q/S196A, 328 
displaying ~2.5-fold higher activity. 329 
 330 
The mutational analysis of the recombined variants highlighted E2 8Q as a key mutation, 331 
present in 14 of the 17 variants that demonstrated enhanced activity compared to the 332 
engineered LCC ICCG variant. This suggests a positive effect of E2 8Q on PETase activity; 333 
however, this was only observed in the presence of other mutations from the recombinations. 334 
The context dependence of E2 8Q is especially significant when considering the double 335 
mutation E28Q/S196A, which was among the most active in both ancestral backgrounds. 336 
When assessed independently in the 55_547 background, the E2 8Q mutation adversely 337 
affected activity (A260 nm = 0.00 ± 0.00), and the S19 6A mutation similarly led to a reduction 338 
in activity relative to the ancestor (A260 nm = 0.16 ± 0.02). However, the combination of these 339 
mutations resulted in a significant increase in activity beyond the additive effects of the single 340 
mutations (A260 nm = 1.08 ± 0.05), indicative of positive epistatic interactions. 341 
 342 
Ruggedness analysis reveals epistasis in recombined mutations. 343 
 344 
We next analyzed the topology of the PETase fitness landscape over the 196 cutinase 345 
sequences characterized in this study. This was done both to build a holistic overview of 346 
PETase evolution and function in the cutinase family and to assess the effectiveness of this 347 
approach in exploring new -to-nature fitness peaks across functional sequence space. To 348 
achieve this, we embedded cutinase sequences as nodes in a network graph where edges 349 
connect each node to its k nearest (Euclidean) neighbors. The scheme used to embed 350 
sequences therefore dictates the topology of the network graph. When this is the one -hot 351 
encoding (OHE), the Euclidean distance between nodes in the network graph is proportional 352 
to the number of mutations between the sequences they represent. The OHE graph network 353 
therefore captures PETase activity as a function of the mutations between sequences when 354 
the signal over the graph is the measured PETase activity (Figure 5A).  355

Encoding protein sequences as the hidden states of a PLM can capture comparatively richer 357 
features than the OHE 29,30, albeit at the cost of interpretability over the network graph 36. 358 
Euclidean distances in the latent space of a representation model may share no interpretable 359 
relationship with equivalent Euclidean distances in the OHE space, therefore confounding the 360 
interpretation of PETase activity over the network graph to non -linear distances instead of 361 
simple mutational distances.  362 
 363 
We embedded all characterized cutinases in a OHE basis and visualized the resulting 364 
landscape in 2 dimensions with t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) 365 
dimensionality reduction. In this space, ancestral and extant cutinases form homogenous, 366 
random clusters (Figure 5A). The alternate reconstructions of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 367 
and their recombinations are grouped as closely connected clusters around their respective 368 
ancestral backgrounds. Despite their comparable PETase activity, sequences in both 369 
backgrounds are resolved as independent components that share few direct edge 370 
connections, suggesting that the PETase fitness landscape is multi -modal (i.e. there are 371 
multiple solution spaces to competent PETase activity) when considering only naive, residue-372 
wise OHE sequence embeddings.  373 
 374 
We then reconstructed the PETase fitness landscape in a learned representation space. To 375 
ensure that local features of the cutinase sequence space were captured by a PLM, we used 376 
a recently described method of local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE)36. In brief, LASE 377 
trains a small and family-specific deep learning model on ancestrally reconstructed sequence 378 
datasets. The features learned by LASE capture the functional properties of proteins, such as 379 
catalytic efficiency, in a non -linear space that is not interpretable with simple mutational 380 
distances. Embedding in LASE can therefore reveal topological features of the fitness map 381 
that are obfuscated in an OHE embedding.  382 
 383 
Sequences in the LASE embedding space cluster according to their relative fitness and how 384 
they were sampled (e.g. extant, ancestral, alternate or recombined; Figure 5B). For example, 385 
all point mutations from alternate reconstructions and recombinations group together in a 386 
single connected component in the LASE space, irrespective of the genetic background 387 
(ancestors 55_547 or 35_442) they were introduced into. Moreso, ancestral and extant 388 
sequences cluster into disconnected components, despite their often high degree of site-wise 389 
sequence similarity. Indeed, the LASE representation space is highly structured relative to the 390 
OHE space, where ancestral and extant sequences co-occur across distinct identity groups in 391 
the network graph. This indicates that our sequence sampling strategy is highly structured and 392

 14 
systematic over an evolutionarily informative representation space, while appearing 393 
somewhat random in the OHE space. 394 
 395 
Finally, we used a graph signal processing approach to quantify ruggedness in the cutinase 396 
PET fitness landscape. We define ruggedness as the non -linearity between the fitness of a 397 
sequence and its neighbors in the network graph. We use the Dirichlet energy of the graph, 398 
which describes the non-linearity of a signal over a graph, to measure this 36,51,52. In order to 399 
make the Dirichlet energy interpretable as a node-wise local quantity, we calculate it over each 400 
subgraph in the network defined by an edge-length of exactly 1, thus reducing its interpretation 401 
to the deviation from linearity a node demonstrates relative only to its immediate neighbors; 402 
the fitness signal over the network graph changes as a linear function (i.e. is smooth) over 403 
nodes of the graph that are characterized by low local DEs. The local Dirichlet energy is 404 
therefore a descriptor of how confounded by epistasis a sequence is. This analysis revealed 405 
that the fitness landscape is most rugged over the cutinase variants with the greatest PETase 406 
activity. Indeed, the node with the single highest local Dirichlet energy is also the fitness peak 407 
(ancestor 55_547_E28Q/S196A). Importantly, this was true for both OHE and LASE network 408 
graphs (Figure 5C; Supplementary Figure 9 ), indicating that the combinatorial mutations 409 
E28Q/S196A in the 55_547 background would be unlikely to be introduced through a stepwise 410 
mutagenesis approach due to the relatively low activity of each single mutation in isolation. 411 
Together, these analyses demonstrate that mASR can effectively guide protein engineering 412 
by discovering evolutionary features that are not immediately apparent, and can help navigate 413 
rugged regions of sequence space to find fit enzyme variants that are not rationally obvious. 414

Discussion 424 
 425 
In our investigation into the evolutionary sequence space of bacterial cutinases with PETase 426 
activity, we employed multiplexed ASR36 to enhance our exploration. This method allowed us 427 
to reconstruct and analyze ancestral cutinases across 20 diverse phylogenetic topologies, 428 
moving beyond the constraints of a single -tree perspective. Our experimental 429 
characterizations of 20 extant and 48 ancestral cutinases unveiled a wide spectrum of 430 
activities against amorphous PET film (A260 nm = 0.00 - 0.59). Of particular interest were two 431 
ancestors, 35_442 (A 260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and 55_547 (A 260 nm = 0.59 ± 0.09), each 432 
representing the most recent common ancestor of LCC 13 and TfCut25 on independent trees 433 
and exhibiting similar activity to the most active extant cutinases, LCC (A 260 nm = A260 nm = 434 
0.34 ± 0.03) and BhrPETase (A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01). Notably, the use of mASR was crucial 435 
in uncovering the variability of ancestrally reconstructed sequences, as it revealed that 436 
equivalent nodes from independent phylogenetic topologies exhibited highly varied activity 437 
despite all topologies being equally valid representations of the underlying sequence 438 
alignment based on the AU -test. While some ancestors were inactive, others showed 439 
significant PETase activity comparable to characterized extant PETases. These observations 440 
highlight the utility of the mASR method in improving both the success and robustness of ASR 441 
applications in protein engineering. By embracing a wider array of evolutionary scenarios, 442 
mASR allowed for a more comprehensive and reliable identification of functional sequences 443 
relative to a single -tree approach. Multiplexed ASR may therefore become an important 444 
component of ASR- and evolutionary-guided enzyme design strategies in the future.  445 
  446 
Our sequence and structural analysis of active and inactive ancestral cutinases provided 447 
insights on the evolutionary emergence of PETase activity in the cutinase family. In particular, 448 
our findings suggest that PETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages has 449 
emerged through neutral mutations that are distal to the active site, rather than specific 450 
changes localized to the active site itself, as observed in the evolution of I. sakaiensis 451 
PETase37. Our detailed examination of ancestors 35_442 and 55_547, along with their closest 452 
inactive counterparts, highlighted unique gain-of-function mutations leading to PETase activity 453 
from these distinct phylogenetic backgrounds. These findings imply the existence of multiple, 454 
distinct evolutionary pathways for acquiring PETase functionality and indicate that PETase 455 
activity is readily accessible within the cutinase family.  456 
 457 
Our structural analysis also revealed the formation of domain -swapped dimers between 458 
adjacent symmetry mates in the crystal structures of the ancestral variants 35_442 and 459

55_547. While possibly an artifact of the crystallization conditions, this observation suggests 460 
a certain degree of structural flexibility in the C-terminus of these ancestors even in solution. 461 
Based on this observation, we introduced a disulfide bond in the C -terminus of ancestor 462 
55_547 that coincided with the predicted Ca 2+/Mg2+ binding site, a strategy homologous to 463 
similar successful modifications in TfCut2 and LCC that were observed to improve stability 464 
and activity6,48,49. Indeed, the introduction of the disulfide N20 6C/S253C resulted in a variant 465 
of 55_547 with an approximately 2 -fold improvement in whole -cell activity and 1.5 -fold 466 
improvement in soluble expression relative to the background ancestor. 467 
 468 
We deepened our exploration of the evolutionary sequence space of the cutinase family by 469 
addressing ambiguously reconstructed positions in the initial mASR. Ambiguous positions 470 
were identified based on a posterior probability threshold of ≥ 0.2 for the second most probable 471 
residue. Introducing these 69 alternate reconstructions as single mutations into 35_442 and 472 
55_547, we observed that most mutations were either neutral or decreased PETase activity 473 
relative to the ancestral background. However, when we recombined a random subset of the 474 
alternate reconstructions, we observed several recombinations in the background of both 475 
35_442 (E2 8Q/S196A) and 55_547 (E1 4D/E28Q/A36V) that displayed increased PETase 476 
activity, not only relative to the initial ancestors, but also to an engineered variant of LCC with 477 
enhanced activity, LCC ICCG 6. Notably, the most active recombinations exhibited activity 478 
improvements that exceeded the additive effects predicted from their individual mutations, 479 
highlighting positive epistatic interactions that contribute to their PETase activity. 480 
 481 
To complement our experimental investigations, we modeled the sequence-fitness landscape 482 
of all 196 cutinase sequences characterized in our study, employing a graph signal processing 483 
approach that elucidates the complex topology of the PETase fitness landscape. This 484 
methodology involved embedding cutinase sequences as nodes in a network graph, where 485 
each node was connected to its k nearest (Euclidean) neighbors, thereby enabling a direct 486 
comparison between two embedding schemes, OHE and LASE. While OHE provides a 487 
straightforward mutational distance metric between sequences, it often oversimplifies the 488 
nuanced relationship between sequence variation and function. In contrast, LASE, by training 489 
a family-specific deep learning model on our dataset of ancestrally reconstructed sequences, 490 
captures the functional properties of proteins in an abstract manner, revealing non -linear 491 
sequence-activity relationships that are obscured in OHE representations. 492 
 493 
Using LASE to map the sequence -fitness landscape, we highlighted iterative improvements 494 
in PETase activity throughout the different phases of our sequence exploration of the cutinase 495 
family. This embedding not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the functional 496

 18 
implications of sequence variation but also allowed us to identify clusters of sequences with 497 
similar functional profiles, regardless of their evolutionary background. Moreover, our analysis 498 
of the fitness landscape's ruggedness via LASE provided new insights into the role of epistasis 499 
in PETase activity. The local Dirichlet energy calculations revealed that sequences with the 500 
highest PETase activity were associated with the greatest ruggedness, suggesting that the 501 
most functionally optimized variants emerge from complex interplays of multiple mutations 502 
rather than from linear accumulations of beneficial single mutations. This observation 503 
highlights the significance of epistatic interactions in driving the evolutionary innovation of 504 
PETase activity, illustrating that successful enzyme variants often lie in regions of the fitness 505 
landscape that are not readily accessed through single mutational steps, but can be accessed 506 
using evolutionarily-guided approaches, such as mASR. 507

mean values such that the mean of the scaled absorbance values equaled the mean of the 563 
replicate with the mid -range mean value. To ensure scaling improved consistency between 564 
replicates, correlograms of the data before ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) and after 565 
(Supplementary Figure 4) scaling were produced to confirm the monotonic (rank) correlation 566 
between replicates was preserved. 567 
 568 
Cloning of TEV-PETase variants for crystallography studies. Primer pairs containing the 569 
DNA sequence for the TEV cleavage site (5' -GAAAACCTGTATTTTCAAAGC-3') were 570 
constructed, specific to each PETase variant. PCR was performed using these primers and 571 
PETase variant genes to create mutant fragments. These fragments were reassembled using 572 
Gibson Assembly59 and checked through Sanger sequencing to ensure the TEV cleavage site 573 
was correctly introduced. 574 
 575 
Large scale protein expression and purification. The TEV -PETase ancestral variants 576 
plasmids were transformed using electroporation into electrocompetent E. cloni® cells 577 
(Lucigen) and plated onto LB agar supplemented with 100 µg/mL kanamycin. The plates were 578 
incubated overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was inoculated into a 10 mL solution of LB media 579 
with 100 µg/mL kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 180 rotations per minute 580 
(rpm). This liquid starter culture was then added to 1 L of autoinduction media60 (6 g Na2HPO4, 581 
3 g KH2PO4, 20 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, 10 mL of 60% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mL of 582 
10% (w/v) glucose, and 25 mL of 8% (w/v) lactose) with 100 µg/mL kanamycin and incubated 583

for 24 hours at room temperature and 180 rpm. The cells were separated from the media by 584 
centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 minutes at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (400 mM 585 
NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 U/mL Turbonuclease (Sigma), and 50 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0). The 586 
resuspended cell solution was lysed using two rounds of sonication at 50% power and pulse 587 
time for 5 minutes, with 5 minutes on ice between sonication steps. Next, the sample was 588 
centrifuged at 32000 × g for 60 minutes at 4 °C, and the soluble cell solution was separated 589 
from the insoluble cell material and filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size filter. The filtered 590 
soluble cell solution was passed through an equilibrated Nickel -charged IMAC using a 5 mL 591 
HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in Lysis Buffer. The protein bound to the column 592 
was eluted using elution buffer (400 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 50 mM Tris -HCl pH 593 
8.0). The protein sample was buffer exchanged to TEV reaction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM 594 
EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0) using a PD -10 desalting 595 
column and diluted to 50 mL in this buffer. A 1 mL solution containing 1 mg/ml of purified TEV 596 
protease was added and incubated at room temperature overnight. The cleaved sample was 597 
passed through an equilibrated Nickel -charged IMAC using a 5 mL HisTrap HP (GE 598 
Healthcare Life Sciences), and the flowthrough was collected. This flowthrough was 599 
concentrated using the 3 kDa Amicon® ultra 15 mL centrifugal filters and filtered through a 600 
0.22 μm filter. Finally, the cleaved protein was purified to homogeneity using size -exclusion 601 
chromatography, and the HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) 602 
was equilibrated in size-exclusion buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5). 603 
 604 
Protein crystallisation and structure determination. Proteins were concentrated using the 605 
3 kDa Amicon® ultra 15 mL centrifugal filters to 15 -36 mg/ml and crystallized in 20% (w/v) 606 
PEG 3350 alongside 0.2 M salt and BisTris buffer solution. Specifically, ancestor 55_547 in 607 
0.2 M sodium/potassium tartrate, 0.1 M BisTris propane pH 7.5 and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350; and 608 
ancestor 35_442 in 0.2 M sodium malonate, 0.1 M BisTris propane pH 6.5 and 20% (w/v) PEG 609 
3350. The X -ray diffraction data were collected on the MX2 beamline at the Australian 610 
Synchrotron61. The data was processed using XDS 62, and the phase problem was resolved 611 
with molecular replacement using the PETase WT structure (PDB: 6EQE) as the search 612 
model. The ligands and solvent molecules were removed and then used as the search model 613 
part of Phaser (CCP4) 63. The structure was refined using phenix.refine 64 through multiple 614 
iterative steps, and rebuilt each time with Coot 65. The structures of ancestors 55_547 and 615 
35_442 were deposited in the protein data bank under the PDB ID of 8ETX and 8ETY, 616 
respectively. 617

produce OHE, aligned PETase sequences were converted into a (20	 × 	267) vectors where 621 
gaps were represented as a zero vector of length 20. The LASE embedding model was 622 
implemented as a Transformer in PyTorch 2.0.1 as previously described36, with three encoder 623 
blocks with 2-headed multihead attention (64 dimensions) and a feed-forward fully-connected 624 
layer (128 dimensions). The LASE embedding model was trained with a masking percent of 625 
15%, over 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 using the Adam optimizer. Loss was determined 626 
as the categorical cross entropy loss. Performance over training was assessed with perplexity 627 
and categorical accuracy (Supplementary Figure 8).  628 
 629 
Local Dirichlet energy calculations. 630 
To estimate the local ruggedness of each PETase variant, the k -nearest neighbors of each 631 
node were used to produce a KNN sub-graph for each variant with scikit-learn 1.2.1. The kNN 632 
sub-graphs were made symmetric by defining an edge in either direction to be a single edge. 633 
The dirichlet energy was calculated as previously described52,66:  634 
 635 
𝜆! = 1/𝑁	𝑦"𝐿𝑦 636 
 637 
Where, λm is normalized dirichlet energy, N, the number of variants in the sub -graph, y, the 638 
activity (absorbance) of each variant and L the graph Laplacian operator of the adjacency 639 
matrix of each kNN sub-graph. 640
