There is keen interest to develop new technologies to recycle
the plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). To this end, the
use of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes has shown promise for PET
deconstruction to its monomers, terephthalate (TPA) and
ethylene glycol (EG). Here, the Ideonella sakaiensis PETase wild-
type enzyme was compared to a previously reported improved
variant (W159H/S238F). The thermostability of each enzyme
was compared and a 1.45 Å resolution structure of the mutant
was described, highlighting changes in the substrate binding
cleft compared to the wild-type enzyme. Subsequently, the
performance of the wild-type and variant enzyme was com-
pared as a function of temperature, substrate morphology, and
reaction mixture composition. These studies showed that
reaction temperature had the strongest influence on perform-
ance between the two enzymes. It was also shown that both
enzymes achieved higher levels of PET conversion for substrates
with moderate crystallinity relative to amorphous substrates.
Finally, the impact of product accumulation on reaction
progress was assessed for the hydrolysis of both PET and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). Each enzyme displayed
different inhibition profiles to mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephtha-
late (MHET) and TPA, while both were sensitive to inhibition by
EG. Overall, this study highlights the importance of reaction
conditions, substrate selection, and product accumulation for
catalytic performance of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes, which have
implications for enzyme screening in the development of
enzyme-based polyester recycling.
Introduction
Enzymatic depolymerization of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) is a promising approach for recycling of this abundant
polyester.
[1]
Multiple PET hydrolases have been identified and
characterized,
[2]
including the PETase enzyme from Ideonella
sakaiensis.
[3]
IsPETase, together with a second enzyme, MHETase,
forms a two-enzyme system for the conversion of PET to its
monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).
[4]
Using IsPETase as a model system, numerous engineering
studies have been reported that present modified enzymes
with improved thermal stability and catalytic activity relative to
the wild-type enzyme.
[5]
Of relevance to this work, a mutant
variant of IsPETase (W159H/S238F) was previously reported,
[6]
where two amino acid substitutions modify the enzyme’s active
site to more closely match that of a cutinase from Thermobifida
fusca, TfCut2.
[7]
Here, we present an assessment of enzymatic performance
for the wild-type IsPETase
[3,5a,c,8]
(hereafter, WT) and a double
mutant variant (W159H/S238F) (hereafter, DM) to understand
the implications of altering the active site of this mesophilic PET
hydrolase to more closely resemble that of a thermophilic
cutinase. Performance is compared across factors likely to
impact hydrolysis rate and conversion extent, including reaction
temperature, reaction mixture composition, agitation during
hydrolysis, enzyme loading, substrate loading, and product
accumulation. These studies highlight the impacts of reaction
conditions on catalytic performance, where reaction rates,
substrate specificity, and inhibition can be significantly different
even for two closely related enzymes. This has important
implications for the development of PET-active biocatalysts,
especially when considering enzyme screening strategies for
process-relevant PET hydrolases.

Results
Structural and biophysical comparison of the W159H/S238F
variant of IsPETase reveals conformational and stability
changes compared to the WT
To compare structural differences between the WT and DM, a
high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the DM was solved
with diffraction data extending to a resolution of 1.45 Å (PDB
ID: 7OSB) (Figure 1, Figure S1, Table S1). The two amino acid
substitutions (W159H/S238F) (Figure 1) in the DM induce
narrowing of the active site cleft (Figure 1B) compared to the
WT enzyme (PDB ID: 6EQE)
[6]
(Figure 1E), and otherwise result in
minimal conformational changes to the structure (Figure S2).
Despite the small change in overall structure, these point
mutations have a marked effect on the thermal stability of the
DM enzyme relative to the WT (Figure 1D, Figure S3). The
apparent T
m
of the WT is 46.76 � 0.04 ° C, measured by differ-
ential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while the apparent T
m
of the
DM is 56.49 � 0.22 ° C (Figure 1D). In comparing the thermody-
namic stability (resistance to thermal unfolding) of each enzyme
as a function of temperature, the WT and DM enzymes have
comparable stability at 30 ° C (Figure S3A). As the temperature
increases, the relative stability of the DM compared to the WT
increases, reaching a maximum relative difference in stability at
47 ° C (Figure S3B). At 47 ° C, the WT has a 19 fold increased
propensity for thermal denaturation compared to the DM at the
same temperature.
Substrates used in this study include amorphous and
crystalline PET
The primary PET substrates utilized for all studies include an
amorphous film (2.0 � 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented
film (30.7 � 5.5 % crystallinity), and a crystalline powder (37.7 �
2.6 % crystallinity), all sourced from Goodfellow, unless noted
otherwise. Detailed characterization of each substrate used in
these studies was performed (Table S2).
[9a]
DMSO in the reaction mixture promotes conversion of
amorphous PET film
PET hydrolysis reaction parameters reported in the literature
vary widely. In some studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is
included in the reaction
[3,4,6,11]
to promote solubility of liberated
monomers. In other studies, DMSO is not included,
[2a,b,7,12]
leading us to study the influence of DMSO on PET conversion.
Likewise, some studies have included agitation of the reaction
to facilitate mass transfer and promote association between the
enzyme and the substrate.
[12,13]
To understand if either inclusion
of DMSO in the reaction mixture or agitation of the reaction
during hydrolysis appreciably influence the extent of PET
conversion, we compared reactions over 96 h using both the
WT and DM incubated at 30 and 40 ° C (Figure 2, Figure S4). All
reactions were performed using 1 mg g
  1
enzyme loading and
2.9 % by mass (29 g L
  1
) substrate loading of an amorphous PET

performed using an incubated orbital shaker at 225 rpm.
In comparing product release between PET substrates, this
study highlights the impact of substrate selection on conversion
extent. For both enzymes in most reaction conditions, a 2–5
fold increase in total product release is measured for reactions
containing crystalline powder compared to the same mass
loading of an amorphous film (Figure 2). These results also
highlight that the WT and the DM have different temperature-
dependent activity profiles, where a change of 10 ° C in the
reaction temperature has a larger differential effect on catalytic
performance for the DM at 48 and 96 h reaction times.
In general, product release was highest in the presence of
DMSO, while agitation resulted in slightly less product release,
on average. Reactions without DMSO tended to reach a lower
PET conversion extent over 48 and 96 h, which is most apparent
for reactions with amorphous PET. The DM enzyme on
crystalline PET exhibits the least variation in PET conversion
across all four conditions tested (Figure 2G, H). As the + DMSO/-
Agitation condition generally resulted in the highest PET
conversion, all subsequent reactions presented subsequently
were performed using this reaction condition, unless noted
otherwise.
Reaction progress and endpoint analysis reveal differential
activity profiles for the WT and DM enzymes
Hydrolytic performance on PET was evaluated for the WT and
DM at 30 and 40 ° C to assess how the difference in apparent T
m
might influence the rate and extent of PET conversion. The
lower temperature is the isolation temperature of the host
organism
[3]
and the typical reaction temperature reported for
IsPETase activity. The higher temperature, which is below the
apparent T
m
of the WT, was selected to identify if increased
temperature would result in faster conversion.
Conversion extent was evaluated by substrate mass loss
and measurement of the aromatic monomers released [as the
sum of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and TPA]. The effect of
reaction temperature was examined over 168 h using two
enzyme loadings [0.2 mg enzyme g
  1
PET (Figure S5, Table S4)
and 1.0 mg enzyme g
  1
PET (Figure 3, Table S5)], and a
substrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L
  1
) of amorphous PET
film. The resulting trend in reaction progress curves is similar
for both enzymes at both enzyme loadings, where reactions
incubated at 40 ° C accumulate more aromatic product at early
time points (< 48 h) (Figure 3A). For the WT, at 40 ° C product
accumulation plateaus by 48 h, while at 30 ° C the enzyme
continues hydrolyzing amorphous PET film through the 168 h
timepoint. The DM exhibits low relative activity at 30 ° C, but at
40 ° C remains active through 168 h and accumulates the
highest total concentration of aromatic product monomer from
72 h onward.

and error bars represent the absolute error between replicates. Progress curves showing aromatic product release over 96 h are available for each dataset in

Catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity are improved at
40 ° C for both the WT and DM
In addition to conversion extent, we also evaluated initial rates
of hydrolysis for the WT and DM using the conventional
(convMM) and inverse (invMM) Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetic
models.
[14]
The convMM model examines reaction regimes in
which the substrate is present in great excess of the biocatalyst,
while the invMM model is a study with enzyme in excess of the
substrate. Given the nature of the insoluble PET substrates
hydrolyzed by these enzymes, achieving the conditions re-
quired for the convMM reactions is not trivial, and therefore we
explored both kinetic models. Using the kinetic parameters
derived from these models, we can compare the performance
of each enzyme by comparing affinity between the enzyme and
the substrate (
conv
K
m
, Equation S1 and
inv
K
m
, Equation S2) and
maximal reaction velocity (
conv
V
max
, Equation S3 and
inv
V
max
,
Equation S4).
Specifically, sacrificial samples were generated for each time
point over a reaction time of 6–10 h (while initial reaction rates
remain linear). Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting
for both enzymes at 30 and 40 ° C on two different PET
substrates, amorphous PET film and a crystalline PET powder.
Initial rate measurements were collected for the convMM
dataset (Figure 4, Table 1) using 950 nm enzyme and varying
the substrate loading over a range of 0–11.6 % by mass (0–
116 g L
  1
) to identify a saturating substrate load, or when
substrate is sufficiently in excess that all enzymes in the
reaction are engaged. Initial rate measurements were also
collected for the invMM dataset (Figure 5, Table 1) using a
substrate loading of 2.9 % by mass (29 g L
  1
) and varying the
enzyme loading over a range of 0–2 mg enzyme per g PET
Figure 3. Reaction progress analysis and endpoint analysis comparing the WT and DM IsPETase enzymes across reaction temperatures. Sacrificial samples
were generated for each timepoint. Each reaction contains 1 mg enzyme g

PET and 2.9 % amorphous PET film by mass (29 g L

). Reactions were evaluated
for 168 h to compare enzyme stability. (A) Progress curves show variation in total aromatic product release over time for each condition evaluated. (B) Three
different endpoint analyses, at 24, 96, and 168 h provide three different performance comparisons between the WT and DM. There is no significant difference
in product release between WT-30 ° C and DM-40 ° C reactions at both 24 and 96 h according to 2-way ANOVA multiple comparison. Additional statistical
analysis information is in Table S6. Error bars represent the standard deviation of reactions performed in triplicate. Datasets for these plots are in Dataset S2.

(corresponding to 0–1.9 μm enzyme) to identify a saturating
enzyme load. The data are generally well-represented by the
conventional (Equation S1) and inverse (Equation S2) MM
equations (Figures 4 and 5). An exception to the conventional
MM model is observed in the case of WT-40 ° C on crystalline
PET powder (Figure 4B). At 40 ° C, the WT showed the expected
behavior at low substrate loadings, but turnover rate decreases
at higher substrate loadings (Figure 4B), leading to a poor fit of
Equation S1 (Figure S6, Table S7). This behavior was not
observed in previous interfacial kinetics studies using the same
substrate;
[15]
however, in those studies only the DM was tested
and the substrate loadings evaluated were much lower,
encompassing 0–0.6 % loading by mass (0–6 g L
  1
PET). Data for
the convMM plots using WT-40 ° C on crystalline powder were
fitted until the drop in turnover rate, from 0–58 g L
  1
PET
loading (Figure 4B).
The convMM and invMM datasets for each enzyme/temper-
ature combination are in accord, showing that reaction
velocities for the WT and DM are higher on the crystalline
powder, except in the case of the DM at 30 ° C. This increased
reaction velocity is likely due to the higher surface area of the
powder, and therefore increased availability of reaction sites. It
is important to note that the powder is more crystalline
(Table S2), and previous studies suggest that the amorphous
regions of the polymer are preferentially depolymerized by PET
hydrolases.
[16]
Regardless, the WT and DM generally show higher
affinity (based on
conv
K
m
values) and catalytic efficiency (based
on the specificity constant =
conv
k
cat
/
conv
K
m
, Table S8) for the
powder substrate compared to the amorphous film. Compar-
ison of derived kinetic parameters from the convMM datasets
(Table 1) reveals that while there is variation in catalytic rate
(k
cat
) across enzymes, temperatures, and substrates, the range is
not overly large. This is unexpected, given the increase in
reaction temperature.
[17]
Rather, there is a large variation in
conv
K
m
across enzymes and temperatures. The
conv
K
m
values drop
significantly between the 30 and 40 ° C reactions for both
enzymes on both substrates, indicating there is a temperature
dependence for affinity between the enzyme and the substrate.
On amorphous film, the specificity constant of the WT
incubated at 30 ° C is comparable to the DM incubated at 30 ° C,
and similarly WT-40 ° C is comparable to the DM-40 ° C (Table S8).
On crystalline PET powder, however, the WT has much higher
specificity than the DM at both temperatures (Table S8).
Comparison of the derived kinetic parameters from the
invMM datasets (Table 1) shows that WT requires less enzyme
to reach saturation on amorphous PET. As one might expect, on

parameter is between 5 and 20 fold higher on powder
compared to film. The reactive site density, Γ, provides the
concentration of reactive sites available per g of substrate
(calculated values for Γ are in Table S8). Notably, the reactive
site density calculated for the WT on crystalline powder is
higher than the DM on the same substrate.
Kinetic parameters derived from initial rates are not
predictive of reaction productivity over longer reaction times
Substrate loading, extent of conversion, residence time, and
enzyme loading are key performance metrics that drive process
cost for enzymatic PET recycling.
[9b]
Evaluation of reaction
productivity as a function of enzyme loading and substrate
loading can thus help identify optimal process conditions. To
that end, we measured product release over 96 h for the WT
enzyme at 30 and 40 ° C and for the DM enzyme at 40 ° C,
evaluating the impact of substrate loading and enzyme loading
on performance over three productivity measures: the rate of
aromatic product release over a designated reaction duration
(24 h in Figure 6A, D, G, 10 and 48 h in Figures S7 and S8), the
rate of product release per unit of enzyme (Figure 6B, E, H), and
percent conversion of the initial substrate (Figure 6C, F, I). All
reactions used crystalline powder, substrate loadings of 2.9–
23.2 % by mass (29–232 g L
  1
), and enzyme loadings of 0.5–
3 mg enzyme per g PET.
For optimization of total product release per unit of time,
evaluation of the reactions at 24 h shows that increasing the
substrate loading and the enzyme loading yields the highest
concentrations of product release per hour (Figure 6A, D, G).
Performance was also evaluated at 10 and 48 h to evaluate
different reaction times (Figures S7–S9). For all three reaction
durations analyzed (10–48 h), the DM at 40 ° C showed the
highest overall product release rate (Figure 6G, Figures S7 and
S8).
For optimization of product release rate per unit of enzyme
in the reaction, after 24 h reaction time, two trends are
observed. Reactions at 40 ° C are optimized at high enzyme
loadings and low substrate loadings (Figure 6E, H). In contrast,

the WT incubated at 30 ° C shows its highest hydrolytic rates at
the lowest enzyme loading evaluated (0.5 mg enzyme per g
PET) (Figure 6B). The DM enzyme incubated at 40 ° C demon-
strates the highest product release rates per mg of enzyme
measured in this comparison at high enzyme loadings (2–3 mg
enzyme per g PET) and the lowest substrate loading (29 g L
  1
)
(Figure 6H).
For optimization of the reaction based on substrate
conversion, unsurprisingly, low solids loading and high enzyme
loading result in the highest percent of depolymerization of the
substrate for all reaction conditions tested (Figure 6C, F, I).
Again, the DM at 40 ° C demonstrates the highest overall
conversion of the 29 g L
  1
substrate samples (Figure 6I).
Increased PET conversion correlates with increased PET film
crystallinity until a crystallinity threshold
Enzyme specificity as it relates to substrate crystallinity is a key
economic and sustainability driver for biological PET
hydrolysis.
[9b]
Improved rates (Table 1) and conversion extents
(Figure 2) were observed for crystalline PET powder compared
to amorphous PET film. To decouple the influence of increased
solvent accessible surface area from the influence of substrate
crystallinity in these observations, we examined product release
using PET films with the same surface area and varying
crystallinity. Conversion extent after 96 h was measured using
an amorphous film (2.0 � 1.6 % crystallinity), a biaxially oriented
film (30.7 � 5.5 % crystallinity), and annealed films with crystal-
linities ranging from 3.0 � 1.7 to 25.1 � 1.8 % (Figure 7, Fig-
ure S10A, Table S9). In general, conversion extent after 96 h
increased as crystallinity increased until the percent crystallinity
crossed a threshold around 20 % (Figure 7). Samples with 16.4 �
1.2 % crystallinity show the highest product release, while a
highly crystalline annealed film (25.1 � 1.8 %) and the biaxially
oriented film (30.7 � 5.5 %) demonstrate low conversion extents
(Figure 7).
WT and DM enzymes display different sensitivities to
accumulation of depolymerization products
High extents of conversion will result in the accumulation of
high concentrations of product monomer. To understand how
monomer accumulation influences IsPETase, we first investi-
gated the influence of monomer accumulation on BHET
hydrolysis over a timescale that affords complete or near-
complete substrate conversion. Using an initial substrate
concentration of 2.25 mm BHET and 50 nm of the WT or DM,
conversion was monitored over 18 h at 30 ° C (Figure 8). For the
WT, 12.0 � 1.1 % of the initial substrate concentration remains
after 18 h (Figure 8A), while for the DM only 1.4 � 0.2 % remains
(Figure 8D). To test the hypothesis that the WT is more
susceptible to slowed hydrolysis due to accumulation of MHET,
we next tested the same reaction scenario with both IsPETase
and IsMHETase (50 nm each). With both enzymes present, the
WT retains only 4.34 � 0.4 % of the initial substrate (Figure 8B),
while the DM in the presence of MHETase retains 27.9 � 0.5 % of
the initial substrate (Figure 8E), suggesting the DM is more
susceptible to a slowed rate of hydrolysis with accumulated
TPA.
To distinguish whether the effect of slowed hydrolysis was
influenced by accumulating monomer or the presence of the
second enzyme, we also evaluated how BHET hydrolysis was
influenced by an initial concentration of monomer (1.25 mm
MHET, TPA, or EG) in addition to the initial substrate concen-
tration of 2.25 mm BHET. Over 18 h for the WT, BHET hydrolysis
is slowed in the presence of excess MHET and EG, relative to
the reaction containing only BHET. BHET hydrolysis is slightly
improved in the presence of excess TPA (Figure 8C). For the
DM, however, all three product monomers (MHET, TPA, and EG)
slow the rate of BHET hydrolysis over 18 h (Figure 8F).
We subsequently investigated if accumulation of product
monomers exhibits a similar effect on conversion of amorphous
PET film over 96 h, again by initiating reactions in the presence
of product (1.25 mm BHET, MHET, TPA, or EG) along with the
PET film (2.9 % by mass or 29 g L
  1
). Reactions containing
1 mg g
  1
enzyme loading were evaluated for product release,
accounting for the initial concentration of product monomer
(Figure 9). For the WT incubated at 30 ° C, product release is
increased in the presence of TPA, and slowed by the
accumulation of MHET and EG over time, relative to reactions
containing only PET film (Figure 9A). For the DM, simulated
accumulation of MHET had little effect on product release at 30
or 40 ° C (Figure 9B, C). Simulated accumulation of TPA and EG
show reduced product release at 30 and 40 ° C (Figure 9B, C). To
ensure the enzyme is not destabilized in the presence of EG or
TPA, we also measured the thermal stability of both the WT and
DM under increasing concentrations of each product. The
apparent T
m
did not change significantly in the presence of
either monomer for concentrations ranging from 0–4 mm
(Figure S12), indicating no denaturation or destabilization of the

Discussion
Enzymatic hydrolysis of waste PET holds promise for addressing
accumulation of this abundant polyester. Accordingly, the
major focus of enzymatic PET hydrolysis studies to date has
been identification and engineering of new enzymes to this
end. To address real waste streams at scale using an enzymatic
recycling technology, additional process factors will be critical.
Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of such a
process indicates that substrate loading, extent of depolymeri-
zation, reaction residence time, enzyme loading, and enzyme
cost are all within the top 10 process considerations impacting
the cost.
[9b]
Tolerance to product inhibition, specificity for the
array of possible substrate morphologies (including high
crystallinity substrates), and stability over the reaction residence
time are also important considerations for minimizing process
cost, and represent important challenges and opportunities for
additional prospecting, characterization, and engineering of
PET-hydrolyzing enzymes.
In this study, we compare the WT and a DM variant of the
PET-hydrolyzing enzyme from I. sakaiensis across multiple
factors that drive process costs, highlighting the effects these
reaction variables can have on performance. For example, while
the WT enzyme demonstrates high specificity for PET films
under ambient conditions, there are limitations in enzyme
stability (Figure 3). Techno-economic analysis of a modeled
enzymatic PET recycling process shows that varying temper-
ature (40–80 ° C) imparts no change to process costs. In contrast,
reaction residence time and enzyme price, both of which would
be influenced by an unstable enzyme, contribute substantially
to minimum selling price of the product.
[9b]
Not only will structural and biophysical properties of the
biocatalyst determine catalytic performance, but structural and
physical properties of the substrate are also critical variables to
consider.
[13b,16e]
We observe a range of catalytic activity depend-
ing on the characteristics of the substrate, as demonstrated
using the annealed PET films of varying crystallinity (Figure 7,
Figure S10). Both the WT and DM demonstrate a clear
preference for more crystalline substrates, a trait that has not
been reported for other PET-active enzymes. In the case of
Figure 8. Accumulation of monomers influences extent of BHET hydrolysis at 30 ° C. BHET hydrolysis was evaluated at 30 ° C over 18 h reaction time using
50 nm of WT or DM PETase, or 50 nm WT or DM PETase and 50 nm MHETase. All reactions used a starting concentration of 2.25 mm BHET in reaction buffer.
(A) BHET hydrolysis by the WT yields primarily MHET. Conversion of the initial 2.25 mm BHET supplied in the reaction is incomplete over 18 h reaction time.
(B) Combining PETase WT and MHETase in the reaction increases extent of BHET conversion over 18 h. (C) Product accumulation for each of the constituent
monomers is simulated by addition of 1.25 mm starting concentration to the initial BHET substrate. Bar graph shows % of initial BHET concentration remaining
over 18 h reaction. In the presence of excess MHET (green) and EG (purple), the WT shows slower hydrolysis of BHET compared to the reactions containing
BHET only. In the presence of excess TPA (blue), BHET hydrolysis is faster than reactions containing BHET only. (D) BHET hydrolysis by the DM yields primarily
MHET. Conversion of the initial 2.25 mm BHET is nearly complete by 18 h. (E) Combining DM and MHETase in the reaction mixture yields primarily TPA.
Accumulation of TPA appears to slow the conversion of BHET over the 18 h reaction observed. (F) When product accumulation is simulated, addition of excess
MHET (green), TPA (blue), and EG (purple) all slow BHET hydrolysis by the DM compared to reactions containing only BHET. Panels A, B, D, and E represent
datasets with a sample size of n = 6. Experiments in panels C and F were performed in triplicate. Error bars show the standard deviation across independent
samples. Progress curves showing analyte concentrations for all datasets represented in panels C and F are shown in Figure S11. Figure datasets provided in

crystalline powder, the substrate also presents a high surface
area, so continued work to deconvolute the influence of surface
area and crystallinity on reaction rate and substrate affinity is
worthwhile. In particular, it would be interesting to identify if
PETase has a higher specificity for crystalline PET compared to
other PET hydrolases, because while some enzymes have
demonstrated remarkable hydrolytic activity on amorphized
PET,
[1e]
far better than any activities reported for PETase or its
variants, efficient degradation of highly crystalline substrates
remains a key opportunity in the development of robust and
cost-effective enzymatic depolymerization systems.
[9b]
To further explain the differences observed between the WT
and DM, it seems unlikely that the increased thermal stability of
the DM is the primary driver of improved performance, as the
DM enzyme at 30 ° C shows the poorest performance, despite
improved stability. It seems equally unlikely that a possible
increase in PET polymer flexibility at 40 ° C is the primary driver
of improved performance, as the WT at 30 ° C demonstrates
nearly as good performance as the DM at 40 ° C, still well below
the PET T
g
. The steady-state kinetic parameters derived from
the convMM and invMM models suggest there is an important
temperature-dependent change in affinity between the enzyme
and the substrate at 40 ° C, perhaps indicating that association
between the enzyme and the substrate is better at 40 ° C, but
this is true for both enzymes. A temperature-dependent
improvement in association between the polyester chain and
the enzyme could explain this phenomenon, but whether that
is due to increased flexibility of the polyester, or a conforma-
tional change of the enzyme is yet unknown.
Study of enzymes with specificity to PET has led to
important discoveries about the catalytic mechanisms
[4]
and
structural properties of the enzymes. Extending these discov-
eries to facilitate comparative biochemistry requires a balance
of functional assessment and elucidation of meaningful kinetic
parameters.
[14]
Functional assessment is critical for process
development, uncovering relationships between time-depend-
ence, dose-dependence, and conversion extent. Structure-
function relationships, however, are traditionally studied
through the comparison of kinetic parameters based on initial
reaction rates. For either methodology of comparison, without
consistent reaction conditions, direct comparisons between
studies are challenging. In this study, we consider both
approaches for comparing the WT and DM.
The typical model employed for derivation of kinetic
parameters is based on the conventional MM theory. For
interfacial biocatalysts, however, the applicability of this con-
ventional model to reactions taking place at the interface of a
solid substrate and aqueous media remains controversial,
[14]
specifically regarding the assumption that substrate be avail-
able in great excess relative to the enzyme concentration. To
address the limited applicability of the conventional MM model
for interfacial reactions, an alternative model has been
proposed that instead looks at reaction regimes with a large
excess of available enzyme, coined an “inverse” MM model.
[14,15]
This model has previously been applied to PET-hydrolyzing
enzymes.
[15]
In contrast to our observations, the previous interfacial
kinetics study of the PETase DM showed that initial reaction
rates declined in response to increased enzyme loading in the
invMM reaction regime.
[15]
A hypothesis was proposed to
suggest that “overcrowding” of active and/or denatured
enzyme at the surface of the substrate, in combination with a
reduction in the number of available reactive sites due to fast
turnover of the substrate would lead to this inhibition
behavior.
[15]
If limitation in surface accessibility were the primary
cause, this inhibition behavior would be expected to occur
more markedly on substrates with less surface area accessible,
such as films, but that behavior is not apparent in the studies
presented here.
With regard to satisfying the requirements of the conven-
tional MM model, we selected an enzyme loading consistent
with other experiments from this study, which also corresponds
to the midpoint of the enzyme loadings using for the invMM
experiment. This enzyme loading may have been too high to
satisfy the requirements of the convMM model. From a
“concentration” perspective, PET monomers comprising the

addition of 1.25 mm monomer to the reaction mixture along with
amorphous PET film substrate. Aromatic product accumulation over 96 h is

initial substrate load are in great excess of the enzyme, however
we do not know the relative concentration of available reaction
sites for these solid substrates a priori. The implications of this
are that if the enzyme concentration is too high for the
convMM dataset, at all solids loadings we observe here, the
substrate is saturated with enzyme, and the requirement that
substrate be in great excess is not met. For reference, the
previous study
[15]
to look at initial reaction rates for PET
hydrolysis used 30 nm enzyme loading (relative to 950 nm used
in this study), but solids loadings up to only 0.6 % (relative to
11.6 % in this study). While this study uses approximately
30 times the enzyme concentration of the previous study, it
also explores solids loadings of approximately 20 times higher
as well. Despite the differences in experimental design, we

when using the same enzyme, same substrate, and same
temperature.
The kinetic parameters derived from these studies should
allow one to compare performance of various enzymes,
especially with regard to establishing structure-function rela-
tionships. The potential for performance based on the first
moments or hours of a reaction, however, is not always
reflective of functional performance. Based on the kinetic
parameters derived from these studies, we would conclude that
WT-40 ° C is the superior enzyme/temperature combination,
however the WT is less stable at 40 ° C and the lifetime of this
performance is limited relative to using the same enzyme at a
lower temperature. Similarly, employing the DM at 40 ° C, where
it can maintain stability for longer, also allows for more PET
conversion using the same amount of enzyme.
For any enzymatic process, but certainly for enzymatic
reactions performed at an industrial scale, loss of catalytic
performance due to inhibition can have a significant impact on
process costs. Both the WT and DM enzymes show slowed rates
of hydrolysis upon accumulation of product monomers. Each
enzyme has a different inhibition sensitivity profile, which is
somewhat unexpected. While we see potentially significant
impacts of product inhibition at the small scale, we do not
know if the influence is still significant at large scale. It is also an
open question if the product accumulation profile and inhib-
ition sensitivity profile might change in a pH-controlled reaction
relative to the small-volume closed-system reactions we have
presented here.
[16b]
Conclusion
By evaluating the catalytic performance of the wild-type and
double mutant IsPETase across several critical variables, we
observe important and surprising differences between these
closely related enzymes. This study highlights the importance
of understanding and optimizing reaction variables that drive
process cost from a holistic perspective, rather than focusing on
individual characteristics of a biocatalyst.
