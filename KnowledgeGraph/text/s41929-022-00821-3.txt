P
oly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is among the most abun -
dantly produced synthetic polymers. Demand for this mate -
rial has grown substantially due to a heightened global 
appetite for convenient single-use containers 1,2, with an estimated 
1 million PET bottles being produced every minute 3. Although 
mechanical recycling methods are available for PET, recycling 
rates remain low due to difficulties in collecting and sorting mixed 
postconsumer waste streams 4,5, and declining polymer properties 
after repeated processing cycles6. In light of these challenges, depo-
lymerization of PET into its component monomers has attracted 
interest as a means of circularizing the PET life cycle7,8. This can be 
achieved using chemical recycling techniques, including solvolysis 
methods such as hydrolysis and glycolysis
9,10. More recently, enzy-
matic depolymerizations have emerged as a potentially attractive 
alternative
7,8. Techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessments 
predict that biocatalysis can offer a cost-effective and energy effi -
cient approach to PET recycling. Furthermore, enzymatic recy -
cling could also facilitate selective depolymerizations of complex 
mixed feedstock waste streams that are particularly challenging to 
recycle effectively.
For enzymatic PET recycling to be feasible, suitable biocatalysts 
must first be discovered and then engineered to tailor their prop
-
erties for target applications. Unfortunately, while microorganisms 
are extremely well-equipped to deconstruct biological polymers 
such as proteins, DNA and carbohydrates, they are generally not 
well-adapted to achieve efficient depolymerization of synthetic 
polymers
11. Nevertheless, some cutinases have been shown to have 
promiscuous PET degradation abilities 12–15. These enzymes typi -
cally display poor activity towards PET materials with high crys -
tallinities, akin to those commonly found in postconsumer waste.  
To function effectively, even engineered cutinases require the extensive  
preprocessing of PET substrates to amorphize the material16, a pro-
cess that compromises the economic and environmental sustain -
ability of biocatalytic plastic recycling approaches17.
The recent discovery of an organism, Ideonella sakaiensis , 
with the ability to use PET as a carbon source 18, revealed a natu -
rally evolved, PET-hydrolysing enzyme (Is PETaseWT) that has an 
enhanced ability to depolymerize more crystalline forms of PET18,19. 
There are interesting structural differences between Is PETase and 
homologous cutinases, which are thought to be linked to this 
improved activity19, including a conformationally flexible Trp185 
that has been proposed to aid polymer binding 20,21. The unique 
catalytic properties of IsPETase make it an attractive candidate as a 
biocatalyst for PET recycling. Unfortunately, the wild-type enzyme 
suffers from low thermostability
18, meaning that biotransformations 
must be run at ambient temperatures far below the glass transition 
temperature (T g) of PET (T g of approximately 60–70 °C), which 
compromises polymer deconstruction rates22,23.
In an effort to address these limitations, improvements in PETase 
stability have been achieved using a variety of rational engineering 
approaches19,24–27. In contrast, experimental optimization of IsPETase 
using directed evolution, which typically offers a more comprehen-
sive approach to enzyme engineering 28,29, remains under-explored, 
probably due to the lack of suitable protocols for monitoring the 
deconstruction of insoluble plastics with sufficient throughput 30. 
Here we establish an automated, high-throughput directed evolu -
tion platform for engineering plastic deconstructing enzymes and 
showcase its use by engineering a thermostable variant of IsPETase 
that can operate at the glass transition temperature of PET. This 
engineered biocatalyst can efficiently depolymerize semicrystalline 
PET and can selectively deconstruct real-world laminated packag
-
ing materials.

The recent discovery of IsPET ase, a hydrolytic enzyme that can deconstruct poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), has sparked 
great interest in biocatalytic approaches to recycle plastics. Realization of commercial use will require the development of 
robust engineered enzymes that meet the demands of industrial processes. Although rationally engineered PET ases have been 
described, enzymes that have been experimentally optimized via directed evolution have not previously been reported. Here, 
we describe an automated, high-throughput directed evolution platform for engineering polymer degrading enzymes. Applying 
catalytic activity at elevated temperatures as a primary selection pressure, a thermostable IsPET ase variant (HotPET ase, 
T
m = 82.5 °C) was engineered that can operate at the glass transition temperature of PET. HotPET ase can depolymerize 
semicrystalline PET more rapidly than previously reported PET ases and can selectively deconstruct the PET component of a 
laminated multimaterial. Structural analysis of HotPET ase reveals interesting features that have emerged to improve thermo-
tolerance and catalytic performance. Our study establishes laboratory evolution as a platform for engineering useful plastic 
degrading enzymes.

Directed evolution of a thermostable PETase. We selected a 
rationally designed, thermostabilized variant of Is PETase contain-
ing three mutations, S121E, D186H, R280A (Is PETaseTS, melting 
temperature (Tm) of 56.8 °C),24 as a starting point for engineering. 
Consistent with previous reports, IsPETaseTS displays superior PET 
degradation activity compared to the wild-type enzyme at 40 °C; 
however, this activity decreases dramatically at more elevated tem -
peratures (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Our first objective was to develop a high-throughput screening 
workflow to underpin the directed evolution study. To this end, indi-
vidual enzyme variants were evaluated as crude cell lysates arrayed 
in 96-deep-well plates, using amorphous PET film (amoPET, 6.7% 
crystallinity, sourced from Goodfellow as a preform sheet) as the 
reaction substrate. The amoPET substrate allowed us to prepare 
uniform 6 mm diameter discs that could be easily placed into indi
-
vidual wells to allow fair comparison of variant activity (Fig. 1). We 
found that the addition of our standard chemical cell lysis reagents, 
lysozyme and polymyxin B, resulted in the production of a lysate 
with substantially reduced activity (Supplementary Fig. 2), hence, we 
developed a method for 96-well plate cell lysis using the commercial 
reagent, BugBuster. The accumulation of mono(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalate (MHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) in the reaction 
supernatant was monitored by ultra performance liquid chroma
-
tography (UPLC); these two products result from the partial and 
complete hydrolysis of the PET backbone, respectively, and are 
the known major products of Is PETase-mediated depolymeriza
-
tions18,31. Using the UPLC method developed here, the MHET and 
TPA produced by a single degradation reaction can be analysed 
in under 2 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using our integrated, 
automated system, over 2,000 enzyme variants can be assessed for 
plastic deconstruction activity in around 2 days.
The evolutionary strategy comprised sequential rounds of satu
-
ration mutagenesis, using degenerate NNK codons to individually 
randomize between 24–30 residue positions per cycle. In total, 106 
of the 264 residues present in Is PETase were targeted for mutation 
throughout evolution. Residues were selected for randomization on 
the basis of a number of considerations, including their identifica
-
tion by online protein stability-enhancing tools, visual inspection 
of the protein crystal structure or previous reports of their involve
-
ment in substrate binding or thermostability (Supplementary Table 
1). In each round of evolution, around the top 3% of hits were 
assessed as purified enzymes. Beneficial mutations found were then 
combined by DNA shuffling, and the resulting variants assayed as 
purified proteins to identify the most active sequence, which was 
then used as a template for the next round of evolution. Between

Fig. 1 | Workflow for the directed evolution of a PET depolymerase. Depiction of the laboratory evolution workflow for a single well in a 96-deep-well 
plate. Enzymatic PEt depolymerizations mainly produce MHEt, tPA and ethylene glycol (EG). the example UPLC trace demonstrates the MHEt and tPA 
produced following a 5 h PEt degradation reaction of semicrystalline PEt powder (cryPEt), with absorbance on the y axis in milli-absorbance units (mAu) 
and retention time on the x axis in minutes (min). Reactions were carried out at 70 °C, with both the best variant following evolution, HotPEtase (pink), 
and the starting protein IsPEtase
tS (yellow) using 0.4% cryPEt substrate loading (4 g l−1) and 0.29 mg g−1 enzyme loading (0.04 μM). the crystal structure 
shows the 21 amino acid positions mutated from IsPEtaseWt: three positions mutated in the starting protein IsPEtasetS (yellow spheres), 16 installed 
through evolution (pink spheres) and a rationally installed disulfide bridge (black spheres). the catalytic triad and W185 are shown with a ball and stick 
representation in blue and grey, respectively.

rounds 2 and 3, an additional disulfide bridge (N233C, S282C) was 
rationally generated in the protein, following reports that the inclu-
sion of this structural feature increased protein stability in homolo-
gous, promiscuous PET-degrading cutinases16,32, leading to a 5.5 °C 
increase in Tm (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).
To simultaneously improve both thermostability and activity, 
the evolutionary pressures applied were gradually changed across 
rounds by raising both the reaction temperature and extending the 
reaction time. For rounds 1–4, the primary focus was on improved 
catalysis at elevated temperatures. Cell lysates were pre-incubated 
at sequentially higher temperatures (from 55–75 °C) for 1 h, before 
conducting PET depolymerization reactions for 3 h. The reaction 
temperature also increased from 55–70 °C during these rounds 
(Supplementary Table 1). Once a satisfactory level of thermostabil
-
ity was achieved, additional selection pressures of catalyst longevity 
and activity on more crystalline material were added. To this end, 
reactions in rounds 5 and 6 were conducted at 70 °C, with reaction 
times of 5 and 7 h, respectively, initially using amoPET as the sub
-
strate. The top 3% of clones identified during rounds 5 and 6 were 
then screened as purified enzymes against a commercially available 
semicrystalline PET powder (cryPET, 29.8% crystallinity, sourced 
from Goodfellow) that has a crystallinity level more reminiscent of 
material dominant in postconsumer waste streams
33,34.
The most thermostable and active variant to emerge following six 
rounds of evolution, HotPETase, contains 21 mutations compared 
to IsPETaseWT: three from the starting protein template IsPETaseTS, 
two from the rational insertion of an additional disulfide bridge and 
a further 16 found through directed evolution (Fig. 1 and Extended 
Data Fig. 1). HotPETase has a melting temperature of 82.5 °C, the 
highest Tm recorded so far of an active Is PETase derivative. This 
elevated thermostability means that the enzyme can be incubated 
before reaction at 75 °C for 90 min with only a 6% loss of activity 
over 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 4). Enzyme pre-incubation at 80 °C 
for 90 min resulted in a more substantial 35% reduction in activity. 
Assessment of variants along the evolutionary trajectory demon -
strated that evolution led to progressive improvements in both ther-
mostability and activity in cryPET deconstruction assays performed 
at 60 °C (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). While Is PETase
WT and 
IsPETaseTS have minimal activity at 60 °C, HotPETase operated well 
under these conditions.
Biochemical characterization. We next determined the activity 
of HotPETase across a range of temperatures by monitoring the 
release of MHET and TPA over time (Fig. 2b). For comparison, 
analogous experiments were performed using the starting template, 
IsPETase
TS, and the engineered thermostable cutinase LCC ICCG  
(ref. 16). Comparisons between LCCICCG and IsPETase variants were 
carried out under the optimal buffer conditions for each individual 
protein16,18, using cryPET powder as the substrate (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). At 40 °C, slightly improved initial reaction rates were 
achieved by HotPETase versus IsPETaseTS (Fig. 2b), demonstrating 
that the evolution of thermostability has not compromised activity at 
ambient temperatures. While the activity of IsPETase
TS was severely 
compromised at higher temperatures, the rate of PET hydrolysis by 
HotPETase is substantially improved by operating at temperatures 
approaching the reported T
g of PET in aqueous solutions (around 
60–65 °C)14. At 65 °C, each mole of HotPETase releases 2.7 × 104 M 
of monomers in 1 hour, a time-course over which reaction progres-
sion is linear. At the same temperature LCC ICCG produced 5.7 × 103 
moles of monomer product in the same time frame, highlighting 
the superior catalytic activity of this engineered IsPETase. For both 
HotPETase and LCCICCG, the reaction rates were slightly reduced at 
70 versus 65 °C.
Comparison of reactions with HotPETase and Is PETaseTS at 
40 °C show that evolution has afforded a more robust catalyst 
with increased longevity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2). For 
IsPETaseTS, soluble product formation essentially ceases after 8 h. In 
contrast, for reactions with HotPETase, monomeric products con -
tinue to accumulate for more than 48 h. Consistent with previous 
studies26, the reaction profile is non-linear with faster initial phase 
for roughly 8 h, followed by a slower phase from 8–48 h. Similar, 
but more pronounced, non-linear reaction profiles are observed at 
elevated temperatures (from 60–70 °C, Extended Data Fig. 2). The 
time-course of reactions with HotPETase at 65 °C demonstrate that 
product accumulation rises rapidly for the first of 3 h of reaction 
(1.51 mM of MHET + TPA), but then slows substantially after this 
time, producing 1.61 mM of soluble monomers over 48 h (Fig. 2d). 
As a result, while PET depolymerization with HotPETase is substan-
tially faster at 65 °C, the extent of depolymerization at longer time 
frames is greater at 40 °C (Fig. 2c,d).
Product accumulation over time is also non-linear for LCCICCG in 
reactions at 65 °C, with 0.68 and 1.78 mM of monomers produced 
over 5 and 48 h, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3). It is interest -
ing to note that HotPETase operating at 40 °C deconstructs cry -
PET more efficiently than LCC ICCG at 65 °C, both with respect to 
initial rate and extent of depolymerization over 48 h. HotPETase 
also depolymerizes amoPET discs (used for library screening) more 
effectively than LCC
ICCG across a range of temperatures from 40 to 
65 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6). At 70 °C, although HotPETase pro -
duces more soluble monomers than LCC ICCG over 3 h, at this tem -
perature over 24 h, LCC ICCG is a more effective depolymerase of 
amoPET due to its enhanced longevity.
To understand the origins of the non-linear reaction profiles of 
HotPETase, particularly at elevated temperatures, we conducted 
experiments to supply additional enzyme or substrate once reaction 
progression had ceased. Addition of fresh HotPETase, following 
cryPET depolymerization for 24 h at 60 °C, leads to similar prod
-
uct accumulation versus time trends as observed at the outset of 
the reaction (Extended Data Fig. 4). In contrast, addition of fresh 
PET substrate does not give rise to any additional soluble products. 
These observations suggest that reactions stall due to catalyst deac
-
tivation, not as a result of inhibition by soluble released products or 
exhaustion of available plastic substrate. It is interesting to note that 
during evolution, IsPETase libraries were analysed over time frames 
ranging from 3 to 7 h, meaning that limited selection pressure was 
applied to catalyst longevity at elevated temperatures. We anticipate 
that adapting selection pressures during future rounds of evolution 
will lead to improved variants capable of operating efficiently at 
elevated temperatures for more extended periods.
To further explore the use of HotPETase, we next attempted 
to deconstruct commercial-grade PET materials. HotPETase can 
depolymerize milled bottle-grade PET (bgPET, 41.9% crystallinity, 
full material characterization can be found in Extended Data Table 1 
and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), albeit with a reduced conversion 
compared to that observed with cryPET powder (Fig. 3) (9.7 and 
2.8% with cryPET and bgPET, respectively). To showcase the selec
-
tivity achievable with biocatalytic depolymerizations, HotPETase 
was used to deconstruct a common laminated packaging tray lid 
composed of PET and polyethylene (PE) (1.6% crystallinity, thick
-
ness of 325 μm PET and 40 μm PE, Extended Data Table 1). This 
PET/PE laminate is challenging to recycle mechanically, and indeed 
is considered a pollutant in commercial recycling streams. The 
HotPETase enzyme is adept at selectively deconstructing the PET 
portion of this material. In this instance, the extent of depolymeriza
-
tion after 24 h is substantially improved at 60 versus 40 °C (9.2 versus 
2.9 mM of soluble monomer products released, corresponding to a 
degree of depolymerization of 48.1 and 15.3%, respectively, Fig. 3a  
and Extended Data Fig. 5). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
reveals significant pitting of the PET surface, whereas the PE sur
-
face appears unchanged, compared to control reactions run in the 
absence of enzyme (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9). The patterns 
of PET surface erosion differ in samples depolymerized at 40 versus

60 °C, with defined pits observed at 40 °C compared with a more 
rugged surface at the higher temperature (Supplementary Fig. 9).  
These differences could plausibly arise due to different rates and 
extents of polymer deconstruction at the two temperatures, or due 
to increased chain mobility at 60 versus 40 °C.
To improve the rate and extent of PET depolymerization achiev
-
able with HotPETase, we next optimized several reaction parameters 
including pH, reaction buffer, substrate loading and enzyme load
-
ing (Supplementary Figs. 10–12). Under optimal conditions using 
3.62 mg g
−1 HotPETase enzyme loading (0.5 μM) and cryPET as 
the substrate (0.4% cryPET substrate loading (4 g l−1), 20 mg total), 
6.07 mM of soluble monomer products were formed (MHET:TPA 
ratio of 1:0.29) within 5 h at 60 °C, corresponding to a degree of depo-
lymerization of 31% (Extended Data Fig. 6). Differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) analysis of samples before and after depolymer
-
ization show an overall increase in crystallinity from 29.8 to 41.7%, 
suggesting that HotPETase preferentially degrades the amorphous 
PET domains (Supplementary Fig. 13a and Extended Data Table 2). 
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis shows no substantive 
change in the molecular weight and dispersity of the remaining PET 
(Supplementary Fig. 13b), which may indicate that the enzyme oper
-
ates in an exo-cleavage fashion, depolymerizing individual polymer 
chains fully before chain transfer to a new macromolecule, thus retain
-
ing the original chain lengths in the bulk of the sample. Applying the 
optimized reaction conditions for cryPET depolymerization to alterna
-
tive PET materials (bgPET and PET/PE laminate film) fails to enhance 
the rate or extent of depolymerization at 60 °C (Extended Data Fig. 5), 
suggesting that optimal process conditions are highly dependent on 
the characteristics of the material undergoing deconstruction.
Structural analysis. To gain insights into the origins of HotPETase 
thermostability and its improved activity, the crystal structure 
of the enzyme was solved and refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å for 
comparison to the starting variant Is PETase
TS. The structures of 
HotPETase (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 7QVH) and IsPETaseTS (PDB 
6IJ6) superimpose well, with a root-mean-square-deviation of 
1.18 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In HotPETase, the disulfide bridge 
between the Cys233 and Cys282 pair is formed as intended, with 
an S–S interatomic distance of 2.03 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7b). 
 
The P181V mutation results in an additional hydrogen bond 
between Val181 and Leu199 leading to better packing of the central 
β-sheet region compared to IsPETase
TS (Extended Data Fig. 7c and 
Supplementary Fig. 14). Analysis of the surface charge distributions 
of HotPETase and Is PETase
TS reveals substantial changes, includ -
ing in the putative polymer binding cleft (Supplementary Fig. 15). 
Ensemble refinements of Is PETase
TS and HotPETase demonstrates 
that regions Ala183 to Asn190 and Cys203 to Leu216 have substan-
tially decreased flexibility in the evolved enzyme (Supplementary 
Fig. 16).
To understand how HotPETase interacts with PET oligomers, we 
performed in silico docking using distance restraints to the Ser160 
catalytic nucleophile and the backbone amides of the oxyanion hole 
(Tyr87 and Met161). The lowest energy docking pose is shown in 
Fig. 4a, with the PET oligomer (2-hydroxyethyl-(monohydroxyet
hyl terephthalate)
4, 4PET) occupying a shallow, extended binding 
cleft. The ‘wobbling’ tryptophan, Trp185, a feature that is thought 
to aid substrate binding and catalysis in the wild-type enzyme
20,35, 
is present as a single conformer in apo -HotPETase and is suitably 
positioned to accommodate the docked 4PET in a productive pose 
for catalysis (Fig. 4b). Extensive remodelling of the loop region con-
necting β7-α5, including introduction of a bulky Tyr214, leads to 
a new π-stacking interaction with Trp185 that restricts its confor -
mational freedom (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7d). A hydro -
gen bonding network involving Trp185, Tyr214 and the terminal 
hydroxyl group of 4PET also contributes to the stabilization of the 
docked oligomer within the binding cleft.

40 μm PE, estimated 12.6 g l−1 PEt substrate loading) was submerged in a fresh solution of 0.08 mg g−1 HotPEtase (0.04 μM) and pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH 
buffer with 4% BugBuster each day, leading to a 36.4% depolymerization of the PEt portion of the sample. the no enzyme control was treated in the 
same manner, but with no enzyme applied. SEM images for reactions at 60 °C are provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Five images were collected for each 
experiment, with those shown being representative of the set. Scale bar, 50 μm.

To explore the functional significance of the altered environ -
ment around Trp185 in HotPETase, residues installed in the β7–α5 
connecting loop during evolution were reverted back to the amino 
acids present in the wild-type enzyme (HotPETase K212N, E213S, 
Y214S (HotPETase
LR)). These modifications led to a substantial 
7.5 °C reduction in T m and compromised catalytic performance at 
elevated temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 8). Catalytic activity at 
low temperatures is minimally affected, suggesting that in the heav-
ily engineered HotPETase, the fixed conformation of Trp185 is not 
detrimental to catalysis. Combined, these results indicate that a flex
-
ible Trp185 is not a prerequisite for efficient PET deconstruction.
Conclusions
The catalytic performances of PETases have previously been 
improved through rational engineering using computational meth
-
ods, providing an important basis towards the development of com-
mercially viable PET depolymerases. However, the engineering of 
industrial biocatalysts is most commonly achieved through directed 
evolution. The notable lack of PETases engineered using laboratory 
evolution probably reflects the challenges of developing suitable 
high-throughput, quantitative methods for analysing the catalytic 
deconstruction of insoluble polymers. Here, we have developed 
an automated directed evolution platform for engineering plastic 
deconstructing enzymes and showcase its use through the develop
-
ment of an evolved thermostable PETase (HotPETase, Tm = 82.5 °C), 
that can operate at the glass transition temperature of PET and 
depolymerizes semicrystalline PET more rapidly than previously 
reported PETases. HotPETase is able to deconstruct commercial 
bottle-grade PET and can selectively deconstruct PET in a PET/
PE laminated packaging material, highlighting the potential ben
-
efits of enzymatic depolymerizations for real-world samples with 
minimal pretreatment or processing. Structural characterization 
of HotPETase highlights formation of the intended Cys233-Cys282 
disulfide bridge and improved packing of the central β-sheet region, 
which probably aids thermostability, alongside the presence of a sin
-
gle well-defined conformer of Trp185, indicating that flexibility of 
this tryptophan is not a prerequisite for effective catalysis. To maxi
-
mize the use of our platform moving forward, it will be important 
to interface our evolution methods with alternative strategies for 
augmenting biocatalyst function, including computationally guided 
engineering
36, introduction of polymer binding domains 37 and the 
development of multienzyme complexes38. Likewise, combining and 
optimizing biocatalytic deconstructions with enzymatic monomer 
upcycling methods will be an important avenue for exploration39,40. 
In all cases, detailed techno-economic and life-cycle analysis will 
play a crucial role in assessing commercial viability, as well as defin-
ing target parameters for future biocatalyst engineering7,8.
In the future, we anticipate that by adapting the selection pres -
sures of our directed evolution workflows, we will be able to engi -
neer a suite of useful biocatalysts with complementary functions 
and improved activities under process-relevant conditions. For 
example, we can extend catalyst stability and lifetime by increas
-
ing reaction times and temperatures, optimize biocatalysts to act 
on alternative plastic substrates or enhance enzyme specificities in 
order that they operate on single polymer components from mixed 
plastic waste streams. In doing so, our laboratory evolution platform 
will contribute to a biocatalytic recycling strategy to recover value 
from plastic waste.
Methods
Gene construction. The genes encoding IsPETaseTS (IsPETase S121E, D186H, 
R280A, signal sequence removed as by Son et al.24) and LCCICCG (LCC F243I, 
D238C, S283C, Y127G, signal sequence removed as by Tournier et al.16) were 
commercially synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies as gBlock fragments 
with codon optimization for expression in Escherichia coli cells. The IsPETaseTS 
gene was cloned into the NdeI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) sites of a pBbE8K vector 
modified to contain a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag coding sequence following 
the XhoI restriction site
41, to form pBbE8K_IsPETaseTS. The gene encoding 
LCCICCG was cloned into the NdeI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) sites of pET-22b 
vector (Novagen) leading to fusion to a C-terminal hexa-histadine tag coding 
sequence, to form pET-22b_LCC
ICCG. Nucleotide sequences and expressed amino 
acid sequences of the genes used and plasmid maps of the vector constructs are 
provided in Supplementary Figs. 17–19.
Library construction. Rounds 1–6: iterative saturation mutagenesis. In each 
round, 24–30 residues were selected and individually randomized using cassette 
mutagenesis. Positions were chosen for mutation on the basis of a range of factors, 
detailed in Supplementary Table 1. For residue identification via the Protein One 
Stop Repair Shop webserver
42, IsPETaseWT was used as the input protein (PDB 
5XJH), with all constraints fixed to the default settings; positions identified more 
than twice by the software were selected for mutation. For residue identification 
via the B-fitter software
43, IsPETaseWT was again used as the input protein 
(PDB 5XJH); the 15 top positions ranked by highest B-factor were selected for 
mutation. DNA libraries at chosen residue positions were constructed via standard 
overlap-extension PCR, using degenerate primer pairs (containing an NNK codon 
at the position to be mutated) and pBbE8K_IsPETase
TS as the template for round 
1, with the most active clone discovered at the end of each directed evolution cycle 
serving as the template for subsequent rounds. Primer sequences are provided in 
Supplementary Table 2.
Shuffling by overlap-extension PCR. After each round of evolution, beneficial 
diversity was combined by a process of DNA shuffling. Fragments were generated 
by overlap-extension PCR using designed primers that encoded for either an 
identified beneficial mutation or the parental amino acid. Using these primers,

up to six short fragments were created, DpnI digested, PCR-purified and mixed 
in appropriate combinations in overlap-extension PCRs. The resulting genes 
contained all possible combinations of mutations (from two to five mutations 
per gene) and were subsequently cloned into the pBbE8K vector as described 
previously.
Variant gene construction. HotPETase K212N, E213S, Y214S (HotPETase
LR), was 
created via overlap-extension PCR with HotPETase as the template protein and 
primers designed to encode the wild-type residues at positions 212–214. Primer 
sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 3. The resulting gene was cloned 
into the pBbE8K vector as described previously.
Protein production for library screening. For all protein expression and screening 
of libraries, transfer and aliquoting steps were performed using a Hamilton 
liquid-handling robot. pBbE8K_IsPETase libraries were expressed in chemically 
competent Origami 2 E. coli cells. Single colonies from a fresh transformation were 
used to inoculate 180 µl of Luria–Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 25 µg ml
−1 
kanamycin (to maintain the pBbE8K_PETase plasmid) and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline 
(to maintain the glutathione reductase (gor) gene-containing plasmid present in 
Origami 2 cells), in 96-deep-well plates. Each plate contained six positive controls 
consisting of clones of the parent template, and two negative controls consisting of 
clones containing pBbE8K_RFP (red fluorescent protein). Plates were incubated 
overnight at 30 °C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Expression 
cultures were then prepared by inoculating 460 µl of 2YT media containing 
25 µg ml
−1 kanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline with 40 µl of overnight culture 
in deep-well plates. The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C, 80% humidity 
in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). When an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 
1 was reached, protein production was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose to 
a final concentration 10 mM and plates incubated for a further 20 h at 19 °C, 80% 
humidity in a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.). Cells were collected by centrifugation 
at 2,900g for 10 min and the resulting pellets resuspended in a lysis mix consisting 
of 50 µl of BugBuster Protein Extraction reagent containing 10 µg ml−1 DNase I. 
Cell lysis was initiated by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, with 80% humidity in 
a shaking incubator (950 r.p.m.) and the lysate produced diluted with 300 µl of 
reaction buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM glycine-OH (Gly-OH)). Insoluble cell debris was 
removed via centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g to produce a clear cell lysate.
Production of purified proteins. IsPETase and its derivatives were expressed in 
chemically competent Origami 2 E. coli. Single colonies of freshly transformed cells 
were cultured for 18 h at 30 °C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 µg ml
−1 
kanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 tetracycline. 1 ml of the resulting culture was used to 
inoculate 50 ml of 2YT medium containing 25 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 2.5 µg ml−1 
tetracycline. Cultures were grown at 35 °C, 180 r.p.m. to an OD600 of 1. Protein 
production was initiated by the addition of l-arabinose (final concentration of 
10 mM) and cultures then grown at 19 °C for 20 h. The E. coli cells were gathered 
by centrifugation at 3,220g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (pH 7.5, 
50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 10 µg ml
−1 DNase I). Cells were 
disrupted by sonication and the resulting lysate clarified by centrifugation (13,500g 
for 15 min). The soluble fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography via 
application to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). After washing off unbound proteins with 
the lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, bound proteins were eluted 
with elution buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl). 
Proteins were desalted by application to 10DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad) and 
eluted in storage buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). Protein purity 
was confirmed by SDS–PAGE and concentrations determined by measuring the 
absorbance at 280 nm, assuming an extinction coefficient of 39,670 M
−1 cm−1 
for IsPETaseTS-IsPETaseM2, 41,160 M−1 cm−1 for IsPETaseM3-IsPETaseM7 and 
41,285 M−1 cm−1 for IsPETaseM8-HotPETase.
For the cutinase, LCCICCG, the gene was expressed in chemically competent 
E. coli BL21 (DE3). Single colonies of freshly transformed cells were cultured 
for 18 h at 30 °C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 25 µg ml
−1 ampicillin. 
1 ml of the resulting culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of auto-inducible 2YT 
medium containing 25 µg ml−1 ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 35 °C, 180 r.p.m., 
to an OD600 of 1, and then cooled to 19 °C, for 20 h. Protein purification then 
proceeded as detailed for IsPETase, with protein concentrations determined using 
an extinction coefficient of 37,150 M−1 cm−1. HotPETase exhibits a high-level of 
cytosolic protein expression (roughly 110 mg l−1); LCCICCG has a lower level of 
protein expression (roughly 20 mg l−1) (Supplementary Fig. 20).
Library screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). The clarified cell lysate 
was incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55–80 °C (pre-incubation 
step) and subjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble 
protein precipitate formed. To initiate the PET degradation reaction, 60–220 µl 
of clarified cell lysate was transferred to a 96-deep-well plate containing reaction 
buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) and a single 6 mm amoPET disc cut from a sheet 
in each well, to make a final reaction volume of 220–400 μl. Lysate volume was 
varied across rounds to avoid overloading the UPLC column by keeping peak 
areas below 2,000 mAu and to limit evaporation at higher reaction temperatures 
and extended reaction times. Plates were then foil-sealed and incubated for 3–7 h 
at 55–70 °C, after which reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal 
volume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM trifluoracetic acid solution. Following 
reaction quenching, plates were foil-sealed and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, 
80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble protein precipitate 
removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC analysis sample was 
then prepared by transferring 100 µl of the resulting reaction supernatant into a 
fresh 96-well microtitre plate and the plate foil-sealed. The most active clones of 
each round were then subjected to a second screening round, where each clone 
was represented as a triplicate. All expression and screening protocols were as 
described above, apart from overnight culture preparation, where LB media was 
instead inoculated with 20 µl of a glycerol stock of the original overnight cultures 
from the library screening round. Details for the temperatures and lengths of the 
pre-incubation steps, the lysate volumes added to reactions, and the temperatures 
and lengths of the reaction incubations for each round of directed evolution are 
provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Purified protein screening using amorphous PET film (amoPET). AmoPET film 
assays with purified proteins were conducted as follows: a foil-sealed 96-deep-well 
plate containing the reaction buffer (library screening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM 
Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its derivatives, pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi, for 
LCC
ICCG, as reported in Tournier et al.16), with a single 6 mm amoPET disc in each 
well, was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40–70 °C) to equilibrate 
all reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration step). For 
directed evolution hit retesting and beneficial diversity shuffling, purified 
proteins were incubated in foil-sealed plates for 30 min to 1 h at 55–80 °C before 
reaction set up (pre-incubation step, full details in Supplementary Table 1) and 
subjected to centrifugation at 2,900g for 10 min to remove any insoluble protein 
precipitate formed. The reaction was initiated by adding the purified enzymes 
to the prepared 96-deep-well plate containing reaction buffer and amoPET discs 
(final reaction conditions: 0.04 μM enzyme, 400 μl total volume). Protein variants 
were arrayed across the 96-deep-well plate in triplicate. Plates were foil-sealed and 
incubated for up to 24 h at the desired temperature, after which reactions were 
terminated by the addition of an equal volume of a cold methanol and 12.5 mM 
trifluoracetic acid solution. Following reaction quenching, samples were incubated 
for 30 min at 30 °C, 80% humidity in a shaking incubator, 950 r.p.m. and insoluble 
protein precipitate removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,900g. A UPLC 
analysis sample was then prepared by transferring 100 µl of the resulting reaction 
supernatant into a fresh 96-well microtitre plate, and the plate foil-sealed.
Purified protein screening using crystalline PET powder (cryPET) and 
alternative PET substrates. Crystalline PET powder assays were conducted 
as follows: a 12 ml lidded glass vial containing 5 ml of reaction buffer (library 
screening buffer, pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, for IsPETase and its 
derivatives or pH 8, 100 mM K-Pi for LCC
ICCG), with 20 mg crystalline PET 
powder (cryPET) was incubated for 1 h at the reaction temperature (40–70 °C) 
to equilibrate all reaction components to the reaction temperature (equilibration 
step). The reaction was initiated by adding the purified protein (0.04 μM final 
concentration) coupled with incubation at the desired temperature under agitation 
at 180 r.p.m. Samples were taken at multiple times points, quenched and prepared 
for UPLC analysis as detailed previously. The percentage depolymerization of 
plastic was calculated using the mass of TPA and MHET produced, using the 
concentrations of each compound as determined by UPLC. For assays under 
optimized conditions, reactions were carried out as above, using a final enzyme 
concentration of 0.5 μM in pH 9.7, 50 mM Gly-OH buffer, 4% BugBuster.
For bottle-grade PET assays, bottle-grade PET pellets (bgPET, RamaPET N1) 
were micronized using a RETSCH PM100 Planetary Ball Mill at 500 r.p.m. for 
30 min to form a powder. For PET/PE composite packaging tray lid assays, PET/
PE composite packaging lids, thickness of 325 μM PET and 40 μM PE, were cut into 
6-mm discs. For both materials, 20 mg of the resulting prepared substrates were 
used in reactions, with reaction conditions as described above. Full characterizations 
of the PET substrates described are detailed in Extended Data Table 1.
Chromatographic analysis of reactions. UPLC analysis was carried out on a 
1290 Infinity II Agilent LC system including an autosampler with the ultraviolet 
detector set to 260 nm, using a Kinetex XB-C18 100 Å, 5 µm, 50 × 2.1 mm, LC 
Column with a stepped, isocratic solvent ratio method. Mobile phase A was water 
containing 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with a fixed flow 
rate of 1.1 ml min
−1. Either 1 or 4 μl of sample was injected for library screening 
reactions or time-resolved purified protein assays, respectively. Following 
sample injection, the mobile phase was set to 13% buffer B for 52 s to separate 
TPA and MHET, stepped up to 95% buffer B for 33 s to separate larger reaction 
products and contaminants, and then stepped back down to 13% buffer B for 
column re-equilibration until a total run time of 1.8 min. Peaks were assigned by 
comparison to chemical standards prepared from commercial TPA and in-house 
synthesized MHET, and the peak areas integrated using Agilent OpenLab software. 
Using this method, TPA is eluted at roughly 0.4 min, MHET at around 0.6 min and 
small amounts of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and longer oligomers 
at around 1–1.2 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). TPA and MHET concentrations were 
calculated by preparation of standard curves (Supplementary Fig. 21).

Characterization of PET substrates pre- and post-degradation. Polymer 
crystallinity was determined using DSC, using 4 mg of material. DSC data were 
obtained from using a DSC 2500 TA instrument. Samples were run in triplicate, 
in series, over a −50 to 300 °C temperature range under a nitrogen atmosphere 
at a heating rate of ±10 °C min
−1 in a 40 μl aluminium crucible. The number and 
weight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of polymer chains were determined 
by SEC. Samples (4 mg) were dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol (120 μl) at 
room temperature. Once dissolved, HPLC-grade chloroform (1,880 μl) was 
added to form a uniform, colourless solution that was filtered through a 0.24 μm 
polytetrafluoroethylene filter. SEC analysis was conducted on a system composed 
of an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with an Agilent guard column 
(PLGel 5 μm, 50 × 7.5 mm) and two Agilent Mixed-C columns (PLGel 5 μm, 
300 × 7.5 mm). The mobile phase used was HPLC-grade CHCl
3 at 35 °C at flow rate 
of 1.0 ml min−1. SEC samples were calibrated against linear polystyrene standards 
(162–2.4 × 105 g mol−1).
SEM analysis of enzymatic depolymerizations of PET/PE composite packaging. 
A section of a PET/PE packaging lid (710 mg) was fully submerged in reaction 
buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH, 4% BugBuster, 50 ml total) in a glass bottle, and 
HotPETase (0.04 μM final concentration) added to initiate the reaction. Reactions 
were incubated at either 40 or 60 °C with agitation at 120 r.p.m. The PET/PE 
packaging lid portion was washed and a fresh buffer and enzyme solution added 
each day over the course of 6 days. The control reactions were run in an identical 
manner, but with no enzyme added. The percentage depolymerization of the 
PET portion of each lid section was estimated from the release of MHET and 
TPA monomers, determined by UPLC analysis of the reaction supernatant taken 
each day, assuming an estimated 12.6 g l
−1 PET substrate loading. The extent of 
depolymerization was further confirmed by weight loss analysis of samples before 
and after biotransformations. Samples were analysed by SEM as follows: polymer 
samples were sputter coated with Au/Pd (thickness 5 nm) to prevent charging 
during SEM imaging and were observed using secondary electron imaging in a 
Tescan SC Mira, FEG-SEM with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and probe current 
of approximately 2 nA.
Protein melting temperature (T
m) analysis. The melting temperatures (Tm)  
of IsPETase and its variants were determined using differential scanning 
fluorimetry. For each protein, a 50 μl sample of 5 μM protein was prepared in  
buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM Gly-OH) with a final concentration of 10X SYPRO  
Orange dye stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in an optically clear, lidded PCR 
tube (Bio-rad). Differential scanning fluorimetry melt-curve experiments were 
conducted using a Bio-rad CFX Connect 96 Real-Time PCR system set on  
the fluorescence resonance energy transfer channel to use the 450/490 excitation 
and 560/580 emission filters. The temperature was increased from 25 to  
95 °C with an increment of 0.3 °C s
−1. Each protein’s Tm was determined from a 
mean value for the peak of the first derivative of the melt curve from three  
replicate measurements.
Structure determination of HotPETase. Protein crystallization of HotPETase 
was achieved by sitting drop vapour diffusion of 20 nl of 6 mg ml
−1 protein mixed 
with an equal volume of reservoir solution and incubated at 20 °C. Crystals 
were observed after 72 h incubation with a reservoir solution comprising 0.85 M 
sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0 and 0.1 M sodium chloride 
(LMB screen HT96 H7 Molecular Dimensions). Before data collection, crystals 
were cryogentically protected with the addition of 20% PEG 200 to the mother 
liquor and plunge cooled in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at Diamond 
Light Source. Data reduction was performed with Dials and the structure 
solved by molecular replacement using a search model derived from Is PETase
WT 
structure PDB 5XJH. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement were 
performed in COOT and Phenix using phenix.refine and phenix.ensemble_
refinement. Validation with MOLPROBITY and PDBREDO were incorporated 
into the iterative rebuild and refinement process. Data collection and refinement 
statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 4. The HotPETase coordinates 
and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under accession number 
7QVH. The 4PET docking simulations were performed in ICM-Pro and resulted 
in a number of potential docked conformations. BHET was first docked into the 
active site using distance restraints to Ser160 and the backbone amides of the 
oxyanion hole to guide the docking towards catalytically plausible conformations. 
The position of the docked BHET was subsequently used as a template restraint 
for the larger 4PET docking. The top ranking docked pose of 4PET had an ICM 
VLS score of −31.
