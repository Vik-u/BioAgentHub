ABSTRACT 37 
Low recycling rates have resulted in the alarming rate of accum ulation of a widely used 38 
plastic material, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). With the bu ild-up of plastics in our 39 
environment, there is an urgent need to source for more sustainable solutions to process them. 40 
Biological methods such as enzyme- catalyzed PET recycling or bi oprocessing are seen as a 41 
potential solution to this problem. Actinobacteria, known for p roducing enzymes involved in 42 
the degradation of complex organic molecules, are of particular  interest due to their potential 43 
to produce PET degrading enzymes. The highly thermostable enzym e, leaf-branch compost 44 
cutinase (LCC) found in  Actinobacteria is one such example. This work expands on the 45 
discovery and characterization of new PET degrading enzymes fro m Microbispora, 46 
Nonomuraea, and Micromonospora genus. Within this genus, we analyzed enzymes from the 47 
polyesterase-lipase-cutinase family, which have ~60% similarity  to LCC , whe re  one  of the 48 
enzymes was found to be capable of breaking down PET and BHET at 45-50 °C. Moreover, 49 
we were able to enhance the enzyme's depolymerization rate thro ugh further engineering, 50 
resulting in a two-fold increase in activity. 51 
 52 
IMPORTANCE The proliferation of PET plastic waste poses a significant thre at to human 53 
and environmental health, making it an issue of increasing concern. In response to this 54 
challenge, scientists are investigating eco-friendly approaches , such as bioprocessing and 55 
microbial factories, to sustainably manage the growing quantity  of plastic waste in our 56 
ecosystem. Despite the existence of enzymes capable of degradin g  P E T ,  t h e i r  s c a r c i t y  i n  57 
nature limits their applicability. The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of 58 
this group of enzymes by identifying and characterizing novel o nes that can facilitate the 59 
breakdown of PET waste. This data will expand the enzymatic repertoire and provide 60 
valuable insights into the prerequisites for successful PET degradation.  61

INTRODUCTION 62 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is amongst the most widely man ufactured and utilized 63 
plastic material for consumer a nd industrial applications due t o its favorable physiochemical 64 
properties and durability (1). With an estimated production of at least 1 million PET bottles 65 
every minute (2) and a global recycling rate of 9% (3) , the rapid and large accumulation of 66 
non-biodegradable post-consumer PET waste either end up in land fills, terrestrial or aquatic 67 
environment. These PET that end up in the terrestrial or aquati c environment not only have a 68 
slow rate of decomposition, but can also subsequently enter the  marine ecosystem as 69 
microplastics - posing risks to the environment and the health of both animals and humans (4, 70 
5). Consequently, addressing the PET waste crisis is imperative  for both environmental and 71 
health sustainability. Traditional solid waste treatment method s, such as landfill and 72 
incineration, have limitations in terms of secondary pollution and limited land resources. The 73 
main thermomechanical and chemical recycling methods are energy -intensive, requiring high 74 
temperatures, and can result in alterations to the properties o f the PET plastic (6). Thus, there 75 
is a growing interest in less energy-intensive or "natural" met hods for processing this 76 
material.  77 
 78 
The discovery of the first PET degrading enzyme PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 79 
(IsPETase) (7, 8) in 2016, gave hopes to a biological solution through enzymes and microbial 80 
factories for processing this inert plastic. Enzyme-catalyzed P ET recycling or bioprocessing 81 
can proceed under mild reaction conditions, with minimal energy  and chemical usage. This 82 
method of recycling is thus a more environmentally responsible alternative to petroleum-83 
derived production processes. To  i m p r o v e  P E T a s e  t o w a r d s  p r a c t i cal application, there has 84 
been numerous studies reporting more thermostable and active ve rsions of the enzyme (9). 85 
Since then, various PET degradation enzymes have also been identified, including CALB 86

lipase from Candida antarctica (10), cutinases from Fusarium solani, Humicola insolens, and 87 
Thermobifida fusca (11). According to the Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy),  there 88 
are ~3000 homologs of PET-active enzymes by profile hidden Markov models (12).  89 
 90 
Actinobacteria is a diverse group of bacteria known to produce a wide range of enzymes that 91 
are utilized in various industria l and medical applications, such as antibiotic production and 92 
degradation of environmental contaminants (13, 14). In particul ar, the actinobacteria are of 93 
interest due to their ability to produce cutinases and hydrolas es, enzymes involved in the 94 
degradation of complex organic molecules and synthesis of essential nutrients (14). One of 95 
the most outstanding and highly thermostable PET degrading enzy mes found in the 96 
actinobacteria is the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC), which  was mined from 97 
metagenomes (15). A recent report by Erickson et.al on another PET degrading enzyme 98 
within the actinobacteria famil y, further underscores the poten tial of actinobacteria as a 99 
source for PET depolymerization. Given the capabilities of acti nobacteria in PET 100 
depolymerization, this study aim to explore other actinobacteri a for new PET degrading 101 
enzymes (16). 102 
 103 
In this work, we expand the enzymes for PET breakdown from acti nobacteria through the 104 
discovery, engineering, and characterization of new and unexplo red PET degrading enzymes 105 
from Microbispora, Nonomuraea, Micromonospora genus.   106

RESULTS 107 
Genomic mining and in silico analysis of distant cutinase homologs 108 
With reference to the reported LCC, potential hydrolases were o btained from the genera 109 
Microbispora, Nonomuraea, and Micromonospora through mining actinobacterial genomic 110 
sequences in public databases such as Genbank and Natural Products Discovery Center 111 
(NPDC) (17), as well as the Singapore-based Natural Organism Li brary (NOL) (18). Within 112 
these hits, we selected four representative sequences from NOL. Sequence alignment analysis 113 
between the four cutinases indicate sequence similarity (~60-61  % homology to LCC, Fig. 114 
1B), including the presence of the three active site triad resi dues for PET breakdown (Asp, 115 
Ser and His, Fig. 1A). Cysteine residues for disulfide bridge f ormation were also observed 116 
(Fig. S1). Search within the ESTHER database (19) also shows  h igh similarity hits of these 117 
enzymes as part of the polyesterase-lipase-cutinase family; sim ilar to many previously 118 
reported PET hydrolases. (Fig. S2). Absence of an extended loop and extra disulfide bond 119 
near the active site also classify these enzymes to be Type I ( LCC) rather than Type II 120 
(IsPETase) (20). Structural alignment based on in silico AlphaFold models also proposed that 121 
their general structure is close ly aligned to that of the LCC, including positions of the active 122 
site residues (Table S1, Fig. S1). Although the core active sit es and general structures are 123 
conserved, electrostatic predic tion of the surface indicated se quence divergence are mainly 124 
surface residues. This observation is consistent to conclusions  drawn from an extensive study 125 
on PET breakdown enzymes (16).  126

Optimizing heterologous expression 135 
To investigate if the shortlisted sequences encode functional e nzymes, there is a need to 136 
identify a suitable expression system. For heterologous expression of these enzymes in 137 
Escherichia Coli ( E. coli ), optimization was first perform e d  f o r  t h e  p r o t e i n  e x p r e s s i o n  138 
constructs of SIBER 1-4. These were screened with various combinations of solubility tags 139 
for optimal expression (Fig. 2). Solubility aids which involved  the Small Ubiquitin-like 140 
Modifier (SUMO (22)) and a 11 amino acid tag, NT11 (23), and Ma ltose Binding Protein 141 
(MBP) were investigated. Our optimization data showed varied ex pression levels across 142 
enzymes and tag combinations (Fig. 2). Overall, SIBER 1 constru cts had significantly higher 143

further scaled up and the resulting proteins were purified for characterization (SIBER 1- 145

BHET and PET breakdown assays, characterization of SIBER 171, 196, 207, 228 156 
To assess the functional activity of the enzymes, the purified enzymes (SIBER 171, SIBER 157 
196, SIBER 207, SIBER 228) were subjected to various assays of different substrates (e.g., 158 
BHET, hcPET, lcPET). Under ambient temperature (25 °C) at pH 7,  a ll t he  e nz ym e s we re 159 
able to hydrolyze BHET to various extents (Fig 3).  The best mu tant is SIBER 171 which 160 
resulted in ~95% depolymerization by the end of 24 h. SIBER 171 was also functional up to 161 
50 °C, whereas SIBER 196, SIBER 207 and SIBER 228 were only fun ctional at 25 °C. 162

Applying the reported optimized LCC conditions (70 °C, 48 h) for PET depolymerization to 172 
these enzymes did not show any PET breakdown, suggesting that t he native enzymes are not 173 
tolerable to such high temperatures. Re-assaying these enzymes at lower temperatures (25 °C 174 
or 45 °C) over longer time (up to 3 weeks), we found that all f ive enzymes were able to 175 
assimilate high crystallinity PET (hcPET), though at a very slo w rate (Fig. 4, S6). The best 176 
performing enzyme herein is again SIBER 171. Conversions mostly  doubled in the second 177

week when compared to the first week, indicating that the enzym e was still active. None of 178 
the variants are sufficiently thermostable to effectively break  down high crystallinity (>35%) 179 
PET at 45 °C, though small amount  of PET conversion was observe d at 45 °C after 1 week 180 
for the enzymes SIBER 171, there was no further conversion afte r one week, suggesting that 181 
SIBER 171 might have been inactivated (Fig. 4, S6).  182

Engineering of SIBER 171 190 
To determine if similar optimizations made to LCC can be applie d to improve SIBER 171, 191 
additional mutations were introduced, including the insertion o f a disulfide bond for 192 
increased thermal stability (D238C/S283C, as numbered in (9)), F243I mutation to restore 193 
activity and N246M mutation for further optimization. Here, we made similar mutations for 194 
SIBER 171, resulting in SIBER 821 (SIBER 1-ICC) and SIBER 822 ( SIBER 1-ICCM). As a 195 
result of these mutations, we were also able to obtain signific antly higher yielding enzymes 196

(30-40 mg/L, Fig. S5). Subsequently these purified enzymes were  characterized for BHET 197 
breakdown at 50°C and PET breakdown at both 45 °C and 65 °C. 198 
 199 
During BHET hydrolysis (50 °C, pH  7), we observed detrimental e ffects of ICC mutations 200 
which are however restored with N246M mutation (Fig. 5a). Under these conditions, there 201 
are minimal differences between native and engineered enzymes. However, using low 202 
crystallinity PET (lcPET) substrates at 45 °C, there appears to  be significant improvement of 203 
SIBER 822 over the native enzymes over one week (Fig. 5). At 65  ° C ,  n o  P E T  204 
depolymerization was observed for both enzymes. Our observation s suggest that, despite not 205 
being enough to increase its working temperature, the addition of a di-sulfide bridge to 206 
SIBER 1 resulted in potentially better stability at 45°C over 1  week when compared to its 207 
native enzyme. Although this is lower than optimized LCC (9) wh ich yield PET 208 
depolymerization of 40% after 48 hours (Fig. S7), it is still e ncouraging to note that SIBER 209 
822 is significantly more active than IsPETase double mutant (24) (~0.08%-0.09% at 48 210 
hours, Table S4).  We anticipate that the further improvement o f the enzyme towards 211 
practical applications will necessitate the implementation of a dditional engineering 212 
techniques, such as directed evolution and computational design. 213

DISCUSSION 219 
This study aims to deepen the understanding of PET-degrading en zymes by identifying and 220 
describing new ones that can aid in PET waste biodegradation. A lthough some PET-221 
degrading enzymes are known, their rarity restricts the utilization of it. Even with the addition 222 
of 34 more recently characterized PET degrading enzymes from th e actinobacteria family 223 
(16), this still adds up to only a few dozen of verified PET-active enzymes (12). Exploring a 224 
new genus space, we found hydrolases that have varying specific ities towards substrates 225 
BHET, MHET, and even PET. Within representative four sequences, we have uncovered and 226 
characterized a new thermostable PETase within the genus of Microbispora, Nonomuraea, 227 
and Micromonospora genus. Furthermore, despite sharing only 60% homology with LCC, we 228 
discovered that incorporating similar mutations previously used in the engineering of LCC 229 
(9) could improve SIBER 171's activity and stability. The engin eered enzyme (SIBER 822) 230 
exhibited over two-fold improvement for lcPET depolymerization compared to its wild type. 231 
 232 
To date, there are over 2000 known PET homologs and several enz yme engineering studies 233 
have proposed targeted mutations to improve thermostability, ac tivity, and accessibility to 234 
PET. The results of this work raise questions about the factors  that determine a PETase and 235 
the relationship between thermostability and PET degradation ef ficiency, especially in light 236 
of the impact of the substrate's physical properties (25), such  as crystallinity. Among the four 237 
enzymes, there were notable differences and correlations in sol ubility and expression yields 238 
and activity. Here, among the SIBER 1-4 genes, SIBER 1 construc ts had consistent higher 239 
protein expression yields. After engineering of SIBER 171, we also observed significant 240 
expression yield increase in engineered SIBER 822. This is cons istent with the discussions of 241 
correlations between protein folding and protein activity, wher e the thermodynamics of the 242 
sequences may play a role in pr oper and accurate folding (26). Beyond stability, further 243

investigation on the mechanism of PET degradation is required t o gain a deeper 244 
understanding on the potential to design and develop new and hi ghly efficient PETases. The 245

Biosciences. These inserts were assembled via golden gate into pET28a (+), cloned with E. 258 
coli Omnimax competent cells. E. coli XJb (DE3) autolysis competent cells (Zymo Research) 259 
was subsequently used for the transformation of these 6xHis tag  constructs for protein 260 
expression. Table S2 shows the amino acid sequences of the gene  used and the solubility tags 261 
used are shown in Table S3. 262 
 263 
High throughput screening of heterologous expression constructs 264 
1 mL overnight autoinduction media (Merck) was used for the ino culation of single colonies 265 
obtained from the transformation, in which 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 1.5 M L-arabinose and 0.5 266 
M magnesium chloride was also added. A single freeze thaw cycle  in lysis buffer (50 mM 267 
sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM Imidazol e and 0.03 % TritonX-268 
100), from the cell pellet harvested allowed the cell to releas e its embedded protein. To 269 
capture these His-tagged proteins, Ni resin (PureCube, Cube Bio tech) was used. These 270 
proteins were subsequently eluted in 50 mM sodium phosphate buf fer pH 7.0, 300 mM 271 
sodium chloride and 500 mM imidazole. Quantification of the protein elutes on a protein gel 272

was performed by ImageJ to compare protein yields across the different constructs. Intensity 273 
of each band obtained was normalized to the intensity of the re ference band on the standard 274 
ladder used, as well as molecular weight of each protein. This densitometric comparison was 275 
used to determine the best yielding constructs which were then scaled up for purification and 276 
subsequent characterization.  277 
 278 
Protein expression and purification 279 
A starter culture of 5 mL grown in LB Broth containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin was prepared, 280 
where a single colony from the transformation was inoculated ov ernight at 37 °C. The starter 281 
culture was diluted 200-fold in a fresh 1 L LB Broth containing  50 μg/mL kanamycin, 1.5 M 282 
L-arabinose and 0.5 M Magnesium chloride. Subcultures were grow n at 37 °C until the 283 
optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached ~0.4 – 0.5. 100 μM is opropyl β-D-1-284 
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to induce the expression of proteins. Following 285 
which, the cultures were incubated overnight at 16 °C for 18 to 20 hours. Cells were 286 
harvested from this culture using a centrifuge (15 minutes, 8000 g) maintained at 4 °C, before 287 
resuspending and freezing the resulting pellet at -80 °C in 10 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 288 
mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 300 mM sodium chloride, 10 m M Imidazole and 0.03 289 
% TritonX-100. To ensure protein stability, subsequent purifica tion steps were also carried 290 
out at 4 °C.  291 
 292 
The frozen pellet was thawed with the addition of 10mL lysis bu ffer and sonicated to release 293 
proteins from the cells. The supernatant obtained from centrifu gation of lysates at 13,500xg 294 
was loaded on Ni resin and incubated for 1 hour to capture the His-tagged proteins. 20mL of 295 
50mM sodium phosphate buffer, 300mM sodium chloride and 50mM im idazole was then 296 
used to wash the resin, before eluting the bound proteins with 50mM sodium phosphate 297

exchanged into 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 with 10% glycerol to allow for long-term 299 
storage at -80 °C. Subsequent BHET and PET degradation studies were carried out with these 300 
purified proteins. 301 
 302 
BHET depolymerization assay 303 
Dimethylformamide was used to dissolve 1 M BHET stock solution.  BHET stock solution 304 
(2.5 µL, 5 mM) was pipetted into a 2 mL glass vial containing 5 00 µL of 100 mM potassium 305 
phosphate buffer (pH 7) and 1.67 µM purified protein. The glass  vial was tightly capped, and 306 
the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 24 hours in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer®. 307 
After 24 hours, the reaction is quenched with 500 µL of methano l. The mixture was 308 
transferred into a 10 mL centrif uge tube, the vial was washed w ith 4 mL of buffer/methanol 309 
(1:1, v/v) and the contents were transferred to the centrifuge tube. This is followed by the 310 
addition of 5 mL 0.5 mM 4-bromobenzoic acid in buffer/methanol (1:1, v/v) as an internal 311 
standard. The reaction mixture was sonicated, and an aliquot wa s filtered with a 0.2 µm 312 
syringe filter and analyzed via UHPLC-MS. 313 
 314 
Calibration of BHET and TPA 315 
BHET and TPA stock solutions (1 mM) were prepared by dissolving  the solids in 5 mL of in 316 
buffer/methanol (1:1, v/v), followed by the addition of 5 mL 0. 5 mM 4-bromobenzoic acid in 317 
buffer/methanol (1:1, v/v) as an internal standard. 6 concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 318 
1 mM were prepared from the stock solution and analyzed via UPH LC-MS. A calibration 319 
was plotted with the molar ratio against area ratio. LC spectru m of TPA (Fig. S8) revealed 2 320 
peaks (RT 8 min and RT 8.4 min) and the LC-MS spectrum extracte d from both peaks 321

correspond to TPA [M-H] - ion m/z 165 (Fig. S8). The area of both peaks was taking into 322 
consideration in the plotting of calibration curve of TPA (Fig. S8).  323 
 324 
Calibration of MHET 325 
MHET (1 M) was prepared by dissolving the solids in dimethylfor mamide. 6 concentrations 326 
ranging from 0.03 mM to 0.18 mM were prepared from the MHET sto ck solution, topped up 327 
with 0.5 mM 4-bromobenzoic acid internal standard and analyzed via UPHLC-MS. A 328 
calibration was plotted with the molar ratio against area ratio.   329 
 330 
PET depolymerization assay 331 
PET powder (2 mg, 20 mM) was weighed into a 2 mL glass vial and  fully submerged in 500 332 
µL of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) with 1.67 µM purified protein. The glass 333 
vial was tightly capped, and the reaction mixture was incubated  at 500 rpm and 25-50°C for 334 
48 hours to up to 28 days in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer®. The reaction is quenched with 500 335 
µL of methanol. The mixture was transferred into a 10 mL centri fuge tube, the vial was 336 
washed with 4 mL of buffer/methanol (1:1, v/v) and the contents  were transferred to the 337 
centrifuge tube. This is followed by the addition of 5 mL 0.5 m M 4-bromobenzoic acid in 338 
buffer/methanol (1:1, v/v) as an internal standard. The reaction mixture was sonicated, and an 339 
aliquot was filtered with a 0.2 µm syringe filter and analyzed via UHPLC-MS. 340
