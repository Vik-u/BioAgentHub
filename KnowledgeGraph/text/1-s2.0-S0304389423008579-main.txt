ABSTRACT  
Plastic pollution remains a significant environmental challenge, with conventional waste management strategies 
proving insufficient in addressing the problem. Enzymatic degradation has emerged as a promising alternative, 
with LCC
ICCG
, an engineered metagenome-derived cutinase, being the most effective in degrading polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), the most commonly produced and discarded polyester. However, more efficient PET- 
hydrolases are needed for the upscaling of a PET-waste biorefinery. In this regard, the study reports the char -
acterization of a novel, phylogenetically distinct, thermophilic polyesterase from Deinococcus maricopensis 
( Dm PETase) and its comparison to LCC
ICCG
. Dm PETase is capable of degrading various synthetic polymers, 
including PET, polyurethane, as well as four semi-crystalline aliphatic polyesters. Dm PETase was found to be 
comparable to LCC

appeared to be less sensitive to crystallinity degree increase. This property makes Dm PETase a new template for 
protein engineering endeavors to create an efficient biocatalyst to be integrated into the bio-recycling process of 
PET waste, without the need for amorphization of the materials.

1. Introduction 
Synthetic plastics are polymer materials that have become an 
indispensable part of contemporary life due to the multitude of appli -
cations they provide and the improved quality of life they offer. This has 
resulted in a sharp increase in global demand of plastics in the past 
decade, with approximately 400 million tons produced in 2021, pre -
dominantly destined for packaging and construction purposes [1] . Since 
the advent of widespread plastic production in 1950, roughly 60% of 
used plastic has been discarded to the environment, being accumulated 
because of their high durability and resistance, creating a persistent 
problem [2 – 5] . As a result, plastic waste has become ubiquitous and can 
be found virtually everywhere, from the heights of mount Everest [6] to 
the depths of the Mariana Trench [7] . 
Recent studies have indicated that, globally, plastic waste primarily 
consists of polyesters, following the polyolefins [5] . PET was the most 
produced polyester resin in 2021 [1] with applications mainly in the 
manufacture of fibers for the clothing industry, and food and beverage 
containers, accounting for nearly 45% of single-serve bottle production 
[8 – 10] . The majority of PET waste ends up in landfills, ultimately 
making its way into terrestrial and marine environments in the form of 
fragments and oligomers [11] , causing harm to living organisms [12,13] 
and eventually entering the human food chain [14] . 
Conventional plastic waste management methods (landfills and 
incineration) seek to mitigate the growing volume of plastic waste, but 
they are limited by economic and environmental constraints. Eco- 
friendly options, such as recycling, present noticeable boundaries. For 
instance, despite the high collection rates of PET (up to 50%), the quality 
of recycled PET final products tends to be lower than the virgin materials 
[15,16] . Biodegradable polymers have also been proposed as a green 
alternative, since they can degrade under environmental conditions. 
Their degradation is facilitated by the enzymatic machinery of various 
microorganisms breaking them down in oligo- and monomers [9,17] . 
Nonetheless, biodegradables have not been proven to be a panacea, as 
their natural degradation can take several decades, depending on 
environmental conditions [18 – 20] . To address this limitation, a more 
direct and controlled approach of degradation through enzymatic pro -
cesses might accrue, leading to a bio-dependent, eco-friendly and 
feasible strategy for managing plastic waste. 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in discovering 
novel plastic-degrading enzymes, with a focus on polyesters, particu -
larly PET, a major contributor to plastic pollution. The persistent nature 
of PET is attributed to the presence of aromatic components in its 
backbone, which hinder access by microorganisms and prevent 
biodegradation [21] . Most PET-degrading enzymes are bacterial and 
fungal carboxylesterases, belonging mostly to the cutinase family, which 
in nature conduce to the degradation of cutin, a natural waxy polyester 
[22] . Even though numerous enzymes have been discovered or engi -
neered so far to efficiently degrade amorphous PET, degradation of the 
polymer ’ s crystalline regions remains a challenge [23] . 
One of the central figures in amorphous PET biodegradation is the 
metagenome-derived LC-Cutinase (LCC), which has been extensively 
investigated for this ability. Recent advancements have led to the 
development of a thermostable variant of LCC (LCC
ICCG
) that exhibits 
high specificity towards PET and demonstrates remarkable efficiency in 
depolymerizing amorphized PET waste [24,25] . Concerning high crys -
tallinity PET, it seems that LCC
ICCG 
presents room for improvement 
while a latest study proved that further protein engineering might be the 
solution [26] . Notably, LCC
ICCG 
is the only enzyme to be industrialized 
for PET biorecycling, with a processing temperature of 72 
◦
C, and is 
expected to be implemented on a large scale in the near future [23,27] . 
Polymer biodegradation has been suggested to be more effective near 
the glass transition temperature ( T
g
), since chains are more accessible to 
enzymes, due to the abrupt conversion of the plastic state from glassy to 
rubbery [28,29] . For this reason, thermostability of PET hydrolases has 
been considered as an important feature, since T
g 
of PET is around 70 
◦
C. 
However, the temporal aspect of PET degradation at those temperatures 
is very crucial, as studies demonstrated a correlation between polymer ’ s 
crystallinity degree increase and reaction duration. Notably, PET storage 
at temperatures around its T
g 
for 48 h, initiates not only its “ physical 
aging ” , but also the rearrangement of shorter polymer segments, leading 
to an increase in crystallinity, hindering the enzymatic depolymeriza -
tion further [30,31] . Consequently, enzymatic degradation of amor -
phous PET at temperatures near its T
g
, only makes sense for short 
reaction times, necessitating the utilization of enzymes with very high 
catalytic turnover, such as LCC
ICCG
. For lower reaction temperatures, 
polymer aging and crystallization are not an issue, hence slower en -
zymes can also be utilized. 
In fact, amorphous PET degradation has been shown at milder 
temperatures of 30 – 50 
◦
C by the benchmark mesophilic PETase from the 
bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 ( Is PETase) [32] and its thermo -
stable variants. The most recently-designed variant, FAST-PETase (a 
quintuple mutation of Is PETase), outperformed the thermotolerant 
LCC
ICCM
, by presenting 5-fold higher degradation of amorphous post -
consumer PET products at 50 
◦
C [33] . This fact is indicating that protein 
engineering of non-thermophilic PET hydrolases could work as a greener 
route of PET degradation at lower temperatures. 
In the present study, we report the discovery and biochemical 
characterization of a novel cutinase-like enzyme, designated as Dm PE -
Tase, from the bacterium Deinococcus maricopensis . Dm PETase ’ s 
demonstrated polyesterase activity is compared to the benchmark PET- 
degrader LCC
ICCG 
on a broad range of synthetic materials, including 
commercial plastics, such as PET and polyether polyurethane, as well as 
the biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS), polycaprolactone 
(PCL), polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA). Empha -
sizing on PET, our research focused on the effect of crystallinity on PET 
degradation, as PETases discovered to date have been shown to effi -
ciently hydrolyze amorphous or low crystallinity PET, but their effec -
tiveness is significantly limited at increased crystallinity [31] . To this 
aim, enzymatic reactions were conducted with virgin, amorphous and 
semi-crystalline powder, as well as with two types (transparent, colored) 
of post-consumer water bottles in their original and powdered form. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Sequence and structural analysis of DmPETase 
The identification of the signal peptide for the full-length sequence of 
the E8U721 (UniProtKB) protein was performed using SignalP-6.0 [34] . 
A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 11.0 using the 
Neighbor-Joining method, which incorporated 25 sequences from the 
PDB database that were homologous to E8U721. The AlphaFold2 
(AF2)-generated 3D structure of the enzyme was downloaded from the 
AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (UniProt ID: E8U721) and visu -
alized by UCSF Chimera v1.15, excluding the native signal peptide 
(residues 1 – 33) and the residues 34 – 55, due to the absence of secondary 
structure information and their misalignment with structures of other 
polyesterase structures. The electrostatic (Coulomb) potential surface 
was constructed and visualized by UCSF Chimera using the default 
parameters. 
2.2. Cloning, heterologous expression and purification of DmPETase and 
LCC
ICCG 
Genes encoding the cutinase-like enzyme from D. maricopensis 
( Dm PETase, UniProtKB ID: E8U721 excluding the native signal peptide) 
and quadruple variant of leaf branch compost cutinase (LCC
ICCG
, variant 
F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G, wild-type LCC UniprotKB ID: G9BY57 
excluding the native signal peptide) were codon optimized for expres -
sion in Escherichia coli and synthesized in expression vectors pET22b( + ) 
and pET26b( + ), respectively, by GenScript Biotech B.V. (Netherlands). 
Chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with 
K. Makryniotis et al.

each vector and grown for 16 h in Luria-Bertani (LB) plates supple -
mented with the proper selection antibiotic, ampicillin and kanamycin 
for Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG
, respectively. The transformants were 
cultured in nutrient medium (LB or Terrific Broth) at 37 
◦
C under 
agitation (180 rpm) and recombinant enzyme expression was induced 
by the addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl β -D-1-thiogalactopyranosidase 
(IPTG) for 16 h at 16 
◦
C. 
For purification of recombinant enzymes, E. coli cells were harvested 
by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 15 min at 4 
◦
C, resuspended in 50 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl buffer and disrupted using an ultrasonic 
processor (VC 600, Sonics and Materials, Newtown, CT, USA) with four 
cycles of 60 s sonication (8 s pulses and 5 s pause, 50% Duty Cycle), at 
40% amplitude. Clear lysates, collected after two rounds of centrifuga -
tion at 20,000 x g for 20 and 30 min, respectively, at 4 
◦
C, were loaded 
onto immobilized metal-ion (Co
2 +
) affinity chromatography (IMAC) 
columns (Talon, Clontech; 1.0 cm i.d., 15 cm length) equilibrated with 
the same buffer. The columns were then washed with buffer and imid -
azole of varying concentration, 0 – 100 mM, as previously described [35] . 
The purity of the isolated Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
was confirmed by 
sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE), using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins concen -
tration was calculated through conversion of the absorbance at 280 nm, 
via the molar extinction coefficient of the enzymes, determined by 
ProtParam tool from ExPASy [36] . The fractions containing the purified 
enzymes were dialyzed for 16 h at 4 ℃ against a 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 
150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole buffer, for Dm PETase, and a 25 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl buffer, for LCC
ICCG
. 
2.3. Biochemical characterization of recombinant DmPETase and 
LCC
ICCG 
The cutinase activity of the enzymes was assayed using 1 mM p - 
nitrophenyl butyrate ( p NPB) in 0.1 M phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 6.0), 
at 35 
◦
C for 10 min, by adding 20 μ L of enzyme preparation in 230 μ L of 
substrate solution, and monitoring the release of p -nitrophenol ( p NP) at 
410 nm in a SpectraMax-250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, 
Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with SoftMaxPro software (version 1.1, 
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Enzymatic activity is 
expressed in Units (U) as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μ mol of p NP 
per minute. 
Kinetic studies on Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
were performed with p - 
nitrophenyl water-soluble fatty acid esters with varying chain lengths, 
including p- nitrophenyl acetate ( p NPA), p NPB, p -nitrophenyl octanoate 
( p NPO) and p -nitrophenyl decanoate ( p NPD), which have two, four, 
eight and ten carbon atoms, respectively, under standard p NP assay 
conditions. Estimation of kinetic constants was accomplished through a 
non-linear regression model in GraphPad Prism 5 from GraphPad Soft -
ware, Inc (USA). 
The optimum temperature and pH of Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
were 
determined by assaying enzyme activity on p NPB, under standard p NP 
assay conditions, in varying temperatures (30 – 90 
◦
C) and pH values 
(5.0 – 9.0). Buffer systems used were 0.1 M citrate-phosphate (C-P, pH 
5.0 – 6.0), 0.1 M sodium-phosphate (S-P, pH 6.0 – 8.0) and 0.1 M Tris-HCl 
(T-H, pH 8.0 – 9.0). The thermostability of Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
was 
studied by measuring their residual activity, under standard p NP assay 
conditions, after incubation in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl 
buffer at temperatures ranging from 20
◦
to 80
◦
C for up to 72 h. The 
effect of pH on the enzyme stability was studied by measuring enzymes 
residual activity, under standard p NP assay conditions, after their in -
cubation in different buffer systems in the range of pH 5.0 – 10.0 for 24 h 
at 4 
◦
C. Buffer systems used were 0.2 M citrate-phosphate (C-P, pH 
3.0 – 6.0), 0.2 M sodium-phosphate (S-P, pH 6.0 – 8.0), 0.2 M Tris-HCl (T- 
H, pH 8.0 – 9.0) and 0.2 M glycine-NaOH (G-N, pH 9.0 – 10.0). Residual 
activity was then compared to the one of standard storage buffers, as 
described in paragraph 2.2. 
2.4. Polymeric materials 
2.4.1. Synthetic aliphatic polyesters, aliphatic-aromatic polyether and post- 
consumer PET 
The initial form of target commercial synthetic aliphatic polyesters 
and aliphatic-aromatic polyether was pellets, except for amorphous PET 
film. Polyesters tested included aged PBS (initial grade NaturePlast 
PBE003, NaturePlast, France), PCL (CAPA 6500, Ravago Chemicals, 
Belgium), PET
I 
(PAPET clear, Lotte Chemical, UK), PET
II 
(destined for 
blow molding to commercial beverage bottle), PHB (Biomer P226, 
Biomer, Germany), PLA (4043D, NatureWorks, USA) and polyether PU 
(LPR7560, Coim, Laripur). The post-consumer PET used in this study 
was obtained from commercial, transparent and colored, water bottles. 
2.4.2. Preparation and pretreatment of target polymers 
To prepare the target polymers in powder form, pellets of PBS, PCL, 
PET
I
, PET
II
, PHB and PLA, amorphous PET film, as well as whole pieces 
of transparent and colored, post-consumer PET bottles (excluding caps 
and labels) were initially immersed in liquid nitrogen and subsequently 
milled in a PULVERISETTE 14 (FRITSCH Corp., Idar-Oberstein, Ger -
many) at 17,000 rpm, supplementing liquid nitrogen in order to avoid 
sintering. Resulting powders (particle size < 500 µ m ) of PBS, PCL, PET
I 
(cPET), PET
II 
(bPET), PHB, PLA and amorphous PET film (aPET) were 
dried under vacuum (300 mbar) under variable time and temperature 
conditions; PBS and PLA at 80 
◦
C for 5 h, PCL at 40 
◦
C for 24 h, aPET and 
cPET at 140 
◦
C for 8 h, PHB at 60 
◦
C for 2 h and PU at 90 
◦
C for 3 h. 
In order to investigate post-consumer PET degradation, pieces were 
hole-punched from various parts of the bottle, including the neck, 
shoulder, body and bottom ( Figs. S1 and S2 ). This sampling approach 
facilitated the examination of potential variations in PET degradation 
across different regions of the bottle. Resulting pieces from transparent 
bottle ’ s shoulder (tsPET), body (tbdPET), and bottom (tbtPET), as well 
as colored bottle ’ s shoulder (gsPET), body (gbdPET), and bottom 
(gbtPET) were all characterized by a diameter of 3.5 mm, while pieces 
from transparent and colored bottle ’ s neck, tnPET and gnPET, respec -
tively, had a diameter of 3.0 mm. For the degradation of PET chips, it 
was assumed that enzymatic degradation occurs on the surface of the 
chips, with chips ’ thickness being considered negligible. 
2.4.3. Properties of target polymers 
The characterization of all materials ( Table S1 ), including the 
determination of polymers ’ average molecular weight ( M
n
), melting 
points of first and second heating cycle ( T
m 1 
and T
m 2
), relevant mass 
fraction crystallinity ( x
c
, %), crystallization point ( T
c
) and crystalliza -
tion enthalpy ( Δ H
c
, J g
-1
), was conducted in accordance with the 
methodologies outlined previously [37] . All samples were tested in 
duplicates. 
2.5. Enzymatic hydrolysis of polymeric materials 
2.5.1. Synthetic polyesters and polyether polyurethane materials 
Enzymatic reactions were performed with 10 mg mL
-1 
of polymeric 
powder (PBS, PCL, PHB, PLA, PU) in 0.1 M sodium-phosphate buffer pH 
7.0, at 50
◦
C, under agitation (1350 rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer 
Comfort (Eppendorf, Germany) for 72 h. Reactions, of 0.5 mL, were 
initiated by the addition of 0.5 nmol of enzyme, while another 0.25 nmol 
were supplemented after 24 and 48 h. After 72 h (except for PCL re -
actions at 24 h) the residual material was isolated by centrifugation, 
triple washed with ultrapure water (Labaqua HPLC, ultrapure water 
system, Biosan, Latvia) and freeze-dried (Freeze dryer ALPHA 1 – 4, 
Braun Biotech International, Germany). 
Biodegradation of synthetic polyesters was evaluated through mass 
loss and alteration of polymer ’ s number average molecular weight ( M
n
) 
and weight average ( M
w
), determined by Gel permeation chromatog -
raphy (GPC). GPC was performed using two PLgel MIXED-D 5 µ m

. A refractive index detector 
(RID) (G7162A) at 650 nm, in an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC instrument 
(Agilent Technologies, Germany) was utilized, calibrated with poly -
styrene standards of molecular weight from 162 to 500.000 g/mol 
(EasiVial PS-M 2 mL, Great Britain). Samples, 2 mg mL

by dissolving the residual powders in THF or CHCl

, using an Ultrasonic 
cleaner WUC-1,2 – 22 Litre 40 kHz (witeg Laboerthechnik GmbH, Ger -
many) and filtered through 0.2 µ m syringe filters. 
2.5.2. Virgin and post-consumer PET materials 
Enzymatic reactions were conducted with 10 mg mL
-1 
of virgin and 
post-consumer PET powders (aPET, cPET, tPET, gPET and bPET) or post- 
consumer PET bottle pieces (tnPET, tsPET, tbdPET, tbtPET, gnPET, 
gsPET, gbdPET and gbtPET) in 0.1 M sodium-phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 
at 50
◦
C, under agitation (1350 rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer 
Comfort (Eppendorf, Germany) for 72 h. Post-consumer PET samples 
were initially washed three times using ultrapure water solution with 
1% SDS and 20% ethanol, subsequently triple washed with ultrapure 
water and finally freeze-dried. Reactions of 0.5 mL were initiated by the 
addition of 0.5 nmol of enzyme, while, in some cases, another 0.25 nmol 
were supplemented after 24 and 48 h, in order to investigate the 
importance of enzyme renewal in biodegradation performance as well as 
catalyst ’ s stability. After 72 h the enzymatic reaction was terminated by 
adding HCl 6 M at a final concentration of 0.1% v/v, the supernatant 
was separated from the residual material with centrifugation and sup -
plemented with 5% v/v DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide, > = 99.9% purity, 
Fischer Chemical, U.K.). PET powder was triple washed with ultrapure 
water (Labaqua HPLC, ultrapure water system, Biosan, Latvia) and 
freeze-dried. 
Biodegradation of PET was evaluated through weight loss and 
quantification of the water-soluble hydrolysis products, determined by 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC performed 
using a C-18 reverse-phase NUCLEOSIL ® 100 – 5 (Macherey-Nagel, Ger -
many) with mobile phase 20% v/v acetonitrile ( > = 99.9% purity, 
Fischer Chemical, U.K.), 20% v/v 10 mM sulfuric acid (S.G. 1.84, > =
95% purity, Fischer Chemical, U.K.) in 60% v/v ultrapure water at a 
flow rate of 0.8 mL min
-1
, using a photodiode array detector Varian 
ProStar at 241 nm, in an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC instrument (Agilent 
Technologies, Germany). Quantification of PET degradation products 
was performed through calibration curves with standard concentrations 
in the range of 0.01 – 1 mM. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Unique structural characteristics of the phylogenetically distinct 
DmPETase 
For expression and characterization, the UniProtKB sequence with ID 
E8U72, belonging to D. maricopensis LB-34 strain, was selected. The 
sequence was annotated as a triacylglycerol lipase and BLASTp against 
UniProtKB/SwissProt database revealed 60% identity to PET hydrolases 
from Thermobifida species and LCC. This sequence has also been pointed 
out as a potential PET hydrolase by a previous study [38] . Phylogenetic 
analysis of characterized PET-degrading enzymes, with known 3D 
structure, using the Neighbor-Joining method, shows two distinct 
branches. One contains thermophilic enzymes and the other 
non-thermophilic enzymes belonging to Burkholderiales and marine 
γ -proteobacteria. In the thermophilic branch, the D. maricopensis enzyme 
forms its own distinct sub-branch, while the other contains enzymes 
from thermophilic actinomycetes and metagenomic or unidentified 
sources ( Fig. S3 ). 
The overall structure of Dm PETase, as predicted by AF2, is nearly 
identical to other bacterial cutinases, with a root-mean-square deviation 
(rmsd) of 0.737 Å with LCC
ICCG 
(PDB ID: 7w1n) and 0.644 Å with 
Is PETase (PDB ID: 6eqh), as representative thermophilic and mesophilic 
PET-hydrolases (LCC
ICCG 
with Is PETase have a rmsd of 0.893 Å). The 
catalytic triad in Dm PETase is Ser185, His263 and Asp231, and the 
enzyme contains a single disulfide bond (DB) between cysteines Cys296- 
Cys312, which is common to the other two enzymes and one of the 
characteristics that distinguish PET hydrolases into two different classes 
(type I and type II) [23] . The wild-type LCC is a type I PET hydrolase, 
containing one BD, but LCC
ICCG 
has a second DB introduced through 
site-specific engineering at positions 238 (Asp238Cys) and 283 
(Ser283Cys). Is PETase, on the other hand is a type II PET hydrolase, its 
second DB formed between Cys203 and Cys239 ( Fig. 1 A). 
When comparing the substrate-binding cleft of Dm PETase to the one 
from LCC
ICCG 
and Is PETase we see that all three enzymes are signifi -
cantly similar. Fig. 1 A highlights the important residues for binding as 
indicated by the complex structure (PDB ID: 7VVE) of LCC
ICCG 
with 2- 
hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) [39] . MHET binds to LCC
ICCG 
through residues Trp190, Val212, His242, Ile243, His164, Ala97, Tyr95 
and Met166, which are the same in Dm PETase (Trp210, Val233, His263, 
His184, Tyr117 and Met186) apart from two; Gly264 and Gly119. The 
position where Gly264 is in Dm PETase, there is Ile243 in LCC
ICCG
, which 
is one of the mutated residues. The Ile243 substitution in LCC
ICCG 
ex -
pands the substrate-binding tunnel and may increase the PET-binding 
capacity, while in the wild-type Dm PETase there is already a smaller 
residue at the same site. Comparing the width of the binding-site at that 
region ( Fig. 1 B), we can see that for LCC
ICCG 
and Is PETase it is 9.3 Å and 
9.5 Å, respectively, while for Dm PETase it is 10.9 Å, which is signifi -
cantly wider. 
Previous research has demonstrated the impact of surface charges on 
the PET-degrading capability of various enzymes [40] . Sagong et al. 
proposed that negatively charged residues distal from the active site 
were more conducive to PET hydrolysis [41] , while other studies sug -
gested that an electrically neutral enzyme surface might reduce elec -
trostatic repulsion with the polymer [42,43] . Fig. S4 illustrates the 
distribution of electrostatic potential on the surface of Dm PETase next to 
that of LCC
ICCG 
and Is PETase. It is evident that both LCC
ICCG 
and Is PE -
Tase have positive charges on their front side, while Dm PETase is mostly 
neutral. Similarly, the bottom side of LCC
ICCG 
and Is PETase is predom -
inantly positively charged, while Dm PETase is mostly neutral with small 
areas of negative and positive charges. A clear distinction can also be 
observed on the top/back side of the enzymes, where Dm PETase has a 
region that is a considerably more negatively charged than the other two 
PET-hydrolases (green circles), whereas there is another small region at 
the top, near the active-site cleft (yellow circles), where Dm PETase is 
slightly less negatively charged than the other two enzymes. Interest -
ingly, despite the fact that LCC
ICCG 
and Is PETase are derived from 
entirely different sources and have very distinct properties, they display 
a remarkably similar electrostatic surface, which is dissimilar to the one 
of Dm PETase. 
In a very recent study, a machine-learning tool in combination with 
evolutionary analysis was used to mutate LCC
ICCG
, aiming in variants 
with increased activity on semi-crystalline PET. The most effective 
variant (LCCICCG_I6M) contained 6 point mutations, namely Asp53Thr, 
Ser67Lys, Ser133Arg, Thr188Pro, Glu208Gln, and Asn249Pro [26] . 
Surprisingly, all positions apart from one (Thr188Pro) are located on the 
surface of the enzyme and mostly involve mutation of uncharged resi -
dues into positively charged or negatively charged residues into un -
charged. At the respective positions Dm PETase contains either polar 
uncharged (Ser88, Gln229, Asn270) or charged residues (Arg74 and 
Asp155). Regardless, this work highlights the effect of surface residues 
on the ability of a PET hydrolase to degrade crystalline PET.

weights (MW) were determined at 31 and 29 kDa, respectively, via their 
appearance as single bands ο n 12% SDS-PAGE gel ( Fig. S5 ).

while LCC

enzymes, especially LCC

and LCC
ICCG 
( Fig. 2 D) respectively, after a 3-day incubation. Regarding 
pH effect, Dm PETase demonstrated maximum activity at pH 6.0, which 
comes in contrast to the conventional trend observed in most well- 
known PETases, mainly cutinases, which exhibit activity peak at 
neutral to slightly alkanine pH values [38,44] , similar to LCC
ICCG 
that 
displayed its highest activity at pH 8.5 ( Fig. 2 B). Both enzymes ’ 
maximum stability was observed for T-H buffer system at pH 9.0 
( Fig. S6 ). The determination of kinetic constants for both Dm PETase and 
LCC
ICCG 
( Table 1 ) on p NPA, p NPB, p NPO and p NPD indicated a typical 
Michaelis-Menten profile. The results demonstrated that both Dm PETase 
and LCC
ICCG 
showed the highest catalytic efficiency towards p NPB fol -
lowed by p NPA, p NPO and p NPD. 
Summing up, Dm PETase ’ s structure, protein sequence and 
biochemical characterization portray a thermophilic cutinase-like 
enzyme [45] . Further information and detailed commentary on 
biochemical characterization of both Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
can be 
found in paragraph S1.1 of Supplementary Material . 
3.3. Ability of DmPETase and LCC
ICCG 
to degrade polyester and 
polyurethane-based plastics 
The capacity of Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
to degrade synthetic poly -
mers was tested for non- and bio-degradable synthetic plastics, including 
polyether PU and polyesters such as PBS, PCL, PHB, PLA. Depolymer -
ization degree of each plastic was assessed based on the percentage dry 
mass loss and changes in molecular weights ( M
n
, M
w
), presented in Fig. 3 
and Table S3 , respectively. 
The results of the degradation study on PCL powder showed that 
LCC
ICCG 
fully degraded (98.7%) the material in just 24 h, while Dm PE -
Tase led to a significant mass loss, degrading approximately 70% of the 
material. The mass loss caused by Dm PETase was also followed by mo -
lecular weight alterations in the remaining material, mainly in M
n
. The 
treatment of PBS powder with LCC
ICCG 
and Dm PETase led to a 79.6% 
and 26.5% mass loss, respectively, which in case of Dm PETase was not 
accompanied by changes in the molecular weight of the residual mate -
rial. The higher crystallinity of PBS (12% higher than PCL, Table S2 ) 
may have made it more resistant to degradation in comparison to PCL, as 
its compact polymer structure would be tougher to break down. The 
degradation of PHB by both Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
resulted in a mass 
loss of approximately 15% with no decrease in molecular weight. PHB 
has the highest initial weight average molecular weight among the 
tested polyesters, probably justifying its lower degradation yields in 
comparison to PBS and PCL. Moreover, the compact polymer backbone 
and presence of methyl side groups near the ester bonds might restrict 
enzyme accessibility. The enzymatic breakdown of PLA was very low as 
both polyesterases caused mass losses around 5%. As with the afore -
mentioned biodegradable polyesters, there was no molecular weight 
variation in the remaining powder. PLA ’ s high molecular weight and T
g
, 
as well as dense backbone, limit its susceptibility to degradation. 
The degradation of the polyether PU powder was evidenced by a 
minor mass loss (2 – 5%), as a result of the enzymatic action of Dm PETase 
and LCC
ICCG
. Although the mass difference was negligible, the decrease 
in M
n 
by Dm PETase was detectable at 8.2%, implying a random cleavage 
mechanism resulting mainly in the release of insoluble products prob -
ably as a result of endo-manner action. Polyether PU, apart from the 
ether bonds, contains urethane bonds, however, (poly)esterases have 
been shown to be able to break this type of bonds too, highlighting their 
versatility [46,47] . 
In conclusion, both the novel Dm PETase and the well-known PET 
degrader LCC
ICCG
, exhibit significant polyesterase activity. To date, 
studies on LCC, have primarily focused on its PET-degrading ability 
rather than other polyester materials. However, our study has demon -
strated that LCC
ICCG 
is more than just a PET hydrolase. Under the same

temperature and enzyme concentration conditions, Dm PETase demon -
strated comparable performance. Despite the fact that all target poly -
esters exhibit diversity in their properties ( Table S2 ) and consequently, 
it is challenging to ascertain which of these play a role in degradation of 
the material, a trend has emerged, wherein both cutinases exhibit a 
higher capacity for hydrolyzing polyesters with ester bonds spanning 
greater distance in their structure and monomers with non-substituted 
carbon atoms. Overall, both polyesterases exhibit similar selectivity 
for various polyesters and the combination of mass loss and molecular 
alterations might indicate a similar depolymerase mechanism for each 
polymer. 
3.4. Comparison of DmPETase with LCC
ICCG 
to degrade amorphous and 
semi-crystalline PET materials 
Polymers ’ crystallinity degree is one of the main factors affecting 
enzymatic hydrolysis by restricting the enzymes ’ access to the hydro -
lyzable bonds [9] . Considering also that PET may exist as amorphous 
and semi-crystalline depending on its processing and thermal conditions 
[48] , a wide range of three virgin (powders) and two post-consumer 
(chips and powders) PET grades with different mass fraction crystal -
linities were examined. Overall, across all tested PET samples, a range of 
crystallinity degrees, spanning from low (6%) to high (40%), was 
observed. All other thermal properties presented significant similarities, 
besides slightly decreased, T
g1 
of post-consumer PET grades compared 
to virgin grades, within rational bounds. A comprehensive discussion of

sent in paragraph S1.2 of Supplementary Material . 
3.4.1. DmPETase degrades the crystalline part of postconsumer PET bottles 
at the same levels as LCC
ICCG 
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Dm PETase and 
LCC
ICCG 
polyesterases in degrading postconsumer PET bottles. Two 
types of water bottles, transparent and a green colored, were employed 
and divided into four different sections, with crystallinity degrees 
ranging from 10% to 31% ( Table S1 ). The degradation of the chips by 
both enzymes was observed over a three-day period, monitoring the 
generation of water-soluble products, the concentration of which is 
presented in Figs. S10 and S11 for transparent and green bottle, 
respectively. 
As expected, the neck was degraded more efficiently by both en -
zymes, compared to the rest of the compartments, as it was the one with 
the lowest crystallinity. LCC
ICCG 
was significantly more active than 
Dm PETase on the neck of both bottle types, resulting in the release of 
approximately 30-fold more hydrolysis products after three days. 
Nevertheless, Dm PETase exhibited comparable efficacy to LCC
ICCG 
in 
degrading the shoulder, body and bottom of both transparent and 
colored PET bottles, with no statistically significant differences in the 
release of hydrolysis products. Degradation of the crystalline parts of 
each bottle did not show statistically important differences, except for 
the degradation of the green bottom compartment by LCC
ICCG
, which 
released 11-fold more products than the green shoulder. Interestingly, 
the degradation of shoulder and body compartments reveals a faster 
hydrolysis rate for LCC
ICCG
, releasing more products in 1.5 days 
compared to Dm PETase, which achieved the same level of degradation 
on the third day. 
The degradation yields of transparent and colored bottles showed 
that parts of the green bottle were more susceptible to biodegradation. 
Specifically, the low crystallinity green bottle neck was 1.4- (from 12.6 
to 17.2 μ g
products
/mm
2
chip
) and 1.6-fold (from 0.44 to 0.71 μ g
products
/ 
mm
2
chip
) more degraded than the respective transparent compartment 
from LCC
ICCG 
and Dm PETase, respectively. Apart from this, the green 
body part was hydrolyzed by Dm PETase 6.4 times more (from 1 to 
6 ng
products
/mm
2
chip
) than the transparent one. 
However, the overall degradation yields were low even for the low 
crystallinity compartments, resulting in only 1 – 2% degradation. Apart 
from crystallinity degree, the crystalline morphology can also be a sig -
nificant factor in thermally crystallized PET, as it is the unstretched PET 
bottle neck crystallization temperature prior to blow-molding affects 
spherulites size and number. In samples of equivalent low crystallinity 
values, larger spherulites offer greater geometric impedance to mass 
transfer phenomena, something that is observed in PET oxygen perme -
ability studies for x
c 
< 20 – 30% [49] . For the stretched and heat parts of 
the bottle (shoulder, body, bottom) strain-induced crystallization has 
happened during the stretch-blow molding, and the polymer chains are 
rearranged in parallel being closely packed affecting thus enzyme ’ s 
accessibility to the hydrolysable bonds. Furthermore, even though both 
enzymes degraded the crystalline parts of the bottles to the same extent, 
the yields did crystalline morphology of the bottles. 
3.4.2. DmPETase activity is affected less by crystallinity increase compared 
to LCC
ICCG 
To investigate the effect of material morphology and crystallinity on 
enzyme activity, a subsequent investigation was performed by milling 
the bottles into powder and comparing with other PET materials of 
variable crystallinities, ranging from amorphous (7%) to semi- 
crystalline (41%), most of which are involved in bottle production. 
With milling, the different crystalline morphology of the stretched and 
unstretched bottle compartments obviously does not change, but the 
specific surface area for enzymatic degradation increases. The degree of 
depolymerization of each PET sample was assessed based on the amount 
of released water-soluble products released, as presented in Fig. 4 and  
Table 2 . 
The results demonstrate that Dm PETase was able to degrade all 
tested PET samples, leading to the release of substantial amounts of 
water-soluble products. Table 2 shows that both Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
exhibited the highest activity towards amorphous PET powder, pro -
ducing a total of 119 μ g/mgPET and 414 μ g/mgPET water-soluble 
products, respectively. As the crystallinity of PET increased from 6% 
(aPET) to 21% (tPET and gPET), there was a 2.2- and 3.3-fold reduction 
in hydrolysis products by Dm PETase and a 2.5- and 4.2-fold reduction by 
LCC
ICCG
, respectively. Notably, a further escalation of crystallinity to 
40% (cPET), resulted in a 15.3- and 22.6-fold decrease in PET degra -
dation activity for Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG
, respectively. Specifically, 
Dm PETase was able to degrade semi-crystalline PET, producing hydro -
lysis products at a concentration of 30.3 μ g/mgPET, while LCC
ICCG 
generated hydrolysis products at a concentration of 35.0 μ g/mgPET. As 
anticipated, the progressive increase of PET crystallinity corresponded 
to a limitation of enzymatic degradation, as evidenced by the reduction 
in hydrolysis product concentration for both enzymes. It is worth noting 
that the correlation between the increase in PET crystallinity and the 
yield of degradation was exponential for both enzymes ( Fig. S12 ), but 
the decrease was sharper for LCC
ICCG
. Specifically, a significant 4-fold 
increase in crystallinity, from 6% (aPET) to 21% (tPET, gPET), led to

a slight 2- to 4-fold decrease in enzymatic activity of both enzymes, 
while a further increase in crystallinity to 40%, caused a substantial 
reduction of dozens of times. 
These findings are consistent with previous studies, which demon -
strate that PET crystallinity levels up to 20% may facilitate effective 
degradation, whereas higher values are associated with a significant 
reduction in enzymatic degradation yield [31] . Nevertheless, the 
depolymerization results of bPET, with a x
c 
of 36%, contradict this 
trend, as despite its similar crystallinity to cPET ( x
c 
of 40%), its degra -
dation capacity dropped by 2- and 4-fold by Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG
, 
respectively. This outcome could be attributed to various material 
properties, such as the increased hygroscopicity and moisture absorp -
tion of cPET (according to the material datasheet), which potentially 
facilitated the diffusion of the enzymatic solution through cPET powder 
particles during the reaction, leading to more efficient degradation. 
Emphasizing on post-consumer bottles, both Dm PETase and LCC
ICCG 
demonstrated efficient degradation with 3 – 5% and 10 – 15% degradation 
yields, respectively, indicating that milling of the bottles, even without 
quenching, significantly enhances enzymatic degradation performance, 
due to the increase of the available surface area. Grinding of transparent 
and green bottle enhanced degradation by Dm PETase by 93- and 35-fold 
respectively, while LCC
ICCG 
breakdown action was increased by 10- and 
5-fold respectively, comparing to the sum of the hole-punched samples 
from various bottle compartments. In contrast to the bottle pieces case 
study, where the green bottle appeared more susceptible to biodegra -
dation, the results from the powder hydrolysis suggested that the 
transparent bottle was degraded about 1.5-fold more, compared to green 
bottle powder, by both enzymes. It is possible that colorants, wax dis -
persants, and copolymer additives, which are perceptible in colored PET 
[50] , might be released with grinding, possibly impeding enzymatic 
action. 
Focusing more on the enzymatic perspective, Fig. 5 highlights that 
the degrading activity of Dm PETase on amorphous PET is approximately 
3.5-fold lower than that of LCC
ICCG
. However, LCC
ICCG 
displays 3.0 and 
2.5 times more efficient enzymatic degradation of transparent and green 
PET bottle powders, respectively. LCC
ICCG 
also exhibits 2.3 times higher 
efficacy towards bPET powder with 36.5% crystallinity. These obser -
vations suggest that LCC
ICCG 
exhibits stronger PET-degrading activity 
than Dm PETase in these samples, but also reveal an underlying trend 
between the correlation of enzymes ’ PET activity. Specifically, the ratio 
of LCC
ICCG 
to Dm PETase hydrolysis products decreases with increasing 
crystallinity, indicating that LCC
ICCG 
PET-degrading activity is strongly 
impacted by crystallinity alteration, whereas Dm PETase exhibits less 
sensitivity to this change. Indeed, this trend is confirmed as notably both 
PET-hydrolases have the same degrading efficiency towards the most 
crystalline PET sample (cPET-40%). 
Overall, our findings indicate that LCC
ICCG 
demonstrates significant 
degradation yields in low crystallinity PET, which is expected as the 
variant was engineered to specifically target the hydrolysis of amorph -
ized post-consumer PET. However, the crystallinity degree of cPET 
(41%), considerably reduces LCC
ICCG
’ s degradation efficiency, likely by 
impeding enzyme approach to the material, as evidenced by a 10-fold 
lower product release compared to aPET. Conversely, although Dm PE -
Tase shows a lower degradation yield on aPET, it seems to exhibit 
greater affinity for semi-crystalline PET materials with only a 4-fold 
lower yield. This difference can be attributed to the distinct electro -
static surface properties of the two enzymes. The combination of a lower 
degradation rate but better affinity to semi-crystalline PET balances 
LCC
ICCG
’ s activity on cPET. As a result, Dm PETase was demonstrated to 
be equally effective in degrading semi-crystalline PET as LCC
ICCG
. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, the investigation of a novel promising PETase from the 
bacterium D. maricopensis ( Dm PETase) was reported. While homologous 
to many characterized thermophilic PET-degrading enzymes, Dm PETase 
displays unique characteristics forming its own sub-branch on the 
phylogenetic tree and displaying dissimilar electrostatic surface to well- 
known benchmark PETases. Dm PETase characterization depicted a 
thermostable cutinase-like enzyme with the ability to degrade various 
synthetic polymers. Focusing on PET, Dm PETase was capable of 
degrading crystalline compartments of PET bottles, as well as semi-

, an industrially 
relevant enzyme, while getting less affected by PET crystallinity grade. 
These findings surpass previous reports and establish Dm PETase as a 
promising enzymatic platform for protein engineering, mainly around 
its active cite, enhancing PET degradation rate in combination with the 
enzyme ’ s natural high affinity to semi-crystalline PET. 
Environmental implication 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used synthetic polymer, 
particularly hazardous as it accumulates in the environment, causing 
harm to both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Enzymatic degradation 
has been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional waste 
management strategies, which have proven inadequate in tackling the 
plastic-waste problem. By identifying a thermophilic enzyme capable of 
degrading semi-crystalline materials and post-consumer PET bottles, 
without the need for amorphization, this work proposes a more energy- 
effective alternative for biocatalytic PET-waste reduction.
