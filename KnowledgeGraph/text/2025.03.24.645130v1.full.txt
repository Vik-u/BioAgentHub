Abstract 12 
Synthetic polymers, such as plastics, are ubiquitous materials that are used in many applications. 13 
The sustainable use of plastics is becoming increasingly important given the emergent issues of 14 
environmental pollution by microplastics and the limited resources of petroleum on Earth. One 15 
of the key strategies for the sustainable use of plastics is recycling. Enzymatic degradation is a 16 
promising technique for recycling plastic because this process requires neither energy nor harsh 17 
solvents, such as strong alkaline solutions and organic solvents. In this study, the enzymatic 18 
degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a major plastic used in daily life, was 19 
investigated, aiming to improve the efficiency of enzymatic degradation by understanding the 20 
decay of the polymeric PET structure. The structural decay of an amorphous PET film induced 21 
by a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme (PETase) was analyzed using wide-angle X-ray diffraction 22 
(WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), electron microscopy, and X-ray computed 23 
tomography (X-ray CT). Structural decay progressed from the surface of the film, and many 24 
nested pores (10-8‒10-5 m) were found in the later stage of degradation, reflecting the structural 25 
difference between the surface and core of the material. Information regarding the polymeric 26 
structure of the plastic under enzymatic degradation is important for improving the degradation 27 
performance of enzymes for realizing the biochemical recycling of plastics such as PET.  28

1. Introduction  43 
Synthetic polymers and plastics are important materials in our daily lives. Massive 44 
amounts of plastics are produced from petroleum, which is a limited resource. Accordingly, 45 
securing a supply of raw materials that can replace petroleum or naphtha is becoming increasingly 46 
important for sustainable life. Another issue with the use of plastics is environmental pollution. 47 
Ocean plastics are a major environmental pollutant and social issue owing to their significant 48 
threat to marine organisms [1, 2]. The impact on human health has also been debated [3]. 49 
Therefore, conserving natural resources and reducing the emission of environmental pollutants 50 
are important for the sustainable use of plastics in the future.  51 
Thus, a circular plastic economy must be realized [4, 5] to secure raw materials for 52 
regenerating plastics and reduce the leakage of plastics into the environment. Poly(ethylene 53 
terephthalate) (PET) is a popular plastic that is widely used in food packaging, including drink 54 
bottles and cost-effective clothing. In Japan, PET is the third most common marine plastic waste 55 
in coastal waters, after polyethylene and polypropylene [6], and the situation is expected to 56 
be similar in other countries.  57 
There are two types of PET recycling systems: mechanical and chemical [7]. In the 58 
mechanical recycling of PET, PET materials such as drink bottles are reshaped by heating after 59 
fragmentation into flakes. This process is relatively simple and is the primary method for 60 
recycling PET. However, the process of mechanically crushing the material into smaller flakes 61 
for efficient thermal reshaping is a potential origin of microplastics in the environment and a 62 
possible issue in achieving a highly sustainable society with plastics. In contrast, for chemical 63 
recycling, the used PET material is first disintegrated into monomers or oligomers via chemical 64 
reactions. The obtained monomers and oligomers are recovered and polymerized to regenerate 65 
PET. This process can maximize the recycling efficiency because it can be applied to various 66 
materials (colored bottles, yarns, textiles, films, etc.). However, the process is costly because of 67

the energy and chemicals required to disintegrate the used PET materials and recover the 68 
monomers and oligomers.  69 
 Recently, enzymatic degradation has attracted considerable attention as an efficient tool 70 
for disintegrating PET materials under mild conditions for chemical recycling. After the initial 71 
discovery of a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme in a biomass-degrading bacterium Thermobiﬁda fusca 72 
[8], many studies using life-science strategies have reported PET-hydrolyzing enzymes, hereafter 73 
called PETase, based on bacterial screening [9], metagenomic screening [10], and rational design 74 
by site-directed mutagenesis [11, 12]. The mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis of PET molecules 75 
is well debated and deeply understood [13-15]. These studies have provided impetus for 76 
improving the enzymatic activity of PETase using life-science strategies ; however, only basic 77 
characterizations, such as analysis of the weight loss, surface morphology, and crystallinity using 78 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been performed [9, 11], and little attention has been 79 
paid to the decay of the higher structures of PET by PETase.  80 
 Given the current situation, the authors propose that the structure of PET materials is an 81 
important factor that governs the enzymatic degradability and properties of PET ; thus, in-depth 82 
analysis of the structural changes of PET materials during degradation by PETase is warranted. 83 
In this study, a multiscale analysis of the structural decay of an amorphous PET film by PETase 84 
was conducted using Fast-PETase [11] as a model enzyme, which is an improved variant of 85 
IsPETase from a bacterium Ideonera sakaiensis (discovered at a PET bottle recycling site) [9], by 86 
machine-learning. The model PET substrate used in this study is a lab-made, amorphous film that 87 
has been intensively analyzed in polymer science [16-18]. Using this experimental setup, this 88 
study aims to clarify how PETase disintegrates the polymer structure of PET.   89

2. Materials and Methods  90 
All chemicals used in this study were purchased from Fujifilm Wako Chemicals (Tokyo, 91 
Japan), Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), and Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, US), unless 92 
otherwise indicated. Tryptone and yeast extracts for the bacterial cultures were purchased from 93 
Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Imidazole for protein purification was purchased 94 
from Calbiochem, Inc. (Rahway, NJ, USA).  95 
 96 
2.1. Preparation of PET substrate  97 
PET pellets were purchased from Scientific Polymer Products Inc. (NY , USA; catalog 98 
#: 138; inherent viscosity: 0.58) and subjected to melt-quenching to prepare amorphous PET films. 99 
Firstly, approximately 60 mg of the PET pellets were sandwiched between a pair comprising 100 
Kapton film, glass slides, and copper plates; the Kapton film touched the PET pellets directly, and 101 
the copper plates exposed to the outside were used for efficient heat transfer. This sandwich was 102 
placed on a heating plate and maintained at 300 °C for ca. 2 min and manually pressed with 103 
forceps to remove visible air bubbles. Thereafter, the sandwich of PET in the Kapton film was 104 
quickly placed between the copper plates at room temperature ( ca. 20 °C), which is lower than 105 
the glass transition temperature of PET (ca. 75 °C). This melt-quenched amorphous film, which 106 
typically had a thickness of 150 µm and a round shape with a radius of 10 mm, was evenly cut 107 
with scissors into 8 fan-shaped pieces and used as the substrate in the degradation experiment.  108

2.2. Purification of PETase 110 
2.2.1. Cloning of Fast-PETase  111 
 The PETase used in this study is a previously reported Fast-PETase [11], which is a 112 
highly thermostable variant of IsPETase. The first 27 amino acid residues were truncated as 113 
previously described [11] because this region was predicted to be a signal peptide by SignalP6.0 114

[19]. The DNA sequence of Fast-PETase without the signal peptide sequence was synthesized by 115 
Eurofins Genomics Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) with codon optimization in Escherichia coli. The DNA 116 
of the codon-optimized Fast-PETase gene was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites in the 117 
cloning site of the pET-28b plasmid (Millipore Inc.) by restriction enzyme treatment and 118 
subsequent ligation.  119 
 120 
2.2.2. Expression of recombinant PETase protein in Escherichia coli 121 
 The pET-28b plasmid carrying Fast-PETase, prepared as described in Section 2.2.1, was 122 
introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The E. coli transformants carrying this plasmid 123 
DNA were selected based on kanamycin resistance on LB agar plate, and used for expressing 124 
recombinant Fast-PETase protein.  125 
 The transformant was precultured in LB liquid medium with 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 126 
37 °C with orbital shaking at 200 rpm. In a typical experiment, 0.5 mL of the preculture was 127 
transferred into 50 mL of fresh 2× YT medium with 25 μg/mL kanamycin in a 300 mL flask 128 
without baffles. The flask was maintained at 37 °C in an orbital shaker with agitation at 200 rpm 129 
until the OD600 reached 0.6‒0.8, after which isopropyl thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) was added to 130 
a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression. The culture was then maintained at 131 
20 °C for ca. 20 h in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. Finally, the cultured E. coli cells were collected 132 
by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C and kept in a freezer at −80 °C until use.  133 
 The frozen cells were thawed on ice and suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 134 
containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5–10 mM imidazole. The cell suspension 135 
was ultrasonicated to disrupt the cells, centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the 136 
unbroken cells, and the supernatant was filtered using Miracloth (Merck Inc.). Hexahistidine-137 
tagged Fast-PETase in the clarified lysate was purified using immobilized metal affinity 138 
chromatography (IMAC). Ni-Sepharose (Cytiva, Inc. Marlborough, MA, US) was placed in a 139

plastic column (Poly-Prep column; Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA, US) and equilibrated with 5–10 140 
mM imidazole in PBS. The clarified lysate was then applied to Ni-Sepharose in the column to 141 
bind the tagged Fast-PETase. The Ni-Sepharose was then washed with PBS containing 20 mM 142 
imidazole, and the tagged Fast-PETase was eluted with PBS containing 300 mM imidazole. 143 
IMAC-purified Fast-PETase was applied to BioGel P-4 or P-6 resin (BioRad Inc.) in a spin 144 
column and centrifuged at 1,000× g to exchange the buffer with PBS (without imidazole). The 145 
concentration of Fast-PETase was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction 146 
coefficient of 1.4 (mg/ml)-1∙cm-1.  147 
 148 
2.3. Enzymatic treatment of PET 149 
 The fast-PETase purified as described in Section 2.2 was reconstituted at a concentration 150 
of 500 nM in 100 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH8.0), and the amorphous film prepared as per 151 
Section 2.1 was immersed in this reaction buffer in a 1.5 mL polypropylene microtube. The 152 
reaction was conducted at 50 °C by placing the reaction microtubes in an air-phase incubator 153 
without exchanging the reaction buffer with fresh enzyme, and the PET film was removed from 154 
the reaction buffer at the desired time. The film was washed briefly with water and dried in air for 155 
at least 15 min, weighed using an electronic balance, and photographed using a digital camera. 156 
The dried PET film was subjected to structural analyses.  157

2.4.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 160 
 The sample treated with Fast-PETase was fixed on a copper stub using electron-161 
conductive glue (DOTITE, Fujikura Kasei Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); the sample was coated with 162 
platinum using a JEC-3000FC coater (JEOL Inc., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) that was operated at 163 
20 mA for 90 s with the rotating sample stage at a tilt angle of 45° for 45 s and then at 0° for 164

another 45 s.  165 
 The platinum-coated samples were observed using a JSM-7800F prime (JEOL Inc.) 166 
instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 keV and a working distance of 6 mm. Some 167 
images were captured from the side direction by fixing the sample film perpendicularly on a 168 
copper stub with a working distance of 10 mm.  169 
 170 
2.4.2. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT)  171 
 Micro-X-ray computed tomography (CT) was performed at BL8S2 of the Aichi 172 
Synchrotron Radiation Center (Aichi SRC, Seto, Aichi, Japan). Briefly, the sample was set on a 173 
rotational stage and illuminated with white X-rays (6–24 keV). The transmitted images were 174 
recorded with sample rotation from 0 to 360° at an interval of 0.1° using an ORCA-Flash4.0 175 
sCMOS image sensor (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan)) with a zoom 176 
lens: the pixel size corresponds to 0.65 μm 2. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the obtained 177 
image dataset was performed at the beamline using TomoPy, which is a Python package for X-178 
ray CT image analysis and image reconstruction [20]. Three-dimensional volumetric data were 179 
visualized using Fiji [21] and Molcer (WhiteRabit Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for visual inspection.  180 
 181 
2.4.3. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)  182 
 Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) 183 
analyses were performed at the synchrotron facility, BL40B2, of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The 184 
wavelength of the X-rays used in this study was 1 Å and the scattering/diffraction patterns were 185 
recorded with a Pilatus3 S 2M instrument (Dectris Inc., Switzerland). The exposure times were 186 
10 s and 5 s for SAXS and WAXD, respectively.  187 
The scattering/diffraction patterns were circularly averaged using a beamline program 188 
and corrected for absorbance. Given the scattering vector q = (4π sin θ)/λ, where θ and λ are half 189

3. Results and Discussion 194 
3.1. Weight-loss and visual inspection of amorphous PET film after Fast-PETase treatment 195 
 First, the weight loss of the amorphous PET film treated with purified Fast-PETase was 196 
evaluated (Figure 1), conforming the significant PET-degrading activity of the Fast-PETase used 197 
in this study. Visual inspection also demonstrated a change from the clear appearance of the PET 198 
film before degradation to white after degradation by Fast-PETase, where the whiteness became 199 
more pronounced after degradation (Figure 1), consistent with prior reports [9].  200 
Two mechanisms were hypothesized for this phenomenon: (i) an increase in the 201 
crystallinity upon degradation and (ii) the formation of a structure with voids having dimensions 202 
on the order of the wavelength of visible light (~10 -7 m) in the PET film sample. Given a lower 203 
glass transition temperature for the surface of a polymer film [22], crystallization might be 204 
possible under the glass transition temperature of PET (ca. 50 °C) and was tested as a reason for 205 
whitening in this study. The residual PET films were analyzed using WAXD, X-ray CT, SEM, 206 
and SAXS to test these hypotheses. Furthermore, the structural changes in the PET film due to 207 
enzymatic degradation were tracked over the reaction time.  208

 212 
3.2. WAXD analysis 213 
First, the fine structure of the film was assessed using WAXD to test the hypothesis that 214 
the increased turbidity of the film induced by Fast-PETase was due to the increased crystallinity 215 
of PET. The WAXD profile of PET before degradation (Figure 2A) shows no sharp peaks, but a 216 
broad peak composed of a number of diffraction peaks, indicating that the melt-quench film is 217 
amorphous. The intensity of the broad diffraction peak decreased with the degradation time 218 
(Figure 2A), indicating that PET molecules were gradually removed from the film by Fast-PETase. 219 
However, the sharpness of the WAXD profile did not change significantly, indicating that the film 220 
remained highly amorphous after degradation. Thus, the turbidity of the PET film observed after 221 
degradation by Fast-PETase was not caused by increased crystallinity of PET.  222 
The small difference in the WAXD profiles at different enzymatic degradation times 223 
suggests that Fast-PETase evenly degraded the amorphous PET film on a scale observable by 224 
WAXD. In other words, Fast-PETase seems to have no preference for more crystalline PET 225 
substrates when degrading PET. This is in contrast to cellulose-degrading enzymes such as 226 
cellobiohydrolase, which degrade crystalline cellulose more effectively than endoglucanase [23]. 227 
Such variability in enzymatic properties is important for the effective degradation of native 228 
cellulose, a long crystalline fiber [24].  229 
For detailed analysis of the change in the diffraction profile, all WAXD profiles were 230 
normalized relative to the most intense peak (Figure 2B). Notably, the profiles for degradation at 231 
15.5, 26.5, 55.2, and 64.5 h were completely superimposable, whereas a slight increase in the 232 
diffraction intensity was observed in a limited q-region around 1.75 Å-1 between 0 h and 15.5 h 233 
(indicated by the arrow in Figure 2B). This small increase in the diffraction intensity is plausibly 234

due to broadening of the amorphous hallow, suggesting a slight enhancement in the disorder of 235 
the PET molecules at the beginning of degradation. Given that this change was very small and 236 
occurred only at an earlier stage, the enhanced disorder due to PETase-induced degradation may 237 
have resulted from the removal of the outer surface layer of the PET film. Such a change, specific 238 
to the earlier stage of degradation, was also observed in the SEM and SAXS analyses, as shown 239 
in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, respectively.  240

the solid lines indicate PET degraded for 15.5 h, 26.5 h, 55.2 h, and 64.5 h; all profiles 246 
were similar. The arrow indicates the q-region where the diffraction intensity increased 247 
after degradation.  248 
 249 
3.3. Micro X-ray CT analysis  250 
Given the WAXD results, the structural changes were analyzed on a larger scale. X-ray 251 
CT demonstrated that the surface morphology of the PET film was flat and smooth before 252 
degradation (Figure 3). During degradation, the film gradually became thinner and exhibited a 253

rougher surface. In most parts of the film, no significant void spaces were observed (Figure 3A–254 
D). These observations indicate that the erosion of the PET film by Fast-PETase primarily 255 
occurred at the surface.  256

Serial cross-sections with an interval of 1.3 μm for the film degraded for 55.2 h.  260 
 261 
However, using X-ray CT, some void spaces were observed in the films subjected to a 262 
longer degradation time (Figure 3E–3H), suggesting degradation of the PET film by Fast-PETase, 263 
not only on the surface but also within the film. The reconstructed X-ray CT data showed that the 264 
voids within the film were disconnected from the outside. Given that no void space was observed 265 
in the X-ray CT data before degradation of the PET film, the voids are thought to be generated by 266 
Fast-PETase. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the pores were too small to be visualized using 267 
X-ray CT (nominally 0.65 μm pixel size): the Fast-PETase protein has a size of about 3 nm. 268 
Plausibly, the void space observed in the film using X-ray CT is not due to an experimental artifact 269

but represents the action of Fast-PETase. Therefore, it can be concluded that gradual erosion from 270 
the surface is the major mode by which Fast-PETase attacks the PET film; however, erosion inside 271 
the film sometimes occurs at a later stage of the reaction.  272 
Moreover, one side of the film surface became rougher than the other as the reaction 273 
progressed (Figure 4A–4D). Although this indicates a difference in the rate of structural decay of 274 
the two surfaces of the film, the reason for the difference is not clear. However, this phenomenon 275 
can be attributed to the method of preparation of the amorphous PET film. In other words, PET 276 
film preparation could be one of the keys to controlling the enzymatic digestibility, which is 277 
important for developing highly degradable PET materials.  278 
 279 
3.4. SEM analysis 280 
 SEM observation in top-view clearly demonstrated that the initially very flat and smooth 281 
surface of the PET film before degradation (Figure 4A and 4B) became undulated after 282 
degradation by Fast-PETase (Figure 4C and 4D), as previously reported [9, 11]. Observations of 283 
the surface from the side confirmed the presence of depressions that were not convex (Figure 4D).  284

degraded part of the PET film observed at a magnification of ×1,000 in top-view (C) and 289

 291 
The films were further observed at different degradation times to track the structural 292 
changes in the amorphous PET film induced by Fast-PETase (Figure 5). Before degradation, the 293 
surface was flat and smooth, whereas after 4 h of degradation, many depressions having a 294 
diameter of 1 μm were apparent. Given that areas of undegraded surface were found close to these 295 
depressions, the depressions were structures generated by Fast-PETase in the initial phase. The 296 
surface of this depression was not as rough as that of the PET degraded for 12 h, as shown below.  297 
At 12 h of degradation, the depressions formed at 4 h were not observed, and the surface 298 
appeared flat at a lower magnification (Figure 5D). However, hollows with a diameter of 2‒4 μm 299 
appeared, and the surface appeared sandy at a higher magnification due to the granularity of many 300 
smaller pores with a diameter of 10‒100 nm (indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 5E and 5F). 301 
This hollow structure was also found less frequently at 4 h of degradation and is thus considered 302 
a characteristic feature that appears after the initial depressions (Figure 5A–5C) disappear.  303 
After 26.5 h, the surface became highly rough even at a lower magnification due to the 304 
larger diameter (10 μm or more) of the holes (Figure 5G). Closer observation revealed many pores 305 
with diameters of 100 nm or less on the surface of the depressions (Figure 5H and 5I), which were 306 
found specifically in the hollows of the sample degraded for 12 h (Figure 5E and 5F). Thus, the 307 
hollows with sizes of a few micrometers frequently observed after 12 h of degradation might have 308 
enlarged or fused to form larger holes.  309 
After 55.2 h, the crater-like depressions, which were also found in some areas after 26.5 310

h, were sufficiently enlarged to expose a relatively flat and smooth surface when viewed at lower 311 
magnification (Figure 5J). However, the higher-magnification images clearly show more porous 312 
surfaces with smaller pore sizes (10‒100 nm) and larger numbers of pores than at 26.5 h (Figure 313 
5K and 5L). These porous features were maintained at 64.5 h, whereas the 1 μm pores became 314 
less; consequently, the surface became flatter with pores of 100 nm or less in diameter (Figure 5N 315 
and 5O). In a wider view (Figure 5M), the crater-like depressions with a diameter of ~50 μm 316 
appeared more clearly. In summary, degradation by Fast-PETase induced hierarchical boring on 317 
the order of 10-5 m to 10-8 in the PET film. 318

undegraded surface, and the arrowheads in E and F show pores with diameters of 10‒325 
100 nm.  326 
 327 
It was thus concluded that the turbidity of the PET film after Fast-PETase degradation 328 
was due to the porous structure generated by Fast-PETase and not to crystallization of the 329 
amorphous parts, as discussed in Section 3.1.  330 
 331 
3.5. SAXS analysis 332 
 Although scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a powerful tool for visualizing the 333 
fine structure of degraded PET, it only provides a local view of the structure. Therefore, it is 334 
necessary to consider whether the SEM observations truly reflect the structure as a whole. SAXS 335 
was used to visualize the mesoscale structure of the degraded PET film in an averaged view. Two 336 
notable observations were made.  337 
Firstly, the scattering intensity around q = 0.022 Å -1, observed before degradation, 338 
decreased quickly (in the first 12 h) after treatment with Fast-PETase (Figure 6A), indicating that 339 
the structure represented by this scattering feature was selectively attacked and removed by Fast-340 
PETase. Furthermore, this signal shifted to lower q, accompanied by a decrease in the intensity 341 
during the early stages of degradation, as shown in the Lorentz-factor-corrected plot (Figure 6A, 342 
inset). Given the equation d = 2π/ q, where d indicates the spatial periodicity, the size of the 343 
structural component represented by this scattering changed from ca. 290 to 320 Å. Although 344 
careful discussion is required for describing the structure represented by this scattering signal, it 345 
may represent a randomly distributed denser region in a less dense region, which has been 346 
proposed as a “nodule” in some previous studies [25, 26].  347 
 The second specific structural change induced by Fast-PETase was observed as an 348

increase in the scattering at the q-region below 0.02 Å-1 in the SAXS profile, up to the reaction 349 
time of 12 h. Given the synchronicity with the appearance of small pores in the SEM images 350 
(diameter of 10‒100 nm), this may represent the small pores observed in the SEM images after 351 
degradation for 12 h and beyond (Figure 5), where the contrast between the PET substrate and air 352 
becomes more pronounced due to the boring. The scattering in this low q-region increased 353 
continuously after 12 h of degradation, and finally the scattering profile at 68.8 h followed a power 354 
law with an exponent of −3.2 in the observed q-range (Figure 6B, black line), which provides the 355 
surface fractal dimension of 2.8 (= 6 – 3.2), indicating that the pores with diameters of 10 -7‒10-8 356 
m formed a three-dimensionally rough surface rather than a smooth surface. This is also consistent 357 
with the SEM observations, which showed that the nested porous structures with dimensions of 358 
10-7 m or smaller became dominant after 12 h degradation.  359

degradation were fitted (closed circles in panel B) and followed a power-law with an 368 
exponent of −3.2 along the scattering vector q, as shown by black line.  369 
 370 
Notably, this study revealed several structural changes that occurred specifically in the 371 
earlier degradation stage: (i) broadening of the amorphous hallow in WAXD profiles (Figure 2B), 372 
(ii) removal of the smooth surface, visualized by SEM (Figures 4 and 5), and (iii) a decrease in 373 
the SAXS signal around q = 0.022 Å-1 (Figure 6A). Summarizing these observations, the surface 374 
layer of the amorphous PET film might be slightly more crystalline than the core region and 375 
contains the domain (nodule) structure with a size of around 300 Å. This surface layer did not 376 
allow PETase to bore smaller holes (~100 nm) and yielded less porous features, as observed in 377 
the SEM images. Thus, this study supports the idea that the surface and core structures differ for 378 
amorphous PET films. Feasibly, PETase can be used as a probe to assess the polymer structure of 379 
PET in future studies.  380 
 381 
3.6. Comparison with enzymatic degradation of cellulose 382 
Finally, the results of this study were compared with the structural changes in cellulose 383 
degraded by cellulase to discuss a biological strategy for degrading solid polymers. In our 384 
previous study [27], the degradation of bacterial cellulose by crude cellulase was analyzed using 385 
SAXS, where an overall decrease in the scattering intensity was observed, without changes in the 386 
scattering features, indicating that the amount of the cellulose simply decreased without 387 
significant structural changes at the scale represented by q = 0.04‒0.2 Å-1. SEM observations in 388 
the same study also demonstrated that the cellulose microfibrils remained generally intact despite 389 
the appearance of large cavities between the fiber bundles in a bacterial cellulose film [27]. 390 
Another study analyzed the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks in the 391 
WAXD profiles, and also showed that the lateral crystallite size of cellulose decreased because of 392

cellulase degradation [28]. These previous observations of cellulose degradation are in contrast 393 
to the structural decay of the PET film by Fast-PETase observed in this study (Figures 2, 5, and 394 
6). This is plausibly due to the structural differences in PET and cellulose due to differences in 395 
the assembly of the polymer molecules, as explained below.  396 
Native cellulosic material is generally a woven textile of crystalline cellulose 397 
microfibrils with a lateral size of 10-9‒10-8 m, whereas the PET film is a continuous mass in which 398 
many chains are entangled without a well-defined elementary structural unit, such as the 399 
microfibrils in cellulose. It is assumed that each cellulose microfibril is degraded independently 400 
by cellulase, and the structural features appear to be maintained on average. However, structural 401 
degradation of the PET film by Fast-PETase may preferentially occur close to the surface, as 402 
revealed by the specific decrease in the SAXS signal at approximately q = 0.022 Å -1 at the 403 
beginning of degradation, which is not observed for cellulose. Therefore, the polymer structure 404 
governs the enzymatic degradability. In other words, the design of the polymer structure is as 405 
important as enzyme engineering for realizing eco-friendly PET or plastic materials in general.  406 
The relationship between the polymer structure and enzymatic degradation of cellulose 407 
has aided in understanding the structure of cellulose and the function of cellulase. For example, 408 
the unidirectional degradation of native cellulose microfibrils by cellobiohydrolase was used to 409 
demonstrate parallel chain packing in native cellulose microfibrils [29]. In contrast, parallel-chain 410 
packing in native cellulose allowed the processive action of cellobiohydrolases to be clearly 411 
understood [30-32]. Such interrelated research is also required for PET and PETase to deepen our 412 
understanding of the mechanism of decay of the PET structure by PETase. Thus, studying PETase 413 
from the viewpoint of the PET structure will be a highly valuable strategy for studying not only 414 
PETase but also PET, where many issues remain obscure despite the long history of research [16-415 
18].  416 
Given that cellulase is a good example of the efficient degradation of polymer solids, it 417

23 
 
will be worthwhile to design a PETase protein by referring to cellulase. The fusion of the 418 
carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) to PETase, which is also found in nature [33], has been 419 
shown to enhance the PET-degrading activity [34-37]. In addition to implementing the absorption 420 
function by CBM, the synergistic effect of mixing enzymes with different modes of action, such 421 
as exotype cellulases (cellobiohydrolases) and endoglucanases, is a promising strategy [23]. To 422 
this end, the mode of action of many PETase proteins must be clarified to design a high-423 
performance PETase cocktail. A cellulase-wise strategy is a promising way to develop higher-424 
performance PETases. This approach is set apart from state-of-the-art technologies, such as 425 
protein engineering with bioinformatics. Polymer structure analysis during enzymatic degradation 426 
is important for the sustainable utilization of plastic materials and for the research and 427 
development of biodegradable plastics.  428 
 429 
4. Conclusion 430 
The multiscale structural analysis in this study revealed that Fast-PETase gradually 431 
eroded the PET film from the surface and bored many pores with diameters of 10-5 to 10-8 m. The 432 
domain structure with dimensions of 10-8 m on the surface of the film was preferentially removed 433 
at earlier reaction times. However, the crystallinity of PET did not change after degradation. In 434 
summary, it was demonstrated that Fast-PETase evenly erodes the amorphous PET film from the 435 
surface. This study provides a perspective on the degradation of the solid PET by PETase. This is 436 
valuable information as a reference for comparing the enzymatic efficacy of PETase variants for 437 
PET degradation that are still to be discovered and will help pave the way for a circular economy 438 
of PET materials in the future by conferring full biodegradability to PET, a conventional plastic.  439
