Abstract   7 
The rising use of plastic results in an appalling amount of waste which scatters into the environment 8 
affecting environmental, animal, and human health. One of these plastics is PET which is mainly used 9 
for bottles and textiles. In this research, we investigate the PET degrading ability of the IsPETase 10 
homolog ScLipA from Streptomyces coelicolor. Of 96 different Streptomyces strains screened, 18 % 11 
were able to degrade the model substrate BHET. Three different variants of lipase A, named ScLipA, 12 
S2LipA and S92LipA were identified and analyzed in detail. The lipA gene was deleted from S. 13 
coelicolor M145 using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in reduced BHET degradation. LipA overexpression in 14 
the knock-out background significantly enhanced BHET degradation. All three enzymes were 15 
expressed in E. coli BL21 for protein purification and biochemical analysis, showing that enzymatic 16 
activity most likely resides in a dimeric form of the enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature were 17 
determined to be pH 7 and 25 °C for all three variants. Using these conditions, the activity on BHET 18 
and amorphous PET film was investigated. S2LipA efficiently degraded BHET and caused roughening 19 
and small indents on the surface of PET films, consistent with PET-degrading activity. The frequent 20 
occurrence of the S2 LipA variant in Streptomyces suggests an environmental advantage towards the 21 
degradation of more hydrophobic substrates such as these polluting plastics in the environment.  22

Introduction  25 
Petroleum-derived plastics are among the most useful and widespread synthetic polymers in the 26 
modern world. They are relatively easy and cheap to produce, extremely versatile and durable 27 
materials, which makes them remarkably attractive for a wide range of applications [1], [2]. This has 28 
caused the demand and production of plastics to rise steadily to an estimated 9.2 billion metric tons 29 
(Mt) produced as of 2023 [1], [3], [4]. Of all plastic produced, 75 % (6.9 billion Mt) has been 30 
mismanaged or landfilled [4]. Durability and resistance to degradation of these polymers, combined 31 
with the increasing output of waste generated by humans, makes plastic accumulation and pollution a 32 
major global environmental concern [5]. In fact, commonly used plastics are generally not 33 
biodegradable, accumulate in landfills or leak into terrestrial and/or aquatic environments, where they 34 
disintegrate into micro- and nano-plastics, thereby posing a serious threat to many ecosystems [5].  35 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is extensively used to produce bottles, food packaging, clothing and 36 
films. The high demand for PET makes it one of the most common plastics that we encounter in 37 
everyday life with 18.8 million tons being produced worldwide in 2015 alone [6]. PET waste 38 
management in most countries today consists mainly of incineration and landfilling. Both practices are 39 
causing detrimental effects to the environment, such as leaching and the release of toxic compounds 40 
[7]. On the other hand, an increasing number of countries have recycling systems in place to prevent 41 
environmental accumulation and make renewed use of the PET waste produced. Despite such efforts, 42 
the recovery ratio is far less than 50 % and only a minor fraction is used to manufacture new products, 43 
with substantial amounts of PET still entering the environment [8].  44 
With plastic waste accumulating in the environment, investigating the adaptation and response of soil 45 
and aquatic microorganisms to plastic exposure has proven eminent. Microbial response and 46 
adaptation mechanisms are likely to help battle plastic pollution and initiate remediation and recycling 47 
options. Enzymatic degradation already has proven to enable natural routes to depolymerize these 48 
recalcitrant polymeric materials. Several PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) have been identified, 49 
initiating biodegradation of this polymer. Predominantly, these are esterases, lipases, cutinases and 50 
cutinase-like enzymes exhibiting hydrolysis of the ester bond between terephthalic acid (TPA) and 51 
ethylene glycol (EG) moieties within the PET polymer [9]–[14]. It was not until 2016 that Yoshida and 52 
colleagues reported the discovery of a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (hereafter I. 53 
sakaiensis), which had evolved towards the degradation and utilization of PET as a sole carbon 54

source [15]. The enzyme identified as responsible for the first step in the catabolism of PET is the 55 
IsPETase (ISF6_4831), classified as an extracellular esterase. This enzyme hydrolyses PET into its 56 
monomer mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with only trace amounts of bis(2-57 
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) being observed. To complete the 58 
breakdown of PET, I. sakaiensis possesses another enzyme, the Is MHETase (ISF6_0224), which is 59 
capable of hydrolyzing MHET into TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), common starting chemicals to 60 
polymerize PET [15]. Compared to other PHEs which have a broader range of substrates, the 61 
IsPETase displays significantly higher activity against BHET, PET films, and commercial bottle-derived 62 
PET at 40 °C [15]. Currently, all PETase-like enzymes are described in the PAZY-database [16]. 63 
Many genera of soil and aquatic bacteria are exposed to accumulated plastics. An important phylum of 64 
bacteria remaining to be investigated is the Actinobacteria. This phylum consists of various complex 65 
genera such as Thermobifida, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and many more. Several enzymes of 66 
actinobacterial origin such as the LCC, TfCut2 and many more have previously been identified and 67 
characterized to exhibit PET degradi ng abilities ear ning their place in the PAZY database [9]–[11], 68 
[13], [16]–[19]. However, for various other genera including Streptomyces only limited information is 69 
available [20]–[25]. Only one Streptomyces enzyme, SM14est has been described [21].  70 
Streptomycetes are filamentous growing soil-dwelling bacteria with a characteristic lifecycle. They are 71 
renowned for their capability to produce antibiotics but are also known to excrete enzymes to degrade 72 
complex natural polymers, including plant biomass [26]–[28]. Depending on the soil pollution rate and 73 
the distance to the polluted area, it is possible to recover 7,5 x 10 4 to 3,0 x 10 4 plastic microparticles 74 
per kilogram (kg) of soil [29]. This equates to 2-20 milligrams (mg) of recoverable plastic particles per 75 
kg of soil [29]. Hence, the rhizosphere and its associated microbes, such as Streptomyces are 76 
extensively exposed to plastics. This exposure to plastics and their ability to degrade complex biomass 77 
with hydrolytic enzymes makes them a promising genus to explore for novel PHEs [20]–[25], [30], [31]. 78 
These possible PHEs are expected to be secreted enzymes. Expression of enzymes in Streptomyces 79 
is a highly regulated process and hence, such regulation will likely play an important role in putative 80 
PET degrading activity [32].  81 
In this research, we identified Lipase A from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScLipA) as a  homolog to the 82 
IsPETase. Consequently, we investigated the ability of S. coelicolor to degrade the PET model 83

compound BHET. Conservation of this BHET degrading ability was investigated by screening a 84 
collection of 96 previously isolated Actinobacteria (predominantly Streptomyces) under various 85 
conditions [33]. This yielded insight into the optimal conditions needed to induce BHET degradation as 86 
well as in the abundance of strains exhibiting BHET-degrading capability. In one or more of the 87 
provided conditions, 44 % of the strains could degrade BHET, 18 % of the evaluated strains were able 88 
to degrade BHET individually confirming a wider distribution of this ability in nature. The presence of 89 
LipA in these strains was explored and the corresponding genes were sequenced. The enzyme is 90 
highly conserved and can be classified into three different variants. The S. coelicolor variant further 91 
named ScLipA, the MBT92 variant (S92LipA) which is only present in MBT92, and a conserved variant 92 
present in all other active strains ( S2LipA). The functionality of all three LipA variants in the 93 
degradation ability of BHET and amorphous PET in Streptomyces species was investigated. A knock-94 
out of the lipA gene was constructed in S. coelicolor M145, and overexpression constructs of the three 95 
variants were expressed in the knock-out to study the effect of the genes in vivo.  The individual 96 
enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli  and purified for the analysis of substrate specificity, 97 
thermostability, and other properties.  Enzyme characteristics were examined using enzyme assays 98 
and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Additionally, the strains, as well as the 99 
purified enzymes, were incubated on amorphous PET films to investigate their true ability to adhere to 100 
and degrade PET.  101 
In conclusion, we present a full comprehensive identification and characterization of a novel, 102 
conserved PET-degrading enzyme family of Streptomyces. Structural characteristics and in vivo and in 103 
vitro activity provide insight into the evolutionary and ecological adaptation of soil bacteria towards 104 
plastics in their environment.  105 
Results 106 
Scavenging the Streptomyces genome for candidate IsPETase homologs. 107 
Homologs of the Is PETase (Accession number A0A0K8P6T7, [34]) encoded by the genomes of 108 
Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces scabies and Streptomyces avermitilis were identified using 109 
protein BLAST. The most promising enzyme was a S. coelicolor enzyme, annotated as a putatively 110 
secreted lipase A (LipA, accession number Q9L2J6, [35]), showed a query coverage of 91 % and an 111 
identity of 48 % with the Is PETase (Fig. 1A) [36]. The 3D structure of the IsPETase (Fig. 1B) and the 112 
AlphaFold model of ScLipA (Fig. 1C) were superimposed, to compare the three-dimensional structures 113

of the enzymes [37]. When overlayed, the overall structures looked very similar (Fig. 1D). The catalytic 114 
triad was conserved, as well as two of the three residues of the previously described substrate binding 115 
site (Fig. 1E and F) [36]. The difference in the binding site is a phenylalanine in LipA instead of a 116 
tyrosine in Is PETase, as shown in figure 1E. The high similarity and the presence of the important 117 
residues for PET degradation hint towards the putative PET degrading activity of the Streptomyces 118 
coelicolor lipase A (ScLipA). On the N-terminal end of the protein, a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) 119 
signal is present indicating that the natural substrate of this enzyme is located outside of the cell [38]. 120 
Indeed, for plastics-degrading enzymes, extracellular activity appears to be essential.  121

BHET degrading activity of S. coelicolor 132 
To further investigate the activity of  S. coelicolor  M145  on BHET, the strain was grown on 133 
Streptomyces minimal medium (StrepMM) agar plates containing BHET. Due to its limited solubility, 134 
the addition of BHET causes the plates to become turbid. When BHET is converted to MHET and/or 135 
TPA, a halo of clearance appears. The secreted enzyme activity was expected to be tightly regulated 136 
in response to environmental growth conditions [32]. Therefore, we tested N-acetyl glucosamine 137 
(GlcNAc) as a possible inducer of secreted enzyme activity. GlcNAc is a monomer of chitin and 138 
peptidoglycan, which under poor nutritional conditions induces development and antibiotic production 139 
in Streptomyces coelicolor [39], [40], whereas in nutrient-rich environments these responses are 140 
blocked [35]. We anticipated that GlcNAc may act as an inducer for the production of extracellular 141 
enzymes such as lipases, esterases and possibly BHET-degrading enzymes. Hence, S. coelicolor 142 
M145 was grown in the presence and absence of BHET [10 mM], mannitol [25 mM] and N-acetyl 143 
glucosamine [25 mM] in all possible combinations.  144 
Interestingly, a clearance halo was observed at 18 days of growth as shown in figure 2A. Notably, 145 
figure 2A displays that the addition of GlcNAc as inducer seemed to induce the degradation of BHET. 146 
Additionally, S. coelicolor produces agarase, which resulted in ‘sinking’ halos which you can see in the 147 
controls without BHET (Fig. 2A, StrepMM) [41]. These ‘sinking halos’ looked very similar to clearance 148 
halos. Therefore, the ability S. coelicolor to degrade BHET in liquid culture was investigated using 149 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  For the liquid analysis, strain M145 was 150 
precultured and inoculated in minimal liquid medium without polyethylene glycol (NMM) with and 151 
without BHET and GlcNAc. Samples were taken after 24 h and 72 h and analyzed using LC-MS. In the 152 
negative ionization mode, the mass of TPA (166 g/mol) could be observed around 4 min retention time 153 
showing a small peak on the UV spectrum, MHET (210 g/mol) appeared around 5.2 min with a strong 154 
signal on both the MS as well as the UV. Finally, BHET (255 g/mol) could be observed in the positive 155 
ionization mode between 5.5 and 6 min with a strong signal at 240 nm (Fig. 2B and 2C). Around 9.5 156 
min, impurity was observed, which was present in the BHET stock (Fig. 2C). When grown in NMM 157 
medium containing BHET, 30-50 % of the BHET was degraded within 24 h, after 72 h, all BHET was 158

degraded and only MHET was present. Indeed, the addition of GlcNAc enhanced the degradation of 159 
BHET (Fig. 2D).  160

Bulk screen and individual screening of Actinobacteria strain collection 172 
With S. coelicolor M145 exhibiting a clear but modest BHET degrading activity on plates, we set out to 173 
screen a diverse collection of 96 Actinobacteria of our strain collection [42] to investigate the spread of 174 
this characteristic and identify additional BHET degrading bacteria. 36 strains were randomly chosen 175 
from this collection to perform an initial BHET toxicity test. Growth of these strains appeared to be 176 
delayed with 10 mM BHET, and impaired with 20 mM BHET and higher concentrations. Hence, a 177 
concentration of 10 mM of BHET was chosen for screening, with all tested strains able to grow and 178 
halos readily observed (Fig. 3A).  179

 180 
A bulk screen for BHET degradation was performed with all 96 strains split over two 96-well plates to 181 
provide them with enough space for development. Seven strains did not grow on the plates and were 182 
taken out of the screen. Spore suspensions were stamped onto plates containing StrepMM with 183 
different agar brands containing combinations of BHET [10 mM], Mannitol [25 mM] and GlcNAc [25 184 
mM]. The type of agar used clearly impacted the observed degradation patterns. The agar brand 185 
seems to have a clear influence on the degradation pattern (Supplement 1). Difco agar was chosen as 186 
the agar source for all further experiments since most strains showed growth on Difco agar. The 187 
addition of GlcNAc resulted in a different halo pattern and more predominant halos during the bulk 188 
screen and induced BHET degradation in most strains (Fig 3B, Supplement 1).  189 
Actinobacteria, especially Streptomyces, depend on environmental cues and interspecies interactions 190 
for the induction of enzymes and secondary metabolites [43]. Consequently, it was important to 191 
investigate their individual BHET degrading activity on separate plates. All strains showing halos in the 192 
bulk BHET screen were grown on individual plates (Supplement 2). Of 38 active strains, only 17 193 
strains exhibited individual activity on BHET after 10 days of growth (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, most 194 
strains required the addition of GlcNAc to express the BHET degrading enzyme. Only 5 strains, MBT5, 195 
12, 15, 91 and 92 degraded BHET in the absence of GlcNAc. MBT92 appeared to exhibit constitutive 196 
expression showing a similar-sized halo in all conditions. To substantiate a good correlation between 197 
halo size and biochemical degradation, strains MBT2, 5, 12, 28, 92 and S. coelicolor M145 were 198 
incubated with approximately 2*10 6 spores on StrepMM Difco plates containing BHET and GlcNAc. 199 
Samples of agar were taken after 15 days using an agar excision tool to cut out part of the halo. Since 200 
S. coelicolor M145 displayed no activity after 15 days (see also above), halos were excised after 18 201 
days. Samples were spun down using nylon spin columns, separating all liquids from the agar, and 202 
prepped for LC-MS analysis (Fig. 3D). In all strains, clear conversion from BHET to MHET was 203 
observed. MBT2, 5, 12, and 28 show traces of TPA suggesting further conversion of MHET.  204

Identification of LipA in BHET-degrading strains  215 
A PCR with degenerative primers was performed to investigate if lipA is present in the strains showing 216 
activity in the individual screens displayed in figure 3C. The PCR results are displayed in supplemental 217 
data S4. The PCR fragments were cloned into a linearized pJET2.1 and sequenced. Sequence 218 
alignment demonstrated substantial divergence within the signal sequence while presenting only minor 219 
variations in the overall enzyme coding region (S5). The enzyme sequences were aligned and could 220 
be clustered into three variants the S. coelicolor variant ( ScLipA), the MBT92 variant (S92LipA) which 221

is only present in MBT92, and a conserved variant present in all other active strains ( S2LipA). (S6). 222 
The enzyme structures predicted with AlphaFold showed minor changes in the enzyme structure with 223 
minor influence on the overall structure (Fig. 4A-H) [37]. The amino acid alignment showed some 224 
variations between the proteins especially surrounding the catalytic triad (Fig. 4I). The signal peptides, 225 
identified with SignalP 5.0, contained several differences [44]. The alignment containing the signal 226

PET films incubated for 2 weeks at 30 °C in NMM with 0.05 % [w/v] glucose with 107 spores and 242 
inoculated for 2 weeks at 30 °C. From left to right: control, strain MBT2, MBT5, MBT12, MBT28 and 243 
MBT92. From top to bottom the magnifications 25 x, 1000 x, 2500 x and 500 0x.  244 
MBT2, 5, 12, 28 and 92 were incubated in NMM with and without GlcNAc. All strains form a biofilm 245 
surrounding the edges of the plastic films, thereby fixing them to the 12 wells plates. After fixation, the 246 
samples were sputter-coated and visualized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All strains 247 
appeared to adhere well to the plastic films, forming hyphal structures colonizing the film (Fig. 5). 248 
Some areas were heavily overgrown and did not allow for visualization of the film. The less cultivated 249 
areas did not show significant damage over the control film suggesting that either more biomass is 250 
needed to observe degradation, or no PET degradation was achieved.  251 
Knock-out and overexpression of the three lipA variants in S. coelicolor 252 
To obtain a better understanding of the role and function of LipA in vivo, a lipA knock-out mutant was 253 
constructed in S. coelicolor M145. The knock-out was validated via diagnostic PCR and sequencing (S 254 
7.1).  255 
Additionally, strains were constructed expressing one of the three different lipA variants under the 256 
control of the pGAP promotor (S 7.2). pGAP is a semi-constitutive promotor that is induced by simple 257 
sugar molecules [45]. To avoid interference of the native ScLipA and other regulatory elements, all 258

over-expression constructs were cloned in strain Δ lipA. This resulted in strain S3 expressing SclipA, 259 
S5 expressing S2lipA and S7 expressing S92lipA. Two expression media were chosen namely NMM 260 
as minimal medium with a defined carbon source and rich medium tryptic soy broth sucrose (TSBS) 261 
which is a protein expression medium. Expression was validated on both media using SDS page and 262 
Western blot (Fig. 6A-B and 6D-E). Both NMM with 5 % (w/v) glucose and TSBS show clear signal on 263

BHET degradation was examined in vivo by inoculating 1,0*108 spores in 50 ml of NMM with glucose 265 
[5 % (v/v)] and BHET or TSBS containing BHET. Samples were taken at 24, 48 and 72 h and analyzed 266 
using LC-MS. The percentages BHET, MHET and TPA were calculated over the total peak area. After 267 
24 h, while the spores are still germinating, limited activity is observed. After 48 h, on NMM, the knock-268 
out shows significantly less activity on BHET than the wildtype strain. After 72 h, there is a clear 269 
difference in the degradation pattern of the knock-out compared to the wildtype strain. The 270 
overexpression constructs show 40-50 % degradation, which is similar to the wildtype strain, although 271 
it is significantly higher than in the knock-out strain (parental strain) (Fig. 6C). Some residual activity, 272 
not related to LipA, was still observed in the knock-out strain.    273 
After 48 h on TSBS, there was no difference observed in the BHET degrading ability of the wildtype 274 
strain compared to the knock-out strain; After 72 h, the wildtype strain degraded significantly more 275 
BHET than the knock-out strain. Unlike minimal medium, the strains containing the overexpressed lipA 276 
variants showed drastic BHET degradation on TSBS after 48 h, with some variation between the 277 
different enzyme variants (Fig. 6F). After 72 h, the knock-out converted approximately 23 % of the 278 
BHET to MHET, whereas the wild-type strain converted approximately 32 %, the overexpression 279 
strains degraded all BHET after 72 h and TPA could be observed in the medium. The knock-out still 280 
showed some activity suggesting the presence of at least one other enzyme with BHET degrading 281 
activity. A two-way ANOVA clearly indicated the statistical significance of the results (S8).  282 
To observe physical changes within the cultures, automated time-lapse microscopy imaging was used 283 
to follow and visualize the development of the strains and degradation of the BHET. This microscope 284 
can make brightfield images at time intervals resulting in a timelapse video (S9). It takes all strains 285 
around 10 h to start developing (Fig. 7). Initially, no or only slight changes were observed in the 286 
presence and shape of the BHET crystals but over time the BHET crystals roughened and 287 
disappeared. The overexpression strains degraded the BHET crystals between 15 and 20 h, where 288

the edges of the crystals started to roughen until the entire crystal fell apart (Fig. 7). The knock-out 289 
strain also degraded crystals, but complete degradation was only observed after 25 h. The wildtype 290 
strain degraded the BHET in approximately 23 h. For time-lapse videos, see supplementary data (S9).    291

Expression and in vitro characterization of Lipase A variants  311 
For extensive in vitro analysis of the enzymes, the corresponding gene sequences were trimmed to 312 
remove their signal peptide, codon-optimized, synthesized, cloned into pET16b (adding an N-terminal 313 
His-tag to the protein) and expressed in E. coli BL21 A-I. As positive controls, the genes encoding for 314 
IsPETase and TfCut2 were synthesized and expressed in the same way. Both Is PETase and TfCut2 315 
have PET degrading activity, however, their substrate preference, efficiency, optimal conditions, and 316 
stability vary. IsPETase has PET as the preferred substrate whereas TfCut2 is a cutinase that also 317 
displays high activity on cutinase-like substrates such as the para-nitrophenyl substrates and lipase-318 
like substrates as tributyrin. Clear bands around 32 kDa indicated the presence of the corresponding 319 
enzymes (Fig. 8A), which was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 8B). His-tag purification resulted in 320 
samples containing three bands for the LipA enzymes (Fig. 8C). The higher band (~60 kDa) could also 321 
be observed in the western blot and most likely corresponded to a dimeric form or aggregate of the 322 
enzyme (Fig. 8C). Native zymogram analysis clearly showed that enzyme activity resided with the ~60 323

The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were determined using paranitrophenyl 345 
dodecanoate as substrate according to the method of Altammar and colleagues [46]. A pH range from 346 
pH 3 to pH 8, was tested for one hour at 30 °C showing pH 7.0 as the optimal pH (Fig. 9A-C). A similar 347

approach was taken to determine the optimal temperature. Enzymes were incubated using a 348 
temperature range of 25 °C-90 °C for 1 h. Thus, the optimal temperature appeared to be 25 °C (Fig. 9 349 
A-C). 350 
These conditions were then used to examine BHET degradation using a colorimetric assay. 2,5 ng/ml 351 
of enzyme was incubated with 1 mM of BHET for 24, 48 and 72 h. The positive controls IsPETase and 352 
TfCut2 show 50-100 % decrease in BHET (Fig. 9D). S2LipA, under these conditions, shows 353 
significantly more BHET degradation than TfCut2 after 24 h. ScLipA shows delayed activity, after 72 h, 354 
BHET degrading activity is observed. The statistical analysis is provided in the supplement (S10). 355 
Simultaneously, amorphous PET films were incubated in pH 7.0 at 25 °C with 15 µg/ml of enzyme for 356 
7 days and visualized using the SEM. IsPETase and TfCut2 were used as positive controls, whereas 357 
buffer without enzyme was used as negative control. The samples only incubated with buffer show a 358 
smooth clean surface. PET films incubated with the IsPETase show clear damage in the form of dents 359 
and cavities (Fig. 10). The Tf Cut2 showed roughening of the surface and at 10.000 x magnification 360 
small indents. S2LipA showed a similar pattern as TfCut2 only here it appeared that the top layer of 361 
the plastic was not completely degraded (2500 x-10.000 x), in places where this layer is degraded 362 
similar damage is observed as shown in TfCut2. Both S92LipA and ScLipA show very limited to no 363 
activity (Fig. 10).  364

Discussion  380 
Plastics are very useful materials, simplifying everyday life. Unfortunately, poor waste management of 381 
plastics leads to polluting leakage into the environment. Understanding and harnessing nature’s 382 
response to this abundant plastics pollution may help find new solutions for sustainable plastics 383 
depolymerization and recycling. However, and importantly, the abundance of micro-organisms that 384 
have adapted to utilization and degradation of plastics is not known, and evolution and conservation of 385 
genes and proteins involved remains largely unexplored.  386 
In this research, we have investigated plastics degrading activity of an IsPETase homolog Lipase A 387 
(LipA) from Streptomyces coelicolor. Of 96 Streptomyces strains 44 % was able to degrade BHET in at 388 
least one of the tested conditions, 18 % of the strains showed degrading activity when tested 389 
individually. Clearly, regulation of the induction of BHET-degrading activity by GlcNAc presented an 390 
important factor, however, the exact mechanism is still unknown. When strains MBT2, 5, 12, 38 and 92 391

were grown on amorphous PET films, they clearly showed adherence to the plastic while no 392 
immediate damage was observed. 393 
We have shown the presence of lipA in 15 different Streptomyces strains as a highly conserved gene 394 
with some variations. The three variants ScLipA (present in S. coelicolor), S92LipA (present in MBT92 395 
and S2LipA (present all other active strains) were further investigated. The in vivo activity of Sc LipA 396 
was investigated by comparing a knock-out strain with the wildtype strain, in both rich and minimal 397 
medium; the knock-out exhibited a significant decrease in its BHET degrading activity. Since some 398 
remaining BHET degradation was still observed in the knock-out strain, at least one other enzyme is 399 
likely to be involved in BHET degradation. However, this activity most likely resides with another type 400 
of enzyme since no other IsPETase homolog was found during the homology search. All three LipA 401 
variants, when expressed in the knock-out background under a semi-constitutive promoter, exhibited 402 
significantly enhanced degradation of BHET compared to the wildtype, on both rich and minimal 403 
medium. The variant enzymes were expressed in E. coli , purified and subjected to enzyme assays. 404 
Interestingly, after purification, two clear bands are visible at ~30 kDa and ~60 kDa. Native enzyme 405 
analysis via a zymogram indicated that activity only resided with the higher band, suggesting that the 406 
active form was a dimer. Indeed, 3D-structure prediction with AlphaFold-multimer suggested the 407 
formation of a dimeric enzyme with a probability of 90 % (S11) [47].  408 
All enzyme variants were found to have an optimal pH of 7 and optimal temperature of 25 °C. 409 
Colorimetric BHET assays confirmed BHET degrading activity of S2LipA and Sc LipA under optimal 410 
conditions. Additionally, incubation of amorphous PET film with purified S2LipA caused the formation 411 
of indents and roughening of the surface, similar to the activity of PET-degrading cutinase TfCut2, 412 
further confirming PETase-like activity.  413 
Our data suggests that PET is not the main substrate for these enzymes and that PET degradation 414 
merely appears as a moonlighting effect of the lipase activity, similar to the moonlighting effect 415 
described for TfCut2. S92LipA and ScLipA showed less activity than S2LipA which most probably is 416 
due to structural variations in the enzymes caused by the various amino acid substitutions. For 417 
example, S2LipA contains a region rich in serines close to important substrate binding residues and 418 
the substrate binding cleft (Fig. 4I) as opposed to S92LipA and ScLipA. This may result in enhanced 419 
formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate and/or enhanced enzyme stability [48]–[50]. 420

Additionally, serines have previously been found to make an enzyme more hydrophobic in neutral and 421 
alkaline conditions which is preferable for PET binding [51], [52].  Since all of the strains in our study 422 
are environmental isolates, we hypothesize that the abundance of S2LipA in these strains is initially 423 
caused by evolution towards a more stable and hydrophobic lipase and not toward plastic degradation 424 
per se. Yet, current pollution rates may push environmental evolution of those enzymes towards 425 
enhanced PET affinity. The current abundance of PET-degrading enzymes in nature indicates that 426 
nature can indeed take on the challenge of degradation and bioremediation. By further investigating 427 
and understanding this phenomenon, the microbial and enzyme characteristics involved, and applying 428 
those features, we may ultimately move towards less pollution and a more sustainable future.  429

Materials and methods 431 
Strains and culturing conditions  432 
For the initial tests, Streptomyces coelicolor M145 [28] and Actinobacteria from the MBT strain 433 
collection of the Institute of Biology Leiden were used for screening. These strains were isolated from 434 
the Himalaya mountains, Qinling mountains, Cheverny and Grenouillere France and the Netherlands 435 
[42]. The Streptomyces plates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 days or longer before investigating the 436 
BHET degradation. E. coli was grown on Luria-Burtani (LB) agar or in LB cultures overnight at 37 °C.  437 
Routine Streptomyces manipulation, growth and preparation of spore stocks was performed according 438 
to the Streptomyces manual  [53]. Spore suspensions were obtained by growing the strains on Soy 439 
Flour Mannitol agar (SFM [54]) until sporulation.  440 
 441 
Homology search 442 
Potential homologs of the PETase Ideonella sakaiensis (Uniprot A0A0K8P6T7 (PETH_IDESA)) in the 443 
Actinobacterial genomes were identified by performing a BLASTp for the genome of Streptomyces 444 
coelicolor (NCBI 100226) [35].  BLASTp was run in the default setting. The hits were ranked based on 445 
their BLAST score, their query cover, their percent identity and the presence of the catalytic triad and 446 
substrate binding site. 447 
 448 
Bulk screens 449 
The strains are inoculated on the plates using the stamping method. A stamp fitting a 96-wells plate 450 
was autoclaved, placed in the stamping device and placed in the 96 wells plate, containing 100 μ l of 451 
each spore stock in separate wells, and stamped on the plates of interest. Each spot contained 452 
approximately 2 μl of spore solution. The plates were grown for 10 days at 30 °C. the spore plates 453 
were stored at -20 °C.  454 
 455 
Plate assays 456 
Plate assays were performed using minimal medium plates with different types of agars. Upon media 457 
selection, Streptomyces minimal medium (StrepMM [53]) Difco agar was chosen as standard condition 458 
[55]. Plates and additives are described in table 1. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) provided 459

CRISPR/Cas knock-out 485 
To obtain a LipA knock-out strain, the CRISPR-Cas9-based pCRISPomyces was used [56], [57]. In 486 
this system, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated double stranded break will be repaired via homology-directed 487 
repair. Two homologous arms of approximately 1000 bp with a 40 nt overlap at both sides of lipA have 488 
been amplified via PCR on genomic DNA of M145. These homologous arms can be digested into the 489 
pCRISPomyces-2 via three-piece Gibson Assembly using the XbaI site. Additionally, a sgRNA will be 490 
annealed into the plasmid using Golden Gate cloning. Primers for these homologous arms bordering 491 
LipA and sgRNA were made using the protocol of Cobb and colleagues. Assembled plasmids were 492 
confirmed via sequencing. Assembled plasmids were transferred to Streptomyces coelicolor M145 via 493 
conjugation with E. coli ET12567 harboring the pUZ8002 plasmid [58], [59]. Single colonies were 494 
streaked on SFM with apramycin [50 μ g/ml] to check for true apramycin resistance. Resistant colonies 495 
were picked to TSBS for gDNA isolation. Correct gene knock-outs were confirmed via diagnostic PCR 496 
and sequencing. Plasmid loss was achieved by restreaking strains for several generations on SFM 497 
agar without antibiotic pressure at 37 °C and checking for the loss of apramycin resistance [50], [51].  498

was isolated and the lipA PCR amplified with overhangs containing a NdeI site on the 5’ and a His-tag 504 
followed by a BamHI site on the 3’ end of the product. pSET152 was linearized with BamHI and NdeI 505 
and PCR amplified lipA genes were digested into the plasmid using T4 ligase. Assembled plasmids 506 
were confirmed via sequencing. ScLipA and its variations were cloned into pSET152 under the 507 
regulation of strong semi-constitutive promotor pGAP [45]. pSET152 was transferred to Streptomyces 508 
coelicolor M145 via conjugation as described in [58], [59]. Single colonies were streaked on SFM with 509 
apramycin to select for correct integration of the plasmid. All strains obtained are described in table 4.  510

Liquid cultures for enzyme expression. 518 
For liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, 1,0 x 108 spores were inoculated in 519 
50 ml liquid minimal medium without PEG (NMM [53]) + 5 % glucose (w/v) and Tryptic soy broth 520 
sucrose (TSBS [53]) containing 10 mM BHET. Samples of 1 ml were taken after 24, 48 and 72 h. 521 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 522 
Upon thawing, cell-free media was prepared for the LC-MS run by dilution in 1:1 in acetonitrile at a 523 
final volume of 1 ml and passed through 0.2 μ m filters (Sartorius). Analysis of TPA, MHET, and BHET. 524 
LC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20AD system with a Shimadzu Shim-Pack GIST-525

and 260 nm. The following solvent system, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, was used: solvent A, 0.1 % 527 
formic acid in water; solvent B, acetonitrile. Gradient elution was as follows: 80:20 (A/B) for 1 min, 528 
80:20 to 45:55 (A/B) over 6 min, 45:55 to 0:100 (A/B) over 1 min, 0:100 (A/B) for 2 min, then reversion 529 
back to 80:20 (A/B) over 1 min and 80:20 (A/B) for 2 min. This system was connected to a Shimadzu 530 
8040 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI ionisation). 531 
 532 
The reference chromatogram used for the identification of BHET and its monomers [~1 mg/ml each]. 533 
The area percentage was calculated using GraphPad Prism. The statistical analysis consists of a two-534 
way ANOVA using the default setting of GraphPad Prism (p=0,05). A multiple comparison was 535 
performed providing insights into the significance of each compound present in each culture. The 536 
outcomes of the statistical analysis are provided in Supplement S8. 537 
Microscopy 538 
The Lionheart FX automated microscope (BioTek) was used for the time-lapse imaging of BHET 539 
particle degradation. In total, 3.5*10 4 spores were precultured in TSBS + nalidixic acid [50 µg/ml] for 540 
48 h. Spores were precultured in TSBS containing nalidixic acid [50 µg/ml] for 48 h. Of this solution, 5 541 
µl was inoculated in 200 µl TSBS containing ampicillin [50 µg/ml] and BHET [0.25 mM]. This solution 542 
was added to a Greiner Bio-One SensoPlate 96-well, non-treated black plate with a clear bottom and 543 
spun down to settle the mixture. Bright-field pictures were taken every 15 min over the course of 60 h 544 
on a 40 x magnification at 30 °C. 545 
Expression in E. coli  546 
The used S2LipA, S92LipA and ScLipA were codon optimized for E. coli and ordered with GeneART 547 
from ThermoFisher Scientific (Netherlands). The genes arrived in the Thermofisher plasmid pMA 548 
containing an ampicillin resistance. 549 
The plasmids were transformed to chemical competent  E. coli  DH5α  cells for amplification and 550 
isolated using the “GeneJET plasmid miniprep Kit" (Thermofischer, K0503). After plasmid isolation, the 551 
lipA variants were cloned into the pET16b plasmid using restriction/ligation with restriction enzymes 552 
BamHI and NdeI [10 U/ μ l] (Thermofischer Scientific). BamHI was added half an hour after incubation 553 
with NdeI to achieve higher efficiency. Following restriction, the restriction enzymes were inactivated 554 
by incubating the samples for 20 min at 80 °C in a water bath. The lipA  genes and the linearized 555

Transformed E. coli BL21 A-I ( Invitrogen C607003) strains were grown on agar plates with ampicillin 563 
[100 μ g/mL] at 37 °C or in LB liquid medium at 37 °C on 200 rpm. 564 
Enzyme purification  565 
For protein production, 20 ml precultures with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) of the transformed E. coli BL21 A-I 566 
were made following the standard culture conditions. 5 ml of these precultures was transferred to 500 567 
ml TB containing ampicillin. When an OD value between 0.6-0.8 was reached, the cultures were 568 
induced using of arabinose [0.2 % (w/v)] and IPTG [0.5 mM]. The induced cultures were incubated 569 
overnight along with a 1 ml non-induced sample at 16 °C with 200 rpm shaking.  570 
The pellet was harvested from 1 ml of the induced and non-induced samples, by spinning down for 5 571 
min at 13000 rpm and removing the supernatant. Subsequently, this pellet was resuspended in the 572 
300 μ l of MilliQ water. The samples were sonicated (Bandelin, Sonopuls) for 2x 30 sec at 15 % 573

Amplitude with the MS73 probe to release to proteins. From the cell lysate, 3 μ l was loaded on SDS- 574 
PAGE to evaluate if the induction was successful. 575 
Pellet the 500 ml cultures were harvested by ultracentrifugation (Himac) for 30 min, 6000 rpm at 4 °C. 576 
The harvested pellet was transferred to 50 ml falcon tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen 577 
pellets were stored at -20 °C.  578 
Next, defrosted pellet was resuspended in 15 ml Buffer A (table 8). These solutions were sonicated 579 
(Bandelin, Sonopuls) 3 times for 30 sec at 15 % Amplitude. Subsequently, to remove the insoluble 580 
faction’s ultracentrifugation (Himac) took place for 60 min, 10.000 rpm at 4 °C. The Sample was 581 
filtered through a 0.2 µm filter (Filtropur S 0.2 µm, Sarstedt). 582 
To obtain purified Lipase A variants, His – affinity purification on an AKTA system was performed, 583 
following the AKTA start manual. In the purification process, two additional buffers were employed 584 
(Tabel 8).  585 
Table 8: Buffers for the His – affinity purification 586 
Buffer Type of Buffer Composition 
Buffer A Equilibration buffer 25mM Tris-HCl and 300 mM NaCl pH 7.5 
Buffer B Elution Buffer 25mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole pH 7.5 
Buffer C Desalting Buffer 25 mM Tris-HCl and150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 
During the purification, buffer B was used to first wash the non-binding proteins (15 % buffer B) and 587 
then to elute the Lipase A variants from the column (100 % buffer B). After purification, the fractions 588 
were desalted using buffer C desalting columns (Cytiva, PD-10) according to the protocol of Cytiva 589 
columns. The resulting purified Lipase A variants were stored at -20 °C in a 1:1 mixture of Buffer with 590 
40 % glycerol. 591 
SDS-PAGE, Western blot and Zymogram 592 
For SDS and Western-Blot, 50 ml of TSBS / NMM + 5 % glucose (v/v) were inoculated with 50 µl 593 
dense spore prep and incubated for 24 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and 594 
supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μ m filter. The supernatant was concentrated using a Viaspin 595 
column (Sartorius 5 kDas). Protein concentrations were estimated and normalized to 200 ng/ μl by 596 
performing a Bradford assay. 597

Overall, all SDS pages contained 12 % acrylamide and were run for 20 min at 70 V to stack the 598 
proteins on the gels. Further, the gel was run at 150 V until the loading dye reached the bottom of the 599 
gel. SDS-page gels were stained with Coomassie-blue staining. For western blot, the gels were 600 
transferred using a BioRad Trans-blot Turbo and the corresponding transfer packs (1704157EDU) 601 
according to the mixed gel protocol of BioRad. Gel was washed using Tris buffered saline (TBS) buffer 602 
and blocked using Tris buffered saline with 0.5 % Tween 20 (TBST) buffer containing 1 % Elk milk. 603 
The blot was blocked between 60-90 min. His-antibody was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml 604 
and incubated overnight (K953-01). The blot was rinsed with water and washed 4 times with TBST, the 605 
blot is then incubated with luminol for 1 min, (product number) dried, and developed on X-ray film.  606 
For the zymogram, an 8 % native gel, was run for 30 min at 70 V and 2 h at 150 V. The gel was rinsed 607 
with demi water and washed with demi water and equilibrated by incubating 3 times for 30 min with 25 608 
mM NaCl. After, the gel is placed on a 1 % tributyrin, 0.5 % agarose plate and incubated at 30 °C for 609 
1.5 h [61]. 610 
Enzyme assays  611 
Standard enzyme assays 612 
The concentration of enzyme was estimated using the Bradford method (ref and company). The 613 
esterase/cutinase activity was tested using para-nitrophenyl dodecanoate (sigma) The protocol 614 
followed was based on the protocol of Altammar and colleagues with minor adjustments [46]. For the 615 
optimal pH test, 50 mM citrate buffers ranging from pH 3 to pH 7 were used, for pH 7.5 and 8 50 mM 616 
Tris-HCl buffer was used. The incubation step of 10 min was prolonged to 1 h. The reaction was 617 
terminated using 0.1 M sodium carbonate [46] 618 
Colorimetric assay BHET degradation 619 
The colorimetric assay was performed according to the methods of Beech and colleagues [62]. 0.5 ng 620 
of enzyme was incubated with 1mM of BHET for 24, 48 and 72 h and measured at 615 nm in the 621 
Tecan M Spark. A reference line was made by adding BHET in the concentrations of 1 mM to 0 mM in 622 
steps of 0.1 mM an excess of TfCut2 was added to convert all BHET to MHET.  623 
The amount of BHET degraded was calculated with GraphPad using the above-mentioned reference. 624 
The statistical analysis consists of a one-way ANOVA using the default setting of GraphPad Prism (p = 625 
0.05). A comparison was made between the means of each enzyme treatment providing insights into 626

the significance of the BHET degrading activity of each enzyme. The outcomes of the statistical 627 
analysis are provided in Supplemental data S10. 628 
SEM  629 
The effect of Streptomyces on amorphous plastic films was investigated by incubating 107 spores in 3 630 
ml of NMM with amorphous PET for two weeks at 30 °C. The samples were fixed with 1.5 % 631 
glutaraldehyde (30 min). Subsequently, samples were dehydrated using series of increasing ethanol 632 
percentages (70 %, 80 %, 90 %, 96 % and 100 %, each step 30 minutes) and critical point dried 633 
(Baltec CPD-030). Hereafter the samples were coated with 10 nm Platinum palladium using a sputter 634 
coater, and directly imaged using a JEOL JSM6700F. When investigating enzymes on PET film, 15 635 
µg/ml of enzyme was incubated for 7 days, the films were washed with water and 70 % ethanol, air 636 
dried, sputter coated with 10 nm Platinum palladium and visualized using a JEOL JSM6700F. 637
