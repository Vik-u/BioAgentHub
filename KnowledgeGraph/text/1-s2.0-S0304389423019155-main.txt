ABSTRACT  
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most used plastics which has caused some environmental pollution 
and social problems. Although many newly discovered or modified PET hydrolases have been reported at pre -
sent, there is still a lack of comparison between their hydrolytic capacities, as well as the need for new 
biotechnology to apply them for the PET treatment. Here, we systematically studied the surface-display tech -
nology for PET hydrolysis using several PET hydrolases. It is found that anchoring protein types had little in -
fluence on the surface-display result under T7 promoter, while the PET hydrolase types were more important. By 
contrast, the newly reported FAST-PETase showed the strongest hydrolysis effect, achieving 71.3% PET hy -
drolysis in 24 h by pGSA-FAST-PETase. Via model calculation, FAST-PETase indeed exhibited higher temperature 
tolerance and catalytic capacity. Besides, smaller particle size and lower crystallinity favored the hydrolysis of 
PET pellets. Through protein structure comparison, we summarized the common characteristics of efficient PET- 
hydrolyzing enzymes and proposed three main crystal structures of PET enzymes via crystal structural analysis, 
with IS PETase being the representative and main structure. Surface co-display of FAST-PETase and MHETase can 
promote the hydrolysis of PET, and the C-terminal of the fusion protein is crucial for PET hydrolysis. The results 
of our research can be helpful for PET contamination removal as well as other areas involving the application of 
enzymes.

Synopsis: This research can promote the development of better PET hydrolase and its applications in PET 
pollution treatment via bacteria surface-display.   
1. Introduction 
Owing to the robustness, impermeability to gases and high trans -
parency, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has emerged as a prevailing 
material in the packaging and textile industry [1] . According to statistics, 
its global annual production capacity reached 30.5 million tons in 2019 
and is expected to increase to 35.3 million tons by 2024 [2] . Currently, 
plastic fragments and particles, including microplastics and nano -
plastics, have been found in marine environments and various species, 
highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive actions to resolve this 
prevalent issue [3,4] . Over the last decade, many enzymes originating 
from microbes have been identified as capable of cleaving the ester bond 
linkages in PET, including esterases, PETase (EC 3.1.1.101), carbox -
ylesterases, and cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) [5] . Among them, the most 
renowned one is Ideonella Sakaiensis 201-F6, first reported in 2016 for its 
exceptional ability to efficiently depolymerize PET films [6] . By con -
ducting a detailed analysis of both protein and gene sequences, the au -
thors identified two key enzymes, namely Is PETase and MHETase, which 
formed the core of efficient PET depolymerization process. With the 
discovery of IS PETase, a large number of natural PET hydrolase were 
discovered successively from isolated bacteria and shotgun metagenome 
sequence assembling [7] . However, considering the thermal instability 
of natural IS PETase enzymes and high glass transition temperature of 
PET, some PETase mutants were published with enhanced hydrolysis 
activity and stability compared to the wild type [8,9] . Despite the 
promising results in the discovery of PET hydrolases, their practical 
engineering applications have not been thoroughly evaluated or 
compared. 
Cell surface-display is an innovative technique that can anchor a 
target protein to the outer membrane of a cell, which facilitates the 
preservation of enzyme function and activity, and enhances the stability 
and reusability of enzyme in the cell surface [10] . Compared with 
intracellular expression and secretion, cell surface-display technology 
has unique advantages: 1) Enzyme displayed on the cell outer membrane 
can maintain function under harsh conditions. 2) Enzyme displayed can 
play the role directly, avoiding the complex process of lysing cells or 
protein purification. 3) Co-display of multi-enzyme enzymes can 
improve catalytic efficiency. 4) Surface-displayed functional enzymes 
can act on large molecular mass substrates [11] . Although some attempts 
on PET hydrolase surface-display have been reported with a certain 
results [12 – 14] , there is still a lack of researches on the selection of 
anchoring proteins, the comparison of different PET hydrolases, and a 
series of issues arising from them, especially the hidden mechanisms 
involved. 
In this work, we conducted a systematic study on how to construct 
surface-displayed engineered bacteria for the hydrolytic treatment of 
PET plastics. In order to study the effect of anchoring protein types on 
the surface-display system, three different anchoring proteins were 
selected for the construction, including inaXN, estA, pGSA. At the same 
time, four PET hydrolases were chosen for the degradation of PET 
plastics, including three newly reported enzymes and the most well- 
known IS PETase. Among the surface-display systems built, pGSA- 
FAST-PETase exhibited the highest PET hydrolytic performance at 
50 
◦
C. In addition, we investigated the effect of ion addition, particle size 
and crystallinity of PET particle on PET degradation via pGSA-FAST- 
PETase engineered bacteria. In order to investigate the intrinsic rea -
sons of hydrolysis differences, crystal structure analysis and molecular 
dynamics simulation were introduced for the study. Notably, the co- 
display of MHETase and FAST-PETase exhibited enhanced PET hydro -
lysis result, and the hydrolysis capacity and products varied as the 
change of the enzyme in fusion protein C-terminal end. Our results not 
only deepen the understanding of PET hydrolases, but also can provide 
some theoretical guidance in facing other enzymes for surface-display 
applications. Importantly, the application of comparative protein 
structure analyses and molecular dynamics simulations can facilitate the 
systematic investigation and comparison of PET hydrolases. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Materials and methods 
2.1.1. Culture conditions and plasmid construction 
The gene sequences utilized in this investigation are specified in the 
Supporting Information (SI) Table 1 . The PET-30a vector backbone was 
employed for plasmid construction in this study, and E. coli DH5 α was 
used for cultivated in LB medium (1% w/v tryptone, 0.5% w/v yeast 
extract, and 1% w/v NaCl) with 50 μ g/mL kanamycin at 37 
◦
C. PET-30 
vector backbone is a commonly used vector, possessing the T7 promoter, 
which can accomplish a large amount of the target protein expression in 
a short period of time. And this vector possesses more enzyme cleavage 
sites, which can facilitate the recombination of anchored proteins and 
multiple enzymes. The anchor proteins sequences were downloaded 
from NCBI, including pGSA [15] (poly- γ -glutamate synthetase A protein, 
ACT52837.1), inaXN [16] (ice nucleation protein N-domain, 
ACN91081.1), and estA [17] (outer membrane esterase autotransporter, 
CP034908). All expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) 
through heat shock (37 ℃ ), and the detailed procedural steps can be 
found in a prior study [12] . To induce the surface-display protein 
expression, 0.1 mM isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was 
added to the culture (OD
600 
= 0.7) under shaking conditions at 20 
◦
C for 
16 h. And all the plasmid maps were supplied in Supplementary Infor -
mation and the sequences used were shown in SI Table S1 . To remove 
interference from the culture medium, all bacteria were used by 
centrifugation, washed three times by PBS, and resuspended in PBS 
(OD
600 
= 1). 
2.2. Enzyme activity assay and weight loss for PET 
A total of 80 μ L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, 10 μ L p- 
nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB, 8 mM) [14] , and 10 μ L bacterial solution 
(OD
600 
= 1) were successively added into a 2 mL centrifuge tube to react 
for 5 min. After the reaction was completed, 100 μ L ethanol was added 
to halt the reaction, and subsequently cooled to room temperature on 
ice. The reaction product was then transferred into a 96-well plate for 
quantification and the formation of p-nitrophenol was recorded at a 
wavelength of 405 nm. As a negative control, BL21(DE3) cells without 
any surface-display expression vectors were utilized. 
PET film (0.1 mm thick) and PET powder with different particles (50, 
200, 500, 1000, 2000 mesh) are purchased from the market (roll or 
granular material). 4 g PET powder or 3 pieces 1 cm × 1 cm films were 
placed in a 250 mL conical flask. Next, 100 mL bacterial solution (OD
600 
= 1) was added, and the flask was sealed with a membrane. The mixture 
was positioned on a constant temperature shaker at 180 rpm for 24 h 
before being terminated on ice. Then, the PET materials were filtered, 
and rinsed with ultrapure water, 0.1% SDS and ethanol, successively. 
After dried thoroughly at room temperature for 48 h, the weight of PET 
particles was measured and recorded.

2.3. Double-chambered experiment 
This experiment involved separating the whole-cell catalytic bacteria 
and PET plastics using a semi-permeable membrane. 250 mL bacterial 
solution was loaded into the left chamber of the reactor. A certain 
amount of PET plastic films and particles was measured and placed in 
the right chamber with same amount of PBS. The assembled instrument 
was placed on a water bath shaker at 50 
◦
C for 24 h. The experimental 
setup of the double-chambered experiment is depicted in the SI Fig. S9 . 
2.4. Enzyme-linked immunomagnetic bead precipitation 
20 μ L Anti-His magnetic beads were gently mixed by pipetting and 
added to a clean centrifuge tube with 480 μ L 1X TBS to reach a final 
volume of approximately 0.5 mL. Then the Anti-His magnetic beads 
mixture was mixed with bacterial solution and placed on a magnetic 
rack for 10 s to separate. Finally, the OD
600 
of the supernatant was 
measured. 
2.5. Bacterial outer membrane protein extraction 
The Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotec, China) was 
used to extract the outer membrane proteins from E. coli BL21. The 
detailed process can be referred to the manual. 
2.6. Effect of temperature, pH, metal ions on hydrolase activity of PET 
The enzymatic activity at different temperatures was measured using 
pNPB as the substrate, with the maximum enzymatic activity defined as 
100%. For the effect of metal ions, the enzymatic activity was measured 
after incubation at 50

with a final concentration of 10 mM in the 
system. And pH experiment was performed by the same method. 
2.7. Hydrolysis ability of PET powders with different particle sizes 
250 mL induced bacterial liquid (OD
600 
= 1) was taken and adjusted 
to pH = 8.5. Different sizes of PET powder (50, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 
mesh) were separately weighed and added, then hydrolyzed at 50 ℃ for 
24 h. This process was repeated three times and calculate the final 
weight loss rate. 
2.8. Hydrolysis ability of PET powders with different PET bottle 
crystallinity 
The PET plastic bottle with the “ 01 ″ symbol at the bottom was 
divided into three parts, including the bottle cap, body, and bottom. 
Each part was ground using a grinder and collected through a 200-mesh 
sieve. The collected powders were added separately to the bacterial

solution and hydrolyzed at 50 ℃ for 24 h, and weight loss rates were 
calculated at last. 
2.9. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking 
Gromacs 2020 is used for the all-atom MD simulations using 
CHARMM36 force field and SPC/E water model, and the detailed 
pipeline can refer to the default workflow of “ Free Energy of Solva -
tion ” [18] . Energy minimization was conducted utilizing the steepest 
descent algorithm. To ensure system stability, system equilibration was 
carried out in two distinct phases (NVT and NPT). Significantly, the 
temperature parameter in NVT and NPT ensembles should be modified 
(300 K and 330 K). Molecular docking was performed using Discovery 
studio 2019, as well as protein sequence alignment. 
2.10. Protein crystal structure alignment and data analysis 
Structure comparison and alignment were performed by US-align 
[19] and Discovery studio 2019, and visualized by PyMOL. The varia -
tion analysis was performed using R rstatix packages. 
2.11. Material characterization experiment by SEM, FITR, XPS 
The specific operation process of scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopies FITR and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be referred to this paper [20] . 
2.12. HPLC analysis of the degradation product of PET 
A Waters E2695 chromatographic system, equipped with a HyPUR -
ITY C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm), was employed in this study for HPLC 
analysis. The mobile phase was comprised of a mixture of methanol and 
18 mM phosphate buffer, flowing at a rate of 0.5 mL/min, with detection 
at a wavelength of 240 nm. Elution conditions involved the use of 25% 
(v/v) methanol for the 0 – 30 min segment, followed by a 25 – 100% linear 
gradient of methanol from 30 to 50 min. The total peak areas of MHET, 
terephthalic acid (TPA), and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) 
were utilized in determining the quantity of product from each PET 
hydrolysis reaction. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. PET hydrolytic enzymes play a more important role than anchoring 
proteins 
Outer membrane proteins, lipoproteins, fimbria proteins, and 
flagellar proteins have been widely utilized as effective anchoring pro -
teins in bacterial surface-display construction [21] . However, to our 
knowledge, few previous studies investigated how the choice of anchor 
protein affect the activity of the PET hydrolase [22] . Theoretically, the 
size and structure of target proteins displayed by different anchoring 
proteins should vary greatly. Therefore, we selected three commonly 
used but structurally diverse anchor proteins, including pGSA (a kind of 
Gram-positive bacteria outer membrane protein), inaXN (ice nucleation 
protein), and estA (outer membrane esterase autotransporter, type 5 
secretion systems), and the differences between them can be found in 
the paper published [23] . We fused IS PETase with above three anchoring 
proteins to study the effect of anchoring protein on surface-display 
performance. It is worth noting that two G4S flexible peptides 
(GGGGSGGGGS) [24] ( Fig. 1 A) were used to connect the anchoring 
proteins and target affinity proteins during the construction process, 
because the absence of flexible peptides could affect the display effect, 
such as estA. Via the MD simulation, the G4S flexible peptides showed 
high flexibility, and no binding or entanglement occurred between the 
anchoring protein and PETase. ( Fig. 1 D). 
PETase can hydrolyze pNPB to p-nitrophenol and butyric acid, which 
p-nitrophenol has a strong absorption peak at 405 nm [25] . Under in -
cubation temperatures of 37 ℃ , 50 ℃ , and 72 ℃ , the enzyme activity 
levels of pGSA-PETase were 3.54%, 3.8%, and 10.8% higher than 
inaXN-PETase, respectively ( Fig. 1 B). Similarly, compared to 
estA-PETase, pGSA-PETase was found little higher under the same in -
cubation temperatures. We surmised that this advantage of 
pGSA-PETase may be due to the following reasons: 1. smaller interfer -
ence between the anchor and passenger proteins; 2. codon advantage; 3. 
shorter length of the fusion protein. 
Like the enzyme activity, it was observed that pGSA-PETase exhibi -
ted higher PET hydrolysis rates (72 h, 200 mesh) in comparison to 
inaXN-PETase and estA-pGSA at all tested temperatures. Specifically, 
the hydrolysis rates of pGSA-PETase were 3.5%, 7.6%, 6.6% and 7.1%, 
6.2%, 9.9% higher than inaXN-PETase and estA-pGSA at 37 ℃ , 50 ℃ , 
and 72 ℃ , respectively ( Fig. 1 C). However, even with the selection of 
significantly different anchoring proteins, the variations in hydrolytic 
capacity among them did not exceed 10%. The strong expression of the 
target protein driven by the T7 promoter under IPTG induction [26] may 
potentially mask the differences in the surface-display ability of the 
target protein to some extent. So, the anchor protein type is not the main 
consideration on PET hydrolysis by bacterial surface-display. Although 
the overall improvement is not significant, using pGSA as an anchored 
protein for PET hydrolyzing in this study was a better choice based on 
above result. At 50 ℃ and 72 ℃ , the bacteria are unable to survive, but 
it does not affect the activity of the enzyme [27] . This is also one of the 
advantages of surface-displayed engineered bacteria, as there is no need 
for cell lysis to release the enzyme. Here, the bacterial cells serve as the 
biological carriers of the enzyme, and the advantage lies in the rapid 
proliferation of bacteria. Compared to non-biological materials, it 
eliminates the need for material synthesis and immobilization processes. 
With pGSA as the priority anchoring protein, we systematically 
investigated four PET hydrolases, including IS PETase, a newly discov -
ered novel carboxylic ester hydrolase PE-H from P. aestusnigri [28] , and 
two mutants (FAST-PETase [29] :five mutations in IS PETase; LCC-ICCG 
[9] : four mutations in leaf-branch compost cutinase). We chose the 
optimal temperatures reported of these enzymes for comparison, and 
these temperatures were also used in the anchoring protein study above. 
The enzyme activity of these PET hydrolases varied greatly at different 
temperatures. At 37 ℃ , there was an evident peak in the relative enzyme 
activity of pGSA-PETase ( Fig. 1 E). Moving onto a slightly higher tem -
perature of 50 ℃ , pGSA-FAST exhibited the greatest relative enzyme 
activity. At 72 ℃ , pGSA-ICCG demonstrated the highest enzyme activ -
ity. Overall, the PET hydrolysis enzymes displayed were biologically 
functional and pGSA-FAST exhibited the highest enzyme activity at 
50 ℃ . 
However, relying solely on enzyme activity was insufficient to make 
a comprehensive comparison of the PET hydrolysis capability of these 
four surface-displayed E. coli . So, we used 4 g PET powder (200 mesh) as 
the substrate for hydrolysis. Due to slower hydrolysis performance at 
37
◦
C, we extended the reaction time to 72 h, whereas at other tem -
peratures, hydrolysis was still conducted for 24 h. Compared with the 
un-anchoring FAST-PETase, the pGSA-FAST-PETase surface-displayed 
bacteria actually improved the hydrolysis rate of PET powder ( Fig. 1 F). 
Consistent with the enzyme activity results, pGSA-FAST-PETase showed 
the highest hydrolysis efficiency for PET powder at 50 ℃ (24 h), with a 
weight loss rate of 71.3% ( Fig. 1 F). Furthermore, both ICCG and FAST- 
PETase demonstrated superior PET hydrolysis capabilities than IS PE -
Tase, in line with the primary objective of FAST-PETase and LCC-ICCG 
mutation, which aimed to enhance the wild-type enzyme ’ s thermal 
stability under high-temperature conditions and then increase its hy -
drolysis ability. Considering temperature, relative enzyme activity and 
weight loss rate of PET powder, FAST-PETase is a more optimal choice 
for PET hydrolysis. Then, we used molecular docking to analyze the 
binding affinity of the substrate PET3 (three PET molecules polymer -
ized). The results showed that besides common hydrogen bonding, other 
forces involved included van der Waals forces, hydrophobic

interactions, and various pi bonds ( Fig. 2 C). This suggests that it is not 
sufficient to consider only hydrogen bonding when optimizing the 
binding between substrate and hydrolase, and other forces play a non- 
negligible role in many cases [30] . 
Due to the complexity of bacterial membrane structure, proteins 
surface-displayed on bacterial outer membrane involves complex pro -
tein transport and transmembrane processes. Although these anchoring 
proteins have been demonstrated to be capable of displaying on surface 
theoretically, reasonable verification is still required for the surface- 
display of PET hydrolases. Here, three techniques and methods were 
used to demonstrate the successful display of FAST-PETase on the 
surface of E. coli . Firstly, we conducted a double-chamber experiment, 
wherein we placed a 0.22 µ m semipermeable membrane between two 
culture flasks connected to each other (SI Fig. S9 ). This device prevented 
the bacterial cells from penetrating the membrane but facilitated the 
protein molecule transportation, which was similar to the principle of 
dialysis. After a 72 h hydrolysis, the weight loss rate of PET particles was 
less than 2% (SI Fig. S13 ), demonstrating that PET plastics were mainly 
hydrolyzed by the FAST-PETase on the bacterial outer membrane, and 
the hydrolysis of PET showed a strong reliance on physical contact to 
surface-displayed bacteria. Secondly, we used enzyme-linked immuno -
magnetic bead precipitation, which the His-tagged magnetic bead

antibody was employed to bind with the His tag at pGSA-FAST-PETase 
C-terminal. After magnetic absorption, it was observed that pGSA- 
FAST-PETase medium became clear but the intracellular expression 
not (Fig. 2A). The OD
600 
of surface-displayed bacteria decreased from an 
initial value of 1.0–0.45, while the intracellular expression bacteria 
(pET30a-FAST-PETase) remained at around 0.98. Finally, we validated 
that the hydrolysis activity was mainly exerted by the protein anchored 
on the outer membrane through extracting the membrane protein of 
surface-displayed E. Coli. Without the pGSA anchoring, the enzyme ac -
tivity extracted from pET30a-FAST-PETase E. Coli membrane protein 
was substantially lower compared to pGSA-FAST-PETase, accounting for 
only 5.4% of the latter (Fig. 2B). Based on the above-mentioned three 
experiments, it can be unequivocally confirmed that FAST-PETase has 
been successfully anchored onto the outer membrane of the carrier cell. 
3.2. The protein structure of PET hydrolases determines their function and 
stability 
In this study, we used the original ISPETase, FAST-PETase, PE-H, and 
a mutant of leaf-branch compost cutinase known as ICCG. Considering 
the fact that these enzymes have proven their ability to efficiently break 
down PET, it is logical to assume that they possess certain structural 
similarities. At first, we aligned the amino acid sequences of these four 
enzymes and found that although they originated from different mi -
croorganisms and enzyme classifications, they shared a relatively high 
degree of amino acid similarity (~ 50% identity) and possessed the same 
catalytic triad (the exception of the S160A in ICCG) (SI Fig. S12). PE-H 
showed the greatest sequence difference from the other three, but even 
so, it shared more than 45% sequence homology with the PET hydro -
lases from S. viridis, Thermobifida sp. and I. sakaiensis[28]. Using MEME 
[31], all these four enzymes possessed the same conserved domains and 
the conserved domain positions (Fig. 2D). This may imply that the 
proteins with PET-hydrolyzing capability should exhibit similar or 
identical structures. However, the primary and secondary structures of 
proteins alone are not enough to explain their functional similarities and 
differences. Subsequently, we compared the crystal structures of these 
four proteins. Through structural overlay analysis, FAST-PETase 
exhibited an RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) value of just 0.22 Å 
compared to ISPETase (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the RMSD values for ICCG 
and PE-H (compared to ISPETase) were 1.41 Å and 1.88 Å, respectively, 
conforming well with the findings of the amino acid sequence analysis. 
Additionally, their structural similarities (TM score) were all greater 
than 0.9 (Fig. 2F), indicating a very high degree of structural similarity. 
After superimposing their protein structures, we observed that dispar -
ities in structure were predominantly limited to the disordered curves 
(Fig. 2E), while the alpha helices and beta sheets exhibited striking 
overlapping, especially for the catalytic triad. These findings suggested 
that even though these four proteins had the same structure, we may 
have mislabeled them for different classes. Therefore, we expanded the 
scope of our protein structure comparison. 
We screened 41 enzymes capable of hydrolyzing or degrading PET 
from the PDB database with available crystal structures, covering almost 
all of the PET hydrolyzing enzymes (Table 1). Because the structural 
differences between mutant proteins and their wild-type counterparts 
were relatively small, we only analyzed the structures of the wild-type 
proteins and ignored the structural information of the mutants. Based 
on EC classification and original literature descriptions, the 41 hydro -
lyzing enzymes were mainly classified into seven categories: ISPETase 
(the benchmark), cutinase, esterase, LCC, PEH (PET hydrolase), TfCut, 
and potential proteins capable of hydrolyzing PEH, which almost 
covered all reported PET-degrading enzyme types. USalign[19] (a new 
structure alignment algorithm) was used to compare the protein struc -
tures, with higher TM scores indicating more similar structures. Sur -
prisingly, using ISPETase as a benchmark, 36 of the 41 PDB structures 
had a TM value above 0.9 (Table 1 Structure 1), while the other five 
structures had much larger differences (TM values below 0.7), which 
these five proteins could be further classified into two types according to 
their similarity. In other words, only three types of protein structures 
were found from the PET-degrading enzymes, with ISPETase as the main 
representative (Table 1 Structure 1), and the other two types (Table 1 
Structure 2 and 3) were significantly different from it with a low pro -
portion. We overlaid these structures and found that the 36 proteins in 
Structures 1 were almost identical, with the PET-catalytic domain and 
the main alpha helix and beta-sheet frameworks completely over -
lapping, and the main differences were only found in the disordered 
protein curves (Fig. 3A Structure 1). The overlap rates between these 3 
structure types were relatively low, and their catalytic structural do -
mains were misaligned (Fig. 3A Structure 1 VS Structure 2 VS Structure 
3). Therefore, we question whether we have really discovered new 
PET-degrading enzymes? Here, we propose three structural types of 
PET-degrading enzymes: the main type represented by ISPETase, the 
second type represented by Fusarium oxysporum cutinase, and the third 
one represented by Chloroflexus sp. MS-G cutinase. Furthermore, it is 
worth noting that the discovery of TfCut[32] could date back to 2013, 
pre-dating the more recent discovery of ISPETase in 2016. We believe 
that confusion in naming or classification may have negative affect on 
the discovery of PET-degrading enzymes, and classification based purely 
on amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence similarity perhaps have 
certain errors. Classifying based on the similarity of protein crystal 
structure is more scientific and practical. 
Enzymes can only function if a stable protein structure is maintained, 
but as temperatures rising or other conditions changing, proteins will 
undergo inactivation and deformation, an important aspect of which is 
the structural changes in proteins, especially backbone changes. Previ -
ous studies had shown that protein structural stability was the key to 
improve PET hydrolysis temperature[9]. Fast-PETase was originally 
designed to improve the stability of ISPETase at high temperatures, as 
PET tended to be hydrolyzed at higher temperatures. However, the 
original paper did not perform molecular dynamics simulations, so we 
aimed to reveal the high-temperature tolerance mechanism of these 
enzymes from the perspective of protein structural stability using mo -
lecular dynamics simulation[33]. We chose two temperatures of 300 K 
and 330 K for a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, which covered 
the optimal enzymatic activity temperature of these four enzymes 
(Fig. 3D). The simulation results accorded with the previous experi -
mental data, FAST-PETase and ICCG exhibited better stability in protein 
backbone at both temperatures with RMSD below 0.15 A, while ISPE -
Tase’s stability decreased rapid at high temperatures with a higher 
RMSD. Not surprisingly, PEH had the poorest stability (highest RMSD) at 
both temperatures, which could explain why the hydrolytic activity of 
PEH decreases the fastest[34]. However, these results cannot explain 
why the hydrolytic activity of PEH is also lower than PETase at low 
temperatures. Therefore, we analyzed the protein surface charge inter -
action potential. ICCG, ISPETase and its derivatives FAST-PETase have 
cracks of about 5 Å at the triple catalytic site, while the catalytic groove 
of PEH is sealed by electrostatic potential energy (Fig. 3B). Experts 
believed that this cleft might be very important to accommodate crys -
talline semi-aromatic polyesters[35] and this may be an intrinsic reason 
for poor hydrolytic activity of PEH. Additionally, PE-H has the highest 
self-aggregation tendency via hydrophobic interactions (the lower the 
DI, the less liable to aggregate) and the least surface charge, in other 
words, FAST, ISPETase and ICCG are more stable than PE-H (Fig. 3C). 
The enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET exhibited similar crystal 
structures. Therefore, classification of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes should 
consider their crystal structures, which may facilitate the discovery of 
novel enzymes. In general, an excellent PET hydrolase should have 
robust protein skeleton for heat resistance, sufficiently wide catalytic 
groove to accommodate the PET chain, good affinity to the substrate 
PET, low self-aggregation tendency (less prone to intertwine between 
proteins) and reasonable surface charge to ensure its solubility in water, 
where computer-aided design can play an unexpected role.

3.3. Hydrolysis characteristics of FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli 
for PET 
Utilizing pNPB as the substrate, FAST-PETase surface-displayed 
E. coli exhibited optimal enzymatic activity at 50 ℃ (100%). At a higher 
temperature of 60 ℃ , the activity of FAST-PETase surface-displayed 
E. coli decreased to only 40% of its maximum activity, while the enzyme 
maintained a high activity of 71.2% at 42 ℃ ( Fig. 4 A). These findings 
suggest that FAST-PETase needs a specific temperature to exert its 
maximum hydrolytic activity and high temperature could weaken its 
activity quickly. FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli showed the 
highest activity at pH 8.5, with more than 80% activity remaining at pH 
8 and 9 ( Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, its hydrolytic activity at pH 6.0 was 
only 18.3%, which indicated that FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli 
was better adapted to alkaline conditions. In practical catalytic re -
actions, different metal cations might be present in the solution, and 
they could have certain impacts on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. 
Under the condition of additional 10 mM ion, we detected that Na

and Ca

could activate FAST-PETase with a maximum activation of 
123.2% ( Fig. 4 C). Previous studies have shown that the addition of

calcium ions could enhance the thermal stability of LCC [36] , because 
LCC had an extremely similar structure to FAST-PETase ( Table 1 ), thus it 
was reasonable to believe that calcium ions could also enhance the 
stability of other PET hydrolases. Based on our study, K

and Na
+
ions 
may have the same effect of Ca
2 +
. Although no direct metal-binding sites 
were identified in the crystal structures of these enzymes, some 
side-chain amino acids might possess potential for metal binding [9] . By 
contrast, Mg

, and Ni

had little effect on the enzymatic activity 
of pGSA-FAST-PETase. Mn
2 +
exhibited a certain inhibitory effect, but its 
residual activity was still maintained at a level of 89.4%, indicating that 
pGSA-FAST-PETase had good tolerance to most common metal ions. 
However, Fe
3 +
almost completely inhibited the activity of 
pGSA-FAST-PETase (enzyme activity dropped to 3.9%), which may be 
caused by protein denaturation induced by Fe
3 +
. 
Using self-purchased amorphous PET powder (200 mesh) as the 
substrate, we measured the weight loss of PET powder after hydrolysis 
for 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days. As shown in Fig. 4 D, after 1 day of 
hydrolysis by FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli, the weight loss of 
PET powder reached to 54.7%. Subsequently, PET hydrolysis became 
slow, and the hydrolysis rate only reached to 62.1% after 15 days. The 
hydrolysis rate remained stable from the 3rd day, and this might be 
directly related to the decrease in enzyme activity and the difficulty of 
hydrolyzing the PET-resistant part. Although FAST-PETase has 
improved its hydrolysis ability at high temperatures, future research 
should put more effort into how to improve its long-term thermal sta -
bility via amino acid mutations. To the best of our knowledge, how to 
shorten the length of the protein while ensuring the hydrolytic activity 
of PET may be a solution. 
In previous studies, we found that grinding PET plastic could greatly 
enhance its hydrolysis efficiency. Therefore, we believed that there was 
a certain relationship between the hydrolysis of PET and its particle size. 
We measured the weight loss of different sized PET powders (50, 200, 
500, 1000, 2000 mesh) using surface-displayed E. coli ( Fig. 4 E). Under 
the same hydrolysis temperature (50 ℃ , 24 h), the weight loss of PET 
powder with 50 mesh was only 34.1%, while it reached around 50% for 
the PET powder of 200 mesh. As the particle size of PET powder 
decreased, the hydrolysis rate by pGSA-FAST-PETase increased clearly 
and the hydrolysis rate of PET powder with 2000 mesh could reach up to 
68.4%. The reason may be that PET powder with smaller particle sizes 
have larger specific surface areas. When hydrolyzed by FAST-PETase 
surface-displayed E. coli , the powder with a larger specific surface area 
has more chance to contact with bacterial surface, resulting in a higher 
hydrolysis level [37] . 
Generally, the hydrolysis of PET is closely related to its crystallinity, 
with higher crystallinity resulting in poorer hydrolysis efficiency [29] . 
Unlike plastic products thermoformed, PET water bottles are produced 
through blow molding, which leads to a high degree of crystallization 
( > 25%) during the expansion process for most bottles [38] . The

crystallinity in the center of the bottle mouth and bottom was relatively 
low (1.2% and 12.7%, respectively), whereas the crystallinity in the 
body of the bottle was usually higher (32.6%) [29] . We cut these regions 
of PET bottle out, ground them (200 mesh), and treated them with 
FAST-PETase surface-displayed E. coli for 24 h at 50
◦
C. The results 
showed that the hydrolysis rate of the bottle neck reached to 52.9%, 
while the bottle base center was 31.4% ( Fig. 4 F). However, the hydro -
lysis rate in the bottle body was only 10.2%. These results indicated that 
plastic crystallinity could affect the hydrolysis of PET, with higher 
crystallinity leading to poorer hydrolysis efficiency. It has been pro -
posed that higher temperatures may facilitate the hydrolysis of PET, 
because PET will undergo glass transition at 70 ℃ [39] . However, after 
careful comparison, it has been established that FAST-PETase exhibits 
the efficient hydrolysis capacity at 50 ℃ . This evidence suggested that 
simply elevating hydrolysis temperature might not be the optimal so -
lution, and a more effective approach would be to design enzymes with 
appropriate structural characteristics. 
3.4. The change of PET surface morphology and properties after 
hydrolysis 
By surface-displayed E. coli hydrolysis, the main products of PET 
were MHET, TPA, and BHET (SI Fig. S14 A). MHET is the main product 
in the first step of PET hydrolysis and will be further hydrolyzed to TPA, 
while BHET is the by-product ( Fig. 4 G). Because BHET is solely found at 
the end of hydrolyzed polymer chains, its production yield is limited 
[14] . From a comprehensive view of the reaction process, equilibrium 
was reached at approximately 21 h after hydrolysis initiation, and the 
accumulation amount of MHET stabilized at around 18 h. Combined 
with the enzymatic activity findings, the reduced hydrolysis of PET 
could be attributed to two factors: a decline in enzyme activity, as well 
as a possible decrease in mass transfer rate that due to product accu -
mulation. After 24 h of hydrolysis by FAST-PETase surface-displayed 
E. coli , 250 mg PET powder produced about 8.5 mM MHET and 1.6 mM 
TPA ( Fig. 5 A), which FAST-PETase exhibited some ability to hydrolyze 
MHET to TPA. 
In order to obtain more intuitive evidence, we studied the changes of 
PET plastic after hydrolysis. SEM directly observed the morphological 
changes of PET plastics, which proved the hydrolysis and erosion of PET 
plastics by surface-displayed bacteria. SEM images of PET powder taken 
before hydrolysis showed a relatively smooth surface, while the surface 
became rough and pocked with numerous small pores after the hydro -
lysis of surface engineered E. coli ( Fig. 5 B). After hydrolysis, the PET 
powder became very fragmented, as a result, decreased in weight. 
FTIR is a valuable technique for monitoring the chemical bond 
cleavage and formation of functional groups in PET molecular chains. 
Further analysis using FITR indicated that hydrolysis promoted the 
oxidation of PET materials, resulting in a significant increase of oxygen- 
containing groups, with the most typical example being the more pro -
nounced peak in the C –
–
O absorption peak at 1713 cm-1 ( Fig. 5 C). 
Moreover, as the reaction proceeding, the relative intensity of the 
freestanding hydroxyl group at 3540 cm-1 weakened, indicating further 
oxidation of hydroxyl structures into acid and ester compounds might 
occur. These results are consistent with subsequent XPS analysis. 
By observing the changes in the C1s and O1s spectral peaks of XPS, 
the types of surface functional groups in PET can be determined. In XPS 
analysis, the C1s spectrum and O1s spectrum primarily reflects the 
chemical state and presence of carbon elements and oxygen elements, 
respectively, and the difference of PET hydrolysis was mainly in O1s. 
The peaks of high-resolution XPS-O1s spectra at 531.73 eV and 
533.34 eV could be attributed to C –
–
O and C-O, which represented the 
ester groups in PET. After hydrolysis of PET, the relative content of C –
–
O 
increased from 52.89% to 63.60%, while the relative content of C-O 
became 36.4% ( Fig. 5 D), which showed that surface-displayed engi -
neered bacteria participated in the oxidation of PET plastic and changed 
PET surface functional groups. We believe this is due to the hydrolysis of 
PET plastic, where more long chains are hydrolyzed into short chains, 
exposing carbonyl end groups. Additionally, combined with the results 
of SEM analysis, the surface of PET plastic becomes rough, leading to an 
increase in the proportion of carbonyl end groups. 
3.5. The recombinant proteins C-terminal has an effect on PET hydrolysis 
The main hydrolysis product of PET by FAST-PETase is MHET, and 
complete hydrolysis requires cooperative action between PETase and 
MHETase. Thus, we planned to co-display both MHETase and FAST- 
PETase through flexible peptide linkages (G4S), co-anchoring them in 
the outer membrane of E. coli ( Fig. 5 E). Since the two-enzyme system 
involved the question of which enzyme was more suitable at the C-ter -
minal (N-terminal is inside the membrane, C-terminal is outside), so the 
effect of the recombinant protein C-terminal region on PET hydrolysis 
was assessed. Regardless of which enzyme was located at the C-terminal, 
the two-enzyme system showed enhanced PET hydrolysis performance 
( Fig. 5 F and Fig. 4 D), suggesting that MHETase could break the hydro -
lysis decline caused by substrate MHET accumulation. Interestingly, the 
PET hydrolytic rate of the C-terminal pGSA-MHETase-g4s-FAST-PETase 
(84.6%) was slightly higher than the N-terminal one (pGSA-FAST- 
PETase-g4s-MHETase, 80.8%) after 24 h ( Fig. 5 F). Given that enzyme 
contact was essential for the hydrolysis of PET, the C-terminal end of 
recombinant protein offered a distinct advantage. And it also confirmed 
our previous hypothesis that substrate accumulation could affect the 
hydrolysis ability. Although it had been shown that MHETase and 
PETase could improve the hydrolysis efficiency of PET by cooperating 
with each other [40] , our study provided an new idea to achieve the 
coexistence of the two enzymes by the mean of surface co-display. It is 
worth mentioning that it has been found that MHETase has an 
exo-PETase activity, allowing hydrolysis PET at the terminal ester 
groups [41] , which further enhanced the hydrolysis ability. 
In addition to the difference in hydrolysis capacity, whether the 
hydrolyzed products are also different. So, we examined whether the 
hydrolysis products of the two recombinant proteins differed in PET 
hydrolysis (250 mg). Like the FAST-PETase surface-display system, both 
co-display fusion proteins generated MHET, TPA and BHET (SI Fig. S14 
B). However, there was a significant difference in the production of TPA 
and MHET between the two recombinant proteins. Specifically, C ter -
minal pGSA-MHETase-g4s-FAST-PETase yielded less TPA (6.9 mM TPA, 
4.2 mM MHET) ( Fig. 5 G). By contrast, pGSA-FAST-PETase-g4s- 
MHETase produced higher ratio of TPA (7.0 TPA mM and 3.3 mM 
MHET) ( Fig. 5 H). These results indicated that the C-terminal of the fused 
protein was the most favorable position, where FAST-PETase located at 
the C-terminal could lead to a higher degree of PET hydrolysis, while 
MEHTase located at the C-terminal resulted in more MHET hydrolysis. 
To gain more insight, it would be useful to explore the structural changes 
or conformational dynamics of fusion proteins when they are at different 
ends, and AlphaFold2 is helpful to gain the fusion proteins [42] . How -
ever, in general, for faster PET hydrolysis, FAST-PETase is more suitable 
at the C-terminal of co-display system.

Environmental Implication 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used 
plastics, and it has caused some adverse effects in the environment. We
