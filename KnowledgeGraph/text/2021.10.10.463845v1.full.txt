Abstract 14 
Plastic waste poses an ecological challenge 1. While current plastic waste management largely relies 15 
on unsustainable , energy-intensive, or even hazardous physicochemical and mechanical processes, 16 
enzymatic degradation offers a green and sustainable route for plastic waste recycling2. Poly(ethylene 17 
terephthalate) (PET) has been extensively used in packaging and for the manufacture of fabrics and 18 
single-used containers, accounting for 12% of global solid waste 3. The practical application of PET 19 
hydrolases has been hampered by the ir lack of robustness  and the requirement for high processing 20 
temperatures. Here, we use a structure-based, deep learning algorithm to engineer an extremely robust 21 
and highly active PET hydrolase. Our best resulting mutant (FAST-PETase: Functional, Active, Stable, 22 
and Tolerant PETase) exhibits superior PET -hydrolytic activity relative to both wild -type and 23 
engineered alternatives, (including a leaf -branch comp ost cutinase and its mutant 4) and possesses 24 
enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. We demonstrate that whole, untreated, post-consumer PET 25 
from 51 different plastic products can all be completely degraded by FAST-PETase within one week, 26 
and in as little as 24 hours at 50 ºC. Finally, we demonstrate two paths for closed-loop PET recycling 27 
and valorization. First, w e re-synthesize virgin PET from the monomers recovered after enzymatic 28 
depolymerization. Second, we enable in situ microbially-enabled valorization using a  Pseudomonas 29 
strain together with FAST-PETase to degrade PET and utilize the evolved monomers as a  carbon 30 
source for growth  and polyhydroxyalkanoate  production. Collectively, our results demonstrate the 31 
substantial improvements enabled by deep learning and a viable route for enzymatic plastic recycling 32 
at the industrial scale.  33

Manuscript Text 34 
 Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) composes 70% of synthetic textile fibers and 10% of non-35 
fiber plastic  packaging1, and correspondingly represents an enormous waste stream of single-use, 36 
manufactured materials. Yet, a circular carbon economy  for PET is theoretically attainable through 37 
rapid enzymatic depolymerization followed by either chemical repolymerization or microbial 38 
upcycling/valorization into other products5,6. However, all existing PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) 39 
are limited in their capacity to either function within moderate pH/temperature ranges or directly utilize 40 
untreated post-consumer plastics . Such traits are essential for in situ depolymerization and for 41 
simplified, low-cost industrial-scale processes7. To overcome these limitations , we employed deep 42 
learning and protein engineering approaches to generate a PHE that has exceptionally high activity 43 
across a broad range of raw PET substrates (both model and actual post -consumer PET (pc-PET)), 44 
temperatures, and pH levels  in a manner that out -performs all other known PHEs and rationally-45 
derived mutants. 46 
 Enzymatic depolymerization  of PET was  first reported in 2005  and has been nascently 47 
demonstrated using 19 distinct PHEs derived from esterases, lipases, and cutinases2,7,8. However, the 48 
majority of these enzymes only show appreciable hydrolytic activity at high reaction temperatures (i.e. 49 
at or exceeding the PET glass transition temperature of ca. 70 ºC) and with highly processed substrates. 50 
For example, an engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) can degrade 90% of pretreated pc-51 
PET within 10 hours  at 72 ºC and a pH of 8.04. Most other PHEs similarly show poor activity at 52 
moderate temperatures9 and more neutral pH condition s10, greatly restricting in situ  / microbially-53 
enabled degradation solutions for PET waste. This limitation is of  critical concern as 40% of 54 
uncollectable plastics reside in  natural environments 11. In addition , converting untreated post-55 
consumer plastic waste at near ambient temperature would be preferable for industrial applications, 56 
whereas elevated temperatures and pre-treatment increase net operating costs. 57

 While the PHE  from the PET-assimilating bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 9 (PETase) can 58 
operate at ambient conditions, it is highly labile and loses activity even at 37 ºC  after 24 hours 12, 59 
thereby limiting practical applications. Nonetheless, this mesophilic enzyme has previously seen 60 
attempts to enhance thermostability, robustness and function12–18. The most notable engineered PETase 61 
variants—ThermoPETase12 and DuraPETase 17—were created through rational protein engineering 62 
and computational redesign strategies, respectively. Although the thermostability and catalytic activity 63 
of these two mutants were improved12,17 under certain conditions, they nonetheless had overall lower 64 
PET-hydrolytic activity at mild temperatures. 65 
We posited that highly focused protein engineering approaches such as those described above 66 
cannot take into account  the evolutionary trade-off between overall stability and activity, and that a 67 
neutral, structure-based, deep learning  neural network might generally improve enzyme function  68 
across all conditions. To this end, we employed our 3D self-supervised, convolutional neural network, 69 
MutCompute19 (Supplementary Information Fig. 1) to identify stabilizing mutations . This algorithm 70 
learns the local chemical microenvironments of amino acids based on training over 19,000 sequence-71 
diverse protein structures from the Protein Data Bank and can readily predict positions within a protein 72 
where wild -type amino acids  are not optimized for their local environments . We employed 73 
MutCompute to obtain a discrete probability distribution for the structural fit of all 20 canonical amino 74 
acids at every position in both wild-type PETase and ThermoPETase (crystal structures PDB: 5XJH 75 
and 6IJ6)  (Supplementary Information  Fig. 2 ), essentially carrying out a comprehensive scanning 76 
mutagenesis of the protein in silico. The predicted distributions were rendered onto the protein crystal 77 
structure ( Fig. 1a ) to identify positions where wild -type amino acid  residues were ‘less fit’ than 78 
potential substitutions. Predictions were then ranked by predicted probabilities (fold-change of fit) (Fig. 79 
1b; Supplementary Information Fig. 3). Using a stepwise combination strategy, a total of 159 single 80 
or multiple predicted mutations were generated in various  PETase scaffolds. Variants exhibiting 81 
improved catalytic activity (as measured by esterase activity and plastic degradation rates) and 82

thermostability (as measured by protein melting temperature (T m)) were characterized further. 83 
Amongst this set, four predicted mutations (S121E, N233K, R224Q and T140D) (Fig 1c) resulted in 84 
the highest improvements, both singly and in combination, and were selected for further assembly and 85 
analysis (see Additional Supplementary Discussion in Supplementary Information Fig. 4 for a further 86 
discussion of the mutant down-select).  Encouragingly, two substitutions ( S121E and T140D) were 87 
reported in the literature after our initial predictions, whereas the remaining residues are entirely unique, 88 
thus emphasizing the importance of a neutral , deep learning -based approach to identifying critical 89 
substitutions.  90 
We assembled all 29 possible combinations using these four mutations across three PETase 91 
scaffolds (wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, and DuraPETase). Of note, two could not be purified 92 
using the DuraPETase background after multiple attempts. Thermostability analysis of the remaining 93 
27 mutants indicated that 24 ( ca. 89%) resulted in elevated Tm relative to their respective scaffolds 94 
(Supplementary Information  Fig. 5 ). The highest change in thermostability from their respective 95 
PETase scaffolds were observed for variants PETaseN233K/T140D with a Tm of 58.1 ºC (ΔTm=10 ºC from 96 
WT PETase), ThermoPETaseN233K/R224Q with a Tm of 67.4 ºC (ΔTm=9 ºC from ThermoPETase), and 97 
DuraPETaseN233K with a Tm of 83.5 ºC (ΔTm=5 ºC from DuraPETase). The latter mutant represents the 98 
most thermostable PETase mutant reported to date. It was noted that the protein yield of all 27 variants 99 
was improved (up to 3.8-fold increase) compared with the parental scaffold, further underscoring the 100 
ability of Mutcompute to identify mutants of higher stability (Supplementary Information Fig. 6). The 101 
portability and combinatorial synergy of these mutations across scaffolds demonstrates the power of 102 
this neural network-based approach.  103 
Next, we sought to evaluate the PET hydrolytic activity of these more stable variants across a 104 
range of temperatures from  30 to 60 ºC using an amorphous PET film (gf-PET, from the supplier 105 
Goodfellow, PA, USA) commonly used in the literature4. This comparison immediately revealed that 106 
the machine-learning guided predictions greatly enhanced PET-hydrolytic activity and extended the 107

range of working temperature in all scaffolds (Fig. 1d). In particular, PETase N233K/R224Q/S121E exhibited 108 
a 3.4-fold and 29-fold increase in PET-hydrolytic activity at 30 and 40 ºC respectively, over wild-type 109 
PETase (Fig. 1d). Enzyme mutants based on the ThermoPETase scaffold showed an extended range 110 
of working temperature (30-60 ⁰C) and exhibited significantly higher activity than their counterparts. 111 
Within this set, the best variant from the ThermoPETase scaffold (containing N233K and R224Q on 112 
top of S121E), named FAST-PETase (Functional, Active, Stable, and Tolerant PETase), showed 2.4-113 
fold and 38-fold higher activity at 40 and 50 ⁰C, respectively compared to ThermoPETase alone (Fig. 114 
1d). At 50 ⁰C, FAST-PETase displayed the highest overall degradation of all mutants and temperatures 115 
activity releasing 33.8 mM  of PET monomers in 96 hours (Fig. 1d). The DuraPETase scaffold in 116 
general exhibited relatively low activity at mild temperatures (30 –50 ⁰C), but improvements were 117 
nevertheless realized a t higher temperatures (55–60 ⁰C) as demonstrated by the most thermostable 118 
PETase mutant- DuraPETaseN233K (Fig. 1d).  119 
Crystal structure analysis of FAST-PETase at 1.44 Å resolution explains the enhanced stability 120 
through newly formed,  favorable residue interactions (Fig. 2). The N233K mutation places a 121 
positively-charged lysine next to E204 and establishes an intramolecular salt bridge (Fig. 2f). The side 122 
chain of R224, when mutated to Gln, forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of S192 (Fig. 2d). 123 
Finally, the S121E mutation enables a new water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network with H186 and 124 
N172 (Fig. 2d). 125 
 To evaluate the catalytic resilience of these mutants to environmental conditions, FAST-126 
PETase were compared to previously reported wild-type and mutant PHEs including wild-type PETase, 127 
ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC, the most active mutant LCC  F243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM) using 128 
gf-PET across a range of pH (6.5 – 8.0) and temperatures (30-40 ⁰C) (Supplementary Information Fig. 129 
7). This comparative analysis demonstrated the unique catalytic capability of FAST-PETase to 130 
function at low pH levels and ambient temperature. Specifically, FAST-PETase outperformed other 131 
PHEs (including prior rational designs) at all pH conditions. Especially at pH 7, FAST-PETase 132

exhibited activities that were 9.7 and 115 times as high as that of wild -type PETase at 30 and 40 ⁰C, 133 
respectively (Supplementary Information Fig. 7). This enzymatic performance makes FAST-PETase 134 
an excellent candidate for mild temperatures and moderate pH enzymatic degradation of PET seen in 135 
conditions of in situ plastic degradation.  136 
 Beyond model plastic substrates, it is critical to demonstrate the performance of PETase 137 
enzymes on raw, untreated pc -PET. Notably, unlike the gf -PET used above and throughout the 138 
literature, there is no singular pcPET substrate. To this end, we collected 51 samples of post-consumer 139 
plastic products used in the packaging of  food, beverages, medications, office supplies, household 140 
goods and cosmetics available at local grocery store chains and treated this raw material enzymatically 141 
with FAST-PETase at 50 ºC (Supplementary Information Fig. 8). Despite their heterogeneity including 142 
physical properties such as crystallinity , molecular weight, and thickness as well as different 143 
compositions including additives and plasticizers, hole-punched samples from this wide array of PET 144 
products were all fully degraded by FAST-PETase within one week and in as little as 24 hours  (Fig. 145 
3a). While thickness of the plastic did correlate with degradation time (as thickness and mass are 146 
related), neither this metric nor crystallinity or any other measured trait of PET alone determined 147 
overall degradation rates (Supplementary Information Fig. 9). 148 
Among the post-consumer products tested above, we further evaluated the sample from a bean 149 
cake container that was completely degraded by FAST-PETase within 24 hrs at 50 ⁰C. A time-course 150 
analysis (Fig. 3b) revealed that the degradation of this pc -PET film exhibited an almost linear decay 151 
rate using FAST-PETase in terms of the total PET monomers released. Concomitantly, degradation of 152 
the pc-PET film by FAST-PETase brought an increase in the crystallinity from 1.2 % to 7.7% over 24 153 
hrs (Supplementary Information Fig. 10). Atomic Force Microscopy (Fig. 3c) as well as Scanning 154 
Electron Microscopy (Supplementary Information  Fig. 1 1) further showed  that the reaction 155 
progression of FAST-PETase as it produced increasingly deeper and larger holes in the pc-PET surface 156 
resulting in increased surface roughness (and visible opaqueness) over reaction time (Supplementary 157

Information Fig. 12). In contrast, t he PET-hydrolytic activity of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, 158 
DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM toward this pc-PET was substantially lower (3.2 to 141.6-fold) than that 159 
of FAST-PETase under the same conditions (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, even at their previously reported 160 
optimal reaction temperature of 72 ⁰C 4, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still 4.9-fold and 1.5-fold 161 
lower than that of FAST-PETase at 50 ⁰C. Further experimental analysis (Supplementary Information 162 
Fig. 13) indicated that LCC and ICCM exhibited the ir highest degradation rate against this pc -PET 163 
film at 60 ⁰C. However, even at 60⁰C, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still lower than that of FAST-164 
PETase at 50 ⁰C. Moreover, we demonstrate that the depolymerization process with FAST-PETase is 165 
easily scalable to large, untreated pieces of plastic (in this case, 6.4 g rather than 11 mg) simply by 166 
increasing net reaction volumes (Fig. 3d). Given these results, FAST-PETase can serve as a promising 167 
biocatalyst for the enzyme-based platform aimed at recycling raw, untreated PET waste , with  168 
advantages of lower operating cost and higher degradation efficiency of pc-PET, in contrast to ICCM 169 
that requires a higher reaction temperature.  170 
Beyond packaging materials, PET is used heavily in the synthetic textile industry. To this end, 171 
we evaluated the potential application of FAST-PETase to partially degrade commercial polyester 172 
products. Five different commercial polyester products were treated with FAST-PETase at 50  ⁰C, 173 
releasing higher amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET) 174 
relative to that of the samples treated with other PHEs (Fig. 3e). This indicates that FAST-PETase can 175 
potentially be used for rapid and efficient degradation of the PET fragments embedded in textile fabrics, 176 
providing a potential route for recovering PET monomers from commercial polyester products and 177 
reducing the leaching of microfibers into the environment. 178 
Given the high activity of this FAST-PETase mutant at ambient temperatures and pH 179 
conditions, we hypothesized that this enzyme would be suitable for various enzymatic -microbial and 180 
enzymatic-chemical processing of PET. In this regard, PET depolymerization is only half of the 181 
circular plastic economy and we demonstrate here the compatibility of FAST-PETase with both 182

chemical and biological recycling/upcycling application s to close the cycle . First, we demonstrate a 183 
closed-cycle PET re-constitution by first depolymerizing a tinted post-consumer plastic waste utilizing 184 
FAST-PETase and subsequently recovering monome rs. TPA was recovered from the degradation 185 
solution with a yield of 96.8% and with a purity of over 99%. We then regenerate virgin PET directly 186 
from the degradation solution  using chemical polymerization  (Fig. 4a ). A complete cycle of 187 
degradation to re -polymerization can be accomplished in as little as a few days  (Supplementary 188 
Information Fig. 14). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a closed -loop enzymatic/chemical 189 
recycling process to generate a clear, virgin PET film from non-petroleum resources. Moreover, this 190 
workflow bypasses the challenges of recycling mixed-color PET products. 191 
Second, we sought to utilize the degradation capability of FAST-PETase at ambient 192 
temperature to enable direct depolymerization and microbial valorization of monomers. To this end, 193 
we evaluated a simultaneous biodegradation  scheme using FAST-PETase to demonstrate that this 194 
mutant enzyme is microbe -compatible. In particular, a soil bacteria Pseudomonas putida Go1920,21 195 
capable of naturally utilizing TPA as a carbon and energy sour ce and capable of producing 196 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was employed . Initially, we sought to combine exogenous FAST-197 
PETase with this host to explore the possibility of simultaneous PET depolymerization and 198 
fermentation. P. putida  Go19 was inoculated into a minimal medium supplemented with an 199 
unpretreated pc-PET film absent of any other carbon source. Upon adding 200 nM of purified FAST-200 
PETase to the culture medium, growth of P. putida Go19 was observed concomitant with the degraded 201 
pc-PET film which displayed opacity and lost 20.2 ± 2.1% of its initial weight (Fig. 4b) after 4 days. 202 
Through this experiment, we observed t hat the TPA liberated from the hydrolysis of pc -PET film by 203 
FAST-PETase was consumed by the P. putida Go19 for growth (Fig. 4b) and PHAs accumulation (Fig. 204 
4c). In contrast, when wild -type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase , LCC, or ICCM was used as 205 
the catalyst in such process, the cell density of P. putida Go 19 and the weight loss of the pc-PET film 206 
were all significantly lower than when FAST-PETase was used (Fig. 4b). These results demonstrated 207

that FAST-PETase exhibited the highest PET -hydrolytic activity under cell -growth compatible 208 
conditions when compared with other PHEs tested. This demonstration represents the first 209 
simultaneous bioprocess that integrates enzymatic PET depolymerization and TPA conversion to  210 
PHAs at ambient temperatures and neutral pH. 211 
              In conclusion, this work utilized a structure-based deep learning model  to identify portable 212 
substitutions that imparted improved stability and function across a variety of PETase scaffolds. The 213 
best variant, FAST-PETase, exhibits superior activity over a wide range of temperatures (30–50 ⁰C), 214 
and exceptional compatibility with cell-growth conditions. We demonstrate this capacity via the rapid, 215 
efficient, and complete degradation of bulk, untreated pc-PET waste and a reduction of PET fragments 216 
embedded in textile fabrics. The properties of this variant are ultimately suitable for both low -cost 217 
industrial recycling as well as  for in situ plastic degradation applications, as demonstrate d by 218 
simultaneous bioprocessing with P. putida Go 19. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential 219 
for structure-based deep learning in protein engineering and the opportunities for converting 220 
mesophilic enzyme scaffolds into broad-range biocatalysts for a cyclic plastic economy.   221

Fig. 1  Machine-learning guided predictions  improve enzyme performance across PETase 273 
scaffolds. a. Wild-type PETase protein structure rendered by the output of Mutcompute. Each amino 274 
acid residue was  assessed by Mutcompute, resulting in a probability distribution reflecting the 275 
chemical congruency of each of the twenty amino acids with the neighboring chemical 276 
microenvironments. Residues assigned the low wild-type probability (disfavored) are red and the high 277 
wild-type probability (favored) are blue . Interactive visualizations of MutCompute are available at  278 
https://www.mutcompute.com/petase/5xjh and https://www.mutcompute.com/petase/6ij6. b. Using 279 
MutCompute with both wild -type PETa se and ThermoPETase, two libraries of predictions were 280 
generated. To down-select mutations , t he predictions were ranked by the fold change in the 281 
probabilities between the predicted and the wild -type amino acid. Using a stepwise combination 282 
strategy, 159 v ariants were generated by incorporating single or multiple predicted mutations into 283 
various PETase scaffolds. After experimental characterization, four predicted mutations (S121E, 284 
N233K, R224Q and T140D) resulted in the highest improvements both singly and in combination. c. 285

Supplementary Methods 367 
Supplementary Methods 1: Description of methods 368 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: 369 
MutCompute19 is a 3D CNN model where the architecture consists of nine la yers divided into two 370 
blocks: 1) feature extraction and 2) classification. The feature extraction block consisted of six layers: 371 
two pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by a dimension reduction max pooling layer after each 372 
pair. The first pair of convolutional layers used filters of size 3x3x3 and the second pair had filters of 373 
size 2x2x2. Additionally, the Rectified Linearity Unit function (Relu) was applied to the output of each 374 
of the four convolutional layers. The final feature maps generated by t he feature extraction block had 375 
dimensions of size 400x3x3x3. These feature maps were flattened into a 1D vector of size 10,800 376 
before being passed to the classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully 377 
connected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2, and 0, respectively. Like the feature extraction 378 
block, the output of the first two dense layers was transformed by the Relu function. To obtain a vector 379 
of 20 probability scores representing the network prediction for each of the amino acids, we applied a 380 
softmax activation function to the output of the third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a 381 
machine learning as a service (MLaaS) on https://mutcompute.com.  382 
MutCompute Predictions: 383 
MutCompute predictions were obtained by running the wild type PETase (pdb id: 5xjh) and 384 
thermopetase (pdb id: 6ij6) through our MLaaS at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered by 385 
sorting by the probability assigned to the wild type amino acid. We filtered 34  and 39 residues from 386 
the wild type PETase and Thermopetase crystal structures, respectively. From these filtered residues, 387 
we prioritized our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the 10 residues from each crystal structure 388 
with the highest log2 fold chan ge between the predicted amino acid and wild type amino acid 389 
probabilities. Prior to experimentation, selected residues were visualized with Mutcompute -View, 390

which is built on top of NGLViewer (https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl), to ensure three things: 1) the 391 
prediction was chemically sound and not due to a crystal or model artifact, 2) we were avoiding the 392 
active site and binding pocket and 3) avoiding epistatic interactions between predictions and instead 393 
targeting predicted “instability hotspots”. MutCom pute-View has been made publicly available at 394

 396 
Protein crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, data processing, and model 397 
refinement 398 
To identify crystallization conditions for FAST-PETase, a sample containing 6 mg/mL purified FAST-399 
PETase was screened in sparse -matrix screening using Phoenix robotic system (Art Robinson). The 400 
initial hits were identified with the rod -shaped crystals formed after incubating screening plates at 401 
25 °C for three days. The crystallization was optimized as 0.1 M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M Ammonium Sulfate, 402 
pH 5.5 setup as sitting-drop vapor diffusion.  403 
 404 
Individual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotected with 405 
30 % (v/v) glycerol. X -ray diffraction data were  collected at 23 -ID-B beamline in Advance Photon 406 
Source (Lemont, IL). The X -ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44Å resolution for FAST -407 
PETase crystals using HKL2000 22. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with 408 
ThermoPETase structure as the initial search model (PDB code 6IJ6 12). The molecular replacement 409 
solution for FAST -PETase structure was iteratively buil t and refined using Coot 23 and Phenix 24 410 
refinement package. Procheck and MolProbity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST -PETase 411 
structure. The final statistics for data collec tion and structural determination are shown in 412

Cloning 415 
Genes encoding Ideonella sakaiensis  201-F6 IsPETase (wild-type PETase) (Genbank: 416 
BBYR01000074, ISF6_4831), its mutants —PETase S121E/D186H/R280A (ThermoPETase12) and 417 
PETaseS214H/I168R/W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/T140D (DuraPETase17), leaf -branch compost 418 
cutinase (LCC) (Genbank: AEV21261) and its mutant LCC  F243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM)4 were 419 
commercially synthesized for cloning. To enable e xtracellular expression of PETase and its mutants 420 
in Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide —421 
SPpstu (21 amino acids) from maltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-1925 was 422 
used to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 amino acids) of wild-type PETase. The 423 
wild-type PETase and its mutants’ genes with SPpstu presented at the N -terminus were amplified by 424 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 425 
Assembly method, DNA fragments encoding wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase 426 
were respectively subcloned into a modified pBTK552 vector26 where the antibiotic resistance marker 427 
was swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a C -terminal hexa-histidine tag-428 
coding sequence was added. To enable intracellular expression of LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli 429 
(DE3) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) , the nucleotide sequence encoding the original signal 430 
peptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide 431 
sequence were amplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, using Gibson 432 
Assembly method, the DNA fragments encoding LCC and ICCM were respectively subcloned into a 433 
commercial vector-pET-21b (Novagen, San Diego, CA), which carry a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-434 
coding sequence. The electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10β was transformed with the Gibson Assembly 435 
product by following a standard electroporation protocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was 436 
extracted from the overnight culture of the cloning host by using the  QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit 437 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA sequence of extracted plasmid was verified by Sanger sequencing. 438

 441 
Variant construction 442 
Variants of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were generated through site-directed 443 
mutagenesis using the PCR method described in the Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit E0552S (New 444 
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The constructed plasmids carrying wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase 445 
and DuraPETase genes were used as the templates for mutagenesis PCR reaction. The corresponding 446 
primer sequences and annealing temperature were designed and generated by using the 447 
NEBaseChanger™ tool. Stellar™ Competent Cells ( Clontech Laboratories,  Mountain View, CA ) 448 
were used as the cloning host and transformed with the ligated plasmids using the heat-shock method 449 
provided in the manufacturer’s instruction. Plasmid extraction and sequencing for the variants were 450 
performed under the same conditions as described for plasmids carrying wild-type PETase, 451 
ThermoPETase and DuraPETase genes. 452 
 453 
Protein expression and purification 454 
For extracellular protein expression of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, and their 455 
variants, P. putida  KT2440 was used as the expression host and its e lectrocompetent cell was 456 
transformed with the corresponding constructed plasmids. For intracellular protein expression of LCC 457 
and ICCM, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as the expression host and its electrocompetent cell was 458 
transformed with the corresponding constructed plasmids. A single colony of an P. putida KT2440 or 459 
E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain harboring one of the constructed plasmids was inoculated into 2 mL of Luria 460 
Bertani broth (LB) medium with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C/225 rpm. The 461 
overnight-grown culture (using 150 µl) was scaled up with 1000 -fold dilution in a 500 -mL triple 462

baffled shake flask and grown to a cell density of 0.8 (optical density [OD 600]) at 37 °C/2 25 rpm. 463 
Protein expression was induced by adding 0.2 mM of isopropyl β -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 464 
and cells were cultured for 24 hrs at 30 °C/225 rpm. For isolation of the extracellularly expressed 465 
PETase enzymes, the induced cell culture was centrifuged at 14,000 g and 4 ⁰C for 20 mins to obtain 466 
the supernatant that accommodates secretory protein. For isolation of the intracellularly expressed 467 
LCC and ICCM, the induced cell culture was harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g and 4 ⁰C for 20 468 
mins. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 25 mL of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) 469 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA ) pH 7.0  buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, 1 g/L of 470 
lysozyme and 5 µl of Pierce™ Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 471 
followed by mixing on a rocker for 20 mins at 4 ⁰C. Subsequently, cells were lysed by sonication and 472 
the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 g and 4 ⁰C for 20 mins to obtain the supernatant that 473 
contains soluble proteins. Target proteins from the above two type of supernatants were both purified 474 
by HisPur™ Ni -NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the 475 
manufacturer’s instruction. Desalting of the protein eluent was carried out by using Sephadex G-25 476 
PD-10 columns  (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction . All 477 
purification and desalting steps were performed at 4° C in a cold room. Afterwards, the purified protein 478 
was concentrated to a final volume of 1 mL by the 50 mL, 10KDa cut-off Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal 479 
Filters device (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) and preserved in DPBS (pH 7.0). The 480 
protein concentration was then determined by using the Coomassie Plus Bradford Assay kit (Thermo 481 
Fisher Scientific) and the Infinite M200 PRO microplate reader (Teca n, Männedorf, Switzerland) to 482 
measure the absorbance of assay mixtures. The presence and purity of the purified proteins were 483 
assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  484

In Vitro Analysis of PET hydrolytic activity using commercial Goodfellow PET film (gf-PET) 486 
To evaluate the PET hydrolytic activity of PETase and its variants, the homogenous amorphous gf -487 
PET film (Goodfellow, U.S. 577 -529-50; specification: 1.3-1.4 g cm -3 density, 1.58-1.64 refractive 488 
index, 100x10-13 cm3. cm cm -2 s-1 Pa-1 permeability to water @25 °C, 20-80 x10-6 K-1 coefficient of 489 
thermal expansion, 0.13-0.15 W m-1 K-1 @23°C thermal conductivity) was used as the substrate for 490 
degradation assays with the purified PETase enzyme and its variants. The gf-PET film was prepared 491 
in a circular form (6 mm in diameter, ~11.4 mg) and was washed three times with 1 % SDS, 20 % 492 
ethanol, and deionized water before usage.  Subsequently, the gf -PET film was put into a glass test 493 
tube and fully submerged in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified 494 
enzyme. The test tube was tightly capped and wrapped with parafilm to minimize volatilization. The 495 
reaction mixture was then incubated at 30/40/50/55/60 °C for 96 hrs. Followed by removing the 496 
enzyme-treated gf-PET film from the reaction mixture, the enzyme reaction was terminated by heating 497

The supernatant of each sample was further analyzed by High-performance liquid chromatography 499 
(HPLC) for quantifying PET monomers released from the PET depolymerization.  500 
To compare the PET hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase with wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, 501 
DuraPETase, LCC, and ICCM across a range of pH (6.5 – 8.0) at 30 ⁰C and 40 ⁰C, similar experimental 502 
setup was used. The circular gf-PET film (6 mm diameter, ~11.4 mg) was used as the substrate. The 503 
enzyme reactions were performed with 200 nM purified enzyme in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH 504 
buffer with various pH (6.5, 7.0, 7.5 or 8.0) at 30 ⁰C and 40 ⁰C. After incubating the enzyme reaction 505 
for 96 hrs, the supernatant of the reaction mixture was also analyzed by HPLC for quantifying PET 506

Degradation of post-consumer PET (pc-PET) plastics 509 
Hole-punched pc-PET films (6 mm in diameter) from 51 post-consumer plastic products were serially 510 
treated by 200 nM FAST-PETase in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 ⁰C. Fresh 511 
enzyme solution was replenished every 24 hrs to maximize enzymatic degradation rate for degrading 512 
the 51 samples of various pc-PET films.  513 
The time -course analysis of degrading a pc -PET film ( Bean cake container) by various PET-514 
hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) was conducted at 50 ⁰C. The reactions were perf ormed with 200 nM 515 
enzyme in 600 µl of 100 mM KH 2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) and terminated at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 18 hrs 516 
or 24 hrs for quantifying total PET monomers released at each time point. 517 
A large, untreated, and transparent pc -PET (Bean cake container, 6.4 g) was treated by 200 nM of 518 
FAST-PETase in 100 mM of KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 ⁰C. The whole piece of transparent 519 
PET container was fully submerged in 2.5 L of enzyme solution and completely degraded after 48 hrs.  520 
 521 
Degradation of polyester product 522 
Five different commercial polyester products were cut into small pieces and used as the substrates that 523 
were fully submerged in 600 µl of 100 mM KH 2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM p urified 524 
enzyme. Enzyme treatment on these five polyester products was conducted at 50 ⁰C. After 24 hrs of 525 
incubation, the reaction was terminated. The enzyme degradation solution was used to determine how 526 
much PET monomers were released from hydrolyzing these polyester products by various PHEs.   527 
Degradation of large, untreated pc-PET container and regeneration of virgin PET  528 
A large, untreated, and green colored pc-PET container was cut into small rectangular flakes (ca. 1cm 529

KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 ⁰C. 200 nM  of fresh enzyme was added to the degradation 531 
solution every 24 hrs to maximize enzymatic degradation rate. All the colored pc-PET fragments were 532 
completely degraded after 6 days. 533 
Upon completion of degradation, the enzyme degradation solution was filtered, and the filtrate was 534 
collected for regeneration. The pH of the filtrate was adjusted to pH 11 with NaOH to hyd rolyze 535 
remaining MHET. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 hrs to complete the hydrolysis. 536 
The pH of the solution was subsequently adjusted to 2 with 37% HCl. The precipitate was filtered and 537 
washed several times with deionized water and dri ed under vacuum overnight. 4.3 g of TPA was 538 
collected and used in the next step without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO): 8.03 539 
ppm (s, 4H).  540 
To a suspension of TPA (4.31 g, 25.9 mmol) in CH 3OH (150 mL), 95% H 2SO4 (2.0 mL) was added 541 
dropwise at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at reflux for 24 hrs and became a clear solution. 542 
The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. DMT was subsequently recrystallized from 543 
the reaction mixture and collected after filtration. These white crystals were washed with cold CH3OH 544 
and dried under vacuum for 4 hrs to afford DMT (4.12 g) with a yield of 82%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, 545 
CDCl3): 8.08 ppm (s, 4H), 3.93 ppm (s, 6H).  546 
To a three-necked round bottom flask equipped with an air condenser, DMT (4.12 g, 21.1 mmol) was 547 
added. The flask was evacuated under vacuum and refilled with nitrogen gas for three times. Ethylene 548 
glycol (1.20 mL, 21.5 mmol) was added, followed by the addition of titanium isopropoxide (0.06 mL, 549 
0.21 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 160 °C for 1 hour, 200 °C for 1 hour, and 210 °C for 2 hrs 550 
under nitrogen. The reaction temperature was further increased to 260 °C, and high vacuum was 551 
applied to remove unreacted monomers. The mixture was stirred at 260 °C for 2 hrs and then cooled 552 
to room temperature. The resulting PET was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3 -hexafluoro-2-propanol (10 mL) 553

and added dropwise to CH3OH to remove the catalyst. PET (2.83 g) was collected as white solids after 554 
centrifuging and dried under vacuum.  555 
Simultaneous bioprocess combing P. putida Go19 and exogenous PHEs 556 
The simultaneous process experiments were performed using nitrogen-limiting M9 medium (NL-M9) 557 
containing M9 Minimal Salts ( Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO ), 1 g/L  NaNH4HPO4‧4H2O, 0.34 g/L 558 
thiamine hydrochloride, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM CaCl2. P. putida Go19 (accession number NCIMB 559 
41537) was purchased from National Collection of Industrial, Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB 560 
Aberdeen, Scotland, UK). A single colony of P. putida Go19 was inoculated into 20 mL of LB medium 561 
and grown overnight at 30 °C/225 rpm. The overnight‐grown culture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 562 
mins. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 20 mL of NL-M9 medium without any carbon source. The 563 
resuspended cells used as inoculum for simultaneous process condition where P. putida Go19 and 564 
exogenous PHEs were combined to explore the possibility of simultaneous PET depolymerization and 565 
fermentation. Subsequently, P. putida Go19 was inoculated into 1 mL of NL-M9 medium (to an OD600 566 
of 0.2) supplemented with an unpretreated circular pc-PET film (hole-punched from a cookies plastic 567 
container; 6 mm in diameter and weigh around 6 mg) absent of any other carbon source in a culture 568 
tube. 200 nM of exogenous enzyme (FAST-PETase, wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, 569 
LCC or ICCM) was added to the 1 mL NL -M9 medium inoculated with P. putida  Go19 as the 570 
simultaneous process condition. 200 nM of enzymes were also respectively added to the 1 mL of NL-571 
M9 medium absent of P. putida Go19 as the control condition. All conditions were incubated at 37 ⁰C 572 
and 165 RPM for 72 hrs, followed by incubation at 30 ⁰C and 225 RPM for another 24 hrs to maximize 573 
PHAs production in P. putida Go19. The experiments were all performed in biological triplicates. PET 574 
monomers concentration of the NL-M9 medium with or without P. putida Go19, mass loss of the pc-575 
PET films, PHAs accumulation  and cell density of P. putida Go19 were determined after 96 hrs of 576 
incubation.  577

Analytical method for measuring PET monomers released 579 
HPLC was used to analyze the PET monomers – terephthalic acid (TPA) and Mono -(2-580 
hydroxyethyl)terephthalic (MHET)  released from PET depolymerization. The assay samples were 581 
filtered with 0.2 -μm nylon syringe filters (Wheaton Science,  Millville, NJ) prior to running HPLC. 582 
Measurement of TPA and MHET was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher 583 
Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) 584 
with detection wavelength at 260 nm. Column oven was held at 30 °C with 1% acetic acid in water or 585 
1% acetic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase over the course of the 30 -min sequence under the 586 
following conditions: 1% to 5% organic (vol/vol) for 5 min, 5% to 100% organic (vol/vol) for 8 m in, 587 
100% organic (vol/vol) for 10 min, 100% to 5% organic for 2 min followed by 5% organic for 5 min. 588 
The flow rate was fixed at 0.8 mL min -1. A standard curve was prepared using commercial TPA 589 
with ≥ 98.0% purity or MHET ≥  98.0% purity (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). 590 
 591 
Analytical method for measuring melting temperature (Tm). of proteins 592 
To evaluate the thermostability of wild -type PETase and its variants, Differential Scanning 593 
Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine their respective T m. Purified protein sa mples were 594 
concentrated to 300~500 µM using Microcon® Centrifugal Filter 10K Devices (Millipore, Billerica, 595 
MA). 10 µL of concentrated protein solution (DPBS buffer pH 7.0) was placed in an aluminum Tzero 596 
pan and sealed with a Tzero  hermetic lid (TA Instruments, DE New Caste, DE).  Tm of the protein 597 
samples was analyzed by a DSC250 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) with a RCS90 electric chiller. 598 
Two DSC procedures were used depending on the anticipated denaturation temperature of the protein. 599 
The first DSC method heated from 40 °C to 90 ° C at 10 °C/min, held at 90 °C for two minutes, then 600

cooled from 90 °C to 40 ° C at –10 °C/min. The second method heated from 20 °C to 70 ° C at 10 601 
°C/min, held at 70 °C for two minutes, cooled from 70 °C to 40 °C at –10 °C/min. The denaturation 602 
temperature of the proteins was measured on the heating ramp trace as the midpoint value at half -603 
height.  604 
Analytical method for determining PET film crystallinity 605 
DSC was used to determine percent crystallinity of t he PET films hole-punched from the post -606 
consumer plastics. PET film samples (4–10.5 mg) were placed in aluminum Tzero pans with a Tzero 607 
solid sample lid. Samples were run first heated from 40 °C to 300 ° C at 5 °C/min, held at 300 °C for 608 
one minute, cooled from 300 °C to 30 °C at –5 °C/min, held at 30 °C for one minute in a DSC250 (TA 609 
Instruments, New Castle, DE) with a RCS90 electric chiller. The percent crystallinity was determined 610 
on the first heating scan using the enthalpies of melting and cold crystallization. The equation used to 611 
calculate percent crystallinity within the PET film was the following 612 
 % 𝑐𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 = ቂ
𝛥𝐻𝑚−𝛥𝐻𝑐𝑐
𝛥𝐻𝑚˚ ቃ × 100   613 
where ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting (J/g), ΔHcc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization (J/g), and ΔHm° 614 
is the enthalpy of melting for a 100% crystalline PET sample, which is 140.1 J/g 4,27. ΔHm and ΔHcc 615 
were measured by integrating from 90 –100 °C to ca. 260 °C with a linear baseline. The percent 616 
crystallinity was calculated using the TRIOS software package. The glass transition temperatures of 617 
the PET films were measured using the second heating scan: 30–300 °C at 10 °C/min, held at 300 °C 618 
for one minute, then 300–40 °C at –10 °C/min. The glass transition temperatures for all the PET films 619 
were between 80–82 °C.  620

Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC)  621 
GPC measurement was performed at an on an Agilent system with a 1260 Infinity isocratic pump, 622 
degasser, and thermostated  column chamber held at 30 °C. A mixture of chloroform with 50 ppm 623 
amylene and 1,1,1,3,3,3 -hexafluoro-2-propanol (2.0 vol%) was used as the mobile phase at 0.5 624 
mL/min. Molecular weights (Mn, Mw) and polydispersity indices (Ð) were determined relative to 625 
polystyrene standards.  626 
Sample preparation for GPC:  627 
About 8 mg of PET was dissolved in 0.15 mL 1,1,1,3,3,3 -hexafluoro-2-propanol. Once PET was 628 
completely dissolved, chloroform was added to make a total volume of 2.50 mL. The solution was 629 
filtered through a PTFE membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm. 100 μL of the sample solution was 630 
then injected into the GPC system.  631 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 632 
PET films were mounted onto a 3.2 mm SEM stub using carbon tape. Samples were sputter -coated 633 
with 8 nm platinum/palladium using a Cressington 208HR Sputter Coater. The metal was sputter 634 
coated onto the sample via plasma generated with argon present in the chamber. SEM imaging was 635 
performed under vacuum using a Zeiss Supra40 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The electron 636 
beam intensity was 5 kV. 637 
Atomic force Microscopy (AFM)  638 
AFM was performed on an Aylum MFP -3D atomic force microscope (Asylum Research, Sa nta 639 
Barbara, CA) in tapping mode. Images were recorded after a surface scan on an area of 50×50 μm. 640 
Image analysis including histogram, and surface roughness was performed using Igor Pro. 641

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 643 
1H NMR spectroscopy w as performed at a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE NEO spectrometer at room 644 
temperature in CDCl3 or d6-DMSO. Chemical shift was referenced to the residual solvent signal ( 1H 645 
NMR: 7.26 ppm in CDCl3, 2.50 ppm in d6-DMSO, respectively). 646 
Microscopic observation of P. putida Go19 and PHAs 647 
PHAs formation in P. putida Go19 from the simultaneous experiment was microscopically observed 648 
by using an upright laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM -510, Zeiss) under reflectance using a 649 
100X, 1.3 NA oil -dipping objective (Zeiss), a ccording to the protocol described by Franden et al.28. 650 
0.5 mL sample was taken from the simultaneous process experiment of the P. putida Go19 culture 651 
(with 200 nM of FAST-PETase) that grew on NL-M9 medium supplemented with a circular pc-PET 652 
film (cookie container) as the sole carbon source. Culture was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 3 min, 653 
followed by washing twice with DPBS. Cell pellets were then stained with 1 mL of 10 μg/mL Nile 654 
Red (Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and kept in the dark for 30 min at room 655 
temperature. Subsequently, the stained cells were pelleted again by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 3 min, 656 
followed by washing twice with DPBS. Finally, the stained cells were resuspended in 200 μL of DPBS. 657 
1 ul of the stained cell solution was dipped on a coverslip and pressed with a small coverslip.  The 658 
samples were illuminated with a 561 nm laser and reflected light was collected by setting the Meta 659 
detector channel between 570-670 nm wavelength. 660

Legends for Supplementary Information Figures  702 
Supplementary Information  Fig. 1 | Schematic diagram of Mutcompute. a. Creating a 703 
microenvironment: MutCompute begins by centering itself on the alpha carbon of a particular residue 704 
in the protein and filters all peptide atoms within a 20 angstrom cube (the orientation of the cube is 705 
normalized with respect to the protein backbone). In the filtering process, we create an artificial, self-706 
supervised label by excluding all atoms that belong the center residue. b. Encoding the 707 
microenvironment: The filtered atoms are then encoded into a 7-channel voxelated representation with 708 
a voxel resolution of 1A3.  c. Running MutCompute on a Microenvironment: The 7-channel voxelated 709 
representation of a microenvironment is then passed to the CNN model, MutCompute. The model can 710 
be broken into 2 parts: Feature extraction and classification. The feature extraction portion c onsist of 711 
convolutional and max pooling layers and is then flattened into a 1D-vector before being passed to the 712 
classification layers of the model. The output is a probability mass function of the likelihood each of 713 
the 20 amino acids was the amino acid in the center of the microenvironment. We do this process for 714 
every residue in the protein to identify residues for mutagenesis. 715 
 716 
Supplementary Information Fig. 2 | Disfavored PETase residues flagged by MutCompute from 717 
the wild -type and ThermoPETase crystal  structures. MutCompute outputs a probability 718 
distribution that describes the likelihood of each of the 20 canonical amino acids to be the wild -type 719 
amino acid for the surrounding chemical environment. A disfavored residue is defined as a residue 720 
where the amino acid with the highest predicted probability is not the wild -type amino acid. Here, a 721 
30% wild-type probability cutoff was used to down select disfavored residues.  722
