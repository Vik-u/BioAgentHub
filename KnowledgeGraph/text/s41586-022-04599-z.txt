Plastic waste poses an ecological challenge1–3 and enzymatic degradation offers one, 
potentially green and scalable, route for polyesters waste recycling4. Poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET) accounts for 12% of global solid waste5, and a circular carbon 
economy for PET is theoretically attainable through rapid enzymatic 
depolymerization followed by repolymerization or conversion/valorization into 
other products6–10. Application of PET hydrolases, however, has been hampered by 
their lack of robustness to pH and temperature ranges, slow reaction rates and 
inability to directly use untreated postconsumer plastics
11. Here, we use a 
structure-based, machine learning algorithm to engineer a robust and active PET 
hydrolase. Our mutant and scaffold combination (FAST-PETase: functional, active, 
stable and tolerant PETase) contains five mutations compared to wild-type PETase 
(N233K/R224Q/S121E from prediction and D186H/R280A from scaffold) and shows 
superior PET-hydrolytic activity relative to both wild-type and engineered 
alternatives12 between 30 and 50 °C and a range of pH levels. We demonstrate that 
untreated, postconsumer-PET from 51 different thermoformed products can all be 
almost completely degraded by FAST-PETase in 1 week. FAST-PETase can also 
depolymerize untreated, amorphous portions of a commercial water bottle and an 
entire thermally pretreated water bottle at 50 ºC. Finally, we demonstrate a 
closed-loop PET recycling process by using FAST-PETase and resynthesizing PET from 
the recovered monomers. Collectively, our results demonstrate a viable route for 
enzymatic plastic recycling at the industrial scale.
Enzymatic depolymerization of PET was first reported in 2005 and 
has been nascently demonstrated using 19 distinct PET-hydrolysing 
enzymes (PHEs) derived from esterases, lipases and cutinases4,11,13. How-
ever, most of these enzymes only show appreciable hydrolytic activity 
at high reaction temperatures (that is, at or exceeding the PET glass 
transition temperature of roughly 70 ºC) and with highly processed 
substrates. For example, an engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase 
(LCC) can degrade 90% of pretreated postconsumer-PET (pc-PET) in 
10 h at 72 ºC and a pH of 8.0 (ref. 12). Most other PHEs similarly show poor 
activity at moderate temperatures14 and more neutral pH conditions15, 
greatly restricting in situ/microbially enabled degradation solutions for 
PET waste. This limitation is of critical concern as 40% of plastic waste 
bypasses collection systems and resides in natural environments16.  
In addition, converting untreated postconsumer plastic waste at near 
ambient temperatures would lower net operating costs.
Although the PHE from the PET-assimilating bacterium Ideonella 
sakaiensis14 (PETase) can operate at ambient conditions, it is highly 
labile and loses activity even at 37 ºC after 24 h (ref. 17). Nonetheless, 
this mesophilic enzyme has previously seen attempts to enhance ther-
mostability, robustness and function17–23. The most notable engineered 
PETase variants—ThermoPETase17 and DuraPETase22—were created 
through rational protein engineering and computational redesign 
strategies, respectively. Although the thermostability and catalytic 
activity of these two mutants were improved17,22 under certain con-
ditions, they nonetheless had overall lower PET-hydrolytic activity  
at mild temperatures.
We posited that highly focused protein engineering approaches can-
not consider the evolutionary trade-off between overall stability and 
activity, and that a neutral, structure-based, deep learning neural net-
work could generally improve enzyme function. T o this end, we used a 
three-dimensional (3D) self-supervised, convolutional neural network 
(CNN), MutCompute24 (https://mutcompute.com; Supplementary Fig. 1 
and Supplementary Discussion) to identify stabilizing mutations. This 
algorithm learns the local chemical microenvironments of amino acids 
on the basis of training over 19,000 sequence-balanced protein struc-
tures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and can readily predict positions 
within a protein in which wild-type (WT) amino acids are not optimized 
for their local environments. We used MutCompute to obtain a discrete 
probability distribution for the structural fit of all 20 canonical amino 
acids at every position in both WT PETase and ThermoPETase (crystal

reflecting the chemical congruency (shown in red, disfavoured and blue, favoured) 
with the neighbouring chemical microenvironments. Local microenvironments 
near the active site and major disfavoured amino acid residues (S121, T140, R224, 
N233) are shown as magnified panels and highlighted as pink sticks. Active site 
residues are shown as orange sticks. b, Predictions based on both WT PETase and 
ThermoPETase were ranked by the fold change in the probabilities between the 
predicted and the WT amino acid. 159 variants were generated by incorporating 
single or several predicted mutations into various PETase scaffolds to result in four 
mutations (S121E, T140D, R224Q and N233K) with the highest improvements both 
singly and in combination. These mutations were combinatorially assembled 
across three PETase scaffolds: WT PETase (WT), ThermoPETase (Thermo) and 
DuraPETase (Dura). c, The red heatmap (left) shows the PET-hydrolytic activity of 
the resulting variants and the blue heatmap (right) shows the fold change of activity 
over their respective scaffolds on the basis of total PET monomers (the sum of TPA 
and MHET) released from hydrolysing circular gf-PET film (6 mm in diameter, 
roughly 11.4 mg) by the PETase variants after 96 h of incubation at temperature 
ranging from 30 to 60 ºC. All measurements were conducted in triplicate (n = 3), and 
the mean values were used for generating the heatmaps. d, Predicted mutations

structures, PDB 5XJH and 6IJ6) (Supplementary Table 1), essentially car-
rying out an in silico comprehensive mutagenesis scan. The predicted 
distributions were rendered onto the protein crystal structure (Fig. 1a) 
to identify positions where WT amino acid residues fitted less well than 
potential substitutions. Predictions were then ranked by predicted 
probabilities (fold change of fit) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Sup-
plementary Table 2). Using a stepwise combination strategy, a total 
of 159 single or several predicted mutations were generated. Variants 
showing improved catalytic activity (as measured by esterase activity 
and plastic degradation rates) and thermostability (as measured by pro-
tein melting temperature, Tm) were characterized further. Among this 
set, four mutations (S121E, T140D, R224Q and N233K) (Fig. 1b) resulted 
in the highest improvements, both singly and in combination, and were 
selected for further assembly and analysis (see Supplementary Discus-
sion for further discussion of mutant down-select).
We assembled all 29 possible combinations using these four muta-
tions across three PETase scaffolds (WT PETase, ThermoPETase and 
DuraPETase). Of note, two could not be purified using the DuraPETase 
background after several attempts. Thermostability analysis of the 
remaining 27 mutants indicated that 23 (roughly 85%) resulted in ele-
vated Tm relative to their respective scaffolds (Extended Data Fig. 2). 
The highest change in thermostability from their respective PETase 
scaffolds were observed for variants PETaseT140D/N233K with a Tm of 58.1 ºC 
(ΔTm = 10 ºC from WT PETase), ThermoPETaseN233K with a Tm of 67.2 ºC 
(ΔTm = 9 ºC from ThermoPETase) and DuraPETase N233K with a Tm of 
83.5 ºC (ΔTm = 5 ºC from DuraPETase). The last mutant represents the 
most thermostable PETase mutant reported so far. It was noted that the 
protein yield of all 27 variants was improved (up to 3.8-fold increase) 
compared with the parental scaffold, further underscoring the ability 
of MutCompute to identify mutants of higher stability.
Next, we sought to evaluate the PET-hydrolytic activity of these more 
stable variants across a range of temperatures from 30 to 60 ºC using an 
amorphous PET film (gf-PET, from the supplier Goodfellow) commonly 
used in the literature12. This comparison immediately revealed that the 
machine learning guided predictions greatly enhanced activity and 
extended the working temperature range across all scaffolds (Fig. 1c). 
In particular, PETaseS121E/R224Q/N233K  demonstrated a 3.4- and 29-fold 
increase in PET-hydrolytic activity at 30 and 40 ºC, respectively, over 
WT PETase (Fig. 1c) at these same temperatures. Enzyme mutants based 
on the ThermoPETase scaffold showed an extended range of working 
temperature (30–60 °C) and showed substantially higher activity than 
their counterparts. Within this set, the best variant (containing N233K 
and R224Q on top of S121E), named FAST-PETase (functional, active, 
stable and tolerant PETase), showed 2.4- and 38-fold higher activity at 
40 and 50 °C, respectively, compared to ThermoPETase alone (Fig. 1c). 
At 50 °C, FAST-PETase showed the highest overall degradation of all 
mutants and temperatures tested here releasing 33.8 mM of PET mono-
mers (the sum of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (MHET)) in 96 h (Fig. 1c). The DuraPETase scaffold, in 
general, showed relatively low activity at mild temperatures (30–50 °C), 
but mutant-based improvements were realized at higher tempera-
tures (55–60 °C) as demonstrated by the most thermostable PETase 
mutant- DuraPETaseN233K (Fig. 1c). T o fully evaluate the catalytic resil-
ience of mutant enzymes to environmental conditions, FAST-PETase  
(PETaseS121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A) was compared to previously reported 
WT and mutant PHEs including WT PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, 
LCC and the most active mutant LCCF243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM)12 using 
amorphous gf-PET across a range of pH (6.5–8.0) and temperatures  
(30–40 °C) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Across these conditions, FAST-PETase 
emerged as an excellent candidate for mild temperatures and moderate 
pH conditions characteristic of in situ PET degradation.
Crystal structure analysis of FAST-PETase (PDB 7SH6; Extended 
Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1) at 1.44 Å resolution explains the 
enhanced stability through newly formed, favourable residue interac-
tions (Fig. 1d). The N233K mutation places a positively charged lysine 
next to E204 and establishes an intramolecular salt bridge (Fig. 1d(vi)). 
The side chain of R224, when mutated to glutamine, forms a hydrogen 
bond to the carbonyl group of S192 (Fig. 1d(iv)). Finally, the S121E muta-
tion enables a new water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network with 
H186 and N172 (Fig. 1d(ii)).
Next, we sought to investigate the portability and generalizability 
of the machine learning-based predictions using alternative PHEs.  
T o this end, we selected the N233K mutation and introduced this cor-
responding lysine mutation to LCC, ICCM and the cutinase-like enzyme, 
Cut190, from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 (ref. 25) (Extended 
Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). The resulting lysine mutation 
variants of Cut190 and LCC (LCCD238K and Cut190D250K) both showed 
substantially enhanced thermostability (ΔTm = 7 ºC) relative to their 
respective scaffolds (Fig. 2a) whereas the lysine mutation variant of 
ICCM (ICCMC238K/C283S) demonstrated a Tm of 96.3 ºC, a decrease of 3.7 ºC. 
More importantly, the hydrolytic activity of all three of these lysine 
mutation variants on amorphous gf-PET were notably higher than their 
respective scaffolds (Fig. 2b), thus showcasing mutations portability.
Beyond model plastic substrates, it is critical to demonstrate the 
performance of PETase enzymes on raw, untreated pc-PET. Notably, 
unlike the gf-PET used above and throughout the literature, there is no

singular pc-PET substrate. T o this end, we collected 51 samples of post-
consumer plastic products used in the packaging of food, beverages, 
medications, office supplies, household goods and cosmetics available 
at local grocery store chains and treated this raw material enzymati-
cally with FAST-PETase at 50 ºC (Supplementary Table 3). Despite their 
heterogeneity across crystallinity, molecular weight, thickness and 
additives, hole-punched samples from this wide array of PET products 
were all fully degraded by FAST-PETase in 1 week and in as little as 24 h 
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). 
The depolymerization (as measured by monomers generation) by 
FAST-PETase occurred at an almost linear rate (Supplementary Fig. 4), 
accompanied by a corresponding linear mass loss of the films (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). Although degradation time did correlate with the thick-
ness of the plastic (as thickness and mass are related) (Extended Data 
Fig. 6), no other singular, measured trait of these thermoformed, low 
crystalline PET determined degradation rates (Extended Data Fig. 7).
A time-course analysis (Fig. 3b) from a bean cake container revealed 
the almost linear decay rate and concomitant increase in crystallin-
ity from 1.2 to 7.7% over 16 h (Supplementary Fig. 6). Atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3c) as well as scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) (Extended Data Fig. 8) further depict the reaction progression 
of FAST-PETase as it produced increasingly deeper and larger holes in 
the pc-PET surface resulting in increased surface roughness (and visible 
opaqueness) over the course of the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 7). 
By contrast, the PET-hydrolytic activity of WT PETase, ThermoPETase, 
DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM towards this pc-PET was substantially lower 
(3.2- to 141.6-fold) than that of FAST-PETase under the same condi-
tions (Fig. 3b). The activity of LCC and ICCM even at their previously 
reported optimal reaction temperature of 72 °C (ref. 12) was still 4.9- and 
1.5-fold lower, respectively, than that of FAST-PETase at 50 °C. Further 
experimental analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8) indicated that LCC and 
ICCM showed their highest degradation rate against this pc-PET film at 
60 °C, yet this activity was still lower than that of FAST-PETase at 50 °C. 
We also demonstrate that this FAST-PETase-enabled depolymerization 
is easily scalable to large, untreated pieces of plastic (in this case, 6.4 g 
rather than 11 mg) simply by increasing net reaction volumes (Fig. 3d).
We next sought to investigate whether commercial PET water bot-
tles can be enzymatically hydrolysed by FAST-PETase. Different from 
the thermoformed postconsumer plastic products, water bottles are 
produced by blow-moulding, which makes most of the bottle highly 
crystalline (>25% crystallinity) resulting from the expansion process26. 
Highly crystalline polymers are less susceptible to enzymatic attacks and 
even the growth of I. sakaiensis is restricted to low crystalline regions of 
water bottles27. T o more fully evaluate enzymatic depolymerization of

as Mn = 16.4 kg mol
−1, Mw = 45.9 kg mol−1, Ð = 2.80 by GPC. KH 2PO4-NaOH (pH 8) 
buffer was used for all enzymes shown in this figure. All measurements ( a–e) 
were conducted in triplicate ( n = 3). The bars and circles shown represent the

commercial water bottles, we determined the crystallinity of various 
sections of the bottle and find that the finish/neck and base centre are 
relatively amorphous (1.2 and 11.7% crystallinity) whereas the rest of the 
bottle is highly crystalline (25.9 to 33.8% crystallinity) (Fig. 4a). T o evalu-
ate biodegradability of raw, untreated sections of a water bottle, we cut 
out or hole-punched fragments from these regions and treated them with 
FAST-PETase at 50 °C for 24 h. Our results (Fig. 4b) show that substan-
tial monomers release was achieved at the finish/neck and base centre 
region whereas only trace amounts of monomers (0.09 to 0.14 mM) were 
released for the rest of the bottle, thus indicating that high crystallinity 
negatively affects the enzymatic depolymerization rate.
PET polymer chains become more motile and flexible at a temperature 
close to the glass transition temperature (roughly 70 °C)28. Therefore, 
it has been proposed that conducting enzymatic depolymerization at 
higher temperatures could improve degradation susceptibility and 
rate29. T o investigate this hypothesis, we compared the hydrolytic activ-
ity of FAST-PETase with other PHEs, including the thermophilic enzymes 
LCC and ICCM across a range of temperatures from 50 to 72 °C. These 
results demonstrated that the highly crystalline body part still cannot 
be efficiently depolymerized by any tested enzymes and temperatures 
and that FAST-PETase at 50 °C exhibited the highest overall depolymeri-
zation rate (Extended Data Fig. 9). T o tackle the challenge of complete 
water bottle degradation, we used a simple thermal pretreatment. By 
melting the whole bottle followed by a quick temperature quenching, 
the bottle PET became uniformly amorphous (roughly 2% crystallin-
ity). By using hole-punched films from this pretreated bottle, we com-
pared the hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase along with other PHEs, 
across temperatures from 50 to 72 °C (Fig. 4c). These results indicate 
that FAST-PETase can efficiently depolymerize pretreated bottle films, 
releasing 32.8 mM of PET monomers at 50 °C in 24 h, which is the highest 
of among all PHEs and temperature combinations tested. At the same 
time, a slightly modified thermal pretreatment process produced a more 
highly crystalline (23.6%) film. Albeit slightly harder to depolymerize 
compared to the amorphous counterpart, FAST-PETase was still able 
to depolymerize these films releasing 23.8 mM of PET monomers at 
50 °C in 24 h. Finally, we demonstrate that the complete, non-physically 
disrupted melted plastic puck from an entire water bottle (roughly 9 g) 
can be essentially completely degraded by FAST-PETase at 50 °C in less 
than 2 weeks (Fig. 4d).
Beyond packaging materials, PET is used heavily in the synthetic 
textile industry. T o this end, we evaluated the potential application of 
FAST-PETase to partially degrade commercial polyester products. Five 
different commercial polyester products were treated with FAST-PETase 
at 50 °C, releasing higher amounts of PET monomers relative to that 
of the samples treated with other PHEs (Fig. 4e). This indicates that 
FAST-PETase can potentially be used for rapid and efficient degradation 
of the PET fragments embedded in textile fabrics, providing a potential 
route for recovering PET monomers from commercial polyester prod-
ucts and reducing the leaching of microfibers into the environment.
Given the high activity of this FAST-PETase mutant at ambient tem-
peratures and pH conditions, we proposed that this enzyme would be 
suitable for an enzymatic-chemical processing of PET. In this regard, 
PET depolymerization is only half of the circular plastic economy and 
we demonstrate here a closed-cycle PET reconstitution by first depo-
lymerizing tinted postconsumer plastic waste using FAST-PETase and 
subsequently recovering monomers and repolymerizing into virgin 
PET. TPA was recovered from the degradation solution with a yield of 
94.9% and with a purity of over 97% (Supplementary Figs. 9–11). We then 
regenerate virgin PET directly from the degradation solution using 
chemical polymerization (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12). A com-
plete cycle of degradation to repolymerization can be accomplished 
in as little as a few days (Supplementary Fig. 13) and demonstrates the 
feasibility of a closed-loop enzymatic/chemical recycling process to 
generate a clear, virgin PET film from non-petroleum resources. Moreo-
ver, this workflow bypasses the challenges of recycling mixed-colour 
PET products. Collectively, these results demonstrate the application 
of structure-based machine learning for converting mesophilic enzyme 
scaffolds into broad-range biocatalysts for a cyclic plastic economy.

Methods
CNN model
MutCompute24 is a three-dimensional CNN (3DCNN) model in which 
the architecture consists of nine layers divided into two blocks:  
(1) feature extraction and (2) classification. The feature extraction block 
consisted of six layers: two pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by 
a dimension reduction max pooling layer after each pair. The first pair 
of convolutional layers used filters of size 3 × 3 × 3 and the second pair 
had filters of size 2 × 2 × 2. For the first pair, the convolutional layers had 
100 and 200 filters and for the second pair, the convolutional layers 
had 200 and 400 filters. Furthermore, the rectified linearity unit func-
tion (Relu) was applied to the output of the four convolutional layers. 
The final feature maps generated by the feature extraction block had 
dimensions of size 400 × 3 × 3 × 3. These feature maps were flattened 
into a one-dimensional vector of size 10,800 before being passed to 
the classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully 
connected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2 and 0, respec-
tively. Like the feature extraction block, the output of the first two dense 
layers was transformed by the Relu function. T o obtain a vector of 20 
probability scores representing the network prediction for each of the 
amino acids, we applied a softmax activation function to the output of 
the third dense layer. MutCompute is available as a machine learning 
as a service on https://mutcompute.com.
MutCompute predictions
MutCompute predictions were obtained by running the WT PETase 
(PDB ID 5XJH) and ThermoPETase (PDB ID 6IJ6) through our machine 
learning as a service at https://mutcompute.com. Residues were filtered 
by sorting by the probability assigned to the WT amino acid. We filtered 
34 and 39 residues from the WT PETase and ThermoPETase crystal struc-
tures, respectively. From these filtered residues, we assigned priority 
to our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the ten residues from 
each crystal structure with the highest log2 fold change between the 
predicted amino acid and WT amino acid probabilities. Before experi-
mentation, selected residues were visualized with MutCompute-View, 
which is built on top of NGL Viewer (https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl), 
to ensure three things: (1) the prediction was chemically sound and 
not because of a crystal or model artefact, (2) we were avoiding the 
active site and binding pocket and (3) avoiding epistatic interactions 
between predictions and instead targeting predicted ‘instability hot-
spots’ . MutCompute-View has been made publicly available at https://
mutcompute.com/view.
Protein crystallization, X-ray diffraction data collection, data 
processing and model refinement
T o identify crystallization conditions for FAST-PETase, a sample con-
taining 6 mg ml−1 purified FAST-PETase was screened in sparse-matrix 
screening using Phoenix robotic system (Art Robinson). The initial hits 
were identified with the rod-shaped crystals formed after incubating 
screening plates at 25 °C for 3 days. The crystallization was optimized 
as 0.1 M bis-TRIS, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH 5.5 setup as sitting-drop 
vapour diffusion.
Individual FAST-PETase crystals were flash-frozen directly in liquid 
nitrogen after cryoprotected with 30% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction 
data were collected at the 23-ID-B beamline in the Advance Photon 
Source. The X-ray diffraction pattern was processed to 1.44 Å resolution 
for FAST-PETase crystals using HKL2000 (ref. 30). The structure was 
solved by molecular replacement with ThermoPETase structure as the 
initial search model (PDB code 6IJ6, ref. 17). The molecular replacement 
solution for FAST-PETase structure was iteratively built and refined 
using Coot31 and the Phenix32 refinement package. Procheck and Mol-
Probity evaluated the quality of the finalized FAST-PETase structure. 
The final statistics for data collection and structural determination 
are shown in Extended Data Table 1.
Cloning
Genes encoding I. sakaiensis 201-F6 IsPETase (WT PETase) (accession 
number: A0A0K8P6T7), its mutants—PETase S121E/D186H/R280A  (Ther -
moPETase17) and PETaseS214H/I168R/W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/T140D 
(DuraPETase22), cutinase-like enzyme, from S. AHK190 (ref. 25) (Cut190) 
(accession number: BAO42836), LCC (accession number: G9BY57) 
and its mutant LCCF243I/D238C/S283C/N246M (ICCM)12—were commercially 
synthesized for cloning. T o enable extracellular expression of PETase 
and its mutants in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (ATCC 47054), the 
nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide SPpstu (21 amino acids) from 
maltotetraose-forming amylase of Pseudomonas stutzeri MO-19 (ref. 33)  
was used to substitute the original signal peptide sequence (first 27 
amino acids) of WT PETase. The WT PETase and its mutants’ genes 
with SPpstu presented at the N terminus were amplified by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) using the synthetic genes as a template. Subse-
quently, using the Gibson Assembly method, DNA fragments encoding 
WT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were subcloned into a 
modified pBTK552 vector34 in which the antibiotic resistance marker 
was swapped from spectinomycin to kanamycin resistance gene and a 
C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence was added. T o enable 
intracellular expression of Cut190, LCC and ICCM in Escherichia coli 
(DE3) (New England Biolabs), the nucleotide sequence encoding the 
original signal peptide was removed from the synthetic genes. The 
Cut190, LCC and ICCM genes without signal peptide sequence were 
amplified by PCR using the synthetic genes as a template. Subsequently, 
using Gibson Assembly method, the DNA fragments encoding Cut190, 
LCC and ICCM were subcloned into a commercial vector-pET -21b (Nova-
gen), which carries a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag-coding sequence. 
The electrocompetent cell E. coli DH10β was transformed with the 
Gibson Assembly product by following a standard electroporation 
protocol. The resultant expression plasmid DNA was extracted from 
the overnight culture of the cloning host by using the QIAprep Spin 
Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The DNA sequence of the extracted plasmid 
was verified by Sanger sequencing. A list of nucleotide sequences and 
expressed amino acid sequences of the genes used in the study is pro-
vided in Supplementary Methods.
Variant construction
Variants of WT PETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase were generated 
through site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR method described in 
the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit E0552S (New England Biolabs). 
The constructed plasmids carrying WT PETase, ThermoPETase and 
DuraPETase genes were used as the templates for mutagenesis PCR 
reaction. The corresponding primer sequences and annealing tem-
perature were designed and generated by using the NEBaseChanger 
tool. Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech Laboratories) were used as 
the cloning host and transformed with the ligated plasmids using the 
heat-shock method provided in the manufacturer’s instructions. Plas-
mid extraction and sequencing for the variants were performed under 
the same conditions as described for plasmids carrying WT PETase, 
ThermoPETase and DuraPETase genes.
Protein expression and purification
For extracellular protein expression of WT PETase, ThermoPETase, 
DuraPETase and their variants, P . putida KT2440 was used as the expres-
sion host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed with the cor-
responding constructed plasmids. For intracellular protein expression 
of Cut190, LCC, ICCM and their variants, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used as 
the expression host and its electrocompetent cell was transformed 
with the corresponding constructed plasmids. A single colony of an  
P . putida KT2440 or E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain harbouring one of the con-
structed plasmids was inoculated into 2 ml of Luria Bertani medium 
with 50 µg ml−1 kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C/225 r.p.m. The 
overnight-grown culture (using 150 µl) was scaled up with 1,000-fold 
dilution in a 500-ml triple baffled shake flask and grown to a cell density 
of 0.8 (optical density (OD600)) at 37 °C/225 r.p.m. Protein expression was 
induced by adding 0.2 mM of isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside 
and cells were cultured for 24 h at 30 °C/225 r.p.m. For isolation of the 
extracellularly expressed PETase enzymes, the induced cell culture was 
centrifuged at 14,000g and 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the supernatant 
that accommodates secretory protein. For isolation of the intracellularly 
expressed Cut190, LCC and ICCM, the induced cell culture was collected 
by centrifugation at 4,000g and 4 °C for 20 min. Cell pellets were then 
resuspended in 25 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) pH 7.0 buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, 
1 g l−1 lysozyme and 5 µl of Pierce Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), followed by mixing on a rocker for 20 min at 4 °C. Subse-
quently, cells were lysed by sonication and the resulting cell lysate was 
centrifuged at 14,000g and 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the supernatant 
that contains soluble proteins. Target proteins from the above two types 
of supernatant were both purified by HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Desalt-
ing of the protein eluent was carried out by using Sephadex G-25 PD-10 
columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
All purification and desalting steps were performed at 4 °C in a cold 
room. Afterwards, the purified protein was concentrated to a final vol-
ume of 1 ml by the 50 ml, 10-kDa cut-off Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter 
device (EMD Millipore Corporation) and preserved in DPBS (pH 7.0). 
The protein concentration was then determined by using the Coomas-
sie Plus Bradford Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Infinite 
M200 PRO microplate reader (T ecan) to measure the absorbance of 
assay mixtures. The presence and purity of the purified proteins were 
assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
In vitro analysis of PET-hydrolytic activity using commercial 
Goodfellow PET film (gf-PET)
T o evaluate the PET-hydrolytic activity of PETase and its variants, 
the homogenous amorphous gf-PET film (Goodfellow, US 577-529-
50; specification: 1.3–1.4 g cm−3 density, 1.58–1.64 refractive index, 
100 × 10 −13 cm3. cm cm −2 s−1 Pa−1 permeability to water at 25 °C, 
20–80 × 0−6 K−1 coefficient of thermal expansion, 0.13–0.15 W m−1 K−1 
at 23 °C thermal conductivity) was used as the substrate for degradation 
assays with the purified PETase enzyme and its variants. The gf-PET film 
was prepared in a circular form (6 mm in diameter, roughly 11.4 mg) and 
was washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol and deionized water 
before usage. Subsequently, the gf-PET film was put into a glass test 
tube and fully submerged in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer 
(pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. The test tube was tightly capped 
and wrapped with parafilm to minimize volatilization. The reaction 
mixture was then incubated at 30, 40, 50, 55 and 60 °C for 96 h. Fol-
lowed by removing the enzyme-treated gf-PET film from the reaction 
mixture, the enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 85 °C for 
20 min. The reaction mixture samples were then centrifuged at 10,000g 
for 5 min. The supernatant of each sample was further analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantifying PET 
monomers released from the PET depolymerization.
T o compare the PET-hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase with WT PETase, 
ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM across a range of pH (6.5–8.0) 
at 30 and 40 °C, a similar experimental setup was used. The circular 
gf-PET film (6 mm diameter, roughly 11.4 mg) was used as the substrate. 
The enzyme reactions were performed with 200 nM purified enzyme in 
600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer with various pH values (6.5, 7.0, 
7.5 or 8.0) at 30 and 40 °C. After incubating the enzyme reaction for 96 h, 
the supernatant of the reaction mixture was also analysed by HPLC for 
quantifying PET monomers released from the PET depolymerization.
Depolymerization of pc-PET plastics
Hole-punched pc-PET films (6 mm in diameter) from 51 postconsumer 
plastic products were serially treated by 200 nM FAST-PETase in 600 µl 
of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. Fresh enzyme solu-
tion was replenished every 22 h to maximize enzymatic depolym -
erization rate for degrading the 51 samples of various pc-PET films.  
The supernatant of the enzymatic hydrolysate of the PET samples was 
analysed by HPLC for quantifying PET monomers released throughout 
the whole depolymerization process.
The time-course analysis of degrading a pc-PET film (Bean cake con-
tainer) by various PHEs was conducted at 50 °C. The reactions were 
performed with 200 nM enzyme in 600 µl of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH 
buffer (pH 8.0) and terminated at 6, 12, 18 or 24 h for quantifying total 
PET monomers released at each time point.
A large, untreated and transparent pc-PET (Bean cake container, 
roughly 6.4 g) was treated by 200 nM of FAST-PETase in 100 mM of 
KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. The whole piece of transpar-
ent PET container was fully submerged in 2.5 l of enzyme solution and 
completely degraded after 48 h.
Depolymerization of an untreated water bottle
T o depolymerize an untreated water bottle, fragments were cut out or 
hole-punched from various sections (finish/neck, shoulder, body, tran-
sition to base, base, base centre) of an untreated water bottle (500 ml, 
CG Roxane LLC.). The fragments were fully submerged in 600 µl of 
100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. 
The depolymerization was conducted at 50, 60 and 72 °C for 24 h.
PET water bottle thermal pretreatment
PET water bottles (500 ml, CG Roxane LLC.) were heated at 290 °C 
on a hot plate covered with aluminium foil. Once PET was melted 
(about 1 min), another piece of aluminium foil was placed on top 
of the melted PET. A stainless-steel cylinder (diameter 6 cm, weight 
616 g) was used to press the melted PET into a film with a flat surface. 
After pressing for 1 min, the stainless-steel cylinder was lifted and 
the PET film was heated again at 290 °C for 15 min. After heating, the 
hot PET films covered with the aluminium foil was rapidly cooled in 
an ice bath. After cooling, the reprocessed PET films were peeled off 
from the aluminium foil.
Meanwhile, a treated but more highly crystalline film can also be 
produced through a slight modification (after pressing the melted PET 
films for 1 min by the cylinder, the films were directly quenched by an 
ice bath without the reheating step) of the above protocol.
Depolymerization of a pretreated water bottle
T o depolymerize pretreated water bottle films, circular films (6 mm 
in diameter; roughly 25 mg) were hole-punched from the pretreated 
water bottle and treated by 200 nM of various PHEs in 600 µl of 100 mM 
KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at temperatures ranging from 50 to 72 °C 
for 24 h.
T o completely depolymerize a pretreated whole water bottle), the 
melted plastic pucks from an entire water bottle (500 ml; roughly 
9 g, CG Roxane LLC.) were cut into small rectangular flakes (roughly 
1 × 3 cm). The resulting flakes were then fully submerged in 200 ml of 
enzyme solution that contained 200 nM of FAST-PETase in 100 mM 
KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0). Depolymerization was conducted at 
50 °C and fresh enzyme solution was replenished every 24 h to maxi-

Depolymerization of polyester products
Five different commercial polyester products were cut into small 
pieces and used as the substrates that were fully submerged in 600 µl 
of 100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 200 nM purified enzyme. 
Enzyme treatment on these five polyester products was conducted 
at 50 °C. After 24 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated. The 
enzyme degradation solution was used to determine how much PET 
monomers were released from hydrolysing these polyester products 
by various PHEs.

Depolymerization of large, untreated pc-PET container and 
regeneration of virgin PET
A large, untreated, and green coloured pc-PET container was cut into 
small rectangular flakes (roughly 1 × 3 cm). Then 3.0 g of the coloured 
pc-PET flakes was serially treated by 200 nM FAST-PETase in 100 mM 
KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) at 50 °C. 200 nM of fresh enzyme was 
added to the degradation solution every 24 h to maximize enzymatic 
degradation rate. All the coloured pc-PET fragments were completely 
degraded after 6 days.
On completion of degradation, the enzyme degradation solution was 
filtered and the filtrate was collected for regeneration. The pH of the 
filtrate was adjusted to pH 11 with NaOH to hydrolyse remaining MHET. 
The solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h to complete the 
hydrolysis. The pH of the solution was subsequently adjusted to 2 with 
37% HCl. The precipitate was filtered and washed several times with 
deionized water and dried under vacuum overnight. Then 4.3 g of TPA 
was collected and used in the next step without further purification. 
Settings used for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were 400 MHz, 
d6-DMSO: 8.03 ppm (s, 4H).
T o a suspension of TPA (4.31 g, 25.9 mmol) in CH3OH (150 ml), 95% H2SO4 
(2.0 ml) was added dropwise at room temperature. The mixture was 
stirred at reflux for 24 h and became a clear solution. The reaction mixture 
was then cooled to room temperature. Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) was 
subsequently recrystallized from the reaction mixture and collected after 
filtration. These white crystals were washed with cold CH3OH and dried 
under vacuum for 4 h to afford DMT (4.12 g) with a yield of 82%. 1H NMR 
(400 MHz, CDCl3): 8.08 ppm (s, 4H), 3.93 ppm (s, 6H).
T o a three-necked round bottom flask equipped with an air con-
denser, DMT (4.12 g, 21.1 mmol) was added. The flask was evacuated 
under vacuum and refilled with nitrogen gas for three times. Ethyl -
ene glycol (1.20 ml, 21.5 mmol) was added, followed by the addition of 
titanium isopropoxide (0.06 ml, 0.21 mmol). The mixture was stirred 
at 160 °C for 1 h, 200 °C for 1 h and 210 °C for 2 h under nitrogen.  
The reaction temperature was further increased to 260 °C, and high 
vacuum was applied to remove unreacted monomers. The mixture was 
stirred at 260 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The result-
ing PET was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, 10 ml) 
and added dropwise to CH3OH to remove the catalyst. PET (2.83 g) was 
collected as white solids after centrifuging and dried under vacuum.
Gravimetric determination of the degraded pc-PET film
The intact pc-PET film was washed three times with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol 
and deionized water followed by drying the samples under vacuum 
at 30 °C for 24 h before gravimetric measurement. After enzymatic 
treatment, the degraded pc-film followed the same washing and drying 
procedure before gravimetric measurement. The weights of the pc-PET 
film before and after enzyme treatment were compared to determine 
the weight loss of the degraded pc-PET film.
Analytical method for measuring PET monomers released
HPLC was used to analyse the PET monomers TPA and MHET released 
from PET depolymerization. The assay samples were filtered with 
0.2-µm nylon syringe filters (Wheaton Science) before running HPLC. 
Measurement of TPA and MHET was performed using a Dionex Ulti-
Mate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse 
Plus C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm2, 3.5 µm) with detection wavelength 
at 260 nm. Column oven was held at 30 °C with 1% acetic acid in water 
or 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase over the course of the 
30-min sequence under the following conditions: 1 to 5% organic (vol/
vol) for 5 min, 5 to 100% organic (vol/vol) for 8 min, 100% organic (vol/
vol) for 10 min and 100 to 5% organic for 2 min followed by 5% organic 
for 5 min. The flow rate was fixed at 0.8 ml min−1. A standard curve was 
prepared using commercial TPA with ≥99.0% purity (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) or MHET ≥97.0% purity (Advanced ChemBlocks Inc.).
Analytical method for measuring melting temperature (Tm) of 
proteins
T o evaluate the thermostability of WT PETase and its variants, differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine their respective Tm.  
Purified protein samples were concentrated to roughly 300–500 µM 
using Microcon Centrifugal Filter 10K Devices (Millipore). Then 10 µl 
of concentrated protein solution (DPBS buffer pH 7.0) was placed 
in an aluminium Tzero pan and sealed with a Tzero hermetic lid (TA 
Instruments). Tm of the protein samples was analysed by a DSC250 (TA 
Instruments) with a RCS90 electric chiller. Two DSC procedures were 
used depending on the anticipated denaturation temperature of the 
protein. The first DSC method heated from 40 to 90 °C at 10 °C min−1, 
held at 90 °C for 2 min, then cooled from 90 to 40 °C at −10 °C min−1. 
The second method heated from 20 to 70 °C at 10 °C min−1, held at 70 °C 
for 2 min and cooled from 70 to 40 °C at −10 °C min−1. The denaturation 
temperature of the proteins was measured on the heating ramp trace 
as the midpoint value at half-height.
Analytical method for determining PET film crystallinity
DSC was used to determine the percentage crystallinity of the PET 
films hole-punched from the postconsumer plastics. PET film samples 
(4–10.5 mg) were placed in aluminium Tzero pans with a Tzero solid 
sample lid. Samples were first heated from 40 to 300 °C at 5 °C min, 
held at 300 °C for 1 min, cooled from 300 to 30 °C at –5 °C min−1 and 
held at 30 °C for 1 min in a DSC250 (TA Instruments) with a RCS90 elec-
tric chiller. The percentage crystallinity was determined on the first 
heating scan using the enthalpies of melting and cold crystallization. 
The equation used to calculate percentage crystallinity within the PET 
film was the following
ΔH ΔH
ΔH%crystallinity = − ×1 00mc c
m




where ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting ( J g−1), ΔHcc is the enthalpy of cold 
crystallization ( J g−1), and ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting for a 100% 
crystalline PET sample, which is 140.1 J g−1 (refs. 12,22). ΔHm and ΔHcc were 
measured by integrating from 90–100 °C to roughly 260 °C with a linear 
baseline. The percentage crystallinity was calculated using the TRIOS 
software package. The glass transition temperatures of the PET films 
were measured using the second heating scan: 30–300 at 10 °C min
−1, 
held at 300 °C for 1 min and then 300–40 °C at −10 °C min−1. The glass 
transition temperatures for all the PET films were between 80 and 82 °C.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
GPC measurement was performed at an on an Agilent system with 
a 1260 Infinity isocratic pump, degasser and thermostated column 
chamber held at 30 °C. A mixture of chloroform with 50 ppm amylene 
and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (2.0 vol%) was used as the mobile 
phase at 0.5 ml min−1. Molecular weights (Mn, Mw) and polydispersity 
indices (Ð) were determined relative to polystyrene standards. For 
sample preparation for GPC, about 8 mg of PET was dissolved in 0.15 ml 
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Once PET was completely dissolved, 
chloroform was added to make a total volume of 2.50 ml. The solution 
was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with a pore 
size of 0.45 µm. Then 100 µl of the sample solution was injected into 
the GPC system.
SEM
PET films were mounted onto a 3.2-mm SEM stub using carbon tape. 
Samples were sputter coated with 8-nm platinum/palladium using 
a Cressington 208HR Sputter Coater. The metal was sputter coated 
onto the sample by means of plasma generated with argon present in 
the chamber. SEM imaging was performed under vacuum using a Zeiss 
Supra40 SEM. The electron beam intensity was 5 kV.
AFM
AFM was performed on an Aylum MFP-3D atomic force microscope 
(Asylum Research) in tapping mode. Images were recorded after a 
surface scan on an area of 50 × 50 µm2. Image analysis, including his-
tograms and surface roughness, was performed using Igor Pro.
NMR spectroscopy
1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE 
NEO spectrometer at room temperature in CDCl3 or d6-DMSO. Chemical 
shift was referenced to the residual solvent signal (1H NMR: 7.26 ppm 
in CDCl3, 2.50 ppm in d6-DMSO, respectively).

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Top 10 MutCompute predictions ranked by fold 
change in the probabilities between the predicted and the wild-type amino 
acid. The top 10 mutations predicted using the wild-type PETase ( a) and 
T her moPE Tase (b) as scaffolds are presented. MutCompute is an ensembled 
model that consist of three individually trained 3-dimensional convolutional 
neural network (3DCNN) models. Thus, the avg_log_ratio column is the average 
of the three log ratio values obtained from the three 3DCNN models, rather 
than being the log ratio of the average probability assigned to the wild type and 
predicted amino acid across the three 3DCNN models.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Time-course of mass loss and PET monomers 
released from hydrolyzing the hole-punched films of six representative 
pc-PET products with FAST-PETase.  The six pc-PET products represent PET 
#2, 6, 8, 25, 29, 32 that were randomly selected from the 51 pc-PET products 
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The pc-PET films 
hole-punched from these PET products were hydrolysed by serial treatment 
with FAST-PETase at 50 °C until the films were completely degraded (film 
disappeared). Enzyme solution (200 nM of FAST-PETase in 100 mM 
KH
2PO4-NaOH (pH 8.0) buffer) was replenished every 22 h. All measurements 
were conducted in triplicate (n = 3). The squares (mass loss) and circles (PET 
monomers released) shown represent the individual numbers. The line 
connects mean values of the timepoints.
Extended Data Fig. 6 | Scatterplot of time needed for complete degradation 
versus initial mass of the hole-punched films from 51 different pc-PET

plastic products.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Depolymerization of the Finish/Neck, Body and  
Base Center fragments of an untreated water bottle. Depolymerization was 
tested by FAST-PETase, wild-type PETase (WT), ThermoPETase (Thermo), 
DuraPETase (Dura), LCC and ICCM at (a) 50 ºC, (b) 60 ºC, and (c) 72 ºC. All 
measurements were conducted in triplicate (n = 3). The bars and circles shown 
for each enzyme represent the average and individual numbers, respectively. 
This comparative analysis provides two main conclusions. First, although 
higher reaction temperatures do promote the hydrolytic activity of the 
thermophilic LCC and ICCM against the amorphous parts of the bottle (base 
center and finish), the highly crystalline body part still cannot be efficiently 
depolymerized by any tested enzymes and temperatures. Second, FAST-PETase 
at 50 ºC exhibited the highest overall depolymerization rate seen in these 
experiments releasing 42, 0.14 and 15 mM of PET monomers within 24 h against 
the finish, body, and bottom center of the bottle respectively. These values are 
25%, 43% and 20% higher, respectively, than that of ICCM at 72 ºC.
