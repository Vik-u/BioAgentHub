Abstract 
Enzymatic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic degradation is a promising approach to 
combat the exploding plastic pollution.  EstS1, a pH-tolerant, thermostable esterase, has been 
previously recognized for its degradation potential against phthalate diester plasticizers. The 
present study elucidates the exceptional potential of this enzyme to degrade crystalline PET 
plastic and its primary intermediate, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), into 
terephthalate. Kinetic analyses revealed that EstS1 degrades 75% of BHET in 1h, liberating 
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and terephthalate as end products. The co-crystal 
structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET exhibited the electron density of BHET, MHET, and 
ethylene glycol, including MHET bound at the active site, in a canonical tetrahedral 
intermediate conformation. The complex structure of BHET with the Ser154Ala mutant of 
EstS1 further accommodated two BHET molecules, one interacting directly with the catalytic 
triad and the oxyanion hole. MD simulation analysis revealed highly stable interactions of 
BHET at the active site of EstS1. Moreover, SEM imaging displayed significant degradation of 
the crystalline PET plastic film by EstS1 esterase over a period of 15 days, both under 
controlled and soil-based fluctuating environmental conditions, highlighting its versatility to 
varying environmental conditions. XPS analysis discovered the increase in -C-O-, -C-N-, -N-H-
, and -N=O- bonds at the surface of EstS1-treated PET film, indicating effective degradation. 
Consequently, this comprehensive kinetic, structural, and morphology-based analysis of the 
PET-degrading potential of EstS1 esterase encourages further enzyme engineering studies to 
exploit the dual potential of EstS1 esterase to degrade both plastic and plasticizers.

1. Introduction  
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic production reached 28 million metric tons in 2024 and 
is expected to grow to 35 million metric tons by 2030. The consistent increase in the production 
of PET plastic and its accumulation in different ecosystems is threatening the survival and 
adaptability of ecosystems (Jovanovi
ć  et al., 2025). The micro-sized particles of PET plastics 
have also been identified in human tissues, including the brain, lungs, kidneys, heart, and 
placenta, from where they can pass to the fetus after crossing the placental barrier. The adverse 
effects of PET plastic accumulation inside the human body include disruption of the endocrine 
system, neuronal dysfunctions, heart strokes, renal toxicity, and developmental problems in the 
fetus (Enyoh et al., 2023; Sheriff et al., 2025). Although extensive efforts have been directed to 
reduce the generation of PET plastic waste and enhance recycling practices to alleviate the 
increasing plastic pollution, they are unable to meet the tons of plastic accumulated around the 
globe (Massoud & Dsilva, 2024). Further, the recalcitrant nature of crystalline PET plastic and 
the toxic residues released during chemical and physical processes limit the degradation of 
plastics. Biodegradation of PET plastic has been studied extensively using diverse microbial 
strains or their respective enzymes (Maurya et al., 2020).   
Serine hydrolases, which include cutinases, lipases, and esterases, are known to mediate the 
depolymerization of PET into bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), which is subsequently 
degraded into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). MHET is further converted into 
terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol, either by the same or another serine hydrolase 
(Chen et al., 2018) (Figure 1). These hydrolases contain a catalytic triad of the Ser-His-Asp/Glu 
that cleaves the ester bond found in PET or its degradation products using a ping-pong 
mechanism combined with tetrahedral covalent enzyme intermediates (Lai et al ., 2023). 
Thermostability is a highly desired characteristic for PET depolymerizing hydrolases due to the 
high glass transition temperature of PET, lying in the range of 70 to 80 °C (Zhang, 2022). 
Several thermostable PET-degrading hydrolases have been identified, including Ca PETase, 
PHL7, TfCut2, HiC cutinase, Cut190, Est119, and LCC (Hong et al., 2023; Richter et al., 2023; 
Mrigwani et al., 2022; Ronkvist et al ., 2009; Numoto et al ., 2020; Kitadokoro et al ., 2012; 
Sulaiman et al ., 2011). Recent studies have further used directed evolution or AI/ML-based 
approaches to engineer or design thermostable or high-efficiency hydrolases for effective PET

degradation, such as HotPETase, TurboPETase, DepoPETase, and PES-H1L92F/Q94Y (Bell et al ., 
2022; Cui et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; Pfaff et al., 2022).

Terephthalate. 
Although all these hydrolases reveal effective PET degradation, their efficiency has been 
mainly demonstrated to depolymerize amorphous PET film or powder of amorphous PET, but 
rarely crystalline PET (Arnal et al ., 2023). As the PET plastic waste consists of high-
crystallinity PET plastic and its products, an efficient thermostable PET-degrading hydrolase 
capable of degrading crystalline PET sheets is of immense importance (Thomsen et al ., 2023). 
Moreover, plastics, after being discarded, end up in the soil and water bodies of different 
climatic conditions, which contain different compositions of ionic species that may affect the 
catalytic efficiency of the PETase when applied directly in in situ conditions (Zhu et al., 2021; 
Bergeson et al., 2024). To develop a potent enzyme-based technology, the effective enzymes 
capable of degrading PET plastics should be analyzed for their degradation efficiency in in situ 
conditions.      
Phthalate diester plasticizers, including the high-priority pollutant bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP), are extensively used in plastic products  and accompany the increased plastic waste in 
landfills (Klotz et al., 2024). Previous studies have reported EstS1 esterase, a thermostable and 
pH-tolerant esterase, from Sulfobacillus acidophilus  DSM10332 for its broad substrate 
specificity against a wide range of low molecular weight phthalate diesters plasticizers. The 
effective thermostability of this enzyme at a temperature above 70 °C provides it with an 
exceptional advantage (Zhang et al., 2014). Earlier, we discovered the degradation potential of 
this enzyme against the high molecular weight phthalate diester DEHP (Verma et al., 2024)

The present study elucidates the PET plastic-degrading ability of the EstS1 esterase, 
highlighting its potential to degrade both PET plastic and phthalate diester plasticizers. The 
biochemical analysis using HPLC and LC-MS was performed to reveal effective BHET 
degradation at 37 °C and formation of MHET, terephthalic acid, and ethylene glycol, disclosing 
the potential of EstS1 to mediate the conversion of BHET into MHET and then MHET to 
terephthalic acid. The crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 in complex with BHET revealed the 
electron densities of one molecule each of BHET, MHET, and ethylene glycol in the difference 
Fourier map, while the structure of Ser154Ala mutant of EstS1 esterase complexed with BHET 
showed intact two molecules of BHET tracing the active site tunnel of the enzyme, 
demonstrating the catalytically active form of the enzyme in the crystallization condition. 
Further, the molecular dynamics of EstS1-BHET complex over a period of 1 
μ s exposed the 
stable interaction of BHET at the catalytic site. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis 
of crystalline PET film showed significant degradation over the period of 15 days by EstS1 
esterase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed increase in -C-O-, -C-N-, -
N-H-, and -N=O- bonds after degradation. Moreover, to mimic the environmental condition, 
the EstS1 PET degrading ability was evaluated in soil soaked with EstS1 esterase, and effective 
degradation was observed in ecological temperature conditions, proving the immense ability of 
EstS1 to withstand the environmental changes. Therefore, the present analysis determines 
EstS1 esterase as a double-edged sword capable of dealing with both plastic and plasticizer 
pollution.         
2. Results  
The exponentially growing pollution of plastics is posing harm to all life forms. The frequently 
used PET plastic accounts for a major portion of the total accumulated plastics on Earth in 
different environmental niches. Bioremediation has been identified as the most effective 
approach to deal with growing plastic levels (Joseph et al., 2024). Numerous PET-degrading 
enzymes have been characterized, and some engineered enzymes have been developed. Though 
much research has been conducted, very few effective enzymes for the degradation of 
crystalline PET plastic have been translated into technology for application in in situ  
conditions, either due to low efficiency against high crystallinity PET or temperature 
sensitivity, or inhibition from ionic species present in the environmental soil in in situ 
conditions (Samak et al., 2020). In the present study, EstS1 esterase, a thermostable and pH-
tolerant phthalate diesters-degrading esterase, has been characterized for its potential to degrade 
PET plastic in controlled as well as in situ conditions, thus can be utilized for the development

of technologies for bioremediation of both plastics and their plasticizers (Zhang et al., 2014; 
Verma et al., 2024).   
2.1. BHET degradation kinetics of EstS1 esterase  
The wild-type and Ser154Ala mutant of EstS1 esterase (34 kDa) cloned in the pET28a vector 
were purified up to 99% purity and concentrated to a concentration of 50 mg/mL (Figure S1). 
HPLC-based steady-state kinetics was performed using different concentrations of BHET to 
analyze the BHET degradation efficiency of the wild-type EstS1 esterase. The analysis of 
BHET in the presence and absence of EstS1 esterase was done for each considered 
concentration. The absorbance of BHET was monitored at 240 nm, and a significant peak of 
BHET was obtained at a retention time (t
R) of 1.67 min (Figure 2). The reduction in the peak 
absorption in the presence of EstS1 esterase compared to the control was quantified using peak 
area, and thus, the degradation of BHET was estimated (Figure 2). The BHET degradation was 
observed to increase with the increase in concentration of BHET from 65% to 75%, indicating 
the first-order zone of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which encourages the most accurate 
estimation of k
cat/Km. The k cat/Km value estimated for BHET degradation was 13.63 M -1 sec-1, 
and the Vmax and Km values were obtained to be  209.48 µM/min and 17.09 mM, respectively.

by EstS1 esterase. The absorbance at 240 nm showed a reduction in reaction (which 
corresponds to BHET concentration) as compared to the standard (control). 
2.2. Identification of BHET degradation products 
An LC-MS-based analysis was performed to further analyze the degradation of BHET by EstS1 
esterase. The products of BHET degradation, i.e., MHET and ethylene glycol, along with TPA, 
were detected at retention times (t
R) 8.12 min, 7.16 min, and 1.66 min, respectively, in negative 
ion mode (Figure 3 A, B, and C). Similar studies have reported the identification of the BHET 
products in negative ion modes, while BHET was identified in positive ion mode (
Ś widerek et 
al., 2023) (Figure S2). The detection of TPA as a degradation product revealed the ability of 
EstS1 to catalyze the conversion of BHET to MHET and MHET to TPA, thus mediating 
cleavage of both the ester bond present in BHET (De Queiros Eugenio et al ., 2021). The 
intensity versus mass/charge (m/z) ratio spectra of MHET, TPA, and ethylene glycol depict 
significant intensity peaks at the m/z values of 209.05, 165.02, and 62.96, which are close to 
the molecular masses of MHET (209.17 g/mol), TPA (164.11 g/mol), and ethylene glycol 
(62.07 g/mol) further confirming the presence of these compounds (Aristizábal-Lanza et al., 
2022) (Figure 3 D, E, and F).

2.3. Complex crystal structures of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET 
The co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET was solved in space group P63 at 2.2 Å 
with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The refinement quality parameters of R
work and Rfree 
were 19.2% and 24.95% (Table 1). The structure of EstS1 esterase comprised of 304 residues 
of which 12 residues (Glu8, Lys32, Arg70, Arg133, Lys145, Ser164, Arg166, Arg198, Ser231, 
Arg262, Glu269, Gln270) were observed in alternate conformation. The electron density map 
of residues Gln13 to Ser23 was missing due to the high flexibility of this loop. The EstS1 
belongs to an 
α /β  hydrolase family having a characteristic fold of 8 β -strands with intermittent 
12 α -helices and a β -strand Pro60-Tyr66 running anti-parallel to the other 7 β -strands. The 
residues Tyr181 to Pro239 form the cap domain over the catalytic site, consisting of Ser154, 
His278, and Asp248 catalytic triad (Verma et al., 2024).  
The co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET revealed the catalytically active form of 
the enzyme in the crystal, as the difference Fourier map displayed the densities of one molecule 
each of BHET, MHET, and ethylene glycol contoured at 3
σ  (Figure 4 A and B). The overall 
structure of EstS1 consists of two surface cavities connecting together to form a tunnel that 
centres the catalytic site (Figure 4 C). The surface cavity 1, constructed by the cap domain 
heading toward the active site, has been identified in our previous work to mediate the entry of 
the substrate (Verma et al., 2024). In the present study, one molecule of MHET, the product of 
the reaction, was observed at the active site, forming hydrogen bonds with the catalytic Ser154, 
the oxyanion hole residues Ala155, Gly84, Gly83, and a water molecule, depicting the actual 
second tetrahedral intermediate of the canonical catalytic mechanism of esterase (Verma et al., 
2024; Long & Cravatt, 2011) (Figure 4 B and C). The O4 atom of MHET formed a hydrogen 
bond with the OG atom of Ser154 at a distance of 2.5 Å, while the O5 atom of MHET formed 3 
hydrogen bonds, with the backbone N of Ala 155 at a distance of 3.3 Å, the oxygen atom of 
water at 2.7 Å, and the backbone N atom of Gly84 at 3.1 Å, respectively. The water molecule 
found in the catalytic site in turn, formed a hydrogen bond network with the catalytic serine and 
the oxyanion hole residues, thereby stabilizing the complex (Figure 4 B). The tail containing 
the second ester linkage of the formed product MHET was observed to be sandwiched between

the two methionine residues Met186 and Met207, of which Met207 has been previously 
mentioned to stabilize substrate binding in the active site cavity to mediate the catalysis (Verma 
et al., 2024) (Figure 4 B). These two methionine residues contribute to the cap domain, which 
is likely to provide substrate specificity. Two water molecules were also present in the cavity, 
mediating the interaction of the O3 atom of the carbonyl carbon of MHET with the methionine 
residues (Figure 4 B). The BHET molecule in the catalytic tunnel was observed near cavity 2, 
due to the presence of hydrophilic residues Thr92, His93, and Thr282 in its close vicinity, the 
resulting orientation placed BHET at a distance from the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole, 
thus preventing its degradation (Figure 4 B and C). Therefore, confirming cavity 1 as an 
effective site for entry of the substrate to mediate the catalysis.

To further understand the interaction of EstS1 esterase with BHET an active site mutant of 
Ser154Ala EstS1 was purified and co-crystallized with the BHET. The co-crystal structure of 
Ser154Ala mutant EstS1 esterase with BHET was solved at 2 Å in P63 space group with R
work 
and R free of 17.81% and 22.16% respectively (Table 1). The residues Arg6, Lys32, Thr57, 
Ile129, Lys168, Ser222, and Ser231 were found to be present in alternate conformation, and the 
electron density of the loop comprising Gln13 to Ser23 residues was missing. This complex 
structure revealed the electron densities of two BHET molecules in the difference Fourier map 
contoured at 3
σ  (Figure 5 A). One molecule of BHET was observed at the active site and 
seemed to enter from cavity 1, while the other molecule was in front of the first one and 
towards cavity 2 (Figure 5 B). The orientation of the BHET molecule bound at the active was 
similar to that of the degraded product MHET discussed above and was favourable for 
mediating catalysis but due the presence of alanine (Ala154) in place of catalytic serine 
(Ser154) the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond did not interact with the Ala154 while the 
terminal hydroxyl group O1 atom of the BHET formed hydrogen bonds with backbone 
nitrogen atoms of Gly83, Gly84 and Ala155 at a distance of 2.8, 2.7 and 2.9 Å respectively. 
Moreover, the hydrophilic residues and network of water in the catalytic tunnel towards cavity 
2 resulted in a curved orientation of the second BHET molecule, resulting in its inaccessibility 
to the catalytic site (Figure 5 B and C).

Therefore, structural analysis of EstS1-BHET complexes revealed that though BHET seems to 
enter from both the cavity 1 (hydrophobic) and 2 (hydrophilic) due to the presence of 
hydrophobic ring and carbon chain, and the hydrophilic terminal hydroxyl groups respectively 
but the hydrophobic nature of the cavity 1 mediated binding of BHET in the proper orientation 
of the hydrophobic ring and the carbon chains tail to promote catalysis.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of apo-EstS1 and EstS1-BHET complex to study the 
interaction dynamics of EstS1 esterase with BHET was performed over a period of 1 μ s. The 
analysis of the MD simulation trajectory revealed high stability of the EstS1 esterase when 
present in complex form as compared to the apo-protein. The RMSD values ranged within a 
narrow range of 0.20 to 0.30 nm in complex form compared to 0.15 to 0.35 nm for the apo-
form of the protein, indicating high stability of the complex (Schreiner et al., 2012) (Figure 6 
A). The least variation in Rg values within 1.81 to 1.85 nm disclosed high compactness of the 
protein during the simulation trajectory of 1 
μ s (Filipe & Loura, 2022) (Figure 6 B). The RMSF 
versus residue plots showed a reduction in fluctuation in residues ranging from Tyr181 to 
Pro239 in complex form compared to the apo-protein. These residues contribute to the cap 
domain, which mediates the entry of the substrate. The reduction in fluctuations in the cap 
domain in complex form discloses that binding of the substrate at the catalytic site imparts 
stability to the cap domain during the simulation (Benson & Daggett, 2012) (Figure 6 C). The 
solvent accessible surface area analysis during the trajectory time showed variation in the range 
of 127 to 140 nm
2 in complex form, while the variation in apo-form ranged from 123 to 144 
nm2, in turn showing reduction in solvent accessible surface area and hence increase in 
compactness and stability of the protein in complex form (Durham et al., 2009) (Figure 6 D). 
The variation in secondary structures showed an increase in the alpha-helicity and a significant 
decrease in the coiled structures in the complex form compared to the apo-form of the enzyme, 
indicating high stability of the complex form (Coskuner-Weber & Caglayan, 2021) (Figure 6 E 
and F). The steepness of the free energy landscape of EstS1-BHET complex revealed 
attainment of global minima or a properly folded low-energy state during the trajectory, as 
compared to local minima or partially folded states observed in the apo-protein (Maisuradze et 
al., 2010) (Figure 7 A and B). The consistent intermolecular hydrogen bonding between EstS1 
and BHET showed effective interaction during the trajectory at the active site of the enzyme 
(Bondar & White, 2011) (Figure 7 C). The clustering analysis of the 1 
μ s trajectory disclosed a 
large number of structures in the top 10 clusters (Figure 7 D). The superimposition of the 
representative structures of the top 10 clusters revealed that the BHET was consistently bound 
at the active site, interacting with the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole residues (Phillips et 
al., 2011) (Figure 7 E). Thus, the present analysis provides compelling evidence for the highly 
stable and consistent interaction of BHET at the active site of EstS1 esterase.

2.6. Microscopic analysis of PET film for degradation in controlled conditions at 25 °C 
and in environmental conditions in soil 
The biochemical, crystal structure, and molecular dynamics simulation-based analysis 
disclosed the efficiency of EstS1 esterase in degrading BHET, a monomer of PET film. To 
evaluate the PET film degrading efficiency of the EstS1 esterase, the crystalline PET film was 
soaked with the EstS1 esterase for a duration of 15 days in controlled temperature conditions at 
25 °C. The SEM analysis of the PET film after a duration of 15 days displayed erosion and 
cracks on PET film, revealing efficient EstS1-mediated degradation of crystalline PET film 
visible at a 1000X to 10000X magnification (Figure 8). Further to analyze the efficiency of 
PET degradation in natural environmental conditions, the PET film was incubated in soil 
augmented with EstS1 esterase and soil without the enzyme as a control sample. The samples 
were placed in a natural environment in glass bottles to encounter regular variations in

temperature and pressure for 15 days. The SEM analysis of the samples after 15 days showed 
indents and erosion of the surface of the film, concluding efficient degradation of the PET film 
at 1000X to 25000X magnification in the presence of diverse ionic concentrations of soil 
(Figure 9). This analysis provides evidence for the significant applicability of the EstS1 
esterase in in situ conditions to ameliorate the increasing concentration of microplastics and 
plastics in the environment.

2.7. Elemental and surface chemistry analysis of PET film for degradation by EstS1 
XPS analysis of the PET film sample subjected to EstS1 enzyme treatment and the control 
sample was performed to evaluate the changes in elemental composition and properties of 
chemical bonding due to degradation by EstS1. The counts per second versus binding energy 
survey spectra of surface (initial) and at a depth of 50 nm (final), displaying the atomic 
composition, reveal the presence of nitrogen element in the treated sample compared to the 
absence of nitrogen in the control sample (Figure 10 A B). The concentration of nitrogen in 
treatment sample was higher at the surface than at a depth of 50 nm, therefore confirming the 
presence of nitrogen-containing degraded products similar to the past study (Huang et al., 
2024) (Figure 10 A B). The curve fitted C1s intensity versus binding energy spectra of both 
control (C) and treated (T) samples were analysed and significant peaks at 284.562 eV and 
287.876 eV were obtained in control sample which corresponds to -C-C-, and -C=O- bond 
while peaks at 284.562 eV, 285.776 eV and 287.876 eV were observed in treatment sample

The depth analysis of the treated and control PET film for variation in chemical bonding 
properties at every 3 nm up to 50 nm depth was done. The intensity versus binding energy 
spectra of C1s, N1s, and O1s showed significantly high presence of C-O-, -C-N-, -N-H- (400 
eV), -N-O- (404 and 408 eV), and -C-O- bonds indicated by peaks at different binding energies 
in treated samples with higher prevalence at the upper surface compared to the inner surface 
(Figure 11 A B C). In control samples, the peaks were consistent within a short binding energy 
range, showing less diversity in chemical bonding patterns over 50 nm depth (Figure 11 D E F). 
The analysis of variation in atomic concentration with respect to depth of film showed a high 
amount of nitrogen and oxygen at the surface in the treatment sample at the upper surface

3. Discussion 
Enzymatic degradation of PET plastic is being intensely investigated to deal with the major 
fraction of accumulated PET plastic in the environment, which is responsible for increasing 
plastic pollution. Diverse PETases, BHETases, cutinases, lipases, and esterases have been 
studied for their efficiency in degrading different PET varieties, including amorphous PET, 
nanoPET, semi-crystalline PET, and crystalline PET. Several studies have engineered these 
enzymes to enhance their thermostability and efficiency to a greater extent (Bell et al., 2022; 
Cui et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; Pfaff et al., 2022).

EstS1 esterase from Sulfobacillus acidophilus DSM10332 strain is a thermostable, pH-tolerant 
phthalate diester-degrading enzyme capable of degrading a broad range of phthalate diesters 
(Zhang et al ., 2014; Verma et al ., 2024). The present study elucidates the BHET and PET 
degrading ability of the EstS1 esterase utilizing biochemical, structural, in silico , and SEM 
analysis-based approach. Around 75% degradation of BHET by EstS1 esterase was observed 
over a period of 1 h, resulting in the formation of MHET and TPA, concluding the ability of 
EstS1 esterase to convert BHET into MHET and then MHET into TPA. Previous study on 
Streptomyces strains characterized the BHET-degrading potential of Streptomyces LipA lipase 
variants and identified mild TPA formation compared to MHET, with low activity above 40 °C 
due to the lack of enzyme stability at high temperatures (Verschoor et al ., 2024). EstS1 
esterase, a highly thermostable esterase, annotated as triacylglycerol lipase, produced a 
significant concentration of TPA as compared to the MHET. HtDLH, a thermostable hydrolase 
of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus reported for PET, BHET, and MHET degradation, shows 
comparable BHET degradation to EstS1 esterase (Almeida et al., 2024). Several other studies 
reported engineered PETase enzymes having high catalytic activity against BHET, while the 
catalytic efficiencies of wild-type enzymes were comparable to that of EstS1 esterase analyzed 
in the present study (Bell et al., 2022; Pfaff et al., 2022; Numoto et al., 2020; Kitadokoro et al., 
2012; Sulaiman et al., 2011). 
To illustrate the structural aspects of BHET interaction at the active site of EstS1 esterase, the 
co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 esterase with BHET was determined and revealed not 
only the presence of the active form of EstS1 esterase in the crystal form, but also the density 
of MHET and ethylene glycol along with BHET. The bound MHET (the product of BHET 
degradation) at the active site depicted the exact second tetrahedral intermediate conformation 
of the canonical serine hydrolase mechanism. The cap domain, which mediates the substrate 
specificity, varies in length in different esterase and PETase enzymes (Distaso et al ., 2023). 
The cap domain of EstS1 of 59 residues forms cavity 1, which mediates the entry of the 
substrate. The two methionine (Met186 and Met207) residues of the EstS1 esterase, lying in the 
cap domain, provide a proper orientation to the substrate to interact with the catalytic triad, thus 
mediating catalysis. Similar contributions of the cap domain residues in mediating effective 
substrate binding have been reported in previous studies on MHETase (Knott et al., 2020). Joo 
et al., 2018, in their structural analysis of IsPETase, reported Met161 and Ile208 as the lead 
residues providing a hydrophobic surface for substrate binding, similar to the hydrophobic 
residues Met186 and Met207 present in cavity 1 of the EstS1 esterase (Joo et al., 2018). The

presence of one intact BHET molecule (undegraded) near cavity 2, even in the active form of 
the enzyme, in turn determines the essentiality of the cap domain (forming cavity 1) in 
contributing to the catalysis by providing correct orientation to the substrate at the active site. 
Comparative analysis of known PETase enzymes with EstS1 disclosed the least sequence and 
structural similarity, revealing a novel PET-degrading enzyme scaffold in EstS1 esterase. The 
large cap domain of EstS1, compared to the other PET-degrading enzymes, provides a massive 
scope for further enzyme engineering studies to improve its efficiency (Luan et al., 2016).  
The complex structure of the Ser154Ala active site mutant of EstS1 in complex with BHET 
exhibited the presence of two BHET molecules bound in the catalytic tunnel of EstS1, one after 
the other, demonstrating the significant size of the tunnel to accommodate the PET polymer. 
Further, in silico  structural analysis displayed high stability of the EstS1 esterase in the 
presence of BHET, directing towards highly favorable interactions of BHET with the active site 
residues of the enzyme. The free energy landscape of the EstS1-BHET complex showed 
attainment of the stable low-energy state of the enzyme (Benkovic et al., 2008).  
Moreover, the erosion and indentation of crystalline PET film surface in the presence of the 
enzyme in both controlled conditions and soil system with varying temperature conditions 
confirmed effective crystalline PET degradation potential, high stability, and ionic tolerance of 
EstS1 esterase. Though several studies have analyzed the PET film degradation using 
amorphous PET film, nano PET, and PET microplastics, very few studies have been conducted 
for the degradation of crystalline PET in conditions mimicking the original environment 
(Wilkes et al., 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024; J. Kim et al ., 2023). The XPS-based surface and 
depth profiling analysis discovered a higher concentration of nitrogen in the treatment sample 
compared to the extremely low concentration in the control samples. Also, the formation of -C-
O-, -C-N-, -C=O-, -C=N-, -N-H-, and -N=O- bonds was observed to increase in the treatment 
sample while the prevalence of these bonds was less in the control samples, thus proving the 
degradation of the PET film (Doren et al., 1994). Further, the atomic concentration versus 
depth plot showed a lower proportion of carbon on the surface of the enzyme-treated sample 
compared to the control sample in turn indicating erosion of the surface. Similar increase in 
nitrogen concentration in enzyme treated PET film have been observed in past studies 
indicating effective degradation and production of nitrogen conjugated products containing -C-
N-, -C=N-, -N-H- and -N=O- bonds along with increased formation of -C-O-, and -C=O- bonds 
was reported (Huang et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024)

Therefore, the present study elucidates the PET-degrading potential of a high-potential 
thermostable EstS1 esterase. Its efficiency in degrading crystalline PET plastic and its 
monomer BHET have been evaluated, along with its in-depth structural analysis, displaying the 
mechanism of degradation. Hence, it can be further exploited for enzyme engineering studies to 
develop into a high-efficiency PET as well as phthalate diester plasticizer-degrading enzyme, 
providing a complete solution to the increasing plastic and plasticizer pollution.   
4. Conclusion 
Global plastic pollution has drawn widespread concerns due to its adverse impacts on all life 
forms across the globe. PET-based plastics are leading contributors to the increasing plastic 
pollution. Bioremediation of plastics using potential enzymes is a safe, eco-friendly, and 
effective approach. In this piece of work, we have identified the BHET and PET degrading 
potential of a EstS1 phthalate diesters-degrading pH-tolerant and thermostable esterase from 
Sulfobacillus acidophilus DSM10332 strain. The kinetic and LC-MS-based analysis disclosed 
up to 75% degradation of BHET, a PET monomer, into MHET and terephthalic acid. Complex 
crystal structures of wild-type and mutant forms of EstS1 esterase with BHET have 
demonstrated the mechanistic insights of the enzyme, representing the cap domain residues as 
effective contributors responsible for the proper orientation of the substrate at the active site. 
Further, the cavity 1 formed by the cap domain was identified as the exact entry site for the 
substrate to mediate the reaction. In silico analysis of the EstS1-BHET complex exhibited that 
the enzyme attains a highly stable, low-energy folded state in the presence of substrate. 
Eventually, the variations in elemental composition and chemical bonding via XPS and 
corroded surface and indents on the surface of crystalline PET film via SEM analysis were 
observed in incubated PET film with EstS1 esterase, which provided strong evidence for the 
PET degradation potential of EstS1 esterase in constant and varying temperature conditions, 
mimicking the environmental variations. Henceforth, further enzyme engineering of EstS1 
esterase can provide a highly potent solution to the exponentially growing plastics as well as 
plasticizer pollution to attain the goals of a sustainable environment.

5.1. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of EstS1 and Its Active Site Mutant   
The cloning, expression, and purification of  EstS1 esterase and its mutant were performed

recombinant plasmid of EstS1 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Microbial Type 
Culture Collection (MTCC) Chandigarh, India). The 1 L Luria-Bertani liquid broth was 
inoculated at 1 % v/v inoculum and kept at 37 °C until the optical density of the culture at 600 
nm reached 0.6. The expression was checked by adding isopropyl 
β -D-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) as inducer at a concentration of 0.5 mM. The induced culture was shifted to 16 °C for 
incubation for 16 h. The cell mass was obtained and resuspended in 10 mL lysis or purification 
buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer, 10 % v/v glycerol, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The cells 
were lysed at 20 psi using a constant cell disruptor, and the lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 
12000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and transferred to a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA 
affinity column with purification buffer and incubated for 10 min (Mahto et al ., 2022). The 
gradient of imidazole from 10 to 500 mM was applied to the incubated Ni-NTA column, and 
the fractions were collected. SDS-PAGE was performed to analyze the fractions, and the 
fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated using a 30 kDa Millipore 
Amplicon filter and were later dialyzed with 100 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 (Verma et al., 
2024). The concentration of the protein was evaluated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
standard and Pierce Micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).  
A site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to prepare the active site mutant Ser154Ala of 
EstS1 esterase (Bachman, 2013). The recombinant plasmids of pET28a-EstS1 were amplified 
with forward and reverse primers as mentioned below. The product of amplification was 
subjected to DpnI enzyme digestion, and then transformed into E. coli  DH5
α  cells. The 
transformed cells were cultured, and the mutated plasmids were isolated using the Plasmid 
Isolation Kit (Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit Cat no. 27104) and confirmed by DNA 
sequencing (Verma et al., 2024). The transformation of the confirmed plasmids was done in E. 
coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the mutant protein was purified using the above-mentioned 
protocol.

5.2. HPLC analysis of BHET degradation kinetics  
The BHET degradation was quantified using a Waters high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). The reactions of 1 mL each containing different concentrations (100, 200, 400, and 
500 
μ M) of BHET were incubated with 15 μ M of enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C. The termination of 
reactions was done by the addition of 100% methanol in a 1:1 ratio, and the reactions were then

filtered through nylon syringe filters (0.2 μ m) (Li et al. , 2023). The BHET degradation was 
analysed on a Waters C18 XBridge column (150 x 4.6 mm; particle size 5 µ) by isocratic 
elution (0.7 mL/min), using a mobile phase consisting of methanol–acidified water (0.1% 
formic acid) in the ratio of 80:20 ( Lyoo et al., 2000; Boros et al ., 2025). The chromatograms 
were monitored at 240 nm.  The buffer and enzyme control samples were also analyzed, along 
with the BHET standard solutions (100, 200, 400, and 500 μ M) without enzyme to plot the 
standard curve. All control and enzyme-treated samples were analyzed in triplicate, and average 
values were utilized for the calculation of Vmax, Km, and kcat/Km (Counotte & Prins, 1979).     
5.3. LC-MS analysis for product identification 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to analyze the degradation 
of BHET by EstS1 esterase. The 1 mL enzyme reactions containing 5 mM BHET and 15 μ M 
EstS1 esterase were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in triplicate. The reaction was terminated by 
adding 1mL 100% methanol. The reactions were then filtered through 0.2 
μ m nylon filters. 
Chromatographic separation using reverse phase chromatography was performed using a C18 
reverse phase column (Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH column) of dimension 1.7 
μ m, 2.1 mm × 
100 mm. The mobile phase consists of 0.1 % v/v formic acid in methanol and water at a flow 
rate of 0.3 mL/min. The elution gradient was used over 20 min, ranging from 100% water to 
100% methanol (Swamy et al., 2024).  
Mass spectrometry analysis was done using an Xevo G2-XS QTof Quadrupole Time-of-Flight 
Mass Spectrometry system (Waters) in both positive and negative ionization modes. The 
conditions applied for mass spectrum acquisition consist of cone and capillary voltages of 50 V 
and 3 kV , respectively. The source and desolvation temperatures were 450 °C and 120 °C, and 
the gas flow rates of the cone and desolvation were 50 L/h and 900 L/h, respectively. Electron 
spray ionization with a scan range of 100-1000 m/z and 1 s scan time was used. The parameter 
of collision energy for low energy was 6 eV , and for high energy, a ramp from 20 to 30 eV was 
set with a time of acquisition of 8 min. Processing of LC-MS data was done using Waters 
UNIFI software (Waters), and the target by mass approach was utilized. Other parameters, 
including the maximum number of targets, fragment match tolerance, target match tolerance, 
and ion ratio tolerance, were specified. Further threshold values from candidates per sample, 
relative intensity, and peaks per channel were added. The expected ratio values of m/z for 
BHET, MHET, terephthalic acid, and ethylene glycol were identified by MestReNova software

The co-crystallization of both wild-type and Ser154Ala active site mutant of EstS1 at an 
enzyme concentration of 10 mg/mL was performed with BHET (10 mM) using our previously 
mentioned crystallization condition of 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 0.5% v/v Jeffamine ED-2001, 
and 1.1 M sodium malonate. The sitting drop method for crystallization was used at a 1:1 
protein to reservoir ratio and a temperature of 20 °C. The rod-shaped crystals obtained were 
cryoprotected in mother liquor and flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K (Verma et 
al., 2024).   
Data collection was performed at the home source X-ray diffractometer integrated with an X-
ray generator (Rigaku Micromax-007 HF), having a high-intensity rotating microfocus Cu 
anode and a Hypix Rigaku 6000C detector available at the Macromolecular Crystallography 
Unit, IIC, IIT Roorkee. The complex crystal structures were solved using the apo-EstS1 
structure (PDB: 9J1E) as search model using the molecular replacement method MOLREP of 
CCP4i2 suite and Phenix 1.20.1 (Verma et al., 2024; Vagin & Teplyakov, 2009; Potterton et al., 
2018; Adams et al ., 2010). Iterative rounds of building the model, followed by refinement, 
were performed utilizing Coot v0.9.8.95, REFMAC, and phenix.refine (Emsley & Cowtan, 
2004; Murshudov et al., 2011; Afonine et al ., 2012). The co-crystal structure of the wild-type 
EstS1-BHET complex revealed the presence of BHET as well as MHET and ethylene glycol in 
the catalytic tunnel, while the co-crystal Ser154Ala active site mutant of EstS1-BHET resulted 
in electron densities of two molecules of BHET in the catalytic tunnel. Omit maps were 
generated for the bound ligands using Phenix. The interaction and surface diagrams were 
generated using PyMol ( https://www.pymol.org/
) and Chimera 
(https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) (Rigsby & Parker, 2016; Pettersen et al., 2004).  
5.5. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis 
The co-crystal structure of Ser154Ala mutant EstS1-BHET was used to study the dynamics of 
interaction of BHET within the active site tunnel using the molecular dynamics simulation 
approach. The alanine residue at the active site was mutated to a serine residue using Coot 
software to analyze the actual mechanism of interaction of wild-type EstS1 with BHET. The 
apo and the BHET complex forms of EstS1 were subjected to 1 
μ s MD simulations each using 
the GROMACS 2020 software (Pronk et al ., 2013). The CGenFF web server was used to 
generate the topology of BHET, and the CHARMM36 force field was used for the topology of 
the protein (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2009; Huang & MacKerell, 2013). The dodecahedron box 
was used for solvation of the apo and complex structures of the EstS1 esterase, and the systems 
were neutralized using sodium ions. The energy minimization of the systems was performed

using a maximum force of 10 kJ/mol. Then the minimized systems were equilibrated using 
Number of particles, V olume, Temperature (NVT) and Number of particles, Pressure, 
Temperature (NPT) ensembles for 100 ps each. Eventually, the MD simulation run of 1 
μ s each 
was performed for both the apo and BHET complex systems.  
The analysis of the MD simulation trajectories was performed by evaluating variations in Root 
Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Radius of gyration (Rg), Root Mean Square Fluctuation 
(RMSF), Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), Secondary Structure (SS), and number of 
hydrogen bonds during the trajectory (Hollingsworth & Dror, 2018). The Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) was performed for all the trajectory frames, and the free energy landscapes 
were generated for both the apo-protein and complex form of the protein (David & Jacobs, 
2013). The clustering analysis to study the effective interactions of BHET with the catalytic 
tunnel of EstS1 was done considering an RMSD cutoff of 0.2, and the representative frames of 
the top 10 clusters were superimposed to study changes in the structure in complex form and 
the interaction mechanism of EstS1 with BHET (Abramyan et al., 2016). All plots of the MD 
simulation analysis were prepared using Origin 2024 software ( https://www.originlab.com/
), 
and images of representative clusters showing 3D interactions of BHET with EstS1 were 
generated using PyMol software (https://www.pymol.org/) (Rigsby & Parker, 2016).  
5.6. PET film degradation analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging 
The small pieces of crystalline PET films (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) were soaked in the 
presence of EstS1 esterase (15 μ M) for a duration of 15 days at 25 °C. Control samples without 
protein using 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 were also prepared. After 15 days, the 
samples were collected and washed with 70% ethanol and distilled water to remove traces of 
enzyme and buffer. The morphological analysis of films was done for both enzyme-treated and 
control samples using a scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher, Apreo S Low Vac, 2011) 
at 15 kV accelerating voltage. Film samples were gold-coated at 18 mA for 140 s. Digital 
images were generated using Apreo SEM imaging software (Yan et al ., 2020; Ducoli et al., 
2023).  
5.7. Analysis of PET film degradation in natural conditions 
The ionic composition of soil often poses an inhibitory effect on the enzymes present in the 
soil. To analyze the effect of soil ionic composition on EstS1 PET degradation activity, the PET 
film was cut into small pieces of equal weight and incubated in samples containing soil+buffer 
(soil control), and soil+buffer+EstS1 (soil treatment). The soil used for the experiment was

collected from the nearest garden at IIC, IIT Roorkee, and the unwanted particles were 
removed. The clean soil was subjected to autoclaving at 15 psi for 20 min to remove the 
possibility of any other microbe enhancing the degradation. 6 g of autoclaved soil was used in 
each soil sample (treatment and control).15 
μ M of enzyme concentration was used in the 
treatment samples of soil, and an equivalent volume of buffer was used in the control sample. 
All control and treatment samples were kept outside in native environmental conditions in 
covered small glass bottles to mimic the in situ conditions of temperature (ranging from 40 °C 
in the afternoon to 28 °C at night) and pressure for 15 days (Liu et al., 2023). The degradation 
effect of EstS1 esterase in treatment versus control samples was analyzed using a scanning 
electron microscope (EVO 18, Carl Zeiss, 2012, and ZEISS SmartSEM software) at 15 kV as 
mentioned above. The PET film samples were washed with 70% ethanol before SEM analysis, 
followed by distilled water to remove any traces of soil and enzymes. All experiments were 
performed in triplicate. This experiment provides scope for the direct in situ application of the 
EstS1 esterase in soil for PET plastic degradation (Y an et al., 2020; Ducoli et al., 2023).  
5.8. PET film degradation analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis 
To further analyze the change in surface chemistry due to the degradation of the PET film by 
EstS1 esterase, the surface analysis of the PET film was performed by X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy. The PET film (thickness 0.1 mm, Goodfellow) samples incubated with EstS1 
esterase (15 
μ M) for 15 days, along with control samples incubated with an equivalent volume 
of 100 mM phosphate buffer in natural environmental conditions in small glass bottles, were 
subjected to XPS analysis. The PET samples were washed with 70% ethanol and twice with 
distilled water to remove any traces of enzyme and buffer from the samples. The change in 
carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen elements’ composition, chemical state, and bonding was studied 
up to a depth of 50 nm by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI 5000 Versa Probe III; 
Ulvac-Phi, Inc). Ultrahigh vacuum of 2 * 10
-7 Pa with Al Kα  monochromatic source of energy 
1.48 keV was used. The beam diameter of 100 µm, stage tilt angle of 45°, charge neutralizer 
with 15 V and 20 µA, and non-conductive tape as substrate were used for the analysis. Survey 
scan spectra were collected with an energy of 280 eV and 0.05 eV energy step. The high-
resolution spectra of C1s, O1s, and N1s were recorded with 55 eV pass energy and 0.05 eV 
energy step. The C1s standard at 284.80 eV was considered as a reference. To analyze the 
chemical bonds, the carbon C1s and oxygen O1s region peaks were fitted. The Multipak XPS 
software for deconvolution and data analysis was used (Doren et al., 1994).
