Plastic waste has become a substantial environmental issue. A
potential strategy to mitigate this problem is to use enzymatic
hydrolysis of plastics to depolymerize post-consumer waste and
allow it to be reused. Over the last few decades, the use of
enzymatic PET-degrading enzymes has shown promise as a
great solution for creating a circular plastic waste economy.
PsPETase from Piscinibacter sakaiensis has been identified as an
enzyme with tremendous potential for such applications. But to
improve its efficiency, enzyme engineering has been applied
aiming at enhancing its thermal stability, enzymatic activity,
and ease of production. Here, we combine different strategies
such as structure-based rational design, ancestral sequence
reconstruction and machine learning to engineer a more highly
active Combi-PETase variant with a melting temperature of
70 ° C and optimal performance at 60 ° C. Furthermore, this study
demonstrates that these approaches, commonly used in other
works of enzyme engineering, are most effective when utilized
in combination, enabling the improvement of enzymes for
industrial applications.
Introduction
The escalating global issue of plastic waste accumulation and
its improper disposal practices have led to significant environ-
mental and health concerns. The adverse impacts of plastic
pollution on ecosystems are being increasingly recognized
[1]
and recent discoveries highlight how the ingestion of micro-
plastics pose potential risks to human health as well.
[2]
There is
a critical need to address these global challenges and to
minimize the ecological harm caused by plastic waste. World-
wide, only 9 % of plastic waste gets recycled,
[3]
mostly by
thermomechanical methods that result in a less valuable
product. “Advanced recycling” is the conversion of plastic waste
into monomers or other valuable raw materials by means of
cracking, gasification or depolymerization, excluding energy
recovery and incineration. The resulting materials can be used
to manufacture recycled products of high quality, enabling a
truly circular economy for plastic materials. Amongst the
advanced recycling technologies, enzymatic depolymerization
offers a relatively simple and cost-effective solution for easily
hydrolysable plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
[4]
Considerable progress has been achieved since the first reports
of enzymatic PET degradation using Thermobifida fusca
cutinase.
[5]
A breakthrough was achieved by Yoshida et al. in
2016 with the discovery of the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis
(now currently known as Piscinibacter sakaiensis), the first
microorganism that showed ability to use PET as a primary
carbon source
[6]
and which was later engineered to turn non-
biodegradable PET into biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHA).
[7,8]
P. sakaiensis breaks down the polyester chains using a PET
hydrolase enzyme (PsPETase aka IsPETase, basonym Ideonella
sakaiensis), producing the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA)
and mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET). Subsequently,
another exo-hydrolase enzyme (MHETase) cleaves the ester
bond of MHET, yielding TPA and ethylene glycol (EG). The
closest homologs of PsPETase are the cutinase enzymes, a
family of natural polyester hydrolases which includes other
enzymes that have shown promiscuous activity against PET.
Some of these enzymes are more active at higher temperatures
than PsPETase (e. g. LCC cutinase,
[9]
TfH,
[5]
F. solani cutinase
(FsC)
[10]
) but PsPETase is the most efficient enzyme at room
temperature.
[6]
Depolymerization of PET for viable recycling and
bioremediation applications requires engineering of the natu-
rally occurring enzymes to improve their biophysical and

biochemical properties such as: thermal stability,
[11][12]
higher
turnover rates,
[13]
and substrate specificity.
[14,15,16]
Indeed, without
exception, all the natural and engineered variants of PsPETase
and other enzymes are far more active with low-crystalline (lc-
PET) rather than with high-crystalline PET (hc-PET).
[17,18,19,20]
This
hinders their industrial application and/or requires costly
pretreatment of the substrate before the catalytic hydrolysis
step.
[4]
Additionally, the efficient production of the enzyme in
large quantities is crucial for large-scale industrial applications.
It is essential to assess early these critical parameters for
upscaling enzyme-based PET depolymerization when engineer-
ing a new variant of a PETase enzyme.
[21]
Even for a small protein such as PsPETase, which consists of
290 amino acids, the number of possible amino acid mutations,
deletions or insertions to the wild type sequence is over-
whelming. Therefore, the focus of enzyme engineering methods
is to provide guidance in identifying beneficial variants with
desirable traits. Various strategies have been applied to
engineer better variants of PsPETase, with remarkable results.
[18]
Typical strategies include structure- or mechanism-based
methods (e. g. rational design),
[11]
bioinformatics-based methods
(e. g. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction),
[22,23]
directed
evolution
[24]
or ML/AI-based methods (e. g. deep learning,
[25]
and
graph convolutional networks).
[26]
Structure-based rational de-
sign strategies, based on a fundamental understanding of the
role of individual amino acids on the biochemical and
biophysical properties of the enzyme, have produced variants
of PsPETase with increases of 10–30 ° C in the melting
temperature.
[27,28]
A good example of a PsPETase variant
developed by structure-based enzyme engineering is the work
of Son et al. who created the ThermoPETase variant by: i)
structural comparison with other homologous thermophilic
enzymes such as TfCut2; and ii) optimizing hydrogen bond
interactions to stabilize flexible regions based on the observed
B-factor from X-ray structures.
[11]
ThermoPETase has been very
important in the field and used as a starting point for further
development using other techniques. Computational predic-
tions of the enzyme properties can support rational enzyme
engineering by providing a way to screen the possible variants
in silico, increasing the number of variants that can be explored.
An example of this is the DuraPETase variant which showed
remarkably higher stability temperatures, elevated by 31 ° C
compared to the wild type.
[12]
Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) enables the pre-
diction of the sequence of ancestral enzymes based on the
multi-sequence alignment of extant variants. Without the need
of structural information or understanding contribution of each
amino acid substitution to the biophysical properties of the
enzyme, the ASR approach produces enzymes that are often
more thermostable, soluble and promiscuous.
[29,30]
These prop-
erties are very desirable in enzyme engineering and therefore
ASR has been widely used for creating new functionality in
enzymes and to improve their properties.
[22]
We recently applied
ancestral sequence reconstruction to understand the evolu-
tionary history of PsPETase.
[23]
This resulted in the recreation of
ancestral enzymes containing mutations which could not have
been found by rational design methods, as they are not close to
the active site nor their effect could have been predicted.
However, because of their beneficial effects on the thermo-
stability and protein yield, we have introduced them as part of
the multi-methodological approach to obtain an improved
PsPETase variant.
Machine learning and deep learning methods have been
applied to develop both novel plastic degrading enzymes as
well as PET hydrolase variants. Although this is an emerging
strategy with only a limited number of examples, a few
remarkable studies have demonstrated the synergistic effect of
combining ML/AI and rational design methods. For instance,
FAST-PETase is a variant of PsPETase that was developed
combining two mutations from the rational-engineered Ther-
moPETase and three other mutations identified with
MutCompute.
[13]
Similarly, MutCompute was applied to TfCut2
wild type cutinase to identify beneficial mutations and create
an enhanced variant, which exhibited a 5.3-fold improved
depolymerization of crystalline PET.
[31]]
Most recent examples
include the adoption of machine learning-assisted prediction of
the degrading activity of certain plastics
[32]
or the use of
machine learning to guide the directed evolution of plastic
degrading enzymes.
[33]
This paper has applied different approaches such as
structure-based design, ancestral sequence reconstruction and
machine learning to engineer a new variant of PsPETase. We
show that each approach has unique benefits and limitations,
and that they can be applied to complement each other in a
combinatorial approach. We present a new enzyme (namely
Combi-PETase) with improved properties that are critical for
industrial applications.
Results and Discussion
Evaluation of PsPETase Variants
Using the wild type PsPETase as our starting point, we have
applied a combination of structure-based rational design,
ancestral sequence reconstruction and machine learning ap-
proaches over six generations of engineering. We have
characterized the PET hydrolytic activity, thermal stability and
expression levels in E. coli of over 140 variants in an iterative
process of improving the enzyme’s properties. We determined
the thermal stability of each variant by measuring the melting
temperature using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) ex-
periments and we used a fluorescence-based assay of TPA
released to determine the PET hydrolytic activity (see methods).
Figure 1 shows the characterization of the best variants that
were passed to the following generation, accumulating benefi-
cial mutations in the process. The optimal temperature of the
reaction was determined by measuring the enzymatic activity.
For the best variant in each generation, we determined the
optimal temperature of the reaction by measuring the activity
over a range of temperatures (Figure 1A–C, Table 1). Our best
variant (namely Combi-PETase or PETase
ACCCETN
) contains seven
accumulated mutations obtained from different enzyme engi-

temperature, with an optimal reaction temperature of 60 ° C.
PETase
A
– Generation 1
The crystal structure of the wildtype PsPETase in complex with a
substrate analogue (HEMT)
[34]
displays W185 in three different
conformations. This residue is directly interacting with the
HEMT moiety, but because HEMT is a small molecule, the
structure does not reveal other residues that might be involved
in binding the PET substrate. To identify these residues, we
performed a model of a Michaelis complex using a 8mer-PET
polymer as a substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). Our model
indicated that in addition to the interactions with W185, the
8mer-PET polymer is also interacting with residues in the β6-β7
loop (preceded by W185). We performed molecular dynamics
simulations of various substitutions at position 186 and found a
strong dependence of the flexibility of the sidechain of W185
and the β6-β7 loop on the size of residue 186 (Supplementary
Figure S3).
The beneficial effect of the flexibility of W185 and the loops
in the active site with the PET hydrolytic activity has been also
highlighted by Chen et al.
[35]
and Crnjar et al.
[36]
when studying
the double mutant S214H/I218F. Based on the MD simulations,
we mutated residue D186 to alanine, the residue that was
predicted to confer the highest flexibility to the wobbly
tryptophan and the β6-β7 loop. The PETase variant D186A
(PETase
A
) exhibited an increase in melting temperature of
~10 ° C while at the same time retaining a high level of activity
up even at 50 ° C. In the 1.6 Å crystal structure of our variant
Combi-PETase (Figure 2), we refined W185 and observed that
the modelled density around the sidechain of W185 is not
completely supported by an occupancy of 1, as well as
additional density adjacent but not connected to this residue.
However, the additional density was not enough to confidently
model a second conformation as observed in previous
structures.
[37][34]
Together with the high B-factors on the atoms
of W185, it does suggest that W185 is in fact flexible
(Supplementary Figure S6A).
D186 is not conserved in other cutinase enzymes and is
most commonly a histidine in thermostable homologs, so the
single mutant of PsPETase D186A had not been explored
before. The substitution D186H alone does not provide better
activity but it led to the development of ThermoPETase
[11]
which
served as scaffold for developing other variants like

and FAST-PETase.
[13]
This finding aligns with our
previous work where the D186S substitution, also predicted to
increase the flexibility of the loop and of the wobbly tryptophan
(Supplementary Figure S3), yielded a 9 ° C improvement in the
enzyme’s thermostability.
[23]
Other substitutions (e. g., D186I,
D186F, D186 L or D186 V), although being tolerated, led to
reduced enzymatic activity,
[11]
in agreement with the predicted
reduced flexibility. Recently, using a semi-saturation muta-
genesis experiment, Yin et al. identified the double variant
D186A/S121P. Because the crystal structure of the S121P/D186A
double mutant could not resolve various conformations of
W185 side chain, the authors explained the increased activity
was caused by a reduction in the flexibility.
[38]
However, the
authors did not note that this is also common in other crystal
structures of PsPETase variants, and that the different conforma-
tions of the so-called wobbly tryptophan W185 is not always
resolved in multiple conformations. Nailing down all the
possible conformations is difficult- seeing that density is missing
is easy.
PETase
ACC
– Generation 2
To further improve the thermal stability of our PETase
A
variant,
we introduced a third disulfide bridge using the N233C and
S282C mutations. The design of this disulfide bridge was based
on the work of Then et al., who identified a stabilizing calcium
binding site in TfCut2, a homolog enzyme with 51 % sequence
similarity of PETase.
[39]
By engineering a disulfide bridge in that
position, the authors mimicked the effect of calcium binding
and increased the Tm of TfCut2 by 24.9 ° C.
[40]
Similar substitu-
tions were performed on Cut190,
[41]
LCC,
[42]
and
ThermoPETase.
[11]
Based on a structural alignment between
TfCut2 and PETase
A
, the equivalent disulfide bridge was
engineered between residues N233 and S282. The triple mutant
PET
ACC
displayed a cooperative effect on the thermal stability
elevating the melting temperature by another 11.4 ° C (to
64.7 ° C). The increased melting temperature of PETase
ACC
allows
a much higher activity compared to PETase
A
at a reaction
temperature of 50 ° C. The formation of the disulfide bond
between N233C and S282C was confirmed to be present and
fully occupied in the electron density of the Combi-PETase
structure (Supplementary Figure S6C) and the structure of the
PETase
ACC
(PDB accession code 8VEL).
PETase
ACCCET
– Generation 3
Further attempts to improve the thermal stability of our
PETase
ACC
variant by rational design only led to modest
improvements. Individually, the A179C, S136E and S214T (CET)
mutations each increased melting temperature of PETase
ACC
by
ca. 3.2 ° C, 0.9 ° C and 2.1 ° C respectively (Supplementary Ta-
ble S3). However, the effect of these mutations was additive
and the combined mutant PETase
ACCCET
displayed a Tm of
67.8 ° C (Figure 1A, Table 1), sufficient to increase the optimal
reaction temperature to 60 ° C.
The A179C variant fills a hydrophobic cavity in the core of
the enzyme, a strategy that is commonly used to improve the
thermal stability of mesophilic enzymes.
[41]
This effect is
apparent in the density around residue A179C in the crystal
structure of Combi-PETase (Supplementary Figure S6D).
The mutant S136E has a small effect on the thermal stability
of the enzyme as measured by DSF, but it also showed a 1.3-
fold increase in hydrolytic activity compared to our PETase
ACC
variant and was compatible with the other mutations, so it was
retained for future generations. In the crystal structure we do
not see the direct formation of any new salt bridge by the
S136E substitution, so the effect may be due to a transient
intraprotein interaction or to an improvement in enzyme-
solvent interactions.
The S214T variant increased the enzymatic activity by 12 %
(Supplementary Table S3). Both the crystal structure of Combi-
PETase (this work) and of the wild type (PDB 6EQE)
[43]
resolve
the sidechain of residue 214 in three different orientations with
similar occupancies. Molecular dynamics simulations show that
in the wild type, S214 (located in β7-α4 loop) preferably makes
a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of P184, located at the start
of the β6-β7 loop, while the mutation to threonine (T214)
breaks this interaction (Figure 2F and G). This can enhance the
flexibility of the β6-β7 loop and the binding site, explaining the
increased activity of this variant. Both A179C and S214T are
newly discovered mutations, while S136E has been previously
shown present similar beneficial effects on the wild type
sequence.
[44]
PETase
ACCCETN
– Generation 4
In a previous publication we performed an Ancestral Sequence
Reconstruction (ASR) experiment on the wild type PsPETase, in
which identified some ancestor sequences that showed
improved thermostability.
[20]
Continuing from this, we inte-
grated and tested several of the ASR designs into our
PETase
ACCCET
variant (Supplementary Table S4) and identified the
K95N mutation which exhibited a further increase in thermal
stability (Tm = 70.4 ° C) and a 12 % increase in terms of
enzymatic activity. Two directed evolution experiments ren-
dered variants that included the K95N mutation: HOT-PETase
[21]
and PETaseTM,
[43]
(with 21 and 2 mutations respectively).
Combining Machine Learning/AI Mutations to the PETase
ACCCETN
A new variant (FAST-PETase) has recently been developed using
a ML-based enzyme engineering method (MutCompute)
[13]
and
based on the ThermoPETase variant. The authors predicted and
tested 159 mutations and identified three of them (N233K,
R224Q and S121E) that when added to the ThermoPETase
(D186H/R280A) yielded a variant with high activity at an
optimal temperature of 50 ° C. From the FAST-PETase mutations,
the N233K mutant is of particular interest, because introducing
this single point mutation on other homologous PET-degrading
enzymes also produces enzymes with higher degradation rates.

Thus, it appears that this mutation is transferable to related
enzymes. We introduced the N233K mutant into our Combi-
PETase, noting that this mutation would break the engineered
disulfide bridge between residue N233C and S282C. Because it
is difficult to compare the results from the literature given that
the reaction conditions and the substrates often differ,
[21]
we
decided to order, express, purify and test the FAST-PETase
sequence as from the literature but using our activity assay and
substrates.
[13]
The new variant derived from FAST-PETase and
Combi-PETase (namely PETase
AKCETN
) showed a modest Tm
decrease to 67.5 ° C compared to Combi-PETase and a reduction
of 10 ° C of the optimum temperature back to 50 ° C, same as the
FAST-PETase variant. (Figure 1A and 1C, Table 1). The activity of
PETase
AKCETN
at 50 ° C is the same as Combi-PETase at the same
temperature but lower than the Combi-PETase at 60 ° C.
However, the yield of the PETase
AKCETN
variant is much higher
(Figure 1B, Table 1).
Assessing the Enzyme’s Suitability for Industrial Applications
Due to higher activity and protein yields, we evaluated the
suitability of the Combi-PETase and PETase
AKCETN
variants for
industrial applications. For these two variants, we performed
long-term reaction experiments at high temperatures and high
enzyme concentrations, and we also tested the residual activity
of Combi-PETase against a high-crystalline PET substrate.
Figure 3 shows the enzymes’ activity at 50 and 60 ° C for up
to 28 hours using FAST-PETase as a control. While at 50 ° C, all
these enzymes perform similarly after either 2 or 28 hours
(Figure 3A, and Supplementary Figure S4), at 60 ° C Combi-
PETase performs better than PETase
AKCETN
, which in turn is better
than FAST-PETase.
Wild type PsPETase has been noted to show a concentration
inhibition effect when the enzyme’s concentration exceeds
150 nM.
[6]
Although the reason for this inhibition is not fully
understood, this is a problem for industrial applications. Avilan
et al. has shown that it is also present in other mesophilic
enzymes and that it can be improved using protein engineering
to increase the thermal stability, by adding additives to the
reaction (e. g. DMSO), or by modifying the substrate (increasing
the polymer surface area).
[45]
HotPETase, a variant generated by
a directed mutagenesis approach,
[24]
is an example of a highly
thermostable variant that shows reduced inhibition by enzyme
concentration. This effect is also displayed in our Combi-PETase,
where we observe at least a 4-fold increase in the optimal
enzyme concentration for the reaction (to ~800 nM, Figure 3C).
PsPETase has been discovered to naturally break down low
crystalline PET (lc-PET). However, high crystalline PET (hc-PET) is
a prevalent waste product that is difficult to break down by all
known PETases. To determine the effect of the crystallinity of
the substrate on the reaction rate of our Combi-PETase, we
tested the enzyme against both hc-PET (post-consumer Coca-
Cola bottle, ca. 45 % crystallinity)
[46]
and lc-PET (powdered
GoodFellow PET film, amorphous). We measured the degrada-
tion products (TPA and MHET) over 28 hours using UPLC
(Figure 4). As usual for all PET hydrolases, lc-PET is more
susceptible to breakdown by Combi-PETase than hc-PET,
resulting in a total of 29 mM and 19 mM of total released
products respectively. However, this means that the Combi-
PETase retains 65 % of the activity against hc-PET, which is very
high compared to other PETase enzymes.
[19,47]
Indeed, LCC
IGGA
variant retains between 25–35 % activity when reacting with
microparticles (� 250 μm) of 32–35 % crystalline PET.
[20]
Most
PET degrading enzymes also show less than 50 % activity
against PET film substrates with 13–23 % crystallinity.
[17]
Conclusions
We combined different enzyme engineering approaches;
structure-based rational design, ancestral sequence reconstruc-
tion and mutations from AI/machine learning to develop a new
variant of PsPETase. We found the biggest improvements in the
enzyme’s properties from the early generations using a rational-
based design. By the second generation (PETase
ACC
), the melting

temperature was increased by 22 ° C. Further generations also
based on rational design improved the thermostability by
another 4 ° C and the activity by 43 % but further improvements
were difficult. A new mutation based on the ASR method
further improved the enzyme’s stability by another 2 ° C and
increased the activity by 10 %. The SDS-PAGE gel shows that
the amount of soluble Combi-PETase protein was qualitatively
increased with respect to the wild type PsPETase (Figure S8),
while the amount of purified Combi-PETase protein was
increased by 25-fold (Figures S9 and S10). The increased
solubility of Combi-PETase is also reflected in the decrease in
the concentration-dependent inhibition, which means that the
Combi-PETase can be efficiently used at 800 nM concentration
instead of < 150 nM for the wild type PsPETase. Based on AI
methods, the N233K mutation was proposed. Introducing this
mutation to the Combi-PETase variant improved the protein
yields, but it also reduced its thermostability and activity.
Therefore, it was not included in our final variant.
Each technique contributed to the advancement of the
engineered Combi-PETase (PETase
ACCCETN
). We highlight the
importance of applying these approaches simultaneously as
each of them has its strengths and limitations. The biggest
improvements were based on understanding the structure of
the protein, the substrate binding mode, and the mechanism of
action. ASR and AI-based tools were more effective in
predicting the impact of remote mutations on the enzyme‘s
properties, which were challenging to foresee with structure-
based protein engineering. Although we may not fully under-
stand how remote mutations affect the protein‘s biophysics in
detail, their beneficial effects are evident.
Overall, this study demonstrates a successful example of a
combinatorial enzyme engineering experiment, using
structure-, bioinformatics- and AI-based strategies. We have
engineered the Combi-PETase variant to perform better in
terms of protein yields, thermostability, activity, tolerance to
high enzyme concentration and longer reaction times; com-
pared to the wildtype PsPETase and most of the published
PETase enzymes. It is highly active over a range of temperatures
and can hydrolyze not only lc-PET but also hc-PET with high
efficiency. These are all desirable biophysical and biochemical
properties when considering the enzyme for industrial applica-
tions. However, we have not upscaled the process or directly
compared the Combi-PETase under standardized industry-like
conditions against other PETase enzymes as done for other
variants.
[21]
Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification
The engineered variants were synthesized at GenScript (con-
taining a C-terminal His-tag) in a modified expression vector
pET-43.1a (+) from Novagen (Supplementary Figure S1). The
proteins were expressed and purified as previously described. E.
coli BL21-(DE3) was used for expression and induced at OD600
~0.8 by addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The cells were grown
in 0.5 or 1 L TB medium and further incubated for ~18 h at
16 ° C and agitated at 180 rpm. Afterwards, the cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 6,000×g for 10 minutes at 4 ° C
and resuspended in lysis buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % (w/
v) glycerol, 45μg lysozyme, 2 mM MgCl
2
, and 20 mM imidazole)
and lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were harvested at
25’000 g for 25 minutes. The soluble fraction of the variants was
purified on an ÄKTAxpress (GE Healthcare) using a 1 mL HisTrap
FF column (GE Healthcare), followed by automated peak
injection onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 prep grade column
(GE Healthcare). Unbound protein was washed off with IMAC
wash buffer (1× PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 20 mM
imidazole) and the bound proteins were eluted using an IMAC
elution buffer (1x PBS, 350 mM NaCl, 10 % w/v glycerol, 500 mM
imidazole). The proteins were run over a Superdex S200 size
exclusion column with SEC buffer (50 mM bicine, 100 mM NaCl,
pH 9.0), concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO concentrator
(Amicon) and SDS-PAGE was run to assess the protein purity.
Protein concentration was determined by nanodrop using
ProtParam calculated (Expasy) extinction coefficient at
280 nm.
[46]
The protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored in 100 μL aliquots.
Thermostability Measurement
The thermal stability of the purified variants was determined
with differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The protein was
diluted to a concentration of 40 μg/mL in (50 mM bicine,
100 mM NaCl, pH 9.0). 20 μL was pipetted into a 96-well white
PCR plate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and added 0.3 μL 75×
SYPRO orange dye using nano-dispensing robots (Art Robbins
Phoenix). The melting temperature shift was measured using
the FRET channel of a CFX96 qPCR instrument (Bio-rad) from
20–100 ° C. All protein samples were set up in six replicates.

Enzymatic Activity of Engineered PET Hydrolases
The PET degradation reactions were prepared with 90 mg
ground hc-PET particles (< 5 mm) from a Coca-cola bottle or
micronized lc-PET (� 500 μm particles GoodFellow PET film,
amorphous) in a 500 μl buffer (50 mM bicine 100 mM NaCl,
pH 9). The reaction was initiated by adding 500 nM to 1600 nM
enzymes and incubated for 1 to 28 hours at the enzyme’s
optimal temperature and 1000 rpm on an Eppendorf Thermo-
Mixer. To determine the optimal temperature, experiments
between 30–70 ° C were performed. The hydrolysis reactions
were stopped at 95 ° C for 10 minutes and the microplastic was
centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for two minutes. The enzymatic
activity of the designed variants was measured as previously
described.
[23]
10-100 μL of the reaction mixture was pipetted
into a black 96-well plate and the volume was adjusted to
100 μL with bicine buffer. The reaction to produce fluorescent
2-hydroxy terephthalate (HOTP), was initiated by adding 25 μL
of 5 mM EDTA and 25 μL of 5 mM FeSO
4
with a multichannel
pipet. Finally, 25 μL of 2 % H
2
O
2
was added by mixing the
reaction mixture. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was
incubated for 60 min at room temperature before the
fluorescence was measured with a plate reader from CLARIOstar
BMG-Labtech Australia (λ
ex
= 320 nm, and λ
em
= 420 nm). We
interpolated the concentration of TPA based on a calibration
curve of terephthalic acid (TPA) between 0–500 μM. The PET
hydrolase variants were compared to the previous variants as a
reference to determine whether the enzymatic activity has
increased, and experiments were performed in triplicate.
UPLC Analysis of PET Hydrolysis
To determine TPA and MHET concentrations, we employed
Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) using an
Acquity UPLC i-Class equipped with a QDa performance mass
detector (Waters). The chromatogram extraction was conducted
at a wavelength of 254 nm. The UPLC system utilized an
Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle
size). The mobile phases employed were as follows: mobile
phase A consisted of 99.9 % Milli-Q Water + 0.1 % formic acid,
and mobile phase B was composed of 99.9 % Acetonitrile +
0.1 % formic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 0.400 mL/
min, and a sample volume of 1 μL was injected three times for
each analysis. Following sample injection, the mobile phase
composition transitioned from 95 % A to 100 % B over a 4.50-
minute interval and remained at 100 % B for 1 minute.
Subsequently, it was changed back to 95 % A over 0.5 minutes
and held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. To
interpolate the concentrations of TPA and MHET, we prepared
calibration curves ranging from 0 to 500 μM by utilising the
mass of each compound.
Protein Crystallisation and Structure Determination
Crystals of the PETase variants were grown by vapour diffusion
in MRC 2 sitting-drop plates (Swissci) setting up drops at a 1 : 1
ratio with 150 nl of protein and 150 nl of mother liquor using
the Phoenix Crystal (Art Robbins) liquid handling platform with
crystallisation conditions described in Supplementary Table S8.
Crystals grew after a couple of days and prior to flash cooling in
liquid nitrogen were cryoprotected with a final concentration of
15 % glycerol added to the reservoir before overlaying onto the
drop. Diffraction experiments were carried out at the Australian
Synchrotron MX2 beamline
[48]
under nitrogen vapor at 100K
and a wavelength of 0.974 Å. Data reduction was carried out
with XDS
[48]
for indexing and integration followed by scaling
and merging with Aimless.
[49]
Automated implementation of the
same programs was utilised with autoPROC.
[50]
Molecular
replacement was carried out with Phaser
[51]
via a model derived
from the PDB ID 6EQE.
[43]
The model was iteratively built and
refined with Coot 0.8.9
[51]
and Refmac 5.7
[52]
(Combi-PETase/
PETase
ACCCETN
) via the CCP4i2 user interface,
[53]

(PETase

),
[54]
or autoBUSTER (PETase
ACCC
and PETase
ACCE
).
[55]
Statistics for structure solution and refinement are presented in
Supplementary Table S7.
Protein Modelling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations
A model of the 8mer-PET substrate in complex with the wild
type PsPETase enzyme was build using the 6EQE model as
starting structure.
[43]
The substrate was modelled in a step-wise
manner. First, a flexible molecule of Mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET) was docked in the active
site (using residue S160 as the centre of the box). Then, one by
one, new moieties of MHET were added to both ends of the
first molecule until the 8mer-PET substrate was finished. At
each step, a 1μs molecular dynamics simulation was performed
to relax the system, applying a distance harmonic constraint
between the carbonyl oxygen atom of the first molecule
docked and the backbone nitrogen atoms of residues Y87 and
M161 (the residues defining the tetrahedral oxoanionic binding
site) to ensure that the substrate remained in the active site.
Finally, 1μs MD simulation of the 8mer-PET substrate was
performed without any constraint. Alignment of the modelled
complex with the crystal structure of PsPETase in complex with
MHET (PDB 7XTW)
[56]
shows very good agreement in the
docking pose of the substrate. The docking of the first MHET
molecule was performed using AutoDock4 and the molecular
dynamics simulations were performed using the CUDA version
of AMBER20.
[57,58,59,60]
The force field used for the protein was
ff14SB
[61]
and the substrate was modelled using the gaff2
forcefield, reducing the substrate-substrate van-der-Waals self-
interactions by 50 % to avoid aggregation. The system was
solvated in a TIP3P water model
[62]
using periodic boundary
conditions with a 12 Å distance from the protein. An 80 mM
concentration of NaCl was used ensuring charge neutrality of
the system. van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were
capped at 12 Å using a smooth potential while a PM3

was used to describe the long-range electro-
static interactions. The initial structure was relaxed using an
energy minimization protocol using a steepest-descent and a
Newton-Raphson algorithms. The temperature was increased to
300K in a 15 ns MD simulation in the NPT ensemble and then
the production run performed in the NVT ensemble coupling
the system to a thermostat. All molecular dynamics simulations
were performed using a timestep of 2 fs, with a constraint on
the hydrogen atoms. The MD simulations of the wild type
enzyme in complex with the 8mer-PET substrate were extended
for 1μs. The MD simulations of the mutants to produce
Figure S3 and of Combi-PETase to produce Figure 2F   H were
extended for 2μs. The analysis of the MD simulations was
performed using AMBER-Tools, VMD
[64]
and in-house scripts.
Mutations based on the Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction
bioinformatics approach were chosen from our previous work
[23]
while AI-based mutations were based on published work.
