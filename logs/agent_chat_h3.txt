PETase variants have been engineered to address the twin challenges of catalytic efficiency and operational robustness that limit the practical use of PET‑degrading enzymes. The most advanced of these is FAST‑PETase, a rationally designed mutant that combines a set of surface‑optimizing substitutions (notably S245R) with a core scaffold that tolerates high temperatures and alkaline pH. In a series of kinetic assays, FAST‑PETase released PET monomers from pretreated water‑bottle films at 50 °C and pH 8.0, achieving complete degradation of a large, untreated PET container within 48 h when the enzyme was replenished every 22 h [2]. The enzyme retains activity across a broad temperature window, with measurable monomer release at 60 °C and 72 °C, and its stability profile shows little loss of activity after 24 h at 50 °C, indicating a robust thermal tolerance that surpasses the wild‑type enzyme and many other engineered variants [2].

ThermoPETase, another engineered PETase, was developed to operate at even higher temperatures. Its activity profile peaks at 72 °C, a temperature at which the wild‑type enzyme is essentially inactive. ThermoPETase’s kinetic parameters (k_cat and K_M) have been reported for a range of PET substrates, and the enzyme shows a marked improvement in catalytic efficiency compared to the wild type, especially on low‑crystallinity PET films [2]. However, the structural basis for its thermostability remains largely inferred from sequence homology and mutagenesis data rather than high‑resolution structures.

DuraPETase represents a different strategy, focusing on increasing the overall rigidity of the protein scaffold. The canonical DuraPETase carries the quadruple mutation N233C/S282C/H214S/S245R, which introduces disulfide bonds (N233C/S282C) to lock the protein in a more rigid conformation, modulates the flexibility of the W185 region (H214S), and optimizes surface charge (S245R) to improve solubility and stability [1]. A further engineered variant, DuraPETase‑4M (N233C/S282C/H214S/S245R), was designed to enhance rigidity even further, and it shows activity at 72 °C, comparable to ThermoPETase, while maintaining a high catalytic rate on pretreated PET films [2]. An additional mutation, E0552S, has been reported in some DuraPETase constructs, though its functional impact is not yet fully characterized.

Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps persist. First, the lack of crystal or cryo‑EM structures for the engineered variants limits our ability to rationally design further improvements; the current understanding of how the introduced mutations alter the active‑site geometry and dynamics is largely speculative. Second, while activity data exist for a handful of PET substrates, the substrate scope—particularly for highly crystalline or mixed‑polymer plastics—is not well defined. Third, kinetic parameters (k_cat, K_M, k_cat/K_M) are reported for a limited set of conditions, and the influence of pH, ionic strength, and the presence of additives on enzyme performance remains underexplored. Finally, the long‑term stability of these enzymes under industrially relevant conditions (continuous operation, presence of inhibitors, or in complex feedstocks) has not been systematically assessed.

To address these limitations, a two‑pronged approach combining computational modeling and experimental validation is recommended. On the computational side, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FAST‑PETase, ThermoPETase, and DuraPETase at elevated temperatures can reveal the dynamic behavior of the active site and the stability of engineered disulfide bonds. Coupling MD with quantum‑mechanical/molecular‑mechanical (QM/MM) calculations will allow us to probe the reaction mechanism and identify rate‑limiting steps, guiding the design of mutations that lower activation barriers. Machine‑learning models trained on existing mutagenesis data could predict beneficial substitutions, especially in regions that are currently underexplored, such as the loop surrounding the catalytic triad or the surface patches that influence aggregation.

Experimentally, high‑throughput directed evolution using error‑prone PCR or DNA shuffling, coupled with microfluidic screening for PET hydrolysis (e.g., using fluorescently labeled PET analogs), would rapidly generate libraries enriched for improved thermostability and activity. Parallel to this, structural studies—X‑ray crystallography or cryo‑EM—of the most promising variants will provide atomic‑resolution insights into the effects of the engineered mutations. Kinetic assays should be expanded to include a broader range of PET crystallinities, chain lengths, and mixed‑polymer substrates, and to systematically vary pH and ionic strength to map the operational window of each enzyme. Finally, long‑term stability tests, such as continuous‑flow reactor assays and repeated batch cycles, will establish the practical durability of the enzymes under conditions that mimic industrial recycling processes.

By integrating these computational and experimental strategies, we can close the current knowledge gaps, accelerate the development of PETases that combine high catalytic efficiency with robust stability, and ultimately bring enzymatic PET recycling closer to commercial viability.
