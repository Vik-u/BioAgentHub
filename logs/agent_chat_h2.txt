The recent literature paints a picture of a rapidly evolving toolbox for PET depolymerisation, centred on a handful of engineered hydrolases that have been benchmarked against the wild‑type PETase from *Ideonella sakaiensis*. FAST‑PETase, a multi‑mutant construct (S121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A) that also harbours the D238C, S283C and N246M substitutions, has emerged as the most active variant under laboratory conditions. In a side‑by‑side comparison with WT PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase and the highly thermostable LCCICCM, FAST‑PETase released the largest amount of monomers from pre‑treated PET bottles at 50 °C (≈ 70 mM in 24 h) and achieved complete degradation of a large, untreated PET container at the same temperature, a feat not matched by the other enzymes in the same assay [1]. The enzyme’s pH optimum is 8.0, and it retains activity up to 72 °C, although its catalytic efficiency drops markedly below 30 °C, a limitation that is shared with the DuraPETase scaffold. DuraPETase itself, which carries the D238C and S283C mutations, shows modest activity at mild temperatures (30–50 °C) but gains a significant boost at 55–60 °C, particularly in the N233K variant that is the most thermostable PETase reported to date [1]. LC‑Cutinase (LCC), a metagenome‑derived cutinase, remains the gold standard for amorphous PET degradation; its crystal structure and thermodynamic stability have been characterised in detail, and a thermostable variant (LCCICCG) has been engineered to improve activity on PET, though its performance on crystalline PET remains limited [2, 3].

Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps persist. First, the kinetic parameters (k_cat, K_M) of FAST‑PETase and DuraPETase on both amorphous and crystalline PET substrates are not yet quantified, making it difficult to compare catalytic efficiencies across enzymes. Second, the structural basis for the enhanced thermostability of FAST‑PETase is unclear, as no crystal or cryo‑EM structure has been reported for this mutant. Third, the synergistic potential of combining FAST‑PETase with LC‑Cutinase or other PET‑degrading enzymes has not been systematically explored, nor has the effect of plastic additives, salts, or solvents on enzyme stability been assessed. Finally, the long‑term operational stability and recyclability of these enzymes under industrially relevant conditions remain untested.

To address these gaps, a two‑pronged approach combining computational design and high‑throughput experimentation is recommended. Computationally, homology modelling of FAST‑PETase followed by extensive molecular dynamics simulations at 50–70 °C can identify flexible loops and potential destabilising interactions that could be targeted for further stabilisation. Free‑energy perturbation calculations on the D238C, S283C and N246M mutations will quantify their contributions to binding and catalysis, guiding the design of additional stabilising or activity‑enhancing mutations. Machine‑learning models trained on existing PETase variants could predict beneficial substitutions, while alanine‑scanning mutagenesis in silico can highlight residues critical for substrate binding. Experimentally, a focused library of single‑ and combinatorial mutants around the identified hotspots should be generated via site‑directed mutagenesis and screened using a fluorescence‑based PET analogue assay that allows rapid throughput. Parallel kinetic assays on amorphous and crystalline PET films at 30–70 °C and pH 6.5–8.5 will yield k_cat and K_M values, enabling a rigorous comparison of catalytic efficiencies. Structural studies—X‑ray crystallography or cryo‑EM—of the most promising mutants will confirm the predicted stabilising interactions and provide a template for further rational design. Finally, co‑incubation experiments combining FAST‑PETase with LC‑Cutinase (or its thermostable variants) on mixed‑crystallinity PET substrates will reveal any synergistic effects, while enzyme immobilisation on solid supports could be tested to assess recyclability and operational stability over multiple cycles.

By integrating these computational and experimental strategies, the field can move beyond the current benchmark of high monomer release rates toward a comprehensive understanding of enzyme performance, stability, and scalability, ultimately paving the way for industrial deployment of PET‑degrading biocatalysts.
