The current landscape of PET‑degrading enzymes is dominated by a handful of engineered variants that have been optimized for either higher catalytic turnover or improved thermostability, yet the field still grapples with a number of fundamental limitations. The wild‑type PETase from *Ideonella sakaiensis* (Is PETase) is a benchmark for mild‑condition activity, but its melting temperature (Tm ≈ 49 °C) and modest catalytic efficiency restrict its practical use. Several mutants have been reported that push the temperature ceiling upward: HotPETase (HP) shows robust activity at 60 °C and a pH optimum near 9.7, while ThermoPETase and DuraPETase raise the Tm to 67 °C and 72 °C, respectively, by introducing stabilizing mutations such as E0552S and N233K. FAST‑PETase, a more recent design, surprisingly achieves its best performance at 50 °C, releasing twice as many terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2‑hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) monomers in 24 h compared to ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, despite operating far below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PET (65–75 °C). This temperature‑specific activity suggests that FAST‑PETase has adapted to a different kinetic regime, perhaps by optimizing substrate binding at lower thermal motion.

The activity data for these enzymes are largely derived from assays on amorphous PET films (e.g., Goodfellow Gf‑PET) and pretreated PET bottles, with monomer release quantified by HPLC or mass spectrometry. HotPETase has been further engineered by fusing a carbohydrate‑binding module (CBM) from *Bacillus anthracis* to its C‑terminus (HLCB), which enhances degradation of PET by increasing substrate affinity. LCC and its engineered variants (e.g., LCC ICCG, LCC F243I/D238C/S283C) and BhrPETase (94 % identical to LCC) also demonstrate high activity, underscoring the value of sequence homology as a starting point for engineering.

Despite these advances, several gaps remain. First, most engineered PETases still exhibit a trade‑off between thermostability and activity: DuraPETase, for instance, is highly stable but shows low activity at mild temperatures (30–50 °C), only improving at 55–60 °C. FAST‑PETase, conversely, is highly active at 50 °C but its performance drops sharply at higher temperatures, limiting its utility for processes that operate near Tg. Second, the majority of studies focus on single‑plastic substrates; the performance of these enzymes on mixed‑plastic waste streams, which contain additives, dyes, and polymer blends, is largely unexplored. Third, kinetic parameters (kcat, Km) are rarely reported for the engineered variants, making it difficult to compare catalytic efficiencies across studies. Fourth, structural data for many mutants are incomplete; while crystal structures exist for WT PETase and some mutants, the dynamic behavior of these enzymes at elevated temperatures remains poorly understood.

To address these limitations, a coordinated computational–experimental strategy is warranted. On the computational side, deep learning models trained on large PETase homolog databases (≈ 26 000 sequences) can predict mutation probabilities that preserve evolutionary viability while enhancing stability or activity, as demonstrated in the design of HotPETase. Extending this approach, one could employ AlphaFold‑2 or RoseTTAFold to generate high‑confidence structural models of mutant enzymes, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at a range of temperatures to probe the stability of the active site and the dynamics of substrate binding loops. MD data can feed into Rosetta or FoldX to identify surface mutations that increase thermostability without compromising catalytic residues. Additionally, computational alanine scanning and free‑energy perturbation calculations could pinpoint residues that contribute most to substrate affinity at low temperatures, guiding the design of variants that retain FAST‑PETase‑like activity at higher temperatures.

Experimentally, a high‑throughput screening platform is essential. Microfluidic droplet assays that couple PET hydrolysis to a fluorescent reporter (e.g., a dye that reacts with released TPA) would allow rapid evaluation of thousands of variants generated by error‑prone PCR or site‑saturation mutagenesis. Coupling this with a thermostable expression host (e.g., *Thermus thermophilus* or engineered *E. coli* strains) would enable screening directly at elevated temperatures, ensuring that selected mutants are both active and stable. Parallel kinetic assays using purified enzymes and defined PET substrates (amorphous films, pretreated bottles, cryPET) would yield kcat and Km values, facilitating quantitative comparisons. Thermostability can be assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) to confirm Tm shifts predicted by computational models.

Beyond single‑enzyme optimization, exploring enzyme cocktails that combine the strengths of different variants could overcome the activity–stability trade‑off. For instance, a mixture of FAST‑PETase (high activity at 50 °C) and DuraPETase (high stability at 70 °C) might provide robust degradation across a broader temperature window. Immobilizing enzymes on solid supports or incorporating them into polymer‑degrading bioreactors could further enhance process stability and recyclability. Finally, systematic testing on real‑world PET waste, including multilayered packaging and mixed‑plastic streams, will reveal the practical limits of current enzymes and highlight the need for further engineering to tolerate additives and dyes.

In summary, while engineered PETases such as HotPETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, and FAST‑PETase have pushed the boundaries of activity and stability, the field still lacks a comprehensive understanding of how to simultaneously maximize both properties across the full temperature range relevant to industrial recycling. By integrating advanced machine‑learning predictions, MD‑guided rational design, high‑throughput screening, and detailed kinetic and thermostability assays, we can systematically close these gaps and move toward robust, scalable enzymatic PET recycling solutions.
