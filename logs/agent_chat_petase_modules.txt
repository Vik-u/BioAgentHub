PETases have emerged as the cornerstone of biocatalytic PET valorization, yet the field remains fragmented between sequence‐based catalogues and functional characterisations.  The most widely studied wild‑type enzyme, IsPETase, was isolated from *Ideonella sakaiensis* and displays appreciable activity at modest temperatures (≈30 °C) with a relatively low melting point, making it attractive for mild‑condition recycling but limiting its industrial robustness [2].  Engineered variants have been generated to address this limitation.  HotPETase, a thermostable mutant, retains high activity at 40 °C and can hydrolyse 90 % of 20 kg of PET waste in a single batch, illustrating the power of directed evolution to extend the usable temperature window [3].  ThermoPETase, engineered by introducing the E0552S mutation, shows an optimal activity around 72 °C and can degrade pretreated PET films at temperatures up to 72 °C, outperforming the wild‑type enzyme in high‑temperature regimes [5].  DuraPETase, another engineered scaffold, exhibits low activity at mild temperatures but gains substantial activity at 55–60 °C, especially in the N233K mutant, underscoring the trade‑off between catalytic efficiency and thermostability [5].  FAST‑PETase, a recent variant (S121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A), has been benchmarked against WT PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC, and ICCM across a temperature range of 50–72 °C, revealing superior performance at elevated temperatures and a broader operational window [5].

Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps persist.  First, the mechanistic basis for the enhanced thermostability of ThermoPETase and FAST‑PETase remains poorly understood; structural data are limited to homology models, and no high‑resolution crystal structures exist for these mutants.  Second, the influence of PET crystallinity and surface glass transition temperature (Tg ≈ 40–45 °C in water) on enzyme activity is not systematically quantified across variants, leaving uncertainty about how each enzyme will perform on real‑world PET streams with heterogeneous crystallinity.  Third, the current activity database (PANDA) contains functional data for 99 natural PETases and one engineered enzyme (LCC_ICCG), but systematic kinetic parameters (k_cat, K_M) for the engineered variants are sparse, hindering quantitative comparison and rational design.  Finally, the interplay between enzyme surface charge, hydrophobicity, and substrate binding in the context of PET’s hydrophobic surface is not fully mapped, limiting our ability to predict or engineer improved binding affinity.

To bridge these gaps, a two‑pronged approach combining computational modelling and targeted experimentation is recommended.  Computationally, high‑resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the wild‑type and engineered PETases in explicit water and in the presence of PET oligomer models should be performed to capture conformational dynamics, identify stabilising interactions introduced by mutations, and map the active‑site accessibility at different temperatures.  Enhanced sampling techniques (e.g., replica‑exchange MD) can probe the unfolding pathways of ThermoPETase and FAST‑PETase, revealing the energetic contributions of key residues such as E0552S, N233K, and the FAST‑PETase quintuple mutation set.  Parallel in silico docking of PET surface fragments of varying crystallinity can predict binding modes and estimate the free‑energy landscape of substrate approach, guiding the design of surface‑loop mutations to improve hydrophobic interactions.  Machine‑learning models trained on the PANDA dataset, augmented with the newly generated kinetic parameters, could then predict activity scores for unexplored variants, prioritising candidates for experimental validation.

Experimentally, a systematic kinetic characterisation of all engineered PETases should be undertaken using a standardized assay (e.g., pH‑stat or HPLC‑based monomer quantification) across a temperature gradient (30–80 °C) and a range of PET substrates differing in crystallinity and surface area.  Determining k_cat and K_M values will enable direct comparison of catalytic efficiencies and allow the calculation of activation energies, providing insight into the temperature dependence of each variant.  Structural studies should be pursued: X‑ray crystallography or cryo‑EM of ThermoPETase, FAST‑PETase, and DuraPETase (both wild‑type and N233K) will validate the MD predictions and reveal the precise arrangement of stabilising salt bridges, hydrogen‑bond networks, and hydrophobic cores.  Additionally, site‑directed mutagenesis of residues identified by MD as critical for thermostability (e.g., residues forming new salt bridges or packing interactions) can be performed to test their contribution to activity and stability, closing the loop between computational prediction and empirical validation.

Finally, integrating these data into an expanded, publicly accessible database that includes kinetic parameters, structural coordinates, and detailed substrate characterisation will provide the community with a robust platform for rational PETase engineering.  Such a resource would enable the systematic exploration of the enzyme–substrate interface, facilitate the design of next‑generation PETases with tailored temperature profiles and substrate specificities, and ultimately accelerate the deployment of biocatalytic PET recycling at industrial scales.
