confirm expected fluorescence intensity.  \n   - **Next Step Trigger**: Libraries passed QC and ready for sequencing run.  \n   - **Safety**: Handle sequencing reagents with care; avoid exposure to hazardous chemicals.\n\n10. **Data integration and design iteration**  \n    - **Goal**: Combine qPCR, sequencing, and colony‑growth data to calculate editing efficiency and inform the next design cycle.  \n    - **Reagents/Volumes**: None (computational step).  \n    - **Instruments**: **Computational pipeline** (Python/R scripts) – not a lab instrument but essential for data handling.  \n    - **Parameters**: N/A.  \n    - **Actions**: Import Ct values, sequencing read counts, and colony counts into the pipeline; compute % edited, msDNA yield, and growth metrics.  \n    - **QC/Observations**: Generate plots of editing efficiency vs. msDNA concentration; identify outliers.  \n    - **Next Step Trigger**: Decision point for promoter strength, msDNA length, or RT variant selection.  \n    - **Safety**: Ensure all data are stored on secure servers; comply with data‑privacy regulations.\n\n---\n\n## Computational Workflow\n\n1. **In silico design of msDNA and RT cassette**  \n   - Use a primer‑design tool to create a 200‑bp msDNA template with homology arms flanking the target locus.  \n   - Simulate promoter induction kinetics (IPTG/arabinoside) to predict RT expression levels.  \n   - Output: FASTA files for oligo synthesis and a plasmid map for assembly.\n\n2. **Modeling of retron‑mediated recombination**  \n   - Input: msDNA length, RT catalytic parameters, and target locus sequence.  \n   - Run a Monte‑Carlo simulation to estimate recombination frequency under the chosen induction conditions.  \n   - Output: Expected % edited colonies and msDNA copy number per cell.\n\n3. **Analysis of qPCR data**  \n   - Import Ct values from QuantStudio 7 Pro into a spreadsheet.  \n   - Calculate ΔCt relative to a housekeeping gene (e.g., 16S rRNA).  \n   - Convert ΔCt to msDNA copy number using a standard curve generated from known msDNA concentrations.\n\n4. **Sequencing data processing**  \n   - Use a FASTQ‑to‑variant pipeline (e.g., BWA‑MEM + SAMtools) to align amplicon reads to the reference genome.  \n   - Call variants with a minimum depth of 30× and a variant allele frequency threshold of 5 %.  \n   - Output: Table of edited vs. unedited reads per sample.\n\n5. **Statistical evaluation and design feedback**  \n   - Compute the proportion of edited colonies per plate.  \n   - Correlate msDNA copy number with editing efficiency to identify limiting steps.  \n   - Generate a recommendation list: adjust msDNA length, promoter strength, or RT variant for the next experimental cycle.  \n\n---"
