It has also been suggested that as the\nsubstrate of this reaction is non-aqueous, classical Michaelis–\nMenten kinetics cannot be used to relate reaction rates to\ncalculated energy barriers.\n[25]\nThese energy barriers calculated in this work are suitably\nlow to suggest that none of the hydrolysis steps catalysed by Is-\nPETase constitute its rate-limiting step. By a process of\nelimination, this leaves either substrate binding or product\nrelease as candidates for the rate limiting step. This is consistent\nwith the findings from site-directed mutagenesis studies, where\nthe largest improvements in enzyme activity were obtained\nthrough mutations that are thought to affect binding.\nIn several calculation steps starting from six MD snapshots,\nthe product geometry (Figure 2) was not found to be stable,\ninstead forming an alternate product state aPS (Figure 7). The\ncarboxylic moiety of the ligand was deprotonated, having\ntransferred to the side-chain oxygen of S131 causing the ɛ-\nnitrogen on H208 and the carboxyl of D177 to be protonated.\nThe energy of this state was calculated to be up to\n\u0000 137.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nmore stable relative to the geometry of\nintermediate 4 that preceded it (Figure 5). Subsequent MD\nsimulations of the aPS state revealed that the deprotonated\nproduct forms strong hydrogen bonds with the active site\nresidues (Figure 6). This caused the ligand to persist in the\nactive site for up to 1 ns. This tendency for the product to\ndeprotonate while inside the active site might thus result in a\nsubstantial energy barrier in the product release step of the\nreaction. This would significantly hinder the enzyme’s catalytic\nefficiency."

      "text": "mechanical (QM) data with an emphasis on transition-state regimes, to simulate the complete\ncatalytic cycle of the PETase enzyme over 400 ps of simulation time. Our simulations capture\nkey proton transfer events throughout the reaction, consistent with mechanisms reported in\nprevious studies. 19–26 Distance analysis underscores the critical role of the backbone amide\nnitrogens of Y95 and M166, which function as the \"oxyanion hole\" by forming hydrogen\nbonds that stabilize the carbonyl oxygen atom throughout the reaction.\nThe free energy analysis provides quantitative insights into the reaction activation ener-\ngies. Our simulations estimate free energy barriers of 22 and 20 kcal/mol for the acylation\nand deacylation steps, respectively, following the lower bound path. These values are rela-\ntively close to the estimated experimental value of 18.7 kcal/mol 2,24 and the calculated value\nof 21.1 kcal/mol by Boneta et al. 24 Nevertheless, we acknowledge several limitations aﬀect-\ning the accuracy of the free energy barrier estimation. The large error bars primarily stem\nfrom the relatively short simulation time, necessitating longer simulations for QuantaMind to\nsample suﬃcient conﬁgurations and converge the mean force. Additionally, in the acylation\nstep, the nucleophilic attack and C-O bond cleavage may proceed in a concerted rather than\nsequential fashion. 19 Thus, a two-dimensional distance scan is required to construct the full\npotential energy surface and determine the lowest energy path. A similar approach applies\nto the deacylation reaction’s two sub-steps.\nFinally, as a DL-based model, QuantaMind relies heavily on its training data. While\nthe training of QuantaMind signiﬁcantly considers transition-state geometries, 34 additional\ntraining data would be beneﬁcial, particularly for estimating energy barriers. The transition-\nstate structures sampled in this work provide a valuable source of geometries that can be\nfurther optimized at the DFT level. These calculations can serve as additional training data\nto iteratively enhance the QuantaMind model, improving its accuracy and applicability to\nserine hydrolase-related biomolecular systems.\n12\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Beyond\nPETase, this framework can be readily extended to a wide range of enzyme classes. Looking\nforward, we envision that this MLFF-based methodology will not only complement but\nultimately supersede traditional QM/MM approaches, eliminating the need for artiﬁcial\nsystem partitioning while retaining quantum-level accuracy at accessible computational cost.\nWith continued reﬁnement, QuantaMind MD has the potential to establish a new paradigm\nfor studying enzymatic catalysis and biomolecular reactivity."
