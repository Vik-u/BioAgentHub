      "text": "In the past few years, numerous publications dealing with the\ndiscovery and engineering of PET hydrolases have been\nreleased. To improve the activity and thermostability of such\nPETases, various concepts of protein engineering were\nimplemented, such as rational design,\n13\ndirected evolution,\n11\nor AI-assisted in silico protein design.\n14\nThe field has greatly\nbenefited from these studies, since they have opened a plethora\nof new possible avenues for enzymatic PET recycling.\nUnfortunately, a thorough comparison of enzyme performance\nremains problematic since no international scientific consensus\nfor the evaluation of PET hydrolase performance has emerged.\nThe nature and properties of the substrates used can differ as\nwell as reaction conditions, analytical methods, and more\nimportantly readout parameters. In our study, we targeted over\n90% (ideally 95%) PET depolymerization from the perspective\nof a viable large-scale biotechnological process development.\nWe postulated that studies solely relying on enzyme specific\nactivity as readouts were unable to assess the true applicability\nof the enzymes for industrial deployment. One of the reasons is\nvery likely the number of new constraints to be considered on\na larger scale. As a first step, we have therefore performed a\nstandardized small-scale PET depolymerization study of four\nengineered PET hydrolases (e.g., FAST-PETase,\n14\nHotPE-\nTase,\n11\nPES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y 16\n, and LCC\nICCG 13\n) to evaluate their\noptimal temperature condition. Such standardization com-\nprised the use of cryo-ground amorphous commercial\nGoodfellow film with known particle size distribution, a fixed\nenzyme/substrate ratio (mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\n), and a fixed polymer\nconcentration (g\nPET\nL\n−1\n). Enzymes’ performances were\nevaluated at such small scale by determining standardized\nparameters such as final PET conversion/terephthalic acid\nformed after a given time and enzyme-specific activity values\n(μmol\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\nor g\nTPAeq\nh\n−1\nmg\nenzyme\n−1\n) as\nrecommended elsewhere.\n37\nThen, a thorough comparison of\nthe four PET hydrolases was performed in bioreactors using\nhigh concentrations of pretreated postconsumer PET waste\nmaterial (165 and 200 g\nPET\nkg\n−1\n) to mimic the conditions of\nan industrial process. Parameters such as the average and\nmaximum productivity (expressed in g\nTPAeq\nL\n−1\nh\n−1\n), the PET\nconversion/terephthalic acid formed after a given time, and the\npurity of the products (e.g., TPA, MHET) were carefully\nassessed. We find that a typical weakness of the PET degrading\nenzymes is the deterioration of the activity over a long−time\nreaction that is in turn required to achieve 100% substrate\nconversion. FAST-PETase showed convincing performances in\nterms of specific activities at both reactor scales, but the\nkinetics of PET conversion in the reactor dramatically slowed\ndown to reach less than 20% at 24 h. This observation appears\nto be in-line with the previous study where FAST-PETase\nenabled a 90% PET depolymerization from a 45 g\nPET\nL\n−1\nsolution (e.g., amorphized PET bottle flakes) after 14 days at\n50 °C but necessitating a daily replenishing of fresh enzyme\nTable 2.

Likewise, Bell et al. have\nshown a substantial decrease in PET conversion after 5 h of\nreaction using HotPETase correlated to enzyme deactivation\nbut not to product inhibition or PET.\n11\nComparatively, PES-\nH1\nL92F/Q94Y\nand LCC\nICCG\nappeared more stable over time in\nreactor conditions, and near-complete PET conversions\n(∼98%) were attained within 48 and 24 h, respectively, at\n16.5% PET loading (81 and 98% PET conversion at 20% PET\nloading, respectively). LCC\nICCG\nand PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nthus\nappear as good candidates for the deployment of an enzyme-\nbased-PET-depolymerization process.\nThe behavior of PES-H1\nL92F/Q94Y\nin the reactor is intriguing.\nIts T\nm\nis lower than that of HotPETase (77.6 and 80.7,\nrespectively) and in small reactors, at low PET concentration,\nand in nonsaturating enzyme conditions, the reaction stops\nrapidly at less than 12% conversion. This contradiction cannot\nbe simply explained by low stability or inhibition by the\nproducts. Further investigations are necessary to solve this\nmystery.\nSince the last study describing LCC\nICCG\nperformance,\n13\nreaction conditions have been largely improved in this work.\nWhile 95% PET conversion was previously obtained after 24 h\nusing 3 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\nat 72 °C,\n13\n98% PET conversion was\nobtained here by introducing 1 mg\nenzyme\ng\nPET\n−1\nat 68 °C.\nReducing the temperature of the reaction by 4 °C enabled the\nPET recrystallization kinetics to be reduced, which favors\nobtaining high conversion. The positive outcome was a\nreduction of the amount of enzyme by a factor of 3 while\nincreasing the final PET conversion in the same time frame\nand consequently decreasing the cost of waste treatment. Such\nenzyme performance is meeting one of the bottlenecks\ndescribed in a comprehensive LCA study of enzymatic\nrecycling of PET, highlighting the need to achieve conversions\ngreater than 90% at high PET concentrations to minimize\npostreaction waste.\n24,28\nFinally, TPA and EG monomers are\nexclusively produced without the accumulation of MHET in\nthe solution, simplifying the purification scheme of the\nproducts.\nWe believe that our study of PET hydrolases will contribute\nto finding a consensus on the methods used and key\nparameters to consider when performing a large-scale PET\ndepolymerization. Such a consensus is necessary for the\ndeployment of the first generation of enzymatic PET recycling\nprocesses at an industrial scale. We also believe that this field\nwill further benefit from new technologies to emerge as well as\nnew superior enzymes being able, for instance, to perform\nefficient degradation of semicrystalline PET to minimize the\nPET pretreatment steps as underlined in a previous study.\n28\nUltimately, new acid-tolerant PET hydrolases able to perform\nefficient PET depolymerization with no (or a minimal) need of\nsoda for pH regulation would also be of great interest to\nfurther strengthen the concept of enzymatic PET hydrolysis in\nthe frame of a circular economy.\n■"

      "text": "PET-hydrolyzing enzymes are widely distributed, indicat-\ning that PET, particularly amorphous PET, can be hydro -\nlyzed in ecosystems at extremely low rates. However, it \nis important to avoid creating an illusion for the public or \noverestimating its role, as biodegradation in the ecosystem, \neven if possible, cannot match the amount of PET released \ninto the environment. The most crucial aspect is to collect \nand recycle PET waste as much as possible. Enzymatic PET \nhydrolysis is a promising technology for ecofriendly PET \nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404 \n Page 13 of 18 404\nrecycling. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibil-\nity of industrial PET biorecycling using PET hydrolases. \nCurrently, uncountable PET-hydrolyzing enzymes have \nbeen identified, including type I and type II with varia-\ntions. However, none of the wild-type enzymes are suitable \nfor industrial applications. To achieve a practical level for \nindustrial biorecycling, enzymes have been mutationally \nimproved, with PET waste pretreatment. Variants created \nfrom the representative PET hydrolases and their muta-\ntional strategies are listed in Table S4 and S5. Currently, \nno enzyme can meet the requirements for industrialization \nwithout pretreatment of PET waste, such as amorphization \nand micronization. This is because enzyme efficiency highly \ndepends on the ratio of PET dimensions per enzyme, and the \ndegradability of crystalline PET is significantly lower than \namorphous PET. PET waste, including polyolefins, PET, \nand polystyrene, is often discarded as plastic trash without \nbeing sorted by type, except for transparent water bottles, \nwhich are collected and recycled. The classification of PET \nwaste based on its crystallinity grade, whether amorphous or \ncrystalline, is practically impossible. Therefore, biorecycling \nrequires a balance between improving enzymes and imple-\nmenting economical and ecofriendly pretreatments. Some \nenzymes performed better on untreated or crystalline PET \nwaste than  LCCICCG , which is still considered as the standard \nPET hydrolase. However, the degradation of crystalline PET \nwas much lower than amorphous PET, leaving behind unde-\ncomposed remnants, mostly crystalline parts. PET stored at \ntemperatures near Tg undergoes physical aging (Hutchinson \n1995). When post-consumer PET waste was kept at 70 °C, \nits crystallinity gradually increased and reached a threshold \nof 20% for the upper limit of biodegradation in approxi-\nmately 10 h (Pfaff et al. 2022). However, after being kept at \n65 °C for 24 h, there was almost no increase in crystallin-\nity (Tournier et al. 2020). The amorphous fraction of PET \nundergoes physical aging at 70 °C, gradually transforming \ninto rigid amorphous fraction adjacent to the crystalline \nfraction. This transformation results in limited accessibility \nto enzymatic hydrolysis, as noted by Wei et al. (2019a). The \nreaction temperature of  LCCICCG  was re-optimized from 72 \nto 68 °C, possibly due to these risks, as suggested by Arnal \net al. (2023). TurboPETase displayed better performance at \n65 °C than  LCCICCG  (Cui et al. 2024) on a laboratory scale \n(in a 7.5 L bioreactor). The operational temperature for PET \nhydrolases must be lower than 68 °C. On the other hand, a \nnew LCC variant, LCC-A2 suggested the best performance \nat 78 °C in a shorter time than  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase \n(Zheng et al. 2024). Further work is needed to evaluate them \nscientifically and practically. Erickson et al. (2022) used \nbioinformatics and machine learning to identify 74 putative \nthermotolerant PET hydrolases with natural diversity. The \nthree candidate enzymes showed higher hydrolysis rates for \nthe crystalline powder compared to the amorphous powder \nor film. Furthermore, two of the candidates performed better \nfor amorphous films than for amorphous powders. However, \ntheir optimal temperatures range from 30 to 60 °C and their \nactivity levels are lower than those of  LCCICCG  at 70 °C. \nCarbios has announced the industrial use of  LCCICCG  for \nenzymatic recycling (https:// www. carbi os. com/ en/ enzym \natic- recyc ling/). PET hydrolases that can operate at tempera-\ntures lower than 68 °C for shorter than 24 h or PET hydro-\nlases that can degrade crystalline PET to the same extent \nas amorphous PET, achieving 98% conversion at 20% PET \nloading, could replace  LCCICCG . TurboPETase and LCC-\nA2 outperform  LCCICCG  on a laboratory scale, but their \ninvolvement in the industrial biorecycling of PET is yet to \nbe determined, as the industrialization involves several fac-\ntors other than PET hydrolase and requires the total process \nrefinement is needed.\nTaken together, PET hydrolases applicable to industrial \ndepolymerization of PET need enough thermostability close \nto the Tg of PET (below 80 °C) and keep sufficient durability \nand catalytic efficiency of at least 90% (ideally 95%) conver-\nsion against amorphous PET (high loading ~ 200 g/L; pref-\nerably higher).  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase can be the stand-\nard enzymes used for PET biorecycling. It should be noted \nto use  LCCICCG  or TurboPETase under its optimal condi-\ntions (pH 8.0 and 65-68 °C) on testing. In numerous studies, \nthe activity of each target enzyme has been compared to that \nof wild-type LCC (even after the publication of  LCCICCG ) \nor  LCCICCG  at lower temperatures, such as 30−50 °C. No \ninternational scientific consensus has emerged for the evalu-\nation of PET hydrolases (Arnal et al. 2023), which require \ncommercially available or voluntarily provided PET powder \nsamples for testing, as an amorphous film from Goodfellows \nCambridge, Ltd. was used as the standard substrate for PET \nhydrolases in the previous stage of research.\nThe performance of the resultant mutation appears to \ndepend on wild-type enzymes. For example, although ther -\nmostabilized mutants of IsPETase have been developed, \nthey are still unsuitable for industrial use (Arnal et al. 2023; \nCui et al. 2024). This is likely because PET hydrolases have \ncomparable core structures, but differ in their thermosta-\nbility and activity levels, which are determined by their \nunique sequences. Thermostabilized mutants of Is PETase \nhave been modified with the same amino acids found in type \nI enzymes, such as W159H/L117Y/Q119Y (DuraPETase) \nand a disulfide bond (IsPETaseTM N233C/S282C , and Hot-\nPETase), as described above. Positive indexes for improv -\ning type I enzymes include the introduction of an additional \ndisulfide bond at the appropriate position, mostly at the \ncation-binding site, to increase thermostability. Changing \nan obstacle amino acid to probable extension of the poly -\nmer chain was useful. For example, in Cut190, changing \nGln138 to Ala and in LCC, changing Tyr127 to Gly were \neffective. However, in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y, a single mutation \n Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404\n404 Page 14 of 18\nwas attempted by changing Gln94 to Tyr, but it failed. The \nsubstitution of Leu136 to Phe in Cut 190 and Leu93 to Phe \nin PES-H1L92F/Q94Y (LCC has Phe125 at the same position) \nlikely enhanced the interaction between the amino acid and \nthe polymer, resulting in a π-π interaction between Phe and \nthe aromatic ring of TPA. The combination of L92F and \nQ94Y in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y may create an aromatic channel \nalong with an aromatic clamp (Trp155 and Phe62) (Pfaff  \net al. 2022). It has yet to be confirmed whether the rule \nobserved in PES-H1 is applicable to others. However, the \nnew findings with PES-H1 and TurboPETase provide clues \nfor improved performance. PES-H1 has His130 and Leu210 \nin the conserved pair of His and Phe in subsite II of the \ntype I enzyme. Replacement of Leu with Phe reduced the \nactivity, but replacement with Thr improved the activity \n(Richter et al. 2023). BhrPETase shares a 94% identity with \nLCC and has a pair of His and Phe like LCC. However, its \nefficient mutant, TurboPETase, has a pair of His and Thr \n(Cui et al. 2024).  LCCICCG  contains His and Ile residues \ninstead of Phe. Therefore, the conserved amino acids can be \ncarefully mutated. Leu/Ile and Thr may lead to a more flex-\nible binding groove than that in the wild-type. TurboPETse \nchanged the pair of His218 and F189 at subsite I to Ser and \nIle, respectively, which are characteristic of IsPETase. This \nchange is believed to contribute to a more flexible binding \ngroove, along with the Phe243 to Thr mutation at subsite \nII. These changes improve flexibility in subsites I and II, \nwhich is considered the fourth index. The upcoming research \nstage will concentrate on PET hydrolases that can convert \nhigher loadings of PET at lower temperatures, comparable \nto those of  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase (preferably shorter). \nFurthermore, the focus will be on those that work better \non crystalline PET to minimize the PET pretreatment steps. \nArnal et al. (2023) suggested that acid-tolerant PET hydro-\nlases, which can efficiently depolymerize PET with no (or \nminimal) need for soda for pH regulation, would be useful \nin industrial applications.\nThe three most efficient templates for PET hydrolase \n(LCC, PES-H1, and BhrPETase) were identified using a \nmetagenomic approach. This suggests that a metagenome-\nderived enzyme gene is a mixture of multiple genes and is \nconsidered a mutant.\nMüller et al. (2005) discovered the first PET hydro-\nlases approximately 20 years ago. Carbios is constructing \nthe first plant for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET \nin Longlaville, Grand-Est Region, France. The plant is \nexpected to start the first significant deliveries to clients \nusing  LCCICCG  in 2026. From the end of 2026, Hündgen \nEntsorgungs GmbH & Co. KG will supply 15kt/year of \npost-consumer PET flakes to the first commercial plant \n(carbi os. com/ en/ enzym atic- recyc ling/). TurboPETase \n(Cui et al. 2024) and LCC-A2 (Zheng et al. 2024) outper -\nformed  LCCICCG , but the enzyme must overcome barriers \nof practical application for biorecycling. Further improve-\nment of PET hydrolases would be beneficial for future \nPET biorecycling. The knowledge accumulated regarding \nPET hydrolases is also useful for the biorecycling of other \npolymers.\nNow, the main target of biorecycling is transparent \nor colored bottles, which make up around 30% of PET \nproducts and fibers occupy approximately 60 % (Tournier \net al. 2023). Packaging films comprising amorphous PET \noccupy the third volume of all PET products. They are \npotential targets for biorecycling, when they are separated \nfrom other polymer packages such as polyethylene, poly -\npropylene, and polystyrene packages. Polyester fibers are \nmade of semicrystalline PET, which has a higher crys-\ntallinity than bottles. They can be targeted for the biore-\ncycling, using the same technology as that for PET bot-\ntles. However, fibers are often used in mixed forms with \nother natural or synthetic materials, and garments need \nmore complex processes to remove accessories such as \nbuttons and fasteners (natural, synthetic, or metal mate -\nrials). Polymer-recycling is closely linked to social sys-\ntems such as bans, laws, and waste-collection networks, \nthereby not dependent only on technological feasibility. \nHowever, expansion of the target for the biorecycling must \ncontribute to reducing the plastic release into the environ-\nment. Upcycling of degradation products (TPA and eth-\nylene glycol) coupled with biorecycling of PET has been \ntried (Amalia et al. 2024; Satta et al. 2024), but its future \nwould depend on technological development and economi-\ncal profitability.\nPET is unsusceptible to decomposition by UV, unlike \npolyolefins, which are prone to UV-induced decomposi-\ntion and become a constituent component of microplastics. \nNevertheless, PET microplastics occupy approximately half \nof the total microplastic, as they are released in household \nwastewater through polyester fabric laundry (garments, \ncarpets, textiles etc.). Detergents contain various enzymes \n(https:// bioso lutio ns. novoz ymes. com/ en/ dish/ insig hts/ artic \nle/ begin ners- guide- enzym es- deter gents). PET hydrolases \nare expected to prevent pilling on the surface of polyester \nfabrics. They might also offer a solution for removing micro-\nplastics and microfibers generated through laundry as one of \nthe detergent enzymes. This is also an industrial application \nof PET hydrolases. For laundry purpose, PET hydrolases \nmight satisfy new requirements, such as working at moder-\nately high temperatures and accomplishing the high decom-\nposition of pilling and microplastics (far lower concentration \nof PET materials in washings compared to industrial biore-\ncycling). Micro- and nanoplastics have far broader surface \nthan minimized PET particles for industrial biorecycling, \nwhich is beneficial to PET hydrolases. Enzymatic removal of \nmicroplastics and microfibers of PET can be technologically \npossible for municipal wastewater treatment.\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404 \n Page 15 of 18 404"

  "answer": "**Reasoning Behind the Major Steps**\n\n1. **Variant Design (Rational + Directed‑Evolution)** – The literature shows that activity and thermostability of PETases can be improved by targeting residues that influence substrate binding and catalytic efficiency. A scoring system that compares candidate sequences to the IsPETase reference (key residues, known beneficial mutations) guides the selection of mutations for synthesis.  \n2. **Gene Synthesis & Cloning** – Synthetic genes allow precise incorporation of the designed mutations and avoid errors introduced by PCR. Cloning into a high‑expression vector (pET‑28a) with a His‑tag facilitates downstream purification.  \n3. **Transformation & Colony Screening** – Rapid screening of transformants ensures that only correctly assembled plasmids are propagated, saving time in later expression steps.  \n4. **Small‑Scale Expression** – Overnight induction at 16 °C reduces inclusion‑body formation and yields soluble enzyme, which is critical for accurate activity measurements.  \n5. **Affinity Purification (Ni‑NTA)** – The His‑tag allows rapid, single‑step purification with high yield and purity, essential for reproducible activity assays.  \n6. **Enzyme Quantification** – Accurate concentration determination (Bradford) is required to normalize activity data across variants.  \n7. **PET Substrate Preparation** – Using a uniform amorphous PET (Gf‑PET) at 10 % w/v in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) provides a reproducible substrate that mimics industrial feedstock while remaining soluble for high‑throughput assays.  \n8. **Short‑Term Activity Assay** – A 1‑h incubation at 60 °C with 8 µM enzyme in a 96‑well format allows rapid comparison of catalytic rates while keeping the reaction within the linear range of product formation.  \n9. **Thermostability Assessment** – Pre‑incubation at 70 °C for 30 min followed by the activity assay reveals the enzyme’s ability to retain function at elevated temperatures, a key industrial requirement.  \n10. **Long‑Term Degradation Test** – A 24‑h reaction at 60 °C with 10 % PET and 8 µM enzyme mimics realistic processing conditions and allows measurement of total PET depolymerization.  \n11. **Product Quantification & Data Analysis** – HPLC or fluorescence readout of terephthalic acid (TPA) provides a quantitative measure of PET breakdown.
