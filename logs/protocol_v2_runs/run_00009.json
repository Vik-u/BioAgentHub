      "text": "and the uncertainties in our calculated numbers mentioned\nabove, direct comparison of computed and observed kinetic\nquantities is difficult. It has also been suggested that as the\nsubstrate of this reaction is non-aqueous, classical Michaelis–\nMenten kinetics cannot be used to relate reaction rates to\ncalculated energy barriers.\n[25]\nThese energy barriers calculated in this work are suitably\nlow to suggest that none of the hydrolysis steps catalysed by Is-\nPETase constitute its rate-limiting step. By a process of\nelimination, this leaves either substrate binding or product\nrelease as candidates for the rate limiting step. This is consistent\nwith the findings from site-directed mutagenesis studies, where\nthe largest improvements in enzyme activity were obtained\nthrough mutations that are thought to affect binding.\nIn several calculation steps starting from six MD snapshots,\nthe product geometry (Figure 2) was not found to be stable,\ninstead forming an alternate product state aPS (Figure 7). The\ncarboxylic moiety of the ligand was deprotonated, having\ntransferred to the side-chain oxygen of S131 causing the ɛ-\nnitrogen on H208 and the carboxyl of D177 to be protonated.\nThe energy of this state was calculated to be up to\n\u0000 137.4 kJ mol\n\u0000 1\nmore stable relative to the geometry of\nintermediate 4 that preceded it (Figure 5). Subsequent MD\nsimulations of the aPS state revealed that the deprotonated\nproduct forms strong hydrogen bonds with the active site\nresidues (Figure 6). This caused the ligand to persist in the\nactive site for up to 1 ns. This tendency for the product to\ndeprotonate while inside the active site might thus result in a\nsubstantial energy barrier in the product release step of the\nreaction. This would significantly hinder the enzyme’s catalytic\nefficiency."

  "answer": "**Reasoning for the protocol design**\n\n1. **Choice of host and expression system** –  \n   *E. coli* XJb (DE3) autolysis cells were selected because the literature (excerpts 1–3) shows that they allow rapid, high‑throughput expression and convenient cell lysis without the need for sonication or high‑pressure homogenisation. The pET28a(+) vector with a 6×His tag (excerpts 2–3) is compatible with Ni‑NTA purification and is routinely used for IREDs.\n\n2. **Auto‑induction media** –  \n   The protocol uses 1 mL overnight auto‑induction media containing 50 µg mL⁻¹ kanamycin, 1.5 M L‑arabinose and 0.5 M MgCl₂ (excerpts 2–3). This combination gives robust expression while keeping the culture volume small for screening.\n\n3. **Lysis buffer** –  \n   50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 0.03 % Tween‑20 (excerpts 2–3) is a standard buffer that preserves IRED activity and is compatible with downstream Ni‑NTA purification.\n\n4. **Purification** –  \n   A single Ni‑NTA step is sufficient for most IREDs. The protocol uses a 5 mL HisTrap column (not explicitly mentioned but standard) and elutes with 250 mM imidazole. The eluted fractions are buffer‑exchanged into 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl.\n\n5. **Activity assay** –  \n   Reductive amination is performed with 1 mM substrate, 0.5 mM NADPH, 50 µM enzyme in 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. The reaction is run for 30 min at 30 °C (typical for IREDs). The product is quenched with 10 % acetonitrile and analysed by LC‑MS on the ZenoTOF 7600+ (excerpts 4–5).\n\n6. **Stereoselectivity determination** –  \n   Chiral HPLC (Agilent 1260) is used to resolve the enantiomers. The same reaction mixture is injected after dilution with 50 % acetonitrile.\n\n7. **High‑throughput screening** –  \n   96‑well plates are used for the activity assay. The QuantStudio 7 Pro is employed for PCR amplification of mutant libraries (excerpts 1–3) and for dispensing 50 µL of water or 100 µL of reaction mix into each well (excerpts 1–3). The MultiFlo FX is used to dispense large volumes (125 mL or 150 mL) of buffer or reagents for column equilibration and elution (excerpts 6–7).\n\n8. **Iterative design–test–learn cycle** –  \n   Computational docking (AutoDock Vina) and Rosetta‑based design (PROSS, Rosetta Supercharge) are used to generate mutant libraries. Experimental data (activity, stereoselectivity, stability) are fed back into the computational pipeline to refine the next round of mutants.\n\n---\n\n## Experimental Workflow\n\n1. **Library construction and transformation**  \n   - **Goal**: Generate a diverse IRED mutant library in *E. coli* XJb (DE3).  \n   - **Reagents/Volumes**: 1 µg plasmid DNA per 50 µL reaction, 1 µL 10 × PCR buffer, 0.5 µL dNTP mix, 0.5 µL Taq polymerase, 0.5 µL primer mix.  \n   - **Instruments**: Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Pro (PCR).  \n   - **Parameters**: 95 °C 30 s; 30 cycles of 95 °C 10 s, 55 °C 20 s, 72 °C 30 s; 72 °C 5 min.  \n   - **Actions**: Run PCR, purify product, ligate into pET28a(+), transform into XJb (DE3).  \n   - **QC/Observations**: Gel electrophoresis shows correct insert size; colony PCR confirms presence of insert.  \n   - **Next Step Trigger**: Successful colony PCR.  \n   - **Safety**: Handle DNA with gloves; dispose of waste in biohazard container.\n\n2. **Auto‑induction culture**  \n   - **Goal**: Express IRED variants.  \n   - **Reagents/Volumes**: 1 mL auto‑induction media per colony (50 µg mL⁻¹ kanamycin, 1.5 M L‑arabinose, 0.5 M MgCl₂).  \n   - **Instruments**: Incubator shaker at 37 °C, 200 rpm.  \n   - **Parameters**: 16 h growth.  \n   - **Actions**: Inoculate overnight cultures, incubate.  \n   - **QC/Observations**: OD₆₀₀ ≈ 1.5–2.0 indicates sufficient biomass.  \n   - **Next Step Trigger**: Harvest cells.  \n   - **Safety**: Use biosafety cabinet;
