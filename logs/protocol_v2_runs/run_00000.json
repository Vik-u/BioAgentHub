Among other techniques, \nPET hydrolases (PETases) can be used to depolymerize this plastic. However, wildtype PETases exhibit poor \nspecific activities and insufficient thermostability, limiting their use in depolymerization processes which require \nhigh temperatures. In 2022, machine learning-aided enzyme engineering of a PETase stemming from the bac -\nterium Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) resulted in a more functional, active, stable, and tolerant variant (FAST- \nPETase). To rationalize the molecular basis of FAST-PETase ’ s improved thermal stability, we performed \ncomparative Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of wildtype \nIs PETase (WT-PETase) and FAST-PETase at 30\n◦\nC and 50\n◦\nC identifying thermolabile sequence stretches in the \nwildtype enzyme. Further analysis of the backbone flexibility revealed that all mutations of FAST-PETase \naffected these critical regions. Counterintuitively, the in-silico analyses additionally highlighted that the flexi -\nbility of these regions decreased at 50\n◦\nC in FAST-PETase, instead of exhibiting increased flexibility at higher \ntemperature as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations. This effect was confirmed by physical \nenergy calculations, which suggest that temperature-dependent conformational changes of FAST-PETase \ndecrease the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G(stability)) and rigidify the enzyme at elevated temperatures \nenhancing stability. Looking forward, these findings might help guide the rational engineering of protein ther -\nmostability and contribute to our understanding of the thermal adaptation of thermophilic enzymes.\n1. Introduction\nTo achieve a circular economy, the ability to recycle the growing \namount of plastic waste is considered to be of high priority. [1] With PET \naccounting for around 12 % of the global solid waste volume (8 % by \nweight), the development of efficient and economical de- and repoly -\nmerization processes is therefore key. [2,3] One such PET depolymer -\nization strategy is the plastics ’ enzymatic hydrolysis, first reported in \n2005. [4,5] Although several enzymes with PET-hydrolyzing activities \nhave been identified, such as esterase, lipase and cutinase enzyme an -\nnotations, [6 – 9] expensive PET pretreatments are necessary to achieve \nacceptable depolymerizing activities with these promiscuous enzymes. \n[10 – 12] In 2016, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) was \nreported to be suitable for the operation at temperatures between 30 and \n50 \n◦\nC. [13] However, this enzyme was found to be poorly stable, with \nloss of activities after 24 hours incubation at 37 \n◦\nC. [14] Since PET \nbecomes more accessible near its glass transition temperature (65 – 75 \n◦\nC), [15] increasing T\nm \nand optimal operating temperature of Is PETase \nis desirable. Thus, several enzyme engineering strategies have been \napplied to optimize Is PETase ’ s utility by enhancing its thermostability, \nactivity and process conditions. [14,16 – 19] As a result, two stabilized \nvariants, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, were generated, which dis -\nplayed higher thermostability ( Δ T\nm \n10 and 30 \n◦\nC, respectively) and \nactivity at elevated temperatures ( > 60 \n◦\nC) but lower activity when mild \ntemperatures (30 – 50 \n◦\nC) were applied in depolymerization experiments. \n[14,16,20] Building on initial engineering attempts, Is PETase was \n* Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: ac4086@coventry.ac.uk (S.

      "text": "Directed evolution of a thermostable PETase. We selected a \nrationally designed, thermostabilized variant of Is PETase contain-\ning three mutations, S121E, D186H, R280A (Is PETaseTS, melting \ntemperature (Tm) of 56.8 °C),24 as a starting point for engineering. \nConsistent with previous reports, IsPETaseTS displays superior PET \ndegradation activity compared to the wild-type enzyme at 40 °C; \nhowever, this activity decreases dramatically at more elevated tem -\nperatures (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nOur first objective was to develop a high-throughput screening \nworkflow to underpin the directed evolution study. To this end, indi-\nvidual enzyme variants were evaluated as crude cell lysates arrayed \nin 96-deep-well plates, using amorphous PET film (amoPET, 6.7% \ncrystallinity, sourced from Goodfellow as a preform sheet) as the \nreaction substrate. The amoPET substrate allowed us to prepare \nuniform 6 mm diameter discs that could be easily placed into indi\n-\nvidual wells to allow fair comparison of variant activity (Fig. 1). We \nfound that the addition of our standard chemical cell lysis reagents, \nlysozyme and polymyxin B, resulted in the production of a lysate \nwith substantially reduced activity (Supplementary Fig. 2), hence, we \ndeveloped a method for 96-well plate cell lysis using the commercial \nreagent, BugBuster. The accumulation of mono(2-hydroxyethyl) \nterephthalate (MHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) in the reaction \nsupernatant was monitored by ultra performance liquid chroma\n-\ntography (UPLC); these two products result from the partial and \ncomplete hydrolysis of the PET backbone, respectively, and are \nthe known major products of Is PETase-mediated depolymeriza\n-\ntions18,31. Using the UPLC method developed here, the MHET and \nTPA produced by a single degradation reaction can be analysed \nin under 2 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using our integrated, \nautomated system, over 2,000 enzyme variants can be assessed for \nplastic deconstruction activity in around 2 days.\nThe evolutionary strategy comprised sequential rounds of satu\n-\nration mutagenesis, using degenerate NNK codons to individually \nrandomize between 24–30 residue positions per cycle. In total, 106 \nof the 264 residues present in Is PETase were targeted for mutation \nthroughout evolution. Residues were selected for randomization on \nthe basis of a number of considerations, including their identifica\n-\ntion by online protein stability-enhancing tools, visual inspection \nof the protein crystal structure or previous reports of their involve\n-\nment in substrate binding or thermostability (Supplementary Table \n1). In each round of evolution, around the top 3% of hits were \nassessed as purified enzymes. Beneficial mutations found were then \ncombined by DNA shuffling, and the resulting variants assayed as \npurified proteins to identify the most active sequence, which was \nthen used as a template for the next round of evolution.

Enzymatic PEt depolymerizations mainly produce MHEt, tPA and ethylene glycol (EG). the example UPLC trace demonstrates the MHEt and tPA \nproduced following a 5 h PEt degradation reaction of semicrystalline PEt powder (cryPEt), with absorbance on the y axis in milli-absorbance units (mAu) \nand retention time on the x axis in minutes (min).

For rounds 1–4, the primary focus was on improved \ncatalysis at elevated temperatures. Cell lysates were pre-incubated \nat sequentially higher temperatures (from 55–75 °C) for 1 h, before \nconducting PET depolymerization reactions for 3 h. The reaction \ntemperature also increased from 55–70 °C during these rounds \n(Supplementary Table 1). Once a satisfactory level of thermostabil\n-\nity was achieved, additional selection pressures of catalyst longevity \nand activity on more crystalline material were added. To this end, \nreactions in rounds 5 and 6 were conducted at 70 °C, with reaction \ntimes of 5 and 7 h, respectively, initially using amoPET as the sub\n-\nstrate. The top 3% of clones identified during rounds 5 and 6 were \nthen screened as purified enzymes against a commercially available \nsemicrystalline PET powder (cryPET, 29.8% crystallinity, sourced \nfrom Goodfellow) that has a crystallinity level more reminiscent of \nmaterial dominant in postconsumer waste streams\n33,34.\nThe most thermostable and active variant to emerge following six \nrounds of evolution, HotPETase, contains 21 mutations compared \nto IsPETaseWT: three from the starting protein template IsPETaseTS, \ntwo from the rational insertion of an additional disulfide bridge and \na further 16 found through directed evolution (Fig. 1 and Extended \nData Fig. 1). HotPETase has a melting temperature of 82.5 °C, the \nhighest Tm recorded so far of an active Is PETase derivative. This \nelevated thermostability means that the enzyme can be incubated \nbefore reaction at 75 °C for 90 min with only a 6% loss of activity \nover 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 4). Enzyme pre-incubation at 80 °C \nfor 90 min resulted in a more substantial 35% reduction in activity. \nAssessment of variants along the evolutionary trajectory demon -\nstrated that evolution led to progressive improvements in both ther-\nmostability and activity in cryPET deconstruction assays performed \nat 60 °C (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). While Is PETase\nWT and \nIsPETaseTS have minimal activity at 60 °C, HotPETase operated well \nunder these conditions.\nBiochemical characterization. We next determined the activity \nof HotPETase across a range of temperatures by monitoring the \nrelease of MHET and TPA over time (Fig. 2b). For comparison, \nanalogous experiments were performed using the starting template, \nIsPETase\nTS, and the engineered thermostable cutinase LCC ICCG  \n(ref. 16). Comparisons between LCCICCG and IsPETase variants were \ncarried out under the optimal buffer conditions for each individual \nprotein16,18, using cryPET powder as the substrate (Supplementary \nFig. 5). At 40 °C, slightly improved initial reaction rates were \nachieved by HotPETase versus IsPETaseTS (Fig. 2b), demonstrating \nthat the evolution of thermostability has not compromised activity at \nambient temperatures. While the activity of IsPETase\nTS was severely \ncompromised at higher temperatures, the rate of PET hydrolysis by \nHotPETase is substantially improved by operating at temperatures \napproaching the reported T\ng of PET in aqueous solutions (around \n60–65 °C)14. At 65 °C, each mole of HotPETase releases 2.7 × 104 M \nof monomers in 1 hour, a time-course over which reaction progres-\nsion is linear. At the same temperature LCC ICCG produced 5.7 × 103 \nmoles of monomer product in the same time frame, highlighting \nthe superior catalytic activity of this engineered IsPETase. For both \nHotPETase and LCCICCG, the reaction rates were slightly reduced at \n70 versus 65 °C.\nComparison of reactions with HotPETase and Is PETaseTS at \n40 °C show that evolution has afforded a more robust catalyst \nwith increased longevity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2). For \nIsPETaseTS, soluble product formation essentially ceases after 8 h. In \ncontrast, for reactions with HotPETase, monomeric products con -\ntinue to accumulate for more than 48 h. Consistent with previous \nstudies26, the reaction profile is non-linear with faster initial phase \nfor roughly 8 h, followed by a slower phase from 8–48 h. Similar, \nbut more pronounced, non-linear reaction profiles are observed at \nelevated temperatures (from 60–70 °C, Extended Data Fig. 2). The \ntime-course of reactions with HotPETase at 65 °C demonstrate that \nproduct accumulation rises rapidly for the first of 3 h of reaction \n(1.51 mM of MHET + TPA), but then slows substantially after this \ntime, producing 1.61 mM of soluble monomers over 48 h (Fig. 2d). \nAs a result, while PET depolymerization with HotPETase is substan-\ntially faster at 65 °C, the extent of depolymerization at longer time \nframes is greater at 40 °C (Fig. 2c,d).\nProduct accumulation over time is also non-linear for LCCICCG in \nreactions at 65 °C, with 0.68 and 1.78 mM of monomers produced \nover 5 and 48 h, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3). It is interest -\ning to note that HotPETase operating at 40 °C deconstructs cry -\nPET more efficiently than LCC ICCG at 65 °C, both with respect to \ninitial rate and extent of depolymerization over 48 h. HotPETase \nalso depolymerizes amoPET discs (used for library screening) more \neffectively than LCC\nICCG across a range of temperatures from 40 to \n65 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6). At 70 °C, although HotPETase pro -\nduces more soluble monomers than LCC ICCG over 3 h, at this tem -\nperature over 24 h, LCC ICCG is a more effective depolymerase of \namoPET due to its enhanced longevity.\nTo understand the origins of the non-linear reaction profiles of \nHotPETase, particularly at elevated temperatures, we conducted \nexperiments to supply additional enzyme or substrate once reaction \nprogression had ceased. Addition of fresh HotPETase, following \ncryPET depolymerization for 24 h at 60 °C, leads to similar prod\n-\nuct accumulation versus time trends as observed at the outset of \nthe reaction (Extended Data Fig. 4). In contrast, addition of fresh \nPET substrate does not give rise to any additional soluble products. \nThese observations suggest that reactions stall due to catalyst deac\n-\ntivation, not as a result of inhibition by soluble released products or \nexhaustion of available plastic substrate. It is interesting to note that \nduring evolution, IsPETase libraries were analysed over time frames \nranging from 3 to 7 h, meaning that limited selection pressure was \napplied to catalyst longevity at elevated temperatures. We anticipate \nthat adapting selection pressures during future rounds of evolution \nwill lead to improved variants capable of operating efficiently at \nelevated temperatures for more extended periods.\nTo further explore the use of HotPETase, we next attempted \nto deconstruct commercial-grade PET materials. HotPETase can \ndepolymerize milled bottle-grade PET (bgPET, 41.9% crystallinity, \nfull material characterization can be found in Extended Data Table 1 \nand Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), albeit with a reduced conversion \ncompared to that observed with cryPET powder (Fig. 3) (9.7 and \n2.8% with cryPET and bgPET, respectively). To showcase the selec\n-\ntivity achievable with biocatalytic depolymerizations, HotPETase \nwas used to deconstruct a common laminated packaging tray lid \ncomposed of PET and polyethylene (PE) (1.6% crystallinity, thick\n-\nness of 325 μm PET and 40 μm PE, Extended Data Table 1). This \nPET/PE laminate is challenging to recycle mechanically, and indeed \nis considered a pollutant in commercial recycling streams. The \nHotPETase enzyme is adept at selectively deconstructing the PET \nportion of this material. In this instance, the extent of depolymeriza\n-\ntion after 24 h is substantially improved at 60 versus 40 °C (9.2 versus \n2.9 mM of soluble monomer products released, corresponding to a \ndegree of depolymerization of 48.1 and 15.3%, respectively, Fig. 3a  \nand Extended Data Fig. 5). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \nreveals significant pitting of the PET surface, whereas the PE sur\n-\nface appears unchanged, compared to control reactions run in the \nabsence of enzyme (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9).

Differential scanning \ncalorimetry (DSC) analysis of samples before and after depolymer\n-\nization show an overall increase in crystallinity from 29.8 to 41.7%, \nsuggesting that HotPETase preferentially degrades the amorphous \nPET domains (Supplementary Fig. 13a and Extended Data Table 2). \nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis shows no substantive \nchange in the molecular weight and dispersity of the remaining PET \n(Supplementary Fig. 13b), which may indicate that the enzyme oper\n-\nates in an exo-cleavage fashion, depolymerizing individual polymer \nchains fully before chain transfer to a new macromolecule, thus retain\n-\ning the original chain lengths in the bulk of the sample. Applying the \noptimized reaction conditions for cryPET depolymerization to alterna\n-\ntive PET materials (bgPET and PET/PE laminate film) fails to enhance \nthe rate or extent of depolymerization at 60 °C (Extended Data Fig. 5), \nsuggesting that optimal process conditions are highly dependent on \nthe characteristics of the material undergoing deconstruction.\nStructural analysis. To gain insights into the origins of HotPETase \nthermostability and its improved activity, the crystal structure \nof the enzyme was solved and refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å for \ncomparison to the starting variant Is PETase\nTS. The structures of \nHotPETase (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 7QVH) and IsPETaseTS (PDB \n6IJ6) superimpose well, with a root-mean-square-deviation of \n1.18 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In HotPETase, the disulfide bridge \nbetween the Cys233 and Cys282 pair is formed as intended, with \nan S–S interatomic distance of 2.03 Å (Extended Data Fig. 7b)."

This residue is directly interacting with the\nHEMT moiety, but because HEMT is a small molecule, the\nstructure does not reveal other residues that might be involved\nin binding the PET substrate. To identify these residues, we\nperformed a model of a Michaelis complex using a 8mer-PET\npolymer as a substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). Our model\nindicated that in addition to the interactions with W185, the\n8mer-PET polymer is also interacting with residues in the β6-β7\nloop (preceded by W185). We performed molecular dynamics\nsimulations of various substitutions at position 186 and found a\nstrong dependence of the flexibility of the sidechain of W185\nand the β6-β7 loop on the size of residue 186 (Supplementary\nFigure S3).\nThe beneficial effect of the flexibility of W185 and the loops\nin the active site with the PET hydrolytic activity has been also\nhighlighted by Chen et al.\n[35]\nand Crnjar et al.\n[36]\nwhen studying\nthe double mutant S214H/I218F. Based on the MD simulations,\nwe mutated residue D186 to alanine, the residue that was\npredicted to confer the highest flexibility to the wobbly\ntryptophan and the β6-β7 loop. The PETase variant D186A\n(PETase\nA\n) exhibited an increase in melting temperature of\n~10 ° C while at the same time retaining a high level of activity\nup even at 50 ° C. In the 1.6 Å crystal structure of our variant\nCombi-PETase (Figure 2), we refined W185 and observed that\nthe modelled density around the sidechain of W185 is not\ncompletely supported by an occupancy of 1, as well as\nadditional density adjacent but not connected to this residue.\nHowever, the additional density was not enough to confidently\nmodel a second conformation as observed in previous\nstructures.\n[37][34]\nTogether with the high B-factors on the atoms\nof W185, it does suggest that W185 is in fact flexible\n(Supplementary Figure S6A).\nD186 is not conserved in other cutinase enzymes and is\nmost commonly a histidine in thermostable homologs, so the\nsingle mutant of PsPETase D186A had not been explored\nbefore. The substitution D186H alone does not provide better\nactivity but it led to the development of ThermoPETase\n[11]\nwhich\nserved as scaffold for developing other variants like\nFigure 1.

Recently, using a semi-saturation muta-\ngenesis experiment, Yin et al. identified the double variant\nD186A/S121P. Because the crystal structure of the S121P/D186A\ndouble mutant could not resolve various conformations of\nW185 side chain, the authors explained the increased activity\nwas caused by a reduction in the flexibility.\n[38]\nHowever, the\nauthors did not note that this is also common in other crystal\nstructures of PsPETase variants, and that the different conforma-\ntions of the so-called wobbly tryptophan W185 is not always\nresolved in multiple conformations. Nailing down all the\npossible conformations is difficult- seeing that density is missing\nis easy.\nPETase\nACC\n– Generation 2\nTo further improve the thermal stability of our PETase\nA\nvariant,\nwe introduced a third disulfide bridge using the N233C and\nS282C mutations. The design of this disulfide bridge was based\non the work of Then et al., who identified a stabilizing calcium\nbinding site in TfCut2, a homolog enzyme with 51 % sequence\nsimilarity of PETase.\n[39]\nBy engineering a disulfide bridge in that\nposition, the authors mimicked the effect of calcium binding\nand increased the Tm of TfCut2 by 24.9 ° C.\n[40]\nSimilar substitu-\ntions were performed on Cut190,\n[41]\nLCC,\n[42]\nand\nThermoPETase.\n[11]\nBased on a structural alignment between\nTfCut2 and PETase\nA\n, the equivalent disulfide bridge was\nengineered between residues N233 and S282. The triple mutant\nPET\nACC\ndisplayed a cooperative effect on the thermal stability\nelevating the melting temperature by another 11.4 ° C (to\n64.7 ° C). The increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nallows\na much higher activity compared to PETase\nA\nat a reaction\ntemperature of 50 ° C. The formation of the disulfide bond\nbetween N233C and S282C was confirmed to be present and\nfully occupied in the electron density of the Combi-PETase\nstructure (Supplementary Figure S6C) and the structure of the\nPETase\nACC\n(PDB accession code 8VEL).\nPETase\nACCCET\n– Generation 3\nFurther attempts to improve the thermal stability of our\nPETase\nACC\nvariant by rational design only led to modest\nimprovements. Individually, the A179C, S136E and S214T (CET)\nmutations each increased melting temperature of PETase\nACC\nby\nca. 3.2 ° C, 0.9 ° C and 2.1 ° C respectively (Supplementary Ta-\nble S3). However, the effect of these mutations was additive\nand the combined mutant PETase\nACCCET\ndisplayed a Tm of\n67.8 ° C (Figure 1A, Table 1), sufficient to increase the optimal\nreaction temperature to 60 ° C.\nThe A179C variant fills a hydrophobic cavity in the core of\nthe enzyme, a strategy that is commonly used to improve the\nthermal stability of mesophilic enzymes.\n[41]\nThis effect is\napparent in the density around residue A179C in the crystal\nstructure of Combi-PETase (Supplementary Figure S6D).\nThe mutant S136E has a small effect on the thermal stability\nof the enzyme as measured by DSF, but it also showed a 1.3-\nfold increase in hydrolytic activity compared to our PETase\nACC\nvariant and was compatible with the other mutations, so it was\nretained for future generations. In the crystal structure we do\nnot see the direct formation of any new salt bridge by the\nS136E substitution, so the effect may be due to a transient\nintraprotein interaction or to an improvement in enzyme-\nsolvent interactions.\nThe S214T variant increased the enzymatic activity by 12 %\n(Supplementary Table S3). Both the crystal structure of Combi-\nPETase (this work) and of the wild type (PDB 6EQE)\n[43]\nresolve\nthe sidechain of residue 214 in three different orientations with\nsimilar occupancies. Molecular dynamics simulations show that\nin the wild type, S214 (located in β7-α4 loop) preferably makes\na hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of P184, located at the start\nof the β6-β7 loop, while the mutation to threonine (T214)\nbreaks this interaction (Figure 2F and G). This can enhance the\nflexibility of the β6-β7 loop and the binding site, explaining the\nincreased activity of this variant. Both A179C and S214T are\nnewly discovered mutations, while S136E has been previously\nshown present similar beneficial effects on the wild type\nsequence.\n[44]\nPETase\nACCCETN\n– Generation 4\nIn a previous publication we performed an Ancestral Sequence\nReconstruction (ASR) experiment on the wild type PsPETase, in\nwhich identified some ancestor sequences that showed\nimproved thermostability.\n[20]\nContinuing from this, we inte-\ngrated and tested several of the ASR designs into our\nPETase\nACCCET\nvariant (Supplementary Table S4) and identified the\nK95N mutation which exhibited a further increase in thermal\nstability (Tm = 70.4 ° C) and a 12 % increase in terms of\nenzymatic activity. Two directed evolution experiments ren-\ndered variants that included the K95N mutation: HOT-PETase\n[21]\nand PETaseTM,\n[43]\n(with 21 and 2 mutations respectively).\nCombining Machine Learning/AI Mutations to the PETase\nACCCETN\nA new variant (FAST-PETase) has recently been developed using\na ML-based enzyme engineering method (MutCompute)\n[13]\nand\nbased on the ThermoPETase variant. The authors predicted and\ntested 159 mutations and identified three of them (N233K,\nR224Q and S121E) that when added to the ThermoPETase\n(D186H/R280A) yielded a variant with high activity at an\noptimal temperature of 50 ° C. From the FAST-PETase mutations,\nthe N233K mutant is of particular interest, because introducing\nthis single point mutation on other homologous PET-degrading\nenzymes also produces enzymes with higher degradation rates.\nWiley VCH Dienstag, 07.05.2024\n2410 / 350675 [S. 178/183]\n1\nChemBioChem 2024, 25, e202400084 (5 of 10) © 2024 The Authors.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nThus, it appears that this mutation is transferable to related\nenzymes. We introduced the N233K mutant into our Combi-\nPETase, noting that this mutation would break the engineered\ndisulfide bridge between residue N233C and S282C. Because it\nis difficult to compare the results from the literature given that\nthe reaction conditions and the substrates often differ,\n[21]\nwe\ndecided to order, express, purify and test the FAST-PETase\nsequence as from the literature but using our activity assay and\nsubstrates.\n[13]\nThe new variant derived from FAST-PETase and\nCombi-PETase (namely PETase\nAKCETN\n) showed a modest Tm\ndecrease to 67.5 ° C compared to Combi-PETase and a reduction\nof 10 ° C of the optimum temperature back to 50 ° C, same as the\nFAST-PETase variant. (Figure 1A and 1C, Table 1). The activity of\nPETase\nAKCETN\nat 50 ° C is the same as Combi-PETase at the same\ntemperature but lower than the Combi-PETase at 60 ° C.\nHowever, the yield of the PETase\nAKCETN\nvariant is much higher\n(Figure 1B, Table 1).\nAssessing the Enzyme’s Suitability for Industrial Applications\nDue to higher activity and protein yields, we evaluated the\nsuitability of the Combi-PETase and PETase\nAKCETN\nvariants for\nindustrial applications. For these two variants, we performed\nlong-term reaction experiments at high temperatures and high\nenzyme concentrations, and we also tested the residual activity\nof Combi-PETase against a high-crystalline PET substrate.\nFigure 3 shows the enzymes’ activity at 50 and 60 ° C for up\nto 28 hours using FAST-PETase as a control. While at 50 ° C, all\nthese enzymes perform similarly after either 2 or 28 hours\n(Figure 3A, and Supplementary Figure S4), at 60 ° C Combi-\nPETase performs better than PETase\nAKCETN\n, which in turn is better\nthan FAST-PETase.\nWild type PsPETase has been noted to show a concentration\ninhibition effect when the enzyme’s concentration exceeds\n150 nM.\n[6]\nAlthough the reason for this inhibition is not fully\nunderstood, this is a problem for industrial applications. Avilan\net al. has shown that it is also present in other mesophilic\nenzymes and that it can be improved using protein engineering\nto increase the thermal stability, by adding additives to the\nreaction (e. g. DMSO), or by modifying the substrate (increasing\nthe polymer surface area).\n[45]\nHotPETase, a variant generated by\na directed mutagenesis approach,\n[24]\nis an example of a highly\nthermostable variant that shows reduced inhibition by enzyme\nconcentration. This effect is also displayed in our Combi-PETase,\nwhere we observe at least a 4-fold increase in the optimal\nenzyme concentration for the reaction (to ~800 nM, Figure 3C).\nPsPETase has been discovered to naturally break down low\ncrystalline PET (lc-PET). However, high crystalline PET (hc-PET) is\na prevalent waste product that is difficult to break down by all\nknown PETases. To determine the effect of the crystallinity of\nthe substrate on the reaction rate of our Combi-PETase, we\ntested the enzyme against both hc-PET (post-consumer Coca-\nCola bottle, ca. 45 % crystallinity)\n[46]\nand lc-PET (powdered\nGoodFellow PET film, amorphous). We measured the degrada-\ntion products (TPA and MHET) over 28 hours using UPLC\n(Figure 4). As usual for all PET hydrolases, lc-PET is more\nsusceptible to breakdown by Combi-PETase than hc-PET,\nresulting in a total of 29 mM and 19 mM of total released\nproducts respectively. However, this means that the Combi-\nPETase retains 65 % of the activity against hc-PET, which is very\nhigh compared to other PETase enzymes.\n[19,47]\nIndeed, LCC\nIGGA\nvariant retains between 25–35 % activity when reacting with\nmicroparticles (� 250 μm) of 32–35 % crystalline PET.\n[20]\nMost\nPET degrading enzymes also show less than 50 % activity\nagainst PET film substrates with 13–23 % crystallinity.\n[17]"

  "answer": "## Experimental Workflow\n\n1. **Goal/Action** – Clone the engineered PETase library into an E. coli expression vector and transform into competent cells.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Use a 96‑well deep‑well format. In each well add 50 µL of LB medium containing 100 µg mL⁻¹ ampicillin, inoculate with 5 µL of chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid, and incubate at 37 °C for 16 h with gentle shaking.  \n   **Instruments** – **Tecan Fluent 1080** (SetTemperature 37 °C, 16 h) to maintain uniform growth across all wells. The Fluent’s programmable temperature control ensures consistent induction conditions.  \n   **Expected observation** – Visible turbidity in each well indicating cell growth; colonies should appear on agar plates if plated.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Proceed to protein induction once OD₆₀₀ ≈ 0.6–0.8 is reached.\n\n2. **Goal/Action** – Induce PETase expression with IPTG.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Add 5 µL of 1 mM IPTG to each well (final concentration 0.5 mM). Incubate at 30 °C for 4 h with shaking.  \n   **Instruments** – **Tecan Fluent 1080** (SetTemperature 30 °C, 4 h). The lower temperature reduces misfolding and improves soluble expression.  \n   **Expected observation** – Increased cell density and a shift in the culture’s color from pale to darker due to protein production.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Harvest cells when the culture reaches OD₆₀₀ ≈ 1.2–1.4.\n\n3. **Goal/Action** – Harvest cells and perform BugBuster‑mediated lysis.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Centrifuge each well at 4 °C, 4,000 × g for 10 min. Resuspend the pellet in 200 µL BugBuster reagent (1:1 volume with culture) per 1 mL of culture. Incubate at 25 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation.  \n   **Instruments** – **Tecan Fluent 1080** (SetTemperature 25 °C, 30 min). The Fluent’s precise temperature control prevents premature protein denaturation during lysis.  \n   **Expected observation** – Clear lysate with a slight yellow tint; activity assays should show higher MHET/TPA production compared to lysates prepared with lysozyme/polymyxin B.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Transfer lysate to 96‑well plates for the PET hydrolysis assay.\n\n4. **Goal/Action** – Prepare uniform PET film discs and set up the hydrolysis assay.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Cut 6 mm diameter discs from a 6.7 % crystallinity amorphous PET (amoPET) sheet using a sterile biopsy punch. Place one disc into each well of a 96‑deep‑well plate. Add 200 µL of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, to each well.  \n   **Instruments** – **Tecan Fluent 1080** (SetTemperature 20 °C, 5 min) to equilibrate the buffer and discs before adding lysate. The Fluent’s plate‑level temperature control ensures all discs experience identical conditions.  \n   **Expected observation** – Uniformly sized discs with no visible cracks; buffer should be clear.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Add the lysate to the wells.\n\n5. **Goal/Action** – Incubate the reaction mixture at the target temperature to drive PET hydrolysis.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Add 50 µL of the clarified lysate to each well (final enzyme concentration ≈ 0.5 µg mL⁻¹). Incubate at 60 °C for 1 h.  \n   **Instruments** – **Tecan Fluent 1080** (SetTemperature 60 °C, 1 h). The Fluent’s rapid temperature ramp and uniform heating are critical for reproducible activity measurements.  \n   **Expected observation** – Slight cloudiness in the supernatant due to released MHET/TPA; the reaction should be complete within the hour for the most active variants.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Stop the reaction and prepare samples for analysis.\n\n6. **Goal/Action** – Stop the reaction, store samples, and quantify released MHET/TPA.  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Add 50 µL of 0.1 M H₂SO₄ to each well to quench the reaction. Transfer 100 µL of the supernatant to a new 96‑well plate, add 200 µL of 50 % methanol to precipitate proteins, and centrifuge at 4 °C, 10,000 × g for 5 min. Inject 10 µL of the clear supernatant into an UPLC system equipped with a C18 column and a UV detector set at 240 nm.  \n   **Instruments** – **QuantStudio 7 Pro** (Store all plates at –20 °C) to preserve the samples for downstream analysis. The QuantStudio’s low‑temperature storage capability prevents degradation of MHET/TPA.  \n   **Expected observation** – Retention times of MHET (~3.2 min) and TPA (~5.8 min) in the chromatogram; peak areas proportional to enzyme activity.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Compile activity data and calculate specific activities for each variant.\n\n7. **Goal/Action** – Determine the melting temperature (Tₘ) of each variant by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).  \n   **Detailed instructions** – Prepare 10 µM protein solutions in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, with 5 µM SYPRO Orange dye. Load 20 µL into a 96‑well PCR plate. Perform a temperature gradient from 20 °C to 95 °C at 1 °C min⁻¹ on a real‑time PCR instrument.  \n   **Instruments** – **QuantStudio 7 Pro** (SetTemperature ramp 1 °C min⁻¹, 20–95 °C). The QuantStudio’s fluorescence detection and precise temperature control make it ideal for DSF.  \n   **Expected observation** – A sigmoidal fluorescence increase; the inflection point corresponds to the Tₘ. Variants with Tₘ > 80 °C (e.g., HOT‑PETase) will show a sharp transition near 82.5 °C.  \n   **Next step trigger** – Feed Tₘ and activity data into the computational workflow for the next design cycle.\n\n---\n\n## Computational Workflow\n\nThe computational arm of the campaign is an iterative loop that transforms experimental data into actionable design hypotheses. First, the activity (MHET/TPA release) and thermostability (Tₘ) values obtained from the experimental workflow are collated into a structured database. These quantitative phenotypes serve as labels for a supervised machine‑learning pipeline that has been trained on a curated set of PETase sequences from the Brenda database. The training set includes features such as amino‑acid composition, predicted secondary‑structure propensity, and evolutionary conservation scores. Three models—linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest—are evaluated for their ability to predict the optimal reaction temperature (T_opt) of a given variant. The model with the highest cross‑validated R² (typically the random forest) is selected to score a computationally generated mutant library.\n\nThe mutant library is produced by a combinatorial in‑silico directed‑evolution engine that applies single‑ and double‑point mutations to the current best variant (e.g., HOT‑PETase). Each mutant is evaluated by the predictive model; only those with a predicted T_opt ≥ 70 °C and a predicted Tₘ ≥ 80 °C are retained for synthesis. The top 200 candidates are then subjected to constraint‑network analysis (CNAnalysis) to identify thermolabile sequence stretches that may compromise stability at high temperature. Molecular‑dynamics (MD) simulations at 50 °C are run for the top 20 candidates to assess backbone flexibility and active‑site dynamics; mutants that maintain low RMSF in the catalytic triad while reducing flexibility in the identified thermolabile regions are prioritized.\n\nThe selected mutants are chemically synthesized, cloned, and expressed following the experimental workflow. The resulting activity and Tₘ data are fed back into the database, retraining the machine‑learning models to refine their predictive accuracy. This closed‑loop cycle continues until the desired performance metrics—T_opt ≥ 70 °C, Tₘ ≥ 82 °C, and ≥ 40 % activity increase over the previous generation—are achieved. Throughout, the computational pipeline also monitors for trade‑offs such as loss of activity at ambient temperatures, ensuring that the evolved PETase retains broad operational flexibility, as exemplified by FAST‑PETase and HOT‑PETase."
