Among other techniques, \nPET hydrolases (PETases) can be used to depolymerize this plastic. However, wildtype PETases exhibit poor \nspecific activities and insufficient thermostability, limiting their use in depolymerization processes which require \nhigh temperatures. In 2022, machine learning-aided enzyme engineering of a PETase stemming from the bac -\nterium Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) resulted in a more functional, active, stable, and tolerant variant (FAST- \nPETase). To rationalize the molecular basis of FAST-PETase ’ s improved thermal stability, we performed \ncomparative Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of wildtype \nIs PETase (WT-PETase) and FAST-PETase at 30\n◦\nC and 50\n◦\nC identifying thermolabile sequence stretches in the \nwildtype enzyme. Further analysis of the backbone flexibility revealed that all mutations of FAST-PETase \naffected these critical regions. Counterintuitively, the in-silico analyses additionally highlighted that the flexi -\nbility of these regions decreased at 50\n◦\nC in FAST-PETase, instead of exhibiting increased flexibility at higher \ntemperature as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations. This effect was confirmed by physical \nenergy calculations, which suggest that temperature-dependent conformational changes of FAST-PETase \ndecrease the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G(stability)) and rigidify the enzyme at elevated temperatures \nenhancing stability. Looking forward, these findings might help guide the rational engineering of protein ther -\nmostability and contribute to our understanding of the thermal adaptation of thermophilic enzymes.\n1. Introduction\nTo achieve a circular economy, the ability to recycle the growing \namount of plastic waste is considered to be of high priority. [1] With PET \naccounting for around 12 % of the global solid waste volume (8 % by \nweight), the development of efficient and economical de- and repoly -\nmerization processes is therefore key. [2,3] One such PET depolymer -\nization strategy is the plastics ’ enzymatic hydrolysis, first reported in \n2005. [4,5] Although several enzymes with PET-hydrolyzing activities \nhave been identified, such as esterase, lipase and cutinase enzyme an -\nnotations, [6 – 9] expensive PET pretreatments are necessary to achieve \nacceptable depolymerizing activities with these promiscuous enzymes. \n[10 – 12] In 2016, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) was \nreported to be suitable for the operation at temperatures between 30 and \n50 \n◦\nC. [13] However, this enzyme was found to be poorly stable, with \nloss of activities after 24 hours incubation at 37 \n◦\nC. [14] Since PET \nbecomes more accessible near its glass transition temperature (65 – 75 \n◦\nC), [15] increasing T\nm \nand optimal operating temperature of Is PETase \nis desirable. Thus, several enzyme engineering strategies have been \napplied to optimize Is PETase ’ s utility by enhancing its thermostability, \nactivity and process conditions. [14,16 – 19] As a result, two stabilized \nvariants, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, were generated, which dis -\nplayed higher thermostability ( Δ T\nm \n10 and 30 \n◦\nC, respectively) and \nactivity at elevated temperatures ( > 60 \n◦\nC) but lower activity when mild \ntemperatures (30 – 50 \n◦\nC) were applied in depolymerization experiments. \n[14,16,20] Building on initial engineering attempts, Is PETase was \n* Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: ac4086@coventry.ac.uk (S.

The mutated Fast_S269T variant showed enhanced catalytic\nefficiency across a pH range of 6-10, notably doubling its performance at pH 8 compared to\nFastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 9). Analogously, we applied the same S269T mutation to\nother IsPETase variants, i.e., ThermoPETase, HotPETase and DepoPETase, to see if this\nmutation exhibited universal effects (Fig. 4a). Similarly as with FastPETase, catalytic\nenhancements were observed in ThermoPETase across 30, 40 and 50℃ in pH 8 and 9\nconditions.

Thus, to compare PET hydrolysis by Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase \nover a broad range of temperatures, we designed a product-deficient in-situ dialysis system to \nmaintain the pH at 8.0 and keep the level of hydrolysis products low. This system was applied \nto PET hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 10), which showed that the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Z1-PETase was higher than that of Z2-PETase across the entire temperature range \nfrom 30°C to 60°C, although the optimal temperatures of these two variants were different (Fig. \n4c–f). These results suggest that maintaining or enhancing the high activity of mesophilic PET \nhydrolase is critical for the development of a high-performance PET hydrolase with enhanced \nthermostability, and consequentially, we selected Z1-PETase as the IsPETase variant with the \nhighest PET depolymerizing activity among the tested combinatorial variants.  \nWe then compared the PET depolymerizing activity of Z1-PETase with those of other \nengineered PET hydrolases such as LC-CICCG, Dura-PETase, and Fast-PETase, and surprisingly, \nZ1-PETase kinetically outperforms LC-CICCG and Dura-PETase at all temperatures tested and \nexhibits high depolymerization rates (76.9%–90.1%) (Fig. 4c–f).

Interestingly, the PET depolymerizing \nactivity of Dura-PETase was much lower than that of Z1-PETase at all temperature ranges (Fig. \n4c-f), although the thermostability of these IsPETase variants was similar.

The lag phase of film decomposition was much longer \nthan that of powder decomposition at the same temperature (Fig. 4 d, e, g), suggesting that the \navailability of the PET surface for enzyme adsorption determines the initial depolymerization \nrate. \n \nDepolymerization of post-consumer PET powder using a pH-stat bioreactor  \nWe evaluated the industrial application of Z1-PETase by studying  PET plastic \ndepolymerization using a pH-stat bioreactor. We used transparent post-consumer PET powder \noriginated from transparent PET flakes collected in Daegu, Korea as the substrate (Fig. 5a and \nSupplementary Fig. 11). When the bioreactor was operated at 40°C under the pH-8.0 stationary \ncondition with 2.5% (w/v) of the substrate, 50% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 8 h, \nand 92.5% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 24 h  (Fig. 5b) . At 55°C, the initial \ndepolymerization rate was much higher than that at 40°C, demonstrating the thermal effect on \nPET degradation. At 55°C, 50% and 93% of the PET powder were depolymerized in 2 h and 8 \nh, respectively  (Fig. 5b).  This corresponds to a specific productivity value of 5.2 \ngmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1, with a maximum rate of 17.2 gmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1 observed \nin the early phase of the reaction. Due to the high activity and stability of Z1-PETase, the final \ndepolymerization rates of PET powder at 40°C and 55°C were not significantly different from \neach other (Fig. 5b).  \nIt should be noted  that colored PET plastics, such as brown plastic  beer bottles, are \ndifficult to recycle because they contain impurities, such as pigments, nylon and iron.
