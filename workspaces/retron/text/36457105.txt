RESEARCH
Population structure of an Antarctic aquatic 
cyanobacterium
Pratibha Panwar, Timothy J. Williams, Michelle A. Allen and Ricardo Cavicchioli* 
Abstract 
Background: Ace Lake is a marine-derived, stratified lake in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica with an upper oxic 
and lower anoxic zone. Cyanobacteria are known to reside throughout the water column. A Synechococcus-like spe-
cies becomes the most abundant member in the upper sunlit waters during summer while persisting annually even 
in the absence of sunlight and at depth in the anoxic zone. Here, we analysed ~ 300 Gb of Ace Lake metagenome 
data including 59 Synechococcus-like metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to determine depth-related variation 
in cyanobacterial population structure. Metagenome data were also analysed to investigate viruses associated with 
this cyanobacterium and the host’s capacity to defend against or evade viruses.
Results: A single Synechococcus-like species was found to exist in Ace Lake, Candidatus Regnicoccus frigidus sp. nov., 
consisting of one phylotype more abundant in the oxic zone and a second phylotype prevalent in the oxic-anoxic 
interface and surrounding depths. An important aspect of genomic variation pertained to nitrogen utilisation, with 
the capacity to perform cyanide assimilation and asparagine synthesis reflecting the depth distribution of available 
sources of nitrogen. Both specialist (host specific) and generalist (broad host range) viruses were identified with a 
predicted ability to infect Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus. Host-virus interactions were characterised by a depth-dependent 
distribution of virus type (e.g. highest abundance of specialist viruses in the oxic zone) and host phylotype capacity 
to defend against (e.g. restriction-modification, retron and BREX systems) and evade viruses (cell surface proteins and 
cell wall biosynthesis and modification enzymes).
Conclusion: In Ace Lake, specific environmental factors such as the seasonal availability of sunlight affects microbial 
abundances and the associated processes that the microbial community performs. Here, we find that the population 
structure for Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus has evolved differently to the other dominant phototroph in the lake, Candida-
tus Chlorobium antarcticum. The geography (i.e. Antarctica), limnology (e.g. stratification) and abiotic (e.g. sunlight) 
and biotic (e.g. microbial interactions) factors determine the types of niches that develop in the lake. While the lake 
community has become increasingly well studied, metagenome-based studies are revealing that niche adaptation 
can take many paths; these paths need to be determined in order to make reasonable predictions about the conse-
quences of future ecosystem perturbations.

Background
The Synechococcus genus consists of unicellular

of aquatic environments. Together with Prochloro -

photoautotrophs in marine environments and contrib -
ute significantly to global primary production [1 –3].
Characterising Synechococcus species has proven 
difficult because many have very similar morphology 
despite possessing distinct GC content, and the poly -
phyly of organisms classified as Synechococcus has been 
well noted [4 , 5]. Molecular markers successfully used 
to characterise the phylogeny of Synechococcus spe -
cies include the 16S–23S rRNA internally transcribed 
spacer region and the DNA-directed RNA polymerase 
(rpoC1), nitrate reductase (narB), nitrogen regulator 
(ntcA), phycoerythrin (cpeB) and cytochrome b6 (petB) 
genes [6 –12]. To date, more than 20 marine Synecho -
coccus clades have been identified using these mark -
ers [11– 15]. A recent study using the GTDB (Genome 
Taxonomy Database) approach [16] with additional 
phylogenomic analysis has reassigned 1085 members of 
the Synechococcus genus (also referred to as the ‘Syn -
echococcus collective’) to 15 genera within five distinct 
orders: (i) Synechococcales (composed of nine genera 
including Synechococcus genus and a monophyletic 
group of three genera Regnicoccus, Cyanobium and 
Vulcanococcus), (ii) Cyanobacteriales (one genus), (iii) 
Leptococcales (two genera), (iv) Thermosynechococ -
cales (two genera) and (v) Neosynechococcales (one 
genus) [5 ]. Synechococcus ecotypes in marine environ -
ments have been determined to be influenced by envi -
ronmental factors (e.g. iron concentration and sunlight 
availability), and genetic variation has been linked to 
the capacity to utilise sunlight (including chlorophyll a 
concentration), metabolise nitrogen and adapt to spe -
cific temperatures and salinity [13, 15, 17, 18].
In Antarctica, the polar sunlight cycle produces peri -
ods of 24-h sunlight in summer and 24-h darkness in 
winter. Despite the continuous availability of sunlight in 
summer, metagenomic analyses have determined that 
the abundance of Synechococcus is low or undetectable in 
the Southern Ocean south of the polar front [19–21]. In 
contrast, in marine-derived Ace Lake (Vestfold Hills, East 
Antarctica), a cyanobacterium related to Synechococcus 
(hereafter referred to as Synechococcus-like) can bloom 
to high levels [22–25]. Ace Lake is stratified (meromic -
tic) with a mixed upper oxic zone (mixolimnion) and a 
stagnant bottom anoxic zone (monimolimnion) that 
are separated by an oxic-anoxic interface (Fig.  1a) [22, 
25–27]. At the oxic-anoxic interface, below the depth at 
which cyanobacteria bloom, another phototroph, Candi-
datus Chlorobium antarcticum (green sulphur bacteria), 
thrives, producing considerable biomass (e.g. >  108 cell 
 ml−1). The predominance of these two types of phototro -
phs illustrates the importance that sunlight energy can 
play in sustaining specific Antarctic, microbially domi -
nated ecosystems [22–25, 28, 29].
As for other Synechococcus species, studying the eco -
physiology of Ace Lake Synechococcus-like species 
has proved challenging, with cultivation and isolation 
attempts not achieving axenic cultures; however, a non-
axenic culture was obtained and extensively characterised 
[23]. Subsequent cultivation of this non-axenic culture 
and DNA sequencing resulted in a genome sequence for 
Synechococcus sp. CS-601 (SynAce01), enabling adaptive 
traits to be inferred based on comparative genomics [30].
Phylogenetic analyses have placed the Ace Lake cyano -
bacterium in Marine cluster 5.2 with Synechococcus 
sourced from the water column of neighbouring lakes in 
the Vestfold Hills: Lake Abraxas and Pendant Lake [23, 
30]. Synechococcus-like cyanobacterial species have also 
been reported from other Antarctic aquatic and ter -
restrial environments, including microbial mats from 
Highway Lake in the Vestfold Hills, Firelight Lake in the 
Bølingen Islands [31] and Lake 59b, Lake Reid and Heart 
Lake in the Larsemann Hills [32, 33]; lakes in northern 
Victoria Land [34]; the littoral zone of Lundström Lake 
in the Shackleton Range [35]; lithic substrates from McK-
elvey Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys [36]; and weathered 
granite from Miers Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys [37].
Expeditions to retrieve samples from Ace Lake for 
metaproteogenomics first occurred in the austral sum -
mer 2006/2007, and subsequently in 2008/2009, with 
samples covering a complete seasonal cycle obtained in 
2013–2015; biomass was collected by sequential size 
fractionation onto 3.0-, 0.8- and 0.1-μm pore-sized filters, 
with the metagenome data generated enabling the char -
acterisation of diverse lake microorganisms [24, 25, 28, 
29, 38, 39]. The abundance of Synechococcus-like opera -
tional taxonomic units (OTUs) was assessed according 
to filter fraction, lake depth and season (Fig.  1b) [24, 25]. 
Synechococcus-like OTUs were present primarily in the 
3–20 and 0.8–3  μm filter fractions and were detected 
at all lake depths sampled; a fermentative capacity was 
inferred to enable the Ace Lake Synechococcus-like spe -
cies to persist (in low abundance) in the dark, anoxic 
zone and throughout the water column during periods 
when sunlight is absent (e.g. winter) [25]. Highest Syn -
echococcus-like OTU abundance occurred in the oxic 
zone in summer (≤ 58% of OTUs in a metagenome), with 
levels reduced in early winter (≤ 6%) and re-established 
in late winter (≤ 16%) and spring (≤ 51%); the seasonal 
abundance dynamics were linked to changes in tempera -
ture and available sunlight [23, 25].
To date, genomic variation of Ace Lake Synechococcus-
like species has not been investigated. However, varia -
tion may conceivably occur in response to changes in 
depth which affects dissolved oxygen (DO) concentra -
tion, salinity (increases with depth below the oxic-anoxic 
interface) and sunlight (decreases with depth and does

not penetrate the oxic-anoxic interface) (Fig.  1a), as well 
as in response to microbial interactions, including with 
viruses. To assess this, metagenomic reads were mapped 
to Synechococcus-like metagenome-assembled genomes 
(MAGs) enabling single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), indels (insertion/deletion of multiple bases) 
and variable coverage regions (VCRs) to be assessed; an 
approach that has proven successful for studies of other 
Antarctic species including haloarchaea and Ca . Chlo -
robium antarcticum [29, 40–43]. Here, we interrogated 
variation of two Ace Lake Synechococcus-like MAGs 
that had different 16S rRNA gene sequences (one each 
from the oxic zone and anoxic zone) by using Ace Lake 
metagenomes representing a time and depth series to 
(i) investigate genomic variation in the Synechococcus-
like species populations from different seasons (summer 
vs winter vs spring) and lake depths (oxic vs oxic-anoxic 
interface vs anoxic) to identify potential phylotypes and 
ecotypes, (ii) analyse defence genes and potential viral 
predators of the Synechococcus-like species to under -
stand their host-virus interactions and (iii) evaluate the 
potential factors that might have driven the development 
of the Synechococcus-like species ecotypes.
Results and discussion
Overview of Ace Lake metagenomes 
and Synechococcus‑like MAGs
A total of 120 time-series Ace Lake metagenomes from 
summer (Jan, Feb, Dec), winter (Jul, Aug) and spring 
(Oct, Nov), sampled from seven lake depths (surface, 
oxic 1, 2 and 3, interface, and anoxic 1, 2 and 3) and 11 
time periods (spanning 2006, 2008 and 2013–2015), were 
used for analyses (Fig.  1a; Additional file  1: Table  S1). 
For fragment recruitment (FR) analysis, 60 metagen -
omes (302  Gb), in which Synechococcus-like OTU rela -
tive abundance was ≥ 1% [25], were used to generate 30 
merged metagenomes by pooling reads from 3-20 and 
0.8–3  μm filter metagenomes that represented specific 
depths and time periods (Additional file  1: Table S1). For 
viral analysis, 39,287 Ace Lake viral contigs (724  Mb) 
from the Antarctic virus catalogue [25, 44] were used to 
identify potential viruses associated with the Synechococ-
cus-like species.
A total of 59 high- or medium-quality MAGs gen -
erated from Ace Lake metagenomes (one MAG per 
metagenome) were analysed (Additional file  2: Data -
set S1), of which 25 MAGs were ≥ 99% complete. IMG 
(Integrated Microbial Genomes) taxonomy classified 
all the MAGs as SynAce01. Together, the Synechococ -
cus-like MAGs consisted of 6681 contigs that encoded 
176,198 genes. For FR analysis, two Synechococcus-like 
MAGs were used: one from the Jul 2014, 5 m depth (oxic 
1), 3–20  μm filter metagenome (MAG-AL1), and one 
from the Dec 2014, 14 m depth (anoxic 1), 3–20 μm fil -
ter metagenome (MAG-AL2). MAG-AL1 contained 64 
contigs, 2929 genes, was 99.7% complete (2,644,322  bp) 
with 0.09% contamination and was selected for its high 
bin completeness and lowest bin contamination. MAG-
AL2 contained 120 contigs, 2956 genes, was 97% com -
plete (2,654,228  bp) with 0.63% contamination and was 
selected because it contained a distinct 16S rRNA gene 
sequence (Additional file  1: Table  S2; Additional file  2: 
Dataset S1).
Synechococcus‑like species phylotypes in Ace Lake
A total of 18 full-length (1489 bp) 16S rRNA genes were 
identified in Synechococcus-like MAGs; they were iden -
tical except for the MAG-AL2 gene which distinguished 
it as a separate phylotype from MAG-AL1 (and all other 
MAGs) by having two SNPs: 217 A-T and 231 G-T 
(Fig.  2; Additional file  1: Fig. S1a). By recruiting reads 
from the merged metagenomes to the two reference 
MAGs (MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2), the two SNPs at 
positions 217 and 231 (i.e. the MAG-AL2 transversions) 
were determined to be present in all Ace Lake merged 
metagenomes (Additional file 1: Table S3).
The IMG genome of SynAce01 [30] contains two full-
length 16S rRNA genes. MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 each 
contain one full-length 16S rRNA gene, and MAG-AL2 
contains an additional incomplete 16S rRNA gene (see 
supplementary text). The ratio between 16S rRNA SNPs 
median read depth (from 100% identity FR) and the 
read depth of its respective MAG was ~ 2 (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S2), indicating that each MAG contained two 
very similar 16S rRNA genes, similar to SynAce01. By 
comparison, the read depth ratio for Ca . Chlorobium

MAG-AL2 and the two SynAce01 genes (arbitraily assigned ‘gene 1’ and ‘gene 2’). See Additional file 1: Fig. S1a for the full-length alignment of the 
four genes

antarcticum, which contains one 16S rRNA gene [29], 
was ~ 1 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).
The two 16S rRNAs from SynAce01 are not identical. 
Both genes had 217  T (as for MAG-AL2), while ‘gene 
1’ had 231 G (as for MAG-AL1) and ‘gene 2’ had a base 
missing at position 231 (possibly an assembly error) 
(Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). The read depths for the 
two SNP markers for gene 1 were different (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S3f), and only one read in all the metagenome 
data matched both SNP markers of gene 1. Due to the 
difficulties of isolating an axenic and non-clonal strain 
(see above and Ref. [23]), it is possible that the SynAce01 
genome represents two or more closely related Synecho -
coccus-like strains. In support of this, FR analyses of the 
original NCBI SRA SynAce01 reads to SynAce01 16S 
rRNA genes revealed read sequences with either 217 A 
plus 231 G (as for MAG-AL1) or 217 T plus 231 T (as for 
MAG-AL2). For all these reasons, the SynAce01 genome 
was not used for assessments of population variation 
(further discussion is provided in supplementary text).
The SNP markers (217 A-T plus 231 G-T) were used to 
evaluate the contributions of the MAG-AL1 and MAG-
AL2 phylotypes to the total Synechococcus-like species 
population (Fig. 3a; Additional file  1: Table S4). The rela-
tive contribution of the two phylotypes varied with depth 
and season. In all metagenomes, the MAG-AL1 phylo -
type contributed the most to the Synechococcus-like spe -
cies population, with highest representation in the oxic 
zone. The MAG-AL2 phylotype had highest representa -
tion (almost 50% of the total Synechococcus-like species 
population) in the oxic-anoxic interface or anoxic 1 depth 
(Fig. 3a).
The relative contributions of MAG-AL1 and MAG-
AL2 were used to calculate their abundances in Ace Lake 
highlighting their distribution throughout the water 
column (Fig.  3b). The highest abundance of MAG-AL2 
in each time period occurred at different depths, with 
it being prevalent at the oxic-anoxic interface and sur -
rounding depths. This suggested that MAG-AL2 signa -
tures from the anoxic depths might not be from dead 
cells.
In addition to the two SNPs that define MAG-AL1 
and MAG-AL2, seven additional SNPs were identi -
fied in three oxic zone metagenomes (Additional file  1: 
Table S3). These seven SNPs might be indicative of other 
Synechococcus-like species phylotypes (distinct from 
MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2) in the oxic zone, particularly 
in surface waters, where SNP frequencies were higher 
(21–25%) than in oxic 1 (16–19%) and oxic 2 (3–5%) 
(Additional file 1: Table S3).
Phylogeny and global representation of Ace Lake 
Synechococcus‑like species
In addition to the high identity between 16S rRNA genes 
from MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 (99.9% identity), the 
average nucleotide identity (ANI: 99.6% over 92% align -
ment fraction), average amino acid identity (AAI: 99.3% 
over 90% alignment fraction) and digital DNA-DNA 
hybridisation (dDDH: 97%) were high (Additional file  1: 
Figs. S1 and S4), indicating that these two phylotypes 
belonged to the same species and subspecies.
Phylogenetic tree construction based on 16S rRNA 
genes and whole proteome content (Fig.  4), and ANI 
and AAI analyses of closely related MAGs and reference 
genomes obtained from GTDB (Additional file 3: Dataset 
S2) demonstrated that Ace Lake cyanobacterial genomes 
(SynAce01, MAG-AL1, MAG-AL2) formed a tight clade 
with ≤ 82% ANI and ≤ 79% AAI to other taxa. The MAG-
AL1 and MAG-AL2 16S rRNA genes had ≤ 98% iden-
tity to 16S rRNA genes available in databases from IMG 
publicly assembled metagenomes and public isolates 
(Additional file 3: Dataset S2). The closest non-Antarctic 
species (≤ 98% identity) included Synechococcus sp. 1G10 
(Nahuel Huapia Lake, Argentina), Synechococcus sp. 
MW101C3 (Lake Mondsee, Austria) and Synechococcus 
sp. WH5701 (Long Island Sound, New York; Ref. [45]). 
Each of these species, along with SynAce01 from Ace 
Lake, has recently been placed in the novel genus Reg -
nicoccus [5]. The 16S rRNA genes of Synechococcus from 
Lake Abraxas and Pendant Lake (Vestfold Hills; Ref. [30]) 
were ≤ 98% identical to the MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
sequences. Based upon these data, the Ace Lake cyano -
bacterium appears to represent a distinct species that is 
possibly confined to this water body. This contrasts with 
the green sulphur bacterium, Ca.  Chlorobium antarcti -
cum, which has an identical 16S rRNA gene sequence 
from Ace Lake, Taynaya Bay and Ellis Fjord [29]. In 
view of the phylogenetic characteristics of the Ace Lake 
cyanobacterium, we name a new Ace Lake species: Can -
didatus Regnicoccus frigidus sp. nov. (from fri’gi.dus. 
L. masc. adj. frigidum cold, referring to the cold envi -
ronment) (type MAG MAG-AL1: GenBank accession 
ID = JAOANE000000000; IMG bin ID = 3300023237_10; 
99.7% complete; 0.09% contamination) (Additional file  2: 
Dataset S1).
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population variation
SNPs (variant frequency ≥ 0.9), indels (read depth ≥ 20) 
and VCRs (significance of gene coverage variation 
assessed using DESeq2) were identified from FR of reads 
that represented different lake depths and time periods to 
MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 (Fig. 5; Additional file 4: Data-
set S3). Variation was lower in MAG-AL1 (75 SNPs and 
Page 6 of 22Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 
17 indels from 45 genes) than MAG-AL2 (572 SNPs and 
27 indels from 157 genes) (Additional file 4: Dataset S3).
SNPs and indels were identified in genes involved in 
cell wall or membrane biosynthesis and modification, 
transport, translation, carbohydrate metabolism, amino 
acid biosynthesis and other metabolic processes, as well 
as some hypothetical genes (Additional file  4: Dataset 
S3). Only a few SNPs and indels from each MAG were 
consistently represented across metagenomes from 
different time periods of the same depth (Additional 
file  4: Dataset S3; further discussed in supplementary 
text). This indicated that most Ca.  Regnicoccus frigi -
dus mutations were not stable, with the temporal vari -
ation observed being indicative of a relatively dynamic 
population. The mutations in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
genes were observed mainly in the anoxic and oxic depth 
metagenomes, respectively (Additional file  4: Data -
set S3). MAG-AL1 genes containing stable mutations

included the following: a glycosyltransferase (cell wall 
modification) and 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase 
(branched-chain amino acids degradation) (Additional 
file  4: Dataset S3). MAG-AL2 genes with stable muta -
tions encoded the following: carboxysome shell carbonic 
anhydrase (carbon dioxide fixation); a vitamin K epoxide 
reductase family protein (post-translational modifica -
tion); glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (glycerolipid 
synthesis); N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate dea -
cetylase (cell wall synthesis and glycolysis); a glycosyl -
transferase (cell wall modification); UDP-glucuronate 
decarboxylase (cell wall modification); and four hypo -
thetical proteins (Additional file 4 : Dataset S3).
Most variable coverage genes (VCGs) with significant 
coverage variation were of unknown function, i.e. hypo -
thetical or uncharacterized proteins, poorly character -
ized or coded for mobile elements (Additional file  4: 
Dataset S3). The remainder were genes involved in the 
following: cell wall or membrane biosynthesis and modi -
fication, transport, stress response, cell defence, cyanide 
assimilation and other metabolic functions (Additional 
file  4: Dataset S3). Significant gene variations were 
only identified for comparisons by depth, specifically 
oxic vs anoxic and oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface (Fig.  6; 
Additional file  4: Dataset S3). Most VCGs with similar 
function had distinct sequences in MAG-AL1 and MAG-
AL2, with the depth-dependent variation specific to each 
MAG: the VCGs had higher coverage in the oxic zone 
for MAG-AL1 and higher coverage in the oxic-anoxic 
interface and anoxic zone for MAG-AL2 (Figs.  5 and 6; 
Additional file  4: Dataset S3). This pattern of coverage 
matched phylotype abundance, with MAG-AL1 more 
prevalent in the oxic zone and MAG-AL2 more so in the 
oxic-anoxic interface and surrounding depths (Fig.  3b;

taken from their MAG bins in IMG (MAG-AL1, 3300023237_10; MAG-AL2, 3300023253_6). Trees are drawn to scale, with scale bars indicating branch 
lengths. The numbers at nodes are Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny pseudo-bootstrap support values > 70% from 100 replications, with an 
average branch support of 52.9% (a) or 93.6% (b). Ace Lake cyanobacteria are highlighted. Regnicoccus sp. Ace-Pa (or Synechococcus sp. Ace-Pa) is 
an unpublished, draft genome assembled from the same Ace Lake cyanobacterial isolate as SynAce01 (here Regnicoccus sp. SynAce01) and was not 
used for analyses

Fig. 5 Genomic variation in Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population. Circos plots depict the distribution of relative coverages of genes in a MAG-AL1 
and b MAG-AL2, in merged metagenomes from various Ace Lake depths and time periods (see Additional file 1: Table S4 for merged metagenome 
descriptions). The x-axes are shown on the outermost annuli: beginning of every contig, red tick; 10 kb length, grey tick. The annuli are first 
segregated by lake depth (surface, 0 m; oxic 1, 5 m; oxic 2, 12–13 m; interface: 13–15 m; anoxic 1, 14–16 m; anoxic 2, 18–19 m; anoxic 3, 23–24 m) 
and then arranged by season (summer: Jan, Dec; winter: Jul, Aug; spring: Oct, Nov). Metagenome reads with ambiguous mapping were allowed to 
map to the first best site, resulting in coverages of genes with multiple copies exceeding 100%; for display purposes, coverage was capped at 120%.

Additional file 1: Table S4). These data would be consist -
ent with niche adaptation, with MAG-AL1 and MAG-
AL2 possessing genetic capacities tailored to growth and 
survival in the oxic and anoxic zones, respectively (also 
see below in ‘Niche adaptation in Ace Lake’).
Alignments of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs 
revealed that contigs that did not align or had poor align-
ment tended to contain VCGs or putative viral genes 
(Additional file 5: Dataset S4). However, MAG-AL2 con -
tigs 118–120 did not match any other MAGs. These con -
tigs had low read depth in all metagenomes, and their 
gene relative coverages showed depth-dependent vari -
ation: oxic-anoxic interface and anoxic zone, < 24%, and 
oxic zone, ≤ 0.2% (Additional file  4: Dataset S3). Some 
of the genes on these contigs (e.g. glycine hydroxym -
ethyltransferase, ATP adenylyltransferase, bifunctional 
demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase/2-methoxy-
6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol methylase UbiE, murein 
DD-endopeptidase MepM/murein hydrolase activator 
NlpD, MFS family permeases, selenophosphate syn -
thetase) were present with normal coverage elsewhere in 
MAG-AL2, suggesting that all Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
populations studied possessed these functional traits.
The remaining low coverage genes represented Ca.  
Regnicoccus frigidus populations at the oxic-anoxic 
interface and in the anoxic zone that possessed a genetic 
capacity not present in the Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
populations in the oxic zone. Two genes annotated as 
a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) matura -
tion factor and a predicted RNA-binding protein con -
tained CooC and CooT domains, respectively; these are 
domains found in accessory proteins involved in the 
maturation of anaerobic CODH that occurs by the inser -
tion of nickel into the active site [46, 47]. No CODH 
genes were identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs, 
suggesting that the CooC and CooT domain-containing 
enzymes may function in anaerobic process(es) involving 
nickel-dependent pathways.
GC content of contigs was plotted against read depth 
to assess the presence of contig clusters representative 
of divergent (< 95% sequence similarity) Ca.  Regnicoc -
cus frigidus phylotypes (Additional file  1: Fig. S5). Taxo -
nomic analysis of 51,971 metagenome contigs adjacent

tent) revealed that only 297 metagenome contigs were

MAG-AL1 (a, c, e, g, i, k) and MAG-AL2 (b, d, f, h, j, l) gene coverages in samples from different lake depths (oxic, interface, anoxic) or seasons 
(summer, winter, spring). Each dot in a plot represents a MAG gene. The y-axes indicate the statistical significance (− log10 of P-value) of the change 
in gene coverage, with significance increasing from bottom to top: red dots, genes with fold change > 1 or <  − 1 and P ≤ 0.05; blue dots, genes 
with fold change between − 1 and 1 and P ≤ 0.05; black dots, genes with P > 0.05. The y-axis scale varies for each plot to enhance data visibility. See 
Additional file 4: Dataset S3 for a list of genes with significant fold changes. The x-axes indicate the magnitude of change (log2 of fold change) in 
gene coverage: positive fold change, gene coverage higher in samples taken as numerator; negative fold change, gene coverage higher in samples 
taken as denominator. For example, in the oxic vs anoxic plots (a) and (b), the oxic zone samples were considered as numerator, while the anoxic 
zone samples were taken as denominator. Therefore, the MAG-AL1 genes represented by red dots in a have significantly higher relative coverage in 
oxic zone samples, whereas the MAG-AL2 genes depicted by red dots in b have significantly higher relative coverage in anoxic zone samples. g–l 
No significant gene coverage variations were observed during comparison of seasonal samples (see further description in supplementary text)

classified as Cyanobacteria, and many of these had ≥ 99% 
identity matches to assembled Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
MAGs (Additional file  1: Table  S5; also see supplemen -
tary text ). The analyses indicate that Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus phylotypes with a high level of divergence (< 95% 
sequence similarity) were not abundant and, given the 
large size of the Ace Lake dataset, are not typical of the 
lake ecosystem.
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus viral contigs were identified in 
several ways (Additional file 6: Dataset S5): A) 31 in IMG/
VR v3 from Ace Lake metagenomes: vOTU_081954 (22), 
vOTU_248451 (7), Sg_292136 (1) and Sg_613705 (1). B) 
22 viral contigs aligned to the 59 Ca.  Regnicoccus frigi -
dus MAGs: vOTU_022592 (16) and Sg_256402 (1) from 
IMG/VR v3 and cl_2442 (2), cl_463 (1), sg_14817 (1) 
and sg_14822 (1) from the Antarctic virus catalogue. C) 
11 previously identified viral contigs based on matches 
to a cyanophage assembled from Ace Lake metagenome 
data: cl_6580 (2), cl_6727 (2), cl_9495 (1), cl_9892 (1), 
sg_14929 (1), sg_14949 (1), sg_14969 (1), sg_14971 (1) 
and sg_15003 (1) from the Antarctic virus catalogue [25]
The set of 22 and the set of 11 viral contigs contained 
genes that were taxonomically classified to a variety of 
microorganisms, indicating the viral contigs might rep -
resent generalist viruses that prey on multiple hosts. 
Five of the 22 viral contigs were present in two Ca.  Reg-
nicoccus frigidus MAGs, two verrucomicrobial MAGs 
and one actinobacterial MAG (Additional file  6: Dataset 
S5), indicating that these viral contigs likely represented 
prophages in the respective MAGs. The set of 31 viral 
contigs included three predicted prophages in IMG/VR 
v3 (Additional file 6: Dataset S5). Two of these prophages 
plus 10 other viral contigs aligned to some Ca.  Regnico-
ccus frigidus MAGs (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). The 
prediction of prophages is consistent with two prophage 
regions (phiSynAce1 and phiSynAce2) reported for the 
SynAce01 genome [30].
Overall, the data for these three sets of viral con -
tigs suggests that (i) vOTU_081954, vOTU_248451, 
Sg_292136 and Sg_613705 represent Ca. Regnicoccus 
frigidus specialist viruses, some of which are prophages; 
(ii) Sg_717548 and Sg_723842 (and nine viral contigs 
from the Antarctic virus catalogue) represent generalist 
viruses that prey on cyanobacteria; and (iii) Sg_256402 
and vOTU_022592 (and five viral contigs from the Ant -
arctic virus catalogue) likely represent generalist viruses 
that prey on an even broader range of hosts (Additional 
file 6: Dataset S5).
MAG-AL2 contained more predicted prophages than 
MAG-AL1, although the total viral gene composition 
for each MAG was similar (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). 
Gene coverage of the predicted MAG prophages was high 
(MAG-AL1 ≤ 7000 read depth; MAG-AL2 ≤ 8000) com-
pared to MAG read depths (both MAGs < 700) (Addi -
tional file  6: Dataset S5). The set of 31 Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus viral contigs had high coverage (< 6500), some of 
which belonged to Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs. The 
high coverage contigs are likely to represent viral prog -
eny of integrated (i.e. MAG prophage) or nonintegrated 
viruses associated with cells.
Searches for additional prophages in MAG-AL1 and 
MAG-AL2 were performed based on read coverage (i.e. 
high), gene composition and/or proximity to already 
predicted prophages. All prophages identified by this 
process were ≤ 19  kb in length, which is short by com -
parison to known cyanophages and therefore likely rep -
resent remnants of previous prophages (Additional file  6: 
Dataset S5). The MAG-AL2 prophage genes on contigs 
17, 106 and 111–116 had very low relative coverages in 
surface and oxic 1 (except Nov 2008) metagenomes com-
pared to metagenomes from deeper depths (Additional 
file  6: Dataset S5), possibly reflecting a greater loss of 
these prophage genes from the Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
population in the upper waters of the lake.
Host defence against viruses
Restriction-modification (RM) systems can be encoded 
by hosts and/or viruses and can impact host-virus inter -
actions in a variety of ways [41, 48–50]. The prophages 
within MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 contained a type 2 RM 
DNA methylase, with MAG-AL2 prophages also contain-
ing two type 1 RM DNA methylases (Additional file  6: 
Dataset S5). Type 2 RM methyltransferases have been 
associated with lysogenic lifestyles [49], which would be 
consistent with the prophage remnants arising from an 
integrated temperate virus. All subunit genes of a type 1 
RM system, and additional genes associated with RM sys-
tems (e.g. type 3 Res subunit domain), were also present 
outside of the prophages in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
and were therefore host-specific RM genes (Additional 
file 7: Dataset S6).
CRISPR-Cas system genes were not identified in Ca.  
Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs, consistent with previous 
findings for Ace Lake Synechococcus-like OTUs [25] 
and other marine cyanobacteria [51]. However, systems 
potentially involved in host-virus interactions included 
the DISARM (defence island system associated with 
restriction-modification) and retron systems. DISARM 
genes identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs 
were drmMII (DNA [cytosine-5]-methyltransferase) and 
drmD (SNF2 family DNA/RNA helicase), although genes 
constituting a complete system were not identified (Addi-
tional file 7: Dataset S6).

Retrons are often found near defence systems such as 
RM genes and afford viral defence via an ABI (abortive 
infection) mechanism and have previously been iden -
tified in cyanobacteria [52]. Bacterial retrons consist 
of a reverse transcriptase gene, a noncoding RNA and 
an effector gene which encodes a DNA-binding, HNH 
endonuclease, ribosyltransferase or two transmembrane 
(2TM) domains [52]. A reverse transcriptase gene con -
taining a bacterial retron domain was identified close 
to a type 1 RM system in MAG-AL1 (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). Most genes near 
the retron homologue were hypothetical genes and did 
not match known retron effector domains (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S6), although exostosin family protein domain 
(TM domain) and HicB antitoxin (which contains HTH 
domain; Refs. [53, 54]) genes were identified adjacent to 
retron homologs in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs and 
could possibly function as effector genes to constitute a 
functional retron anti-phage system.
Depth-dependent variation was observed for some of 
the above Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus defence genes (Addi -
tional file 7: Dataset S6). The MAG-AL1 retron homolog, 
drmMII, type 1 RM system (two S, one R and one M 
subunit) and three putative RM (two Uma2 family endo -
nucleases and one HNH family endonuclease) genes had 
higher coverage in the oxic zone than in the oxic-anoxic 
interface or anoxic zone (Fig.  7; Additional file  4: Data -
set S3; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). A similar pattern of 
variation occurred for MAG-AL2 drmMII, type 1 RM S 
subunit and putative RM (HNH family endonuclease) 
genes. Viruses are prevalent throughout Ace Lake, but 
abundance is highest in the oxic zone [25]. These afore -
mentioned systems that are overrepresented in the oxic 
zone may reflect a functionality particularly suited to 
responding to the specific viral population. In contrast, 
two type 1 RM R subunit genes and a putative RM gene 
(Uma2 family endonuclease) that were specific to MAG-
AL2 had 2 to 3 times higher coverage in the oxic-anoxic 
interface and anoxic zone than the oxic zone (Additional 
file 4: Dataset S3; Additional file 7: Dataset S6). As MAG-
AL2 is prevalent in the anoxic zone, the higher coverage 
for these defence systems suggests they are more specific 
to viruses enriched in the anoxic zone (Fig.  3; Additional 
file 7: Dataset S6).
Bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) type 1 system genes 
(brxC, brxB, brxA and truncated pglX and brxL) and 
additional BREX genes (brxHI, brxHII, pglW) were iden -
tified in both MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2, and pglZ and 
complete brxL (often together) were present in some 
other Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). The pglX gene was 
truncated in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2, and some Ca.  
Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs contained two truncated 
pglX genes that together constituted the full-length gene 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6; 
further discussed in supplementary text). A complete 
pglX cyanobacterial gene was also identified in Ace Lake 
contigs. Similar observations were made for Antarctic 
haloarchaea resident in Deep Lake (Vestfold Hills) [41]. 
Interruption of the pglX gene occurs in a diverse range 
of microorganisms with acquisition of the gene-by-gene 
transfer enabling the BREX system to be functional [56]. 
In addition to the variation in the integrity of the pglX 
gene, only a subset of Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs 
contained complete sequences of brxL and pglZ (core 
BREX gene) (Additional file 7: Dataset S6). Using a MAG 
that contained brxL and pglZ (99.7% bin completeness, 
3.6% bin contamination, Dec 2014, 12  m depth, 0.8-μm 
filter metagenome), both genes were found to have low 
relative coverages (≤ 25%) in all metagenomes, with cov -
erage significantly higher in the oxic-anoxic interface 
and anoxic zones than in the oxic zone (Additional file  4: 
Dataset S3). These data show depth-dependent variation 
for BREX genes, with less than a quarter of the Ca.  Reg-
nicoccus frigidus population possessing brxL and pglZ; 
that subpopulation would also need to possess (vertical 
inheritance) or acquire (gene transfer) a functional pglX 
gene in order to perform BREX-mediated viral resistance 
(Fig.  7). It therefore appears that the Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus population is limited in its ability to mount, at 
best, a transient BREX response.
Host evasion of viruses
Variation (VCRs, SNPs, indels) was a feature of a vari -
ety of genes encoding cell surface proteins (e.g. TolC 
and porins) or genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis 
(e.g. lipopolysaccharides) and modification (e.g. glyco -
syltransferases) (Additional file  4: Dataset S3). Viruses 
attach to cell surface components, including lipopolysac -
charides, TolC and porins [57]. The coverages of these 
VCGs involved in cell surface structures in MAG-AL1 
were significantly higher in the oxic zone than in the 
oxic-anoxic interface or anoxic zone, while the opposite 
trend occurred for MAG-AL2 (with the exception of a 
few glycosyltransferases). Moreover, the specific VCGs 
in MAG-AL1 differed to those in MAG-AL2, suggest -
ing that the cell wall composition of the Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus represented by the two MAGs was likely to differ 
(Additional file 4: Dataset S3).
SNPs and indels identified in some of the Ca.  Reg -
nicoccus frigidus glycosyltransferases (Additional 
file  4: Dataset S3) may impact cell wall composition 
by influencing substrate specificity of the enzymes 
and the type of sugar they incorporate during gly -
cosylation [58, 59]. Variation in glycosyltransferases 
Page 12 of 22Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 
and other cell surface proteins has been speculated 
to mediate viral evasion in Antarctic haloarchaea [41, 
43] and marine Prochlorococcus [ 60], and liposac -
charide modification has been shown to perturb viral 
infection of Anabaena sp. PCC7120 [61]. The types of 
genetic variation observed for Ca.  Regnicoccus frigi -
dus is therefore likely a response to interactions with 
viruses, particularly as a mechanism of evasion of spe -
cialist viruses that target specific epitopes during viral 
attachment (Fig. 7 ).

data (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table S4). Significant cor -
relations occurred between changes in MAG-AL1 
abundance and depth (Spearman’s rank correlation coef -
ficient ρ =  − 0.6, P = 0.003), DO (ρ = 0.5, P = 0.008) and 
salinity (ρ =  − 0.6, P = 0.003), but not lake temperature 
(ρ =  − 0.4, P = 0.1). In contrast, no significant correla -
tions occurred with MAG-AL2 abundance. Of these lake 
factors, salinity has previously been associated with the 
evolution of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus ecotypes 
in the South China Sea [17].
Significant depth-dependent variation in MAG-AL1 
and MAG-AL2 gene coverages was observed for oxic vs 
anoxic and oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface metagenomes 
(Fig.  6; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). The functional 
properties of the VCGs encoding metabolic functions 
were examined to assess what ecophysiological impact 
they may confer.
Cyanide assimilation
A Nit1C gene cluster (nitHBCDEFG; contig 33) was 
identified as a VCR in MAG-AL1, but not in MAG-
AL2 (Fig.  8a; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). This locus, 
which has previously been reported in cyanobacteria, 
belongs to branch 1 nitrilases that can function during 
nitrogen starvation to assimilate nitriles by hydrolys -
ing them to ammonia (plus a carboxylic acid) [62–67]. 
Nit1C gene expression can be highly induced by cyanide 
and repressed by ammonium and is essential for growth 
when cyanide is the sole source of nitrogen [64, 65, 67].
The Nit1C cluster had significantly higher coverage 
(P ≤ 0.0002) in the oxic zone (81%), compared to the oxic-
anoxic interface (41%) or anoxic zone (36%) (Fig.  8b and 
c; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). The littoral mats in Ace 
Lake contain diverse cyanobacteria as well as predatory 
ciliates and rotifers [22, 26], and the ability to produce 
cyanide is widespread among phylogenetically diverse 
cyanobacteria, possibly as a defence mechanism against 
grazers (e.g. ciliates, rotifers) [68]. It is therefore possi -
ble that the Ace Lake cyanobacteria in the littoral mats 
generate relatively high levels of free cyanide (HCN and 
 CN−) in the oxic zone, with cyanate generated by abiotic 
cyanide oxidation. The lower Nit1C cluster coverage in 
the anoxic zone is consistent with this zone having rela -
tively high levels of ammonium (which represses gene 
expression) [22, 64, 69, 70]. Cyanate transporter genes 
were not identified in MAG-AL1, but nitrate and nitrite 
transporters which were encoded could possibly function 
in the uptake of cyanate and cyanide [71, 72]. These data 
would be consistent with MAG-AL1 Nit1C genes being 
induced during nitrogen starvation and/or in the pres -
ence of cyanide, allowing Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus to 
assimilate free cyanide and nitriles as nitrogen sources. 
As bioavailable nitrogen is limiting in the oxic zone [22, 
70], the Nit1C gene cluster would be expected to enhance 
the competitiveness of the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus pop -
ulation that possess it.
Asparagine synthesis
The conversion of aspartate to asparagine can be cata -
lysed by AsnB (glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine syn -
thetase) using glutamine as the preferred substrate 
or ammonium [73]. An asnB  gene (IMG gene ID: 
Ga0222690_10005105) was identified in 18 Ca. Regnicoc-
cus frigidus MAGs (but not in MAG-AL1 or MAG-AL2). 
While the ammonium-dependent asparagine synthetase 
gene (asnA ) was not identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus MAGs, the capacity to use nitrate, nitrite and 
ammonia for glutamine production via the GS-GOGAT 
(glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase) cycle was evi -
dent in Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus (Fig. 7).
Using one MAG that contained asnB  (99.7% bin com -
pleteness, 3.6% bin contamination, Dec 2014, 12 m depth, 
0.8-μm filter metagenome), significant coverage variation 
was found between the anoxic zone (specifically anoxic 2 
and 3; average 22%) and the oxic-anoxic interface (6%) or 
the oxic zone (5%) (Fig.  9; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). 
In ammonium-rich environments, AsnB can catalyse the 
formation of asparagine [74], and may therefore enable 
the anoxic zone Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus population 
(where ammonium levels are high; Refs. [22, 69, 70]) to 
benefit by being able to assimilate ammonia using AsnB 
(Fig.  7). Conversely, in the nitrogen-limited oxic zone, 
by having a capacity to perform glutamine-dependent 
asparagine synthesis [75], the relatively small asnB  popu-
lation would be expected to have an improved capacity 
to utilise bioavailable nitrogen (Fig.  7). While less than 
half of the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population possessed 
asnB, the gene was consistently identified in metagen -

face, anoxic) and time (2008 to 2014), indicating it was a 
stable feature of the population (Fig. 9).
Conclusion
A Synechococcus-like species is the most abundant 
microorganism in the oxic zone of Ace Lake, where it 
blooms in response to available sunlight; it also persists 
in the oxic zone during long periods when sunlight is 
absent, as well as throughout the dark, anoxic depths of 
the lake [23–25]. Here, we have shown that a single Syn-
echococcus-like species, composed of two major phylo -
types (one more abundant than the other), colonises Ace 
Lake, and that the population composition varies with 
lake depth (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Tables S3, S4, S6). 
The new species Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus differs (≤ 98% 
16S rRNA identity) to all other characterized Synechoc -
occus and Synechococcus-like species, including others

from lakes in the neighbouring region. Members of the 
Synechococcus collective inhabit diverse aquatic and ter -
restrial habitats in Antarctica yet are rare members of the 
surrounding marine environment. Clearly, temperature 
alone is not an overriding factor that controls the ability 
of Synechococcus to colonise; in fact, the extent and diver-
sity of Antarctic habitat that supports growth of Synecho-
coccus testifies to the cyanobacteria having a capacity to 
adapt ‘happily’ to the Antarctic realm. In Ace Lake, the 
very abundant, phototrophic ‘neighbour’ of Ca.  Regnico-
ccus frigidus, Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum has evolved 
a remarkably coherent population structure that is con -
served across lake and stratified marine-basin ecosystems 
[29]. In contrast, based on 16S rRNA divergence, mem -
bers of the Synechococcus collective are characterized 
by more variability between aquatic systems, and based 
on analyses of MAGs, they are characterized as having a 
higher extent of phylotype diversification (at least within 
Ace Lake). The capacity to rigorously interrogate popu -
lation structure is predicated on having metagenome 
datasets that are of sufficient quality and size to gener -
ate MAGs and perform comparative analyses of specific

species in order to characterise individual taxa and moni-
tor variation (temporal, depth and so forth). What these 
studies of Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum and Ca. Regnico-
ccus frigidus reveal is the existence of distinct genomic/
adaptive characteristics, exemplifying the ways in which 
microbial lineages can and do evolve to otherwise ‘com -
mon’ (Antarctic) environmental conditions.
Notable characteristics of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus pop-
ulation included depth-related genomic variation: abun -
dance of the main phylotypes MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
and extent and nature of VCRs, SNPs and indels of each of 
these phylotypes (Figs. 3 and 5; Additional file 1: Table S4; 
Additional file 4: Dataset S3). Some types of genomic vari-
ability were characterized as being relatively dynamic (e.g. 
temporal change in SNPs and indels) and others relatively 
stable (e.g. VCRs). The specific genomic variation of the 
phylotypes (gene differences and representation in the 
population) described functional variation, in particular, 
molecular traits ascribing interactions of Ca. Regnicoccus 
frigidus with its complement of viruses and metabolic dis-
tinctions denoting ecotypes (Fig. 7).
Viruses have been speculated to drive evolution of 
marine cyanobacteria leading to the development of 
virus-susceptible and virus-resistant host populations 
and enabling co-existence of hosts and viruses [60, 76, 
77]. Viruses play particularly important roles in Antarc -
tic aquatic systems, in part due to the low abundance of 
larger trophic predators [27]. Similar to the interactions 
of viruses with marine cyanobacteria, complex host-virus 
interactions have been described for a number of Antarc-
tic microbially dominated systems [41, 78–86], includ -
ing for Ace Lake [24, 25, 29]. The current study provides 
specific data about the cell surface structures and defence 
systems that are likely to be important in evading or neu -
tralising viruses in order for Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus to 
grow successfully and persist throughout the water col -
umn of Ace Lake (Fig.  7; Additional file  4: Dataset S3; 
Additional file 7: Dataset S6).
The existence of Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus ecotypes 
with differing capacities for nitrogen utilisation (cya -
nide assimilation and glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine 
synthesis) could be rationalised within the context of 
available nitrogen in the lake. In Ace Lake, the overall 
atmospheric nitrogen level decreases with lake depth, 
being absent in anoxic waters below 18  m depth [69]. 
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus cannot fix atmospheric nitro -
gen. However, it can or is predicted to utilise a variety 
of nitrogen sources including nitrate, nitrite, ammonia,

cyanate, urea, peptides and amino acids [23, 25]. Bio -
available nitrogen is limiting in the oxic zone, but the 
anoxic zone is replete in ammonia and amino acids 
[22, 69, 70]. The Nit1C gene cluster in the abundant 
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype in the oxic zone 
(MAG-AL1; Fig.  3b) is inferred to confer an ability to 
utilise free cyanide and nitriles as additional nitrogen 
sources, thereby improving its competitiveness in the 
oxic zone (Figs.  7 and 8 ). Utilising a different strategy, 
the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus ecotype population con -
taining asnB was more prevalent in the anoxic zone 
(Fig.  9), which is inferred to augment the ability of the 
population to assimilate ammonia as a source of avail -
able nitrogen (Fig.  7). AsnB has been experimentally 
characterized as preferring glutamine as substrate over 
ammonia but in ammonia-rich environments to utilise 
exogenous ammonia as well [74]. Genomic reconstruc -
tion greatly advances knowledge of genomic potential 
and provides a focus for specific genomic characteristics 
‘of interest’ . Here, we nominate asnB as a gene worthy of 
experimental evaluation. While not a trivial undertak -
ing, as Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus has proven to be ame -
nable to laboratory cultivation (SynAce01; Ref. [23]), the 
opportunity exists to attempt to experimentally charac -
terise the enzyme and the cellular growth properties of 
the microorganism.
Methods
Sample collection, DNA sequencing and MAG generation
Sampling, DNA extraction, sequencing, assembly and 
annotation of 120 time-series Ace Lake metagenomes 
from 2006/2007, 2008/2009 and 2013–2015 have been 
described previously [25, 28, 38] (Additional file  1: 
Table  S1). Metagenome samples were obtained in sum -
mer (Jan, Dec, Feb), winter (Jul, Aug) and spring (Oct, 
Nov) from seven lake depths: surface, 0  m; oxic 1, 5  m; 
oxic 2, 12–13 m; interface, 13–15 m; anoxic 1, 14–16 m; 
anoxic 2, 18–19 m; and anoxic 3, 23–24 m (Fig.  1a; Addi-
tional file  1: Table S1). The specific oxic-anoxic interface 
depths (13–15 m) and the anoxic depths (14–16 m) vary 
depending on seasonal and temporal changes in the lake 
water level arising from the net balance between inputs 
and outputs [22, 87, 88]. Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs 
were generated from the metagenomes (only one MAG 
per metagenome) by the IMG pipeline. For MIMAG 
(minimum information about MAGs; Ref. [89]) data, the 
MAG contig statistics N50, L50 and maximum contig 
length were calculated using BBMap v38.51 [90]; all other 
MAG quality and metadata were taken from IMG (Addi -
tional file 2: Dataset S1).
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus genomic variation
Reads from 60 metagenomes in which Synechococcus-
like OTUs were identified were used for FR analyses 
(Additional file  1: Tables S1 and S4). Ace Lake 2006 
metagenomes were not included due to differences in 
the sequencing technology and possible dataset size bias 
compared to the Ace Lake 2008 and 2013–2015 metage -
nomes [29]. Metagenome reads from 0.8–3 and 3–20 μm 
filter fractions from each time period and depth were 
pooled to create 30 merged metagenomes using a previ -
ously described method [29]. As the relative abundance 
of Synechococcus-like OTU was ≤ 0.3% in all 0.1–0.8-μm 
filter fraction metagenomes [25], they were excluded 
from FR analyses. Anoxic zone metagenomes from win -
ter were not available due to sampling logistical con -
straints [25].
For the analysis of genomic variation in the Ca.  Reg -
nicoccus frigidus population, one MAG from the oxic 
zone and one MAG from the anoxic zone were selected: 
MAG-AL1 (IMG Bin ID: 3300023237_10), oxic zone, 
Jul 2014, 5  m depth, 3–20-μm filter fraction, 99.7% bin 
completeness and lowest bin contamination (0.09%); 
MAG-AL2 (IMG Bin ID: 3300023253_6), anoxic zone, 
Dec 2014, 14  m depth, 3–20-μm filter, 16S rRNA gene 
sequence different to MAG-AL1, high genome complete-
ness (97%), and low bin contamination (0.63%). Contig 
and scaffold arrangements of the two Ca. Regnicoccus 
frigidus MAGs that would best represent draft genomes 
were determined using previously described methods 
[29]. Nucleotide sequences from MAG-AL1, MAG-AL2 
and SynAce01 were used for manual rearrangement of 
contigs (Additional file 1: Table S2).
FR of metagenome reads to the two MAGs and cal -
culation of base coverages were performed as described 
previously [29]. SNPs were detected from FR output 
BAM files using Samtools v1.10 variant calling com -
mands bcftools mpileup and bcftools call [91, 92], with 
the –max-depth option adjusted to highest read depth 
observed in each metagenome. Variant call output files 
were further scanned using an in-house python script 
to identify SNPs with ≥ 90% frequency (i.e. at least 90% 
of the aligned reads contained the SNP) and insertion/
deletion of multiple bases (indels). Only SNPs and indels 
with read depth ≥ 20 were considered. Additionally, FR of 
reads to a Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG from Dec 2014, 
12 m depth and 0.8-μm filter metagenome (IMG bin ID: 
3300023227_3) was performed to assess the coverage 
variation of glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine synthetase 
(asnB), alkaline phosphatase (pglZ) and ATP-depend -
ent Lon protease (brxL) genes in Ace Lake merged 
metagenomes.
Differences in gene orders of MAGs were assessed by 
aligning the Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs of ≥ 97% 
Page 17 of 22
Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 
 
genome completeness to MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
using the blastn module of BLAST  + v2.11.0 [93]. Align-
ments were manually parsed to identify MAG contigs 
with no matches, low identity matches (< 80%), low align-
ment fraction matches (<  50% contig length aligned) or 
short length matches (< 1 kb alignment length).
GC content vs read depth analysis
GC content-read depth analysis was performed as 
described previously for Haloarchaea [ 39] and Ca. Chlo-
robium antarcticum [29]. Metagenome contigs of ≥ 10 kb 
length and 30–80% GC content, and Ca. Regnicoccus 
frigidus MAG contigs, were plotted using Python v3.6.4. 
The taxonomies of the metagenome contig clusters that 
were close to the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG con -
tig cluster (i.e. metagenome contigs with 45–80% GC 
content) were determined from the IMG phylodist file-
based contig taxonomies described previously [ 25]. 
These metagenome contigs were also aligned to Ca. 
Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs and the SynAce01 genome 
using blastn module of BLAST  + v2.9.0. Alignment files 
and taxonomies were manually parsed, and contigs with 
low identity (<  95%) and high alignment fraction (>  50%) 
matches were further assessed to identify other cyano -
bacteria in Ace Lake that might be distantly related to 
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus.
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype abundance
Median read depth of a Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG 
in a merged metagenome, calculated as median of read 
depth values of each base in a MAG, was used to repre -
sent Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population abundance in 
the metagenome. The abundance of a Ca. Regnicoccus 
frigidus gene in a merged metagenome was calculated as 
gene coverage using the formula as follows:
where the numerator indicates the sum of the read 
depths of the bases in the gene, in each merged metagen -
ome, and the denominator indicates the total number of 
bases in the gene.
To assess the proportion of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus 
population containing specific variable coverage genes, 
the gene relative coverages were calculated using the for -
mula as follows:
(Gene) Read depth of base
Total number of bases (Gene)
Gene coverage
Median read depth (MAG )
× 100
where MAG is MAG-AL1 or MAG-AL2. The numera -
tor is the coverage of a gene from a MAG, and the denomi-
nator indicates the median read depth of the MAG in a 
merged metagenome. For estimation of relative coverages 
of asnB, pglZ and brxL (complete sequence) genes, the 
median read depth was used for the MAG from which the 
genes were taken (see above in ‘ Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus 
genomic variation’). Average of relative coverages of gene(s) 
from a depth zone (oxic, oxic-anoxic interface, anoxic) 
was calculated by taking the mean of relative coverages of 
gene(s) in merged metagenomes from all depths and time 
periods in the zone.
ANI, AAI, 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analyses
The pairwise ANI of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs 
were performed using previously described methods [29]. 
AAI between MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 was estimated 
using AAI calculator online service [94, 95]. Furthermore, 
dDDH values and confidence intervals were calculated at 
the Type (Strain) Genome Server [ 96, 97] using the rec -
ommended settings of the Genome-to-Genome Distance 
Calculator 3.0 [ 98, 99]. SNPs were identified in the 16S 
rRNA genes of MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 using the FR 
data in the Integrative Genomics Viewer [ 100]. Of these, 
two SNPs at positions 217 and 231 were observed in both 
MAGs and in SynAce01 16S rRNAs in all merged metage-
nomes and were used as SNP markers. The frequencies 
of these SNPs, with read depths  ≥ 20, were used to calcu -
late the percentage contributions of the two MAGs to the 
overall Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population in a merged 
metagenome (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table  S4). Of the 
SNP frequencies at positions 217 and 231 in a MAG 16S 
rRNA gene in a merged metagenome, the smaller value 
was selected to reflect the percentage contribution of 
the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype. For example, 
in oxic 2, Nov 2008 metagenome, the SNP frequencies 
at positions 217 (T) and 231 (T) of MAG-AL1 (normal 
bases: 217 A plus 231 G) were 7 and 4%, respectively 
(Additional file  1: Table  S3). Here, the minimum value 
(4%) was selected to capture the percentage of reads that 
likely contained SNPs at both positions, and so the rela -
tive contribution of MAG-AL2 (normal bases: 217 T plus 
231  T) was estimated as 4% in this metagenome (Addi -
tional file  1: Table  S4). Furthermore, the read depths of 
the two MAGs were calculated in each metagenome by 
multiplying their percentage contribution and median 
read depth in a merged metagenome. Stringent FR of 
reads (with 100% identity) to 16S rRNAs from MAG-AL1, 
MAG-AL2 and SynAce01 was performed to evaluate if 
MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 represented distinct phylo -
types. The 16S rRNA copy number of the two MAGs was 
evaluated by calculating their read-depth ratios, i.e. 16S 
Page 18 of 22Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 
rRNA SNPs median read depth divided by correspond -
ing MAG read depth in each merged metagenome, and 
assessing their flanking gene annotations. The MAG 
read-depth ratios were compared to Ca . Chlorobium 
antarcticum 16S rRNA read-depth ratios as references, 
with ratios > 1 suggesting the presence of multiple cop -
ies. Global representation of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus was 
assessed by blastn of 16S rRNA genes from MAG-AL1 
and MAG-AL2 against 16S rRNA gene databases from 
IMG public-assembled metagenomes and public isolates 
(both databases accessed on 22 March 2022), using previ-
ously described methods [29]. The taxonomic novelty of 
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus was assessed through 16S rRNA 
gene and whole proteome phylogeny, along with ANI 
and AAI analyses. Closely related MAGs and genomes 
were selected based on the placement of the MAGs in the 
GTDB reference tree using GTDB-tk v2.1.0 with database 
R207_v2 [16, 101]. These closely related genomes, along 
with proposed cyanobacterial type strains [5 ], were uti -
lised for AAI analysis using CompareM v0.1.2 [102] and 
ANI analysis using fastANI v1.32 [103]. Pairwise com -
parisons of the whole genome, whole proteome and 16S 
rRNA gene sequences were calculated using the Genome 
BLAST Distance Phylogeny approach and distance 
formula d5 [98], as implemented at the Type (Strain) 
Genome Server. The resulting distances were used with 
FastME 2.1.6.1 [104] to infer balanced minimum evolu -
tion trees, and 100 pseudo-bootstrap replicates were per -
formed. Based on the observed taxonomic placement, a 
novel species name was proposed according to the Seq -
Code regulations [105]. Genomes of the two Ca . Reg -
nicoccus frigidus phylotypes were submitted to GenBank 
(accession IDs: MAG-AL1, JAOANE000000000; MAG-
AL2, JAOANF000000000), and the type MAG MAG-AL1 
was registered with SeqCode.
Statistical analyses
The significance of the differences in gene coverages from 
different depths (oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface vs anoxic) 
and seasons (summer vs winter vs spring) was assessed 
for MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 using the DESeq2 R pack -
age [106] on all MAG genes. For season comparison, the 
samples from various time periods were grouped as sum -
mer: Dec and Jan; winter: Jul and Aug; and spring: Oct 
and Nov. For depth comparison, the samples from differ -
ent lake depths were grouped as oxic: surface, oxic 1 and 
2; oxic-anoxic interface: interface; anoxic: anoxic 1, 2 and 
3. The parameters used for assessing significance from 
DESeq2 output were the same as described previously 
[29]. Genes with significant variations were considered as 
variable coverage genes, and their function was verified 
using previously described methods [29]. Read depths 
of MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 were used to assess the 
relationship between the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylo-
type abundances and the physicochemical characteristics 
of Ace Lake such as depth, salinity, DO and temperature 
[25] (Additional file  1: Table  S4). The DO values meas -
ured using a YSI Sonde in 2008 and a TOA WQC in 2013 
and 2014 were normalised, as described previously [25]. 
Lake temperature and DO values were not available for 
certain time periods (Jul 2014 and Jan 2015); therefore, 
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype abundance data were 
taken only from merged metagenomes for which all envi-
ronmental data were available. Spearman’s rank correla -
tion coefficients (ρ) were manually calculated between 
lake characteristics (depth, salinity, DO or tempera -
ture) and Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG (MAG-AL1 or 
MAG-AL2) read depths. For this, the MAG read depths 
and lake characteristics were first ranked individually, 
and then a Pearson product moment correlation coeffi -
cient was calculated from the rank values. Statistical sig -
nificance of the correlation was calculated using ANOVA 
(analysis of variance) regression analysis.
Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses
A list of viral contigs potentially associated with Ca.  
Regnicoccus frigidus was prepared by the following: (i) 
searching the IMG/VR v3 database (accessed on 28 June 
2021) [107] to identify Ace Lake viral contigs with Syn -
echococcus as their predicted host, (ii) including viral 
contigs in the Antarctic virus catalogue [44] that matched 
a cyanophage assembled from an Ace Lake metagenome 
(Additional file 4: Table S4 from Ref. [25]) and (iii) align -
ing the Antarctic virus catalogue contigs to the contigs 
from all Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs (Additional 
file 2: Dataset S1) to identify viral clusters or singletons 
with sequence similarity to Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
host genomes (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). Antarc -
tic virus catalogue contigs from Ace Lake are hosted on 
IMG in the public scaffold set ‘ Antarctic_Virus_cata -
logue_2020_Ace_lake’ . Alignment was performed using 
the blastn module of BLAST + v2.11.0, and only viral 
contigs with > 95% identity matches were considered for 
further analysis. The cluster or singleton assignments of 
the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses were gathered from 
IMG/VR v3 database and the Antarctic virus catalogue. 
Additionally, putative prophage regions in MAG-AL1 
and MAG-AL2 were identified by aligning MAG con -
tigs to potential Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus viral contigs 
(determined from the three approaches described above) 
and two SynAce01 prophage sequences (phiSynAce1 
and phiSynAce2; Ref. [30]) using the blastn module of 
BLAST + v2.11.0. Only contig regions with > 95% identity 
matches to multiple viral sequences were considered as 
putative prophage sequences in the two Ca.  Regnicoccus 
frigidus MAGs.

Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus defence genes
IMG gene annotations of MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 
were manually parsed to identify auto-annotated defence 
genes associated with RM system, DISARM, BREX sys -
tem and ABI mechanism (including a retron homo -
logue). The functions of these defence genes were verified 
through manual annotation, as described previously [29]. 
The presence/absence of additional BREX system genes 
(brxD, brxE, brxF, brxHI, brxHII, brxL, brxP, pglW, pglX, 
pglXI, pglY, pglZ), DISARM genes (drmA , drmB, drmC, 
drmD, drmE) and ABI mechanism genes (toxI, toxN, 
abiEi, abiEii, rnlA, rnlB) in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus 
MAGs were determined through matches of MAG pro -
teins to reference proteins taken from previous publica -
tions (BREX genes from Ref. [56]) or NCBI. The Blastp 
module of DIAMOND v0.9.31 [108] was used for align -
ment, and only alignments with e-value <  10−5, protein 
identity > 30% and MAG protein coverage > 50% were 
considered.
