Precise genome editing without exogenous
donor DNA via retron editing system in human
cells
Dear Editor ,
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated seamless genome editing can be
achieved by incorporating donor DNA into the CRISPR-Cas9
target loci via homology-directed repair (HDR), albeit with
relative low ef ﬁciency due to the inef ﬁcient delivery of
exogenous DNA (Cox et al., 2015; Gao, 2021). Retrons are
bacterial phage-defense related operons composed of a
specialized reverse transcriptase (RT) and a relevant non-
coding RNA (ncRNA) which can be partially reverse tran-
scribed by RT initiating at a conserved guanosine
(G) residue to produce a multicopy single-stranded DNA
(msDNA) (Yee et al., 1984; Millman et al., 2020). After being
reverse transcribed, the msDNA is usually covalently teth-
ered to the ncRNA through the 2 ′,5′-phosphodiester bond
between the priming G in ncRNA and 5 ′ end of msDNA
(Dhundale et al., 1987). The reverse transcription process, of
which the specialized RT recognizes the unique secondary
structure of retron ncRNA, is highly speci ﬁc (Hsu et al.,
1989). Additionally, desired msDNA can be generated in vivo
by replacing the dispensable region of retron ncRNA with
desired sequences (Mirochnitchenko et al., 1994; Simon
et al., 2019). Therefore, retrons are promising biological
sources for in vivo generation of DNA donors for HDR-me-
diated precise genome editing.
Recently, several studies have shown that retrons cou-
pled with CRISPR-Cas9 could enhance precise genome
editing via HDR in bacterium and yeast through fusing guide
RNA (gRNA) to the 3 ′ end of retron ncRNA, producing
multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) covalently tethered
to gRNA (Sharon et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2020; Schubert
et al., 2021). In this study, we further engineered retrons by
fusing Cas9 with E. coli RT from different clades and joining
gRNA at the 5 ′ end of retron ncRNA, and found that retron
editing can achieve precise genome editing ef ﬁciently in
human cells. By co-expression of Cas9-RT fusions and ret-
ron-ncRNA gRNA (rgRNA) in HEK293T cells, we demon-
strated the rate of retron editing-mediated HDR events at
endogenous genomic loci was up to 10%. We expect our
retron editing system could aid in advancing the ex vivo and
in vivo therapeutic applications of retrons.
Given that HDR-mediated precise editing can be
enhanced by increasing the local abundance of donor DNA,
and CRISPEY strategy showed highly ef ﬁcient editing in
yeast genome by in situ expressing retron-gRNA chimeric
molecule (Sharon et al., 2018). Therefore, we attempted to
in situ reverse transcribe the donor msDNA covalently teth-
ered to gRNA by fusing retron ncRNA at the 5 ′ or 3 ′ end of
gRNA, termed as the retron-ncRNA gRNA (rgRNA) (Fig.
1A
and 1B). Four experimentally validated E. coli retrons were
evaluated for in vivo production of msDNA in human cells
(Figs. 1B and S1). Additionally, we fused retron RT to the
amino terminus or carboxy terminus of Cas9 with XTEN
linker to increase the spatial proximity between RT and
Cas9, which may enhance the retron editing in human cells
by increasing the abundance of donor msDNA in the vicinity
of DSB stimulated by Cas9 (Fig. 1B).
We ﬁrst sought to test the relative abundance of msDNA
in human cells. We found all of four selected RTs enabled the
expression of msDNA in human cells, and retron RT com-
bining with 3 ′ rgRNA showed higher expression of msDNA
comparing to that with 5 ′ rgRNA (Fig. 1C). The results indi-
cated that retron RT were reverse transcription-functional in
human cells, inspiring us to further study the potential of
retron editing at human endogenous genomic loci.
Next, we investigated the potential of retron editing in
human HEK293T cells (Figs. 2 and S2). We transfected the
HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing different Cas9-RT
fusions targeting EMX1 locus and HEK3 site (Anzalone
et al., 2019), and plasmids expressing 5 ′ rgRNA or 3 ′ rgRNA
that can produce msDNA with 120 nucleotide (nt)-long
homology donor sequences as well (Fig. 2A and 2B). To
determine the retron editing-mediated HDR ef ﬁciency at
EMX1 and HEK3, we performed deep sequencing. Among
four retrons tested, Ec86, Ec73 and Ec107 achieved varying
degrees of precise editing and Ec73 combining with
CRISPR-Cas9 showed highest activity, up to 10% (Fig. 2C).
Restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), con-
ﬁrmed the deep sequencing results (Fig. S2A). In addition,
retron editing with shortened homology donor sequences (90
nt) also enabled precise editing, including insertions and
transversions (Fig. S2B). To test that retron editing is RT

activity-dependent, point mutations of D189A and D190A
were introduced to the predicted active site of the Ec73
(Figs. 2D and S3), generating a catalytically dead Ec73
(dEc73). As expected, compared with Cas9 fused with wild-
type Ec73, Cas9 fused with dEc73 or Cas9 only dramatically
reduced the retron editing-mediated HDR ef ﬁciency
(Fig. 2D). Together, our results indicated that Cas9-Ec73 RT
fusion combining with 3 ′ Ec73 rgRNA can be harnessed for
efﬁcient precise genome editing in human cells (Fig. 2E). Of
note, besides HDR events, we detected relatively high fre-
quency of indels simulated by retron editing system (Figs. S2
and S4), suggesting Cas9-RT fusions co-expressing with
relevant rgRNA retained the double stranded DNA cleavage
activity of Cas9.
In addition, four of reported CRISPR-Cas9 off-target sites
relative to EMX1 locus were checked to determine the off-
targeting effects of retron editing (Fig. S5). Although, Cas9-
Ec73RT with rgRNA induced similar rate of indels at on-
target sites as Cas9 with sgRNA (Fig. S5B), Cas9-Ec73RT
with rgRNA showed reduced activity at the four known off-
target sites, with 4.9-fold lower average frequency than that
of Cas9 with sgRNA. To be noted, the off-targeting effects of
msDNA should be checked before further application of
retron editing, although the frequency of random insertion of
ssDNA is much lower than that of dsDNA.
The ability to write any modi ﬁcation of interest into the
genome is a long-sought goal of biotechnology. Retrons,
capable of producing intracellular ssDNA as donor with high
speciﬁcity, are promising biological sources for precise
genome editing. In this study, we demonstrate that different
retrons are functional in human cells. Moreover, by co-ex-
pressing Cas9-RT fusions and 3 ′ extended retron-ncRNA
gRNA, retron editing could mediate precise genome editing
in human cell. Compared with ssDNA-mediated HDR in
293T cells, no exogenous ssDNA donor is required in retron
editing system.

retron ncRNA form secondary structure which can be speci ﬁcally recognized by relevant retron RT reverse transcribing part of msd
region, generating multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). After reverse trancription, the msd template is degraded by RNase H.

rgRNA, is driven by the EF1 α promoter. Four E. coli retrons (Ec48 RT, Ec73 RT, Ec86 RT and Ec107 RT) from different clades were
used in our retron editing system. The replaceable region of retron ncRNA was replaced by a 122 nt modi ﬁed HEK3 sequencce.

Additionally, retrons coupled with CRISPR can ef ﬁciently
insert a GFP gene in yeast with ef ﬁciency up to 87% (Sharon
et al., 2018), making us anticipating retron editing a more
versatile genome editor in both therapeutic applications and
crop improvement. Precise genome editing on locus corre-
sponding to agronomic traits can greatly accelerate the crop
breeding (Mao et al., 2019; Gao, 2021). Although, base
transversions, small insertion and deletion by base editors
and prime editors have been successfully achieved in plant
cells (Gao, 2021). However, HDR-mediated large fragment
insertions cannot be ef ﬁciently achieved due to the low HDR
efﬁciency and limit of exogenous donor DNA delivery in plant
cells (Gao, 2021). Therefore, it is interesting to test the
possibility of using retron editing for large fragment insertion
in plant cells.
Many approaches may be done to improve retron editing
in human cells. Firstly, identi ﬁcation of more suitable retron
for genome editing in human cells. Second, engineered
evolution of both retron-RTand retron-ncRNA can be done to
enhance retron mediated intracellular production of ssDNA.
Finally, evidences were shown that hRAD51 mutant fused to
Cas9 (D10A) nickase (RDN) fusions could mediate precise
genome editing without DSBs (Rees et al., 2019). It is
plausible to anticipate that combination of retrons with RDN
may make retron editing more accurate and safer due to the
elimination of Cas9-induced DSBs.
