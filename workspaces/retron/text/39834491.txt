Introduction: Hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
(hv-CRKP) poses an increasing public health risk due to its high treatment
difﬁculty and associated mortality, especially in bone marrow transplant (BMT)
patients. The emergence of strains with multiple resistance mechanisms
further complicates the management of these infections.
Methods: We isolated and characterized a novel ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain from
a pediatric bone marrow transplantation patient. Antimicrobial susceptibility
testing was performed to determine resistance patterns. Comprehensive
genomic analysis was conducted to identify plasmid types, virulence factors,
and antimicrobial resistance genes, as well as potential resistance mechanisms
associated with mutations and plasmid-mediated variants.
Results: The isolated hv-CRKP strain exhibited multidrug resistance to
carbapenem, tigecycline, and polymyxin. Genomic analysis revealed that the
IncHI1B/repB plasmid carried virulence factors (rmpA, ΔrmpA2, iucABCD, iutA),
while IncFII/IncR and IncFII plasmids harbored resistance genes [bla
CTX-M-65,
blaTEM-1B, rmtB, blaSHV-12, blaKPC-2, qnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet(A), tet(R)].
The coexistence of blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-12, blaLAP-2, and blaKPC-2 in
one hv-CRKP strain is exceptionally rare. Additionally, the Tet(A)-S251A variant
in the conjugative plasmid pTET-4 may confer tigecycline resistance.
Mutations in MgrB, PhoPQ, and PmrABCDK were identi ﬁed as potential
contributors to increased polymyxin resistance. Interestingly, plasmid-encoded
restriction-modiﬁcation systems and Retron regions were identi ﬁed, which
could potentially confer phage resistance.
Discussion: The combination of virulence and antimicrobial resistance factors in
the ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain represents a signiﬁcant challenge for treating
immunocompromised pediatric patients. Particularly concerning is the
resistance to polymyxin and tigecycline, which are often last-resort treatments
for multidrug-resistant infections. The ﬁndings highlight the urgent need for
effective surveillance, infection control measures, and novel therapeutic
strategies to manage such hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Introduction
The prevalence of carbapenem-resistantK. pneumonia (CRKP)
infection poses a signiﬁcant and enduring obstacle to worldwide
public health systems (1– 3). The emergence of hypervirulent CRKP
(hv-CRKP) strains has added another layer of complexity, as they
combine high virulence with multidrug resistance, severely limiting
treatment options and increasing mortality rates ( 4). ST11, a
dominant CRKP clone in China, has emerged as a high-risk lineage
due to its ability to acquire virulence plasmids (5). Zhou et al.
reported that ST11-KL64 CRKP has gradually replaced ST11-KL47
and become the most prevalent and highly virulent CRKP clone
in China since 2016 (6). This lineage poses a signiﬁcant public
health threat, particularly amongimmunocompromised individuals,
due to its enhanced transmissibility, multidrug resistance, and
hypervirulence (7). The propagation of CRKP among individuals
with hematological malignancies presents a particularly worrisome
challenge ( 8– 11). Favorable conditions for the spread of
CRKP infection include potent ial blood disorders, intensi ﬁed
chemotherapy, neutropenia, gastrointestinal mucositis, and prolonged
hospitalization, all of which heighten the risk of bacteremia (8– 10).
The mortality rate associated with CRKP bacteremia in individuals
with neutropenic hepatopathy has been reported to be approximately
60%, with a continued high prevalence expected, particularly among
recipients of BMT (12, 13). Infections caused by ST11 hv-CRKP
strains are further exacerbated by their rapid evolution of resistance
under antibiotic pressure, with mechanisms involving ramR, mgrB,
and pmrB mutations contributing to resistance to last-resort
antibiotics like polymyxin and tigecycline (14). In addition, the
emergence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) has been
observed at a higher rate (55.3%) in immunocompromised patients
(11). However, there remains a paucity of research examining the
impact of hv-CRKP on this high-risk population.
Currently, the therapeutic op tions available for hv-CRKP
infection remain limited. Polymyxin and tigecycline are regarded as
last-resort antibiotics in the management of CRKP-related infections
(4, 15, 16). Regrettably, bacteria can develop resistance to polymyxin
and tigecycline through alterations in mgrB, mutations in the two-
component regulatory system (pmrABCDK and phoPQ), or
disruption of regulatory genes that encode efﬂux pumps (e.g., ramR,
ramA, and rarA) (17, 18). These resistance mechanisms further
complicate the management of hv-CRKP infections and highlight
the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies.
Despite increasing attention to hv-CRKP infections, particularly
in immunocompromised populations, there remains limited
understanding of the genetic determinants underlying hypervirulence
and multidrug resistance, especially in strains like ST11-KL64.
Moreover, the concurrent presence of multiple resistance genes (e.g.,
bla
CTX-M-65,b l aKPC-2) and virulence factors (e.g.,rmpA, iucABCD)i n
a single hv-CRKP strain raises questions about their roles in clinical
outcomes and therapeutic challenges. In addition, transmission of
hv-CRKP is closely linked to its presence in the gut, which makes it
more widespread in community and healthcare Settings (19). To
address these gaps, our study aims to comprehensively characterize
the genomic features of the ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain CZC, with a
focus on the mechanisms driving its hypervirulence and resistance to
critical antibiotics. By elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to
provide insights that could inform effective strategies for managing
hv-CRKP infections in high-risk populations.
Materials and methods
Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study was reviewed and approved by the Aerospace Center
Hospital (No. JHYLS-2022– 122). Verbal informed consent was
obtained from the subject in this study. This study informed
verbal consent was obtained from participant.
Medical history of infection
An 18-year-old male patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation due to primary immunodeﬁciency disease.
Soon afterwards, the patient was diagnosed with a bloodstream
infection, and a CRKP isolate (named CZC) was isolated from
the blood sample. Combination antibiotic treatment was used
immediately, including meropenem, polymyxin, ceftazidime
avibactam, vancomycin, and tigecycline. Unfortunately, the patient
died from this infection.
Isolation and identiﬁcation of bacteria
K. pneumoniae CZC was isolated from the blood samples of
this patient. Blood culture was done using a BACT/ALERT® 3D
blood culture system(bioMérieux, France). Bacteria was
conﬁrmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-
of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry(MS) (Vitek MS,
bioMerieux, France). In addition, molecular genotyping
(serotyping and multilocus sequence typing) and phenotype
validation (antibiotic susceptibility assay and Galleria mellonella
infection model) were examined.
Phenotypic characterization
We employed the disk diffusion method in our testing.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using GN335
cards from the Vitek 2 Compact system (bioMérieux, France), with
broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods used to validate the
results for certain antibiotics (20) Colistin was tested using the broth
microdilution method, while meropenem, imipenem, and tigecycline
were tested using the disk diffusion method and the results were
interpreted according to the CLSI standards. The virulence
phenotype was evaluated by theG. mellonellalarvae infection model.
NTUH-K2044 served as a hypervirulent control strain, while 13,190,
veriﬁed by whole-genome sequencing to lack virulence genes, was
used as a low-virulence control strain (21, 22). All experiments were
performed with three replications. The statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Genomic DNA sequencing, assembly,
correction, and annotation
Whole-genome sequencing was performed using the
PromethION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc., UK).
This strain was resequenced using Illumina NovoSeq 6,000
sequencing platform (Illumina, CA, USA) to prevent or correct
errors. The complete genome was generated by Unicycler v0.4.4
(23) and annotated using RAST (24) .I n f o r m a t i o no nt h eC Z C
strain has been submitted to the NCBI database with the project
accession number PRJNA865496. The biosample number is
SAMN30114398 and the accession numbers CP102390– CP102396.
Bioinformatics analysis
The circular genome maps were drawn with Proksee
(https://proksee.ca). The virulence genes were identiﬁed using the
Pasteur Institute and VFanalyzer databases. The resistance genes
were identiﬁed using ResFinder. The SNP-based phylogenetic
tree was constructed using the Pathogenwatch phylogenetic tool
(https://pathogen.watch), and the isolates were compared to twenty-
nine strains of ST11-KL64K. pneumoniaeisolates and the genomes
of the CZC strain, which is available in the Pathogenwatch database.
The 1972 core genes library of K. pneumoniae were used in
Pathogenwatch to generate pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) distances between genomes, which are used to construct
neighbor-joining trees (25). The information on resistance genes and
isolated countries was derived from annotation information in
Pathogenwatch. iToL was used for phylogenetic tree improvement
(26). The incompatible plasmid groups were identi ﬁed using
PlasmidFinder. The type of plasmid was determined by comparison
to the nucleotide database using BLAST.
Results
Patient history
The patient was diagnosed with splenomegaly at the age of 6,
accompanied by recurrent fever and lymphadenopathy, which
gradually progressed to pancytopenia. Genetic testing identiﬁed a
mutation in the XIAP gene, conﬁrming a diagnosis of X-linked
lymphoproliferative disease. At 18 years old, the patient developed
hemophagocytic syndrome, which showed poor response to
chemotherapy. As a result, an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation was performed, with the donor being a fully
matched (10/10) unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor. Two
months post-transplant, the patient experienced sudden chills and
rigor, with a temperature spike to 39°C. Blood pressure dropped to
80/50 mmHg, urine output became scant, and the heart rate
increased to 130 beats per minute. Laboratory tests revealed IL-6
levels exceeding 4,000 ng/ml, PCT levels peaking at 59 ng/ml, and
CRP levels above 150 ng/ml. Blood cultures conﬁrmed the presence
of K. pneumoniae. A chest x-ray performed the following day
showed extensive pulmonary inﬁltrates in both lungs, accompanied
by respiratory distress and type I respiratory failure. By the fourth
day, the patient succumbed to multi-organ dysfunction, with sepsis
and pulmonary ARDS identiﬁed as the primary causes of death.
Resistance and virulence phenotypes of
K. pneumoniae strains
K. pneumoniae CZC showed resistance to a total of seventeen
antibiotics in eleven categories. In particular, it was resistant to
tigecycline, polymyxin, meropenem, imipenem and amikacin
(Table 1). In addition, we performed testing using the disk diffusion
method and broth microdilution method. The MIC value for
colistin was ≥4.0 mg/L, for meropenem was ≥16.0 µg/ml, for
imipenem was≥16.0 µg/ml, and for tigecycline was≥4 µg/ml, with
an inhibition zone diameter of less than 14 mm. Additionally, for
CZA tested by disk diffusion, the inhibition zone diameter was
22 mm, which is considered intermediate (I), indicating that the
strain’s resistance to CZA falls between susceptible and resistant. In
addition, we used two control strains (hvKP strain NTUH-K2044
and CRKP strain 13,190) andK. pneumoniae CZC for virulence
phenotype experiments. The G. mellonella larvae infected with
K. pneumoniae CZC and NTUH-K2044 had signiﬁcantly lower
survival than those infected with CR-KP 13,190 (Figure 1). These
results suggest thatK. pneumoniaeCZC is a hypervirulent strain.

chromosome with 5,349,784 bp and six plasmids (pVir-1,
pKPC-ESBL-2, pRM-3, pTET-4, pColRNAI-5, and p6) (Table 2).
According to the MLST and capsule type results,K. pneumoniae
CZC belongs to the ST11/CG258 and KL64 capsule types.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ST11-KL64 strains have
developed a greater population clone ( Figure 2). Most of the
ST11-KL64 strains have drug resistance combinations blaKPC-2,
blaTEM-1B, and blaSHV-11 (Figure 2). The CZC strain coexisted
with blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-12, blaLAP-2 and blaKPC-2,
which was very rare in ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strains.

tetracycline [tet(A), tet(R)], trimethoprim (dfrA14), sulfonamides
(sul2), aminoglycosides (rmtB), efﬂux pumps (CRP, lptD, kpnEFG)
and pmr phosphoethanolamine transferase (eptB, arnT)( Table 3).
Meanwhile, pKPC-ESBL-2 (135,425 bp, IncFII/IncR) carried
blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, rmtB, blaSHV-12,a n d blaKPC-2. pTET-4
(84,876 bp, IncFII) carriedqnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet(A), and
tet(R) (Supplementary Figure S2).
Based on the analysis of virulence genes, the CZC strain has
108 virulence genes, including capsular polysaccharide ( rmpA
and ΔrmpA2), type Iﬁmbriae system (ﬁmABCDEFGHIK), type 3
ﬁmbriae system (mrkABCDF), aerobactin (iucABCD, iutA, and
ΔiroN) and yersiniabactin (fyuA, irp1, irp2, and ybtAEPQSTUX).
These virulence genes are recognized virulence factors and play
important virulence roles. Meanwhile, pVir-1 (193,821 bp,
IncHI1B/FIB), with rmpA, ΔrmpA2, iucABCD, iutA, and ΔiroN,
is highly homologous to the virulence plasmid pLVPK (89%
coverage, 99.43% identity) ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The
IncFIB/IncHI1B type virulence plasmid could be transferred via
conjugation to Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae strains,
leading to a sharp increase in the prevalence of hv-CRKP in
clinical settings, which poses a great threat to human health (27).
Comparative analysis of MDR-resistant
regions
The MDR regions of K. pneumoniae CZC were mainly
distributed on pKPC-ESBL-2 (IncFII/IncR) and pTET-4 (IncFII).
pKPC-ESBL-2 was divided into two parts ( Figure 3 ,
Supplementary Figure S4 ). One part is the ESBL region
containing blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, rmtB, and blaSHV-12. The IS1R-
IS26 element in the ends of the entire MDR region can mediate
homologous recombination in the corresponding region
(Figure 3A). The other part is the KPC-2 region, a truncated
Tn6296 ﬂanked by an IS26 insertion that can mediate the
transfer of theblaKPC-2-resistant region (Figure 3B).

The MDR region on pTET-4 showed a high similarity to
pKp_Goe_414-4 (CP018341.1, 95% coverage), containing the
resistance genes qnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet(A), and tet(R)
(Supplementary Figure S4).
Point mutations are responsible for
resistance to tigecycline and polymyxin
The consistency between the clinical and drug susceptibility
results of the CZC strain supports insensitivity to polymyxin and
tigecycline (Table 1). Genetic analysis revealed that tigecycline
resistance was associated with the tet(A) gene, with the Tet(A)-
S251A mutation identiﬁed on the conjugal plasmid pTET-4. This
mutation correlated with increased MICs for tigecycline,
tetracycline, and minocycline. Polymyxin resistance was linked to
mgrB-M1V, phoQ-D150G, pmrB-R256G, pmrC-Q319R, pmrD-
D80G, and pmrK-Q156H R157S mutations within the MgrB,
PhoPQ, and PmrABCDK systems ( Table 4). Additionally, the
protein KpnEF in the CZC strain may play a role in capsule
synthesis and resistance to polymyxin. The presence of a type
I R-M system in pRM-3 and a predicted Retron region in
pColRNAI-5 suggests potential antiphage defense mechanisms in
the strain.

Discussion
ST11 is a common clone group of CRKP in China, and it is also
a high-risk clone group with the ability to obtain highly virulent
plasmids (6). Zhou et al. reported that ST11-KL64 CRKP had
gradually replaced ST11-KL47 and became the most prevalent
and highly virulent CRKP clone in China since 2016 (28). In our
study, a novel ST11-KL64 CZC strain wasﬁrst isolated from the
blood of pediatric BMT patient and was identiﬁed to have a high
virulence and multidrug-resistant phenotype. The genome
analysis indicates that hypervirulent K. pneumoniae with
tigecycline, polymyxin and carbapenem resistance might result in
ﬁnal antibiotic treatment failure. The spread of these strains
poses an enormous threat to public health.
The hypervirulent phenotype of CZC is mainly provided by the
pLVPK-like virulence plasmid carrying the virulence genesrmpA,
ΔrmpA2, iucABCD, and iutA. They play an important role in
inhibiting phagocytosis of host cells, immune evasion, increasing
bactericidal activity, and anti-phagocytosis (29), which increase
hvKP strain survival in the host and spread from the bloodstream.
In terms of drug resistance, CZC shows resistance to
tigecycline, polymyxin, meropenem, and imipenem ( Table 1).
The CRKP resistance gene blaKPC-2 is located on the MDR
plasmid pKPC-ESBL-2. It has an IncFII (pHN7A8)/IncR
backbone containing two MDR regions (ESBLs and KPC-2),
which is different from the structure of pHN7A8. The ESBL
resistance region contain an IS26- blaSHV-12-IS26 unit and the
blaKPC-2 resistant unit. In China, blaKPC-2 is most commonly
found in an environment with an IS26-Tn6296 compound
transposon ( 30). The type of IncFII/IncR plasmid plays
an important role in the spread of CRKP, carrying various
resistance genes effectively (31). The IncFII/IncR-type blaKPC-2-
bearing plasmid could be transferred via conjugation to
Enterobacteriaceae strains alone as well as together with the
IncFIB/IncHI1B-type virulence plasmid (32). Another resistance
plasmid, pTET-4, has an IncFIIpKp_Goe_414-4-type backbone
with qnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet (A), and tet(R).They were
located in an MDR region ( ΔTn6591-ΔTn1721 region and
truncated IS26– blaLAP-2– qnrS1– IS26 unit). The results showed
that IS26 as well as transposons and integrons are essential for
increasing multidrug resistance inK. pneumoniae.
Our analysis identiﬁed the Tet(A)-S251A mutation on the
conjugal plasmid pTET-4, which has been previously shown to
confer high-level tigecycline resistance in CRKP strains and E.
coli ATCC 25,922, alongside increased MICs for tetracycline and
minocycline (32, 33). Furthermore, the synergy between the tet
(A) variant and the RND-type efﬂux transporters contributes to
tigecycline resistance in A. baumannii (34), and this may also
work in K. pneumoniae . Furthermore, sporadically reported
mutations of genes ( pmrBCDK, phoQ, and mgrB) even
simultaneously occurred to acquire polymyxin resistance in our
CZC isolate. These include mgrB-M1V, phoQ-D150G,
pmrB-R256G, pmrC-Q319R, pmrD-D80G, and pmrK-Q156H
R157S mutations within the MgrB, PhoPQ, and PmrABCDK
systems, consistent with their known roles in elevating
polymyxin MICs ( 21). Additionally, the KpnEF protein may
contribute to capsule synthesis regulation and resistance
mechanisms, as reported inE. coli (35).
With the complication of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent
need for adequate antimicrobial agents to treat hv-CRKP
infections. Tigecycline is regarded as a last resort treatment for
CRKP infections and is widely used in clinical practice (36, 37).
Therefore, the emergence of tigecycline and polymyxin resistance
in hv-CRKP infection makes clinical treatment difﬁcult (4) due
to amino acid mutations in common targets. In addition to
mutations in resistance genes, the presence of an antibiotic efﬂux
pump in this strain may also have implications for its increased
antimicrobial drug resistance (33). The involvement of Tet(A)-
S251A and MgrB-M1V, and the synergy of the RND-type efﬂux
transporters in the mechanisms of tigecycline resistance are
worthy of further study. In addition, the Tet (A) S251A variant
is located in the conjugative plasmid pTET-4, which provides a
genetic basis for cotransfer with plasmids.
Furthermore, a type I R-M system and a predicted Retron
region contained in the plasmid of CZC provide antiphage
defense to the strain ( 38). In conclusion, the ST11-KL64 hv-
CRKP CZC strain showed worrying results regarding antibiotic
resistance and virulence. Our results suggest the potential of this
strain to become a novel signiﬁcant superbug and a threat to
public health. In particular, it presents a deadly threat to
immunocompromised patients.
Our study builds on existing knowledge of ST11-KL64 CRKP
strains, which have been widely recognized as high-risk clones
with signiﬁcant virulence and resistance potential (28). Previous
works have documented the gradual replacement of ST11-KL47
by ST11-KL64 as the dominant CRKP clone in China, driven by
its enhanced virulence and transmissibility (
28). Similarly, the
hypervirulent phenotype in hv-CRKP has been previously
attributed to pLVPK-like plasmids carrying virulence genes like
rmpA and iucABCD (31). However, our study provides unique
insights by identifying a novel ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain
(CZC) from a pediatric BMT patient. Unlike previous reports, we
demonstrated the coexistence of hypervirulence and resistance to
carbapenems, tigecycline, and polymyxin within this strain.
Speciﬁcally, we uncovered the genetic mechanisms of tigecycline
resistance through the Tet(A)-S251A mutation and its synergy

with RND-type efﬂux transporters, a phenomenon rarely studied in
K. pneumoniae (35). Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of mgrB and
phoQ mutations in polymyxin resistance aligns with previous
ﬁndings (21) but also expands the understanding by highlighting
their co-occurrence with additional resistance determinants
within the CZC strain.
Conclusions
Based on a drug-susceptibility assay and aG. mellonellalarvae
infection model, we ﬁrst con ﬁrmed the coexistence of
hypervirulence and polymyxin, tigecycline, and carbapenem
resistance in the ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP CZC strain. Further, we
conﬁrmed the genetic basis of these phenotypes through
complete genome sequencing. Notably, resistance to polymyxin
and tigecycline is a fatal threat to immunocompromised pediatric
patients, especially those with BMT.
