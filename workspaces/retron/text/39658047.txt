Abstract 
The bacterial retron reverse transcriptase system has served as an intracellular f actory f or single-stranded DNA in many biotechnological appli- 
cations. In these technologies, a natural retron non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is modified to encode a template for the production of custom DNA 
sequences b y re v erse transcription. T he efficiency of re v erse transcription is a major limiting step for retron technologies, but we lack system- 
atic knowledge of how to improve or maintain reverse transcription efficiency while changing the retron sequence for custom DNA production. 
Here, we test thousands of different modifications to the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA and measure DNA production in pooled variant library experi- 
ments, identifying regions of the ncRNA that are tolerant and intolerant to modification. We apply this new information to a specific application: 
the use of the retron to produce a precise genome editing donor in combination with a CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (an editron). We use 
high-throughput libraries in Saccharom y ces cere visiae to additionally define design rules for editrons. We extend our new knowledge of retron 
DNA production and editron design rules to human genome editing to achie v e the highest efficiency Retron-Eco1 editrons to date.

Introduction 
Retron components are increasingly being exploited for 
biotechnology due to their ability to produce DNA on de- 
mand in cells. In bacteria, retrons are a tripartite anti-phage 
system composed of a reverse transcriptase (RT), a non-coding 
RNA (ncRNA) that is reverse transcribed into DNA (multi- 
copy single-stranded DNA; msDNA) and an effector protein 
( 1 ,2 ). For Retron-Eco1 (used in this study), correct msDNA 
synthesis, initiated at a conserved guanosine via a 2 ′ –5 ′ link- 
age, is crucial for phage defense ( 3 ,4 ) and results in filamen- 
tous sequestration of the toxic effector protein ( 5 ). A phage- 
encoded DNA cytosine methyltransferase triggers abortive in- 
fection by methylating the Retron-Eco1 reverse-transcribed 
DNA and results in nucleoside derivative depletion ( 6 ). The 
editron system uses only the RT and ncRNA from the retron 
as the effector protein is not necessary for reverse transcrip- 
tion. 
In biotechnology, the retron RT is used to reverse transcribe 
modified forms of retron ncRNA into reverse-transcribed 
DNA (RT-DNA), or msDNA that has been used as: donor 
DNA for precise editing in bacteria ( 7–12 ), bacteriophage 
( 13–15 ), plants ( 16 ,17 ) and eukaryotes ( 12 ,18–22 ); DNA bar- 
codes to record molecular events ( 23 ,24 ); DNA containing 
transcription factor motifs for transcription factor activity

messenger RNA cleavage ( 27 ). 
Previous work has demonstrated that the abundance of 
retron reverse-transcribed DNA directly impacts the effi- 
ciency of downstream biotechnological applications. Specif- 
ically, modifications to the retron that generate more msDNA 
increase the efficiency of precise editing and the efficiency of 
event recording into a molecular ledger ( 19 , 23 , 25 ). These pre- 
vious works used the same modification to the retron ncRNA 
for increased msDNA production—extension of the a1 / a2 
region. However, the retron ncRNA has not been systemat- 
ically interrogated to determine which elements are necessary, 
which are tolerant to modifications, and where it may be pos- 
sible to increase reverse transcription beyond the endogenous 
element. 
In the context of precise genome editing technologies, there 
are additional parameters that have not been investigated 
systematically. An editron, which combines retron compo- 
nents with CRISPR-Cas9 components to generate both a pro- 
grammed double-strand break and the reverse-transcribed 
donor to precisely repair it, has many degrees of freedom. 
These include among others, how to arrange the donor and 
guide RNA (gRNA) relative to each other, where to situate the 
edit within the donor, or how long of a donor to use. Without 
a set of clear design rules, users are left to either empirically 
test many designs for their desired edit or pick an arbitrary 
design which may not perform optimally. 
To rectify this lack of systematic investigation, we compre- 
hensively tested all parameters of the retron ncRNA for their 
effect on msDNA production in high throughput, used these 
findings to build a machine learning model of msDNA pro- 
duction, and used the output of the model to inform high- 
throughput tests of editing parameters in yeast. Finally, we 
extended these findings to human cells, resulting in a set of 
design rules for msDNA production and retron-based editing 
that apply broadly. 
Materials and methods 
Biological replicates were taken from distinct samples, not the 
same sample measured repeatedly. For Esc heric hia coli variant 
libraries, each biological replicate is an independent electropo- 
ration and expression of the libraries into the strain bSLS.114. 
For Saccharomyces cerevisiae variant libraries, each biolog- 
ical replicate is an independent transformation and expres- 
sion of the variant libraries using a scaled-up version of the 
Zymo Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit into the respec- 
tive yeast strains containing the editing site. For human valida- 
tion, each biological replicate is an independent transfection 
and expression of variants using Lipofectamine 3000 into a 
Cas9-containing HEK293T cell line. 
All statistical tests and P -values are included in 
Supplementary Table S1 . 
Constructs and strains 
A derivative of BL21-AI cells was used for all E. coli vari- 
ant library experiments. This derivative, bSLS.114, has the 
endogenous Retron-Eco1 operon replaced by a chlorampheni- 
col resistance cassette flanked by FRT recombinase sites using 
the method developed by Datsenko and Wanner ( 28 ). This 
knock-out cassette was amplified from pKD3, adding homol- 
ogy arms to the Retron-Eco1 locus with polymerase chain re- 
action (PCR) primers, and electroporated into BL21-AI cells 
with the Lambda Red recombination machinery (pKD46). Af- 
ter selecting clones on 10 μg / ml chloramphenicol plates, we 
genotyped to confirm the locus-specific knock-out and then 
excised the chloramphenicol resistance cassette using the FLP 
recombinase (pMS127). 
All yeast variant libraries were cloned into pKDC.100, 
which contains, under control of a Gal7 promoter, the 5 ′ end 
of the msr / msd and PaqCI Golden Gate restriction enzyme 
sites at the 3 ′ end of the msd for insertion of variant parts. This 
plasmid contains a URA3 selection marker and an episomal 
origin of replication (CEN / ARS), and was constructed using 
Gibson assembly, with a Twist-synthesized gBlock containing 
the PaqCI sites and a PCR-amplified linear pSCL039 19 . Yeast 
plasmids containing the three editing sites in the HIS3 site 
were based off pZS.157 18 . These three variants (pSCL194: site 
1; pSCL195: site 2; and pSCL368: site 3) contain galactose- 
inducible Retron-Eco1 RT and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 
(Gal1-10 promoter) along with their respective sites. These 
plasmids were all constructed using Gibson assembly, us- 
ing pZS.157 to create the backbone and Twist-synthesize 
gBlocks containing the editing sites. The strains containing 
these editing sites along with Cas9 and Retron-Eco1 RT were 
made using LiAc / SS carrier DNA / PEG transformation ( 29 ) of 
BY4742 ( 30 ). The respective plasmids were linearized using 
KpnI and transformed into BY4742 for homologous recom- 
bination into the HIS3 locus. Clones were selected on SD-HIS 
media. 
All human vectors are derivatives of pSCL.273 12 , itself a 
derivative of pC AGGS. pC AGGS was modified by replacing 
the MCS and rb_glob_polyA sequence with an IDT gblock 
containing inverted BbsI restriction sites and a SpCas9 trans- 
activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), using Gibson Assem- 
bly. The resulting plasmid, pSCL.273, contains an SV40 ori 
for plasmid maintenance in HEK293T cells. The strong CAG 
promoter is followed by the BbsI sites and SpCas9 tracr- 
RNA. BbsI-mediated digestion of pSCL.273 yields a back- 
bone for single or library cloning of plasmids by Gibson As- 
sembly or Golden Gate cloning. Our backbone incorporated 
an EGFP-P2A and Eco1RT into pSCL.273. Twist-synthesized 
gBlocks encoding our various ncRNA donors were cloned 
into this backbone (pKDC.154) via Golden Gate Reaction 
with PaqCI. Plasmids were subsequently midiprepped accord- 
ing to manufacturer instruction (QIAGEN 12143). Human 
experiments were carried out in a HEK293T cell line which 
expresses Cas9 from a Piggybac-integrated, TRE3G-driven, 
doxycycline-inducible (1 μg / ml) cassette, which we have pre- 
viously described ( 19 ). 
All strains / lines are listed in Supplementary Table S3 , and 
all plasmids in Supplementary Table S2 . 
Variant library cloning 
Esc heric hia coli variant cloning was done as previously de- 
scribed ( 19 ) using BsaI Type IIS restriction sites and Golden 
Gate cloning. After high-efficiency cloning and electropora- 
tion, variant libraries were miniprepped for electroporation 
into the experimental strain (bSLS.114, described above). All 
E. coli variant parts were synthesized by Agilent. 
All S. cerevisiae variant parts were synthesized by Twist. 
The variant part of the editron ncRNA was flanked by PaqCI 
Type IIS restriction sites and specific primers to amplify out 
sublibraries from a larger synthesis run. Each variant part 
Nucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 3 
was padded by random nucleotides to 250 bp on the 3 ′ 
end, and sublibraries were segregated by original variant part 
length (gated to each sublibrary having < 10% variance in 
the length) to avoid library bias with amplifying out subli- 
braries by PCR. Variant sublibraries were then combined with 
pKDC.100 in a Golden Gate reaction using PaqCI and the 
PaqCI activator (2:1 ratio), and T4 DNA ligase (NEB) to gen- 
erate cloned sublibraries at high efficiency after electropora- 
tion into a cloning strain (ECloni Elite 10G, Biosearch Tech- 
nologies). Sublibraries were then midiprepped and combined 
based on the number of variant parts in the sublibrary and the 
DNA concentration to create a final pooled library with equal 
distribution of variant parts (QIAGEN). 
Variant library expression and sequencing 
Esc heric hia coli variant libraries were grown overnight and 
diluted 1:500 into expression media (arabinose and isopropyl 
beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, or IPTG, for the ncRNA, and 
erythromycin for the RT). At dilution, we also took a pre- 
expression sample. We then grew the cells for 5 h shak- 
ing at 37 ◦C. After expression, we took two samples: one 
for variant plasmid quantification and the other for msDNA 
quantification. 
The pre-expression and post-expression plasmid sam- 
ples were mixed 1:1 with water and boiled at 95 ◦C 
for 5 min, then plasmid variants were amplified using 
PCR primers Eco1_Variant_Plasmids_for_Sequencing_F and 
Eco1_Variant_Plasmids_for_Sequencing_R. msd variant plas- 
mids were identified by their altered sequence without bar- 
codes, while msr variant plasmids were identified by the 
matched barcode in the msd on the plasmid amplicon. 
The msDNA expression sample was prepared as pre- 
viously described ( 19 ). Briefly, DNA was purified us- 
ing a modified miniprep protocol, treated with RNase 
A / T1 (New England Biolabs), and purified with single- 
stranded DNA (ssDNA) / RNA Clean & Concentrator 
kit from Zymo Research. After ssDNA isolation, we 
either amplified the DNA barcode with primers con- 
taining Illumina adapters ( msr sublibraries msDNA 
samples; primers: Eco1_msdloop_for_Sequencing_F and 
Eco1_msdloop_for_Sequencing_R) or performed a non- 
sequence-biased sequencing preparation ( msd msDNA 
sublibraries). To amplify msDNA without prior knowledge 
of the sequence, we treated the sample with DBR1 (Origene), 
extended the 3 ′ end with dCTP with TdT. We used Klenow 
fragment (3 ′ → 5 ′ exo-) to create the second complementary 
strand using a primer with six guanines and an Illumina 
adapter. After creating the second strand, we ligated an 
Illumina adapter to the 3 ′ end of the complementary strand 
using T4 ligase. All products were indexed and sequenced 
on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed in 
Supplementary Table S4 . 
All yeast variant libraries were transformed into their 
matched strain using a 40 × scaled-up version of the Zymo 
Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit. After a recovery for 
1 h in Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose media (YPD) and an 
overnight growth shaking at 30 ◦C in 2% raffinose SD-URA- 
HIS, a time = 0-h sample was taken and then yeast were pas- 
saged to 0.2 OD into 50 ml 2% galactose SD-URA-HIS. Cells 
were then grown for 24 h shaking at 30 ◦C, a time = 24-h 
sample was taken. The yeast were then passaged again to 0.2 
optical density at 600 nm (OD600) in 50 ml 2% galactose SD- 
URA-HIS and grown for another 24 h shaking at 30 ◦C. After 
a total of 48 h of editing, the yeast optical densities were mea- 
sured again and two aliquots of 500 million cells each were 
collected for the time = 48-h plasmid and genome sample. 
Yeast genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted as previously 
described ( 19 ). Briefly, cells were lysed in 120 μl lysis buffer 
(100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid pH 8, 50 mM Tris–
HCl pH 8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and boiled for 15 min 
at 100 ◦C. After cooling the lysate on ice, proteins were pre- 
cipitated by adding 60 μl of ice-cold 7.5 M ammonium ac- 
etate and incubating at −20 ◦C for 10 min. The samples were 
centrifuged at 17 000 × g for 15 min to pellet the protein, 
and the supernatant containing the gDNA was transferred 
to a new tube. The gDNA was precipitated in 1:1 ice-cold 
isopropanol at 4 ◦C for 15 min, and then washed twice with 
200 μl ice-cold 70% ethanol. The DNA pellet was dried at 
65 ◦C for 5–10 min to evaporate all ethanol, and resuspended 
in 40 μl water. Then, gDNA samples for deep-sequencing 
were amplified using primers around the editing site con- 
taining Illumina adapters. All products were indexed and se- 
quenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed 
in Supplementary Table S4 . 
Yeast plasmid DNA was extracted as previously described 
( 31 ). The Zymo Yeast Miniprep Kit was scaled up to 500m 
cells. Briefly, we resuspended yeast in 1 ml digestion buffer and 
30 μl zymolyase, and digested the cell wall for 3 h shaking at 
900 r.p.m. at 37 ◦C. We then added 1 ml of solution II (lysis 
buffer) to the tubes, split the sample across multiple microcen- 
trifuge tubes and added 1:1 solution III (protein precipitation 
buffer). We then spun down the tubes and sequentially added 
the supernatant to the Zymo Yeast Miniprep spin column. Af- 
ter reconsolidating the sample, we washed the spin column 
with 550 μl wash buffer and eluted in 20 μl pre-warmed ultra- 
pure nuclease-free H 2 O at 37 ◦C. 
To prepare the plasmid samples for sequencing without the 
creation of hybrid products, we amplified the plasmid bar- 
codes using 50 ng of plasmid DNA and 16 cycles of am- 
plification, performing eight reactions in parallel per sam- 
ple using primers containing the Illumina adapters. We then 
pooled the PCRs for each sample and removed primer-dimers 
through size-selective bead clean-up. We then use 5 μl of 
the cleaned-up plasmid DNA amplicons for indexing and se- 
quencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed 
in Supplementary Table S4 . 
Machine learning submethods 
We split the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA variants and the associated 
msDNA production values into 2930 training sequences, 154 
validation sequences and 342 test sequences. We then trained 
a convolutional neural network using one-hot-encoded retron 
ncRNA sequences as inputs and msDNA production as the 
output. The model parameters that were optimized using Ray 
Tune were number of layers, step size and number of dila- 
tions with a 3:1 train:validation scheme. The final model was 
made of two computational blocks and a residual dilated 
convolution block followed by a two-layer perceptron. All 
model code will be available on GitHub prior to peer-reviewed 
publication. 
Human editing expression and analysis 
All HEK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Ea- 
gle’s medium + GlutaMax supplement (Thermo Fisher 
4 Nucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 
Scientific 10566016) + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (HI-FBS). The six-well cultures were transiently trans- 
fected with 7.32 μg of plasmid per well using Lipofec- 
tamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours 
after transfection, doxycycline was refreshed and cultures 
were passaged into T-25 flasks to be grown for an addi- 
tional 48 h. Three days after transfection, cells were collected 
for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). DAPI dye was 
added to stain for live / dead and cells were gaited on DAPI 
and GFP with untransfected cells used as a negative control 
for background (BD FACSAria Fusion). 
Human sample preparation 
To prepare samples for sequencing, sorted cells were collected 
and gDNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit ac- 
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted 
in 50 μl of ultra-pure, nuclease-free water. 
Two microliter of the gDNA was used as template in 25- 
μl PCR reactions with primer pairs to amplify the locus of 
interest which also contained adapters for Illumina sequenc- 
ing preparation. Lastly, the amplicons were indexed, and se- 
quenced on an Illumina MiSeq / NextSeq instrument. 
msDNA production quantification 
msDNA production was quantified as previously described 
( 19 ). Briefly, custom Python software was used to extract the 
variant counts from the plasmid and msDNA samples. We 
then normalized raw counts to relative abundance (raw count 
over the total number of raw counts) and a variant’s ms- 
DNA relative abundance to the same variant’s plasmid relative 
abundance, using the average of the pre- and post-induction 
plasmid abundances to integrate the plasmid abundance over 
the 5-h expression window . Finally , these relative abundances 
were normalized to the Retron-Eco1 wild-type abundance, set 
at 100%. 
Editing rate quantification 
Custom software was built to quantify library-scale and indi- 
vidual validation editing rates in yeast and human cells. For 
yeast variant libraries, raw barcode counts were pulled from 
the 48-h genome (editing site) samples, and the 0-, 24- and 48- 
h plasmid samples. The read counts from the plasmids were 
summed across the three time samples to integrate the plasmid 
abundances over the editing window, and then each barcode 
read count was normalized against all barcode read counts in 
that sample. The relative abundance of an editor’s barcode in 
the genome was then divided by the relative abundance of an 
editor’s barcode in the integrated plasmid pool. 
For human validation of individual variants, custom soft- 
ware was used to assess the number of reads with the precise 
edit divided by the number of reads with the wild-type se- 
quence. All types of software used in the analysis of this paper 
are available on GitHub. 
Results 
msDNA production in E. coli from Retron-Eco1 
ncRNA variant libraries 
The Retron-Eco1 ncRNA is a highly structured RNA molecule 
with characteristic stem-loops and double-stranded regions 
that is partially reverse transcribed to generate abundant 
RT-DNA, or msDNA in cells (Figure 1 A). As previous work 
found msDNA production was a limiting factor in using the 
retron as a template for precise editing in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes and as a DNA barcode for molecular record- 
ing ( 12 , 19 , 23 ), we set out to systematically understand how 
variations in ncRNA sequence and structure impact msDNA 
production in E. coli . We constructed a 3443 member li- 
brary of ncRNA variants, changing both the msr (non-reverse- 
transcribed region) and msd (reverse-transcribed region). This 
library contained all single-nucleotide substitutions, scanning 
deletions and insertions of varying sizes and variations on 
length and complementary of stem-loops and all permutation 
of the three-nucleotide RT recognition motif in the P3 loop. 
For variants with changes in the msr , we included a linked 
barcode in the P4 loop of the msDNA to allow amplification 
of the barcode via PCR. In all msr sublibraries, we also in- 
cluded a pseudo-wild-type control for normalization which 
had a linked barcode on the P4 loop to control for the effect 
of adding 10 nucleotides on msDNA production. The library 
was constructed using Golden Gate cloning, transformed into 
a B-strain E. coli bSLS.114 (BL21-AI /Delta1Retron-Eco1), and ex- 
pressed along with the Retron-Eco1 RT for 5 h, after which 
we collected msDNA for quantification. All variant sequences 
are included in Supplementary Tables S9 –S18 . 
To quantify the msDNA abundance of msd variants, we 
used a sequencing pipeline described previously that allows us 
to amplify msDNA without requiring prior knowledge of the 
msDNA sequence ( 4 , 12 , 19 ). Briefly, we (i) purified short ss- 
DNA using a QIAGEN Midiprep Plasmid Plus Kit followed by 
a Zymo ssDNA Clean & Concentrator Kit, (ii) treated the re- 
sulting ssDNA with Dbr1 to remove the 2 ′ –5 ′ linkage between 
the msDNA and ncRNA, (iii) extended the debranched ss- 
DNA with a single polynucleotide using template-independent 
polymerase (TdT), (iv) generated a complementary strand us- 
ing a primer consisting of the complementary single polynu- 
cleotide and an Illumina adaptor, (v) ligated an adaptor to the 
other end of the now double-stranded msDNA and lastly (vi) 
Illumina sequenced the now double-stranded msDNA with Il- 
lumina adaptors on both ends. msDNA barcodes linked to 
changes in the msr were quantified by amplifying the barcode 
for sequencing after purifying ssDNA. All variants were nor- 
malized against the production of the wild-type retron-derived 
msDNA and the abundance of the variant plasmid (Figure 
1 B). To quantify the relative abundance of each variant plas- 
mid in the expression cells, we amplified the variable region 
of the ncRNA using plasmid-specific primers and sequenced 
the amplicons using Illumina sequencing. 
Figure 1 C shows single-nucleotide substitutions scanning 
across the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA, where we found substantial 
sequence flexibility on the single-nucleotide level except at 
two important positions: around the priming guanosine im- 
mediately after the a1 region, previously shown to be impor- 
tant for making the 2 ′ –5 ′ linkage of ncRNA-to-msDNA ( 32 ); 
and around the previously known UUU putative recognition 
loop for the Retron-Eco1 RT ( 33 ) (Figure 1 C; Supplementary 
Figure S1 b–e). 
We also analyzed deletions scanning across the Retron- 
Eco1 ncRNA that varied in length from one to five nu- 
cleotides. The Retron-Eco1 ncRNA is less tolerant to dele- 
tions than substitutions, particularly in the msr P2 and P3 
stem loops, suggesting a greater influence of structure over se- 
quence. In addition, deletions in the msd region directly flank- 
ing the a2 region were not tolerated. Larger deletions are less

Figure 1. msDNA production of Retron-Eco1 variant libraries in E. coli . ( A ) W ild-t ype -Eco1 ncRNA str uct ure. ( B ) Variant library schematic: variants were 
introduced on the msr (non-re v erse-transcribed part of the ncRNA) or the msd (re v erse-transcribed part of the ncRNA). After production of the msDNA 
libraries in E. coli, ssDNA was sequenced and variants quantified. msd variants were identified on the msDNA, while msr variants were identified 
through a barcode in the P4 loop. ( C ) msDNA production of all single-nucleotide substitutions relative to wild-type msDNA. Each open circle represents 
the mean of three biological replicates. ( D ) msDNA production of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 nucleotide deletions starting at a specified ncRNA position relative to 
wild-type msDNA. Each open circle represents the mean of three biological replicates. ( E ) msDNA production of 1, 3 and 5 nucleotide insertions starting 
at a specified ncRNA position relative to wild-type msDNA. Each open circle represents the mean of three biological replicates. ( F ) Summary of msDNA 
production relative to wild-type msDNA production of all single-nucleotide variants: insertions (pink), deletions (blue) and substitutions (green). msDNA 
production relative to wild-type msDNA is shown across the nucleotide positions in the ncRNA from 5 ′ to 3 ′ . The black line on top is the mean of msDNA 
production of all the changes at that nucleotide position. Each open circle represents the mean of three biological replicates. ( G ) msDNA abundance of 
removing complement arit y (black) and restoring complement arit y (white) of stem P4 with different nucleotides along the dist ance from stem base 
relative to wild-type msDNA abundance. Each circle represents the mean of three biological replicates with error bars representing the standard error. 
The effect of breaking the stem is significant (one-way ANO V A using only broken stem and wild-type data, P < 0.0001) at positions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 20 
and 21 compared with the wild-type stem (position 1, P = 0.005; position 4, P = 0.0254; position 5, P = 0.0261 position 6, P = 0.0194; position 7, P = 
0.0 0 07; position 8, P = 0.003; position 18, P = 0.0045; position 20, P = 0.0164; position 21, P = 0.0208) (Dunnett’s corrected). Restoring the stem 
str uct ure significantly increases msDNA production only at positions 7 and 21 (position 7, P = 0.0023; position 21, P = 0.0285) (Bonferroni corrected for 
multiple comparisons). ( H ) msDNA abundance of removing complement arit y (black) and restoring complement arit y (white) of stem P2 with different 
nucleotides along the distance from stem base relative to wild-type msDNA abundance. Each circle represents the mean of three biological replicates 
with error bars representing the standard error. The effect of breaking the stem is significant (one-way ANO V A using only broken stem and wild-type 
data, P < 0.0001) at all positions compared with the wild-type stem e x cept position 7 compared with the wild-type stem (position 1, P < 0.0001; position 
2, P < 0.0 0 01; position 3, P < 0.0 0 01; position 4, P < 0.0 0 01; position 5, P < 0.0 0 01; position 6, P < 0.0 0 01; position 7, P = 0.7977; position 8, P = 
0.0029) (Dunnett’s corrected). Restoring the stem str uct ure significantly increases msDNA production at positions 1, 2, 3 and 5 (position 1, P = 0.01; 
position 2, P = 0.001; position 3, P < 0.0001; position 5, P = 0.03) (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). ( I ) msDNA abundance of removing 
complement arit y (black) and restoring complement arit y (white) of stem P3 with different nucleotides along the distance from stem base relative to

breaking the stem is significant (one-w a y ANO V A using only broken stem dat a, P < 0.0 0 01) at all positions compared with the wild-t ype stem (position 
1, P < 0.0 0 01; position 2, P < 0.0 0 01; position 3, P < 0.0 0 01; position 4, P < 0.0 0 01; position 5, P < 0.0 0 01) (Dunnett’s corrected). Restoring the stem

scaled on the red–white color bar, while the standard deviation is represented by the blue around the squares of the heat map. Each square represents 
the mean of three biological replicates. There is a significant effect of the RT recognition motif (one-way ANO V A, P < 0.0 0 01), with every permutation 
significantly different than the wild-type UUU ( P < 0.0001) e x cept UUA and AUU ( P = 0.8991 and P = 0.0551, respectively) (Dunnett’s corrected).

tolerated than smaller deletions in the critical region of the P3 
stem-loop (Figure 1 D; Supplementary Figure S1 f–j). 
We also assessed one-, three- and five-nucleotide insertions 
scanning across the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA (Figure 1 E). While 
small insertions were slightly more tolerated than small dele- 
tions ( Supplementary Figure S1 g, k and l), larger insertions 
in the msr region resulted in undetectable levels of msDNA 
( Supplementary Figure S1 m). Similarly to deletions, insertions 
directly adjacent to the a2 region in msd also greatly reduced 
msDNA production. 
A summary of the effect of all nucleotide substitutions, 
deletions and insertions is shown in Figure 1 F. Generally, the 
Retron-Eco1 ncRNA tolerates modifications in the P2 and 
P4 stem-loops, but is relatively intolerant to modifications 
around the priming guanosine and the stem-loop P3. The tol- 
erance to mutations in the P4 stem is important for the use 
of Retron-Eco1 in biotechnology, as this is the position where 
editing donors and DNA barcodes have been encoded. 
Next, we sought to assess the effect of structural variations. 
To do this, we quantified the effect of breaking complemen- 
tarity in stem-loops P2, P3 and P4 by replacing one side of 
the stem with a non-complementary new sequence to create a 
nucleotide bubble of length 4 in stem-loops P2 and P3, and 
length 5 in stem-loop P4. To control for an effect of a se- 
quence versus structural change, we also restored complemen- 
tarity by changing the same position on the other side of the 
stem with the complement of the replaced nucleotides. Break- 
ing P4 complementarity only affected msDNA production at 
the base and the tip of the stem, and fixing complementar- 
ity with different sequences restored wild-type levels of ms- 
DNA production (Figure 1 G). Breaking stem-loop P2 com- 
plementarity closer to the base reduced msDNA production 
and restoring complementarity restored msDNA production 
(Figure 1 H). Breaking stem-loop P3 complementarity reduces 
msDNA production, but restoring complementarity with an 
alternate sequence does not restore msDNA production (Fig- 
ure 1 I). Overall, there are clear structural requirements, most 
notably in P2 / 3: in P2, structure is important; and in P3, both 
sequence and structure are important for msDNA production. 
We next sought to quantify how strictly required the UUU 
recognition motif in the loop of P3 is for RT recognition 
(Figure 1 J). Testing every permutation of the UUU motif re- 
veals low sequence flexibility in position 3 (vertical axis) 
and position 2 (bottom axis), requiring both of these to be 
uracils. However, there is significant flexibility in position 1, 
with every possible base approaching wild-type msDNA pro- 
duction levels (lower right square, UUU), with GUU hav- 
ing higher msDNA production than wild-type (Figure 1 K; 
Supplementary Figure S2 ). 
Machine learning on libraries reveals novel 
variables to increase msDNA production 
Though we tested ∼3400 variants of the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA 
including all single-nucleotide substitutions, a variant library 
of all possible nucleotide combinations would number on the 
order of 10 90 variants, without including insertions and dele- 
tions. Therefore, to explore more of the possible sequence 
space, we used the ncRNA variant library data to create a ma- 
chine learning algorithm capable of predicting novel retron 
ncRNA sequences with enhanced msDNA production. The 
experimental values across ∼3400 measurements were inverse 
normal transformed and split into a train, validation and test 
sets. A convolutional neural network, named retDNN, was 
then used to learn the relationship between sequence and ms- 
DNA levels. The retDNN model comprises of two compu- 
tational blocks and a residual dilated convolution block fol- 
lowed by a two-layer perceptron. The model was trained on 
3084 measurements and tested on the held-out set, achieving 
an R = 0.671 performance ( R = 0.775 on the training set) 
(Figure 2 A and B). We then queried the retDNN model with 
in silico variants, including a P4 stem-loop of varying GC con- 
tent. Interestingly, the model predicted that lowering GC con- 
tent in the P4 stem-loop would increase msDNA production 
over wild-type, something untested in the original variant li- 
brary. To validate this prediction, we synthesized and cloned 
the 500 queried variants of differing GC contents (25 variants 
per 10% GC content range) and experimentally validated ms- 
DNA production relative to wild-type through the same se- 
quencing pipeline as above. As the algorithm predicted, lower 
GC percentages of the P4 stem-loop produced more msDNA 
(Figure 2 C). 
Editing performance in S. cerevisiae of Retron-Eco1 
ncRNA variant libraries 
Efficient msDNA production is critical for retron biotech- 
nology, including the use of msDNA as the donor for pre- 
cise genome editing. In this context, a Retron-Eco1 ncRNA 
is modified to encode a precise repair donor in the stem-loop 
of P4 and a gRNA for Cas9 double-strand DNA cleavage at 
the 3 ′ end of the ncRNA. This combination of CRISPR-Cas9 
and retron immune systems has been called CRISPEY in yeast 
( 18 ) or as an editron ( 12 ) to encompass its use in all eukary- 
otic cells. After determining the effect of ncRNA variations 
on msDNA production in E. coli , we sought to extend this un- 
derstanding to editing and additionally investigate how donor, 
gRNA and ncRNA chassis variants all together affect precise 
editing rates in eukaryotes. 
We designed a library to assess the contributions of struc- 
tural, cut site and donor variables to precise genome editing 
by encoding unique donors in the P4 loop of the ncRNA, with 
each donor variant inserting a unique 10-bp barcode into the 
yeast genome at a designated site, along with changing the 
NGG S. pyogenes Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to 
NAT to prevent re-targeting of the edited site. We synthesized 
variant libraries for the same variables across three unique 
sites: two artificial, constructed sites with designed, symmet- 
ric PAMs around the edit site, and one site from the human 
genome (an intron in the NPAS2 gene) with the same PAM 
locations as the constructed sites. These three sites were in- 
dependently integrated into the HIS locus of S. cerevisiae to 
interrogate the local sequence effects on the editing efficiency, 
while ensuring the editing site remains active and open by also 
providing a copy of the HIS gene in HIS auxotrophic yeast, 
and maintaining strains in HIS media. 
In these variant libraries, we assessed: five donor lengths 
(54, 64, 78, 94 and 112 nucleotides), five homology arm sym- 
metries about the edit site per donor length, msDNA donors 
that are complementary to the target or non-target strand and 
five different cut sites ( −16, −8, 0, +8 and +16 relative to 
barcode insertion point), leading to 175 donor / gRNA com- 
binations per site (Figure 3 A). We then combinatorially com- 
bined these donor / gRNA variants with 25 different ncRNA 
chassis: wild-type Eco1 ncRNA, CRISPEY ncRNA ( 18 ), the 
13 best-performing structural variants from the E. coli

variant libraries and 10 de novo predicted ncRNAs from the 
machine learning algorithm. In all, we tested 4275 variants 
per site. All variant sequences are included in Supplementary 
Tables S6 –S8 . 
Three independent yeast lines were created, each with one 
of the three sites in the HIS locus of the yeast genome 
along with Cas9 and Retron-Eco1 RT under the control of 
a GAL1 / 10 galactose-inducible divergent promoter (Figure 
3 B). These synthesized ncRNA variants for each site were en- 
coded on a vector containing other necessary ncRNA com- 
ponents (ribozymes, tracrRNA) under the GAL7 galactose- 
inducible promoter (Figure 3 C). After transformation of the 
editing libraries into yeast, editing was performed for 48 h in 
galactose media. 
To analyze the data, we sequenced the barcode distribution 
in the plasmid pool and the barcodes inserted into the cor- 
rect site in the yeast genome after 48 h of editing. First, we 
calculated the proportion of each barcode’s reads in the pool 
of reads (for barcodes edited into the genome: the reads at 
48 h of editing; for barcodes in the plasmid pool: the reads 
as summed over samples taken at 0, 24 and 48 h of edit- 
ing). This is to integrate the plasmid barcode pool over the 
entire editing period. Plasmid barcode read count was stable 
over the 48 h of editing ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Then, we 
normalized the individual barcode proportions as seen in the 
genome to the same barcode’s proportion as seen in the plas- 
mid pool (called barcode representation henceforth), and re- 
moved barcodes not seen at counts > 10 in the plasmid pool or 
not seen at all in the genome pool (percent of working editors 
per library variable is shown in the Supplementary Figure S4 ). 
We then normalized along the axis of interest. For example, 
when assessing the effect of donor msDNA complementary to 
either the target or non-target strand (target strand: strand 
complementary to the gRNA / complementary to the PAM- 
containing strand; non-target strand: strand not complemen- 
tary to gRNA / PAM-containing strand), we held all other vari- 
ables constant (donor length, cut site, donor center and chas- 
sis) and normalized the target strand barcode representation 
to the non-target strand barcode representation of each spe- 
cific group. This normalized barcode representation for ev- 
ery barcode for each biological replicate for each site is rep- 
resented as a transparent circle in Figure 3 D. We then took 
the median of each biological replicate of each site, based on 
the distribution on the right of Figure 3 D, and averaged those 
across all sites to obtain the summary figure for that axis of 
interest. After performing this normalization, we found that, 
on average, target strand donors are worse editors than non- 
target strand donors because the barcode was inserted less 
often when holding all other variables constant, performing 
at about 50% efficiency as compared with the matched non- 
target strand donors (Figure 3 E). Both target strand and non- 
target strand donors have about 50% functional editor vari- 
ants, as other parameters also influence if an editor is func- 
tional ( Supplementary Figure S4 a). When examining whether 
cut position relative to edit affects strand polarity preferences, 
we find that donors complementary to the non-target strand 
perform worse or equal to donors complementary to the tar- 
get strand, regardless of whether the cut is positioned on the 
5 ′ or 3 ′ side of the edit ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). 
We analyzed the effect of cut site positioning relative to in- 
sertion point by using Cas9 spacer sequences eight nucleotides 
apart and analyzing as above, normalizing within-group to a 
cut position of 0, the site at which Cas9 cuts directly where 
the 10-bp barcode is then inserted. We noticed that the cut 
site of −8 for site 2 had an unusually low number of working 
donors ( < 20%), which was not observed when using other 
gRNAs at site 2 or with the −8 position at sites 1 and 3 
( Supplementary Figure S4 b). Given that we intend to quan- 
tify the effect of editron parameters and not local sequence 
around the gRNA, we excluded editrons with the −8 gRNA 
at site 2 from analysis. At site 1 and 3, we found that an edit 
on the PAM-proximal side of the cut site performed slightly 
better ( ∼130% efficiency at the cut site of −8 compared with 
a cut position of 0) and performed much better than an edit 
on the PAM-distal side of the cut site ( ∼65% efficiency at the 
cut site of +8), with consistency across sites, while cut sites far

lengths, two donor directions relative to the gRNA and five donor centers relative to edit and cut position for a total of 50 donors per editing site. There 
are five evenly spaced gRNAs per site relative to the edit position, for 250 donor / gRNA pairs per site. ( B ) There are 25 ncRNA chassis per donor / gRNA 
combination. Three sites integrated into the HIS locus of the yeast genome were tested: two synthesized and one from the human genome (NPAS2 
locus). ( C ) Schematic for 4275 variant plasmids per site in the library. Each variant has a unique 10-bp barcode that can be read out from the plasmid or 
from the edit site in the genome. ( D ) All target-strand-homologous gRNA / donor variants’ barcode representation normalized against its non-target 
strand homologous gRNA / donor variant, with all other variables held constant (chassis, donor length, center and gRNA). The variants for each site are 
broken apart from one another and plotted in different colors, and each biological replicate of a site is summarized by the median (left panel) of the 
distribution of variants (right panel). ( E ) Data in Figure 3 E summarized as the mean of all sites and all biological replicates (closed circle) ( ±standard 
deviation), with target-strand-homologous donors editing at significantly lower frequencies (one-sample t -test; P < 0.0 0 01). ( F ) Barcode representation 
of cut sites normalized to the cut site at the barcode insertion site ( ±standard deviation), with cut sites at −16, +8 and +16 editing at significantly lo w er 
frequencies (one-sample t -test, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; P < 0.0 0 01, P < 0.0 0 01 and P < 0.0 0 01, respectively, all other 
comparisons non-significant). ( G ) Barcode representation of donor lengths normalized to 94 nucleotide donor length ( ±standard deviation), with donor 
lengths < 94 nucleotides editing at significantly lo w er frequencies (one-sample t -test, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; P < 0.0 0 01, 
P < 0.0 0 01 and P < 0.01, respectively, all other comparisons non-significant). ( H ) Heat map of normalized barcode representation of cut site versus

from the insertion point resulted in lower frequency of precise 
editing ( ∼40–45% efficiency) (Figure 3 F). However, it should 
be noted that only donors complementary to the non-target 
strand were included in this part of the editron library. 
We examined the effect of donor length, normalizing 
within-group to a donor length of 94 nucleotides. In general, 
longer donors were more efficient editors than shorter donors, 
with a 54 nucleotide donor editing at ∼10% of the rate of to 
the 94 nucleotide donors, while 112 nucleotide had ∼130% 
efficiency compared with the 94 nucleotide donor (Figure 3 G). 
The percentage of working donors per donor length also in- 
creased with donor length ( Supplementary Figure S4 c). 
We assessed the effect of donor center and cut site together 
by first fixing the donor length (so each donor length is sep- 
arately analyzed) and then normalizing within-group to the 
centered cut site (0) and centered donor (–5). The data for 
94 nucleotide donor length is shown, as each different donor 
length has different donor center points. All other donor 
length results are shown in Supplementary Figure S6 . As the 
higher normalized barcode representation goes from top left 
to bottom right for the 94 nucleotide donor, it was generally 
better to center the donor around the cut site than the inser- 
tion point, except for cases of cut sites very far from insertion 
point (top left and bottom right). In addition, for 94 nucleotide 
donors, when cut and insertion points were overlapping, a 
slightly PAM-proximal shifted donor performed slightly bet- 
ter than centered, at 110% efficiency compared with centered 
(Figure 3 H). We observed similar but not identical results at 
other donor lengths ( Supplementary Figure S6 ), potentially 
because symmetry requirements shift as donor length changes 
or due to outliers in those donor lengths. The percentage of 
working donors for donor center and cut site is included in 
Supplementary Figure S7 . 
Finally, we analyzed the effect of ncRNA chassis, normaliz- 
ing within-group to the original CRISPEY chassis. In general, 
no structural variants performed worse than the CRISPEY 
chassis, and several variants performed significantly better (27 
bp a1 / a2 extension, 10 and 12 bp P4 stem length, deletion at 
position 139, C144T and T147A and machine learning (ML) 
chassis 8 and 9) (Figure 3 I). Excitingly, we found that the ma- 
chine learning-predicted chassis supported equally high rates 
of editing despite deviating from the natural sequence by 55–
80% in the 20 nucleotide ML variable region, or up to 12% 
over the full Retron-Eco1 ncRNA including the 27-bp ex- 
tended a1 / a2 (logo map of ribonucleotide usage across the 
machine learning variable region in Supplementary Figure S9 ). 
Specific machine learning chassis structures and sequences can 
be found in Supplementary Figure S8 . We found no evidence 
of a difference in the percentage of working donors across 
ncRNA chassis ( Supplementary Figure S10 ). 
Library-informed optimization of human editing 
We next sought to understand if design rules learned in E. coli 
and S. cerevisiae extend to editing in human cells. Editrons 
contain the same constituent parts in human cells as in yeast, 
except for the editing ncRNA is driven by an H1 promoter for 
nuclear retention rather than being flanked by ribozymes. Our 
plasmids included an EGFP and Retron-Eco1 RT separated by 
a P2A driven by a CAG constitutive promoter and a ncRNA 
containing an editing donor fused to a single-guide RNA 
(sgRNA) driven by a Pol III H1 promoter. The addition of the 
EGFP enables selection of cells successfully transfected with 
at least one copy of the editing plasmid. The editing donors 
consist of a sequence homologous to the desired editing site 
in the genome but including a PAM recode (NGG > NAT), 
and a single nucleotide change. We chose to target an intron 
in the endogenous NPAS2 site for human validation, using the 
exact ncRNA constructs used in the yeast libraries. All donors 
tested are included in Supplementary Table S5 . 
The editron plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells 
containing an integrated doxycycline-inducible Cas9, whose 
expression was induced 24 h before transfection. Cells were 
collected 3 days after transfection and sorted via FACS to only 
include live and transfected cells, eliminating any variability 
to due transfection efficiency (Figure 4 A). We used gRNA 5 
for human validation, after an initial screen for gRNA effi- 
cacy showed it to have the highest rates of insertions / deletions 
(indels) of the three tested gRNAs, indicating highest cutting 
efficiency (Figure 4 B). Consistent with our earlier findings in 
yeast, we demonstrated that a longer donor and a donor ho- 
mologous to the non-target strand improve editing efficiency 
(Figure 4 C and D). A 112 nucleotide donor increased precise 
editing from ∼5 to ∼12%, while a non-target strand homol- 
ogous donor increased editing from ∼4 to ∼12%. 
We chose to validate three chassis modifications in human 
cells. Longer a1 / 2 length increased editing compared with 
wild-type a1 / a2 length. Excitingly, ML modifications enabled 
successful editing despite only 30% sequence similarity to 
wild-type, demonstrating the flexibility of the region (Figure 
4 E). Next, we sought to determine the ideal positioning of 
both the edit and the donor relative to a set cut site. We tested 
three edits: a middle edit at the cut site, an edit 20 bp upstream 
of the cut site, and an edit 20 bp downstream of the cut site. 
For each of these edits, we tested a donor which was non- 
symmetric about the edit with more homology on the 5 ′ side of 
the non-target strand, centered on the edit, or non-symmetric 
about the edit with more homology to the 3 ′ side of the edit 
site on the non-target strand (Figure 4 F). All donors used were 
complementary to the non-target strand. We found that plac- 
ing an edit at the cut site and on the PAM-proximal side both 
allowed successful editing, with a slight trend favoring the 
central cut. Additionally, the trend shows that a donor cen- 
tered on the cut or with more homology on the PAM-proximal 
side donor both enable editing. None of the conditions with 
the edit on the PAM-distal side were edited successfully 
(Figure 4 G). 
Based on all our variant testing, we provide a set of gen- 
eralizable design principles for creating future editrons for 
new targets. Testing several gRNAs to achieve optimal cut- 
ting efficiency is an important first step based on our findings 
showing the variability in indel rates among guides. Donors 
should be parallel to the guide and complementary to the non- 
target strand as msDNA, with a 112 nucleotide donor having 
the highest precise editing rate. Additionally, the cut should 
be centered or non-symmetrically shifted toward the PAM- 
proximal side of the non-target strand. When modifying the 
ncRNA, the a1 / 2 should be extended at least to 23bp. We also 
demonstrate flexibility in the 3 ′ region and the P4 length of the 
ncRNA, allowing for modifications as needed (Figure. 4 H). 
Discussion 
In this work, we comprehensively evaluated the effect of 
ncRNA variations on msDNA production in bacteria from 
which we trained and validated a ML model. We then

Figure 4. Validating yeast editing libraries with individual human variants. ( A ) Human editing schematic. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid 
containing the editing ncRNA variant with a single nucleotide transversion as a precise edit, along with recoding the PAM NGG to NAT. The plasmid also 
contained a constitutively driven GFP-P2A-Eco1 RT. The editron targeted an intronic region of the NPAS2 gene on Chromosome 2 (‘site 3’ in the yeast 
data in Figure 3 ). The HEK293T line also had semi-randomly integrated S. p y ogenes Cas9 b y PiggyB ac transposase under a dox-inducible promoter and a 
C-terminal NLS. Se v enty -tw o hours after transfection, the HEK293T cells were sorted as GFP+ / DAPI − (alive transfected cells) and their genomes were 
sequenced for precise edits. ( B ) Indel percent of the three tested gRNAs. Individual biological replicates are open circles. All gRNA indel rates are 
statistically different from one another (one-w a y ANO V A, P < 0.0 0 01; B onferroni post hoc test sho w ed P < 0.05 f or all comparisons). ( C ) P recise editing 
percentages of 52 nucleotide and 112 nucleotide long donors. Individual biological replicates are open circles. The 112 nucleotide donor is a significantly 
more efficient editor (paired t -test, P = 0.025). ( D ) Precise editing percentages of target and non-target strand homologous donors. Individual biological 
replicates are open circles. Non-target strand homologous donors are significantly more efficient editors (paired t -test, P = 0.043). ( E ) Precise editing 
percentages of four ncRNA chassis: wild-type Eco1 ncRNA, extended P1 (a1 / a2) (23 and 27 bp) and machine learning chassis 9. Individual biological 
replicates are open circles. There is a significant effect of ncRNA chassis (one-way ANO V A, P = 0.01), with a1 / a2 extensions of 23 ( P = 0.0267) and 27 
bp ( P = 0.0046) performing significantly better than wild-type and ML chassis 9 not performing worse than wild-type ( P = 0.0993) (Dunnett’s corrected). 
( F ) Schematic of donor center relative to precise edit site and cut site. Three precise edits were spaced 20-bp apart, with the cut site centered on the 
middle edit. Three different donor positions were used per edit: 5 ′ -sided, centered and 3 ′ -sided. ( G ) Precise editing percentages of the nine different 
donor center / edit combinations. Three datapoints in the central cut / centered donor are repeated from (D), as these replicates served as the controls for 
both the donor center / cut site experiment and the target strand experiment. There is a significant effect of edit site and donor symmetry (one-way 
ANO V A, P = 0.0 0 02), with all edits on the PAM-distal side of the cut ( P = 0.0014 for 5 ′ donor center, P = 0.0012 for centered donor and P = 0.0016 for 3 ′ 
centered donor) and the 3 ′ donor center on the PAM-proximal side ( P = 0.0 0 09) performing significantly worse than a central cut and edit (Dunnett’s 
corrected). ( H ) Schematic illustrating final recommendations for editron design.

evaluated the effect of variations in donor and gRNA, along 
with ncRNA structure, on editing efficiency in yeast; and val- 
idated the major findings in human cells. From these variant 
libraries, we found that the msd region of the ncRNA is gen- 
erally tolerant to alterations, specifically the stem-loop P4, in 
which programmable sequences for biotechnology can be in- 
serted, like a donor sequence for precise editing or a transcrip- 
tion factor motif for attenuating transcription factor activity. 
We also characterized regions of the msr that are required 
for efficient reverse transcription, such as testing every per- 
mutation of the RT recognition motif in stem-loop P3 where 
the Retron-Eco1 RT initiates reverse transcription ( 33 ) and 
the UAGC sequence which includes the priming guanosine 
( 33 ). In terms of editing parameters, we found higher rates 
of editing by increasing donor and a1 / a2 length, and using 
a centered or slightly asymmetric donor with more homol- 
ogy on the PAM-proximal side of the non-target strand. We 
also demonstrated significant flexibility in the 3 ′ side of the 
msd sequence for editing, which we altered with targeted dele- 
tions, single-nucleotide changes, and stem length alterations. 
We also changed the 3 ′ side of the msd region to machine 
learning predicted de novo variants of 55–80% difference 
from the wild-type sequence in the 20 nucleotide ML variable 
region, or up to 12% over the full Retron-Eco1 ncRNA. 
Editrons are conceptually similar to another precise edit- 
ing approach called prime editing, which uses a nickase Cas9 
fused to a promiscuous RT and a gRNA fused to a short donor. 
The RT extends from the nick using the donor to introduce a 
precise modification after flap excision and heteroduplex res- 
olution ( 34 ). Editrons use prokaryotic, retron RTs, in contrast 
to the mammalian, viral, MMLV RT most typically used in 
prime editors. Retron RTs are smaller than MML V RT , which 
can be advantageous for delivering parts to cells using plas- 
mids or viruses, and are more processive than MML V RT , 
which has enabled much longer insertions ( 18 ) than are possi- 
ble without adding additional proteins, such as Bxb1 recombi- 
nase and a recombination donor ( 35 ) to prime editing. While 
prime editing has been extensively optimized, work like this 
study is necessary to realize the full potential of editrons. 
Our variant libraries agree with previous optimizations 
with single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) in some as- 
pects, and disagree in others. For example, previous work 
on ssODNs has found that ssODNs of 70–80 nucleotides 
have the highest rate of precise repair, and precise repair 
rates decline above 80 nucleotides ( 36 ,37 ). This is contrary 
to our finding that precise editing rates increase with increas- 
ing length of the msDNA past the previously found optimal 
length of ssODNs. This difference could be due to lower DNA 
transfection of longer oligonucleotides or due to the difficulty 
of synthesizing longer oligonucleotides ( 36 ). As our donor 
is created inside the nucleus of the cell by the Retron-Eco1 
RT, our precise editing method will not be limited by syn- 
thesis or transfection limitations. We note that, eventually, 
the Retron-Eco1 RT processivity may hinder production of a 
longer donor, but that we do not believe we have reached that 
limit in this work, or that any processivity losses are offset by 
precise repair gains. 
Prior optimization work of ssODN donors has also found 
that donors asymmetric about the cut site on the non-target 
strand have better precise editing outcomes, agreeing with our 
results ( 9 , 37 , 38 ). After cleavage, Cas9 releases the non-target 
strand, after which a 3 ′ –to–5 ′ exonuclease, like Klenow, de- 
grades the 3 ′ flap ( 39 ). Therefore, homology should be biased 
and asymmetric towards the PAM-proximal side of the non- 
target strand, as this strand is both free and non-degraded. 
We only evaluated asymmetry in a donor homologous to 
the non-target strand in this study. This is because, in both 
yeast and human, across different cut sites, we find donors 
homologous to the non-target strand result in higher precise 
editing than the target strand, as fits with the mechanism of 
Cas9 above and to some ssODN studies ( 36 ). This is contrary 
to other ssODN studies, which find that strand polarity pref- 
erence depends on cut position relative to the edit ( 40 ). How- 
ever, because our editor is a ncRNA reverse-transcribed into 
a donor, we have the additional complexity of RNA:RNA hy- 
bridization. When the reverse-transcribed donor is homolo- 
gous to the target strand, the gRNA would be homologous 
to the donor before reverse transcription and could cause the 
gRNA to be ‘hidden’ from Cas9 through base pairing with 
the ncRNA donor. This is an additional complexity not eval- 
uated in optimizing ssODNs, and may increase the effect we 
observe, with non-target strand complementarity of the donor 
performing better than target strand complementarity and be 
the reason some ssODN studies find locus-dependence for 
strand preference, while we do not, though more loci will need 
to be tested before fully making this claim ( 37 ). 
Our first variant library in E. coli was aimed at understand- 
ing parameters in the retron ncRNA that influence msDNA 
production. In contrast, our editron variant library used edit- 
ing as the output, consistent with our goal of identifying pa- 
rameters that influence editing. It is possible that some editing 
gains were due to increased msDNA production while oth- 
ers were due to the creation of more favorable donor–target- 
gRNA interactions. It is likely that the final optimized parts 
strike a balance between gains in msDNA production and 
gains from having ideal editing components. Ultimately, our 
high-throughput approach to testing thousands of variants 
enabled us to sample a wide space, including potential com- 
promises between the multiple parameters influencing editing, 
which would have been impossible with traditional experi- 
ments testing one parameter at a time. 
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of us- 
ing variant libraries to train a ML library that we can query 
with de novo retron ncRNA sequences to assess their possi- 
ble msDNA production. This high-throughput computational 
approach allowed us to screen many more sequences in sil- 
ico than currently possible experimentally. Through this, we 
queried and validated new aspects of the ncRNA that can in- 
crease msDNA production, and thus editing. Importantly, we 
were able to use the output of the ML model to make semi- 
synthetic ncRNAs that are as functional as wild-type.
