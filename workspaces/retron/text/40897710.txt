In the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and viruses, retrons have emerged as distinctive antiphage defense systems. Here,
we elucidate the structure and function of Retron-Eco2, which comprises a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that encodes multicopy single-
stranded DNA (msDNA, a DNA‒RNA hybrid) and a fusion protein containing a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain and a
topoisomerase-primase-like (Toprim) effector domain. The Eco2 msDNA and RT-Toprim fusion protein form a 1:1 stoichiometric
nucleoprotein complex that further assembles into a trimer (msDNA:RT-Toprim ratio of 3:3) with a distinctive triangular
conﬁguration. The RNA portion of the msDNA in one protomer closely intertwines around the RT domain of an adjacent protomer,
mediating the formation of this self-inhibitory assembly. Upon activation, the Toprim effector domain exhibits RNase activity,
degrading RNA to arrest phage replication. We further reveal that phage mutants evading Eco2-mediated defense harbor
mutations in the endonuclease IV-like protein DenB, underscoring DenB’s critical role in triggering the activation of this system.
Together, these ﬁndings provide key structural and functional insights into Retron-Eco2, laying the groundwork for harnessing its
potential in biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.

INTRODUCTION
In the ongoing co-evolutionary arms race between prokaryotes
and their viral parasites, bacteria have evolved a multitude of
sophisticated antiviral immune systems with diverse defense
mechanisms
1–8. Among these immune systems, retrons, a class
of widespread genetic elements found in ~11% of the bacterial
genomes, along with their associated effector proteins, have
recently emerged as key players participating in antiphage
defense
3,9–13. A typical retron comprises a reverse transcriptase
(RT) and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA)14. The retron RT reverse-
transcribes the msd segment of the ncRNA (msdRNA) into DNA
(msdDNA), which, together with the msr segment (msrRNA),
forms a single-stranded branched DNA ‒RNA hybrid named
multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA)
9,15–19.B e y o n dt h e i r
biological roles, retrons have attracted interest as versatile tools
for genome engineering due to their ability to synthesize
msDNA
20–33.
Retrons can be classiﬁed into multiple types based on their
associated effector proteins9,10, yet the molecular details of their
antiphage mechanisms remain largely obscure. While a few
systems have been characterized, such as Retron-Eco1 (also
known as Ec86) that formsﬁlamentous complexes and mediates
antiphage defense via NAD+ hydrolysis12,34,35, and Retron-Eco6
(Ec48) that compromises membrane integrity 9, the underlying
defense mechanisms of most retron systems remain poorly
understood. This knowledge gap is especially pronounced for
retrons where the RT and effector reside within a single fusion
protein to function.
Several antiphage/antiplasmid defense system-related proteins
contain integral topoisomerase/primase (Toprim) domains, includ-
ing those found in the overcoming lysogenization defect (OLD)
family proteins
36, Detocs37, Gabija1,38–41, Wadjet42–45, PARIS46–48,
and retron systems3,9,10. Among Type I retrons, Eco2 (also known
as Ec67) stands out for its RT-Toprim fusion protein3,9,49. Previous
studies have indicated that Eco2 assembles into large supramo-
lecular complexes50. Investigating the structural basis of Eco2-
mediated defense and unraveling its mode of action will provide
critical insights into the broader functional roles of Toprim
domains in bacterial immunity.
Here, we purify and characterize the Retron-Eco2 system from
Escherichia coli Cl-1 and determine its cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) structure at 2.6 Å resolution. Weﬁnd that Eco2 forms a
triangular trimer comprising three msDNA-RT-Toprim units. The
RNA part of msDNA interconnects RT domains across adjacent
protomers, creating a self-inhibitory complex. Toprim domains,
arranged as three legs extending from the msDNA-RT core, exhibit
RNase activity upon activation, degrading RNA to arrest phage
replication. Genetic analyses conﬁrm the importance of Toprim
enzymatic activity and implicate the phage-encoded DenB
endonuclease IV-like protein in activating Eco2-mediated defense.
Although Eco2 activation leads to translational inhibition, the
underlying mechanism remains to be explored.

RESULTS
Structural determination of the Retron-Eco2 defense system
We ﬁrst analyzed 3395 retron/retron-like RTs sequences and
constructed a comprehensive phylogenetic tree (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Notably, ~32.8% of these RT proteins are fused with
effector domains, such as Toprim, protease, and Toll/interleukin-1
receptor (TIR) domains. Among these, the Toprim domain is the
most prevalent, accounting for 37% of the effector associations, as
seen in Retron-Eco2. Based on this observation, we focused our
structural and biochemical studies on Eco2 to elucidate its
function.
To elucidate how the Retron-Eco2 system defends against phage
infection, weﬁrst cloned and puriﬁed the RT-Toprim fusion protein
from E. coliS10 (Fig.1a). In contrast to the challenging puriﬁcation
of the Eco1 RT protein, we found that the Eco2 RT-Toprim fusion
protein could be readily puriﬁed, which was eluted at the volume
corresponding to the monomeric form during size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Subsequently, we
co-expressed and puriﬁed RT-Toprim together with its ncRNA, and
observed that the Retron-Eco2 complex assembled into an
oligomeric complex (Supplementary Fig. S2a), consistent with
previous reports
50. The presence of msDNA in the Eco2 complex
was conﬁrmed by UV absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm and
urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) analysis.
To further investigate the assembly of the Retron-Eco2 complex,
we determined its cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.6 Å
(Supplementary Fig. S2b‒f and Table S1). Overall, Retron-Eco2
forms a trimeric, cyclic assembly composed of three msDNA
molecules and three RT-Toprim proteins (three msDNA-RT-Toprim
units). In the Retron-Eco2 trimer, the msDNA-RT portions from
each protomer together adopt a triangular architecture, with the
Toprim domains protruding as three perpendicular“legs” extend-
ing from this triangular base (Fig. 1b). The three RT-Toprim
proteins are held together by the msDNA molecules. The msrRNA
part of each msDNA molecule spans from one RT-Toprim to the
next in a head-to-tail fashion, occupying the active sites of the RT
domain (Fig. 1c, d). Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate the
structural basis of the Eco2 complex.
Eco2 msDNA adopts a three-bladed propeller-like structure
Although different retrons produce msDNAs with varying primary
sequences, they share structural and functional features
10. Similar
to other reported msDNAs, the IRa1/a2 regions at the 5′- and 3′-
ends of the Eco2 ncRNA are complementary and can hybridize.
The Eco2 msr region, which is not reverse transcribed, forms a
single short RNA stem-loop (RSL), while the msd region, composed
of 67 bases, folds into a single long DNA hairpin (DNA stem-loop,
DSL) (Fig. 2).
Within the Eco2 complex, the msrRNA segments of the three
msDNA molecules form a three-bladed propeller-like structure
(Fig. 2b). Each msrRNA comprises a 23-bp RSL (rG20‒rU42) ﬂanked
by two single-stranded tails, designated the 5’-end tail and the
Retron-Eco2 (Ec67) of Escherichia coli S10msr msd

3’-end tail (Fig.2c, f). The 5’-end tail includes IRa2, rG15, and the
single-stranded RNA a (ssRa) segment (rA16‒rU19), while the 3’-
end tail consists of the ssRb (rG43‒rU51) and the RNA portion of
the DNA‒RNA duplex. These tails and the RSL region interact
tightly with the positively charged surface of the RT domain,
stabilizing the trimeric assembly (Fig.2d). Each msrRNA tail in one
protomer associates with an RT-Toprim from another via
electropositive grooves, forming hydrogen bonds between the
protein and the RNA bases (Fig.2d).
In the solved structure, a 9-nt IRa2 is clearly visible, while only
two complementary bases (rC8 and rA9) of IRa1 are resolved
(Fig. 2c, f). The 2′,5′-phosphodiester bond between the branched
guanosine (rG15) and dT1 (the 5′-end of the msdDNA) is observed
in the density map (Fig.2c, e, f). Theﬁnal 11 nucleotides (rG52‒
rA62) at the 3′-end of msrRNA and the nucleotides dT57‒dC67 of
msdDNA form the DNA‒RNA duplex, which is located within the
RT active site (Fig. 2c, f). This conﬁguration shows more paired
bases between the msrRNA template and msdDNA product
compared to previous reports
49,51. Except for dT1 and the DNA
part of the RNA ‒DNA duplex, the cryo-EM density of the
remainder of the msdDNA is weaker, indicating less stable binding
and increased ﬂexibility. Such ﬂexibility, particularly in the DSL
region, may facilitate its role as a sensor of phage infection9,11,34,35.
Retron-Eco2 RT adopts a right-hand-like fold
The full-length Eco2 RT-Toprim protein consists of an N-terminal RT
domain (residues 1‒368) and a C-terminal Toprim domain (residues
369‒586). The N-terminal RT domain adopts the characteristic
right-hand-like fold found in all other known RT structures,
consisting of 16 α-helices and 10 β-strands (Fig. 3a). Structural
alignment indicates that the Eco2 RT domain is related to non-LTR
RTs, including those from group II introns, human long inter-
spersed element-1 (LINE-1) elements, insect R2 elements, and
other eukaryotic non-LTR retrotransposons

further reveals structural similarities to RNA-directed RNA poly-
merases identiﬁed in various RNA viruses (Supplementary Fig. S3a).
We compared several representative RTs from different organisms
based on DALI analysis. While the core RT fold is conserved,
variations occur in each homologous structure. For example, group
IIC introns, DRT2, and LINE-1 possess an additional N-terminal
extension (NTE) domain, while Abi-P2 replaces the thumb domain
with a helical domain (Supplementary Fig. S3b–i). Among non-retron
family RTs, Eco2 RT domain shows the highest structural similarity to
the prokaryotic DRT2 defense system, which can reverse-transcribe
neighboring noncoding RNA into tandem repeats that facilitate the
expression of a toxic repetitive protein
56 (Supplementary Fig. S3a, d).
The trimer interface of Eco2 RT domain is mediated by a loop
region (residues 328 ‒342) primarily through hydrogen bonds
involving amino acids D331, R332, and Y333 (Fig.3b, c). Alanine
substitutions of these residues revealed that R332A abolishes Eco2’s
antiphage activity, while D331A and Y333A have no obvious effect
(Fig. 3d). To conﬁrm whether R332A affects trimer formation, we
puriﬁed the R332A variant and compared it to the wild-type Eco2
complex using SEC. The R332A mutant partially impaired trimer
assembly, indicating that this loop region alone is insufﬁcient for
trimer formation (Supplementary Fig. S4). Collectively, these results
suggest that msDNA mediates the trimer formation of the Eco2
complex, while the RT-Toprim protein alone exists as a monomer.
Retron-Eco2 RT domain forms extensive interactions
with msDNA
As mentioned above, the base of the Eco2 trimer complex is a
trimeric, triangular assembly of three RT domains and three msDNA
molecules. The msrRNA portion of msDNA adopts an RSLﬂanked by
5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails. The RSL is sandwiched between RT
A
and RTB domains, with the 5’-end binding RTA and the 3’-end
binding RTB, respectively. This arrangement createsﬁve extensive
interfaces for RT‒msDNA interaction (Supplementary Fig. S5a). The
5’-end single-stranded tail primarily contacts the RT A palm
subdomain through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions
(Supplementary Fig. S5b). Notably, the rG15, which is crucial for
reverse transcription initiation, forms hydrogen bonds with R184. The
RSL region makes extensive contacts with the RT
A palm subdomain,
as well as with Q329/R264 in RTA thumb subdomain and RTB thumb
subdomain (Supplementary Fig. S5c, d). Although the Eco2 RSL loop
sequence (rA30-rA31-rU32) differs from the loop in Eco1 (rU52-rU53-
rU54), they share a similar conformation. In Eco2, rA30 and rU32
(Eco1 counterparts rU52 and rU54)ﬂip outwards, while rA31 (Eco1
counterpart rU53) base-stacks with rG29 (Eco1 counterpart rG51) and
aromatic residue H281 (Eco1 counterpart H268). These suggest that
an aromatic residue (a conserved histidine) in the thumb subdomain
facilitates the stabilization of the msrRNA loop. The ssRb region in
the 3’-end tail is stabilized by interactions with residues F46 and R56
in theﬁngers subdomain, K245/R247/T249 in the palm subdomain,
and S253 in the thumb subdomain of RT
B (Supplementary Fig. S5e).
The DNA‒RNA duplex, closely aligned with the catalytic center
YADD, engages in extensive interactions within the palm and thumb
subdomains, stabilizing the catalytic pocket (Supplementary Fig. S5f).

post-catalytic state (Fig. 2c, d). Y199 in the YADD motif forms a
hydrogen bond network with the bases of dG65 and dC66 (which
pair with rG53), while K66 and R70 interact with the phosphate
backbone of msrRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5f). The last nucleotide,
dC67, is positioned near the RT catalytic residues D201 and D202
(Fig. 4a, b). Interestingly, rU51— poised as the next nucleotide to
be reverse-transcribed — is ﬂipped out and stabilized by π‒π
stacking with an aromatic residue F46 in theﬁngers subdomain
(Fig. 4b). Additionally, rA49 and rA50 stack with dC67 and rG52
(the template of dC67), respectively. Replacing F46 with alanine
compromised antiphage activity (Fig. 4c) and reduced msDNA
production in vivo (Fig. 4d, e), indicating that F46 is crucial for
msDNA synthesis and defense.
Sequence alignment of diverse retron RTs shows this aromatic
residue is highly conserved, often as a tyrosine (Fig.4f). Analysis of
Eco1 and Eco2 RTs structures reveals conserved YADD, NAXXH,
VTG motifs and a similar arrangement of key residues (Supple-
mentary Fig. S6a, b). In Eco1, the base of rU72 (Eco2 counterpart
rU51) ﬂips out and formsπ‒π stacking interactions with dA76 and
dG77 (Supplementary Fig. S6c). The Eco1 aromatic amino acid Y51
(Eco2 counterpart F46) forms a base-stacking interaction network
with dA76, rU72, and dG77. Further antiphage assays showed that
Y51A abolishes Eco1’s defense activity (Supplementary Fig. S6d).
Together, these ﬁndings underscore the conserved role of this
aromatic residue in msDNA synthesis and antiphage activity
across retron RTs.
Comparison of RT-msDNA complexes among retrons
The components of Eco2 differ signiﬁcantly from those of Eco1,
which belongs to the type II retron family, with a standalone
nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase-like (NDT) effector
9,10.I n
contrast, Eco2 integrates the RT and Toprim domains into a single
protein. The overall structure of the Eco2 RT domain is similar to
that of Eco1, with an RMSD of 3.3 Å over 288 residues.
Interestingly, while Eco2 msrRNA forms a 23-bp RSLﬂanked by
two single-stranded tails that bridge two RT domains, Eco1
msDNA adopts a roughlyﬁve-pointed star conﬁguration wrapping
around a standalone RT (Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Several
structural differences in the RT domains may explain their distinct
oligomeric states and msDNA binding modes. For instance, the
Eco2 α1 andα2 helices are antiparallel, whereas they are parallel in
Eco1. In Eco1 the α1 helix mediates the dimer interface, tilting
outward by ~13° compared to the Eco2α1 helix (Supplementary
Fig. S7c). Another difference is an insertedβ sheet (β-sheet1) in
the Eco2 palm domain that could hinder msrRNA binding if it
adopted an Eco1-like conformation (Supplementary Fig. S7d, e).
Additionally, Eco1 msrRNA has an extra RSL region absent in Eco2,
potentially inﬂuencing whether the msrRNA encircles one RT or
bridges two (Supplementary Fig. S7b, e). Finally, Eco2’s thumb
domain features insertedβ-sheet2, and a long loop that engages
in mutual interactions among RT monomers in the trimer but do
not solely dictate trimer formation (Supplementary Fig. S7f, g).
Eco2 Toprim domain functions as an RNase to mediate
antiphage activity
Within the RT-Toprim fusion protein of Eco2, the C-terminal
Toprim-like effector domain features a central four-stranded
parallel β-sheet surrounded byα-helices (Fig. 5a, b). DALI analysis
shows that the effector domain is structurally similar to class 1/2
OLD nuclease Toprim domains, as well as to effectors from the
bacterial Gabija and PARIS antiphage defense systems
41,47,48,57
(Supplementary Fig. S8). The OLD nuclease Toprim domain
exhibits processive nuclease activity via a two-metal catalysis
mechanism57–61. Consistent with this model, the Eco2 Toprim
domain possesses a complete active site comprising an invariant
glutamate, an invariant glycine, and a conserved DxD motif

(Fig. 5b). Structural and sequence comparison of the Eco2 Toprim
domain with the class 2 OLD nuclease (PDB: 6NK8) reveals
conservation of residues E374/D460/D462 (DxD motif) coordinat-
ing metal A, D378/S513/E515 coordinating metal B, and the
catalytic lysine K562 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Alanine substitutions
in these residues abolished the antiphage activity of Eco2,
indicating that Toprim enzymatic activity is crucial for its defense
function (Fig. 5c).
To investigate the enzymatic activity of the Eco2 Toprim domain,
we ﬁrst assessed its potential host toxicity using RT-Toprim fusion
protein and truncated Toprim domain constructs. Expression of the
Toprim domain truncations (residues N267‒S586, S300‒S586, and
N337‒S586) in E. coli resulted in pronounced growth inhibition,
while the full-length RT-Toprim fusion protein exhibited no toxicity
in spot growth assays (Fig.5d). These results suggest that Toprim
enzymatic activity is detrimental to the host and may contribute to
Eco2-mediated antiphage defense.
To directly evaluate its catalytic function, we puriﬁed the Toprim
domain truncation (residues N267‒S586) and assessed its activity
using the RNase Alert assay. The wild-type Toprim domain
displayed robust RNase activity, as evidenced by a time-
dependent increase in ﬂuorescence (Fig. 5e). In contrast, alanine
substitutions in the predicted catalytic residues (E374 and D378)
dramatically reduced RNase activity (Fig.5e), indicating that the
observed cleavage is speciﬁc and dependent on an intact active
site.
We next performed RNA-seq analysis to determine the
functional consequences of Eco2 activation during phage infec-
tion. Compared to the empty-vector control, Eco2-expressing cells
displayed a marked downregulation of late phage genes and
increased reads for early and middle genes at 15 min and 30 min
post-infection (Fig. 5f). As successful progression to late gene
expression depends on effective translation of earlier gene
products, these data support a model in which Eco2 activation
disrupts phage protein synthesis, likely via RNA degradation
mediated by the Toprim domain.
Collectively, these ﬁndings reveal that the Retron-Eco2 Toprim
domain functions as an RNase, and that this activity underlies its
toxicity and Retron-Eco2’s antiphage function.
Phage-encoded endonuclease IV-like protein DenB triggers
Retron-Eco2 activation
The Toprim domain extends from the RT thumb subdomain and
helps stabilize the DNA‒RNA duplex (Supplementary Fig. S10a).
We also used AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of the isolated
RT-Toprim protein. The model revealed a“closed” conformation
compared to the more open arrangement observed by cryo-EM
(Supplementary Fig. S10b, c). Within the resolved region of the
protein, basic residues K383, H387, K418, R555, and K557 in the
Toprim domain interact with the phosphate backbone of the RNA
segment of the duplex (Supplementary Fig. S10d). To elucidate
the functional state of Eco2, we superimposed its Toprim domain
on that of DNA-bound GajA, a known active conﬁguration of the
Gabija defense system
41. The key catalytic residues of Eco2 are
aligned, yet we detect no Ca2+ density at the active site (Fig.5b;
Supplementary Fig. S10e). Moreover, the density for much of the
msdDNA is absent, which could prevent substrate engagement
and thus impede Toprim catalysis (Fig. S10f, g). Together with the
observed RNase activity and toxicity of the isolated Toprim
domain (Fig.5d, e), theseﬁndings support a model in which Eco2
is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation and becomes
activated only upon phage infection, likely through interactions
with phage-derived factors.
To identify potential phage-encoded triggers of the Retron-
Eco2 system, we isolated and sequenced phage mutants that
evade the Eco2-mediated defense (escaper phages). Genome
sequencing of four escapers revealed mutations in the denB
gene, all featuring a thymine (dT) insertion betweendenB dT192
and dG193. This insertion results in a frameshift and the
introduction of a premature stop codon (Fig. 6a). AlphaFold2-
based predictions indicate that denB encodes an endonuclease
IV-like protein that cleaves single-stranded DNA in a dC-speciﬁc
manner
62,63 (Fig. 6b). Sequence and structural alignments
revealed that the DenB protein possesses a conserved ‘PD_D/
ExK’ catalytic motif (Fig. 6c, d). The toxicity of DenB protein
prevented direct assays to con ﬁrm its activation role. None-
theless, the recurring denB mutations in escapers strongly
suggest that the denB gene is integral to triggering Eco2
activation and that mutations disrupting its expression enable
phages to circumvent this defense mechanism.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that Retron-Eco2 assembles into a
supramolecular trimeric complex with a distinctive triangular
quaternary architecture, distinct from previously reported retron-
effector complexes
12,34,35,64 (Fig. 1). Within this trimeric assembly,
each msrRNA strand of msDNA bridges two RT-Toprim monomers.
Notably, the formation of a speciﬁc RSL region in msrRNA appears
critical for mediating these interactions (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Functionally, we show that the Toprim domain of Eco2 exhibits
RNase activity, providing a mechanistic basis for its role in
antiphage defense. Furthermore, we identi ﬁed the phage-
encoded DenB protein as a potential trigger of Eco2 activation.
Together, these ﬁndings reveal a new structural principle under-
lying Retron-Eco2-mediated defense and highlight how diverse
retron systems may adopt distinct conformations to combat
phage invasion.
A central feature of Eco2 is the Toprim effector domain, which
shares a conserved core fold with other bacterial immune
effectors
39,41–44,47,48,65–67 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The functional
diversiﬁcation of Toprim domains in bacterial immunity under-
scores the evolutionary plasticity of this fold7,60,61. For instance,
Gabija cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), Wadjet (JET) targets
plasmid DNA, and PARIS disrupts host tRNALys to stall transla-
tion38,42,47. Our biochemical assays and RNA-seq analysis suggest
that the Eco2 Toprim domain functions as an RNase upon
activation, targeting and degrading RNA to arrest phage devel-
opment prior to the late stages of infection (Fig.5). Our data, as
well as another study
65, further implicate the phage-encoded
endonuclease IV-like protein DenB as a trigger for Retron-Eco2
activation. We propose that, under normal conditions, theﬂexible
msdDNA region occludes the Toprim active site (Supplementary
Fig. S10f, g), maintaining the complex in an autoinhibited
conformation (Fig. 6e). During phage infection, DenB likely
degrades the msdDNA scaffold, thereby relieving steric hindrance
and enabling the Toprim domain to access and cleave RNA
substrates, ultimately blocking phage replication (Fig.6e).
From a biotechnology standpoint, retrons offer unique advan-
tages because they naturally generate multiple copies of single-
stranded DNA. This property has been harnessed for donor DNA
production in genome editing applications across diverse organ-
isms
21,23,25,26,30,68–76. Our work provides theﬁrst detailed blueprint
for Eco2’s trimeric assembly, setting the stage for structure-guided
optimization of retron-based editing tools and novel phage
therapies. As these genome engineering approaches grow in
scope and sophistication, reﬁning our structural and mechanistic
understanding of retrons like Eco2 will be essential for advancing
their design.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and phage strains
Escherichia colistrains [MG1655, DH5α, and BL21(DE3)] were cultured in LB
or on LB agar at 37 °C with shaking at 210 rpm, unless otherwise stated. To
maintain plasmid stability, the media were supplemented with ampicillin

(100 μg/mL), kanamycin (50μg/mL), or chloromycetin (25μg/mL), depend-
ing on the resistance conferred by the plasmids. Phage infections were
performed in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mM MnCl
2 and 5 mM
MgCl2 (MMB medium) at 37 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, 0.2 mM
isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used for induction.
Plasmid construction
The Retron-Eco2 genetic unit consists of a native promoter, ncRNA, and an
RT-Toprim fusion protein. The genes encoding for native promoter and
ncRNA, which are not codon-optimized, as well as the full-length RT-
Toprim protein, which is codon-optimized for expression inE. coli,w e r e
synthesized by General Biosystems (Anhui) Co., Ltd. For protein
expression, puriﬁcation, and structural studies, the ncRNA was introduced
into pBB75 vector (Novagen), while the coding sequence for RT-Toprim
protein was cloned under the control of a T7 promoter into the pET21b
vector, which includes a C-terminal 8× His tag (His8). For phage challenge
assays, the Retron-Eco2 genetic unit was assembled through gene splicing
via overlap extension PCR and subsequently subcloned into pACYC184
vectors. The mutant Eco2 genetic units were generated using the original
sequence as a template.
Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree of retron RTs was constructed using sequences from
Mestre et al.
10 and Bobonis et al.11 Sequences with an identity greater than
99% were eliminated using Mmseqs2 77 (v.13.45111). The multiple
sequence alignment employed to generate the tree was performed using
MUSCLE v.5.178 with the super5 model, followed by trimming with trimAL
v.1.5.079 using the automated1 option. Finally, the retron RTs tree was

Expression and puriﬁcation of Retron-Eco2
For the protein expression of the Retron-Eco2 complex and its mutants, the
pET21b-rrt-toprim-His8 and pBB75-ncRNA constructs were co-transformed
into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain, plated on LB agar plates, and grown
overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was inoculated into 10 mL of LB
medium supplemented with 100μg/mL ampicillin and 50μg/mL kanamy-
cin as starter culture, and grown at 37 °C with shaking overnight. The
10 mL starter culture was then added to 1 L of LB medium (supplemented
with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin) and incubated at
37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until reaching an OD600 of 1.0. The cultures
were subjected to cold shock at 16 °C for 30 min and then induced with
200 μM IPTG. Following induction, the cultures were incubated for a further
16 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis Buffer containing 25 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and subsequently lysed using a pressure
homogenizer at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at
20,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a column
containing Ni
2+ afﬁnity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen), and the protein complex
was eluted using buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole). The
eluate was applied to a Source15Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted
using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 M in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 2 mM
1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT). The fractions corresponding to a conductivity of
approximately 35 mS/cm were concentrated to 1 mL and subsequently
puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superose6 10/300, GE Health-
care) in buffer SD (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT).
The RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein, the Toprim domain (N267-S586) and
corresponding mutants were expressed from pET21b plasmid in theE. coli
BL21(DE3) strain. With the exception of the addition of 100 μg/mL
ampicillin during cell culture, all other conditions were consistent with
those mentioned previously. For protein puri ﬁcation, cell pellets were
resuspended in high-salt lysis Buffer 2 (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM
NaCl), followed by cell lysis and centrifugation to remove cell debris. The
supernatant was incubated with Ni
2+ afﬁnity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) that
had been pre-equilibrated with Lysis Buffer. The target protein was eluted
by Lysis Buffer 2 supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The eluted sample
was applied to a Heparin column (GE Healthcare) and subjected to an
increasing gradient NaCl elution from 500 mM to 2 M NaCl in 25 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 8.0 and 2 mM DTT. The fractions containing the target protein were
concentrated to 1 mL. The RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein was further puriﬁed
by gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superose6 10/300, GE Healthcare) in
buffer SD (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl) supplemented with 5 mM
DTT, while the Toprim domain (N267-S586) and its mutants further puriﬁed
by gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300, GE Healthcare)
with the same buffer as the RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein.
For the Retron-Eco2 complex and RT-Toprim apo protein, UV absorbance
values were measured at 260 nm and 280 nm. Theﬁnal puriﬁed proteins
were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
8% -urea-PAGE gel.
Cryo-EM grid preparation and data acquisition
4 µL aliquots of the freshly puriﬁed Retron-Eco2 complex at an approximate
concentration of 1.0 mg/mL were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil Au
R1.2/1.3 (300 mesh). The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane after
blotting for 4.5 s at 100% humidity and 8 °C using a Vitrobot (Mark IV,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The cryo-grids were then transferred to 300 kV
Titan Krios electron microscopes (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a GIF
Quantum energyﬁlter (slit width 20 eV) and a Gatan K3 Summit detector.
Each image was automatically collected using the EPU software (version 2.9,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at a magniﬁcation of 81,000×, resulting in a pixel
size of 1.07 Å/pix. Each micrograph stack, containing 32 frames, was
exposed for 3.5 s. The defocus range was between‒1.2 and‒2.2 μm with an
accumulated total dose of 50 e
‒/Å2 and determined by Gctf.
Cryo-EM data processing
A diagram illustrating the procedures for data processing is presented in
Supplementary Fig. S2. A total of 5092 movie stacks were motion-corrected
using MotionCor2, and the resulting micrographs were subjected to Patch
CTF estimation and correction in cryoSPARC
81. After manual inspection
and curation, 4098 micrographs were selected for further processing.
Particles were automatically picked using blob-picker in combination with
Topaz, and 3,108,650 particles were extracted with a box size of 240 pixels,
followed by Fourier cropping to 60 pixels. Subsequent 2D classiﬁcation was
performed, and 41,623 particles with distinct features were selected for ab
initio model generation, resulting in the creation of 10 initial models,
including 1-class, 3-class, and 6-class models. These models were used as
multi-references for 3D classiﬁcation. A total of 2,979,419 particles were
subjected to two rounds of 3D classi ﬁcation, yielding 1,307,521 high-
quality particles, which were re-extracted with a box size of 240 pixels and
subjected to a third round of 3D classiﬁcation. Finally, a subset of 574,158
particles was selected for 3D reﬁnement, resulting in a cryo-EM map with
an overall resolution of 2.6 Å based on gold-standard Fourier shell
correlation (FSC)
82.
Model building and reﬁnement
For the atomic model of the Retron-Eco2, the Alphafold2 predicted
structure wasﬁtted into the cryo-EM density map using the“ﬁt in the map”
function in UCSF ChimeraX83. The initialﬁtted model was further reﬁned
through manual adjustments in COOT v0.8.9.184. The resulting protein
model was subjected to a rigidﬁt into the the entire cryo-EM density map
via the phenix.dock_in_map function of the PHENIX v1.21 software suite85.
Model quality was assessed using the Molprobity scores 86. Finally,
structural ﬁgures were generated via ChimeraX (v.1.2.5).
Plaquing assays
Plaque assays were performed as previously described3,9,87.I nb r i e f ,E. coli
MG1655 containing the retron system or the pACYC184 empty vector was
cultured. Bacterial lawns were prepared by mixing 200μLo fo v e r n i g h t
cultures with 7 mL of molten top agar supplemented with 25 μg/mL
chloromycetin, which was then poured onto LB agar plates. Tenfold serial
dilutions of a high-titre phage stock were spotted onto the top bacterial layer.
The plates were imaged after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The efﬁciency of
plating (EOP) was measured and compared between the plaque assay results
for control bacteria and those containing the defense system. The activity of
wild-type Retron-Eco2 system and its mutants were assessed by performing
EOP assays withEscherichiaphage vB_EcoM, while retron Eco1 system and its
mutants were infected with phage K42.
Isolation of escaper bacteriophages that overcome defense
To isolate mutant bacteriophages that escape the Retron-Eco2 defense
system, phages were plated on LB agar plates containing bacteria
expressing the wild-type Retron-Eco2 system using a double-layer plaque
assay
9,87. Overnight cultures ofE. coli MG1655 containing the Retron-Eco2
defense system were diluted 1:50 and grown at 37 °C with shaking for 1.5 h
until reaching an OD600 of 0.3. 200μL of the culture was mixed with 7 mL
of pre-melted 0.5% MMB agar containing chloromycetin and poured onto
agar plates. 2μL drops of tenfold serial diluted bacteriophage vB_EcoM
were spotted onto the bacterial top layer. The double-layer plates were
incubated overnight at 37 °C, and single plaques were picked into 90μLo f
phage buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM MgCl
2, 10 mM NaCl). The phage
solutions were mixed several times by vortexing to release the phages
from the agar into the phage buffer, and then centrifuged at 2000×g for
10 min to pellet debris. The supernatant containing the mutant phages
was sterile-ﬁltered and transferred into a new tube. The collected phages
were tested for their ability to infect both a control strain and a Retron-
Eco2 operon-carrying strain, and their phenotype was checked and
compared to that of the parental bacteriophage vB_EcoM through plaque
assays, as described above.
Ampliﬁcation of phages
Ampliﬁcation of phages was performed as previously described 9,87.
Parental bacteriophages were propagated in E. coli MG1655 containing
an empty vector, while escaper phages were more effectively propagated
on the Retron-Eco2 operon-carrying strain. TheEscherichia phage vB_EcoM
was propagated in a liquid culture of bacteria grown in MMB medium to
an OD600 of 0.3. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm,
the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000×g, and the supernatant was
ﬁltered through a 0.22μM ﬁlter to remove remaining bacterial cell debris.
The phage titer was determined using the plaquing assay.
msDNA isolation
msDNA isolation was performed as described previously9,11. Brieﬂy, 25 mL
cultures of E. coli MG1655 expressing wild-type Retron-Eco2 defense
system and its mutant from the native promoter were grown in LB

medium supplemented with chloromycetin at 37 °C with shaking at
200 rpm. Overnight cultures were centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min. The
supernatants were discarded, and the cell pellets were resuspended in
200 μL of Solution I (50 mM glucose, 10 mM EDTA and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0). Next, 200μL of Solution II (0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS) was added, and the
mixture was inverted gently ten times. Subsequently, 400μL of Solution III
(3 M potassium acetate, 2 M acetic acid) was added, and the samples were
mixed again by inverting the tubes ﬁve times. After centrifugation, the
supernatant was precipitated overnight at ‒80 °C with ethanol. The
precipitated nucleic acids were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C,
and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice with
1 mL of 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The
pellets were air-dried for 15–30 min at room temperature and resuspended
in 20μL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The puriﬁed nucleic
acids containing msDNA were treated with RNase A for 30 min at room
temperature. The samples were then incubated with loading buffer (90%
formamide, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% (w/v)
bromophenol blue 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol) at 100 °C for 5 min and
subjected to 12% denaturing Urea-PAGE using 1× Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer
(150 V, 1 h). The urea-PAGE gels were strained with 4S GelRed.
RNase alert assay
To detect the RNase activity of Toprim domain, we used RNase Alert kit
(APExBIO, Cat. No. K1902). The RNase Alert kit, based on the principle of
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), is capable of detecting
RNase activity with high sensitivity. We co-incubated the puriﬁed Toprim
domain with ssRNA provided in the kit at 37 °C and performed
ﬂuorescence detection using SpectraMax
® i3x, with an excitation
wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Culves
were analyzed and generated using GraphPad Prism v.8.0.2.
Detection of the phage genes expression using RNAseq
For each sample,E. coli MG1655 cells containing the Retron-Eco2 defense
system or the pACYC184 empty vector were grown in 10 mL of LB medium
at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until reaching an OD600 of 0.3. The
cultures were infected withEscherichia phage vB_EcoM at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 5. RNA was extracted from the cells using Bacterial Total
RNA Rapid Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech, Order NO. B518625) at 15 min
and 30 min post-infection, as previously described. Brie ﬂy, cells were
collected by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellets were
incubated with 100 μL of lysozyme (400 μg/mL) for 5 min at room
temperature. Next, 900μL of Buffer Rlysis-B was added, and the mixture
was vortexed immediately before incubated for 5 min at room tempera-
ture. Subsequently, 200μL of chloroform was added, and the tubes were
mixed. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
supernatant was precipitated with one-third volume of ethanol for 3 min at
room temperature and then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
pellets were washed twice with 750μL of 75% ethanol, centrifuged again
at 14,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, air-dried for 10 min, resuspended in
30–50 μL of DEPC-treated ddH
2O, and stored at–80 °C. All the experiments
were performed with two biological replicates. The extracted RNA was sent
to Seqhealth Technology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China) for subsequent cDNA
library preparation, and high-throughput sequencing using Illumina
sequencing platform (Novaseq 6000). Differentially expressed genes were
identiﬁed using EdgeR based on pairwise comparison (the criteria BH-
adjusted P < 0.05 and |log2 Fold Change | > 1).
