Canonical CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique has profoundly impacted theﬁelds of
plant biology, biotechnology, and crop improvement. Since non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) is usually considered to generate random indels, its high efﬁciency mutation is
generally not pertinent to precise edit ing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) can
mediate precise editing with supplied d onor DNA, but it suffers from extreme low
efﬁciency in higher plants. Therefore, precision editing in plants will be facilitated by
the ability to predict NHEJ repair outcome and to improve HDR efﬁciency. Here, we
report that NHEJ-mediated single nucleotide insertion at different rice genes is
predictable based on DNA sequences at the target loci. Three mutation prediction
tools (inDelphi, FORECasT, and SPROUT) have been validated in the rice plant
system. We also evaluated the chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) and Cas9-Retron
precISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY) strategies to facilitate donor
template supply for improving HDR ef ﬁciency in Nicotiana benthamiana and rice.
However, neither cgRNA nor CRISPEY improved plant HDR editing efﬁciency in this study.
Interestingly, our data indicate that tethering of 200–250 nucleotides long sequence to either
5′ or 3′ ends of guide RNA did not signiﬁcantly affect Cas9 cleavage activity.

INTRODUCTION
Crop improvement greatly relies on exploiting existing- and creating new-genetic variations.
Conventional CRISPR-Cas tools have greatly facilitated the generation of targeted genetic
variations in plants by producing random indels through the non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) repair pathway (Xie and Yang, 2013; Molla et al., 2020a). Base editing, an emerging
technology, can precisely install four transition and two transversion point mutations (Molla and
Yang, 2019; Molla and Yang, 2020a; Molla et al., 2020b; Molla et al., 2020c). However, neither
CRISPR-Cas nor base editing can generate precise indels, which are also important for plant trait
improvement. To generate precise indels, we mainly depend on utilizing the homology-directed
repair (HDR) pathway. Unfortunately, HDR is template-directed and inef ﬁcient, limiting its
application in crop improvement. Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) in DNA is repaired
predominantly through the NHEJ pathway in higher plants. Therefore, unlike HDR, NHEJ-mediated
mutagenesis is highly efﬁcient in plants. If we could predict the DSB repair outcome, it would
facilitate generating precise indels.

BRIEF RESEARCH REPORT
published: 16 March 2022
doi: 10.3389/fgeed.2022.825236
Although Cas9 was believed to trigger random repair
outcomes, a growing body of evidence indicates that the
repair outcomes are non-random and depend on target
DNA sequence ( van Overbeek et al., 2016 ; Chakrabarti
et al., 2019 ; Taheri-Ghahfarokhi et al., 2018 ; Molla and
Yang, 2020b; Li et al., 2021). Large datasets were utilized to
develop models (inDelphi, FORECAST, SPROUT, and
CROTON) for predicting Cas9 repair outcome in
mammalian cells ( Shen et al., 2018 ; Allen et al., 2019 ;
Leenay et al., 2019; Molla and Yang, 2020b; Li et al., 2021).
Those computational tools predi ct repair outcomes, mainly
the frequency of 1 bp insertions and small deletions, with high
efﬁciency (Molla and Yang, 2020b). Although the models have
been developed exploiting Cas9 repair data from mammalian
cells, we hypothesize that they could also be used to predict
repair outcomes in plant cells since the mutations largely
depend on the local DNA sequence near the DSB ( Molla
and Yang, 2020b ). However, no single study reports Cas9
repair outcome prediction in plants or validates those
predictor models in plants.
HDR is highly valuable in precise gene replacements,
knock-in, and installing complex modi ﬁcations. However,
achieving a decent ef ﬁciency in higher plants is a major
hurdle to using HDR regularly in crop improvements. For
HDR to be successful, adequate donor repair templates are
needed to be available near the DSB. Temporal and spatial
coordination between DSB crea tion and supplying adequate
donor templates are considered the major bottlenecks in HDR
(Li et al., 2018; Huang and Puchta, 2019). Several strategies
such as using geminivirus replicons ( Čermák et al., 2015 ),
chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) (Butt et al., 2017), chemically
modiﬁed donor DNA, tandem repeat HDR (TR-HDR) ( Lu
et al., 2020), and transcript-templated HDR (TT-HDR) ( Li
et al., 2019) have been used to overcome these bottlenecks. To
make the donor templates available onsite of DSB, one
attractive approach is to fuse them with the guide RNA
(gRNA) sequence. For example, the use of chimeric guide
RNA (cgRNA) molecule, containing gRNA fused with donor
template, has been demonstrated to induce HDR in rice (Butt
et al., 2017). cgRNA strategy was based on donor template
fusion at the 3’end of sgRNA and RNA-templated DNA repair
(Butt et al., 2017 ). Recently, an interesting strategy, Cas9-
Retron precISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY),
described the utilization of bacterial retron to produce
single-stranded donor DNA that is tethered with sgRNA
(Sharon et al., 2018). CRISPEY strategy has been shown to
improve HDR efﬁciency up to 96% in yeast (Sharon et al.,
2018). In human cells, CRISPEY achieved HDR rates of up to
11.3% (Kong et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). However, there is
no report of plant HDR improvement utilizing a bacterial
retron system.
In this study, we explored to achieve HDR-mediated editing
using cgRNA and CRISPEY strategies in tobacco and rice for six
different target genes. We also investigated predicting Cas9 repair
outcome in plants utilizing the predictor models generated for
mammalian systems. The ﬁndings could be helpful for precise
genome editing in plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vector Construction
We have designed modiﬁed versions of the CRISPEY construct
described earlier (Sharon et al., 2018). For GFP to BFP conversion
in Nicotiana benthamiana, we fused tobacco codon optimized
E. coli Ec86-reverse transcriptase (Ec86-RT) with P2A-Cas9 for
co-translational expression ofboth Ec86-RT and Cas9 by CaMV35S
promoter. P2A is a self-cleaving peptide. A chimeric RNA of Ec86
retron sequence with a gRNA was expressed by AtU6 promoter. It
was designed in such a way that a portion of retron sequence was
replaced with a donor template sequence harboring the mutations
necessary for GFP to BFP conversion (Supplementary Table S1and
Supplementary Sequence).
For rice, we ﬁrst constructed a basic vector pK-CRISPEY,
which contains three distinct cassettes. The ﬁrst one is a rice
codon-optimized Ec86-RT expression cassette. Ec86-RT was
driven by OsUbi10 promoter and terminated with
Agrobacterium gene seven terminator. The second one was
to express a chimeric RNA of Ec86 retron sequence with a
gRNA. A portion of retron sequence was replaced with speciﬁc
donor template sequences. This cassette was driven by CaMV
35S promoter and terminated by Arabidopsis HSP terminator.
The 5′ and 3′ end of the chimeric retron-guide sequence was
ﬂanked by the hammerhead (HH) ribozyme and the hepatitis
delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, respectively. Two Aar1 sites were
incorporated upstream of the gRNA scaffold sequence for easy
cloning of donor template plus protospacer sequence. The
donor template was at the 5’ end of the protospacer. The third
cassette was to express SpCas9. We synthesized the ﬁrst two
cassettes and cloned them at the HindIII/BsaI sites of
pRGEB32 vector replacing 402 bp to construct pK-
CRISPEY. The original hygromycin phosphotransferase
(HPT) gene cassette of pRGEB32 was intact ( Xie et al.,
2015). We separately synthesized donor plus protospacer
for each of the three targets, OsALS, OsCC, and OsActin,
and cloned at the AarI sites of pK-CRISPEY. Three vectors
were named as pK-CRISPEY-ALS, pK-CRISPEY-CC, and pK-
CRISPEY-Actin ( Supplementary Table S1 and
Supplementary Sequence ).
For the cgRNA approach, a polycistronic-tRNA-gRNA (PTG)
multiplexing cassette was designed to repair three targets
simultaneously (Xie et al., 2015). It comprises three gRNAs,
OsALS, OsPita , and OsPtr, each with their speci ﬁc repair
template at the 3′ ends of the scaffolds.ALS and Pita required
only a few base pairs modiﬁcation, so the repair template was
designed with 100 bp homology ﬂanks from the DSB
(Supplementary Table S1 ). Since the Ptr needed a 12 bp
deletion and various base-pair changes over a larger region, we
used 125 bp homology arms. Synonymous mutations were
introduced in repair templates to prevent Cas9 from re-cutting
after successful HDR repair. The PTG fragment with repair
templates was synthesized (GenScript, NJ, United States) and
then cloned downstream of the OsU3 promoter into the binary
vector pRGEB32 using the compatible overhangs generated by
BsaI digestion. Guide RNAs with repair templates fused at their 3’
ends are termed as chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) following an

earlier report (Butt et al., 2017). This new construct is termed
pCgAPP (Supplementary Sequence).
pK-CRISPEY-ALS, pK-CRISPEY-CC, pK-CRISPEY-Actin,
and pCgAPP were introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens
strain EHA105 via electroporation for subsequent
agroinﬁltration and/or stable transformation in tobacco and rice.
Agroinﬁltration and Generation of Stable
Transgenics inNicotiana benthamiana
Nicotiana benthamiana 16c, a transgenic line highly expressing
mGFP, was used in this study (Ruiz et al., 1998). 16c line was a
generous gift from Prof. David Baulcombe (United Kingdom).
Agroinﬁltration was performed using four to 6 week old plants
grown at 25
°C and 75% humidity (75%) under the 16 h light
(100 µmol photons m−2 s−1) according to a previously described
protocol with few modiﬁcations (Yang et al., 2000). Brieﬂy, MMA
solution (10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, 150μM acetosyringone)
was used as inﬁltration solution to resuspendAgrobacterium cells
(EHA105) to an OD600 = 1. The abaxial leaf regions to be
inﬁltrated were punctured with a small needle. A 1-ml syringe
(without needle) was used to inﬁltrate Agrobacterium suspension.
To develop stable transgenic plants, fully expanded fresh
leaves were collected and sterilized by immersing in 70%
ethanol for 60 s, washing in 7.5% bleach plus one drop
Tween-20 solution for 20 min, and repeatedly washing in
sterile distilled water. Round leaf discs were prepared by
pressing a cork borer against an N. benthamiana leaf on a
Petri dish base. Leaf discs were incubated in Agrobacterium
suspension (OD
600 = 1, 100 µM acetosyringone) for 30 min.
The discs were blot dried and incubated in cocultivation media
(4.3 g/L MS salts, 30 g/L sucrose, 1 mg/L 6-
benzylaminopurine, 0.1 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, and
100 μM Acetosyringone) for 2 days in the dark. Leaf discs were
washed for removing extra bacterial cells, blot dried, and
transferred to regeneration selection media (4.3 g/L MS
salts, 30 g/L sucrose, 1 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine, 0.1 mg/L
1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 400 mg/L Timentin, and 10 mg/L
hygromycin). The plates were incubated at 28
°C with an 18 h
light regime. Leaf discs were moved to fresh media plates every
14– 15 days. After 2 weeks of selection, callus tissue starts
appearing from the cut ends of the disk. Shoots growing
from the selected calli were dissected and placed in rooting
media (MS salts, 30 gm/L sucrose, 25 mg/L hygromycin) to
produce plantlets. Shoots were individually excised from the
calli once they reached a height of >3 m m .A f t e r2 w e e k si n
rooting media, roots were adequately developed. Plantlets with
well-developed roots were transferred to soil pot in
greenhouse.
Rice Transformation and Regeneration
Kitaake and Jupiter (Oryza sativasubsp. japonica) rice genotypes
was used for genetic transformation. Mature embryo-derived calli
were transformed with all four constructs using the
Agrobacterium-mediated method following an earlier described
protocol (Molla et al., 2020a). Brieﬂy, transformed calli were
selected in hygromycin (50 mg/L) containing media. Selected and
proliferating calli were either transferred to regeneration media or
collected for DNA isolation. Regenerated shoots were transferred
to rooting media. Well-rooted plantlets were transferred to soil
and grown in a greenhouse.
Microscopical Analysis
Segments of leaf tissue (1– 2 cm) were excised, and the pieces were
mounted in water on glass microscope slides with a coverslip. The
leaves were imaged using an Observer SD spinning disc confocal
microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Samples were visualized and
photographed using 405 nm (Blue) and 488 nm (Green)ﬁlters.
Genotyping of Editing Outcomes
For the three CRISPEY constructs, hygromycin-resistant calli
were used for DNA isolation after two rounds of selection.
Isolated DNAs from calli samples were used to amplify the
target regions. PCR products were pooled and subjected to
deep amplicon sequencing by using Genewiz amplicon EZ
sequencing service (Genewiz, United States). After adapter
ligation and library preparation, the samples were sequenced
using a 2 × 250 paired-end conﬁguration. Image analysis and
base calling were conducted bythe Illumina Control Software
on the Illumina instrument. Raw sequence data were
demultiplexed using bcl2fastq version 2.17.1.14. Read pairs
were trimmed for adapter sequences and low-quality basecalls
using Trimmomatic version 0.36. Each read pair was then
merged using the bbmerge tool from the BBtools software
toolkit. The target sequence between conserved ﬂanking
primers was extracted from each merged pair. For each
sample, one excel ﬁle was generated to contain the unique
nucleotide sequences and their abundances, and one excelﬁle
was generated to contain the unique amino acid sequences and
their abundance for each sample. The QIIME data analysis
package was used to generate OTU sequences. OTU clusters
are deﬁned by a 97% identity threshold.
We also regenerated plants (Jupiter variety) for pCgAPP
construct. Total DNA was isolated from leaf samples collected
from each individual plant following an earlier described protocol
(Molla et al., 2020c). Target regions ofALS, Pita, andPtr loci were
ampliﬁed by PCR using speciﬁc pair of primers. Puriﬁed PCR
products were sequenced and decoded using TIDE for editing
outcomes ( Brinkman et al., 2014 ). All primers used for
genotyping are listed inSupplementary Table S1.
Prediction of NHEJ Outcome
We employed three models, inDelphi, FORECast and
SPROUT, for predicting NHEJ mutation outcome ( Molla
and Yang, 2020b ). The inDelphi is available with the link:
https://indelphi.giffordlab. mit.edu/. Protospacer with 50 bp
ﬂanking sequence on each side was provided as input in the
inDelphi user interface. FORECasT was accessed with the link:
https://partslab.sanger.ac.uk/FORECasT, while SPROUT was
accessible by following the link: https://zou-group.github.io/
SPROUT. For FORECasT, around 40 – 50 bp target genomic
sequence, including protospacer, is required. SPROUT
requires 20 bp protospacer plus 3 bp PAM sequence for
prediction. The prediction outputs from each model were

compared with the observed data from deep sequencing (ALS,
CC, and Actin targets) and Sanger sequencing ( Pita target).
The data from retron and cgRNA experiments were reanalyzed
for NHEJ outcomes. We have considered the single base pair
insertion and different deletion types and their frequency in
our analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analysed using Graphpad prism nine software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, United States). One-way
analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Dunnett ’s multiple
comparisons test were used to compare the differences
between different groups.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Utilizing Retron for HDR inNicotiana
benthamiana and Rice
Retrons are prokaryotic retroelements that can produce
multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). Bacterial retrons
have recently been shown to function in antiphage defense
(Millman et al., 2020). Retron Ec86, from E. coli, contains a
cassette that encodes a unique RNA (msd-msr) and a reverse
transcriptase (Ec86-RT) ( Inouye et al., 1999 ). Ec86-RT can
reverse transcribe the msd portion into single-stranded DNA
that remains tethered to its template RNA (Inouye et al., 1999). By
altering a part of msd-msr sequence, single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) containing desired mutations ﬂanked by homology
to a targeted genomic region could be produced in vivo .
Retron-derived ssDNA has been demonstrated to facilitate
template-mediated genome editing in yeast ( Sharon et al.,
2018; Gallagher et al., 2020), mammalian cells (Kong et al.,
2021; Zhao et al., 2021), and bacteria (Schubert et al., 2021).
We fused the retron seq (msd-msr altered with donor sequence of
interest) at the 5′ end of the gRNA to generate a chimeric
transcript. After reverse transcription by Ec86RT, the donor
ssDNA template would be tethered to the transcript and be
available near the DSB for template-dependent repair.
Envisaging retron could be harnessed for HDR-editing in
plant cells, we set out to validateﬁrst in a GFP expressingN.
benthamiana 16c line. To test if retron can promote HDR, we
used a reporter system that results in GFP to BFP conversion. We
designed a binary construct to express Cas9, Ec86RT, and retron
sequence harboring information to produce donor ssDNA
templates ( Figure 1A ). We introduced a single nucleotide
change (
TAT > CAT) for mGFP to BFP conversion (Tyr >
His) and an additional three synonymous mutations in the
protospacer seed region to prevent re-cutting the donor
template by Cas9. We could not detect blueﬂuorescence when
we analyzed leaf samples by confocal microscopy after several
rounds of agroinﬁltration. Similar results were obtained for
samples collected after 3, 7, and 10 days of in ﬁltration.
Assuming that transient expression might not be sufﬁcient to
induce HDR, we performed leaf disc transformation with the
construct and regenerated >50 stably transformed plants
(Supplementary Figures S1A,B ). Plants were analyzed for
change in ﬂuorescence from green to blue. We could notﬁnd
a single plant with alteredﬂuorescence (Supplementary Figure
S1C). Sanger sequencing of 30 randomly chosen plants also did
not reveal successful editing. We reasoned that the failure might
be due to the inef ﬁciency of the guide RNA used for the
experiment. The guide RNA contains 5′-CTTA-3′ immediately
adjacent to PAM sequence (Supplementary Figure 1D). The 5′-
CTTA-3′ motif has been shown to be inefﬁcient in genome
editing in an earlier systematic study (Graf et al., 2019).
Then we attempted to test the same strategy in rice by
targeting three genes, OsALS (OsKitaake02g183100), OsCC
(OsKitaake05g165200), and OsActin (OsKitaake03g316400),
separately (Figure 1B). For ALS, one nucleotide change (T
GG
> TTG) causing W > L for herbicide tolerance and another
nucleotide change for PAM destruction were included in the
donor template. We attempted to knock-in a 12 bp sequence
harboring EcoRI and HindIII recognition sites inCC target and
6 bp EcoRI recognition sequence inActin target. Three constructs
were independently transformed to rice calli via the
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. After two consecutive
selections in hygromycin, proliferating calli were collected for
DNA isolation. For initial veriﬁcation, we ampliﬁed the ALS
target region and digested it with Mfe1 since successful editing
events should generate a recognition site for the enzyme. We
observed many samples exhibited Mfe1 positive results. It should
be noted here that Mfe1 could also be generated if there is a single
T insertion (NHEJ) at the cut point. Then, we sequenced
randomly chosen 12 samples and analyzed them using
Synthego ICE tool. Excitingly, the ICE analysis revealed a
knock-in efﬁciency of up to 23% in the tested calli for theALS
target (Supplementary Figure S2).
For further validating the result and obtaining a clear idea of
editing efﬁciency, we performed amplicon deep sequencing. For
each construct, DNA was isolated from 30 independent calli
samples. We ampliﬁed target regions using PCR and pooled 10
samples into one for deep amplicon sequencing. On an average,
we obtained >50 K reads for each sample. Strikingly, results
revealed no HDR events occurred in the case of ALS and
Actin targets. This observation indicated that, for one or two
nucleotide replacements, as in the case ofALS, the ICE tool is not
highly sensitive and may mislead on the editing output. Amplicon
deep sequence is recommended to get a clear picture of the editing
events. However, for theCC target, we observed only one read
with a perfect 12 bp knock-in. We have observed high NHEJ
efﬁciency in all three cases. Overall, retron-mediated template
editing has not been successful in tobacco and rice. Around 16
bacterial retron systems have been experimentally validated and
have their fully annotated components available in the public
database (Simon et al., 2019). Recently, modiﬁcations in the
retron non-coding RNA that increases production of reverse
transcribed DNA have been identi ﬁed (Lopez et al., 2021 ).
Systematic studies are required toﬁnd suitable retron systems
for plant genome editing.
Chimeric gRNA Approach for HDR in Rice
Another approach to make the repair template available at the
vicinity of DSB is to fuse the template sequence with gRNA
sequence. After successful transcription, a chimeric guide RNA
(cgRNA) would be produced containing gRNA for Cas9-
mediated targeted DSB generation and RNA repair template
for HDR editing (Figure 1C). An earlier study demonstrated
2.14% HDR efﬁciency of cgRNA approach in regenerated rice
plants (Butt et al., 2017). Similarly, Cas12a mediated DSB coupled
with RNA donor template was reported to achieve successful
HDR in rice (Li et al., 2019). Encouraged by these studies, we
tested the strategy at three rice loci, ALS, Pita, and Ptr. The
pCgAPP construct was transformed in rice calli and 196
hygromycin resistant T
0 rice lines were obtained through
regeneration. For the ALS and Pita targets, successful HDR
event would generate the recognition sites for MfeI and NcoI,
Frontiers in Genome Editing | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 8252365
Molla et al. Predictable NHEJ Insertion in Plants
respectively. To screen successful HDR events at thePtr locus,
PCR positive/negative assay was employed by using one primer
for the genomic region outside the homology included in repair
template and a primer for the region over the deleted 12 bp
polymorphism only found in the repair template
(Supplementary Figure S3A). For ALS target, 25 out of the
196 lines indicated success of the MfeI site generation
(Figure 2A). However, no NcoI positive lines were generated
for Pita and no ampliﬁcation was observed forPtr. These results
indicated unsuccessful HDR events atPita and Ptr loci.
To further investigate editing outcomes, the lines in which
successful MfeI sites generated were sequenced for all three target
loci. Sanger chromatograms were decoded, aligned and compared
to the WT and the repair template to analyze editing outcomes
(Figures 2B,C). While forALS there were many positive MfeI
digestion results, sequencing revealed these occurred by single-T
insertions (NHEJ indel) and not by HDR. If HDR created the
desired changes, no indel should be observed, and all the
substitutions from the repair template would be included. It is
also interesting that some alleles contain a correct substitution but
at one side of the DSB point, suggesting one-sided HDR events
(Supplementary Figure S3B). Overall, we observed 12% (3/26) of
the alleles to have a possible one-sided HDR inALS by evidence of
base substitution. For thePita gene, randomly chosen 17 lines
were sequenced. We observed 76% of the lines with indels. We
could not detect any instances of HDR inPita locus. Lastly, we
sequenced Ptr locus in 20 random lines and have not found any
evidence of editing either by NHEJ or HDR. ThePtr protospacer
contained a GCC motif in theﬁrst four nucleotides proximal to
PAM, which was reported to be inefﬁcient in cleaving by Cas9
(Graf et al., 2019). Based on the results we obtained for the three
loci in rice, it seems cgRNA approach is not efﬁcient in mediating
HDR editing.
Prediction of NHEJ-Mediated Precise
Insertion in Rice Genes
Cas9 induced DSB generation and subsequent NHEJ-mediated
genome editing is highly efﬁcient in plants. The NHEJ repair
outcome is considered random and, therefore, not useful in
precise genome editing applications. However, several recent
studies in animal systems showed that the Cas9-mediated
editing outcome is reproducible and predictable depending on
the features of target DNA sequences (Molla and Yang, 2020b).
The ability to predict the spectrum of DSB repair outcomes would
facilitate us in performing more efﬁcient gene knock-out and
precision genome editing applications without HDR. Using the
DSB repair products of thousands of target DNA loci in
mammalian cells, several machine learning models have been
generated to predict the spectrum of CRISPR-Cas9 editing
products (Shen et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2019; Leenay et al.,
2019; Li et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, no study has

Molla et al. Predictable NHEJ Insertion in Plants
reported predictability of Cas9-induced DSB repair outcome in
plants. Therefore, we set out to analyze our dataset to examine if
the same prediction rules are applicable in plants and if the
existing machine learning models could be applicable to foresee
the Cas9-induced mutation outcome in plants.
The editing outcome that could be most reliably predicted is
single nucleotide insertion (Molla and Yang, 2020b). Earlier studies
reported that the inserted nucleotide is identical to the nucleotide at
– 4f r o mt h eP A Ms e q u e n c e(Chakrabarti et al., 2019; Lemos et al.,
2018). Therefore, if a T nucleotide is present at – 4o ft h e
protospacer sequence, another T nucleotide is highly likely to
be inserted ( Chakrabarti et al., 2019 ). However, the
predictability decreases in the order T > A > C > Ga t – 4
position ( Molla and Yang, 2020b ). For a preliminary
investigation, we have carefully chosen three protospacers, for
targeting ALS, Pita and Ptr,h a v i n gaTa t – 4p o s i t i o n
(Figure 3A). The inDelphi model predicted single T insertion
for 13.9% of all products in theALS target locus (Figure 3B;
Supplementary Figure S4). Interestingly, we observed 25 lines
(12.75%) showed positive Mfe1 digestion out of 196 plants tested
from our cgRNA experiment, indicating a single T insertion at the
cut point. Sanger sequencing of those lines validated the result
(Figure 2B). Similarly, deep sequencing data from our retron
experiment showed an average of 21.13% single T insertion
with the sameALS guide (Figure 3B). The FORECasT has also
predicted single T insertion as the most dominant class of
mutations ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Although SPROUT
predicted 19% of the total reads with insertion, it failed to
accurately predict the most likely inserted base (Supplementary
Figure S4). For thePita guide, inDelphi and FORECasT computed
13.9% and 16% single T insertion, respectively (Supplementary
Figure S5). Our experimental data showed 18% of thePita alleles
were with a single T inserted. This time also, SPROUT was
inaccurate in predicting the inserted base.
FORECasT, SPROUT, and inDelphi predicted 13.2%, 12%,
and 8.6% 1 bp insertion in theOsCC target locus, respectively.
Our deep sequencing data showed 14.77% single C insertion
(Figure 3C). inDelphi and FORECasT accurately predicted a C
insertion (Supplementary Figure S6). For theOsActin target,
our result showed most abundant insertion type is single G
(13.76%) followed by single C (3.62%) ( Figure 3C ).
Surprisingly, inDelphi predicted the insertion types
accurately. SPROUT displayed that the most likely inserted
base is G (Supplementary Figure S7 ). However, FORECasT
was not able to predict the insertions.
The above result indicates thatt h em o d e l sa r ep r e t t yg o o d
in predicting the insertion types, especially 1 bp insertion and
their fraction in the plant system. We found that the inDelphi
outperformed the FORECasT and SPROUT in anticipating
the mutation outcome, especially the insertion class and
frequency. In contrast to the notion that the NHEJ
outcome is random, our data suggest that the Cas9-induced
double-strand break repair outcome is non-random and could
be predicted ( Molla and Yang, 2020b ). Single nucleotide
insertion is the most predictable class of repair genotype.
We found that the inserted nucleotide is identical to the
nucleotide at – 4 from the PAM sequence in accordance
with earlier studies in mammalian cells ( Allen et al., 2019;
Chakrabarti et al., 2019 ). The insertion of a single base
identical to – 4 nucleotide in the protospacer indicates the
occurrence of the following sequential events: Cas9-induced 5’
single-base overhang generation, ﬁlling in by DNA
polymerase, and ligation by ligase 4 ( Zuo and Liu, 2016 ;
Lemos et al., 2018 ; Molla and Yang, 2020b ). These events

logically explain the generation of 1 bp insertion identical to
the – 4 base in the noncomplementary strand since the base at
– 4a c t sa sat e m p l a t e(Figure 4A ). A recent study in
mammalian cells showed that the fraction of 1 bp insertion
relative to other repair genotypes can be increased by the
exogenous application of the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019
(Bermudez-Cabrera et al., 2021 ).
Prediction of Deletion and Base
Substitution
Unlike insertion, the models tested here performed poorly in
predicting the frequency and types of deletion and substitution
events. Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway
(also known as alternative-NHEJ) is often associated with

deletions events generated from Cas9-induced DSB repair. MMEJ
deletes intervening bases between short tracts of local matching
sequences (Her and Bunting, 2018 ) and, hence, the repair
outcome is predictable by analyzing microhomologous
sequences. Since SPROUT does not display deletion types and
their respective frequencies, we considered analyzing only
inDelphi and FORECasT in this section. Both inDelphi and
FORECasT displayed prediction of MMEJ deletion with a high
percentage. The difference between the predicted frequency and
the observed frequency of deletion events was highly signiﬁcant
(p < 0.0001) (Figure 4B). We have also noticed that the models
predicted deletions deviated from the observed deletion types in
the tested genomic sites ( Supplementary Tables S2– 4). For
example, a AA deletion was found to be the most frequent
(average 6.7%) deletion type in theALS locus (Supplementary
Table S2). However, inDelphi and FORECasT failed to predict
this deletion in their top nine deletion types (Supplementary
Figure S4). ForActin, both inDelphi and FOREcasT projected an
identical 7 bp deletion with>10% frequency (top deletion class)
(Supplementary Figure S7). Surprisingly, we could notﬁnd a
single read with the −7 bp deletion in a total of 179 K reads
(Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, observed deletion types at
the CC locus did not match the predicted deletions
(Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S4). It
is notable that while types of insertion were common across
different pooled samples for the same target, deletion types were
found rarely common (Supplementary Tables S2– 4). In our deep
sequencing data, we found a signiﬁcant amount of reads with
combined insertion and deletion. Base substitutions were also
common. However, the models (inDelphi, FORECasT, and
SPROUT) cannot foresee these kinds of mutation classes. Our
results indicate that these models are not good at predicting
deletions and base changes in rice plant.
59 and 3’ Modiﬁcations of Guide RNA Do Not
Seem to Impact CRISPR-Cas9 Editing
Efﬁciency
T h ec o m m o n l yu s e ds i n g l eg u i d eR N A( g R N A )i saf u s i o no ft h e
crispr RNA (crRNA) and transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA)
through a short RNA loop (Jinek et al., 2012). Engineering and
manipulation of gRNA has been one of the important areas of
research for broadening the applications of the CRISPR-Cas system.
The introduction of extra nucleotides at either of the gRNA ends
could be useful for many genome editing applications, such as
adding RNA aptamers to recruit different effector proteins and
fusing donor templates for HDR. The degree of gRNA modiﬁcations
that can be tolerated without affecting its binding with Cas9 and
subsequent genome targeting is crucial to deﬁne (Nowak et al.,
2016). Whether fusion of long sequence at either of the 5′ and 3’
ends of gRNA has any impact in Cas9 cleavage efﬁciency is not well
established in the plant system.
In the retron approach, donor template coding sequences were
fused at the 5′ end of the gRNA (Figure 1B). The length of the
sequence fused was 228 nucleotides, including the chimeric
retron-donor. The 5′ end is crucial for gRNA function as the
20 bp protospacer that determines the genomic target site is
located at this end. From our deep sequencing data at all three
target sites, it is clear that the DSB formation ability of Cas9 was
not hampered at all by the fusion at 5′ end of gRNA. For example,
in ALS, the CRISPEY construct yielded an average of 67.24%
mutation, while the control construct with canonical gRNA
showed 68.30% of the population with mutation
(Supplementary Table S2 ). Similarly, for the Actin target,
77.86% mutant population was obtained with canonical gRNA,
whereas 87% mutant population was generated by 5′ extended
gRNA (Supplementary Table S3). CC target was mutated with an
average ef ﬁciency of 79.15% with 5 ′ extended gRNA
(Supplementary Table S4). The results of this study indicate
that 5′ extension of gRNA is probably not an inhibitory factor for
Cas9 cleavage in plants (Figure 4C). However, a recentin vitro
study showed that 5′ addition of only two to three unpaired
nucleotides in SpCas9 gRNA has a signiﬁcant effect on the
cleavage activity of the RuvC domain (Mullally et al., 2020).
Another study reported 5’ end modiﬁcations of gRNA retain
cleavage activity in mammalian cells, although found some length
effect (Kocak et al., 2019).
On the contrary to the retron approach, we fused 200– 250 bp
donor template sequence at the 3′ end of the respective gRNA
sequence (Figure 1C). As evidenced by our result atALS and Pita
loci, DSB induction efﬁciency was very high with the gRNA
extended at 3 ′ end. In terms of the overall NHEJ editing
efﬁciencies of the randomly chosenALS lines tested, 92% of the
lines had editing, with 84.6% as monoallelic and 7.7% as biallelic. On
the other hand, 76.4% of the tested lines forPita had editing, with
47% as monoallelic and 29.4% as biallelic. Of the nine lines where
both ALS and Pita were sequenced, 55.5% (5) displayed editing in
both loci, conﬁrming multiplex editing (Supplementary Table S5).
These results indicate a fusion of ~200 nt long sequence at the 3′ end
of gRNA did not signiﬁcantly impact cleavage efﬁciency in riceALS
and Pita loci. cgRNAs were also found to be fully functional in
generating DSB in rice in an earlier study (Butt et al., 2017). The
recently developed prime editing technique depends on a 3′
extended guide RNA ( Anzalone et al., 2019 ). Similarly,
modiﬁcation of the 3 ′ e n do fg R N Aw a sw e l lt o l e r a t e db y
SpCas9 in a previous study ( Palumbo et al., 2020 ). Taken
together, our data suggest that both 5′ and 3’ ends of gRNA are
amenable for modiﬁcation without signiﬁcantly affecting the Cas9
cleavage activity in rice.
CONCLUSION
We demonstrated that the Cas9 repair outcome, speciﬁcally the type
and fraction of 1 bp insertion, is predictable in the plant system by
employing machine learning models. Among the models tested,
inDelphi outperformed the other two models, FORECasT and
SPROUT. Applicability of thosem o d e l st ot h ep l a n ts y s t e m
greatly enhances the ability of plant researchers to better design
their experiments for knockout as well as precise genome editing.
However, the models failed to accurately predict deletions. We also
presented data showing ineffectiveness of retron- or cgRNA-

mediated approaches to achieve HDR in rice. Moreover, we showed
5′ and 3′ extension of gRNA with 200– 230 nt long sequences did not
impact high cleavage activity of Cas9. Although more genomic sites
need to be tested for getting a comprehensive idea about the impact of
this fusion on DSB generation efﬁciency, our data would encourage
researchers to explore new enhancements to CRISPR-Cas tools.
