Abstract
Multicopy single-stranded DNAs (msDNAs) are hybrid RNA-DNA molecules encoded on
retroelements called retrons and produced by the action of retron reverse transcriptases.
Retrons are widespread in bacteria but the natural function of msDNA has remained elusive
despite 30 years of study. The major roadblock to elucidation of the function of these unique
molecules has been the lack of any identifiable phenotypes for mutants unable to make
msDNA. We report that msDNA of the zoonotic pathogenSalmonella Typhimurium is nec-
essary for colonization of the intestine. Similarly, we observed a defect in intestinal persis-
tence in an enteropathogenicE. coli mutant lacking its retron reverse transcriptase. Under
anaerobic conditions in the absence of msDNA, proteins of central anaerobic metabolism
needed forSalmonella colonization of the intestine are dysregulated. We show that the
msDNA-deficient mutant can utilize nitrate, but not other alternate electron acceptors in
anaerobic conditions. Consistent with the availability of nitrate in the inflamed gut, a neutro-
philic inflammatory response partially rescued the ability of a mutant lacking msDNA to colo-
nize the intestine. These findings together indicate that the mechanistic basis of msDNA
function duringSalmonella colonization of the intestine is proper production of proteins
needed for anaerobic metabolism. We further conclude that a natural function of msDNA is
to regulate protein abundance, the first attributable function for any msDNA. Our data pro-
vide novel insight into the function of this mysterious molecule that likely represents a new
class of regulatory molecules.

Author Summary
Multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) is a unique molecule consisting of both an
RNA and DNA portion. This molecule is produced by a reverse transcriptase and has no
known natural function despite more than 30 years of study. We report that msDNA is
important for bothSalmonella Typhimurium and an enteropathogenicE. coli, two patho-
gens that cause diarrhea in susceptible hosts, to survive in the intestine. Using mutant
strains incapable of producing msDNA, we show that msDNA is needed forSalmonella to
grow in the absence of oxygen. Mutants grown in oxygen-deficient conditions have sub-
stantial changes in overall protein composition, including numerous proteins known to be
important for anaerobic metabolism and growth in the intestine. Our findings link
msDNA to the ability ofSalmonella to thrive in an oxygen-deficient environment similar
to the conditions inside the gut. We report that msDNA regulates the quantity of proteins,
the first natural function attributed to this molecule. msDNA may represent a new class of
regulatory molecules.
Introduction
Retron reverse transcriptases (RT) in bacteria were first described inMyxococcus xanthus[1]
and E. coli [2] in the 1980s and are now known to be widely distributed in the genomes of
eubacteria and archaea (reviewed in [3]). All retrons contain three regions essential for produc-
tion of msDNA:msr (RNA primer for reverse transcription),msd (template sequence), and a
reverse transcriptase (RT). The retrons of pathogens, such asSalmonella Typhimurium (STm),
may also encode an additional ORF of unknown function [4]. The product of the‘retron’is a
small covalently linked RNA-DNA hybrid molecule called multicopy single-stranded DNA
(msDNA) that is predicted to form complex secondary structures [5]. The predicted secondary
structures of msDNA from enteric pathogens including STm, enteropathogenicE. coli and Vib-
rio spp. are similar [4] but the reverse transcriptase amino acid sequence from these enteric
pathogens share little identity. The location of the retron as well as the number of retrons in
each species varies. These observations suggest that retrons have been horizontally acquired by
convergent evolution to function in a fashion that is specific to the biology of the host
bacterium.
Although the molecular details of the production of msDNA have been heavily studied, no
natural function has been attributed to this mysterious molecule despite 30 years of study
(reviewed in [3]). A critical obstacle to elucidating the natural function of msDNA was the lack
of any phenotype for mutants unable to make this molecule. We have shown that the retron
reverse transcriptase encoded bySTM3846 is essential forSalmonella Typhimurium (STm) to
colonize the calf intestine [6], a natural model of enteric salmonellosis that recapitulates the
earliest stages of human non-typhoidalSalmonella (NTS) infection. This was the first reported
phenotype for a mutant lacking a retron reverse transcriptase.
NTS are major threats to global animal and human health, causing more than 90 million
cases of gastroenteritis in people worldwide [7]. Human enteric salmonellosis is characterized
by inflammatory diarrhea containing primarily neutrophils. To efficiently colonize the host,
NTS use the type 3-secretion system 1 (T3SS-1) encoded onSalmonella Pathogenicity Island-1
(SPI-1) to invade the intestinal epithelium [8,9] and to promote the characteristic neutrophilic
inflammatory response. The host inflammatory response givesSalmonella a competitive
advantage over resident microflora. Within the intestinal lumen, the product of the neutro-
philic oxidative burst generates tetrathionate from oxidation of thiosulfate [10]. Salmonella

uses tetrathionate as a terminal electron acceptor within the anaerobic conditions of the intesti-
nal lumen to gain a competitive advantage over resident microflora. Effectors of the TTSS-1
may directly activate epithelial production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) thereby
creating nitrate, an additional terminal electron acceptor [11]. The relative importance of
nitrate during infection is illustrated by the fact that it is a powerful chemoattractant forSalmo-
nella during anaerobiosis [12]. In addition,Salmonella uses host-derived nutrients such as eth-
anolamine [13] during intestinal inflammation. These strategies facilitate the growth of
Salmonella in the complex microbial community of the intestine.
We used the enteric pathogen,Salmonella Typhimurium, to dissect the function of
msDNA. In the work described here, we report that mutants lacking msDNA produced by
the STM3846 reverse transcriptase are defective for colonization of the intestine using
murine models of salmonellosis. This colonization defect is due, in part, to a growth defect
for these mutants in anaerobic conditions. We show that mutants lacking msDNA have
altered abundance of over 200 proteins in anaerobiosis, many of which are known to be
required for growth in anaerobic conditions and for the pathogenesis of STm during enteric
infection. Inappropriate abundance of proteinsencoding alternate terminal electron acceptor
reductases results in an inability of mutants lacking msDNA to utilize these compounds,
inhibiting anaerobic growthin vitro. The mutants lacking msDNA can only utilize nitrate as
an anaerobic terminal electron acceptor. Mutants lacking msDNA fail to colonize portions of
the intestine lacking substantial neutrophilic inflammation, likely due to the ability to only
utilize nitrate to support anaerobic growth. Finally, we report a similar defect in intestinal
persistence for an enteropathogenicE. coli lacking its retron reverse transcriptase suggesting
that msDNA is critical for enteric pathogens to thrive in the intestine of mammalian hosts.
Thus, we report a role in regulating protein abundance for msDNA, the first reported natural
function for any msDNA. msDNA may represent a new class of bacterial regulatory
molecules.
Results
msDNA is critical for STm intestinal colonization
Retron reverse transcriptases, including theSTM3846 reverse transcriptase of the St-85 retron,
use msr to prime reverse transcription of themsd template sequence to produce msDNA [14]
(Fig 1A). We generated a non-polar deletion ofmsd to establish that msDNA, and not some
other potential product of the STM3846 RT, mediates STm colonization of the intestine.
Neither theΔSTM3846 mutant nor theΔmsd mutant produce msDNA and its production
can be restored in both mutants by complementationin trans(Fig 1B). The additional ORF,
STM3845, is dispensable for msDNA production.
We used the murine colitis model [15], which responds to NTS infection with profound
neutrophilic inflammation in the cecum, to dissect the function of the retron in intestinal colo-
nization. We confirmed the requirement forSTM3846 in colonization of the inflamed intestine
in this model (Fig 1C). In addition, both theΔmsd and ΔSTM3846 mutants have indistinguish-
able phenotypes, suggesting that the effect of deletion of the RT is mediated by the msDNA
itself. The ability of each of these mutants to colonize the intestine is rescued by complementa-
tion in trans(Fig 1C and 1D). In cell culture, only theΔmsd mutant invades epithelial cells at a
level mildly reduced compared to the isogenic wild type (S1 Fig) suggesting that reduced tissue
invasion is unlikely to be the cause of the phenotype that we observed during infection of ani-
mal models. Our findings definitively link msDNA to the ability ofSalmonella to colonize the
intestine.

msDNA and anaerobiosis
The intestine is a specialized and highly diverse niche. Oxygen tensions within the lumen
decline from the stomach to the colon [16,17], and there is a gradient of increasing oxygen ten-
sion from the center of the lumen towards the epithelium [18]. Enteric pathogens must repli-
cate in this hypoxic setting using both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways [19,20] and
express genes necessary for virulence in order to compete with resident microflora and colonize
the host efficiently.
To determine whether the intestinal colonization defect of the STm msDNA mutants could
be due to an inability to grow in oxygen limited conditions, we measured the growth of our
mutants in the absence of oxygen, a condition where the retron is highly expressed [21]. Both
mutants unable to produce msDNA have severe growth defects in rich media in anaerobic con-
ditions (Fig 2A and 2B, S2 Fig), while the growth of these mutants in the presence of oxygen is

similar to the isogenic WT in both rich and minimal media (Fig 2C–2F). The necessity for
msDNA during anaerobic growth is consistent with the inability of msDNA-deficient mutants
to efficiently colonize the intestine.

msDNA as a regulator
We hypothesized that msDNA might act as atrans regulator of gene expression for two rea-
sons. First, small RNAs are well known to have regulatory properties through base pairing with
DNA or mRNA transcripts [22]. Second, substantial over-expression of msDNA from one
strain ofE. coli in a heterologous strain lacking a retron resulted in small changes in the prote-
ome [23]. To determine whether the msDNA produced by the St-85 retron might have regula-
tory properties, we evaluated the proteome of the WT and msDNA-deficient mutants
(ΔSTM3846 and Δmsd) at late exponential phase, a time when the retron is expressed and
msDNA is produced (Fig 1Band [24]), in both the presence and absence of oxygen. Of the
1504 total proteins identified, no significant differences in protein abundance between the WT
and mutants in the presence of oxygen were detected (Fig 3and S1 Table). This finding is con-
sistent with previous findings that mutants lacking msDNA grow indistinguishably from the

wild type organism in standard laboratory conditions (Fig 2C–2F). In addition, we noted that
very few proteins differ in abundance between theΔSTM3846 and Δmsd mutants, consistent
with the hypothesis that the reverse transcriptase and msDNA operate in the same biological
pathway.
In anaerobic conditions however, we identified 238 proteins that differed in abundance
between the wild type and msDNA-deficient mutants (Fig 3and S1 Table). Forty-three per-
cent of proteins with reduced abundance in the mutant were involved in amino acid and car-
bohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion (Table 1). Twenty-five
percent of all proteins of altered abundance did not belong to a functional grouping
(Table 1). The abundance of proteins encoded on SPI-1 was unchanged in the absence of
msDNA (Fig 3). Proteins necessary for motility were increased in abundance in anaerobically
grown msDNA-deficient strains (Fig 3). However, this apparent increase did not result in a

change in swimming motility of these strains in anaerobic conditions compared with the WT
(S3 Fig). The abundance of numerous proteins known to be important for anaerobic growth
and intestinal colonization was significantly reduced (Fig 3and S1 Table), including proteins
for 1,2 propanediol utilization [25], ethanolamine utilization [13], anaerobic sn-glycerol-
3-phosphate utilization [26], anaerobic vitamin B12 biosynthesis [27], and serine/threonine
degradation [28].
Numerous proteins involved in reduction of anaerobic electron acceptors [29] were altered
in abundance between msDNA mutants and wild type bacteria during anaerobic growth (Fig
3). Proteins important for the reduction of thiosulfate (PhsAB) and sulfide (AsrC) were of low
abundance (Fig 4[adapted from [30]] andS1 Table). In addition, proteins necessary for the
reduction of DMSO (DmsA, STM4305.s) and fumarate (FrdA) were in low abundance in
mutants lacking msDNA, although they did not meet our stringent criteria for statistical signif-
icance. Expression of genes necessary to utilize alternate electron acceptors is often induced by
the presence of the electron acceptor [29] so the absence of a statistically significant reduction
in some of these proteins is not surprising because these compounds were not present in the
growth conditions we used. Interestingly, NapA, encoding the periplasmic nitrate reductase
[29], was one of the proteins that was present in increased abundance in msDNA deficient
mutants compared to the WT, and there was no change in the abundance of NarGH, one of

the two other nitrate reductase complexes (Fig 4and S1 Table). These data are consistent with
the growth defect of our mutants in anaerobic conditions, and suggest that msDNA-deficient
mutants have a severe dysregulation of proteins necessary for reduction of terminal electron
acceptors needed during anaerobiosis.
Anaerobic terminal electron acceptor utilization in msDNA mutants
Our proteomic data predict that msDNA is critical for STm to produce proteins necessary for
reduction of terminal electron acceptors critical for metabolism during anaerobic conditions.
In order to confirm that the reduced abundance of anaerobic terminal electron acceptor reduc-
tases, as indicated by our proteomic data, has functional consequences, we tested the ability of
the addition of various terminal electron acceptors to rescue anaerobic growth of theSTM3846
mutant. We found that providing the alternate electron acceptors fumarate, DMSO, or thiosul-
fate to the culture media during anaerobic growth failed to restore growth of the strain lacking
msDNA to WT levels (Figs5B–5F, 6B and 6C). This finding makes sense, as our proteomic
data suggest that the enzymes that transfer electrons to these terminal electron acceptors dur-
ing anaerobic growth, thiosulfate reductase, sulfide reductase, fumarate reductase, and two
DMSO reductases, are reduced in abundance in mutants that lack msDNA. However, the addi-
tion of nitrate to culture medium rescued the anaerobic growth of the reverse transcriptase
mutant (Figs5A and 6A). These data are consistent with our proteomic data showing that
mutants lacking msDNA have adequate NarG and an increased amount of NapA allowing
these strains to use nitrate as a terminal acceptor for electrons during anaerobic growth.

msDNA and colonization of the inflamed intestine
In the presence of an intact T3SS-1, NTS induce an inflammatory response that includes
recruitment of luminal neutrophils and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase as part of
the inflammatory response [9,10,31], resulting in generation of tetrathionate and nitrate as
available terminal electron acceptors in the inflamed intestine. To determine whether the colo-
nization defects we observed were dependent on a functional T3SS-1 and host neutrophilic
inflammatory response, we performed competitive infection experiments between the virulent
WT and theΔSTM3846 mutant both in the presence and absence of SPI-1 (Fig 7A). We
observed that aΔSTM3846 mutant colonizes the intestine poorly and associated organs. The
modest colonization defect may be due to an inability to utilize carbon and amino acid sources
within the inflamed intestine [13], or due to poor growth compared with WT prior to the host
inflammatory response. Interestingly, the colonization defect of theΔSTM3846 mutant in the
mouse cecum was exacerbated in the absence of a functional T3SS-1, suggesting that a robust
inflammatory response partially rescues mutants unable to produce msDNA (Fig 7A). Consis-
tent with this finding both the small and large intestines, which lack appreciable neutrophilic
inflammation (Fig 7C), are poorly colonized with theΔSTM3846 mutant in mice inoculated
with this strain alone (Fig 7B). In murine models that do not develop a neutrophilic infiltrate
in the intestine in response to infection (murine typhoid model), theΔSTM3846 mutant also
colonizes poorly after oral infection (Fig 8A and 8B). Our results suggest thatSTM3846 is
essential for STm to colonize the intestine, a defect that is partially rescued in the presence of a
profound host inflammatory response, supporting the necessity for intact anaerobic metabolic
pathways in intestinal colonization.
msDNA in enteropathogenicE. coli
The msDNA of STm is similar in predicted secondary structure to msDNA of other enteric
pathogens including enteropathogenicE. coli (EPEC; [4]), a close relative of STm. EPEC atta-
ches to the epithelial surface causing characteristic attaching and effacing lesions and a malab-
sorptive diarrhea [32]. Despite the fact that the pathology caused by NTS and EPEC is distinct,
both organisms colonize the intestine and cause diarrheal illness in susceptible hosts. We
hypothesized that the RT of EPEC O127:H6, a serotype previously shown to produce msDNA
[33], is necessary for this organism to colonize the gut. To test this hypothesis, we generated a
non-polar deletion of the retron RT (ΔE2348C_3890) and performed competitive infections
between this mutant and the WT. We found that an EPEC mutant lacking the RT fails to per-
sist within the intestine of mice, both in the luminal contents and adherent to tissue (Fig 9).
This defect was reversed by complementationin trans(S4 Fig). These data suggest that the
importance of retron reverse transcriptases during intestinal infection is not restricted to sal-
monellae, and thus are likely to be more broadly applicable to enteric pathogens.
Discussion
The natural function of msDNA has remained elusive despite more than 30 years of study
[1,2,5,34–38]. We describe the first phenotypes for any mutant lacking msDNA. Using the
enteric pathogenS. Typhimurium, we show that msDNA produced by a retron reverse tran-
scriptase is critical for efficient colonization of the mammalian intestine. In STm, msDNA is
absence (black bars) or presence (white bars) of DMSO. Bars represent mean +/- SEM of at least three
independent experiments.* Indicates significant difference between mutant and WT for that condition

critical for the ability to grow in the absence of oxygen. Identification of these phenotypes cre-
ates the first opportunity for detailed studies of the molecular function of msDNA since the
discovery of these unique molecules. We further showed that STm msDNA directs coloniza-
tion of the intestine through regulation of the abundance of proteins necessary for central
anaerobic metabolism. Thus, our data suggest that the natural function of msDNA may be to
control protein abundance, the first natural function to be ascribed to any msDNA molecule.
In STm, msDNA is produced by the STM3846 reverse transcriptase usingmsd as a template
sequence andmsr as a primer. The msDNA from STm has a predicted 85-nucleotide DNA
stem with no mismatched base pairs and a 4-nucleotide loop, and an RNA portion with two
predicted smaller imperfect stem loop structures [4]. The RNA and DNA portions of msDNA
are covalently joined by a unique 2’5’phosphodiester linkage on a conserved guanine [39]. It is
unclear whether the entiremsr RNA sequence remains in the mature STm msDNA. Consistent
with prior reports [34,39], we showed that both the RT andmsd are requirements for produc-
tion of msDNA. The intervening ORF,STM3845, is dispensable for msDNA production. This
is perhaps not surprising as the presence of another ORF in addition to the RT in retrons is rel-
atively rare, and appears to be more common on retrons borne by pathogens [4,40,41]. It has
been suggested that the retron RT could produce a variety of different cDNA molecules if the
sequence of the mRNA transcript is identical to that of the 5’end ofmsr [42]. However, we
observed similar defects in intestinal colonization and anaerobic growth of mutants lacking
either the RT ormsd. These data suggest that it is msDNA, and not some other potential prod-
uct of the RT, that mediates intestinal colonization of STm.
Previous attempts to evaluate the function of msDNA have used artificial systems, failing to
identify phenotypes for mutants lacking msDNA and to definitively identify the natural func-
tion of these molecules [23,43–47]. When an msDNA from one strain ofE. coli with mis-
matched base pairs in the predicted DNA stem region is significantly overexpressed in a
heterologous strain ofE. coli lacking its own retron, the frequency of spontaneous mutation
was increased due to sequestration of mismatch repair proteins [43,44,46]. Thus, the produc-
tion of msDNA was thought to increase mutation frequency. However, no previous work has
demonstrated that deletion of msDNA from a bacterium naturally producing msDNA
decreases mutation frequency. We hypothesize that substantial over-expression of any mis-
matched DNA could increase mutation frequency by the same mechanism. Thus, this previous
finding may not illuminate the true function of msDNA in the cell.
When mutants lacking the ability to make msDNA are grown without oxygen, 15% of all
proteins we could identify were in altered abundance. However, no dysregulated proteins were
identified during aerobic growth, consistent with the lack of identifiable phenotypes in the
presence of oxygen. Our proteomic data were generated using cultures grown for the same
duration of time under varying growth conditions. Some of the differences in protein abun-
dance may result because wild type and mutant that cannot make msDNA grow differently
during anaerobic conditions. However, our growth data suggest that the growth phase of the
wild type and mutants unable to make msDNA are not dramatically different at the times we
chose to collect samples for our analysis. Furthermore, the differences in protein abundance
between the msDNA mutant and the wild type during anaerobic growth that we re-tested

appear to be functionally significant. We show that the growth of mutants that cannot make
msDNA, and that have reduced abundance of several alternate electron acceptor reductases
needed during anaerobic growth, cannot be rescued by addition of the cognate alternate elec-
trons. Furthermore, the msDNA mutant overproduces periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapA)
and a wild type level of a second nitrate reductase (NarG). We show that these proteins and

thus this pathway are functional, as the exogenous addition of the terminal electron acceptor
nitrate rescues the anaerobic growth of mutants unable to make msDNA. Prior reports suggest
that the DNA portion of msDNA can be engineered to act as a regulatory molecule by creating
an antisense sequence in the DNA loop [45]. Our data suggest that the natural function of
msDNA may be to act as a regulatory molecule although we have not yet identified specific reg-
ulatory targets.
There are two known master regulators of anaerobic metabolism in facultative anaerobes:
fnr and arcA [48]. The transcriptional and protein profiles of anaerobically-grownSalmonella
mutants deficient infnr and arcA are established [49,50]. With few exceptions, the proteins of
altered abundance in our proteomic data align poorly with genes regulated by eitherfnr or
arcA. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons across our proteomic data and
published transcriptional profiles of mutants grown in the absence of oxygen, because of pro-
tein profiles with transcript abundance are not directly comparable. Our data raise the possibil-
ity that regulation by msDNA may represent an additional pathway to regulate the abundance
of proteins necessary for anaerobic metabolism. Further mechanistic study of the anaerobic

euthanized at day 10 post-infection. Intestinal contents were removed and intestinal tissue washed in PBS

regulation of gene and protein expression is critical to understanding the behavior ofSalmo-
nella in intestinal colonization.
Recent evidence suggests thatSalmonella exploits the host inflammatory response to gain a
competitive advantage in the intestinal lumen [10–13]. Reactive oxygen species produced by
neutrophils oxidize thiosulfate to tetrathionate, a compound thatSalmonella, but not resident
microflora, uses as a terminal electron acceptor [10]. Epithelial-derived nitrate also contributes
to the growth ofSalmonella in the anaerobic conditions of the intestine by acting as a preferred
electron acceptor in these conditions [31]. Some nutrients, such as ethanolamine, are used only
during the neutrophilic inflammatory response [13]. We have shown that some of these pro-
cesses in STm are altered in mutants unable to produce msDNA, along with many other pro-
teins with less clearly defined roles in pathogenesis.
We also observed a defect in intestinal persistence of an EPEC mutant lacking its retron RT.
Salmonella entericaand E. coli are close phylogenetic relatives and both cause diarrheal illness
in susceptible hosts, but there are critical differences in the retron between organisms. The RT
of EPEC O127:H6 is located in a different genomic context than the retron of STm and has a
GC content of 51.8%, similar to the average GC content of 50.6% [51] suggesting that this gene
was not acquired recently. This GC content in the EPEC retron is in contrast to the GC content
of the retron of STm, 30.6% compared with the average GC content of 52.4% [4,52]. Unlike
STm, the retron of EPEC O127:H6 lacks an additional ORF. The predicted secondary struc-
tures of msDNA from EPEC and STm are similar, however EPEC msDNA is predicted to have
mismatched base pairs in the DNA stem [4]. Despite these differences, we report that EPEC
mutants lacking the retron RT also have a phenotype during colonization of the intestine.
Critical differences also exist between the pathogenesis of EPEC and STm diarrheal diseases.
In the intestine,Salmonella lives both in the lumen and invades the epithelium, replicating
intracellularly and inducing a profound neutrophilic inflammatory diarrhea [53]. In contrast,
EPEC attaches to the intestinal epithelium below the intestinal mucus in these regions of the
gastrointestinal tract and remains extracellular [54]. Although our understanding of the molec-
ular mechanism of the development of diarrhea during EPEC infection is incomplete, this
infection causes a secretory diarrhea [32]. Thus, the mechanism of EPEC-induced diarrhea is
substantially different than the inflammatory diarrhea caused by non-typhoidal salmonellae.
Our data suggest that retron RTs are critical for colonization of the intestine by both of these
pathogens, yet the phenotypes of these mutants inSalmonella versus EPEC during infection
are different. While the role of retron reverse transcriptases and msDNA in intestinal coloniza-
tion by enteric pathogens is likely to be ubiquitous, we hypothesize based both on our data and
on the differences in diseases between these two organisms, that the processes regulated and
the regulatory targets themselves are likely to be different.
We show that a natural function of msDNA is to regulate protein abundance, the first
reported natural function of any msDNA molecule. STm mutants unable to make msDNA
poorly colonize the murine intestine. This colonization defect is due to altered abundance of
numerous proteins, including those necessary for central anaerobic metabolism, a process
known to be necessary for the ability of STm to colonize the intestine of mammals. We
observed that an EPEC mutant lacking its retron reverse transcriptase has a reduced ability to
persist in the murine intestine, suggesting that the presence and function of msDNA may be
broadly applicable to other enteric pathogens. Retrons are also widespread in non-pathogenic
eubacteria (Reviewed in [3]) including most isolates of the environmental bacteriumMyxococ-
cus xanthus[35]. msDNA is present in high copy per cell [1], suggesting that the regulatory
function of this molecule is critical for the lifestyle of the host bacterium. It is puzzling that this
molecule appears to have a function under only certain conditions despite the fact that it is pro-
duced in abundance. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that msDNA may sense

environmental changes in order to regulate gene expression. This hybrid RNA-DNA molecule
represents an exciting new class of bacterial regulatory molecules with broad application to the
understanding of the lifestyles of pathogens and non-pathogens alike.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains
All bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used for mutant construction are listed inS2 Table,
S3 Table). AllSalmonella strains are derivatives of ATCC 14028s. EnteropathogenicE. coli
O127:H6 strain E2348/69 [55], a generous gift of M. Donnenberg, is the genetic background
for all EPEC mutants described here. Mutants were constructed using a modification of the
lambda-red recombination technique and antibiotic resistance cassettes removed as previously
described [56,57][ 58]. AllSalmonella mutations were moved into a clean genetic background
by P22 transduction [59]. Standard cloning protocols were used to generate complementing
plasmids [60].
All bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C aerobically with vigorous agitation or standing in
an anaerobic chamber with internal atmosphere of 5% H
2,5 %C O2, and 90% N2 (Bactron I,
ShelLab). For anaerobic growth experiments, bacteria were grown overnight aerobically then
transferred into the anaerobic chamber and diluted 1:100 into media pre-equilibrated for at
least 18 hours. Alternate electron acceptors (Sigma-Aldrich) sodium nitrate, sodium fumarate,
sodium thiosulfate, and sodium tetrathionate were added to LB to a final concentration of
40mM. Sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 40 mM served as a nega-
tive control. DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to LB to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v).
Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB or MacConkey (Difco) agar supple-
mented with the following antibiotics as appropriate: kanamycin (50 mg/L), nalidixic acid (50
mg/L), carbenicillin (100 mg/L), streptomycin (100 mg/L), and chloramphenicol (20 mg/L).
All experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions. Bacterial generation
number was calculated using the following equation: [log
10(CFU final)— log10(CFU start)]/
log10(2).
Mouse infections
Ethics Statement: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Texas A&M University and North Carolina
State University approved all animal experiments (protocol numbers 2012–084 and 2011–167
(TAMU) and 14–132-B (NCSU)). All experiments that utilized mice were performed using
8–12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories). For competitive infection experi-
ments, mice were infected by gavage with an equivalent ratio of WT and mutant bacteria. The
competitive index was determined by dividing the ratio of WT to mutant bacteria in the
selected organ by that ratio in the inoculum. For single infections, mice were infected with
either WT or mutant bacteria. The harvested tissue was weighed, homogenized, and CFU was
determined per gram of tissue collected.
Salmonella infections were performed as previously described [15]. For the murine colitis
model, mice were administered 20 mg streptomycin in 75μL sterile water by gavage. Twenty-
four hours after treatment, mice were infected with approximately 10
8 CFU ofSalmonella in
100 μL volume by gavage. Feces were collected 24 hours after infection. Mice were euthanized
by carbon dioxide asphyxiation at 96 hours post-infection and organs harvested, homogenized,
serially diluted, and plated on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics for enumeration of CFU.

For the murine typhoid model, mice were treated with 75μL sterile water by gavage. Mice were
then infected and euthanized as above.
EPEC mouse infections were performed essentially as previously described [61]. Mice were
infected with approximately 108 CFU in 100μL volume by gavage. Feces were collected every
other day for 9 days. Mice were euthanized 10 days post-infection. The aboral 5 cm of small
intestine, the entire cecum, and the entire colon were collected. Intestinal contents were
exposed through a longitudinal incision. The intestinal segment was placed into sterile PBS
and vigorously agitated to remove intestinal contents. Intestinal tissue was washed in sterile
PBS to remove remaining ingesta. Intestinal contents and tissue were homogenized separately,
serially diluted, and plated on MacConkey agar and LB agar with appropriate antibiotics to
enumerate CFU.
Histopathology
Samples from mouse ileum, cecum, and transverse colon were collected 96 hours post-infec-
tion and fixed in formalin. All tissues were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. All histologic analyses were performed by a veterinary pathologist blinded as to
infection group. Tissues were scored (0–4) for each of the following parameters: polymorpho-
nuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, crypt abscess, submucosal
edema, villus blunting, and epithelial damage as described [13,15,62,63].
msDNA isolation
msDNA was isolated from aerobic late log phase cultures normalized by OD600. Bacteria were
lysed as for plasmid isolation (Qiagen Mini-prep) and msDNA isolated from the filtered frac-
tion with subsequent ethanol precipitation. msDNA was visualized using a native polyacryl-
amide gel with in-gel ethidium bromide staining.
Invasion assays
Cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used within 15
passages. HeLa cells (human cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial, ATCC CCL-2) were grown as
recommended by ATCC. HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 x 10
4 cells/well approxi-
mately 24 h prior to infection.
Late-log phase cultures were prepared by inoculating 10 ml LB broth with 0.3 ml overnight
shaking culture. Flasks were grown at 37°C with agitation for 3 hours. Bacteria were collected
by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 90 seconds, resuspended in an equal volume of Hanks’buff-
ered saline solution (HBSS, Mediatech) and added directly to mammalian cells seeded in
24-well plates for 10 minutes. The multiplicity of infection was approximately 50. Non-inter-
nalized bacteria were removed by aspiration. Monolayers were washed three times in HBSS
and were then incubated in growth media until 30 min post-infection. Thereafter, gentamicin
was added at 50μg/ml from 30–90 min p.i. to kill extracellular bacteria and reduced to 10μg/
ml from 90 min post-infection For enumeration of intracellular bacteria, monolayers were
washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized in 0.2% sodium deoxycholate
and serial dilutions were plated on LB agar.
Motility assays
Swimming motility was performed as previously described [64]. Swimming was assayed on
plates containing 0.3% Difco Bacto Agar (LB agar base 25g/L). Plates were incubated either in
open air or in the anaerobic chamber overnight prior to use for swimming assays. Overnight

cultures of bacterial strains were grown at 37°C with agitation and cell numbers normalized by
optical density. An aliquot of each normalized culture was transferred into the anaerobic cham-
ber. The WT,ΔSTM3846, andΔmsd mutants (3μl each) were spotted onto the same swimming
agar plate and incubated at 37°C aerobically or anaerobically for 5 hours. The diameter of the
cell spread was measured and compared with that of the WT on the same plate. Each assay was
performed in triplicate on three independent occasions (anaerobic) or in four replicates on two
independent occasions (aerobic).
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All data were log transformed
prior to analysis. Statistical significance was set at P< 0.05 and was determined using a t-test
or ANOVA where indicated.
Proteomic analysis
Aerobic overnight cultures of the wild type and theΔSTM3846 and Δmsd mutants were diluted
1:100 and incubated either aerobically or in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) for 4 hours on three
independent occasions. Bacteria were pelleted and supernatants discarded. Cell pellets were
resuspended in 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0 and lysed by vigorous vortexing in the presence of
0.1 mm silica/zirconia beads. Proteins were denatured and reduced with 8M urea and 5 mM
dithiothrietol, respectively, for 30 minutes at 60°C. The proteins underwent enzymatic diges-
tion for 3 hours at 37°C with 1/50 enzyme/protein (w/w) ratio of sequencing-grade trypsin.
The resultant peptides were desalted for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis using C18 solid
phase extraction cartridges (50 mg, 1 mL, Discovery, Supelco). The cartridges were activated
with methanol, followed by equilibration with 0.1% TFA before loading the samples. The car-
tridges were then washed with 5% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA and eluted with 80% ACN/
0.1% TFA. Eluted peptides were concentrated in the vacuum centrifuge and diluted to a con-
centration of 0.5 mg/mL with water for the MS analysis.
Digested peptides were loaded into capillary columns (75μm x 35 cm, Polymicro) packed
with C18 beads (3μm particles, Phenomenex) connected to a custom-made 4-column LC sys-
tem [65]. The elution was performed using the following gradient: equilibration in 5% B sol-
vent, 5–8% B over 2 min, 8–12% B over 18 min, 12–35% B over 50 min, 35–60% min over 27
min and 60–95% B over 3 min. (solvent A: 0.1% FA; solvent B: 90% ACN/0.1% FA) and flow
rate of 300 nL/min. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed either on an Orbitrap (LTQ Orbi-
trap Velos, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer using chemically etched nanos-
pray emitters [66]. Full scan mass spectra were collected at 400–2000 m/z range and the ten
most intense ions were submitted to low-resolution CID fragmentation once (35% normalized
collision energy), before being dynamically excluded for 60 seconds.
Tandem mass spectra were searched with MSFG+ againstSalmonella entericaserovar
Typhimurium 14028s and common contaminant sequences (downloaded from NCBI, all in
forward and reversed orientations), using the following parameters: (i) partial tryptic digestion,
(ii) 50 ppm parent mass tolerance, (iii) methionine oxidation as a variable modification. The
peptides were filtered with a MSGF probability score [67] /C201x10
–9. Peak areas for each peptide
were retrieved using the MultiAlign tool [68], and to ensure the quality of peptide-to-peak
matching, the data was filtered with a Statistical Tools for AMT tag Confidence (STAC)
score /C210.7 and uniqueness probability/C210.5 [69]. Additionally, proteins were required to
have at least 2 peptides and at least one peptide with STAC/C210.9. Peptide abundance values
were log transformed and rolled-up into proteins using Qrollup tool, available in DAnTE [70].
Abundance values for each protein across all 32 conditions (WT, mutants, anaerobic, aerobic

each measurement where missing values were filled with 19.5. The Z-score transformation
enables comparisons of trends across conditions and proteins to identify relevant abundance
changes.
