Abstract
Retrons, found in bacteria and used for defense against phages,
generate a unique molecule known as multicopy single-stranded
DNA (msDNA). This msDNA mimics Okazaki fragments during
DNA replication, making it a promising tool for targeted gene
editing in prokaryotes. However, existing retron systems often
exhibit suboptimal editing ef ﬁciency. Here, we identify the msd
gene inEscherichia coli, which encodes the noncoding RNA template
for msDNA synthesis and carries the homologous sequence of the
target gene to be edited, as a critical bottleneck. Sequence
homology causes the msDNA to bind to the msd gene, thereby
reducing its efﬁciency in editing the target gene. To address this
issue, we engineer a retron system that tailors msDNA to the
leading strand of the plasmid containing the msd gene. This
strategy minimizes msd gene editing and reduces competition with
target genes, signi ﬁcantly increasing msDNA availability. Our
optimized system achieves very high retron editing ef ﬁciency,
enhancing performance and expanding the potential for in vivo
techniques that rely on homologous DNA synthesis.

Introduction
S i n g l e - s t r a n d e dD N A( s s D N A )h a se m e r g e da sap r o m i s i n gt o o lf o r
gene editing (van der Oost and Patinios,2023; Wannier et al,2021;
Yu et al,2000). They containﬂanking sequences (homology arms)
and a central region. Theﬂanking sequences are homologous to the
target region in the genome and are typically 30-100 base pairs
long, while the central region contains the desired genetic
modiﬁcations, such as nucleotide changes, insertions, or deletions.
These modiﬁcations in ssDNA enable desired genome editing in a
wide variety of bacteria (Murphy,2016;S h a r a ne ta l ,2009;Z h a n g
et al, 2000). The “annealing-integration ” model is widely
recognized as a ssDNA-mediated gene editing mechanism. In this
model, ssDNA-binding proteins f acilitate the alignment of the
ssDNA donor with its complementary strand near the replication
fork, creating a heteroduplex that includes a mutated strand. As
this heteroduplex is replicated , both mutated and wild-type
progeny are produced (Ellis et al, 2001;H u e ne ta l ,2006;
Thomason et al, 2016). Reports from several labs suggest that
ssDNA editing displays strand preference, whereby ssDNA with the
same sequence in the nascent lagging strand (Okazaki fragments)
produces a higher editing frequency than the leading strand
(Costantino and Court, 2003; Ellis et al,2001;L ie ta l ,2003). This
strand bias can be explained by the presence of more single-
stranded regions of DNA during lagging-strand synthesis than
during leading-strand synthesis, to which ssDNAs have access (Ellis
et al, 2001;H u e ne ta l ,2006).
Retrons are unique reverse tra nscription systems found in
various microbial genomes (Gonzalez-Delgado et al,2021;I n o u y e
and Inouye, 1993; Lampson et al, 2005;M e s t r ee ta l ,2020). One
example is the Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) system discovered in Escher-
ichia coli strain BL21. The retron operon consists of three genes:
msr/msd (for the noncoding RNA, ncRNA), ret (for the reverse
transcriptase, RTase) and ndt (for the ribosyltransferase effector
protein) (Lim and Maas, 1989;M e s t r ee ta l ,2020; Millman et al,
2020). The ncRNA itself has two regions: msr and msd.
RTase recognizes the structured ncRNA and uses the 2 ’-OH of
the conserved guanos ine residue in msr as a primer. It then
reverse-transcribes the msd sequence, producing a hybrid RNA-
ssDNA molecule called msDNA (Lampson et al, 2005;L i m
and Maas, 1989). During this process, endogenous RNase
H1 speciﬁcally digests the msd sequence (Lampson et al, 1989;
Palka et al, 2022).
The discovery that the msDNA from the retron system can be
used as-synthesized ssDNA in vivo for gene editing has attracted
widespread attention. The msd i nt h er e t r o no p e r o ns e r v e sa sa
template for msDNA production and is also the region where
exogenous sequences are inserted during gene editing (Farzadfard
et al, 2021; Farzadfard and Lu, 2014; Lear and Shipman, 2023;
Lopez et al, 2022;K a u ra n dP a t i ,2024; Simon et al,2019;S i m o n
et al, 2018;T a n ga n dS t e r n b e r g ,2023). During the editing process,
msDNA is integrated into the lagging strand of the DNA replicon
in the form of Okazaki fragments by the same mechanism as
ssDNA (Ellis et al,2001; Gallagher et al,2014;H u e ne ta l ,2006).

Researchers have been actively seeking to improve the efﬁciency of
retron-mediated gene editing. The gene editing efﬁciency of theﬁrst-
generation system inE. coli DH5α strain is less than 10−4 after ~30
generations of induction(24 h) (Farzadfard and Lu,2014). The second
generation involved introducing mutations in the 3′-5′ exonuclease
ExoX and the mismatch repair protein MutS intoE. coliTop 10 strains.
Following ~20 generations (16 h) of induction, the retron system’s
editing efﬁciency improved 100-fold to 6 × 10−2 (Simon et al,2018). In
the third generation, Schubert et al (2021)s i g n iﬁcantly improved editing
efﬁciency to nearly 100% after ~20 generations of induction and batch
growth. This was achieved in the EcNR1 strain by knocking out the
genes mutS, recJ (encoding a 5’-3’exonuclease), andsbcB (encoding a 3’-
5’exonuclease) and replacing the single-stranded annealing protein Beta
recombinase with CspRecT, another single-stranded annealing protein.
Other studies have demonstrated that knocking outrecJ and sbcB in
DH5α strains, combined with the overexpression of Beta recombinase,
can result in editing efﬁciencies nearing 100% in ~20 generations (about
16 h) (Liu et al,2023) or 60 generations (around two days) (Farzadfard
et al,2021). Additionally, a recent study screened for new retrons and
identiﬁed several that outperform Eco1 in efﬁciency (Khan et al,2024).
This research highlights signiﬁcant diversity in msDNA production and
editing rates among retrons. These editors exceed those used in previous
studies, achieving precise editing rates of up to 40% in human cells.
Researchers are also working to modify ncRNAs to improve editing
efﬁciency. They have explored how donor DNA homology arm length,
msDNA secondary structure, and the strength of retron operon
expression inﬂuence editing efﬁciency. Their ﬁndings show that
optimizing these factors and increasing msDNA expression can
signiﬁcantly enhance editing efﬁciency (Bhattarai-Kline et al,2022;L i u
et al,2023; Lopez et al,2022; Schubert et al,2021). Interestingly, they
revealed a surprising effect of plasmid copy number on editing
efﬁciency. When msDNA was expressed with different plasmids-p15A
(5– 10 copies), pBR322 (20– 40 copies), pUC (400– 600 copies), the
editing efﬁciency varied after 20 generations (16 h) of retron system
induction. The highest efﬁciency (29%) was observed with the lowest
copy number plasmid (p15A), while it dropped to 13% with pBR322
and further down to 7% with the high copy number pUC plasmid (Liu
et al, 2023). This suggests that unknown factors, beyond just the
intensity of msDNA expression, signiﬁcantly impact editing efﬁciency.
Results and discussion
Construction and evaluation of a retron editing system
We constructed a retron editing system using a plasmid derived
from the p15A origin of replication. The retron operon, consisting
of msr, msd,a n dret genes, was placed under a strong constitutive
promoter (J23119) and co-expressed with the CspRecT protein
coding sequence to enhance editing efﬁciency (Schubert et al,2021)
(Fig. EV1A). The msDNA programmable region was modiﬁed with
92 bp homologous sequences targeting either strand of lacZ,
denoted as PSlacZ-anti and PSlacZ in Fig. EV1A,B, respectively
(where PS stands for partial sequence). Appendix Figs. S1, S2
provide additional details on the speci ﬁc locations of these
modiﬁcations. These 92 bp homologous sequences carry mutations
that, upon successful editing, alter the codons for tryptophan and
glutamate at positions 17 and 18 of the LacZ protein, converting
TGG and GAA to termination codons (TGA and TAA). Colonies
with successfully edited lacZ gene will appear white on LB plates
containing IPTG and X-Gal.
We evaluated the retron editing system inE. coli strains with
varying mismatch repair deﬁciencies (MG1655, ΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ,
ΔmutSrecJsbcB ), each harboring either the p15AlacZ or p15AlacZ-
anti plasmid. The editing ef ﬁciency was minimal in all strains
expressing msDNA-PS lacZ-anti (matching the leading strand).
Conversely, msDNA-PSlacZ (matching the lagging strand) demon-
strated increasing editing efﬁciency, reaching nearly 100% in the
ΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ strain (Fig. EV1B). Sanger sequencing
conﬁrmed successful editing in theΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ strain
(Fig. EV1C). Our results demonstrate that msDNA efﬁciently edits
the target gene only when the homologous sequence matches the
lagging strand of genomic DNA replication, not the leading strand.
To investigate the effect of plasmid copy number on editing
efﬁciency, we inserted the retron operon encoding msDNA-PSlacZ
into two newly constructed plasmids: pSC101 (low copy) and pUC
(high copy), naming them pSClacZ and pUClacZ, respectively
(Fig. 1A; Appendix Figs. S3 – S4). The previously constructed
p15AlacZ plasmid (medium copy) was also included for compar-
ison. The ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was transformed with each of the
above plasmids, and the editing efﬁciencies were recorded every 2 h
from 2 h to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, each strain exhibits a
different editing ef
ﬁciency. The editing efﬁciency ofΔmutSrecJsbcB -
p15AlacZ approached 100% after 12 h of incubation. The editing
efﬁciency ofΔmutSrecJsbcB -pSClacZ continued to increase with the
extension of incubation time, reaching more than 90% after 24 h.
However, the strain with a high-copy plasmid ( ΔmutSrecJsbcB -
pUClacZ) had the lowest editing ef ﬁciency, with the highest
efﬁciency not exceeding 20% after 24 h of incubation (Fig.1B). We
then quantiﬁed plasmid and msDNA abundance at a stable editing
time point. The results showed that plasmid copy numbers
increased from pSClacZ (6) to p15AlacZ (50) to pUClacZ (420).
Correspondingly, the msDNA copy numbers in these strains were
3, 155, and 340, respectively (Fig.1C). These ﬁndings suggest that
although msDNA production increases with plasmid copy number,
it does not directly correlate with editing efﬁciency.
The presence of plasmidmsd reduced genomic DNA
editing efﬁciency
To understand the reduced editing ef ﬁciency observed in the
ΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUClacZ strain, we considered the mechanism of the
retron editing system. We noted that msDNA is synthesized using the
retron operon as a template. This situation could create potential
competition within the cell, as the synthesized msDNA could target two
locations: (1) themsd sequence located in the retron operon on the
plasmid, which is the template sequence used for msDNA synthesis and
(2) the genomic DNA, which serves as the target for genome editing.
Therefore, during the editing process, the plasmid-based templatemsd
might compete with the genomic DNA for binding to the msDNA
(Fig. 2A). If this competition exists, increasing the plasmid copy number
would lead to moremsd competing with the genomic target. This would
reduce the amount of msDNA available for editing the genomic DNA,
ultimately reducing the editing efﬁciency.
To demonstrate that additional homologous sequences on the
plasmid can reduce editing efﬁciency, we inserted another copy of
the 92 bplacZ sequence into plasmid p15AlacZ, creating p15AlacZ-
lacZ (Fig. 2B; Appendix Fig. S5). This sequence is identical to the

WT lacZ in the genome but differs by 2 bp from thelacZ sequence
within the retron operon. This introduces another homologous
target (Target 3 in Fig.3B) that can compete with the genomiclacZ
for binding to msDNA. We continuously monitored the editing
efﬁciency and observed that, starting from 12 h, the editing
efﬁciency of ΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ-lacZ was signiﬁcantly lower
compared to ΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ (Fig. 2C). Next, we diluted
a n dp l a t e dt h eΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ-lacZ strain cultured for
24 h. Randomly selected colonies were then used for plasmid
extraction and sequencing. The sequencing results conﬁrmed that
t h eG Gs e q u e n c ei nt h elacZ region on the plasmid (target 3)
mutated to AT (Fig. 2D). This demonstrates that the 92 bplacZ
sequence on the plasmid was inde e de d i t e db ym s D N A ,a n di t s
presence reduces the ef ﬁciency of retron editing, likely due to
competition between the plasmid-based sequences and the genomic
DNA target locus for binding to the msDNA.
Verifying msDNA recombination into plasmidmsd with a
dual plasmid system
To investigate msDNA editing the plasmid ’s msd region, we
constructed a two-plasmid system. Both plasmids, derived from
pBR and p15A origins, contained the retron operon. We inserted a
92 bp sequence from the kanamycin resistance gene (kanR)i n t ot h e
msd region of each plasmid. These plasmids, named pBR-PkanX
and p15A-PkanY, share high homology (90 bp) within thekanR
sequence of theirmsd r e g i o n s ,b u td i f f e rb yo n l yt w os p e c iﬁcb a s e s :
T-T in pBR-PkanX and G-A in p15A-PkanY (Fig.3A; Appendix
Figs. S6, S7). We hypothesized that msDNA-kanX generated from
pBR-PkanX would serve as a template to edit themsd region of
p15A-PkanY, speci ﬁcally mutating the G-A sequence to T-T.
Conversely, msDNA-kanY generated from p15A-PkanY would edit
the msd region of pBR-PkanX, changing the T-T sequence to G-A
(Fig. 3B). However, achieving complete editing (100%) of all
plasmid copies in a bacterial cell is challenging due to the presence
of multiple plasmid copies. Therefore, we anticipate observing
double peaks during sequencing at the mutation sites within the
msd region. This pattern of double peaks would be indicative of
successful editing within themsd region. One peak would represent
the original unedited sequence, while the other peak would
represent the incorporated msDNA sequence containing the two-
base difference.
The ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was co-transformed with pBR-PkanX
and p15A-PkanY plasmids. After a 24-hour incubation to facilitate

plasmid replication and msd editing, the transformed cells were
diluted and spread onto LB agar plates containing streptomycin
and chloramphenicol. Only those transformed cells harboring both
plasmids were able to survive due to antibiotic resistance. We
ampliﬁed themsd regions of the plasmids by PCR from the colonies
of strain 1, using upstream primers located in the sm
R and cmR gene
regions, respectively, along with a downstream primer in the ret
gene region (see Reagents and tools table). This design ensured that
only one plasmid served as the template for PCR ampliﬁcation.
Sequencing of the PCR product revealed a double peak at the 2 bp
mutation site, indicating that the msd of the plasmid was
successfully edited by msDNA (Fig.3B).
To conﬁrm thatmsd editing originated from the msDNA of the
other plasmid, we constructed control plasmids lacking a functional
retron promoter. We deleted the retron promoter in pBR-PkanX
and p15A-PkanY, resulting in pBR-ØkanX and p15A-ØkanY
plasmids, respectively (Fig. 3A; Appendix Figs. S8, S9). We
hypothesized that with an inactive retron operon, msd editing
would not occur. The ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was co-transformed
with three different plasmid combinations: pBR-ØkanX with p15A-
PkanY, pBR-PkanX with p15A-ØkanY, and pBR-ØkanX with
p15A-ØkanY. This process resulted in the generation of three
separate strains, designated as strains 2, 3, and 4, respectively
(Fig. 3C). Subsequently, the msd r e g i o n si na l lt h r e es t r a i n sw e r e
sequenced to analyze potential editing events. For strain 2,
sequencing shows a doublet in the msd region of pBR-ØkanX,
but a singlet with unaltered bases in p15A-PkanY (Fig.3C). For
strain 3, sequencing shows a singlet with unchanged bases in the
msd region of pBR-PkanX, but a doublet in p15A-ØkanY (Fig.3C).
For strain 4, sequencing shows a singlet with unchanged bases in

the msd regions of both plasmids (Fig. 3C). The above results
demonstrate that msDNA synthesized by an active retron operon
can edit msd on the plasmid.
Effects of msd positioning and enhanced retron system
on editing efﬁciency
Because the homologous sequence in msDNA has a stronger
editing ability when it is consistent with the lagging strand
sequence of the replication fork (Ellis et al,2001; Gallagher et al,
2014;H u e ne ta l ,2006), we hypothesized that msDNA-PSlacZ
could act as both the lagging strand during genomic DNA
replication and pUClacZ plasmid replication. This suggests that
msDNA-PSlacZ might be intensively used for editing of the pUC
plasmid’s msd, depleting the pool of msDNA available for editing
the genomic lacZ target, and thus reducing its editing efﬁciency
(Fig. 4A).
To address this potential competition, we took advantage of the
ﬁxed replication start site (ori) and termination site (ter)i nt h e
pUC plasmid. We strategically relocated the msd to a different
position on the plasmid, across theter boundary. This relocation
would alter the role of msDNA-PSlacZ during replication. Instead
of acting as the lagging strand, msDNA-PSlacZ would act as the
leading strand, preventing it from editing themsd once it moves
across the ter boundary. The pUC plasmid, which replicates via the
ColE1-based ori in a theta (θ) fashion (Lilly and Camps,2015), has
an unclear exact ter location, though it is believed that ColE1
plasmids replicate at different rates on either side of theori (Lovett
et al, 1974; Viguera et al, 1996) .B a s e do nt h i su n c e r t a i n t y ,w e
relocated themsd position on the plasmid clockwise by 991 bp from
its original position while keeping the plasmid size unchanged,
resulting in the creation of the pUClacZ1 plasmid (Fig. 4B;
Appendix Fig. S10). Compared to ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ, the
editing efﬁciency of ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ1 increased from 5%
at 2 h to ~70% after 24 h (Fig.4C), demonstrating the efﬁcacy of
msd relocation for enhanced editing efﬁciency.
To further increase this efﬁciency, we repositioned the msd an
additional 827 bp clockwise, creating the pUClacZ2 plasmid
(Fig. 4D; Appendix Fig. S11). This adjustment signi ﬁcantly
enhanced genomic lacZ
editing ef ﬁciency, with the ΔmutS-
recJsbcB-pUClacZ2 achieving over 80% editing within just 2 h
and nearly 100% after 6 h (Fig.4E). But, after 18 h, the efﬁciency
temporarily dropped to 70% before recovering to nearly 100% by
22 h (Fig.4E). The substantial increase in editing efﬁciency in the
ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ2 strain suggests that theter site lies within
the 827 bp range and that this repositioning shifted the msDNA-
PSlacZ from the lagging to the leading strand. This reducedmsd
editing on the plasmid while enhancing genomiclacZ editing. In
addition, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in the growth rate of
the ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ2 strain (Fig. 4E). We hypothesized
that this decrease may be due to reduced plasmid stability, leading
to a signiﬁcant loss of plasmids. This loss could result in a sharp
decrease in the number of antibiotic-resistant colonies, contribut-
ing to the observed decrease in growth rate.
To address these issues, we constructed the pUClacZ3 plasmid
by reversing the orientation of theori (Fig. 4F; Appendix Fig. S12).
Given the unequal replication rates on either side of the ori, we
hypothesized that this reversal would shift theter position by 180
degrees, transitioning msDNA from the lagging strand to the
leading strand. As anticipated, ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ3 main-
tained high genomic editing ef ﬁciency and excellent stability
without negatively impacting bacterial growth (Fig. 4G). These
ﬁndings underscore the importance of minimizingmsd editing to
enhance genomic editing efﬁciency. Our experiments demonstrate
that reducing msd editing is a powerful strategy for improving gene
editing outcomes.
To demonstrate the versatility of the improved retron system, we
applied it to new targets in the E. coli genome. Two genes, ung
(involved in DNA repair) andbetI (choline metabolism), located on
opposite sides of the genomicori, were chosen for testing. We replaced
the lacZ homologous sequence in pUClacZ3 with the corresponding
homologous sequences of ung and betI (Appendix Figs. S13, S14),
using retron editing to introduce two-point mutation inung and one
base pair deletion inbetI (Fig. EV2A,B). Sequencing results revealed
successful editing for both genes within 2 h of liquid culture
(Fig. EV2C). This demonstrates the broad applicability of our system
for targeting various genome genes for editing.
In this study, we investigated how varying the number of
msDNA template sequences (msd) affects genome editing efﬁciency
in E. coli, a model prokaryotic strain. While increasing the copy
number of msd enhanced msDNA expression, it also led to
unwanted competition, ulti mately reducing editing ef ﬁciency. In
conventional ssDNA-mediated gene editing, ssDNA is introduced
into the cell via electroporation without requiring intracellular
template synthesis. In contrast, retron editing synthesizes ssDNA
within the cell using msd as a template. This introduces
competition, which is absent in traditional ssDNA methods.
Despite increasing interest in retron technology, prior studies have
overlooked this competition issue. Our study is theﬁrst to identify
and conﬁrm msd editing by msDNA, and we propose a novel
method to reduce this competition, signiﬁcantly enhancing target
gene editing efﬁciency.
Retrons have gained signiﬁcant interest for their potential as
powerful in vivo DNA writing tools, exempli ﬁed by SCRIBE

(A) A schematic diagram illustrates four plasmids: pBR-PkanX, p15A-PKanY, pBR-ØkanX, and p15A-ØKanY. Each plasmid contains a 92 bp fragment within its msd region
homologous to the kanamycin resistance gene (green line). Notably, these homologous sequences share a high degree of similarity (90 bp), differing by only two speciﬁc
base pairs: “T-T” in pBR-PkanX and“G-A” in pBR-PkanY. Green and purple stars indicate mutation sites. Plasmids pBR-PkanX and p15A-PKanY possess theJ23119
promoter, enabling retron operon transcription and subsequent msDNA expression. In contrast, theJ23119 promoter is absent in pBR-ØkanX and p15A-ØKanY, preventing
retron operon transcription and msDNA production. The detailed sequences of the plasmids are provided in Appendix Figs. S6–S9. (B) TheΔmutSrecJsbcB strain harboring
two plasmids, pBR-PkanX and p15A-PKanY (strain 1), was constructed. The msDNA produced by each plasmid can edit the homologous sequence within themsd gene of
the other plasmid. Sequencing results of the targetedmsd gene region are provided. (C) Schematic diagrams illustrate strains 2, 3, and 4, each carrying different plasmid
combinations, as shown in theﬁgure. Sequencing data of the targetedmsd gene regions from these strains reveal mutations introduced through editing, denoted by red
letters.

(Farzadfard and Lu, 2014;L e a re ta l ,2023). However, a major
challenge for SCRIBE is its slow writing speed. Only one in 10,000
E. coli cells integrates the desired edit per generation (Farzadfard
and Lu, 2014), and even the improved HiSCRIBE version requires
~60 generations (2 days) for complete writing (Farzadfard et al,
2021). This slow writing speed arises from the inefﬁciency of the
editing process. Because relativelyfew cells successfully incorporate
the desired mutation in each generation, many cell divisions are
required before the edited population becomes a signi ﬁcant
proportion of the overall culture. This limitation hinders SCRIBE’s
ability to record rapid environmental changes. Theoretically, with

100% efﬁciency of msDNA integration at the replication fork, after
one round of replication, the DNA would form 2 double strands,
with no pure mutants yet. Following a second round, there would
be 4 double strands and 1 pure mutant. By extension, after six
rounds, there would be 64 double strands and 57 pure mutants. In
other words, the theoretical maximum mutation rate after six
rounds of replication (~6 generations) is approximately 89%. In our
work, we were able to achieve over 80% ef ﬁciency in editing
bacteria within ~6 generations (2 h). It suggests that the method is
approaching its theoretical limit. This dramatic increase in writing
speed paves the way for real-time recording of dynamic environ-
mental changes using retron systems, opening exciting possibilities
for environmental monitoring and synthetic biology applications.
In applying these conclusions to plasmids with various
replication origins, it’s crucial to note thatmsd-induced competi-
tion is more signi ﬁcant in high-copy plasmids compared to
medium- and low-copy ones. To reduce this competition in high
copy number plasmids, we propose two strategies: (1) adjusting the
relative position of msd on the plasmid and (2) reversing the
orientation of the plasmid replicon. For plasmids with a theta
replication mechanism that repl icates at the same rate in both
directions, the ﬁrst strategy is effective, while the second is not.
However, the ﬁrst approach may carry potential risks, such as
altered msDNA production or re duced plasmid stability. In
contrast, both strategies are effective for plasmids that replicate at
different rates in each direction. In these cases, we prefer the second
method, as it reduces competition while minimizing the impact on
plasmid stability and preserving the operon’sf u n c t i o n .
The successful application of t he retron editing system in
various organisms, including yeast (Gonzalez-Delgado et al,2024;
Sharon et al,2018), mammalian cells (Kong et al,2021; Lopez et al,
2022;Z h a oe ta l ,2022), and plants (Jiang et al, 2022), has
highlighted a potential issue: the competition between msd and
genomic DNA targets within eukaryotic cells. Unlike bacteria,
eukaryotes utilize the retron system in conjunction with CRISPR-
Cas9 tools, which create double-strand breaks (DSBs) in genomic
DNA. Here, msDNA plays a crucial role in repairing DSBs by
providing a template for DNA polymerase to ﬁll the gap and
integrate the desired edits, a process known as homology-directed
repair (HDR) (Sharon et al, 2018;Z h a oe ta l ,2022). To express
msDNA in eukaryotic systems, retrons are typically integrated into
shuttle plasmids, viral vectors, or directly into the host genome,
r e s u l t i n gi nm u l t i p l eo rs i n g l ec o p i e so fmsd within the cell. Studies
in yeast have shown that ssDNA can participate in DNA replication
as the lagging strand during plasmid replication, similar to the
process observed in prokaryotes (Barbieri et al,2017). This suggests
that msDNA could potentially target originating plasmids or viral
vectors and participate in their replication process. Such self-
targeting may reduce the pool of msDNA available for effective
HDR, thereby decreasing the overall ef ﬁciency of the editing
process. Supporting this notion, a study by Zhao et al observed a
discrepancy between msDNA abundance and editing efﬁciency in
different retron systems. While Retron Sa163 from
Stigmatella
aurantiaca generated the most msDNA, it exhibited a lower HDR
rate compared to Eco1 (Zhao et al, 2022). Furthermore, certain
retron editing systems that demonstrate high ef ﬁciency in
prokaryotes do not yield similar results in eukaryotic cells (Khan
et al,2024; Lopez et al,2022). We believe this difference arises from
variations in editing mechanisms. In prokaryotes, msDNA is
utilized during DNA replication for editing, whereas in eukaryotes,
it serves as a template for repair during the HDR process following
DSBs. Therefore, in addition to the competitive mechanisms
revealed in this study, we speculate that another signiﬁcant factor
limiting the ef ﬁciency of retron editing in eukaryotes is the
inefﬁciency of HDR.

Plasmid construction
We constructed plasmids using pFF745 as the parent vector
(Farzadfard and Lu,2014). Primer pairs used for plasmid construction
were synthesized from Tianyi Huiyuan (Wuhan, Hubei, China) (see
Reagents and tools table). All plasmids generated in this study were
assembled using the Hieff Clone Plus multi-one-step cloning kit
(Yeasen, Shanghai, China) and conﬁrmed by sequencing (Quintarabio,
Wuhan, Hubei, China). The constructed plasmids were transformed
into bacterial cells using the calcium chloride (CaCl
2) method to
generate corresponding derivative strains. Plasmids and their sequence
are shown in the Appendix.
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
E. coli DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. ΔmutS,
ΔmutSrecJ, and ΔmutSrecJsbcB strains were generated via the
CRISPR-Cas9 System (Jiang et al,2015). All strains were grown in
LB medium (containing 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g
NaCl per liter) at 37 °C supplemented with chloramphenicol
(15 μg/mL) or spectinomycin (20μg/mL) when necessary.
Editing efﬁciency quantiﬁcation
We used blue-white screening to quantify gene editing efﬁciency.
Approximately 200 ng of the plasmid of interest was added to 100μL
of competentΔmutSrecJsbcB cells. The mixture was incubated on ice
for 30 min, followed by a heat shock at 42 °C for 90 s. Afterward, the
cells were placed on ice for an additional 2 min. To promote cell
recovery, 900μL of pre-warmed LB medium was added, and the
suspension was incubated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) for one
hour. Following recovery, 1 mL of culture was transferred to fresh LB
medium (50 mL) containing chloramphenicol (50μg/mL) and incu-
bated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) until reaching the desired time
point. The culture was then diluted and plated onto LB agar containing
IPTG, X-gal, and chloramphenicol. After overnight incubation at
37 °C, white and blue colonies were counted, and editing efﬁciency was
calculated as the percentage of white colonies relative to the total
number of colonies.
We categorized the bacteria into three groups based on their
editing status: Group 1 consists of fully edited bacteria, which are
completely edited in the liquid medium, resulting in colonies that
contain 100% non-functional lacZ and appear as white colonies.
Group 2 includes partially editedbacteria that are unedited in the
liquid medium but undergo editing while grown on a solid
medium, causing these colonies to exhibit a slight blue color due to
the presence of unedited bacter ia. Group 3 comprises unedited
bacteria, which retain functionallacZ and thus form blue colonies
due to X-gal hydrolysis. In our analysis, we recognized only theﬁrst
group of bacteria as edited.
Determination of plasmid and msDNA copy numbers
To estimate plasmid and msDNA copy numbers, we employed
Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) following a cell lysis step.
Brieﬂy, 100 μL of logarithmically growing cells were lysed by
boiling for 10 min. Lysates containing genomic DNA, plasmid
DNA, and msDNA were stored at −20 °C until further analysis
(Lopez et al,2022).
Three sets of primers were used for qRT-PCR: (1) tdk-qPCR
primers: These primers (tdk-qPCR-F and tdk-qPCR-R) amplify
genomic DNA and generate a cycle threshold (Ct) value called C
tg.
(2) ret-qPCR primers: These primers (ret-qPCR-F and ret-qPCR-R)
amplify plasmid DNA, producing a Ct value named Ctp. (3) msd-qPCR
primers: This primer set (msd-qPCR-F and msd-qPCR-R) targets the
msr/msd region, amplifying the corresponding sequences on msDNA
and plasmids. This ampliﬁcation generates a Ct value called C
tm.
The plasmid and msDNA copy numbers were estimated using
qRT-PCR data by comparing the Ct values from genomic, plasmid,
EMBO reports Yuyang Ni et al
5326 EMBO reports Volume 25 | December 2024 | 5316– 5330 © The Author(s)
and msDNA sequences. The formulas used account for the
differences in ampliﬁcation of these DNA types.
The plasmid copy number was estimated using the formula:
plasmid copy number¼ 2/C0 ΔCt ¼ 2ðCtg/C0 CtpÞ
This formula estimates how many more plasmid copies exist
relative to the genomic DNA.
The msDNA copy number was estimated using the following
formula:
msDNA copy number¼ 2ðCtg/C0 CtmÞ /C0 plasmid copy number:
This formula ﬁrst estimates the total number of copies
containing the msDNA sequence (which could be present on both
plasmids and msDNA molecules). By subtracting the plasmid copy
number (which also contains the msr/msd sequence), the msDNA
copy number is isolated.
The copy numbers are relative estimates, assuming that the
genomic DNA region has a copy number of 1. Due to potential
differences in PCR ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies between primers, these
estimates are not absolute. Variations in ampliﬁcation can affect the
Ct values, so the plasmid and msDNA copy numbers should be
interpreted as relative rather than precise measurements.
qRT-PCR was done on a Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. Each
reaction included: 10 μLH i e f f® qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix,
1 μLe a c ho ff o r w a r da n dr e v e r s ep r i m e r s( 0 . 5μM ﬁnal concentra-
tion), 0.4μL template DNA, nuclease-free water to aﬁnal volume of
20 μL. Thermal cycling conditions were: pre-denaturation at 95 °C
for 4 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s (repeated 40 cycles),
annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s (during which
ﬂuorescence was measured). Melting curve analysis was done after
40 cycles to assess amplicon speciﬁcity. Ampliﬁcation curves and
melting curves were generated using CFX Maestro software 2.3
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, TX, USA). For each strain or control
condition, three clones were used as biological replicates, with each
sample run in triplicate wells for technical replication.

Figure EV1. Schematic representation of the retron operon and msDNA-mediated genomiclacZ editing process.
(A) Top panel: The retron operon is represented by double-stranded DNA labeled as the coding strand and template strand, respectively. A strong constitutive promoter,
J23119 (black arrow), drives transcription of the operon, which encodes msDNA (msr/msd), reverse transcriptase (ret), and CspRecT (recT). The coding regions ofmsr and
msd are depicted as blue and gray rectangles, respectively. A segment within themsd coding region (gray rectangle), which shares signiﬁcant sequence similarity with the
genomic lacZ gene, is denoted as the PSlacZ-anti coding sequence (PS stands for partial sequence). The blue line aligns with thelacZ coding strand, while the red line
represents its reverse complement. The mutation sequence is indicated by a yellow star. Transcription and reverse transcription produce msDNA, a hybrid of msr RNA
(light blue) and cDNA (black). The msDNA incorporateslacZ homologous sequences, designated PSlacZ-anti (red).E. coligenomic DNA and plasmid are shown as double-
stranded structures. The genomicori and ter are marked in blue and yellow, respectively. ThelacZ gene and its transcription direction are indicated by a purple arrow.
During E. coligenomic DNA replication, msDNA (red lines) integrates into the single-stranded DNA region at the replication fork through base pairing. Notably, msDNA-
PSlacZ-anti has the same sequence as the leading strand. The detailed sequence of the plasmid is provided in Appendix Fig. S1. Bottom panel: The retronoperon expresses
msDNA-PSlacZ, which incorporateslacZ homologous sequences designated PSlacZ (blue). Importantly, PSlacZ is the reverse complement of PSlacZ-anti. PSlacZ shares
the same sequence as the lagging strand. (B) Effect of strain and editing template on genomiclacZ gene editing efﬁciency at 24 h of incubation. We compared the editing
efﬁciency in WT (no mutation control),ΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ, andΔmutSrecJsbcB strains expressing msDNA-PSlacZ-anti or msDNA-PSlacZ. The data are presented as a bar
graph, with each bar representing the mean, and error bars indicating the standard deviation. Each data point represents an individual biological replicate (n = 4).
Statistically signiﬁcant differences were determined using an unpaired Student’s t-test. Thep value for the comparison of the editing efﬁciency between msDNA-PSlacZ-
anti and msDNA-PSlacZ was 0.002714 in strain MG1655. In theΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ, andΔmutSrecJsbcB strains, thep value for this comparison was <0.000001. **P < 0.005,
****P < 0.0001. (C) Sequencing results of the genomiclacZ sequence of the target region. Mutations change the codons for tryptophan and glutamate at positions 17 and
18 of the LacZ protein from TGG and GAA to stop codons (TGA and TAA). Red letters represent mutated bases. Source data are available online for thisﬁgure.

Figure EV2. Genomic ung and betI gene editing inΔmutSrecJsbcB strains harboring pUCung or pUCbetI plasmids, respectively.
(A) A 92 bp homologous sequence of theung gene (PSung coding sequence) was inserted into themsd region. The msDNA-PSung, aligning with the genomic DNA lagging
strand, mediatesung gene editing, resulting in double base mutations. Notably, the msDNA-PSung aligns with the pUCung plasmid’s leading strand, preventingmsd editing.
The detailed sequence of the plasmid is provided in Appendix Fig. S13. (B) A 92 bp homologous sequence of thebetI gene (PSbetI coding sequence) was inserted into the
msd region. The msDNA-PSbetI, aligning with the genomic DNA lagging strand, mediatesbetI gene editing, resulting in one base deletion. Notably, the msDNA-PSbetI
aligns with the pUCbetI plasmid’s leading strand, preventingmsd editing. The detailed sequence of the plasmid is provided in Appendix Fig. S14. (C) Sequencing results of
the targeted region in the genomicung and betI genes. Four colonies were randomly selected from each plate, and these colonies were pooled separately for each strain
(one pool forΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUCung and one pool forΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUCbetI) to increase the number of cells analyzed for mutations. The regions surrounding the
targeted sequences in the genomicung and betI genes were separately ampliﬁed by PCR for each pool, followed by DNA sequencing. The DNA sequencing results reﬂect
the average editing efﬁciency within each pool. If editing is highly efﬁcient (close to 100%), we expect to see a dominant peak corresponding to the mutated sequence,
with a very small or undetectable peak for the wild-type sequence. Conversely, lower editing efﬁciency will result in a mixture of peaks, representing both mutated and
wild-type sequences. Mutated bases are indicated in red.
