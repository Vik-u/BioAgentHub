ABSTRACT
Precision genome editing technologies have trans-
formed modern biology. These technologies have
arisen from the redirection of natural biological ma-
chinery, such as bacteriophage lambda proteins for
recombineering and CRISPR nucleases for eliciting
site-speciﬁc double-strand breaks. Less well-known
is a widely distributed class of bacterial retroele-
ments, retrons, that employ specialized reverse tran-
scriptases to produce noncoding intracellular DNAs.
Retrons’ natural function and mechanism of genetic
transmission have remained enigmatic. However, re-
cent studies have harnessed their ability to produce
DNA
in situ for genome editing and evolution. This
review describes retron biology and function in both
natural and synthetic contexts. We also highlight
areas that require further study to advance retron-
based precision genome editing platforms.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to precisely edit genomic loci has been a long-
standing goal of biotechnology. Targeted genome editing
is being exploited to probe genotype-phenotype relation-
ships, repair disease-causing alleles, develop designer or-
ganisms with modified genomes, and to biologically record
intra- and extracellular conditions. Classically, strain im-
provement has been achieved either via non-specific mu-
tagenesis of genomes (1,2) or via targeted modifications
of specific genes expressed on plasmids (3,4). Recombi-
neering (5) and CRISPR-based genome editing (6,7)h a v e
dramatically increased the ease and throughput of tar-
geting individual genomic loci. Multiplexing and iterating
recombineering- and CRISPR-based editing technologies
have enabled high-throughput exploration of genotype–
phenotype relationships and continuous evolution of syn-
theticgenomeswithnovelproperties,forexampleinMulti-
plexAutomatedGenomeEngineering(‘MAGE’)( 8),Yeast

erative CRISPR EnAbled Trackable genome Engineering
(‘iCREATE’) (10).
Retronsareapotentiallyusefultoolfortargetedgenomic
engineering because they produce intracellular DNAs
via reverse transcription of noncoding structural RNAs
(11,12). While the natural biology of these widespread
retroelements is largely unknown, retrons have recently
been repurposed asinsitu sources of donor DNA for both
recombineering- and CRISPR-based genome editing ap-
plications (13–15). This production of intracellular DNA
has so far enabled recording of cellular states (13), high-
throughputgeneticediting( 14),andtargetedgenomemuta-
tion(15).Here,wereviewretronbiologyandretron-enabled
genome engineering applications. We conclude with a dis-
cussion of future prospects and challenges in retron-based
genome editing.
RETRON BIOLOGY
Retron discovery and biochemistry
Retrons were initially discovered in 1984 from the presence
of short satellite RNA–DNA molecules in bacterial DNA
preparations (16). Gel electrophoresis of phenol-extracted
chromosomal DNA fromMyxobacteria xanthusand Stig-
matellaaurantica indicated a secondary satellite band with
a mobility of∼120–190 base pairs (bp) (16). Subsequent
studies revealed that these bands, termed multicopy single-
stranded DNAs (msDNAs), are comprised of one strand
of structured RNA, the ‘msr,’ connected to one strand of
DNA, the ‘msd.’ The msr and msd molecules are joined by

Figure 1. Retron structure and organization. (A) Retrons are encoded as
a single polycistronic transcriptional cassette containing a promoter, an
msr (blue) including a conserved priming guanosine residue (green), an
msd (red), self-complementary regions (yellow), and a reverse transcrip-
tase (purple,not to scale)(12). The blackarrow shows the direction of the
coding strand for the retron cassette; the red arrow shows the direction
of reverse transcription. Inset: sequence logo of nucleotides adjacent to
the priming guanosine of 15 msr-msd sequences. Retron-Sen1 (Se72) was
excluded because its msr lacks an apparent priming guanosine (46). (B)
Structure of a representative msr-msd transcript encoded by Retron-Eco1

as the retron. The discovery of retron RTs was particularly
notable because they were the first discovered bacterially-
encoded RTs (17). In vitrostudies demonstrated thatEs-
cherichia coliretron RTs and their paired msrs were both
necessary and sufficient to produce msDNA with the char-
acteristic 2′-5′ linkage (18,19). To date, 38 distinct retrons
have been identified experimentally by their production of
msDNA; 16 of these, which we subsequently refer to as the
‘experimentally validated retrons’, contain fully annotated
and experimentally-validated msr-msd-RT cassettes. Table
1 summarizes all experimentally-characterized retrons re-
ported to date, along with their host organisms. Bioinfor-
matic approaches have also identified hundreds of puta-
tiveretronsthathavenotbeencharacterizedexperimentally
(20–22).
The rapid discovery of hundreds of putative retrons has
prompted us to develop a systematic naming convention
for these retroelements. Currently, retrons are named by
the first letters of their genus name, species name, and the
length of reverse-transcribed DNA in their native msDNA
sequence. This convention was initially developed by In-
ouyeetal. in1989,whotermedaretronisolatedfrom E.coli
that contained 86 bases of reverse-transcribed DNA ‘Ec86’
(23). However, this nomenclature is not easy to adapt for
large-scale,systematicretrondiscoveryforthreereasons:(i)
the length of the msd of most experimentally validated and
putative retrons is unknown; (ii) two letters are insufficient
to uniquely identify the genus and species of many retron-
encoding bacteria; and (iii) the convention does not distin-
guish the entire retron from the RT. Therefore, we propose
amoregeneralnamingconventionthatisadaptedfromthe
restriction enzyme literature (Table1)( 24).
I. Retrons are named as the first letter of their genus, first
two letters of their species, and an Arabic numeral cor-
responding to the order with which they were discov-
eredrelativetootherretronsfromthesamespeciesora
different species with the same first genus and first two
species letters, respectively.
II. The prefix ‘Retron-’ is added to signify that this object
is a retron, and the prefixes ‘RT-’, ‘msr’, ‘msd’ and ‘ms-
DNA’areaddedwhenreferringtothereversetranscrip-
tase enzyme, msr, msd and msDNA, respectively.
Under the new convention, ‘Ec86’ is re-named ‘Retron-
Eco1’ and the corresponding RT is ‘RT-Eco1.’ For clarity
and continuity, the rest of this review will use the new con-
vention and will also include the historical names in paren-
thesis (e.g. Retron-Eco1 (Ec86)).
Msr, msd and msDNA structure and production
Inallexperimentallyvalidatedretrons,themsrandmsdare
encoded within a single transcriptional cassette, with the
msr to the 5
′ of the msd (Figure1A). The retron msr-msd
transcriptional cassettes are divergent at the sequence level
but share substantial structural homology (Supplementary
Figure S1). The structural elements are likely necessary for
function. Prior to reverse transcription, the msr and msd
form a single highly structured transcript (Figure1B). The
msr structure contains 1–3 stable hairpins with∼7–10 bp-

long stems and∼3–10 nt loops (12,25). The msd-encoding
segment of the transcript is also highly structured, folding
intoasinglehairpinwithalong( ∼10–50bp)stemthatgen-
erally contains mismatched or wobble base pairs. In addi-
tion to this internal structure of the msr and msd, the∼8–
30 bases at the 5
′ end of the msr and the 3′ end of the msd
transcript are complementary and hybridize (Figure1B).
The internal (e.g. 3′) and of the msr portion of this stem
contains or ends immediately 5′ to the conserved guano-
sine residue that primes reverse transcription of the satel-
lite DNA. Most commonly, this guanosine is found within
a conserved TAGC sequence, though occasionally this se-
quence is CAGA (as in Retron-Eco2 (Ec67)), CAGC (as in
Retron-Sau1 (Sa163) and Retron-Mxa1 (Mx162)), GAGC
(as in Retron-Mxa2 (Mx65)) or ACGC (as in Retron-Vch2
(Vc81)) (Figure1A, inset).
The RT initiates reverse transcription using the base-
paired 5
′ and 3′ stem of the msr-msd as a primer (12).
Early experiments demonstrated that severalE.coli retron
RTs and their paired msrs are both necessary and suffi-
cient to produce msDNA with the characteristic 2′-5′ link-
age (18,19), and that the 2′-5′ linkage between the priming
guanosine in the msr and first base of the msd DNA is cat-
alyzed directly by the RT (26) .T h eR Te x t e n d st h er e v e r s e

tary reverse transcript and is thus be considered to be part
of both the msr and msd (27)( F i g u r e1C). The mechanism

mains unexplored.
Retron msDNA is further nucleolytically processed af-
ter reverse transcription (12,17,28,29). Often, some or all
of the msr upstream of the conserved priming guanosine
is degraded. For example, the Retron-Mxa1 (Mx162) ms-
DNA is initially transcribed as a 241 nucleotide (nt) tran-
script. In the mature msDNA, 16 residues are cleaved from
the 5
′ end, leaving a 71-nt msr and a 162-nt msd msDNA
(the msr and msd overlap at 8 bases) (17). Other retrons
undergo much more dramatic processing that results in a
maturemsDNAthatisprimarilyreversetranscribedDNA.
For example, msDNA-Eco4 (Ec83) is endonucleolytically
cleaved between the fourth and fifth nucleotides from the
primingguanosineresidue,removingthatlinkagetothemsr
(12,28).Thiscleavagelikelyresultsinthedissociationofthe
base pairs at the 3
′ ends of the msd and msr, since 90% of
experimentally-observedmsDNA-Eco4(Ec83)isnotjoined
to RNA (30). While the enzyme responsible for this cleav-
ageisnotknown,itmayarisefromaputativeATP-binding

some exceptions for highly homologous retrons (34,35).
Mutational and Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Ex-
ponential Enrichment (SELEX) -based studies of Retron-
Eco1 (Ec86) and Retron-Eco3 (Ec73) indicated that both
msrsequenceandsecondarystructureareimportantforRT
recognition. While RT-Eco1 (Ec86) can bind moderately
truncated or modified variants of its cognate msr, remov-
ing or destabilizing a core section containing an 8 bp stem
andathreebaseloopabrogatesbinding.Similarly,RT-Eco3
(Ec73) binds a specific 9 bp stem, three base loop section
of its cognate msr but fails to bind other msr truncations
(32,36).
Reverse transcriptase structure and function
Retron RTs form a diverse class within the broader fam-
ily of bacterial RTs (Figure2, Supplementary Figure S2).
Early estimates suggested that retrons encode 11–14% of
all bacterial RTs, second only to Group II intron mat-
urases (20,21). More recently, a metagenomic survey sug-
gestedthatdiversity-generatingretroelements(DGRs)may
bemorecommonthanretronsinuncultivatedbacteria( 37).
Nonetheless,retronRTsarequitecommonindiversebacte-
ria (see next section). Experimentally validated retron RTs
share just∼14% average amino acids (aa) homology with
theRoseburiaintestinalis Group II intron maturase RT do-
main, ∼12% with theBordetellabacteriophage DGRbRT
RT, and∼25% homology with each other (Supplementary
Table S1).
Phylogenetic analysis indicates several distinct groups of
retron RT sequences, which together form a group dis-
tinct from RTs associated with both Group II intron mat-
urases and DGRs (Figure2A). To identify the relation-
ship between retron RTs and other bacterial RTs we first
aligned the sequences of all 16 fully annotated retron RTs,
eight previously putatively identified retron RTs from tax-
onomic groups lacking experimentally validated retrons,
three Group II intron maturase RTs, and theBordetella
bacteriophage DGRbRT using NCBI’s Constraint-based
Multiple Alignment Tool (COBALT) (38). We then built a
phylogenetictreefromthesealignmentsusingtheGeneious
Tree Builder tool with the Jukes-Cantor genetic distance
model and the neighbor-joining tree build method. In the
resulting tree, retron RTs branch from the Group II intron
maturaseandDGRRTs.Notably,theputativeretronRTse-
quences, which originated from genomes of bacteria in the
Bacteroidetes,Betaproteobacteria,Cyanobacteria,Fusobac-
teria,a n dFirmicutes, and the archaeon Methanosarcina
acetivorans(39),andtheexperimentallyvalidatedretronRT
sequences, which originated only fromGammaproteobacte-
ria and Deltaproteobacteria, are clearly within this group
separate from other bacterial RTs. There are several clear
groupswithintheretronRTs.Onegroupcontainsthemyx-
ococcal RT-Mxa2 (Mx65), RT-Mxa1 (Mx162), RT-Nex2
(Ne144) and RT-Sau1 (Sa163) and putative cyanobacte-
rialretronRTsfrom Nostocpunctiforme andTrichodesmium
erythraeum. Another group contains RT-Vch1 (Vc95), RT-
Eco4 (Ec83), RT-Vpa3 (Vp96), and RT-Eco7 (Ec78). The
remaining RTs in this analysis do not fall into closely re-
lated groups.

(40). Most retron RTs are ∼300–400 aa long and lack
bioinformatically identifiable endonuclease, maturase, or
RNAse domains (Figure2C) (12,23). Several retron RTs

characteristic NAXXH motif seen in retron RTs. Deletion
ofregionXfromRT-Eco1(Ec86)andRT-Eco3(Ec73)does
not block RT-cognate msr binding, but abrogates synthesis
of the msDNA product, suggesting that it may be essential

RegionYisa ∼90aasegmentattheC-terminusofretron
RTs. Region Y is defined as beginning within motif 7 at
a highly conserved VTG triplet and extending to the C-
terminal end of the protein (12,32). Fourteen experimen-
tally verified retron RTs contain the VTG triplet; RT-Vch2
(Vc81)andRT-Eco6(Ec48)containaV →IandT →Hsub-
stitutions, respectively. Beyond the conserved VTG, region
Y is variable. Biochemical studies indicate that region Y
directs the RT to its cognate msr. Deleting region Y from
RT-Eco1 (Ec86) and RT-Eco3 (Ec73) abrogated their abil-
ity to bind their msrs (32). Moreover, a purified C-terminal
fragment of region Y of RT-Eco1 (Ec86) (residues 255–
320) bound the stem-loop of msr-Eco1 (Ec86) with aK
D
of ∼5 × 10−8 M, as well as a shorter fragment containing
aneightbase-pairstemofthemsr-Eco1(Ec86)withathree
base UUU loop, but not the msr-Eco3 (Ec73). Likewise, a
purified C-terminal fragment of RT-Eco3 (Ec73) contain-
ing its region Y (residues 251–311) bound the cognate msr-
Eco3 (Ec73) msr tightly (though the specificK
D was not
measured), but not msr-Eco1 (Ec86) msr (36). Swapping
region Ys between RT-Eco1 (Ec86) and RT-Eco3 (Ec73)
producedchimericproteinswith‘swapped’msrrecognition
(32). However, all region Y studies to date have focused on
Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) and Retron-Eco3 (Ec73). Additional
biochemical experiments will be required to confirm that
region Y broadly recognizes the stem of its cognate msr in
diverse retrons.
Accessory open reading frames in retron cassettes
Approximately a third of annotated retrons encode ac-
cessory open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown func-
tion (Figure 3A). These ORFs may be between the msr-
msd and the RT (e.g., in Retron-Eco3 (Ec73), Retron-Sen2
(St85), and Retron-Vch2 (Vc81)) or immediately 3
′ of the
RT (e.g. in Retron-Eco4 (Ec83)). Some of these ORFs are
putatively annotated as adenosine-binding proteins, (e.g.,
in Retron-Eco4 (Ec83) (43)) or cold-shock proteins (e.g. in
theS.enterica EnteridisRetron-Sen1(Se72))( 44).Notably,
some of the retrons with accessory ORFs also produce un-
usualmsDNAs.Forexample,Retron-Eco4(Ec83)produces
single-stranded DNA via site-specific cleavage of its ms-
DNA (45). Retron-Sen1 (Se72) shows an even more dra-
maticdeparturefromtheretronparadigm;the2
′-5′ linkage
isnotexperimentallyobserved( 44,46).Here,theRNAtem-
plateisdegradedafterthefirstroundofRT,andthesingle-
stranded DNA is used as a template to produce double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA). RT-Sen1 uses the free 3
′OH end
of the msr to initiate the second round of DNA synthe-
sis. Despite the unusual dsDNA product, RT-Sen1 (Se72)
isstructurallyhomologouswithotherretronRTsequences.
Althoughitistemptingtospeculatethatthepresenceofac-
cessory ORFs is important for producing unusual msDNA
variants, additional biochemical studies are required to de-
fine their functions. These enigmatic ORFs may also pro-
videopportunitiesforbasicdiscoveryandbiotechnological
applications.
Biological distribution and transmission
Experimental and bioinformatic studies indicate that
retrons are sporadically distributed throughout the bacte-
rial kingdom. Experimentally, msDNA has been isolated
from a diverse subset ofAlpha-, Delta- and Gammapro-
teobacteria(Table1)( 47). Screens of msDNA production,
however,havecommonlyindicatedthatmsDNAisnotcon-
sistently produced by all strains within these taxonomic
groups. Screens ofE. coliidentified msDNA in four of 89
andsevenof113clinicalandenvironmentalisolates( 48,49).
Another study identified msDNA from 4 of 23Proteus
mirabilisisolates;1of21 Klebsiellapneumoniae isolates,and
10of63 Rhizobiaisolates(49).Incontrast,msDNAproduc-
tion appears very common within the myxobacteria, with
msDNAfoundin27of28testedmyxobacterialstrains( 50).
In addition to these experimentally-identified retrons,
bioinformatic surveys have identified putative retrons
in Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes
(39), Actinobacteria (21,51) and even in the archaeon
Methanosarcina acetivorans(39). Typically, these studies
first identify retron-specific RTs in gene or protein data-
banks (20,21), metagenomic data (52,53), or in newly-
sequenced bacterial genomes (51,54). Recent studies have
additionally examined the regions upstream of the RT for
palindromic and hairpin-containing motifs similar to msr-
msd regions of experimentally validated retrons (55,56).

Figure 3. Organization and genomic context of select retron cassettes. (A) Structures of representative validated retron cassette genes. The msr (blue),
msd (red), complementary repeat regions (yellow), and RT (purple), and associated unknown ORFs (green) are indicated. Many retron cassettes (‘stan-
dard’) consist only of an msr and msd flanked by complementary regions upstream of an RT. Variations on this theme include ORFs either immediately
downstream of the RT or between the msr-msd and the RT. Retron-Sen1 (Se72) contains an msd that is transcribed in both directions to produce double-
stranded DNA. A hairpin-containing ORF flanked by repeat regions may function as an alternative msr. The cassette also includes an RT and a second
unknownORF with homology to cold shock proteins (46). (B) Genomic contexts of retron cassettes. Severalvalidated retrons occur in putative prophage
sites flanked by repeat regions (12). Retron-Sen2 (St85) occurs in what is thought to be an ancient prophage site downstream of the Sgi1 genomic island
associatedwithpathogenesis.Retron-Eco5(Ec107)replaces34basesofanintergeneticregionwithnoapparentmobileelementnearby.Retron-Sen1 (Se72)
occurs on a plasmid. (C) Several different retrons, along with additional orfs, may occupy the same locus in different bacterial strains or populations. For
example,theRetronEco1-(Ec86)andanupstreamORFoccupiesthesamegeneticsiteasRetron-Eco2(Ec67)indifferent E.coli strains(59,85).The Vibrio
choleraeretrons Retron-Vch1 (Vc95), Retron-Vch2 (Vc81) and Retron-Vch3 (Vc137) also occupy the same genetic site.
The sporadic distribution of retrons within prokary-
otic taxonomic groups and the mismatch in GC% con-
tent from their host strains suggest lateral transmission
(12). While retrons do not appear to encode elements
that support genetic mobility (e.g., RT endonuclease do-
mains such as those required for the mobility of Group
II introns), many are associated with mobile elements and
prophage insertion sites (Figure 3B) (12). For example,
Retron-Eco3 (Ec73) is inserted into a bacteriophage-like
element termed /H9272R73 integrated into the chromosomal
selenocystyl-tRNA locus. Infection of/H9272R73-containing E.
coli cells with P2 phage produced infectious virions that
lysogenized new host strains, resulting in the integration
of /H9272R73 at the selenocystyl-tRNA locus and production
of msDNA-Eco3 (Ec73) (57,58). Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) and
Retron-Eco2 (Ec67) both replace an identical∼180 bp be-
tween a phage cohesive end site and the terminator of
a DNA packaging gene (59)( F i g u r e3A). Retron-Sen1
(Se72)evenexistsonabacterialplasmid( 44).Retron-Nex1
(Ne160) contains several apparently duplicated repeats of
msr and msd sequences without an RT within a kilobase,
suggesting that this element may have been repeatedly du-
plicated and inserted by a distant RT or alternative ele-
ment (60). Other retrons, however, are not associated with
obvious prophage or other mobile elements. Retron-Eco5
(Ec107), for example, replaces a palindromic 34 bp in an
intergenic region that lacks any further characteristics of
mobility or prophage insertion. In addition to horizontal
transfer,manymyxococcalretrons,includingRetron-Mxa1
(Mx162)andRetron-Sau1(Sa163),clusterincloselyrelated
bacterial species and show a codon bias that is similar to
thatofthehost.Theseretronslikelyaroseorwereacquired
in a common ancestor of the myxobacteria and were verti-
cally inherited (50).
Hypothesized biological functions
Retrons’ functional role––if any––remains poorly under-
stood. Some retrons could potentially be purely selfish ge-
netic elements that are neutral or weakly deleterious to the
host. However, the observation that retrons encode func-
tional proteins suggests that they may be beneficial to the
host, possibly under specialized conditions (61). In the fol-
lowingparagraphs,wediscusstheretronswithknownfunc-
11014 NucleicAcidsResearch,2019,Vol.47,No.21
tions and consider potential roles for those whose function
remains unknown.
Circumstantial evidence suggests that some retrons may
playkeyrolesinpathogenesis.DisablingRetron-Sen2(St85)
or Retron-Eco4 (Ec83) by erasing their ability to produce
msDNA reduced the ability of their enteropathogenicS.
entericaTyphimurium andE.coli hosts to persistently col-
onize mouse intestine (62). Closer studies of the msDNA-
nullS.enterica Typhimurium cells indicated severe growth
defects in anaerobic conditions. Growth was rescued by
the addition of nitrate, a terminal electron acceptor typ-
ically present in aerobic environments. Proteome analysis
indicated differential expression of 238 proteins between
wild-type and msDNA-lacking S. entericaTyphimurium
under anaerobic conditions, most involved in the reduc-
tion of electron acceptors present in anaerobic environ-
ments. While the patterns of protein regulation did not fol-
low those associated with the major known regulatory pro-
teins in S. entericaTyphimurium, the authors concluded
that in some genetic or epigenetic way Retron-Sen2 (St85)
controls protein abundance that in turn enables the use of
the electron acceptors present in anaerobic environments.
Conversely, other studies found that deletion of RT-Sen2
(Se85) from other, multidrug-resistant strains ofS.enterica
Typhimurium increased virulence, suggesting an opposing
role in the regulation of virulence for this retron (63).
The apparent phylogenetic subgroup obtained from
aligning RTs that includes Retron-Sen2 (St85) and Retron-
Eco4 (Ec83) also contains retrons from other pathogenic
bacterial serovars, including Retron-Eco7 (Ec78), Retron-
Vch1 (Vc95), and Retron-Vpa3 (Vp96). The RTs associ-
ated with these retrons have relatively similar sequences,
with aa identity of∼40–58% (Supplementary Table S1).
Several also contain accessory ORFs between the msd
and RT or downstream of the RT ( 62,64–66)( F i g u r e
3A). Interestingly, the msrs of two retron pairs in this
group, msr-Vch1 (Vc95)/msr-Vpa1 (Vp96) and msr-Eco4
(Ec83)/msr-Eco7 (Ec78), share∼75% and∼60% sequence
identity (63). Correspondingly, RT-Vch1 (Vc95) and RT-
Eco4 (Ec83) recognize and reverse transcribe msr-msd-
Vpa3 (Vp96) and msr-msd-Eco7 (Ec78), respectively (35).
These are the only two examples where an RT can func-
tion on a non-cognate msr-msd. Moreover, Retron-Vch1
(Vc95) is almost exclusively found in the epidemic cholera-
causing serotypes (O1 and its derivative O139); this retron
is very rare in non-pathogenic serotypes (66). In contrast,
two non-pathogenic serotypes contain alternate retrons in
thesamegenomiclocus––Retron-Vch2(Vc81)andRetron-
Vch3 (Vc137). Retron-Vch2 (Vc81) is also oriented in the
oppositedirectionfromRetron-VchI(Vc95)( 64).Thepres-
ence of certain retron variants only in pathogenic species,
and the similarities between such retrons, has led to spec-
ulation that retrons may play a mechanistic role in patho-
genesis (35). Alternatively, the ORFs of unknown function
could themselves be pathogenicity determinants that asso-
ciate with retrons to hitchhike between genomes (Figure
3C).
Beyond potential roles in pathogenesis, retrons may play
adaptive roles in the utilization of non-traditional energy
sources. For example, expression of Retron-Eco5 (Ec107)
is strongly enhanced in cells that are starved for phos-
phate or entering stationary phase in rich media (67). Sim-
ilarly, Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) expression resulted in signifi-
cant downregulation of eight genes and upregulation of
one gene. The eight downregulated genes were important
in carbon utilization; the remaining gene upregulated the
production of the ribosomal protein S2 (65). Beyond non-
pathogenic E. coli, retrons are especially common in myx-
ococcal bacteria that undergo significant morphological
changes, forming multicellular-like, ‘fruiting’ bodies in re-
sponse to nutrient insufficiency, and show complex inter-
communitybehaviorandpredation( 68);perhapsretronsin
these species help enable these phenotypic changes. Addi-
tionalstudiesarerequiredtolinkretronexpressionandcell
specialization.
Whilethereareseveralhypothesesaboutretrons’biolog-
icalroles,thereislittleknownabouttheirmechanismofac-
tion. One possibility is that retrons modulate host DNA-
binding proteins via binding to the msDNA. Overexpres-
sion of someE. coliretrons producing DNA with stems
containing mismatched base pairs increases genomic mu-
tation rates by∼40-fold (69) and recombination rates in
high-frequency recombination (Hfr) crosses with a compe-
tentS.enterica Typhimuriumdonorstrain ∼5–10-fold(70).
This increase in genomic mutation rate likely occurs be-
causethemismatchrepairproteinMutSissequesteredonto
the mismatch-containing msDNA stem, reducing protein
availabilityforgenomicreplication-associatedmismatchre-
pair. Notably, overexpression of retrons that produce ms-
DNA with fully complementary stems does not increase
mutation or Hfr rates (70,71). While these increased muta-
tion frequencies only occurred after∼100-fold overexpres-
sion of the msDNA relative to standard lab growth condi-
tions, this study may mimic intracellular or environmental
conditions that increase retron expression to transiently in-
creasegenomicmutationrates( 69).msDNAmaysequester
other DNA-binding proteins to regulate their activity and,
in turn, gene expression patterns (72,73). Additionally, ms-
DNA may directly act as a post-transcriptional gene reg-
ulator, similarly to microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins
(74).
Finally, retrons might play a role in targeted genome di-
versificationoradaptiveimmunity.DGRsarefoundinbac-
teria, viruses, and archaea and selectivelydiversifytargeted
loci known as ‘variable’ regions (75) .T h e s ev a r i a b l er e -
gions typically encode surface-displayed peptides that bind
a changing set of ligands in their environments (76,77). To
target and diversify these regions, DGRs employ special-
ized RTs to reverse transcribe homologous regions known
as‘template’regions,incorporatingrandomnucleotidesop-
posite from adenine residues on the RNA transcript inter-
mediate. The mutated reverse transcript then specifically
retrotransposes to the variable region. While the details
of reverse transcription and transposition have yet to be
determined, recent studies have found that, like retron-
produced msDNA, the prototypical Bordetella bacterio-
phage brt RT produces a branched RNA-DNA structure
most likely joined by 2
′-5′ phosphodiester bonds (78,79).
ThesesimilaritiesbetweenretronmsDNAandDGRcDNA
suggest that perhaps retron msDNA may home to genetic
sequencesviaamechanismthatisanalogoustoDGRretro-
homing. Alternatively, a recent study suggests that certain
NucleicAcidsResearch,2019,Vol.47,No.21 11015
CRISPR-relatedRTsmayhavearisenfromretron-likeRTs,
suggesting that retrons could potentially play a similar role
in adaptive immunity or integration of specific RNA or
DNA sequences into defined genomic positions (80).
RETRONS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
Retrons are potentially powerful tools for genome edit-
ing because they can produce high copy number intracel-
lular DNAs in orthogonal hosts. Early experiments indi-
cated that a Retron-Eco2 (Ec67) msr and RT could suc-
cessfully reverse transcribe a Retron-Eco3 (Ec73) msd, and
vice-versa(33).Thiscriticalexperimentdefinedthatwhilea
retron’s msr and RT are paired, the msd is variable and can
encode an intracellular DNA with an arbitrary sequence.
This critical insight enabled the repurposing of retrons for
biotechnological applications. To date, four studies have
employed retrons forgene silencing or genome editing (13–
15,81). Below, we discuss the context, central findings, and
potential further development of these studies.
Gene targeting in bacteria
Anearlystudydemonstratedthatretronscanbeengineered
to produce antisense cDNAs that hybridized to and ulti-
mately silenced, mRNAs of the targeted genes. Shimada
and colleagues replaced a portion of the msd of Retron-
Eco5 (Ec107) with a sequence targeting the translation ini-
tiation sites of an mRNA encoding theE.coli outer mem-
branelipoprotein( 81).Theauthorstestedtwodifferenttar-
getingsequences,aswellasatargetingsequencecontaining
anEcoRIdigestionsite,potentiallyenablingcleavageofthe
sequencetargetinglipoprotein.Eachtargetingsequencein-
hibited lipoprotein production∼75%.
More recently, a landmark study used retrons as bacte-
rialgenome-editingtools( 13).Inthiswork,smallmolecule-
inducible retrons acted as a population-level genomic ana-
log ‘tape-recorder’ of the small molecules’ presence inE.
coli (Figure 4A, B). Termed Synthetic Cellular Recorders
Integrating Biological Events (‘SCRIBE’), this approach
used engineered variants of Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) with msds
programmed to correct two premature stop codons in re-
porter genes, ultimately editing a total of 5–6 contiguous
bases. Co-expressing the retron msr-msd with the bacterio-
phage lambda red protein Beta (a single-stranded DNA-
binding protein commonly employed in recombineering
(5)) increased editing frequency of the retron transcript
a thousand-fold (from ∼10
−7/cell to ∼10−4/cell) after
overnight expression. This improved genome editing effi-
ciencywasappropriatefordetectionofmodifiedcellswithin
a heterogeneous population. SCRIBE could (i) quantita-
tively record inducers’ concentration and duration by mea-
suring the proportion of cells containing retron-introduced
edits; (ii) record exposure to complex combinations of in-
ducer molecules and (iii) record cellular exposure to light
via the use of a light-responsive promoter.
Retron-based editing in bacteria has been further
adapted to support the possibility of continuous evolution
of target loci (15)( F i g u r e4C). Knocking out MutS, pre-
viously shown to bind retron msDNA, further increased
editing efficiency 21-fold compared to wild-type cells (70).
Removing exonuclease ExoX, which degrades double and
single-stranded DNAs from the 3
′ to 5′ end, increased edit-
ing efficiency 5-fold (82). An E. coli that harbored the
doubleΔmutSΔexoXdeletion increased retron-based edit-
ing efficiency 78-fold to∼0.05/cell after overnight expres-
sion. Measurements with a similar kanamycin resistance-
correcting model system to that employed in the bacterial
tape recorder indicated that retrons could simultaneously
edit up to 13 bases spanning a 31-base region, and insert
and delete three-base regions. Expressing the retron in this
optimized system under an error-prone RNA polymerase
led to the introduction of unprogrammed, random muta-
tions in the targeted gene, setting the stage for continuous
evolution schemes. Overall, these modifications increased
the mutation rate of the targeted region to∼10
−6 base−1
generation−1, ∼200-fold above background.
Heterologous expression of retrons
Biotechnological retron applications were bolstered by
earlystudiesthatretronscanproducesatelliteDNAsineu-
karyotichosts.Forexample,Retron-Eco2(Ec67)expressed
under the control of a Gal10 promoter produced msDNA
in S. cerevisiae(83). Robust msDNA production required
the concurrent expression of the RT and the msr-msd. The
resulting msDNA was the same length as seen in the na-
tive E. colihost. In yeast, moving the RT to the 5
′ side of
the msr-msd region increased msDNA production seven-
fold over that produced in the native orientation where the
RT is to the 3
′ sideofthemsr-msdregion( 83).Retron-Eco2
(Ec67) could also produce msDNA in mouse embryonic fi-
broblasts by expressing this 5
′ RT-containing variant with
T7 RNA polymerase (84). However, msDNA copy number
was ∼25 copies per cell,∼25-fold lower than seen in the
nativebacterialhost.Nonetheless,theseearlystudiesestab-
lishedthatretronscanbeexpressedinorthogonalhostsand
that the host’s RNAse H activity was sufficient to process
the reverse-transcribed msd to generate msDNA.
More recently, retrons have been used for aiding
homology-directed repair of Cas9-targeted breaks in yeast
in a platform termed Cas9 Retron precISe Parallel Edit-
ingviahomologY(‘CRISPEY’)( 14)(Figure 4D).Themsr-
msd of Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) was appended to a Cas9 single
guide RNA (sgRNA) that targeted a genomic region of in-
terest.Co-expressionofthischimericsgRNA-retronRNA,
RT-Eco1 (Ec86) and Cas9 led to the co-localization of two
functionalunits:(i)aCas9nucleasethatgeneratedadefined
DNA break in the vicinity of the edit site; (ii) a DNA tem-
plate derived from the msd segment of the sgRNA-retron
RNA fusion. After Cas9 and RT induction, the reverse-
transcribed msd could carry out homology-directed DNA
break repair at high efficiency. Single nucleotide polymor-
phisms were incorporated in>96% of all clones and a 765
base pair insertion was observed in 87% of edited yeast
cells. Ultimately, this technique was employed for the high-
efficiencyprofilingoftheeffectof ∼16,000single-nucleotide

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
A recent renaissance in retron research is fuelled by their
broad phylogenetic distribution, intriguing potential link-
ages to pathogenesis, and unique biotechnological capabil-
ities.Evenwiththeirnewfoundpopularity,retronfunction,
mechanism of action, and evolutionary origins remain ob-
scure. One critical gap is the lack of a retron RT structure,
either alone or as part of a priming complex. Thus, we can
only conjecture about the unique priming mechanism and
thefunctionsofaccessorydomainsinretronRTs.Thefunc-
tionsofotherretron-associatedORFs arealso unexplored.
As with many natural biomolecules that have proven in-
dispensable to modern biotechnologies, an improved un-
derstanding of natural retron function and biology should
greatly accelerate biotechnology applications.
Retrons are unique in their ability to produce satellite
DNAs with arbitrary sequencesin vivo. This is a feature
that suddenly thrusts retrons to the fore of genome editing
techniques,astheycanbeharnessedtoenablegenomeedit-
ingwithouttheneedtointroduceexternaloligonucleotides
via electroporation or transfection. On the horizon are op-
portunities to harness retrons as dynamic, self-diversifying
templates for editing targeted genes, thereby enabling tar-
geted continuous evolution. Further optimizing retron ex-
pression and function in eukaryotic cells and organisms
will likely enable diverse applications, such as the ability to
markcellsduringembryogenesisandcarryoutlineageanal-
yses via continuous evolution of barcodes. In another vein,
retron-producedDNAmayalsoproveusefulforgenerating
highly programmable DNA nanostructures inside cells. Fi-
nally, retron-derived RTs may have unique applications on
their own, just as Group II intron RTs have found applica-
tions for NGS library preparation.
