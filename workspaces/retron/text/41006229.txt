Reverse transcriptases (RTs) have well-established roles in the replication and
spread of retroviruses and retrotransposons. However, recent evidence sug-
gests that RTs have been conscripted by cells for diverse roles in antiviral
defence. Here we determine structures of a type I-A retron, which explain how
RNA, DNA, RT, HNH-nuclease and four molecules of a structure maintenance
of chromosome (SMC)-family ATPase assemble into a 364 kDa complex that
provides phage defence. We show that phage-encoded nucleases trigger
degradation of the retron-associatedDNA, leading to activation of the HNH
nuclease. The HNH nuclease cleaves tRNA
Ser, stalling protein synthesis and
arresting viral replication. Taken together, these data reveal diverse and
paradoxical roles for RTs in the perpetuation and elimination of genetic
parasites.
Reverse Transcriptases (RTs) were originally discovered in Rous Sar-
coma and murine leukemia viruses1,2. Over the next several decades,
research on RTs suggested that these enzymes are primarily involved
in the replication of sel ﬁsh genetic elements, and occasionally
domesticated for cellular functions ( e.g., telomerase and
spliceosome)
3,4. Initially, RTs were thought to be restricted to the
eukaryotic domain of life5–7,b u ti n1 9 8 9 ,t h r e ei n d e p e n d e n tg r o u p s
discovered RTs in bacteria that make multicopy single-stranded DNA
(msDNA) using an RNA template
8–10. These systems were called
retrons6, but the biological function of these systems remained enig-
matic for almost 30 years11. Recently, these systems have been shown
to provide bacteria with defence against phage infection12–14.
Retrons are diverse (i.e., 13 types and several subtypes), but all
retrons consist of an RT with two distinguishing sequence motifs
(NAXXH and VTG), and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) containing an
inverted repeat and an invariant guanosine that acts as a primer for
branched DNA synthesis
5,15,16. Most retrons are associated with putative
effectors, that are predicted to interact with cell membranes, cleave
DNA, or degrade proteins
13,15,17,18. To date, the only available retron
structure is that of the type II-A3 (Eco1/Ec86) system19–21. These struc-
tures reveal an oligomeric assembly of retrons that sequester an NAD+-
hydrolyzing toxin, which is activated either by phage-induced
methylation of msDNA or, in the case of the type II-A1 retron, by
msDNA degradation mediated by the prophage-encoded exonuclease

With the growing appreciation for the functional diversity of
prokaryotic RTs in antiphage defence13,22,23, we were particularly intri-
gued by a class of RTs that are uniquely associated with Structural
Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) ATPases

conserved across all domains of life, perform critical functions in
organizing higher-order chromosome structures, and facilitate DNA
repair
24,25. Intriguingly, SMC ATPases play critical roles in antiviral
immunity in both eukaryotic (e.g., human Smc5/6 and Rad50)26–28 and
prokaryotic organisms (e.g., PARIS29–31, Wadjet32–34,L a m a s s u35–37,a n d
Gabija37,38). While RTs that synthesize extrachromosomal DNA and
ATPases that recognize foreign DNA are independently recognized as
components of antiviral defence, their unique association in type I-A
retrons—sometimes called type II Septu
39—raises fundamental ques-
tions about their functional synergy.
Here we clarify the functional interplay between RTs and SMC-
family ATPases in type I-A retrons. We determine three different
structures, which explain how RT-generated extrachromosomal
msDNA serves as the structural core of a 364 kDa complex composed
of the RT, a portion of the non-coding RNA, msDNA, two ATPase

homodimers, and an HNH nuclease. Upon infection, a phage encoded
nuclease cleaves the msDNA, potentially triggering disassembly of the
complex leading to activation of the HNH nuclease. The activated HNH
selectively degrades cellular tRNA
Ser, arresting translation and stalling
phage replication. Collectively, the structures, structure-guided
mutants, phage challenge assays, and biochemical experiments pre-
sented here reveal how RT-generated extrachromosomal DNA—once
viewed as a hallmark of selﬁsh elements—acts as a crucial host factor
that relies on SMC ATPases for antiviral defence.
Results
The type I-A retron system protects bacteria against phages
The type I-A retron system consists of a ncRNA, RT, msDNA, ATPase,
and HNH nuclease (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b)15.H e r ew ef o c u s
on a type I-A retron we identiﬁed in the FORC 82 strain ofEscherichia
coli. To determine if theE. coliFORC 82 retron provides phage defence,
we cloned the operon along with ~550 bases of the upstream DNA,
which is expected to encode the ncRNA (Fig. 1a)
15.T h er e t r o n -
containing plasmid or an empty vector control was transformed intoE.
coli MG1655, and plaque assays were performed using T3, T4, T5, and
T7 phages. While the retron conferred defence against T3 and T5, no
immunity was observed against T4 or T7 (Fig.1b, Supplementary
Fig. 1c). Notably, the level of defense was stronger against T3 than T5,
suggesting potential differences in how these phages activate or evade
retron-mediated immunity.
To assess the role of each protein component in phage immunity,
we introduced active site mutations in the ATPase (D387A), HNH
nuclease (H71A), or the RT (YADD to YAAA). Mutations in the ATPase or
HNH active sites eliminate retron-based phage defence, while attempts
to clone mutations in the RT active site (YADD to YAAA) consistently
failed, suggesting that these mutants are toxic (Supplementary Fig. 1d,
Supplementary Data 1). Persistent attempts to clone the RT mutant
resulted in the emergence of compensatory mutations in the ATPase
(Q454K) or the HNH (G44S) and the ATPase (V73A) that rendered the
defence system inactive (Supplementary Fig. 1e, Supplementary
Data 1). Attempts to revert the ATPase Q454K mutation yielded 13
clones, all of which carried the intended reversion (K454Q) but also
contained frameshift mutations within the ATPase, indicating con-
tinued selective pressure to mitigate toxicity. These results demon-
strate that all protein components of theE. coliFORC82 retron system
are indispensable for defence, consistent with observations reported
for retron Ec78
12,13.
Given the involvement of multiple proteins, DNA, and RNA in the
type I-A retron defence system, we hypothesized that the retron forms
a multicomponent complex capable of recognizing phages and con-
ferring immunity. To purify the complex, weﬁrst identiﬁed the 5’ and 3’
boundaries of the ncRNA by developing a covariation model built by
aligning regions upstream of type I-A retron RTs (Fig.1c). The model
reveals a long stem-loop structure consistent with previous
observations
15. The predicted non-coding RNA and each of the protein-
coding genes were cloned into an expression vector with afﬁnity tags
on either the C-terminus of the HNH nuclease (HNH-Strep), the
N-terminus of the RT (Strep-RT), or the N-terminus of the ATPase
(Strep-ATPase). Placement of the afﬁnity tags was informed using
structural predictions, which indicated that the N-terminus of the HNH
nuclease would be buried, while the C-termini of both the RT and
ATPase were avoided due to predicted interactions with adjacent
proteins or the ncRNA. While the afﬁnity-tagged proteins preserve

retron-mediated immunity, only the tagged ATPase effectively pulls
down all components of the retron (Supplementary Fig. 1f, g). The
afﬁnity-puriﬁed complex elutes from size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) as a monodispersed peak with an estimated molecular weight of
350 kDa. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry were used to identify all
three protein components (i.e., ATPases, RT, and HNH), while dena-
turing urea-PAGE and nucleases assays were used to identify the ~90
nucleotide msDNA, and a ~ 40 nucleotide ncRNA (Fig.1d, e, Supple-
mentary Data 2). Ourﬁndings suggest that all components of the type
I-A retron assemble into a multicomponent complex that is necessary
for phage defence.
The puriﬁed complex was used for structure determination
using cryo-EM (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary
Table 1). 2D classiﬁcation revealed that a subset of particles con-
tained an extra lobe of asymmetric density. This was reﬂected in
initial 3D reconstructions which contained weak density for the
additional domain. Focused 3D classiﬁcation performed using a soft
mask over the area of weak density produced three distinct struc-
tures with overall resolutions of 3.1 Å (Fig.1f, Supplementary Fig. 3).
Preliminary models of the complex were built by docking
AlphaFold3
40 predicted structures into the maps. This process
revealed that the RT and a portion of the ncRNA comprise the head
of the assembly, while the msDNA protrudes from the RT like a
harpoon that extends all the way through the center of the complex.
The HNH nuclease is asymmetrically bound to one of the two
ATPase homodimers, in either an up or down conﬁguration. Com-
parison between the HNH-up, HNH-down, and no-HNH structures
revealed minimal structural differences between the shared sub-
units. The RMSD of each of the shared subunits in each of the three
structures was less than 0.7 Å. Notably, density for the C-terminal
region of the ATPase—which interacts with the HNH subunit—was
only visible in the HNH-bound structures.
Extrachromosomal DNA synthesized by RT is a scaffold for the
SMC ATPase
To understand how reverse transcription leads to formation of the
retron, we compared an AlphaFold3-predicted structure of the ncRNA-
RT complex to the experimentally determined structure of the retron
complex (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast to the experimentally determined
structure (i.e., post-assembly), the predicted structure is likely to
represent an early intermediate. In both the predicted and experi-
mentally determined structures, stem-loop 1 (SL-1) forms a molecular
handle that interacts with the thumb domain of the RT and likely
remains anchored to the RT
41,42, while the RNA template is reeled
through the active site during reverse transcription (Fig.2a–d, Sup-
plementary Fig. 4a, c).
In the predicted ncRNA-RT structure, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the
ncRNA form a conserved stem-loop (SL-3) that is positioned within a
cleft of the RT formed by the thumb and palm domains (Fig.2a–c)43.
The prediction places the branching guanosine of the ncRNA, which
serves as the primer for reverse transcription, near the VTG motif and
the YADD active site (Fig.2c)
15,16. Reeling of the RNA template into the
RT active site is anticipated to require unzipping the predicted stem of
the ncRNA, and displacement of SL-3.
The clamp (CL) is a highly conserved feature of the ncRNA
(Fig. 2a). This sequence is predicted to interact with the palm domain
of the RT, prior to reverse transcription, while in the experimentally
determined structure, the clamp is a linchpin that simultaneous con-
tacts the 3′-end of the cDNA, the ATPase, and key domains of the RT,
including theﬁnger, palm, and VTG motif (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e).
Collectively, these structural comparisons suggest that during reverse
transcription, the 3′ end of the ncRNA is reeled through the active site
and into the cleft formed by the thumb and palm domain (initially
occupied by SL-3) while the SL-1 handle remains bound by the RT.
Reeling of the template positions the 3′ end of the msDNA and the
ncRNA termination sequence (TS) in close proximity, forming an RNA-
DNA hybrid at the site previously occupied by SL-3 (Supplementary
Fig. 4d, e).
The ATPase homodimers form an extensive network of electro-
static interactions with the msDNA (Fig.2e, Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Notably, a cluster of basic residues within insertion sequence 1 (IS1)—a
conserved feature of SMC ATPases—is oriented towards the msDNA-
binding cavity (Fig.2e)
25. However, IS1 is dynamic and density for IS1 is
weak (Movie 1). While single-point mutants (K100A, K103A, K109A,
K141A, N151A, N152A, K196A, or K201A) at residues involved in msDNA
binding had no detectable impact on phage defense (Supplementary
Fig. 5b), a single construct with multiple charge-swap mutations in IS1
were unclonable (R195E, K196E, R197E, K198E, K201E, and K203E),
suggesting toxicity (Fig.2e). Similarly, structure-guided mutations that
disrupt the interface between the RT and ATPase (RT residues: S217R,
N219R and E220R) were also unclonable (Fig.2f). In contrast, these
mutants were successfully cloned in constructs with limited retron
expression. Together, theseﬁndings underscore the critical role of
msDNA and RT in orchestrating ATPase assembly, which is essential for
the functional integrity of the retron.
SMC ATPases typically dimerize in the presence of ATP and play a
central role in forming chromosomal structures that mediate DNA
repair
24,25. Insertion sequence 2 (IS2) is a conserved feature of SMC
ATPases that forms long coiled-coil domains, which wrap around
genomic DNA
25,44. In retrons, the ATPase dimers are offset by ~75°
relative to each other and coiled-coils from two adjacent ATPases
encircle the extrachromosomal msDNA in an ATPase-mediated bear
hug on one side of the complex and a dorsalﬁns h a p e ds t r u c t u r eo n
the other (Fig.2g–i). While the IS2-mediated bear hug obscures access
to the msDNA, 3D variability analysis reveals a subset of particles with
an alternate conformation, where the IS2 arms are disordered and the
msDNA is exposed (Movie 1). Collectively, this reveals a conserved role
for IS2 in binding chromosomal DNA during repair or msDNA during
retron assembly.
ATPase homodimers form a claw that grasps the HNH nuclease
The HNH nuclease is anchored to the retron complex via the
C-terminal extension of the ATPase, which forms a triple helix
(Figs. 1a, 3a, b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1b). The C-terminal triple helix
from adjacent subunits form a claw-like structure that grips the
C-terminal region of the HNH nuclease and structure guided muta-
tions in ATPase (D522R, L523R, V526R, F529A, and K530D) result in a
complete loss of defence (Fig.3a, b, d). The nuclease is asymme-
trically recruited to one side of the complex (i.e., one pair of
C-terminal extensions) in either an up or down orientation (Fig.1f).
Exclusion of the HNH from the opposing homodimer is partially
explained by steric hindrance from the RT. In addition, three of the
four ATPase nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) include clear den-
sity for ATP, while the fourth NBD (NBD4) is reordered in a way that is
incompatible with ATP binding (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). This
arrangement and exclusion of ATP from this NBD is consistent
between the HNH-bound and HNH-free structures, demonstrating
that the unique pose of NBD4 occurs during assembly rather than
during HNH binding. Structural comparison with the type-I Septu
ATPase (PDB: 8EEA) reveals a similar pattern of ATP exclusion, sug-
gesting a conserved function in complex assembly, as opposed to
HNH binding (Supplementary Fig. 6e)
45.
While mutations in the RT active site result in toxicity, a sponta-
neous mutation in the ATPase (Q454K) renders the RT active site
mutants non-toxic. Q454 is conserved across type I-A retron ATPases,
and the structure explains a role for this residue in stabilizing the claw-
like structure (Fig.3c). Although Q454 does not directly interact with
the HNH nuclease, the Q to K mutation leads to a complete loss of
defence, highlighting the importance of the claw-like structure in
recruitment of the HNH (Fig.3d).

The msDNA is a phage sensor
Building on our structural understanding, we hypothesized that
retron activation is triggered by speciﬁc components of the infecting
phage. To test this hypothesis, we screened for phage mutants that
escape retron-mediated defence. Cells expressing the retron defence
system were infected with phages T3 and T5. Three T3 escape
mutants were isolated, but no escapers were recovered for T5
despite repeated attempts (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Whole-genome
sequencing of the T3 escape mutants revealed mutations inﬁve
phage genes (i.e., serine/threonine kinase, an exonuclease, a small
hypothetical protein, a tail protein, and a tailﬁber), and the insertion
of three guanosines between two genes (YP_009792963.1 and
YP_009792964.1) (Fig.4a). While serine/threonine kinase was toxic
by itself, phage tailﬁber, phage tail protein, and the exonuclease
were expressed either alone or in retron-containing cells. Co-
expression of the exonuclease with the retron severely impaired
bacterial growth, whereas no growth defect was observed when the
exonuclease was expressed alone or with a retron containing an
inactive HNH nuclease (H71A) (Fig.4b, c). These results indicate that
T3 exonuclease triggers retron-mediated immunity.

sequence of retron I-A fromE. coliis mapped onto the covariance model shown in
Fig. 1c. Conserved stem-loop motifs (SL-1, SL-2, and SL-3), the clamp (CL) and

The magniﬁed region highlights the conserved VTG motif, which is predicted to
make contacts with the DNA backbone, positioning the priming guanosine (G8,
yellow) and adenosine 7 (A7, purple) near the active site (YADD, pink).d Like the
predicted structure of ncRNA-RT prior to msDNA synthesis (panel c), the
experimentally determined structure of retron I-A reveals interactions between the
RT thumb domain and SL-1. The duplex formed by the TS and the 3′ end of the
msDNA is positioned between the thumb and palm domains, occupying the site
previously occupied by SL-3 in panel c. The magniﬁed region highlights the 3′ end
of the cDNA contacting the YADD active site.e The IS1ﬂexible loop of the SMC

the exonuclease active site (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Co-expression of
the T3 W48R exonuclease mutant with the retron did not result in cell
growth arrest, suggesting that retron activation is dependent on spe-
ciﬁc structural features beyond the active site (Fig.4c). Mapping the
remaining escaper mutations on the exonuclease structure revealed
that none of the mutations occurred at the active site (Supplementary
Fig. 7d). This suggests that the exonuclease activity is not required for
retron activation, or this activity is essential for phage replication and
mutations that disrupt its function are not tolerated. To determine
whether the exonuclease directly degrades msDNA, acts indirectly
through other cellular nucleases, or has no impact on msDNA integrity,
we mutated the exonuclease active site (D162K) and co-expressed the
mutant or the wild-type (WT) exonuclease in retron containing cells.
Co-expression of the T3 exonuclease active site mutant (D162K) or T3
phage escaper mutant (W48R) with retron results in no growth arrest
and no degradation of the msDNA, while the WT exonuclease results in
both growth arrest and msDNA degradation (Fig.4c, d, Supplementary
Fig. 7b, c). Collectively, these data demonstrates that the T3 exonu-
clease triggers retron activation, that residues outside of the active site
are necessary for retron-mediated recognition of the trigger, and that
t h en u c l e a s ea c t i v es i t ei sn e c e s s a r yf o rd e g r a d i n gt h em s D N A .
To better understand the mechanism of retron activation by the
T3 exonuclease, we identiﬁed and compared related nucleases using a
combination of AlphaFold3
40 and FoldSeek46 (Supplementary Fig. 7d,
e). T3 exonuclease is structurally similar to the T4, T5, and T7ﬂap
nucleases that have been proposed to remove Okazaki fragments
(Supplementary Fig. 7e)
47–50. The T3, T5 (D15), and T7 nucleases trigger
growth arrest in retron-expressing cells, whereas the T4-encoded
nuclease had no detectable effect on cell growth (Fig.4c, e). Consistent
with this observation, expression of nucleases from T3, T5, and T7 led
to msDNA cleavage, but the nuclease from T4 fails to cleave msDNA
(Supplementary Fig. 7f). While growth inhibition by T3 and T5
nucleases in retron-expressing cells aligns with the observed immunity
against these phages, T7 phage evades retron-mediated defence,
despite its nuclease triggering degradation of the msDNA. This sug-
gests that msDNA cleavage occurs at reduced levels or slower rates
during a T7 infection as compared to the overexpression system, or
that T7 encodes an anti-retron mechanism that occurs downstream of
msDNA degradation. While more work remains to be done regarding
the mechanism of retron evasion by T7, our results suggest that retron-
mediated protection generally correlates with nuclease-mediated
cleavage of msDNA.
Retron activation triggers translation arrest
The type I Septu defence system, composed of an ATPase and an HNH
nuclease, degrades viral DNA during infection45. Growth arrest fol-
lowing type I-A retron activation, along with structural similarity
between the retron and Septu HNH nucleases, led us to hypothesize
that the retron would rely on a similar mechanism (Supplementary
Fig. 6e). To test this hypothesis, we repeated experiments done for

Septu by inducingE. coli cells expressing either the WT or an HNH-
dead mutant (H71A) retron along with the T3 exonuclease and ana-
lyzed the cellular DNA usingﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig.5a). Rather
than DNA degradation, we observed nucleoid compaction and propi-
dium iodide exclusion (Fig.5a, Supplementary Fig. 8). In bacteria,
transcription, translation, and membrane insertion of proteins are
tightly coupled through a process known as transertion, and disrup-
tion of translation has been shown to induce DNA compaction
51–53.
Collectively, these data suggest that retron-mediated growth arrest is
due to translational inhibition.
During the course of this work, Azam et al. reported that
expression of a related ATPase and HNH nuclease isolated from the
type I-A retron (Ec78) from strain 102598 ofE. coli, led to the degra-
dation of bacterial tRNA
Tyr (Supplementary Fig. 1)54. Additionally, they
showed that T5 phage encodes a tRNATyr resistant to cleavage by the
retron system. Inspired by theseﬁndings and results from our micro-
scopy, we performed tRNA sequencing of cells expressing the T3
exonuclease with either the WT retron or HNH-inactive (H71A) control.
This analysis reveals a signiﬁcant depletion of all four serine tRNAs
encoded inE. coliMG1655 (Fig.5b, Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Alpha-
Fold3 prediction of two HNH nucleases with tRNA
Ser-GGA yielded a
low-conﬁdence model of an HNH dimer, in which dimerization is
mediated by the C-terminal extension that otherwise facilitates inter-
action with the ATPase (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig. 9c, d).
The T5 phage genome also includes tRNAs for serine, which would
be anticipated to complement tRNAs depleted by the activated retron.
To verify the T5 genome, we sequenced and compared the T5 strain we
were using to the WT T5 genome in NCBI (T5
WT). The T5 strain used in

these experiments (designated T5MSU) includes a 8.6 kb deletion
within the tRNA-rich genomic region (Fig.5c)55. This deletion elim-
inates 10 of the 25 tRNAs including a tRNASer containing a GCT antic-
odon (tRNASer-GCT), which decodes a highly represented codon in
both the T5 andE. coligenomes (Supplementary Fig. 9e). The deletion
of T5 encoded tRNAs may occur spontaneously during serial passage
of the virus in the absence of selective pressures (e.g., immune sys-
tems). To investigate whether phage-supplemented tRNAs contribute
to evasion of retron immunity, we cloned and expressed tRNA
Ser-GCT
in cells infected with T5 MSU, which is missing tRNA Ser-GCT
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). Surprisingly, supplementation did not
confer detectable evasion of retron-mediated phage defense. North-
ern blot analysis of total RNA from cells co-expressing T5 tRNA
Ser-GCT,
the wild-type retron, and the T3 exonuclease revealed a distinct clea-
vage band for both E. coli and T5 tRNA
Ser-GCT (Supplementary
Fig. 10c). In contrast, this cleavage band was absent in cells expressing
the HNH-inactive retron. We next asked whether the previously iden-
tiﬁed retron inhibitor gene (ORF75), in combination with phage-
encoded tRNAs, is necessary for phage evasion of the retron

performed whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b).
The T5ATCC genome includes the full complement of phage tRNAs
(including tRNASer) and ORF75. However, phage challenge assays
revealed that T5ATCC does not evade FORC 82 retron immunity. Thus,
in contrast to retron Ec78 described by Azam et al.54, neither T5-
encoded tRNAs nor ORF75 contribute to evasion of FORC 82 retron
immunity. Instead, ourﬁndings demonstrate that the FORC 82 retron
can cleave host and phage-encoded tRNA
Ser.
Finally, we investigated how viral tRNAs differ fromE. colitRNAs
that enable retron-mediated elimination by retron Ec78 yet remain
ineffective against retron FORC-82. We alignedE. coli tRNA
Tyr and
tRNASer sequences with their counterparts encoded in the WT T5
genome (Supplementary Fig. 11). Notably, most differences between
the phage andE. colitRNAs cluster in or around the D-loop, a region
recognized by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
56. To determine if D-loop
variation in tRNAs is a more general theme, we alignedE. colitRNAs to
each of the corresponding tRNAs in T5. All 23 tRNAs in the T5 genome
contain D-loop mutations relative to analogous isoaccepters inE. coli.
However, mutations were not restricted to the D-loop, which is con-
sistent with a wider spectrum of nucleases that target tRNA degrada-
tion and modiﬁcation
29,31,57,58.
Discussion
The competing selﬁsh interest of viruses and their hosts results in a
biological tit-for-tat that necessitates perpetual innovation to avoid
extinction
59–61. As part of this process, genes with one function are
often conscripted, repurposed, or swapped between the competing
interests in ways that (temporarily) enhance ﬁtness62,63.H e r ew e
determine structures, perform structure-guided mutations, phage
challenge assays, and biochemical experiments that collectively
explain how bacteria and archaea use RTs to generate extra-
chromosomal DNA, that serves as a scaffold to recruit SMC ATPases
and HNH nucleases for antiviral defence. The experimentally deter-
mined structure and structure predictions add new insight to the
process of reverse transcription, and explain how the RT links the

Insertion sequences 1 and 2 (IS1 and IS2), both characteristic features
of SMC ATPases, play distinct structural roles: IS1 interacts with the
msDNA, while IS2 stabilizes the ATPase homodimer through bear hug
and dorsalﬁn features. Further, the C-terminal extensions from two
opposing ATPase subunits form a claw-like structure that engages the
HNH nuclease, whereas the corresponding regions in the other two
subunits are disordered (Fig.1). The mechanism by which only a single
HNH is recruited per retron, as well as the functional implications of
the up, down, or no HNH conﬁgurations, remains unclear.
The C-terminal claw of the ATPase and the HNH are structurally
similar to that previously reported for Septu (RMSD = 1.1 Å across 56
atom pairs, and 2.7 Å across all 84 pairs) (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b)
45.
However, Septu systems do not involve RTs, the HNH is reported to be
a DNase rather than an RNase, and the viral activator is unknown45.T h e
HNH structure reported here is nearly identical to the HNH from Septu
(RMSD = 1.1 Å across 101 pruned atom pairs), so it remains unclear how
subtle structural differences result in distinct biological outcomes.
Nevertheless, the ability of retron-associated HNHs to cleave tRNAs
makes them unique among HNH family nucleases that are frequently
associated with DNA cleavage
64.
Phage-encoded nucleases trigger msDNA degradation, but the
mechanism of degradation remains unclear. According to the struc-
ture, the msDNA and/or ncRNA are vulnerable to nuclease activity at
the head (SL1, SL2 and/or SL3), the body (shaft of the msDNA), or the
poorly ordered tip of the msDNA, which includes 12 unmodeled bases
that extend beyond the ATPases. Initially we suspected the tip, because
it is most exposed and because the covariance model predicts high
variability in this region, which could reﬂect a mechanism for identi-
fying different phage triggers. However, truncation of the loop had no
impact on defence (Supplementary Fig. 7g), suggesting that the tip of
the harpoon may not be directly involved in trigger detection. Multiple
efforts to use AlphaFold3 to predict a binding site for the trigger never
resulted in a high conﬁdence prediction, but most of the models
positioned the T3 exonuclease near the head of the complex. Ver-
iﬁcation of these models will require further structural studies.
The ability of T7 phage to infect cells expressing the FORC 82
retron is intriguing, given that itsﬂap nuclease is structurally similar
(RMSD = 0.455 Å across 300 pruned atom pairs) and shares 92% amino
acid identity with the T3 nuclease. While overexpression of either
nuclease results in msDNA degradation and toxicity in retron-
expressing cells, only T3 phage is neutralized by the immune system,
suggesting that T7 may encode an anti-retron gene (Fig.5d). One
candidate is the T7 serine/threonine kinase, which was recently shown
to phosphorylate and inhibit the toxin RcaT in the type II retron-Eco9
65.
While it is currently unknown whether T7 kinase could inhibit nucleic
acid targeting components of retron I-A, T7 kinase shares 46% amino
acid identity with a serine/threonine kinase which showed unique
mutations in the T3 escaper screen (Fig.4a). Notably, a missense
mutation in the T3 escaper kinase deletes the predicted DNA-binding
C-terminal domain, although whether this mutation confers gain-of-
function activity in phosphorylating retron components remains
unclear. Further investigation is required to determine whether kinase-
mediated phosphorylation helps T7 evade immunity by retron type I-A.
Recently, Azam et al. reported that co-expressing the ATPase and
HNH nuclease from a type I-A retron inE. coli(Ec78) depletes cellular
tRNA
Tyr
54, whereas we reveal that the retron fromE. coli FORC 82
reduces total serine tRNA levels by half. This divergence in tRNA spe-
ciﬁcity suggests that different retron systems have evolved distinct
substrate preferences. This model parallels what we and others
observed for the TOPRIM nuclease in the PARIS defence system, where
distinct tRNAs are cleaved by TOPRIM nuclease from related PARIS
systems
29,58. However, unlike the Ec78 retron and PARIS, in which
virally encoded tRNAs can antagonize immune activity, the tRNASer
from T5 does not appear to evade cleavage by the FORC 82 retron. This
suggests that bacteria continually evolve HNH variants to counteract
tRNA-encoding phages, or that retron-mediated tRNA-cleavage is only
the ﬁrst step of a more complex pathway leading to growth arrest.
Together, ourﬁndings underscore the paradoxical role of RTs in both
viral propagation and antiviral defense, highlight the functional plas-
ticity of SMC ATPases across processes like DNA repair and immunity,
and expand our understanding of how tRNAs—either resistant or sus-
ceptible to HNH cleavage—are shaped by the selective pressures of
genetic conﬂict.
Method
Statistics & reproducibility
Phage challenge assays and bacterial growth assays were performed in
two or three independent biological replicates, as shown in the main
and Supplementary Fig. panels and detailed in the source dataﬁle.
Replicate data and uncropped images of gels and plates are provided
in the source dataﬁle. Gel images showing msDNA cleavage was per-
formed in two or three independent biological replicates (Fig.4d,
Supplementary Fig. 7f; see Source Data File). Fluorescence microscopy
was performed in two independent biological replicates and is pre-
sented in Fig.5a, Supplementary Fig. 8, and the source dataﬁle. Dif-
ferential tRNA abundance was calculated using DESeq2, which
employs a two-sided negative binomial model to estimate log
2 fold
changes and to determine statistical signiﬁcance (p-values).
Plasmid construction

experiments were performed using T7 promoters in a pRSF backbone,
with an N-terminal Strep-tag on the ATPase. The phage triggers were
cloned into pCDFDuet-1. Protein expression and pull-down assays were
conducted inE. coliBL21 AI cells. The retron operon fromE. coliFORC
82 was synthesized as a gene fragment by GenScript. The triggers were
ampliﬁed and cloned from respective phages.
All primers used for cloning were obtained from Euroﬁns Geno-
mics. Cloning was performed in either DH5α or NEB Turbo competent
E. colicells, and plasmids were extracted using the Zymo ZR Plasmid
Miniprep Kit. The sequence of each cloned construct was veriﬁed by
whole plasmid sequencing using Oxford Nanopore (Plasmidsaurus).

Constructs with the pACYCDuet-1 backbone were maintained with

otherwise speciﬁed. All plasmids used in this study are provided in

Plaque assays were performed using high phage titers (108 PFU/mL) of
T3, T4, T5, and T7.E. coliMG1655 cells transformed with plasmids for
the WT retron, empty vector (pACYCDuet-1), or mutant retrons were
grown to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 in LB media supplemented with
chloramphenicol (34µg/mL). The cells were added to 0.6% agarose in
LB (top layer) and the suspension was poured onto plates containing
3.2% LB agar (bottom agar). Both the top layer and the bottom agar
were supplemented with chloramphenicol and 2 mM CaCl
2.O n c et h e
top layer solidiﬁed, 2.5µL of 10-fold serial dilutions of phage stocks
were spotted on the lawn ofE. coli cells. The plates were then incu-
bated overnight at 37 °C.
Although wild-type T3 is unable to infectE. coliK-12 strains as it
requires a truncated R1-type LPS core66,67, we consistently observe
infection of MG1655 using a strain of T3 with mutations in the tailﬁber
gene. MG1655 was acquired fromE. coli Genetic Resource Center
(https://ecgrc.net). While the precise mechanism of infection remains
unclear, these observations likely reﬂect strain-speciﬁc differences in
T3 or MG1655.
Covariance model and sequence comparison for ncRNA
and tRNA
Retron type I-A containing genomes15 were downloaded from NCBI
(n = 70). 1 kb upstream of each RTs was extracted using a custom
Python script and aligned using MAFFTv7.52068 with the following
parameters--maxiterate 1000 --localpair. Poorly aligned regions at both
ends of the alignment were trimmed, and a well-aligned ~250 bp region
corresponding to the conserved ncRNA element was extracted. This
region was then realigned with mLocARNA v2.0.0
69 using --stockholm
--concensus-structure alifold. The resulting alignment was used to gen-
erate a covariance model that was visualized with R2R v1.0.770.
E. coliMG1655 and WT T5 genomes were downloaded from NCBI
database. tRNAscan-SE web server71 was used to predict T5 tRNAs.
mLocARNA v2.0.069 was used to align tRNA sequences to generate
sequence alignments and covariance model.
Recombinant expression and puriﬁcation of the retron complex
The N-terminally Strep-tagged ATPase along with the other type I-A
retron components, were co-expressed using an inducible T7 pro-
moter inE. coliBL21 AI cells. Cultures were grown in LB media con-
taining 50μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C until OD600 ~ 0.5, then induced
with 0.2 mM Isopropylβ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 0.1%
arabinose and grown for 16 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by cen-
trifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, then lysed by sonication in
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl
2, 1 mM DTT).
T h el y s a t ew a sc l a r iﬁed by centrifuging at 10,000 ×g for 25 min, and
the supernatant was passed through a 5 mL StrepTactin column (IBA
Lifescence). After washing with the 20-column volumes of the lysis
buffer, bound proteins were eluted using lysis buffer supplemented
with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The retron was further puriﬁed using a
Superdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,
200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl
2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol. Fractions contain-
ing the puriﬁed retron components were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE to
resolve protein components, while 15% urea-PAGE was used to visua-
lize ncRNA and msDNA. The fraction containing the retron complex
was further concentrated and used for vitriﬁcation.
SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to each protein (n =1 ) were sent
to the IDeA National Resource for Quantitative Proteomics for mass
spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis for bands corre-
sponding to ATPase, RT and HNH are shown in Supplementary Data 2.
Cryo-EM sample preparation
C-ﬂat copper grids with a mesh size of 300 and R1.2/1.3 hole spacing
were glow discharged using a Pelco EsiGlow at 15 mA for 45 seconds.
3 µLo f4 µM retron was applied to prepared grids in a Vitrobot Mk IV
(ThermoFischer) set to 100% humidity and 4 °C. Grids were subjected
to double-sided blotting with a force of 5 for 5 s before plunge-freezing
in liquid ethane. Clipped grids were loaded into autogrid boxes and
stored in liquid nitrogen before imaging.
Cryo-EM data collection
Data were collected on a Talos Arctica (Thermo Fischer) equipped with
a Gatan K3 direct electron detector at Montana State University’sC r y o -
EM core facility using SerialEM
72 under the control of SmartScope73 for
automated data collection. 15,594 micrographs were collected with a
pixel size of 0.9061 Å and apparent magniﬁcation of 45,000X. The
total dose per exposure was calculated as 56.69 electrons with
37 subframes per exposure (1.53el/px/frame).
Cryo-EM data processing
After ﬁltering micrographs by CTF-ﬁt <8 Å resolution and total motion
<100 px, 13,695 exposures were subjected to blob picking in
cryoSPARC
74 Live (60–200 Å diameter). 1,576,065 blobs were extrac-
ted using a box size of 512px (binx2) and sorted by 2D classiﬁcation to
yield a stack of 358,381 selected particles. From these particles, a de
novo template volume was generated which contained 245,457 parti-
cles and reﬁned to 3.7 Å. Using this volume as a template for particle
picking, 7,373,097 particles were extracted with a box size of 512 px
(binx4) and subjected to 2D classiﬁcation with a 200 Å mask. 1,321,836
particles were selected and fed into a 3-class ab initio reconstruction.
One class was identiﬁed containing 1,244,961 particles that appeared
to correspond to the retron complex but exhibited compositional
heterogeneity in regions of density corresponding to the HNH. Using a
soft-padded mask directed towards the HNH, focused 3D classiﬁcation
yielded three distinct particle classes that varied based on the orien-
tation (up or down), or absence of the HNH subunit. Un-binned par-
ticles were then re-extracted with a box size of 480px for non-uniform
reﬁnement. After reference-based motion correction, we carried out a
ﬁnal round of 2D classiﬁcation to remove remaining junk. Final
reconstructions were obtained from non-uniform reﬁnements with
several options enabled including minimizing over per particle scale,
correcting for per-particle defocus and estimating the exposure group
parameters Cs, Anisotropic Magniﬁcation, and tetrafoil. Phenix’s
75 half-
map based sharpening was used to aid in model building.
Model building
An initial model was established by docking AlphaFold3 predicted
structures into the density40. After rigid bodyﬁtting the individual
chains using theﬁt in map command in ChimeraX74, each chain was
equilibrated in ISOLDE76 to improve the initial model. For each density
map, the corresponding maps and models were provided to Phenix75
for real-space reﬁnement. Per residue CC scores were used to guide the

trimming ofﬂexible loops and regions of poor density. Sidechains not
visible in the map were removed. Maps were sharpened using Phenix’s
implementation of anisotropic half-map sharpening to aid in modeling
difﬁcult regions. Additionally, 3DVA volumes were used to inform the
position of the ATPase coiled-coil domains
77. While these features were
not included in the mask during theﬁnal iterations of high-resolution
reﬁnement, they are clearly visible in lower-resolution reﬁnements of
the same particle stacks used to generate the maps submitted to EMDB
(Supplementary Table 1). As such, we opted to include the coiled coil
domain in the PDBs, which helps to explain how access to the msDNA is
gated by ATPase subunits, as well as highlight the role of the coiled coil
in the tetrameric assembly of ATPases.
Phage escaper screening and genome sequencing
Phage escaper assay was performed as described in Avigail et al.18.
Brieﬂy, E. coliMG1655 cells with or without the retron were grown in LB
media at 37 °C to mid-log phase (OD600 ~0 . 4 )i nt h ep r e s e n c eo f2 5µg/
mL chloramphenicol and 2 mM CaCl2. In four separate tubes having
2m Lo fL Ba n d2m MC a C l2, bacterial cultures were added to obtain the
following percentages of defence-containing cells: 0%, 1%, 10%, or
100%. Cultures were inoculated with 20µLo fT 3o rT 5p h a g es t o c ka n d
incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The tubes were centrifuged
at 5000 × g for 10 min, and 20µLo ft h ec l a r iﬁed supernatants were
transferred into fresh cultures prepared under the same conditions.
This passaging step was repeated for four consecutive rounds.
Supernatants from the fourth passage wereﬁlter-sterilized (0.22µm),
serially diluted, and plated for plaque assays on defence-containing
cells. Phage preparations that formed plaques were re-tested, and
three individual plaques were picked for T3. No escapers could be
isolated for T5. Each T3 plaque was used to inoculate 2 mL of mid-log
defence-containing cultures (25µg/mL chloramphenicol), which were
grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking and then centrifuged at
5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants wereﬁlter-
sterilized (0.22µm) and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Pel-
lets were gently resuspended in 300µL of SM buffer, andﬁnal phage
stocks were stored at 4 °C.
Phage genomic DNA was extracted following previously descri-
bed protocols
78. Isolated phage stocks were incubated with DNase I
and RNase A for 1 h to eliminate contaminatingE. coli DNA. The
nucleases were then inactivated by adding EDTA and heating at 65 °C.
Phage capsids were digested with proteinase K in the presence of SDS,
and the resulting phage genomic DNA was puri ﬁed by
phenol–chloroform extraction. The puriﬁed DNA was sequenced using
the Native Barcoding Kit V14 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) on a
GridION sequencer. Raw Nanopore reads were concatenated and
a s s e m b l e dd en o v ou s i n gt h eF l y ep a c k a g e

ome was compared to the T3 sequence used in the lab.
Bacterial growth assay
Chemically competent E. coli cells containing either WT or HNH-
inactive retron (pACYCDuet-1 backbone) was transformed with WT or
mutant exonuclease (pCDFDuet-1 backbone) and plated on LB agar
having 2% glucose and grown at 37 °C in the presence of appropriate
antibiotics (chloramphenicol and streptomycin). Individual colonies
were grown overnight in the presence of 2% glucose and antibiotics
and 10-fold serial dilution of the liquid culture was spotted in LB agar
plates containing either 2% glucose or 0.2 mM IPTG in the presence of
antibiotics. The plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and imaged.
msDNA cleavage analysis
Chemically competentE. coli cells containing the WT retron were
transformed with WT or mutant T3 exonuclease and cultured over-
night in LB media supplemented with 2% glucose and antibiotics
(chloramphenicol and streptomycin). The overnight cultures were
then used to inoculate a secondary culture and grown to OD
600 of ~0.4
in the presence of antibiotics. IPTG was added to induce expression of
the exonuclease. DNA was extracted using the Zymo ZR Plasmid
Miniprep kit and DNA shorter than 500 bps were resolved by 15%
urea-PAGE.
Fluorescence microscopy
Bacterial cells carrying either WT or HNH-inactive retron in the
pACYCDuet-1 backbone were transformed with T3 exonuclease and
grown in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics
(chloramphenicol and streptomycin) at 37 °C until reaching an OD
600
of 0.5–0.6. Cultures were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C
with shaking. Following induction, cells were harvested by cen-
trifugation and washed with 1× PBS. Cells were simultaneously incu-
bated with 5µg/mL Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Oregon Green
(Invitrogen, W7024) and 10µg/mL propidium iodide for 15 min at RT
followed by two washes with 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated with
50 µg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes in the
dark at room temperature. After staining, cells were transferred to
Poly-L-lysine-treated coverslips and allowed to adhere for 5 min before
imaging. Imaging was performed using an inverted spinning-disc
confocal microscope built by 3i. The system included a Zeis 63×1.4 NA
Plan-Apochromat objective, Yokogawa CSU-W1 SORA confocal head,
2.8× magniﬁcation changer, 100 mW lasers (40% power: 405 nm,
488 nm, 561 nm), and a Hamamatsu Orca-Fusion BT camera (2x bin-
ning to create 74 nm pixels). A piezo stage was used to acquire 10 z
planes/sample with a step size of 0.27µm. Acquired images were
analyzed using Fiji
80. For presentation, only one z plane was used.
tRNA sequencing and analysis
Chemically competentE. colicells containing either the WT retron or
the HNH-inactive (H71A) retron were transformed with T3 exonuclease
and grown overnight in the presence of 2% glucose and antibiotics
(chloramphenicol and streptomycin). Secondary cultures were inocu-
lated from the overnight cultures, grown to an OD
600 of 0.4–0.5 in the
presence of antibiotics, and induced with IPTG for 15 min. Total RNA,
including small RNAs, was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA
Miniprep Kit.
tRNA sequencing (MSR-seq) was performed by MesoRNA (Chi-
cago, IL, USA) as per previously reported protocol
81.T o t a lR N A( 1µg)
was subjected to deacylation by oxidation with sodium periodate
(NaIO
4), followed by quenching with ribose and treatment with sodium
tetraborate for β-elimination. The deacylated RNA was then end-
repaired using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK; New England Biolabs,
NEB) and ligated to biotinylated capture hairpin oligos (CHO) con-
taining sample-speciﬁc barcodes using T4 RNA Ligase I (NEB). After
ligation, all barcoded samples were pooled. The pooled samples were
captured on streptavidin-coated MyOne C1 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) via the biotinylated CHOs. Following capture, the samples
were dephosphorylated with Quick CIP (Roche) and reverse-
transcribed overnight using SuperScript IV Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). RNA templates were subsequently degraded with
RNase H (NEB), and cDNA subjected to periodate oxidation. After
quenching periodate with ribose, the single-stranded cDNAs were
ligated to the second ligation oligo and then released from the beads
by incubating at 95 °C. For each sample, 100 ng of puriﬁed cDNA was
PCR-ampliﬁed for 12 cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, 20 s at 72 °C).
The ampliﬁed products were puriﬁed using the DNA Clean & Con-
centrator kit (Zymo Research) and resolved on a 10% non-denaturing
TBE polyacrylamide gel with appropriate dsDNA size markers. Bands
corresponding to theﬁnal library size were gel-extracted and ethanol-
precipitated. The resulting libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq X
Plus platform using a 1.5Bﬂow cell (Illumina). Raw reads were demul-
tiplexed and processed by MesoRNA to generate tRNA count tables.
Reads were demultiplexed and trimmed in accordance with the MSR-
seq library preparation protocol
81. Quality control was performed with

FastQC82. Reads were aligned to tRNA sequences in GtRNAdb83 using
bowtie284 to generate tRNA count tables.
tRNA sequencing counts were normalized and subjected to dif-
ferential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package85 in R with
custom scripts. Fold changes in tRNA abundance were calculated by
DESeq2, which employs a negative binomial distribution model to
estimate dispersion and determine statistical signiﬁcance (p-value).
Northern blot analysis
Chemically competentE. colicells containing either the WT retron or
the HNH-inactive (H71A) retron, with or without T5 tRNASer-GCT, were
transformed with T3 nuclease and grown overnight in LB medium
supplemented with 2% glucose and appropriate antibiotics (chlor-
amphenicol, streptomycin, and kanamycin). Secondary cultures were
inoculated from the overnight cultures, grown to an OD
600 of 0.4–0.5
in the presence of antibiotics, and T3 exonuclease expression was
induced with IPTG for 60 minutes. Total RNA, including small RNAs,
was extracted using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit according to
the manufacturer’si n s t r u c t i o n sa n ds a m p l e sw e r er e s o l v e do na1 0 %
denaturing urea-PAGE gel run at 180 V for 90 minutes. Following
electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 1× TBE buffer for 5 minutes
and transferred to an Amersham Hybond-N nylon membrane at 30 V
for 2 hours. The membrane was then UV-crosslinked using a tran-
silluminator at maximum power for 5 minutes. For hybridization, the
membrane was pre-washed with 30 mL of pre-hybridization buffer (6×
SSC containing 0.5% SDS) for 10 minutes, then incubated overnight at
45 °C with 20 nM northern probes speciﬁc for 5S rRNA (FAM-labeled),
E. coli tRNA
Ser-GCT (ID700-labeled), and T5 tRNASer-GCT (ID800-
labeled) in 30 mL of pre-hybridization buffer (Supplementary Data 3).
After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with wash buffer
(2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 minutes each and imaged using an Amersham
Typhoon Scanner.
