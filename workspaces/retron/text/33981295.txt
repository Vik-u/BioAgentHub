Phage genome editing is crucial to uncover the molecular mechanisms of virus infection
and to engineer bacteriophages with enhanced antibacterial properties. Phage genetic
engineering relies mostly on homologous recombination (HR) assisted by the targeted
elimination of wild-type phages by CRISPR-Cas nucleases. These strategies are often
less effective in virulent bacteriophages with large genomes. T5 is a virulent phage
that infects Escherichia coli. We found that CRISPR-Cas9 system (type II-A) had
ununiform efﬁcacies against T5, which impairs a reliable use of CRISPR-Cas-assisted
counterselection in the gene editing of T5. Here, we present alternative strategies for
the construction of mutants in T5. Bacterial retroelements (retrons) proved to be efﬁcient
for T5 gene editing by introducing point mutations in the essential gene A1. We set up
a protocol based on dilution-ampliﬁcation-screening (DAS) of phage pools for mutant
enrichment that was used to introduce a conditional mutation in another essential gene
(A2), insert a new gene ( lacZα), and construct a translational fusion of a late phage
gene with a ﬂuorescent protein coding gene ( pb10-mCherry). The method should be
applicable to other virulent phages that are naturally resistant to CRISPR/Cas nucleases.

INTRODUCTION
Bacteriophage genome engineering opens avenues to investigate the role of viral genes in infection
and to generate bacteriophages with new properties. Until the late 1970s, genetic modiﬁcations were
only possible through random mutagenesis (Drake and Baltz, 1976). Recombinant DNA technology
later allowed the ﬁrst phage gene editing to be carried out in T4 (Völker and Showe, 1980). Since
then, continuous improvements of targeted mutagenesis methods were developed.
A ﬁrst strategy, BRED (Bacteriophage Recombineering of Electroporated DNA), aimed to
increase the recombination frequency between a template and a bacteriophage (Marinelli et al.,
2008) but it relies heavily on the compatibility of the recombinases with the phage to be engineered
and on a high electroporation eﬃciency, which is hard to achieve for phages with large genomes.
A second line of progress consisted in the improved recovery of phage mutants through
the elimination of unmodiﬁed (wild-type) phages. In phage T7, selection of phage mutants was
possible through the use of marker genes that are essential for phage infection in some host
backgrounds (Grigonyte et al., 2020). Although the strategy looks promising, its application
requires prior knowledge of host genes essential for infection, and the availability of suitable
host mutants. This technique is therefore limited to well-studied phages in model organisms. An
alternative to marker-based method is the use of CRISPR-Cas nucleases, enzymes that can be

Ramirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing
targeted to precise sequences thanks to their association with
so-called guide RNAs. CRISPR-Cas nucleases were successfully
used to eliminate the wild-type phages that have not undergone
HR and thereby enrich the phage population in mutant viruses.
Improved recovery of phage mutants was reported using type
I-E, type II-A CRISPR or type III-A systems (Kiro et al., 2014;
Martel and Moineau, 2014; Tao et al., 2017; Hatoum-Aslan, 2018;
Hupfeld et al., 2018). Despite these improvements in the reverse
genetic toolbox, some phages are recalcitrant to nucleases, either
by inhibition (Acr proteins protecting the phages from CRISPR-
Cas) (Marino et al., 2018) or by genome shielding (Malone et al.,
2020; Mendoza et al., 2020).
Finally, a third line of progress consisted in performing the
genome modiﬁcations in vitro followed by phage “rebooting, ”
where the entire phage genome is transformed into a recipient
bacterium to yield viral particles (Ando et al., 2015; Kilcher et al.,
2018). This bottom-up rebooting method requires a thorough
optimization of transfection conditions and is very ineﬃcient
for phages with large genomes. Another avenue for rebooting
could be the cell-free TXTL protein synthesis of phages in vitro:
synthesis of T4 from the intact 170-kb genome T4 was recently
reported, albeit with small yields (Rustad et al., 2018). Hence,
no universal method seems to emerge for the editing of phages
with large genomes.
Our laboratory studies bacteriophage T5, a virulent phage
that infects Escherichia coli and has a linear 121-kb dsDNA
genome. Most mutants in T5 were isolated in the past century
after chemical mutagenesis and screening for amber mutations
(Lanni et al., 1966; Hendrickson and McCorquodale, 1971). Since
the 1980s, directed mutagenesis of T5 was also performed upon
infection of host strains carrying a plasmid with the desired
mutation. Usually ca. 500-bp homologous DNA is provided on
each side of the mutation to favor HR. Screening of plaques was
performed by PCR (Golomidova et al., 2016) or hybridization
of radiolabeled oligonucleotides in stringent conditions (Vernhes
et al., 2017; Klimuk et al., 2020), a rather cumbersome method.
A recent report raised doubts about the possibility to use CRISPR-
Cas for T5wt counterselection: T5 was reported to escape the
CRISPR-Cas type I-E from E. coli. Accordingly, although most
of the spacers incorporated into CRISPR arrays mapped to pre-
early genes, only few of them conferred protection against T5
(Strotskaya et al., 2017). In this report, we tested the use of a Cas
nuclease normally absent in E. coli, i.e., the type II-A nuclease
Cas9, for restricting T5 infection. We also describe an alternative
method based on a scheme of dilutions for improved recovery
of mutants. Finally, we tested the use of retrons as another
template for homologous recombination. These strategies likely
constitute welcome additions to the toolbox for the phage
genome engineering.

with 1.5% agar for solid media. When appropriate, antibiotics
were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 200µg/mL;
chloramphenicol, 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 100 µg/mL. Prior to
phage infections, cultures were supplemented with CaCl2 (1 mM)
and MgCl2 (1 mM). T5 wild type (T5wt), T5 1dmp, T5 lacZα,
and T5 PNmC were propagated in E. coli F. T5 amA1 SS84,
T5 amA1 T28, and T5 amA2 S37 were ampliﬁed in E. coli
CR63, which codes for an amber suppressorCUAtRNASer. Plaques
were visualized on a double agar layer using molten LB agar
(0.5%) supplemented with the indicator bacteria and the phages.
For the blue/white screening of lysis plaques the molten top
agar also contained X-Gal (0.6 mg/mL) and isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 3 mM). For visualization of lysis
plaques, plates were incubated at 37 ◦C overnight and, when
appropriate, a further incubation at 25 ◦C for 24 h enhanced the
blue color of the plaques.
Plasmid Constructions
Plasmid pAC9 was assembled from plasmids pCas9, pBAD24 and
psgRNAcos (see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure 1 ) by homologous recombination (Jacobus and Gross,
2015). Vectors were linearized by PCR ampliﬁcation. PCR
products were digested with DpnI for 1 h at 37 ◦C and puriﬁed.
E. coli cells were transformed with 50 ng of each fragment and
selected in LB agar with ampicillin or kanamycin.

Ramirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing
For sgRNA cloning, sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides
(Supplementary Table 2 ) were annealed using a temperature
gradient from 98 ◦C to 20 ◦C at 0.1 ◦C/s, and then cloned into
pAC9 by the Golden-Gate method using the type IIs restriction
enzyme BsaI (Werner et al., 2012).
Plasmid pFFA1, used for retron-mediated mutagenesis, was
obtained by PCR from the plasmid pFF745 with primers 3087
and 3127, and subsequent religation in a Golden-Gate reaction
(Werner et al., 2012).
Plasmids used for HR were assembled with primers cited in
Supplementary Table 1. In all cases, pUCGG was the recipient;
this plasmid was obtained by PCR (with primers pUCF/pUCR)
using pUC19 as the template, followed by religation. Inserts
were ampliﬁed, puriﬁed and cloned in pUCGG by the Golden-
Gate method. The QuikChange (QC) site-directed mutagenesis
method was used to introduce speciﬁc mutations in the plasmids
when needed (Deng and Nickoloﬀ, 1992). pUCDdmp was
constructed by cloning PCR products from T5 DNA (with primer
pairs dmpF2/DdmpR and DdmpF/dmpR2). pUCA1am was
constructed by cloning a PCR fragment ampliﬁed from T5 (using
primers GGA1TF/GGA1TR) and the subsequent introduction
of a stop codon (QCA11/QCA12) at the A1 codon T28. For
pUCA2am, the ampliﬁed insert (ggpUCA2F/ggpUCA2R) was
cloned in pUGG and the A2 codon S37 was then changed
to stop codon (QCamA2F/QCamA2F). Plasmid pUC05-LacZa2
was constructed in two steps: the ﬁrst insert in pUCGG bears a T5
genome fragment comprising gene 05 ﬂanked by parts of genes
A1 and A2, ampliﬁed by PCR (05F/05R); the resulting plasmid,
pUC05, was ampliﬁed (pUC05-F/pUC05-R) to clone lacZα
(LacZalpha-ATG/LacZalpha-Stop) from pUC19. The EcoRI site
in lacZα was erased (QC-LacZ-Eco1) and a Shine Dalgarno
sequence was added (QCLacZSD1/QCLacZSD2) upstream to
allow translation. For pUCPNmC construction, two inserts were
fused, one from T5 (T5.151F/mCR) and the other one from
pET-PNter-mCherry (mCF/T5.151R).
CRISPR-Cas9 Interference Assay
Each host ( E. coli strains F or CR63) bearing a pAC9 with
or without the spacer against T5wt was grown at 37 ◦C in LB
supplemented with kanamycin, calcium, and magnesium until
an OD600∼0.4–0.5 was reached. 100 µL of serial dilutions of the
phage and 100 µL of the host were added to the top agar of a
double agar overlay assay in presence of kanamycin as well as
arabinose (0.4%) to induce the expression of Cas9. To measure
infection interference, the host and phage were E. coli F(pAC9)
and T5wt; for CRISPR-Cas9 assisted counterselection of T5wt
following mutagenesis, E. coli CR63 carrying pAC9-derivatives
was infected with the lysate from HR.
Mutagenesis Using Plasmid Template for
Homologous Recombination
The template plasmids used for phage mutagenesis are listed in
Table 1. E. coli CR63 was transformed either with pUCA1am
(to generate T5 amA1) or pUCA2am (for T5 amA2). E. coli
XL-1 Blue was used along with pUC05-lacZa2 to generate
T5 lacZα, while E. coli F was transformed with pUCPNmC
to generate T5 PNmC. Precultures of the cited hosts were
started from a single colony inoculated in LB with ampicillin,
shaken overnight at 37 ◦C and diluted to OD 600 ∼0.1 in LB
broth supplemented with ampicillin, calcium and magnesium.
Cultures were shaken at 37 ◦C until they reached OD 600 0.4-
0.5, and were then infected with T5 wt at MOI 10. After
10 min at 37 ◦C, cells were washed twice through centrifugation
at 5000 × g for 3 min and resuspension with LB broth
supplemented with ampicillin, calcium and magnesium. Cells
were harvested, resuspended at half of the initial volume, and
incubated at 37◦C for 90 min. Then 0.2% chloroform was added
to the culture, and following 10 min at 37 ◦C, the lysate was
centrifuged at 5000 × g 3 min. The supernatant was ﬁltered
with 0.45- µm cellulose acetate ﬁlters (Sartorius) and stored
at 4◦C.
Mutagenesis Using Retron
Overnight cultures of E. coli cells CR63(pFFA1) grown in LB
supplemented with chloramphenicol were used to initiate a 20-
mL culture at OD 600 0.1 in LB broth with chloramphenicol
and 1mM each of IPTG, CaCl 2 and MgSO 4. The culture was
shaken at 37 ◦C and 220 rpm until the OD 600 reached 0.4, and
then T5wt was added at MOI 10. After 10 min at 37 ◦C, cells
were washed twice and resuspended in half the initial volume
with LB supplemented with chloramphenicol, IPTG, calcium
and magnesium. Following 90 min at 37 ◦C, chloroform was
added and cell lysates were harvested as described above for the
mutagenesis using plasmid templates.
Screening of Mutant Phages
For the PCR screening of phages obtained after mutagenesis, we
performed a mismatched ampliﬁcation mutation assay (MAMA-
PCR) (Cha et al., 1992). The sequence of primers for the detection
of T5 amA1 (2772/A1Scr), T5 amA2 (05R/4050.2), T5 lacZα
(LacZalpha-Stop/A2ATG), PNmC (mCF/104870) are shown in
Supplementary Table 1. T5 1dmp mutants were screened with
primers T5:14-38F and 03ATG ( Supplementary Table 1), based
on the PCR amplicon size. Thermocycler conditions were set to
98◦C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 55 ◦C (30 s) and 72 ◦C
(1 min), and ﬁnally 5 min at 72 ◦C. PCR reactions contained
10 µM of each desalted primer (Euroﬁns), DMSO 1.5%, 1 µL
of ﬁltered lysate, and Taq DNA Polymerase 0.05 U/ µL with 1 ×
Buﬀer with KCl (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Dilution-Ampliﬁcation-Screening (DAS)
Figure 1 summarizes the diﬀerent steps in DAS. The lysate
was ﬁrst diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions to reach ca. 10–
100 PFU/mL (usually up to a dilution factor of 10 8 to 10 10).
Each dilution was performed in 10 mL of LB supplemented
with CaCl 2 (1mM) and MgSO 4 (1mM). A total of 50 µL of
each dilution were then distributed in twelve wells of a 96-
well sterile ﬂat bottom polystyrene plate (Corning), one row
per dilution factor. To amplify the phages in each well, one-
hundred-µL aliquots of a CR63 bacterial culture in exponential
phase were added. The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 ◦C
while shaking at 220 rpm. For the ﬁrst screening by MAMA-
PCR, we pooled 20 µL from six wells in the same row. Positive

pools corresponding to the highest phage dilutions were selected,
and the six individual wells were tested individually for the
second MAMA-PCR screening. Finally, 50µL taken from a PCR-
positive well were plated on a double agar to test 10-20 lysis
plaques individually.
Fluorescence Microscopy
To observe the production of the late viral proteins by
ﬂuorescence microscopy, E. coli strain F was incubated at 37 ◦C
in LB supplemented with ampicillin, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2, until
it reached an OD 600 of 0.4. To synchronize the infections,
the cells were chilled at 4 ◦C for 15 min. Phage T5 PNmC
was added to the culture at a MOI of 5 and incubated
for 5 min at 4 ◦C. The infected cells were washed by
centrifugation at 5000 × g for 3 min and resuspension in
LB. An aliquot of the culture was taken every 10 min and
ﬁxed with the same volume of PFA solution (Formaldehyde
5%, Glutaraldehyde 0.06%, diluted in PBS buﬀer) for 20 min.
Fixed cells were washed in PBS buﬀer (NaCl 0.14 M, KCl
2.68 mM, Na 2HPO4 6.46 mM, KH 2PO4 1.15 mM) twice by
centrifugation-resuspension. The cells were ﬁnally resuspended
in PBS and stored at 4 ◦C until microscopy imaging. Fixed cells
were deposited on thin agarose pads (1% molecular-biology-
grade agarose in PBS) molded on glass slide and observed under
cover slips with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1/7 microscope using the
ZEN software, version 3.0. The objective was Plan Apochromat
63x/1.40 Oil Ph 3 M27. The exposure time was 200 ms for
mCherry mPlum HXP (Ex: 587 nm, Em: 610 nm) and 20 ms
for phase contrast.
RESULTS
Restriction of T5 Infection by
CRISPR-Cas9 Depends on the Targeted
Locus
To test whether phage T5 infection is restricted by CRISPR-
Cas9, we transformed E. coli F with a plasmid coding for the
nuclease Cas9 and customizable sgRNAs. The sgRNAs matched
diﬀerent locations across the ﬁrst 10 kb of the T5 phage genome.
By double-layer agar method, we compared the titer of a T5
stock on two host strains: E. coli F expressing both Cas9 and
each sgRNA, versus the same host lacking the sgRNA. The
ratio of PFUs between the two hosts constituted the eﬃciency
of plating (EOP) and reﬂected the protective capacity of Cas9
against phages (Strotskaya et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017) for
each sgRNA. Restriction of T5 infection varied across the tested
region regardless of the DNA strand that was targeted (Figure 2).
Spacers with the highest interference mapped to the genes dmp,
02, A1, 05, and 07 and lowered the titer of T5wt between 10 and
100 times. The other spacers did not provide protection as the

FIGURE 2 | Restriction of phage T5 infection by sgRNA-guided Cas9. The restriction of T5 infection was measured as the efﬁciency of plating (EOP), calculated as
the titer of T5 on sgRNA- and Cas9-containing hosts versus the titer on the same host lacking the sgRNA. Titers were determined by plaque assay. EOP using
spacers matching the positive or negative strand were highlighted in black or blue, respectively. Each point represents the mean and s.e.m. from three replicas.

titer of T5wt decreased less than ten times. Therefore, Cas9 could
be eﬃciently used to restrict T5wt infection when it was targeted
to a region within the ﬁrst 4.5 kb of the T5 genome.
Bacteriophage T5 Genome Editing
Through HR Plus CRISPR-Cas9
In order to introduce genetic modiﬁcations in T5, we focused
on the region with eﬀective spacers. In the late sixties, Lanni
and coworkers described the isolation of T5 amber mutants
that could only be propagated in an amber suppressive strain
(Lanni et al., 1966; Lanni, 1968). Mutations were genetically
mapped to A1 or A2 genes ( Figure 2 ) but no sequencing data
were obtained to conﬁrm this ﬁnding. Therefore, we decided
to introduce a stop codon early on in the open reading frame
of the gene A1, resulting in the synthesis of truncated A1 (27
amino acids instead of 556). A 1-kb fragment of the T5 genome
was ampliﬁed and cloned into a pUC19 plasmid. This fragment
comprises 500-bp on each side of the A1 start codon in order
to provide ample homologous sequences on either side of the
desired mutation, and the codon for T28 in the insert was
replaced with a stop codon. Phage mutagenesis was performed by
allowing infection of E. coliCR63 carrying the resulting plasmid.
Counterselection of the T5wt within the crude lysate was carried
out onto E. coli CR63(pAC9-A1), a strain that expressed Cas9
and a sgRNA directed against the wild-type A1 gene at the same
site where the amber mutation was introduced ( Figure 3A ).
The crude lysate and CR63(pAC9-A1) were mixed prior to
plating onto double agar plate. The resulting plaques were then
picked and patched onto both E. colistrains F (non-permissive)
and CR63 (amber-suppressive). We recovered six amber mutant
plaques in 100 patched ones ( Figure 3B). Sequencing conﬁrmed
the introduction of the intended mutation in the T5 amA1
phages (Figure 3C).
The T5 genome has two long terminal direct repeats (ca.
10kb) that each include a copy of the 17 pre-early genes
(Genome accession NC_005859.1). To test whether phages
mutated in pre-early genes were modiﬁed on both terminal
repeats, we performed a mutagenesis to delete the dispensable
T5 pre-early gene dmp (Mozer et al., 1977). To provide a
template for HR, we generated plasmid pUCDdmp, that carries
a 702-bp deletion of dmp ﬂanked by T5 sequences. For T5
mutagenesis, E. colistrain F (pUCDdmp) was ﬁrst infected with
T5 and then CRISPR-Cas9 counterselection of the crude lysate
was done with E. coli F(pAC9_dmp) that produced a sgRNA
directed against wild-type dmp. PCR screening of 100 plaques
identiﬁed ﬁve plaques that bore the mutation (not shown). Using
primers that anneal to both terminal repeats ( Figure 3D ), we
could amplify a fragment corresponding to deleted version of
dmp (Figures 3E,F). Therefore, the genome modiﬁcations were
introduced in both terminal repeats. Taken together, our results
demonstrate that it is possible to use sgRNA-guided Cas9 to
facilitate mutant screening after HR in the genome of T5.
Bacteriophage Genome Engineering
With Retrons
We explored the use of alternative forms of DNA templates for
phage genome engineering. Bacterial retroelements or retrons are
chimeric RNA/DNA molecules composed of covalently linked
ssRNA (msr) and ssDNA (msd). Both msr and msd are coded
in the same cistron, altogether with a reverse transcriptase
responsible for the partial reverse transcription and linking of
the msr-msd molecules (Simon et al., 2019). These elements can
provide ssDNA in vivofor gene modiﬁcation, and were used for

2014; Simon et al., 2018; Figure 4A). We tested whether retrons
are also eﬀective for phage genome engineering. For the retron
template, we modiﬁed plasmid pFF745, which codes for the msr,
msd and the reverse transcriptase in a polycistron controlled by
an IPTG inducible promoter (Farzadfard and Lu, 2014). Part
of the msd sequence was replaced with a 75-bp segment of
the viral A1 gene centered on the serine codons for S84 and
S85. These codons were substituted by stop codons, generating
plasmid pFFA1. To introduce the mutation A1 S84Stop/S85Stop
into the phage genome, we grew E. coli CR63(pFFA1) in the
presence of IPTG and infected the bacteria with the wild-type
phage. For counterselection with Cas9, the crude lysate was plated

mutation (red box). Thus, retrons provide the cell with a source of ssDNA, that together with the Red-Beta protein from phage lambda, anneals to the target DNA
during replication. (B) Sequencing of the phage T5 amA1 SS84 constructed by retron-mediated recombination: puriﬁed amber mutant phages T5 amA1 SS84
obtained by retron-mediated mutagenesis were used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation. Amplicon sequences showed the presence of two stop codons instead of
serine codons (S84 and S85) in the T5 A1 gene.
the unmodiﬁed codons S84/S85 of T5 A1. Mutant screening
was performed by picking 100 plaques and patching them onto
plates seeded with E. coli strains F or CR63. We recovered 2
out of 100 plaques that could only lyse the amber-suppressing
host strain. Such mutants were designated T5amA1 SS84. Sanger
sequencing results showed the correct introduction of mutations
in A1 and no other alteration in the targeted locus ( Figure 4B).
Our results suggest that retrons could be eﬀectively used for
phage genome engineering.
Dilution-Ampliﬁcation-Screening to
Isolate Mutants From Phage T5
As we have seen above, some regions of the T5 genome are not
amenable to the CRISPR-Cas9 counterselection, a feature that
enriches the phage progeny in mutants relative to wild type after
mutagenesis. We reasoned that a similar enrichment could be
achieved with a simple dilution-ampliﬁcation screening (DAS)
(Figure 5A). As a proof of principle for this procedure, we sought
to obtain a phage carrying an amber mutation in the essential
gene A2 at the codon S37. We allowed the recombination between
the phage T5 and the plasmid bearing a mutated copy of the gene
A2 during infection. Following ﬁltration to eliminate uninfected
bacteria, the crude lysate was serially diluted from ca. 10 10
PFU/mL down to 10 2 PFU/mL. We distributed each dilution
into several wells containing the amber-suppressive host and
incubated for 3 h to amplify the phages ( Figures 1 , 5A). We
screened the wells by mismatched ampliﬁcation mutation assay
(MAMA)-PCR to detect the mutation and the positive wells were
plated by a double agar layer method to obtain individual plaques.
The plaques were picked and patched successively onto two plates
with a non-permissive and a permissive host, respectively. The
plaques that lysed only the permissive host were considered
positive ( Figure 5B ). We recovered 6 positives mutants from
50 tested, from which one was conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing
(Figure 5C). Since our estimation of T5 recombination frequency
is around 0.25% (see below), our recovery rate of 12% indicates
that we could enrich the mutant in some pools enough to simplify
the recovery of T5 amA2 S37 mutants. Hence, DAS is an eﬃcient
method for mutant isolation.
Blue T5: Insertion of lacZα Gene Into the
T5 Genome
Following the successful introduction of point mutations in the
T5 genome, we further tested whether insertion of exogenous
genes was possible. To generate a T5 phage that produces blue
lysis plaques, a 270-bp ORF encoding the fragment LacZ α of the
E. coliβ-galactosidase was introduced by HR between the genes
05 and A1 and DAS was used to recover mutants (Figure 6). The
T5 lacZα (Blue T5) plaques were blue when plated in a soft agar
overlay with the strain E. coliXL-1 Blue in the presence of X-Gal
and IPTG ( Figure 6B ). When we skipped the DAS procedure
and relied only on the blue/white plaque screening, we were
able to measure the frequency of recombination in T5 by HR.
We counted the number of blue lysis plaques obtained from the
ﬁltered crude lysate and found that 0.27 ± 0.01% (n = 6) of the
phages were recombinants, i.e., had integrated the lacZα gene.
In T4, the frequency of recombinant phages recovered following
infection of cells carrying the template DNA on a plasmid was
reported to be between 0.1 and 0.5% (Völker and Showe, 1980),
while in T3, it is comprised between 0.1 and 1% (Yehl et al., 2019).

wild-type phages in the crude lysates. In the ﬁrst step, dilutions of the lysates are performed to lower the phage titers and alter the proportion of mutants present in
each pool (above, second row). In the second step, phages in the diluted pools are ampliﬁed by adding the host. While the mutants remain scant within ampliﬁed
pools from initial high viral titers (below, ﬁrst row), the modiﬁed phages become enriched in the progeny obtained with some of the highly diluted pools (below,

Therefore, the frequency of HR in T5 is consistent with that of
other phages from the T series.
Phages Producing a Chimeric
Fluorescent Late Protein
To test whether our mutagenesis protocol was applicable to
another region of the T5 genome, we generated a gene fusion
between part of gene 151 and a reporter gene encoding a
ﬂuorescent protein. The product of T5 gene 151, the late protein
pb10, is a two-domain protein that decorates the surface of the T5
capsid. Although dispensable for capsid assembly, it contributes
to its stability under high temperature (Vernhes et al., 2017).
The N-ter domain of pb10 that binds to speciﬁc sites on the
capsid was fused to mCherry ( Figures 7A,C ). Mutant phages
were recovered and could be used to monitor the timing of late
protein production during infection by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
There was a rapid rise of red ﬂuorescence inside the cells after
around 20 min of infection ( Figure 7B ), consistent with the
expected late synthesis of the PNmC fusion.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we have edited the genome of bacteriophage
T5 and could generate mutants carrying point mutations, a
deletion or insertions. Template DNA for mutagenesis was
provided on a plasmid with ca. 500-bp homologous DNA on
either side to facilitate homologous recombination, a classical
method used for the genome engineering of many phages (Pires
et al., 2016). Here, we also chose to test an alternative template
DNA, i.e., bacterial retroelements called retrons. Retrons code
for mixed, covalently linked molecules constituted by single-
stranded RNA and DNA, msd-msr, which can provide ssDNA
molecules in vivo. They were successfully used for gene editing
of E. coli cells expressing the lambda recombinase Red-Beta
(Simon et al., 2019). Although the mechanism of mutagenesis
by msd-msr molecules remains unknown, it has been suggested
that the ssDNA produced from msd-msr cleavage replaces
Okasaki fragments during replication leading to the introduction
of modiﬁcations in the genome (Farzadfard and Lu, 2014).
Retrons were used in the past to modify the bacterial genome
upon exposure of the cells to certain stimuli (Farzadfard and
Lu, 2014) or to continuously target speciﬁc sequences in the
bacterial genome to drive evolution (Simon et al., 2018). To
our knowledge, our report is the ﬁrst example of phage genome
editing using retrons. Since the completion of this work, an
article described that some retrons, including the Ec86 retron
used in this study, provide protection against T5 infection,
albeit in a diﬀerent E. coli strain background (Millman et al.,
2020). Because the mechanism of host defense provided by
Ec86 retron was not studied further, it is not clear whether
the replacement of 75 nucleotides in msd by a heterologous
sequence is enough to inactivate the retron-mediated protection.
Therefore, prior to undertaking retron-mediated mutagenesis,
regardless whether the hosts are Gram-negative or Gram-positive
bacteria, it might be useful to test the eﬀect of retron expression

on the outcome of phage infection. In our study, the small
size of the homologous domain (75-bp) is incompatible with
insertions of large sequences in the genome but was suﬃcient
to successfully introduce point mutations in T5 (here two stop
codons). Nevertheless, mutagenesis with retrons oﬀers several
advantages. First, directed mutagenesis of cloned fragments is
not necessary since the retron’s small size allows the cloning
of annealed oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations.
Second, unlike the classical templates for HR, there is no
need to provide long sequences ﬂanking the mutations which
might encode toxic products for the host cell. Further work
will test whether retrons can also be used to construct gene
deletions in phages.
Reported phage homologous recombination frequencies vary
widely from 10 −10 to 10 −2 depending on the phages and
the genes that are targeted (Pires et al., 2016). These rates
warrant eﬃcient screening strategies of the phage progeny after
mutagenesis. One common approach is the targeted elimination
of wild-type phage using interference by CRISPR-Cas. Mutant
phages are thus enriched within the phage population (Kiro
et al., 2014; Martel and Moineau, 2014; Tao et al., 2017; Hupfeld
et al., 2018). Using Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting genes within
the ﬁrst 4.5 kb of T5 DNA, we were successful in isolating
conditional mutants in the essential geneA1 and a mutant deleted
in the dispensable gene dmp. Interestingly, PCR ampliﬁcation
showed that the latter mutant was modiﬁed on both direct
terminal repeats. Although the mechanisms for T5 replication
are poorly understood, duplication of a terminal repeat during
the packaging of concatemeric DNA has been proposed (Casjens
and Gilcrease, 2009). We speculate that, in the case of a
duplicated gene located outside of the terminal repeats, the
mutagenesis outcome would not have necessarily led to the
modiﬁcations of both genes.
Despite some success with sgRNA-guided Cas9, we found
that interference was not uniform when we targeted diﬀerent
locations across the pre-early gene locus, something similar to
what was been seen in T4 (Tao et al., 2017). While T4 DNA is
partially protected through the modiﬁcation of cytosines with
5-hydroxymethylation plus glycosylation, no modiﬁcation of T5
DNA has been reported so far. This resistance to CRISPR-
Cas interference was not limited to Cas9 nuclease: indeed a
recent study of the impact of CRISPR-Cas type I-E against
T5 showed that the few eﬃcient spacers matched pre-early
gene sequences but not the rest of the genome (Strotskaya
et al., 2017). These observations suggest that there might be
a generalized way, other than base modiﬁcation, in which T5
manages to escape CRISPR-Cas nucleases. A similar observation
in jumbo phages led to the discovery of a viral proteinaceous shell
that protects phage DNA from nucleases (Malone et al., 2020;
Mendoza et al., 2020). However, whether phage T5 uses a similar
mechanism is unknown.
For phages resistant to CRISPR-Cas interference, we have
established an alternative enrichment method by Dilution,
Ampliﬁcation, and Screening (DAS). The strategy relies on
the dilution of the viral progeny into parallel pools, followed
by their ampliﬁcation in the host. Screening of the most
dilute pools occurs using a discriminative PCR. This method
was successful in isolating conditional as well as insertion
mutants of bacteriophage T5. In this work we generated a
bacteriophage mutant useful to detect late viral gene expression
in ﬂuorescence microscopy of E. coli infected by T5. We also
used DAS to generate a phage carrying a 270-bp lacZα gene
among the early genes of T5. This phage was easily trackable
when infecting E. colicells designed for alpha complementation
of beta-galactosidase activity, since its blue plaques are easily
distinguished from colorless plaques. Using this phenotype, we
were able to determine the recombination frequency of T5, which
is similar to that of T3 (Yehl et al., 2019) and T4 (Völker and
Showe, 1980). Such an easily trackable phage could prove useful
in competition assays with other phages in the future. Finally,
we believe that DAS can document that some genes targeted for
mutagenesis are essential for infection, as the phages carrying the
mutation after HR will not propagate during the ampliﬁcation
step and therefore will only be abundant in the least diluted pools.
For this type of analysis, the PCR reactions should only allow the
detection of the mutation within the phage genome and not the
one provided on the plasmid DNA used as template.
Taken together, our work has shown that retrons and DAS
were successful tools in the mutagenesis of T5, a phage with a
large genome mostly recalcitrant to CRISPR-Cas nucleases. These
tools are likely welcome additions to the biotechnological toolkit
for phage genome editing.
