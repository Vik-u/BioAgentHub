Retrons are bacterial genetic elementsthat encode a reverse transcriptase and,
in combination with toxic effector proteins, can serve as antiphage defense
systems. However, the mechanisms ofa c t i o no fm o s tr e t r o ne f f e c t o r s ,a n d
how phages evade retrons, are not well understood. Here, we show that some
phages can evade retrons and other defense systems by producing speciﬁc
tRNAs. Weﬁnd that expression of retron-Eco7 effector proteins (PtuA and
PtuB) leads to degradation of tRNA
Tyr and abortive infection. The genomes of
T5 phages that evade retron-Eco7 include a tRNA-rich region, including a
highly expressed tRNATyr gene, which confers protection against retron-Eco7.
Furthermore, we show that other phages (T1, T7) can use a similar strategy,
expressing a tRNA
Lys, to counteract a tRNA anticodon defense system
(PrrC170).
Bacteria evade phage infections by utilizing an immune mechanism
referred to as defense system. The retron defense system is com-
posed of reverse transcriptase (RT), non-coding RNA, msrmsd, and
accessory protein or an RT-fused domain with various enzymatic
functions
1–3. RT produces satellite msDNA molecules using msd RNA
as the template4. There are 13 different types of retrons based on
their genetic structure and accessory proteins5. The accessory pro-
tein, which shows large diversity across different retrons5, is the
effector protein that acts to abort phage infection through the
inactivation of bacterial growth1. However, the defense mechanisms
of many retrons remain unknown. Retron-Eco1 from group IIA is the
only one among retrons for which the defense mechanism has been
characterized thus far
6.
Retron Ec78 (Retron-Eco7), a member of group I-A retrons,
utilizes effector proteins derived from the Septu7 defense system,
namely PtuA and PtuB (collectively referred to as PtuAB)1,3.O u r
research demonstrates that Retron-Eco7 employs its effector pro-
tein to degrade bacterial tRNA
Tyr, which is markedly distinct from
the previously characterized PtuAB from Septu, known for
degrading DNA
8. Discovered in the 1950s9, transfer RNAs (tRNAs)
are essential in the central dogma of molecular biology10.B yt h e
1960s, tRNAs were identi ﬁed in bacteriophages 11, and are now
known to be prevalent, particularly among virulent phages12.U s i n g
T5 phages, we showed that T5-like phages utilize their own tRNATyr
to rescue themselves from retron-Eco7. Further analysis using an
anticodon nuclease PrrC170 cloned from a clinical isolate also
showed that phage tRNA can be used to rescue phage from PrrC170.
In response to antiphage defenses, phages have developed various
counter strategies, one of which is to encode proteins that inacti-
vate the host defense
13–16. Our study highlights the importance of
phage tRNA in establishing a counterstrategy for the phage to
escape the defense system.

Escherichia coli phage ΦSP15
17, which has a high level of similarity
with T5j phage, a wildtype T5 from the phage collection of Jichi

in the genome of T5 obtained from NBRC (T5n) and the spontaneous
mutant of SP15 (SP15m)17. Each mutant was shown to carry an
approximately 8-kb deletion in their genome, which was later found
to encode multiple tRNAs and thus denoted as a
tRNA-rich region
(TRR) (Fig. 1a). Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the
prevalence of the TRR in T5-like phages (Supplementary Fig. 1, Sup-
plementary Data 1). We evaluated the ability of the phages to infect
bacterial strains that contained different types of antiphage defense
systems
3. In comparison with their respective wild-type strains (T5j
and SP15), both deletion mutants, T5n andΦSP15m, exhibited a
notable decrease in infectivity against bacteria carrying retron-Eco2
(Ec67) and retron-Eco7 (Ec78) (Fig.1b, Supplementary Fig. 2). The
TRR ofΦSP15 was further divided into nine fragments (Fig.1c), each
separately cloned into plasmid carrying the pBAD inducible
promoter
18. They were subsequently transformed intoE. coliDH10B
cells expressing retron-Eco2 or retron-Eco7 (Fig. 1c). The results
revealed that fragment 8 (F8 TRR) could rescue T5n andΦSP15m
from both retrons, whereas fragment 6 (F6 TRR) could only rescue
phages from retron-Eco7 (Fig.1d–f, Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). ORF75
of ΦSP15 was discovered to be the genetic determinant within the F8
TRR that enabled the phage to evade the Eco2 and Eco7 retrons
(Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). Meanwhile, tRNA
Tyr in F6 TRR
was responsible for phage rescue from Eco7 (Fig.1h, Supplementary
Fig. 4e, f). The function of ORF75 will be characterized in future
research. Hereafter we focus on the study of the tRNA
Tyr encoded in
F6 TRR.

PtuAB of retron I-A exhibits variations in the target molecule
As the inhibition of retron by overexpressing phage tRNATyr from F6
TRR was speciﬁc to retron-Eco7 (Fig.1e, f), we focused on retron-Eco7
to investigate whether our study could contribute to elucidating the
defense mechanism of this retron. Retron-Eco7 belongs to type I-A and
has two effector proteins, PtuA, which contains an ATPase domain, and
PtuB, an HNH endonuclease
1,3. We expressed the effector proteins
individually (PtuA or PtuB) or together (PtuAB) under the inducible
promoter pBAD. PtuAB, but not the singly expressed effectors, was
shown to trigger bacterial growth arrest, indicating that PtuA and PtuB
are toxins of retron-Eco7 (Fig.2a, b). To assess the speciﬁcc o m p o n e n t
within the retron complex capable of neutralizing the PtuAB toxin,
individual retron elements (msdmsr, RT, or PtuAB) were cloned into
two different plasmids and co-expressed. Following expression of RT
and PtuAB on separate plasmids, RT alone was inadequate at neu-
tralizing PtuAB. Both msrmsd and RT were required for effective
neutralization of PtuAB (Fig.2c, Supplementary Fig. 5). Thisﬁnding
suggests the presence of a tripartite toxin–antitoxin system in retron-
Eco7, resembling the previously documented retron-Sen2
2.
The RNA hybridization assay showed that the bacterial tRNATyr
was signiﬁcantly depleted by retron-Eco7 PtuAB overexpression or
during infection of phage (Fig.2d, e, Supplementary Figs. 6a, 7 and 8).
Next, tRNA sequencing conﬁrmed that bacterial tRNATyr, tRNATyrU
(tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-2), and tRNATyrV (tRNA-Tyr-GTA-1-1) were down-
regulated in bacteria expressing PtuAB (Fig. 2f, Supplementary
Fig. 6b–d, Supplementary Data 2). Taken together, these results reveal
that retron-Eco7 exerts its protective effect by aborting phage infec-
tion through the depletion of bacterial tRNA
Tyr via PtuAB. However,
future research is needed to clarify whether PtuA and PtuB are directly
or indirectly responsible for tRNA cleavage.
To assess the universality of this mode of action, we used
additional PtuAB variants from the same subfamily, type I-A, retron-
Eco4 (Ec83) (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). In contrast to retron-Eco7,
retron-Eco4 demonstrated a broad-spectrum defense activity, pro-
viding bacterial protection against a variety of phages (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9d, e). Subsequently, we cloned the PtuAB of Eco4 and
assessed its toxicity using the pBAD inducible promoter. Similar to
Eco7, the overexpression of PtuAB from retron-Eco4 resulted in
bacterial growth arrest (Supplementary Fig. 9f). However, tRNA
sequencing data revealed no downregulation of tRNA, suggesting
that PtuAB from retron-Eco4 does not target tRNA molecules (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9g, Supplementary Data 3). Although Eco7 and Eco4
belong to the same retron subfamily, theseﬁndings indicate that
their mechanisms of action differ.
Phage uses strong promoter to overexpress tRNATyr and coun-
teract retron-Eco7
As phage-derived tRNATyr (ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) in F6 TRR can rescue pha-
ges from retron-Eco7 (Fig.1h), we hypothesized thatΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15
neutralizes retron-Eco7. As changing the anticodon sequence ofΦtRNA-
Tyr_SP15 or mutating the stem-loop sequence ofΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15
abolished the neutralization effect ofΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15 (Fig.3a–e, Sup-
plementary Fig. 10a, b), we presumed that the function ofΦtRNA-
Tyr_SP15 in protein synthesis is essential for retron defense evasion.
Complementation of the exogenous tRNATyr by T5 tRNA Tyr
(ΦtRNA-Tyr_T5), Klebsiella phage KpP_HS106 tRNA Tyr (ΦtRNA-
Tyr_KpP_HS106), orE. coliDH10B tRNATyr (Ec_tRNA-TyrU or Ec_tRNA-
TyrV) in trans under the SP15-derived tRNA promoter (ΦtRNA-Tyr
promoter) successfully restored phage infection to that ofΦtRNA-
Tyr_SP15. By contrast, only partial recovery was observed following
complementation with theE. coli tRNA promoter (Ec_tRNA-Tyr pro-
moter (Fig.3f, Supplementary Fig. 10c, d), suggesting that the recovery
of phage infection is promoter-dependent. Through the insertion of
the red ﬂuorescence protein (RFP) gene under theΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15
promoter, we observed that this promoter displayed signiﬁcantly
enhanced strength in comparison to RPF expression under either
Ec_tRNA-TyrU or Ec_tRNA-TyrV promoters (Supplementary Fig. 11).
The supplementation of tRNA represents a strategy employed
by phages to evade different host defense systems
To investigate whether the utilization of phage tRNA is a widespread
strategy employed by phages to evade antiphage defense systems, we
extended our analysis to include the PrrC defense system
19.T h eP r r C
system was screened from the genomes of various carbapenem-
resistant bacteria
20 using Defense Finder21. We selected a candidate,
designated PrrC170, which was isolated from NIID carbapenem-
resistant K. quasipneumoniaeisolate number 170. The toxin gene of
PrrC170 harbors an ABC-ATPase domain and has 35% amino acid
identity with a well-known PrrC toxin, EcoPrrC (accession number:
EER4567187)
22 (Supplementary Fig. 12). We conﬁrmed that PrrC170 is
an active antiphage defense system against at least two phages, T1 and
T7 (Fig.3g, Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). We veriﬁed that overexpression
of the PrrC toxin under the pBAD inducible promoter led to bacterial
growth arrest (Fig. 3h). Subsequently, tRNA sequencing was con-
ducted on bacteria harboring the respective plasmid, ultimately elu-
cidating that PrrC speciﬁcally targets tRNA
Lys (Fig. 3i, Supplementary
Data 4). Complementation with phage-derived tRNA Lys (ΦtRNA-
Lys_SP15) resulted in a restoration of phage infection of bacteria car-
rying PrrC170, whereas complementation withE. coli-derived tRNA
Lys
(Ec_tRNA-Lys) showed low restoration of phage infection (Fig.3i,
Supplementary Fig. 13c). An additional complementation experiment
using phage-derived tRNA
Lys from various genera demonstrated that
these tRNA molecules enable phages to circumvent the PrrC170 sys-
tem (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c). Collectively, theseﬁndings suggest
that the supplementation of tRNA in phages represents a strategy
employed by phages to evade host defense systems.
In summary, our experiments with retron-Eco7 and T5-like phages
have provided mechanistic model regarding the retron-Eco7 which

employs effector protein PtuAB (Fig.4). Retron-Eco7 functions as a
tripartite toxin-antitoxin system, where PtuAB act as toxin genes and
retron msDNA and RT protein act as antitoxins. Upon phage infection,
retron-Eco7 may be triggered, leading to the release of PtuAB, which
causes growth arrest by degrading bacterial tRNA
Tyr before the phage
can complete its replication cycle. However, T5 phages likely produce
an abundance of their own tRNA
Tyr using a strong promoter, effectively
bypassing the degradation of bacterial tRNATyr and ensuring successful
phage replication. Further analysis has demonstrated that this tRNA
supplementation mechanism is not exclusive to retron-Eco7, thereby
broadening our understanding of the capability of phage tRNA to
counteract antiphage defenses.
We observed the co-localization of multiple tRNAs in the TRR
region. Given that defense systems typically co-reside with other
antiphage systems within a single genomic island

determine if other known anti-defense proteins may also be present in
this region. However, our bioinformatics analysis revealed that TRR
did not display many known anti-defense genes (Supplemen-
tary Data 5).
Discussion
Our investigation into the TRR led to the identiﬁcation of the cellular
target of retron-Eco7 effector proteins, PtuA and PtuB (collectively
known as PtuAB), which is tRNA
Tyr. However, retron-Eco4, from the

same subfamily, likely does not target tRNA. Notably, PtuAB is also
present in Septu defense system3,7,8,24. Unlike PtuAB of retron-Eco7,
PtuAB of Septu fromE. coliATCC25922 was reported to target nicked
DNA8, particularly the genomic DNA of phages, resulting in the ter-
mination of phage production. Taken together, PtuAB likely exhibits
variation in the target molecule.
tRNAs are known to be present in the genomes of bacteriophages
infecting various bacterial genera
12; however, their precise function
remains elusive. Several hypotheses have been proposed, and the most
well-known is codon compensation, in which codons rarely used by the
host but required by the phage are supplemented by phage-encoded
tRNAs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that phage-
derived tRNAs tend to correspond with codons that are frequently
used by phage-encoded genes
12,25. Recent studies hint at another
potential function of phage-derived tRNAs; they were discovered to be
used by phages to counteract the depletion of host tRNAs that occurs

as a widespread response to phage infection26,27. Our data showed that
T5 and SP15 phages can no longer infect bacteria protected by the
retron-Eco7 defense system when they lose tRNATyr in the TRR, sug-
gesting that the phage-derived tRNATyr is crucial for circumventing the
retron-Eco7 defense. Noteworthy, we have identiﬁed that the phage
utilizes an exceptionally strong promoter to express its tRNATyr,
implying that the phage evades retron-Eco7-mediated tRNATyr cleavage
by producing a high abundance of tRNATyr. To date, there have been
multiple reports on nucleases, such as VapC28,29,R l o C30,a n dP r r C19,
which are involved in the toxin–antitoxin system. They are also known
to target tRNA and are activated by various stress responses, including
phage infection

Fig. 4 | Proposed mechanism of T5 phages circumventing the retron-Eco7
antiphage defense system.The retron-Eco7 defense system operates as a tri-
partite toxin-antitoxin complex, where PtuAB acts as the toxin, and retron msDNA
along with RT protein serve as the antitoxins. During phage infection, retron-Eco7
may be triggered by an unknown mechanism, potentially leading to the release and
activation of PtuAB, which causes bacterial growth arrest by degrading bacterial
tRNA
Tyr, thereby preventing the phage from completing its replication cycle.
However, T5 phages produce an abundance of their own tRNATyr using a strong
promoter, effectively bypassing retron-Eco7 and ensuring successful phage
replication.

A recent study utilizing bioinformatic predictions identiﬁed
mutational patterns in the anticodon loops of tRNAs encoded by
mycobacteriophages32. These tRNAs are predicted to be resistant to
host anticodon tRNases. In line with our discovery of tRNA degrada-
tion by Retron Eco7, another group recently demonstrated that phage
T5 evades tRNA cleavage by the PARIS immunity through the expres-
sion of a tRNA
Lys variant33. We believe that while tRNA levels are
important, other factors such as the sequence and structure of the
tRNA, particularly the loop region, may also play a crucial role in the
ability of tRNA
Tyr to rescue phage from retron-Eco7. TheE. coli-derived
tRNATyr (Ec_tRNA-Tyr) and the phage-derived tRNATyr from SP15
(ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) differ in both sequence and structure, which could
inﬂuence how effectively they interact with retron-Eco7. These subtle
variations may enhance their ability to suppress retron-Eco7 activity.
To conﬁrm this hypothesis, further study is required, and we plan to
investigate this in future research.
Additionally, we have demonstrated that phage-derived tRNAs
can also bypass the PrrC defense system as well. We noted that the
tRNA
Lys used in this study comes from an unrelated phage, which
makes the experiment seem artiﬁcial. This was due to the limited
number of phages we worked with, speciﬁcally the T-series phages
(T1–T7). PrrC170 targets T1 and T7, but unfortunately, neither of
these phages encodes their own tRNA, making it difﬁcult to use them
as models. To address this, we decided to use tRNALys from several
phages that belong to different genera. Our results show that phage-
derived tRNA
Lys from various sources can help phages overcome the
PrrC system. Therefore, we believe that in nature, phages may use
tRNA as one of their strategies to counteract host defense systems
like PrrC.
Taken together, theseﬁndings strongly suggest the utilization of
phage tRNA to evade defense systems is a widespread strategy
employed by phages. Most bacteria encode multiple defense systems,
with an average of 5 systems per genome
21,23. This could be one of the
reasons why T5-like phages, which carry multiple types of tRNAs in
their genome, exhibit exceptionally broad host range
17.
We noted that the depletion of tRNATyr during phage infection was
signiﬁcantly different between bacteria carrying retron-Eco7 infected
with SP15 and those infected with SP15m (Fig.2e). This difference is
likely due to the presence of ORF75 in the wild-type SP15, which may
reduce the defense activity of retron-Eco7. However, we are currently
unable to determine the detailed mechanism by which ORF75 inhibits
retron-Eco7.
Methods
Media and buffers
All experiments were conducted using Luria Bertani (LB) broth (10 g
polypeptone, 10 g sodium chloride, and 5 g yeast extract per liter) or
LB agar (LB supplemented with 1.5% agar). Phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; 8.0 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na
2HPO4,a n d0 . 2 4 gK H2PO4)w a s
used for the dilution of the bacterial solutions, and sodium-
magnesium (SM) buffer (5.8 g NaCl, 0.2 g MgSO
4.7H2O, 50 mL 1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mL of 2% (w/v) gelatin solution) was used for
phage storage and phage dilution.
Bacterial strains and phages
Bacterial strains and phages used in our experiments are listed in
Supplementary Data 6. Defense systems were expressed inE. coli
DH10B. Bacteria were grown in LB at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm
unless speciﬁed otherwise, and the appropriate antibiotics were
added. Chemical competent E. coli DH10B cells were prepared
according to a previous study
18. For exogenous genes expressed inE.
coli, tetracycline (10 μg/mL), ampicillin (100 μg/mL), or chlor-
amphenicol (20μg/mL) was used to ensure plasmid maintenance.
Plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 9.
Isolation and preparation of phage stock
Phage SP15 was previously isolated from sewage inﬂuent obtained
from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tokyo using the
double-layer agar plating method
17,34 with E. coliO157:H7 as the pro-
pagation host. The SP15 mutant (SP15m) was previously isolated from
an in vitro co-culture of O157 and SP15 in the presence of fosfomycin17.
T5n was obtained from the Biological Research Center, National
Institute of Technology and Evolution (Tokyo, Japan). T5j was obtained
from the Department of Infection and Immunity, Division of Bacter-
iology, Jichi Medical University (Shimotsukeshi, Japan). Phages were
propagated and puriﬁed using a previously described method
35.
Brieﬂy, the puriﬁed phage was propagated by mixing 1% O157 over-
night culture in liquid LB and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Host cells
were removed through centrifugation (5000 ×g,1 0m i n ,4° C )b e f o r e
performing phage concentration using the polyethylene glycol 6000-
NaCl method. Finally, the phage solution wasﬁltered through a 0.2-µm
ﬁlter and used immediately or kept at 4 °C.
Plasmid and strain constructions
Plasmids carrying 33 different defense systems as well as one empty
vector (pLG001–pLG034)3 were obtained from Dr. Feng Zhang (Broad
Institute, Boston, MA, USA). Plasmids encoding retron Ec83 (Eco4) was
synthesized and cloned at Genewiz (South Plainﬁeld, NJ, USA). For co-
expression of retron and TRR fragment, the retron-Eco7 and Eco4 were
cloned under their native promoters using a plasmid with pSC101
origin of replication (ori). The TRR fragments for retron-Eco7 was
constructed using pKLC23
18 as a backbone with the pBAD-inducible
promoter and pA15 origin of replication (ori). TRR fragments for
retron-Eco2 were constructed using pKLC83
18, with pBR322 ori as a
backbone, along with the pBAD-inducible promoter. To construct the
plasmid carrying different tRNA
Tyr shown in Fig.3f, the oligonucleo-
tides of the tRNAs were synthesized at Euroﬁns (Tokyo, Japan) and
introduced into the plasmid using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, catalog number #E2621). The
plasmid carrying tRNA
Lys from various phages in Supplementary Fig. 14
was synthesized at Euroﬁns (Tokyo, Japan) under the pBR322 ori.
To construct a plasmid with the PrrC toxin–antitoxin (TA) system,
the presence of the PrrC TA system was searched in the genome of 400
NIID clinical isolates using Defenseﬁnder21.T h eP r r Cf r o mc a r b a p e n e m -
resistant K. quasipneumoniae isolate number 170 (NIID accession
number: JBEAAAI-19-0008) was used for further experiments. The
predicted PrrC TA system, which consists of four genes (HsdR, HsdS,
PrrC, and HsdM), including 300 nucleotides before the start codon of
HsdR, was cloned into plasmid pLG001. Plasmid assembly was per-
formed using NEBuilder® Hiﬁ DNA assembly (New England Biolabs,
I p s w i c h ,M A ,U S A ,c a t a l o gn u m b e r#E2621). Plasmid constructs were
transformed intoE. coliDH10B using the heat shock method.
To construct a plasmid expressing the RFP under the tRNA pro-
moter, we predicted the tRNA promoters using the BPROM prediction
tool (http://www.softberry.com). The predicted promoters fromE.
coli-derived tRNA-Tyr (tRNA_Tyr-GTA-1 and tRNA_Tyr-GTA-2) and
phage-derived tRNA-Tyr (ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) were ampliﬁed from theE.
coli DH10B genome and the phage SP15 genome, respectively. Therfp
gene, including the ribosome-binding site and therrnB T1 terminator
sequence, was ampliﬁed from the pKLC23-RFP plasmid
18. The plasmid
backbone was obtained from pKLC8318. The three fragments were PCR
ampliﬁed using Q5 High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (New England Biolabs,
catalog number #M0492S), and the plasmids were circularly assem-
bled using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly. Theﬂuorescence intensity
of RFP was quantiﬁed using the GloMax® Explorer Multimode Micro-
plate Reader (Promega, Madison, USA) and was subsequently nor-
malized with respect to the optical density (OD
600). The oligo primers,
synthetic DNA, and synthetic plasmid used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Data 6–9.

Bacteriophage spot assay
Spot assay was performed using fresh culture that was prepared by
inoculating 1% overnight bacterial culture into LB supplemented with
appropriate antibiotic(s) until an OD
600 of ~2 was reached. A bacterial
lawn for spot assay was prepared using 100μL fresh culture in 4 mL LB
top agar (LB, 0.5% agarose, 1 mM CaCl2)a n dp o u r e do n t oL Bp l a t e .
Phage was serially diluted using SM buffer in 96-well plates. Next, 3µL
of phage solution was tenfold serially diluted and dropped onto the
plate using a multichannel pipet and incubated at room temperature
until it dried, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. After over-
night incubation, formation of lysis zones (plaques) was recorded.
Efﬁciency of Plating of a phage is calculated by comparing the number
of plaque-forming units (PFUs) on a test strain to the number of PFUs
on a reference strain.
Cytotoxicity assay for PtuAB and PrrC
PtuAB from retron-Eco7 (pLG008) or PrrC from PrrC170 were cloned
into the pKLC23 plasmid under the pBAD-inducible promoter using
NEBuilder® Hiﬁ assembly (New England Biolabs). For PtuAB from Eco4
(pNK83), the PtuAB was cloned into the pKLC83a plasmid, a derivative
of pKLC83 with the pBAD-inducible promoter. The resulting plasmid
construct was introduced intoE. coli DH10B using the heat shock
protocol. A single bacterial colony that carries PtuAB was inoculated in
2 mL LB with chloramphenicol (for pKLC23) or ampicillin (for
pKLC83a) and was incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking at
200 rpm (until OD
600 was ~5). Overnight cultures were serially diluted
eight times (tenfold) in LB. Next, approximately 3μL of each dilution
was spotted on an LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics and
either 0.2% arabinose, 0.2% glucose, or no sugars. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C overnight.
TA assay of retron-Eco7
To identify the speciﬁc components within the retron complex capable
of neutralizing the PtuAB toxin, individual retron components
(msrmsd, RT, or PtuAB) were cloned into two different plasmids and
co-expressed. The toxin component, PtuAB, was expressed under the
pBAD inducible plasmid from pKL83a. The antitoxin candidate
(msrmsd, RT, or msrmsd-RT) was constitutively expressed under its
native promoter from retron-Eco7 (from plasmid pLG008). A plasmid
carrying msrmsd was created by deleting RT and PtuAB from pLG008,
while plasmid carrying RT was created by deleting msrmsd and PtuAB.
For cytotoxicity assay, a single bacterial colony that carries PtuAB and
antitoxin candidate was inoculated in 2 mL LB with chloramphenicol
and ampicillin and was incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking at
200 rpm (until OD
600 was ~5). Overnight cultures were serially diluted
eight times (tenfold) in LB. Next, approximately 3μL of each dilution
was spotted on an LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics and
either 0.2% arabinose, 0.2% glucose, or no sugars. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C overnight.
For toxicity assay of bacteria co-expressing the retron-Eco7
component in two inducible plasmids. The toxin component, PtuAB,
was expressed under the pBAD inducible promoter, whereas the anti-
toxin component RT/msrmsd/both RT and msrmsd were expressed
under the pATc inducible promoter. The antitoxin candidate was
continuously expressed by adding 50 ng/mL of anhydrous
tetracycline.
D o tB l o tR N Ah y b r i d i z a t i o n
An overnight culture ofE. coliDH10B harboring plasmid pBAD-PtuAB
from Retron-Eco7 was inoculated into 10 mL LB supplemented with
chloramphenicol (20μg/mL) until an OD600 of 0.3 was reached. The
bacteria were subsequently induced with 0.2% arabinose (to induce
PtuAB expression) or 0.2% glucose (to repress PtuAB expression) and
cultured for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Following incubation,
the culture was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 5 min, and the pellet was
washed twice with PBS buffer. Total RNA was extracted using a miRNA
isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog number #217004),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The total RNA was
submitted for dot blot RNA hybridization service of Genostaff Inc.
(Tokyo, Japan).
For the RNA dot blot analysis of bacteria infected with phage,
bacteria carrying pLG008 (retron-Eco7) or pLG001 (empty vector)
were infected with SP15 or SP15m for 20 min. Bacteria without phage
infection was used as negative control. The samples were then cen-
trifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and washed twice with SM buffer. The
bacterial pellet was subjected to RNA extraction using a miRNA isola-
tion kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog number #217004),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was
then submitted for dot blot RNA hybridization at Genostaff Inc.
(Tokyo, Japan).
Puriﬁed RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min and twofold
serially diluted. Diluted RNAs were spotted onto HyBond N+ mem-
brane (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA, Catalog number #RPN1210B)
and the membranes were baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Baked membranes
were pre-hybridized with DIG EasyHyb (Roche, Basel, Switzerland,
Catalog number #1603558) at 68 °C for 1 h followed by hybridization
with 10 pmol/mL of DIG-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to
target RNA for 15 h. Membranes were washed with 2× saline sodium
citrate (SSC)/0.1% SDS twice at room temperature for 10 min, 0.1× SSC/
0.1% SDS twice for 15 min, and with TBS-T at room temperature for
5 min. The temperature conditions for hybridization and washing were
adjusted according to the probe. Phage-tRNA-tyr-new-AS was set at
50 °C,E.coli-tRNA-tyr-AS at 60 °C, and 16S rRNA-AS at 60 °C. The
sequences of each probe are as follows: Phage-tRNA-tyr-new-AS: 5′-
DIG-AACCACCCGAGACCCTTCCGAGTCGG-3′, E.coli-tRNA-tyr-AS: 5′-
DIG-TCCCTTTGGCCGCTCGGGAACCCCACC-3′,a n d1 6 Sr R N A - A S :5′-
DIG-GATTCCGACTTCATGGAGTCGAGTTGCAGACTCCAATCCG-3′.
Thereafter, membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (Roche,
Catalog number # 1096176) at room temperature for 30 min and
probed with 10,000-diluted anti-digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments
(Roche, Catalog number #1093274) in blocking buffer at room tem-
perature for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-T three times at
room temperature for 10 min and rinsed with detection buffer (0.1 M
Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5.) Signals were detected using 100-diluted
CSPD substrate (Roche, Catalog number # 1655884.).
The dot blot results were quantiﬁed using ImageJ
36 software. The
quantiﬁed data were then normalized by dividing each value by the
average value obtained from the negative control. In Fig.2d, the
negative control was PtuAB without induction (Glucose added). In
Fig. 2e, the negative control was bacteria carrying an empty vector and
infected with phage. Statistical analysis for Fig.2d, e was performed
using thet-test available in GraphPad Prism software.
tRNA sequencing
tRNA sequencing was performed by Filgen, Inc. (Nagoya, Japan).
Sequencing, data curation, and bioinformatic analysis were performed
by Arraystar Inc. (Rockvile, MD, USA, project codes #J_120222-tRNA-
seq-16 and #J_190923-tRNAseq-16). Total RNA from each sample was
quantiﬁed using NanoDrop ND-1000 (Marshall Scientiﬁc, Hampton,
NH, USA). tRNAs were puriﬁed from total RNA samples and m1A&m3C
demethylated before being partially hydrolyzed according to the
Hydro-tRNAseq method. The partially hydrolyzed and re-
phosphorylated tRNAs were next converted to small RNA sequen-
cing libraries using NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for
Illumina® kit (New England Biolabs). Size selection of∼140–155-bp
PCR-ampliﬁed fragments (corresponding to∼19–35 nt tRNA fragments
size range) was performed. The resultant tRNA-seq libraries were
qualiﬁed and quantiﬁed using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Santa
Clara, CA, USA). We then equally mixed all libraries and sequenced for
50 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system using NextSeq 500/550

High-Output v2 kit (75 cycles) following the manufacturer ’s
instructions.
Sequencing quality was examined using the FastQC software, and
trimmed reads (passed Illumina qualityﬁlter, trimmed 3′-adaptor
bases by cutadapt) were aligned to the cytoplasmic mature-tRNA
sequences obtained from the GtRNAdb BWA37 software. For tRNA
alignment, the maximum mismatch was 238.T h et R N Ae x p r e s s i o n
proﬁle was analyzed based on uniquely mapped reads and including
mapped reads. The differentially expressed tRNAs were screened
based on the count value using the R package edgeR
39.P r i n c i p a l
component analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering,
scatter plots, Venn plots, and volcano plots were performed with the
differentially expressed tRNAs in R or Python environment for statis-
tical computing and graphics. The tRNA sequencing raw data and
process data for PtuAB from retron Eco7, PtuAB from retron Eco4, and
PrrC toxin of PrrC170 are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus
repository under accession numbers GSE229290, GSE256077, and
GSE256078, respectively.
TRR extraction from T5-like phages and anti-defense
protein search
A total of 250 T5-like phage genomes were collected using online blast.
Conserved upstream and downstream sequences of TRR were manu-
ally determined and the conserved sequence positions of TRR in each
T5-like phages were detected using local blast with ane-value thresh-
old <1e
−5. TRR sequences were extracted using the“subseq” command
option of seqkit. Extracted TRRs were annotated using prokka version
1.14.6, and tRNA encoded in TRR were detected using tRNAscan- SE
version 2.0.9.
Predicted anti-defense protein sequences in TRR were collected
based on previously reported anti-defense proteins
40 and are listed in
Supplementary Data 5. Homologous protein sequences were retrieved
using online BLAST to enrich the databases. Local blastp was used to
ﬁnd anti-defense candidate proteins with ane-value threshold <1e
−5.
