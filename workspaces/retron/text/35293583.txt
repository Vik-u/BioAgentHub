ABSTRACT
Retrons are bacterial retroelements that produce
single-stranded, reverse-transcribed DNA (RT-DNA)
that is a critical part of a newly discovered phage
defense system. Short retron RT-DNAs are produced
from larger, structured RNAs via a unique 2
′ -5′ initi-
ation and a mechanism for precise termination that
is not yet understood. Interestingly, retron reverse
transcriptases (RTs) typically lack an RNase H do-
main and, therefore, depend on endogenous RNase
H1 to remove RNA templates from RT-DNA. We ﬁnd
evidence for an expanded role of RNase H1 in the
mechanism of RT-DNA termination, beyond the mere
removal of RNA from RT-DNA:RNA hybrids. We show
that endogenous RNase H1 determines the termina-
tion point of the retron RT-DNA, with differing effects
across retron subtypes, and that these effects can
be recapitulated using a reduced,
in vitro system.
We exclude mechanisms of termination that rely on
steric effects of RNase H1 or RNA secondary struc-
ture and, instead, propose a model in which the ter-
tiary structure of the single-stranded RT-DNA and re-
maining RNA template results in termination. Finally,
we show that this mechanism affects cellular func-
tion, as retron-based phage defense is weaker in the
absence of RNase H1.
INTRODUCTION
Retrons are prokaryotic retroelements that have recently
been shown to play a role in phage defense (1–4). Retrons
consist of three components: (1) a reverse transcriptase
(RT), (2) a structured non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that is
reverse transcribed by the RT into single-stranded, reverse-
transcribed DNA (RT-DNA), and (3) and one or more ac-
cessoryproteins.Bioinformaticanalysesbasedonsequence
have identified more than 2,000 proposed retrons, account-
ingforupto ∼25%ofallbacterialretroelements,thoughto
datefewerthantwentyhavebeenverifiedandcharacterized
biochemically (5–8). Despite having only a cursory under-
standingofretronmechanismandfunction,thisRTfamily
has generated substantial interest for its ability to produce
single-strandedRT-DNA invivo,whichallowsforsynthetic
biology applications in eukaryotic gene editing (9), recom-
bineering (10) and high throughput mutagenesis (11).
Retrons employ a unique mechanism for RT-DNA syn-
thesis. The ncRNA template folds into a conserved sec-
ondary structure, insulated between two inverted repeats
(a1/a2, Figure 1A). The retron RT recognizes the folded
ncRNA and reverse transcription is initiated from a con-
served guanosine 2
′-OH adjacent to the inverted repeats,
forming a 2′-5′ linkage between the template RNA and the
nascentDNAstrand( 12–15).Insomeretronsthis2 ′-5′ link-
age persists into the mature form of processed RT-DNA
(16), while in others an exonuclease cleaves the DNA prod-
uct resulting in a free 5′ end (17,18).
Unlike viral reverse transcriptases, retron RTs do not
fully reverse transcribe their template RNAs as a means of
replication, but instead terminate at a precise point in the
middle of the retron ncRNA (Figure1A). This results in a
short RT-DNA product that varies in size by subtype from
∼40–160 bases. When isolated from cells, retron RT-DNA
is single stranded and degradation of the RNA template
has been shown to depend on endogenous RNase H1 (19).
Prior experiments suggest that RNase H1 cleavage occurs
quickly or perhaps is even coupled with reverse transcrip-
tion (19). In another study it was observed that in the ab-
sence of RNase H1 the length of Eco5 RT-DNA was al-
tered, but in the same conditions the length of Eco7 was
unaffected(15,19).Themechanismbywhichretronstermi-
nate reverse transcription is not well understood.

a role in RT-DNA synthesis beyond simply removing the
RNA in the DNA:RNA hybrid. We extend previous obser-
vations (15,19), finding a prominent effect of host RNase
H1 on RT-DNA termination, bothinvivo a n di nar e d u c e d
invitro system. Using this as a starting point to investigate
retron RT-DNA termination, we find that, in addition to
RNaseH1,preciseterminationrequiresthenativearchitec-
ture of the ncRNA. We propose a model in which removal
of the RNA template leads to a tertiary DNA:RNA struc-
ture that enforces termination. At a cellular level, we show
that RNase H1 is also critical for retron-based phage de-
fense.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All biological replicates were collected from distinct sam-
ples and not the same sample measured repeatedly.
Strain generation
Bacterial experiments were carried out in BL21-AI cells,
or a derivative of BL21-AI cells. These cells harbor a T7
polymerase driven by an arabinose-inducible promoter. A
knockoutstrainfortheEco1operon(BL21
ΔEco1)wasprevi-
ouslydescribed( 20).Anadditionalstrain(BL21 ΔEco1;ΔrnhA)
was constructed from that strain, using a strategy based
on Datsenko and Wanner (21) to replace the rnhA operon
with an FRT-flanked chloramphenicol resistance cassette.
ThereplacementcassettewasamplifiedfrompKD3,adding
homology arms to the rnhA locus. This amplicon was
electroporated into BL21-AI cells expressing lambda Red
genesfrompKD46andcloneswereisolatedbyselectionon
10/H9262g/mlchloramphenicolplates.Aftergenotypingtocon-
firm locus-specific insertion, the chloramphenicol cassette
was excised by transient expression of FLP recombinase to
leave only an FRT scar. Strain genotypes are listed in Sup-
plementary Table S3.
RT-DNA expression, purification and PAGE gel analysis
Constructs (Supplementary Table S2) were transformed
via electroporation into either strain BL21
ΔEco1 or
BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA. Selection for successfully transformed
cells was performed by growing the transformed cultures
on kanamycin plates. A single colony from the culture was
picked and grown in 5 ml of LB and 1 mM kanamycin,
shaking overnight at 37◦C. The following morning 100 ul
of the overnight culture was inoculated into 5 ml of LB
and 1 mM kanamycin and allowed to shake at 37C for
2 h during which the cells entered log growth phase. The
full 5mL culture was then added to 50 ml of LB, 35 ug/ml
kanamycin, 1 mM IPTG and 200 ug/ml l-arabinose. Cells
were allowed to grow for 5–8 h after which the cells were
pelleted and stored at –20
◦C.
To visualize RT-DNA on a PAGE gel the cell cultures
were prepared using a Qiagen plasmid plus midi prep pro-
tocol and eluted in a volume of 100 ul. 5 ul of the purified

Illumina multiplexed DNA sequencing
After the Qiagen midiprep, 86 ul of the RT-DNA was
treated with 10 units of RNase H1 (NEB) and∼20 ng

a single nucleotide, dATP, in a reaction with terminal de-
oxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (NEB). This reaction was

Three 10-base sequences present along the RT-DNA, spe-
cifictoeachretron,wasqueried,allowingforonemismatch.
All sequences containing at least one of those sequences
were analyzed for length.
For length analysis, the total number of reads that were
counted for each length was tallied and then normalized to
the total number of reads that contained any RT-DNA se-

quence(readsperlength /totalRT-DNAreads).Lengthval-
ues were then analyzed for relative frequency and plotted
into a binned histogram using Prism software.
To analyze the sequence that was reverse transcribed,
retron RT-DNA containing reads were exported as a
FASTAfileandassembledinGeneioustoasequencestart-
ing at the T7 promoter and extending to the start codon of
the retron-RT. Assembled reads were exported as a .csv file

DNA.

proach,fouroligonucleotideswerecombinedinequalparts

for sequencing with the same method as the retron-derived
RT-DNA. Sequencing reads were analyzed with a custom
Python script to identify the oligo sequence of interest.
The full oligonucleotide sequence was queried using fuzzy-
search, allowing for two mismatches including the unde-
fined terminal base. Each read that matched the oligo se-
quence was then binned according to its terminal base.
In vitrotranscription of Eco1 RNA and Eco1 chemical map-
ping RNA
RNA template was generated using PCR assembly by
primers designed using Primerize (22,23). RNAs were in
vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (NEB) in
RNA polymerase reaction buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH
7.9, 28 mM MgCl
2, 90 mM DTT, 2 mM spermidine, 1.5
mM each NTP and 40 U RNasin Plus Ribonuclease In-
hibitor [Promega]). The reaction was incubated at 37◦Cf o r
3 hours followed by the addition of 10 units of TURBO
DNase (Thermo Fisher) for 15 min at 37
◦C. RNA was pu-
rified using a Zymo RNA clean and concentrate kit.
Eco1-RT and DBR1 cloning and expression
Eco1-RT was cloned into the pSol-Tsf backbone from Lu-
cigen’s kit - Expresso Solubility and Expression Screen.
DBR1 was also cloned into the backbone but with an ad-
ditional His-tag between the TEV site and DBR1. Con-
structs were transformed into BL21-AI cells and plated on
an LB-kanamycin plate. A single colony was picked and
grown overnight shaking at 37
◦C in 5 ml of LB with 1 mM
Kanamycin. 5 ml of culture was added to 1 L of LB and
allowed to reach an OD of 0.5 shaking at 250 rpm in a baf-
fledflaskat37
◦C.ForEco1-RT,theculturewasthenplaced
on ice for 15 min. 1% arabinose and 0.02%L-rhamnose (1
ml of 20% solution) were added to induce expression and
culturewas allowed to shake at 18
◦Cf o r∼18 h. DBR1 was
induced with 1% Arabinose and 0.02%L-rhaminose (1 ml
of 20% solution) and culture was allowed to shake at 37◦C
for 4 h. Cells were then spun down and stored at –20◦C
or moved directly into the protein purification protocol
below.
Eco1 RT and DBR1 purification was achieved by resus-
pending the 1 L cell pellet in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol).
Cells were lysed once using the Misonix Sonicator 3000 on
power level 5.0 with 30 s on/3 0so f ff o r1 0c y c l e s .T h e
lysed suspension was then spun at 18,000 rcf in a Beckman
JL25.50 rotor at 4◦C for 30 min. Supernatant volume was
brought up to 50 ml with lysis buffer and 2 ml of equili-
brated nickel excel resin (Cytiva) and rotated at 4◦C for 3
h. Resin was then collected in 10 ml columns and washed
using 25 ml of wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM
NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 40 mM Imidazole pH 7.4 and 10%

Gels were run for∼30 min, stained with SYBR-Gold and
imaged.
Chemical mapping
Chemical probing experiments were carried out as de-
scribed previously (24–26). Briefly, 1.2 pmol of RNA was
denaturated at 95◦C in 50 mM Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, for
3 min, and folded by cooling to room temperature over
20 min and adding MgCl2 to the desired concentration of
10 mM. RNA was aliquoted in 15/H9262l volumes into a 96-
well plate and mixed with nuclease-free H2O (control), or
chemically modified in the presence of 5 mM 1-methyl-7-
nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) (27) for 10 min at room tem-
perature. Chemical modification was stopped by adding
9.75 /H9262l quench and purification mix (1.53 M NaCl, 1.5/H9262l
washed oligo-dT beads, Ambion), 6.4 nM FAM-labeled,
reverse-transcriptaseprimer,and2.55MNa-MESfor1M7.

RNA in each well was purified by bead immobilization on
a magnetic rack and two washes with 100/H9262l 70% ethanol.
RNA was then resuspended in 2.5/H9262l nuclease-free water
prior to reverse transcription.

After cleavage beads were spun down and supernatant was
collected and analyzed using mass spectrometry.
Samples were digested on-bead using LysC and trypsin
overnight at 37◦C without reduction or alkylation. Digests
were desalted using Stage tips packed with C18 disks (EM-
PORE). After vacuum centrifugation, peptides were resus-
pended in 0.1% formic acid. Samples were analyzed on a

for each of the phages and 2 ul drops were placed on the
bacterial layer.
Full plate plaque assays were set up on rectangular and

was mixed with 45 ul of phage lysate at a dilution deter-
mined to yield at least 10 plaques. On circular plates, 620
uL of the bacterial culture was mixed with 45 ul of phage
lysate. For a single T2/Eco4 condition on a circular plate,
we used 135 ul of phage lysate for both the experimental
and control conditions to achieve the at least 10 plaques.
After incubating at room temperature without shaking for
5 min, the mixture was added to 2 ml melted MMB agar
and poured onto MMB agar plates. The plates were dried
for 20 min at room temperature.
Plates were incubated overnight at 37

RESULTS
Endogenous RNase H1 determines retron RT-DNA length
Given that endogenous RNase H1 is required to remove
RNA, resulting in single stranded retron RT-DNA, we
aimed to test whether RNase H1 affects RT-DNA synthe-
sis across a panel of retrons. For this work, we used a B-
strainE.coli (BL21-AI)thatharborsanendogenousretron
(retron-Eco1). To create a clean background for the ex-
pression of multiple retrons, we eliminated the endogenous
retron operon, and then additionally removed endogenous
RNase H1 (rnhA), to yield the two primary strains used in
this work: BL21
ΔEco1 and BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA. To understand
the generalizability of RNase H1′s role in RT-DNA syn-
thesis, we analyzed the effect of RNase H1 on RT-DNA
synthesis in six retrons: Retron-Eco1 (Ec86), Retron-Eco2
(Ec67), Retron-Eco4 (Ec83), Retron-Eco6 (Ec48), Retron-
Eco9 and Retron-Sen2 (St85). These six retrons span four
RTClades,fromfourdifferentretronsubfamilies,withfour
differenttypesofpredictedaccessorydomains( 2,5).Clade,
subfamily, and accessory type for each retron are provided
in Supplementary Table S5.
Each retron operon, comprising of the retron-RT,
retron-RNA, and accessory protein(s), was cloned into
T7-inducible expression vectors and transformed into
BL21
ΔEco1 and BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA cells. Retron operons were
overexpressedandRT-DNAwasisolatedandvisualizedon
a TBE-urea gel. (Figure1B). In the presence of RNase H1,
all retrons generate RT-DNA products of approximately
the expected length based on previous literature - Eco1 (re-
ported as 86 bases) (33), Eco2 (reported as 67 bases) (34),

(36,37), Eco9 (reported between 50 and 100 bases) (1), and
Sen2 (reported between 50 and 100 bases) (38,39). Five of
the six retrons tested displayed dramatically different RT-
DNA profiles in the absence vs. presence of RNase H1.

PAGE gel analyses have been the standard in the retron
field, and provide an estimate of the size of the most preva-
lent polynucleotides in the population. However, PAGE
gels are unable to quantify the lengths of molecules in
a heterogenous population and provide no sequence in-
formation. Therefore, we applied multiplexed Illumina se-
quencing to the retron RT-DNA to provide a more quan-
titative and precise view of RT-DNA production across
conditions.
We isolated the RT-DNA producedin vivofrom each
retron and processed them for sequencing using an un-
biased custom sequencing method (20). Briefly, RT-DNA
sampleswereprocessedwithDBR1toremovethe2

ferent nucleotides at different rates (40), and, although we
were only using a single nucleotide for extension, we were
concerned that the identity of the terminal RT-DNA base
might skew our quantitative sequencing results. To test this
potential bias, we synthesized and sequenced three sets of
fouroligonucleotideswitheachofthefourpossibleterminal

Fordataanalysis,lengthsofsequencescontainingatleast
10 bases specific to the retron of interest were counted. A
binned histogram with the length of each retron RT-DNA
in the presence and absence of RNase H1 is shown in Fig-
ure 1C–F. Plotting the length distribution of the sequences
confirmed that all retrons produced a nearly homogenous
population of RT-DNA in the presence of RNase H1 (Fig-
ure 1C–H). In the absence RNase H1, the distribution of
the RT-DNA’s length was much broader for retrons Eco1,
Eco6, Eco9 and Sen2. Eco2 showed no change in length,
consistent with PAGE gel result, and Eco4 produced so lit-
tle RT-DNA in the absence of RNase H1 that it could not
be reliably prepared for sequencing. Based on these analy-
ses, endogenous RNase H1 consistently affects the length
distribution of RT-DNA molecules.
RNase H1 determines sites of termination in a retron depen-
dent manner
Visualization by PAGE gel and length analysis of mul-
tiplexed sequencing data show that, in the absence of
RNase H1, RT-DNA length is highly heterogeneous for
four retrons. This heterogeneity suggests that in the ab-
sence of RNase H1, the retron RT may load onto or fall
off the template at different places, skip and/or duplicate
various portions of the template, or continue beyond the
normal stop site. To distinguish between these possibilities,
we aligned the trimmed reads to a reference sequence con-
taining the retron ncRNA. The analysis showed that in the
presence of RNase H1, most retrons produced RT-DNA
with little variation in the site of initiation and termination
(Figure2).Schematicsshowcanonicalregionsoftheretron

ity during initiation at the 5′ end for Eco9 and Sen2 (Fig-
ure 2A, D–F). The variability on the 5′ side of the DNA
could be due to changes in the ability of the RT to initi-

We additionally compared our RT-DNA sequencing re-
sultstotheRT-DNAoftheseretronsfromtheirinitialchar-
acterization in previous literature, except for Eco9, which
does not have a previously described RT-DNA sequence
(Supplementary Figure S2A–F). The termination points
were as described except for Eco1 which produced RT-
DNA that was one base shorter than was previously de-
scribed, resulting in an RT-DNA that is 85 bases rather
than 86 (33)( F i g u r e2A; Supplementary Figure S2A). On
the 3
′ end, in contrast to what was previously reported, we
found that Eco6 was shorter by three bases (36) (Supple-
mentaryFigureS2D).Eco4andEco9produceunbranched
RT-DNA, in which the 2’-5’ linkage is removed, and
our data was consistent with the post-processing cleavage
point as previously described (1,35). We assume the dif-
ferences that we report in RT-DNA compared with the
previous literature represent a technical refinement gained
by sequencing thousands of RT-DNA molecules individ-
ually instead of using bulk assays, and not a biological
difference.

In vitrovalidation of RNase H1 as a requirement for correct
termination
It has been proposed that retrons form large complexes
(200–600kDa)composedofbothproteinandRNAintheir
bacterial hosts (41,42). Therefore, RNase H1 could be di-
rectly responsible for the change in RT-DNA length or be
indirectlymodifyingtheRNPcomplexbyrecruitinganad-
ditionalco-factor.Todistinguishbetweenthesetwohypoth-
esizes,weoptimizedaminimal invitro reversetranscription
assay from purified components.
First, we expressed a 6X histidine (His)-tagged Eco1
retronRTforpurification,withaTsfsolubilitydomainlink-
ing the His-tag to the N-terminus of the RT (Figure3A).
Retron Eco1 RT was expressed for 18 h at 18
◦C and iso-
lated using a nickel affinity resin followed by a size exclu-
sion column (Figure3B). Addition of the Tsf domain does
notaffectRT-DNAproduction invivo (SupplementaryFig-
ureS3A),thereforeitwasnotremoved.Next,Eco1Retron-
ncRNA wasinvitro transcribed using T7 polymerase (Fig-
ure 3C). To confirm that the purified RT was functional
and producing 2′-5′ linked RT-DNA, we performed anin
vitroreversetranscriptionassay,lookingforthepresenceof
RT-DNA by PAGE analysis. In this experiment, the com-
ponents were added to the reaction systematically and the
reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37
◦C. After 1
h, the sample was treated with RNase A/T to quench the
reactionanddegradeRNA.DNAproductswerevisualized
on a TBE-urea gel. We observein vitroproduction of RT-
DNA at the expected size in the presence of Eco1 ncRNA,
RT, dNTPs and RNase H1 (Figure3D).
In vivo, Eco1 RT-DNA is covalently linked to the RNA
v i aa2
′-5′ linkage (33). To confirm that purified RT also
produced 2′-5′ linked RT-DNA, thein vitroreaction was
treatedwithRecJ,a5 ′→3′ ssDNAexonuclease.Inthiscon-
dition, the RT-DNA persists, indicating the RT-DNA pro-
duced is protected at its 5
′ end (Figure3D). By contrast,
incubation with DBR1, an enzyme that cleaves 2′-5′ link-
ages,ledtoaslightshiftinsize,consistentwiththeremoval
of the linkage and the four bases of RNA that remain af-
ter RNase A/T1 treatment (Figure3D). In the presence of
both DBR1 and RecJ, the band was degraded due to the
de-protectionofthe5
′ endbyDBR1(Figure 3D).Together,
theseexperimentsconfirmthatthepurifiedEco1RTprotein
produces2
′-5′ linkedretron-derivedRT-DNAofthecorrect
length.
To test the requirement of RNase H1 for RT-DNA pro-
duction invitro, we performed a reverse transcriptase reac-
tion in the presence and absence of RNase H1. We post-
treatedbothreactionswithRNaseH1toavoidcomplicated
banding patterns due to single vs double stranded prod-
ucts and ran each reaction on a TBE Urea gel. Like thein
vivosystem, omitting RNase H1 during reverse transcrip-
tionledtotheproductionofalongerRT-DNA(Figure 3E).
By titrating the amount of RNase H1 present during the
reaction, we could modify the ratio of short to long RT-
DNA (Figure 3F). This experiment demonstrates that in
a minimalin vitrosystem, RNase H1 alone is capable of
modulating the length of Eco1 RT-DNA. Interestingly the
band found at∼140 is also sometimes present in in vivo
RT-DNA production experiments (Supplementary Figure
S3B), demonstrating that in over-expression conditionsin
vivo, RT-DNA may saturate the presence of endogenous
RNase H1 resulting in these higher order products.
SecondarystructureinEco1ncRNAisnotresponsibleforter-
mination
The loss of RNase H1 resulted in reverse transcription
past the canonical termination point in four retrons tested:
Eco1, Eco6, Eco9 and Sen2. One possible explanation is
that RNase H1 could physically block the progress of the
RT, preventing additional reverse transcription. To test
the steric blocking hypothesis, a catalytically dead RNase
H1 (RNase H1
D10N) was constructed by mutating one of
the conserved catalytic residues (D10N) (43). We replaced
the endogenous RNase H1 in the knockout background
(BL21
ΔEco1;ΔrnhA) with either RNase H1D10N or RNase
H1wt driven by a constitutive promoter and the Eco1 RT
drivenbyapromoterdrivingover-expression.Thepresence
of the RNase H1
wt rescued the production of Eco1 RT-
DNA at a single length when analyzed by PAGE gel, while
RNaseH1D10N didnot(SupplementaryFigureS4A).While
we cannot rule out the possibility that the D10N mutation
caused a slight protein structural change resulting in a loss
ofbindingtotheRT,webelievethatthemorelikelyexplana-
tionforthisresultisthatremovaloftheRNAcomponentof

Anothermodelforterminationhasbeenproposed,which
suggests that the retron secondary structure is responsible
for RT termination (44). When Eco1 ncRNA is foldedin
silico using RNAstructure (45), the termination site lands
inside a loop on a short predicted hairpin (Supplemen-
tary Figure S4B). To test whether this hairpin exists, we
evaluated the secondary structure using chemical map-
ping (Figure4A). In this experiment,in vitrotranscribed
retron ncRNA is exposed to 1-Methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhy-
dride (1M7). Nucleotides that are not paired have more
flexible phosphate backbones and therefore are reactive to
1M7, resulting in the addition of a bulky side group at the
2
′hydroxylofthephosphatebackbone( 46).Conversely,nu-
cleotidesthatarebase-pairedhavebackbonesthataremore
rigid and therefore are not reactive to 1M7. After the 1M7

To perform this experiment, Eco1 ncRNA was modi-

Conversely, there was a very high level of reactivity on the
insilico predicted hairpin where the RT-DNA termination
occurs between P3 and P4, suggesting that this hairpin is
not stably formed (Figure4B). Surprisingly, there is a lack
of reactivity in the bulge regions separating P4a/P4b and
P4b/P4c and a more complicated reactivity pattern is ob-
served between P1 and P4, where the RT-DNA synthesis
begins.Basedonthesedata,thesecondarystructurecanbe
moreaccuratelyrepresentedwithoutthepredictedhairpins

The chemical mapping results indicate it is unlikely that
astemstructureexistsattheEco1terminationpoint.How-
ever, it is possible that another secondary structure down-
stream is responsible for termination. To test this hypothe-
sis,weconstructedavectorwheretheportionofthencRNA
that is not reverse transcribed (msr) is separated from the
reverse transcribed region of the ncRNA (msd) and these
twopiecesareexpressedfromtwodifferentpromoterswith
theintentionofcreatinganmsrandanmsdintrans,rather
than their endogenous cis architecture. (Figure4E). While
we cannot rule out some read-through transcription that
would create one transcript, the msr and msd on that tran-
script would still be separated by more than 200 bases, in-
cluding a promoter, which we would consider to mimic the
intendedtransarchitecture.Remarkably,ncRNAproduced
from these two promoters is still functional for RT-DNA
production, albeit at a lower level than the cis construct
(Figure 4E, F). However, rather than terminating at the
canonical point, reverse transcription continues to the 5
′
end of the template RNA (Figure4E, F).

These results provide a different way to disrupt the RT-
DNA termination even in the presence of RNase H1, in-
dicating that the termination requires either a downstream
secondary structure or the overall tertiary structure of the
endogenous ncRNA. To distinguish between these possi-
bilities, we created a construct where an increasing number
of bases from the msr sequence of the ncRNA were added
back to the msd (template) in the trans architecture (Fig-
ure4E). If a secondary structure found downstream on the
ncRNA is important for termination, correct termination
should be restored when the sequence encoding this struc-
ture is included. However, these constructs never regained
the ability to terminate correctly, and only led to increas-
ingly long RT-DNAs (Figure4E). Based on these experi-
3500 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.6
ments, we propose a model in which the tertiary structure
of Eco1 ncRNA, rather than a secondary structure, deter-
mines the termination point and that removal of template
RNAbyRNaseH1isrequiredforthattertiarystructureto
form.
AbsenceofRNaseH1affectsaccessoryproteintoxinneutral-
ization
Bobonis etal.( 1) recently reported that the accessory pro-
teins often present in retron operons can act as toxins that
are neutralized in the presence of the retron’s RT and RT-
DNA (1,2). Retron accessory proteins were categorized
based on their domains’ predicted function (5). The ac-
cessory proteins of Eco1, Eco9 and Sen2 are predicted
to have N-terminal nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase-like
(NDT) and C-terminal DNA binding domains (5). Eco2
is fused to its accessory protein which is predicted to be a
topoisomerase-primase domain (5). Eco4
′s accessory pro-
tein is predicted to have ATPase and Walker A and B mo-
tifs (5). Eco6 has an accessory protein that is predicted to
be an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane
helices (5).
WefoundevidencethattheRTandtheaccessoryprotein
in retron Eco1 interact, either directly or as part of a com-
plex,basedonmassspectroscopyanalysisofFLAG-tagged,
overexpressedEco1-RT,whichco-immunoprecipitateswith
endogenous accessory protein, similar to what is observed
in Sen2 (1) (Supplementary Figure S5). However, whether
the RT-DNA interacts with the accessory protein as part
of this neutralization is unknown. Given that removal
of RNase H1 modifies the RT-DNA produced, we won-
dered whether it would affect toxin neutralization. To test
this, we generated inducible constructs that contained ei-
ther the retron accessory protein alone or the full retron
operon for three different families of RT-accessory protein
pairs, represented by Eco1, Eco4, Eco6, and Eco9/Sen2.
EachconstructwasthentransformedintoeitherBL21
ΔEco1
or BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA. Cells were grown in either the presence
or absence of inducers over 24 h at room temperature, and
the effect of each construct on cell growth was assessed by
measuring the optical density (Figure5A).
Surprisingly, the Eco1 and Eco6 accessory proteins did
not appear to be toxic, as the full operon and accessory
protein only strains grew to the same relative density (Fig-
ure 5B, C). In contrast, the Eco4 accessory protein had a
very strong toxic effect on cell growth (Figure5D). The
growth defect caused by the accessory protein was largely
neutralized by expressing the full operon, similar to what
has been previously reported for Eco9 and Sen2 (1). When
the Eco4 accessory protein only constructs were expressed
in BL21
ΔEco1;ΔrnhA, a toxic affect was also observed and,
again, this toxic effect was mitigated by expressing the
full operon (Figure5E). We next analyzed the degree of
toxin neutralization by the full operon in each strain, de-
fined as the full operon OD
600 ratio (induced/uninduced)
overtheaccessoryaloneOD 600 ratio(induced/uninduced).
We found that the degree of toxin neutralization in the
BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA strain was lower than in the BL21ΔEco1
strain (Figure5F). A similar effect was observed for Eco9
andSen2.Theaccessoryproteinconstructsexhibitedatoxic
effectoncellgrowththatislargelyneutralizedwhenthefull
o p e r o ni se x p r e s s e d( F i g u r e5G, J), and both the toxic ef-
fect and neutralization persist in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain
(Figure5H,K).However,thedegreeoftoxinneutralization
is reduced in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain compared to the
BL21ΔEco1 strain (Figure5I, L). We conclude that RNase
H1 is required for maximal accessory neutralization in
retrons where the accessory has a toxic phenotype.
Absence of RNase H1 inhibits retron-based phage defense
Retrons have been shown to confer defense against phages,
whichrequiresallthreecomponents:RT,RT-DNAandac-

andbacteriawereallowedtogrowovernight.Plaqueforma-
tionacrossthistitrationyieldedaninitialqualitativeassess-
ment of the overall effect that each construct had on phage
growth and enabled us to identify the appropriate phage
concentration for more quantitative analysis (Figure6B).
For quantitative analysis, bacterial cultures were plated
in the presence of phage at a concentration that allowed
at least ten distinct plaques to form, and plaques were
counted blind to condition. Eco1 in both the BL21
ΔEco1
or BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAconditions displayed no difference in
phage defense between the ncRNA/RT and full operon
constructsagainstT2phage(Figure 6C–E).However,Eco1
did display defense against T5, consistent with previous
reports, with far fewer plaques when the full operon was
expressed than the ncRNA/RT was expressed alone (Fig-
ure 6F–H) (2). This defense phenotype was reduced in
the BL21
ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain as compared with the BL21ΔEco1
strain, indicating a role for RNase H1 in retron phage de-
fense.
We found that the full Eco4 operon yielded significant
defense against T5 versus the ncRNA/RT alone, though
prior work suggests that Eco4 defends against T2, but not
T5 (2). For Eco4, like Eco1, the magnitude of defense
against T5 was lower in the BL21
ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain than in
theBL21ΔEco1 strain(Figure 6I–N).Aphagephenotypefor
Eco9hasnotbeenpreviouslyestablished.Ourdatademon-
strate that the full Eco9 operon defends modestly against
T2 (Figure6O–T) and that this defense is also significantly
diminished in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA strain compared to the
BL21ΔEco1strain. Overall, these results point to a general
role for RNase H1 in retron-based phage defense across
retron subtypes and phages.

pending on the specific retron. Additionally, we character-
ized RT-DNA from six retrons using multiplexed sequenc-
ing to provide a quantitative characterization of the RT-
DNA population in the presence and absence of RNase
H1. The most severely affected retron is Eco4, where RT-
DNA is nearly eliminated in the absence of RNase H1.
Eco1, Eco6, Eco9 and Sen2 all generate RT-DNA prod-
ucts of non-canonical lengths, reminiscent of early exper-
iments with Eco5 (14,15), whereas Eco2 is unaffected by
RNase H1, similar to what was previously observed for
Eco7 (14,15).
We advance the understanding of retron termination,
showing that termination is not mediated by a steric effect
ofRNaseH1,orbysecondarystructureofthencRNA.In-
stead, we propose that termination is mediated by tertiary
structurethatformsuponremovalofthetemplateRNAby
RNase H1. Finally, we show that not all retron accessory

activity of RNase H1 affects ability of the retron to defend
bacterial populations against phages.
These experiments also yield insight into the specific
mechanism of Eco1 termination. We performed experi-
ments to test a previously proposed model in which sec-
ondary structure mediates termination (44). Our data does
not support this model for Eco1 based on both direct eval-
uation of ncRNA secondary structure and the absence of
termination in the circularly permutated constructs. We in-
stead propose a model in which termination in Eco1 is
achievedthroughthetertiaryfoldingofthesingle-stranded
RT-DNA/ncRNA template region. Supporting this hy-
pothesis is the lack of reactivity in the bulge regions be-
tween P4a/b/c and the complex reactivity observed be-
tweenregionP1 /4andP3 /4intheEco1ncRNA.Addition-
ally,retronterminationwasaffectedbyboththeabsenceof
RNase H1 and the separation of the msr (primer) and msd
(template) components of the ncRNA. These data are uni-
fied in a model where the single-stranded RT-DNA and re-
mainingncRNAscaffoldfoldsintoatertiarystructurethat
enforces precise termination.
Whiletheproposedmodelofatoxiceffectinducedbythe
accessoryproteinforphagedefensewassupportedbyEco4
andEco9,notoxicphenotypewasshownforaccessorypro-
teins of Eco1 and Eco6. This is not simply explained by ac-
cessory protein domain category, as Eco1 and Eco9 share
thesameaccessoryproteinneutralizationfamily(predicted
NDT-DNA binding domain), whereas Eco6 is in an en-
tirely different family (two transmembrane integral mem-
brane protein). Interestingly, despite this lack of a toxic ef-
fect,Eco1stillexhibitedastrongphagedefenseagainstT5.
Takentogether,thisdemonstratesthatthecurrentmodelfor
retron-based phage defense and the mechanism of action
foraccessoryproteins,evenamongsimilarfamilymembers,
is not universally applicable to all retrons.
It is interesting that the phage defense is reduced, but
not entirely eliminated by the RNase H1 effect that sub-
stantially changes the RT-DNA. We interpret the effect
of RNase H1 on toxicity to indicate that the fully single-
stranded RT-DNA of the correct length is most effective in
neutralizingtheaccessoryprotein.Weassumethatasimilar
mechanism underlies the effect on phage defense, although
that mechanism must differ slightly in ways that we do not
yet understand in systems like Eco1 where the accessory
protein is not a direct toxin. The remaining phage defense
may be due to a small fraction of RT-DNA molecules that
are accurately produced even in the absence of RNase H1,
or could indicate a diminished, but not eliminated role, for
the inaccurate RT-DNA in phage defense.
