ABSTRACT
Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are found in different
systems including group II introns, Diversity Gen-
erating Retroelements (DGRs), retrons, CRISPR-Cas
systems, and Abortive Infection (Abi) systems in
prokaryotes. Different classes of RTs can play dif-
ferent roles, such as template switching and mobil-
ity in group II introns, spacer acquisition in CRISPR-
Cas systems, mutagenic retrohoming in DGRs, pro-
grammed cell suicide in Abi systems, and recently
discovered phage defense in retrons. While some
classes of RTs have been studied extensively, oth-
ers remain to be characterized. There is a lack of
computational tools for identifying and characteriz-
ing various classes of RTs. In this study, we built a
tool (called myRT) for identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation
of prokaryotic RTs. In addition, our tool provides in-
formation about the genomic neighborhood of each
RT, providing potential functional clues. We applied
our tool to predict RTs in all complete and draft bac-
terial genomes, and created a collection that can be
used for exploration of putative RTs and their as-
sociated protein domains. Application of myRT to
metagenomes showed that gut metagenomes en-
code proportionally more RTs related to DGRs, out-
numbering retron-related RTs, as compared to the
collection of reference genomes. MyRT is both avail-
able as a standalone software (https://github.com/
mgtools/myRT) and also through a website (https:
//omics.informatics.indiana.edu/myRT/).
INTRODUCTION
A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme that converts
RNA into double stranded cDNA, and was discovered in
1970 in retroviruses (1). A well-known RT in retroviruses is
HIV-1 RT, with DNA polymerase and RNase H enzymatic
activities(2).Alltheretrotransposons(LTRandnon-LTR)
have RT genes (3). Bacterial RTs were first found in retrons
retroelements. Bacterial RTs can also be found in bacte-
rial defense systems against phages, e.g. in CRISPR-Cas
systems and abortive infection systems (AbiA, AbiK and
AbiP2) (4). RTs are also found in Diversity Generating
Retroelements (DGRs) that facilitate tropism switching in
phages,andacceleratetheevolutionofbacteriaandarchaea
(5).AnotherimportantclassofRTscanbefoundinmobile
retroelements such as group II introns (GII/G2I) (6).
RTs involved in group II introns are the most abundant
classofRTsinbacteria,andencode57–75%ofthebacterial
RTs (4,6).BacterialgroupIIintronsareself-splicingmobile

mains(4,7).GroupIIintronRTsandtheirtemplateswitch-
ingmechanismsareusedindifferentgeneandgenomeedit-
ingtechniquesincludingtargetronandthermotargetron( 8–
11).
Retrons encode 12–14% of the bacterial RTs and are
the second most frequent class of RTs (4,6). Although
retrons were discovered three decades ago, their function
remained unknown until recently that they were found to
function as phage defense mechanisms (12,13). Bacterial
retronsarenon-LTR-retroelementsthatproducemulticopy
single-stranded DNAs (msDNAs). Most retrons consist of
msr-msd sequence and a RT gene. Retrons can also encode
toxin/antitoxin systems, which can be triggered or blocked
by phage proteins (14,15). Retron RTs have been sug-
gested as a tool for precise genome editing techniques (e.g.
CRISPEY, SCRIBE and HiSCRIBE) as retrons can pro-
duce msDNA, and edit the target sequences (6,
11,16,17).
RTgenesareanessentialcomponentofDiversityGener-
ating Retroelements (DGRs) (18). DGRs are found in bac-
teria, archaea and phages (19). DGRs are beneficial to the
evolution and survival of their host; for instances, they can
mediate tropism switching in Bordetella phage (20), medi-
ate bacterial surface display (21), have a role in regulatory
pathway tuning (22), and impact the underlying temper-
ate phage-bacteria interactions in human gut microbiome

(23,24). RTs in DGR systems are special, in the sense that
they are error-prone. The RTs generate hyper-variable re-
gions in specific target genes (e.g., genes encoding for tail
fibre proteins and receptors), through a process called mu-
tagenic retrohoming in which a template region (TR) is re-
versed transcribed into mutagenized cDNA(A-to-Nmuta-
tions),andthemutagenizedcDNAreplacesaregion(called
variableregion,VR)inthetargetgenewhichissimilartothe
TRregion( 5).AnalysesofthetargetgenesofDGRsystems
have shown that some pfam domains commonly encoded
by target genes include, but are not limited to DUF1566,
FGE-sulfatase, and Fib
succ major (25).
RTs are also found in three types of abortive bacterio-
phage infection (Abi) systems including AbiA, AbiK and
AbiP2 (4,26,27). Abi systems are a type of bacterial de-
fense mechanisms that can lead to programmed death of
a phage-infected cell, in order to protect the surrounding
cell(s), and are often encoded by phages (e.g. P2 prophage
of E.coli), and plasmids of bacterial genomes such asLac-
tococcus lactis(28). L. lactishas more than 22 different
abortive infection systems (AbiA to AbiV) (29), among
which, only two of them (AbiA and Abik) have a RT do-
main. Although AbiA and AbiK only share 23% identity,
they both can stop phage P335 maturation by means of
un-templatedsynthesisofaDNAcovalentlybondedtothe
reverse transcriptase domain in order to target the Rad52-
likephagerecombinases( 30).C-terminalHEPNdomainof
AbiA(HEPN
AbiA CTD),whichmaypromotecellsuicide
through RNase activity, is fused to RT encoded by a gene
foundinanoperoncontainingothergenesincludingrestric-
tion modification system (RM system) (29).
RT genes are found in some classes of CRISPR-Cas (the
bacterial adaptive immune) systems including several sub-
setsoftypeIII(III-A,III-B,III-C,andIII-D)andtypeVI-
A CRISPR-Cas systems that can acquire spacers directly
from both DNA and RNA (31). RNA spacer acquisition
hasbeenusedinmethodssuchasRecord-seqfortranscrip-
tional recording (11,32,33). CRISPR-Cas RTs are believed
to have been emerged from multiple occasions: CRISPR-
Cas RTs in archaea (Methanomicrobia) branch from class
F of group II introns, CRISPR-Cas RT (ABX04564.1) in
Herpetosiphon aurantiacusfalls into the group II intron
clade, CRISPR-Cas RT inHaliscomenobacter hydrossisis
relatedtoretronR T s(34).CRISPR-CasRTin Haemophilus
haemolyticus is related to AbiP2 RTs, and is associated
with type I-C CRISPR-Cas systems (35). These are the
examples showing association of Retron and AbiP2 RTs
with CRISPR-Cas systems.Streptomycesspp. has several
CRISPR-Cas RTs associated with type I-E CRISPR sys-
tems. As RNA activity is not common in type I CRISPR
systems,experimentalstudyoftheseCRISPR-CasRTsmay
result in interesting findings (36).
Uncharacterized RTs are encoded by conserved ORFs
in bacterial genomes, but their exact function and classifi-
cation are unknown. Nevertheless, a few studies have sug-
gested groupings of these RTs based on different criteria
suchaspreviouslypublisheddata,sequenceconservationof
the RT motifs, and similarity of their fused protein motifs
(4,6,37). The genomic neighborhood of these RTs can also
provide us with information about the functions of these
RTs:forinstance,RTsofunknownclasses1and5arefused
withnitrilasemotifintheC-terminal,RTsofunknownclass
3 and class 8 tend to co-occur, unknown class 4 RTs have a
fimbrial domain, and unknown class 10 of RTs have fused
primase domain, suggesting a concerted priming and re-
verse by the protein that harbors these two domains (6).
Despitethegrouping,afewRTsremainunclassifiedasthey

in the collected dataset of RTs (6). A recent study, discov-
ered that six classes of unknown RTs, including unknown

Due to the importance and applicability of bacterial re-
versetranscriptases,therearetoolsanddatabasesthathave
beendevelopedforindividualclassesofRTs,orgeneticele-
ments that contain the RTs. There is a database of group II
introns (http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/groupii/)(39,40). My-
DGRisatoolthatwedevelopedforidentificationofDGR
systems and their associated RTs (5). However, a tool for
characterization and classification of RTs remains lacking.
We provide here the first pipeline for prediction of bacte-
rial RTs and their classes, accompanied by genomic neigh-
borhood information and visualizations. Furthermore, our
pre-computedcollectionofputativeRTsinallcompleteand
bacterial genomes is easily accessible through myRT web-
server athttps://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/myRT/.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of the RT dataset
We curated a collection of 1,988 non redundant RTs based
on different sources: CRISPR-Cas associated RTs were
collected from (35), group II intron RTs were extracted
from groupii (
39), DGR RTs were previously collected as
part of our research on DGRs systems (5) (which inte-
grated DGR RTs from multiple sources (25,41–44)), nine
AbiA (abortive AbiA) representatives were downloaded
fromCDD( 45),andRTsequencesoftheremainingclasses
were extracted from dataset of RTs collected by Toroetal.
(4,35). As some of these datasets overlap, redundant RTs
were removed (using cd-hit (46) cutoff value of 1). This in-
tegrated dataset contains RTs from group II introns (GII),
CRISPR-Cas, DGRs, retrons, AbiA, AbiK, AbiP2, G2L,
etc. This classification is mostly based on the grouping of
RTs in (35), and was verified by us by analyzing the phylo-
g e n e t i ct r e eo fR V T
1 motif sequences (see Results).
Construction of class-specific HMMs of RVT1 domain for
RT prediction and classification
Since all RT sequences contain the RVT1 domain (Pfam
ID:PF00078), weusedtheRVT 1motifsequencestobuild
class specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for RTs of
different classes, which can then be used for identification
and classification of RTs in genomes and metagenomes.
For identification of RVT
1 domain in RT sequences, we
used hmmscan (hmmer-3.2) (47) search against the Pfam-
A model (PF00078) (48), and further validated the predic-
tionusingCDD-search( 45)andmanualcheck.Hitsoflow
significance or with a short length were manually checked.
We noticed that the predicted RT domains in UG2 RTs
and 15 out of UG28 RTs were split into two fragments in
PAGE 3OF 13 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.5 e29
these proteins, which resulted in poor multiple alignment
of RT sequences and phylogenetic tree with atypically long
branches. Using CDD-search fixed the problem and pro-
duced a single predicted RVT1 domain in each of these
sequences. Therefore, we used predicted RVT1 domains
based on CDD-searches for these proteins for downstream
analyses including multiple alignment and phylogenetic re-
construction.
We used Muscle (v3.8.31) (49) to align the extracted
RVT
1 domains in the RT sequences, and then used Fast-
Tree2 (50) to build a phylogenetic tree of all the RT se-
quences, using bootstrap value of 100. By examining the
phylogenetic tree, in combination with genomic context
analysis, we confirmed the grouping of the RT sequences
in the different classes, and for a small number of cases,
re-assigned their classes (see Results). We also added new
classes. In total, all RTs can be grouped into 41 classes.
Extracted RVT
1 domains for each class were aligned
separately using Muscle, and after re-formatting the align-
ments from fasta to stockholm, we used hmmbuild (51)t o
obtain hmm models for each class. Then, all of these hmm
models(fordifferentclasses)werecombinedintoonemodel
(RVT-All.hmm).
MyRT for identification and characterization of RTs in
genomes and metagenomes
We developed myRT for identification of RTs in genomes
and metagenomes. MyRT is based on similarity search
against the class-specific RT HMMs, facilitated with phy-
logenetic analysis by pplacer (52) for the cases when no
clear classes can be inferred based on similarity search.
First, FragGeneScan (version 1.31) (53) is used to quickly
predict the protein coding genes in the input genome (or
metagenome); however, if prediction of protein coding
genes (given in a gff file) is available, protein sequences will
be generated based on the input gff file instead. Next, our
pipeline uses predicted protein sequences to find all the
RVT
1 domains encoded by the input genome in two steps
(see Figure1):
(a) IdentificationofinitialputativeRTproteinsusingafo-
cusedsearchofRTdomainsinallproteins.Inthisstep,
hmmscanisusedtosearchallpredictedproteinsagainst
RVT-All.hmm we created that contains only HMMs
of class-specific RTs, with e-value of 10
−3 (-E 0.0001 –
domE 0.0001) as the threshold. Proteins that are pre-
dicted to contain RT domains are considered candi-
dates. Since RVT-All.hmm only contains RT domains,
some of the identified candidates are likely to be false
positives and need to be filtered out by the following
step.
(b) Refinement of RT protein candidates by expanded
search of domains in the RT candidates. In this step,
hmmscan is applied to search candidate RT proteins
against HMMs of a large collection of domains (cdd-
pfamA.hmm, which contains a total of 59 083 CDD
and Pfam-A domains). Candidates that don’t contain
a RT related domain (i.e. RVT
1, group II RT mat,
RT G2 intron, etc.) are considered false positives and
are excluded from further analysis. This step is crucial

be assigned to specific classes using similarity searches (hmmscan), and
a small number of RTs can be assigned to a specific class by combining
phylogenetic analysis.
for filtering the false positives (e.g. genes containing
DNA binding domains), and the combination of this
step with the previous step provides a fast prediction
with a high precision and recall.
Classification of putative RT proteins is based on the
above hmmscan search results, and in some cases an extra
stepofphylogeneticplacementoftheproteinsinthetreeof
RTs. Given a putative RT protein, we consider that its RT
classcanbeconfidentlyassigned,ifonlyoneclassofRTdo-
mainisfoundbyhmmscan,orthetophithasasignificantly
lowerE-value than the rest (i.e.E-value of the second hit is
10
5 foldshigherthanthe E-valueofthetophit).Inthecases
when a class cannot be assigned, myRT keeps the top three
hits, and relies on an extra step based on the placement of
the putative RT protein in the phylogenetic tree of known
RTs for final assignment of the class for the putative RT
protein. The phylogenetic tree of known RTs was inferred
by FastTree2 (with a bootstrap value of 100) using multi-
plealignmentofRVT

If the putative RT is placed on a leaf node, then the puta-
tive RT is assigned the class of the leaf node; otherwise if
at least 90% of the leaf nodes in the subtree rooted at the
putative RT share the same class, this class will be assigned
to the putative RT. The confidence of the prediction at this

top three hmmscan hits), this class will be selected as the

ically.
Genomic neighborhood analysis for putative RTs
To provide genomic neighborhood information of puta-
tive RTs, myRT examines up to four neighboring genes for
each putative RT (up to two genes downstream, and up
to two genes upstream of the RT, with a maximum inter-
genic region of 2 kbps). The neighboring genes together
with the putative RT proteins will be searched against cdd-
pfamA.hmm (using hmmscan and a maximumE-value of
10
−3) to annotate the proteins encoded by these genes. The
results can be used to infer domains that are frequently
fused to the RVT
1 domains of the putative RT proteins,
andthefrequentdomainsencodedbytheneighboringgenes
of the RT gene. We note when the predicted class of RT
is CRISPR, but the putative RT gene has no nearbycas
genes (e.g.cas1a n dcas2), myRT will re-assign the class as
CRISPR-like.ThewebversionofmyRTprovidesvisualiza-
tion of the prediction of putative RTs along with their ge-
nomic neighborhood.

mains found in RTs and their genomic neighborhood, and

For each RT class, we compiled a list of domains that co-
occurwiththisspecificclassofRTalongwiththefrequency
of the co-occurrence in complete and draft genomes. Some
domains are ubiquitous while others tend to be associated
with a certain type of RT. To quantify the specific associa-
tion of some domains with the different types of RT genes,
we proposed aspecificity scoreof a domain for a particu-
lar class of RT, which is the number of genomes contain-
ing this domain in the neighborhood of the particular class
of RT divided by the number of times that the domain is
found in the neighborhood of any of the RTs. The speci-
ficity score ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that a
domain is exclusively associated with a particular RT class.
Usingthesetools,wecanseethat46%oftheUG28bRTsco-
occur with VirE

ily multidrug efflux MFS transporter), among the RTs that
co-occur with this domain (including 207 Retrons-RT, 2

(i.e.PRK10473ishighlyspecifictoRetronRTwithaspeci-
ficity score of 0.99; see Supplementary Figure S2).
Genomes and metagenomes
We applied myRT to predict putative RTs in reference
genomes (including complete and incomplete) and selected
metagnenomes. Reference genomes were downloaded from
the NCBI ftp website as of 22 October 2020. For com-
plete genomes, we used NCBI’s prediction of putative cod-
ing genes, whereas for draft genomes, we used FragGeneS-
can(53)topredictproteincodinggenes.Formetagenomes,
thereadsweretrimmedusingTrimmomatic( 56),andpaired
reads were assembled using MetaSPAdes (53). FragGeneS-
canwasthenusedtopredictputativecodinggenesfromthe

RESULTS
Reclassification of some RTs, expansion of rare RT classes
and addition of new classes
We improved the collection of RT sequences and their
models from three different aspects: reclassifying some RT
sequences that were likely misclassified; adding more se-
quences for rare RT classes for model construction, and
adding new RT classes.
We first applied the class-specific HMM models to pre-
dict and assign classes to the sequences in the initial train-
ing dataset. More than 99% of predictions agreed with
the old classification. The rest could be either errors in
the old classifications or misclassifications introduced by
myRT.Weanalyzedthesecasesfurther,combiningtheirse-
quential, genomic neighborhood, and phylogenetic infor-
mation. Further we used CRISPRone (57), myDGR (5),
and groupii (39,40) to confirm RTs involved in CRISPR-
cas, DGR and group II introns, respectively. We excluded
three sequences that don’t contain RVT
1 domain, includ-
ing YP002455118.1 (WP000385107.1), KQB14190.1 and
WP 009625650.1. In addition, we were able to revise the
classification for a total of 10 RTs summarized in Table1
and Supplementary Table S1. For example, EGP13976.1 is
oneofthe155DGRRTsidentifiedby( 42),butitistheonly
one (out of 155) that is not part of a DGR system; we re-
grouped it as an intron-RT with appended GIIM domain.
We improved the hmm models for the classes with few
representatives. We applied myRT to find putative RTs in
20 036 complete and 118 883 draft prokaryotic genomes,
and extracted new RTs that belong to classes with few rep-
resentatives (including UG15 and UG21). Then, we veri-
fied the accuracy of these new classifications by adding the
RVT
1motifsequenceoftheseputativeRTstothephyloge-
netic tree of RTs (see Figure2), to make sure that they fall
in the right clade. After adding these newly classified RTs
to the training data, we rebuilt the hmm models for these
rare classes. For instance, starting from six UG25 RTs, we
wereabletoincludeanadditionalof19sequencesandused
a total of 25 sequences to build the HMM of UG25.
We added new classes of RTs based on a combination
ofsequential,phylogenetictreeandgenomicneighborhood
analyses. We divided G2L RTs into three classes (G2L,
G2Lb, G2Lc) based on their placement on the phyloge-
netic tree and how these sequences are clustered together
in a branch in the phylogenetic tree (see Figure2). Simi-
larly we divided UG28 RTs into two classes and called the
smaller class UG28b. The hmm of UG28b was built using
15 sequences that form a separate clade in the phylogenetic
tree. In addition, UG28 and UG28b RTs have different do-
mainsintheirgenomicneighborhood––45%ofUG28bRTs
co-occur with VirE
N domains. The final RVT-All.hmm
contains 45 HMM models (for 41 RT classes; some classes
havemorethanonemodel,andCRISPRandCRISPR-like
share the same HMM models) built from a total of 1988
RVT1 sequences. Number of representatives of each class,

Evaluation of myRT using three independent collections of
RTs
We applied myRT to three independent collections of RTs
for evaluation. All results showed that myRT gave accurate
classification of RTs. Supplementary Tables S2– S4 provide
access of myRT results for these three collections.
The first collection contains CRISPR-Cas reverse tran-
scriptases (branch 1 - branch 10) from (36) that were not
used in building the hmm models. The last column of Sup-
plementary Table S2 shows the identities of each RT to

jacent to acas1 gene. Our pipeline did not recognize the

three RTs in Supplementary Table S2 are associated with
typeI-ECRISPR-systems,haveanadjacent cas3gene ,and
two of them have an adjacent gene encoding AbiEii do-
main (atypical for CRISPR-Cas RTs). Although we do not
have specific models for these unusual CRISPR-Cas RTs,
LAKD01000050.1 was correctly predicted as a CRISPR
RTbymyRT.MyRTpredictedAJKO01000007.1asaUG2
RT instead of a CRISPR RT, and we believe the original
annotation in (36) was wrong: the RT gene was found in
Streptococcusoralis SK10(EIC80228.1),whichencodesfor
atypeICRISPR-Cassystem,butthe casgenesandtheRT
gene don’t co-locate; and the RT was also annotated as a
UG2 RT in a later study (35). MyRT couldn’t assign the
last two putative RTs (DS570667.1 and CP007699.1) to a
specific RT class so annotated them as unclassified (UNC)
RT. Overall, we estimate that myRT can predict a CRISPR
RT as CRISPR /CRISPR-like RT with an accuracy
of 93%.
We then tested our model on datasets from (6) (exclud-
ing unclassified RTs). To fairly assess myRT’s performance
we excluded RTs that shared more than 87% identity with
our RT collection. The majority of the retained ones share
30%-50% identity with our training set which is normal
considering that all of them have conserved RT domains.

matched with the groupings from this collection, except
two putative G2L5 (GII-like-5) RTs, ZP

seem to be located in transposons: ZP
01854760.1 shares
33% sequence identity with YP552148.1 (a GII RT), but
lacks the GIIM domain; and the other one ZP01851753.1
has HTH Tnp 1 (helix-turn-helix) and Tra5 (transposase
InsO and inactivated derivatives) encoded by its flanking
genes.
Finally, we tested our pipeline on a dataset of 16 retrons
with validated RTs (16), 12 of which were recently exper-
imentally proved to function as anti-phage defense sys-
tems. Five of these RTs were already in our training set,
yet the other 11 shared less than 61% sequence identity
with the RTs included in our training data. MyRT wasable
to correctly predict all of them as retron RTs, providing
an accuracy of 100% (see Table2 and Supplementary Ta-
ble S4). One example is the Ec48 retron system, which has
proved vigorous defense againstSiphoviridae, Myoviridae
andPodoviridaephages.Wenoteinthegenomicneighbhor-
hood of the Ec49 retron system, there are genes encoding
for an AbiP2 RT (sharing 99% identity with CAJ43157.1,
AbiP2RTof EnterobacteriaphageP2-EC58),andotherdo-
mains include Q (portal vertex) and phage
GPA (bacterio-
phage replication gene A protein).
Putative RTs identified in bacterial genomes
We applied myRT to predict putative reverse transcriptase,
alongside their class in all complete and draft bacterial
genomes. In total, 8,244 out of 20,036 complete genomes,
and 118,841 out of 262,497 draft genomes each contain
at least one putative RT. This collection is easily accessi-
ble through our web-server. We note that for genomes with
predicted RTs associated with DGRs or CRISPRs, DGR
prediction (by myDGR) and CRISPR-Cas prediction (by
CRISPRone) are also provided. Figure4 shows the dis-
tribution of each RT class in complete and draft bacte-
rial genomes. Just as expected, group II intron is the most
prevalent class of RT (≈65%), followed by retron (≈12%).
Retronswererecentlyfoundtoprovidephagedefensemech-
anisms, and myRT predicted a total of 2973 and 30 825
retron RTs in the complete and draft genomes, respectively
(see Supplementary Table S5). These putative retron RTs

tionoftheretronRTsinbacterialgenomes.Belowweshow

mids are available in Supplementary Table S6.

Figure 5 shows myRT predictions of two genomes. The
first example isNostocsp. PCC 7120 and its plasmids. The
two plasmids each contain a gene encoding group-II in-
tronRT,andthegenomeencodesfourclassesofRT:DGR,
CRISPR, retron and group II intron as shown in Figure5
(left, only showing predicted RTs in the genome; see pre-
dicted RTs in the genome and the plasmids at myRT web-
site). The second example isMicrocystisaeruginosa NIES-
843,whichhassevenRTsallrelatedtogroupIIintrons.Six
ofthesevenRTsarealmostidentical(sharing97–99%iden-
tity), and they only share low identity (51%) with the sev-
enth RT (which shares 65% identity with ACV02121.1, a
group II intron RT inCyanothecesp. PCC 8802). As seen
in Figure5 (right), six of these group II intron RTs have a
fused McrA domain (5-methylcytosine-specific restriction
endonuclease McrA).
Surprisingly, we observed that Bacillus thuringiensis
YBT-1518 and its plasmids have a large number of group
II intron RTs (74 GII RTs), and one RT with unknown
function, which is similar to class of UG4 RTs, but doesn’t
have Fimbrial domain in its genomic neighborhood. Out
of these 74 RTs, 60 of them are identical to AHA69388.1
(RT #1) and 3 of them are identical to AHA69975.1
(RT #6). AHA69975.1 is adjacent to a potential virulence
gene with VirD4 (Type IV secretory pathway component)
domain.
Application of myRT to the complete bacterial genomes
resulted in the identification of 29 AbiA RTs. More than
70% of these AbiA RTs have a fused HEPN
AbiA CTD
domain. Examples of AbiA and AbiK, can be found in
U17233.3 (Lactococcus lactisplasmid pTR2030), and in
U35629.2 (Lactococcus lactisplasmid pSRQ800), respec-
tively. Based on the genomic neighborhood, this AbiK
seems to be part of a restriction-modification system. The
third class of Abi RTs is AbiP2, an example of AbiP2 is
found in E. coli536. Some AbiP2 RTs are located in a
CRISPR-Cas loci, and may be associated with CRISPR-
Cassystemsasdiscussedearlier.OtherexamplesofAbiRTs
can be accessed through myRT-collection.
When applied myRT to predict putative RTs in com-
plete genomes, about 93% of the putative RT had their
class assigned solely based on hmmscan results. For the
rest, phylogenetic information was used to assign a class
to 85% of them. Among 25,570 predicted RTs in complete

which share more than 56% identity with YP003455357.1
(CBJ12261.1) unclassified RT in Legionella longbeachae
NSW150. Table3 and Supplementary Table S7 contains
some of the examples where phylogenetic information
helped improve the classification of putative RTs. For in-
stance ADE85032.1 was predicted as a CRISPR RT. Had
we only used hmm models, it would be predicted as GII
RT. This RT has a fused Cas1 domain, and its encod-
ing gene has a cas6 gene in the genomic neighborhood
which indicates this RT is indeed related to a CRISPR-
Cassystem.Theothersetofexamplesinclude10UG3RTs
that otherwise would be classified as Unclassified RTs (e.g.
UG3/DGRs/UG17), and we note that nine of these pre-
dicted UG3 have UG8 in their neighborhood (UG3 and
UG8 tend to co-occur according to our training data and
previous studies (6,59)).
Application of myRT to predict RTs in metagenomes
For demonstration purposes, we applied our pipeline to
identifyputativeRTsinmetagenomes.Thefirstsetcontains
four gut metagenomes (ERR248260-ERR248263) from fe-
cal microbiota of human, chicken, cow, and pig from
(60). As seen in Figure 6, all gut metagenomes contain
higher proportions of DGR-related RTs as compared to
the reference bacterial genomes (see Figure4), and the pig
gut metagenome has the highest proportion of DGR RTs
among all. The pig gut metagenome contains 1350 puta-
tive RTs, including 659 GII RTs, 380 DGR RTs (348 af-
ter removing sequence redundancy by cd-hit (46) using se-
quence identify cutoff of 70%), 119 retron RTs and other
classesofRTs.Outof348non-redundantDGRRTsinthis
dataset,157sharelessthan70%identitywiththeDGR-RTs
from complete and draft bacterial genomes which contains
4465 non-redundant DGR-RTs (cut-off value: 0.7). Using
myDGR, we were able to identify 38, 15, 15 and 15 com-
plete DGRs (a typical DGR system contains a RT gene,
a template region TR, and a target gene containing the
corresponding variable region VR) in the human, chicken,
cow and pig gut metagenome, respectively, reflecting the
fragmented nature of the metagenome assemblies (many
of the contigs are very short). Supplementary Table S8 in-
cludes the links to myRT and myDGR predictions of these
metagenomes.
To further investigate if pig gut metagenomes generally
have a high proportion of DGR-RTs, we tested four addi-
tional pig gut metagenomes (ERR1135178–ERR1135181)
from (61). According to myRT results, even higher propor-
tions of DGR-RTs (42–49%) were observed in these pig
gutmetagenomes(seeSupplementaryTableS8andSupple-
mentary Figure S3).
Genomic context preferences of different classes of RTs
With predictions of putative RTs in complete genomes, we
were able to identify domains that are frequently found in
the proteins encoded by the neighboring genes of putative
RTs (including those that are fused with the RT genes).

A recent work studied the domains associated with
Retron RTs, and ATPase (COG3950) was one of the do-
mains found in the genomic neighborhood of Retron RT
genes (clade 1 in (63)). Our analysis also revealed this as-
sociation with a specificity score of 0.96 and 1 in com-
plete and draft genomes, respectively. The high specificity
score for this domain from our analysis provides a quan-
titative metric showing the specific association of this do-
mainwithRetronRTs(butrarelywithRTsofotherclasses).
Our results also showed several other domains that are
(almost) exclusively associated with Retron RTs, includ-
ing PRK10473 (MdtL family multidrug efflux MFS trans-
porter) and PRK08617 (acetolactate synthase, AlsS); by
contrast, smart00530 is frequently found in the Retron RT
geneneighborhood, however,itisalso frequentlyfoundto-
gether with group II RT (GII) and other types (see Fig-
ure 7A and B for a comparison). PRK08617 was found in
the neighborhood of Retron RT genes in manyS. aureus
genomes (including 110 complete and 3319 draft genomes;
see Figure7C for an example, and more details at myRT
website), and is also associated with GII RT but only in
four genomes, including oneS. aureusgenome (see Figure
7D), Bacillusthuringiensis YBT-1518, and two genomes of
L.reuteri. S.aureus AlsS was reported to confer resistance
to nitrosative stress and contribute to the successful infec-
tion of murine macrophages, and resistance ofS.aureus to
beta-lactam antibiotics (64). Our genomic context analy-
sis revealed a strong association of AlsS (and AlsD) with
Retron RTs, especially inS. aureus, suggesting a possible
connectionofRetronRTswiththesebiologicalprocessesin
S.aureus.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we provided a tool for prediction, and classi-
fication of reverse transcriptase (RT) in bacterial genomes.
Reverse transcriptases, the enzymes that convert RNA into
cDNA, play substantial roles in different systems such as
Diversity Generating Retroelements (DGRs), group II in-
trons, CRISPR-Cas systems, retrons, etc. Identification of
these RTs can provide us with information about the un-
derlying interactions between phage and bacteria, archaea
and archaeal viruses, and so forth. It can also help us to
determine the origin of the RT, does it come from another
species, or is it native (for instance, DGR RTs that come
from phage)? Classification of RTs can also be extremely
helpful when it comes to biotechnological/medical appli-
cations of certain classes of RTs, such as utilizing group II
introns RTs as targetron and thermotargetron, and make
use of retrons RTs in CRISPEY, SCRIBE and HiSCRIBE
methods, or as anti-phage defense systems. As RTs from
each class have similar functions, characterization of every
single RT is of importance, as it can shed light into iden-
tification of other RTs from the same class/family. Experi-
mentalstudiescancometorescue,andidentifythefunction

tional and experimental fields.
We showed that myRT provides accurate predictions for
most RT classes, esp. the large classes such as GII, retron
and DGR RTs. However, we acknowledge that smaller or
unknown classes of RTs will be more challenging to pre-

dict, because either the HMM models used for prediction
and classification were built from a smaller number of se-
quences, or because some classes are very similar to each
other and are close in the phylogenetic tree of RTs. Never-
theless,myRTwouldbeabletopredictthoseRTs,whichcan
be further analyzed by using other information.
We expect that genomic neighborhood information can
helpprovideinsightsintotheputativefunctionofunknown
classes of RTs, including UG1-UG28, and other classes of
RTs. Fused domains in these RTs, alongside the informa-
tionaboutthedomainsintheflankinggenesofRTsineach
class,canprovideuswithsomeinsightsintothefunctionsof
these RTs. Also, as we collect more data for each class, this
information can be used or examined by researchers. For
example, SLATT
5 is frequently seen next to UG17 RTs.
Our analyses show that 81% of RTs in complete genomes
that have UG17 RT, also have SLATT5 in the genomic
neighborhood of the UG17 RT. Similarly, 76% of UG17
RTs in draft genomes have a SLATT
5 domain in their
flanking genes. An example of SLATT domain next to a
reverse transcriptase inSalmonellaenterica subsp. enterica
serovar9,12:l,v:-str.94293ismentionedin( 62).Thisreverse
transcriptase shares 92% identity with WP015462025.1,
UG17 RTs fromEdwardsiella piscicidaC07-087, which is
mistakenly labeled as CRISPR RT in several other articles,
yet our phylogenetic analysis showed that this RT groups
with UG17 RTs, it has the SLATT5 domain in its adja-
cent neighboring gene, and importantly we couldn’t detect
any Cas neighbors, or CRISPR systems in this reference
genome.
