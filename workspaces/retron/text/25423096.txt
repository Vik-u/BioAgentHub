Abstract
Much less is known about reverse transcriptases (RTs) in prokaryotes than in
eukaryotes, with most prokaryotic enzymes still uncharacterized. Two surveys
involving BLAST searches for RT genes in prokaryotic genomes revealed the
presence of large numbers of diverse, uncharacterized RTs and RT-like sequences.
Here, using consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from
GenBank and other sources via RAST, available from the PATRIC (Pathogenic
Resource Integration Center) platform, we have compiled the data for currently
annotated reverse transcriptases from completely sequenced bacterial genomes.
RT sequences are broadly distributed across bacterial phyla, but green sulfur
bacteria and cyanobacteria have the highest levels of RT sequence diversity
(#85% identity) per genome. By contrast, phylum Actinobacteria, for which a large
number of genomes have been sequenced, was found to have a low RT sequence
diversity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that bacterial RTs could be classified into
17 main groups: group II introns, retrons/retron-like RTs, diversity-generating
retroelements (DGRs), Abi-like RTs, CRISPR-Cas-associated RTs, group II-like
RTs (G2L), and 11 other groups of RTs of unknown function. Proteobacteria had the
highest potential functional diversity, as they possessed most of the RT groups.
Group II introns and DGRs were the most widely distributed RTs in bacterial phyla.
Our results provide insights into bacterial RT phylogeny and the basis for an update
of annotation systems based on sequence/domain homology.
Introduction

by the reverse transcription of an RNA transposition intermediate and the
insertion of the resulting cDNA at a new site. The enzyme that converts the RNA

into cDNA, reverse transcriptase (RT), was discovered in 1970 [1–2] in RNA
tumor viruses (retroviruses). All retrotransposons have RTs, and these enzymes
are classified into two main classes on the basis of their mechanism of
transposition and DNA organization: 1) LTR-retrotransposons, which are
characterized by direct repeats of a few hundred base pairs at their ends (long
terminal repeats), generally containing thegag and pol genes; the Pol enzyme
encoded by these sequences has several enzymatic domains (RT, RNase H,
integrase, and PR or proteinase); and 2) non-LTR retrotransposons, which have
no terminal repeats and are highly abundant in eukaryotes (known as LINEs in
mammals). They contain a single ORF encoding a protein with RT and EN
(endonuclease) domains or two ORFs, the first displaying similarity to thegag
gene of retroviruses, and the second encoding the RT and EN domains. LTR
retrotransposons are thought to have evolved from non-LTR retrotransposons
through the acquisition of an integrase, and retroviruses are thought to have
evolved from LTR retrotransposons through the incorporation of envelope (env
domain) genes from other viruses [
3,4]. Retrotransposons have greatly influenced
eukaryotic genomes, accounting for about 45% of the human genome and driving
genome evolution and changes in gene expression [
5].
Bacterial RTs were discovered much later, in a retroelement known as a retron
[6–7], which synthesizes a large number of multicopy single-stranded DNA
(msDNA) molecules. Retrons are thought to have no independent mobility, and
their function remains unknown. Another type of bacterial retroelement, the DGR
(diversity-generating retroelement), was first described in 2002 [
8]. DGRs consist
of an RT, an accessory protein (encoded by theatd gene), an RNA template, and a
gene encoding the target protein (mtd), which contains a C-terminal variable
region (VR). DGRs do not appear to be mobile, but they produce diverse
sequences in the VR region, potentially conferring resistance against phages [
9–
10]. Bacteria have other mechanisms of antiphage immunity, including CRISPR
(clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) and Abi (abortive
bacteriophage infection) systems. CRISPR and theircas-associated genes encode a
sequence-specific mechanism of defense against bacteriophages and plasmids [
11–
13], consisting of an array of short repetitive sequences (,40 bp long) separated
by equally short spacer sequences. Two uncharacterized classes of bacterial RTs
have been shown to be associated with CRISPR/cas elements, and some RTs are
fused to cas genes [
14–15], but their role in CRISPR function is unknown. The
Abi system blocks phages at different stages in the infection cycle and is generally
mediated by a single plasmid-encoded gene. The AbiA, AbiK, and Abi-P2 systems
are known to include a RT [
16–18]. Mutations of the gene encoding the RT of
AbiK have been shown to block infection [16], and this enzyme has recently been
shown to have genuine RT activity [19].
The best characterized mobile bacterial retroelements are the catalytic RNAs
known as group II introns. These mobile elements were first identified in the
mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes and plants, and have
subsequently been described in bacteria and archaea [
20–24]. Group II introns
consist of a structured RNA that folds into a conserved three-dimensional

structure organized into six double-helical domains, DI to DVI [25]. Most
bacterial group II introns have an open reading frame (ORF) encoding an intron-
encoded protein (IEP) in DIV. This IEP consists of an RT followed by a putative
RNA-binding domain with RNA splicing or maturase activity (the X domain),
and, in some intron lineages, a C-terminal DNA-binding and endonuclease
domain [
26–28]. It is thought that both nuclear spliceosomal introns and non-
LTR retrotransposons evolved from mobile group II introns [26–32], which may
also influence bacterial evolution [33].
Much less is known about the RTs of prokaryotes than about those of
eukaryotes, and many of these enzymes remain uncharacterized. Two surveys [14–
15] investigating the presence of RT sequences in prokaryotic genomes revealed
large numbers of diverse, uncharacterized RTs and RT-like sequences, which were
grouped into 20 phylogenetic classes with 11 domain architectures [
15]. Here, we
used consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from GenBank
and other sources, via RAST [34,35], available from the PATRIC (Pathogenic
Resource Integration Center) platform [36], to compile data for the currently
annotated reverse transcriptases from completely sequenced bacterial genomes.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that bacterial RTs could be classified into 17 main
groups. We provide strong evidence for the definition of several classes of RT that
could provide the basis for a more comprehensive annotation of RT sequences in
databases.
Materials and Methods
Collation of the RT dataset
For phylogenetic analyses, we used an RT (RT 0–7 domains) dataset described in a
previous study [28] and including representatives of group II (GII) intron ORFs
of subclasses A, C, D, E (E1/E2), F and the new varietyg1, with no recognizable D/
En region (En2), together with representatives of subclasses B, CL (CL1A, CL1B,
CL2A, and CL2B), and ML, with a recognizable D/En region (En+). The GII RT
dataset included 153 unique sequences that were#85% identical, with the
exception of the subclass A RT sequences E.c.I4 and S.f.I1, because the bacterial
group II intron database (
http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/,groupii/index.html?)
contains only three reported members of this subclass, which are almost identical
(99% identity). Other uncharacterized bacterial RT sequences [
15] corresponding
to the group II intron-like groups G2L1-5 and G2L-other (24), retrons/retron-like
RTs (113), DGRs (36), the abortive phage infection AbiK (3) and Abi-P2 (8)
groups, and other unknown RT groups (UG) 1–9 and unclassified (UN) elements
(118) were then added to the group II intron RTs. Multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) including only sequences displaying#85% identity were generated for
this dataset and subjected to various phylogenetic analyses, to determine the
consistency of the monophyly previously proposed for the different groups [
15],
and to select reliable representative members. AbiA sequences and sequences for
the group II intron-like G2L5 group were not included in the final dataset,
Bacterial Reverse Transcriptases
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 3/1 6
because the AbiA sequences displayed poor conservation of the RT domain and
the G2L5 sequences did not form a consistent supported group in our analyses.
The final dataset (Table S1) contained 277 sequences, 124 of which were assigned
to RT groups other than group II intron ORFs.
Search for annotated bacterial RTs
We used the PATRIC platform to search for annotated bacterial RTs. This
platform offers consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from
GenBank and other sources via RAST, the most widely used and highly cited
automated microbial annotation system [
34–36]. For practical purposes, the
search was carried out independently for the various phyla and classes for which
complete genome sequences were available. At the time of analysis (06/23/2014),
the database contained 239 complete genomes for Alphaproteobacteria, 144 for
Betaproteobacteria, 570 for Gammaproteobacteria and 156 for Delta/Epsilon
Proteobacteria. It also contained 556 complete genomes from phylum Firmicutes,
including 418 from bacilli and 138 from clostridia. Complete genome sequences
were available for 339 actinobacteria, 98 members of the Bacteroidetes/green
sulfur bacteria (phylum Chlorobi) group and 72 cyanobacteria. We searched the
PATRIC database with the Feature Finder tool, searching for reverse transcriptase
coding sequences (CDS). The product sequence did not refer exclusively to reverse
transcriptases, but included heterogeneous annotations, such as retron-type RNA-
directed DNA polymerase, retron-type reverse transcriptase, mobile element
protein, hypothetical protein, conserved domain protein, RNA-directed DNA
polymerase, probable group II intron maturase/reverse transcriptase, and
ribonuclease III. Nevertheless, the keyword ‘‘reverse transcriptase’’ was present in
the corresponding annotation in the PATRIC, BRC or Refseq database and a
conserved RT domain was identified in all cases. Sequences were downloaded and
analyzed with Geneious Pro software (Biomatters Ltd.), and proteins of less than
200 amino acids in length were discarded as probable fragments. We then used
MAFFT and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix to align sequences for each phylum.
The % identity obtained with the distance matrix for the alignment was used to
identify protein sequences displaying#85% identity overall. For further analyses,
we retained 662 sequences: 293 sequences from Proteobacteria, 182 from
Firmicutes, 22 from Actinobacteria, 60 from Bacteroidetes/green sulfur bacteria
and 105 from Cyanobacteria. We used MAFFT to align these sequences with the
277 RT sequences of the initial dataset, and the amino-acid region corresponding
to RT domains 0 to 7 was then extracted. The annotated RTs from PATRIC
displaying #85% identity (sequences displaying.85% identity were not found
across phyla) and different from the initial dataset (465 sequences) were retained:
209 from Proteobacteria, 128 from Firmicutes, 13 from Actinobacteria, 42 from
Bacteroidetes/green sulfur bacteria and 73 from Cyanobacteria. We used MAFFT
to generate a final alignment with 742 sequences (Figure S1), and 100 bootstrap
repetitions were carried out with GUIDANCE (
http://guidance.tau.ac.il)[ 37]t o
Bacterial Reverse Transcriptases

obtain alignment confidence scores for each pair of residues. The final alignment
used for the phylogenetic analyses contained 254 informative positions.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analysis was performed with several different maximum likelihood
estimation methods implemented in Geneious Pro (Biomatters Ltd.) and Cipres
Science Gateway platform [
38]. We generated unrooted trees with FastTree [39–
40], using pseudocounts (recommended for sequences containing large numbers
of gaps), a discrete gamma model with 20 rate categories (‘‘Gamma20’’) for
between-site rate variation, and the WAG model of amino-acid evolution. Local
support values for branches were obtained by applying the Shimodaira-Hasegawa
test to three alternative topologies (NNIs) around the split. It has been suggested
that, for very large phylogenies, FastTree is less sensitive to alignment and dataset
size than other maximum likelihood methods that estimate phylogeny very
quickly with little or no loss of tree accuracy [40]. The other methods used
included RAxML [41], with the LG amino-acid substitution model and a discrete
gamma model with four categories and 400 bootstraps.
Results and Discussion
Insights from bacterial RT phylogeny
Annotated RTs were retrieved from the PATRIC database, as indicated in the
Materials and Methods. Searches were performed for most bacterial phyla, but
only RT sequences from phyla for which larger complete sequenced genomes were
available (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, the Bacteroidetes/green
sulfur bacteria group and Cyanobacteria) and with large numbers of annotated
RTs were included in the phylogenetic analyses. We generated a final dataset
containing 742 RT sequences, and a MSA was constructed by GUIDANCE (Figure
S1), for the generation of unrooted phylogenetic trees with FastTree (
Figure 1A)
and RAxML (Figure 1B).
Group II intron ORFs
The FastTree phylogeny (Figure 1A) strongly supported all previously described
GII ORF classes, A, B, C, D, E, CL, ML, and the new varietiesg1 to g4 with a local
value of 0.96 to 1. The RAxML phylogeny (Figure 1B) also supported the ORF
classes and varieties (bootstrap values of 71% to 100%), but provided low levels of
statistical support for class ML and subgroup CL1B. The RAxML method may be
more sensitive to the alignment and dataset size, due to the small number of
characters (254 aa) in the alignment. Surprisingly, FastTree provided strong
support (local value 0.99) for class F, for which weak statistical support was
provided by the tree generated by RAxML (Figure 1B), and by other previous
maximum likelihood estimations [28,42]. Class F corresponds to the previously
described varietiesg2–g4 [28], including c-Ku.st.I1, and the So.us.I2, Ge.ur.I1 and

Pe.th.I2 RT sequences that cluster together in the inferred trees (this cluster is
referred to below as varietyg5), for which there was a high degree of support
(local value of 0.96 and bootstrap value of 90%). Classes D and E appear to be
sister clades in both trees (local value of 0.96 and bootstrap value of 80%),
consistent with the findings of a previous study [
28]. Some RTs from class C
introns (D.pI1, Pe.th.I1 and Al.or.I2) were previously shown to form a divergent
subgroup [28]. In the phylogenetic trees generated by FastTree and RAxML, these
RT sequences, together with sequences from other clostridia and gammaproteo-
bacteria, including sequences from the current group II intron database (Na.th.I1,
Tc.po.I1 and Al.ma.I1), clustered together (local value of 1 and bootstrap value of
92%) outside monophyletic class C, consistent with the monophyly of this
subgroup (referred to hereafter asg6). The class C andg6 introns have similar
intron RNA structures [
43], due to either convergent evolution under selective
pressure or the reshuffling of intron RNAs and IEPs.
We previously suggested [28] that intron ORF En+ classes (B, ML, and CL)
correspond to a monophyletic intron lineage. However, the FastTree and RAxML
phylogenies showed that classes B and ML were separated from the CL class by
several ORF En
2 classes. Furthermore, in the FastTree phylogeny, classes CL, F,
and variety g1 branched from a strongly supported node (local value 0.99).
However, neither FastTree with a shorter alignment (less aligned residues, not
shown) nor RAxML yielded this tree topology. In the inferred tree with RAxML,
class F was found outside of the ORF En
+ nodes, and the inner common node for
classes CL, A and theg1 variety lacked statistical support. The inner nodes of the
trees remain to be resolved, so relationships between En+ and En2 classes are less
reliable with the large dataset including RTs other than group II intron ORFs.
RTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systems
RTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systems without recognizable intron RNA
structures are located at the base of the group II intron lineage, together with the
g6 intron variant and other unclassified group II intron RTs. The current
classification [
44] includes three major types of CRISPR–Cas system (I, II and III),
with a further division into several subtypes and some chimeric variants. None of
the CRISPR-Cas systems with associated RTs belong to the type II lineage; some
are classified as type III-A, but most are currently unclassified systems (type III
subtype U), probably corresponding to CRISPR-Cas chimera. Some of these
CRISPR-Cas-associated RTs, which have no maturase domain, form mono-
phyletic groups with strong support (local support value of 1 and bootstrap value
§98%). These groups include the G2L2 group (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-
RT1), all four members of which are from green sulfur bacteria, and the CRISPR-
RT2 group, which includes three RTs from cyanobacteria. The previously
proposed G2L1 group [
15], which is also associated with CRISPR-Cas elements,
could be split into three distinct groups. Two groups potentially resulting from
convergent evolution were characterized on the basis of their RTs being fused to
Cas1-ORF proteins. One of these groups (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT6,
with a local support value of 1 and a bootstrap value of 100%) comprised the

green sulfur bacterial RTs fromChlorobium phaeobacteroides DSM 266
(gi|119357846) and Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme BU-1 (gi|68548733), and the
second (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT5) corresponded to a single RT from
the gammaproteobacterium Vibrio vulnificus YJ016 (gi|37677204). A third group
was characterized by RTs consisting exclusively of the RT domain. This group
included the RTs fromCandidatus kuenenia (gi|91201518) and a RT from
Delsufobacca acetooxidans (gi|328952997) (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT7,
local support value of 0.98 and bootstrap value of 94%). Similarly, the
phylogenetic tree revealed the existence of other RTs also associated with CRISPR-
Cas systems, corresponding to a RT fromThioflavococcus mobilis (gi|431828084)
and a RT fromRhodomicrobium vannielii (gi|312114615), hereafter referred to as
CRISPR-RT3 and CRISPR-RT4, respectively. All the RTs associated with CRISPR-
Cas systems were organized into seven conserved domains and the characteristic
aspartate (DD) residues of the YADD motif located in the active site of the protein
in domain 5 were 100% conserved. The tyrosine (Y) residue was replaced with a
phenylalanine (F) residue in 66% of the sequences, whereas the alanine (A)
residue in the second position was conserved in 66% of cases. These RTs may,
therefore, have polymerase activity.
Group II-like intron ORFs with conserved maturase domains
Simon and Zimmerly [15] defined five group II-like groups (G2L1–5) and a
group with a single sequence (G2L-other) as paraphyletic characterized by an
apparent lack of intron RNA structure and a conserved maturase domain in the
groups G2L3–5 and G2L-other. The G2L5 sequences (gi|149173121 and
gi|149176144 from Planctomyces maris and gi|87308561 fromBlastopirullela
marina) did not form a consistent supported group in our preliminary
phylogenetic analyses and they were not included in the initial dataset of 277
sequences. Nevertheless, the inclusion of these sequences in the final alignment
and FastTree analysis revealed that the sequences fromPlanctomyces grouped
together, but their relationships with the other RT sequences and defined RT
groups remain uncertain, since the nodes lack statistical support and closed
relatives to these sequences were not identified in our analysis (not shown). In our
phylogenetic analyses with FastTree, G2L4 (2 sequences in the initial dataset), and
a RT fromMethylocella silvestris BL2 (gi| 217978298) formed a monophyletic
group (local value of 1) that appeared to be interleaved with the CRISPR-
associated RTs (
Figure 1A), including the G2L2 (CRISPR-RT1) and G2L1
(CRISPR-RT5–7) groups. However, in the tree generated by RAxML (Figure 2B),
G2L4 (bootstrap value of 100%) appeared at the base of a potential Abi lineage.
G2L4 had a large number of substitutions per site (FastTree: 3.004 and RAxML:
2.3), suggesting that this group is evolving rapidly. It is therefore possible that the
position of G2L4 in the phylogenetic analyses may be influenced by systematic
errors caused by the mutational saturation of the G2L4 sequences. The three
members of G2L4 contain the YIDD sequence rather than the canonical YADD
motif in domain 5, and this is a distinctive unique feature of this group of RTs.

The single G2L-other sequence and the monophyletic G2L3 group (local value
0.96) were clearly separated from the other G2L groups by FastTree and RAxML
methods. The G2L3 group is one of the larger RT groups, with 16 members from
our dataset, and, in all these sequences, the alanine residue of the YADD motif is
replaced with a valine (V) residue. Thus, despite their conserved maturase
domain, G2L3 and G2L-other RTs may have an origin different from that of other
G2L groups. We therefore suggest that these two groups of RTs should be
renamed, with the nomenclature used for RTs of unknown function, hereafter
referred to as UG10 (G2L-3) and UG11 (G2L-other), and that the G2L
nomenclature should be retained only for the G2L4 group.
Retrons/retron-like RTs
A retron lineage is strongly supporte d in the phylogenies obtained with
FastTree (local support value of 1) and RAxML (bootstrap value of 94%). In
our analysis, this group expanded from six sequences in the initial dataset to
102 sequences with #85% identity. This constitutes a very large increase. The
retron-specific conserved motif (VTG) within RT domain 7 in the ‘‘Y’’ region
crucial for specific recognition and binding to the template-primer RNA used
for the synthesis of msDNA [45] was present in 47% of the sequences, with
variants including sequences with isoleucine/leucine (I/L) residue (26% of the
sequences) in the first position. Moreover, the conserved NAXXH amino-acid
motif in region ‘‘X’’, located between domains 2 and 3, could be identified in
59% of the sequences. The histidine (H)residue displayed 100% conservation
in these sequences, whereas the alanine (A) and asparagine (N) residues were
conserved in 87% and 62% of cases, respectively. We did not attempt to
identify potential msRNA/msDNA seco ndary structures, but our results
suggest that the members of this cluster are actual retron RT sequences.
The Abi lineage
T h ep h y l o g e n e t i ca n a l y s is carried out with FastTree provided strong local
support (0.98) for an Abi-related lineage of RTs, including the strongly
supported groups (local values of 0.95 to 1) Abi K; Abi-P2; UN1-5 and UG1,
7–9. RAxML also supported a potential Abi-like lineage, but including only
AbiK, Abi-P2, and the UN3–5 and UG8 groups. The relationships between
these RT groups and the UN1–2, UG1, UG7 and UG9 groups therefore remain
unclear. An analysis of the corresponding sequences of the Abi lineage
(RAxML) showed them to have a mean length of 562 aa, with a C-terminal
region of unknown domain architecture. These RTs lack the RT 0, 2a and 7
domains and the potentially active s i t ei nd o m a i n5h a sac o n s e r v e dY ( R /
V)DD sequence. It would therefore be ofinterest to determine whether these
proteins share biochemical properties, and whether they are all engaged in the
abortive infection pathway.

DGR RTs
In our analyses, a potential DGR clade containing 62 members was supported by
the FastTree phylogeny (local support value of 0.94). The mean length of 375 aa
for these sequences is consistent with the 378 aa reported as the mean length of
DGR RTs [46]. It has been suggested that DGR RTs, although highly divergent,
form a phylogenetic clade that is characterized by a (I/V/L)GxxxSQ motif in RT
domain 4 [46], which is sufficient to predict DGR association. We found that 57
of the analyzed sequences contained the SQ motif in domain 4 and a Y(V/M)DD
sequence in the active site of domain 5, which is also a feature of DGR RT
sequences. The SQ residues varied in only five sequences, in which they were
replaced by AQ or AN dipetides, or lost altogether, these variants probably
corresponding to inactivation events or sequencing errors. The RAxML phylogeny
did not provide strong support for this clade (instead it strongly supported 10
outer nodes within the clade grouping 46 sequences), but the FastTree phylogeny
and the presence of the SQ motif suggest that the grouped sequences are DGR/
DGR-like RTs.
Phylogenetic distribution of RT groups
About 57% of the bacterial RTs in the dataset corresponded to group II intron-
encoded ORFs. The next most frequent groups were retrons (13.7%), DGRs
(8.4%) and RTs of the Abi lineage (5.1%). However, the functions of bacterial RT
sequences appear to be highly diverse, as many others could be classified into
different minority groups of unknown function (Figure 2A). RT sequences were
found to be broadly distributed across bacterial phyla, the number of RT
sequences being generally correlated with the number of genomes sequenced, but,
as shown inFigure 2B, the normalized sequence diversity (ratio of RTs#85%
identity per genome) was higher for green sulfur bacteria (1.36) and
Cyanobacteria (1.28), the values obtained for Proteobacteria and Firmicutes being
much lower, at only 0.31 and 0.33, respectively. By contrast, phylum
Actinobacteria, for which a large number of genomes have been sequenced (339),
had a low diversity of RT sequences (0.07) (Figure 2B). If we consider the
distribution per RT class or per phylum (Figure 3A and 3B), Proteobacteria
display the greatest functional diversity, containing most groups, with the
exception of UN2, which appears to be restricted to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.
Moreover, five groups (G2L4, UG4, UG1, UN1 and UG9) are restricted to
Proteobacteria. Group II introns and DGRs appear to be the RTs most widely
distributed in bacterial phyla, followed by retrons, Abi, UG2 and CRISPR-Cas
RTs. These RT groups appear to be the most relevant in bacteria, but minority
groups may correspond to evolving RTs with novel properties and functions.

Conclusions
We provide here an overview of current knowledge about bacterial group II intron RTs
and the groups previously proposed on the basis of RT annotation with the PATRIC
platform, which provides consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species
from GenBank and other sources, via RAST. The application of the widely recognized
RAST procedure to all available genomesmade it possible to detect RT sequences in an
unbiased manner, based on the most up-to-date data, rather than making use of
potentially incomplete Blast searches, or missing or incorrect annotations. Several
different ML estimation methods were used for the phylogenetic analyses and FastTree
was found to estimate phylogeny with little or no loss of accuracy for the clustering of
major RT groups, with lower sensitivity to dataset size than the RAxML method.
However, the relationships between major classes remain unresolved and incon-
sistencies were observed between the results obtained with the FastTree and RAxML
methods. We found that bacterial RTs could be classified into 17 main groups: group II
introns, retrons/retron-like RTs, diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), Abi-like
RTs, CRISPR-Cas associated RTs, group II-like RTs (G2L), and 11 other groups of RTs
of unknown function. We found that RT sequence diversity was greatest in green sulfur
bacteria and cyanobacteria, but that proteobacteria displayed potentially greater
functional diversity, with some groups restricted to this phylum. Group II introns and

basis for future studies of RT properties andfunction, together with new insight into
bacterial RT phylogeny, which may facilitate an updating of annotation systems based
on sequence/domain homology.
