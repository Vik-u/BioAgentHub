Simon and Steven Zimmerly*\nDepartment of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4\nReceived July 5, 2008; Revised October 16, 2008; Accepted October 17, 2008\nABSTRACT\nRetroelements are usually considered to be eukary-\notic elements because of the large number and vari-\nety in eukaryotic genomes. By comparison, reverse\ntranscriptases (RTs) are rare in bacteria, with only\nthree characterized classes: retrons, group II introns\nand diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs).\nHere, we present the results of a bioinformatic\nsurvey that aims to define the landscape of RTs\nacross eubacterial, archaeal and phage genomes.\nWe identify and categorize 1021 RTs, of which the\nmajority are group II introns (73%). Surprisingly, a\nplethora of novel RTs are found that do not belong\nto characterized classes. The RTs have 11 domain\narchitectures and are classified into 20 groupings\nbased on sequence similarity, phylogenetic ana-\nlyses and open reading frame domain structures.\nInterestingly, group II introns are the only bacterial\nRTs to exhibit clear evidence for independent mobi-\nlity, while five other groups have putative functions\nin defense against phage infection or promotion of\nphage infection. These examples suggest that addi-\ntional beneficial functions will be discovered among\nuncharacterized RTs. The study lays the ground-\nwork for experimental characterization of these\nhighly diverse sequences and has implications for\nthe evolution of retroelements.\nINTRODUCTION\nReverse transcriptase (RT) was discovered in 1970 in\ntwo tumor-associated retroviruses, and subsequently in a\nvariety of eukaryotic elements including long terminal\nrepeat (LTR) and non-LTR retroelements, hepadnaviruses\nand telomerase (1–4). (In this article, we deﬁne a retroele-\nment as any element containing a putative RT, regardless\nof its ability to retrotranspose.) Retroelements are abun-\ndant in eukaryotic genomes, and often constitute large por-\ntions of nuclear DNA, including /C2440% of the human\ngenome and /C2460% in maize (5,6). In general, eukaryotic\nretroelements are thought to survive as selﬁsh DNAs and to\nhave deleterious eﬀects on their hosts (7–9). It is not sur-\nprising, however, given their prevalence that beneﬁcial\nroles have occasionally evolved. For example, telomerase\nand the HeT-A/TART retroelements function to protect\nchromosomal ends (10–12). Still, such adaptations remain\nthe exception, and as a group the elements survive by\nspreading faster than they are lost. Thus, retroelements\nhave expanded dramatically and are one of the major hall-\nmarks of eukaryotic genomes.\nIn bacteria, reverse transcriptase was discovered con-\nsiderably later, as a component of retrons (13,14).\nCharacterized bacterial retroelements have now grown\nto three families, and include retrons, group II introns\nand diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) (15–18).\nIn contrast to eukaryotic elements, bacterial retroelements\nare not known to accumulate to high copy numbers within\na genome, with the greatest number being 28 group II\nintrons ( /C241% of the genome) in the cyanobacterium\nThermosynechococcus elongatus (19). Bacterial retroele-\nments are also distinctive because they are structurally\nsimple. Group II introns and retrons encode a single poly-\npeptide, while some viral retroelements encode over a\ndozen polypeptides (20).\nGroup II introns are the best-characterized bacterial ret-\nroelements and the only type known to exhibit autonomous\nmobility. These retroelements consist of an RT encoded\nwithin a catalytic, self-splicing RNA structure. RT\ndomains 1–7 constitute the palm and ﬁnger domains of\nthe polymerase protein, and their sequences are generally\nalignable across RTs (21). In contrast, domains 0 and 2a\nare shared among only a subset of RT classes (22,23).\nDownstream of the RT domain is domain X, which corre-\nsponds to the thumb of the polymerase, and has a second\nfunction in facilitating splicing of its host intron (maturase\nactivity) (24,25). Many group II open reading frames\n(ORFs) encode an endonuclease domain of the HNH\nfamily that is important for the mobility mechanism (26).\nIntron mobility is mediated by an ribonucleoprotein (RNP)\nconsisting of intron lariat and two molecules of intron-\nencoded protein, which site-speciﬁcally recognizes and\ninserts intron sequence into a /C2420- to 35-bp DNA target\n(17). The mechanism, known as target-primed reverse\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For the phage BPP-1 of Bordetella\npertussis, the retroelement consists of the RT, an RNA\ntemplate (TR), an accessory protein ( atd) and a target\nprotein gene ( mtd) that contains a C-terminal variable\nregion (VR) (29). The role of the DGR is to produce\ndiversity in the VR sequence of the phage tail protein,\nwhich is the region that contacts the bacterium during\ninfection. In doing so, the DGR mediates tropism\nswitching and allows the phage to infect cells with altered\nsurface composition, as occurs when Bordetella cells alter-\nnate between pathogenic and free-living phases. RTs of\nDGRs appear to be more closely related to group II\nintrons than retrons (30,31; our unpublished data).\nRetrons, although discovered ﬁrst, are the most unex-\nplained of bacterial retroelements. They do not appear to\nbe independently mobile, nor has a clear phenotype been\nassociated with them. Retrons consist of an RT and over-\nlapping multicopy single-stranded DNA/RNA (msRNA/\nmsDNA) genes. The RNA transcript of the msRNA/\nmsDNA sequence folds into a speciﬁc secondary structure\nto which the RT binds (32). The RT partially reverse tran-\nscribes the RNA to form a branched RNA–DNA mole-\ncule linked by a 2\n0–50 bond. This msDNA accumulates to\nhigh levels in some cases, but it remains unknown what\npurpose the msDNA serves, for either the retron or the\nhost cell (15,16,33).\nAn additional type of retroelement has been tentatively\nidentiﬁed, but is not well characterized. We refer to these\nelements here as Abi (abortive phage infection) retroele-\nments. The bacterium Lactococcus lactis encodes over 20\ngenetic systems that defend against phage infection. Each\nsystem blocks infection at one of many points in the phage\nreplication cycle (34). Two of these systems, abiA and abiK,\nencode genes related to RT (35,36). Mutations within the\nRT motifs of abiK block abortive infection in vivo (35);\nhowever, AbiA and AbiK proteins have not been shown\nbiochemically to have RT activity. An analogous property\nhas been reported for orf570 of the P2-like phage P2-EC30,\nwhich is associated with resistance to phage T5 (37).\nIn the course of identifying group II introns in bac-\nterial genomes, we found a number of RTs that appeared\nnot to belong to group II introns, retrons or DGRs.\nConsequently, we undertook a comprehensive search\nand analysis of RTs in eubacteria, archaea, and phages\nto examine whether novel RT classes exist, and to deter-\nmine how many types there might be. An independent\nstudy has previously identiﬁed eight novel lineages of\nretroelements by analyzing gene neighborhoods of the\nRTs (38). Here, we identify an additional 9 groupings\nand 38 unclassiﬁed RTs and present a comprehensive\noverview of RTs in bacteria.\nMETHODS\nCompilation of the RT data set\nRTs were identiﬁed in GenBank (July 2007) using\nPSI-BLAST (39) with a set of 25 RT queries\n(Supplementary Table S1). Fifteen of these RTs have\nbeen previously identiﬁed in searches designed to ﬁnd\ndistant RT relatives of group II introns, retrons and\nDGRs. For example, BLAST searches with AbiA and\nAbiK sequences produced weak hits having RT sequence\nmotifs, and using these hits as queries in further cycles,\na collection of putative RT ORFs was acquired. In\nPSI-BLAST, the ﬁrst iteration identiﬁes closely related\nsequences by standard BLASTP, while subsequent\niterations construct a PSSM (position speciﬁc scoring\nmatrix) based on the results of the previous cycle, and\nthis sequence proﬁle is then used as a query to identify\nmore distant relatives. In practice, we ﬁnd that ORFs\nacquired in the ﬁrst search are sometimes absent in sub-\nsequent iterations, and that later iterations often result in\nonly a small number of new sequences and can result in\nartifactual hits. Thus, we chose to use a large number\nof queries and a relatively small number of iterations to\nmaximize the eﬃciency of the search. After each itera-\ntion, sequences with an e-value of <0.005 were retained.\nIterations 2–4 recovered from 368 to 625 sequences, and\npooling the results of all four iterations resulted in\napproximately 600–800 sequences. By using a variety of\nqueries for PSI-BLAST, it was found that all group II\nintron queries resulted in highly similar RT sets ( /C2495%\nidentical). Importantly, ORFs recovered from each query\ninvariably included distantly related RTs (e.g. group II\nRTs identiﬁed Abi RTs and vice versa), and there was\na large degree of overlap in the ORF collections regard-\nless of the initial query. Equivalent searches were done\nfor eubacteria, archaea, and phages and proteins smaller\nthan 100 amino acids were discarded as probable frag-\nments or nonspeciﬁc hits. The ﬁnal collection of putative\nRTs was 1049 sequences, which included 11 RTs added\nduring subsequent BLAST searches and analyses of\nnovel groups.\nClassification of sequences\nFor practical purposes, the 1049 RTs were divided into 10\nsets, and each set was aligned with 32 reference sequences\nof group II introns, retrons, DGRs and Abi elements\nusing CLUSTAL W (40). The reference sequences were\nchosen to represent the known phylogenetic breadth of\neach RT group (Supplementary Table S2). Initial phylo-\ngenetic analyses were done using the NJ algorithm with\nuncorrected distances as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10\n(41). Sequences belonging to group II introns, retrons\nand DGRs were inferred by identifying the smallest\nmonophyletic group including all reference sequences for\na particular type of RT element. These groups were then\naligned automatically, and reﬁned manually in Bioedit\nv7.0.5.2 (42) in order to identify sequence hallmarks\nunique for each group (domain X for group II introns,\nregions X and Y for retrons, TR–VR repeats for\nDGRs). Other groupings were determined based on the\nidentiﬁcation of nearest neighbors using local BLAST\nand reciprocal BLAST, and examination for synapomor-\nphies in the ORF regions outside the RT domains,\ni.e. appended domains and other shared sequences. For\nsome RTs, additional phylogenetic analyses were done\n7220\nNucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22\nto conﬁrm monophyly of classes and/or relationships\nto previously identiﬁed elements. This was done using\nthe maximum likelihood criterion with the RtREV\nmodel (43) including an invariant sites parameter as imple-\nmented in RAxML (44). For these analyses, 100 bootstrap\nreplicates were also completed. Due to limited number of\nalignable characters, this could only be done for a subset\nof the RTs. Speciﬁcally one tree was made for group II\nintrons and the group II-like classes (213 amino acids\nwith 112 RTs), a second tree of retrons (157 amino\nacids with 96 retrons) and a third one of DGRs (data\nnot shown).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nCompilation and classification of bacterial RT genes\nRT ORFs in eubacteria, archaea and phages were identi-\nﬁed in GenBank using PSI-BLAST and a diverse set of 25\nbacterial RT queries (see Methods section). The queries\nincluded ORFs representing group II introns, retrons,\nDGRs and Abi elements, as well as 15 RTs previously\nidentiﬁed as unlikely to belong to these classes (Supple-\nmentary Table S1). For each query, four iterations of\nPSI-BLAST were done and the hits from all four searches\nwere pooled. In preliminary searches, we found that this\nsearch strategy (i.e. relatively few iterations with a large\nnumber of queries) was the best method for retrieving\nthe most comprehensive and diverse set of sequences\n(see Methods section for further details). The results of\nthe 25 searches were pooled into a single nonredundant\nset for a total of 1049 putative RT ORFs (Supplementary\nData S1).\nIn order to test the thoroughness of this strategy,\nwe repeated the PSI-BLAST search at the end of the\nstudy using three newly identiﬁed RTs (gi|124009057,\ngi|91202364, gi|89895550) which are not closely related\nto any initial queries. The purpose was to ﬁnd whether\n‘outlier’ RTs would identify even more diverse RT\nsequences. However, these queries primarily retrieved the\nRTs found in the initial search, and no new groups were\ndiscovered. For this reason, as well as the overall redun-\ndancy of RTs found when using diﬀerent queries, we\nbelieve that the search strategy approached saturation,\nand that our data set reﬂects the composition of RTs\npresent in GenBank.\nThe collected RT sequences are highly diverse, with\nfewer than 100 amino acids alignable across the set,\nthus preventing robust phylogenetic analyses (below).\nNevertheless, neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were useful in\nthe initial steps of clustering related sequences and iden-\ntifying the RTs of group II introns, retrons and DGRs.\nNJ trees were constructed in batches of approximately\n100 unknown ORFs along with 30 reference sequences\nspanning the diversity of group II introns, retrons and\nDGRs (Supplementary Table S2). ORFs were putatively\nassigned to one of these classes based on the NJ trees,\nand further alignments within each subset allowed con-\nﬁrmation and reﬁnement of the classiﬁcations based\non sequence hallmarks. Identiﬁcations of group II introns\nwere supported by the presence of a domain X motif (25),\nand also by comparison with our highly curated intron\ndatabase [(45); www.fw.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/]. In\nsome cases, group II introns were conﬁrmed by generating\nintron RNA secondary structures. In this way, 742 ORFs\nwere designated group II introns, although many are\nduplicate copies or fragments (below). Similarly, 113\nORFs were assigned as retron RTs and were supported\nby the sequence hallmarks X and Y (15). Thirty-six DGRs\nwere veriﬁed by identiﬁcation of potential TR–VR repeats\nadjacent to the RT (29).\nClassiﬁcation of Abi RTs is problematic because\nthe three elements reported to have abortive infection\nproperties (AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2) are distantly related,\nwith only three RT domains alignable between them\n(Figure 1). One possibility is that Abi elements constitute\nan extremely diverse but monophyletic lineage of RTs\ninvolved in phage abortive infection. Alternatively, mul-\ntiple lineages of RTs may have evolved roles in abortive\ninfection. In either case, one cannot conﬁdently conclude\nwhich other RTs in the set might have abortive infection\nproperties. Hence, we assign only three close relatives\nas belonging to the AbiK group and eight to the Abi-P2\ngroup, while AbiA has no close relatives.\nThe remaining 146 ORFs were further analyzed by\nmanual alignment and BLASTP searches to conﬁrm that\nthey are bacterial RTs rather than nonspeciﬁc BLAST\nhits. In total, 121 ORFs were alignable with RT motifs,\nbut three of these were discarded as eukaryotic RTs. In the\nend, 80 RTs were assigned to 14 additional groups based\non reciprocal local BLAST best-hits, shared features\noutside of the RT domains, and in some cases phyloge-\nnetic support (Figures 1 and 2). Thirty-eight RTs remain\nunclassiﬁed because they form less convincing groups or\ngroups of two members.\nClasses of RTs in bacteria\nGroup II introns.The largest category of RTs in bacteria is\nthe family of group II intron-encoded proteins, with 742\nsequences. Of these, approximately 219 are full-length,\nunique introns (www.fw.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/), and\nthe remaining are either truncated copies, multiple copies\nwithin genomes or redundant GenBank entries. Even so,\nthey comprise the largest group of bacterial RTs. Based on\nphylogenetic analyses of the RT, the introns fall into eight\nclasses (A, B, C, D, E, F, ML and CL) with each class being\nassociated with a distinct RNA secondary structure (45).\nAll of these classes are expected to possess the canonical\nproperties of group II introns, namely ribozyme-based\nsplicing and retromobility.\nGroup II intron-like RTs. A number of RTs initially\nappeared to be group II introns, but no associated RNA\nstructures could be found. While it is not possible to\nexclude the existence of an associated ribozyme, there is\nno secondary structure motif similar to the highly con-\nserved catalytic domain 5 of known group II introns.\nHence, if these RTs are associated with introns, their ribo-\nzyme structure would have to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent\nfrom known group II introns, or their introns might be\nencoded elsewhere in the genome.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 227221\nA phylogenetic tree of the group II-like (G2L) RTs\nalong with a selection of group II intron RTs shows that\nthey fall into ﬁve classes (G2L1–G2L5) (Figure 2;\nSupplementary Data S2). It is important to note that\nG2L1 is paraphyletic; however, all members share a con-\nserved C-terminal extension and other genomic features\nthat suggest a similar function (below). A notable feature\nof the G2L classes is the conservation of the maturase\n(splicing) motif of domain X in three groups (G2L3,\nG2L4 and G2L5) despite the apparent lack of an intron\nRNA structure. In addition, G2L5 RTs have a conserved\nsequence change at the active site of the protein in domain\n5 (DD to DN), suggesting that the protein has lost\npolymerase activity, and possibly has acquired another\nactivity in conjunction with its approximately 500 amino\nacids N-terminal extension.\nWhile RTs of G2L3-5 have few clues to suggest speciﬁc\nproperties, all RTs of G2L1 and G2L2 are associated\nwith CRISPR elements (Clustered Regularly Interspaced\nShort Palindromic Repeats). CRISPR elements are a\nrecently identiﬁed type of genetic cassette and repetitive\narray found widely across eubacteria and archaea (46,47).\nThe function of CRISPR elements is to provide resistance\nagainst phage infections. After a CRISPR-containing\nbacterium is infected by phage, resistant bacteria emerge\nwhich have phage sequence integrated into the CRISPR\narrays, and the bacteria are resistant to future infections\nby that phage (48). Resistance is believed to be mediated\nFigure 1. RTs identiﬁed in eubacterial, archaeal and phage genomes. RTs were classiﬁed based on limited phylogenetic analyses, BLAST scores and\nsequence examination for synapomorphies. The number of RTs per group is indicated in parentheses and by triangle size. Domain structures are\ndepicted in black (alignable with group II introns), gray (uncertain alignment) and white (lack of alignability). Additional domains, including\ndomains of unknown function (DUFs), are in light gray squares, with parentheses indicating that some members lack the domain. In this ﬁgure,\nthe designation of an extension as a DUF indicates that the amino acid sequence is conserved within the group. Groups corresponding to lineages in\nKojima and Kanehisa (38) are as follows: G2L1 [H1, H2, H3 in (38)]; G2L2, (H4); UG1 (F1); UG3 (G); UG5 (F2); UG6 (E); UG8 (G); UG9 (D);\nretrons (A); and DGRs (B, C).\n7222 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22\nby an enzymatic complex composed of several proteins\nand an RNA generated from the CRISPR array (46).\nThe mechanism for sequence integration into CRISPR\narrays remains unknown.\nEssentially all CRISPR elements contain a CRISPR-\nassociated gene ( cas1), which is a putative integrase and\ncontains the conserved domain COG1518. In G2L1\nORFs, the COG1518 domain is fused to the RT ORF as\napproximately 400 amino acids C-terminal extension,\nwhile for G2L2 RTs this domain is a free-standing ORF\nlocated 31- to 501-bp downstream of the RT gene. It is\ntempting to speculate that G2L1 and G2L2 RTs are\ninvolved in the insertion of new phage sequences into\nthe CRISPR arrays using a mechanism analogous to\nTPRT insertion of group II introns (49). However, only\na minority of CRISPR elements have an associated RT\ngene (50), and so such a mechanism is unlikely to be gen-\neral. A ﬁnal note is that the paraphyletic nature of the\nCRISPR-associated RTs (Figure 2) indicates that RTs\nwere independently acquired by CRISPR elements at\nleast twice. Consistent with this, the RT-associated\nCOG1518 domains are themselves not a monophyletic\nlineage (50).\nRetrons/Retron-like RTs. The retron group is the second\nlargest in bacteria with 113 members, of which 97 are\nunique and 16 are highly similar sequences usually from\nrelated strains. Members of this group share the retron-\nspeciﬁc regions X and Y (15). Region Y lies within RT\ndomain 7 and has been shown to be functionally impor-\ntant for recognizing the msRNA structure for the priming\nreaction (32). The role of region X, which lies between\ndomains 2 and 3, is less clear but also seems to be impor-\ntant for the synthesis of msDNA. The retron/retron-like\ngroup is highly diverse in sequence, making it diﬃcult\nto ascertain whether all of its members have the same\nproperties as characterized retrons. We did not attempt\nto identify potential msRNA/msDNA secondary struc-\ntures as a means of veriﬁcation because we considered\nthe likelihood of false positives to be too great. Phyloge-\nnetic analysis of the RTs shows that characterized retrons\nare found throughout much of the tree (Figure 3; Supple-\nmentary Data S3). Moreover, RTs identiﬁed as retrons in\nthe literature without experimental veriﬁcation (15) are\neven more widely distributed. Thus, it seems likely that\nmost RTs in this group are actual retrons. This set of\nretron RTs is a signiﬁcant increase from approximately\n30 that were previously reported (15).\nDGRs. Our set of DGRs includes 36 RTs found in eight\nphyla of bacteria and two bacteriophages. All of the\nRT sequences are ﬂanked by potential TR–VR repeats,\nconsistent with known DGR features. These DGRs\nare expected to possess equivalent diversity-generating\nproperties for their target VR sequence as shown for the\nBPP-1 phage of B. pertussis(29). As previously noted (18),\nat least some of the DGRs appear not to be phage-\nassociated, suggesting that the target genes are not\nrestricted to phage tail proteins.\nOther RT groups. We identiﬁed three groups of Abi RTs\nwhose members are putatively involved in defense against\nphage infections. The three groups are relatively small,\nFigure 2. A maximum likelihood tree of group II introns and group\nII-like (G2L) RTs. Group II introns include representatives of the\nmajor intron classes [B–F, mitochondria-like (ML), chloroplast-like\n(CL)] as well as one that is currently unclassiﬁed (G2). Group II-like\nclasses (G2L1–G2L5) are highlighted with gray ovals. Nodes that\nhave a bootstrap value >70 are indicated with black circles.

Those sequences with experimental\nsupport are shown with a gray circle and their previously assigned\nname (15). The tree ﬁle with GenBank gene identiﬁcation numbers is\navailable in Supplementary Data S3.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 227223\nhaving one, three and eight members, respectively for\nAbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2 groups. None of the three\ngroups have lengthy domains appended to the RT.\nShorter amino acid extensions can be found (less than\n200 amino acids) which may encode additional functions,\nbut these sequences are not conserved across bacteria.\nNine classes of ‘unknown group’ RTs were deﬁned\n(UG1-9) having 3–14 members each. Four of these\ngroups have C-terminal extensions ranging in length\nfrom approximately 200–800 amino acids, which may\ncontribute novel biochemical activities (Figure 1). The\nappended domains are conserved in sequence within\nthe groups with the exception of UG6. The C-terminal\ndomains are not highly similar to proteins of known\nfunction, although the UG5 extension gives a very weak\nmatch to a carbon–nitrogen hydrolase domain.\nThirty-eight RTs remained unclassiﬁed because they fell\ninto less convincing groupings or formed pairs of related\nRTs. Ten of these RTs are obviously truncated, while\nwe predict that many of the remainder are functional\ndue to the absence of stop codons in their long ORFs.\nMost unusual among these RTs are two single examples\n(gi|118579436 and gi|42524098) with long extensions, of\nwhich one (gi|42524098) has similarity to a primase at\nthe N-terminus (Figure 1). These two RT examples are\nlikely to possess novel activities or to be involved in\nnovel processes because of the very lengthy sequences\nappended to the RT domains.\nIn Kojima and Kanehisa (38), eight novel RT groups\nwere identiﬁed in bacteria, based partially on fused and\nﬂanking genes. The RT groups identiﬁed here are consis-\ntent with that study, although we identify an additional\nnine groups (G2L3, 4, 5, UG2, 4, 7, AbiA, AbiK and\nAbi-P2), and 38 unclassiﬁed ORFs [see Figure 1 legend\nfor correspondence with (38)]. Interestingly, Kojima and\nKanehisa (38) observed that RTs of UG3 and UG8 are\nexclusively found in pairs, in a retroelement they call\nGroup G, and this observation holds true with the slightly\nexpanded number of RTs in our set. Another goal of that\nstudy was to examine gene neighborhoods. The most\nsigniﬁcant observations were four RT lineages reported\nto be ﬂanked by genes for DNA polymerase A, a primase\nor a hydrolase. We examined the immediate ﬂanking\nsequences ( /C610 000 kb) of the new groups of RTs found\nin our study, but did not ﬁnd any conserved ﬂanking genes\nthat would further characterize the retroelements.\nDiversity of bacterial RTs\nThe set of compiled bacterial RTs is remarkably diverse,\nwith only 59 amino acids alignable across the entire set\n(Figure 4). Table 1 presents data on sequence diversity\nfor each of the RT groups. The most valid measure may\nbe the average pairwise distance of the RTs within each\ngroup, using only the 59 characters alignable across\nall RTs. By that measure, the retron/retron-like group is\nmore diverse than group II introns (i.e. it has a greater\naverage pairwise distance), while DGRs have roughly\nthe same diversity. Seven other classes have equal or\ngreater pairwise distances compared to group II introns,\nsuggesting at least equal diversity despite fewer members\nin the groups.\nA limitation of this measurement is its reliance on a\nsmall number of characters, all of which are likely to be\nhighly constrained. To increase the number of characters,\npairwise distances were determined based on all alignable\npositions for RT domains 1–7 within each class (130–298\namino acids; column 5 in Table 1). These distances are\nbased on diﬀerent character sets for each group, but\nnevertheless the same conclusion is suggested: retrons\nare more diverse than group II introns, DGRs roughly\nequal and seven other groups have at least as much diver-\nsity as group II introns. A third measure is simply the\nnumber of alignable characters within each class, across\nRT domains 1–7. Consistent with the previous conclu-\nsions, retrons have fewer alignable characters than group\nII introns (157 versus 177), DGRs have about the same\nnumber (179 versus 177) and ﬁve other groups have fewer\nalignable characters (126–167 amino acids). Considering\nthese data together, it is clear that RTs in bacteria are\nremarkably diverse in sequence, and they may be function-\nally diverse as well.\nInterestingly, a comparison with eukaryotic RT\nsequences suggests greater diversity among bacterial\nRTs. This inference is drawn from the observation that\ndomains 1, 2 and 7 are unalignable for many bacterial\nRTs, while obviously present in most eukaryotic RTs\n(Figure 4). In addition, some bacterial RTs have extreme\namino acid substitutions. For example, in the Y/FxDD\nmotif of the catalytic site, the x is nearly always hydro-\nphobic (A, I, V and M), whereas the bacterial group Abi-\nP2 has a conserved R.\nMobility of the retroelements\nIt is striking that among this set, group II introns are the\nonly RTs with clear evidence of retromobility. Mobility\nof the introns is indicated in sequence data by the many\nredundant and truncated copies, and speciﬁcally by multi-\nple intron copies at diﬀerent locations in a single genome.\nFurthermore, the exact boundaries of the mobile DNA\nunit can be determined when identical introns are found\nin diﬀerent exons. Among other RTs, the only other pos-\nsible example of active retromobility is for UG4, where two\nRTs (gi|151571385 and gi|151571856) are >90% identical\nand are found within the same genome ( Francisella tular-\nensis subsp. novicida GA99-3548). The ﬂanking sequences\nare identical for /C24100 bp upstream of the RT ORFs,\nbut there is no discernable identity in their 3\n0-ﬂanking\nregions. This example is the only instance apart from\ngroup II introns in which we ﬁnd closely related RTs\nwithin the same genome. We looked for additional exam-\nples of potential mobility by comparing the genomic\nlocations of highly similar RTs found in closely related\norganisms. In all cases, these RTs were found in identical\ngenomic locations. In addition, we found no lengthy con-\nserved target site duplications that could signify recent\nmobility. The lack of evidence for independent mobility\nof RTs (other than group II introns and UG4) suggests\neither that they are not active for retromobility, or that\nthey transpose too infrequently to detect by these criteria.\n7224\nNucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 22\nOn the other hand, the RTs do not appear to be inher-\nited strictly vertically, as suggested from their patchy\ndistributions. For example, the retrons in our collection\nare found in a large variety of species, but are on the whole\ninfrequent across bacteria. The distribution of retrons\nwithin closely related strains has previously been shown\nto be highly sporadic for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ,\nProteus and Salmonella (50,51), while there appears to\nbe a degree of vertical inheritance in myxobacteria (15).\nThe simplest explanation for this sporadic phylogenetic\ndistribution is RT-independent horizontal transfers,\nwhich is also consistent with the ﬁnding of some\nretrons within prophages (53). DGRs and other groups\nof RTs similarly have wide and irregular distributions,\nsuggesting nonvertical inheritance (31). Kojima and\nKanehisa (38) made the same observation for UG1,\nUG3/8, UG5, UG6 and UG9.\nFunctions of the retroelements\nWith the exception of G2L5, all groups in this study\npossess three aspartate residues in motifs that putatively\ncorrespond to the active site (Figure 4; Supplementary\nFigure S1), which is consistent with having RT activity.\nWe consider it likely that all of these protein families fold\ninto a 3D structure similar to other RTs and have the\ncorresponding enzymatic activities. Although there are a\nnumber of examples in which RT domains are unalignable\n(Figures 1 and 4), in these cases there are suﬃcient\namino acids to correspond to the ‘missing’ domains,\nFigure 4. Alignment of RT domains. An alignment of RT domains 0–7 is shown for representative bacterial and eukaryotic RTs. The predicted three\ncatalytic residues at the RT active site are indicated with asterisks. Residues judged to be alignable across all bacterial RTs (and used in distance\ncalculations for Table 1) are indicated with a plus sign at the bottom of the alignment. Absence of sequence in the ﬁgure indicates the lack of\nalignability rather than the absence of amino acids. Sequences considered ambiguously aligned (based on a more comprehensive set of RTs than\nthose depicted in the ﬁgure) are indicated with light shading.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 227225\nwith the possible exception of domain 2a. Thus, the\nabsence of domains in Figures 1 and 4 signiﬁes that the\nsequences cannot be aligned unambiguously, but does not\nnecessarily imply that the structural domains are absent\nfrom the proteins.\nIn general, it is likely that an element with RT activity\nwill survive using one of two strategies (or a combination\nof these). An RT may persist by helping the element pro-\npagate as a selﬁsh DNA, or alternatively by providing a\nbeneﬁt to the host organism. Group II introns are clearly\nselﬁsh DNAs, because they do not have a discernable\nhost-related function and are mobile. In contrast, ﬁve\nother groups of RTs appear to belong to the second\ncategory and confer a useful function. Interestingly, all\nof these functions pertain to either resistance to phage\ninfections [CRISPRs (G2L1, G2L2), AbiA, AbiK and\nAbi-P2] or promotion of phage infections (DGRs). The\nlack of evidence for active retrotransposition of other\nuncharacterized RTs suggests that they have useful func-\ntions, perhaps playing roles in phage–host or phage–phage\nconﬂicts.\nIn considering possible roles of the RTs, it is nota-\nble that 11 diﬀerent extensions are fused to the RT\ndomains (Figure 1), suggesting that a variety of biochem-\nical activities are coupled to reverse transcription. These\ndomains include an endonuclease (group II introns), an\nintegrase (G2L1) and a primase (unclassiﬁed), while the\nremainder have no predicted function. One diﬃculty in\npredicting function based on sequence alone is illustrated\nby CRISPR RTs, which are closely related to group II\nintron RTs (particularly G2L2; Figure 2), yet are impli-\ncated in a very diﬀerent biological process. This observa-\ntion cautions against assuming shared properties for\nrelated RTs, and greatly expands the plausible range of\nactivities and processes that might be carried out by the\ncollection of RTs.\nPhylogenetic distribution of RTs\nTo address the phylogenetic distribution in eubacteria, we\nconsidered the RT content of 519 completed genomes.\nApproximately 25% of the genomes have at least one\nRT, with 9% containing multiple RTs. These numbers\nare lower estimates, as they are based on a set of nonre-\ndundant RTs, such that very closely related RT copies\nwithin a genome (i.e. group II introns and UG4) are\ncounted as a single RT. The RTs are widely distributed\nacross taxa, being found in nearly every eubacterial group\n(11/14 as deﬁned by NCBI) (Figure 5; Supplementary\nTable S3). Bacterial groups that lack an RT are also\nunderrepresented in GenBank, as indicated by the\nnumber of completed genome sequences (Figure 5).\nSimilarly, the number of RTs in each group is roughly\nproportional to the number of sequenced genomes,\nalthough there are exceptions (compare bacteroidetes/\nchlorobi group versus mollicutes) (Figure 5). We conclude\nthat RTs do not appear to be excluded from particular\nbacterial groups or have extreme biases in their\ndistribution.\nIn contrast, RTs are far less frequent in archaea in our\ndata set. Archaeal RTs are mainly restricted to\nTable 1.

Interestingly, the RTs found within archaea\ndo not constitute an independent lineage. If archaeal-spe-\nciﬁc lineages exist, it would seem that they must be too\ndivergent from known RTs to identify by our search strat-\negy, or are suﬃciently rare to be missed in our sample size.\nEvolutionary implications\nThe large number of RT types in bacteria raises many new\npossibilities for the origins of eukaryotic retroelements. It\nis frequently hypothesized that eukaryotic RTs, and spe-\nciﬁcally non-LTR elements, are descended from group II\nintrons (54–56). This is based on the similar RT sequences\nand mobility mechanisms of group II introns and non-\nLTR retroelements, and also the general increase in com-\nplexity of retroelements in eukaryotes. Also supporting\nthis idea is the fact that group II introns are present in\norganelles, and could be introduced into nuclear chromo-\nsomes via the well-known process of endosymbiotic gene\ntransfer (57). Although there are now many more poten-\ntial bacterial ancestors of non-LTR elements, we still con-\nsider group II introns to be the most likely source, because\nthey are the only bacterial RTs that are clearly mobile.\nAn alternative to a single bacterial ancestor of eukar-\nyotic RTs is multiple introductions of bacterial RTs into\neukaryotes. This possibility is made more plausible by the\nﬁndings in this study. However, due to high sequence\ndivergence, this issue cannot be resolved by phylogenet-\nics alone. A comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic\nsequences in Figure 4 does not reveal to us clear evi-\ndence between individual eukaryotic and prokaryotic\ngroups that would suggest a speciﬁc bacterial source for\na eukaryotic RT. Thus, the available sequence data appear\nequally consistent with either a single or multiple event\nintroduction of RTs into eukaryotes.\nAlthough reconstruction of global phylogenetic rela-\ntionships is not possible, the data do suggest that group\nII introns can readily form derivatives and acquire new\nfunctions. This inference is based on the multiple lineages\nof group II intron-related RTs, of which two have adapted\nroles in phage defense (G2L1 and G2L2), one has appar-\nently lost RT activity (G2L5), and two have unknown\nfunctions. While it is possible that one of these G2L\nclasses was ancestral to the cluster depicted in Figure 2\nrather than group II introns, this seems less likely given\nthe increased opportunity that group II introns have\nto form derivatives, due to their abundance, diversity\nand mobility. The ability of group II introns to evolve\ninto new forms is consistent with the versatility expected\nfor the putative ancestors of spliceosomal introns.\nCONCLUSIONS\nReverse transcriptases in bacteria appear to be fundamen-\ntally diﬀerent from those in eukaryotes. They diﬀer dra-\nmatically in prevalence across species and in abundance\nwithin genomes. Eukaryotic retroelements are found in\nnearly every species, and often comprise a large propor-\ntion of a genome. In contrast, most bacteria do not con-\ntain a RT and when present they are far less abundant\nwithin the genome ( /C201%). This pattern mirrors that of\nmobile DNA in bacteria in general. The lower content\nof bacterial mobile elements is thought to reﬂect the\nlarge population sizes with concomitant increase in eﬃ-\ncacy of selection (58). Based on this logic, we predict\nthat a greater proportion of RTs in bacteria will be advan-\ntageous to their hosts compared to eukaryotic elements, a\nhypothesis consistent with data in this study.\nFinally, it is clear that with currently accumulated\nsequence data, we have not yet reached saturation with\nregard to the number of bacterial RT groups. This con-\nclusion is based on the number of RT types having only\none or a few representatives in the data set. It is virtually\nassured that additional retroelement types are yet to be\ndiscovered beyond the 20 groups and 11 architectures set\nforth here. Based on the unique biochemical reactions\ncarried out by known bacterial retroelements (reverse\nsplicing into DNA, retrohoming, mutagenic homing and\nmsDNA synthesis) and their range of biological processes\n(proliferation as selﬁsh DNA, tropism switching and\nabortive phage infection), there is great potential for\nadditional novel properties to be found among the diver-\nsity of RTs in bacteria.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSupplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to Sylvain Moineau (U.

Upon this phenomenon, it has been show n that msDNA is only produced by Eubacteria because many \nEubacteria species contained reverse transcriptase in their specia l retro-element. We have screened around 111 Archaea at KEGG \n(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database available at genome net server and observed three Methanosarcina species \n(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei), which also contained reverse transcriptase in their genome sequences. This observation of \nreverse transcriptase in Archaea raises questions regarding the or igin of this enzyme. The evolut ionary relationship between these \ntwo domains of life (Eubacteria and Archaea) hinges upon the phen omenon of retrons. Interestingly, the evolutionary trees based  \non the reverse transcriptases (RTs) and 16S ribosomal RNAs poin t out that all the Eubacteria RTs were descended from Archaea \nRTs during their evolutionary times. In addition, we also ha ve shown some significant structural features among the newly \nidentified msDNA-Yf79 in Yersinia frederiksenii with other of its related msDNAs (m sDNA-St85, msDNA-Vc95, msDNA-Vp96, \nmsDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83) from pathogenic bacteria. Together  the degree of sequence conservation among these msDNAs, \nthe evolutionary trees and the distribution of these ret (reverse transcriptase) genes suggest a possible evolutionary scenario. The \nsingle common ancestor of the organisms of Eubact eria and Archaea subgroups probably achieved this ret gene during their \nevolution through the vertical descent rather than the horizontal  transformations followed by integration into this organism \ngenome by a mechanism related to phage recognition and/or transposition. \n \nKeywords: msDNA, reverse transcriptase, phylogenetic tree. \n \n \n \nBackground: \nBacterial chromosomes often carry integrated genetic elements \n(for example transposons, prophages and islands) whose \nprecise functions and contribution to the evolutionary fitness of \nthe host bacterium are still unknown [1]. These elements are \noften associated with the pathogenicity of the organisms, for \nexample the CTX φ prophage, which encodes cholera toxin in \nVibrio cholerae [1]. Retron is also a transposable element [2] \nfound in various pathogenic bacteria [3]. The retron is \nconsisting of three regions- msr (encodes RNA part of msDNA), \nmsd (encodes DNA part of msDNA) and a ret gene for reverse \ntranscriptase (RT) [4-6]. This enzyme is responsible for the \nBIOINFORMATION open access \n \nISSN 0973-2063 (online) 0973-8894 (print)   \nBioinformation 7(4):176-179 (2011) 177  © 2011 Biomedical Informatics\n \nproduction of multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) \ncontaining both DNA and RNA covalently linked by a \nbranched rG residue [4-6]. Although, reverse transcriptase (RT) \nwas first discovered in virus [7], now this enzyme is frequently \nfound in bacteria which are then prokaryotic reverse \ntranscriptase to be discovered [4-6]. The discovery of reverse \ntranscriptase in bacteria raises questions regarding the origin of \nthis enzyme. The reverse transcriptase (RT) consisting of several \nconserved regions common to all retrons, can thus be used for a \ncomprehensive evolutionary anal y s i s  o f  r e t r o n s .  T o  s o l v e  a  \nquestion regarding the origin of retron encoding ret (reverse \ntranscriptase) gene, we have compared the retro-element \nreverse transcriptase (RT) sequen ces in different bacteria. The \nphylogenetic trees constructed from this present study provide \na framework to appraise possible hypothesis for the origin and \nevolution of different categories of retrons present in different \norganisms. We have taken Eubacteria and Archaea for \nscreening purpose to see an evolutionary relationship between \nthese two domains of life on the basis of there ret (reverse \ntranscriptase) genes.  \n \nMethodology: \nSequence Retrieval \nThe amino acid sequences of reverse transcriptase (RT) and the \nnucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) such as \nArchaea:  Methanosarcina species: ( M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and \nM.mazei); Eubacteria: Yersinia species ( Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis); \nMyxobacteria species ( S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, \nN.exedens and M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, \nV.parahaemolyticus and V.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium; \nand Escherichia coli  species (Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific \nEnterobacteria phage phiR73, ECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and \nECOR58)- were retrieved  from ExPASy proteomics server \n(http://expasy.org/). In addition, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S \nrRNA) nucleotide sequences of Archaea: Methanosarcina species \n(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei ) and Eubacteria: Yersinia \nspecies ( Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species \n(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca\n, N.exedens and \nM.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus  and  \nV.mimicus); S. Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli  K-12 were \nretrieved from the KEGG or ganism database, Japan \n(http://www.genome.jp/). \n \nGeneration of Gene and Phylogenetic Trees \nIdentical conserved regions of reverse transcriptase (RT) amino \nacid sequences of Archaea:  Methanosarcina species: \n(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei ); Eubacteria: Yersinia \nspecies ( Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species \n(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and \nM.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and \nV.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli species \n(Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific Enterobacteria phage phiR73, \nECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and ECOR58) scored in the alignment \nconstructed by using (CLUSTALW) \n(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) [8] were used \nto generate a gene ( ret) tree.   The sequence alignment was \nperformed under default conditions and the gene tree was \nconstructed by the neighbor-joining [9] and distance matrix \nmethods. The poorly aligned N-terminals and C-terminals \nsequence of alignments and also the internal gaps residue were \ntaken off from the alignments to  make a precise evolutionary \ntree by using the Jalview program [10]. The phylogenetic tree of \n16S ribosomal RNAs of those organisms was also constructed \nbased on their nucleotide sequences by using (CLUSTALW) \n(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) [8].  \n \n \nFigure 1:  Possible secondary structures of multi-copy single-\nstranded DNAs (msDNAs) from pathogenic bacteria \n(Y.frederiksenii, S.typhimurium, V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and \nEscherichia coli  strains 110 & 161) . The branching guanine (G) \nresidue in RNA portion of msDNAs is circled and forming a 2 ', \n5'-phosphodiester bond with DNA portion of msDNAs (A-F). \nBoth the DNA and RNA secondary stem loop structures were \nsuggested on the basis of their sequences. The RNA portion was \nboxed and the numbers of RNA and DNA were begun from 5' \nends. The conserved nucleotides are indicated by stars in all \nmsDNAs. The msDNA-Yf79 (A) is predicted from Yersinia \nfrederiksenii [11], msDNA-St85 (B) is isolated from S.typhimurium \n[13], msDNA-Vc95 (C) is from V.cholerae [14], msDNA-Vp96 (D) \nis from V.parahaemolyticus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished \ndata), msDNA-Ec78 (E) is from E.coli strain 110 [12] and \nmsDNA-Ec83 (F) from E.coli strain 161 [3]. The conserved \nsequence for cleavage is indicated by boxes and base \nsubstitution pointed out by arrows. \n \nResults and discussion: \nComparative Study of Multicopy Single-Stranded DNA \n(msDNA) Structures \nRecently, we have perceived that a new msDNA-Yf79 exist in \nYersinia frederiksenii  ATCC 33641 contig01029  cell types and \ncompared it’s properties to that of St-85, Vc-95 and Vp-96 [11]. \nHowever, the present study has revealed the close relatedness \nof this msDNA-Yf79 with msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 from \nE.coli strains 110, 161 respectively (Figure 2)  [ 12, 3] . These \nmsDNAs shared a number of highly conserved nucleotides in \ntheir DNA-RNA complex sequences (Figure 1).  The sequence \n5'-TAGA-3' box was conserved in msDNA-Yf79 [11], msDNA-\nSt85 [13], msDNA-Vc95 [14] and msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T, \n2003, unpublished data) (Figure 1A-1D).  The box 5'-TTGA-3' \nwas conserved in msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 [12, 3] . The \nconserved tetra nucleotides (5'-TTGA-3') would play an \nimportant role in the recognition and cleavage of msDNA by a \nhypothetical enzyme [15].  Furthermore, the second nucleotide \nthymine (T) was substituted by adenine (A) in the 5'-TAGA-3' \nbox of msDNA-Yf79 [11], -St85 [13], -Vc95 [14] and -Vp96 \n(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) (Figure 1A-1D).  The \nthird nucleotide guanine (G) in the two boxes of all msDNAs is \nconserved (Figure 1A-1E) and indicates the higher efficiency of \nBIOINFORMATION open access \n \nISSN 0973-2063 (online) 0973-8894 (print)   \nBioinformation 7(4):176-179 (2011) 178  © 2011 Biomedical Informatics\n \ncleavage of these msDNAs, because when the guanine (G) at \nthe third position change to cytosine (C), the effort of cleavage \nis moderately reduced [15]. In addition to these boxes, the fifth \nnucleotide adenine (A) at the 5' end of DNA part of msDNA-\nYf79 [11] and msDNA-Ec83 [3] (Figure 1A and 1F) may become \na target, because when this adenine (A) was substituted by any \npyrimidines, it reduces the overall msDNA accumulation [15]. \nWithin conserved nucleotides among all msDNAs (Figure 1)  \nthe nucleotide cytosine (C) at position 67 of msDNA-Yf79 [11] \nwas substituted by thymine (T), and thymine (T) at position 96 \nof msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) was \nsubstituted by cytosine (C) (Figure 1A, 1D). Furthermore, \nmsDNA-Ec83 [3] seems to be mutagenic (Figure 1F)  because \nmsDNA with any mismatched base pair in their DNA stems \ncould be mutagenic [16, 17].  However, other remaining \nmsDNAs (Figure 1A-1E) contained no such type of mismatched \nbase pairing in their DNA stem structures.  \n \n \nFigure 2:  Gene tree among Archaea- Methanosarcina species \n(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei ) and Eubacteria- Yersinia \nspecies ( Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis ); Myxobacteria species \n(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens, and \nM.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and \nV.mimicus); S.

Here, ND-indicates that the \nstrains were not tested for msDNA production and the (+) sign \nindicates the presence of msDNA. The distance between \nsequences is located just beside each RT. The following ExPASy \naccession numbers for the RT sequences were used in the \nphylogenetic construction: ( M.acetivorans-Q8TMH8, M.barker-\nQ46BR7, M.mazei- Q8PTN0); ( Y.frederiksenii  RT-Yf79-C4SUU2, \nY.pestis-Q7ARB2); ( S.cellulosum-A9GPU1\n, M.lichenicola- Q50210, \nS.aurantiaca- Q08Y90, N.exedens- Q8VRM1, M.xanthus-Q1D0F5); \n(V.cholerae RT-Vc95- Q9S1F2, V.parahaemolyticus-Q8L0W6, \nV.mimicus- D0HJ73); S.Typhimurium- E7UVY4; and Escherichia \ncoli species  strains 161 (RT-Ec83, Q47526); 110 (RT-Ec78, \nQ46666); (msDNA-Ec73 specific RT from  Enterobacteria phage \nphiR73, Q7M2A9); ECOR70 (RT-Ec107, Q05804); ECOB (RT-\nEc86, P23070); ECOR35 (RT-Ec67, P21325) and ECOR58 (RT-\nEc48, P71276). \n \nEvolutionary Relationship of RTs from Pathogenic Bacteria \nTo explore the evolution of reverse transcriptases (RTs), the \nphylogenetic analysis was performed among RT amino acid \nsequences.  Result exhibits a fundamental diversity among all \nthe reverse transcriptases (RTs) as RT-Yf79 ( Y. frederiksenii) [11] \nis closely related to the RT-Ec83 (E.coli strain 161) [3] rather than \nto the RT-Ec78 ( E.coli strain 110) [12], RT-Vp96 ( V. \nparahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), RT-\nVc95 ( V.cholerae) [14] and RT-St85 ( S.Typhimurium) [13].  RT-\nEc78 ( E.coli strain 110) [12] is closely related to RT-Vp96 ( V. \nparahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) as well \nas RT-Vc95 ( V.cholerae) [14] is closely related to the RT-St85 \n(S.Typhimurium) [13] (Figure 2). The msDNA-Ec73 specific RT \n(Enterobacteria phage phiR73) [18] is related to RT-Yf79, -Ec83, -\nEc78, -Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), -Vc95 and \n-St85 [11, 3, 12, 14, 13] . Although RT-Ec83, -Ec78 and -Ec73 [3, \n12, 18]  were from Escherichia species, they spread out from a \ncentral point (Figure 2).  Similarly, RT-Vc95 [14] and RT-Vp96 \n(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpu blished data) were from Vibrio \nspecies, but they are closely related to RT-St85 [13] and RT-Ec78 \n[12], respectively ( Figure 2). It was also observed that the high \nsimilarity and relatedness of all RTs from Archaea species and \nRT-S.cellulosum (Myxobacteria species) [19] is originated from \nArchaea RTs (Figure 2).  RT ( V. mimicus ) (Shimamoto T, 2003, \nunpublished data) is clos ely related to the RT- S.cellulosum \n(Myxobacteria species) [19] and   RTs from Archaea species \n(Figure 2). In addition, RT (Y.pestis) was descended from RTs of \nV. mimicus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) , S.cellulosum \n[19] and  Archaea species (Figure 2).  The remaining RTs \n(Myxobacteria species) [19] are related to RT-Ec107, -Ec86 and -\nEc67 [20, 21] . Among all RTs (Myxobacteria species) [19], \nespecially RTs - M.lichenicola and S.aurantiaca [19] have shown  \nhigher similarity, as their phylogenetic distance is too low \n(Figure 2).  Surprisingly, all the Eubacteria RTs are diverged \nfrom the Archaea species (Figure 2). Although RT-Ec48 is from \nE.coli species [22] this enzyme is distantly related with RTs of \nArchaea and Eubacteria species (Figure 2). \n \n \nFigure 3: Phylogeny of the two domains of life.

The \nphylogeny tree revealed that four of the five major phylogenetic \ngroups produce msDNAs perhaps acquired this ret gene during \ntheir evolution through vertic al descended rather than \nhorizontal transformation. This observation is consistent with \nthe hypothesis of   Rice and Lampson (1995) [19]. \n \nPerspectives \nThis study manifests that, the ret genes commonly perceived in \nEubacteria are unique compared with ret genes found in \nArchaea. Eubacteria ret genes of diverse types are probably \nwidespread and might be descended from the characteristics of \nthe Archaea world. This hypothesis is supported by the \nprevalence of distribution of ret genes, among a wide variety of \norganisms as documented here and in previous reports \n[11, 23]. \nXiong and Eickbush (1990) also have shown the origin and \nevolution of retro-elements in different organisms based upon \nreverse transcriptase sequences [23]. Though Archaea had been \ngrouped with bacteria as prokaryotes (archaebacteria), they \nhave an independent evolutionary history. With respect to the \nobservation of ret genes in Archaea, the observation suggests \nthat the RT enzyme played a role in the evolutionary emergence \nof Eubacteria from Archaea (or vice versa). Furthermore, \nreverse transcriptase (RT) is also frequently found in \nretroviruses like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [7]. \nNow these findings raise questions as to where ret gene \noriginates? Why are they so dive rse along with retron elements \nin these organisms? This statement is parallel to the popular \nchicken versus egg puzzles theory.  \n \nReferences: \n[1] Hassan F et al.

W e screened Y ersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 contig01029 for the presence of retroelement by\nusing bioinformatics tools and characterized a novel retron-Yf79 on the chromosome that encodes msDNA-Yf79. In this study, we\nperceived that, the codon usage of retron-Yf79 were noteworthy di ﬀerent from those of the Y. frederiksenii genome. It demonstrates\nthat, the retron-Yf79 was a foreign DNA element and integrated into this organism genome during their evolution. In addition to\nthis, we have observed a transposase gene which is located just downstream of retron-Yf79. So, the enzyme might be responsible\nfor the transposition of this novel retron element.\n1. Introduction\nFor the past 21 years, it has been shown that some pathogenic\nGram-negative bacteria strains contain genetic elements\ncalled retrons. Retron is a retroelement consisting of msr,\nwhich encodes the RNA part of msDNA, msd, which encodes\nthe DNA part of msDNA, and the ret gene for reverse\ntranscriptase (RT) [ 1]. The reverse transcriptase (RT) was\noriginally discovered in virus [ 2] as an essential enzyme for\nthe replication of retroviruses. Since the discovery of RT\nin myxobacteria [ 3]a n d Escherichia coli [4] an intriguing\nquestion have been raised concerning its origin and function\nin the prokaryotes [ 5].\nThe msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA) is com-\nposed of a small, single-stranded DNA, linked to a small,\nsingle-stranded RNA molecule. The 5\n′ end of the DNA\nmolecule is joined to an internal guanine base (G) residue of\nthe RNA molecule by a unique 2\n′,5 ′-phosphodiester bond\n[6]. Since msDNA was originally discovered in the Gram-\nnegative soil bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus [7] it was also\nisolated from aggregative adherence E. coli (AAEC) [ 8],\na classical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) [ 9]a n dm o r e\nrecently from Vibrio cholerae [10], Salmonella enterica ser-\novar Typhimurium [ 5], V. p a r a h a e m o l y t i c u sand V . mim-\nicus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data). Hence, RT\nmight have a role in diversiﬁcation of pathogenic bacteria\ngenomes.\nAlthough msDNAs have been isolated over the path-\nogenic Gram-negative bacteria, in this study we character-\nized a novel retron region by screening the complete genome\nsequence of Y ersinia frederiksenii [11] which encodes msr,\nmsd with a ret gene by best hits RT sequence similarity along\nwith V . cholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium.\nThese provide insight into the important roles of this mys-\nterious element in these bacteria species.\n2 Journal of Pathogens\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Genomic Analysis of Retron-Yf79.\n2.1.1. Sequence Retrieval. T o determine the particular place\nof retron-Yf79, the complete nucleotide genome sequence of\nY ersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 contig01029 was retrieved\nfrom the national center for biotechnology information\n(NCBI) resource at ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with the\nfollowing accession number (AALE02000035) [ 11]. T o inves-\ntigate an evolutionary relationship among amino acid se-\nquence of reverse transcriptases from Y. frede r iks e nii, V.\ncholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium; were col-\nlected from ExPASy proteomics server at ( http://www.expasy\n.org/). In addition, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA)\nnucleotide sequences of Y. frede r iks e nii, V . cholerae, V . para-\nhaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium were collected from the\nkyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) organism\ndatabase available at GenomeNet server, Japan ( http://www\n.genome.jp/) to observe the possible evolutionary scenario\namong those species.\n2.1.2. Sequence Alignment. The genomic organization of\nmsd-msr region of retron-Yf79 was determined according to\ntheir nucleotide sequences analyzing, that is, the presence\nof conserved region nucleotides with other msr-msd coding\nregions which have been isolated from various pathogenic\nbacteria- ( V . cholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimu-\nrium) by using (ClustalW) program available at ( http://www\n.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan [ 12]. T o evaluate the\nsimilarity of RT-Yf79 with others RT-Vc95 from V. c h o l e r a e\n[10], RT-Vp96 from V. p a r a h a e m o l y t i c u s(Shimamoto T,\n2003, unpublished data) and RT-St85 from S. Ty phimu-\nrium [ 5], the alignment program was utilized at the\nsite (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/)[ 12], after deter-\nmining the best hit of RTs sequence similarity search by\nthe BLAST program at NCBI Blast homepage ( http://www\n.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).\n2.1.3. Structure Prediction and Codon Bias Analysis. The\nDNA and RNA secondary structures of msDNA-Yf79 were\npredicted by using the database-( http://www.ncrna.org/\ncentroidfold/)[ 13]. The promoter sequence of retron-Yf79\nwas predicted on the basis of the conserved promoter\nsequences [ 14]. T o appraise whether the retron is a foreign\nDNA element, the codon bias was carried out. The codon\nbias of retron-Yf79 and the whole organism genome was\nresolute by using codon usage database-( http://www.kazusa\n.or.jp/codon)[ 15].\n2.1.4. Phylogenetic Analysis. T o evaluate the origin and\nsimilarity of RT-Yf79 from Y. frede r iks e nii, phylogenetic tree\nwas constructed by using other RTs from ( V. c h o l e r a e , V.\nparahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium). These amino acid\nsequences were aligned along with each other by using\n(ClustalW) at ( http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan\n[12]. The sequence alignment was performed under default\nconditions and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by\nthe neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic tree of\n16S ribosomal RNAs was also constructed based on their\nnucleotide sequences by using same database available at\n(http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan [ 12].\n3. Results\n3.1. The Structure of msDNA-Yf79. Analysis of msd nu-\ncleotide sequence showed that the DNA part of msDNA\nfound in Y. frede r iks e niiis predicted to consist of 79 bases of\na single-stranded DNA, and hence it was named as msDNA-\nYf79, and the RNA part of msDNA-Yf79 consists of 70\nbases encoded by msr gene of retron-Yf79 ( Figure 1(a) ).\nFurthermore, the guanine base (G) residue at position 12\nof the RNA molecule branched out by a unique 2\n′,5 ′-\nphosphodiester link ( Figure 1(a) ). The msDNAs isolated\nfrom other bacteria contains at least one mismatched base\npair in their DNA stems which could be mutagenic [ 16,\n17]. However, in this study we observed that the DNA\nstructure of msDNA-Yf79 contains no any mismatched base\npair as like as most of msDNAs were isolated from other\npathogenic bacteria ( Figure 1(a) ). Further, the msDNA-Yf79\nshared a number of conserved nucleotide sequences with\nother msDNAs (msDNA-St85,-Vc95 and -Vp96) ( Figure 1 ),\nexcept thymine (T) at position 67 in DNA part of msDNA-\nYf79 ( Figure 1(a) ).\n3.2. Genomic Organization of Retron-Yf79. The retron-Yf79\nconsists of nucleotide sequence of about 2.8 Kb, and the\nretron element is transcribed from the\n−35 and −10 con-\nserved promoter sequence located 5 bp upstream to the msr-\nmsd coding region (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). In addition, two\nopen reading frames (ORFs) were located just downstream\nof msr and msd coding sequence, one is RT-Yf79 encoded\nretron-type reverse transcriptase having 310 amino acids,\nand another one is ORF-541 which encoded a putative ATP\nbinding protein containing 541 amino acids ( Figure 2(a) ).\nThe upstream and downstream regions of retron element\nalso contained yfred0001\n42820 gene that encoded a hypo-\nthetical protein (356 AAs) and Yred0001 42860 gene that\nencoded a transposase (308 AAs), respectively ( Figure 2(a) ).\n3.3. Codon Usage of Retron-Yf79. T o identify the origin of\nRT-Yf79 and ORF-541 genes in Y. frede r iks e niigenome, the\ncodon usages were carried out. It revealed that the RT-Yf79\nand ORF-541 genes used AAA codon for lysine with a fre-\nquency of 55% and 74%, respectively, but the Y. frede r iks e nii\ngenome only used AAA codon for lysine with a frequency\nof 20% of the time (data not shown). Present observation\nsuggested that the retron-Yf79 is a foreign DNA element and\nprobably acquired in this organism chromosome from other\nancestral species during their evolution times.\n3.4. Comparative Study of RT-Yf79 with Other ret Genes\nfrom Di ﬀerent Pathogenic Bacteria. The RT-Yf79 encoded by\nthe retron-Yf79 consists of 310 AA residues. Surprisingly,\nall retron RTs in pathogenic bacteria were shown to have\nJournal of Pathogens 3\nA\nA-T•40\nC\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC\nT\nT-A\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T•50\nT-A•60\nT-A\nT-A\nA\nT-A\nC-G\nC-G\nC\nG\nG\nG-C\nU\nA-U\nA\nA\nC-G C-G\nC-G\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C•30\nG-C\nG-U\nU-A\nU\nUUU\nU\nU\nU\nUAU CUAACUUA\n10•\n∗C\n∗C\n∗C\n30•C-G\n20•T-A\n60\n•\n70\n•\n70∗∗G-C\n∗∗G-C\n∗∗C-G\n∗G\nG∗\n∗∗ ∗\n∗\n∗∗∗∗\nU∗\nU∗\n∗∗∗\n5\n5\n2\n10•∗U\n∗U\n∗U\n∗U\n•\n40•G-C•50\n20•A-U\nAATCATAAAAGTGCT-3-TAGAAGCC-\nACGA3\n∗A\nRNA\nmsDNA-Yf79\n(a)\nC\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G C-G•50\n40•C-G\nC-G\nC-G\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nT\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\n20•T-A\nA\nA\nA\nA\nG\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C G-C\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C•60\nG\nG\nUU\nU U\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU-A\nU-A\nU-A\nU U\nA-U\nG\n∗C•10\n30•A-T\nG-C•30\n20•U\nA-C•40\nG-C•50\n70•\n∗G\nG∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗∗\nU∗\n∗\n∗\n3\n352-\n∗A\nA\n∗C\n∗C\n5\n∗U\n∗U\n∗U\n∗U\nAACCCTAAAAGTACT-\n•80\n60\n•\n-TAGAGGAG\nCUAACUUAUUAU\n-UUCAUGA\n∗G-C∗\n∗G-C∗•70\n10•∗C-G∗\nRNA\nmsDNA-St85\n(b)\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G•60\nG\nG\nG\nG\nC\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C\nG-C•60\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T•70\nA\nA\nA\nA\nT\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA-U-G-G-A-C-U-A-C-A-C-A-U\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nA-U\nU-A\nA-U\nU-A\nU-A\nC-G\nC-G\n-TAGAGACA AACCCCAGTGTCGTTC-\n20•G-C\n•20\nG-C\nG-C\n∗∗\n30•C-G\n40•T\n•30\n40•U•G\nA-T•50\n50•U\n∗G\n∗∗∗∗ ∗∗\n∗∗\n∗\nU∗\nUU\n3\n3\n52-\n∗A\n∗C\n∗C\n∗C\nC\n-CAGCAAG\nU\n5\n∗U\n∗U•10\n∗U\n∗U\n•90\n∗G-C∗\n10•∗C-G∗\n∗G-C∗•80\nU\n∗\n•70\nA∗\nRNA\nmsDNA-Vc95\n(c)\n60•\n30•G-C•60\n40•GG •50\n∗∗∗∗ ∗∗\n∗∗\nU∗\nU\n∗∗\n3\n3\n∗G 52-\nG\n∗A\n∗C\n∗C•10\n∗C\n5\n∗U\n∗U\n∗U\n∗U\n•90∗G-C∗\n∗G-C∗\nA\n10•∗C-G\n∗\n•80\n20•G-C•70\n-TAGAGACA AACCCAATCCCGTTC-\n-GGGCAAG\nU\nU\nAA GG C\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nC-G\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nT-A\nC\nC\nG-C\nG-C\n30•G-C\nU•G\nG-C\nG-C\nT\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-T\nA-U\nA\nA\nA\n20•A\nC•50\nC\nC\nC\nU•40\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU-A\nU-A\nU-A\nG\nG\nG\nG•U∗\nA-U∗\nRNA\nmsDNA-Vp96\n(d)\nFigure 1: Possible secondary structures of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNAs) from pathogenic bacteria.

These four\nRTs shared approximately similar number of amino acids\n(Figure 3 ). In addition, they all shared a conserved domain\nalong with each other (data not shown).\n3.5. Phylogenetic Analysis of RTs and 16S Ribosomal RNA\nGene Sequences.

The phylogenetic tree analysis showed a\nfundamental diversity among the ret genes in relation to\nthe host bacteria ( Y. frede r iks e nii) species as RT-Yf79 from\nY. frede r iks e nii[11] was closely related to RT-Vp96 from V.\nparahaemolyticus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data)\nrather than to the RT-St85 from S.

Although\nboth RT-Vc95 and RT-Vp96 were from Vibrio species, both\nwere diverged from each other as they were closely related\nto RT-St85 and RT-Yf79, respectively ( Figure 4(a) ).

Discussion\nIn this study, we demonstrated that a new msDNA-Yf79 ex-\nists in Y. frede r iks e niiATCC 33641 contig01029 cell types and\ncompared it’s properties to that of St85 [ 5], Vc95 [ 10]a n d\nVp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data). The retron-\nYf79 was responsible for the production of msDNA-Yf79 in\nY. frede r iks e niiGram-negative pathogenic bacteria strain.\nHowever, the gene organization of retron-Yf79 was\nsimilar to those found in E. coli (retron-Ec83 and -Ec78) [ 8,\n9], that is, contained only two open reading frames (ORFs)\nin their retroelement. On the other hand, the gene organi-\nzation of retron-Vc95 [ 10] and retron-Vp96 (Shimamoto T,\n2003, unpublished data) were completely di ﬀerent as they\ncontained a third ORFs. The msDNA-Yf79 has a sequence\nsimilarity to msDNA-St85, msDNA-Vc95 and msDNA-Vp96\nas these msDNAs shared a number of highly conserved bases\nin their nucleotide sequences, indicating that they might be\ndescended from a common origin (i.e., from a common\nancestor). The presence of the conserved guanine base (G)\nat position 12 in RNA part of msDNA-Yf79 which involved\nin branch formation via a 2\n′,5 ′-phosphodiater link in DNA-\nRNA complex ( Figure 1(a) ). Lima and Lim suggested that the\nfact that the mutation in guanine base (G) prevents msDNA\nsynthesis and the primary product of reverse transcription\nmay be a branched DNA-RNA compounds [ 9], which\nsupports our observation.\nFurthermore, it was quite interesting that stem structure\nof msDNA-Yf79 did not contained any mismatched base\npair like most of the msDNA isolated from other pathogenic\nbacteria. Moreover, the codon usage of this retron element\nand also the phylogenetic analysis of RTs and 16S rRNA from\npathogenic bacteria revealed that this retron was a foreign\nDNA element. The downstream of retron element-Yf79\ncontained a transposase gene indicating that this enzyme\nmight be participated in transposition of this novel retron\nelement in the genome.\nJournal of Pathogens 5\n----- M K IEI PYQ DIG IS R N KL AF TAR RS P L KYKVYKI PKRS S G -V RVIA QPT P EV KDLQ\n----M N LV KRL AHHL GKS EP EV I H FLA DAP NKYRVYKI PKRS YG- HRVIA QPTRELKL YQ\nMDIL QHI S DL L L T K---- KS EI I S F S L TAP YRYKI YKI AKRNS DKKRT IA HPSKELK F IQ\nMNIL TT L RE QLLT NNVI MPQEFE RLE VRGSH AYKVY S IP K RKAG- RR T IA HPS SK LK I CQ\n. .. ................... .... . .. . . ... . .... ..  \nRKLVE F L RTQL TVHS S ATAY EP GKGIR E N AQQHVNNP YLLKM D FS NF F NS I T PET F KNAL\nKAF LE LY S --F PV H SSATAY CKGKS I KDNALS HVKNHY L L KTDL EN FFN SI TP NIF WKS I\nRE I TE YLT DKLPV HEC AF AY KKGS SI K TNAQVHL HTKYL L KM DF ENF FP SI T P RLF FSK L\nRH LNAI L NP LL KVHDS SY AY VKGRS I KDNA L VHS HSA YVLKM D FQNF F NS I T PTI LR QCL\n..... .. .. ....  . .. .. . .... . . .. .  .. . .\nL HDSVEI DE HT - - -LI LL IS I F FWCP GKKLS G K LV LSV G A PSSPF IS N Y V MKKFD QLLSE\nE NDS I ATPKF S TS E I ALV ERLI FW RPS K LQ GG K LV LSV G A PSSPTIS N F CLY QFD EY LS I \nRLAN ID L TA D D ---K VL L E NI L F F KS- - KRNSN L RLSI G A PSSPLI SN FV M Y F WDIE VQE\nIQ NDI L LS V N E --- L EK LEQ LI FW NPSKKRN G KLI LSV G S P I SPLI SN AIM YP FD KII ND\n........ ........ .......... . . . . . .... .  ....\nIC HQAGVTYTRYAD D M TFS TQHE NVL F TLKE QI PT LI V QSG Y ENI S IN E SK T V FSSK A H N\nIC KEQNI S YTRYAD D LTFS T CDKDVL HTVIP LI QS LL DY FFA SE LK LN H SK T V FSSK A H N\nIC S KI GVNYTRYADDL TF S TN NKDVL FDIP D M L ENVL PKYSL GRI RI NH E K T V FSSK G H N\nIC TKHGI NYTRYADDI TF S TN I KNTL NKLPEI V E QLI I Q TYAGRI I IN KRK T V FSSKKHN\n. ... . . . . ........ .... ....... .. .\nRH VTGVTLTN DDKL S VGRKNKRY ASSLI F RF KL GE L SA DETLMLK G LLAHY F YIE P V FKL  \nRH VTGI TL NNEGKL S L GRERKRYI KHLV HS F KYGKL DNTEI RHLQGM LS FA KHIE P IF I D \nRH VTGI TLTN DNKL S I GRERKR KIS AMI HHFI NGKLST DECNKL VGL L AF AKNI E PS F YK\nRH VTGI TLTN DS KI S I GR S RKRYI S S LV F KYI NKNL DI DE I NHM KGM L AF AYNI E P I Y I H\n. . . . . .. ..... . .. ...  . ..... . ..... ....\nS MQKKYG A EI I NGIV K YQ E -\nR L KE KY TD ELI KI I YE AGHE -313\n-310\n-311\n-315\nS MVI KYG S DNI Y KL QKQK DK\nR L S HK YKVN IV E KI L RG SN —\n. . . ... ..... .\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1Consensus\nConsensus\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\nConsensus\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\nConsensus\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\nConsensus\nRT-Yf79\nRT-Vp96\nRT-St85\nRT-Vc95\nConsensus\n55\n56\n57\n60\n61\n115\n114\n117\n120\n121\n172\n174\n172\n177\n181\n232\n234\n232\n237\n241\n292\n294\n292\n297\n301\n∗∗∗\n∗∗\n∗∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗\n∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗ ∗∗ ∗ ∗ ∗∗\n∗∗\n∗∗\n∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ ∗ ∗∗∗∗∗ ∗\n∗∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗∗∗\n∗∗∗∗ ∗\nFigure 3: Comparison of the amino acids sequence alignment of the RT-Yf79 with the three highest identity RT sequences: RT-Vc95 (44%\nidentity), RT-Vp96 (45% identity), and RT-St85 (43% identity).

They enable the spread of a large pool of genetic information\nvia lateral gene transfer. Many bacterial strains contain mega-sized replicons and these are particularly common in\nAlphaproteobacteria. Considerably less is known about smaller alphaproteobacterial plasmids. We analyzed the\ngenomes of 14 such plasmids residing in 4 multireplicon carotenoid-producing strains of the genus Paracoccus\n(Alphaproteobacteria): P. aestuarii  DSM 19484, P. haeundaensis  LG P-21903, P. marcusii  DSM 11574 and P.\nmarcusii OS22. Comparative analyses revealed mosaic structures of the plasmids and recombinational shuffling of\ndiverse genetic modules involved in (i) plasmid replication, (ii) stabilization (including toxin-antitoxin systems of the\nrelBE/parDE, tad-ata, higBA, mazEF and toxBA families) and (iii) mobilization for conjugal transfer (encoding\nrelaxases of the Mob Q, MobP or MobV families). A common feature of the majority of the plasmids is the presence of\nAT-rich sequence islets (located downstream of exc1-like genes) containing genes, whose homologs are conserved\nin the chromosomes of many bacteria (encoding e.g. RelA/SpoT, SMC-like proteins and a retron-type reverse\ntranscriptase). The results of this study have provided insight into the diversity and plasticity of plasmids of\nParacoccus spp., and of the entire Alphaproteobacteria. Some of the identified plasmids contain replication systems\nnot described previously in this class of bacteria. The composition of the plasmid genomes revealed frequent transfer\nof chromosomal genes into plasmids, which significantly enriches the pool of mobile DNA that can participate in\nlateral transfer. Many strains of Paracoccus spp. have great biotechnological potential, and the plasmid vectors\nconstructed in this study will facilitate genetic studies of these bacteria.\nCitation: Maj A, Dziewit L, Czarnecki J, Wlodarczyk M, Baj J, et al.

Besides the conserved backbone, composed of\ngenetic modules encoding replication (REP), stabilization and\ntransfer functions, plasmids can contain an additional “genetic\nload”, which may significantly influence the metabolic\nproperties of any recipient strain. Many plasmids are giant\nmolecules that can even exceed the size of some bacterial\nchromosomes. Such mega-sized replicons (megaplasmids) are\nparticularly common in Alphaproteobacteria.\nAlphaproteobacteria constitute interesting models for\nstudying the complexity and diversity of bacterial genomes.\nMany strains within the genera Rhizobium, Agrobacterium and\nParacoccus contain chromosomes, chromids, megaplasmids\nand sometimes several smaller plasmids (e.g. [ 1,2]). Analysis\nof the genomic data collected by The National Center for\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) revealed that the sequenced\ngenomes of 240 alphaproteobacterial strains include a total of\n315 plasmids. Twenty six of these strains are multi-plasmid\ncontaining, with at least five extrachromosomal replicons.\nFor many years, knowledge of plasmids of the\nAlphaproteobacteria was mainly limited to the repABC and\nrepC families of replicons, which are specific for megaplasmids\nof this group of bacteria ( repA and repB  of repABC replicons\nencode partitioning proteins, while repC encodes replication\ninitiator) (e.g. [ 3,4]). Recent studies have revealed the\npresence of plasmids classified into the repA and repB families\nas well as a dnaA-like family, encoding replication proteins with\nsimilarity to the DnaA proteins involved in the initiation of\nreplication of bacterial chromosomes [ 1]. Detailed analysis of\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\nthe REP regions allowed the following incompatibility (inc)\ngroups to be distinguished: (i) 9 groups of repABC replicons,\n(ii) 5 groups of repA-family replicons and (iii) 4 groups of repB-\nfamily replicons [ 1]. Most of the analyzed REPs are harbored\nby megaplasmids and much less is known about smaller\nalphaproteobacterial plasmids.\nSeveral years ago we initiated a project aimed at identifying\nand characterizing the pool of mobile DNA in bacteria\nbelonging to the genus Paracoccus (Alphaproteobacteria). This\ngenus currently comprises 42 species and hundreds of strains\n(not identified at species level), which are known for their\nversatile physiological properties and ability to perform a\nnumber of different growth modes. We focused our interest on\nmobile genetic elements (MGE) of Paracoccus spp., especially\nplasmids and transposable elements (TE) (e.g. [ 5]). As a result\nof this approach we have identified and analyzed (i) four\nrelated repABC as well as several pTAV3-type megaplasmids\n– both groups residing in P. versutus UW1 and four strains of\nParacoccus pantotrophus  [6,7], (ii) plasmid pALC1 of\nParacoccus alcaliphilus  JCM 7364, with an iteron-containing\nreplication system [ 8], (iii) plasmid pMTH1 of Paracoccus\nmethylutens DM12, whose genome is predominantly (80%)\ncomposed of transposable modules (TMos) [ 9], (iv) three\nplasmids of Paracoccus aminophilus  JCM 7686, whose REP\nmodules were used for the construction of versatile DIY\ncassettes [ 10,11], as well as (v) plasmid pWKS1 of P.\npantotrophus DSM 11072 – the smallest replicon identified so\nfar in Paracoccus spp. [12].\nIn this study we identified four plasmid-rich strains of\nParacoccus spp. Genomic analysis of their plasmids revealed\nthat the genetic organization and structure of many of them\ndiffer significantly from that previously described in\nAlphaproteobacteria.\nResults and Discussion\nPlasmids of carotenoid-producing strains of\nParacoccus spp.\nAt the initial stage of this study we analyzed the plasmid\ncontent of 22 strains representing 20 Paracoccus spp. (listed in\nMethods section). Plasmid screening revealed that the majority\nof the tested strains contained megaplasmids (above 100 kb)\n(data not shown). Only four of the strains ( P. aestuarii  DSM\n19484, P. haeundaensis LG P-21903, P. marcusii DSM 11574\nand P. marcusii  OS22 – all able to produce beta-carotenoid\npigments) contained numerous smaller replicons ranging in\nsize from approx. 2.5 kb to 85 kb.\nTo analyze plasmid diversity in these strains we obtained the\nnucleotide sequences of 14 randomly selected replicons (listed\nin Table 1): (i) 5 pAES plasmids of P. aestuarii DSM 19484, (ii)\n2 pHAE plasmids of P. haeundaensis  LMG P-21903, (iii) 4\npMARC plasmids of P. marcusii DSM 11574 and (iv) 3 pMOS\nplasmids of P. marcusii OS22.\nThe results of the overall characterization of the plasmids are\npresented in Table 1. A summary of the distinguished open\nreading frames (ORFs), including their position, the size of the\nputative proteins they encode and their closest homologs, is\npresented in Table S1 in the supplemental material.\nComparative bioinformatic analysis was used to distinguish\nthe plasmid backbones, composed of different combinations of\ngenetic modules responsible for plasmid replication (REP),\nstabilization (toxin-antitoxin – TA; partitioning – PAR) and\nmobilization for conjugal transfer (MOB), and accessory\ngenetic information, which may potentially influence the\nphenotype of the host (Figure 1). Detailed characterization of\nthe predicted modules is presented below.\nReplication modules\nReplication systems of the vast majority of plasmids residing\nin gram-negative bacteria consist of two elements: (i) a gene\nencoding a Rep protein, which initiates DNA replication, and (ii)\nthe cis-required origin ( oriV; equivalent to chromosomal oriC)\nwhere replication begins. Most Rep proteins are highly\nconserved and they can be grouped into several families on the\nbasis of amino acid (aa) sequence similarities. In contrast,\noriVs are more divergent and they are usually placed in close\nproximity to the rep genes. In many cases, the location of the\noriVs can be predicted in silico by the presence of (i) directly\nrepeated sequences (including iterons), which constitute the\nRep protein binding sites (iterons, being key elements in the\ncontrol of replication initiation, determine plasmid\nincompatibility [ 13]), (ii) A+T-rich DNA regions, where strand\nopening and assembly of host replication initiation factors\nTable 1.

Based on aa sequence similarities of the\npredicted Rep proteins, the presence of conserved motifs and\nthe oriV structures, the REP modules could be classified into\nfour groups, some representing novel replication system types.\nThe genetic structure of these REP modules is illustrated in\nFigure 2 and the nucleotide sequences of the predicted oriVs\nare presented in Additional file 2: Figure S1.\nFigure 1.

Shaded areas connect genes of plasmids that encode orthologous proteins.

[ 15]. Comparative\nanalysis of the sequences and structures of these modules\nidentified three distinct subgroups, present in the following\nplasmids: (i) pAES2, pAES3, pHAE1, pMARC4, (ii) pMARC1,\npMOS7 and (iii) pHAE2.\npAES2, pAES3, pHAE1 and pMARC4.  The Rep proteins of\nthe first subgroup show aa sequence identity ranging from 54\nto 81% (highest identity observed between Reps of pHAE1 and\npAES2). Database searches revealed that related proteins are\ncommonly encoded by alphaproteobacterial plasmids. The best\nBLAST hits were obtained for replication initiator proteins of\nsmall plasmids: pMG160 of Rhodobacter blasticus (accession\nno NP_775696) [ 16] (70-78% aa sequence identity) and\npWKS1 of Paracoccus pantotrophus  DSM 11072 (accession\nno NP_775696) [12] (66-72% identity).\nThe predicted oriVs of pAES2, pAES3, pHAE1 and pMARC4\nwere identified upstream of the rep genes (Figure 2). These\nhighly conserved regions contain (i) three long iteron-like\ndirectly repeated sequences (DR1-DR3) of 19 bp, separated\none from another by 2 bp spacers, and (ii) a single inverted\npartial iteron situated adjacent to the start codon of the rep\ngene (see Figure S1 in the supplemental material). As shown\nin Figure 2, the iterons of the analyzed plasmids are not\nidentical, which suggests that these replicons belong to\ndifferent inc groups. The highest level of sequence identity was\nobserved between DRs of plasmids pHAE1 and pAES2, while\nDRs of pMARC4 were most divergent (Figure 2). A common\nFigure 2.

Within the oriV-containing region of\npMARC4 we also identified a palindromic sequence (5'-\nAGCCTTGCAAGGCT-3'), located upstream of the identified\niterons.\npMARC1 and pMOS7.   Both REP modules are highly\nrelated and their Rep proteins share 96% aa sequence identity.\nHomologous replication initiator proteins are encoded by many\nplasmids residing in strains classified within the Beta- and\nGammaproteobacteria. The highest level of identity (46%) was\nwith the Rep of the small plasmid pHLHK19 of Laribacter\nhongkongensis HLHK19 ( Betaproteobacteria) (accession no\nABC70160).\nThe predicted oriVs of pMOS7 and pMARC1 are placed\nupstream of the rep genes and in order they contain (i) three\nputative 16-bp iterons (DR1-DR3) separated by spacer\nsequences of 5 bp (Figure 2), (ii) a putative DnaA-box situated\n2 bp downstream of DR3 (5’-TcATCCACA-3’ in pMARC1 and\n5’-TTATCCACA-3’ in pMOS7; nucleotide not matching the\nconsensus DnaA box, 5'-TTT/ATNCACA-3' [ 17], shown in\nlowercase), and (iii) 27-bp-long IR sequences (separated by 14\nbp), which cover the predicted promoter, ribosome binding site\n(rbs) and ATG start codon of the rep gene (Figure S1).\npHAE2.  Plasmid pHAE2 also contains an iteron-type oriV,\ncomposed of (i) five 19-bp repeats (DR1-DR5), separated by\nspacer sequences of 3 bp, and (ii) identical IRs of 16 bp\n(separated by 22 bp), which precede the predicted iterons\n(Figure 2 and Figure S1). A BLAST search with the amino acid\nsequence of the pHAE2 Rep protein identified only two proteins\nwith significant sequence similarity, encoded by Sphingobium\nyanoikuyae XLDN2-5 (accession no ZP_09907537) (60% aa\nsequence identity) and Citreicella sp. 357 (accession no\nZP_10022073) (62% aa sequence identity) – both strains\nbelonging to the Alphaproteobacteria. Weak homology to\nreplication proteins of several Acinetobacter spp. plasmids\n(Gammaproteobacteria) was also observed.\nREP modules of pAES1, pAES7, pMARC3 and pMOS2\nAnother group of REP modules (present in plasmids pAES1,\npAES7, pMARC3 and pMOS2) encode replication initiation\nproteins containing predicted helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains\n(HTH_36) conserved in many transcription regulators (PFAM:\n13730). Based on aa sequence comparisons, these REP\nmodules were divided into two subclasses comprising (i)\npAES7, pMARC3, pMOS2, and (ii) pAES1.\npAES7, pMARC3 and pMOS2.   The Rep proteins of these\nthree plasmids have aa sequence identities ranging from 57 to\n62%. Homologous proteins are commonly encoded by many\nalphaproteobacterial strains, e.g. Sphingobium xenophagum\nQYY (accession no YP_195758), Acetobacter pomorum\nDM001 (accession no ZP_08242880) and Acidiphilium cryptum\nJF-5 (accession no YP_001220371) (approx. 60% aa\nsequence identity).\nThese plasmids possess oriVs with different structures\n(Figure 2). However, all contain 2 iteron-like DRs (of 39 bp in\npAES7, 18 bp in pMARC3 and 19 bp in pMOS2). The DRs of\npMOS2 are overlapped by IRs of 14 bp (Figure S1 ).\nInterestingly, within the pAES7 oriV, an incomplete inverted\niteron (14 bp) was identified, partially overlapping the start\ncodon of the rep gene, which is analogous to the location of the\npartial iterons observed within the oriVs of pAES2, pAES3,\npHAE1 and pMARC4.\npAES1.  The REP module of pAES1 is unique among\nAlphaproteobacteria, although related replication systems are\ncommon in enteric bacteria ( Gammaproteobacteria). The\npAES1-encoded Rep protein (Rep pAES1) shows highest aa\nsequence identity (46%) to the protein encoded by plasmid\npKL1 of Escherichia coli  KL4 (accession no NP_053155)\n(Gammaproteobacteria). The oriV of pKL1 is placed upstream\nof the rep gene and contains an IHF-box and several Rep\nbinding sites [ 18]. The oriV-containing regions of pKL1 and\npAES1 do not show significant nucleotide sequence similarity,\nbut they contain analogously placed IR sequences: 16-bp long\nin pKL1 (perfectly matching repeats) and 28-bp long in pAES1\n(5 mismatches) (Figure S1).\nWithin the left and right IR of pAES1, two shorter (15 bp)\ndirectly repeated sequences were identified (DR1 and DR2),\nand a third copy of this repeat was detected elsewhere (DR3,\nlocated 70 bp downstream of DR2) (Figure 2 and Figure S1).\nREP modules of plasmids pAES4 and pMARC2\nThe highly homologous REP modules of pAES4 and\npMARC2 do not possess iteron-like DRs. Upstream of the rep\ngenes they contain only long inverted repeats, covering the\npredicted rep promoters (Figure 2 and Figure S1). The IRs of\npAES4 form a long (46 bp) imperfect (3 mismatches)\npalindromic sequence, while those of pMARC2 (18 bp) are\nidentical and are separated by a 4-bp spacer sequence ( Figure\nS1).\nThe Rep proteins of these plasmids show 92% aa sequence\nidentity. Both contain a predicted HTH motif typical of\ntranscriptional regulators of the MarR family. Homologous Rep\nproteins are not common in other bacteria. Only four proteins\nwith significant aa sequence identity (47-55%) (annotated as\nhypothetical proteins) were identified in the NCBI databases –\nall from strains belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria. These\nare encoded by (i-ii) plasmids pACMV6 and pACMV8 of\nAcidiphilium multivorum  AIU301 (accession nos\nYP_004277313 and YP_004277317, respectively), (iii) plasmid\npAPA01-060 of Acetobacter pasteurianus  IFO 3283-01\n(accession no YP_003189587) and (iv) Rhodospirillum\nphotometricum DSM 122 (sequence contig; accession no\nYP_005418451). All the aforementioned proteins are annotated\nas hypothetical proteins and they do not show sequence\nsimilarity to any other plasmid encoded Rep proteins.\nTherefore, the results of the comparative analysis strongly\nsuggest that the Rep proteins of pAES4 and pMARC2 may be\nconsidered as the archetypes of a novel group of plasmid\nreplication initiators.\nREP module of pMOS6\nThe REP module of pMOS6 encodes a predicted Rep\nprotein (Rep pMOS6), which is related to proteins encoded by\nstrains belonging to the Alpha-, Beta- and\nGammaproteobacteria as well as the CFB group of bacteria\n(genus Bacteroides). The majority of these proteins are\nPlasmids of Carotenoid-Producing Paracoccus spp.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\nannotated as conserved hypothetical proteins of unknown\nfunction. However, more detailed analysis revealed that all of\nthem contain domains conserved in the plasmid replication\nproteins of the RepL family from Firmicutes (PFAM: PF05732).\nClosely related Rep protein sequences were identified within a\nfew plasmids, i.e. pTINT02 of Thiomonas intermedia K12, pML\nof Bartonella schoenbuchensis  m07a (accession no\nENN90461) and pPsv48C of Pseudomonas savastanoi , and\nsome chromosomes, e.g. Bartonella vinsonii  (accession no\nYP_007462201). Interestingly, besides ReppMOS6 homologs, the\nthree aforementioned plasmids encode other proteins that may\nbe involved in replication initiation (RepC in pML and a\nreplication protein with a primase domain in pTINT02 and\npPsv48C). Plasmid pMOS6 encodes only a single Rep protein,\nwhich is sufficient for initiation of replication, as proved by the\nconstruction of a pMOS6 minimal replicon (data not shown).\nThe oriV-containing region of pMOS6, identified upstream of\nthe rep gene, contains a sequence (5’-gAACcTCTGTCTTG-3’)\nwith similarity to the IHF-box distinguished in Paracoccus\nmethylutens DM12 plasmid pMTH4 [ 19] and two identical 18-\nbp iteron-like repeated sequences, separated by 3 bp ( Figure 2\nand Figure S1).\nToxin-antitoxin modules\nToxin-antitoxin modules confer plasmid stabilization in a\npopulation by eliminating plasmid-less cells at the post\nsegregational level. Such genetic modules are composed of\ntwo elements: (i) a toxin protein that binds a specific cellular\ntarget and (ii) an antitoxin (protein or antisense RNA), which\ncounteracts the toxin. BLAST searches revealed that seven of\nthe analyzed plasmids (pAES4, pAES7, pMARC1, pMARC3,\npMARC4, pMOS6 and pMOS7) contain putative toxin-antitoxin\nmodules representing five TA groups: (i) relBE/parDE, (ii) tad-\nata, (iii) higBA, (iv) mazEF and (v) toxBA.\nPlasmids pAES3 and pAES7 ( P. aestuarii  DSM 19484)\ncontain highly related TA modules (94% nucleotide sequence\nidentity) of the RelBE/parDE superfamily [20], composed of two\nshort overlapping ORFs (4 bp overlap). The first ORFs of the\npredicted operons ( orf6 of pAES3 and orf3 of pAES7) encode\nputative proteins with significant similarity to a number of\nplasmid-encoded antitoxins, classified within a large family of\ntranscriptional regulators containing a CopG/Arc/MetJ DNA-\nbinding domain (cluster of orthologous groups COG3609). The\nhighest similarity was to the TA module antitoxin of plasmid\npAMI3 of Paracoccus aminophilus JCM 7686 [10] (78 and 79%\naa sequence identity, respectively). The downstream ORFs\n(orf5 of pAES3 and orf4 of pAES7) encode putative proteins\nwith substantial homology to toxins of the ParE family\n(COG3668), with the highest similarity to the toxin of the\naforementioned pAMI3 TA module [ 10] (72 and 75% aa\nsequence identity, respectively).\nInterestingly, plasmid pAES7 also carries another TA module\n(orf14-orf15) representing the tad-ata group, whose archetype\nwas identified in plasmid pAMI2 of Paracoccus aminophilus\nJCM 7686 [21]. A related module is also present within plasmid\npMOS6 of P. marcusii OS22 (orf11-orf12) (Figure 1). The Tad-\nrelated toxins are encoded by the first genes of the predicted\nTA operons. They belong to a large family of proteins\n(COG4679), exhibiting significant sequence similarity to the\nRelE toxins ( relBE-type TA modules), which act as mRNA-\ncleaving RNAses [ 22]. Comparative sequence analysis of the\nantitoxins of pAES7 and pMOS6 (encoded downstream of the\ntad-homologs) revealed that these proteins belong to\nCOG5606 and COG1396, respectively, and they contain a\nHTH motif typical of the Xre/Cro family.\nAn analogous genetic organization (toxin gene upstream of\nthe antitoxin gene) was also observed in the TA system of\npAES4 ( P. aestuarii  DSM 19484), classified within the higBA\nfamily [ 23]. This TA module is composed of two ORFs ( orf8\nand orf9), separated by a 10-bp intergenic region, encoding\nproteins with the highest level of aa identity to the killer\nchromosomal protein of Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009\n(accession no NP_947628) (68%) and the antitoxin of the Xre\nfamily encoded by another strain of R. palustris  – BisB18\n(accession no YP_534586) (70%), respectively.\nPlasmid pMARC4 of P. marcusii  DSM 11574 carries two\noverlapping (4 bp) ORFs: orf3 and orf4. The latter encodes a\npredicted toxin with substantial similarity (63% aa sequence\nidentity) to the PemK-like protein of Chlorobium\nphaeobacteroides BS1 ( mazEF family of TA systems).\nInterestingly, the orf3-encoded protein displays 65% identity to\na hypothetical protein of plasmid pDSHI01 of Dinoroseobacter\nshibae DFL 12, and is quite different from typical MazE-type\nantitoxins. BLAST searches revealed that gene pairs\nhomologous to orf3-orf4 are conserved in many bacterial\ngenomes (mainly in plasmids). Our analysis suggests that the\nTA hybrid module of pMARC4 might be considered the\nprototype of a new subgroup within the MazEF TA family.\nPlasmids pMARC1, pMARC3 ( P. marcusii DSM 11574) and\npMOS7 ( P. marcusii  OS22) contain related pairs of genes\n(orf5-orf6, orf8-orf9, orf6-orf7, respectively), which represent a\nnovel group of TA modules, that we designate the toxAB family\n(Figure 1). Homologous loci were distinguished by Leplae et al.\n[24], but none of them were analyzed at the molecular level.\nThe first genes of the predicted TA operons encode DUF497\nproteins (predicted toxin; ToxB), while the genes in the second\nposition were classified into the COG3680 (pMOS7 and\npMARC1) or COG3514 (pMARC3) orthologous groups\n(putative antitoxins; ToxA). The predicted secondary structure\nof the COG3680 and COG3514 antitoxins is highly conserved.\nProteins of both groups contain, in their C-terminal regions, a\nRHH_1 domain related to a domain of the CcdA antitoxin of the\nccdAB TA system [ 25]. The most closely related TA module\nwas identified within Desulfomicrobium baculatum  DSM 4028\n(accession nos YP_003157266 and YP_003157267).\nRestriction-modification module\nOne of the analyzed plasmids (pAES2 of P. aestuarii  DSM\n19484) contains a putative type II restriction-modification (R-M)\nsystem (Figure 1). Similarly to TA, such systems may increase\nthe stability of plasmids by killing plasmid-less cells [ 26]. The\nRM module of pAES2 is composed of overlapping orf3 and orf4\n(1-bp overlap). The orf3 protein shares substantial similarity\nwith a large number of proteins annotated as m5C\nmethyltransferases (MTases) (PFAM: PF00145). The predicted\npAES2 MTase contains six (I, IV, VI, VIII, IX and X) of the ten\nPlasmids of Carotenoid-Producing Paracoccus spp.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\namino acid sequence motifs (placed in conserved order)\ncharacteristic of m5C MTases, including an invariant Pro-Cys\ndipeptide in the catalytic motif IV [ 27] (data not shown). The\norf4-encoded protein is similar to restriction endonuclease\nNgoMIV, which recognizes the sequence 5’-GCCGGC-3’. The\nmost closely related R-M module was identified in plasmid\npAOVO02 of Acidovorax sp. JS42 (accession nos YP_974088\nand YP_974088) with 89% and 93% aa sequence identity of\nthe MTases and endonucleases, respectively.\nPartitioning module\nPartitioning systems (PAR), which allow proper segregation\nof plasmid copies upon cell division, are components of the\nvast majority of large low copy number plasmids. Only one of\nthe plasmids analyzed in this study (pMARC3 of P. marcusii\nDSM 11574; 10,672 bp) contains a predicted PAR module of\ntypical structure, composed of two par genes ( orf2 and orf3)\nand a centromere-like partitioning site (Figure 1).\nBLAST searches revealed that the deduced aa sequence of\nOrf2 is similar over its entire length to a large number of\npartitioning ATPases (ParA), with highest identity (44%) to the\nputative ParA protein of plasmid pMRAD03 of the\nalphaproteobacterium Methylobacterium radiotolerans  JCM\n2831 (accession no YP_001776801).\nDetailed analysis of Orf2/ParA revealed the presence of a\nsequence motif [KGGSGKS] matching the canonical sequence\n[KGG(T/N/V)GKT] of a deviant Walker A motif, which is\ncharacteristic for ATPases of type I partitioning modules [ 28].\nThe orf3-encoded polypeptide of pMARC3 (putative ParB)\ndisplays only slight homology to a hypothetical protein of\nBacillus sp. 2_A_57_CT2 (accession no ZP_08007698) (30%\naa sequence identity), whose gene (as in pMARC3) is\nassociated with that encoding a partitioning ATPase.\nThe putative centromere-like site (parS) of the pMARC3 PAR\nmodule is located within the promoter region of parA, which\nconsists of three non-identical 13-bp-long repeated sequences.\nTaking into account its structure (i.e. the presence of a small\nparB gene and the location of the parS site) and the results of\ndetailed comparative analyses, the predicted PAR module of\npMARC3 was classified into the Ib group of partitioning\nsystems [28].\nModules for mobilization for conjugal transfer\nMany plasmids are capable of horizontal transfer by\nconjugation. According to their transfer ability, they may be\ngrouped into two categories comprising self-transmissible and\nmobilizable replicons. The latter grouping contains MOB DNA\nregions, which carry genetic information essential for the\nprocessing of conjugative DNA. The MOBs are usually\ncomposed of two elements: an origin of transfer ( oriT) and a\ngene coding for relaxase, which nicks DNA at the oriT sites.\nThe transfer of mobilizable plasmids requires a membrane-\nassociated mating pair formation complex, which may be\nprovided by self-transmissible plasmids or integrative and\nconjugative elements (ICE) co-residing in the cell [29].\nNone of the 14 Paracoccus spp. plasmids was a self-\ntransmissible replicon, but nine of them contained predicted\nMOB modules (Figure 1). Based on comparative analysis of\nthe relaxase aa sequences, these proteins (and the MOB\nmodules encoding them) were classified within the Mob Q, MobP\nor MobV families [30].\nMOBQ modules.  The MOB Q family constitutes a diverse\ngroup, comprising several subgroups (clades) [ 30]. The MOBs\nof paracoccal plasmids represent the MOB Q1 (pHAE1) and\nMOBQ3 (pAES7, pMARC3 and pMOS6) clades. The overall\ngenetic organization of the MOB modules and the conserved\nsequence motifs of their relaxases are shown in Figure S2 in\nthe supplemental material.\nBLAST searches revealed that plasmid pHAE1 ( P.\nhaeundensis LMG P-21903) encodes a protein with 34% aa\nsequence identity to the MobA relaxase of a broad-host-range\n(BHR) plasmid RSF1010 – the archetype of the MOBQ family. A\nputative origin of transfer was identified upstream of the pHAE1\nmobA gene (5’-AAAtaCATAAGTGCGCCCTCCC-3’), showing\nsimilarity to the MOB Q family oriT consensus sequence (5’-\nNWACCNNTAAGTGCGCCCTYNN-3’) [31] (residues matching\nthe consensus are shown in uppercase). Closely related MOB\nmodules are encoded by several mobilizable plasmids,\nincluding pAB6 of Neisseria meningitidis , pP of Salmonella\nenteritidis and ColE2-P9 of E. coli [31].\nThe MOBs of pMARC3 ( P. marcusii  DSM 11574) and\npMOS6 ( P. marcusii  OS22) (MOB Q3 clade; Additional file 3:\nFigure S2) are composed of two non-overlaping ORFs\nencoding, respectively, MobA relaxase and mobilization protein\nC (MobC), while the MOB of pAES7 is defective (it carries a\ntruncated mobA gene, lacking its proximal part). The pMARC3\nand pMOS6 relaxases exhibit the highest aa sequence identity\n(86%) to the MobA protein encoded by plasmid pAMI3 of\nParacoccus aminophilus JCM 7686 [10]. The predicted oriTs of\npMARC3 and pMOS6 were identified between divergently\noriented mobA and mobC genes. These sequences are nearly\nidentical (5’-ATAAGTGGGCACTTCGTGTCTTGCACCCTAt/\nc-3’; non-conserved nucleotides are shown in lowercase) and\nthey show significant similarity to the putative oriT of pAMI3\n[10]. Plasmid pAES7 does not contain related sequences.\nMOBP modules.  Two of the analyzed plasmids, pMARC2\n(P. marcusii  DSM 11574) and pAES4 ( P. aestuarii  DSM\n19484), encode relaxases of the MOB P family, classified within\nthe MOB P5(MOBHEN) clade (Figure S2). MOB P encodes the\nlargest group of relaxases, which are closely related to those of\nthe MOB Q family. The prototype of the MOB P5(MOBHEN)\nrelaxases is protein MbeA of plasmid ColE1 [30].\nThe MOB modules of pMARC2 and pAES4 are composed of\nthree overlapping and convergently oriented ORFs: mobA\n(encoding the relaxase), mobB and mobC (Figure 1). The\npredicted MobA, MobB and MobC polypeptides exhibit\nsignificant similarity to the corresponding proteins encoded by\nplasmid pAsal2 (MOB P5 family) of Aeromonas salmonicida\nsubsp. salmonicida [30]. The predicted oriT sequences of\npMARC2 and pAES4 are placed upstream of the mobC gene\nand are highly conserved – they differ in only 3 nucleotides (5’-\nGGGGGATTGAAGGGGGCCAa/ca/ta/\ngGCCCCCTCACAAGC-3’; non-conserved nucleotides are\nshown in lowercase). A homologous DNA region (80% identity)\nis also conserved in plasmid pAsal2 (accession no AJ508383;\nnt position 590-621).\nPlasmids of Carotenoid-Producing Paracoccus spp.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\nMOBV modules.  Plasmids pMARC4 ( P. marcusii  DSM\n11574), pMOS2 ( P. marcusii  OS22) and pAES1 ( P. aestuarii\nDSM 19484) encode relaxases that are members of the MOB V\nfamily (MOB V2 clade) (Figure S2). Most of the plasmids\nencoding MOB V relaxases were identified in Firmicutes and\nBacteroidetes, with the exception of the MOB V2 clade, which\ncomprises plasmids of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria\n(pBBR1 of Bordetella bronchiseptica  is an archetype of the\ngroup) [ 30]. Plasmids pMARC4, pMOS2 and pAES1 encode\nsingle mobilization proteins (MobA), which share the highest\nlevel of aa sequence identity (40 to 60%) with the MobA protein\nencoded by the small cryptic plasmid pWKS1 of Paracoccus\npantotrophus DSM 11072 [12]. Significant aa sequence identity\n(from 30 to 40%) with the pBBR1 relaxase was also observed\n(Figure S2). In each case the oriT sites are situated upstream\nof the mobA genes. The predicted oriTs of pMOS2\n(AATTTGGaCgcagGaCAAATTGTCTAGTaAGTgcACATttttCTc\naaaT-3’) and pMARC4 are highly related (62% nucleotide\nsequence identity; nucleotides conserved in pMARC4 are\nshown in uppercase), while the oriT of pAES1 is more\ndivergent (nucleotides conserved in all three oriTs are\nunderlined).\nAdditional genetic load\nBesides the REP, TA, PAR, R-M and MOB modules, the\nanalyzed plasmids contain diverse accessory genetic\ninformation, including two insertion sequences (ISs) in pAES7\nand pMARC3 (Figure 1). Plasmid pAES7 carries the functional\nelement IS Paes2 (IS427 group, IS 5 family), which was\nidentified previously by its transposition into the trap plasmid\npMAT1 [ 5]. IS Paes2 is bordered by dinucleotide (TA) direct\nrepeats (DR), which represent the duplicated target site of\ntransposition.\nThe IS of pMARC3 is a novel element that we have\ndesignated as IS Pmar4 (1343 bp). It contains 12-bp-long\nimperfect terminal IR sequences (5'-ATGGc/tCCGCCCC-3')\nand carries a single ORF ( orf5), encoding a predicted protein\nwith similarity to transposases of the IS 110 family (IS 1111\ngroup). IS Pmar4 is not flanked by DRs in the pMARC3\ngenome, which is a typical feature of members of the IS 110\nfamily.\nAn intriguing feature of all but one of the plasmids (pMARC3)\nis the presence of related ORFs ( orf2), placed downstream of\nthe predicted rep genes (Figure 1). These ORFs encode\nputative proteins (Orf2) with low, but significant similarity [at\nleast 30% aa identity (E value 1e-04)] to entry exclusion-like\nproteins 1 (Exc1). All of these predicted proteins contain a\nconserved helix-turn-helix domain (HTH_17) in their N-terminal\nregion (Figure S3 in the supplemental material).\nEntry exclusion (EEX) systems prevent the entry of\nexogenous plasmids into a host cell carrying an identical or\nrelated EEX system. It is thought that EEX is a specific feature\nof all conjugative plasmids [ 32]. The exclusion phenotype has\nbeen observed for mobilizable plasmid ColE1, whose exc1 and\nexc2 genes were predicted to encode the EEX system [ 33].\nAlthough subsequent studies [ 34] excluded the possibility of\nexc1 and exc2 involvement in plasmid exclusion, homologous\ngenes are still being annotated and described in the literature\nas entry exclusion components, e.g. [35].\nThe examined plasmids of Paracoccus spp. were found to\ncontain only one of these genes – exc1. This is not a unique\nfeature, since related “orphan” exc1-like genes have been\nidentified in several other plasmids, including pKlebB-K17/80 of\nKlebsiella pneumoniae  [36] and pMWHK1 of Pedobacter\ncryoconitis BG5 [ 35]. The conserved position of this gene,\naccompanying different REP modules, strongly suggests that\nthe Exc1 proteins may play an important role in the biology of\nthese plasmids. However, their specific function has yet to be\ndetermined.\nDownstream of the exc1 genes in several plasmids (pAES3,\npAES4, pHAE1, pHAE2, pMARC1, pMARC2, pMOS2 and\npMOS7), putative plasmids islets (PI) were identified, i.e.\nhorizontally-acquired DNA regions of lower than average GC\ncontent (Figure 1). The ORFs encoded within these PI (listed in\nTable 2) show similarity to genes (mainly of unknown function)\nconserved in the chromosomes of many bacteria.\nTable 2.

These plasmids have highly conserved\nbackbones (REP and TA modules showing approx. 86%\nnucleotide sequence identity), but they contain different PIs\n(Figure 3). Plasmids pMARC2 and pHAE4 represent an\nanalogous pair of related replicons containing different PIs\n(Figure 1). The PI of pMOS7 carries two ORFs, including orf4\nencoding a predicted retron-type reverse transcriptase, while\nthat of pMARC1 is composed of orf3, encoding a putative\nDUF805 transmembrane protein and orf4, encoding a protein\ncontaining a conserved domain of RelA and SpoT proteins\n(both proteins are involved in the metabolism of the regulatory\ncompound guanosine 3',5'-bis-pyrophosphate, ppGpp, which\nplays a crucial role in the bacterial stringent response).\nThe PI of pMARC2, another plasmid of P. marcusii  (strain\nDSM 11574), contains a pair of overlapping genes (1-bp\noverlap), orf3 and orf4, conserved (in synteny) in several\nbacterial chromosomes. The first gene of this predicted module\nencodes a putative ATPase with significant similarity to the\nSMC proteins, which play an important role in chromosome\ncondensation, packaging, partitioning and DNA repair [ 37]. The\ndownstream orf4 encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown\nfunction. The closest homologs of orf3 and orf4 were identified\nwithin the chromosome of Pedobacter heparinus  DSM 2366\n(accession nos YP_003093112 and YP_003093113,\nrespectively).\nThe largest of the plasmids analyzed in this study, pMARC4,\ndoes not contain a PI, but it does encode proteins possibly\ninvolved in carbohydrate metabolism. The predicted proteins\nshow significant similarity to (i-ii) acyltransferases (Orf5 and\nOrf7), (iii) polysaccharide biosynthesis protein (Orf10), (iv)\nphosphoribosyltransferase (Orf11), (v) dolichyl-phosphate\nmannose synthase (Orf12), and (vi) glycosyltransferase\n(Orf13). Two other ORFs ( orf6 and orf14) encode a putative\nundecaprenyl-diphosphate phosphatase and UDP-glucose 6-\ndehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.22), respectively. It has been\ndemonstrated that Orf6 homologs are involved in the synthesis\nand recycling of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), a lipid\ncarrier of glycan biosynthetic intermediates of carbohydrate\npolymers exported to the bacterial cell envelope [ 38], while\nOrf14 relatives are responsible for the NAD-dependent\noxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, a key\ncomponent in the biosynthesis of gellan (extracellular\npolysaccharide of biotechnological value) [ 39]. Based on these\nsimilarities, it is likely that the pMARC4-encoded gene cluster\nmay be involved in the biosynthesis of envelope-associated\npolysaccharides.\nAnother plasmid, pMOS6 of P. marcusii  OS22, besides\nseveral ORFs of unknown function, carries orf4 encoding a\nputative zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH_ZINC),\nFigure 3.

Related enzymes catalyze the oxidation of\nalcohols, with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide (NAD) [ 41]. The most similar alcohol\ndehydrogenase (99% aa sequence identity) is encoded by\nMethylobacterium chloromethanicum  CM4 (accession no\nYP_002424246).\nDistribution of related plasmids in genus Paracoccus\nWe analyzed the distribution of the replication modules of the\npAES, pHAE, pMARC and pMOS plasmids in the genomes of\n20 strains representing 19 species of Paracoccus spp. To do\nthis, a specific DNA probe for each plasmid ( rep gene fragment\namplified by PCR and DIG-labeled) was used in dot blot\nhybridization to screen total DNAs isolated from the paracoccal\nstrains.\nThis analysis revealed that the majority of the analyzed\nplasmids occur exclusively in the multireplicon carotenoid-\nproducing species (LMG P-21093, OS22, DSM 11574, DSM\n19484), although none of the replicons was present in all four\nstrains (Figure 4). The strains P. haeundaensis LMG P-21093\nand P. aestuarii  DSM 19484 displayed an almost identical\nhybridization pattern (7 common replicons), which was also\nsimilar to that of P. marcusii  OS22 (4 common plasmids). In\ncontrast, the hybridization pattern of two strains of P. marcusii\n(OS22 and DSM 11574) was significantly different, indicating\nthe presence of four strain-specific replicons (pMARC2,\npMARC3, pMARC4 and pMOS2), which were unique among\nParacoccus spp. (Figure 4).\nA few related plasmids were also detected in other species,\nlocated on distant branches of the phylogenetic tree, which\npoints to the role of horizontal gene transfer in the\ndissemination of these replicons. The most ubiquitous replicons\nwere plasmids related to pAES4, which were detected in 6\nstrains, including P. zeaxanthinifaciens  ATCC 21588T, P.\nthiocyanatus JCM 20756 and P. yeei CCUG 46822 (Figure 4).\nHost range of the Paracoccus spp. plasmids\nThe host range of the paracoccal plasmids in several\nbacterial strains belonging to the Alpha-, Beta- or\nGammaproteobacteria was examined. For this analysis we\nemployed REP regions representing different groups of\nplasmids (Figure 2): (i-ii) pAES1 and pMOS7, (iii) pAES7, (iv)\npMARC2 and (v) pMOS6. The REPs were cloned within the\nmultiple cloning site (MCS) of the mobilizable vector pABW1\n(Kmr, oriV ColE1, oriT RK2) (see Methods for details) and the\nresulting plasmids were introduced into 9 strains of\nAlphaproteobacteria (Rifr derivatives of Paracoccus spp. strains\nP. alcaliphilus  JCM 7364, P. aminophilus  JCM 7686, P.\naminovorans JCM 7685, P. kondratievae  NCIMB 13773, P.\npantotrophus DSM 11072, P. versutus  UW225, as well as\nRhizobium etli CE3 and Ochrobactrum sp. LM19R, one strain\nof Betaproteobacteria (Alcaligenes sp. LM16R) and two strains\nof Gammaproteobacteria (Pseudomonas sp. LM7R and E. coli\nBR825\nThe constructed shuttle plasmids contained an E. coli -\nspecific pMB1 (ColE1-type) replication system, which is\nfunctional in neither Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria nor in\nPseudomonas sp. LM7R and E. coli  BR825\n(Gammaproteobacteria; the BR825 strain carries a mutation\nwithin the DNA polymerase I gene that blocks pMB1\nreplication). Therefore, the functions required for replication\nand maintenance of these plasmids in the tested hosts have to\nbe provided by the paracoccal REP modules. It is important to\nmention that the Paracoccus spp. strains, in which the\nplasmids were tested for their ability to replicate, were not the\noriginal hosts of any of these plasmids, and most of these\nstrains did not render a positive hybridization with the REP\nprobes of such plasmids (Figure 4).\nAll of the shuttle plasmids were found to replicate exclusively\nin strains of Alphaproteobacteria, which indicates the relatively\nnarrow host range of the tested REP modules. This is in\nagreement with the results of our previous studies, which\nshowed that the plasmids of Paracoccus spp. are not\npromiscuous (e.g. [10]).\nMembers of the genus Paracoccus are not naturally\ncompetent for transformation, therefore conjugal transfer is the\nonly efficient way of introducing of foreign DNA into their cells.\nUnfortunately, conjugative plasmids (or ICE elements) have not\nyet been identified in these bacteria. We also do not know\nwhether such replicons are present in the natural host strains\nof the plasmids analyzed in this study ( P. aestuarii , P.\nhaeundensis and P. marcusii). However all of them (as well as\nmany other Paracoccus spp. and numerous\nAlphaproteobacteria) carry mega-sized replicons, some of\nwhich could be self-transmissible.\nUntil now, the complete nucleotide sequences of only three\nParacoccus spp. genomes (with defined physical maps of\nchromosomes and plasmids) have been deposited in the NCBI\ndatabase ( P. denitrificans  PD1222, P. aminophilus  JCM 7686\nand Paracoccus sp. N5). Our detailed in silico  analysis\nrevealed that each of the strains carries one replicon\n(chromosome II, megaplasmid pAMI8 and a replicon referred to\nas contig 3, respectively) containing a complete predicted type\nIV secretion system, with a potential to support the conjugal\ntransfer of mobilizable plasmids. Plasmid mobilization might be\ntherefore a frequent phenomenon in Paracoccus spp.,\nespecially when the fact that the majority of the plasmids\ncharacterized in this study (9 replicons) contained the MOB\nmodules is taken into account.\nVector cassette construction\nTo facilitate genetic manipulation of the carotenoid-producing\nstrains of Paracoccus spp. two vector cassettes were\nconstructed (see Methods for details). We used REP regions of\nplasmids pMOS6 ( P. marcusii OS22) and pAES7 ( P. aestuarii\nDSM 19484), which were free of the majority of restriction sites\ncommonly found in the MCSs of many cloning vectors. The\nconstruction of these cassettes was performed according to the\ngeneral scheme used for the generation of the DIY (Do It\nYourself) cassettes, described in our previous study [10].\nThe cassettes contain (i) the REP regions, (ii) a kanamycin\nresistance gene, providing a selectable marker convenient for\nParacoccus spp. (and other Alphaproteobacteria), and (iii) a\nMOB module, which enables conjugal transfer of the plasmids\nPlasmids of Carotenoid-Producing Paracoccus spp.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\nFigure 4.  Distribution of the REP modules analyzed in this study in the Paracoccus spp. genomes.   A specific DNA probe\n(fragment of a rep gene amplified by PCR and DIG-labeled) was prepared for each analyzed REP module and used in dot blot\nhybridization analysis with total DNA isolated from 20 strains of Paracoccus spp. The results are presented as a matrix. The\nrelatedness of the tested Paracoccus strains is shown beneath by a phylogenetic tree based on their 16S rDNA sequences. The\ntree was constructed by the neighbor-joining algorithm with Kimura corrected distances.

Both cassettes, designated DIY pMOS6 and\nDIYpAES7, also contain polylinkers with a number of restriction\nsites to facilitate their insertion into different locations (plasmids\npKRP-DYIpMOS6 and pKRP-DIY pAES7; Figure 5). The pKRP-DIY\nplasmids are not cloning vectors and they serve exclusively as\na source of the DIY cassettes. Insertion of a single cassette\ninto any E. coli plasmid can create a mobilizable shuttle vector.\nThe cassettes were used to construct two mobilizable E. coli-\nParacoccus spp. shuttle vectors pVIV6 and pVIV7, whose\ngenetic organization is shown in Figure 5. These vectors also\ncarry a MluI restriction fragment of E. coli -specific plasmid\npBGS18 containing (i) a replication system originating from\npMB1 (non functional in Paracoccus spp.) and (ii) a selection\ncassette (MCS and the lacZ’ gene) enabling the identification of\nrecombinant molecules by \"blue-white\" screening. These\nshuttle vectors proved to be good cloning vectors with specific\nfeatures determined by the DIY cassettes (data not shown).\nThere are also available some other cloning vectors based\non the REP modules of Paracoccus spp. plasmids. They\ncontain replication systems of pTAV1 (P. versutus UW1) [42] or\npAMI plasmids of P. aminophilus JCM 7686 [ 10]. Although all\nof them are functional in Alphaproteobacteria, their stability\nsignificantly varies in different hosts [ 10]. Therefore there is a\nneed to enrich the pool of such vectors, which will enable\nselection of the most convenient one for a given host and task.\nFigure 5.

Three of these strains ( P. haeundaensis\nLG P-21903, P. marcusii OS22 and patented P. marcusii DSM\n11574) synthesize astaxantin, which is a commercially\nproduced carotenoid used in a range of industrial applications.\nThe DIY cassettes and shuttle vectors constructed in this study\nmay facilitate further genetic analysis of these\nbiotechnologically important bacteria.\nUntil now, small alphaproteobacterial plasmids have been\nneglected by researchers, e.g. complete nucleotide sequences\nof only four such plasmids of Paracoccus spp. were available -\npWKS1 of P. pantotrophus  DSM 11072 [ 12] and pAMI2,\npAMI3, pAMI7 of P. aminophilus  JCM 7686 [ 10,11]. Interest\nhas almost exclusively been focused on mega-sized replicons,\nwhich appear to be less diverse than the plasmids\ncharacterized in this study. Comparative analysis has revealed\nthat the plasticity and diversity of Paracoccus spp. plasmids\nresult from (i) recombinational shuffling of genetic modules of\nthe plasmid backbones, (ii) insertion of exogenous foreign\nDNA, including commonly identified plasmid islets (PIs), as well\nas (iii) the acquisition of novel replicons. Our detailed\ndescription of the genetic content of these plasmids allows\nprediction of the possible origin of individual genes (or sets of\ngenes) and the direction of horizontal gene flow in this group of\nbacteria.\nSome of the plasmids characterized in this study (pAES1,\npAES2, pAES3, pEAS4, pHAE1 and pHAE2).carry replication\nsystems which occur exclusively in the phylogenetically closely\nrelated orange-pigmented strains of Paracoccus spp. ( Figure\n4). This suggests that their ancestor replicons might have been\nacquired a long time ago (from an evolutionary point of view)\nby a progenitor strain. In contrast, a few plasmids (pMARC2,\npMARC3, pMARC4, pMOS2), present only in single strains,\nare unique among Paracoccus spp., which suggests their\nrelatively recent acquisition. Interestingly, two of the\naforementioned replicons (pAES4 and pMARC2) encode\nrelated Rep proteins, which may be considered as archetypes\nof a novel group of plasmid replication initiators.\nAnalysis of plasmid host range strongly suggests that the\nAlphaproteobacteria is a kind of “isolated island”, since all\nplasmids identified so far in these bacteria (including those\nanalyzed in this study) are narrow-host-range class-specific\nreplicons. They do not replicate in Beta- or\nGammaproteobacteria, and vice versa , foreign plasmids (with\nthe exception of broad host range replicons) do not replicate in\nalphaproteobacterial hosts. This isolation seems to be the main\nfactor limiting plasmid diversity in Alphaproteobacteria. These\nobservations also suggest that Alphaproteobacteria may\nencode as yet unidentified host-specific factors that are crucial\nfor the maintenance of certain types of plasmids. The\nidentification of such factors is an immediate goal of our future\nstudies.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains and culture conditions\nThe following strains of the genus Paracoccus were used in\nthis study: (i) P. aestuarii [43], (ii) P. haeundaensis LG P-21903\n[44], (iii) P. marcusii [45], (iv) P. marcusii OS22 [46] as well as\n(v-xviii) P. alcaliphilus  JCM 7364 [ 47], P. aminophilus  JCM\n7686 [48], P. aminovorans JCM 7685 [ 48], P. halophilus JCM\n14014 [ 49], P. homiensis  DSM 17862 [ 50], P. kondratievae\nNCIMB 13773 [ 51], P. koreensis  JCM 21670 [ 52], P.\nmethylutens DM12 [ 53], P. pantotrophus  DSM 11072 [ 54], P.\npantotrophus KL100 [ 6], P. seriniphilus  DSM 14827 [ 55], P.\nsolventivorans DSM 11592 [ 56], P. sulfuroxidans  DSM 14013\n[57], P. thiocyanatus JCM 7364 [ 58], P. versutus UW1 [ 59], P.\nversutus UW225 [ 60], P. yeei  CCUG 46822 [ 61] and P.\nzeaxanthinifaciens ATCC 21588 [62]. Other strains used in this\nstudy were (i) Rhizobium etli  CE3 [ 63], Ochrobactrum sp.\nLM19R [ 10], ( Alphaproteobacteria) (ii) Alcaligenes sp. LM16R\n[10] ( Betaproteobacteria), and (iii) Eschericha coli  – strains\nTG1 [ 64], BR825 [ 65] and Pseudomonas sp. LM7R [ 66]\n(Gammaproteobacteria). As recipients in triparental matings,\nrifampicin-resistant (Rif r) derivatives of the wild-type strains\nwere used. Bacteria were grown in LB (Luria Bertani) medium\n[67], at 37°C ( E. coli ) or 30°C (other strains). P. homiensis\nDSM 17862 was cultivated in Marine Broth (Difco) and R. etli\nCE3 in TY medium [ 68]. Where necessary, the medium was\nsupplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (50\nμg/ml) and rifampicin (50 μg/ml).\nPlasmids used and constructed in this study\nThe following plasmid vectors were used: (i) pABW1 (Kmr; ori\npMB1; oriT RK2; MCS- lacZ') [ 69], pBGS18 (Km r; ori pMB1;\nMCS) [ 70], pBluescript KSII (Ap r; ori pMB1; MCS- lacZ') [ 71],\npGEM-T Easy (Promega), pKRP12 (Ap r; Km r; ori pMB1) [ 72],\npDIY-KM (Ap r; Km r; ori pMB1) [ 10]. Plasmids constructed in\nthis study were (i-v) pABW-AES1, pABW-AES7, pABW-\nMARC2, pABW-MOS6 and pABW-MOS7 – shuttle plasmids\nused for host range analysis, (vi-ix) pKRP-DIY AES7, pKRP-\nDIYMOS6, pBS-DIY AES7 and pBS-DIY MOS6 – containing DIY\ncassettes, and (x-xi) shuttle vectors pVIV6 and pVIV7.\nShuttle plasmids pABW-AES1, pABW-AES7, pABW-\nMARC2, pABW-MOS6 and pABW-MOS7 (containing REP\nregions of plasmids pAES1, pAES7, pMARC2, pMOS6 and\npMOS7, respectively) were constructed by cloning of REP-\ncontaining plasmid restriction fragments (pAES7, pMARC2,\npMOS6 and pMOS7) or DNA fragment amplified by PCR\n(pAES1; primers used are listed in Table S2 in the\nsupplemental material) into the MCS of mobilizable vector\npABW1.\nThe plasmids representing the source of the DIY cassettes\nwere constructed in several steps. First, the REP modules of\npAES7 and pMOS6 were amplified by PCR (pMOS6; primers\nlisted in Table S2) or recovered within 1.9 kb SacI-NotI\nrestriction fragment (pAES7) and cloned into vector pGEM-T\nEasy. These modules were then excised from the recombinant\nplasmids with restriction endonuclease NotI and cloned into\ncompatible sites of plasmid pBS-MOBKm (pBluescript SKII\ncontaining the Kmr cassette from pMBS1 and the BHR plasmid\nPlasmids of Carotenoid-Producing Paracoccus spp.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80258\nRK2 MOB module within its MCS). The REP-Km r-MOB\ncassettes were excised from the recombinant plasmids and\ninserted (i) between HindIII sites of plasmid pKRP12 (HindIII\ndigestion of pKRP12 removed the original resistance gene\ncassette of this plasmid), yielding plasmids pKRP-DIY AES7 and\npKRP-DIYMOS6, or (ii) cloned into the MCS of Bluescript SKII,\nyielding plasmids pBS-DIYAES7 and pBS-DIYMOS6.\nThe mobilizable E. coli -Paracoccus spp. shuttle plasmids\npVIV6 and pVIV7 were constructed by ligation of the DIYpAES7 or\nDIYpMOS6 cassettes (excised from pBS-DIY AES7 and pBS-\nDIYMOS6, respectively) with MluI-cleaved pBGS18.\nPlasmid DNA isolation, genetic manipulations and PCR\nconditions\nPlasmid DNA was isolated using a standard alkaline lysis\nprocedure [ 73] and when required, purified by CsCl-ethidium\nbromide density gradient centrifugation. Total DNA was\nisolated from Paracoccus spp. using the procedure described\nby Chen and Kuo [ 74]. Southern hybridization analysis and\ncommon DNA manipulation methods were performed\naccording to Sambrook and Russell [ 67]. Oligonucleotides\nused to generate molecular probes are listed in Table S2. PCR\nwas performed in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf) using HiFi\npolymerase (Qiagen; with supplied buffer), dNTP mixture and\ntotal DNA of Paracoccus spp. with appropriate primer pairs\n(listed in Table S2).\nIntroduction of plasmid DNA into bacterial cells and\nplasmid stability assay\nDNA was introduced into Rif r (Alcaligenes sp. LM16R,\nOchrobactrum sp. LM19R, Paracoccus spp. and Pseudomonas\nsp. LM7R) or Str r (R. etli  CE3) recipient strains by triparental\nmating as previously described [ 42]. Chemical transformation\nof E. coli  cells was performed according to the method of\nKushner [ 75]. The stability of plasmids was tested during\ngrowth under non-selective conditions. Stationary-phase\ncultures of plasmid-containing strains were diluted in fresh\nmedium without antibiotic selection and cultivated for\napproximately 10, 20 and 30 generations. Samples were\ndiluted and plated onto solid medium lacking selective\nantibiotics. One hundred colonies were tested for the presence\nof the Km r marker by replica plating. Plasmid retention was\ndetermined from the percentage of kanamycin-resistant\ncolonies.\nDNA sequencing\nThe nucleotide sequences of plasmids pMARC and pMOS\nwere determined in the DNA Sequencing and Oligonucleotide\nSynthesis Laboratory at the Institute of Biochemistry and\nBiophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, using a dye\nterminator sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (ABI\n377 Perkin Elmer). Primer walking was used to complete the\nsequences. In the case of pMARC2, pMARC3 and pMOS2,\nunidirectional nested deletions within the cloned plasmid\nrestriction fragments were generated by the use of\nexonuclease III and S1 nuclease (ExoIII/S1 deletion kit; MBI\nFermentas). The nucleotide sequences of plasmids pAES and\npHAE were determined by pyrosequencing performed by\nGenomed.\nBioinformatic analysis\nPlasmid nucleotide sequences were analyzed using Clone\nManager (Sci-Ed8) and Artemis software [ 76]. Similarity\nsearches were performed using the BLAST programs [ 77]\nprovided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information\n(NCBI) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Comparison\nsearches of insertion sequences were performed with ISfinder\n[78]. Protein homology detection and structure prediction were\nperformed using the HHpred program [ 79]. Protein families\nwere identified using the PFAM database [ 80]. Helix-turn-helix\nmotifs were predicted using the HELIX-TURN-HELIX MOTIF\nPREDICTION program [ 81]. Phylogenetic analyses were\nperformed using the Phylogeny Inference Package – PHYLIP\nv3.69 [82], applying the neighbor-joining algorithm with Kimura\ncorrected distances and 1000 bootstrap replicates. DNA\nsequence alignments obtained using ClustalW [ 83] were\nmanually refined using the T-Coffee Multiple Sequence\nAlignment program [84]. The tree was rendered with TreeView\nversion 1.6.6 [85].\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers\nPlasmid nucleotide sequences have been annotated and\ndeposited in the GenBank database (accession numbers are\ngiven in parenthesis): pAES1 (JQ041633), pAES2 (JQ065021),\npAES3 (JQ066766), pAES4 (JQ684025), pAES7 (JQ796370),\npHAE1 (JQ066767), pHAE2 (JQ684024), pMARC1\n(KC542384), pMARC2 (KC561053), pMARC3 (KC561054),\npMARC4 (KC561055), pMOS2 (JQ664550), pMOS6\n(JQ678602) and pMOS7 (JQ684023).\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1.

All retrotransposons have RTs, and these enzymes\nare classified into two main classes on the basis of their mechanism of\ntransposition and DNA organization: 1) LTR-retrotransposons, which are\ncharacterized by direct repeats of a few hundred base pairs at their ends (long\nterminal repeats), generally containing thegag and pol genes; the Pol enzyme\nencoded by these sequences has several enzymatic domains (RT, RNase H,\nintegrase, and PR or proteinase); and 2) non-LTR retrotransposons, which have\nno terminal repeats and are highly abundant in eukaryotes (known as LINEs in\nmammals). They contain a single ORF encoding a protein with RT and EN\n(endonuclease) domains or two ORFs, the first displaying similarity to thegag\ngene of retroviruses, and the second encoding the RT and EN domains. LTR\nretrotransposons are thought to have evolved from non-LTR retrotransposons\nthrough the acquisition of an integrase, and retroviruses are thought to have\nevolved from LTR retrotransposons through the incorporation of envelope (env\ndomain) genes from other viruses [\n3,4]. Retrotransposons have greatly influenced\neukaryotic genomes, accounting for about 45% of the human genome and driving\ngenome evolution and changes in gene expression [\n5].\nBacterial RTs were discovered much later, in a retroelement known as a retron\n[6–7], which synthesizes a large number of multicopy single-stranded DNA\n(msDNA) molecules. Retrons are thought to have no independent mobility, and\ntheir function remains unknown. Another type of bacterial retroelement, the DGR\n(diversity-generating retroelement), was first described in 2002 [\n8]. DGRs consist\nof an RT, an accessory protein (encoded by theatd gene), an RNA template, and a\ngene encoding the target protein (mtd), which contains a C-terminal variable\nregion (VR). DGRs do not appear to be mobile, but they produce diverse\nsequences in the VR region, potentially conferring resistance against phages [\n9–\n10]. Bacteria have other mechanisms of antiphage immunity, including CRISPR\n(clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) and Abi (abortive\nbacteriophage infection) systems. CRISPR and theircas-associated genes encode a\nsequence-specific mechanism of defense against bacteriophages and plasmids [\n11–\n13], consisting of an array of short repetitive sequences (,40 bp long) separated\nby equally short spacer sequences. Two uncharacterized classes of bacterial RTs\nhave been shown to be associated with CRISPR/cas elements, and some RTs are\nfused to cas genes [\n14–15], but their role in CRISPR function is unknown. The\nAbi system blocks phages at different stages in the infection cycle and is generally\nmediated by a single plasmid-encoded gene. The AbiA, AbiK, and Abi-P2 systems\nare known to include a RT [\n16–18]. Mutations of the gene encoding the RT of\nAbiK have been shown to block infection [16], and this enzyme has recently been\nshown to have genuine RT activity [19].\nThe best characterized mobile bacterial retroelements are the catalytic RNAs\nknown as group II introns. These mobile elements were first identified in the\nmitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes and plants, and have\nsubsequently been described in bacteria and archaea [\n20–24]. Group II introns\nconsist of a structured RNA that folds into a conserved three-dimensional\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 2/1 6\nstructure organized into six double-helical domains, DI to DVI [25]. Most\nbacterial group II introns have an open reading frame (ORF) encoding an intron-\nencoded protein (IEP) in DIV. This IEP consists of an RT followed by a putative\nRNA-binding domain with RNA splicing or maturase activity (the X domain),\nand, in some intron lineages, a C-terminal DNA-binding and endonuclease\ndomain [\n26–28]. It is thought that both nuclear spliceosomal introns and non-\nLTR retrotransposons evolved from mobile group II introns [26–32], which may\nalso influence bacterial evolution [33].\nMuch less is known about the RTs of prokaryotes than about those of\neukaryotes, and many of these enzymes remain uncharacterized. Two surveys [14–\n15] investigating the presence of RT sequences in prokaryotic genomes revealed\nlarge numbers of diverse, uncharacterized RTs and RT-like sequences, which were\ngrouped into 20 phylogenetic classes with 11 domain architectures [\n15]. Here, we\nused consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from GenBank\nand other sources, via RAST [34,35], available from the PATRIC (Pathogenic\nResource Integration Center) platform [36], to compile data for the currently\nannotated reverse transcriptases from completely sequenced bacterial genomes.\nPhylogenetic analyses revealed that bacterial RTs could be classified into 17 main\ngroups. We provide strong evidence for the definition of several classes of RT that\ncould provide the basis for a more comprehensive annotation of RT sequences in\ndatabases.\nMaterials and Methods\nCollation of the RT dataset\nFor phylogenetic analyses, we used an RT (RT 0–7 domains) dataset described in a\nprevious study [28] and including representatives of group II (GII) intron ORFs\nof subclasses A, C, D, E (E1/E2), F and the new varietyg1, with no recognizable D/\nEn region (En2), together with representatives of subclasses B, CL (CL1A, CL1B,\nCL2A, and CL2B), and ML, with a recognizable D/En region (En+). The GII RT\ndataset included 153 unique sequences that were#85% identical, with the\nexception of the subclass A RT sequences E.c.I4 and S.f.I1, because the bacterial\ngroup II intron database (\nhttp://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/,groupii/index.html?)\ncontains only three reported members of this subclass, which are almost identical\n(99% identity). Other uncharacterized bacterial RT sequences [\n15] corresponding\nto the group II intron-like groups G2L1-5 and G2L-other (24), retrons/retron-like\nRTs (113), DGRs (36), the abortive phage infection AbiK (3) and Abi-P2 (8)\ngroups, and other unknown RT groups (UG) 1–9 and unclassified (UN) elements\n(118) were then added to the group II intron RTs. Multiple sequence alignments\n(MSAs) including only sequences displaying#85% identity were generated for\nthis dataset and subjected to various phylogenetic analyses, to determine the\nconsistency of the monophyly previously proposed for the different groups [\n15],\nand to select reliable representative members. AbiA sequences and sequences for\nthe group II intron-like G2L5 group were not included in the final dataset,\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 3/1 6\nbecause the AbiA sequences displayed poor conservation of the RT domain and\nthe G2L5 sequences did not form a consistent supported group in our analyses.\nThe final dataset (Table S1) contained 277 sequences, 124 of which were assigned\nto RT groups other than group II intron ORFs.\nSearch for annotated bacterial RTs\nWe used the PATRIC platform to search for annotated bacterial RTs. This\nplatform offers consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from\nGenBank and other sources via RAST, the most widely used and highly cited\nautomated microbial annotation system [\n34–36]. For practical purposes, the\nsearch was carried out independently for the various phyla and classes for which\ncomplete genome sequences were available. At the time of analysis (06/23/2014),\nthe database contained 239 complete genomes for Alphaproteobacteria, 144 for\nBetaproteobacteria, 570 for Gammaproteobacteria and 156 for Delta/Epsilon\nProteobacteria. It also contained 556 complete genomes from phylum Firmicutes,\nincluding 418 from bacilli and 138 from clostridia. Complete genome sequences\nwere available for 339 actinobacteria, 98 members of the Bacteroidetes/green\nsulfur bacteria (phylum Chlorobi) group and 72 cyanobacteria. We searched the\nPATRIC database with the Feature Finder tool, searching for reverse transcriptase\ncoding sequences (CDS). The product sequence did not refer exclusively to reverse\ntranscriptases, but included heterogeneous annotations, such as retron-type RNA-\ndirected DNA polymerase, retron-type reverse transcriptase, mobile element\nprotein, hypothetical protein, conserved domain protein, RNA-directed DNA\npolymerase, probable group II intron maturase/reverse transcriptase, and\nribonuclease III. Nevertheless, the keyword ‘‘reverse transcriptase’’ was present in\nthe corresponding annotation in the PATRIC, BRC or Refseq database and a\nconserved RT domain was identified in all cases. Sequences were downloaded and\nanalyzed with Geneious Pro software (Biomatters Ltd.), and proteins of less than\n200 amino acids in length were discarded as probable fragments. We then used\nMAFFT and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix to align sequences for each phylum.\nThe % identity obtained with the distance matrix for the alignment was used to\nidentify protein sequences displaying#85% identity overall. For further analyses,\nwe retained 662 sequences: 293 sequences from Proteobacteria, 182 from\nFirmicutes, 22 from Actinobacteria, 60 from Bacteroidetes/green sulfur bacteria\nand 105 from Cyanobacteria. We used MAFFT to align these sequences with the\n277 RT sequences of the initial dataset, and the amino-acid region corresponding\nto RT domains 0 to 7 was then extracted. The annotated RTs from PATRIC\ndisplaying #85% identity (sequences displaying.85% identity were not found\nacross phyla) and different from the initial dataset (465 sequences) were retained:\n209 from Proteobacteria, 128 from Firmicutes, 13 from Actinobacteria, 42 from\nBacteroidetes/green sulfur bacteria and 73 from Cyanobacteria. We used MAFFT\nto generate a final alignment with 742 sequences (Figure S1), and 100 bootstrap\nrepetitions were carried out with GUIDANCE (\nhttp://guidance.tau.ac.il)[ 37]t o\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 4/1 6\nobtain alignment confidence scores for each pair of residues. The final alignment\nused for the phylogenetic analyses contained 254 informative positions.\nPhylogenetic analyses\nPhylogenetic analysis was performed with several different maximum likelihood\nestimation methods implemented in Geneious Pro (Biomatters Ltd.) and Cipres\nScience Gateway platform [\n38]. We generated unrooted trees with FastTree [39–\n40], using pseudocounts (recommended for sequences containing large numbers\nof gaps), a discrete gamma model with 20 rate categories (‘‘Gamma20’’) for\nbetween-site rate variation, and the WAG model of amino-acid evolution. Local\nsupport values for branches were obtained by applying the Shimodaira-Hasegawa\ntest to three alternative topologies (NNIs) around the split. It has been suggested\nthat, for very large phylogenies, FastTree is less sensitive to alignment and dataset\nsize than other maximum likelihood methods that estimate phylogeny very\nquickly with little or no loss of tree accuracy [40]. The other methods used\nincluded RAxML [41], with the LG amino-acid substitution model and a discrete\ngamma model with four categories and 400 bootstraps.\nResults and Discussion\nInsights from bacterial RT phylogeny\nAnnotated RTs were retrieved from the PATRIC database, as indicated in the\nMaterials and Methods. Searches were performed for most bacterial phyla, but\nonly RT sequences from phyla for which larger complete sequenced genomes were\navailable (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, the Bacteroidetes/green\nsulfur bacteria group and Cyanobacteria) and with large numbers of annotated\nRTs were included in the phylogenetic analyses. We generated a final dataset\ncontaining 742 RT sequences, and a MSA was constructed by GUIDANCE (Figure\nS1), for the generation of unrooted phylogenetic trees with FastTree (\nFigure 1A)\nand RAxML (Figure 1B).\nGroup II intron ORFs\nThe FastTree phylogeny (Figure 1A) strongly supported all previously described\nGII ORF classes, A, B, C, D, E, CL, ML, and the new varietiesg1 to g4 with a local\nvalue of 0.96 to 1. The RAxML phylogeny (Figure 1B) also supported the ORF\nclasses and varieties (bootstrap values of 71% to 100%), but provided low levels of\nstatistical support for class ML and subgroup CL1B. The RAxML method may be\nmore sensitive to the alignment and dataset size, due to the small number of\ncharacters (254 aa) in the alignment. Surprisingly, FastTree provided strong\nsupport (local value 0.99) for class F, for which weak statistical support was\nprovided by the tree generated by RAxML (Figure 1B), and by other previous\nmaximum likelihood estimations [28,42]. Class F corresponds to the previously\ndescribed varietiesg2–g4 [28], including c-Ku.st.I1, and the So.us.I2, Ge.ur.I1 and\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 5/1 6\nFigure 1. Bacterial RT phylogeny.Unrooted phylogenetic trees based on the alignment of the RT-domain\n(domains 0–7) of the 742 sequences used as the dataset. The group II intron ORF classes and varieties are\ndesignated according to the most recent proposals from Toroet al.in 2013 and Simonet al.in 2008 [\n28,42].\nAdditional group II intron ORF varieties are also annotated here (g5 and g6, see the results and discussion\nsection). Other RT groups are named as previously reported [15] and suggested in this work. (A) A consensus\nunrooted tree estimated by FastTree method. The main groups were color-coded to improve visualization and\ncollapsed at the internal nodes with local support values§0.96, with the exceptions of UG4 (0.84) and UG5\n(0.87). Local support values§0.95 at inner nodes are also indicated. (B) A consensus unrooted tree\nestimated by the RAxML method. The main groups were collapsed at the internal nodes with strong support\n(bootstrap values§75%), with the exception of class ML (55%), subgroup CL1B (34%) and varietyg3 (71%);\nUG10 (G2L3) (39%); and DGRs (17%). Inner nodes with strong statistical support (bootstrap values§80%)\nare also indicated.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083.g001\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 6/1 6\nPe.th.I2 RT sequences that cluster together in the inferred trees (this cluster is\nreferred to below as varietyg5), for which there was a high degree of support\n(local value of 0.96 and bootstrap value of 90%). Classes D and E appear to be\nsister clades in both trees (local value of 0.96 and bootstrap value of 80%),\nconsistent with the findings of a previous study [\n28]. Some RTs from class C\nintrons (D.pI1, Pe.th.I1 and Al.or.I2) were previously shown to form a divergent\nsubgroup [28]. In the phylogenetic trees generated by FastTree and RAxML, these\nRT sequences, together with sequences from other clostridia and gammaproteo-\nbacteria, including sequences from the current group II intron database (Na.th.I1,\nTc.po.I1 and Al.ma.I1), clustered together (local value of 1 and bootstrap value of\n92%) outside monophyletic class C, consistent with the monophyly of this\nsubgroup (referred to hereafter asg6). The class C andg6 introns have similar\nintron RNA structures [\n43], due to either convergent evolution under selective\npressure or the reshuffling of intron RNAs and IEPs.\nWe previously suggested [28] that intron ORF En+ classes (B, ML, and CL)\ncorrespond to a monophyletic intron lineage. However, the FastTree and RAxML\nphylogenies showed that classes B and ML were separated from the CL class by\nseveral ORF En\n2 classes. Furthermore, in the FastTree phylogeny, classes CL, F,\nand variety g1 branched from a strongly supported node (local value 0.99).\nHowever, neither FastTree with a shorter alignment (less aligned residues, not\nshown) nor RAxML yielded this tree topology. In the inferred tree with RAxML,\nclass F was found outside of the ORF En\n+ nodes, and the inner common node for\nclasses CL, A and theg1 variety lacked statistical support. The inner nodes of the\ntrees remain to be resolved, so relationships between En+ and En2 classes are less\nreliable with the large dataset including RTs other than group II intron ORFs.\nRTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systems\nRTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systems without recognizable intron RNA\nstructures are located at the base of the group II intron lineage, together with the\ng6 intron variant and other unclassified group II intron RTs. The current\nclassification [\n44] includes three major types of CRISPR–Cas system (I, II and III),\nwith a further division into several subtypes and some chimeric variants. None of\nthe CRISPR-Cas systems with associated RTs belong to the type II lineage; some\nare classified as type III-A, but most are currently unclassified systems (type III\nsubtype U), probably corresponding to CRISPR-Cas chimera. Some of these\nCRISPR-Cas-associated RTs, which have no maturase domain, form mono-\nphyletic groups with strong support (local support value of 1 and bootstrap value\n§98%). These groups include the G2L2 group (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-\nRT1), all four members of which are from green sulfur bacteria, and the CRISPR-\nRT2 group, which includes three RTs from cyanobacteria. The previously\nproposed G2L1 group [\n15], which is also associated with CRISPR-Cas elements,\ncould be split into three distinct groups. Two groups potentially resulting from\nconvergent evolution were characterized on the basis of their RTs being fused to\nCas1-ORF proteins. One of these groups (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT6,\nwith a local support value of 1 and a bootstrap value of 100%) comprised the\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 7/1 6\ngreen sulfur bacterial RTs fromChlorobium phaeobacteroides DSM 266\n(gi|119357846) and Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme BU-1 (gi|68548733), and the\nsecond (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT5) corresponded to a single RT from\nthe gammaproteobacterium Vibrio vulnificus YJ016 (gi|37677204). A third group\nwas characterized by RTs consisting exclusively of the RT domain. This group\nincluded the RTs fromCandidatus kuenenia (gi|91201518) and a RT from\nDelsufobacca acetooxidans (gi|328952997) (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-RT7,\nlocal support value of 0.98 and bootstrap value of 94%). Similarly, the\nphylogenetic tree revealed the existence of other RTs also associated with CRISPR-\nCas systems, corresponding to a RT fromThioflavococcus mobilis (gi|431828084)\nand a RT fromRhodomicrobium vannielii (gi|312114615), hereafter referred to as\nCRISPR-RT3 and CRISPR-RT4, respectively. All the RTs associated with CRISPR-\nCas systems were organized into seven conserved domains and the characteristic\naspartate (DD) residues of the YADD motif located in the active site of the protein\nin domain 5 were 100% conserved. The tyrosine (Y) residue was replaced with a\nphenylalanine (F) residue in 66% of the sequences, whereas the alanine (A)\nresidue in the second position was conserved in 66% of cases. These RTs may,\ntherefore, have polymerase activity.\nGroup II-like intron ORFs with conserved maturase domains\nSimon and Zimmerly [15] defined five group II-like groups (G2L1–5) and a\ngroup with a single sequence (G2L-other) as paraphyletic characterized by an\napparent lack of intron RNA structure and a conserved maturase domain in the\ngroups G2L3–5 and G2L-other. The G2L5 sequences (gi|149173121 and\ngi|149176144 from Planctomyces maris and gi|87308561 fromBlastopirullela\nmarina) did not form a consistent supported group in our preliminary\nphylogenetic analyses and they were not included in the initial dataset of 277\nsequences. Nevertheless, the inclusion of these sequences in the final alignment\nand FastTree analysis revealed that the sequences fromPlanctomyces grouped\ntogether, but their relationships with the other RT sequences and defined RT\ngroups remain uncertain, since the nodes lack statistical support and closed\nrelatives to these sequences were not identified in our analysis (not shown). In our\nphylogenetic analyses with FastTree, G2L4 (2 sequences in the initial dataset), and\na RT fromMethylocella silvestris BL2 (gi| 217978298) formed a monophyletic\ngroup (local value of 1) that appeared to be interleaved with the CRISPR-\nassociated RTs (\nFigure 1A), including the G2L2 (CRISPR-RT1) and G2L1\n(CRISPR-RT5–7) groups. However, in the tree generated by RAxML (Figure 2B),\nG2L4 (bootstrap value of 100%) appeared at the base of a potential Abi lineage.\nG2L4 had a large number of substitutions per site (FastTree: 3.004 and RAxML:\n2.3), suggesting that this group is evolving rapidly. It is therefore possible that the\nposition of G2L4 in the phylogenetic analyses may be influenced by systematic\nerrors caused by the mutational saturation of the G2L4 sequences. The three\nmembers of G2L4 contain the YIDD sequence rather than the canonical YADD\nmotif in domain 5, and this is a distinctive unique feature of this group of RTs.\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 8/1 6\nFigure 2.

The G2L3 group is one of the larger RT groups, with 16 members from\nour dataset, and, in all these sequences, the alanine residue of the YADD motif is\nreplaced with a valine (V) residue. Thus, despite their conserved maturase\ndomain, G2L3 and G2L-other RTs may have an origin different from that of other\nG2L groups. We therefore suggest that these two groups of RTs should be\nrenamed, with the nomenclature used for RTs of unknown function, hereafter\nreferred to as UG10 (G2L-3) and UG11 (G2L-other), and that the G2L\nnomenclature should be retained only for the G2L4 group.\nRetrons/retron-like RTs\nA retron lineage is strongly supporte d in the phylogenies obtained with\nFastTree (local support value of 1) and RAxML (bootstrap value of 94%). In\nour analysis, this group expanded from six sequences in the initial dataset to\n102 sequences with #85% identity. This constitutes a very large increase. The\nretron-specific conserved motif (VTG) within RT domain 7 in the ‘‘Y’’ region\ncrucial for specific recognition and binding to the template-primer RNA used\nfor the synthesis of msDNA [45] was present in 47% of the sequences, with\nvariants including sequences with isoleucine/leucine (I/L) residue (26% of the\nsequences) in the first position. Moreover, the conserved NAXXH amino-acid\nmotif in region ‘‘X’’, located between domains 2 and 3, could be identified in\n59% of the sequences. The histidine (H)residue displayed 100% conservation\nin these sequences, whereas the alanine (A) and asparagine (N) residues were\nconserved in 87% and 62% of cases, respectively. We did not attempt to\nidentify potential msRNA/msDNA seco ndary structures, but our results\nsuggest that the members of this cluster are actual retron RT sequences.\nThe Abi lineage\nT h ep h y l o g e n e t i ca n a l y s is carried out with FastTree provided strong local\nsupport (0.98) for an Abi-related lineage of RTs, including the strongly\nsupported groups (local values of 0.95 to 1) Abi K; Abi-P2; UN1-5 and UG1,\n7–9. RAxML also supported a potential Abi-like lineage, but including only\nAbiK, Abi-P2, and the UN3–5 and UG8 groups. The relationships between\nthese RT groups and the UN1–2, UG1, UG7 and UG9 groups therefore remain\nunclear. An analysis of the corresponding sequences of the Abi lineage\n(RAxML) showed them to have a mean length of 562 aa, with a C-terminal\nregion of unknown domain architecture. These RTs lack the RT 0, 2a and 7\ndomains and the potentially active s i t ei nd o m a i n5h a sac o n s e r v e dY ( R /\nV)DD sequence. It would therefore be ofinterest to determine whether these\nproteins share biochemical properties, and whether they are all engaged in the\nabortive infection pathway.\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 10 / 16\nBacterial Reverse Transcriptases\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114083 November 25, 2014 11 / 16\nDGR RTs\nIn our analyses, a potential DGR clade containing 62 members was supported by\nthe FastTree phylogeny (local support value of 0.94). The mean length of 375 aa\nfor these sequences is consistent with the 378 aa reported as the mean length of\nDGR RTs [46]. It has been suggested that DGR RTs, although highly divergent,\nform a phylogenetic clade that is characterized by a (I/V/L)GxxxSQ motif in RT\ndomain 4 [46], which is sufficient to predict DGR association. We found that 57\nof the analyzed sequences contained the SQ motif in domain 4 and a Y(V/M)DD\nsequence in the active site of domain 5, which is also a feature of DGR RT\nsequences. The SQ residues varied in only five sequences, in which they were\nreplaced by AQ or AN dipetides, or lost altogether, these variants probably\ncorresponding to inactivation events or sequencing errors. The RAxML phylogeny\ndid not provide strong support for this clade (instead it strongly supported 10\nouter nodes within the clade grouping 46 sequences), but the FastTree phylogeny\nand the presence of the SQ motif suggest that the grouped sequences are DGR/\nDGR-like RTs.\nPhylogenetic distribution of RT groups\nAbout 57% of the bacterial RTs in the dataset corresponded to group II intron-\nencoded ORFs. The next most frequent groups were retrons (13.7%), DGRs\n(8.4%) and RTs of the Abi lineage (5.1%). However, the functions of bacterial RT\nsequences appear to be highly diverse, as many others could be classified into\ndifferent minority groups of unknown function (Figure 2A). RT sequences were\nfound to be broadly distributed across bacterial phyla, the number of RT\nsequences being generally correlated with the number of genomes sequenced, but,\nas shown inFigure 2B, the normalized sequence diversity (ratio of RTs#85%\nidentity per genome) was higher for green sulfur bacteria (1.36) and\nCyanobacteria (1.28), the values obtained for Proteobacteria and Firmicutes being\nmuch lower, at only 0.31 and 0.33, respectively. By contrast, phylum\nActinobacteria, for which a large number of genomes have been sequenced (339),\nhad a low diversity of RT sequences (0.07) (Figure 2B). If we consider the\ndistribution per RT class or per phylum (Figure 3A and 3B), Proteobacteria\ndisplay the greatest functional diversity, containing most groups, with the\nexception of UN2, which appears to be restricted to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.\nMoreover, five groups (G2L4, UG4, UG1, UN1 and UG9) are restricted to\nProteobacteria. Group II introns and DGRs appear to be the RTs most widely\ndistributed in bacterial phyla, followed by retrons, Abi, UG2 and CRISPR-Cas\nRTs. These RT groups appear to be the most relevant in bacteria, but minority\ngroups may correspond to evolving RTs with novel properties and functions.\nFigure 3.

The application of the widely recognized\nRAST procedure to all available genomesmade it possible to detect RT sequences in an\nunbiased manner, based on the most up-to-date data, rather than making use of\npotentially incomplete Blast searches, or missing or incorrect annotations. Several\ndifferent ML estimation methods were used for the phylogenetic analyses and FastTree\nwas found to estimate phylogeny with little or no loss of accuracy for the clustering of\nmajor RT groups, with lower sensitivity to dataset size than the RAxML method.\nHowever, the relationships between major classes remain unresolved and incon-\nsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the FastTree and RAxML\nmethods. We found that bacterial RTs could be classified into 17 main groups: group II\nintrons, retrons/retron-like RTs, diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), Abi-like\nRTs, CRISPR-Cas associated RTs, group II-like RTs (G2L), and 11 other groups of RTs\nof unknown function. We found that RT sequence diversity was greatest in green sulfur\nbacteria and cyanobacteria, but that proteobacteria displayed potentially greater\nfunctional diversity, with some groups restricted to this phylum.

Here we employed single cell genomics to analyze cell-to-cell genome content\nvariability and signatures of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and viral infections in ﬁve\ncells of Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, which were collected from a 3 km-deep\nfracture water in the 2.9 Ga-old Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa. Between 0 and\n32% of genes recovered from single cells were not present in the original, metagenomic\nassembly of Desulforudis, which was obtained from a neighboring subsurface fracture.\nWe found a transposable prophage, a retron, multiple clustered regularly interspaced\nshort palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and restriction-modiﬁcation systems, and an\nunusually high frequency of transposases in the analyzed single cell genomes. This\nindicates that recombination, HGT and viral infections are prevalent evolutionary events\nin the studied population of microorganisms inhabiting a highly stable deep subsurface\nenvironment.\nKeywords: single cell genomics, Desulforudis, evolution, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), transposases,\ntransposable phages, population genomics, terrestrial deep subsurface\nIntroduction\nDeep subsurface microorganisms constitute a signiﬁcant fraction of the living biomass on our\nplanet (Whitman et al., 1998; Kallmeyer et al., 2012), but our knowledge of these microor-\ng\nanisms remains very limited, due to the diﬃculties in accessing these environments without\nintroducing microbial contamination and to our inabilities to isolate the indigenous micro-\nbiota through cultivation ( Colwell and D’Hondt, 2013). Some deep subsurface fracture com-\nm\nunities have been physically isolated from other habitable environments for up to tens\nof millions of years and are characterized by extreme energy limitation. Existing data sug-\ngest that deep subsurface microbial communities diﬀer from those of surface environments\nLabonté et al. Single cell genomics of Firmicutes\nin taxonomic composition, scarce energy sources, and energy\nproduction aﬀected by a complete lack of light (\nStevens and\nMcKinley, 1995; Lin et al., 2006 ). They often have extremely low\nmetabolic rates and generation times that span hundreds to th ou-\nsands of years ( Phelps et al., 1994; Jørgensen and D’Hondt, 2006;\nLin et al., 2006; Onstott et al., 2014 ).\nThe deep fracture water of the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa\nis a mixture of ancient hydrothermal ﬂuid and meteoric water\n(\nLippmann et al., 2003; Onstott et al., 2006; Lippmann-Pipke\net al., 2011 ) that contains abiogenic hydrocarbons and H 2-rich\ngasses (Ward et al., 2004; Lollar et al., 2006, 2008, 2014 ) and har-\nbors unusual microbial communities and metazoans ( Takai et al.,\n2001a,b; Moser et al., 2005b; Borgonie et al., 2011 ). A composite\ngenome assembly of an indigenous ﬁrmicute Candidatus Desul-\nforudis audaxviator MP104C was obtained from metagenomic\nreads from fracture water collected from a 2.8 km-deep bore-\nhole in the Mponeng gold mine (\nChivian et al., 2008 ). The gene\ncontent of MP104C revealed a chemotactic sulfate-reducing b ac-\nterium capable of ﬁxing N 2 and CO2 while utilizing the chemical\nproducts of water radiolysis as its ultimate energy source ( Chi-\nvian et al., 2008 ). Some of its key metabolic features, such as\nN2 ﬁxation, cobalamin synthesis, and sulﬁte reduction appear\nto be products of ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) even ts\nfrom other bacteria and archaea. The presence of multiple tran s-\nposases and CRISPRs in the MP104C genome provided evidence\nof HGT and interactions with phages. Surprisingly, >99.9% of\nthe metagenomic reads from the Mponeng sample mapped to\nthe composite genome assembly, and only 32 positions in the\n2.35 Mbp genome contained single nucleotide polymorphisms.\nThis indicated a unique, one-species ecosystem with one of th e\nlowest reported rates of mutation. Ribosomal RNA sequences\nthat are near-identical to MP104C have been detected in many\nsubsurface sites outside the Witwatersrand Basin, includi ng in the\nFennoscandian Shield in Finland (\nItävaara et al., 2011 ), a deep\nsaline geothermal aquifer in Germany ( Lerm et al., 2013 ), and\nthe Juan de Fuca crustal basalt ﬂuids ( Jungbluth et al., 2013 ).\nThis suggests that D. audaxviator is highly adapted to condi-\ntions of the immense deep subsurface environment and has a\ncosmopolitan distribution. However, to the best of our knowl -\nedge, 16S rRNA sequences have remained the only type of infor-\nmation about Desulforudis from locations outside the Mponeng\nfracture, leaving its genetic diversity and associated evo lutionary\nand ecological implications largely unknown.\nSingle cell genomics (SCG) is a novel technology oﬀering\nrecovery of genomic information from individual, uncultiva ted\ncells (\nStepanauskas, 2012 ). SCG provides quantitative informa-\ntion of genomic variability in natural microbial communiti es,\nallowing for the study of gene exchange among cells and genom e\nrearrangements within a cell. Such information is hard to ob tain\nusing other methods, such as metagenomics, where genome\nassemblies are consensuses from a multitude of cells that ar e\nassumed to be clonal (\nDupont et al., 2012; Iverson et al., 2012;\nNarasingarao et al., 2012 ).\nTo better understand the evolutionary mechanisms of natu-\nral Desulforudis populations, we performed genomic sequenc-\ning of individual cells collected from a 3.14 km-deep boreho le\nin the Tau Tona mine, which is located near the site where Ca.\nD. audaxviatorMP104C was obtained. We sequenced ﬁve single\nampliﬁed genomes (SAGs) carrying SSU rRNA gene sequences\nwith >99.5% identity to MP104C. Our results show that, despite\na highly stable environment and extremely low cell abundance ,\nmicrobial populations still engage in horizontal gene transfe r, a\nprocess usually believed to be a strategy for fast adaptations to\nchanging environmental conditions.\nMaterials and Methods\nField Sample Collection\nFor single cell genomics, water samples were collected from\nthe borehole DPH5057-TT109-Bh1 in the Tau Tona gold mine,\nlocated in the north margin of the Witwatersrand Basin, near\nCarletonville, South Africa, at 3.14 km depth below the sur-\nface. This borehole penetrated ∼25 m ahead of a tunnel that\nwas advancing through the seismically-active, Pretorius Fa ult\nZone (\nHeesakkers et al., 2011 ) when it struck fracture water. The\nlow microbial abundance (8000 cells mL −1), elevated pH (8–9)\nand temperature (48–49 ◦C), and high reductive potential (340–\n370 mV) in the collected Tau Tona fracture water were typical o f\nthe deep subsurface of the Kaapvaal Craton ( Magnabosco et al.,\n2014); while the 14C content of the DIC suggested a subsurface\nresidence time of ∼21 kyr (Supplementary Table 1).\nAn acid-washed, autoclaved stainless steel manifold with m ul-\ntiple sampling ports was connected to the valve that had been\ninstalled on the borehole by the mine. Sampling ports had a\nvalve to adjust water ﬂow rate to meet various sampling requir e-\nments. The port was opened to ﬂush out the water for ∼5 min\nbefore any sampling activities were undertaken. Unﬁltered bor e-\nhole water was collected in a 50 mL Falcon tube and transported\nto the laboratory on ice. Within 6 h, 1 mL aliquots were trans-\nferred to cryovials containing glyTE cryoprotectant (5% glycer ol\nand 1x TE buﬀer pH 8.0, ﬁnal concentrations), mixed gently, and\nkept frozen at −80◦C until processing.\nSingle Cell Sorting, Whole Genome Ampliﬁcation,\nSequencing, and Assembly\nSingle cell sorting, whole-genome ampliﬁcation, PCR-\nampliﬁcation and sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal\nRNA (SSU rRNA) genes, as well as the shotgun sequencing\nand de novo assembly of the selected SAGs were performed\nat the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center\n(scgc.bigelow.org), as described previously (\nStepanauskas and\nSieracki, 2007; Swan et al., 2011; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2 012;\nField et al., 2015 ). PCR-ampliﬁed SSU rRNA gene sequences\n(∼800–900 bp) of SAGs were edited using Sequencher v4.7 (Gene\nCodes) and compared with previously deposited sequences using\nthe RDP v10 Classiﬁer (SSU rRNA) (\nWang et al., 2007 ) and\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAS T\n(Altschul et al., 1990 ) nucleotide database (nt). Using SINA\n(Pruesse et al., 2012 ), the SAG SSU rRNA gene sequences were\naligned with sequences selected with the RDP Seqmatch (SSU\nrRNA gene sequences from isolates, ≥1200 bp of good quality)\nfrom the RDP pipeline (\nCole et al., 2014 ). A maximum likelihood\ntree of the SAG SSU rRNA gene sequences (100 bootstrap repli-\ncates) was constructed using phyML v3.1 (\nGuindon et al., 2010 )\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 349\nLabonté et al.

Five SAGs having SSU rRNA genes with\nmore than 99.5% identity to that of Ca. D. audaxviator were\nselected for genomic sequencing.\nComparison of Genomes and Identiﬁcation of\nUnique SAG Genes\nAverage nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using JSpec ies\n(\nRichter and Rosselló-Móra, 2009 ) with the ANIb parameters.\nComparisons of putative proteins from SAG genes were per-\nformed with MUMmer using the promer algorithm (\nDelcher\net al., 2002 ). The SAGs were compared to each other and to the\nmetagenomic assembly Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C (GenBank\naccession number NC_010424). Contigs that were similar to t he\nMP104C genome but contained gaps were manually inspected\nand aligned using the Geneious Aligner (Biomatters, Auckla nd,\nNew Zealand) with a cost matrix of 70% similarity (5.0/-4.0) to\nidentify the speciﬁc regions of putative horizontal gene tran s-\nfer. Gene annotations from the Integrated Microbial Genomes\n(IMG) (\nMarkowitz et al., 2009, 2012 ) pipeline (http://img.jgi.doe.\ngov) were used to identify transferred genes and possible mode s\nof horizontal gene transfer (tRNA recombination, transposit ion\nand homologous recombination).\nFunctional Classiﬁcation of Proteins\nThe predicted genes were translated and used to search agains t\nthe NCBI non-redundant database (nr). The protein functions\nwere classiﬁed with the COG analyzer (\nTatusov et al., 2000 ) in\nMEGAN5 (Huson et al., 2011 ), where each “gene” was considered\na “read.” Transposases were identiﬁed using the IMG annota-\ntions, and classiﬁed with the ACLAME database (\nLeplae et al.,\n2004).\nMetagenomic Fragment Recruitment\nPreviously published metagenomes from boreholes in Tau Tona\n(\nLau et al., 2014; Magnabosco et al., 2014 ), Mponeng ( Chivian\net al., 2008 ), and Masimong ( Lau et al., 2014; Magnabosco et al.,\n2014) gold mines were used to look at the geographic distribu-\ntion of Desulforudis (Supplementary Table 2). BLAST + v2.2.28\n(Camacho et al., 2009 ) was used to recruit metagenome reads to\neach SAG assembly using BLASTn with default parameter val-\nues, except for the following: -evalue 0.0001 -soft_masking true\n-lcase_masking -xdrop_gap 150. Fragment recruitment resul ts,\nalong with whole genome comparisons were displayed using\nCircos v0.66 (\nKrzywinski et al., 2009 ).\nCalculation of HGT Rate\nProtein sequences from each sequenced SAG were compared\nwith the NCBI nr database using BLASTp with an e-value cut oﬀ\nof 0.001, and the results were searched for “paradoxical” bes t hits,\ni.e., best hits to homologs not in Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C,\nas in\nKoonin (2001) . All automatically detected “paradoxical”\nbest hits were manually checked to eliminate possible false\npositives.\nPhylogenetic Analysis of the Virion\nMorphogenesis Protein\nAnalysis of the gene content of the SAGs revealed a trans-\nposable phage in SAG AC-310-N13. Sequences similar to the\nvirion morphogenesis protein of the phage were obtained via\nBLASTx against the NCBI non-redundant database (nr). Pro-\ntein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (\nEdgar, 2004 ), and\nthe alignment was manually edited in Geneious ( Kearse et al.,\n2012). Phylogeny was performed using phyML ( Guindon et al.,\n2010) implemented in Geneious with 100 bootstrap replicates\nand the LG model with a gamma distribution ( +G), estimated\nrates of variation among sites and a proportion of invariable s ites\n(+I). Trees were viewed with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac. uk/\nsoftware/ﬁgtree/).\nAccession Numbers\nThe annotated genomes are available in the Integrated Micro-\nbial Genomes database (https://img.jgi.doe.gov) under the I MG\nTaxon ID numbers 2596583550 (AC-310-A06), 2596583551 (AC-\n310-E02), 2600254919 (AC-310-N13), 2596583553 (AC-310-\nO10), and 2596583554 (AC-310-P15).

This percentage was slightly lowe r than\n19–39% obtained from marine (\nSwan et al., 2011 ) and freshwater\n(Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012 ) bacterioplankton using the same\ntechniques. The retrieved SSU rRNA gene sequences revealed\nSAGs belonging to Firmicutes (43 SAGs), Nitrospirae (8 SAGs)\nand Bacteroidetes (1 SAG) ( Figure 1). The SSU rRNA genes\nformed 10 clusters with >99% sequence identity to each other\nand to sequences that were previously retrieved from diverse\nsubsurface environments ( Figure 1). Of the 52 identiﬁed SAGs,\n25 contained SSU rRNA genes that were 99.5-100% identical to\nthat of Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C. This shows that close rel-\natives of Desulforudis inhabit multiple subsurface environments\nand can coexist with other microbial species, in support of prior ,\nmetagenomic evidence (\nMoser et al., 2003, 2005a; Lin et al.,\n2006).\nOf the ﬁve Desulforudis SAGs that were genomically\nsequenced, AC-310-E02 and AC-310-O10 had SSU rRNA genes\nthat were 100% identical to MP104C, while AC-310-A06, AC-\n310-N13, and AC-310-P15 had SSU rRNA genes that were 99.5%\nidentical to MP104C. Between 66 and 129 kbp of DNA sequence\nwas recovered from each SAG in contigs larger than 2 kbp, corre -\nsponding to 4–8% of the expected genome size ( Table 1). This\nSAG genome recovery was signiﬁcantly lower ( p < 0.001, t-\ntest) than the 55% average genome recovery reported in a recen t\nsingle cell genomics study of surface ocean bacterioplankton ,\nwhich employed comparable laboratory and computational pro-\ncedures (\nSwan et al., 2013 ).

NA, Not applicable.\nfrom Desulforudis SAGs may have been caused by multiple fac-\ntors, such as incomplete cell lysis; chemical interactions o f DNA\nwith other molecules that prevented ampliﬁcation; or ineﬃcie nt\nmultiple displacement ampliﬁcation resulting from the high GC\ncontent (61%) of D. audaxviator. Another plausible explanation\nis that the analyzed Desulforudis cells were endospores or other\nresting stages that were diﬃcult to lyse. Inside an endospore ,\nDNA is protected by small acid-soluble proteins (\nSetlow, 1995 )\nthat may not be denaturated with the alkaline lysis of the cel ls\nused in this study. Further support for this hypothesis is pro-\nvided by the presence of sporulation genes in Ca. D. audaxviator\nMP104C (\nChivian et al., 2008 ) and the unusually dim ﬂuores-\ncence of Tau Tona microbial cells with the SYTO-9 nucleic aci d\nstain (Supplementary Figure 1), which is typical for hard-walle d\nmicrobial resting stages ( Setlow et al., 2002 ). We are not aware\nof studies of microbial sporulation in the Kaapvaal Craton or\nother terrestrial subsurface environments. However, abou t half of\nthe microbial cells within deep marine sediments are reporte d to\nbe in a dormant state (\nLennon and Jones, 2011; Lomstein et al.,\n2012; Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013 ). Some regions of MP104C\nappear to be preferentially recovered in SAGs (inner circles in\nFigure 2). A possible explanation is that DNA follows a spe-\nciﬁc folding pattern inside cells or endospores, with only som e\ngenome regions being accessible to MDA. Another plausible\nexplanation is preferential recovery of low %GC regions in SAGs .\nThe lower %GC of the SAG assemblies (54–56% GC) relative to\nthe 61% GC of the MP104C genome is consistent with the latter\nhypothesis.\nGenome Content Variation among Desulforudis\nCells\nThe average nucleotide identity (ANI) among the ﬁve sequenc ed\nSAGs and the MP104C genome ranged between 88.5 and 99.9%\n(Supplementary Table 3). This demonstrates a signiﬁcant dive r-\ngence of homologous genome regions among the analyzed Desul-\nforudis cells, despite their 16S rRNA genes being ≥99.5% identical\nto each other. Interestingly, 10 SAG contigs (out of a total o f 62)\nhad no homology to MP104C (Supplementary Table 4). Another\n22 SAG contigs contained both conserved and novel genome\nregions, when compared to MP104C (showcased as links in\nFigure 2, and Supplementary Figure 2). The signiﬁcant recruit-\nment of metagenomic fragments from Tau Tona but not Mpo-\nneng and Masimong by some of the SAG-speciﬁc genome regions\ndemonstrated their geographic endemism (asterisks in Figure 2\nand Supplementary Table 5).\nBetween 0 and 32% of genes found in the sequenced\nSAGs were absent in the Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C genome\n(Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that they are products of\nhorizontal gene transfer (HGT). In other taxa of Firmicutes ,\nsuch as Bacillus subtilis and B. halodurans, the percentage of\nnewly acquired genes has been estimated to ∼9%, while rates of\nup to 20% have been observed in Spirochaetes (\nKoonin, 2001 ).\nThe majority of SAG genes (80%) with no homology to Ca.\nD. audaxviator MP104C were similar to genes found in other\nFirmicutes, such as Desulfotomaculum sp. and Pelotomaculum\nsp. (Figure 3). Interestingly, many of these novel regions were in\nclose proximity to transposases (9 cases), tRNA (2 cases), reco m-\nbinases (2 cases), CRISPRs (1 case), and a prophage (1 case), all\nof which are indicative of recombination and HGT (\nOchman\net al., 2000; Gogarten et al., 2002; Brüssow et al., 2004; Mar raf-\nﬁni and Sontheimer, 2010 ) (Supplementary Figure 2, and Sup-\nplementary Table 7). These results indicate a high prevalence of\nHGT events among autochthonous bacterial populations of the\ndeep subsurface, despite their extremely slow metabolism and\ngeneration times that can be hundreds to thousands of years\n(\nPhelps et al., 1994; Jørgensen and D’Hondt, 2006; Lin et al.,\n2006).\nThe recovered regions of the ﬁve sequenced SAGs encoded\nfor 20 transposases, representing 3.6% of all genes (Supplemen-\ntary Table 8). The MP104C genome encodes 35 transposases,\naccounting for only 1.5% of all genes, which is still above the\n0.83% average found in all sequenced microbial genomes and\nmetagenomes (\nAziz et al., 2010 ). This suggests that transposi-\ntion may be signiﬁcant in the evolution of Desulforudis natural\npopulations. Transposases are among the most abundant genes\nin nature (\nAziz et al., 2010 ) and are best known for their role in\nthe HGT of antibiotic resistance genes ( Scott, 2002; Whittle et al.,\n2002) and the relocation of regulatory elements ( Shapiro, 2010 ).\nThe only other study of transposase genes in a subsurface envi -\nronment that we are aware of, in the Lost City deep hydrother-\nmal system, also found an unusually high abundance of these\ngenes, with more than 8% of metagenomic shotgun reads hav-\ning a signiﬁcant similarity to transposases (\nBrazelton and Baross,\n2009).\nTo identify the genes that may have been acquired by trans-\nposition, we looked at neighborhoods of transposases on the\nSAG contigs and classiﬁed them based on their COG func-\ntion (Supplementary Table 9). Most of the genes (57%) were\nnot assigned or had no hits to the database. Intriguingly, mo st\nidentiﬁed genes were involved in signal transduction (30%\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 349\nLabonté et al.

This suggests\nthat transposition in Desulforudis populations may be primar-\nily involved in the evolution of regulation and communicati on\nrather than new metabolic capabilities.\nThe apparent prevalence of HGT in an environment with\nextremely low cell abundance and slow growth is puzzling. A\nplausible explanation may be provided by the possibility that\nbioﬁlm-associated rather than free-living cells dominate sub-\nsurface microbiome (\nTaylor and Wirsen, 1999; Cozzarelli et al.,\n2007). Densely populated bioﬁlms may provide microenviron-\nments that enhance horizontal gene transfer ( Molin and Tolker-\nNielsen, 2003 ) and may serve as a source of cells and spores to\nthe fracture water that was analyzed in this study. Further s tudies\nare required to determine the presence and role of bioﬁlms in t he\nWitwatersrand Basin.\nSignatures of Desulforudis Interactions with\nPhages and Mobile Genetic Elements\nTwo contigs in AC-310-N13 (NODE_2 and NODE_13)\ncontain phage-like sequences with no homology to MP104C\n(Supplementary Table 4).

Very few transposable phages\nhave been isolated and sequenced to date. However, a recent\nre-analysis of genomic databases has revealed Mu-like prophag es\nwithin the genomes of several Firmicutes and Proteobacteri a\n(\nToussaint, 2013 ). The virion morphogenesis protein in AC-\n310-N13 is distantly related to prophages in other subsurface\nbacteria and non-subsurface Firmicutes, indicating co-ev olution\nof these phages and their hosts (Supplementary Figure 3).\nThe low nutrient concentrations observed in the deep subsur -\nface are expected to be unfavorable for lytic phage infections\n(\nFuhrman, 1999 ). Therefore, lysogeny may be the preferred\nlifestyle for deep subsurface phages. At least one prior study\nhas indicated the prevalence of lysogeny in deep hydrotherma l\nvents (\nWilliamson et al., 2008 ). A selective advantage of lyso-\ngenic phage-host systems may be the immunity induced by\nthem against other phages (\nCanchaya et al., 2003 ). Prophages\nsometimes increase the ﬁtness of their host through lysogen ic\nconversion or the transfer of useful genetic information ( Brüs-\nsow et al., 2004 ). To the best of our knowledge, our study is\nthe ﬁrst to demonstrate the presence of transposable phages\nin the deep subsurface and their interactions with indigeno us\nmicroorganisms.\nWe detected a CRISPR and associated cas genes in AC-\n310-E02 (Supplementary Figure 4). The same loci were also\npresent in the MP104C genome, with some diﬀerences in the\nCRISPR spacers. Three additional CRISPR loci were also present\nin MP104C.

Retrons are small genetic ele-\nments that encode for a reverse transcriptase (RT) similar to\nthe RT found in retroviruses and other retroelements. Retron s\nremain poorly characterized, but are found in many bacterial\ngenomes and could play a role in the evolution and ﬁtness of the ir\nhost (\nLampson et al., 2005; Simon and Zimmerly, 2008 ). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst record of retrons in de ep\nsubsurface environments.\nConclusions\nOur study conﬁrms that close relatives ( >99.5% identity of\nthe 16S rRNA gene) of the ﬁrmicute Candidatus Desulforudis\naudaxviator inhabit multiple deep subsurface fractures of the\nKaapvaal Craton in South Africa. Unexpectedly, we found that\nD. audaxviator coexists with other bacterial species and under-\ngoes frequent horizontal gene transfer and viral infection s.\nOur ﬁndings of a prophage, a retron, multiple CRISPRs and\nrestriction-modiﬁcation systems, and an unusually high fre -\nquency of transposases suggest that recombination, HGT and\nviral infections may play a role in the evolution of indigenou s\nmicroorganisms in the deep subsurface, despite their extrem ely\nlow cell abundance, slow metabolism and long generation times .\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.

Under\nanaerobic conditions in the absence of msDNA, proteins of central anaerobic metabolism\nneeded forSalmonella colonization of the intestine are dysregulated. We show that the\nmsDNA-deficient mutant can utilize nitrate, but not other alternate electron acceptors in\nanaerobic conditions. Consistent with the availability of nitrate in the inflamed gut, a neutro-\nphilic inflammatory response partially rescued the ability of a mutant lacking msDNA to colo-\nnize the intestine. These findings together indicate that the mechanistic basis of msDNA\nfunction duringSalmonella colonization of the intestine is proper production of proteins\nneeded for anaerobic metabolism. We further conclude that a natural function of msDNA is\nto regulate protein abundance, the first attributable function for any msDNA.

This molecule is produced by a reverse transcriptase and has no\nknown natural function despite more than 30 years of study. We report that msDNA is\nimportant for bothSalmonella Typhimurium and an enteropathogenicE. coli, two patho-\ngens that cause diarrhea in susceptible hosts, to survive in the intestine. Using mutant\nstrains incapable of producing msDNA, we show that msDNA is needed forSalmonella to\ngrow in the absence of oxygen. Mutants grown in oxygen-deficient conditions have sub-\nstantial changes in overall protein composition, including numerous proteins known to be\nimportant for anaerobic metabolism and growth in the intestine. Our findings link\nmsDNA to the ability ofSalmonella to thrive in an oxygen-deficient environment similar\nto the conditions inside the gut. We report that msDNA regulates the quantity of proteins,\nthe first natural function attributed to this molecule. msDNA may represent a new class of\nregulatory molecules.\nIntroduction\nRetron reverse transcriptases (RT) in bacteria were first described inMyxococcus xanthus[1]\nand E. coli [2] in the 1980s and are now known to be widely distributed in the genomes of\neubacteria and archaea (reviewed in [3]). All retrons contain three regions essential for produc-\ntion of msDNA:msr (RNA primer for reverse transcription),msd (template sequence), and a\nreverse transcriptase (RT). The retrons of pathogens, such asSalmonella Typhimurium (STm),\nmay also encode an additional ORF of unknown function [4]. The product of the‘retron’is a\nsmall covalently linked RNA-DNA hybrid molecule called multicopy single-stranded DNA\n(msDNA) that is predicted to form complex secondary structures [5]. The predicted secondary\nstructures of msDNA from enteric pathogens including STm, enteropathogenicE. coli and Vib-\nrio spp. are similar [4] but the reverse transcriptase amino acid sequence from these enteric\npathogens share little identity. The location of the retron as well as the number of retrons in\neach species varies. These observations suggest that retrons have been horizontally acquired by\nconvergent evolution to function in a fashion that is specific to the biology of the host\nbacterium.\nAlthough the molecular details of the production of msDNA have been heavily studied, no\nnatural function has been attributed to this mysterious molecule despite 30 years of study\n(reviewed in [3]). A critical obstacle to elucidating the natural function of msDNA was the lack\nof any phenotype for mutants unable to make this molecule. We have shown that the retron\nreverse transcriptase encoded bySTM3846 is essential forSalmonella Typhimurium (STm) to\ncolonize the calf intestine [6], a natural model of enteric salmonellosis that recapitulates the\nearliest stages of human non-typhoidalSalmonella (NTS) infection. This was the first reported\nphenotype for a mutant lacking a retron reverse transcriptase.\nNTS are major threats to global animal and human health, causing more than 90 million\ncases of gastroenteritis in people worldwide [7]. Human enteric salmonellosis is characterized\nby inflammatory diarrhea containing primarily neutrophils. To efficiently colonize the host,\nNTS use the type 3-secretion system 1 (T3SS-1) encoded onSalmonella Pathogenicity Island-1\n(SPI-1) to invade the intestinal epithelium [8,9] and to promote the characteristic neutrophilic\ninflammatory response. The host inflammatory response givesSalmonella a competitive\nadvantage over resident microflora. Within the intestinal lumen, the product of the neutro-\nphilic oxidative burst generates tetrathionate from oxidation of thiosulfate [10].

Effectors of the TTSS-1\nmay directly activate epithelial production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) thereby\ncreating nitrate, an additional terminal electron acceptor [11]. The relative importance of\nnitrate during infection is illustrated by the fact that it is a powerful chemoattractant forSalmo-\nnella during anaerobiosis [12]. In addition,Salmonella uses host-derived nutrients such as eth-\nanolamine [13] during intestinal inflammation. These strategies facilitate the growth of\nSalmonella in the complex microbial community of the intestine.\nWe used the enteric pathogen,Salmonella Typhimurium, to dissect the function of\nmsDNA. In the work described here, we report that mutants lacking msDNA produced by\nthe STM3846 reverse transcriptase are defective for colonization of the intestine using\nmurine models of salmonellosis. This colonization defect is due, in part, to a growth defect\nfor these mutants in anaerobic conditions. We show that mutants lacking msDNA have\naltered abundance of over 200 proteins in anaerobiosis, many of which are known to be\nrequired for growth in anaerobic conditions and for the pathogenesis of STm during enteric\ninfection. Inappropriate abundance of proteinsencoding alternate terminal electron acceptor\nreductases results in an inability of mutants lacking msDNA to utilize these compounds,\ninhibiting anaerobic growthin vitro. The mutants lacking msDNA can only utilize nitrate as\nan anaerobic terminal electron acceptor. Mutants lacking msDNA fail to colonize portions of\nthe intestine lacking substantial neutrophilic inflammation, likely due to the ability to only\nutilize nitrate to support anaerobic growth. Finally, we report a similar defect in intestinal\npersistence for an enteropathogenicE. coli lacking its retron reverse transcriptase suggesting\nthat msDNA is critical for enteric pathogens to thrive in the intestine of mammalian hosts.\nThus, we report a role in regulating protein abundance for msDNA, the first reported natural\nfunction for any msDNA. msDNA may represent a new class of bacterial regulatory\nmolecules.\nResults\nmsDNA is critical for STm intestinal colonization\nRetron reverse transcriptases, including theSTM3846 reverse transcriptase of the St-85 retron,\nuse msr to prime reverse transcription of themsd template sequence to produce msDNA [14]\n(Fig 1A). We generated a non-polar deletion ofmsd to establish that msDNA, and not some\nother potential product of the STM3846 RT, mediates STm colonization of the intestine.\nNeither theΔSTM3846 mutant nor theΔmsd mutant produce msDNA and its production\ncan be restored in both mutants by complementationin trans(Fig 1B). The additional ORF,\nSTM3845, is dispensable for msDNA production.\nWe used the murine colitis model [15], which responds to NTS infection with profound\nneutrophilic inflammation in the cecum, to dissect the function of the retron in intestinal colo-\nnization. We confirmed the requirement forSTM3846 in colonization of the inflamed intestine\nin this model (Fig 1C). In addition, both theΔmsd and ΔSTM3846 mutants have indistinguish-\nable phenotypes, suggesting that the effect of deletion of the RT is mediated by the msDNA\nitself. The ability of each of these mutants to colonize the intestine is rescued by complementa-\ntion in trans(Fig 1C and 1D). In cell culture, only theΔmsd mutant invades epithelial cells at a\nlevel mildly reduced compared to the isogenic wild type (S1 Fig) suggesting that reduced tissue\ninvasion is unlikely to be the cause of the phenotype that we observed during infection of ani-\nmal models. Our findings definitively link msDNA to the ability ofSalmonella to colonize the\nintestine.\nMulticopy Single-Stranded DNA in Gut Colonization\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005472 September 14, 2015 3/2 4\nmsDNA and anaerobiosis\nThe intestine is a specialized and highly diverse niche. Oxygen tensions within the lumen\ndecline from the stomach to the colon [16,17], and there is a gradient of increasing oxygen ten-\nsion from the center of the lumen towards the epithelium [18]. Enteric pathogens must repli-\ncate in this hypoxic setting using both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways [19,20] and\nexpress genes necessary for virulence in order to compete with resident microflora and colonize\nthe host efficiently.\nTo determine whether the intestinal colonization defect of the STm msDNA mutants could\nbe due to an inability to grow in oxygen limited conditions, we measured the growth of our\nmutants in the absence of oxygen, a condition where the retron is highly expressed [21]. Both\nmutants unable to produce msDNA have severe growth defects in rich media in anaerobic con-\nditions (Fig 2A and 2B, S2 Fig), while the growth of these mutants in the presence of oxygen is\nFig 1. msDNA is produced bymsd and STM3846 and is essential forSalmonellato colonize the intestine.(A) Genomic context of the retron St-85\n(adapted from [6]).

The necessity for\nmsDNA during anaerobic growth is consistent with the inability of msDNA-deficient mutants\nto efficiently colonize the intestine.\nFig 2.

First, small RNAs are well known to have regulatory properties through base pairing with\nDNA or mRNA transcripts [22]. Second, substantial over-expression of msDNA from one\nstrain ofE. coli in a heterologous strain lacking a retron resulted in small changes in the prote-\nome [23]. To determine whether the msDNA produced by the St-85 retron might have regula-\ntory properties, we evaluated the proteome of the WT and msDNA-deficient mutants\n(ΔSTM3846 and Δmsd) at late exponential phase, a time when the retron is expressed and\nmsDNA is produced (Fig 1Band [24]), in both the presence and absence of oxygen. Of the\n1504 total proteins identified, no significant differences in protein abundance between the WT\nand mutants in the presence of oxygen were detected (Fig 3and S1 Table). This finding is con-\nsistent with previous findings that mutants lacking msDNA grow indistinguishably from the\nFig 3. Proteins needed for anaerobic metabolism are dysregulated in mutants lacking msDNA.WT (HA420),Δmsd (JE135), andΔSTM3846\n(HA1444) were incubated either with agitation or statically in an anaerobic chamber for 4 hours.

In addition, we noted that\nvery few proteins differ in abundance between theΔSTM3846 and Δmsd mutants, consistent\nwith the hypothesis that the reverse transcriptase and msDNA operate in the same biological\npathway.\nIn anaerobic conditions however, we identified 238 proteins that differed in abundance\nbetween the wild type and msDNA-deficient mutants (Fig 3and S1 Table). Forty-three per-\ncent of proteins with reduced abundance in the mutant were involved in amino acid and car-\nbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion (Table 1). Twenty-five\npercent of all proteins of altered abundance did not belong to a functional grouping\n(Table 1). The abundance of proteins encoded on SPI-1 was unchanged in the absence of\nmsDNA (Fig 3). Proteins necessary for motility were increased in abundance in anaerobically\ngrown msDNA-deficient strains (Fig 3). However, this apparent increase did not result in a\nTable 1.

The abundance of numerous proteins known to be important for anaerobic growth\nand intestinal colonization was significantly reduced (Fig 3and S1 Table), including proteins\nfor 1,2 propanediol utilization [25], ethanolamine utilization [13], anaerobic sn-glycerol-\n3-phosphate utilization [26], anaerobic vitamin B12 biosynthesis [27], and serine/threonine\ndegradation [28].\nNumerous proteins involved in reduction of anaerobic electron acceptors [29] were altered\nin abundance between msDNA mutants and wild type bacteria during anaerobic growth (Fig\n3). Proteins important for the reduction of thiosulfate (PhsAB) and sulfide (AsrC) were of low\nabundance (Fig 4[adapted from [30]] andS1 Table). In addition, proteins necessary for the\nreduction of DMSO (DmsA, STM4305.s) and fumarate (FrdA) were in low abundance in\nmutants lacking msDNA, although they did not meet our stringent criteria for statistical signif-\nicance. Expression of genes necessary to utilize alternate electron acceptors is often induced by\nthe presence of the electron acceptor [29] so the absence of a statistically significant reduction\nin some of these proteins is not surprising because these compounds were not present in the\ngrowth conditions we used. Interestingly, NapA, encoding the periplasmic nitrate reductase\n[29], was one of the proteins that was present in increased abundance in msDNA deficient\nmutants compared to the WT, and there was no change in the abundance of NarGH, one of\nFig 4.

These data are consistent with\nthe growth defect of our mutants in anaerobic conditions, and suggest that msDNA-deficient\nmutants have a severe dysregulation of proteins necessary for reduction of terminal electron\nacceptors needed during anaerobiosis.\nAnaerobic terminal electron acceptor utilization in msDNA mutants\nOur proteomic data predict that msDNA is critical for STm to produce proteins necessary for\nreduction of terminal electron acceptors critical for metabolism during anaerobic conditions.\nIn order to confirm that the reduced abundance of anaerobic terminal electron acceptor reduc-\ntases, as indicated by our proteomic data, has functional consequences, we tested the ability of\nthe addition of various terminal electron acceptors to rescue anaerobic growth of theSTM3846\nmutant. We found that providing the alternate electron acceptors fumarate, DMSO, or thiosul-\nfate to the culture media during anaerobic growth failed to restore growth of the strain lacking\nmsDNA to WT levels (Figs5B–5F, 6B and 6C). This finding makes sense, as our proteomic\ndata suggest that the enzymes that transfer electrons to these terminal electron acceptors dur-\ning anaerobic growth, thiosulfate reductase, sulfide reductase, fumarate reductase, and two\nDMSO reductases, are reduced in abundance in mutants that lack msDNA. However, the addi-\ntion of nitrate to culture medium rescued the anaerobic growth of the reverse transcriptase\nmutant (Figs5A and 6A). These data are consistent with our proteomic data showing that\nmutants lacking msDNA have adequate NarG and an increased amount of NapA allowing\nthese strains to use nitrate as a terminal acceptor for electrons during anaerobic growth.\nFig 5.

To determine whether the colo-\nnization defects we observed were dependent on a functional T3SS-1 and host neutrophilic\ninflammatory response, we performed competitive infection experiments between the virulent\nWT and theΔSTM3846 mutant both in the presence and absence of SPI-1 (Fig 7A). We\nobserved that aΔSTM3846 mutant colonizes the intestine poorly and associated organs. The\nmodest colonization defect may be due to an inability to utilize carbon and amino acid sources\nwithin the inflamed intestine [13], or due to poor growth compared with WT prior to the host\ninflammatory response. Interestingly, the colonization defect of theΔSTM3846 mutant in the\nmouse cecum was exacerbated in the absence of a functional T3SS-1, suggesting that a robust\ninflammatory response partially rescues mutants unable to produce msDNA (Fig 7A). Consis-\ntent with this finding both the small and large intestines, which lack appreciable neutrophilic\ninflammation (Fig 7C), are poorly colonized with theΔSTM3846 mutant in mice inoculated\nwith this strain alone (Fig 7B). In murine models that do not develop a neutrophilic infiltrate\nin the intestine in response to infection (murine typhoid model), theΔSTM3846 mutant also\ncolonizes poorly after oral infection (Fig 8A and 8B). Our results suggest thatSTM3846 is\nessential for STm to colonize the intestine, a defect that is partially rescued in the presence of a\nprofound host inflammatory response, supporting the necessity for intact anaerobic metabolic\npathways in intestinal colonization.\nmsDNA in enteropathogenicE. coli\nThe msDNA of STm is similar in predicted secondary structure to msDNA of other enteric\npathogens including enteropathogenicE. coli (EPEC; [4]), a close relative of STm. EPEC atta-\nches to the epithelial surface causing characteristic attaching and effacing lesions and a malab-\nsorptive diarrhea [32]. Despite the fact that the pathology caused by NTS and EPEC is distinct,\nboth organisms colonize the intestine and cause diarrheal illness in susceptible hosts. We\nhypothesized that the RT of EPEC O127:H6, a serotype previously shown to produce msDNA\n[33], is necessary for this organism to colonize the gut. To test this hypothesis, we generated a\nnon-polar deletion of the retron RT (ΔE2348C_3890) and performed competitive infections\nbetween this mutant and the WT. We found that an EPEC mutant lacking the RT fails to per-\nsist within the intestine of mice, both in the luminal contents and adherent to tissue (Fig 9).\nThis defect was reversed by complementationin trans(S4 Fig). These data suggest that the\nimportance of retron reverse transcriptases during intestinal infection is not restricted to sal-\nmonellae, and thus are likely to be more broadly applicable to enteric pathogens.\nDiscussion\nThe natural function of msDNA has remained elusive despite more than 30 years of study\n[1,2,5,34–38]. We describe the first phenotypes for any mutant lacking msDNA. Using the\nenteric pathogenS. Typhimurium, we show that msDNA produced by a retron reverse tran-\nscriptase is critical for efficient colonization of the mammalian intestine.

Identification of these phenotypes cre-\nates the first opportunity for detailed studies of the molecular function of msDNA since the\ndiscovery of these unique molecules. We further showed that STm msDNA directs coloniza-\ntion of the intestine through regulation of the abundance of proteins necessary for central\nanaerobic metabolism. Thus, our data suggest that the natural function of msDNA may be to\ncontrol protein abundance, the first natural function to be ascribed to any msDNA molecule.\nIn STm, msDNA is produced by the STM3846 reverse transcriptase usingmsd as a template\nsequence andmsr as a primer. The msDNA from STm has a predicted 85-nucleotide DNA\nstem with no mismatched base pairs and a 4-nucleotide loop, and an RNA portion with two\npredicted smaller imperfect stem loop structures [4]. The RNA and DNA portions of msDNA\nare covalently joined by a unique 2’5’phosphodiester linkage on a conserved guanine [39]. It is\nunclear whether the entiremsr RNA sequence remains in the mature STm msDNA. Consistent\nwith prior reports [34,39], we showed that both the RT andmsd are requirements for produc-\ntion of msDNA. The intervening ORF,STM3845, is dispensable for msDNA production. This\nis perhaps not surprising as the presence of another ORF in addition to the RT in retrons is rel-\natively rare, and appears to be more common on retrons borne by pathogens [4,40,41]. It has\nbeen suggested that the retron RT could produce a variety of different cDNA molecules if the\nsequence of the mRNA transcript is identical to that of the 5’end ofmsr [42]. However, we\nobserved similar defects in intestinal colonization and anaerobic growth of mutants lacking\neither the RT ormsd. These data suggest that it is msDNA, and not some other potential prod-\nuct of the RT, that mediates intestinal colonization of STm.\nPrevious attempts to evaluate the function of msDNA have used artificial systems, failing to\nidentify phenotypes for mutants lacking msDNA and to definitively identify the natural func-\ntion of these molecules [23,43–47]. When an msDNA from one strain ofE. coli with mis-\nmatched base pairs in the predicted DNA stem region is significantly overexpressed in a\nheterologous strain ofE. coli lacking its own retron, the frequency of spontaneous mutation\nwas increased due to sequestration of mismatch repair proteins [43,44,46]. Thus, the produc-\ntion of msDNA was thought to increase mutation frequency. However, no previous work has\ndemonstrated that deletion of msDNA from a bacterium naturally producing msDNA\ndecreases mutation frequency. We hypothesize that substantial over-expression of any mis-\nmatched DNA could increase mutation frequency by the same mechanism. Thus, this previous\nfinding may not illuminate the true function of msDNA in the cell.\nWhen mutants lacking the ability to make msDNA are grown without oxygen, 15% of all\nproteins we could identify were in altered abundance. However, no dysregulated proteins were\nidentified during aerobic growth, consistent with the lack of identifiable phenotypes in the\npresence of oxygen. Our proteomic data were generated using cultures grown for the same\nduration of time under varying growth conditions. Some of the differences in protein abun-\ndance may result because wild type and mutant that cannot make msDNA grow differently\nduring anaerobic conditions. However, our growth data suggest that the growth phase of the\nwild type and mutants unable to make msDNA are not dramatically different at the times we\nchose to collect samples for our analysis. Furthermore, the differences in protein abundance\nbetween the msDNA mutant and the wild type during anaerobic growth that we re-tested\nΔSPI-1 (HA964) vsΔSPI-1 ΔSTM3846 (JE25; n = 5; open squares) 4 days post-infection in the murine colitis\nmodel as described inFig 1.

We show that the growth of mutants that cannot make\nmsDNA, and that have reduced abundance of several alternate electron acceptor reductases\nneeded during anaerobic growth, cannot be rescued by addition of the cognate alternate elec-\ntrons. Furthermore, the msDNA mutant overproduces periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapA)\nand a wild type level of a second nitrate reductase (NarG). We show that these proteins and\nFig 8.

Prior reports suggest\nthat the DNA portion of msDNA can be engineered to act as a regulatory molecule by creating\nan antisense sequence in the DNA loop [45]. Our data suggest that the natural function of\nmsDNA may be to act as a regulatory molecule although we have not yet identified specific reg-\nulatory targets.\nThere are two known master regulators of anaerobic metabolism in facultative anaerobes:\nfnr and arcA [48]. The transcriptional and protein profiles of anaerobically-grownSalmonella\nmutants deficient infnr and arcA are established [49,50]. With few exceptions, the proteins of\naltered abundance in our proteomic data align poorly with genes regulated by eitherfnr or\narcA. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons across our proteomic data and\npublished transcriptional profiles of mutants grown in the absence of oxygen, because of pro-\ntein profiles with transcript abundance are not directly comparable. Our data raise the possibil-\nity that regulation by msDNA may represent an additional pathway to regulate the abundance\nof proteins necessary for anaerobic metabolism.

Reactive oxygen species produced by\nneutrophils oxidize thiosulfate to tetrathionate, a compound thatSalmonella, but not resident\nmicroflora, uses as a terminal electron acceptor [10]. Epithelial-derived nitrate also contributes\nto the growth ofSalmonella in the anaerobic conditions of the intestine by acting as a preferred\nelectron acceptor in these conditions [31]. Some nutrients, such as ethanolamine, are used only\nduring the neutrophilic inflammatory response [13]. We have shown that some of these pro-\ncesses in STm are altered in mutants unable to produce msDNA, along with many other pro-\nteins with less clearly defined roles in pathogenesis.\nWe also observed a defect in intestinal persistence of an EPEC mutant lacking its retron RT.\nSalmonella entericaand E. coli are close phylogenetic relatives and both cause diarrheal illness\nin susceptible hosts, but there are critical differences in the retron between organisms. The RT\nof EPEC O127:H6 is located in a different genomic context than the retron of STm and has a\nGC content of 51.8%, similar to the average GC content of 50.6% [51] suggesting that this gene\nwas not acquired recently. This GC content in the EPEC retron is in contrast to the GC content\nof the retron of STm, 30.6% compared with the average GC content of 52.4% [4,52]. Unlike\nSTm, the retron of EPEC O127:H6 lacks an additional ORF. The predicted secondary struc-\ntures of msDNA from EPEC and STm are similar, however EPEC msDNA is predicted to have\nmismatched base pairs in the DNA stem [4]. Despite these differences, we report that EPEC\nmutants lacking the retron RT also have a phenotype during colonization of the intestine.\nCritical differences also exist between the pathogenesis of EPEC and STm diarrheal diseases.\nIn the intestine,Salmonella lives both in the lumen and invades the epithelium, replicating\nintracellularly and inducing a profound neutrophilic inflammatory diarrhea [53]. In contrast,\nEPEC attaches to the intestinal epithelium below the intestinal mucus in these regions of the\ngastrointestinal tract and remains extracellular [54]. Although our understanding of the molec-\nular mechanism of the development of diarrhea during EPEC infection is incomplete, this\ninfection causes a secretory diarrhea [32]. Thus, the mechanism of EPEC-induced diarrhea is\nsubstantially different than the inflammatory diarrhea caused by non-typhoidal salmonellae.\nOur data suggest that retron RTs are critical for colonization of the intestine by both of these\npathogens, yet the phenotypes of these mutants inSalmonella versus EPEC during infection\nare different. While the role of retron reverse transcriptases and msDNA in intestinal coloniza-\ntion by enteric pathogens is likely to be ubiquitous, we hypothesize based both on our data and\non the differences in diseases between these two organisms, that the processes regulated and\nthe regulatory targets themselves are likely to be different.\nWe show that a natural function of msDNA is to regulate protein abundance, the first\nreported natural function of any msDNA molecule. STm mutants unable to make msDNA\npoorly colonize the murine intestine. This colonization defect is due to altered abundance of\nnumerous proteins, including those necessary for central anaerobic metabolism, a process\nknown to be necessary for the ability of STm to colonize the intestine of mammals. We\nobserved that an EPEC mutant lacking its retron reverse transcriptase has a reduced ability to\npersist in the murine intestine, suggesting that the presence and function of msDNA may be\nbroadly applicable to other enteric pathogens. Retrons are also widespread in non-pathogenic\neubacteria (Reviewed in [3]) including most isolates of the environmental bacteriumMyxococ-\ncus xanthus[35]. msDNA is present in high copy per cell [1], suggesting that the regulatory\nfunction of this molecule is critical for the lifestyle of the host bacterium. It is puzzling that this\nmolecule appears to have a function under only certain conditions despite the fact that it is pro-\nduced in abundance. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that msDNA may sense\nMulticopy Single-Stranded DNA in Gut Colonization\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005472 September 14, 2015 16 / 24\nenvironmental changes in order to regulate gene expression. This hybrid RNA-DNA molecule\nrepresents an exciting new class of bacterial regulatory molecules with broad application to the\nunderstanding of the lifestyles of pathogens and non-pathogens alike.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains\nAll bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used for mutant construction are listed inS2 Table,\nS3 Table). AllSalmonella strains are derivatives of ATCC 14028s. EnteropathogenicE. coli\nO127:H6 strain E2348/69 [55], a generous gift of M. Donnenberg, is the genetic background\nfor all EPEC mutants described here. Mutants were constructed using a modification of the\nlambda-red recombination technique and antibiotic resistance cassettes removed as previously\ndescribed [56,57][ 58]. AllSalmonella mutations were moved into a clean genetic background\nby P22 transduction [59]. Standard cloning protocols were used to generate complementing\nplasmids [60].\nAll bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C aerobically with vigorous agitation or standing in\nan anaerobic chamber with internal atmosphere of 5% H\n2,5 %C O2, and 90% N2 (Bactron I,\nShelLab). For anaerobic growth experiments, bacteria were grown overnight aerobically then\ntransferred into the anaerobic chamber and diluted 1:100 into media pre-equilibrated for at\nleast 18 hours. Alternate electron acceptors (Sigma-Aldrich) sodium nitrate, sodium fumarate,\nsodium thiosulfate, and sodium tetrathionate were added to LB to a final concentration of\n40mM. Sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 40 mM served as a nega-\ntive control. DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to LB to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v).\nBacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB or MacConkey (Difco) agar supple-\nmented with the following antibiotics as appropriate: kanamycin (50 mg/L), nalidixic acid (50\nmg/L), carbenicillin (100 mg/L), streptomycin (100 mg/L), and chloramphenicol (20 mg/L).\nAll experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions. Bacterial generation\nnumber was calculated using the following equation: [log\n10(CFU final)— log10(CFU start)]/\nlog10(2).\nMouse infections\nEthics Statement: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in\nthe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Texas A&M University and North Carolina\nState University approved all animal experiments (protocol numbers 2012–084 and 2011–167\n(TAMU) and 14–132-B (NCSU)). All experiments that utilized mice were performed using\n8–12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories). For competitive infection experi-\nments, mice were infected by gavage with an equivalent ratio of WT and mutant bacteria. The\ncompetitive index was determined by dividing the ratio of WT to mutant bacteria in the\nselected organ by that ratio in the inoculum. For single infections, mice were infected with\neither WT or mutant bacteria. The harvested tissue was weighed, homogenized, and CFU was\ndetermined per gram of tissue collected.\nSalmonella infections were performed as previously described [15]. For the murine colitis\nmodel, mice were administered 20 mg streptomycin in 75μL sterile water by gavage. Twenty-\nfour hours after treatment, mice were infected with approximately 10\n8 CFU ofSalmonella in\n100 μL volume by gavage. Feces were collected 24 hours after infection. Mice were euthanized\nby carbon dioxide asphyxiation at 96 hours post-infection and organs harvested, homogenized,\nserially diluted, and plated on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics for enumeration of CFU.\nMulticopy Single-Stranded DNA in Gut Colonization\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005472 September 14, 2015 17 / 24\nFor the murine typhoid model, mice were treated with 75μL sterile water by gavage. Mice were\nthen infected and euthanized as above.\nEPEC mouse infections were performed essentially as previously described [61]. Mice were\ninfected with approximately 108 CFU in 100μL volume by gavage. Feces were collected every\nother day for 9 days. Mice were euthanized 10 days post-infection. The aboral 5 cm of small\nintestine, the entire cecum, and the entire colon were collected. Intestinal contents were\nexposed through a longitudinal incision. The intestinal segment was placed into sterile PBS\nand vigorously agitated to remove intestinal contents. Intestinal tissue was washed in sterile\nPBS to remove remaining ingesta. Intestinal contents and tissue were homogenized separately,\nserially diluted, and plated on MacConkey agar and LB agar with appropriate antibiotics to\nenumerate CFU.\nHistopathology\nSamples from mouse ileum, cecum, and transverse colon were collected 96 hours post-infec-\ntion and fixed in formalin. All tissues were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin\nand eosin. All histologic analyses were performed by a veterinary pathologist blinded as to\ninfection group. Tissues were scored (0–4) for each of the following parameters: polymorpho-\nnuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, mononuclear leukocyte infiltration, crypt abscess, submucosal\nedema, villus blunting, and epithelial damage as described [13,15,62,63].\nmsDNA isolation\nmsDNA was isolated from aerobic late log phase cultures normalized by OD600. Bacteria were\nlysed as for plasmid isolation (Qiagen Mini-prep) and msDNA isolated from the filtered frac-\ntion with subsequent ethanol precipitation. msDNA was visualized using a native polyacryl-\namide gel with in-gel ethidium bromide staining.\nInvasion assays\nCell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used within 15\npassages. HeLa cells (human cervical adenocarcinoma epithelial, ATCC CCL-2) were grown as\nrecommended by ATCC. HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 x 10\n4 cells/well approxi-\nmately 24 h prior to infection.\nLate-log phase cultures were prepared by inoculating 10 ml LB broth with 0.3 ml overnight\nshaking culture. Flasks were grown at 37°C with agitation for 3 hours. Bacteria were collected\nby centrifugation at 8000 x g for 90 seconds, resuspended in an equal volume of Hanks’buff-\nered saline solution (HBSS, Mediatech) and added directly to mammalian cells seeded in\n24-well plates for 10 minutes. The multiplicity of infection was approximately 50. Non-inter-\nnalized bacteria were removed by aspiration. Monolayers were washed three times in HBSS\nand were then incubated in growth media until 30 min post-infection. Thereafter, gentamicin\nwas added at 50μg/ml from 30–90 min p.i. to kill extracellular bacteria and reduced to 10μg/\nml from 90 min post-infection For enumeration of intracellular bacteria, monolayers were\nwashed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized in 0.2% sodium deoxycholate\nand serial dilutions were plated on LB agar.\nMotility assays\nSwimming motility was performed as previously described [64]. Swimming was assayed on\nplates containing 0.3% Difco Bacto Agar (LB agar base 25g/L). Plates were incubated either in\nopen air or in the anaerobic chamber overnight prior to use for swimming assays. Overnight\nMulticopy Single-Stranded DNA in Gut Colonization\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005472 September 14, 2015 18 / 24\ncultures of bacterial strains were grown at 37°C with agitation and cell numbers normalized by\noptical density. An aliquot of each normalized culture was transferred into the anaerobic cham-\nber. The WT,ΔSTM3846, andΔmsd mutants (3μl each) were spotted onto the same swimming\nagar plate and incubated at 37°C aerobically or anaerobically for 5 hours. The diameter of the\ncell spread was measured and compared with that of the WT on the same plate. Each assay was\nperformed in triplicate on three independent occasions (anaerobic) or in four replicates on two\nindependent occasions (aerobic).\nData analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. All data were log transformed\nprior to analysis. Statistical significance was set at P< 0.05 and was determined using a t-test\nor ANOVA where indicated.\nProteomic analysis\nAerobic overnight cultures of the wild type and theΔSTM3846 and Δmsd mutants were diluted\n1:100 and incubated either aerobically or in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) for 4 hours on three\nindependent occasions. Bacteria were pelleted and supernatants discarded. Cell pellets were\nresuspended in 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0 and lysed by vigorous vortexing in the presence of\n0.1 mm silica/zirconia beads. Proteins were denatured and reduced with 8M urea and 5 mM\ndithiothrietol, respectively, for 30 minutes at 60°C. The proteins underwent enzymatic diges-\ntion for 3 hours at 37°C with 1/50 enzyme/protein (w/w) ratio of sequencing-grade trypsin.\nThe resultant peptides were desalted for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis using C18 solid\nphase extraction cartridges (50 mg, 1 mL, Discovery, Supelco). The cartridges were activated\nwith methanol, followed by equilibration with 0.1% TFA before loading the samples. The car-\ntridges were then washed with 5% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA and eluted with 80% ACN/\n0.1% TFA. Eluted peptides were concentrated in the vacuum centrifuge and diluted to a con-\ncentration of 0.5 mg/mL with water for the MS analysis.\nDigested peptides were loaded into capillary columns (75μm x 35 cm, Polymicro) packed\nwith C18 beads (3μm particles, Phenomenex) connected to a custom-made 4-column LC sys-\ntem [65]. The elution was performed using the following gradient: equilibration in 5% B sol-\nvent, 5–8% B over 2 min, 8–12% B over 18 min, 12–35% B over 50 min, 35–60% min over 27\nmin and 60–95% B over 3 min. (solvent A: 0.1% FA; solvent B: 90% ACN/0.1% FA) and flow\nrate of 300 nL/min. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed either on an Orbitrap (LTQ Orbi-\ntrap Velos, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer using chemically etched nanos-\npray emitters [66]. Full scan mass spectra were collected at 400–2000 m/z range and the ten\nmost intense ions were submitted to low-resolution CID fragmentation once (35% normalized\ncollision energy), before being dynamically excluded for 60 seconds.\nTandem mass spectra were searched with MSFG+ againstSalmonella entericaserovar\nTyphimurium 14028s and common contaminant sequences (downloaded from NCBI, all in\nforward and reversed orientations), using the following parameters: (i) partial tryptic digestion,\n(ii) 50 ppm parent mass tolerance, (iii) methionine oxidation as a variable modification. The\npeptides were filtered with a MSGF probability score [67] /C201x10\n–9. Peak areas for each peptide\nwere retrieved using the MultiAlign tool [68], and to ensure the quality of peptide-to-peak\nmatching, the data was filtered with a Statistical Tools for AMT tag Confidence (STAC)\nscore /C210.7 and uniqueness probability/C210.5 [69]. Additionally, proteins were required to\nhave at least 2 peptides and at least one peptide with STAC/C210.9. Peptide abundance values\nwere log transformed and rolled-up into proteins using Qrollup tool, available in DAnTE [70].\nAbundance values for each protein across all 32 conditions (WT, mutants, anaerobic, aerobic\nMulticopy Single-Stranded DNA in Gut Colonization\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005472 September 14, 2015 19 / 24\nconditions, biological replicates, and technical replicates) were used to calculate a Z-score for\neach measurement where missing values were filled with 19.5.

Adapted from Wikipedia (https://en. \nwikipedia.org/wiki/Multicopy_single-stranded_DNA).\nCompiling Multicopy Single-Stranded DNA Sequences \nfrom Bacterial Genome Sequences\nWonseok Yoo, Dongbin Lim, Sangsoo Kim*\nDepartment of Bioinformatics and Life Science, Soongsil University, Seoul 06978, Korea\nA retron is a bacterial retroelement that encodes an RNA gene and a reverse transcriptase (RT). The former, once transcribed, \nworks as a template primer for reverse transcription by the latter. The resulting DNA is covalently linked to the upstream part \nof the RNA; this chimera is called multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), which is extrachromosomal DNA found in many \nbacterial species. Based on the conserved features in the eight known msDNA sequences, we developed a detection method \nand applied it to scan National Center for Biotechnology Info rmation (NCBI) RefSeq bacterial genome sequences. Among \n16,844 bacterial sequences possessing a retron-type RT domain , we identified 48 unique types of msDNA. Currently, the \nbiological role of msDNA is not well understood. Our work will be a useful tool in studying the distribution, evolution, and \nphysiological role of msDNA.\nKeywords: msDNA, retron, reverse transcriptase, RNA secondary structure\nIntroduction\nA retron is a 2-kb-long bacterial retroelement that carries \na promoter and three genes: msr, msd, and ret. The msr/msd \npart of the transcript is processed by a reverse transcriptase \nencoded by ret, resulting in an RNA/DNA chimera called \nmulticopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) [1]. The RNA \nand DNA parts of msDNA are encoded by msr and msd, \nrespectively. The precursor RNA molecule possesses a \npalindrome between the 5\n′ and 3′ ends, forming a double- \nstranded region between both ends (Fig. 1A). The 5′ part of \nthe palindrome is followed by a G residue, which is the \nbranching point for covalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B) \n[2]. The msr portion of the precursor RNA possesses two \nstem-loop structures, which are recognized by the reverse \ntranscriptase [3]. The msd part of the resulting chimera, \nshown in black in Fig. 1C, is palindromic, also forming a \nlarge hairpin structure.\nWhile msDNA is found in many bacterial species, its \nbiological role is not well understood. Furthermore, msDNA \nis not well annotated in public sequence databases. In order \nto facilitate the biological characterization of msDNA, we set \nout to compile msDNA sequences from known bacterial \ngenomes. Using a few known msDNA sequences, we \nextracted common sequence and structural features.

Their authenticity \nas msDNA needs to be confirmed experimentally.\nMethods\nPrototype msDNA sequences and their features\nWe used one of the published Escherichia coli msDNA \nsequences (GenBank accession No. U02551) [2] as the \nquery in a Basic Local Alignment Search T ool (BLASTN) \nsearch of NCBI GenBank High Throughput Genomic \nSequence (HTGS) division. From the BLASTN hits, we \nmanually curated seven other known msDNA sequences \n(Table 1). By visual inspection of these prototype msDNA \nsequences, several common features were recognized: (1) \nthe length of palindrome between the 5\n′ and 3′ ends ranged \nfrom 5 bp to 10 bp; (2) the distance between both ends \nranged from 140 bp to 200 bp; (3) the residues flanking the \npalindrome were conserved G residues in both strands; and \n(4) the distance between msr/msd and ret was less than 2 kb.\nWe developed a local python script that enforces these \nrules in the candidate retron sequences.\nGene prediction and protein domain search\nFrom the downloaded DNA sequences, genes were \npredicted with the GeneMark suite [4]. The input sequences \nwere split into 20-kb batches, and GeneMark was run for each \nbatch with the default settings. The predicted genes were \ntranslated into protein sequences, which were then scanned \nfor the Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) domain using \nReverse Position Specific (RPS)-BLAST . COG is a microbial \ndomain database distributed by NCBI. RPS-BLAST is one of \nthe BLAST applications distributed by NCBI and uses \nposition-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) as the target \ndatabase [5]. We looked for hits of the accession COG3344 \n(PSSM ID: 225881), which stands for “Retron-type reverse \ntranscriptase (mobilome: prophages, transposons).”\nPalindrome motif search\nOne of the characteristic features of msDNA is a \npalindrome formed by its 5′ and 3′ ends. In order to detect \nsuch a feature in the potential retron sequences, we used a \nlocal installation of the software tool palindrome in the \nEuropean Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) \nbioinformatics software package [6]. It requires several \noptions to be set. The minimum and maximum lengths of a \npalindrome and the maximum distance between a \npalindrome pair were set to 5, 10, and 200 bp, respectively, \nwhile the number of mismatches between a palindrome pair \nwas set to 1.\nProfile search of msDNA\nA multiple-sequence alignment of the eight prototype \nmsDNA sequences was generated with ClustalW (Fig. 2). \nWe then built a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile from \nthe multiple-sequence alignment using the software tool \nHmmerBuild in the HMMER package [7]. The potential \nretron sequences were screened using HmmerSearch with \nthe HMM profile [7]. The cutoff for a specific hit was \ndetermined by leave-one-out crossvalidation as follows: (1) \namong the eight seed sequences, one was set aside, and the \nremaining seven were used to build the profile; (2) what was \nset aside was then evaluated using the profile; (3) this \nprocess was repeated for each of the eight seeds, and the \nminimum score was defined as the cutoff (45.0).\nwww.genominfo.org 31\nGenomics & Informatics Vol. 14, No. 1, 2016\nFig. 2.

We used a local in-\nstallation of the software tool CentroidFold [8] to predict the \nsecondary structure of the msr/msd portion of the candidate \nretron. As the palindrome terminates with a G residue in \nboth strands, the 5\n′ of which is the branching point for \ncovalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B), sequences without \nthese G residues were removed. The web service version of \nRNAfold [9] was also used to visually confirm the final \nprediction set.\nResults\nCompilation of candidate retron sequences from \nknown genome sequences\nHistorically, msDNA has been discovered exclusively in \nbacteria. A keyword search of NCBI RefSeq bacterial \ngenomes with “reverse transcriptase” returned 34,637 hits, \nas of September 2, 2015. Following the gene prediction of \nthese genomes using GeneMark, a protein domain search for \n“Retron-type reverse transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, \ntransposons)” using RPS-BLAST resulted in 16,844 \ncandidate retron sequences. \nAlternatively, filtering out nonretron-type reverse tran-\nscriptase sequences can be also achieved by extracting \nprotein sequences from the RefSeq annotation, followed by \nthe domain search. Instead, we chose to predict genes from \nthe genome sequences using GeneMark, followed by the \ndomain search. Our approach does not rely on annotation \ninformation and has the potential to be applied to newly \nsequenced genomes as an independent tool.\nAutomatic filtration of candidate msDNA sequences\nThe candidate retron sequences identified above were \nfiltered by the presence of palindrome motifs. Using the local \npython script, we searched the 16,844 bacterial sequences for \npalindrome motifs 5–10-bp-long and separated by less than \n200 bp within 2 kb upstream of ret, yielding 7,428,332 such \nhits. These hits were then screened by the HMM models that \nwere developed based on the prototype msDNA sequences. \nThere were 3,865 hits surpassing the crossvalidation \nthreshold of 45.0. Using a local installation of CentroidFold, \nthe RNA secondary structures were predicted for the \nremaining hits, and those without the proper double-strand \npairing between the 5\n′ and 3′ ends were removed. Further-\nmore, those without the conserved flanking G residues were \nalso filtered out. The whole process, which was wrapped in a \nLinux shell script, resulted in 625 hits. \nManual curation and clustering of msDNA \nsequences\nThe final set of 625 candidate sequences that were \nidentified by an automatic process was highly redundant. The \nexact copies were pruned, giving rising to a set of 88 unique \nsequence types. As shown in Fig. 1A, the true msDNA should \npossess two hairpins in msr and a long hairpin in the msd \nregion. In order to confirm this complex overall topology of \nmsDNA, we examined the RNA secondary structure plots of \nthe 88 candidates visually. In fact, we removed 40 sequences \nthat did not form the appropriate overall topology. See Fig. 3 \nfor a few representative surviving examples. Among the \noriginal 625 sequences, 525 can be mapped to these 48 \n32 www.genominfo.org\nW Yoo, et al. Bacterial msDNA\nFig. 4.

From the \nresulting dendrogram, we recognized 20 groups by splitting \nthe tree at a branch length of between 0.12 and 0.20 (Fig. 4). \nThe species distribution of the 525 msDNA sequences over \nthe 20 groups is given in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1.\nwww.genominfo.org 33\nGenomics & Informatics Vol. 14, No. 1, 2016\nDiscussion\nWe developed a rule-based protocol to detect msDNA in a \ngiven genomic DNA sequence. The rule is based on the \npresence of a 5 –10-bp-long palindrome motif in the \nprecursor transcript that is less than 2 kb upstream of a \nretron-type reverse transcriptase gene. The rule is augmented \nby enforcing a sequence similarity with known msDNA \nsequences. This step is implemented with an HMM profile \nsearch method. While this was a powerful filtration step, \nreducing the hits by about 1/20, it would inevitably miss \nsome true msDNA sequences that are distantly related to the \np r o t o t y p e s  g i v e n  i n  T a b l e  1 .  A s  m o r e  d i s t i n c t  m s D N A  \nsequences are discovered, the panel of the seed sequences \nmust be updated. \nThe list of potential candidate msDNA sequences was \nfiltered by conformation to the known topology of the RNA \nsecondary structure. The RNA secondary structure pre-\ndiction programs usually output the result in terms of \nVienna dot bracket notation [9]. As the manipulation of the \nstring is not straightforward, some manual curation was \ninvolved. In the future, we will explore the possibility of \nautomatic implementation, which is critical for web-based \nservice of the prediction tool. T o our knowledge, this is the \nfirst large-scale annotation of msDNA in all publically \navailable bacterial genome sequences. As our work is \ncomputational in nature, the list we compiled can include \nsome false positives. Its authenticity should be validated \nexperimentally. Nevertheless, our list of msDNA sequences \nand their species distribution profile constitute a useful \nresource for the future study of msDNA, as its biological role \nis still elusive.\nSupplementary materials\nSupplementary data including one table can be found with \nthis article online at http://www.genominfo.org/src/sm/ \ngni-14-29-s001.pdf.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is based the Bachelor’s degree thesis of WY at \nSoongsil University, Seoul, Korea.

These technologies have\narisen from the redirection of natural biological ma-\nchinery, such as bacteriophage lambda proteins for\nrecombineering and CRISPR nucleases for eliciting\nsite-speciﬁc double-strand breaks. Less well-known\nis a widely distributed class of bacterial retroele-\nments, retrons, that employ specialized reverse tran-\nscriptases to produce noncoding intracellular DNAs.\nRetrons’ natural function and mechanism of genetic\ntransmission have remained enigmatic. However, re-\ncent studies have harnessed their ability to produce\nDNA\nin situ for genome editing and evolution. This\nreview describes retron biology and function in both\nnatural and synthetic contexts. We also highlight\nareas that require further study to advance retron-\nbased precision genome editing platforms.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe ability to precisely edit genomic loci has been a long-\nstanding goal of biotechnology. Targeted genome editing\nis being exploited to probe genotype-phenotype relation-\nships, repair disease-causing alleles, develop designer or-\nganisms with modified genomes, and to biologically record\nintra- and extracellular conditions. Classically, strain im-\nprovement has been achieved either via non-specific mu-\ntagenesis of genomes (1,2) or via targeted modifications\nof specific genes expressed on plasmids (3,4). Recombi-\nneering (5) and CRISPR-based genome editing (6,7)h a v e\ndramatically increased the ease and throughput of tar-\ngeting individual genomic loci. Multiplexing and iterating\nrecombineering- and CRISPR-based editing technologies\nhave enabled high-throughput exploration of genotype–\nphenotype relationships and continuous evolution of syn-\ntheticgenomeswithnovelproperties,forexampleinMulti-\nplexAutomatedGenomeEngineering(‘MAGE’)( 8),Yeast\nOligo-mediatedGenomeEngineering(‘YOGE’)( 9),andit-\nerative CRISPR EnAbled Trackable genome Engineering\n(‘iCREATE’) (10).\nRetronsareapotentiallyusefultoolfortargetedgenomic\nengineering because they produce intracellular DNAs\nvia reverse transcription of noncoding structural RNAs\n(11,12). While the natural biology of these widespread\nretroelements is largely unknown, retrons have recently\nbeen repurposed asinsitu sources of donor DNA for both\nrecombineering- and CRISPR-based genome editing ap-\nplications (13–15). This production of intracellular DNA\nhas so far enabled recording of cellular states (13), high-\nthroughputgeneticediting( 14),andtargetedgenomemuta-\ntion(15).Here,wereviewretronbiologyandretron-enabled\ngenome engineering applications. We conclude with a dis-\ncussion of future prospects and challenges in retron-based\ngenome editing.\nRETRON BIOLOGY\nRetron discovery and biochemistry\nRetrons were initially discovered in 1984 from the presence\nof short satellite RNA–DNA molecules in bacterial DNA\npreparations (16). Gel electrophoresis of phenol-extracted\nchromosomal DNA fromMyxobacteria xanthusand Stig-\nmatellaaurantica indicated a secondary satellite band with\na mobility of∼120–190 base pairs (bp) (16). Subsequent\nstudies revealed that these bands, termed multicopy single-\nstranded DNAs (msDNAs), are comprised of one strand\nof structured RNA, the ‘msr,’ connected to one strand of\nDNA, the ‘msd.’ The msr and msd molecules are joined by\na2\n′-5′ phosphodiester bond between a priming guanosine\nwithinaconservedAGCsequenceinthemsrandthephos-\nphateofthe5 ′ endofthemsdthatcovalentlylinkstheRNA\nand DNA strands into a single branched molecule (Figure\n1).Themsrandmsdareencodedinacompact,contiguous\ntranscriptional cassette that also includes a specialized re-\nversetranscriptase(RT);werefertothiscassetteasawhole\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The discovery of retron RTs was particularly\nnotable because they were the first discovered bacterially-\nencoded RTs (17). In vitrostudies demonstrated thatEs-\ncherichia coliretron RTs and their paired msrs were both\nnecessary and sufficient to produce msDNA with the char-\nacteristic 2′-5′ linkage (18,19). To date, 38 distinct retrons\nhave been identified experimentally by their production of\nmsDNA; 16 of these, which we subsequently refer to as the\n‘experimentally validated retrons’, contain fully annotated\nand experimentally-validated msr-msd-RT cassettes. Table\n1 summarizes all experimentally-characterized retrons re-\nported to date, along with their host organisms. Bioinfor-\nmatic approaches have also identified hundreds of puta-\ntiveretronsthathavenotbeencharacterizedexperimentally\n(20–22).\nThe rapid discovery of hundreds of putative retrons has\nprompted us to develop a systematic naming convention\nfor these retroelements. Currently, retrons are named by\nthe first letters of their genus name, species name, and the\nlength of reverse-transcribed DNA in their native msDNA\nsequence. This convention was initially developed by In-\nouyeetal. in1989,whotermedaretronisolatedfrom E.coli\nthat contained 86 bases of reverse-transcribed DNA ‘Ec86’\n(23). However, this nomenclature is not easy to adapt for\nlarge-scale,systematicretrondiscoveryforthreereasons:(i)\nthe length of the msd of most experimentally validated and\nputative retrons is unknown; (ii) two letters are insufficient\nto uniquely identify the genus and species of many retron-\nencoding bacteria; and (iii) the convention does not distin-\nguish the entire retron from the RT. Therefore, we propose\namoregeneralnamingconventionthatisadaptedfromthe\nrestriction enzyme literature (Table1)( 24).\nI. Retrons are named as the first letter of their genus, first\ntwo letters of their species, and an Arabic numeral cor-\nresponding to the order with which they were discov-\neredrelativetootherretronsfromthesamespeciesora\ndifferent species with the same first genus and first two\nspecies letters, respectively.\nII.

The msd-encoding\nsegment of the transcript is also highly structured, folding\nintoasinglehairpinwithalong( ∼10–50bp)stemthatgen-\nerally contains mismatched or wobble base pairs. In addi-\ntion to this internal structure of the msr and msd, the∼8–\n30 bases at the 5\n′ end of the msr and the 3′ end of the msd\ntranscript are complementary and hybridize (Figure1B).\nThe internal (e.g. 3′) and of the msr portion of this stem\ncontains or ends immediately 5′ to the conserved guano-\nsine residue that primes reverse transcription of the satel-\nlite DNA. Most commonly, this guanosine is found within\na conserved TAGC sequence, though occasionally this se-\nquence is CAGA (as in Retron-Eco2 (Ec67)), CAGC (as in\nRetron-Sau1 (Sa163) and Retron-Mxa1 (Mx162)), GAGC\n(as in Retron-Mxa2 (Mx65)) or ACGC (as in Retron-Vch2\n(Vc81)) (Figure1A, inset).\nThe RT initiates reverse transcription using the base-\npaired 5\n′ and 3′ stem of the msr-msd as a primer (12).\nEarly experiments demonstrated that severalE.coli retron\nRTs and their paired msrs are both necessary and suffi-\ncient to produce msDNA with the characteristic 2′-5′ link-\nage (18,19), and that the 2′-5′ linkage between the priming\nguanosine in the msr and first base of the msd DNA is cat-\nalyzed directly by the RT (26) .T h eR Te x t e n d st h er e v e r s e\ntranscript until a defined position at which reverse tran-\nscription stopsinvitro and invivo via an unknown mecha-\nnism.TheobservationthattheRTterminatesatsimilarsites\ninvitro andincellsstronglysuggeststhatRNAstructuredi-\nrects RT termination. Concurrently with reverse transcrip-\ntion,cellularRNAseHactivitydegradesthetemplateofthe\nmsd, excluding∼5–10 RNA bases at its 5\n′ end. This seg-\nment of the RNA remains hybridized to the complemen-\ntary reverse transcript and is thus be considered to be part\nof both the msr and msd (27)( F i g u r e1C). The mechanism\nlimitingRNAseHactivityatterminalmsdresiduesalsore-\nmains unexplored.\nRetron msDNA is further nucleolytically processed af-\nter reverse transcription (12,17,28,29). Often, some or all\nof the msr upstream of the conserved priming guanosine\nis degraded. For example, the Retron-Mxa1 (Mx162) ms-\nDNA is initially transcribed as a 241 nucleotide (nt) tran-\nscript. In the mature msDNA, 16 residues are cleaved from\nthe 5\n′ end, leaving a 71-nt msr and a 162-nt msd msDNA\n(the msr and msd overlap at 8 bases) (17). Other retrons\nundergo much more dramatic processing that results in a\nmaturemsDNAthatisprimarilyreversetranscribedDNA.\nFor example, msDNA-Eco4 (Ec83) is endonucleolytically\ncleaved between the fourth and fifth nucleotides from the\nprimingguanosineresidue,removingthatlinkagetothemsr\n(12,28).Thiscleavagelikelyresultsinthedissociationofthe\nbase pairs at the 3\n′ ends of the msd and msr, since 90% of\nexperimentally-observedmsDNA-Eco4(Ec83)isnotjoined\nto RNA (30). While the enzyme responsible for this cleav-\nageisnotknown,itmayarisefromaputativeATP-binding\nproteinencodedjustdownstreamofRT-Eco4(Ec83)inthe\nnative cassette.\nReversetranscriptionrequiresbothanmsr-msdsequence\nanditscognateRT.ExpressingtheRTofoneretronandthe\nmsr of another does not produce msDNA (31–33)), with\nsome exceptions for highly homologous retrons (34,35).\nMutational and Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Ex-\nponential Enrichment (SELEX) -based studies of Retron-\nEco1 (Ec86) and Retron-Eco3 (Ec73) indicated that both\nmsrsequenceandsecondarystructureareimportantforRT\nrecognition. While RT-Eco1 (Ec86) can bind moderately\ntruncated or modified variants of its cognate msr, remov-\ning or destabilizing a core section containing an 8 bp stem\nandathreebaseloopabrogatesbinding.Similarly,RT-Eco3\n(Ec73) binds a specific 9 bp stem, three base loop section\nof its cognate msr but fails to bind other msr truncations\n(32,36).\nReverse transcriptase structure and function\nRetron RTs form a diverse class within the broader fam-\nily of bacterial RTs (Figure2, Supplementary Figure S2).\nEarly estimates suggested that retrons encode 11–14% of\nall bacterial RTs, second only to Group II intron mat-\nurases (20,21). More recently, a metagenomic survey sug-\ngestedthatdiversity-generatingretroelements(DGRs)may\nbemorecommonthanretronsinuncultivatedbacteria( 37).\nNonetheless,retronRTsarequitecommonindiversebacte-\nria (see next section). Experimentally validated retron RTs\nshare just∼14% average amino acids (aa) homology with\ntheRoseburiaintestinalis Group II intron maturase RT do-\nmain, ∼12% with theBordetellabacteriophage DGRbRT\nRT, and∼25% homology with each other (Supplementary\nTable S1).\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates several distinct groups of\nretron RT sequences, which together form a group dis-\ntinct from RTs associated with both Group II intron mat-\nurases and DGRs (Figure2A). To identify the relation-\nship between retron RTs and other bacterial RTs we first\naligned the sequences of all 16 fully annotated retron RTs,\neight previously putatively identified retron RTs from tax-\nonomic groups lacking experimentally validated retrons,\nthree Group II intron maturase RTs, and theBordetella\nbacteriophage DGRbRT using NCBI’s Constraint-based\nMultiple Alignment Tool (COBALT) (38). We then built a\nphylogenetictreefromthesealignmentsusingtheGeneious\nTree Builder tool with the Jukes-Cantor genetic distance\nmodel and the neighbor-joining tree build method. In the\nresulting tree, retron RTs branch from the Group II intron\nmaturaseandDGRRTs.Notably,theputativeretronRTse-\nquences, which originated from genomes of bacteria in the\nBacteroidetes,Betaproteobacteria,Cyanobacteria,Fusobac-\nteria,a n dFirmicutes, and the archaeon Methanosarcina\nacetivorans(39),andtheexperimentallyvalidatedretronRT\nsequences, which originated only fromGammaproteobacte-\nria and Deltaproteobacteria, are clearly within this group\nseparate from other bacterial RTs. There are several clear\ngroupswithintheretronRTs.Onegroupcontainsthemyx-\nococcal RT-Mxa2 (Mx65), RT-Mxa1 (Mx162), RT-Nex2\n(Ne144) and RT-Sau1 (Sa163) and putative cyanobacte-\nrialretronRTsfrom Nostocpunctiforme andTrichodesmium\nerythraeum. Another group contains RT-Vch1 (Vc95), RT-\nEco4 (Ec83), RT-Vpa3 (Vp96), and RT-Eco7 (Ec78).

Most retron RTs are ∼300–400 aa long and lack\nbioinformatically identifiable endonuclease, maturase, or\nRNAse domains (Figure2C) (12,23). Several retron RTs\nalsoencodeadditionalN-andC-terminalextensionsofun-\nknownfunction.Forexample,myxococcalretronRTs(RT-\nMxa1 (Mx162), RT-Mxa2 (Mx65), RT-Sau1 (Sa163) and\nRT-Nex2(Ne144))containanextendedN-terminalregion.\nSimilarly,RT-Eco2(Ec67)is586residueslongandcontains\nboth N- and C- terminal extensions that lack homology to\nnon-retron protein domains.\nThe conserved RT motifs include the ‘palm’ and ‘fin-\ngers’ domains and the conserved double aspartic acid-\ncontaining catalytic core. Retron RTs encode the YADD\ncatalytic tetrad, as seen in Group II intron maturase RTs\nandotherbacterialRTs.Aswithotheraspectsoftheretron\nRTsequence,severalvariantsencodealteredcatalyticcores\n(e.g., YCDD in RT-Eco5 (Ec107), Supplementary Figure\nS2).Ofthetwoconservedretron-specificmotifs,regionXis\na∼16aasegmentthatisbetweenRTmotifs2and3( 21,22).\nFourteenofthe16experimentally-validatedretronRTscon-\ntainanNAXXHaasequenceinregionX.Thetwooutliers,\nRT-Eco6 (Ec48) and RT-Mxa2 (Mx65)), contain substitu-\ntions at the asparagine residue (Supplementary Figure S2).\nNotably, while both Group II intron and DGR RTs like-\nwise contain residues between motifs 2 and 3, they lack the\ncharacteristic NAXXH motif seen in retron RTs.

We conjecture that region X in retron RTs may\nlikewise stabilize the active site to promote catalysis.\nRegionYisa ∼90aasegmentattheC-terminusofretron\nRTs. Region Y is defined as beginning within motif 7 at\na highly conserved VTG triplet and extending to the C-\nterminal end of the protein (12,32). Fourteen experimen-\ntally verified retron RTs contain the VTG triplet; RT-Vch2\n(Vc81)andRT-Eco6(Ec48)containaV →IandT →Hsub-\nstitutions, respectively. Beyond the conserved VTG, region\nY is variable. Biochemical studies indicate that region Y\ndirects the RT to its cognate msr. Deleting region Y from\nRT-Eco1 (Ec86) and RT-Eco3 (Ec73) abrogated their abil-\nity to bind their msrs (32). Moreover, a purified C-terminal\nfragment of region Y of RT-Eco1 (Ec86) (residues 255–\n320) bound the stem-loop of msr-Eco1 (Ec86) with aK\nD\nof ∼5 × 10−8 M, as well as a shorter fragment containing\naneightbase-pairstemofthemsr-Eco1(Ec86)withathree\nbase UUU loop, but not the msr-Eco3 (Ec73). Likewise, a\npurified C-terminal fragment of RT-Eco3 (Ec73) contain-\ning its region Y (residues 251–311) bound the cognate msr-\nEco3 (Ec73) msr tightly (though the specificK\nD was not\nmeasured), but not msr-Eco1 (Ec86) msr (36). Swapping\nregion Ys between RT-Eco1 (Ec86) and RT-Eco3 (Ec73)\nproducedchimericproteinswith‘swapped’msrrecognition\n(32). However, all region Y studies to date have focused on\nRetron-Eco1 (Ec86) and Retron-Eco3 (Ec73). Additional\nbiochemical experiments will be required to confirm that\nregion Y broadly recognizes the stem of its cognate msr in\ndiverse retrons.\nAccessory open reading frames in retron cassettes\nApproximately a third of annotated retrons encode ac-\ncessory open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown func-\ntion (Figure 3A). These ORFs may be between the msr-\nmsd and the RT (e.g., in Retron-Eco3 (Ec73), Retron-Sen2\n(St85), and Retron-Vch2 (Vc81)) or immediately 3\n′ of the\nRT (e.g. in Retron-Eco4 (Ec83)). Some of these ORFs are\nputatively annotated as adenosine-binding proteins, (e.g.,\nin Retron-Eco4 (Ec83) (43)) or cold-shock proteins (e.g. in\ntheS.enterica EnteridisRetron-Sen1(Se72))( 44).Notably,\nsome of the retrons with accessory ORFs also produce un-\nusualmsDNAs.Forexample,Retron-Eco4(Ec83)produces\nsingle-stranded DNA via site-specific cleavage of its ms-\nDNA (45). Retron-Sen1 (Se72) shows an even more dra-\nmaticdeparturefromtheretronparadigm;the2\n′-5′ linkage\nisnotexperimentallyobserved( 44,46).Here,theRNAtem-\nplateisdegradedafterthefirstroundofRT,andthesingle-\nstranded DNA is used as a template to produce double-\nstranded DNA (dsDNA). RT-Sen1 uses the free 3\n′OH end\nof the msr to initiate the second round of DNA synthe-\nsis. Despite the unusual dsDNA product, RT-Sen1 (Se72)\nisstructurallyhomologouswithotherretronRTsequences.\nAlthoughitistemptingtospeculatethatthepresenceofac-\ncessory ORFs is important for producing unusual msDNA\nvariants, additional biochemical studies are required to de-\nfine their functions. These enigmatic ORFs may also pro-\nvideopportunitiesforbasicdiscoveryandbiotechnological\napplications.\nBiological distribution and transmission\nExperimental and bioinformatic studies indicate that\nretrons are sporadically distributed throughout the bacte-\nrial kingdom. Experimentally, msDNA has been isolated\nfrom a diverse subset ofAlpha-, Delta- and Gammapro-\nteobacteria(Table1)( 47). Screens of msDNA production,\nhowever,havecommonlyindicatedthatmsDNAisnotcon-\nsistently produced by all strains within these taxonomic\ngroups. Screens ofE. coliidentified msDNA in four of 89\nandsevenof113clinicalandenvironmentalisolates( 48,49).\nAnother study identified msDNA from 4 of 23Proteus\nmirabilisisolates;1of21 Klebsiellapneumoniae isolates,and\n10of63 Rhizobiaisolates(49).Incontrast,msDNAproduc-\ntion appears very common within the myxobacteria, with\nmsDNAfoundin27of28testedmyxobacterialstrains( 50).\nIn addition to these experimentally-identified retrons,\nbioinformatic surveys have identified putative retrons\nin Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes\n(39), Actinobacteria (21,51) and even in the archaeon\nMethanosarcina acetivorans(39). Typically, these studies\nfirst identify retron-specific RTs in gene or protein data-\nbanks (20,21), metagenomic data (52,53), or in newly-\nsequenced bacterial genomes (51,54). Recent studies have\nadditionally examined the regions upstream of the RT for\npalindromic and hairpin-containing motifs similar to msr-\nmsd regions of experimentally validated retrons (55,56).\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2019,Vol.47,No.21 11013\nmsdmsr RT\nORF\ndouble\nstranded msd\nStandard\nImmediately \ndownstream ORF\nex: Retron-Eco 4 \n(Ec83)\nInternal ORF\nex: Retron-Vch2 \n(Vc81), Retron- \nSen2 (St85)\nTwo ORFs, no \nclear msr\nex: Retron-Sen1 \n(Se72)  \nORFs req’d for\nmsDNA production\nProphage\n34 bp replaced\npyrE ttk\nProphage insertion\nIntergenic insertion: \nRetron-Eco5 (Ec107)\nPlasmid-bound: Retron-Sen1 (Se72)\nFlanking repeats\nIntegrase pseudogene\nFlanking repeatsSgiI genome island\n~42 kbp\n~4kbp\nAncient prophage:  Retron-Sen2 (St85)\n~180 bp replaced\nRetron-Eco1 \n(Ec86) + \nupstream \nORF\ncos\nRT = 963 bp\nRetron-Eco2 \n(Ec67)\nRT = 1761 bp\nor\nProphage ~ 34 kbp\nC\nyfcA orf160\nGGGGGG\nRetron-Vch1 \n(Vc95) + \ndownstream \nORFs\norf540 orf205 orf105\norf330Reton-Vch2 (Vc81)\n(-strand)\nor\nor\nRetron-Vc3 \n(Vc137) + \nupstream ORF\norf291\nAB\nFigure 3. Organization and genomic context of select retron cassettes. (A) Structures of representative validated retron cassette genes. The msr (blue),\nmsd (red), complementary repeat regions (yellow), and RT (purple), and associated unknown ORFs (green) are indicated. Many retron cassettes (‘stan-\ndard’) consist only of an msr and msd flanked by complementary regions upstream of an RT. Variations on this theme include ORFs either immediately\ndownstream of the RT or between the msr-msd and the RT. Retron-Sen1 (Se72) contains an msd that is transcribed in both directions to produce double-\nstranded DNA. A hairpin-containing ORF flanked by repeat regions may function as an alternative msr. The cassette also includes an RT and a second\nunknownORF with homology to cold shock proteins (46). (B) Genomic contexts of retron cassettes. Severalvalidated retrons occur in putative prophage\nsites flanked by repeat regions (12).

While retrons do not appear to encode elements\nthat support genetic mobility (e.g., RT endonuclease do-\nmains such as those required for the mobility of Group\nII introns), many are associated with mobile elements and\nprophage insertion sites (Figure 3B) (12). For example,\nRetron-Eco3 (Ec73) is inserted into a bacteriophage-like\nelement termed /H9272R73 integrated into the chromosomal\nselenocystyl-tRNA locus. Infection of/H9272R73-containing E.\ncoli cells with P2 phage produced infectious virions that\nlysogenized new host strains, resulting in the integration\nof /H9272R73 at the selenocystyl-tRNA locus and production\nof msDNA-Eco3 (Ec73) (57,58). Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) and\nRetron-Eco2 (Ec67) both replace an identical∼180 bp be-\ntween a phage cohesive end site and the terminator of\na DNA packaging gene (59)( F i g u r e3A). Retron-Sen1\n(Se72)evenexistsonabacterialplasmid( 44).Retron-Nex1\n(Ne160) contains several apparently duplicated repeats of\nmsr and msd sequences without an RT within a kilobase,\nsuggesting that this element may have been repeatedly du-\nplicated and inserted by a distant RT or alternative ele-\nment (60). Other retrons, however, are not associated with\nobvious prophage or other mobile elements. Retron-Eco5\n(Ec107), for example, replaces a palindromic 34 bp in an\nintergenic region that lacks any further characteristics of\nmobility or prophage insertion. In addition to horizontal\ntransfer,manymyxococcalretrons,includingRetron-Mxa1\n(Mx162)andRetron-Sau1(Sa163),clusterincloselyrelated\nbacterial species and show a codon bias that is similar to\nthatofthehost.Theseretronslikelyaroseorwereacquired\nin a common ancestor of the myxobacteria and were verti-\ncally inherited (50).\nHypothesized biological functions\nRetrons’ functional role––if any––remains poorly under-\nstood. Some retrons could potentially be purely selfish ge-\nnetic elements that are neutral or weakly deleterious to the\nhost. However, the observation that retrons encode func-\ntional proteins suggests that they may be beneficial to the\nhost, possibly under specialized conditions (61). In the fol-\nlowingparagraphs,wediscusstheretronswithknownfunc-\n11014 NucleicAcidsResearch,2019,Vol.47,No.21\ntions and consider potential roles for those whose function\nremains unknown.\nCircumstantial evidence suggests that some retrons may\nplaykeyrolesinpathogenesis.DisablingRetron-Sen2(St85)\nor Retron-Eco4 (Ec83) by erasing their ability to produce\nmsDNA reduced the ability of their enteropathogenicS.\nentericaTyphimurium andE.coli hosts to persistently col-\nonize mouse intestine (62). Closer studies of the msDNA-\nnullS.enterica Typhimurium cells indicated severe growth\ndefects in anaerobic conditions. Growth was rescued by\nthe addition of nitrate, a terminal electron acceptor typ-\nically present in aerobic environments. Proteome analysis\nindicated differential expression of 238 proteins between\nwild-type and msDNA-lacking S. entericaTyphimurium\nunder anaerobic conditions, most involved in the reduc-\ntion of electron acceptors present in anaerobic environ-\nments. While the patterns of protein regulation did not fol-\nlow those associated with the major known regulatory pro-\nteins in S. entericaTyphimurium, the authors concluded\nthat in some genetic or epigenetic way Retron-Sen2 (St85)\ncontrols protein abundance that in turn enables the use of\nthe electron acceptors present in anaerobic environments.\nConversely, other studies found that deletion of RT-Sen2\n(Se85) from other, multidrug-resistant strains ofS.enterica\nTyphimurium increased virulence, suggesting an opposing\nrole in the regulation of virulence for this retron (63).\nThe apparent phylogenetic subgroup obtained from\naligning RTs that includes Retron-Sen2 (St85) and Retron-\nEco4 (Ec83) also contains retrons from other pathogenic\nbacterial serovars, including Retron-Eco7 (Ec78), Retron-\nVch1 (Vc95), and Retron-Vpa3 (Vp96). The RTs associ-\nated with these retrons have relatively similar sequences,\nwith aa identity of∼40–58% (Supplementary Table S1).\nSeveral also contain accessory ORFs between the msd\nand RT or downstream of the RT ( 62,64–66)( F i g u r e\n3A). Interestingly, the msrs of two retron pairs in this\ngroup, msr-Vch1 (Vc95)/msr-Vpa1 (Vp96) and msr-Eco4\n(Ec83)/msr-Eco7 (Ec78), share∼75% and∼60% sequence\nidentity (63). Correspondingly, RT-Vch1 (Vc95) and RT-\nEco4 (Ec83) recognize and reverse transcribe msr-msd-\nVpa3 (Vp96) and msr-msd-Eco7 (Ec78), respectively (35).\nThese are the only two examples where an RT can func-\ntion on a non-cognate msr-msd. Moreover, Retron-Vch1\n(Vc95) is almost exclusively found in the epidemic cholera-\ncausing serotypes (O1 and its derivative O139); this retron\nis very rare in non-pathogenic serotypes (66). In contrast,\ntwo non-pathogenic serotypes contain alternate retrons in\nthesamegenomiclocus––Retron-Vch2(Vc81)andRetron-\nVch3 (Vc137). Retron-Vch2 (Vc81) is also oriented in the\noppositedirectionfromRetron-VchI(Vc95)( 64).Thepres-\nence of certain retron variants only in pathogenic species,\nand the similarities between such retrons, has led to spec-\nulation that retrons may play a mechanistic role in patho-\ngenesis (35). Alternatively, the ORFs of unknown function\ncould themselves be pathogenicity determinants that asso-\nciate with retrons to hitchhike between genomes (Figure\n3C).\nBeyond potential roles in pathogenesis, retrons may play\nadaptive roles in the utilization of non-traditional energy\nsources. For example, expression of Retron-Eco5 (Ec107)\nis strongly enhanced in cells that are starved for phos-\nphate or entering stationary phase in rich media (67). Sim-\nilarly, Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) expression resulted in signifi-\ncant downregulation of eight genes and upregulation of\none gene. The eight downregulated genes were important\nin carbon utilization; the remaining gene upregulated the\nproduction of the ribosomal protein S2 (65). Beyond non-\npathogenic E. coli, retrons are especially common in myx-\nococcal bacteria that undergo significant morphological\nchanges, forming multicellular-like, ‘fruiting’ bodies in re-\nsponse to nutrient insufficiency, and show complex inter-\ncommunitybehaviorandpredation( 68);perhapsretronsin\nthese species help enable these phenotypic changes. Addi-\ntionalstudiesarerequiredtolinkretronexpressionandcell\nspecialization.\nWhilethereareseveralhypothesesaboutretrons’biolog-\nicalroles,thereislittleknownabouttheirmechanismofac-\ntion. One possibility is that retrons modulate host DNA-\nbinding proteins via binding to the msDNA. Overexpres-\nsion of someE. coliretrons producing DNA with stems\ncontaining mismatched base pairs increases genomic mu-\ntation rates by∼40-fold (69) and recombination rates in\nhigh-frequency recombination (Hfr) crosses with a compe-\ntentS.enterica Typhimuriumdonorstrain ∼5–10-fold(70).\nThis increase in genomic mutation rate likely occurs be-\ncausethemismatchrepairproteinMutSissequesteredonto\nthe mismatch-containing msDNA stem, reducing protein\navailabilityforgenomicreplication-associatedmismatchre-\npair. Notably, overexpression of retrons that produce ms-\nDNA with fully complementary stems does not increase\nmutation or Hfr rates (70,71). While these increased muta-\ntion frequencies only occurred after∼100-fold overexpres-\nsion of the msDNA relative to standard lab growth condi-\ntions, this study may mimic intracellular or environmental\nconditions that increase retron expression to transiently in-\ncreasegenomicmutationrates( 69).msDNAmaysequester\nother DNA-binding proteins to regulate their activity and,\nin turn, gene expression patterns (72,73). Additionally, ms-\nDNA may directly act as a post-transcriptional gene reg-\nulator, similarly to microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins\n(74).\nFinally, retrons might play a role in targeted genome di-\nversificationoradaptiveimmunity.DGRsarefoundinbac-\nteria, viruses, and archaea and selectivelydiversifytargeted\nloci known as ‘variable’ regions (75) .T h e s ev a r i a b l er e -\ngions typically encode surface-displayed peptides that bind\na changing set of ligands in their environments (76,77). To\ntarget and diversify these regions, DGRs employ special-\nized RTs to reverse transcribe homologous regions known\nas‘template’regions,incorporatingrandomnucleotidesop-\nposite from adenine residues on the RNA transcript inter-\nmediate. The mutated reverse transcript then specifically\nretrotransposes to the variable region. While the details\nof reverse transcription and transposition have yet to be\ndetermined, recent studies have found that, like retron-\nproduced msDNA, the prototypical Bordetella bacterio-\nphage brt RT produces a branched RNA-DNA structure\nmost likely joined by 2\n′-5′ phosphodiester bonds (78,79).\nThesesimilaritiesbetweenretronmsDNAandDGRcDNA\nsuggest that perhaps retron msDNA may home to genetic\nsequencesviaamechanismthatisanalogoustoDGRretro-\nhoming. Alternatively, a recent study suggests that certain\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2019,Vol.47,No.21 11015\nCRISPR-relatedRTsmayhavearisenfromretron-likeRTs,\nsuggesting that retrons could potentially play a similar role\nin adaptive immunity or integration of specific RNA or\nDNA sequences into defined genomic positions (80).\nRETRONS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY\nRetrons are potentially powerful tools for genome edit-\ning because they can produce high copy number intracel-\nlular DNAs in orthogonal hosts. Early experiments indi-\ncated that a Retron-Eco2 (Ec67) msr and RT could suc-\ncessfully reverse transcribe a Retron-Eco3 (Ec73) msd, and\nvice-versa(33).Thiscriticalexperimentdefinedthatwhilea\nretron’s msr and RT are paired, the msd is variable and can\nencode an intracellular DNA with an arbitrary sequence.\nThis critical insight enabled the repurposing of retrons for\nbiotechnological applications. To date, four studies have\nemployed retrons forgene silencing or genome editing (13–\n15,81). Below, we discuss the context, central findings, and\npotential further development of these studies.\nGene targeting in bacteria\nAnearlystudydemonstratedthatretronscanbeengineered\nto produce antisense cDNAs that hybridized to and ulti-\nmately silenced, mRNAs of the targeted genes. Shimada\nand colleagues replaced a portion of the msd of Retron-\nEco5 (Ec107) with a sequence targeting the translation ini-\ntiation sites of an mRNA encoding theE.coli outer mem-\nbranelipoprotein( 81).Theauthorstestedtwodifferenttar-\ngetingsequences,aswellasatargetingsequencecontaining\nanEcoRIdigestionsite,potentiallyenablingcleavageofthe\nsequencetargetinglipoprotein.Eachtargetingsequencein-\nhibited lipoprotein production∼75%.\nMore recently, a landmark study used retrons as bacte-\nrialgenome-editingtools( 13).Inthiswork,smallmolecule-\ninducible retrons acted as a population-level genomic ana-\nlog ‘tape-recorder’ of the small molecules’ presence inE.\ncoli (Figure 4A, B). Termed Synthetic Cellular Recorders\nIntegrating Biological Events (‘SCRIBE’), this approach\nused engineered variants of Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) with msds\nprogrammed to correct two premature stop codons in re-\nporter genes, ultimately editing a total of 5–6 contiguous\nbases. Co-expressing the retron msr-msd with the bacterio-\nphage lambda red protein Beta (a single-stranded DNA-\nbinding protein commonly employed in recombineering\n(5)) increased editing frequency of the retron transcript\na thousand-fold (from ∼10\n−7/cell to ∼10−4/cell) after\novernight expression. This improved genome editing effi-\nciencywasappropriatefordetectionofmodifiedcellswithin\na heterogeneous population. SCRIBE could (i) quantita-\ntively record inducers’ concentration and duration by mea-\nsuring the proportion of cells containing retron-introduced\nedits; (ii) record exposure to complex combinations of in-\nducer molecules and (iii) record cellular exposure to light\nvia the use of a light-responsive promoter.\nRetron-based editing in bacteria has been further\nadapted to support the possibility of continuous evolution\nof target loci (15)( F i g u r e4C). Knocking out MutS, pre-\nviously shown to bind retron msDNA, further increased\nediting efficiency 21-fold compared to wild-type cells (70).\nRemoving exonuclease ExoX, which degrades double and\nsingle-stranded DNAs from the 3\n′ to 5′ end, increased edit-\ning efficiency 5-fold (82). An E. coli that harbored the\ndoubleΔmutSΔexoXdeletion increased retron-based edit-\ning efficiency 78-fold to∼0.05/cell after overnight expres-\nsion. Measurements with a similar kanamycin resistance-\ncorrecting model system to that employed in the bacterial\ntape recorder indicated that retrons could simultaneously\nedit up to 13 bases spanning a 31-base region, and insert\nand delete three-base regions. Expressing the retron in this\noptimized system under an error-prone RNA polymerase\nled to the introduction of unprogrammed, random muta-\ntions in the targeted gene, setting the stage for continuous\nevolution schemes. Overall, these modifications increased\nthe mutation rate of the targeted region to∼10\n−6 base−1\ngeneration−1, ∼200-fold above background.\nHeterologous expression of retrons\nBiotechnological retron applications were bolstered by\nearlystudiesthatretronscanproducesatelliteDNAsineu-\nkaryotichosts.Forexample,Retron-Eco2(Ec67)expressed\nunder the control of a Gal10 promoter produced msDNA\nin S. cerevisiae(83). Robust msDNA production required\nthe concurrent expression of the RT and the msr-msd. The\nresulting msDNA was the same length as seen in the na-\ntive E. colihost. In yeast, moving the RT to the 5\n′ side of\nthe msr-msd region increased msDNA production seven-\nfold over that produced in the native orientation where the\nRT is to the 3\n′ sideofthemsr-msdregion( 83).Retron-Eco2\n(Ec67) could also produce msDNA in mouse embryonic fi-\nbroblasts by expressing this 5\n′ RT-containing variant with\nT7 RNA polymerase (84). However, msDNA copy number\nwas ∼25 copies per cell,∼25-fold lower than seen in the\nnativebacterialhost.Nonetheless,theseearlystudiesestab-\nlishedthatretronscanbeexpressedinorthogonalhostsand\nthat the host’s RNAse H activity was sufficient to process\nthe reverse-transcribed msd to generate msDNA.\nMore recently, retrons have been used for aiding\nhomology-directed repair of Cas9-targeted breaks in yeast\nin a platform termed Cas9 Retron precISe Parallel Edit-\ningviahomologY(‘CRISPEY’)( 14)(Figure 4D).Themsr-\nmsd of Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) was appended to a Cas9 single\nguide RNA (sgRNA) that targeted a genomic region of in-\nterest.Co-expressionofthischimericsgRNA-retronRNA,\nRT-Eco1 (Ec86) and Cas9 led to the co-localization of two\nfunctionalunits:(i)aCas9nucleasethatgeneratedadefined\nDNA break in the vicinity of the edit site; (ii) a DNA tem-\nplate derived from the msd segment of the sgRNA-retron\nRNA fusion. After Cas9 and RT induction, the reverse-\ntranscribed msd could carry out homology-directed DNA\nbreak repair at high efficiency. Single nucleotide polymor-\nphisms were incorporated in>96% of all clones and a 765\nbase pair insertion was observed in 87% of edited yeast\ncells. Ultimately, this technique was employed for the high-\nefficiencyprofilingoftheeffectof ∼16,000single-nucleotide\npolymorphismsinyeast,enablingidentificationof572vari-\nants that impacted fitness during growth on glucose.

One critical gap is the lack of a retron RT structure,\neither alone or as part of a priming complex. Thus, we can\nonly conjecture about the unique priming mechanism and\nthefunctionsofaccessorydomainsinretronRTs.Thefunc-\ntionsofotherretron-associatedORFs arealso unexplored.\nAs with many natural biomolecules that have proven in-\ndispensable to modern biotechnologies, an improved un-\nderstanding of natural retron function and biology should\ngreatly accelerate biotechnology applications.\nRetrons are unique in their ability to produce satellite\nDNAs with arbitrary sequencesin vivo. This is a feature\nthat suddenly thrusts retrons to the fore of genome editing\ntechniques,astheycanbeharnessedtoenablegenomeedit-\ningwithouttheneedtointroduceexternaloligonucleotides\nvia electroporation or transfection. On the horizon are op-\nportunities to harness retrons as dynamic, self-diversifying\ntemplates for editing targeted genes, thereby enabling tar-\ngeted continuous evolution. Further optimizing retron ex-\npression and function in eukaryotic cells and organisms\nwill likely enable diverse applications, such as the ability to\nmarkcellsduringembryogenesisandcarryoutlineageanal-\nyses via continuous evolution of barcodes. In another vein,\nretron-producedDNAmayalsoproveusefulforgenerating\nhighly programmable DNA nanostructures inside cells. Fi-\nnally, retron-derived RTs may have unique applications on\ntheir own, just as Group II intron RTs have found applica-\ntions for NGS library preparation.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSupplementary Dataare available at NAR Online.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank Y.G.

One third of annotated retrons carry additional\nopen reading frames (ORFs), the contribution and\nsigniﬁcance of which in retron biology remains to\nbe determined. In this study we developed a com-\nputational pipeline for the systematic prediction of\ngenes speciﬁcally associated with retron RTs based\non a previously reported large dataset representa-\ntive of the diversity of prokaryotic RTs. We found\nthat retrons generally comprise a tripartite system\ncomposed of the ncRNA, the RT and an additional\nprotein or RT -fused domain with diverse enzymatic\nfunctions. These retron systems are highly modular,\nand their components have coevolved to different ex-\ntents. Based on the additional module, we classiﬁed\nretrons into 13 types, some of which include addi-\ntional variants. Our ﬁndings provide a basis for fu-\nture studies on the biological function of retrons and\nfor expanding their biotechnological applications.\nINTRODUCTION\nReverse transcriptases (RTs, also known as ‘RNA-\ndependent DNA polymerases’) were discovered in 1970,\nby Temin and Baltimore, in tumor viruses (1,2). These\nenzymes are present in the three domains of life capable\nof polymerizing cDNA from an RNA template. They\nare known principally as a key component of eukaryotic\nmobile retrotransposons (3) and retroviruses (4), but they\nare also widely distributed among bacterial and archaeal\nspecies.\nProkaryotic RTs were not discovered until 1989, when\nthey were identified as components of retrons, respon-\nsible for the production of short single-stranded linear\nDNA fragments (5,6). RTs were subsequently shown to be\npresentindiversity-generatingretroelements(DGRs)( 7,8),\nabortive phage infection (Abi) systems (9–11), CRISPR-\nCassystems( 12–19)andgroupIIintrons,thislastcategory\nbeingtheonlyoneforwhichautonomousmobilityhasbeen\ndemonstrated(20–23).Themostrecentexhaustivephyloge-\nneticanalysisofprokaryoticRTs( 17)revealedahugediver-\nsity, in the form of group II introns (47%), retron/retron-\nlikesequences(25%),andDGRs(12%),withtheremaining\n16%clusteringintodistinctgroups,includingCRISPR-Cas\nassociatedRTs,Abi-likeandotheryetuncharacterizedRTs,\nsuch as the G2L (group II-like) or UG (unknown) groups.\nRetrons are defined by their unique ability to produce\nan unusual satellite DNA known as msDNA (multicopy\nsingle-stranded DNA) (24), the function of which remains\nunknown. They consist of∼2000 bp of DNA including\nanRT-codinggene( ret)andcontiguousinvertedsequences\n(msr and msd). The msr/msd regions and theretgene are\ntranscribed as a single RNA, which is folded into a spe-\ncificsecondarystructure.Oncetranslated,theRTbindsthe\nRNA template downstream from the msd region, initiat-\ningreversetranscription oftheRNAtowardsits5\n′ end,as-\nsisted by the 2′OH group present in a conserved branching\nG residue that acts as a primer.

The conserved NAXXH motif\nand VTG triplet in retron RTs are indicated.

The significance of these proteins, and their role\nin retron biology, remain to be determined.\nDespite numerous characterizationsin vitroand in vivo,\nvery little is known about the biology of retrons, and their\nputative function has remained a mystery for almost 30\nyears (31). Here, we develop a computational pipeline for\nthe systematic prediction of genes specifically associated\nwith retron RTs, and report that most bacterial retrons are\ntripartite systems including, in addition to the (msr-msd)\nncRNA gene and the RT, a primary protein-coding gene\nor RT-fused domain. The predicted functions of this third\ncomponentarehighlydiverse.Thethreecomponentsofthe\nretron systems display an extraordinary modularity, prob-\nably expanding their functional and mechanistic diversity,\nbut comparisons between the phylogenies obtained for the\nncRNA, the RT and the associated proteins suggest that\ntheyhavecoevolved,providingadditionalevidenceinfavor\nof a functional association. Clustering on the basis of the\ngenes encoding these associated proteins or RT-fused do-\nmains groups retron systems into 13 types, some of which\ninclude additional subtypes or variants.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProkaryotic reverse transcriptase datasets\nThedatasetofprokaryoticRTsusedforthesystematicpre-\ndiction of genes specifically associated with retron RTs re-\nported here consisted of a previously published dataset of\n9141uniquerepresentativeentriesderivedfromthecluster-\ning, at 85% sequence identity, of 198 760 annotated reverse\ntranscriptases obtained from different databases (17). This\ndataset contains group-II introns (47%), retron/retron-like\n(25%) and DGRs RT sequences (12%), the remaining 16%\nclustering into distinct groups including RTs linked to\nCRISPR-Cas systems, Abi-like RTs and uncharacterized\nRTs grouped into the G2L (group II-like) and UG groups\n(17). The specific retron dataset further analyzed in this\nstudycomprises1912retron /retron-likeRTsequencesfrom\nthedatasetdescribedaboveand16RTsfromexperimentally\nvalidated retrons (28) (Supplementary Table S1).\nClustering of neighboring proteins\nTheORFslocatedwithin ± 30kbofeachRTwereretrieved\nand clustered with the MMseqs2 suite (32). Sequences of\n<30 amino acids (aa) or>3000 aa were discarded from\ntheanalysisduetopoordownstreamclustering.Connected\ncomponent clustering was first performed, to cover re-\nmote homologs. We then performed deeper iterative cas-\ncaded searches until convergence, to merge close clusters\nand to cover more remote homologs with the mmseqs\nsearch and mmseqs result2profile utilities (https://github.\ncom/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki).Thisprocedureyielded62\n277 clusters, 5413 of which had more than five members.\nPrediction of functional association\nWe encoded the neighborhood of the 9141 RTs, by con-\nstructingapresence /absencematrix,inwhichtherowscor-\nresponded to the RTs ordered by the position on the tree,\nand the columns corresponded to the various neighboring\nproteinclusters,orderedbysize.Thismatrixwasfurtheran-\nalyzedbycomputingtwoparametersprovidinganestimate\nof the non-random distribution of every cluster across the\ntree.\nWefirstcalculatedthedensityofproteinoccurrencefora\ngivencluster,bycalculatingthemovingaverageofeachcol-\numn (bandwidth= 50, steps= 1) and normalizing the val-\nuesobtainedwiththemovingaverageandmovingstandard\ndeviation of 10 000 random permutations for each cluster\nsize. We set a cutoff value for statistical significance of the\nmean value plus four times the standard deviation for the\nrandompermutations.Inordertonormalizedifferentclus-\nters by their size, we calculated a parameter (hereafter re-\nferred as phyvalue) consisting of the ratio of the sliding av-\nerage to the selected cutoff.

We then built co-\nvariate models with cmbuild from the Infernal suite (52),\nand used these models to search for similar structures up-\nstream and downstream from the start of the RT gene.\nIn groups in which no validated msr-msd transcripts were\npreviously described, we manually searched for structured\nregions with features similar to those described for other\nmsr-msd transcripts in the vicinity of RT-coding genes us-\ning RNAfold (53), and we built multiple alignments with\nMAFFT-Q-INS-i (33), with the aim of locating conserved\nsequences in closely related genomes.

As a way to measure the co-\nevolution between the different components of the retrons,\nwe compared the trees distances between the components\nof the retron tripartite system and that for the correspond-\ning 16S RNAs retrieved from the SILVA database (54).

The phylogenetic trees inferred from the alignment\n(domains RT0–7) of 1912 retron/retron-like RT sequences\nfrom the above dataset and 16 additional RTs from experi-\nmentally validated retrons (28) revealed that they could be\ngroupedinto11well-supportedclades(Figure 2AandSup-\n12636 NucleicAcidsResearch,2020,Vol.48,No.22\nplementary Table S1). Interestingly, unlike other RTs, such\nasthoseencodedbygroupIIintronsandDGRs,theclades\ninferred from the phylogeny of retron RTs displayed strong\nsupport even for the inner nodes (Supplementary File S1)\nprobablycorrespondingtomorerecentevolution.Allthese\nRTsdisplayedfeaturescharacteristicofretron-typeRTs,in-\ncluding region Y and region X (28). Region Y, which is lo-\ncated at the C-terminus, contains a highly conserved VTG\ntriplet within the RT7 domain (with G the most conserved\nresidue), and directs the RT to its cognate msr. By con-\ntrast,regionX,locatedbetweentheRT2andRT3domains,\npresents a characteristic NAXXH motif (with H the most\nconserved residue) and may be essential for reverse tran-\nscriptioninitiationorcatalysis(Figure 1).Moreover,16ex-\nperimentally validated retrons (28) were found to cluster in\nsix of the 11 clades identified (Figure2A, Table1 and Sup-\nplementary Table S1). These data further support the iden-\ntificationoftheclusteredRTsasretron /retron-likeRTsand\nhighlightthewide-ranginggeneticdiversityofthebacterial\nretron dataset used in this work.\nThe retron ncRNA gene associated with retron/retron-like\nRT sequences\nRetrons are usually defined as contiguous transcriptional\ncassettes encompassing an ncRNA gene containing the\nmsr and msd regions and a specialized reverse transcrip-\ntase (RT) gene (Figure1). Retron msr-msd transcriptional\ncassettes have divergent sequences but display substan-\ntial structural similarities (28). We, therefore, analyzed the\ngenomic neighborhood of the retron/retron-like RT se-\nquences, searching for conserved RNA secondary struc-\nturesresemblingthoseofpreviouslycharacterizedmsr-msd\ntranscripts. Typically, msr-msd transcripts fold into a char-\nacteristicstructureinwhichtheinvertedrepeatsattheends\nhybridize,leavingthestructureslocatedinthemsrandmsd\nregions in internal positions. The msr region contains one\nto three hairpins, whereas the msd region contains a long\nstable stem-loop (Figure1). Using covariance models and\nconsensusstructuredetection,wewereabletoidentifythese\ncharacteristicstructureswithahighdegreeofconfidencein\neightofthe11RTcladesdescribedhere,someofwhichhad\nno previous experimentally validated representatives (Fig-\nure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1). Some of the RT\nclades had a single consensus structure for the msr-msd\ntranscript (clades 7 and 8), whereas others (clades 1, 2, 3,\n9, 10 and 11) displayed greater structural diversity, with\ntwo or three different consensus structures, highlighting a\nmodularity of the (msr-msd)-RT cassette. All the proposed\nstructures display the common features described in previ-\nousstudies,withshorthairpinsinthemsrregionandalong\nstem-loop in the msd region. However, some of the above\nclades(clades3,7,8and9)havelargesubbranchesinwhich\nthis structure was not found and we were unable to detect\nsignificantconsensusstructuresinclades4,5and6(Supple-\nmentaryTableS1).Nevertheless,wenotedsequenceconser-\nvationinthevicinityoftheseRTsandcloserelatives(foran\nexample see Supplementary Figure S2). It is not, therefore,\npossible to rule out the possibility of associated ncRNA\ntranscripts with unusual structures not resembling that of\ncanonical msr-msd transcripts. These results reveal an ex-\ntraordinarydiversityofretronunitsthatcouldnoteasilybe\nclassified on the basis of the structure of the msr-msd tran-\nscript or the phylogenetic origin of the RT. The consensus\nstructuresprovidedinFigure 2BandSupplementaryFigure\nS1 represent a compendium of all the secondary structures\nfrom a given group of msd/msr transcripts, and do not,\ntherefore, account for individual variations that could con-\ntributetothebiologicalfunctionsoftheretronsconcerned.\nTakentogether,theseresultsprovidefurthersupportforthe\nidentification of the retron/retron-like RTs included in this\ndataset as a component ofbonafide retrons.\nPrediction of genes functionally associated with retron RTs\nand classification of retron systems\nThe increase in the amount of genomic data available from\npublic databases has made it possible to develop and use\nnovel methodologies and analyses, with the aim of predict-\ning functional associations between proteins (57). It is cur-\nrently thought that only a third of annotated retrons have\naccessory open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown func-\ntion (28\n). We investigated the range of this association and\nthe feasibility of predicting genes functionally associated\nwith retron RTs and separating them from spurious asso-\nciations without bias related to their hypothetical function,\nby developing a computational procedure integrating the\npreviously constructed phylogenetic information based on\nthe large prokaryotic RT dataset comprising 9141 RT se-\nquences (17).\nThis pipeline consisted of several sequential steps sum-\nmarized in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3. We\nfirst retrieved all the aa sequences corresponding to an-\nnotated coding sequences in the vicinity (±30 kb) of the\n9141 RTs. We clustered these sequences by deep iterative\ncomparison,toensurethatremotehomologswerecovered.\nThis resulted in in 5413 clusters with more than five rep-\nresentatives. We assessed the likelihood of these clusters\nbeing associated with RTs, by calculating two parameters:\n(i) the non-random distribution of clusters across the tree\n(phyvalue) and (ii) the percentage sequence identity of the\nRTs involved. Using these two parameters, we were able\nto show that the clusters were associated with RTs, includ-\ning those previously reported to be associated with RT-\nCRISPR, such as Cas2 (cluster 30) (14,15)( F i g u r e4), and\nDGRs such as Avd (cluster 4) (58) (not shown) proteins.\nSimilarly,theclusterspredictedtobepotentiallyassociated\nwith group II introns (94.56%) on the basis of phylogenetic\naccumulationdidnotpassthesequenceidentitycutofftest,\nconsistent with group II introns being autonomous mobile\nretroelements(Figure 4).Wethenanalyzedatotalof71sub-\nclusters(Figure 4andSupplementaryTableS2)predictedto\nbeassociatedwithretronRTsfurthermanuallyandcase-by-\ncase,andthoseconsideredtobespuriousbasedoninconsis-\ntenciesingenomicarrangement,irregularpresence /absence\npatterns or poor alignments were removed.

Finally,\nRaptorX identified the OLD nuclease fromThermusscoto-\nductus(PDB 6p74A) as the best template-protein structure\n(100% of the residues modeled and aP-value of 2.96e–09)\nfortheseproteins.Takentogether,theseresultssuggestthat\nthe proteins in clusters 22\n2 and 1591 are probably new\nmembers of the OLD-protein nuclease family.\nThe Toprim domain of the protein sequences in clus-\nters 222 and 1591 contained the characteristic aspartate\ndyad (DxD) of motif V required for activity in all Toprim-\ncontaining enzymes, and the N-terminal invariant gluta-\nmate of motif IV, all preceded by conserved hydrophobic\nresidues, suggesting that these are catalytically active en-\nzymes(SupplementaryFigureS6).TheToprimdomainalso\nappearsinthethreevariantsofsubtypeI-C,butfusedatthe\nC-terminus of the corresponding RT. The replacement of\nthesecondaspartateresidueintheDxDmotifwithagluta-\nmate residue (DxE) is a signature specific to the I-C2 vari-\nant. Phylogenetic analyses (Figure6B and Supplementary\nFileS3)suggestedthattheToprimdomainsofclusters22\n2\n(I-B1) and 1591 (I-B2) were more closely related to that of\nOLD nucleases, whereas that of subtype I-C arose from a\ncommon ancestor and formed a different, presumably new\nlineage within the Toprim superfamily.\nRetron system type VII includes an additional domain\n(DUF3800) fused at the C-terminus of the RT in the VII-\nA1 variant, and an associated protein (cluster 2165) in\nthe VII-A2 variant, both containing the DUF3800 domain\n(Pfam12686).Thisassociatedproteinofunknownfunction\nis characterized by a DE motif at the N-terminus, but lack\nthe conserved Q of the characteristic QxxD motif at the C-\nterminus (Supplementary Figure S7). Moreover, these pro-\ntein sequences form two well-differentiated clades (Supple-\nmentary Figure S8 and Supplementary File S4), suggest-\ning that they may not result from fission/fusion events. In-\nterestingly, the modeling of cluster 2165 protein sequences\nwith RaptorX delivered,as the best template-protein struc-\nture(100%oftheresiduesmodeledanda P-valueof1.39e–\n11), pdb: 3pufA and pdb: 1EKE, corresponding to the hu-\nmanand Methanocaldococcusjannaschii RNaseH2,respec-\ntively. However, it should be noted that, in the DUF3800\nprotein/domain associated with the retron type VII sys-\ntem, the second conserved aspartate residue of the four\nhighly conserved carboxylates (DEDD) forming the ac-\ntive site of RNases H is replaced by a glutamate residue\n(DEED). The putative functional assignment of these en-\nzymes as a type of RNaseH2 therefore requires further\nverification.\nRetronsystemIXcarriestwolinkedgenesupstreamfrom\nthe retron module encoding a first protein from cluster\n1740\n1, predicted by HHpred and HMM searches to be a\nHEPN domain-containing protein, and a second overlap-\nping (∼8 bp) gene encoding a protein from cluster 10931\npredicted by HHpred and InterPro to carry a putative\nHTH12 C-terminal ‘Winged helix’ DNA-binding domain,\nasfoundattheN-terminusofribonucleaseRandanumber\nof presumed transcriptional regulatory proteins from ar-\nchaea.Theidentificationofcluster1070\n1ascorresponding\nto HEPN domain-containing proteins was also supported\nby protein structure modeling with RaptorX and Phyre2,\nwhich provided, as the best template, pdb:2hsbA (HEPN-\ndomain containing protein fromArchaeoglobus fulgidus),\nwith aP-value of 5.09e–05. The proteins of cluster 1740\n1\nlack the conserved H residue of the characteristic HEPN\nmotif (Rx4–6H), which has repeatedly been shown to be di-\nrectlyinvolvedinRNAcleavage( 67–69).Instead,thesepro-\nteinshaveaconservedhistidineresiduelocateddownstream\nfrom the arginine residue modeled as close to the R of the\nHEPN motif, as shown in the predicted structure (Figure\n7A and B). It is therefore plausible that this residue is an\nalternative active-site residue, similar to that present in the\nHEPN-T family (62). The presence of a putative HEPN-\ndomain active site in the proteins of cluster 1740\n1 there-\nfore suggests that they may provide this retron system with\nRNase activity.\nRetron system type XIII has a linked gene upstream\nor downstream from the RT gene that encodes a cluster\n114 1 protein with a C-terminal SWIM Zn-finger domain\n(CxCx12CxH) (P-value 3e–06) predicted to have DNA-\nbindingandprotein-proteininteractionfunctions.Searches\nforhomologoussequences(HMMER)andstructuralanal-\nyses(Phyre2)alsopredictedthepresenceofaDprA(DNA-\nprocessing protein A) winged helix (Pfam17782) domain\nupstream from this motif. Moreover, the proteins of cluster\n114\n1 have a central Dx7[D]x4Ex30–32Dx37E motif, with the\nsecond aspartate residue absent or replaced by glutamate\ninclosehomologs(SupplementaryFigureS9).ThisDEDE\nmotif has been described in some prokaryotic (IS256fam-\nily) mobile elements and in some Mutator transposases\nfrom eukaryotes (70), which suggest that the proteins of\ncluster 1141 may be derived from unknown transposases.\nMany, but not all, of the associated 1141 proteins in type\nXIII systems are preceded by a gene encoding a predicted\nHEAT/ARM-like repeat-containing protein a member of\ncluster 2161 (the majority), 2162 or 32621 and, in some\ncases, by two genes, one encoding a cluster 2591p r o t e i n\nand the other encoding a cluster 16881 protein.

Strikingly, these proteins\nhad a predicted three-dimensional structure similar to that\nof epsilon antitoxin proteins from postsegregational killing\n(PSK) systems (71), as shown by a DALI search against\nPDB, suggesting a plausible common role for the clusters\nin a retron-associated toxin-antitoxin system.\nThe type X system (Figure5 and Table1) was found\nto be associated with a gene encoding a cluster 2273 pro-\ntein upstream from the RT, predicted to contain a central\nintegration host factor (IHF)-like DNA-binding domain\n(Pfam00216) and a C-terminal von Hippel-Landau (VHL)\nbeta domain (Pfam01847) separated by a single TM helix,\nwith the VHL beta domain on the cytoplasmic side.

We hypothesize that\nthese two systems may be involved in cleavage of targeting\npeptides.\nDISCUSSION\nThe biological role of retrons has remained a mystery for\nalmost three decades, despite the identification of these el-\nements as the first type of RT to be discovered in prokary-\notes. Some observations, such as the presence of additional\nopenreadingframes(ORFs)downstreamfromtheRTgene\nor between the msr and msd regions in one third of an-\nnotated retrons, have raised questions about their impli-\ncations for retron biology prompting further speculation\nabout their possible involvement in the production of un-\nusual msDNAs (28). Here, we describe a computational\npipeline for the systematic prediction of genes specifically\nassociatedwithretronRTsbasedonapreviouslypublished\nlarge dataset of annotated RTs representativeof current di-\nversity in prokaryotes. We therefore avoid any bias relating\ntotheparticularphylogeneticgroupoftheRT,thegenomic\ncontext of the RT gene, the distance to the RT gene or hy-\npothetical possible functions, making it possible to predict\nthe functional association of genes with retrons with con-\nfidence. Using this computational strategy, we found that\nthe (msr-msd)-RT cassette of retrons could be predicted to\nbe functionally linked to a single locus encoding putative\nnucleases, genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, genes\nencodingproteinsbindingDNAorRNA,orproteinsasso-\nciatedwiththecellmembrane .Insomecases,theretronunit\nislinkedtoadditionalaccessoryprotein-encodinggenes,or\nthe RT has additional fused domains. Based on the associ-\natedproteinorRT-fuseddomain,wehaveclassifiedretrons\ninto13distinctsystems,somewithsubtypesorvariants.We\nwouldexpectthevastmajorityofretronsystemstobeofthe\ntypesidentifiedhere,butitremainsplausiblethatotherrare\ntypesandvariantsmaybediscoveredinthefuture,particu-\nlarlyinmetagenomicanalyses.Ourresultsdemonstratethat\nretrons can be broadly considered to be tripartite systems\nconsistingofthencRNA(msr-msd),theRTandadditional\nproteins with diverse enzymatic functions.\nWe also found a fewretron RT clades/subclades that did\nnotappeartobeassociatedwithanyspecificproteincluster,\nsuch as the branches found in clades 2 and 11. Clade 2 in-\ncludes the RT of the Retron-Eco5 (Ec107) intron, which is\nlocated adjacent to an annotated orotate phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase. However, only two of the 59 RTs belonging to\nthis branch are associated with such an additional protein.\nThis branch has a node in common with a cluster of RTs\nlinked to PRTase-like proteins. It is therefore plausible that\nmost of the members of the Retron-Eco5 (Ec107) branch\nhave lost the associated protein. Interestingly, Retron-Eco5\nis the only experimentally studiedE.coli retron not related\nto prophages (72). It is, therefore, also conceivable that, in\nthisparticularcase,theadjacentphosphoribosyltransferase\nisnotfunctionallylinkedtotheretronunit.Moreover,most\nof the host genomes harboring the orphan retrons lack ho-\nmologsoftheidentifiedretronassociatedproteins.Itthere-\nfore remains to be determined whether such retron systems\nhave evolved to function with currently unknown protein\neffectorsintrans, or whether they have acquired a different\nmechanistic function.\nInterestingly, these tripartite units display extraordinary\nmodularity, and distantly related RTs and different ncR-\nNAs appear to be associated with genes encoding proteins\nof similar function. Conversely, particular RTs and ncR-\nNAs appear to be linked to functionally different proteins.\nAssociatedprotein-codinggenesofsimilartypesarepresent\nin different clades of the RT phylogeny, indicating a prob-\nable exchange of modules between systems. These phylo-\ngenetic studies reveal a complex evolutionary scenario for\nretrons, in which the different modules of the systems have\nbeen exchanged on multiple occasions. For example, types\nI-AandII-A1haveanncRNA-RTmoduleincommon,but\nhave different putative ‘effector’ modules. It seems that, at\na certain point in evolution, type II-A1 retrons acquired\na different effector module from the ‘Septu’ defense sys-\ntem (66). The presence of an ncRNA-RT module may add\nnew features and complexity to the regulatory mechanism\nof previous existing systems, as for the RTs embedded in\nRT\n/CRISPR-Cas systems, which made it possible to ac-\nquire spacers from RNA molecules (14,16,19). The diver-\nsityofassociatedproteinsandthemodularityofretronsys-\ntems are expanding the known functional diversity of the\nretron unit and the range of cellular processes underlying\nretron activity. A similar cassette organization with diverse\naccessory modules has recently been described for DGRs,\nlinkingRTstofunctionsotherthandiversifyingattachment\nproteins (73)\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2020,Vol.48,No.22 12645\nThe dynamic gain-loss is frequent for genes present in\nmobilegeneticelements(MGEs)anddefensesystems,such\nas toxin-antitoxin modules (74). Autonomous mobility has\nnotbeendemonstratedforretrons,butthereisevidencefor\nthe horizontal transfer of these units (75) even with inser-\ntion into the same genomic site in closely related strains\n(76), and retrons seem to be components of rapidly evolv-\ning genomic islands under strong selective pressure, proba-\nbly due to the constant threat posed by new bacteria.\nConsistent with gain-loss and HGT, we found that the\nmost retron RTs, albeit more abundant in the phylum Pro-\nteobacteria, show a patchy distribution into distinct bacte-\nrialphyla.Nevertheless,wealsofoundthatsomeretronsys-\ntems like the type XIII have a relevant correlation with the\n16SrRNAgeneofthehostgenomeconsistentwiththever-\ntical inheritance reported inMyxobacteria(77). Moreover,\ntwo RT clades show a significant restriction in their taxo-\nnomicdistribution.Clade2ismostlyfoundinGammapro-\nteobacteria and clade 11 is essentially restricted to the phy-\nlum Actinobacteria. Thus, some retrons appear to display\na vertical inheritance and may have been domesticated to\nperform useful cellular functions other than defense.\nSequence divergent retrons such as Vc95 (Retron-Vch1),\nVc81(Retron-Vch2)andVc137(Retron-Vch3)areinserted\ninto the same site on chromosome I ofV. cholerae(76).\nThe first retron is almost exclusively found in pathogenic\nserogroups ofV. choleraewhilst the latter two are found\nin non-pathogenic serotypes. These observations have led\nto speculation that either the retron (msr-msd-RT cassette)\nor the additional ORFs of unknown function are determi-\nnants of pathogenicity, and that the latter may associate\nwith retrons to move and exchange between genomes (28).\nAccordingtotheRTphylogenyandspecificassociatedpro-\nteins,Vc95andVc85belongtothetypeI-AandtypeII-A1\nsystems,respectively,andtheirRTsarecloselyrelated(clade\n1) sharing a ncRNA (IA/IIA1) structure. In our retron\ndatasetVc137correspondinSupplementaryTableS1toen-\ntry 1575 (fig|1343738.3.peg.2232) and belongs to the type\nII-A3 with a more divergent RT (clade 9). Vc81 and Vc137\nareassociatedtoNDT-likeproteinswhereasVc95hasasso-\nciated ATPase and HNH domains. It seems plausible that\nthese retrons share similar mechanistic functions and in-\nsertion mechanism that likely explain their presence in the\nsame locus, but the distinctive putative effector proteins of\nVc95maybethedeterminantofitspredictedpathogenicity\nalso depending on the host genome.\nThe idea that retrons (msr-msd-RT cassette) and associ-\nated proteins function as a unit is also supported by tran-\nscriptional analyses showing that the retron and the puta-\ntive associated effector protein function as an operon, ex-\npressedunderthecontrolofasinglepromoter( 78).Theex-\nactmechanismofretronfunctioningandthepossibleinter-\nactionofthe(msr-msd)-RTcassettewiththelinkedprotein\nremaintobeelucidated,butwespeculatethattheconserved\nncRNA and RT components form the sensing/recognition\nmodule, and that the additional associated protein acts as\nthe response module in the retron system, to deal with dif-\nferentcellularstressesandregulatoryprocesses,potentially\nincludinganti-phagedefense.Retronshavebeenreportedto\nbeinvolved inbacterial responsestostressconditions,such\nas starvation and anaerobic conditions (79,80).\nRecently, it was reported that some retrons members\nof the type systems I-A (Retron+ATPase+HNH), II-\nA3 (Nuc\ndeoxy+Retron), I-C1 (Retron-Toprim) and XII\n(Retron-TIR) defined here mediate antiphage defense and\nthat the additional proteins or RT-fused domains are also\nrequired for activity (81). Moreover, a recent report (82)\nand two pre-prints (83,84) have also suggested that retrons\nmaybenovelanti-phagedefensesystemsandthattheymay\nfunctionasatoxin /antitoxinsystem.Thefirstoftheseroles\nis thought to be mediated by the RT and msDNA, with\nthe linked effector protein responsible for toxin/antitoxin\nfunctions. Furthermore, according to these reports (81,82),\na large number of retrons, but not all are associated with\ndefense genes in defense islands. It would be interesting to\nknow whether there are specific retron systems consistently\nunrelated the known and novel candidate defense systems\nrecently described (81).

Phage genetic\nengineering relies mostly on homologous recombination (HR) assisted by the targeted\nelimination of wild-type phages by CRISPR-Cas nucleases. These strategies are often\nless effective in virulent bacteriophages with large genomes. T5 is a virulent phage\nthat infects Escherichia coli. We found that CRISPR-Cas9 system (type II-A) had\nununiform efﬁcacies against T5, which impairs a reliable use of CRISPR-Cas-assisted\ncounterselection in the gene editing of T5. Here, we present alternative strategies for\nthe construction of mutants in T5. Bacterial retroelements (retrons) proved to be efﬁcient\nfor T5 gene editing by introducing point mutations in the essential gene A1. We set up\na protocol based on dilution-ampliﬁcation-screening (DAS) of phage pools for mutant\nenrichment that was used to introduce a conditional mutation in another essential gene\n(A2), insert a new gene ( lacZα), and construct a translational fusion of a late phage\ngene with a ﬂuorescent protein coding gene ( pb10-mCherry). The method should be\napplicable to other virulent phages that are naturally resistant to CRISPR/Cas nucleases.\nKeywords: bacteriophages, genome editing, CRISPR-Cas, retrons, dilution-ampliﬁcation-screening\nINTRODUCTION\nBacteriophage genome engineering opens avenues to investigate the role of viral genes in infection\nand to generate bacteriophages with new properties. Until the late 1970s, genetic modiﬁcations were\nonly possible through random mutagenesis (Drake and Baltz, 1976). Recombinant DNA technology\nlater allowed the ﬁrst phage gene editing to be carried out in T4 (Völker and Showe, 1980). Since\nthen, continuous improvements of targeted mutagenesis methods were developed.\nA ﬁrst strategy, BRED (Bacteriophage Recombineering of Electroporated DNA), aimed to\nincrease the recombination frequency between a template and a bacteriophage (Marinelli et al.,\n2008) but it relies heavily on the compatibility of the recombinases with the phage to be engineered\nand on a high electroporation eﬃciency, which is hard to achieve for phages with large genomes.\nA second line of progress consisted in the improved recovery of phage mutants through\nthe elimination of unmodiﬁed (wild-type) phages. In phage T7, selection of phage mutants was\npossible through the use of marker genes that are essential for phage infection in some host\nbackgrounds (Grigonyte et al., 2020). Although the strategy looks promising, its application\nrequires prior knowledge of host genes essential for infection, and the availability of suitable\nhost mutants. This technique is therefore limited to well-studied phages in model organisms. An\nalternative to marker-based method is the use of CRISPR-Cas nucleases, enzymes that can be\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 667332\nfmicb-12-667332 April 20, 2021 Time: 15:56 # 2\nRamirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\ntargeted to precise sequences thanks to their association with\nso-called guide RNAs. CRISPR-Cas nucleases were successfully\nused to eliminate the wild-type phages that have not undergone\nHR and thereby enrich the phage population in mutant viruses.\nImproved recovery of phage mutants was reported using type\nI-E, type II-A CRISPR or type III-A systems (Kiro et al., 2014;\nMartel and Moineau, 2014; Tao et al., 2017; Hatoum-Aslan, 2018;\nHupfeld et al., 2018). Despite these improvements in the reverse\ngenetic toolbox, some phages are recalcitrant to nucleases, either\nby inhibition (Acr proteins protecting the phages from CRISPR-\nCas) (Marino et al., 2018) or by genome shielding (Malone et al.,\n2020; Mendoza et al., 2020).\nFinally, a third line of progress consisted in performing the\ngenome modiﬁcations in vitro followed by phage “rebooting, ”\nwhere the entire phage genome is transformed into a recipient\nbacterium to yield viral particles (Ando et al., 2015; Kilcher et al.,\n2018). This bottom-up rebooting method requires a thorough\noptimization of transfection conditions and is very ineﬃcient\nfor phages with large genomes. Another avenue for rebooting\ncould be the cell-free TXTL protein synthesis of phages in vitro:\nsynthesis of T4 from the intact 170-kb genome T4 was recently\nreported, albeit with small yields (Rustad et al., 2018). Hence,\nno universal method seems to emerge for the editing of phages\nwith large genomes.\nOur laboratory studies bacteriophage T5, a virulent phage\nthat infects Escherichia coli and has a linear 121-kb dsDNA\ngenome. Most mutants in T5 were isolated in the past century\nafter chemical mutagenesis and screening for amber mutations\n(Lanni et al., 1966; Hendrickson and McCorquodale, 1971). Since\nthe 1980s, directed mutagenesis of T5 was also performed upon\ninfection of host strains carrying a plasmid with the desired\nmutation. Usually ca. 500-bp homologous DNA is provided on\neach side of the mutation to favor HR. Screening of plaques was\nperformed by PCR (Golomidova et al., 2016) or hybridization\nof radiolabeled oligonucleotides in stringent conditions (Vernhes\net al., 2017; Klimuk et al., 2020), a rather cumbersome method.\nA recent report raised doubts about the possibility to use CRISPR-\nCas for T5wt counterselection: T5 was reported to escape the\nCRISPR-Cas type I-E from E. coli. Accordingly, although most\nof the spacers incorporated into CRISPR arrays mapped to pre-\nearly genes, only few of them conferred protection against T5\n(Strotskaya et al., 2017). In this report, we tested the use of a Cas\nnuclease normally absent in E. coli, i.e., the type II-A nuclease\nCas9, for restricting T5 infection. We also describe an alternative\nmethod based on a scheme of dilutions for improved recovery\nof mutants. Finally, we tested the use of retrons as another\ntemplate for homologous recombination.

When appropriate, antibiotics\nwere used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 200µg/mL;\nchloramphenicol, 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 100 µg/mL. Prior to\nphage infections, cultures were supplemented with CaCl2 (1 mM)\nand MgCl2 (1 mM). T5 wild type (T5wt), T5 1dmp, T5 lacZα,\nand T5 PNmC were propagated in E. coli F. T5 amA1 SS84,\nT5 amA1 T28, and T5 amA2 S37 were ampliﬁed in E. coli\nCR63, which codes for an amber suppressorCUAtRNASer. Plaques\nwere visualized on a double agar layer using molten LB agar\n(0.5%) supplemented with the indicator bacteria and the phages.\nFor the blue/white screening of lysis plaques the molten top\nagar also contained X-Gal (0.6 mg/mL) and isopropyl β-D-1-\nthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 3 mM). For visualization of lysis\nplaques, plates were incubated at 37 ◦C overnight and, when\nappropriate, a further incubation at 25 ◦C for 24 h enhanced the\nblue color of the plaques.\nPlasmid Constructions\nPlasmid pAC9 was assembled from plasmids pCas9, pBAD24 and\npsgRNAcos (see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary\nFigure 1 ) by homologous recombination (Jacobus and Gross,\n2015).

PCR\nproducts were digested with DpnI for 1 h at 37 ◦C and puriﬁed.\nE. coli cells were transformed with 50 ng of each fragment and\nselected in LB agar with ampicillin or kanamycin.\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 667332\nfmicb-12-667332 April 20, 2021 Time: 15:56 # 3\nRamirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\nFor sgRNA cloning, sense and anti-sense oligonucleotides\n(Supplementary Table 2 ) were annealed using a temperature\ngradient from 98 ◦C to 20 ◦C at 0.1 ◦C/s, and then cloned into\npAC9 by the Golden-Gate method using the type IIs restriction\nenzyme BsaI (Werner et al., 2012).\nPlasmid pFFA1, used for retron-mediated mutagenesis, was\nobtained by PCR from the plasmid pFF745 with primers 3087\nand 3127, and subsequent religation in a Golden-Gate reaction\n(Werner et al., 2012).\nPlasmids used for HR were assembled with primers cited in\nSupplementary Table 1. In all cases, pUCGG was the recipient;\nthis plasmid was obtained by PCR (with primers pUCF/pUCR)\nusing pUC19 as the template, followed by religation. Inserts\nwere ampliﬁed, puriﬁed and cloned in pUCGG by the Golden-\nGate method. The QuikChange (QC) site-directed mutagenesis\nmethod was used to introduce speciﬁc mutations in the plasmids\nwhen needed (Deng and Nickoloﬀ, 1992). pUCDdmp was\nconstructed by cloning PCR products from T5 DNA (with primer\npairs dmpF2/DdmpR and DdmpF/dmpR2). pUCA1am was\nconstructed by cloning a PCR fragment ampliﬁed from T5 (using\nprimers GGA1TF/GGA1TR) and the subsequent introduction\nof a stop codon (QCA11/QCA12) at the A1 codon T28. For\npUCA2am, the ampliﬁed insert (ggpUCA2F/ggpUCA2R) was\ncloned in pUGG and the A2 codon S37 was then changed\nto stop codon (QCamA2F/QCamA2F). Plasmid pUC05-LacZa2\nwas constructed in two steps: the ﬁrst insert in pUCGG bears a T5\ngenome fragment comprising gene 05 ﬂanked by parts of genes\nA1 and A2, ampliﬁed by PCR (05F/05R); the resulting plasmid,\npUC05, was ampliﬁed (pUC05-F/pUC05-R) to clone lacZα\n(LacZalpha-ATG/LacZalpha-Stop) from pUC19. The EcoRI site\nin lacZα was erased (QC-LacZ-Eco1) and a Shine Dalgarno\nsequence was added (QCLacZSD1/QCLacZSD2) upstream to\nallow translation. For pUCPNmC construction, two inserts were\nfused, one from T5 (T5.151F/mCR) and the other one from\npET-PNter-mCherry (mCF/T5.151R).\nCRISPR-Cas9 Interference Assay\nEach host ( E. coli strains F or CR63) bearing a pAC9 with\nor without the spacer against T5wt was grown at 37 ◦C in LB\nsupplemented with kanamycin, calcium, and magnesium until\nan OD600∼0.4–0.5 was reached. 100 µL of serial dilutions of the\nphage and 100 µL of the host were added to the top agar of a\ndouble agar overlay assay in presence of kanamycin as well as\narabinose (0.4%) to induce the expression of Cas9. To measure\ninfection interference, the host and phage were E. coli F(pAC9)\nand T5wt; for CRISPR-Cas9 assisted counterselection of T5wt\nfollowing mutagenesis, E. coli CR63 carrying pAC9-derivatives\nwas infected with the lysate from HR.\nMutagenesis Using Plasmid Template for\nHomologous Recombination\nThe template plasmids used for phage mutagenesis are listed in\nTable 1. E. coli CR63 was transformed either with pUCA1am\n(to generate T5 amA1) or pUCA2am (for T5 amA2). E. coli\nXL-1 Blue was used along with pUC05-lacZa2 to generate\nT5 lacZα, while E. coli F was transformed with pUCPNmC\nto generate T5 PNmC. Precultures of the cited hosts were\nstarted from a single colony inoculated in LB with ampicillin,\nshaken overnight at 37 ◦C and diluted to OD 600 ∼0.1 in LB\nbroth supplemented with ampicillin, calcium and magnesium.\nCultures were shaken at 37 ◦C until they reached OD 600 0.4-\n0.5, and were then infected with T5 wt at MOI 10. After\n10 min at 37 ◦C, cells were washed twice through centrifugation\nat 5000 × g for 3 min and resuspension with LB broth\nsupplemented with ampicillin, calcium and magnesium. Cells\nwere harvested, resuspended at half of the initial volume, and\nincubated at 37◦C for 90 min. Then 0.2% chloroform was added\nto the culture, and following 10 min at 37 ◦C, the lysate was\ncentrifuged at 5000 × g 3 min. The supernatant was ﬁltered\nwith 0.45- µm cellulose acetate ﬁlters (Sartorius) and stored\nat 4◦C.\nMutagenesis Using Retron\nOvernight cultures of E. coli cells CR63(pFFA1) grown in LB\nsupplemented with chloramphenicol were used to initiate a 20-\nmL culture at OD 600 0.1 in LB broth with chloramphenicol\nand 1mM each of IPTG, CaCl 2 and MgSO 4. The culture was\nshaken at 37 ◦C and 220 rpm until the OD 600 reached 0.4, and\nthen T5wt was added at MOI 10. After 10 min at 37 ◦C, cells\nwere washed twice and resuspended in half the initial volume\nwith LB supplemented with chloramphenicol, IPTG, calcium\nand magnesium. Following 90 min at 37 ◦C, chloroform was\nadded and cell lysates were harvested as described above for the\nmutagenesis using plasmid templates.\nScreening of Mutant Phages\nFor the PCR screening of phages obtained after mutagenesis, we\nperformed a mismatched ampliﬁcation mutation assay (MAMA-\nPCR) (Cha et al., 1992). The sequence of primers for the detection\nof T5 amA1 (2772/A1Scr), T5 amA2 (05R/4050.2), T5 lacZα\n(LacZalpha-Stop/A2ATG), PNmC (mCF/104870) are shown in\nSupplementary Table 1. T5 1dmp mutants were screened with\nprimers T5:14-38F and 03ATG ( Supplementary Table 1), based\non the PCR amplicon size. Thermocycler conditions were set to\n98◦C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 55 ◦C (30 s) and 72 ◦C\n(1 min), and ﬁnally 5 min at 72 ◦C. PCR reactions contained\n10 µM of each desalted primer (Euroﬁns), DMSO 1.5%, 1 µL\nof ﬁltered lysate, and Taq DNA Polymerase 0.05 U/ µL with 1 ×\nBuﬀer with KCl (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).\nDilution-Ampliﬁcation-Screening (DAS)\nFigure 1 summarizes the diﬀerent steps in DAS. The lysate\nwas ﬁrst diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions to reach ca. 10–\n100 PFU/mL (usually up to a dilution factor of 10 8 to 10 10).\nEach dilution was performed in 10 mL of LB supplemented\nwith CaCl 2 (1mM) and MgSO 4 (1mM). A total of 50 µL of\neach dilution were then distributed in twelve wells of a 96-\nwell sterile ﬂat bottom polystyrene plate (Corning), one row\nper dilution factor. To amplify the phages in each well, one-\nhundred-µL aliquots of a CR63 bacterial culture in exponential\nphase were added. The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 ◦C\nwhile shaking at 220 rpm. For the ﬁrst screening by MAMA-\nPCR, we pooled 20 µL from six wells in the same row.

Finally, 50µL taken from a PCR-\npositive well were plated on a double agar to test 10-20 lysis\nplaques individually.\nFluorescence Microscopy\nTo observe the production of the late viral proteins by\nﬂuorescence microscopy, E. coli strain F was incubated at 37 ◦C\nin LB supplemented with ampicillin, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2, until\nit reached an OD 600 of 0.4. To synchronize the infections,\nthe cells were chilled at 4 ◦C for 15 min. Phage T5 PNmC\nwas added to the culture at a MOI of 5 and incubated\nfor 5 min at 4 ◦C. The infected cells were washed by\ncentrifugation at 5000 × g for 3 min and resuspension in\nLB. An aliquot of the culture was taken every 10 min and\nﬁxed with the same volume of PFA solution (Formaldehyde\n5%, Glutaraldehyde 0.06%, diluted in PBS buﬀer) for 20 min.\nFixed cells were washed in PBS buﬀer (NaCl 0.14 M, KCl\n2.68 mM, Na 2HPO4 6.46 mM, KH 2PO4 1.15 mM) twice by\ncentrifugation-resuspension. The cells were ﬁnally resuspended\nin PBS and stored at 4 ◦C until microscopy imaging. Fixed cells\nwere deposited on thin agarose pads (1% molecular-biology-\ngrade agarose in PBS) molded on glass slide and observed under\ncover slips with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1/7 microscope using the\nZEN software, version 3.0. The objective was Plan Apochromat\n63x/1.40 Oil Ph 3 M27. The exposure time was 200 ms for\nmCherry mPlum HXP (Ex: 587 nm, Em: 610 nm) and 20 ms\nfor phase contrast.\nRESULTS\nRestriction of T5 Infection by\nCRISPR-Cas9 Depends on the Targeted\nLocus\nTo test whether phage T5 infection is restricted by CRISPR-\nCas9, we transformed E. coli F with a plasmid coding for the\nnuclease Cas9 and customizable sgRNAs. The sgRNAs matched\ndiﬀerent locations across the ﬁrst 10 kb of the T5 phage genome.\nBy double-layer agar method, we compared the titer of a T5\nstock on two host strains: E. coli F expressing both Cas9 and\neach sgRNA, versus the same host lacking the sgRNA. The\nratio of PFUs between the two hosts constituted the eﬃciency\nof plating (EOP) and reﬂected the protective capacity of Cas9\nagainst phages (Strotskaya et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017) for\neach sgRNA. Restriction of T5 infection varied across the tested\nregion regardless of the DNA strand that was targeted (Figure 2).\nSpacers with the highest interference mapped to the genes dmp,\n02, A1, 05, and 07 and lowered the titer of T5wt between 10 and\n100 times. The other spacers did not provide protection as the\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 667332\nfmicb-12-667332 April 20, 2021 Time: 15:56 # 5\nRamirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\nFIGURE 2 | Restriction of phage T5 infection by sgRNA-guided Cas9. The restriction of T5 infection was measured as the efﬁciency of plating (EOP), calculated as\nthe titer of T5 on sgRNA- and Cas9-containing hosts versus the titer on the same host lacking the sgRNA. Titers were determined by plaque assay. EOP using\nspacers matching the positive or negative strand were highlighted in black or blue, respectively. Each point represents the mean and s.e.m. from three replicas.\nAbove the graph is the genetic organization of the ﬁrst 11 kb from the 121-kb genome: green arrows highlight genes A1 and A2 which are predicted to be essential\nbased on the phenotype of amber mutations genetically mapped in the 1960s.\ntiter of T5wt decreased less than ten times. Therefore, Cas9 could\nbe eﬃciently used to restrict T5wt infection when it was targeted\nto a region within the ﬁrst 4.5 kb of the T5 genome.\nBacteriophage T5 Genome Editing\nThrough HR Plus CRISPR-Cas9\nIn order to introduce genetic modiﬁcations in T5, we focused\non the region with eﬀective spacers. In the late sixties, Lanni\nand coworkers described the isolation of T5 amber mutants\nthat could only be propagated in an amber suppressive strain\n(Lanni et al., 1966; Lanni, 1968). Mutations were genetically\nmapped to A1 or A2 genes ( Figure 2 ) but no sequencing data\nwere obtained to conﬁrm this ﬁnding. Therefore, we decided\nto introduce a stop codon early on in the open reading frame\nof the gene A1, resulting in the synthesis of truncated A1 (27\namino acids instead of 556). A 1-kb fragment of the T5 genome\nwas ampliﬁed and cloned into a pUC19 plasmid. This fragment\ncomprises 500-bp on each side of the A1 start codon in order\nto provide ample homologous sequences on either side of the\ndesired mutation, and the codon for T28 in the insert was\nreplaced with a stop codon. Phage mutagenesis was performed by\nallowing infection of E. coliCR63 carrying the resulting plasmid.\nCounterselection of the T5wt within the crude lysate was carried\nout onto E. coli CR63(pAC9-A1), a strain that expressed Cas9\nand a sgRNA directed against the wild-type A1 gene at the same\nsite where the amber mutation was introduced ( Figure 3A ).\nThe crude lysate and CR63(pAC9-A1) were mixed prior to\nplating onto double agar plate. The resulting plaques were then\npicked and patched onto both E. colistrains F (non-permissive)\nand CR63 (amber-suppressive). We recovered six amber mutant\nplaques in 100 patched ones ( Figure 3B). Sequencing conﬁrmed\nthe introduction of the intended mutation in the T5 amA1\nphages (Figure 3C).\nThe T5 genome has two long terminal direct repeats (ca.\n10kb) that each include a copy of the 17 pre-early genes\n(Genome accession NC_005859.1). To test whether phages\nmutated in pre-early genes were modiﬁed on both terminal\nrepeats, we performed a mutagenesis to delete the dispensable\nT5 pre-early gene dmp (Mozer et al., 1977). To provide a\ntemplate for HR, we generated plasmid pUCDdmp, that carries\na 702-bp deletion of dmp ﬂanked by T5 sequences. For T5\nmutagenesis, E. colistrain F (pUCDdmp) was ﬁrst infected with\nT5 and then CRISPR-Cas9 counterselection of the crude lysate\nwas done with E. coli F(pAC9_dmp) that produced a sgRNA\ndirected against wild-type dmp. PCR screening of 100 plaques\nidentiﬁed ﬁve plaques that bore the mutation (not shown). Using\nprimers that anneal to both terminal repeats ( Figure 3D ), we\ncould amplify a fragment corresponding to deleted version of\ndmp (Figures 3E,F). Therefore, the genome modiﬁcations were\nintroduced in both terminal repeats. Taken together, our results\ndemonstrate that it is possible to use sgRNA-guided Cas9 to\nfacilitate mutant screening after HR in the genome of T5.\nBacteriophage Genome Engineering\nWith Retrons\nWe explored the use of alternative forms of DNA templates for\nphage genome engineering. Bacterial retroelements or retrons are\nchimeric RNA/DNA molecules composed of covalently linked\nssRNA (msr) and ssDNA (msd). Both msr and msd are coded\nin the same cistron, altogether with a reverse transcriptase\nresponsible for the partial reverse transcription and linking of\nthe msr-msd molecules (Simon et al., 2019). These elements can\nprovide ssDNA in vivofor gene modiﬁcation, and were used for\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 667332\nfmicb-12-667332 April 20, 2021 Time: 15:56 # 6\nRamirez-Chamorro et al.

We tested whether retrons\nare also eﬀective for phage genome engineering. For the retron\ntemplate, we modiﬁed plasmid pFF745, which codes for the msr,\nmsd and the reverse transcriptase in a polycistron controlled by\nan IPTG inducible promoter (Farzadfard and Lu, 2014). Part\nof the msd sequence was replaced with a 75-bp segment of\nthe viral A1 gene centered on the serine codons for S84 and\nS85. These codons were substituted by stop codons, generating\nplasmid pFFA1. To introduce the mutation A1 S84Stop/S85Stop\ninto the phage genome, we grew E. coli CR63(pFFA1) in the\npresence of IPTG and infected the bacteria with the wild-type\nphage.

Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\nFIGURE 4 | Retron-mediated mutagenesis. (A) Current model for retron-mediated mutagenesis. Retrons consist in covalently linked RNA (black line) and\nreverse-transcribed ssDNA (green). For mutagenesis purposes, retrons are modiﬁed to carry 75 nucleotides homologous to the target DNA (thick green line) with a\nmutation (red box). Thus, retrons provide the cell with a source of ssDNA, that together with the Red-Beta protein from phage lambda, anneals to the target DNA\nduring replication. (B) Sequencing of the phage T5 amA1 SS84 constructed by retron-mediated recombination: puriﬁed amber mutant phages T5 amA1 SS84\nobtained by retron-mediated mutagenesis were used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation. Amplicon sequences showed the presence of two stop codons instead of\nserine codons (S84 and S85) in the T5 A1 gene.\nthe unmodiﬁed codons S84/S85 of T5 A1. Mutant screening\nwas performed by picking 100 plaques and patching them onto\nplates seeded with E. coli strains F or CR63. We recovered 2\nout of 100 plaques that could only lyse the amber-suppressing\nhost strain. Such mutants were designated T5amA1 SS84. Sanger\nsequencing results showed the correct introduction of mutations\nin A1 and no other alteration in the targeted locus ( Figure 4B).\nOur results suggest that retrons could be eﬀectively used for\nphage genome engineering.\nDilution-Ampliﬁcation-Screening to\nIsolate Mutants From Phage T5\nAs we have seen above, some regions of the T5 genome are not\namenable to the CRISPR-Cas9 counterselection, a feature that\nenriches the phage progeny in mutants relative to wild type after\nmutagenesis. We reasoned that a similar enrichment could be\nachieved with a simple dilution-ampliﬁcation screening (DAS)\n(Figure 5A). As a proof of principle for this procedure, we sought\nto obtain a phage carrying an amber mutation in the essential\ngene A2 at the codon S37. We allowed the recombination between\nthe phage T5 and the plasmid bearing a mutated copy of the gene\nA2 during infection. Following ﬁltration to eliminate uninfected\nbacteria, the crude lysate was serially diluted from ca. 10 10\nPFU/mL down to 10 2 PFU/mL. We distributed each dilution\ninto several wells containing the amber-suppressive host and\nincubated for 3 h to amplify the phages ( Figures 1 , 5A). We\nscreened the wells by mismatched ampliﬁcation mutation assay\n(MAMA)-PCR to detect the mutation and the positive wells were\nplated by a double agar layer method to obtain individual plaques.\nThe plaques were picked and patched successively onto two plates\nwith a non-permissive and a permissive host, respectively. The\nplaques that lysed only the permissive host were considered\npositive ( Figure 5B ). We recovered 6 positives mutants from\n50 tested, from which one was conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing\n(Figure 5C). Since our estimation of T5 recombination frequency\nis around 0.25% (see below), our recovery rate of 12% indicates\nthat we could enrich the mutant in some pools enough to simplify\nthe recovery of T5 amA2 S37 mutants. Hence, DAS is an eﬃcient\nmethod for mutant isolation.\nBlue T5: Insertion of lacZα Gene Into the\nT5 Genome\nFollowing the successful introduction of point mutations in the\nT5 genome, we further tested whether insertion of exogenous\ngenes was possible. To generate a T5 phage that produces blue\nlysis plaques, a 270-bp ORF encoding the fragment LacZ α of the\nE. coliβ-galactosidase was introduced by HR between the genes\n05 and A1 and DAS was used to recover mutants (Figure 6). The\nT5 lacZα (Blue T5) plaques were blue when plated in a soft agar\noverlay with the strain E. coliXL-1 Blue in the presence of X-Gal\nand IPTG ( Figure 6B ). When we skipped the DAS procedure\nand relied only on the blue/white plaque screening, we were\nable to measure the frequency of recombination in T5 by HR.\nWe counted the number of blue lysis plaques obtained from the\nﬁltered crude lysate and found that 0.27 ± 0.01% (n = 6) of the\nphages were recombinants, i.e., had integrated the lacZα gene.\nIn T4, the frequency of recombinant phages recovered following\ninfection of cells carrying the template DNA on a plasmid was\nreported to be between 0.1 and 0.5% (Völker and Showe, 1980),\nwhile in T3, it is comprised between 0.1 and 1% (Yehl et al., 2019).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 667332\nfmicb-12-667332 April 20, 2021 Time: 15:56 # 8\nRamirez-Chamorro et al. Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\nFIGURE 5 | Screening of T5 mutants by Dilution-Ampliﬁcation-Screening (DAS). (A) DAS principle: following mutagenesis, mutants are far less abundant than\nwild-type phages in the crude lysates. In the ﬁrst step, dilutions of the lysates are performed to lower the phage titers and alter the proportion of mutants present in\neach pool (above, second row). In the second step, phages in the diluted pools are ampliﬁed by adding the host. While the mutants remain scant within ampliﬁed\npools from initial high viral titers (below, ﬁrst row), the modiﬁed phages become enriched in the progeny obtained with some of the highly diluted pools (below,\nsecond row).

The product of T5 gene 151, the late protein\npb10, is a two-domain protein that decorates the surface of the T5\ncapsid. Although dispensable for capsid assembly, it contributes\nto its stability under high temperature (Vernhes et al., 2017).\nThe N-ter domain of pb10 that binds to speciﬁc sites on the\ncapsid was fused to mCherry ( Figures 7A,C ). Mutant phages\nwere recovered and could be used to monitor the timing of late\nprotein production during infection by ﬂuorescence microscopy.\nThere was a rapid rise of red ﬂuorescence inside the cells after\naround 20 min of infection ( Figure 7B ), consistent with the\nexpected late synthesis of the PNmC fusion.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this work, we have edited the genome of bacteriophage\nT5 and could generate mutants carrying point mutations, a\ndeletion or insertions. Template DNA for mutagenesis was\nprovided on a plasmid with ca. 500-bp homologous DNA on\neither side to facilitate homologous recombination, a classical\nmethod used for the genome engineering of many phages (Pires\net al., 2016). Here, we also chose to test an alternative template\nDNA, i.e., bacterial retroelements called retrons. Retrons code\nfor mixed, covalently linked molecules constituted by single-\nstranded RNA and DNA, msd-msr, which can provide ssDNA\nmolecules in vivo. They were successfully used for gene editing\nof E. coli cells expressing the lambda recombinase Red-Beta\n(Simon et al., 2019). Although the mechanism of mutagenesis\nby msd-msr molecules remains unknown, it has been suggested\nthat the ssDNA produced from msd-msr cleavage replaces\nOkasaki fragments during replication leading to the introduction\nof modiﬁcations in the genome (Farzadfard and Lu, 2014).\nRetrons were used in the past to modify the bacterial genome\nupon exposure of the cells to certain stimuli (Farzadfard and\nLu, 2014) or to continuously target speciﬁc sequences in the\nbacterial genome to drive evolution (Simon et al., 2018). To\nour knowledge, our report is the ﬁrst example of phage genome\nediting using retrons. Since the completion of this work, an\narticle described that some retrons, including the Ec86 retron\nused in this study, provide protection against T5 infection,\nalbeit in a diﬀerent E. coli strain background (Millman et al.,\n2020). Because the mechanism of host defense provided by\nEc86 retron was not studied further, it is not clear whether\nthe replacement of 75 nucleotides in msd by a heterologous\nsequence is enough to inactivate the retron-mediated protection.\nTherefore, prior to undertaking retron-mediated mutagenesis,\nregardless whether the hosts are Gram-negative or Gram-positive\nbacteria, it might be useful to test the eﬀect of retron expression\nFIGURE 7 | Gene fusion encoding a chimeric protein between the ﬁrst half of the late protein Pb10 and a ﬂuorescent protein.(A) Map of a segment of the capsid\ngene locus in the genome of T5 PNmC mutant: the 3’ end of the gene encoding Pb10 was replaced by a sequence encoding mCherry.

Expanding the Toolkit for Phage Genome Editing\non the outcome of phage infection. In our study, the small\nsize of the homologous domain (75-bp) is incompatible with\ninsertions of large sequences in the genome but was suﬃcient\nto successfully introduce point mutations in T5 (here two stop\ncodons). Nevertheless, mutagenesis with retrons oﬀers several\nadvantages. First, directed mutagenesis of cloned fragments is\nnot necessary since the retron’s small size allows the cloning\nof annealed oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations.\nSecond, unlike the classical templates for HR, there is no\nneed to provide long sequences ﬂanking the mutations which\nmight encode toxic products for the host cell. Further work\nwill test whether retrons can also be used to construct gene\ndeletions in phages.\nReported phage homologous recombination frequencies vary\nwidely from 10 −10 to 10 −2 depending on the phages and\nthe genes that are targeted (Pires et al., 2016). These rates\nwarrant eﬃcient screening strategies of the phage progeny after\nmutagenesis. One common approach is the targeted elimination\nof wild-type phage using interference by CRISPR-Cas. Mutant\nphages are thus enriched within the phage population (Kiro\net al., 2014; Martel and Moineau, 2014; Tao et al., 2017; Hupfeld\net al., 2018). Using Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting genes within\nthe ﬁrst 4.5 kb of T5 DNA, we were successful in isolating\nconditional mutants in the essential geneA1 and a mutant deleted\nin the dispensable gene dmp. Interestingly, PCR ampliﬁcation\nshowed that the latter mutant was modiﬁed on both direct\nterminal repeats. Although the mechanisms for T5 replication\nare poorly understood, duplication of a terminal repeat during\nthe packaging of concatemeric DNA has been proposed (Casjens\nand Gilcrease, 2009). We speculate that, in the case of a\nduplicated gene located outside of the terminal repeats, the\nmutagenesis outcome would not have necessarily led to the\nmodiﬁcations of both genes.\nDespite some success with sgRNA-guided Cas9, we found\nthat interference was not uniform when we targeted diﬀerent\nlocations across the pre-early gene locus, something similar to\nwhat was been seen in T4 (Tao et al., 2017). While T4 DNA is\npartially protected through the modiﬁcation of cytosines with\n5-hydroxymethylation plus glycosylation, no modiﬁcation of T5\nDNA has been reported so far. This resistance to CRISPR-\nCas interference was not limited to Cas9 nuclease: indeed a\nrecent study of the impact of CRISPR-Cas type I-E against\nT5 showed that the few eﬃcient spacers matched pre-early\ngene sequences but not the rest of the genome (Strotskaya\net al., 2017). These observations suggest that there might be\na generalized way, other than base modiﬁcation, in which T5\nmanages to escape CRISPR-Cas nucleases. A similar observation\nin jumbo phages led to the discovery of a viral proteinaceous shell\nthat protects phage DNA from nucleases (Malone et al., 2020;\nMendoza et al., 2020). However, whether phage T5 uses a similar\nmechanism is unknown.\nFor phages resistant to CRISPR-Cas interference, we have\nestablished an alternative enrichment method by Dilution,\nAmpliﬁcation, and Screening (DAS). The strategy relies on\nthe dilution of the viral progeny into parallel pools, followed\nby their ampliﬁcation in the host. Screening of the most\ndilute pools occurs using a discriminative PCR. This method\nwas successful in isolating conditional as well as insertion\nmutants of bacteriophage T5. In this work we generated a\nbacteriophage mutant useful to detect late viral gene expression\nin ﬂuorescence microscopy of E. coli infected by T5. We also\nused DAS to generate a phage carrying a 270-bp lacZα gene\namong the early genes of T5. This phage was easily trackable\nwhen infecting E. colicells designed for alpha complementation\nof beta-galactosidase activity, since its blue plaques are easily\ndistinguished from colorless plaques. Using this phenotype, we\nwere able to determine the recombination frequency of T5, which\nis similar to that of T3 (Yehl et al., 2019) and T4 (Völker and\nShowe, 1980). Such an easily trackable phage could prove useful\nin competition assays with other phages in the future. Finally,\nwe believe that DAS can document that some genes targeted for\nmutagenesis are essential for infection, as the phages carrying the\nmutation after HR will not propagate during the ampliﬁcation\nstep and therefore will only be abundant in the least diluted pools.\nFor this type of analysis, the PCR reactions should only allow the\ndetection of the mutation within the phage genome and not the\none provided on the plasmid DNA used as template.\nTaken together, our work has shown that retrons and DAS\nwere successful tools in the mutagenesis of T5, a phage with a\nlarge genome mostly recalcitrant to CRISPR-Cas nucleases. These\ntools are likely welcome additions to the biotechnological toolkit\nfor phage genome editing.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nLR-C, PB, and OR contributed to conception and design of the\nstudy, and analyzed the data.

These enzymes were first\ndiscovered in RNA tumor viruses in 1970, but it was not until 1989 that they were found in prokaryotes as a key component\nof retrons. Apart from RTs encoded by the ‘selfish’ mobile retroelements known as group II introns, prokaryotic RTs are\nextraordinarily diverse, but their function has remained elusive. However, recent studies have revealed that different\nlineages of prokaryotic RTs, including retrons, those associated with CRISPR-Cas systems, Abi-like RTs and other yet\nuncharacterized RTs, are key components of different lines of defense against phages and other mobile genetic elements.\nProkaryotic RTs participate in various antiviral strategies, including abortive infection (Abi), in which the infected cell is\ninduced to commit suicide to protect the host population, adaptive immunity, in which a memory of previous infection is\nused to build an efficient defense, and other as yet unidentified mechanisms. These prokaryotic enzymes are attracting\nconsiderable attention, both for use in cutting-edge technologies, such as genome editing, and as an emerging research\ntopic. In this review, we discuss what is known about prokaryotic RTs, and the exciting evidence for their domestication\nfrom retroelements to create specialized defense systems.\nReceived: 15 January 2021;Accepted: 7 May 2021\nC⃝ The Author(s) 2021.

However, it\nleft open the possibility that information could be transferred\nfrom RNA to DNA (Crick1958). The discovery of enzymes capa-\nble of synthesizing DNA from an RNA template demonstrated\nthis hypothesis (Crick1970). RNA-dependent DNA polymerases,\nalso known as reverse transcriptases (RTs), were discovered in\n1970 in RNA tumor viruses (Baltimore1970; Temin and Mizu-\ntani1970), and this finding reshaped existing views on the func-\ntioning of all forms of life. In prokaryotes, RTs were discovered\nalmost 20 years later as a key component of retrons (Lampson\net al.1989; Lim and Maas1989). Currently, prokaryotic RTs dis-\nplay an extraordinary diversity, with most of them (80%) classi-\nfied into three main groups: those encoded by group II introns,\nretron/retron-like sequences and diversity-generating retroele-\nments (DGRs). The remaining RT sequences form distinct lin-\neages, including those associated with CRISPR-Cas systems,\nabortive phage infection systems (Abi-like) and other unchar-\nacterized RTs clustering in the so-called G2L (group-II-like) and\nunknowngroups(UG;Toro etal. 2019a).WhiletheRTsofeukary-\notes and viruses have been characterized in detail, it has taken\nover 30 years for us to begin to understand the function and\nmechanisms of the highly diverse RTs of prokaryotic organisms\n(Fig. 1).\nRecent investigations have shown that several prokaryotic\nRT lineages have evolved to provide new strategies for deal-\ning with phages. Thus, together with Abi-RTs (Fortier, Bouchard\nand Moineau 2005; Odegrip, Nilsson and Hagg˚ard-Ljungquist\n2006; Durmaz and Klaenhammer2007) and CRISPR-RTs (Kojima\nand Kanehisa2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014), searches for\nnew antiviral immunity systems in defense islands have led to\nthe discovery of anti-phage properties in a majority of retron\ntypes, and several RTs from uncharacterized groups (Gaoet al.\n2020; Millmanet al.2020). The relevance of these enzymes also\nlies in the use of different RT lineages as promising tools for\ndiverse applications, including genome editing, recombination-\nmediated genetic engineering applications and the recording of\nbiological information in bacterial genomes (Schmidt, Cherep-\nkova and Platt2018; Belfort and Lambowitz2019; Simon, Elling-\nton and Finkelstein 2019). These potential uses have boosted\ninterest in these prokaryotic enzymes and their associated sys-\ntems.\nGroup II intron-RTs are the best-characterized in prokary-\notes(FeratandMichel 1993;LambowitzandZimmerly 2011),but\nvery little is known about their ecological role. These mobile\nretroelements are generally considered to be selfish units, but\na few studies have provided evidence to suggest that they\ncan disrupt other mobile genetic elements (MGE), participat-\ning in host defense against these potentially harmful elements\n(Chill´on, Mart´ınez-Abarca and Toro2011;Q u et al.2018). DGRs\nprovide their hosts with an adaptive advantage due to the great\nsequence variation that they cause in a target gene through a\nmutagenicreversetranscriptionreaction(Liu etal. 2002;W uetal.\n2018). The wide range of functions performed by DGRs have yet\nto be elucidated, but they are known to participate in tropism\nswitching and signaling pathways potentially involved in virus–\nhost interactions. Thus, our current knowledge of prokaryotic\nRTs suggests that they tend to be domesticated to perform\nimmune functions in the host cell through a wide range of bio-\nlogical mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. The\noverall purpose of this review is to highlight the role of prokary-\notic RTs in immunity to phages and MGEs mediated by selfish\ngenetic elements to more specialized systems, and to summa-\nrize the use of these enzymes in cutting-edge technologies.\nGroups of prokaryotic RTs\nGroup II introns\nGroup II introns were first identified in the mitochondrial and\nchloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes and plants. They were\nnot found in prokaryotes until 1993, and their mobility has\nsincebeencharacterizedindetail(FeratandMichel 1993;Michel\nand Ferat1995; Dai and Zimmerly2003; Toro2003; Lambowitz\nand Zimmerly 2004). Group II introns are self-splicing RNAs\nthat require an ancient form of RT to act as mobile retroele-\nments. This type of RT is the most abundant form in bacteria,\naccountingforalmost50%oftotalRTdiversity(Toro etal. 2019a).\nBacterial group II introns generally insert into sequences out-\nside of essential genes or into non-essential genes, and show\nan extinction–recolonization dynamics suggesting that they are\ndeleterious to the host (Leclercq and Cordaux2012). With few\nexceptions, these introns are typically found as only one or two\ncopies per genome (Dai and Zimmerly2002). This tendency for\ngroup II introns to be deleterious may drive the domestication\nof RT-containing genes, and their conversion into non-mobile\nRTs, presumably with novel functions (Fig.2). Indeed, although\ngroup II introns have given rise to more complex retroelements\nsuchaseukaryoticnon-LTRretrotransposons,theyarealsocon-\nsidered the evolutionary ancestors of the spliceosome complex\nand the telomerase, which represent greats examples of how\ngroup II introns could generate new functions by domestication\n(Box 1).\nGroup II introns consist of a catalytic RNA, with characteris-\ntic conserved 5\n′-a n d3′-end sequences, GUGYG and AY, respec-\ntively, resembling those of spliceosomal eukaryotic introns, and\nan intron-encoded protein (IEP; Lambowitz and Zimmerly2011).\nCatalytic intron RNAs have a conserved secondary structure\nof 400–800 nts in length and organized into six domains, DI–\nVI, radiating from a central ‘wheel’ (Michel, Costa and Westhof\n2009). The IEPs, which are encoded in DIV, have several different\ndomains involved in group II intron retromobility (Lambowitz\nand Zimmerly 2004): an N-terminal RT domain, an X domain\nor maturase involved in facilitating RNA splicing, a D domain\ninvolved in DNA binding and a metal-dependent DNA endonu-\nclease domain of the HNH family that cleaves a target DNA\nstrand to generate the primer for reverse transcription (San Fil-\nippo and Lambowitz2002). However, a large number of bacterial\ngroup II introns encode IEPs without an endonuclease domain.\nThebeststudiedofintronsthatlackthisdomainisthe Sinorhizo-\nbium melilotiRmInt1, which uses a mechanism associated with\nDNAreplicationtoprimereversetranscription(Mart ´ınez-Abarca\net al.2004;G a r c´ıa-Rodr´ıguez et al.2019).\nThe mobility of group II introns requires RNA splicing via\ntwo transesterification reactions, the first of which starts with\na nucleophilic attack of 2\n′-OH on a bulged adenosine in DVI,\nwith the second reaction resulting in the generation of an\nexcised intron lariat and exon ligation (Fig.3A). The IEP facil-\nitates this stage, by acting as a maturase, with the RT and X\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 3\nFigure 1.TimelineofresearchonprokaryoticRTs . Overthelastalmost40yearssincethediscoveryofasmallDNAsatellite in1984,whichturnedouttobesynthesized\nby an RT, research in this field has expanded spectacularly. Here, we show the main breakthroughs concerning the various functional groups of prokaryotic RTs.\ndomains functioning together to bind the intron RNA specifi-\ncally, thereby promoting the formation of a stable ribonucleo-\nprotein (RNP) complex (Belfort and Lambowitz2019). This active\nribozyme can migrate to new DNA targets in the host genome\nby a process involving a target-primed reverse transcription\n(TPRT) mechanism, in which the RT domain synthesizes the\nintron cDNA of the reverse-spliced intron RNA in one strand\nof a double-stranded-DNA target site (Lambowitz and Zimmerly\n2011). Intron mobility can occur via retrotransposition, wherein\nthe intron is introduced into ectopic sites, but the principal\nmobility pathway of group II introns is retrohoming, in which\nthe intron is inserted into a target region of the host genome\n(Belfort and Lambowitz2019).\nDespite detailed characterization of the mobility path-\nways of group II introns, the ecological implications of these\nretroelements in host cells are poorly understood, with only\na few studies published to date. Group II introns, which are\nconsidered to be selfish elements, tend to localize at higher\ndensities on plasmids than on chromosomes and frequently\nhideinotherMGEs,suchasothergroupIIintrons,abroadrange\nof transposases and some phage-related proteins, disrupting\nthese elements and their functions (Waldernet al.2020). In one\nstudy, following the acquisition of the RmInt1 group II intron by\nconjugative transfer, the colonization of homing sites, typically\ninsertion sequences (IS Rm2011-2 and close homologs), was\nfound to occur at high frequency via the preferred retrohoming\npathway, with sites located on the template for lagging-strand\nsynthesis invaded first, followed by those on the leading strand\ntemplate (Nisa-Mart´ınez et al. 2007). The splicing of RmInt1\nnaturally inserted into an IS interrupting a transposase gene is\nalmost completely abolished, but this intron retains its invasion\ncapacity, suggesting that group II introns may, to some extent,\ncontrol the spread of other MGEs (Chill´on, Mart´ınez-Abarca and\nToro 2011). These findings suggest that group II introns may\nhave an evolutionary role in circumventing splicing, preventing\nthe mobility of harmful elements in the bacterial cell and\nforming a particular defense system.\nConsistentwiththishypothesis,anothergroupIIintroninte-\ngrated into a relaxase gene on a conjugative plasmid has been\nshown to inhibit host gene expression and to restrain the natu-\nrally cohabiting mobile element, preventing its conjugative hor-\nizontal transfer by decreasing the levels of spliced mRNA (Qu\net al.2018). This process seems to function as a defensive bar-\nrier, limiting the spread of other mobile elements acting as gen-\neral inhibitors of gene expression. However, the relaxase stim-\nulates intron dispersal by nicking the conjugative plasmid and\n4 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6\nFigure 2. RT domestication from an ancestral retroelement. The scheme depicts a hypothetical scenario of the domestication of the different RT lineages from an\nautonomous mobile retroelement, probably an ancestral group II intron. The RNA domains (I–VI) as well as the exon regions (E1 and E2) and the differentdomains of\nthe intron encoded protein (RT: Reverse Transcriptase; X: Maturase; D: DNA-binding and En: Endonuclease) are indicated. At some point, the intron RNA component\nwas lost, and the remaining RTs coevolved with their genomic context, resulting in the recruitment of RTs to various specialized systems. The G2L RTs may represent\nan intermediate state between a mobile group II intron and a domestication of these RTs leading to nascent functional associations. Here, an example of a putative\nassociation between G2L-RTs and a multicomponent system comprised by the queousine biosynthesis pathway QueA, QueC, QueE (queuosine biosynthesispathway)\nand FGE-s (FGE sulfatase), YaaA (DNA-binding protein) and Gly (Glycosyltransferase) proteins is shown. The RTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systemspresent different\nstages of association: first a group II intron was inserted into the genomic context of acas1 gene. Following a loss of mobility, the remaining RT coevolved with\ncas1, resulting in a functional association. Subsequently, RT and Cas1 were fused and, later, a Cas6 domain was acquired independently. Alternatively, the RT and\nAEP primase domain (PrimS) may have fused to form a particular group of RT-CRISPR systems. DGR RTs have evolved to hypermutate the variable region (VR) of\nseveral target genes with a specific fold domain and through a mutagenic reverse transcription of a target region (TR). DGRs are typically assisted by various ancillary\nproteins including Avd (Accessory variability determinant), HRDC (Helicase and RNaseD C-terminal domain), MSL (MutS-like) and CH1 (Conserver Hypothetical Gene\n1). In the case of retrons, RTs have become associated with small ncRNAs and an effector module, some of them forming tripartite toxin/antitoxin systems with\nantiviral properties. The wide variety of effectors suggests that the retron unit is highly modular and, in some cases, the RT and other domains have fused (TOPRIM:\ntopoisomerase-primase;DUF3800;peptidaseandTIR:toll-interleukinreceptor).TheRTsfromtheAbi-like/UGlineagearehighlydivergentandphy logeneticallydistant\nfrom those of group II introns, suggesting that this lineage may represent an old domestication event, creating a new mechanism of defense against phages. The Abi\nRTs are fused to unknown domains, except for AbiA, in which the RT is fused to a HEPN domain. Most RTs from the UG lineage remain uncharacterized, but some\nhave been shown to confer resistance to phages and are now known as defense-associated RTs (DRTs). DRTs may consist of the RT itself, but the RT is also often fused\nto a nitrilase domain or associated with other RT proteins. The arrows denote events that have been inferred during the domestication of the differentRT lineages.\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 5\nFigure 3.Role of RTs in prokaryotic immunity. (A), Group II intron life cycle. The RNA domains (I–VI) as well as the exon regions (E1 and E2) and the RT and homing\nnuclease domains of intron encoded protein are indicated. Intron splicing steps form a lariat RNA which constitute a complex with the IEP. As soon as thet a r g e t\nDNA is found, intron reverse splices into the target DNA, frequently a mobile genetic element, abolishing its mobility via a process termed retrohoming. (B), Retrons\nare tripartite modular systems, some of which have been shown to act as toxin/antitoxin systems. The retron unit is comprised by a non-coding RNA (ncRNA)\nand the RT gene. The RT produces an msDNA at high copy number using the ncRNA as template. This msDNA remaining bound to the RT, forming the antitoxin\nunit. The effector module, formed by one or more genes with different enzymatic functions, constituting the toxin effector, is inhibited by direct contact with the\nantitoxin. By an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, when a phage infects the cell, triggers the msDNA processing/degradation, allowing the toxin to cause cell\ndeath, to protect cell population. (C), Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) introduce random mutations into the template repeat (TR), in a reaction known as\nmutagenic reverse transcription, which is performed by the RT with the help of an ancillary protein (typically Avd: Accessory variability determinant). The mutated\ncDNA is then integrated into the variable region (VR) of a target gene (TG), generating considerable sequence variability. The TG generally encodes aprotein displaying\nprotein–protein interactions or with surface activities enabling the host cell to adapt to different conditions, such as host–phage interactions.(D), RTs associated with\nRNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas systems (type III and VI) form an integrase complex together with Cas1 and Cas2, facilitating the acquisition of RNA molecules, which are\nintegrated into the CRISPR array as a new spacer. (E), RTs involved in abortive infection (Abi) systems are part of AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2, but their mechanisms of action\nremain unknown. In AbiA, the RT is fused to a HEPN domain and is thought to degrade host or phage RNA to confer resistance. In AbiK, a random-sequence DNA\nmoleculeremainscovalentlyattachedtoanOH-grouponatyrosineresidueintheRTdomain,whichisfusedtoanunknowndomain.AbiKusesanasyetincom pletely\nundeciphered mechanism to block phage Sak proteins, conferring immunity. Abi-P2, which has demonstrated reverse transcriptase activity, is formed by a RT and a\ndomain of unknown function capable of excluding phages by an as yet undetermined mechanism.

Thus, the relaxase facil-\nitates plasmid dispersal and retrotransposition events, whereas\nthe group II intron regulates relaxase expression, maintaining a\nbalance that may be positive for the host.\nContrasting with this inhibitory function, one recent study\nshowed that group II introns could increase genetic diver-\nsity by creating chimeric relaxase variants through the shuf-\nfling of coding sequences in RNA and DNA, thereby showing\nthat these retroelements can be beneficial to the conjugative\nelements that harbor them and to their bacterial host (LaRoche-\nJohnston, Bosan and Cousineau2020). Moreover, the existence\nof host factors acting as global regulators of intron mobility has\nbeen demonstrated. Some of these factors, such as RNAse E, act\nas depressors, whereas others, such as the alarmones ppGpp\nand cAMP, act as stimulators, demonstrating the role of nutri-\ntionalstressintheactivationoftheseretroelements(Coros etal.\n2008,2009;Nisa-Mart´ınez,Molina-S ´anchezandToro 2016).Thus,\ngroup II introns may act by preventing the damage caused by\n6 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6\nother MGEs activated by stress conditions. Although these find-\nings support that group II introns occasionally facilitate host\nadaptation, they are also in agreement with the reported self-\nish behavior of these retroelements that allows them to spread\nand survive within their bacterial host.\nRetrons\nIn 1984, an unusual single-stranded DNA, known as multicopy\nsingle-stranded DNA (msDNA) was found to accumulate to high\nlevelsinthebacterium Myxococcusxanthus (Yeeetal. 1984).Itwas\nsubsequently shown that msDNA was produced by an RT using\nat w o - r e g i o n(msr and msd) non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as a tem-\nplate, forming a unit called retron (Inouyeet al.1989; Lampson\netal. 1989; LimandMaas 1989).Thiswas thefirstdemonstration\nof RT activity in prokaryotic organisms (Inouye2017). Retrons\nhavebeenstudiedindetailbiochemically(Lampson,Inouyeand\nInouye 2005), but their biological role has remained unknown\nmore than 30 years after their discovery (Simon, Ellington and\nFinkelstein 2019). However, several independent studies have\nshed light on the function of retrons, proposing that they act\nas a novel prokaryotic defense system against phages (Gaoet al.\n2020; Millmanet al.2020). Interestingly, these studies show that\nthemsDNAmoleculeiscrucialfortheantiviralactivityofretron\nsystems(Gao etal. 2020;Millman etal. 2020;Bobonis etal. 2020a).\nDuringmsDNAsynthesis,theRTproteinisboundtothetran-\nscribed ncRNA just downstream from themsd region, where it\ninitiates a reverse transcription reaction using a 2\n′-OH group\npresent in a conserved branching G residue in themsr region as\na primer. The resulting msDNA remains covalently attached to\nthemsrRNAasasinglebranchedmoleculethrougha2 ′-5′ phos-\nphodiester bond (Shimamoto, Inouye and Inouye1995). Despite\nthe considerable divergence ofmsr/msd sequences in the small\nnumberofexperimentallyvalidatedretrons,allthesesequences\nhave a number of structural properties in common, including\ncomplementary 5\n′ and 3′ ends of the ncRNA, facilitating for-\nmation of the secondary structure of the RNA. Themsr region\npresents a variable number of short stem-loops and the msd\nregion folds into a single hairpin with a long stem, all of these\nfeatures being indispensable for msDNA production (Lampson,\nInouye and Inouye2005; Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019).\nThe recent expansion of the range and diversity of known\nretrons based on genome survey analyses has made it possible\nto increase the number of putative retrons from tens to thou-\nsands, with most of these elements containing in RT motif 7\nthe characteristic ‘VTG’ signature (Toroet al. 2019a). About a\nthird of annotated retrons were thought to encode an ancillary\ngene (Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019), but a computer\npipeline for the systematic prediction of genes specifically asso-\nciatedwithretronshasshownthatapproximately75%ofretrons\ninclude an additional component, as an independent gene or a\nRT-fused domain (Mestreet al.2020); retrons should, therefore,\nbeconsideredtripartitesystems(Fig. 2).Interestingly,thisreport\nshowed that the use of covariance models and consensus RNA\nstructure detection makes it possible to identify putative retron\nncRNA consensus structures, even in groups with no experi-\nmentally validated representatives. A comparison of the phylo-\ngeniesofthethreeretroncomponentsindicatesthatretronsare\nnot only highly modular, with the same type of RT associated\nwith different domains and vice versa, but that they have also\nco-evolved, suggesting that they may act as a functional unit.\nMoreover, based on the high diversity of putative enzymatic\nactivities encoded by the genes or associated domains, retrons\nhave been classified into 13 types and 25 subtypes, revealing\na tremendous diversity of possible mechanisms and biological\nfunctions not only related to defense (Mestreet al.2020).\nInterest in prokaryotic defense mechanisms against phages\nhas led to several strategies for searching for novel immu-\nnity systems. The most successful has involved searching for\nclusters of antiviral system genes in defense islands (Doron\net al.2018). This approach has led to some retron types being\nidentified as abundant in these islands, and two independent\nreports (Gao et al. 2020; Millman et al. 2020) have recently\nshown that some retron systems confer resistance to a wide\nrange of phages. In addition, mutations of the three com-\nponents of the system have been shown to abolish immu-\nnity, indicating that all three are required for correct activity.\nThe isolation of phages able to overcome the resistance con-\nferred by Retron-Eco6 (Ec48), a type IV retron system accord-\ning to the recent classification (Mestreet al. 2020), led to the\ndetection of genetic mutations inactivating a phage RecBCD\ninhibitor. This suggests that Retron-Eco6 acts as a RecBCD\nguardian, sensing the presence of phage-encoded RecBCD\ninhibitors and somehow activating the associated protein, in\nthis case, a two-transmembrane domain protein, resulting in\ncell death (Millman et al. 2020). However, Retron-Eco8, a type\nI-B2 retron system (Mestre et al. 2020), has been shown to\nact independently of RecBCD (Millman et al. 2020), highlight-\ning the diverse possible modes of action underlying the antivi-\nral activity of retrons, potentially due to highly diverse enzyme\nactivities.\nIn parallel, Retron-Sen2 (St85), a type I-B1 retron system\n(Mestre et al. 2020), has been shown to act as a novel type\nof tripartite toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, in which the RT and\nmsDNAformtheantitoxindirectlyblockingthetoxinunitcalled\nRcaT. This protein has been predicted to present a N-terminal\nnucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase-like (NDT) domain and a C-\nterminal DNA binding domain (Mestreet al.2020). Furthermore,\nthe toxicity of RcaT increases in cold temperatures or anaero-\nbic conditions (Elfenbein et al. 2015; Bobonis et al. 2020a)a n d\nits binding to the RT protein does not interfere with its tox-\nicity (Bobonis et al. 2020a). However, the presence of the RT-\nmsDNA complex binding the effector protein determines anti-\ntoxin specificity (Fig.3B). Phage-origin triggers and prophages-\nencoded blockers of this novel TA system have also been identi-\nfied,suggestinganextensivearms-racebetweenretronsystems\nand phages (Bobonisetal. 2020b). Some of the triggers identified\n(Dam and RecE) have been shown to directly interact with the\nRT-msDNA complex, methylating, cleaving and/or binding the\nmsDNA component and, therefore, triggering the activation of\nthe toxin. Moreover, Dam and RecE have anti-restriction proper-\nties and could lead to Abi mediated by RcaT through the inac-\ntivation of RT-msDNA antitoxins, suggesting crosstalk between\nthe innate/adaptive immunity systems and this tripartite TA\nsystem. One of the identified blockers is RacC, a small protein\nencoded by Rac-prophage which acts directly against the toxin\nactivity,raisingthepossibilityoftheexistenceofphage-encoded\nanti-retron systems.\nDespite the great progress in our understanding of retrons\nbased on these recent discoveries, many biological questions\nremain unanswered, concerning the ways in which different\ntypes ofretronsystems sensephages, howtheantitoxinisinac-\ntivated, or the role of the toxin in the final step in this form\nof immunity. Moreover, new types of retrons with new ncRNA\nstructures have recently been identified but have not yet been\nexperimentallycharacterized(Mestre etal. 2020).Furtherstudies\nare therefore required to improve our understanding of the bio-\nlogical role of retrons as an anti-phage system and of the other\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 7\nputative functions of these elements derived from their poten-\ntial for sensing other cell signals.\nDiversity-generating retroelements\nDGRs are a unique type of domesticated RT-containing system\nthat have evolved to provide benefits to the host through a\nreverse transcription reaction generating broad sequence vari-\nability in a specific target gene (Zimmerly and Wu2015). It has\nbeen suggested that they originated from a loss of movement\ncapacity in another type of retroelement followed by diversifi-\ncation, and they are widespread in phages, plasmids, bacterial\nand archaeal genomes (Paul et al. 2017;Y a net al. 2019; Roux\net al. 2020). The functional unit of DGRs is highly diverse and\nformed by a variable gene cassette, but all DGRs have at least\nthree essential components: a reverse transcriptase (RT), a tem-\nplate repeat (TR) and a target gene (TG) with a variable region\n(VR) displaying≈90% sequence identity to the TR (Fig.3C). DGRs\nincreasetheabilityofthehosttoadapttochangingenvironmen-\ntalconditionsthroughareactioncalledmutagenicretrohoming,\nduring which the TR RNA is randomly modified by a mutagenic\nreverse transcription process, and the resulting cDNA, typically\nwith random A-to-N mutations, is inserted into the VR region,\nreplacing the native sequence and creating multiple novel ver-\nsions of the TG (Medhekar and Miller2007;G u oet al.2014).\nSeveral DGRs have been characterized in bacterial genomes\n(Le Coq and Ghosh 2011; Arambula et al. 2013), but the best-\nknown and understood example of mutagenic retrohoming is\nthat of the DGR of theBordetella phage BPP-1 (Liu et al. 2002).\nDGR activity controls phage tropism switching, by generating\nnew variants of the major tropism determinant (Mtd) protein of\nthe tail. This protein is responsible for binding to pertactin, an\nadhesinonthecellsurfaceof Bordetellaspeciesthatisexpressed\nonly during the virulent Bvg\n+ phase. DGR hypermutation in Mtd\ntherefore facilitates the adaptation of phage tropism to surface\nmodifications in the host bacterium (Liuet al. 2002; Doulatov\net al.2004). The VR is found at the 3′ end of themtd gene, cor-\nresponding to a CLec (C-type lectin) fold consisting of a struc-\nturalscaffoldandafinalregioninwhichmassivemutationscan\noccur, resulting in functional protein variants (McMahonet al.\n2005). Furthermore, the mutagenic retrohoming performed by\ntheBPP-1phageDGRrequiresseveralancillaryelementsforeffi-\ncacy.Anaccessoryvariabilitydeterminant( avd)geneisinvolved\nin the mutagenic reverse transcription reaction, binding both\nthe RT protein and the RNA of the TR (Alayyoubiet al.2013). Fol-\nlowingcDNAsynthesis,recognitionbetweenTRandVRrequires\na GC-rich sequence called the initiation of mutagenic homing\n(IMH) sequence at the 3\n′ end of the VR, together with a slightly\ndifferent IMH sequence (IMH∗) in TR. A DNA stem-loop struc-\nture just downstream from the IMH sequence facilitates IMH-\nIMH∗ recognition, ensuring directional retrohoming and, there-\nfore, resulting in the correct insertion of a novel VR in the target\ngene (Guoet al.2011; Naoremet al.2017).\nOver the years, research has greatly expanded the num-\nber of putative DGRs identified, with the prediction of these\nretroelements in genomic (Parket al.2012; Schillinger and Zin-\ngler 2012; Nimkulrat et al. 2016;W u et al. 2018) and metage-\nnomicdata(Yan etal. 2019; Rouxetal. 2020).Furthermore, bioin-\nformatics tools have been developed to identify and character-\nize DGRs. These tools include DiGReF (Schillingeret al. 2012),\nDGRscan (Ye2014) and MyDGR (Sharifi and Ye2019). All these\nreports have progressively revealed the widespread presence of\nDGRs in prokaryotes and phages and have demonstrated the\ngreat variability of their genetic components and their func-\ntional diversity. Indeed, many bacterial DGRs have been shown\nto be encoded by temperate phages inserted into bacterial\nchromosomes as prophages (Benler et al. 2018). Based on RT\nsequences, the largest DGR dataset available compiles 32 321\nsequences,groupedinto1318clusters( ≥50%identity),including\nDGRs from phages and prokaryotic organisms, in both genomes\nand metagenomes (Rouxet al.2020). This survey revealed that\nDGRs predominate in continually changing environments, in\nwhich hypermutation is highly beneficial to the host. In these\necological conditions,continual attempts at thehorizontal gene\ntransfer of DGR cassettes are made between phylogenetically\ndistantorganisms,enhancingtheadaptationofabroadrangeof\nbiological entities. Furthermore, using non-synonymous single\nnucleotide variants (SNVs) has been shown that most DGRs (50-\n75%)analyzedpresentsignsofrecentactivity,withhigheractiv-\nity levels in phage-associated than in cellular DGRs, in which\nhypermutation may be induced under stress conditions (Roux\net al.2020).\nDGRs present a broad range of cassette architectures, based\non the order, number and orientation of their components\n(Fig. 2). For example, there are four classes of accessory genes,\nwith avd the most common (over 70%), but some DGR loci lack\nthis ancillary ORF. Furthermore, DGRs can present multiple tar-\nget genes (from 2 to 8) and can act intrans (Wu et al. 2018).\nDespite this modular organization, the target genes typically\nencode multidomain proteins with the VR located at the C-\nterminus. These regions are associated only with the C-type\nlectin fold and with an uncharacterized domain next to Ig-like\nfoldproteinsequences(Roux etal. 2020).Inaddition,VRssharea\nhighly conserved sequence on either side of the fold sequence,\nwhereas the internal sequence is subject to mutagenesis (Wu\net al. 2018). The crystal structure of the C-type lectin fold has\nrevealed an unusually large capacity to accommodate massive\nsequence variation (Handaet al.2016). This and the conserved\nbias towards adenine mutation indicate that DGRs are mecha-\nnistically limited in terms of how and where they can produce\ndiversity (Wuet al.2018; Roux et al.2020\n). However, the target\nproteins have also been shown to be highly modular, suggesting\nthat genetic recombination occurs between independent fold-\ning domains and a C-terminal C-type lectin fold to generate\nchimeric targets (Rouxet al.2020). This process may be the evo-\nlutionary source of the involvement of DGRs in various func-\ntions beneficial for the host. Target genes are currently classi-\nfied on the basis of the putative functions of the domains out-\nside the VR sequence, mostly involved in protein–protein bind-\ning, ligand binding or surface displays activities, suggesting a\nbroad range of potential biological functions, including viru-\nlence, virus-host or cell-cell interactions (Fig.3C). Most phage\ntarget genes encode structural proteins, the variability of which\nenables phages to overcome bacterial defenses based on cell\nwall modifications, whereas cellular target genes encode pro-\nteins involved in binding extracellular substrates (Rouxet al.\n2020). A new target function has recently been described, with\na group of specific cyanobacterial DGRs able to hypermutate\na small pocket in binding domains of multidomain proteins\nbroadly involved in regulatory pathways (Vallota-Eastmanet al.\n2020). Given the broad array of possible scenarios, further char-\nacterization of novel types of DGRs is required to develop a full\nunderstanding of the role of these elements in their biological\nniches.\nRTs associated with CRISPR–Cas systems\nCRISPR–Cas (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) systems are an adap-\ntive immune system harbored by archaea and bacteria for\n8 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6\ndefense against foreign nucleic acids, mostly MGEs, such as\nphages, transposons and plasmids (Barrangou et al. 2007).\nCRISPR-mediated immunity occurs in three stages: adaptation,\nexpression and interference (Van der Oost et al. 2014). How-\never, the mechanism of the immune response is highly variable,\nthanks to the considerable diversity of CRISPRs, comprising two\nclasses, six types and 33 subtypes (Makarovaet al. 2020). The\nrelationship between RTs and these very diverse defense sys-\ntems was described for the first time in 2008 (Kojima and Kane-\nhisa 2008; Simon and Zimmerly2008).\nBoth these studies showed that the reverse transcriptase-\ncoding region was adjacent or fused to thecas1 gene, which\nis present in most CRISPR–Cas systems. This observation was\nendorsedbybroaderstudiesofRTslinkedtothesesystems(Toro\nand Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014; Toro, Mart´ınez-Abarca and Gonz´alez-\nDelgado2017).Simultaneously,itwasshownthatCas1andCas2\nformanintegrasecomplexresponsibleforperformingtheadap-\ntive step of CRISPR-Cas immunity, which involves the insertion\nof a genetic fragment of the invading agent, known as the pro-\ntospacer, into the CRISPR array as a new spacer between two\nrepeatsequences,thedirectrepeats(DRs;Yosef,GorenandQim-\nron 2012;N u˜nez et al. 2014;J a c k s o net al. 2017). This particular\ngroup of RTs may, therefore, be involved in acquiring new spac-\ners from RNA sources.\nThishypothesiswasrecentlyvalidatedbythreeindependent\nstudies in different systems: the Cas6RTCas1 adaptive operon\nfromMarinomasmediterranea MMB-1(Silas etal. 2016),theRTCas1\nsystem fromFusicanibacter saccharivorans(Schmidt, Cherepkova\nand Platt 2018) and the RTCas1 system from Vibrio vulnificus\nYJ016 (Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019). All three studies showed\nthat RT-CRISPR systems can acquire new spacers directly from\nRNA in vivo,in an RT-dependent manner, via a mechanism with\nfeatures common to group II intron retrohoming (Fig.3D). It has\nalso been demonstrated that the additional Cas6 domain in the\nM. mediterraneasystem participates in CRISPR–RNA (crRNA) bio-\ngenesis and is required for RT activity and its regulation (Mohr\net al.2018). This crosstalk between the different components of\nRT–CRISPR systems has been validated by the cryo-EM structure\nof a Cas6RTCas1–Cas2 complex fromThiomicrospira(Wanget al.\n2021), in which the linking RT helix regulates both RT and Cas1\nactivities.\nIn the conditions analyzed, the spacers acquired by the RT-\ncontaining adaptive operon in these systems were found to\nbe biased towards highly transcribed regions (Silaset al.2016;\nSchmidt, Cherepkova and Platt2018) or highly abundant rRNAs\n(Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019), reflecting a correlation between\nspacer acquisition events and RNA abundance. The systems\nstudied displayed a bias towards the antisense strand of coding\nsequences in the newly acquired spacers of the CRISPR Array\nwhen the adaptive unit was present alone. Most RTs are asso-\nciated with type III CRISPR-Cas systems (Silaset al.2017;T o r o ,\nMart´ınez-Abarca and Gonz´alez-Delgado 2017; Toroet al.2019a),\nwhich recognize both DNA and RNA targets for target degra-\ndation. This slight preference for the antisense strand during\nacquisition therefore improves the performance of the interfer-\nence step of type III systems, thanks to the complementarity\nbetween the crRNA and the target transcript (Pyenson and Mar-\nraffini 2017). However, the natural sources of the spacers found\nin CRISPR Arrays associated with RT-containing CRISPR–Cas loci\nremaintobedetermined.Duetothelimitedabundanceanddis-\ntribution of RNA phages, only one natural example of CRISPR\nimmunity to an RNA phage has been described (Wolfetal. 2020),\nandonlyafewmatchestoDNAphage-likesequenceshavebeen\nfound (Silaset al.2017). Different approaches, such as exploring\nthe larger number of metagenomes available from databases, as\nwell and the recent expansion of known ssRNA phage genomes\nfrom tens to 15 611 near-complete genomes (Callanan et al.\n2020), might help to shed light on this topic and improve our\nunderstanding of the biological role of RT–CRISPR–Cas systems\nin their environmental niche.\nThe origin and evolutionary relationships of RTs function-\nally associated with CRISPR-Cas systems have been a matter\nof debate since the proposal of two models, one suggesting\na ‘single-point origin’, in which RTs are domesticated by the\nCRISPR–Cas locus via the retrotransposition of a group II intron\n(Silas et al. 2017), and the other postulating ‘multiple origins’,\nin which RTs related to group II introns have been recruited\nby CRISPR–Cas adaptation modules several times during evo-\nlution (Toro et al. 2018). However, new insight into the ‘mul-\ntiple origins’ model was provided by a recent analysis of the\nputative RT sequences in bacterial genomes (Toroet al.2019a).\nThis study identified a total of 15 clades of CRISPR-RTs: 13\nclades closely related to group II introns already reported in\nthe previous analysis (Toro et al. 2018), and two new clades,\none evolved from retron/retron-like sequences (clade 14) and\nthe other from RTs related to the RT domain present in Abi-P2\nsystems (clade 15). Furthermore, novel RT sequences adjacent\nor fused to an Archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP) domain and\nbelongingtoclade12havebeendescribed(Fig. 2),suggestingthe\npossibility of cDNA production without the use of a primer to\nfacilitate the acquisition of spacers in these particular systems.\nAlltheRTsdescribedinthesestudieswerefoundtobefunction-\nally linked to type III CRISPR–Cas systems, with the exception\nof those AbiP2-like RTs linked to a type I-C system, but a recent\nstudyreportedtherecruitmentofRTCas1fusionproteinsbytype\nVI-A CRISPR–Cas systems (Toroetal. 2019b).

In\nthisway,Abisystemspreventphagemultiplication,therebypro-\ntecting the rest of the population (Bernheim and Sorek2020).\nA tremendous variety of Abi genes has been described, with\nabout 20 different Abi systems present inLactococcus spp. alone.\nAnother indicator of the heterogeneity of Abi systems is that\nthree such systems contain an RT domain: AbiA, AbiK and\nAbi-P2 (Fortier, Bouchard and Moineau2005; Odegrip, Nilsson\nandHagg ˚ard-Ljungquist2006;DurmazandKlaenhammer 2007).\nHowever, the role of the putative reverse transcriptase activity\nin these systems remains unclear. Only in the case of AbiK has\nbeen shown that the RT domainper se is sufficient to confer\nphageresistance(Fortier,BouchardandMoineau 2005).ForAbiA\nand Abi-P2, it remains unclear whether other genetic elements\npresent at the same locus are required for defense activity.\nEach of these systems has a different mode of operation, but\nthe N-terminal RT domains of Abi proteins have several fea-\ntures in common, including the conservation of a potentially\nactive site with a Y(R/V)DD sequence and the absence of the\nRT motif 7 (Simon and Zimmerly2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 9\n2014). A C-terminal domain of variable length and uncharacter-\nized function fused to this domain is also present in all types\nof RT-based Abi systems (Fig. 2). It has been suggested that\nthe AbiA C-terminal domain is a novel version of the higher\neukaryote and prokaryote nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain\n(Anantharaman et al.2013). In many defense systems, includ-\ning restriction-modification (R-M), toxin-antitoxin (TA), CRISPR–\nCas and other Abi systems, HEPN domains play a key role due\ntheir RNAse activity, which may directly attack viral RNAs or\ninduce host suicide or dormancy by attacking self-RNAs. The\npresence of RT and HEPN domains in AbiA suggests that phage\nmultiplication may be inhibited through interaction between\nphage-encoded proteins and a DNA molecule covalently linked\nto the RT, with the HEPN domain degrading host RNA, driving\nthe cell to suicide and protecting the surrounding community\n(Fig. 3E). Indeed, the best-characterized AbiA protein, which is\nfound in a lactococcal plasmid (Hill, Pierce and Klaenhammer\n1989), is able to stop phage replication. Furthermore, a mutant\nin a phage recombinase have been shown to be insensitive to\nAbiA-mediated immunity (Dinsmore and Klaenhammer1997),\nsuggesting that this recombinase could trigger AbiA. Loci con-\ntainingAbiAsequenceshavebeenshowntoconferimmunityto\na wide set of lactococcal phages (Hill, Miller and Klaenhammer\n1990; Tangney and Fitzgerald2002a). The lactococcal AbiA also\ndisplays versatile heterologous activity, conferring resistance to\nseveralphagesina Streptococcusthermophilus strain(Tangneyand\nFitzgerald 2002b).\nThebest-knownRT-basedAbisystemisAbiK,whichhasalso\nbeen found in a plasmid native to a lactococcal strain (Emond\net al.1997). In addition to AbiA, this system provides resistance\nto a broad range of lactococcal phages (936, c2 and P335), reduc-\ning infectivity by six orders of magnitude (Fortier, Bouchard and\nMoineau 2005). The AbiK protein has a DNA polymerase activ-\nity divergent from that of canonical RTs and acts like a termi-\nnal transferase, polymerizing DNAs of random sequence (Wang\net al. 2011). Moreover, the synthesized product remains cova-\nlently attached to the enzyme, possibly via a hydroxide group\non a tyrosine located in the C-terminal domain, which could\nact as the primer for a reaction that would be similar to that\nobserved in hepadnavirus self-priming (Wang and Seeger1992).\nConversely, studies of phage mutants able to escape AbiK have\nidentified different viral proteins sensitive to AbiK-mediated\nimmunity. All these proteins, denoted Sak (sensitivity to AbiK),\nparticipate in the phage replication process (Ploquinet al.2008;\nLopes et al.2010;S c a l t r i t iet al.2010;S c a l t r i t iet al.2011). In this\nway,theAbiKsystemworkslikeAbiA,preventingphagematura-\ntionbyafunctional interactionwithSakproteinsandprovoking\ncell death by an unknown mechanism (Fig.3E).\nUnlike the previously described systems, Abi-P2 is encoded\nin a highly variable region of several P2 prophages present in\ndifferent E. colistrains, with a higher AT content than the host\ngenome, suggesting that this region may have been acquired by\nHGT (Odegrip, Nilsson and Hagg˚ard-Ljungquist 2006). Further-\nmore, Abi-P2 displays reverse transcriptase activity and confers\nresistance to the T5 phage by decreasing the plating efficiency\nof this phage by more than seven orders of magnitude (Fig.3E).\nMoreover, deletion of the region of the gene containing the\nsequence encoding the putative active site of Abi-P2 (YRDD)\nabolishes resistance to the phage. A recent genome survey\nanalysis enlarged the number of known RT-based Abi systems\nby an order of magnitude, with Abi-P2 accounting for 75% of\nthese systems (Toro et al. 2019a). Non-redundant homologs\nof AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2 have been found in many bacterial\nphyla and are particularly diverse in the phylum Firmicutes. By\ncontrast, no RT-containing Abi systems has ever been found in\nArchaea. With the increasing number of examples identified,\nresearch in this field merits a new impetus, to shed light on the\nrole of these Abi-like RTs in phage resistance.\nRTs from unknown groups (UG)\nOvertheyears,noveluncharacterizedRTsmoredistantlyrelated\nto group II intron RTs and clustering in the so-called ‘unknown\ngroups’ have emerged in analyses of increasing numbers of RT\nsequences (Kojima and Kanehisa 2008; Simon and Zimmerly\n2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014). There are now 28 differ-\nent UGs covering 10% of prokaryotic RT diversity (Toroet al.\n2019a) showing considerable sequence diversity. For example,\nUG1 and UG5 RTs have a C-terminal nitrilase domain (Simon\nandZimmerly 2008),whereas,inUG6,thisdomainislocatedfur-\nther downstream in an adjacent ORF (Gaoet al.2020). UG3 and\nUG8 represent a unique case in which RT sequences are always\nlocated next to each other, suggesting that they act as a func-\ntional unit (Fig.2; Kojima and Kanehisa2008).\nRTs from UG groups have recently been found in defense\nislands and have been experimentally validated as new anti-\nphage systems known as Defense-associated RTs (DRTs), in\nwhichimmunityisdependentontheRTdomain(Gao etal. 2020).\nIn DRT type 1 (UG1) both the C-terminal nitrilase domain and\na small membrane protein are required for defense (Fig.3F). In\nDRT type 3, corresponding to UG3 and UG8, a structured ncRNA\ndownstream from the UG8 gene is required for immunity. By\ncontrast, in DRT type 2 (UG2), type 4 (UG15) and type 5 (UG16),\nthe RT alone is sufficient for resistance against phages. How-\never, the mechanism of action of these novel systems remains\nundeciphered, and additional experimental data are required\nto determine how UG-RTs provide protection against different\ntypes of phages. Moreover, not all UG groups have been tested,\nand only some of those investigated display antiviral properties\n(Gao et al.2020). The characterization of additional types of UG-\nRTs is therefore required, for the discovery of new DRT systems.\nGroup II-like (G2L) uncharacterized RTs\nIn addition to the RT lineages described above, novel phyloge-\nnetic groups may arise through different types of domestica-\ntion of ancient retroelements, the function of which remains to\nbe elucidated. The RTs of one of these groups are most closely\nrelated phylogenetically to group II introns and were therefore\nnamed ‘group II-like’ or ‘G2L’ RTs. The main difference between\nthe RTs of this group and those classified as group II introns\nis the absence of the characteristic intronic RNA structure in\nthe G2L group (Simon and Zimmerly2008). A previous analy-\nsis of the prokaryotic reverse transcriptase landscape (Toroetal.\n2019a) led to an increase in the number of identified G2L-type\nsequences,withthesesequencesbeingfoundtobranchofffrom\na node common to CRISPR-associated RTs. There is a close rela-\ntionship between G2L and CRISPR-RTs, and it should be pointed\nout that two groups previously classified as G2L (G2L1 and G2L2)\nhave since been reclassified as new clades of RT-CRISPR sys-\ntems (clade4/6 and clade 9), suggesting that both RT lineages\nmay have evolved from a common ancestral group II intron\nRT. Moreover, the previously named G2L3 (Simon and Zimmerly\n2008)wasnoticedtobephylogeneticallyseparatedfromtheG2L\nlineage (Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014) and more recently, this\nmonophyletic group has been reclassified as a novel UG group\nnamed as UG17 (Toroet al. 2019a). The G2L lineage has been\ngreatly expanded and comprises RT sequences clustered within\nthe G2L4 and G2L5 groups (Simon and Zimmerly2008) and four\nadditional clades (Toroet al.2019a).\n10 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6\nFigure 4. Discovery of putative functional associations of G2L-RTs. Representative instances of RTs from G2L group found in defense islands. Some of these RTs\nare embedded in a multicomponent system (colored in purple), comprised by QueC, QueD, QueE (queuosine biosynthesis pathway), FGE-s (FGE sulfatase), YaaA\n(DNA-binding protein), GTF (Glycosyltransferase), RSE (Radical Sam Enzyme), PRT (phosphoribosyltransferase), Nuclease (Flap Endonuclease), PIG-L (GlcNAc-PI de-N-\nacetylase)andGTP-c(GTPcyclohydrolase).Genesknowntobeinvolvedindefenseareshowninyellow:CRISPR–CassystemtypeI-B,TypeIRM(Restricto n-Modification),\nTA (Toxin-Antitoxin), Wadjet, Septu and Gabija are recently described defense systems (Doronet al.2018). The genes encoded by a conjugative transposon are shown\nin dark grey. The encoding strain, the accession number and the genomic coordinates and the protein ID on NCBI or PATRIC databases are indicated to the left.\nIn this way, G2L may constitute an evolutionary record of\nan intermediate state between the autonomous mobilization\nof group II intron RTs and the domestication of these RTs for\nthe performance of useful cellular functions. This hypothesis\nwastestedbyanalyzingthegenomicneighborhood(Mestre etal.\n2020)ofG2Lsequences,tosearchforpossibleevidenceofemerg-\ningfunctionalassociations(seeSupplementaryMethods).Inter-\nestingly, a particular subgroup of G2L RTs (cluster 4; Toroet al.\n2019a) appears to be embedded in a multicomponent system\ncomposed of the products of thequeACDEgenes involved in the\nqueuosine biosynthesis pathway (Thiavilleet al.2016), two dif-\nferent glycosyltransferases, the 5\n′-3′ exonuclease domain of a\nfamily A DNA polymerase, a GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase (LmbE),\na phosphoribosyltransferase, YaaA (DUF328), which is a DNA-\nbinding protein with a novel fold (Prahladet al. 2020), and a\nFGE sulfatase with a C-lec fold (Fig.4 and Figure S1, Supporting\nInformation). QueC was recently reported to be a component of\nnovel defense systems (Gaoet al.2020), which suggest that this\ngenomic cassette may also be involved in immunity functions.\nMoreover, 25% of known G2L-RT sequences were located close\nto known defense system sequences (Fig.4). Thus, functional\nassociations between G2L and neighboring genes could gener-\nate specialized systems with antiviral activities worthy of fur-\nther investigation.\nDifferential distribution of RTs in bacteria and archaea\nThemostexhaustivephylogeneticanalysisofbacterialRTsused\n198 760 predicted RT proteins and addressed the distribution of\nRTs,mostlyinbacteria(Toro etal. 2019a).Theclassificationofthe\nfinal dataset of 9141 non-redundant RTs supported the classifi-\ncation of most RTs into the three main groups: group-II introns,\nthe largest group, accounting for 47% of RTs, retron/retron-like\nsequences (25%) and DGRs (12%; Fig.5A and B). The remain-\ning 16% of RTs clustered into distinct groups including RTs pre-\nviously reported to be linked to CRISPR–Cas systems, group 2-\nlike (G2L), Abi-like or UG (unknown) groups. These data are con-\nsistent with previously reported findings (Kojima and Kanehisa\n2008; Simon and Zimmerly2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014).\nFar fewer RT sequences have been identified in archaea\nthan in bacteria, because of the smaller number of com-\nplete genome sequences available in databases (i.e. more than\n3 × 10\n5 bacterial genome sequences versus just under 5 ×\n103 archaeal genome sequences in the PATRIC database; Sup-\nplementary Methods). A more detailed analysis of archaeal\nRTs revealed that DGRs accounted for the largest proportion\n(30% of total archaeal RTs), contrasting with the situation in\nbacteria (with only 12%). The opposite pattern was observed\nfor retrons, which account for only 4% of total archaeal RTs\n(Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary File 1). No RTs from the G2L\nor Abi-like groups have been found in archaea. The remain-\ning RT groups account for similar proportions of the RTs in\narchaea and bacteria, with group II introns the most abun-\ndant (52%), which are probably proliferating in archaea even\nthough they were originally acquired from bacteria (Fig. 5B;\nToro2003).\nIn bacteria, the Flavobacteria–Chlorobi–Bacteroidetes group\n(FCB), candidate phyla radiation (CPR) and Cyanobacteria have\nhigh rates of non-redundant RTs relative to the number of\nsequenced genomes for these phyla (Figure S2A, Supporting\nInformation). Group II introns are, predictably, prevalent in\nmost bacterial phyla, but retrons predominate in Proteobacte-\nria, whereas DGRs account for about 80% of total RTs in CPR, the\nstrongest bias towards a specific RT group in bacteria (Fig.5D).\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 11\nFigure 5.DistributionofprokaryoticRTs.

In panels (B, D and E), the number of unique RT\nsequences is indicated after the name of each domain/phylum.\nLooked at the other way (distribution of bacterial phyla for par-\nticular RT groups), Proteobacteria is the predominant phylum in\nmost RT lineages, whereas, Firmicutes account for a large pro-\nportion of group II introns and Abi-like RTs. Similarly, the CPR\ngroup contains about 40% of all singular DGRs (Figure S2B, Sup-\nporting Information). These data support the notion that some\nbacterial phyla have recruited specific groups of RTs to improve\ntheirresponsestotheecologicalconditionsintheirnaturalenvi-\nronments.\nAs in bacteria, in most phyla and other taxonomic groups\nof archaea there is a correlation between the total number\nof genomes sequenced and the total number of RTs found in\nthe group concerned, except for the TACK group (the Thau-\nmarchaeota, Aigararchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota\nphyla), which accounts for 25% of total archaeal genomes but\nonly7%ofnon-redundantRTsequences(FigureS2C,Supporting\nInformation). Group II introns predominate in Euryarchaeota,\nthe TACK group and the Asgard group (55–75% of RTs). How-\never, a different scenario emerges for the DPANN group (Dia-\npherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota\nand Nanohaloarchaeota) and uncultured/unclassified archaea,\nin which DGRs account for about 80% of RTs (Fig.5E). Regard-\ning the dominance of phyla for every RT group, it is worth to\nhighlight that 90% of all DGRs were found in DPANN group and\nunclassified archaea (Figure S2D, Supporting Information).\nThe abundance of DGRs in the DPANN group and in the bac-\nterial CPR group has been described (Paulet al.2017; Rouxet al.\n2020),butweshowherethatDGRsare,byfar,themostabundant\n12 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6\ntype of RT in these phylogenetic groups. Curiously, the DPANN\ngroup is the most divergent of all archaeal groups, resembling\nthe situation of the CPR group in bacteria (Castelleet al.2018).\nIndeed, these groups have several characteristics in common\nanddifferfromotherprokaryoticorganismsinhavingsmallcell\nandgenomesizes,intheirepisymbioticrelationshipswithother\norganisms and their limited metabolic capacities. In this con-\ntext, the high abundance of DGRs in the DPANN and CPR groups\nmay reflect a role of RTs of this type in the adaptation of these\norganisms to their biological niches through changes in mem-\nbrane proteins facilitating interactions with the host (Castelle\net al.2018).\nBiotechnological applications of prokaryotic RTs\nRTs, particularly those from eukaryotes and viruses, have\nbeen exploited as biotechnological tools in a wide range\nof fields (Mart´ın-Alonso, Frutos-Beltr´an and Men ´endez-Arias\n2020). The unique properties of several prokaryotic RTs groups\nhave enabled their use in a wide variety of genome editing\napplications, including gene targeting, high-throughput site-\ndirected mutagenesis technologies, libraries of highly mutage-\nnized genes or with high-throughput transcriptional character-\nization purposes (Table1).\nFor gene targeting the specific interactions between intron\nand exon-binding sites (IBS–EBS) required for group II intron\nretromobility was harnessed to target introns to prepro-\ngrammed positions (Guo et al. 2000; Mohr et al. 2000;K a r b e r g\net al.2001; Enyeartet al.2014). Thus, group II introns have been\nexploited as the first RNA-guided gene targeting tools in a wide\nvariety of bacterial genomes in the so-called targetron knock-\nout technology (Table1). With an algorithm designed to iden-\ntify optimal matches, targetrons are programmed to insert into\ndesiredgenesbymodifyingthesequenceelementsintheintron\nRNA to base-pair to the IBS in the DNA target site (Zhuanget al.\n2009;G a r c´ıa-Rodr´ıguez et al. 2014;G w e eet al. 2019;W e net al.\n2020).ThecouplingofthistechniquewithCRISPR-Cas9counter-\nselection has recently increased the chances of finding clones\nin which the intron is integrated into the target sequence in\na recombination-independent fashion (Vel´azquez, Lorenzo and\nAl-Ramahi 2019). Group II introns have also been programmed\nto deliverlox sites which are used by Cre recombinase to gener-\nate insertions, inversions, deletions and one-step cut-and-paste\noperations (Table1; Enyeartet al.2013). On the other hand, the\nability of retrons to produce msDNA at high copy number has\nallowed the use of these elements with gene silencing purposes\n(Table1;M a oet al.1995; Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019).\nThis approach is based on the fact that themsd region can be\nmodified with a random sequence without disturbing the pro-\nduction of msDNA. Thus, retrons could be engineered to syn-\nthesize specific DNA molecules that works as antisense cDNAs\nto knockdown the mRNA levels of a target gene (Maoetal. 1995).\nThe particularities of retrons have also been used as an\ninteresting alternative in high-throughput directed mutagene-\nsisapplications(Simon,EllingtonandFinkelstein 2019).Thefirst\napproach, referred to as Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrat-\ning Biological Events (SCRIBE), was based on engineered vari-\nants of Retron-Eco1 with a modifiedmsdregion (Table1;F a r z a d -\nfard and Lu 2014). The production of the modified msDNA,\nwhich is inducible by arbitrary transcriptional signals (light and\nchemical inducers), acts as a genomic ‘tape recorder’ of the\npresence of these signals at population level. To increase effi-\nciency, the retron unit is co-expressed in combination with the\nBeta recombinase of bacteriophageλ, leading to the recombi-\nnation of the modified msDNA into a specific DNAlocus in a\nmagnitude-andduration-dependentwayofthesignals(Farzad-\nfard and Lu2014). However, due to the moderate recombination\nlevel (∼10\n−4 recombination events per generation) observed in\nthis system, several works have studied the factors that lim-\nits retron recombineering (Simon, Morrow and Ellington2018;\nFarzadfard et al. 2020; Schubert et al. 2020). The first improve-\nments in efficiency were carried out by optimizing the promoter\nand by knocking out genes that reduces the accumulation of\nmsDNA, specifically the mismatch repair protein MutS and the\nsingle-stranded exonuclease ExoX (Simon, Morrow and Elling-\nton 2018). This system yields recombination efficiencies 2 order\nof magnitude higher and allows continuous evolution of target\nloci by expressing the retron unit under the control of an error-\nprone RNA polymerase, which generates random mutations in\nthe msd region that are introduced into the target DNA (Simon,\nMorrowandEllington 2018).Furthermore,thedeletionorsilenc-\ning of other host factors, mainly exonucleases such asrecJ and\nsbcB(xonA),significantlyincreasedtherecombinationfrequency\nachieving>99% editing efficiency (Table1; Farzadfardetal. 2020;\nSchubertetal. 2021). Both works circumvent some limitations of\nprevious genome-editing technologies in bacteria, including the\nneed to electroporate with mutagenic oligonucleotides or the\nrequirementsofspecificcis-encodedelements(i.e.PAMmotifin\nCRISPR–Cas9counterselection).Thus,Farzadfardandcolleagues\n(2020) introduce HiSCRIBE (High-efficency SCRIBE) and demon-\nstrate their use in recording transient spatial information and\ncontinuous genome evolution. On the other hand, Schubert and\ncollaborators (2021) create RLR (Retron Recombination Library)\nuseful to prepare pooled, barcoded mutant libraries for high-\nthroughput screens of allelic variants and uniquely suit to uti-\nlize non-designed sources of variation. Interestingly, a recent\nwork has also shown that modifications in the ncRNA structure\nand in the architecture of the retron operon lead to a more effi-\ncient reverse transcription reaction and, thus, in a higher retron\nrecombineering efficiency in bacteria, yeast and human cells\n(L´opez et al. 2021). Moreover, retron recombineering technolo-\ngies have also been used in combination with CRISPR–Cas sys-\ntems for multiplex gene editing in bacteria (Limet al.2020)a n d\neukaryotes (Sharonet al.2018). This last study uses a chimeric\nRNA comprised by a modified retron ncRNA joined to a CRISPR\nguide in a technology called Cas9 Retron precISE Parallel Edit-\ning via homologY (CRISPEY) ideal to identify causal variants for\npolygenic traits (Table1).\nContinuous target evolution could also be performed using\nDGRs, thanks to their ability to generate multiple variants of a\nprotein domain, which can be useful in biotechnological appli-\ncations such as in phage therapy. However, only one prelimi-\nnarystudyhasbeenabletodemonstratetheabilityofthephage\nBPP-1 DGR to create variants of tropism proteins likely to bind\nthe T4 lysozyme (Table1; Yuanet al.2013). The exploration of\nnovel DGRs with advantageous properties, such as thermosta-\nbility (Handa, Shaw and Ghosh 2019), could provide promis-\ning new tools. In addition, characterization of the mutagenic\nretrohoming mechanism has revealed that the RT and Avd pro-\nteins of the BPP-1 DGR work as a complex and that both are\nrequired for cDNA synthesis from both DGR and non-DGR tem-\nplates with an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) primer (Handaet al.\n2018).cDNAssynthesizedfromnon-DGRtemplatesalsopresent\nadeninemutations,revealingthistobeanintrinsicfeatureofthe\nRT–Avd complex.

The features of spe-\ncific Group II intron-RTs, such as some thermostable group II\nintron RTs (TGIRTs; Mohret al.2013) and other fromEubacterium\nrectale (Marathon RT; Zhao and Pyle 2018), which present ultra-\nprocessive and accurate properties, have been used in RNA-\nseq and epitranscriptomics technologies. Interestingly, the RT-\ncontaining CRISPR loci have also been used with similar appli-\ncations to record transcriptional events (Schmidt, Cherepkova\nand Platt 2018), also expanding the CRISPR–Cas toolbox (Jinek\net al.2012; Komor, Badran and Liu2017; Pickar-Oliver and Gers-\nbach 2019; Vigouroux and Bikard2020). The adaptive operon of\nF. saccharivorans, a complex formed by the RTCas1 fusion pro-\ntein and Cas2, has been used to develop Record-seq technology,\nwhich records transcriptional events in a CRISPR array as DNA,\ndescribing specific and complex cellular behaviors and assess-\ning cumulative gene expression (Table1; Schmidt, Cherepkova\nand Platt2018; Tannaet al.2020). However, the use of theF. sac-\ncharivoranssystem as an RNA-recording tool presents the disad-\nvantageofapparentskewingtowardsAT-richregionsattheends\nof transcripts.

Moreover, these systems could be used\nas highly scalable bacterial biosensors to report on gut function\n(Tanna, Ramachanderan and Platt2021). In addition, the char-\nacterization of singular RTs linked to CRISPR-Cas systems could\nprovide useful tools, such as groups of RTs fused to a putative\nprimase (AEP) domain that might not require priming for cDNA\nreactions.\nOn the other hand, the recent finding that some retrons sys-\ntems can constitute novel tripartite TA systems (Gaoet al.2020;\nMestre et al. 2020; Millman et al. 2020; Bobonis et al. 2020a, b)\ncontaining an effector associated protein endowed with anti-\nphage activity could also lead to new biotechnological applica-\ntions. For example, retrons could be engineered for their use in\nphage therapy or as riboswitches, applying certain conditions\nthat trigger the desired response. Thus, the potential of these\nelements as biotechnological tools is only just beginning to be\nunderstood. Furthermore, the large RT proteins involved in Abi\nsystems could also provide novel biotechnological tools, thanks\nto the enzymatic diversity provided by the domains fused to the\nC-terminus of the RT domain. These natural fusions are worth\ncharacterizing, particularly for AbiA, in which polymerase and\nputative RNAse activities are combined in a single protein that\nmay function differently from the RTs of retroviruses. Similarly,\nthe properties of other RTs from other groups, such as the UG\nandG2Lgroups,someofwhichareinvolvedinantiviraldefenses\n(Gao et al.2020), and those found in Archaea could supply novel\nfunctions for use in the existing or new fields. We are currently\nwitnessing the first uses of prokaryotic RTs in a broad range of\nbiotechnology applications.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis review describes how prokaryotic organisms have domes-\nticated the different types of RTs to perform defense functions\nagainst phages and other MGEs. The outstanding research per-\nformed in the last few years has not only resolved the 30-year-\nold enigma of the biological role of retrons (Gaoet al.2020; Mill-\nman et al.2020; Bobonis et al.2020a, b), but also revealed why\nthepresenceofanRTisadvantageousforsometypesofCRISPR–\nCas systems (Silaset al.2016; Toroet al.2019b), and has shown\nthat some uncharacterized groups of RTs confer resistance to\na wide range of phages (Gaoet al.2020). However, several key\nquestions remain unanswered. From an evolutionary point of\nview, it would be worthwhile improving our understanding of\nhow group II introns evolved in their host genome and gave rise\nto other types of prokaryotic RTs. Interestingly, defense systems\nand MGEs have several characteristics in common, including\nbeing the only two functional categories of genes with a neg-\native selection coefficient (Iranzoet al.2017), implying that they\ncanbedeleterioustothehost.Theseparallelevolutionaryhisto-\nriescouldprovidethenecessarysubstrateformobilegeneticele-\nments and defense systems to become associated on multiple\noccasions throughout evolution, as demonstrated for CRISPR–\nCassystems(KooninandMakarova 2019).Itwouldbereasonable\nto hypothesize that group II introns may have been the source\nofotherdomesticatedRTsforvariousdefensesystems.Research\non RTs phylogenetically related to group II introns, such as the\nG2L lineage, could shed light on this issue.\nWith our current knowledge of RTs, we are only just begin-\nning to understand the impact of these enzymes in prokary-\notes.ExploringnewgroupsofrecentlyexpandedgroupIIintrons\n(Toroet al.2019a) may shed light on how these selfish elements\nachieve a balance between their inherent need to spread and\ntheirabilitytocontrolMGEs,resultinginbenefittothehost.The\nrecentlydiscoveredanti-phageactivityofretronshasopenedup\na whole new avenue of research, extending from clarification of\nthe stages of retron-mediated immunity to the way in which\nphages overcome this defensive barrier. Given the modularity\nand diversity of retron systems (Mestreet al. 2020), a number\nof completely different biological mechanisms may be involved.\nA parallel track could be followed for UGs, in which computa-\ntional analysis may also reveal the existence of more diversity,\npotentiallyassociatedwithotherproteinsorncRNAsandconsti-\ntutingnovelDRTs.Interestingly,phylogeneticanalysis(Toroand\nNisa-Mart´ınez2014;Toro etal. 2019a)hasshownthattheAbi-RTs\nlie among UG-RTs, suggesting that DRTs may confer resistance\nsimilarlytoAbi-RTs,leadingthehostcelltocommitsuicide.The\npresence of an RT domain provides an adaptive advantage to\nRNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas systems (types III and VI; Silaset al.\n2016; Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019), but the origin of the spac-\ners in the CRISPR arrays of systems carrying RTs and the struc-\ntural basis of the mechanism of RNA spacer integration into the\narray remain a mystery. Further studies are therefore required\nto improve our understanding of type III and VI CRISPR biology.\nFinally, in addition to their known functions, the other possible\nroles of DGRs should be studied, to shed light on the ways in\nwhich mutagenic reverse transcription helps the host to adapt\nto changing environmental conditions, particularly for CPR bac-\nteria and DPANN archaea, in which DGRs are particularly abun-\ndant (Paulet al.2017; Rouxet al.2020).\nGonz´alez-Delgado et al. 15\nTherecentlyproposed‘pan-immunesystem’modelsuggests\nthat, even if a particular strain does not have genes encoding all\ntypes of defense systems, the pan-genome of a mixed popula-\ntion of strains potentially encodes a battery of defense systems\nthat protects the whole population (Bernheim and Sorek 2019).\nAccording to the implications of this model, it would be worth-\nwhile analyzing the possible co-occurrence of RT-containing\ndefense systems with other immunity systems, to check for\npotential crosstalk between antiviral mechanisms. Such studies\nwould help to unravel the complexity of prokaryotic immunity.\nThe answers to all these questions would have implications\nfor the biotechnological applications of RT-containing systems\nin new fields, such as phage therapy. It might become possible\nto design phages or molecules triggering cell death mediated\nby a retron toxin or by DRT/Abi immunity. Furthermore, natural\nor engineered phages could be used to overcome RT-mediated\nimmunity to kill a particular bacterial strain with precision.\nMoreover, the biochemical characterization of novel RTs may\nleadtothediscoveryofnewfunctionsusefulinhigh-throughput\nRNA technologies, genome editing or continuous gene evolu-\ntion,amongothers.Thissurveyshouldfacilitatetheexperimen-\ntal characterization of novel RT groups and promote additional\nlines of research leading to a better understanding of the roles\nof these prokaryotic RTs and future applications.\nBOX 1.\nRole of group II introns in the origin of eukaryotic life\nRTs may have played a key role in the transition from\nthe simplest RNA molecules to the current DNA world\n(Iyer, Koonin and Aravind2003; Mustafin and Khusnutdi-\nnova 2019). RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) are\nthought to be the evolutionary ancestors of the RT pro-\ntein family (Ellefsonet al. 2016; Koonin et al. 2020). There\nhas been considerable speculation about the evolution of\nRTs since the most recent common ancestor (Eickbush\n1997; Curcio and Belfort 2007). In this scenario, group II\nintrons are believed to be one of the drivers of eukary-\notic evolution, as they are considered to be the ancestors\nof nuclear spliceosomal introns, non-LTR retrotransposons\nand telomerase after colonizing eukaryotes through bac-\nterial endosymbionts that evolved into mitochondria and\nchloroplasts (Lambowitz and Belfort 2015; Novikova and\nBelfort 2017; Haack and Toor2020). It has also been sug-\ngestedthatgroupIIintronproliferationinprimitiveeukary-\notic cells may have promoted the formation of a nuclear\nenvelope to separate splicing from translation (Martin and\nKoonin2006).\nThe spliceosome is an RNP complex, formed by five\nsmall nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and about 80 proteins, which\neliminates introns from pre-mRNA molecules (Wahl, Will\nandL ¨uhrmann2009).ParallelsbetweengroupIIintronsand\nspliceosomal introns suggest that the later ones evolved\nfrom group II introns by fragmentation and reassembly\n(Chalamcharla, Curcio and Belfort 2010;Q u et al. 2014).\nFunctionally, both elements require two transesterification\nreactions for splicing, with a bulged adenosine involved in\nthe first step (Lambowitz and Belfort2015). Structurally, the\norganization of the active site of the group II intron RNP\nis similar to that of the yeast spliceosome (Agrawal, Wang\nand Belfort2016;Q uet al.2016), and the architecture of the\nmaturase domain of various group II introns is similar to\nthat of Prp8 in the spliceosome complex (Zhao and Pyle\n2016). All these similarities suggest a strong relationship\nbetweengroupIIintronsandthespliceosome.Ontheother\nhand,theRTsofgroupIIintrons,non-LTRretrotransposons\nand telomerase act through analogous mechanisms, sug-\ngesting that ancestral group II introns also gave rise to\nthese other elements (Eickbush and Malik2002). Once non-\nLTR-retrotransposons had evolved from group II introns,\nthey may have given rise to other more complex retroele-\nments, such as LTR-retrotransposons, through the incorpo-\nration of an integrase. Finally, retroviruses are believed to\nhave evolved from LTR-elements by incorporating envelope\ngenes from other viruses (Eickbush and Jamburuthugoda\n2008; Finnegan2012).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nA.G.-D. and M.R.

{"text": "LETTER\nPrecise genome editing without exogenous\ndonor DNA via retron editing system in human\ncells\nDear Editor ,\nCRISPR-Cas9 mediated seamless genome editing can be\nachieved by incorporating donor DNA into the CRISPR-Cas9\ntarget loci via homology-directed repair (HDR), albeit with\nrelative low ef ﬁciency due to the inef ﬁcient delivery of\nexogenous DNA (Cox et al., 2015; Gao, 2021). Retrons are\nbacterial phage-defense related operons composed of a\nspecialized reverse transcriptase (RT) and a relevant non-\ncoding RNA (ncRNA) which can be partially reverse tran-\nscribed by RT initiating at a conserved guanosine\n(G) residue to produce a multicopy single-stranded DNA\n(msDNA) (Yee et al., 1984; Millman et al., 2020). After being\nreverse transcribed, the msDNA is usually covalently teth-\nered to the ncRNA through the 2 ′,5′-phosphodiester bond\nbetween the priming G in ncRNA and 5 ′ end of msDNA\n(Dhundale et al., 1987). The reverse transcription process, of\nwhich the specialized RT recognizes the unique secondary\nstructure of retron ncRNA, is highly speci ﬁc (Hsu et al.,\n1989). Additionally, desired msDNA can be generated in vivo\nby replacing the dispensable region of retron ncRNA with\ndesired sequences (Mirochnitchenko et al., 1994; Simon\net al., 2019). Therefore, retrons are promising biological\nsources for in vivo generation of DNA donors for HDR-me-\ndiated precise genome editing.\nRecently, several studies have shown that retrons cou-\npled with CRISPR-Cas9 could enhance precise genome\nediting via HDR in bacterium and yeast through fusing guide\nRNA (gRNA) to the 3 ′ end of retron ncRNA, producing\nmulticopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) covalently tethered\nto gRNA (Sharon et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2020; Schubert\net al., 2021). In this study, we further engineered retrons by\nfusing Cas9 with E. coli RT from different clades and joining\ngRNA at the 5 ′ end of retron ncRNA, and found that retron\nediting can achieve precise genome editing ef ﬁciently in\nhuman cells. By co-expression of Cas9-RT fusions and ret-\nron-ncRNA gRNA (rgRNA) in HEK293T cells, we demon-\nstrated the rate of retron editing-mediated HDR events at\nendogenous genomic loci was up to 10%. We expect our\nretron editing system could aid in advancing the ex vivo and\nin vivo therapeutic applications of retrons.\nGiven that HDR-mediated precise editing can be\nenhanced by increasing the local abundance of donor DNA,\nand CRISPEY strategy showed highly ef ﬁcient editing in\nyeast genome by in situ expressing retron-gRNA chimeric\nmolecule (Sharon et al., 2018). Therefore, we attempted to\nin situ reverse transcribe the donor msDNA covalently teth-\nered to gRNA by fusing retron ncRNA at the 5 ′ or 3 ′ end of\ngRNA, termed as the retron-ncRNA gRNA (rgRNA) (Fig.\n1A\nand 1B). Four experimentally validated E. coli retrons were\nevaluated for in vivo production of msDNA in human cells\n(Figs. 1B and S1). Additionally, we fused retron RT to the\namino terminus or carboxy terminus of Cas9 with XTEN\nlinker to increase the spatial proximity between RT and\nCas9, which may enhance the retron editing in human cells\nby increasing the abundance of donor msDNA in the vicinity\nof DSB stimulated by Cas9 (Fig. 1B).\nWe ﬁrst sought to test the relative abundance of msDNA\nin human cells. We found all of four selected RTs enabled the\nexpression of msDNA in human cells, and retron RT com-\nbining with 3 ′ rgRNA showed higher expression of msDNA\ncomparing to that with 5 ′ rgRNA (Fig. 1C). The results indi-\ncated that retron RT were reverse transcription-functional in\nhuman cells, inspiring us to further study the potential of\nretron editing at human endogenous genomic loci.\nNext, we investigated the potential of retron editing in\nhuman HEK293T cells (Figs. 2 and S2). We transfected the\nHEK293T cells with plasmids expressing different Cas9-RT\nfusions targeting EMX1 locus and HEK3 site (Anzalone\net al., 2019), and plasmids expressing 5 ′ rgRNA or 3 ′ rgRNA\nthat can produce msDNA with 120 nucleotide (nt)-long\nhomology donor sequences as well (Fig. 2A and 2B). To\ndetermine the retron editing-mediated HDR ef ﬁciency at\nEMX1 and HEK3, we performed deep sequencing. Among\nfour retrons tested, Ec86, Ec73 and Ec107 achieved varying\ndegrees of precise editing and Ec73 combining with\nCRISPR-Cas9 showed highest activity, up to 10% (Fig. 2C).\nRestriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), con-\nﬁrmed the deep sequencing results (Fig. S2A). In addition,\nretron editing with shortened homology donor sequences (90\nnt) also enabled precise editing, including insertions and\ntransversions (Fig. S2B). To test that retron editing is RT\n© The Author(s) .

As expected, compared with Cas9 fused with wild-\ntype Ec73, Cas9 fused with dEc73 or Cas9 only dramatically\nreduced the retron editing-mediated HDR ef ﬁciency\n(Fig. 2D). Together, our results indicated that Cas9-Ec73 RT\nfusion combining with 3 ′ Ec73 rgRNA can be harnessed for\nefﬁcient precise genome editing in human cells (Fig. 2E). Of\nnote, besides HDR events, we detected relatively high fre-\nquency of indels simulated by retron editing system (Figs. S2\nand S4), suggesting Cas9-RT fusions co-expressing with\nrelevant rgRNA retained the double stranded DNA cleavage\nactivity of Cas9.\nIn addition, four of reported CRISPR-Cas9 off-target sites\nrelative to EMX1 locus were checked to determine the off-\ntargeting effects of retron editing (Fig. S5). Although, Cas9-\nEc73RT with rgRNA induced similar rate of indels at on-\ntarget sites as Cas9 with sgRNA (Fig. S5B), Cas9-Ec73RT\nwith rgRNA showed reduced activity at the four known off-\ntarget sites, with 4.9-fold lower average frequency than that\nof Cas9 with sgRNA. To be noted, the off-targeting effects of\nmsDNA should be checked before further application of\nretron editing, although the frequency of random insertion of\nssDNA is much lower than that of dsDNA.\nThe ability to write any modi ﬁcation of interest into the\ngenome is a long-sought goal of biotechnology. Retrons,\ncapable of producing intracellular ssDNA as donor with high\nspeciﬁcity, are promising biological sources for precise\ngenome editing. In this study, we demonstrate that different\nretrons are functional in human cells. Moreover, by co-ex-\npressing Cas9-RT fusions and 3 ′ extended retron-ncRNA\ngRNA, retron editing could mediate precise genome editing\nin human cell. Compared with ssDNA-mediated HDR in\n293T cells, no exogenous ssDNA donor is required in retron\nediting system.\nFigure 1. Retron-mediated generation of msDNA in human cells . (A) Schematic representing retron-mediated msDNA\nproduction. Retrons are composed of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and a speci ﬁc reverse transcriptase (RT). The msr and msd region of\nretron ncRNA form secondary structure which can be speci ﬁcally recognized by relevant retron RT reverse transcribing part of msd\nregion, generating multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). After reverse trancription, the msd template is degraded by RNase H.\nThe replaceable region of ncRNA, in which the donor sequence is inserted, is marked by red-dotted box. Red circle indicates 2 ′,5′-\nphosphodiester bond between 2 ′ end of priming guanosine (G) and 5 ′ end of the msDNA. (B) Plasmids construction strategies for\nretron-mediated generation of msDNA in human cells. Human codon-optimized RT-XTEN-spCas9 fusions are driven by the CAG\npromoter, whereas the 5 ′ extended retron-ncRNA gRNA (5 ′ rgRNA), in which the retron ncRNA is fused to the 5 ′ of gRNA, or 3 ′\nrgRNA, is driven by the EF1 α promoter. Four E. coli retrons (Ec48 RT, Ec73 RT, Ec86 RT and Ec107 RT) from different clades were\nused in our retron editing system. The replaceable region of retron ncRNA was replaced by a 122 nt modi ﬁed HEK3 sequencce.\n(C) Determination of msDNA level. The msDNA abundance was determined by PCR. PCR was conducted using the DdeI digested\nproduct as template.\n900 © The Author(s)\nProtein & Cell\nLETTER Xiangfeng Kong et al.\nAdditionally, retrons coupled with CRISPR can ef ﬁciently\ninsert a GFP gene in yeast with ef ﬁciency up to 87% (Sharon\net al., 2018), making us anticipating retron editing a more\nversatile genome editor in both therapeutic applications and\ncrop improvement. Precise genome editing on locus corre-\nsponding to agronomic traits can greatly accelerate the crop\nbreeding (Mao et al., 2019; Gao, 2021). Although, base\ntransversions, small insertion and deletion by base editors\nand prime editors have been successfully achieved in plant\ncells (Gao, 2021). However, HDR-mediated large fragment\ninsertions cannot be ef ﬁciently achieved due to the low HDR\nefﬁciency and limit of exogenous donor DNA delivery in plant\ncells (Gao, 2021). Therefore, it is interesting to test the\npossibility of using retron editing for large fragment insertion\nin plant cells.\nMany approaches may be done to improve retron editing\nin human cells. Firstly, identi ﬁcation of more suitable retron\nfor genome editing in human cells. Second, engineered\nevolution of both retron-RTand retron-ncRNA can be done to\nenhance retron mediated intracellular production of ssDNA.\nFinally, evidences were shown that hRAD51 mutant fused to\nCas9 (D10A) nickase (RDN) fusions could mediate precise\ngenome editing without DSBs (Rees et al., 2019). It is\nplausible to anticipate that combination of retrons with RDN\nmay make retron editing more accurate and safer due to the\nelimination of Cas9-induced DSBs.\nFigure 2.

Increasing\nthe genetic diversity of crop species is essential to improve their yield and enhance food security. Synthetic directed evolution (SDE)\nemploys localized sequence diversification (LSD) of gene sequence and selection pressure to evolve gene variants with better fitness,\nimproved properties and desired phenotypes. Recently, CRISPR–Cas-dependent and -independent technologies have been applied for\nLSD to mediate synthetic evolution in diverse species, including plants. SDE holds excellent promise to discover, accelerate and expand\nthe range of traits of the value in crop species. Here, we highlight the efficient SDE approaches for the LSD of plant genes, selection\nstrategies and critical traits for targeted improvement. We discuss the potential of emerging technologies, including CRISPR–Cas base\nediting, retron editing, EvolvR and prime editing, to establish efficient SDE in plants. Moreover, we cover CRISPR–Cas-independent\ntechnologies, including T7 polymerase editor for continuous evolution. We highlight the key challenges and potential solutions of\napplying SDE technologies to improve the plant traits of the value.\nKey words:synthetic directed evolution (SDE); localized sequence diversification (LSD); CRISPR–Cas systems; retrons; prime editing;\ntrait engineering\nGraphical abstract\nSubmitted: 19 May 2021;Received (in revised form):4 August 2021;Accepted: 23 August 2021\n© The Author(s) 2021.

Human beings have\nmodified our crops over more than the past 10 000 years by select-\ning desired and improved traits, resulting in crop domestication\n(1). Modern crops have undergone extensive genetic changes when\ncompared to their wild ancestors. We have also learned that\ngenetic diversity is the basis for crop improvement and food secu-\nrity because it provides a reservoir of largely untapped variation\n(2). The 20th century witnessed the development of methods to\ninduce genetic variation randomly . During the Green Revolution\nin the 1960s and 1970s, improved crops generated via random\nmutagenesis were vital to increasing yield (3).\nLater, in the 1980s and 1990s, methods to precisely modify\nthe genome were established by developing site-specific nucleases\nthat facilitate the generation of targeted double-strand breaks\n(DSBs) in the genome (4). DSBs are then repaired either imprecisely\nvia non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or precisely by homology-\ndirected repair (HDR) (5). The repair of such induced DSBs can be\nharnessed for various genetic outcomes in a user-defined man-\nner. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\n(CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) systems have been\nimplemented in many species to introduce various changes to the\ngenome, including gene knockouts, gene knock-in or replacement,\nbase editing and epigenome editing (6).\nThe power of CRISPR–Cas systems has been exploited to engi-\nneer traits of interest, including disease resistance, yield improve-\nment and tolerance to abiotic stress (7). The functional analysis\nof genes and genomes has also fueled identifying targets of inter-\nest for crop improvement via CRISPR–Cas systems. However,\nalthough to date, CRISPR–Cas systems have largely been imple-\nmented to engineer the genome locally (8, 9), induce RNA inter-\nference (10, 11) or detect nucleic acids (12, 13), they can also be\npowerful tools to explore, interrogate and unlock the potential of\nplant cells.\nA typical synthetic directed evolution (SDE) cycle involves gen-\nerating a pool of gene variants, screening while applying specific\nselective pressure and identifying those gene variants that evoke\nthe desired phenotype; the resulting variants are then ampli-\nfied and subjected to another cycle of SDE (Figure 1). This pro-\ncess mimics natural selection but in an accelerated form (14).\nUnlike the rational design of biomolecules, which requires a\ndetailed knowledge of the structure and function of the protein\nor biomolecule under consideration, in SDE, you usually ‘get what\nyou select for,’ with no prior knowledge required.\nSDE endows existing biomolecules with new functions, allow-\ning them to accomplish new tasks (15). For example, during the\nSDE of an enzyme, the enzyme may initially function poorly on a\nnew substrate. However, variants are generated through multiple\nrounds of sequence diversification and screening until they can\nuse the new substrate. This emerging technology has gained some\nrecognition, as Frances Arnold was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize\nin Chemistry for her work on the directed evolution of enzymes\n(16).\n1. Developing technologies for SDE\nBecause of the ease of selection, the SDE of plant genes has been\nemployed in heterologous hosts, thereby limiting the power of SDE\ndue to the lack of optimal codon usage, proper folding and the\ncomplexity of the metabolic environment. Only a few successful\ncases of SDE have been reported in heterologous hosts (17). There\nis a pressing need to establish directed evolution in plants in their\ncellular context to harness the power of this approach. The imple-\nmentation of a synthetic biology pipeline consisting of the steps\nFigure 1.Schematic representation of SDE. Basic SDE involves three key\nstages: gene diversification, selection and amplification. Initially , the\ntarget gene of interest can be employed for localized diversification\nusing several molecular diversification tools. Later, the generated variant\ngene pool will be subjected to the iterative selection pressure to enrich\nthe variants with superior functional qualities. In the final stage, the\nfunctional gene variants can be employed for further continuous gene\ndiversification to amplify the superior functional characteristics.\n(i) design; (ii) build; (iii) test and (iv) learn should allow the\nsuccessful application of SDE to plant systems (Figure 2).\nDeveloping methods to generate localized sequence diversifi-\ncation (LSD) is the key to SDE applications. SDE has employed\nmany methods geared toward this goal, including mutagenesis\nvia error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR shuffling,\nrecombineering, hypermutator strains or error-prone replication\non an orthogonal plasmid (14). CRISPR-based methods harness\nthe power of CRISPR–Cas systems to generate localized sequence\nvariation via NHEJ/HDR (17). Several approaches have been imple-\nmented in prokaryotes that support HDR, including multiplexed\noligo-nucleotide-mediated genome editing ( 18). In eukaryotes,\nbase editors fused to the Cas enzyme can provide a means for\nsequence diversification at targeted break sites ( 19, 20). Other\nsequence diversification modalities, including EvolvR, retrons\nmediated and CRISPR–Cas-independent T7 polymerase-driven\ncontinuous editing (TRACE) system, have been harnessed for\ndirected evolution applications in different organisms (21–23).\n2. SDE in plants\nWe adapted CRISPR–Cas systems to establish an in planta SDE\nplatform (24). We selected rice (Oryza sativa) splicing factor 3b\n(SF3B1) as our initial target for SDE. SF3B1 is a subunit of the\nSF3B spliceosome complex of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleopro-\ntein (U2SnRNP) complex. The splicing inhibitor drug herboxidiene\n(GEX1A) and pladienolide B (PB) bind to SF3B1 and block splicing.\nWe reasoned that targeting SF3B1 for SDE might produce variants\nresistant to GEX1A and PB. We, therefore, designed, constructed\nand delivered a tiled library of sgRNAs covering the entireSF3B1\ncoding sequence for targeted mutagenesis. BecauseSF3B1 is an\nessential gene, all sgRNAs were designed to introduce DSBs and\nG.S. Rao et al. 3\nFigure 2.SDE for successful application in plants. The synthetic biology pipeline implementation includes the following steps to allow the successful\napplication of SDE to plant systems. (1) Design, the user has to design thein vivoadaptable SDE tools. This might include the codon optimization of\nSDE reagents, identification of target gene and designing of DRT, gRNA/pegRNA libraries and pTarget designing for target gene SDE. (2) Build, the\noptimized SDE tools (CRISPR–Cas dependent and independent) need to be cloned into the efficient plant expression binary vectors and construct the\nlibraries to target the corresponding genes. (3) Test, theAgrobacterium cells harboring the SDE tools will be mobilized into plant tissue via,\nAgrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation or by gene gun. The selection pressure would be implemented to eliminate the undesired plantlets.\n(4) Learn, during this stage, the obtained plantlets would be subjected to phenotyping and genotyping. The functional gene variants and evolved\nproteins will be detected. For continuous gene diversification or to enrich the functional characteristics in the selected plant, the user can proceed for\nseveral rounds of design-build-test-learn synthetic evolution cycle.\nin-frame mutations may retain normal splicing function, with\nthe hope that one or more gene-editing events would disrupt\nthe binding site of GEX1A or PB. Accordingly , we recovered sev-\neral mutants, which we termed SGR for SF3B1–GEX1A resistant,\nthat conferred resistance to GEX1A and carried single or multiple\namino acid deletions or substitutions.\nWe then conducted a structural analysis of the binding\nbetween GEX1A and the SGR mutants, revealing that these vari-\nants indeed cannot bind GEX1A. The plants harboring these SGR\nSF3B1 mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type, suggest-\ning their spliceosome is fully functional. We also treated wild-type\nand mutant plants with GEX1A and PB; notably , the SGR mutants\nwere resistant to PB, thus providing compelling evidence that\nthese two drugs share the same target site and that their binding\nmay be similar. Finally , we tested the effects of GEX1A treatment\non splicing in the wild-type and the SGR mutants, which revealed\nthat the SGR mutants retain close to full splicing activity; one\nof the mutants tested, SGR4, appeared completely insensitive to\nGEX1A (24). This example illustrates the power of SDE to evolve\nvariants that remain functional (in this case: splicing) and also\nevolve new functions (here, resistance to PB and GEX1A).\nOther examples showing the power of directed evolution\nwere recently reported, using a dual base editor to evolve rice\nacetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), whose activity is inhibited\nby the herbicide haloxyfop, leading to growth retardation. New\nACC variants were generated that conferred resistance to haloxy-\nfop by targeting ACC by dual-based editors for continuous C to\nT and A to G modifications. Indeed, gene-edited seedlings har-\nboring the ACC mutations P1927F and W2125C were resistant to\nthe herbicide, providing another example of the applicability of\nCRISPR systems to synthetic evolution (19). Recently , Kaunget al.\ndeveloped enhanced bispyribac sodium herbicide-tolerant rice\ngermplasm containing the P171F variant of acetolactate synthase\n1 (ALS1). In their study , theOsALS1 gene was targeted by nCas9\n(D10A)-base editors together with the sgRNA library covering the\nfull-length coding region (20).\n3. Potential SDE tools for LSD in plants\nFor SDE in plants, effective technologies and approaches will need\nto be developed and optimized for LSD, screening, and selec-\ntion for every target. CRISPR–Cas-based systems can now be\nused to generate LSD in plants (17). Precisely , a library of single-\nguide RNAs (sgRNAs) covering a given region of a gene of interest\nis introduced into Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) for\nCRISPR–Cas-mediated gene editing in the target plant tissue (25).\n4 Synthetic Biology,2021, Vol. 6, No. 1\nAs described before, the sequence variation via CRISPR-induced\nNHEJ is possible when targeting an essential gene by SDE since\nmost mutants will be non-viable (Figure 3A). New CRISPR-based\napproaches are emerging for LSD in plants. For example, base\nediting generates edits without DSBs and with the larger editing\nwindow size of+50 to −50 relative to PAM sequence (17, 26). There-\nfore, the complete sequence of a gene may be subjected to base\nediting by combining a library of sgRNAs with CRISPR-base editors\nfor SDE in plants (Figure 3A).\nOther possible approaches may include the HDR-based retron\ntechnology , which brings the repair templates closer to the DSB\nsite. For example, theE. coliEc86 retron was coupled with CRISPR\nand Cas9 to enrich ssDNAs at the targeted locations for DSB\nrepair via HDR in yeast cells (27). Therefore, this method relied\nFigure 3.Potential SDE tools for LSD in plants. Target gene LSD can be achieved by CRISPR–Cas-dependent and -independent SDE tools. (A) Several\nCRISPR–Cas-dependent SDE tools, (i) Cas9 protein together with the library of sgRNAs targeting a complete gene can cause NHEJ-mediated LSD,\n(ii) Retron editing: Cas9 fusion with Ec86 RT together with the library of retron-DRT -sgRNA targeting the complete gene can produce any N to N\nconversions or HDR-mediated LSD, (iii) Base editing: nCas9 (D10A) fused with any base editor together with the library of sgRNAs targeting the\ncomplete gene will generate C:G to T:A or A:T to G:C conversions near the nick regions, (iv) EvolvR: nCas9 (D10A) fused with error-prone DNA\npolymerase together with the library of sgRNAs targeting the complete gene can generate random mutations and cause LSD, (v) Prime editing: nCas9\n(H840A) and M-MLV RT together with the library of pegRNAs containing the designed mutations can generate any N to N conversions or\nHDR-mediated LSD in the target gene. (B) CRISPR–Cas-independent TRACE (T7 polymerase-driven continuous editing) can generate sequence\ndiversification in the target gene. The fusion of T7 RNA polymerase and AID base editor (pEditor) will diversify the target gene controlling by T7\npromoter (pTarget) via C:G to T:A conversions.\nG.S. Rao et al. 5\non a library of repair templates fused with sgRNA for local-\nized ssDNA production and targeted HDR to generate diversified\nvariants in plants (Figure 3A). Another enzyme-based EvolvR tech-\nnology uses nCas9 (D10A) with a bacterial error-prone DNA poly-\nmerase (PolI3M) and thioredoxin-binding domain together with a\ntarget-specific sgRNA to produce continuous LSD in bacteria (23).\nnCas9 creates a single-stranded nick, from which the nCas9 cou-\npled error-prone DNA polymerase synthesizes new mutant DNA\nstrands. Halperinet al.showed enhanced sequence diversification\nrates with an editing window of up to+56 to +350 nucleotides\nfrom the nick in prokaryotes (23). The design and employing\nlibrary of sgRNAs targeting complete gene by EvolvR technology\ncan generate various functional gene variants (Figure 3A).\nNovel prime editing technology has been successfully used\nto incorporate genetic information at the target sites into the\ngenome, without DSBs. In prime editing, reverse transcriptase is\ntargeted to nicked DNA, and the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA)\nharbors the edited sequence (28). Several groups have reported\nlow editing efficiency when using prime editors in plants (29, 30).\nWe recently applied prime editors for the precise engineering of\nplant genomes by introducing a single point mutation into the\nrice ALS gene that had been shown to confer bispyribac resistance\nin rice (30). We recovered mutations harboring the engineered\nsequence but with lower efficiency than expected (0.26–2%). We\nhope that editing efficiency can be raised to over 10% to allow the\napplication of prime editors to SDE. It may be possible to design\nand construct a pegRNA library to introduce all possible muta-\ntions in a specific gene sequence and deliver this library to plant\ncells; the regeneration of transgenic plants with a simultaneous\nand constant selective pressure may recover superior variants\n(Figure 3A). Since the Cas activity istrans, the edited T -DNA-free\nplants are transgene free. Conventionally , the CRISPR–Cas-edited\nT -DNA-free plants can be selected by the genetic segregation,\nback crossing and genotyping methods (3). Therefore, the CRISPR-\ndependent SDE tools can develop transgene-free plants with the\nsuperior phenotypes after the T -DNA segregation step.\nCRISPR-independent methods exist: as mentioned before the\nTRACE, a T7 RNA polymerase fused to activation-induced cyti-\ndine deaminase (AID) base editor (pEditor) will bind to the T7\npromoter driving the expression of a gene of interest (pTarget)\n(21). During transcription, the base editor comes close to the DNA\nintended for editing, leading to base editing over an expanded\nwindow of a few hundred base pairs. This system offers a power-\nful approach for continuous directed evolution (Figure 3B). Unlike\nCRISPR-dependent tools, the TRACE cannot generate transgene-\nfree plants. In TRACE system, the target gene with in the T -DNA\nis regulated by T7 promoter in acis-regulatory manner. So, the\nT -DNA-free plants are always unedited. However, this technique\nworks best in cell cultures; any testing in whole plants will neces-\nsitate engineering the identified edits into the plant genome using\none of the CRISPR-based methods described above.\n4. Selection strategies\nFollowing sequence diversification, the selection is a crucial stage\nduring which the population of variants is selected to recover\nvariants with strong genotype–phenotype linkage and enable the\nisolation of evolved variants with the desired function(s). The\nselection of evolved variants is the key to the successful applica-\ntion of SDE. Although selection may take many forms, the most\npowerful and easiest form of selection is linked to the survival\nof the cell or the organism (31). For applications in plants, the\ndirected evolution of herbicide resistance would constitute one of\nthe most straightforward applications of SDE.\nOther selection criteria may be applicable, such as changes\nin color or morphology , yield and resilience to biotic and\nabiotic factors, but implementing these would be more time-\nconsuming. A number of clones will pass through the selection\nprocess, although they do not confer the desired phenotype\n(false positives), while other clones with the desired genotype\nnevertheless do not survive the selection stage (false nega-\ntives). Since there will be a strong linkage between genotype\nand phenotype in one population, replication will minimize false\npositives.\n5. Key traits for improvement\nSDE can be used to engineer the key traits of value. Engi-\nneering herbicide resistance is a clear goal. For example,\n‘5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)’ in rice\ncan be targeted to improve the resistance to the herbicide\nglyphosate. Enhancing crop tolerance against different herbicides\nis essential to reduce competition with several weed species.\nOther valuable traits that may be subjected to SDE includ-\ning an enhanced photosynthesis rate by diversifying ‘ribulose-\n1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)’, abiotic stress\nresistance by evolving ‘isoprene synthase’ and ‘pyrabactin\nresistance1/pyr1-like4 (PYL4)’, increased plant protection and pro-\nductivity by modifying ‘ascorbate peroxidase’, increased number\nof tillers and yield by evolving ‘carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7\n(CCD7)’, improved grain yield and immunity against pathogens by\ndiversifying ‘ideal plant architecture 1 (IPA1)’, and for producing\nmore superfoods by raising carotene and anthocyanin contents.\nTrait improvement by promoter engineering is one of the\nimportant approaches. Promoters are thecis-regulatory noncod-\ning DNA sequences that influence the gene expression levels.\nSeveral recent studies demonstrated the role of promoter editing\nin crop improvement and disease resistance (32, 33). Therefore,\nthe SDE technologies can also be employed for the evolution of\na specific promoter by targeting the promoter at multiple loca-\ntions. The evolved promoters can generate beneficial quantitative\nvariation in the expression of downstream-regulated gene.\n6. Conclusion\nSDE has revolutionized trait engineering all across a wide commu-\nnity , releasing the laborious and time-consuming fitness burdens\nfrom traditional strategies. Whereas limited by the availability\nof the efficient SDE tools for LSD, the power of trait engineer-\ning in plants is still underestimated. We summarized potential\nSDE tools, selection strategies and essential plant traits that can\nbe improved via SDE in this viewpoint. We envision that SDE\nwill unlock the potential of trait engineering to develop superior\ncrop varieties resilient to climate change with improved yield and\nquality to support global food security .\nFunding\nKAUST core funding to M.M.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank members of the genome engineering and\nsynthetic biology laboratory at KAUST for critical discussions.\n6 Synthetic Biology,2021, Vol. 6, No. 1\nAuthor contributions\nM.M. conceived the idea for the paper and all three authors wrote\nthe manuscript.\nConflict of interest statement.None declared.\nAbbreviations\nSDE, synthetic directed evolution; LSD, localized sequence diver-\nsification; Pro, promoter; ter, terminator.\nReferences\n1.

Different classes of RTs can play dif-\nferent roles, such as template switching and mobil-\nity in group II introns, spacer acquisition in CRISPR-\nCas systems, mutagenic retrohoming in DGRs, pro-\ngrammed cell suicide in Abi systems, and recently\ndiscovered phage defense in retrons. While some\nclasses of RTs have been studied extensively, oth-\ners remain to be characterized. There is a lack of\ncomputational tools for identifying and characteriz-\ning various classes of RTs. In this study, we built a\ntool (called myRT) for identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation\nof prokaryotic RTs. In addition, our tool provides in-\nformation about the genomic neighborhood of each\nRT, providing potential functional clues. We applied\nour tool to predict RTs in all complete and draft bac-\nterial genomes, and created a collection that can be\nused for exploration of putative RTs and their as-\nsociated protein domains. Application of myRT to\nmetagenomes showed that gut metagenomes en-\ncode proportionally more RTs related to DGRs, out-\nnumbering retron-related RTs, as compared to the\ncollection of reference genomes. MyRT is both avail-\nable as a standalone software (https://github.com/\nmgtools/myRT) and also through a website (https:\n//omics.informatics.indiana.edu/myRT/).\nINTRODUCTION\nA reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme that converts\nRNA into double stranded cDNA, and was discovered in\n1970 in retroviruses (1). A well-known RT in retroviruses is\nHIV-1 RT, with DNA polymerase and RNase H enzymatic\nactivities(2).Alltheretrotransposons(LTRandnon-LTR)\nhave RT genes (3). Bacterial RTs were first found in retrons\nretroelements. Bacterial RTs can also be found in bacte-\nrial defense systems against phages, e.g. in CRISPR-Cas\nsystems and abortive infection systems (AbiA, AbiK and\nAbiP2) (4). RTs are also found in Diversity Generating\nRetroelements (DGRs) that facilitate tropism switching in\nphages,andacceleratetheevolutionofbacteriaandarchaea\n(5).AnotherimportantclassofRTscanbefoundinmobile\nretroelements such as group II introns (GII/G2I) (6).\nRTs involved in group II introns are the most abundant\nclassofRTsinbacteria,andencode57–75%ofthebacterial\nRTs (4,6).BacterialgroupIIintronsareself-splicingmobile\nelements,eachconsistingofacatalyticRNAandanintron-\nencodedprotein(IEP)withintheRNA.TheIEPcontainsa\nRT domain and an X/thumb domain with maturase activ-\nity,alongwithDNAbinding(D)andendonuclease(En)do-\nmains(4,7).GroupIIintronRTsandtheirtemplateswitch-\ningmechanismsareusedindifferentgeneandgenomeedit-\ningtechniquesincludingtargetronandthermotargetron( 8–\n11).\nRetrons encode 12–14% of the bacterial RTs and are\nthe second most frequent class of RTs (4,6). Although\nretrons were discovered three decades ago, their function\nremained unknown until recently that they were found to\nfunction as phage defense mechanisms (12,13). Bacterial\nretronsarenon-LTR-retroelementsthatproducemulticopy\nsingle-stranded DNAs (msDNAs). Most retrons consist of\nmsr-msd sequence and a RT gene. Retrons can also encode\ntoxin/antitoxin systems, which can be triggered or blocked\nby phage proteins (14,15). Retron RTs have been sug-\ngested as a tool for precise genome editing techniques (e.g.\nCRISPEY, SCRIBE and HiSCRIBE) as retrons can pro-\nduce msDNA, and edit the target sequences (6,\n11,16,17).\nRTgenesareanessentialcomponentofDiversityGener-\nating Retroelements (DGRs) (18). DGRs are found in bac-\nteria, archaea and phages (19). DGRs are beneficial to the\nevolution and survival of their host; for instances, they can\nmediate tropism switching in Bordetella phage (20), medi-\nate bacterial surface display (21), have a role in regulatory\npathway tuning (22), and impact the underlying temper-\nate phage-bacteria interactions in human gut microbiome\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

RTs in DGR systems are special, in the sense that\nthey are error-prone. The RTs generate hyper-variable re-\ngions in specific target genes (e.g., genes encoding for tail\nfibre proteins and receptors), through a process called mu-\ntagenic retrohoming in which a template region (TR) is re-\nversed transcribed into mutagenized cDNA(A-to-Nmuta-\ntions),andthemutagenizedcDNAreplacesaregion(called\nvariableregion,VR)inthetargetgenewhichissimilartothe\nTRregion( 5).AnalysesofthetargetgenesofDGRsystems\nhave shown that some pfam domains commonly encoded\nby target genes include, but are not limited to DUF1566,\nFGE-sulfatase, and Fib\nsucc major (25).\nRTs are also found in three types of abortive bacterio-\nphage infection (Abi) systems including AbiA, AbiK and\nAbiP2 (4,26,27). Abi systems are a type of bacterial de-\nfense mechanisms that can lead to programmed death of\na phage-infected cell, in order to protect the surrounding\ncell(s), and are often encoded by phages (e.g. P2 prophage\nof E.coli), and plasmids of bacterial genomes such asLac-\ntococcus lactis(28). L. lactishas more than 22 different\nabortive infection systems (AbiA to AbiV) (29), among\nwhich, only two of them (AbiA and Abik) have a RT do-\nmain. Although AbiA and AbiK only share 23% identity,\nthey both can stop phage P335 maturation by means of\nun-templatedsynthesisofaDNAcovalentlybondedtothe\nreverse transcriptase domain in order to target the Rad52-\nlikephagerecombinases( 30).C-terminalHEPNdomainof\nAbiA(HEPN\nAbiA CTD),whichmaypromotecellsuicide\nthrough RNase activity, is fused to RT encoded by a gene\nfoundinanoperoncontainingothergenesincludingrestric-\ntion modification system (RM system) (29).\nRT genes are found in some classes of CRISPR-Cas (the\nbacterial adaptive immune) systems including several sub-\nsetsoftypeIII(III-A,III-B,III-C,andIII-D)andtypeVI-\nA CRISPR-Cas systems that can acquire spacers directly\nfrom both DNA and RNA (31).

CRISPR-Cas RTs are believed\nto have been emerged from multiple occasions: CRISPR-\nCas RTs in archaea (Methanomicrobia) branch from class\nF of group II introns, CRISPR-Cas RT (ABX04564.1) in\nHerpetosiphon aurantiacusfalls into the group II intron\nclade, CRISPR-Cas RT inHaliscomenobacter hydrossisis\nrelatedtoretronR T s(34).CRISPR-CasRTin Haemophilus\nhaemolyticus is related to AbiP2 RTs, and is associated\nwith type I-C CRISPR-Cas systems (35). These are the\nexamples showing association of Retron and AbiP2 RTs\nwith CRISPR-Cas systems.Streptomycesspp. has several\nCRISPR-Cas RTs associated with type I-E CRISPR sys-\ntems. As RNA activity is not common in type I CRISPR\nsystems,experimentalstudyoftheseCRISPR-CasRTsmay\nresult in interesting findings (36).\nUncharacterized RTs are encoded by conserved ORFs\nin bacterial genomes, but their exact function and classifi-\ncation are unknown. Nevertheless, a few studies have sug-\ngested groupings of these RTs based on different criteria\nsuchaspreviouslypublisheddata,sequenceconservationof\nthe RT motifs, and similarity of their fused protein motifs\n(4,6,37). The genomic neighborhood of these RTs can also\nprovide us with information about the functions of these\nRTs:forinstance,RTsofunknownclasses1and5arefused\nwithnitrilasemotifintheC-terminal,RTsofunknownclass\n3 and class 8 tend to co-occur, unknown class 4 RTs have a\nfimbrial domain, and unknown class 10 of RTs have fused\nprimase domain, suggesting a concerted priming and re-\nverse by the protein that harbors these two domains (6).\nDespitethegrouping,afewRTsremainunclassifiedasthey\ndon’tseemtohaveanycloserelationshipwiththeotherRTs\nin the collected dataset of RTs (6).

There is a database of group II\nintrons (http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/groupii/)(39,40). My-\nDGRisatoolthatwedevelopedforidentificationofDGR\nsystems and their associated RTs (5). However, a tool for\ncharacterization and classification of RTs remains lacking.\nWe provide here the first pipeline for prediction of bacte-\nrial RTs and their classes, accompanied by genomic neigh-\nborhood information and visualizations. Furthermore, our\npre-computedcollectionofputativeRTsinallcompleteand\nbacterial genomes is easily accessible through myRT web-\nserver athttps://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/myRT/.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection of the RT dataset\nWe curated a collection of 1,988 non redundant RTs based\non different sources: CRISPR-Cas associated RTs were\ncollected from (35), group II intron RTs were extracted\nfrom groupii (\n39), DGR RTs were previously collected as\npart of our research on DGRs systems (5) (which inte-\ngrated DGR RTs from multiple sources (25,41–44)), nine\nAbiA (abortive AbiA) representatives were downloaded\nfromCDD( 45),andRTsequencesoftheremainingclasses\nwere extracted from dataset of RTs collected by Toroetal.\n(4,35). As some of these datasets overlap, redundant RTs\nwere removed (using cd-hit (46) cutoff value of 1). This in-\ntegrated dataset contains RTs from group II introns (GII),\nCRISPR-Cas, DGRs, retrons, AbiA, AbiK, AbiP2, G2L,\netc. This classification is mostly based on the grouping of\nRTs in (35), and was verified by us by analyzing the phylo-\ng e n e t i ct r e eo fR V T\n1 motif sequences (see Results).\nConstruction of class-specific HMMs of RVT1 domain for\nRT prediction and classification\nSince all RT sequences contain the RVT1 domain (Pfam\nID:PF00078), weusedtheRVT 1motifsequencestobuild\nclass specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for RTs of\ndifferent classes, which can then be used for identification\nand classification of RTs in genomes and metagenomes.\nFor identification of RVT\n1 domain in RT sequences, we\nused hmmscan (hmmer-3.2) (47) search against the Pfam-\nA model (PF00078) (48), and further validated the predic-\ntionusingCDD-search( 45)andmanualcheck.Hitsoflow\nsignificance or with a short length were manually checked.\nWe noticed that the predicted RT domains in UG2 RTs\nand 15 out of UG28 RTs were split into two fragments in\nPAGE 3OF 13 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.5 e29\nthese proteins, which resulted in poor multiple alignment\nof RT sequences and phylogenetic tree with atypically long\nbranches. Using CDD-search fixed the problem and pro-\nduced a single predicted RVT1 domain in each of these\nsequences. Therefore, we used predicted RVT1 domains\nbased on CDD-searches for these proteins for downstream\nanalyses including multiple alignment and phylogenetic re-\nconstruction.\nWe used Muscle (v3.8.31) (49) to align the extracted\nRVT\n1 domains in the RT sequences, and then used Fast-\nTree2 (50) to build a phylogenetic tree of all the RT se-\nquences, using bootstrap value of 100. By examining the\nphylogenetic tree, in combination with genomic context\nanalysis, we confirmed the grouping of the RT sequences\nin the different classes, and for a small number of cases,\nre-assigned their classes (see Results). We also added new\nclasses. In total, all RTs can be grouped into 41 classes.\nExtracted RVT\n1 domains for each class were aligned\nseparately using Muscle, and after re-formatting the align-\nments from fasta to stockholm, we used hmmbuild (51)t o\nobtain hmm models for each class. Then, all of these hmm\nmodels(fordifferentclasses)werecombinedintoonemodel\n(RVT-All.hmm).\nMyRT for identification and characterization of RTs in\ngenomes and metagenomes\nWe developed myRT for identification of RTs in genomes\nand metagenomes. MyRT is based on similarity search\nagainst the class-specific RT HMMs, facilitated with phy-\nlogenetic analysis by pplacer (52) for the cases when no\nclear classes can be inferred based on similarity search.\nFirst, FragGeneScan (version 1.31) (53) is used to quickly\npredict the protein coding genes in the input genome (or\nmetagenome); however, if prediction of protein coding\ngenes (given in a gff file) is available, protein sequences will\nbe generated based on the input gff file instead. Next, our\npipeline uses predicted protein sequences to find all the\nRVT\n1 domains encoded by the input genome in two steps\n(see Figure1):\n(a) IdentificationofinitialputativeRTproteinsusingafo-\ncusedsearchofRTdomainsinallproteins.Inthisstep,\nhmmscanisusedtosearchallpredictedproteinsagainst\nRVT-All.hmm we created that contains only HMMs\nof class-specific RTs, with e-value of 10\n−3 (-E 0.0001 –\ndomE 0.0001) as the threshold. Proteins that are pre-\ndicted to contain RT domains are considered candi-\ndates. Since RVT-All.hmm only contains RT domains,\nsome of the identified candidates are likely to be false\npositives and need to be filtered out by the following\nstep.\n(b) Refinement of RT protein candidates by expanded\nsearch of domains in the RT candidates. In this step,\nhmmscan is applied to search candidate RT proteins\nagainst HMMs of a large collection of domains (cdd-\npfamA.hmm, which contains a total of 59 083 CDD\nand Pfam-A domains). Candidates that don’t contain\na RT related domain (i.e. RVT\n1, group II RT mat,\nRT G2 intron, etc.) are considered false positives and\nare excluded from further analysis. This step is crucial\nFigure 1.Flowchart of prediction of RTs and their classes. Most RTs can\nbe assigned to specific classes using similarity searches (hmmscan), and\na small number of RTs can be assigned to a specific class by combining\nphylogenetic analysis.\nfor filtering the false positives (e.g. genes containing\nDNA binding domains), and the combination of this\nstep with the previous step provides a fast prediction\nwith a high precision and recall.\nClassification of putative RT proteins is based on the\nabove hmmscan search results, and in some cases an extra\nstepofphylogeneticplacementoftheproteinsinthetreeof\nRTs. Given a putative RT protein, we consider that its RT\nclasscanbeconfidentlyassigned,ifonlyoneclassofRTdo-\nmainisfoundbyhmmscan,orthetophithasasignificantly\nlowerE-value than the rest (i.e.E-value of the second hit is\n10\n5 foldshigherthanthe E-valueofthetophit).Inthecases\nwhen a class cannot be assigned, myRT keeps the top three\nhits, and relies on an extra step based on the placement of\nthe putative RT protein in the phylogenetic tree of known\nRTs for final assignment of the class for the putative RT\nprotein. The phylogenetic tree of known RTs was inferred\nby FastTree2 (with a bootstrap value of 100) using multi-\nplealignmentofRVT\n1domainsequencesastheinput.The\nreferencetree(compatiblewithpplacer)wascompiledusing\nTaxtastic.ToplaceaputativeRTproteininthephylogenetic\ntree,firsthmmalignisusedtocombinetheputativeRTwith\nthereferencehmmmodel.Thenpplacer( 52)isusedtoplace\nthequerysequenceonthetree,andTreeio(v1.10.0)( 54)and\ncastor (55) R packages are used to parse the pplacer result.\nIf the putative RT is placed on a leaf node, then the puta-\ntive RT is assigned the class of the leaf node; otherwise if\nat least 90% of the leaf nodes in the subtree rooted at the\nputative RT share the same class, this class will be assigned\nto the putative RT. The confidence of the prediction at this\nstepwillbedeterminedbasedonlike\nweight ratioreported\nby pplacer, unless pplacer suggests several placements with\nsimilar likeweight ratio, where the difference between sec-\nondlike weight ratioandfirstoneis <0.25,inwhichwewill\nreporttheresultwithaconfidencevalueof0.Finally,ifthe\ne29 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.5 PAGE 4OF 13\npredicted class based on phylogenetic placement is consis-\ntent with hmmscan results (i.e. the prediction is among the\ntop three hmmscan hits), this class will be selected as the\nfinal predicted class for the putative RT; otherwise, myRT\nreportsallpossibleclasses.Wechosetheparametersempir-\nically.\nGenomic neighborhood analysis for putative RTs\nTo provide genomic neighborhood information of puta-\ntive RTs, myRT examines up to four neighboring genes for\neach putative RT (up to two genes downstream, and up\nto two genes upstream of the RT, with a maximum inter-\ngenic region of 2 kbps). The neighboring genes together\nwith the putative RT proteins will be searched against cdd-\npfamA.hmm (using hmmscan and a maximumE-value of\n10\n−3) to annotate the proteins encoded by these genes. The\nresults can be used to infer domains that are frequently\nfused to the RVT\n1 domains of the putative RT proteins,\nandthefrequentdomainsencodedbytheneighboringgenes\nof the RT gene. We note when the predicted class of RT\nis CRISPR, but the putative RT gene has no nearbycas\ngenes (e.g.cas1a n dcas2), myRT will re-assign the class as\nCRISPR-like.ThewebversionofmyRTprovidesvisualiza-\ntion of the prediction of putative RTs along with their ge-\nnomic neighborhood.\nMyRTwebsitealsoprovidesstatisticalanalysisofthedo-\nmains found in RTs and their genomic neighborhood, and\nallowsdomainsearchinthegenomicneighborhoodofRTs.\nFor each RT class, we compiled a list of domains that co-\noccurwiththisspecificclassofRTalongwiththefrequency\nof the co-occurrence in complete and draft genomes. Some\ndomains are ubiquitous while others tend to be associated\nwith a certain type of RT. To quantify the specific associa-\ntion of some domains with the different types of RT genes,\nwe proposed aspecificity scoreof a domain for a particu-\nlar class of RT, which is the number of genomes contain-\ning this domain in the neighborhood of the particular class\nof RT divided by the number of times that the domain is\nfound in the neighborhood of any of the RTs. The speci-\nficity score ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that a\ndomain is exclusively associated with a particular RT class.\nUsingthesetools,wecanseethat46%oftheUG28bRTsco-\noccur with VirE\nN domains (see Supplementary Figure S1\nforthereport),andalthoughonly7%ofRetron-RTsfound\nincompletegenomesco-occurwithPRK10473(MdtLfam-\nily multidrug efflux MFS transporter), among the RTs that\nco-occur with this domain (including 207 Retrons-RT, 2\nGII RTs and 1 UG7-RT), 99% of them were Retron RT\n(i.e.PRK10473ishighlyspecifictoRetronRTwithaspeci-\nficity score of 0.99; see Supplementary Figure S2).\nGenomes and metagenomes\nWe applied myRT to predict putative RTs in reference\ngenomes (including complete and incomplete) and selected\nmetagnenomes. Reference genomes were downloaded from\nthe NCBI ftp website as of 22 October 2020. For com-\nplete genomes, we used NCBI’s prediction of putative cod-\ning genes, whereas for draft genomes, we used FragGeneS-\ncan(53)topredictproteincodinggenes.Formetagenomes,\nthereadsweretrimmedusingTrimmomatic( 56),andpaired\nreads were assembled using MetaSPAdes (53). FragGeneS-\ncanwasthenusedtopredictputativecodinggenesfromthe\nassemblies of the metagenomes.\nRESULTS\nReclassification of some RTs, expansion of rare RT classes\nand addition of new classes\nWe improved the collection of RT sequences and their\nmodels from three different aspects: reclassifying some RT\nsequences that were likely misclassified; adding more se-\nquences for rare RT classes for model construction, and\nadding new RT classes.\nWe first applied the class-specific HMM models to pre-\ndict and assign classes to the sequences in the initial train-\ning dataset. More than 99% of predictions agreed with\nthe old classification. The rest could be either errors in\nthe old classifications or misclassifications introduced by\nmyRT.Weanalyzedthesecasesfurther,combiningtheirse-\nquential, genomic neighborhood, and phylogenetic infor-\nmation. Further we used CRISPRone (57), myDGR (5),\nand groupii (39,40) to confirm RTs involved in CRISPR-\ncas, DGR and group II introns, respectively. We excluded\nthree sequences that don’t contain RVT\n1 domain, includ-\ning YP002455118.1 (WP000385107.1), KQB14190.1 and\nWP 009625650.1. In addition, we were able to revise the\nclassification for a total of 10 RTs summarized in Table1\nand Supplementary Table S1. For example, EGP13976.1 is\noneofthe155DGRRTsidentifiedby( 42),butitistheonly\none (out of 155) that is not part of a DGR system; we re-\ngrouped it as an intron-RT with appended GIIM domain.\nWe improved the hmm models for the classes with few\nrepresentatives. We applied myRT to find putative RTs in\n20 036 complete and 118 883 draft prokaryotic genomes,\nand extracted new RTs that belong to classes with few rep-\nresentatives (including UG15 and UG21). Then, we veri-\nfied the accuracy of these new classifications by adding the\nRVT\n1motifsequenceoftheseputativeRTstothephyloge-\nnetic tree of RTs (see Figure2), to make sure that they fall\nin the right clade. After adding these newly classified RTs\nto the training data, we rebuilt the hmm models for these\nrare classes. For instance, starting from six UG25 RTs, we\nwereabletoincludeanadditionalof19sequencesandused\na total of 25 sequences to build the HMM of UG25.\nWe added new classes of RTs based on a combination\nofsequential,phylogenetictreeandgenomicneighborhood\nanalyses. We divided G2L RTs into three classes (G2L,\nG2Lb, G2Lc) based on their placement on the phyloge-\nnetic tree and how these sequences are clustered together\nin a branch in the phylogenetic tree (see Figure2). Simi-\nlarly we divided UG28 RTs into two classes and called the\nsmaller class UG28b. The hmm of UG28b was built using\n15 sequences that form a separate clade in the phylogenetic\ntree. In addition, UG28 and UG28b RTs have different do-\nmainsintheirgenomicneighborhood––45%ofUG28bRTs\nco-occur with VirE\nN domains. The final RVT-All.hmm\ncontains 45 HMM models (for 41 RT classes; some classes\nhavemorethanonemodel,andCRISPRandCRISPR-like\nshare the same HMM models) built from a total of 1988\nRVT1 sequences.

All results showed that myRT gave accurate\nclassification of RTs. Supplementary Tables S2– S4 provide\naccess of myRT results for these three collections.\nThe first collection contains CRISPR-Cas reverse tran-\nscriptases (branch 1 - branch 10) from (36) that were not\nused in building the hmm models.

Our pipeline did not recognize the\ncas4 gene, only reported a gene encoding GxxExxY do-\nmain, and thus labeled this RT as CRISPR-like. The last\nthree RTs in Supplementary Table S2 are associated with\ntypeI-ECRISPR-systems,haveanadjacent cas3gene ,and\ntwo of them have an adjacent gene encoding AbiEii do-\nmain (atypical for CRISPR-Cas RTs). Although we do not\nhave specific models for these unusual CRISPR-Cas RTs,\nLAKD01000050.1 was correctly predicted as a CRISPR\nRTbymyRT.MyRTpredictedAJKO01000007.1asaUG2\nRT instead of a CRISPR RT, and we believe the original\nannotation in (36) was wrong: the RT gene was found in\nStreptococcusoralis SK10(EIC80228.1),whichencodesfor\natypeICRISPR-Cassystem,butthe casgenesandtheRT\ngene don’t co-locate; and the RT was also annotated as a\nUG2 RT in a later study (35). MyRT couldn’t assign the\nlast two putative RTs (DS570667.1 and CP007699.1) to a\nspecific RT class so annotated them as unclassified (UNC)\nRT. Overall, we estimate that myRT can predict a CRISPR\nRT as CRISPR /CRISPR-like RT with an accuracy\nof 93%.\nWe then tested our model on datasets from (6) (exclud-\ning unclassified RTs). To fairly assess myRT’s performance\nwe excluded RTs that shared more than 87% identity with\nour RT collection. The majority of the retained ones share\n30%-50% identity with our training set which is normal\nconsidering that all of them have conserved RT domains.\ne29 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.5 PAGE 6OF 13\nFigure2.

Most of the predictions\nmatched with the groupings from this collection, except\ntwo putative G2L5 (GII-like-5) RTs, ZP\n01854760.1 and\nZP 01851752.1,from Gimesiamaris DSM8797whichwere\npredictedasG2Lb,andCRISPR-likebymyRT,resultingin\n90% accuracy overall.

Five of these RTs were already in our training set,\nyet the other 11 shared less than 61% sequence identity\nwith the RTs included in our training data. MyRT wasable\nto correctly predict all of them as retron RTs, providing\nan accuracy of 100% (see Table2 and Supplementary Ta-\nble S4). One example is the Ec48 retron system, which has\nproved vigorous defense againstSiphoviridae, Myoviridae\nandPodoviridaephages.Wenoteinthegenomicneighbhor-\nhood of the Ec49 retron system, there are genes encoding\nfor an AbiP2 RT (sharing 99% identity with CAJ43157.1,\nAbiP2RTof EnterobacteriaphageP2-EC58),andotherdo-\nmains include Q (portal vertex) and phage\nGPA (bacterio-\nphage replication gene A protein).\nPutative RTs identified in bacterial genomes\nWe applied myRT to predict putative reverse transcriptase,\nalongside their class in all complete and draft bacterial\ngenomes.

PCC 8802). As seen\nin Figure5 (right), six of these group II intron RTs have a\nfused McrA domain (5-methylcytosine-specific restriction\nendonuclease McrA).\nSurprisingly, we observed that Bacillus thuringiensis\nYBT-1518 and its plasmids have a large number of group\nII intron RTs (74 GII RTs), and one RT with unknown\nfunction, which is similar to class of UG4 RTs, but doesn’t\nhave Fimbrial domain in its genomic neighborhood. Out\nof these 74 RTs, 60 of them are identical to AHA69388.1\n(RT #1) and 3 of them are identical to AHA69975.1\n(RT #6). AHA69975.1 is adjacent to a potential virulence\ngene with VirD4 (Type IV secretory pathway component)\ndomain.\nApplication of myRT to the complete bacterial genomes\nresulted in the identification of 29 AbiA RTs.

For in-\nstance ADE85032.1 was predicted as a CRISPR RT. Had\nwe only used hmm models, it would be predicted as GII\nRT.

This result\nsuggeststheassociationofintronRTsandthemultidrugre-\nsistance.\nA recent work studied the domains associated with\nRetron RTs, and ATPase (COG3950) was one of the do-\nmains found in the genomic neighborhood of Retron RT\ngenes (clade 1 in (63)). Our analysis also revealed this as-\nsociation with a specificity score of 0.96 and 1 in com-\nplete and draft genomes, respectively. The high specificity\nscore for this domain from our analysis provides a quan-\ntitative metric showing the specific association of this do-\nmainwithRetronRTs(butrarelywithRTsofotherclasses).\nOur results also showed several other domains that are\n(almost) exclusively associated with Retron RTs, includ-\ning PRK10473 (MdtL family multidrug efflux MFS trans-\nporter) and PRK08617 (acetolactate synthase, AlsS); by\ncontrast, smart00530 is frequently found in the Retron RT\ngeneneighborhood, however,itisalso frequentlyfoundto-\ngether with group II RT (GII) and other types (see Fig-\nure 7A and B for a comparison). PRK08617 was found in\nthe neighborhood of Retron RT genes in manyS. aureus\ngenomes (including 110 complete and 3319 draft genomes;\nsee Figure7C for an example, and more details at myRT\nwebsite), and is also associated with GII RT but only in\nfour genomes, including oneS. aureusgenome (see Figure\n7D), Bacillusthuringiensis YBT-1518, and two genomes of\nL.reuteri. S.aureus AlsS was reported to confer resistance\nto nitrosative stress and contribute to the successful infec-\ntion of murine macrophages, and resistance ofS.aureus to\nbeta-lactam antibiotics (64). Our genomic context analy-\nsis revealed a strong association of AlsS (and AlsD) with\nRetron RTs, especially inS. aureus, suggesting a possible\nconnectionofRetronRTswiththesebiologicalprocessesin\nS.aureus.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we provided a tool for prediction, and classi-\nfication of reverse transcriptase (RT) in bacterial genomes.\nReverse transcriptases, the enzymes that convert RNA into\ncDNA, play substantial roles in different systems such as\nDiversity Generating Retroelements (DGRs), group II in-\ntrons, CRISPR-Cas systems, retrons, etc. Identification of\nthese RTs can provide us with information about the un-\nderlying interactions between phage and bacteria, archaea\nand archaeal viruses, and so forth. It can also help us to\ndetermine the origin of the RT, does it come from another\nspecies, or is it native (for instance, DGR RTs that come\nfrom phage)? Classification of RTs can also be extremely\nhelpful when it comes to biotechnological/medical appli-\ncations of certain classes of RTs, such as utilizing group II\nintrons RTs as targetron and thermotargetron, and make\nuse of retrons RTs in CRISPEY, SCRIBE and HiSCRIBE\nmethods, or as anti-phage defense systems. As RTs from\neach class have similar functions, characterization of every\nsingle RT is of importance, as it can shed light into iden-\ntification of other RTs from the same class/family. Experi-\nmentalstudiescancometorescue,andidentifythefunction\nofless-known/unknowngroupsofRTs.Thus,weprovidea\nlistofRTsineverysingleclass(known /unknown),andeven\nunclassified RTs in complete and bacterial genomes, as we\nbelieve these lists can be used by researchers in computa-\ntional and experimental fields.\nWe showed that myRT provides accurate predictions for\nmost RT classes, esp. the large classes such as GII, retron\nand DGR RTs. However, we acknowledge that smaller or\nunknown classes of RTs will be more challenging to pre-\nPAGE 11OF 13 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.5 e29\nAC\nDB\nFigure 7.Representative protein domains that are associated with RT genes of different types.

Never-\ntheless,myRTwouldbeabletopredictthoseRTs,whichcan\nbe further analyzed by using other information.\nWe expect that genomic neighborhood information can\nhelpprovideinsightsintotheputativefunctionofunknown\nclasses of RTs, including UG1-UG28, and other classes of\nRTs. Fused domains in these RTs, alongside the informa-\ntionaboutthedomainsintheflankinggenesofRTsineach\nclass,canprovideuswithsomeinsightsintothefunctionsof\nthese RTs. Also, as we collect more data for each class, this\ninformation can be used or examined by researchers. For\nexample, SLATT\n5 is frequently seen next to UG17 RTs.\nOur analyses show that 81% of RTs in complete genomes\nthat have UG17 RT, also have SLATT5 in the genomic\nneighborhood of the UG17 RT. Similarly, 76% of UG17\nRTs in draft genomes have a SLATT\n5 domain in their\nflanking genes. An example of SLATT domain next to a\nreverse transcriptase inSalmonellaenterica subsp. enterica\nserovar9,12:l,v:-str.94293ismentionedin( 62).Thisreverse\ntranscriptase shares 92% identity with WP015462025.1,\nUG17 RTs fromEdwardsiella piscicidaC07-087, which is\nmistakenly labeled as CRISPR RT in several other articles,\nyet our phylogenetic analysis showed that this RT groups\nwith UG17 RTs, it has the SLATT5 domain in its adja-\ncent neighboring gene, and importantly we couldn’t detect\nany Cas neighbors, or CRISPR systems in this reference\ngenome.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nMyRT is available to be used stand-alone ( https:\n//github.com/mgtools/myRT), and online ( https:\n//omics.informatics.indiana.edu/myRT/).

{"text": "Precise genome editing across kingdoms of life using retron-\nderived DNA\nSantiago C. Lopez1,3, Kate D. Crawford1,3, Sierra K.

However, the delivery of \nin vitro-produced DNA to target cells can be inefficient, and low abundance of template DNA \nmay underlie the low rate of precise editing. One potential tool to produce template DNA inside \ncells is a retron, a bacterial retroelement involved in phage defense. However, little effort has been \ndirected at optimizing retrons to produce designed sequences. Here, we identify modifications \nto the retron non-coding RNA that result in more abundant reverse transcribed DNA. By testing \narchitectures of the retron operon that enable efficient reverse transcription, we find that gains \nin DNA production are portable from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells and result in more efficient \ngenome editing. Finally, we show that retron RT-DNA can be used to precisely edit cultured \nhuman cells. These experiments provide a general framework to produce DNA using retrons for \ngenome modification.\nGraphical Abstract\nUsers may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, \nsubject always to the full Conditions of use: https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/accepted-manuscript-terms\n*Correspondence to: seth.shipman@gladstone.ucsf.edu.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS STATEMENT\nS.L.S., S.C.L and K.D.C conceived the study.

This DNA can serve as a template \nto modify a cell’s genome, subtly alter existing genes, or even insert wholly new genetic \nmaterial that adds function or marks a cellular event such as lineage. Exogenous DNA for \nthese uses is typically synthesized or assembled in a tube, then physically delivered to the \ncells that will be altered. However, it remains an incredible challenge to deliver exogenous \nDNA to cells in universally high abundance and without substantial variation between \nrecipients1. These technical challenges likely contribute to low rates of precise editing as \nwell as unintended editing that occurs in the absence of template DNA2–4. Effort has been \nmade to bias cells toward template-based editing by manipulating the proteins involved in \nDNA repair or tethering DNA templates to other editing materials to increase their local \nconcentration5. However, a simpler approach may be to eliminate DNA delivery problems \nby producing the DNA inside the cell.\nIn recent years, it has been shown that retroelements can be used to produce DNA \nfor genome editing within cells by reverse transcription6–9. This reverse transcribed \nDNA (RT-DNA) is produced in cells from plasmids, transgenes, or viruses, benefiting \nfrom transcriptional amplification to create high cellular concentrations that overcome \ninefficiencies in genome editing. One retroelement class that has been useful in this regard \nare bacterial retrons6,8,9, which are elements involved in phage defense10–13. Retrons are \nattractive as tools for biotechnology due to their compact size, tightly defined sites of RT \nLopez et al. Page 2\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\ninitiation and termination, lack of known host factor requirements, and lack of transposable \nelements. Indeed, retron-generated RT-DNA has demonstrated utility in bacterial6,9 and \neukaryotic8 genome editing.\nDespite the potential of the retron as component of molecular biotechnology, it has so far \nbeen modified only as little as is necessary to produce an editing template. Given that the \nadvantage of the retroelement approach is the increased cellular abundance of RT-DNA, we \nasked whether we could identify retron modifications that would yield even more abundant \nRT-DNA and increase in editing efficiency. Further, most work with retron has been carried \nout in bacteria, with only one functional demonstration of RT-DNA production in yeast8, and \nonly a brief description of reverse transcription in mammalian cells (NIH3T3 mouse cells)14. \nTherefore, we wanted to engineer a more flexible architecture for retron expression across \nkingdoms of life, to serve as a universal framework for RT-DNA production.\nHere, we used variant libraries in E. coli to show that extension of complementarity \nin the a1/a2 region of the retron non-coding RNA (ncRNA) increases production of \nRT-DNA. This effect generalized across different retrons and kingdoms, from bacteria to \nyeast. Moreover, retron DNA production across kingdoms was possible using a universal \narchitecture. We found that increasing the abundance of RT-DNA in the context of \ngenome engineering increased the rate of editing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic \ncells, simultaneously showing that the template abundance is limiting for these editing \napplications and demonstrating a simple means of increasing genome editing efficiency. \nFinally, we show that the retron RT-DNA can be used as a template for editing human cells \nto enable further gains in both future research and therapeutic ventures.\nRESULTS\nModifications to the retron ncRNA affect RT-DNA production\nA typical retron operon consists of a reverse transcriptase (RT), a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) \nthat is both the primer and template for the reverse transcriptase, and one or more accessory \nproteins15 (Fig 1a). The RT partially reverse transcribes the ncRNA to produce a single-\nstranded RT-DNA with a characteristic hairpin structure, which varies in length from 48–163 \nbases16. The ncRNA can be sub-divided into a region that is reverse transcribed (msd) and a \nregion that remains RNA in the final molecule (msr), which are partially overlapping17–20.\nOne of the first described retrons was found in E. coli, Eco1 (previously ec86)20. In BL21 \ncells, this retron is both present and active, producing RT-DNA that can be detected at the \npopulation level, which is eliminated by removing the retron operon from the genome (Fig \n1b). In the absence of this native operon, the ncRNA and RT can be expressed from a \nplasmid lacking the accessory protein, which is a minimal system for RT-DNA production. \nWe quantified this RT-DNA using qPCR. Specifically, we compared amplification from \nprimers that anneal to the msd region, which can use both the RT-DNA and plasmid as a \ntemplate, to amplification from primers that only amplify the plasmid (Fig 1c, d). In E. coli \nlacking an endogenous retron, overexpression of the ncRNA and RT from a plasmid yielded \nan ~8–10 fold enrichment of the RT-DNA/plasmid region over the plasmid alone, which is \nevidence of robust reverse transcription (Fig 1d).\nLopez et al. Page 3\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nGiven that the retron utility in biotechnology relies on increasing the RT-DNA abundance in \ncells above what can be achieved with delivery of a synthetic template, we set out to identify \naspects of the ncRNA that could be modified to produce more abundant RT-DNA. To do \nthis, we synthesized variants of the Eco1 ncRNA and cloned them into vector for expression, \nwith the RT expressed from a separate vector. Our initial library contained variants that \nextended or reduced the length of the hairpin stem of the RT-DNA. This variant cloning took \nplace in single-pot, Golden Gate reactions and the resulting libraries were purified and then \ncloned into an expression strain for analysis of RT-DNA production (Fig 1e). Cells harboring \nthese library vector sets were grown overnight and then diluted and ncRNA expression was \ninduced during growth for 5 hours.\nWe quantified the relative abundance of each variant plasmid in the expression strain \nby multiplexed Illumina sequencing before and after expression. After expression, we \nadditionally purified RT-DNA from pools of cells harboring different retron variants by \nisolating cellular nucleic acids, treating that population with an RNase mixture (A/T1), \nand then isolating single-stranded DNA from double-stranded DNA using a commercial \ncolumn-based kit. We then sequenced the RT-DNAs, comparing their relative abundance to \nthat of their plasmid of origin to quantify the influence of different ncRNA parameters on \nRT-DNA production. To sequence the RT-DNA variants in this library, we used a custom \nsequencing pipeline to prep each RT-DNA without biasing toward any variant. This involved \ntailing purified RT-DNA with a string of polynucleotides using a template-independent \npolymerase (TdT), and then generating a complementary strand via an adapter-containing, \ninverse anchored primer. Finally, we ligated a second adapter to this double-stranded DNA \nand proceed to indexing and multiplexed sequencing (Extended Data Fig 1a, b).\nIn this first library, we modified the msd stem length from 0–31 base pairs, and found that \nstem length can have a large impact on RT-DNA production (Fig 2a). The RT tolerated \nmodifications of the msd stem length that deviate by a small amount from the wild-type (wt) \nlength of 25 base pairs. However, variants with stem lengths <12 and >30 produced less than \nhalf as much RT-DNA compared to the wt. Therefore, we used stem length of between 12 \nand 30 base pairs going forward.\nIn a second library, we investigated the effect of increasing the loop length at the top of \nwhat becomes the RT-DNA stem (Fig 2b). To do this, we created five random sequences \nof 70 bases each. We then synthesized variant ncRNAs incorporating 5–70 of these bases \ninto the msd top loop. Thus, we tested five versions of each loop length, each with different \nbase content, and then averaged each variant’s RT-DNA production at every loop length. We \ndid not include the wt loop in this library, so we normalized RT-DNA production to the 5 \nbase loops, which are closest in size to the wt length of 4 bases. We found a substantial \ndecline in RT-DNA production as loop length increases from 5 to ~14 bases, but almost no \ncontinued decline beyond that point, other than a single point at 28 bases which inexplicably \nproduced more RT-DNA than its neighboring loops. While we were limited by our synthesis \nand sequencing parameters to 70 bases, our conclusion is that loops shorter than 14 bases \nare ideal for RT-DNA production; however, loops that extend beyond 14 bases do not \nadditionally reduce RT-DNA production.\nLopez et al. Page 4\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nThe other parameter we investigated was the length of a1/a2 complementarity, a region of \nthe ncRNA structure where the 5’ and 3’ ends of the ncRNA fold back upon themselves, \nand which we hypothesized plays a role in initiating reverse transcription (Fig 2c). Because \nthis region of the ncRNA is not reverse transcribed, we could not sequence the variants in \nthe RT-DNA population directly. Instead, we introduced a nine-base barcode in an extended \nloop of the msd that we could sequence as a proxy for the modification (Fig 2d). We \namplified these barcodes directly from the purified RT-DNA for sequencing (Fig 2e) or \nprepped the RT-DNA using the TdT extension method described above (Extended Data Fig \n1c). In both cases, we found a similar effect: reducing the length of complementarity in this \nregion below seven base pairs substantially impaired RT-DNA production, consistent with a \ncritical role in reverse transcription (Fig 2f). However, extending the a1/a2 length resulted \nin increased production of RT-DNA relative to the wt length. Importantly, this is the first \nmodification to a retron ncRNA that has been shown to increase RT-DNA production.\nRT-DNA production in eukaryotic cells\nWe next wondered whether the increased production by the extended a1/a2 region \nwould be a portable modification, both other retrons and to eukaryotic systems. To \nfacilitate expression of Eco1 in eukaryotic cells, we inverted the operon from its native \narrangement21. In the endogenous arrangement, the ncRNA is in the 5’ UTR of the RT \ntranscript, requiring internal ribosome entry for the RT from an RBS that is contained \nin or near the a2 region of the ncRNA. In eukaryotic cells, this arrangement puts the \nentire ncRNA between the 5’ mRNA cap and the initiation codon for the RT. This \nincreased distance between the cap and initiation codon, as well as the ncRNA structure and \nout-of-frame ATG codons, is expected to negatively affect RT translation21,22. Moreover, \naltering the a1/a2 region in the native arrangement could have unintended effects on the RT \ntranslation. In the inverted architecture, the RT is driven by a pol II promoter directly with \nits initiation codon near the 5’ end of the transcript and the ncRNA in the 3’ UTR, where \nvariations are unlikely to influence RT translation (Fig 3a).\nWe first tested this arrangement for Eco1 in S. cerevisiae, by placing the RT – ncRNA \ncassette under the expression of Galactose inducible promoter, on a single-copy plasmid. \nWe detected RT-DNA production using a qPCR assay analogous to that described for E. \ncoli above, comparing amplification from primers that could use the plasmid or RT-DNA \nas a template to amplification from primers that could anneal only to the plasmid. Here, \nwe found that increasing the length of the Eco1 a1/a2 region from 12 to 27 base pairs \nresulted in more abundant RT-DNA production (Fig 3b, Extended Data Fig 2a). We then \nextended this analysis to another retron, Eco219. We found a similar effect: though the wt \nncRNA produced detectable RT-DNA, a version extending the a1/a2 region from 13 to 29 \nbase pairs produced significantly more RT-DNA (Fig 3c, Extended Data Fig 2a). In each \ncase, we compared induced to uninduced cells, which likely under-reports the total RT-DNA \nabundance if there is any transcriptional ‘leak’ from the plasmid in the absence of inducers. \nIndeed, we detected RT-DNA production in the uninduced condition relative to a control \nexpressing a catalytically dead RT, indicating some transcriptional ‘leak’ (Extended Data Fig \n2b).\nLopez et al. Page 5\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nWe then moved from yeast to cultured human cells, HEK293T. Using a similar gene \narchitecture to yeast, but with a genome-integrating cassette (Fig 3d), we found that Eco1 \ndoes not produce significant abundance of RT-DNA in human cells that we could detect \nby qPCR, regardless of a1/a2 length (Fig 3e), from a tightly regulated promoter (Extended \nData Fig 2c). In contrast, Eco2 produces detectable RT-DNA, with both a wt and extended \na1/a2 region (Fig 3f). In human cells, however, the introduction of an extended a1/a2 region \ndiminishes, rather than enhances, production of RT-DNA. Nevertheless, this demonstrates \nRT-DNA production by a retron in human cells.\nImprovements extend to applications in genome editing\nIn prokaryotes, retron-derived RT-DNA can be used as a template for recombineering6,9. \nThe retron ncRNA is modified to include a long loop in the msd that contains homology to \na genomic locus along with one or more nucleotide modifications (Fig 4a). When RT-DNA \nfrom this modified ncRNA is produced along with a single stranded annealing protein \n(SSAP; e.g., lambda Redβ), the RT-DNA is incorporated into the lagging strand during \ngenome replication, thereby editing the genome of half of the cell progeny. This process \nis typically carried out in modified bacterial strains with numerous nucleases and repair \nproteins knocked out, because editing occurs at a low rate in wt cells9. Therefore, we asked \nwhether increasing RT-DNA abundance using retrons with extended a1/a2 regions could \nincrease the rate of editing in relatively unmodified strains.\nWe produced RT-DNA to edit a single nucleotide in the rpoB gene. We designed the \nretron using the same flexible architecture that we used for both the yeast and mammalian \nexpression, with the ncRNA in the 3’ UTR of the RT. We used a 12 base stem for the \nmsd, which retains near-wt RT-DNA production. We constructed two versions of the editing \nretron, one with the wt 12-base a1/a2 region and another with an extended 22-base a1/a2 \nlength. Using qPCR and PAGE analysis, we confirmed that the extended a1/a2 version \nproduced more abundant RT-DNA (Fig 4b, c). Finally, we expressed each version of \nthe ncRNA along with CspRecT, a high-efficiency SSAP23, and mutL E32K, a dominant-\nnegative mutL that eliminates mismatch repair at sites of single-base mismatch24,25 in \nBL21-AI cells that were unmodified, other than the removal of the endogenous Eco1 retron \noperon. Both ncRNAs resulted in appreciable editing after a single 16h overnight expression, \nbut the extended version was significantly more effective (Fig 4d). To test whether the \neffect of the a1/a2 extension was locus-specific or generalized across genomic sites, we \ntested an additional three loci26 for precise editing. We found that the engineered retron \nmediated editing at each additional loci, and that the efficiency of editing was improved by \nthe a1/a2 extension at all three additional sites (Extended Data Fig 3). This shows that the \nabundance of the RT-DNA template for recombineering is a limiting factor for editing, and \nthat modified ncRNA can be used to introduce edits at a higher rate.\nRetron-derived RT-DNA can also be used to edit eukaryotic cells8. Specifically, in yeast, \nthe ncRNA is modified to contain homology to a genomic locus and to add one or \nmore nucleotide modifications in the loop of the msd, similar to the prokaryotic template. \nHowever, in this version, the ncRNA is on a transcript that also includes an SpCas9 gRNA \nand scaffold. When these components are expressed along with RT and SpCas9, the genomic \nLopez et al. Page 6\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nsite is cut and repaired precisely using the RT-DNA as a template (Fig 4e). We tested our \nmodified ncRNAs, using an architecture that was otherwise unchanged from a previously \ndescribed version8. The ncRNA/gRNA transcript was expressed from a Galactose inducible \npromoter on a single-copy plasmid, flanked by ribozymes. Along with the plasmid-encoded \nncRNA/gRNA, we expressed either Eco1 RT, Cas9, both the RT and Cas9, or neither, from \nGalactose inducible cassettes integrated into the genome. The ncRNA/gRNA was designed \nto target and edit the ADE2 locus, resulting in both a two-nucleotide modification and a \ncellular phenotype, pink colonies.\nUsing the ncRNA with a 12-base a1/a2 length, we found that the expression of both the RT \nand Cas9 was necessary for editing based on pink colony counts, with only a small amount \nof background editing when we expressed Cas9 alone (Fig 4f, g). This is consistent with \nthe reverse transcription of the ncRNA being required, rather than having the edit arise from \nthe plasmid as donor. To test the effect of extending the a1/a2 region on genome editing \nefficiency, we designed two versions of the a1/a2 extended forms, both of which had a \nlength of 27 base pairs, but differed in their a1/a2 sequence. We found that both versions \noutperformed the standard 12 base form for precise genome editing (Fig 4f, g). Consistent \nwith our results in E. coli, this indicates that RT-DNA production is a limiting factor for \nprecise genome editing, and that extended a1/a2 length is a generalizable modification that \nenhances retron-based genome engineering. We further confirmed these phenotypic results \nby sequencing the ADE2 locus from batch cultures of cells (Fig 4h). Precise modifications \nof the site, resulting from edits that use the RT-DNA as a template, follow the same pattern \nas the phenotypic results, showing editing that depends on both the Cas9 nuclease and RT, \nand is increased by extension of the a1/a2 region.\nWe also found that the rates of precise editing determined by sequencing from batch cultures \nwere consistently lower than those estimated from counting colonies. This is likely due to \nadditional editing that continues to occur on the plate before counting, and our method of \ncounting colonies as pink even if they were only partially pink. Another source of pink \ncolonies could be any imprecise edits to the site that result in a non-functional ADE2 \ngene. Indeed, we observed some ADE2 loci that matched neither the wt nor precisely \nedited sequence. These occurred at a low rate (~1–3%) in all conditions, which was \nslightly elevated by Cas9 expression, but unaffected by RT expression/RT-DNA production \n(Extended Data Fig 4a). This, as well as the pattern of insertions, deletions, transitions, \nand transversions is consistent with a combination of sequencing errors and Cas9-produced \nindels (Extended Data Fig 4b, c).\nAs in the bacterial experiments, we tested whether the extended a1/a2 modification was \na generalizable improvement by targeting additional loci across the genome. To this end, \nwe generated wt and extended a1/a2 retrons to edit four additional loci27 in yeast (TRP2, \nFAA1, CAN1, and LYP1). We found that for three out of four additional loci, the extended \na1/a2 retrons yielded higher rates of precise editing, whereas one site showed lower, but still \nsubstantial rates of editing with the extended version (Extended Data Fig 5). Overall, across \nthe nine sites tested in bacteria and yeast, the a1/a2 extension improved editing rates at eight \nsites.\nLopez et al. Page 7\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nPrecise editing by retrons extends to human cells\nFinally, we set out to test whether retron-produced RT-DNA could be used to for precise \nediting of human cells, as a step toward future therapeutic applications, as well as research \napplications seeking to unravel the mechanisms of genetic disease. Porting the editing \nmachinery to cultured human cells required some additional modifications. In yeast, we \nproduced both Cas9 and the retron RT from separate promoters. In human cells, expressing \nboth of these proteins from a single promoter would greatly simplify the system and \nincrease its portability. To identify an optimal single promoter architecture, we tested six \narrangements in yeast: four fusion proteins using two different linker sequences with both \norientations of Cas9 and Eco1 RT; and two versions where Cas9 and Eco1 RT were \nseparated by a P2A28 sequence in both possible orientations. These constructs were co-\nexpressed with the best performing ADE2 editing ncRNA/gRNA construct described above \n(extended v1, a1/a2 length 27 bp). We found that expression of these constructs resulted \nin a range of precise editing rates, with the Cas9-P2A-RT version yielding editing rates \ncomparable to our previous versions based on two promoters (Fig 5a).\nWe then created two HEK293T cell lines that each harbored one of two integrating cassettes: \nCas9 alone or Cas9-P2A-Eco1 RT (Fig 5b). We initially tested precise genome editing using \na pol II driven ncRNA/gRNA flanked by ribozymes, as we had in yeast. However, we found \nno evidence of either precise editing or indels, consistent with previous reports of inefficient \nribozyme-mediated gRNA release in human cells29. Therefore, we changed the expression \nof our retron ncRNA/gRNA to be driven by a pol III H1 promoter, carried on a transiently \ntransfected plasmid (Fig 5b). Six genomic loci (HEK3, RNF2, EMX1, FANCF, HEK47, and \nAA VS130) were selected for editing, and an ncRNA/gRNA plasmid aiming to target and edit \nthe site was generated.\nThe repair template was designed to introduce two distinct mutations, separated by at least \n2 bp: the first introduced a single nucleotide change near the cut-site; the second recoded \nthe PAM nucleotides (NGG → NHH, H: non-G nucleotide). The reasoning for this was \ntwo-fold: first, the multiple changes should both eliminate Cas9 cutting of the ncRNA/RT \nplasmid and re-cutting of the precisely recoded site; and second, these multiple, separated \nchanges make it much less likely to mistakenly assign a Cas9-induced indel as a precise \nedit. As a technical aside, we would recommend against using single-base modifications \nto benchmark Cas9-induced precise editing applications as they are a common outcome of \nimprecise repair and can easily lead to inaccurate estimates of editing rate. We induced \nexpression of the protein(s) for 24 hours, then transfected the ncRNA/gRNA plasmids, and \nsubsequently harvested cells 3 days after transfection. Using targeted Illumina sequencing, \nwe found precise editing of each site in the presence of the RT, well above the background \nrate of editing in the absence of the RT (Fig 5c–h). We believe that the small percentage \nof precise edits in the absence of the RT likely represents use of the plasmid as a repair \ntemplate, and the gain in the editing rate in the presence of the RT indicates edits using \nRT-DNA as the template. Interestingly, we see that the rates of imprecise edits (indels) \ndecline in the presence of the RT by roughly the same magnitude as the precise edits \nthemselves, suggesting that the RT-DNA is being used to precisely edit sites that would have \notherwise been edited imprecisely (Extended Data Figure 6).\nLopez et al.

Our results yield a generalizable framework for retron RT-DNA \nproduction. Specifically, we show that a minimal stem length must be maintained in the msd \nto yield abundant RT-DNA and that the msd loop length affects RT-DNA production. We \nalso show that there is a minimum length for the a1/a2 complementary region. Perhaps most \nimportantly, we demonstrate that the a1/a2 region can be extended beyond its wt length to \nproduce more abundant RT-DNA, and that increasing template abundance in both bacteria \nand yeast increases editing efficiency.\nImportantly, these modifications are portable, both across retrons and across species. The \nextended a1/a2 region produces more RT-DNA using Eco1 in bacteria and both Eco1 and \nEco2 in yeast. Oddly, the extended a1/a2 region did not increase RT-DNA production in \ncultured human cells. Further work will be necessary to optimize RT-DNA production in \nhuman cells specifically. Nonetheless, we provide a clear demonstration of retron-produced \nRT-DNA in human cells.\nRetrons have been used to produce DNA templates for genome engineering6,8,9, driven \nby the rationale that an intracellularly produced template eliminates the issues related to \nexogenous template delivery and availability. However, there have been no investigations of \nwhether the RT-DNA templates are abundant enough to saturate the editing, or if even more \ntemplate would lead to higher rates of editing. Our results establish that editing template \nabundance is limiting for genome editing in both bacteria and yeast, because extension of \nthe a1/a2 region, which increases the abundance of the RT-DNA, also increases editing \nefficiency.\nAdditionally, the inverted arrangement of the retron operon, with the ncRNA in the 3’ UTR \nof the RT transcript, was found to produce RT-DNA in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian \ncells. This is the first time that a single, unifying retron architecture has been shown to be \ncompatible with all of these host systems, simplifying comparisons and portability across \nkingdoms.\nWe also show, consistent with contemporaneous studies31, that the retron RT-DNA can be \nused as a template to precisely edit human cells. Further, our repair template design allows \nus to confidently call the precise editing rates. Importantly, we have also applied the same \nanalysis to the Cas9 only conditions and reported the precise editing rates therein, and \nrecommend that this approach be applied in future work. We believe that this will allow for \nestimations of the proportion of precise editing attributable to nuclease-only activity, and \nultimately aid us in obtaining more realistic estimates of the precise editing rates attributable \nto the genome engineering tool of interest.\nOne major difference between the two eukaryotic systems (yeast/human) is the ratio of \nprecise to imprecise editing. Yeast RT-DNA-based editing occurs at a ratio of ~74:1 precise \nedits to imprecise edits, while human editing inverted at a ratio of ~1:15 precise edits to \nimprecise edits. Whether this is a result of differences in repair pathways, or the substantial \ndifference in the abundance of retron-produced RT-DNA between yeast and human cells that \nLopez et al.

In summary, this work represents an important advance in the versatile use of \nretron in vivo DNA synthesis and RT-DNA for genome editing across kingdoms.\nMETHODS\nAll biological replicates were collected from distinct samples and not the same sample \nmeasured repeatedly. Full statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 4.\nConstructs and Strains\nFor bacterial expression, a plasmid encoding the Eco1 ncRNA and RT in that order from \na T7 promoter (pSLS.436) was constructed by amplifying the retron elements from the \nBL21-AI genome and using Gibson assembly for integration into a backbone based on \npRSFDUET1. The Eco1 RT was cloned separately into the erythromycin-inducible vector \npJKR-O-mphR32 to generate pSLS.402. Eco1 ncRNA variants were cloned behind a T7/lac \npromoter in a vector based on pRSFDUET-1 with BsaI sites removed to facilitate Golden \nGate cloning (pSLS.601), described further below. Eco1 RTs along with recombineering \nncRNAs driven by T7/lac promoters (pSLS.491 and pSLS.492) were synthesized by Twist in \npET-21(+).\nBacterial experiments were carried out in BL21-AI cells, or a derivative of BL21-AI cells. \nThese cells harbor a T7 polymerase driven by a ParaB, arabinose-inducible, promoter. A \nknockout strain for the Eco1 operon (bSLS.114) was constructed from BL21-AI cells, using \na strategy based on Datsenko and Wanner (2000)33 to replace the retron operon with an \nFRT-flanked chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The replacement cassette was amplified \nfrom pKD3, adding homology arms to the Eco1 locus. This amplicon was electroporated \ninto BL21-AI cells expressing lambda Red genes from pKD46 and clones were isolated \nby selection on 10μg/ml strength chloramphenicol plates. After genotyping to confirm locus-\nspecific insertion, the chloramphenicol cassette was excised by transient expression of FLP \nrecombinase to leave only a FRT scar.\nFor yeast expression, four sets of plasmids were generated. The first set of \nplasmids, designed to express the protein components for yeast genome editing, \nwere based off of pZS.1578, a HIS3 yeast integrating plasmid for Galactose \ninducible Eco1RT and Cas9 expression (Gal1-10 promoter). A first set of variants \nof pZS.157, designed to compare the effect of wt vs. extended a1/a2 region lengths \non genome editing were generated by PCR, and express either an empty cassette \n(pSCL.004), only Cas9 (pSCL.005), only the Eco1RT (pSCL.006), or both (pZS.157). \nA second set of variants was generated to test single-promoter expression of Cas9-\nEco1RT variants. We designed 6 of such plasmids: Eco1RT-linker1-Cas9 (pSCL.71); \nCas9-linker1-Eco1RT (pSCL.72); Eco1RT-linker2-Cas9 (pSCL.94); Cas9-linker2-Eco1RT \n(pSCL.95); Eco1RT-P2A-Cas9 (pSCL.102), and Cas9-P2A-Eco1RT (pSCL.103). \nThe intervening sequences used were: Linker1 (GGTSSGGSGTAGSSGATSGG); \nLinker2 (SGGSSGGSSGSETPGTSESATPESSGGSSGGSS)7; and P2A \n(ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP)28.\nLopez et al. Page 10\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nThe second set of plasmids built for the genome editing experiments are based off of \npZS.1658, a URA3+ centromere plasmid for Galactose (Gal7) inducible expression of a \nmodified Eco1 retron ncRNA, which consists of an Eco1 msr -ADE2-targetting gRNA \nchimera, flanked by HH-HDV ribozymes. An initial variant of pZS.165 was generated by \ncloning an IDT-synthesized gBlock consisting of an Eco1 ncRNA (a1/a2 length: 12bp), \nwhich, when reverse transcribed, encodes a 200bp Ade2 repair template to introduce a stop \ncodon (P272X) into the ADE2 gene (pSCL.002). Two additional plasmids were generated to \nextend the a1/a2 region of the Eco1 ncRNA to 27bp, with variations in the a1/a2 sequence \n(pSCL.039 and pSCL.040).\nThe third set of plasmids was built to assess the generalizability of the extended a1/a2 \nmodification. The plasmids carrying wt length a1/a2 retrons are based off of pSCL.002, \nwhere the Ade2-targeting gRNA and Ade2-editing msd were replaced with analogous \nsequences to target and insert the following mutations: Can1 G444X (pSCL.106); Lyp1 \nE27X (pSCL.108); Trp2 E64X (pSCL.110); and Faa1 P233X (pSCL.112). The plasmids \ncarrying extended length a1/a2 retrons are based off of pSCL.039, and were generated \nsimilarly to the wt length a1/a2 retron-encoding plasmids: Can1 G444X (pSCL.107); Lyp1 \nE27X (pSCL.109); Trp2 E64X (pSCL.111); and Faa1 P233X (pSCL.113).\nThe last set of plasmids, designed to compare the levels of RT-DNA production by the \ndifferent retron systems, were derived from pSCL.002. IDT-synthesized gBlocks encoding \na mammalian codon-optimized Eco1RT and ncRNA (wt), a dead Eco1RT and ncRNA (wt), \nand a human codon-optimized Eco2RT and ncRNA (wt), were cloned into pSCL.002 by \nGibson Assembly, generating pSCL.027, pSCL.031 and pSCL.017, respectively. pSCL.027 \nwas used to generate pSCL.028 by PCR, which carries a mammalian codon optimized \nEco1RT and ncRNA (extended a1/a2: 27bp). Similarly, pSC.0L17 was used to generate \npSCL.034 by PCR, which carries a mammalian codon optimized Eco2RT and ncRNA \n(extended a1/a2: 29bp).\nAll yeast strains were created by LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG transformation34 of BY474235. \nStrains for evaluating the genome editing efficiency of various retron ncRNAs were created \nby BY4742 integration of plasmids pZS.157, pSCL.004, pSCL.005 or pSCL.006 using \nKpnI-linearized plasmids for homologous recombination into the HIS3 locus. Transformants \nwere isolated on SC-HIS plates. To evaluate effect of the length of the Eco1 ncRNA \na1/a2 region on genome editing efficiency, these parental strains were transformed with \nepisomal plasmids carrying the different retron ncRNA cassettes (pSCL.002, pSCL.039, \nor pSCL.040), and double transformants were isolated on SC-HIS-URA plates. The result \nwas a set of control strains which were lacking one or both components of the genome \nediting machinery (i.e. Eco1RT, Cas9), and 3 strains which had all components necessary for \nretron-mediated genome editing but differed in the length of the Eco1 ncRNA a1/a2 region \n(12bp vs. 27bp).\nStrains designed to assess the generalizability of the extended a1/a2 modification were \ncreated by transformation of a HIS3:pZS.157 yeast strain with plasmids carrying either \nwt or extended a1/a2 retrons for the editing of the four additional loci. Transformants \nwere isolated on SC-HIS-URA plates. Strains to test single-promoter expression of Cas9-\nLopez et al. Page 11\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nEco1RT variants were created by BY4742 integration of plasmids pSCL.71, pSCL.72, \npSCL.94, pSCL.95, pSCL.102 or pSCL.103 using KpnI-linearized plasmids for homologous \nrecombination into the HIS3 locus. Transformants were isolated on SC-HIS plates. These \nstrains were then transformed with pSCL.39, and transformants isolated on SC-HIS-URA \nplates.\nStrains designed to compare the levels of RT-DNA production by the different retron \nconstructs were created by transformation of plasmids pSCL.027, pSCL.037 and pSCL.028 \nfor Eco1 (wt, wt dead RT, and extended a1/a2, respectively) into BY4742; pSCL.017 and \npSCL.031 for Eco2 (wt, and extended a1/a2, respectively) into BY4742. Transformants were \nisolated by plating on SC-URA agar plates. Expression of proteins and ncRNAs from all \nyeast strains was performed in liquid SC-Ura 2% Galactose media for 24h, unless specified.\nFor mammalian retron expression and quantification of RT-DNA production, synthesized \ngBlocks encoding human codon optimized Eco1 and Eco2 were cloned into a PiggyBac-\nintegrating plasmid for doxycycline-inducible human protein expression (TetOn-3G \npromoter). Eco1 variants are wt retron-Eco1 RT and ncRNA (pKDC.018, with a1/a2 length: \n12bp), extended a1/a2 length ncRNA (pKDC.019, with a1/a2 length: 27 bp), and a dead \n-Eco1 RT control (pKDC.020, with a1/a2 length: 27 bp). Eco2 variants were wt retron-\nEco2 RT and ncRNA (pKDC.015, with a1/a2 length: 13bp), extended a1/a2 length ncRNA \n(pKDC.031, with a1/a2 length: 29 bp).\nStable mammalian cell lines for assessing RT-DNA production by wt and extended a1/a2 \nregions were created using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection protocol (Invitrogen) and a \nPiggyBac transposase system. T25s of 50–70% confluent HEK293T cells were transfected \nusing 8.3 ug of retron expression plasmids (pKDC.015, pKDC.018, pKDC.019, pKDC.020, \nor pKDC.031) and 4.2 ug PiggyBac transposase plasmid (pCMV-hyPBase). Stable cell lines \nwere selected with puromycin.\nFor assessment of retron-mediated precise genome editing in mammalian cells, two sets \nof plasmids were generated. The first set of plasmids, carrying either the SpCas9 gene \nor the SpCas9-P2A-Eco1RT construct, was built by restriction cloning of the respective \ngenes, PCR amplified off of the aforementioned yeast vectors, into a PiggyBac-integrating \nplasmid for doxycycline-inducible human protein expression (TetOn-3G promoter). The \nsecond set of plasmids carries the ncRNA/gRNA targeting one of six loci in the human \ngenome: HEK3 (pSCL.175); RNF2 (pSCL.176); EMX1 (pSCL.177); FANCF (pSCL.178); \nHEK4 (pSCL.179); and AA VS1 (pSCL.180). These were generated by restriction cloning \nof the ncRNA/gRNA cassette, built by primer assembly36, into an H1 expression plasmid \n(FHUGW).\nThe ncRNA/gRNA cassette was designed as follows. The msd contains a repair template-\nencoding, 120bp sequence in its loop. The plasmid-encoded repair template is slightly \nasymmetric (49 bp of genome site homology upstream of Cas9 cut site; 71 bp of genome \nsite homology downstream of cut site), and is complementary to the target strand – \nin practice, this means that after reverse transcription, the repair template RT-DNA is \ncomplementary to the non-target strand, as recommended in previous studies37. The repair \nLopez et al. Page 12\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\ntemplate carries two distinct mutations: the first introduces a 1bp SNP at the Cas9 cut site; \nthe second, designed to be at least 2bp away from the first mutation, recodes the Cas9 PAM \n(NGG → NHH, where H is any nucleotide beside G). The gRNA is 20bp.\nStable mammalian cell lines for assessing retron-mediated precise genome editing were \ncreated using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection protocol (Invitrogen) and a PiggyBac \ntransposase system. T25s of 50–70% confluent HEK293T cells were transfected using \n8.3 ug of protein expression plasmids (pSCL.139 and pSCL.140) and 4.2 ug PiggyBac \ntransposase plasmid (pCMV-hyPBase). Stable cell lines were selected with puromycin.\nPlasmids and strains are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Primers used to generate \nand verify strains are listed in Supplementary Table 3. All plasmids will be made available \non Addgene at the time of peer-reviewed publication.\nqPCR\nqPCR analysis of RT-DNA was carried out by comparing amplification from samples using \ntwo sets of primers. One set could only use the plasmid as a template because they bound \noutside the msd region (outside) and the other set could use either the plasmid or RT-DNA \nas a template because they bound inside the msd region (inside). Results were analyzed by \nfirst taking the difference in cycle threshold (CT) between the inside and outside primer \nsets for each biological replicate. Next, each biological replicate ΔCT was subtracted from \nthe average ΔCT of the control condition (e.g. uninduced). Fold change was calculated as \n2−ΔΔCT for each biological replicate. This fold change represents the difference in abundance \nof the inside versus outside template, where the presence of RT-DNA leads to fold change \nvalues >1.\nFor the initial analysis of Eco1 RT-DNA when overexpressed in E. coli, the qPCR analysis \nused just three primers, two of which bound inside the msd and one which bound outside. \nThe inside PCR was generated using both inside primers, while the outside PCR used one \ninside and one outside primer. For all other experiments, four primers were used. Two bound \ninside the msd and two bound outside the msd in the RT. qPCR primers are all listed in \nSupplementary Table 3.\nFor bacterial experiments, constructs were expressed in liquid culture, shaking at 37C for \n6–16 hours after which a volume of 25ul of culture was harvested, mixed with 25ul H2O, \nand incubated at 95C for 5 minutes. A volume of 0.3ul of this boiled culture was used as a \ntemplate in 30ul reactions using a KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR mix.\nFor yeast experiments, single colonies were inoculated into SC-URA 2% Glucose and grown \nshaking overnight at 30C. To express the constructs, the overnight cultures were spun down, \nwashed and resuspended in 1mL of water and passaged at a 1:30 dilution into SC-URA \n2% Galactose, grown shaking for 24h at 30C. 250ul aliquots of the uninduced and induced \ncultures were collected for qPCR analysis. For qPCR sample preparation, the aliquots were \nspun down, resuspended in 50ul of water, and incubated at 100C for 15 minutes. The \nsamples were then briefly spun down, placed on ice to cool, and 50ul of the supernatant was \ntreated with Proteinase K by combining it with 29ul of water, 9ul of CutSmart buffer and 2ul \nLopez et al. Page 13\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nof Proteinase K (NEB), followed by incubation at 56C for 30 minutes. The Proteinase K was \ninactivated by incubation at 95C for 10 minutes, followed by a 1.5-minute centrifugation \nat maximum speed (~21,000 g). The supernatant was collected and used as a template for \nqPCR reactions, consisting of 2.5ul of template in 10ul KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR reactions.\nFor mammalian experiments, retron expression in stable HEK293T cell lines was induced \nusing 1 ug/mL doxycycline for 24h at 37C in 6-well plates. 1ml aliquots of induced and \nuninduced cell lines were collected for qPCR analysis. qPCR sample preparation and \nreaction mix followed the yeast experimental protocol.\nRT-DNA purification and PAGE analysis\nTo analyze RT-DNA on a PAGE gel after expression in E. coli, 2ml of culture were pelleted \nand nucleotides were prepared using a Qiagen mini prep protocol, substituting Epoch mini \nspin columns and buffers MX2 and MX3 for Qiagen components. Purified DNA was then \ntreated with additional RNaseA/T1 mix (NEB) for 30 minutes at 37C and then single \nstranded DNA was isolated from the prep using an ssDNA/RNA Clean & Concentrator kit \nfrom Zymo Research. The purified RT-DNA was then analyzed on 10% Novex TBE-Urea \nGels (Invitrogen), with a 1X TBE running buffer that was heated >80C before loading. Gels \nwere stained with Sybr Gold (Thermo Fisher) and imaged on a Gel Doc imager (Bio-Rad).\nTo analyze RT-DNA on a PAGE gel after expression in S. cerevisiae, 5ml of overnight \nculture in SC-URA 2% Galactose was pelleted and RT-DNA was isolated by RNAse A/T1 \ntreatment of the aqueous (RNA) phase after TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen), following the \nmanufacturer’s recommendations with few modifications, as noted here. Cell pellets were \nresuspended in 500ul of RNA lysis buffer (100 mM EDTA pH8, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, \n2% SDS) and incubated for 20 minutes at 85C, prior to the addition of the TRIzol reagent. \nThe aqueous phase was chloroform-extracted twice. Following isopropanol precipitation, the \nRNA + RT-DNA pellet was resuspended in 265ul of TE and treated with 5ul of RNAse \nA/T1 + 30ul NEB2 buffer. The mixture was incubated for 25 minutes at 37C, after which \nthe RT-DNA was re-precipitated by addition of equal volumes of isopropanol. The resulting \nRT-DNA was analyzed on Novex 10% TBE-Urea gels as described above.\nVariant library cloning\nEco1 ncRNA variant parts were synthesized by Agilent. Variant parts were flanked by BsaI \ntype IIS cut sites and specific primers that allowed amplification of the sublibraries from a \nlarger synthesis run. Random nucleotides were appended to the 3’ end of synthesized parts \nso that all sequences were the same length (150 bases). The vector to accept these parts \n(pSLS.601) was amplified with primers that also added BsaI sites, so that the ncRNA variant \namplicons and amplified vector backbone could be combined into a Golden Gate reaction \nusing BsaI-HFv2 and T4 ligase to generate a pool of variant plasmids at high efficiency \nwhen electroporated into a cloning strain. Variant libraries were miniprepped from the \ncloning strain and electroporated into the expression strain. Primers for library construction \nare listed in Supplementary Table 3. Variant parts are listed in Supplementary Data Set 1.\nLopez et al. Page 14\nNat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 June 23.\nAuthor Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\nVariant library expression and analysis\nEco1 ncRNA variant libraries were grown overnight and then diluted 1:500 for expression. \nA sample of the culture pre-expression was taken to quantify the variant plasmid library, \nmixed 1:1 with H2O and incubated at 95C for 5 minutes and then frozen at −20C. \nConstructs were expressed (arabinose and IPTG for the ncRNA, erythromycin for the RT) \nas the cells grew shaking at 37C for 5 hours, after which time two samples were collected. \nOne was collected to quantify the variant plasmid library. That sample was mixed 1:1 \nwith H2O and incubated at 95C for 5 minutes and then frozen at −20C, identically to \nthe pre-expression sample. The other sample was collected to sequence the RT-DNA. That \nsample was prepared as described above for RT-DNA purification.\nThe two variant plasmid library samples (boiled cultures) taken before and after expression \nwere amplified by PCR using primers flanking the ncRNA region that also contained \nadapters for Illumina sequencing preparation. The purified RT-DNA was prepared for \nsequencing by first treating with DBR1 (OriGene) to remove the branched RNA, then \nextending the 3’ end with a single nucleotide, dCTP, in a reaction with terminal \ndeoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This reaction was carried out in the absence of cobalt \nfor 120 seconds at room temperature with the aim of adding only 5–10 cytosines before \ninactivating the TdT at 70C. A second complementary strand was then created from \nthat extended product using Klenow Fragment (3’→5’ exo-) with a primer containing an \nIllumina adapter sequence, six guanines, and a non-guanine (H) anchor. Finally, Illumina \nadapters were ligated on at the 3’ end of the complementary strand using T4 ligase. In \none variation, the loop of the RT-DNA for the a1/a2 library was amplified using Illumina \nadapter-containing primers in the RT-DNA, but outside the variable region from the purified \nRT-DNA directly. All products were indexed and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Primers \nused for sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table 3.\nPython software was custom written to extract variant counts from each plasmid and RT-\nDNA sample. In each case, these counts were then converted to a percentage of each library, \nor relative abundance (e.g., raw count for a variant over total counts for all variants). The \nrelative abundance of a given variant in the RT-DNA sample was then divided by the relative \nabundance of that same variant in the plasmid library, using the average of the pre- and \npost-induction values, to control for differences in the abundance of each variant plasmid \nin the expression strain. Finally, these corrected abundance values were normalized to the \naverage corrected abundance of the wt variant (set to 100%) or the loop length of 5 (set to \n100%).\nRecombineering expression and analysis\nIn experiments using the retron ncRNA to edit bacterial genomes, the retron cassette was \nco-expressed with CspRecT and mutL E32K from the plasmid pORTMAGE-Ec123 for 16 \nhours, shaking at 37C. After expression, a volume of 25ul of culture was harvested, mixed \nwith 25ul H2O, and incubated at 95C for 5 minutes. A volume of 0.3ul of this boiled \nculture was used as a template in 30ul reactions with primers flanking the edit site, which \nadditionally contained adapters for Illumina sequencing preparation. These amplicons were \nLopez et al. Page 15\nNat Chem Biol.

Cultures were passaged twice into SC-URA 2% Galactose \n(1:30 dilutions) for 24 hours, for a total of 48 hours of editing. At each timepoint (after \n24h Raffinose, 24h Galactose, 48h Galactose), an aliquot of the cultures was harvested, \ndiluted and plated on SC-URA low-ADE plates. Plates were incubated at 30C for 2–3 \ndays, until visible and countable pink (ADE2 KO) and white (ADE2 WT) colonies grew. \nEditing efficiency was calculated in two ways. The first was by calculating the ratio of \npink to total colonies on each plate for each timepoint. This counting was performed by an \nexperimenter blind to the condition. The second was by deep sequencing of the target ADE2 \nlocus. For this, we harvested cells from 250ul aliquots of the culture for each timepoint \nin PCR strips, and performed a genomic prep as follows. The pellets were resuspended in \n120ul lysis buffer (see above), heated at 100C for 15 minutes and cooled on ice. 60ul of \nprotein precipitation buffer (7.5M Ammonium Acetate) was added and the samples were \ngently inverted and placed at −20C for 10 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged at \nmaximum speed for 2 minutes, and the supernatant was collected in new Eppendorf tubes. \nNucleic acids were precipitated by adding equal parts ice-cold isopropanol, and incubating \nthe samples at −20C for 10 minutes, followed by pelleting by centrifugation at maximum \nspeed for 2 minutes. The pellets were washed twice with 200ul ice-cold 70% ethanol, and \ndissolved in 40ul of water. 0.5ul of the gDNA was used as template in 10ul reactions with \nprimers flanking the edit site in ADE2, which additionally contained adapters for Illumina \nsequencing preparation (see Supplemental Table 4 for oligo sequences). Importantly, the \nprimers do not bind to the ncRNA/gRNA plasmids. These amplicons were indexed and \nsequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument and processed with custom Python software to \nquantify the percent of P272X edits, caused by Cas9 cleavage of the target site on the ADE2 \nlocus and repair using the Eco1 ncRNA-derived RT-DNA template.\nThe editing experiments at additional loci were carried out as described above, with \nthe difference that editing was quantified by amplifying 0.5ul of the gDNA with loci-\nspecific primers, adapters for Illumina sequencing preparation. These primers are listed in \nSupplemental Table 3. Custom Python software was used to quantify the percent of precise \nedits, caused by Cas9 cleavage of the target site on the ADE2 locus and repair using the \nEco1 ncRNA-derived RT-DNA template.\nLopez et al.

Cultures were passaged \nand doxycycline refreshed the following day for 48 more hours. 3 days post-transfection, \ncells were harvested for sequencing analysis.\nTo prep samples for sequencing, cell pellets were processed and gDNA extracted using a \nQIAamp DNA mini kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in \n200uL of ultra-pure, nuclease free water. Then, 0.5ul of the gDNA was used as template in \n12.5ul PCR reactions with primer pairs to amplify the locus of interest, which additionally \ncontained adapters for Illumina sequencing preparation (see Supplemental Table 4 for \noligo sequences).

Shipman 1,2,*\n1Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA,2Department of Bioengineering\nand Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA and3La Jolla Institute for Immunology,\nLa Jolla, CA, USA\nReceived December 09, 2021; Revised March 02, 2022; Editorial Decision March 02, 2022; Accepted March 05, 2022\nABSTRACT\nRetrons are bacterial retroelements that produce\nsingle-stranded, reverse-transcribed DNA (RT-DNA)\nthat is a critical part of a newly discovered phage\ndefense system. Short retron RT-DNAs are produced\nfrom larger, structured RNAs via a unique 2\n′ -5′ initi-\nation and a mechanism for precise termination that\nis not yet understood. Interestingly, retron reverse\ntranscriptases (RTs) typically lack an RNase H do-\nmain and, therefore, depend on endogenous RNase\nH1 to remove RNA templates from RT-DNA. We ﬁnd\nevidence for an expanded role of RNase H1 in the\nmechanism of RT-DNA termination, beyond the mere\nremoval of RNA from RT-DNA:RNA hybrids. We show\nthat endogenous RNase H1 determines the termina-\ntion point of the retron RT-DNA, with differing effects\nacross retron subtypes, and that these effects can\nbe recapitulated using a reduced,\nin vitro system.\nWe exclude mechanisms of termination that rely on\nsteric effects of RNase H1 or RNA secondary struc-\nture and, instead, propose a model in which the ter-\ntiary structure of the single-stranded RT-DNA and re-\nmaining RNA template results in termination. Finally,\nwe show that this mechanism affects cellular func-\ntion, as retron-based phage defense is weaker in the\nabsence of RNase H1.\nINTRODUCTION\nRetrons are prokaryotic retroelements that have recently\nbeen shown to play a role in phage defense (1–4). Retrons\nconsist of three components: (1) a reverse transcriptase\n(RT), (2) a structured non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that is\nreverse transcribed by the RT into single-stranded, reverse-\ntranscribed DNA (RT-DNA), and (3) and one or more ac-\ncessoryproteins.Bioinformaticanalysesbasedonsequence\nhave identified more than 2,000 proposed retrons, account-\ningforupto ∼25%ofallbacterialretroelements,thoughto\ndatefewerthantwentyhavebeenverifiedandcharacterized\nbiochemically (5–8). Despite having only a cursory under-\nstandingofretronmechanismandfunction,thisRTfamily\nhas generated substantial interest for its ability to produce\nsingle-strandedRT-DNA invivo,whichallowsforsynthetic\nbiology applications in eukaryotic gene editing (9), recom-\nbineering (10) and high throughput mutagenesis (11).\nRetrons employ a unique mechanism for RT-DNA syn-\nthesis. The ncRNA template folds into a conserved sec-\nondary structure, insulated between two inverted repeats\n(a1/a2, Figure 1A). The retron RT recognizes the folded\nncRNA and reverse transcription is initiated from a con-\nserved guanosine 2\n′-OH adjacent to the inverted repeats,\nforming a 2′-5′ linkage between the template RNA and the\nnascentDNAstrand( 12–15).Insomeretronsthis2 ′-5′ link-\nage persists into the mature form of processed RT-DNA\n(16), while in others an exonuclease cleaves the DNA prod-\nuct resulting in a free 5′ end (17,18).\nUnlike viral reverse transcriptases, retron RTs do not\nfully reverse transcribe their template RNAs as a means of\nreplication, but instead terminate at a precise point in the\nmiddle of the retron ncRNA (Figure1A). This results in a\nshort RT-DNA product that varies in size by subtype from\n∼40–160 bases. When isolated from cells, retron RT-DNA\nis single stranded and degradation of the RNA template\nhas been shown to depend on endogenous RNase H1 (19).\nPrior experiments suggest that RNase H1 cleavage occurs\nquickly or perhaps is even coupled with reverse transcrip-\ntion (19). In another study it was observed that in the ab-\nsence of RNase H1 the length of Eco5 RT-DNA was al-\ntered, but in the same conditions the length of Eco7 was\nunaffected(15,19).Themechanismbywhichretronstermi-\nnate reverse transcription is not well understood.\nRecentworkdescribesafunctionfortheretronasacellu-\nlardefensesystemagainstphages( 1–4),inwhichtheretron\nRT-DNA may act as a phage sensor.

This close as-\nsociation, combined with the importance of RT-DNA in\nphagedefense,promptedustotestwhetherRNaseH1plays\na role in RT-DNA synthesis beyond simply removing the\nRNA in the DNA:RNA hybrid. We extend previous obser-\nvations (15,19), finding a prominent effect of host RNase\nH1 on RT-DNA termination, bothinvivo a n di nar e d u c e d\ninvitro system. Using this as a starting point to investigate\nretron RT-DNA termination, we find that, in addition to\nRNaseH1,preciseterminationrequiresthenativearchitec-\nture of the ncRNA. We propose a model in which removal\nof the RNA template leads to a tertiary DNA:RNA struc-\nture that enforces termination. At a cellular level, we show\nthat RNase H1 is also critical for retron-based phage de-\nfense.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAll biological replicates were collected from distinct sam-\nples and not the same sample measured repeatedly.\nStrain generation\nBacterial experiments were carried out in BL21-AI cells,\nor a derivative of BL21-AI cells. These cells harbor a T7\npolymerase driven by an arabinose-inducible promoter. A\nknockoutstrainfortheEco1operon(BL21\nΔEco1)wasprevi-\nouslydescribed( 20).Anadditionalstrain(BL21 ΔEco1;ΔrnhA)\nwas constructed from that strain, using a strategy based\non Datsenko and Wanner (21) to replace the rnhA operon\nwith an FRT-flanked chloramphenicol resistance cassette.\nThereplacementcassettewasamplifiedfrompKD3,adding\nhomology arms to the rnhA locus.

Selection for successfully transformed\ncells was performed by growing the transformed cultures\non kanamycin plates. A single colony from the culture was\npicked and grown in 5 ml of LB and 1 mM kanamycin,\nshaking overnight at 37◦C. The following morning 100 ul\nof the overnight culture was inoculated into 5 ml of LB\nand 1 mM kanamycin and allowed to shake at 37C for\n2 h during which the cells entered log growth phase. The\nfull 5mL culture was then added to 50 ml of LB, 35 ug/ml\nkanamycin, 1 mM IPTG and 200 ug/ml l-arabinose.

The reaction was incubated at 37◦Cf o r\n3 hours followed by the addition of 10 units of TURBO\nDNase (Thermo Fisher) for 15 min at 37\n◦C.

Con-\nstructs were transformed into BL21-AI cells and plated on\nan LB-kanamycin plate. A single colony was picked and\ngrown overnight shaking at 37\n◦C in 5 ml of LB with 1 mM\nKanamycin. 5 ml of culture was added to 1 L of LB and\nallowed to reach an OD of 0.5 shaking at 250 rpm in a baf-\nfledflaskat37\n◦C.ForEco1-RT,theculturewasthenplaced\non ice for 15 min. 1% arabinose and 0.02%L-rhamnose (1\nml of 20% solution) were added to induce expression and\nculturewas allowed to shake at 18\n◦Cf o r∼18 h. DBR1 was\ninduced with 1% Arabinose and 0.02%L-rhaminose (1 ml\nof 20% solution) and culture was allowed to shake at 37◦C\nfor 4 h. Cells were then spun down and stored at –20◦C\nor moved directly into the protein purification protocol\nbelow.\nEco1 RT and DBR1 purification was achieved by resus-\npending the 1 L cell pellet in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM\nTris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol).\nCells were lysed once using the Misonix Sonicator 3000 on\npower level 5.0 with 30 s on/3 0so f ff o r1 0c y c l e s .T h e\nlysed suspension was then spun at 18,000 rcf in a Beckman\nJL25.50 rotor at 4◦C for 30 min.

Briefly, 1.2 pmol of RNA was\ndenaturated at 95◦C in 50 mM Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, for\n3 min, and folded by cooling to room temperature over\n20 min and adding MgCl2 to the desired concentration of\n10 mM.

For this work, we used a B-\nstrainE.coli (BL21-AI)thatharborsanendogenousretron\n(retron-Eco1). To create a clean background for the ex-\npression of multiple retrons, we eliminated the endogenous\nretron operon, and then additionally removed endogenous\nRNase H1 (rnhA), to yield the two primary strains used in\nthis work: BL21\nΔEco1 and BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA. To understand\nthe generalizability of RNase H1′s role in RT-DNA syn-\nthesis, we analyzed the effect of RNase H1 on RT-DNA\nsynthesis in six retrons: Retron-Eco1 (Ec86), Retron-Eco2\n(Ec67), Retron-Eco4 (Ec83), Retron-Eco6 (Ec48), Retron-\nEco9 and Retron-Sen2 (St85). These six retrons span four\nRTClades,fromfourdifferentretronsubfamilies,withfour\ndifferenttypesofpredictedaccessorydomains( 2,5).Clade,\nsubfamily, and accessory type for each retron are provided\nin Supplementary Table S5.\nEach retron operon, comprising of the retron-RT,\nretron-RNA, and accessory protein(s), was cloned into\nT7-inducible expression vectors and transformed into\nBL21\nΔEco1 and BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA cells. Retron operons were\noverexpressedandRT-DNAwasisolatedandvisualizedon\na TBE-urea gel. (Figure1B). In the presence of RNase H1,\nall retrons generate RT-DNA products of approximately\nthe expected length based on previous literature - Eco1 (re-\nported as 86 bases) (33), Eco2 (reported as 67 bases) (34),\nEco4(reportedas79bases)( 35),Eco6(reportedas48bases)\n(36,37), Eco9 (reported between 50 and 100 bases) (1), and\nSen2 (reported between 50 and 100 bases) (38,39). Five of\nthe six retrons tested displayed dramatically different RT-\nDNA profiles in the absence vs. presence of RNase H1.\nEco4RT-DNAisnearlyeliminatedintheabsenceofRNase\nH1. In contrast, Eco2 appears to be unaffected by RNase\nH1 (Figure1B).\nPAGE gel analyses have been the standard in the retron\nfield, and provide an estimate of the size of the most preva-\nlent polynucleotides in the population. However, PAGE\ngels are unable to quantify the lengths of molecules in\na heterogenous population and provide no sequence in-\nformation. Therefore, we applied multiplexed Illumina se-\nquencing to the retron RT-DNA to provide a more quan-\ntitative and precise view of RT-DNA production across\nconditions.\nWe isolated the RT-DNA producedin vivofrom each\nretron and processed them for sequencing using an un-\nbiased custom sequencing method (20). Briefly, RT-DNA\nsampleswereprocessedwithDBR1toremovethe2\n′-5′ link-\nage present in some RT-DNA samples. Each sample was\nextendedonthe3\n′ endwithadeninebasesusingatemplate-\nindependent polymerase (TdT), after which an adapter-\ncontainingprimerwasusedtogeneratethecomplementary\nstrandviaKlenowextension,andfinallyaseparateadapter\nwas ligated to the other end of the resulting dsDNA.

To test this\npotential bias, we synthesized and sequenced three sets of\nfouroligonucleotideswitheachofthefourpossibleterminal\nbases, mixed at an equal concentration.

A\nbinned histogram with the length of each retron RT-DNA\nin the presence and absence of RNase H1 is shown in Fig-\nure 1C–F. Plotting the length distribution of the sequences\nconfirmed that all retrons produced a nearly homogenous\npopulation of RT-DNA in the presence of RNase H1 (Fig-\nure 1C–H). In the absence RNase H1, the distribution of\nthe RT-DNA’s length was much broader for retrons Eco1,\nEco6, Eco9 and Sen2. Eco2 showed no change in length,\nconsistent with PAGE gel result, and Eco4 produced so lit-\ntle RT-DNA in the absence of RNase H1 that it could not\nbe reliably prepared for sequencing. Based on these analy-\nses, endogenous RNase H1 consistently affects the length\ndistribution of RT-DNA molecules.\nRNase H1 determines sites of termination in a retron depen-\ndent manner\nVisualization by PAGE gel and length analysis of mul-\ntiplexed sequencing data show that, in the absence of\nRNase H1, RT-DNA length is highly heterogeneous for\nfour retrons. This heterogeneity suggests that in the ab-\nsence of RNase H1, the retron RT may load onto or fall\noff the template at different places, skip and/or duplicate\nvarious portions of the template, or continue beyond the\nnormal stop site. To distinguish between these possibilities,\nwe aligned the trimmed reads to a reference sequence con-\ntaining the retron ncRNA. The analysis showed that in the\npresence of RNase H1, most retrons produced RT-DNA\nwith little variation in the site of initiation and termination\n(Figure2).Schematicsshowcanonicalregionsoftheretron\nncRNA,includingtheflankinga1 /a2invertedrepeats,non-\nreversetranscribedregion(msr),andreversetranscribedre-\ngion (msd) for context.

The termination points\nwere as described except for Eco1 which produced RT-\nDNA that was one base shorter than was previously de-\nscribed, resulting in an RT-DNA that is 85 bases rather\nthan 86 (33)( F i g u r e2A; Supplementary Figure S2A). On\nthe 3\n′ end, in contrast to what was previously reported, we\nfound that Eco6 was shorter by three bases (36) (Supple-\nmentaryFigureS2D).Eco4andEco9produceunbranched\nRT-DNA, in which the 2’-5’ linkage is removed, and\nour data was consistent with the post-processing cleavage\npoint as previously described (1,35). We assume the dif-\nferences that we report in RT-DNA compared with the\nprevious literature represent a technical refinement gained\nby sequencing thousands of RT-DNA molecules individ-\nually instead of using bulk assays, and not a biological\ndifference.\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.6 3497\nIn vitrovalidation of RNase H1 as a requirement for correct\ntermination\nIt has been proposed that retrons form large complexes\n(200–600kDa)composedofbothproteinandRNAintheir\nbacterial hosts (41,42). Therefore, RNase H1 could be di-\nrectly responsible for the change in RT-DNA length or be\nindirectlymodifyingtheRNPcomplexbyrecruitinganad-\nditionalco-factor.Todistinguishbetweenthesetwohypoth-\nesizes,weoptimizedaminimal invitro reversetranscription\nassay from purified components.\nFirst, we expressed a 6X histidine (His)-tagged Eco1\nretronRTforpurification,withaTsfsolubilitydomainlink-\ning the His-tag to the N-terminus of the RT (Figure3A).\nRetron Eco1 RT was expressed for 18 h at 18\n◦C and iso-\nlated using a nickel affinity resin followed by a size exclu-\nsion column (Figure3B). Addition of the Tsf domain does\nnotaffectRT-DNAproduction invivo (SupplementaryFig-\nureS3A),thereforeitwasnotremoved.Next,Eco1Retron-\nncRNA wasinvitro transcribed using T7 polymerase (Fig-\nure 3C). To confirm that the purified RT was functional\nand producing 2′-5′ linked RT-DNA, we performed anin\nvitroreversetranscriptionassay,lookingforthepresenceof\nRT-DNA by PAGE analysis. In this experiment, the com-\nponents were added to the reaction systematically and the\nreaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37\n◦C. After 1\nh, the sample was treated with RNase A/T to quench the\nreactionanddegradeRNA.DNAproductswerevisualized\non a TBE-urea gel. We observein vitroproduction of RT-\nDNA at the expected size in the presence of Eco1 ncRNA,\nRT, dNTPs and RNase H1 (Figure3D).\nIn vivo, Eco1 RT-DNA is covalently linked to the RNA\nv i aa2\n′-5′ linkage (33). To confirm that purified RT also\nproduced 2′-5′ linked RT-DNA, thein vitroreaction was\ntreatedwithRecJ,a5 ′→3′ ssDNAexonuclease.Inthiscon-\ndition, the RT-DNA persists, indicating the RT-DNA pro-\nduced is protected at its 5\n′ end (Figure3D). By contrast,\nincubation with DBR1, an enzyme that cleaves 2′-5′ link-\nages,ledtoaslightshiftinsize,consistentwiththeremoval\nof the linkage and the four bases of RNA that remain af-\nter RNase A/T1 treatment (Figure3D). In the presence of\nboth DBR1 and RecJ, the band was degraded due to the\nde-protectionofthe5\n′ endbyDBR1(Figure 3D).Together,\ntheseexperimentsconfirmthatthepurifiedEco1RTprotein\nproduces2\n′-5′ linkedretron-derivedRT-DNAofthecorrect\nlength.\nTo test the requirement of RNase H1 for RT-DNA pro-\nduction invitro, we performed a reverse transcriptase reac-\ntion in the presence and absence of RNase H1. We post-\ntreatedbothreactionswithRNaseH1toavoidcomplicated\nbanding patterns due to single vs double stranded prod-\nucts and ran each reaction on a TBE Urea gel. Like thein\nvivosystem, omitting RNase H1 during reverse transcrip-\ntionledtotheproductionofalongerRT-DNA(Figure 3E).\nBy titrating the amount of RNase H1 present during the\nreaction, we could modify the ratio of short to long RT-\nDNA (Figure 3F). This experiment demonstrates that in\na minimalin vitrosystem, RNase H1 alone is capable of\nmodulating the length of Eco1 RT-DNA. Interestingly the\nband found at∼140 is also sometimes present in in vivo\nRT-DNA production experiments (Supplementary Figure\nS3B), demonstrating that in over-expression conditionsin\nvivo, RT-DNA may saturate the presence of endogenous\nRNase H1 resulting in these higher order products.\nSecondarystructureinEco1ncRNAisnotresponsibleforter-\nmination\nThe loss of RNase H1 resulted in reverse transcription\npast the canonical termination point in four retrons tested:\nEco1, Eco6, Eco9 and Sen2. One possible explanation is\nthat RNase H1 could physically block the progress of the\nRT, preventing additional reverse transcription. To test\nthe steric blocking hypothesis, a catalytically dead RNase\nH1 (RNase H1\nD10N) was constructed by mutating one of\nthe conserved catalytic residues (D10N) (43). We replaced\nthe endogenous RNase H1 in the knockout background\n(BL21\nΔEco1;ΔrnhA) with either RNase H1D10N or RNase\nH1wt driven by a constitutive promoter and the Eco1 RT\ndrivenbyapromoterdrivingover-expression.Thepresence\nof the RNase H1\nwt rescued the production of Eco1 RT-\nDNA at a single length when analyzed by PAGE gel, while\nRNaseH1D10N didnot(SupplementaryFigureS4A).While\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that the D10N mutation\ncaused a slight protein structural change resulting in a loss\nofbindingtotheRT,webelievethatthemorelikelyexplana-\ntionforthisresultisthatremovaloftheRNAcomponentof\ntheDNA:RNAhybridformeduponreversetranscriptionis\nnecessary for correct termination.\nAnothermodelforterminationhasbeenproposed,which\nsuggests that the retron secondary structure is responsible\nfor RT termination (44). When Eco1 ncRNA is foldedin\nsilico using RNAstructure (45), the termination site lands\ninside a loop on a short predicted hairpin (Supplemen-\ntary Figure S4B). To test whether this hairpin exists, we\nevaluated the secondary structure using chemical map-\nping (Figure4A). In this experiment,in vitrotranscribed\nretron ncRNA is exposed to 1-Methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhy-\ndride (1M7). Nucleotides that are not paired have more\nflexible phosphate backbones and therefore are reactive to\n1M7, resulting in the addition of a bulky side group at the\n2\n′hydroxylofthephosphatebackbone( 46).Conversely,nu-\ncleotidesthatarebase-pairedhavebackbonesthataremore\nrigid and therefore are not reactive to 1M7.

Surprisingly, there is a lack\nof reactivity in the bulge regions separating P4a/P4b and\nP4b/P4c and a more complicated reactivity pattern is ob-\nserved between P1 and P4, where the RT-DNA synthesis\nbegins.Basedonthesedata,thesecondarystructurecanbe\nmoreaccuratelyrepresentedwithoutthepredictedhairpins\nbetween P1/P4 and P3/P4 (Figure4C, D).\nThe chemical mapping results indicate it is unlikely that\nastemstructureexistsattheEco1terminationpoint.How-\never, it is possible that another secondary structure down-\nstream is responsible for termination. To test this hypothe-\nsis,weconstructedavectorwheretheportionofthencRNA\nthat is not reverse transcribed (msr) is separated from the\nreverse transcribed region of the ncRNA (msd) and these\ntwopiecesareexpressedfromtwodifferentpromoterswith\ntheintentionofcreatinganmsrandanmsdintrans,rather\nthan their endogenous cis architecture.

While\nwe cannot rule out some read-through transcription that\nwould create one transcript, the msr and msd on that tran-\nscript would still be separated by more than 200 bases, in-\ncluding a promoter, which we would consider to mimic the\nintendedtransarchitecture.Remarkably,ncRNAproduced\nfrom these two promoters is still functional for RT-DNA\nproduction, albeit at a lower level than the cis construct\n(Figure 4E, F). However, rather than terminating at the\ncanonical point, reverse transcription continues to the 5\n′\nend of the template RNA (Figure4E, F).\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.6 3499\nFigure 4.Secondary structure in Eco1 ncRNA is not responsible for termination.

To distinguish between these possi-\nbilities, we created a construct where an increasing number\nof bases from the msr sequence of the ncRNA were added\nback to the msd (template) in the trans architecture (Fig-\nure4E). If a secondary structure found downstream on the\nncRNA is important for termination, correct termination\nshould be restored when the sequence encoding this struc-\nture is included. However, these constructs never regained\nthe ability to terminate correctly, and only led to increas-\ningly long RT-DNAs (Figure4E). Based on these experi-\n3500 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,No.6\nments, we propose a model in which the tertiary structure\nof Eco1 ncRNA, rather than a secondary structure, deter-\nmines the termination point and that removal of template\nRNAbyRNaseH1isrequiredforthattertiarystructureto\nform.\nAbsenceofRNaseH1affectsaccessoryproteintoxinneutral-\nization\nBobonis etal.( 1) recently reported that the accessory pro-\nteins often present in retron operons can act as toxins that\nare neutralized in the presence of the retron’s RT and RT-\nDNA (1,2). Retron accessory proteins were categorized\nbased on their domains’ predicted function (5). The ac-\ncessory proteins of Eco1, Eco9 and Sen2 are predicted\nto have N-terminal nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase-like\n(NDT) and C-terminal DNA binding domains (5). Eco2\nis fused to its accessory protein which is predicted to be a\ntopoisomerase-primase domain (5). Eco4\n′s accessory pro-\ntein is predicted to have ATPase and Walker A and B mo-\ntifs (5). Eco6 has an accessory protein that is predicted to\nbe an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane\nhelices (5).\nWefoundevidencethattheRTandtheaccessoryprotein\nin retron Eco1 interact, either directly or as part of a com-\nplex,basedonmassspectroscopyanalysisofFLAG-tagged,\noverexpressedEco1-RT,whichco-immunoprecipitateswith\nendogenous accessory protein, similar to what is observed\nin Sen2 (1) (Supplementary Figure S5). However, whether\nthe RT-DNA interacts with the accessory protein as part\nof this neutralization is unknown. Given that removal\nof RNase H1 modifies the RT-DNA produced, we won-\ndered whether it would affect toxin neutralization. To test\nthis, we generated inducible constructs that contained ei-\nther the retron accessory protein alone or the full retron\noperon for three different families of RT-accessory protein\npairs, represented by Eco1, Eco4, Eco6, and Eco9/Sen2.\nEachconstructwasthentransformedintoeitherBL21\nΔEco1\nor BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA. Cells were grown in either the presence\nor absence of inducers over 24 h at room temperature, and\nthe effect of each construct on cell growth was assessed by\nmeasuring the optical density (Figure5A).\nSurprisingly, the Eco1 and Eco6 accessory proteins did\nnot appear to be toxic, as the full operon and accessory\nprotein only strains grew to the same relative density (Fig-\nure 5B, C). In contrast, the Eco4 accessory protein had a\nvery strong toxic effect on cell growth (Figure5D). The\ngrowth defect caused by the accessory protein was largely\nneutralized by expressing the full operon, similar to what\nhas been previously reported for Eco9 and Sen2 (1). When\nthe Eco4 accessory protein only constructs were expressed\nin BL21\nΔEco1;ΔrnhA, a toxic affect was also observed and,\nagain, this toxic effect was mitigated by expressing the\nfull operon (Figure5E). We next analyzed the degree of\ntoxin neutralization by the full operon in each strain, de-\nfined as the full operon OD\n600 ratio (induced/uninduced)\novertheaccessoryaloneOD 600 ratio(induced/uninduced).\nWe found that the degree of toxin neutralization in the\nBL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA strain was lower than in the BL21ΔEco1\nstrain (Figure5F). A similar effect was observed for Eco9\nandSen2.Theaccessoryproteinconstructsexhibitedatoxic\neffectoncellgrowththatislargelyneutralizedwhenthefull\no p e r o ni se x p r e s s e d( F i g u r e5G, J), and both the toxic ef-\nfect and neutralization persist in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain\n(Figure5H,K).However,thedegreeoftoxinneutralization\nis reduced in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain compared to the\nBL21ΔEco1 strain (Figure5I, L). We conclude that RNase\nH1 is required for maximal accessory neutralization in\nretrons where the accessory has a toxic phenotype.\nAbsence of RNase H1 inhibits retron-based phage defense\nRetrons have been shown to confer defense against phages,\nwhichrequiresallthreecomponents:RT,RT-DNAandac-\ncessoryprotein.ToprobetheeffectofRNaseH1onretron-\nbasedphagedefense,wecreatedtwoconstructs:afullretron\noperon and an ncRNA/RT-only construct for Eco1, Eco4,\nand Eco9.

Eco1 in both the BL21\nΔEco1\nor BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhAconditions displayed no difference in\nphage defense between the ncRNA/RT and full operon\nconstructsagainstT2phage(Figure 6C–E).However,Eco1\ndid display defense against T5, consistent with previous\nreports, with far fewer plaques when the full operon was\nexpressed than the ncRNA/RT was expressed alone (Fig-\nure 6F–H) (2). This defense phenotype was reduced in\nthe BL21\nΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain as compared with the BL21ΔEco1\nstrain, indicating a role for RNase H1 in retron phage de-\nfense.\nWe found that the full Eco4 operon yielded significant\ndefense against T5 versus the ncRNA/RT alone, though\nprior work suggests that Eco4 defends against T2, but not\nT5 (2). For Eco4, like Eco1, the magnitude of defense\nagainst T5 was lower in the BL21\nΔEco1;ΔrnhAstrain than in\ntheBL21ΔEco1 strain(Figure 6I–N).Aphagephenotypefor\nEco9hasnotbeenpreviouslyestablished.Ourdatademon-\nstrate that the full Eco9 operon defends modestly against\nT2 (Figure6O–T) and that this defense is also significantly\ndiminished in the BL21ΔEco1;ΔrnhA strain compared to the\nBL21ΔEco1strain. Overall, these results point to a general\nrole for RNase H1 in retron-based phage defense across\nretron subtypes and phages.\nDISCUSSION\nInthisstudy,wedemonstratethatRNaseH1playsafunda-\nmentalroleinthemechanismofretronreversetranscription\nand phage defense.

Additionally, we character-\nized RT-DNA from six retrons using multiplexed sequenc-\ning to provide a quantitative characterization of the RT-\nDNA population in the presence and absence of RNase\nH1. The most severely affected retron is Eco4, where RT-\nDNA is nearly eliminated in the absence of RNase H1.\nEco1, Eco6, Eco9 and Sen2 all generate RT-DNA prod-\nucts of non-canonical lengths, reminiscent of early exper-\niments with Eco5 (14,15), whereas Eco2 is unaffected by\nRNase H1, similar to what was previously observed for\nEco7 (14,15).\nWe advance the understanding of retron termination,\nshowing that termination is not mediated by a steric effect\nofRNaseH1,orbysecondarystructureofthencRNA.In-\nstead, we propose that termination is mediated by tertiary\nstructurethatformsuponremovalofthetemplateRNAby\nRNase H1. Finally, we show that not all retron accessory\nproteins are toxic, but when they are, RNase H1 affects the\nabilityofretronRT-DNAtoneutralizethetoxiceffect.Re-\ngardlessofwhethertheaccessoryproteinistoxicornot,the\nactivity of RNase H1 affects ability of the retron to defend\nbacterial populations against phages.\nThese experiments also yield insight into the specific\nmechanism of Eco1 termination. We performed experi-\nments to test a previously proposed model in which sec-\nondary structure mediates termination (44). Our data does\nnot support this model for Eco1 based on both direct eval-\nuation of ncRNA secondary structure and the absence of\ntermination in the circularly permutated constructs. We in-\nstead propose a model in which termination in Eco1 is\nachievedthroughthetertiaryfoldingofthesingle-stranded\nRT-DNA/ncRNA template region. Supporting this hy-\npothesis is the lack of reactivity in the bulge regions be-\ntween P4a/b/c and the complex reactivity observed be-\ntweenregionP1 /4andP3 /4intheEco1ncRNA.Addition-\nally,retronterminationwasaffectedbyboththeabsenceof\nRNase H1 and the separation of the msr (primer) and msd\n(template) components of the ncRNA. These data are uni-\nfied in a model where the single-stranded RT-DNA and re-\nmainingncRNAscaffoldfoldsintoatertiarystructurethat\nenforces precise termination.\nWhiletheproposedmodelofatoxiceffectinducedbythe\naccessoryproteinforphagedefensewassupportedbyEco4\nandEco9,notoxicphenotypewasshownforaccessorypro-\nteins of Eco1 and Eco6. This is not simply explained by ac-\ncessory protein domain category, as Eco1 and Eco9 share\nthesameaccessoryproteinneutralizationfamily(predicted\nNDT-DNA binding domain), whereas Eco6 is in an en-\ntirely different family (two transmembrane integral mem-\nbrane protein).

{"text": "Predictable NHEJ Insertion and\nAssessment of HDR Editing Strategies\nin Plants\nKutubuddin A. Molla1,2†, Justin Shih1†, Matthew S. Wheatley1 and Yinong Yang1*\n1Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology and the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania\nState University, University Park, PA, United States,2ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, India\nCanonical CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique has profoundly impacted theﬁelds of\nplant biology, biotechnology, and crop improvement. Since non-homologous end joining\n(NHEJ) is usually considered to generate random indels, its high efﬁciency mutation is\ngenerally not pertinent to precise edit ing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) can\nmediate precise editing with supplied d onor DNA, but it suffers from extreme low\nefﬁciency in higher plants. Therefore, precision editing in plants will be facilitated by\nthe ability to predict NHEJ repair outcome and to improve HDR efﬁciency. Here, we\nreport that NHEJ-mediated single nucleotide insertion at different rice genes is\npredictable based on DNA sequences at the target loci. Three mutation prediction\ntools (inDelphi, FORECasT, and SPROUT) have been validated in the rice plant\nsystem. We also evaluated the chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) and Cas9-Retron\nprecISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY) strategies to facilitate donor\ntemplate supply for improving HDR ef ﬁciency in Nicotiana benthamiana and rice.\nHowever, neither cgRNA nor CRISPEY improved plant HDR editing efﬁciency in this study.\nInterestingly, our data indicate that tethering of 200–250 nucleotides long sequence to either\n5′ or 3′ ends of guide RNA did not signiﬁcantly affect Cas9 cleavage activity.\nKeywords: CRISPR-Cas9, genome editing, guide RNA engineering, homology-directed repair, non-homologous end\njoining, NHEJ prediction\nINTRODUCTION\nCrop improvement greatly relies on exploiting existing- and creating new-genetic variations.\nConventional CRISPR-Cas tools have greatly facilitated the generation of targeted genetic\nvariations in plants by producing random indels through the non-homologous end joining\n(NHEJ) repair pathway (Xie and Yang, 2013; Molla et al., 2020a). Base editing, an emerging\ntechnology, can precisely install four transition and two transversion point mutations (Molla and\nYang, 2019; Molla and Yang, 2020a; Molla et al., 2020b; Molla et al., 2020c). However, neither\nCRISPR-Cas nor base editing can generate precise indels, which are also important for plant trait\nimprovement. To generate precise indels, we mainly depend on utilizing the homology-directed\nrepair (HDR) pathway. Unfortunately, HDR is template-directed and inef ﬁcient, limiting its\napplication in crop improvement. Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) in DNA is repaired\npredominantly through the NHEJ pathway in higher plants. Therefore, unlike HDR, NHEJ-mediated\nmutagenesis is highly efﬁcient in plants. If we could predict the DSB repair outcome, it would\nfacilitate generating precise indels.\nEdited by:\nBing Yang,\nUniversity of Missouri, United States\nReviewed by:\nQiudeng Que,\nSyngenta, United States\nChuanxiao Xie,\nInstitute of Crop Sciences (CAAS),\nChina\n*Correspondence:\nYinong Yang\nyuy3@psu.edu\n†These authors have contributed\nequally to this work and shareﬁrst\nauthorship\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nGenome Editing in Plants,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Genome Editing\nReceived: 30 November 2021\nAccepted: 23 February 2022\nPublished: 16 March 2022\nCitation:\nMolla KA, Shih J, Wheatley MS and\nYang Y (2022) Predictable NHEJ\nInsertion and Assessment of HDR\nEditing Strategies in Plants.\nFront.

Large datasets were utilized to\ndevelop models (inDelphi, FORECAST, SPROUT, and\nCROTON) for predicting Cas9 repair outcome in\nmammalian cells ( Shen et al., 2018 ; Allen et al., 2019 ;\nLeenay et al., 2019; Molla and Yang, 2020b; Li et al., 2021).\nThose computational tools predi ct repair outcomes, mainly\nthe frequency of 1 bp insertions and small deletions, with high\nefﬁciency (Molla and Yang, 2020b). Although the models have\nbeen developed exploiting Cas9 repair data from mammalian\ncells, we hypothesize that they could also be used to predict\nrepair outcomes in plant cells since the mutations largely\ndepend on the local DNA sequence near the DSB ( Molla\nand Yang, 2020b ). However, no single study reports Cas9\nrepair outcome prediction in plants or validates those\npredictor models in plants.\nHDR is highly valuable in precise gene replacements,\nknock-in, and installing complex modi ﬁcations. However,\nachieving a decent ef ﬁciency in higher plants is a major\nhurdle to using HDR regularly in crop improvements. For\nHDR to be successful, adequate donor repair templates are\nneeded to be available near the DSB. Temporal and spatial\ncoordination between DSB crea tion and supplying adequate\ndonor templates are considered the major bottlenecks in HDR\n(Li et al., 2018; Huang and Puchta, 2019). Several strategies\nsuch as using geminivirus replicons ( Čermák et al., 2015 ),\nchimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) (Butt et al., 2017), chemically\nmodiﬁed donor DNA, tandem repeat HDR (TR-HDR) ( Lu\net al., 2020), and transcript-templated HDR (TT-HDR) ( Li\net al., 2019) have been used to overcome these bottlenecks. To\nmake the donor templates available onsite of DSB, one\nattractive approach is to fuse them with the guide RNA\n(gRNA) sequence. For example, the use of chimeric guide\nRNA (cgRNA) molecule, containing gRNA fused with donor\ntemplate, has been demonstrated to induce HDR in rice (Butt\net al., 2017). cgRNA strategy was based on donor template\nfusion at the 3’end of sgRNA and RNA-templated DNA repair\n(Butt et al., 2017 ). Recently, an interesting strategy, Cas9-\nRetron precISe Parallel Editing via homologY (CRISPEY),\ndescribed the utilization of bacterial retron to produce\nsingle-stranded donor DNA that is tethered with sgRNA\n(Sharon et al., 2018). CRISPEY strategy has been shown to\nimprove HDR efﬁciency up to 96% in yeast (Sharon et al.,\n2018). In human cells, CRISPEY achieved HDR rates of up to\n11.3% (Kong et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). However, there is\nno report of plant HDR improvement utilizing a bacterial\nretron system.\nIn this study, we explored to achieve HDR-mediated editing\nusing cgRNA and CRISPEY strategies in tobacco and rice for six\ndifferent target genes. We also investigated predicting Cas9 repair\noutcome in plants utilizing the predictor models generated for\nmammalian systems. The ﬁndings could be helpful for precise\ngenome editing in plants.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nVector Construction\nWe have designed modiﬁed versions of the CRISPEY construct\ndescribed earlier (Sharon et al., 2018). For GFP to BFP conversion\nin Nicotiana benthamiana, we fused tobacco codon optimized\nE. coli Ec86-reverse transcriptase (Ec86-RT) with P2A-Cas9 for\nco-translational expression ofboth Ec86-RT and Cas9 by CaMV35S\npromoter. P2A is a self-cleaving peptide. A chimeric RNA of Ec86\nretron sequence with a gRNA was expressed by AtU6 promoter. It\nwas designed in such a way that a portion of retron sequence was\nreplaced with a donor template sequence harboring the mutations\nnecessary for GFP to BFP conversion (Supplementary Table S1and\nSupplementary Sequence).\nFor rice, we ﬁrst constructed a basic vector pK-CRISPEY,\nwhich contains three distinct cassettes. The ﬁrst one is a rice\ncodon-optimized Ec86-RT expression cassette. Ec86-RT was\ndriven by OsUbi10 promoter and terminated with\nAgrobacterium gene seven terminator. The second one was\nto express a chimeric RNA of Ec86 retron sequence with a\ngRNA. A portion of retron sequence was replaced with speciﬁc\ndonor template sequences. This cassette was driven by CaMV\n35S promoter and terminated by Arabidopsis HSP terminator.\nThe 5′ and 3′ end of the chimeric retron-guide sequence was\nﬂanked by the hammerhead (HH) ribozyme and the hepatitis\ndelta virus (HDV) ribozyme, respectively. Two Aar1 sites were\nincorporated upstream of the gRNA scaffold sequence for easy\ncloning of donor template plus protospacer sequence. The\ndonor template was at the 5’ end of the protospacer. The third\ncassette was to express SpCas9. We synthesized the ﬁrst two\ncassettes and cloned them at the HindIII/BsaI sites of\npRGEB32 vector replacing 402 bp to construct pK-\nCRISPEY. The original hygromycin phosphotransferase\n(HPT) gene cassette of pRGEB32 was intact ( Xie et al.,\n2015). We separately synthesized donor plus protospacer\nfor each of the three targets, OsALS, OsCC, and OsActin,\nand cloned at the AarI sites of pK-CRISPEY. Three vectors\nwere named as pK-CRISPEY-ALS, pK-CRISPEY-CC, and pK-\nCRISPEY-Actin ( Supplementary Table S1 and\nSupplementary Sequence ).\nFor the cgRNA approach, a polycistronic-tRNA-gRNA (PTG)\nmultiplexing cassette was designed to repair three targets\nsimultaneously (Xie et al., 2015). It comprises three gRNAs,\nOsALS, OsPita , and OsPtr, each with their speci ﬁc repair\ntemplate at the 3′ ends of the scaffolds.ALS and Pita required\nonly a few base pairs modiﬁcation, so the repair template was\ndesigned with 100 bp homology ﬂanks from the DSB\n(Supplementary Table S1 ). Since the Ptr needed a 12 bp\ndeletion and various base-pair changes over a larger region, we\nused 125 bp homology arms. Synonymous mutations were\nintroduced in repair templates to prevent Cas9 from re-cutting\nafter successful HDR repair. The PTG fragment with repair\ntemplates was synthesized (GenScript, NJ, United States) and\nthen cloned downstream of the OsU3 promoter into the binary\nvector pRGEB32 using the compatible overhangs generated by\nBsaI digestion. Guide RNAs with repair templates fused at their 3’\nends are termed as chimeric guide RNA (cgRNA) following an\nFrontiers in Genome Editing | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 8252362\nMolla et al.

This new construct is termed\npCgAPP (Supplementary Sequence).\npK-CRISPEY-ALS, pK-CRISPEY-CC, pK-CRISPEY-Actin,\nand pCgAPP were introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens\nstrain EHA105 via electroporation for subsequent\nagroinﬁltration and/or stable transformation in tobacco and rice.\nAgroinﬁltration and Generation of Stable\nTransgenics inNicotiana benthamiana\nNicotiana benthamiana 16c, a transgenic line highly expressing\nmGFP, was used in this study (Ruiz et al., 1998). 16c line was a\ngenerous gift from Prof. David Baulcombe (United Kingdom).\nAgroinﬁltration was performed using four to 6 week old plants\ngrown at 25\n°C and 75% humidity (75%) under the 16 h light\n(100 µmol photons m−2 s−1) according to a previously described\nprotocol with few modiﬁcations (Yang et al., 2000). Brieﬂy, MMA\nsolution (10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, 150μM acetosyringone)\nwas used as inﬁltration solution to resuspendAgrobacterium cells\n(EHA105) to an OD600 = 1. The abaxial leaf regions to be\ninﬁltrated were punctured with a small needle. A 1-ml syringe\n(without needle) was used to inﬁltrate Agrobacterium suspension.\nTo develop stable transgenic plants, fully expanded fresh\nleaves were collected and sterilized by immersing in 70%\nethanol for 60 s, washing in 7.5% bleach plus one drop\nTween-20 solution for 20 min, and repeatedly washing in\nsterile distilled water. Round leaf discs were prepared by\npressing a cork borer against an N. benthamiana leaf on a\nPetri dish base. Leaf discs were incubated in Agrobacterium\nsuspension (OD\n600 = 1, 100 µM acetosyringone) for 30 min.\nThe discs were blot dried and incubated in cocultivation media\n(4.3 g/L MS salts, 30 g/L sucrose, 1 mg/L 6-\nbenzylaminopurine, 0.1 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, and\n100 μM Acetosyringone) for 2 days in the dark. Leaf discs were\nwashed for removing extra bacterial cells, blot dried, and\ntransferred to regeneration selection media (4.3 g/L MS\nsalts, 30 g/L sucrose, 1 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine, 0.1 mg/L\n1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 400 mg/L Timentin, and 10 mg/L\nhygromycin). The plates were incubated at 28\n°C with an 18 h\nlight regime. Leaf discs were moved to fresh media plates every\n14– 15 days. After 2 weeks of selection, callus tissue starts\nappearing from the cut ends of the disk. Shoots growing\nfrom the selected calli were dissected and placed in rooting\nmedia (MS salts, 30 gm/L sucrose, 25 mg/L hygromycin) to\nproduce plantlets. Shoots were individually excised from the\ncalli once they reached a height of >3 m m .A f t e r2 w e e k si n\nrooting media, roots were adequately developed. Plantlets with\nwell-developed roots were transferred to soil pot in\ngreenhouse.\nRice Transformation and Regeneration\nKitaake and Jupiter (Oryza sativasubsp. japonica) rice genotypes\nwas used for genetic transformation. Mature embryo-derived calli\nwere transformed with all four constructs using the\nAgrobacterium-mediated method following an earlier described\nprotocol (Molla et al., 2020a). Brieﬂy, transformed calli were\nselected in hygromycin (50 mg/L) containing media. Selected and\nproliferating calli were either transferred to regeneration media or\ncollected for DNA isolation. Regenerated shoots were transferred\nto rooting media. Well-rooted plantlets were transferred to soil\nand grown in a greenhouse.\nMicroscopical Analysis\nSegments of leaf tissue (1– 2 cm) were excised, and the pieces were\nmounted in water on glass microscope slides with a coverslip. The\nleaves were imaged using an Observer SD spinning disc confocal\nmicroscope (Zeiss, Germany). Samples were visualized and\nphotographed using 405 nm (Blue) and 488 nm (Green)ﬁlters.\nGenotyping of Editing Outcomes\nFor the three CRISPEY constructs, hygromycin-resistant calli\nwere used for DNA isolation after two rounds of selection.\nIsolated DNAs from calli samples were used to amplify the\ntarget regions. PCR products were pooled and subjected to\ndeep amplicon sequencing by using Genewiz amplicon EZ\nsequencing service (Genewiz, United States). After adapter\nligation and library preparation, the samples were sequenced\nusing a 2 × 250 paired-end conﬁguration. Image analysis and\nbase calling were conducted bythe Illumina Control Software\non the Illumina instrument. Raw sequence data were\ndemultiplexed using bcl2fastq version 2.17.1.14. Read pairs\nwere trimmed for adapter sequences and low-quality basecalls\nusing Trimmomatic version 0.36. Each read pair was then\nmerged using the bbmerge tool from the BBtools software\ntoolkit. The target sequence between conserved ﬂanking\nprimers was extracted from each merged pair. For each\nsample, one excel ﬁle was generated to contain the unique\nnucleotide sequences and their abundances, and one excelﬁle\nwas generated to contain the unique amino acid sequences and\ntheir abundance for each sample. The QIIME data analysis\npackage was used to generate OTU sequences. OTU clusters\nare deﬁned by a 97% identity threshold.\nWe also regenerated plants (Jupiter variety) for pCgAPP\nconstruct. Total DNA was isolated from leaf samples collected\nfrom each individual plant following an earlier described protocol\n(Molla et al., 2020c). Target regions ofALS, Pita, andPtr loci were\nampliﬁed by PCR using speciﬁc pair of primers. Puriﬁed PCR\nproducts were sequenced and decoded using TIDE for editing\noutcomes ( Brinkman et al., 2014 ). All primers used for\ngenotyping are listed inSupplementary Table S1.\nPrediction of NHEJ Outcome\nWe employed three models, inDelphi, FORECast and\nSPROUT, for predicting NHEJ mutation outcome ( Molla\nand Yang, 2020b ). The inDelphi is available with the link:\nhttps://indelphi.giffordlab. mit.edu/. Protospacer with 50 bp\nﬂanking sequence on each side was provided as input in the\ninDelphi user interface. FORECasT was accessed with the link:\nhttps://partslab.sanger.ac.uk/FORECasT, while SPROUT was\naccessible by following the link: https://zou-group.github.io/\nSPROUT. For FORECasT, around 40 – 50 bp target genomic\nsequence, including protospacer, is required. SPROUT\nrequires 20 bp protospacer plus 3 bp PAM sequence for\nprediction. The prediction outputs from each model were\nFrontiers in Genome Editing | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 8252363\nMolla et al.

Predictable NHEJ Insertion in Plants\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nUtilizing Retron for HDR inNicotiana\nbenthamiana and Rice\nRetrons are prokaryotic retroelements that can produce\nmulticopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). Bacterial retrons\nhave recently been shown to function in antiphage defense\n(Millman et al., 2020). Retron Ec86, from E. coli, contains a\ncassette that encodes a unique RNA (msd-msr) and a reverse\ntranscriptase (Ec86-RT) ( Inouye et al., 1999 ). Ec86-RT can\nreverse transcribe the msd portion into single-stranded DNA\nthat remains tethered to its template RNA (Inouye et al., 1999). By\naltering a part of msd-msr sequence, single-stranded DNA\n(ssDNA) containing desired mutations ﬂanked by homology\nto a targeted genomic region could be produced in vivo .\nRetron-derived ssDNA has been demonstrated to facilitate\ntemplate-mediated genome editing in yeast ( Sharon et al.,\n2018; Gallagher et al., 2020), mammalian cells (Kong et al.,\n2021; Zhao et al., 2021), and bacteria (Schubert et al., 2021).\nWe fused the retron seq (msd-msr altered with donor sequence of\ninterest) at the 5′ end of the gRNA to generate a chimeric\ntranscript. After reverse transcription by Ec86RT, the donor\nssDNA template would be tethered to the transcript and be\navailable near the DSB for template-dependent repair.\nEnvisaging retron could be harnessed for HDR-editing in\nplant cells, we set out to validateﬁrst in a GFP expressingN.\nbenthamiana 16c line. To test if retron can promote HDR, we\nused a reporter system that results in GFP to BFP conversion. We\ndesigned a binary construct to express Cas9, Ec86RT, and retron\nsequence harboring information to produce donor ssDNA\ntemplates ( Figure 1A ). We introduced a single nucleotide\nchange (\nTAT > CAT) for mGFP to BFP conversion (Tyr >\nHis) and an additional three synonymous mutations in the\nprotospacer seed region to prevent re-cutting the donor\ntemplate by Cas9. We could not detect blueﬂuorescence when\nwe analyzed leaf samples by confocal microscopy after several\nrounds of agroinﬁltration. Similar results were obtained for\nsamples collected after 3, 7, and 10 days of in ﬁltration.\nAssuming that transient expression might not be sufﬁcient to\ninduce HDR, we performed leaf disc transformation with the\nconstruct and regenerated >50 stably transformed plants\n(Supplementary Figures S1A,B ). Plants were analyzed for\nchange in ﬂuorescence from green to blue. We could notﬁnd\na single plant with alteredﬂuorescence (Supplementary Figure\nS1C). Sanger sequencing of 30 randomly chosen plants also did\nnot reveal successful editing. We reasoned that the failure might\nbe due to the inef ﬁciency of the guide RNA used for the\nexperiment. The guide RNA contains 5′-CTTA-3′ immediately\nadjacent to PAM sequence (Supplementary Figure 1D). The 5′-\nCTTA-3′ motif has been shown to be inefﬁcient in genome\nediting in an earlier systematic study (Graf et al., 2019).\nThen we attempted to test the same strategy in rice by\ntargeting three genes, OsALS (OsKitaake02g183100), OsCC\n(OsKitaake05g165200), and OsActin (OsKitaake03g316400),\nseparately (Figure 1B). For ALS, one nucleotide change (T\nGG\n> TTG) causing W > L for herbicide tolerance and another\nnucleotide change for PAM destruction were included in the\ndonor template. We attempted to knock-in a 12 bp sequence\nharboring EcoRI and HindIII recognition sites inCC target and\n6 bp EcoRI recognition sequence inActin target. Three constructs\nwere independently transformed to rice calli via the\nAgrobacterium-mediated transformation. After two consecutive\nselections in hygromycin, proliferating calli were collected for\nDNA isolation. For initial veriﬁcation, we ampliﬁed the ALS\ntarget region and digested it with Mfe1 since successful editing\nevents should generate a recognition site for the enzyme. We\nobserved many samples exhibited Mfe1 positive results. It should\nbe noted here that Mfe1 could also be generated if there is a single\nT insertion (NHEJ) at the cut point. Then, we sequenced\nrandomly chosen 12 samples and analyzed them using\nSynthego ICE tool. Excitingly, the ICE analysis revealed a\nknock-in efﬁciency of up to 23% in the tested calli for theALS\ntarget (Supplementary Figure S2).\nFor further validating the result and obtaining a clear idea of\nediting efﬁciency, we performed amplicon deep sequencing. For\neach construct, DNA was isolated from 30 independent calli\nsamples. We ampliﬁed target regions using PCR and pooled 10\nsamples into one for deep amplicon sequencing. On an average,\nwe obtained >50 K reads for each sample. Strikingly, results\nrevealed no HDR events occurred in the case of ALS and\nActin targets. This observation indicated that, for one or two\nnucleotide replacements, as in the case ofALS, the ICE tool is not\nhighly sensitive and may mislead on the editing output. Amplicon\ndeep sequence is recommended to get a clear picture of the editing\nevents. However, for theCC target, we observed only one read\nwith a perfect 12 bp knock-in. We have observed high NHEJ\nefﬁciency in all three cases. Overall, retron-mediated template\nediting has not been successful in tobacco and rice. Around 16\nbacterial retron systems have been experimentally validated and\nhave their fully annotated components available in the public\ndatabase (Simon et al., 2019). Recently, modiﬁcations in the\nretron non-coding RNA that increases production of reverse\ntranscribed DNA have been identi ﬁed (Lopez et al., 2021 ).\nSystematic studies are required toﬁnd suitable retron systems\nfor plant genome editing.\nChimeric gRNA Approach for HDR in Rice\nAnother approach to make the repair template available at the\nvicinity of DSB is to fuse the template sequence with gRNA\nsequence. After successful transcription, a chimeric guide RNA\n(cgRNA) would be produced containing gRNA for Cas9-\nmediated targeted DSB generation and RNA repair template\nfor HDR editing (Figure 1C). An earlier study demonstrated\n2.14% HDR efﬁciency of cgRNA approach in regenerated rice\nplants (Butt et al., 2017). Similarly, Cas12a mediated DSB coupled\nwith RNA donor template was reported to achieve successful\nHDR in rice (Li et al., 2019). Encouraged by these studies, we\ntested the strategy at three rice loci, ALS, Pita, and Ptr. The\npCgAPP construct was transformed in rice calli and 196\nhygromycin resistant T\n0 rice lines were obtained through\nregeneration. For the ALS and Pita targets, successful HDR\nevent would generate the recognition sites for MfeI and NcoI,\nFrontiers in Genome Editing | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 8252365\nMolla et al. Predictable NHEJ Insertion in Plants\nrespectively. To screen successful HDR events at thePtr locus,\nPCR positive/negative assay was employed by using one primer\nfor the genomic region outside the homology included in repair\ntemplate and a primer for the region over the deleted 12 bp\npolymorphism only found in the repair template\n(Supplementary Figure S3A). For ALS target, 25 out of the\n196 lines indicated success of the MfeI site generation\n(Figure 2A). However, no NcoI positive lines were generated\nfor Pita and no ampliﬁcation was observed forPtr. These results\nindicated unsuccessful HDR events atPita and Ptr loci.\nTo further investigate editing outcomes, the lines in which\nsuccessful MfeI sites generated were sequenced for all three target\nloci. Sanger chromatograms were decoded, aligned and compared\nto the WT and the repair template to analyze editing outcomes\n(Figures 2B,C). While forALS there were many positive MfeI\ndigestion results, sequencing revealed these occurred by single-T\ninsertions (NHEJ indel) and not by HDR. If HDR created the\ndesired changes, no indel should be observed, and all the\nsubstitutions from the repair template would be included. It is\nalso interesting that some alleles contain a correct substitution but\nat one side of the DSB point, suggesting one-sided HDR events\n(Supplementary Figure S3B). Overall, we observed 12% (3/26) of\nthe alleles to have a possible one-sided HDR inALS by evidence of\nbase substitution. For thePita gene, randomly chosen 17 lines\nwere sequenced. We observed 76% of the lines with indels. We\ncould not detect any instances of HDR inPita locus. Lastly, we\nsequenced Ptr locus in 20 random lines and have not found any\nevidence of editing either by NHEJ or HDR. ThePtr protospacer\ncontained a GCC motif in theﬁrst four nucleotides proximal to\nPAM, which was reported to be inefﬁcient in cleaving by Cas9\n(Graf et al., 2019). Based on the results we obtained for the three\nloci in rice, it seems cgRNA approach is not efﬁcient in mediating\nHDR editing.\nPrediction of NHEJ-Mediated Precise\nInsertion in Rice Genes\nCas9 induced DSB generation and subsequent NHEJ-mediated\ngenome editing is highly efﬁcient in plants. The NHEJ repair\noutcome is considered random and, therefore, not useful in\nprecise genome editing applications. However, several recent\nstudies in animal systems showed that the Cas9-mediated\nediting outcome is reproducible and predictable depending on\nthe features of target DNA sequences (Molla and Yang, 2020b).\nThe ability to predict the spectrum of DSB repair outcomes would\nfacilitate us in performing more efﬁcient gene knock-out and\nprecision genome editing applications without HDR. Using the\nDSB repair products of thousands of target DNA loci in\nmammalian cells, several machine learning models have been\ngenerated to predict the spectrum of CRISPR-Cas9 editing\nproducts (Shen et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2019; Leenay et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, no study has\nFIGURE 2 | (A)Representative gel images showing Mfe1 digestion ofALS product.

Predictable NHEJ Insertion in Plants\nreported predictability of Cas9-induced DSB repair outcome in\nplants. Therefore, we set out to analyze our dataset to examine if\nthe same prediction rules are applicable in plants and if the\nexisting machine learning models could be applicable to foresee\nthe Cas9-induced mutation outcome in plants.\nThe editing outcome that could be most reliably predicted is\nsingle nucleotide insertion (Molla and Yang, 2020b). Earlier studies\nreported that the inserted nucleotide is identical to the nucleotide at\n– 4f r o mt h eP A Ms e q u e n c e(Chakrabarti et al., 2019; Lemos et al.,\n2018). Therefore, if a T nucleotide is present at – 4o ft h e\nprotospacer sequence, another T nucleotide is highly likely to\nbe inserted ( Chakrabarti et al., 2019 ). However, the\npredictability decreases in the order T > A > C > Ga t – 4\nposition ( Molla and Yang, 2020b ). For a preliminary\ninvestigation, we have carefully chosen three protospacers, for\ntargeting ALS, Pita and Ptr,h a v i n gaTa t – 4p o s i t i o n\n(Figure 3A). The inDelphi model predicted single T insertion\nfor 13.9% of all products in theALS target locus (Figure 3B;\nSupplementary Figure S4). Interestingly, we observed 25 lines\n(12.75%) showed positive Mfe1 digestion out of 196 plants tested\nfrom our cgRNA experiment, indicating a single T insertion at the\ncut point. Sanger sequencing of those lines validated the result\n(Figure 2B). Similarly, deep sequencing data from our retron\nexperiment showed an average of 21.13% single T insertion\nwith the sameALS guide (Figure 3B). The FORECasT has also\npredicted single T insertion as the most dominant class of\nmutations ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Although SPROUT\npredicted 19% of the total reads with insertion, it failed to\naccurately predict the most likely inserted base (Supplementary\nFigure S4). For thePita guide, inDelphi and FORECasT computed\n13.9% and 16% single T insertion, respectively (Supplementary\nFigure S5). Our experimental data showed 18% of thePita alleles\nwere with a single T inserted. This time also, SPROUT was\ninaccurate in predicting the inserted base.\nFORECasT, SPROUT, and inDelphi predicted 13.2%, 12%,\nand 8.6% 1 bp insertion in theOsCC target locus, respectively.\nOur deep sequencing data showed 14.77% single C insertion\n(Figure 3C). inDelphi and FORECasT accurately predicted a C\ninsertion (Supplementary Figure S6). For theOsActin target,\nour result showed most abundant insertion type is single G\n(13.76%) followed by single C (3.62%) ( Figure 3C ).\nSurprisingly, inDelphi predicted the insertion types\naccurately. SPROUT displayed that the most likely inserted\nbase is G (Supplementary Figure S7 ). However, FORECasT\nwas not able to predict the insertions.\nThe above result indicates thatt h em o d e l sa r ep r e t t yg o o d\nin predicting the insertion types, especially 1 bp insertion and\ntheir fraction in the plant system. We found that the inDelphi\noutperformed the FORECasT and SPROUT in anticipating\nthe mutation outcome, especially the insertion class and\nfrequency. In contrast to the notion that the NHEJ\noutcome is random, our data suggest that the Cas9-induced\ndouble-strand break repair outcome is non-random and could\nbe predicted ( Molla and Yang, 2020b ). Single nucleotide\ninsertion is the most predictable class of repair genotype.\nWe found that the inserted nucleotide is identical to the\nnucleotide at – 4 from the PAM sequence in accordance\nwith earlier studies in mammalian cells ( Allen et al., 2019;\nChakrabarti et al., 2019 ). The insertion of a single base\nidentical to – 4 nucleotide in the protospacer indicates the\noccurrence of the following sequential events: Cas9-induced 5’\nsingle-base overhang generation, ﬁlling in by DNA\npolymerase, and ligation by ligase 4 ( Zuo and Liu, 2016 ;\nLemos et al., 2018 ; Molla and Yang, 2020b ). These events\nFIGURE 3 |Prediction of 1-bp insertion using models.(A) Protospacer\nsequences used in the study.

A recent study in\nmammalian cells showed that the fraction of 1 bp insertion\nrelative to other repair genotypes can be increased by the\nexogenous application of the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019\n(Bermudez-Cabrera et al., 2021 ).\nPrediction of Deletion and Base\nSubstitution\nUnlike insertion, the models tested here performed poorly in\npredicting the frequency and types of deletion and substitution\nevents.

MMEJ\ndeletes intervening bases between short tracts of local matching\nsequences (Her and Bunting, 2018 ) and, hence, the repair\noutcome is predictable by analyzing microhomologous\nsequences. Since SPROUT does not display deletion types and\ntheir respective frequencies, we considered analyzing only\ninDelphi and FORECasT in this section. Both inDelphi and\nFORECasT displayed prediction of MMEJ deletion with a high\npercentage. The difference between the predicted frequency and\nthe observed frequency of deletion events was highly signiﬁcant\n(p < 0.0001) (Figure 4B). We have also noticed that the models\npredicted deletions deviated from the observed deletion types in\nthe tested genomic sites ( Supplementary Tables S2– 4). For\nexample, a AA deletion was found to be the most frequent\n(average 6.7%) deletion type in theALS locus (Supplementary\nTable S2). However, inDelphi and FORECasT failed to predict\nthis deletion in their top nine deletion types (Supplementary\nFigure S4). ForActin, both inDelphi and FOREcasT projected an\nidentical 7 bp deletion with>10% frequency (top deletion class)\n(Supplementary Figure S7). Surprisingly, we could notﬁnd a\nsingle read with the −7 bp deletion in a total of 179 K reads\n(Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, observed deletion types at\nthe CC locus did not match the predicted deletions\n(Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S4). It\nis notable that while types of insertion were common across\ndifferent pooled samples for the same target, deletion types were\nfound rarely common (Supplementary Tables S2– 4). In our deep\nsequencing data, we found a signiﬁcant amount of reads with\ncombined insertion and deletion. Base substitutions were also\ncommon. However, the models (inDelphi, FORECasT, and\nSPROUT) cannot foresee these kinds of mutation classes. Our\nresults indicate that these models are not good at predicting\ndeletions and base changes in rice plant.\n59 and 3’ Modiﬁcations of Guide RNA Do Not\nSeem to Impact CRISPR-Cas9 Editing\nEfﬁciency\nT h ec o m m o n l yu s e ds i n g l eg u i d eR N A( g R N A )i saf u s i o no ft h e\ncrispr RNA (crRNA) and transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA)\nthrough a short RNA loop (Jinek et al., 2012). Engineering and\nmanipulation of gRNA has been one of the important areas of\nresearch for broadening the applications of the CRISPR-Cas system.\nThe introduction of extra nucleotides at either of the gRNA ends\ncould be useful for many genome editing applications, such as\nadding RNA aptamers to recruit different effector proteins and\nfusing donor templates for HDR. The degree of gRNA modiﬁcations\nthat can be tolerated without affecting its binding with Cas9 and\nsubsequent genome targeting is crucial to deﬁne (Nowak et al.,\n2016). Whether fusion of long sequence at either of the 5′ and 3’\nends of gRNA has any impact in Cas9 cleavage efﬁciency is not well\nestablished in the plant system.\nIn the retron approach, donor template coding sequences were\nfused at the 5′ end of the gRNA (Figure 1B). The length of the\nsequence fused was 228 nucleotides, including the chimeric\nretron-donor. The 5′ end is crucial for gRNA function as the\n20 bp protospacer that determines the genomic target site is\nlocated at this end. From our deep sequencing data at all three\ntarget sites, it is clear that the DSB formation ability of Cas9 was\nnot hampered at all by the fusion at 5′ end of gRNA. For example,\nin ALS, the CRISPEY construct yielded an average of 67.24%\nmutation, while the control construct with canonical gRNA\nshowed 68.30% of the population with mutation\n(Supplementary Table S2 ). Similarly, for the Actin target,\n77.86% mutant population was obtained with canonical gRNA,\nwhereas 87% mutant population was generated by 5′ extended\ngRNA (Supplementary Table S3). CC target was mutated with an\naverage ef ﬁciency of 79.15% with 5 ′ extended gRNA\n(Supplementary Table S4). The results of this study indicate\nthat 5′ extension of gRNA is probably not an inhibitory factor for\nCas9 cleavage in plants (Figure 4C). However, a recentin vitro\nstudy showed that 5′ addition of only two to three unpaired\nnucleotides in SpCas9 gRNA has a signiﬁcant effect on the\ncleavage activity of the RuvC domain (Mullally et al., 2020).\nAnother study reported 5’ end modiﬁcations of gRNA retain\ncleavage activity in mammalian cells, although found some length\neffect (Kocak et al., 2019).\nOn the contrary to the retron approach, we fused 200– 250 bp\ndonor template sequence at the 3′ end of the respective gRNA\nsequence (Figure 1C). As evidenced by our result atALS and Pita\nloci, DSB induction efﬁciency was very high with the gRNA\nextended at 3 ′ end. In terms of the overall NHEJ editing\nefﬁciencies of the randomly chosenALS lines tested, 92% of the\nlines had editing, with 84.6% as monoallelic and 7.7% as biallelic. On\nthe other hand, 76.4% of the tested lines forPita had editing, with\n47% as monoallelic and 29.4% as biallelic. Of the nine lines where\nboth ALS and Pita were sequenced, 55.5% (5) displayed editing in\nboth loci, conﬁrming multiplex editing (Supplementary Table S5).\nThese results indicate a fusion of ~200 nt long sequence at the 3′ end\nof gRNA did not signiﬁcantly impact cleavage efﬁciency in riceALS\nand Pita loci. cgRNAs were also found to be fully functional in\ngenerating DSB in rice in an earlier study (Butt et al., 2017). The\nrecently developed prime editing technique depends on a 3′\nextended guide RNA ( Anzalone et al., 2019 ). Similarly,\nmodiﬁcation of the 3 ′ e n do fg R N Aw a sw e l lt o l e r a t e db y\nSpCas9 in a previous study ( Palumbo et al., 2020 ). Taken\ntogether, our data suggest that both 5′ and 3’ ends of gRNA are\namenable for modiﬁcation without signiﬁcantly affecting the Cas9\ncleavage activity in rice.\nCONCLUSION\nWe demonstrated that the Cas9 repair outcome, speciﬁcally the type\nand fraction of 1 bp insertion, is predictable in the plant system by\nemploying machine learning models. Among the models tested,\ninDelphi outperformed the other two models, FORECasT and\nSPROUT.

Our understanding of the diversity of de-\nfence systems has increased greatly in the last few\nyears, and many more systems likely await discov-\nery. To identify defence-related genes, we recently\ndeveloped the Prokaryotic Antiviral Defence LOCator\n(PADLOC) bioinformatics tool. To increase the acces-\nsibility of PADLOC, we describe here the PADLOC\nweb server (freely available athttps://padloc.otago.\nac.nz), allowing users to analyse whole genomes,\nmetagenomic contigs, plasmids, phages and ar-\nchaeal viruses. The web server includes a more than\n5-fold increase in defence system types detected\n(since the ﬁrst release) and expanded functional-\nity enabling detection of CRISPR arrays and retron\nncRNAs. Here, we provide user information such as\ninput options, description of the multiple outputs,\nlimitations and considerations for interpretation of\nthe results, and guidance for subsequent analyses.\nThe PADLOC web server also houses a precomputed\ndatabase of the defence systems in>230,000 RefSeq\ngenomes. These data reveal two taxa, Campylobac-\nterota and Spriochaetota, with unusual defence sys-\ntem diversity and abundance. Overall, the PADLOC\nweb server provides a convenient and accessible re-\nsource for the detection of antiviral defence systems.\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION\nDiverse antiviral defence systems have evolved in bacteria\nand archaea that defend against infection by their viruses\nand mobile genetic elements. There are over 60 known\nbroad families of defence systems, with more than 20 dis-\ntinct system types discovered in the past five years (precise\ntalliesaredifficultsinceclassificationschemes,suchasclass,\ntype and subtype, vary between families of systems and the\nmechanisms of many systems remain unknown) (1–5). As\nsuch, system discovery has greatly outpaced the develop-\nment of tools that make use of these new insights. To pro-\nvide widespread accessibility to known and newly discov-\nered system types, and ensure consistency between system\nannotations, we recently developed the Prokaryotic Antivi-\nralDefenceLocator(PADLOC)toolasaframeworktosys-\ntematically identify antiviral defence systems (6).

Many of the protein families are\nrepresentedbymultipleHMMs(forexample,therearecur-\nrently 45 HMMs from various sources representing differ-\nent Cas10 clades). Potential matches are filtered to remove\nlow-scoring hits (based on E-value and coverage thresh-\nolds).PADLOCthenusesasetofsystemdefinitionmodels\nto determine whether the genetic synteny requirements are\nmet for each possible system classification (Figure1). This\napproach to multi-gene system identification has been ap-\nplied successfully in the past for the detection of CRISPR-\nCas (7,8) and protein secretion systems (9). In addition to\ndetectingprotein-codinggenes,thePADLOCwebserverin-\ncludesnewfunctionalitytodetectCRISPRarraysandncR-\nNAs,suchasretronmsr-msdelements.Here,wediscussthis\nadded PADLOC functionality, the addition of many new\nsystems to the database, limitations and important consid-\nerations for interpretation of the results, and guidance for\nsubsequent analyses.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpansion of the PADLOC defence system database\nAt its core, the PADLOC web server is based on the PAD-\nLOC command line tool ( https://github.com/padlocbio/\npadloc), with a curated database of profile HMMs, HMM\nscoring thresholds, and system models (https://github.com/\npadlocbio/padloc-db). Our current understanding of de-\nfence system genetics is the result of a collective scientific\neffort, and the HMMs and system models in the PAD-\nLOC database were built and curated using data from\nmany sources. Construction of HMMs for the CBASS and\nDoron systems, plus several variant systems we discovered,\nare as previously described (6). We have since expanded\nthe PADLOC web server database to contain> 180 sys-\ntem definitions, including> 3,500 profile HMMs. Where\nprofile HMMs were made available by the authors of\npapers describing new defence system types (10–12), or\ndatabases and tools to detect subsets of systems (13–15),\nthese HMMs were assigned PADLOC HMM accessions\n(e.g. PLDC12345) and added to the PADLOC database\n(the original HMM names were retained for traceability).\nWheremultiplesequencealignmentswereavailable( 16,17),\nwe realigned the sequences using MUSCLE (18) and built\nHMMs with HMMER3 (19). For cases without HMMs\nor sequence alignments but a list of relevant proteins was\navailable (8,20–39), we either used our sequence clustering\nand HMM generation pipeline described previously (6), or\nalignedthesequenceswithMUSCLE,manuallycuratedthe\nalignments to remove outlier sequences, then built HMMs\nwith HMMER3. In the absence of supplied lists of ho-\nmologs, we used example sequences from experimentally\nverified defence systems as seeds for BLAST searches, then\naligned, curated and built HMMs, as above (22,40–69).\nWhere possible, the data source and appropriate refer-\nence for each HMM is listed in the PADLOC database\nHMM metadata file (hmm meta.txt, available from the\nPADLOC database repository). We encourage PADLOC\nusers to recognize the importance and value of these data\nusedtobuildthePADLOCwebserverbycitingtheoriginal\nsources. Models will continue to be added and updated pe-\nriodically as more defence systems are discovered. We wel-\ncome and encourage submissions of new defence systems,\nincludingHMMs,multiplesequencealignments,orlistsfor\nrelevantproteinsequencesordatabaseaccessions.Similarly,\nfeedback to improve the sensitivity and specificity of PAD-\nLOC, updates to citation links, and suggestions to improve\ndefence system and protein nomenclature will help ensure\nPADLOC remains a useful community resource.\nDetection of non-coding sequences\nSince the command line PADLOC tool detects only\nprotein-coding genes, yet many defence systems con-\ntain non-coding RNAs, we integrated detection of\nCRISPR arrays and retron-associated ncRNAs (msr-\nmsd elements) into the web server. CRISPR arrays are\ndetected with a customized version of CRISPRDetect\n(70) using the arguments: array\nquality score cutoff\n2.5; minimum word repeatation 3; word length 11;\nminimum no of repeats 3; repeat length cutoff 11;\nmax gap between crisprs 250. The resulting crispr.gff\noutput file is supplied to PADLOC using the –crispr input\noption and the human-readable crispr.txt output file is\nmade available for user download. Potential ncRNAs asso-\nciated with retrons are identified by searching a database\nof msr-msd element covariance models (available from the\nPADLOC database repository), against each genome se-\nquence using Infernal’s cmsearch (71) with the arguments:\nZ10;FZ500.TheInfernaloutputisfilteredtoonlyinclude\nhits passing the inclusion threshold (E-value= 0.01), then\nloaded into PADLOC using the –ncrna input option.\nIn specific PADLOC system definition models (e.g. for\nretrons), ncRNAs are listed as ‘ncRNA’ in the core, ac-\ncessory or prohibited gene lists, as required. As such, any\nidentified ncRNAs contribute to the total required gene\ncount for each relevant defence system.\nPrecomputed RefSeq data and pseudogenes\nFor the precomputed PADLOC dataset (currently based\non RefSeq v209 (72)), we used the [assembly]\ngenomic.fna,\n[assembly] genomic.gff and [assembly]protein.faa files for\neach genome assembly from the RefSeq FTP server. First,\nCRISPR arrays and retron-associated ncRNAs were iden-\ntified by running CRISPRDetect and Infernal, respectively\n(as above), with [assembly]\ngenomic.fna as input.

Next, we pre-processed the [as-\nsembly] genomic.gff and [assembly]protein.faa files to al-\nlow increased detection of defence systems containing\npseudogenes. The NCBI prokaryotic genome annotation\npipeline (PGAP) identifies genes that contain frameshifts,\nnonsense stop codons, or appear otherwise incomplete,\nas pseudogenes (73). The coordinates of each pseudogene\nare reported in the [assembly]\ngenomic.gff, but the corre-\nsponding protein sequences are not included in the [assem-\nbly] protein.faa.SincePADLOCreliesonanypotentialde-\nfence system protein sequences to be present in the input\nfile, pseudogenes belonging to defence systems would not\nnormally be identified. The PGAP annotates each pseudo-\ngene with the accession of the full protein sequence used to\ninfertheproductofthepseudogene(e.g.the Bacilluscereus\nVD146assemblyGCF\n000399425.1hasapseudogenewith\nlocus tag IK1RS32735 that is labelled as similar to the\nCRISPR-associated protein Cas4 ofOceanobacillus mas-\nsiliensis WP 010649895.1). Therefore, we substituted the\npseudogenes in each RefSeq genome with the sequence of\ntheirinferentialprotein(whereavailable).Lastly,PADLOC\nwasrunusingthepseudogene-corrected.gffand.faainputs,\nplus the CRISPR array and ncRNA inputs (as above).\nImplementation\nThe core PADLOC tool is implemented in R, with some\ninput handling using Bash and Python (primarily Biopy-\nthon (74)). The PADLOC web server was built using\nthe Django Framework (https://www.djangoproject.com).\nUserjobsareidentifiedbyuniqueandanonymousjobiden-\ntifiers and are not accessible by other users. Users can ac-\ncesstheirresults(trackedusingcookies)untiltheirbrowser\ncookiesarecleared,theresultsareremovedmanuallybythe\nuser, or until they expire (currently after 10 days). On the\nuser side, anonymous job identifiers are replaced with the\nuser-specificjobnameandoutputfilesdownloadedarepre-\nfixed by the job name. When input filesare uploaded to the\nserver, a pre-processing script is used to detect the source\nformat of the files and convert these to the default inputs\nfor PADLOC (.gff and .faa with RefSeq formatting). For\nexample, RAST formatted Genbank files are identified by\nthe presence of the string ‘rasttk’, next the ‘db\nxref’ field is\nchanged to ‘locustag’, finally Biopython is used to output\nPADLOC-compatibleinputfiles.PADLOCalsocontainsa\n‘–fix-prodigal’ option to natively parse Prodigal-formatted\n.gff and .faa file pairs, which the pre-processing script de-\ntects by searching for the string ‘Prodigal’ in the uploaded\n.gff file. Although the command line version of PADLOC\nincludesawrapperforgene-callingwithProdigal(allowing\ninputofunannotatednucleotidesequences),thewebserver\nrunsProdigalduringthepre-processingstage,allowingdif-\nferent gene-calling settings to be used for inputs> 100\nkb, versus shorter sequences (see the Prodigal documenta-\ntion of an explanation of the rationale behind this). For\nusers wanting to analyse unannotated plasmid sequences,\nwe recommend including the host genome sequence within\na multi-fasta input file before uploading to the PADLOC\nweb server (to improve the quality of gene predictions with\nProdigal). Once PADLOC is run, the output is passed to a\npost-processing script that reformats and outputs the data\nin a custom machine-readable format that is used to gener-\nateaninteractivegenomeannotationdisplay(producedus-\ning d3.js (https://d3js.org/)) on the corresponding user-job\nresult page.\nRESULTS\nInput and file handling\nUsers can analyse archaea, bacteria, metagenome, phage,\narchaeal virus and plasmid genome files from the ‘Run\nPADLOC’ page. The PADLOC web server accepts Gen-\nBank flat files, nucleotide FASTA, or paired amino acid\nFASTA and general feature format (GFF3) files as input\n(Figure2A). If a GenBank file is provided, nucleotide, pro-\ntein, and feature information (e.g. gene locations) is ex-\ntracted using Biopython. If a nucleotide FASTA file is pro-\nvided, Prodigal (75) is used to predict open reading frames\nand produce a protein FASTA and GFF3 file. For the best\nquality results, it is recommended that users supply a Gen-\nBankfileoraminoacidFASTAandGFF3filewherecoding\nsequences have already been called and verified (e.g. with\nProdigal or Prokka). Users may wish to download the ex-\nample genome files to see the expected formatting for each\nfile type (Figure2B). When nucleotide information is pro-\nvided,eitherthroughaGenBankornucleotideFASTAfile,\nInfernal (71) is used to detect the ncRNA components of\nretrons. Users also have the option to run CRISPRDetect\nW544 NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,WebServerissue\nFigure 2.The PADLOC web server pipeline and results.

If the job failed, a link is pro-\nvided to download the corresponding log file. The most\ncommon reason for a failed job is incorrect input format-\nting. For successful jobs, individual result pages contain\ninformation about interpreting the output, an interactive\nview of the locus structure of each detected defence sys-\ntem(Figure 2D),asummarytableofsystemsdetected(Fig-\nure 2E), and options to download the output files (Fig-\nure 2F). The main PADLOC output file (.csv format) lists\nall systems identified, with one gene per row. The file con-\ntainsinformationregardingthetypeofsystemdetected,the\nproteins present, their location in the genome, and details\nabouttheconfidenceofdetection.Themostimportantval-\nues to consider when evaluating detection confidence are\nthefullsequenceanddomainE-values(full.seq.E.valueand\ndomain.iE.value),andthetargetandHMMcoverages(tar-\nget.coverageandhmm.coverage).Usually,hitswithlargeE-\nvalues(indicatinglowstatisticalsignificance)andlowcover-\nages should be treated with caution. In general, multi-gene\nNucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,WebServerissue W545\ndefence systems are detected with greater specificity than\nsystems encoded by singe genes.\nConsiderations and limitations\nAswithanycomputationalapproachtoinferringgenefunc-\ntion,thereareseveralpotentiallimitationsthatusersshould\nconsider when interpreting PADLOC web server outputs.\nMany defence proteins contain ubiquitous domains and\ntheirHMMsaremorelikelytodetectspurioushits.Forex-\nample, PtuA (Septu), several retron proteins and Old nu-\ncleases contain similar ATPase domains (11). As a result,\nPADLOC sometimes reports overlapping system classifi-\ncations (typically less than 1% of results), which should\nbe resolved via subjective evaluation of the reported scor-\ning parameters and genetic context. For multi-gene sys-\ntems, the synteny requirements resolve many ambiguities\nand increase the confidence of system classification (due to\nthe reduced probability of two adjacent false-positive hits).\nBy contrast, identification of single-gene systems is more\nchallenging and requires trade-offs with the HMM scoring\ncut-offs(E-valueandHMM /targetcoveragethresholds)to\nachieve an acceptable balance between sensitivity versus\nspecificity. As such, false positive and negative results are\ninevitablymorefrequentforsinglegenesystems.Ingeneral,\nthe PADLOC scoring thresholds are set more toward sen-\nsitivity, with the intention that users interested in further\nstudy of identified potential defence system homologs will\nundertake additional analyses.\nAs a first step to curating PADLOC results, inspection\nof the HMM and target alignment coverage scores can re-\nveal potential false-positive classifications (Figure3A–C).\nIn some cases, very similar proteins differ in function due\nto the presence or absence of enzymatic sites or functional\nmotifs (Figure3D). We encourage users to explore subse-\nquentdomain-basedanalysesofdefencesystemproteinsus-\ning tools such as HHpred (76) to identify protein domains\nwith more granularity. We have also found structure pre-\ndiction tools such as AlphaFold2 (77) and ColabFold (78),\nuseful in identifying domain folds and boundaries. Once\ndemarcated, predicted domain structures can be searched\nagainst protein structure databases such as the PDB (79)\nor AlphaFold-based databases, using tools like DALI (80)\nor Foldseek (81). In many cases, this structure-based ap-\nproach reveals homologs with characterised active sites or\nfunctional motifs, which can aid in discrimination between\ndefence system proteins and similar non-orthologous pro-\nteins. Users may also find it informative to compare their\nPADLOCresultswithDefenseFinder,anothertoolrecently\ndeveloped for defence system identification (82,83).\nThe similarity of several defence systems to other molec-\nular systems inevitably leads to a background rate of false-\npositive system identifications. For example, Wadjet sys-\ntemsaresimilartoMukstructuralmaintenanceofchromo-\nsomes (SMC) systems (21,84,85)( F i g u r e3E). The canoni-\ncalWadjetsystemcomprisesfourproteinsJetABCD,where\nJetA, JetB, and JetC share similarity with MukF, MukE,\nand MukB, respectively. The PADLOC Wadjet system def-\ninitionrequiresthefullJetABCDsettobepresent,whereas\nthe MukFEB cases are reported as part of Wadjet ‘other’\nsystems. Several ‘[system]\nother’ models (which generally\nrequireonlytwocomponentsofasystemtobeco-localised)\nare run alongside the stricter canonical system definitions,\nto enable identification of systems that might otherwise be\noverlooked due to their being split by contig boundaries\n(particularly in metagenomes) (Figure3F), fragmented by\nmultiple intervening genes (e.g. due to MGE insertions),\ngenes missing due to sequencing, assembly or gene-calling\nerrors, mutations, or high sequence divergence of some de-\nfence proteins (Figure3G). For the precomputed RefSeq\ndata,wesubstitutedpseudogeneproductswithsimilarfull-\nlength protein sequences, which allows higher-confidence\nassignment of the example system as Wadjet type I (Figure\n3H). The identification of defence system pseudogenes will\nalso be helpful for studies of defence system evolution and\nturnover.Forsomesystems,suchastheDndandPbephos-\nphorothioation systems, several genes are relatively short\n(includingdndE,pbeB/D)andareoftenmissedbygenepre-\ndiction tools (33,35). The ‘PT\nother’ model will detect the\nremaining genes and users should then manually check for\nshort coding sequences in the vicinity of the expected loca-\ntion of any absent genes. Lastly, several system definition\nmodels specify ‘optional’ genes (e.g. ‘cas\nassociated’ pro-\nteins) that are not necessarily functionally associated with\nthe system. In some cases, these proteins may be unchar-\nacterised independentbona fidedefence systems, or might\nhave non-defence functions. To guide users in interpreting\nresults for ‘other’ models and resolving ambiguities, each\n‘Results’pageonthePADLOCwebservercontainsalistof\nknown potential ambiguities.\nThe current snapshot of antiviral defence systems\nTo provide a current and comprehensive quantitative view\nof the defence systems in bacteria and archaea, we used\nPADLOC to search all RefSeq v209 Bacteria and Archaea\ngenomes. These results are available for browsing on the\nPADLOC web server under the ‘RefSeq results’ page and\nwill be updated periodically with new RefSeq versions and\nas new defence systems are discovered. Overall, the distri-\nbution of different defence systems across different bac-\nteria and archaea is highly varied (Supplementary Figure\nS1). It should be noted that this analysis includes assem-\nblies of varied completeness, and systems may be under-\nrepresented in taxa with incomplete genomes. Clear differ-\nences in the diversity and abundance of defence systems\nwere apparent between phyla (Figure4A), with several no-\ntable outliers including Chlamydiota (very few known de-\nfence systems) and Cyanobacteria (many types of defence\nsystems in high abundance). Campylobacterota had a sig-\nnificant bimodal distribution of defence system abundance\n(Hartigan’s dip test (86), P < 0.001), which relates to the\nHelicobacteraceae relying on a remarkably large number\nof restriction modification systems in each strain (Figure\n4B,C)(87,88).AnotherinterestingphylawasSpirochaetota,\nwhichhadasignificantbimodaldistributionofdefencesys-\ntem diversity due toBorreliaceaehaving very few types of\ndefence systems (Hartigan’s dip test (86), P< 0.001) (Fig-\nure 4D).

(B) Users should be wary of cases where only part of the HMM aligns to the target protein, which\nmay lack a domain important for function of defence system homologs.

(G) Pseudogenes within multi-gene systems are not detected by the default PADLOC workflow,\nso users should check [system]other models for the potential presence of additional genes. In this example, a frameshift withinjetC means the Wadjet\nsystem criteria are not fulfilled (because JetC was not detected) (H) In the precomputed PADLOC RefSeq dataset, pseudogenes were substituted with the\nprotein homologs inferred by the PGAP pipeline, allowing the above example to be classified as a Wadjet Type I system.

It remains to be resolved\nwhether the low defence diversity is driven by genome re-\nduction and due to less exposure to phages and MGEs\nthan free-living relatives. Overall, these examples illustrate\nthat the PADLOC web server can be used to interrogate\nhypotheses such as these and to then identify candidate\ntaxaandstrainsinwhichpredictionscanbeexperimentally\ntested.\nDISCUSSION\nToaddressthelackofcapableandaccessibletoolsforcom-\nprehensive defence system identification, we developed the\nPADLOC web server.

Evaluating the ac-\ncuracy of detection and adjusting these thresholds accord-\ninglyisdifficultwhenonlyafewexperimentallyverifiedex-\namples are available, as is currently the case with most de-\nfence systems. PADLOC provides a key initial step for fur-\ntherimprovement,byfacilitatingtheidentificationofmany\nputative systems that can be followed up by functional in-\nvestigation. Feedback and contribution to PADLOC and\nthe web server is encouraged via the GitHub repository\n(https://github.com/padlocbio/padloc/issues),includingbut\nnot limited to the addition of systems and HMMs, sugges-\ntions for adjusting thresholds or system classifications and\nnomenclature, and reporting bugs.\nThe comprehensive identification of many systems made\npossiblewithPADLOCalsoopensavenuesforinvestigating\nmany interesting biological questions. For example, many\nputative defence system genes are annotated as pseudo-\ngenes. Although pseudogenes can arise from sequencing or\nassemblyerrors,theymightalsoincludetheremnantsofde-\nfence systems that have become inactivated through muta-\ntion. Investigation of these remnants could provide insight\ninto the ancestry and evolution of defence system arsenals\nthat would otherwise remain undetected. In addition, our\nbroad taxonomic analyses revealed notable differences in\nthe diversity and abundance of defence systems in many\ntaxa, raising the question of what factors drive the require-\nment for more defence against phages, and whether differ-\nences are driven by ecological factors such as phage diver-\nsity and encounter rates (reviewed in92).

Introduction\nGenome editing technologies have proven to be invaluable molec-\nular tools, enabling rapid advances in functional genomics, \nmetabolic engineering, therapeutics development, bioremedia-\ntion and more (1–4). Traditional methods for genome editing \nuse allelic exchange via the RecA-dependent process of homol-\nogous recombination (HR). In HR, circular or linear DNA sub-\nstrates, encoding the desired modification flanked by targeted \nregions of homology, are introduced into recombination-proficient \n(\nΔrecBCΔsbcBC or ΔrecD) cells ( 5, 6). Endogenous recombination \nproteins facilitate crossover between the editing template and the \ntarget locus, incorporating the desired mutations into the host \nchromosome. While this process is useful for targeted mutage-\nnesis, it is sometimes inefficient and always laborious, requiring \nnumerous cloning steps to incorporate sizable regions of homol-\nogy (0.5–5 kb) and extensive screening to identify recombinant \ncells (7).\nThe development of in vivo recombination-mediated engineer-\ning (recombineering), which relies on phage-derived proteins to \nfacilitate DNA integration, has greatly improved the speed and \nefficiency with which targeted mutations can be made. For exam-\nple, the λ\n-phage-derived Red system in Escherichia coli yields more \nthan a 100-fold increase in recombinant cells over traditional HR \nthrough a process independent of RecA ( 8, 9). Recombineering \nreduces editing template design constraints by enabling efficient \nrecombination with homology arms of <50 bp on double-stranded \nDNA (10). In addition, short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonu-\ncleotides (oligos) can be used as suitable recombineering sub-\nstrates. In fact, ssDNA oligos have produced recombinant cells \nwith just one of the three λ-Red proteins, the ssDNA-annealing \nprotein Beta, further simplifying the requirements for success-\nful recombineering ( 9). Furthermore, the Clustered Regularly \nInterspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 bacterial \nimmune system has been adapted as a programmable counter-\nselection tool to selectively target and kill unedited cells after \nrecombineering. This technique enhances the apparent efficiency \nby increasing the mutant to wild-type ratio of the population, \nallowing highly efficient scarless genome editing (11–14). Addi-\ntional efforts for the improvement of λ-Red editing efficiency \nha\nve used engineered mutator strains, where the overexpres-\nsion of HR-involved enzymes, the deletion of host exonucle-\nases and/or disabling the mismatch repair system significantly \nimprove recombination efficiency but can unintentionally lead to \nthe accumulation of off-target mutations (15–17).\nFarzadfard and Lu (18) described a novel approach for recom-\nbineering, termed Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biolog-\nical Events (SCRIBE), where the ssDNA is generated in vivo and \nthen incorporated into the chromosome. The in vivo ssDNA is pro-\nduced by the Ec86 retron of E. coli BL21, composed of the msr \nand msd RNA elements and the reverse transcriptase (RT). Upon \ntranscription of the msr–msd sequence, inverted repeats flanking \nthe msr–msd RNA form a secondary structure specifically recog-\nnized by the RT and the msdRNA is reverse transcribed to ssDNA. \nSimultaneous expression of bet on the SCRIBE plasmid allows \nfor efficient recombination of the newly synthesized ssDNA into \nthe lagging strand of the targeted locus during DNA replication \n(Figure 1A). By placing control of this system under an inducible \npr\nomoter, the cells record their exposure to the inducer as the frac-\ntion of cells with the msd encoded mutation. By simply changing \nthe msd sequence, SCRIBE can be easily retargeted to modify any \ndesired genomic site. The authors report a maximum efficiency for \nSCRIBE of 10–4 recombinants per generation (18). While sufficient \nfor making mutations conferring easily selectable phenotypes, \nthis rate of recombination is not robust enough to obviate the need \nfor extensive screening when making nonselectable edits (19).\nFarzadfard et al. (20) improve upon their original SCRIBE design \nto \nachieve highly efficient ssDNA recombineering via transient \nknockdown of host exonuclease expression through CRISPR inter-\nference (CRISPRi), reporting nearly 100% recombination efficiency \nfor one of their chosen targets. Additionally, the authors demon-\nstrate that SCRIBE enables the incorporation of multiple muta-\ntions at distinct loci (18, 20). However, with no easy method \nfor plasmid curing, doing so requires that each editing plasmid \ncontain a unique selection marker for plasmid maintenance, a \nstrategy limited by the number of orthogonal selection markers \nand compatible plasmid origins available.\nIn this work, we sought to enable iterative genome editing \nby moving the functional components to easily curable plas-\nmids while maintaining the SCRIBE system’s high recombination \nefficiency. We hypothesized that combining an improved SCRIBE \nsystem with Cas9 counterselection against wild-type cells would \nprovide an easy-to-use genome editing platform that precluded \nthe need to electroporate ssDNA for recombineering. In addition, \nthe system was designed so that the editing plasmid can be retar-\ngeted through a single round of PCR amplification and cloning \nto reduce construction times and enable the rapid generation of \nmultilocus mutants.\n2.

Briefly, primers with overhangs encod-\ning the new target sequence were used to PCR amplify the vector \nusing Q5 High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs, NEB), \nfollowed by DpnI digestion to remove template DNA, agarose gel \nelectrophoresis to verify amplicon size and column-based DNA \ncleanup. DNA fragments were then assembled using the 2x NEB-\nuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB) with the following \nmodifications: 1 μl Master Mix + 0.5 μl each DNA fragment, incu-\nbated \nat 50 ∘C for 15 min. Chemically competent E. coli NEB5α\ncells were used for cloning. Antibiotics were used at the following \nconcentrations unless otherwise noted: spectinomycin (50μg/ml), \nkanamycin (50 μ\ng/ml), chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml), rifampicin \n(20 μg/ml), tetracycline (20 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (100 μ g/ml). \nThe tetA gene was PCR amplified from pUC18-mini-Tn7T-Gm-\nTetAR using primers 2490 and 2491 and integrated into E. coli\nMG1655 using λ-Red recombination with pKD46 (21), creating the \nMG1655 yhiS::tetAR strain.\n2.2 Recombineering assays and recombination \nefficiency determination\nSince the number of recombinant cells should increase with \ntime, all experiments were performed in freshly transformed cells. \nApproximately 100 ng of editing plasmid was transformed into \ncompetent E. coli cells via either heat shock at 42 ∘C or electropo-\nration in a 0.1-cm gap cuvette with a single 1.8-kV pulse. Cells \nwere recovered in 1 ml SOB at 30 ∘C for 2 h and then outgrown \novernight at 30 ∘C in 5 ml Luria Bertani (LB) broth + appropriate \nantibiotic(s) to select transformants. The total number of viable \ncells was determined by spotting 10 μl 10-fold serially diluted \no\nvernight cultures on LB plates+ appropriate antibiotic(s). For the \nrpoB and tetR assays, 10μL of 10-fold serially diluted overnight cul-\ntur\nes were spotted on LB plates with rifampicin or tetracycline to \ndetermine the number of recombinant cells. For the ackA assays, \n1 ml of cells from overnight cultures were pelleted, washed and \nresuspended with sterile phosphate buffered saline after which \nwashed cells were spotted on M9 chloroacetate plates (M9 min-\nimal media + 10 mM sodium chloroacetate + 2% glycerol + 0.1% \nSOB) to determine the number of ackA mutant cells. Recom-\nbination efficiency was determined by dividing the number of \nrecombinant cells by the total number of viable transformants. \nEfficiencies reported are the mean and standard error for three \nindependent replicates. For the rpoB experiments, spontaneous \nrifampicin resistance was assessed for the wild-type strain as \ndescribed in Section 2.6 below and the spontaneous mutation \nrate was subtracted from all samples plated on rifampicin. All \nstatistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 \nprogram.\n2.3 Promoter optimization\nThe P lacO promoter of the Ec86 retron cassette in pTLlSc-rpoB \nwas replaced with P J23101, and P VanCC was inserted upstream of \nbet as described in Supplementary Table S2. Expression of the \nEc86 retron cassette and beta recombinase by P J23101 and P VanCC, \nrespectively, was further optimized by PCR amplifying pTJVSc-\nrpoB with primers 2326 & 2358 and 2325 & 2359, followed by \nassembly of the two resulting amplicons using the 2x NEBuilder \nHiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB). The assembled pTJVSc-\nrpoB promoter library was transformed into E. coli NEB5α cells, \nand recombination efficiency was determined. In addition, the \nremainder of the pTJVSc-rpoB culture was diluted 1:100 into 5 ml \nLB broth + rifampicin and grown overnight again at 30∘C. The fol-\nlowing morning, the plasmid library was extracted, retransformed \ninto E. coli NEB5α cells, and the process was repeated three more \ntimes. After the fourth round of selection, the pTJVSc-rpoB plas-\nmid was extracted from four randomly chosen transformants and \nthe PJ23101 and PVanCC promoters were sequenced with primers 746 \nand 2252, respectively, to assess the convergence of the population \non a single optimal promoter sequence, yielding pTJV1Sc-rpoB as \nindicated in Supplementary Table S2.\n2.4 Cas9 counterselection\nFor pCas9CR4 for CRISPR/Cas9 directed counterselection against \nunedited wild-type cells, transformants with editing plasmid \nwere outgrown overnight. The following morning cultures were \ndiluted 1:10 into LB + appropriate antibiotics with or without \nanhydrotetracycline (aTc; 0.1 μ\ng/ml) to induce Cas9 expression \nand then grown overnight at 30 ∘C. Serial dilutions were spotted \nonto LB + rifampicin for the rpoB assays, LB + tetracycline for the \ntetA reversion assays, or M9 chloroacetate for the ackA assays, \nthen incubated overnight at 37∘C. The efficiency of Cas9 counters-\nelection was determined by dividing the number of colonies from \nthe aTc-induced cultures that grew with selection by the total \nnumber of viable cells plated on a nonselective plate. Results are \nreported as the mean with standard error for three independent \nreplicates.\n2.5 Efficiency improvement with negative \nmutator alleles\nThe mutL gene was cloned into pCas9CR4 as described in \nSupplementary Table S2. The cymR repressor and PcymRC promoter \n(22) were inserted upstream of mutL to allow for inducible \nexpression by the addition of cumate, yielding pCas9CyMutL. \nEscherichia coli MG1655 cells harboring pCas9CyMutL were then \ntransformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB1 or pTJV1Sc-tetA and recovered \nin 1 ml SOB at 30 ∘C for 2 h, after which cells were transferred \nto 5 ml LB + chloramphenicol + spectinomycin with or without \ncumate (100 μM) and outgrown overnight at 30 ∘C\n . Cultures were \ndiluted 1:10 into LB+ chloramphenicol + spectinomycin + cumate \nwith or without aTc (0.1 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 30 ∘C . \nRecombination efficiency and efficiency of Cas9 counterselec-\ntion were determined the following day, and the results are \nreported as the mean with standard error for three independent\nreplicates.\n2.6 Off-target mutation frequency analysis\nEscherichia coli MG1655 was separately transformed with pTV1β-\nrpoB and pCas9CyMutL and plated on LB + spectinomycin and \nLB + chloramphenicol, respectively, for the selection of transfor-\nmants. Single colonies from each transformation were used to \ninoculate 5 ml LB broth + appropriate antibiotic in triplicate and \ngrown overnight at 30∘C, with pCas9CyMutL grown with or with-\nout cumate (100 μM). Cultures were then diluted 1:10 into the \nsame \nmedia and grown for an additional overnight at 30 ∘C, after \nwhich 10 μL of 10-fold serial dilutions of each were spotted onto \nLB only and LB + rifampicin to assess the spontaneous mutation \nfrequency.\nFor genome sequencing, a single colony from each transforma-\ntion and wild-type MG1655 were grown in LB broth + appropriate \nantibiotic overnight at 30 ∘C, with pCas9CyMutL grown with and \nwithout cumate (100 μM) for induction of mutL expr ession. Cul-\ntures were then diluted 1:100, grown overnight and repeated \nfor a total of two setbacks. Genomic DNA was extracted after \nthe first setback for wild-type and after the second setback for \nthe other samples using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide \n(CTAB)/phenol-chloroform extraction protocol (23).\nSamples were prepared for whole-genome sequencing using \nthe NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). \nSequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 sequencing \nplatform (Novogene Co. Sacramento, CA). Sequencing data were \nquality filtered and adapters were trimmed using the Trim Galore \nscript (24). Mutations were identified using the Breseq mutational \nanalysis pipeline (25) set to polymorphism mode with the default \nparameters and a minimum coverage cutoff of 20× reads. The E. \ncoli MG1655 reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology \nInformation (NCBI) accession: NC_000913) was used as the refer-\nence sequence. The wild-type MG1655 parent strain was used as \na control to assess differences between the reference genome and \nour lab strain and sequence variations identified were subtracted \nfrom those found in our experimental samples.\n3. Results\n3.1 Improvement of recombineering with \nreverse-transcribed ssDNA\nTo enable an efficient and iterative system for genome editing \nwith ssDNA reverse-transcribed in vivo, we moved the SCRIBE sys-\ntem’s functional components to the pKDsgRNA plasmid that has \nthe temperature-sensitive variant of the pSC101 origin to allow \nfor easy curing with growth at 37–42 ∘C ( 21, 26, 27). This plas-\nmid, pTLlSc, possesses the msr-msd coding sequence and Ec86 RT \nfor the synthesis of ssDNA, the bet gene to facilitate incorpora-\ntion of the ssDNA and the S. pyogenes single-guide RNA (sgRNA) \nto enable Cas9 targeting. The judicious design of this plasmid \nFigure 1. Optimization of the origin of replication and promoter elements enables an efficient and curable system for in vivo recombineering .\n(A) In vivo retron-generated ssDNA serves as an editing substrate for beta recombination at the lagging strand of the replication fork. (B) Rifampicin \nr\nesistance conferred by the P564L mutation of the rpoB gene was used to measure the recombination efficiency. The pSC101 origin of replication allows \nfor curing of the editing plasmid by growth at 42∘C after desired mutation(s) are made. (C) Modifications made to promoters and origin of replication \nfor enhanced recombination efficiency and curability. (D) Recombination efficiency of each editing plasmid reported as the average of three \nindependent replicates. Error bars represent SEM, and statistical significance relative to pFF745–rpoB is denoted by asterisks (ns= not significant; \n**P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test of log-transformed values).\nenables easy one-step cloning to retarget both the msd and sgRNA \n(Supplementary Figure S2). To assess the recombination efficiency \nusing an easily selectable mutation, the msr-msd was retargeted to \nintroduce three consecutive nucleotide substitutions and create \nthe P564L point mutation of rpoB that confers rifampicin resis-\ntance (Figure 1B). Here, we define recombination efficiency as the \nnumber of cells obtained on selective media divided by the total \nnumber of viable cells. First, we compared the efficiency of pFF745, \ndescribed by Farzadfard et al., which possesses a high-copy pUC \norigin targeted to rpoB, with our temperature-sensitive plasmid \npTLlSc-rpoB. As expected, recombination efficiency was about \n100-fold lower with the temperature-sensitive plasmid, presum-\nably because of decreased expression of the retron elements and \nbet compared to the high-copy pUC origin on pFF745 (Figure 1D). \nWe sought to improve this efficiency by increasing the transcrip-\ntion of the msr-msd, RT and bet through promoter replacements. \nThe strong constitutive promoter P J23101 ( 28) replaced the P lacO\npromoter driving expression of the msr-msd RNA and RT. The \npromoter of bet was changed to P VanCC ( 22) because it is both \nstr\nong and nonhomologous to P J23101. Replacing these promoters \nindividually did not increase recombination efficiency, but when \ncombined, efficiency increased nearly 10-fold (Figure 1D).\nTo further increase recombination efficiency, we used a selec-\ntion strategy where a library of variant plasmids was created by \ncloning degeneracies into both the P J23101 and P VanCC promoters. \nWe hypothesized that variants with increased efficiency would \novertake the population after repeated rounds of outgrowth, selec-\ntion, plasmid extraction and re-transformation (Supplementary \nFigure S1A). After four passages, the efficiency of the evolved pool \nwas slightly higher than the original construct (Supplementary \nFigure S1B), and sequencing of the promoter from randomly cho-\nsen transformants revealed a convergence of the pool toward a \nsingle promoter sequence that had a recombination efficiency \nof nearly 10-fold greater than the parent plasmid (Supplemen-\ntary Figure S1C–D). Moreover, the efficiency of the improved con-\nstruct, pTJV1Sc-rpoB, was similar to the original SCRIBE plasmid, \npFF745–rpoB (Figure 1D).\n3.2 CRISPR/Cas9 counterselection against \nwild-type cells\nWe next investigated whether our improved in vivo recombi-\nneering system could be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 counter-\nselection against wild-type cells for a highly efficient genome \nediting system. The pCas9CR4 plasmid has cas9 under the con-\ntrol of an inducible P tet promoter that was engineered to enable \nco-maintenance with a genome targeting sgRNA until induc-\ntion with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) (27). We first transformed \npCas9CR4 into the E. coli strains NEB5α, BL21-DE3 and MG1655, \nand \nsubsequently transformed the pTJV1Sc-rpoB editing vector, \nwhich possessed an sgRNA targeted to wild-type rpoB. After recov-\nery\n, the cells were transferred to LB broth with spectinomycin \nand chloramphenicol to select for both plasmids and grown \novernight. The following morning, the cultures were then passed \ninto media with or without aTc and grown an additional overnight \nfor induction of Cas9 expression and killing of unedited cells. \nCells were then spotted onto plates with and without rifampicin \nto directly select for the rpoB mutation and assess total viable \ncells, respectively (Figure 2A). The recombination efficiency was \nFigure 2. Targeted counterselection against unedited cells by inducible cas9 expression. (A) After Beta-recombination, cells are sub-cultured 1:10 into \nmedia with aTc to induce cas9 expression from pCasCR4. Constitutive expression of an sgRNA from pTJV1Sc-rpoB targets rpoBWT alleles for DNA DSB \nby Cas9 cleavage, thereby eliminating nonmutated cells. (B) Escherichia coli NEB5α, BL21 and MG1655 cells were transformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB and \nthe RpoBP564L fr\nequencies were determined by plating on LB+ rifampicin. (C) Escherichia coli MG1655::tetAR was transformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB, \npTJV1Sc-tetA and pTJV1Sc-ackA. Frequencies of the RpoBP564L, TetA*70Y and AckAE54* mutations were determined by plating cells on LB+ rifampicin, \ntetracycline and chloroacetate, respectively. (D) Sequential mutation of distinct loci was performed by transforming E. coli MG1655 with pTJV1Sc-rpoB, \ndetermining recombination efficiency by plating on LB+ rifampicin, curing pTJV1Sc-rpoB by growing cells at 42∘C, then transforming once more with \npTJV1Sc-ackA. Double mutant frequency was assessed by plating on LB+ rifampicin + sodium chloroacetate. Averages are based on three independent \nreplicates. Error bars represent SEM. Statistical significance is denoted by asterisks (**= P-value < 0.01; ***= P-value <0.001; two-tailed Student’s t-test of \nlog-transformed values).\nbetween 1 × 10–5 and 3 × 10–3 without induction of Cas9 expression \nfor all three strains. However, when cas9 was induced, the average \nefficiency was ∼5% for BL21 and 60–80% for NEB5 α and MG1655, \nindicating a substantial r\neduction in wild-type cells (Figure 2B).\nT\no demonstrate that our system could mutagenize different \ntargets, we examined the recombination efficiency of tetA and \nackA. We inserted the tetA encoded tetracycline efflux pump that \npossessed a premature stop codon of about 200 bp from the \nstart codon into MG1655 using traditional λ-Red recombineering \n(21). Our experiments then mutated the stop codon back to a \nsense \ncodon, creating the TetA *70Y mutation to enable the full-\nlength translation of tetA and confer tetracycline resistance to the \ncells. We obtained tetracycline-resistant colonies with efficiencies \nof 5.4 × 10 –4 and 1.8 × 10 –5 with and without Cas9 counterse-\nlection, respectively, much lower than those observed for rpoB\n(Figure 2C). Next, the acetate kinase gene, ac\n kA, was mutated \nwith three nucleotide point mutations to create a premature stop \ncodon (AckAE54*) so that the cells are unable to metabolize acetate \nand are thus resistant to the toxic acetate analog chloroacetate. \nA recombination efficiency of 5.6% without Cas9 counterselec-\ntion and over 100% with induction of Cas9 was obtained, as \nslightly more colonies were observed on the selection plate than \non the nonselective plate on average (Figure 2C). These experi-\nments show that targeted counterselection of unedited cells with \nCas9 can successfully enrich for recombinants across distinct loci.\nThe pCas9CR4 plasmid used in these experiments was \ndesigned for tight repression of cas9 and an ssrA degradation tag \ndecreases Cas9 stability, enabling co-maintenance of both genome \ntargeting sgRNA template and cas9 on two plasmids. Although \ninduction of cas9 is required for cell death by double-strand break \n(DSB), we questioned whether some transient level of Cas9 expres-\nsion also enriches for recombinants, thus we performed exper-\niments to compare the number of mutants obtained with the \nSCRIBE system in the presence and absence of pCas9CR4. More \nrecombinant cells were produced for all three targets with cells \nharboring pCas9CR4 than cells without, even without induction \nof cas9 expression (Figure 2C). In fact, we were unable to obtain \ntetr\nacycline-resistant cells when using the pTJV1Sc-tetA plasmid \nalone. These results suggest that even low levels of cas9 expres-\nsion in the uninduced state can increase recombination efficiency \npossibly by slowing the growth of wild-type cells that must repair \nDSB or because this low-level DSB stimulates recombination.\nThe proposed mechanism of ssDNA recombineering asserts \nthat allelic replacement occurs at the replication fork, where \nthe supplied ssDNA replaces an Okazaki fragment on the lag-\nging strand. This mechanism results in a lagging strand bias, \nwhere recombination efficiencies for oligos targeting the lagging \nstrand are higher than those targeting the leading strand. To \nassess whether in vivo produced ssDNA proceeds through the \nsame mechanism, we targeted the leading strand of rpoB for edit-\ning (Supplementary Figure S3A). Surprisingly, this resulted in a \nsimilar efficiency as targeting the lagging strand (Supplementary \nFigure S3B). We wondered whether this was a function of the in \nvivo generation of ssDNA or if the same would be true of the rpoB\ntarget using traditional λ-Red recombineering. We constructed a \ncontr\nol plasmid in which the msr-msd and RT coding sequences \nwere removed (pTV1β-rpoB), resulting in constitutive expression \nof \nBeta only and sgRNA targeting rpoB. We then performed a tra-\nditional recombineering experiment by transforming exogenous \nssDNA into cells with this plasmid and pCas9CR4 and observed \nthat the lagging oligo was much more efficient, consistent with \nprevious observations (7, 9, 29) and the proposed mechanism of \nssDN\nA recombineering (Supplementary Figure S3C ). To evaluate \nwhether the same phenomenon is true of other targets using \nSCRIBE, we targeted the leading strand of tetA with the in vivo sys-\ntem (Supplementary Figure S3A). In this case, over 1000-fold fewer \nrecombinant cells were obtained than when targeting the lagging \nstrand (Supplementary Figure S3D). While we suspect that recom-\nbineering with in vivo ssDNA occurs at the lagging strand of the \nreplication fork, our data suggest that the constant availability \nof ssDNA may be sufficient to overcome the lagging strand bias \nin some cases or that an alternative mechanism may influence \nrecombination rates at some locations.\n3.3 Iterative mutagenesis of two targets\nAbove all, the high efficiency of mutagenesis found at our target \nsites confirms a robust system for genome editing, precluding the \nneed to screen large numbers of colonies to identify mutants. To \ndemonstrate that our system could iteratively construct genome \nmodifications, cells that were mutated at the rpoB locus were \ngrown at 42∘C to cure the cells of pTJV1Sc-rpoB. Subsequent trans-\nformation with pTJV1Sc-ackA enabled mutation of the ackA gene \nand produced cells resistant to both rifampicin and chloroacetate \n(Figure 2D). Amplification and Sanger sequencing of the rpoB and \nac\nkA loci showed that both intended mutations were made, con-\nfirming that iterative use of the system could edit multiple loci \nindependently (Supplementary Figure S4).\n3.4 Co-Expression of dominant-negative mutL\nRecombineering with ssDNA results in transient production of \nheteroduplex DNA that the methyl-directed mismatch repair \n(MMR) system can repair, thus decreasing the observed rate of \nmutagenesis. Several strategies are known to decrease the rate of \nMMR and enable more efficient mutagenesis (15, 17, 30–\n32). For \nexample, single bp mismatches are repaired with different effi-\nciencies, while C:C mismatches evade repair entirely and prevent \nrepair of mismatches within 3 bp (17, 31). The introduction of \nseveral adjacent mismatches also prevents repair by MMR (15). \nHowever, these strategies present design constraints that can-\nnot always be followed. An alternate strategy is the recombinant \nexpression of negative mutS or mutL variants that are dominant \nover wild-type enzymes and prevent efficient repair (32). Accord-\ningly, we cloned mutL with the dominant negative E32K muta-\ntion into the pCas9CR4 plasmid under the control of a cumate \ninducible promoter (22) to maintain a two-plasmid system with \nindependent control of cas9 and mutL (Figure 3A). To test this sys-\ntem, \nwe introduced a single bp mismatch of A:C in rpoB with \nand without induction of the negative mutL. In cells harboring \npCas9CyMutL \nwith mutL in the off-state, the average frequency \nof rifampicin-resistant mutants was 4.9 × 10 –6 without Cas9-\ninduction and 4.5 × 10 –4 with Cas9 counterselection ( Figure 3B). \nIn contrast, the induction of mutL enabled rpoB mutations with \nan average recombination efficiency of 0.2% and 18% without \nand with Cas9 counterselection (Figure 3B). We also re-examined \nthe tetA reversion assays, which introduced a single bp T:T mis-\nmatch that is less efficiently repaired than the A:C mismatch used \nfor rpoB. Induction of the mutator allele increased the recombi-\nnation efficiency by about 100-fold both with and without Cas9 \ncounterselection, achieving a maximum efficiency of 0.3% on aver-\nage (Figure 3C). When generating a single A:G mismatch in the \nackA gene, mutL induction improved recombination by 1000- and \n100-fold with and without Cas9 counterselection, respectively, \nresulting in an average maximum efficiency of 56% ( Figure 3D). \nThese results further highlight the versatility of our system in \ngenerating precise mutations across a diverse range of loci. \nTo further illustrate the efficiency enhancement these tools \noffer over previous methods, we performed the same experiments \nusing the no-SCAR method described previously (12). Single-\nstranded editing oligos targeting the lagging strand were used to \nintroduce the same single bp mismatches as before in cells harbor-\ning pCas9CyMutL and pKDsgRNA, a plasmid encoding the λ-Red \npr\noteins Exo, Beta and Gam under the control of the arabinose-\ninducible PBAD promoter, as well as an sgRNA targeting the wild \ntype gene sequences. When targeting rpoB, induction of mutL\nbefore transformation, during recovery, or both achieved sim-\nilarly high recombination rates as the retron system, yielding \naverage efficiencies >2% with direct selection on rifampicin and \n100% with Cas9 counterselection, a 20-fold increase in recom-\nbinants than without mutL (Supplementary Figure S5A). Regard-\nless \nof whether mutL was induced, Cas9 counterselection effec-\ntively removed unedited cells with 95% of cells plated on aTc \nbeing rifampicin-resistant even without mutL expression. On the \ncontrary, when targeting ackA, mutL induction improved the \nrecombination efficiency less than 10-fold, yielding a maximum \nefficiency of 4.8 × 10–4 when plated on chloroacetate (Supplemen-\ntary Figure S5B ). However, sequencing the ackA gene of several \nputative mutant colonies on the chloroacetate selection media \nrevealed none had acquired the intended mutation. Furthermore, \nCas9 counterselection did not substantially enrich for mutants, \nwith <5% of the colonies on the aTc-induced plate able to grow \nwith chloroacetate when patched (Supplementary Figure S5B), \nindicating most of the colonies on the counterselection plate \nescaped Cas9 killing. These results are consistent with previous \nstudies examining the rate of Cas9 escape in bacteria, which \nreport frequencies ranging from ∼10−3 to 10−4 in multiple species \n(11, 27\n , 33, 34). Overall, the combined mutL and retron-based sys-\ntems result in consistently high mutagenesis rates for single bp \nedits and can outperform traditional oligo recombineering meth-\nods for certain target loci.\nFigure 3. Expression of dominant-negative MutL allele enhances recombination efficiency for single nucleotide point mutations. (A) The MutLE32K gene \nwas cloned into the pCas9CR4 plasmid under the control of the PCymRC promoter for inducible expression. When cumate is added, MutLE32K is \nexpressed and competes with the native MutL for binding to MutS during mismatch repair. The E32K mutation prevents MutH binding, inhibiting \nremoval and repair of the mismatched base. Cells harboring pCas9CyMutL were transformed with (B) pTJV1Sc-rpoB1, (C) pTJV1Sc-tetA or (D) \npTJV1Sc-ackA1 encoding single point mutations for generating the RpoBP564L, TetA*70Y and AckAE54* mutations, respectively, and grown in liquid \nculture with or without cumate. The unmodified pCas9CR4 in both wild-type E. coli and a mutS mutant were used as controls. Recombination \nefficiency with and without Cas9 counterselection was assessed by plating on LB+ rifampicin, LB+ tetracycline or M9+ chloroacetate. Data reported \nare the average of three independent replicates. Error bars represent SEM and statistical significance relative to pCas9CR4 is denoted by asterisks \n(ns = not significant; * = P-value < 0.05; **= P\n-value < 0.01; ***= P-value <0.001; one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test of log-transformed values).\nHindrance of MMR increases the frequency of background \ngenome mutations ( 35, 36); however, the inducibility of our sys-\ntem minimizes the amount of time in which MMR is inhibited. \nSimilarly, uncontrolled expression of the λ-Red genes has also \nbeen shown to increase the rate of spontaneous mutations (37). \nAs \nsuch, constitutive expression of bet in our system could con-\nceivably produce unintended recombination events in the cell. \nTo assess the background rate of mutagenesis in cells with our \nSCRIBE system, we measured spontaneous rifampicin resistance \n(38, 39). Cells were grown overnight, diluted 1:10, grown overnight \nand \nthen spotted on rifampicin to assess the mutation frequency. \nThe wild-type cells spontaneously acquired rifampicin resistance \nat a frequency of 6 × 10–7 on average. Cells constitutively express-\ning bet and cells with the uninduced pCas9CyMutL did not dif-\nfer significantly from the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S6A).\nHowever, induction of the mutator mutL resulted in an average \nmutation frequency of about 1.3 × 10–5, an ∼20-fold increase over \nthe wild-type (Supplementary Figure S6A).\nWhile these results indicate that the unexpressed mutL and \nconstitutive bet did not increase the rate of point mutations, \nwe wanted to assess further whether other genomic mutations \nand rearrangements that would not manifest as rifampicin resis-\ntance were present. Accordingly, we performed whole-genome \nsequencing on the strains grown for two overnights to iden-\ntify polymorphisms within the entire population. A complete \nlist of the mutations identified is in Supplemental File 2. Our \nanalysis revealed 41 total mutations in the population constitu-\ntively expressing bet, constituting a mutation rate of 5.9 × 10 –11\nmutations per cell per generation (Supplementary Figure S6B), \nwith one new IS5 mobile element insertion into the rclA gene.\nFigure 4. Alternative recombinases can enhance efficiency for some targets. (A) The bet CDS on pTJV1Sc was replaced with genes encoding the \nCspRecT and EcRecT recombinases. Recombination efficiency for each of the recombinase variants with and without induction of cas9 expression was \nassessed for (B) the RpoBP564L mutation by plating cells on LB+ rifampicin, (C) the AckAE54* mutation by plating cells on LB+ chloroacetate and (D) the \nTetA*70Y mutation by plating cells on LB+ tetracycline. The pCas9CyMutL plasmid was used for the tetA experiments. Data reported are the average of \nthree independent replicates. Error bars represent SEM and statistical significance is denoted by asterisks (ns= not significant; *** = P-value <0.001; \none-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test of log-transformed values).\nThe uninduced pCas9CyMutL cells displayed a slightly higher \nmutation rate of 2.4 × 10–10; however, both rates were similar to the \nwild-type control, which exhibited a mutation rate of 1.0 × 10 –10. \nIn contrast, 478 mutations were found in the population with \nmutL induced for a mutation rate of 1.59 × 10 –9 mutations per \ncell per generation (Supplementary Figure S6B), as well as a dele-\ntion of the ∼1200 bp insH21 mobile element. Even still, this low \nfrequency of background mutations indicates selecting a mutant \nwith unintended mutations would be a rare occurrence. Over-\nall, these results demonstrate that maintenance of plasmids with \nthe mutL mutator allele or constitutive expression of bet do not \nincrease the frequency of background mutations to a level that \nwould cause concern from a genetic engineering standpoint.\n3.5 Alternative recombinases enhance efficiency \nfor some targets\nRecently, Wannier et al. identified recT from a Collinsella stercoris\nphage (CspRecT) with improved recombination efficiency com-\npared to Beta for oligo mediated recombineering in E. coli (40). \nT\no examine the effect of alternative recombinases in our sys-\ntem, we replaced bet with CspRecT, as well as EcRecT from \nthe E. coli BL21-DE3 chromosome (Figure 4A). We then compared \nthe efficiency of these plasmids across three different targets.\nSurprisingly, our results showed inconsistency for which DNA-\nbinding protein promoted the highest number of recombinants \nbetween the different targets. For the rpoB mutation, EcRecT was \nmore efficient than both Beta and CspRecT, with 92% efficiency \nwhen using Cas9 counterselection (Figure 4B). On the contrary, the \nackA mutation was more efficient with Beta, where 80% of cells \nwere mutants compared to 4.5% for CspRecT and no ackA mutants \nwith EcRecT ( Figure 4C). Given the improvement in efficiency \nseen for tetA when expressing MutL E32K, we used pCas9CyMutL \nin combination with the alternative recombinases. We obtained \nover 100% efficiency for the tetA reversion with CspRecT, both \nwith and without Cas9 counterselection. Although slightly more \ncolonies were observed on the tetracycline plate than on the non-\nselective plate for two of the replicates (Figure 4D), the CspRecT \nclearly outperformed Beta and EcRecT where relatively low levels \nof mutants were found. Thus, in circumstances where a muta-\ntion is difficult to obtain, it is advisable to try these alternative \nrecombinases, while the mechanism causing these discrepancies \nwarrants further investigation.\n4. Discussion\nIn moving the SCRIBE machinery onto the temperature-sensitive \npSC101 origin of replication and combining it with Cas9 coun-\nterselection, we successfully constructed an in vivo system for \nssDNA recombineering that is highly efficient and iterative.\nTargeted counterselection using CRISPR/Cas9 enabled efficiencies \nnear 100% after a single night of outgrowth post-transformation, \nreducing the number of colonies needing to be screened \nfor mutant identification. Moreover, both the ssDNA tem-\nplate and sgRNA sequence can be retargeted for modification \nof any genomic locus with an appropriate PAM in a single \ncloning step using sequence overlap cloning methods. Numer-\nous loci can be mutated without the need for orthogonal \nselection markers or extensive screening procedures, increas-\ning the speed and ease of generating desirable mutants. In \naddition, the pCas9CR4 and pCas9CyMutL plasmids can be \ncured using pKDsgRNA-p15 (Addgene #62656) as previously \ndescribed (12), yielding plasmid-free mutants for downstream\napplications.\nRecombineering is an important tool in the biological sci-\nences, and continued enhancement of recombination efficiency \nacross diverse target loci will decrease strain construction times. \nRecently, Lopez et al. showed that increasing the abundance of \nssDNA produced by retrons significantly improves recombina-\ntion efficiencies (41), consistent with the enhanced efficiencies \nwe observed when increasing the msr–msd/RT expression and bet\nthrough promoter modifications. A complementary strategy is to \nreduce the rate of ssDNA degradation by host nucleases, as the \nHigh-efficiency SCRIBE (HiSCRIBE) system by Farzadfard et al. (20) \ndescribes\n. This system improves upon their original SCRIBE design \nby coupling a strong ribosome-binding site for bet on the SCRIBE \nplasmid with CRISPRi-enabled transcriptional interference of the \nendogenous exonucleases. Recombination efficiencies of nearly \n100% for galK and ∼25% for a kanamycin resistance gene tar-\nget \nwere obtained with these improvements. However, employing \nthe nuclease-deficient dCas9 for CRISPRi prevents the use of the \nnuclease-active Cas9 for counterselection. Although the authors \nshow that CRISPR/Cas9 counterselection can select for recombi-\nnant cells at high efficiencies in an exonuclease knockout strain, \nthis strategy prevents easy system portability since a mutant \nstrain must be used.\nLim et al. (42) also describe a CRISPR/retron-based editing sys-\ntem \nenabling trackable editing and functional screening across \nmultiple loci in a population. However, this system requires the \nsequential transformation and maintenance of three plasmids. \nMoreover, the construction of their retron/sgRNA plasmid requires \nmultiple enzymatic digestions for cloning, contrary to our two-\nplasmid system, which simultaneously retargets the retron and \nsgRNA in a single two-fragment cloning step. Most importantly, \nboth the HiSCRIBE and the CRISPR/retron system of Lim et al.\n(20, 42) would require multiple orthogonal selection markers to \nm\nutate multiple loci within a single cell, as no easy method of \nplasmid curing is included in either design, preventing iterative \nmutagenesis. Although the recombination efficiencies achieved \nwith our system in the absence of counterselection are less \nthan those reported for HiSCRIBE, Cas9-induced cell death of \nunedited cells in the population enabled apparent efficiencies on \npar with HiSCRIBE. The ease with which our system can be retar-\ngeted and used iteratively to incorporate multiple edits combined \nwith its high efficiency in mutant selection provides a quick and \nstraightforward method for constructing mutants relevant to both \nresearch and biotechnological applications. Methods enabling \nmultiplexed editing of numerous genomic loci within populations \nand continuous evolution of targeted loci, using retron-mediated \nrecombineering, have been recently described (20, 42–44) and rely \non efficient editing for generating a library of variants. Our sys-\ntem would be well suited for constructing such libraries, with \nthe added advantage of being curable, thus enabling editing of \ndistant loci within the same cell through repeated rounds of \nlibrary recombineering.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at SYNBIO online.\nData availability\nRaw sequence reads for the off-target mutation frequency exper-\niments are available under the BioProject ID PRJNA813865 in the \nNCBI databases.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Department of Microbiology and \nCell Science, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Univer-\nsity of Florida.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the 2019 University of Florida International \nGenetically Engineered Machine team for inspiring the initial work \non this project and L.

Introduction\nSingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA) has been widely used for vari-\nous bioengineering and synthetic biological studies. For instance, \nssDNA is used in DNA nanotechnology, DNA repair, drug delivery, \nmolecular diagnostics and DNA-based data storage (1). In genome \nengineering, ssDNA is used as a donor repair template (DRT) to \nintroduce the desired mutations in the target DNA via homology-\ndirected repair (HDR) (2, 3). In vitro-synthesized ssDNA is artifi-\ncially delivered into cells through different physical approaches \n(4, 5). However, delivery of exogenous ssDNA in the target host \nremains challenging. Delivery strategies of exogenous ssDNA vary \nby host and are generally do not provide sufficient amounts of \nssDNA for efficient HDR in vivo (4, 5). To accelerate the applica-\ntions of ssDNA, a potential technology for the in vivo production \nof ssDNA is indispensable.\nRetrons are a class of retroelements found in diverse prokary-\notic cells (6, 7). In nature, retrons function as phage defense \nsystems in bacteria ( 8). A wild-type (WT) retron usually com-\nprises two components in a continuous polycistronic genomic \ncassette: a bacterial reverse transcriptase (RT) and retron non-\ncoding RNA (ncRNA). The retron ncRNA generally includes the msr \nand msd. msr is the immediate precursor during multicopy single-\nstranded DNA (msDNA) production, while msd encodes the tem-\nplate sequence for reverse transcription. Upon transcription, the \nmsr and msd RNAs form a unique secondary structure, which can \nbe recognized by the bacterial retron RT, which initiates reverse \ntranscription of the msd sequence using the conserved priming \nguanosine residue in the msr and produces msDNA molecules. \nThe bacterial retron RT and the paired msr are crucial for the con-\nversion of the msd template into msDNA. However, the internal \nmsd sequence can be replaced with a DNA template containing \nany desired mutations (7).\nConsidering the potential of retrons as promising tools in \nmolecular biology, two important improvements, enhancing \nssDNA production by retrons and adapting retrons to work in \nmore host organisms, are essential. Lopez et  al. (9) demonstrated \ndifferent strategies to improve ssDNA production in mammalian \ncells. Remarkably, the extension of the a1/a2 region of the retron \nncRNA facilitated higher ssDNA production in mammalian cells \n(9). Viswanathan et al. (10) downregulated the expression of the \nendogenous exonuclease and showed efficient retron-mediated \ngenome editing in Escherichia coli. Their study showed the impor-\ntance of protecting in vivo ssDNA from the cellular exonuclease. \nWe hypothesized that the ssDNA could be protected by natu-\nral ssDNA-protecting proteins, such as VirE2 from Agrobacterium \ntumefaciens, which is involved in the protection of larger T-DNA \nmolecules during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. VirE2 \ncan bind the T-strand cooperatively, protecting it from degrada-\ntion in plant cells (11, 12). Therefore, we hypothesized that VirE2 \ncould aid retron-generated ssDNA protection and accumulation in \nthe plant cells.\nThe development of efficient genome engineering tools has \ntransformed the biotechnology field (13–17). Clustered regu-\nlarly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-\nassociated protein (Cas) genome editing systems have\nrevolutionized plant biotechnology by allowing for precise genome \nmodifications (14, 18–20), but targeted editing via HDR remains \nchallenging, especially in multicellular eukaryotes, including \nplants ( 2). HDR requires a repair template at the break site to \nedit the DNA sequence (21). Multiple approaches have been used \nto augment HDR efficiency. For example, DNA damage response \nfactors, such as RAD18, stimulate HDR in mammalian cells (21). \nPrime editing uses a chimeric fusion protein of an RNA-guided \nDNA nickase and reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) to extend the \ngenetic information engineered in an RNA template into the target \nsequence (22). Researchers have repurposed retrons as powerful \ntools for genome engineering in several organisms (6, 7, 23). For \nexample, retrons have been coupled with CRISPR-Cas9 tools to \nenrich ssDNA templates at the targeted editing site for HDR in the \nyeast, bacteria, mammalian cells and plants (9, 24–26).\nHere, we set out to build, test and establish an efficient \nretron system to enable enhanced ssDNA production in Nicotiana \nbenthamiana. We harnessed the Ec86 retron system for ssDNA \nproduction. We employed Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-RNA2 vectors \nfor the expression of Ec86 ncRNA and pK2GW7 vector for Ec86 \nretron reverse transcriptase (Ec86 RT). We also tested various \nretron ncRNA architectures and found that Ec86 ncRNA contain-\ning an extension of the a1/a2 region up to 27 bp and a 6-bp \nmsd stem length improved ssDNA production in N. benthamiana. \nFor in vivo ssDNA protection, we co-expressed VirE2, encoding \nan ssDNA binding protein from Agrobacterium, together with the \nretron reagents in N. benthamiana. Additionally, we achieved pre-\ncise genome editing using the CRISPR-Cas9-coupled retron sys-\ntems and showed the potential applications of retron-mediated \nssDNA production in plants.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1 Plasmid design and construction\nFor ssDNA production, we cloned the Ec86 RT driven by the \ncauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter into the \npK2GW7 vector. To test the genome engineering possibilities, we \ncloned the Cas9-fused Ec86 RT under the CaMV35S promoter \ninto the pK2GW7 vector. We built different Cas9 and Ec86 RT \nfusions (Retron-Editors) using a short flexible linker (XTEN) and a \nself-cleaving linker (T2A). To measure protein expression, we cus-\ntomized the Retron-Editors expression sequence downstream of \nthe 3xFLAG sequence. All the above vectors were custom synthe-\nsized by GenScript Biotech.\nFor both the ssDNA production and Retron-Editors-mediated \nHDR studies, we placed the DRT within the msd loop of the retron \nand the Cas9 sgRNA at the 3′ end of both Ec86 ncRNA and modi-\nfied Ec86 ncRNA designs termed Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA, \nrespectively. We selected two regions inside the NbPDS (phy-\ntoene desaturase) gene (PDS-1 and PDS-4) for targeted repair and \ndesigned the corresponding Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA sub-\nstrates. The complete Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA sequences \nwere ordered as gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies. Fur-\nther, we digested the gBlocks with restriction enzymes (PDS-1\nwith XbaI and SacI, and PDS-4 with XbaI and XhoI) and cloned \nthem under the Pea early browning virus (PEBV) promoter at \ncorresponding restriction sites in the TRV-RNA2 vector (27).\nFor VirE2 expression, we isolated A. tumefaciens (strain \nGV3101) total genome and amplified the VirE2 gene sequence \nusing full-length gene-specific primers (VirE2 KpnI forward—\n5′-AAGGTACCATGGATCCGAAGGCCGAAGGC-3′ and VirE2 SpeI \nreverse—5′-TTACTAGTCTACAGACTGTTTACGGTTGGGCCGCG-\n3′), appending the KpnI and SpeI restriction sites at the 5 ′ and 3′\nends. The VirE2 amplicons were then cloned under the CaMV35S \npromoter at KpnI and SpeI sites in the pMDC43 vector.\nW . Jiang et al.  3\n2.2 Plant material and Agrobacterium-mediated \ngenetic transformation\nT wo- to three-week-old WT N. benthamiana plants grown under \nlong-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark at 25 ∘C) were used for \nall leaf infiltration experiments. We transfected the pK2GW7\nvectors containing Cas9-RT protein effectors and the TRV-RNA2\nvectors containing the retron-sgRNA substrates into Agrobac-\nterium GV3101 cells, independently. Agrobacterium cells harbor-\ning Cas9-RT protein effectors and retron-sgRNA substrates were \nco-infiltrated into N. benthamiana. For the ssDNA protection exper-\niments, the Agrobacterium cells harboring the pMDC43 vector car-\nrying a VirE2 gene expression unit were co-infiltrated together with \nthe pK2GW7 and TRV-RNA2 vectors (27).\n2.3 Western blot analysis\nTo check the Cas9-RT fusion protein accumulation, we conducted \nWestern blot analyses. The infiltrated leaves were frozen and \nground thoroughly in liquid nitrogen, and whole protein was \nextracted following a previously described method ( 28). Then, \n30 μl of the protein was separated by an 8% polyacrylamide gel. \nThe protein was transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene \ndifluoride (PVDF) membrane as described by Mahas  et al. (29). \nThe membranes were incubated with primary antibody against \nα-FLAG antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) and then anti-mouse anti-\nbody (1:1000, Invitrogen) to detect FLAG fusion proteins. Finally, \nthe membrane was treated with an ECL detection reagent (Thermo \nScientific) and observed under a chemiluminescent scanner.\n2.4 Southern blot analysis\nIn vivo ssDNA production was detected by Southern blot analysis. \nssDNA can be extracted together with the total RNA ( 30). There-\nfore, we isolated total RNA from all the infiltrated leaves using \nInvitrogen™ TRIzol™ reagent as described in the manufacturer’s \nprotocol. Total extracted RNA (20μg) from each target was used for \nthe Southern blot experiment. We conducted independent South-\nern blot experiments for each target using 60 pg of the 140-bp \namplified msd-DRT-msd fragment as a size range positive con-\ntrol. We used total RNA isolated from plants lacking the Ec86 RT \n(only transfected with RNA2-Retro-sgRNA or pK2-Cas9/RNA2-Retro-\nsgRNA and the WT) as negative controls. To distinguish the ssDNA \nfrom the total RNA, the same RNA samples without any nucle-\nase treatment, with RNase treatment and with DNase treatment \nwere run side by side in the same agarose gel for each target. \nIn the case of plants containing modified retron architectures, \nsuch as RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-\nmRetro-sgRNA-3, we treated all the samples with RNase and ran \nthem on an agarose gel. We then conducted the Southern blot \nexperiment as described by Ali et al. (30).\nFor the corresponding PDS-1 and PDS-4 targets, we used 100-\nbp (only the DRT) DIG-labeled denatured DNA sequences as \nprobes for the RNA2-Retro-sgRNA and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA com-\nbinations in Southern blotting experiments. After the DIG-probe \nhybridization, the membrane was washed and treated with anti-\ndigoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (Roche). The anti-digoxigenin-AP \nFab fragments were then washed out, and the membrane was \ntreated with CDP-star chemiluminescent substrate (Sigma life \nsciences). Finally, the membrane was imaged under the ChemiDoc \nimaging system (Bio-Rad) and evaluated by Image J software.\n2.5 Amplicon deep sequencing\nAmplicon deep sequencing was used to test the Retron-Editors-\nmediated precise genome engineering in N. benthamiana. We iso-\nlated the total genomic DNA from three independent infiltration \nexperiments for each target (three different biological replicates) \nand performed deep amplicon sequencing. Subsequently, the \n∼300-bp Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) fragment was amplified \nusing high-fidelity Phusion polymerase with gene-specific primers \nmentioned in Primers_GeneFrags.fa file. The PCR amplicons were \nfurther purified and used for MiSeq library preparation. The library \nwas prepared using TruSeq Nano DNA Library Prep kit following \nthe manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were run on the \nMiSeq platform, and the data were analyzed using online Cas-\nanalyzer software (31). The HDR frequencies were determined as \nthe ratio of HDR reads among the total reads with both indicators.\n2.6 Statistical analysis\nThe raw data were analyzed and visualized by GraphPad Prism 9. \nAll numerical data were presented as mean± standard deviation. \nWe included three independent biological replicates in amplicon \ndeep sequencing experiments. For each replicate, both HDR and \nindel frequencies of the WT group and six experimental groups \nwere measured. T wo-tailed Student’s t-tests were selected for sta-\ntistical analysis to measure the differences among the indicated \ngroups.\n3. Results\n3.1 Design and construction of retron systems \nfor in planta expression\nTo harness the retrons for ssDNA production in plants, we \ndesigned and cloned EC86-RT downstream of the CaMV35S pro-\nmoter in the pK2GW7 vector to construct the pK2GW7-RT vector \nand tested it in transient expression assays (Figure 1a). We adopted \ndifferent strategies to exploit the retron functions for genome \nengineering applications (Figure 1b). We fused Cas9 and EC86-RT \ntogether using two different linkers, XTEN and T2A, to express the \nEC86-RT and Cas9 as a single or separate protein, respectively. \nCas9 was located at the N-terminus, while EC86-RT was located \non the C-terminus of the linkers. In another modality, we designed \nthe EC86-RT on the N-terminus and Cas9 on the C-terminus using \nXTEN as the linker (Figure 1b). We cloned these cassettes under \nthe control of the CaMV35S promoter on the pK2GW7 backbone. \nThe pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9 constructs were used as controls for our \nexperiments (Figure 1b).\nWe replaced the WT Ec86 ncRNA msd loop sequence with our \n100-bp DRTs comprising the ∼47-bp homology arms and desired \nmutations for PDS-1 or PDS-4 targets (Figure 1b and c). The DRT \nsequences comprise different targeted mutations, including a \n5-nt insertion ( PDS-1) and a 6-nt deletion (PDS-4) (Figure 1c). To \navoid re-targeting, we destroyed the protospacer adjacent motif \nsequences in the DRTs via a 1-nt substitution (Figure 1c). Employ-\ning the above-mentioned DRTs and sgRNA sequences of the \nPDS-1 and PDS-4 targets, we designed a basic Retro-sgRNA archi-\ntecture that contained the 6-bp msd stem and a 12-bp a1/a2 \narm (Figure 1b). We used the TRV-RNA2 vector system to express \nthe Retro-sgRNAs under the PEBV promoter (Figure 1b). The anno-\ntated sequence plasmids are included in PlasmidSeqs.zip file.\n3.2 Retron-mediated ssDNA production in\nN. benthamiana\nTo test whether retrons produce ssDNA in plants, we co-infiltrated \nthe pK2-RT and RNA2-Retro vectors via Agrobacterium into young \nN. benthamiana leaves. We hypothesized that the RNA2-Retro vec-\ntors generate Retro-sgRNA transcripts in vivo, and then EC86-RT \nreverse transcribes the Retro-sgRNA transcripts to produce ssDNA \n4 Synthetic Biology, 2022, Vol. 7, No. 1\nFigure 1.

(a) Retron Ec86-RT and Retron Ec86-ncRNA are expressed independently. \nLater, the Ec86 RT recognizes the hairpin structure in msr and initiate reverse transcription from the priming guanosine to synthesize msDNA.

(c) The N. benthamiana PDS gene sequence and the \nDRT sequences employed for repair by the Retron-Editor system.\nFigure 2. Southern blot analysis for the detection of ssDNA. Total RNA was isolated from N. benthamiana to detect PDS-1 and PDS-4 targets and run \nwithout any nuclease treatment, with RNase treatment, and with DNase treatment on an agarose gel side by side, together with the 140-bp amplified \nPDS-1 or PDS-4 msd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe for the corresponding target. The membrane was \nimaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).\nin vivo. Leaves were sampled 3 days post-infiltration and used for \nmolecular analysis.\nWe confirmed the protein expression from different\nCas9-linker-Ec86 RT fusions in N. benthamiana. We observed \na 200 kDa band corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9-XTEN-Ec86 RT \nand 3XFLAG-RT-XTEN-Cas9 from the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and \npK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 constructs, respectively. We also observed \nan extra 170 kDa band corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9 in \npK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT construct (Supplementary Figure S1). We \nassumed that the orientation of Cas9-XTEN-Ec86 RT fusion is \nunstable. The pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT construct produced a 170 kDa \nband corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9, indicating that the self-\ncleaving T2A linker was completely cleaved. Overall, our results \nconfirmed that Cas9-linker-Ec86 RT was successfully expressed in\nN. benthamiana.\nTo detect and corroborate the production of ssDNA, we per-\nformed Southern blotting analysis and probed for the PDS-1 and \nPDS-4 targets. We extracted the total RNA and used it directly with-\nout any treatment. The same RNA was also treated with RNase to \ndigest all the RNA and/or with DNase to digest all DNA. The RNA \nwithout treatment, RNase-treated and DNase-treated samples \nwere run on the same blot to distinguish between RNA and DNA. \nThe RNA without treatment showed strong signals, indicating the \npresence of various transcripts along with ssDNA (Figure 2). The \nDNase-treated samples also showed strong signals, representing \nthe presence of retron transcripts  (Figure 2). The RNase-treated \nW . Jiang et al.  5\nFigure 3.

(a) Representation of the different retron structural modifications in msr and msd sequence lengths. (b)Total RNA was \nisolated from N. benthamiana to detect PDS-1 and PDS-4 targets and the RNase-treated samples were run on an agarose gel together with the 140-bp \namplified PDS-1 or PDS-4 msd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe for the corresponding target. The \nmembrane was imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).\nsamples showed a single band at 140 bp in all the targets with \npK2-RT, pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-\nRT backbones together with the corresponding RNA2-Retro-sgRNA\nconstruct, suggesting the production of ssDNA (Figure 2). However, \nthe RNA2-Retro-sgRNA alone, RNA2-Retro-sgRNA with pK2-Cas9 and \nWT plants did not produce any ssDNA (Figure 2). The pK2-RT and \npK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones showed much higher ssDNA produc-\ntion compared with the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9\nbackbones (Figure 2). Overall, these results indicate that EC86-\nRT and Retro-sgRNA were expressed in the plant cells to produce \nssDNA. However, pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT, where Cas9 and RT are pro-\nduced as two separate proteins, showed higher ssDNA compared \nto the other designs.\n3.3 Modifications in the retron architecture \nincreased ssDNA production\nTo improve ssDNA production, we modified the retron architec-\nture with different msd and a1/a2 arm lengths (Primers_Gene-\nFrags.fa file). We designed mRetro-sgRNA-1 with a 6 bp msd stem \nand extended the a1/a2 arm up to 27 bp; in mRetro-sgRNA-2, we \nextended the length of the msd stem up to 18 bp and kept the \na1/a2 arm length up to 12 bp. Similarly, in mRetro-sgRNA-3, the \nmsd stem was extended up to 18 bp and the a1/a2 arm up to 27 \nbp (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S2a).\nWe tested the ssDNA production of the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-\n1, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures \ntogether with the pK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT back-\nbones by Southern blot analysis. In order to compare the \nimprovement of the modified retron designs, we also included \nthe unmodified RNA2-Retro-sgRNA version together with the \npK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones in the same \nSouthern blotting experiment. Compared to the unmodified \nRNA2-Retro-sgRNA version, the new RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 ver-\nsion together with the pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones \nshowed improved ssDNA production for both PDS-1 and PDS-4 \ntargets (Figure 3b). However, the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-\nmRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures together with the pK2-RT and pK2-\nCas9-T2A-RT backbones showed very little or no ssDNA production \nof the PDS-1 or PDS-4 targets (Figure 3b). As expected, all retron \narchitectures with the pK2-Cas9 backbone did not show ssDNA \nproduction (Figure 3b). The extension of the a1/a2 region in \nthe RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 version significantly improved ssDNA \nproduction, while the msd stem extension in both RNA2-\nmRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures did not \naid ssDNA production. The RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 version with \na 6 bp msd stem and a 27 bp a1/a2 arm showed higher \nssDNA production compared to the other designs. This further \nshowed that modifications in the retron architecture affect ssDNA\nproduction.\n6 Synthetic Biology, 2022, Vol. 7, No. 1\nFigure 4. Southern blot analysis for the detection of ssDNA in N. benthamiana co-expressing VirE2 and retron systems. Total RNA was isolated from N. \nbenthamiana to detect the PDS-4 target, where RNase treated and the samples were run on an agarose gel together with the 140-bp amplified PDS-4\nmsd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe. The membrane was imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system \n(Bio-Rad).\n3.4 VirE2 facilitated successful ssDNA production\nWe reasoned that in addition to retron architecture, there must \nbe other factors that impact ssDNA production. One of these \nfactors is the stability of the ssDNA after synthesis via reverse \ntranscription. VirE2 is involved in the protection of ssDNA dur-\ning Agrobacterium-mediated transformation ( 11). Therefore, we \ncloned VirE2 gene from Agrobacterium under the CaMV35S pro-\nmoter in the pMDC43 vector and built the pMDC43-VirE2 vector \n(Supplementary Figure S2b). We performed Southern blotting with \nthe N. benthamiana leaves co-infiltrated with the pMDC43-VirE2\nvector together with the Cas9-RT effectors (pK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and \npK2-Cas9-T2A-RT) and the retron substrates (PDS-1: RNA2-mRetro-\nsgRNA-1 and PDS-4: RNA2-Retro-sgRNA, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1\nand RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3). We included RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1\ntogether with pK2-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT without pMDC43-\nVirE2 as the experimental controls. Total RNA, including ssDNA \nfrom all the samples, was RNase-treated, and then Southern blot-\nting was performed. As previously observed, RNA2-Retro-sgRNA\nand all the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA sequences with the pK2-Cas9 back-\nbone did not produce ssDNA. Interestingly, the co-expression \nof pMDC43-VirE2 with retron substrates (PDS-1: RNA2-mRetro-\nsgRNA-1 and PDS-4: RNA2-Retro-sgRNA, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 and \nRNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3) and pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT showed a \nsignificant amount of ssDNA production compared to the samples \nwithout pMDC43-VirE2 (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3 ). \nWe analyzed the difference in ssDNA production between RNA2-\nmRetro-sgRNA-1 co-expressed with VirE2 and without VirE2 by \nImageJ software and found a 10.7-fold and 9-fold enhance-\nment of ssDNA for PDS-1 and PDS-4 with VirE2 co-expression \n(Supplementary Figure S4a and b). These results demonstrated \nthat VirE2 protected the ssDNA from degradation and therefore \nsignificantly enhanced the amount of ssDNA.\n3.5 Retron-Editors-mediated precise HDR in\nN. benthamiana\nBecause retron-mediated ssDNA has been used for HDR in the \nyeast and mammalian cells ( 9, 25), and because we success-\nfully produced ssDNA with our retron designs, we hypothe-\nsized that retron-meditated ssDNA overproduction might facil-\nitate HDR in N. benthamiana cells ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). \nTo test this, we extracted total genomic DNA from the infil-\ntrated leaf samples (three independent biological replicates for \neach target), amplified the target DNA by PCR and used the \nPCR amplicons for deep sequencing. We initially tested the \nability of all the Cas9-RT effectors, including pK2-Cas9, pK2-\nRT, pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT, \nfor HDR. The pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT construct with different RNA2-\nRetro-sgRNAs showed greater HDR frequencies: 0.1% ± 0.04% for \nPDS-1 and 0.03% ± 0.01% for PDS-4 targets (Figure 5a). How-\never, the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-RT con-\nstructs with different RNA2-Retro-sgRNAs did not show sub-\nstantial HDR (Figure 5a). No HDR events were detected when \nonly RNA2-Retro-sgRNA or RNA2-Retro-sgRNA was transfected \nwith pK2-Cas9 (Figure 5a). The results showed that the Cas9-\nRT effectors mediated HDR editing in a RT and Cas9-dependent\nmanner.\nSimultaneously, we examined double-strand break repair via \nnon-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which produces insertions \nand deletions (indels). Among the three fusion backbones, we \nobserved greater indel frequencies with pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT in all \nthe targets, viz., 28.7% ± 2.4% ( PDS-1) and 12.2–18.6% ± 7.5% \n(PDS-4) (Figure 5b). pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9\nshowed minimal indel frequencies (Figure 5b). As expected, pK2-\nCas9 showed greater indel frequencies, whereas no indels were \nobserved in only RNA2-Retro-sgRNA and pK2-RT with RNA2-Retro-\nsgRNA (Figure 5b).\nTo check whether higher ssDNA abundance can improve \nthe HDR efficiency of Retron-Editors, we also conducted deep \namplicon sequencing for the plants carrying the improved RNA2-\nmRetro-sgRNA-1 architecture with pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT and with and \nwithout co-expression of the pMDC43-VirE2 vector. Unfortunately, \nwe did not observe improvement in HDR efficiency with these \nmodifications (Supplementary Table S1) and co-expression of the \npMDC43-VirE2 vector (Supplementary Table S2). Overall, these \nresults showed poor HDR frequencies in plant cells, and further \nW . Jiang et al.  7\nFigure 5.

Discussion\nIn vivo ssDNA production would allow for expanded applications \nin various fields of study, including synthetic biology and nan-\notechnology, and for various bioengineering applications (1). Fur-\nthermore, the localized production of exogenous ssDNA to serve \nas a template for HDR is an important goal for genome editing \nstudies. In genome engineering, the synthetic ssDNA is delivered \ninto the targeted tissues by several physical methods (4, 5). Despite \nefforts, devising an efficient modality for in vivo ssDNA produc-\ntion remains a challenge. Retron systems produce ssDNA in vivo\ncontinuously in several organisms ( 7). Moreover, retrons enable \nssDNA production in germline cells where the HDR machinery is \npredominant, leading to precise genome editing (25). Besides, the \ncapability of retron-mediated ssDNA production has been further \napplied for continuous self-evolution (35), biological data storage \n(36, 37) and high-throughput functional variant screening (38). \nThe exploration of retron functions in planta would adapt these \nretron toolkits for plant biological applications. Considering retron \nEc86 system has been well studied for ssDNA production and HDR \nin bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells ( 9, 25), we selected the \nretron Ec86 system to produce ssDNA in N. benthamiana. ssDNA \nproduction is dependent on the retron ncRNA structure and the \nretron RT ( 9, 32). Instead of using WT Ec86 ncRNA, we replaced \nthe WT msd template with our DRT sequences (100 bp) at the msd \nloop region as suggested by Sharon et al. (25). Our results showed \nsuccessful ssDNA production in N. benthamiana. Moreover, the pro-\nduction of ssDNA was more efficient with the pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT \n8 Synthetic Biology, 2022, Vol. 7, No. 1\nand pK2-RT constructs, which contain free RT protein. Since \nthe abundance of ssDNA is directly related to the availability \nof retron RT, we assumed that the greater production of ssDNA \nwith pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT was due to the availability of the inde-\npendent Ec86 RT protein. The lower abundance of ssDNA in the \nXTEN-fused Retron-Editors, which produce Cas9-XTEN-RT fusion \nproteins, may result from steric hindrances and the functional \ninhibition of the RT protein. Our results also confirmed that ssDNA \nproduction is retron RT dependent, since no ssDNA was detected \nwhen RNA2-Retro-sgRNA with pK2-Cas9 or only RNA2-Retro-sgRNA\nwas transfected into N. benthamiana leaves.\nLopez et al. (9) showed that extension of the length of the a1/a2 \narm could aid in ssDNA production in E. coli, yeast and mammalian \ncells. In line with this, our modified retron architectures, such as \nRNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 harboring a 6-bp msd stem and an a1/a2 \narm (msr) extension up to 27 bp, showed that the a1/a2 exten-\nsion improved ssDNA production. Since the a1/a2 region acts as \na primer for reverse transcription, a longer a1/a2 region may bet-\nter facilitate reverse transcription to improve ssDNA production \n(9). However, our results showed that extension of the msd stem \nlength in RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 caused \nadverse effects on ssDNA production. One potential explanation \nis that the secondary structure of retron ncRNA (reverse tran-\nscription region) becomes more complicated with the extension \nof msd stem region which would affect the reverse transcrip-\ntion for retron ssDNA (Supplementary Figure S6). We also specu-\nlated that the in vivo-produced ssDNA would be severely degraded \nby cellular exonucleases in plant cells and that ssDNA protec-\ntion from cellular exonucleases might increase the abundance of \nssDNA in vivo. VirE2 functions in T-DNA protection during Agrobac-\nterium-mediated transformation (11). Therefore, we co-expressed \nVirE2 with the retron systems and found a 10.7-fold improvement \nof ssDNA production. Overall, we established a high-efficiency \nssDNA production method via co-expression of VirE2 with the \nretron systems in N. benthamiana.\nAdditionally, we tested retron-based genome editing platforms \n(Retron-Editors) in N. benthamiana . Deep amplicon sequencing \nshowed successful HDR repair by Retron-Editors, indicating that \nssDNA can be harnessed as the repair template for HDR in plants. \nThis also demonstrated the accuracy of ssDNA produced in plants. \nFor Retron-Editors, the fusion of Ec86 RT with Cas9 on either \nN-terminal or C-terminal might affect the Cas9 activity. There-\nfore, the self-cleavage linker (T2A linker) should be selected for \nthe linker between Ec86 RT and Cas9 for higher genome editing \nefficiency. After confirming the positive effects of VirE2 and the \nextension of the a1/a2 region on ssDNA production, we also tested \nthese designs for genome editing. However, the new designs did \nnot improve the HDR frequency, indicating that the abundance \nof ssDNA is not the limiting factor. Conversely, Lopez  et al. (9) \nobtained around 60% of HDR edit in yeast cells via Cas9/retron-\nmediated precise genome editing in 48 h. The differentiation in \nthe abundance of retron-produced ssDNA in yeast cells and planta\ncould cause the difference. Compared with two-nucleotide mod-\nification, five-nucleotide modifications in this study are more \ndifficult which might also result in lower HDR frequencies. Fur-\nther efforts are needed to improve the HDR editing efficiency \nof Retron-Editors in plants. For example, VirE2 binding proteins \n(VIP1 and VIP2) have been reported to target the T-strand to \nregions of chromatin, promoting integration. The co-expression \nof VIP proteins and VirE2 may improve the targeting of ssDNA to \nchromatin so as to improve HDR efficiency (33). Suppressing the \nNHEJ pathways has also been reported to stimulate HDR repair sig-\nnificantly. Qi et al. (34) achieved a 5-fold to 16-fold enhancement \nin HDR editing in a ku70-mutant Arabidopsis. In the future, \nthe downregulation of NHEJ key factors would also be tested to \nimprove Cas9/Retron system. Additionally, we tested two loci in \nthe PDS gene which showed clear variations in genome editing effi-\nciencies in this study. Therefore, higher HDR efficiencies might be \nachieved if other target genes were tested in the future. In sum-\nmary, this study proposed a new strategy for in vivo ssDNA produc-\ntion in plants, which will have great potential for various biological\napplications.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at SYNBIO online.\nData availability\nThe sequence reads for amplicon deep sequencing experiments \nare now available under the BioProject ID PRJNA889753 in the \nNCBI databases.\nMaterial availability statement\nMaterials used in this study can be made available upon request.\nFunding\nThis work is supported by KAUST baseline funding to M.M.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank members of the genome engineering and \nsynthetic biology laboratory at KAUST for their critical discussion \nand technical help in this work.\nAuthor contributions\nM.M. conceived the project; W .J., G.S.R., R.A., H.B., R.K., and K.S. \nconducted the experiments; W .J., G.S.R., and M.M. analyzed the \ndata; and W .J., G.S.R., H.B., and M.M. wrote the manuscript.\nConflict of interest statement: None declared.\nAbbreviations\nmsDNA: multicopy single-stranded DNA\nssDNA: single-stranded DNA\nHDR: homology-directed repair\nDRT: donor repair template\nRT: reverse transcriptase\nReferences\n1.

Microbiome          (2022) 10:207  \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-022-01404-x\nRESEARCH\nPopulation structure of an Antarctic aquatic \ncyanobacterium\nPratibha Panwar, Timothy J. Williams, Michelle A. Allen and Ricardo Cavicchioli* \nAbstract \nBackground: Ace Lake is a marine-derived, stratified lake in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica with an upper oxic \nand lower anoxic zone. Cyanobacteria are known to reside throughout the water column. A Synechococcus-like spe-\ncies becomes the most abundant member in the upper sunlit waters during summer while persisting annually even \nin the absence of sunlight and at depth in the anoxic zone. Here, we analysed ~ 300 Gb of Ace Lake metagenome \ndata including 59 Synechococcus-like metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to determine depth-related variation \nin cyanobacterial population structure. Metagenome data were also analysed to investigate viruses associated with \nthis cyanobacterium and the host’s capacity to defend against or evade viruses.\nResults: A single Synechococcus-like species was found to exist in Ace Lake, Candidatus Regnicoccus frigidus sp. nov., \nconsisting of one phylotype more abundant in the oxic zone and a second phylotype prevalent in the oxic-anoxic \ninterface and surrounding depths. An important aspect of genomic variation pertained to nitrogen utilisation, with \nthe capacity to perform cyanide assimilation and asparagine synthesis reflecting the depth distribution of available \nsources of nitrogen. Both specialist (host specific) and generalist (broad host range) viruses were identified with a \npredicted ability to infect Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus. Host-virus interactions were characterised by a depth-dependent \ndistribution of virus type (e.g. highest abundance of specialist viruses in the oxic zone) and host phylotype capacity \nto defend against (e.g. restriction-modification, retron and BREX systems) and evade viruses (cell surface proteins and \ncell wall biosynthesis and modification enzymes).\nConclusion: In Ace Lake, specific environmental factors such as the seasonal availability of sunlight affects microbial \nabundances and the associated processes that the microbial community performs. Here, we find that the population \nstructure for Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus has evolved differently to the other dominant phototroph in the lake, Candida-\ntus Chlorobium antarcticum. The geography (i.e. Antarctica), limnology (e.g. stratification) and abiotic (e.g. sunlight) \nand biotic (e.g. microbial interactions) factors determine the types of niches that develop in the lake. While the lake \ncommunity has become increasingly well studied, metagenome-based studies are revealing that niche adaptation \ncan take many paths; these paths need to be determined in order to make reasonable predictions about the conse-\nquences of future ecosystem perturbations.\nKeywords: Antarctic microbiology, Cyanobacteria, Synechococcus, Regnicoccus, Nit1C, AsnB, Metagenome-\nassembled genomes, Phylotype, Ecotype, Population structure, Niche adaptation, Host-virus interactions, Specialist \nvirus, Generalist virus, Meromictic lake, Microbial food web\n© The Author(s) 2022.

Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \nphotoautotrophs in marine environments and contrib -\nute significantly to global primary production [1 –3].\nCharacterising Synechococcus species has proven \ndifficult because many have very similar morphology \ndespite possessing distinct GC content, and the poly -\nphyly of organisms classified as Synechococcus has been \nwell noted [4 , 5]. Molecular markers successfully used \nto characterise the phylogeny of Synechococcus spe -\ncies include the 16S–23S rRNA internally transcribed \nspacer region and the DNA-directed RNA polymerase \n(rpoC1), nitrate reductase (narB), nitrogen regulator \n(ntcA), phycoerythrin (cpeB) and cytochrome b6 (petB) \ngenes [6 –12]. To date, more than 20 marine Synecho -\ncoccus clades have been identified using these mark -\ners [11– 15]. A recent study using the GTDB (Genome \nTaxonomy Database) approach [16] with additional \nphylogenomic analysis has reassigned 1085 members of \nthe Synechococcus genus (also referred to as the ‘Syn -\nechococcus collective’) to 15 genera within five distinct \norders: (i) Synechococcales (composed of nine genera \nincluding Synechococcus genus and a monophyletic \ngroup of three genera Regnicoccus, Cyanobium and \nVulcanococcus), (ii) Cyanobacteriales (one genus), (iii) \nLeptococcales (two genera), (iv) Thermosynechococ -\ncales (two genera) and (v) Neosynechococcales (one \ngenus) [5 ]. Synechococcus ecotypes in marine environ -\nments have been determined to be influenced by envi -\nronmental factors (e.g. iron concentration and sunlight \navailability), and genetic variation has been linked to \nthe capacity to utilise sunlight (including chlorophyll a \nconcentration), metabolise nitrogen and adapt to spe -\ncific temperatures and salinity [13, 15, 17, 18].\nIn Antarctica, the polar sunlight cycle produces peri -\nods of 24-h sunlight in summer and 24-h darkness in \nwinter. Despite the continuous availability of sunlight in \nsummer, metagenomic analyses have determined that \nthe abundance of Synechococcus is low or undetectable in \nthe Southern Ocean south of the polar front [19–21]. In \ncontrast, in marine-derived Ace Lake (Vestfold Hills, East \nAntarctica), a cyanobacterium related to Synechococcus \n(hereafter referred to as Synechococcus-like) can bloom \nto high levels [22–25]. Ace Lake is stratified (meromic -\ntic) with a mixed upper oxic zone (mixolimnion) and a \nstagnant bottom anoxic zone (monimolimnion) that \nare separated by an oxic-anoxic interface (Fig.  1a) [22, \n25–27]. At the oxic-anoxic interface, below the depth at \nwhich cyanobacteria bloom, another phototroph, Candi-\ndatus Chlorobium antarcticum (green sulphur bacteria), \nthrives, producing considerable biomass (e.g. >  108 cell \n ml−1). The predominance of these two types of phototro -\nphs illustrates the importance that sunlight energy can \nplay in sustaining specific Antarctic, microbially domi -\nnated ecosystems [22–25, 28, 29].\nAs for other Synechococcus species, studying the eco -\nphysiology of Ace Lake Synechococcus-like species \nhas proved challenging, with cultivation and isolation \nattempts not achieving axenic cultures; however, a non-\naxenic culture was obtained and extensively characterised \n[23]. Subsequent cultivation of this non-axenic culture \nand DNA sequencing resulted in a genome sequence for \nSynechococcus sp. CS-601 (SynAce01), enabling adaptive \ntraits to be inferred based on comparative genomics [30].\nPhylogenetic analyses have placed the Ace Lake cyano -\nbacterium in Marine cluster 5.2 with Synechococcus \nsourced from the water column of neighbouring lakes in \nthe Vestfold Hills: Lake Abraxas and Pendant Lake [23, \n30]. Synechococcus-like cyanobacterial species have also \nbeen reported from other Antarctic aquatic and ter -\nrestrial environments, including microbial mats from \nHighway Lake in the Vestfold Hills, Firelight Lake in the \nBølingen Islands [31] and Lake 59b, Lake Reid and Heart \nLake in the Larsemann Hills [32, 33]; lakes in northern \nVictoria Land [34]; the littoral zone of Lundström Lake \nin the Shackleton Range [35]; lithic substrates from McK-\nelvey Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys [36]; and weathered \ngranite from Miers Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys [37].\nExpeditions to retrieve samples from Ace Lake for \nmetaproteogenomics first occurred in the austral sum -\nmer 2006/2007, and subsequently in 2008/2009, with \nsamples covering a complete seasonal cycle obtained in \n2013–2015; biomass was collected by sequential size \nfractionation onto 3.0-, 0.8- and 0.1-μm pore-sized filters, \nwith the metagenome data generated enabling the char -\nacterisation of diverse lake microorganisms [24, 25, 28, \n29, 38, 39]. The abundance of Synechococcus-like opera -\ntional taxonomic units (OTUs) was assessed according \nto filter fraction, lake depth and season (Fig.  1b) [24, 25]. \nSynechococcus-like OTUs were present primarily in the \n3–20 and 0.8–3  μm filter fractions and were detected \nat all lake depths sampled; a fermentative capacity was \ninferred to enable the Ace Lake Synechococcus-like spe -\ncies to persist (in low abundance) in the dark, anoxic \nzone and throughout the water column during periods \nwhen sunlight is absent (e.g. winter) [25]. Highest Syn -\nechococcus-like OTU abundance occurred in the oxic \nzone in summer (≤ 58% of OTUs in a metagenome), with \nlevels reduced in early winter (≤ 6%) and re-established \nin late winter (≤ 16%) and spring (≤ 51%); the seasonal \nabundance dynamics were linked to changes in tempera -\nture and available sunlight [23, 25].\nTo date, genomic variation of Ace Lake Synechococcus-\nlike species has not been investigated. However, varia -\ntion may conceivably occur in response to changes in \ndepth which affects dissolved oxygen (DO) concentra -\ntion, salinity (increases with depth below the oxic-anoxic \ninterface) and sunlight (decreases with depth and does \nPage 3 of 22\nPanwar et al.

To assess this, metagenomic reads were mapped \nto Synechococcus-like metagenome-assembled genomes \n(MAGs) enabling single nucleotide polymorphisms \n(SNPs), indels (insertion/deletion of multiple bases) \nand variable coverage regions (VCRs) to be assessed; an \napproach that has proven successful for studies of other \nAntarctic species including haloarchaea and Ca . Chlo -\nrobium antarcticum [29, 40–43]. Here, we interrogated \nvariation of two Ace Lake Synechococcus-like MAGs \nthat had different 16S rRNA gene sequences (one each \nfrom the oxic zone and anoxic zone) by using Ace Lake \nmetagenomes representing a time and depth series to \n(i) investigate genomic variation in the Synechococcus-\nlike species populations from different seasons (summer \nvs winter vs spring) and lake depths (oxic vs oxic-anoxic \ninterface vs anoxic) to identify potential phylotypes and \necotypes, (ii) analyse defence genes and potential viral \npredators of the Synechococcus-like species to under -\nstand their host-virus interactions and (iii) evaluate the \npotential factors that might have driven the development \nof the Synechococcus-like species ecotypes.\nResults and discussion\nOverview of Ace Lake metagenomes \nand Synechococcus‑like MAGs\nA total of 120 time-series Ace Lake metagenomes from \nsummer (Jan, Feb, Dec), winter (Jul, Aug) and spring \n(Oct, Nov), sampled from seven lake depths (surface, \noxic 1, 2 and 3, interface, and anoxic 1, 2 and 3) and 11 \ntime periods (spanning 2006, 2008 and 2013–2015), were \nused for analyses (Fig.  1a; Additional file  1: Table  S1). \nFor fragment recruitment (FR) analysis, 60 metagen -\nomes (302  Gb), in which Synechococcus-like OTU rela -\ntive abundance was ≥ 1% [25], were used to generate 30 \nmerged metagenomes by pooling reads from 3-20 and \n0.8–3  μm filter metagenomes that represented specific \ndepths and time periods (Additional file  1: Table S1). For \nviral analysis, 39,287 Ace Lake viral contigs (724  Mb) \nfrom the Antarctic virus catalogue [25, 44] were used to \nidentify potential viruses associated with the Synechococ-\ncus-like species.\nA total of 59 high- or medium-quality MAGs gen -\nerated from Ace Lake metagenomes (one MAG per \nmetagenome) were analysed (Additional file  2: Data -\nset S1), of which 25 MAGs were ≥ 99% complete. IMG \n(Integrated Microbial Genomes) taxonomy classified \nall the MAGs as SynAce01. Together, the Synechococ -\ncus-like MAGs consisted of 6681 contigs that encoded \n176,198 genes. For FR analysis, two Synechococcus-like \nMAGs were used: one from the Jul 2014, 5 m depth (oxic \n1), 3–20  μm filter metagenome (MAG-AL1), and one \nfrom the Dec 2014, 14 m depth (anoxic 1), 3–20 μm fil -\nter metagenome (MAG-AL2). MAG-AL1 contained 64 \ncontigs, 2929 genes, was 99.7% complete (2,644,322  bp) \nwith 0.09% contamination and was selected for its high \nbin completeness and lowest bin contamination. MAG-\nAL2 contained 120 contigs, 2956 genes, was 97% com -\nplete (2,654,228  bp) with 0.63% contamination and was \nselected because it contained a distinct 16S rRNA gene \nsequence (Additional file  1: Table  S2; Additional file  2: \nDataset S1).\nSynechococcus‑like species phylotypes in Ace Lake\nA total of 18 full-length (1489 bp) 16S rRNA genes were \nidentified in Synechococcus-like MAGs; they were iden -\ntical except for the MAG-AL2 gene which distinguished \nit as a separate phylotype from MAG-AL1 (and all other \nMAGs) by having two SNPs: 217 A-T and 231 G-T \n(Fig.  2; Additional file  1: Fig. S1a). By recruiting reads \nfrom the merged metagenomes to the two reference \nMAGs (MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2), the two SNPs at \npositions 217 and 231 (i.e. the MAG-AL2 transversions) \nwere determined to be present in all Ace Lake merged \nmetagenomes (Additional file 1: Table S3).\nThe IMG genome of SynAce01 [30] contains two full-\nlength 16S rRNA genes. MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 each \ncontain one full-length 16S rRNA gene, and MAG-AL2 \ncontains an additional incomplete 16S rRNA gene (see \nsupplementary text). The ratio between 16S rRNA SNPs \nmedian read depth (from 100% identity FR) and the \nread depth of its respective MAG was ~ 2 (Additional \nfile 1: Fig. S2), indicating that each MAG contained two \nvery similar 16S rRNA genes, similar to SynAce01. By \ncomparison, the read depth ratio for Ca . Chlorobium \nFig. 2 Synechococcus-like species 16S rRNA SNP markers. Mismatches at positions 217 and 231 highlighted in the full-length genes from MAG-AL1, \nMAG-AL2 and the two SynAce01 genes (arbitraily assigned ‘gene 1’ and ‘gene 2’). See Additional file 1: Fig. S1a for the full-length alignment of the \nfour genes\nPage 5 of 22\nPanwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \n \nantarcticum, which contains one 16S rRNA gene [29], \nwas ~ 1 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).\nThe two 16S rRNAs from SynAce01 are not identical. \nBoth genes had 217  T (as for MAG-AL2), while ‘gene \n1’ had 231 G (as for MAG-AL1) and ‘gene 2’ had a base \nmissing at position 231 (possibly an assembly error) \n(Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). The read depths for the \ntwo SNP markers for gene 1 were different (Additional \nfile 1: Fig. S3f), and only one read in all the metagenome \ndata matched both SNP markers of gene 1. Due to the \ndifficulties of isolating an axenic and non-clonal strain \n(see above and Ref. [23]), it is possible that the SynAce01 \ngenome represents two or more closely related Synecho -\ncoccus-like strains. In support of this, FR analyses of the \noriginal NCBI SRA SynAce01 reads to SynAce01 16S \nrRNA genes revealed read sequences with either 217 A \nplus 231 G (as for MAG-AL1) or 217 T plus 231 T (as for \nMAG-AL2). For all these reasons, the SynAce01 genome \nwas not used for assessments of population variation \n(further discussion is provided in supplementary text).\nThe SNP markers (217 A-T plus 231 G-T) were used to \nevaluate the contributions of the MAG-AL1 and MAG-\nAL2 phylotypes to the total Synechococcus-like species \npopulation (Fig. 3a; Additional file  1: Table S4). The rela-\ntive contribution of the two phylotypes varied with depth \nand season. In all metagenomes, the MAG-AL1 phylo -\ntype contributed the most to the Synechococcus-like spe -\ncies population, with highest representation in the oxic \nzone. The MAG-AL2 phylotype had highest representa -\ntion (almost 50% of the total Synechococcus-like species \npopulation) in the oxic-anoxic interface or anoxic 1 depth \n(Fig. 3a).\nThe relative contributions of MAG-AL1 and MAG-\nAL2 were used to calculate their abundances in Ace Lake \nhighlighting their distribution throughout the water \ncolumn (Fig.  3b). The highest abundance of MAG-AL2 \nin each time period occurred at different depths, with \nit being prevalent at the oxic-anoxic interface and sur -\nrounding depths. This suggested that MAG-AL2 signa -\ntures from the anoxic depths might not be from dead \ncells.\nIn addition to the two SNPs that define MAG-AL1 \nand MAG-AL2, seven additional SNPs were identi -\nfied in three oxic zone metagenomes (Additional file  1: \nTable S3). These seven SNPs might be indicative of other \nSynechococcus-like species phylotypes (distinct from \nMAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2) in the oxic zone, particularly \nin surface waters, where SNP frequencies were higher \n(21–25%) than in oxic 1 (16–19%) and oxic 2 (3–5%) \n(Additional file 1: Table S3).\nPhylogeny and global representation of Ace Lake \nSynechococcus‑like species\nIn addition to the high identity between 16S rRNA genes \nfrom MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 (99.9% identity), the \naverage nucleotide identity (ANI: 99.6% over 92% align -\nment fraction), average amino acid identity (AAI: 99.3% \nover 90% alignment fraction) and digital DNA-DNA \nhybridisation (dDDH: 97%) were high (Additional file  1: \nFigs. S1 and S4), indicating that these two phylotypes \nbelonged to the same species and subspecies.\nPhylogenetic tree construction based on 16S rRNA \ngenes and whole proteome content (Fig.  4), and ANI \nand AAI analyses of closely related MAGs and reference \ngenomes obtained from GTDB (Additional file 3: Dataset \nS2) demonstrated that Ace Lake cyanobacterial genomes \n(SynAce01, MAG-AL1, MAG-AL2) formed a tight clade \nwith ≤ 82% ANI and ≤ 79% AAI to other taxa. The MAG-\nAL1 and MAG-AL2 16S rRNA genes had ≤ 98% iden-\ntity to 16S rRNA genes available in databases from IMG \npublicly assembled metagenomes and public isolates \n(Additional file 3: Dataset S2). The closest non-Antarctic \nspecies (≤ 98% identity) included Synechococcus sp. 1G10 \n(Nahuel Huapia Lake, Argentina), Synechococcus sp. \nMW101C3 (Lake Mondsee, Austria) and Synechococcus \nsp. WH5701 (Long Island Sound, New York; Ref. [45]). \nEach of these species, along with SynAce01 from Ace \nLake, has recently been placed in the novel genus Reg -\nnicoccus [5]. The 16S rRNA genes of Synechococcus from \nLake Abraxas and Pendant Lake (Vestfold Hills; Ref. [30]) \nwere ≤ 98% identical to the MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 \nsequences. Based upon these data, the Ace Lake cyano -\nbacterium appears to represent a distinct species that is \npossibly confined to this water body. This contrasts with \nthe green sulphur bacterium, Ca.  Chlorobium antarcti -\ncum, which has an identical 16S rRNA gene sequence \nfrom Ace Lake, Taynaya Bay and Ellis Fjord [29]. In \nview of the phylogenetic characteristics of the Ace Lake \ncyanobacterium, we name a new Ace Lake species: Can -\ndidatus Regnicoccus frigidus sp. nov. (from fri’gi.dus. \nL. masc. adj. frigidum cold, referring to the cold envi -\nronment) (type MAG MAG-AL1: GenBank accession \nID = JAOANE000000000; IMG bin ID = 3300023237_10; \n99.7% complete; 0.09% contamination) (Additional file  2: \nDataset S1).\nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus population variation\nSNPs (variant frequency ≥ 0.9), indels (read depth ≥ 20) \nand VCRs (significance of gene coverage variation \nassessed using DESeq2) were identified from FR of reads \nthat represented different lake depths and time periods to \nMAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 (Fig. 5; Additional file 4: Data-\nset S3). Variation was lower in MAG-AL1 (75 SNPs and \nPage 6 of 22Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \n17 indels from 45 genes) than MAG-AL2 (572 SNPs and \n27 indels from 157 genes) (Additional file 4: Dataset S3).\nSNPs and indels were identified in genes involved in \ncell wall or membrane biosynthesis and modification, \ntransport, translation, carbohydrate metabolism, amino \nacid biosynthesis and other metabolic processes, as well \nas some hypothetical genes (Additional file  4: Dataset \nS3). Only a few SNPs and indels from each MAG were \nconsistently represented across metagenomes from \ndifferent time periods of the same depth (Additional \nfile  4: Dataset S3; further discussed in supplementary \ntext). This indicated that most Ca.  Regnicoccus frigi -\ndus mutations were not stable, with the temporal vari -\nation observed being indicative of a relatively dynamic \npopulation. The mutations in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 \ngenes were observed mainly in the anoxic and oxic depth \nmetagenomes, respectively (Additional file  4: Data -\nset S3).

MAG-AL2 genes with stable muta -\ntions encoded the following: carboxysome shell carbonic \nanhydrase (carbon dioxide fixation); a vitamin K epoxide \nreductase family protein (post-translational modifica -\ntion); glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (glycerolipid \nsynthesis); N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate dea -\ncetylase (cell wall synthesis and glycolysis); a glycosyl -\ntransferase (cell wall modification); UDP-glucuronate \ndecarboxylase (cell wall modification); and four hypo -\nthetical proteins (Additional file 4 : Dataset S3).\nMost variable coverage genes (VCGs) with significant \ncoverage variation were of unknown function, i.e. hypo -\nthetical or uncharacterized proteins, poorly character -\nized or coded for mobile elements (Additional file  4: \nDataset S3). The remainder were genes involved in the \nfollowing: cell wall or membrane biosynthesis and modi -\nfication, transport, stress response, cell defence, cyanide \nassimilation and other metabolic functions (Additional \nfile  4: Dataset S3). Significant gene variations were \nonly identified for comparisons by depth, specifically \noxic vs anoxic and oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface (Fig.  6; \nAdditional file  4: Dataset S3). Most VCGs with similar \nfunction had distinct sequences in MAG-AL1 and MAG-\nAL2, with the depth-dependent variation specific to each \nMAG: the VCGs had higher coverage in the oxic zone \nfor MAG-AL1 and higher coverage in the oxic-anoxic \ninterface and anoxic zone for MAG-AL2 (Figs.  5 and 6; \nAdditional file  4: Dataset S3). This pattern of coverage \nmatched phylotype abundance, with MAG-AL1 more \nprevalent in the oxic zone and MAG-AL2 more so in the \noxic-anoxic interface and surrounding depths (Fig.  3b; \nFig. 4 Ace Lake cyanobacterium phylogeny.

The annuli are first \nsegregated by lake depth (surface, 0 m; oxic 1, 5 m; oxic 2, 12–13 m; interface: 13–15 m; anoxic 1, 14–16 m; anoxic 2, 18–19 m; anoxic 3, 23–24 m) \nand then arranged by season (summer: Jan, Dec; winter: Jul, Aug; spring: Oct, Nov). Metagenome reads with ambiguous mapping were allowed to \nmap to the first best site, resulting in coverages of genes with multiple copies exceeding 100%; for display purposes, coverage was capped at 120%. \nOuter to inner annuli: MAG-AL1 contigs 1–64 or MAG-AL2 contigs 1–120; 0 m: 27 Jan 2015; 5 m: Dec 2014, Jul 2014, Aug 2014, Nov 2008 and Oct \n2014; 12–13 m: Dec 2014, Jul 2014, Aug 2014, Nov 2008, Nov 2013 and Oct 2014; 13–15 m: Dec 2014, Jul 2014, Aug 2014, Nov 2008, Nov 2013 and \nOct 2014; 14–16 m: Dec 2014, Nov 2008, Nov 2013 and Oct 2014; 18–19 m: Dec 2014, Nov 2008, Nov 2013 and Oct 2014; 23–24 m: Dec 2014, Nov \n2008, Nov 2013 and Oct 2014\nPage 8 of 22Panwar et al.

These data would be consist -\nent with niche adaptation, with MAG-AL1 and MAG-\nAL2 possessing genetic capacities tailored to growth and \nsurvival in the oxic and anoxic zones, respectively (also \nsee below in ‘Niche adaptation in Ace Lake’).\nAlignments of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs \nrevealed that contigs that did not align or had poor align-\nment tended to contain VCGs or putative viral genes \n(Additional file 5: Dataset S4). However, MAG-AL2 con -\ntigs 118–120 did not match any other MAGs. These con -\ntigs had low read depth in all metagenomes, and their \ngene relative coverages showed depth-dependent vari -\nation: oxic-anoxic interface and anoxic zone, < 24%, and \noxic zone, ≤ 0.2% (Additional file  4: Dataset S3). Some \nof the genes on these contigs (e.g. glycine hydroxym -\nethyltransferase, ATP adenylyltransferase, bifunctional \ndemethylmenaquinone methyltransferase/2-methoxy-\n6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol methylase UbiE, murein \nDD-endopeptidase MepM/murein hydrolase activator \nNlpD, MFS family permeases, selenophosphate syn -\nthetase) were present with normal coverage elsewhere in \nMAG-AL2, suggesting that all Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus \npopulations studied possessed these functional traits.\nThe remaining low coverage genes represented Ca.  \nRegnicoccus frigidus populations at the oxic-anoxic \ninterface and in the anoxic zone that possessed a genetic \ncapacity not present in the Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus \npopulations in the oxic zone. Two genes annotated as \na carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) matura -\ntion factor and a predicted RNA-binding protein con -\ntained CooC and CooT domains, respectively; these are \ndomains found in accessory proteins involved in the \nmaturation of anaerobic CODH that occurs by the inser -\ntion of nickel into the active site [46, 47]. No CODH \ngenes were identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs, \nsuggesting that the CooC and CooT domain-containing \nenzymes may function in anaerobic process(es) involving \nnickel-dependent pathways.\nGC content of contigs was plotted against read depth \nto assess the presence of contig clusters representative \nof divergent (< 95% sequence similarity) Ca.

Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs. Volcano plots showing variations in \nMAG-AL1 (a, c, e, g, i, k) and MAG-AL2 (b, d, f, h, j, l) gene coverages in samples from different lake depths (oxic, interface, anoxic) or seasons \n(summer, winter, spring). Each dot in a plot represents a MAG gene. The y-axes indicate the statistical significance (− log10 of P-value) of the change \nin gene coverage, with significance increasing from bottom to top: red dots, genes with fold change > 1 or <  − 1 and P ≤ 0.05; blue dots, genes \nwith fold change between − 1 and 1 and P ≤ 0.05; black dots, genes with P > 0.05. The y-axis scale varies for each plot to enhance data visibility. See \nAdditional file 4: Dataset S3 for a list of genes with significant fold changes. The x-axes indicate the magnitude of change (log2 of fold change) in \ngene coverage: positive fold change, gene coverage higher in samples taken as numerator; negative fold change, gene coverage higher in samples \ntaken as denominator. For example, in the oxic vs anoxic plots (a) and (b), the oxic zone samples were considered as numerator, while the anoxic \nzone samples were taken as denominator. Therefore, the MAG-AL1 genes represented by red dots in a have significantly higher relative coverage in \noxic zone samples, whereas the MAG-AL2 genes depicted by red dots in b have significantly higher relative coverage in anoxic zone samples. g–l \nNo significant gene coverage variations were observed during comparison of seasonal samples (see further description in supplementary text)\nPage 10 of 22Panwar et al.

Regnicoccus frigidus \nMAGs (Additional file  1: Table  S5; also see supplemen -\ntary text ). The analyses indicate that Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus phylotypes with a high level of divergence (< 95% \nsequence similarity) were not abundant and, given the \nlarge size of the Ace Lake dataset, are not typical of the \nlake ecosystem.\nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses\nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus viral contigs were identified in \nseveral ways (Additional file 6: Dataset S5): A) 31 in IMG/\nVR v3 from Ace Lake metagenomes: vOTU_081954 (22), \nvOTU_248451 (7), Sg_292136 (1) and Sg_613705 (1). B) \n22 viral contigs aligned to the 59 Ca.  Regnicoccus frigi -\ndus MAGs: vOTU_022592 (16) and Sg_256402 (1) from \nIMG/VR v3 and cl_2442 (2), cl_463 (1), sg_14817 (1) \nand sg_14822 (1) from the Antarctic virus catalogue. C) \n11 previously identified viral contigs based on matches \nto a cyanophage assembled from Ace Lake metagenome \ndata: cl_6580 (2), cl_6727 (2), cl_9495 (1), cl_9892 (1), \nsg_14929 (1), sg_14949 (1), sg_14969 (1), sg_14971 (1) \nand sg_15003 (1) from the Antarctic virus catalogue [25]\nThe set of 22 and the set of 11 viral contigs contained \ngenes that were taxonomically classified to a variety of \nmicroorganisms, indicating the viral contigs might rep -\nresent generalist viruses that prey on multiple hosts. \nFive of the 22 viral contigs were present in two Ca.  Reg-\nnicoccus frigidus MAGs, two verrucomicrobial MAGs \nand one actinobacterial MAG (Additional file  6: Dataset \nS5), indicating that these viral contigs likely represented \nprophages in the respective MAGs. The set of 31 viral \ncontigs included three predicted prophages in IMG/VR \nv3 (Additional file 6: Dataset S5). Two of these prophages \nplus 10 other viral contigs aligned to some Ca.  Regnico-\nccus frigidus MAGs (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). The \nprediction of prophages is consistent with two prophage \nregions (phiSynAce1 and phiSynAce2) reported for the \nSynAce01 genome [30].\nOverall, the data for these three sets of viral con -\ntigs suggests that (i) vOTU_081954, vOTU_248451, \nSg_292136 and Sg_613705 represent Ca. Regnicoccus \nfrigidus specialist viruses, some of which are prophages; \n(ii) Sg_717548 and Sg_723842 (and nine viral contigs \nfrom the Antarctic virus catalogue) represent generalist \nviruses that prey on cyanobacteria; and (iii) Sg_256402 \nand vOTU_022592 (and five viral contigs from the Ant -\narctic virus catalogue) likely represent generalist viruses \nthat prey on an even broader range of hosts (Additional \nfile 6: Dataset S5).\nMAG-AL2 contained more predicted prophages than \nMAG-AL1, although the total viral gene composition \nfor each MAG was similar (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). \nGene coverage of the predicted MAG prophages was high \n(MAG-AL1 ≤ 7000 read depth; MAG-AL2 ≤ 8000) com-\npared to MAG read depths (both MAGs < 700) (Addi -\ntional file  6: Dataset S5). The set of 31 Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus viral contigs had high coverage (< 6500), some of \nwhich belonged to Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs. The \nhigh coverage contigs are likely to represent viral prog -\neny of integrated (i.e. MAG prophage) or nonintegrated \nviruses associated with cells.\nSearches for additional prophages in MAG-AL1 and \nMAG-AL2 were performed based on read coverage (i.e. \nhigh), gene composition and/or proximity to already \npredicted prophages. All prophages identified by this \nprocess were ≤ 19  kb in length, which is short by com -\nparison to known cyanophages and therefore likely rep -\nresent remnants of previous prophages (Additional file  6: \nDataset S5). The MAG-AL2 prophage genes on contigs \n17, 106 and 111–116 had very low relative coverages in \nsurface and oxic 1 (except Nov 2008) metagenomes com-\npared to metagenomes from deeper depths (Additional \nfile  6: Dataset S5), possibly reflecting a greater loss of \nthese prophage genes from the Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus \npopulation in the upper waters of the lake.\nHost defence against viruses\nRestriction-modification (RM) systems can be encoded \nby hosts and/or viruses and can impact host-virus inter -\nactions in a variety of ways [41, 48–50]. The prophages \nwithin MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 contained a type 2 RM \nDNA methylase, with MAG-AL2 prophages also contain-\ning two type 1 RM DNA methylases (Additional file  6: \nDataset S5). Type 2 RM methyltransferases have been \nassociated with lysogenic lifestyles [49], which would be \nconsistent with the prophage remnants arising from an \nintegrated temperate virus. All subunit genes of a type 1 \nRM system, and additional genes associated with RM sys-\ntems (e.g. type 3 Res subunit domain), were also present \noutside of the prophages in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 \nand were therefore host-specific RM genes (Additional \nfile 7: Dataset S6).\nCRISPR-Cas system genes were not identified in Ca.  \nRegnicoccus frigidus MAGs, consistent with previous \nfindings for Ace Lake Synechococcus-like OTUs [25] \nand other marine cyanobacteria [51]. However, systems \npotentially involved in host-virus interactions included \nthe DISARM (defence island system associated with \nrestriction-modification) and retron systems. DISARM \ngenes identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs \nwere drmMII (DNA [cytosine-5]-methyltransferase) and \ndrmD (SNF2 family DNA/RNA helicase), although genes \nconstituting a complete system were not identified (Addi-\ntional file 7: Dataset S6).\nPage 11 of 22\nPanwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \n \nRetrons are often found near defence systems such as \nRM genes and afford viral defence via an ABI (abortive \ninfection) mechanism and have previously been iden -\ntified in cyanobacteria [52]. Bacterial retrons consist \nof a reverse transcriptase gene, a noncoding RNA and \nan effector gene which encodes a DNA-binding, HNH \nendonuclease, ribosyltransferase or two transmembrane \n(2TM) domains [52]. A reverse transcriptase gene con -\ntaining a bacterial retron domain was identified close \nto a type 1 RM system in MAG-AL1 (Additional file  1: \nFig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). Most genes near \nthe retron homologue were hypothetical genes and did \nnot match known retron effector domains (Additional \nfile 1: Fig. S6), although exostosin family protein domain \n(TM domain) and HicB antitoxin (which contains HTH \ndomain; Refs. [53, 54]) genes were identified adjacent to \nretron homologs in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs and \ncould possibly function as effector genes to constitute a \nfunctional retron anti-phage system.\nDepth-dependent variation was observed for some of \nthe above Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus defence genes (Addi -\ntional file 7: Dataset S6). The MAG-AL1 retron homolog, \ndrmMII, type 1 RM system (two S, one R and one M \nsubunit) and three putative RM (two Uma2 family endo -\nnucleases and one HNH family endonuclease) genes had \nhigher coverage in the oxic zone than in the oxic-anoxic \ninterface or anoxic zone (Fig.  7; Additional file  4: Data -\nset S3; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). A similar pattern of \nvariation occurred for MAG-AL2 drmMII, type 1 RM S \nsubunit and putative RM (HNH family endonuclease) \ngenes. Viruses are prevalent throughout Ace Lake, but \nabundance is highest in the oxic zone [25]. These afore -\nmentioned systems that are overrepresented in the oxic \nzone may reflect a functionality particularly suited to \nresponding to the specific viral population. In contrast, \ntwo type 1 RM R subunit genes and a putative RM gene \n(Uma2 family endonuclease) that were specific to MAG-\nAL2 had 2 to 3 times higher coverage in the oxic-anoxic \ninterface and anoxic zone than the oxic zone (Additional \nfile 4: Dataset S3; Additional file 7: Dataset S6). As MAG-\nAL2 is prevalent in the anoxic zone, the higher coverage \nfor these defence systems suggests they are more specific \nto viruses enriched in the anoxic zone (Fig.  3; Additional \nfile 7: Dataset S6).\nBacteriophage exclusion (BREX) type 1 system genes \n(brxC, brxB, brxA and truncated pglX and brxL) and \nadditional BREX genes (brxHI, brxHII, pglW) were iden -\ntified in both MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2, and pglZ and \ncomplete brxL (often together) were present in some \nother Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs (Additional file  1: \nFig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6). The pglX gene was \ntruncated in MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2, and some Ca.  \nRegnicoccus frigidus MAGs contained two truncated \npglX genes that together constituted the full-length gene \n(Additional file  1: Fig. S6; Additional file  7: Dataset S6; \nfurther discussed in supplementary text). A complete \npglX cyanobacterial gene was also identified in Ace Lake \ncontigs. Similar observations were made for Antarctic \nhaloarchaea resident in Deep Lake (Vestfold Hills) [41]. \nInterruption of the pglX gene occurs in a diverse range \nof microorganisms with acquisition of the gene-by-gene \ntransfer enabling the BREX system to be functional [56]. \nIn addition to the variation in the integrity of the pglX \ngene, only a subset of Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs \ncontained complete sequences of brxL and pglZ (core \nBREX gene) (Additional file 7: Dataset S6). Using a MAG \nthat contained brxL and pglZ (99.7% bin completeness, \n3.6% bin contamination, Dec 2014, 12  m depth, 0.8-μm \nfilter metagenome), both genes were found to have low \nrelative coverages (≤ 25%) in all metagenomes, with cov -\nerage significantly higher in the oxic-anoxic interface \nand anoxic zones than in the oxic zone (Additional file  4: \nDataset S3). These data show depth-dependent variation \nfor BREX genes, with less than a quarter of the Ca.  Reg-\nnicoccus frigidus population possessing brxL and pglZ; \nthat subpopulation would also need to possess (vertical \ninheritance) or acquire (gene transfer) a functional pglX \ngene in order to perform BREX-mediated viral resistance \n(Fig.  7). It therefore appears that the Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus population is limited in its ability to mount, at \nbest, a transient BREX response.\nHost evasion of viruses\nVariation (VCRs, SNPs, indels) was a feature of a vari -\nety of genes encoding cell surface proteins (e.g. TolC \nand porins) or genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis \n(e.g. lipopolysaccharides) and modification (e.g. glyco -\nsyltransferases) (Additional file  4: Dataset S3). Viruses \nattach to cell surface components, including lipopolysac -\ncharides, TolC and porins [57]. The coverages of these \nVCGs involved in cell surface structures in MAG-AL1 \nwere significantly higher in the oxic zone than in the \noxic-anoxic interface or anoxic zone, while the opposite \ntrend occurred for MAG-AL2 (with the exception of a \nfew glycosyltransferases). Moreover, the specific VCGs \nin MAG-AL1 differed to those in MAG-AL2, suggest -\ning that the cell wall composition of the Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus represented by the two MAGs was likely to differ \n(Additional file 4: Dataset S3).\nSNPs and indels identified in some of the Ca.  Reg -\nnicoccus frigidus glycosyltransferases (Additional \nfile  4: Dataset S3) may impact cell wall composition \nby influencing substrate specificity of the enzymes \nand the type of sugar they incorporate during gly -\ncosylation [58, 59]. Variation in glycosyltransferases \nPage 12 of 22Panwar et al.

Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \n \ndata (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table S4). Significant cor -\nrelations occurred between changes in MAG-AL1 \nabundance and depth (Spearman’s rank correlation coef -\nficient ρ =  − 0.6, P = 0.003), DO (ρ = 0.5, P = 0.008) and \nsalinity (ρ =  − 0.6, P = 0.003), but not lake temperature \n(ρ =  − 0.4, P = 0.1). In contrast, no significant correla -\ntions occurred with MAG-AL2 abundance. Of these lake \nfactors, salinity has previously been associated with the \nevolution of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus ecotypes \nin the South China Sea [17].\nSignificant depth-dependent variation in MAG-AL1 \nand MAG-AL2 gene coverages was observed for oxic vs \nanoxic and oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface metagenomes \n(Fig.  6; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). The functional \nproperties of the VCGs encoding metabolic functions \nwere examined to assess what ecophysiological impact \nthey may confer.\nCyanide assimilation\nA Nit1C gene cluster (nitHBCDEFG; contig 33) was \nidentified as a VCR in MAG-AL1, but not in MAG-\nAL2 (Fig.  8a; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). This locus, \nwhich has previously been reported in cyanobacteria, \nbelongs to branch 1 nitrilases that can function during \nnitrogen starvation to assimilate nitriles by hydrolys -\ning them to ammonia (plus a carboxylic acid) [62–67]. \nNit1C gene expression can be highly induced by cyanide \nand repressed by ammonium and is essential for growth \nwhen cyanide is the sole source of nitrogen [64, 65, 67].\nThe Nit1C cluster had significantly higher coverage \n(P ≤ 0.0002) in the oxic zone (81%), compared to the oxic-\nanoxic interface (41%) or anoxic zone (36%) (Fig.  8b and \nc; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). The littoral mats in Ace \nLake contain diverse cyanobacteria as well as predatory \nciliates and rotifers [22, 26], and the ability to produce \ncyanide is widespread among phylogenetically diverse \ncyanobacteria, possibly as a defence mechanism against \ngrazers (e.g. ciliates, rotifers) [68]. It is therefore possi -\nble that the Ace Lake cyanobacteria in the littoral mats \ngenerate relatively high levels of free cyanide (HCN and \n CN−) in the oxic zone, with cyanate generated by abiotic \ncyanide oxidation. The lower Nit1C cluster coverage in \nthe anoxic zone is consistent with this zone having rela -\ntively high levels of ammonium (which represses gene \nexpression) [22, 64, 69, 70]. Cyanate transporter genes \nwere not identified in MAG-AL1, but nitrate and nitrite \ntransporters which were encoded could possibly function \nin the uptake of cyanate and cyanide [71, 72]. These data \nwould be consistent with MAG-AL1 Nit1C genes being \ninduced during nitrogen starvation and/or in the pres -\nence of cyanide, allowing Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus to \nassimilate free cyanide and nitriles as nitrogen sources. \nAs bioavailable nitrogen is limiting in the oxic zone [22, \n70], the Nit1C gene cluster would be expected to enhance \nthe competitiveness of the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus pop -\nulation that possess it.\nAsparagine synthesis\nThe conversion of aspartate to asparagine can be cata -\nlysed by AsnB (glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine syn -\nthetase) using glutamine as the preferred substrate \nor ammonium [73]. An asnB  gene (IMG gene ID: \nGa0222690_10005105) was identified in 18 Ca. Regnicoc-\ncus frigidus MAGs (but not in MAG-AL1 or MAG-AL2). \nWhile the ammonium-dependent asparagine synthetase \ngene (asnA ) was not identified in Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus MAGs, the capacity to use nitrate, nitrite and \nammonia for glutamine production via the GS-GOGAT \n(glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase) cycle was evi -\ndent in Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus (Fig. 7).\nUsing one MAG that contained asnB  (99.7% bin com -\npleteness, 3.6% bin contamination, Dec 2014, 12 m depth, \n0.8-μm filter metagenome), significant coverage variation \nwas found between the anoxic zone (specifically anoxic 2 \nand 3; average 22%) and the oxic-anoxic interface (6%) or \nthe oxic zone (5%) (Fig.  9; Additional file  4: Dataset S3). \nIn ammonium-rich environments, AsnB can catalyse the \nformation of asparagine [74], and may therefore enable \nthe anoxic zone Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus population \n(where ammonium levels are high; Refs. [22, 69, 70]) to \nbenefit by being able to assimilate ammonia using AsnB \n(Fig.  7). Conversely, in the nitrogen-limited oxic zone, \nby having a capacity to perform glutamine-dependent \nasparagine synthesis [75], the relatively small asnB  popu-\nlation would be expected to have an improved capacity \nto utilise bioavailable nitrogen (Fig.  7). While less than \nhalf of the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population possessed \nasnB, the gene was consistently identified in metagen -\nomes representing all lake strata (oxic, oxic-anoxic inter -\nface, anoxic) and time (2008 to 2014), indicating it was a \nstable feature of the population (Fig. 9).\nConclusion\nA Synechococcus-like species is the most abundant \nmicroorganism in the oxic zone of Ace Lake, where it \nblooms in response to available sunlight; it also persists \nin the oxic zone during long periods when sunlight is \nabsent, as well as throughout the dark, anoxic depths of \nthe lake [23–25]. Here, we have shown that a single Syn-\nechococcus-like species, composed of two major phylo -\ntypes (one more abundant than the other), colonises Ace \nLake, and that the population composition varies with \nlake depth (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Tables S3, S4, S6). \nThe new species Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus differs (≤ 98% \n16S rRNA identity) to all other characterized Synechoc -\noccus and Synechococcus-like species, including others \nPage 14 of 22Panwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \nfrom lakes in the neighbouring region. Members of the \nSynechococcus collective inhabit diverse aquatic and ter -\nrestrial habitats in Antarctica yet are rare members of the \nsurrounding marine environment. Clearly, temperature \nalone is not an overriding factor that controls the ability \nof Synechococcus to colonise; in fact, the extent and diver-\nsity of Antarctic habitat that supports growth of Synecho-\ncoccus testifies to the cyanobacteria having a capacity to \nadapt ‘happily’ to the Antarctic realm. In Ace Lake, the \nvery abundant, phototrophic ‘neighbour’ of Ca.  Regnico-\nccus frigidus, Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum has evolved \na remarkably coherent population structure that is con -\nserved across lake and stratified marine-basin ecosystems \n[29]. In contrast, based on 16S rRNA divergence, mem -\nbers of the Synechococcus collective are characterized \nby more variability between aquatic systems, and based \non analyses of MAGs, they are characterized as having a \nhigher extent of phylotype diversification (at least within \nAce Lake). The capacity to rigorously interrogate popu -\nlation structure is predicated on having metagenome \ndatasets that are of sufficient quality and size to gener -\nate MAGs and perform comparative analyses of specific \nFig. 8 Depth profile of Ca.

Chlorobium antarcticum and Ca. Regnico-\nccus frigidus reveal is the existence of distinct genomic/\nadaptive characteristics, exemplifying the ways in which \nmicrobial lineages can and do evolve to otherwise ‘com -\nmon’ (Antarctic) environmental conditions.\nNotable characteristics of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus pop-\nulation included depth-related genomic variation: abun -\ndance of the main phylotypes MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 \nand extent and nature of VCRs, SNPs and indels of each of \nthese phylotypes (Figs. 3 and 5; Additional file 1: Table S4; \nAdditional file 4: Dataset S3). Some types of genomic vari-\nability were characterized as being relatively dynamic (e.g. \ntemporal change in SNPs and indels) and others relatively \nstable (e.g. VCRs). The specific genomic variation of the \nphylotypes (gene differences and representation in the \npopulation) described functional variation, in particular, \nmolecular traits ascribing interactions of Ca. Regnicoccus \nfrigidus with its complement of viruses and metabolic dis-\ntinctions denoting ecotypes (Fig. 7).\nViruses have been speculated to drive evolution of \nmarine cyanobacteria leading to the development of \nvirus-susceptible and virus-resistant host populations \nand enabling co-existence of hosts and viruses [60, 76, \n77]. Viruses play particularly important roles in Antarc -\ntic aquatic systems, in part due to the low abundance of \nlarger trophic predators [27]. Similar to the interactions \nof viruses with marine cyanobacteria, complex host-virus \ninteractions have been described for a number of Antarc-\ntic microbially dominated systems [41, 78–86], includ -\ning for Ace Lake [24, 25, 29]. The current study provides \nspecific data about the cell surface structures and defence \nsystems that are likely to be important in evading or neu -\ntralising viruses in order for Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus to \ngrow successfully and persist throughout the water col -\numn of Ace Lake (Fig.  7; Additional file  4: Dataset S3; \nAdditional file 7: Dataset S6).\nThe existence of Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus ecotypes \nwith differing capacities for nitrogen utilisation (cya -\nnide assimilation and glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine \nsynthesis) could be rationalised within the context of \navailable nitrogen in the lake. In Ace Lake, the overall \natmospheric nitrogen level decreases with lake depth, \nbeing absent in anoxic waters below 18  m depth [69]. \nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus cannot fix atmospheric nitro -\ngen. However, it can or is predicted to utilise a variety \nof nitrogen sources including nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, \nFig. 9 Depth profile of abundance of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus asnB gene.

Bio -\navailable nitrogen is limiting in the oxic zone, but the \nanoxic zone is replete in ammonia and amino acids \n[22, 69, 70]. The Nit1C gene cluster in the abundant \nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype in the oxic zone \n(MAG-AL1; Fig.  3b) is inferred to confer an ability to \nutilise free cyanide and nitriles as additional nitrogen \nsources, thereby improving its competitiveness in the \noxic zone (Figs.  7 and 8 ). Utilising a different strategy, \nthe Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus ecotype population con -\ntaining asnB was more prevalent in the anoxic zone \n(Fig.  9), which is inferred to augment the ability of the \npopulation to assimilate ammonia as a source of avail -\nable nitrogen (Fig.  7). AsnB has been experimentally \ncharacterized as preferring glutamine as substrate over \nammonia but in ammonia-rich environments to utilise \nexogenous ammonia as well [74]. Genomic reconstruc -\ntion greatly advances knowledge of genomic potential \nand provides a focus for specific genomic characteristics \n‘of interest’ . Here, we nominate asnB as a gene worthy of \nexperimental evaluation. While not a trivial undertak -\ning, as Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus has proven to be ame -\nnable to laboratory cultivation (SynAce01; Ref. [23]), the \nopportunity exists to attempt to experimentally charac -\nterise the enzyme and the cellular growth properties of \nthe microorganism.\nMethods\nSample collection, DNA sequencing and MAG generation\nSampling, DNA extraction, sequencing, assembly and \nannotation of 120 time-series Ace Lake metagenomes \nfrom 2006/2007, 2008/2009 and 2013–2015 have been \ndescribed previously [25, 28, 38] (Additional file  1: \nTable  S1). Metagenome samples were obtained in sum -\nmer (Jan, Dec, Feb), winter (Jul, Aug) and spring (Oct, \nNov) from seven lake depths: surface, 0  m; oxic 1, 5  m; \noxic 2, 12–13 m; interface, 13–15 m; anoxic 1, 14–16 m; \nanoxic 2, 18–19 m; and anoxic 3, 23–24 m (Fig.  1a; Addi-\ntional file  1: Table S1). The specific oxic-anoxic interface \ndepths (13–15 m) and the anoxic depths (14–16 m) vary \ndepending on seasonal and temporal changes in the lake \nwater level arising from the net balance between inputs \nand outputs [22, 87, 88]. Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs \nwere generated from the metagenomes (only one MAG \nper metagenome) by the IMG pipeline. For MIMAG \n(minimum information about MAGs; Ref. [89]) data, the \nMAG contig statistics N50, L50 and maximum contig \nlength were calculated using BBMap v38.51 [90]; all other \nMAG quality and metadata were taken from IMG (Addi -\ntional file 2: Dataset S1).\nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus genomic variation\nReads from 60 metagenomes in which Synechococcus-\nlike OTUs were identified were used for FR analyses \n(Additional file  1: Tables S1 and S4). Ace Lake 2006 \nmetagenomes were not included due to differences in \nthe sequencing technology and possible dataset size bias \ncompared to the Ace Lake 2008 and 2013–2015 metage -\nnomes [29]. Metagenome reads from 0.8–3 and 3–20 μm \nfilter fractions from each time period and depth were \npooled to create 30 merged metagenomes using a previ -\nously described method [29]. As the relative abundance \nof Synechococcus-like OTU was ≤ 0.3% in all 0.1–0.8-μm \nfilter fraction metagenomes [25], they were excluded \nfrom FR analyses. Anoxic zone metagenomes from win -\nter were not available due to sampling logistical con -\nstraints [25].\nFor the analysis of genomic variation in the Ca.  Reg -\nnicoccus frigidus population, one MAG from the oxic \nzone and one MAG from the anoxic zone were selected: \nMAG-AL1 (IMG Bin ID: 3300023237_10), oxic zone, \nJul 2014, 5  m depth, 3–20-μm filter fraction, 99.7% bin \ncompleteness and lowest bin contamination (0.09%); \nMAG-AL2 (IMG Bin ID: 3300023253_6), anoxic zone, \nDec 2014, 14  m depth, 3–20-μm filter, 16S rRNA gene \nsequence different to MAG-AL1, high genome complete-\nness (97%), and low bin contamination (0.63%). Contig \nand scaffold arrangements of the two Ca. Regnicoccus \nfrigidus MAGs that would best represent draft genomes \nwere determined using previously described methods \n[29]. Nucleotide sequences from MAG-AL1, MAG-AL2 \nand SynAce01 were used for manual rearrangement of \ncontigs (Additional file 1: Table S2).\nFR of metagenome reads to the two MAGs and cal -\nculation of base coverages were performed as described \npreviously [29]. SNPs were detected from FR output \nBAM files using Samtools v1.10 variant calling com -\nmands bcftools mpileup and bcftools call [91, 92], with \nthe –max-depth option adjusted to highest read depth \nobserved in each metagenome. Variant call output files \nwere further scanned using an in-house python script \nto identify SNPs with ≥ 90% frequency (i.e. at least 90% \nof the aligned reads contained the SNP) and insertion/\ndeletion of multiple bases (indels). Only SNPs and indels \nwith read depth ≥ 20 were considered. Additionally, FR of \nreads to a Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG from Dec 2014, \n12 m depth and 0.8-μm filter metagenome (IMG bin ID: \n3300023227_3) was performed to assess the coverage \nvariation of glutamine-hydrolysing asparagine synthetase \n(asnB), alkaline phosphatase (pglZ) and ATP-depend -\nent Lon protease (brxL) genes in Ace Lake merged \nmetagenomes.\nDifferences in gene orders of MAGs were assessed by \naligning the Ca.

Align-\nments were manually parsed to identify MAG contigs \nwith no matches, low identity matches (< 80%), low align-\nment fraction matches (<  50% contig length aligned) or \nshort length matches (< 1 kb alignment length).\nGC content vs read depth analysis\nGC content-read depth analysis was performed as \ndescribed previously for Haloarchaea [ 39] and Ca. Chlo-\nrobium antarcticum [29]. Metagenome contigs of ≥ 10 kb \nlength and 30–80% GC content, and Ca. Regnicoccus \nfrigidus MAG contigs, were plotted using Python v3.6.4. \nThe taxonomies of the metagenome contig clusters that \nwere close to the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG con -\ntig cluster (i.e. metagenome contigs with 45–80% GC \ncontent) were determined from the IMG phylodist file-\nbased contig taxonomies described previously [ 25]. \nThese metagenome contigs were also aligned to Ca. \nRegnicoccus frigidus MAGs and the SynAce01 genome \nusing blastn module of BLAST  + v2.9.0. Alignment files \nand taxonomies were manually parsed, and contigs with \nlow identity (<  95%) and high alignment fraction (>  50%) \nmatches were further assessed to identify other cyano -\nbacteria in Ace Lake that might be distantly related to \nCa.

Regnicoccus frigidus MAG \nin a merged metagenome, calculated as median of read \ndepth values of each base in a MAG, was used to repre -\nsent Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population abundance in \nthe metagenome. The abundance of a Ca. Regnicoccus \nfrigidus gene in a merged metagenome was calculated as \ngene coverage using the formula as follows:\nwhere the numerator indicates the sum of the read \ndepths of the bases in the gene, in each merged metagen -\nome, and the denominator indicates the total number of \nbases in the gene.\nTo assess the proportion of Ca.

The numera -\ntor is the coverage of a gene from a MAG, and the denomi-\nnator indicates the median read depth of the MAG in a \nmerged metagenome. For estimation of relative coverages \nof asnB, pglZ and brxL (complete sequence) genes, the \nmedian read depth was used for the MAG from which the \ngenes were taken (see above in ‘ Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus \ngenomic variation’). Average of relative coverages of gene(s) \nfrom a depth zone (oxic, oxic-anoxic interface, anoxic) \nwas calculated by taking the mean of relative coverages of \ngene(s) in merged metagenomes from all depths and time \nperiods in the zone.\nANI, AAI, 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analyses\nThe pairwise ANI of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs \nwere performed using previously described methods [29]. \nAAI between MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 was estimated \nusing AAI calculator online service [94, 95]. Furthermore, \ndDDH values and confidence intervals were calculated at \nthe Type (Strain) Genome Server [ 96, 97] using the rec -\nommended settings of the Genome-to-Genome Distance \nCalculator 3.0 [ 98, 99]. SNPs were identified in the 16S \nrRNA genes of MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 using the FR \ndata in the Integrative Genomics Viewer [ 100]. Of these, \ntwo SNPs at positions 217 and 231 were observed in both \nMAGs and in SynAce01 16S rRNAs in all merged metage-\nnomes and were used as SNP markers. The frequencies \nof these SNPs, with read depths  ≥ 20, were used to calcu -\nlate the percentage contributions of the two MAGs to the \noverall Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus population in a merged \nmetagenome (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table  S4). Of the \nSNP frequencies at positions 217 and 231 in a MAG 16S \nrRNA gene in a merged metagenome, the smaller value \nwas selected to reflect the percentage contribution of \nthe Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype. For example, \nin oxic 2, Nov 2008 metagenome, the SNP frequencies \nat positions 217 (T) and 231 (T) of MAG-AL1 (normal \nbases: 217 A plus 231 G) were 7 and 4%, respectively \n(Additional file  1: Table  S3). Here, the minimum value \n(4%) was selected to capture the percentage of reads that \nlikely contained SNPs at both positions, and so the rela -\ntive contribution of MAG-AL2 (normal bases: 217 T plus \n231  T) was estimated as 4% in this metagenome (Addi -\ntional file  1: Table  S4). Furthermore, the read depths of \nthe two MAGs were calculated in each metagenome by \nmultiplying their percentage contribution and median \nread depth in a merged metagenome. Stringent FR of \nreads (with 100% identity) to 16S rRNAs from MAG-AL1, \nMAG-AL2 and SynAce01 was performed to evaluate if \nMAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 represented distinct phylo -\ntypes. The 16S rRNA copy number of the two MAGs was \nevaluated by calculating their read-depth ratios, i.e. 16S \nPage 18 of 22Panwar et al.

The MAG \nread-depth ratios were compared to Ca . Chlorobium \nantarcticum 16S rRNA read-depth ratios as references, \nwith ratios > 1 suggesting the presence of multiple cop -\nies. Global representation of Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus was \nassessed by blastn of 16S rRNA genes from MAG-AL1 \nand MAG-AL2 against 16S rRNA gene databases from \nIMG public-assembled metagenomes and public isolates \n(both databases accessed on 22 March 2022), using previ-\nously described methods [29]. The taxonomic novelty of \nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus was assessed through 16S rRNA \ngene and whole proteome phylogeny, along with ANI \nand AAI analyses. Closely related MAGs and genomes \nwere selected based on the placement of the MAGs in the \nGTDB reference tree using GTDB-tk v2.1.0 with database \nR207_v2 [16, 101]. These closely related genomes, along \nwith proposed cyanobacterial type strains [5 ], were uti -\nlised for AAI analysis using CompareM v0.1.2 [102] and \nANI analysis using fastANI v1.32 [103]. Pairwise com -\nparisons of the whole genome, whole proteome and 16S \nrRNA gene sequences were calculated using the Genome \nBLAST Distance Phylogeny approach and distance \nformula d5 [98], as implemented at the Type (Strain) \nGenome Server. The resulting distances were used with \nFastME 2.1.6.1 [104] to infer balanced minimum evolu -\ntion trees, and 100 pseudo-bootstrap replicates were per -\nformed. Based on the observed taxonomic placement, a \nnovel species name was proposed according to the Seq -\nCode regulations [105]. Genomes of the two Ca . Reg -\nnicoccus frigidus phylotypes were submitted to GenBank \n(accession IDs: MAG-AL1, JAOANE000000000; MAG-\nAL2, JAOANF000000000), and the type MAG MAG-AL1 \nwas registered with SeqCode.\nStatistical analyses\nThe significance of the differences in gene coverages from \ndifferent depths (oxic vs oxic-anoxic interface vs anoxic) \nand seasons (summer vs winter vs spring) was assessed \nfor MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 using the DESeq2 R pack -\nage [106] on all MAG genes. For season comparison, the \nsamples from various time periods were grouped as sum -\nmer: Dec and Jan; winter: Jul and Aug; and spring: Oct \nand Nov. For depth comparison, the samples from differ -\nent lake depths were grouped as oxic: surface, oxic 1 and \n2; oxic-anoxic interface: interface; anoxic: anoxic 1, 2 and \n3. The parameters used for assessing significance from \nDESeq2 output were the same as described previously \n[29]. Genes with significant variations were considered as \nvariable coverage genes, and their function was verified \nusing previously described methods [29]. Read depths \nof MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 were used to assess the \nrelationship between the Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus phylo-\ntype abundances and the physicochemical characteristics \nof Ace Lake such as depth, salinity, DO and temperature \n[25] (Additional file  1: Table  S4). The DO values meas -\nured using a YSI Sonde in 2008 and a TOA WQC in 2013 \nand 2014 were normalised, as described previously [25]. \nLake temperature and DO values were not available for \ncertain time periods (Jul 2014 and Jan 2015); therefore, \nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus phylotype abundance data were \ntaken only from merged metagenomes for which all envi-\nronmental data were available. Spearman’s rank correla -\ntion coefficients (ρ) were manually calculated between \nlake characteristics (depth, salinity, DO or tempera -\nture) and Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus MAG (MAG-AL1 or \nMAG-AL2) read depths. For this, the MAG read depths \nand lake characteristics were first ranked individually, \nand then a Pearson product moment correlation coeffi -\ncient was calculated from the rank values. Statistical sig -\nnificance of the correlation was calculated using ANOVA \n(analysis of variance) regression analysis.\nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses\nA list of viral contigs potentially associated with Ca.  \nRegnicoccus frigidus was prepared by the following: (i) \nsearching the IMG/VR v3 database (accessed on 28 June \n2021) [107] to identify Ace Lake viral contigs with Syn -\nechococcus as their predicted host, (ii) including viral \ncontigs in the Antarctic virus catalogue [44] that matched \na cyanophage assembled from an Ace Lake metagenome \n(Additional file 4: Table S4 from Ref. [25]) and (iii) align -\ning the Antarctic virus catalogue contigs to the contigs \nfrom all Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus MAGs (Additional \nfile 2: Dataset S1) to identify viral clusters or singletons \nwith sequence similarity to Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus \nhost genomes (Additional file  6: Dataset S5). Antarc -\ntic virus catalogue contigs from Ace Lake are hosted on \nIMG in the public scaffold set ‘ Antarctic_Virus_cata -\nlogue_2020_Ace_lake’ . Alignment was performed using \nthe blastn module of BLAST + v2.11.0, and only viral \ncontigs with > 95% identity matches were considered for \nfurther analysis. The cluster or singleton assignments of \nthe Ca. Regnicoccus frigidus viruses were gathered from \nIMG/VR v3 database and the Antarctic virus catalogue. \nAdditionally, putative prophage regions in MAG-AL1 \nand MAG-AL2 were identified by aligning MAG con -\ntigs to potential Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus viral contigs \n(determined from the three approaches described above) \nand two SynAce01 prophage sequences (phiSynAce1 \nand phiSynAce2; Ref. [30]) using the blastn module of \nBLAST + v2.11.0. Only contig regions with > 95% identity \nmatches to multiple viral sequences were considered as \nputative prophage sequences in the two Ca.  Regnicoccus \nfrigidus MAGs.\nPage 19 of 22\nPanwar et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:207 \n \nCa. Regnicoccus frigidus defence genes\nIMG gene annotations of MAG-AL1 and MAG-AL2 \nwere manually parsed to identify auto-annotated defence \ngenes associated with RM system, DISARM, BREX sys -\ntem and ABI mechanism (including a retron homo -\nlogue). The functions of these defence genes were verified \nthrough manual annotation, as described previously [29]. \nThe presence/absence of additional BREX system genes \n(brxD, brxE, brxF, brxHI, brxHII, brxL, brxP, pglW, pglX, \npglXI, pglY, pglZ), DISARM genes (drmA , drmB, drmC, \ndrmD, drmE) and ABI mechanism genes (toxI, toxN, \nabiEi, abiEii, rnlA, rnlB) in Ca.  Regnicoccus frigidus \nMAGs were determined through matches of MAG pro -\nteins to reference proteins taken from previous publica -\ntions (BREX genes from Ref. [56]) or NCBI. The Blastp \nmodule of DIAMOND v0.9.31 [108] was used for align -\nment, and only alignments with e-value <  10−5, protein \nidentity > 30% and MAG protein coverage > 50% were \nconsidered.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s40168- 022- 01404-x.\nAdditional file 1: Supplemental data and findings about Ca. \nRegnicoccus frigidus.

Several studies indicated that the\nbacterial immune arsenal towards phage is quite diverse and uses different components of the host\nmachinery. Most studied antiphage systems are associated with phages, whose genomic matter is\ndouble-stranded-DNA. These defense mechanisms are mainly related to either the host or phage-\nderived proteins and other associated structures and biomolecules. Some of these strategies include\nDNA restriction-modification (R-M), spontaneous mutations, blocking of phage receptors, production\nof competitive inhibitors and extracellular matrix which prevent the entry of phage DNA into the\nhost cytoplasm, assembly interference, abortive infection, toxin–antitoxin systems, bacterial retrons,\nand secondary metabolite-based replication interference. On the contrary, phages develop anti-phage\nresistance defense mechanisms in consortium with each of these bacterial phage resistance strategies\nwith small fitness cost. These mechanisms allow phages to undergo their replication safely inside\ntheir bacterial host’s cytoplasm and be able to produce viable, competent, and immunologically\nendured progeny virions for the next generation. In this review, we highlight the major bacterial\ndefense systems developed against their predators and some of the phage counterstrategies and\nsuggest potential research directions.\nKeywords: bacteriophage; phage resistance; phage counterstrategies; prophage; phage therapy\n1. Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance is a major global public health concern and approximately\n10 million people will die yearly worldwide by 2050 because of antimicrobial resistance [1].\nConsequently, novel therapeutic strategies have been sought and must be developed and\nused as an alternative to antibiotics or in conjunction with conventional therapy. One\nof these approaches involves the use of bacteriophages (phages). Phages are the most\nabundant predators of bacteria in nature. According to viral ecologists, phage infections\nhappen about 10 23 times per second worldwide, indicating a very dynamic and large\npopulation [2]. A significant portion of the genes (over 80%) encoded by phages have\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12020381 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381 2 of 17\nneither been linked to known proteins nor have their functions been identified. This makes\nthem the greatest source of genetic novelty in the biological world [3].\nBacterial infections that are difficult to treat can be either treated with phages alone\nor in conjunction with antibiotics [ 4]. Currently, phage therapy is being reevaluated as\na potential alternative to classical therapeutic agents in the Western countries. However,\nthere are still multiple challenges to overcome. These challenges include phage resistance\nrisks, immunity to phages, problems associated with appropriate phage selection, and new\nregulatory requirements [5].\nBacteria and phages are seemingly involved in a continuous battle. It is part of con-\ntinuous cycles of coexistence and evolution, resulting in phage-resistant hosts protecting\nbacterial lineages, while counter-resistant phages threaten such strains. Phages, by devel-\noping resistance, play a crucial role in controlling bacterial populations in most, if not in all,\nthe milieus. Bacteria can evade the phage attack via several mechanisms and some of these\nstrategies include the following: DNA restriction-modification (R-M), spontaneous muta-\ntions, blocking of phage receptors, production of competitive inhibitors, and extracellular\nmatrix and acquired immunity via the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats and associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) mechanism [6–8]. On the contrary, phages\ndeveloped several counterstrategies and circumvent the phage resistance warfare. These\nhost-phage interaction is a complex and multifaceted process, which influences the diver-\nsity of genetic makeup of both bacteria and their predators, and it is one of the driving\nforces creating genetically fit populations from both sides [9].\nIn this review, we present an overview of the major anti-phage defense strategies of\nbacteria and the counterstrategies used by phages to evade these systems and suggest\npotential research directions.\n2. Mechanisms of Phage Resistances\nThe mechanism of phage resistance could take place at various stages of phage replicative\ncycle. During the phage replication cycle, a phage introduces its DNA via translocation into\nthe host’s cytoplasm. This will lead to either the lysogenic cycle (prophage formation) or the\nlytic cycle. In the lytic cycle, phages pass via several steps and early and late gene expression,\nwhich leads to maturation and aggregation of newly produced virion, which are ultimately\nreleased via lysis. The phage resistance strategies can interfere with one of these steps as\nshows in Figure 1 [8], and each resistance mechanism is described in detail below.\n2.1. Preventing Phage Adsorption\nPhage adsorption to the bacterial cell surface is performed through specific receptors as\nthe first step of phage infection cycle. Several bacterial cell surface proteins, lipopolysaccha-\nrides, and other surface polysaccharide and carbohydrate moieties can serve as receptors\nfor phages [ 10]. Bacteria have generated several barriers to prevent phage attachment\nto their cell surface, such as hidden receptors with extracellular matrix [ 11]. Bacterial\nextracellular matrix (a loose network of polymers), such as slime layers (e.g., Campylobacter\nfetus slime layer) or capsules (e.g., Escherichia coli K1 capsule, and Klebsiella pneumoniae\ncapsule) can cover the bacterial surface and makes the phage receptors inaccessible for\nphage binding so that protecting bacteria from phage attack [12]. Some bacterial strains\ncan synthesize competitive inhibitors and mutate (modify) their receptor or by generat-\ning receptors, which are new for the virus [ 13] (Figure 2). The phage receptor diversity\non the surface of the host cell are affected by phage co-evolutionary adaptations to stun\nthese barriers [10]. This includes phase variation and diversity-generating retro elements\n(DGRs) [10]. Phase variation is a reversible, as well as heritable process, regulating the\nexpression of bacterial gene, thereby genes can shift between a non-functional state and\na functional existence ensuing to phenotypic variations among the bacterial community\neven among strains which have similar genotype.

However, phage resistance has been acquired by loss of\nMeOPN receptor on the surface of the organism because of cj1421 gene phase variation,\nwhich encodesd the MeOPN-GalfNAc transferase [14].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 18 \n \n \nFigure 1.

These systems prevent the entry of phage DNA into the cytoplasm of bacterial cell, \nthereby affecting successive infection by other T-even-like phages (Figure 3). The Sp  and \nImm systems act independently, and their mechanism of action is different from one to \nthe other. Imm protects the direct injection of phage DNA into the cytoplasm of bacterial \ncells by altering the structural integrity of the translocation site.

In contrast, the Sp protein, encoded by gp5, downregulate the activity of the \nT4 lysozyme.

Fragmented translocated DNA is recognized \nas non-self (lacking chi sequences) and is subjected for further degradation by RecBCD enzyme. \nThere are four R–M systems, so far identi fied, based on their subunit composition \nand mechanism of action [22]. Type I and III R-M systems cut and methylate translocated \nDNA far from the recognition sites. Type II is the most common R–M system, which cut \nDNA within or near the recognition site. Unlike the other R–M system, type IV systems \ncontain a restriction endonuclease and may or may not have a methylase activity and usu-\nally cut the modified DNA [23]. The antiphage potential of a R–M system is directly re-\nlated to the number of recognition sites found in a phage genome [24,25]. \nThe genome of some virulent phages may be  modified by harboring a rare base hy-\ndroxymethylcytosine (HMC) in place of the ba se cytosine.

CRISPR-Cas Systems \nCRISPR-Cas is one of the advanced bacter ial phage resistance strategies, which has \nbeen detected in nearly 50% and 90% of sequenced bacteria and archaea, respectively [28–\n30]. CRISPR systems are acquired immune syst ems, where long term protection is guar-\nanteed for the second round of infection. In this system, immunological memory is repre-\nsented by short (30–40 base pairs) “spacers”. Spacers, the hereditary foundations for im-\nmunological memory, are generated from phage DNA, and they are flanked by similarly \nshort semi-palindromic repeats. Basically, the cas, which we call CRISPR-associated genes, \ncommonly neighboring the CRISPR locus, encode essential proteins needed for gaining \nnew spacers upon infection and for the target-specific removal of the invader. During re-\nmoval of the invader nucleic acid, RNA-guided Cas nucleases use the crRNAs to identify \nand cut them via complementary base pairing. The CRISPR systems has been categorized \ninto two classes, six types, and several subtypes, mainly based on the composition of cas \ngenes [31], with a wide range of action. \n  \nFigure 5.

Abortive Infection\nAbortive infection (Abi) is a strategy of bacterial cells halt the release of newly pro-\nduced progeny virions at the expense of the life of infected cell, thereby preventing the\nuninfected cell from being infected. It is considered a self-sacrificing event, or apoptosis\nthat averts the subsequent infection of the neighboring bacterial community [ 32]. Each\nAbi system should contain at least two functional modules: one of these should sense the\ninfection of phage and the other one related to cell death accompanied by the shutdown of\nmetabolism following phage sensing. The Abi system senses intermediate replication of\nphage genome [33], early, and/or late structural phage proteins [34,35], or phage proteins\nthat are expressed in the cytosol of the cell during replication [36,37]. The Abi system can\nalso sense extensive phage DNA transcription [38,39] or phage-mediated shutoff of host\ngene expression [40]. Many Abi systems, such as PrrC and Lit, induce cell death because of\nthe inactivation of the host translation system. The Abi gene, abiZ, which protects L. lactis\nagainst phage phi31infection, also induces cell death via cellular membrane damage of\ninfected cells [37]. Premature cell lysis leads to the lysis of the infected cells and results in\nthe release of defective unassembled virions with no potential of infecting other healthy\ncells [37]. Another Abi system based on E. coli data is PifA, which causes abortive infec-\ntion of phage T7 midway through its replication cycle [ 34]. An Abi gene was reported\nto provide protection for Staphylococcus species against Siphoviridae phages through the\nphosphorylation of cellular proteins [36]. In general, research findings indicated that most\nof the Abi system have been identified in Lactococcus lactis and E. coli, whereby nearly\n23 Abi system have been characterized in L. lactis [41] (Figure 6).\nIn recent times, kinase-associated Abi system was identified in Staphylococcus epider-\nmidis, protecting them against Siphoviridae phages [36]. In this system, following infection,\nthe eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase Stk2 was found to phosphorylate several targets\nof the host machinery, including replication, transcription, translation, and related cellular\npathway. This extensive phosphorylation likely interrupts the whole metabolic system to\nresult in abortive infection. Phages counter-attack this system by mutating the pack gene,\nwhich affects the activation of Stk2 and its auto phosphorylation [36].\n2.7. Toxin-Antitoxin Systems\nPhages may trigger the bacterial cells to produce toxins, which my attack the phage\ninfection cycle. There are six major bacterial toxin–antitoxin (TA) types, classified based\non the toxin neutralization mechanisms, the biomolecular and functional characteristics of\nthe TA and, the TA count (some bacteria containing lots of TA gene pairs, such as E. coli\nK-12, which has more than 35 TA pairs) [42]. This wide genetic diversity indicated that\nthe TA system is responsible for many functions: apart from phage resistance, they have\nbeen involved in plasmid maintenance, stress responses, and persisting cell production.\nThe replication pathway of phages can be directly affected by some of the TA system. For\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381 8 of 17\nexample, the MazF/MazE TA system of E. coli can inhibit the infection process of T4 phage\nby inducing MazF’s ribonuclease activity, which ultimately leads to complete cessation\nof the infection cycle [43]. Table 1 summarizes some of the different anti-phage defense\nmechanisms across various species of bacteria.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 18 \n \n2.6.

Bacterial Retrons\nRetrons are bacterial genomic materials composed of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and\nreverse transcriptase (RT). The ncRNA served as a template for RT, producing a chimeric\nDNA/RNA molecule in which the DNA and RNA are covalently connected [56]. Retrons\nhave been named in accordance with a convention, encompassing the first genus letters\nfollowed by species names, as well as their reverse-transcribed DNA lengths (for example,\nE. coli retron, Ec48, has 48 nt long reverse-transcribed DNAs [57]). It has been three decades\nsince retrons were discovered, but little is known about their function. However, the anti-\nphage activity of retrons has been currently reported. Millman and coworkers reported the\nrole of retrons as an anti-phage defense strategy. This defense system is consisted of three\nprincipal units: the ncRNA, RT, and an effector protein. According to the result obtained\nfrom this study, the phage proteins inhibit E. coli RecBCD, causing the retron (Ec48) to\nactivate and kill the cell via Abi [58]. The authors suggested that retrons serve as second\ndefense line if the first defense line has collapsed (Figure 7).\n2.9. Bacterial Secondary Metabolites (Chemical Agents)\nAntiphage defense systems discussed so far have largely been mediated by RNA or\nproteins complexes acting on individual cells. However, bacterial secondary metabolites,\nsuch as gibberellins, toxins, alkaloids, and biopolymers, can interfere with the replication\ncycle of phages via different mechanisms and defending them from phage attack [ 59].\nMaxwell and coworkers introduced a chemical anti-phage defense mechanism that pre-\ndominantly occurred in soil fungus, Streptomyces spp. They reported that Streptomyces\nspp. synthesized two vital bioactive metabolites (doxorubicin and daunorubicin) that bind\n(intercalate) into the DNA of phage and prevent the replication cycle. Interestingly, the\nbacterial growth pattern was not affected by these molecules. It has been proposed that\ndaunorubicin exerted its action at an early stage in the phage replication cycle, after the\ntranslocation of the DNA, but ahead of replication. Doxorubicin forms free radicals (e.g.,\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381 10 of 17\nOH•), which can damage DNA and cause DNA oxidation (Figure 8). The authors also\nreported that these metabolites can disperse into bacteria cells and safeguard them from\ninfection [60]. Idarubicin and pirubicin are other DNA intercalating agents, which are\nproduced by Streptomyces spp. These metabolites are thought to affect the circularization\nprocess of the phage linear DNA or to affect proteins that are involved in the transcription\nand translation process [59,61].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18 \n \nSie2009 L. lactis and lactococcal prophages Sie systems [51,52] \nUsing the signal peptide lipoprotein pro-\nphage TP-J34 (LTP) \nProphage of Streptococcus ther-\nmophilus  Sie systems [53] \nUsing MDS enzymes (DpnI for Streptococ-\ncus pneumoniae, McrBC, McrA, and Mrr for \nE. coli) \nStreptococcus pneumoniae, \nE. coli  \nModification-de-\npendent systems \n(MDSs), which de-\ntect the modified \nphage DNA \n[26,54] \nRNA-guided DNA silencing and DNA-\nguided DNA silencing \nIt is available in some bacterial \nspp. \nArgonautes (pA-\ngos) [55] \n2.8.

Passive Mechanisms of Phage Evasion \nIn the case of passive mechanisms of ph age evasion, MTase modifies the double-\nstranded DNA of phages rapidly within a host comprising a R–M system before it is rec-\nognized by the host REase. Thus, the invading phage DNA will be protected from degra-\ndation by R–M systems. Hence, the modified genome of phage can replicate safely in the \nR–M-consisting host cell and can also infect and replicate in other cells which express \nidentical R–M system. Nevertheless, as the R–M system is specific to specific host, the \nsame DNA of a phage can be detected as foreign in a cell consisting of a different R–M \nsystem, and it will, therefore, be degraded by a different REase. In yet another twist, some \nREases of bacterial cell even can detect and degrade modified DNA [68]. \n  \nFigure 10. Schematic representation of phage anti-restriction–modification systems.

Thus, the invading phage DNA will be protected from\ndegradation by R–M systems. Hence, the modified genome of phage can replicate safely in\nthe R–M-consisting host cell and can also infect and replicate in other cells which express\nidentical R–M system. Nevertheless, as the R–M system is specific to specific host, the same\nDNA of a phage can be detected as foreign in a cell consisting of a different R–M system,\nand it will, therefore, be degraded by a different REase. In yet another twist, some REases\nof bacterial cell even can detect and degrade modified DNA [68].\n3.3. Escaping Abortive-Infection Mechanisms\nCertain phages have developed anti-Abi mechanisms to undergo protected replication\nin the targeted host cell [69]. Lactococcus phages are the best example for this counterstrategy.\nMutations of one or more specific genes of the Lactococcus spp. can enable the phages to\nescape the Abi systems [ 70]. Phages from Lactococcus spp., for instance, can bypass the\nAbiQ mechanism by mutating genes involved in nucleotide metabolism. A phage can\nencode a molecule (such as Dmd in coliphage T4) that can replace a bacterial antitoxin,\nthus inhibiting the activity of the bacterial toxin and protecting the cell from death [71]. It\nhas been discovered that the Pectobacterium atrosepticum phage, phiTE, produces pseudo-\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381 13 of 17\nanti-toxin RNA or takes over the antitoxin, ToxI, during its infection to deactivate the ToxN\ntoxin [72].\n3.4. Evading CRISPR–Cas Systems\n3.4.1. Evasion by Mutation\nAn individual nucleotide substitution can enable phages to evade the CRISPR system\nin the protospacer site or in the conserved region adjacent to the protospacer motif [73]. In\ncontrast to phages with multiple mismatches in distal PAM protospacer sites, those with\nsubstitutions near the protospacer-adjacent motif will evade CRISPR targeting [74].\n3.4.2. Evasion by Anti-CRISPR Genes\nCurrent research findings indicated that phages encode anti-CRISPR genes, which are\nactive towards the CRISPR of bacterial defense systems, as it is recognized in Pseudomonas\naeruginosa temperate phages [75]. Some phages encode several anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs)\nthat interfere with the function of different variants of the CRISPR–Cas system [76].\nSome examples of the phage’s counterstrategies towards different phage resistance\nmechanisms that we discussed so far are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Conclusions and Future Directions\nIn this review, we have reviewed a variety of phage resistance mechanisms. These\nantiviral defense systems involved several biomolecules, proteins, enzymes, cellular struc-\ntures, and inter-cellular interactions that protect bacterial cells from lysis and death. The\nbacterial antiphage defense strategies, which are described in this review, reflect the tremen-\ndous diversity of phages, and thus some other resistance mechanisms could be discovered.\nThe study of phage resistance should be scaled up beyond the discovery of the baseline\nmechanism towards the detailed understanding on the molecular root behind these antiviral\nsystems. In this context, advancement in phage biology will certainly be required to\nfully understand the mechanism of phage resistance. Moreover, most studied antiphage\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 381 14 of 17\nsystems were associated with the phages whose genomic matter is double-stranded-DNA.\nResistance mechanisms linked to single-stranded DNA and RNA, or double-stranded\nRNA genomes, as well as other genetically unique phages, are waiting to be investigated.\nIn addition, lysogenic phage mediated resistance mechanisms are less understood, and\ntherefore this gap needs to be filled.\nThe above-mentioned phage resistance strategies are often investigated in a laboratory-\ncontrolled setting, in a single replica, and using a single host–phage model. Nevertheless,\nbacterial pathogens usually comprised multi-lateral antiphage systems. The coexistence of\nthese systems in one host cell has seldom been studied, and the outcome of such interactions\non phage evolution and their community is often overlooked. Likewise, the effectiveness\nof phage resistance strategies towards some families of phages (non Siphoviridae) are not\ncontinually evaluated.\nAs bacteria and phages have ancient co-evolutionary history, phages can profoundly\ngenerate a counter-resistance, via several mechanisms and with small fitness cost. One\nphage may also possess multiple phage resistance systems that may generate strong de-\nfenses over individual systems, allowing specific clonal inhabitants to stay in phage-\ncontaining ecosystems. The phage counteracting strategies enable the phages to undergo\ntheir replication safely and to produce viable progeny virions for the next generation.\nHowever, there are many unexplored mechanisms, cascades of reactions, molecular inter-\nactions, and involvement of newly produced biomolecules that need additional in-depth\ninvestigation for better understanding of phage science. Hence, the limitation of this review\nis that we have presented limited information regarding the mechanisms of action of some\nphage resistance and counterstrategies that have not yet been fully explored.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and contribution to writing, S.H., J.A., A.D.T., T.A., M.G.A.,\nR.R.A.-H., I.Q., A.M.A.-H., R.F.H.

Classic genetic engineering methods depend on \nhomology-dir ected r epair and often combine with phage- \nderi v ed recombinases (e.g. RecET or Lambda Red) ( 4 , 5 ) to \nimprove the recombination efficiency. Unfortunately, these \nmethods often suffer from low efficiency and the most com- \nmonly used Cre / loxP and FLP / FRT systems will leave scars \nin the genome ( 6 , 7 ), hindering their broad applications in \ngenetic engineering. To construct scarless mutant strains \nwith high efficiency, genome-editing tools employing spe- \ncific nucleases have been developed recently. These include \nzinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) ( 8 ), transcription activator- \nlike effector nucleases (TALENs) ( 9 ) and clustered regularly \ninterspaced short palindromic repea t-associa ted nucleases \n(CRISPR) ( 10–12 ). In contrast to ZFNs ( 13 ) and TALENs \n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

As a result, CRISPR has been ra pidl y becom- \ning one of the most commonly used editing methods, with \napplications in almost all kingdoms of life. \nSubstitution mutations are indispensable and are ubiq- \nuitous in natural variation, which can alter the function of \ncoding and regulatory sequences ( 14 , 15 ). In addition, most \ngenetic mutation diseases in humans are caused by substi- \ntution mutations ( 16 ). Howe v er, current genome engineer- \ning tools still have limited abilities to introduce substitution \nmuta tions. The ef ficiency of oligonucleotide-media ted point \nmutations is < 3%, e v en when combined with CRISPR \n( 17 ). To address this challenge, base editors based on the \nCRISPR system have been developed ( 18 ). In this system, \nC to T mutations can be achie v ed with cytosine deami- \nnase (CBE) ( 19 , 20 ), with the adenine base editor (ABE, A \nto G mutations) de v eloped afterwar ds ( 21 ). Howe v er, base \neditors ar e r estricted to some specific nucleotide substitu- \ntions in a short window. To enable all 12 types of substi- \ntutions, prime editor was de v eloped by fusing a catalyt- \nically impaired Cas9 endonuclease to an engineered re- \nverse transcriptase ( 22 ). Although well established in mam- \nmalian cells, prime editor suffers from poor performance \nin prokaryotes (e.g. Esc heric hia coli ), with substitution, in- \nsertion and deletion reported with an editing efficiency of \n6.8%, 12.2% and 26%, respecti v ely ( 23 ). Multiple x auto- \nmated genome engineering (MAGE), enabling nucleotide \nsubstitution with chemically synthesized single-stranded \nDN As (ssDN As), is one of the most efficient methods in \nintroducing substitution mutation ( 24 ). Ne v ertheless, mul- \ntiplex substitutions are introduced in multiple rounds of ss- \nDNA transforma tion and automa tion devices are generally \nr equir ed. \nCompared with the introduction of chemically synthe- \nsized ssDNAs in vitro , the generation of ssDNAs in vivo \nis expected to benefit recombineering-based genome edit- \ning, such as higher editing efficiency and easier manipula- \ntion. The retron cassette from E. coli BL21 is such a rep- \nresentati v e e xample tha t can genera te m ulti-copy ssDN As \n(msDNAs) in vivo ( 25 ). Retrons are found to mediate anti- \nphage defense in bacteria ( 26 ) and the structure and defense \nmechanisms have been elucidated recently ( 27 ). Retron ms- \nDNAs can generate functional recombineering donors to \nintroduce specific mutations (Supplementary Table S1), but \nthe editing efficiency was reported to be low ( 28 , 29 ). Re- \ncently, by introducing a stronger ribosomal binding site \n(RBS) to ov ere xpress the single-stranded annealing protein \n(SSAP) bet from Lambda phage ( 30 ), HiSCRIBE (high- \nefficiency Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biolog- \nical Events) increased editing efficiency up to 60%. In addi- \ntion, r etron library r ecombineering (RLR) was r eported to \ngenerate pooled and barcoded variant libraries with high ef- \nficiency ( 31 ). Howe v er, the retron system is still not system- \natically optimized, with an editing frequency of 3 × 10 −7 \nfor simultaneous two-locus editing ( 28 ), limiting their ap- \nplications in modifying se v eral single nucleotide polymor- \nphisms at a time to treat a genetic disease ( 19 ), regulating \nmany endogenous genes at once to trigger changes in cel- \nlular phenotype ( 32 ) or optimizing complex metabolic reg- \nulatory networks ( 24 ). Considering the continuous editing \ncapability, the retron system is expected to enable multiplex \ngenome editing. \nIn this work, we establish an efficient retron-mediated \ngenome editing system (REGES) in E. coli (Figure 1 ). We \nfirst optimize the retron system in a modular and systematic \nmanner, and the incorporation frequency of mutations was \nincreased to ∼100% for genomic substitutions , insertions , \ndeletions as well as their combinations. In addition, by as- \nsembling an array of retron cassettes, we employ REGES \nfor multiplex genome editing and can edit four genes with \nan efficiency of 25 ± 14%, r epr esenting the highest number \nof precise substitutions to be introduced in a single round of \ngenome editing in E. coli . We then demonstrate REGES for \nthe construction of pooled and barcoded variant libraries \nwith degenerate RBS sequences to fine-tune the expression \nle v el of endogenous and exogenous genes, such as tran- \nscription factors to construct ethanol resistant strains and \nbiotin-overproducing strains. Finally, we explored the capa- \nbility of REGES for continuous in vivo protein evolution, \nvia the combination of retron, ortho gonal m utagenic RN A \npolymerase and cytidine deaminase to introduce random \nmutagenesis during the replication and transcription stages \nof in vivo ssDNA generation. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nMaterials and cultivation conditions \nUnless specifically mentioned, strains were cultivated at \n37 ◦C, and genome editing experiments were performed at \n30 ◦C. MacConkey agar medium (peptone 20 g l −1 , bile salts \n1.5 g l −1 , sodium chloride 5 g l −1 , agar 13.5 g l −1 , neutral \nred 0.03 g l −1 and crystal violet 0.001 g l −1 ) was used to \ndetermine the editing efficiency of galK mutations. Antibi- \notics, when needed, were added at the following concentra- \ntions: ampicillin, 100 mg l −1 ; chloramphenicol, 34 mg l −1 ; \nkanamycin, 50 mg l −1 ; spectinomycin, 50 mg l −1 ; strepto- \nmycin, 25 mg l −1 and sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% v / v. \nPCR was performed with the high-fidelity enzyme PrimeS- \nTAR ® Max DN A Pol ymer ase (Takar a, Tok yo , Japan). \nOligonucleotides were synthesized by TSINGKE Biologi- \ncal Technology (Hangzhou, China). All chemicals were pur- \nchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). \nStrain construction \nE. coli strains used in this study were listed in Supplemen- \ntary Table S2. DH5 /H9251(F −end A1 sup E44 thi -1 r ecA 1 r elA 1 \ngyr A96 deoR phoA /Phi1 80d lacZ /Delta1 M15 /Delta1 ( lac ZYA- arg F) \nU169, hsdR 17 (rK −, mK + ), /H9261−) was used for plasmid con- \nstruction, and WT MG1655 (F − /H9261−ilvG −rfb -50 rph -1) was \nused as the parental strain for REGES. All the basic strains \nin this study were constructed by CRISPR / Cas9 with the \npTargetT and pCas system as previously described ( 11 ). To \nconstruct the /Delta1 recJ , /Delta1 mutS , /Delta1 xonA and /Delta1 xseA strains, \nDNA fragments including 500-bp upstream and 500-bp \ndownstr eam wer e PCR amplified and assembled to generate \ndonor DNAs. With the help of specific sgRNA expressed \nby pTargetT, recJ , mutS , xonA and xseA were individually \nknocked out in MG1655. MG06 ( /Delta1 recJ /Delta1 xonA ) was con- \nstructed by knocking out recJ in MG04 ( /Delta1 xonA ).

( C ) Through the design of in vivo generated ssDNAs, REGES enables versatile synthetic biology and metabolic en- \ngineering applications, such as precise genome editing (substitution, insertion and / or deletion), multiplex genome editing, ssDNA pool with degenerate \nRBS sequences for regulating the expression of endogenous and exogenous genes as well as ssDNA pool with random mutations for continuous in vivo \nprotein evolution. \nand MG11 were obtained by assembly of the mutant se- \nquences of each gene ( galK off , gfp off , rfp off and cat off ) with \ntheir upstream and downstream sequences. Transformants \nwere verified by colony PCR and DNA sequencing. \nPlasmid cloning \nAll constructs, template sequences and primers used in \nthis study are listed in Supplementary Tables S3–S5. Plas- \nmids were constructed by digestion / ligation, Gibson assem- \nbly or Golden-Gate assembly. The REGES editing plas- \nmids expressing msr, msd, RT and SSAP was constructed \nas following: the WT retron cassette (Ec86) expressing msr , \nmsd and RT was amplified from the genome of BL21(DE3). \nThe bet gene was amplified from pKD46 (Novagen). The \nretron cassette and bet were assembled into a medium copy- \nnumber plasmid pET28a to construct pRE01. The tem- \nplate sequences for ssDNA production were inserted into \n8296 Nucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 \npRE01 between the Eco R I (New England Biolabs, Ip- \nswich, MA) and Hind III sites. CspRecT , I- Sce I, pro- \nmoter sequences, 5 ′ UTR sequences and replicons were \nchemically synthesized by TSINGKE Biological Technol- \nogy (Hangzhou, China). All plasmids harboring various \ntargeting sequences were cloned into Eco R I and Hin d III \nrestriction sites. To construct multiplex editing plasmid, tar- \nget plasmids (pRE13, pRE22) without RT and bet were first \nconstructed. The replacement of promoter and terminator \nwas performed by Gibson assembly. The reaction mixture \nwas then purified and added to 100 /H9262l DH5 /H9251competent \ncells, and electroporation was done in a 2-mm Gene Pulser \ncuvette (Bio-rad) under 2.5 kV, 25 /H9262F and 200 /Omega1. After- \nwards, 800 /H9262l of SOC liquid medium was added to recover \nthe cells at 37 ◦C. After about 1 h, the transformants were \nplated onto LB solid medium containing the correspond- \ning antibiotics. \nGenome editing by REGES \nUnless otherwise mentioned, the heat shock transformation \nmethod was used to transform editing plasmids to the cor- \nresponding E. coli strains. Competent cells were prepared \naccording to the method as previously described ( 33 ). For \nediting in liquid medium, a single colony was inoculated \nto 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 mg l −1 kanamycin \nand 1 mM IPTG. After editing for ∼16 h, the mixed culture \nwas streak out onto agar plate to isolate mono-clones. Al- \nternati v ely, for editing in solid medium, E. coli strains were \nspread onto agar plates containing 50 mg l −1 kanamycin \nand 1 mM IPTG. After 16 h of growth, single colonies were \nisolated for genotyping analysis. \nEditing efficiency assay \nThe galK re v ersion assa y was perf ormed as previously de- \nscribed ( 28 ). Briefly, strains after editing were plated onto \nMacConkey agar plates containing 50 mg l −1 kanamycin. \nThe galK mutation efficiency was calculated by calculating \nthe ratio of purple colonies to the total number of colonies. \nIn the gfp and rfp re v ersion assay, strains after editing were \nplated on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin. \nThe editing efficiency was the percentage of strains show- \ning gr een fluor escence (or r ed fluor escence). The editing fr e- \nquency of rpsL conversion was determined by plating cells \non LB agar plates with or without streptomycin and calcu- \nlating the ratio of str eptomycin-r esistant strains (plates with \nstreptomycin) to the total number (plates without strepto- \nmycin). For cat reversion assay, cultures were spotted on LB \nagar plates with or without chloramphenicol, and the ra- \ntio of chloramphenicol-resistant strains to the total number \nwas determined. The tolC editing efficiency was calculated \nby the ratio of SDS-sensiti v e strains to the total number. In \naddition to the phenotype-based validation, genome editing \nr esults wer e further verified by diagnostic PCR and Sanger \nsequencing. \nRegulation of RFP expression and fluorescence intensity \nmeasurement \nDNA containing degenerate RBS sequences \n(NNNNNNNNNNN) flanked by homologous regions on \neach side was synthesized and ligated into the Eco R I and \nHin d III sites of pRE15 to generate the pool of editing \nplasmid. After editing for 16 h, E. coli strains were spread \ninto agar plates, and single colonies were picked, inoculated \nand cultured in 96-well plates overnight. To measure the \nfluorescence intensity, E. coli strains were washed twice, \ndiluted in sterile water and measured at 555–584 nm. The \nfluorescence intensity (relati v e fluorescence units; RFU) \nwas normalized to cell density (OD 600 ). \nRegulation of IscR expression and isolation of iscR mutant \nstrains \nBarcoded plasmid library prepared as above was electropo- \nrated into BL21(DE3) △  recJ △  xonA / pAra-bioB-pMB1 and \nplated on LB plates with 1 mM IPTG. After 16 h of editing, \nthe resultant colonies were scraped from the plates. Selec- \ntion was performed by diluting the cell culture 100-fold into \n5 ml LB with 100 mM arabinose to induce bioB ov ere xpres- \nsion to the cytotoxicity le v el. After isolating single colonies \nof the viable strains, they were picked for further character- \nization of biotin production capacity. \nQuantification of biotin production \nBition quantification was performed as previously de- \nscribed with few modifications using Lactobacillus plan- \ntarum ATCC8014 as the biotin reporter strain ( 34 ). Sample \nsupernatant was diluted ∼5000-fold and then mixed with \nthe bioassay medium in a microtiter pla te. Pla tes were in- \ncuba ted a t dark a t 37 ◦C for 24 h. OD 600 was measured \nand biotin concentration was calculated using the standard \ncurve with known concentration of biotin in the bioassay \nmedium. \nPlasmid elimination assay \nStrains were inoculated into 5 ml of LB liquid medium con- \ntaining arabinose. After culturing at 37 ◦C for 1-9 h the di- \nluted culture was spread onto an antibiotic-free LB solid \nmedium and incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. Colonies were \nthen picked to kanamycin-containing and kanamycin-free \nplates to test their sensitivity to kanamycin. The elimination \nefficiency of the donor plasmids was determined based on \nthe ratio of kanamy cin-sensiti v e strains to the total number \nof E. coli strains. Plasmid elimination was further verified \nby diagnostic PCR with specific primers. \nConstruction of lycopene-producing strains and quantifica- \ntion of lycopene production \nAfter simultaneous editing of multiple genomic loci, E. \ncoli strains were spread onto LB agar plates containing \nkanamy cin. The multiple x editing efficiency was determined \nby diagnostic PCR with specific primers and further verified \nby Sanger sequencing. After elimination of the editing plas- \nmids, pAC-lyc containing the lycopene biosynthetic path- \nw ay w as transformed to enab le ly copene production ( 24 ). \nLy copene e xtraction and quantification was performed as \npreviously described with few modifications ( 24 ). 1 ml of \ncells were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 1 min and washed \nNucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 8297 \ntwice with PBS buffer. The resultant cell pellets were re- \nsuspended in 300 /H9262l of acetone and incuba ted a t 55 ◦C for \n15 min. After centrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 1 min, the ab- \nsorbance of the supernatant was measured at 470 nm with \na Varioskan Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Scientific, \nWaltham, USA). Cell dry weight (DCW) was calculated \nbased on a conversion coefficient of 0.36 for DCW / OD \n( 35 , 36 ). The lycopene yield of all strains was normalized to \nDCW. \nEvolution of sacB and viability assay \nThe mutator plasmid (Mutator-DNA or Mutator-RNA) \nand editing plasmid (pRsacB) were co-transformed \ninto MG14. Cells harboring these plasmids were grown \novernight in 5 ml of LB supplemented with chloram- \nphenicol and kanamycin. The overnight cultures (50 /H9262l) \nwer e mix ed with 5 ml of LB supplemented with chloram- \nphenicol, kanamycin, 1 mM IPTG and 100 mM arabinose \nand incuba ted a t 30 ◦C for 8 hours (Cycle#1). The 1 / 100 \ndilution-incubation cycle was repeated, and samples were \ntaken at the end of each cycle. To determine the mutation \nra te of sacB , cells a t each cycle were serial 10-fold diluted \nand then spotted onto selecti v e (10 g l −1 sucrose) or nonse- \nlecti v e (no sucrose) plates. The number of sucrose-resistant \nstrains as a percentage of the total number of cells was \ncalcula ted. Muta tions in sacB were further determined by \nSanger sequencing. \nStatistics and reproducibility \nAll experimental data were at least in triplicate and ex- \npressed as mean ± standard error. All data analyses were \nperformed by Excel or OriginPro. \nRESULTS \nDesign of REGES for multiplex genome editing and evolution \nRetrons are encoded as a polycistronic transcriptional cas- \nsette, which contains a promoter, an msr (including a prim- \ning guanosine residue), an msd , self-complementary regions \n(5 ′ repeat and 3 ′ repeat), an RBS for translating re v erse \ntranscriptase (RT), an RT, an RBS for translating SSAP, \nan SSAP and a terminator (Figure 1 A). After transcrip- \ntion, the msr-msd RNA folds into a secondary structure, \nwhich can be recognized by RT. Then RT uses the guanosine \nresidue in msr as a priming site to re v erse transcribe the msr \nsequence and produce a hybrid RN A–ssDN A molecule. We \ncan insert templates (donor sequence) into msd to gener- \nate multi-copy ssDNAs that will subsequently be incorpo- \nrated into the targeted genes (Figure 1 A). To improve the \nrecombineering efficiency in E. coli , we introduced bet , an \nSSAP from Lambda phage ( 37 ) to bind ssDNA fragments \nand anneal complementary sequences. Using standard syn- \nthetic biology parts, key parameters of REGES including \nhost, retron bioparts and editing conditions can be opti- \nmized in a modular and systematic manner (Figure 1 B). \nThe high efficiency of REGES enables a series of synthetic \nbiology and metabolic engineering applications. First, the \nproduction of ssDNAs with desired mutations enables pre- \ncise genome editing, while ssDNA molecules targeted to \nmultiple loci can be employed for multiplex genome edit- \ning. Additionall y, ssDN A pools can facilitate the genera- \ntion of pooled and barcoded variant libraries, such as de- \ngenerate RBS sequences to fine-tune the expression level \nof endogenous and exogenous genes for strain engineering \npurposes. Finally, the incorporation of ssDNA pools with \nrandom mutations (through DNA-dependent transcription \nand RNA-dependent re v erse transcription) can be utilized \nfor gene-specific, continuous in vivo evolution (Figure 1 C). \nSystematic optimization of REGES for efficient genome \nediting \nTo facilitate the identification of the desired editing e v ents, \nwe constructed a reporter strain MG01 by introducing two \ncontinuous pr ematur e stop codons (L187*-L188*) in the \ngalactokinase encoding gene ( galK ). On the MacConkey \nplate, strains with the function of galK r ecover ed will \nturn purple ( 30 , 38 ). For the initially constructed lac-dri v en \nretron editing system, we could not detect any target edits \non the MacConkey pla te, indica ting tha t the editing ef fi- \nciency was less than 0.1% (Figure 2 A and Supplementary \nFigure S1A). In previous studies, the efficiency of ssDNA- \nbased recombination could be improved by removing nucle- \nase genes (e.g. xseA , recJ and xonA ) for the degradation of \nexo genous DN As ( 39–42 ) as well as mismatch repair gene \nmutS ( 39 ) . To explore these strategies in REGES, we con- \nstructed a series of strains with xseA , recJ , xonA and mutS \nbeing individually knocked out. The knockout of xseA ( 42 ), \nan ssDNA-specific exonuclease responsible for converting \nlarge ssDNA substrates into smaller oligonucleotides, no \nenhancement in recombinant efficiency was observed (Fig- \nure 2 B). On the other hand, we found that the inactiva- \ntion of xonA or recJ , encoding 3 ′ or 5 ′ ssDNA exonucle- \nases ( 39 ), respecti v el y, significantl y improved the editing ef- \nficiency (Figure 2 B), w hose sim ultaneous deletion increased \nthe editing efficiency by ∼130-fold over the original sys- \ntem (Figure 2 B). We observed no significant differences in \nthe mutS deficient strain (Figure 2 B), indica ting tha t MutS \ndoes not recognize sequences with insertions or mismatches \nlarger than 4 nucleotides ( 43 ). Although the precise mech- \nanism of retron is still unclear ( 44–46 ), our results showed \nssDNAs were hybridized to the lagging strand of the repli- \ncation fork, which is akin to the Lambda Red recombi- \nnation mechanism ( 47 ). Accordingl y, ssDN As targeting to \nthe lagging strand of galK achie v ed an editing frequency \nof 15 ± 3%, which was ∼300-fold higher than that to the \nleading strand (0.05 ± 0.03%, Figure 2 B). Thus, according \nto the genome coordinate, we come to some basic rules to \ndesign the template sequences of REGES (Supplementary \nFigure S1B). \nTo further improve genome editing efficiency, we sys- \ntematically optimized each module of REGES at replica- \ntion (plasmid copy numbers), transcription (promoter ac- \ntivities) and translation (RBS strengths) levels. We achieved \nan editing efficiency (i.e. proportions of purple cells) of \n29 ± 6% when p15A ( ∼5–10 copies) was used. In con- \ntrast, plasmids with pMB1 ( ∼20–40 copies) and pUC \n( ∼600 copies) resulted in editing frequencies of 13 ± 4% \nand 7 ± 3%, respecti v ely (Figure 2 B). To further match \nthe recombination capacity with the re v erse transcription \n8298 Nucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 \nFigure 2.

The best perf ormance f or \neach parameter was labelled with a red arrow. \nef ficiency, we evalua ted 11 RBSs ( 48 , 49 ) with different \ntransla tion initia tion ra te (Supplementary Figure S2A) for \nthe expression of bet from Lambda phage. Interestingly, \nBCDd with medium strength resulted in the highest edit- \ning efficiency (34 ± 4%, Figure 2 B), indicating that the \ne xpression le v el of bet should be carefully fine-tuned. Fi- \nnally, we regulated the transcription of the retron cassette \ndri v en by eight promoters ( 49 ) of different strengths (Sup- \nplementary Figure S2B). As shown in Figure 2 B, we could \nachie v e ∼100% editing when the strong IPTG-responsi v e \nF AB45, F AB46 and F AB95 were used, indica ting tha t \nhigh expression of the retron system was beneficial for \nREGES. \nBased on the optimized REGES, we set to evaluate the \nediting efficiency for a full set of possible engineering events, \nincluding substitution, insertion and deletion. While we \nachie v ed high efficiency for deletion and substitution, the \ninsertion efficiency was much lower (Figure 3 A), which has \nbeen reported for other ssDNA-mediated recombineering \nsystems such as MAGE ( 24 , 41 ). Interestingl y, w hen the edit- \ning length is < 3 nucleotides, the genome editing efficiency \nwas drama tically af fected, probably due to the recognition \nand repair of the mutations by mutS of the MMR system \n( 43 ). \nWe then employed REGES to edit more target genes re- \nlated to important phenotypes in E. coli. For example, the \nmutant RpsL (K43R) conferring E. coli str eptomycin r e- \nsistance ( 50 ) was obtained with an efficiency of 91 ± 9% \n(Figur e 3 B). Mor e importantly, gfp (encoding gr een fluo- \nrescent protein), rfp (encoding red fluorescent protein) and \ntolC (encoding outer membrane channel) were edited with \nan efficiency of 74 ± 7%, 94 ± 4% and 62 ± 4%, respec- \nti v ely (Figure 3 B). We evaluated the ability of REGES for \ncombina torial muta tions, such as substitution with deletion \n(tested for both gfp and rfp ) and substitution with insertion \n(tested for tolC ), which resulted in 62 ± 4% to 94 ± 4% \nediting efficiency (Figure 3 B). These results demonstrated \nthe power and versatility of REGES for genome editing in \nE. coli . \nThe last element for optimization was the donor of \nREGES (also known as the guide sequences). By placing \nmuta tions in dif ferent positions of the template sequences, \nwe found positions from 20 to 55 in the ssDNAs to be op- \ntimal for genome editing (Figure 3 C). Although increasing \ndonor length was expected to provide more homology for \nannealing, we are surprised to find that larger donor im- \npaired genome editing efficiency significantl y, particularl y \nwhen larger than 300 bp (Supplementary Figure S2C).

Error bars r epr esented standard errors of three biological replicates. \nother words, we should keep the guide sequences shorter \nthan 300 bp to achie v e efficient genome editing in E. coli . \nIn addition, we optimized inducer concentration (Supple- \nmentary Figure S2D), editing time (Supplementary Fig- \nure S2E) and editing temperature (Supplementary Figure \nS2F) to maximize REGES ef ficiency. After systema tic ex- \nploration, we summarized the optimal parameters for the \nbest performance of REGES in Table 1 . Briefly, retron \ncassette is transcribed by a strong promoter (e.g. FAB45, \nFAB46 and FAB95), with the translation of bet initiated by \na medium-strength RBS (e.g. BCDd). The optimal window \nfor REGES is less than 300 bp, with the mutation site ide- \nally positioned in the middle of the donor. To induce ss- \nDNA production and continuous editing, IPTG is added at \na concentration of 1 mM and genome editing is performed \nat 30 ◦C for 16 h. \nAfter systema tic optimiza tion, we aimed to explore the \nmaxim um ca pacity of REGES. Generall y, extended donor \nsequences allow for a broader spectrum of insertions or sub- \nstitutions at specific positions within the target gene, but ex- \ncessi v ely long donor sequences were found to result in de- \ncreased editing efficiency of REGES (Supplementary Fig- \nure S2C). Considering that a donor of 200 bp achie v ed \nan editing efficiency of 87 ± 8% (Supplementary Figure \nS2C), we adopted this length for maximum capacity eval- \nuation.

Howe v er, we failed to detect any desired modification \nwhen attempting to insert a 140 bp random fragment (from \nsacB ) into the galK locus. Ne v ertheless, we could insert a \n100 bp fragment with low efficiency (Figure 3 D). For sub- \nstitutions, we achie v ed a muta tion ef ficiency of 6 ± 2% when \ntrying to substitute a 140 bp random sequence (from sacB ) \nwith the same size in galK (Figure 3 D). Notably, the effi- \nciency of generating a substitution or deletion modification \n8300 Nucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 \nis correlated with the size of the mutation. We achie v ed an \nefficiency of 27 ± 5% for the deletion of ∼300 bp. Although \nwith extremely low editing efficiency, we could successfully \ndelete up to 5000 bp sequences (Figure 3 D). \nREGES for multiplex genome editing \nAfter systematic optimization, we then tested the perfor- \nmance of REGES for multiplex genome editing, which \nwas highly desirable for synthetic biology and metabolic \nengineering applications. To minimize repetiti v e DNA se- \nquences ( 32 ), we used two different REGES constructs, \nFAB45-retron and FAB46-retron, and T7 terminator of the \nfirst REGES cassette was replaced with L2U5H11 termi- \nna tor ( 51 ). W hen multiple r etron cassettes wer e arranged as \ntandem arrays, these two different constructs were used se- \nquentially, leading to reduced homology between the adja- \ncent expression cassettes. For two-locus editing, we chose \nrpsL and gfp as the reporter genes, which were simulta- \nneously edited with an efficiency of 85 ± 3%. By assem- \nbling another REGES cassette targeting galK , we achie v ed \nthree-locus ( rpsL - gfp - galK ) editing with an efficiency of \n69 ± 7%. After the inclusion of a fourth REGES cas- \nsette targeting cat , we observed four-editing e v ents with \nan efficiency of 25 ± 14% (Figure 4 A), r epr esenting the \nmaximal number of precise mutations to be introduced \nin a single round of genome editing in E. coli . The edit- \ning efficiency of each gene in the multiplex editing sys- \ntem was shown in Supplementary Figures S3A, S3B, S3C \nand S3D, respecti v ely. To facilitate continuous or itera- \nti v e genome editing, we incorporated an I- Sce I-mediated \n( 52 ) plasmid curing system (Supplementary Figure S3E). \nSpecifically, the expression of the homing endonuclease \nI- Sce I, which recognized and cleaved a specific recog- \nnition sequence (T AGGGAT AACAGGGT AAT) to intro- \nduce double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) into the retron \nplasmid, was tightly controlled by an arabinose-inducible \npromoter. The system enabled ∼100% plasmid elimina- \ntion after 3 h of induction by arabinose (Supplementary \nFigure S3F). \nFor practical applications, we employed REGES and the \nplasmid elimination system for the construction of lycopene \noverproducing strains (Figure 4 B). Based on previous stud- \nies, the combination of idi , dxs and ytjC engineering or \nthe combination of dxs , idi , dxr , rpoS and ytjC engineer- \ning were determined to be the most effecti v e in increas- \ning lycopene production ( 24 ). We constructed and intro- \nduced pRE31 to knock down ytjC , and eight out of nine \ncolonies were found to harbor the expected mutations (Fig- \nure 4 C). After induction of the I- Sce I system to elimi- \nnate the donor plasmid, the resultant strain MG13 was \nfurther transformed with pRE-multi-2E or pRE-multi-4F, \nwhich were expected to perform dxs - idi double mutations \nor idi - dxr - rpoS - dxs quadruple mutations (Figure 4 B). For \nthe dual-editing e v ent, REGES reached efficiencies up to \n∼100% (Figure 4 D); for the quadruple mutation assay, \nREGES reached efficiencies up to 18 ± 9% (Figure 4 E). In \naddition, we found that all the selected colonies ( ∼100%) \nwere edited at least twice, and 60 ± 14% were edited in at \nleast three loci (Figure 4 E). DNA sequencing results showed \nthat both strains were precisely edited at all the predeter- \nmined loci (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). Com- \npared with the control strain, lycopene production was in- \ncreased by 3.9-fold and 4.5-fold in the two-locus editing \nstrain and four-locus editing strain, respecti v ely (Supple- \nmentary Figure S4C). Notably, it only took us two days \nto construct a high-yield lycopene producing strain har- \nboring fiv e-locus muta tions, indica ting the ef ficiency and \ntime saving of REGES for the construction of microbial cell \nfactories. \nREGES for the generation of pooled and barcoded variant \nlibraries \nAs REGES can efficiently introduce mutations in a rela- \nti v ely wide window, we propose REGES to incorporate a \npooled and barcoded library with the desirable mutations \ninto the E. coli genome. For example, we can incorporate \na library of degenerate RBS sequences to regulate the ex- \npression le v el of endogenous and e xogenous genes (Fig- \nure 5 A). As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a reporter \nstrain MG09 with the RFP expression cassette (harboring \nthe original RBS sequences from pET-RBS, TAA GAA G- \nGAGA) integrated into the genome. We inserted degener- \nate RBS sequences (NNNNNNNNNNN) flanked by 34 bp \nupstream and 33 bp downstream homologous regions of rfp \ninto msd to generate a pooled and barcoded retron library. \nAfter transforming the retron library and editing, we ran- \ndomly picked colonies for fluorescence measurement and \nobserved an expression range of ∼208-fold (Supplementary \nFigure S5A). Despite the strong translational capacity of \npET-RBS, the expression level of RFP could still be en- \nhanced by up to 1.6-fold via REGES-mediated RBS engi- \nneering (Figure 5 B). \nFor practical applications, we chose to regulate the ex- \npression le v el of transcriptional factors. In previous stud- \nies, global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) has \nbeen found to enable the engineering of complex regula- \ntory networks and used to increase protein expression ( 53 ), \nmetabolite production ( 54 ) and stress resistance ( 55 ) via \ndirected evolution. We proposed that modulating the ex- \npression of global transcription factors could also generate \nglobal di v ersity of transcription le v els and be employed for \nstrain engineering purposes. Here, we constructed retron li- \nbraries for fine-tuning the expression level of seven global \ntranscription factors, including CRP (cyclic AMP receptor \nprotein), FNR (fumarate and nitrate reduction regulatory \npr otein), ArcA (aer obic respiration control regulator), IHF \n(integration host factor), HNS (histone-like nucleoid struc- \nturing protein), Fis (factor f or in version stimulation) and \nLRP (leucine responsi v e regulatory protein) ( 56 , 57 ), and \nchose ethanol tolerance as the target phenotype for engi- \nneering. Among these se v en mutant libraries, we found the \nFNR mutant library enabled the grown of E. coli strains in \nhigh concentration of ethanol (50 g l −1 , Figure 5 C and Sup- \nplementary Figure S5B), after which six mutant strains were \npicked for further characterization. To evaluate the strength \nof the RBS mutants, we fused the 5 ′ 36-nt of FNR to the 5 ′ \nend of eGFP ( 48 ) and found that all six constructs confer- \nring ethanol resistance expressed lower le v els of FNR than \nthat of the wild-type (WT) strain (Figure 5 C). Although \nthere has been no report on improving ethanol tolerance by \nNucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 8301 \nFigure 4. REGES for multiplex genome editing.

Red arrows r epr esented the size of the target bands. \nengineering of FNR, our results clearly demonstrated that \nFNR r epr ession enabled higher ethanol tolerance in E. coli . \nAdditionally, the retron itself can serve as a barcode (unique \nRBS sequence), allowing for direct analysis of mutants \nfrom the screened libraries by sequencing the retron plas- \nmids using uni v ersal primers. Our REGES-based global \ntranscription engineering provides advantages in establish- \ning genotype and phenotype relationships of the mutant \nstrains. \nAfter successfully demonstrating REGES in an E. coli \nK strain (MG1655), we extended the applications in the \ngenome editing and global transcription engineering of an \nE. coli B strain, BL21(DE3). We aimed to increase the \nproduction of biotin, a high-value vitamin metabolite with \nbroad applica tions. W hile the final step of biosynthesis \npathway, encoded by the bioB gene, is the bottlenecke for \nbiotin production ( 58 ), its ov ere xpression dramatically in- \nhibits cell gr owth, pr obably due to the depletion of FeS- \ncluster ( 58 ). As IscR is a global regulator responsible for \nthe assembly of FeS-cluster, we constructed a retron library \nto precisely regulate the expression le v el of IscR. As shown \nin Figure 5 D, the ov ere xpression of bioB completely inhib- \nited cell growth when the inducer arabinose was higher than \n50 mM. Luckily, cell growth could be rescued by the intro- \nduction of the retron library (Supplementary Figure S5C), \nindica ting tha t the supply of FeS-cluster was enhanced in \nthe IscR-engineered strains to minimize the cytotoxicity of \nbioB ov ere xpression. Based on the growth-associated selec- \ntion, we successfully obtained se v eral biotin ov erproducing \nstrains (Supplementary Figure S5D and Figure 5 E). DNA \nsequencing results verified mutations in the RBS sequences \n(Supplementary Figure S5E), which were introduced by \nREGES. In addition, we found a correlation between im- \nprov ed IscR e xpr ession and incr eased biotin production, \nwith maximum titers reaching almost 900 /H9262g l −1 in M9 min- \nimal media (Figure 5 E). \n8302 Nucleic Acids Research, 2023, Vol. 51, No. 15 \nFigure 5.

Unlike most of previous ssDNA-mediated \ngenome editing and evolution systems (e.g. MAGE), where \nssDNAs were synthesized and di v ersified in vitro , ssDNAs \nof REGES are generated through DNA-dependent tran- \nscription and RNA-dependent re v erse transcription in vivo . \nThis means that by introducing random mutations into \nthe DNA templates and / or RNA templates used to gener- \nate ssDNAs, we can achie v e continuous in vivo evolution \nof any selected proteins. T7 RN A pol ymerase (T7 RN AP) \nguided base editing ( 59 ) and eMutaT7 ( 60 ), which were \nconstructed by fusing cytidine deaminase to T7 RNAP, \nhave been demonstrated to enable in vivo random mutage- \nnesis (Mutator-DNA). Additionally, err or-pr one T7RNAP \n(epT7RNAP) ( 61 ) has been reported to introduce random \nmutations to the transcribed RNAs (Mutator-RNA) with a \nfrequency of ∼2 × 10 −3 . Therefore, we designed and estab- \nlished an orthogonal transcription system for REGES (Fig- \nur e 6 A), wher e the transcription of msr and msd were dri v en \nby an epT7RNAP fused with a cytidine deaminase from \nPetr om yz on marinus (PmCDA1-epT7RNAP). This enabled \nthe introduction of in vivo random mutations to the DNA \ntemplate and RNA molecule, both of which could be in- \ncorporated into the generated ssDNAs for protein evolu- \ntion applications. For convenient detection of mutagenesis \nand evaluation of mutation rate, we constructed a reporter \nstrain by integrating a model counter-selection gene sacB \ninto the genome. The resultant strain could only grow on \nsucrose when sacB was inactivated ( 62 ). \nWe initiated mutagenesis by adding arabinose and IPTG \nto the recombinant strains carrying the mutator plasmids \nand editing plasmid pRsacB. After four cycles of editing, \nwe spread the mutated cells onto agar plates with or with- \nout sucrose. Compared with the control strains (Figure \n6 B), we found that strains expressing pRsacB and Mutator- \nDNA showed an increased mutation frequency, with an es- \ntima ted muta tion ra te of 2.7 ± 0.5 × 10 −5 (Figure 6 C). Al- \nthough functional, the Mutator-DNA based evolution effi- \nciency was low, probably due to the relati v el y low m utation \nrate ( 60 ) and limited mutation space of PmCDA1 ( 19 ). On \nthe other hand, Muta tor-RNA genera ted sucrose-resistant \nclones at a frequency of 1.3 ± 0.56 × 10 −4 (Figure 6 C), \nwhich was lower than that reported for epT7RNAP ( 61 ). \nThe mutation frequency was probab ly negati v ely affected \nby the decreased transcriptional activity of epT7RNAP, \nwhich has been reported in other systems as well ( 29 ). \nWe further improved the mutagenesis efficiency via com- \nbining Mutator-DNA and Mutator-RNA (i.e. PmCDA1- \nepT7RNAP), resulting in an editing frequency of up to \n2.4 ± 0.076 × 10 −3 (Figure 6 C). The resultant mutation \nrate was ∼1000-fold higher than that of the control strain, \nindicating a synergistic effect between Mutator-DNA and \nMutator-RNA for introducing random mutagenesis and \ncontinuous in vivo evolution. \nWe expected the variants in the sucrose medium to pos- \nsess mutations decreasing the activity of sacB. After geno- \ntyping the sacB gene from ∼50 colonies, we found Q230, \nY237 and D247 to be mutated with high frequency (Fig- \nure 6 B and Supplementary Figure S6A). As shown in \nFigure 6 D, the mutation at Q230 caused a pr ematur e stop \ncodon to inactivate sacB; Y237 was recently reported to af- \nfect ca talytic ef ficiency of this enzyme via site-directed mu- \ntagenesis studies ( 63 ); D247 was located at the acti v e site \nof sacB and its mutation resulted in a 75- to 3500-fold de- \ncrease of K cat ( 64 ). To assess any potential off-target muta- \ngenesis effects on the genome, we determined the rifampicin \nr esistance fr equency of E. coli strains with or without muta- \ntors. We found no significant difference between the control \nand mutator strains (Supplementary Figure S6B), indicat- \ning that genome-wide off-target mutagenesis should not be \na major concern for REGES mediated continuous in vivo \nmutagenesis. \nDISCUSSION \nSignificant progress in bacterial genome manipulation has \nbeen made in recent years. In particular, the CRISPR sys- \ntem has revolutionized genome editing and served as the \nmost successful tool for targeted mutagenesis in E. coli . \nCompared with the CRISPR-mediated genome editing (in- \ncluding base editor and prime editor) ( 23 , 65 ) and ssDNA- \nmedia ted recombina tion (such as MAGE) ( 24 ), REGES \nestablished in the present study demonstrates advantages \nin high editing ef ficiency, easy manipula tion ( in vivo gen- \neration of ssDNAs) and fle xib le mutagenesis ranges. We \nachie v ed ∼100%, 85 ± 3%, 69 ± 14% and 25 ± 14% effi- \nciency for single-, two-, three and four-locus editing of E. \ncoli genome, respecti v el y. More importantl y, the editing re- \ngion of REGES is determined by the in vi vo gener ated ss- \nDNA donor, allowing for fle xib le editing of any selected \nrange and a relati v ely broad editing window, particularly \nwhen compared with base editor and prime editor. \nW hile retron-media ted genome editing systems have been \nestablished in recent years, the editing efficiency remains \nunsatisfactory (Supplementary Table S1). For example, the \nability of retron to write multiple mutations into inde- \npendent loci was explored in SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular \nRecorders Integrating Biological Events), but only a limited \nnumber of colonies ( ∼3 × 10 −7 ) were found to possess two- \nlocus writing e v ents ( 28 ). As the WT retron cassette from \nE. coli BL21 is not efficient enough ( 29–31 ), we optimized \nREGES for maximal editing performance in a modular \nand systematic manner. After systematic optimization, in- \ncluding host modification ( recJ and xonA knockout) to in- \ncrease the stability and availability of intracellular ssDNAs, \nr etron expr ession systems (r eplicons, promoters and RBSs), \ndonor design (donor length and mutation positions) and \nediting conditions (Table 1 ), we achieved ∼100% genome \nediting efficiency for substitution, deletion and insertion. \nWhen compared with the recently published RLR, where \nCspRecT was used instead of bet to bind ssDNAs ( 31 ), the \nexpression of CspRecT in E. coli resulted in cytotoxicity \nand cell growth retardation (Supplementary Figures S7A \nand S7B). Moreover, by using different promoters and ter- \nminators (i.e. FAB45-L2U5H11 and FAB46-T7terminator) \nfor the expression of retron cassettes, we were able to si- \nm ultaneousl y m utate up to four genes with an efficiency \nof 25 ± 14%, r epr esenting the highest number genes to be \nprecisely substituted in a single round of genome editing in \nE. coli .

Thanks to the high efficiency \nof REGES after optimization, we also achie v ed successful \ngenome editing in WT genomic background, although with \nlower efficiency (Supplementary Figure S7C), indicating the \npotential of REGES for the construction of stable microbial \ncell factories for industrial applications. Ne v ertheless, con- \nsidering the stability as well as the challenges in the assem- \nb ly of repetiti v e DNA sequences, genome editing of more \nthan fiv e genes has not been a ttempted in the present stud y. \nIn our future studies, machine learning can be employed \nto rationally design functional and highly nonrepetiti v e se- \nquences, such as ELSA ( 32 ), ena bling sta b le co-e xpression \nof many retron cassettes and simultaneous editing of more \ngenomic loci. \nBesides multiplex genome editing, we also demonstrate \nthe use of REGES for continuous in vivo evolution of spe- \ncific genes. While se v er al methods for continuous in vi vo \ne volution hav e been estab lished, only a fe w can e volv e the \ntarget protein specifically in E. coli . T7 RNAP guided base \nediting ( 59 , 60 ) have been recently demonstrated to enable \nin vi vo r andom mutagenesis and one of the most powerful \ntools for continuous protein evolution. With the introduc- \ntion of base editing mutations during T7RNAP transcrip- \ntion, the mutation region is started from T7 promoter and \nended at T7 terminator. While gene-specific in vivo evolu- \ntion can be achie v ed, the insertion of T7 promoter is ex- \npected to affect the expression level of the target gene. In \nother words, these systems are more suitable for the evolu- \ntion of exogenous genes and have limited ability to evolve \nthe endogenous genes. On the contrary, REGES-mediated \nevolution system employed epT7RNAP-PmCDA1 to dri v e \nthe expression of retron cassette and random mutations in- \ntroduced to the DN A and RN A templates were incorpo- \nrated into the genome for protein evolution applications. \nIn other words, no pre-editing of the target gene is needed, \nand its expression profile remains unchanged. Another ad- \nvantage of the REGES-mediated evolution system is the \nflexibility in choosing the mutation region. As the insertion \nof T7 promoter and T7 terminator will disrupt the coding \nsequences, they are generally inserted in the upstream or \ndownstream of the target gene, limiting the mutation region \nto the entire gene. On the other hand, the evolution region \nof REGES is determined by the in vivo generated ssDNA \ndonor and in theory any selected region can be e volv ed \n(such as a specific domain or defined region within a cod- \ning sequences). Considering that the editing efficiency will \nbe affected when the donor size exceeds 300 bp, REGES \nis more suitable for continuous in vivo evolution of spe- \ncific structural domains or small proteins. The combination \nof random mutagenesis during replication (Mutator-DNA) \nand transcription (Mutator-RNA) stages for the generation \nof ssDNAs in vivo resulted in a mutation frequency of up \nto 2.4 ± 0.076 × 10 −3 , which is ∼1000-fold higher than \nthe control strain. Theoretically, we can also incorporate \nmuta tions a t the re v erse transcription stage, by the intro- \nduction or engineering of an err or-pr one re v erse transcrip- \ntase ( 68 , 69 ). In this case, we can further improve REGES- \nmedia ted muta tion ra te for continuous in vivo protein evo- \nlution applications. \nIn summary, we established REGES for multiplex \ngenome editing and continuous in vivo protein evolution. \nSystema tic optimiza tion of REGES parameters resulted in \nthe editing of one, two, three and four genomic loci with ef- \nficiencies of ∼100%, 85 ± 3%, 69 ± 14% and 25 ± 14%, \nrespecti v ely. In addition, REGES enab led the generation \nof pooled and barcoded variant libraries with degenerate \nRBS sequences to fine-tune the expression level of endoge- \nnous and exogenous genes. Finally, we employed REGES \nfor gene-specific continuous in vivo evolution, by combining \nwith T7RNAP-mediated base editing and err or-pr one tran- \nscription. REGES can be employed for rapid construction \nof microbial cell factories as well as other synthetic biology \napplications. \nDA T A A V AILABILITY \nThe authors declare that all data supporting the findings of \nthis study are available in the manuscript and supporting \ninformation. \nSUPPLEMENT ARY DA T A \nSupplementary Data are available at NAR Online. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors thank Prof. Seokhee Kim from Seoul National \nUni v ersity for kindly sharing pHyo094 (eMutaT7, Addgene \nplasmid # 173124). \nAuthor contributions : W.L. performed all the experiments \nand analyzed the data.

These \nsystems include well-studied phenomena such as restriction endonucleases and \nCRISPR, while emerging studies have identified many new anti-phage defense \nsystems whose mechanisms are unknown or poorly understood. Some of these \nsystems involve overcoming lysogenization defect (OLD) nucleases, a family of \nproteins comprising an ABC ATPase domain linked to a Toprim nuclease domain. \nDespite being discovered over 50  years ago, OLD nuclease function remained \nmysterious until recent biochemical, structural, and bioinformatic studies revealed \nthat OLD nucleases protect bacteria by functioning in diverse anti-phage defense \nsystems including the Gabija system and retrons. In this review we will highlight \nrecent discoveries in OLD protein function and their involvement in multiple \ndiscrete anti-phage defense systems.\nKEYWORDS\nOLD nuclease, overcoming lysogenization defect, Gabija, retrons, Toprim, ABC ATPase, \nanti-phage defense, abortive infection\n1. Introduction\nBacteria are under constant threat from viruses termed bacteriophages, or phages. It is \nestimated that there are 1031 phage particles in nature (Hendrix et al., 1999; Mushegian, 2020), \nmaking them the most abundant biological agent on the planet. To protect themselves from this \nubiquitous threat, bacteria have evolved numerous systems to ward off phage infections \n(Hampton et al., 2020; Georjon and Bernheim, 2023). A recurring theme in many of these \ndefense systems is the targeted cleavage of phage nucleic acid. The restriction-modification \n(R-M) system constitutes a classic example (Loenen et al., 2014), while more recently CRISPR \nsequences were discovered to generate immunological memory of previous infections and \nultimately generate acquired defense (Mojica et al., 2005; Barrangou et al., 2007). Similar to how \nthe R-M system once ushered in the modern era of recombinant DNA technology, the CRISPR/\nCas9 system has likewise revolutionized biological and industrial research.\nThe impact of R-M and CRISPR/Cas9 systems demonstrates the fruitfulness of basic \nbiological research into anti-phage defense mechanisms, and recent years have witnessed the \ndiscovery of myriad anti-phage defense systems, many of which remain relatively \nuncharacterized. Some anti-phage defense systems feature the activity of prokaryotic Argonaute \nproteins that employ DNA endonuclease activity as the driving mechanism of anti-phage \ndefense (Swarts et al., 2014; Kuzmenko et al., 2020). Others, like BREX (bacteriophage exclusion; \nGoldfarb et al., 2015), involve methylation to distinguish self from non-self DNA but do not rely \non nucleolytic degradation to achieve cell defense (Gordeeva et al., 2019). Other systems do not \nachieve defense through the preservation of the cell but rather through abortive infection, in \nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nAlicja Wegrzyn,  \nPolish Academy of Sciences, Poland\nREVIEWED BY\nPeter Weigele,  \nNew England Biolabs, United States  \nKamil Steczkiewicz,  \nPolish Academy of Sciences, Poland\n*CORRESPONDENCE\nBryan H.

Systems resulting in abortive \ninfection include CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage \nsignaling system) and PYCSAR (pyrimidine cyclase system for \nantiphage resistance) systems, which use cyclic dinucleotides as \nsignaling molecules (Cohen et al., 2019; Tal et al., 2021). Systematic \nsurveys of genomes, in particular focusing on genomic defense \nislands, continue to uncover new defense systems (Doron et al., 2018; \nGao et al., 2020; Millman et al., 2022), most of which remain poorly \nunderstood. A close look at several systems, including the Gabija \nsystem (Doron et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2021) and retrons (Millman \net  al., 2020 ), illuminate a recurring appearance of overcoming \nlysogenization defect (OLD) family nucleases. A classification scheme \nhas been proposed in which OLD proteins can be assigned to different \nclasses depending on their surrounding genetic context (Dot et al., \n2023). In this review we will focus on the composition, structure, and \nfunction of Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 OLD nucleases across diverse \nanti-phage defense systems.\n2. Class 1 OLD proteins: phage-phage \ninterference and structure overview\nAlthough defense islands have been increasingly observed to \nharbor anti-phage defense systems (Makarova et al., 2011), Class 1 \nOLD systems belie this trend as they are instead composed of single \ngenes not found proximal to other candidate defense genes (Figure 1; \nSchiltz et al., 2019). The archetype for understanding Class 1 OLD \nproteins, and indeed the original discovery and namesake for the \nentire OLD family of proteins, arises from early phage genetics \nexperiments. Gianpiero Sironi showed that P2 phage was unable to \nlysogenize E. coli mutants he named lyd (lysogenization defective), \nand subsequently identified P2 mutants that could lysogenize lyd \nmutants (Sironi, 1969). Sironi named this P2 mutant phenotype old \nfor overcoming lysogenization defect. Subsequent work determined \nthat lambda phage is unable to lysogenize a wild-type P2 prophage but \nthat this phage interference is eliminated by mutations in old (Lindahl \net  al., 1970). Lyd mutants turned out to reside in recB and recC \n(Lindahl et al., 1970) components of the RecBCD helicase-nuclease \ncomplex that plays critical roles both in homologous recombination \nand in defense against phages via double-stranded DNA degradation \n(Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008). Expression of the P2 Old \nprotein is sufficient to kill recBC− cells (Sironi et al., 1971), a phenotype \nthat continues to be used to assess P2 Old function ( Schiltz et al., \n2020). P2 Old’s interference with lambda phage was an early example \nof prophage-encoded anti-phage defense, a phenomenon that is now \nrecognized as widespread (Patel and Maxwell, 2023). Indeed, the P2 \nold locus has been observed to encode other anti-phage systems at this \nposition (Rousset et al., 2022; Vassallo et al., 2022).\nAfter early phage genetics defined the protein name and function \nin P2, studies of OLD nucleases mostly disappeared for many years. \nOne notable exception was the purification and characterization of a \nP2 Old construct fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP; Myung and \nCalendar, 1995). This study established that P2 Old-MBP displayed \n5’to 3′ exonuclease activity on dsDNA. Furthermore, ATP was found \nto enhance but not be required for DNA cleavage, and the ATPase \nactivity was not stimulated by the addition of DNA. Whether these \nactivities were unique to P2 Old or were common to OLD proteins \nwould remain unknown until recently (Table 1). A few years later, \nbioinformatic analysis showed that OLD proteins were composed of \nan N-terminal ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-family ATPase and a \nC-terminal Toprim domain (Figure  2; Aravind et  al., 1998). ABC \nATPases are found in diverse proteins ranging from membrane \ntransporters to nuclear structural maintenance of chromosomes \n(SMC) proteins including condensins and cohesins (Krishnan et al., \n2020). The Toprim domain is a divalent metal-binding domain found \nin topoisomerases, DnaG-type primases, RecR proteins, and OLD \nfamily nucleases (Aravind et al., 1998). Toprim domains possess a \nconserved acidic motif that binds to divalent cations which promote \nphosphoryl transfer reactions (Keck et al., 2000 ; Kato et al., 2003 ; \nSchmidt et al., 2010), suggesting that DNA cleavage by OLD proteins \nmay follow canonical two-metal DNA cleavage mechanisms (Steitz \nand Steitz, 1993).\nDecades would pass until the field of OLD nuclease research was \nreignited recently with detailed studies of OLD nuclease structure and \nfunction, as well as bioinformatic and genetic analyses of their \nfunction in anti-phage defense systems. A critical breakthrough was \nthe first structural determination of a full-length OLD protein, the \nClass 1 OLD in Thermus scotoductus (TsOLD; Figure 2; Schiltz et al., \n2020). The structure revealed the protein to adopt a homodimeric \nstructure in which dimerization was mediated through a dimerization \ndomain inserted into the ABC ATPases. Although the ATPases are \ndocked in a conformation not competent to achieve ATP hydrolysis, \nthe structure confirmed that the ATPase domain has structural \nhomology with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of ATPases. \nFIGURE 1\nGenomic layouts of OLD protein classes. Gene neighborhood \norganizations for Class 1, 2, and 3 OLD proteins are shown, with OLD \nproteins in blue. Class 1 OLD proteins appear as single genes. Class 2 \nOLD proteins are synonymous with GajA, and are found together \nwith GajB (green), which shows homology to UvrD/PcrA/Rep-like \nhelicases. Class 3 OLD proteins are found in retron cassettes and \nhave two possible genomic layouts depending on OLD positioning \nrelative to the reverse transcriptase (RT, orange) and non-coding \nRNA (ncRNA, white). Class 3A OLD proteins are found in type I-B2 \nretrons, while Class 3B OLD proteins are found in type I-B1 retrons.\nAkritidou and Thurtle-Schmidt 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1268820\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\nFurther structural studies will be required to determine whether Class \n1 OLD proteins may exist in higher multimeric complexes or associate \nwith other proteins. Biochemical characterization of TsOLD showed \nthat, like P2 Old, TsOLD displays robust 5’to 3′ exonuclease activity \non linear dsDNA, as well as the ability to linearize circular plasmid \nDNA substrates. However, TsOLD is unlike P2 OLD in that the \naddition of ATP has essentially no effect on DNA cleavage by TsOLD \n(Table 1; Schiltz et al., 2020).\nMutagenesis studies in P2 Old showed that the conserved acidic \nmetal-binding residues of the Toprim domain, as well as the conserved \nWalker A lysine critical for ATP binding, were all required for killing \nrecBC− cells, implicating both the ATPase and Toprim domains as \nessential for at least some in vivo activities ( Schiltz et  al., 2020 ). \nHowever, although the structural determination of TsOLD was a \nwatershed moment propelling OLD protein research forward, the only \nClass 1 OLD protein established to provide defense against a phage \nremains P2 Old’s defense of prophages against lambda. The anti-phage \ndefense functions of OLD proteins are better understood from studies \nof multicomponent systems featuring Class 2 or Class 3 OLD proteins.\n3. Class 2 OLD proteins: the Gabija \nsystem\nRecent discoveries of diverse anti-phage defense systems show \nthat OLD proteins not only function on their own as Class 1 proteins \nbut also are found in multicomponent anti-phage defense systems \nsuch as Class 2 OLDs found in the Gabija system (Doron et al., 2018). \nThe genetic organization of the Gabija system was discovered \nindependently by two groups. In the first instance, as part of a \nsystematic discovery of anti-phage defense systems, the Sorek group \nidentified a system composed of an OLD protein (GajA), and a UvrD/\nPcrA/Rep-like helicase (GajB), a system they would name Gabija after \nthe Lithuanian mythology goddess of fire ( Figure  1; Doron et  al., \n2018). They estimated the Gabija system is present in 8.5% of a set of \n38,167 microbial genomes, while more recent bioinformatic tools \ndesigned to identify anti-phage defense systems place Gabija \nfrequency closer to 15% (Payne et al., 2022; Tesson et al., 2022). The \nsecond Gabija system discovery came from the Chappie group which \nwas studying OLD nucleases and termed them as Class 1 or Class 2 \ndepending on whether they were found alone (Class 1) or in tandem \nwith a UvrD/PcrA/Rep-like helicase (Class 2; Schiltz et al., 2019).\nThe first structural work on Class 2 OLD nucleases was performed \non isolated Toprim domains from Burkholderia pseudomallei  \n(BpOLD) and Xanthomonas campestris p.v. campestris (XccOLD; \nSchiltz et al., 2019). Their Toprim domains contain an extra helical \ndomain insert that differentiates them from Class 1 OLD proteins and \nmakes Class 2 OLD proteins about 50 amino acids longer on average \n(Figure 2). Structural analysis of the BpOLD Toprim domain shows \nits conserved acidic motif binds two Mg 2+ ions and suggests a \ncanonical two-metal mechanism for DNA cleavage. Biochemical \nassays with full-length BpOLD and XccOLD show nonspecific \nendonuclease and exonuclease activity on lambda phage DNA which \nis unaffected by ATP concentration (Table 1). The authors proposed \nthat the BpOLD ATPase domain, which is competent to hydrolyze \nATP (Cheng et al., 2021), plays a regulatory role in the cleavage of \nsubstrates by the Toprim domain (Schiltz et al., 2019).\nThe most studied Gabija system is from Bacillus cereus VD045 and \nis found to offer protection against phages of the Siphoviridae family \nincluding the SP β, Φ105, and rho14, as well as phages from the \nPodoviridae family such as Φ29 (Table 1; Doron et al., 2018). Although \ninitial biochemical characterization described the B. cereus GajA \n(BcGajA) as functionally distinct from OLD nucleases (Cheng et al., \n2021), structural superposition of full-length monomers from \nT. scotoductus OLD and BcGajA reveals an RMSD of 4.4 Å despite a \nsequence identity of only 22.2% (Figure 2; Schiltz et al., 2020; Antine \nTABLE 1 Functional properties of OLD protein classes.\nOLD \nclass\nSurrounding \ngenetic context\nSelect \nexamples\nTargeted \nphages\nStructural \ndata\nDNA cleavage \nactivities\nNucleotide \neffect on DNA \ncleavage\nATP \nhydrolysis \nactivity?\nClass 1 Single genes P2 Old (UniProt: \nP13520)\nLambda None Nonspecific 5′ to 3′ \nexonuclease\nHigher [ATP] causes \nslight increase in \nDNA cleavage\nYe s\nT. scotoductus \nOLD (UniProt: \nE8PLM2)\nUnknown Homodimeric \nassembly (PDB: \n6P74)\nNonspecific 5′ to 3′ \nexonuclease; \nlinearizes circular \nDNA\nNegligible Ye s\nClass 2 \nGabija\nAdjacent to UvrD/\nPcrA/Rep-like helicase\nB. cereus VD045 \nGajA (UniProt: \nJ8H9C1)\nSBSphiC, SPβ, \nΦ105, rho14, \nΦ29\nOctamer with 4:4 \nratio of GajA:GajB \n(PDB: 8SM3)\nSite-specific nicking \nActivity\nHigher [ATP] \nstrongly inhibits \nDNA cleavage\nNo\nB. pseudomallei \nOLD (UniProt: \nA3NFC3)\nUnknown Isolated Toprim \ndomain (PDB: \n6NK8)\nnonspecific 5′ to 3′ \nexonuclease; \nlinearizes circular \nDNA\nNegligible Ye s\nClass 3 \nretrons\nUpstream (3A) or \ndownstream (3B) from \nreverse transcriptase \nand non-coding RNA\nE. coli 200,499 \nRetron-Eco8 \n(UniProt: \nP0DV58)\nT4, T7, SECΦ4, \nSECΦ6, SECΦ18\nNone Unknown Unknown Unknown\nAkritidou and Thurtle-Schmidt 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1268820\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2\nStructural similarity and multimeric assembly of Class 1 and Class 2 OLD proteins. (A) Schematics showing domain organization within Class 1 T. \nscotoductus OLD and Class 2 B. cereus GajA OLD proteins. A dimerization domain (tan) is inserted into each ABC ATPase domain (blue). The larger size \nof BcGajA arises from a helical insert into the Toprim domain (red) that is conserved among Class 2 OLD proteins and makes them larger than Class 1 \nOLD proteins by about 50 amino acids on average. (B) Structural superposition of TsOLD (PDB: 6P74) and BcGajA (PDB: 8SM3) full-length monomers \nshows structural similarity (RMSD  =  4.4  Å) despite only 22.2% sequence identity. (C) TsOLD dimerizes and BcGajA tetramerizes in crystal structures, but \nin neither structure are the ATPases poised for ATP hydrolysis. (D) Two separate GajB dimers (green) bind to a GajA homotetramer to assemble an \noctameric GajAB complex.\nAkritidou and Thurtle-Schmidt 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1268820\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\net al., 2023). On the basis of their structural similarity and their shared \ngenomic proximity to UvrD/PcrA/Rep-like helicases, we suggest that \nall GajA proteins are Class 2 OLD proteins, and vice versa.\nLike all Class 2 OLD proteins, BcGajA comprises an N-terminal \nABC ATPase domain and a C-terminal Toprim domain. BcGajA is \ncurrently the only OLD protein known to cleave DNA with sequence \nspecificity (Table 1), as it nicks DNA at a site found both in lambda and \nT7 phage dsDNA (Cheng et al., 2021). Interestingly, in lambda DNA \nthe two cut sites overlap, resulting in apparent dsDNA cleavage activity. \nIt is worth noting that BcGajA resides in a gram-positive bacteria that \nis not infected by lambda or T7 phages, and thus the significance of \nthis cut site being found in lambda and T7 phage DNA is not clear. \nBcGajA endonuclease activity is robust under low ATP concentrations, \nwhile high nucleotide concentrations inhibit BcGajA DNA binding \nand cleavage (Cheng et al., 2021, 2023). Interestingly, BcGajA is the \nfirst OLD protein shown to lack ATP hydrolysis activity ( Table 1). \nThese results led the authors to propose that the ATPase domains \nregulate the Toprim domain by inhibiting its DNA cleavage activity in \nthe presence of high nucleotide concentrations and that GajA becomes \nactivated upon nucleotide depletion resulting from phage invasion, \nreplication, and transcription. Recent studies have reported nucleotide \ndepletion mechanisms in other anti-phage defense systems (Hsueh \net  al., 2022; Tal et  al., 2022), supporting the idea that nucleotide \ndepletion may be common in abortive infection mechanisms.\nThe second component of the Gabija system, GajB, is predicted to \nbe a UvrD/PcrA/Rep-like helicase (Doron et al., 2018). UvrD helicases \ntranslocate along ssDNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction and couple the binding \nand hydrolysis of one ATP with the unwinding of one base-pair of \nduplex DNA (Matson, 1986; Lee and Y ang, 2006). Recent structural \nand biochemical data have shed light on the function of GajB and its \ninteractions with GajA. Structural studies show that BcGajB binds to a \npre-formed BcGajA tetramer to assemble a 4:4 octameric complex in \nwhich with two sets of GajB dimers flank a centralized GajA tetramer \n(Figure 2; Antine et al., 2023). Although BcGajA purified in the absence \nof BcGajB displays robust endonuclease nicking activity (Cheng et al., \n2021), BcGajB is required for anti-phage defense via an abortive \ninfection mechanism (Doron et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2023). A recent \nstudy shows that BcGajB, surprisingly, does not exhibit any helicase \nactivity but instead functions as a (d)ATP/(d)GTPase (Cheng et al., \n2023). Furthermore, the addition of either ssDNA or dsDNA stimulates \nnucleotide hydrolysis by GajB. The authors propose that BcGajB senses \n3′ termini, possibly originating from BcGajA DNA cleavage, which \nactivates its (d)ATP/(d)GTPase hydrolytic activity, thereby driving \nnucleotide depletion and contributing to cell death (Cheng et al., 2023). \nFurther studies will be required to see whether these results, including \na lack of GajB helicase activity, are generalizable to other Gabija systems.\n4. Class 3 OLD proteins: retron-driven \nanti-phage defense\nRetrons are genetic elements found in bacteria comprising a reverse \ntranscriptase and an adjacent non-coding RNA. Their discovery stems \nfrom a 1984 study identifying a small multi-copy, single-stranded DNA \n(msDNA; Y ee et al., 1984), which subsequent studies determined was \ncomposed of a ssDNA covalently linked to a non-coding RNA used as \na template by the reverse transcriptase (Dhundale et al., 1987; Lampson \net  al., 1989). Retron function remained mysterious until a recent \nbreakthrough study that demonstrated retrons belong to anti-phage \ndefense systems triggering cell death through abortive infection \n(Millman et al., 2020). These defense systems contain three components: \nthe aforementioned reverse transcriptase and non-coding RNA, as well \nas an effector protein (Figure 1). Effector proteins vary tremendously \nand include cold shock proteins, zinc finger nucleases, and proteases. \nOut of 4,802 genomes analyzed, the retron effector protein was an OLD \nnuclease 4% of the time (Millman et al., 2020). OLD nucleases found \nas effector proteins in retron defense systems have been classified as \nClass 3 OLD enzymes, with further subdivision depending on whether \nthe old gene lies upstream (Class 3A) or downstream (Class 3B) of the \nreverse transcriptase (Dot et  al., 2023). Within the retron naming \nsystem, these genomic organizations have been described as type I-B2 \nor type I-B1, respectively (Mestre et al., 2020).\nClass 3 OLD enzymes have not yet been characterized through \nbiochemical and structural means like either Class 1 or Class 2 OLD \nenzymes, but AlphaFold models show that, like their Class I and Class \n2 counterparts, they comprise an N-terminal ABC ATPase and a \nC-terminal Toprim domain. Most of what is known about Class 3 OLD \nproteins arises from genetic studies of anti-phage defense. The best \ncharacterized Class 3 OLD protein belongs to Retron-Eco8, which \nprovides defense against T4, T7, SECΦ4, SECΦ6, and SECΦ18 through \nan abortive infection mechanism ( Table  1; Millman et  al., 2020). \nMutational analysis shows that mutations in the conserved aspartates \nin the YADD motif of the reverse transcriptase, or in the conserved \nguanosine branching point in the non-coding RNA, or in the Walker \nA lysine of the OLD nuclease each eliminate anti-phage defense activity \n(Millman et al., 2020). These data demonstrate that all three retron \ncomponents are necessary for anti-phage defense by Retron-Eco8.\nThe mechanisms by which retrons in general and Class 3 OLD \nenzymes in particular lead to either phage recognition or abortive \ninfection remain elusive. A recent study shows that T7, SEC Φ4, \nSECΦ6, and SECΦ18 phages were all able to escape anti-phage defense \nby Retron-Eco8 through mutations in phage single-stranded binding \n(SSB) protein (Stokar-Avihail et  al., 2023). This study showed that \nexpressing the phage SSB in cells that express Retron-Eco8 was \nsufficient to drive cell toxicity and that mutations in the SSB were \nsufficient to alleviate that toxicity. Furthermore, pull-down experiments \nshowed that wild-type but not mutant phage SSB was pulled down with \nRetron-Eco8 msDNA. While these data demonstrate a direct \nassociation between retron msDNA and phage SSB, they do not \nexplain the role of the Class 3 OLD enzyme, which was already \nestablished to be essential for anti-phage defense (Millman et al., 2020). \nFurther studies of Class 3 OLD enzymes will be required to understand \ntheir role in mediating retron-dependent anti-phage defense.\n5. Future considerations\nThe last several years have seen a marked increase in studies \nexamining the structure, biochemistry, and in vivo function of OLD \nproteins. The results of these studies reveal a complicated landscape \nin which the biochemical properties and functions of OLD proteins \ncan vary from one another and depend heavily on the surrounding \ngenetic, cellular, and chemical context. Many outstanding questions \nin the field remain, and below we highlight just a few of them:\nDo Class 1 OLD proteins provide broad-spectrum anti-phage \ndefense on their own?  The only known example of a Class 1 OLD \nAkritidou and Thurtle-Schmidt 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1268820\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nprotein offering protection against a phage is the idiosyncratic example \nof P2 prophages providing Old-dependent defense only against \nlambda phage. Although the broad-spectrum anti-phage defense by \nClass 2 (Gabija) and Class 3 (retron) OLD proteins has been \ndefinitively established, there remains no known example of a bacterial \nor archaeal Class 1 OLD protein sufficient to drive broad-spectrum \nanti-phage defense. Multicomponent systems like Gabija and retrons \nhave shown that each genetic component is necessary for anti-phage \ndefense, and so it would be valuable to learn of cellular systems where \nan OLD protein alone is sufficient to drive anti-phage defense.\nWhat are the regulatory relationships between OLD ATPases, \nToprim domains, and DNA engagement? It may be that the answer \ndepends on the specific OLD protein in question. For example, ATP \nhas been reported to increase DNA cleavage for P2 Old, have minimal \neffect on DNA cleavage in TsOLD, and strongly inhibit DNA cleavage \nactivity in BcGajA (Table 1). More work will be required to understand \nthe regulatory relationships between the ATPase and Toprim domains. \nMoreover, although structural studies of OLD proteins have been \ncritical breakthroughs, there remains a paucity of structural data of \nOLD proteins bound to DNA. Such studies will be  required to \nunderstand how the protein engages with DNA, the physical basis for \nany sequence- or structural specificity OLD proteins may have, and \nwhat regulatory mechanisms might prevent DNA binding or cleavage \ndepending on the surrounding biochemical context.\nHow do phages escape these defense systems? While bacteria have \nevolved complex mechanisms to impede viral infection, phages \ncontinually develop mechanisms to overcome them (Gao and Feng, \n2023). One such mechanism involves the release of the Gabija anti-\ndefense 1 (Gad1) protein by phage Φ3T to thwart the Gabija system \nof B. cereus VD045 (Yirmiya et al., 2023). To resist anti-phage defense, \nGad1 binds to the GajA dimerization domain of the GajAB complex \nand prevents DNA binding and cleavage (Antine et al., 2023). Similar \nphage proteins called Thoeris anti-defense 1 and 2 (Tad1 and Tad2) \nhave been recently discovered in the Thoeris system, another widely \ndistributed bacterial anti-phage defense system (Leavitt et al., 2022). \nFuture studies will no doubt illuminate other escape mechanisms, the \nunderstanding of which may be  critical for the development of \nsuccessful phage therapy (Kortright et al., 2019).\nHow many classes of OLD proteins exist, and in how many different \nsystems? Class 4 OLD proteins have been proposed to contribute to the \nfunction of the PARIS system (Rousset et al., 2022; Dot et al., 2023). \nUnlike the other three classes, in the PARIS system the ATPase and \nToprim domains are encoded on separate genes (designated ariA and \nariB, respectively; Rousset et al., 2022). However, the authors noted \nthat sometimes AriAB is encoded as a single-gene fusion, in which \ncase it is not clear whether the system comprises a separate OLD class, \nor whether the system operates differently from Class 1 OLD proteins. \nFurther studies will be  required to determine whether the PARIS \nsystem constitutes a separate OLD class. Another recent study noted \nthat a component of the anti-plasmid Wadjet system (Doron et al., \n2018), jetD, has homology with the Toprim domain of OLD nucleases, \nwhile the jetABC components include an ABC ATPase with homology \nto the bacterial condensin complex MukBEF (Deep et al., 2022). These \nstudies suggest we have much to learn about the myriad systems in \nwhich an ABC ATPase and a Toprim domain work in concert in \ndefense systems. Future studies will surely uncover in more detail how \nOLD proteins have been leveraged by organisms to defend themselves.\nAuthor contributions\nKA: Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing.

AbpA and AbpB (AbpAB) defend against \nmany lytic phages harboring double-stranded DNA genomes in Escherichia coli; however, \nhow AbpAB senses phage infection and inhibits its propagation remains unclear. Here, \nwe demonstrated that AbpAB inhibited the growth of the φX174 lytic phage with \nsingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as the lysogenization and induction of the Sakai \nprophage 5 lysogenic phage. The AbpAB defense system limits T4 and φX174 phage \npropagation via Abi. AbpA contains a nuclease domain at its N-terminus, and AbpB has \nan ATP-dependent RNA helicase domain; both domains are required for phage defense. \nThis system is activated by phage Gp32 binding to ssDNA and inhibits E. coli  growth. \nWithout phage infection, DNA replication inhibitors or defects in the DNA repair factors \nRecB and RecC activate this system. Therefore, the E. coli  AbpAB defense system may \nsense DNA-protein complexes, including the phage-encoded ssDNA-binding protein or \nthose formed by interrupting host DNA replication or repair.\nIMPORTANCE Although numerous phage defense systems have recently been \ndiscovered in bacteria, how these systems defend against phage propagation or sense \nphage infections remains unclear. The Escherichia coli  AbpAB defense system targets \nseveral lytic and lysogenic phages harboring DNA genomes. A phage-encoded single-\nstranded DNA-binding protein, Gp32, activates this system similar to other phage \ndefense systems such as Retron-Eco8, Hachiman, ShosTA, Nhi, and Hna. DNA replication \ninhibitors or defects in DNA repair factors activate the AbpAB system, even without \nphage infection. This is one of the few examples of activating phage defense systems \nwithout phage infection or proteins. The AbpAB defense system may be activated by \nsensing specific DNA-protein complexes.\nKEYWORDS bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, phage defense system, AbpA-AbpB\nB\nacteria have developed various defense mechanisms against phages for their \nsurvival and propagation. Bacteria prevent phage adsorption by altering or \nconcealing phage receptors, inhibit phage propagation by cleaving phage nucleic acids \nthrough restriction-modification and the CRISPR-Cas system, or commit suicide before \nphage progeny is produced ( 1, 2). The defense mechanism involving suicide is termed \nabortive infection (Abi). As Abi leads to the premature death of a phage-infected cell \nbefore the phage completes its lifecycle, few phage progenies propagate, protecting \nthe surrounding clonal bacteria from phage infections. Abi can be achieved through \ntoxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems \nNovember/December 2023  Volume 8  Issue 6 10.1128/msphere.00372-23 1\nEditor Michael J.

In TA-mediated Abi, phage infection triggers antitoxin \nloss or liberates toxins from the toxin-antitoxin complexes, resulting in toxin-medi­\nated arrests of bacterial growth by inhibiting essential cellular processes, consequently \ninhibiting phage propagation ( 4, 7). In CBASS-mediated Abi, phage infection activates \na cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase), generating cyclic oligonucleoti­\ndes. These second messengers bind and activate various effector proteins, includ­\ning phospholipase, endonuclease, and peptidase, causing bacterial cell death ( 5, 8). \nRetron-Eco48 and -Se72 are activated by inhibiting bacterial RecBCD after phage \ninfection, causing cell growth arrest via unknown mechanisms (6, 9).\nRecently, phage components that induce Abi by activating defense systems have \nbeen identified. Upon binding of the phage capsid protein Gp57 to CapRel, a member of \nthe toxSAS TA family, the N-terminal toxin of CapRel is released from the C-terminal \nantitoxin, becoming activated ( 7, 10). Similarly, diverse phages evade Pseudomonas \naeruginosa CBASS via mutations in their major capsid protein, suggesting that the \ncapsid protein triggers CBASS activation ( 11). The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding \nprotein (SSB) of the phage, which is critical for DNA replication, activates several defense \nsystems, including the helicase/nuclease Hna proteins from Sinorhizobium meliloti  and \nEscherichia coli , Retron-Eco8 from E. coli , and nuclease-helicase immunity (Nhi) from \nStaphylococcus epidermidis  (9, 12, 13). Furthermore, the components of the phage core \nreplication machinery, such as primase, DNA helicase, and DNA polymerase, activate \nmany antiphage systems, including AbiQ, DarTG, Borvo, Lamassu, ietAS, and AbpAB ( 9). \nAlthough novel phage components that induce Abi have been identified, the molecular \nmechanisms underlying the activation of phage defense systems by these components \nremain unclear.\nThe abpA and abpB genes in the E. coli K-12 genome form an operon, and the coding \nregions of both genes overlap by four nucleotides ( Fig. 1A ). AbpA and AbpB (AbpAB) \ncoexpression suppresses the growth of many lytic phages harboring double-stranded \nDNA (dsDNA) genomes ( 14). AbpA and AbpB physically interact for phage defense. \nAbpAB is activated after the middle stage of infection and inhibits DNA replication in T2, \nT4, and T7 phages. However, the T4 phage can evade the AbpAB defense system through \na mutation in gene 41, which encodes a replicative DNA helicase ( 14, 15). However, the \nfunction of Gp41 in this system, the AbpAB activation mechanism after phage infection, \nand how AbpAB inhibits phage propagation remain unclear.\nIn this study, we aimed to examine the effect of AbpAB on the growth of lytic phages \nharboring ssDNA or RNA as a genome and a lysogenic phage and to identify the AbpA \nand AbpB domains required for phage defense. This study also aimed to determine \nwhether phage DNA replicative components trigger the AbpAB defense system activa­\ntion. Finally, we aimed to identify new conditions under which the AbpAB system is \nactivated without phage infection.\nRESULTS\nAbpAB defends against many phages with DNA genomes\nWe assessed the impact of AbpAB on the growth of lytic phages containing ssDNA or \nRNA, specifically φX174 or Q β phages. Both phages grew in cells harboring the empty \nplasmid pBR322 ( Fig. 1B ). Q β grew normally in cells harboring the pST4-1 plasmid \nexpressing AbpA and AbpB; however, the efficiency of plating (EOP) of φX174 decreased \nto <10−4, indicating that AbpAB inhibits φX174 growth. We also examined whether the \nAbpAB defense system induces Abi. Cells harboring pBR322 or pST4-1 were infected with \nT4 or φX174 phages at a low or high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells harboring \npBR322 grew slowly until approximately 6 h post-T4 infection and underwent cell lysis at \na low MOI, whereas cells harboring pST4-1 exhibited normal growth ( Fig. 1C ). Similar \ngrowth curves after infection at a low MOI were observed for φX174. T4 or φX174 \ninfection at a high MOI caused immediate growth arrest and lysis in cells harboring \npBR322 or pST4-1; however, the collapse of cells harboring pST4-1 after T4 infection \noccurred slightly earlier than the phage-induced lysis in cells harboring pBR322. \nResearch Article mSphere\nNovember/December 2023  Volume 8  Issue 6 10.1128/msphere.00372-23 2\nFIG 1 Escherichia coli  AbpAB defends against many phages with DNA genomes. ( A) Genetic organization of the abpA-abpB locus. The coding regions of \nabpA and abpB overlap by four nucleotides. ( B) Effect of AbpAB expression on phage growth. Bacterial suspensions containing the number of φX174 or Q β \nphage particles indicated on the left were spotted onto plates seeded with the E. coli C or A/ λ strain harboring pBR322 or pST4-1. The plates were incubated \n(Continued on next page)\nResearch Article mSphere\nNovember/December 2023  Volume 8  Issue 6 10.1128/msphere.00372-23 3\nTherefore, AbpAB defends against T4 and likely φX174 via Abi rather than a direct phage \ninterference, such as restriction-modification or CRISPR-Cas (9).\nWe then investigated the effects of AbpAB on lysogenization and induction of \nlysogenic phages. The lambdoid Sp5 (Sakai prophage 5), a prophage of the enterohe­\nmorrhagic E. coli  O157:H7 Sakai strain, can infect non-pathogenic E. coli  K-12 strains \n(16). We first assessed the lysogenization rates of the Sp5 phage in cells expressing \nAbpAB, AbpA, or AbpB ( Fig. 1D). E. coli K-12 TY0807 cells harboring each plasmid were \ninfected with an equal number of Sp5 phages containing a kanamycin (KM)-resistance \ngene. Lysogenizing the Sp5 phage transformed TY0807 cells into KM-resistant cells. \nLysogenization in cells harboring pBR322 was 1.3%, whereas that in cells with pST4-1 \nwas considerably reduced to 0.017%. No reduction in the lysogenization rate in cells \nwith pST4-11 expressing AbpB or pST4-12 expressing AbpA was observed. These results \nindicate that AbpA and AbpB coexpression inhibited Sp5 phage lysogenization.\nWe then examined the effect of AbpAB on Sp5 prophage induction. The Sp5 \nprophage was induced in MG1655-Sp5 (km r) cells harboring pBR322 or pST4-1 using \nmitomycin C (MMC), a DNA-damaging agent that crosslinks two DNA bases and triggers \nprophage induction ( 17). The number of Sp5 phage progeny released from cells was \nthen measured using a plaque-forming assay ( Fig. 1E). Compared to the phage progeny \nfrom cells harboring pBR322, the number of phage progeny from cells harboring pST4-1 \nat 4, 6, and 8 h after MMC addition was reduced to <1% of the control, indicating that \nAbpAB inhibits Sp5 prophage induction. Therefore, AbpAB defends against many lytic \nphages with DNA genomes and lysogenic phages.\nNuclease domain at the AbpA N-terminus is required for phage defense\nAbpA encodes a 538-amino acid (aa)-long protein and contains two predicted Pfam \ndomains—the CD-NTase-associated protein 4 (Cap4) dsDNA endonuclease (PF14130; aa \n5-215) and HamA (PF08878; aa 294–519). Cap4 contains an N-terminal effector domain \nwith dsDNA nuclease activity and a C-terminal SAVED domain to sense secondary \nnucleotide messengers synthesized after phage infection, functioning in the cyclic \noligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) ( 18). The Cap4 endonu­\nclease domain shares structural homology with type II restriction endonucleases. HamA \nis an uncharacterized protein that participates in the Hachiman antiphage system with \nHamB (19, 20). We obtained the AlphaFold2 model of AbpA from the AlphaFold Protein \nStructure Database ( Fig. 2A) and searched for proteins similar to the AbpA model. The \nN-terminal region of AbpA showed high structural similarity to the dsDNA endonuclease \ndomain of Cap4 ( Fig. 2B). Cap4 endonuclease activity requires Asp50, Glu67, and Lys69, \nwhich coordinate with divalent metal ions ( 18). In AbpA, the Asp45, Gln58, and Lys60 \nresidues occupy the equivalent steric position as the three amino acids required for Cap4 \nendonuclease activity ( Fig. 2C). We constructed two plasmids expressing AbpA mutants \nwherein Gln58 or Lys60 was substituted with alanine to clarify whether these amino \nacids are required for the AbpAB defense system. AbpB and AbpA (Q58A) or AbpA (K60A) \ncoexpression allowed normal T4 phage growth ( Fig. 2D), indicating the significance of \nboth amino acids in phage defense. This finding suggests that the DNA endonuclease \nactivity of AbpA is essential in the defense system.\nFIG 1 (Continued)\novernight at 30°C. ( C) Growth of E. coli  cells expressing AbpAB after T4 or φX174 infection. E. coli  K-12 strain TY0807 or C strain cells harboring pBR322 or \npST4-1 were infected with phage T4 (left) or φX174 (right) at an MOI of 0, 0.01, 2, 10, or 20 when the optical density at 660 nm (OD 660) reached approximately \n0.3 (arrow). ( D) Effect of AbpAB expression on Sakai prophage 5 (Sp5) lysogeny. TY0807 cells harboring pBR322, pST4-1, pST4-11, or pST4-12 were infected \nwith Sp5 lysogenic phages containing the KM-resistance gene and Sp5-lysogenized cells were selected on LB-agar plates supplemented with KM.

We obtained the AbpB AlphaFold2 model ( Fig. 3A) and \nidentified several ATP-dependent RNA helicases showing high structural similarity with \nZ-scores > 20. Human RNA helicase Ddp5 (DDX19B) structure ( Fig. 3B ) ( 21) exhibited \nhigh similarity to the middle domain structure of AbpB ( Fig. 3C ). DDX19B belongs to \nthe DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase family, which unwinds RNA duplexes or \ndisplaces bound protein complexes in an ATP-dependent manner ( 22). Lys128, Asp208, \nand Glu209 in AbpB occupy the equivalent steric position to the amino acids (Lys144, \nAsp242, and Glu243) required for ATP binding to DDX19B ( Fig. 3D ). We constructed \nplasmids expressing AbpB mutants wherein these amino acid residues were substituted \nwith alanine. Coexpression of AbpA and each AbpB mutant did not inhibit T4 phage \ngrowth ( Fig. 3E ), confirming that these amino acids are essential for phage defense. \nThese results suggest that the AbpB helicase activity is vital for bacterial defense.\nAbpAB defense system is activated by phage-encoded proteins bound to \nssDNA\nThe T4 phage can evade the AbpAB defense system through a mutation in gene \n41, which encodes a replicative DNA helicase, indicating the need for Gp41 ( 14). We \nconstructed the plasmid pBAD33-Gp41, which contained gene 41 under an arabinose-\ninducible promoter, to investigate whether Gp41 could activate the AbpAB system and \ninduce cell growth arrest. Unexpectedly, cells harboring pST4-1 and pBAD33-gp41 grew \nnormally after L-arabinose (L-ara) addition ( Fig. 4A), indicating that Gp41 is not sufficient \nto activate this system.\nCoexpressing several phage defense systems with phage SSB inhibits bacterial cell \ngrowth ( 9, 12). Therefore, we investigated whether the T4 phage SSB, Gp32, could \ninduce cell growth arrest in the presence of the AbpAB defense system. Whereas Gp32 \nexpression in cells harboring pBR322 had no impact on cell growth, cells harboring \npST4-1 exhibited immediate growth retardation upon Gp32 expression ( Fig. 4B ). We \nexamined the growth of a T4-mutant phage (tsP7) with a missense mutation in gene \n32 to validate this further ( 23). Wild-type phages did not grow on cells carrying pST4-1; \nhowever, tsP7 phages showed growth on these cells comparable to that on cells carrying \npBR322 ( Fig. 4C ). These results indicated that Gp32 activated this system to inhibit \ncell growth. The effect of Gp32 on the AbpAB defense system depended on AbpA \nand AbpB coexpression ( Fig. S1A). Subsequently, we examined whether activating this \nsystem through Gp32 requires the ability of Gp32 to bind ssDNA. Gp32 binds to ssDNA \nthrough its Zn-finger domain, a DNA-binding motif ( 24). The Cys77, Cys87, Cys90, and \nHis64 residues in the Zn-finger are required for ssDNA binding. We constructed a plasmid \nexpressing a Gp32 mutant wherein Cys87 and Cys90 residues were substituted with \nalanines. Coexpressing the Gp32 mutant with AbpAB did not retard cell growth ( Fig. 4B), \nsuggesting that activating this system requires Gp32 binding to ssDNA.\nWe previously investigated phages capable of evading this system and identified \nT4-like phages RB32 and RB69. RB32 and RB69 could grow in cells expressing AbpAB, \nwhereas RB49 could not ( Fig. 4D). However, the plaque sizes of RB32 and RB69 became \nsmaller by expressing AbpAB, indicating that the AbpAB system was slightly active. To \nsupport this, coexpressing Gp32 from RB32 or RB69 with AbpAB induced cell growth \nretardation (Fig. 4E). These results strongly suggest that both phages possess factors that \ninhibit the AbpAB system once it is activated post-infection.\nAbpAB is activated by interrupting host DNA replication or repair without \nphage infection\nWe sought to identify conditions under which the AbpAB defense system becomes \nactive without phage infection.

Conversely, cells with \npST4-1 exhibited substantial growth retardation. The number of colony-forming units \n(CFU) indicated that the viable cell count with pST4-1 was reduced to <1% after 2 and 4 h \nof MMC addition when compared to that before MMC addition ( Fig. 5B). These results \nsuggest that MMC activates the AbpAB defense system and induces cell growth arrest \nand death. Subsequently, we explored whether other DNA replication inhibitors could \nactivate this system. When we added norfloxacin (NFLX), a DNA gyrase inhibitor, or \nbleomycin (BLM), which cleaves DNA, cells with pST4-1 exhibited noticeable growth \nretardation, similar to the effect of MMC treatment ( Fig. 5C). However, when we added \nhydroxyurea, 5-azacytidine, and streptomycin, which inhibit deoxyribonucleotide \nbiosynthesis, cytosine DNA methylation, and translation, respectively, no growth \nretardation occurred ( Fig. S2). These results suggest that the interruption of replication \nthat occurs on host DNA activates the AbpAB defense system.\nDNA replication inhibitors such as MMC and BLM induce SOS responses. ssDNA and \nE. coli  SSB production increases during the SOS response ( 25). Therefore, we examined \nwhether E. coli SSB inhibited the growth of AbpAB-expressing cells, as did T4 Gp32. E. coli \nSSB and AbpAB coexpression did not exhibit growth retardation ( Fig. S1B). In addition, \nwe examined whether RecA and LexA, two vital factors in the SOS response, contribute \nto MMC-induced AbpAB defense system activation. When MMC was added to ∆recA or \n∆lexA cells harboring pBR322, the optical density at 660 nm (OD 660) value corresponding \nto the steady state was lower than that of cells without MMC ( Fig. 5D), possibly because \nthe SOS response or DNA repair mechanisms did not work. The growth of recA or \nlexA-deleted cells with pST4-1 was retarded after MMC addition, suggesting that RecA \nand LexA are not involved in the MMC-induced activation of this system. RecB and \nRecC are proteins in the heterotrimeric helicase/nuclease complex known as RecBCD, \nwhich promotes homologous recombination repair in dsDNA breaks ( 26). ∆recB or ∆recC \ncells harboring pBR322 grew substantially slower than wild-type cells ( Fig. S3), possibly \nowing to their defective DNA repair capacity ( 27). Both deletion cells harboring pST4-1 \nexhibited evident growth retardation after MMC addition ( Fig. 5E), indicating that RecB \nand RecC are not essential in MMC-induced AbpAB defense system activation. However, \n∆recB or ∆recC cells harboring pST4-1 grew considerably slower than did those harboring \npBR322 without MMC ( Fig. 5E ; Fig. S3 ), indicating that AbpAB is partially activated by \nrecB or recC deletion, resulting in inhibiting cell growth. These findings suggest that the \nAbpAB defense system can be triggered by interrupting host DNA replication or repair \nwithout phage infection.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study investigated the activation of the AbpAB defense system and its role in \ninhibiting phage propagation. The SSB Gp32 of the T4, RB32, and RB69 phages activates \nAbpAB to inhibit cell growth, thereby inducing Abi. Retron-Eco8 is activated by the T7 \nSSB or SECphi4 phages and induces cell growth inhibition ( 9). Similarly, coexpressing \nthe Hachiman defense system with phage SSBs inhibits cell growth ( 9).

Therefore, phage SSBs are vital \nactivators of many phage defense systems. Binding T4 Gp32 to ssDNA is required for the \nAbpAB defense system, indicating the importance of ssDNA as well as Gp32 in activating \nthis system. In AbpAB-expressing cells, T4 early and middle proteins were synthesized \nnormally, whereas late proteins were hardly synthesized ( 14). This result indicates that \nthe AbpAB defense system is activated after the middle stage of T4 infection, as \nevidenced by the increase in ssDNA and Gp32 levels at the middle stage when DNA \nreplication occurs. However, how Gp32 and ssDNA activate this system remains unclear. \nGp32 primarily binds to the ssDNA produced during phage DNA replication; therefore, \nthe DNA replicative protein complex containing Gp32 and possibly Gp41 could activate \nthe AbpAB defense system. A proposed model suggests that Nhi is activated by the DNA \nreplicative protein complex, including phage SSB, causing phage DNA degradation ( 13). \nSimilarly, Hachiman and ShosTA may respond to a protein-DNA complex formed as an \nintermediate during phage DNA replication or recombination (9).\nAlthough a missense mutation in gene 41 allowed T4 phages to evade the AbpAB \ndefense system ( 14), Gp41 expression alone did not inhibit AbpAB-expressing cell \ngrowth, suggesting that Gp41 may activate this system through Gp32 in T4-infected \ncells. As a mutation in gene 41 encoding a DNA helicase inhibits DNA unwinding, the \namount of ssDNA should be decreased. This decrease could reduce the ssDNA-Gp32 \ncomplex levels, possibly preventing activating this system. T4 Gp32 shares a high \nhomology of 98% with Gp32 from RB32 and 90% with Gp32 from RB69. The conserved \nCys87 and Cys90 residues in a Zn-finger motif among these three phages indicate that \nGp32 from RB32 or RB69 is possibly capable of binding to ssDNA and activating the \nAbpAB defense system. Notably, even though these Gp32 inhibited the growth of cells \nexpressing AbpAB, RB32 and RB69 phages escaped this system and grew. Therefore, both \nphages must be equipped with factors that inhibit the AbpAB system. Identifying and \ncharacterizing these inhibitory factors can provide insight into regulating the AbpAB \ndefense system between bacteria and phages.\nWe demonstrated that interrupting host DNA replication or repair activated the \nAbpAB system without phage infection. This is one of the few examples of phage \ndefense system activation without phage infection or phage-related proteins. A similar \nconcept was recently shown in CBASS, seemingly activated following anti-folate \nantibiotic treatment ( 28, 29). As MMC, BLM, and NFLX act directly on the host DNA, \nAbpAB possibly senses the DNA-protein complexes formed through interrupted host \nDNA replication. The SOS response factors (RecA and LexA), E. coli SSB, and DNA repair \nfactors (RecB and RecC) were not involved in the MMC-induced AbpAB defense system \nactivation. However, AbpAB seems to be partially activated by recB or recC deletion. The \nDNA-protein intermediate complexes formed during DNA repair accumulate in these \nrepair-deficient mutants. Hence, AbpAB may be activated by sensing the presence or \nincreased levels of these intermediate DNA-protein complexes.\nThe AbpAB system prevented the propagation of the φX174 phage with ssDNA \ngenomes. This phage encodes 11 genes, 4 of which (A, A*, C, and J) encode proteins \ninvolved in DNA replication or binding. Proteins C and J expressed from the plasmid did \nnot trigger AbpAB-mediated cell growth inhibition (S. Takita and Y. Otsuka, unpublished \ndata). We have also investigated the ability of the A and A* proteins to activate the \nAbpAB system. As the Q β RNA phage encodes only four proteins, which are unlikely \nto bind to ssDNA or directly inhibit host DNA replication, AbpAB showed no defense \nactivity against the Q β phage. Additionally, AbpAB inhibited the lysogenization and \ninduction of the Sp5 phage; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain \nunclear. In the induction experiment, MMC was used as a DNA-damaging agent. MMC \nmight have activated the AbpAB defense system and inhibited cell growth and viability, \ncausing a decrease in the induced phage progenies. Another possibility is that an \nuncharacterized Sp5 SSB may activate this system. In the context of AbpAB-mediated \ninhibition of Sp5 lysogenization, cell suicide following infection may result in a lower \nResearch Article mSphere\nNovember/December 2023  Volume 8  Issue 6 10.1128/msphere.00372-23 11\nlysogeny rate. We examined the lytic propagation of Sp5 phages to verify this hypothesis. \nHowever, no significant EOP reduction by AbpAB expression was observed (Fig. S4), likely \ndismissing the abovementioned hypothesis. During lysogenization, the host genome is \ncleaved, and an integrase inserts the phage genome. The AbpAB defense system may \nthen be activated, inhibiting cell growth and viability and decreasing the lysogenization \nrate.\nWe identified specific domains in AbpA and AbpB required for phage defense; \nhowever, the biochemical activities of both proteins remain unestablished. The N-\nterminal region of AbpA exhibits a high structural similarity to the dsDNA endo­\nnuclease domain of Cap4. As mutational analysis suggests the essentiality of DNA \nnuclease activity, AbpA could inhibit cell growth by cleaving host DNA. Similarly, many \nATP-dependent RNA helicases exhibited high structural similarity to the AbpB model \nstructure. Amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding site abolished AbpAB defense \nactivity, suggesting that the AbpAB defense system requires AbpB helicase activity. While \nhelicases are involved in many defense systems, such as Hachiman, Hna, and Nhi, how \nthey function in the defense systems and whether they target RNA or DNA molecules \nremain unclear. Several studies have suggested a potential relationship between the \nAbpAB and the Hachiman defense system: AbpA contains the HamA domain (previously \nknown as DUF1837), and phage-encoded SSB can activate the AbpAB system, similar to \nrecent findings for Hachiman ( 9). However, DELTA-BLAST (BLASTp) and Clustal Omega \nanalyses demonstrated that the alignments between AbpA and HamA, or AbpB and \nHamB, were possible only in very limited regions, with the proteins sharing an identity \nof approximately 16%. Additionally, AbpA possesses the Cap4 nuclease domain required \nfor antiphage function, whereas HamA does not. Therefore, we speculate that the AbpAB \nsystem is not a direct equivalent of the Hachiman system.\nNumerous recently discovered phage defense systems have shown a considerably \nlarger variety and number of defense systems than initially expected. Although most \ndefense factors inhibit phage propagation when expressed in multi-copy plasmids, few \nstudies have been conducted to determine whether defense factors expressed from the \ngenome exhibit defense effects. When AbpAB was expressed from a plasmid, the EOP \nof the T4 phage was decreased to 10 −4. However, in wild-type and abpAB-deleted cells, \nthe EOP was comparable, even though AbpAB expressed from the genome reduced the \nburst size by approximately 10% ( 14). Therefore, examining the protective potential of \nvarious defense factors expressed from the genome against phages is crucial. As each \ndefense system alone may not inhibit phage propagation, bacteria may have evolved \nvarious defense systems.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nE. coli strains and phages\nAll E. coli  strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Cell cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for \n3 min, and the supernatant was used for a plaque-forming assay. The phage solution was \nmixed with MG1655 as an indicator cell in soft agar containing LB medium, 0.3% agar, \n1.5 µg/mL MMC, and 10 mM CaCl 2. The mixture was poured onto LB-agar plates and \nincubated at 37°C overnight before counting the plaque-forming units.\nSp5 phage lysogeny\nMG1655-Sp5 (km r) cells were grown in an LB medium supplemented with KM at 37°C \nuntil the OD 660 reached approximately 0.4 and treated with 1.0 µg/mL MMC for 8 h. \nCell cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was used as \nthe Sp5 lysate. A 100 µL aliquot of the Sp5 lysate was mixed with 1 mL TY0807 cells \n(3–5 × 108 cells) harboring pBR322, pST4-1, pST4-11, or pST4-12 and incubated for 1 h \nat 30°C. The mixture was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, plated onto LB-agar \nplates supplemented with or without KM, and incubated at 37°C overnight. Colonies \nwere counted, and the lysogeny rate was calculated by dividing the number of colonies \nyielded on LB plates containing KM by that yielded on LB plates without KM.\nAbpA and AbpB structure prediction and alignment\nThree-dimensional AbpA (UniProt ID: P52127) and AbpB (UniProt ID: P52126) model \nstructures were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( https://\nalphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) (36, 37). AbpA and AbpB structural homologs were searched on the \nDali server using the AbpA and AbpB models as queries ( http://ekhidna2.biocenter.hel­\nsinki.fi/dali/) (38). Superimposing the AbpA model to Cap4 (PDB ID: 6WAN [ 18]) and the \nAbpB model to human RNA helicase Ddp5 (PB ID: 3FHT [ 21]) was performed using the \nSUPERPOSE program ( 39).

This review provides an overview\nof the current state of engineered cellular memory systems, highlighting their design principles,\nadvantages, and limitations. We examine various technologies, including CRISPR-Cas systems,\nrecombinases, retrons, and DNA methylation, that enable these recording systems. Additionally, we\ndiscuss potential strategies for improving recording accuracy, scalability, and durability to address\ncurrent limitations in the field. This emerging modality of biological measurement will be key to\ngaining novel insights into diverse biological processes and fostering the development of various\nbiotechnological applications, from environmental sensing to disease monitoring and beyond.\nKeywords: DNA-based data storage; molecular recording; cellular memory; synthetic biology\n1. Introduction\nBiological processes are inherently complex and dynamic. Living organisms interact\nwith each other and their environments by generating diverse biomolecules and metabolites,\nand these interactions continuously change over time. For example, microbial cells in the\ngut microbiome constantly sense environmental changes and respond by regulating the\nexpression of specific genes necessary for their survival [1]. In multicellular organisms, the\nintricate regulation of numerous genes controls the differentiation of multiple cell types\nthroughout development [2]. However, many of these dynamics remain poorly understood\nsince native biological environments are often inaccessible, and tracking multiple biological\nevents over time is still challenging [3].\nWhile several approaches such as temporal RNA-seq [4–6] and biosensors [7–9] have\nbeen devised to address these challenges in biological measurement, they are still con-\nstrained by their temporal resolution and the number of channels available for data ac-\nquisition. Utilizing DNA as a data storage medium provides high-capacity storage, high\ndensity, and long-term stability to encode various types of data [10,11]. Advanced next-\ngeneration sequencing (NGS) technologies have facilitated convenient, cost-effective, and\nhigh-throughput decoding of information stored in DNA [12]. Furthermore, the inherent\ncompatibility between DNA data storage and living systems has spurred the development\nof various DNA-based cellular recording techniques, which have the potential to acquire\nmultiple and temporal biological information without disrupting cells (Figure 1a) [ 3].\nMany different applications of DNA-based cellular recording have been demonstrated,\nsuch as diagnosing disease biomarkers [13,14], capturing horizontal gene transfer (HGT)\nInt.

Recombination-Based Cellular Recording\nRecombinases are enzymes that mediate site-specific recombination by catalyzing\nexcision, inversion, and integration of specific target DNA sequences, depending on the\norientation of flanking homologous regions. These site-specific DNA recombinases have\nbeen utilized to construct various genetic circuits for cellular recording, such as permanent\ngenetic memories and reversible genetic switches, which can be analyzed by recombi-\nnation site sequences or reporter gene expression [ 22–27]. For the development of the\nrecombination-based genetic memory system with >1-byte capacity, Yang et al. bioinfor-\nmatically identified orthogonal phage integrases with their cognate recognition (attB-attP)\nsites and constructed a ‘memory array’ by linearly concatenating the recognition sites\nfor each integrase [ 23]. With the orthogonal recombinase–recombination site pairs, the\nrecording of temporally ordered signals could also be demonstrated as ‘recombinase-based\nstate machines’ (RSMs) (Figure 2a) [ 28]. In the RSM concept, sequence states could be\ngenerated on DNA registers (memory arrays) made up of overlapping and orthogonal\nrecombinase recognition sites. Depending on the order of a set of chemical inputs, corre-\nsponding recombination events could result in expected sequence states of the two-input\nfive-state and three-input 16-state registers and cellular behaviors.\nBeyond recording the occurrence (presence or absence) of events, the recombinase-\nbased approach could also encode the duration and intensity of biological events. The\n‘synthetic cellular recorders integrating biological events’ (SCRIBE) system was devel-\noped to record analog information, such as the magnitude and time course of inputs,\nwithin living cell populations by converting transcriptional signals into the production\nof single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), followed by ssDNA-based genome editing [29]. In the\nSCRIBE system, retrons, composed of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) region with multicopy\nsingle-stranded RNA (msr) and multicopy single-stranded DNA (msd), as well as retron\nreverse transcriptase (retron RT) [30], are utilized to produce the ssDNAs [31–33]. And the\nssDNAs write information at specific genomic loci as recombination frequencies within\ncell populations when single-strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) are co-expressed. Recently,\nthe recombination efficiency of ssDNA retrons was improved by knocking out or knock-\ning down cellular ssDNA-specific exonucleases, which affect the intracellular stability of\nssDNA, enabling a broader range of applications for the system [16].\nWhile recombinase-based recording systems have primarily been established within\nmodel bacterial systems, their implementations have been successfully demonstrated in\nnon-model bacteria and even in eukaryotes, including human and plant cells [ 34–36].\nHowever, scalability remains challenging due to the limited number of available orthog-\nonal recombinases. To address this, computational mining of efficient and orthogonal\nrecombinases from microbial genomes could further expand the recombinase toolbox [37].\nAlternatively, exploiting recombinases with orthogonal attachment sites and synthetic\ntranscription factors together could increase memory capacity for each recombinase and\nenable much faster recombination [38].\nInt.

Implementation of Genome Editing for Molecular Recording\nGenome editing involves the precise alteration of genomic sequences in living organ-\nisms by generating targeted insertions, deletions, and substitutions. While various genome-\nediting techniques, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) and transcription activator-like\neffector nuclease (TALEN), have demonstrated potential for effective genome engineer-\ning [39,40], the emergence of CRISPR technology has facilitated programmable genome\nengineering, leading to the development of diverse DNA-based recording systems [41–43].\n3.1. CRISPR-Cas9 Barcoding-Based Lineage Tracing\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system, a prokaryotic adaptive immune system, is composed of the\nCas9 nuclease and single-guide RNA (sgRNA). CRISPR-Cas9 is a robust technology that fa-\ncilitates genome engineering, screening, and transcription regulation by precisely recogniz-\ning and cleaving specific locations and editing target sequences within the genome [44–48].\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease causes DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at specific locations,\nleading to irreversible insertions or deletions during the repair processes. The accumulation\nof these mutations could be utilized as unique barcodes for individual cells or cellular\nevents in DNA-based cellular recording.\nCRISPR-barcoding has been utilized for cellular recording, especially lineage tracing,\nby accumulating mutations such as deletions and insertions during cell division. For\nexample, the ‘genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing’ (GESTALT)\nstrategy demonstrated this potential by applying CRISPR-Cas9 barcodes to fertilized\nzebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs for cumulative lineage barcoding (Figure 2b) [17]. Their lineage-\ninformative barcodes were deciphered through DNA sequencing, allowing for the elu-\ncidation of lineage relationships based on mutation patterns. Similarly, the ‘memory by\nengineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout’ (MEMOIR) system generates an irre-\nversible collapse of a set of barcoded scratchpads by Cas9 targeted to the scratchpads during\ncell proliferation, enabling the recording of gene expression dynamics [49,50]. The states\nof these collapsed scratchpads were identified through multiplex single-molecule RNA\nfluorescence hybridization (smFISH) using sequential barcoding to multiplex different\nmRNAs by sequential hybridization [51].\nTo further improve CRISPR-Cas9 barcoding-based lineage tracing, combining CRISPR-\nCas9 barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for the acquisition of\ncellular transcriptomes and cell-type identification, facilitating robust lineage tracing of\nembryonic development [52–55] and tumor evolution [56]. While CRISPR-Cas9 barcoding\nis an effective method for cellular lineage tracing, the activity of the Cas9 nuclease can\nresult in an off-target effect. Furthermore, scalability is restricted by the number of target\narrays or barcodes, limiting its applications to early developmental processes [17].\n3.2. Applications of Self-Targeting gRNA\nSelf-targeting CRISPR, also known as homing CRISPR, is a modified CRISPR-Cas9\nsystem where the Cas9-gRNA complex directs its activity to the gRNA locus itself [57]. As\nself-targeting guide RNA (stgRNA) or homing guide RNA (hgRNA) contains a protospacer-\nadjacent motif (PAM) directly recognized by the Cas9 nuclease, it provides both guiding\nability and target sites. When the stgRNA barcoding elements detect their target sequences\nto trigger mutations, the diversity of stgRNAs can be generated for barcoding and lineage\ntracing purposes [18]. While canonical CRISPR-Cas9 barcoding approaches capture only\nspecific trajectories or moments due to their dependency on barcode sequences, stgRNA\napproaches establish a more independent barcoding system and produce substantially\ndiverse barcodes.\nThe stgRNA approaches have shown potential for mapping cell development. For\nbarcoding and recording cell lineages in mice, the Mouse for Actively Recording Cells 1\n(MARC1) line carried multiple stgRNAs in its genome sequences and was crossed with\nCas9 knock-in mouse [ 18,58]. In their offspring, the activation of stgRNAs generated\ndiverse mutation patterns, which were passed to daughter cells with additional mutations.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 9233 6 of 17\nThis MARC1 system could construct a stable mouse line for barcoding and minimize\nthe unwanted loss of patterns from large deletions. Additionally, self-targeting CRISPR\napproaches have been utilized to record biological events. For example, the ‘mammalian\nsynthetic cellular recorders integrating biological events’ (mSCRIBE) system accumulates\nmutations in their stgRNA containing PAM sequences by linking the expression of stgRNA\nor Cas9 to specific biological events (Figure 2c) [59]. The frequency of accumulated stgRNA\nmutations within cell populations is correlated with the duration or magnitude of the\nbiological signals. Moreover, beyond the relative duration of signals, the elapsed time of\nbiological signals could also be gauged using stgRNAs that decay the intact target sequence\nfrequency [60]. Most self-targeting CRISPR approaches have provoked deletions for their\nmarking but face the risk of erasing existing records. Instead, terminal deoxynucleotidyl\ntransferase (TdT) has been introduced to add new DNA sequences, thereby avoiding\nprogressive erasure [ 13]. However, the increased lengths of stgRNA mediated by the\ninsertions could also decrease editing efficiencies, limiting the scalability of the systems.\n3.3. Base Editing-Based Cellular Recording\nDeletions or insertions formed through the DSB repair pathway, including non-\nhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) [ 61], may lead to\ncellular toxicity and the risk of overwriting new barcodes in existing recordings. Base\nediting, a CRISPR-based genome editing technique, differs from others by not relying on\nCas9 nuclease, instead employing dead Cas9 (dCas9) or nickase Cas9 (nCas9). Both lose the\nability to cleave double-stranded DNA, reducing cellular toxicity but retaining the ability\nto bind target sequences guided by gRNAs. These modified Cas9 nucleases have been\nfused with base editors such as cytidine deaminase or adenine deaminase to modulate\npoint mutations [62–64].\nCRISPR-based base editing has facilitated the cellular recording of extracellular signals,\nespecially effective for long-term analog recording due to its substantial storage capacity.\nBase editing-based recording has been demonstrated in both bacteria and mammalian cells.\nFor example, in the ‘CRISPR-mediated analog multi-event recording apparatus’ (CAMERA)\nsystem, engineered bacteria demonstrated their recording ability in response to various\nstimuli, such as chemical signals, viral infections, and light exposure, by activating multiple\ngRNAs in response to these stimuli (Figure 2d) [ 65]. Simultaneously, the system was\napplied in mammalian cells, enabling the recording of chemical signals and Wnt signals.\nIn CAMERA, expressed gRNAs direct a base editor composed of dCas9 and cytidine\ndeaminase to targeted DNA sequences, facilitating C·G to T·A mutations. These mutation\nfrequencies within populations indicate the magnitude or duration of specific signals.\nThe sequential and temporal logics of multiple signals could also be constructed by more\ncomplex circuits [66]. In addition, dead Cas12a (dCas12a) has also been fused with a base\neditor for single nucleotide editing [67]. To enhance the efficiency of multiplex modulation,\ndCas12a was engineered through structure-guided protein engineering [ 68]. With an\nadenine base editor, it could effectively record much information in human cells [21]. With\nbase editing-based recording approaches, analog characteristics such as the magnitude and\nduration of exogenous signals were reconstructed by the frequency of specific mutations at\ntarget sites within populations [21,65,66]. However, simultaneously distinguishing both\nremains challenging. Furthermore, most base editing approaches have focused on cellular\nrecording at the population level. To address this, cellular recording at the single-cell level\nhas been demonstrated through long-read sequencing of a ‘canvas’ with multiple target\nsites for base editing [69] or editing endogenous interspersed repeat regions for lineage\ntracing [70]. Additionally, recording multiple endogenous transcripts at the single-cell\nlevel could be performed by sensing transcripts with reprogrammed tracrRNAs (Rptrs)\nto convert the target endogenous mRNAs into gRNAs and mediate base editing to target\nDNA [71].\nBase-editing-based approaches have also adopted other DNA-binding proteins to\nguide the target sequences. For example, the T7 polymerase-driven continuous editing\nInt. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 9233 7 of 17\nsystem demonstrated that transcriptional activities under the T7 promoter can be recorded\nthrough continuous nucleotide substitution mutations by exploiting T7 RNA polymerase\n(T7 RNAP) fused to cytidine deaminase (Figure 2e) [72]. The T7 promoter was integrated\ninto genomic loci of specific genes, allowing the T7 RNAP-cytidine deaminase complex to\nconstitutively access the T7 promoter and its downstream region, facilitating transcription\nand sequence editing. Furthermore, base-editing is not limited to DNA; it also enables tran-\nscriptional and temporal recording in RNA by utilizing RNA-specific adenosine deaminase\nwith an RNA-binding domain [73,74].\n3.4. Prime Editing-Based Recording Methods\nPrime editing is a genome editing technique where target DNA is replaced by new\ngenetic sequences [75,76]. It has the advantage of excluding bystander editing and Cas-\nindependent off-target effects, which are challenges of base editing. The prime editor,\ncomprising nCas9 fused to reverse transcriptase (RT), induces single-stranded breaks (SSBs)\nat specific locations directed by prime editor guide RNA (pegRNA). The pegRNA carries\nan editing sequence adjacent to the binding sequence as a template for reverse transcription.\nSpecific sequences generated by RT are encoded by the prime editor, allowing for precise\nediting, such as DNA substitutions, insertions, and deletions, at targeted sites without\nrequiring DSBs or donor DNA templates\nPrime editing has been employed for robust temporally resolved cellular recording\nby producing sequential arrays with incorporated barcodes in the edited sequences. In-\ndividual pegRNAs with unique barcodes are inserted sequentially into specific genomic\nloci [20,77]. The ‘prime editing cell history recording by ordered insertion’ (peCHYRON)\ninserts 20 bp sequences, consisting of 3 bp signature mutations as the barcode and 17 bp\nconstant propagator sequences adjacent to the PAM site [ 77]. With each cycle of inser-\ntion, the previous binding sequences are inactivated by being moved away from the PAM\nsite. Another prime editing-based approach, DNA Typewriter, accomplished sequential\nrecording by inserting short key sequences and barcodes into a tandem array of monomers\ncontaining the PAM sequence, subsequently shifting the position of the type of guide\nsequence (Figure 2f) [20,78]. Exploiting this sequential barcoding in the array mediated the\nencoding and decoding of short text messages within cell populations, collecting diverse\nencoded single cells. Within single cells, 3 bp barcodes were assigned to characters among\nalphabets, numbers, and symbols, and the barcode position in the tandem array encoded\nthe order in sets of four characters.\nFor further multiplex recording, the ‘enhancer-derived genomic recording of transcrip-\ntional activity in multiplex’ (ENGRAM) integrates multiple signals and enhancer-specific\nbarcodes into pegRNA [79]. This allowed for the scalable insertion of specific barcodes,\ncapturing multiple transcriptional activities simultaneously. Despite their multiplexing and\norder dependency, the low efficiency of prime editing-based recording remains challenging.\nTo improve the efficiency and precision of prime editing, engineered prime editors have\nbeen developed. For example, pegRNAs were modified to include structured 3 ′ motif\nsequences that enhance RNA stability and prevent degradation, thereby increasing prime\nediting efficiencies [80]. Additionally, engineered RT and Cas9 nuclease were developed\nthrough phage-assisted evolution to further enhance prime editing efficiency [81]. These\nadvancements in the prime editing approach can facilitate the incorporation of barcodes\nfor rare events, thereby enhancing the reliability and accuracy of temporal recording.\n4. CRISPR Adaptation for Temporal Recording\nThe CRISPR-Cas system functions as an adaptive immune response in prokaryotes,\nencompassing three main stages: adaptation or acquisition, expression and maturation, and\ninterference. The CRISPR adaptation process involves recognizing foreign DNA sequences\nand integrating them into the CRISPR array to establish a genetic memory of viral infections.\nThese CRISPR arrays consist of a leader sequence, short repeat sequences, and spacers\nderived from foreign DNA. These arrays are transcribed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 9233 8 of 17\nsubsequently processed to facilitate interference activity. The CRISPR integrases and Cas1–\nCas2 complex incorporate DNA sequences, typically ranging from 30 to 40 bp, as new spacer\nsequences into the CRISPR array [82,83]. The new spacer sequences are integrated at the\nleader end of the CRISPR array, positioning the newest spacer ahead of older spacers [84].\nUnidirectional CRISPR adaptation has facilitated the temporal recording of cellular\nevents. Arbitrary DNA sequences of a specific size can be acquired as spacers in the\nCRISPR arrays by expressing CRISPR integrases Cas1 and Cas2 [85,86]. Recently, methods\nfor capturing biological events have been developed by integrating intracellular DNA\nsequences. For example, the ‘temporal recording in arrays by CRISPR expansion’ (TRACE)\nsystem records temporal environmental signals into the CRISPR arrays by utilizing a copy\nnumber-inducible trigger plasmid (pTrig), which contains the phage P1 lytic replication\ninitiation protein coding gene downstream of an inducible promoter (Figure 2g) [87]. In\nresponse to environmental signals, the increase in pTrig copy number led to a higher\nfrequency of trigger DNA acquisition in the CRISPR array compared to reference sequences\nsuch as genomic and plasmid DNA. Furthermore, in the TRACE system, multiplex record-\ning of three environmental signals was demonstrated by using a three-barcoded sensor\npopulation. This further enabled the encoding of arbitrary digital data in the CRISPR array\nby electronic stimulation of the trigger plasmid, maintaining robust long-term records in\nliving cells [19].\nThe complex of RT and Cas1–Cas2 has been employed to record transcriptional\nevents through CRISPR adaptation. The Record-seq strategy showed transcriptome-scale\nmolecular recording by leveraging RT-Cas1 and Cas2 to directly capture transcripts into\nthe CRISPR array (Figure 2h) [ 88]. As the acquisition frequencies of spacers depend on\nthe source RNA abundance, highly expressed genes were captured more frequently in the\nCRISPR arrays. To detect rarely acquired spacers, the ‘selective amplification of expanded\nCRISPR arrays’ (SENECA) method was developed to specifically amplify the acquired\nspacers for deep sequencing [ 89]. Record-seq demonstrated its ability to noninvasively\nassess cellular transcriptional events in the intestines of mice under different dietary or\nenvironmental conditions [14]. More recently, the Retro-Cascorder system utilized retrons,\npreviously mentioned in the SCRIBE system, to reverse transcribe engineered ncRNA\nbarcodes into ssDNA. Then, two generated ssDNA hybridized to form duplex DNA for\nCRISPR acquisition [90,91]. The expression of distinct barcoded ncRNA under different\ninducible promoters enabled CRISPR acquisition of different duplex sequences, mediating\nmultiplex temporal recording.\nCRISPR adaptation-based approaches are powerful for temporal information record-\ning; however, their recording efficiencies and applicable host range remain constrained.\nEnhancing CRISPR adaptation efficiency by utilizing internal nucleases or evolved CRISPR\nintegrases holds promise for expanding the recording capacity and applicability of these\nsystems, making them more versatile and effective across diverse biological contexts. For\nexample, Cas4 nucleases or endonucleases such as DnaQ and ExoT inherently control\nthe size and orientation of integrated spacers via asymmetric trimming [ 92–94]. These\nnucleases coordinate with CRISPR integrases, facilitating efficient CRISPR adaptation. Fur-\nthermore, evolving CRISPR integrases through directed evolution and enriching the mutant\nintegrases by perpetual DNA packaging and transduction (PeDPaT) offer the potential to\nimprove CRISPR-adaptation-based recording [95,96].\n5. Using DNA Methylation for Biological Recording\nDNA methylation is a major epigenetic process characterized by the addition of a\nmethyl group to nucleic acid bases, such as cytosine and adenine, without altering the orig-\ninal sequences. This reversible modification mediates the regulation of gene expression in\ndevelopment and disease [97,98]. DNA methyltransferases also play a role in the prokary-\notic defense system associated with the restriction-modification (RM) system [99,100]. Three\nprevalent methylation patterns, including 5-methylcytosine (5mC), N4-methylcytosine\n(4mC), and N6-methyladenine (6mA), are controlled by their catalytic writer, reader, and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 9233 9 of 17\neraser enzymes. Recent advances in DNA methylome mapping technologies have enabled\nthe analysis of these methylation profiles [101–103].\nSynthetic epigenetic circuits, especially those involving targeted DNA methylation,\nhave regulated specific gene expression levels and durably retained cellular epigenetic\nmemory [104–107]. While CRISPRa and CRISPRi methods transiently manipulate gene\nfunction, targeted DNA methylation can provide long-term regulations. For example,\nan engineered bacterial 6mA regulatory system could be utilized to record biological\nevents and control transcriptional events in mammalian cells, since 6mA modification is\nnot common in eukaryotes [108]. In response to environmental signals, a 6mA writer, a\nfusion of an engineered Dam methylase, and an engineered zinc finger for DNA binding\nmediated targeted methylation at GATC motifs to construct epigenetic memory, recording\nthe presence of environmental signals [109].\nGenome-wide transcriptome recording could also be demonstrated using the DCM-\ntime machine (DCM-TM) system through epigenome editing (Figure 2i) [110]. This system\nanalyzed methylation patterns by methylated DNA sequencing (MeD-seq) based on Lp-\nnPI digestion of DCM methylated position [ 111]. An inducible fusion protein of DCM\nmethyltransferase and the RNA polymerase 2 subunit b labeled methylation patterns on\ntranscribed genes and active enhancers when the gene was transcribed by RNA polymerase.\nThis strategy was utilized to understand the genetic activity and temporal dynamics of\nintestinal stem cells (ISCs) during their differentiation into enterocytes. DNA methylation-\nbased approaches could further increase their utility by using methyltransferase and\ndemethylase for reversible epigenetic modification, as demonstrated in the CRISPRoff and\nCRISPRon systems [112].\nWhile methylation-based recording approaches offer extensive scalability for record-\ning transcriptomes by using the whole genome sequence as a recording site, they still\nhave certain limitations. Notably, methylation-based techniques for recording the temporal\norder of various signals and analog characteristics have not been demonstrated. Addition-\nally, the requirement for specific recognition sites for each methyltransferase may limit\ntheir applications.\n6. Outlook and Discussion\nDNA-based cellular recordings using DNA recombination, CRISPR systems, and DNA\nmethylation have enabled the generation of permanent memories of environmental and\nbiological events in living cells. In this review, we examined various DNA-based cellular\nrecording systems, focusing on their principles, advantages, and limitations (Table 1). Un-\nlike existing reviews on cellular recording [3,113–116], we covered the most recent cellular\nrecording techniques, such as prime editing-based multiplexed temporal recording systems.\nAdditionally, we introduced methylation-based cellular recording strategies alongside the\ncommonly discussed recombinase, CRISPR nuclease, and CRISPR integrase systems.\nMolecular recording of cellular events can be applied to diagnosing cellular states,\ncapturing HGT events, tracking cell lineage, storing digital data in DNA, and developing\ncellular therapeutics. Selecting an appropriate recording system will be necessary for\nspecific applications because each strategy has different advantages and scalability. For\ninstance, the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition strategy possesses a distinctive ability to\nrecord horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across a cell population by directly capturing mobile\nDNA from complex environments [15]. When combined with genetic logic computation or\nsophisticated computational algorithms, DNA-based cellular recording approaches have\nthe potential to mediate the control of cellular functions based on cellular memory [117]\nand to reconstruct cellular lineages [118].\nInt.

J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 9233 12 of 17\nWe anticipate that improving DNA-based cellular recorders by enhancing their sensi-\ntivity, scalability, and durability will be key to utilizing molecular recording across various\napplications. While the sensitivity of most molecular recorders is limited to an hour or\nday scale, it is important to address stimuli that occur on a second or minute scale for\nresponding to instant signals. Developing methods to increase the sensitivity for cellular\nrecording at such high temporal resolution will provide real-time monitoring capabilities,\nwhich are essential for applications such as detecting rapid changes in cellular states or en-\nvironmental conditions. A recent study with minute resolution demonstrated the potential\nfor highly sensitive encoding of environmental signals [119]. Engineered TdT transduced\nthese signals by incorporating specific nucleotides in response to cation concentrations,\nsuch as Co2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, and temperature changes within 1 min in vitro. Similar to\nthis engineered TdT, exploiting highly sensitive enzymes could improve the resolution of\ncellular recording.\nFurthermore, expanding the capability for multiplexing and temporal recording will\nbe necessary as these characteristics tend to be inversely proportional. Encoding temporal\ninformation of two or three environmental signals is relatively straightforward; however,\nmanaging temporal transcriptional recording on a genome-wide scale is still challenging\nand requires significant experimental and computational advancements. Expanded scal-\nability to support long-term genome-wide transcriptional recording with high temporal\nresolution will allow for comprehensive monitoring of complex biological processes and\ninteractions over time. A potential approach to enhance these capabilities is to combine\nthe multiplexed and quantitative recording capacity of ENGRAM with the sequential\nrecording capacity of DNA Typewriter [20,79]. The pegRNAs linked to signal-responsive\ncis-regulatory elements (CREs) that are targeted to a tandem array of partial target sites\ncould potentially mediate unidirectional insertions of barcodes for temporal recording by\nshifting the editable positions.\nFinally, enhancing the durability and robustness of recorded data by minimizing off-\ntarget effects and ensuring long-term stability will provide reliable data for extended studies\nand applications, such as longitudinal tracking of cellular changes. The off-target effects can\noccur not only in approaches using CRISPR-Cas nucleases but also in those using CRISPR\nadaptation machineries [ 120]. To overcome these challenges, better control of CRISPR\noff-target effects and the integration of robust memory maintenance mechanisms will be\nessential. To minimize off-target effects, engineered sgRNAs can increase the specificity\nof CRISPR activity by varying the hairpin structure of sgRNAs [ 121] or by delivering\noff-target-directed short gRNA while maintaining on-target efficiencies [122]. Furthermore,\nengineered enzymes can reduce the risks of off-target effects [123]. We expect this emerging\nDNA-based modality of biological measurement will be key to gaining novel insights into\ndiverse biological processes and fostering the development of various biotechnological\napplications, from environmental sensing to disease monitoring and beyond.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.J. and S.S.Y.; writing, H.J. and S.S.Y.; funding acquisition,\nS.S.Y.

{"text": "Report\nReducing competition betweenmsd and genomic\nDNA improves retron editing efﬁciency\nYuyang Ni 1,2,3, Yifei Wang 1,3,X i n y uS h i1,F a nY u1, Qingmin Ruan1,N aT i a n1,J i nH e 1 &\nXun Wang 1 ✉\nAbstract\nRetrons, found in bacteria and used for defense against phages,\ngenerate a unique molecule known as multicopy single-stranded\nDNA (msDNA). This msDNA mimics Okazaki fragments during\nDNA replication, making it a promising tool for targeted gene\nediting in prokaryotes. However, existing retron systems often\nexhibit suboptimal editing ef ﬁciency. Here, we identify the msd\ngene inEscherichia coli, which encodes the noncoding RNA template\nfor msDNA synthesis and carries the homologous sequence of the\ntarget gene to be edited, as a critical bottleneck. Sequence\nhomology causes the msDNA to bind to the msd gene, thereby\nreducing its efﬁciency in editing the target gene. To address this\nissue, we engineer a retron system that tailors msDNA to the\nleading strand of the plasmid containing the msd gene. This\nstrategy minimizes msd gene editing and reduces competition with\ntarget genes, signi ﬁcantly increasing msDNA availability. Our\noptimized system achieves very high retron editing ef ﬁciency,\nenhancing performance and expanding the potential for in vivo\ntechniques that rely on homologous DNA synthesis.\nKeywords Gene Editing; Retron; DNA Replication;Escherichia coli\nSubject CategoriesBiotechnology & Synthetic Biology; DNA Replication,\nRecombination & Repair; Methods & Resources\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00311-6\nReceived 6 August 2024; Revised 20 October 2024;\nAccepted 25 October 2024\nPublished online: 5 November 2024\nIntroduction\nS i n g l e - s t r a n d e dD N A( s s D N A )h a se m e r g e da sap r o m i s i n gt o o lf o r\ngene editing (van der Oost and Patinios,2023; Wannier et al,2021;\nYu et al,2000). They containﬂanking sequences (homology arms)\nand a central region. Theﬂanking sequences are homologous to the\ntarget region in the genome and are typically 30-100 base pairs\nlong, while the central region contains the desired genetic\nmodiﬁcations, such as nucleotide changes, insertions, or deletions.\nThese modiﬁcations in ssDNA enable desired genome editing in a\nwide variety of bacteria (Murphy,2016;S h a r a ne ta l ,2009;Z h a n g\net al, 2000). The “annealing-integration ” model is widely\nrecognized as a ssDNA-mediated gene editing mechanism. In this\nmodel, ssDNA-binding proteins f acilitate the alignment of the\nssDNA donor with its complementary strand near the replication\nfork, creating a heteroduplex that includes a mutated strand. As\nthis heteroduplex is replicated , both mutated and wild-type\nprogeny are produced (Ellis et al, 2001;H u e ne ta l ,2006;\nThomason et al, 2016). Reports from several labs suggest that\nssDNA editing displays strand preference, whereby ssDNA with the\nsame sequence in the nascent lagging strand (Okazaki fragments)\nproduces a higher editing frequency than the leading strand\n(Costantino and Court, 2003; Ellis et al,2001;L ie ta l ,2003). This\nstrand bias can be explained by the presence of more single-\nstranded regions of DNA during lagging-strand synthesis than\nduring leading-strand synthesis, to which ssDNAs have access (Ellis\net al, 2001;H u e ne ta l ,2006).\nRetrons are unique reverse tra nscription systems found in\nvarious microbial genomes (Gonzalez-Delgado et al,2021;I n o u y e\nand Inouye, 1993; Lampson et al, 2005;M e s t r ee ta l ,2020). One\nexample is the Retron-Eco1 (Ec86) system discovered in Escher-\nichia coli strain BL21. The retron operon consists of three genes:\nmsr/msd (for the noncoding RNA, ncRNA), ret (for the reverse\ntranscriptase, RTase) and ndt (for the ribosyltransferase effector\nprotein) (Lim and Maas, 1989;M e s t r ee ta l ,2020; Millman et al,\n2020). The ncRNA itself has two regions: msr and msd.\nRTase recognizes the structured ncRNA and uses the 2 ’-OH of\nthe conserved guanos ine residue in msr as a primer. It then\nreverse-transcribes the msd sequence, producing a hybrid RNA-\nssDNA molecule called msDNA (Lampson et al, 2005;L i m\nand Maas, 1989). During this process, endogenous RNase\nH1 speciﬁcally digests the msd sequence (Lampson et al, 1989;\nPalka et al, 2022).\nThe discovery that the msDNA from the retron system can be\nused as-synthesized ssDNA in vivo for gene editing has attracted\nwidespread attention. The msd i nt h er e t r o no p e r o ns e r v e sa sa\ntemplate for msDNA production and is also the region where\nexogenous sequences are inserted during gene editing (Farzadfard\net al, 2021; Farzadfard and Lu, 2014; Lear and Shipman, 2023;\nLopez et al, 2022;K a u ra n dP a t i ,2024; Simon et al,2019;S i m o n\net al, 2018;T a n ga n dS t e r n b e r g ,2023). During the editing process,\nmsDNA is integrated into the lagging strand of the DNA replicon\nin the form of Okazaki fragments by the same mechanism as\nssDNA (Ellis et al,2001; Gallagher et al,2014;H u e ne ta l ,2006).\n1National Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, P.R.

The gene editing efﬁciency of theﬁrst-\ngeneration system inE. coli DH5α strain is less than 10−4 after ~30\ngenerations of induction(24 h) (Farzadfard and Lu,2014). The second\ngeneration involved introducing mutations in the 3′-5′ exonuclease\nExoX and the mismatch repair protein MutS intoE. coliTop 10 strains.\nFollowing ~20 generations (16 h) of induction, the retron system’s\nediting efﬁciency improved 100-fold to 6 × 10−2 (Simon et al,2018). In\nthe third generation, Schubert et al (2021)s i g n iﬁcantly improved editing\nefﬁciency to nearly 100% after ~20 generations of induction and batch\ngrowth. This was achieved in the EcNR1 strain by knocking out the\ngenes mutS, recJ (encoding a 5’-3’exonuclease), andsbcB (encoding a 3’-\n5’exonuclease) and replacing the single-stranded annealing protein Beta\nrecombinase with CspRecT, another single-stranded annealing protein.\nOther studies have demonstrated that knocking outrecJ and sbcB in\nDH5α strains, combined with the overexpression of Beta recombinase,\ncan result in editing efﬁciencies nearing 100% in ~20 generations (about\n16 h) (Liu et al,2023) or 60 generations (around two days) (Farzadfard\net al,2021). Additionally, a recent study screened for new retrons and\nidentiﬁed several that outperform Eco1 in efﬁciency (Khan et al,2024).\nThis research highlights signiﬁcant diversity in msDNA production and\nediting rates among retrons. These editors exceed those used in previous\nstudies, achieving precise editing rates of up to 40% in human cells.\nResearchers are also working to modify ncRNAs to improve editing\nefﬁciency. They have explored how donor DNA homology arm length,\nmsDNA secondary structure, and the strength of retron operon\nexpression inﬂuence editing efﬁciency. Their ﬁndings show that\noptimizing these factors and increasing msDNA expression can\nsigniﬁcantly enhance editing efﬁciency (Bhattarai-Kline et al,2022;L i u\net al,2023; Lopez et al,2022; Schubert et al,2021). Interestingly, they\nrevealed a surprising effect of plasmid copy number on editing\nefﬁciency. When msDNA was expressed with different plasmids-p15A\n(5– 10 copies), pBR322 (20– 40 copies), pUC (400– 600 copies), the\nediting efﬁciency varied after 20 generations (16 h) of retron system\ninduction. The highest efﬁciency (29%) was observed with the lowest\ncopy number plasmid (p15A), while it dropped to 13% with pBR322\nand further down to 7% with the high copy number pUC plasmid (Liu\net al, 2023). This suggests that unknown factors, beyond just the\nintensity of msDNA expression, signiﬁcantly impact editing efﬁciency.\nResults and discussion\nConstruction and evaluation of a retron editing system\nWe constructed a retron editing system using a plasmid derived\nfrom the p15A origin of replication. The retron operon, consisting\nof msr, msd,a n dret genes, was placed under a strong constitutive\npromoter (J23119) and co-expressed with the CspRecT protein\ncoding sequence to enhance editing efﬁciency (Schubert et al,2021)\n(Fig. EV1A). The msDNA programmable region was modiﬁed with\n92 bp homologous sequences targeting either strand of lacZ,\ndenoted as PSlacZ-anti and PSlacZ in Fig. EV1A,B, respectively\n(where PS stands for partial sequence). Appendix Figs. S1, S2\nprovide additional details on the speci ﬁc locations of these\nmodiﬁcations. These 92 bp homologous sequences carry mutations\nthat, upon successful editing, alter the codons for tryptophan and\nglutamate at positions 17 and 18 of the LacZ protein, converting\nTGG and GAA to termination codons (TGA and TAA). Colonies\nwith successfully edited lacZ gene will appear white on LB plates\ncontaining IPTG and X-Gal.\nWe evaluated the retron editing system inE. coli strains with\nvarying mismatch repair deﬁciencies (MG1655, ΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ,\nΔmutSrecJsbcB ), each harboring either the p15AlacZ or p15AlacZ-\nanti plasmid. The editing ef ﬁciency was minimal in all strains\nexpressing msDNA-PS lacZ-anti (matching the leading strand).\nConversely, msDNA-PSlacZ (matching the lagging strand) demon-\nstrated increasing editing efﬁciency, reaching nearly 100% in the\nΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ strain (Fig. EV1B). Sanger sequencing\nconﬁrmed successful editing in theΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ strain\n(Fig. EV1C). Our results demonstrate that msDNA efﬁciently edits\nthe target gene only when the homologous sequence matches the\nlagging strand of genomic DNA replication, not the leading strand.\nTo investigate the effect of plasmid copy number on editing\nefﬁciency, we inserted the retron operon encoding msDNA-PSlacZ\ninto two newly constructed plasmids: pSC101 (low copy) and pUC\n(high copy), naming them pSClacZ and pUClacZ, respectively\n(Fig. 1A; Appendix Figs. S3 – S4). The previously constructed\np15AlacZ plasmid (medium copy) was also included for compar-\nison. The ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was transformed with each of the\nabove plasmids, and the editing efﬁciencies were recorded every 2 h\nfrom 2 h to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, each strain exhibits a\ndifferent editing ef\nﬁciency. The editing efﬁciency ofΔmutSrecJsbcB -\np15AlacZ approached 100% after 12 h of incubation. The editing\nefﬁciency ofΔmutSrecJsbcB -pSClacZ continued to increase with the\nextension of incubation time, reaching more than 90% after 24 h.\nHowever, the strain with a high-copy plasmid ( ΔmutSrecJsbcB -\npUClacZ) had the lowest editing ef ﬁciency, with the highest\nefﬁciency not exceeding 20% after 24 h of incubation (Fig.1B). We\nthen quantiﬁed plasmid and msDNA abundance at a stable editing\ntime point. The results showed that plasmid copy numbers\nincreased from pSClacZ (6) to p15AlacZ (50) to pUClacZ (420).\nCorrespondingly, the msDNA copy numbers in these strains were\n3, 155, and 340, respectively (Fig.1C). These ﬁndings suggest that\nalthough msDNA production increases with plasmid copy number,\nit does not directly correlate with editing efﬁciency.\nThe presence of plasmidmsd reduced genomic DNA\nediting efﬁciency\nTo understand the reduced editing ef ﬁciency observed in the\nΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUClacZ strain, we considered the mechanism of the\nretron editing system. We noted that msDNA is synthesized using the\nretron operon as a template. This situation could create potential\ncompetition within the cell, as the synthesized msDNA could target two\nlocations: (1) themsd sequence located in the retron operon on the\nplasmid, which is the template sequence used for msDNA synthesis and\n(2) the genomic DNA, which serves as the target for genome editing.\nTherefore, during the editing process, the plasmid-based templatemsd\nmight compete with the genomic DNA for binding to the msDNA\n(Fig. 2A). If this competition exists, increasing the plasmid copy number\nwould lead to moremsd competing with the genomic target. This would\nreduce the amount of msDNA available for editing the genomic DNA,\nultimately reducing the editing efﬁciency.\nTo demonstrate that additional homologous sequences on the\nplasmid can reduce editing efﬁciency, we inserted another copy of\nthe 92 bplacZ sequence into plasmid p15AlacZ, creating p15AlacZ-\nlacZ (Fig. 2B; Appendix Fig. S5). This sequence is identical to the\nYuyang Ni et al EMBO reports\n© The Author(s) EMBO reports Volume 25 | December 2024 | 5316– 5330 5317\nWT lacZ in the genome but differs by 2 bp from thelacZ sequence\nwithin the retron operon. This introduces another homologous\ntarget (Target 3 in Fig.3B) that can compete with the genomiclacZ\nfor binding to msDNA. We continuously monitored the editing\nefﬁciency and observed that, starting from 12 h, the editing\nefﬁciency of ΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ-lacZ was signiﬁcantly lower\ncompared to ΔmutSrecJsbcB -p15AlacZ (Fig. 2C).

Both plasmids, derived from\npBR and p15A origins, contained the retron operon. We inserted a\n92 bp sequence from the kanamycin resistance gene (kanR)i n t ot h e\nmsd region of each plasmid. These plasmids, named pBR-PkanX\nand p15A-PkanY, share high homology (90 bp) within thekanR\nsequence of theirmsd r e g i o n s ,b u td i f f e rb yo n l yt w os p e c iﬁcb a s e s :\nT-T in pBR-PkanX and G-A in p15A-PkanY (Fig.3A; Appendix\nFigs. S6, S7). We hypothesized that msDNA-kanX generated from\npBR-PkanX would serve as a template to edit themsd region of\np15A-PkanY, speci ﬁcally mutating the G-A sequence to T-T.\nConversely, msDNA-kanY generated from p15A-PkanY would edit\nthe msd region of pBR-PkanX, changing the T-T sequence to G-A\n(Fig. 3B). However, achieving complete editing (100%) of all\nplasmid copies in a bacterial cell is challenging due to the presence\nof multiple plasmid copies. Therefore, we anticipate observing\ndouble peaks during sequencing at the mutation sites within the\nmsd region. This pattern of double peaks would be indicative of\nsuccessful editing within themsd region. One peak would represent\nthe original unedited sequence, while the other peak would\nrepresent the incorporated msDNA sequence containing the two-\nbase difference.\nThe ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was co-transformed with pBR-PkanX\nand p15A-PkanY plasmids.

Only those transformed cells harboring both\nplasmids were able to survive due to antibiotic resistance. We\nampliﬁed themsd regions of the plasmids by PCR from the colonies\nof strain 1, using upstream primers located in the sm\nR and cmR gene\nregions, respectively, along with a downstream primer in the ret\ngene region (see Reagents and tools table). This design ensured that\nonly one plasmid served as the template for PCR ampliﬁcation.\nSequencing of the PCR product revealed a double peak at the 2 bp\nmutation site, indicating that the msd of the plasmid was\nsuccessfully edited by msDNA (Fig.3B).\nTo conﬁrm thatmsd editing originated from the msDNA of the\nother plasmid, we constructed control plasmids lacking a functional\nretron promoter. We deleted the retron promoter in pBR-PkanX\nand p15A-PkanY, resulting in pBR-ØkanX and p15A-ØkanY\nplasmids, respectively (Fig. 3A; Appendix Figs. S8, S9). We\nhypothesized that with an inactive retron operon, msd editing\nwould not occur. The ΔmutSrecJsbcB strain was co-transformed\nwith three different plasmid combinations: pBR-ØkanX with p15A-\nPkanY, pBR-PkanX with p15A-ØkanY, and pBR-ØkanX with\np15A-ØkanY. This process resulted in the generation of three\nseparate strains, designated as strains 2, 3, and 4, respectively\n(Fig. 3C). Subsequently, the msd r e g i o n si na l lt h r e es t r a i n sw e r e\nsequenced to analyze potential editing events.

The above results\ndemonstrate that msDNA synthesized by an active retron operon\ncan edit msd on the plasmid.\nEffects of msd positioning and enhanced retron system\non editing efﬁciency\nBecause the homologous sequence in msDNA has a stronger\nediting ability when it is consistent with the lagging strand\nsequence of the replication fork (Ellis et al,2001; Gallagher et al,\n2014;H u e ne ta l ,2006), we hypothesized that msDNA-PSlacZ\ncould act as both the lagging strand during genomic DNA\nreplication and pUClacZ plasmid replication. This suggests that\nmsDNA-PSlacZ might be intensively used for editing of the pUC\nplasmid’s msd, depleting the pool of msDNA available for editing\nthe genomic lacZ target, and thus reducing its editing efﬁciency\n(Fig. 4A).\nTo address this potential competition, we took advantage of the\nﬁxed replication start site (ori) and termination site (ter)i nt h e\npUC plasmid. We strategically relocated the msd to a different\nposition on the plasmid, across theter boundary. This relocation\nwould alter the role of msDNA-PSlacZ during replication. Instead\nof acting as the lagging strand, msDNA-PSlacZ would act as the\nleading strand, preventing it from editing themsd once it moves\nacross the ter boundary. The pUC plasmid, which replicates via the\nColE1-based ori in a theta (θ) fashion (Lilly and Camps,2015), has\nan unclear exact ter location, though it is believed that ColE1\nplasmids replicate at different rates on either side of theori (Lovett\net al, 1974; Viguera et al, 1996) .B a s e do nt h i su n c e r t a i n t y ,w e\nrelocated themsd position on the plasmid clockwise by 991 bp from\nits original position while keeping the plasmid size unchanged,\nresulting in the creation of the pUClacZ1 plasmid (Fig. 4B;\nAppendix Fig. S10). Compared to ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ, the\nediting efﬁciency of ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ1 increased from 5%\nat 2 h to ~70% after 24 h (Fig.4C), demonstrating the efﬁcacy of\nmsd relocation for enhanced editing efﬁciency.\nTo further increase this efﬁciency, we repositioned the msd an\nadditional 827 bp clockwise, creating the pUClacZ2 plasmid\n(Fig. 4D; Appendix Fig. S11). This adjustment signi ﬁcantly\nenhanced genomic lacZ\nediting ef ﬁciency, with the ΔmutS-\nrecJsbcB-pUClacZ2 achieving over 80% editing within just 2 h\nand nearly 100% after 6 h (Fig.4E). But, after 18 h, the efﬁciency\ntemporarily dropped to 70% before recovering to nearly 100% by\n22 h (Fig.4E). The substantial increase in editing efﬁciency in the\nΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ2 strain suggests that theter site lies within\nthe 827 bp range and that this repositioning shifted the msDNA-\nPSlacZ from the lagging to the leading strand. This reducedmsd\nediting on the plasmid while enhancing genomiclacZ editing. In\naddition, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in the growth rate of\nthe ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ2 strain (Fig. 4E). We hypothesized\nthat this decrease may be due to reduced plasmid stability, leading\nto a signiﬁcant loss of plasmids. This loss could result in a sharp\ndecrease in the number of antibiotic-resistant colonies, contribut-\ning to the observed decrease in growth rate.\nTo address these issues, we constructed the pUClacZ3 plasmid\nby reversing the orientation of theori (Fig. 4F; Appendix Fig. S12).\nGiven the unequal replication rates on either side of the ori, we\nhypothesized that this reversal would shift theter position by 180\ndegrees, transitioning msDNA from the lagging strand to the\nleading strand. As anticipated, ΔmutSrecJsbcB -pUClacZ3 main-\ntained high genomic editing ef ﬁciency and excellent stability\nwithout negatively impacting bacterial growth (Fig. 4G). These\nﬁndings underscore the importance of minimizingmsd editing to\nenhance genomic editing efﬁciency. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat reducing msd editing is a powerful strategy for improving gene\nediting outcomes.\nTo demonstrate the versatility of the improved retron system, we\napplied it to new targets in the E. coli genome. Two genes, ung\n(involved in DNA repair) andbetI (choline metabolism), located on\nopposite sides of the genomicori, were chosen for testing. We replaced\nthe lacZ homologous sequence in pUClacZ3 with the corresponding\nhomologous sequences of ung and betI (Appendix Figs. S13, S14),\nusing retron editing to introduce two-point mutation inung and one\nbase pair deletion inbetI (Fig. EV2A,B). Sequencing results revealed\nsuccessful editing for both genes within 2 h of liquid culture\n(Fig. EV2C). This demonstrates the broad applicability of our system\nfor targeting various genome genes for editing.\nIn this study, we investigated how varying the number of\nmsDNA template sequences (msd) affects genome editing efﬁciency\nin E. coli, a model prokaryotic strain. While increasing the copy\nnumber of msd enhanced msDNA expression, it also led to\nunwanted competition, ulti mately reducing editing ef ﬁciency. In\nconventional ssDNA-mediated gene editing, ssDNA is introduced\ninto the cell via electroporation without requiring intracellular\ntemplate synthesis. In contrast, retron editing synthesizes ssDNA\nwithin the cell using msd as a template. This introduces\ncompetition, which is absent in traditional ssDNA methods.\nDespite increasing interest in retron technology, prior studies have\noverlooked this competition issue. Our study is theﬁrst to identify\nand conﬁrm msd editing by msDNA, and we propose a novel\nmethod to reduce this competition, signiﬁcantly enhancing target\ngene editing efﬁciency.\nRetrons have gained signiﬁcant interest for their potential as\npowerful in vivo DNA writing tools, exempli ﬁed by SCRIBE\nFigure 3. msDNA-mediated editing of msd sequences on plasmids.\n(A) A schematic diagram illustrates four plasmids: pBR-PkanX, p15A-PKanY, pBR-ØkanX, and p15A-ØKanY. Each plasmid contains a 92 bp fragment within its msd region\nhomologous to the kanamycin resistance gene (green line). Notably, these homologous sequences share a high degree of similarity (90 bp), differing by only two speciﬁc\nbase pairs: “T-T” in pBR-PkanX and“G-A” in pBR-PkanY. Green and purple stars indicate mutation sites. Plasmids pBR-PkanX and p15A-PKanY possess theJ23119\npromoter, enabling retron operon transcription and subsequent msDNA expression. In contrast, theJ23119 promoter is absent in pBR-ØkanX and p15A-ØKanY, preventing\nretron operon transcription and msDNA production. The detailed sequences of the plasmids are provided in Appendix Figs. S6–S9. (B) TheΔmutSrecJsbcB strain harboring\ntwo plasmids, pBR-PkanX and p15A-PKanY (strain 1), was constructed.

(C) Schematic diagrams illustrate strains 2, 3, and 4, each carrying different plasmid\ncombinations, as shown in theﬁgure. Sequencing data of the targetedmsd gene regions from these strains reveal mutations introduced through editing, denoted by red\nletters.\nYuyang Ni et al EMBO reports\n© The Author(s) EMBO reports Volume 25 | December 2024 | 5316– 5330 5321\n(Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events)\n(Farzadfard and Lu, 2014;L e a re ta l ,2023). However, a major\nchallenge for SCRIBE is its slow writing speed. Only one in 10,000\nE. coli cells integrates the desired edit per generation (Farzadfard\nand Lu, 2014), and even the improved HiSCRIBE version requires\n~60 generations (2 days) for complete writing (Farzadfard et al,\n2021). This slow writing speed arises from the inefﬁciency of the\nediting process. Because relativelyfew cells successfully incorporate\nthe desired mutation in each generation, many cell divisions are\nrequired before the edited population becomes a signi ﬁcant\nproportion of the overall culture. This limitation hinders SCRIBE’s\nability to record rapid environmental changes. Theoretically, with\nEMBO reports Yuyang Ni et al\n5322 EMBO reports Volume 25 | December 2024 | 5316– 5330 © The Author(s)\n100% efﬁciency of msDNA integration at the replication fork, after\none round of replication, the DNA would form 2 double strands,\nwith no pure mutants yet. Following a second round, there would\nbe 4 double strands and 1 pure mutant. By extension, after six\nrounds, there would be 64 double strands and 57 pure mutants. In\nother words, the theoretical maximum mutation rate after six\nrounds of replication (~6 generations) is approximately 89%. In our\nwork, we were able to achieve over 80% ef ﬁciency in editing\nbacteria within ~6 generations (2 h). It suggests that the method is\napproaching its theoretical limit. This dramatic increase in writing\nspeed paves the way for real-time recording of dynamic environ-\nmental changes using retron systems, opening exciting possibilities\nfor environmental monitoring and synthetic biology applications.\nIn applying these conclusions to plasmids with various\nreplication origins, it’s crucial to note thatmsd-induced competi-\ntion is more signi ﬁcant in high-copy plasmids compared to\nmedium- and low-copy ones. To reduce this competition in high\ncopy number plasmids, we propose two strategies: (1) adjusting the\nrelative position of msd on the plasmid and (2) reversing the\norientation of the plasmid replicon. For plasmids with a theta\nreplication mechanism that repl icates at the same rate in both\ndirections, the ﬁrst strategy is effective, while the second is not.\nHowever, the ﬁrst approach may carry potential risks, such as\naltered msDNA production or re duced plasmid stability. In\ncontrast, both strategies are effective for plasmids that replicate at\ndifferent rates in each direction. In these cases, we prefer the second\nmethod, as it reduces competition while minimizing the impact on\nplasmid stability and preserving the operon’sf u n c t i o n .\nThe successful application of t he retron editing system in\nvarious organisms, including yeast (Gonzalez-Delgado et al,2024;\nSharon et al,2018), mammalian cells (Kong et al,2021; Lopez et al,\n2022;Z h a oe ta l ,2022), and plants (Jiang et al, 2022), has\nhighlighted a potential issue: the competition between msd and\ngenomic DNA targets within eukaryotic cells. Unlike bacteria,\neukaryotes utilize the retron system in conjunction with CRISPR-\nCas9 tools, which create double-strand breaks (DSBs) in genomic\nDNA. Here, msDNA plays a crucial role in repairing DSBs by\nproviding a template for DNA polymerase to ﬁll the gap and\nintegrate the desired edits, a process known as homology-directed\nrepair (HDR) (Sharon et al, 2018;Z h a oe ta l ,2022). To express\nmsDNA in eukaryotic systems, retrons are typically integrated into\nshuttle plasmids, viral vectors, or directly into the host genome,\nr e s u l t i n gi nm u l t i p l eo rs i n g l ec o p i e so fmsd within the cell. Studies\nin yeast have shown that ssDNA can participate in DNA replication\nas the lagging strand during plasmid replication, similar to the\nprocess observed in prokaryotes (Barbieri et al,2017). This suggests\nthat msDNA could potentially target originating plasmids or viral\nvectors and participate in their replication process. Such self-\ntargeting may reduce the pool of msDNA available for effective\nHDR, thereby decreasing the overall ef ﬁciency of the editing\nprocess. Supporting this notion, a study by Zhao et al observed a\ndiscrepancy between msDNA abundance and editing efﬁciency in\ndifferent retron systems. While Retron Sa163 from\nStigmatella\naurantiaca generated the most msDNA, it exhibited a lower HDR\nrate compared to Eco1 (Zhao et al, 2022). Furthermore, certain\nretron editing systems that demonstrate high ef ﬁciency in\nprokaryotes do not yield similar results in eukaryotic cells (Khan\net al,2024; Lopez et al,2022). We believe this difference arises from\nvariations in editing mechanisms. In prokaryotes, msDNA is\nutilized during DNA replication for editing, whereas in eukaryotes,\nit serves as a template for repair during the HDR process following\nDSBs. Therefore, in addition to the competitive mechanisms\nrevealed in this study, we speculate that another signiﬁcant factor\nlimiting the ef ﬁciency of retron editing in eukaryotes is the\ninefﬁciency of HDR.\nMethods\nReagents and tools table\nReagent/resource\nReference or\nsource Identi ﬁer or catalog number\nExperimental models\nE. coli DH5a ThermoFisher 18265017\nE. coli MG1655 WT ATCC 700926\nE. coli ΔmutS This study N/A\nE. coli ΔmutSrecJ This study N/A\nE. coli ΔmutSrecJsbcB This study N/A\nRecombinant DNA\npFF745 Farzadfard\nand Lu, 2014\nAddgene #61450\nFigure 4.

Mini\nKit\nAbclonal RK30101\nPlasmid construction\nWe constructed plasmids using pFF745 as the parent vector\n(Farzadfard and Lu,2014). Primer pairs used for plasmid construction\nwere synthesized from Tianyi Huiyuan (Wuhan, Hubei, China) (see\nReagents and tools table). All plasmids generated in this study were\nassembled using the Hieff Clone Plus multi-one-step cloning kit\n(Yeasen, Shanghai, China) and conﬁrmed by sequencing (Quintarabio,\nWuhan, Hubei, China). The constructed plasmids were transformed\ninto bacterial cells using the calcium chloride (CaCl\n2) method to\ngenerate corresponding derivative strains. Plasmids and their sequence\nare shown in the Appendix.\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nE. coli DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. ΔmutS,\nΔmutSrecJ, and ΔmutSrecJsbcB strains were generated via the\nCRISPR-Cas9 System (Jiang et al,2015). All strains were grown in\nLB medium (containing 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g\nNaCl per liter) at 37 °C supplemented with chloramphenicol\n(15 μg/mL) or spectinomycin (20μg/mL) when necessary.\nEditing efﬁciency quantiﬁcation\nWe used blue-white screening to quantify gene editing efﬁciency.\nApproximately 200 ng of the plasmid of interest was added to 100μL\nof competentΔmutSrecJsbcB cells. The mixture was incubated on ice\nfor 30 min, followed by a heat shock at 42 °C for 90 s. Afterward, the\ncells were placed on ice for an additional 2 min. To promote cell\nrecovery, 900μL of pre-warmed LB medium was added, and the\nsuspension was incubated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) for one\nhour. Following recovery, 1 mL of culture was transferred to fresh LB\nmedium (50 mL) containing chloramphenicol (50μg/mL) and incu-\nbated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) until reaching the desired time\npoint. The culture was then diluted and plated onto LB agar containing\nIPTG, X-gal, and chloramphenicol. After overnight incubation at\n37 °C, white and blue colonies were counted, and editing efﬁciency was\ncalculated as the percentage of white colonies relative to the total\nnumber of colonies.\nWe categorized the bacteria into three groups based on their\nediting status: Group 1 consists of fully edited bacteria, which are\ncompletely edited in the liquid medium, resulting in colonies that\ncontain 100% non-functional lacZ and appear as white colonies.\nGroup 2 includes partially editedbacteria that are unedited in the\nliquid medium but undergo editing while grown on a solid\nmedium, causing these colonies to exhibit a slight blue color due to\nthe presence of unedited bacter ia. Group 3 comprises unedited\nbacteria, which retain functionallacZ and thus form blue colonies\ndue to X-gal hydrolysis. In our analysis, we recognized only theﬁrst\ngroup of bacteria as edited.\nDetermination of plasmid and msDNA copy numbers\nTo estimate plasmid and msDNA copy numbers, we employed\nReal-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) following a cell lysis step.\nBrieﬂy, 100 μL of logarithmically growing cells were lysed by\nboiling for 10 min. Lysates containing genomic DNA, plasmid\nDNA, and msDNA were stored at −20 °C until further analysis\n(Lopez et al,2022).\nThree sets of primers were used for qRT-PCR: (1) tdk-qPCR\nprimers: These primers (tdk-qPCR-F and tdk-qPCR-R) amplify\ngenomic DNA and generate a cycle threshold (Ct) value called C\ntg.\n(2) ret-qPCR primers: These primers (ret-qPCR-F and ret-qPCR-R)\namplify plasmid DNA, producing a Ct value named Ctp. (3) msd-qPCR\nprimers: This primer set (msd-qPCR-F and msd-qPCR-R) targets the\nmsr/msd region, amplifying the corresponding sequences on msDNA\nand plasmids. This ampliﬁcation generates a Ct value called C\ntm.\nThe plasmid and msDNA copy numbers were estimated using\nqRT-PCR data by comparing the Ct values from genomic, plasmid,\nEMBO reports Yuyang Ni et al\n5326 EMBO reports Volume 25 | December 2024 | 5316– 5330 © The Author(s)\nand msDNA sequences. The formulas used account for the\ndifferences in ampliﬁcation of these DNA types.\nThe plasmid copy number was estimated using the formula:\nplasmid copy number¼ 2/C0 ΔCt ¼ 2ðCtg/C0 CtpÞ\nThis formula estimates how many more plasmid copies exist\nrelative to the genomic DNA.\nThe msDNA copy number was estimated using the following\nformula:\nmsDNA copy number¼ 2ðCtg/C0 CtmÞ /C0 plasmid copy number:\nThis formula ﬁrst estimates the total number of copies\ncontaining the msDNA sequence (which could be present on both\nplasmids and msDNA molecules). By subtracting the plasmid copy\nnumber (which also contains the msr/msd sequence), the msDNA\ncopy number is isolated.\nThe copy numbers are relative estimates, assuming that the\ngenomic DNA region has a copy number of 1. Due to potential\ndifferences in PCR ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies between primers, these\nestimates are not absolute. Variations in ampliﬁcation can affect the\nCt values, so the plasmid and msDNA copy numbers should be\ninterpreted as relative rather than precise measurements.\nqRT-PCR was done on a Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. Each\nreaction included: 10 μLH i e f f® qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix,\n1 μLe a c ho ff o r w a r da n dr e v e r s ep r i m e r s( 0 . 5μM ﬁnal concentra-\ntion), 0.4μL template DNA, nuclease-free water to aﬁnal volume of\n20 μL. Thermal cycling conditions were: pre-denaturation at 95 °C\nfor 4 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s (repeated 40 cycles),\nannealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s (during which\nﬂuorescence was measured). Melting curve analysis was done after\n40 cycles to assess amplicon speciﬁcity. Ampliﬁcation curves and\nmelting curves were generated using CFX Maestro software 2.3\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, TX, USA). For each strain or control\ncondition, three clones were used as biological replicates, with each\nsample run in triplicate wells for technical replication.\nData availability\nThis study includes no data deposited in external repositories.\nThe source data of this paper are collected in the following\ndatabase record: biostudies:S-SCDT-10_1038-S44319-024-00311-6 .\nExpanded view data, supplementary information, appendices are\navailable for this paper athttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00311-6.\nPeer review information\nA peer reviewﬁle is available athttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00311-6\nReferences\nBarbieri EM, Muir P, Akhuetie-Oni BO, Yellman CM, Isaacs FJ (2017) Precise\nediting at DNA replication forks enables multiplex genome engineering in\neukaryotes.

Schematic representation of the retron operon and msDNA-mediated genomiclacZ editing process.\n(A) Top panel: The retron operon is represented by double-stranded DNA labeled as the coding strand and template strand, respectively. A strong constitutive promoter,\nJ23119 (black arrow), drives transcription of the operon, which encodes msDNA (msr/msd), reverse transcriptase (ret), and CspRecT (recT). The coding regions ofmsr and\nmsd are depicted as blue and gray rectangles, respectively. A segment within themsd coding region (gray rectangle), which shares signiﬁcant sequence similarity with the\ngenomic lacZ gene, is denoted as the PSlacZ-anti coding sequence (PS stands for partial sequence). The blue line aligns with thelacZ coding strand, while the red line\nrepresents its reverse complement. The mutation sequence is indicated by a yellow star. Transcription and reverse transcription produce msDNA, a hybrid of msr RNA\n(light blue) and cDNA (black). The msDNA incorporateslacZ homologous sequences, designated PSlacZ-anti (red).E. coligenomic DNA and plasmid are shown as double-\nstranded structures. The genomicori and ter are marked in blue and yellow, respectively. ThelacZ gene and its transcription direction are indicated by a purple arrow.\nDuring E. coligenomic DNA replication, msDNA (red lines) integrates into the single-stranded DNA region at the replication fork through base pairing. Notably, msDNA-\nPSlacZ-anti has the same sequence as the leading strand. The detailed sequence of the plasmid is provided in Appendix Fig. S1. Bottom panel: The retronoperon expresses\nmsDNA-PSlacZ, which incorporateslacZ homologous sequences designated PSlacZ (blue). Importantly, PSlacZ is the reverse complement of PSlacZ-anti. PSlacZ shares\nthe same sequence as the lagging strand. (B) Effect of strain and editing template on genomiclacZ gene editing efﬁciency at 24 h of incubation. We compared the editing\nefﬁciency in WT (no mutation control),ΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ, andΔmutSrecJsbcB strains expressing msDNA-PSlacZ-anti or msDNA-PSlacZ. The data are presented as a bar\ngraph, with each bar representing the mean, and error bars indicating the standard deviation. Each data point represents an individual biological replicate (n = 4).\nStatistically signiﬁcant differences were determined using an unpaired Student’s t-test. Thep value for the comparison of the editing efﬁciency between msDNA-PSlacZ-\nanti and msDNA-PSlacZ was 0.002714 in strain MG1655. In theΔmutS, ΔmutSrecJ, andΔmutSrecJsbcB strains, thep value for this comparison was <0.000001. **P < 0.005,\n****P < 0.0001. (C) Sequencing results of the genomiclacZ sequence of the target region. Mutations change the codons for tryptophan and glutamate at positions 17 and\n18 of the LacZ protein from TGG and GAA to stop codons (TGA and TAA). Red letters represent mutated bases.

Genomic ung and betI gene editing inΔmutSrecJsbcB strains harboring pUCung or pUCbetI plasmids, respectively.\n(A) A 92 bp homologous sequence of theung gene (PSung coding sequence) was inserted into themsd region. The msDNA-PSung, aligning with the genomic DNA lagging\nstrand, mediatesung gene editing, resulting in double base mutations.

The msDNA-PSbetI, aligning with the genomic DNA lagging strand, mediatesbetI gene editing, resulting in one base deletion.

Four colonies were randomly selected from each plate, and these colonies were pooled separately for each strain\n(one pool forΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUCung and one pool forΔmutSrecJsbcB-pUCbetI) to increase the number of cells analyzed for mutations. The regions surrounding the\ntargeted sequences in the genomicung and betI genes were separately ampliﬁed by PCR for each pool, followed by DNA sequencing. The DNA sequencing results reﬂect\nthe average editing efﬁciency within each pool. If editing is highly efﬁcient (close to 100%), we expect to see a dominant peak corresponding to the mutated sequence,\nwith a very small or undetectable peak for the wild-type sequence. Conversely, lower editing efﬁciency will result in a mixture of peaks, representing both mutated and\nwild-type sequences.

However, the mechanisms ofa c t i o no fm o s tr e t r o ne f f e c t o r s ,a n d\nhow phages evade retrons, are not well understood. Here, we show that some\nphages can evade retrons and other defense systems by producing speciﬁc\ntRNAs. Weﬁnd that expression of retron-Eco7 effector proteins (PtuA and\nPtuB) leads to degradation of tRNA\nTyr and abortive infection. The genomes of\nT5 phages that evade retron-Eco7 include a tRNA-rich region, including a\nhighly expressed tRNATyr gene, which confers protection against retron-Eco7.\nFurthermore, we show that other phages (T1, T7) can use a similar strategy,\nexpressing a tRNA\nLys, to counteract a tRNA anticodon defense system\n(PrrC170).\nBacteria evade phage infections by utilizing an immune mechanism\nreferred to as defense system. The retron defense system is com-\nposed of reverse transcriptase (RT), non-coding RNA, msrmsd, and\naccessory protein or an RT-fused domain with various enzymatic\nfunctions\n1–3. RT produces satellite msDNA molecules using msd RNA\nas the template4. There are 13 different types of retrons based on\ntheir genetic structure and accessory proteins5. The accessory pro-\ntein, which shows large diversity across different retrons5, is the\neffector protein that acts to abort phage infection through the\ninactivation of bacterial growth1. However, the defense mechanisms\nof many retrons remain unknown. Retron-Eco1 from group IIA is the\nonly one among retrons for which the defense mechanism has been\ncharacterized thus far\n6.\nRetron Ec78 (Retron-Eco7), a member of group I-A retrons,\nutilizes effector proteins derived from the Septu7 defense system,\nnamely PtuA and PtuB (collectively referred to as PtuAB)1,3.O u r\nresearch demonstrates that Retron-Eco7 employs its effector pro-\ntein to degrade bacterial tRNA\nTyr, which is markedly distinct from\nthe previously characterized PtuAB from Septu, known for\ndegrading DNA\n8. Discovered in the 1950s9, transfer RNAs (tRNAs)\nare essential in the central dogma of molecular biology10.B yt h e\n1960s, tRNAs were identi ﬁed in bacteriophages 11, and are now\nknown to be prevalent, particularly among virulent phages12.U s i n g\nT5 phages, we showed that T5-like phages utilize their own tRNATyr\nto rescue themselves from retron-Eco7. Further analysis using an\nanticodon nuclease PrrC170 cloned from a clinical isolate also\nshowed that phage tRNA can be used to rescue phage from PrrC170.\nIn response to antiphage defenses, phages have developed various\ncounter strategies, one of which is to encode proteins that inacti-\nvate the host defense\n13–16. Our study highlights the importance of\nphage tRNA in establishing a counterstrategy for the phage to\nescape the defense system.\nResults\nPhage genes that inhibit retron function\nWe previously isolated and characterized a broad host range\nEscherichia coli phage ΦSP15\n17, which has a high level of similarity\nwith T5j phage, a wildtype T5 from the phage collection of Jichi\nMedical University.

Each mutant was shown to carry an\napproximately 8-kb deletion in their genome, which was later found\nto encode multiple tRNAs and thus denoted as a\ntRNA-rich region\n(TRR) (Fig. 1a). Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the\nprevalence of the TRR in T5-like phages (Supplementary Fig. 1, Sup-\nplementary Data 1). We evaluated the ability of the phages to infect\nbacterial strains that contained different types of antiphage defense\nsystems\n3. In comparison with their respective wild-type strains (T5j\nand SP15), both deletion mutants, T5n andΦSP15m, exhibited a\nnotable decrease in infectivity against bacteria carrying retron-Eco2\n(Ec67) and retron-Eco7 (Ec78) (Fig.1b, Supplementary Fig. 2). The\nTRR ofΦSP15 was further divided into nine fragments (Fig.1c), each\nseparately cloned into plasmid carrying the pBAD inducible\npromoter\n18. They were subsequently transformed intoE. coliDH10B\ncells expressing retron-Eco2 or retron-Eco7 (Fig. 1c). The results\nrevealed that fragment 8 (F8 TRR) could rescue T5n andΦSP15m\nfrom both retrons, whereas fragment 6 (F6 TRR) could only rescue\nphages from retron-Eco7 (Fig.1d–f, Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). ORF75\nof ΦSP15 was discovered to be the genetic determinant within the F8\nTRR that enabled the phage to evade the Eco2 and Eco7 retrons\n(Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). Meanwhile, tRNA\nTyr in F6 TRR\nwas responsible for phage rescue from Eco7 (Fig.1h, Supplementary\nFig. 4e, f). The function of ORF75 will be characterized in future\nresearch. Hereafter we focus on the study of the tRNA\nTyr encoded in\nF6 TRR.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53789-y\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:9586 2\nPtuAB of retron I-A exhibits variations in the target molecule\nAs the inhibition of retron by overexpressing phage tRNATyr from F6\nTRR was speciﬁc to retron-Eco7 (Fig.1e, f), we focused on retron-Eco7\nto investigate whether our study could contribute to elucidating the\ndefense mechanism of this retron. Retron-Eco7 belongs to type I-A and\nhas two effector proteins, PtuA, which contains an ATPase domain, and\nPtuB, an HNH endonuclease\n1,3. We expressed the effector proteins\nindividually (PtuA or PtuB) or together (PtuAB) under the inducible\npromoter pBAD. PtuAB, but not the singly expressed effectors, was\nshown to trigger bacterial growth arrest, indicating that PtuA and PtuB\nare toxins of retron-Eco7 (Fig.2a, b). To assess the speciﬁcc o m p o n e n t\nwithin the retron complex capable of neutralizing the PtuAB toxin,\nindividual retron elements (msdmsr, RT, or PtuAB) were cloned into\ntwo different plasmids and co-expressed. Following expression of RT\nand PtuAB on separate plasmids, RT alone was inadequate at neu-\ntralizing PtuAB. Both msrmsd and RT were required for effective\nneutralization of PtuAB (Fig.2c, Supplementary Fig. 5). Thisﬁnding\nsuggests the presence of a tripartite toxin–antitoxin system in retron-\nEco7, resembling the previously documented retron-Sen2\n2.\nThe RNA hybridization assay showed that the bacterial tRNATyr\nwas signiﬁcantly depleted by retron-Eco7 PtuAB overexpression or\nduring infection of phage (Fig.2d, e, Supplementary Figs. 6a, 7 and 8).\nNext, tRNA sequencing conﬁrmed that bacterial tRNATyr, tRNATyrU\n(tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-2), and tRNATyrV (tRNA-Tyr-GTA-1-1) were down-\nregulated in bacteria expressing PtuAB (Fig. 2f, Supplementary\nFig. 6b–d, Supplementary Data 2). Taken together, these results reveal\nthat retron-Eco7 exerts its protective effect by aborting phage infec-\ntion through the depletion of bacterial tRNA\nTyr via PtuAB. However,\nfuture research is needed to clarify whether PtuA and PtuB are directly\nor indirectly responsible for tRNA cleavage.\nTo assess the universality of this mode of action, we used\nadditional PtuAB variants from the same subfamily, type I-A, retron-\nEco4 (Ec83) (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). In contrast to retron-Eco7,\nretron-Eco4 demonstrated a broad-spectrum defense activity, pro-\nviding bacterial protection against a variety of phages (Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 9d, e). Subsequently, we cloned the PtuAB of Eco4 and\nassessed its toxicity using the pBAD inducible promoter. Similar to\nEco7, the overexpression of PtuAB from retron-Eco4 resulted in\nbacterial growth arrest (Supplementary Fig. 9f). However, tRNA\nsequencing data revealed no downregulation of tRNA, suggesting\nthat PtuAB from retron-Eco4 does not target tRNA molecules (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 9g, Supplementary Data 3). Although Eco7 and Eco4\nbelong to the same retron subfamily, theseﬁndings indicate that\ntheir mechanisms of action differ.\nPhage uses strong promoter to overexpress tRNATyr and coun-\nteract retron-Eco7\nAs phage-derived tRNATyr (ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) in F6 TRR can rescue pha-\nges from retron-Eco7 (Fig.1h), we hypothesized thatΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15\nneutralizes retron-Eco7. As changing the anticodon sequence ofΦtRNA-\nTyr_SP15 or mutating the stem-loop sequence ofΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15\nabolished the neutralization effect ofΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15 (Fig.3a–e, Sup-\nplementary Fig. 10a, b), we presumed that the function ofΦtRNA-\nTyr_SP15 in protein synthesis is essential for retron defense evasion.\nComplementation of the exogenous tRNATyr by T5 tRNA Tyr\n(ΦtRNA-Tyr_T5), Klebsiella phage KpP_HS106 tRNA Tyr (ΦtRNA-\nTyr_KpP_HS106), orE. coliDH10B tRNATyr (Ec_tRNA-TyrU or Ec_tRNA-\nTyrV) in trans under the SP15-derived tRNA promoter (ΦtRNA-Tyr\npromoter) successfully restored phage infection to that ofΦtRNA-\nTyr_SP15. By contrast, only partial recovery was observed following\ncomplementation with theE. coli tRNA promoter (Ec_tRNA-Tyr pro-\nmoter (Fig.3f, Supplementary Fig. 10c, d), suggesting that the recovery\nof phage infection is promoter-dependent. Through the insertion of\nthe red ﬂuorescence protein (RFP) gene under theΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15\npromoter, we observed that this promoter displayed signiﬁcantly\nenhanced strength in comparison to RPF expression under either\nEc_tRNA-TyrU or Ec_tRNA-TyrV promoters (Supplementary Fig. 11).\nThe supplementation of tRNA represents a strategy employed\nby phages to evade different host defense systems\nTo investigate whether the utilization of phage tRNA is a widespread\nstrategy employed by phages to evade antiphage defense systems, we\nextended our analysis to include the PrrC defense system\n19.T h eP r r C\nsystem was screened from the genomes of various carbapenem-\nresistant bacteria\n20 using Defense Finder21. We selected a candidate,\ndesignated PrrC170, which was isolated from NIID carbapenem-\nresistant K. quasipneumoniaeisolate number 170. The toxin gene of\nPrrC170 harbors an ABC-ATPase domain and has 35% amino acid\nidentity with a well-known PrrC toxin, EcoPrrC (accession number:\nEER4567187)\n22 (Supplementary Fig. 12). We conﬁrmed that PrrC170 is\nan active antiphage defense system against at least two phages, T1 and\nT7 (Fig.3g, Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). We veriﬁed that overexpression\nof the PrrC toxin under the pBAD inducible promoter led to bacterial\ngrowth arrest (Fig. 3h). Subsequently, tRNA sequencing was con-\nducted on bacteria harboring the respective plasmid, ultimately elu-\ncidating that PrrC speciﬁcally targets tRNA\nLys (Fig. 3i, Supplementary\nData 4). Complementation with phage-derived tRNA Lys (ΦtRNA-\nLys_SP15) resulted in a restoration of phage infection of bacteria car-\nrying PrrC170, whereas complementation withE. coli-derived tRNA\nLys\n(Ec_tRNA-Lys) showed low restoration of phage infection (Fig.3i,\nSupplementary Fig. 13c). An additional complementation experiment\nusing phage-derived tRNA\nLys from various genera demonstrated that\nthese tRNA molecules enable phages to circumvent the PrrC170 sys-\ntem (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c). Collectively, theseﬁndings suggest\nthat the supplementation of tRNA in phages represents a strategy\nemployed by phages to evade host defense systems.\nIn summary, our experiments with retron-Eco7 and T5-like phages\nhave provided mechanistic model regarding the retron-Eco7 which\nFig. 1 | Identiﬁcation of phage genes involved in retron evasion. aGenomic\ncomparison of T5 and T5-like phage SP15.

Retron-Eco7 functions as a\ntripartite toxin-antitoxin system, where PtuAB act as toxin genes and\nretron msDNA and RT protein act as antitoxins. Upon phage infection,\nretron-Eco7 may be triggered, leading to the release of PtuAB, which\ncauses growth arrest by degrading bacterial tRNA\nTyr before the phage\ncan complete its replication cycle. However, T5 phages likely produce\nan abundance of their own tRNA\nTyr using a strong promoter, effectively\nbypassing the degradation of bacterial tRNATyr and ensuring successful\nphage replication. Further analysis has demonstrated that this tRNA\nsupplementation mechanism is not exclusive to retron-Eco7, thereby\nbroadening our understanding of the capability of phage tRNA to\ncounteract antiphage defenses.\nWe observed the co-localization of multiple tRNAs in the TRR\nregion. Given that defense systems typically co-reside with other\nantiphage systems within a single genomic island\n3,7,13,23,w es o u g h tt o\ndetermine if other known anti-defense proteins may also be present in\nthis region. However, our bioinformatics analysis revealed that TRR\ndid not display many known anti-defense genes (Supplemen-\ntary Data 5).\nDiscussion\nOur investigation into the TRR led to the identiﬁcation of the cellular\ntarget of retron-Eco7 effector proteins, PtuA and PtuB (collectively\nknown as PtuAB), which is tRNA\nTyr.

Taken together, PtuAB likely exhibits\nvariation in the target molecule.\ntRNAs are known to be present in the genomes of bacteriophages\ninfecting various bacterial genera\n12; however, their precise function\nremains elusive. Several hypotheses have been proposed, and the most\nwell-known is codon compensation, in which codons rarely used by the\nhost but required by the phage are supplemented by phage-encoded\ntRNAs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that phage-\nderived tRNAs tend to correspond with codons that are frequently\nused by phage-encoded genes\n12,25. Recent studies hint at another\npotential function of phage-derived tRNAs; they were discovered to be\nused by phages to counteract the depletion of host tRNAs that occurs\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53789-y\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:9586 5\nas a widespread response to phage infection26,27. Our data showed that\nT5 and SP15 phages can no longer infect bacteria protected by the\nretron-Eco7 defense system when they lose tRNATyr in the TRR, sug-\ngesting that the phage-derived tRNATyr is crucial for circumventing the\nretron-Eco7 defense. Noteworthy, we have identiﬁed that the phage\nutilizes an exceptionally strong promoter to express its tRNATyr,\nimplying that the phage evades retron-Eco7-mediated tRNATyr cleavage\nby producing a high abundance of tRNATyr.

During phage infection, retron-Eco7\nmay be triggered by an unknown mechanism, potentially leading to the release and\nactivation of PtuAB, which causes bacterial growth arrest by degrading bacterial\ntRNA\nTyr, thereby preventing the phage from completing its replication cycle.\nHowever, T5 phages produce an abundance of their own tRNATyr using a strong\npromoter, effectively bypassing retron-Eco7 and ensuring successful phage\nreplication.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53789-y\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:9586 6\nA recent study utilizing bioinformatic predictions identiﬁed\nmutational patterns in the anticodon loops of tRNAs encoded by\nmycobacteriophages32. These tRNAs are predicted to be resistant to\nhost anticodon tRNases. In line with our discovery of tRNA degrada-\ntion by Retron Eco7, another group recently demonstrated that phage\nT5 evades tRNA cleavage by the PARIS immunity through the expres-\nsion of a tRNA\nLys variant33. We believe that while tRNA levels are\nimportant, other factors such as the sequence and structure of the\ntRNA, particularly the loop region, may also play a crucial role in the\nability of tRNA\nTyr to rescue phage from retron-Eco7. TheE. coli-derived\ntRNATyr (Ec_tRNA-Tyr) and the phage-derived tRNATyr from SP15\n(ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) differ in both sequence and structure, which could\ninﬂuence how effectively they interact with retron-Eco7. These subtle\nvariations may enhance their ability to suppress retron-Eco7 activity.\nTo conﬁrm this hypothesis, further study is required, and we plan to\ninvestigate this in future research.\nAdditionally, we have demonstrated that phage-derived tRNAs\ncan also bypass the PrrC defense system as well. We noted that the\ntRNA\nLys used in this study comes from an unrelated phage, which\nmakes the experiment seem artiﬁcial. This was due to the limited\nnumber of phages we worked with, speciﬁcally the T-series phages\n(T1–T7). PrrC170 targets T1 and T7, but unfortunately, neither of\nthese phages encodes their own tRNA, making it difﬁcult to use them\nas models. To address this, we decided to use tRNALys from several\nphages that belong to different genera. Our results show that phage-\nderived tRNA\nLys from various sources can help phages overcome the\nPrrC system. Therefore, we believe that in nature, phages may use\ntRNA as one of their strategies to counteract host defense systems\nlike PrrC.\nTaken together, theseﬁndings strongly suggest the utilization of\nphage tRNA to evade defense systems is a widespread strategy\nemployed by phages. Most bacteria encode multiple defense systems,\nwith an average of 5 systems per genome\n21,23. This could be one of the\nreasons why T5-like phages, which carry multiple types of tRNAs in\ntheir genome, exhibit exceptionally broad host range\n17.\nWe noted that the depletion of tRNATyr during phage infection was\nsigniﬁcantly different between bacteria carrying retron-Eco7 infected\nwith SP15 and those infected with SP15m (Fig.2e). This difference is\nlikely due to the presence of ORF75 in the wild-type SP15, which may\nreduce the defense activity of retron-Eco7. However, we are currently\nunable to determine the detailed mechanism by which ORF75 inhibits\nretron-Eco7.\nMethods\nMedia and buffers\nAll experiments were conducted using Luria Bertani (LB) broth (10 g\npolypeptone, 10 g sodium chloride, and 5 g yeast extract per liter) or\nLB agar (LB supplemented with 1.5% agar). Phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS; 8.0 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na\n2HPO4,a n d0 . 2 4 gK H2PO4)w a s\nused for the dilution of the bacterial solutions, and sodium-\nmagnesium (SM) buffer (5.8 g NaCl, 0.2 g MgSO\n4.7H2O, 50 mL 1 M\nTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mL of 2% (w/v) gelatin solution) was used for\nphage storage and phage dilution.\nBacterial strains and phages\nBacterial strains and phages used in our experiments are listed in\nSupplementary Data 6. Defense systems were expressed inE. coli\nDH10B. Bacteria were grown in LB at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm\nunless speciﬁed otherwise, and the appropriate antibiotics were\nadded. Chemical competent E. coli DH10B cells were prepared\naccording to a previous study\n18. For exogenous genes expressed inE.\ncoli, tetracycline (10 μg/mL), ampicillin (100 μg/mL), or chlor-\namphenicol (20μg/mL) was used to ensure plasmid maintenance.\nPlasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 9.\nIsolation and preparation of phage stock\nPhage SP15 was previously isolated from sewage inﬂuent obtained\nfrom a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tokyo using the\ndouble-layer agar plating method\n17,34 with E. coliO157:H7 as the pro-\npagation host. The SP15 mutant (SP15m) was previously isolated from\nan in vitro co-culture of O157 and SP15 in the presence of fosfomycin17.\nT5n was obtained from the Biological Research Center, National\nInstitute of Technology and Evolution (Tokyo, Japan). T5j was obtained\nfrom the Department of Infection and Immunity, Division of Bacter-\niology, Jichi Medical University (Shimotsukeshi, Japan). Phages were\npropagated and puriﬁed using a previously described method\n35.\nBrieﬂy, the puriﬁed phage was propagated by mixing 1% O157 over-\nnight culture in liquid LB and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Host cells\nwere removed through centrifugation (5000 ×g,1 0m i n ,4° C )b e f o r e\nperforming phage concentration using the polyethylene glycol 6000-\nNaCl method. Finally, the phage solution wasﬁltered through a 0.2-µm\nﬁlter and used immediately or kept at 4 °C.\nPlasmid and strain constructions\nPlasmids carrying 33 different defense systems as well as one empty\nvector (pLG001–pLG034)3 were obtained from Dr. Feng Zhang (Broad\nInstitute, Boston, MA, USA). Plasmids encoding retron Ec83 (Eco4) was\nsynthesized and cloned at Genewiz (South Plainﬁeld, NJ, USA). For co-\nexpression of retron and TRR fragment, the retron-Eco7 and Eco4 were\ncloned under their native promoters using a plasmid with pSC101\norigin of replication (ori). The TRR fragments for retron-Eco7 was\nconstructed using pKLC23\n18 as a backbone with the pBAD-inducible\npromoter and pA15 origin of replication (ori). TRR fragments for\nretron-Eco2 were constructed using pKLC83\n18, with pBR322 ori as a\nbackbone, along with the pBAD-inducible promoter. To construct the\nplasmid carrying different tRNA\nTyr shown in Fig.3f, the oligonucleo-\ntides of the tRNAs were synthesized at Euroﬁns (Tokyo, Japan) and\nintroduced into the plasmid using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly\n(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, catalog number #E2621). The\nplasmid carrying tRNA\nLys from various phages in Supplementary Fig. 14\nwas synthesized at Euroﬁns (Tokyo, Japan) under the pBR322 ori.\nTo construct a plasmid with the PrrC toxin–antitoxin (TA) system,\nthe presence of the PrrC TA system was searched in the genome of 400\nNIID clinical isolates using Defenseﬁnder21.T h eP r r Cf r o mc a r b a p e n e m -\nresistant K. quasipneumoniae isolate number 170 (NIID accession\nnumber: JBEAAAI-19-0008) was used for further experiments. The\npredicted PrrC TA system, which consists of four genes (HsdR, HsdS,\nPrrC, and HsdM), including 300 nucleotides before the start codon of\nHsdR, was cloned into plasmid pLG001. Plasmid assembly was per-\nformed using NEBuilder® Hiﬁ DNA assembly (New England Biolabs,\nI p s w i c h ,M A ,U S A ,c a t a l o gn u m b e r#E2621). Plasmid constructs were\ntransformed intoE. coliDH10B using the heat shock method.\nTo construct a plasmid expressing the RFP under the tRNA pro-\nmoter, we predicted the tRNA promoters using the BPROM prediction\ntool (http://www.softberry.com). The predicted promoters fromE.\ncoli-derived tRNA-Tyr (tRNA_Tyr-GTA-1 and tRNA_Tyr-GTA-2) and\nphage-derived tRNA-Tyr (ΦtRNA-Tyr_SP15) were ampliﬁed from theE.\ncoli DH10B genome and the phage SP15 genome, respectively. Therfp\ngene, including the ribosome-binding site and therrnB T1 terminator\nsequence, was ampliﬁed from the pKLC23-RFP plasmid\n18. The plasmid\nbackbone was obtained from pKLC8318. The three fragments were PCR\nampliﬁed using Q5 High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (New England Biolabs,\ncatalog number #M0492S), and the plasmids were circularly assem-\nbled using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly. Theﬂuorescence intensity\nof RFP was quantiﬁed using the GloMax® Explorer Multimode Micro-\nplate Reader (Promega, Madison, USA) and was subsequently nor-\nmalized with respect to the optical density (OD\n600). The oligo primers,\nsynthetic DNA, and synthetic plasmid used in this study are listed in\nSupplementary Data 6–9.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53789-y\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:9586 7\nBacteriophage spot assay\nSpot assay was performed using fresh culture that was prepared by\ninoculating 1% overnight bacterial culture into LB supplemented with\nappropriate antibiotic(s) until an OD\n600 of ~2 was reached. A bacterial\nlawn for spot assay was prepared using 100μL fresh culture in 4 mL LB\ntop agar (LB, 0.5% agarose, 1 mM CaCl2)a n dp o u r e do n t oL Bp l a t e .\nPhage was serially diluted using SM buffer in 96-well plates. Next, 3µL\nof phage solution was tenfold serially diluted and dropped onto the\nplate using a multichannel pipet and incubated at room temperature\nuntil it dried, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. After over-\nnight incubation, formation of lysis zones (plaques) was recorded.\nEfﬁciency of Plating of a phage is calculated by comparing the number\nof plaque-forming units (PFUs) on a test strain to the number of PFUs\non a reference strain.\nCytotoxicity assay for PtuAB and PrrC\nPtuAB from retron-Eco7 (pLG008) or PrrC from PrrC170 were cloned\ninto the pKLC23 plasmid under the pBAD-inducible promoter using\nNEBuilder® Hiﬁ assembly (New England Biolabs). For PtuAB from Eco4\n(pNK83), the PtuAB was cloned into the pKLC83a plasmid, a derivative\nof pKLC83 with the pBAD-inducible promoter. The resulting plasmid\nconstruct was introduced intoE. coli DH10B using the heat shock\nprotocol. A single bacterial colony that carries PtuAB was inoculated in\n2 mL LB with chloramphenicol (for pKLC23) or ampicillin (for\npKLC83a) and was incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking at\n200 rpm (until OD\n600 was ~5). Overnight cultures were serially diluted\neight times (tenfold) in LB. Next, approximately 3μL of each dilution\nwas spotted on an LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics and\neither 0.2% arabinose, 0.2% glucose, or no sugars. The plates were\nincubated at 37 °C overnight.\nTA assay of retron-Eco7\nTo identify the speciﬁc components within the retron complex capable\nof neutralizing the PtuAB toxin, individual retron components\n(msrmsd, RT, or PtuAB) were cloned into two different plasmids and\nco-expressed. The toxin component, PtuAB, was expressed under the\npBAD inducible plasmid from pKL83a. The antitoxin candidate\n(msrmsd, RT, or msrmsd-RT) was constitutively expressed under its\nnative promoter from retron-Eco7 (from plasmid pLG008). A plasmid\ncarrying msrmsd was created by deleting RT and PtuAB from pLG008,\nwhile plasmid carrying RT was created by deleting msrmsd and PtuAB.\nFor cytotoxicity assay, a single bacterial colony that carries PtuAB and\nantitoxin candidate was inoculated in 2 mL LB with chloramphenicol\nand ampicillin and was incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking at\n200 rpm (until OD\n600 was ~5). Overnight cultures were serially diluted\neight times (tenfold) in LB. Next, approximately 3μL of each dilution\nwas spotted on an LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics and\neither 0.2% arabinose, 0.2% glucose, or no sugars. The plates were\nincubated at 37 °C overnight.\nFor toxicity assay of bacteria co-expressing the retron-Eco7\ncomponent in two inducible plasmids. The toxin component, PtuAB,\nwas expressed under the pBAD inducible promoter, whereas the anti-\ntoxin component RT/msrmsd/both RT and msrmsd were expressed\nunder the pATc inducible promoter. The antitoxin candidate was\ncontinuously expressed by adding 50 ng/mL of anhydrous\ntetracycline.\nD o tB l o tR N Ah y b r i d i z a t i o n\nAn overnight culture ofE. coliDH10B harboring plasmid pBAD-PtuAB\nfrom Retron-Eco7 was inoculated into 10 mL LB supplemented with\nchloramphenicol (20μg/mL) until an OD600 of 0.3 was reached. The\nbacteria were subsequently induced with 0.2% arabinose (to induce\nPtuAB expression) or 0.2% glucose (to repress PtuAB expression) and\ncultured for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Following incubation,\nthe culture was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 5 min, and the pellet was\nwashed twice with PBS buffer. Total RNA was extracted using a miRNA\nisolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog number #217004),\naccording to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The total RNA was\nsubmitted for dot blot RNA hybridization service of Genostaff Inc.\n(Tokyo, Japan).\nFor the RNA dot blot analysis of bacteria infected with phage,\nbacteria carrying pLG008 (retron-Eco7) or pLG001 (empty vector)\nwere infected with SP15 or SP15m for 20 min. Bacteria without phage\ninfection was used as negative control. The samples were then cen-\ntrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and washed twice with SM buffer. The\nbacterial pellet was subjected to RNA extraction using a miRNA isola-\ntion kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog number #217004),\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was\nthen submitted for dot blot RNA hybridization at Genostaff Inc.\n(Tokyo, Japan).\nPuriﬁed RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min and twofold\nserially diluted. Diluted RNAs were spotted onto HyBond N+ mem-\nbrane (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA, Catalog number #RPN1210B)\nand the membranes were baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Baked membranes\nwere pre-hybridized with DIG EasyHyb (Roche, Basel, Switzerland,\nCatalog number #1603558) at 68 °C for 1 h followed by hybridization\nwith 10 pmol/mL of DIG-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to\ntarget RNA for 15 h. Membranes were washed with 2× saline sodium\ncitrate (SSC)/0.1% SDS twice at room temperature for 10 min, 0.1× SSC/\n0.1% SDS twice for 15 min, and with TBS-T at room temperature for\n5 min. The temperature conditions for hybridization and washing were\nadjusted according to the probe. Phage-tRNA-tyr-new-AS was set at\n50 °C,E.coli-tRNA-tyr-AS at 60 °C, and 16S rRNA-AS at 60 °C. The\nsequences of each probe are as follows: Phage-tRNA-tyr-new-AS: 5′-\nDIG-AACCACCCGAGACCCTTCCGAGTCGG-3′, E.coli-tRNA-tyr-AS: 5′-\nDIG-TCCCTTTGGCCGCTCGGGAACCCCACC-3′,a n d1 6 Sr R N A - A S :5′-\nDIG-GATTCCGACTTCATGGAGTCGAGTTGCAGACTCCAATCCG-3′.\nThereafter, membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (Roche,\nCatalog number # 1096176) at room temperature for 30 min and\nprobed with 10,000-diluted anti-digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments\n(Roche, Catalog number #1093274) in blocking buffer at room tem-\nperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-T three times at\nroom temperature for 10 min and rinsed with detection buffer (0.1 M\nTris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5.) Signals were detected using 100-diluted\nCSPD substrate (Roche, Catalog number # 1655884.).\nThe dot blot results were quantiﬁed using ImageJ\n36 software. The\nquantiﬁed data were then normalized by dividing each value by the\naverage value obtained from the negative control. In Fig.2d, the\nnegative control was PtuAB without induction (Glucose added). In\nFig. 2e, the negative control was bacteria carrying an empty vector and\ninfected with phage. Statistical analysis for Fig.2d, e was performed\nusing thet-test available in GraphPad Prism software.\ntRNA sequencing\ntRNA sequencing was performed by Filgen, Inc. (Nagoya, Japan).\nSequencing, data curation, and bioinformatic analysis were performed\nby Arraystar Inc. (Rockvile, MD, USA, project codes #J_120222-tRNA-\nseq-16 and #J_190923-tRNAseq-16). Total RNA from each sample was\nquantiﬁed using NanoDrop ND-1000 (Marshall Scientiﬁc, Hampton,\nNH, USA). tRNAs were puriﬁed from total RNA samples and m1A&m3C\ndemethylated before being partially hydrolyzed according to the\nHydro-tRNAseq method. The partially hydrolyzed and re-\nphosphorylated tRNAs were next converted to small RNA sequen-\ncing libraries using NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for\nIllumina® kit (New England Biolabs). Size selection of∼140–155-bp\nPCR-ampliﬁed fragments (corresponding to∼19–35 nt tRNA fragments\nsize range) was performed. The resultant tRNA-seq libraries were\nqualiﬁed and quantiﬁed using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Santa\nClara, CA, USA). We then equally mixed all libraries and sequenced for\n50 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system using NextSeq 500/550\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53789-y\nNature Communications|         (2024) 15:9586 8\nHigh-Output v2 kit (75 cycles) following the manufacturer ’s\ninstructions.\nSequencing quality was examined using the FastQC software, and\ntrimmed reads (passed Illumina qualityﬁlter, trimmed 3′-adaptor\nbases by cutadapt) were aligned to the cytoplasmic mature-tRNA\nsequences obtained from the GtRNAdb BWA37 software. For tRNA\nalignment, the maximum mismatch was 238.T h et R N Ae x p r e s s i o n\nproﬁle was analyzed based on uniquely mapped reads and including\nmapped reads. The differentially expressed tRNAs were screened\nbased on the count value using the R package edgeR\n39.P r i n c i p a l\ncomponent analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering,\nscatter plots, Venn plots, and volcano plots were performed with the\ndifferentially expressed tRNAs in R or Python environment for statis-\ntical computing and graphics.

In this study, we found a novel retron, retron‐Vmi1 (Vm85) fromVibrio mimicus.\nThe retron is comprised of themsr‐msd region, orf323, and theret gene, a genetic organization similar toSalmonella's retron‐\nSen2 (St85). The protein sequence of the RNA‐directed DNA polymerase (RT‐Vmi1) is highly homologous to the RTs ofVibrio\nmetoecus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, andVibrio vulnificus. Phylogenetic and protein sequence similarity analysis of retron‐Vmi1\nORF323 and RT revealed a close relatedness to retron‐Sen2. We found that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted in thedusA gene, similar\nto the insertion of the retron‐Vpa1 (Vp96) ofV. parahaemolyticus AQ3354, suggesting that retrons can be transferred via the\ntRNA gene. These results are the first convincing evidence that retron is moving across species. The neighboring genes of\nretron‐Vmi1 shared high homology with the genetic environment ofV. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus retrons. We also\nfound two junction points within the retron‐Vmi1 and thedusA gene suggesting that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted into this site in a\ntwo‐step manner.\n1 | Introduction\nRetrons are retro‐elements that are inserted into the bacterial\nchromosome or as part of a large prophage DNA element in\ndifferent bacterial species [1, 2]. Retrons are essential to pro-\nduce msDNA, a small satellite DNA‐RNA complex. The retron\nis comprised of anmsr (RNA coding region),msd (DNA coding\nregion), and the ret (reverse transcriptase, RT) gene [3]. Bac-\nterial RTs have the ability to synthesize both double‐strand\nDNA and single‐stranded cDNA [4]. Retrons are speculated as\nmobile elements according to msDNAs similarities, properties,\nand amino acid identity of RTs as well as the transposition of\nretron in the genome [5, 6]. Only one definitive function has\nbeen attributed to retrons: their role in phage defense [7–9].\nThis is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution‐NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original\nwork is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.\n© 2024 The Author(s).Microbiology and Immunologypublished by The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.\nAbbreviations: AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; CT, cholera toxin; DDBJ, DNA Data Bank of Japan;EAEC, enteroaggregative\nEscherichia coli; ENA, European Nucleotide Archives; EPEC, enteropathogenicEscherichia coli; IPTG, isopropylβ‐thiogalactoside; msDNA, multicopy single‐stranded DNA; ORF, open reading frame;\nRSL, RNA stem loop; RT, reverse transcriptase; ssR, single stranded RNA.\nJant Cres Caigoy and Toshi Shimamoto contributed equally to this study.\n1o f7 6Microbiology and Immunology, 2025; 69:1–9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.13181\nRetron elements associated with phage defense consist of three\nfunctional components: themsr‐msd regions, theret gene, and\nan effector gene, which encodes a protein responsible for the\nactual defense mechanism against phages [7].\nIt is suggested that the distribution of retron in prokaryotes\nis facilitated by lateral gene transmission as indicated\nb yt h ed i f f e r e n c ei nt h eG Cc o n t e n to ft h er e t r o nw i t ht h e\nhost genome [2]. Horizontal gene transfer and acquisition of\nf o r e i g nD N Ai saf u n d a m e n t a lp r o c e s si nt h ee v o l u t i o no f\nmost bacterial species [10]. The acquisition of mobile genetic\nelements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, transposons,\nintegrative and conjugative elements, and genomic islands\nallows bacteria to instantly obtain a range of genetic traits\nthat may increase fitness under different environmental\nconditions [11].\nAlthough widely distributed i n prokaryotes, the retrons in\nthe bacteria population of the same species or related species\nseemed to be uncommon [2]. Nowadays, retrons have been\nisolated from different pathogenic bacteria such as en-\nteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), a classical en-\nteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Klebsiella pneumoniae ,\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Vibrio cho-\nlerae [12–17]. As a close relative of V. cholerae , Vibrio mi-\nmicus has been implicated as one of the causative agents of\ngastroenteritis including other infections [ 18, 19]. The vir-\nulence determinants of V. mimicus have not been well\nc h a r a c t e r i z e d ,b u tr e c e n t l yi tw a ss h o w nt h a ts o m eV. mi-\nmicus strains harbor VPI ‐1 (TCP) and CTX φ (CTX) and\nproduce multiple toxins, including haemolysin, zonula oc-\ncludens toxin, a heat ‐stable enterotoxin, and CT ‐like\ntoxin [20–24].\nIn this study, we characterized a novel retron, retron‐Vmi1,\nidentified in V. mimicus, and provided insights into its genetic\norganization, evolutionary relationships, and potential mecha-\nnisms of interspecies transfer. Our results contribute to a better\nunderstanding of retron biology and the dynamics of genetic\ntransfer among bacterial species.\n2 | Materials and Methods\n2.1 | msDNA Isolation\nV. mimicus CS30 (ctx+) was used in this study. The strain was\ngrown in Lennox broth (LB) supplemented with 1.5% NaCl\n(final concentration) at 37°C. msDNA fromV. mimicus CS30\nwas isolated by the alkaline lysis method, similar to plasmid\nextraction, as described previously [13].\n2.2 | Labeling and Sequencing of msDNA\nThe DNA part of msDNA was separated by polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and purified by electroelution. The DNA part of\nmsDNA was labeled at the 3′ end with [α‐32P] dideoxyATP and\nterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and purified by urea/\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [25].\nThe DNA sequence of msDNA‐Vmi1 (Vm85) was determined\nby the Maxam‐Gillbert method as described previously [26].\nBased on the sequence of the msDNA part, the retron region\nwas cloned by inverse PCR, and the nucleotide sequence was\nthen determined. The secondary structure of the msDNA ‐\nVmi1 was predicted using the GENETYX‐MAC software [27].\n2.3 | DNA Sequencing of Retron Region by\nInverse PCR\nChromosomal DNA ofV. mimicus CS30 was prepared by con-\nventional method and DNA was digested with several restriction\nenzymes [28]. DNA fragments were ligated by using TaKaRa\nLigation kit Ver.2 (Takara, Japan) for self‐ligation. We used this\nDNA as a template for PCR. Amplification reactions were carried\nout with 100 ng of DNA and PCR reaction mixture containing\n100 µM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2,2 5 p m o lo f\nprimers, and 1U of Phusion Hot Start High‐Fidelity DNA poly-\nmerase (FINNZYMES, Finland) and brought to a final volume of\n50 µL using distilled water. Primers were designed based on the\nmsDNA sequence. The PCR cycle included initial denaturation at\n98°C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 5 s at 98°C,\nprimer annealing for 30 s at 55°C, extension for 3 min at 72°C, and\na final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR fragment was then\npurified from the agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit\n(Qiagen KK, Japan). Both DNA strands of the PCR product were\nsequenced using an ABI automatic DNA sequencer (Model\n3730xl; Applied Biosystems).\n2.4 | Cloning of Retron ‐Vmi1\nRetron‐Vmi1 was amplified with the following reaction mixture:\n100 ng of chromosomal DNA, 100 µM deoxynucleoside tri-\nphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of primers (ret‐F1, ret‐R12)\nand 1U of Phusion Hot Start High‐Fidelity DNA polymerase\n(FINNZYMES, Finland) with a final volume of 50 µL. Primers\nwere designed to amplify a full‐length retron‐Vmi1. The PCR cycle\nincluded initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles\nof denaturation for 5 s at 98°C, primer annealing for 30 s at 55°C,\nextension for 1.5 min at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C\nfor 7 min. The PCR fragment was then purified from the agarose\ngel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen KK, Japan).\nRetron‐Vmi1 was cloned into SmaI‐digested pBluescript II SK\n(‐) (Stratagene, USA) using the TaKaRa Ligation Kit Ver.2 (Takara,\nJapan). Then, the ligation mixtures were used to transformE. coli\nTG1 competent cells. Bacteria were grown in an LB agar medium\nsupplemented with 50 mg/L of X‐Gal, 1 mM IPTG, and 100 µg/mL\nof ampicillin. Positive colonieswere screened by a white/blue\nselection protocol. The recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated\nfrom the transformed cells by using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit\n(Qiagen KK, Japan) and the DNA sequence of the insert was\ndetermined for both strands.\n2.5 | Genomic Analysis of Retron‐Vmi1\nThe location of retron‐Vmi1 from V. mimicus CS30 was iden-\ntified based on the nucleotide sequence of the msDNA‐Vmi1.\n2o f7 6 Microbiology and Immunology, 2025\nThe msd region was determined according to the nucleotide\nsequence of msDNA‐Sen2. The retron promoter was identified\nbased on the conserved promoter sequence using the\nGENETYX‐MAC software. The ORF323 and RT nucleotide\nsimilarity search was carried out using the BLAST program\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). TheattL and attR sites\nwere located based on the LOGO consensus sequences ofattL\nand attR direct repeats from dusA‐specific genome island\nsequences [28].\nTo construct the sequence similarity network (SSN), amino acid\nsequence BLAST of V. mimicus ORF323 and RT‐Vmi1 was\ninitially performed in the EFI‐enzyme similarity tool (EFI‐EST)\nset at UNIPROT BLAST querye‐value of Log\n−5 [29, 30]. The\nSSN was then constructed and visualized in Cytoscape 3.10.1\nsoftware using the organic layout [31]. Nodes were connected in\nORF323 and RT by 45% and 55%, respectively. This was based\non the percent similarity with retron‐Sen2 ORF320 and RT‐\nSen2, respectively.\nFor the phylogenetic analysis, the nucleotide sequence of RT‐Vmi1\nand representative RTs (N = 24) of other bacterial retrons were\naligned by ClustalW, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree\n(1000 bootstrap replicates) [32] was constructed using the MEGA\n10.1.8. program [33]. To construct the phylogenetic network,\nadditional RT sequences (N =8 1 ) w e r e i n c l u d e d a n d a l i g n e d\nconsequently. RT nucleotide sequences were collated using the\nDnaSP 6.12.03 software resulting to 41 unique RT sequences\n(considered as RT haplotypes) [34]. The phylogenetic network was\nthen constructed using the TCS method [35]i nP o p A r t1 . 7s o f t -\nware [36].\n3 | Results and Discussion\n3.1 | Identification of msDNA ‐Vmi1\nThe DNA part of msDNA was purified from the gel by elec-\ntroelution after separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophor-\nesis, and then the DNA sequence was determined as described\nabove (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession No. LC791609). The\nDNA sequence data showed that the msDNA isolated from\nV. mimicus consists of 85 bases of single‐stranded DNA and is,\nthus, referred to as msDNA‐Vmi1 (Figure 1).\nAccording to the common structural features of all msDNAs\nidentified to date and the mechanism of msDNA biosynthesis\n[24], msDNA‐Vmi1 was predicted to be branched out from\nthe guanosine residue (branching G) (Figure1, red highlight)\nat the 12th position of the RNA molecule by a unique 2′,5 ′‐\nphosphodiester linkage, a distinctive feature essential for the\nreverse transcriptase‐mediated priming [37]. The length of the\nRNA part of msDNA‐Vmi1 was predicted to be 79 bases from\nthe msr gene of retron‐Vmi1 as determined by the identified\nconserved a1/a2 inverted repeat sequences (Figure3). The RNA\nregion is comprised of two RNA stem loops (RSL1 and RSL2),\nthree single‐stranded RNA segments (ssRa‐c), and a DNA‐RNA\nduplex. Interestingly, the DNA stem structure of msDNA‐Vmi1\ncontained a mismatched base pair in its DNA stem (Figure1,\nyellow highlight). msDNAs from other pathogenic bacteria\ncontaining mismatched base pairs in their DNA stem ‐loop\nstructure are regarded as potentially mutagenic [38]. By com-\nparing the msDNA‐Vmi1 structure with other msDNAs isolated\nfrom pathogenic bacteria, we found a number of conserved\nregions that are present in all msDNAs of these bacteria (Fig-\nure 1, blue highlights), especially msDNA ‐Sen2 from\nS. Typhimurium. Sequence homology search showed that\nFIGURE 1 | Possible secondary structure of msDNA ‐Vmi1 from\nVibrio mimicus.

The location of the\ngenes and their transcriptional directions are indicated by arrows. The\norf323 of retron‐Vmi1 shares significant similarity with the effector\ntoxin RcaT (orf320) of retron‐Sen2 (Figure 5A).\n3o f7 6\nV. mimicus CS30 msr‐msd region (msDNA‐Vmi1) shares 100%\nnucleotide homology with V. vulnificus msDNA region, 73.7%\nwith msDNA ‐Sen2 (from S. Typhimurium), 64.2% with\nmsDNA‐Eco4 (Ec83) (from EAEC), 61.7% with msDNA‐Vpa1\n(Vp96) (from V. parahaemolyticus), 60.5% with msDNA‐Eco7\n(Ec78) (from EPEC), and 60.4% with msDNA ‐Vch1 (Vc95)\n(from V. cholerae).\nThe conserved tetra nucleotides (Figure 1, dotted box) 5′‐\nTAGA‐3′ (in msDNA ‐Sen2, msDNA ‐Vch1 (Vc95), and\nmsDNA‐Vpa1 or 5′‐TTGA‐3′ (msDNA‐Eco4) that plays an\nimportant role during recognition and cleavage of msDNA\nwas not found in msDNA ‐Vmi1 [ 39]. msDNA ‐Vmi1 con-\nserved tetra nucleotides 5′‐TCAG‐3′ was similar to msDNA‐\nEco1 (Ec85) (Wang et al., 2022). The cleavage site (Figure1,\ngreen highlight) was conserved among the evaluated\nmsDNA [39]. In the msrRNA, the SLR2a n ds s R c ,r e p o r t e dt o\nexhibit extensive contact with the reverse transcriptase in\nmsDNA‐Eco1, were also conserved in the msDNA‐Vmi1 [40].\nThis ssRc together with the DNA ‐RNA complex is also\nfound to sit in proximity with the reverse transcriptase active\nsite YADD (Figure 7)[ 40] ,w h i c hi sa l s oc o n s e r v e da m o n g\nthe retron‐RTs. These common conserved sequences could\ndenote a common evolutionary origin, and it is interesting to\nexamine whether these sequences are associated with\npathogenicity.\n3.2 | Organization of Retron ‐Vmi1\nThe DNA sequence data retrieved from this study revealed a\nnovel retron inV. mimicus, designated as retron‐Vmi1, the first\nreported retron element in V. mimicus. Retron‐Vmi1 is an\noperon of approximately 2.2 kb consisting of two open reading\nframes (ORFs), including the RT (Figure2). A putative inner\nmembrane protein, designated as ORF323, with 323 amino\nacid residues is present between the RT (RT‐Vmi1; 302 aa) and\nmsr‐msd region. This genetic organization is similar to that\nreported for S. Typhimurium retron‐Sen2 [13]. The promoter\nregion prediction of retron‐Vmi1 was predicted 6 bp upstream\nof the msr–msd region as it contains well‐conserved −35 and\n−10 regions (Figure3).\nUpstream of retron ‐Vmi1, there are two unknown ORFs,\nORF276 and ORF133, and they have shown high homology to\nthe proteins downstream of retron ‐Vpa1, ORF114, and\nORF279 (Figure 4). Downstream of retron ‐Vmi1 are three\nproteins: ORF356 (AAA family ATPase), ORF361 (site ‐\nspecific integrase), and ORF359 (site ‐specific integrase),\nwhich are homologous to proteins located on the upstream\nregion of retron ‐Vpa1. The organization of retron ‐Vmi1 is\nsimilar to retron ‐Eco3 isolated from a clinical isolate of\nE. coli [41], retron ‐Sen2 from S. Typhimurium [12], and\nretron‐Vch2 (Vc81) from a non ‐O1/non‐O139 V. cholerae\nFIGURE 3 | Nucleotide sequence of the upstream and promoter region and themsr‐msd region of retron‐Vmi1. Sequences correspond to the\nnucleotide region 3118–3456 and 5398–5510 (DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Accession No. LC791609). The second and third lines are shown as double‐\nstranded DNA. The direct repeat region is boldfaced. The predicted promoter sequences (−35 and−10) are underlined. The branching guanosine in\nthe msr region is circled. The boldfaced regions indicate the conserved a1/a2 inverted repeat sequences.

SSN analysis of ORF323 with other bac-\nterial species also revealed that the protein is closely related to\nthe retron‐Sen2 family effector protein (Figure5A). Although\nthe amino acid sequences of these ORFs have significant\nhomology, their associated retrons exist differently on the\nbacterial chromosome. For example, retron‐Eco3 is associated\nwith a prophage, while retron ‐Sen2 appears to be inserted\ndirectly in the chromosome, suggesting that retrons can be\ninserted in different mechanisms.\n3.3 | Comparison of the RT‐Vmi1 with the RT\nfrom Other Vibrios\nWe then investigated the homology of RT‐Vmi1 to otherVibrio\nspp. and observed 100% identity (301/301 aa) with both\nV. metoecusand V. parahaemolyticusand 99.34% (299/301 aa) in\nV. vulnificus (Figure 6).\nIn addition, we also investigated the homology of\nRT‐Vmi1 with the retron RT of other pathogenic bacteria.\nThe highest similarities to RT ‐Vmi1 were with RT ‐Sen2\n(from S. Typhimurium, 56.5% identity), RT ‐Vch1 (from\nV. cholerae , 44.5% identity), RT ‐Eco4 (from aggregative\nadherence E. coli , AAEC, 43.7% identity), RT ‐Vpa1 (from\nV. parahaemolyticus , 45.4% identity), RT ‐Eco7 (from en-\nteropathogenic E. coli, EPEC, 44.5% identity), and RT‐Vch2\n(from V. cholerae, 46.8% identity). The SSN of RT‐Vmi1 ex-\nhibits that RT‐Vmi1 is more closely related to RT‐Sen2 as it\nis located at the Salmonella c l u s t e ro v e rt h eVibrio cluster\n(Figure 5B).\nMultiple amino acid sequence alignments also revealed that\nt h e s eR T ss h a r es e v e r a lh i g h l yconserved domains in addition\nto the highly conserved catalytic tetrad YADD (residues\n193–196), the retron‐specific region containing the NAXXH\n(residues 90–94) and VTG triplet (residues 244–246) that are\npresent in all retron RTs (Figure 7)[ 43, 44]. This suggests\nthat RTs associated with retrons exhibit high sequence sim-\nilarity when they share similar genetic organization. The\nhigh similarity indicates that these RTs are likely to perform\nsimilar functions, specifically in the production or regulation\nof msDNAs in bacteria.\nFIGURE 6 | Amino acid alignment of RT‐Vmi1 with the RTs fromVibrio parahaemolyticus PHLUSAVBR00185 and Vibrio vulnificus V252.\nSimilar amino acid residues are denoted by dots.\nFIGURE 5 | Amino acid sequence similarity network (SSN) ofVibrio mimicusCS30 (A) ORF323 and (B) RT. The network was thresholded at a\nBLAST E‐value of 1 × 10−5. Sequence BLAST and network data were generated using the EFI‐EST database, and the SSN was constructed in\nCytoscape using an organic layout. The ORF323 full network contains 342 nodes with edges connected at≥ 45% identity. The RT full network\ncontains 978 nodes with edges connected at≥ 55% identity.\n5o f7 6\n3.4 | Phylogenetic Analysis of RT‐Vmi1\nWe then carried out a phylogenetic analysis of RT‐Vmi1 to\ndetermine its genetic lineage. A phylogenetic tree was con-\nstructed using the nucleotide sequences of ret (RT) genes\n(Figure 8). The phylogenetic tree analysis showed a significant\ndiversity among the host bacterial species, as RT ‐Vmi1 of\nV. mimicusassociates closely with RT‐Sen2 ofS. Typhimurium\nrather than the RT ‐Vch1 of V. cholerae and RT ‐Vpa1 of\nV. parahaemolyticus. The data indicate that several bacterial\nspecies, including E. coli, Salmonella, and Vibrio, have likely\nacquired the retron very similar to retron ‐Sen2 through a\ntransduction event. This is evidenced by the related retron‐Eco3\n(Figure 2), which is still found in a functional prophage DNA.\nThe presence of bothattL and attR sites also suggests that these\nretrons are associated with prophage DNA sequences (Fig-\nure 4). These results substantiate that retrons are indeed mobile\ngenetic elements, which can migrate between different bacterial\nspecies. The phylogenic tree showed the RTs from investigated\nVibrio species split into two subclades, one associated withE.\ncoli RTs and one with Salmonella Sen2 family RTs. The 1‐A\nretron type under which retron‐Eco7, Eco4, Vpa1, and Vch1\nbelong is characterized by an associated/fused protein domain\ncontaining an N‐terminal ATPase module [45]. Whereas retron‐\nSen2, Vch2, and Eco3 (Ec73) contain an N‐terminal nucleoside\ndeoxyribosyltransferase‐like (NDT) + C‐terminal DNA binding\ndomain, a characteristic also shared by retron‐Vmi1. It is no\nsurprise that RT‐Vmi1 is more closely related to theV. cholerae\nnon‐O1/non‐O139 RT (RT‐Vch2) than RT‐Vch1 of pathogenic\nV. cholerae (Figure 8). Such observation could provide infor-\nmation on the evolutionary process of\nV. mimicus from V.\ncholerae.\nA haplotype network was constructed to get a clearer rela-\ntionship of RT‐Vmi1 with otherret genes associated with the\nretron element. From the representative nucleotide\nsequences used in the phylogenetic tree construction, we\nhave included additional RT sequences to extensively evalu-\nate this genetic relationsh ip. Given that retrons are\nmobile elements, the TCS network validates that RT ‐Vmi1\ncould have descended from S. enterica (RT‐Sen2) through\nV. parahaemolyticus (Figure 9). The RTs from V. metoecus\nand V. vulnificus c o u l dh a v ea l s ou n d e r g o n et h es a m ep r o -\ncess. Moreover, the RTs from different Vibrio species, espe-\ncially V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus , were scattered\nthroughout the network and did not form a distinct clade\nindicating that the retro n element across different Vibrio\nFIGURE 7 | Amino acid alignment of RTs from different bacterial retrons.

Branch lengths represent the\nexpected substitutions per site.6o f7 6 Microbiology and Immunology, 2025\nspecies is likely to be more distributed compared to\nS. enterica retrons. This could be attributed to the ubiquity of\nvibrios in aquatic ecosystems where the mobility of mobile\ngenetic elements, including retrons, is less restricted.\n3.5 | Retron ‐Vmi1 is Inserted into thedusA Gene\nWe further examined the nucleotide sequences upstream and\ndownstream of retron‐Vmi1 to find out its insertion environment in\nFIGURE 10 | Structure and similarity of retron‐Vmi1 and its genomic environment with otherVibrio species. The location of the genes and their\ntranscriptional directions are indicated by arrows.

Black circles indicate unsampled RT haplotypes.\n7o f7 6\nthe V. mimicus CS30 genome. We found that retron‐Vmi1 was\ninserted into a gene encoding for a tRNA dihydrouridine synthase\nDusA (dusA gene). Interestingly, the retron ofV. parahaemolyticus\nAQ3354 (AB433983.1) is also inserted in a similar manner; how-\never, the composition of its operon is different. Retron‐Vmi1 resides\nin the chromosome with two integrase and helicase genes similar to\nretron‐Vpa1. Interestingly,attL and attR locations flanked by tRNA\ndihidrouridine synthase gene in retron‐Vpa1, and direct repeat are\nt h es a m ea sr e t r o n‐Vmi1. The sequence of the tRNA gene in vibrios\nis highly conserved, and the presence of horizontal gene transfer\nmobile elements betweenV. mimicusand V. choleraesuggests that\nretrons can be transferred via the tRNA gene. Many prophage\nDNAs and other related elements, such as integrative and con-\njugative elements (ICEs) use the tRNA gene as an insertion site\n[46]. This provides further evidence that the retron inVibrio may\nhave been acquired through a transduction event.\nWe then compared the retron‐Vmi1 environment with other\nbacterial strains having an RT with high homology to\nRT‐Vpa1 (Figure 10). We found that V. mimicus CS30,\nV. parahaemolyticusPHLUSAVBR00185 (AAXMTX000000000),\nand V. vulnificusV252 (NZ_LIIO01000008) have high homology\nnot only in the retron region but also in the neighboring two\nintegrases and DNA regulatory factors. Retron‐Vmi1 is inserted\nbetween the zur and dusA genes and the junction point was\nspeculated. This junction point contains a GAGGCAC sequence\nwhich is located upstream of themsr‐msd region. Surprisingly,\nwe foundV. anguillarum90‐11‐286 (CP011460), which lacks the\nretron region. Hence, the existence of another junction point\n(junction point 2) in the retron region was also speculated. This\nsecond junction point contains an ATGCTCGAT sequence,\nwhich was in the 5′ terminus of the dusA gene. Our results\nsuggested that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted into this site in a two‐\nstep manner.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by a Grant ‐in‐Aid for Scientific\nResearch to Tadashi S. from the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience (no. 18K07113, 21K07025).\nDisclosure\nThe authors have nothing to report.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nData Availability Statement\nData that support the findings of this study are available from the\ncorresponding author upon reasonable request.\nREFERENCES\n1.

In these technologies, a natural retron non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is modified to encode a template for the production of custom DNA \nsequences b y re v erse transcription. T he efficiency of re v erse transcription is a major limiting step for retron technologies, but we lack system- \natic knowledge of how to improve or maintain reverse transcription efficiency while changing the retron sequence for custom DNA production. \nHere, we test thousands of different modifications to the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA and measure DNA production in pooled variant library experi- \nments, identifying regions of the ncRNA that are tolerant and intolerant to modification. We apply this new information to a specific application: \nthe use of the retron to produce a precise genome editing donor in combination with a CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (an editron). We use \nhigh-throughput libraries in Saccharom y ces cere visiae to additionally define design rules for editrons. We extend our new knowledge of retron \nDNA production and editron design rules to human genome editing to achie v e the highest efficiency Retron-Eco1 editrons to date. \nGr aphical abstr act \nS. cerevisiae H. sapiensE. coli\nRetron\nncRNA\nmsDNA production\nEditing efficiency\nEditing \nncRNA\nValidation &\ndesign rules\nncRNAEndogenous retron system\n(phage defense only)\nEffector protein Reverse transcriptase\nIntroduction \nRetron components are increasingly being exploited for \nbiotechnology due to their ability to produce DNA on de- \nmand in cells. In bacteria, retrons are a tripartite anti-phage \nsystem composed of a reverse transcriptase (RT), a non-coding \nRNA (ncRNA) that is reverse transcribed into DNA (multi- \ncopy single-stranded DNA; msDNA) and an effector protein \n( 1 ,2 ). For Retron-Eco1 (used in this study), correct msDNA \nsynthesis, initiated at a conserved guanosine via a 2 ′ –5 ′ link- \nage, is crucial for phage defense ( 3 ,4 ) and results in filamen- \ntous sequestration of the toxic effector protein ( 5 ). A phage- \nencoded DNA cytosine methyltransferase triggers abortive in- \nfection by methylating the Retron-Eco1 reverse-transcribed \nDNA and results in nucleoside derivative depletion ( 6 ). The \neditron system uses only the RT and ncRNA from the retron \nas the effector protein is not necessary for reverse transcrip- \ntion. \nIn biotechnology, the retron RT is used to reverse transcribe \nmodified forms of retron ncRNA into reverse-transcribed \nDNA (RT-DNA), or msDNA that has been used as: donor \nDNA for precise editing in bacteria ( 7–12 ), bacteriophage \n( 13–15 ), plants ( 16 ,17 ) and eukaryotes ( 12 ,18–22 ); DNA bar- \ncodes to record molecular events ( 23 ,24 ); DNA containing \ntranscription factor motifs for transcription factor activity \nReceived: July 2, 2024.

Specif- \nically, modifications to the retron that generate more msDNA \nincrease the efficiency of precise editing and the efficiency of \nevent recording into a molecular ledger ( 19 , 23 , 25 ). These pre- \nvious works used the same modification to the retron ncRNA \nfor increased msDNA production—extension of the a1 / a2 \nregion. However, the retron ncRNA has not been systemat- \nically interrogated to determine which elements are necessary, \nwhich are tolerant to modifications, and where it may be pos- \nsible to increase reverse transcription beyond the endogenous \nelement. \nIn the context of precise genome editing technologies, there \nare additional parameters that have not been investigated \nsystematically. An editron, which combines retron compo- \nnents with CRISPR-Cas9 components to generate both a pro- \ngrammed double-strand break and the reverse-transcribed \ndonor to precisely repair it, has many degrees of freedom. \nThese include among others, how to arrange the donor and \nguide RNA (gRNA) relative to each other, where to situate the \nedit within the donor, or how long of a donor to use. Without \na set of clear design rules, users are left to either empirically \ntest many designs for their desired edit or pick an arbitrary \ndesign which may not perform optimally. \nTo rectify this lack of systematic investigation, we compre- \nhensively tested all parameters of the retron ncRNA for their \neffect on msDNA production in high throughput, used these \nfindings to build a machine learning model of msDNA pro- \nduction, and used the output of the model to inform high- \nthroughput tests of editing parameters in yeast. Finally, we \nextended these findings to human cells, resulting in a set of \ndesign rules for msDNA production and retron-based editing \nthat apply broadly. \nMaterials and methods \nBiological replicates were taken from distinct samples, not the \nsame sample measured repeatedly. For Esc heric hia coli variant \nlibraries, each biological replicate is an independent electropo- \nration and expression of the libraries into the strain bSLS.114. \nFor Saccharomyces cerevisiae variant libraries, each biolog- \nical replicate is an independent transformation and expres- \nsion of the variant libraries using a scaled-up version of the \nZymo Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit into the respec- \ntive yeast strains containing the editing site. For human valida- \ntion, each biological replicate is an independent transfection \nand expression of variants using Lipofectamine 3000 into a \nCas9-containing HEK293T cell line. \nAll statistical tests and P -values are included in \nSupplementary Table S1 . \nConstructs and strains \nA derivative of BL21-AI cells was used for all E. coli vari- \nant library experiments. This derivative, bSLS.114, has the \nendogenous Retron-Eco1 operon replaced by a chlorampheni- \ncol resistance cassette flanked by FRT recombinase sites using \nthe method developed by Datsenko and Wanner ( 28 ). This \nknock-out cassette was amplified from pKD3, adding homol- \nogy arms to the Retron-Eco1 locus with polymerase chain re- \naction (PCR) primers, and electroporated into BL21-AI cells \nwith the Lambda Red recombination machinery (pKD46). Af- \nter selecting clones on 10 μg / ml chloramphenicol plates, we \ngenotyped to confirm the locus-specific knock-out and then \nexcised the chloramphenicol resistance cassette using the FLP \nrecombinase (pMS127). \nAll yeast variant libraries were cloned into pKDC.100, \nwhich contains, under control of a Gal7 promoter, the 5 ′ end \nof the msr / msd and PaqCI Golden Gate restriction enzyme \nsites at the 3 ′ end of the msd for insertion of variant parts. This \nplasmid contains a URA3 selection marker and an episomal \norigin of replication (CEN / ARS), and was constructed using \nGibson assembly, with a Twist-synthesized gBlock containing \nthe PaqCI sites and a PCR-amplified linear pSCL039 19 . Yeast \nplasmids containing the three editing sites in the HIS3 site \nwere based off pZS.157 18 . These three variants (pSCL194: site \n1; pSCL195: site 2; and pSCL368: site 3) contain galactose- \ninducible Retron-Eco1 RT and Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 \n(Gal1-10 promoter) along with their respective sites. These \nplasmids were all constructed using Gibson assembly, us- \ning pZS.157 to create the backbone and Twist-synthesize \ngBlocks containing the editing sites. The strains containing \nthese editing sites along with Cas9 and Retron-Eco1 RT were \nmade using LiAc / SS carrier DNA / PEG transformation ( 29 ) of \nBY4742 ( 30 ). The respective plasmids were linearized using \nKpnI and transformed into BY4742 for homologous recom- \nbination into the HIS3 locus. Clones were selected on SD-HIS \nmedia. \nAll human vectors are derivatives of pSCL.273 12 , itself a \nderivative of pC AGGS. pC AGGS was modified by replacing \nthe MCS and rb_glob_polyA sequence with an IDT gblock \ncontaining inverted BbsI restriction sites and a SpCas9 trans- \nactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), using Gibson Assem- \nbly. The resulting plasmid, pSCL.273, contains an SV40 ori \nfor plasmid maintenance in HEK293T cells. The strong CAG \npromoter is followed by the BbsI sites and SpCas9 tracr- \nRNA. BbsI-mediated digestion of pSCL.273 yields a back- \nbone for single or library cloning of plasmids by Gibson As- \nsembly or Golden Gate cloning. Our backbone incorporated \nan EGFP-P2A and Eco1RT into pSCL.273. Twist-synthesized \ngBlocks encoding our various ncRNA donors were cloned \ninto this backbone (pKDC.154) via Golden Gate Reaction \nwith PaqCI. Plasmids were subsequently midiprepped accord- \ning to manufacturer instruction (QIAGEN 12143). Human \nexperiments were carried out in a HEK293T cell line which \nexpresses Cas9 from a Piggybac-integrated, TRE3G-driven, \ndoxycycline-inducible (1 μg / ml) cassette, which we have pre- \nviously described ( 19 ). \nAll strains / lines are listed in Supplementary Table S3 , and \nall plasmids in Supplementary Table S2 . \nVariant library cloning \nEsc heric hia coli variant cloning was done as previously de- \nscribed ( 19 ) using BsaI Type IIS restriction sites and Golden \nGate cloning. After high-efficiency cloning and electropora- \ntion, variant libraries were miniprepped for electroporation \ninto the experimental strain (bSLS.114, described above). All \nE. coli variant parts were synthesized by Agilent. \nAll S. cerevisiae variant parts were synthesized by Twist. \nThe variant part of the editron ncRNA was flanked by PaqCI \nType IIS restriction sites and specific primers to amplify out \nsublibraries from a larger synthesis run. Each variant part \nNucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 3 \nwas padded by random nucleotides to 250 bp on the 3 ′ \nend, and sublibraries were segregated by original variant part \nlength (gated to each sublibrary having < 10% variance in \nthe length) to avoid library bias with amplifying out subli- \nbraries by PCR. Variant sublibraries were then combined with \npKDC.100 in a Golden Gate reaction using PaqCI and the \nPaqCI activator (2:1 ratio), and T4 DNA ligase (NEB) to gen- \nerate cloned sublibraries at high efficiency after electropora- \ntion into a cloning strain (ECloni Elite 10G, Biosearch Tech- \nnologies). Sublibraries were then midiprepped and combined \nbased on the number of variant parts in the sublibrary and the \nDNA concentration to create a final pooled library with equal \ndistribution of variant parts (QIAGEN). \nVariant library expression and sequencing \nEsc heric hia coli variant libraries were grown overnight and \ndiluted 1:500 into expression media (arabinose and isopropyl \nbeta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, or IPTG, for the ncRNA, and \nerythromycin for the RT). At dilution, we also took a pre- \nexpression sample. We then grew the cells for 5 h shak- \ning at 37 ◦C. After expression, we took two samples: one \nfor variant plasmid quantification and the other for msDNA \nquantification. \nThe pre-expression and post-expression plasmid sam- \nples were mixed 1:1 with water and boiled at 95 ◦C \nfor 5 min, then plasmid variants were amplified using \nPCR primers Eco1_Variant_Plasmids_for_Sequencing_F and \nEco1_Variant_Plasmids_for_Sequencing_R. msd variant plas- \nmids were identified by their altered sequence without bar- \ncodes, while msr variant plasmids were identified by the \nmatched barcode in the msd on the plasmid amplicon. \nThe msDNA expression sample was prepared as pre- \nviously described ( 19 ). Briefly, DNA was purified us- \ning a modified miniprep protocol, treated with RNase \nA / T1 (New England Biolabs), and purified with single- \nstranded DNA (ssDNA) / RNA Clean & Concentrator \nkit from Zymo Research. After ssDNA isolation, we \neither amplified the DNA barcode with primers con- \ntaining Illumina adapters ( msr sublibraries msDNA \nsamples; primers: Eco1_msdloop_for_Sequencing_F and \nEco1_msdloop_for_Sequencing_R) or performed a non- \nsequence-biased sequencing preparation ( msd msDNA \nsublibraries). To amplify msDNA without prior knowledge \nof the sequence, we treated the sample with DBR1 (Origene), \nextended the 3 ′ end with dCTP with TdT. We used Klenow \nfragment (3 ′ → 5 ′ exo-) to create the second complementary \nstrand using a primer with six guanines and an Illumina \nadapter. After creating the second strand, we ligated an \nIllumina adapter to the 3 ′ end of the complementary strand \nusing T4 ligase. All products were indexed and sequenced \non the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed in \nSupplementary Table S4 . \nAll yeast variant libraries were transformed into their \nmatched strain using a 40 × scaled-up version of the Zymo \nFrozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit. After a recovery for \n1 h in Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose media (YPD) and an \novernight growth shaking at 30 ◦C in 2% raffinose SD-URA- \nHIS, a time = 0-h sample was taken and then yeast were pas- \nsaged to 0.2 OD into 50 ml 2% galactose SD-URA-HIS. Cells \nwere then grown for 24 h shaking at 30 ◦C, a time = 24-h \nsample was taken. The yeast were then passaged again to 0.2 \noptical density at 600 nm (OD600) in 50 ml 2% galactose SD- \nURA-HIS and grown for another 24 h shaking at 30 ◦C. After \na total of 48 h of editing, the yeast optical densities were mea- \nsured again and two aliquots of 500 million cells each were \ncollected for the time = 48-h plasmid and genome sample. \nYeast genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted as previously \ndescribed ( 19 ). Briefly, cells were lysed in 120 μl lysis buffer \n(100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid pH 8, 50 mM Tris–\nHCl pH 8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and boiled for 15 min \nat 100 ◦C. After cooling the lysate on ice, proteins were pre- \ncipitated by adding 60 μl of ice-cold 7.5 M ammonium ac- \netate and incubating at −20 ◦C for 10 min. The samples were \ncentrifuged at 17 000 × g for 15 min to pellet the protein, \nand the supernatant containing the gDNA was transferred \nto a new tube. The gDNA was precipitated in 1:1 ice-cold \nisopropanol at 4 ◦C for 15 min, and then washed twice with \n200 μl ice-cold 70% ethanol. The DNA pellet was dried at \n65 ◦C for 5–10 min to evaporate all ethanol, and resuspended \nin 40 μl water. Then, gDNA samples for deep-sequencing \nwere amplified using primers around the editing site con- \ntaining Illumina adapters. All products were indexed and se- \nquenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed \nin Supplementary Table S4 . \nYeast plasmid DNA was extracted as previously described \n( 31 ). The Zymo Yeast Miniprep Kit was scaled up to 500m \ncells. Briefly, we resuspended yeast in 1 ml digestion buffer and \n30 μl zymolyase, and digested the cell wall for 3 h shaking at \n900 r.p.m. at 37 ◦C. We then added 1 ml of solution II (lysis \nbuffer) to the tubes, split the sample across multiple microcen- \ntrifuge tubes and added 1:1 solution III (protein precipitation \nbuffer). We then spun down the tubes and sequentially added \nthe supernatant to the Zymo Yeast Miniprep spin column. Af- \nter reconsolidating the sample, we washed the spin column \nwith 550 μl wash buffer and eluted in 20 μl pre-warmed ultra- \npure nuclease-free H 2 O at 37 ◦C. \nTo prepare the plasmid samples for sequencing without the \ncreation of hybrid products, we amplified the plasmid bar- \ncodes using 50 ng of plasmid DNA and 16 cycles of am- \nplification, performing eight reactions in parallel per sam- \nple using primers containing the Illumina adapters. We then \npooled the PCRs for each sample and removed primer-dimers \nthrough size-selective bead clean-up. We then use 5 μl of \nthe cleaned-up plasmid DNA amplicons for indexing and se- \nquencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing primers are listed \nin Supplementary Table S4 . \nMachine learning submethods \nWe split the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA variants and the associated \nmsDNA production values into 2930 training sequences, 154 \nvalidation sequences and 342 test sequences. We then trained \na convolutional neural network using one-hot-encoded retron \nncRNA sequences as inputs and msDNA production as the \noutput. The model parameters that were optimized using Ray \nTune were number of layers, step size and number of dila- \ntions with a 3:1 train:validation scheme. The final model was \nmade of two computational blocks and a residual dilated \nconvolution block followed by a two-layer perceptron. All \nmodel code will be available on GitHub prior to peer-reviewed \npublication. \nHuman editing expression and analysis \nAll HEK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Ea- \ngle’s medium + GlutaMax supplement (Thermo Fisher \n4 Nucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 \nScientific 10566016) + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine \nserum (HI-FBS). The six-well cultures were transiently trans- \nfected with 7.32 μg of plasmid per well using Lipofec- \ntamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours \nafter transfection, doxycycline was refreshed and cultures \nwere passaged into T-25 flasks to be grown for an addi- \ntional 48 h. Three days after transfection, cells were collected \nfor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). DAPI dye was \nadded to stain for live / dead and cells were gaited on DAPI \nand GFP with untransfected cells used as a negative control \nfor background (BD FACSAria Fusion). \nHuman sample preparation \nTo prepare samples for sequencing, sorted cells were collected \nand gDNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit ac- \ncording to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted \nin 50 μl of ultra-pure, nuclease-free water. \nTwo microliter of the gDNA was used as template in 25- \nμl PCR reactions with primer pairs to amplify the locus of \ninterest which also contained adapters for Illumina sequenc- \ning preparation. Lastly, the amplicons were indexed, and se- \nquenced on an Illumina MiSeq / NextSeq instrument. \nmsDNA production quantification \nmsDNA production was quantified as previously described \n( 19 ). Briefly, custom Python software was used to extract the \nvariant counts from the plasmid and msDNA samples. We \nthen normalized raw counts to relative abundance (raw count \nover the total number of raw counts) and a variant’s ms- \nDNA relative abundance to the same variant’s plasmid relative \nabundance, using the average of the pre- and post-induction \nplasmid abundances to integrate the plasmid abundance over \nthe 5-h expression window . Finally , these relative abundances \nwere normalized to the Retron-Eco1 wild-type abundance, set \nat 100%. \nEditing rate quantification \nCustom software was built to quantify library-scale and indi- \nvidual validation editing rates in yeast and human cells. For \nyeast variant libraries, raw barcode counts were pulled from \nthe 48-h genome (editing site) samples, and the 0-, 24- and 48- \nh plasmid samples. The read counts from the plasmids were \nsummed across the three time samples to integrate the plasmid \nabundances over the editing window, and then each barcode \nread count was normalized against all barcode read counts in \nthat sample. The relative abundance of an editor’s barcode in \nthe genome was then divided by the relative abundance of an \neditor’s barcode in the integrated plasmid pool. \nFor human validation of individual variants, custom soft- \nware was used to assess the number of reads with the precise \nedit divided by the number of reads with the wild-type se- \nquence. All types of software used in the analysis of this paper \nare available on GitHub. \nResults \nmsDNA production in E. coli from Retron-Eco1 \nncRNA variant libraries \nThe Retron-Eco1 ncRNA is a highly structured RNA molecule \nwith characteristic stem-loops and double-stranded regions \nthat is partially reverse transcribed to generate abundant \nRT-DNA, or msDNA in cells (Figure 1 A). As previous work \nfound msDNA production was a limiting factor in using the \nretron as a template for precise editing in prokaryotes and \neukaryotes and as a DNA barcode for molecular record- \ning ( 12 , 19 , 23 ), we set out to systematically understand how \nvariations in ncRNA sequence and structure impact msDNA \nproduction in E. coli . We constructed a 3443 member li- \nbrary of ncRNA variants, changing both the msr (non-reverse- \ntranscribed region) and msd (reverse-transcribed region). This \nlibrary contained all single-nucleotide substitutions, scanning \ndeletions and insertions of varying sizes and variations on \nlength and complementary of stem-loops and all permutation \nof the three-nucleotide RT recognition motif in the P3 loop. \nFor variants with changes in the msr , we included a linked \nbarcode in the P4 loop of the msDNA to allow amplification \nof the barcode via PCR. In all msr sublibraries, we also in- \ncluded a pseudo-wild-type control for normalization which \nhad a linked barcode on the P4 loop to control for the effect \nof adding 10 nucleotides on msDNA production. The library \nwas constructed using Golden Gate cloning, transformed into \na B-strain E. coli bSLS.114 (BL21-AI /Delta1Retron-Eco1), and ex- \npressed along with the Retron-Eco1 RT for 5 h, after which \nwe collected msDNA for quantification. All variant sequences \nare included in Supplementary Tables S9 –S18 . \nTo quantify the msDNA abundance of msd variants, we \nused a sequencing pipeline described previously that allows us \nto amplify msDNA without requiring prior knowledge of the \nmsDNA sequence ( 4 , 12 , 19 ). Briefly, we (i) purified short ss- \nDNA using a QIAGEN Midiprep Plasmid Plus Kit followed by \na Zymo ssDNA Clean & Concentrator Kit, (ii) treated the re- \nsulting ssDNA with Dbr1 to remove the 2 ′ –5 ′ linkage between \nthe msDNA and ncRNA, (iii) extended the debranched ss- \nDNA with a single polynucleotide using template-independent \npolymerase (TdT), (iv) generated a complementary strand us- \ning a primer consisting of the complementary single polynu- \ncleotide and an Illumina adaptor, (v) ligated an adaptor to the \nother end of the now double-stranded msDNA and lastly (vi) \nIllumina sequenced the now double-stranded msDNA with Il- \nlumina adaptors on both ends. msDNA barcodes linked to \nchanges in the msr were quantified by amplifying the barcode \nfor sequencing after purifying ssDNA. All variants were nor- \nmalized against the production of the wild-type retron-derived \nmsDNA and the abundance of the variant plasmid (Figure \n1 B). To quantify the relative abundance of each variant plas- \nmid in the expression cells, we amplified the variable region \nof the ncRNA using plasmid-specific primers and sequenced \nthe amplicons using Illumina sequencing. \nFigure 1 C shows single-nucleotide substitutions scanning \nacross the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA, where we found substantial \nsequence flexibility on the single-nucleotide level except at \ntwo important positions: around the priming guanosine im- \nmediately after the a1 region, previously shown to be impor- \ntant for making the 2 ′ –5 ′ linkage of ncRNA-to-msDNA ( 32 ); \nand around the previously known UUU putative recognition \nloop for the Retron-Eco1 RT ( 33 ) (Figure 1 C; Supplementary \nFigure S1 b–e). \nWe also analyzed deletions scanning across the Retron- \nEco1 ncRNA that varied in length from one to five nu- \ncleotides. The Retron-Eco1 ncRNA is less tolerant to dele- \ntions than substitutions, particularly in the msr P2 and P3 \nstem loops, suggesting a greater influence of structure over se- \nquence. In addition, deletions in the msd region directly flank- \ning the a2 region were not tolerated. Larger deletions are less \nNucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 5 \nDistance from stem base of P4\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\nA\na1\na2\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nDistance from stem base of P2\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\nDistance from stem base of P3\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\nhairpin broken\nhairpin fixed\nhairpin broken\nhairpin fixed\nhairpin broken\nhairpin fixed\nGHI\nEco1\nncRNA\n220 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\n+5+1 +3\na1 a2E\nncRNA position\ninsertions\nncRNA position\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nRT-DNAa1 a2\nbase swapinsertion deletion\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\nF\n2 4 6 8\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1 2 3 4 5\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n-5-3 -4-2-1\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\na1 a2D\nncRNA position\ndeletions\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n->T->C ->G->A\na1 a2\nmsDNA abundance \n(% of wt)\nC\nncRNA position\nswaps\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n5 10 15 20\n10\n100\nU U U\nPosition 123\nEco1\nncRNA\nA C G U A C G U A C G U A C G U\nA\nC\nG\nU\nA C G U\nPosition 1\nPosition 2\nPosition 3\n0\n20\n40\n60\nStandard Deviation\nmsDNA Production\n(% of wt)\nB\nJK\nP3\nmsDNA\nSequencing Prep\nIndirect Readout\nDirect Readout\nmsr/msd\nvar.\nlinked barcode\nvar.\nmsr/msd\nmsr var.\nmsd var.\nvariant parts\n50\n100\n150\nmsr\nmsd\nFigure 1. msDNA production of Retron-Eco1 variant libraries in E. coli .

Each square represents \nthe mean of three biological replicates.

While \nsmall insertions were slightly more tolerated than small dele- \ntions ( Supplementary Figure S1 g, k and l), larger insertions \nin the msr region resulted in undetectable levels of msDNA \n( Supplementary Figure S1 m). Similarly to deletions, insertions \ndirectly adjacent to the a2 region in msd also greatly reduced \nmsDNA production. \nA summary of the effect of all nucleotide substitutions, \ndeletions and insertions is shown in Figure 1 F. Generally, the \nRetron-Eco1 ncRNA tolerates modifications in the P2 and \nP4 stem-loops, but is relatively intolerant to modifications \naround the priming guanosine and the stem-loop P3. The tol- \nerance to mutations in the P4 stem is important for the use \nof Retron-Eco1 in biotechnology, as this is the position where \nediting donors and DNA barcodes have been encoded. \nNext, we sought to assess the effect of structural variations. \nTo do this, we quantified the effect of breaking complemen- \ntarity in stem-loops P2, P3 and P4 by replacing one side of \nthe stem with a non-complementary new sequence to create a \nnucleotide bubble of length 4 in stem-loops P2 and P3, and \nlength 5 in stem-loop P4. To control for an effect of a se- \nquence versus structural change, we also restored complemen- \ntarity by changing the same position on the other side of the \nstem with the complement of the replaced nucleotides. Break- \ning P4 complementarity only affected msDNA production at \nthe base and the tip of the stem, and fixing complementar- \nity with different sequences restored wild-type levels of ms- \nDNA production (Figure 1 G). Breaking stem-loop P2 com- \nplementarity closer to the base reduced msDNA production \nand restoring complementarity restored msDNA production \n(Figure 1 H). Breaking stem-loop P3 complementarity reduces \nmsDNA production, but restoring complementarity with an \nalternate sequence does not restore msDNA production (Fig- \nure 1 I). Overall, there are clear structural requirements, most \nnotably in P2 / 3: in P2, structure is important; and in P3, both \nsequence and structure are important for msDNA production. \nWe next sought to quantify how strictly required the UUU \nrecognition motif in the loop of P3 is for RT recognition \n(Figure 1 J). Testing every permutation of the UUU motif re- \nveals low sequence flexibility in position 3 (vertical axis) \nand position 2 (bottom axis), requiring both of these to be \nuracils. However, there is significant flexibility in position 1, \nwith every possible base approaching wild-type msDNA pro- \nduction levels (lower right square, UUU), with GUU hav- \ning higher msDNA production than wild-type (Figure 1 K; \nSupplementary Figure S2 ). \nMachine learning on libraries reveals novel \nvariables to increase msDNA production \nThough we tested ∼3400 variants of the Retron-Eco1 ncRNA \nincluding all single-nucleotide substitutions, a variant library \nof all possible nucleotide combinations would number on the \norder of 10 90 variants, without including insertions and dele- \ntions. Therefore, to explore more of the possible sequence \nspace, we used the ncRNA variant library data to create a ma- \nchine learning algorithm capable of predicting novel retron \nncRNA sequences with enhanced msDNA production. The \nexperimental values across ∼3400 measurements were inverse \nnormal transformed and split into a train, validation and test \nsets. A convolutional neural network, named retDNN, was \nthen used to learn the relationship between sequence and ms- \nDNA levels. The retDNN model comprises of two compu- \ntational blocks and a residual dilated convolution block fol- \nlowed by a two-layer perceptron. The model was trained on \n3084 measurements and tested on the held-out set, achieving \nan R = 0.671 performance ( R = 0.775 on the training set) \n(Figure 2 A and B). We then queried the retDNN model with \nin silico variants, including a P4 stem-loop of varying GC con- \ntent. Interestingly, the model predicted that lowering GC con- \ntent in the P4 stem-loop would increase msDNA production \nover wild-type, something untested in the original variant li- \nbrary. To validate this prediction, we synthesized and cloned \nthe 500 queried variants of differing GC contents (25 variants \nper 10% GC content range) and experimentally validated ms- \nDNA production relative to wild-type through the same se- \nquencing pipeline as above. As the algorithm predicted, lower \nGC percentages of the P4 stem-loop produced more msDNA \n(Figure 2 C). \nEditing performance in S. cerevisiae of Retron-Eco1 \nncRNA variant libraries \nEfficient msDNA production is critical for retron biotech- \nnology, including the use of msDNA as the donor for pre- \ncise genome editing. In this context, a Retron-Eco1 ncRNA \nis modified to encode a precise repair donor in the stem-loop \nof P4 and a gRNA for Cas9 double-strand DNA cleavage at \nthe 3 ′ end of the ncRNA. This combination of CRISPR-Cas9 \nand retron immune systems has been called CRISPEY in yeast \n( 18 ) or as an editron ( 12 ) to encompass its use in all eukary- \notic cells. After determining the effect of ncRNA variations \non msDNA production in E. coli , we sought to extend this un- \nderstanding to editing and additionally investigate how donor, \ngRNA and ncRNA chassis variants all together affect precise \nediting rates in eukaryotes. \nWe designed a library to assess the contributions of struc- \ntural, cut site and donor variables to precise genome editing \nby encoding unique donors in the P4 loop of the ncRNA, with \neach donor variant inserting a unique 10-bp barcode into the \nyeast genome at a designated site, along with changing the \nNGG S. pyogenes Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to \nNAT to prevent re-targeting of the edited site. We synthesized \nvariant libraries for the same variables across three unique \nsites: two artificial, constructed sites with designed, symmet- \nric PAMs around the edit site, and one site from the human \ngenome (an intron in the NPAS2 gene) with the same PAM \nlocations as the constructed sites. These three sites were in- \ndependently integrated into the HIS locus of S. cerevisiae to \ninterrogate the local sequence effects on the editing efficiency, \nwhile ensuring the editing site remains active and open by also \nproviding a copy of the HIS gene in HIS auxotrophic yeast, \nand maintaining strains in HIS media. \nIn these variant libraries, we assessed: five donor lengths \n(54, 64, 78, 94 and 112 nucleotides), five homology arm sym- \nmetries about the edit site per donor length, msDNA donors \nthat are complementary to the target or non-target strand and \nfive different cut sites ( −16, −8, 0, +8 and +16 relative to \nbarcode insertion point), leading to 175 donor / gRNA com- \nbinations per site (Figure 3 A). We then combinatorially com- \nbined these donor / gRNA variants with 25 different ncRNA \nchassis: wild-type Eco1 ncRNA, CRISPEY ncRNA ( 18 ), the \n13 best-performing structural variants from the E. coli \nNucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 7 \nTest SetA B CTraining Set\n−2 0 2\n−2\n0\n2\nPredicted activity\nR=0.775\nP<0.0001\n−2 −1 0 1 2\nObserved activity\nlog10(msDNA production norm. to wt)\n−1\n0\n1\nPredicted activity\nR=0.671\nP<0.0001\nObserved activity\nlog10(msDNA production norm. to wt)\nObserved activity (% of wt)\n101\n102\n103\n-1\n1\n0\nPredicted activity (INT)\npredicted\nobserved\n0-1010-2020-3030-4040-5050-6060-7070-8080-9090-100P4 Stem GC %\nFigure 2.

In all, we tested 4275 variants \nper site. All variant sequences are included in Supplementary \nTables S6 –S8 . \nThree independent yeast lines were created, each with one \nof the three sites in the HIS locus of the yeast genome \nalong with Cas9 and Retron-Eco1 RT under the control of \na GAL1 / 10 galactose-inducible divergent promoter (Figure \n3 B). These synthesized ncRNA variants for each site were en- \ncoded on a vector containing other necessary ncRNA com- \nponents (ribozymes, tracrRNA) under the GAL7 galactose- \ninducible promoter (Figure 3 C). After transformation of the \nediting libraries into yeast, editing was performed for 48 h in \ngalactose media. \nTo analyze the data, we sequenced the barcode distribution \nin the plasmid pool and the barcodes inserted into the cor- \nrect site in the yeast genome after 48 h of editing. First, we \ncalculated the proportion of each barcode’s reads in the pool \nof reads (for barcodes edited into the genome: the reads at \n48 h of editing; for barcodes in the plasmid pool: the reads \nas summed over samples taken at 0, 24 and 48 h of edit- \ning). This is to integrate the plasmid barcode pool over the \nentire editing period. Plasmid barcode read count was stable \nover the 48 h of editing ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Then, we \nnormalized the individual barcode proportions as seen in the \ngenome to the same barcode’s proportion as seen in the plas- \nmid pool (called barcode representation henceforth), and re- \nmoved barcodes not seen at counts > 10 in the plasmid pool or \nnot seen at all in the genome pool (percent of working editors \nper library variable is shown in the Supplementary Figure S4 ). \nWe then normalized along the axis of interest. For example, \nwhen assessing the effect of donor msDNA complementary to \neither the target or non-target strand (target strand: strand \ncomplementary to the gRNA / complementary to the PAM- \ncontaining strand; non-target strand: strand not complemen- \ntary to gRNA / PAM-containing strand), we held all other vari- \nables constant (donor length, cut site, donor center and chas- \nsis) and normalized the target strand barcode representation \nto the non-target strand barcode representation of each spe- \ncific group. This normalized barcode representation for ev- \nery barcode for each biological replicate for each site is rep- \nresented as a transparent circle in Figure 3 D. We then took \nthe median of each biological replicate of each site, based on \nthe distribution on the right of Figure 3 D, and averaged those \nacross all sites to obtain the summary figure for that axis of \ninterest. After performing this normalization, we found that, \non average, target strand donors are worse editors than non- \ntarget strand donors because the barcode was inserted less \noften when holding all other variables constant, performing \nat about 50% efficiency as compared with the matched non- \ntarget strand donors (Figure 3 E). Both target strand and non- \ntarget strand donors have about 50% functional editor vari- \nants, as other parameters also influence if an editor is func- \ntional ( Supplementary Figure S4 a). When examining whether \ncut position relative to edit affects strand polarity preferences, \nwe find that donors complementary to the non-target strand \nperform worse or equal to donors complementary to the tar- \nget strand, regardless of whether the cut is positioned on the \n5 ′ or 3 ′ side of the edit ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). \nWe analyzed the effect of cut site positioning relative to in- \nsertion point by using Cas9 spacer sequences eight nucleotides \napart and analyzing as above, normalizing within-group to a \ncut position of 0, the site at which Cas9 cuts directly where \nthe 10-bp barcode is then inserted. We noticed that the cut \nsite of −8 for site 2 had an unusually low number of working \ndonors ( < 20%), which was not observed when using other \ngRNAs at site 2 or with the −8 position at sites 1 and 3 \n( Supplementary Figure S4 b). Given that we intend to quan- \ntify the effect of editron parameters and not local sequence \naround the gRNA, we excluded editrons with the −8 gRNA \nat site 2 from analysis. At site 1 and 3, we found that an edit \non the PAM-proximal side of the cut site performed slightly \nbetter ( ∼130% efficiency at the cut site of −8 compared with \na cut position of 0) and performed much better than an edit \non the PAM-distal side of the cut site ( ∼65% efficiency at the \ncut site of +8), with consistency across sites, while cut sites far \n8 Nucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 \n3 sites\nncRNA chassis\nx25/site\nribozymes\ntracrRNA\n4,275 synthesized variants \nper site\nncRNA\ndonor\nbarcode\nsynthesis adapters\ngRNA\nAB C\nTotal donors:\n35/site\nx5 gRNAs\nbarcode insertion point\n5 lengths5 lengths\nNon-target strand\nTarget strand\nNon-target strand\nTarget strand\n5 centers5 centers\nDonor complementarity:\nRNA space\nED\nNon-target strand Target strand\nDonor complementarity\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\nsite\n1\n2\n3\nNon-target strand Target strand\nDonor complementarity\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nTarget strand donor distributions\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\nF\n-25 -15 -5 +9 +23\nDonor center relative to insertion point (nt)\n-16\n-8\n0\n+8\n+16\nCut site relative to insertion point (bp)\n94 nt donor length\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\n-16 -8 0 +8 +16\nCut site relative to\n insertion point (bp)\n1.0\n2.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\n54 64 78 94 112\nDonor length (nt)\n100\n10-1\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\nG H\nI\nNormalized barcode representation\n(only functional editors)\n2.0\n1.0\n0.8\nwt\nStructure: \nP1 length (bp)\nDeletions \n(ncRNA position)\nSubstitutions Machine learningStructure: \nP4 length (bp)\nCRISPEY\na1\na2\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nEco1\nncRNA\n27 23 1916 8 10 12 14 136 139 141\nC144T\nT147A\n1234567891 0\nPAM-distal PAM-proximal\nDonor shifted PAM-distal Donor shifted PAM-proximal\nFigure 3.

However, it should \nbe noted that only donors complementary to the non-target \nstrand were included in this part of the editron library. \nWe examined the effect of donor length, normalizing \nwithin-group to a donor length of 94 nucleotides. In general, \nlonger donors were more efficient editors than shorter donors, \nwith a 54 nucleotide donor editing at ∼10% of the rate of to \nthe 94 nucleotide donors, while 112 nucleotide had ∼130% \nefficiency compared with the 94 nucleotide donor (Figure 3 G). \nThe percentage of working donors per donor length also in- \ncreased with donor length ( Supplementary Figure S4 c). \nWe assessed the effect of donor center and cut site together \nby first fixing the donor length (so each donor length is sep- \narately analyzed) and then normalizing within-group to the \ncentered cut site (0) and centered donor (–5). The data for \n94 nucleotide donor length is shown, as each different donor \nlength has different donor center points. All other donor \nlength results are shown in Supplementary Figure S6 . As the \nhigher normalized barcode representation goes from top left \nto bottom right for the 94 nucleotide donor, it was generally \nbetter to center the donor around the cut site than the inser- \ntion point, except for cases of cut sites very far from insertion \npoint (top left and bottom right). In addition, for 94 nucleotide \ndonors, when cut and insertion points were overlapping, a \nslightly PAM-proximal shifted donor performed slightly bet- \nter than centered, at 110% efficiency compared with centered \n(Figure 3 H). We observed similar but not identical results at \nother donor lengths ( Supplementary Figure S6 ), potentially \nbecause symmetry requirements shift as donor length changes \nor due to outliers in those donor lengths. The percentage of \nworking donors for donor center and cut site is included in \nSupplementary Figure S7 . \nFinally, we analyzed the effect of ncRNA chassis, normaliz- \ning within-group to the original CRISPEY chassis. In general, \nno structural variants performed worse than the CRISPEY \nchassis, and several variants performed significantly better (27 \nbp a1 / a2 extension, 10 and 12 bp P4 stem length, deletion at \nposition 139, C144T and T147A and machine learning (ML) \nchassis 8 and 9) (Figure 3 I). Excitingly, we found that the ma- \nchine learning-predicted chassis supported equally high rates \nof editing despite deviating from the natural sequence by 55–\n80% in the 20 nucleotide ML variable region, or up to 12% \nover the full Retron-Eco1 ncRNA including the 27-bp ex- \ntended a1 / a2 (logo map of ribonucleotide usage across the \nmachine learning variable region in Supplementary Figure S9 ). \nSpecific machine learning chassis structures and sequences can \nbe found in Supplementary Figure S8 . We found no evidence \nof a difference in the percentage of working donors across \nncRNA chassis ( Supplementary Figure S10 ). \nLibrary-informed optimization of human editing \nWe next sought to understand if design rules learned in E. coli \nand S. cerevisiae extend to editing in human cells. Editrons \ncontain the same constituent parts in human cells as in yeast, \nexcept for the editing ncRNA is driven by an H1 promoter for \nnuclear retention rather than being flanked by ribozymes. Our \nplasmids included an EGFP and Retron-Eco1 RT separated by \na P2A driven by a CAG constitutive promoter and a ncRNA \ncontaining an editing donor fused to a single-guide RNA \n(sgRNA) driven by a Pol III H1 promoter. The addition of the \nEGFP enables selection of cells successfully transfected with \nat least one copy of the editing plasmid. The editing donors \nconsist of a sequence homologous to the desired editing site \nin the genome but including a PAM recode (NGG > NAT), \nand a single nucleotide change. We chose to target an intron \nin the endogenous NPAS2 site for human validation, using the \nexact ncRNA constructs used in the yeast libraries. All donors \ntested are included in Supplementary Table S5 . \nThe editron plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells \ncontaining an integrated doxycycline-inducible Cas9, whose \nexpression was induced 24 h before transfection. Cells were \ncollected 3 days after transfection and sorted via FACS to only \ninclude live and transfected cells, eliminating any variability \nto due transfection efficiency (Figure 4 A). We used gRNA 5 \nfor human validation, after an initial screen for gRNA effi- \ncacy showed it to have the highest rates of insertions / deletions \n(indels) of the three tested gRNAs, indicating highest cutting \nefficiency (Figure 4 B). Consistent with our earlier findings in \nyeast, we demonstrated that a longer donor and a donor ho- \nmologous to the non-target strand improve editing efficiency \n(Figure 4 C and D). A 112 nucleotide donor increased precise \nediting from ∼5 to ∼12%, while a non-target strand homol- \nogous donor increased editing from ∼4 to ∼12%. \nWe chose to validate three chassis modifications in human \ncells. Longer a1 / 2 length increased editing compared with \nwild-type a1 / a2 length. Excitingly, ML modifications enabled \nsuccessful editing despite only 30% sequence similarity to \nwild-type, demonstrating the flexibility of the region (Figure \n4 E). Next, we sought to determine the ideal positioning of \nboth the edit and the donor relative to a set cut site. We tested \nthree edits: a middle edit at the cut site, an edit 20 bp upstream \nof the cut site, and an edit 20 bp downstream of the cut site. \nFor each of these edits, we tested a donor which was non- \nsymmetric about the edit with more homology on the 5 ′ side of \nthe non-target strand, centered on the edit, or non-symmetric \nabout the edit with more homology to the 3 ′ side of the edit \nsite on the non-target strand (Figure 4 F). All donors used were \ncomplementary to the non-target strand. We found that plac- \ning an edit at the cut site and on the PAM-proximal side both \nallowed successful editing, with a slight trend favoring the \ncentral cut. Additionally, the trend shows that a donor cen- \ntered on the cut or with more homology on the PAM-proximal \nside donor both enable editing. None of the conditions with \nthe edit on the PAM-distal side were edited successfully \n(Figure 4 G). \nBased on all our variant testing, we provide a set of gen- \neralizable design principles for creating future editrons for \nnew targets. Testing several gRNAs to achieve optimal cut- \nting efficiency is an important first step based on our findings \nshowing the variability in indel rates among guides. Donors \nshould be parallel to the guide and complementary to the non- \ntarget strand as msDNA, with a 112 nucleotide donor having \nthe highest precise editing rate. Additionally, the cut should \nbe centered or non-symmetrically shifted toward the PAM- \nproximal side of the non-target strand. When modifying the \nncRNA, the a1 / 2 should be extended at least to 23bp. We also \ndemonstrate flexibility in the 3 ′ region and the P4 length of the \nncRNA, allowing for modifications as needed (Figure. 4 H). \nDiscussion \nIn this work, we comprehensively evaluated the effect of \nncRNA variations on msDNA production in bacteria from \nwhich we trained and validated a ML model.

Validating yeast editing libraries with individual human variants. ( A ) Human editing schematic. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid \ncontaining the editing ncRNA variant with a single nucleotide transversion as a precise edit, along with recoding the PAM NGG to NAT. The plasmid also \ncontained a constitutively driven GFP-P2A-Eco1 RT. The editron targeted an intronic region of the NPAS2 gene on Chromosome 2 (‘site 3’ in the yeast \ndata in Figure 3 ). The HEK293T line also had semi-randomly integrated S. p y ogenes Cas9 b y PiggyB ac transposase under a dox-inducible promoter and a \nC-terminal NLS. Se v enty -tw o hours after transfection, the HEK293T cells were sorted as GFP+ / DAPI − (alive transfected cells) and their genomes were \nsequenced for precise edits.

All gRNA indel rates are \nstatistically different from one another (one-w a y ANO V A, P < 0.0 0 01; B onferroni post hoc test sho w ed P < 0.05 f or all comparisons). ( C ) P recise editing \npercentages of 52 nucleotide and 112 nucleotide long donors. Individual biological replicates are open circles. The 112 nucleotide donor is a significantly \nmore efficient editor (paired t -test, P = 0.025). ( D ) Precise editing percentages of target and non-target strand homologous donors. Individual biological \nreplicates are open circles. Non-target strand homologous donors are significantly more efficient editors (paired t -test, P = 0.043). ( E ) Precise editing \npercentages of four ncRNA chassis: wild-type Eco1 ncRNA, extended P1 (a1 / a2) (23 and 27 bp) and machine learning chassis 9. Individual biological \nreplicates are open circles. There is a significant effect of ncRNA chassis (one-way ANO V A, P = 0.01), with a1 / a2 extensions of 23 ( P = 0.0267) and 27 \nbp ( P = 0.0046) performing significantly better than wild-type and ML chassis 9 not performing worse than wild-type ( P = 0.0993) (Dunnett’s corrected). \n( F ) Schematic of donor center relative to precise edit site and cut site. Three precise edits were spaced 20-bp apart, with the cut site centered on the \nmiddle edit. Three different donor positions were used per edit: 5 ′ -sided, centered and 3 ′ -sided. ( G ) Precise editing percentages of the nine different \ndonor center / edit combinations. Three datapoints in the central cut / centered donor are repeated from (D), as these replicates served as the controls for \nboth the donor center / cut site experiment and the target strand experiment. There is a significant effect of edit site and donor symmetry (one-way \nANO V A, P = 0.0 0 02), with all edits on the PAM-distal side of the cut ( P = 0.0014 for 5 ′ donor center, P = 0.0012 for centered donor and P = 0.0016 for 3 ′ \ncentered donor) and the 3 ′ donor center on the PAM-proximal side ( P = 0.0 0 09) performing significantly worse than a central cut and edit (Dunnett’s \ncorrected). ( H ) Schematic illustrating final recommendations for editron design. \nNucleic Acids Research , 2025, Vol. 53, No. 2 11 \nevaluated the effect of variations in donor and gRNA, along \nwith ncRNA structure, on editing efficiency in yeast; and val- \nidated the major findings in human cells. From these variant \nlibraries, we found that the msd region of the ncRNA is gen- \nerally tolerant to alterations, specifically the stem-loop P4, in \nwhich programmable sequences for biotechnology can be in- \nserted, like a donor sequence for precise editing or a transcrip- \ntion factor motif for attenuating transcription factor activity. \nWe also characterized regions of the msr that are required \nfor efficient reverse transcription, such as testing every per- \nmutation of the RT recognition motif in stem-loop P3 where \nthe Retron-Eco1 RT initiates reverse transcription ( 33 ) and \nthe UAGC sequence which includes the priming guanosine \n( 33 ). In terms of editing parameters, we found higher rates \nof editing by increasing donor and a1 / a2 length, and using \na centered or slightly asymmetric donor with more homol- \nogy on the PAM-proximal side of the non-target strand. We \nalso demonstrated significant flexibility in the 3 ′ side of the \nmsd sequence for editing, which we altered with targeted dele- \ntions, single-nucleotide changes, and stem length alterations. \nWe also changed the 3 ′ side of the msd region to machine \nlearning predicted de novo variants of 55–80% difference \nfrom the wild-type sequence in the 20 nucleotide ML variable \nregion, or up to 12% over the full Retron-Eco1 ncRNA. \nEditrons are conceptually similar to another precise edit- \ning approach called prime editing, which uses a nickase Cas9 \nfused to a promiscuous RT and a gRNA fused to a short donor. \nThe RT extends from the nick using the donor to introduce a \nprecise modification after flap excision and heteroduplex res- \nolution ( 34 ). Editrons use prokaryotic, retron RTs, in contrast \nto the mammalian, viral, MMLV RT most typically used in \nprime editors. Retron RTs are smaller than MML V RT , which \ncan be advantageous for delivering parts to cells using plas- \nmids or viruses, and are more processive than MML V RT , \nwhich has enabled much longer insertions ( 18 ) than are possi- \nble without adding additional proteins, such as Bxb1 recombi- \nnase and a recombination donor ( 35 ) to prime editing. While \nprime editing has been extensively optimized, work like this \nstudy is necessary to realize the full potential of editrons. \nOur variant libraries agree with previous optimizations \nwith single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) in some as- \npects, and disagree in others. For example, previous work \non ssODNs has found that ssODNs of 70–80 nucleotides \nhave the highest rate of precise repair, and precise repair \nrates decline above 80 nucleotides ( 36 ,37 ). This is contrary \nto our finding that precise editing rates increase with increas- \ning length of the msDNA past the previously found optimal \nlength of ssODNs. This difference could be due to lower DNA \ntransfection of longer oligonucleotides or due to the difficulty \nof synthesizing longer oligonucleotides ( 36 ). As our donor \nis created inside the nucleus of the cell by the Retron-Eco1 \nRT, our precise editing method will not be limited by syn- \nthesis or transfection limitations. We note that, eventually, \nthe Retron-Eco1 RT processivity may hinder production of a \nlonger donor, but that we do not believe we have reached that \nlimit in this work, or that any processivity losses are offset by \nprecise repair gains. \nPrior optimization work of ssODN donors has also found \nthat donors asymmetric about the cut site on the non-target \nstrand have better precise editing outcomes, agreeing with our \nresults ( 9 , 37 , 38 ). After cleavage, Cas9 releases the non-target \nstrand, after which a 3 ′ –to–5 ′ exonuclease, like Klenow, de- \ngrades the 3 ′ flap ( 39 ). Therefore, homology should be biased \nand asymmetric towards the PAM-proximal side of the non- \ntarget strand, as this strand is both free and non-degraded. \nWe only evaluated asymmetry in a donor homologous to \nthe non-target strand in this study. This is because, in both \nyeast and human, across different cut sites, we find donors \nhomologous to the non-target strand result in higher precise \nediting than the target strand, as fits with the mechanism of \nCas9 above and to some ssODN studies ( 36 ). This is contrary \nto other ssODN studies, which find that strand polarity pref- \nerence depends on cut position relative to the edit ( 40 ). How- \never, because our editor is a ncRNA reverse-transcribed into \na donor, we have the additional complexity of RNA:RNA hy- \nbridization. When the reverse-transcribed donor is homolo- \ngous to the target strand, the gRNA would be homologous \nto the donor before reverse transcription and could cause the \ngRNA to be ‘hidden’ from Cas9 through base pairing with \nthe ncRNA donor. This is an additional complexity not eval- \nuated in optimizing ssODNs, and may increase the effect we \nobserve, with non-target strand complementarity of the donor \nperforming better than target strand complementarity and be \nthe reason some ssODN studies find locus-dependence for \nstrand preference, while we do not, though more loci will need \nto be tested before fully making this claim ( 37 ). \nOur first variant library in E. coli was aimed at understand- \ning parameters in the retron ncRNA that influence msDNA \nproduction. In contrast, our editron variant library used edit- \ning as the output, consistent with our goal of identifying pa- \nrameters that influence editing. It is possible that some editing \ngains were due to increased msDNA production while oth- \ners were due to the creation of more favorable donor–target- \ngRNA interactions. It is likely that the final optimized parts \nstrike a balance between gains in msDNA production and \ngains from having ideal editing components. Ultimately, our \nhigh-throughput approach to testing thousands of variants \nenabled us to sample a wide space, including potential com- \npromises between the multiple parameters influencing editing, \nwhich would have been impossible with traditional experi- \nments testing one parameter at a time. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of us- \ning variant libraries to train a ML library that we can query \nwith de novo retron ncRNA sequences to assess their possi- \nble msDNA production. This high-throughput computational \napproach allowed us to screen many more sequences in sil- \nico than currently possible experimentally. Through this, we \nqueried and validated new aspects of the ncRNA that can in- \ncrease msDNA production, and thus editing. Importantly, we \nwere able to use the output of the ML model to make semi- \nsynthetic ncRNAs that are as functional as wild-type. \nData availability \nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available \nwithin the article and its supplementary information, or will \nbe made available from the authors upon request.

The emergence of strains with multiple resistance mechanisms\nfurther complicates the management of these infections.\nMethods: We isolated and characterized a novel ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain from\na pediatric bone marrow transplantation patient. Antimicrobial susceptibility\ntesting was performed to determine resistance patterns. Comprehensive\ngenomic analysis was conducted to identify plasmid types, virulence factors,\nand antimicrobial resistance genes, as well as potential resistance mechanisms\nassociated with mutations and plasmid-mediated variants.\nResults: The isolated hv-CRKP strain exhibited multidrug resistance to\ncarbapenem, tigecycline, and polymyxin. Genomic analysis revealed that the\nIncHI1B/repB plasmid carried virulence factors (rmpA, ΔrmpA2, iucABCD, iutA),\nwhile IncFII/IncR and IncFII plasmids harbored resistance genes [bla\nCTX-M-65,\nblaTEM-1B, rmtB, blaSHV-12, blaKPC-2, qnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet(A), tet(R)].\nThe coexistence of blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-12, blaLAP-2, and blaKPC-2 in\none hv-CRKP strain is exceptionally rare. Additionally, the Tet(A)-S251A variant\nin the conjugative plasmid pTET-4 may confer tigecycline resistance.\nMutations in MgrB, PhoPQ, and PmrABCDK were identi ﬁed as potential\ncontributors to increased polymyxin resistance. Interestingly, plasmid-encoded\nrestriction-modiﬁcation systems and Retron regions were identi ﬁed, which\ncould potentially confer phage resistance.\nDiscussion: The combination of virulence and antimicrobial resistance factors in\nthe ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain represents a signiﬁcant challenge for treating\nimmunocompromised pediatric patients. Particularly concerning is the\nresistance to polymyxin and tigecycline, which are often last-resort treatments\nfor multidrug-resistant infections. The ﬁndings highlight the urgent need for\neffective surveillance, infection control measures, and novel therapeutic\nstrategies to manage such hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant pathogens.\nKEYWORDS\nhv-CRKP, polymyxin, tigecycline, carbapenem, BMT\nTYPE Original Research\nPUBLISHED 06 January 2025\n| DOI 10.3389/fped.2024.1450201\nFrontiers inPediatrics 01 frontiersin.org\nIntroduction\nThe prevalence of carbapenem-resistantK. pneumonia (CRKP)\ninfection poses a signiﬁcant and enduring obstacle to worldwide\npublic health systems (1– 3). The emergence of hypervirulent CRKP\n(hv-CRKP) strains has added another layer of complexity, as they\ncombine high virulence with multidrug resistance, severely limiting\ntreatment options and increasing mortality rates ( 4). ST11, a\ndominant CRKP clone in China, has emerged as a high-risk lineage\ndue to its ability to acquire virulence plasmids (5). Zhou et al.\nreported that ST11-KL64 CRKP has gradually replaced ST11-KL47\nand become the most prevalent and highly virulent CRKP clone\nin China since 2016 (6). This lineage poses a signiﬁcant public\nhealth threat, particularly amongimmunocompromised individuals,\ndue to its enhanced transmissibility, multidrug resistance, and\nhypervirulence (7). The propagation of CRKP among individuals\nwith hematological malignancies presents a particularly worrisome\nchallenge ( 8– 11). Favorable conditions for the spread of\nCRKP infection include potent ial blood disorders, intensi ﬁed\nchemotherapy, neutropenia, gastrointestinal mucositis, and prolonged\nhospitalization, all of which heighten the risk of bacteremia (8– 10).\nThe mortality rate associated with CRKP bacteremia in individuals\nwith neutropenic hepatopathy has been reported to be approximately\n60%, with a continued high prevalence expected, particularly among\nrecipients of BMT (12, 13). Infections caused by ST11 hv-CRKP\nstrains are further exacerbated by their rapid evolution of resistance\nunder antibiotic pressure, with mechanisms involving ramR, mgrB,\nand pmrB mutations contributing to resistance to last-resort\nantibiotics like polymyxin and tigecycline (14). In addition, the\nemergence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) has been\nobserved at a higher rate (55.3%) in immunocompromised patients\n(11). However, there remains a paucity of research examining the\nimpact of hv-CRKP on this high-risk population.\nCurrently, the therapeutic op tions available for hv-CRKP\ninfection remain limited. Polymyxin and tigecycline are regarded as\nlast-resort antibiotics in the management of CRKP-related infections\n(4, 15, 16). Regrettably, bacteria can develop resistance to polymyxin\nand tigecycline through alterations in mgrB, mutations in the two-\ncomponent regulatory system (pmrABCDK and phoPQ), or\ndisruption of regulatory genes that encode efﬂux pumps (e.g., ramR,\nramA, and rarA) (17, 18). These resistance mechanisms further\ncomplicate the management of hv-CRKP infections and highlight\nthe urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies.\nDespite increasing attention to hv-CRKP infections, particularly\nin immunocompromised populations, there remains limited\nunderstanding of the genetic determinants underlying hypervirulence\nand multidrug resistance, especially in strains like ST11-KL64.\nMoreover, the concurrent presence of multiple resistance genes (e.g.,\nbla\nCTX-M-65,b l aKPC-2) and virulence factors (e.g.,rmpA, iucABCD)i n\na single hv-CRKP strain raises questions about their roles in clinical\noutcomes and therapeutic challenges. In addition, transmission of\nhv-CRKP is closely linked to its presence in the gut, which makes it\nmore widespread in community and healthcare Settings (19). To\naddress these gaps, our study aims to comprehensively characterize\nthe genomic features of the ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain CZC, with a\nfocus on the mechanisms driving its hypervirulence and resistance to\ncritical antibiotics. By elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to\nprovide insights that could inform effective strategies for managing\nhv-CRKP infections in high-risk populations.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Aerospace Center\nHospital (No. JHYLS-2022– 122). Verbal informed consent was\nobtained from the subject in this study. This study informed\nverbal consent was obtained from participant.\nMedical history of infection\nAn 18-year-old male patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic\nstem cell transplantation due to primary immunodeﬁciency disease.\nSoon afterwards, the patient was diagnosed with a bloodstream\ninfection, and a CRKP isolate (named CZC) was isolated from\nthe blood sample. Combination antibiotic treatment was used\nimmediately, including meropenem, polymyxin, ceftazidime\navibactam, vancomycin, and tigecycline. Unfortunately, the patient\ndied from this infection.\nIsolation and identiﬁcation of bacteria\nK. pneumoniae CZC was isolated from the blood samples of\nthis patient. Blood culture was done using a BACT/ALERT® 3D\nblood culture system(bioMérieux, France). Bacteria was\nconﬁrmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-\nof-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry(MS) (Vitek MS,\nbioMerieux, France). In addition, molecular genotyping\n(serotyping and multilocus sequence typing) and phenotype\nvalidation (antibiotic susceptibility assay and Galleria mellonella\ninfection model) were examined.\nPhenotypic characterization\nWe employed the disk diffusion method in our testing.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using GN335\ncards from the Vitek 2 Compact system (bioMérieux, France), with\nbroth microdilution and disk diffusion methods used to validate the\nresults for certain antibiotics (20) Colistin was tested using the broth\nmicrodilution method, while meropenem, imipenem, and tigecycline\nwere tested using the disk diffusion method and the results were\ninterpreted according to the CLSI standards. The virulence\nphenotype was evaluated by theG. mellonellalarvae infection model.\nNTUH-K2044 served as a hypervirulent control strain, while 13,190,\nveriﬁed by whole-genome sequencing to lack virulence genes, was\nused as a low-virulence control strain (21, 22). All experiments were\nperformed with three replications. The statistical analysis was\nperformed using GraphPad Prism software.\nLuo et al. 10.3389/fped.2024.1450201\nFrontiers inPediatrics 02 frontiersin.org\nGenomic DNA sequencing, assembly,\ncorrection, and annotation\nWhole-genome sequencing was performed using the\nPromethION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc., UK).\nThis strain was resequenced using Illumina NovoSeq 6,000\nsequencing platform (Illumina, CA, USA) to prevent or correct\nerrors. The complete genome was generated by Unicycler v0.4.4\n(23) and annotated using RAST (24) .I n f o r m a t i o no nt h eC Z C\nstrain has been submitted to the NCBI database with the project\naccession number PRJNA865496. The biosample number is\nSAMN30114398 and the accession numbers CP102390– CP102396.\nBioinformatics analysis\nThe circular genome maps were drawn with Proksee\n(https://proksee.ca). The virulence genes were identiﬁed using the\nPasteur Institute and VFanalyzer databases. The resistance genes\nwere identiﬁed using ResFinder. The SNP-based phylogenetic\ntree was constructed using the Pathogenwatch phylogenetic tool\n(https://pathogen.watch), and the isolates were compared to twenty-\nnine strains of ST11-KL64K. pneumoniaeisolates and the genomes\nof the CZC strain, which is available in the Pathogenwatch database.\nThe 1972 core genes library of K. pneumoniae were used in\nPathogenwatch to generate pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism\n(SNP) distances between genomes, which are used to construct\nneighbor-joining trees (25). The information on resistance genes and\nisolated countries was derived from annotation information in\nPathogenwatch. iToL was used for phylogenetic tree improvement\n(26). The incompatible plasmid groups were identi ﬁed using\nPlasmidFinder. The type of plasmid was determined by comparison\nto the nucleotide database using BLAST.\nResults\nPatient history\nThe patient was diagnosed with splenomegaly at the age of 6,\naccompanied by recurrent fever and lymphadenopathy, which\ngradually progressed to pancytopenia. Genetic testing identiﬁed a\nmutation in the XIAP gene, conﬁrming a diagnosis of X-linked\nlymphoproliferative disease. At 18 years old, the patient developed\nhemophagocytic syndrome, which showed poor response to\nchemotherapy. As a result, an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation was performed, with the donor being a fully\nmatched (10/10) unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor. Two\nmonths post-transplant, the patient experienced sudden chills and\nrigor, with a temperature spike to 39°C. Blood pressure dropped to\n80/50 mmHg, urine output became scant, and the heart rate\nincreased to 130 beats per minute. Laboratory tests revealed IL-6\nlevels exceeding 4,000 ng/ml, PCT levels peaking at 59 ng/ml, and\nCRP levels above 150 ng/ml. Blood cultures conﬁrmed the presence\nof K. pneumoniae. A chest x-ray performed the following day\nshowed extensive pulmonary inﬁltrates in both lungs, accompanied\nby respiratory distress and type I respiratory failure. By the fourth\nday, the patient succumbed to multi-organ dysfunction, with sepsis\nand pulmonary ARDS identiﬁed as the primary causes of death.\nResistance and virulence phenotypes of\nK. pneumoniae strains\nK. pneumoniae CZC showed resistance to a total of seventeen\nantibiotics in eleven categories. In particular, it was resistant to\ntigecycline, polymyxin, meropenem, imipenem and amikacin\n(Table 1). In addition, we performed testing using the disk diffusion\nmethod and broth microdilution method. The MIC value for\ncolistin was ≥4.0 mg/L, for meropenem was ≥16.0 µg/ml, for\nimipenem was≥16.0 µg/ml, and for tigecycline was≥4 µg/ml, with\nan inhibition zone diameter of less than 14 mm. Additionally, for\nCZA tested by disk diffusion, the inhibition zone diameter was\n22 mm, which is considered intermediate (I), indicating that the\nstrain’s resistance to CZA falls between susceptible and resistant. In\naddition, we used two control strains (hvKP strain NTUH-K2044\nand CRKP strain 13,190) andK. pneumoniae CZC for virulence\nphenotype experiments. The G. mellonella larvae infected with\nK. pneumoniae CZC and NTUH-K2044 had signiﬁcantly lower\nsurvival than those infected with CR-KP 13,190 (Figure 1). These\nresults suggest thatK. pneumoniaeCZC is a hypervirulent strain.\nGenomic characterization of the St11-Kl64\nhv-CRKP CZC strain\nTo analyze the genetic characteristics of the strain, we performed\nOxford Nanopore and Illumina genome sequencing and drew the\nTABLE 1 Antimicrobial resistances forK. pneumoniaeCZC.\nDrug Abbreviation MIC\n(mg/L)\nSusceptibility\nMinocycline MNO ≥16.0 R\nDoxycycline DO ≥16.0 R\nTigecyclinea,b TGC ≥4.0 R\nCeftazidime/avibactamb CZA 4 S\nColistina CS ≥4.0 R\nSulfamethoxazole SXT ≥320.0 R\nTicarcillin/clavulnic acid TCC ≥128.0 R\nPiperacillin/Tazobactam TZP ≥128.0 R\nAztreonam ATM ≥64.0 R\nCiproﬂoxacin CIP ≥4.0 R\nLevoﬂoxacin LEV ≥8.0 R\nCeftazidim CAZ ≥64.0 R\nCefoperazone/Sulbactam SFP ≥64.0 R\nCefepime FEP ≥32.0 R\nImipenema IPM ≥16.0 R\nMeropenema MEM ≥16.0 R\nAmikacin AMK ≥64.0 R\nTobramycin TOB ≥16.0 R\naBroth microdilution method.\nbDisk diffusion method.\nLuo et al. 10.3389/fped.2024.1450201\nFrontiers inPediatrics 03 frontiersin.org\ncomplete genome map (Supplementary Figure S1), including a\nchromosome with 5,349,784 bp and six plasmids (pVir-1,\npKPC-ESBL-2, pRM-3, pTET-4, pColRNAI-5, and p6) (Table 2).\nAccording to the MLST and capsule type results,K. pneumoniae\nCZC belongs to the ST11/CG258 and KL64 capsule types.\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that the ST11-KL64 strains have\ndeveloped a greater population clone ( Figure 2).

Meanwhile, pVir-1 (193,821 bp,\nIncHI1B/FIB), with rmpA, ΔrmpA2, iucABCD, iutA, and ΔiroN,\nis highly homologous to the virulence plasmid pLVPK (89%\ncoverage, 99.43% identity) ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The\nIncFIB/IncHI1B type virulence plasmid could be transferred via\nconjugation to Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae strains,\nleading to a sharp increase in the prevalence of hv-CRKP in\nclinical settings, which poses a great threat to human health (27).\nComparative analysis of MDR-resistant\nregions\nThe MDR regions of K. pneumoniae CZC were mainly\ndistributed on pKPC-ESBL-2 (IncFII/IncR) and pTET-4 (IncFII).\npKPC-ESBL-2 was divided into two parts ( Figure 3 ,\nSupplementary Figure S4 ). One part is the ESBL region\ncontaining blaCTX-M-65, blaTEM-1B, rmtB, and blaSHV-12. The IS1R-\nIS26 element in the ends of the entire MDR region can mediate\nhomologous recombination in the corresponding region\n(Figure 3A). The other part is the KPC-2 region, a truncated\nTn6296 ﬂanked by an IS26 insertion that can mediate the\ntransfer of theblaKPC-2-resistant region (Figure 3B).\nFIGURE 2\nThe phylogenetic tree and heatmap of AMR genes of ST11-KL64.

Genetic analysis revealed that tigecycline\nresistance was associated with the tet(A) gene, with the Tet(A)-\nS251A mutation identiﬁed on the conjugal plasmid pTET-4. This\nmutation correlated with increased MICs for tigecycline,\ntetracycline, and minocycline. Polymyxin resistance was linked to\nmgrB-M1V, phoQ-D150G, pmrB-R256G, pmrC-Q319R, pmrD-\nD80G, and pmrK-Q156H R157S mutations within the MgrB,\nPhoPQ, and PmrABCDK systems ( Table 4). Additionally, the\nprotein KpnEF in the CZC strain may play a role in capsule\nsynthesis and resistance to polymyxin. The presence of a type\nI R-M system in pRM-3 and a predicted Retron region in\npColRNAI-5 suggests potential antiphage defense mechanisms in\nthe strain.\nFIGURE 3\nLineal comparison of multidrug-resistant regions of pKPC-ESBL-2.

Zhou et al. reported that ST11-KL64 CRKP had\ngradually replaced ST11-KL47 and became the most prevalent\nand highly virulent CRKP clone in China since 2016 (28). In our\nstudy, a novel ST11-KL64 CZC strain wasﬁrst isolated from the\nblood of pediatric BMT patient and was identiﬁed to have a high\nvirulence and multidrug-resistant phenotype. The genome\nanalysis indicates that hypervirulent K. pneumoniae with\ntigecycline, polymyxin and carbapenem resistance might result in\nﬁnal antibiotic treatment failure. The spread of these strains\nposes an enormous threat to public health.\nThe hypervirulent phenotype of CZC is mainly provided by the\npLVPK-like virulence plasmid carrying the virulence genesrmpA,\nΔrmpA2, iucABCD, and iutA. They play an important role in\ninhibiting phagocytosis of host cells, immune evasion, increasing\nbactericidal activity, and anti-phagocytosis (29), which increase\nhvKP strain survival in the host and spread from the bloodstream.\nIn terms of drug resistance, CZC shows resistance to\ntigecycline, polymyxin, meropenem, and imipenem ( Table 1).\nThe CRKP resistance gene blaKPC-2 is located on the MDR\nplasmid pKPC-ESBL-2. It has an IncFII (pHN7A8)/IncR\nbackbone containing two MDR regions (ESBLs and KPC-2),\nwhich is different from the structure of pHN7A8. The ESBL\nresistance region contain an IS26- blaSHV-12-IS26 unit and the\nblaKPC-2 resistant unit. In China, blaKPC-2 is most commonly\nfound in an environment with an IS26-Tn6296 compound\ntransposon ( 30). The type of IncFII/IncR plasmid plays\nan important role in the spread of CRKP, carrying various\nresistance genes effectively (31). The IncFII/IncR-type blaKPC-2-\nbearing plasmid could be transferred via conjugation to\nEnterobacteriaceae strains alone as well as together with the\nIncFIB/IncHI1B-type virulence plasmid (32). Another resistance\nplasmid, pTET-4, has an IncFIIpKp_Goe_414-4-type backbone\nwith qnrS1, blaLAP-2, sul2, dfrA14, tet (A), and tet(R).They were\nlocated in an MDR region ( ΔTn6591-ΔTn1721 region and\ntruncated IS26– blaLAP-2– qnrS1– IS26 unit). The results showed\nthat IS26 as well as transposons and integrons are essential for\nincreasing multidrug resistance inK. pneumoniae.\nOur analysis identiﬁed the Tet(A)-S251A mutation on the\nconjugal plasmid pTET-4, which has been previously shown to\nconfer high-level tigecycline resistance in CRKP strains and E.\ncoli ATCC 25,922, alongside increased MICs for tetracycline and\nminocycline (32, 33). Furthermore, the synergy between the tet\n(A) variant and the RND-type efﬂux transporters contributes to\ntigecycline resistance in A. baumannii (34), and this may also\nwork in K. pneumoniae . Furthermore, sporadically reported\nmutations of genes ( pmrBCDK, phoQ, and mgrB) even\nsimultaneously occurred to acquire polymyxin resistance in our\nCZC isolate. These include mgrB-M1V, phoQ-D150G,\npmrB-R256G, pmrC-Q319R, pmrD-D80G, and pmrK-Q156H\nR157S mutations within the MgrB, PhoPQ, and PmrABCDK\nsystems, consistent with their known roles in elevating\npolymyxin MICs ( 21). Additionally, the KpnEF protein may\ncontribute to capsule synthesis regulation and resistance\nmechanisms, as reported inE. coli (35).\nWith the complication of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent\nneed for adequate antimicrobial agents to treat hv-CRKP\ninfections. Tigecycline is regarded as a last resort treatment for\nCRKP infections and is widely used in clinical practice (36, 37).\nTherefore, the emergence of tigecycline and polymyxin resistance\nin hv-CRKP infection makes clinical treatment difﬁcult (4) due\nto amino acid mutations in common targets. In addition to\nmutations in resistance genes, the presence of an antibiotic efﬂux\npump in this strain may also have implications for its increased\nantimicrobial drug resistance (33). The involvement of Tet(A)-\nS251A and MgrB-M1V, and the synergy of the RND-type efﬂux\ntransporters in the mechanisms of tigecycline resistance are\nworthy of further study. In addition, the Tet (A) S251A variant\nis located in the conjugative plasmid pTET-4, which provides a\ngenetic basis for cotransfer with plasmids.\nFurthermore, a type I R-M system and a predicted Retron\nregion contained in the plasmid of CZC provide antiphage\ndefense to the strain ( 38). In conclusion, the ST11-KL64 hv-\nCRKP CZC strain showed worrying results regarding antibiotic\nresistance and virulence. Our results suggest the potential of this\nstrain to become a novel signiﬁcant superbug and a threat to\npublic health. In particular, it presents a deadly threat to\nimmunocompromised patients.\nOur study builds on existing knowledge of ST11-KL64 CRKP\nstrains, which have been widely recognized as high-risk clones\nwith signiﬁcant virulence and resistance potential (28). Previous\nworks have documented the gradual replacement of ST11-KL47\nby ST11-KL64 as the dominant CRKP clone in China, driven by\nits enhanced virulence and transmissibility (\n28). Similarly, the\nhypervirulent phenotype in hv-CRKP has been previously\nattributed to pLVPK-like plasmids carrying virulence genes like\nrmpA and iucABCD (31). However, our study provides unique\ninsights by identifying a novel ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP strain\n(CZC) from a pediatric BMT patient. Unlike previous reports, we\ndemonstrated the coexistence of hypervirulence and resistance to\ncarbapenems, tigecycline, and polymyxin within this strain.\nSpeciﬁcally, we uncovered the genetic mechanisms of tigecycline\nresistance through the Tet(A)-S251A mutation and its synergy\nTABLE 4 Mgrb, PhoPQ and PmrABCDK mutations.\nName Amino acid alterations\nmgrB phoP phoQ pmrA pmrB pmrC pmrD pmrK\nCZC M1V WT D150G WT R256G Q319R D80G Q156H, R157S\nAnnotations of Amino acid alterations were based on the protein sequence of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044 (Accession no.

Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of mgrB and\nphoQ mutations in polymyxin resistance aligns with previous\nﬁndings (21) but also expands the understanding by highlighting\ntheir co-occurrence with additional resistance determinants\nwithin the CZC strain.\nConclusions\nBased on a drug-susceptibility assay and aG. mellonellalarvae\ninfection model, we ﬁrst con ﬁrmed the coexistence of\nhypervirulence and polymyxin, tigecycline, and carbapenem\nresistance in the ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP CZC strain. Further, we\nconﬁrmed the genetic basis of these phenotypes through\ncomplete genome sequencing. Notably, resistance to polymyxin\nand tigecycline is a fatal threat to immunocompromised pediatric\npatients, especially those with BMT.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online\nrepositories.

Established protein engineering methods\nhave largely focused on tuning naturally occurring proteins through\niterative experimental selection pro c e s s e ss u c ha sd i r e c t e de v o l u t i o n\n(Dougherty and Arnold, 2009). Recently there has been rapid\nprogress in computational methods for protein design. Many\napproaches to design protein backbones, such as hallucination-\nbased methods (Norn et al,2021;F r a n ke ta l ,2024; Tischer et al,\n2020;W a n ge ta l ,2022; Wicky et al,2022) and denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPM) (Watson et al, 2023; Lisanza et al,\n2024; Ingraham et al,2022; Yim et al,2023), have been developed,\nwith diffusion models, so far, outperforming most hallucination-\nbased approaches in design quality. Combined with neural\nnetworks capable of generating native-like sequences folding into\nany given protein backbone structure (Ingraham et al, 2019;\nDauparas et al, 2022) these methods have enabled rapid design of\nproteins with a variety of properties (Wicky et al,2022; Yeh et al,\n2023). Most current studies on machine-learning-based protein\ndesign methods focus mostly on denovo protein design tasks, such\nas de novo monomer design (Norn et al,2021; Frank et al,2024;\nYim et al,2023; Lin and AlQuraishi,2023; Lisanza et al,2024)o r\nhomooligomer design (Wicky et al, 2022). This functionality has\nbeen extended to site-speciﬁc protein binder design by more recent\nDDPM-based methods (Watson et al, 2023) but these require\nconsiderable engineering and training efforts to arrive at a usable\nmodel.\nWhile these methods and design capabilities have great\npotential, they currently address only a fraction of the functional\nproperties of natural proteins. Many proteins exhibit multiple\nfunctionally relevant states, either by binding multiple partners\nand/or through exhibiting conformational changes across the\ncourse of their natural function.\nWhile prior work has investigated the potential of machine\nlearning for designing sequences compatible with multiple\nconformations, such work has largely relied on the use of\nmanually-designed structural b lueprints (Praetorius et al, 2023;\nGuo et al, 2024), instead of generating multi-state protein\nbackbones and sequences fully de novo.\nHere we describe AlphaDesign, a protein design framework, the\nversatility of which enables both standard (single-state) and multi-\nstate protein design by combining hallucination and diffusion-\n1European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.2Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences,\nHeidelberg, Germany. 3Institute of Microbiology, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.4Division of Microbial Ecology, Centre for Microbiology and\nEnvironmental Systems Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.5Chair of Biochemistry IV, Biophysical Chemistry, University of Bayreuth, 95447 Bayreuth, Germany.\n6Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Core Facility, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.7DenovAI Biotech Ltd., Rehovot 7670104, Israel.✉E-mail: jan.korbel@embl.de;\nkashif@denovai.com\n1234567890();,:\n1166 Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 © The Author(s)\nbased approaches. Our approach leverages AlphaFold (AF) (Jumper\net al, 2021) for structure prediction and autoregressive diffusion\nmodels (ADM) (Hoogeboom et al,2022) for sequence optimisation.\nTo develop a method capable of designing proteins with any given\nset of properties, we combine AF structure predictions and\nconﬁdence measures into ﬁtness functions encoding various\nprotein design tasks. Given a sufﬁciently powerful optimiser, the\ndetermining factor for protein design success lies entirely in the\nﬁtness function. While prior work on hallucination-based protein\ndesign optimised various conﬁdence measures for speciﬁcp r o t e i n\ndesign tasks, we expand on this line of research by developing\nmodular ﬁtness functions which can be combined to achieve\nprotein complex design, binder d esign, as well as multi-state\nprotein design.\nWe utilise an evolutionary algorithm (Sinai et al, 2020)a sa n\noptimiser to search for amino acid sequences maximising these\nﬁtness functions (Fig. 1 (red)). This ensures that we can, in\nprinciple, optimise proteins for any combination of properties that\ncan be predicted by AF, including changes in conformation\nbetween monomeric and complex structures as well as binding to\nmultiple target proteins.\nOptimising sequences for high structure prediction conﬁdence\nruns the risk of generating adversarial examples for AF which are\nunlikely to be recombinantly expressed in E. coli or adopt the\ndesigned tertiary structure. Indeed, prior work showed that amino\nacid sequences designed in a similar way are unlikely to be\nexpressed (Wicky et al, 2022; Goverde et al, 2022; Verkuil et al,\n2022).\nIn order to avoid this issue and to overcome major challenges in\nthe ﬁeld associated with solubility and expressibility of de novo\ndesigned proteins (Wicky et al,2022; Frank et al,2024), we further\nredesign the sequences of high-ﬁtness candidate proteins using an\nADM (Hoogeboom et al,2022), trained on the PDB (Fig.1 (blue)).\nThis ADM generates a set of new native-like sequences for each\nstructure returned by the evolutionary algorithm. We ﬁnd that\nsequence redesign is a crucial ingredient for successful protein\ndesign with AlphaFold. We combine this design pipeline with\nautomated computational validation and design selection by\npredicting the structures of our designs with AlphaFold and\nESMfold (Wu et al, 2022). As de novo designed proteins do not\nhave evolutionary information attached to them, we predict their\nstructures from their sequence alone without providing a multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA). While AlphaFold is known to lose\naccuracy on natural proteins in the absence of MSA information,\nprior work has shown that single-sequence prediction is effective in\nevaluating design success for de novo designed proteins and has\nbecome the de facto standard fo r computational evaluation of\nprotein designs (Bennett et al,2022; Wicky et al,2022;M a r t i ne ta l ,\n2024).\nIn contrast to most previous approaches, our hybrid framework\nproduces results that are competitive with DDPM-based methods,\nwhilst retaining the full ﬂexibility of hallucination-based\napproaches. Only recently Frank et al demonstrated a comparable\napproach yielding similar results to RFDiffusion on de novo protein\ndesign (Frank et al,2024). We show state-of-the-art performance of\nAlphaDesign on computational de novo protein design benchmarks\nand demonstrate hallucination-based protein binder design beyond\nshort peptides (Bryant and Elofsson,2022;R e t t i ee ta l ,2023), which\nhas been shown to be possible only in one concurrent work on\nprotein design (Pacesa et al,2024) .O u rm e t h o di sv e r s a t i l ee n o u g h\nFigure 1. Overview of the AlphaDesign pipeline.\nThe AlphaDesign pipeline consists of two main stages: candidate structure generation (red) and sequence redesign (blue). In theﬁrst stage, a pool of random amino acid\nsequences has their structures and conﬁdence measures (pLDDT, pAE) predicted using AlphaFold. These are combined into aﬁtness function, which in turn is maximised\nusing an evolutionary algorithm. Once a sequence’s ﬁtness reaches a threshold, its predicted structure (raw structure) is returned for sequence redesign and\ncomputational validation. The second stage uses an autoregressive diffusion model (ADM) trained on the PDB to generate new sequences for each structure from theﬁrst\nstage. These are then re-predicted using multiple structure predictors (predicted structure). Sequences with low-conﬁdence predicted structures or high RMSD to the raw\nstructure are discarded. Source data are available online for thisﬁgure.\nMichael A Jendrusch et al Molecular Systems Biology\n© The Author(s) Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 1167\nto design proteins with various properties for example, proteins\nthat are predicted to change conformation upon binding, as well as\nproteins predicted to bind multiple homologues of a protein, all\nwithout the requirement for model re-training or ﬁne-tuning.\nThese features are absent from other machine learning-based tools\nfor protein design. In addition to extensive computational\nvalidation using accurate structure prediction tools and all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the real-world\napplicability of our method by systematically designing and\nexperimentally validating inhibitors of the toxic effector RcaT\nfound in the most prevalent sub-family of retrons, a newly\ndiscovered bacterial phage defense system (Millman et al, 2020;\nGao et al,2020; Bobonis et al,2022). We conﬁrmed in vivo activity\nfor 17 out of 88 designs, as well as expression and fold using NMR\nstructure determination for 2 designs.\nResults\nGeneration of designable monomers and oligomers\nAs aﬁrst step to demonstrate the capabilities of our framework, we\ngenerated raw sequences and structures of globular monomeric\nproteins, oligomers and proteins predicted to change conformation\nupon binding (Fig.2A–C). We generated monomers by maximising\nAlphaFold conﬁdence, subject to a radiuspenalty (Appendix Table\nS2, L\ndenovo ). We then used an ADM to produce a set of redesigned\nsequences for each generated raw structure.\nWe computationally assessed design success by predicting the\nstructures of these sequences with AF and ESMfold (Evolutionary\nScale Modelling) (Wu et al, 2022). We used ESMfold as an\nadditional protein structure predictor for validation in order to\nensure that our designed sequences were not biased for AlphaFold.\nA designed sequence was deemed successful if the predicted local\ndistance difference test (pLDDT) was >70 and the root mean\nsquared deviation (self-consistent RMSD; scRMSD) between the\nraw generated and predicted structure was <2.0 Å — thresholds\nchosen in agreement with the state of the art of computational\nprotein design approaches (Watson et al, 2023). Structure\nprediction showed very good agreement between generated and\npredicted structures with RMSD < 2 Å for a majority of designs\n(Figs. 3A and EV1A,B). More precisely, 97.6% and 98.6% of\ndesigned 50 AA monomers were successful according to AF and\nESMfold, respectively (100 AA: 92.8% and 98.6%, 200 AA: 85.3%\nand 89.3%, 300 AA: 72.4% and 86.2%).\nSimilarly, we were able to design heterodimers and homo-\noligomers by maximising AlphaFold con ﬁdence for jointly\npredicting the structure of multiple amino acid sequences. We\nonce again obtained high rates of success for designed heterodimers\nand homooligomers (Figs. 2Ba n d3A) with 79.5% of designed 50\nAA heterodimers (respectively, hom o d i m e r s :7 2 . 4 % ,t r i m e r s :7 4 . 3 % ,\ntetramers: 70.1%) deemed successful using AF, compared to 60.0%\nusing ESMfold (respectively, homodimers: 50.8%, trimers: 34.2%,\ntetramers: 47.8%). This difference in success-rates mirrors previous\nresults, and suggests that ESMfold performs worse at complex\nstructure prediction (Wu et al, 2022) and predicts designed\nstructures even for suboptimal de novo designed sequences (Martin\net al, 2024).\nTo test the limits of ourﬁtness function-based design approach,\nwe optimised pairs of amino acid sequences to minimise the\ntemplate modelling score (TM score) between each sequence\npredicted as a monomer, and the pair of sequences predicted as a\nFigure 2. De novo designed proteins.\n(A, B) example structures of de novo designed monomers with sequence length from 50 to 100 amino acids and complexes of 2 to 4 monomers with a sequence length of\n50 amino acids.

TM-score measures the structural similarity\nbetween two protein structures, with scores below 0.5 indicating\ndifferent folds (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004). Thus, a pair of\nsequences with low TM-score between monomeric and complex\nstate is essentially predicted to change conformation upon binding.\nWhile our approach was able to generate designs predicted to\nchange conformation, it yielded lower success-rates compared to\nunconstrained de novo design (Fig. EV2A,B).\nLower TM-scores between the monomeric and bound state of a\ndesign correspond to a more pronounced change in conformation.\nBy penalising designs with TM-scores above a maximum threshold\n(TM-score < 0.1, 0.3, 0.5), we were able to control the degree of\nconformational change. For a maximum TM-score of 0.1, we were\nable to recover 3.6% of successf ul designs (respectively, TM-\nscore < 0.3: 12.5%, TM-score < 0.5: 12.0%). This shows that our\nm e t h o dc a nd e s i g np r o t e i n sp r e d i c t e dt oc h a n g ec o n f o r m a t i o ni na\nhighly controllable manner, as assessed by state-of-the-art compu-\ntational validation.\nIn addition to achieving a high de novo design success rate, our\nmethod also produces proteins with diverse and novel structures\nwith folds ranging from all- α-helical to all- β-sheet (Fig. 2A,B).\nFurther analysis shows that designs are diverse relative to each\nother (Fig. 3B) and a high fraction are novel, relative to the PDB\n(Fig. 3C), with median similarity as measured by TM-score (Zhang\nand Skolnick, 2004) decreasing with sequence length. Taken\ntogether, these results indicate that our method is indeed capable\nof de novo designing diverse and novel proteins.\nDe novo protein design is competitive with state-of-the-\nart approaches\nIn order to evaluate our approach relative to the state of the art, we\ncompared the quality of our designs to RFDiffusion (Watson et al,\n2023). We found our designed sequences and structures showed\ncompetitive performance across both monomers and oligomers of\nvarious sizes (Fig.3D) as measured by scRMSD and pLDDT. In total,\nFigure 3.

This\nindicates that our method produces comparable or improved results to\nthe state of the art protein diffusion model, while representing a\nhallucination-based approach.\nComputational complexity\nWe assessed the computational complexity of our method for de\nnovo monomer design across different monomer sizes from 50 to\n300 amino acids. We found that the number of design iterations\nincreases rapidly with both the desiredﬁt n e s so fam o n o m e ra n di t s\nsize (Appendix Fig. S1A). Fitting a polynomial to the data, revealed\nthat the time needed per design on a single A40 GPU scaled as\nOðN3:8Þ with N the length of the amino acid sequence (Appendix\nFig. S1B). Our method at least partly inherits this complexity from\nAlphaFold, which scales as OðN3Þ with protein sequence length.\nThis suboptimal complexity is a shortcoming of our method,\ncompared to diffusion-based approaches (Table 1). However,\nconcurrent work has shown that this can be remedied by using\ndifferent sequence optimisers (Frank et al, 2024)a sw e l la sm o r e\nlight-weight protein structure predictors (Jeliazkov et al,2023).\nSequence redesign is crucial for design quality\nTo assess the impact of ADM redesign on de novo design quality, we\nevaluated both raw and redesigned outputs of AlphaDesign in terms of\npLDDT, scRMSD computed using AF and ESMfold, interface\npredicted aligned error (ipAE) (Evans et al, 2021) and predicted\nsolubility (Sormanni et al,2015). We observed an increase in predicted\nsolubility (Sormanni et al,2015) for 98.6% of redesigned monomers\nover raw sequences obtained by optimisation (Fig.4A), coupled with a\ndecrease in ESMfold scRMSD for 92.2% of designs (Fig.4B).\nCompared to ADM-redesigned sequences, scRMSD and pLDDT\nusing ESMfold of raw sequences rapidly deteriorates with size for\nboth monomers and oligomers (Fig. 4C,D; red). Consistent with\nprior work (Goverde et al,2022; Verkuil et al,2022), this suggests\nthat optimising sequences for high AlphaFold con ﬁdence may\nresult in adversarial examples for AlphaFold. In contrast,\nredesigned sequences are predicted to fold conﬁdently using both\nAlphaFold (Fig. 4C,D; dark blue) and ESMfold (Fig. 4C,D; light\nblue), with median scRMSD < 2 Å and pLDDT > 70.\nFurthermore, ADM redesign reduces the relative frequency of\nlarge hydrophobic amino acids (PHE, TRP, TYR) associated with\npoor protein solubility (Fig.4E,F). Conversely, redesign results in a\nhigher fraction of polar and charged amino acids in the protein\nsurface (Fig. 4E) which is predicted to improve designed protein\nsolubility. This suggests that ADMsequence redesign is indeed vital\nto ensure successful design of unbiased sequences as measured by\nscRMSD and predicted solubility.\nAlphaDesign ADM is comparable to ProteinMPNN with\ncomplementary structure preference\nNext, we compared the performance of our ADM on de novo\ndesigned proteins to ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al,2022)as t a t e -\nof-the-art model for protein sequence design. We generated\n32 sequences for each protein using either ProteinMPNN or our\nADM and evaluated the best sequences in terms of AlphaFold\nscRMSD and pLDDT for both models.\nWe found that on monomers, ProteinMPNN and our ADM\nshowed very similar performance in terms of scRMSD and pLDDT\nof their respective generated sequences, outperforming each other\non roughly 50% of de novo designed monomers (Fig. 5A). In\naggregate, the percentage of successful designs was almost exactly\nt h es a m ef o rb o t h( F i g .5B). For oligomers, ProteinMPNN\noutperformed our model in terms of scRMSD in 70% of monomers,\nwhile showing comparable performance in terms of pLDDT\n(Fig. 5C), as well as a similar aggregate performance in terms of\ndesign success rate (Fig. 5D). This led us to believe that both\nmodels had learned complementary ways of generating protein\nsequences given a protein backbone.\nWe thus combined 16 sequences per backbone from ADM and\nProteinMPNN to see if we could improve success rates by leveraging\nthe complementarity of both methods. We found that using sequences\nfrom both ProteinMPNN and ADM improved success rates in all cases\nfor both monomers and oligomers (Fig.5B,D; red). This indicates that\ni n d e e do u rA D Mc a nb eu s e da sa ni n d e p e n d e n tt o o lf o rp r o t e i n\nsequence design to complement existing approaches.\nGeneration of small protein binder designs with\nhigh AF2 success rate\nNext, we applied AlphaDesign to design protein binders for a wide\nvariety of protein targets (immune-related proteins PD-1 & PD-L1;\nSARS-CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD); RNase A; S.\nenterica-derived retron-encoded toxin RcaT-Sen2 (Bobonis et al,\n2022)). We speciﬁed an epitope (blue) on each target protein except\nSARS-CoV2 spike RBD, in order to demonstrate a binder design\nprocess without site-speci ﬁc constraints (Fig. 6A). After bench-\nmarking designed binders with AF, we identiﬁed computationally\nsuccessful binders for each target protein. According to standard\ncomputational measures for design success (complex scRMSD < 2\nÅ, binder pLDDT > 70), 39.1% of designed 50 AA binders\n(respectively, 30.6% for 100 A A) were found to be successful\n(Fig. 6D,E). Comparing per-target success rates to RFdiffusion, we\nfound increased computational s uccess-rates for AlphaDesign\nbinders as compared to RFdiffusion binders for all targets other\nthan RcaT-Sen2 (Fig. 6D). Even according to more stringent\ncriteria for computational design success proposed in (Bennett et al,\n2022) with complex scRMSD < 1 Å and ipAE < 10 Å, we still\nrecover 6% of 50 AA designs (2.7% of 100 AA designs). Evaluating\nonly ipAE, these values increase to 21.8% for 50 AA designs (10.4%\nfor 100 AA designs) (Fig. EV3A,B).\nAdditionally, to assess the plausibility of generated sequences\nand structures, we subjected the binder designs to all-atom\nTable 1.

Binders showed low root\nmean square ﬂuctuation (RMSF; Fig. 6A–C), a consistent number\nof interface contacts (Appendix Fig. S2A), as well as predicted\nafﬁnities in theμM to nM range (Fig. EV3C). While PRODIGY was\ndeveloped for afﬁnity prediction of existing structural interfaces\nand may not necessarily extend to de novo designed interfaces,\nreaching reasonable predicted KD across a statistical ensemble of\nstructures provides an additional check of design plausibility. This\nindicates that AlphaDesign produces computationally plausible\nbinder designs, both according to AF2 prediction and molecular\ndynamics simulations.\nBispeciﬁc and conformation-changing binder design\nBeyond simple binder design, we generated bispeci ﬁcb i n d e r\ndesigns predicted to bind different homologues of the spike\nreceptor binding domain (SARS-CoV2 spike RBD for the delta\nand omicron variants, as well as MERS spike RBD) and Retron cold\nanaerobic Toxin (RcaT-Sen2, Rcat-Eco1) (Figs. 6Ba n dE V 4 A ) ,a s\nwell as binder designs predicted to change conformation upon\ntarget binding (Figs. 6C and EV4B; Appendix Fig. S2B). As for\nconformational change designs, we were able to control the degree\nof conformational change by setting a threshold on the TM-score\nbetween the bound and unbound state (Fig. EV4B). Furthermore,\nsome conformation-changing binder designs exhibit higher RMSD\nand RMSF in MD simulations of the monomeric state compared to\nthe complex state (Appendix Fig. S2B). This indicates a transition\nfrom a ﬂexible monomeric structure to a more rigid complex\nstructure. While these design tasks yielded a much lower\ncomputational success rate, this is to be expected as the design\nproblem is more constrained. This demonstrates theﬂexibility of\nour method, which allows for machine learning-based multi-state\nprotein design.\nFigure 4.

Upon\nbacteriophage infection, RcaT toxins are activated and inhibit\nbacterial growth to stop viral proliferation in infected cells, and\nultimately spread to the population (Bobonis et al,2022).\nThe RcaT family of toxins provides an essentially ideal test-bed\nfor inhibitor design, as it comes with a variety of natural inhibitors\nand a readily interpretable growth-based assay for inhibitor\nscreening (Bobonis et al,2022). We designed binders to the active\nsite (blue) of Salmonella enterica-derived RcaT-Sen2 (72 designs,\nAppendix Table S1) and bispeciﬁc binders for RcaT-Sen2 and its\nhomolog RcaT-Eco1 in E. coli (16 designs, Appendix Table S1).\nCurrently, only the structure of RcaT-Eco1 has been experi-\nmentally determined (Wang et al, 2022; Carabias et al, 2024). In\ncontrast, no experimental structures exist for RcaT-Sen2 and other\nRcaT homologues. Therefore, we used an AF-predicted structure as\nthe basis for our designs. We assessed the level of RcaT inhibition\nof our designs by measuringE. coli colony growth in the presence\nof both RcaT and our designed inhibitors (Fig.7A; see Methods).\nExperimental measurements of RcaT inhibitor activity revealed that\n19.3% of designs (17/88 total, 16/72 or 22.2% of RcaT-Sen2 designs,\n13/61 or 21% at 50 AA, 5/11 or 45% at 100 AA; 1/16 or 6.2% of\nRcaT-Sen2/RcaT-Eco1 bispeci ﬁc designs) signi ﬁcantly inhibit\nRcaT-Sen2 relative to a non-inhibiting control in vivo (Fig.7B,C;\nAppendix Table S1, Appendix Fig. S3). Some designed binders\n(5.7%, 5/88, Appendix Table S1) inhibit RcaT-Sen2 even at leaky\nlevels, without induction, suggesting that those are strong binders.\nFurthermore, a subset of designed binders also inhibit the activity\nof RcaT-Eco9 — a homolog of RcaT-Sen2 — in vivo (Fig. 7C;\nAppendix Table S1), showing that our method can yield robust,\nbroad-spectrum inhibitors for closely related proteins.\nWhile our experimental approach allows us to measure inhibitor\nactivity, we note it does not take into account stability and\nexpression levels of our designs.Furthermore, a subset of designs\n(29/88, 32%) exhibit signs of toxicity, which results in lower\nmeasured inhibitor activity.\nTo assess how our computational measures of design success\nrelate to experimental success, wecompared experimental blocker\nactivity for 50 amino acid designs with scRMSD < 1.0 Å and those\nFigure 5.

This comparison showed a signi ﬁcantly\nlarger mean inhibitor activity for low scRMSD designs (t-test,\np = 0.0048, Fig.7D), indicating that AF scRMSD is a meaningful\nmeasure for selecting successful designs. In addition, experimen-\ntally successful binders displayed low scRMSD and ipAE, consistent\nwith predicted binding (Fig.7E), as well as low RMSF in molecular\ndynamics simulations (Fig. 7E, inset). Overall, these systematic\nvalidation experiments verify, at the phenotypic level, that our\npipeline is capable of designing and selecting functional protein\nbinders.\nBiophysical characterization of RcaT-Sen2 inhibitors\nTo check if our active inhibitor designs can be expressed in a soluble\nway and adopt the expected tertiary structure, we produced the 11\ndesigns with the highest normalized inhibitor activity inE. coli.W e\nwere able to overexpress and purify 7/11 designs (Appendix Fig. S4A).\nOf these 7 designs, initial circular dichroism (CD) experiments\nindicated that one was likely unfolded in the absence of RcaT-Sen2.

We found that the secondary structure compositions of all 6\ndesigns were similar to the predicted ones. In addition, we performed\nsize exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering\n(SEC-MALS) measurements, to assess the oligomeric state of designs in\nthe absence of a target, and check for possible aggregation (Appendix\nFig. S5A,B). We found that none of the tested designs showed\naggregation, and all 50 amino acid designs showed molecular weights\nconsistent with the presence of dimers, while the 100-amino-acid\ndesign tested (100aa_3_1) was consistent with a monomer (Appendix\nFig. S5B).\nFigure 7.

In the presence of active RcaT-Sen2 and\nabsence of an active blocker (or presence of GFP negative control), lowered or ablated growth ofE. colicolonies is expected (centre).

NMR structure determination of 100aa_3_1 resulted\nin an ensemble closely matching the designed structure for residues 25\nto 100 (Fig.7F). Residues 1 to 24 corresponding to the N-terminus of\n100aa_3_1 showed comparatively low pLDDT in the range between\n50 and 70 in the designed structure and were determined to be highly\nﬂexible in the NMR ensemble (Fig.7F). However, the C-terminal part\nof 100aa_3_1, which was designed to be in contact with the RcaT-Sen2\nactive site, was reproduced by the ensemble with RMSDs in the range\nof 1.45 to 2.01 Å. The ﬁrst 15 residues of cpx-50-nr2-run_5_0\nexhibited conformational exchange indicative of ﬂexibility in the\nmillisecond timescale, which precludes determination of a structural\nensemble (Kleckner and Foster, 2011). However, the secondary\nstructure obtained from NMR chemical shifts largely matches the\nprediction (Fig. 7G). In addition, we could verify the relative\nplacement of β-strands in the designed structure (Appendix Fig.\nS6A), as well as inter-monomer contacts in the predicted dimer using\nlong-range NOEs (Appendix Fig. S6B). This indicates that the\nstructure of these designs at ambient temperature is indeed close to\nthe structure generated by AD.\nDiscussion\nTo summarise, we have developed a hybrid hallucination-diffusion\napproach for protein design with the versatility to enable complex,\nnon-standard design tasks without the need for model re-training\nor ﬁne tuning. Our approach compares well with diffusion models\non standard tasks such as de novo monomer and oligomer design\nas well as the design of potent site-speciﬁc protein binders in vivo.\nIn addition to this, it also enables multi-state protein design\nincluding generating proteins predicted to bind two related targets\nas well as design of proteins that are predicted to change\nconformation upon binding, which has not previously been realised\nby machine learning-based protein design methods without the use\nof manually designed blueprints (Praetorius et al,2023).\nWe showed competitive performance of our method on\ncomputational protein design benchmarks and demonstrated its\nreal-world applicability by designing in vivo active inhibitors to a\nfamily of bacterial phage defense proteins with previously-\nunknown structure. For the top inhibitor designs, we additionally\nveriﬁed folding and structure using CD as well as NMR structure\ndetermination. Our work is theﬁrst to demonstrate de novo design\nof phage defense inhibitors at this scale. Future work on de novo\ndesign of anti-phage defense proteins could help engineer phages\nthat are resistant to multiple defense systems, facilitating future\nphage therapy applications.\nWhile solely diffusion-based methods for protein design are\navailable (Watson et al, 2023; Frank et al, 2024), our method is\nsufﬁciently ﬂexible to design proteins according to any ﬁtness\nfunction. Thus, we show that hallucination-based protein design\nmethods can compete with, and provide an advantage over\ngenerative models for protein de sign. Future improvements in\nsingle-sequence prediction accuracy and speed of protein structure\npredictors are expected to have a direct impact on hallucination-\nbased protein design. As such, our method will likely beneﬁtf r o m\nt h e s ef u t u r ed e v e l o p m e n t s .\nDespite the versatility of our method it also inherits the primary\nchallenge of hallucination-based approaches — namely scaling\npoorly to larger proteins. This is in part due to the OðN\n3Þ\ncomplexity of AlphaFold and, further, due to the number of\niterations required to ﬁnd high- ﬁtness sequences for larger\np r o t e i n s .L a r g e rp r o t e i n sr e q u i r eb o t hah i g h e rn u m b e ro fi t e r a t i o n s\nto design and take more time per iteration, leading to even less\noptimal scaling behaviour. Therefore, future work could include\naccelerating protein structure generation by using lighter-weight\nstructure predictors, more powe rful optimisation algorithms or\ndeveloping ﬁtness-guided generative models to improve structure\ngeneration while maintaining ﬂexibility. However, even with these\ncomputational limitations, our method is capable of designing\nsmall proteins with reasonable computational cost. Similar to other\ncomputational approaches to binder design (Watson et al, 2023;\nPacesa et al, 2024), our method relies on manual target site\nselection and target cropping to reduce computational cost by\nreducing the total number of predicted amino acids. While such\napproaches have been successful thus far, manual target site\nselection and cropping has the potential to introduce design errors.\nTherefore, future work developing automated target site selection\nand cropping procedures could improve computational binder\ndesign methods. In addition, while we were able to demonstrate the\ndesign of in vivo active binders for two members of the RcaT family\nof bacterial toxins, it remains to be seen how well our method\ntransfers to other target proteins. Similarly, this study is limited by\nthe lack of high-throughput structural validation of generated\nstructures, which we plan to address in future work.\nTaken together, AlphaDesign enables rapid de novo design of\nsmall ordered protein binders while retaining the ﬂexibility of\noptimizing arbitrary ﬁtness functions. This way, AlphaDesign can\nbe adapted to non-standard design tasks including multi-target and\nmulti-state binder design.\nMethods\nReagents and tools table\nReagent/Resource Reference or Source\nIdentiﬁer or Catalog\nNumber\nExperimental models\nE. coli DATC DSMZ DSM 116187\nE. coli BW25113 DSMZ DSM 27469\nE. coli BW25113 pir116 Typas Group EMBL\nE. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus\nRIL\nAgilent / Stratagene Cat #230245\nRecombinant DNA\npJB158 Addgene Cat #202601\npJB37 Addgene Cat #202602\npJB117 Typas Group EMBL\npETM11-SUMO3eGFP EMBL PEPCF\nAntibodies\nOligonucleotides and other sequence-based reagents\nPrimer JB563 (5′-\naatgagggcatcgttcccac-3′)\nTypas Group EMBL\nMichael A Jendrusch et al Molecular Systems Biology\n© The Author(s) Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 1175\nReagent/Resource Reference or Source\nIdentiﬁer or Catalog\nNumber\nPrimer JB564 (5′-\ncgcatacgctacttgcattacag-3′)\nTypas Group EMBL\nPrimer JB565 (5′-\ncagtgataacggaccgcg-3′)\nTypas Group EMBL\nPrimer JB566 (5′-\nccgagcgttctgaacaaatc-3′)\nTypas Group EMBL\nChemicals, Enzymes and other reagents\nTryptone Sigma-Aldrich Cat #T7293-1KG\nBacto yeast extract Gibco Cat #212750\nSodium chloride NaCl Merck Cat #1.06404.1000\nGlucose Merck Cat #1.04074.1000\nLactose Merck Cat #1.07657.1000\nMagnesium sulfate\nheptahydrate MgSO\n4.7H2O\nMerck Cat #1.05886.1000\nDAP Sigma-Aldrich Cat #D1377\nSpectinomycin Sigma-Aldrich Cat #S9007\nTetracycline hydrochloride Sigma-Aldrich Cat #C4881\nKanamycin Roth Cat #T832.2\nChloramphenicol BioChemica Cat #A1806,0025\nIPTG Carl Roth Cat #2316.3\nl-Arabinose Sigma-Aldrich Cat #A3256\nGentamicin Sigma-Aldrich Cat #G1264\nBsaI-HF-V2 NEB Cat #R3733L\nGoTaq Green 2x master mix Promega Cat #M7122\nGlycerol VWR Cat #1.04091.1000\nLysozyme Sigma-Aldrich Cat #62971\nSmNuclease EMBL PEPCF\ncOmplete™, EDTA-free\nProtease Inhibitor Cocktail\nSigma-Aldrich Cat #COEDTAF-RO\nTris (Trizma base) Sigma Cat #T1503\nImidazole Merck Cat #1.04716.1000\nD\n2O Sigma-Aldrich Cat #151882\nAmmonium chloride (15N) Merck Cat #299251\nD-glucose (13C) Merck Cat #389374\nNi-NTA beads Qiagen Cat #30210\nPoly-Prep Chromatography\nColumns\nBio-Rad Cat #7311550\nHis\n6-tagged SenP2 protease EMBL PEPCF\n1 mL Protino Ni-NTA column Macherey-Nagel Cat #745410.5\nSpectra/Por 3 Dialysis\nTubing, 3.5 kD MWCO\nRepligen Cat #132720\nAmicon Ultra-4 3 kDa\nMWCO centrifugal ﬁlter\nMerck-Millipore Cat #UFC800308\nSuperdex™ 75 10/300 GL\ncolumn\nCytiva Cat #17517401\nSuperdex™ 200 Increase 5/\n150 GL gel-ﬁltration column\nCytiva Cat #28-9909-45\nNMR tubes Norell Cat #ST500-7\nReagent/Resource Reference or Source\nIdentiﬁer or Catalog\nNumber\nSoftware\nAdobe Photoshop 2023\n(v.24.7.0)\nAdobe\nR v.4.3.1\nAstra 8.2.0 Wyatt Technology\nNMPipe Delaglio et al, 1995\nCara http://cara.nmr.ch\nNMRViewJ Keller, 2005;\nJohnson and Blevins,\n1994\nCYANA 3.98.15 Güntert, 2009\nTALOS+ Shen et al,2009\nAMBER https://\nambermd.org/\nRStudio v. 2023.06.1+ 524 Posit\nOther\nSinger pinning robot Rotor\nHDA\nSinger Instruments Cat #ROT-001\nHumid incubator MCO-80IC Sanyo MCO-80IC\nPlusPlates Singer Instruments Cat #PLU-003\nCanon EOS Rebel T3i\ncamera\nCanon\nMicroﬂuidizer M-110L\nFluidProcessor\nMicroﬂuidics\nOptima L-100 XP\nUltracentrifuge\nBeckman Coulter\nӒKTA Pure chromatography\nsystem\nCytiva\nJasco J-815 CD\nspectrophotometer\nJasco\nAgilent 1260 Inﬁnity II HPLC\nsystem\nAgilent\nMiniDAWN and Optilab Wyatt Technology\nBruker Avance III HD\n700 MHz\nBruker\nBruker Avance III HD\n900 MHz\nBruker\nBruker Avance III 600 MHz Bruker\nMethods and protocols\nWe frame protein design as a search problem to ﬁnd the set of\nprotein sequences for which a certain ﬁtness function exceeds a\nﬁxed threshold. To take into account both sequence properties and\nall-atom protein structure, we integrate AF (Jumper et al, 2021)\ninto our ﬁtness functions to provide high-quality structure\nprediction and measures of prediction con ﬁdence. We combine\nthis with state-of-the-art validation using Rosetta ab initio structure\nprediction (Leaver-Fay et al, 2011) and all-atom molecular\ndynamics simulations.\nMolecular Systems Biology Michael A Jendrusch et al\n1176 Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 © The Author(s)\nAlphaDesign pipeline\nThe AlphaDesign pipeline consi sts of three separate steps:\nCandidate structure generation, sequence redesign and computa-\ntional validation. In theﬁrst step, we use an evolutionary algorithm\n(Sinai et al, 2020) to identify sequences with high-conﬁdence AF\npredictions conforming to a design goal (Methods, “Candidate\nstructure generation with AlphaFold”;F i g .1, red). In the second\nstep, we use an autoregressive diffusion model (ADM) (Hooge-\nboom et al, 2022) to generate optimised sequences for each\ncandidate structure (Sec. 4.2.5; Fig.1, blue) and discard candidates\nfor which no optimised sequence can be found (Methods,\n“Sequence redesign with autoregressive diffusion models”). Finally,\nwe predict the structures of these optimised sequences using AF\nand ESMfold, discarding designs with high RMSD to the original\ndesign, or low pLDDT (Methods, “Computational benchmarks”).\nThe remaining candidates are codon-optimised and can be ordered\nas gene fragments for experimental validation (Methods, “Codon\noptimisation”).\nFitness functions for protein design tasks\nIn order to frame protein sequences and structure design as a\nsearch or optimisation problem, we need to specify a ﬁtness\nfunction which encapsulates the end goal of a given design task.\nAlphaFold pLDDT and pAE for a prediction correlate with protein\nstructure quality (Mirdita et al, 2022). Therefore, optimising for\nhigh pLDDT and low pAE should provide a good prior for\ngenerating native-like protein structures. Interface pAE (ipAE)\ncorrelates with the probability of protein –protein interaction\n(Evans et al,2021). Optimising for low ipAE between two protein\nmonomers allows us to design protein –protein interactions. In\ncombination with additional conﬁdence and geometric constraints\n(Table 2), this allows us to specify ﬁt n e s sf u n c t i o n sf o rd en o v o\nmonomer, oligomer ( Ldenovo ) as well as targeted protein binder\ndesign (Lbinder ). We can also search for sequences for which AF\npredicts different monomeric and oligomeric states by designing a\ncorresponding ﬁt n e s sf u n c t i o n(Lchange ).\nCandidate structure generation with AlphaFold\nWe repurpose AF (Jumper et al, 2021) as a generative model of\nprotein backbones. By searching for amino acid sequences with\nhigh-conﬁdence predictions we can ext ract native-like protein\nstructures from AlphaFold (Fig. 1A). To automate this search we\nuse an evolutionary algorithm to continually update a pool of\namino acid sequences. The sequence pool is initialised uniformly at\nrandom from a set of allowed amino acids. In this study, we exclude\ncysteine as it could interfere with protein expression (Wicky et al,\n2022; Frank et al, 2024; Kong and Guo, 2014). AF predicts\nstructures and conﬁdence scores (predicted local distance differ-\nence test, pLDDT; predicted aligned error, pAE) for these\nsequences. We then combine these conﬁdence scores into aﬁtness\nfunction with additional constraints on protein sequence, structure\nand function (Fig. 1B). The evolutionary algorithm then updates\nthe sequence pool. In this work, we use an evolutionary algorithm\nfollowing (Sinai et al, 2020)t oo p t i m i s et h eﬁtness function.\nHowever, other gradient-free or gradient-based optimisers can be\nsubstituted as desired. Throughout optimisation a protein changes\nits structure and both local and global con ﬁdence measures\nincrease. This process is repeated until a sequence in the pool\nreaches a user-deﬁned ﬁtness threshold (see Supporting Methods,\n“AlphaDesign design loop pseudocode ”). The speci ﬁed ﬁtness\nfunction (Fig. 1B) dictates the structure and function of protein\nstructures generated this way.\nFixing protein structures using templates\nTo enable binder design without requiring MSA inputs for target\nproteins, we provide AF with a template structure for proteins\nwhose structure should remainﬁxed throughout the design process.\nTo reduce computation as much as possible, we may crop the\nstructures of target proteins around the desired binding site. We\nthen feed this cropped sequence and structure as a template into\nAF. This keeps computational cost ﬁxed for binder design to\narbitrary size proteins.\nAutoregressive diffusion model training\nTo generate improved sequences forstructure candidates recovered\nfrom AF, we trained a conditional autoregressive diffusion model\n(ADM) (Hoogeboom et al, 2022) on protein sequences and\nstructures in the PDB. Conditional ADM learn to recover the\namino acid sequence of a protein given its structure by optimising\nthe following loss (Hoogeboom et al,2022):\nL\nADM ðθÞ :¼ Es;x/C24 pdata ;s0 /C24 pmask ðs0jsÞ½log pθðsjs0; xÞ/C138\nwhere pθ denotes the output distribution of protein sequences from\nthe model, pD denotes the data distribution, s denotes a protein\nsequence, x a protein structure andpmaskðs0jsÞ denotes a distribution\nof masked amino acid sequencess0 conditioned on a ground-truth\nsequence s.W ec h o s epmask to be the uniform distribution over\nmasked sequences. That is, the number of masked positions was\nsampled uniformly at random as were the masked positions. We\nparameterised p\nθðsjs0; xÞ as a productQ\nipθðsijs0; xÞ of independent\ncategorical distributions for each amino acid as customary for\nmasked sequence modelling (Hoogeboom et al,2022).\nWe based the architecture of our ADM on the message-passing\nblocks of ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al,2022). Our model consists\nof 6 MPNN blocks with 30 nearest neighbours, 128 node features\nand 128 edge features. Before passing the protein backbone to the\nMPNN, we add Gaussian noise with meanμ ¼ 0:0a n ds t a n d a r d\ndeviation σ ¼ 0:3 Å to all atom positions. In contrast to\nProteinMPNN, node features were initialised with the embedding\nof the masked amino acid sequence and the model was trained to\ndirectly predict independent prob ability distributions for each\nmasked amino acid. This made it easier to implement complex\ndependencies between amino acids in homooligomers or repeat\nproteins during sampling.\nThe training set consisted of all protein structures from the PDB\n(Berman et al,2000) with a resolution better than 3.5 Å deposited\nbefore January 2021. Validation and test sets were drawn from\nstructures in the PDB deposited before January 2022 with less than\n10% sequence identity to the training set. The training set was\nclustered at 40% sequence identity. Structures were sampled from\nthe training set with a probability inversely proportional to cluster\nMichael A Jendrusch et al Molecular Systems Biology\n© The Author(s) Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 1177\nsize without replacement. Structures were accumulated into batches\nuntil adding an additional chain would increase the batch size\nbeyond 10k amino acids. Batches were zero-padded to 10k amino\nacids and padded amino acids were masked out during training.\nFor simplicity of implementation the loss was averaged over all\nmasked amino acids in a batch, as opposed to averaging\nper sequence.\nThe model was trained for 250k steps using Adam (Kingma and\nBa, 2014)w i t hh y p e r p a r a m e t e r sβ\n1 = 0.9 andβ2 = 0.98 and linear\nwarm-up to a ﬁnal learning rate of 1e−3o v e rt h eﬁrst 10k steps.\nThese hyperparameters were chosen following ProteinMPNN.\nDuring training, overﬁtting was assessed by monitoring perplexity\nof the model on the validation set. As we did not observe an\nincrease in the validation loss across the entire 250k steps of mode\ntraining, we selected theﬁnal checkpoint for further evaluation.\nSequence redesign with autoregressive diffusion models\nWe redesign sequences of candidate structures using an ADM\nstarting from a fully masked sequence. For binder design, only the\nsequence of the binder was masked, while the target sequence was\nkept intact. At each step of redesign, we sample a random masked\nposition, compute the probability distribution at that position, set\nthe probability of forbidden amino acids to zero, re-scale it by an\ninverse temperature of 10 and sample an amino acid. If the sampled\nposition has any sequence constraints associated with it, we also set\nthe sampled amino acid at all tied positions. We repeat this process\nuntil no more masked amino acids remain. This way, we sampled\n100 sequences per candidate structure and ranked them by their\nlikelihood under the model (see Supporting Methods, “Sequence\ndesign pseudocode”).\nComputational benchmarks\nTo computationally verify the folding of designed proteins, we\npredict their structures using AlphaFold and ESMfold in single-\nsequence mode with 4 recycling iterations. We compute the mean\npLDDT, pAE,i n t e r f a c epAE (ipAE)a n dpTM for those structures.\nWe then compute the self-consistent RMSD (scRMSD) and self-\nconsistent TM-score (scTM) between the original designed\nstructure (using AlphaDesign or RFDiffusion) and predicted\nstructures of the corresponding designed sequences. For binder\ndesign, we input a template for the target protein to AlphaDesign,\nand initialise recycling with the designed structure of the complex\nfollowing (Bennett et al,2022). For multi-state designs (conforma-\ntion-changing proteins, bispeci ﬁc binders), we run these bench-\nmarks once for each state (bound/unbound, binding target 1/2) and\ncombine the results. In all benchmarks involving sequence rede-\nsign, we report results for the bestredesigned sequence, selected by\nﬁrst applying all thresholds for design success and then sorting by\nscRMSD. For comparison with RFDiffusion (Fig. 1E,F, bottom\nrow), we use 8 redesigned sequences (randomly sampled from 100)\nto be consistent with the evaluation reported in (Watson et al,\n2023). For comparison between raw and redesigned sequences\n(Fig. 1E,F, top row) we use 32 redesigned sequences (randomly\nsampled from 100). For protein binder design, we use 100 random\nredesigned sequences, as sequence generation and benchmarking\nare generally cheap compared to candidate generation. Unless\nstated otherwise, we consider a designed protein computationally\nsuccessful if it fulﬁls pLDDT>70, scRMSD<2 Å. For binder design,\nwe additionally consider a stricter threshold of pLDDT>80,\nscRMSD<1Å a n dipAE<10 Å following (Bennett et al, 2022).\nBenchmark code is available at github.com/mjendrusch/\nnovobench.\nADM benchmarks\nTo evaluate the suitability of our autoregressive diffusion model for\nde novo protein design, we generated 32 sequences for each\nm o n o m e ri nas e to f1 6 8 8o fm o n o m e r so f5 0t o3 0 0a m i n oa c i d s\ngenerated by optimisingLdenovo (Table 2), evaluated their scRMSD,\npLDDT and success rate using AlphaFold and compared the results\nto 32 sequences generated using ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al,\n2022).\nRFDiffusion benchmark protein generation\nTo compare our method to RFDiffusion, we generated monomers\nof sizes 50 AA, 100 AA, 200 AA and 300 AA as well as\nheterodimers with 50 AA monomers, homooligomers (dimers to\ntetramers) with 50 AA monomers. For AlphaDesign, we generate\ncandidate structures over 4 days on two Nvidia 3090 GPUs,\nresulting in 1688 total monomers and 3010 total oligomers. We\nthen generated 100 sequences for each structure using our ADM.\nFor comparison with RFDiffusion, we selected 8 of these redesigned\nsequences uniformly at random. F or RFDiffusion, we generated\n500 structures for each size of monomers and 500 structures for\neach type of oligomers. Monomers and heterodimers were\ngenerated using RFDiffusion’s default settings, while homodimers\nwere generated with cyclic symmetry enabled. Following (Watson\net al, 2023), we then sampled 8 sequences for each generated\nstructure using ProteinMPNN (Dauparas et al, 2022). For all\ngenerated structures and their corresponding sequences, we then\npredicted pLDDT, pAE and scRMSD as described above. Designed\nsequences, structures and benchmark scores were deposited on\nZenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15208893 ).\nAlphaDesign sample size\nThe number of backbones generated in all benchmarks for\nAlphaDesign depends on the difﬁculty of the protein design task.\nMore complex design tasks (e.g. multi-state design) as well as\ndesign tasks result in a lower number of generated backbones.\nS i m i l a r l y ,al a r g e rn u m b e ro fa m i n oa c i d st od e s i g nw i l lr e s u l ti na\nsmaller number of backbones generated.

We kept the highest-likelihood sequence and\ndiscard candidates with 1\nN\nPN\ni log pθðsijxÞ< /C0 0:1 nats. We re-\npredicted candidate structures with AF at 4 recycling steps,\ndiscarding candidates with pLDDT /C1 pTM<0:5. We predicted\nsequence-based candidate solubility scores with CamSol using bulk\nsequence prediction on the CamSol Intrinsic webserver at pH = 7\n(Sormanni et al, 2015). We then discarded candidates with score\n<1. We codon-optimised the remaining candidates for expression\nin E. coli. After RcaT binders were designed and benchmarked on\ncropped RcaT structures, we used AlphaFold to predict the\nstructure of the complex between each designed RcaT binder and\nthe full RcaT-Sen2 by providing a template for the cropped\nstructure, as well as a template for the full RcaT-Sen2 structure that\nwe previously predicted. We used these un-cropped complexes for\nall downstream molecular dynamics analyses.\nCodon optimisation\nDesigned amino sequences were reverse-translated and codon\noptimised using the DNA Chisel package (Zulkower et al,2020).\nGC content was constrained to lie between 35% and 65%, sequences\ncontaining pentanucleotide repeats, rare codons and hairpin-\nforming sub-sequences were excluded. Sequences were optimised\nto match native E. coli codon usage and reduce the amount of\nrepeat codons.\nBacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions\nBacteria were grown in lysogeny broth (LB; 10 g/L of tryptone,\n5 g/L of yeast extract, and 5 g/L of NaCl) or on LB Lennox agar\n(2%) plates. E. coli strain DATC (DAP-Auxotroph Transformation\nConjugation) (DSM 116187) was used to conjugate the designed\nblockers cloned in the pJB158 plasmid (Addgene ID 202601) into\nthe BW25113 pir-116 strain transformed with plasmid pJB37 or\npJB117 (Bobonis et al,2022). BW25113pir-116 was constructed by\nreplacing the β-glucoside locus ( bgl)w i t hpir-116 in E. coli\nBW25113 (DSM 27469), which allows the R6K-containing\npJB158 vectors to replicate in high-copy numbers (~250 copies/\ncell) (Metcalf et al,1994). Antibiotics, auxotrophies, and inducers\nused were Spectinomycin (100 μg/mL), Tetracycline (10 μg/mL),\nGentamicin (10μg/mL), Diaminopimelic acid (0.3 mM), Isopropyl-\nβ-D-thiogalactopyranosid (0.1 mM), and L-arabinose (0.2%).\nConstruction of the genetic library of RcaT blockers\nDNA sequences encoding the designed RcaT-Sen2 blockers were\nsynthesized (IDT) and cloned through Golden Gate Assembly\n(Engler, 2008) using BsaI-HF-V2 (NEB) into the IPTG-inducible\npJB158 vector (Addgene: #202601). Each sequence contained Golden\nGate-compatible overhangs at the 5′ (5′-gcgagggtctcggcat-3′) and 3′\n(5′-taagcgagacccagatc-3′) end. Golden gate reactions were performed\nin 96-well PCR plates in a thermocycler (30 cycles of 2 min at 37 °C\nand 5 min at 16 °C, followed by 10 min at 60 °C, and 20 min at 80 °C).\nChemically competentE. coliDATC cells were transformed with 5μL\nof Golden Gate reactions.

Transformants carrying correctly-sized inserts (as judged by\ncolony PCR) were validated by Sanger sequencing using primers\nJB565 (5′-cagtgataacggaccgcg-3′) and JB566 (5′-ccgagcgttctgaacaaatc-\n3′), arrayed into 96-well plates, grown overnight in LB with 0.3 mM\nDAP and 10μg/mL tetracycline and frozen at−80 °C after adding\nglycerol (12.5% ﬁnal concentration). Per blocker construct, two\nseparate transformants were selected (biological replicates).\nToxin-inhibition conjugation (TIC) procedure\nThe TIC assay was done as described in Bobonis et al ( 2024).\nBrieﬂy, TIC is a high-throughput genetics screen to identify\ninhibitors of TA systems. Arrayed donor libraries carrying\nmobilizable gene-overexpression plasmids (the designed RcaT-\nSen2 blockers) were conjugated on recipient bacteria expressing a\ntoxin plasmid (RcaT-Sen2) and colonyﬁt n e s si sm e a s u r e do np l a t e\nin presence/absence of the inducers. TA inhibitors should increase\nstrain ﬁtness in the presence of the toxin, by inhibiting the toxin.\nThe TIC assay was adapted from this protocol (Bobonis et al,2024).\nBy using the Singer ROTOR pinning robot, two 96-well glycerol\nstock plates containing the blocker library in the E. coli DATC\ndonor strain (two biological replicates) were pinned from liquid\nglycerol stocks to LB DAP Tetracycline plates (96-density long-pin\nSinger RePads), re-arrayed into 384-colony arrays (leading to two\nbiological with two technical replicates of the library in one 384-\narray), and grown overnight at 37 °C in a humid incubator. The\nconjugation recipient strain (E. coliBW25113 pir-116) carrying the\np-RcaT-Sen2 plasmid (pJB37) or the p-RcaT-Eco9 plasmid\n(pJB117) was grown overnight in LB spectinomycin in three\nbiological replicates, and 200μL of culture (OD 595 nm = 0.5) was\nspread on LB DAP Singer plates using glass beads. Plates with\nrecipient lawns were incubated in a non-humid incubator at 37 °C\nfor 1 h to dry. Afterwards, the blocker library was pinned on top of\nthe recipient lawns in three biological replicates, using 384 short-\npin Singer RePads. Plates were incubated for 8 h in a humid\nincubator at 37 °C for conjugation. Next, cells were pinned from the\nc o n j u g a t i o np l a t e so n t oL Bp l a t e sw i t h o u tD A Pa n dw i t h\nSpectinomycin and Tetracycline using 384 short-pin Singer RePads,\nto select for transconjugants which carry both recipient (pJB37 or\npJB117) and donor (blocker libraries) plasmids. Transconjugants\nwere grown for 16 h at 37 °C before being pinned again on double\nselection plates for another round of selection. Plates from the\nsecond round of double selection were incubated for 8–9ha t3 7° C ,\nand then each biological replicate was pinned using 384 short-pin\nSinger RePads into double-selection LB experimental plates.\nExperimental plates contained either no inducer, only arabinose\n(to induce toxin expression), only IPTG (to induce blocker\nexpression), or both inducers.\nExperimental plates were incubated for 10 h at 37 °C, and\nimaged using a Canon EOS Rebel T3i camera (S&P robotics).\nTIC data analysis\nBacterial colony opacity for each strain was quantiﬁed using the\nimage analysis tool Iris (Kritikos et al,2017) ,a n du s e da sap r o x y\nfor bacterial ﬁtness. To increase background contrast for colony\ndetection by Iris, plate images were converted to grayscale and\ncontrast enhanced by a value of 12 on Adobe Photoshop 2023\n(v.24.7.0). Colonies with opacity equal to 0 were considered\npinning misses and were removed. As previously reported\n(Baryshnikova et al, 2010), colonies on the outermost plate edge\nhad systematically higher opacity values, which were multiplica-\ntively corrected to the median opacity of the rest of the plate. To\ndetermine the effect of each blocker in each condition as compared\nto non-blocking GFP controls and to compare between same-\ncondition plates, the colony opacity of each blocker-carrying strain\nwas divided per plate by the mean opacity of the GFP-carrying\ncontrols ( n = 32), deriving normalised ﬁt n e s sv a l u e sf o re a c h\nblocker (n = 12), which were then averaged across the two technical\nreplicates. Each blocker ’s effect was then quantiﬁed as the ratio\nbetween ﬁtness values upon toxin and blocker induction (double-\ninduction plates with arabinose and IPTG) and upon toxin-only\ninduction (arabinose only). Signi ﬁcance was assessed through a\ntwo-sided Welch ’s t-test comparing the effect of each blocker\n(n =6 ) a n d G F P (n = 16). A cumulative effect size was derived for\neach blocker as the mean of its effect divided by the effect of GFP,\ndistinguishing blockers from non-blockers, i.e. neutral (effect size =\n1) or aggravating the toxin effect (effect size < 1). Leaky blockers\nwere deﬁned asﬁtness upon toxin-only expression higher than two\nstandard deviations from the mean of GFP controls in the same\ncondition. Toxic blockers were deﬁned asﬁtness upon blocker-only\nexpression lower than two standard deviations of GFP controls in\nthe same condition. Hits fulﬁlled a signiﬁcance cutoff (p-value <\n0.01) and an effect size cutoff of 1.1 for RcaT-Sen2 (1.3 for RcaT-\nEco9). Data analysis was implemented with R v.4.3.1 (R Core Team,\n2020) and RStudio v. 2023.06.1+ 524 (Posit Team,2023). Normal-\nized opacity measurements can be found in Appendix Fig. S6.\nSmall-scale expression and puriﬁcation\nE. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene) were freshly\ntransformed with expression plasmids (pETM11-SUMO3eGFP\n(Scholz et al, 2013)) encoding His\n6 and Sumo3-tagged, codon-\noptimized, constructs for the top 11 RcaT-Sen2 inhibitor designs by\nnormalized blocker activity. 50 mL cultures were grown in TB-FB\nmedium supplemented with 2 mM MgSO\n4, 0.05% glucose, 1.5%\nlactose, 30μg/mL Kanamycin and 34μg/mL Chloramphenicol. The\nE. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C until the OD600 0.6–0.8, after\nwhich the temperature was reduced to 18 °C. After overnight\nexpression at 18 °C, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation\n(10 min, 3200 ×g, 4 °C) and the pellets wereﬂash-frozen in liquid\nnitrogen and stored at −80 °C until the start of the protein\npuriﬁcation.\nThe cell pellets were resuspended in 4 mL lysis buffer (50 mM\nTris pH 7.5; 1 M NaCl; 20 mM imidazole; 5 mM; 1 mg/mL\nlysozyme; 25 ng/μL SmNuclease; cOmplete™,E D T A - f r e eP r o t e a s e\nInhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). Cells were lysed by 4\nconsecutive freeze-thaw cycles, followed by centrifugation\n(15 min, 17,000 ×g, 4 °C). After centrifugation, the supernatant\nwas incubated with 125 μL Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) pre-\nequilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5; 300 mM NaCl;\n10% glycerol; 20 mM imidazole) and the samples were rotated for\n1 h at 4 °C. After this binding step, the Ni-NTA beads were\ntransferred into an empty Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad), washed 3\ntimes with 4 mL wash buffer and eluted with 300μL elution buffer\nMolecular Systems Biology Michael A Jendrusch et al\n1180 Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 © The Author(s)\n( 5 0 m MT r i sp H7 . 5 ;3 0 0 m MN a C l ;1 0 %g l y c e r o l ;2 5 0 m M\nimidazole). The total lysate, the soluble fraction after centrifugation\nand the elution fraction of all samples were analysed via SDS-\nPAGE.\nTo assess solubility in the absence of the Sumo3-tag, elution\nfractions were subsequently incubated with 5 μgo f His\n6-tagged\nSenP2 protease for 2 h on ice. After the digest, samples were\ncentrifuged (15 min, 17,000 × g, 4 °C) and the supernatants\nanalysed via SDS-PAGE.\nExpression and puriﬁcation for downstream analyses\nLarger scale protein production experiments were performed for\nconstructs that could be successfully expressed and puriﬁed in a\nsoluble way in the small scale tests (Appendix Fig. S3A). The\nexpression plasmids were again freshly transformed into E. coli\nBL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene). Precultures were\ngrown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 30μg/\nmL Kanamycin and 34 μg/mL Chloramphenicol. The next day,\n20 mL preculture was added to 1 L of\n15N M9 minimal medium\ncontaining 0.5 g15NH4Cl (water 858 mL; Na2HPO4 6.78 g; KH2PO4\n3 g; NaCl 0.5 g; 100x trace elements 10 mL; Thiamin (50 mg/mL)\n0.6 mL; glucose (20%) 20 mL; MgSO4 (1 M) 2 mL;15NH4Cl 0.5 g;\nCaCl2 (1 M) 100μL; total of 1 L) or 1 L of13C 15N M9 minimal\nmedium containing 2 g 13C-glucose and 0.5 g 15NH4Cl (water\n858 mL; Na2HPO4 6.78 g; KH2PO4 3 g; 0.5 g; 100x trace elements\n10 mL; Thiamin (50 mg/mL) 0.6 mL;13C-glucose 2 g; MgSO4 (1 M)\n2m L ;15NH4Cl 0.5 g; CaCl2 (1 M) 100μL; total of 1 L) in 5 L culture\nﬂasks. The 20 mL preculture was centrifuged (15 min, 1200 ×g)a n d\nresuspended in minimal medium before addition to the culture\nﬂasks. The expression cultures were grown at 37 °C until OD600\n0.6–0.8 and then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After induction, the\ntemperature was reduced to 20 °C for overnight cultivation. The\ncells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 5000 ×g), ﬂash-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at−20 °C until the start of the\npuriﬁcation.\nCell pellets from 1 LE. coli cultures were resuspended in 40 mL\nlysis buffer. The cells were lysed by 5 passages through a\nmicroﬂuidizer device, followed by centrifugation (30 min,\n35,000 rpm, 4 °C, Ti45 rotor) in an Optima L-100 XP Ultracen-\ntrifuge (Beckman Coulter). After centrifugation, the supernatant\nwas loaded at ca. 1 mL/min on a 1 mL Protino Ni-NTA column\n(Macherey Nagel) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer using a\nperistaltic pump at 4 °C.

The total lysate (TL), the soluble fraction\nafter centrifugation (supernatant SN) and the elution fraction (Elu)\nof all samples were analysed via SDS-PAGE. As 50aa_2_14 and\n50aa_2_10 showed some precipitation in the elution fractions, the\nsamples were centrifuged (15 min, 4500 rpm, 4 °C) and the cleared\nsupernatant was used for further puriﬁcation steps.\nElution fractions containing the designed proteins were pooled\nand 333 μgo f His\n6-tagged SenP2 protease was added to each\nsample. The samples were transferred into a 3.5 kDa MWCO\nSpectra/Por3 Dialysis Membrane and dialysed overnight at 4 °C\nagainst 1 L dialysis buffer (same as wash buffer). The next day, all\nsamples were removed from the 3.5 kDa MWCO Spectra/Por3\nDialysis Membrane and loaded again onto a 1 mL Protino Ni-NTA\ncolumn (Macherey Nagel) at ca. 1 mL/min and 4 °C. The ﬂow\nthrough, which should contain the untagged designed proteins was\ncollected. The His\n6-tagged SenP2 protease, theHis6-Sumo3 fusion\ntag and any uncleaved fusion proteins should remain bound to the\nNi-NTA beads. The ﬂow through fractions were concentrated to\n0.5 mL in an Amicon 3 kDa MWCO centrifugalﬁlter unit (Merck\nMillipore). No protein was present in the ﬂow through of the\nAmicon concentrators.\nThe concentrated samples obtained after the reverse Ni-NTA\npuriﬁcation step were loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 size\nexclusion chromatography column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with\nSEC buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl). 0.5 mL\nelution fractions were collected and analysed via SDS-PAGE. The\ncleanest fractions for all 6 proteins were pooled, aliquoted,ﬂash-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at−80 °C.\nCircular dichroism spectroscopy\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded to analyse the\nsecondary structure of the proteins. CD spectrum of the sample\n(protein at 1 mg/mL) was recorded using a Jasco J-815 CD\nspectrophotometer using a 0.2 mm pathlength CD Quartz cuvette,\nat 20 °C, between 260 nm to 190 nm, with 10 accumulations,\nstandard sensitivity, a bandwidth of 1 nm and a data-pitch of\n0.1 nm. A buffer spectrum was ﬁrst recorded as baseline and\nsubtracted from the sample spectrum. The spectra were analysed\nusing the BeStSel server with single spectrum analysis ( https://\nbestsel.elte.hu/index.php ) (Micsonai et al,2018), with the CDSSTR\n(Johnson, 1999) method with the protein reference data 7\n(Sreerama and Woody, 2000) using the DichroWeb server\n(http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/html/process.shtml )( M i l e se ta l ,\n2022) and with the Multivariate SSE analysis of the Jasco Spectra\nManager software. A CD spectrum was calculated from the AF\nstructure prediction of the protein using the KCD software (https://\nkcd.cinvestav.mx ) (Jacinto-Méndez et al, 2024)a n dt h e\nPDBMD2CD software (https://pdbmd2cd.cryst.bbk.ac.uk )( M a v r i -\ndis and Janes,2016).\nSize exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle\nlight scattering\nA size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light\nscattering (SEC-MALS) experiment was performed to assess\naggregation and the oligomeric state of the proteins. 50 μLo f\nsample (protein at 1 mg/mL) was injected onto a Superdex 200\nIncrease 5/150 GL gel-ﬁltration column (GE Healthcare) on an\nA g i l e n t1 2 6 0I nﬁnity II HPLC system (Agilent) in 50 mM\nNaPhosphate pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaCl buffer at room temperature\nwith aﬂow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The column was coupled to a MALS\nsystem (MiniDAWN and Optilab, Wyatt Technology). Data were\nanalysed using the Astra 8.2.0 software (Wyatt Technology). The\ngeneric protein dn/dc value of 0.1850 was applied.\nNuclear magnetic resonance structure determination\nAll nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on\nBruker Avance III HD 700 MHz and 900 MHz NMR spectrometers,\nequipped with cryogenically-cooled triple-resonance probes and a\nBruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a room\ntemperature triple-resonance probe at a temperature of 298 K.\nMichael A Jendrusch et al Molecular Systems Biology\n© The Author(s) Molecular Systems BiologyVolume 21 | Issue 9 | September 2025 | 1166– 1189 1181\nFor protein resonance assignment, standard double and triple\nresonance through-bond experiments were recorded (Sattler et al,\n1999). 15Na n d13C-edited NOESY spectra (mixing time 120 ms)\nwere performed to obtain distance restraints. Apodization weighted\nsampling was used for acquisition of triple resonance spectra\n(Simon and Köstler,2019), and non-uniform sampling was applied\nfor 15N-edited NOESY spectra. NMR data were processed using\nNMPipe (Delaglio et al, 1995) or in-house routines and analysed\nwith Cara ( http://cara.nmr.ch ) or NMRViewJ (Keller, 2005;\nJohnson and Blevins, 1994). Secondary structure prediction from\nsecondary chemical shifts (C α and Cβ) was done according to\nWishart and Sykes (Wishart and Sykes, 1994) using random coil\nchemical shifts determined by Kjaergaard et al, 2011 (Kjaergaard\net al, 2011).\nFor structure calculation using torsion angle dynamics with\nCYANA 3.98.15 (Güntert, 2009) dihedral angle restraints were\nderived from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS+ (Shen et al,\n2009), and distance restraints were obtained from 15N- and\n13C-edited NOESY spectra. NOEs were initially manually and later\nautomatically assigned using the noe_assign function of CYANA\n3.98.15.\nValidation of protein design using all-atom molecular\ndynamics simulations\nDesigned binder complexes were further rigorously validated by\nperforming all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in\nexplicit solvent and analysing the corresponding properties of\nstructural ﬂexibility and internal/intramonomeric and interfacial\ncontacts. Furthermore, binding af ﬁnities were computed by\ncombining an established struct ure-based predictor (Xue et al,\n2016) with the conformational ensemble generated from the\ncorresponding MD simulations.\nThe standard AMBER forceﬁeld (ff14sb) was used to describe\nall protein parameters (Maier et al,2015). Each protein or protein\ncomplex was solvated using atomistic TIP3P water (Jorgensen et al,\n1983) with a minimum of 10 Å of padding to form a cubic periodic\nbox and then electrically neutralized with an ionic concentration of\n0.15 M NaCl that used standard ionic parameters (Joung and\nCheatham, 2008).\nA standardised minimisation, equilibration and simulation protocol\nconsisting of several stages was developed for all systems. A set of\nrestraints (RS) were applied to each system at speciﬁed stages of\nequilibration. These consisted of restraining all heavy (non-hydrogen)\natoms of the proteins. Each system was subsequently minimised across\nfour stages with 1500 steps (500 steepest-descent+ 1000 conjugate-\ngradient) of minimization applying restraints RS with different force\nconstants in each sequential stage: Stage 1: 10 kcal/mol Å\n2,S t a g e2 :\n5k c a l / m o lÅ2,S t a g e3 :1 k c a l / m o l Å2, Stage 4: unrestrained. MD\nsimulations were performed in alls u b s e q u e n ts t a g e s .T h eS H A K E\nalgorithm was employed on all atoms covalently bonded to a hydrogen\natom. A time-step of 2 fs was used. The long-range Coulomb interaction\nwas handled using a GPU implementation of the particle mesh Ewald\nsummation method (PME) (Essmann et al,1995). A nonbonded cutoff\ndistance of 10 Å\n2 was used. In Stage 5, each system was heated from 10 K\nto 300 K in 1 ns and with RS (k ¼ 10 kcal=mol Å\n2\n). The temperature\nwas subsequently maintained at 300K using a Langevin thermostat with\na damping constant of γ =5 . 0p s−1 and in Stage 6, the systems\nequilibrated for 1 ns at constantvolume, thus in the NVT ensemble.\nSubsequently the pressure was maintained at 1 atm using a Berendsen\nbarostat with a pressure relaxation time ofτp = 1.0 ps and the systems\nsimulated in the NPT ensemble for 100 ps for each of the subsequent\nstages with RS: Stage 7:k =10 kcal/mol Å\n2,S t a g e8 :k =5k c a l / m o l Å2,\nStage 9:k =1k c a l / m o lÅ2,S t a g e1 0 :k =0 . 5k c a l / m o lÅ2. Finally, in Stage\n11, RS restraints were removed and the systems simulated in the NPT\nensemble for a further 5 ns. Following this, an ensemble of production\nsimulations of 50 × 4 ns replicas was performed for each system in the\nNPT ensemble with the same conditions as Stage 11. Coordinate\nsnapshots from production simulations were generated every 10 ps,\nresulting in an ensemble of trajectories consisting of 20,000 snapshots in\naggregate per system.\nStructural stability and ﬂexibility were analysed by computing\nthe root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the backbone atoms of\nthe protein with respect to the in itial predicted structure (after\naligning the protein backbone) as well as the root-mean-square\nﬂuctuation (RMSF) with respect to the average structure in each\nproduction replica. In the case of complexes, this was carried out\nboth on the overall complex and for individual monomers\nseparately. The number of sidechain-sidechain intramonomer\ncontacts were computed for each snapshot of the production\nMD, based on a heavy atom distance threshold of 4 Å. Similarly,\ninterfacial contacts were computed for each interface in simulated\nprotein complexes based on the same criteria.\nBinding afﬁnities of dimeric complexes were computed using\nthe PRODIGY tool (Xue et al,2016), an established structure-based\nafﬁnity predictor that includes free energy contributions from\ninterface contacts as well as the non-interacting surface. The\ndissociation constant (K\nD) was computed for all 20,000 snapshots\nof the production MD ensemble and then averaged. A default\nthreshold of 5.5 Å was used for the interface contact threshold\nb e t w e e nh e a v y - a t o m so fa m i n oa c i d s .\nMolecular dynamics input and output ﬁles are deposited on\nZenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15208893 ). Input ﬁles are\nstored in “MD_inputs”. Computed properties extracted from\nanalysis of molecular dynamics simulations can be found in\n”MD_outputs”.\nData availability\nThe datasets and computer code produced in this study are available in\nthe following databases: NMR data for RcaT-Sen2 inhibitor designs:\nBMRB (100aa_3_1: 34973; cpx-50-nr2-run_5_0: 52768) ( https://\nbmrb.io/data_library/summary/index.php?bmrbId=34973, https://\nbmrb.io/data_library/summary/index.php?bmrbId=52768).

However, efficiency in human cells has been limited by unknown \nfactors. We identified non-coding RNA (ncRNA) inst abilit y and impaired Cas9 activity due to 5 ′ sgRNA extension as key contributors to low \nretron editor efficiency in human cells. We re-engineered the Eco1 ncRNA to incorporate an e x oribonuclease-resistant RNA pseudoknot from \nthe Zika virus 3 ′ UTR and devised an RNA processing strategy using Csy4 ribonuclease to minimize 5 ′ sgRNA extension. This strategy increased \nsteady -state ncRNA le v els and rescued sgRNA activity, leading to increased templated repair. This work reveals a previously unappreciated role \nfor ncRNA st abilit y in retron editor efficiency in human cells and presents an enhanced Eco1 retron editor capable of precise genome editing in \nhuman cells from a single integrated lentivirus and, in the context of the nCas9 H840A nickase, without creating double-strand breaks. \nGr aphical abstr act \nIntroduction \nGermline and somatic genetic variants play an important role \nin human health and disease [ 1–4 ].

This significantly simpli- \nfies the scalable parallelization of forward genetic screens, re- \ntrieval of rare clones from a population of cells, and somatic \nediting in genetically engineered models of cancer. \nBase editors can install single nucleotide variants with high \nefficiency but require distinct and exquisitely engineered edit- \ning enzymes to generate different types of mutations, limiting \ntheir generalizability as genome editing tools [ 6 ]. In contrast, \nprime editors offer a greater potential to efficiently introduce a \nwide spectrum of mutation types, including small insertions; \nhowever, each prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) requires \nextensive design effort to yield efficient editing, complicating \nthe construction of large pegRNA libraries [ 7–10 ]. There re- \nmains a need for additional methods to complement current \ngenome editing tools that have the properties of broad editing \npotential, predictable activity, and compatibility with lentivi- \nral delivery. \nRetrons are prokaryotic retroelements that play a role \nin anti-phage defense systems [ 11–19 ]. Retrons have been \nadapted as genome editing tools by harnessing their abil- \nity to generate homology-directed repair templates in situ \n[ 20–26 ]. A retron minimally consists of a non-coding RNA \n(ncRNA) that is reverse transcribed into multicopy single- \nstranded DNA (msDNA) by its cognate primer-independent \nreverse transcriptase (RT) [ 27 , 28 ]. The retron ncRNA con- \ntains both the msr stem loops that are required for recogni- \ntion and initiation of reverse transcription and the msd seg- \nment that contains the reverse transcription template [ 27 ]. \nArbitrary sequences of interest can be inserted into the msd \nstem–loop, where they are reversed transcribed into RT-DNA \n[ 27 ]. Fusion of retron protein and RNA components to their \nrespective CRISPR–Cas9 counterparts results in targeted, tem- \nplated DNA repair [ 22 ]. However, the application of retrons \nas genome editing tools in human cells has been limited due to \nlow efficiency of templated repair and editing outcomes domi- \nnated by indels introduced through non-homologous end join- \ning (NHEJ) [ 23–25 ]. \nPrevious efforts to improve retron editor efficiency have fo- \ncused on the cellular abundance of RT-DNA [ 25 , 29 ]. Here, \nwe determined that retron ncRNA and single guide RNA \n(sgRNA) fusion transcripts are unstable in human cells. These \nunstable ncRNAs exhibit limited templated editing efficiency \nand Cas9 endonuclease activity, ultimately resulting in dimin- \nished editing. Through iterative optimization and rational de- \nsign, we developed a ncRNA architecture derived from the \nEco1 (Ec86) retron with enhanced genome editing efficiency \nwithout causing double-strand breaks, reducing unproduc- \ntive editing outcomes and broadening the utility of retrons as \ngenome editing tools in human cells. \nMaterials and methods \nCell culture \nParental HEK293T cell lines and their derivatives were \ncultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s \nmedium (DMEM) with l -glutamine and sodium pyru- \nvate (Gibco) and supplemented with 10% Foundation™\nfetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products). K562 cell \nlines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with \nl -glutamine (Gibco) and 10% Foundation™ FBS (Gemini \nBio-Products). Both HEK293T and K562 parental lines were \nobtained from ATCC. All cell lines were grown at 37 ◦C and \n5% CO 2 . Huh-7.5 cells were maintained in DMEM (Fisher \nScientific, catalog no. 11995065) supplemented with 0.1 \nmM nonessential amino acids (Fisher Scientific, catalog \nno. 11140076) and 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, \nlot #AUJ35777). \nPlasmid cloning \nAll oligos and gBlocks used in this study are listed in \nSupplementary Table S1 . Plasmids were transformed and \npropagated in NEB Stable Competent E. coli (New England \nBiolabs). All ncRNA-expressing plasmids were cloned from \nlentiGuide-Puro (lentiGuide-Puro was a gift from Feng Zhang, \nAddgene #52963) using the PacI restriction enzyme cloning \nsites followed by NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (New Eng- \nland Biolabs) of synthesized gBlock™ gene fragments (Inte- \ngrated DNA T echnologies). Cas9-RT wt expression plasmid \nwas cloned from pBZ210 (pBZ210 was a gift from Hunter \nFraser, Addgene #170185) by XbaI and PciI double diges- \ntion (New England Biolabs) to excise the chimeric sgRNA- \nretron ncRNA, followed by blunting with DNA Polymerase I \nLarge Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs). The result- \ning double-stranded DNA blunt ends were then ligated using a \nT4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Cas9-RTmut was generated \nby site-directed mutagenesis. TR-Csy4 and TR-Csy4-H29A \nwere gifts from Aravind Asokan (Addgene #80601, Addgene \n#80602). \nIn vitro transcription \nT7 expression plasmids were linearized by digestion with \nEcoRI (New England Biolabs) and then purified by phenol–\nchloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. A \n5- μl in vitro transcription reaction was set up with 250 ng of \nlinearized plasmid template, 0.375 μl of T7 RNA Polymerase \n(New England Biolabs), and 100 mM each of ATP , GTP , CTP , \nand UTP, and then incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. In vitro tran- \nscribed (IVT) RNA was then purified by phenol–chloroform \nextraction and ethanol precipitation. \nPlasmid transfection and electroporation \nLipofectamine 3000 was used for all transient transfections \nof HEK293T-BFP cells. Briefly, 2e5 HEK293T-BFP cells were \nreverse transfected with 750 ng of either Cas9-RTwt or Cas9- \nRTmut and 650 ng of plasmids expressing the retron edi- \ntor ncRNA. For all experiments incorporating Csy4 cleavage, \n750 ng of either Csy4 wild type or Csy4-H29A was added to \nthe transfection mix, and constructs without a Csy4 recogni- \ntion site were co-transfected with 750 ng pUC19 (New Eng- \nland Biolabs) to balance total transfected mass. Cells were \nreplated in a 12-well plate ∼16–24 h after transfection. The \nNeon NxT Electroporation System was used to electroporate \nK562-BFP ncRNA-expressing cell lines with Cas9-RT plas- \nmids and one of Csy4, Csy4-H29A, or pUC19 to balance to- \ntal transfected mass. 5e5 cells were pelleted at 300 RCF for 5 \nmin and resuspended in Neon NxT R buffer and then mixed \nwith 2500 ng of the Cas9-RT plasmid and 2500 ng of TR- \nCsy4 / TR-Csy4-H29A / pUC19 plasmid. Cells were then elec- \ntroporated using the following parameters in a 10- μl Neon \nNxT tip: 1050 V, 20 ms pulse width, 2 pulses. Cells were added \nto 500 μl of pre-warmed RPMI media in a 48-well plate after \npulsing. \nEnhanced Eco1 retron editor 3 \nFlow cytometry \nAll flow cytometry experiments were done on a BD FAC- \nSymphony™ A5 Cell Analyzer. To prepare samples, cells \nwere centrifuged at 350 RCF for 5 min and the cell pellets \nwere resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline \n(Gibco) supplemented with 1% Foundation™ FBS (Gemini \nBio-Products). Cell populations were analyzed to determine \nthe proportion of BFP (blue fluorescent protein) and GFP \n(green fluorescent protein) positive cells and each condition \nwas run with three biological replicates. Transfected cells were \nselected using the mCherry fluorescent reporter on the Cas9- \nRT expression plasmids. All gates were drawn using untrans- \nfected control samples. \nVirus production \nT25 flasks were seeded with 2e6 HEK293T cells 24 h prior \nto transfection. On the following day, a transfection solution \nwas made up of 200 μl OptiMEM (Gibco), 3 μg of the lentivi- \nral vector, 2 μg of psPAX2, 1 μg of pMD2.G, and 12 μg \nof PEI 25K (Polysciences). psPAX2 and pMD2.G were gifts \nfrom Didier Trono (Addgene #12260, Addgene #12259). Af- \nter mixing, the transfection solution was vortexed for 15 s, \nincubated at room temperature for 15 min, and added to cells \ndrop wise. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection. \nAt 72 h post-transfection, the viral supernatant was filtered \nthrough a 0.45- μm syringe filter and immediately stored at \n−80 ◦C. \nLentivirus transduction \nThe HEK293T-BFP cell line was made by limiting dilution \nlentivirus transduction of BFP dest clone lentivirus and se- \nlected with 6 μg / ml blasticidin (Gibco) for 1 week. BFP dest \nclone was a gift from Jacob Corn (Addgene #71825). Cells \nwere then single-cell sorted into a 96-well plate for the top \n2.5% fluorescent cells. Single-cell clones were expanded and \ntwo clonal lines were randomly selected. Low-copy integrated \nncRNA HEK293T-BFP cell lines were generated by limiting \ndilution lentivirus transduction. 5e5 cells were plated in a \nsix-well plate and limiting volumes of viral supernatant were \nadded to each well, ranging from 50 to 1 μl. Twenty-four \nhours after the addition of virus, the cells were selected us- \ning 2 μg / ml puromycin (Gibco) and grown out on puromycin \nfor 1 week. For every HEK293T-BFP cell line generated, 1 μl \nof virus was sufficient to yield sparse colonies for subsequent \noutgrowth. \nThe K562-BFP cell line used in this study was a gift from \nDr Chris Richardson. Low-copy integrated ncRNA K562- \nBFP cell lines were generated by limiting dilution spinfection. \nBriefly, 1e6 K562-BFP cells were plated in a six-well plate with \n2 ml of RPMI 1640 media. After plating, 20 μl of lentivirus \nand 2 μl of polybrene (Sigma–Aldrich) were added directly to \neach well and cells were centrifuged at 930 RCF for 2 h at \nroom temperature. After centrifugation, 2 ml of RPMI 1640 \nmedia was added to each well and cells were placed back in \nthe incubator. Selection for infected cells started 24 h after \nspinfection using 2 μg / ml puromycin. \nNor thern blot ting \n1e6 HEK293T cells were first reverse transfected in a six- \nwell plate with 1 μg of Cas9-RT (either Cas9-RTwt or Cas9- \nRTmut) and 1 μg of ncRNA-expressing plasmid using Lipo- \nfectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. \nCells were incubated for 48 h and then total RNA was ex- \ntracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by two \nchloroform washes. The aqueous layer was loaded onto a \nMonarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (New England Biolabs) \ncolumn and purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol. \nTo radiolabel single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes, 0.15 mCi \nATP (- 32 P) (Perkin Elmer) was mixed with 200 ng of the probe \nand T4 Kinase (New England Biolabs) and then incubated at \n37 ◦C for 60 min. Labeled probes were then centrifuged for \n30 s at 16 000 RCF in a MicroSpin G-50 column (Cytiva) \nand eluted in 80 μl of TNES buffer [50 mM Tris, 400 mM \nNaCl, 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5% \nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)]. Probe sequences are listed in \nSupplementary Table S1 . For electrophoretic size separation, \n25 ng of IVT RNA and 7.5 μg of total RNA were loaded per \nwell onto a Novex 10% TBE–urea 10-well gel (Invitrogen). \nRNA was then transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge (Cytiva) \nnylon membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo (Bio-Rad) \nat 200 mA for 60 min. Membranes were blocked at 65 ◦C for 1 \nh in 30 ml of 6 × SSC 7% SDS blocking buffer. After blocking, \nmembranes were incubated overnight at 42 ◦C with 30 μl of \nthe radiolabeled probe. Membranes were washed and exposed \nfor 48 h before imaging. For U6 loading controls, membranes \nwere stripped using 0.1% SDS 2 mM EDTA stripping buffer, \nfollowed by three washes and then reprobed using a U6 load- \ning control probe. Loading control membranes were exposed \nfor 24 h before imaging. \nQuantitative real-time PCR \nFirst, 5e5 HEK293T-BFP ncRNA-expressing cells were re- \nverse transfected with 1 μg of Cas9-RTmut plasmid. \nTwenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with \n5 μg / ml of dactinomycin (Sigma–Aldrich) and then lysed with \nTRIzol at the specified time points. The TRIzol lysates were \nwashed with chloroform and the aqueous phases were loaded \nonto RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen), and washed and \neluted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To remove \nresidual DNA, the purified RNA samples were treated with \nDNase I (New England Biolabs), followed by heat inactiva- \ntion of DNase I at 70 ◦C. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was \nmade from the purified RNA using the GoScript Reverse Tran- \nscription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s \nprotocol with 5 μl of input RNA for each reaction. Quan- \ntitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed with PowerUp \nSYBR Green Master Mix and recorded on QuantStudio3. The \nprimers used for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . \nStatistics and reproducibility \nAll experiments were performed in triplicate. Outcomes here \nare presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For all edit- \ning outcome assays, statistical significance was determined by \ntwo-sided, unpaired t -tests using the Holm–Šídák method for \nmultiple testing correction.

A protein-coding plasmid expresses Cas9 fused to a \ncodon optimized Eco1 reverse transcriptase by a 33-amino \nacid linker and is followed by a T2A ribosome skipping se- \nquence and mCherry (Cas9-RT mCherry). This construct al- \nlows tracking of transfected cells by red–orange fluorescence \n(Fig. 1 A). To control for background levels of plasmid tem- \nplated repair, we constructed a catalytically dead Eco1 mutant \n(DD196NN, RTmut) [ 30 ] and confirmed that the mutant is \ninactive by qPCR of retron RT-DNA after RNA transfection \n( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). ncRNA plasmids were designed to \nexpress the Eco1 ncRNA with a 100-nucleotide repair tem- \nplate internal to the msd sequences as previously described \n(msr-msd) [ 22 , 31 ]. Retron ncRNAs or sgRNAs encoded by \nseparate plasmids were expressed from the U6 RNAPIII pro- \nmoter and terminated by a poly(T) transcription termination \nsignal [ 32 ]. \nTo compare retron editor designs, we measured genome \nediting rates using an established assay based on the conver- \nsion of an integrated cDNA encoding BFP to GFP by missense \nmutation of the chromophore [ 31 , 33 ]. Cas9-RT mCherry \nand a plasmid encoding an sgRNA targeting the BFP chro- \nmophore (sgBFP) were co-transfected with a repair template \nencoding the mutation conferring GFP expression and a dis- \nruption of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of sgBFP \n(Fig. 1 B). One of three repair template configurations was \nused: msr-msd plasmid, ( in vitro transcribed) IVT msr-msd \nRNA ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), or a synthetic 100-nucleotide \nssDNA. Editing outcomes were tracked by the relative propor- \ntion of BFP+ (no edit), BFP − (NHEJ), or GFP+ (HDR) cells \n(Fig. 1 C). \nTo investigate the contribution of repair template availabil- \nity, msr-msd RNA and ssDNA were transfected at either 6 \npmol, representing a typical quantity of transfected ssDNA \nrepair template [ 34 ] or 0.6 pmol, a quantity that we predicted \nwould be limiting. After 72 h, we quantified editing outcomes \n(Fig. 1 D). While the msr-msd plasmid edited the BFP locus \nto 0.95% ± 0.01%, consistent with prior literature [ 23–25 ], \ntransfected IVT msr-msd RNA did not generate any success- \nful editing events. In contrast, the ssDNA conditions resulted \nin efficient and dose-dependent templated repair of 5.47% \n± 0.23% and 10.73% ± 0.15% in the 0.6 and 6 pmol con- \nditions, respectively. These results highlight a positive corre- \nlation between ssDNA quantity and editing efficiency and are \nconsistent with the hypothesis that the Eco1 retron produces \ninsufficient suitable homology template in comparison to \nssDNA. \nSteady-state levels of retron ncRNAs are limited in \nhuman cells \nTo measure steady-state levels of transfected retron ncR- \nNAs by northern blot, we designed 32 P-radiolabeled ssDNA \nprobes complementary to the sgBFP scaffold sequence present \nin both the 106-nucleotide sgBFP transcript and the 334- \nnucleotide full-length fusion transcripts of sgBFP and msr-msd \n(Fig. 2 A). Pilot northern blot experiments revealed that co- \ndelivery of Cas9 with sgBFP was required to stabilize sgR- \nNAs ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Based on this result, Cas9- \nRT mCherry plasmid was co-transfected in all subsequent \nexperiments. We transfected plasmids encoding sgBFP, msr- \nmsd-sgBFP, or sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNAs and extracted to- \ntal RNA for northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). The abun- \ndance of sgBFP, fused in either orientation, to msr-msd \nncRNA was lower than sgBFP alone. We also observed that \nEnhanced Eco1 retron editor 5 \nU6\nfull-length\nncRNA\nU6\nsgBFP\nintermediate\nlength RNA\nsgBFP msr-msd-sgBFP sgBFP-msr-msd\nIVT\n RNA\nRTwt IVT RNARTmutRTwt RTm\nut\nRTw\nt\n100\n200\n300\nsgBFP-msr-msd\nIVT RNAplasmidlent\ni\nplasmid lenti\nIVT \nRNA\nRTm\nut\nRT\nwt\nRTm\nut\nRTwt\nsgBFP\nfull-length\nncRNA\nsgBFP\nintermediate\nlength RNA \n100\n200\n300\nA BC\nsgBFP (106 nt)\nsgBFP-msr-msd (304 nt)\nmsr-msd-sgBFP (304 nt)\n32P probe\n5’\n5’\nFigure 2.

( C ) Northern blot showing RNA levels of sgBFP or sgBFP-msr-msd when expressed from \neither transient transfection of a plasmid or lo w-cop y integration of a lentivirus vector. \nwhile the U6 snRNA loading control showed no evidence of \nRNA degradation, there was a consistent pattern of inter- \nmediate length ncRNA products that were not observed in \nIVT RNA samples. We hypothesized that these intermediate- \nlength products originated through degradation by endoge- \nnous nucleases rather than early transcription termination, \nas they were present even when probing the 3 ′ end of the \nncRNA. \nncRNA expression in a low-copy lentivirus integration cell \nline with an sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNA construct was compared \nto RNA expression from a cell line with low-copy integra- \ntions of sgBFP alone (Fig. 2 C). We detected a band corre- \nsponding to full-length sgBFP when expressed from a trans- \nfected plasmid and from an integrated locus; however, we \nwere unable to detect the full-length sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNA \nwhen integrated despite being expressed from the same pro- \nmoter and plasmid backbone as sgBFP. Taken together, these \nresults were indicative of ncRNA degradation by endogenous \nnucleases. \nEfficient retron editing favors ncRNA architectures \nencoding sgRNAs with native 5 ′ ends \nTo determine which elements of ncRNA architecture most \nstrongly affected editing efficiency, we systematically tested \ndifferent ncRNA designs by transient transfection of retron \neditor plasmids. Initially we compared editing efficiencies of \ncis or trans expression of the sgRNA and retron template. \nIn this case, cis refers to a fusion transcript of sgRNA and \nretron msr-msd components, while trans refers to expression \nof sgRNA and retron msr-msd as two separate transcripts. \nFor editing in the context of a fusion RNA, we were inter- \nested in how orientation of the sgRNA relative to msr-msd \nmight impact retron editing efficiency (i.e. msr -msd-sgBFP ver - \nsus sgBFP-msr-msd). \nWe observed that with Cas9-RTwt the msr-msd-sgBFP ori- \nentation showed no significant increase in GFP+ cells as \ncompared to Cas9-RTmut (0.36% ± 0.07% versus 0.37% \n± 0.04%), indicating that the GFP+ cells likely result from \nplasmid-templated repair in this context (Fig. 3 A). However, \ntrans expression of the sgRNA and msr-msd from two differ- \nent plasmids (sgBFP + msr-msd) and an sgBFP-msr-msd ori- \nentation had a marginal but statistically significant increase \nin editing efficiency (0.43% ± 0.08% and 0.64% ± 0.06%, \nrespectively). These results demonstrate that the overall archi- \ntecture of the retron ncRNA favors an sgRNA with a native \n5 ′ end. \nThe importance of the relative abundance of the sgRNA \nand retron RNA template is an aspect of retron-mediated \ngenome editing that has not previously been explored. We ex- \nploited our finding that retron ncRNA components are func- \ntional in trans to interrogate the relationship between ncRNA \nand sgRNA abundance and retron editing efficiency under \nconditions where one RNA is limiting. We packaged either \nsgBFP or msr-msd as lentivirus and transduced HEK293T- \nBFP cells at low MOI to bias toward low copy number. Sub- \nsequently, we transfected the cognate component to induce \noverexpression relative to the low copy integrated compo- \nnent (Fig. 3 B). When integrated and expressed with trans- \nfected Cas9-RT mCherry plasmid, sgBFP disrupted BFP at a \nmean frequency of 98.28% ± 0.14%, while conversely, the \nmsr-msd-sgBFP fusion was unable to disrupt BFP at a fre- \nquency > 6.93% ± 0.15% (Fig. 3 C). Efficient BFP disrup- \ntion was restored when sgBFP was expressed with msr-msd \ntemplate in trans by either transfection or integration. Over- \nall, templated editing efficiency from integrated constructs \nwas less than 0.1% except when sgBFP was integrated in the \ngenome and the msr-msd template was overexpressed by plas- \nmid transfection (Fig. 3 D). Under these conditions, templated \nrepair overwhelmingly originates from RT-DNA, evidenced \nby a significant increase in GFP+ cells with Cas9-RTwt as \ncompared to Cas9-RTmut that establishes the baseline level \nof plasmid templated repair. These results suggest that the \nmsr-msd template levels could be limiting in human cells and \nthat retron-mediated editing efficiency might be improved by \nincreasing the abundance of the ncRNA. These results also \nindicate that fusion of the sgRNA to the retron msr-msd in- \nhibits Cas9 nuclease activity, potentially by interfering with \nefficient RNP assembly due to misfolding or steric hindrance \n[ 35 ]. \n6 Cattle et al. \nAB\nDC\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd\n-sgBFP\nsgBFP-msr\n-msd\nsgBFP\n+ msr-msd\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nmsr\n-ms\nd-sgBFP lentimsr-msd le\nnti\n+ sgBFP p\nlasmid\nsgBFP le\nnti\nsgBFP lenti\n+ msr\n-msd\n plasmid\nmsr\n-ms\nd-sgBFP len\nti\nmsr-\nmsd lenti\n+ sg\nBFP \nplasmid\nsgBFP \nlenti\nsgBFP \nlenti\n+ msr\n-msd\n plasmid\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5HDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nD15: FlowD1: Transduction\nsgBFP or\nmsr-msd lentivirus\nD2: Puromycin\nD9: Transfection\nCas9-RT mCherry\n+ sgBFP or msr-msd\nBFP\nBFP\nGFP\nNo edit\nNHEJ\nHDR\nSTOP\nCas9-RT mCherry\nsgBFP plasmid+\n+ Cas9-RT mCherry\nmsr-msd plasmid\nmsr-msd\nlentivirus\nsgBFP\nlentivirus\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nFigure 3.

We hypothesized that \nprotecting free msr-msd ends would stabilize and increase \nmsr-msd abundance and improve editing efficiency. Since the \nsgRNA is already protected by co-expression with Cas9, we \nfocused on designs aimed at stabilizing the 5 ′ end of the msr- \nmsd-sgRNA fusion orientation. This orientation also places \nthe repair template proximal to the sgRNA spacer sequence, \nwhich is advantageous for molecular cloning. We tested three \nstrategies of RNA protection found in nature: RNA circular- \nization [ 37 ], 3 ′ polyadenylation [ 38 ], and RNA pseudoknots \n[ 39 ]. To generate a circular RNA (circRNA) construct, we \ntook advantage of flanking transfer RNA (tRNA) ligation se- \nquences as endogenous tRNA ligase activity has previously \nbeen used to extend sgRNA half-life in cells [ 40 ]. Polyadenyla- \ntion of RNAPIII-expressed SINE transcripts has been achieved \nby the addition of a canonical AA T AAA polyA signal to the 3 ′ \nend of the transcript, and we reasoned that we could similarly \ntake advantage of the stability provided by a polyA tail [ 38 ]. \nFinally, we tested three additional approaches incorporating \nstability-enhancing RNA pseudoknots on the 5 ′ end that all \nhave been previously used to stabilize pegRNA transcripts and \nimprove prime editing efficiency [ 9 , 41 ]. \nWe tested five distinct ncRNA plasmids with the inten- \ntion of circularizing, polyadenylating, or pseudoknot protect- \ning the retron editor ncRNA (Fig. 4 A) and tested the degree \nto which each construct stabilized Eco1 retron editor tran- \nscripts within the cellular environment. Total RNA was ex- \ntracted from HEK293T-BFP cells co-transfected with the dif- \nferent msr-msd plasmids and either Cas9-RT or Cas9-RTmut. \nSteady-state RNA levels were probed by northern blot as de- \nscribed above (Fig. 4 B). \nNext, we compared editing efficiencies of these different \nstability-enhancing ncRNAs to msr-msd-sgBFP. When trans- \nfected with Cas9-RTwt, the xrRNA-msr-msd-sgBFP reached \nGFP editing rates as high as 1.83% ± 0.16%, representing \na nearly three-fold improvement over the native unprotected \nncRNA (Fig. 4 C). No other ncRNAs tested improved tem- \nplated editing rates, while the circRNA design exhibited re- \nduced performance due to significantly impaired Cas9 activity, \nresulting in < 0.1% editing efficiency. \nSince the xrRNA pseudoknot evolved in nature to block \nnuclease-mediated degradation of an RNA genome [ 42 , 43 ] \nwe hypothesized that a similar mechanism could explain the \nincrease in RNA abundance in this context. To test whether \nexonuclease resistance is required for the increase in edit- \ning efficiency imparted by the xrRNA, we introduced a sin- \ngle point mutation (C20G) known to disrupt the pseudoknot \nthree-way junction and decrease exonuclease resistance while \nmaintaining overall secondary structure of the xrRNA stem–\nloops [ 44 , 45 ] (Fig. 4 D, inset). To assess differences in half- \nlife, we treated HEK293T cells expressing xrRNA or xrRNA \nC20G transcripts with dactinomycin to inhibit transcription \nand collected samples at multiple time points over 8 hours for \nanalysis. Total RNA was extracted and the abundance of each \ntranscript was quantitated by reverse transcription followed \nby qPCR. The xrRNA C20G transcript rapidly decreased \nin abundance by single-phase exponential decay ( R 2 = 0.99) \nEnhanced Eco1 retron editor 7 \nsgBFP\nIVT RNARTwtIVT RNARTmutRTwtRTmutRT\nwt\nRTmutRTwt\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\ncircRNA\npolyA RNA\npseudoknot(s)\ncircRNA\npoly(A)\nRNA\nsgBFP evopreQ1 mpknot xrRNA\nIVT RNARTwtIVT RNARTmutRTwtRTmutRTwtRTmutRTwt\npseudoknots\nA\nC\nB\nDE\nspacerU6\nmsdmsd templatemsr\nTTTTTT\nscaffold\nspacerU6\nmsdmsd templatemsr\nAATAAA poly(A) signal\nscaffold\npseudoknot\nspacerU6\nmsdmsd templatemsr\nTTTTTT\nTTTTTT\nscaffold\nTwister Twister\nU6 spacer\nmsdmsd templatemsr\nTTTTTT3’ stem5’ stem\nscaffold\nU6\nfull-length\nncRNA\nsgBFP\nintermediate\nlength RNA\nsgBFP\nsgBFP\nsgBFP\nsgBFP\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA\nxrRNA C2\n0G\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nF\n5’ 3’\nxrRNAC\nG\n6\n0\n.5\n1\n2\n4\n8\n1\n10\n100\nTime post dactinomycin (h)\nTranscript remaining (%)\nxrRNA\nxrRNA C20G\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\ncircRNA\npoly\nA RNA\nevopreQ1mpknot xrRNA\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\npseudoknots\nxrRN\nA\nxrRNA C20G\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\nCopies per 100 ng RNA\nFigure 4.

In contrast, the xrRNA transcript decreased in a sub- \nexponential manner, reaching approximately one-third of the \ninitial quantity by 8 h. The increased stability of the xrRNA \ntranscript compared to the xrRNA C20G transcript coin- \ncided with a steady-state abundance ∼27-fold greater (Fig. \n4 E). Functionally, the C20G point mutation abolished any in- \ncrease in editing efficiency, supporting exonuclease resistance \nas the aspect of the xrRNA-msd-msd-sgBFP ncRNA that en- \nhances retron editing efficiency (Fig. 4 F). \nCsy4 cleavage and pseudoknot protection enable \nEco1 retron editing without double-strand breaks \nDespite the improvements in xrRNA-msd-msr-sgBFP abun- \ndance and editing efficiency in the context of transient plasmid \ntransfection, when integrated by lentivirus this design showed \nlow BFP disruption rates of 13.06% ± 0.28% and an absence \nof templated repair as a likely consequence of this modifica- \ntion ( Supplementary Fig. S4 A). Based on prior reports that \nsgRNA activity is reduced by 5 ′ extensions [ 35 ] and given our \nresults demonstrating reduced BFP disruption in the context \nof 5 ′ sgBFP fusions, we reasoned that Cas9 activity might be if \nthe msr-msd RNA was enzymatically cleaved from the sgRNA \nafter transcription, thereby liberating the sgRNA and mini- \nmizing 5 ′ sgRNA extension. \nWe explored multiple strategies to cleave the msr-msd- \nsgBFP including tRNA sequences that have natural process- \ning of their 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends by cellular RNases [ 46 ], as well \nas the Csy4 endoribonuclease that cleaves at a specific 20-nt \nstem–loop sequence [ 47 ]. We tested three processable retron \neditor ncRNAs: two tRNA sequences and one Csy4-cleavable \ntranscript. tRNAPro represents a full-length prolyl tRNA se- \nquence between the template and sgRNA, while dC55G in- \ncorporates an engineered prolyl tRNA with reduced inter- \nnal promoter activity and improved RNA processing [ 48 ]. \nWhen co-transfected with Cas9-RT and a plasmid express- \ning wild-type Csy4, the Csy4-cleavable retron editor ncRNA \n(msr-msd-csy4-sgBFP) showed marginal improvements in RT- \ndependent templated repair as compared to an unprocessed \nncRNA ( Supplementary Fig. S4 B). This improvement is Csy4 \ncleavage dependent, as increased editing was not observed \nwhen co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a nuclease de- \nficient Csy4 mutant (Csy4-H29A). Processing the sgRNA to \nminimize 5 ′ extension serves to further improve editing effi- \nciency of the Eco1 retron editor ncRNA. \nTo overcome the limitations of low steady-state RNA and \nlimited Cas9 nuclease activity due to fusion ncRNA retron \neditor architectures, we combined the strategies of pseudo- \nknot protection and Csy4 cleavage into a single ncRNA con- \nstruct: xrRNA-msr -msd-csy4-sgBFP (Fig. 5 A), wherein an xr - \nRNA pseudoknot is grafted onto the 5 ′ end of the msr-msd \n8 Cattle et al. \nHEK293T-BFP\nK562-BFP\nHEK293T-BFP\nB C\nA\nHEK293T-BFP\nRTCas95’\nxrRNA\nmsr-msd\nevopreQ1\n3’\nxrRNA evopreQ1\nspacer\nmsdmsd templatemsr\npoly(U)Csy4 stem loop\nscaffold\nCsy4 sgBFP\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20HDR (% of mCherry +)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nCsy4Csy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nK562-BFP\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n1.0\n2.0\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgB\nFP\nxrRNA-csy\n4\nxrRN\nA-evopre\nQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-\ncsy4\nxrRNA-evo\npreQ1-csy4\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nsgBF\nP\nmsr-msd\n-sgBF\nP\nxrRNA\n-csy4\nxrRNA-evopre\nQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1\n-csy4\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nHDR (% of mCherry+)\nnCas9-RTmut\nnCas9-RTwt\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0HDR (% of mCherry+)\nnCas9-RTmut\nnCas9-RTwt\nCsy4-H29A\nCsy4\nsgB\nFP\nmsr-msd-sgB\nFP\nxrRNA-\ncsy4\nxrRNA-evo\npreQ1-cs\ny4\nxrRN\nA-csy4\nxrRNA-e\nvopreQ1-c\nsy4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nnCas9-RTwt\nnCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nCas9-RTmut\nCsy4-H29A Csy4\nCsy4-H29A Csy4\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nCas9-RTmut\nCas9-RTwt\nnCas9-RTmut\nnCas9-RTwt\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nCsy4-H29A Csy4\nK562-BFP\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr\n-msd-sgBFPxrR\nNA-csy4\nxrRNA-ev\nopreQ1-csy\n4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrR\nNA-evopreQ1-c\nsy4\nsgBF\nP\nmsr\n-msd\n-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-ev\nopre\nQ1-cs\ny4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nCsy4\nCsy4-H29A\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nCsy4-H29A\nCsy4\nDE\nFG\nsgBFP\nmsr-msd-sgBFP\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\nxrRNA-csy4\nxrRNA-evopreQ1-csy4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100No edit (% of mCherry+)\nFigure 5.

We also tested xrRNA-msr-msd- \nevopreQ-Csy4-sgBFP, which incorporates an additional pseu- \ndoknot on the 3 ′ end of the template that is exposed after \nCsy4 cleavage for additional nuclease protection of the mature \nmsr-msd. \nIn HEK293T-BFP cells transiently transfected with the en- \nhanced Eco1 retron editor, we observed a 2.26-fold increase \nin templated editing (Fig. 5 B), while in the K562-BFP chronic \nmyelogenous leukemia cell line transfected with the improved \nEco1 retron editor, we observed a 10.63-fold increase in \ntemplated editing (Fig. 5 C). Contrary to our initial expecta- \ntions and our findings in K562-BFP cells, we observed con- \nsistently greater templated editing in HEK293T-BFP cells co- \ntransfected with Csy4-H29A versus wild-type Csy4. This re- \nsult led us to consider whether reduced sgRNA efficiency \ncould be beneficial in certain contexts by limiting the occur- \nrence of dead-end NHEJ outcomes prior to RT-DNA forma- \ntion. When tested in low-copy HEK293T-BFP cell lines, the en- \nhanced Eco1 xrRNA-msr-msd-evopreQ-csy4-sgBFP construct \nled to a 27-fold increase in templated editing when com- \npared to the native Eco1 retron editor ncRNA (Fig. 5 D). In \na similar experiment conducted in K562-BFP cells, we ob- \nserved BFP disruption frequencies of templated editing rates \nof 1.33% ± 0.03% versus < 0.01% using the unoptimized \nncRNA construct (Fig. 5 E). \nFinally, we hypothesized that this improved editing effi- \nciency could enable editing without introducing double-strand \nbreaks. We mutated the Cas9-RT mCherry vectors to encode \nthe H840A nickase mutant (nCas9) and discovered that in \nHEK293T-BFP cells (Fig. 5 F) and in K562-BFP cells (Fig. 5 G) \nit was possible to achieve precise genome editing without ev- \nident BFP disruption. Amplicon sequencing confirmed indel \nfrequency of ∼5% ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Editing in the \ncontext of nCas9-RT was entirely dependent on a functional \nRT, 5 ′ xrRNA, and Csy4 processing. \nDiscussion \nRetron-mediated genome editing is an emerging biotechnol- \nogy that complements existing tools for precision rewriting of \ngenomic DNA. Retrons generate short ssDNA in situ for tem- \nplated repair, leading to predictable editing outcomes and en- \nabling applications that require large and complex DNA edits \nin diverse sequence contexts. Previously, retron editors have \nbeen used to introduce missense mutations in human cells but \ntheir utility is limited by poor efficiency when compared to \northologous systems expressed in bacteria and yeast [ 20 , 22 ]. \nIn this study, we identified unstable Eco1 ncRNA as a factor \ninfluencing low efficiency of templated genome editing in hu- \nman cells. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a series \nof retron ncRNA variants to incorporate stability-enhancing \nsecondary structures including a nuclease-resistant RNA pseu- \ndoknot from the Zika virus 3 ′ UTR that robustly rescued \nsteady-state RNA levels in the context of transfected and sta- \nbly integrated constructs. We further identified impaired Cas9 \nendonuclease activity in the context of a chimeric msr-msd- \nsgRNA fusion transcript and evaluated strategies to restore \nthe native ends of both RNAs. Enhanced editing required the \nCsy4 endoribonuclease to enzymatically process the sgRNA \nfrom the retron ncRNA components, which rescued Cas9 ac- \ntivity when the RNA components were expressed as a single \ntranscript. Combining these approaches enabled efficient pre- \ncision genome editing by transient transfection, editing from a \nlentiviral vector integrated at low copy, and editing without in- \ntroducing double-strand breaks when co-transfected with the \nCas9 H840A nickase (nCas9-RT) mutant [ 49 ]. \nThe utility of genome editing technologies based on \nCRISPR–Cas systems has been expanded by fusing various en- \nzymes to Cas9 to recruit enzymatic activities to target DNA. \nIn the case of prime editing, this also requires extending the \nsgRNA from the 3 ′ end to encode information for reverse \ntranscriptase priming and the recombination template, which \nis referred to as a pegRNA [ 7 ]. The 3 ′ components of a pe- \ngRNA are exposed to degradation by endogenous nucleases \n[ 41 ]. Previous studies have identified approaches to protect the \n3 ′ ends of pegRNAs including extension by RNA secondary \nstructures and overexpression of the small RNA-binding ex- \nonuclease protection factor La [ 50 ]. In the present study, stabi- \nlization of the sgRNA was not required as it is protected when \nco-expressed with Cas9-RT; instead, we employed a strategy \nto protect both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of the Eco1 ncRNA, which, \nin this context, significantly outperformed the native ncRNA. \nRecent studies have shown that 3 ′ truncated pegRNAs are \npreferentially loaded into Cas9 and that pegRNAs with strong \n5 ′ and 3 ′ complementarity could circularize into a structure \nsimilar to retron ncRNA:sgRNA fusions [ 51 ,52 ]. These find- \nings are consistent with our data that ncRNA:sgRNA fusions \nand circRNAs are relatively inefficient as Cas9 guide RNAs. \nFurther improvements in efficiency may also be realized \nthrough rational design, directed evolution, or metagenomic \nstudies aimed at increasing the efficiency and processivity of \nreverse transcription in human cells or by increasing the suit- \nability of the msDNA structure as a substrate for templated \nrepair. Since the msDNA arises from the ncRNA, we expect \nRT improvements to complement ncRNA stabilization. We \nbelieve that it will be possible to enhance the genome editing \nutility of retron editors by using PAM-expanded Cas variants, \nharnessing the intrinsic RNase activity of Cas12a to stream- \nline RNA processing [ 53 ], and / or implementing alternative \npromoter strategies to overcome the processivity limitations \nof the U6 promoter [ 32 ]. \nThis study investigated the limitations of Eco1 retron- \nmediated genome editing in human cells. Through system- \natic modifications and comparative assessments, we have \nidentified key factors influencing the efficiency of a model \nretron editor. Incorporating RNA-stabilizing pseudoknots and \nCsy4 cleavage yielded an enhanced Eco1 retron editor ca- \npable of writing sequences to the genome without double- \nstrand breaks. Genome editing tools that rely on double- \nstrand breaks to introduce templated missense mutations are \nlimited by a general preference for NHEJ as a repair mecha- \nnism, which biases editing outcomes away from the intended \nedit [ 54 , 55 ]. This advance in retron editing resolves one of \nthe most significant limitations of the technology by reducing \nthe frequency of unproductive editing outcomes. \nA c kno wledg ements \nWe thank our colleagues Drs Jef Boeke, Benjamin tenOever, \nand Timothee Lionnet as well as the members of the Rice and \nPoirier labs for their helpful discussions.

{"text": "ARTICLE OPEN\nStructural basis of the RNA-mediated Retron-Eco2\noligomerization\nYanjing Wang1,4, Chen Wang 2,4, Yongqi Yin1, Yongqing Cui1, Zhikang Dai1, Chang Liu1, Yanke Chen 3, Zeyuan Guan 3 ✉ and\nTingting Zou 1 ✉\n© The Author(s) 2025\nIn the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and viruses, retrons have emerged as distinctive antiphage defense systems. Here,\nwe elucidate the structure and function of Retron-Eco2, which comprises a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that encodes multicopy single-\nstranded DNA (msDNA, a DNA‒RNA hybrid) and a fusion protein containing a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain and a\ntopoisomerase-primase-like (Toprim) effector domain. The Eco2 msDNA and RT-Toprim fusion protein form a 1:1 stoichiometric\nnucleoprotein complex that further assembles into a trimer (msDNA:RT-Toprim ratio of 3:3) with a distinctive triangular\nconﬁguration. The RNA portion of the msDNA in one protomer closely intertwines around the RT domain of an adjacent protomer,\nmediating the formation of this self-inhibitory assembly. Upon activation, the Toprim effector domain exhibits RNase activity,\ndegrading RNA to arrest phage replication. We further reveal that phage mutants evading Eco2-mediated defense harbor\nmutations in the endonuclease IV-like protein DenB, underscoring DenB’s critical role in triggering the activation of this system.\nTogether, these ﬁndings provide key structural and functional insights into Retron-Eco2, laying the groundwork for harnessing its\npotential in biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.\nCell Discovery; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-025-00823-y\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the ongoing co-evolutionary arms race between prokaryotes\nand their viral parasites, bacteria have evolved a multitude of\nsophisticated antiviral immune systems with diverse defense\nmechanisms\n1–8. Among these immune systems, retrons, a class\nof widespread genetic elements found in ~11% of the bacterial\ngenomes, along with their associated effector proteins, have\nrecently emerged as key players participating in antiphage\ndefense\n3,9–13. A typical retron comprises a reverse transcriptase\n(RT) and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA)14. The retron RT reverse-\ntranscribes the msd segment of the ncRNA (msdRNA) into DNA\n(msdDNA), which, together with the msr segment (msrRNA),\nforms a single-stranded branched DNA ‒RNA hybrid named\nmulticopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA)\n9,15–19.B e y o n dt h e i r\nbiological roles, retrons have attracted interest as versatile tools\nfor genome engineering due to their ability to synthesize\nmsDNA\n20–33.\nRetrons can be classiﬁed into multiple types based on their\nassociated effector proteins9,10, yet the molecular details of their\nantiphage mechanisms remain largely obscure. While a few\nsystems have been characterized, such as Retron-Eco1 (also\nknown as Ec86) that formsﬁlamentous complexes and mediates\nantiphage defense via NAD+ hydrolysis12,34,35, and Retron-Eco6\n(Ec48) that compromises membrane integrity 9, the underlying\ndefense mechanisms of most retron systems remain poorly\nunderstood. This knowledge gap is especially pronounced for\nretrons where the RT and effector reside within a single fusion\nprotein to function.\nSeveral antiphage/antiplasmid defense system-related proteins\ncontain integral topoisomerase/primase (Toprim) domains, includ-\ning those found in the overcoming lysogenization defect (OLD)\nfamily proteins\n36, Detocs37, Gabija1,38–41, Wadjet42–45, PARIS46–48,\nand retron systems3,9,10. Among Type I retrons, Eco2 (also known\nas Ec67) stands out for its RT-Toprim fusion protein3,9,49. Previous\nstudies have indicated that Eco2 assembles into large supramo-\nlecular complexes50. Investigating the structural basis of Eco2-\nmediated defense and unraveling its mode of action will provide\ncritical insights into the broader functional roles of Toprim\ndomains in bacterial immunity.\nHere, we purify and characterize the Retron-Eco2 system from\nEscherichia coli Cl-1 and determine its cryo-electron microscopy\n(cryo-EM) structure at 2.6 Å resolution. Weﬁnd that Eco2 forms a\ntriangular trimer comprising three msDNA-RT-Toprim units. The\nRNA part of msDNA interconnects RT domains across adjacent\nprotomers, creating a self-inhibitory complex. Toprim domains,\narranged as three legs extending from the msDNA-RT core, exhibit\nRNase activity upon activation, degrading RNA to arrest phage\nreplication. Genetic analyses conﬁrm the importance of Toprim\nenzymatic activity and implicate the phage-encoded DenB\nendonuclease IV-like protein in activating Eco2-mediated defense.\nAlthough Eco2 activation leads to translational inhibition, the\nunderlying mechanism remains to be explored.\nReceived: 26 February 2025 Accepted: 21 July 2025\n1National Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.2Department of Pathology, UMass\nChan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.3National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei,\nChina. 4These authors contributed equally: Yanjing Wang, Chen Wang.✉email: guanzeyuan@mail.hzau.edu.cn; zoutingting@mail.hzau.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/celldiscCell Discovery\n1234567890();,:\nRESULTS\nStructural determination of the Retron-Eco2 defense system\nWe ﬁrst analyzed 3395 retron/retron-like RTs sequences and\nconstructed a comprehensive phylogenetic tree (Supplementary\nFig. S1). Notably, ~32.8% of these RT proteins are fused with\neffector domains, such as Toprim, protease, and Toll/interleukin-1\nreceptor (TIR) domains. Among these, the Toprim domain is the\nmost prevalent, accounting for 37% of the effector associations, as\nseen in Retron-Eco2. Based on this observation, we focused our\nstructural and biochemical studies on Eco2 to elucidate its\nfunction.\nTo elucidate how the Retron-Eco2 system defends against phage\ninfection, weﬁrst cloned and puriﬁed the RT-Toprim fusion protein\nfrom E. coliS10 (Fig.1a). In contrast to the challenging puriﬁcation\nof the Eco1 RT protein, we found that the Eco2 RT-Toprim fusion\nprotein could be readily puriﬁed, which was eluted at the volume\ncorresponding to the monomeric form during size exclusion\nchromatography (SEC) (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Subsequently, we\nco-expressed and puriﬁed RT-Toprim together with its ncRNA, and\nobserved that the Retron-Eco2 complex assembled into an\noligomeric complex (Supplementary Fig. S2a), consistent with\nprevious reports\n50. The presence of msDNA in the Eco2 complex\nwas conﬁrmed by UV absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm and\nurea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) analysis.\nTo further investigate the assembly of the Retron-Eco2 complex,\nwe determined its cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.6 Å\n(Supplementary Fig. S2b‒f and Table S1). Overall, Retron-Eco2\nforms a trimeric, cyclic assembly composed of three msDNA\nmolecules and three RT-Toprim proteins (three msDNA-RT-Toprim\nunits). In the Retron-Eco2 trimer, the msDNA-RT portions from\neach protomer together adopt a triangular architecture, with the\nToprim domains protruding as three perpendicular“legs” extend-\ning from this triangular base (Fig. 1b). The three RT-Toprim\nproteins are held together by the msDNA molecules. The msrRNA\npart of each msDNA molecule spans from one RT-Toprim to the\nnext in a head-to-tail fashion, occupying the active sites of the RT\ndomain (Fig. 1c, d). Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate the\nstructural basis of the Eco2 complex.\nEco2 msDNA adopts a three-bladed propeller-like structure\nAlthough different retrons produce msDNAs with varying primary\nsequences, they share structural and functional features\n10. Similar\nto other reported msDNAs, the IRa1/a2 regions at the 5′- and 3′-\nends of the Eco2 ncRNA are complementary and can hybridize.\nThe Eco2 msr region, which is not reverse transcribed, forms a\nsingle short RNA stem-loop (RSL), while the msd region, composed\nof 67 bases, folds into a single long DNA hairpin (DNA stem-loop,\nDSL) (Fig. 2).\nWithin the Eco2 complex, the msrRNA segments of the three\nmsDNA molecules form a three-bladed propeller-like structure\n(Fig. 2b).

The 5’-end tail includes IRa2, rG15, and the\nsingle-stranded RNA a (ssRa) segment (rA16‒rU19), while the 3’-\nend tail consists of the ssRb (rG43‒rU51) and the RNA portion of\nthe DNA‒RNA duplex. These tails and the RSL region interact\ntightly with the positively charged surface of the RT domain,\nstabilizing the trimeric assembly (Fig.2d). Each msrRNA tail in one\nprotomer associates with an RT-Toprim from another via\nelectropositive grooves, forming hydrogen bonds between the\nprotein and the RNA bases (Fig.2d).\nIn the solved structure, a 9-nt IRa2 is clearly visible, while only\ntwo complementary bases (rC8 and rA9) of IRa1 are resolved\n(Fig. 2c, f). The 2′,5′-phosphodiester bond between the branched\nguanosine (rG15) and dT1 (the 5′-end of the msdDNA) is observed\nin the density map (Fig.2c, e, f). Theﬁnal 11 nucleotides (rG52‒\nrA62) at the 3′-end of msrRNA and the nucleotides dT57‒dC67 of\nmsdDNA form the DNA‒RNA duplex, which is located within the\nRT active site (Fig. 2c, f). This conﬁguration shows more paired\nbases between the msrRNA template and msdDNA product\ncompared to previous reports\n49,51. Except for dT1 and the DNA\npart of the RNA ‒DNA duplex, the cryo-EM density of the\nremainder of the msdDNA is weaker, indicating less stable binding\nand increased ﬂexibility. Such ﬂexibility, particularly in the DSL\nregion, may facilitate its role as a sensor of phage infection9,11,34,35.\nRetron-Eco2 RT adopts a right-hand-like fold\nThe full-length Eco2 RT-Toprim protein consists of an N-terminal RT\ndomain (residues 1‒368) and a C-terminal Toprim domain (residues\n369‒586). The N-terminal RT domain adopts the characteristic\nright-hand-like fold found in all other known RT structures,\nconsisting of 16 α-helices and 10 β-strands (Fig. 3a).

Wang et al.\n3\nCell Discovery\nfurther reveals structural similarities to RNA-directed RNA poly-\nmerases identiﬁed in various RNA viruses (Supplementary Fig. S3a).\nWe compared several representative RTs from different organisms\nbased on DALI analysis. While the core RT fold is conserved,\nvariations occur in each homologous structure. For example, group\nIIC introns, DRT2, and LINE-1 possess an additional N-terminal\nextension (NTE) domain, while Abi-P2 replaces the thumb domain\nwith a helical domain (Supplementary Fig. S3b–i). Among non-retron\nfamily RTs, Eco2 RT domain shows the highest structural similarity to\nthe prokaryotic DRT2 defense system, which can reverse-transcribe\nneighboring noncoding RNA into tandem repeats that facilitate the\nexpression of a toxic repetitive protein\n56 (Supplementary Fig. S3a, d).\nThe trimer interface of Eco2 RT domain is mediated by a loop\nregion (residues 328 ‒342) primarily through hydrogen bonds\ninvolving amino acids D331, R332, and Y333 (Fig.3b, c). Alanine\nsubstitutions of these residues revealed that R332A abolishes Eco2’s\nantiphage activity, while D331A and Y333A have no obvious effect\n(Fig. 3d). To conﬁrm whether R332A affects trimer formation, we\npuriﬁed the R332A variant and compared it to the wild-type Eco2\ncomplex using SEC. The R332A mutant partially impaired trimer\nassembly, indicating that this loop region alone is insufﬁcient for\ntrimer formation (Supplementary Fig. S4). Collectively, these results\nsuggest that msDNA mediates the trimer formation of the Eco2\ncomplex, while the RT-Toprim protein alone exists as a monomer.\nRetron-Eco2 RT domain forms extensive interactions\nwith msDNA\nAs mentioned above, the base of the Eco2 trimer complex is a\ntrimeric, triangular assembly of three RT domains and three msDNA\nmolecules. The msrRNA portion of msDNA adopts an RSLﬂanked by\n5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails. The RSL is sandwiched between RT\nA\nand RTB domains, with the 5’-end binding RTA and the 3’-end\nbinding RTB, respectively. This arrangement createsﬁve extensive\ninterfaces for RT‒msDNA interaction (Supplementary Fig. S5a). The\n5’-end single-stranded tail primarily contacts the RT A palm\nsubdomain through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions\n(Supplementary Fig. S5b). Notably, the rG15, which is crucial for\nreverse transcription initiation, forms hydrogen bonds with R184. The\nRSL region makes extensive contacts with the RT\nA palm subdomain,\nas well as with Q329/R264 in RTA thumb subdomain and RTB thumb\nsubdomain (Supplementary Fig. S5c, d). Although the Eco2 RSL loop\nsequence (rA30-rA31-rU32) differs from the loop in Eco1 (rU52-rU53-\nrU54), they share a similar conformation. In Eco2, rA30 and rU32\n(Eco1 counterparts rU52 and rU54)ﬂip outwards, while rA31 (Eco1\ncounterpart rU53) base-stacks with rG29 (Eco1 counterpart rG51) and\naromatic residue H281 (Eco1 counterpart H268). These suggest that\nan aromatic residue (a conserved histidine) in the thumb subdomain\nfacilitates the stabilization of the msrRNA loop. The ssRb region in\nthe 3’-end tail is stabilized by interactions with residues F46 and R56\nin theﬁngers subdomain, K245/R247/T249 in the palm subdomain,\nand S253 in the thumb subdomain of RT\nB (Supplementary Fig. S5e).\nThe DNA‒RNA duplex, closely aligned with the catalytic center\nYADD, engages in extensive interactions within the palm and thumb\nsubdomains, stabilizing the catalytic pocket (Supplementary Fig. S5f).\nInsights into the reverse transcription process\nAnalysis of the msdDNA reveals that the last ﬁve nucleotides\n(dC63-dT64-dG65-dC66-dC67) match previous reports, reﬂecting a\nRTC\ndomain\nRTB\ndomain\nPalm\nsubdomain\nPalm\nsubdomain\nRetron-Eco2\nRT domain\n13 6 8  a a\nThumb\nsubdomain\nFingers\nsubdomain\nPalm\nsubdomain\n41 62 251\nβ7β7\nβ6β6\nα1α1\nβ1β1α2α2\nβ5β5\nα5α5\nβ4β4\nα4α4\nβ3β3\nα3α3\nβ2β2\nNN\nCC\nα16α16\nα15α15\nα14α14\nα13α13\nα12α12α11α11\nα10α10\nα9α9\nα8α8 α7α7\nα6α6\nβ8β8\nβ9β9\nβ10β10\nd\na\ncb\nY333BY333B\nR332BR332B\nD331BD331B\nY333cY333c\nR332cR332c\nD331AD331A\nR332AR332A\nRTA\ndomain\nNN\nCC90°\nRT R332A\nRT Y333A\nRT D331A\n 100        10-1      10-2       10-3       10-4      10-5  \nEscherichia phage\nvB_EcoM\nEmpty vector\nWild-type\nmsDNA rG15rA\nToprim E374A/D378A\nRT D201A/D202A\nThumb\nsubdomain\nFingers\nsubdomain\nPalm\nsubdomain\nPalm\nsubdomain\nThumb\nsubdomain\nFingers\nsubdomain\nFig. 3 The trimeric structure of the RT domain. aThe domain organization and atomic model of the Eco2 RT domain with matching colors:\npalm subdomain (slate blue),ﬁngers subdomain (light pink), and thumb subdomain (violet).

Y199 in the YADD motif forms a\nhydrogen bond network with the bases of dG65 and dC66 (which\npair with rG53), while K66 and R70 interact with the phosphate\nbackbone of msrRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5f). The last nucleotide,\ndC67, is positioned near the RT catalytic residues D201 and D202\n(Fig. 4a, b). Interestingly, rU51— poised as the next nucleotide to\nbe reverse-transcribed — is ﬂipped out and stabilized by π‒π\nstacking with an aromatic residue F46 in theﬁngers subdomain\n(Fig. 4b). Additionally, rA49 and rA50 stack with dC67 and rG52\n(the template of dC67), respectively. Replacing F46 with alanine\ncompromised antiphage activity (Fig. 4c) and reduced msDNA\nproduction in vivo (Fig. 4d, e), indicating that F46 is crucial for\nmsDNA synthesis and defense.\nSequence alignment of diverse retron RTs shows this aromatic\nresidue is highly conserved, often as a tyrosine (Fig.4f). Analysis of\nEco1 and Eco2 RTs structures reveals conserved YADD, NAXXH,\nVTG motifs and a similar arrangement of key residues (Supple-\nmentary Fig. S6a, b). In Eco1, the base of rU72 (Eco2 counterpart\nrU51) ﬂips out and formsπ‒π stacking interactions with dA76 and\ndG77 (Supplementary Fig. S6c). The Eco1 aromatic amino acid Y51\n(Eco2 counterpart F46) forms a base-stacking interaction network\nwith dA76, rU72, and dG77. Further antiphage assays showed that\nY51A abolishes Eco1’s defense activity (Supplementary Fig. S6d).\nTogether, these ﬁndings underscore the conserved role of this\naromatic residue in msDNA synthesis and antiphage activity\nacross retron RTs.\nComparison of RT-msDNA complexes among retrons\nThe components of Eco2 differ signiﬁcantly from those of Eco1,\nwhich belongs to the type II retron family, with a standalone\nnucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase-like (NDT) effector\n9,10.I n\ncontrast, Eco2 integrates the RT and Toprim domains into a single\nprotein. The overall structure of the Eco2 RT domain is similar to\nthat of Eco1, with an RMSD of 3.3 Å over 288 residues.\nInterestingly, while Eco2 msrRNA forms a 23-bp RSLﬂanked by\ntwo single-stranded tails that bridge two RT domains, Eco1\nmsDNA adopts a roughlyﬁve-pointed star conﬁguration wrapping\naround a standalone RT (Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Several\nstructural differences in the RT domains may explain their distinct\noligomeric states and msDNA binding modes. For instance, the\nEco2 α1 andα2 helices are antiparallel, whereas they are parallel in\nEco1. In Eco1 the α1 helix mediates the dimer interface, tilting\noutward by ~13° compared to the Eco2α1 helix (Supplementary\nFig. S7c). Another difference is an insertedβ sheet (β-sheet1) in\nthe Eco2 palm domain that could hinder msrRNA binding if it\nadopted an Eco1-like conformation (Supplementary Fig. S7d, e).\nAdditionally, Eco1 msrRNA has an extra RSL region absent in Eco2,\npotentially inﬂuencing whether the msrRNA encircles one RT or\nbridges two (Supplementary Fig. S7b, e). Finally, Eco2’s thumb\ndomain features insertedβ-sheet2, and a long loop that engages\nin mutual interactions among RT monomers in the trimer but do\nnot solely dictate trimer formation (Supplementary Fig. S7f, g).\nEco2 Toprim domain functions as an RNase to mediate\nantiphage activity\nWithin the RT-Toprim fusion protein of Eco2, the C-terminal\nToprim-like effector domain features a central four-stranded\nparallel β-sheet surrounded byα-helices (Fig. 5a, b). DALI analysis\nshows that the effector domain is structurally similar to class 1/2\nOLD nuclease Toprim domains, as well as to effectors from the\nbacterial Gabija and PARIS antiphage defense systems\n41,47,48,57\n(Supplementary Fig. S8). The OLD nuclease Toprim domain\nexhibits processive nuclease activity via a two-metal catalysis\nmechanism57–61.

Wang et al.\n6\nCell Discovery\n(Fig. 5b). Structural and sequence comparison of the Eco2 Toprim\ndomain with the class 2 OLD nuclease (PDB: 6NK8) reveals\nconservation of residues E374/D460/D462 (DxD motif) coordinat-\ning metal A, D378/S513/E515 coordinating metal B, and the\ncatalytic lysine K562 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Alanine substitutions\nin these residues abolished the antiphage activity of Eco2,\nindicating that Toprim enzymatic activity is crucial for its defense\nfunction (Fig. 5c).\nTo investigate the enzymatic activity of the Eco2 Toprim domain,\nwe ﬁrst assessed its potential host toxicity using RT-Toprim fusion\nprotein and truncated Toprim domain constructs. Expression of the\nToprim domain truncations (residues N267‒S586, S300‒S586, and\nN337‒S586) in E. coli resulted in pronounced growth inhibition,\nwhile the full-length RT-Toprim fusion protein exhibited no toxicity\nin spot growth assays (Fig.5d). These results suggest that Toprim\nenzymatic activity is detrimental to the host and may contribute to\nEco2-mediated antiphage defense.\nTo directly evaluate its catalytic function, we puriﬁed the Toprim\ndomain truncation (residues N267‒S586) and assessed its activity\nusing the RNase Alert assay. The wild-type Toprim domain\ndisplayed robust RNase activity, as evidenced by a time-\ndependent increase in ﬂuorescence (Fig. 5e). In contrast, alanine\nsubstitutions in the predicted catalytic residues (E374 and D378)\ndramatically reduced RNase activity (Fig.5e), indicating that the\nobserved cleavage is speciﬁc and dependent on an intact active\nsite.\nWe next performed RNA-seq analysis to determine the\nfunctional consequences of Eco2 activation during phage infec-\ntion. Compared to the empty-vector control, Eco2-expressing cells\ndisplayed a marked downregulation of late phage genes and\nincreased reads for early and middle genes at 15 min and 30 min\npost-infection (Fig. 5f). As successful progression to late gene\nexpression depends on effective translation of earlier gene\nproducts, these data support a model in which Eco2 activation\ndisrupts phage protein synthesis, likely via RNA degradation\nmediated by the Toprim domain.\nCollectively, these ﬁndings reveal that the Retron-Eco2 Toprim\ndomain functions as an RNase, and that this activity underlies its\ntoxicity and Retron-Eco2’s antiphage function.\nPhage-encoded endonuclease IV-like protein DenB triggers\nRetron-Eco2 activation\nThe Toprim domain extends from the RT thumb subdomain and\nhelps stabilize the DNA‒RNA duplex (Supplementary Fig. S10a).\nWe also used AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of the isolated\nRT-Toprim protein. The model revealed a“closed” conformation\ncompared to the more open arrangement observed by cryo-EM\n(Supplementary Fig. S10b, c). Within the resolved region of the\nprotein, basic residues K383, H387, K418, R555, and K557 in the\nToprim domain interact with the phosphate backbone of the RNA\nsegment of the duplex (Supplementary Fig. S10d). To elucidate\nthe functional state of Eco2, we superimposed its Toprim domain\non that of DNA-bound GajA, a known active conﬁguration of the\nGabija defense system\n41. The key catalytic residues of Eco2 are\naligned, yet we detect no Ca2+ density at the active site (Fig.5b;\nSupplementary Fig. S10e). Moreover, the density for much of the\nmsdDNA is absent, which could prevent substrate engagement\nand thus impede Toprim catalysis (Fig. S10f, g). Together with the\nobserved RNase activity and toxicity of the isolated Toprim\ndomain (Fig.5d, e), theseﬁndings support a model in which Eco2\nis maintained in an autoinhibited conformation and becomes\nactivated only upon phage infection, likely through interactions\nwith phage-derived factors.\nTo identify potential phage-encoded triggers of the Retron-\nEco2 system, we isolated and sequenced phage mutants that\nevade the Eco2-mediated defense (escaper phages). Genome\nsequencing of four escapers revealed mutations in the denB\ngene, all featuring a thymine (dT) insertion betweendenB dT192\nand dG193. This insertion results in a frameshift and the\nintroduction of a premature stop codon (Fig. 6a). AlphaFold2-\nbased predictions indicate that denB encodes an endonuclease\nIV-like protein that cleaves single-stranded DNA in a dC-speciﬁc\nmanner\n62,63 (Fig. 6b). Sequence and structural alignments\nrevealed that the DenB protein possesses a conserved ‘PD_D/\nExK’ catalytic motif (Fig. 6c, d). The toxicity of DenB protein\nprevented direct assays to con ﬁrm its activation role. None-\ntheless, the recurring denB mutations in escapers strongly\nsuggest that the denB gene is integral to triggering Eco2\nactivation and that mutations disrupting its expression enable\nphages to circumvent this defense mechanism.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we show that Retron-Eco2 assembles into a\nsupramolecular trimeric complex with a distinctive triangular\nquaternary architecture, distinct from previously reported retron-\neffector complexes\n12,34,35,64 (Fig. 1). Within this trimeric assembly,\neach msrRNA strand of msDNA bridges two RT-Toprim monomers.\nNotably, the formation of a speciﬁc RSL region in msrRNA appears\ncritical for mediating these interactions (Supplementary Fig. S5).\nFunctionally, we show that the Toprim domain of Eco2 exhibits\nRNase activity, providing a mechanistic basis for its role in\nantiphage defense. Furthermore, we identi ﬁed the phage-\nencoded DenB protein as a potential trigger of Eco2 activation.\nTogether, these ﬁndings reveal a new structural principle under-\nlying Retron-Eco2-mediated defense and highlight how diverse\nretron systems may adopt distinct conformations to combat\nphage invasion.\nA central feature of Eco2 is the Toprim effector domain, which\nshares a conserved core fold with other bacterial immune\neffectors\n39,41–44,47,48,65–67 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The functional\ndiversiﬁcation of Toprim domains in bacterial immunity under-\nscores the evolutionary plasticity of this fold7,60,61. For instance,\nGabija cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), Wadjet (JET) targets\nplasmid DNA, and PARIS disrupts host tRNALys to stall transla-\ntion38,42,47. Our biochemical assays and RNA-seq analysis suggest\nthat the Eco2 Toprim domain functions as an RNase upon\nactivation, targeting and degrading RNA to arrest phage devel-\nopment prior to the late stages of infection (Fig.5). Our data, as\nwell as another study\n65, further implicate the phage-encoded\nendonuclease IV-like protein DenB as a trigger for Retron-Eco2\nactivation. We propose that, under normal conditions, theﬂexible\nmsdDNA region occludes the Toprim active site (Supplementary\nFig. S10f, g), maintaining the complex in an autoinhibited\nconformation (Fig. 6e). During phage infection, DenB likely\ndegrades the msdDNA scaffold, thereby relieving steric hindrance\nand enabling the Toprim domain to access and cleave RNA\nsubstrates, ultimately blocking phage replication (Fig.6e).\nFrom a biotechnology standpoint, retrons offer unique advan-\ntages because they naturally generate multiple copies of single-\nstranded DNA. This property has been harnessed for donor DNA\nproduction in genome editing applications across diverse organ-\nisms\n21,23,25,26,30,68–76. Our work provides theﬁrst detailed blueprint\nfor Eco2’s trimeric assembly, setting the stage for structure-guided\noptimization of retron-based editing tools and novel phage\ntherapies. As these genome engineering approaches grow in\nscope and sophistication, reﬁning our structural and mechanistic\nunderstanding of retrons like Eco2 will be essential for advancing\ntheir design.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacteria and phage strains\nEscherichia colistrains [MG1655, DH5α, and BL21(DE3)] were cultured in LB\nor on LB agar at 37 °C with shaking at 210 rpm, unless otherwise stated. To\nmaintain plasmid stability, the media were supplemented with ampicillin\nY.

For protein\nexpression, puriﬁcation, and structural studies, the ncRNA was introduced\ninto pBB75 vector (Novagen), while the coding sequence for RT-Toprim\nprotein was cloned under the control of a T7 promoter into the pET21b\nvector, which includes a C-terminal 8× His tag (His8). For phage challenge\nassays, the Retron-Eco2 genetic unit was assembled through gene splicing\nvia overlap extension PCR and subsequently subcloned into pACYC184\nvectors.

Wang et al.\n8\nCell Discovery\nconstructed using IQ-TREE v.2.3.2 80 with ModelFinder and Ultrafast\nBootstrap set to 1000.\nExpression and puriﬁcation of Retron-Eco2\nFor the protein expression of the Retron-Eco2 complex and its mutants, the\npET21b-rrt-toprim-His8 and pBB75-ncRNA constructs were co-transformed\ninto the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain, plated on LB agar plates, and grown\novernight at 37 °C. A single colony was inoculated into 10 mL of LB\nmedium supplemented with 100μg/mL ampicillin and 50μg/mL kanamy-\ncin as starter culture, and grown at 37 °C with shaking overnight. The\n10 mL starter culture was then added to 1 L of LB medium (supplemented\nwith 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin) and incubated at\n37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until reaching an OD600 of 1.0. The cultures\nwere subjected to cold shock at 16 °C for 30 min and then induced with\n200 μM IPTG. Following induction, the cultures were incubated for a further\n16 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis Buffer containing 25 mM\nTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and subsequently lysed using a pressure\nhomogenizer at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at\n20,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a column\ncontaining Ni\n2+ afﬁnity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen), and the protein complex\nwas eluted using buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole). The\neluate was applied to a Source15Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted\nusing a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 M in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 2 mM\n1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT). The fractions corresponding to a conductivity of\napproximately 35 mS/cm were concentrated to 1 mL and subsequently\npuriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superose6 10/300, GE Health-\ncare) in buffer SD (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT).\nThe RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein, the Toprim domain (N267-S586) and\ncorresponding mutants were expressed from pET21b plasmid in theE. coli\nBL21(DE3) strain. With the exception of the addition of 100 μg/mL\nampicillin during cell culture, all other conditions were consistent with\nthose mentioned previously. For protein puri ﬁcation, cell pellets were\nresuspended in high-salt lysis Buffer 2 (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM\nNaCl), followed by cell lysis and centrifugation to remove cell debris. The\nsupernatant was incubated with Ni\n2+ afﬁnity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) that\nhad been pre-equilibrated with Lysis Buffer. The target protein was eluted\nby Lysis Buffer 2 supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The eluted sample\nwas applied to a Heparin column (GE Healthcare) and subjected to an\nincreasing gradient NaCl elution from 500 mM to 2 M NaCl in 25 mM Tris-\nHCl, pH 8.0 and 2 mM DTT. The fractions containing the target protein were\nconcentrated to 1 mL. The RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein was further puriﬁed\nby gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superose6 10/300, GE Healthcare) in\nbuffer SD (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl) supplemented with 5 mM\nDTT, while the Toprim domain (N267-S586) and its mutants further puriﬁed\nby gel ﬁltration chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300, GE Healthcare)\nwith the same buffer as the RT-Toprim-His8 apo protein.\nFor the Retron-Eco2 complex and RT-Toprim apo protein, UV absorbance\nvalues were measured at 260 nm and 280 nm. Theﬁnal puriﬁed proteins\nwere analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and\n8% -urea-PAGE gel.\nCryo-EM grid preparation and data acquisition\n4 µL aliquots of the freshly puriﬁed Retron-Eco2 complex at an approximate\nconcentration of 1.0 mg/mL were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil Au\nR1.2/1.3 (300 mesh). The grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane after\nblotting for 4.5 s at 100% humidity and 8 °C using a Vitrobot (Mark IV,\nThermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The cryo-grids were then transferred to 300 kV\nTitan Krios electron microscopes (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a GIF\nQuantum energyﬁlter (slit width 20 eV) and a Gatan K3 Summit detector.\nEach image was automatically collected using the EPU software (version 2.9,\nThermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at a magniﬁcation of 81,000×, resulting in a pixel\nsize of 1.07 Å/pix. Each micrograph stack, containing 32 frames, was\nexposed for 3.5 s. The defocus range was between‒1.2 and‒2.2 μm with an\naccumulated total dose of 50 e\n‒/Å2 and determined by Gctf.\nCryo-EM data processing\nA diagram illustrating the procedures for data processing is presented in\nSupplementary Fig. S2. A total of 5092 movie stacks were motion-corrected\nusing MotionCor2, and the resulting micrographs were subjected to Patch\nCTF estimation and correction in cryoSPARC\n81. After manual inspection\nand curation, 4098 micrographs were selected for further processing.\nParticles were automatically picked using blob-picker in combination with\nTopaz, and 3,108,650 particles were extracted with a box size of 240 pixels,\nfollowed by Fourier cropping to 60 pixels. Subsequent 2D classiﬁcation was\nperformed, and 41,623 particles with distinct features were selected for ab\ninitio model generation, resulting in the creation of 10 initial models,\nincluding 1-class, 3-class, and 6-class models. These models were used as\nmulti-references for 3D classiﬁcation. A total of 2,979,419 particles were\nsubjected to two rounds of 3D classi ﬁcation, yielding 1,307,521 high-\nquality particles, which were re-extracted with a box size of 240 pixels and\nsubjected to a third round of 3D classiﬁcation. Finally, a subset of 574,158\nparticles was selected for 3D reﬁnement, resulting in a cryo-EM map with\nan overall resolution of 2.6 Å based on gold-standard Fourier shell\ncorrelation (FSC)\n82.\nModel building and reﬁnement\nFor the atomic model of the Retron-Eco2, the Alphafold2 predicted\nstructure wasﬁtted into the cryo-EM density map using the“ﬁt in the map”\nfunction in UCSF ChimeraX83. The initialﬁtted model was further reﬁned\nthrough manual adjustments in COOT v0.8.9.184. The resulting protein\nmodel was subjected to a rigidﬁt into the the entire cryo-EM density map\nvia the phenix.dock_in_map function of the PHENIX v1.21 software suite85.\nModel quality was assessed using the Molprobity scores 86. Finally,\nstructural ﬁgures were generated via ChimeraX (v.1.2.5).\nPlaquing assays\nPlaque assays were performed as previously described3,9,87.I nb r i e f ,E. coli\nMG1655 containing the retron system or the pACYC184 empty vector was\ncultured. Bacterial lawns were prepared by mixing 200μLo fo v e r n i g h t\ncultures with 7 mL of molten top agar supplemented with 25 μg/mL\nchloromycetin, which was then poured onto LB agar plates. Tenfold serial\ndilutions of a high-titre phage stock were spotted onto the top bacterial layer.\nThe plates were imaged after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The efﬁciency of\nplating (EOP) was measured and compared between the plaque assay results\nfor control bacteria and those containing the defense system. The activity of\nwild-type Retron-Eco2 system and its mutants were assessed by performing\nEOP assays withEscherichiaphage vB_EcoM, while retron Eco1 system and its\nmutants were infected with phage K42.\nIsolation of escaper bacteriophages that overcome defense\nTo isolate mutant bacteriophages that escape the Retron-Eco2 defense\nsystem, phages were plated on LB agar plates containing bacteria\nexpressing the wild-type Retron-Eco2 system using a double-layer plaque\nassay\n9,87. Overnight cultures ofE. coli MG1655 containing the Retron-Eco2\ndefense system were diluted 1:50 and grown at 37 °C with shaking for 1.5 h\nuntil reaching an OD600 of 0.3. 200μL of the culture was mixed with 7 mL\nof pre-melted 0.5% MMB agar containing chloromycetin and poured onto\nagar plates. 2μL drops of tenfold serial diluted bacteriophage vB_EcoM\nwere spotted onto the bacterial top layer. The double-layer plates were\nincubated overnight at 37 °C, and single plaques were picked into 90μLo f\nphage buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM MgCl\n2, 10 mM NaCl). The phage\nsolutions were mixed several times by vortexing to release the phages\nfrom the agar into the phage buffer, and then centrifuged at 2000×g for\n10 min to pellet debris. The supernatant containing the mutant phages\nwas sterile-ﬁltered and transferred into a new tube. The collected phages\nwere tested for their ability to infect both a control strain and a Retron-\nEco2 operon-carrying strain, and their phenotype was checked and\ncompared to that of the parental bacteriophage vB_EcoM through plaque\nassays, as described above.\nAmpliﬁcation of phages\nAmpliﬁcation of phages was performed as previously described 9,87.\nParental bacteriophages were propagated in E. coli MG1655 containing\nan empty vector, while escaper phages were more effectively propagated\non the Retron-Eco2 operon-carrying strain. TheEscherichia phage vB_EcoM\nwas propagated in a liquid culture of bacteria grown in MMB medium to\nan OD600 of 0.3. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm,\nthe lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000×g, and the supernatant was\nﬁltered through a 0.22μM ﬁlter to remove remaining bacterial cell debris.\nThe phage titer was determined using the plaquing assay.\nmsDNA isolation\nmsDNA isolation was performed as described previously9,11. Brieﬂy, 25 mL\ncultures of E. coli MG1655 expressing wild-type Retron-Eco2 defense\nsystem and its mutant from the native promoter were grown in LB\nY. Wang et al.\n9\nCell Discovery\nmedium supplemented with chloromycetin at 37 °C with shaking at\n200 rpm. Overnight cultures were centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min. The\nsupernatants were discarded, and the cell pellets were resuspended in\n200 μL of Solution I (50 mM glucose, 10 mM EDTA and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n8.0). Next, 200μL of Solution II (0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS) was added, and the\nmixture was inverted gently ten times. Subsequently, 400μL of Solution III\n(3 M potassium acetate, 2 M acetic acid) was added, and the samples were\nmixed again by inverting the tubes ﬁve times. After centrifugation, the\nsupernatant was precipitated overnight at ‒80 °C with ethanol. The\nprecipitated nucleic acids were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C,\nand the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice with\n1 mL of 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The\npellets were air-dried for 15–30 min at room temperature and resuspended\nin 20μL diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The puriﬁed nucleic\nacids containing msDNA were treated with RNase A for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The samples were then incubated with loading buffer (90%\nformamide, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% (w/v)\nbromophenol blue 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol) at 100 °C for 5 min and\nsubjected to 12% denaturing Urea-PAGE using 1× Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer\n(150 V, 1 h). The urea-PAGE gels were strained with 4S GelRed.\nRNase alert assay\nTo detect the RNase activity of Toprim domain, we used RNase Alert kit\n(APExBIO, Cat. No. K1902). The RNase Alert kit, based on the principle of\nFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), is capable of detecting\nRNase activity with high sensitivity. We co-incubated the puriﬁed Toprim\ndomain with ssRNA provided in the kit at 37 °C and performed\nﬂuorescence detection using SpectraMax\n® i3x, with an excitation\nwavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Culves\nwere analyzed and generated using GraphPad Prism v.8.0.2.\nDetection of the phage genes expression using RNAseq\nFor each sample,E. coli MG1655 cells containing the Retron-Eco2 defense\nsystem or the pACYC184 empty vector were grown in 10 mL of LB medium\nat 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until reaching an OD600 of 0.3. The\ncultures were infected withEscherichia phage vB_EcoM at a multiplicity of\ninfection (MOI) of 5. RNA was extracted from the cells using Bacterial Total\nRNA Rapid Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech, Order NO. B518625) at 15 min\nand 30 min post-infection, as previously described. Brie ﬂy, cells were\ncollected by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellets were\nincubated with 100 μL of lysozyme (400 μg/mL) for 5 min at room\ntemperature. Next, 900μL of Buffer Rlysis-B was added, and the mixture\nwas vortexed immediately before incubated for 5 min at room tempera-\nture. Subsequently, 200μL of chloroform was added, and the tubes were\nmixed. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The\nsupernatant was precipitated with one-third volume of ethanol for 3 min at\nroom temperature and then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The\npellets were washed twice with 750μL of 75% ethanol, centrifuged again\nat 14,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, air-dried for 10 min, resuspended in\n30–50 μL of DEPC-treated ddH\n2O, and stored at–80 °C. All the experiments\nwere performed with two biological replicates. The extracted RNA was sent\nto Seqhealth Technology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China) for subsequent cDNA\nlibrary preparation, and high-throughput sequencing using Illumina\nsequencing platform (Novaseq 6000). Differentially expressed genes were\nidentiﬁed using EdgeR based on pairwise comparison (the criteria BH-\nadjusted P < 0.05 and |log2 Fold Change | > 1).\nQuantiﬁcation and statistical analysis\nDetails of speciﬁc statistical tests are provided in theﬁgure legends.

Graham1,S t e v e nZ .D e L u c a1 & Blake Wiedenheft1\nReverse transcriptases (RTs) have well-established roles in the replication and\nspread of retroviruses and retrotransposons. However, recent evidence sug-\ngests that RTs have been conscripted by cells for diverse roles in antiviral\ndefence. Here we determine structures of a type I-A retron, which explain how\nRNA, DNA, RT, HNH-nuclease and four molecules of a structure maintenance\nof chromosome (SMC)-family ATPase assemble into a 364 kDa complex that\nprovides phage defence. We show that phage-encoded nucleases trigger\ndegradation of the retron-associatedDNA, leading to activation of the HNH\nnuclease. The HNH nuclease cleaves tRNA\nSer, stalling protein synthesis and\narresting viral replication. Taken together, these data reveal diverse and\nparadoxical roles for RTs in the perpetuation and elimination of genetic\nparasites.\nReverse Transcriptases (RTs) were originally discovered in Rous Sar-\ncoma and murine leukemia viruses1,2. Over the next several decades,\nresearch on RTs suggested that these enzymes are primarily involved\nin the replication of sel ﬁsh genetic elements, and occasionally\ndomesticated for cellular functions ( e.g., telomerase and\nspliceosome)\n3,4. Initially, RTs were thought to be restricted to the\neukaryotic domain of life5–7,b u ti n1 9 8 9 ,t h r e ei n d e p e n d e n tg r o u p s\ndiscovered RTs in bacteria that make multicopy single-stranded DNA\n(msDNA) using an RNA template\n8–10. These systems were called\nretrons6, but the biological function of these systems remained enig-\nmatic for almost 30 years11. Recently, these systems have been shown\nto provide bacteria with defence against phage infection12–14.\nRetrons are diverse (i.e., 13 types and several subtypes), but all\nretrons consist of an RT with two distinguishing sequence motifs\n(NAXXH and VTG), and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) containing an\ninverted repeat and an invariant guanosine that acts as a primer for\nbranched DNA synthesis\n5,15,16. Most retrons are associated with putative\neffectors, that are predicted to interact with cell membranes, cleave\nDNA, or degrade proteins\n13,15,17,18. To date, the only available retron\nstructure is that of the type II-A3 (Eco1/Ec86) system19–21. These struc-\ntures reveal an oligomeric assembly of retrons that sequester an NAD+-\nhydrolyzing toxin, which is activated either by phage-induced\nmethylation of msDNA or, in the case of the type II-A1 retron, by\nmsDNA degradation mediated by the prophage-encoded exonuclease\nVIII, recE\n17,19,21.\nWith the growing appreciation for the functional diversity of\nprokaryotic RTs in antiphage defence13,22,23, we were particularly intri-\ngued by a class of RTs that are uniquely associated with Structural\nMaintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) ATPases\n15.S M CA T P a s e sa r e\nconserved across all domains of life, perform critical functions in\norganizing higher-order chromosome structures, and facilitate DNA\nrepair\n24,25. Intriguingly, SMC ATPases play critical roles in antiviral\nimmunity in both eukaryotic (e.g., human Smc5/6 and Rad50)26–28 and\nprokaryotic organisms (e.g., PARIS29–31, Wadjet32–34,L a m a s s u35–37,a n d\nGabija37,38). While RTs that synthesize extrachromosomal DNA and\nATPases that recognize foreign DNA are independently recognized as\ncomponents of antiviral defence, their unique association in type I-A\nretrons—sometimes called type II Septu\n39—raises fundamental ques-\ntions about their functional synergy.\nHere we clarify the functional interplay between RTs and SMC-\nfamily ATPases in type I-A retrons. We determine three different\nstructures, which explain how RT-generated extrachromosomal\nmsDNA serves as the structural core of a 364 kDa complex composed\nof the RT, a portion of the non-coding RNA, msDNA, two ATPase\nReceived: 20 February 2025\nAccepted: 11 August 2025\nCheck for updates\n1Montana State University, Bozeman, Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Bozeman, MT, USA.2These authors contributed equally: Jerrin Thomas\nGeorge, Nathaniel Burman. e-mail: bwiedenheft@gmail.com\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8459 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nhomodimers, and an HNH nuclease. Upon infection, a phage encoded\nnuclease cleaves the msDNA, potentially triggering disassembly of the\ncomplex leading to activation of the HNH nuclease. The activated HNH\nselectively degrades cellular tRNA\nSer, arresting translation and stalling\nphage replication. Collectively, the structures, structure-guided\nmutants, phage challenge assays, and biochemical experiments pre-\nsented here reveal how RT-generated extrachromosomal DNA—once\nviewed as a hallmark of selﬁsh elements—acts as a crucial host factor\nthat relies on SMC ATPases for antiviral defence.\nResults\nThe type I-A retron system protects bacteria against phages\nThe type I-A retron system consists of a ncRNA, RT, msDNA, ATPase,\nand HNH nuclease (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b)15.H e r ew ef o c u s\non a type I-A retron we identiﬁed in the FORC 82 strain ofEscherichia\ncoli. To determine if theE. coliFORC 82 retron provides phage defence,\nwe cloned the operon along with ~550 bases of the upstream DNA,\nwhich is expected to encode the ncRNA (Fig. 1a)\n15.T h er e t r o n -\ncontaining plasmid or an empty vector control was transformed intoE.\ncoli MG1655, and plaque assays were performed using T3, T4, T5, and\nT7 phages. While the retron conferred defence against T3 and T5, no\nimmunity was observed against T4 or T7 (Fig.1b, Supplementary\nFig. 1c). Notably, the level of defense was stronger against T3 than T5,\nsuggesting potential differences in how these phages activate or evade\nretron-mediated immunity.\nTo assess the role of each protein component in phage immunity,\nwe introduced active site mutations in the ATPase (D387A), HNH\nnuclease (H71A), or the RT (YADD to YAAA). Mutations in the ATPase or\nHNH active sites eliminate retron-based phage defence, while attempts\nto clone mutations in the RT active site (YADD to YAAA) consistently\nfailed, suggesting that these mutants are toxic (Supplementary Fig. 1d,\nSupplementary Data 1). Persistent attempts to clone the RT mutant\nresulted in the emergence of compensatory mutations in the ATPase\n(Q454K) or the HNH (G44S) and the ATPase (V73A) that rendered the\ndefence system inactive (Supplementary Fig. 1e, Supplementary\nData 1). Attempts to revert the ATPase Q454K mutation yielded 13\nclones, all of which carried the intended reversion (K454Q) but also\ncontained frameshift mutations within the ATPase, indicating con-\ntinued selective pressure to mitigate toxicity. These results demon-\nstrate that all protein components of theE. coliFORC82 retron system\nare indispensable for defence, consistent with observations reported\nfor retron Ec78\n12,13.\nGiven the involvement of multiple proteins, DNA, and RNA in the\ntype I-A retron defence system, we hypothesized that the retron forms\na multicomponent complex capable of recognizing phages and con-\nferring immunity. To purify the complex, weﬁrst identiﬁed the 5’ and 3’\nboundaries of the ncRNA by developing a covariation model built by\naligning regions upstream of type I-A retron RTs (Fig.1c). The model\nreveals a long stem-loop structure consistent with previous\nobservations\n15. The predicted non-coding RNA and each of the protein-\ncoding genes were cloned into an expression vector with afﬁnity tags\non either the C-terminus of the HNH nuclease (HNH-Strep), the\nN-terminus of the RT (Strep-RT), or the N-terminus of the ATPase\n(Strep-ATPase). Placement of the afﬁnity tags was informed using\nstructural predictions, which indicated that the N-terminus of the HNH\nnuclease would be buried, while the C-termini of both the RT and\nATPase were avoided due to predicted interactions with adjacent\nproteins or the ncRNA.

The\nafﬁnity-puriﬁed complex elutes from size-exclusion chromatography\n(SEC) as a monodispersed peak with an estimated molecular weight of\n350 kDa. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry were used to identify all\nthree protein components (i.e., ATPases, RT, and HNH), while dena-\nturing urea-PAGE and nucleases assays were used to identify the ~90\nnucleotide msDNA, and a ~ 40 nucleotide ncRNA (Fig.1d, e, Supple-\nmentary Data 2). Ourﬁndings suggest that all components of the type\nI-A retron assemble into a multicomponent complex that is necessary\nfor phage defence.\nThe puriﬁed complex was used for structure determination\nusing cryo-EM (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary\nTable 1). 2D classiﬁcation revealed that a subset of particles con-\ntained an extra lobe of asymmetric density. This was reﬂected in\ninitial 3D reconstructions which contained weak density for the\nadditional domain. Focused 3D classiﬁcation performed using a soft\nmask over the area of weak density produced three distinct struc-\ntures with overall resolutions of 3.1 Å (Fig.1f, Supplementary Fig. 3).\nPreliminary models of the complex were built by docking\nAlphaFold3\n40 predicted structures into the maps. This process\nrevealed that the RT and a portion of the ncRNA comprise the head\nof the assembly, while the msDNA protrudes from the RT like a\nharpoon that extends all the way through the center of the complex.\nThe HNH nuclease is asymmetrically bound to one of the two\nATPase homodimers, in either an up or down conﬁguration. Com-\nparison between the HNH-up, HNH-down, and no-HNH structures\nrevealed minimal structural differences between the shared sub-\nunits. The RMSD of each of the shared subunits in each of the three\nstructures was less than 0.7 Å. Notably, density for the C-terminal\nregion of the ATPase—which interacts with the HNH subunit—was\nonly visible in the HNH-bound structures.\nExtrachromosomal DNA synthesized by RT is a scaffold for the\nSMC ATPase\nTo understand how reverse transcription leads to formation of the\nretron, we compared an AlphaFold3-predicted structure of the ncRNA-\nRT complex to the experimentally determined structure of the retron\ncomplex (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast to the experimentally determined\nstructure (i.e., post-assembly), the predicted structure is likely to\nrepresent an early intermediate. In both the predicted and experi-\nmentally determined structures, stem-loop 1 (SL-1) forms a molecular\nhandle that interacts with the thumb domain of the RT and likely\nremains anchored to the RT\n41,42, while the RNA template is reeled\nthrough the active site during reverse transcription (Fig.2a–d, Sup-\nplementary Fig. 4a, c).\nIn the predicted ncRNA-RT structure, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the\nncRNA form a conserved stem-loop (SL-3) that is positioned within a\ncleft of the RT formed by the thumb and palm domains (Fig.2a–c)43.\nThe prediction places the branching guanosine of the ncRNA, which\nserves as the primer for reverse transcription, near the VTG motif and\nthe YADD active site (Fig.2c)\n15,16. Reeling of the RNA template into the\nRT active site is anticipated to require unzipping the predicted stem of\nthe ncRNA, and displacement of SL-3.\nThe clamp (CL) is a highly conserved feature of the ncRNA\n(Fig. 2a). This sequence is predicted to interact with the palm domain\nof the RT, prior to reverse transcription, while in the experimentally\ndetermined structure, the clamp is a linchpin that simultaneous con-\ntacts the 3′-end of the cDNA, the ATPase, and key domains of the RT,\nincluding theﬁnger, palm, and VTG motif (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e).\nCollectively, these structural comparisons suggest that during reverse\ntranscription, the 3′ end of the ncRNA is reeled through the active site\nand into the cleft formed by the thumb and palm domain (initially\noccupied by SL-3) while the SL-1 handle remains bound by the RT.\nReeling of the template positions the 3′ end of the msDNA and the\nncRNA termination sequence (TS) in close proximity, forming an RNA-\nDNA hybrid at the site previously occupied by SL-3 (Supplementary\nFig. 4d, e).\nThe ATPase homodimers form an extensive network of electro-\nstatic interactions with the msDNA (Fig.2e, Supplementary Fig. 5a).\nNotably, a cluster of basic residues within insertion sequence 1 (IS1)—a\nconserved feature of SMC ATPases—is oriented towards the msDNA-\nbinding cavity (Fig.2e)\n25. However, IS1 is dynamic and density for IS1 is\nweak (Movie 1). While single-point mutants (K100A, K103A, K109A,\nK141A, N151A, N152A, K196A, or K201A) at residues involved in msDNA\nbinding had no detectable impact on phage defense (Supplementary\nFig. 5b), a single construct with multiple charge-swap mutations in IS1\nwere unclonable (R195E, K196E, R197E, K198E, K201E, and K203E),\nsuggesting toxicity (Fig.2e). Similarly, structure-guided mutations that\ndisrupt the interface between the RT and ATPase (RT residues: S217R,\nN219R and E220R) were also unclonable (Fig.2f). In contrast, these\nmutants were successfully cloned in constructs with limited retron\nexpression. Together, theseﬁndings underscore the critical role of\nmsDNA and RT in orchestrating ATPase assembly, which is essential for\nthe functional integrity of the retron.\nSMC ATPases typically dimerize in the presence of ATP and play a\ncentral role in forming chromosomal structures that mediate DNA\nrepair\n24,25. Insertion sequence 2 (IS2) is a conserved feature of SMC\nATPases that forms long coiled-coil domains, which wrap around\ngenomic DNA\n25,44. In retrons, the ATPase dimers are offset by ~75°\nrelative to each other and coiled-coils from two adjacent ATPases\nencircle the extrachromosomal msDNA in an ATPase-mediated bear\nhug on one side of the complex and a dorsalﬁns h a p e ds t r u c t u r eo n\nthe other (Fig.2g–i). While the IS2-mediated bear hug obscures access\nto the msDNA, 3D variability analysis reveals a subset of particles with\nan alternate conformation, where the IS2 arms are disordered and the\nmsDNA is exposed (Movie 1). Collectively, this reveals a conserved role\nfor IS2 in binding chromosomal DNA during repair or msDNA during\nretron assembly.\nATPase homodimers form a claw that grasps the HNH nuclease\nThe HNH nuclease is anchored to the retron complex via the\nC-terminal extension of the ATPase, which forms a triple helix\n(Figs. 1a, 3a, b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1b). The C-terminal triple helix\nfrom adjacent subunits form a claw-like structure that grips the\nC-terminal region of the HNH nuclease and structure guided muta-\ntions in ATPase (D522R, L523R, V526R, F529A, and K530D) result in a\ncomplete loss of defence (Fig.3a, b, d). The nuclease is asymme-\ntrically recruited to one side of the complex (i.e., one pair of\nC-terminal extensions) in either an up or down orientation (Fig.1f).\nExclusion of the HNH from the opposing homodimer is partially\nexplained by steric hindrance from the RT. In addition, three of the\nfour ATPase nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) include clear den-\nsity for ATP, while the fourth NBD (NBD4) is reordered in a way that is\nincompatible with ATP binding (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). This\narrangement and exclusion of ATP from this NBD is consistent\nbetween the HNH-bound and HNH-free structures, demonstrating\nthat the unique pose of NBD4 occurs during assembly rather than\nduring HNH binding. Structural comparison with the type-I Septu\nATPase (PDB: 8EEA) reveals a similar pattern of ATP exclusion, sug-\ngesting a conserved function in complex assembly, as opposed to\nHNH binding (Supplementary Fig. 6e)\n45.\nWhile mutations in the RT active site result in toxicity, a sponta-\nneous mutation in the ATPase (Q454K) renders the RT active site\nmutants non-toxic. Q454 is conserved across type I-A retron ATPases,\nand the structure explains a role for this residue in stabilizing the claw-\nlike structure (Fig.3c). Although Q454 does not directly interact with\nthe HNH nuclease, the Q to K mutation leads to a complete loss of\ndefence, highlighting the importance of the claw-like structure in\nrecruitment of the HNH (Fig.3d).\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63285-6\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8459 3\nThe msDNA is a phage sensor\nBuilding on our structural understanding, we hypothesized that\nretron activation is triggered by speciﬁc components of the infecting\nphage. To test this hypothesis, we screened for phage mutants that\nescape retron-mediated defence. Cells expressing the retron defence\nsystem were infected with phages T3 and T5. Three T3 escape\nmutants were isolated, but no escapers were recovered for T5\ndespite repeated attempts (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Whole-genome\nsequencing of the T3 escape mutants revealed mutations inﬁve\nphage genes (i.e., serine/threonine kinase, an exonuclease, a small\nhypothetical protein, a tail protein, and a tailﬁber), and the insertion\nof three guanosines between two genes (YP_009792963.1 and\nYP_009792964.1) (Fig.4a). While serine/threonine kinase was toxic\nby itself, phage tailﬁber, phage tail protein, and the exonuclease\nwere expressed either alone or in retron-containing cells. Co-\nexpression of the exonuclease with the retron severely impaired\nbacterial growth, whereas no growth defect was observed when the\nexonuclease was expressed alone or with a retron containing an\ninactive HNH nuclease (H71A) (Fig.4b, c). These results indicate that\nT3 exonuclease triggers retron-mediated immunity.\n“Dorsal fin”“Bear hug”\n  direct\nrepeats \n   G\n   C\n   U\n   C\n   U\n   U\n   U\n   A   U\n   \nG\n   \nU   G   G   A   A\n   C   A   U   U\n   G   G    U   U   C   C\n   A   G   CC   G   G   G   U   G   A   U\n   U   A    G    C    C   A    G G    C    U\n   U\n   A\n   A\n   A\n   U\n   U\n   U   A   U   U    G    U    C\n   \nC    G    G    U    U   U   A   G\n   G\n   G\n   U\n   U\n   G    C    G    A\n   U   C   G   C\n   U\n   G\n   U\n   C\n   U   direct\nrepeats U   A   G\n   \nU\n   G   A\n   A\n   G\n   A\n   G\n   U\n   A    A    G    A    C    A    C    A    G    A U    U    U    C    U    C    C\n   G   G   A   G   A   A   A   U   C   U   G   UG   U   C   U   U    U    U    C    G    C    A\n   U   C    C    C    U    G   C   C\n   C\n   G\n   G\n   G   G   C   A   G   A   U\n   A\n   U   G   C   G   A   A\nSL-1\nCL\n.SL-2\nA\n5’3’\nmsrRNA\n(scaffold)\nmsdRNA\n(template)\nTS\nSL-3\nSL-1\nAlphafold3 prediction \nof RT-ncRNA  \n(reverse transcription initiation)\nSL-3 msDNA\n5’\n3’\nTS\n5’\na\nb\nc d cryo-EM structure of \nthe surveillance complex\n(reverse transcription termination)\nSL-1\nmsrRNA\n(scaffold)\nmsdRNA\n(template)\nRT\nTS\nSL-2\n5’\n3’\nCL\nSL-3\nthumb\npalm\nYADD\nG\nVTG Finger\nCL\nVTG\nYADD\nFinger\nthumb\nSL-13’\n3’\npalm\nA\n2’ priming\nsite\n75˚\nDimer 1\nDimer 2\nh\n i\nf\nATPase homodimer \nside view\ng\nRT\nATPase\nmsDNA\nHNH\nncRNA\nATPase\nmsDNA\n90°\n3’\nATP\nATP\nmsDNA\nHNH\nncRNA\nI\nY\nG\nG\nVDRKRKN\nA\nK\nT\nR\nK\nR\nK N A\nV\nD\nR\nK\nR\nK\nN\nRK\nN AK\nT\nK\nK\nT\ne\n2’\nreverse \ntranscription \nstart site\nS217\nP214\nK35\nE220\nQ100\nG\n202 188\n195\n200\n193\n199\n196\n204\nFig. 2 | RT synthesizes a DNA‘harpoon’that stabilizes the complex. aThe ncRNA\nsequence of retron I-A fromE. coliis mapped onto the covariance model shown in\nFig. 1c.

Co-expression of\nthe T3 W48R exonuclease mutant with the retron did not result in cell\ngrowth arrest, suggesting that retron activation is dependent on spe-\nciﬁc structural features beyond the active site (Fig.4c). Mapping the\nremaining escaper mutations on the exonuclease structure revealed\nthat none of the mutations occurred at the active site (Supplementary\nFig. 7d). This suggests that the exonuclease activity is not required for\nretron activation, or this activity is essential for phage replication and\nmutations that disrupt its function are not tolerated. To determine\nwhether the exonuclease directly degrades msDNA, acts indirectly\nthrough other cellular nucleases, or has no impact on msDNA integrity,\nwe mutated the exonuclease active site (D162K) and co-expressed the\nmutant or the wild-type (WT) exonuclease in retron containing cells.\nCo-expression of the T3 exonuclease active site mutant (D162K) or T3\nphage escaper mutant (W48R) with retron results in no growth arrest\nand no degradation of the msDNA, while the WT exonuclease results in\nboth growth arrest and msDNA degradation (Fig.4c, d, Supplementary\nFig. 7b, c). Collectively, these data demonstrates that the T3 exonu-\nclease triggers retron activation, that residues outside of the active site\nare necessary for retron-mediated recognition of the trigger, and that\nt h en u c l e a s ea c t i v es i t ei sn e c e s s a r yf o rd e g r a d i n gt h em s D N A .\nTo better understand the mechanism of retron activation by the\nT3 exonuclease, we identiﬁed and compared related nucleases using a\ncombination of AlphaFold3\n40 and FoldSeek46 (Supplementary Fig. 7d,\ne). T3 exonuclease is structurally similar to the T4, T5, and T7ﬂap\nnucleases that have been proposed to remove Okazaki fragments\n(Supplementary Fig. 7e)\n47–50. The T3, T5 (D15), and T7 nucleases trigger\ngrowth arrest in retron-expressing cells, whereas the T4-encoded\nnuclease had no detectable effect on cell growth (Fig.4c, e). Consistent\nwith this observation, expression of nucleases from T3, T5, and T7 led\nto msDNA cleavage, but the nuclease from T4 fails to cleave msDNA\n(Supplementary Fig. 7f). While growth inhibition by T3 and T5\nnucleases in retron-expressing cells aligns with the observed immunity\nagainst these phages, T7 phage evades retron-mediated defence,\ndespite its nuclease triggering degradation of the msDNA. This sug-\ngests that msDNA cleavage occurs at reduced levels or slower rates\nduring a T7 infection as compared to the overexpression system, or\nthat T7 encodes an anti-retron mechanism that occurs downstream of\nmsDNA degradation. While more work remains to be done regarding\nthe mechanism of retron evasion by T7, our results suggest that retron-\nmediated protection generally correlates with nuclease-mediated\ncleavage of msDNA.\nRetron activation triggers translation arrest\nThe type I Septu defence system, composed of an ATPase and an HNH\nnuclease, degrades viral DNA during infection45.

This deletion elim-\ninates 10 of the 25 tRNAs including a tRNASer containing a GCT antic-\nodon (tRNASer-GCT), which decodes a highly represented codon in\nboth the T5 andE. coligenomes (Supplementary Fig. 9e). The deletion\nof T5 encoded tRNAs may occur spontaneously during serial passage\nof the virus in the absence of selective pressures (e.g., immune sys-\ntems). To investigate whether phage-supplemented tRNAs contribute\nto evasion of retron immunity, we cloned and expressed tRNA\nSer-GCT\nin cells infected with T5 MSU, which is missing tRNA Ser-GCT\n(Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). Surprisingly, supplementation did not\nconfer detectable evasion of retron-mediated phage defense. North-\nern blot analysis of total RNA from cells co-expressing T5 tRNA\nSer-GCT,\nthe wild-type retron, and the T3 exonuclease revealed a distinct clea-\nvage band for both E. coli and T5 tRNA\nSer-GCT (Supplementary\nFig. 10c). In contrast, this cleavage band was absent in cells expressing\nthe HNH-inactive retron. We next asked whether the previously iden-\ntiﬁed retron inhibitor gene (ORF75), in combination with phage-\nencoded tRNAs, is necessary for phage evasion of the retron\n54.T o\naddress this, we obtained a T5 phage isolate from ATCC (T5ATCC)a n d\na b\nDAPI fluorescence intensity\nretron HNH (H71A) + \nT3 exonuclease\nWT retron + \nT3 exonuclease\nE. coli cell \nmembrane\n10 μm deleted region\nin T5MSU\n27k 30k 33k 36k 42k\nT5\ngenome\n//\n39k\n32.9 41.4k\ntSer-GCTtSer-GGA\ntSer-TGA\nlog2 (fold change)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n−1.5 −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n−log10 (P value)\nnot significant\nsignificant\ntSer-UGA-1-1\ntSer-CGA-1-1\ntSer-GGA-1-1\ntSer-GCU-1-1\ndown-\nregulated\nup-\nregulated\nc\nd\nE. coli tRNASer\ncleavage\ncell\ndormancy\nmsDNA degradation \nand potential disassembly\nT3 flap\nnuclease\nmsDNA \nbiogenesis\nmsDNA recruits \nSMC ATPase\nHNH \nrecruitment\ntype I-A retron\ncomplex\n180°\nHNH\ndimer ?\nunknown \nretron\ninhibitor?\nT7 flap\nnuclease\n(degrades\nmsDNA)\nT3\nT7\nevades\nretron\nsensitive\nto retron\nFig. 5 | HNH nuclease degradesE. colitRNASer.a Fluorescence microscopy images\nfor WT or HNH-inactive (H71A) retron in the presence of T3 exonuclease.

The RT\nreverse-transcribes a ncRNA into an extrachromosomal DNA that recruits SMC\nATPases. The HNH toxin is recruited. Upon infection, phageﬂap nuclease degrades\nthe msDNA, potentially releasing the HNH, which depletesE. colitRNASer.T h eﬂap\nnuclease from T7 degrades msDNA, but T7 is resistant to type I-A retron mediated\ndefense, suggesting a virally encoded anti-retron.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63285-6\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8459 7\nperformed whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b).\nThe T5ATCC genome includes the full complement of phage tRNAs\n(including tRNASer) and ORF75. However, phage challenge assays\nrevealed that T5ATCC does not evade FORC 82 retron immunity. Thus,\nin contrast to retron Ec78 described by Azam et al.54, neither T5-\nencoded tRNAs nor ORF75 contribute to evasion of FORC 82 retron\nimmunity. Instead, ourﬁndings demonstrate that the FORC 82 retron\ncan cleave host and phage-encoded tRNA\nSer.\nFinally, we investigated how viral tRNAs differ fromE. colitRNAs\nthat enable retron-mediated elimination by retron Ec78 yet remain\nineffective against retron FORC-82. We alignedE. coli tRNA\nTyr and\ntRNASer sequences with their counterparts encoded in the WT T5\ngenome (Supplementary Fig. 11). Notably, most differences between\nthe phage andE. colitRNAs cluster in or around the D-loop, a region\nrecognized by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases\n56. To determine if D-loop\nvariation in tRNAs is a more general theme, we alignedE. colitRNAs to\neach of the corresponding tRNAs in T5. All 23 tRNAs in the T5 genome\ncontain D-loop mutations relative to analogous isoaccepters inE. coli.\nHowever, mutations were not restricted to the D-loop, which is con-\nsistent with a wider spectrum of nucleases that target tRNA degrada-\ntion and modiﬁcation\n29,31,57,58.\nDiscussion\nThe competing selﬁsh interest of viruses and their hosts results in a\nbiological tit-for-tat that necessitates perpetual innovation to avoid\nextinction\n59–61. As part of this process, genes with one function are\noften conscripted, repurposed, or swapped between the competing\ninterests in ways that (temporarily) enhance ﬁtness62,63.H e r ew e\ndetermine structures, perform structure-guided mutations, phage\nchallenge assays, and biochemical experiments that collectively\nexplain how bacteria and archaea use RTs to generate extra-\nchromosomal DNA, that serves as a scaffold to recruit SMC ATPases\nand HNH nucleases for antiviral defence. The experimentally deter-\nmined structure and structure predictions add new insight to the\nprocess of reverse transcription, and explain how the RT links the\nn c R N Aa n dm s D N At oap a i ro fS M CA T P a s eh o m o d i m e r s( F i g .5d).\nInsertion sequences 1 and 2 (IS1 and IS2), both characteristic features\nof SMC ATPases, play distinct structural roles: IS1 interacts with the\nmsDNA, while IS2 stabilizes the ATPase homodimer through bear hug\nand dorsalﬁn features. Further, the C-terminal extensions from two\nopposing ATPase subunits form a claw-like structure that engages the\nHNH nuclease, whereas the corresponding regions in the other two\nsubunits are disordered (Fig.1). The mechanism by which only a single\nHNH is recruited per retron, as well as the functional implications of\nthe up, down, or no HNH conﬁgurations, remains unclear.\nThe C-terminal claw of the ATPase and the HNH are structurally\nsimilar to that previously reported for Septu (RMSD = 1.1 Å across 56\natom pairs, and 2.7 Å across all 84 pairs) (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b)\n45.\nHowever, Septu systems do not involve RTs, the HNH is reported to be\na DNase rather than an RNase, and the viral activator is unknown45.T h e\nHNH structure reported here is nearly identical to the HNH from Septu\n(RMSD = 1.1 Å across 101 pruned atom pairs), so it remains unclear how\nsubtle structural differences result in distinct biological outcomes.\nNevertheless, the ability of retron-associated HNHs to cleave tRNAs\nmakes them unique among HNH family nucleases that are frequently\nassociated with DNA cleavage\n64.\nPhage-encoded nucleases trigger msDNA degradation, but the\nmechanism of degradation remains unclear. According to the struc-\nture, the msDNA and/or ncRNA are vulnerable to nuclease activity at\nthe head (SL1, SL2 and/or SL3), the body (shaft of the msDNA), or the\npoorly ordered tip of the msDNA, which includes 12 unmodeled bases\nthat extend beyond the ATPases. Initially we suspected the tip, because\nit is most exposed and because the covariance model predicts high\nvariability in this region, which could reﬂect a mechanism for identi-\nfying different phage triggers. However, truncation of the loop had no\nimpact on defence (Supplementary Fig. 7g), suggesting that the tip of\nthe harpoon may not be directly involved in trigger detection. Multiple\nefforts to use AlphaFold3 to predict a binding site for the trigger never\nresulted in a high conﬁdence prediction, but most of the models\npositioned the T3 exonuclease near the head of the complex. Ver-\niﬁcation of these models will require further structural studies.\nThe ability of T7 phage to infect cells expressing the FORC 82\nretron is intriguing, given that itsﬂap nuclease is structurally similar\n(RMSD = 0.455 Å across 300 pruned atom pairs) and shares 92% amino\nacid identity with the T3 nuclease. While overexpression of either\nnuclease results in msDNA degradation and toxicity in retron-\nexpressing cells, only T3 phage is neutralized by the immune system,\nsuggesting that T7 may encode an anti-retron gene (Fig.5d). One\ncandidate is the T7 serine/threonine kinase, which was recently shown\nto phosphorylate and inhibit the toxin RcaT in the type II retron-Eco9\n65.\nWhile it is currently unknown whether T7 kinase could inhibit nucleic\nacid targeting components of retron I-A, T7 kinase shares 46% amino\nacid identity with a serine/threonine kinase which showed unique\nmutations in the T3 escaper screen (Fig.4a). Notably, a missense\nmutation in the T3 escaper kinase deletes the predicted DNA-binding\nC-terminal domain, although whether this mutation confers gain-of-\nfunction activity in phosphorylating retron components remains\nunclear. Further investigation is required to determine whether kinase-\nmediated phosphorylation helps T7 evade immunity by retron type I-A.\nRecently, Azam et al. reported that co-expressing the ATPase and\nHNH nuclease from a type I-A retron inE. coli(Ec78) depletes cellular\ntRNA\nTyr\n54, whereas we reveal that the retron fromE. coli FORC 82\nreduces total serine tRNA levels by half. This divergence in tRNA spe-\nciﬁcity suggests that different retron systems have evolved distinct\nsubstrate preferences. This model parallels what we and others\nobserved for the TOPRIM nuclease in the PARIS defence system, where\ndistinct tRNAs are cleaved by TOPRIM nuclease from related PARIS\nsystems\n29,58. However, unlike the Ec78 retron and PARIS, in which\nvirally encoded tRNAs can antagonize immune activity, the tRNASer\nfrom T5 does not appear to evade cleavage by the FORC 82 retron. This\nsuggests that bacteria continually evolve HNH variants to counteract\ntRNA-encoding phages, or that retron-mediated tRNA-cleavage is only\nthe ﬁrst step of a more complex pathway leading to growth arrest.\nTogether, ourﬁndings underscore the paradoxical role of RTs in both\nviral propagation and antiviral defense, highlight the functional plas-\nticity of SMC ATPases across processes like DNA repair and immunity,\nand expand our understanding of how tRNAs—either resistant or sus-\nceptible to HNH cleavage—are shaped by the selective pressures of\ngenetic conﬂict.\nMethod\nStatistics & reproducibility\nPhage challenge assays and bacterial growth assays were performed in\ntwo or three independent biological replicates, as shown in the main\nand Supplementary Fig. panels and detailed in the source dataﬁle.\nReplicate data and uncropped images of gels and plates are provided\nin the source dataﬁle.

While the precise mechanism of infection remains\nunclear, these observations likely reﬂect strain-speciﬁc differences in\nT3 or MG1655.\nCovariance model and sequence comparison for ncRNA\nand tRNA\nRetron type I-A containing genomes15 were downloaded from NCBI\n(n = 70). 1 kb upstream of each RTs was extracted using a custom\nPython script and aligned using MAFFTv7.52068 with the following\nparameters--maxiterate 1000 --localpair. Poorly aligned regions at both\nends of the alignment were trimmed, and a well-aligned ~250 bp region\ncorresponding to the conserved ncRNA element was extracted.

Cells were harvested by cen-\ntrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, then lysed by sonication in\nlysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2, 1 mM DTT).\nT h el y s a t ew a sc l a r iﬁed by centrifuging at 10,000 ×g for 25 min, and\nthe supernatant was passed through a 5 mL StrepTactin column (IBA\nLifescence). After washing with the 20-column volumes of the lysis\nbuffer, bound proteins were eluted using lysis buffer supplemented\nwith 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The retron was further puriﬁed using a\nSuperdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,\n200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol.

The\ntotal dose per exposure was calculated as 56.69 electrons with\n37 subframes per exposure (1.53el/px/frame).\nCryo-EM data processing\nAfter ﬁltering micrographs by CTF-ﬁt <8 Å resolution and total motion\n<100 px, 13,695 exposures were subjected to blob picking in\ncryoSPARC\n74 Live (60–200 Å diameter). 1,576,065 blobs were extrac-\nted using a box size of 512px (binx2) and sorted by 2D classiﬁcation to\nyield a stack of 358,381 selected particles. From these particles, a de\nnovo template volume was generated which contained 245,457 parti-\ncles and reﬁned to 3.7 Å. Using this volume as a template for particle\npicking, 7,373,097 particles were extracted with a box size of 512 px\n(binx4) and subjected to 2D classiﬁcation with a 200 Å mask. 1,321,836\nparticles were selected and fed into a 3-class ab initio reconstruction.\nOne class was identiﬁed containing 1,244,961 particles that appeared\nto correspond to the retron complex but exhibited compositional\nheterogeneity in regions of density corresponding to the HNH. Using a\nsoft-padded mask directed towards the HNH, focused 3D classiﬁcation\nyielded three distinct particle classes that varied based on the orien-\ntation (up or down), or absence of the HNH subunit. Un-binned par-\nticles were then re-extracted with a box size of 480px for non-uniform\nreﬁnement. After reference-based motion correction, we carried out a\nﬁnal round of 2D classiﬁcation to remove remaining junk. Final\nreconstructions were obtained from non-uniform reﬁnements with\nseveral options enabled including minimizing over per particle scale,\ncorrecting for per-particle defocus and estimating the exposure group\nparameters Cs, Anisotropic Magniﬁcation, and tetrafoil.

After rigid bodyﬁtting the individual\nchains using theﬁt in map command in ChimeraX74, each chain was\nequilibrated in ISOLDE76 to improve the initial model. For each density\nmap, the corresponding maps and models were provided to Phenix75\nfor real-space reﬁnement. Per residue CC scores were used to guide the\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63285-6\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8459 9\ntrimming ofﬂexible loops and regions of poor density. Sidechains not\nvisible in the map were removed. Maps were sharpened using Phenix’s\nimplementation of anisotropic half-map sharpening to aid in modeling\ndifﬁcult regions. Additionally, 3DVA volumes were used to inform the\nposition of the ATPase coiled-coil domains\n77. While these features were\nnot included in the mask during theﬁnal iterations of high-resolution\nreﬁnement, they are clearly visible in lower-resolution reﬁnements of\nthe same particle stacks used to generate the maps submitted to EMDB\n(Supplementary Table 1). As such, we opted to include the coiled coil\ndomain in the PDBs, which helps to explain how access to the msDNA is\ngated by ATPase subunits, as well as highlight the role of the coiled coil\nin the tetrameric assembly of ATPases.\nPhage escaper screening and genome sequencing\nPhage escaper assay was performed as described in Avigail et al.18.\nBrieﬂy, E. coliMG1655 cells with or without the retron were grown in LB\nmedia at 37 °C to mid-log phase (OD600 ~0 . 4 )i nt h ep r e s e n c eo f2 5µg/\nmL chloramphenicol and 2 mM CaCl2. In four separate tubes having\n2m Lo fL Ba n d2m MC a C l2, bacterial cultures were added to obtain the\nfollowing percentages of defence-containing cells: 0%, 1%, 10%, or\n100%. Cultures were inoculated with 20µLo fT 3o rT 5p h a g es t o c ka n d\nincubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The tubes were centrifuged\nat 5000 × g for 10 min, and 20µLo ft h ec l a r iﬁed supernatants were\ntransferred into fresh cultures prepared under the same conditions.\nThis passaging step was repeated for four consecutive rounds.\nSupernatants from the fourth passage wereﬁlter-sterilized (0.22µm),\nserially diluted, and plated for plaque assays on defence-containing\ncells. Phage preparations that formed plaques were re-tested, and\nthree individual plaques were picked for T3. No escapers could be\nisolated for T5. Each T3 plaque was used to inoculate 2 mL of mid-log\ndefence-containing cultures (25µg/mL chloramphenicol), which were\ngrown overnight at 37 °C with shaking and then centrifuged at\n5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants wereﬁlter-\nsterilized (0.22µm) and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Pel-\nlets were gently resuspended in 300µL of SM buffer, andﬁnal phage\nstocks were stored at 4 °C.\nPhage genomic DNA was extracted following previously descri-\nbed protocols\n78. Isolated phage stocks were incubated with DNase I\nand RNase A for 1 h to eliminate contaminatingE. coli DNA. The\nnucleases were then inactivated by adding EDTA and heating at 65 °C.\nPhage capsids were digested with proteinase K in the presence of SDS,\nand the resulting phage genomic DNA was puri ﬁed by\nphenol–chloroform extraction. The puriﬁed DNA was sequenced using\nthe Native Barcoding Kit V14 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) on a\nGridION sequencer.

Individual colonies\nwere grown overnight in the presence of 2% glucose and antibiotics\nand 10-fold serial dilution of the liquid culture was spotted in LB agar\nplates containing either 2% glucose or 0.2 mM IPTG in the presence of\nantibiotics. The plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and imaged.\nmsDNA cleavage analysis\nChemically competentE. coli cells containing the WT retron were\ntransformed with WT or mutant T3 exonuclease and cultured over-\nnight in LB media supplemented with 2% glucose and antibiotics\n(chloramphenicol and streptomycin). The overnight cultures were\nthen used to inoculate a secondary culture and grown to OD\n600 of ~0.4\nin the presence of antibiotics. IPTG was added to induce expression of\nthe exonuclease. DNA was extracted using the Zymo ZR Plasmid\nMiniprep kit and DNA shorter than 500 bps were resolved by 15%\nurea-PAGE.\nFluorescence microscopy\nBacterial cells carrying either WT or HNH-inactive retron in the\npACYCDuet-1 backbone were transformed with T3 exonuclease and\ngrown in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics\n(chloramphenicol and streptomycin) at 37 °C until reaching an OD\n600\nof 0.5–0.6. Cultures were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C\nwith shaking. Following induction, cells were harvested by cen-\ntrifugation and washed with 1× PBS. Cells were simultaneously incu-\nbated with 5µg/mL Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Oregon Green\n(Invitrogen, W7024) and 10µg/mL propidium iodide for 15 min at RT\nfollowed by two washes with 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated with\n50 µg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes in the\ndark at room temperature. After staining, cells were transferred to\nPoly-L-lysine-treated coverslips and allowed to adhere for 5 min before\nimaging. Imaging was performed using an inverted spinning-disc\nconfocal microscope built by 3i. The system included a Zeis 63×1.4 NA\nPlan-Apochromat objective, Yokogawa CSU-W1 SORA confocal head,\n2.8× magniﬁcation changer, 100 mW lasers (40% power: 405 nm,\n488 nm, 561 nm), and a Hamamatsu Orca-Fusion BT camera (2x bin-\nning to create 74 nm pixels). A piezo stage was used to acquire 10 z\nplanes/sample with a step size of 0.27µm. Acquired images were\nanalyzed using Fiji\n80. For presentation, only one z plane was used.\ntRNA sequencing and analysis\nChemically competentE. colicells containing either the WT retron or\nthe HNH-inactive (H71A) retron were transformed with T3 exonuclease\nand grown overnight in the presence of 2% glucose and antibiotics\n(chloramphenicol and streptomycin). Secondary cultures were inocu-\nlated from the overnight cultures, grown to an OD\n600 of 0.4–0.5 in the\npresence of antibiotics, and induced with IPTG for 15 min. Total RNA,\nincluding small RNAs, was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA\nMiniprep Kit.\ntRNA sequencing (MSR-seq) was performed by MesoRNA (Chi-\ncago, IL, USA) as per previously reported protocol\n81.T o t a lR N A( 1µg)\nwas subjected to deacylation by oxidation with sodium periodate\n(NaIO\n4), followed by quenching with ribose and treatment with sodium\ntetraborate for β-elimination. The deacylated RNA was then end-\nrepaired using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK; New England Biolabs,\nNEB) and ligated to biotinylated capture hairpin oligos (CHO) con-\ntaining sample-speciﬁc barcodes using T4 RNA Ligase I (NEB). After\nligation, all barcoded samples were pooled. The pooled samples were\ncaptured on streptavidin-coated MyOne C1 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher\nScientiﬁc) via the biotinylated CHOs. Following capture, the samples\nwere dephosphorylated with Quick CIP (Roche) and reverse-\ntranscribed overnight using SuperScript IV Master Mix (Thermo\nFisher Scientiﬁc). RNA templates were subsequently degraded with\nRNase H (NEB), and cDNA subjected to periodate oxidation. After\nquenching periodate with ribose, the single-stranded cDNAs were\nligated to the second ligation oligo and then released from the beads\nby incubating at 95 °C. For each sample, 100 ng of puriﬁed cDNA was\nPCR-ampliﬁed for 12 cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, 20 s at 72 °C).\nThe ampliﬁed products were puriﬁed using the DNA Clean & Con-\ncentrator kit (Zymo Research) and resolved on a 10% non-denaturing\nTBE polyacrylamide gel with appropriate dsDNA size markers. Bands\ncorresponding to theﬁnal library size were gel-extracted and ethanol-\nprecipitated. The resulting libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq X\nPlus platform using a 1.5Bﬂow cell (Illumina). Raw reads were demul-\ntiplexed and processed by MesoRNA to generate tRNA count tables.\nReads were demultiplexed and trimmed in accordance with the MSR-\nseq library preparation protocol\n81. Quality control was performed with\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63285-6\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8459 10\nFastQC82. Reads were aligned to tRNA sequences in GtRNAdb83 using\nbowtie284 to generate tRNA count tables.\ntRNA sequencing counts were normalized and subjected to dif-\nferential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package85 in R with\ncustom scripts. Fold changes in tRNA abundance were calculated by\nDESeq2, which employs a negative binomial distribution model to\nestimate dispersion and determine statistical signiﬁcance (p-value).\nNorthern blot analysis\nChemically competentE. colicells containing either the WT retron or\nthe HNH-inactive (H71A) retron, with or without T5 tRNASer-GCT, were\ntransformed with T3 nuclease and grown overnight in LB medium\nsupplemented with 2% glucose and appropriate antibiotics (chlor-\namphenicol, streptomycin, and kanamycin). Secondary cultures were\ninoculated from the overnight cultures, grown to an OD\n600 of 0.4–0.5\nin the presence of antibiotics, and T3 exonuclease expression was\ninduced with IPTG for 60 minutes. Total RNA, including small RNAs,\nwas extracted using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit according to\nthe manufacturer’si n s t r u c t i o n sa n ds a m p l e sw e r er e s o l v e do na1 0 %\ndenaturing urea-PAGE gel run at 180 V for 90 minutes. Following\nelectrophoresis, the gel was washed with 1× TBE buffer for 5 minutes\nand transferred to an Amersham Hybond-N nylon membrane at 30 V\nfor 2 hours. The membrane was then UV-crosslinked using a tran-\nsilluminator at maximum power for 5 minutes. For hybridization, the\nmembrane was pre-washed with 30 mL of pre-hybridization buffer (6×\nSSC containing 0.5% SDS) for 10 minutes, then incubated overnight at\n45 °C with 20 nM northern probes speciﬁc for 5S rRNA (FAM-labeled),\nE. coli tRNA\nSer-GCT (ID700-labeled), and T5 tRNASer-GCT (ID800-\nlabeled) in 30 mL of pre-hybridization buffer (Supplementary Data 3).\nAfter hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with wash buffer\n(2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 minutes each and imaged using an Amersham\nTyphoon Scanner.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe sequencing data for T3 and T5 strains used in this study have been\ndeposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information\n(NCBI) Sequence Read Archive under BioProject IDPRJNA1222438.\nThis BioProject also contains the tRNA sequencing data and whole-\ngenome sequencing data for the T3 phage escaper mutants.

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase \n(RT), a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, \nand a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase (RT), noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA \ncomplex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which \npoint the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single- \nstranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates \nfor genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current rep-\nertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced \nfrom clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology \nand natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome \neditors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a \nvariety of environmental samples. Here, we identify seven new retron systems, each \nisolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize DNA production by these \nretrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of Escherichia coli phages. We \nfind that two of these retrons are disrupted by other elements, in one case a group \nII intron and in another a separate defense system, yet both retrons still produce \nRT-DNA. For two other retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by \nidentifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we \nengineer these retrons for genome editing in E. coli, demonstrating their potential use \nin a biotechnological application.", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "41129495:0", "pdf_file": "/Users/viku/Documents/UIUC/work/PETase/data/retron/41129495.pdf", "title": "PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003042 October 23, 2025 1 / 19"}}

The components of these systems include a reverse transcrip-\ntase (RT), a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) that is partially reverse transcribed to a hybrid \nRNA/DNA molecule, and one or more effector proteins that typically function as tox-\nins to the retron host [1–3]. The toxicity of the effector protein(s) is neutralized in the \npresence of the RT and reverse-transcribed DNA (RT-DNA), but perturbation of the \nRT-DNA by phage-encoded elements can release this neutralization, leading to abor-\ntive infection. Beyond their natural function in phage defense, retrons have also been \nrepurposed into components of biotechnology [4–6]. For instance, retron ncRNA can \nbe modified so that reverse transcription produces template DNA for genome editing \n[7–18].\nRetrons were initially discovered in Myxobacteria when researchers noticed \nunexplained bands running on acrylamide gels of ~120 nucleotides in length from \ntotal nucleic acid preparations [19]. Subsequent studies determined that these bands \nwere single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), produced by a retron RT from a retron ncRNA \n[20]. More recently, thousands of retrons have been bioinformatically predicted in \ndiverse bacterial species and categorized into clades and types [21]. These retrons \nhave different effector proteins and mechanisms, as well as widely varying RT-DNA \nproduction and utility in gene editing [22].\nDespite this, only a handful of retrons have been studied in the context of their \nnatural host, and retron defense against phages has only been studied in Escherichia \ncoli [3,23–25], Bacillus subtilis [26], and Salmonella enterica [1]. Identifying a wider \nrange of natural hosts would enable researchers to determine whether mechanisms \nidentified biochemically or within model systems like E. coli accurately represent their \nbiology. Furthermore, prior studies have been largely limited to retrons from clinical \nand laboratory strains of bacteria with few environmental examples (e.g., Vibrio mim-\nicus [27]). Given the limited selection of experimentally confirmed retrons, charac-\nterization of additional retrons sourced from different environments could lead to the \ndiscovery of new defense mechanisms and the development of better biotechnology \nfor application in molecular genetics.\nIn this study, we develop an approach to identify novel retrons in bacteria \nisolated from soil and water samples by screening for RT-DNA bands using DNA \nisolation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Here, we add seven new envi -\nronmental retron hosts. We demonstrate that six of the seven naturally sourced \nretrons can be ported into E. coli to produce RT-DNA and two exhibit defense \nagainst E. coli phages. By sequencing phage escapees, we determine that the \nBas51 N6 adenine methyltransferase is a trigger for these two retrons and extend \nthe mechanism to show that this trigger activates growth suppression in the nat -\nural host of one retron. We also demonstrate that these environmentally sourced \nretrons can be used for genome editing in E. coli. This process for isolating and \nidentifying novel retrons can be used to expand our understanding of retron biol -\nogy by providing more natural hosts for study and aid in the development of new \ntools for genome editing.\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the \noriginal author and source are credited.\nData availability statement: Sequencing data \nassociated with this study are available in the \nNCBI SRA (PRJNA1196507) https://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1196507.\nFunding: Work was supported by awards and \nfunding to S.L.S from the National Science \nFoundation (MCB 2509382, https://www.nsf.\ngov/bio/mcb), the Robert J Kleberg, Jr. and \nHelen C.

Two samples, later identified as Serratia quini-\nvorans and Huaxiibacter chinensis, were cultured at 30 °C in subsequent experiments after exhibiting faster growth at this \ntemperature.\nWe identified retron-bearing hosts by the presence of the characteristic retron ssDNA that runs at 40–180 nucleotides \non a polyacrylamide gel. To do so, we prepped total DNA from the 7 h cultures using Qiagen miniprep kits and ran this \nDNA on TBE-Urea gels (Fig 1b). In total, 13 water samples and 19 soil samples were collected. DNA was isolated from \n198 subcultures. Twenty-nine of the subcultures exhibited possible bands on initial gels. Seven subcultures were not \nfollowed up because they duplicated band positions from other bacteria originating from the same environmental sample. \nThe remaining 22 subcultures with possible bands were recultured and rechecked. Eight of these subcultures could not be \nrecovered from glycerol stocks and six subcultures showed no distinct bands upon rechecking, leaving eight subcultures \nwith reliable RT-DNA production. We sequenced the genomes of the remaining eight subcultures, which revealed seven \nputative retron operons with one duplicate strain (Fig 1c and S3 Table).\nBacterial subcultures showing a putative retron RT-DNA band underwent both whole genome sequencing, as well \nas ssDNA isolation followed by RT-DNA sequencing ( Fig 1d and 1e). Whole genome data was analyzed using the \nProkaryotic Antiviral Defense Locator (PADLOC) [ 28] tool, which identifies retron operons and the genes encoding \nthe effector protein, ncRNA, and RT, which are present in most retron types ( Fig 1f). We also analyzed whole genome \ncontigs using PubMLST, which identified the species of each bacterial host based on genes encoding ribosome pro -\ntein subunits. In total, PADLOC predicted novel retron operons in the genomes of five of the seven potential hosts, \nwith a lone retron RT also identified in Sphingobacterium daejeonense . Another lone retron RT was found in Bacillus \nthuringiensis  by manually checking motifs identified in the HMMERS section of the DefenseFinder [ 29] tool and by \nsearching broadly for RTs using MyRT [ 30]. Retrons have been classified into 13 types based on effector function and \noperon structure [ 21]. Five of the natural operons identified here could be categorized into known retron types: II-A for \nS. quinivorans  (Retron-Squ1), Aeromonas salmonicida  (Retron-Asa1), and H. chinensis  (Retron-Hch1); and III-A for \nBacillus pumilus  (Retron-Bpu1) and Pseudomonas peli  (Retron-Ppe1) ( Fig 1g–1k). The remaining two putative retrons \ndid not fall into a previously characterized type. The putative retron in Sphingobacterium daejeonense  (Retron-Sda1) \ncontained a III-A1-like RT, but without the PRTase/WH effector genes that are typical of III-A1 ( Fig 1l). The putative \nretron in Bacillus thuringiensis  (Retron-Bth1), which was mapped to an extrachromosomal element rather than the \nbacterial genome, had no obvious effector, and contained a group II intron, a self-splicing mobile genetic element, \nwithin the coding sequence of the putative retron RT ( Fig 1m). Ignoring the group II intron, the Retron-Bth1 RT is \nunclassified among other retron RTs. For each retron operon, we identified a characteristic retron ncRNA based on \nsecondary structure. In four cases, we were able to sequence the retron RT-DNA and plot coverage onto the ncRNA \n(coverage in orange).\nNaturally sourced retrons can produce RT-DNA in E. coli\nTo validate that the retron systems we identified were complete, we amplified them from the genomes of their natural \nhosts, cloned them onto plasmids, and transformed them for expression in E. coli bSLS114 (a derivative of BL21-AI with \nendogenous Retron-Eco1 removed [4]) downstream of an inducible T7/lac promoter (Fig 2a). In cloning retron operons, \nwe included 100–150 bases before the start codon of the first gene to capture the native promoter.\nWe analyzed RT-DNA production in both uninduced and induced conditions, to see if the systems were competent \nfor production and if the systems carried their own constitutive promoters that are active in E. coli . Similar to analysis \nfrom within the natural host, cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB media overnight, then passaged at a 1:100 dilution \nand grown for an additional 7 h the following day with a previously characterized retron, Retron-Eco1, run in parallel \nas a control for RT-DNA production. DNA was isolated using a Qiagen miniprep then analyzed on a TBE-Urea gel \n(Fig 2b).", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "41129495:3", "pdf_file": "/Users/viku/Documents/UIUC/work/PETase/data/retron/41129495.pdf", "title": "PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003042 October 23, 2025 1 / 19"}}

We presume that this retron is constitutively expressed \nand toxic to E. coli, perhaps due to the presence of a trigger for this retron in E. coli, or the absence of a neutralizing factor \nfrom the natural host.\nEvery other retron produced RT-DNA in E. coli when overexpressed from the T7 promoter (with induction). Retrons- \nAsa1, Squ1, and Bpu1 additionally produced detectable RT-DNA without induction suggesting that their endogenous \npromoters are sufficient for constitutive expression in E. coli. This data confirms that the components in each putative \nretron operon are sufficient for RT-DNA production. RT-DNA length exactly matches the length initially observed for all ret-\nrons other than Retron-Bth1, further indicating that these operons contain the elements responsible for the RT-DNA in the \nnatural hosts. The RT-DNA produced by the Retron-Bth1 operon in E. coli is longer than the band observed in the natural \nhost. While this could indicate that a different element is responsible for RT-DNA production in the natural host, we found \nno other candidate. Thus, we speculate that the longer RT-DNA is likely due to a difference in termination or degradation \nof the RT-DNA in the host versus E. coli.\nRetrons exhibit phage defense\nTo better understand how naturally sourced retrons function as defense systems, we next tested the four retrons with \nintact, type-identified operons for defense against a diverse panel of 12 E. coli phages, including examples of Drexler-\nviridae (Bas01), Siphoviridae (Bas15, Bas20, Bas21), Demerecviridae (T5), Myoviridae (Bas37, T4, P1), Mosigvirus \n(Bas46), Vequintavirinae (Bas51), Autographiviridae (T7), and Siphoviridae (lambda) [31]. The more complex cases of \nretrons-Sda1 and -Bth1 are experimentally addressed in the next section. For this test, cultures of E. coli MG1655 were \ntransformed with Retrons-Asa1, -Squ1, -Hch1, and -Bpu1 (same plasmids as Fig 2), first using the endogenous promoters \nto drive retron expression. Transformed strains were plated in LB agar. Phages were then titrated and spotted, and plates \nwere left at 37 °C overnight for plaques to form.\nWe found that Retron-Asa1 exhibited defense against four phages: Bas01, Bas20, Bas21, and Bas51 (Fig 3a) and \nRetron- Squ1 exhibited defense against six phages: Bas01, Bas15, Bas20, Bas21, Bas51, and T5 (Fig 3b). Retrons-Hch1 \nand -Bpu1 exhibited no defense phenotype against any of the phages tested. One potential explanation for a lack of \nphage defense from retrons-Hch1 and -Bpu1 could be weak expression from their endogenous promoters in E. coli. \nIndeed, the two retrons that did defend produced more RT-DNA in uninduced conditions than the two retrons that did \nnot show a defense phenotype (Fig 2b). To check, we tested for phage defense against the same panel of phages with \nretrons- Hch1 and -Bpu1 overexpressed from a T7 promoter in strain bSLS114, but we still found no defense phenotypes \nfor these retrons against this phage panel (S1 Fig).\nFig 2.

Cells transformed with \nretrons as above were plated and Bas51 was spotted at low concentrations, allowing phages with mutations in genes \ntriggering the retron to escape retron defense and form plaques.\nWe used nanopore sequencing to identify potential trigger genes in mutant phage escapees, sequencing four escapees \nof Retron-Asa1 and four of Retron-Squ1. When analyzing data, we ignored mutations in homopolymeric regions (known to \nbe enriched for nanopore errors [32]) and synonymous mutations. All escapees that we sequenced contained mutations \nin an adenine methyltransferase gene, with five distinct mutations across the eight escapee phages (Fig 4a). Additionally, \nfour of eight contained an identical premature stop mutation in a glycosidase gene (Fig 4b).\nTo determine whether either the methyltransferase or glycosidase gene functioned as a trigger, we initially tried express-\ning the genes individually in the presence or absence of the retrons to see if either resulted in a growth defect in the pres-\nence of the retron. However, we found that the methyltransferase was toxic to cells even in the absence of the retron.\nFig 3.

{"text": "PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003042 October 23, 2025 8 / 19\nTo avoid the issue of methyltransferase toxicity, we instead introduced mutations in the methyltransferase and glyco-\nsidase genes in Bas51. By making these mutations precisely on a wild-type phage background, we could disentangle \npotential effects of the methyltransferase and glycosidase (which were often both mutated in escapees) and remove the \nconfounding influence of other mutations that were present in escapees. In separate phages, we precisely introduced \nthree of the escapee mutations in the N6 adenine methyltransferase (D69G, D79G, and T83P) and the premature stop \nmutation in the glycosidase using a recombitron approach [33].\nMutating the methyltransferase gene at any of three tested positions eliminated defense by both Retron-Asa1 and \n-Squ1, resulting in the same level of plaque formation as a control case expressing no retron (Fig 4c and 4d). This indi-\ncates that the Bas51 N6 adenine methyltransferase gene triggers both retrons. Introducing a premature stop mutation in \nthe glycosidase gene also inhibited the phage defense phenotype of Retron-Asa1, but not Retron-Squ1 (Fig 4c and 4d).\nWe decided to further investigate the mechanism of methyltransferase-based triggering by first identifying the asso-\nciated methylation site motif. We reasoned that a phage-encoded methyltransferase likely acts on the phage genome, \nthus we performed native sequencing of the Bas51 genome on the nanopore using a base calling algorithm that iden-\ntifies N6-methylated adenines. Sequence alignment of all sites containing these methylated adenines reveals a distinct \nGATC motif (Fig 4e). The association of this motif with this specific methyltransferase was validated upon sequencing a \nBas51 phage containing a T83P mutation in the gene, which resulted in near complete depletion of methylated adenines \nat GATC sites (Figs 4f and S4). This experiment additionally confirms that this mutation, which was first identified in a \nphage escapee, confers loss-of-function to the methyltransferase. Importantly, the GATC motif is present on both the \n Retron-Asa1 and -Squ1 ncRNAs and is confirmed to be reverse transcribed for Retron-Asa1 (Fig 4g and 4h).\nAfter establishing that these retrons are triggered by a methyltransferase in E. coli, we wondered whether they exhibit \nthe same behavior in their native hosts. For this, we chose to examine Retron-Squ1 in S. quinivorans due to the genetic \ntractability of the host strain. We expressed the methyltransferase in both wild-type S. quinivorans (which contains a \ngenomic copy of Retron-Squ1) and S. quinivorans with Retron-Squ1 deleted (ΔSqu1), then measured growth of the cul-\ntures over eight hours. The wild-type strain showed reduced growth when the methyltransferase was expressed as com-\npared to an empty vector control, and this growth effect was eliminated by deleting the endogenous Retron-Squ1 (ΔSqu1), \ndemonstrating that this methyltransferase is able to trigger a toxic effect via the retron in its natural host (Fig 4i). Further-\nmore, when Retron-Squ1 borne on a high-copy plasmid was co-expressed with the methyltransferase in the ΔSqu1 strain, \ngrowth was reduced to an even greater level compared to when either plasmid was replaced with an empty vector control \n(Fig 4j). These results demonstrate Retron-Squ1 triggering dynamics in the context of its native host.\nRetrons-Sda1 and -Bth1 are disrupted by intervening genes\nUnlike the retrons characterized above, Retrons-Sda1 and -Bth1 could not be easily categorized into existing retron \ntypes. In the case of Retron-Sda1, the identified ncRNA was classified as a type III-A1 ncRNA. However, instead of being \nco-located with the PRTase and DNA-binding domain-containing proteins that characterize retrons type III, Retron-Sda1 \nwas co-located with two genes encoding proteins for HipA-like kinase and DUF3037 domains, respectively (Fig 1l). Given \nthe lack of the usual Type III effectors, we decided to investigate this case in more depth. For this, we queried the NCBI nr \nmultiple comparisons, wt:empty vs. wt:methyltransferase P = 0.0045; wt:methyltransferase vs. ΔSqu1:methyltransferase P = 0.0021, all other conditions \nns).

Interestingly, DUF3037 was found to be strongly associated with HipA-like containing proteins \n(S1 File). This two-gene system was identified by PADLOC as a phage defense candidate (PDC) M66 (Fig 5a) across \nnumerous homologs of the tree. A similar domain architecture was also found recently in the experimentally validated \nsystem DS-6 [34]. In the RT tree, the association of the RT with HipA/DUF3037 occurred at least in six different cases (Fig \n5b and 5c and S2 File) in two different clades (Fig 5b). One occurrence is found in species from the Bacteroidota phy-\nlum, and the other one is in species from the Pseudomonadota phylum (Fig 5b and 5c). Furthermore, we found that the \n C-terminal region of the DUF3037 shares sequence similarity to the DNA-binding protein from close Type III-A1 retrons \n(Fig 5d), likely representing a recent evolutionary event where the PRTase effector has been replaced by a predicted func-\ntional system (PDC-M66) formed by HipA and DUF3037. Although not very abundant, this case could represent a nascent \nassociation or even a retron that has captured new effectors, in an scenario similar to what occurred in Retron types II-A1 \nand I-A, where the NDT effector was replaced by a Septu defense system [21].\nWe found that the operon containing Retron-Sda1 exhibits defense against phage Bas51 when induced in bSLS114, \nwhich gave us the opportunity to test dependence on each component of the operon. Defense was unaffected by dele-\ntions of the HTH or ncRNA, or by introduction of mutations that inactivate the RT (dRT) (Fig 5e). However, deletion of the \nHipA kinase eliminated all defense. Furthermore, deletion of the DUF3037 gene caused cell toxicity. Combined, these \nresults support a role for the HipA kinase and DUF3037 gene as a standalone defense system, where the HipA kinase \nfunctions as a toxin that is neutralized by the DUF3037 protein. This system does not require the retron RT or ncRNA for \ndefense against Bas51.\nWe also explored the case of Retron-Bth1, which lacks an apparent effector gene and contains two RT genes. Unlike \nall other retrons isolated in this study which exist in the bacterial genome, we found Retron-Bth1 on an extrachromosomal \nassembly of 234kb that could potentially be a plasmid or phage. One RT gene in this operon belongs to a group II intron which \nappears to have inserted into the Retron-Bth1 RT gene. This retron was observed to produce RT-DNA in Fig 2b, so we hypoth-\nesized that the group II intron may splice out of the retron RT in frame, allowing for translation of functional protein to occur. To \nconfirm that RT-DNA was produced by the retron RT alone, and not the group II intron RT, we cloned Retron-Bth1 in bSLS114 \nwith the group II intron deleted (Fig 5f). This visibly increased RT-DNA production, demonstrating that the observed band \nderives from the retron RT. The clear difference in band intensity between the wild-type operon and the operon with the group II \nintron deleted demonstrates that group II intron splicing is inefficient in E. coli and can inhibit proper translation of the RT.\nPrecise editing using recombitrons based on naturally sourced retrons\nThe recombitron approach that we used to edit Bas51 and identify its methyltransferase as the trigger was enabled \nby repurposing retron components into biotechnology for genome editing. In recombitrons, a modified retron ncRNA is \nreverse transcribed by the retron RT to produce RT-DNA that serves as a recombineering donor, where the RT-DNA is \nincorporated into the lagging strand during DNA replication, precisely changing the genome in the process [7–9,15,35]. \nThis approach increases editing efficiencies compared to producing template DNA in vitro then delivering it to a cell and is \nparticularly useful when editing phage genomes because the recombineering donor is produced in high abundance within \nthe host [33]. We have found that this technology can be built on different retrons, but that some retrons support more \nefficient editing than others [22]. To determine whether naturally sourced retrons could be used to design efficient editors, \nwe engineered them to produce templates for recombineering of the lacZ gene in E. coli (Fig 6a).\nNaturally sourced retron RT-DNAs were modified to encode a template for a 10 bp deletion in the lacZ gene. For retrons \nwithout RT-DNA data, the RT-DNA was assumed to cover the longest stem-loop in the ncRNA secondary structure. Ret-\nrons were expressed on a plasmid also containing a gene for CspRecT, a ssDNA annealing protein that enables efficient \nrecombineering from the reverse transcribed donor.

Editing \ndata was quantified by Illumina sequencing.\nThe Retron-Eco1 editor, which uses a well-studied retron from E. coli as a scaffold, exhibited higher editing rates than \neditors using naturally sourced retrons (Fig 6b). Among editors based on naturally sourced retrons, the Retron-Asa1 editor \nwas the most efficient and made deletions in ~30% of cells by the second culture round (Fig 6c). The remaining four retron \neditors exhibited much lower editing rates (below 2% after one day) (Fig 6d–6g). Interestingly, Retron-Asa1, which dis-\nplayed the highest editing rate, also consistently produced more abundant RT-DNA when compared to retrons with lower \nediting rates (S3 Fig).\nDiscussion\nThough many retrons have been studied in E. coli, few have been identified from environmental samples or studied in \ntheir native bacterial hosts. This study describes a new approach to isolate retrons and their native hosts from environ-\nmental soil and water samples by screening for RT-DNA bands on polyacrylamide gels. This approach expands the col-\nlection of known retron hosts and could enable studies of retrons that cannot be transformed into E. coli or who function \ndifferently outside of their natural host bacterium.\nFor purely practical reasons, we chose to grow bacteria mainly at 37 °C in LB media in this study. These culture \nconditions undoubtedly select for faster-growing organisms and differ from the natural environments from where we \nsourced these bacteria. Indeed, the overrepresentation of type II-A and III-A retrons may reflect selection due to culturing \nconditions favoring bacteria harboring these types. Future work that tests a wider variety of culture conditions, including \nthose that mimic natural environments, may find additional interesting retron-bearing bacteria and we hope that this work \nprovides a roadmap for isolation of many new retron hosts from the wild. We additionally used the natural codons for all \ntesting, including for expression in E. coli. We found RT-DNA production for six of the seven systems, with the last system \nbeing toxic to cells, indicating that proteins are being produced in all cases. However, it is possible that optimizing codon \nusage could have increased the potency of some systems, which we did not test.\nFig 6.

However, the case of Retron-Bth1 illustrates a more unique example where \nthe physical identification of RT-DNA led us to describe a piece of biology that would have likely been overlooked in \nmetagenomics. First, it is found on an extrachromosomal element and the fact that we had the strain let us link this ele-\nment to the species. Second, because the RT gene is disrupted by the insertion of a group II intron and is not associated \nwith a canonical effector, it is not readily identified as a retron by annotation tools. We would likely have not identified this \nodd, disrupted, but still DNA-producing retron, if we had not found the RT-DNA in its natural host and gone searching \ndeeply for RTs in the genome.\nInterestingly, Retron-Sda1 contains a type III retron RT gene but without its typical PRTase (phosphoribosyltransferase- \nlike) effector. Instead, this effector appears to have been replaced with a different phage defense system composed of a \nHipA-like kinase domain and DUF3037 domain that function on their own [34]. Although the RT-DNA and RT gene are not \ninvolved in defense against the phage we tested, this new association could represent an early stage in the evolution of a \nnew retron type, given the wide-ranging association of retron systems with different effector types [21].\nWe also show that the N6 adenine methyltransferase in Bas51 acts as a trigger for Retron-Squ1, while both the N6 \nadenine methyltransferase and glycosidase contribute to triggering Retron-Asa1. This suggests that these naturally \nsourced retrons are triggered by methylation of the RT-DNA, as has been shown for other retrons [1], whereas the gly-\ncosidase perturbs the retron effector-bound complex via an unknown mechanism. We provide additional evidence for \ntriggering by the methyltransferase gene through identification of methylation site motifs on the ncRNA of both retrons, \nwhere it is found specifically in the reverse transcribed region for Retron-Asa1. For Retron-Squ1, we confirm that methyl-\ntransferase activity also triggers the retron in its native host, S. quinivorans, and that the degree of retron-induced toxicity \nincreases with retron copy number.\nWhile most naturally sourced retrons isolated in this study are not efficient editors in E. coli, the Asa1 recombitron \nexhibits gene editing potential. Further research could explore the gene editing capabilities of recombitrons in other cell \ntypes or conditions more similar to their native host bacteria and environment.\nMethods\nIsolating bacteria from soil and water samples\nSmall samples of soil (~2.5 g) and water (~10 mL) were collected from glacial lakes and streams as well as alpine moun-\ntains, woodlands, and parks. Microbes were isolated from soil samples using the Zymo fecal/soil microbe kit, which \nremoved dirt and rocks. Water and soil processed with the Zymo kit were then plated on plain LB and allowed to grow \novernight or until colonies formed at 37 °C.\nIdentifying RT-DNA bands on polyacrylamide gel\nColonies were picked, sampling from those with visibly different appearances, and cultured in 3 or 5 mL of LB overnight, \nshaking at 37 °C.

PADLOC also \nidentifies the likely start and end of accessory and RT genes.\nIn samples where whole-genome data was not collected or where assembled contigs did not contain the entire retron \noperon, genomic DNA was tagmented using Tn5 preloaded with Illumina sequencing adapters and amplified to enrich for \nretron-containing fragments. To perform this PCR, two primers were designed to bind the known RT-DNA sequence facing \nopposite directions to capture both ends of the retron. Another two primers were designed to bind the two Illumina adapt-\ners at each end of the fragment. Four PCR reactions were then performed, one for every combination of RT-DNA-binding \nprimer and adapter-binding primer. The enriched sample was then sequenced using either MiSeq or Sanger sequencing \nof the resulting amplicons. When necessary, this process was repeated to capture the entire retron operon with primers \nmoving successively outward from the known part of the retron.\nIdentifying new retron types in sequencing data\nIn samples with potential RT-DNA, but where PADLOC did not identify full retron systems, potential retron RT genes were \nidentified using the PADLOC, DefenseFinder, and NCBI’s BLAST programs to find sequences with similarity to known \nretron RTs. Possible retron accessory genes were identified by studying both their direction and gene functions predicted \nby BLAST and EMBL-EBI’s Interpro tool.\nFinding homologs of Retron-Sda1\nTo investigate the unusual genomic context of Retron-Sda1, we conducted a comprehensive homology and phylogenetic \nanalysis. Initially, protein sequences corresponding to the RT and DUF3037 domains of Retron-Sda1 were extracted from \nthe assembled genome contigs. These sequences were used as queries in a BLASTp search against the NCBI non- \nredundant (nr) protein database [https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz] to identify homologous proteins across \ndiverse bacterial taxa. Multiple sequence alignments of the retrieved RT and DUF3037 protein sequences were performed \nusing MAFFT v7.475 with the G-INS-i algorithm [36]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using FastTree v2.1 [37] with \ndefault parameters. To examine the genomic context of the identified homologs, we utilized the NCBI Entrez Programming \nUtilities [38] API to retrieve genomic neighborhoods surrounding each homologous RT and DUF3037 gene.

Defense system annotation was carried out using PADLOC v2.0.0 \n[27], This analysis was facilitated by custom Python scripts utilizing the Biopython library [39]. Genomic neighorhoods \nwere visualized using a custom JavaScript code and made availale as a portable HTML file.\nCloning retron plasmids and verifying RT-DNA production in E. coli\nPredicted retron operons were amplified by PCR from their host bacterial genomes and cloned into a pET-21(+) backbone \n(ColE1 ori, kanamycin resistance) in NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli. Plasmids were verified with Sanger sequencing and \nthen transformed into BL21ΔEco1 (bSLS.114 [7], Addgene #191530).\nColonies were picked into 3 mL of LB, grown overnight (shaking at 37 °C), passaged at a 1:100 dilution into 3 mL of LB, \nand then induced with working concentrations of 1 mM IPTG (GoldBio) and 2 mg/ml L-arabinose (GoldBio). After 7 h of cul-\nture with induction, DNA was miniprepped using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit and RT-DNA bands were visualized using \nelectrophoresis on 15% TBE-urea gels (Thermo Fisher EC6885).\nPhage strains and propagation\nLambda and T5 phages were initially propagated from ATCC stocks (Lambda WT #23724-B2, T5 #11303-B5). T4 phage \nwas drawn from a previously established stock [33]. MG1,655 E. coli culture was infected with phage and grown over-\nnight. The culture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 3,434g and the supernatant was filtered at 0.2 μm to remove bacterial \nremnants. Lysate titer was determined using the full plate plaque assay method as described by Kropinski and colleagues \n[40]. We used a strictly lytic version of lambda carrying two early stop codons in the cI gene, responsible for lysogeny \ncontrol, to ensure the phage was strictly lytic (lambda ΔcI) [33]. This lambda strain additionally contains a genomic dele-\ntion between positions 21,738 and 27,723 that includes genes involved in lysogeny control. Lambda ΔcI was used for all \nphage defense experiments. Bas51 phage was propagated from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ stock (https://www.dsmz.de/\ncollection/catalogue/details/culture/DSM-112929), and was originally isolated in the BASEL phage collection [31].\nTesting retron defense against E. coli phages\nMG1,655 cells were transformed with plasmids containing the retron operons and plated. Transformed colonies were \npicked and cultured overnight in 3 mL of LB (shaking at 37 °C) then passaged in 3 mL of MMB (LB medium supplemented \nwith 0.1 mM MnCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2) for 3−5 h. 200 µL of culture was plated in 3 mL of MMB soft agar in each well of a \n4-well MMB agar plate. Lambda, T4, T5, and Bas51 phages were serially diluted to 10−4, 10−5, 10−6, and 10−7 in MMB \nmedia. 5 µL of each dilution was spotted on these plates. After the spots have completely dried, plates were incubated \nat 37 °C overnight. Resultant plaques were counted to determine the titer (pfu/mL) of each phage strain on each retron- \nexpressing bacterial lawn.\nIsolating mutant phages and identifying retron trigger genes\nFor retron and phage combinations where defense occurred, phages and retrons were plated on MMB soft agar at the \nlowest phage dilution where few or no plaques were visible. Plaques were then picked from plates and, along with the \nwild-type phage, propagated in a culture of the MG1655 transformed with the given retron. These cultures were plated \nin MMB soft agar and grown overnight. SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) was added to \nsubmerge the wells and left for 4 h at 4 °C to extract phages. The buffer was then removed and filtered with a 0.2 μm \nfilter. For amplification-free sequencing, extracellular DNA was removed through DNase I treatment, with 20 U of DNase \nI (NEB, M0303S) per 1 mL of phage lysate, incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then inactivated at 75 °C for \n5 min. Phage were then lysed and DNA extracted using the Norgen Phage DNA Isolation Kit (Norgen, 46800).

Nanopore sequencing was performed \nusing an R9.4.1 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D) on a MinION device. Wild-type phage samples were prepped using the Ligation \nSequencing Kit (SQK-LSK114) and sequenced using an R10.4.1 flow cell (FLO-PRO114M) on a PromethION device. \nBase calling was performed using ONT’s Guppy (for phage mutants) or Dorado (for wild type phage) Basecaller software \non the high accuracy setting.\nNanopore sequencing reads for mutant and wild-type phage were assembled independently using the Geneious Prime \nsoftware and consensus sequences were mapped to reference genomes to identify mutations. Genes containing muta-\ntions in multiple phage escapees for a given retron were considered potential trigger genes. To confirm potential trigger \ngenes, wild-type phage was engineered to incorporate the individual mutations seen in the escapee (see Phage recom-\nbineering below). These engineered phage mutants were then tested for defense in the same retron-expressing bacterial \nstrain they were isolated from (see Testing retron defense against E. coli phages above).\nPhage recombineering\nTo make each phage mutant, a recombitron plasmid (as described in Fishman and colleagues [33]) with a 90 nt editing \ndonor was co-transformed with pORTMAGE (contains CspRecT and mutL E32K accessory genes for recombineering) into \na modified strain of E. coli MG1655 with inactivated exoI and recJ genes, as well as an arabinose-inducible T7 polymerase \n(bMS.346 [7], Addgene #220588). Individual transformants were picked from plates and grown in 3 mL LB media overnight \nin a shaking incubator at 37 °C. The following day, these bacterial editor cultures were diluted 1:100 in 3 mL MMB media \ncontaining 1 mM IPTG (GoldBio), 2 mg/ml L-arabinose (GoldBio), and 1 mM m-toluic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) to express the \nrecombineering machinery. Passaged cultures were grown for an additional 2–3 hs at 37 °C, then diluted to an OD600 of \n0.2 in a fresh culture of 3 mL MMB with inducers. Wild-type phage lysate was spiked into these cultures at a MOI of 0.1. \nThe infected cultures were then grown for 16–18 h in a shaking incubator at 37 °C. Cultures were then centrifuged for \n10 min at 3,434g and the supernatant was filtered at a 0.2 μm pore size to obtain clarified phage lysate. To increase the per-\ncent of edited phage in the population, this recombineering protocol was repeated using the newly isolated phage lysate as \nthe spike-in for a fresh batch of bacterial editors. Editing rates were monitored after every round of recombineering by PCR \namplifying the phage lysate with primers flanking the edit site and then Sanger sequencing those amplicons.\nAfter two rounds of recombineering, individual phage mutants were isolated by plaquing on a lawn of bacterial editors. \nTo do this, editors were grown overnight and passaged in 3 mL MMB with inducers for 3–5 h. Edited phage lysate was \ndiluted 1:10,000 in MMB media. Then, 5 µL of diluted lysate was spiked into 1 mL of passaged editor culture, all of which \nwas mixed into 20 mL of soft agar and poured onto a LB plate. Soft agar plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The \nnext morning, eight individual plaques were picked for each phage mutant, resuspended in 100 µL of SM Buffer, and left \nat 4 °C for at least 4 h to allow the phage to disseminate into the buffer. Amplification of the edit site followed by Sanger \nsequencing was again performed to screen for lysates containing the desired edit. Those lysates were further propagated \nto obtain high-titer phage mutants for use in subsequent experiments.\nIdentification of methylation sites in phage genomes\nTo identify N6-methyladenines in the Bas51 phage genome, we extracted phage genomic DNA (see Isolating Mutant \nPhages and Identifying Retron Trigger Genes) and sequenced on a PromethION device using the Ligation Sequencing \nKit (SQK-LSK114) and R10.4.1 flow cell (FLO-PRO114M) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Base calling with \nperformed using ONT’s Dorado software on super accuracy (SUP) settings with 6mA modification calling enabled. Reads \nwere then aligned to a Bas51 reference genome using Dorado. Methylated adenines were extracted using Modkit (ONT), \nfiltering for sites with>100x coverage and >60% methylation frequency. To generate logo plots, the flanking sequences \n10 nucleotides upstream and downstream of all sites passing the filter was extracted and fed to WebLogo3 software [41]. \nModkit’s motif search tool was used to quantify methylated adenines found in GATC and GTAC motifs.", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "41129495:14", "pdf_file": "/Users/viku/Documents/UIUC/work/PETase/data/retron/41129495.pdf", "title": "PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003042 October 23, 2025 1 / 19"}}

These were transformed into \nNEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli and clones were verified using Sanger sequencing.\nA ΔSqu1 strain of S. quinivorans was built using lambda Red-mediated recombineering [42]. Briefly, a FRT-flanked \nchloramphenicol-resistance gene was amplified with primers that add 50 bp homology arms to the regions immediately \nflanking the Squ1 operon in S. quinivorans. The amplicon was gel-purified and electroporated into a strain of S. quini-\nvorans expressing the lambda Red system. Correct clones were selected for by plating on LB agar containing chloram-\nphenicol and verified via Sanger sequencing of the Squ1 locus.\nTo perform the trigger assay, plasmids containing the methyltransferase (or an empty vector control) and/or \n Retron-Squ1 (or an empty vector control) were electroporated into S. quinivorans using the same electroporation set-\ntings and protocol as for E. coli, except that all incubations were done at 30 °C. Transformants were plated on LB agar \ncontaining the appropriate antibiotics and 1% glucose for repression of the Lac promoter. Three colonies were picked for \neach sample (biological replicates) and grown overnight in 0.5 mL LB media + antibiotics + 1% glucose in a deep 96-well \nplate (Thermo Scientific 260251) covered with an air-permeable seal (Breathe-Easier, Diversified Biotech) at 30 °C with \nshaking. The next morning, cultures were diluted 1:100 in 200 µL of LB media + antibiotics in a black, clear-bottom 96-well \nmicrotiter plate (Corning 3603). The plate was covered with a transparent air-permeable seal (Breathe-Easy, Diversified \nBiotech BEM-1) and incubated in a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO) with shaking at 37 °C for 18 hrs with OD600 \nmeasured every 10 min. At the 2 h time point, IPTG was added to all samples to induce the Lac promoter.\nEngineering retrons for recombineering in E. coli\nTo edit bacterial genomes using recombineering, retrons were modified to encode a recombineering donor in the \nreverse transcribed region of the ncRNA. This 70 nt donor incorporates a 10 nt deletion in the lacZ gene. Effector pro -\nteins were excluded from retrons for recombineering. The modified retrons were cloned into the pACYC-Duet1 back -\nbone (p15A ori, chloramphenicol resistance) where they are co-expressed with CspRecT under the constitutive J23115 \npromoter. These plasmids were then transformed into bMS.346 cells and immediately inoculated into 5 mL LB cultures, \nwhich were grown overnight, shaking at 37 °C. The next day, 25 µl of culture was collected, mixed with 25 µl of water, \nand boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. The same cultures were then passaged at a 1:100 dilution in fresh 5 mL LB and grown \novernight again, after which another set of boiled lysates was collected. 0.5 µl of each boiled lysate from Day 1 and Day \n2 of editing was then used as a template in 25 µl PCR reactions with primers flanking the edit site, which additionally \ncontained adapters for Illumina sequencing preparation. These amplicons were indexed and sequenced on an Illumina \nMiSeq or NextSeq 2000 instrument. Sequencing reads were processed with CRISPResso2 [ 43] (https://github.com/\npinellolab/CRISPResso2 ) to quantify the percentage of precisely edited genomes. The following equation was used to \ncalculate percent editing:\n \n% edited = 100∗ # of reads aligning to edited sequence\n# of reads aligning to edited sequence+ # of reads aligning to wild type sequence \nSupporting information\nS1 Fig.  Phage defense testing of retrons-Hch1 (a) and -Bpu1 (b) in bSLS.114 with overexpression.

Vonesch1†‡, Kevin R. Roy2,3†, Chelsea Szu Tu1, Friederike Steudle1, \nMichelle Nguyen2,3, Cosimo Jann1§, Lars M. Steinmetz1,2,3*\nIt is unclear how CRISPR editing outcomes vary across the genome and whether undesirable events such as struc-\ntural variants (SVs) are predictable or preventable. To define a genome-  wide map of editability, we performed \nwhole- genome sequencing on 1875 budding yeast clones edited across 16 chromosomes by CRISPR-  Cas9 and \ndonor- templated repair. We found that unintended edits, including short indels and SVs, were enriched in specific \ngenomic and sequence contexts. We developed a predictive model, SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk \nEvaluation), which revealed 4.8% of the genome as SV prone, consisting of 562 SV hotspots. Donor repair- \nenhancing strategies suppressed SV formation in regions with moderate, but not high, predicted risk. Applying \nSCORE to the Sc2.0 synthetic yeast genome revealed a markedly altered SV landscape due to the removal of en-\ndogenous repetitive elements and the insertion of loxP sites. Our study provides the genome- scale map of SV \nhotspots after CRISPR editing and predictive and experimental tools to mitigate their formation.\nINTRODUCTION\nCRISPR RNA- guided programmable nucleases have revolutionized \nresearch, medicine, and biotechnology by enabling precise and effi-\ncient editing of the genome. However, the potential for unintended \nmutations at on-  and off- target sites continues to raise concerns for \nbasic research ( 1), therapeutic (2 ), and industrial applications (3 ). \nCRISPR editing systems trigger genome editing by inducing either \nsingle- strand breaks (SSBs) or double- strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs \ncan lead to disruption of target genes through small insertions or de-\nletions via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology- \nmediated end joining (MMEJ) (4). DSBs can also be harnessed for \nincorporation of designed sequence changes by homology- directed \nrepair (HDR) with an exogenous template. However, in some in-\nstances, CRISPR- induced DSBs can lead to unintended structur -\nal variants (SVs), including large deletions, translocations, loss of \nchromosome arms, and partial aneuploidies (5 , 6). These SVs can \nhave serious adverse effects as they can lead to gene loss, silencing, \nor altering of gene function, and can precipitate chromosomal insta-\nbility and chromothripsis (7). Even nickase- based systems, including \nbase and prime editors, induce transient DSB formation at nicked \nsites that can yield SVs at both on- target and off- target sites (8–11). \nUnderstanding why SVs occur and predicting regions at risk for SV \nformation is thus relevant for all genome editing approaches. While \nexisting tools have enabled predictions of certain editing outcomes, \nsuch as editing efficiency (12,  13) and the spectrum of small indels \nresulting from NHEJ (14) and MMEJ (15), no tool is presently ca-\npable of predicting large- scale chromosomal rearrangements or \nlarge deletions.\nAlthough there are isolated reports of SVs occurring with a variety \nof CRISPR systems, comprehensive, genome- wide surveys character-\nizing their frequency and genomic distribution are currently missing. \nThis gap largely stems from the inherent limitations of conventional \ngenotyping methods [e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based \ntarget sequencing] in detecting SVs and a lack of approaches capable \nof characterizing unexpected editing outcomes such as SVs across the \ngenome in an unbiased fashion. Consequently, it is unclear how fre-\nquently SVs arise across any genome in response to CRISPR editing, \nwhether certain regions are at a particularly high risk, and if such loci \ncan be predicted based on sequence and chromosomal context. In \nthis study, we tackle this question using the budding yeast model sys-\ntem, as its relatively modest genome size allows for comprehensive \nwhole- genome sequence (WGS) assessment across many genomic \nsites. We analyzed WGS outcomes for thousands of edits spanning all \n16 nuclear chromosomes and found that most sites are edited cor -\nrectly and that off- target indels by Cas9 are virtually nonexistent. Un-\nexpectedly, however, we find that a subset of target sites is highly \nprone to forming SVs. We show that these SVs arise from competing \nlocal and/or distal sequence repetitiveness and built a machine learn-\ning model termed SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk \nEvaluation) to map the locations of all SV hotspots in the genome as \nwell as to assess the likelihood for correct editing at all SpCas9 tar -\nget sites.\nRESUL TS\nMapping intended and unintended CRISPR- Cas9 editing \noutcomes genome- wide\nTo explore the spectrum of CRISPR- Cas9 editing outcomes genome- \nwide, we used a multiplexed HDR template–based CRISPR editing \napproach we previously developed termed MAGESTIC (16) to edit \na laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sites spread across \nthe genome (Fig. 1A). To target the entire genome in an unbiased \nfashion, we designed a library of thousands of single- nucleotide and \nmultinucleotide variants (SNVs/MNVs) and short indels naturally \npresent in the species and which are spread throughout all 16 chro-\nmosomes.

The barcodes serve as unique edit identi-\nfiers and are integrated at a dedicated locus in the genome after edit-\ning. We used robotic colony picking and recombinase- directed \nindexing (REDI) (17) to pick 2260 haploid clones with barcodes \ncorresponding to verified guide- donor sequences for whole- genome \nsequencing (WGS). The picked clones encompassed three succes-\nsive versions of the MAGESTIC system (v1.1, v1.2, and v1.3), each \nincorporating iterative improvements in editing efficiency (Materi-\nals and Methods). Next, we prepared WGS libraries with a low- cost \nand efficient method we previously developed that bypasses the \nneed for genomic DNA extraction (18). We sequenced each genome \nat 5× coverage and mapped the intended and unintended mutations \nin each individual genome with a computational pipeline geared to-\nward assessing intended edits, short indels, and various types of SVs \n(fig. S1A and Materials and Methods).\nA total of 1875 clones harbored sufficient coverage at the target \nregions for calling editing outcomes (Fig. 1B and table S1). A total of \n1414 clones exhibited HDR template–encoded variants consistent \nwith the intended edits predicted by the genome- integrated barcodes. \nOf 346 MNV- intended edits, 57 (16.5%) did not incorporate all the \nSNVs present in the donor (fig. S1B), with variant incorporation rate \ndropping with distance from the “NGG” protospacer adjacent motif \n(PAM) (fig. S2A). We also noticed a subset of clones (139 of 1414) \nthat harbored not only the designed edit but also distal SNVs. These \nvariants were present in the cloning stage of the guide- donor plasmid \nlibrary and likely arose during oligonucleotide synthesis (fig. S2B and \nSupplementary Text). The likelihood of incorporation of a PAM-  \ndistal variant or synthesis error decreased as a function of distance \nfrom adjacent variants, reaching 50% incorporation rate at around \n10 bp distance and falling below 10% after 20 bp (fig. S2C).\nOverall, 358 of 1875 clones carried the wild- type sequence at \ntheir target sites. Notably, these unedited clones were overrepresent-\ned in earlier versions of the MAGESTIC system (fig. S3), with the \nmost recent version (MAGESTIC v1.3) exhibiting an 82.7% correct \nedit rate (1094 of 1323 sites). NHEJ indels were present at low levels \nacross all systems (11 of 1875 clones, or 0.59%), consistent with the \nNHEJ pathway being less error prone in S. cerevisiae relative to other \norganisms (19) and with few clones surviving via NHEJ indel forma-\ntion (20). We observed no evidence of gRNA- dependent off- target \nindels or point mutations (fig.  S4). gRNA- independent sequence \nchanges were present at a level consistent with the expected back-\nground rate of mutations arising from propagation in cell culture \n(21) (fig. S4). Collectively, our results demonstrate that unintended \noff- target indels and SNVs after CRISPR nuclease- based genome ed-\niting are exceedingly rare in S. cerevisiae and that editing is highly \nefficient and precise across the majority of sites.\nSVs are induced at target sites\nIn addition to the wild- type sequence and HDR-  and NHEJ- mediated \nedits, numerous clones exhibited substantial loss of sequencing cover-\nage at the target sites relative to the rest of the genome (figs. S1A and \nS5A). The specific depletion of mapped reads at target sites was sugges-\ntive of large- scale genomic changes such as SVs. To better understand \nthe occurrence of these events, we developed a pipeline to systemati-\ncally detect SVs across 2260 targeted regions and 654 computationally \npredicted off- target regions (with 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the corre-\nsponding gRNA) (Materials and Methods). Our analysis identified a \ntotal of 92 target sites with SVs (Fig. 1B), comprising 44 large deletions \n(DELs), 43 nonreciprocal translocations (TRAs), and 5 unclassified \nSVs. TRAs could be further subdivided on the basis of whether re-\nplacement of the target sequence reached the telomere (Fig.  1C and \nfig.  S5A). Complete chromosomal arm replacement events were de-\ntected exclusively in (sub)telomeric regions, whereas incomplete re-\nplacements were found throughout chromosomes (fig.  S6A). Both \nevents led to loss of sequence at the targeted site and duplication of se-\nquence from another chromosomal location (fig. S6B and table S2). As \nSV detection is influenced by sequencing depth, samples with lower \ncoverage (<5×) likely underestimated SV fractions. The true SV rate in \nthe editing pool is therefore expected to be slightly higher than the \n4.9% (92 of 1875) estimated from all strains, approaching 7% in sam-\nples with >10× coverage (24 of 345) (fig. S7). In addition to these 92 \nclones, we observed 8 clones with SVs at predicted off- target sites with \none or two mismatches to the gRNA, yielding a total of 100 SVs across \nthe entire dataset (Fig. 1D and table S3). Notably, six of eight off- target \nSVs occurred in regions with a single mismatch to the gRNA, two of \neight with two mismatches, and none with three mismatches, under-\nlining the risk of off- target cleavage at sites with high sequence similar-\nity to the target.\nMore than half of the DEL and TRA breakpoints, defined by the \nmismatched base at the end of the modified sequence within the target \nregion (fig. S5B), are flanked by ≥20 bp of perfect homology between \nthe target and a distal genomic region (Fig. 1E). This suggests that SV \nformation is not a pervasive outcome of DNA repair but rather is en-\nriched in genomic regions where endogenous homologous sequences \ncompete with the exogenous donor HDR template. Further inspection \nof the target loci yielding SVs revealed local repetitive sequences pres-\nent as tandem repeats in the case of deletions and distal repetitive se-\nquences in the case of nonreciprocal translocations. As confirmed by \nrecloning, editing, and sequencing of four target sites yielding SV clones \n(Supplementary Text and fig. S6C), the SV rate of a single guide- donor \npair ranged from 71.1 to 97.6% (Fig. 1F and table S4), substantially ex-\nceeding the genome- wide rate of 4.9% (92 of 1875 clones). Further-\nmore, sites with SVs exhibited slightly greater chromatin accessibility \n(versus unedited sites, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test’s P = 0.029, N = 178) \n(fig. S6D) and higher H2A S129 phosphorylation (H2AS129ph) level \n(versus unedited sites, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test’s P   =  2.7  ×  10−5, \nN  =  178) (fig.  S8). H2AS129ph (functionally equivalent to human \nH2AS139ph, also known as γH2AX) is transiently induced after DNA \ndamage (22) and found at higher levels in the S- G2 phases specifically in \nregions prone to DNA replication stress such as the subtelomeric re-\ngions (23). We reasoned that the correlation of SV incidence with \nH2AS129ph is likely a consequence of the sequence repetitiveness in \nthese regions, which leads to a high recombination rate and genetic in-\nstability (24). Together, these findings indicate that Cas9- induced SVs \nare context dependent and driven primarily by HDR in the yeast sys-\ntem. Their tendency to arise predominantly in repetitive regions sug-\ngests that these occurrences may, in fact, be predictable. This contrasts \nwith the limited studies on SV prevalence in mouse and human cells, \nwhere SV formation shows a predisposition to MMEJ pathways and \nwhere outcomes are highly heterogenous and do not appear to follow \nany predictable pattern based on the locations or lengths of micro-\nhomology sequences (25, 26).\nDevelopment of a machine learning model for predicting \nCas9- induced SVs genome- wide\nWe developed SCORE (https://apps.embl.de/score/) to predict the \nlikelihood of an SV or lack of editing for every SpCas9 target site in \nLi et al., Sci.

We \ncompared four machine learning algorithms (random forest, GBDT, \nand L1-  and L2- regularized logistic regressions) and found GBDT \nto be superior (fig. S10A). To mitigate the class imbalance of SVs \nand unedited clones compared to correctly edited clones, the correct \nedits were downsampled accordingly for the training data (fig. S10, \nB and C). Following model tunings and optimizations, the finalized \nSV predictor achieved an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Oper-\nating Characteristic Curve) of 0.949 and an AUPRC (Area Under \nthe Precision- Recall Curve) of 0.518 (Fig. 2C). All four SCORE sub-\nmodels substantially outperformed random classifiers (Fig.  2C). \nAnalysis of feature importance revealed long T homopolymers \n(16, 28) and gRNA sequence composition as the top variables pre-\ndicting the absence of editing (fig. S11). The editing system influ-\nenced baseline editing efficiency and acted as a confounding factor \nto the SCORE- unedit model (fig. S3A). Local and distal sequence \nrepetitiveness were the top variables predicting SVs, with no detect-\nable impact from the editing system (fig. S11). This finding aligns \nwith the observation that SV rates remained relatively consistent \nacross the three editing systems of varying efficiency (fig. S3A), sug-\ngesting that SV formation becomes the dominant repair outcome in \nrepetitive regions, obfuscating the editing machinery enhancements \noptimized for nonrepetitive regions.\nA map of the editable regions in the S. cerevisiae \nreference genome\nUsing SCORE, we conducted a genome- wide survey of editable re-\ngions encompassing all 873,419 NGG motifs with unique spacers on \n16 yeast chromosomes, excluding 66,538 sequences with perfect off- \ntarget matches (gRNAs that can bind to >1 genomic target without \nmismatches). The predicted scores for the absence of editing were \nscattered along the chromosomal axis, suggesting that local sequence \ncontext plays a major role over larger regional effects (Fig. 2D). In \ncontrast, sites with high SV probabilities were clustered into a hand-\nful of hotspots per chromosome (Fig. 2D).\nThe genomic distribution of SV scores showed a skewed, right-  \ntailed distribution, reflecting the low rate of SV formation for the ma-\njority of the genome, with only a small portion exhibiting elevated \nrisks. This hypothesis aligns with the low fraction of SVs observed in \nour pooled editing experiment (3.8 to 7.4%, fig. S3A) but high SV rate \nat individual target sites (Fig. 1E). On the basis of the empirical distri-\nbution of each predictive score, we established cutoffs to identify out-\nliers within the tails of each distribution (fig. S12; SV score  > 0.15; \nDEL score > 0.15; TRA score > 0.15; unedited score > 0.25) and cat-\negorize these sites as difficult- to- edit regions (DTERs). This approach \nidentified 4.8% of the genome susceptible to SV formation upon Cas9 \ncleavage (1.7% for DEL and 3.1% for TRA) and 11.1% of sites as like-\nly to remain unedited (table S7). By grouping sites in proximity with \nSV scores >0.15, we identified 562 SV hotspots across 16 yeast chro-\nmosomes, with an average cluster size of 2 kb and 57.9 PAM sites per \ncluster (table  S8). Of the regions at risk for SVs, 54.2%  overlapped \nwith protein- coding genes, indicating a depletion of SV hotspots \nwithin the 78.9% of the genome that codes for proteins (Fig. 2E). The \ndistribution of SV scores in essential genes and stress- responsive \nTATA box–containing genes (29) (Materials and Methods) showed \nno trend of increase or decrease compared to all coding regions \n(fig. S13). It is important to note, however, that SCORE does not con-\nsider the phenotypic impact of the editing outcomes, and it is possi-\nble, if not likely, that many of the SVs predicted in essential genes may \nnot lead to viable outcomes. As expected, SV- prone loci were more \nprevalent in telomeric and transposable elements, as well as tRNA \ngenes due to their repetitive nature (Fig. 2F and fig. S13). The ribo-\nsomal RNA genes, present as a long array of 100 to 150 tandem re-\npeats (30), were absent from our analysis as no gRNA sequences can \nuniquely target a single copy.\nWe further examined the relationship between our predicted SV \nlandscape and naturally occurring SVs that have arisen during the \nevolution of S. cerevisiae genome, as defined by a collection of 142 \ntelomere- to- telomere assemblies of yeast strains (31). We observed \nnot only an overall elevation in prediction scores at natural SV sites \nbut also a colocalization between natural SV breakpoints and local \npeaks in the prediction score (fig. S14). Although the SVs identified \nin our study were induced by artificial DNA DSBs (i.e., by the \nCRISPR- Cas9 system), this finding suggests that the underlying \nDNA repair outcome preferences are likely shared with those driv-\ning natural SV formation. Moreover, these repair outcome prefer -\nences, as observed in our laboratory strain, appear to be broadly \nconserved across natural S. cerevisiae populations and may have \nplayed a role in shaping the distribution of SVs throughout yeast \ngenome evolution.\nBoosting HDR efficiency reduces SV formation in DTERs\nOur results suggest that endogenous homologous sequences compete \nfor HDR at the target site with the donor template. Therefore, we sought \nto assess whether these alternative repair outcomes can be reduced or \nprevented through specifically enhancing donor template HDR effi-\nciency. Our dataset used an editing technique (MAGESTIC v1.3) that \nimproves HDR efficiency by active recruitment of double- stranded \nDNA (dsDNA) donor templates to DSBs (16). This donor recruitment \nsystem is based on a fusion protein consisting of the Fkh1 forkhead- \nassociated (FHA) domain, which recognizes phosphothreonine resi-\ndues accumulating around DSBs (32), and the LexA DNA- binding \ndomain (16) of the bacterial transcriptional repressor LexA. In a recent \nimprovement to MAGESTIC, we “supercharged” HDR activity through \ncombining three HDR enhancing techniques: in vivo single- stranded \nDNA (ssDNA) synthesis with a bacterial retron system (33), recruit-\nment of plasmid dsDNA and retron- generated ssDNA templates to \nDSBs via an MS2 coat protein (MCP)- LexA- FHA fusion protein, and \nin vivo assembly of linearized donor plasmid (34) [Fig. 3A; MAGESTIC \n3.0 (35)]. To assess whether SVs could be minimized through any or a \ncombination of these HDR enhancement strategies, we compared SV \nformation at eight target locations across six editing systems (tables S9 \nand S10), spanning from a minimal setup using only plasmid donor \nand Cas9 (termed Cas9- only) to the full MAGESTIC 3.0 (retron + \nrecruitment + assembly) combination system. We picked target sites \nreflecting a wide range of SV formation likelihoods as predicted by \nSCORE, including 3 DEL and 5 TRA sites. To facilitate evaluation of \nediting outcomes of many clones edited with the same guide- donor, we \nassessed SV formation via bulk WGS of the edited population of cells \ntransformed with guide- donor plasmids (or plasmid fragments in the \ncase of MAGESTIC 3.0) for each target (Materials and Methods).\nLi et al., Sci.

In vivo synthesis of ssDNA templates through \nreverse transcription (RT) (33) did not lead to a substantial reduc-\ntion in the SV fraction, except when ssDNA was recruited to the \nDSB by the MCP- LexA- FHA protein. This contrasts with previous \nstudies where the retron ssDNA donor system substantially im-\nproved rate of donor HDR at several non–SV- forming sites (33, 35), \nsuggesting that FHA- mediated recruitment is critical for successful \nediting of SV- prone sites. Editing efficiency at most of the tested loci \nwas superior in the four systems with FHA- mediated donor recruit-\nment, regardless of template type (Fig.  3, C and D). We observed \nlocus- specific differences in the SV fraction for different template \ntypes, with ssDNA retron donor recruitment being superior to ds-\nDNA plasmid donor recruitment at some sites (DEL2, FR2, and \nTR1) but not others (DEL1 and TR2) (Fig. 3D). Overall, the MAGES-\nTIC 3.0 system showed the highest fraction of correct donor-  \nmediated edits and the greatest reduction in SV formation in six out \nof eight loci (DEL1, DEL3, FR2, FR3, TR1, and TR2). In two of the \ntested loci (DEL1 and TR2), the estimated SV fraction was reduced \nfrom more than 50% in the Cas9- only setup to nearly zero, with a \nnear 100% efficiency for editing of the designed variant (Fig. 3D). In \naddition to preventing large SVs, the MAGESTIC 3.0 combination \nsystem also provided an advantage in overcoming smaller deletions \n(24 bp) at one locus (Fig. 3D, DEL2).\nWhile HDR enhancement approaches used in the MAGESTIC \n3.0 system generally reduced SV formation, some sites showed only \na weak or no improvement (e.g., FR1 and DEL3). Sites with different \ndegrees of SV reduction could be distinguished by their predicted \nSV scores: three sites with scores between 0.3 and 0.5 were effec-\ntively rescued, while four sites with scores above 0.8 were recalci-\ntrant to HDR enhancement (Fig.  3C). Overall, the SV score was \ncorrelated with the degree of SV formation suppressible by the \nMAGESTIC3.0 system (Pearson’s r = 0.71, P = 0.051, N = 8). This \nobservation suggests that SCORE can be used quantitatively to pre-\ndict a continuous variation of editing outcome likelihoods genome- \nwide. In summary, we conclude that amplifying and recruiting \nexogenous donor templates to Cas9 cleavage sites can outcompete \nendogenous homologous sequences as repair templates and prevent \nundesirable repair outcomes at regions with moderate SV risk.\nValidation of SCORE across an additional 1122 clones\nTo test the performance of SCORE across additional genomic re-\ngions not seen in the training data, we validated our model on an \nindependent panel of edits generated by the MAGESTIC 3.0 system. \nWe isolated 1122 clones edited across 220 loci with 883 unique \ngRNA sequences and performed WGS at an average depth of ~20×. \nOf the 1122 clones, 488 were targeted by LbCas12a at sites flanking \na 5′ TTTV PAM motif (table S11).\nSetting a threshold of SV likelihood score greater than 0.15, we \nflagged 186 of the 1122 clones as SV prone, which captured 94.3% \n(83 of 88) of true SVs confirmed by WGS (Fig. 4A). Despite SCORE \nbeing trained only on data obtained with SpCas9, this threshold de-\ntected SVs equally well in both the SpCas9 and LbCas12a libraries \n(SpCas9: 10 of 11; LbCas12a: 73 of 77), suggesting that the SCORE \npredictions for SV formation are generalizable across different nu-\ncleases (Fig. 4B and fig. S16).\nIn addition to the 0.15 threshold, we noticed that an SV likelihood \ncutoff of 0.5 was able to distinguish sites with an intermediate risk for \nSVs from sites with a high risk (Fig. 4, B and C). This was consistent \nwith HDR donor recruitment reducing SV incidence at sites with \nmoderate SV scores between 0.3 and 0.5, but not at four sites with \nhigh SV scores >0.5 (Fig. 3C). Similar to SpCas9, LbCas12a targets \nshowed an increasing SV rate with higher SV scores, albeit with an \noverall higher SV rate (Fig. 4B).\nThe ability of SCORE to stratify a CRISPR library based on unin-\ntended repair outcome profiles presents an effective strategy for \nproducing high- quality variant libraries and reducing false- positive \nhits by prioritizing clonal isolation and validation of edits in SV-  \nprone loci (Fig. 4D). For instance, targets with a low SV risk (0 to \n0.15) are safe for pooled experiments as they are expected to yield \npredominantly correct edits. For targets with moderate SV risks \n(0.15 to 0.5), arraying the edited population followed by sequence \nvalidation enables generation of clonal populations devoid of unde-\nsired genotypes. High- risk SV sites (>0.5) are more challenging to \nedit and likely require screening of a high number of clones to ob-\ntain a correct edit. These targets should be held out at the design \nstage or flagged during analysis to mitigate false- positive pheno-\ntypic interpretations.\nThe editable landscape of the synthetic yeast genome\nThe Sc2.0 synthetic yeast project involved the de novo design and \nsynthesis of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (36, 37). While based \non the laboratory strain S288C reference genome, each chromosome \nwas redesigned with major sequence changes to maximize genome \nstability and to enable previously unknown genomic functionaliza-\ntions. These included the deletion of repetitive elements, introns, and \ntRNA genes, recoding of tandem repeats within and between open \nreading frames (ORFs) by using synonymous changes that minimize \nrecombination potential, changing all TAG stop codons to TAA to \nfree up the TAG codon for future noncanonical amino acid incorpo-\nration, and the introduction of loxPsym sites for the SCRaMbLE \nsystem by Cre- lox induction (38).\nThe Sc2.0 gene content is closely related to the S288C genome \nused in the development and validation of SCORE, which allowed \nus to ask how the SV- risk landscape was altered by the design fea-\ntures mentioned above. We hypothesized that the removal of repeti-\ntive elements should reduce the fraction of the genome prone to SV \nformation and enable editing at sites previously uneditable in the \nlaboratory strain, including subtelomeric regions, loci with repeti-\ntive ORFs, and between tandemly repeated domains within ORFs. \nOn the other hand, we reasoned that the inclusion of the 34- bp lox-\nPsym sites could add potential for recombination, particularly large \ndeletions, when situated close together.\nWe applied SCORE to predict SV subtypes DEL and TRA across \n859,529 NGG sites on the 16 synthetic Sc2.0 chromosomes. As ex-\npected, hotspots with high TRA scores in the native S288C genome \nwere largely absent in their Sc2.0 counterparts (fig. S17). Chromo-\nsome III was the most affected, with five high- risk TRA regions in \nthe chromosome body and one in the telomeric region removed in \nSc2.0 (Fig. 5A). All synthetic chromosomes exhibited a lower frac-\ntion of high- risk TRA sites (TRA score > 0.5; fig. S18 and table S12), \nwith chromosome I and III showing the most substantial decreases \nby 74.4 and 86.6% relative to the S288C genome (from 1332 to 325 \nTRA- risk sites in chromosome I, and from 938 to 114 sites in \nLi et al., Sci. Adv. 11, eady9875 (2025)     31 October 2025\nScience Adv AnceS  |  ReSeAR ch AR ticLe\n8 of 16\nchromosome III) (Fig.  5B). While all chromosomes have similar \nlengths for the telomeric and subtelomeric regions, there is substan-\ntial variation in the chromosome arm length. Chromosomes I and \nIII have the largest subtelomeric- to- arm length ratios in the yeast \ngenome, due to their relatively short arms, resulting in the highest \nproportion of TRA- prone sites. On the other hand, the deletion \nlikelihood map was markedly altered by the presence of the 34-  bp \nCre- loxP sites, with a negative correlation observed between ad -\njacent loxP distances and the predicted deletion rate (Pearson’s \nr = −0.54, P < 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 5, A and C). It is not just the lox-\nPsym sites that are problematic for Cas9 targeting, but the regions in \nbetween the sites themselves are rendered deletion prone despite \ncontaining unique target sites.

Our analysis identified regions of the Sc2.0 genome that are \nlikely to be refractory to downstream modifications by CRISPR \nnuclease- based approaches. This example highlights the value of \nSCORE in advancing future de novo genome sequence designs that \nminimize deletion and translocation risks (Fig. 5C).\nDISCUSSION\nTo improve the accuracy and fidelity of CRISPR editing for applica-\ntions ranging from genome- wide screens to therapeutic editing, it is \ncritical to characterize the spectrum and frequencies of unintended \nchanges to the genome, from small- scale off- target point mutations to \nlarge- scale chromosome- level changes such as SVs. Furthermore, ed-\niting outcomes need to be assessed in diverse chromosomal contexts, \nas the endogenous DNA repair pathways responsible for generating \nvarious lesions in response to SSBs and DSBs can be locus- dependent \n(39–41). WGS of edited clones is the gold standard, yet a large- scale \nsurvey of thousands of sites is currently intractable in organisms with \nlarge complex genomes such as humans, where >500- fold more reads \nare needed to achieve the same sequencing depth as in yeast.

Adv. 11, eady9875 (2025)     31 October 2025\nScience Adv AnceS  |  ReSeAR ch AR ticLe\n10 of 16\nstudy, we analyzed 1875 edited yeast genomes randomly sampled \nfrom a genome- wide library of natural variants to explore editing out-\ncomes in an unbiased fashion. Our analysis revealed that the likeli-\nhood of SV formation upon CRISPR is not uniformly distributed \nacross the yeast genome, but rather strongly enriched within a limited \nsubset, within 4.8% of the genome, which exhibited frequent and re-\ncurrent SV formation (Fig. 1F). Notably, the risk of forming SVs per-\nsisted even in editing systems optimized for high editing efficiency \n(i.e., MAGESTIC v1.3 with > 80% efficiency, fig.  S3A) and is likely \nindependent of the targeting and cleavage machinery, including opti-\nmizations to the guide and the Cas nuclease or with different nucle-\nases such as LbCas12a (Fig.  4B). Our attempts to overcome SV \nformation with an improved donor template repair system using re-\ncruitment of retron- generated ssDNA donor templates and in  vivo \nplasmid assembly (MAGESTIC 3.0) were successful only at a subset \nof SV- prone loci (Fig.  3), indicating that a fraction of the yeast ge-\nnome is potentially off- limits to HDR- based editing approaches.\nOur data suggest that SVs in yeast are driven primarily by HDR \nwith endogenous homologies that can present themselves at a broad \nrange of distances from target sites, from several tens to many thou-\nsands of base pairs. This is likely because the resection of broken \nDNA ends at the target site can extend up to thousands of bases, \ngenerating partial single- stranded DNA that is exposed to the ho-\nmology search machinery, thereby enabling recombination to initi-\nate far from the DSB (42). Consequently, regions affected by SVs can \nlie at considerable distances from repetitive elements yet still harbor \nlarge stretches of uniquely targeting gRNA sequences without any \napparent off- target potential (fig. S19). This makes manual assess-\nments of SV likelihoods based on the local sequence context intrac-\ntable. To improve CRISPR editing outcomes, it is essential to \nconsider multiple layers of genomic context and identify the optimal \ncombination that maximizes editing efficiency while minimizing \nundesired outcomes. Achieving this requires not only modeling the \nrelationship between individual genomic features and editing out-\ncomes, but also the capacity to compare diverse feature combina-\ntions and determine the most favorable design and editing strategy. \nIn this regard, our machine learning model SCORE provides quan-\ntitative measures to meet these challenges. SCORE- unedit enables \nthe selection of high- efficiency guides by avoiding certain gRNA \nsequence compositions (e.g., long T stretches) and regions with \nlow chromatin accessibility. Complementarily, SCORE- SV evalu-\nates local and distal repetitive sequences at different context lengths \nto identify and avoid regions at high risk for SV formation. The \ngenome- wide set of SCORE predictions is available in an interactive \ngenome browser (https://apps.embl.de/score/) for the community \nto use for applications ranging from CRISPR editing of individual \nloci to genome- wide variant screens. Users can prioritize gRNAs \nwith high predicted efficacy and low predicted SV likelihoods and \nimplement additional steps to isolate correct edits in SV hotspots by \nusing MAGESTIC 3.0 to boost template repair and by screening \nmany clones (Fig. 4D). SCORE can also be used to improve variant \nscreens by prioritizing SV- prone loci for additional validation steps.\nThe propensity for DSBs to induce chromosomal rearrange-\nments and gene conversions close to the telomeric ends has previ-\nously been reported in budding yeast (43), mouse embryonic stem \ncells (44), and human cancer cells (45). Subtelomeric regions in eu-\nkaryotic chromosomes exhibit high sequence repetitiveness both \nwithin and between each other, a trait that may represent evolution-\nary adaptation to replication stress in these regions (46). The \ntendency toward nonreciprocal translocations in these regions in \nhaploid yeast is consistent with the enrichment of loss of heterozy-\ngosity toward telomeric arms observed in diploid wild isolates \nacross the yeast species (47), where it has been proposed to aid in \nthe expression of recessive phenotypes and to increase allelic diver-\nsification (47). Cells may have evolved higher rates of HDR in sub-\ntelomeric regions via break- induced replication (BIR) in response to \nthe greater prevalence of replication stress- induced DSB in these \nregions (46). Another factor contributing to the higher tendency for \nsubtelomeric translocations over exogenous donor HDR in our as-\nsay may be due to subtelomeric regions exhibiting elevated levels of \nSSBs (48), which have been shown to improve HDR efficiency when \noccurring on endogenous chromosomal donors (49). Supporting \nthis hypothesis, a study in S. cerevisiae reported higher survival rates \nof strains with DSBs near (sub)telomeric regions compared to inter-\nmediate chromosomal regions (43). Similarly, a study using a donor- \nfree CRISPR system in Yarrowia lipolytica observed higher fitness of \ncells with gRNAs targeting subtelomeres (50), from which they con-\ncluded a lack of cutting activity at these sites. However, our and oth-\ners’ investigations of repair outcomes (43) suggest that CRISPR \nnucleases cut efficiently near chromosome ends, but that DSBs in \n(sub)telomeric regions are readily resolved by repair with endoge-\nnous chromosomal donors, leading to SV formation and cell sur -\nvival. Overall, understanding the genome- wide distribution of \nrepair outcomes, informed by genomic contexts, would enable edit-\ning strategies to overcome or at least manage the risk of erroneous \noutcomes. Efforts to modulate these pathways toward preferred out-\ncomes have included chromatin remodeling (51), mismatch repair \nmanipulation ( 52), or enhanced donor HDR [e.g., MAGESTIC \n3.0 (35)].\nThe consideration of long- range genomic context is a major dif-\nference between SCORE- SV and previous computational models, \nwhich so far have been limited to associating local sequence con-\ntexts with editing efficiency [e.g., for Cas9 nuclease (12), base editors \n(53), and prime editors (54)] and for predicting smaller- scale unin-\ntended on- target outcomes, such as NHEJ indels (14, 55), bystander \nedits (53), and pegRNA scaffold insertions. While it is well- \nestablished that nuclease efficiency and NHEJ- induced indels are \ninfluenced by the local sequence context (12, 14), our findings high-\nlight the importance of long- range sequence features, chromatin \nstate, and chromosomal context (e.g., proximity to telomeres). Mod-\nels trained on editing outcomes from reporters outside of the en-\ndogenous genomic context (e.g., those based on editing artificial \nconstructs or endogenous target sites removed from their native lo-\ncus) are likely to fall short in predicting large- scale events, which \nmay occur only in specific chromosomal regions. Therefore, it is \ncrucial to have methods capable of capturing both small- scale and \nlarge- scale changes. Various non- WGS methods have been devel-\noped to characterize particular classes of SVs at target sites in hu-\nman cells, including anchor- based Tn5 approaches to capture \ntranslocations that preserve one side of the target site (e.g., PEM- \nseq) (56), Southern blotting or use of panels of primers flanking the \ntarget site combined with long- read sequencing to capture mid- size \n(hundreds of base pairs to several kilobases) deletions (9) or unan-\nticipated insertions (57), and single- cell RNA sequencing to infer \nlarge deletions or chromosomal arm loss (6). Each of these methods, \nhowever, has limitations and may fail to detect certain types of SVs \nat target sites. Complementary to these approaches are copy number \nanalysis by droplet digital PCR (58) and loss of fluorescence from \nLi et al., Sci. Adv. 11, eady9875 (2025)     31 October 2025\nScience Adv AnceS  |  ReSeAR ch AR ticLe\n11 of 16\nsingle- copy insertions of GFP reporters at or near target sites to in-\nfer target site disruption (26). While these assays provide valuable \ninsights, they are difficult to scale across multiple genomic sites \nand offer only limited information about the sequence at the SV \nbreakpoints, which is important for developing predictive models \nfor SV formation.\nOne limitation of the current study is that the SV landscape was \ncharacterized in a single laboratory strain background of S. cerevisiae \nusing a single CRISPR- Cas9–based editing system (MAGESTIC). \nBecause our predictive model, SCORE, was trained on this dataset, \nit may be biased toward the DNA repair preferences of this strain \nunder these specific conditions (i.e., donor recruitment). However, \nit is likely that the model can be generalized to other systems with \nsimilar DNA repair profiles, specifically those with high proficiency \nin HDR over error- prone pathways such as MMEJ. Supporting this, \nwe observed that SV breakpoints in 142 natural yeast isolates (31) \nfrequently overlapped with SV- prone sites identified in our labora-\ntory strain (fig. S14), suggesting that these strain backgrounds may \nshare similar vulnerabilities to SV formation upon natural or arti-\nficially introduced DSBs (i.e., by the CRISPR- Cas system). For or -\nganisms more distantly related to S. cerevisiae (e.g., human), we \nanticipate that a similar set of genomic features used in SCORE (i.e., \nlocal and global sequences and chromatin context) could be applied \nto predict SV likelihoods, at least those driven by HDR- mediated \nprocesses. However, the model would need to be retrained to cap-\nture the species- specific DNA repair preferences. The observation \nthat a larger variety of SV types can arise in human cells (e.g., \nMMEJ- mediated deletions, NHEJ- mediated translocations and in-\nversions, and chromosome arm truncations) make both the unbi-\nased detection and modeling more challenging than in the yeast \nsystem. In addition, SVs in yeast appear to be confined to a specific \nsubset of the genome where they occur systematically at a very high \nrate, such that most of the genome exhibits little- to- no detectable \nSV formation. In contrast, studies on mammalian systems have re-\nported large deletions across a wide range of frequencies for all tar-\nget sites thus far examined, ranging from 0.2 to 17.5%, depending \non the chromosomal context and cell type (9). These deletions ap-\npear to be largely driven by microhomologies that cannot be readily \npredicted by sequence context alone (25). Key questions remain un-\nanswered about whether SV rates vary across the genome and \nwhether there are SV hotspots in mammalian genomes as we found \nin yeast. It is likely that existing studies have not examined a suffi-\nciently large or representative set of genomic sites for building pre-\ndictive models for editing outcomes. Future efforts should focus on \ndeveloping scalable approaches to map the wide range of possible \nSVs observed in mammalian systems.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nY east strains\nThe BY- derived haploid strain DHY214 was used as the base strain \nfor editing with MAGESTIC, with additional modifications on the \nlanding pad of genome- integrated barcodes depending on the edit-\ning system version. A complete list of the genomic landing pads and \nplasmid backbones is shown in table S10.\nGenome editing and barcoding\nWe performed highly multiplexed and parallel editing of the de-\nsigned variants using published protocols (16), with adjustments \ndepending on the version of the editing system. Libraries of gRNA \nand donor DNA pairs were designed to incorporate polymorphisms \npresent in strains RM11 or SK1 relative to the S288C reference ge-\nnome. We tested the performance of three successive improvements \nto our MAGESTIC editing system, named MAGESTIC v1.1, v1.2, \nand v1.3 (n = 81, 471, and 1323, respectively), for the installation of \nseveral natural variant libraries. Compared with MAGESTIC v1.0 \n(n  =  52), the newer versions were optimized by replacing the \ngalactose- inducible GAL1 promoter with the constitutive TEF1 pro-\nmoter for Cas9 expression (v1.1), replacing the tRNA(Tyr)- HDV \npromoter with the SNR52 promoter for gRNA expression (v1.2), \nand adding a tetracycline- inducible RPR1- TetO promoter (59) to \ndrive expression of the gRNA used for the barcoding step to tempo-\nrally separate editing from barcoding (v1.3). A barcode reference \ntable was constructed for each library by amplifying the guide- \ndonor- barcode region from the plasmid libraries at the first stage of \ncloning (before inserting the sgRNA scaffold and markers in be-\ntween the gRNA and the donor) with indexed Illumina primers.\nRecombinase- directed indexing\nEdited and barcoded yeast library pools were plated from glycerol \nstocks onto YPD plates and grown for 2 days at 30°C. Single colonies \nwere randomly selected and arrayed into 384- well plates using an \nautomated colony picking robot (RapidPick Lite, Hudson Robotics). \nAfter an overnight growth at 30°C, four 384- well plates were com-\nbined into a 1536- well array using a Singer RoToR HDA (Singer In-\nstruments, UK) and used for REDI. Briefly, the MAT α haploid \nstrains were mated with barcoded MAT a REDI strains arrayed in \n1536- well format using the Singer RoToR. Through Cre- induced re-\ncombination of the barcode locus (induced by pinning on SC- \nURA  +  GAL plates), a single allele in the diploid strain contains \nboth the editing barcode (informing on the installed variant) from \nthe MATα strain, and the 1536- well plate index barcode from the \nMATa parent. To determine the position of specific edited variants \non the array, the mated cells were washed off the plate, genomic \nDNA was extracted with a kit (Epicentre), and the barcode locus \nwas amplified via PCR using indexed Illumina primers. The result-\ning reads (sequenced on Illumina MiSeq system, 2 × 150 bp) were \nmerged using BBMerge ( 60), plate positions were identified via \nmapping of index barcodes to the set of available index barcodes \n(only perfect matches considered), and variants were identified by \nmapping the MAGESTIC barcode to the barcode reference table.\nFor clones generated with the v1.3 system REDI batch 2 (table S1), \ntwo separate PCRs were necessary to map MAGESTIC barcodes to \nindex barcodes due to a different structure of the barcode locus. \nHere, the first amplicon linked the MAGESTIC barcode and the do-\nnor DNA fragment, whereas the second amplicon linked the index \nbarcode and the donor DNA. MAGESTIC barcodes were mapped to \nindex barcodes by aligning donors from each amplicon to the set of \ndesigned donors using BLAST+ (61).\nThe selected set of variants was picked with a colony picker using \nthe index barcode information and rearrayed into 96- well microwell \nplates, grown overnight, and stored as glycerol stocks. Selection cri-\nteria included that each variant be represented with a maximum of \nfour barcodes, without sequence errors in the gRNA sequences \n(batches 1 and 2), and without sequence errors in the 60- nucleotide \n(nt) region centered on the target mutation in the donor DNA re-\ngion (batch 2). In batch 1, we allowed sequence errors anywhere in \nthe donor DNA to assess the impact of synthetic donor errors on \nLi et al., Sci. Adv. 11, eady9875 (2025)     31 October 2025\nScience Adv AnceS  |  ReSeAR ch AR ticLe\n12 of 16\nediting efficiency and rate of incorporation of the donor errors into \nthe genomic edits\nWGS library construction\nSelected strains were inoculated into 100 μl of YPAD from glycerol \nstock and grown overnight at 30°C, 800 rpm. WGS libraries were \nprepared using our extraction- free method (18) and, following the \nprotocol described in File S1, adapted to a 96- well format. We used \nthe triple mutant homemade Tn5 and the protocol version with Pro-\nteinase K treatment for nucleosome dissociation. Magnetic bead \ncleanup after Proteinase K treatment was performed on a liquid \nhandling robot (Biomek Fxp, Beckman Coulter), while samples \nfrom the entire plate were pooled for cleanup after the PCR step. \nSamples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using 2 × \n150- bp reads, at an estimated coverage of 5×. As the site of the target \nedit is known by virtue of the MAGESTIC barcode, we reasoned \nthat such low coverage is sufficient to detect the editing outcome at \nthe target site.\nRead data processing and editing outcome identification\nRaw reads in FASTQ format were processed by trimming off adapter \nsequences using cutadapt (62) and mapped to the sacCer3.0 refer -\nence genome (http://sgd- archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_ \nreference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64- 2- 1_  \n20150113.tgz) using bwa- mem (63). The mapped BAM (Binary \nAlignment/Map) files were sorted and marked for PCR duplicates, \nand the base quality scores were recalibrated using GATK4 (64).\nFollowing successful MAGESTIC barcoding, a portion of the \nguide- donor plasmid, including the full- length donor template, in-\ntegrates into the genome at the landing pad. Reads overlapping the \nbarcode region can be partially mapped to the target site due to se-\nquence similarity in the gRNA and donor region, leading to false \ndiscovery of intended edits. To prevent this, a custom script was \nimplemented to filter out reads containing chimeric junctions, \nwhich suggest origins from barcode sequences or residual plasmid \nfragments in the WGS libraries. Last, variant calling was performed \nusing GATK4 HaplotypeCaller (SNV and indel) and SvABA (65) \n(SV), followed by downstream analysis to define different categories \nof editing outcomes.\nTo distinguish intended from unintended variants at the target \nsites and account for incomplete editing of MNVs, we developed an \nannotation method based on edit distances (Levenshtein). A variant \nis classified as intended if its addition to a wild- type sequence re-\nduces the edit distance to the donor template; otherwise, it is classi-\nfied as unintended. This approach also characterizes editing status \nof oligo synthesis errors by treating them as additional designed \nvariants on donor templates. A schematic of the variant definition is \nshown in figs. S20 and S21.\nSV identification and annotation\nShort read- based algorithms for SV detection are known to be sub-\noptimal under certain conditions (e.g., repetitive or highly mutated \nregions, low sequencing depth) that lead to low recall and high false- \npositive rates (66). In this study, we used a three- way cross- validation \napproach to ensure accurate SV annotation across diverse target \ncontexts. Potential SVs were preselected by three methods indepen-\ndently: (i) on- target deletions or translocations identified by SvABA; \n(ii) unintended SNVs or indels within 200 bp up-  or downstream of \nthe target site identified by GATK4 HaplotypeCaller; and (iii) copy \nnumber loss detected by reduced read coverage at the target site. \nSubsequently, regions containing at least one of these signatures \nwere visually inspected and compared to unedited controls in the \nIGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) (67) to confirm true SVs.\nCopy number changes at target sites were assessed using a \ncustom script. Binned coverage metrics were computed for each \nWGS sample with a 250- bp bin size, resulting in an m  × n matrix, \nwhere m is the number of samples and n  is the number of bins. \nRaw read counts were normalized for library size variation using \nDESeq2 (68), yielding a matrix X = /parenleft.s1x1,1 ⋯x1,m ⋮⋱⋮ xn,1 ⋯xn,m\n/parenright.s1 , \nwhere xi,j denotes the normalized read count in bin i  of sample  \nj. These counts were then converted to ranks across bins: R i,j =  \nrank of xi,jin (x1,j,x2,j,…x n,j)\nn ,(i= 1, 2… n ) . The inverse of R i,j reflects the \nlikelihood of a region being under- sequenced, indicating poten -\ntial copy number loss. To rule out background variation in read \ndepth (e.g., from Tn5 insertion bias or GC content), the “rank of \nrank” (RoR) was computed to normalize ranks across samples: \nRoR i,j=\nrank of Ri,j in (Ri,1,Ri,2,…R i,m )\nm  , \n/parenleft.s1j=1, 2… m /parenright.s1\n . Bins with RoR  < \n0.1 were considered as signals of copy number loss.\nTo identify corresponding regions involved in repair at SV loci, \nreads containing unexpected variants relative to the target site (SNVs, \nsoft- clipped sequences) were aligned against the reference genome \nusing blastn (61) (table S2). On the basis of the location of detected \nhits, the variants were classified as deletions or translocations. In case \nof translocations, the alignment of the template regions was inspect-\ned in IGV to search for potential reciprocal translocations.\nAnalysis of off- target mutations\nGenomic Call Variant Format (GVCF) files were generated from the \nBAM files of 2260 genomes and combined into a single file using the \n“GenotypeGVCFs” command of GATK4. Variants in the combined \nVCF (Call Variant Format) file were filtered to exclude low- quality \ncalls with the expression “QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0 || SOR > \n3.0 || MQRankSum <  −12.5 || ReadPosRankSum <  −8.0. ” Addi-\ntional filters were applied to exclude the following: (i) variant loci \nwith missing genotype “ . ” in >50% of samples; (ii) samples with \nmissing genotypes “ . ” in >50% of loci; and (iii) variants shared across \nmultiple samples with different gRNA sequences. For the remaining \nvariant loci, genomic sequences ±25 bp around the PAM site were \nextracted and aligned to the gRNA sequence (20 nt  + NGG) using \nthe semiglobal algorithm (gaps are allowed at the beginning or ends \nof the shorter gRNA sequence but not the longer genomic sequence). \nAlignments were performed in both forward and reverse direction, \nwith the best hit retained per locus. The edit distance between the \nbest hit and the gRNA sequence is depicted in fig. S4B.\nQuantifying genomic repetitiveness using local and distal \nrepetitiveness indexes (ILR, IGR)\nFor any given genomic location, the local sequence repetitiveness \nscore ILR [as originally defined and termed as Ir (27)] was calculated \nfor a defined window size (50 bp, 100 bp, 500 bp, 1 kb, 5 kb, or 10 kb) \ncentered at the target site (defined as the first nucleotide of the PAM \nsequence). ILR describes the complexity of a given DNA sequence by \nthe length of the shortest unique substring at each base position. \nInspired by this concept, we developed a custom script to compute \nIGR, which quantifies the global repetitiveness through mapping the \nshortest unique substrings between a target region (50 bp, 100 bp, \n500 bp, 1 kb, 5 kb, or 10 kb) and the rest of the genome. The script is \nLi et al., Sci.

Tandem \nrepeat length was defined as the longest homologous sequence (with \na maximum of one mismatch) between the left and right PAM- \nadjacent regions (with 25 bp, 50 bp, 250 bp, 500 bp, 2.5 kb, or 5 kb \nper arm), excluding matches in opposite strand directions (i.e., ex-\ncluding inverted repeats).\nPredictive model construction\nFeaturization\nThree sets of genomic features describing the target- specific context \nand two technical variables (designed variant type and editing sys-\ntem) were included in the training of SCORE (table S5) to regress out \nconfounding effects. Feature subset 1 includes all metrics relevant to \nthe local sequence context of a targeted site (20 bp gRNA sequence \n±5 bp, GC content, and T homopolymer score). Feature subset 2 in-\ncludes chromatin accessibility and transcriptional and histone modi-\nfication status. Feature subset 3 includes metrics of repetitiveness and \ntarget location on chromosome (distance to telomere and centro-\nmere). Feature table preparation is detailed in Supplementary Text. \nFeatures applied for each SCORE predictor were determined based \non evaluating gradient- boosted decision tree (GBDT) performance \nacross all six combinations of the three feature subsets (fig. S10).\nHyperparameter tuning\nTo determine the optimal model for our task, we conducted a pilot \nanalysis comparing four algorithms: (i) GBDT, (ii) random forest, \n(iii) L1- regularized logistic regression, and (iv) L2- regularized logis-\ntic regression. A grid search was performed for hyperparameter \ntuning. Model performance was evaluated using repeated k- fold \ncross validation (repeat = 5, k = 3). The selection criteria included \nAUROC, AUPRC, and F1 score. Algorithm- specific hyperparame-\nters included the following: (i) number of trees, learning rate, and \ninteraction depth for GBDT; (ii) number of trees and random vari-\nables at each split (mtry) for random forest; and (iii) the penalizing \nfactor λ for L1-  and L2- regularized regressions.\nWe tested a set of strategies to address class imbalance in the train-\ning data (more correctly edited loci, fewer SVs, and unedited sites), \nincluding (i) random undersampling (RUS) of the majority class, (ii) \nrandom oversampling (ROS) of the minority class, (iii) Synthetic Mi-\nnority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) (69) oversampling of the \nminority class, and (iv) ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling ap-\nproach) (70) oversampling of the minority class. Undersampling was \ntreated as a hyperparameter with levels of 10, 20, 50, and 100% of the \noriginal majority class size. Each level was combined with one of the \noversampling techniques (RUS  +  ROS, RUS  +  SMOTE, and \nRUS + ADASYN) or applied alone (RUS only) to achieve a 1:1 class \nratio in the training set. These adjustments were applied only to the \ntraining data, while validation splits (within cross- validation) re-\nmained unchanged for evaluation. The optimal hyperparameter com-\nbination is outlined in table S6. Final predictors were trained by using \nthe complete dataset without a separate validation split. The output \npredicted value was min- max normalized to be displayed in the range \nfrom 0 to 1, i.e., SCORE- SV  =  (model output  −  SCORE- SVmin)/\n(SCORE- SVmax −  SCORE- SVmin), where min and max correspond to \nminimum and maximum values observed on the reference genome.\nFeature importance assessment\nFeature importance was defined based on permutations. Briefly, val-\nues of individual or grouped features were randomly shuffled across \nsamples, and the difference in AUROC before and after shuffling \nquantified the feature’s contribution to model performance. Each \ntest included 1000 permutations. The resulting AUROC values were \nused to determine 90% confidence intervals.\nFunctional annotations of genomic regions\nAnnotations of protein- coding, noncoding (tRNA or ncRNA), telo-\nmeric, and transposable element regions were extracted from the S288C \ngene annotation file (as part of the downloaded reference genome files \nat http://sgd- archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/ \ngenome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64- 2- 1_20150113.tgz). \nThese elements were mapped to 873,419 NGG sites across the S288C \ngenome. NGG sites not overlapping with any of the elements were \ncategorized as intergenic.\nSites overlapping protein- coding genes were further stratified \nbased on essentiality. The list of essential genes was downloaded from \nyeastMine (via the AllianceMine website: https://alliancegenome.\norg/bluegenes/alliancemine) using the “Retrieve all phenotypes \nfor all genes” panel, followed by “View - > View Rows” and filtering \nfor entries where “Phenotype Observable” equals “inviable. ” TATA \nbox containing genes, known to enrich for stress responsive genes, \nwere extracted from a previous publication (29) (see table S2 in the \nnoted reference).\nSV hotspot identification\nAn SV hotspot was defined as a cluster of NGG PAM sites in close \nproximity, which exhibited a high SV likelihood predicted by \nSCORE. Specifically, adjacent NGG PAMs with SCORE- SV > 0.15 \non either chromosomal strand were grouped into clusters. Clusters \ncontaining fewer than 10 consecutive SV signals were excluded. \nLast, the remaining clusters within 200 bp of each other were merged \nto form SV hotspots, as listed in table S8.\nNatural SV breakpoint analysis\nThe list of 4809 natural SVs was downloaded from the original pub-\nlication ( 31) as a supplementary table. SV- type annotations were \nretained as reported in the source, comprising six categories: con-\ntraction, duplication, deletion, insertion, inversion, and transloca-\ntion. For each SV , both the start and end coordinates were considered \nas distinct SV breakpoints, resulting in a total of 9618 breakpoints \nfor downstream analysis.\nFor each SV breakpoint, we defined a ±1050 bp window (i.e., \nfrom −1050 bp to +1050 bp), where all NGG PAM sites with avail-\nable predicted SV scores were extracted. These sites were then \ngrouped into 100- bp bins based on their relative distance from the \nSV breakpoints.\nAs our prediction scores have prefiltered PAM sites associated \nwith nonunique guide sequences (i.e., ones that would lead to mul-\ntiple cuts in the genome), these excluded positions did not contrib-\nute to the visualization of SV scores. Their distribution across bins \nwas instead analyzed separately by quantifying their fraction in each \n100- bp bin (i.e., fig. S14, bottom panel).\nMAGESTIC 3.0 editing system for SV- prone targets\nWe selected eight pairs of gRNA and donor templates causing differ-\nent types of SVs (DEL, FR, and TR) and residing at diverse chromo-\nsomal locations (table S9). For each target site, the same guide was \nused as that used in the natural variant library. To prevent the pos-\nsibility of the guide re- cleaving the target site after editing and \nLi et al., Sci. Adv. 11, eady9875 (2025)     31 October 2025\nScience Adv AnceS  |  ReSeAR ch AR ticLe\n14 of 16\npotentially leading to post- edit SV formation, multiple SNVs were \nengineered in the PAM- proximal region of the guide. The guide- \ndonor oligos were designed as 200- mers and cloned into plasmid \nbackbones as described (35). For the nonplasmid assembly versions, \nthe cloned plasmids were transformed directly into yeast (table S10). \nFor guide- donor plasmid assembly in yeast, the guide- donor plas-\nmids were first digested by I- Sce I in  vitro and the guide- donor \nbackbones purified by gel extraction. Two hundred nanograms of \nthe resulting linearized guide- donor vectors was transformed with \n200 ng of pF811 insert (for I- Sce I and SaCas9- mediated barcoding) \n(table S10).\nAll yeast transformations were pelleted in PCR strips, resus-\npended in 50 μl of H2O, and 20 μl was transferred to 480 μl of com-\nplete synthetic medium lacking uracil, histidine, and leucine \n(CSM- Ura- His- Leu) in a deep well plate to select for maintenance of \nthe Cas9 plasmid, uptake of the guide- donor editing vectors, and \nprevention of premature barcoding, respectively. After 2 days of \ngrowth at 30°C with shaking at 800 rpm, 16 μl from this first out-\ngrowth was transferred to 484 μl of CSM- Ura- His- Leu for a second \noutgrowth (32- fold dilution to enable five generations). The next \nday, 16 μl was transferred to 484 μl of CSM- Ura- His + galactose \n(instead of glucose) to initiate barcoding and guide- donor plasmid \nself- destruction. For the MAGESTIC 3.0 SaCas9- barcoding system, \nanhydrotetracycline (1 μg/ml) was also added to induce SaCas9 and \nits guide X1. This was repeated for a second barcoding outgrowth. \nLast, 16 μl of the second barcoding outgrowths was inoculated into \n484 μl of CSM- His + 300 μM 5- fluorocytosine to counter- select for \nany cells harboring guide- donor plasmids while simultaneously se-\nlecting for successful integration of the HIS3- barcode–containing \ninserts at the chromosomal barcode (REDI) locus. Genomic DNA \nfrom these cultures was prepped using the MasterPure yeast DNA \nextraction kit (LGC Biosearch Technologies, Inc). WGS libraries \nwere prepared with the Illumina DNA prep kit (which uses Bead- \nlinked transposons). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina \nNovaSeq S4 lane by 2 × 151- bp reads by Novogene USA (Davis, CA).\nBulk WGS analysis\nRaw sequencing reads were processed and mapped to a customized \nS288C reference genome, incorporating several additional sequenc-\nes: (i) guide- donor plasmid, (ii) genomic landing pad of the MAGES-\nTIC barcode cassette, and (iii) editing cassette plasmid. Per- base \nread counts for each of the nine regions per sample were generated \nusing “samtools depth, ” including unedited sites as control for down-\nstream analysis.\nRaw read counts were normalized for library size by dividing by \nthe mean read depth per sample. Normalized counts were calculat-\ned for both unedited samples (with different gRNAs from the in-\nspected site) and the edited sample. Normalized coverage was \nindicated by the ratio of normalized counts in the edited sample to \nthat in the unedited control (averaged across all control samples). \nThis per- base coverage was binned using a sliding window of length \nadjusted based on region size (window size  = region size/25; step \nsize = region size/50). Coverage reduction (Δcoverage) was calcu-\nlated as (1 – normalized coverage), reflecting the fraction of bulk \nsamples with SVs.\nTo determine the composition of correct edits and unedited frac-\ntions, reads overlapping the targeted variant (or its wild- type se-\nquence) were extracted and counted. For each sample, the fraction of \nSV (Δcoverage) was subtracted from 1, and the remaining fraction \nwas partitioned into edited and unedited fractions according to the \nratio of read counts for edited and wild- type alleles.\nCreation of independent CRISPR- Cas9 and CRISPR- Cas12a \nlibraries using MAGESTIC3.0\nAn independent library of guide- donor plasmids was generated for \nMAGESTIC 3.0- based editing of all targetable variants in 112 previ-\nously mapped quantitative trait loci with SpCas9, LbCas12a, and im-\npLbCas12a nucleases, as described in a previous study (35). After \nediting and barcoding outgrowths, cells were plated for growth as \nsingle colonies onto CSM- HIS+5FOA (1 mg/ml) agar and were ar-\nrayed with a PIXL robotic colony picker (Singer Instruments, UK). \nThe integrated genomic barcodes for each clone were identified using \nREDI (as described above). Clones with barcodes corresponding to \nsequence- perfect guide and donor sequences were identified for a re-\narray step, followed by stamping with the ROTOR (Singer Instru-\nments, UK) [growth in 100 μl of YPD  + G418 (100 μg/ml) 96- well \nformat for genomic DNA extractions and −80°C archival in 384- well \nplates filled with 60 μl of YPD + G418 (100 μg/ml) +15% glycerol].\nThe integrated genomic barcode per clone was extracted from \nWGS data and mapped to a reference table to identify correspond-\ning gRNA and donor DNA sequences. Clones without barcode in-\nformation or with ambiguous barcodes were excluded. For the \nremaining 1122 clones, raw read processing, mapping, and outcome \ncalling were conducted as described above for the 2260 clones, with \nmodification to the reference genome to include variants specific to \nthe editing base strain version used in this editing experiment.\nFor the CRISPR- Cas9 library, no edit, SV , DEL, and TRA predic-\ntion scores were extracted from the precomputed table available on \nthe SCORE app website (https://apps.embl.de/score/). Predictions \nfor the CRISPR- Cas12a library were performed using our workflow \ndescribed above, with input coordinates adjusted to align with the \nformat used for Cas9 datasets.\nMapping SV- prone sites throughout the Sc2.0 genome\nSc2.0 genome sequences and annotation files were downloaded \nfrom the project website (https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc2- 0/\ndata/). The loxP site distance was defined as the base pair distance \nbetween the two adjacent loxP sites upstream and downstream of \nthe analyzed NGG site. SCORE predictions for SV , DEL, and TRA \nwere generated for all NGGs in the 16 synthetic chromosomes using \nthe models trained on the 1875 WGS datasets.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe PDF file includes:\nSupplementary text\nFigs. S1 to S21\nLegends for tables S1 to S12\nReferences\nOther Supplementary Material for this manuscript includes the following:\ntables S1 to S12\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n 1.
