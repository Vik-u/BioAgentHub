The family of NAD(P)H-dependent short-chain dehydrogenases/
reductases (SDRs) comprises numerous biocatalysts capable of
C = O or C = C reduction. The highly homologous noroxomariti-
dine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and
Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an
extended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR
from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto-reducing
activity, yet negligible imine-reducing capability, and mining
the Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Data-
base indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active-site
composition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR
accordingly improved its imine-reducing capability. By applying
the same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp.
77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto-reducing activity was engi-
neered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine-reducing
activity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines
can be rationally introduced into members of the “classical”
SDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be
a promising starting point for protein approaches to generate
new imine-reducing enzymes.
The NAD(P)H-dependent enzymatic reduction of C = N bonds
represents an attractive approach to chiral 1 ° , 2 ° , and 3 °
amines.
[1]
Whereas imine-reducing enzymes from metabolic
pathways have been known for long,
[2–4]
their strict substrate
specificity make them less attractive for biocatalytic applications
and has provoked the desire for biocatalysts with a relaxed
substrate scope. Three different strategies have led to such
imine-reducing enzymes: the identification of new enzyme
families, enzyme engineering, and/or the exploitation of
catalytic promiscuity.
By a screening approach, Mitsukura et al. discovered two
Streptomyces strains capable of reducing the cyclic imine 2-
methyl-1-pyrroline.
[5]
The identification of the underlying
NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases sparked the rise of the
imine reductase (IRED) enzyme family.
[6,7]
Bioinformatics
approaches increased the availability of putative IRED-coding
sequences, which are categorized in the Imine Reductase
Engineering Database.
[8]
IREDs are known to accept a broad
range of cyclic imine compounds as substrates, with some
catalyzing the reductive (alkyl)amination of carbonyls as
well.
[9–11]
Recently, the discovery of an enzyme family of native amine
dehydrogenases (nat-AmDHs) expanded the portfolio of en-
zymes suitable for the reductive amination of carbonyls.
[12]
These enzymes were identified by a sequence-driven approach.
As nat-AmDHs are not related to IREDs, this exemplifies the
natural diversity of imine-reducing enzyme families.
Protein engineering of enzymes facilitates the generation of
variants with desired properties. Successful approaches in the
context of NAD(P)H-dependent C = N reduction have been
demonstrated recently. Bommarius and co-workers applied
several rounds of protein engineering to change the substrate
scope of an amino acid dehydrogenase. The result was a variant
with four mutations that catalyzes the reductive amination of
ketones instead of α-keto acids.
[13]
Mutti and co-workers chose
an ɛ-deaminating l-lysine dehydrogenase as a scaffold for the
generation of amine dehydrogenases.
[14]
Nestl and co-workers used β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases
as a starting point for mutagenesis experiments. Certain
members of this enzyme family display a similarity to IREDs and
possess promiscuous C = N reducing activity. This activity was
enhanced by replacing an active site residue involved in the
native catalytic reduction mechanism.
[15]
Previously, we have reported on two homologous, promis-
cuous short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) from
plants capable of reducing C = N and C = O bonds: noroxomar-
itidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus
and Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae.
[16]
NR was originally
identified as an enone reductase (C = C reduction) involved in
alkaloid biosynthesis,
[17]
highlighting the versatility of SDRs.
In general, members of the SDR family are well character-
ized with respect to carbonyl and enone reduction, and several
candidates are used in biocatalytic applications. Protein engi-
neering has mainly been used to modify cofactor preference,

Lygidakis et al. used protein engineering to address the
catalytic scope of SDRs: the exchange of a single residue
enabled the switch from C = C (enone) to C = O reduction in SDRs
from Mentha piperita.
[23]
Our research related to SDR-catalyzed C = N reduction was
fortified by the observation that glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)
is capable of reducing iminium compounds (Scheme 1).
[18]
This
ability was unexpected: GDH was originally identified as solely
acting on sugar substrates. However, our finding along with the
above-noted examples of promiscuous C = N reduction suggest
that other enzymes may fulfill the prerequisites to behave as
imine-reducing enzymes. We therefore hypothesized that a
rational design of imine-reducing activity in SDRs should be
possible, which is backed by the previous examples of SDR
engineering.
Here, we report the generation of a new imine-reducing
enzyme resulting from a rational mutagenesis approach.
Inspired by the unique active site compositions of NR and
Zt_SDR, four mutations transformed an unrelated SDR with
distinct keto-reducing activity into a promiscuous enzyme with
additional imine-reducing activity. In addition to our previous
results
[16,18]
and literature examples,
[15,24]
this highlights that a
strict border splitting “ketoreductases” and “imine reductases”
can be misleading.
We previously identified new imine-reducing SDRs by BLAST
search with the sequence of NR as a template. The highly
similar Zt_SDR (87 % sequence identity) was discovered in
transcriptomic data of a related plant species. A “common”
BLAST resulted in hits with 60–70 % overall sequence identity.
From these hits, an SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR,
66 % sequence identity) was investigated.
[16]
Despite the
elevated sequence identity, Ao_SDR preferred keto substrates
and featured only a negligible imine-reducing activity. This
suggested that a solely sequence-driven approach is insuffi-
cient, and SDR-catalyzed C = N reduction probably results from
an interplay of several key positions.
We intended to determine such positions in parallel by
alanine scanning of Zt_SDR active site residues
[25]
and by
elucidating the structure in complex with NADP
+
and an imine
substrate. The structure of Zt_SDR was solved in complex with
NADP
+
and compared well to the structure of NR (see the
Supporting Information); however, a substrate or inhibitor could
not be co-crystallized thus far. The alanine scan revealed that
next to the SDR-typical catalytic triad
[26]
(positions S144, Y159,
K163 according to the standard numbering scheme for
“classical” SDRs
[27]
), three proton-donor flanking residues Y100,
C150, H158 (standard positions 96, 146, 156) mediate imine
reduction.
[25]
This pattern was extended by polar residues that
are common in the substrate binding site of NR and Zt_SDR
(N102, C149, T/S199; standard positions 98, 145, 197), but do
not occur at the equivalent positions in Ao_SDR (T124, I171,
V221). These positions were considered to be promising targets
for engineering of imine-reducing activity (Figure 1, Table 1).
Hence, six mutations (F122Y, T124N, I171C, A172C, L180H,
V221S) were expected to improve the imine-reducing activity of
Ao_SDR. The mutations were gradually introduced by site-
directed mutagenesis, and the variants were tested as purified
enzymes. This enabled the capturing of possible synergistic
effects of the mutations, while drastically reducing the exper-
imental effort of screening all 63 possible variants. β-Carboline
1 was converted in traces (< 5 %) by the wild-type enzyme
[16]
and therefore was used as the imine model substrate. The

conversion was determined by
1
H NMR spectroscopy, while the
low solubility of the substrate impeded the determination of
the specific activity. To monitor changes of the ketoreductase
activity, the specific activity of the variants was determined with
(R)-3-methylcyclohexanone (5) as a substrate (Table 2). The
twofold variant (F122Y/L180H) with exchanges of flanking
residues at standard positions 96 and 156 displayed a slightly
improved conversion of 1 (6 %) and a sixfold decreased
ketoreductase activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Next,
a cysteine residue at standard position 146 was introduced,
resulting in a further increase in conversion of 1 to 9 %.
Interestingly, this variant displayed an elevated ketoreductase
activity compared to the 2-fold variant. The exchange of valine
at standard position 197 by serine did not influence the imine-
reducing capability, but the additional substitution of threonine
at standard position 98 by asparagine resulted in a 5-fold
variant with the highest conversion of 1 (17 %). Its ketoreduc-
tase activity was reduced to 13 % of the wild-type activity.
Introducing a cysteine at standard position 145 to complete the
sixfold variant resulted in a decrease in imine-reducing activity
and a further reduction in ketoreductase activity to 1 % of the
wild-type activity. Thus, the five mutations F122Y/T124N/
A172C/L180H/V221S significantly promoted the imine-reducing
capability of Ao_SDR, although it was still lower than the
capability of NR and Zt_SDR.
To confirm the functional relevance of the flanking and
consensus positions (Figure 1, Table 1), an in silico screening for
SDRs with imine-reducing activity was performed assuming a
similar structure of “classical” SDRs even at low sequence
identity.
[28]
Therefore, the Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reduc-
tase Engineering Database
[27]
was scanned separately for
sequences with tyrosine, asparagine, cysteine, cysteine, histi-
dine, or threonine/serine at standard positions 96, 98, 145, 146,
156, or 197, respectively. Interestingly, none of the 130000 SDR
sequences had more than three matching positions.
Nevertheless, six protein sequences from Amaryllidaceae
transcriptomes from the 1000 Plants (1KP) project
(Table S8)
[29–33]
matched at least four of the six flanking/
consensus positions (Table 1). One of these six proteins, the
SDR from Phycella cyrthanthoides (Pc_SDR, 88 % sequence
identity to NR, M98 instead of N), was tested and showed
imine-reducing activity (Table S9). As the proposed pattern
occurs only in Amaryllidaceae SDRs, thus representing a tiny
subgroup of a large enzyme family, it might be regarded as a
specific solution for imine reduction. Nevertheless, we hypothe-
sized that the pattern derived from NR and Zt_SDR is
exploitable and transferable to other SDRs.
To challenge this hypothesis, we elected to test SDRs as
wild types and engineered for imine-reducing activity according
to the established pattern. From the database hits, we chose an
uncharacterized SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR)
containing Y96 and T197 (35 % sequence identity to NR). As a
second candidate, a GDH from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str.
168 (Bs_GDH) was selected, which is known to be active
towards a highly reactive iminium compound.
[18]
Based on the protein sequence of M77_SDR and the
engineered variants M77_SDR_opt (F97N, A142C, I143C, S151H)
and Bs_GDH_opt (E96Y, P98N, V146C, H147C, F155H, N196S),
synthetic genes were ordered codon-optimized for expression
in Escherichia coli. The genes were cloned into pET28a by In-
Fusion cloning, overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) using
auto-induction medium,
[34]
and purified by Ni   NTA affinity
chromatography. Despite several first-shell residues being
exchanged, the “optimized” variants remained soluble.
The catalytic scope of the candidates was explored by
testing three imine compounds (1–3), one iminium compound
(4), and two keto substrates (5, 6), alongside the glucose/GDH
NADPH regeneration system (Table 3). Both Bs_GDH and Bs_
GDH_opt were active with ketone 5, but neither catalyzed C = N
reduction of the tested substrates 1–3. Moreover, Bs_GDH_opt
lost the GDH activity and the ability to reduce the activated
derivative of iminium compound 4 (data not shown).
[18]
M77_SDR proved to be an active enzyme and converted
ketones 5 and 6 quantitatively with moderate stereoselectivity,
displaying high activity with 5 (28.1 U mg
  1
). These results
indicate that M77_SDR is a ketoreductase, corroborated by the
finding that no C = N reduction was observed with substrates 1–

4. As proposed, M77_SDR_opt catalyzed both C = O and C = N
reduction. While displaying reduced ketoreductase activity
(1.36 U/mg with 5), M77_SDR_opt accepted imine 1 (6 %
conversion), imine 2 (28 % conversion, ee > 99 % (R)-2 a), and
iminium 4 (20 % conversion, ee 86 % (R)-4 a) as substrates.
Interestingly, relative to the wild-type, M77_SDR_opt showed
an improved stereoselectivity (ee > 93 %) with regard to the
alcohol products 5 a and 6 a.
In summary, we have shown that imine-reducing activity
can be introduced into members of the “classical” SDR enzyme
family. We implemented an amino acid pattern, obtained from
the imine-reducing SDRs NR and Zt_SDR, in the unrelated
ketoreductase M77_SDR, the latter with no obvious link to
imine reduction. The resulting 4-fold variant M77_SDR_opt
catalyzed as a new activity C = N reduction at the expense of
C = O reduction activity. This proof-of-concept extends the scope
of SDR engineering towards imine reduction.
The identified pattern enables imine reduction; however, it
is not necessarily sufficient
[35]
as seen for Bs_GDH_opt. The
protein scaffold of the engineering target also impacts activity
as it determines a) the arrangement of the introduced amino
acids and b) elements that can influence or are required for
activity, such as structural flexibility or long-range electrostatic
interactions. The results obtained for Pc_SDR indicate that
standard position 98 tolerates slight variations, which is in line
with the results of the alanine scan of Zt_SDR.
[25]
This has been
shown for standard position 146 and might also apply for other
positions of the pattern. Moreover, this illustrates the complex-
ity of the rationale behind imine reduction catalyzed by SDRs,
as well as the need for a more comprehensive knowledge of
the underlying pattern and its influence on the structure–
function relationship.
In a more general context, this work underscores that one
SDR scaffold (e. g., NR, M77_SDR_opt) can meet the require-
ments for different reductive activities (here C = O, C = N reduc-
tion). With the latter activity being engineered, our work has
revealed that the catalytic scope of SDR enzymes can be
manipulated, which is in line with the results by Lygidakis et al.
concerning C = O and enone reduction.
[23]
Moreover, our results
show that the starting activity is not a prerequisite for obtaining
a desired novel functionality, here imine reduction. This
encourages to consider SDRs as scaffolds for generating
enzymes which catalyze challenging transformations that are
not easily amenable by known biocatalysts.
