Synergistic improvement of cinnamylamine 
production by metabolic regulation
Shan Yuan1,2, Chao Xu1, Miaomiao Jin1, Mo Xian1* and Wei Liu1* 
Abstract 
Background Aromatic primary amines (APAs) are key intermediates in the chemical industry with numerous applica-
tions. Efficient and mild biocatalytic synthesis is an excellent complement to traditional chemical synthesis. Our lab 
previously reported a whole-cell catalytic system for the synthesis of APAs catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase 
from Neurospora crassa (ncCAR) and ω-transaminase from Ochrobactrum anthropi (OATA). However, the accumulation 
of toxic intermediates (aromatic aldehydes) during biocatalytic synthesis affected yields of APAs due to metabolic 
imbalance.
Results In this work, the biocatalytic synthesis of APAs (taking cinnamylamine as an example) was metabolically 
regulated by the overexpression or knockout of five native global transcription factors (TFs), the overexpression of 
eight native resistance genes, and optimization of promoters. Transcriptome analysis showed that knockout of the 
TF arcA increased the fluxes of NADPH and ATP in E. coli, while the rate of pyruvate metabolism was accelerated. In 
addition, the genes related to stress and detoxification were upregulated with the overexpression of resistance gene 
marA, which reduced the NADPH level in E. coli. Then, the expression level of soluble OATA increased by promoter 
optimization. Overall, arcA and marA could regulate the catalytic rate of NADPH- dependent ncCAR, while arcA and 
optimized promoter could regulate the catalytic rate of OATA. Lastly, the cinnamylamine yield of the best metaboli-
cally engineered strain S020 was increased to 90% (9 mM, 1.2 g/L), and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde was 
below 0.9 mM. This work reported the highest production of cinnamylamine by biocatalytic synthesis.
Conclusion This regulatory process provides a common strategy for regulating the biocatalytic synthesis of other 
APAs. Being entirely biocatalytic, our one-pot procedure provides considerable advantages in terms of environmental 
and safety impacts over reported chemical methods.

Introduction
APAs are key intermediates in the chemical indus -
try with extensive applications in the manufacture of 
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, polymers, dyes and deter -
gents (Fig.  1) [1 –5]. For example, cinnamylamine can 
be used to synthesize the antifungal agent naftifine for 
the treatment of infections of Tinea, Trichophyton, and 
Epidermophyton species [6 ]. 4-Fluorobenzylamine is 
an intermediate of the analgesic flupirtine [7 ]. 2-Fur -
furylamine can be used to make the powerful diu -
retic furosemide [8 ]. 2,4-Difluorobenzylamine is a key

intermediate of dulutvir, which is a new anti-HIV drug 
under GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) [9 ].
At present, the industrial synthesis method of APAs 
is mainly chemical synthesis [1, 2]. The industrial route 
of APAs mainly uses corresponding nitriles, aldehydes 
and alcohols as raw materials to synthesize APAs. For 
example, cinnamylamine and 3-(aminomethyl)pyridine 
(3-AMP) are synthesized from corresponding nitriles 
[10, 11], and 2-furfurylamine is synthesized from 2-fur -
fural (Fig. S1) [12]. These processes are characterized by 
the use of metal catalysts (Co, Cu, etc.), organic solvents 
(methanol, etc.), or harsh energy-demanding conditions 
(high temperature or pressure) with expensive safety 
measures.
Biocatalytic synthesis takes advantage of multistep 
enzymatic reactions that efficiently convert cheap and 
renewable substrates into value-added chemicals under 
mild reaction conditions [13– 16], and it is emerging 
as an economic and environmentally friendly supple -
ment to traditional chemical approaches. There are 
few reports on biocatalytic synthesis of APAs. Our lab 
previously reported a whole-cell catalytic route for the 
synthesis of APAs (such as cinnamylamine) from car -
boxylic acids (Scheme  1) [17]. APAs was synthesized 
for the first time by using biocatalysts co-expressing 
carboxylic acid reductase from Neurospora crassa  
(ncCAR), ω-transaminase from Ochrobactrum anthropi  
(OATA) and phosphopantetheine transferase from E. 
coli (PPTase, modified ncCAR into holoenzyme [18]) 
in one pot [17]. Some substrates in this route, such as 
benzoic acid and cinnamic acid, can be synthesized de 
novo [19, 20]. Therefore, this route had the benefits of 
low cost and environmentally friendly. However, there 
are some disadvantages in this route. On the one hand, 
the metabolic imbalance of the two enzymes in this 
process could easily lead to the accumulation of toxic 
intermediates (aromatic aldehydes), which was not 
conducive to the continuous production of products. 
On the other hand, the yields of some APAs were still 
low, even with prolonged reaction times.

Metabolic balance of strains often refers to the balance 
of reactions catalyzed by two enzymes. The goal of this 
metabolic balance is that no intermediates are produced. 
The metabolic balance can be regulated by metabolic 
engineering of strains to increase the yield and reduce 
the accumulated intermediates [21, 22]. There are cur -
rently few studies on the metabolic regulation of the bio -
catalytic synthesis of APAs. In this study, the biocatalytic 
synthesis of APAs (taking cinnamylamine as an example) 
was metabolically regulated to improve the yield of APAs. 
After metabolic engineering and optimization of reaction 
conditions, the yield of cinnamylamine and conversion of 
cinnamic acid reached 90 and 100%, respectively, which 
was comparable to chemical methods. Furthermore, as 
demonstrated by transcriptome analysis and proteomic 
approach, the increased yield and conversion was due to 
the increased supply of NADPH and ATP and the balance 
of expression levels of the two enzymes. This metabolic 
regulatory process is theoretically suitable for regulating 
the biocatalytic synthesis of other APAs.
Materials and methods
Materials
Cinnamic acid and other chemicals were obtained from 
Aladdin (Shanghai, China). A DNA gel extraction kit, 
plasmid purification kit, Primer STAR Max and DNA 
marker were obtained from TAKARA (Japan). Protein 
markers, restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase 
were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). M9 
Minimal Salts (M9 buffer) were obtained from Sangon 
Biotech (Shanghai, China). E. coli RARE(DE3) was pur -
chased from Addgene (USA).
Construction of plasmids and strains
The plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in 
Table 1.
The heterologous genes used in this study have been 
codon-optimized prior to in  vivo expression in E. coli. 
The recombinant plasmids, pET28a-nccar-pptase and 
pACYCDuet1-oata, were constructed in previous report 
[17]. The Gene ID of these regulatory factors and resist -
ance genes used in this study are as follows: arcA: 948874; 
cra: 944804; crp: 947867; csrA : 947176; fnr : 945908; 
marA: 947613; rob : 948916; soxS: 948567; emrE: 948442; 
emrB: 947167; tolC: 947521; rpoS: 947210; csgD : 949119. 
These genes were synthesized by the Beijing Genomics 
Institute (Beijing, China). The synthesized genes were 
digested with Nde I and BglII, and the digested frag -
ment was ligated into the pACYCDuet1-oata, which was 
digested with the same restriction enzymes. The  P1, 6 and 
 P2, 51 promoter were synthesized by the Beijing Genomics 
Institute (Table S1). The T7 promoter and lac operator of 
oata were replaced by synthesized  P1,6 or  P2,51 to obtain 
p016 and p017. The constructed vector was transformed 
into E. coli RARE (DE3), reported by Aditya M. Kunjapur 
et  al., which has knocked out dkgB (Gene ID: 944901), 
yeaE (Gene ID: 946302), dkgA (Gene ID: 947495), yqhC 
(Gene ID: 947491), yqhD (Gene ID: 947493), yjgB (Gene 
ID: 948802) and yahK (Gene ID: 944975) [23]. Single 
knockout strains (ΔarcA) were obtained from the Keio 
collection, which was derived from E. coli K-12 BW25113 
[24, 25].
Culture of strains
E. coli cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in 5 mL of 
LB medium containing 50 μg/mL Kan and 34 μg/mL 
Cm. The grown cells (2 mL) were then transferred into 
200 mL of LB medium containing appropriate antibiot -
ics and cultivated at 37 °C in the thermostatic incubator 
(ZHICHENG ZWYR-D2403, China). When  OD600 nm  
reached 0.6, 0.2 mM IPTG (isopropyl beta-D-1-thioga -
lactopyranoside) was added. The cells were harvested 
after 15 h by centrifugation (Himac CR21N, Japan) at 
5000 rpm for 5 min. Collected cells were immediately 
used for whole-cell catalysis, or frozen at − 80 °C for tran-
scriptome analysis.
Whole‑cell bioconversion
The cells were washed with M9 buffer (15.12 g/L 
 Na2HPO4·12H2O, 3 g/L  KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl and 1 g/L 
 NH4Cl, pH 7.0) to remove residual culture media and 
further resuspended in M9 buffer. The typical assay to 
directly measure reaction products was performed as fol -
lows: wet whole cells  (OD600 nm  = 30), 10 mM cinnamic 
acid, 20 mM L-alanine (L-Ala) and 20 mM  MgSO4. Our 
previous studies have demonstrated that the by-product 
(pyruvate) produced during the reaction can act as a 
carbon source, thus eliminating the need for additional

glucose [17]. Reactions were performed in M9 buffer 
(pH 7.0) at 37 °C with persistent stirring at 200 rpm. After 
centrifugation, the supernatants were analyzed by HPLC. 
A 500 mM cinnamic acid solution (dissolved in DMSO) 
was diluted 100-fold, and then the initial niacin concen -
tration was tested by HPLC. The yield, conversion, selec -
tivity and productivity were calculated. The calculation

Protein expression and SDS‑PAGE analysis
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (Himac 
CR21N, Japan) at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with 
20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). After the cells were dis -
rupted by a high-pressure cell cracker (Constant systems 
One shot 40KPSI, England), the cell debris was discarded 
by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Sodium 
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE, 12%) was used to assess the protein expression.
HPLC analysis
HPLC analyses were performed on the HPLC system 
(ThermoFisher UltiMate 3000, USA). For cinnamyla -
mine, cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic alco-
hol, HPLC conditions were as follows: a ZORABX-C18 
column (Agilent, USA) was used with a mobile phase 
of  H2O containing 0.1% TFA (phase A) and acetonitrile 
containing 0.1% TFA (phase B); isocratic elution (1:1) was 
performed for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a 
column temperature of 30 °C.
Transcriptome analysis
Samples were subjected to transcriptome analysis by 
a testing company. Strains S003 (wild type strain, WT), 
S009 and S010 were selected for transcriptome sequenc -
ing using IlluminaHiSeq platform, and the quality of 
the raw data (reads) was evaluated. The percentage of 
Q30 bases in each sample was ≥92.02%, and the GC 
content was 49.94% ~ 51.46%. This indicates that the 
sequencing quality and data reliability were high. The 
|log2(foldchange)| ≥1 and P-value < 0.05 were assigned as 
differentially expressed.
Functional annotation of differentially expressed reads 
was performed by searching the Gene Ontology (GO) 
Consortium and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) databases. Enrichment analysis of dif -
ferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed in 
the GO database. KEGG was used for statistical enrich -
ment of DEGs in KEGG pathways. Specific methods for 
transcriptome analysis are presented in “Supplementary 
methods for transcriptome analysis” in “Supplementary 
Information” .
Results and discussion
Effects of global transcription factors on the biocatalytic 
synthesis of cinnamylamine
In this study, five native global transcription factors (TFs) 
involved in carbon metabolism were overexpressed, 
including four DNA-binding transcriptional dual regula -
tors arcA, cra, crp and fnr , and one carbon storage regu -
lator csrA. The five TFs were overexpressed in strain S003 
(WT), respectively, to obtain strains S004-S008. The titer 
of cinnamylamine in strains S003-S008 was detected by 
HPLC. The results showed that the overexpression of cra, 
crp, csrA and fnr had little effect on the production of cin-
namylamine and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde. 
However, overexpression of arcA significantly reduced 
the yield of cinnamylamine by 37% (Fig. 2, Table 2). Thus, 
the arcA of S003 was knocked out to obtain S009. The 
results showed that knocking out arcA increased the 
yield (and productivity) of cinnamylamine, which was 2.1 
times that of S003 (Fig.  2, Table  2). Although the accu -
mulation of cinnamaldehyde also increased, the selectiv -
ity increased. According to our previous report, knocking 
out arcA increased the yield of 3-AMP , however, the rea-
son was not analyzed experimentally [17].
The reason that knockout of arcA resulted in increased 
cinnamylamine production was analyzed by transcrip -
tome analysis. ArcA is a global regulator that regulates 
multiple metabolic pathways [26], so there are many 
genes that are affected. A total of 1266 genes were dif -
ferentially expressed (|log 2 fold change| > 1 and P-value 
< 0.05) between S003 and S009, of which 676 were upreg-
ulated (Fig. S2). The KEGG annotation results of the 
DEGs were classified according to KEGG pathway type, 
with a total of 6 categories. The classification chart is 
shown in Fig.  3, which shows that the proportion of car -
bohydrate metabolism was the highest in the metabolic 
category. ArcA is one of the major regulators of the E. 
coli respiratory pathway in response to redox conditions, 
and the main targets of arcA are genes involved in cen -
tral carbon metabolism [26], which is consistent with 
the results of transcriptome analysis. The only carbon 
source in the reaction system is the by-product, pyruvate. 
According to our previous report, pyruvate can replace 
glucose to provide carbon source for the reaction [17]. 
Therefore, knocking out arcA will regulate metabolic 
pathways involving pyruvate.
To better understand the molecular mechanisms in 
arcA, functional enrichment analysis was performed 
on the DEGs. The results of enrichment analysis of the 
KEGG pathways of DEGs are shown in Fig.  4. DEGs are 
mainly enriched in 3 pathways, including TCA cycle, oxi-
dative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism. The 
vast majority of DEGs of the 3 pathways are significantly 
upregulated genes (Figs. S3, S4 and S5).
Page 6 of 14Yuan et al. Journal of Biological Engineering           (2023) 17:14 
TCA cycle is the main pathway for supplying NAD(P)
H and ATP , so the upregulation of this pathway increases 
the flux of NAD(P)H and ATP in S009. Specifically, genes 
that generated NAD(P)H and ATP in the TCA cycle 
(such as pyruvate dehydrogenase gene, NAD(P)-isoci -
trate dehydrogenase gene, succinate dehydrogenase gene, 
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene) were upregu -
lated  (log2 fold change = 1, 2.6, 2.5, 3.5, respectively) in 
S009 compared to S003 (Fig. S3). The expression level of 
soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase gene (sth), 
which catalyzed NADH and  NADP+ to generate NADPH 
and  NAD+, was also increased by 2-fold in S009. The up-
regulation of these genes is beneficial to the supply of 
NAD(P)H and ATP in S009. Previous reports have shown 
that knockout of the arcA activated the transcription 
levels of the TCA cycle genes and increased the NADH/
NAD+ ratio and ATP production rate [26, 27]. Therefore, 
knockout of arcA accelerated the supply of NAD(P)H and 
ATP in line with these reports.
Oxidative phosphorylation is the process of releas -
ing energy when the substance is oxidized and supply -
ing the energy to ADP to synthesize ATP . Therefore, the 
upregulation of this pathway accelerated the synthesis of 
ATP in S009. Specifically, the cytochrome bo gene (cyo ) 
and NADH dehydrogenase-I gene (nuo ) used to drive 
ATP synthesis in this pathway were upregulated  (log2 fold 
change = 1.5, 2, respectively) (Fig. S4), which favored ATP 
synthesis and accelerated ncCAR-catalyzed reaction.
Upregulation for the pyruvate metabolic pathway 
accelerated the metabolism of the by-product pyruvate 
(Fig. S5). OATA is a reversible ω-transaminase, and the 
accelerated metabolism of pyruvate promotes the synthe-
sis of cinnamylamine.
In a word, the upregulation of 3 pathways is also ben -
eficial for the bioconversion of cinnamyl acid to cinna -
mylamine. Therefore, transcriptome analysis is a good 
explanation for the reason why arcA accelerates the yield 
of cinnamylamine. Previous reports showed that the 
knockout of arcA increased the production of poly(3-
hydroxyalkanoate) [28], phloroglucinol [29], and ethylene 
glycol [30] by 64-fold, 2-fold, and 54%, respectively. The 
biosynthesis of these compounds requires consumption 
of NAD(P)H or ATP . Therefore, knockout of arcA may 
promote the synthesis of compounds that require deple -
tion of NAD(P)H and ATP .
Effects of resistance genes on the biocatalytic synthesis 
of cinnamylamine
The intermediate cinnamaldehyde have been proved to 
be toxic to E. coli [19], which inhibits the activity of S009. 
Therefore, we intend to address this issue by reducing 
Fig. 2 Effects of five global TFs on the conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamylamine. The reaction was performed in M9 buffer (pH 7.0) containing 
10 mM cinnamic acid (the initial concentration); 20 mM L-Ala; 20 mM  MgSO4; S003-S009 wet cells,  OD600 nm = 30 at 30 °C with 200 rpm shaking for 
1 h. Not recovered: undetectable cinnamic acid. It may be converted to other unknown byproducts. According to our previous report [17], the 
by-product pyruvate generated during the reaction can replace glucose as the carbon source for the reaction (Scheme 1)

aldehyde accumulation or increasing cellular resistance 
to aldehydes.
Eight native resistance genes included three local regu -
lators and five multidrug resistance transporters (MDTs). 
The native local regulators of RARE(DE3), such as marA, 
rob, and soxS, can regulate the transcription of various 
antibiotic and superoxide resistance genes to promote the 
conversion of toxic substances into non-toxic substances. 
Three genes were overexpressed in strain S003 to obtain 
S010-S012. In addition, bacterial multidrug resistance 
transporters (MDTs) are responsible for the extracellu -
lar transporting of toxic substrates from inside the cells 
to increase cellular resistance to these substances [31]. 
Then, native MDTs csgD, emrE, emrB, rpoS and tolC were 
overexpressed in S003 to obtain S013-S017, respectively.
Although the yield of cinnamylamine did not increase 
after overexpression of MarA and SoxS, the accumula -
tion of intermediate cinnamaldehyde decreased to 45 and 
55% of that of WT, which will reduce the toxicity of cin -
namaldehyde to cells (Fig. 5, Table 3). The overexpression 
of EmrB (S015) resulted in decreased concentrations of 
cinnamaldehyde and cinnamylamine, which was unfa -
vorable. Effects of overexpression of other genes was not 
obvious.
The reason that overexpression of marA resulted in 
decreased accumulation of cinnamaldehyde was ana -
lyzed by transcriptome analysis. MarA, a local regu -
lator, regulates several multidrug resistance genes, 
so there are not many genes affected. A total of 41 
genes were differentially expressed in S003 and S010, 
of which 33 were upregulated (Fig. S6 ). DEG analy -
sis showed that overexpression of marA resulted in 
upregulation of genes related to stress, detoxification, 
and antioxidant effects, such as NAD(P)H nitroreduc -
tase gene (nfnB/ nfsA), luciferase-like monooxygenase 
gene (yhbW), NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase gene 
(mdaB), superoxide dismutase gene (Mn) (sod2) and 
aconitate hydratase gene (acnA) in S010 (Table  4), 
compared with S003. The Ecocyc database (https://  
ecocyc. org/) shows that marA can activate the

transcription of detoxification or stress genes such as 
nfnB/nfsA, which is consistent with the experimen -
tal results. Many enzymes(such as nfnB/nfsA, mdaB) 
involved in oxidative stress responses have been 
reported to reduce the intracellular NADPH level in E. 
coli, which lowers the reducing power of the cells [32]. 
Therefore, the NADPH level in S010 cells is reduced 
compared with S003, which is responsible for the 
lower conversion of cinnamic acid to cinnamaldehyde. 
As a result, the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde was 
reduced. However, because cinnamaldehyde remained 
(0.4 mM) (Fig.  5), it did not affect the conversion of 
cinnamaldehyde to cinnamylamine (similar yield and 
productivity).
Knockout of arcA increased NADPH levels, whereas 
overexpression of marA resulted in decreased NADPH 
levels. Therefore, in theory, the effects of knocking out 
arcA and overexpressing marA are opposite, and the 
results of the combination of knocking out arcA and 
overexpressing marA need to be tested.
Effects of promoters on the biocatalytic synthesis 
of cinnamylamine
The functional imbalance between ncCAR and OATA 
can lead to the accumulation of intermediates. In addi -
tion, high expression levels of enzymes may impose a 
burden on bacterial metabolism. Therefore, the purpose 
of this experiment is to optimize the promoters of the 
two enzymes to regulate the expression levels of the two 
enzymes and promote the functional balance of the two 
enzymes.
The intermediate cinnamaldehyde was accumulated in 
the whole-cell catalytic system, which indicated that the 
reaction catalyzed by OATA was a rate-limiting. The pro-
moter T7  (PT7) of OATA belongs to the strong promoter, 
and theoretically, OATA has the high expression level. 
However, according to previous studies, a strong pro -
moter is not necessarily required to express high levels 
of soluble protein [33]. Therefore, the  PT7 of OATA was 
replaced with two weaker constitutive promoters  P1,6 and 
 P2,51 (Table S1).  P1,6 and  P2,51 are enhancing mutations of 
wild-type  Plac, and the transcription intensity of  P1,6 is 4 
times that of  P2,51 and 50 times that of  Plac.
The promoter of OATA was replaced with  P1,6 and  P2,51 
to obtain S018 and S019. Subsequently, the titers of cin -
namylamine and cinnamylaldehyde of S003, S018 and 
S019 were detected. The results showed that compared 
with S003, the yield and productivity of cinnamylamine 
in S018 was increased by 80 and 43%, respectively. The 
yield of cinnamylamine in S019 was decreased (Fig.  6, 
Table 5).
Whether the expression of soluble OATA increased 
after  PT7 was replaced by  P1,6 was analyzed by SDS-
PAGE. The software Image Lab was used to analyze the 
expression level of soluble OATA. The content of OATA 
induced by  PT7 accounted for 20.6% of the three tar -
get enzymes (ncCAR, OATA and PPTase), whereas the

content of OATA induced by  P1,6 accounted for 40.2% 
(Fig.  7). Therefore,  P1,6-induced OATA is beneficial to 
increase the yield and productivity of cinnamylamine.
Effect of combined positive factors on the biocatalytic 
synthesis of cinnamylamine
The three positive factors screened above—knockout of 
arcA, overexpression of marA or replacement of  PT7 with 
 P1,6 in OATA, were combined to obtain S020-S022. The 
titers of cinnamylamine and cinnamaldehyde in S003, 
S009, S020, S021 and S022 were detected. The yield and 
productivity of cinnamylamine in S020 were the highest, 
which were 2.5 times and 2.4 times that of WT, respec -
tively (Fig. 8). Although the accumulation of cinnamalde-
hyde increased by 54%, the selectivity of cinnamylamine 
increased overall. The yield of cinnamylamine in S021 
increased by 15%, and the accumulation of cinnamalde -
hyde decreased by 76%. The yield of cinnamylamine in 
S022 remained unchanged, and the accumulation of cin -
namaldehyde decreased by 94% (Table 6).
Compared with S020, the titers of cinnamylamine and 
cinnamylaldehyde were reduced in S022. This result indi-
cated that the low NADPH level caused by overexpression 
of marA overshadowed the high NADPH level caused by 
the knockout of arcA, resulting in reduced accumulation 
of cinnamaldehyde and no residue, which resulted in a

decrease in the titer of cinnamylamine as well. The titers 
of cinnamylamine and cinnamylaldehyde in S021 were 
lower than those of S009 for the same reason.
Optimization of reaction conditions
The strain S020 with the highest yield was obtained 
by metabolic regulation. In the next step, the yield 
and conversion are improved by optimization of the 
reaction conditions. Firstly, the reaction time is opti -
mized. The yield of cinnamylamine and the conversion 
of cinnamic acid under different reaction times were 
detected. The results showed that the titer and yield of 
cinnamylamine in S020 reached the highest (6.4 mM, 
64%) after 2 h (Fig.  9, Table  7). Thereafter, the yield of 
cinnamylamine decreased and the accumulation of cin -
namaldehyde increased. There are two possible reasons: 
1) The low solubility of cinnamylamine in water is not 
conducive to the conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cin -
namylamine. It is necessary to increase the content of 
co-solvent DMSO in the system. 2) OATA is a revers -
ible enzyme, and the co-substrate L-Ala will promote

the reaction to proceed in the forward direction [34]. It 
is necessary to increase the L-Ala content in the system.
Next, the effect of DMSO content in the system on 
the yield and conversion was examined. The four sys -
tems contained 0, 5, 10, and 15% DMSO, respectively. 
The yield of cinnamylamine and the conversion of 
cinnamic acid in the four systems were detected. The 
results showed that the highest yield and conversion 
were achieved in the system containing 10% DMSO, 
which were 83.6 and 99.8%, respectively (Fig. S7  and 
Table S2). Then, the effect of L-Ala content on the yield 
and conversion was detected. Different concentra -
tions of L-Ala (0, 10, 20 mM L-Ala) were added after 
2 h. The yield of cinnamylamine and the conversion of 
cinnamic acid reached the highest after the addition of 
10 mM L-Ala (Fig. S8 and Table S3).
Finally, the yields and conversions of the S003 and the 
S020 were compared. Before metabolic engineering, the 
yield of cinnamylamine and the conversion of cinnamic 
acid were very low (37 and 39%) after 4 h. After metabolic 
engineering, the yield of cinnamylamine was 2.5 times 
that of WT, and the conversion of cinnamic acid was 
80%. However, there were still two problems, one was the 
accumulation of cinnamaldehyde (1.5 mM), and the other 
was that the yield and conversion no longer increase 
after 2 h. After optimization of the reaction conditions, 
the yield and conversion reached 90 and 100% after 3 h, 
respectively, and the accumulation of cinnamaldehyde 
was less than 0.9 mM. The productivity of cinnamylamine 
reached 0.4 g/L/h (Fig. 10, Table 8), and the production of 
cinnamylamine reached 1.2 g/L (9 mM). There were only 
two reports on the biosynthesis of cinnamylamine from 
cinnamic acid. One report from our lab reported that 
the production of cinnamylamine by whole-cell catalysis 
reached 4.2 mM (559 mg/L) [17]. Another report on the 
biosynthesis of cinnamylamine reported that the produc -
tion of cinnamylamine by shaking flask culture reached 
523 mg/L [35]. Therefore, 1.2 g/L was the highest produc-
tion of biosynthetic cinnamylamine.
Conclusion
APAs are key intermediates in the chemical industry with 
extensive applications in the manufacture of pharmaceu -
ticals, pesticides, polymers, dyes and detergents. At pre -
sent, the accumulation of toxic intermediates (aldehydes) 
during biosynthesis affects yields of APAs due to meta -
bolic imbalance.
In this work, the biocatalytic synthesis of APAs (tak -
ing cinnamylamine as an example) was metabolically

regulated by the overexpression or knockout of five 
native global TFs, eight native resistance genes and opti -
mization of promoters. The global TF arcA was knocked 
out and the  PT7 of OATA was replaced by  P1,6 in the opti-
mized metabolically engineered strain S020. The yield of 
S020 was 2.5 times that of S003 (WT). After optimization 
of the reaction conditions, the yield of cinnamylamine 
and the conversion of cinnamic acid in S020 reached 90 
and 100%, respectively, and the accumulation of cinna -
maldehyde was less than 0.9 mM. Finally, the bottleneck 
of low yield of cinnamylamine and high accumulation of 
cinnamaldehyde was solved.
In addition, the reasons for the increased yield of cin -
namylamine and the decreased accumulation of cinna -
maldehyde in S020 were analyzed. The results show that 
knocking out arcA can increase the intracellular levels of 
NADPH and ATP and accelerate the metabolism of the 
by-product pyruvate, which is beneficial for the conver -
sion of cinnamic acid to cinnamylamine. After the  PT7 of 
OATA was replaced by  P1,6, the expression level of OATA 
was significantly increased, which was favorable for the 
conversion of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamylamine.
Previously, our lab has reported that this pathway is 
also suitable for the biosynthesis of other APAs. Since 
the accumulation of NADPH and ATP after the knockout 
of arcA and the improvement of the expression level of 
OATA after the replacement of the promoter belong to 
the changes of the strain itself, this metabolic regulatory 
process is theoretically suitable for regulating the bio -
synthesis of other APAs. In other words, this metabolic 
regulation process provides a common strategy for the 
efficient synthesis of other APAs.
