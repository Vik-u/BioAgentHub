Abstract
Genetic variation accelerates adaptation and resilience and enables the survival of species in their changing environment. Increasing
the genetic diversity of crop species is essential to improve their yield and enhance food security. Synthetic directed evolution (SDE)
employs localized sequence diversification (LSD) of gene sequence and selection pressure to evolve gene variants with better fitness,
improved properties and desired phenotypes. Recently, CRISPR–Cas-dependent and -independent technologies have been applied for
LSD to mediate synthetic evolution in diverse species, including plants. SDE holds excellent promise to discover, accelerate and expand
the range of traits of the value in crop species. Here, we highlight the efficient SDE approaches for the LSD of plant genes, selection
strategies and critical traits for targeted improvement. We discuss the potential of emerging technologies, including CRISPR–Cas base
editing, retron editing, EvolvR and prime editing, to establish efficient SDE in plants. Moreover, we cover CRISPR–Cas-independent
technologies, including T7 polymerase editor for continuous evolution. We highlight the key challenges and potential solutions of
applying SDE technologies to improve the plant traits of the value.
Key words:synthetic directed evolution (SDE); localized sequence diversification (LSD); CRISPR–Cas systems; retrons; prime editing;

Genetic variation has shaped life on earth. Human beings have
modified our crops over more than the past 10 000 years by select-
ing desired and improved traits, resulting in crop domestication
(1). Modern crops have undergone extensive genetic changes when
compared to their wild ancestors. We have also learned that
genetic diversity is the basis for crop improvement and food secu-
rity because it provides a reservoir of largely untapped variation
(2). The 20th century witnessed the development of methods to
induce genetic variation randomly . During the Green Revolution
in the 1960s and 1970s, improved crops generated via random
mutagenesis were vital to increasing yield (3).
Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, methods to precisely modify
the genome were established by developing site-specific nucleases
that facilitate the generation of targeted double-strand breaks
(DSBs) in the genome (4). DSBs are then repaired either imprecisely
via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or precisely by homology-
directed repair (HDR) (5). The repair of such induced DSBs can be
harnessed for various genetic outcomes in a user-defined man-
ner. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) systems have been
implemented in many species to introduce various changes to the
genome, including gene knockouts, gene knock-in or replacement,
base editing and epigenome editing (6).
The power of CRISPR–Cas systems has been exploited to engi-
neer traits of interest, including disease resistance, yield improve-
ment and tolerance to abiotic stress (7). The functional analysis
of genes and genomes has also fueled identifying targets of inter-
est for crop improvement via CRISPR–Cas systems. However,
although to date, CRISPR–Cas systems have largely been imple-
mented to engineer the genome locally (8, 9), induce RNA inter-
ference (10, 11) or detect nucleic acids (12, 13), they can also be
powerful tools to explore, interrogate and unlock the potential of
plant cells.
A typical synthetic directed evolution (SDE) cycle involves gen-
erating a pool of gene variants, screening while applying specific
selective pressure and identifying those gene variants that evoke
the desired phenotype; the resulting variants are then ampli-
fied and subjected to another cycle of SDE (Figure 1). This pro-
cess mimics natural selection but in an accelerated form (14).
Unlike the rational design of biomolecules, which requires a
detailed knowledge of the structure and function of the protein
or biomolecule under consideration, in SDE, you usually ‘get what
you select for,’ with no prior knowledge required.
SDE endows existing biomolecules with new functions, allow-
ing them to accomplish new tasks (15). For example, during the
SDE of an enzyme, the enzyme may initially function poorly on a
new substrate. However, variants are generated through multiple
rounds of sequence diversification and screening until they can
use the new substrate. This emerging technology has gained some
recognition, as Frances Arnold was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry for her work on the directed evolution of enzymes
(16).
1. Developing technologies for SDE
Because of the ease of selection, the SDE of plant genes has been
employed in heterologous hosts, thereby limiting the power of SDE
due to the lack of optimal codon usage, proper folding and the
complexity of the metabolic environment. Only a few successful
cases of SDE have been reported in heterologous hosts (17). There
is a pressing need to establish directed evolution in plants in their
cellular context to harness the power of this approach. The imple-
mentation of a synthetic biology pipeline consisting of the steps
Figure 1.Schematic representation of SDE. Basic SDE involves three key
stages: gene diversification, selection and amplification. Initially , the
target gene of interest can be employed for localized diversification
using several molecular diversification tools. Later, the generated variant
gene pool will be subjected to the iterative selection pressure to enrich
the variants with superior functional qualities. In the final stage, the
functional gene variants can be employed for further continuous gene
diversification to amplify the superior functional characteristics.
(i) design; (ii) build; (iii) test and (iv) learn should allow the
successful application of SDE to plant systems (Figure 2).
Developing methods to generate localized sequence diversifi-
cation (LSD) is the key to SDE applications. SDE has employed
many methods geared toward this goal, including mutagenesis
via error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR shuffling,
recombineering, hypermutator strains or error-prone replication
on an orthogonal plasmid (14). CRISPR-based methods harness
the power of CRISPR–Cas systems to generate localized sequence
variation via NHEJ/HDR (17). Several approaches have been imple-
mented in prokaryotes that support HDR, including multiplexed
oligo-nucleotide-mediated genome editing ( 18). In eukaryotes,
base editors fused to the Cas enzyme can provide a means for
sequence diversification at targeted break sites ( 19, 20). Other
sequence diversification modalities, including EvolvR, retrons
mediated and CRISPR–Cas-independent T7 polymerase-driven
continuous editing (TRACE) system, have been harnessed for
directed evolution applications in different organisms (21–23).
2. SDE in plants
We adapted CRISPR–Cas systems to establish an in planta SDE
platform (24). We selected rice (Oryza sativa) splicing factor 3b
(SF3B1) as our initial target for SDE. SF3B1 is a subunit of the
SF3B spliceosome complex of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleopro-
tein (U2SnRNP) complex. The splicing inhibitor drug herboxidiene
(GEX1A) and pladienolide B (PB) bind to SF3B1 and block splicing.
We reasoned that targeting SF3B1 for SDE might produce variants
resistant to GEX1A and PB. We, therefore, designed, constructed
and delivered a tiled library of sgRNAs covering the entireSF3B1
coding sequence for targeted mutagenesis. BecauseSF3B1 is an
essential gene, all sgRNAs were designed to introduce DSBs and
G.S. Rao et al. 3
Figure 2.SDE for successful application in plants. The synthetic biology pipeline implementation includes the following steps to allow the successful
application of SDE to plant systems. (1) Design, the user has to design thein vivoadaptable SDE tools. This might include the codon optimization of
SDE reagents, identification of target gene and designing of DRT, gRNA/pegRNA libraries and pTarget designing for target gene SDE. (2) Build, the
optimized SDE tools (CRISPR–Cas dependent and independent) need to be cloned into the efficient plant expression binary vectors and construct the
libraries to target the corresponding genes. (3) Test, theAgrobacterium cells harboring the SDE tools will be mobilized into plant tissue via,
Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation or by gene gun. The selection pressure would be implemented to eliminate the undesired plantlets.
(4) Learn, during this stage, the obtained plantlets would be subjected to phenotyping and genotyping. The functional gene variants and evolved
proteins will be detected. For continuous gene diversification or to enrich the functional characteristics in the selected plant, the user can proceed for
several rounds of design-build-test-learn synthetic evolution cycle.
in-frame mutations may retain normal splicing function, with
the hope that one or more gene-editing events would disrupt
the binding site of GEX1A or PB. Accordingly , we recovered sev-
eral mutants, which we termed SGR for SF3B1–GEX1A resistant,
that conferred resistance to GEX1A and carried single or multiple
amino acid deletions or substitutions.
We then conducted a structural analysis of the binding
between GEX1A and the SGR mutants, revealing that these vari-
ants indeed cannot bind GEX1A. The plants harboring these SGR
SF3B1 mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type, suggest-
ing their spliceosome is fully functional. We also treated wild-type
and mutant plants with GEX1A and PB; notably , the SGR mutants
were resistant to PB, thus providing compelling evidence that
these two drugs share the same target site and that their binding
may be similar. Finally , we tested the effects of GEX1A treatment
on splicing in the wild-type and the SGR mutants, which revealed
that the SGR mutants retain close to full splicing activity; one
of the mutants tested, SGR4, appeared completely insensitive to
GEX1A (24). This example illustrates the power of SDE to evolve
variants that remain functional (in this case: splicing) and also
evolve new functions (here, resistance to PB and GEX1A).
Other examples showing the power of directed evolution
were recently reported, using a dual base editor to evolve rice
acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), whose activity is inhibited
by the herbicide haloxyfop, leading to growth retardation. New
ACC variants were generated that conferred resistance to haloxy-
fop by targeting ACC by dual-based editors for continuous C to
T and A to G modifications. Indeed, gene-edited seedlings har-
boring the ACC mutations P1927F and W2125C were resistant to
the herbicide, providing another example of the applicability of
CRISPR systems to synthetic evolution (19). Recently , Kaunget al.
developed enhanced bispyribac sodium herbicide-tolerant rice
germplasm containing the P171F variant of acetolactate synthase
1 (ALS1). In their study , theOsALS1 gene was targeted by nCas9
(D10A)-base editors together with the sgRNA library covering the
full-length coding region (20).
3. Potential SDE tools for LSD in plants
For SDE in plants, effective technologies and approaches will need
to be developed and optimized for LSD, screening, and selec-
tion for every target. CRISPR–Cas-based systems can now be
used to generate LSD in plants (17). Precisely , a library of single-
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) covering a given region of a gene of interest
is introduced into Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) for
CRISPR–Cas-mediated gene editing in the target plant tissue (25).
4 Synthetic Biology,2021, Vol. 6, No. 1
As described before, the sequence variation via CRISPR-induced
NHEJ is possible when targeting an essential gene by SDE since
most mutants will be non-viable (Figure 3A). New CRISPR-based
approaches are emerging for LSD in plants. For example, base
editing generates edits without DSBs and with the larger editing
window size of+50 to −50 relative to PAM sequence (17, 26). There-
fore, the complete sequence of a gene may be subjected to base
editing by combining a library of sgRNAs with CRISPR-base editors
for SDE in plants (Figure 3A).
Other possible approaches may include the HDR-based retron
technology , which brings the repair templates closer to the DSB
site. For example, theE. coliEc86 retron was coupled with CRISPR
and Cas9 to enrich ssDNAs at the targeted locations for DSB
repair via HDR in yeast cells (27). Therefore, this method relied
Figure 3.Potential SDE tools for LSD in plants. Target gene LSD can be achieved by CRISPR–Cas-dependent and -independent SDE tools. (A) Several
CRISPR–Cas-dependent SDE tools, (i) Cas9 protein together with the library of sgRNAs targeting a complete gene can cause NHEJ-mediated LSD,
(ii) Retron editing: Cas9 fusion with Ec86 RT together with the library of retron-DRT -sgRNA targeting the complete gene can produce any N to N
conversions or HDR-mediated LSD, (iii) Base editing: nCas9 (D10A) fused with any base editor together with the library of sgRNAs targeting the
complete gene will generate C:G to T:A or A:T to G:C conversions near the nick regions, (iv) EvolvR: nCas9 (D10A) fused with error-prone DNA
polymerase together with the library of sgRNAs targeting the complete gene can generate random mutations and cause LSD, (v) Prime editing: nCas9
(H840A) and M-MLV RT together with the library of pegRNAs containing the designed mutations can generate any N to N conversions or
HDR-mediated LSD in the target gene. (B) CRISPR–Cas-independent TRACE (T7 polymerase-driven continuous editing) can generate sequence
diversification in the target gene. The fusion of T7 RNA polymerase and AID base editor (pEditor) will diversify the target gene controlling by T7
promoter (pTarget) via C:G to T:A conversions.
G.S. Rao et al. 5
on a library of repair templates fused with sgRNA for local-
ized ssDNA production and targeted HDR to generate diversified
variants in plants (Figure 3A). Another enzyme-based EvolvR tech-
nology uses nCas9 (D10A) with a bacterial error-prone DNA poly-
merase (PolI3M) and thioredoxin-binding domain together with a
target-specific sgRNA to produce continuous LSD in bacteria (23).
nCas9 creates a single-stranded nick, from which the nCas9 cou-
pled error-prone DNA polymerase synthesizes new mutant DNA
strands. Halperinet al.showed enhanced sequence diversification
rates with an editing window of up to+56 to +350 nucleotides
from the nick in prokaryotes (23). The design and employing
library of sgRNAs targeting complete gene by EvolvR technology
can generate various functional gene variants (Figure 3A).
Novel prime editing technology has been successfully used
to incorporate genetic information at the target sites into the
genome, without DSBs. In prime editing, reverse transcriptase is
targeted to nicked DNA, and the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA)
harbors the edited sequence (28). Several groups have reported
low editing efficiency when using prime editors in plants (29, 30).
We recently applied prime editors for the precise engineering of
plant genomes by introducing a single point mutation into the
rice ALS gene that had been shown to confer bispyribac resistance
in rice (30). We recovered mutations harboring the engineered
sequence but with lower efficiency than expected (0.26–2%). We
hope that editing efficiency can be raised to over 10% to allow the
application of prime editors to SDE. It may be possible to design
and construct a pegRNA library to introduce all possible muta-
tions in a specific gene sequence and deliver this library to plant
cells; the regeneration of transgenic plants with a simultaneous
and constant selective pressure may recover superior variants
(Figure 3A). Since the Cas activity istrans, the edited T -DNA-free
plants are transgene free. Conventionally , the CRISPR–Cas-edited
T -DNA-free plants can be selected by the genetic segregation,
back crossing and genotyping methods (3). Therefore, the CRISPR-
dependent SDE tools can develop transgene-free plants with the
superior phenotypes after the T -DNA segregation step.
CRISPR-independent methods exist: as mentioned before the
TRACE, a T7 RNA polymerase fused to activation-induced cyti-
dine deaminase (AID) base editor (pEditor) will bind to the T7
promoter driving the expression of a gene of interest (pTarget)
(21). During transcription, the base editor comes close to the DNA
intended for editing, leading to base editing over an expanded
window of a few hundred base pairs. This system offers a power-
ful approach for continuous directed evolution (Figure 3B). Unlike
CRISPR-dependent tools, the TRACE cannot generate transgene-
free plants. In TRACE system, the target gene with in the T -DNA
is regulated by T7 promoter in acis-regulatory manner. So, the
T -DNA-free plants are always unedited. However, this technique
works best in cell cultures; any testing in whole plants will neces-
sitate engineering the identified edits into the plant genome using
one of the CRISPR-based methods described above.
4. Selection strategies
Following sequence diversification, the selection is a crucial stage
during which the population of variants is selected to recover
variants with strong genotype–phenotype linkage and enable the
isolation of evolved variants with the desired function(s). The
selection of evolved variants is the key to the successful applica-
tion of SDE. Although selection may take many forms, the most
powerful and easiest form of selection is linked to the survival
of the cell or the organism (31). For applications in plants, the
directed evolution of herbicide resistance would constitute one of
the most straightforward applications of SDE.
Other selection criteria may be applicable, such as changes
in color or morphology , yield and resilience to biotic and
abiotic factors, but implementing these would be more time-
consuming. A number of clones will pass through the selection
process, although they do not confer the desired phenotype
(false positives), while other clones with the desired genotype
nevertheless do not survive the selection stage (false nega-
tives). Since there will be a strong linkage between genotype
and phenotype in one population, replication will minimize false
positives.
5. Key traits for improvement
SDE can be used to engineer the key traits of value. Engi-
neering herbicide resistance is a clear goal. For example,
‘5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)’ in rice
can be targeted to improve the resistance to the herbicide
glyphosate. Enhancing crop tolerance against different herbicides
is essential to reduce competition with several weed species.
Other valuable traits that may be subjected to SDE includ-
ing an enhanced photosynthesis rate by diversifying ‘ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)’, abiotic stress
resistance by evolving ‘isoprene synthase’ and ‘pyrabactin
resistance1/pyr1-like4 (PYL4)’, increased plant protection and pro-
ductivity by modifying ‘ascorbate peroxidase’, increased number
of tillers and yield by evolving ‘carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7
(CCD7)’, improved grain yield and immunity against pathogens by
diversifying ‘ideal plant architecture 1 (IPA1)’, and for producing
more superfoods by raising carotene and anthocyanin contents.
Trait improvement by promoter engineering is one of the
important approaches. Promoters are thecis-regulatory noncod-
ing DNA sequences that influence the gene expression levels.
Several recent studies demonstrated the role of promoter editing
in crop improvement and disease resistance (32, 33). Therefore,
the SDE technologies can also be employed for the evolution of
a specific promoter by targeting the promoter at multiple loca-
tions. The evolved promoters can generate beneficial quantitative
variation in the expression of downstream-regulated gene.
6. Conclusion
SDE has revolutionized trait engineering all across a wide commu-
nity , releasing the laborious and time-consuming fitness burdens
from traditional strategies. Whereas limited by the availability
of the efficient SDE tools for LSD, the power of trait engineer-
ing in plants is still underestimated. We summarized potential
SDE tools, selection strategies and essential plant traits that can
be improved via SDE in this viewpoint. We envision that SDE
will unlock the potential of trait engineering to develop superior
crop varieties resilient to climate change with improved yield and
quality to support global food security .
