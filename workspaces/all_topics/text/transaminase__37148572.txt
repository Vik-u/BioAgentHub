ABSTRACT This research aimed to evaluate how
using betaine levels as a choline substitute affects pro-
ductive performance, egg quality parameters, fatty acids
proﬁle, and antioxidant status in laying hens. One hun-
dred and forty brown chickens, 45 wk old, were divided
into 4 groups, each group of 7 replicates with 5 chickens
per replicate. Theﬁrst group of diets with choline has
control (A) 100% choline, the second group (B) 75%
choline + 25% betaine, the third group (C) 50%
choline + 50% betaine, and the fourth group (D)
received 100% betaine. No signi ﬁcant effects were
observed inﬁnal body weight (BW), body weight gain
(BWG), egg production (EW), and feed intake (FI)
for laying hens. In the diet in which betaine was replaced
choline, egg mass (EM) and egg weight (EW) increased
compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Also, after
12 wk of feeding, the egg quality parameters were not
inﬂuenced; however, yolk color was increased signiﬁ-
cantly compared with the control group. Serum total
cholesterol, LDL-lipoprotein, HDL-lipoprotein, triglyc-
eride, glucose, aspartate transaminase (AST), and
alanine transaminase ( ALT) were not affected by
replacing choline with betaine. Furthermore, liver
malondialdehyde (MDA) content, yolk vitamin E, and
fatty acid levels were not signiﬁcantly affected by replac-
ing choline with betaine. Moreover, hens fed betaine dis-
played an increased antibody titer of the Newcastle
disease (ND) virus. EW and EM were increased by
3.50% and 5.43% in 100% betaine group (D) when com-
pared to the control group. Isthmus weight was
decreased by 48.28 % in 50% choline + 50% betaine
group (C) when compared to the control group. ND was
increased by 26.24% in 100% betaine group when com-
pared to the control group. In conclusion, betaine
supplementation positively affected productive perfor-
mance, egg quality measurements, and immunity
response in Bovans brown laying hens.

INTRODUCTION
By optimizing the use of raw materials, reducing pro-
duction costs, and minimizing pollution by nitrogen and
phosphorus caused by the environment, the formulation
of diets that closely meet ideal requirements is a crucial
technique to tackle these issues (Wang et al., 2004; Chen
et al., 2022). The exact amino acid (AA) requirements
vary based on breed, age, feeding procedures, housing
conditions, and the accuracy with which requirements
have been determined. The required intakes of AA and
energy, which are interdependent, have also changed
due to genetic developments and improved laying hen
performance (Liu and Selle et al., 2017; Arif et al.,
2022). Adding lysine and choline to the diet of laying
hens may enhance the health of the immune system and
digestive tract (Kidd, 2004; Vaezi et al., 2011; Abd El-
Ghany and Babazadeh 2022). Additionally, it has been
demonstrated that laying hens ’ egg production, egg

weight, egg mass, and feed conversion efﬁciency can all
be improved by increasing dietary lysine (Faria et al.,
2002; Kakhki et al., 2016). Due to their low availability
in protein sources of plant origin, methionine, cysteine,
and choline, which are generally known as the total sul-
fur-containing AA, are theﬁrst limiting AA in experi-
mental poultry diets (Kakhki et al., 2016). Since it is
needed for cell metabolism as a methyl donor, methio-
nine contributes to synthesize coenzymes and precursors
of cysteine, methionine and choline and receives more
attention than cysteine in birds ( Bunchasak, 2009;
Saeed et al., 2017). For feathering, high levels of methio-
nine-1-cysteine are required for protein synthesis (Fisher
et al., 1981). Additionally, the high levels of total sulfur-
containing AA were required for increasing egg mass
and feed conversion ratio ( FCR)( Narv/C19aez-Solarte
et al., 2005). Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and the
2 main phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine [PC] and
sphingomyelin) occurring in membranes include choline
as a source of labile methyl groups (Zeisel and Blusztajn,
1994). Moreover, B vitamins has choline for forming PC,
the main ingredient of very low-density lipoprotein and
the principal phosphorus-containing lipid recently found
in laying hen liver, blood, and eggs suggesting that cho-
line is an essential nutrient in laying hen diets (Ridgway
and Vance, 1992; Zeisel and Blusztajn, 1994).
Previous research found that choline supplementation
reduced the total lipids in the liver of laying hens (Saeed
et al., 2017). Furthermore, adding more choline to the
diet seems to reduce the risk of producing fatty liver and
beneﬁt laying hens with fatty liver hemorrhagic syn-
drome (Wolford and Polin, 1975). Although Daghir
et al. (1960)reported that choline did not signiﬁcantly
affect laying hens’ egg yolk and serum cholesterol levels,
Tsiagbe et al. (1988)observed that adding choline with
500 or 1000 mg/kg caused signi ﬁcant increases in
the concentration of PC and total phospholipids in
egg yolks.
Betaine (N, N, N-trimethylglycine) is a nontoxic
amino acid derivative used by various plants and organ-
isms to provide methyl groups for the synthesis of sev-
eral substances, including methionine, carnitine, and
creatine (Arif et al., 2022 ). Betaine use thus may
improve poultry tolerance to heat stress (Attia et al.,
2016). According to some studies, betaine has osmopro-
tective properties that could protect proteins and
enzymes in intestinal cells from environmental stress
prevent dehydration and increase body retention and
are vital for reducing body temperature in heat-stressed
chickens (Zulkiﬂi et al., 2004; Lan and Kim, 2018).
Moreover, Liu et al. (2019)demonstrated that dietary
supplementation of betaine at 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2%
reduced the adverse effects of heat stress on average
daily feed intake and body weight (BW) in broilers.
Betaine is known to promote the growth and survival of
gut microbes (Eklund et al., 2005; Ratriyanto et al.,
2017). Furthermore,Hamidi et al. (2010)reported that
adding 0.12% betaine to the feed signiﬁcantly increased
the gain of mixed-infected coccidia, which may increase
the protective effect retained in the epithelial cells,
intestinal tract, and mucosa (Attia et al., 2016; Park
and Kim, 2017).
Adding 0.10% betaine to poultry feed improves pro-
tein and yolk weight in a Haugh unit (Ezzat et al., 2011;
Attia et al., 2016). Based on available research, there is
limited evidence for using betaine and choline in organic
diets. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the
effects of betaine and/or choline supplementation on
performance, egg quality, blood, antioxidant status,
lipid peroxidation, and reproductive qualities of laying
hens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
One hundred and forty Bovans brown chickens, 45 wk
old, 25 wk of production, with eggs production 76%,
were housed in individual cages on a 16-h: 8-h light/
dark cycle. The chickens were randomly assigned to 4
groups (7 replicates of 5 chickens each, each chicken was
housed individually). The cage is Big Dutchman in regu-
lar dimensions of 40£ 35 £ 60 cm
3, double-sided battery
cage. An automated nipple drinker was given for each
cage. The ﬁrst group (control, A) was supplemented
with a basal diet: 500g/ton choline; the second (B):
375g/ton choline +125g/ton betaine; the third group
(C): 250g/ton choline + 250g/ton betaine; the fourth
group: 500g/ton betaine (D). The primary feed composi-
tion is prepared according to the recommendations of
(NRC, 1994), which are presented inTable 1.
Laying Growth Performance
Hens were weighed at 45 and 57 wk of age, whereas
feed intake was recorded weekly and expressed on a cage
basis. Eggs were collected and weighed daily, and the

average value of eggs during the experimental period
was used to determine egg production (percentage hen-
day) and egg weight. Egg mass was calculated by multi-
plying egg production by egg weight. The overall FCR
was estimated on a cage basis as g feed/g egg.
Egg Quality
Assessment of egg and shell feature parameters
including yolk color, egg weight, shell weight, shell thick-
ening, yolk width, yolk height, yolk weight, albumin
weight, albumin height, and albumin width was per-
formed at 45 and 57 wk. For this, 40 eggs/ group placed
between 08:00 am and 12:00 pm were randomly selected,
weighed, and prepared for evaluation. Evaluation of yel-
low color was performed with Roche yellow color fan
method (Vitamins and Chemicals 1988). The weight of
the shell is calculated as follows: any protein present in
the shell was washed, then dried, and weighed to the
weight of the whole egg. The egg was marked with a spe-
ciﬁc method for each egg based on the measured weight
of the egg.
Assessment of Reproductive Morphology
At the end of the experimental period (57 wk), 10
hens from each group were randomly selected,
weighed, anesthetized and euthanized by decapitation.
The reproductive system weight and morphology were
also recorded. The oviducts were isolated and weighed
and the total length of oviduct was measured. The rel-
ative mass and the lengths of the vagina, uterus, isth-
mus, magnum, and infund ibulum were estimated.
Liver samples were dissected and stored at -20°C for
farther analysis.
Blood Parameters Examination
At the end of the trial, blood samples were obtained in
heparinized tubes from the wing vein and centrifuged at
3000 £ g for 20 min to get plasma samples, kept at -20 °
C until analysis. Plasma concentrations of total lipid,
total cholesterol, triglyceride, high and low-density lipo-
proteins (HDL-lipoprotein and LDL-lipoprotein), albu-
min, total protein, and glucose levels were analyzed
using a colorimetric kit (Egyptian Company for Biotech-
nology, Cairo, Egypt, and Wako Chemicals, VA). The
content of liver malondialdehyde (MDA) was deter-
mined utilizing a commercial colorimetric kit (Liqui-
zyme MDA; Biotechnology, Egypt). The absorbance
was monitored using a spectrophotometer (Unico UV
2000; Spectra Lab Scientiﬁc Inc., Markham, Ontario,
Canada) at a wavelength of 545 nm. Regarding antibody
titre, hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were
measured using U-bottom microtiter plates according to
Beard et al. (1975).
Egg Yolk Fatty Acids Proﬁle
At the end of the experiment, 70 eggs were collected
per group to measure the yolk fatty acid proﬁle in egg
yolk, including linolenic, oleic, palmitic acid by the use
of Shimadzu GC-4 CM gas chromatograph (PFE), out-
ﬁtted with aﬂame ionization detector. Calcium concen-
tration was measured by ﬂame atomic absorption
spectrophotometer. The total concentration of vitamin
E and cholesterol in egg yolk were determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography as described by
Catoni, (2008).
Data Analysis
The differences between the treatment and control
groups were analyzed with a General Liner model using
SPSS (Version 17.0). One-way ANOVA was applied to
determine the effects of choline and/or betaine when
birds were the statistical units for performance parame-
ters, organ weights, and samples for biochemical and
other parameters. Duncan’s new multiple-range tests
were used to identify which treatment conditions were
signiﬁcantly different from each other at a signiﬁcance
level ofP < 0.05.

weight and mass were increased signiﬁcantly in all the
treatment groups compared with the control group. No
mortality occurred during the experiment.
Egg Euality Parameters
Table 3 presents the egg quality data at 45 wk and
the end of the trial. In the initial study period (45
wk), no signiﬁcant changes in egg quality characteris-
tics were recorded. Betainesupplementation in laying
hens’ diets increased egg weights, yolk color score,
and albumin width at 57 wk, whereas the group
received 500g/ton betaine had the highest values for
the egg weights, yolk color score, and albumin width.
On the other hand, choline and/or betaine dietary
supplementation did not signi ﬁcantly affect shape
index, yolk width, yolk height, albumin height, shell
thickness, and Haugh units through the experimental
period of laying hens.
Reproductive Organ Morphology
Measurements
Results for the effects of betaine and/or choline sup-
plements on reproductive organ weights and lengths
are presented in Table 4. The diet of choline and/or
betaine had a signiﬁcant effect in the oviduct weights,
where the highest weight was in the control treatment
(500g/ton choline) and (250 g/ton choline with
250g/ton betaine). The weight of the ovary, vagina,
uterus, isthmus, magnum, and infundibulum were not
affected. However, supplementation with choline and/
or betaine did not affect the oviduct length compared
to the control (P < 0.05).
Blood Measurement and Antibody Titer
As shown in Table 5, the administration of dietary
choline and/or betaine did not signiﬁcantly change the
plasma parameters of AST, ALT albumin, total protein,
globulin, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. In
addition, chickens fed betaine showed higher antibody
titers against the Newcastle disease (ND) virus.
Chemical Characteristics of Egg Yolk and
Liver
Table 6shows the effect of choline and/or betaine sup-
plementation on the fatty acid proﬁle of eggs. Choline
and/or betaine had no signiﬁcant impact on the chemi-
cal fatty acid concentration in the egg yolk.Figure 1
presents the results of effect of choline and/or betaine
supplementation on liver MDA content, yolk total cho-
lesterol and vitamin E in laying hens, yolk total choles-
terol was not inﬂuenced whereas yolk vitamin E and
liver MDA content were decreased signi ﬁcantly by
replacing choline to betaine groups.
DISCUSSION
There are many studies on the importance of using
betaine and choline as feed additives to improve broiler
and laying hens’ immune status and productivity. In
this study, the betaine and choline diet increased egg
production and mass at 57 wk of age (p< 0.05, Table 2).

regarding choline and/or betaine and their potential
effects on laying productive performance.
Although Omer et al. (2020)noted that supplement-
ing with 0.5% betaine had no effect on the BW change
and egg weight (EW) of laying hens. Egg production
(EP) rate and egg mass (EM) were signiﬁcantly (P <
0.01) improved in hens fed the diet supplemented with
levels of betaine diet as compared to control groups
(Table 2). Feed conversion can be improved due to
betaine’s ability to act as l-methionine donor and its
many physiological properties that improve the intesti-
nal environment and thus increase absorption (Remus
and Quarles, 2000).
The accumulation of betaine in the cell protects it
from osmotic stress and allows normal metabolic func-
tion under conditions where the cell is usually inactive
(Saunderson and MacKinlay, 1990). These results were
similar to those of (Ryuet et al., 2002). Furthermore,
compared to the control group, adding betaine to laying
hen diets at levels of 5.00 and 2.00 ppm signiﬁcantly
increased EP, EM, and FCR.
Gudev et al. (2011)showed that adding betaine to a
laying diet of up to 1.5 g/kg for hens in heat stress signif-
icantly increased egg production and egg mass (P <
0.05). The increased secretion of blood insulin-like
growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) may have
improved laying performance by increasing the half-life
of blood insulin-like growth factor I and improved pres-
ervation productivity and liver tissue differentiation
(Park and Kim, 2017). Moreover, betaine could reduce
the requirement for additional methyl group donors
such as methionine and choline. Also, it increases the liv-
er’s ability to synthesize proteins and fatty acids. These
results were in agreement with those obtained byPark
and Kim (2017), who reported that betaine supplement
to laying hen diets up to 1.2 g/ kg did not signiﬁcantly
improve egg production compared to the control group.
FCR improved when betaine was included in the diet of
layer chickens (Eklund et al., 2005) and egg production
(Zou et al., 1998). Betaine improved the productivity
and laying parameters of hens under heat stress. For
instance, adding 0.2% betaine to the diet increased egg

BETAINE IN LAYING HEN DIETS 5
production and eggshell quality in heat-stressed chickens
(Ryu et al., 2002).
In heat-stressed birds, supplementing other dietary
nutrients with betaine improved laying features. For
instance, Fayoumi laying hens fed in hot conditions sig-
niﬁcantly improved after consuming betaine, folic acid,
and choline supplements (Tolba et al., 2007). Egg per-
formance, laying performance, and health of layer chick-
ens under heat stress were increased after vaccination
with 400 mg/kg betaine (Hao et al., 2017). When beta-
ine is added to the chickens’ diet, the serum increases
several hormones, including lutein, estradiol, triiodothy-
ronine, thyroxine, progesterone, and follicle hormone
(Zou et al., 1998).
Betaine also increases melatonin concentrations,
serum estradiol and daily egg mass in chickens, which
increases egg production (Zou et al., 1998). Betaine sup-
plementation of 0.10 to 0.21% increases the digestibility
of the ether extract by 9.4% in laying hens and quail
(Ezzat et al., 2011; Ratriyanto et al., 2018). Rørvik et al.
(2000) showed that increased bile acid excretion was
associated with better digestibility of ether extracts.
Also, signiﬁcantly increased glycine availability in the
diet has been associated with an improvement in ether
extract digestibility (Han and Thacker, 2011). Glycine’s
availability is improved by betaine which creates bile
salts by connecting with the bile acids that the liver pro-
duces (Eklund et al., 2005; Powell et al., 2009). In addi-
tion, higher amounts of short-chain fatty acids in the
intestinal tract can increase the absorptive capacity of
the intestinal epithelium, resulting in better digestion
(Butzner et al., 1994). However, microbial activity is
thought to interfere with the excretion of bile acids
required for the digestion of lipids, thus affecting the
digestibility of ether extracts; this observation is consis-
tent with the ﬁndings of several studies showing that
betaine does not affect ether extract digestibility (Attia
et al., 2016; Ratriyanto et al., 2017 (. Betaine can
directly participate in biochemical processes such as
lipid metabolism, amino acid transport and regenera-
tion, and the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines
(Abu Ahmad et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). As pre-
sented here, the use of betaine supplementation in laying
hens’ diets increased egg weights at 57 wk, where the
treatment of complete replacement with betaine (500g/
ton) recorded the highest rates of egg weights compared
to other treatments during the experiment and also the
highest rates of increase albumin width than other treat-
ments. On the other hand, the change in the yolk color
recorded the lowest values in the control treatment
(500g/ton choline) than the other treatments. Thus, egg
quality was improved after betaine supplementation
under ambient temperature. Additionally, adding 0.10%
betaine to chicken feed has increased yolk weight, albu-
men and the Haugh unit (Ezzat et al., 2011; Attia et al.,
2016). Betaine inhibits hepatic fat accumulation while
increasing mitochondrial content and activity, suggest-
ing a betaine role in regulating fat metabolism (Zhang
et al., 2019). According toRatriyanto et al., (2017), the
effects of the retention of protein and energy metabolism
may be due to the addition of betaine 0.06-0.12%
increased egg weight in quail and increased egg yolk and
egg white weight in birds raised under natural tropical
conditions (Ratriyanto et al., 2018). Another observa-
tion suggested that adding 0.14% betaine to the laying
diet caused the yolk to develop more fat (Ratriyanto
Table 6.Effect of replacing choline with betaine on chemical fatty acid concentration in the egg yolk at the end of the experiment (57
wk).

et al., 2018). Regarding the increase in lipase and HDL
activity, the improved blood proﬁle may be related to
the improved egg quality, total protein and globulin, tri-
glycerides and the reduced total cholesterol and its
derivatives (LDL) (Ezzat et al., 2011; Awad et al.,
2014). Herein, the supplementation of choline and/or
betaine showed a signiﬁcant increase in the weights of
the oviduct, where the highest weight was in the control
treatment (500g/ton choline) and (250 g/ton choline
with 250g/ton betaine), it also led to a signi ﬁcant
increase in the weights of the isthmus during the treat-
ments. Betaine supplementation did not affect ovaries,
vagina, uterus, magnum, and cage weights, despite an
increase in oviduct length compared to control. The
increasing estrogen and progesterone levels in the blood
can be attributed to the augmentation in laying perfor-
mance with betaine. These hormones regulate ovulation
and oviduct development and regulate the ovulation
rate (Etches, 1996; Attia et al., 2016). Attia et al. (2016)
observed that supplementation of betaine at 0.10% in
laying hens led to an increase in oviduct weight and
length and an increase in the large ovarian follicles
weight, which contributed to an increase in egg produc-
tion. The present study reported no signiﬁcant change

for the biometric parameters of ALT, AST, total pro-
tein, albumin, globulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and its
derivatives (HDL and LDL) after the use of choline
and/or betaine supplement. The present ﬁndings are
consistent with Øverland et al. (1999)who found that
the betaine supplement did not affect plasma triglycer-
ides. Moreover, this study showed that chickens fed
betaine have higher antibody titers to the ND virus.
Betaine showed beneﬁcial effects on immune function of
broilers against Brucella abortus and Newcastle-modi-
ﬁed live or dead virus vaccine (Gonzalez-Vega-Aguire
et al., 1995). Farooqui et al. (2005) noted that the
immune response was suppressed by vaccines against
the respiratory virus and bursa fabricius gland weight
was increased by supplementation with 0.15% betaine;
supplementing birds with a 0.10% betaine increases
resistance to heat stress and vitamin C. Similarly, beta-
ine (1 g/kg) supplementation at 27 and 35 d of age sig-
niﬁcantly increased primary antibody titers to ND virus
(NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus in heat-stressed
broilers (Ghasemi et al., 2020). However, betaine supple-
mentation (0.121%) had no signiﬁcant effect on the
humoral immune response of 42-day-old broiler chickens
(Tsiagbe et al., 1988). Also, injection of betaine and cho-
line into oocytes did not affect immunoglobulin IgM and
IgG, or total antibody titers in hatched chicks (Gholami
et al., 2015) Betaine has been shown to stimulate the
humoral immune response by regulating cytokine pro-
duction in liver macrophages and inhibiting prostaglan-
din synthesis (Zhang et al.,1996), as well as increasing
nitric oxide release from heterophils and macrophages
(Klasing et al.,2002). Tsiagbe et al. (1988)observed that
choline addition in the chicken feed did not affect either
humoral or cellular immune responses when supple-
mented with methionine or alone,. Conversely, signiﬁ-
cant responses to choline addition were observed in
chicks’ antibody titers (Swain and Johri, 2000). In the
current study, dietary choline and/or betaine did not
differ signiﬁcantly in yolk chemical fatty acids proﬁle
concentration. Dietary supplementation of choline and/
or betaine in liver MDA content, yolk total cholesterol
vitamin E and fatty acid levels were not signiﬁcantly
affected by replaced choline to betaine groups. Although
some studies have suggested that betaine signiﬁcantly
impacts the concentration of fatty acids and the level of
MDA content. Betaine’s lipotropic activity also affects
the amount of body fat. Betaine increases the creation of
lecithin by providing methyl groups, which enables fat
to be transported throughout the body (Saunderson and
MacKinlay, 1990). Betaine also increases choline’s avail-
ability for synthesizing very low-density lipoprotein,
which reduces liver fat absorption and promotes hepatic
fat excretion (Yao and Vance, 1989; Hassan et al.,
2005). Moreover, it is associated with increased synthe-
sis of methylated substances, carnitine, and creatine, in
the liver and muscle via betaine (Zhan et al., 2006). The
internal membrane of mitochondria, where fatty acid
oxidation occurs, is traversed by carnitine to transport
long-chain fatty acids ( Wang et al., 2004 ). Betaine
can also improve antioxidant defense, reduce lipid
peroxidation, and improve poultry quality (Alirezaei
et al., 2012). In the current study, total antioxidant
capacity and MDA were not signiﬁcantly affected by
dietary supplementation of betaine choline, and their
combination. Antioxidant enzymes are generally the
ﬁrst defense in an animal cell
’s antioxidant system pro-
viding protective response to oxidative stress (Altan
et al., 2003). However, oxidative stress increases the
release of reactive oxygen species, which induces lipid
peroxidation reactions and increases the level of MDA in
tissues and plasma (Sahin et al., 2002).
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study shows that supplementing
hens with 500 g/ton of betaine increases performance
(egg weight and egg mass). Furthermore, using betaine
as a substitute for choline at rates of 500 g/ton improved
the stage’s production efﬁciency and increased egg pro-
duction and weight, as well as egg quality and bird
immune efﬁciency against various pathogens.
