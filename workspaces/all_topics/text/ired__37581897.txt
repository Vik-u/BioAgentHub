The NADPH-dependent imine reductase from Ajellomyces dermatitidis
(AdRedAm) catalyzes the reductive amination of certain ketones with amine
donors supplied in an equimolar ratio. The structure ofAdRedAm has been
determined in three forms. The ﬁrst form, which belongs to space groupP3121
and was reﬁned to 2.01 A˚ resolution, features two molecules (one dimer) in the
asymmetric unit in complex with the redox-inactive cofactor NADPH4.T h e
second form, which belongs to space group C21 and was reﬁned to 1.73 A˚
resolution, has nine molecules (four and a half dimers) in the asymmetric unit,
each complexed with NADP+. The third form, which belongs to space group
P3121 and was reﬁned to 1.52 A˚ resolution, has one molecule (one half-dimer) in
the asymmetric unit. This structure was again complexed with NADP+ and also
with the substrate 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone. The different data sets permit
the analysis of AdRedAm in different conformational states and also reveal
the molecular basis of stereoselectivity in the transformation of ﬂuorinated
acetophenone substrates by the enzyme.
1. Introduction
Chiral amines are important functionalities in biologically
active molecules and their asymmetric synthesis by reductive
amination is a signiﬁcant reaction in industrial medicinal
chemistry (Afanasyev et al., 2019). Recently, a subset of
NADPH-dependent imine reductase (IRED; Grogan &
Turner, 2016; Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2017) enzymes have been
identiﬁed that catalyze the reductive amination of a range of
ketones with small amine donors when supplied at one stoi-
chiometric equivalent (Fig. 1a;A l e k uet al., 2017; Gilioet al.,
2022). These ‘reductive aminases’ (RedAms; Alekuet al.,
2017; Gilio et al., 2022) have now been applied in the multi-
kilogram (Schober et al., 2019) and ton (Kumaret al., 2021)
scale synthesis of pharmaceutical precursors by many indus-
trial (Schoberet al., 2019; Kumaret al., 2021; Maet al., 2021)
and academic (Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020; Yanget al., 2021;
Zhang et al., 2022; Chenet al., 2023; Gilioet al., 2023) groups.
RedAms were ﬁrst identiﬁed in enzymes from fungi, and
structures of two of them, AspRedAm from Aspergillus
oryzae (Aleku et al., 2017) and AtRedAm from A. terreus
(Sharma et al., 2018), each in complex with the NADP
+
cofactor and substrate or product molecules, have been
published by our group.
These and other RedAms from fungi have been applied
in a number of preparative imine reductions and reductive
aminations (Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020; Ramsdenet al., 2019;
Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). One of
them, AdRedAm from Ajellomyces dermatitidis, has been

reported to be more stable thanAspRedAm (Zachos et al.,
2021) and thus perhaps more suitable for process applications.
Indeed, AdRedAm has already been applied to the asym-
metric reduction of imine substrates, including dibenzazepines
such as4 (Fig. 1b; Franceet al., 2017) and pyrrolidines such as
6 (Fig. 1c; Costaet al., 2018), and also the reductive amination
of cyclohexanone (1) with various amines (Alekuet al., 2017).
In addition, AdRedAm has been used in a biocatalytic ﬂow
system for the reductive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde
(8) with allylamine (9)( F i g .1d; Finnigan et al., 2020). Given
the enduring interest in AdRedAm as a catalyst, we have
determined its structure using X-ray crystallography to assist
in the interpretation of experimental biotransformation results
and also for structure-guided engineering. The structure,
which has been obtained in three crystal forms, sheds light on
the conformational dynamics of the enzyme, cofactor binding,
and also the molecular determinants of stereoselectivity in the
transformations of the substrate 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Macromolecule production
Cloning and expression of the gene encodingAdRedAm
and puriﬁcation of the protein have been reported previously
(Aleku et al., 2017). The protein, which was puriﬁed using
nickel-afﬁnity chromatography followed by size-exclusion
chromatography, was concentrated to 40 mg ml
/C0 1 using
centrifugal concentrators with a molecular-weight cutoff of
10 kDa.
2.2. Crystallization
Concentrated protein at 40 mg ml/C0 1 was subjected to crys-
tallization trials in a range of commercial screens in 96-well
plate format, using 150 nl protein solution and 150 nl preci-
pitant solution and a Mosquito robot (SPT Labtech). Crystals
for data set 1 were harvested from conditions consisting of
0.1 M PCTP buffer (sodium propionate, sodium cacodylate
trihydrate, bis-Tris propane) pH 4.0, 25% PEG 1500 with the
protein pre-complexed with 2 mM NADPH
4. Crystals for data
set 2 were recovered from conditions consisting of 0.1M MES
buffer pH 6.0, 0.2M MgCl2, 20% PEG 6000 with the protein
pre-complexed with 2 mM NADP+. Crystals for data set 3
were grown in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.6, 0.2M MgCl2,
20%(w/v) PEG 3350 with the protein pre-complexed with
2m M NADP+ and 10 mM 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone. Crys-
tallization information is summarized in Table 1.
2.3. Data collection and processing
Data were collected on beamlines I03 and I04-1 at the
Diamond Light Source (DLS) and were processed and inte-
grated using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled usingSCALA
(Evans, 2006) within the xia2 (Winter, 2010) processing
system. Data-collection statistics can be found in Table 2.

2.4. Structure solution and refinement
Crystals furnishing data set 1 were obtained in space group
P3121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit constituting
one dimer. The structure was solved withMOLREP (Vagin &
Teplyakov, 2010) using the structure of the imine reductase
from A. oryzae (54% sequence identity; PDB entry 5g6r;
Aleku et al., 2017) as the molecular-replacement model. The
structure was solved using iterative cycles ofCoot (Emsley
et al., 2010) and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 2011). After
building the protein backbone, side chains and water mole-
cules, residual density was present in the omit map in one
active site. This could be modelled and reﬁned as the inactive
cofactor molecule NADP
4. Data sets 2 and 3, in space groups
C21 and P3121, respectively, were processed, built and reﬁned
in a similar fashion to data set 1, yielding structures with nine
and one monomers in the asymmetric unit, respectively. Data
set 2 featured density consistent with nine molecules of
NADP
+ in nine active sites; data set 3 featured density
consistent with one molecule of NADP+ in its active site, and
also residual density adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of
the cofactor that was successfully modelled and reﬁned as
2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone (15). The Ramachandran plot for
the structure from data set 1 revealed 99.6% of residues in
favoured regions, with 0.4% outliers. The corresponding
ﬁgures for data sets 2 and 3 were also 99.6% of residues in
favoured regions with 0.4% outliers. Reﬁnement statistics for
the structures can be found in Table 3. Coordinates and
structure-factor ﬁles have been deposited in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) for data sets 1, 2 and 3 with accession codes 8ozw,
8p2j and 8ozv, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The gene encoding AdRedAm was codon-optimized for
expression in Escherichia coli and was expressed in E. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme was puriﬁed by nickel-afﬁnity
(Ni–NTA) chromatography and size-exclusion chromato-
graphy (SEC) using previously described methods (Aleku
et al., 2017), and the pure protein was concentrated to
40 mg ml
/C0 1 for crystallization. The enzyme crystallized in
three forms. The ﬁrst form (data set 1), which belonged to
space group P3
121 and was reﬁned to 2.01 A˚ resolution,
contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit representing
one dimer. The second form (data set 2), which belonged to
space groupC2
1 and was reﬁned to 1.73 A˚ resolution, had nine
molecules in the asymmetric unit, representing four and a half
dimers. The third form (data set 3) belonged to space group
P3
121 and was reﬁned to 1.52 A˚ resoution. This structure
featured only one molecule as a half-dimer in the asymmetric

Using data set 1, the structure ofAdRedAm was solved
using the structure ofAspRedAm (sequence identity of 54%)
as a model. The structure was built and reﬁned using iterative
cycles of building inCoot and reﬁnement inREFMAC.T h i s
data set yielded two molecules in the asymmetric unit as a
dimer, which is the canonical form of previously described
imine reductases (Alekuet al., 2016, 2017; Rodrı´ guez-Mata et
al., 2013; Huberet al., 2014; Manet al., 2015). Electron density
for the backbone atoms was largely complete throughout the
length of both chains from Ala2 to Lys288. The monomer of
AdRedAm was compared with existing structures using the
DALI server (Holm, 2022). Its closest structural homologs
were AspRedAm (PDB entry 5g6r; Z-score 34.6; 54%
sequence identity; r.m.s.d. of 1.0 A˚ over 289 C
/C11atoms; Aleku
et al., 2017), NfRedAm from Neosartorya fumigata (PDB
entry 6sle; Z-score 33.8; 50% sequence identity; r.m.s.d. of
1.2 A˚ over 278 C/C11atoms; Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020) and the
imine reductase fromStreptosporangium roseum (PDB entry
5ocm; 39% sequence identity; r.m.s.d. of 1.2 A˚ over 282 C/C11
atoms; Lenzet al., 2018).AdRedAm adopts the known IRED
fold, with an N-terminal NADP +-binding domain (Ala2–
Val162) connected by a long inter-domain helix (Gly163–
Ser192) to a C-terminal helical bundle (Ala193–Lys288)
(Fig. 2a).
The twoAdRedAm monomers associate to form a dimer in
which reciprocal domain sharing results in the formation of a
large active-site cleft between the N-terminal domain of one
monomer and the C-terminal domain of its partner. In the
structure from data set 1, following building of the protein and
water molecules one of the active sites featured clear density
in the omit map that could be modelled as the redox-inactive
cofactor NADPH
4, with which the protein had been
complexed (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, the other active site
featured no cofactor density. A comparison of monomers with
and without NADPH4 showed that the side chain of Asn94
was rotated approximately 180/C14 to accommodate the ribose of
the cofactor, but that the orientation of the other side chains
was largely conserved.

Structure ofAdRedAm from data set 3. The symmetry neighbour has been incorporated (C atoms in brown) to show the contribution of both monomers

maps at a level of 2.5/C27obtained before reﬁnement of the ligand atoms, which have been added for clarity.
Despite a sequence homology of only 54%, the active site
of AdRedAm is highly conserved compared with that of
AspRedAm (for example PDB entry 5g6r; Alekuet al., 2017),
with Asp169 and Asn94, which are thought to have roles in
amine activation in the reductive aminase mechanism (Sharma
et al., 2018), and Tyr177, which is implicated in ketone acti-
vation, superimposing well with the equivalent residues in
AspRedAm (Fig. 2b). In addition, hydrophobic residues in
AspRedAm that were shown to form a binding pocket for
ketone substrates (Alekuet al., 2017), including Leu173 and
Met176 from the interdomain helix and Trp208 and Met212
from the C-terminal domain of the partner monomer
(monomer B in Fig. 2b), are also conserved, with Met237 and
Gln238 at the front of the active site.
The sequences and structures are less conserved in other
regions. In the N-terminal domain ofAdRedAm there are
several differences between Ser60 and His110 when compared
with AspRedAm, including Lys70 (Asn69 in AspRedAm),
which forms an ionic interaction with Glu102 (Lys101) in
AdRedAm. There are also differences at Trp84 (Leu83) and
Trp106 (Phe105), residues that both project into the hydro-
phobic core of the N-terminal domain that also includes Leu77
(Leu76) and Ile89 (Ile88), which are both conserved between
the enzymes. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Thr103 in
AdRedAm, which is replaced by Leu102 inAspRedAm, forms
a new hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of
His99 (Gln98).
However, the major difference in tertiary structure between
the AdRedAm andAspRedAm monomers is a shorter loop of
11 residues between Leu189 and Gly199 (L VQSANIPAAG)
in the C-terminal helical bundle in AdRedAm, which was
14 residues (LIKSGQDTSTTATG) between Leu189 and
Gly202 in AspRedAm. This loop, which is at the dimer
interface, positions Ala193 and Ile195 in AdRedAm for
hydrophobic interactions with Leu164 and Leu167 in the
partner monomer. Just downstream of this loop, in the region
between Val190 and Thr210, Val190 (Ile190), Ile195 (Asp195),
Leu189 (Leu189) and Phe200 (Leu203) also make hydro-
phobic interactions with Ala171 and Leu172 of the neigh-
bouring monomer at the dimer interface. Recent studies of the
engineering of IREDs for improved stability using random
mutagenesis suggest that mutations that enhance interactions,
including hydrophobic forces, at the dimer interface were
signiﬁcant in producing variants with greater process stability
(Schober et al., 2019; Kumaret al., 2021; Maet al., 2021) and,
indeed, previous research has suggested that AdRedAm is
more stable than AspRedAm (Zachos et al., 2021). A
comparative analysis of AspRedAm and AdRedAm using
PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) suggests thatAdRedAm
should be more stable, with a monomer–monomer interfacial
interaction of 4107 A˚
2 versus 3918 A˚2. This would suggest a
free energy of dissociation of/C0 84.8 kJ mol/C0 1 for AdRedAm
versus /C0 78.3 kJ mol/C0 1 for AspRedAm and thus greater
stability, as observed experimentally.
The AdRedAm dimer observed in the structure from data
set 1 was already instructive in showing two possible states of
the monomer in which the non-natural cofactor molecule was
either absent or bound. Variations were also readily observed
amongst the four dimers present in the structure from data set
2, which was obtained from crystals that grew in space group
C2
1 and featured nine molecules in the asymmetric unit. In
this structure, once again, the vast majority of backbone atoms
could be modelled in subunitsA–I from, in some cases, the
leucine and phenylalanine residues in the puriﬁcation tag at
positions /C0 5 and /C0 4 through to Lys288. The exception was
chain H, in which electron density for Gly229–Gly232 was
poor and could not be modelled. In the case of data set 2, all
monomers featured electron density in the omit maps that
could be modelled as the cofactor NADP
+. Despite the
presence of the cofactor in all monomers, the difference in the
conformation of some monomers was pronounced. In the most
divergent examples, monomers E and I exhibited a hinge
movement between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of
14.8
/C14 as calculated using theDynDom server (Fig. 2c; Lee et
al., 2003), with the hinge movement centred around the
pendant aspartate residue Asp169. This was comparable to the
most pronounced difference in conformation observed in
multiple dimer structures ofAtRedAm (Sharmaet al., 2018).
The overall effect of the hinge movement is to close the active
site with respect to the cofactor, presumably to provide the
hydrophobic environment that is required to favour greater
stability of the transient imine intermediate.
The structure that resulted from data set 3 was more
unusual, although not unique amongst IRED structures, in
featuring only one monomer (for example PDB entry 6skx;
Mangas-Sanchez et al., 2020) or a half-dimer within the
asymmetric unit. However, this data set provides signiﬁcant
further information on ligand recognition withinAdRedAm.
This structure was obtained from crystals that had been
co-crystallized with the ligand 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone (15;
Fig. 3) in an effort to shed light on the mixed selectivity of
AdRedAm towards ﬂuorinated acetophenones, for which
both alcohol products and reductive amination products are
observed (Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020). Fluorinated aceto-
phenones are unusual amongst IRED substrates as, with the
exception of some examples using engineered enzymes (Jiaet
al., 2021), these ketones are the only examples of carbonyl
compounds that undergo signiﬁcant reduction to the alcohol
(Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020; Lenzet al., 2017).
Indeed, when presented with 15, the reduced cofactor
NADPH and methylamine,AdRedAm catalyzes the forma-
tion of the (S)-alcohol product16 and the (S)-amine product
17 in 47% and 25% yield, respectively (Fig. 3), whereas the
reduction of acetophenone (11) or 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone
(18) under the same conditions gave only theN-methyl (12)o r
alcohol products (19), respectively (Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al.,
2020).
A previous structure of an IRED fromS. roseumreported
by our group (SrIRED; PDB entry 5ocm Lenzet al., 2018) was
presented in complex with the hydrate20 of ketone 18 and
suggested that the signiﬁcant disposition towards ketone
reduction in the case of18 may be due not only to the extra
activation of the carbonyl C atom, but also to aspects of
speciﬁc substrate recognition within the active site. The
research communications
228 Mahima Sharma et al. /C15 Imine reductase Acta Cryst. (2023). F79, 224–230
complex showed that the ﬂuorine substituents of 20 made
hydrogen-bonding interactions with the O2D hydroxyl of the
NADP
+ ribose, thus drawing the electrophilic C atom of the
substrate C O group sufﬁciently close to the C4 atom of the
cofactor for hydride exchange to occur.
For the structure from data set 3, once the protein, water
and cofactor atoms had been modelled, signiﬁcant omit
density persisted within the active site that could be modelled
as the added ketone ligand 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone ( 15;
Fig. 2d) and not as the hydrate form observed forSrIRED
with 20. In the complex ofAdRedAm with15, the phenyl ring
of the substrate is stacked against the side chain of Met176; the
carbonyl group of the ketone is coordinated to the phenolic
hydroxyl of the side chain of Tyr177 at a distance of 3.0 A˚.T h e
F atoms are again positioned 3.2 and 3.3 A˚ from the O2D atom
of the ribose sugar, suggesting again that these interactions
may be signiﬁcant in permitting the reduction of the ketone by
the cofactor to some extent, but only in the case where F atoms
are present. However, the electrophilic C atom is not as ideally
placed for hydride exchange as observed for20 in PDB entry
5ocm, as the distance of the electrophilic C atom from the
NADP
+ atom is suboptimal at 4.5 A˚. In addition, the ketone
15 presents itsre face to the cofactor, which would result in the
experimentally observed (S)-alcohol product. The complex
illustrates the imperfect binding of the ﬂuorinated ketone15
for either amine or alcohol production, and also provides a
basis for understanding the stereoselectivity ofAdRedAm for
transformations of substrates in this series.
AdRedAm is a useful biocatalyst for a number of imine-
reduction and reductive amination reactions. The presented
structures ofAdRedAm provide new insights into conforma-
tional dynamics in this IRED, interactions that confer superior
stability and also the basis for steroselectivity and chemo-
selectivity in the transformation of ﬂuorinated ketones. In
addition to these insights, these and other structures of IREDs
will serve as valuable platforms for the structure-guided
engineering of IREDs for improved process stability.
