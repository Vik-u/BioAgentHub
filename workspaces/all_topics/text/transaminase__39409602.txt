Abstract: Albizia odoratissima is a deciduous tree species belonging to the family Leguminosae. It
is widely distributed in the southern subtropical and tropical areas of China and has important
ecological and economic value. The growth and metabolic processes of A. odoratissima are affected by
drought stress, but the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, this study investigated
the physicochemical properties, gene expression, and metabolites of A. odoratissima seedlings under
drought stress. The results show that, in leaves of A. odoratissima seedlings, drought stress reduced
the moisture content, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, superoxide dismutase (SOD)
activity, and gibberellin (GA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) contents while increasing the catalase (CAT)
and peroxidase (POD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, soluble sugar, and soluble
protein contents. Within the CK5 (Day 5 of control group) vs. T5 (Day 5 of drought treatment), CK10
vs. T10, CK15 vs. T15, and CK20 vs. T20 groups (CK: control group; T: drought treatment), a total
of 676 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated and 518 DEGs were downregulated,
and a total of 228 and 143 differential accumulation metabolites (DAMs) were identified in the CK10
vs. T10 and CK20 vs. T20 groups. These were mainly involved in the amino acid and alkaloid
metabolism pathways in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings. In the amino acid and alkaloid
biosynthesis pathways, the relative expression levels of the AoproA (Aod04G002740, ORTHODONTIC
APPLIANCE), AoOAT (Aod07G015970, ORNITHINE-OXO-ACID TRANSAMINASE), and AoAOC3
(Aod12G005010/08G003360/05G023920/08G003000/08G003010, AMINE OXIDASE COPPER CONTAIN-
ING 3) genes increased, which concurrently promoted the accumulation of arginine, proline, piperine,
cadaverine, and lysine. Furthermore, some key transcription factors in the response to drought
were identified in the leaves using the weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA)
method. These findings reveal that A. odoratissima seedlings respond to drought stress by improving
the capacities of the antioxidant system and secondary metabolism.

1. Introduction
Drought is one of the major limiting factors for plant growth, development, yield, and
distribution, seriously affecting the health of the global agroforestry industry [1]. Drought
stress has important effects on plant morphology and structure, photosynthesis, antioxidant
regulators, gene expression, and secondary metabolic processes. Drought stress induces the

production and accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells
and subsequently promotes lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in
the cells, resulting in membrane damage and structural incompleteness. Under drought
conditions, the pigment content and photosynthetic efficiency in leaves significantly de-
crease, and, simultaneously, the transpiration rate decreases, as stomatal conductance is
limited to reduce intracellular water loss, ultimately causing morphological changes in
plants [2]. Meanwhile, drought stress promotes the biosynthesis and accumulation of
soluble sugar, soluble protein, free proline, some secondary metabolites, and resistance
hormones, thereby regulating plant growth and development [ 3]. Variations in these
metabolites are controlled by the plant’s genes, suggesting that drought stress impacts
metabolite content by regulating the expression levels of key genes in the biosynthesis and
signal transduction pathways in plants [4]. The time and intensity of drought stress affect
the cell division, physicochemical properties, gene expression, and metabolite accumulation
in plants [5].
Plants develop numerous complex mechanisms in response to drought stress, such as
phenotypic changes, physicochemical mechanisms, and molecular mechanisms, thereby
improving drought resistance and adaptability [6–9]. In tobacco, drought stress has been
found to increase the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), cata-
lase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), as well as the
contents of soluble sugar, soluble protein, free proline, and glutathione (GSH), thereby re-
ducing the damage of ROS to cells and ultimately increasing drought resistance [10]. Under
drought stress, the concentrations of auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid decrease, while
the concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroid (BR), ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid
(JA), salicylic acid (SA), and strigolactone (SL) increase, thereby regulating homeostasis
and improving drought resistance in plants [11]. Furthermore, drought stress increases
the relative expression levels of the MALATE DEHYDROGENASE (MDH), PYRUV ATE
DEHYDROGENASE (PDH), delta(1)-PYRROLINE-5-CAEBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE(P5CS),
HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN (HSP), and CYTOCHROME P450 (CYP) genes, which are related
to resistance and metabolism. This subsequently impacts the biosynthesis and accumu-
lation of glucose, fructose, phenylpropanoids, carotenoids, zeaxanthin, monoterpenes,
4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and ferulic acid, which are involved in the pathways of the tricar-
boxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, glutamate-mediated proline biosynthesis, sucrose and starch
metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine biosynthesis,
and secondary metabolism. Finally, this leads to the regulation of anatomical structures,
physicochemical processes, and secondary metabolic processes, eventually improving the
resistance and gene expression of the plants [12–19].
Albizia odoratissima is a diploid (2n = 26) deciduous tree species belonging to the family
Leguminosae. A. odoratissima exhibits rapid growth, good wood properties, resistance to bar-
renness, and a strong renewal ability; therefore, it is cultivated at a large scale in Guangxi,
Hainan, and other regions in China [ 20]. A. odoratissima has significant economic value
because of its density, durability, stability, and resistance to decay and insect infestation,
and it is widely used in high-quality furniture manufacturing, construction, and other
industries [21,22]. Meanwhile, A. odoratissima also has significant ecological value as a
top-ranking nitrogen-fixing tree species owing to its rhizobia, and it plays important roles in
soil and water conservation and carbon sink increase. Moreover, A. odoratissima, as a native
timber species, exhibits strong drought resistance, the strength of which is ranked as fol-
lows: Guangxi Leye > Yunnan Xinping > Guangxi Pingxiang [23]. Therefore, A. odoratissima
is applied in the construction of large-scale forestry projects, for example, for the precise
improvement of Guangxi’s forest quality, the national reserve forest, and the adjustment
of tree species structure. However, the molecular mechanism of A. odoratissima seedlings’
response to drought stress is still unknown. In this study, the leaf morphology and struc-
ture, physicochemical characteristics, gene expression, and metabolite accumulation of A.
odoratissima under drought stress were investigated, and the molecular mechanism of A.

odoratissima seedlings’ response to drought stress was revealed. These findings provide a
theoretical basis for the genetic breeding of A. odoratissima.
2. Results
2.1. Structural and Physiological Changes in A. odoratissima Seedlings under Drought Stress
With the gradual extension of drought stress treatment, the color of the A. odoratissima
seedling leaf blades gradually changed from green to yellow, and the compound petioles
gently drooped (Figure 1a). At the same time, the upper epidermis of the leaf blades
thinned, the spongy tissues shortened and dispersed, the cell gaps widened, the main veins
became smaller and fewer in number, and the xylem of the seedlings shortened, indicating
that drought stress influenced the structure of the A. odoratissima seedlings (Figure 1b and
Table S1).

Compared with the control groups, the chlorophyll content in the leaves of the experi-
mental samples gradually decreased with the duration of drought stress, and it presented a
significant difference from that in the control groups on the 10th and 15th days (Figure 1j).
Meanwhile, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) in the leaves significantly increased on
the 5th and 20th days, while transpiration rate (Tr) gradually decreased with the increase
in the duration of drought stress and exhibited notable differences from that of the control
groups in different periods (Figure 1k,l). Under the same conditions, net photosynthetic
rate (Pn) also decreased and showed obvious differences from that in the control groups on
the 10th, 15th, and 20th days (Figure 1m). Furthermore, stomatal conductance (Gs) began
to decrease on the 10th day under the drought stress treatment, and it was significantly
lower than that in the control groups (Figure 1n).
The free proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein contents in the leaves significantly
increased with the duration of the drought stress treatment, and the free proline content
was notably higher than that in the control groups during the corresponding periods
(Figure 1g–i). Under the same conditions, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in
the leaves decreased, but the malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased, as well as the
peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities, compared with those in the control groups
(Figure 1c–f). Meanwhile, the gibberellin (GA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), and zeatin ribo-
side (ZR) contents in the leaves decreased compared with those in the control groups
(Figure 1o–q). Moreover, the moisture content in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings
gradually decreased, with the difference from the control group becoming significant from
the 10th day onward, indicating that drought stress affected the physiological properties of
the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings (Figure 1r).
2.2. Transcriptome Analysis of A. odoratissima Seedlings under Drought Stress
The RNA of the leaf and root samples was extracted and assessed, and transcriptome
sequencing was subsequently performed. Over 6.6 Gb of clean data were generated
for each sample, and Q20 ranged from approximately 96.33% to 98.31% (Table S2). The
clean reads from the transcriptome sequencing were aligned with the reference genome
of A. odoratissima, and the FPKM values were calculated. A correlation analysis of these
FPKM values revealed a consistency of over 90% among the replicates for each sample,
demonstrating the high reproducibility and reliability of the generated transcriptomic data
(Figure 2a,b).

Within the groups of CK5 vs. T5, CK10 vs. T10, CK15 vs. T15, and CK20 vs. T20, a
total of 5312, 4949, 3199, and 4954 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the leaves were
upregulated, and a total of 3130, 3179, 4394, and 7929 DEGs in the leaves were downreg-
ulated (Figure 2c). A Venn analysis revealed that 676 DEGs were upregulated and that
518 DEGs were downregulated in the leaves in the four comparison groups (Figure 2d,e).
The upregulated DEGs in the leaves were mainly annotated in the pathways of metabolism;
the degradation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine; starch and sucrose metabolism; sec-
ondary metabolite biosynthesis; and lysine biosynthesis (Figure 2h). The upregulated DEGs
were mainly involved in the processes of quercetin O-glucoside metabolism, kaempferol
O-glucoside metabolism, beta-glucoside metabolism, s-glycoside catabolism, and glucosi-
nolate catabolism (Figure S1). Conversely, the downregulated DEGs were annotated in the
pathways of photosynthesis, photosynthetic antenna proteins, metabolism, cyanogenic gly-
coside metabolism, and the biosynthesis of various alkaloids (Figure 2i). A GO enrichment
analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs were related to the photosynthesis, pho-
toreaction, light harvesting by photosystem I, precursor metabolite, energy generation, and
light-harvesting pathways (Figure S2). These results indicate that drought stress regulated
the metabolic processes in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings.
Within the CK5 vs. T5, CK10 vs. T10, CK15 vs. T15, and CK20 vs. T20 groups,
a total of 2190, 2377, 2665, and 3380 DEGs in the roots were upregulated, and a total
of 2529, 4079, 4600, and 5511 DEGs in the roots were downregulated (Figure 2c). A
Venn analysis of the DEGs revealed that 146 DEGs were upregulated and that 608 DEGs
were downregulated in the roots in the four comparison groups at all four time points
(Figure 2f,g). The upregulated DEGs in the roots were mainly annotated in the pathways of
flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, plant–pathogen interactions, endocytosis, phagosomes,
and isoflavonoid biosynthesis (Figure 2j). The upregulated DEGs were mainly involved
in the processes of pollen maturation, the regulation of photosynthesis and photoreaction,
flower organ development, ovule identity determination, and azole or thiazole biosynthesis
(Figure S3). Conversely, the downregulated DEGs were annotated in the pathways of
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, metabolism, MAPK
signaling, and thiamine metabolism (Figure 2k). A GO enrichment analysis showed that
the downregulated DEGs were related to syncytium formation, cell wall modification for
multidimensional cell growth, the negative regulation of cellular aging, and the regulation
of cation channel activity (Figure S4). These results indicate that drought stress regulated
the metabolic processes in the roots of the A. odoratissima seedlings.
2.3. Metabolome Analysis of A. odoratissima Seedlings under Drought Stress
The metabolites in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings under drought stress
were determined using non-targeted metabolome technology after 0, 10, and 20 d. A total
of 729 metabolites grouped into 25 categories were identified, with the top 3 categories
being phenolic acids (103 species, 14.03%), amino acids and their derivatives (75 species,
10.22%), and flavones (64 species, 8.72%) (Figure 3c). A PCA showed that PC1 accounted
for 40.47%, PC2 accounted for 19.31%, and PC3 accounted for 16.10%, and three replicates
of each of the five groups and quality controls revealed a high degree of correlation
approaching 1 (Figure 3a,b). The results of both the PCA and correlation analysis indicated
strong consistency among the three replicates of each of the five metabolic profile samples,
enabling the five samples to be effectively distinguished and providing robust data support
for subsequent analyses.
Differential accumulation metabolites (DAMs) were selected based on a standard fold
change of ≥1.5 or ≤0.67 and a VIP ≥ 1. Within the CK10 vs. T10 group, a total of 228 DAMs
were identified, among which 64 metabolites were upregulated, and 164 metabolites were
downregulated. These were mainly enriched in tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid
biosynthesis; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; arginine and proline metabolism; amino acid
biosynthesis; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (Figure 3e). Within the CK20
vs. T20 group, the treatment group had 143 DAMs, among which 56 metabolites were
Plants 2024, 13, 2732 7 of 21
upregulated and 87 metabolites were downregulated (Figure 3d). These were mainly
annotated in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism; tropane,
piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis; D-amino acid metabolism; and ABC trans-
porters (Figure 3f).

expression of the AoproA and AoOAT genes and increased the levels of arginine (kz000360)
and proline (kz000318) (Figure 4). These results show that drought stress promoted proline
biosynthesis by improving the expression levels of crucial genes in its metabolic pathway
in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings.

of lysine (kz000339), a precursor of tropane, piperine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis

drought stress promoted the biosynthesis of tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloids by
increasing the expression levels of key genes in the leaves of theA. odoratissimaseedlings.

2.5. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis of A. odoratissima under Drought Stress 
Data on soluble sugar, soluble protein, GA, Pn, proline, POD, and CAT were used as 
trait ﬁles, and, by using all 54 transcriptome datasets (Table S2), 35 modules were ulti-
mately constructed using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) 
method. Among these 35 modules, the blue and cyan modules exhibited signiﬁcant posi-
tive correlations with GA and Pn, and they exhibited signiﬁcant negative correlations with 
proline, soluble protein, soluble sugar, CAT, and POD (Figure S5).  
The blue module contained 3256 genes, which were mainly annotated in the path-
ways of photosynthesis antenna proteins; carbon ﬁxation in photosynthetic organisms; 
photosynthesis; carbon metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, 
serine, and threonine metabolism; and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (Figure S6). A GO en-
richment analysis showed that these genes we re enriched in the processes of photosyn-
thesis, photosynthesis photoreaction, photos ynthesis light harvesting, photosynthesis 
light harvesting in photosystem I, RNA modiﬁcation, metabolism, and nucleic acid phos-
phodiester bond hydrolysis (Figure S7). In the cyan module, a total of 571 genes were 
identiﬁed in the KEGG database, which were primarily annotated in the pathways of gly-
cosaminoglycan degradation; protein processi ng in the endoplasmic reticulum; carbon 
metabolism; sulfur metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; porphyrin metabolism; valine, leu-
cine, and isoleucine degradation; an d the biosynthesis of unsaturated fa tty acids (Figure

(Figure S9).
Based on the criteria |Gene Significance (GS)| > 0.85 or |Module Membership

In the blue module, MYB (6), bHLH (7), b-ZIP (5), TCP (5), WRKY (2), NAC (5), WD40
(5), ERF (4), HSF (3), and several other transcription factors were obtained, and they
were mainly annotated in the pathways of photosynthesis (ko00195); purine metabolism
(ko00230); alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (ko00250); glycine, serine, and thre-
onine metabolism (ko00260); amino acid biosynthesis (ko01230); and pyruvate metabolism
(ko00620) (Figure 6a). Within the cyan module, MYB (3), bHLH (2), b-ZIP (1), TCP (1),
WRKY (1), WD40 (1), ERF (1), and multiple other transcription factors were identified, and
they were enriched in the processes of fatty acid metabolism (ko01212); valine, leucine, and

glycerolipid metabolism (ko00561); amino acid biosynthesis (ko01230); and pyruvate
metabolism (ko00620) (Figure 6b). In order to further verify the effects of drought stress
on the gene expression levels of the A. odoratissima seedlings, 16 key functional genes
were randomly selected for qRT-PCR verification (Figure S10). The results show that the
expression levels of the above 16 genes were basically consistent with the RNA-seq results,
indicating that the sequencing results are reliable.

3. Discussion
3.1. Drought Stress Inhibits the Growth of A. odoratissima Seedlings
Water serves as a solvent and regulates the physiological metabolic reactions in cells,
eventually affecting the growth and development of plants [24]. Drought stress is caused
by water loss in soil and, in turn, influences the pigment content, photosynthetic efficiency,
and ultrastructure in plants [25,26]. In the present study, the moisture content in the leaves
of A. odoratissima seedlings gradually decreased with the increase in drought duration, and
significant differences emerged on the 10th day, indicating that drought reduced the mois-
ture content in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings. Under the same conditions, the
leaf mesophyll structures and leaf vein thickness of the A. odoratissima seedlings decreased
compared with those of the control group, suggesting that drought stress impedes the
water flow in cells, thereby enhancing the adaptability of A. odoratissima seedlings [27]. At
the same time, leaf development was associated with the intracellular hormone content. In
the drought stress treatment, the zeatin riboside (ZR) content in the leaves decreased and
then increased, but the indoleacetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin (GA) contents in the leaves
gradually decreased with prolonged drought stress, indicating that drought stress inhibited
leaf development by reducing the endogenous hormone contents, thereby delaying the
growth and improving the drought tolerance of the A. odoratissima seedlings [28].
Chlorophyll is the main carrier of photosynthesis in leaves, and its content determines
the photosynthetic capacity and growth rate of plants, but its biosynthesis and accumu-
lation are affected by drought stress [29]. In this experiment, drought stress reduced the
total chlorophyll content while concurrently decreasing transpiration rate (Tr) and net
photosynthetic rate (Pn) but increased the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) in the leaves,
suggesting that drought stress reduced the photosynthetic capacity by decreasing the total
chlorophyll content in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings. The decrease in the total
chlorophyll content reduced the light capture and utilization ability, subsequently reduced
the photosynthetic capacity, and eventually inhibited growth and tissue development,
thereby improving the tolerance of the A. odoratissima seedlings [30]. However, drought
stress induced stomatal closure, which controls gas exchange and water loss, to increase
Tr and Pn, ultimately delaying the growth and tissue development of the leaves of the
A. odoratissima seedlings [31]. In order to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress,
leaves can reduce transpiration. This subsequently enhances the accumulation of Ci, which
inhibits photosynthesis at high concentrations and, in turn, reduces the photosynthetic
capacity and growth of A. odoratissima seedlings to improve adaptability [32].
3.2. Drought Stress Improves the Antioxidant Capacity of A. odoratissima Seedlings
Drought stress rapidly induces ROS production, promotes lipid peroxidation and
malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, destroys the integrity of cell membranes, and alters
the morphology and structure of tissues and organs, ultimately inhibiting the growth, yield,
and quality of plants [ 33,34]. The previous result showed that drought stress induced
MDA formation and promoted the biosynthesis and accumulation of soluble substances,
thereby regulating the osmotic pressure and water potential in cells and thus enhancing
the tolerance of plants [35]. In the present study, drought stress increased the MDA content
in the leaves, and the proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein contents in the leaves
also increased with an increasing duration of drought stress, indicating that drought stress
promoted lipid peroxidation and the accumulation of soluble substances in the leaves of
the A. odoratissima seedlings. Proline, as an important amino acid, has the crucial functions
of regulating osmosis, reducing acidity, enhancing the redox capacity, and maintaining
the structural stability of cells, and plants can promote its synthesis and accumulation
to improve their drought resistance [ 36]. Soluble sugar and protein are mainly derived
from photosynthetic products and the degradation of biological macromolecules, which
play roles in osmotic regulation and water potential, as well as providing energy and a
substrate for substance biosynthesis in cells, thereby regulating growth and adaptability to
Plants 2024, 13, 2732 13 of 21
drought stress [37,38]. Therefore, A. odoratissima seedlings demonstrated enhanced drought
tolerance as a result of the promoted accumulation of soluble substance in their leaves.
Drought stress not only influences the content of soluble substances but also regulates
the activity of the antioxidase system in plants. The main antioxidases are superoxide
dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), which can increase adaptability
by clearing the ROS in plants [39]. In this study, drought stress decreased the SOD activity
but increased the POD and CAT activities in the leaves, indicating that the A. odoratissima
seedlings demonstrated improved drought resistance as a result of enhanced POD and
CAT activities in their leaves. SOD catalyzes the formation of hydrogen peroxide by the
superoxide anion, but the decrease in the SOD activity in the leaves indicates that the
superoxide anion is not the predominant ROS type induced by drought stress [40]. POD
and CAT mainly remove the hydrogen peroxide in cells; thus, an increase in these enzymes’
activities can mitigate the damage to and improve the drought tolerance of plants [ 41].
These results indicate that theA. odoratissima seedlings demonstrated improved adaptability
and drought resistance as a result of enhanced POD and CAT activities in their leaves.
3.3. Drought Stress Promotes the Accumulation of Amino Acids and Alkaloids
Drought stress regulates gene expression and metabolic processes, which, in turn,
affect plant growth [42]. In the present study, a total of 676 differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were upregulated and 518 DEGs were downregulated in leaves of A. odoratissima
seedlings. The upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the pathways of metabolism;
valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; starch and sucrose metabolism; secondary
metabolite biosynthesis; and lysine biosynthesis. In contrast, the downregulated DEGs were
annotated in the pathways of photosynthesis, photosynthesis–haptoglobin, metabolism,
cyanogenic glycoside metabolism, and alkaloid biosynthesis. This suggests that drought
stress affects physiological and metabolic processes by regulating the gene expression in
the leaves of A. odoratissima seedlings. In the drought stress treatment, within the CK10
vs. T10 group, a total of 228 differential accumulation metabolites (DAMs) were identified,
among which 64 metabolites were upregulated, and 164 metabolites were downregulated.
Within the CK20 vs. T20 group, the treatment group had 143 DAMs, among which 56
metabolites were upregulated, and 87 metabolites were downregulated. The top five
bioprocesses of the upregulated DAMs were metabolic pathways; valine, leucine, and
isoleucine degradation; starch and sucrose metabolism; secondary metabolite biosynthesis;
and lysine biosynthesis. Furthermore, the downregulated DAMs were primarily enriched
in photosynthesis, photosynthetic antenna proteins, metabolic pathways, cyanogenic amino
acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of various alkaloids. This indicates that drought
stress had different effects on the physicochemical and metabolic processes in the leaves
of the A. odoratissima seedlings. Amino acids play a variety of roles in regulating plant
tolerance to abiotic stress, including roles as osmotic regulators, ROS scavengers, and
precursors of energy-related metabolites [43,44]. In the amino acid metabolism pathway,
drought stress enhanced the relative expression levels of theAoproA and AoOAT genes, and
it increased the arginine (kz000360) and proline (kz000318) contents in the leaves, showing
that drought stress promotes proline biosynthesis by increasing the relative expression
levels of crucial genes in the leaves of A. odoratissima seedlings. Proline can polymerize
with some compounds in the plant cytosol to form hydrophilic colloid-like compounds,
thereby reducing the osmotic pressure and water potential in cells while maintaining the
structural integrity of the cell organism, ultimately improving the drought resistance of A.
odoratissima seedlings [45,46].
Drought stress promotes the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites
in plants, among which alkaloids are important. Alkaloids play crucial roles in the growth
and drought resistance of plants [ 47]; they can interplay with molecules, maintain the
structural stability and activity of macromolecules, and scavenge the ROS induced in
cells to alleviate membrane damage, eventually improving the adaptability and drought
resistance of plants [48–50]. In this study, drought stress increased the relative expression
Plants 2024, 13, 2732 14 of 21
level of AoAOC3 (Aod08G003000/08G003010, AMINE OXIDASE COPPER CONTAINING 3)
and the contents of cadaverine (kz000041), piperidine (kz000229), and the precursor lysine
(kz000339) in the piperine synthesis pathway, suggesting that drought stress promoted the
biosynthesis and accumulation of alkaloids by enhancing the relative expression level of
the AoAOC3 gene in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings. Cadaverine and piperidine
belong to the alkaloid family. Their synthesis and accumulation could increase their
antioxidant capacity, and, together with antioxidases, they could reduce ROS-mediated
oxidative damage, in turn, improving the drought resistance of theA. odoratissima seedlings.
3.4. Identification of Key Transcription Factors in Response to Drought Stress
The key transcription factors in the response to drought stress in the leaves of the A.
odoratissima seedlings were identified using WGCNA technology [51]. Some crucial genes
encoding transcription factors were identified, including the MYB, bHLH, b-ZIP, TCP, and
WRKY families, of which the MYB and bHLH families accounted for the highest number
of genes. Previous results showed that the MYB and bHLH family genes regulated the
biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids and alkaloids, which could remove the ROS in
and mitigate their damage to cells, subsequently enhancing the adaptability and tolerance
of plants under abiotic stress [52,53]. Therefore, we speculate that drought stress improves
the resistance of A. odoratissima seedlings by regulating the expression of key transcription
factors in the leaves. However, the biological functions of these key genes in A. odoratissima
seedlings’ response to drought stress remain unclear, and this will be the focus of our future
research.
Based on these results, a conceptual model of the molecular mechanism of the A.
odoratissima seedlings’ response to drought stress was developed (Figure 7). Briefly, drought
stress reduced the moisture content, total chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity, IAA
and GA contents, SOD activity, and leaf mesophyll and vein thicknesses, but it increased
the MDA content, POD and CAT activities, and proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein
contents, subsequently improving the adaptability and resistance of the A. odoratissima
seedlings. However, drought stress enhanced the relative expression levels of the AoproA,
AoOAT, AopfkA, AoGAPDH, and AoAOC3 genes, and it promoted the biosynthesis and
accumulation of arginine, proline, cadaverine, piperidine, and lysine metabolites, thereby
strengthening the drought tolerance of the A. odoratissima seedlings.
Plants 2024, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 22 
 
 
lysine (kz000339) in the piperine synthesis pa thway, suggesting that drought stress pro-
moted the biosynthesis and accumulation of alkaloids by enhancing the relative expres-
sion level of the AoAOC3 gene in the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings. Cadaverine 
and piperidine belong to the alkaloid family. Their synthesis and accumulation could in-
crease their antioxidant capacity, and, together with antioxidases, they could reduce ROS-
mediated oxidative damage, in turn, improving the drought resistance of the A. odoratis-
sima seedlings.  
3.4. Identiﬁcation of Key Transcription Factors in Response to Drought Stress 
The key transcription factors in the response to drought stress in the leaves of the A. 
odoratissima seedlings were identiﬁed using WGCNA technology [51]. Some crucial genes 
encoding transcription factors were identiﬁed, including the MYB, bHLH, b-ZIP, TCP, and 
WRKY families, of which the MYB and bHLH families accounted for the highest number 
of genes. Previous results showed that the MYB and bHLH family genes regulated the 
biosynthesis and accumulation of ﬂavonoids and alkaloids, which could remove the ROS 
in and mitigate their damage to cells, subsequently enhancing the adaptability and toler-
ance of plants under abiotic stress [52,53]. Therefore, we speculate that drought stress im-
proves the resistance of A. odoratissima seedlings by regulating the expression of key tran-
scription factors in the leaves. However, the biological functions of these key genes in A. 
odoratissima seedlings’ response to drought stress remain unclear, and this will be the fo-
cus of our future research. 
Based on these results, a conceptual model of the molecular mechanism of the A. 
odoratissima seedlings’ response to drought stress was developed (Figure 7). Brie ﬂy, 
drought stress reduced the moisture content, total chlorophyll content, photosynthetic ca-
pacity, IAA and GA contents, SOD activity, and leaf mesophyll and vein thicknesses, but 
it increased the MDA content, POD and CAT activities, and proline, soluble sugar, and 
soluble protein contents, subsequently improving the adaptability and resistance of the A. 
odoratissima seedlings. However, drought stress enhanced the relative expression levels of 
the AoproA, AoOAT, AopfkA, AoGAPDH, and AoAOC3 genes, and it promoted the biosyn-
thesis and accumulation of arginine, proline, cadaverine, piperidine, and lysine metabo-
lites, thereby strengthening the drought tolerance of the A. odoratissima seedlings.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Design of Experiments
4.1.1. Drought-Stressed Environment
A drought stress test was conducted in a greenhouse to avoid the influence of possible
rainfall on the test process, while the air temperature and humidity in the greenhouse were
kept essentially the same as the outdoor environment via artificial adjustment.
4.1.2. Pre-Experiment
In July 2021, five A. odoratissima seedlings were placed in the greenhouse, and artificial
watering was stopped so that the growth and phenotypic changes in the seedlings under
natural drought conditions could be observed and recorded every day. The pre-experiment
results showed that all of the A. odoratissima seedlings died, the leaves dried and withered,
and growth did not resume following re-watering after 22 d of natural drought.
4.1.3. Drought Stress Experiment
Sample trees were collected from a natural forest of A. odoratissima nilotica in the dry–
hot valley area of the Nanpanjiang River (106◦17′1′′ E, 24◦51′47′′ N), with a straight-line
distance of 7 km from the Nanpanjiang River to the sample trees. Young stem segments of
the sample wood were used as propagation materials, and an asexual group of seedlings
was cultivated and used for the drought stress test.
The drought experiment was located at the experimental base of the Guangxi Forestry
Research Institute, under natural light conditions, with an average temperature of 21.6
◦C. The seedling container was a plastic pot with a width of 20 cm, a bottom diameter of
12 cm, and a height of 6.5 cm. The seedling substrate was made according to a yellow heart
soil–coconut husk–cereal husk ratio of 5:3:2, and the weight of the substrate in each pot was
determined to be 1.81 kg, which ensured the normal growth of the seedlings. The average
seedling height was 80.3 cm, and the average diameter was 0.67 cm.
Prior to the drought stress test, the test seedlings received normal daily care to ensure
normal growth. Based on the results of the pre-experiment, the duration of the drought
stress test was set to 20 d, which was divided into four periods of 5 d, 10 d, 15 d, and 20
d. The test groups were divided into control groups (CK5, CK10, CK15, and CK20) and
drought stress treatment groups (T5, T10, T15, and T20), with 60 seedlings in each group,
divided into three biological replications, and sampling was carried out and related indices
calculated at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 d. The drought stress test was terminated after 20 d.
4.2. Measurement of Physiological Indicators
4.2.1. Total Chlorophyll Content in the Leaves
After sample collection, the total chlorophyll content in leaves of A. odoratissima
seedlings was determined using the acetone–ethanol extraction method [54].
4.2.2. Photosynthetic Parameters
Three A. odoratissima seedlings were randomly selected from the control and stress
groups, and each seedling was assigned a number. The transpiration rate (Tr), net photo-
synthetic rate (Pn), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and stomatal conductance (Gs) of
the same-position leaves (counted from the top bud, either the third or fourth) of these num-
bered seedlings were then determined using an Li-6400 photosynthesis system produced
in the United States. The water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated, and then the average
value of each measured index was calculated. A red and blue light source (LI-6400-2B) was
used, and the light intensity and the atmospheric CO 2 concentration ranges were set to
1000 mol/m2/S and 450~500 µmol/mol, respectively. The measurements were performed
within the temperature range of 30~33 ◦C at 8:30~11:30 in the morning every 5 days.
Plants 2024, 13, 2732 16 of 21
4.2.3. Osmosis-Regulating Substances
The proline content in the samples was determined using the acid ninhydrin method.
The concentration of soluble proteins was determined using the Coomassie brilliant blue
method. The amount of soluble sugars was determined using the anthrone colorimetric
method [55].
4.2.4. Enzyme Activity
Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using the thiobarbituric acid method [56].
Peroxidase (POD) activity was measured using the guaiacol colorimetric method. Catalase
(CAT) activity was measured using the ultraviolet absorption method [ 57]. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity was determined using the nitroblue tetrazolium photoreduction
method [58].
4.2.5. Relative Water Content in the Leaves
First, the leaves of the A. odoratissima seedlings collected from the control and stress
groups were cut into small pieces, preheated, and then weighed on a balance. The weight
at this point was denoted as W1. Afterward, the leaves were dried in an oven at 105 ◦C
for 15 min, following which the temperature was reduced to 80 ◦C and maintained until
a constant weight was reached. Finally, after cooling, the dry mass was weighed and
recorded as W2. The relative water content (RWC) was then calculated using the following
formula:
RWC = (W1 − W2)/W1 × 100% (1)
4.2.6. Endogenous Hormones
The levels of gibberellin (GA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), and zeatin riboside (ZR)
were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the double-
antibody sandwich method [59].
4.3. Transcriptome Analysis
The leaf and root tissues of theA. odoratissima seedlings under drought stress and those
of the seedlings in the control group were collected after 0 d, 5 d, 10 d, 15 d, and 20 d. Three
replicates were prepared for each sample. RNA was extracted from these tissue samples us-
ing an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was subjected
to a quality evaluation using an electrophoresis system and an Agilent 2100 (Agilent Tech-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and then used for the preparation of cDNA libraries that
were later sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (NovaSeq 6000, Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) using 150 bp paired-end sequencing. The transcriptome data were evalu-
ated using FastQC, version 0.11.5 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
fastqc/ (accessed on 10 January 2023)), and low-quality reads were filtered out using Trim-
momatic v0.33 software. High-quality reads were aligned to the reference genome of A.
odoratissima using HISAT2, version 2.0.5 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml
(accessed on 3 March 2023)), software. The number of reads aligned to unique positions
was calculated using StringTie (v1.3.3b) software [60], and the expression level of FPKM
was calculated. The gene counts in each sample were normalized using DESeq2, version
1.16.1.t (http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2/ (accessed on 13 April 2023)) (base
mean value for expression estimation). The fold changes were calculated, and the differ-
ential significance of the reads was evaluated using negative binomial distribution (NB)
testing. Finally, the differential protein-coding genes were selected based on the determined
fold changes and the results of the differential significance testing using the criteria of
p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2. A Venn analysis was performed on the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) of different categories, and KEGG and GO enrichment analyses
were performed on the shared DEGs.

4.4. Metabolome Analysis
The leaf tissues of the A. odoratissima seedlings were collected from the drought stress
and control groups after 0 d, 10 d, and 20 d. Three replicates were prepared for each
sample. The leaves were freeze-dried, ground into powder, and subjected to 70% methanol
extraction to obtain metabolites from the samples. A metabolome analysis was performed
using a UPLC-MS/MS system. The chromatographic column used was a Waters ACQUITY
UPLC HSS T3 C18 (1.8 µm, 2.1 mm * 100 mm). The mobile phase comprised ultrapure
water with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B).
The elution gradient was as follows: 0 min, 95% A/5% B; 10.0 min, 5% A/95% B; 11.0 min,
5% A/95% B; 11.1 min, 95% A/5% B; 15.0 min, 95% A/5% B. The source temperature of the
electrospray ionization equipment was set to 550◦C. The mass spectrum equipment voltage
was set to [5500 V (positive), −4500 V (negative)]. The gas ion source I (GS I) was used at
55 psi, gas source II (GS II) was used at 60 psi, and curtain gas (CUR) was used at 25 psi. The
collision-activated dissociation parameters were set to high. In the triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer, each ion pair was scanned and detected based on the optimized declustering
potential and collision energy. The mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Analyst
1.6.3 software. Qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry analyses of the metabolites
extracted from the samples were performed using the local metabolic database. A principal
component analysis of the samples (including quality control samples) was then conducted
for a preliminary assessment of the overall metabolic differences between the groups and
the variability within each group. An orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) was then performed on the metabolites to obtain the variable importance in
projection for the OPLS-DA model. In addition, a univariate analysis was conducted to
determine the differential metabolites based on the established criteria of fold change ≥ 1.5
or fold change ≤ 0.67 and VIP ≥ 0.1.
4.5. Integrated Transcriptome and Metabolome Analysis
An integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis was performed to reveal the
important metabolic pathways involved in the response of this species to drought stress,
and the changes in the important metabolites and genes related to the key enzymes of
these pathways were explored in detail. DEGs and DAMs in metabolic pathways such as
arginine and proline and alkaloids in CK10 vs. T10 and CK20 vs. T20 were standardized
and visualized by TBtools 1.098 and plotted using Adobe illustrator 2022 software.
4.6. WGCNA Co-Expression Network Construction
The expression data from the WGCNA of the leaf tissues of theA. odoratissima seedlings
under drought stress were used to construct a co-expression network using the WGCNA
package in R 4.3.3 software [ 51]. The data on the soluble sugar content, soluble protein
content, gibberellin content, net photosynthesis rate, proline, POD, and CAT enzyme
activity in the A. odoratissima seedlings under drought stress were imported as trait files.
The results were visualized using Cytoscape (v3.7.1) software [61].
4.7. Statistical Analysis
In terms of statistical analyses, the data were collated using WPS Office 12.1.0.17827
software and SPSS 20.0 software for a one-way ANOVA, and the least significant difference
(LSD) method was used for multiple comparisons, with significant differences defined at
p < 0.05. All data are presented as the means ± standard errors of three replicates.
5. Conclusions
In summary, sustained drought stress decreased the moisture content, mesophyll and
vein thicknesses, and photosynthetic capacity in the leaves of A. odoratissima seedlings,
subsequently improving their adaptability. At the same time, drought stress increased the
MDA, proline, soluble sugar, and protein contents, as well as the POD and CAT activities,
in the leaves, thereby improving the drought resistance of the A. odoratissima seedlings.
Plants 2024, 13, 2732 18 of 21
In drought treatment, a total of 1194 DEGs and 371 DAMs were identified. These were
mainly annotated in the amino acid and alkaloid metabolism pathways, in which the
arginine, proline, lysine, cadaverine, and piperidine metabolite contents were increased
and the relative expression levels of the AoproA, AoOAT, AopfkA, AoGAPDH, and AoAOC3
genes were upregulated. This indicates that drought stress promoted the biosynthesis
and accumulation of amino acids and alkaloids by increasing the expression of key genes
in metabolic pathways, suggesting that these predominant metabolites may improve the
drought tolerance of A. odoratissima seedlings. Furthermore, some crucial transcription
factors were identified using WGCNA technology. These results suggest thatA. odoratissima
seedlings respond to drought stress mainly by improving the capacities of the antioxidant
system and secondary metabolism.
