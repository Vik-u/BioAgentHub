With the advent of the industrial revolution, the use of toxic compounds has grown
exponentially, leading to a considerable pollution of the environment. Consequently, the
development of more environmentally conscious technologies is an urgent need. Industrial
biocatalysis appears as one potential solution, where a higher demand for more robust
enzymes aims to replace toxic chemical catalysts. To date, most of the commercially
available enzymes are of mesophilic origin, displaying optimal activity in narrow ranges of
temperature and pH (i.e., between 20
°C and 45°C, neutral pH), limiting their actual
application under industrial reaction settings, where they usually underperform,
requiring larger quantities to compensate loss of activity. In order to obtain novel
biocatalysts better suited for industrial conditions, an ef ﬁcient solution is to take
advantage of nature by searching and discovering enzymes from extremophiles. These
microorganisms and their macromolecules have already adapted to thrive in environments
that present extreme physicochemical conditions. Hence, extremophilic enzymes stand
out for showing higher activity, stability, and robustness than their mesophilic counterparts,
being able to carry out reactions at nonstandard conditions. In this brief research report we
describe three examples to illustrate a stepwise strategy for the development and
production of commercial extremozymes, including a catalase from an Antarctic
psychrotolerant microorganism, a laccase from a thermoalkaliphilic bacterium isolated
from a hot spring and an amine-transaminase from a thermophilic bacterium isolated from
a geothermal site in Antarctica. We will also explore some of their interesting
biotechnological applications and comparisons with commercial enzymes.

INTRODUCTION
The development of the biotechnology industry and the interest for greener and environmentally
friendly technologies has led to an increasing demand for more efﬁcient and less contaminant
catalysts. Consequently, the global enzymes market has grown from US$2 billion in 2004 (Joseph
et al., 2008), to $8.63 billion in 2019, and is expected to reach $14.5 billion by 2027 (Manjrekar and
Wadekar, 2021). However, one of the main problems of using biocatalysts in industrial applications
are the harsh conditions at which industrial processes usually take place. Under these settings,
mesophilic enzymes that are currently the great majority of commercially available biocatalysts,

perform poorly and require larger quantities to compensate for
the loss of activity. Therefore, there is a great interest for more
stable and efﬁcient biocatalysts, better suited to work optimally at
these extreme conditions ( Atalah et al., 2019 ). This can be
addressed via protein engineering of mesophilic enzymes,
combining rational and computational design with directed
evolution, to achieve the selectivity, catalytic ef ﬁciency and
stability required for their industrial use, or by taking
advantage of what is already available in Nature.
Extremophilic microorganisms and their macromolecules
have already adapted to thrive in environments that present
extreme physicochemical conditions. Extremozymes have
adapted to optimally perform at, or close to the environmental
conditions where extremophilic microorganisms inhabit (e.g.,
high or low temperatures, acidic or alkaline pH, high pressure,
salinity, radiation) (Brininger et al., 2018). These novel extreme
biocatalysts with increased stability to denaturing conditions,
stand out for being highly efﬁcient, showing higher activity,
and robustness than their mesophilic counterparts, being able
to carry out reactions at nonstandard conditions, producing low
amounts of by-products under a wide range of extreme industrial
settings (Gomes and Steiner, 2004; Cáceres-Moreno et al., 2019).
To date, there are two main approaches to discover novel
extremozymes from environmental samples. On one hand, due to
the inherent difﬁculty and speciﬁc requirements of in vitro
culturing of extremophilic microorganisms, especially archaea,
there is a culture independent approach, which is based on
metagenomic sequencing followed by data mining to search
for speciﬁc genes that potentially codify for an enzyme of
interest (Sysoev et al., 2021). However, one disadvantage of
this strategy is that to date, there is a lack of reliable
functional annotation of extremophile genomic data, caused
by the low amount of experimentally described genes. This
translates in a shortfall of speciﬁc databases, with many genes
getting annotated as hypothetical proteins with unknown
functions, contributing to the problem of information shortage.
On the other hand, there is a culture dependent functional
approach that allows to obtain native extremozymes able to
catalyze reactions of interest at the desired conditions. For
this, extremophiles are grown and isolated under the required
selective pressures and then, enzymatic activity-based screening
are performed to select the most promising ones for further
studies.
After ﬁnding novel industrially relevant extremozymes by any
of these two approaches, it is necessary to produce them in high
amounts to obtain a commercial enzyme product that could be
useful for biotechnological applications. Therefore, it is required
to develop the recombinant version of the native enzyme of
interest by cloning and expressing its coding gene in a suitable
heterologous host-vector system, which allows to obtain higher
productivity in shorter periods of time. Then, the recombinant
extremophilic enzyme functionally overexpressed needs to be
biochemically characterized. Finally, it is necessary to perform
growth optimization for quality-controlled scale-up and
downstream processing (Figure 1).
Here we describe a stepwise strategy based on the culture
dependent functional approach, for the discovery, development,
scale-up and production of three novel industrially relevant
extremozyme products for the Research Market: a catalase, a
laccase and an amine transaminase. The experimental work was
carried out at Fundacion Biociencia, a Chilean non-pro ﬁt
scientiﬁc research institution, with over 20 years of experience
dedicated to the study of extremophilic microorganisms and their
bio-compounds.
METHODS
Phase 1: Discovery of Extremophiles with
Industrially Relevant Enzyme Activities
Environmental samples collected during different Scienti ﬁc
Expeditions to extreme sites are selected according to
physicochemical characteristics required for a speci ﬁc
industrial process. Considering the nature of the samples and
their original conditions, they are inoculated in different culture
media applying speciﬁc selection pressures to enrich the culture
with microorganisms with the desired characteristics. To this end,
because of the growing demand for highly active catalases,
microorganisms naturally exposed to environmental stresses
that trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species (i.e., low
temperatures, high UV radiation) were selected and functionally
screened, since they must have an important antioxidant defense
mechanism (such as an active catalase) to deal with those extreme
conditions. Similarly, because thermostable and thermoactive
laccases and amine-transaminases are currently largely
required by several industries, thermophilic microorganisms
from different extreme environments were selected and
functionally screened for these enzyme activities.
- Psychrotolerant catalase producing microorganisms were
screened in environmental samples collected from Elephant
Island, Antarctica. Samples were cultivated at 8
°C and pH 6.5
for up to 2 weeks. Then, cultures were exposed to UV-C
radiation in a specially designed dark chamber for 2 h, to
enrich microorganisms with better antioxidant defense
mechanisms (Monsalves et al., 2020).
- Thermoalkaliphilic laccase producing microorganisms were
searched in environmental samples collected from a
geothermal site and cultivated at 50
°C, pH 8.0 in media
supplemented with lignin as an inductor of laccase activity.
Then, functional screening was performed using agar plates
containing 0.5 mM guaiacol for easy identiﬁcation of laccase
positive brown colored colonies (Sheikhi et al., 2012).
- Thermophilic amine-transaminase producing
microorganisms were screened in environmental samples
collected from fumaroles located in Whalers Bay, Deception
Island, Antarctica. Samples were cultivated at 50
°C and pH 7.6
for 24 h in media supplemented with 10 mM
α-methylbenzylamine (MBA) as an inductor of amine-
transaminase activity (Márquez and Blamey, 2019).
Extremophiles that were able to grow under the determined
conditions were isolated through several rounds of serial dilutions
to extinction, in conjunction with spread-plate techniques until a

single morphotype was observed. Isolated strains were
maintained by routinely sub-culturing in fresh growth medium
and as 20% glycerol suspension stored at−80
°C. Subsequently, a
polyphasic approach was used to identify the isolated
microorganisms (Ramasamy et al., 2014). In addition, whole
genome sequencing of the most promising extremophiles was
performed on Illumina Miseq platform using Nextera XT DNA
libraries at Georgia Genomics Facility (Georgia, United States).
The sequenced genomes were assembled, curated and annotated
at Fundacion Biociencia. Then, identiﬁcation of the catalase,
laccase and amine-transaminase encoding genes was done
through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the genome
sequence of each selected extremophilic microorganism.
Phase 2: Development of the Recombinant
Versions of Native Extremozymes
Cloning, overexpression and downstream processing is
somehow different for every protein. As general
considerations, when aiming to develop an enzyme product,
selecting an unpatented expression vector/host is relevant in
order to prevent infringement of intellectual property.
Similarly, the utilization of af ﬁnity tags for easier
puriﬁcation, or fusion partners for increased solubility, is
not recommended due to their use is often licensed for
commercial purposes. Furth ermore, selection of the cell
location for heterologous expression, needs to consider the
culture volumen and the laboratory equipment available, either
for cell disruption and fractionation, in the case of intracellular
overexpression, or for supernatant concentration when
extracellular. For recombinant ex p r e s s i o ni nt h ew e l l - k n o w n ,
mesophilic heterologous host Escherichia coli , catalase and
laccase encoding genes were PCR-ampli ﬁed from their
native microorganism ’s genomic DNA using speci ﬁc
oligonucleotide primers, while amine-transaminase was
codon optimized and synthesized by Atum (California,
United States) ( Márquez and Blamey, 2019 ; Espina et al.,
2021b). Then, they were cloned into expression vectors
characterized for carrying IPTG-inducible T5 promoter and
kanamycin antibiotic resistance gene for selection, with neither
afﬁnity tags nor signal peptide for extracellular secretion.
E. colicompetent cells were chemically transformed with each
expression vector carrying the sequence veri ﬁed genes. The
selected transformants were grown aerobically at 37
°C, with
shaking at 180 rpm until OD600 /equals0.6–0.8, in 50 ml LB
medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin, plus 2 mM
CuSO4 in the case of laccase. At this point, the heterologous
expression of the recombinant enzymes was induced by the
addition of 0.1–0.5 mM IPTG and the cultures were further
incubated at 30
°C for 6 –12 h. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 9000 g for 15 min at 4°C and resuspended in
5 ml lysis buffer. Then, cell disruption was carried out by ten 15 s
bursts of sonication (Branson Soniﬁer 450), and the cell lysate was
centrifuged at 14000 g for 30 min at 4
°C in order to obtain the
soluble crude extract. Extremozyme ’s overexpression was
evaluated by SDS-PAGE ( Gallagher and Sasse, 1998 ) and
speciﬁc enzyme assays:
- Catalase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by
monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm, due to the
transformation of H
2O2 to H2O and O2. The reaction mixture
for the standard assay contained 10 mM H2O2 and 50 mM

potassium phosphate pH 7.0, in a total volume of 3 ml. One
unit of catalase activity was deﬁned as the decomposition of
1 µmol of H2O2 per minute (Beers and Sizer, 1952).
- Laccase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically
following the oxidation of syringaldazine substrate to
tetramethoxy-azo-bis-methylene-quinone (II) at 530 nm.
The reaction mixture for the standard assay contained
0.216 mM syringaldazine and 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer pH 6.0 in a total volume of 3 ml. One unit of laccase
activity was deﬁned as a change in absorbance at 530 nm of
0.001 per minute, under the assay conditions (Lante et al.,
2000).
- Amine-transaminase activity toward (S)- α-MBA was
measured spectrophotometrically following the
acetophenone formation at 245 nm ( ε /equals12 mM
−1 cm−1)
The reaction mixture for the standard assay contained
1 mM (S)-α methylbenzylamine, 1 mM pyruvate and 10μM
PLP and 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 in a total volume of
1 ml. One unit of amine-transaminase activity was deﬁned as
the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1μmol
acetophenone from (S)- α-MBA and pyruvate in 1 min
(Schätzle et al., 2009).
Protein concentration was measured by Bradford method,
using a commercially assay kit (Bio-Rad, California,
United States).
The recombinant catalase, laccase and amine-transaminase
overexpressed in functional, soluble form with no afﬁnity tags
were puriﬁed by anion exchange chromatography at room
temperature on an ÄKTA Pure FPLC system (GE Healthcare).
The soluble crude extracts were diluted 10-fold in loading buffer
and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 25 ml Q-sepharose XK 16/20
column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV)
of the same buffer, followed by a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 M) for
protein elution.
Studies on the pH and temperature dependence were made for
each puriﬁed recombinant protein in order to biochemically
characterize them in terms of optimum pH, optimum
temperature and thermostability.
Phase 3: Optimization and Scale-up of the
Biomass and Protein
After obtaining the recombinant extremozymes of interest
overexpressed in functional and soluble form, it was necessary
to optimize its production at laboratory scale in order to obtain
better biomass and protein yields for downstream analyses. This
optimization process was done in 250 mlﬂasks and also in a 5L
Biostat B-plus bioreactor (Sartorius). The most common
parameters to optimize in order to ensure satisfactory levels of
biomass and protein overexpression during the production of
recombinant extremozymes are: Culture media, pH, growth
temperature, agitation rate, aeration, inoculum volume,
optimum fermentation volume, culture time, antibiotic
concentration, as well as inductor concentration, time, and
temperature of induction ( Steinberg and Bursztyn, 2010 ;
Espina et al., 2020).
To determine the optimal parameters, statistical tools such as
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to assess if there were
signiﬁcant differences between the studied factors. In addition,
the complementary methodologies: Design of Experiments
(DoE) (Mandenius and Brundin, 2008) and Response Surface
Methodology (RSM) (Myers and Montgomery, 2016), were used
to avoid experimental biases and reduce the number of
experiments needed to achieve optimal conditions. DoE was
used to obtain a matrix of experiments that allow varying more
than one variable at the same time, and RSM allowed the
analysis of the results obtained from the designed matrix,
enabling the study of how the interactions between the input
variables inﬂuence the output responses. Statgraphics Software
(Virginia, United States) was used to determine the DoE and to
a n a l y z et h es u r f a c eo fr e s p o n s eu s i n gt h eb i o m a s sy i e l da n d
enzyme activity in order toﬁnd the optimal conditions for each
of the different enzymes. The combination of the parameters
that allow to achieve the highest yield of biomass and
recombinant enzyme were successfully determined for
catalase and laccase, while for the amine-transaminase these
experiments are currently ongoing. When using DoE and RSM
methods, the obtained data are evaluated and analyzed to
determine if there are signi ﬁcant differences between them
and thus, validate if the method was successfully optimized
or not. All analyses were carried out using a conﬁdence interval
of 95%, which allows to observe signiﬁcant differences between
biomass production, an indicator of a successful optimization.
After the process was optimized for catalase and laccase
expression using bench scale reactors, the cultures were then
scaled-up in order to replicate the behavior and results obtained
in laboratory scale. Usually this increase corresponds to a volume
ratio of 1/10 for a consecutive scaled-up (Votruba and Sobotka,
1992). Also, it is important to maintain the same conditions
determined during the optimization and to use bioreactors that
maintain geometrical similarity, and constant relations in their
dimensions and lengths. The scale-up was considered to be
completed when the yield of biomass and enzymes was similar
in different scales and this was reproducible.
Then, the scaled-up cells were harvested by centrifugation at
9000 g, and disrupted using a high-pressure homogenizer
(Constant Systems Cell Disruptor). The crude extract was
obtained after ultracentrifugation at 30000 g for 20 min at 4
°C.
Due to their extremophilic origin an thermal stability, the
intracellularly overexpressed catalase and laccase were puriﬁed
using a heat shock process ﬁrst, optimized in time and
temperature using multifactorial ANOVA. This ﬁrst
puriﬁcation step allows efﬁcient separation from many native
E. coli proteins that precipitate with increased temperatures.
Then, anion exchange chromatography was used as a second
step of puriﬁcation following the protocol previously described,
using a 450 ml Q-sepharose resin in XK 50/60 column. It is
important to mention that the ﬁnal purity required for a
commercial extremozyme product is directly related to its
target applications.
Stability studies of the puriﬁed recombinant proteins were
made by assaying enzyme activity in time, at two different storage
temperatures: 4
°C and−20°C. These experiments were made for
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 7522814
Espina et al. Roadmap to an Extremozyme Product
each protein in solution and also as lyophilized powder as this
format could offer easier transportation and sometimes better
stability than liquid format.
Phase 4: Obtaining the Enzyme Product
Achieving reproducibility in each batch in relation to biomass
and/or protein production is very important, as the whole
process must be validated to ensure that it will consistently
generate a product meeting its predetermined speciﬁcations.
Hence, after successful scale-up, it was necessary to
determine and assess quality control points (QCP) in order
to obtain a ﬁnal product with a reproducible quality
(Nummer et al., 2015 ; Table 1 ). If the ﬁnal product
complies with the Quality Control Certi ﬁcate parameters
and Product Datasheet speci ﬁcations, it is labeled and
delivered with all the necessary paperwork (e.g., Analysis
Certi ﬁcate, Material Safety Data Sheet and Certi ﬁcate of
Origin) to a ﬁn a lu s e ro ra na p p r o p r i a t ed i s t r i b u t o rf o ri t s
commercialization ( Espina et al., 2020).
Comparison with other Commercial
Enzymes
The lyophilized commercial product enz_cat_004 (Swissaustral)
was compared with other commercial enzymes: catalase from
Aspergillus niger (Sigma C3515) and catalase from bovine liver
(Sigma C40). Each enzyme was assayed as described above, at
different temperatures, between 20
°C and 70°C, at their optimum
pH reported by each manufacturer in their data sheets.
The lyophilized commercial product enz_lac_005
(Swissaustral) was compared with other commercial enzymes:
Laccase from Aspergillus sp. (Sigma SAE0050), laccase from
Aspergillus oryzea (Novozym 51003) and laccase from
Trametes versicolor (Sigma 38429). Each enzyme was assayed
at different temperatures, between 20
°C and 80 °C, at their
optimum pH reported by each manufacturer in their data sheets.
RESULTS
Catalase
Catalases (EC 1.11.1.6) are enzymes that act on hydrogen
peroxide as an acceptor, characterized by utilizing a second
H
2O2 molecule as the electron donor, to catalyze its
dismutation into H 2O and O 2 without consuming cellular
reducing equivalents (Heck et al., 2010). These enzymes have
various biotechnological applications as hydrogen peroxide is
extensively used as a powerful oxidizing, bleaching, or sterilizing
agent by many industries, including food, textile, pulp and paper,
biomedicine, clinical diagnostic, bioremediation ( Lončar and
Fraaije, 2015; Espina et al., 2021a).
After functional screening, a psychrotolerant and radiation
resistant bacterium was isolated from environmental samples
collected from Elephant Island, Antarctica. This microorganism
was identiﬁed as Serratia sp. I1P, with optimal growth conditions
at 22
°C, pH 7.0–9.0, 2–6% NaCl (Monsalves et al., 2020). An o v e l
catalase was puriﬁed from the crude extract and biochemically
characterized. The native enzyme was active in a wide range of
temperatures (20–70°C), showing optimal activity at 50°C and pH 7.0,
with a half-life of 7 h when incubated at 50°C, which is remarkable
considering its psychrotolerant origin (Monsalves et al., 2020).
Optimization of the recombinant overexpression of this
enzyme showed that the best growth conditions were REC-P
culture medium, at 23
°C, pH 7.0, 15% pO2 concentration and
16 h cultivation. The optimal culture medium and physico-
chemical conditions were determined during the optimization
phase done in 5L Biostat B-plus bioreactor, and then scale-up
was done in pilot scale using a 40L Biostat C-plus bioreactor
(Sartorius).
A comparison of the results of biomass yield, enzymatic yield,
and speciﬁc activity obtained during each step of the catalase
product development is presented inTable 2. The optimized and
scale-up recombinant expression allow to raise up the values of
activity over 6 times, biomass production increaseﬁvefold and
enzyme production over 50 times.
The quality control system was applied in every step of the
process, which allows to obtain aﬁnal enzymatic product with
constant reproducibility. Furthermore, stability tests performed
showed that at 4
°C, the liquid enzyme product maintained more
than 60% of its activity after 260 days and more than 80% of its
activity after 320 days when stored at−20°C. The lyophilized
enzyme kept the reported activity (>8000 U/mg) at least 2 years,
stored at −20°C.
This novel thermostable catalase from psychrotolerant origin
is currently commercially available as an enzyme product from
Swissaustral LLC. Currently, it is available in two formats: liquid
(enz_cat_001) and lyophilized (enz_cat_004) with≥65000 U/ml
and ≥8000 U/mg, respectively.
The comparison of the lyophilized product (enz_cat_004)
with two other commercial catalases from fungal and bovine
origin (Figure 2A), proved that the catalase enzyme, discovered,
and developed at Fundacion Biociencia is highly active in a
broad range of temperatures (20
°C— 70°C). This novel
extremozyme product is a promising candidate for potential

biotechnological applications, as it is better suited than
mesophilic enzymes to resist the harsh conditions found in
many industrial processes. Unfortunately, commercial catalases
as most enzymatic products available on the market, do not
report information regarding their purity that could allow
further comparisons between products. The catalase product
from Swissaustral is currently commercialized at a purity of at
least 53% ( Supplementary Table S1 ) for biotechnological
applications. Additionally, its purity level could be increased
up to 95% if required for a speci ﬁc application, such as
biomedical and clinical diagnostic.
Laccase
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), are enzymes that catalyze the
oxidation of a wide array of phenolic and non-phenolic
compounds, only requiring oxygen as co-substrate and
releasing water as the sole by-product ( Riva, 2006). Due to
their broad substrate range, versatility and ease of use, laccases
have great biotechnological potential and are useful in many
applications such as: Food industry (Osma et al., 2010), pulp
and paper ( Singh and Arya, 2019 ), organic synthesis
(Mogharabi and Faramarzi, 2014 ), bioremediation ( Strong
and Claus, 2011 ), biofuels ( Kudanga and Le Roes-Hill,
2014), textile industry (Rodríguez Couto and Toca Herrera,
2006), biomedical and pharmaceuticals ( M o h i te ta l . ,2 0 2 0),
and biosensors (Castrovilli et al., 2019).
After functional screening, a thermoalkaliphilic spore-
forming bacterium was isola ted from an environmental
sample obtained from a hot sp ring in a geothermal site.
This microorganism was identi ﬁed as Bacillus sp. FNT,
with optimal growth conditions at 50
°C, pH 8.0. A novel
laccase was found in the spores, and it was successfully
puriﬁed and biochemically characterized. The recombinant
version of this enzyme exhibits remarkably high speci ﬁc
activity at 70
°C, pH 6.0, and is active in a wide range of
temperature (20 –90°C) with a half-life of 3 h when incubated
at 60°C( Espina et al., 2021a).
Optimization of the recombinant overexpression, showed that
the best growth conditions were TBA culture medium
supplemented with 2 mM CuSO4,a t3 0°C, pH 7.0, 15% of pO2
concentration and 23 h cultivation. The optimal culture medium
and physico-chemical conditions were determined during the
optimization phase done in 5L Biostat B-plus bioreactor, and then
scale-up was done in pilot scale using a 40L Biostat C-plus
bioreactor.
A comparison of the results of biomass yield, enzymatic yield
and speciﬁc activity obtained during each step of the laccase
product development is presented inTable 2. The optimized and
scale-up recombinant expression raise up the values of activity
over 300 times, biomass production increase 2.5 times and
enzyme production over hundredfold.
The quality control system wasapplied in every step of the
process, which allows to obtain aﬁnal enzymatic product with
constant reproducibility. Furthermore, stability tests
performed showed that the lyophilized enzyme product
maintained the same reported activity at least for 11 months
at −20
°C. This novel thermostable laccase from
thermoalkaliphilic origin is cu rrently commercially available
as an enzyme product from Swissaustral LLC. At the moment, it
is available only in lyophilized format (enz_lac_005) with
≥300000 U/mg. Stability tests of liquid format are currently
under evaluation.
The comparison of the product (enz_lac_005) with three
other commercial laccases from fungal origin available in the
market ( Figure 2B ), proved that the laccase enzyme
discovered and developed at Fundacion Biociencia is highly
active in a broad range of temperatures, conﬁrming that this
novel extremozyme product is a promising candidate for
potential biotechnological app lications. Swissaustral laccase
is currently commercialized at a purity of at least 78%
(Supplementary Table S1).
Amine-transaminase
Transaminases (EC 2.6.1. X), are a large pyridoxal 5’-phosphate
dependent group of enzymes capable of catalyzing the
stereoselective reversible transfer of an amino group from a
donor substrate to the carbonyl carbon atom of an acceptor
substrate (Ferrandi and Monti, 2018 ). Amine-transaminases

FIGURE 2 |Comparison of commercial catalases(A) and laccases(B) at different temperatures. Each commercial enzyme was assayed at their optimum pH, as
reported by each manufacturer in their data sheets. The enzyme assays used were described in the method section for each enzyme. One unit (U) of CAT activity was
deﬁned as the decomposition of 1 µmol of H2O2 per minute. One unit (U) of laccase activity was deﬁned as a change in absorbance at 530 nm of 0.001 per minute, under
the assay conditions. Error bars indicate standard deviation of triplicate measurements.

(ATA) are a subgroup of ω-transaminases enzymes with the
ability to perform reductive amination on prochiral ketones using
a wide range of primary amine donors and acceptors.
Consequently, these enzymes are of great industrial interest
especially for the pharmaceutical, ﬁne chemicals and
agrochemical industries, since they are a promising alternative
to replace the enantioselective chemical synthesis of optically
pure chiral amines, which is currently done using transition
metals as catalysts (Ferrandi and Monti, 2018; Kelly et al., 2020).
After functional screening of transaminase activity, a
thermophilic bacterium was isolated from an environmental
sample collected from coastal fumaroles emerging at the shore
at Whalers Bay in Deception Island, Antarctica. This
microorganism was identi ﬁed as Albidovulum sp. SLM16,
with optimal growth conditions at 55
°C, pH 6.5–8.0, 1–3%
NaCl (Márquez and Blamey, 2019). A novel (S)-ATA enzyme
was puri ﬁed from the crude extract and biochemically
characterized. The recombinant version of this enzyme has
been obtained with a purity of 99.7% (Supplementary Table
S1), and found to be active in a wide range of temperatures
(20–70
°C), showing optimal activity at 65°C and pH 9.5, with a
remarkable thermostability maintaining 80% of its speci ﬁc
activity after 5 days of incubation at 50 °C( Marquez and
Blamey, 2019).
The optimal culture medium for this enzyme overexpression
was determined to be TBA. Further optimization of the growth
conditions for recombinant overexpression of this enzyme is
currently ongoing for subsequent scale-up.
A comparison of the results of biomass yield, enzymatic yield and
speciﬁc activity obtained during the ATA development is presented
in Table 2. The non-optimized recombinant expression raises up the
values of activity over 11 times, biomass production increases over
3.5 times and doubles the enzyme production. These are very
promising results indicating that there is still room for
improvement after optimization leading to scale-up of enzyme
production. The quality control system has to be applied in every
step of the process in order to obtain theﬁnal enzymatic product
with constant reproducibility. Then, stability tests at different storage
temperatures in time, and comparison with another commercial
ATA will also be performed before obtaining theﬁnal enzyme
product.
To date, advances are being consistently made in order to
develop this industrially relevant, thermophilic and highly
thermostable ATA, as a commercial extremozyme product in
the near future.
CONCLUSION
In the increasing need to replace toxic chemical catalysis for
biocatalysis, enzymes derived from microorganisms isolated from
extreme environments have called the attention. Their
remarkable properties allow them to carry out reactions under
nonstandard conditions, being highly suitable for industry.
Consequently, the search and discovery of novel enzymes will
drive future biotechnological innovation improving current
industrial processes.
Even though culture independent bioprospection based on
metagenomic sequencing and analysis might help to obtain novel
enzyme products in a faster way, many times when interesting
encoding genes are selected directly from the genome sequence,
there is a risk that they would not necessarily display the desired
activity when heterologously overexpressed. Undoubtedly, one of
the main advantages of the classic functional approach is that it
ensures that there is actually an enzyme with the desired
characteristics being functionally expressed in the native
microorganism. This increases the probability of producing a
recombinant version of the enzyme that keeps similar
characteristics to the native one. As presented in this brief
research report, using a stepwise strategy based on a culture
dependent functional approach, has successfully led to the
development of interesting extremozyme commercial products
from environmental samples.
