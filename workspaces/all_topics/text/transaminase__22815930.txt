Abstract
The magnetic chitosan nanocomposites have been studied intensively and been used practically in various biomedical and
biological applications including enzyme immobilization. However, the loading capacity and the remained activity of
immobilized enzyme based on existing approaches are not satisfied. Simpler and more effective immobilization strategies
are needed. Here we report a simple catechol modified protocol for preparing a novel catechol-chitosan (CCS) - iron oxide
nanoparticles (IONPs) composites carrying adhesive moieties with strong surface affinity. Thev-transaminase (v-TA) was
immobilized onto this magnetic composite via nucleophilic reactions between catechol and v-TA. Under optimal
conditions, 87.5% of the availablev-TA was immobilized on the composite, yielding an enzyme loading capacity as high as
681.7 mg/g. Furthermore, the valuation of enzyme activity showed that v-TA immobilized on CCS-IONPs displayed
enhanced pH and thermal stability compared to free enzyme. Importantly, the immobilizedv-TA retained more than 50% of
its initial activity after 15 repeated reaction cycles using magnetic separation and 61.5% of its initial activity after storage at
4uC in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 days. The results suggested that such adhesive magnetic composites may
provide an improved platform technology for bio-macromolecules immobilized.

Introduction
Chitosan (CS), a linear amino polysaccharide, is derived from
chitin which is found in abundance in nature [1]. CS has been widely
applied in food and pharmaceutical industries due to its unique
characteristics such as non-toxicity, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, physiological inertness and high mechanical
strength [2]. In recent years, the magnetic CS nanocomposites, as a
special functional material, have attracted much attention and been
applied in loading of biomolecules [3], biosensor [4], metal
adsorption [5], drug/gene delivery [6], and MRI [7].
Generally, the CS-IONPs composites were synthesized using
microemulsion polymerization, in situ polymerization and sus-
pension cross-linking method [8]. Several new methods have
recently been developed to synthesize CS-IONPs composites using
IONPs covalently attached on the amine groups of CS for various
applications [9,10]. However, for immobilization of enzyme onto
CS-IONPs composites, although the capacity of enzyme via
covalently linking is more than via electrostatic attraction
absorption [11,12], the loading capacity and the remained activity
of enzyme are not satisfied as expected using glutaraldehyde as
coupling reagent. One main reason may be that glutaraldehyde
has an aldehyde group on both ends of the molecular which can
simultaneously react with the amine group of CS in the typical
glutaraldehyde activation procedure. This side reaction reduces
the number of CS-IONPs composites reaction with enzyme.
Furthermore, glutaraldehyde can cause denaturation and distor-
tion of most enzymes due to the same reaction between aldehyde
groups of glutaraldehyde and amine groups of enzyme.
Herein, inspired by adhesive proteins secreted by marine
mussels (Mytilus edulis) [13], we developed a new strategy of using
catechol (ortho-dihydroxyphenyl) modified chitosan (CCS) to
prepare CCS-IONPs composites to form adhesive surface as
linking agent for immobilizing enzyme. CCS which containing
both catechol and primary amine was synthesized using 3, 4-
dihydroxybenzaldehyde to react with the amine groups of CS to
form Schiff base in acid solution. Catechol is the functional group
of 3, 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) which is abundantly
found in the mussel adhesive proteins [14]. It forms strong bonds
with various inorganic/organic surfaces in aqueous media [15].In
this study, the adhesive CCS-IONPs composites were prepared
and used to immobilizev-TA. We choosev-TA because it is an
important kind of enzyme with a variety of applications in
pharmaceutical industry [16,17]. Enhanced activity and operation
stability of v-TA could be achieved more efficiently and
conveniently by immobilization.

was synthesized by Bosch reduction of Schiff base that results from
the reaction of CS and 3, 4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde. The degree
of substitution of CS was calculated from the
1H-NMR spectrum
(Figure S1) of CCS. In this reaction condition, the degree of
substitution was 52.2%.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the IONPs
and composites are shown in Figure 2. Whereas the IONPs
contain little carbon and nitrogen content (Figure 2A), the XPS
spectrum of CS-IONPs composites contain prominent peaks
correlating to C1s (284.5 eV) and N1s (399.5 eV). In the CCS-
IONPs composites’ XPS spectrum (Figure 2C), however, the C1s
and O1s signals become complex and are peak-fitted into 2 to 3
components, respectively. The C1s peak in 292.5 eV is due to the
p-p* transition of aromatic carbons [18], which proves presence of
aromatic carbons. The nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) ratio of CCS-
IONPs composites decreases obviously compared with CS-IONPs
composites. Additionally, the Fe 2 p peaks become very weak in
CCS-IONPs composites compared to IONPs due to surface
coating. Further evidence for CCS coating is provided by a shift of
the O1s peak from 529.5 eV in IONPs corresponding to iron
oxide to 532 eV corresponding to organic oxygen.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 3) on the IONPs
and composites show that the weight of all samples begins to
decrease from 105uC due to the evaporation of bound water. The
weight of IONPs becomes stable when above 410uC with a final
12.1% weight loss. However, the weight of the composites
continues to decrease due to the evaporation of bound water
and thermal decomposition of moisture in the glycosyl of CS. A
very quick weight loss is observed from 620uC to 660uC in CCS-
IONPs composites which is presumed resulted from the pyrolysis
of benzene ring of catechol moieties. The finally weight loss of CS-
IONPs composites and CCS-IONPs composites is 36% and 57%,
indicating that the mass ratios of CS and CCS is 24% and 45% in
composites, respectively.
The size and morphology of IONPs and composites were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission

reduction of Schiff base that results from the reaction of CS and 3, 4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde. The adhesive CCS-IONPs composites were prepared by
mixing CCS solution with IONPs and adjusting the pH of solution to neutral. Enzyme was immobilized onto the adhesive CCS-IONPs composites via
nucleophilic reactions between catechol and enzyme.

electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 4). SEM and TEM images
show that the CS-IONPs composites have a porous framework
that the IONPs are well dispersed and cross-linked in the CS
without any indications of massive agglomeration. Compared to
the CS-IONPs composites, the morphology of the CCS-IONPs
composites is obviously different. The IONPs agglomerate and are
encapsulated tightly by CCS. TEM images show that the IONPs
were composed of clusters of nanoparticles with sizes ranging from
5 nm to 10 nm. The particle size distribution of the IONPs and
composites was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Figure 5A). The average size of the CS-IONPs and CCS-IONPs
clusters is about 750 nm, larger than as-synthesized IONPs
clusters (average diameter 170 nm).
The CCS-IONPs composites exhibit highly responsive to a
magnetic field (Figure 5B), the solution became clear within one
minute as a result of movement of the CCS-IONPs composites
towards a magnet. The composites were re-suspended in water
after removing the magnet followed by agitation. These demon-
strate that CCS-IONPs composites disperse well in water and can
be simply and rapidly separated from solution by a magnet.

Immobilization of v-TA onto the CCS-IONPs Composites
XPS spectrum of thev-TA immobilized CCS-IONPs compos-
ites (Figure 2D) shows an increase in N/C ratio (0.153) compared
to CCS-IONPs (0.038). However, the morphology of the CCS-
IONPs composites shows no any change after immobilization of
v-TA (Figure 4D).
Table 1 summarizes the immobilization efficiency and the
specific activity of the v-TA immobilized onto the composites.
The CCS-IONPs display higher enzyme loading capacity than
IONPs and CS-IONPs. The amount ofv-TA immobilized onto
CCS-IONPs composites was 681.7 mg/g, 3.5-fold of that onto
IONPs and over 6-fold of that onto CS-IONPs composites. The
specific activity ofv-TA immobilized on CCS-IONPs composites
was 7.79 U/mg which retained 87.5% of the initial activity of the
free v-TA (8.64 U/mg).
Stability and Reusability of the Immobilizedv-TA
The effects of pH and temperature on the activity of free and
immobilized v-TA are shown in Figure 6. The activity of both free
and immobilized v-TA is mildly affected at temperatures below
37uC (Figure 6A). However, the relative activity of free v-TA
decreased significantly above 37uC which retained 36% of the
initial activity at 50uC, whereas the immobilizedv-TA retained as
high as 62%.
Compared to the freev-TA, more activity of the immobilized
v-TA was retained after incubated at a wider pH range. As shown
in Figure 6B, the activity of the immobilized v-TA decreased
slightly at pH 7–9, and retained 53% and 51% of initial activity
after 24 hours incubation at pH 6 and 10, respectively. However,
the activity of the freev-TA has a noticeable reduction after 24
hours incubation at pH 8 and pH 9 which retained 73% and 60%
of the initial activity. In addition, only 40% and 23% of the initial
activity was retained at pH 6 and 10 after 24 hours incubation.
Figure 7A shows the variation of activity of the v-TA
immobilized on CCS-IONPs composites after multiple reusing
by magnetic separation. Although the activity of the immobilized
v-TA decreased after cycles, more than 50% of its initial activity
was still retained after 15 cycles. The storage stability of the free
and immobilized v-TA is shown in Figure 7B. The immobilized
v-TA retained more than 60% of its initial activity after stored at
4uC in PBS for 15 days, whereas the freev-TA only retained 39%
of its initial activity.
Discussion
The synthetic procedure of CCS-IONPs composites andv-TA
immobilization are illuminated as Figure 1. 1H-NMR analysis
(Figure S1) proves that the catechol monomer is introduced to CS
with a substitution of 52.2%. XPS analysis shows that the surface
chemical composition is altered among these materials. The
carbon and nitrogen peak on the CCS-IONPs composites confirm
the present of CCS coating. The increasing of N/C ratio 0.038 to
0.153 after v-TA immobilization indicates that v-TA is immo-
bilized onto the surface of the CCS-IONPs composites. The results
of TGA analysis further confirm the conclusion that CCS is
successfully coated on IONPs. The composites have magnetic
property and can be easily separated by magnet.
SEM and TEM images (Figure 4) show that the morphology of
the CCS-IONPs composites is different from that of CS-IONPs
composites. The reason is presumed that when water was
evaporated during the drying procedure, catechol bounded on
CS damaged the stability network stereo-structure which formed
via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bound among catechol,
CS, IONPs and water in aqueous environment. Catechol might be
self-polymerized or covalently linked with the remained amine
groups of CCS to cause CCS-IONPs composites cross-linked and
twisted, finally formed tightly aggregation during the evaporation

of the bound water. The result is similar to the process of drying of
melanin. It is observed that the process of drying produces melanin
aggregation [19].
The efficiency of v-TA immobilization using the adhesive
composites was investigated. Compared to the IONPs and the CS-
IONPs composites, the adhesive CCS-IONPs composites display
better enzyme loading capacity (681.7 mg/g), which is the higher
than present reports [20,21]. The high loading efficiency is

attributed to the strong affinity anchor from catechol which
exhibited reactivity toward amine and thiol groups [15]. This may
also be resulted from the high surface area due to the nano-porous
morphology of the composites. Although we did not observe
morphology of the adhesive composites in liquid state, the SEM
and TEM images (Figure 4B and 4C) show that there are nano-
porous in the aggregation after dried.
The stability of immobilizedv-TA was investigated in various
pH and temperatures. Compared to freev-TA, the stability of
immobilized v-TA increase significantly, retaining 25% and 68%
of its initial activity even after 60 hours incubation in pH 5 and 9,
respectively. The stability increase after immobilization may result
from multipoint covalent linking between v-TA and the CCS-
IONPs composites, leading to less denaturation of v-TA. The
reusability and storage stability of immobilized enzymes are very
important properties in their application, especially in industrial
applications. As shown in Figure 7, 51% of its initial activity was
still retained after 15 cycles, and more than 60% of its initial
activity was retained after stored at 4uC in PBS for 15days which is
significantly higher than the free enzyme retained (39%) at the
same condition. The results indicate that thev-TA immobilized
onto the adhesive CCS-IONPs composites has good stability,
reusability and magnetic recovery. The decrease of activity may be
caused by the aggregation and the leakage of the particles, the
denaturation of the protein and the graduallyv-TA detachment
from the carriers.
Materials and Methods
Materials
The recombinant E.coli strain harboring v-TA gene from
Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 was obtained in our laboratory.
Chitosan (low molecular weight), 3, 4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde,
sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) and isopropyl-b-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside (IPTG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(USA). (S)-a-methyl benzylamine ((S)-a-MBA), sodium pyruvate,
pyridoxal-59-phosphate (PLP) were purchased from Adamas

from SCRC (China).
Preparation of CCS-IONPs Composites
Figure 1 illustrates the synthesis of CCS-IONPs composites.
CCS was prepared by Bosch reduction according to the method
reported earlier [22] with some modifications. Briefly, 0.1 g CS
powder was dissolved in 20 ml 1% acetic acid solution and then
5 ml DMF contain 0.3 g 3, 4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde was added.
After magnetic stirred at room temperature for 6 hours, 40 ml
ethanol was added and pH was adjusted to 6.5 using 1 M NaOH.
Precipitation (Schiff base) was observed and filtered, washed with
water and ethanol to remove residual reagent. The Schiff base was
suspended in 20 ml water and 0.3 g NaBH3CN was added. After
stirred at room temperature for 6 hours, 40 ml ethanol was added.
The product was filtered and washed with water and ethanol, and
then dried at room temperature in vaccum. CCS was character-
ized by 1H-NMR. The degree of substitution for catechol
derivative was calculated from the1H-NMR spectrum.
IONPs were synthesized by co-precipitation method [23].
Generally, 10 mM FeCl3 and 5 mM FeCl2 were dissolved in
100 ml ultrapure water under nitrogen, the pH of the solution was
adjusted to 9.5 using 1 M NaOH solution. After stirred for 2 hours
at 40uC, IONPs were collected and washed several times with
ultrapure water using a magnetite, and dispersed in 100 ml
ultrapure water under ultrasonication for 15 min.
The CCS-IONPs composites were prepared by adding 50 ml
IONPs (50 mg) solution to 50 ml 1% acetic acid solution contain
100 mg CCS under vigorous stirring, then the pH of mixture was
adjusted to 7.0 using 1 M NaOH solution. After stirred for 1 hour
at room temperature, CCS-IONPs composites were separated
using magnetite and washed with ultrapure water several times.
The CCS-IONPs composites were stored at 4uC. The CS-IONPs
composites were prepared by the same method using CS instead of
CCS.

(1486.8 eV) 300-W X-ray source, a flood gun to counter charging
effects, and ultrahigh vacuum (,1029 torr). The takeoff angle was
fixed at 45u. Substrates were mounted on sample studs by means
of double-sided adhesive tape. All binding energies were calibrated
using the C (1 s) carbon peak (284.5 eV). Thermo gravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out on a SDT 2960 model from TA
Instruments. All samples were dried under vacuum overnight to
remove moisture before analysis and were performed under
nitrogen flow with a heating rate of 10uC/min. Scanning electron
microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were acquired on a Hitachi HD2300 electron microscope
(Hitachi, Japan) operated at 200 kV. The specimens were
prepared by casting drops of dilute dispersion of composites
aqueous solution on 200-mesh carbon coated copper grids and air-
drying. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were carried
out on a Nicomp 380 ZLS (PPS, USA). The CS-IONPs, CCS-
IONPs and IONPs were dispersed at a concentration of 0.1 mg/
ml in ultrapure water with ultrasonication for 15 minutes.
Preparation of v-TA
The recombinant E.coli strain was cultured in LB-ampicillin at
37uC. When the optical density of cells in culture at 600 nm
reached 0.6, IPTG was added to 0.1 mM. After incubated at 25uC
for 16 hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min,
4uC, 8000 rpm), washed with PBS and re-suspended in the same
buffer. After ultrasonicated at 4uC for 15 min in ultrasonic cell
disruptor (JY92-II, SCIENTZ, China), the raw enzyme solution of
v-TA was obtained after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 15 min
at 4uC. The supernatant was loaded on HisTrapTM FF crude
column (Pharmacia, USA). The proteins were eluted with
imidazole and desalted by ultrafiltration. The SDS-PAGE was
performed to check the results of expression and purification
(Figure S2). The specific activity of the v-TA was 8.64 U/mg
measured by the assay described in activity assay section.
Immobilization of v-TA
The fresh CCS-IONPs composites prepared previously were
dispersed in PBS under ultrasonication for 15 min. The immobi-
lization ofv-TA onto CCS-IONPs composites was carried out by
directly adding 1 ml enzyme solution (contain 1 mgv-TA) to 1 ml
CCS-IONPs composites (1 mg/ml) in PBS. After shaken at 4uC
for 3 hours, the v-TA loaded precipitates were collected and
washed 3 times with ultrapure water and stored at 4uC prior to be
used. The protein concentration of enzyme solution before and
after immobilization was determined using the Bradford method
[24]. The difference in protein concentration was used to calculate
the loading ofv-TA onto the CCS-IONPs composites. Immobi-
lization ofv-TA onto CS-IONPs and IONPs were carried out by
the same method using IONPs or CS-IONPs instead of CCS-
IONPs.
Activity Assay of Free and Immobilizedv-TA
The enzymatic activities of free and immobilizedv-TA were
measured by determining the concentration of acetophenone that
results from the reaction showed in Figure S3 at 37 uCi n
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM). The typical reaction volume
was 1 ml of 10 mM (S)-a-methyl benzylamine ((S)-a-MBA) and
10 mM sodium pyruvate with 0.1 mM PLP as co-enzyme. After
reacted for 10 min at 37uC, the reaction was stopped by addition
of 200ml 1 M HCl solution. The reaction mixtures were analyzed
by HPLC (1100 Series Agilent) using a C18 reverse phase column
(ODS2, 4.6 mm6250 mm, 5 mm, Thermo) at 210 nm and
245 nm with isocratic elution of 50% methanol and 50%
phosphate buffer (pH 4.0, 20 mM). One unit of enzyme is defined
as the amount ofv-TA which catalyzed the formation of 1
mmol
acetophenone per minute under the assay condition.
All activity measurements were carried out at least three times
and the experimental error was less than 5%.
Stability and Reusability of Immobilizedv-TA
The effect of pH on the activity of the free and immobilizedv-
TA was determined by pre-incubated at 4uC in buffer at pH
ranging from 6 to 10 for 24 hours, followed by determination of
enzyme activity at pH 8.0 as described in activity assay section.
For the thermal stability, the immobilized v-TA was pre-
incubated in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM) at temperature
ranging from 25 to 50uC for 3 hours, followed by measurement of
the residual enzyme activity at 37uC as described above.
To determine the storage stability of the enzyme, the free and
immobilized v-TA was stored in PBS at 4 uC, followed by
measurement of the residual enzyme activity every 3 days as
described above. The reusability of the immobilizedv-TA under
conditions of repeated magnetic isolation and reuse was investi-
gated under the same conditions as described in activity assay
section. After each run, the immobilizedv-TA was collected and
washed twice with ultrapure water using a magnetite to remove
any remaining substrate and product species before the next cycle.
The residual activity of the immobilizedv-TA after each cycle was
normalized to the initial value (the initial activity was defined as
100%).
