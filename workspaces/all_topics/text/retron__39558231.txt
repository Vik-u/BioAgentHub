ABSTRACT
Bacterial reverse transcriptase coding gene (RT) is essential for the production of a small satellite DNA‐RNA complex called
multicopy single‐stranded DNA (msDNA). In this study, we found a novel retron, retron‐Vmi1 (Vm85) fromVibrio mimicus.
The retron is comprised of themsr‐msd region, orf323, and theret gene, a genetic organization similar toSalmonella's retron‐
Sen2 (St85). The protein sequence of the RNA‐directed DNA polymerase (RT‐Vmi1) is highly homologous to the RTs ofVibrio
metoecus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, andVibrio vulnificus. Phylogenetic and protein sequence similarity analysis of retron‐Vmi1
ORF323 and RT revealed a close relatedness to retron‐Sen2. We found that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted in thedusA gene, similar
to the insertion of the retron‐Vpa1 (Vp96) ofV. parahaemolyticus AQ3354, suggesting that retrons can be transferred via the
tRNA gene. These results are the first convincing evidence that retron is moving across species. The neighboring genes of
retron‐Vmi1 shared high homology with the genetic environment ofV. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus retrons. We also
found two junction points within the retron‐Vmi1 and thedusA gene suggesting that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted into this site in a
two‐step manner.
1 | Introduction
Retrons are retro‐elements that are inserted into the bacterial
chromosome or as part of a large prophage DNA element in
different bacterial species [1, 2]. Retrons are essential to pro-
duce msDNA, a small satellite DNA‐RNA complex. The retron
is comprised of anmsr (RNA coding region),msd (DNA coding
region), and the ret (reverse transcriptase, RT) gene [3]. Bac-
terial RTs have the ability to synthesize both double‐strand
DNA and single‐stranded cDNA [4]. Retrons are speculated as
mobile elements according to msDNAs similarities, properties,
and amino acid identity of RTs as well as the transposition of
retron in the genome [5, 6]. Only one definitive function has
been attributed to retrons: their role in phage defense [7–9].

Retron elements associated with phage defense consist of three
functional components: themsr‐msd regions, theret gene, and
an effector gene, which encodes a protein responsible for the
actual defense mechanism against phages [7].
It is suggested that the distribution of retron in prokaryotes
is facilitated by lateral gene transmission as indicated
b yt h ed i f f e r e n c ei nt h eG Cc o n t e n to ft h er e t r o nw i t ht h e
host genome [2]. Horizontal gene transfer and acquisition of
f o r e i g nD N Ai saf u n d a m e n t a lp r o c e s si nt h ee v o l u t i o no f
most bacterial species [10]. The acquisition of mobile genetic
elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, transposons,
integrative and conjugative elements, and genomic islands
allows bacteria to instantly obtain a range of genetic traits
that may increase fitness under different environmental
conditions [11].
Although widely distributed i n prokaryotes, the retrons in
the bacteria population of the same species or related species
seemed to be uncommon [2]. Nowadays, retrons have been
isolated from different pathogenic bacteria such as en-
teroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), a classical en-
teropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Klebsiella pneumoniae ,
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Vibrio cho-
lerae [12–17]. As a close relative of V. cholerae , Vibrio mi-
micus has been implicated as one of the causative agents of
gastroenteritis including other infections [ 18, 19]. The vir-
ulence determinants of V. mimicus have not been well
c h a r a c t e r i z e d ,b u tr e c e n t l yi tw a ss h o w nt h a ts o m eV. mi-
micus strains harbor VPI ‐1 (TCP) and CTX φ (CTX) and
produce multiple toxins, including haemolysin, zonula oc-
cludens toxin, a heat ‐stable enterotoxin, and CT ‐like
toxin [20–24].
In this study, we characterized a novel retron, retron‐Vmi1,
identified in V. mimicus, and provided insights into its genetic
organization, evolutionary relationships, and potential mecha-
nisms of interspecies transfer. Our results contribute to a better
understanding of retron biology and the dynamics of genetic
transfer among bacterial species.
2 | Materials and Methods
2.1 | msDNA Isolation
V. mimicus CS30 (ctx+) was used in this study. The strain was
grown in Lennox broth (LB) supplemented with 1.5% NaCl
(final concentration) at 37°C. msDNA fromV. mimicus CS30
was isolated by the alkaline lysis method, similar to plasmid
extraction, as described previously [13].
2.2 | Labeling and Sequencing of msDNA
The DNA part of msDNA was separated by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and purified by electroelution. The DNA part of
msDNA was labeled at the 3′ end with [α‐32P] dideoxyATP and
terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and purified by urea/
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [25].
The DNA sequence of msDNA‐Vmi1 (Vm85) was determined
by the Maxam‐Gillbert method as described previously [26].
Based on the sequence of the msDNA part, the retron region
was cloned by inverse PCR, and the nucleotide sequence was
then determined. The secondary structure of the msDNA ‐
Vmi1 was predicted using the GENETYX‐MAC software [27].
2.3 | DNA Sequencing of Retron Region by
Inverse PCR
Chromosomal DNA ofV. mimicus CS30 was prepared by con-
ventional method and DNA was digested with several restriction
enzymes [28]. DNA fragments were ligated by using TaKaRa
Ligation kit Ver.2 (Takara, Japan) for self‐ligation. We used this
DNA as a template for PCR. Amplification reactions were carried
out with 100 ng of DNA and PCR reaction mixture containing
100 µM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl
2,2 5 p m o lo f
primers, and 1U of Phusion Hot Start High‐Fidelity DNA poly-
merase (FINNZYMES, Finland) and brought to a final volume of
50 µL using distilled water. Primers were designed based on the
msDNA sequence. The PCR cycle included initial denaturation at
98°C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 5 s at 98°C,
primer annealing for 30 s at 55°C, extension for 3 min at 72°C, and
a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR fragment was then
purified from the agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen KK, Japan). Both DNA strands of the PCR product were
sequenced using an ABI automatic DNA sequencer (Model
3730xl; Applied Biosystems).
2.4 | Cloning of Retron ‐Vmi1
Retron‐Vmi1 was amplified with the following reaction mixture:
100 ng of chromosomal DNA, 100 µM deoxynucleoside tri-
phosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of primers (ret‐F1, ret‐R12)
and 1U of Phusion Hot Start High‐Fidelity DNA polymerase
(FINNZYMES, Finland) with a final volume of 50 µL. Primers
were designed to amplify a full‐length retron‐Vmi1. The PCR cycle
included initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles
of denaturation for 5 s at 98°C, primer annealing for 30 s at 55°C,
extension for 1.5 min at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C
for 7 min. The PCR fragment was then purified from the agarose
gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen KK, Japan).
Retron‐Vmi1 was cloned into SmaI‐digested pBluescript II SK
(‐) (Stratagene, USA) using the TaKaRa Ligation Kit Ver.2 (Takara,
Japan). Then, the ligation mixtures were used to transformE. coli
TG1 competent cells. Bacteria were grown in an LB agar medium
supplemented with 50 mg/L of X‐Gal, 1 mM IPTG, and 100 µg/mL
of ampicillin. Positive colonieswere screened by a white/blue
selection protocol. The recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated
from the transformed cells by using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
(Qiagen KK, Japan) and the DNA sequence of the insert was
determined for both strands.
2.5 | Genomic Analysis of Retron‐Vmi1
The location of retron‐Vmi1 from V. mimicus CS30 was iden-
tified based on the nucleotide sequence of the msDNA‐Vmi1.
2o f7 6 Microbiology and Immunology, 2025
The msd region was determined according to the nucleotide
sequence of msDNA‐Sen2. The retron promoter was identified
based on the conserved promoter sequence using the
GENETYX‐MAC software. The ORF323 and RT nucleotide
similarity search was carried out using the BLAST program
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). TheattL and attR sites
were located based on the LOGO consensus sequences ofattL
and attR direct repeats from dusA‐specific genome island
sequences [28].
To construct the sequence similarity network (SSN), amino acid
sequence BLAST of V. mimicus ORF323 and RT‐Vmi1 was
initially performed in the EFI‐enzyme similarity tool (EFI‐EST)
set at UNIPROT BLAST querye‐value of Log
−5 [29, 30]. The
SSN was then constructed and visualized in Cytoscape 3.10.1
software using the organic layout [31]. Nodes were connected in
ORF323 and RT by 45% and 55%, respectively. This was based
on the percent similarity with retron‐Sen2 ORF320 and RT‐
Sen2, respectively.
For the phylogenetic analysis, the nucleotide sequence of RT‐Vmi1
and representative RTs (N = 24) of other bacterial retrons were
aligned by ClustalW, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
(1000 bootstrap replicates) [32] was constructed using the MEGA
10.1.8. program [33]. To construct the phylogenetic network,
additional RT sequences (N =8 1 ) w e r e i n c l u d e d a n d a l i g n e d
consequently. RT nucleotide sequences were collated using the
DnaSP 6.12.03 software resulting to 41 unique RT sequences
(considered as RT haplotypes) [34]. The phylogenetic network was
then constructed using the TCS method [35]i nP o p A r t1 . 7s o f t -
ware [36].
3 | Results and Discussion
3.1 | Identification of msDNA ‐Vmi1
The DNA part of msDNA was purified from the gel by elec-
troelution after separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophor-
esis, and then the DNA sequence was determined as described
above (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession No. LC791609). The
DNA sequence data showed that the msDNA isolated from
V. mimicus consists of 85 bases of single‐stranded DNA and is,
thus, referred to as msDNA‐Vmi1 (Figure 1).
According to the common structural features of all msDNAs
identified to date and the mechanism of msDNA biosynthesis
[24], msDNA‐Vmi1 was predicted to be branched out from
the guanosine residue (branching G) (Figure1, red highlight)
at the 12th position of the RNA molecule by a unique 2′,5 ′‐
phosphodiester linkage, a distinctive feature essential for the
reverse transcriptase‐mediated priming [37]. The length of the
RNA part of msDNA‐Vmi1 was predicted to be 79 bases from
the msr gene of retron‐Vmi1 as determined by the identified
conserved a1/a2 inverted repeat sequences (Figure3). The RNA
region is comprised of two RNA stem loops (RSL1 and RSL2),
three single‐stranded RNA segments (ssRa‐c), and a DNA‐RNA
duplex. Interestingly, the DNA stem structure of msDNA‐Vmi1
contained a mismatched base pair in its DNA stem (Figure1,
yellow highlight). msDNAs from other pathogenic bacteria
containing mismatched base pairs in their DNA stem ‐loop
structure are regarded as potentially mutagenic [38]. By com-
paring the msDNA‐Vmi1 structure with other msDNAs isolated
from pathogenic bacteria, we found a number of conserved
regions that are present in all msDNAs of these bacteria (Fig-
ure 1, blue highlights), especially msDNA ‐Sen2 from
S. Typhimurium. Sequence homology search showed that

ing G residue is highlighted in red. The msDNA cleavage sites are

V. mimicus CS30 msr‐msd region (msDNA‐Vmi1) shares 100%
nucleotide homology with V. vulnificus msDNA region, 73.7%
with msDNA ‐Sen2 (from S. Typhimurium), 64.2% with
msDNA‐Eco4 (Ec83) (from EAEC), 61.7% with msDNA‐Vpa1
(Vp96) (from V. parahaemolyticus), 60.5% with msDNA‐Eco7
(Ec78) (from EPEC), and 60.4% with msDNA ‐Vch1 (Vc95)
(from V. cholerae).
The conserved tetra nucleotides (Figure 1, dotted box) 5′‐
TAGA‐3′ (in msDNA ‐Sen2, msDNA ‐Vch1 (Vc95), and
msDNA‐Vpa1 or 5′‐TTGA‐3′ (msDNA‐Eco4) that plays an
important role during recognition and cleavage of msDNA
was not found in msDNA ‐Vmi1 [ 39]. msDNA ‐Vmi1 con-
served tetra nucleotides 5′‐TCAG‐3′ was similar to msDNA‐
Eco1 (Ec85) (Wang et al., 2022). The cleavage site (Figure1,
green highlight) was conserved among the evaluated
msDNA [39]. In the msrRNA, the SLR2a n ds s R c ,r e p o r t e dt o
exhibit extensive contact with the reverse transcriptase in
msDNA‐Eco1, were also conserved in the msDNA‐Vmi1 [40].
This ssRc together with the DNA ‐RNA complex is also
found to sit in proximity with the reverse transcriptase active
site YADD (Figure 7)[ 40] ,w h i c hi sa l s oc o n s e r v e da m o n g
the retron‐RTs. These common conserved sequences could
denote a common evolutionary origin, and it is interesting to
examine whether these sequences are associated with
pathogenicity.
3.2 | Organization of Retron ‐Vmi1
The DNA sequence data retrieved from this study revealed a
novel retron inV. mimicus, designated as retron‐Vmi1, the first
reported retron element in V. mimicus. Retron‐Vmi1 is an
operon of approximately 2.2 kb consisting of two open reading
frames (ORFs), including the RT (Figure2). A putative inner
membrane protein, designated as ORF323, with 323 amino
acid residues is present between the RT (RT‐Vmi1; 302 aa) and
msr‐msd region. This genetic organization is similar to that
reported for S. Typhimurium retron‐Sen2 [13]. The promoter
region prediction of retron‐Vmi1 was predicted 6 bp upstream
of the msr–msd region as it contains well‐conserved −35 and
−10 regions (Figure3).
Upstream of retron ‐Vmi1, there are two unknown ORFs,
ORF276 and ORF133, and they have shown high homology to
the proteins downstream of retron ‐Vpa1, ORF114, and
ORF279 (Figure 4). Downstream of retron ‐Vmi1 are three
proteins: ORF356 (AAA family ATPase), ORF361 (site ‐
specific integrase), and ORF359 (site ‐specific integrase),
which are homologous to proteins located on the upstream
region of retron ‐Vpa1. The organization of retron ‐Vmi1 is
similar to retron ‐Eco3 isolated from a clinical isolate of
E. coli [41], retron ‐Sen2 from S. Typhimurium [12], and
retron‐Vch2 (Vc81) from a non ‐O1/non‐O139 V. cholerae
FIGURE 3 | Nucleotide sequence of the upstream and promoter region and themsr‐msd region of retron‐Vmi1. Sequences correspond to the
nucleotide region 3118–3456 and 5398–5510 (DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Accession No. LC791609). The second and third lines are shown as double‐
stranded DNA. The direct repeat region is boldfaced. The predicted promoter sequences (−35 and−10) are underlined. The branching guanosine in
the msr region is circled. The boldfaced regions indicate the conserved a1/a2 inverted repeat sequences. The underlined sequences indicate the direct
repeat sequences.

msr–msd region and the ret gene (Figure 2).
Amino acid alignment of V. mimicus ORF323 with other
Vibrio spp. showed high similarity withV. metoecus(323/323 aa;
100%), V. cholerae (322/323 aa; 99.69%), and V. vulnificus
(316/323 aa; 97.52%). SSN analysis of ORF323 with other bac-
terial species also revealed that the protein is closely related to
the retron‐Sen2 family effector protein (Figure5A). Although
the amino acid sequences of these ORFs have significant
homology, their associated retrons exist differently on the
bacterial chromosome. For example, retron‐Eco3 is associated
with a prophage, while retron ‐Sen2 appears to be inserted
directly in the chromosome, suggesting that retrons can be
inserted in different mechanisms.
3.3 | Comparison of the RT‐Vmi1 with the RT
from Other Vibrios
We then investigated the homology of RT‐Vmi1 to otherVibrio
spp. and observed 100% identity (301/301 aa) with both
V. metoecusand V. parahaemolyticusand 99.34% (299/301 aa) in
V. vulnificus (Figure 6).
In addition, we also investigated the homology of
RT‐Vmi1 with the retron RT of other pathogenic bacteria.
The highest similarities to RT ‐Vmi1 were with RT ‐Sen2
(from S. Typhimurium, 56.5% identity), RT ‐Vch1 (from
V. cholerae , 44.5% identity), RT ‐Eco4 (from aggregative
adherence E. coli , AAEC, 43.7% identity), RT ‐Vpa1 (from
V. parahaemolyticus , 45.4% identity), RT ‐Eco7 (from en-
teropathogenic E. coli, EPEC, 44.5% identity), and RT‐Vch2
(from V. cholerae, 46.8% identity). The SSN of RT‐Vmi1 ex-
hibits that RT‐Vmi1 is more closely related to RT‐Sen2 as it
is located at the Salmonella c l u s t e ro v e rt h eVibrio cluster
(Figure 5B).
Multiple amino acid sequence alignments also revealed that
t h e s eR T ss h a r es e v e r a lh i g h l yconserved domains in addition
to the highly conserved catalytic tetrad YADD (residues
193–196), the retron‐specific region containing the NAXXH
(residues 90–94) and VTG triplet (residues 244–246) that are
present in all retron RTs (Figure 7)[ 43, 44]. This suggests
that RTs associated with retrons exhibit high sequence sim-
ilarity when they share similar genetic organization. The
high similarity indicates that these RTs are likely to perform
similar functions, specifically in the production or regulation
of msDNAs in bacteria.

BLAST E‐value of 1 × 10−5. Sequence BLAST and network data were generated using the EFI‐EST database, and the SSN was constructed in
Cytoscape using an organic layout. The ORF323 full network contains 342 nodes with edges connected at≥ 45% identity. The RT full network
contains 978 nodes with edges connected at≥ 55% identity.

3.4 | Phylogenetic Analysis of RT‐Vmi1
We then carried out a phylogenetic analysis of RT‐Vmi1 to
determine its genetic lineage. A phylogenetic tree was con-
structed using the nucleotide sequences of ret (RT) genes
(Figure 8). The phylogenetic tree analysis showed a significant
diversity among the host bacterial species, as RT ‐Vmi1 of
V. mimicusassociates closely with RT‐Sen2 ofS. Typhimurium
rather than the RT ‐Vch1 of V. cholerae and RT ‐Vpa1 of
V. parahaemolyticus. The data indicate that several bacterial
species, including E. coli, Salmonella, and Vibrio, have likely
acquired the retron very similar to retron ‐Sen2 through a
transduction event. This is evidenced by the related retron‐Eco3
(Figure 2), which is still found in a functional prophage DNA.
The presence of bothattL and attR sites also suggests that these
retrons are associated with prophage DNA sequences (Fig-
ure 4). These results substantiate that retrons are indeed mobile
genetic elements, which can migrate between different bacterial
species. The phylogenic tree showed the RTs from investigated
Vibrio species split into two subclades, one associated withE.
coli RTs and one with Salmonella Sen2 family RTs. The 1‐A
retron type under which retron‐Eco7, Eco4, Vpa1, and Vch1
belong is characterized by an associated/fused protein domain
containing an N‐terminal ATPase module [45]. Whereas retron‐
Sen2, Vch2, and Eco3 (Ec73) contain an N‐terminal nucleoside
deoxyribosyltransferase‐like (NDT) + C‐terminal DNA binding
domain, a characteristic also shared by retron‐Vmi1. It is no
surprise that RT‐Vmi1 is more closely related to theV. cholerae
non‐O1/non‐O139 RT (RT‐Vch2) than RT‐Vch1 of pathogenic
V. cholerae (Figure 8). Such observation could provide infor-
mation on the evolutionary process of
V. mimicus from V.
cholerae.
A haplotype network was constructed to get a clearer rela-
tionship of RT‐Vmi1 with otherret genes associated with the
retron element. From the representative nucleotide
sequences used in the phylogenetic tree construction, we
have included additional RT sequences to extensively evalu-
ate this genetic relationsh ip. Given that retrons are
mobile elements, the TCS network validates that RT ‐Vmi1
could have descended from S. enterica (RT‐Sen2) through
V. parahaemolyticus (Figure 9). The RTs from V. metoecus
and V. vulnificus c o u l dh a v ea l s ou n d e r g o n et h es a m ep r o -
cess. Moreover, the RTs from different Vibrio species, espe-
cially V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus , were scattered
throughout the network and did not form a distinct clade
indicating that the retro n element across different Vibrio

FIGURE 8 | Phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on nucleotide
sequences of ret (RT) genes (1034 positions). The evolutionary history
was inferred using MEGA X with the Maximum Likelihood method and

The percentage of bootstrap replicates (1000 replicates) supporting each
branch is indicated next to the nodes. Branch lengths represent the

species is likely to be more distributed compared to
S. enterica retrons. This could be attributed to the ubiquity of
vibrios in aquatic ecosystems where the mobility of mobile
genetic elements, including retrons, is less restricted.
3.5 | Retron ‐Vmi1 is Inserted into thedusA Gene
We further examined the nucleotide sequences upstream and
downstream of retron‐Vmi1 to find out its insertion environment in
FIGURE 10 | Structure and similarity of retron‐Vmi1 and its genomic environment with otherVibrio species. The location of the genes and their
transcriptional directions are indicated by arrows. This figure is generated using the GenomeMatcher program [47].

the V. mimicus CS30 genome. We found that retron‐Vmi1 was
inserted into a gene encoding for a tRNA dihydrouridine synthase
DusA (dusA gene). Interestingly, the retron ofV. parahaemolyticus
AQ3354 (AB433983.1) is also inserted in a similar manner; how-
ever, the composition of its operon is different. Retron‐Vmi1 resides
in the chromosome with two integrase and helicase genes similar to
retron‐Vpa1. Interestingly,attL and attR locations flanked by tRNA
dihidrouridine synthase gene in retron‐Vpa1, and direct repeat are
t h es a m ea sr e t r o n‐Vmi1. The sequence of the tRNA gene in vibrios
is highly conserved, and the presence of horizontal gene transfer
mobile elements betweenV. mimicusand V. choleraesuggests that
retrons can be transferred via the tRNA gene. Many prophage
DNAs and other related elements, such as integrative and con-
jugative elements (ICEs) use the tRNA gene as an insertion site
[46]. This provides further evidence that the retron inVibrio may
have been acquired through a transduction event.
We then compared the retron‐Vmi1 environment with other
bacterial strains having an RT with high homology to
RT‐Vpa1 (Figure 10). We found that V. mimicus CS30,
V. parahaemolyticusPHLUSAVBR00185 (AAXMTX000000000),
and V. vulnificusV252 (NZ_LIIO01000008) have high homology
not only in the retron region but also in the neighboring two
integrases and DNA regulatory factors. Retron‐Vmi1 is inserted
between the zur and dusA genes and the junction point was
speculated. This junction point contains a GAGGCAC sequence
which is located upstream of themsr‐msd region. Surprisingly,
we foundV. anguillarum90‐11‐286 (CP011460), which lacks the
retron region. Hence, the existence of another junction point
(junction point 2) in the retron region was also speculated. This
second junction point contains an ATGCTCGAT sequence,
which was in the 5′ terminus of the dusA gene. Our results
suggested that retron‐Vmi1 was inserted into this site in a two‐
step manner.
