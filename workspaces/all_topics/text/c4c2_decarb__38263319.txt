Many types of tumors feature aerobic glycolysis for meeting their increased
energetic and biosynthetic demands. However, it remains still unclear how this
glycolytic phenomenon is achieved and coordinated with other metabolic
pathways in tumor cells in response togrowth stimuli. Here we report that
activation of AKT1 induces a metabolic switch to glycolysis from the mito-
chondrial metabolism via phosphorylation of cytoplasmic malic enzyme 2
(ME2), named ME2ﬂ (ﬂ means full length), favoring an enhanced glycolytic
phenotype. Mechanistically, in thecytoplasm, AKT1 phosphorylates ME2ﬂ at
serine 9 in the mitochondrial localization signal peptide at the N-terminus,
preventing its mitochondrial translocation. Unlike mitochondrial ME2, which
accounts for adjusting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, ME2ﬂ functions as a
scaffold that brings together the key glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase
(PFKL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate
kinase M2 (PKM2), as well as Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), to promote
glycolysis in the cytosol. Thus,through phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ,A K T 1
enhances the glycolytic capacity of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, revealing an
unexpected role for subcellular translocation switching of ME2 mediated by
AKT1 in the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells to growth stimuli.
Metabolic alteration facilitates autonomous proliferation and survival
of tumor cells1,2. One of the most characteristic features of tumor cells
is that they prefer to use glycolysis to produce energy and building
blocks even in the presence of sufﬁcient oxygen, which is also known
as the Warburg effect
2,3. Clearly, understanding how this metabolic
change is regulated and achieved in cancer cells could reveal metabolic
vulnerabilities. Although an increasing number of studies suggest that
active glycolysis in tumor cells is closely linked to genetic alterations,
the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear.
Malic enzyme (ME) is the enzyme that catalysis the oxidative dec-
arboxylation of malate to produce pyruvate and NADPH or NADH
4,5.
Three ME isoforms have been identiﬁed in mammalian cells: cytoplasmic
NADP+-dependent isozyme (ME1), mitochondrial NAD/ P+-dependent
isozyme (ME2), and mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isozyme (ME3),
with ME1 and ME2 being the major isoforms6. By recycling the TCA cycle
intermediate malate to pyruvate, these enzymesﬁne-tune the TCAﬂux,
allowing the cell to maintain a certain balance of energy, reducing
equivalents and biosynthetic precursor requirements. Notably, ME2

activity is highly elevated in tumor cells and correlates with tumor
progression6–10, and NADPH generation and redox control capabilities
confer potent oncogenic function to ME26,11. Interestingly, loss of ME2 in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been shown to require
ME3 for metabolic compensation and survival12. Recent studies have also
revealed a role for ME2 in metabolically controlling mutant p53 stability
and epigenetic programming
10,13.
As one of the most common events in human tumors, aberrant
activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling
network exerts multiple effects on cellular metabolism through
direct or indirect regulation, resulting in a disconnection of cell
proliferation and survival from exogenous growth stimuli
14.I ng e n -
eral, recruitment of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma
membrane leads to phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trispho-
sphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which further recruits the serine/threonine
protein kinase AKT to the plasma membrane for phosphorylation at
T308 and S473 by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
(PDPK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2),
respectively. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can be dephosphorylated to PtdIns(4,5)
P2 by phosphatases and Tensin homologues (PTEN), thereby
attenuating PI3K-AKT signaling. Interestingly, AKT is able to be
activated by SETDB1-mediated lysine methylation after PtdIns(3,4,5)
P3 interaction
15,16.
In response to stimulation by growth factors or carcinogens, AKT
tends to be activated in tumor cells and phosphorylates distinct sub-
strates to perform different biological processes, including
metabolism14,17. For instance, activated AKT directly phosphorylates
NAD kinase (NADK) to produce NADP +, facilitating tumor cell
proliferation18. Notably, activation of AKT has been shown to be suf-
ﬁcient to promote aerobic glycolysis19,20. Through phosphorylation,
AKT controls both glucose uptake and several steps in glycolysis via
post-translational and also transcriptional regulation of glucose
transporters and glycolytic enzymes. However, many of these reg-
ulatory effects of AKT on the promoting aerobic glycolysis that con-
tribute to the synthesis of macromolecules in tumor cells are
condition-dependent. Importantly, glycolysis is directly coupled with
mitochondrial metabolism such as the TCA cycle, which acts as a major
process supporting the energetic and biosynthetic demands of pro-
liferating cancer cells
21,22. It remains still unclear how PI3K-AKT sig-
naling coordinates these two fundamental processes to meet energy
and biosynthetic demands, and notably, the direct control of the PI3K-
AKT pathway on the TCA cycle has not been determined.
Here we report that activated AKT1 directly phosphorylates ME2
at serine 9 in the cytosol, leading to a discovery of a cytoplasmic form
of ME2, ME2ﬂ. In contrast to the direct role of mitochondrial ME2 in
regulating the TCA cycle, ME2ﬂ bridges multiple key glycolytic
enzymes together, resulting in a strong enhancement of glycolyticﬂux.
Thus, through phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ, AKT induces a metabolic
switch to glycolysis from mitochondrial TCA cycle, thereby supporting

Results
Increased cytoplasmic localization of ME2 induced by PTEN loss
We previously discovered that malic enzymes (MEs), in particularly,
ME2 functions in modulating wild-type and mutant p53 activity and cell
fate via distinct mechanisms
6,10. To further explore the regulatory role
of ME2 in tumors, we sought to investigate if subcellular localization
would determine the metabolic activity of ME2. Previous studies have
generally suggested that ME2 is a mitochondrial localization protein
involved in the regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism within
mitochondria. Consistent with this, electron microscopy immunogold
analysis showed that ME2 is almost exclusively localized in mito-
chondria in multiple PTEN-normally expressing cell lines including
A 5 4 9 ,H 1 2 9 9 ,P C 9 ,a n dU 2 O S( F i g .1a, up panels). However, substantial
amounts of ME2 were found in the cytosol of PTEN-deﬁcient PC3 and
U87 cells (Fig.1a, bottom panel). These unexpectedﬁndings raise a
possibility that PTEN status may inﬂuence the subcellular localization
of ME2. To conﬁrm this, we knocked down the expression of PTEN in
PC9 and HepG2 cells respectively. Strikingly, PTEN depletion resulted
in a marked accumulation of ME2 in the cytosol (Fig.1b). Moreover, we
also employed the Structured Illumination super-resolution Micro-
scope (SIM) analysis and found that ME2 predominantly existed in
cytosol when PTEN was depleted (Fig.1c). Direct subcellular fraction
uncovered that increased cytosol ME2 was observed in PTEN-depleted
HepG2 cells (Fig.1d). PTEN is a master regulator of multiple AKT-
dependent and independent pathways associated with oncogenic
effects
23. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of AKT using
MK2206, a selective inhibitor of AKT, obviously reduced the cyto-
plasmic levels of ME2, and increased the mitochondrial localization of
ME2 in multiple cell lines (Supplementary Figs. 1a–d, 2a and 2b).
Moreover, inhibition of AKT attenuated the cytoplasmic accumulation
of ME2 in PTEN-deﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Collectively,
these ﬁndings indicate that PTEN-AKT axis regulates the subcellular
localization of ME2.
AKT1 binds to and phosphorylates ME2ﬂ,ac y t o p l a s m i cM E 2
Next, we investigated how AKT signaling activation accumulates
cytoplasmic ME2. Among the AKT isoforms, AKT1 is the predominantly
expressed isoform in most tissues
24. We therefore focused on AKT1
here. Since AKT1, as a protein kinase, usually binds to its substrate
proteins, we hypothesized that AKT1 may directly act on ME2 in the
cytosol. To test possibility, weﬁrst examined whether AKT1 affects the
cellular localization of ME2. Forced expression of C-terminal Flag-
tagged ME2 (denoted as ME2-3’Flag) resulted in near complete mito-
chondrial localization, and when cells were co-transfected with AKT1,
signiﬁcant cytoplasmic localizationo fA K T 1a n dM E 2w a so b s e r v e d
(Fig. 2a), suggesting that AKT1 might directly interact with ME2. Since
an apparent cytoplasmic localization of ME2 was observed in the
situations of PTEN loss or AKT1 activation, we further determined
whether ME2 is a protein of the same amino acid composition in
cytoplasm and mitochondria. By LC-MS-mediated N-terminal amino
acid sequence analysis of ME2 proteins puriﬁed from cytosol and
mitochondria, we found that there are actually two different structural
forms of ME2 protein, with 18 more amino acids at the N-terminal end
of ME2 in the cytoplasm (namely as ME2ﬂ)c o m p a r e dt oM E 2i nt h e
mitochondria (namely as ME2m) (Fig.2b, and Supplementary Fig. 3a,
b). This result was also veriﬁed by the western blot analysis of the
expression size of the proteins tagged different ends (Fig.2c). In case
of N-terminal Flag-tagged ME2 (5’Flag-ME2), only full-length ME2
(ME2ﬂ) was detected, and if the Flag tag was at the C-terminus (ME2-
3’Flag), 2 different sizes of ME2 were detected: full-length (ME2ﬂ)a n d
missing N-terminal 18 amino acids (referred as ME2m) (Fig.2c). Cel-
lular sub-localization analysis further revealed that ME2 was observed
in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells transfected with C-
terminal-labeled ME2 ﬂ, while N-terminal-labeled ME2, over-
whelmingly, was found in the cytoplasm (Fig.2d). Thus, theseﬁndings
suggest that what was previously commonly thought to be ME2 is in
fact the mitochondrial-localized ME2, a truncated peptide missing the
N-terminal 18 amino acids, whereas full-length ME2 (ME2ﬂ)i sm o s t l y
found in the cytoplasm and can be accumulated by AKT activation.
Consistent with the co-localization data (Fig.2a), AKT1 was able to
bind to the full-length cytoplasmic ME2 (ME2ﬂ), but not to ME2 that is
missing the N-terminal 18 amino acids (Fig.2e). This also suggests that
the binding region of AKT1 on ME2ﬂ should be located within the
N-terminal amino acids 1–18 (Fig.2e). In keeping with this, AKT1 did not
bind to ME2 in the mitochondria (Fig.2f). We also conﬁrmed that AKT1
could strongly bound to ME2ﬂ at both exogenous and endogenous
levels (Fig.2g, and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). An in vitro binding assay
using bacterially puriﬁed proteins demonstrated that AKT1 could form

complex with ME2ﬂ directly (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Taken together,
these data suggest that AKT1 is a direct cytoplasmic binding partner
of ME2ﬂ.
AKT1 is a pivotal serine-threonine kinase determining various
cellular physiological and pathological processes14,17,25. Cells trans-
fected with wild-type, or a constitutively activated form (CA) of AKT1
displayed a strong phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ (Fig. 2h, and Supple-
mentary Fig. 4e). By contrast, introduction of the kinase-dead form
(KD) of AKT1 had no effect on ME2ﬂ phosphorylation (Fig.2h). These
ﬁndings suggest ME2ﬂ is a phosphorylation target for AKT1. To
conﬁrm the occurrence of endogenous phosphorylated ME2 by
AKT, we treated cells with various growth stimulants, including

insulin, FBS, and EGF, to activate AKT. Notably, growth stimulation
led to increased phosphorylation levels of ME2ﬂ (Supplementary
Fig. 4f). Moreover, the increase in ME2ﬂ phosphorylation induced by
insulin was largely abolished by the supplementation of MK2206
(Fig. 2i). In addition to MK2206, other PI3K inhibitors, such as
GDC0068, GDC0032 and PKI587, were also able to block the ME2ﬂ
phosphorylation during growth stimulation (Supplementary
Fig. 4g–i). We further examined whether AKT1 directly phosphor-
ylates ME2ﬂ by performing in vitro phosphorylation assays using
puriﬁed proteins. Remarkably, the addition of AKT1 in the presence
of ATP increased the phosphorylation level of ME2ﬂ and, interest-
ingly, higher ME2ﬂ enzymatic activity was observed in this case
(Fig. 2j, and Supplementary Fig. 4j). These data suggest that AKT1
directly phosphorylates ME2ﬂ and increases its enzymatic activity.
In line with this, signiﬁcantly increased ME2 activity was found in
cells treated with insulin, and this effect was blocked by AKT inhi-
bition (Fig.2i).
Serine 9 on ME2ﬂ is responsible for the phosphorylation
by AKT1
To further understand the phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ by AKT1, we
performed mass spectrometry analysis to identify the exact residue(s)
phosphorylated by AKT1 on ME2ﬂ.S p e c iﬁcally, we found that the
peptides containing phosphorylated serine 9 (Ser 9) at the N-terminal
of ME2ﬂ were enriched (Fig.3a). Moreover, this Ser 9 is in a conserved
recognition sequence for AKT phosphorylation and, similar sequences
exist in mice and rats (Fig.3b ) .T h u s ,t h er e s i d u eS e r9m i g h tb ea
potential target for phosphorylation by AKT1. To conﬁrm this, we
generated a mutant ME2ﬂ containing a serine-to-alanine substitution
(S9A). Strikingly, S9A mutation completely blocked the phosphoryla-
tion of ME2ﬂ by exogenous AKT1 (Fig.3c). Moreover, stimulation of
cells with growth factors insulin, EGF or FBS, failed to induce phos-
phorylation of ME2ﬂS9A (Fig.3d, and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). These
ﬁndings were also obtained in vitro using puriﬁed proteins. While AKT1
addition triggered the phosphorylation of wild-type ME2ﬂ,n oc l e a r
phosphorylation of ME2ﬂS9A was observed even in the presence of
AKT1(Fig.3e, and Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). Therefore, it appears that
AKT1 phosphorylates ME2ﬂ at Ser 9. To further conﬁrm theseﬁndings,
we generated an anti-ME2ﬂ (phospho-S9) antibody (Supplementary
Fig. 5f), and again, we found that while AKT1 strongly promoted ME2ﬂ
p h o s p h o r y l a t i o nw h e nt h e yw e r ec o - e x p r e s s e di n2 9 3 Tc e l l s ,S 9 A
mutation abolished the phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ by AKT1 as detected
by using the anti-ME2ﬂ (phospho-S9) antibody, as well as an anti-
RxxpS/T antibody (Fig.3f). Similarﬁndings were observed in in vitro
phosphorylation assays using puriﬁed proteins (Fig.2j). Importantly,
phosphorylation of endogenous ME2ﬂ was observed in response to
growth stimulation, and AKT inhibition abrogated this effect (Fig.3g).
In keeping with theﬁndings that phosphorylation increases ME2ﬂ
activity (Fig.2i, j), the S9A mutation resulted in a decrease in ME2ﬂ
activity, whereas the serine-to-aspartate (S9D) mutation, which mimics
phosphorylation, enhanced the enzymatic activity of ME2ﬂ (Fig. 3h).
Interestingly, S9A mutation enhanced the binding between ME2ﬂ and
AKT1, and ME2ﬂS9D almost showed no binding ability towards AKT1,
indicating AKT1 may prefer unphosphorylated ME2
ﬂ for interaction
(Supplementary Fig. 5g). Collectively, theseﬁndings suggest that AKT1
phosphorylates ME2ﬂ at Ser 9 and enhances its activity.
Ser 9 phosphorylation attenuates the mitochondrial transloca-
tion of ME2ﬂ
Increased expression or activation of AKT1 leads to cytoplasmic
accumulation of ME2ﬂ. We therefore wanted to know if phosphor-
ylation of ME2ﬂ forces its cytoplasmic localization. By analyzing the
N-terminal of ME2ﬂ using the PrediSi prediction method, we found
that the sequence of residues 1–18 had a mitochondrial localization
signal sequence feature and might be a mitochondrial localization
signal peptide (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In supporting of this, dele-
tion of this 18aa peptide leads to cytoplasmic anchoring of ME2ﬂ
(Fig. 4a, b). Moreover, disruption of the mitochondrial localization
signal sequence signature by point mutations at the Arg 4 and Arg 6
sites apparently prevented GFP mitochondrial localization (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6b, c).
In addition, if this 18-amino acid-peptide segment is typically a
mitochondrial localization signal peptide, it will be processed and
excised upon entry into the mitochondria. To test this, we expressed
wild-type as well as Ser 9 mutant ME2ﬂ in cells with Flag tags at their
C-termini. Notably, by immunoﬂuorescence and western blot ana-
lysis, wild-type ME2ﬂ and S9A mutant were observed almost exclu-
sively in mitochondria (Fig.4c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). In
contrast, ME2ﬂS9D exhibited both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
localizations (Fig.4c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). We obtained
similar ﬁndings when expressing the C-terminal GFP-tagged ME2ﬂ
(Supplementary Fig. 6f, g). Thus, theseﬁndings suggest that the vast
majority of ME2ﬂ expressed in the cytoplasm may be translocated to
the mitochondria and subsequently its N-terminal 1-18aa signal
peptide is removed, while Ser 9 phosphorylation apparently pre-
vents this mitochondrial localization process. To further conﬁrm
this, we constructed C-terminal GFP fusion expression plasmids
expressing only the wild-type or mutant 1-18aa peptide (P1-18), and
examined the subcellular localization of these fusion proteins by
ﬂuorescence microscopy. Like wild-type peptide-fused GFP pro-
teins, GFP proteins with S9A mutant peptide exhibited almost
complete mitochondrial localization (Fig.4e, f, and Supplementary
Fig. 6h, i). Strikingly, inhibition of mitochondrial protein transloca-
tion by treatment with carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazine
(CCCP) or dequalinium chloride (DECA), whether wild-type or
mutant ME2ﬂ, or GFP fused with the S9A mutant peptide, resulted in
blocked mitochondrial localization of these proteins (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7a–d). Consistent with the aboveﬁndings, co-expression
with AKT1 led to cytoplasmic accumulation of wild-type ME2ﬂ, but
not the S9A mutant (Fig.4g). Furthermore, the interaction between
AKT1 and ME2ﬂ was able to be detected in the cytoplasm but not in
the mitochondrial fraction (Fig.2f). Taken together, theseﬁndings
suggest that Ser 9 phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ by AKT1 prevents ME2ﬂ
mitochondrial translocation, anchoring ME2ﬂ in the cytoplasm.
Phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ induces a metabolic switch towards
glycolysis
PTEN silencing in both HepG2 cells and PC9 cells resulted in increased
glycolysis and decreased TCA cycle activity, as revealed by isotope
tracing experiments (Supplementary Fig. 8a–f). This, together with the
unexpected discovery of cytoplasmic ME2ﬂ,p r o m p t e du st oi n v e s t i -

end, we conducted immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analysis

(Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, analysis of the
immunoprecipitants by western blotting revealed that ME2ﬂS9D was
able to bind to more than half of the glycolytic enzymes, except for
PGAM, TPI, and PGK1 (Fig.5a).
To examine whether this occurs endogenously, we developed an
anti-ME2ﬂ antibody that speciﬁcally recognizes ME2ﬂ but not ME2m,
as veriﬁed by immunoprecipitation, gene silencing and mitochondrial
translocation inhibition experiments (Supplementary Fig. 9a –e).
Notably, interactions between ME2ﬂ and glycolytic enzymes PFKL,

(Fig. 5b). In agreement with this, forced expression ME2ﬂS9D resulted
in augmented enzymatic activities of these enzymes in 293T cells
(Supplementary Fig. 9f). Similarly, HCT116 cells stably expressing
ME2ﬂS9D displayed increased enzymatic activities of PFKL, GAPDH,
PKM2 and LDHA (Fig.5c). Thus, theseﬁndings indicate that the cyto-
plasmic ME2ﬂ may have a role in modulating glycolysis via acting on its
multiple enzymes. Indeed, compared to those transfected with wild-
type ME2ﬂ or S9A mutants, cells forcibly expressing ME2ﬂS9D exhib-
ited strongly increased glycolyticﬂux as determined by measuring
extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) under conditions where glucose
was sequentially supplied to the cells to promote glycolysis, the ATP
synthase inhibitor oligomycin to drive glycolysis to its maximum
capacity, and the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) to block
glycolysis (Fig. 5d). In addition, when cells expressed ME2ﬂS9D, a
reduction in their mitochondrial respiratory function was observed as
measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig.5e). Similarﬁndings
were observed in 293T cells expressing wild-type or mutant ME2ﬂ
(Supplementary Fig. 9g). In keeping with theseﬁndings, enforced
expression of ME2ﬂS9D, not the wild-type or the S9A mutant ME2ﬂ,
resulted in an elevation in the production of lactate and pyruvate
(Supplementary Fig. 9h). Theseﬁndings were further conﬁrmed by the
use of
13C-metabolicﬂux analysis. Compared to vector control cells or
cells expressing wild-type ME2ﬂ or ME2ﬂS9A, ME2ﬂS9D-expressing
cells showed an increased yield of13C-labeled glycolytic intermediates
derived from [U-13C6]glucose and a decreased detection of13C-labeled
TCA cycle metabolites when cells were cultured with [U-13C5]glutamine
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). Interestingly, the enhancement of glyco-
lysis by ME2ﬂ phosphorylation appears to be independent of ME1, as
ME1 depletion showed little effect (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b).
Interestingly, in addition to increasing NADH production by pro-
moting the glycolytic pathway, the S9D mutation also enhanced the
dehydrogenase capacity of ME2, resulting in more NADPH production
(Fig. 5f, g). Generally, NADPH can be used for reductive biosynthetic
reactions and neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In
keeping with this, a substantial reduction in ROS levels was observed in
cells expressing ME2ﬂS9D compared to those expressing wild-type
ME2ﬂ (Fig. 5h). In addition, low PH caused by increased lactate pro-
duction may also contribute to ROS accumulation. Taken together,
these results indicate that phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ triggers a switch
of cellular metabolism toward glycolysis and promotes the Warburg
effect.
ME2ﬂ assembles a glycolytic enzyme complex that enhances
catalytic efﬁciency
To gain further insight into how ME2ﬂ promotes glycolytic activity, we
investigated the possibility of ME2ﬂ assembly of complexes involving
these glycolytic enzymes, leading to an increase in the catalytic
efﬁciency of these enzymes. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that ME2ﬂ could form complexes with multiple glycolytic enzymes
including PFKL, GAPDH and PKM2, as well as a glycolytic-related
enzyme LDHA in HEK293T cells (Fig.5a), and in vitro using recombi-
nant proteins (Supplementary Fig. 12a). When ME2 ﬂ was over-
expressed in HEK293T cells, the S9A mutation prevented ME2ﬂ from
binding to any of these enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 12b).
Interestingly, co-precipitation of ME2ﬂ with each of these identi-
ﬁed glycolytic enzymes was found by sequential co-precipitation at
both exogenous (Supplementary Fig. 12c–g) and endogenous levels
(Fig. 5b, and Supplementary Fig. 12h–j). Notably, silencing of ME2 s-
trongly reduced the co-precipitation between these enzymes
(Fig. 6a–c). Subcellular distribution analyses of the glycolytic enzymes
using confocal microscopy further showed that there was signiﬁcant
colocalization between PFKL, GAPDH, PKM2, and LDHA, respectively,
and this effect was remarkably abolished in cells depleted of ME2
(Fig. 6d). Moreover, analyses using density gradient centrifugation
revealed that PFKL, GAPDH, PKM2, and LDHA were recovered within
the same high-mobility fractions, but these enzymes dispersed when
cells were depleted of ME2 (Fig.6e, fractions 8 and 9). Theseﬁndings
suggest that there is a high-molecular-weight complex between these
glycolytic enzymes, whose stoichiometry may be largely determined
by ME2ﬂ. In keeping with theseﬁndings, in prostate cancer tissues
derived fromPb-Cre
+PtenL/L mice, which were PTEN-deﬁcient and dis-
played accumulated ME2ﬂ, co-precipitation of ME2ﬂ with these gly-
colytic enzymes was also observed (Fig.6f).
The aboveﬁndings suggest that ME2ﬂ has an ability to facilitate
the association between PFKL, GAPDH, PKM2, and LDHA. Consistent
with this, in PTEN-depleted cells, in which ME2ﬂ was accumulated, an
increase in the catalytic activity of these glycolytic enzymes was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 12k). We further wanted to know if ME2
could promote glycolytic reactions in vitro by incubating the recom-
binant enzyme mixture with glucose-6-phosphate, adenosine dipho-
sphate (ADP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). ME2ﬂ
addition resulted in increased ATP, and intriguingly, decreased lactate
production (Supplementary Fig. 12l). This unexpectedﬁnding could be
due the non-canonical catalytic function of ME2 which produces
2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) by consuming the low pyruvate
generated
10.I n d e e d ,w h e nM E 2ﬂ was added to the reaction mixture, a
decrease in pyruvate levels and an increase in 2-HG production were
observed (Supplementary Fig. 12m). Nevertheless, these data indicate
that ME2ﬂ facilitates formation of a multi-protein complex of glyco-
lytic enzymes, resulting in enhanced catalytic efﬁciency.
Phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ by AKT1 promotes tumorigenesis
To examine the effect of cytoplasmic ME2ﬂ on oncogenic growth, we
evaluated anchorage-independent growth in soft agar medium.

Overexpression of ME2 ﬂS9D increased anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar (Supplementary Fig. 13a), an in vitro measure of
tumorigenicity.
To directly investigate the role of ME2ﬂ phosphorylation in the
growth of tumor cells in animals, we injected MDA-MB-231 cells
knocked-in with wild-type, S9A or S9D mutant ME2ﬂ into immune-
compromised mice. As shown in Fig.7a, expression of ME2ﬂS9D
signiﬁcantly increased the ability of the cells to produce tumors.
Similar ﬁndings were obtained using HCT116 cells expressing wild-
type, S9A or S9D mutant ME2ﬂ (Supplementary Fig. 13b). Consistent
with theﬁndings that ME2ﬂ accumulation increases glycolyticﬂux,
ME2ﬂS9D tumors displayed higher levels of glycolysis as probed

with 2-DG-750 (2-deoxyglucose-750) uptake (Fig. 7b). The 2-DG
ﬂuorescence intensity measures glucose uptake and phosphoryla-
tion. Consistent with this, liquid chromatography‐mass spectro-
metry metabolomics analysis showed a signiﬁcantly increased levels
of pyruvate and lactate in tumors derived ME2ﬂS9D-expressing
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.7c).
To further explore the role of ME2ﬂ phosphorylation by AKT1 in
tumorigenesis in vivo, we used age-matched and genetic background-
matched Pb-Cre-PtenL/L mice as controls to monitor tumor develop-
ment in thePb-Cre+PtenL/L prostate cancer model26,27 (Supplementary
Fig. 13c). Compared to control animals,Pb-Cre+PtenL/L mice developed
a severe prostate cancer phenotype 9 weeks after birth (Fig.7d, e), and
IHC staining showed that the levels of S473 phosphorylation of AKT1
were increased in cancer tissues ofPb-Cre
+PtenL/L mice (Fig.7f). Nota-
bly, expression of ME2ﬂ and phosphorylated ME2ﬂ was clearly higher
in Pb-Cre+PtenL/L cancer tissues related to those of control mice (Fig.7f).
Moreover, Pb-Cre+PtenL/L tumors showed higher levels of glycolysis
(Fig. 7g) and increased enzymatic activity of the ME2ﬂ-structurally
associated glycolytic enzymes PFKL, GAPDH, and PKM2, as well as
LDHA (Fig. 7h). Collectively, theseﬁndings demonstrate that phos-
phorylation and cytoplasmic accumulation of ME2 ﬂ is strongly
tumorigenic and is likely an important mechanism underlying the
effect of AKT1 in tumor cells.
In addition, knocking down PTEN led to strong elevation in tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. 13d, e). Yet, silencing of ME2 apparently
reduced the tumor growth derived form PTEN-depleted cells (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13d, e), further reinforcing the importance of ME2 in
AKT1-mediated tumor growth.
Discussion
ME2 converts malate to pyruvate and is required for NADPH produc-
tion. ME2 is an oncoprotein that promotes tumor cell proliferation and
limits cellular senescence in the context of the genetic background of
wild-type p53
6. In tumor cells bearing p53 mutations, ME2 maintained
the stability of the mutant p53 via 2-HG10. Interestingly, in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), ME2 is lost concurrently with SMAD4
deletion in ~25% of cases
12,28. Here, we discovered a previously unrec-
ognized mechanism by which tumor cells coordinate glycolysis and
the mitochondrial TCA cycle via AKT1-mediated ME2 phosphorylation.
It has been long recognized that ME2 is a NAD
+/NADP+-associated
mitochondrial metabolic enzyme that functionally adjusts the TCA
cycle by converting malate, a TCA cycle intermediate, to pyruvate.
Activation of AKT1 by growth signaling stimulation led us to the dis-
covery of functional ME2 in the cytoplasm (namely as ME2ﬂ). AKT1
phosphorylates ME2ﬂ at serine 9, preventing ME2ﬂ from translocating
to the mitochondria and thus allowing it to remain in the cytoplasm.
Thus, the previously widely recognized ME2 protein is actually a
truncated form of ME2ﬂ protein with the N-terminal signal peptide
missing.
The phosphorylation site (Ser 9) on ME2 is arginine-rich and
matches the known substrate targeting motif of AKT, as well as the
motif of S6K (a major downstream kinase of AKT). Consistent with this,
supplying cells with S6K1 inhibitors, PF4708671 or LY2584702,
reduced the phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ insulin-treated cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 14a). Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 strongly sup-
pressed S6K1 and AKT, resulting in blocked ME2ﬂ phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 14a). Interestingly, when co-expressed in HEK293
cells, S6K1 formed a complex with ME2ﬂ (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c).
And, like AKT1, introduction S6K1 led to a strong phosphorylation of
ME2ﬂ (Supplementary Fig. 14d). Notably, S9A mutation almost com-
pletely abolished the phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ by S6K1 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14e), indicating that Ser 9 on ME2ﬂ is also a phosphorylation
site of S6K1. Thus, S6K1 may act in concert with AKT on ME2ﬂ,b u tt h e
detailed regulatory mechanisms, as well as how ME2 ﬂ is post-
translationally regulated beyond phosphorylation, need to be further
investigated.
The two cysteines on ME2ﬂ adjacent to Ser 9 (Cys12 and Cys16)
appear to be oxidisable, which may affect ME2 entry into mitochondria
by introducing negative charges similar to those of phosphorylation. In
support of this, ME2ﬂC12SC16S (which abolishes oxidation of both
cysteines) was found almost exclusively in mitochondria, whereas the
C12DC16D mutation (which mimics the oxidation of both sites fol-
lowed by the introduction of a negative charge) almost completely
prevented ME2ﬂ from entering the mitochondria (Supplementary
Fig. 14f, g). Intriguingly, similar to ME2ﬂ, expression of either mutant
reduced intracellular ROS levels (Supplementary Fig. 14h). Thus, oxi-
dation of these cysteines might affect the subcellular localization of
ME2ﬂ, and possibly also redox homeostasis by balancing oxidation-
mediated counteraction of ROS and suppression of TCA cycle-
mediated ROS scavenging, in addition to glycolysis and NADPH
synthesis. Certainly, more in-depth studies are required to verify this.
Malic enzyme pathway is a major source of NADPH in certain
types of tumor cells and proliferating cells
6,29, and is responsible for
more than half of the NADPH production in differentiated 3T3-L1
mouse adipocytes
13,30. Here, we found that ME2ﬂ phosphorylation also
shows increased ability to generate NADPH, and correspondingly
decreased cellular ROS levels, suggesting that ME2ﬂ may potentate
NADPH production in response to oncogenic PI3K signaling. As one of
the most compelling tumor and metabolic regulators
14,31,32, AKT has
been reported to play an important role in NADPH metabolism, in
addition to regulating many different metabolic pathways and meta-
bolic adaptations
14,18. AKT1 phosphorylates NADK and promotes the
production of NADP+, which in turn promotes NADPH production15.
Consistent with this study, ourﬁndings support the induction of
Fig. 3 | AKT1 phosphorylates ME2ﬂ at serine 9 and enhances its activity. aMass
spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated 5’Flag-ME2ﬂ from 293T cells

NADPH production by AKT, but through an alternative mechanism of
ME2ﬂ phosphorylation. Together, therefore, theseﬁndings suggest
how AKT1 coordinates biosynthesis and antioxidant defense.
Importantly, ME2ﬂ can form complex with multiple key glycolytic
enzymes, including the rate-limiting enzymes PFKL and PKM2. By
promoting the assembly of a glycolytic complex of PFKL, GAPDH,
P K M 2 ,a n dL D H A ,M E 2ﬂ enhances the activity of these enzymes,
leading to increased glycolyticﬂux, although the exact mechanism of
action of ME2ﬂ remains to be elucidated. Theseﬁndings suggest that
ME2ﬂ may have a scaffolding role in bridging glycolytic enzymes and
contribute to the Warburg effect in response to growth factor stimuli.

mutations at serine 9, we found that phosphorylated ME2ﬂ has sig-
niﬁcantly attenuated mitochondrial metabolism, suggesting that AKT1
directly regulates the transition between intracellular glycolysis and
mitochondrial metabolism by altering the phosphorylation status of
ME2. Theseﬁndings not only reveal a previously unappreciated cyto-
plasmic ME2 with an important regulatory role in glycolysis, but also
demonstrate that AKT1 is a metabolic switch for tumor cell prolifera-
tion in response to growth stimuli.
In this study, we found that growth factor stimulation induces
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of ME2ﬂ, a form of ME2 that is virtually
undetectable in the absence of stimulation (which is probably why we
have not found this cytoplasmic form to exist to date). Phosphoryla-
tion of ME2ﬂ on Ser 9 by AKT1 upon growth stimulation anchors ME2ﬂ
in the cytosol and the accumulation of ME2ﬂ leads to an increase in
glycolytic activity, causing a Warburg effect in cancer cells and pro-
moting cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 15). In addition to its
tumor-promoting effects, it may also play a role in some proliferating
cells (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells, etc.), as these rapidly proliferating
cells also tend to be highly glycolytic. Thus, it would be of interest to
further elucidate what physiological functions this newly discovered
form of cytoplasmic ME2 has in addition to its tumor-promoting
effects in PTEN-deﬁcient or AKT-activated tumors. Nevertheless, our
ﬁndings provide a previously unappreciated perspective and clue to
understanding the pro-oncogenic function of AKT and the Warburg
effect in cancer cells.

232100) in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween (TBST) was used to
block the membrane before probing with indicated antibodies in 5%
BSA in TBST at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBST and
then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit sec-
ondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min and developed with
ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Tanon, 180-5001).
For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in IP Lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 5 mM EDTA, 1%
sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for
10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1 mg) were incubated with the indi-
cated antibody (1–2 μg) for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incu-
bation with Protein A/G sepharose beads (Abcam, ab193259). Beads
were washed 3 times with IP Lysis Buffer. Immunoprecipitants were
eluted with 3Flag peptide for protein puriﬁcation or 0.1 M glycine (pH
2.5) at 100 ×g for 5–10 min followed by neutralization with 100 mM
Tris buffer for immunoblotting analysis.
Puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins
For Flag-tagged proteins puriﬁcation, HEK293T cells were transfected

5’Flag-ME2ﬂS9A and pRK5-5’Flag-ME2ﬂS9D), respectively. 36 h after
transfection, cells were collected and lysed in IP Lysis Buffer with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min and centrifuged at
13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Flag M2 afﬁnity gel was added into the
supernatants to immunoprecipitate Flag-tagged recombinant pro-
teins. After overnight incubation, Immunoprecipitants were washed 3
times with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
TritonX-100), followed by competitive elution with appropriate syn-

pGEX-6P-1-5’GST-ME2ﬂWT, pGEX-6P-1-5’GST-ME2ﬂS9A or pGEX-6P-1-
5’GST-ME2ﬂS9D plasmids were transformed into BL21/DE3. Transfor-
mants were ampliﬁed in 5 mL LB medium (containing 100μg/mL
ampicillin) and grown overnight at 37 °C to stationary phase. 1 mL
medium with ampliﬁed transformants was then inoculated into new LB
medium. The cultures were grown at 25 °C to an OD600 of∼0.6 before
inducing with 0.3 mM IPTG for 12 h. Cell pellets were collected,
resuspended in 50 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF), and lysed by sonication before
centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then
incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 12 h at 4 °C. Beads were
washed extensively with lysis buffer 3 times before eluting for 1 h in

LDH enzymatic activity. Cells were lysed and protein concentra-
tion was determined as previously described. The LDH enzymatic
assay was performed in LDH reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,

as agarose base. Cells were trypsinized and suspended DMEM sup-
plemented with 20% FBS and 0.3% agarose and plated on 0.6% agarose
base previously described (1000 cells per well). Cells were then cul-
tured in a 5% CO

subcutaneously into theﬂanks of 4 to 5-week-old athymic Balb-c nu/nu
male mice (Huafukang, Beijing). 2 weeks after implantation, tumors
were photographed and weighed. All the procedures performed in this
study were approved by the Tsinghua University Animal Care and Use
Committee (TUACUC). All the tumors ’ sizes didn’te x c e e dt h e

the Tsinghua University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mass spectrometry analysis
For identiﬁcation of proteins that may interact with phosphorylated
ME2ﬂ, HEK293T cells were transfected with 3’Flag tagged phospho-
mimic ME2ﬂS9D (pRK5-ME2ﬂS9D-3’Flag) with Lipofectamine 2000.
36 h after transfection, cells were lysed with IP lysis buffer supple-
mented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were
immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 Afﬁnity gel. The immunopre-
cipitants were eluted and separated using SDS-PAGE gel and stained by
Coomassie blue. Gel bands of interest were excised and digested in gel
with modiﬁed sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM ammo-
nium bicarbonate buffer overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were
extracted twice with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile aqu-
eous solution for 30 min. The extracts were centrifuged and dried in a
speedVac system. Peptides extracted were dissolved in 0.1% tri-
ﬂuoroacetic acid and analyzed by a high-sensitivity LC–MS/MS with an
Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). Proteins
identiﬁcation results were analyzed by searching the fragment spectra
against the UniProt protein database (EMBL-EBI) using the Mascot
search engine (v.2.3; Matrix Science) with the Proteome Discoverer
software program (v.1.4; ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc).
For identiﬁcation of phosphorylation site(s), HEK293T cells were
transfected 5’Flag tagged ME2ﬂ (pRK5-5’Flag-ME2ﬂ) together with HA
tagged control vector or AKT1. 36 h after transfection, cells were har-
vested and lysed in IP Lysis Buffer with phosphatase and protease

inhibitors. After immunoprecipitation by Flag M2 Afﬁnity gel, phos-
phorylated ME2ﬂ proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE gel. The
proteins were excised and digested in gel with modiﬁed sequencing-
grade trypsin. Digested peptides were separated by a 60-min gradient
elution at aﬂow rate of 0.3μL·min−1 with the Dionex/Thermo UltiMate
3000 HPLC System that was directly interfaced with Orbitrap Fusion
mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). The analytical column
was a homemade fused silica capillary column (75μmI D ,1 5 0 m m
length) packed with C-18 resin (300 A, 5μm). Mobile phase A consisted
of 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 80% acetonitrile
and 0.08% formic acid. The Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer was
operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using Xcalibur
4.0.27.10 software and there is a single full-scan mass spectrum in the
Orbitrap (300–1800m/z, 17,500 resolution) followed by four targeted
tandem mass spectrometry scans at 30% normalized collision energy.
Static peptide modiﬁcations included carbamidomethylation (C),
dynamic oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (S, T and Y). One trypsin
missed cleavage was allowed. Precursor tolerance and ion fragment
tolerance were set at 20 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. Conﬁdence
levels were set to 1% FDR (high conﬁdence) and 5% FDR (middle
conﬁdence).
Edman N terminal sequencing
HEK293T cells transfected with pRK5-5’Flag-ME2ﬂ or pRK5-ME2ﬂ-3’Flag
were lysed with IP lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag
M2 afﬁnity gel (A2220, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipi-
tations were washed three times with IP lysis buffer and eluted with
0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5) at 100 ×g for 5–10 min followed by neutralization
with 100 mM Tris buffer for immunoblotting analysis. After boiling in
SDS-loading buffer at 100 °C for 15 min, samples were separated on an
SDS–PAGE gel before being transferred to a polyvinylideneﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane in 3-clohexylaminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS)
buffer at pH 11.0. Proteins on the membrane were located by staining
with 1% Coomassie blue for 1 min, followed by destaining in 50%
methanol. The N-terminal fragments were sequenced by Edman
degradation peptide sequencing (PPSQ-33A, Shimadzu) andﬁve cycles
were set. The amino acid sequences of samples were determined by
comparing chromatograms and identifying the phenylthiohydantoin
amino acids that had the greatest increase in abundance. The
N-terminal sequence of protein was read up to 10 amino-acid residues.
Protein N terminal sequencing by mass spectrometry
HEK293T cells were transfected with pRK5-5’Flag-ME2ﬂ or pRK5-ME2ﬂ-

at room temperature. The cell samples wereﬁnally ﬁxed in PFA buffer
for 10 min at room temperature and stored in PBS at 4 °C. The images
were scanned by a super resolution microscope (N-SIM S, Nikon)
ME2ﬂ knock-in cell lines
Genomic mutations were performed using the CRISPR–Cas9 system.
Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the genomic area adjacent to
mutation site (ME2ﬂS9A and ME2ﬂS9D) was designed using the
CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/). The annealed oligonu-
cleotides were inserted into a PX330-GFP vector digested with BbsI
restriction enzyme. Both upstream and downstream of the donor
nucleotides were 350 bp away from mutation site and the donor oli-
gonucleotides were inserted into a pUC57 vector. SgRNA and donor
plasmids were co-transfected with a 1:1 ratio (1μgs g R N Aa n d1μg
donor plasmids) into MDA-MB-231 cells at 70% conﬂuence in a 6 cm
cell culture plate. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypinzed and GFP
positive cells were sorted by FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dick-
inson) for GFP positive single cell and seeded in 96-well plates. The
sgRNA sequence targeting ME2ﬂ was 5′-TGAAAGAAAAGATGTTGT
CC-3′.

The lower-case letters in the donor sequences indicated the
mutated nucleotides that will replace the endogenous nucleotides in
the genomic DNA.
Genotyping was performed by sequencing PCR products ampli-
ﬁed from the following primers. The forward primer sequence was 5′-
CACCTTCGCCTCTTGTTACC-3′ and the reverse primer sequence was
5′-CTACAAAAATATGTCACACCTTATC-3′.
Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation
3%–55% continuous sucrose gradient was prepared in a centrifuge buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 50 mM HEPES-KOH and 2 mM
EDTA in ultracentrifuge tubes. 0.4 mL of a 1:1 mixture of cell lysate with
3% sucrose solution was loaded on a total of 2 mL gradient solution. The
samples were centrifugated at 214,000 ×g for 4.5 h (TSL-55 rotor,
Beckman ultracentrifuge). Twelve equal volume fractions were collected
and subjected to Western Blot analysis after centrifugation.
In vitro glycolysis analysis
Flag-tagged PGI, PFKL, ALDOA, TPI, GAPDH, PGK, PGAM, ENO, PKM2,
and LDHA proteins were puriﬁed from HEK293T cells and incubated in
the glycolytic assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM MgCl
2,
2m MK3PO4, 1 mM G6P, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM NAD+, 1 mM NADH
in the presence of bacterially puriﬁed control GST-Vector or GST-
ME2ﬂ. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by
adding a 1:1 mix of methanol with acetonitrile (ACN) and the meta-
bolites were analyzed by LCMS.
Statistics and reproducibility
Sample sizes were chosen based on previous publications and were
sufﬁcient for statistical analysis. No data were excluded from analysis.
Animals were randomly assigned to each group. Randomization was
not required for biochemical and in vitro experiments. Cellular and
biochemical experiments were not blinded. All statistical data are
presented as means ± SD. The statisticalP values were obtained using
the GraphPad Prism software 9.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc. USA). Tests
performed withP < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Sta-
tistical signiﬁcance is shown as * P <0 . 0 5 , * *P <0 . 0 1 , * * *P < 0.001,
***P < 0.0001.
