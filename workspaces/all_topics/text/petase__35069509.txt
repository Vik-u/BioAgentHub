Certain members of the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are known to degrade
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Here, we describe the ﬁrst functional PET-active
enzymes from the Bacteroidetes phylum. Using a PETase-speciﬁc Hidden-Markov-
Model- (HMM-) based search algorithm, we identiﬁed several PETase candidates from
Flavobacteriaceae and Porphyromonadaceae. Among them, two promiscuous and
cold-active esterases derived from Aequorivita sp. (PET27) and Kaistella jeonii (PET30)
showed depolymerizing activity on polycaprolactone (PCL), amorphous PET foil and on
the polyester polyurethane Impranil
R⃝
DLN. PET27 is a 37.8 kDa enzyme that released
an average of 174.4 nmol terephthalic acid (TPA) after 120 h at 30◦C from a 7 mg PET
foil platelet in a 200 µl reaction volume, 38-times more than PET30 (37.4 kDa) released
under the same conditions. The crystal structure of PET30 without its C-terminal Por-
domain (PET30 1PorC) was solved at 2.1 Å and displays high structural similarity
to the IsPETase. PET30 shows a Phe-Met-Tyr substrate binding motif, which seems
to be a unique feature, as IsPETase, LCC and PET2 all contain Tyr-Met-Trp binding
residues, while PET27 possesses a Phe-Met-Trp motif that is identical to Cut190.
Microscopic analyses showed thatK. jeonii cells are indeed able to bind on and colonize
PET surfaces after a few days of incubation. Homologs of PET27 and PET30 were
detected in metagenomes, predominantly aquatic habitats, encompassing a wide range
of different global climate zones and suggesting a hitherto unknown inﬂuence of this
bacterial phylum on man-made polymer degradation.

Zhang et al. PET-Hydrolyzing Esterases From Bacteroidetes
INTRODUCTION
PET is one of the major plastic pollutants found in landﬁlls,
oceans and other environments (Jambeck et al., 2015; Geyer
et al., 2017). Our knowledge of microbial degradation of most
plastics is rather limited, but recent research has demonstrated
that some bacteria are able to degrade PET (Yoshida et al., 2016).
Although it is unclear if larger crystalline ﬁbers are degraded
by bacteria, it is well known that some cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74),
lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) and carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) can act
on amorphous and low crystalline PET. These enzymes, often
referred to as “PETases, ” cleave the ester bond of the polymer
to either produce bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET),
mono-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) or they complete
degradation to terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).
TPA monomers can be further degraded via cleavage of the
aromatic ring structure using known aryl pathways and can then
enter the β-ketoadipate pathway (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017;
Danso et al., 2019; Wright et al., 2021).
To date, only a limited number of bacterial and fungal
species have been identiﬁed that are capable of breaking down
PET to either its oligomers or monomers, TPA and EG. Most
bacterial isolates with veriﬁed enzymatic PET-degrading activity
are aﬃliated with the Gram-positive phylum Actinobacteria
(Acero et al., 2011). The best characterized examples belong to
the genera Thermobiﬁda or Thermomonospora (Kleeberg et al.,
1998; Chen et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2010; Acero et al., 2011; Ribitsch
et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2014). Further, the leaf compost-derived
cutinase LCC is closely related to Actinobacterial enzymes and
is currently one of the best described and most active PETases
(Sulaiman et al., 2012, 2014). Regarding Proteobacteria, the
Gram-negative Betaproteobacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6
is capable of using amorphous PET as a major energy and
carbon source (Yoshida et al., 2016). I. sakaiensis’ genome also
encodes a tannase which is designated MHETase as it is capable
of degrading MHET. Besides, a number of other PETases aﬃliated
with the Proteobacteria have been identiﬁed originating from e.g.,
Pseudomonas aestusnigri and Vibrio gazogenes (Ronkvist et al.,
2009; Haernvall et al., 2017; Danso et al., 2018; Bollinger et al.,
2020).
In a previous study, we identiﬁed potential PET esterases
aﬃliated with the Bacteroidetes phylum using HMM proﬁle
database searches (Danso et al., 2018, 2019). These enzyme
hits mainly occurred in metagenomes and genomes from
marine environments and were annotated solely on the
basis of homology. However, their enzymatic function and
environmental distributions have not been studied within that
framework, and we target these questions in the present study.
Bacteroidetes representatives can be found in nearly all ecological
niches including soils, oceans and fresh water and are part of
the microbiome of many animals, especially as inhabitants of the
intestinal tract (Wexler, 2007; Krieg et al., 2015; Hahnke et al.,
2016; Munoz et al., 2016). The Bacteroidetes phylum, however,
is highly heterogeneous and contains at least four classes of
bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidia, Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteria, and
Cytophagia), with each class having several thousand described
species. The phylum contains non-spore forming and rod shaped
microorganisms, some aerobic, but often anerobic, with an
enormous metabolic diversity (Krieg et al., 2015). The global
distribution of Bacteroidetes representatives is likely due to their
ability to decompose a very wide variety of bio-based polymers
such as cellulose, chitin or algal cell walls. In particular, the
decomposition of polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose)
by Bacteroidetes inhabiting the intestinal tract of humans and
animals has been well-studied in gut microbiome research
(Thomas et al., 2011).
Here, we provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence that
diﬀerent Bacteroidetes representatives have evolved promiscuous
esterases that degrade the PET polymer. We show that at least
two Bacteroidetes genera, Aequorivita and Kaistella (formerly
Chryseobacterium), harbor PET-active enzymes and elucidated
the crystal structure of PET30. These enzymes have relatively
low turnover rates, indicating that PET hydrolysis may be a side
reaction. Still, given their abundance and diversity, we speculate
that the described bacteroidetal PET-active enzymes could have
considerable impact on long-term degradation of PET in the
marine environment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Primers
Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 , 2. If not mentioned
otherwise, Escherichia coli clones were grown in LB medium (1%
tryptone/peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) supplemented
with appropriate antibiotics (25 µg/ml kanamycin, or 100 µg/ml
ampicillin) at 37◦C for 18 h.
Databases Used in This Study and
Bioinformatic Analyses
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of putative and conﬁrmed
PETases were acquired from databases integrated into the NCBI1,
UniProt2 and IMG (JGI) 3 servers (Markowitz et al., 2012; NCBI
Resource Coordinators, 2017; The UniProt Consortium, 2017).
Human gut sequences were retrieved from the Uniﬁed Human
Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog (PMID: 32690973).
Sequences were compared to others deposited in the NCBI
databases using BLAST alignment tools (Agarwala et al., 2016).
Amino acid sequence HMM search was carried out using the
HMMER4 webpage or a local version of the software (v3.1b2)
(Mistry et al., 2013) with downloaded datasets. Structural
information on the enzymes was retrieved from the RCSB-PDB
(Berman et al., 2000) database.
Sequence data were processed and analyzed using
ChromasPro 2.1.8 (Technelysium, Brisbaine Australia) or
SnapGene (GSL Biotech LLC, San Diego CA, United States).
Amino acid alignment was constructed using structural
alignments with T-Coﬀee (Notredame et al., 2000) and was

further visualized with Bioedit (Hall, 1999). The model structures
of bacteroidetal PETase-candidates were modeled with the
Robetta server (Kim et al., 2004) using the IsPETase crystal
structure (6EQE) as a backbone. A phylogenetic tree was
constructed using the RAxML-NG autoMRE algorithm (Kozlov
et al., 2019) with the treesapp create command implemented in
TreeSAPP (Morgan-Lang et al., 2020) with maximum bootstraps
set at 1,000. RAxML-MG has recently been shown to return
the best scoring tree for highest number of datasets when
compared against other fast maximum likelihood (ML) methods
(Kozlov et al., 2019), allowing a large number of maximum
bootstraps to be used to produce as conservative a tree as
possible. Sequences were assigned NCBI lineages according to
source organisms listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3,
and colors were assigned to the tree at the phylum level using
the treesapp color command. The tree was visualized in iTOL
(Letunic and Bork, 2019).
Scanning IMG/M was completed on 19/November/2020
for PET30 and on 14/January/2021 for PET27. Geo locations
were used as provided whenever available. In case no Geo
location was available, whenever possible, information about
isolation source/location/city/country were used to look up Geo
coordinates on GeoHack. 5 The map representing the frequency
and geographical distribution of PET hydrolases in metagenomes
(Figure 1) was constructed using QGis Desktop 2.18.56.
Heterologous Expression of Putative
Polyethylene Terephthalate Esterase
Genes in Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3)
The putative PETases were extracted from metagenomic datasets
(Table 1 ), therefore the gene sequences were optimized for
expression in E. coli and synthesized into pET21a( +) vector at
Biomatik (Wilmington, United States). The obtained constructs
were sequenced at Microsynth Seqlab GmbH (Goettingen,
Germany) and checked for correctness by comparing to the
original sequences. E. coli T7-Shuﬄe or E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells
were used for heterologous expression of possible PETases. The
IsPETase gene in pMAL-p4x was expressed in E. coli BL21 and
puriﬁed by its maltose-binding tag. The cultures were grown
aerobically in auto-induction medium (ZYM-5052) (Studier,
2005) containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37◦C until they reached
an OD 600 of 1.0. The proteins were expressed afterward at
22◦C for 16–20 h. The cells were harvested and lysed with
pressure using a French press. Afterward, the proteins harboring
a sixfold C-terminal histidine tag were puriﬁed with nickel-ion
aﬃnity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The elution buﬀer was
exchanged against 0.1 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer pH 8.0 in
a 10 kDa Amicon Tube (GE Health Care, Solingen, Germany).
Biochemical Characterization of PET27
and PET30
For activity tests, both enzymes were assayed using puriﬁed
recombinant protein. bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET)
5https://geohack.toolforge.org
6http://www.qgis.org
and polycaprolactone (PCL) agar plates were prepared as
described elsewhere (Pérez-García et al., 2021). The polyester
polyurethane Impranil DLN containing LB agar plates were
prepared according to Molitor et al. (2020) with LB medium.
For the pNP-assay, unless otherwise indicated, a total amount
of 0.1–1 µg of the enzymes were added to a substrate solution
containing 190 µl of either 0.2 M sodium phosphate buﬀer or
0.1 M potassium phosphate with a deﬁned pH between 7 and
8 and 10 µl of 0.1 mM pNP-substrate dissolved in isopropanol.
After incubating the samples for 10 min, the assay was stopped
by adding 200 mM of Na 2CO3. Afterward, the samples were
centrifuged at 4 ◦C, 13,000 rpm for 3 min. As substrates, pNP-
esters with chain lengths of C4, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, C16
and C18 were tested. After incubation at deﬁned temperatures,
the color change from colorless to yellow was measured at
405 nm in a plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, United States). All
samples were measured in triplicate. To determine the optimal
temperature, samples were incubated between 10 and 90 ◦C
for 10 min. The inﬂuence of pH conditions on the activity
of each enzyme was measured in citrate phosphate (pH 3.0,
4.0, and 5.0), potassium phosphate (pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) and
carbonate bicarbonate buﬀer (pH 9.2 and 10.2). The impact
of cofactors, solvents, detergents, and inhibitors was assayed
at diﬀerent concentration levels. The possible cofactors Ca 2+,
Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Rb2+, and Zn 2+with a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 and 10 mM were used. Detergent stability was
assayed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X-100 and
Tween 80 at 1 and 5% (w/v, v/v) concentration. The inhibitory
eﬀect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), dithiothreitol
(DTT) and phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) was tested
at 1 and 10 mM concentration. After 1 h incubation in the
presence of these substances, the residual activity was determined
after 10 min incubation at the optimal temperature with para-
nitrophenol- (pNP-) C6 and at the optimal pH.
For the veriﬁcation of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, a 7 mg
platelet (Ø 5 mm) of low-crystallinity PET ﬁlm (Goodfellow
GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany), which corresponds to 36.4
µmol of the terephthalic acid-ethylene glycol (TPA-EG) unit,
was folded in half and used as substrate together with 200 µg
of enzyme in 200 µl of 100 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer at
pH 8.0. Incubation was carried out under continuous shaking
at 400 rpm in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes at 30 ◦C, if not
stated otherwise.
Analysis of breakdown products was performed with an
UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC system from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
(Waltham, MA, United States) using a Triart C18 column
(YMC Europe GmbH, Dinslaken, Germany) with a dimension
of 100 ×2.0 mm containing particles with 1.9 µm diameter.
Isocratic elution was performed using a mobile phase consisting
of 20:80 (v/v) acetonitrile and water (acidiﬁed with 0.1% vol
triﬂuoroacetic acid) at a ﬂowrate of 0.4 ml min −1. UHPLC
samples were prepared by mixing 50µl of incubation supernatant
with 200 µl acetonitrile (acidiﬁed with 1% vol triﬂuoroacetic
acid), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min
and transferring 200 µl of the supernatant into 600 µl water.
Fifteen microliter of sample were injected per measurement
and detection was performed at 254 nm with a VWD-3400

The UHPLC proﬁles were plotted and edited using the software
MATLAB version R2020b [The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA,
United States (Matlab, 2012)]. Quantiﬁcation of peak areas
was performed using data analysis software supplied with
the Compass HyStar software package from Bruker (Billerica,
MA, United States).
Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystallization of PET30 1PorC was achieved by sitting-drop
vapor-diﬀusion at 12 ◦C. 0.2 µl of 10.2 mg/ml PET30 1PorC
in 100 mM phosphate buﬀer pH 8.0 and 0.1 µl reservoir
solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium aetate pH 4.6 and 25%
(w/v) PEG 4000 were mixed. This drop was equilibrated against
reservoir solution and crystals formed after several weeks.
Crystallization drops were overlayed with mineral oil and the
crystals were dragged through it for cryoprotection, ﬂash frozen
and diﬀraction data were collected at beamline P13 (DESY ,
Hamburg, Germany). The PET30 1PorC crystals had the space
group P 43 21 2 and diﬀracted to 2.1 Å resolution.
Structure Determination
A complete data set of the PET30 1PorC was collected at
beamline P13 (DESY , EMBL, Hamburg, Germany) at 100 K
and wavelength 0.9795 Å up to 2.1 Å resolution. All data were
processed using the automated pipeline at the EMBL HAMBURG
and reprocessed afterward using XDS (Kabsch, 2014). The
above obtained model for PET30 1PorC by TOPMODEL was
successfully used to phase the 2.1 Å data set of PET30 1PorC
using the PHASER program from the PHENIX program suite
(Afonine et al., 2012; Mulnaes et al., 2020). The structure was then
reﬁned in iterative cycles of manual building and reﬁnement in
coot followed by software-based reﬁnements using the program
suite Phenix (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004; Liebschner et al., 2019).
All residues were in the preferred and additionally allowed
regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection and
reﬁnement statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 4 . The
images of the models were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano,
2002) and UCSF Chimera X.7 The structure was deposited at the
worldwide protein data bank under the accession code 7PZJ.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy of
Polyethylene Terephthalate Foil Platelets
The starter culture of K. jeonii was grown in R2A medium
at 22 ◦C and 130 rpm to a cell density of 0.2. 1% of the
starter culture was inoculated into 30 ml fresh R2A medium
and PET foil platelets were put into the cultures. PET
platelets were removed after 5-7 days, washed three times
with PBS and subsequently given into µ-Slide 8 wells plates
from ibidi GmbH (Martinsried, Germany). Cells were stained
using 100 µl of LIVE/DEAD stain BacLight Viability Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The stain is composed of propidium
iodide (PI) dying dead cells with a damaged membrane and
causing red ﬂuorescence and green ﬂuorescence SYTO 9 TM
dying all bacterial membranes of living cells. Therefore, 10
µl PI and 10 µl SYTO 9 TM were mixed. 15 µl of the
nucleic acid-binding stains were pipetted into 5 ml PBS. The
PET platelets were incubated for 1 h in the dark at room
temperature. Afterward, the samples were investigated under
the microscope Axio Observer Z1/7, LSM 800 using objective
C-Apochromat 63x/1.20 W Korr UV VisIR (both Carl Zeiss
Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) using the Channels Syto

RESULTS
Proﬁle Hidden Markov Model Searches
Identify Potential Bacteroidetal PETases
Protein sequences from both genomes and metagenomes were
screened using the previously described Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) (Danso et al., 2018) to enrich the diversity of PET-
active enzymes from Bacteroidetes. The global searches were
performed in publicly available datasets of NCBI GenBank
and additionally in several private datasets harboring human-
associated and environmental Bacteroidetes sequences (Table 1).
Searches were conducted from January until March 2019.
This global search initially resulted in the identiﬁcation of
37 potential PETase sequences from Bacteroidetes with a bit
score above 298.7. After sequence comparison, nine distinct
hits were chosen. These candidates belonged to bacteroidetal
genomes originating from either Seaweed (Li et al., 2017),
Antarctic moss (Li et al., 2017), river sediment (Woyke et al.,
2011), an aquaculture (own unpublished dataset) or human
gut microbiomes (Mitchell et al., 2019; Almeida et al., 2021;
Table 1 ). Most of these candidates were aﬃliated with the
Flavobacteriaceae genus Aequorivita sp. (PET27-29, PET31 and
PET53). PET29 and PET31 were highly similar on amino
acid level ( < 98% identity) but diﬀered in the length of
their sequence by 10 amino acids (aa). PET30, annotated as
a potential lipase, was derived from the published genome
sequence of Kaistella jeonii NCTC 13459. The predicted PETases
PET57-59 were derived from bacteria aﬃliated with the genus
Porphyromonas sp. (Porphyromonadaceae), while the predicted
enzyme PET38 was derived from the species Fluviicola taﬀensis
(Cryomorphaceae).

The nine candidate genes of the predicted PETases were
synthesized, cloned into the expression vector pET21a( +)
(Biomatik, Wilmington, DA, United States) and transformed
in E. coli BL21 and T7-Shuﬄe cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ).
Initial tests using recombinant puriﬁed proteins and tributyrin
(TBT)-containing agar plates indicated that the genes PET27-
30 coded for active esterases. The remaining enzymes PET38,
PET53, PET57, and PET58 were inactive and were either
produced as insoluble proteins and/or only at very low amounts
(Table 1 ). Because of these obvious diﬃculties facing their
expression, these four predicted enzymes were not further
characterized. Additional tests with PET27-PET30 indicated that
these enzymes hydrolyzed the esters pNP-hexanoate (C6), and
pNP-decanoate (C10, Table 1). All four recombinant enzymes
were able to hydrolyze the polymeric polycaprolactone (PCL),
the PET-constituent BHET, and the polyester polyurethane
Impranil
R⃝DLN (Covestro AG, Leverkusen, Germany) ( Table 1
and Figure 2A ). The enzymes produced clear halos on agar
plates containing these substrates after overnight incubation at
30◦C (Figure 2A and Table 1). PET-hydrolyzing activities were
conﬁrmed for the enzymes PET27 and PET30 on amorphous PET
foil as substrate in a 200 µl reaction volume by UHPLC analyses.
In these tests, 1 mg ml −1 PET27 released 871.8 ±200.4 µM
(corresponds to 174.4 ±40.0 nmol in 200 µl reaction volume) of
TPA in 120 h at 30◦C from a 7 mg PET platelet. PET foil (7 mg)
corresponds to 36.4µmol of a TPA-EG monomer unit (Figure 2B
and Table 2). Surprisingly, under the same conditions, PET30
released only 15.9 ±9.5 µM TPA (corresponds to 3.2±1.9 nmol;
Figure 2C and Table 2). These results were directly benchmarked
with recombinant IsPETase, of which 1 mg ml −1 released under
the same conditions 4,055.7 ±516.9 µM of TPA (corresponds
to 811.1 ±103.4 nmol). Thus, IsPETase is 4.7-fold more active
compared to PET27 and approximately 253-fold more active
compared to PET30. Because of the relatively low turnover rates
observed for PET27 and PET30 on PET foil, it can be assumed
that PET is not the preferred substrate of both enzymes.
Biochemical Characterization and
Activity of PET27 and PET30 on Esterase
Substrates
Both recombinant enzymes were characterized in more detail
with pNP-esters. A substrate spectrum was recorded with pNP-
esters, which had acyl chain lengths of 4–18 C-atoms. PET27
and PET30 revealed a relatively narrow spectrum of substrates
they could hydrolyze. The highest activities were observed with
pNP-hexanoate (-C6) for PET30 and pNP-octanoate (-C8) for
PET27 (Figure 3A). The optimal temperature of PET30 is 30 ◦C,
but 80% activity was observed at 20 ◦C and between 40 and 50◦C
(Figure 3B ). In contrast to that, PET27 shows a better activity
at higher temperatures with an optimum at 40 ◦C and even 45%
activity at 90◦C. Surprisingly, at 10◦C, both enzymes still showed

The different recombinant and puriﬁed enzymes were incubated at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 for a time period of 120 h at 30◦C. For the tests a circular piece of 7 mg
PET foil which corresponds to 36.4 µmol of the TPA-EG unit (Ø 5 mm, and as speciﬁed in section “Materials and Methods”) was employed and folded once in the middle.
Incubations were carried out in a reaction volume of 200 µl. Data are mean values with standard deviations of a minimum of 3 and up to 6 measurements per sample.
a relative activity of 65% (PET30) and 73% (PET27). PET30
remained active at 4 ◦C showing a relative activity of 42% on
pNP-C6. Concerning the optimal pH, PET27 was most active
between pH 7–8 and PET30 between pH 6-8 when tested in 0.1
M potassium phosphate (Figure 3C).
To further characterize the eﬀects of metal ions, diﬀerent ions
(Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) were
added to the assays at 1 and 10 mM ﬁnal concentrations. Metal
ions have a minor inﬂuence on PET27. Addition of Ca2+resulted
in a 1.4-fold increase of the activity (Supplementary Figure 1A).
In case of PET30, addition of Zn 2+, Ni2+, and Co2+resulted in
an up to threefold increase of activity.
The kinetic parameters for PET27 and PET30 were
determined with pNP-C6 at 30 ◦C and pH 8 according to
Michaelis-Menten. Thereby, PET27 revealed a vmax of 4.9 nmol
min−1, a kcat of 19.08 s−1, a Km of 1.37 mM and a kcat/Km value
of 13,859.27 M −1 s−1. For PET30, we calculated a vmax of 2.3
nmol min −1, a kcat of 8.9 s −1, a Km of 0.3 mM and a kcat/Km
value of 26,136.11 M−1 s−1.
Further, PET30 was investigated in more detail. To assess
thermostability, the enzyme was incubated at 50 and 60◦C for 3 h,
after which the enzyme retained only 23 and 5% of its original
activity, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). As inhibiting
substances, EDTA, DTT and PMSF were applied in ﬁnal
concentrations of 1 and 10 mM (Supplementary Figure 1C). The
presence of DTT and PMSF (1 and 10 mM) inactivated PET30
almost completely, whereas EDTA at 1 and 10 mM had no large
impact on the enzyme’s activity. A concentration of 1 and 5 %
of the detergents Triton X-100, Tween 80 and SDS decreased
PET30’s activities (Supplementary Figure 1D).
As both enzymes were active at lower temperatures, PET
foil degradation was assayed at 4 ◦C. Over a time of 30 days in

a 200 µl reaction volume, TPA release was measured. Under
these conditions, 1 mg ml −1 of PET30 released an average
of 6.1 µM of TPA (corresponds to 1.2 nmol). Interestingly,
IsPETase released under the same conditions a similar amount
(5.9 µM TPA corresponds to 1.2 nmol). Notably, under these
conditions, no detectable amounts of TPA were released with
PET27 after 30 days.
Amino Acid Sequence and Structural
Analyses Identify Unique Traits of
Bacteroidetal Polyethylene
Terephthalate-Hydrolyzing Enzymes
While all four enzymes PET27-PET30 were able to hydrolyze
PCL, BHET and Impranil
R⃝DLN, only PET27 and PET30 were
able to depolymerize PET. To identify the key diﬀerences that
confer this activity on PET, all predicted PETases were studied
on sequence and structural level. With an average of 330 aa, the
predicted molecular weights of the enzymes ranged from 36 to
48 kDa. Each candidate contained a C-terminal signal domain
for protein transport to the periplasm as predicted with SignalP
5.0 (Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019), supporting the notion that
these are secreted proteins ( Table 3). Remarkably, the predicted
PETases PET27-PET30 and PET38 showed a type IX secretion
system (T9SS)/PorC-type sorting domain-containing part at the
C-terminus. It has been described earlier by a proﬁle HMM from
the TIGRFAM database (TIGR04183). T9SS sorting domains
are involved in protein transport across the bacterial outer
membrane and have so far been described as a Bacteroidetes-
speciﬁc secretion system (Sato et al., 2010; Shoji et al., 2011;
de Diego et al., 2016). The predicted domain encompassed 62–
64 aa in the cases of PET27-PET30 and PET38. PET57 and 58
carried truncated sorting domains of 42 and 55 aa in length.
This observation also implies that these enzymes are most likely
exoenzymes ( Table 3 and Supplementary Figures 3 , 4). To
ensure that this C-terminus does not aﬀect catalytic activity, a
deletion mutant designated PET301PorC was created that lacked
the sorting sequence between the amino acids 300–366. Activity
tests conﬁrmed that it was not aﬀected in its activities using pNP-
C6 or PET foil ( Supplementary Figure 1E and Table 2). The
enzyme released similar amounts of TPA as it was observed for
the native PET30 (Table 2).
Further analyses of the amino acid sequences identiﬁed a
G-x-S-x-G motif which is typical for α/β serine hydrolases
(Ollis et al., 1992) and a catalytic triad that consists of the
residues Asp-His-Ser ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 4 ).
Potential substrate binding sites in all bacteroidetal enzymes were
identiﬁed containing the aa Phe-Met-(Trp/Tyr/Ala). The latter
diﬀered from the known IsPETase, the LCC and PET2 binding
sites, in which a Tyr-Met-Trp motif is present ( Table 3). PET57
is the only exception with a Trp-Met-Tyr binding site. PET27,
however, has the Tyr replaced with a Phe that is identical to
Cut190, while PET30 has in addition the Trp in position 3
replaced with a Tyr (Table 3). This single amino acid substitution
in the predicted substrate binding pocket of PET30, however, is
not solely responsible for PET-degrading activity. The mutants

Structure Determination of PET30 and
Structural Modeling of the Other Putative
PETases
For structural insights into the mechanism of polymer
degradation, the structures of all predicted PETases, except
PET30, were modeled using the IsPETase (PDB code 6EQE)
as template. Crystallization was conducted with puriﬁed
PET301PorC and X-ray structure determination using a model
of PET30 for molecular replacement. The structure was solved
at 2.1 Å resolution, containing one monomer in the asymmetric

unit, with 16.2% for R work and 21.9% for R free. Data collection
and structure reﬁnement statistics are given in Supplementary
Table 4 . Coordinates of PET30 1PorC were deposited under
the PDB accession code 7PZJ. The PET30 1PorC protein shows
a canonical α/β-fold consisting of a central twisted β-sheet
composed of 9 β-strands ﬂanked by 7 α-helices on both sides
(Figure 4A ), as already reported for homologous structures,
i.e., PETases and cutinases (Han et al., 2017; Numoto et al.,
2018). The structure of PET30 1PorC revealed an extra β-sheet
(β10) which is located at the C-terminus and connects the PorC
domain which has been deleted in this construct. PET30 1PorC
represents the overall fold of several PETases as revealed by
a similarity search performed by PDBeFold. 8 Here, especially
the known structures of the PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis
(for example PDB code 5XH3; Han et al., 2017), show high
consistency indicated by the rmsd of 1.3-1.5 Å. Also, high
structural similarity can be seen with the structure of PE-H from
Pseudomonas aestusnigri (PDB code 6SCD rmsd 1.3) and the
cutinase from a member of the Burkhoderiales bacteria family
(PDB code 7CWQ, rmsd of 1.32 (Bollinger et al., 2020; Chen
et al., 2021). One disulﬁde bond is present in PET30 1PorC
(C262-C285), a common feature for Type II PET-degrading
enzymes (Joo et al., 2018). In the PETase from I. sakaiensis (PDB
code 5YNS), a second disulﬁde bond is present which is located
closely to the active site. Mutational analysis revealed that this
disulﬁde bond plays a crucial role in activity since mutation of
the involved cysteine to serine completely abolished activity,
likely due to a destabilizing eﬀect on the active site. The sequence
in PET30 1PorC at this position deviates, and here, G195 and
V232 are present. In the PE-H structure, also no disulﬁde
bridge can be found, although one cysteine residue remained
(G195 and C251). From the many structures of the PETase from
I. sakaiensis , one was solved in complex with 2-hydroxyethyl
methyl terephthalate (HEMT; PDB code 5XH3). Here, HEMT is
bound via interactions with W156, I179, H208, A131, W130, Y58,
and M132. We looked into the active site and overlaid the HEMT
molecule with our PET30 1PorC structure ( Supplementary
Figure 2). Here similar interactions of the HEMT molecule by
the PET30 1PorC protein can be deduced mediated by Y178,
T200, H230, W152, F80, and M154 (Figure 4B).
The largest diﬀerences can be seen in the C-terminal part
aﬃliated with the T9SS-domain. It diﬀered largely from the
IsPETase and consisted of up to seven predicted β-sheets and,
occasionally, a few α-helices ( Supplementary Figure 3A and
Table 3). Another diﬀerence between PET27, PET30, IsPETase
and LCC is the surface hydrophobicity of the region channeling
the substrates to the active site ( Figure 4C ). PET30 shows
a less hydrophobic surrounding of the catalytic pocket when
compared to the structures of Type I and Type II PET-degrading
enzymes (Joo et al., 2018). PET27 contains a bulkier hydrophobic
domain on one of the sides of the channel. This feature might
inﬂuence accommodation of the substrate and activity on the
polymers. A similar catalytic pocket was predicted for PET28
and PET29 (Supplementary Figure 3). Although active on BHET
and PCL, these enzymes showed no measurable activity on PET.

The enzymes derived from the human gut present a larger
hydrophobic surface around the catalytic site, especially PET58
and PET59 (Supplementary Figure 3B).
Bacteroidetal Polyethylene
Terephthalate-Degrading Esterases
Forming Two Phylogenetic Subclusters
Are Globally Occurring Enzymes
Using the amino acid sequences of published and functionally
veriﬁed PETases and employing the RAxML-NG autoMRE
algorithm via TreeSAPP (Morgan-Lang et al., 2020),
aphylogenetic analysis was performed. Multiple phylogenetic
clusters formed that roughly corresponded to Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Ascomycota ( Figure 5A). While
the putative and now conﬁrmed Bacteroidetal PET-degrading
hydrolases appear to be polyphyletic when added into the tree,
distinct subclusters were formed. Notably, the two enzymes
PET27 and PET30, shown to be active on PET foil, were
grouped as part of subcluster that consisted of predicted
and functional enzymes aﬃliated with genera Aequorivita
and Kaistella. Furthermore, the predicted but functionally not
veriﬁed enzymes from the genusPorphyromonas (PET57-PET59)
formed a separate subcluster. Interestingly, these two subclusters
harbored only sequences of aquatic and environmental origin
orgut-aﬃliated sequences, respectively. Overall, sequences
derived from Bacteroidetes seem to group by both taxonomy
and environment, though low bootstrap values do not show
a high degree of conﬁdence. However, the interleaving of
Bacteroidetal sequences from both a Firmicute, B. subtilis ,
and the eukaryotic Ascomycota sequences may suggest that
PET-active enzymes are widely distributed phylogenetically, and
further characterization studies resulting in additions to the tree
are likely to provide better phylogenetic resolution. Additionally,
the pairwise distance on the level computed in MEGAX with the
p-distance model ( Figure 5B) conﬁrmed these groupings, with
the highest similarity, as indicated by low pairwise distanced,
occurring within the subclusters described. This analysis also
indicated rather low similarity between the putative bacteroidetal
PETases and the known PETases ( IsPETase, LCC, PE-H, and
PET2), mounting further evidence for the wide phylogenetic
distribution of these enzymes.
The diversity of bacteroidetal enzymes acting on PET raised
the question to what extent these enzymes could impact plastic
degradation in the environment. To address this question in part,
we analyzed the global distribution of PET27 and PET30 and
their homologs. The protein sequences of PET27 and PET30
were analyzed for their occurrence and frequency in global
databases available in IMG/M ER (Woyke et al., 2011; Mukherjee
et al., 2020). Using both enzymes for a BLASTp-based search
(cutoﬀs 50% identity; 80% coverage), we were initially able to
identify very few (<10) possible homologs in the global databases
analyzed and aﬃliated with the genera Aequorivita and Kaistella
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, when we extended our search to the
Flavobacterium-Cytophaga-Bacteroidetes (FCB), we were able to
identify 98 possible homologs in our global searches including
single-cell ampliﬁed genomes (SAGs) from the Baltic Sea

(Supplementary Table 5). 47 hits were aﬃliated with the genus
of the Marinimicrobia (candidate phylum of the FCB group),
indicating a potential role for these ubiquitous and abundant
marine microorganisms in PET-degradation. Others were more
closely associated with Bacteroidetes (Austin et al., 2018). As
expected, the majority of these homologs were associated with
marine and aquatic samples (Figure 1B).
Kaistella jeoniiIs Able to Colonize
Polyethylene Terephthalate Surfaces
These metagenomic analyses showed that K. jeonii, the organism
from which PET30 originates, exists primarily in aquatic habitats.
To illustrate that it not only exists there, but is also able
to actively colonize PET surfaces, a culture of this organism
was incubated with PET foil platelets. The foil sections were
incubated for up to 1 week in R2A medium with K. jeonii ,
removed from the culture, and washed three times with buﬀer
before staining with LIVE/DEAD staining solution. Samples
were investigated under the confocal laser scanning microscope
Axio Observer Z1/7, LSM 800 by Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH
(Jena, Germany). Cells visible in Supplementary Figure 5
resisted repeated washing, indicating that they adhere under
these laboratory conditions to the surface and an increasing
number of cells was visible on the amorphous PET-foil after
5–7 days. The exact mechanism of attachment is not known.
Nonetheless, it can be speculated that SusD binding modules,
which are crucial for sugar polymer binding, could be involved.
They can be found in both genomes of K. jeonii (GenBank acc.
no. WP_039349586.1; RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer
membrane protein) and Aequorivita sp. CIP111184 (GenBank
acc. no. WP_111879847.1; SusD/RagB family nutrient-binding
outer membrane lipoprotein).
DISCUSSION
Currently, only a handful of known bacterial phyla are known
to produce active PET-esterases ( Figure 5 and Supplementary
Table 3). Here, we have identiﬁed and partially characterized
two novel functional PET-hydrolyzing enzymes aﬃliated with
the Kaistella and Aequorivita genera within the Bacteroidetes
phylum. Bacteria belonging to the genus Kaistella are globally
occurring aerobic organisms colonizing a wide range of diﬀerent
habitats including plants, soil, ﬁsh, the human gut, and sea
water. Within the genus Kaistella, over one hundred species
have been described of which few are pathogens, but many are
beneﬁcial and host-associated (Bernardet et al., 2005; Loch and
Faisal, 2015). Only a few species have been identiﬁed within the
genus Aequorivita, mainly belonging to marine or fresh-water
organisms that are mostly psychrotolerant and aerobic (Bowman
and Nichols, 2002). Notably, Bacteroidetes have been described as
very potent degraders of polymers, and they harbor a multitude
of hydrolases and binding modules (Dodd et al., 2011; Thomas
et al., 2011; Foley et al., 2016).
The enzymes PET27 and PET30 characterized here are both
typical esterases (i.e., serine hydrolases) belonging to the EC
3.1. Both appear to be secreted enzymes as they carry an
C-terminal secretion signal linked to the transport into the
periplasm (Desvaux et al., 2009) and one secretion PorC-
like motif which is related to the type IX secretion system
(T9SS) (Sato et al., 2010; de Diego et al., 2016). The T9SS is
composed of several outer membrane, periplasmic and inner
membrane proteins, whereby it is responsible for the secretion of
pathogenicity factors, hydrolases and also for gliding motility in
the Bacteroidetes phylum (Sato et al., 2010; de Diego et al., 2016).
PET27 and PET30 were active on PET foil, but diﬀered
strongly in their overall activities. PET27 contains a Phe-Met-Trp

The residues of IsPETase are indicated in black. PET30 and PET27 lack a disulﬁde bridge in the proximity of a catalytic loop.Supplementary Figure 4 provides the

such as LCC and IsPETase both carry a Tyr-Met-Trp consensus
binding motif while the non-active enzymes PET38, PET53,
PET57 PET58 and PET59 revealed either a Phe-Met-Ala,
a Phe-Met-Trp or a Trp-Met-Tyr substrate binding motif.
PET30 mutants, in which the amino acids were adjusted
according to the active PETases, did not show the expected
increase in activity. Therefore, we assume that not only
individual amino acids are decisive, but rather that an
interplay of hydrophobicity, location and accessibility of
the catalytic triad is crucial for whether polymers can be
degraded (Figure 4).
Benchmarking activities of polymer active enzymes with
literature values is not trivial since most studies use diﬀerent types
of foils with diﬀerent degrees of crystallinity and distinct assay
conditions. To partially overcome this challenge, we produced
our own recombinant wildtype enzymes of the IsPETase and
compared its activities with PET27 and PET30. As expected,
IsPETase was 4.7-fold more active at 30 ◦C than PET27 and
up to 253-fold more active than PET30. With respect to the
overall activity of the IsPETase, however, our data are in line with
published data for this enzyme (Son et al., 2019). The observation
here that the activities of the PET27 and PET30 enzymes are
relatively low compared to the IsPETase and certainly with

all other PETases included in the tree are indicated inSupplementary Table 3. The term “uncultured bacterium” refers to a not further speciﬁed microorganism

respect to the published values of the even more active LCC imply
that PET27 and PET30 are not PET esterases in sensu strictu.
However, our data imply that both are short-chain fatty acid
acting esterases revealing promiscuity in their substrate proﬁle
(Table 3 and Figure 3).
Intriguingly, the observation that both enzymes were
catalytically active on PET foil could imply a wider role in the
degradation of PET and especially PET nanoparticles. Because
of the signiﬁcant activities even at 4 ◦C, these enzymes may
in fact play a yet unknown role in long-term degradation of
PET microparticles in cold environments. This hypothesis is
supported by our observations that homologs of both enzymes
can be found on a global level covering a wide range of climate
zones (Figure 1) and that at least the cultivable K. jeonii is able to
attach to PET surfaces.
In summary, our biochemical results signiﬁcantly extend
the knowledge of PET-degrading enzymes and provide
promising candidates for biotechnological applications at
low temperatures. Furthermore, the data presented here will
help to advance our knowledge on the ecological role of the

Supplementary Figure 1 | Further biochemical characterization of PET27 and
PET30 using pNP-substrates. Cofactor requirements were tested for PET27 with
pNP-C8 at 40◦C and for PET30 with pNP-C6 at 30◦C (A). For PET30, all other
tests were carried out with pNP-C6 and all assays except (B) were conducted at
30◦C. Thermostability of PET30 was assessed at 50 and 60◦C over 3 h with
pNP-C6 (B). Inhibitors (C) and detergents (D) generally decrease the activity of
PET30, particularly with higher concentrations. Activity of PET30 and
PET301PorC were compared under the same conditions using pNP-C6 (E). Data
represent mean values of at least three independent measurements.
