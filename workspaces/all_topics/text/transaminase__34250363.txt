ABSTRACT: In the present study, we have identiﬁed anω-transaminase
(ω-TA) from Chloroﬂexi bacterium from the genome database by using
two ω-TA sequences (ATA117 Arrmut11 fromArthrobacter sp.KNK168
and amine transaminase fromAspergillus terreus NIH2624) as templates
in a BLASTP search and motif sequence alignment. The protein
sequence of theω-TA from C. bacterium (CbTA) shows 38% sequence
identity to that of ATA117 Arrmut11. The gene sequence ofCbTA was
inserted into pRSF-Duet1 and functionally expressed inEscherichia coli
BL21(DE3). The results showed that the recombinant CbTA has a
speciﬁc activity of 1.19 U/mg for (R)-α-methylbenzylamine [(R)-MBA]
at pH 8.5 and 45°C. The substrate acceptability test showed thatCbTA
has signiﬁcant reactivity to aromatic amino donors and amino receptors.
More importantly,CbTA also exhibited good aﬃnity toward some cyclic
substrates. The homology model ofCbTA was built by Discovery Studio,
and docking was performed to describe the relative activity toward some substrates.CbTA evolved by site-speciﬁc mutagenesis and
found that the Q192G mutant increased the activity to (R)-MBA by around 9.8-fold. The Q192G mutant was then used to convert
two cyclic ketones,N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone andN-Boc-3-piperidone, and both the conversions were obviously improved compared to
that of the parentalCbTA.
1. INTRODUCTION
Chiral amines are very important intermediates, which have a
wide range of applications in medicine and ﬁne chemical
industries.1 The production of chiral amines includes chemical
and biochemical methods. As far as chemical methods are
concerned, chiral amines are usually produced by the
asymmetric catalysis of prochiral molecules, such as hydro-
genation of imine or enamine, alkylation of imine, amino
hydroxylation, and reductive amination.
2 In order to overcome
the drawbacks of low enantioselectivity, need for noble-metal
catalysts, harsh reaction conditions, and environmental concerns
in asymmetric synthesis, several biochemical methods using
eﬃcient biocatalysts have been developed and managed to
replace chemical methods. These methods mainly involve
enzymes such as amine oxidases, ammonia lyases, amine
dehydrogenases, and transaminases.
3−5 Among them, ω-trans-
aminases (ω-TAs), which catalyze the transfer of ketone and
amino groups, have received extensive attention.6−9 The well-
known example of the synthesis of chiral amines byω-TAs is the
manufacturing of sitagliptin, an oral antihyperglycemic drug.10
Interestingly, ω-TAs originating from various sources have
shown distinct enantioselectivity, that is, (R)-selective or (S)-
selective. Hence, both enantiomers of speciﬁc amines can be
produced byω-TAs with diﬀerent enantioselectivities. Although
the ω-TA Ata-117 Arrmut11 fromArthrobacter sp. KNK168 is
commercially available now, only a few (R)-selective ω-TAs
have been identiﬁed.11,12 Therefore, the discovery of novelR-
selective ω-TAs has still been the focus issue in the past few
years. Bornscheuer et al.13,14 developed a method for predicting
and screening enzyme functions on the basis of a key motif in
sequence, which has been proved to be eﬀective and successfully
used to search and identify 17 (R)-selective ω-TAs by database
mining. The method has also been applied to discoverﬁve other
diﬀerent sources of (R)-selective ω-TAs.15 In recent years, more
and more ( R)-selective ω-TAs have been discerned and
investigated, but their wide applications are still limited by
their poor properties.16−18 In order to improve the performance
of enzymes, protein engineering has usually been adopted to
conduct enzyme design and optimization. An (R)-selective ω-
TA has been created by bioinformatic analysis combined with
the computational redesign of the
D-amino acid amino-
transferase, exhibiting a speciﬁc activity close to those of natural

(R)-selective ω-TAs.19 On the basis of a ﬂuorescence-based
screening system, a KnowVolution campaign has been carried
out to optimize a ( R)-selective ω-TA from Mycobacterium
vanbaalenii, and the best resulting mutant showed speci ﬁc
activity to acetonaphthone more than 100 times higher than that
of the parental enzyme.
20 In another study, a (R)-selective ω-TA
from Arthrobacter cumminsiiZJUT212 has been modiﬁed using
a semirational protein design, and a mutant has been screened to
produce the sitagliptin intermediate on a kilogram scale with
>99% e.e. and approximately 80% conversion.
21
In the current study, BLAST search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) was performed against an NCBI non-
redundant protein sequence library to identify a putativeω-
TA sequence fromChloroﬂexi bacterium(CbTA) using Ata-117
Arrmut11 from Arthrobacter sp. KNK168 and amine trans-
aminase from Aspergillus terreus NIH2624 as templates.
Subsequently, the gene ofCbTA was cloned intoEscherichia
coli for expression, and its kinetic parameters and substrate
spectra were characterized. Thereafter,CbTA was improved by
site-speciﬁc mutagenesis on the basis of the reported results and
modeling analysis.
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Sequence Analysis. Nowadays, more and more
protein sequences are stored in the database, which provides a
huge resource for the mining of biocatalysts. Ata-117 Arrmut11
from Arthrobacter sp.KNK168 (PDB ID: 5FR9), a variant of the
KNK168 with mutations in 27 p ositions with excellent
stereoselectivity, has been successfully applied to industrial
synthesis and a series of kinetic resolution.
10,22 The amine
transaminase fromA. terreus NIH2624 (PDB ID: 4CE5) is
another important template used to explore the functional motif
of (R)-selective ω-TAs and has been shown to be highly active.
14
Two independent BLAST searches were performed using two
crystallized ( R)-selective ω-TAs, Ata-117 Arrmut11 from
Arthrobacter sp. KNK168 and amine transaminase from A.
terreus NIH2624 as templates. Then, rational analysis of the
aligned sequences was performed using a motif sequence
alignment, following the criteria previously established by
Hö hne and Bornscheuer.
14Four putative sequences derived
from thermophilic bacteria were obtained from the NCBI
nonredundant protein sequence library: EAY57657.1 (Lepto-
spirillum rubarum), EES52356.1 (Leptospirillum ferrodiazotro-
phum), RIK47101.1 (Chloroﬂexi bacterium), and RLT41415.1
(Chloroﬂexi bacterium). The construction and expression of the
four enzymes are the same. According to the preliminary activity
test, the crude enzyme activities of these four enzymes were
0.207, 0.124, 0.91, and 0.248 U/mg, respectively. Among them,
CbTA, the ω-TA from C. bacterium (RIK47101.1) with the
highest activity, was selected as the target for further study.
CbTA showed identity with amine transaminases from the
following microorganisms: Arthrobacter sp. KNK16823 (PDB
ID: 3WWH; 38%), A. terreus NIH262424 (PDB ID: 4CE5;
36.1%) Aspergillus fumigatus Af29325 (GenBank accession no.
EAL86783; 37.2%),Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 430426 (PDB
ID: 5MQZ; 37.8%), Nectria haematococca MPVI27 (PDB:
4CMD; 36.8%),M. vanbaaleniiPYR-1 (GenBank accession no.
ABM15291; 35.9%), and Geoglobus acetivorans26 (PDB ID:
5E25; 35.8%). Although the identity with the reported sequence
is not high, the functional sites of R86, K188, and E221 are
conservative after alignment. Phylogenetic tree analysis is
performed to verify the taxonomic and evolutionary relationship
of CbTA to previously reported transaminases, and the results
are presented in Figure 1. Nine amino acid sequences with
diﬀerent degrees of sequence identity toCbTA were collected
and compared. CbTA was found to have a close evolutionary
relationship with thermophilic archaeaGeoglobus acetivorans.
2.2. Puriﬁcation and Identiﬁcation of the Recombi-
nant CbTA. The recombinantE. coliBL21(DE3)/pRSF-CbTA
cells were cultured, collected, and sonicated. The expressed
recombinant protein with a theoretical molecular weight of 44.3
kDa and was detectable in the soluble part ofE. coli BL21
(DE3)/pRSF-CbTA cells (Figure 2). The recombinant protein
is puriﬁed by immobilized metal ion aﬃnity chromatography
with the assistance of His-tag at theN-terminus of the sequence,
and the puriﬁcation results are shown inFigure 2. The followed
activity test indicated that the speciﬁc activity ofCbTA to (R)-α-
methylbenzylamine [(R)-MBA] was 1.19 U/mg at pH 8.5, 45
°C.

algorithm in the molecular evolutionary genetic analysis package (MEGA 7) and the relative positions of the proteins were highlighted and labeled with
species names.

2.3. Enzymatic Properties ofCbTA. As shown inFigure
3a, the eﬀect of pH onCbTA activity is assessed over the range of
pH 6.0 to 10.5, andCbTA has the highest activity at pH 8.5,
which is similar to the knownω-TAs.28,29 For example, a typical
(R)-selective ω-TA fromArthrobacter sp.KNK168 has shown an
optimal pH of 8.0 to 9.0.30 Besides, a branched-chain amino acid
aminotransferase TUZN1299 identiﬁed from the genome of the
hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermoproteus uzoniensis has
exhibited an optimal pH of 8.0.31 The inﬂuence of temperature
on CbTA activity was evaluated over a range of 25−65 °C, and
the highest activity was detected at 45°C( Figure 3b). Figure 3c
presents the temperature proﬁle ofCbTA, and results show that
it has good thermal stability. Interestingly, with the increase of
incubation time at 45°C, the highest activity ofCbTA can reach
twice of the original activity. The possible mechanisms for
stability are high bulk density, optimal charge pattern or ion pair,
and minimized hydrophobic surface area and helical stability.
32
This increase in activity is probably caused by temperature-
related folding that increases stabilizing interactions, thus
improving its reactivity; we also noticed a similar increase in
an thermophilic transaminase from Geobacillus thermodeliniﬁ-
cans.33 The temperature dependence also showed thatCbTA
retains 50% activity after 12 h of incubation at 50−55 °C, but it
was signiﬁcantly inactivated at above 60°C. Similarly, most of
the thermophilic TAs have shown signiﬁcant thermal stability at
about 55 °C.34 For instance, it has been found that a
transaminase identiﬁed fromThermomicrobium roseumretained

50% activity after 5 h of incubation at 70°C.35 A β-amino acid
transaminase Ms-TA2, which has been discovered in the
genome of theMeiothermus strain isolated in an Icelandic hot
spring, kept around 60% activity after incubation at 50°C for 3
h.
36 However, few thermophilic TAs remain active after
incubation at temperatures above 65 °C. A novel amine
transaminase has demonstrated spectacular thermostability,
and its activity can be maintained at 85% or around 40% after
being incubated at 80°C for 5 or 14 days.37
The organic cosolvent is very necessary to increase the
solubility of substrates. The inﬂuence of the organic cosolvent
on CbTA activity was determined by adding methanol, ethanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile in reaction
solutions (Figure 3d). Results showed that the activity of
CbTA increased signi ﬁcantly in all four 20 −40% organic
cosolvents, while it decreased in 60% organic cosolvents. This
indicates thatCbTA is well tolerable to the organic solvents and
the results are superior to that of a solvent-tolerant haloarchaeal

mine.38
2.4. Kinetic Parameters ofCbTA. The kinetic parameters
are helpful to evaluate the catalytic ability of enzymes. Given that
transaminases operate via a typical dual substrate recognition,
the K
m and kcat to either substrate ofCbTA were determined by
changing the concentration of (R)-MBA or pyruvate from 2.5 to
40 mM, respectively. With 20 mM pyruvate as a cosubstrate, the
K
m and kcat of CbTA to (R)-MBA are 14.68 mM and 3397.63 s−1,
while theKm and kcat of CbTA for pyruvate are 2.834 mM and
1617.5 s−1, respectively. Compared with the ATA117 from
Arthrobacter sp. KNK168, CbTA showed similar aﬃnity for
pyruvate, but itsKm value for (R)-MBA was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of ATA117, which indicated thatCbTA had a slightly
lower aﬃnity for amine. However,CbTA showed lowerKm to
pyruvate and higher kcat than a transaminase fromFusarium
oxysporum,39 which means higher reactivity on pyruvate (Figure
4).
2.5. Substrate Speciﬁcity ofCbTA. Previous studies on the
substrate range and stereoselectivity have shown that the active
center of transaminase is composed of two active pockets. The
large pocket can embrace the large group and the small pocket is
usually limited to methyl-sized substituents.
40 Considering the
binding of the substrate to theω-TA active center, we resolved
the structure of the substrate on the basis of theω-TA active site
model, and theω-TA’s large pocket embraces R1, while theω-
TA’s small pocket contains R2. All substrates were divided into
four groups as follows: aromatic and aliphatic amines, amino
acids, ketones, and aldehydes to allow us to compare reactivity
chemically.
As shown inTables 1−4, we canﬁnd thatCbTA can utilize a
wide range of amino donors and acceptors for the substrate
range, which is consistent with the literature
41, indicating their
potential for synthetic applications. It can be seen fromTable 1
that CbTA has good activity for most aliphatic and aromatic
amines, but there is a marked diﬀerence among the various
aliphatic or aromatic amines, which is similar to the results
reported by Jiang et al.
15 A comparison of the relative activity of
CbTA to aliphatic amines revealed that it showed a higher
activity for the long-chain amines (A5−A8), while it exhibited a
very low reactivity against the short-chain amines, isopropyl-
amine (A3) and 2-butylamine (A4), except for propylamine
(A2). Interestingly, CbTA displayed higher reactivity to
propylamine but extremely low to isopropylamine unlike other
amine transaminases. Furthermore,CbTA is quite reactive to
cyclic amines, and its relative activity is normally better with the
increase of the ring (A9−A13). Unexpectedly, when amino acids
are used as the amino donors (B1−B4), the activity given by
CbTA is not very high, or even very low, for example, 2-
aminobutyric acid (B5).
The amino receptor speciﬁcity of CbTA is studied and the
results are presented inTables 3and 4. CbTA appears to have
similar amino receptor speciﬁcity for Capronia semiimmersa.
42
The amino receptor spectrum shows that CbTA has low
reactivity to nearly all aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones
except for 2′-nitroacetophenone (C7), 4′-methoxyacetophe-
none (C8), benzaldehyde (D5), and 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde
(D6). According to the results given in tables, amino acceptors
with an aryl group have comparatively good reactivity forCbTA,
and aryl ketones and aromatic aldehydes present similar results.
However, low activity forCbTA is observed in the case where
the selected aliphatic ketones or aldehydes were used as amino
acceptors. In comparison, the reactivity of CbTA toward
aliphatic ketones and aldehydes was diﬀerent from previously
reported results.
43 It should be noted that in most cases benzene
ring with methyl substituent group in aryl ketones would
dramatically inhibit the reactivity of amino acceptors, and the
existence of methylene between aryl group and aldehyde group
also signiﬁcantly reduced the activity ofCbTA to aryl aldehydes.
Additionally, CbTA appears to be reactive to two selected cyclic
substrates with ketone groups.
Discovery studio proposed an active site model of CbTA
binding to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). The most favorable
binding model contains several reported key residues. Previous
study has reported that residue K252 shows signiﬁcant catalytic
reactivity with coenzymes and substrates.
44 As is shown in
Figure 5, K252, which binds to the center of the pocket, has a
strong hydrogen bond force and attractive charge with PLP. At
the same time, a strong hydrogen bond force was also found
between PLP and residues G288 and S346. Residue E285 is
located in the substrate-cofactor binding pocket and has a
conventional hydrogen bonding with the amino group of (R)-
MBA. In addition, it is observed that the force contribution of
the oxygen atom of the phosphate group in PLP was provided by
K252, G288, and E285, which is similar to other (R)-selective
transaminase.
45
To manage to explain the possible cause of substrate
speciﬁcity, some selected amino donors and acceptors were
docked withCbTA and PLP, and the results were visualized by
Discovery Studio (Figure 6and Figure 7). The most favorable
docking conﬁguration was selected to analyze the forces. As is
shown inFigure 6, from the docking results of aliphatic amines
(A2−A8), residues in binding sphere ofCbTA might have Pi−
alkyl and attractive charge on the carbon chain, except
isopropylamine (A3), which explains the low reactivity for A3.
According to the docking results of cyclic amines, PLP has
strong acting forces, such as Pi −cation interaction and
conventional hydrogen bond, on the amino groups of cyclic
substrates cyclobutanamine ( A10) and cyclopentylamine
(A11), while the acting force on amino groups of cyclopropyl-
amine (A9) is only the C−H bond. It seems that with the
increase of the size of the cyclic substrate, the L-pocket becomes
more suitable for binding ligands. When aromatic substrates
were involved, there were many intermolecular forces between
residues in binding sphere and benzene ring, including T-shaped
Pi−Pi stack and Pi −alkyl interactions. Taking ( R)-1-(3-
chlorophenyl) ethylamine (A17) as an example, we could see
that residues R287 and Q259 have a strong conventional
hydrogen bond with the amino group of A17 and that the chloro
group in benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group forming
aP i−alkyl force with residue H260, which may lead to high

reactivity of A17. In addition, the low activity of benzylamine
(A14) is probably because of the fact that coenzyme PLP has no
interaction with it, and residue E259 also has an unfavorable
donor−donor to its amino group.
The docking results of selected amino acceptors with the
active site model ofCbTA binding to PLP are shown inFigure 7.
We could observe that pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) has a
strong hydrogen bond with the aldehyde group in the typical
acceptor pyruvate (C1), and residues T242, N253, and H258
also bear the corresponding hydrogen bond with the aldehyde
group and carboxyl group; we infer that this leads to strong
aﬃnity for pyruvic acid. As for α-ketoglutarate (C6), the
interaction between PMP and the substrate was not found,
which may be the reason whyCbTA has no activity on C6. From
the possible docking diagrams of ketones, it could be perceived
that the active site of PMP and the enzyme tended to bind to
stable structures containing benzene or rings and only exhibited
weak van der Waals for straight chain substrates, which might be
the reason why most of the aliphatic ketones were low or even
inactive, for example, pentanone (C3). For the docking results of
aromatic ketones, the electron-withdrawing groups of 2 ′-

nitroacetophenone (C7) with good reactivity show the
attractive charge and salt bridge with PMP. In the case of 4′-
methoxyacetophenone (C8), PMP has a Pi−alkyl interaction
with its benzene ring and other residues have a Pi−Pi T-shaped
interaction and hydrogen bond with the benzene ring and
ketone groups, with its methoxy group having an additional C−
H interaction binding withCbTA. In contrast to other acceptors,
the substituted R2 groups show little interaction withCbTA and
PMP, suggesting that the small pocket ofCbTA is not suitable
for substrates with R2 more than one methyl group, which may
be responsible for the lack of activity of 2-hydroxyacetophenone
(C13) and valerophenone (C14). For aldehydes, residues in
both PMP and binding sphere have a conventional hydrogen
bond with the aldehyde group except for propionaldehyde (D1)
and 2-ethylhexanal (D4), which might explain the low
reactivities of D1 and D4. With regard to the most reactive
amino acceptors benzaldehyde (D5) and 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde
(D6), it is found during the docking that residue G259 appears
to exert a strong force on the D5 and D6 aldehyde groups, which
is not available for other aldehydes during the docking. Besides,

the nitro group of D6 appears to have an additional force on the
active site as an electron-withdrawing group.
2.6. Site-Speciﬁc Mutagenesis ofCbTA. The enzymatic
transamination of ketones to amines is an important method to
obtain various chiral building blocks or pharmaceuticals. In this
study, a new ω-TA, CbTA, was obtained and its enzymatic
properties and substrate spectrum were determined, showing
the potential ofCbTA for the production of chiral amines and
unnatural amino acids. However, the unsatisfactory activity of
CbTA on many ketones is a vital obstacle for its application in
chiral amine production. In order to improve its activity, site-
saturation mutagenesis was conducted on the basis of the
previous results and homology modeling.
As conﬁrmed by Voss et al., residues F130, Y190, Q190,
G288, and A348 showed signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the activity of
amine transaminase. The docking result ofCbTA with PLP and
(R)-MBA indicated that residues K252, E285, G288, Q192, and
Y190 are all located in the small pocket of the active site. Hereby,
residues Y190, Q192, and G288 are selected for site-speciﬁc
mutagenesis, and the results are presented inFigure 8. The
results showed that the changes in residues Y190 and Q192 did
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the activity ofCbTA to (R)-MBA.
Among them, mutant Q192G was the most beneﬁcial mutation.
The activity of the mutant Q192G is 9.8 times than that of the
parental enzyme. However, there was no signiﬁcant change in
the activity of mutants G288 forCbTA.

Chiral N-heterocyclic molecules, especially compounds with
amino groups, such as 3-aminopiperidines, are valuable
intermediates in the production of biologically active com-
pounds with pharmacological properties.
46 Subsequently, CbTA
and mutant Q192G are further applied to evaluate the
conversion of cyclic substrates with a ketone group, and the
results are shown in Figure 9. After 36 h of reaction, the
conversion of N-Boc-pyrrolidinone and N-Boc-piperidone by
CbTA was about 15% and 12%, and the conversion ofN-Boc-
pyrrolidinone and N-Boc-piperidone by mutant Q192G was
increased to 23% and 30%, respectively. Compared with the
parental CbTA, the reactivity of the mutant Q192G to cyclic
substrates was obviously improved.
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1. Reagents. All the chemicals used were of analytical
grade and purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical
Technology Co. Ltd. or Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. unless otherwise
noted.
3.2. Sequence Analysis.The Ata-117 Arrmut11 sequences
from Arthrobacter sp.KNK168 and amine transaminase fromA.
terreus NIH2624 were used as templates for BLAST search in
NCBI toﬁnd newω-TA sequences. After removing incomplete
and redundant sequences, MEGA 7.0 was used to align all the
unknown sequences in the identity range of 20−60% toward the
templates, and the target sequences that conform to the
functional characterstics of (R)-selective ω-TA with conserved
sites R86, K188, and E221 were screened out according to the
motif sequence [31 H/R****Y*V/*S(T/A/H/P), 95 F(Y)-
VE(ANQ)] as conﬁrmed in ref14. Among them, a putative (R)-
selective ω-TA from C. bacterium (CbTA) was chosen for
further study, which shows 38% identity with Ata-117 Arrmut11.
A phylogenetic tree was also generated with MEGA 7.0 by using
the neighbor-joining algorithm.

3.3. Plasmid and Strain Construction. The gene
sequence of the putativeCbTA was further codon-optimized
and synthesized by GenScript (Nanjing, China). The encoding
region was inserted between the BamH I and Xho I, with a 6-
histidine tag at theN-terminal, resulting in plasmid pRSF-CbTA.
The recombinant plasmi d was transformed into E. coli
BL21(DE3) to generate the recombinant strain of E. coli
BL21(DE3)/pRSF-CbTA.
3.4. Expression and Puri ﬁcation of Recombinant
CbTA. Recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)/pRSF-CbTA was
cultured in 100 mL of LB medium (1.0% peptone, 0.5% yeast
extract, and 1.0% NaCl) with kanamycin (50μg/mL) at 37°C
and 200 rpm. When the OD600 of the culture reaches about 0.6,
0.02 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was
added, and the culture was cultivated at 20°C for another 24 h.
Thereafter, the cells were harvested, re-suspended in 20 mL of
glycine−NaOH buﬀer (50 mM, pH 8.5), and sonicated in an ice
bath for 30 min. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation
at 8000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was passed
through a 5 mL Ni-NTA column to purify recombinantCbTA,
and then the puriﬁed CbTA solution was stored at 4°C for
further experiments. The molecular weight of the puriﬁed CbTA
was determined by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. 49 Ac o n t r o l
experiment was performed under the same conditions using
an E. colitransformant carrying empty pRSFDuet-1.
3.5. Characterization of Biochemical Properties. By
using the following buﬀers with diﬀerent pH values of 6.0−10.5,
50 mM phosphate buﬀer, pH 6.0−8.0, and 50 mM glycine−
NaOH buﬀer, pH 8.5−10.5, the optimal pH of CbTA was
determined at 40°C. The optimal temperature forCbTA was
investigated from 25 to 65°C at pH 8.5. Relative activity (%)
was calculated using the maximal activity as a control (100%).
The temperature stability was measured by incubatingCbTA for
a period in the temperature range of 40−65 °C.
The tolerance ofCbTA to organic solvents is determined by
incubating 100μLo fCbTA in glycine−NaOH buﬀer (50 mM,
pH 8.5) for 5 h at room temperature. The buﬀer contains 0, 5,
10, 20, 40, 60, and 80% (v/v) organic cosolvents (acetonitrile or
DMSO or methanol or ethanol). After that, residual activities
were evaluated using the assay method of enzyme activity
described below.
3.6. Assay of Enzyme Activity.Enzyme activity analysis
was performed in 500μL of glycine−NaOH buﬀer (50 mM, pH
8.5) containing PLP (20μM), (R)-MBA (10 mM), and sodium
pyruvate (10 mM). The reaction started at 45°C by adding 0.05
mg of the puriﬁed CbTA to the mixture. After 30 min, the
mixture was heated and boiled for 20 min to stop the reaction.
All the experiments were performed in triplicate. The resulting
acetophenone was analyzed by high-performance liquid

chromatography (HPLC). One unit of enzyme activity was
deﬁned as the production of 1μmol acetophenone per minute.
3.7. Determination of Kinetic Parameters.The kinetic
parameters ofCbTA to (R)-MBA or pyruvate were measured at
45 °C and pH 8.5. According to the method described above, the
initial reaction rate was determined under the conditions of
diﬀerent concentrations of ( R)-MBA or pyruvate. The
production of acetophenone and the consumption of pyruvate
were analyzed by HPLC. In order to determine the kinetic
parameters ofCbTA to (R)-MBA, the reaction solution was 500
μL of glycine−NaOH buﬀer (50 mM, pH 8.5) containing 20
mM pyruvate, 0.05 mg ofCbTA, 0.02 mM PLP, and diﬀerent
concentrations of (R)-MBA. The kinetic parameters ofCbTA to
pyruvate was measured in 500μL of glycine−NaOH buﬀer (50
mM, pH 8.5) containing 20 mM (R)-MBA, 0.05 mg ofCbTA,
0.02 mM PLP, and diﬀerent concentrations of sodium pyruvate.
The K
m and kcat values of (R)-MBA and pyruvate were calculated
according to the nonlinear regressionﬁtting of the Michaelis−
Menten equation.
3.8. Characterization of the Substrate Speciﬁcity of
CbTA. Substrate speciﬁcity of CbTA was tested by reactions
between diﬀerent groups of amino donors and amino receptors.
All the experiments were performed in triplicate. When the
speciﬁcity of amino donors is studied, amino donors used are
listed in Tables 1, 2. The activity assay for each reaction was
carried out in a 50 mM glycine −NaOH buﬀer (pH 8.5)
containing 25 mM amino donor, 25 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.02
mM PLP, and a suitable amount of puriﬁed CbTA, with aﬁnal
volume of 500μLa t4 0°C for 30 min. The activity ofCbTA
against diﬀerent amino receptors was compared by measuring
the amount of acetophenone produced. When the speciﬁcity of
amino receptors is studied, amino receptors used are listed in
Tables 3, 4. The activity assay for each reaction was carried out in
a 50 mM glycine−NaOH buﬀer (pH 8.5) containing 25 mM
(R)-MBA, 25 mM amino receptor, 0.02 mM PLP, and a suitable
amount of puriﬁed CbTA, with aﬁnal volume of 500μLa t4 0°C
for 30 min. The activity ofCbTA against diﬀerent amino donors
was compared by measuring the reduction in pyruvate.
3.9. Molecular Modeling and Substrate Docking.
Molecular modeling was performed using Modeller 9.24 and
I-Tasser ( https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-Tasser/ ).
The homology model was based on the crystal structure
(PDB: 3WWH,
23 4CE5,24 4CMD,27 4UUG,25 and 5E2526), and
the best model was selected by Ramachandran analysis.
3.10. Site-Speciﬁc Mutagenesis.The amino acid residues
Y190, Q192, and G288 were selected for site-speciﬁc muta-
genesis on the basis of the previous results and modeling
analysis.
19 The site-speciﬁc mutagenesis was designed by a NDT
codon design. All primers are listed inTable 5. Site-speciﬁc
mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions of a
site-directed mutagenesis kit (MutExpress II Fast Mutagenesis
Kit V2, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Mutations were introduced by
the mutagenesis polymerase chain reaction. The ampli ﬁed
fragments were digested with DpnI at 37°C for 1 h, and the
recombinant plasmid was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3)
for screening. Individual colonies of the transformants were
transferred to 96-well plates containing 300μL of LB medium
with kanamycin (50 μg/mL), 96-well plates were incubated
overnight (37°C, 200 rpm). Subsequently, 30μL of that culture
suspension was transferred to a medium containing 300μLo f
fresh LB in each well for culture for 2 h (37°C, 200 rpm), and
then 300μL of LB containing 0.04 mM IPTG was added and
induced at 20 °C for 24 h and the sludge was collected by
centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 20 min. The cells were
fragmented according to a fragmentation kit (xTractor Buﬀer
Kit, TAKARA, Japan). After the cells were allowed to stand at
room temperature for 30 min, the crude mutantCbTA solution
was collected by centrifugation. Thereafter, the activity of the
mutants was tested as described above.
3.11. HPLC Analysis.The acetophenone was measured at
254 nm by HPLC (Agilent 1260) using an Agilent C18 column
(250 mm × 4.6 mm) at 30°C.
41 The mobile phase is water/
acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) and theﬂow rate is 1 mL/min.
The pyruvate was measured at 210 nm by HPLC (Agilent
1260) using an Agilent C18 column (250 mm× 4.6 mm) at 30
°C. The mobile phase is methyl alcohol/water/phosphoric acid
(20:80:0.03, v/v) and theﬂow rate is 0.8 mL/min.
The chiral MBA were detected by HPLC (Agilent 1260) with
a CR-I(+) chiral column (150 mm× 3.0 mm) (Daicel Corp.) at
254 nm and 30°C. The eluent is water/acetonitrile (70:30, v/v)
containing 0.36% triﬂuoroacetic acid at aﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/
min.
The analyses ofN-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone, N-Boc-3-piperidone,
N-Boc-3-aminopyrrolidine, andN-Boc-3-aminopiperidine were
performed on a HPLC system (Agilent 1260) with an Agilent
C18 column (250 mm× 4.6 mm) at 220 nm and 25°C. Elution
was carried out with a mobile phase of water/acetonitrile/
diethanolamine (70:30:0.1, v/v/v) at a rate of 1 mL/min.

4. CONCLUSIONS
(R)-selective ω-TAs has great potential for industrial
applications. In this work,CbTA, a hypothetical (R)-selective
ω-TA from C. bacterium was found by the motif sequence
BLAST from genome mining. On the basis of the amino acid
sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to verify the
taxonomic and evolutionary relationships ofCbTA with other
amine transaminase family homologues. Nine amino acid
sequences with diﬀerent degrees of sequence identity toCbTA
were selected and analyzed, and CbTA showed a close
evolutionary relationship to pyruvate transferase from M.
vanbaalenii PYR-1 and Ata-117 Arrmut11. By characterizing
the enzymatic properties ofCbTA, results showed thatCbTA
has good thermal stability, organic solvent tolerance, and broad
substrate speciﬁcity. Thereafter, the site-speciﬁc mutagenesis of
CbTA was conducted and the mutant Q192G with higher
activity was screened, which was applied in conversions ofN-
Boc-pyrrolidinone and N-Boc-piperidone. The results showed
that CbTA can be used as a valuable catalyst for the asymmetric
synthesis of chiral amines from the corresponding aldehydes or
ketones.
