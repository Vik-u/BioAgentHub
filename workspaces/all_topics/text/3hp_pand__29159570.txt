Abstract A biosustainable production route for 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), an
important platform chemical, would allow 3HP to be produced without using fossil
fuels. We are interested in investigating a potential biochemical route to 3HP from
pyruvate through β-alanine and, in this paper, we develop and solve a mathematical
model for the reaction kinetics of the metabolites involved in this pathway. We consider
two limiting cases, one where the levels of pyruvate are never replenished, the other
where the levels of pyruvate are continuously replenished and thus kept constant. We
exploit the natural separation of both the time scales and the metabolite concentrations
to make signiﬁcant asymptotic progress in understanding the system without resorting
to computationally expensive parameter sweeps. Using our asymptotic results, we are
able to predict the most important reactions to maximize the production of 3HP in
this system while reducing the maximum amount of the toxic intermediate compound
malonic semi-aldehyde present at any one time, and thus we are able to recommend
which enzymes experimentalists should focus on manipulating.

1 Introduction
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) can be used to produce many other valuable chemicals,
such as acrylic acid, 1,3-propanediol, and biodegradable polyesters ( Werpy et al. 2004;
Jiang et al. 2009 ). 3HP can be derived from biological sources and, as current industrial
methods to produce acrylic acid involve fossil fuels, a production route through 3HP
provides a biosustainable alternative. Although an in vivo production line in a bacterial
or fungal host is the eventual industrial target for 3HP , performing in vitro experiments
is an important prior step. The controlled nature of in vitro experiments allows for
more systematic deductions to be made, and hence in vitro experiments can highlight
potential roadblocks that may be more difﬁcult to analyse in a complex in vivo system.
Mathematical modelling allows for further systematic progress to be made, and can
reduce the experimental parameter space that needs to be searched.
In Kumar et al. (2013), three thermodynamically feasible pathways from pyruvate
to 3HP are suggested. We are interested here in mathematically modelling the route
through aspartate and β-alanine; this is the synthetic pathway successfully introduced
to Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Borodina et al. (2015). Thus, we consider the reactions

and we show a schematic representation of this pathway in Fig. 1.
Here, we do not consider enzyme mechanics for the ﬁrst two reactions in ( 1). This
is because pyruvate and oxaloacetate are required for the citric acid cycle, and we are
not interested in altering any enzymatic processes that may signiﬁcantly change this
important metabolic cycle. Thus, the enzyme kinetics for the latter four reactions are
the most appropriate targets for enhancement, and we therefore include these.
We note that ( 1e), the reaction between l-alanine and pyruvate, is not necessary
for a connected pathway between pyruvate and 3HP. However, as ( 1e) recycles l-
alanine and α-ketoglutarate (AKG) back into pyruvate and glutamic acid (GLU), used
in ( 1a) and ( 1b), respectively, the inclusion of ( 1e) may enhance the efﬁciency of the

direction of the reactions. The dashed lines denote reactions which additionally require GLU ( [R1])a n d
produce AKG ( [R2]), and the dotted lines denote reactions which additionally require AKG and produce

pathway. In Borodina et al. (2015), it was hypothesized that ( 1e) may have an effect on
the overall 3HP production, and we investigate this hypothesis here. More generally,
we are interested in determining which of the reactions are the most important for
3HP production. Additionally, malonic semialdehyde is a toxic compound, and so
we will also look for ways to reduce the amount of malonic semialdehyde present
in the system. To summarize, the general goal of this system, so far as possible, is
to maximize the 3HP produced whilst minimizing the maximum level of malonic
semialdehyde present in the system.
We will assume that there are enough molecules of each metabolite to use the law
of mass action and that the entire system is well-mixed and thus spatially independent.
Moreover, in any given reaction, we neglect any inhibitory effects from metabolites
not involved in the reaction and from any products of the reaction. We do so to limit the
number of parameters in the model, and to enable us to make analytic progress, thus
allowing us to develop physical insight into the system. Additionally, the production
levels of pyruvate within the system will vary in time. We consider two limiting cases,
pyruvate being a ﬁnite resource which is never replenished in the ﬁrst, but an inﬁnite
resource held at a constant concentration in the second. Whilst the actual levels of
pyruvate will, in practice, fall somewhere between these two cases, it is useful to
analyse both in detail: exploring and comparing these two extreme cases will provide
insight into the general pathway kinetics in intermediate cases.
As there are many parameters involved in this problem, a fully experimental
approach would be very time consuming. For the same reason, investigating its math-
ematical model using a purely numerical approach would also be a protracted process,
albeit shorter than the fully experimental one. We perform an asymptotic analysis (see,
for example, Kevorkian and Cole 2013 ; Hinch 1991 ; O’Malley Jr (2012)) to investi-
gate our model, thus enhancing our physical insight into the underlying system and
123

enabling us to determine how the concentrations vary as functions of the experimental
parameters. Due to this approach, exact knowledge of each kinetic parameter is not
required, just an estimate of the order of magnitude of each parameter.
We introduce a mathematical model to describe the nonlinear reaction kinetics in
§2. We solve this for non-replenished and continuously replenished pyruvate in § 3 and
§4, respectively, where we give both numerical and asymptotic solutions to describe
the system behaviour. We also consider the problem of general pyruvate production
in “Appendix C”, where we derive asymptotic solutions in one time regime for the
metabolite concentrations at leading order in terms of the pyruvate in the system. We
ﬁnish by discussing our results and comparing the two regimes in § 5,w h e r ew ea l s o
suggest future avenues of inquiry that follow from this work.

All the variables introduced here are deﬁned in Table 1, and the units and typical values
for each kinetic parameter are given in Table 2. We model a scenario where each of
the enzymes are introduced to a solution containing only pyruvate and glutamic acid,
and this resulting mixture is instantaneously well-mixed. We assume that the initial
concentration of pyruvate is [S
1](0) = S0, where S0 is around 1 mM. We will state
the remaining initial conditions after discussing how we deal with uncertainty in the
kinetic parameters.
W es e ei nT a b l e2 that estimates for the kinetic parameters can vary over three orders
of magnitude between different organisms. To investigate how the system behaves as
these parameters vary we ﬁrst form dimensionless variables, scaling each dimensional
metabolite concentration with S
0 and time with 1 /k1 (the characteristic time of the
ﬁrst reaction between pyruvate and oxaloacetate). Moreover, we form dimensionless
123

parameters by scaling the kinetic parameters with k1 and the appropriate power of
S0. We then introduce the artiﬁcial small dimensionless parameter ε = 10−2, and
allow each dimensionless system parameter to be written as cεj where c is an O(1)
parameter (between 0 .1 and 10), and j is an integer. The dimensionless parameters in
our system are given in the lower half of Table 2. This approach allows us to interrogate
the system using an asymptotic analysis. Although (as always) there may theoretically
be an issue with this method in equating terms with the same powers of ε when large
(or small) O(1) parameters are multiplied together, we will show that our asymptotic

In general, it is only ratios of kinetic parameters that are known for a given reaction, as substrate binding
to an enzyme is too quick to accurately measure the reaction rate. We therefore choose parameter values
(using the ratios given in the references) that lead to the enzyme complexes being formed over a time
period that is much shorter than the time period over which the metabolite concentrations change. This,
experimental uncertainty, and differences in enzymes in different organisms lead to a large possible range
for the parameter values. In scaling the kinetic parameters with S0 and powers of ε, we have used the values
S0 = 1mM, ε = 10−2. The values of k1 and k2 are chosen to be effective reaction rates as we are not
interested in modifying native enzymes. Thus, k1 is the ratio of the PYC turnover number to the Michaelis
constant for pyruvate multiplied by an estimated concentration of PYC, chosen to be around 1 µM. k2
is the ratio of the AAT turnover number to the product of the Michaelis constants for oxaloacetate and
GLU, multiplied by an estimated concentration of AAT, chosen to be around 0 .1 µM. The references are:

and numerical results show excellent agreement, and thus the approach is reliable for
this system.
For the initial conditions, we assume that the initial levels of pyruvate and of glu-
tamic acid are of comparable size and, to mimic the environment within a cell, that
these concentrations are much larger than the initial concentrations of each enzyme.
Additionally, we assume that the initial concentrations of each enzyme are of com-
parable size. Although enzyme-to-substrate levels will vary, a reasonable assumption
is that this ratio is around 1:100 and thus of O(ε) for our problem ( Albe et al. 1990 ).
Thus, recalling that [S
1](0) = S0,w ea l s oh a v e [R1](0) = αS0, [E1](0) = εa1 S0,
[E2](0) = εa2 S0, [E3](0) = εa3 S0, and [E4](0) = εa4 S0, noting that the remain-
ing metabolite concentrations start at zero. The dimensionless parameters α, a1, a2,
a3, and a4 are of O(1). These conditions will allow us to investigate how the system
changes as the initial conditions of the system vary when we perform our asymptotic
analysis. From the initial conditions and ( 2i–2p), we can immediately deduce that
[Ei ]+[ Ci ]=[ Ei ](0), (3)
where i = 1,2,3,4.
As we now have our dimensionless variables in terms of powers of ε, we can
scale each concentration variable with the appropriate power of ε to obtain the correct
leading-order system for t = O(1). This will allow us to immediately perform an
asymptotic analysis for small ε. We give the correct scalings for these variables in
Table 1, obtained by considering a dominant balance for each equation in the system
and the non-zero initial conditions discussed above. We will perform a similar proce-
dure to determine the correct asymptotic scalings over longer timescales, for which
we will use effective ‘initial’ conditions obtained by asymptotic matching between

timescales. The dimensionless form of ( 3) yields the relationships E1 = 1 − εC1,
E2 = 1 − ε3C2, E3 = 1 − ε4C3, and E4 = 1 − ε2C4. Replacing each instance of
Ei (for i ∈{ 1,2,3,4}) with the appropriate function of Ci allows us to reduce the
dimension of the system of ODEs, accounting for ( 2i–2l). The remaining dimension-

to the reference simulation where ai = 1f o r i = 1, 2, 3,4

3.1 Numerical results
We solve the system ( 4) numerically, using ode15s in MATLAB. Our asymptotic
solutions will reveal that the system is stiff, and our choice of numerical approach
reﬂects this. We use the parameter values given in Table 2, and see that there are
two important timescales, where t = O(1) and t = O(1/ε) (recalling that ε = 10−2),
respectively (Fig. 2). Over each of these timescales, the levels of malonic semialdehyde
rise then fall, and the levels of 3HP rise to a plateau. Additionally, the levels of malonic
semialdehyde and 3HP can vary signiﬁcantly when the initial concentration of different
enzymes is increased (over-expression). We model the effect of over-expressing a
particular enzyme by starting the simulation with twice the levels of that enzyme
compared to the black reference line in Fig. 2. We emphasize that the parameter
values we give are not likely to be exact but, as we will later derive solutions to our
system as functions of these parameters, we will be able to determine which reactions
are the most important to the system by analyzing the form of these solutions without
knowledge of the exact values that these parameters take.
We now discuss how the over-expression of a given enzyme affects the system. A
schematic for the metabolic network is given in Fig. 1. Increasing the levels of PAND
has a positive but small effect on the levels of both malonic semialdehyde and 3HP .
Over-expressing BAPAT has a much larger effect, signiﬁcantly increasing the levels of
both malonic semialdehyde and 3HP . In contrast, we see that over-expressing HPDH
does not appear to have any effect on the levels of 3HP and, in fact, signiﬁcantly
decreases the maximum amount of malonic semialdehyde in the system. Finally, we
see that over-expressing ALT has a very small negative effect on the levels of malonic
semialdehyde, and a signiﬁcant positive effect on the levels of 3HP .

In the next section, we explore the system ( 4) using an asymptotic analysis. This will
allow us to determine how the system depends on the dimensionless parameters, and
thus to explore the experimental parameter space without resorting to computationally
expensive parameter sweeps.
3.2 Asymptotic structure
We now investigate the system ( 4) by exploiting the small parameter, ε, using an
asymptotic analysis. There are two main asymptotic regions of interest in time, where
t = O(1) and t = O(1/ε), which we refer to as medium and long time, respectively
(Fig. 2).
When t = O(1), the system is governed by the release of pyruvate and GLU
through the main pathway to 3HP and towards the production of l-alanine. When
t = O(1/ε), the levels of pyruvate have diminished, and the system is governed
by the degradation of oxaloacetate with GLU into aspartate and AKG. Additionally,
the l-alanine produced when t = O(1) is now converted back into pyruvate which,
although only a small amount, is enough to have a leading-order effect on the reaction
with β-alanine, and thus a leading-order effect on the amount of 3HP produced. Thus,
the l-alanine acts as a store of pyruvate over t = O(1), and this is released over
t = O(1/ε). In the next section, we solve the leading-order versions of the system ( 4)
in each of these asymptotic regions.
3.3 Asymptotic solutions
The early-time behaviour of the system is given in “Appendix A”, obtained by Tay-

+. The more interesting behaviour for
malonic semialdehyde and 3HP production occurs for medium and long time, and we
now consider the system dynamics over these timescales in turn.

γ4 = α¯k−8/(¯k−7 + ¯k8), λ= α¯k2 ¯k5 ¯k6/¯k−5,ω = ¯k3 ¯k4/¯k−3. (8)
From Table 2, we see that the parameter ω = ¯k3 ¯k4/¯k−3 is associated with ( 1c), the
reaction from aspartate to β-alanine. That is, ω is proportional to both the ratio of the
forward to backward reaction rate constants in ( 1c) and to the initial concentration of
PAND, the enzyme that controls ( 1c). Thus, from the prevalence of ω in the solution
(7), we see that ( 1c) affects the timing of the system when t = O(1), and the other
reactions control the concentration levels of the metabolites. For later analysis, we
additionally note that the parameter grouping ¯k5 ¯k6/¯k−5 is associated with ( 1d), the
reaction from β-alanine and pyruvate to l-alanine and malonic semialdehyde.
We note there is an implicit assumption that ω ̸= 1 in writing ( 7), but the apparent
singularities are removable in this limit and, as such, they do not change the nature of
the solutions. We see that these solutions are excellent approximations to the numerical
solutions (dashed lines in Fig. 3).
Whilst the solutions ( 7) do satisfy the given initial conditions, several were not
formally imposed in the solution derivation. This is because the system ( 4) is singular

Fig. 3 The numerical and asymptotic solutions for the metabolite concentrations in the non-replenished
pyruvate case. The solid light lines denote the numerical solutions, and the broken darker lines denote the
asymptotic solutions. Dashed lines represent the t = O(1) solutions given in ( 7), dash-dotted lines represent
the early-time solutions given in “Appendix A”, and dotted lines represent the late time solutions given in
(11, B2), and ( B4). We use parameter values α = 0.5, a
1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 1, and a4 = 1. We have split
the metabolite concentrations into a the substrates that tend to a non-zero constant value for large time,
b the substrates which tend to zero for large time, c the enzyme complexes, and d the product. We plot
([Si ], [Ri ],[Ci ],[P])/S0
as ε → 0. Although we could formally match the solution ( 7) with an early-time
solution, it is not useful for our eventual goal of determining 3HP production. Instead,
we show that there are further early-time regions by Taylor expanding the initial
conditions as t → 0+ in “Appendix A”. We see that these early-time solutions are
excellent approximations to the numerical solutions (dash-dotted lines in Fig. 3).
3.3.2 Late time: t = O(1/ε)
The more interesting behaviour occurs for longer time. The solutions for S4 and R2,
given in ( 7d) and ( 7h), respectively, appear to be unbounded. As we start with a
ﬁnite level of nonreplenishable pyruvate, this is unphysical and suggests that there are
further dynamics at play. We can obtain the correct scaling by looking for a change in
leading-order terms in the system ( 4), which occurs when t = O(1/ε). To investigate
this, we introduce t = T /ε, where T = O(1), and we make the asymptotic scalings
(S4, R2) = ε−1(S4, R2), (S6,C2,C3,C4) = ε(S6,C 2,C3,C4), and S1 = ε2 S1.T h e

where Ω = ¯k7 ¯k8/(¯k2(¯k−7 + ¯k8)), which is proportional to the initial concentration of

between l-alanine and pyruvate, and terms that are raised to the power of Ω arise due
to this reaction. In contrast, the terms not raised to the power of Ω in the integrand of
(11m) arise due to the conversion of pyruvate into β-alanine.

To match the long-term solutions ( 11) with the t = O(1) solutions ( 7), we would
have to consider intermediate matching regions where exponentially decreasing terms
balance algebraically growing terms. These regions occur between t = O(1) and
t = O(1/ε), and thus generally involve a translation in time of some multiple of
log(1/ε). As these regions are uninteresting—the decreasing and increasing terms
pass by each other without interacting—we omit further discussion of these regions.
The long-time dynamics described by ( 11) are sensitive to the sign of α − 1, with
the singularities as α → 1 being removable. Moreover, the steady states in ( 11)a s
T →∞ depend on the sign of α − 1, and thus are sensitive to the initial ratio of
pyruvate to GLU. The exponential decay to these steady states slows down as α → 1,
and becomes algebraic decay in the limit.
There is further long-time behaviour that can occur in this system, though only for
certain parameter regimes. We discuss this behaviour in “Appendix B.1”.
3.4 Discussion
Of the reactions given in ( 1), ( 1c–f) are heterologous in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(that is, they are not native to the microorganism), and are the most appropriate targets
for enhancement. Thus, identifying and enabling the correct enzymes within cells for
these reactions is paramount. To this end, we discuss our results in the context of being
able to vary parameters from reactions ( 1c–f).
The general goal of the metabolic system we have considered is to maximise the
total 3HP produced, whilst minimizing the malonic semialdehyde ( S6) produced, as
the latter is toxic. The total 3HP produced at leading order, Ptot, can be obtained by
taking the limit as t →∞ in ( 7m), and is given by

The integral ( 12b) has asymptotic behaviour I ∼ 1a s α → 0, I ∼ 1/α as α →∞ ,
I ∼ 1a s Ω → 0f o r α< 1, I ∼ 1/α as Ω → 0f o r α> 1, and I ∼ √π/(2αΩ)
as Ω →∞ , which agree well with the numerical solutions of ( 12b) (Fig. 4). To
numerically evaluate ( 12b), we make the substitution u = e−s to switch to a ﬁnite
domain and use an asymptotic approximation to evaluate the integral near u = 0,
where the integrand has an integrable singularity.
The amount of S6 present in the system is at its maximum when t = O(1), and we
give an analytic expression for this in ( 7f), from which we see that

The function f is monotonically increasing in ω, and bounded above (Fig. 5). For
small ω, we ﬁnd that f ∼ ωu2e−u /4 ≈ 0.127ω where u satisﬁes e−u = 1 −u +u2/4
(thus, u ≈ 2.56). For large ω, we ﬁnd that f ∼ ue−u /2 ≈ 0.162 where u satisﬁes
e−u = 1 − u/2 (thus, u ≈ 1.59). The numerical approximations we give are all to
three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
From the solutions for the total 3HP produced, ( 12a), and the maximum value of
malonic semialdehyde, ( 13), we see that increasing ω will increase both metabolites,
but there is a limiting effect. Increasing ω corresponds to increasing the reaction rate
123
A kinetic model for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production... 181
through ( 1c), from aspartate to β-alanine, and thus we can deduce that this reaction
step is important to our goals, but there are diminishing returns.
There is a greater effect on the system from the pre-factor constants λand β6 = λ/¯k9
for 3HP and malonic semialdehyde, respectively. λ is a measure of the reaction rate
through ( 1d), from β-alanine to malonic semialdehyde and l-alanine, and we can
deduce that increasing the ﬂux through this reaction will result in higher levels of
3HP and malonic semialdehyde. Moreover, a larger value of ¯k
9 will result in a lower
maximum value of malonic semialdehyde, without affecting the levels of 3HP at
leading order. This physically corresponds to choosing or designing an enzyme to
which malonic semialdehyde will bind very quickly in the reaction ( 1f) from malonic
semialdehyde to 3HP . Moreover, we see that increasing λ, and hence increasing the
reaction rate through ( 1d), increases the levels of both 3HP and malonic semialdehyde
without diminishing returns. Thus, ( 1d) is an important reaction in the system with
regards to our goal, and the extra malonic semialdehyde produced by higher reaction
rates through this system could be balanced by increasing ¯k
9.
The reaction ( 1e), where l-alanine reacts with AKG to produce pyruvate and GLU,
and vice versa , is important for the long-time production of 3HP . The reversibility
of this reaction means that the initial pyruvate is stored as l-alanine, then is able to
be converted back into pyruvate due to the excess AKG produced by the reaction
(1b), from oxaloacetate and GLU to aspartate and AKG. This process provides more
pyruvate for the important reaction ( 1d), allowing it to proceed for a longer time.
Bypassing the long route to β-alanine from pyruvate is important for this system,
as the pyruvate runs out whilst the levels of β-alanine tend to a ﬁnite value. Thus,
diverting pyruvate from producing to reacting with β-alanine will result in a more
efﬁcient system and thus increase the total 3HP produced. This effect manifests in the
second term in ( 12a), where we ﬁnd that increasing β5, a measure of the backwards
r e a c t i o ni n(1e), from pyruvate to l-alanine, increases the total 3HP produced for the
reasons stated above. However, as the enzyme ALT used in this reaction also affects
the value of Ω, care must be taken in interpreting this result. In particular, a large value
of Ω will reduce the amount of 3HP produced (Fig. 4).
With regards to over- or under-expressing enzymes in the system, we can use Table 2
to determine that ω ∼ a1, λ ∼ a2, β5 ∼ a4, β6 ∼ a2/a3, and Ω ∼ a4, where a1, a2,
a3, and a4 relate to the initial concentrations of the enzymes PAND, BAPAT, HPDH,
and ALT, respectively, in the system. Hence, using the arguments presented above, we
may also deduce the following results for enzyme expression (a schematic of these
results is given in Fig. 6). Over-expressing PAND will monotonically increase the
levels of both 3HP and the maximum malonic semialdehyde present, but the effect of
this over-expression has diminishing returns and is bounded above. Similarly, over-
expressing BAPAT will also result in higher levels of both 3HP and the maximum
malonic semialdehyde present, but now without diminishing returns, as both scale
linearly with a
2. Over-expressing HPDH decreases the maximum level of malonic
semialdehyde present (scaling with 1 /a3), but has no leading-order effect on the levels
on 3HP . Finally, over-expressing ALT will increase the amount of 3HP produced
(scaling with √
a4 for large a4), without affecting the maximum (leading-order) level
of malonic semialdehyde present. Thus, the effect of over-expressing ALT does have
diminishing returns, but is not bounded above.

4 Continuously replenished pyruvate
4.1 Numerical results
We now investigate the system ( 4b–m), setting S1 ≡ 1. Thus, the concentration of
pyruvate is no longer governed by ( 4a). This models a system where pyruvate is
being constantly replenished and maintained at a given value. Solving this system
numerically, we see that there are two main timescales for 3HP production, where
t = O(1) and t = O(10
1), respectively (Fig. 7). In the t = O(1) timescale, the
levels of both malonic semialdehyde and 3HP are increasing, before the t = O(101)
timescale, where the levels of malonic semialdehyde increases at a much slower rate,
and the levels of 3HP tends to a constant production rate. There is a further timescale
when t = O(10
2), and the levels of malonic semialdehyde slightly increase to a steady
state in this timescale.
As with the never-replenished pyruvate case, the levels of malonic semialdehyde
and 3HP can vary signiﬁcantly when different enzymes are over-expressed. We show a
schematic for the metabolic network in Fig. 1. Increasing the initial amount of PAND
has no discernible effect on the levels of both malonic semialdehyde and 3HP . In
contrast, over-expressing BAPAT signiﬁcantly increases the levels of both malonic
semialdehyde and 3HP . We see that over-expressing HPDH does not appear to have
any effect on the levels of 3HP and, in fact, signiﬁcantly decreases the maximum
amount of malonic semialdehyde in the system. Finally, we see that over-expressing
ALT has a small positive effect on the levels of malonic semialdehyde overall (though
a small negative effect over t = O(10
1)), and a small negative effect on the levels of
3HP.
We proceed in the same manner as § 3, using an asymptotic analysis to explore the
system (4b–m), setting S1 ≡ 1. This will allow us to determine how the system depends

Fig. 7 Numerical solutions in the continuously replenished pyruvate case for the dynamic concentrations
of a malonic semialdehyde and b 3HP. We use the parameter values given in Table 2 for all simulations,
and initial dimensionless enzyme concentrations of 1 unless speciﬁed in the legend. The solid black line
corresponds to the reference simulation where ai = 1f o r i = 1,2, 3, 4
on the dimensionless parameters, and thus to explore the experimental parameter space
without resorting to computationally expensive parameter sweeps.
4.2 Asymptotic structure
As we did with § 3, we now consider this system by exploiting the small parameter, ε,
and using an asymptotic analysis. There are two main asymptotic regions of interest
in time, where t = O(1) and t = O(1/ε
1/2), and we refer to these as medium and
intermediate time, respectively (Fig. 7).
When t = O(1), the system is governed by the release of pyruvate through the main
pathway to 3HP and towards the production of l-alanine. There is a signiﬁcant increase
in the levels of all metabolites apart from pyruvate and GLU, the only metabolites that
are initially present. When t = O(1/ε1/2), the initial rate of metabolite production is
slowed and most metabolites approach their steady state. There is a further asymptotic
region when t = O(1/ε), and the system responds to the overproduction of l-alanine
due to the continuous replenishment of pyruvate. We consider this region in “Appendix
B.2 ”, as 3HP production is not affected by this redistribution. In the next section, we
solve the leading-order versions of the system ( 4b–m), with S
1 ≡ 1 in these asymptotic
regions.
4.3 Asymptotic solutions
The early-time behaviour of the system is the same as for the never-replenished case,
and this is given in “Appendix A”. The more interesting behaviour for malonic semi-
aldehyde and 3HP production occurs over longer timescales, which we now discuss
in turn.

where the parameters are deﬁned in ( 8). The solutions ( 15) show excellent agreement
with the numerical results (dashed lines in Fig. 8). As with the case considered in
§3, we did not have to impose all of the initial conditions to determine ( 15). That is,
there is an early-time solution as t → 0+. For early time, the diminishing pyruvate
case considered in the previous section is equivalent to the constant pyruvate case we
consider here. Thus, the early-time behaviour for this case is also given in “Appendix
A” and shows excellent agreement with the numerical results (dashed-dotted lines for
early time in Fig. 8).

These solutions show excellent agreement with the numerical results (dotted lines in
Fig. 8).
Similarly to the analysis in § 3, there is further long-time behaviour arising from
higher-order terms becoming important as lower-order terms exponentially decrease.
These can be obtained by proceeding to higher orders in the above analysis, but it
is simpler to investigate the asymptotic balances in ( 16) using the solutions ( 18). As
this does not affect the 3HP production at leading order, we discuss this in “Appendix
B.2”.
4.4 Discussion
We discuss our results in the same context as for the previous section. That is, we
consider the effect of varying parameters from the heterologous reactions ( 1c–f), and
with the goal of maximizing 3HP production whilst minimizing the maximum level
of malonic semialdehyde, S
6.
We see from the long-time solution ( 18l) that 3HP ends up being produced at a con-
stant rate λ/¯k2, and hence the concentration of 3HP ends up linearly increasing with
time. Additionally, from ( 18e), the concentration of malonic semialdehyde monoton-
ically increases and tends to a constant value of β6/¯k2 = λ/(¯k2 ¯k9). Hence, although
there are clear differences in the long-time behaviour of this system compared to the
never-replenished pyruvate case, there is a similar reaction dependence between sys-
tems. Speciﬁcally, whilst increasing the reaction rate through ( 1d), from β-alanine
to malonic semialdehyde and l-alanine, will result in greater levels of 3HP and mal-
onic semialdehyde, the levels of malonic semialdehyde produced can be reduced by

Fig. 9 A schematic to highlight the effect of over-expressing a given enzyme in the continuous replenish-
ment case on a malonic semialdehyde and b 3HP. The underlying network and the arrows between the nodes
are explained in Fig. 1. An enzyme that is boxed and red/green means that over-expressing this enzyme
causes a/an decrease/increase in the metabolite of interest. Our goal is to reduce the levels of malonic
semialdehyde whilst increasing the levels of 3HP, where possible (colour ﬁgure online)
increasing ¯k9. That is, by selecting an enzyme to which malonic semialdehyde has a
large binding afﬁnity.
In contrast to the never-replenished pyruvate case, the continuously-replenished
pyruvate case has no leading-order dependence on ( 1c), the reaction from aspartate
to β-alanine, nor on ( 1e), the reaction where l-alanine reacts with AKG to produce
pyruvate and GLU, and vice versa . Increasing the ﬂux through the former and the
reverse reaction of the latter had a positive effect on 3HP production, where the latter
allowed l-alanine to initially act as a pyruvate store, before releasing pyruvate to react
with β-alanine. Thus, for long-time, the rate of 3HP production and the levels of
malonic semialdehyde are only dependent on the reaction ( 1d), compared to § 3 where
these quantities are dependent on ( 1c–e).
With regards to over- or under-expressing enzymes in the system, we can use Table 2
to determine that λ ∼ a2 and ¯k9 ∼ a3, where a2 and a3 relate to the initial concen-
trations of the enzymes BAPAT and HPDH, respectively, in the system (a schematic
of these results is given in Fig. 9). Hence, using the arguments presented above, we
may also deduce that over-expressing BAPAT will result in higher levels of both 3HP
and the maximum malonic semialdehyde present, both scaling linearly with a
2.H o w -
ever, over-expressing HPDH decreases the maximum level of malonic semialdehyde
present, which is inversely proportional to a3, but has no leading-order effect on the lev-
els on 3HP . Importantly, we also ﬁnd that, in contrast to the non-replenished-pyruvate
case, there is no leading-order dependence on the initial concentrations of PAND or
ALT. Thus, our model suggests that the over-expression of PAND or ALT will not
result in signiﬁcant differences in the maximum level of malonic semialdehyde or the
3HP production for continuous replenishment of pyruvate.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we develop and solve a mathematical model for 3-hydroxypropionic acid
(3HP) production from pyruvate via aspartate and β-alanine. We consider two limit-

ing cases, where the initial level of pyruvate is never and continuously replenished,
respectively. In both cases, we make substantial asymptotic progress to gain physical
insight into the system behaviour, successfully comparing these results with numerical
solutions to check their accuracy. Our asymptotic model (including relatively straight-
forward explicit expressions) allows us to predict and quantify ways to increase the
levels of 3HP produced without increasing the levels of malonic semialdehyde, a toxic
compound produced as an intermediate in the pathway.
In terms of over-expressing enzymes, we ﬁnd that for both cases the strongest
positive effect comes from simultaneously over-expressing both BAPAT and HPDH.
This signiﬁcantly increase the levels of 3HP produced, but provides no signiﬁcant
increase in the maximum malonic semialdehyde present ((iii) in Figs. 10 and 11).
Our results also show that over-expressing just one of BAPAT or HPDH will not have
as strong an effect. We see a similar (though weaker) effect when over-expressing
ALT for a limited supply of pyruvate, and the maximum level of malonic semialde-
hyde is slightly reduced ((iv) in Fig. 10). However, when pyruvate is continuously
replenished, over-expressing ALT leads to a small increase in both the maximum level
of malonic semialdehyde and the rate of 3HP production ((iv) in Fig. 11). Finally,
over-expressing PAND only has a signiﬁcant effect when there is a limited supply of
pyruvate, where the over-expression leads to a slight increase in the maximum level of
malonic semialdehyde present ((ii) in Fig. 10). This effect vanishes when the pyruvate
is continuously replenished ((ii) in Fig. 11). We provide schematics outlining the effect
of over-expressing a given enzyme on both malonic semialdehyde and 3HP in Figs. 6
and 9 for the never and continuous replenishment cases, respectively.
Another approach to optimizing metabolite pathways is to explore alternative
enzymes for a given reaction. Our results can also be used to expedite this process, as
we are able to determine how the system behaves as a function of the kinetic parame-
ters of the enzymes, which will differ for alternative enzymes. Thus, we may interpret

our results to determine the optimal targets for enzyme replacement. We ﬁnd that,
in both cases, the kinetic parameters involving the enzyme BAPAT ( ¯k5, ¯k−5, and ¯k6,
deﬁned in Table 2) have the most signiﬁcant effect on 3HP production, and our model
suggests that focusing attention on maximizing the parameter grouping ¯k5 ¯k6/¯k−5 will
have the greatest effect on 3HP yield. Although increasing ¯k5 ¯k6/¯k−5 also has the effect
of increasing the levels of malonic semialdehyde, we further show that choosing an
HPDH enzyme to which malonic semialdehyde will quickly bind can negate this issue
(that is, increasing ¯k9, deﬁned in Table 2), and we show in Figs. 10 and 11 that this
combined effect of increasing the 3HP production whilst maintaining the maximum
level of malonic semialdehyde can also be achieved by over-expressing BAPAT and
HPDH.
We additionally show that the kinetic parameters involving the enzyme ALT ( ¯k
7,
¯k−7, ¯k8, and ¯k−8, deﬁned in Table 2) have a leading-order effect on the 3HP levels
when the initial level of pyruvate is never replenished. This is because the reversibility
of the reaction effectively allows pyruvate to be stored and converted back when
required. This storage effect is negligible in the continuous replenishment case as the
pyruvate is plentiful (by deﬁnition) and thus there is no beneﬁt to having additional
storage of pyruvate. The important parameter groupings here are ¯k
7 ¯k8/(¯k−7 + ¯k8)
and ¯k−7 ¯k−8/(¯k7 ¯k8), where increasing both of these dimensionless groupings leads to
more 3HP produced, with no effect on the maximum levels of malonic semialdehyde
present at leading order. We ﬁnd that the combined effect of these parameters means
that ¯k
−7 and ¯k−8 should be increased, whereas ¯k7 and ¯k8 should be decreased, and we
note that there are diminishing returns on increasing ¯k−7.W es h o wi nF i g .10 that this
effect can be weakly obtained by over-expressing ALT.
123

The kinetic parameters of the remaining enzyme we consider, PAND, given by ¯k3,
¯k−3, and ¯k4 deﬁned in Table 2, are only signiﬁcant at leading order in the never-
replenished pyruvate case. In this case, we ﬁnd that increasing the value of the
parameter grouping ¯k
3 ¯k4/¯k−3 increases both the amount of 3HP produced, and also the
maximum levels of malonic semialdehyde present. However, the effect of increasing
this parameter grouping is bounded above, and thus these diminishing returns suggest
that this parameter grouping is unlikely to be particularly useful to exploit for the
eventual goal of industrial production of 3HP .
We show that, although the full reaction dynamics are different between the never-
replenished and continuously-replenished pyruvate cases, there are general similarities
between predictions of the important reactions in both cases. Namely, our model
suggests that over-expressing BAPAT or using a version of BAPAT with different
kinetic parameters will increase levels of both 3HP and malonic semialdehyde, and
that over-expressing HPDH or using an alternate that can very quickly bind to malonic
semialdehyde will decrease the levels of malonic semialdehyde. The main differences
between the two cases are as follows. Firstly, the kinetic parameters involved in the
PAND and ALT reactions have a leading-order effect in the never-replenished pyruvate
case, but not in the continuously-replenished case. Secondly, the time taken to reach
the ‘long-time’ stage of 3HP production is asymptotically larger in the continuously-
replenished pyruvate case, an effect relating to the continuous production of 3HP in
this case. Thirdly, the malonic semialdehyde reaches its maximum value at a ﬁnite
time in the never-replenished case, but tends to its maximum (constant) value in the
continuously-replenished case.
We have made signiﬁcant use of asymptotic analysis in this paper. This method
has allowed us to determine the key parameter groupings involved in the production
of 3HP and malonic semialdehyde. Moreover, there are some interesting aspects of
the asymptotic analysis in its own right. For example, we have leading-order expo-
nentially decreasing terms that become subdominant to algebraically increasing terms.
Resolving this issue without going to higher asymptotic orders requires matching over
a timescale that involves logarithmic functions of the small parameter ε,a ss h o w ni n
“Appendix B.1”. Another interesting facet of the asymptotic analysis we perform is
that, in the never-replenished pyruvate case, there are effects that occur over two
asymptotic timescales that contribute to the levels of 3HP at leading order, and the
system behaviour over the longer timescale highlights how l-alanine acts as a store
for pyruvate, yielding deeper physical insight into the system.
The two limiting cases of pyruvate replenishment that we have considered in this
paper are chosen as modelling assumptions. In reality, the levels of pyruvate will fall
somewhere between these two extremes, as some time-dependent level of pyruvate will
be generated from glucose via glycolysis. Whilst our model does highlight the BAPAT
enzyme as the most important to 3HP production in both of the extreme cases we
consider, it may be interesting to investigate whether this is true for any given pyruvate
production. This could be examined by imposing a certain time-dependent form for the
pyruvate concentration (as we did by imposing that pyruvate was constant in the second
case we considered) if it were known, or by including a known source of pyruvate in the
governing equations and solving the full system. From ( 4), the governing equations for
O(1) time, we can see that the leading-order metabolite concentrations can be written
123
192 M. P. Dalwadi et al.
in terms of integrals of (time-dependent) imposed pyruvate concentrations or pyruvate
sources, and these are given in “Appendix C”. It may be instructive to analysis these
general results further.
Additionally, we chose somewhat arbitrary initial conditions which modelled the
instantaneous addition of pyruvate to a well-mixed solution of enzymes. In reality,
there is no clean starting point to such a set of reactions and there are likely to be small
initial levels of every metabolite. We have tested our results for small but non-zero
initial values of each metabolite and found that the early-time solutions we derived in
“Appendix A” were inaccurate, but that the system relaxed into the remaining solutions
we derived in this paper (results not shown).
Care must be taken with applying these results to in vivo experiments. Some of
the metabolite concentrations we have derived are very small and, whilst this is not
an issue for reactions occurring within a well-mixed beaker in vitro , it may pose a
problem if the situation being modelled is reactions occurring within cells. For one
molecule within a cell, the resulting macroscale concentration within a bacteria cell
would be roughly 10
−9 M ≈ ε3 S0 using the typical parameter values in this paper.
Hence, care needs to be taken when interpreting our results for reactions occurring
within bacterial cells. One option to accurately model a small number of molecules is
is to perform stochastic simulations of the molecule numbers, assigning a probability
of each reaction occurring. Additionally, for small numbers of molecules it may be
that spatial effects are important. It would be useful to include these extra features
in an extension of this work to check whether our conclusions still applied for in
vivo experiments, but we note that this would signiﬁcantly increase the computational
expense of solving the model.
Finally, we note that this work highlights how mathematical models can be used
to understand a complicated system, even one exhibiting nonlinear behaviour. From
our model, we were able to highlight the strong positive effect of over-expressing
two enzymes, BAPAT and HPDH, at the same time to increase 3HP production while
maintaining the levels of malonic semialdehyde. Such theoretical results should allow
signiﬁcant reductions in the time taken to explore the experimental parameter space,
and to aid in other ways the understanding of biological systems.

as t → 0+. These results are expansions in which t , rather than ε, is the small
parameter, and yield the earliest behaviour of the system. In Figs. 3 and 8,w es e e
that these asymptotic solutions agree very well with the numerical solutions at early
time. We note that these early-time solutions will be sensitive to any change in initial
conditions.
Appendix B: Long-time behaviour
In the main text, we have given the long-time behaviour of the system for times up
to the asymptotic orders at which the levels of 3HP are affected. There is further
interesting transient behaviour for the rest of the system and, in this Appendix, we
discuss this behaviour.
B.1 Never-replenished pyruvate
There is further long-time behaviour that can occur for the never-replenished pyruvate
case which physically corresponds to a slower decay of metabolites than predicted in
the main text. We see from the long-time solutions ( 11) that the metabolites that decay
have decay rates of |1 − α| or min (Ω, αΩ). Thus, if higher order terms have slower
decay rates than lower order terms in the long-time system ( 9), the asymptotic order
of terms will eventually switch. We ﬁnd that asymptotic switching occurs for α< 1
if and only if Ω< 1/α − 1, and for α> 1 if and only if Ω<α − 1 (Fig. 12a).
When α< 1 and Ω< 1/α − 1, we look into the region in ( 9) where

We see that these solutions are excellent approximations to the numerical solution.
This further long-time behaviour occurs when ( 1e), the reaction between l-alanine
and pyruvate, is slow. The physical interpretation of the solutions in this appendix
is that this slow reaction allows a slow replenishment of pyruvate which, in turn,
is converted through the metabolites in the pathway to β-alanine. This slow release
allows for a more gradual depletion of these intermediates.
B.2 Continuously-replenished pyruvate
There is further long-time behaviour that can occur for the continuously-replenished
pyruvate case which physically corresponds to some metabolites reaching a steady
state rather than vanishing as predicted in the main text. Using τ = T /ε
1/2 (and
hence t = T /ε) with the scalings ( ˆS2, ˆP) = ε−1/2( ˜S2, ˜P), ˆC4 = ε1/2 ˜C4, ( ˆS3, ˆC1) =
ε( ˜S3, ˜C1), and R1 = ε3/2 ˜R1, where all the new variables are O(1), the long-time

to avoid introducing a further boundary layer when T = (1/(2β4Ω)) log(1/ε)+O(1)
to switch the asymptotic order of terms. To give the O(ε1/2) terms for the remaining
metabolites, we would need to match with higher order terms from the t = O(ε−1/2)
region which, in turn, we would need to match with higher order terms from the
t = O(1) region. As we are satisﬁed with our current level of accuracy, we omit this
for brevity. The solutions ( B7) show excellent agreement with the numerical results
(dash-dotted lines for late time in Fig. 8).
The long-time behaviour ( B7) allows the levels of aspartate and l-alanine to attain
their correct steady state values which are limited by ( 1d), the BAPAT reaction. The
levels of aspartate sharply decrease when t = O(1/ε1/2) as aspartate is converted into
β-alanine which is free to react with all the excess pyruvate in the system. In ( B7),
this sharp decrease is balanced by a slow but steady conversion of pyruvate (through
oxaloacetate) into aspartate, allowing for a ﬁnite steady state. The levels of l-alanine
are artiﬁcially high when t = O(1/ε1/2) due to the reaction of β-alanine with all the
excess pyruvate into l-alanine (and malonic semialdehyde). This large production of
l-alanine is balanced in ( B7) by the conversion of l-alanine into pyruvate.
Appendix C: General solutions for t = O(1)
The general problem for t = O(1) is given by ( 6), ignoring the equation ˙S1 =− S1.
Instead, S1 is either imposed to be a speciﬁc function of time, or governed by
˙S1 = f (t ) − S1, (C1)
at leading order for small ε, where f (t )represents a time-dependent source of pyruvate.
In this paper, we have considered the cases f ≡ 0 and S1 ≡ 1 (equivalent to f ≡ 1
at leading order) in more detail, corresponding to no replenishment and continuous
replenishment of pyruvate, respectively. As ( C1)i ss o l v e db y
S1 = e−t +
∫ t

we can determine S1(t ) in either case. Hence, we give the solution to ( 6) in terms of
