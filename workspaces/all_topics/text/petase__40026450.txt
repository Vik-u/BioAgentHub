ABSTRACT: Waste polyesters are a potential feedstock for recycled and
upcycled products. These polymers are generally semicrystalline, which presents a
challenge for chemical and biological recycling to monomers, and thus the
thermodynamic work associated with polyester decrystallization is an important
consideration in some depolymerization strategies. Here, we use molecular
dynamics simulations to calculate the free energy required to decrystallize a single
chain from the crystal surface of five commercially and scientifically important,
semiaromatic polyesters (PET, PTT, PBT, PEN, and PEF) in water. Our results
indicate the decrystallization work ranges from approximately 15 kcal/mol (PEN)
to 8 kcal/mol (PEF) per repeat unit for chains in the middle of a crystal surface.
The insight gained into the molecular interactions that form the structural basis of
semicrystalline synthetic polyesters can guide the pursuit of more efficient plastic
processing, which could include catalyst development, optimizing recycling
conditions including pretreatment, enzyme and solvent selections, and design of new materials.

INTRODUCTION
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the world’s most
consumed polyester
1
and constitutes a potentially promising
carbon source for recycled and upcycled products.
2
In many
cases, PET deconstruction strategies rely on surface-driven
phenomena at a liquid−solid interface. For instance, biocatalytic
depolymerization of PET has been demonstrated since 2005,
3,4
and research efforts in this area have substantially increased since
Yoshida et al. reported the hydrolytic degradation and
assimilation of PET and its monomers, respectively, by Ideonella
sakaiensis.
5
Innovative nonbiological approaches have also
demonstrated depolymerization of PET via heterogeneous
6−9
and homogeneous
9−11
interfacial catalysis.
PET is generally semicrystalline, with a spatial distribution of
amorphous, crystalline, and rigid amorphous regions.
12,13
While
the overall crystalline fraction depends upon processing
conditions, PET crystallinity is typically reported between
10% and 40%
14−18
and can be as high as 50%,
15,19
a range that
enables its wide use in applications requiring structural integrity,
high heat resistance, and low permeability (e.g., beverage
bottles) and applications where tunable flexibility is necessary
(e.g., packaging films) as well as prevalent incorporation into
textiles.
14−18,20
The reported crystallinity of other polyesters
also varies significantly, which strongly influences performance,
especially mechanical and barrier properties. For example,
reported crystallinity for poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)
and poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) varies from 20 to
50%,
20−24
while poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) has a
slightly lower range of 15 to 40%.
21
PTT and PBT exhibit more
flexibility and faster crystallization rates than PET, properties
that are advantageous for elastic fiber production.
25,26
PEN is
also used in industrial fiber production,
27
exhibiting favorable
UV and chemical resistance, melt temperature, barrier proper-
ties, and tensile modulus.
28
Compared to PET, poly(ethylene
furanoate) (PEF) has an order-of-magnitude lower permeability
to both oxygen
29,30
and carbon dioxide,
31
a 10 °C-higher glass
transition temperature,
29
and can be sourced from biomass;
31,32
the reported crystallinity range for PEF is comparatively lower
and narrower at 10 to 20%.
33,34
Given their generally high
crystalline content, strategies for the complete and efficient
deconstruction of polyesters in solid form thus necessitate
interfacial catalysis,
35
and high crystallinity content can be a
hindrance, particularly to complete enzymatic deconstruction
because the ability of hydrolase enzymes to degrade the
crystalline regions is significantly lower than that of the
amorphous regions.
19,36−45
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are well-suited to
characterize the complex solid-solution interfacial interactions
for recalcitrant, semicrystalline polymers. This has been
demonstrated in the context of cellulose deconstruction by
cellulase enzymes, a scenario with strong analogy to that of PET
deconstruction. Therein, MD simulations have provided

also enabled a deeper understanding of the molecular roots of
biopolymer recalcitrance via detailed understanding of the
polymer−solution interface, including decrystallization
work
52−54
and the effect of catalytically induced surface
restructuring.
55
In the context of biologically based deconstruc-
tion approaches, high throughput MD simulations have also
been leveraged to effectively prescreen for highly active
enzymes. For example, Westh and co-workers have developed
workflows that exploit linear free energy relationships between
properties that are difficult to measure experimentally (e.g.,
enzymatic activity on semicrystalline polymeric substrate) and
those that are estimable via atomistic MD simulation (e.g.,
substrate binding energy).
56−59
Here, we have developed crystalline molecular models of five
polyesters with either current industrial importance or favorable
properties for potential future markets. MD simulations of these
models enable estimation of the thermodynamic work required
to decrystallize a single chain from the polymer crystal surface in
water, and analysis of these trajectories provides insight into the
molecular interactions that form the structural basis of
semicrystalline synthetic polyesters. The computational meth-
odology presented here can also be considered a framework to
quantify the effect on decrystallization of various alternative
processing conditions and can inspire the development of
targeted deconstruction strategies.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
The atomic coordinates for the unit cells of PET, PTT, PBT, PEN, and
PEF (Figure 1) were downloaded from the Cambridge Structural
Database (CSD)
60
or manually extracted from the original publications
presenting the crystal structures.
34,61−64
Further details, including
original references, CSD database identifiers, and unit cell parameters
are available in Supporting Information Table S1 and unit cell images
are available in Supporting Information Figure S1.
Initial system setup was performed in CHARMM version 44
65
and
subsequent minimization and dynamics were performed with NAMD
2.13.
66
The CHARMM C36 force field
67,68
was utilized for the
polymers with topologies and additional force field parameters
generated via the CHARMM generalized force field (CGenFF)
program version 2.5.
69,70
Further information is given in the Supporting
Information Methods. The TIP3P model was utilized for water.
71,72
In CHARMM, crystals were built with dimensions of 16 chains by 7
chains, and each chain had degree of polymerization (DP) equal to 12
with periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions. Chain ends
were covalently bonded across the periodic boundaries. The “vertical”
dimension of 16 chains for a sufficient solvation region to decrystallize a
chain into once 12 layers are removed to leave four layers in a
subsequent step. A “width” of 7 chains allows for decrystallizing chains
while avoiding edge effects as the crystal edges are beyond the nonbond
cutoff. A DP of 12 also ensures that the repeat units removed from the
crystal surface (once it has been created, vida infra) are beyond the
nonbond cutoff distance from the opposite end of the chain at all times.
Following system construction, NAMD was used for minimization
and MD simulations. First, a conjugate gradient minimization was
performed for 3000 steps on the initial “infinite” crystal. The box
volume and atomic positions were then equilibrated for 1 ns at constant
pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K). During NPT dynamics,
each dimension of the simulation box was allowed to fluctuate
independently. A Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 1.0
ps
−1
was used to maintain temperature at the target of each simulation.
Pressure was maintained at 1 atm using a modified Nose ́−Hoover
method
73
in which Langevin dynamics are used to control fluctuations
in the barostat
74,75
with a damping time of 100 fs and a period of 200 fs.
A nonbonded cutoff distance of 12 Å was utilized, with a switching
distance applied between 10 and 12 Å, and a nonbonded pair list
distance of 16 Å. The long-range electrostatics were described via the
particle mesh Ewald (PME) method
76
with a sixth-order β-spline and 1
Å grid spacing. The velocity Verlet timestepping integration method
was used, with the full nonbonded and electrostatics interactions
evaluated on every time step. For all dynamics simulations, a time step
of 2 fs was used. The SETTLE algorithm
77
was used to keep bond

Following NPT equilibration, chains were slightly shortened
(resulting in chains with 11 repeat units) and capped with aliphatic
alcohol motifs (Figure 2), and the crystal was trimmed to 7 chains wide
by 4 chains deep and solvated in sufficient water to ensure a large
solvated gap between each periodic images of the crystal (Supporting
Information Figure S2). NAMD was again utilized to perform a
conjugate gradient minimization for 3000 steps on the solvated system,
followed by 1 ns density equilibration in the NPT ensemble at 300 K.
Starting with this NPT simulation, restraints were placed on the bottom
two layers of the crystal. Specifically, a harmonic restraint is applied to
the heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms of the bottom two layers with force
constants of 4.0 kcal/mol/Å
2
(bottom layer) and 1.0 kcal/mol/Å
2
(second layer from bottom); the top two layers of the crystal were
completely unrestrained. A 10 ns NVT run followed the NPT
equilibration.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The initial 10 ns NVT simulation for each polyester served both
as equilibration in preparation for decrystallization simulations
and also gave the opportunity to characterize various dynamical
traits of the crystalline phase for these polyesters. Root mean
square deviation (RMSD, Supporting Information Figure S3)
analysis demonstrates the rapid equilibration of the solvated
polymer crystals, and general trends from the atom-by-atom
root mean squared fluctuations (RMSF, Supporting Information
Figure S4) include that, as expected, the mobility of edge chains
is greater than that of middle chains and the mobility of chain
ends is greater than that of chain interiors. In this regard, PBT
displays the largest difference between edge and middle chains,
whereas PTT edge chains display similar RMSF to middle
chains. All polyesters considered here lack intracrystalline
“strong” hydrogen bonds, because the polyesters lack hydrogen
atoms bonded to oxygens, with the exception of at the chain
ends. However, each polyester participates as a receptor in
hydrogen bonds with water molecules (Supporting Information
Figure S5a,b), with approximately one strong hydrogen bond
per repeat unit for middle chains and 1.5 per repeat unit for edge
chains on average. PEF is an outlier to this trend, having
considerably fewer hydrogen bonds with water. A significant
number of weak hydrogen bonds (defined as O···H−C, oxygen
to carbon distance ≤3.5 Å and the O−H−C angle ≤60°) are
present, and more prominent differentiation between the
different polyesters (Supporting Information Figure S5c−f).
Solvent accessible surface area (SASA, Supporting Information
Figure S6) can serve as an indicator of polymer accessibility to
catalysts, including enzymes. For both middle and edge chains,
PEN has the highest accessible surface area to water, though its
naphthalene moiety also produces the largest repeat unit of the
five polyesters. In contrast, PEF has a smaller aromatic ring, yet
has the highest number of weak hydrogen bond interactions for
both middle and edge chains.
Before proceeding with decrystallization simulations, the
particular crystalline faces from which to decrystallize a chain
need to be identified. We aimed to identify the most
hydrophobic face because this is the most likely face for
adsorption of hydrolytic enzymes, which have been shown to
adsorb with high affinity to the PET surface.
79,80
The
hydrophobicity of polyesters also has a strong impact on
processing, performance, and end-of-life recycling strategies.
Water contact angle is an efficient method for estimating surface
hydrophobicity, which we determined with the following
procedure. The water contact angle for PET was examined via
MD (Figure 3) on the 100, 010, and 001 crystalline faces, the
normal vectors of which are related to the thickness, width, and
length of crystallites, respectively.
13,81
Following the method of
Kanduc,
82
a cylindrical water droplet, infinite along the axis of
the droplet, was prepared. This approach involves three phase
contact lines whose lengths are independent of droplet size, thus
reducing their influence on the contact angle estimate. The
details of the analysis of these simulations are described in
Supporting Information Figure S7.
The contact angle results (Figure 3) indicated that the 100
face of PET has the highest contact angle of those examined and
is thus the most hydrophobic. For subsequent decrystallization,
we thus target this face, which is parallel to the aromatic ring of
the PET repeat unit, and for consistency, we chose for each of
the other polyesters the face whose plane normal is parallel to
the aromatic ring normal. For PTT, PBT, PEN, and PEF, these
faces are the 100, 100, 100, and 010, respectively (Supporting
Information Figure S1). The contact angle estimated here via
MD for the 100 face of PET is slightly lower but in reasonable
agreement with experimental measurements
83−85
and computa-
tional predictions
86
for PET water contact angle, which are
generally in the range of 72 to 83°. In addition, the finding that
the most hydrophobic face for PET is parallel to the plane of the
aromatic ring is analogous to the situation for cellulose,
87
whose
hydrophobic 100 face (parallel to the plane of surface glucose
rings) has been shown to be the preferential binding face for
carbohydrate binding modules.
88−90
The free energy to decrystallize a single chain from the
selected hydrophobic face was calculated for each polyester via
umbrella sampling in NAMD.
91,92
The order parameter used to
describe the decrystallization process is the fraction of contacts
between the extracted chain and the crystal, ranging from 1
(intact crystal) to 0 (complete decrystallization).
52
The number
of contacts was calculated via the NAMD colvars module as the
number of heavy atoms in the first four repeat units of the
decrystallizing chain with all other heavy atoms in the rest of the
crystal, excluding atoms in the rest of the partially decrystallized
chain. The cutoff distance for two atoms to be considered in
contact was 12.0 Å. This value was chosen because it
corresponds to the nonbond cutoff distance such that the four
repeat units in the fully decrystallized state have no dispersive

to the plane of the page. In panels (a−c), the axis of the PET chains is also into the page; the 001 surface (d) exposes the chain ends (hydroxyl groups),
which are in contact with the water. Overlaid on panels (a−c) are the average and standard deviation for water contact angle for the final 50 ns of a 100
ns MD simulation (Supporting Information Figure S7).

interactions with the remaining crystal. The potential of mean
force (PMF) could be affected by the choice of the contacts
cutoff if it is less than the nonbonded cutoff distance because the
decrystallized chain would have dispersive interactions with the
surface in that case. Further details on this order parameter are
available Supporting Information Figure S8. This choice of four
repeat units was inspired by the structure and size of the binding
channel of the I. sakaiensis PETase enzyme.
5,93,94
Induced fit
docking results have demonstrated that four repeat units of PET
can fit into this binding channel (Figure 4a).
94,95
We also note
that decrystallizing four repeat units actually pulls more than
four repeat units out of the surface because these four repeat
units have to be at least 12 Å away from the surface when the
contacts order parameter goes to zero (Figure 4b).
The above procedure was applied to decrystallizing both a
middle chain and an edge chain; Figure 4b shows examples for
both decrystallization scenarios of four repeat units decrystall-
izing from the 100 face of PET. Edge chains are expected to be
among the easiest to digest while middle chains are likely the
most difficult, thus most other chain scenarios within the
polymer crystals will likely fall within these limits. As shown in
Figure S4, the chain ends are significantly more mobile than the
chain interiors, and thus more accessible to solvent (and likely to
enzyme active sites) as their position fluctuates into solution.
Increased chain flexibility and water accessibility (characteristic
of chain ends in our simulations) have been previously
correlated with enhanced PET degradation rates by polyester
hydrolases.
96,97
In addition, mass loss of PET samples when
incubated with polyester hydrolases is indicative of the release of
oligomers or monomers via a degradation mechanism initiated
at chain ends.
39
For these reasons, we focused on decrystalliza-
tion from chain ends, which also enables direct comparison with
prior biopolymer decrystallization results.
52,53
The initial number of contacts in the fully intact crystal for
each polyester was calculated from the unrestrained 10 ns NVT
simulation described above. The initial configurations for each
umbrella sampling window were generated via a subsequent
steered MD simulation from this initial number of contacts to
zero contacts. During steered MD trajectory, the pulling force
constant applied to the collective variable was equal to 0.75 kcal/
mol/(contacts)
2
and the total pulling trajectory length was 30
ns. Atomic coordinates saved every 0.6 ns were used as the initial
configurations for the umbrella sampling windows.
During umbrella sampling simulations, a harmonic restraint
was applied to heavy atoms on the bottom layer of the polymeric
crystal to prevent them from drifting (force constant of 1.0 kcal/
mol/Å
2
). We utilized a total of 50 windows, with a biasing
potential force constant of 0.0001 kcal/mol/(contacts)
2
. Each
umbrella sampling window was simulated for 30 ns total at 300 K
in the NVT ensemble. Supporting Information Figure S9
presents a representative example of overlapping umbrella
sampling histograms for PET. Probability distributions from the
final 10 ns were utilized for free energy calculations. The PMF is
obtained from the umbrella sampling simulations via the
variational free energy perturbation (vFEP) method.
98
The
bootstrapping
99
method was used for free energy error
estimation.
Umbrella sampling simulations were performed for middle
and edge chains for each polyester, as illustrated in Figure 4b.
For both scenarios, each PMF monotonically increased from the
fully intact crystal (scaled contacts equal to 1) to a maximum
near zero contacts (i.e., 4 repeat units fully decrystallized) in all
systems (Figure 5). For middle chains, the trend in
decrystallization work is as follows: PEN (∼62 kcal/mol) >
PTT (∼58 kcal/mol) > PBT (∼55 kcal/mol) > PET (∼45 kcal/
mol) > PEF (∼32 kcal/mol) (Figure 5a); each value is for
decrystallization of four repeat units.
For edge chains (Figure 5b), the PMFs monotonically
increase as with the middle chain, but with significantly lower
decrystallization work. The observed trend of PEN > PTT >

PBT > PET > PEF holds for the edge chain scenario, and the
decrystallization work for each is roughly half that of the middle
chain case. For both middle and edge chains, four “shoulders”
are seen for each system; these represent the stepwise
detachment of repeat units from the crystal surface. For middle
chains, PEN has the highest decrystallization work (Figure 5a)
as well as the highest number of weak intracrystalline hydrogen
bonds (Supporting Information Figure S5c). However, PEN
also displays the highest decrystallization work for edge chains
(Figure 5b), but the least number of weak hydrogen bonds
(Supporting Information Figure S5d). This is suggestive that
polymer−polymer hydrogen bonds are not the key driver in the
recalcitrance of polyesters to decrystallization. In Figure 6, the
decrystallization work per repeat unit is computed for each
scenario as the maximum in the PMF divided by the number of
repeat units that were decrystallized.
Generally, the net change in free energy for the process of
decrystallization is due to all thermodynamic changes of all
species, i.e. all energetic and entropy contributions including
pulling apart a crystal, creating a void in the solvent, as well as
new energetic interactions and entropies of water-crystal and
water-dissolved polymer. The PMF profiles in this study for each
polyester can be correlated to some extent with distinct chemical
and physical attributes of the polymers. For example, the
naphthalene moieties in the PEN backbone could lead to
stronger π−π stacking interactions compared to the single
aromatic rings in PET, PTT, and PBT, and may contribute to
PEN’s exceptionally high decrystallization work. Naphthalene
groups have larger conjugated systems compared to simple
benzene rings, and this extended aromatic system can result in
stronger interactions with the crystal surface during decrystal-
lization. Also, PBT contains a longer aliphatic chain (butylene)
in its backbone compared to PET (ethylene), which may
contribute to larger hydrophobic regions that are harder to
dissolve in water and thus translate into higher decrystallization
free energies. By the same logic, PTT may be expected to fall in
between PET and PBT given its three-carbon aliphatic region,
yet it shows a decrystallization work that is higher than all
studied polyesters except PEN. We surmise that PTT’s high
decrystallization work may be related to the physical arrange-
ment of chains within its crystal structure, which displays a
unique zigzag pattern (Figure 2) quite different from PET and
PBT, both of which display roughly planar chain configurations.
Aromatic stacking interactions is another important factor in
the decrystallization work. PEF, with the lowest decrystallization
work, contains furan rings in its backbone. A density functional
theory (DFT) study calculated energy landscapes for various
aromatic heterocyclic molecules with benzene,
100
and although
furan−furan stacking interactions were not calculated, furan’s
stacking interaction with benzene was shown to be the weakest
interaction of all molecules considered. Benzene has a
symmetric, nonpolar structure, whereas furan, with its
heteroatom, has slightly weaker stacking interactions due to
the influence of its polar nature and the electronic effects of ring
oxygen.
100
PEF also has a unique crystal structure in which
chains display furan rings of alternating orientation as well as
shifting longitudinally from neighbors in adjacent layers.
34
We
note also that the classical force field utilized here accounts for
π−π stacking only implicitly through nonspecific van der Waals
forces and electrostatic interactions between aromatic systems.
This approximation may not fully capture the directionality and
strength variations seen in actual π−π interactions, but the
present results, in combination with experimental observations
and DFT modeling, can give additional insights into how these
interactions may affect polymer decrystallization.
The results for decrystallization work shown in Figures 5 and
6 demonstrate the stability of synthetic polyesters. This can be
illustrated by comparison to cellulose, the world’s most
abundant biopolymer and itself a recalcitrant semicrystalline
polymer.
101
A previous study estimated the decrystallization free
energies for various cellulose polymorphs
52
and calculated the
decrystallization work for a middle chain of cellulose Iβ as 6.7
kcal/mol per cellobiose (the repeat unit of cellulose, a β,1-4
linked glucose dimer). The current study indicates significantly
higher decrystallization work for synthetic polyesters. For
example, PET exhibits a decrystallization energy of approx-
imately 11.5 kcal/mol per repeat unit for a middle chain,
indicating a decrystallization work per repeat unit that is 1.72×
higher for PET middle chains as compared to cellulose. This
contrast is even more drastic when one considers that the repeat
unit of cellulose contains two “ring units” (i.e., glucose) whereas
that of PET has only one, indicating a “per ring” decrystallization
work that is 3.43× higher for PET than cellulose. Interestingly,
the energy needed to decrystallize edge chains for the two
polymers is more similar (cellulose Iβ 5.4 kcal/mol per
cellobiose; PET 5 kcal/mol per repeat unit). For the polyesters
presented here, the free energy required to decrystallize an edge
chain is roughly half that for the middle chain case. Unrestrained
MD trajectories indicate that edge chains generally exhibit
higher RMSF, less frequent polymer−polymer hydrogen
bonding, and higher SASA than middle chains (Supporting
Information Figures S4, S5c-d, and S6), any or all of which may
contribute to their more facile decrystallization. Since the edge
chains of the polymeric crystal surface require less free energy to
detach than middle chains, they are likely to be detached
preferentially, a conclusion also reached for recalcitrant
biopolymers.
52,53
Additionally, when a middle chain is removed,
two new edge chains are created, thereby reinforcing the
predominance of edge chain removal in the process. A detailed
understanding of the surface morphology of polyester crystals,
when coupled with the current quantitative results for
decrystallization work, would enable the construction of kinetic
models describing the full catalytic cycle of polyester hydrolase
enzymes.

Our findings on the work required to decrystallize a single
polyester chain may help rationalize certain trends in
experimentally determined polyester hydrolase activity. PETase
enzymes generally have much lower activity on crystalline
substrates than amorphous,
36−43,102−104
and the exceptionally
high decrystallization work required for polyesters reported here
may provide a rationale for this: perhaps PETases are not able to
depolymerize the crystalline regions efficiently because they are
unable to decrystallize them. The relative inability of PETase
enzymes to decrystallize the crystalline regions has important
implications for process choices, notably substrate pretreat-
ment
105,106
and economics of recycling strategies.
107,108
Under-
standing the relative free energies for the full catalytic cycles of
PETase enzymes, including decrystallization, is an important
consideration in further biocatalyst development.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study provides a comparative analysis of the
work to decrystallize synthetic polyesters into water, thereby
enhancing our understanding of their behavior under conditions
that may mimic the early stages of enzymatic and chemical
recycling processes under mild conditions. The present study
can be conceived of as a framework wherein the effect of
alternative processing conditions can be quantified, including
the effect of decrystallizing the polymer into an organic solvent,
solutions with varying salt content, or even into the active site of
an enzyme. Such studies are promising topics for future studies
and could spur development of targeted deconstruction
strategies, potentially eliminating the need for melt-amorphiza-
tion before enzymatic depolymerization of PET and other
energy-intensive pretreatments for various polymers. Finally,
this framework can also be applied to other plastics (e.g., nylons)
or may even drive the design of novel materials tailored for more
efficient decrystallization and recycling.
