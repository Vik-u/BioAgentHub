Translational Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Model
for mRNA-3927, an Investigational Therapeutic
for the Treatment of Propionic Acidemia
Husain Attarwala,1 Matthew Lumley,1 Min Liang,1 Vijay Ivaturi,2 and Joe Senn1
Propionic acidemia (PA) is an ultrarare disorder caused by deﬁciency of the mitochondrial enzyme, propionyl-
CoA carboxylase (PCC), composed of PCCA and PCCB subunits. An enzyme replacement therapy is being
developed using dual messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy composed of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating
mRNAs encoding PCCA and PCCB subunits of the PCC enzyme. We herein report on development of a
translational semimechanistic pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) model to quantify the re-
lationship between the mRNA components of mRNA-3927 (an LNP encapsulating PCCA and PCCB mRNAs)
and dose levels; PCCA/B mRNA PK and PD responses were assessed as circulating levels of primary disease
markers 2-methyl citrate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionyl carnitine normalized to acetyl carnitine (C3/C2
ratio) to inform the ﬁrst-in-human dose range and regimen selection. The translational PK/PD model was de-
veloped using preclinical data available in mice with PA, Sprague Dawley rats, and cynomolgus monkeys at dose
levels ranging from 0.2 to 9 mg/kg. PCCA/B mRNA PK in mice, rats, and monkeys was adequately described
using allometric scaling of volume and clearance parameters. The interspecies preclinical model was scaled
allometrically to humans to predict the dose–response relationship in adult and pediatric patients with PA to guide
selection of dose range and regimen for the Phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer NCT04159103).

Introduction
P
ropionic acidemia (PA) is an ultrarare metabolic
disorder that manifests during infancy and early child-
hood and is characterized by a deﬁciency of propionyl-CoA
carboxylase (PCC), an enzyme that catalyzes the conver-
sion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. The patho-
physiology of PA stems from defective or deﬁcient
expression of PCC protein, which is encoded by PCCA and
PCCB genes. Dysfunction in the PCC enzyme results in
a metabolic block in the propionate metabolism path-
way, leading to metabolic acidosis marked by elevated lev-
els of metabolites, including 2-methyl citrate (2-MC),
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), and propionyl carnitine nor-
malized to acetyl carnitine (C3/C2) ratio [1,2]. There are
two disease subtypes classiﬁed based on deﬁciency of either
the PCCA subunit (Type I) or the PCCB subunit (Type II):
the dual messenger RNA (mRNA) targets both disease sub-
types [2–6].
Previously published data using a disease model of PA in
mice provided compelling preclinical proof of concept for
dual mRNA therapy (mRNA-3927) as a potential disease-
modifying treatment that addresses the underlying meta-
bolic defect for PCCA- and PCCB-deﬁcient subtypes of PA.
These studies also comprehensively aided in establishing the
long-term efﬁcacy and safety of a systemically administered
combination mRNA therapeutic as an enzyme-replacement
approach. The data described therein support the clinical
development of mRNA-3927 as a therapeutic for this dev-
astating pediatric disorder [7].

Herein, we report on the development of a translational
semimechanistic pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic
(PD) model of mRNA-3927. The purpose of the integrated
analyses was to quantitatively characterize the PK and PD
responses of mRNA-3927 in nonclinical species and pre-
dict the dose–response relationship between mRNA-3927
and PD endpoints in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients
with PA to guide dose selection for the Phase 1 clinical trial.
Materials and Methods
Data used for model development
Pharmacokinetic studies. PCCA mRNA data were
available from mice deﬁcient in PCC [(Strain Code: 4011020
(A138T) PCCA -/-); N = 111], juvenile Sprague Dawley
rats ( N = 19), and cynomolgus monkeys ( N = 16). Mice
received a single intravenous (IV) bolus dose of 1 and
2 mg/kg of mRNA-3927. Juvenile Sprague Dawley rats
received 3 IV bolus doses at 1, 3, and 9 mg/kg every 2 weeks.
Cynomolgus monkeys received 3 IV bolus doses at 1, 3,
and 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected
at predetermined time points postdose: up to 48 h from mice
and up to 96 h from juvenile Sprague Dawley rats and
cynomolgus monkeys. Experimental protocols were app-
roved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Moderna, Inc., and complied with all relevant ethical
regulations regarding the use of research animals.
Pharmacodynamic studies. The PD of mRNA-3927 was
evaluated in mice deﬁcient in PCC [(Strain Code: 4011020
(A138T) PCCA -/-); N = 111] after a single IV dose or
multiple IV doses. The PD response of mRNA-3927 was
assessed as hepatic production of PCC protein and plasma
concentrations of 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2 ratio levels after a
single IV bolus dose of mRNA-3927 (0.2, 0.5, 1, and
2 mg/kg) or after multiple IV bolus doses of mRNA-3927 (0.5
and 2 mg/kg) administered once every 3 weeks (q3W) for
12 weeks (total of 4 doses).
Model development
The overall model development was executed in a step-
wise manner (Fig. 1) as follows: (1) Plasma concentration–
time proﬁles of PCCA/B mRNA in mice, rats, and monkeys
were modeled using a semimechanistic PK model with
allometric scaling of volume and clearance parameters; (2)
PCC protein expression rate was modeled as a linear func-
tion of plasma PCCA/B mRNA concentration using a
2-compartment indirect response PD model with an empiri-
cal effect compartment; (3) PCC protein-mediated reduction
of 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2 ratios was modeled using a direct
sigmoidal maximum inhibition ( I
max) model; and (4) the
PK/PD model was extrapolated to humans using allometric
scaling of PK parameters, and the expected plasma 2-MC
proﬁles after q3W dosing at various dose levels were simu-
lated to guide selection of doses for the ﬁrst-in-human clinical
study. Model equations are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Population analyses were conducted using nonlinear
mixed-effects modeling using Pumas software, Version 2.0
(Pumas AI). The ﬁrst-order conditional estimation with
interaction (FOCEI) method was employed for all model
runs, except for the 3-HP PD model, where the Laplacian
method was used. Data sets were prepared using R 3.6.
Graphics were constructed through either R or the program
GraphPad Prism 8.2. Assessments of model adequacy were
guided by goodness-of-ﬁt criteria, including (1) visual in-
spection of diagnostic scatterplots (observed vs. predic-
ted concentration, residual/weighted residual vs. predicted
concentration or time), (2) successful convergence of the
minimization routine, (3) plausibility of parameter estimates,
and (4) visual predictive checks.
Results
Pharmacokinetic model for PCC mRNA
A semimechanistic PK model was found to suitably
describe the observed delayed Cmax in nonhuman primates
where maximal PCC mRNA (PCCA +PCCB mRNA) con-
centrations were reached 4 h after mRNA-3927 IV infusion
(data not shown), suggesting a distribution and redistribu-
tion PK pattern. Plasma concentration–time proﬁles of PCC
mRNA from mice, rats, and monkeys were ﬁtted simulta-
neously to the semimechanistic PK model to estimate all
model parameters, including body weight–based allometric
exponents for clearance. The population PK model converged
successfully with reasonable percentage of residual standard
error (% RSE) estimates. Parameter estimates are shown in
Table 1. Model ﬁts and goodness-of-ﬁt plots are shown in
Figs. 2A and 3, respectively. Model diagnostics suggested
that the model adequately described the PCCA mRNA PK in
mice, rats, and monkeys with a lack of any systematic bias.
PK/PD model for hepatic PCC protein
A liver concentration–time proﬁle of PCC protein
(PCCA+PCCB) was described using a 2-compartment

indirect response PD model where the synthesis rate of PCC
protein increased linearly with an increase in plasma PCC
mRNA concentration through an effect compartment.
An effect compartment was incorporated into the semi-
mechanistic model for population PK/PD to account for the
slight hysteresis or delayed onset and longer duration of
effect observed after IV administration of mRNA-3927 lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs). Furthermore, a 2-compartment model
for PCC protein was needed to adequately capture the biex-
ponential decline of PCC protein observed in the terminal
phase.
The PK/PD model converged successfully, and parame-
ters were estimated with reasonable % RSE, indicating the
reliability of the estimated parameters’ value (Table 1). The
observed and ﬁtted PCC concentration–time proﬁle is
shown in Fig. 2B, which indicates that the model adequately
described the PCC synthesis and time course in mice after
an IV bolus dose. The model estimated a half-life of PCC
protein of *7 days.
PK/PD model for plasma 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2 ratio
in PCC-deﬁcient mice
The transitional semimechanistic PK/PD model converged
successfully with reasonable % RSE estimates. Parameter
estimates are shown in Table 1. Model ﬁtted individual plots
are shown in Supplementary Figs. S1–S3 and goodness-of-ﬁt
plots are shown in Fig. 4; these data indicate that the model
adequately describes the plasma 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2
responses in mice with a lack of systematic bias. Visual
predictive check for 3-HP at doses of >0.5 mg/kg showed
that the model-predicted median was greater than that for
the observed data (data not shown); this result was likely
due to limitations of the preclinical 3-HP assay because
several observations were below the limit of quantiﬁcation
of 25 mM/L after administration of mRNA-3927.
The concentration of liver PCC protein needed for 50%
inhibition of plasma 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2 was estimated
as 21.0, 37.5, and 32.1 mg/g, respectively. The 2-MC
base,
3-HPbase, and C3/C2 base parameters represent plasma levels
of corresponding biomarkers that are susceptible to sup-
pression by PCC protein expressed through mRNA-3927 in
mice; the E02-MC,E 03-HP, and E0C3/C2 parameters represent
plasma levels of corresponding biomarkers that are not sus-
ceptible to PCC expressed after IV administration of mRNA-
3927. Based on parameter estimates in Table 1, *63.7%,
99.8%, and 86.9% of total plasma 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2,
respectively, was amenable to suppression by mRNA-3927–
mediated expression of PCC protein in PCC-deﬁcient mice.

C3/C2 ratio was maintained at q3W doses of ‡2 mg/kg in

marker suppression was predicted to reduce with an increase
in dose.

described earlier, estimated allometric exponent was 0.63

exponent for the volume of distribution parameters (ie, V and

Discussion
Safe and effective therapies for the treatment of rare dis-
eases remain a substantial unmet medical need. PA is an
ultrarare devastating pediatric disorder caused by PCC
enzyme deﬁciency that results in impaired propionate
metabolism and the abnormal accumulation of toxic metab-
olites in the body [1,2]. mRNA-3927 is a novel enzyme
replacement therapy consisting of dual mRNAs encoding a
functional PCC enzyme [7]. mRNA technology has trans-
formed the therapeutic landscape in terms of mechanism of
drug delivery and action, utilizing systemic delivery of
mRNA through LNPs and allowing the endogenous transla-
tional machinery of the cell to produce therapeutic proteins
[8–10].

The aim of the current investigation was to develop a
translational PK/PD model to guide dose selection for the
ﬁrst-in-human clinical study in patients with PA. We devel-
oped a translational semimechanistic PK and PK/PD model
to quantify the relationship between mRNA-3927 dose,
PCCA/B mRNA, and PK and PD responses to guide dose
selection for the Phase 1 clinical study of mRNA-3927 in
adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with PA.
In our analyses, we took a stepwise approach to develop-
ing the translational model, initially characterizing the PK
of PCCA/B mRNA in mice, rats, and monkeys. Our results
demonstrated that the plasma PK of PCCA/B mRNA was
adequately described by a semimechanistic PK model,
and that allometric scaling of PK parameters adequately
described the plasma concentrations of PCCA/B mRNA.
Next, in the PD assessments of mRNA-3927 in mice deﬁ-
cient in PCC, PCC protein expression proﬁles were shown to
be adequately described using a linear function of plasma
PCCA/B mRNA concentration through an empirical effect
compartment.
The model estimated a PCC protein half-life of 7 days.
PCC protein-mediated reduction of 2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2
ratio was also adequately described by the model. Evaluation
of relationship between mRNA-3927 dose and PD respon-
ses showed that near maximal suppression of plasma 2-MC,
3-HP, and C3/C2 ratio was maintained at q3W doses of
2 mg/kg in mice. To inform starting dose and dose range
selection for the ﬁrst-in-human clinical study in patients
with PA ( >1 year of age), this preclinical PK/PD model
was subsequently extrapolated to humans based on allo-
metric scaling of model parameters and was used to sim-
ulate PD responses at different dose levels and dosing
intervals.
Although this model could successfully predict peak bio-
marker reductions at steady state and recovery in humans,
further reﬁnements were limited due to heterogeneity of
residual PCC enzyme levels in animal models and by the
sparse literature on the biochemical interplay between 2-MC,
3-HP, and C3/C2 containing pathways. Regardless of these
limitations, the semimechanistic model suitably predicted
observed biomarker responses regardless of the investiga-
tional species.
Toxic accumulation of 3-HP, methylcitric acid, and/or
methylmalonic acid in plasma, urine, and other body ﬂuids
due to deﬁciency of PCC results in devastating clinical
complications in patients with PA, affecting neurologic,
cardiologic, hematologic, immunologic, and gastrointestinal
systems [11,12]. Current management of patients with PA is
inadequate and does not address the underlying defect of
the disorder [13]. Carglumic acid, a structural analogue of

PK/PD MODEL FOR mRNA THERAPEUTIC FOR PROPIONIC ACIDEMIA 145
N-acetylglutamate that activates the ﬁrst enzyme in the urea
cycle, is approved in the European Union for the treatment of
hyperammonemia due to PA [14].
Recent preclinical studies comparing dual mRNAs
(mRNA-3927) with carglumic acid showed that although
plasma ammonia was normalized in mice treated with either
agent, only dual mRNAs resulted in reductions in plasma
2-MC, 3-HP, and C3/C2 ratio, as well as reductions in tissue
2-MC and increased PCC activity in the liver [7]. Thus,
unlike carglumic acid, dual mRNAs addressed the underly-
ing defect in PA by restoring propionate metabolism in the
liver of PCC-deﬁcient mice.
The PK/PD model described herein will be utilized to
inform an optimal mRNA-3927 dose that is expected to
yield a substantial reduction of plasma 2-MC in patients
with PA. The interspecies predictability of PCCA mRNA
between mice, rats, and monkeys based on allometric scal-
ing provided the rationale for allometric prediction of human
PK, with the concentration of PCC protein needed for 50%
suppression of plasma 2-MC assumed to be similar in mice
and humans. Evaluating a wide range of dose levels and
regimens to determine an appropriate dose and schedule for
novel agents in Phase 1 clinical studies can be very difﬁ-
cult; this is particularly evident for small patient populations,
as it can be time consuming, costly, or not feasible, and
may be disadvantageous for patients who are exposed to
suboptimal or supratherapeutic dose levels.
Translational PK/PD models are increasingly utilized
to support clinical development by allowing more efﬁcient
patient enrollment and dose selection for rationally designed
trials [15,16]. Results from the current model will be used to
inform the design of the ongoing ﬁrst-in-human Phase 1/2
study evaluating mRNA-3927 in participants 1 year of age
and older with PA (NCT04159103) [17]. Our study repre-
sents further progress toward a disease-modifying treat-
ment that could signiﬁcantly improve outcomes in patients
with PA.
Conclusions
This work illustrates how a PK/PD model was used to
facilitate the quantitative translation of preclinical pharma-
cology data for an investigational mRNA therapeutic to the
clinic in support of selecting an efﬁcacious dose for ﬁrst-in-
human study. The application of such approaches is expected
to increase the rate of success in the clinic by ensuring the
