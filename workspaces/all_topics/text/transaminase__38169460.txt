through computational engineering of
stereochemical promiscuity to create an
amine racemase

Repurposing the intrinsic properties of natural enzymes can offer a viable
solution to current synthetic challenges through the development of novel
biocatalytic processes. Although aminoacid racemases are ubiquitous in living
organisms, an amine racemase (AR) has not yet been discovered despite its
synthetic potential for producing chiralamines. Here, we report the creation of
an AR based on the serendipitous discovery that amine transaminases (ATAs)
can perform stereoinversion of 2-aminobutane. Kinetic modeling revealed that
the unexpected off-pathway activity results from stereochemically pro-
miscuous futile cycles due to incomplete stereoselectivity for 2-aminobutane.
This ﬁnding motivated us to engineer anS-selective ATA through in silico
alanine scanning and empirical combinatorial mutations, creating an AR with
broad substrate speciﬁcity. The resulting AR, carrying double point mutations,
enables the racemization of both enantiomers of diverse chiral amines in the
presence of a cognate ketone. This strategy may be generally applicable to a
wide range of transaminases, paving the way for the development of new-to-
nature racemases.
Chirality of organic compounds is a universal chemical code that
underlies the biomolecular basis of living organisms1. Chiral symmetry
breaking has been established in the construction of biosynthetic
networks after the emergence of life by adopting a speciﬁcs t e r e o -
preference for biological building blocks, e.g.
L-amino acids for pro-
teins andD-sugars for nucleic acids2,3. However, living organisms have
also found a way to enrich metabolic and physiological diversity by
allocating biochemical tasks to the non-preferred enantiomers that are
readily available from the major chiral pool through stereoinversion
4.
For example, serine racemase suppliesD-serine to mammalian brains
as a signaling molecule5,6. This may explain why living organisms have
evolved the enzymes specialized for racemizing certain chiral com-
pounds, includingα-amino acids andα-hydroxy acids7.
The biological signiﬁcance of chirality becomes crucial when
ligand binding is controlled in a stereospeciﬁc way to target receptor
proteins that are homochiral underL-conﬁguration4,8.I nf a c t ,t h e
chirality of small-molecule pharmaceuticals plays a pivotal role in
exhibiting desirable therapeutic efﬁcacy, and therefore the chiral
antipode of the effective enantiomer often causes serious side effects,
as seen with Thalidomide
9. Consequently, it is essential for the phar-
maceutical industry to develop synthetic methods affording facile
preparation of enantiopure chiral drugs
9.
Among the chiral building blocks present in active pharma-
ceutical ingredients, chiral amines constitute one of the essential
stereogenic motifs and are found in approximately 40% of ther-
apeutic drugs, including sertraline (Zoloft, depression), sitagliptin

( Januvia, type 2 diabetes), rivastigmine (Exelon, Alzheimer’sd i s -
ease), tadala ﬁl (Cialis, erectile dysfunction), and oseltamivir
(Tamiﬂu, inﬂuenza)10–12. In addition, chiral amines are widely used
for agrochemical synthesis10. As a result, extensive studies have
been conducted on chemocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of
chiral amines using organocatalysts and transition-metal catalysts
via reductive amination of ketones or hydrogenation of imines and
enamines
11–13. It is also notable that traditional resolution methods
through diastereomeric crystallization are still widely used despite
a 50% yield limit
14. However, growing social demands for sustainable
and green processes have prioritized the development of biocata-
lytic methods
10.
Depending on the substrate type and the desired product
outcome, the biocatalytic strategies available for chiral amine pro-
duction are classi ﬁed into kinetic resolution (KR), asymmetric
synthesis, and deracemization, which exploit lipase, amine transa-
minase (ATA), monoamine oxidase, imine reductase, amine dehy-
drogenase, and reductive aminase
15. Lipase is the only enzyme that
does not act on the stereogenic C-N bond of the amine substrates
and thus permits only KR
16. However, despite the 50% yield penalty
of KR, the lipase process is the most robust technology owing to its
reliable scalability
16,17. The yield limit problem of KR can be over-
come by coupling in situ amine racemization with the enzymatic
resolution, which has been the focus of extensive research
efforts
16,18–21. However, amines are rather recalcitrant to chemical
racemization22,23, and thus the resulting harsh reaction conditions
are largely incompatible with biocatalysis16,19,24,25.A sar e s u l t ,t h e
current lipase process relies on racemization and recycling of the
unwanted amine leftover after KR
16.
An amine racemase (AR) would provide an ideal solution to
address the biocompatibility issues associated with the chemical
racemization. However, to date, such an enzyme, either natural or
engineered, has not yet been reported
26. Motivated by the potential
utility of AR, we hypothesized that creating an AR might be possible
by rerouting a native reaction pathway of ATAs, also known asω-
transaminases, as most racemases are evolutionarily and catalyti-
cally related to transaminases
27. We serendipitously discovered that
racemization of 2-aminobutane commenced at near equilibrium of
ATA reactions, which piqued our interest in exploring the feasibility
of creating an AR by engineering ATAs. In this study, we report on
the computational active-site remodeling of an ATA to confer ste-
reochemical promiscuity and demonstrate the racemization of both
enantiomers of structurally diverse chiral amines using the
engineered ATA.
Results and discussion
Theoretical feasibility of AR by engineering natural enzymes
To explore a plausible strategy for creating an AR, we compared two
catalytically related enzymes: amino acid racemase (AAR) and ATA,
both of which are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent (Fig.1a)
27.
AAR displays the desired reaction speciﬁcity, i.e. stereoinversion of Cα
chirality, but does not accept amine substrates. On the other hand,
ATA exhibits the matching substrate speciﬁcity but catalyzes a differ-
ent reaction. Both enzymes share an initial reaction pathway leading to
a carbanionic intermediate, and the ensuing steps bifurcate depending
on the electron sink capacity of PLP (Fig.1b)
28. Unlike AAR, the pro-
tonated PLP of ATA enables negative charge delocalization and thus
promotes protonation at C4′ of the carbanionic intermediate stabi-
lized by a quinonoid structure (Supplementary Fig. 1)
28.
Based on mechanistic considerations, engineering of AAR to AR
seems more feasible because it requires modiﬁcation of only the
substrate bias. However, the carboxylate group of amino acid sub-
strates has been suggested to play a crucial role in the proton relay
between catalytic bases of AAR
29. This led us to discard the AAR
strategy because an alternative proton transfer would be difﬁcult to
realize. On the other hand, engineering of ATA also poses challenges
because it requires extensive mutations to shunt the canonical ATA
pathway leading to the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate form of enzyme (E-
PMP), including adjusted electron sink capacity, complementary cat-
alytic bases, and stereochemical promiscuity.
Discovery of AR activity from native ATAs
We serendipitously discovered a clue to the engineering strategy
when we found that theS-selective ATA fromOchrobactrum anthropi
(ATA-OA)
30 converted S-2-aminobutane (S-D2) to the chiral antipode.
We carried out transamination between equimolarS-α-methylbenzy-
lamine (S-D1) and 2-butanone (A2), and monitored the generation of
S-D2 by chiral HPLC over a prolonged reaction time (Fig.2a). Sur-
prisingly, we found that S-D2 produced by ATA-OA underwent a
gradual reduction after 3 h, whereasR-D2 was built up by the same
amount of theS-D2 decrement, with the totalD2 kept constant. This
led to a continuous decrease in the enantiomeric excess (ee)o fS-D2
from >99% at 0.5 h to 62% at 24 h. We also examined the reverse
reaction and observed the stereoinversion ofS-D2 again after reach-
ing equilibrium (Fig.2b), ending up with 58%eeS at 24 h. In contrast,
stereoinversion ofS-D1 was not observed in both reactions (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2).
To investigate whether the stereoinversion was independent of
the cosubstrate, we tested seven additional amino donors (D3-D9)f o r

reductive amination ofA2 (Fig. 2c). All the reactions resulted in pro-
gressive decreases ineeS of D2 (Supplementary Fig. 3), leading to less
than 30% eeS after 3 days. Even near-racemic outcomes ofD2 were
attained withD3, D5,a n dD7-D9. It should be noted that the equili-
brium position is dependent on the amino donor, resulting in different
total D2 concentrations.
The stereoinversion ofS-D2, but notS-D1, suggests that the off-
pathway activity results from incomplete stereoselectivity forD2.
All ATAs are known to be strictly stereoselective for chiral amines
and catalyze reductive amination of prochiral ketones with >99%ee,
explained by a two-binding-site model consisting of a large (L) and a
small (S) pocket (Fig. 2d)
31. The S pocket has been proposed to
accommodate up to an ethyl group, which is a crucial determinant
for the stereospeciﬁc substrate recognition
31. For example, pro-
ductive binding ofR-D1 to S-selective ATAs is forbidden due to a
steric clash of the phenyl group in the S pocket. Nevertheless, as we
observed previously32, the active-site model does not rule out the
possibility that ATA-OA can marginally acceptR-D2 because both
Cα-ﬂanking substituents are no larger than an ethyl group. Con-
sistent with this,S-3-methyl-2-butylamine did not show the stereo-
inversion due to an isopropyl substituent (Supplementary Fig. 4).
However, the incomplete stereoselectivity for D2 alone cannot
explain the gradual changes in the chiral composition, because the
stereoselectivity should remain constant regardless of the reaction
progress.
Kinetic dissection of ATA-OA
We conducted kinetic analysis of ATA-OA with each enantiomer ofD1
and D2 to investigate the stereochemical properties (Fig.2e). ATAs
mediate two half reactions, namely oxidative deamination (OD) of an
amino donor (D) and reductive amination (RA) of an acceptor (A), by
shuttling between E-PLP and E-PMP
33. Taking into account the reaction
reversibility and substrate chirality, we examined four elemental
reactions denoted by I
S,I R,I IS,a n dI IR where I and II representD1-A1 and
D2-A2 pairs, respectively. Note that going back and forth within each
elemental reaction results in a futile cycle involving no overall change.
A complete reaction can be expressed by coupling two elemental
reactions. For example,S-D1 + A2 ↔A1 + S-D2 is denoted by I
S/IIS which
represents IS coupled with the reverse of IIS.
Instead of using complicated nonlinear kinetics, we approximated
that the OD and RA reactions follow second-order kinetics. For
e x a m p l e ,t h er e a c t i o nr a t e(v)f o rI
S
OD is kOD;Is [S-D1][E-PLP]. The strict
S-selectivity forD1 is manifested by the absence of generation ofA1
from R-D1 and vice versa, leading tokOD;IR ≈ 0a n dkRA;IR ≈ 0. It is worth
noting that aS-D1 impurity in the commercially availableR-D1 stock
(determined to be 99.1%eeR) initially resulted in generation ofA1
during OD ofR-D1,b u tt h e nA1 plateaued at the same concentration as
the S-D1 impurity (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, the incomple-
te stereoselectivity forD2 enabled us to measure bothkOD;IIR and
kRA;IIR , and we could determine the enantiomeric ratio (i.e.,ES deﬁned
as kS/kR)34 to be 20 for both OD and RA. The result ofES
OD = ES
RA indi-
cates that ATA-OA achieves the same stereocontrol over either direc-
tion of the reaction pathway.
The equilibrium constant (K
eq) of the elemental reactions can be
determined by Keq = kOD/kRA because vOD = vRA at equilibrium. The
similar values ofKeq;IIs and Keq;IIR in Fig. 2e are consistent with the
notion that chemical equilibrium is irrespective of chirality. To verify
this, we analyzed distribution changes in the enzyme intermediates
upon exposure to each enantiomer ofD2 using spectral analysis
(Fig.2f). Incubation of the E-PLP form of ATA-OA with eitherS-D2 or R-
D2 resulted in decreases in band 1, centered at 408 nm, and con-
comitant increases in band 2 corresponding to E-PMP
(λ
max = 339 nm)35. The spectral change induced byS-D2 was faster
than that by R-D2, consistent with kOD;IIs > kOD;IIR .B o t hs a m p l e s
reached equilibrium within 10 min as no further changes were detec-
ted. The identical spectra of ATA-OA equilibrated withS-D2 and R-D2
clearly indicate that population distributions of E-PLP and E-PMP are
the same irrespective of theD2 chirality, corroboratingK
eq;IIs = KOD;IIR .
Computational simulations of the stereoinversion
To understand how ATA-OA achieves racemization ofS-D2 even with
E S =2 0c o m p a r e dt oE ≈ 1 of AARs, we carried out kinetic modeling of
t h er e a c t i o ni nF i g .2a by considering IS,I IS,a n dI IR. The simulation was
initially carried out under suppressed futile cycle conditions by
excluding v
Is ,RA, vIIs ,OD,a n dvIIR ,OD, leading to a constanteeS of D2
throughout the reaction (Fig.3a). This result had been thought to be an
expected product outcome from stereochemically incomplete ATA
reactions until we discovered the stereoinversion phenomenon.

reaction proﬁles resembled the experimental results and the predicted
eeS was in reasonable agreement with the actual measurements
(Fig. 3b). The simulation shows thatS-D2 begins to decrease at 3.8 h
and complete racemization (i.e., eeS < 1%) occurs at 188 h (inset
of Fig.3b).
To better understand how the stereoinversion proceeds, we
compare vOD and vRA of IS,I IS,a n dI IR (Fig. 3c). IS

initially overwhelm the respective reverse reactions, and thenvOD and
vRA become closer to each other toward equilibrium. To trace how fast
the three elemental reactions approach equilibrium, net reaction rates
(i.e., v = v
OD – vRA) are visualized in inset of Fig.3c. As expected, IS
approaches equilibrium (i.e.,v = 0) most rapidly, seemingly because
kOD;Is is much higher thankRA;IIs and kRA;IIR . In contrast, IIS cannot
approach equilibrium alone due to the chemical perturbation caused
by the far-from-equilibrium state of IIR which is occurring most slowly.
As IIR consumesA2 under vIIR ,OD < vIIR ,RA,I IS keeps adjustingvIIs ,OD and
vIIs ,RA to compensate for the equilibrium perturbation. Eventually,vIIs
changes the sign at 3.8 h and IIS begins to convertS-D2 into A2 to fuel
vRA;IIR . Hence, stereoinversion via IIS/IIR,i . e .S-D2 ↔R-D2,b e g i n sa t3 . 8h
and proceeds untilS-D2 = R-D2 to meetkeq;IIs =IIR =1 .
Direct racemization of D2 by coupling IIS and IIR
As shown in Fig.2b, the stereoinversion ofS-D2 in the presence of a
non-cognate acceptor cannot lead to 100% yield ofrac-D2.W ep o s i t e d
that racemization ofD2 without the yield loss could be implemented
by running only IIS and IIR in the presence ofA2. Indeed, in agreement
with the model prediction, both enantiomers ofD2 underwent desired
racemization without concentration changes in totalD2 (Fig.3d). Note
that coupling IIS and IIR represents a futile cycle involving changes in
chiral composition only. Intriguingly, the racemization ofS-D2 (top
panel in Fig.3d, IIS/IIR) was slower than that ofR-D2 (bottom panel, IIR/
IIS) despite theS-preference of ATA-OA. This can be explained by the
rate-determining step (RDS) of IIS/IIR being slower than that of IIR/IIS
(Fig. 2e). TheS-to-R inversion proceeds via IIS
OD and IIR
RA, and thus is
limited by IIR
RA becausekOD;IIs » kRA;IIR .H o w e v e r ,t h eR-to-S inversion is
similarly limited by IIR
OD and IIS
RA as kOD;IIR and kRA;IIs are not very
different. Therefore,kRA;IIR much lower than bothkOD;IIR and kRA;IIs
explains vIIR =IIS > vIIS=IIR .
To corroborate the RDS analysis, initial rates of IIS/IIR and IIR/
IIS were measured at varying substrate concentrations (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). Indeed, vIIS=IIR was independent of S-D2 but
showed a positive correlation with A2,w h e r e a svIIR=IIS was
dependent on both R-D2 and A2. Likewise, an increase in A2
promotes racemization of both S-D2 and R-D2 with IIR/IIS being
faster than IIS/IIR at the sameA2 level (Fig. 3e). This result led us
to examine whether DMSO might augment the racemization
reaction because RA of ketones by ATAs is known to be enhanced
by DMSO
36. Indeed, 15% (v/v) DMSO turned out to promote the
racemization of both S-D2 and R-D2 (Supplementary Fig. 7).
To examine whether the racemization ofD2 is generally occurring
among ATAs, we tested four additional enzymes, i.e. twoS-selective
(ATA-PD31 and ATA-CV37)a n dt w oR-selective (ATA-AR38 and ATA-AF39)
ATAs cloned fromParacoccus denitriﬁcans, Chromobacterium viola-
ceum, Arthrobactersp., andAspergillus fumigatus, respectively. Indeed,
all the ATAs exhibit AR activity for bothS-D2 and R-D2 with the race-
mization of a preferred enantiomer being slower than that of the chiral
antipode (Fig.3f).
In silico engineering of ATA-OA to acceptR-D1
The AR activity discovered with natural ATAs results from incomplete
stereoselectivity and thus can only be applied to a few amines with Cα-
ﬂanking substituents not larger than an ethyl group. Therefore, we set
out to engineer ATA-OA usingD1 as a model substrate to create a
generally applicable AR. We reasoned that racemization ofD1 by
coupling IS and IR is thermodynamically feasible owing tokeq;IS=IR =1 ,
but kinetically trapped due tokIR ≈ 0. To reprogram the latent futile
cycle, we opted to reduce the kinetic barrier of I R.N u m e r i c a l

simulations using a hypothetical ATA-OA with tunableES ranging from
1 to 1000 show that both IS/IR and IR/IS proceed faster at lowerES and
converge to an identical result atES = 1 (Supplementary Fig. 8).
In a previous study, we demonstrated computational engineering
of ATA-OA to improve activities for ketones by exploiting mechanistic
analysis of the nucleophilic attack trajectory (NAT)31.H e r ew ea p p l i e d
the NAT analysis to identify an active-site residue whose mutation
could allow productive binding ofR-D1 without hindering the native
binding ofS-D1. ATA-OA forms a homodimeric structure harboring
two active sites on the subunit interface (inset of Fig.4a). The residue
R417, colored red, serves as a conformational switch that shifts
between an outward structure to accept a bulky group and an inward
one to recognize a carboxylate group
31. The top docking pose ofS-D1,
ranked by binding energy, outlines the L and S pockets where the
phenyl and methyl groups are accommodated, respectively (Fig.4a).
The asterisks of F86*, F323*, and T324* indicate that the residues are
from the other subunit. The S pocket is located adjacent to PLP and is
end-capped by S119, V154, and F323. The amino group ofS-D1 forms
hydrogen bonds with the phenolic oxygen of PLP andπ orbitals of
Y151, seemingly increasing nucleophilicity of the substrate required for
the nucleophilic attack on C4′ of PLP (Fig.4b). The NAT length (i.e., Nα-
C4′) of 3.1 Å is similar to 3.0 Å found with the reactive acceptor, e.g.
benzaldehyde, in the previous study
31. The angular orientation of NAT
is represented by two characteristic angles (Fig.4c), namely a dihedral
angle (θDH) and a Bürgi-Dunitz angle (θBD), which are known to be
optimal at 90o and 105o, respectively40. The docking pose ofS-D1
shows θDH =7 8o and θBD =9 1o, close to the optimal orientations.
Another crucial aspect to consider is the orientation of Hα relative to
Nε of the catalytic lysine. After the nucleophilic attack, theε-amino
group of K287 released from the internal aldimine should be available
to Hα for proton abstraction which is known to be a RDS
41.T h i s
explains why R-D1 is completely non-reactive despite having a top
docking pose similar to that ofS-D1 (Fig. 4d). Indeed, the NAT length,
θDH,a n dθBD of R-D1 are 3.1 Å, 70o,a n d7 9o, respectively. However, the
spatial positioning assumes the relative orientation of Hα of R-D1
opposite to that ofS-D1. Therefore, the Hα of R-D1 points away from
Nε, making it inaccessible for proton abstraction. We inspected all the
R-D1 docking poses, but none of them showed theS-D1-like position-
ing of both Nα and Hα (Supplementary Fig. 9).
We also conducted docking simulations withS-D2 and R-D2 to
investigate whether the NAT analysis could explain the incomplete
stereoselectivity forD2. Among the docking poses ofS-D2,t h ef o u r t h
one assumes desirable positioning of Nα and Hα (Fig. 4e), whereas the
top three poses show limited accessibility of Hα to Nε.R e g a r d i n gR-D2,
the sixth pose allows productive binding where the ethyl and methyl
substituents are accommodated in a reverse manner by the S and L
pockets, respectively (Fig.4f).
Taken together, we posit that productive binding ofR-D1 may
occur if the S pocket is excavated large enough to accept a phenyl
group. To explore this possibility, we performed in silico alanine
substitution of the nine active-site residues shown in Fig.4a, except for
S119, A230, and R417, and then carried out docking simulations withR-
D1. Note that the residues surrounding the methyl group ofS-D1 are
Y20, L57, F86*, Y151, and T324*. Docking simulations predict that only
the F86*A mutation allows for productive binding ofR-D1 (8th pose),
considering spatial positioning of Nα and Hα (Fig. 4g). Truncation of
the phenyl group from F86* upon the alanine substitution creates an
enlarged S pocket with additional room indicated by a gray surface.
This enables the reverse binding ofR-D1,w i t ht h eLa n dSp o c k e t s
accommodating the methyl and phenyl groups ofR-D1,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,
similar to the binding ofR-D2 in the wild type. However, such a reverse
binding ofR-D1 was not found with the other eight mutants, despite

thorough inspection of all the docking poses. The binding pose ofS-D1
in the F86*A mutant is almost identical to that in the wild type, sug-
gesting that F86*A would not affect the native binding ofS-D1 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10).
To verify the model prediction, we carried out activity assays for
R-D1 with puriﬁed enzymes of all the nine mutants. Indeed, only the
F86*A mutant exhibited a detectable activity forR-D1 (Supplementary
Table 1). Thev
S/vR ratio was determined to be 16 (Fig.4h). However, the
F86*A mutation was found to eliminate most of the native activity,
resulting in only 4% residual activity for S-D1 compared to the
wild type.
Considering the undetectable activity of the wild-type enzyme
toward R-D1, the dramatic alteration in stereoselectivity induced by
F86*A indicates that the bulky aromatic side chain of F86* serves as a
structural gatekeeper against stereochemical promiscuity. To explore
whether this stereocontrol strategy is shared among ATAs, we con-
ducted a partial multiple sequence alignment of 14S-selective ATAs
whose X-ray structures have been determined (Supplementary
Table 2). Indeed, the F86* residue of ATA-OA is conserved and repre-
sented by aromatic amino acids, speciﬁcally eleven Phe, two Tyr, and
one Trp.
To verify whether the reduction in size of the gatekeeper residue
could lead to deteriorated stereocontrol in other ATAs, we measured
the stereoselectivity of an F85*A mutant of ATA-PD forD1 in compar-
ison with the parental enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 11). Unlike ATA-OA,
ATA-PD displayed a detectable basal activity forR-D1 and the resulting
v
S/vR ratio of the wild-type enzyme was determined to be 4100 ± 400.
As observed with ATA-OA/F86*A, the F85*A mutation introduced to
ATA-PD led to a drastic loss of stereocontrol forD1, representing a 15-
fold reduction inv
S/vR. Notably, the ATA-PD/F85*A mutant showed
signiﬁcantly reduced activity forS-D1, at only 9% residual activity,
similar to ATA-OA/F86*A.
In addition to ATA-OA and ATA-PD in this study, it was reported
elsewhere that ATA-CV underwent a remarkable reduction in stereo-
selectivity forD1 due to F88*A mutation, resulting in a change in theE
value from 150 to 7
42. In line with these results, Ao et al. recently
reported that a point mutation to leucine at the same position resulted
in ATA fromRuegeria sp. TM1040 exhibiting substantial activity for
R-D143.
Combinatorial mutations to restore native activity
The drastic loss of the native activity of ATA-OA caused by F86*A,
despite the intended stereochemical promiscuity, prompted us to
carry out a second round of enzyme engineering to restore the activity.
The active site of ATA-OA is mostly constructed by a single subunit and
is completed by recruiting a loop region of another subunit from F82*
to R89* (Fig.5a). Notably, F86* directly participates in the active site by
ﬁlling in the breach between L57 and Y20 (Fig.5b). Therefore, we
suspected that F86*A might be detrimental to the structural stability of
the active site. To verify this presumption, we tested F86*L forD1,
anticipating a milder structural perturbation and, consequently, a
lower loss of activity compared to what was observed with F86*A
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Indeed, the F86*L mutant showed only a 20%
reduction in native activity forS-D1. It is worth noting that F86*L allows
for substantial activity forR-D1,r e s u l t i n gi nv
S/vR = 91, reminiscent of
the Y87*L mutant of ATA fromRuegeria sp. TM104043.
In a previous study, four active-site residues, i.e. L57, W58, V154,
and I261, were identiﬁed as activity-improving spots upon alanine
substitution, and their combinatorial mutations were found to be
additive
44. Thus, we expected that incorporating a second alanine
substitution might offset the F86*A-induced structural perturbation.
Indeed, the additional mutation led to the desired activity recovery,
and W58A and V154A elicited remarkable activity improvements forS-
D1 by 48- and 14-folds, respectively, compared to the F86*A mutant
(Fig. 5c). We chose the F86*A/V154A mutant for further study because
of the undesirably highv
S/vR of the W58A/F86*A mutant. Notably,
stereochemical promiscuity of the F86*A mutant is reinforced by the
addition of V154A.
Kinetic study of the F86*A/V154A mutant, named AR-OA, reveals
similar E
S for IOD and IRA (Fig. 5d). Likewise,ES for IIOD and IIRA are
similar, as observed with ATA-OA. All the fourES values are not very
different from unity, reminiscent of AARs. It is also noteworthy that the
K
eq values for the chirally opposite reactions are in reasonable agree-
ment. The similarKeq values for IS and IR were veriﬁed by the spectral
population analysis of AR-OA equilibrated withS-D1 and R-D1 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13).
As expected, AR-OA is capable of catalyzing racemization ofS-D1
which is not observed at all with ATA-OA (Fig.5e). Supplementation of
the reaction mixture with 15% DMSO promoted the racemization ofS-
D1 (Fig. 5f), as observed with that ofD2 by ATA-OA (Supplementary
Fig. 7). AR-OA affords racemization ofS-D2 even faster than ATA-OA
does (Supplementary Fig. 14), seemingly owing to the 4.5-fold increase
in k
RA;IIR .
As shown in Fig.1b, racemization of amino acids by AARs pro-
ceeds through a direct proton transfer, shuttling between E-PLP and a
carbanionic intermediate. In contrast, racemization of amines by AR-
OA necessitates supplementation of a cognate ketone to iterate futile
cycles between E-PLP and E-PMP, although the formulation of the net
chemical equation cancels out the ketone term (e.g.,S-D1 ↔R-D1 for I
S/
IR). Therefore, the cognate ketone acts like a cocatalyst, and the reac-
tion rate should be affected by the ketone level. Indeed, as observed
with IIS/IIR and IIR/IIS by ATA-OA in Supplementary Fig. 6b, increasing
supplementation ofA1 expedited the racemization ofS-D1 by AR-OA
(Supplementary Fig. 15). However, a catalytic amount of the cognate
ketone can be generated in the absence of external supply upon
mixing only AR-OA and the amine substrate, as oxidative deamination
should rapidly proceed until reaching equilibrium of the correspond-
ing elemental reaction. We conjectured that this cosubstrate-free
racemization, mimicking the AAR reactions, should be theoretically
sound, and indeed, we observed that AR-OA enabled the racemization
of S-D1 without the external supply ofA1 (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Synthetic applications of AR-OA
To demonstrate the catalytic utility of AR-OA, we carried out the
racemization of both enantiomers of 14 chiral amines (10 mM), in the
presence of a sub-equimolar cognate ketone (0.5 eq.) and 300μMA R -
OA (Fig.6a). D5, D16,a n dD17 underwent racemization most rapidly,
leading to less than 5%ee after 1 day. It took 3 days forD2 and D14 to
reach <10%ee and 7 days forD1, D3, D6,a n dD18. D10-D13 and D15
showed slower racemization. These results demonstrate the broad
substrate speciﬁcity of AR-OA, although the ketone and enzyme levels
we used were substantially higher than what is ideal for practical
applications. However, we anticipate that further engineering of AR-
OA to increasev
RA for the cognate ketone would enable the use of a
reasonable enzyme dosage in conjunction with a catalytic amount of
the cognate ketone.
To verify the synthetic potential of AR-OA, we decided to carry
out a preparative-scale racemization of 100 mMS-D5 in the pre-
sence of a catalytic amount of a cognate ketone (i.e., 0.1 molar eq.).
Prior to the preparative-scale reaction, we examined how the race-
mization was affected by varying enzyme dosages (30–100 μM) with
100 mM S-D5 and 10 mM benzylacetone (A5), showing gradual
increases in the reaction rate as anticipated (Fig.6b). Considering
cost-efﬁcient enzyme use, we opted to use 45μM AR-OA, corre-
sponding to 4 U/mL, for the preparative-scale reaction. After char-
ging a reaction vessel with 224 mgS-D5, 22.2 mgA5, and 60 U AR-
OA, the reaction mixture was periodically sampled for chiral ana-
lysis ofD5 (Fig. 6c). Theee
S value reached 5.6% at 36 h and further
decreased to 3.3% after an additional 11-h reaction. The resulting
rac-D5 was subjected to product isolation. The puriﬁed rac-D5

(53 mg, 23.7% recovery yield,ee S = 3.4%) was structurally conﬁrmed
by 1HN M R ,13C NMR, and LC/MS (Supplementary Fig. 17).
Our results suggest that unleashing the stereochemical trap could
activate the dormant AR activity of ATAs for any substrates. As a proof
of concept, we tested the racemization of alanine using an ATA-OA
mutant that was previously constructed to lose the inherent carbox-
ylate recognition but to improve other native activities through R417A
and W58L substitutions
31. We reasoned that R417A in the L pocket
might marginally allow productive binding of D-alanine, whereas the
wild type exclusively accepts L-alanine. Indeed, the mutant displayed
racemase activity for both enantiomers of alanine (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 18).
In summary, this study has uncovered the innate racemase
activity of transaminases that is normally under a kinetic trap but
can be triggered upon stereochemical relaxation. This might pro-
vide insights into the presence of D-amino acids in vivo despite the
lack of a speciﬁc racemase, e.g. D-aspartate in mammalian brains at
nanomolar levels
45. Our results suggest that transaminases could
exhibit racemase activity through iterative futile cycles if enough
acceptor is available under certain physiological conditions indu-
cing the stereochemical relaxation. We also demonstrated that
stereoselectivity of ATA is amenable to computational engineering
and the loss-free racemization of diverse amines can be achieved
with a cognate ketone. To the best of our knowledge, this study
presents theﬁrst example of AR in which the synthetic potential is
manifested as the two-base mechanism of natural AARs is not
readily applicable to amines
29. We anticipate that AR-OA or
improved variants can offer greaterﬂexibility in the process design
for biocatalytic production of chiral amines. Furthermore, our
strategy might potentially be extended to a broad range of transa-
minases beyond ATAs.
Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis
Alanine scanning mutants of ATA-OA were previously constructed in a
pET28(+) vector
44. Four mutants, carrying double point mutations,
were constructed by a QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagen-
esis kit (Agilent Technologies) using the F86*A mutant as a template.
PCR primers used for the mutagenesis were the same as those used for
the alanine scanning mutations
44. The F86*L mutant of ATA-OA and the
F85*A mutant of ATA-PD were generated using the same mutagenesis
kit with PCR primers designed by the manufacturer’sp r i m e rd e s i g n
program. Sequences of the mutagenesis primers are provided in
Supplementary Table 3. The intended mutagenesis was veriﬁed by
DNA sequencing.
Preparation of puriﬁed enzymes
For protein expression, we used Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells
transformed with pET28a(+) vectors, harboring ATA-OA30, ATA-PD31,
ATA-CV31,A T A - A R46,a n dA T A - A F46 genes, as described elsewhere. Cell
cultivation and puriﬁcation of the His-tagged ATAs were performed as
described previously31. Detailed experimental procedures are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Methods. Molar concentrations of the
puriﬁed ATAs were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using
molar extinction coefﬁcients obtained athttp://www.biomol.net/en/
tools/proteinextinction.htm.
Enzyme activity assay
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all the enzyme assays to measure ATA
activity were carried out at 37 °C and pH 7 (50 mM potassium phos-
phate buffer) under initial rate measurement conditions (i.e., conver-
sion <20%). One unit of ATA is deﬁned as the enzyme amount required
to produce 1μmol ofA1 in 1 min at 10 mMS-D1 and 10 mM pyruvate.A1
produced was analyzed by HPLC. Microsoft Excel was used for ana-
lyzing enzyme activities.
Stereoinversion ofS-D2 by ATA-OA in the presence of a non-
cognate cosubstrate
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all reactions were carried out with 50 mM
amino donor, 50 mM acceptor, and 750μMA T A - O Aa t3 7° Ca n dp H7
(50 mM phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM PLP). Regarding
the reactions betweenA2 and D3-D9,6 5 0μMe n z y m ew a su s e da n d
the reaction mixture contained 15% (v/v) DMSO. Racemic forms ofD3-
D9,e x c e p tf o rD8 and D9, were used as the amino donor. At pre-
determined reaction times, the reaction samples were taken for chiral
HPLC analysis ofD2.

Kinetic analysis
To determine second-order rate constants, a pseudo-one-substrate
kinetic model used in a previous study30 was further simpliﬁed
under limiting conditions (see Supplementary Methods for details).
Brieﬂy, reaction conditions were set to meet the limiting conditions
where the concentrations of substrate and cosubstrate were lower
and higher, respectively, than the correspondingK
M values. The
resulting equation, i.e.k ≈ vi/([E][S]), was used to determinek with
three independent initial rate data ( vi)m e a s u r e da tﬁxed con-
centrations of enzyme (E) and substrate (S). Linear regression of the
product formation against time was used to determine thev
i values.
The cosubstrates used to determinekOD and kRA were pyruvate and
D8, respectively. Speciﬁc reaction conditions and products ana-
lyzed for the kinetic measurements are listed in Supplementary
Table 4. Initial rates for the kinetic analysis were determined at
<20% conversion. Kinetic analysis and preparation of charts were
carried out using Sigmaplot.
Spectral analysis
The E-PLP form of ATA-OA was prepared by incubation of the puriﬁed
enzyme with 10 mM pyruvate for 1 h at 24oC and then desalting on a
HiTrap column (GE healthcare) using a 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 7) supplemented with 75 mM NaCl. The resulting E-PLP (11
μM) was mixed with each enantiomer ofD2 (50 mM), followed by
incubation at 24
oC until the aliquot was sampled for spectral mea-
surement under a wavelength scanning mode of a UV-1650PC spec-
trophotometer (Shimadzu) using UVProbe 2.62. The scanning
performed immediately after the mixing was designated by 0.1-min
incubation.
Mathematical modeling of enzyme reactions
Numerical simulations of the ATA-OA reaction require mass balance
equations for related chemical species and enzyme intermediates
whose time derivatives can be expressed using a second-order kinetics
as described previously
47. Brieﬂy, simulations of the reaction between
S-D1 and A2 involve IS,I IS,a n dI IR, and thus should include balance
equations forS-D1, A1,S-D2, R-D2, A2,E - P L P ,a n dE - P M P .T h er e s u l t i n g
seven differential equations were numerically solved using Mathema-
tica 12 (Wolfram Research). Regarding the AR reaction betweenD2 and
A2,o n l yI I
S and IIR are included in the simulation using time derivatives
of S-D2,R-D2, A2, E-PLP, and E-PMP. Detailed experimental procedures
are presented in the Supplementary Methods.
Direct racemization of D2 with A2 by native ATAs
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all reactions were carried out with 50 mM
S-D2 or R-D2,5 0m MA2,a n d1 0 0μM ATA at 37 °C and pH 7 (50 mM
phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mM PLP). The reactions at varying
concentrations ofA2 were carried out at 10 mMS-D2 or R-D2,1 -2 0m M
A2,a n d5 0μM ATA-OA. Regarding ATAs other than ATA-OA, we used
100 μMe n z y m ef o rt h er e a c t i o n s .
Molecular modeling
Molecular modeling was performed with the Discovery Studio package
(version 4.5, Accelrys). Docking simulations require an E-PLP structure
harboring the active-site arginine in an outward conformation. How-
ever, the crystal structure of ATA-OA available (PDB ID: 5GHF) is an
E-PMP form assuming an inward R417
31. Therefore, we conducted
structural modiﬁcations of 5GHF to construct the desired structure by
recruiting the PLP and the arginine structures from ATA-CV and

ATA-PD, respectively, as described elsewhere44. The resulting structure
was further modiﬁed to a tautomeric structure of the internal aldimine
where the Nε and the phenolic oxygen were protonated and depro-
tonated, respectively, as shown in Fig.1b. Protonated forms ofD1 and
D2 were used as ligands for docking simulations on the CDOCKER
module under a default setting (2,000 steps at 700 K for a heating
step; 5000 steps at 300 K for a cooling step; 8 Å grid extension) within
t h ea c t i v es i t ed eﬁned by the Binding Site module. The alanine scan-
ning mutants of ATA-OA were generated by the Design Protein module
of the Discovery Studio package without additional energy
minimization.
Racemization of various chiral amines using AR-OA
All reactions were carried out with 10 mMS-o rR-amine, 5 mM cognate
ketone, and 300μM AR-OA at 37 °C and pH 7 (50 mM Tris buffer
containing 0.5 mM PLP). DMSO (15% (v/v)) was included in the reac-
tions withS-amines.R-D6 could not be tested due to the unavailability
of the chemical stock. Reaction mixtures were incubated in reaction
vials which were kept tightly sealed to avoid evaporation of ketone.
Aliquots of the reaction mixture were sampled after 1, 3, and 7 days,
and then subjected to chiral HPLC analysis of the amine substrates.
Preparative-scale racemization ofS-D5 and product isolation
Reaction conditions were 100 mMS-D5,1 0m MA5,a n d4 5μMA R - O Ai n
50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) supplemented with 0.5 mM PLP
(total reaction volume = 15 mL) at 37oC under magnetic stirring. For
product isolation, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.9
after a 47-h reaction by adding 5 N HCl solution (110μL), and the protein
precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 40 min).
The resulting supernatant was treated with two extractions of 40 mL
hexane each to removeA5. The pH of the ketone-free reaction mixture
was adjusted to 12 by adding 1.4 mL of 5 N NaOH solution, and the
deprotonatedD5w a se x t r a c t e dt h r e et i m e s ,e a c hw i t h4 0m Lo fh e x a n e .
The extractant pool was vacuum evaporated at 50 °C and 450 hPa,
resulting in liquidD5.T h ei s o l a t e dD5 was characterized by
1HN M R ,13C
NMR, and LC/MS.1Ha n d13C NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance
III HD 400 spectrometer (Bruker Co.). Mass spectral data were obtained
with a Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer connected to a
Dionex Ultimate 3000 Nano HPLC (Thermo Fisher ScientiﬁcI n c . ) .
HPLC analysis
HPLC analysis was performed using an Alliance system (Waters) or a
1260 Inﬁnity II LC System (Agilent Technologies).A1 was analyzed on a
Symmetry C18 column (Waters) using isocratic elution of 60/40/0.1%
(v/v) MeOH/water/triﬂuoroacetic acid at aﬂow rate of 1 mL/min under
UV detection tuned at 254 nm. Chiral analysis of alkylamines and ala-
nine was carried out after derivatization with a Marfey’sr e a g e n ta s
described previously
46. Detailed experimental procedures are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Methods. A Crownpak CR(-) column
(Daicel) was used for chiral analysis of arylalkylamines. HPLC data were
collected by EMPOWER Pro and OpenLAB for Waters and Agilent
HPLC, respectively. Detailed chiral analysis conditions are provided in
Supplementary Table 5.

tures and to combineﬁgures, respectively. Detailed descriptions of
