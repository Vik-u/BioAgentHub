Abstract
Temporal and spatial patterns of photosynthetic enzyme expression and structural maturation of chlorenchyma 
cells along longitudinal developmental gradients were characterized in young leaves of two single cell C 4 species, 
Bienertia sinuspersici  and Suaeda aralocaspica . Both species partition photosynthetic functions between distinct 
intracellular domains. In the C 4-C domain, C 4 acids are formed in the C 4 cycle during capture of atmospheric CO 2 
by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. In the C 4-D domain, CO 2 released in the C 4 cycle via mitochondrial NAD-
malic enzyme is refixed by Rubisco. Despite striking differences in origin and intracellular positioning of domains, 
these species show strong convergence in C 4 developmental patterns. Both progress through a gradual develop -
mental transition towards full C 4 photosynthesis, with an associated increase in levels of photosynthetic enzymes. 
Analysis of longitudinal sections showed undeveloped domains at the leaf base, with Rubisco rbcL mRNA and 
protein contained within all chloroplasts. The two domains were first distinguishable in chlorenchyma cells at the 
leaf mid-regions, but still contained structurally similar chloroplasts with equivalent amounts of rbcL mRNA and 
protein; while mitochondria had become confined to just one domain (proto-C 4-D). The C 4 state was fully formed 
towards the leaf tips, Rubisco transcripts and protein were compartmentalized specifically to structurally distinct 
chloroplasts in the C 4-D domains indicating selective regulation of Rubisco expression may occur by control of 
transcription or stability of rbcL mRNA. Determination of CO 2 compensation points showed young leaves were 
not functionally C 4, consistent with cytological observations of the developmental progression from C 3 default to 
intermediate to C 4 photosynthesis.

Introduction
Carbon gain through photosynthesis is limited in plants due 
to high levels of photorespiration, a metabolically wasteful 
process which is prominent in warm climates and under con-
ditions of reduced water availability. Some plant species have 
evolved the distinct CO 2 concentrating mechanism known 
as C 4 photosynthesis, which suppresses photorespiration. 
The C 4 pathway enhances the photosynthetic capacity of 
these plants relative to other plants that directly assimilate 
atmospheric CO2 via the C 3 pathway (Edwards and Walker, 
1983; Hatch, 1987). C4 photosynthesis has evolved indepen -
dently more than 60 times across a wide range of monocot 
and dicot species ( Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011; Sage 
et  al., 2011 ). An important requirement for C 4 function is 
spatial separation of two biochemical processes: the initial 
capture of atmospheric CO 2 during the carboxylation phase 
of the C 4 cycle occurs within one compartment (the car -
boxylation domain, C 4-C), while the decarboxylation phase 
donates CO 2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxy -
genase (Rubisco) within a second compartment (the decar -
boxylation domain, C 4-D). There are many structural and 
biochemical variations associated with anatomical develop -
ment and function of the two domains (Edwards and Walker, 
1983; Hatch, 1987; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011; Sage 
et  al., 2011 ). In its most common form, this separation is 
achieved by the dual-cell C 4 system called Kranz anatomy. 
The leaves of Kranz species possess two biochemically and 
anatomically distinct photosynthetic cell types: an inner layer 
called bundle sheath (BS) or Kranz cells, and an outer layer 
of palisade mesophyll (M) cells. In the leaves of Kranz C 4 
plants, the C4-C domain is specifically compartmentalized to 
the M cells, while the C 4-D domain is compartmentalized to 
BS cells (Edwards and Walker, 1983; Hatch, 1987; Kanai and 
Edwards, 1999).
Remarkably, a few terrestrial C 4 species that lack Kranz 
anatomy have been shown to function by development of 
C4-C and C4-D domains within different parts of individual 
chlorenchyma cells (Edwards et al., 2004; Freitag and Stichler, 
2000; Voznesenskaya et al., 2001, 2002 ; Akhani et al., 2005; 
Chuong et  al., 2006 ; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011 ). 
These unique species occur only in subfamily Suaedoideae 
(family Chenopodiaceae). Within this subfamily, independ -
ent evolutionary acquisition of C 4 photosynthesis is consid -
ered to have occurred four times. This includes two origins 
of single cell C 4 (SC-C4) with different forms of anatomy in 
genus Bienertia versus Suaeda aralocaspica (syn.=Borszczowia 
aralocaspica), as well as two separate origins of distinctive 
Kranz C4 anatomies between Suaeda sections Salsina sensu 
lato ( s.l.) versus Schoberia ( Schütze et  al., 2003 ; Kapralov 
et al., 2006). All four lineages utilize a mitochondrial NAD-
malic enzyme (NAD-ME) for the decarboxylation phase of 
the C4 cycle in the C4-D domain.
There are major structural differences between the two 
domains of S. aralocaspica and Bienertia species. In S. aralo-
caspica, biochemically dimorphic chloroplasts are partitioned 
between opposite ends of the elongated chlorenchyma cells; 
the distal end towards the exterior is the C 4-C domain, and 
the proximal end towards the interior of the leaf is the C 4-D 
domain. In contrast, in Bienertia species the dimorphic chlo-
roplasts are partitioned between the peripheral cytoplasm 
(the peripheral compartment, PC) that functions as the C4-C 
domain and a ball-like central cytoplasmic compartment 
(CCC) in the center of the cell that functions as the C 4-D 
domain, with the two compartments connected by cytoplas -
mic channels through the vacuole ( Voznesenskaya et  al., 
2001, 2002; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011).
In all forms of C 4 that have been studied to date, during 
leaf development a progression occurs in structural and bio -
chemical differentiation, which results in fully functional C 4 
photosynthesis. To understand the process of C 4 develop -
ment, it is essential to identify the regulatory processes and 
factors responsible for these transitional steps. Precise meth-
ods are needed for defining the sequence of these transitions 
and exactly where they occur in different types of C 4. In 
Kranz-type C4 species, this is being approached through anal-
yses of changes during development in mesophyll and bundle 
sheath cells along leaf longitudinal gradients to ultimately 
identify genetic components of C 4 form and function; for a 
review, see Covshoff et  al. (2014) . This includes studies in 
representatives from families Poaceae (maize and Arundinella 
hirta), Cyperaceae (three anatomical types), Amaranthaceae 
(Amaranthus hypochondriacus ), Chenopodiaceae ( Suaeda 
taxifolia, S.  eltonica ) and Cleomaceae ( Cleome angustifo -
lia, Gynandropsis gynandra ), which show some differences 
in development ( Langdale et  al., 1988 ; Wang et  al., 1992 ; 
Dengler et  al., 1995 ; Soros and Dengler, 2001 ; Wakayama 
et  al., 2003; Li et  al., 2010; Majeran et  al., 2010; Koteyeva 
et al., 2011, 2014; Nelson, 2011; Pick et al., 2011; Aubry et al., 
2014; Külahoglu et al., 2014).
In the current work, an analogous approach was used to 
analyze chlorenchyma development along longitudinal leaf 
gradients in two species, Bienertia sinuspersici  and Suaeda 
aralocaspica, which have independent evolutionary origins 
and anatomical forms of SC-C 4. Taken together, the inte -
grated structural, biochemical, and functional analyses 
presented here reveal a stepwise progression in the develop -
ment of C4 type chlorenchyma cells. This study provides new 
insights into processes responsible for the specialized photo -
synthetic characteristics of these unique plants. The findings 
highlight the dramatic differences in development of single-
cell C 4 compared to sister Kranz-type Suaeda species, and 
they suggest diversity exists in how regulatory factors control 
the evolution of different forms of C4.
Materials and methods
Plant material
The SC-C4 species Bienertia sinuspersici Akhani and Suaeda aralo-
caspica (Bunge) Freitag & Schütze (syn.= Borszczowia aralocaspica 
Bunge) were used in this study. These are classified as C 4 structural 
forms called Bienertioid and Borszczowoid, respectively ( Edwards 
and Voznesenskaya, 2011). Seeds of S. aralocaspica, originally col-
lected in Kazakhstan, were germinated on moist paper towels in 
Development of single cell C4 photosynthesis | 2589
Petri dishes for 1–2 d at 22°C. After the radical appeared, seeds were 
transferred to a soil mixture of one part potting soil, two parts sand, 
0.25 part gypsum, 0.5 part Perlite, and 0.5 part clay. B. sinuspersici 
Akhani (seeds originally from Kuwait) was propagated from cut -
tings in rooting MS media and transferred to potting soil according 
to the protocol of Smith et al. (2009).
Plants were grown in a growth chamber (model GC-16; Enconair 
Ecological Chambers Inc., Winnipeg, Canada) under a 14/10  h 
25/18°C day/night cycle under mid-day PPFD of ~400 μmol quanta 
m–2 s–1, and 50% relative humidity for ~2 months. Plants were fer -
tilized once a week with Peter’s Professional (20:20:20; Scotts 
Miracle-Gro Co., Marysville, OH, USA) and watered once a week 
with 150 mM NaCl.
For microscopy and biochemical analyses, leaf samples were 
taken from vegetative branches on ~2  month old plants. Mature 
leaves of B. sinuspersici are 2.5–3  cm in length, and S. aralocaspica 
1.5–2 cm in length; for studies on transitions along a longitudinal 
gradient young leaves 0.5–0.7 cm long were used (see Supplementary 
Fig. S1, available at JXB online, for a general view of mature and 
young leaves).

(E. Voznesenskaya 85), May 2013, WS386421.
Light and electron microscopy
Developmental studies were carried out on young expanding leaves 
and on mature leaves that were fully expanded. For structural stud-
ies, for each developmental stage sampled, three replicates were taken 
from three independent plants for each species (i.e. a total of nine 
samples for each species). Vegetative shoot apices with several leaf 
primordia (up to 0.3  cm), and young leaves (0.5–0.7  cm in length), 
were harvested and prepared for longitudinal and cross sectioning.
Sample preparation for light microscopy (LM) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out according to Koteyeva 
et  al. (2011). An Olympus BH-2 (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd) light 
microscope equipped with LM Digital Camera and Software 
(Jenoptik ProgRes Camera, C12plus, Jena, Germany) was used for 
observation and collection of images on LM level. Hitachi H-600 
(Hitachi Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), and FEI Tecnai 
G2 (Field Emission Instruments Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) 
equipped with Eagle FP 5271/82 4K HR200KV digital camera 
transmission electron microscopes were used for TEM studies.
Observations and image capture of vegetative shoot apices with 
the youngest primordia were obtained by scanning electron micros-
copy, using the low vacuum mode on an FEI SEM Quanta 200F 
(FEI Company, Field Emission Instruments, Hillsboro, OR, USA).
Observations of vascular development were obtained from 
leaves of different ages, from the youngest primordia (starting from 
~0.3 mm long) to fully expanded leaves (2.5–3  cm for B. sinuspersici 
and 1.5–2  cm for S.  aralocaspica). These samples were cleared in 
70% ethanol (v/v) until chlorophyll was removed, treated with 5% 
(w/v) NaOH overnight, and then rinsed three times in water. At 
least five vegetative shoot tips with different-aged leaves from two or 
three different plants were used. The leaves were mounted in water 
and examined under UV light (with DAPI filter) on a Fluorescence 
Microscope Leica DMFSA (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar GmbH, 
Germany) using autofluorescence of lignified tracheary elements of 
the xylem.
In situ immunolocalization
Sample preparation and immunolocalization by LM and TEM 
was carried out on longitudinal sections of leaves 0.5–0.7  cm long 
according to the procedures in Koteyeva et  al. (2011). Antibodies 
used (all polyclonal raised in rabbit) were anti-spinach Rubisco 
(rbcL) IgG (courtesy of B.  McFadden), and commercially avail -
able anti-maize PEPC IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The 
density of labeling was determined by counting the gold particles 
on digital electron micrographs using the UTHSCSA image analysis 
program and calculating the number per unit area (μm2). Additional 
details are available in Supplementary Methods S1 available at JXB 
online.
In situ localization of mRNAs encoding Rubisco large subunit 
protein
Sample preparation and in situ  hybridization was carried out on 
longitudinal sections of leaves 0.5–0.7  cm long according to the 
procedures in Koteyeva et  al. (2011) . Sense and antisense RNA 
probes for Rubisco rbcL were generated from pBlsl (which contains 
a 600-bp HindIII fragment from the central coding region of the 
amaranth rbcL gene) using a modification of procedures described 
in Wang et al. (1992). Sense and antisense transcripts were synthe -
sized and labeled in vitro  with Biotin-11-UTP (Roche) using T7 
or T3 polymerase (Roche). Samples of young leaves were fixed in 
FAA (50% ethanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, 10% formalin) fixative 
at room temperature overnight. After ethanol and t-Butyl alcohol 
dehydration, samples were embedded in Paraplast Plus. The paraf -
fin-embedded samples were sectioned (thickness 5–10  µm) using a 
rotary microtome; sections were mounted to poly-L-lysine-coated 
slides, dried, and stored at 4°C overnight. After deparaffinization by 
xylene, the sections were rehydrated through an ethanol series, incu-
bated in 0.2 M HCl for 20 min at room temperature (RT), and rinsed 
in H 2O. Slides were then incubated in 2×SSC (1×SSC is 0.15  M 
NaCl, 0.15 M sodium citrate) at 70°C for 30 min and rinsed by H2O. 
Treatment of sections with proteinase K (1  µg ml−1 in TE: 100  mM 
TRIS pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA) for 15 min at 37°C was followed by a 
brief rinse in PBS (10  mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM 
NaCl, pH 7.4), blocking in glycine (2  mg ml–1 in PBS) for 2  min at 
RT, and then by fixation for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde. The sections 
were incubated in 2×SSC for 10  min at RT, and then placed into 
prehybridization medium [containing 1.25× in situ salts (10× salts: 
3 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M NaHPO4, 50mM EDTA, pH 6.8), 50% 
deionized formamide, 1 mg ml−1 tRNA, 125 mM DTT, 0.5 mg ml−1 
polyA] overnight at 50°C. The probes were first heated at 75°C for 
30 s and mixed with prehybridization medium with a final transcript 
concentration of 0.5 µg ml–1. Hybridizations with the Biotin-labelled 
transcripts were performed at 50°C overnight in a moist incubation 
chamber. The slides were then subjected to the following series of 
washes: prewarmed at 37°C in 2×SSC for 10  min; 2×SSC for 1  h at 
RT; 1×SSC for 1 h at RT; 0.5×SSC for 30 min at 42°C; 0.5×SSC for 
30 min at RT. Hybridized transcripts were detected by streptavidin–
alkaline phosphate conjugate (NeutrAvidin; Pierce) using block -
ing buffer (100  mM TRIS–HCl, pH 7.5, 150  mM NaCl). The final 
detection step was carried out by nitroblue tetrazolium chloride 
and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). Reactions were 
stopped by placing slides in 1×PBS and the sections were mounted 
in 50% glycerol in PBS. Observations and image capture were per -
formed using an Olympus BH-2 light microscope equipped with LM 
Digital Camera and Software.
Western blot analysis
Analyses were made to determine accumulation of photosynthetic 
enzymes in samples of young leaves 0.5–0.7  cm long divided into 
three sections (base, middle and tip) compared to mature leaves. 
Western blots were performed using anti- Amaranthus hypochon -
driacus NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) IgG against the 65 KDa 
α subunit ( Long and Berry, 1996 ) (1:5000), anti- Zea mays  PEPC 
IgG (1:100 000), anti- Zea mays pyruvate,Pi dikinase (PPDK) IgG 
(courtesy of T.  Sugiyama) (1:5000), anti- Amaranthus hypochon -
driacus Rubisco SSU IgG (courtesy of J. Berry) (1:5000); or anti-  
Spinacia oleracea  Rubisco rbcL IgG (courtesy of B.  McFadden) 
(1:10 000) overnight at 4°C. For details see Supplementary Methods 
S1, and Supplementary Fig. S2  for a loading control with protein 
samples (10 µg) separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE.

Mass spectrometric measurements
A membrane inlet mass spectrometer (DELTA V Plus; Thermo 
Scientific) connected to a closed leaf chamber via a membrane 
inlet was used to measure rates of isotopic CO 2 exchange and 
CO2 compensation points ( Γ), as described previously ( Maxwell 
et  al., 1998 ; Walker and Cousins, 2013 ). Leaves were detached 
from different branches and placed into the chamber at ambient 
CO2 and O 2 partial pressures ( Supplementary Fig. S1C–F ). For 
analysis with B. sinuspersici , 3–4 mature leaves or 16–18 young 
leaves (length ~0.5  cm) were used; for analysis with S.  aralo-
caspica , 5–8 mature leaves or 30–40 young leaves (length ~0.6  cm) 
were used. The leaf chamber was flushed with mixture of nitro -
gen and corresponding oxygen partial pressure and then sealed. 
After sitting for 5  min in the dark, the leaves were illuminated 
with 1000  µmol quanta m –2 s –1, with a chamber temperature of 
25°C controlled by a circulating water bath. Net CO 2 assimilation 
was followed in the sealed chamber by measuring the change in 
CO2 concentration until the Γ was reached (i.e. when the amount 
of CO 2 assimilated by photosynthesis was balanced with the 
amount of CO 2 released by respiration and photorespiration, Г 
was recorded). The response of Γ to changes in O 2 was measured 
at 10%, 20% and 40% (at partial pressures of 0.092, 0.184 and 
0.369 mbar O 2, respectively). The rate of dark respiration was 
calculated by measuring the amount of CO 2 release in the dark. 
The zero set point was recorded, before and after each measure, 
by flushing the chamber with a corresponding CO 2-free nitrogen 
and O2 mixture.
Statistical analysis
Where indicated, standard errors were determined, and analysis 
of variance (ANOV A) was performed with Statistica 7.0 software 
(StatSoft, Inc.). Tukey’s HSD (honest significant difference) test 
were used to analyze differences between amounts of gold particles, 
intensities of bands in western blots and Г and dark respiration val-
ues at different stages of leaf development. All analyses were per -
formed at the 95% significance level.
Results
Structure of shoot apex and early leaf development
Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used 
to examine the morphology and anatomy of vegetative apical 
shoot meristems during active organogenesis of B. sinusper-
sici and S. aralocaspica in order to show the earliest stages of 
leaf initiation (Supplementary Fig. S2). The vegetative apices 
(apical meristems) of both species are very similar in shape 
and composition ( Supplementary Fig. S2A–C, E, F ). Leaf 
primordia are initiated alternately in both species forming the 
buds with more or less loosely packed leaves in B. sinuspersici 
and tightly packed leaves in S. aralocaspica (Supplementary 
Fig. S3  illustrates differences in branches and in leaf mor -
phology of young versus mature leaves of the two species).
Observations on longitudinal sections of the youngest 
leaves (length 0.1–0.3  mm) showed differences in the origin 
of chlorenchyma cells from the ground meristem. Periclinal 
divisions of subepidermal cells give rise to two layers of 
chlorenchyma in B. sinuspersici, versus a hypodermal and a 
chlorenchyma layer in S. aralocaspica (not shown).
The development of vascular tissue was studied in young, 
cleared leaves of different lengths. The analysis showed that 
the central vein was formed acropetally from the base to tip 
in both species, beginning in leaves that were ~0.5 mm long (a 
forming vein in B. sinuspersici is illustrated in Fig. 1A with an 
arrow). Peripheral veins were developed basipetally in both 
species (indicated by the label in Fig. 1B), starting from the 
tip of 0.7–1 mm leaves with descending interconnecting loops 
(Fig. 1A, C). This was followed by dense reticulation that pro-
gressed along with continuing leaf growth (Fig. 1B, D).

There is acropetal formation of the central vein towards the leaf tip (illustrated by arrow in panel A) and basipetal direction of lateral vascular vein 
development from the tip to base of the leaf (illustrated by arrows in panel B). Scale bars: 250 μm for A, B; 500 μm for C, D.

Chlorenchyma developmental gradient along the leaf: 
light and transmission electron microscopy
The structural differentiation of chlorenchyma cells was 
examined using longitudinal sections of young leaves (0.5–
0.7 cm long) that possess a basipetal developmental gradi -
ent with fully differentiated tissues at the tip ( Fig. 2). Clear 
differences were observed in chlorenchyma cell differentia -
tion between the tip and the base of leaves with a gradual 
developmental transition in structural specialization that was 
coupled with cell expansion. For comparison of the results 
the developmental progression was divided into four stages, 
with numbering 1 through 4 beginning at the basal region and 
towards the tip of the leaves (Fig. 2A–D and E–I for B. sinus-
persici, J–M and N–R for S. aralocaspica).
The chlorenchyma cells near the leaf base (Stage 1) were 
found to be small and uniform. These cells undergo periclinal 
and anticlinal divisions in B.  sinuspersici ( Fig.  2A, E), and 
only anticlinal division in S.  aralocaspica ( Fig.  2J, N). The 
peripheral vascular tissues are immature at the leaf base, con-
sisting of xylem elements in the process of differentiation, 
and undifferentiated phloem elements (not shown).
In B. sinuspersici, Stage 1 (at the leaf base) chlorenchyma 
cells have a dense cytoplasm, a centrally located large nucleus, 
and multiple small vacuoles. There are a few small chloro -
plasts, which are distributed throughout the cytoplasm 
(Fig. 2E). SC-C4 development initiates at Stage 2 (above the 
base towards the mid-section), where differentiation of the 
unique chlorenchyma cell morphology is first observed. At 
this stage, there is development of vacuoles at opposite poles 
of the cell, while chloroplasts and mitochondria continue to 
multiply and begin to aggregate at the center of the cell next 
to the nucleus, which is pressed against one side of the cell 
(Fig. 2F). In Stage 3 (mid-section of the leaf towards the tip, 
Fig. 2. Light and electron microscopy of Bienertia sinuspersici (A–I) and Suaeda aralocaspica (J–R) with longitudinal sections of young leaves. The 
sections show a basipetal developmental gradient with gradual structural differentiation of SC-C4 chlorenchyma cells with four stages along the 
longitudinal gradient: Stage 1 (A, E, J, N), Stage 2 (B, F, K, O), Stage 3 (C, G, L, P) and Stage 4 (D, H, I, M, Q, R). Panels A–D from B. sinuspersici 
and J–M from S. aralocaspica are light microscopy micrographs of longitudinal sections showing the development of chlorenchyma cell lineages 
from the base (A, J) to the tip (D, M) of young leaves, with the direction of maturation from left to right. Panels E–G from B. sinuspersici and N–P from 
S. aralocaspica, are TEM micrographs showing internal structural development within a single chlorenchyma cell along the longitudinal gradient from 
the base (E, N) to the middle region (G, P) of a young leaf. Panels H, I, show the ultrastructure of chloroplasts in the central cytoplasmic compartment, 
CCC (panel H) and the periphery (panel I) within a single chlorenchyma cell at the tip of a young B. sinuspersici leaf. Panels Q, R show ultrastructure of 
chloroplasts within the proximal (Q) and distal (R) regions of chlorenchyma cell at the tip of a young S. aralocaspica leaf. E, epidermis; C, chlorenchyma; 
CCC, central cytoplasmic compartment; D, distal end; G, grana; H, hypoderm; N, nucleus; P , proximal end; WS, water storage. Scale bars: 100 μm for 
A–D and J–M; 10 μm for E–G and N–P; 0.5μm for H, I, Q, R. (This figure is available in color at JXB online.)

Fig.  2C, G) the following series of events in structural dif -
ferentiation of SC-C 4 were observed. First, is the formation 
of the CCC, which earlier in its development was connected 
to the PC on one side of the cell. The CCC is either attached 
to one of the radial cell walls and the nucleus (when visible 
it is usually adjacent to the CCC and the cell wall); or, as 
observed in Fig. 2G, the CCC is well delimited in the center 
of the cells. Examination by TEM shows that both PC and 
CCC chloroplasts have a similar structure, with small grana 
(not shown). In Stage 3, numerous mitochondria are selec -
tively located within the CCC, but these are not fully differ -
entiated. The peripheral vascular bundles at this stage have 
differentiated phloem and xylem elements (not shown). At 
Stage 4, near the leaf tip, development of the characteristic 
features of chlorenchyma cells that define SC-C 4 in B. sinus-
persici is complete (Fig. 2D). All of the CCCs are positioned 
at the central region of the cell, and are only connected with 
the PC by thin cytoplasmic channels. Structurally dimorphic 
chloroplasts that characterize this species are established in 
Stage 4, with well-developed grana in the CCC chloroplast 
(Fig. 2H), and a deficiency in grana in the peripheral chlo -
roplasts (Fig. 2I). Also, in this stage the mitochondria have 
established a well-developed structure with clearly observable 
tubular cristae (not shown).
In S. aralocaspica, the basal Stage 1 chlorenchyma cells have 
a well-developed central vacuole that was observable from the 
earliest stages. The nucleus is located in the peripheral cyto -
plasm near the middle of the cell and chloroplasts are distrib-
uted along the cell periphery ( Fig. 2J, N). Differentiation of 
these chlorenchyma cells, which is initiated in Stage 2, con -
sists of cell elongation accompanied by the partitioning of 
organelles to distal and proximal ends, with multiplication 
of mitochondria and chloroplasts occurring at the proximal 
domain (Fig. 2K, O). At Stage 3, the cells were clearly more 
developmentally advanced, with an overall appearance that 
was mostly similar to the fully mature SC-C4 cells of Stage 4 
(Fig. 2L, P). However, more detailed observations by TEM 
revealed that ultrastructural differentiation of chloroplasts 
and mitochondria is not completed at Stage 3 (not shown). 
Only in Stage 4 structurally distinct dimorphic chloroplasts 
were clearly present, with the proximal chloroplasts having 
well-developed grana (Fig. 2Q) compared to the distal chlo -
roplasts (Fig.  2R). Also, mitochondria, which are localized 
to the proximal end of the cell, now show complete develop -
ment, with a characteristic tubular structure (not shown).
In situ hybridization of rbcL mRNA and 
immunocytochemistry of rbcL protein at different 
stages of leaf development
The temporal and spatial distribution of Rubisco rbcL 
mRNA was studied using in situ  hybridization of biotin-
11-UTP-labeled antisense RNA probes with longitudinal 
sections of young leaves ( Fig.  3A, B.  sinuspersici; Fig.  4A, 
S.  aralocaspica). Specific hybridization was clearly visual -
ized in chloroplasts as a dark purple color in B. sinuspersici 
(Fig. 3A, C–F) and S. aralocaspica (Fig. 4A, B, D–G). For 
a negative control, rbcL sense probes transcribed from the 
same plasmid in the opposite orientation showed little or no 
purple hybridization signal (Figs 3B, 4C). Antibody labeling 
of rbcL protein by immunolocalization with fluorescent con-
focal imaging appears in chloroplasts as yellow dots within 
the longitudinal sections (Figs 3G–J, 4H–K).
In B. sinuspersici, in the Stage 1 leaf region a clear hybridi-
zation signal for rbcL mRNA was observed within all of the 
chlorenchyma cell chloroplasts ( Fig.  3C), as well as in the 
chloroplasts present in the epidermal and water storage cells. 
Also in Stage 1, confocal imaging revealed considerable labe-
ling for rbcL, by immunolocalization, within all chloroplasts 
(Fig. 3G). In Stage 2, there was a similar pattern of hybridi -
zation for rbcL mRNA and immunolocalization of rbcL 
protein in all chloroplasts, as the developmental progression 
of cell elongation and position of organelles was beginning 
to occur ( Fig.  3D, H). At Stage 3, as positioning of chlo -
roplasts into the two separate domains was occurring, the 
hybridization signal for rbcL became more enhanced, with 
labeling observed in all of the chloroplasts ( Fig. 3E). Also, 
at this stage immunolocalization indicated that all of the 
chloroplasts contained rbcL protein (Fig. 3I). At Stage 4, the 
mature chlorenchyma cells clearly showed selective localiza -
tion of both rbcL mRNA and rbcL protein specifically within 
the CCC chloroplasts, with little or no signal observed in the 
peripheral chloroplasts (Fig. 3F, J).
In Stage 1 in S. aralocaspica, in situ hybridization and immu-
nolocalization showed labeling for rbcL mRNA ( Fig.  4D) 
and rbcL protein (Fig. 4H) within all of the chloroplasts. At 
Stage 2 and 3, while a clear increase in cytoplasmic volume 
and chloroplast number was observed within the proximal 
domain of chlorenchyma cells, all chloroplasts, in both the 
proximal and distal ends of the cell showed rbcL mRNA 
hybridization (Fig. 4E, F) and immunolocalization of rbcL 
protein (Fig. 4I, J). It was only in the most developmentally 
advanced Stage 4 towards the leaf tip that rbcL mRNA and 
rbcL protein became specifically confined to chloroplasts 
located within the proximal domain of the cell, with no labe-
ling observed in the distal end chloroplasts (Fig. 4G, K).
For a more precise quantitative evaluation of rbcL pro -
tein in the different cell regions, visualization of immunogold 
antibody labeling by TEM was applied with cross-sections of 
leaves at Stages 3 and 4 of development. Counting of gold 
particles within different subcellular compartments at Stage 
3 in both B. sinuspersici and S. aralocaspica confirmed a high 
level of labeling in chloroplasts located in both domains 
(Fig. 5). In the mature Stage 4 chlorenchyma cells, quantita -
tive evaluation confirmed a dramatic change, with selective 
localization of immunogold labeling within the CCC chlo -
roplasts of B. sinuspersici, and within the chloroplasts in the 
proximal domain of S. aralocaspica. Chloroplasts at the cell 
periphery in B. sinuspersici and in the distal compartment in 
cells of S. aralocaspica showed a dramatic drop in the density 
of gold particles as development progressed from Stage 3 to 
Stage 4 (9.3-fold in B.  sinuspersici and 3.5-fold in S.  aralo-
caspica) (Fig. 5). Interestingly, at the same time the density 
of labeling was declining in the distal chloroplasts in S. aralo-
caspica from Stage 3 to 4, there was a 1.5-fold increase in 
density in the proximal chloroplasts, while in B. sinuspersici 
Development of single cell C4 photosynthesis | 2593
maximum density of labeling for rbcL in the CCC occurred 
earlier, by Stage 3. In these young leaves there was very strong 
selective localization of rbcL to one chloroplast type at Stage 
4; but some rbcL was detected by TEM in the distal chloro -
plasts of S. aralocaspica (10% of that in the proximal chlo -
roplasts) and in the peripheral chloroplasts of B. sinuspersici 
(20% of that in the CCC chloroplasts) (Fig. 5).
Immunocytochemistry of PEP carboxylase protein at 
different stages of leaf development
For both B. sinuspersici and S. aralocaspica, immunolabeling 
of PEPC at the leaf base (Stage 1, Figs 3K , 4L) and dur -
ing the first stages of special chloroplast positioning (Stage 
2, Figs 3L , 4M) was very weak in chlorenchyma cells, and 
absent in all other tissues. At Stage 3 the accumulation of 
PEPC was more prominent ( Figs 3M , 4N) and at Stage 4 
chlorenchyma cells showed the highest levels of cytosolic 
PEPC protein, with even distribution throughout the cyto -
plasm (Figs 3N, 4O).
Western blot analysis of Rubisco and C4 pathway 
enzymes
Accumulation of representative C 4 pathway enzymes 
(PEPC, PPDK, NAD-ME) and Rubisco rbcL and rbcS, 
was analyzed by western blots during leaf development in 
B.  sinuspersici  and S.  aralocaspica . Total soluble protein 
extracts prepared from the base (where most chlorenchyma 
cells are at Stage 1), middle (most chlorenchyma cells at 
Stages 2 and 3) and tip (chlorenchyma cells at Stage 4) of 
young leaves (length 0.5–0.7  cm), and from mature leaves, 
were used for comparative developmental analysis ( Fig. 6). 
All five proteins increased gradually as leaf development 
progressed from the base to the tip, with the highest levels 
of accumulation found in mature leaves. The rbcL content 
in B.  sinuspersici at the base of the young leaf was 40% 
of that of mature leaves, increasing to 80% at the middle 
region of young leaves. In S.  aralocaspica , rbcL was ini -
tially lower than in B.  sinuspersici , with a more gradual 
increase in rbcL during development. The rbcS amount at 
the base of the young leaf was about 30% of mature leaf

in both species and it increased towards the tip to 80 and 
90% of mature leaf in B. sinuspersici  and S. aralocaspica , 
respectively.
Among the three C 4 cycle enzymes, levels of PPDK were 
found to be very low at the base of young leaves in both spe-
cies (4–5% compared to mature leaves), with developmental 
increases lagging well behind those observed for Rubisco 
(Fig. 6). Both species showed initially low levels of PEPC at 
the base of the young leaves, with accumulation increasing 
along the gradient to maximum levels at the leaf tip, reaching 
up to ~50% of that in mature leaves. In B.  sinuspersici, the 
levels of NAD-ME increased during development at a rate 
similar to rbcL, while its rate of increase in S. aralocaspica 
was notably slower.
Analysis of function: CO2 compensation points and 
dark respiration
Mature leaves of B. sinuspersici and S. aralocaspica displayed 
low compensation point (Г) values (2.5 and 2.9 µbar) at 25ºC 
and current atmospheric levels of O2 (20%); and, these values 
were insensitive to changes in level of O2 from 10% to 20% to 
40% (0.092, 0.184 and 0.369 mbar O2) (Fig. 7A). However, in 
the young leaves of both species there was a linear increase in 
Г with increasing O 2 from 10 to 40%. Additionally, at 25ºC 
and current ambient levels of O 2 (20%), Г in young leaves 
(0.5–0.7 cm) was ~7-fold higher than in mature B. sinuspersici 
leaves, and ~5-fold higher in S.  aralocaspica. In comparing 
the two species, there was no significant difference (at P<0.05)

between them for the value of Г in young leaves at 10 or 20% 
O2. However, Γ in B. sinuspersici appears to be more sensitive 
to increasing O2, and values at 40% O 2 were significantly (at 
P<0.05) higher than in S. aralocaspica. With increasing O 2, 
there was no significant increase (at P<0.05) in the rate of 
dark respiration for either species. In both species, at a given 
level of O2, rates appeared to be slightly higher in young than 
in mature leaves; however, there was no significant difference 
at P<0.1 (Fig. 7B).
Discussion
Structural and biochemical transitions towards 
development of SC-C4
The development, maintenance, and function of both forms 
of SC-C 4 require extensive structural differentiation to form 
two intracellular domains that strictly partition different sets 
of biochemical functions within a single cell. B. sinuspersici 
and S.  aralocaspica have independent evolutionary origins 
and possess structurally different forms of SC-C 4 chloren -
chyma cells. In both species, the chlorenchyma cells originate 
from the ground meristem; however, in B.  sinuspersici peri-
clinal divisions at the base of leaves give rise to two layers of 
chlorenchyma, while in S.  aralocaspica periclinal divisions 
give rise to a single chlorenchyma layer and a layer of hypo -
dermal cells. Previous analyses of mid-sections of leaves of 
different ages showed that chlorenchyma cells in young leaves 
have not developed the structural and biochemical properties 
that indicate transitions in development of SC-C 4 chloren -
chyma in Bienertia (Voznesenskaya et al., 2005; Lara et al., 
2008; Park et al., 2009) and S. aralocaspica (Voznesenskaya 
et  al., 2003 a). In this current study, detailed structural and 
biochemical analyses of these species along longitudinal 
gradients of young leaves demonstrate that, despite hav -
ing independent origins, different leaf anatomy and distinct 
chlorenchyma cell structures, the leaves of both species 
undergo very similar base-to-tip transitions to form C 4 type 
chlorenchyma cells. Four stages of chlorenchyma develop -
ment were recognized and defined with respect to structural 
and biochemical changes. Figure 8 indicates the progression 
of development of SC-C 4 in both species, in comparison to 
related Kranz-type C4 species in subfamily Suaedoideae.
In Stage 1, at the base of the leaf in the meristematic zone, 
chlorenchyma cells of B.  sinuspersici and S.  aralocaspica 
contain a few, ultrastructurally monomorphic, chloroplasts. 
There is no evidence for development of the two cytoplasmic 
zones in either species. Analogous to Stage 1 in the SC-C 4 
species, Kranz-type C4 Suaeda species possess M and BS pre-
cursor cells that contain ultrastructurally identical organelles 
(both chloroplasts and mitochondria) (Koteyeva et al., 2011).
At Stage 2 in both SC-C4 species and in Kranz-type Suaeda 
species, there is an increased expansion of photosynthetic 
cells. In B.  sinuspersici the specialization of SC-C 4 chlor -
enchyma cell structure continues with development of the 
CCC, together with enhanced chloroplast and mitochondria 
divisions around the nucleus. In S.  aralocaspica, the chlor -
enchyma cells become increasingly elongated, accompanied 
by increasing cytoplasmic volume at the proximal end due 
to multiplication of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Kranz-
type Suaeda species at this analogous stage of development 
are characterized by expansion of M cells with increase in 
vacuole volume and by multiplication of organelles in BS 
cells with initiation of their relocation to one side of the cell 
(Koteyeva et al., 2011).
At Stage 3, two intracellular domains are morphologi -
cally evident in both SC-C 4 species. These are precursors to 
the complete formation of C 4-C and C 4-D compartments. 
At this stage, chloroplasts within both domains still have a 
similar ultrastructure, but the mitochondria are now local -
ized to the C 4-D domain. At the analogous developmental 
stage in the Suaeda Kranz-type C 4 species, the chloroplasts 
and mitochondria in the BS cells have relocated from their 
original position around the periphery of the cell to either a 
centripetal position adjacent to the vascular bundles, or to a 
centrifugal position, depending on species. The chloroplasts 
in the BS and M cells have similar ultrastructure ( Koteyeva 
et al., 2011), like chloroplasts in the two domains of Stage 3 
SC-C4.
In both SC-C4 species, selective partitioning of chloroplasts 
and mitochondria into the two domains at Stage 3 is followed 
by later structural differentiation of these organelles in Stage 
4.  The C 4-C domains contain chloroplasts with reduced 
grana formation, while chloroplasts in the C4-D domain have 
well developed grana. In NAD-ME type C 4 species, includ -
ing B. sinuspersici and S. aralocaspica, conversion of alanine 
and atmospheric CO 2 to aspartate is considered to be the 
main flux in the carboxylation phase of the C 4 pathway, a 
conversion that requires only ATP . The reduction in grana

in the C 4-C domain in NAD-ME type C 4 species is consid -
ered to reflect a decreased requirement for PSII and NADPH 
production via linear electron flow ( Hatch, 1987). Similarly, 
in the two structural forms of Kranz-type Suaeda species, 
complete differentiation to C 4 chloroplasts and mitochon -
dria also occurs during the final stage of leaf development 
(Koteyeva et al., 2011). Thus, in all four distinct forms of C 4 
that occur in subfamily Suaedoideae, a final step in organelle

into three sections (base, middle, tip), and from mature fully expanded leaves. Blots were probed with antibodies raised against PEPC, PPDK, NAD-ME

differentiation is the specialized ultrastructural development 
of mitochondria and dimorphic chloroplasts. It is likely that 
signals regulating photochemical energy production between 
the two types of chloroplasts start to be transmitted after C 4 
function has distributed different demands for energy assimi-
lation between the two domains.
Quantitative analyses of protein accumulation from west -
ern blots indicate a basipetal developmental gradient for both 
SC-C4 species, with levels of photosynthetic enzymes increas-
ing along the length of the young leaves ( Fig. 8). rbcL and 
rbcS proteins are relatively abundant in young cells at the leaf 
base, indicating substantial levels of Rubisco during early 
Stage 1 development. In comparison, at the leaf base there is 
little expression of the representative C4 cycle enzymes PEPC, 
NAD-ME and especially PPDK, which could be functionally 
rate-limiting for the developing C 4 cycle at this early stage. 
Similarly, previous studies showed earlier accumulation of 
Rubisco (rbcL and rbcS) than the C 4 enzymes in very young 
leaves, with greatly increased accumulation of Rubisco and 
C4 enzymes in mature leaves of B. sinuspersici and B. cyclop-
tera ( Voznesenskaya et  al., 2005 ; Lara et  al., 2008 ) and 
S.  aralocaspica ( Voznesenskaya et  al., 2003 a). As with the 
SC-C4 species, photosynthetic enzyme levels in Kranz type 
Suaeda species increased along the leaf longitudinal gradient, 
with substantial Rubisco at the base of the leaf, and a lag in 
the accumulation of C4 enzymes, especially PPDK (Koteyeva 
et al., 2011).
Regulation of Rubisco expression in SC-C4
Mechanisms controlling the development of dimorphic chlo-
roplasts in SC-C 4 plants are not understood. Theories for 
selective targeting of nuclear encoded proteins to plastids in 
SC-C4 species (e.g. the small subunit of Rubisco, and PPDK) 
include selective import of required proteins into each plas -
tid type, selective mRNA targeting from the nucleus to one 
domain and/or selective degradation of the protein following 
import (Offermann et al., 2011). In a proteomics analysis of 
B. sinuspersici by Offermann et al. (2015), 35 nuclear-encoded 
proteins were found to be enriched in chloroplasts located to 
either the C4-C or C4-D domain. In fact, both groups of chlo-
roplast proteins had predicted plastid transit peptides with 
classical physiochemical properties found in other species. 
These groups were comprised of proteins with different func-
tional properties, including C 3 and C 4 carbon fixation path -
ways as well as certain proteins in light reactions.
The selective localization of Rubisco (consisting of the 
nuclear-encoded rbcS and chloroplast-encoded rbcL) for 
function within the C4-D domain is one of the most definitive 
biochemical features of SC-C 4. Transient expression studies 
using constructs expressing a GFP fusion with the B. sinus-
persici rbcS plastid transit peptide in B.  sinuspersici SC-C 4 
mesophyll protoplasts provided no evidence for selective 
import within these cells ( Rosnow et  al., 2014 ). In the cur -
rent study, chloroplast-encoded Rubisco rbcL was used as an 
indicator of changes in gene expression that occurs during 
the differentiation of dimorphic chloroplast along the lon -
gitudinal gradient of SC-C 4 development. rbcL mRNA, as 
well as its corresponding protein, was initially found within 
all chloroplasts of early chlorenchyma cells, both at the base 
(Stage 1) and middle (Stage 2, 3) regions of the young leaves. 
There were no quantitative differences in levels of Rubisco 
rbcL protein, mRNA or chloroplast structure that corre -
sponded with the initial differentiation to form two domains 
in either of the SC-C 4 species. Rather, selective partitioning 
of rbcL mRNA and its encoded protein to the C 4-D domain 
only occurred later, during Stage 4 at the leaf tip. This locali-
zation was tightly coordinated with the establishment of 
chloroplast structural dimorphism. Thus, a ‘default’ C 3-like 
pattern of rbcL mRNA and protein distribution appears to 
be maintained in chloroplasts during formation of the two 
cytoplasmic domains, with the more specialized SC-C4 distri-
bution pattern becoming established only at the final devel -
opmental stage. Spatial and temporal accumulation patterns 
for Rubisco rbcL mRNA correlated with rbcL protein accu -
mulation along the entire length of the longitudinal SC-C 4 
developmental gradient, indicating that transcript accumula-
tion is a major determinant for Rubisco accumulation specifi-
cally within the C 4-D domains of mature B. sinuspersici and 
S. aralocaspica leaves.
In contrast to SC-C 4 species, two Kranz-type spe -
cies of Suaeda ( Koteyeva et  al., 2011 ) showed selective 
Fig. 7. CO2 compensation points (Г) measured in the light, and rates of

compartmentalization of rbcL mRNA and protein to BS 
chloroplasts much earlier, at Stage 1 ( Fig.  8). In this case, 
cell-specific control of rbcL mRNA accumulation (by tran -
scription or mRNA stability) occurs prior to the structural 
dimorphism and positioning of BS chloroplasts. In con -
trast, in the SC-C 4 species, plastid-specific localization was 
observed only later, after development of the two cytoplasmic 
domains and chloroplast structural differentiation was com -
plete. Taken together, these findings suggest different ontoge-
netic programs for development of C 4 biochemistry have 
evolved independently in Kranz and SC-C4 species within the 
subfamily Suaedoideae.
Like the Kranz-type Suaeda species, early development of 
C4 has also been observed in some other Kranz-type C 4 spe-
cies. Positional control of Rubisco expression occurs very early 
in BS precursor cells in leaf primordia of maize ( Nelson and 
Langdale, 1992), in BS cells of Arundinella hirta (Wakayama 
et al., 2003), in BS cells at the base of young leaves in Atriplex 
rosea (Liu and Dengler, 1994; Dengler et al., 1995), and in C4 
species in family Cleomaceae (Koteyeva et al., 2014). A simi-
lar pattern was shown also for three species of Cyperaceae 
(Soros and Dengler, 2001 ). However, in other Kranz-type 
species the pattern of Rubisco expression during leaf devel -
opment was similar to that of SC-C 4 species. Amaranthus 
hypochondriacus (Wang et al., 1992, 1993) and Salsola richteri 
(Voznesenskaya et al. 2003b) show a prolonged C3-like distri-
bution in M and BS chloroplasts in the early stages of leaf 
development.
Recently it was shown that the rbcL-specific mRNA bind-
ing protein RLSB has a role in post-transcriptional rbcL 
expression and possibly selective plastid-specific accumu -
lation of Rubisco in several C 4 species, including SC-C 4 
B. sinuspersici as well as the C 4 dicots Suaeda taxifolia and 
Flaveria bidentis, and the C4 monocots Zea mays and Setaria 
viridis (Bowman et al., 2013; Rosnow et al., 2014). In B. sinus-
persici, RLSB is co-localized with Rubisco specifically within 
the central compartment chloroplasts ( Rosnow et al., 2014), 
while in Kranz-type species it co-localizes with Rubisco only 
in BS chloroplasts. It has been proposed that RLSB and the 
differential redox status of the dimorphic chloroplasts might 
work together to selectively control synthesis of Rubisco in 
the C4-D domain in B. sinuspersici (Rosnow et al., 2014). The 
established changes in rbcL mRNA and protein at different 
stages of leaf development demonstrated in this current study 
will serve as a framework for analyses currently in progress to 
determine how RLSB and other regulatory factors determine 
plastid-specific Rubisco accumulation in SC-C4 plant species.
Functional analysis of young versus mature leaves
The leaves of B. sinuspersici and S. aralocaspica are too small 
to accommodate analysis of photosynthetic traits by tra -
ditional gas exchange methods from the individual defined 
regions along the longitudinal leaf gradient. Therefore, a 
functional analysis of photosynthesis on young compared 
to mature leaves was made by measuring the sensitivity of 
Fig. 8. Illustrations of major differences during development of C4 photosynthesis from the basal region to the tip of young leaves in SC-C4 species 
versus Kranz-type C4 species in subfamily Suaedoideae. Progressive changes in differentiation in two types of SC-C4 species (B. sinuspersici and 
S. aralocaspica) are summarized from the current study, and compared with two structural forms of Kranz-type Suaeda species (S. taxifolia and 
S. eltonica) described previously (Koteyeva et al., 2011). The numbers within the leaves refer to stages of chlorenchyma development along young leaves 
(length ~0.6 cm). For comparison with SC-C4, the results with Kranz-type by Koteyeva et al. (2011) are summarized through four stages of development.

C4 species have a low Г between 1–5  µbar CO2, while in C 3 
plants the Г is 45–50 µbar CO2, and C3-C4 species have inter-
mediate values in the range of 9–30 µbar CO2 (Krenzer et al., 
1975; Ku et al., 1991; Vogan et al., 2007; Voznesenskaya et al., 
2013). Increasing levels of O 2 causes a linear increase in Γ 
in C3 plants (reflecting an increase in photorespiration), has 
little or no effect on Γ in C4 plants, but causes an intermedi -
ate, biphasic, response of Г in C3-C4 species (Ku et al., 1991). 
In mature leaves of both SC-C 4 species, Г was insensitive to 
increasing O2 levels up to 40%, with values characteristic of 
other C4 plants (2.5 to 3  µbar). However, in young leaves of 
both species, the Г values at 20% O 2 were intermediate to 
those of C 3 and C 4 plants. Also, values of Γ increase as O 2 
was raised from 10 to 40% (~1.7-fold increase in S.  aralo-
caspica and 2-fold increase in B. sinuspersici), which is indica-
tive of an increase in rates of photorespiration ( Brooks and 
Farquhar, 1985). Since dark-type respiration was not affected 
by increasing O2 from 10 to 20%, it is not considered to con -
tribute to the O 2-dependent increase in Γ. The sensitivity of 
Γ to increasing O 2 in young but not mature leaves provides 
additional support for transitions from C3, to intermediate, to 
a fully C4 state of photosynthesis along a longitudinal gradi -
ent in SC-C4 leaves.
C3 photosynthesis and photorespiration is expected at the 
base of young leaves where there is substantial Rubisco in 
all of the chloroplasts, with relatively low levels of other C 4 
enzymes. The two domains have not yet become established to 
support the C4 cycle, and are not yet capable of concentrating 
CO2 around Rubisco via dimorphic chloroplasts or for refixa-
tion of photorespired CO 2 from mitochondria. However, 
at Stages 2 and 3, development of two separate domains is 
progressing with increased expression of both Rubisco and 
C4 enzymes. The partitioning between domains in the mid-
section of young leaves is analogous to that of Kranz-like 
Type II C3-C4 intermediates. In C3-C4 intermediates Rubisco 
is localized in both M and BS chloroplasts. Intermediates 
reduce Γ and photorespiration by exclusive localization of 
glycine decarboxylase in BS mitochondria which allows pho-
torespired CO2 to be partially refixed. Type II intermediates 
have in addition a partially functional C4 cycle (Edwards and 
Ku, 1987). In the mid-sections of young leaves of SC-C4 spe-
cies, chloroplasts in both domains have Rubisco; however, the 
mitochondria, which are the sites of decarboxylation by gly -
cine decarboxylase as a consequence of photorespiration and 
by NAD-ME in the C 4 cycle, are localized only in the C 4-D 
domain. Finally, towards the tip of young leaves, Rubisco is 
selectively compartmentalized within the C 4-D domains of 
the chlorenchyma cells, and the SC-C4 anatomy and function 
have become fully developed with low photorespiration.
Concluding remarks
Two very different ontogenetic patterns of development exist 
between the SC-C4 and C4 Kranz-type members of the sub -
family Suaedoideae (family Chenopodiaceae). This includes 
differences in structural, biochemical and functional differen-
tiation in SC-C4 species compared to the Kranz-type species. 
The SC-C4 leaves show a clear longitudinal progression from 
a C3-default to intermediate to a full C 4 state, while C4 traits 
develop very early in the Kranz-type species. This implies 
major differences between these groups at the molecular level 
along the leaf longitudinal gradient for regulatory factors 
associated with photosynthetic gene expression (such as the 
selective compartmentalization of rbcL expression), as well as 
regulatory factors required for the development of structural 
features (such as differentiation of the unique SC-C 4 cellu -
lar domains and partitioning of organelles versus differen -
tiation of different cell types in Kranz-type C4 Suaedoideae). 
This strong difference in C4 development between SC-C4 and 
Kranz forms of C4 in subfamily Suaedoideae has wider impli-
cations for theories regarding the evolution of the C4 pathway.
In the SC-C 4 species B.  sinuspersici and S.  aralocaspica, 
the acquisition of full C 4 capability along the longitudinal 
leaf gradient is associated with a developmental shift from 
monomorphic to dimorphic chloroplasts, in coordination 
with plastid-specific partitioning of Rubisco rbcL mRNA 
and protein accumulation. Despite differences in anatomy 
and independent origin of these two species, the strong simi -
larity in their development of C 4 suggests comparative stud-
ies to identify regulatory factors controlling the development 
of SC-C 4 will be of interest. Future studies will focus on the 
identification and characterization of regulatory factors and 
signaling processes responsible for SC-C 4 development and 
how these processes differ and/or overlap with those respon-
sible for C4 development in Kranz-type C4 species.
