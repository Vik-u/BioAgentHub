Abstract 
Background: The demand for biobased polymers is increasing steadily worldwide. Microbial hosts for produc-
tion of their monomeric precursors such as glutarate are developed. To meet the market demand, production hosts 
have to be improved constantly with respect to product titers and yields, but also shortening bioprocess duration is 
important.
Results: In this study, adaptive laboratory evolution was used to improve a C. glutamicum strain engineered for 
production of the  C5-dicarboxylic acid glutarate by flux enforcement. Deletion of the l-glutamic acid dehydrogenase 
gene gdh coupled growth to glutarate production since two transaminases in the glutarate pathway are crucial for 
nitrogen assimilation. The hypothesis that strains selected for faster glutarate-coupled growth by adaptive labora-
tory evolution show improved glutarate production was tested. A serial dilution growth experiment allowed isolating 
faster growing mutants with growth rates increasing from 0.10  h−1 by the parental strain to 0.17  h−1 by the fastest 
mutant. Indeed, the fastest growing mutant produced glutarate with a twofold higher volumetric productivity of 
0.18 g  L−1  h−1 than the parental strain. Genome sequencing of the evolved strain revealed candidate mutations for 
improved production. Reverse genetic engineering revealed that an amino acid exchange in the large subunit of 
l-glutamic acid-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase was causal for accelerated glutarate production and its beneficial 
effect was dependent on flux enforcement due to deletion of gdh. Performance of the evolved mutant was stable 
at the 2 L bioreactor-scale operated in batch and fed-batch mode in a mineral salts medium and reached a titer 
of 22.7 g  L−1, a yield of 0.23 g  g−1 and a volumetric productivity of 0.35 g  L−1  h−1. Reactive extraction of glutarate 
directly from the fermentation broth was optimized leading to yields of 58% and 99% in the reactive extraction and 
reactive re-extraction step, respectively. The fermentation medium was adapted according to the downstream pro-
cessing results.
Conclusion: Flux enforcement to couple growth to operation of a product biosynthesis pathway provides a basis to 
select strains growing and producing faster by adaptive laboratory evolution. After identifying candidate mutations 
by genome sequencing causal mutations can be identified by reverse genetics. As exemplified here for glutarate 
production by C. glutamicum, this approach allowed deducing rational metabolic engineering strategies.

Introduction
Plastics still are synthesized primarily from natural gas 
and petroleum and only a fraction of 1% is bio-based. 
The demand for environmentally friendly alternatives 
is steadily increasing and the annual market volume of 
bioplastics is predicted to increase to 18% until 2025 [1]. 
Biopolyamides are gaining more interest for use in the 
textile and construction industries. Polyamides can be 
obtained either by condensation of dicarboxylic acids 
with diamines or by anionic ring-opening polymerization 
of lactams, the cyclization products of ω-amino acids [2]. 
Bio-based production of monomeric building blocks for 
polyamides has been established in metabolically engi -
neered C. glutamicum and E. coli [3, 4]. Fermentative 
production of the C4-ω-amino acid γ-aminobutyrate 
(GABA) [5, 6] and the C5-ω-amino acid 5-aminovaler -
ate (5AVA) has been established [7, 8] and, e.g., ring-
opening polymerization of 5AVA can be used to produce 
the polyamide 5 (PA 5) [9, 10]. Moreover, diamines like 
putrescine [11, 12] and cadaverine [13, 14] as well as the 
dicarboxylic acids succinate and glutarate [15–17] were 
successfully produced in high titers. Glutarate, e.g., is 
used as a building block for polyamides such as PA 4.5 
[18], PA 6.5, PA 12.5 [19] or PA 5.5 the latter of which  is 
synthesized by polycondensation of the C5-dicarboxylic 
acid glutarate with C5-diamine cadaverine [20]. Notably, 
the C5 polyamide building blocks cadaverine, 5AVA and 
glutarate can be synthesized from a common precursor, 
the amino acid l-lysine. Industrial l-lysine production by 
fermentation with Corynebacterium glutamicum is oper -
ated at large scale with an annual production volume of 
about 2.6 million metric tonnes in 2018 [4].
Glutarate can be derived from l-lysine by four different 
pathways. All four pathways converge to 5-aminovalerate 
(5AVA), which then is converted to glutarate in two enzy-
matic steps catalyzed by GABA/5AVA aminotransferase 
(GabT) and succinate/glutarate semialdehyde dehydro -
genase (GabD). The first pathway from l -lysine to 5AVA 
employs l-lysine-α-oxidase (RaiP) from Scomber japoni -
cus that catalyzes oxidative deamination of l-lysine using 
molecular oxygen followed by spontaneous decarboxyla -
tion [21]. The second pathway to 5AVA combines oxida -
tive decarboxylation by l -lysine monooxygenase (DavA) 
using molecular oxygen followed by desamidation by 
γ-aminovaleramidase (DavB) from Pseudomonas putida 
[20]. The third pathway is based on l -lysine decarboxy-
lase from E. coli, putrescine oxidase PuO from Rhodoc -
occus qingshengii, which requires molecular oxygen, and 
γ-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase PatD from E. coli 
[8]. The fourth pathway does not require molecular oxy -
gen as it cascades l-lysine decarboxylase, 2-oxoglurate-
dependent putrescine/cadaverine transaminase PatA, and 
NAD-dependent γ-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase 
PatD from E. coli [ 7]. The pathway combinations LdcC-
PuO-PatD-GabT-GabD and LdcC-PatA-PatD-GabT-
GabD couple conversion of l -lysine to glutarate either to 
one (GabT) or two (PatA, GabT) transaminase reactions, 
respectively, which generate l-glutamic acid from 2-oxo -
glutarate. Deletion of gdh, the gene for the major ammo -
nium assimilating enzyme l-glutamic acid dehydrogenase 
[8, 16], enabled flux enforcement (Fig.  1, left panel), i.e., 
the metabolic setup in which growth requires produc -
tion of glutarate. In general, GDH is active under nitro -
gen surplus conditions and has a low affinity towards its 
substrates ammonia and 2-oxoglutarate [22]. By contrast, 
the enzyme pair glutamine synthetase (GS) and l -glu-
tamic acid-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT, 
also known as l-glutamic acid synthase) synthesizes 
l-glutamic acid in an ATP dependent manner during 
ammonium starvation at ammonium concentrations 
below 5  mM [23]. The GS/GOGAT system is encoded 
by glnA for GS and gltBD for the large and small subu -
nits  of GOGAT (Fig.  1, right panel). The net reaction of 
the combined activities of GS and GOGAT results in ATP 
and NADPH dependent conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to 
l-glutamic acid, while GDH only requires NADPH for 
reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate to l-glutamic acid. 
It is known that GS/GOGAT can compensate for the lack 
of GDH [24] also at higher nitrogen concentrations (up to 
40 mM) [25].
Systems metabolic engineering proved successful to 
achieve high titer glutarate production by metabolically 
engineered C. glutamicum [16, 17, 26]. In this study, we 
aimed to accelerate glutarate production by evolution -
ary engineering. Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) 
allows to leverage natural selection to optimize a target 
property of a production strain without the requirement 
of a priori knowledge of the genetic background [27, 28]. 
This approach is straightforward if a growth advantage 
can be selected for. This was easily implemented, e.g., 
when higher tolerance against a compound is sought or 
to improve substrate utilization and to optimize growth 
rates [29, 30]. Moreover, it can also be used to identify 
non‐intuitive targets for strain engineering, and ulti -
mately to gain a comprehensive understanding of bio -
logical pathway regulation [31]. In C. glutamicum, ALE

allowed to accelerate growth of the wild-type [32, 33], to 
increase tolerance towards higher temperatures [34] and 
methanol [35, 36], to improve consumption of xylose and 
cellobiose [37, 38], and to increase production of putres -
cine and ornithine [39, 40].
We have chosen to apply ALE in order to accelerate glu-
tarate production via the LdcC-PatA-PatD-GabT-GabD 
pathway since two of the involved transaminase reactions 
(PatA, GabT) provide l-glutamic acid from 2-oxoglutar -
ate and, thus, compensate for the lack of GDH due to the 
deletion of its gene [8, 16]. The resulting flux enforcement 
provides a selectable trait by linking metabolic productiv-
ity to growth. In this metabolic setup, the rate of growth 
(requiring l-glutamic acid) is coupled to the rate of gluta-
rate production (providing l-glutamic acid) and selection 
of faster growing mutants yielded strains with increased 
volumetric productivity. Mutations identified by genome 
sequencing could be rationalized by reverse genetics.
Moreover, in order to complement strain development, 
purification of glutarate from the fermentation broth 
using a combination of reactive extraction and reactive re-
extraction was considered. For this purpose, we adapted 
an approach, which was previously used for the purifica -
tion of itaconic acid and is based on an aqueous organic 
extraction system and tertiary amines as (reactive) extract-
ants [41], to serve for the recovery of glutarate by identifi-
cation of optimal (reactive) extractants and organic phases 
in dedicated screening experiments. During the reactive 
extraction, the amine extractant interacts with glutarate 
building a hydrophobic complex, which is then extracted 
to the organic phase (separation from impurities). The 
results reveal that the concept allows for an efficient sepa-
ration of glutarate from a crude fermentation broth show-
ing high yields and selectivities, opening the window for 
industrial production.

Results
Adaptive laboratory evolution of flux enforced 
glutarate production improved volumetric productivity 
by metabolically engineered C. glutamicum
By serendipity, we found that repeated cultivation of 
strain GluA [16] starting from single colonies yielded 
a variant that showed faster growth (named GluA T0). 
Plasmid insert sequencing revealed that a point muta -
tion occurred in the gene coding for succinate semi -
aldehyde dehydrogenase GabD from P. stutzeri. This 
resulted in amino acid exchange P134L in GabD. The 
maximal growth rate of glutarate producer GluA T0 
with  GabDP134L was increased to 0.12 ± 0.00  h−1 in com-
parison to 0.05 ± 0.00   h−1 for the isogenic strain with 
wild-type GabD (Fig.  2a). Since growth was coupled 
to production by flux enforcement, an almost twofold 
higher glutarate production resulted using  GabDP134L 
(45 ± 2  mM) instead of the native version of GabD 
(25 ± 1  mM). A Phyre model of the succinate semialde -
hyde dehydrogenase GabD from P. stutzeri [22] revealed 
that P134 is part of the oligomerization interface of the 
protein [42]. GabD from P. putida [43] and E. coli [44] are 
homotetramers. CUPSAT calculations of  GabDP134L sug-
gested decreased protein stability as compared to GabD 
[45]. This prompted us to determine GabD activities in 
crude extracts of E. coli strains DH5α (pEC-XT99A-
gabTD) and DH5α (pEC-XT99A-gabTD P134L). The com -
bined in  vitro enzyme activities of GABA transaminase 
GabT and GabD were monitored spectrophotometrically. 
To study if the amino acid exchange P134L affects a pos -
sible feedback inhibition by glutarate, these assays were 
performed in the presence of glutarate concentrations 
up to 40 mM. Feedback-inhibition by 30 and 40 mM glu -
tarate was found for both GabD and  GabDP134L (Fig. 2b), 
while at 10 mM glutarate their activities were increased. 
Notably, in the presence of 10 and 20  mM glutarate 
 GabDP134L activity was significantly higher than that of 
GabD (Fig. 2b).
This initial finding of a mutation of the original strain 
that led to faster growth and better glutarate produc -
tion prompted us to perform an ALE experiment. There -
fore, strain GluA T0 was used to start a serial transfer 
and after it grew from the  OD600 of 1 at inoculation to 
an  OD600 of approximately 8. At every transfer, one ali -
quot was streaked out on agar plates and three single 
colonies were selected and used to make glycerol stocks 
(triplicate glycerol stocks GluA T1 until triplicate glyc -
erol stocks GluA T8). A second aliquot was used to inoc -
ulate the subsequent transfer culture to an initial  OD600 
of 1. This process was repeated until the eighth transfer 
culture (GluA T8) and times to reach an  OD600 about 8 
were shortened from transfer to transfer. For compari -
son, a growth and glutarate production experiment was 
performed in the BioLector microcultivation system 
starting from the frozen glycerol stocks of strains GluA 
T0 to GluA T8. Confirming the observations during the

ALE transfer experiment, growth of the evolved strains 
gradually accelerated (Fig.  3a). The characterization of 
the evolved strains revealed that the maximal growth rate 
µmax increased gradually from 0.10   h−1 for the parental 
glutarate producer (GluA T0) to 0.17   h−1 for GluA T5, 
but it did not increase further for the following three 
transfers (Fig. 3b).
As growth was coupled to production by flux enforce -
ment, glutarate productivity increased when growth was 
accelerated (Fig. 3b). The maximal product titers of gluta-
rate and its precursor 5AVA were reached after the sev -
enth transfer and ALE strain GluA T7 accumulated 10% 
more glutarate and tenfold more 5AVA (20 ± 1 mM com-
pared to 2 ± 0  mM) than the parent strain (Fig.  3b). As 
consequence of the combined beneficial effects of faster 
growth and increased production, ALE strain GluA T7 
reached its maximal biomass already after 24 h (Fig.  3a). 
The volumetric productivity of 0.18 ± 0.00  g   L−1  h−1 
was twofold higher than that of the parental GluA T0 
(0.09 ± 0.00  g   L−1  h −1). GluA T5 had its maximum 
 OD600 after 30  h with a volumetric productivity of 
0.13 ± 0.00 g  L−1  h−1.
RNAseq analysis of global gene expression patterns in ALE 
strains GluA T5 and GluA T7
The ALE experiment allowed to select strain GluA T5, 
which grew faster and produced more glutarate than 
the parent strain, and strain GluA T7 that grew as fast 
as GluA T5, but which produced more 5AVA than GluA 
T5. In order to reveal gene expression changes between 
GluA T5, GluA T7 and the parental strain GluA T0, RNA 
was isolated from cells growing exponentially in CGXII 
minimal medium supplemented with 40  g   L−1 glucose 
and 1  mM IPTG in triplicates, sequenced and mapped 
to the reference genome (Additional file  2: Tables S1, 
S2). Of the 110 genes differentially expressed in the 
comparison between strains GluA T5 and GluA T0, 52 
genes were downregulated in GluA T5. Among them, 
sucCD (cg2835, cg2837), coding for succinyl-CoA syn -
thetase, and aceA (cg2560), encoding isocitrate lyase, are 
key enzymes of the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. 
Of the 62 genes upregulated in GluA T5, seven code 
for transporters, e.g., mediating uptake of phosphate 
(cg1651),  Na+ (cg1624, cg3027, cg3028),  Co2+ (cg3134) 
or iron (cg0770, cg0771), and one for an uncharacterized 
transcriptional regulator (cg3291). Since flux enforce -
ment involved deletion of the dehydrogenase gene gdh , 
it is noteworthy that the gene for the putative l-glutamic 
acid exporter YggB (cg1434) was downregulated in both 
GluA T5 and GluA T7.
Of the 173 genes differentially expressed in the com -
parison between GluA T7 and the parental strain GluA 
T0, 107 were downregulated in GluA T7. Many of those 
genes are involved in the nitrogen starvation response 
and they belong to AmtR regulon: ureABCEFGD (encod -
ing urease), urtABCDE (encoding ABC-transporter 
for urea), amt-ocd-soxA (coding for ammonium per -
mease, ornithine decarboxylase and sarcosine oxidase),

amtB-glnK-glnD (ammonium transporter, GlnK, uri -
dylyltrasnferase) and gltBD (glutamine 2-oxoglutarate 
amidotransferase) [22, 46]. Thus, the gene expression 
changes observed in ALE strains GluA T5 and GluA T7 
affected nitrogen assimilation, l-glutamic acid metab -
olism and transport processes, but not genes of the 
synthetic LdcC-PatA-PatD-GabT-GabD pathway for glu-
tarate production. At first sight, the transcriptome analy -
sis was not instructive to explain the improved glutarate 
production of the strains selected by ALE.
Genome sequencing and reverse genetics for identification 
of mutations causal for improved glutarate production 
by ALE strains GluA T5 and GluA T7
The genomes of the ALE strains GluA T5, which grew 
faster and produced more glutarate than the parental 
strain, and GluA T7 that did not grow faster than GluA 
T5, but produced more 5AVA and glutarate than GluA 
T5, were sequenced to identify genetic differences to the 
parental strain. Subsequently, reverse engineering was 
performed to identify those mutations that are causal for 
improved growth and/or glutarate production.
Surprisingly, genome sequencing of strain GluA T5 did 
neither reveal genome-based nor plasmid-based muta -
tions in comparison to the non-evolved strain GluA T0. 
However, analysis of the sequence reads mapped to DNA 
of the three expression plasmids showed increased plas -
mid copy numbers (PCN) of all three plasmids. In the 
absence of changes in the DNA sequence of the plas -
mids, we can only invoke epigenetic changes, e.g. due 
to methylation. It is known that plasmid DNA methyla -
tion is required for plasmid replication contributing to 
regulation of replication reinitiation and the accuracy 
of the copy-number control [47]. The PCN of plasmid 
pVWEx1-ldcC carrying the gene for the first step of glu -
tarate production was 13 ± 1, and 17 ± 1 for strains GluA 
T0 and GluA T5, respectively. For plasmid pEKEx3-
patDA comprising genes coding for step two and three of 
the pathway the PCN increased from 107 ± 2 (GluA T0) 
to 121 ± 11 (GluA T5). The PCN for the plasmid pEC-
XT99A-gabTDP134L with the genes of the last two steps 
was 10 ± 1 for GluA T0 and 14 ± 0 for GluA T5. Taken 
together, genome sequencing revealed only increased 
PCN for all three plasmids that provide the glutarate bio -
synthesis pathway and this may explain faster growth of 
GluA T5 as compared to GluA T0.
Genome sequencing of strain GluA T7 revealed compa-
rable PCN for plasmids pVWEx1-ldcC (17 ± 1 vs. 17 ± 1) 
and pEKEx3-patDA (124 ± 2 vs. 121 ± 11) as compared to 
GluA T5, while the PCN of plasmid pEC-XT99A-gabT -
DP134L was higher (19 ± 0 vs. 14 ± 0). Importantly, two 
mutations were identified in GluA T7 that were absent 
from strains GluA T0 and GluA T5. The first mutation 
was found in plasmid pEC-XT99A-gabTDP134L: a deletion 
of 21 bp in the coding sequence of the antibiotic resist -
ance marker of this plasmid, i.e. in for tetracycline efflux 
permease gene tetA(Z), shortened the encoded protein 
by 7 amino acids. The deletion comprised a direct repeat 
(5′-TGA CTG CTC GCT ACT CTC ATC-3′ (tetA(Z) Δ21bp, 
Additional file  1: Figure S1A). As consequence the TetZ 
protein was shortened and lacked amino acids 8 to 14 in 
the N-terminal part before the first transmembrane helix. 
RNAseq data confirmed the deletion and showed that the  
mutated gene was transcribed. Analysis of the shortened 
protein by SignalP [48] and by TMHMM [49] suggested 
that there is no signal peptide and predicted twelve trans-
membrane helices as in the intact tetracycline efflux per -
mease protein, thus, the sequence is shortened before the 
first transmembrane helices of the protein. Deletion of 
direct repeats on plasmids are known and the frequency 
of these events depends on the location and the length of 
the repeats [50, 51]. Moreover, the absence of the anti -
biotic resistance and the growth rate are crucial for the 
frequency [52]. To investigate the influence of shortage 
on the protein function, we determined the minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tetracycline. GluA 
T0 displayed a MIC of 20 µg   mL−1 tetracycline, whereas 
a strain carrying the mutated plasmid only had a MIC of 
10 µg   mL−1 (Additional file  1: Figure S1B). Possibly, the 
higher PCN of plasmid pEC-XT99A-gabTD P134L in GluA 
T7 as compared to GluA T0 and GluA T5 compensated 
for the reduced antibiotic resistance level by mutation 
pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z)Δ21bp.
The second mutation affected an enzyme involved in 
l-glutamic acid biosynthesis from 2-oxoglutarate, glu -
tamine 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (Fig. 1). This sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was named gltB E686Q 
as it resulted in an exchange of amino acid 686 in the 
large subunit of glutamine 2-oxoglutarate aminotrans -
ferase GltB from l-glutamic acid (E) to glutamine (Q). 
Analysis of the 3D structure of GltB by Phyre2 [42] did 
neither suggest that the active center nor the binding of 
the small subunit GltD was affected. CUPSAT analysis 
[45] suggested that this amino acid exchange may have 
a destabilizing effect. COACH-D based modeling [53] 
did not indicate altered interaction with the substrates 
2-oxoglutarate and NADPH, but may indicate changed 
binding of the substrate glutamine. The determination of 
the Km for glutamine in the crude extract of GRLys1ΔgltB 
overexpressing the native and the mutated version of 
gltBD revealed that the SNP in GltB resulted in a twofold 
higher Km of 0.52 ± 0.04 mM than the wild-type enzyme 
(0.25 ± 0.03 mM) (Additional file  1: Figure S2). The wild-
type Km was comparable to that reported for the related 
C. glutamicum subsp. flavum (0.24 mM) [54].

To test if the identified mutations are causal for 
improved glutarate production, they were introduced 
into the parental strain GluA T0 either individually or 
combined. First, the mutated vector named pEC-XT99A-
tetA(Z)Δ21bp-gabTDP134L was isolated from the evolved 
strain GluA T7 and used to replace the unmutated vec -
tor pEC-XT99A-gabTD P134L in GluA T0. To this end, 
pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z)Δ21bp-gabTDP134L was used to trans -
form the precursor strain GSLA2G (pVWEx1-ldcC) 
(pEKEx3-patDA) and the obtained strain was named 
GluA RG1. Next, the SNP gltB E686Q was introduced into 
GluA T0 (via two-step recombination in the genome of 
the plasmid-less precursor strain GSLA2G, followed 
by transformation with the plasmids pVWEx1-ldcC, 
pEKEx3-patDA and pEC-XT99A-gabTD P134L) yield -
ing strain GluA RG2. Strain GluA RG3 was constructed 
to contain both, the SNP gltB E686Q and the plasmid 
pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z)Δ21bp-gabTDP134L.
Strain GluA RG1 grew very slowly (0.04 ± 0.01  h−1) to 
a reduced biomass concentration and glutarate produc -
tion (23 ± 1  mM) was reduced to half as compared to 
the parental strain GluA T0 (45 ± 2  mM). However, the 
glutarate yield per biomass of 1.2 g   g−1 was comparable 
to that of GluA T0 (1.0 g   g−1) (Table 1). Thus, as a result 
of the 21 bp off-frame deletion in the coding sequence of 
tetA(Z) in plasmid pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z) Δ21bp-gabTDP134L, 
growth was perturbed, while the cell-specific glutarate 
production was not affected.
As consequence of introducing the amino acid 
exchange E686Q in GltB, strain GluA RG2 produced 
more glutarate (55 ± 2 mM; + 22%) and more of its direct 
precursor 5AVA (7 ± 1 mM; + 250%; Fig. 4) as compared 
to the parental GluA T0. Due to flux enforcement, strain 
GluA RG2 also grew faster than GluA T0 (0.13   h−1; 
+ 30%). This result is commensurate with the finding by 
RNAseq analysis that the nitrogen starvation response is 
triggered in strains GluA T0 and GluA T5 that lack the 
amino acid exchange E686Q in GltB, but not in GluA T7 
that carries this mutation.
The reverse engineered strain GluA RG3 that carried 
the 21 bp deletion in pEC-XT99A in addition to  GltBE686Q 
showed a higher growth rate (Fig.  4). Since the glutar -
ate titer was comparable for GluA RG2 and GluA RG3, 
a higher volumetric productivity for glutarate resulted 
when mutations  GltBE686Q and the 21  bp deletion were 
both present (Table  1). Thus,  GltBE686Q and the 21  bp 
deletion showed covariance with the beneficial effect 
on glutarate by  GltBE686Q being epistatic over the 21  bp 
deletion. In other words, this may indicate that only after 
 GltBE686Q improved l-glutamic acid biosynthesis, the 
21 bp deletion supported faster growth and, thus, higher 
volumetric productivity for glutarate.
The beneficial effect of  GltBE686Q depends on the deletion 
of gdh
Next, we tested if the beneficial effect of  GltBE686Q 
requires (a) deletion of gdh  or (b) is only seen upon flux 
enforced glutarate production via the LdcC-PatA-PatD-
GabT-GabD route. Therefore, the  GltBE686Q mutation 
was introduced either into the plasmid-less precursor 
strain GSLA2, which overproduces l-lysine, or its deriva-
tive GSLA2G that carries the gdh  deletion. Production 
of l-lysine by these strains, named GSLA2::gltB E686Q and 
GSLA2G::gltBE686Q, was compared to l-lysine produc -
tion by their parental strains GSLA2 and GSLA2G that 
carry wild-type gltB. As consequence of the gdh  deletion, 
production of l-lysine was decreased by about 38% (com-
pare strains GSLA2 and GSLA2G in Fig.  5). While dele -
tion of gdh  is known to be dispensable for biosynthesis

of L-glutamic acid for growth requirements [24], deletion 
of gdh was negative for overproduction of lysine (Fig.  5). 
This indicated that the GS/GOGAT system suffices to 
replace gdh for growth requirements, but not to provide 
enough  assimilated nitrogen for overproduction of the 
amino acid l -lysine. Introduction of the  GltBE686Q muta-
tion into strain GSLA2 did not change l-lysine production 
significantly (compare strain GSLA2::gltBE686Q with GSLA2 
in Fig.  5). Upon introduction of the  GltBE686Q mutation 
into the gdh deletion mutant GSLA2G, significantly more 
l-lysine was produced (compare strain GSLA2G::gltBE686Q 
with GSLA2G in Fig.  5). This indicated that provision of 
assimilated nitrogen via the mutant GS/GOGAT system 
in the gdh deletion mutant was apparently high enough to 
support production of l-lysine to a titer comparable to that 
of the gdh-positive parental strain GSLA2. Thus, the ben-
eficial effect of  GltBE686Q is dependent on deletion of gdh.
Moreover, since the combined presence of the  GltBE686Q 
mutation and the gdh deletion improved both production 
of l-lysine (Fig. 5) and of glutarate (Fig.  4), the beneficial 
effect of  GltBE686Q is independent of conversion of l-lysine 
to glutarate via the LdcC-PatA-PatD-GabT-GabD route. 
This mutation pair (gltBE686Q, Δgdh) may be helpful for pro-
duction processes that involve l-lysine as intermediate.
Fermentative glutarate production by evolved strain GluA 
T7 in comparison to GluA T0
Since stable performance of a production host in reac -
tor scale is essential for the biotechnological applica -
tion, we compared the evolved strain GluA T7 with the 
parental strain GluA T0 in batch-mode bioreactor culti -
vation (3.7 L). The parental strain GluA T0 grew with a 
maximal growth rate of 0.11  h−1 and reached its maximal 
biomass concentration of 13.1 g   L−1 after 32 h (Fig.  6a). 
The final titer was 2.0 g   L−1 glutarate and remained sta -
ble after 36 h of cultivation. The volumetric productivity 
was 0.05  g   L−1  h−1, the biomass-specific yield of 0.19  g 
(g CDW)−1 and the substrate-specific yield 0.04 g   g−1. By 
comparison, GluA T7 grew with a growth rate of 0.19  h−1

antifoam agent AF204 (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) was 
added to the medium manually before inoculation

and reached its maximal biomass of 10.1  g   L−1 already 
after 20  h cultivation (Fig.  6b). The glutarate titer was 
4.3 g  L−1 and 1.2 g  L−1 5AVA accumulated as by-product. 
The volumetric productivity was 0.21  g   L−1   h−1 with a 
substrate-specific yield of 0.10 g   g−1 and a biomass-spe -
cific yield of 0.51  g   g−1. Thus, in batch-mode fermenta -
tion, GluA T7 clearly outcompeted its precursor strain 
regarding product titer, volumetric productivity, and 
yield (Fig. 6).
Next, fed-batch mode cultivation of GluA T7 was 
performed to achieve higher glutarate titers. In the 
batch phase (0–24  h), the cells grew with a growth rate 
of 0.15   h−1 up to 7.7  g   L−1 cell dry weight (CDW) and 
4.4 g   L−1 glutarate was produced (Fig.  7). After 24 h the 
feed was started and in the following 40 h around 890 mL 
feed solution (ρ = 1.1  kg   m−3) were added. In total, 
22.7 g  L−1 of glutarate were produced within 64 h with a 
volumetric productivity of 0.35 g   L−1  h−1. The glutarate 
yield on glucose was 0.23 g   g−1. With a maximal biomass 
concentration of 14.0  g   L−1, 1  g cells produced 1.64  g 
glutarate.
Reactive extraction of glutarate from the cultivation broth
After strain engineering enabled an efficient bioreac -
tor process, we sought to develop efficient downstream 
processing for glutarate. To this end, reactive extraction 
experiments were conducted with molar ratios of amine 
extractant/glutarate ranging from 1/1 to 10/1 in order to 
investigate the required amount of amine extractant for 
an optimal reactive extraction (maximizing the yield). 
Amine extractants screened for this purpose were tri-n-
hexylamine (T-C6) and tri-n-octylamine (T-C8) and ethyl 
oleate was chosen as organic phase due to its hydropho -
bic nature and biocompatibility [55].
If T-C6 was used as (reactive) amine extractant in com-
bination with ethyl oleate organic phase, the formation of 
a third-phase was observed for all amine concentrations 
applied. To circumvent the formation of a third phase, 
1-dodecanol was added to the organic extraction phase 
as (polar) modifier to increase the polarity of the organic 
phase, and, thus, to enhance the solubility of the hydro -
phobic acid–amine complex in the organic phase. The 
optimal amount of modifier in the organic phase, i.e., the 
lowest amount necessary to prevent third-phase forma -
tion, was identified to be 10 wt% for the reactive extrac -
tion system containing T-C6 (ratio of amine extractant/
glutarate = 10/1). The results of reactive extraction exper-
iments at T = 25  °C and p = 1  bar using T-C6 as amine 
extractant in ethyl oleate containing 10  wt% of 1-dode -
canol are illustrated in Fig. 8a.
The results clearly showed that with increasing T-C6 
content, the amount of glutarate being extracted from 
the aqueous phases increased until reaching a plateau 
at 58.1% glutarate yield (for molar ratios of T-C6/glu -
tarate = 9/1 or higher). In contrast to T-C6 as amine 
extractant, reactive extraction systems containing T-C8 
as amine extractant only showed a formation of a third-
phase at molar ratios of T-C8/glutarate = 6/1 or higher. 
Thus, 1-dodecanol was used as polar modifier (10  wt% 
1-dodecanol in the organic phase) for extractions at 
molar ratios exceeding 6/1. The results of reactive extrac-
tion experiments at T = 25  °C and p = 1  bar using T-C8 
as amine extractant are shown in Fig.  8b. The yield 
increased with increasing amount of T-C8 in the organic 
phase reaching a near plateau for high ratios of T-C8/glu-
tarate, namely 8/1 and 10/1, where yield only increased 
from 52.5 to 54.1%. As higher reactive extraction yields 
could be achieved using T-C6 at a lower molar ratio of 
9/1 (up to 58.1%), higher molar ratios of T-C8 (exceeding 
10/1) were not investigated. As a result of these experi -
ments, the system containing T-C6 as amine extract -
ant, ethyl oleate as organic phase containing 10  wt% of 
1-dodecanol as polar modifier, served as basis for the fol -
lowing re-extraction experiments described hereafter.
Upon reactive re-extraction, the acid–amine com -
plex in the organic phase is brought into contact with a 
water-soluble amine (WSA) in a (fresh) aqueous phase. 
As the WSA forms a stronger complex with the acid,

phase forming a water-soluble complex with the WSA. 
The results for re-extraction experiments conducted 
with the water-soluble amines n-propylamine (M-C3) 
and n-butylamine (M-C4) at molar ratios of WSA/glu -
tarate (organic) ranging from 1/1 to 5/1 at T = 25 °C and 
p = 1 bar are illustrated in Fig.  9. Increasing amounts of 
both WSA’s led to increasing re-extraction yields until 
the maximum respective re-extraction yield was reached 
in systems containing a molar ratio of WSA/glutarate 
(organic) = 3.5/1 or higher. The use of both WSA’s as 
amine extractant led to maximum re-extraction yields of 
99%. Taken together, efficient downstream processing of 
glutarate containing fermentation broth based on a com -
bination of reactive extraction and reactive re-extraction 
of glutarate was developed.
Discussion
In this study, flux enforcement coupling growth to 
l-glutamic acid production by C. glutamicum provided 
the basis to select strains growing and producing faster 
by adaptive laboratory evolution. Among the candi -
date mutations determined by genome sequencing two 
causal mutations were identified by reverse genetics. 
This approach almost doubled volumetric productivity 
and in fed-batch bioreactor cultures a titer of 22.7 g   L−1, 
a yield of 0.23  g   g−1 and a volumetric productivity of 
0.35  g   L−1  h−1 were achieved. Purification of glutarate 
directly from the fermentation broth leading to yields of 
58% and 99% in the reactive extraction and reactive re-
extraction step, respectively, was established.
This report is not the first on metabolic engineering of 
C. glutamicum for glutarate production [8, 16, 17, 26], 
but the first example of improving volumetric productiv -
ity by flux enforcement and ALE. Notably, engineering 
of the GS/GOGAT system, which was identified here as 
crucial to accelerate glutarate production, has not been 
reported previously as metabolic engineering target for 
glutarate production by C. glutamicum. Strain engineer -
ing, e.g., by overexpressing ynfM encoding the recently 
discovered glutarate exporter, media optimization, e.g., 
by using mixtures of glucose and sucrose, and process 
intensification, e.g., by using a pH–stat feeding strategy 
in fed-batch cultures, have been described to boost glu -
tarate production to titers of more than 100  g   L−1 [17]. 
Thus, the mutation pair identified here  (GltBE686Q and 
deletion of gdh ) complements the previously described 
metabolic engineering strategies for glutarate production 
by C. glutamicum. It has to be noted that yggB RNA levels 
were reduced in both ALE strains and this gene codes for 
a transport system involved in export of l-glutamic acid 
out of the C. glutamicum cell [56], although l-glutamic 
acid export is not abolished in its absence [57]. Since the 
flux enforcement strategy used here relied on gdh  dele -
tion, thus, the major enzyme for synthesis of l-glutamic 
acid is absent, the reduced yggB RNA levels may help to 
avoid loss of l-glutamic acid from the C. glutamicum cell 
by export. Possibly, deletion of yggB may increase strin -
gency of the flux enforcement by gdh  deletion. Trans -
port engineering has proven important for improving C.

glutamicum processes [58], not only regarding substrate 
uptake [59] or product export (e.g., ynfM, [17]), but also 
to avoid loss of intermediates (used here to avoid export 
of the intermediate cadaverine).
The strains analysed here lacked gdh . The growth rate 
of a gdh  deletion mutant is reduced due to a partially 
triggered nitrogen starvation response as evidenced by, 
e.g., partial adenylylation of GlnK, such that ammonium 
is assimilated by GS/GOGAT. However, since the intra -
cellular l-glutamic acid pool is not completely restored 
and the GS/GOGAT has an increased energy demand 
(1 ATP per  NH3 fixed), growth in the absence of gdh  
is slower than in its presence. The SNP in gltB resulted 
in amino acid exchange E686Q in the large subunit of 
GOGAT  (GltBE686Q). The large subunit serves two func -
tions allocated to two domains: hydrolysis of l-glutamine 
to  NH3 and l-glutamic acid on the one hand and com -
bining the produced  NH3 with 2-oxoglutarate to pro -
duce a second molecule of l-glutamic acid on the other 
hand. The small subunit transfers electrons from the co-
substrate NADPH. The SNP may interfere with binding 
of glutamine according to our inspection of the struc -
ture by Phyre2, CUPSAT and COACH-D [42, 53, 60]. 
Currently, it is unknown how the amino acid exchange 
E686Q in the large subunit of GOGAT supports faster 
glutarate production by the strains analysed here. Since it 
is known that at high  NH3 concentrations (up to 40 mM) 
GS/GOGAT compensates for the lack of GDH [25], it is 
conceivable that the GOGAT mutant  GltBE686Q is active 
at higher nitrogen concentrations. The media used here 
contains 468 mM  NH3, which is particularly relevant in 
the early growth and production phase. RNAseq analy -
sis revealed higher expression of genes belonging to the 
AmtR regulon of nitrogen starvation in GluA T5 and the 
parental strain GluA T0 than in GluA T7, which carries 
 GltBE686Q (Additional file 2: Tables S1 and S2). Binding to 
operator DNA by homodimeric AmtR is not released by 
a small-molecule effector, but by GlnK when adenylylated 
at tyrosine residue 51 [61], likely in a 6:6 stoichiometric 
 (AmtR2)3–(GlnK3)2 complex [62]. The adenylation status 
of PII-type signal transduction protein GlnK is controlled 
by adenyltransferase GlnD under nitrogen starvation, 
which is most likely perceived as ammonium limitation 
[63]. Thus, ammonium starvation is less pronounced or 
less perceived in the  GltBE686Q carrying mutant GluA 
T7 than in the native GltB carrying strains GluA T0 
and GluA T5. Besides possible effects due to transcrip -
tional and post-translational regulation, the higher Km of 
 GltBE686Q for glutamine as compared to native GltB may 
provide a clue why  GltBE686Q performed better regard -
ing glutarate production. GOGAT competes with the 
transaminases GabT and PatA for the substrate 2-oxo -
glutarate, and according to the BRENDA database the 
Km for 2-oxoglutarate is lower for GOGAT from C. glu -
tamicum subsp. flavum  (0.06  mM) than for GabT from 
P. aeruginosa (0.75 mM) and PatA from E. coli (19 mM). 
Thus, these kinetic parameters suggest that GOGAT 
may outcompete the transaminases used in the syn -
thetic glutarate pathway. The variant  GltBE686Q selected 
by ALE showed a two-fold higher Km for glutamine, the

other substrate of GOGAT. Thus, this mutation likely 
favors a higher ratio of 2-oxoglutarate conversion via 
the transaminases, which is in line with the observed 
increase in glutarate productivity. However, it has to be 
noted that while nitrogen-replete E. coli cells show rela -
tively low intracellular glutamine (0.2 to 0.5  mM) and 
2-oxoglutarate (0.1 to 0.9  mM) concentrations [64], C. 
glutamicum has been described to accumulate about 
10  mM glutamine under nitrogen-replete conditions 
[65]. Future research will have to unravel the mechanism 
and to distinguish whether nitrogen metabolism and/or 
regulation is altered due to  GltBE686Q.
Two changes affected expression and activities of the 
heterologous 5AVA amino transferase GabT and glutar -
ate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase GabD: the amino acid 
exchange P134L in GabD led to higher combined GabD-
GabT in  vitro activity in crude extracts and a higher 
PCN of plasmid pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z) Δ21bp-gabTDP134L 
that differed from pEC-XT99A-gabTD P134L by a 21  bp 
off-frame deletion in the antibiotic resistance marker 
tetA(Z). The first change,  GabDP134L, accelerated growth 
and increased the glutarate titer by about two fold to 
0.12 ± 0.00  h−1 and 45 ± 2 mM, respectively. The second 
change, pEC-XT99A-tetA(Z) Δ21bp-gabTDP134L, improved 
the growth rate to 0.14 ± 0.00   h−1 (compare isogenic 
strains GluA RG2 and GluA RG3 in Fig.  4). Although the 
glutarate titer was not increased, the volumetric produc -
tivity was increased (Fig.  4). 5AVA remained a by-prod -
uct of accelerated, flux enforced glutarate production. 
In the fermentations performed in batch and fed-batch 
mode, it was demonstrated that as long as residual glu -
cose is present 5AVA accumulated, but once it is neg -
ligible, only glutarate accumulated. C. glutamicum 
possesses the native operon gabTDP  on its chromosome 
and its expression is reduced in the presence of glucose, 
gluconate, and myo -inositol, presumably via the cAMP-
dependent global regulator GlxR, for which a binding site 
is present downstream of the gabT  transcriptional start 
site [66]. Thus, while plasmid-borne expression of ldcC, 
patD and patA was sufficient for conversion of lysine to 
5AVA, plasmid-borne expression of gabTD  was limiting 
for conversion of 5AVA to glutarate and glutarate pro -
duction benefitted from expression of the native gabTDP  
from the chromosome. Since flux enforcement by gdh  
deletion is more efficient when coupled to one transam -
ination reaction rather than to two [8], either pathways 
with just one transamination reaction shall be used or 
flux enforcement has to be accentuate further, e.g., by 
combined deletion or attenuation of gdh and gltBD.
With the aim to ensure appropriate industrially appli -
cable purification, reactive extraction followed by a reac -
tive re-extraction step proved to be a successful recovery 
strategy for glutarate produced by fermentation. Reactive 
extraction systems containing any amount of T-C6 or 
high amounts of T-C8 (molar ratio of T-C8/glutar -
ate = 6/1 or higher) led to the formation of a third solid 
phase. Increasing the polarity of the organic phase by 
addition of 1-dodecanol as (polar) modifier successfully 
prevented the third-phase formation. An optimal reac -
tive extraction system was identified containing T-C6 
as amine extractant at a molar ratio of 9/1 including 
10  wt% of 1-dodecanol as polar modifier in the organic 
phase. Within these experiments, a yield of 58.1% was 
achieved. Only small amounts of l-glutamic acid and 
5-aminovalerate were co-extracted within this step. Reac-
tive re-extraction using both WSA’s led to maximum re-
extraction yield of 99%.
One reason that a full recovery of glutarate from fer -
mentation broth could not be achieved in the initial 
reactive extraction step is the presence of strong elec -
trolytes like chloride ions in the aqueous phase, which 
significantly lowers the reactive extraction performance 
[41, 67]. Other acids as e.g. hydrochloric acid can form 
complexes with the amine extractant as well, hence com -
peting with the carboxylic acid for the amine extractant 
and lowering reactive extraction yield [67, 68]. Previous 
studies showed that the effect of sulfate ions on reactive 
extraction yield of carboxylic acids is less pronounced 
[41, 67]. Therefore, choosing sulfuric acid in this study 
to adjust the pH of the aqueous phase before reactive 
extraction was beneficial for the efficiency of the process. 
Furthermore, it was shown in experiments investigating 
reactive extraction of carboxylic acids from fermentation 
broth, that exchanging the ammonium source  NH4Cl for 
ammonium sulfate ((NH 4)2SO4) did increase the extrac -
tion yield significantly [41]. Therefore, this approach 
could lead to higher extraction yields for glutarate as well 
and should be considered in future studies as omitting 
chloride in CGXII did not affect glutarate production in 
the evolved strain (Additional file  1: Figure S3). In con -
clusion, recovery of glutarate from fermentation broth 
applying the reactive extraction/reactive re-extraction 
concept for the purification of carboxylic acids was suc -
cessful, hence adding to the feasibility of the industrial 
applicability of glutarate production by C. glutamicum.

1100  rpm and 30°C with filling volume of 1000  μL. To 
omit chloride from the culture medium,  CaCl2 ×  2H2O 
was substituted in equimolar amounts by calcium ace -
tate, whereas  NiCl2 ×  6H2O was  replaced by  NiSO4. For 
the titration of tetracycline the washed cells were inoc -
ulated to an initial  OD600 of 0.5 and the cultivation was

ALE experiments
ALE of C. glutamicum strain GluA T0 was carried out 
in repeated batch cultivations. Therefore, the replicate 
with the highest cell density in the exponential phase 
was transferred to fresh CGXII minimal medium supple -
mented with 40 g  L−1 glucose as a sole carbon source and 
1 mM IPTG for induction with an initial  OD600 of 1. The 
experiment was performed in 10  mL Duetz microtiter 
plates (MTPs) with culture volumes of 3 mL at 220 rpm 
and 30°C  in an Ecotron ET25-TA-RC (Infors HT, Eins -
bach, Germany). Growth was monitored by determi -
nation of the  OD600 with a V-1200 Spectrophotometer 
(VWR, Radnor, PA, USA).
Molecular biology methods
Isolation of genomic DNA of C. glutamicum and classi -
cal methods which include plasmid isolation, molecu -
lar cloning and heat-shock transformation of E. coli and 
electroporation of C. glutamicum were performed as 
described previously [71, 79]. ALLin HiFi DNA Polymer-
ase (HighQu, Kraichtal, Germany) was used to amplify 
DNA sequences with genomic DNA as template. The oli -
gonucleotides which were used as primers in this study 
are listed in Table  4. For the construction of the deletion 
vector the genomic flanking regions of gltB were ampli -
fied from genomic DNA of C. glutamicum ATCC13032 
using the primer pairs JJ49/JJ50 and JJ51/JJ52. The PCR 
products were purified and linked by crossover PCR and 
the resulting product was cloned as XbaI/HindIII restric -
tion site in pK19mobsacB. For introduction of the point 
mutation, plasmid pK19mobsacB [78] digested with 
BamHI was assembled with amplified DNA fragments 
flanking 500 bp upstream and downstream the mutation 
site of the gene gltB (cg0229) using Gibson Assembly. The 
SNP was introduced over the primers GltBB and GltBC. 
The constructed suicide vectors were transferred into E. 
coli S17-1 to follow a protocol for gene deletion routinely 
applied [70]. For the construction of pEKEx3-gltBD and 
pEKEx3-gltBE686QD the DNA sequence was amplified 
from the genomic DNA of C. glutamicum ATCC13032 
and GSLA2G::gltBE686Q, respectively. The amplified genes 
were assembled with pEKEx3 digested with BamHI using 
Gibson assembly.
Quantification of amino acids, carbohydrates and organic 
acids by HPLC
The quantification of extracellular amino acids and their 
derivatives, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids in the 
cultivation medium was performed with a high-per -
formance liquid chromatography system (1200 series, 
Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Böblingen, 
Germany). After centrifugation of 1  mL of cell cultures 
at 14,000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was stored at 
− 20 °C prior to analysis. Analysis of l-lysine, 5AVA and 
the diamine cadaverine was performed by an automatic 
pre-column derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde 
(OPA) and separated on a reversed phase HPLC using 
pre- and main column (LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5μ,

with l-asparagine as internal standard [80]. The elu -
tion buffer gradient consisted of 0.25% Na-acetate (pH 
6.0), as the polar phase and methanol as the nonpolar 
phase [77]. Detection of the fluorescent derivatives was 
carried out with a fluorescence detector with an excita -
tion wavelength of 230 nm and an emission wavelength 
of 450  nm. Glutarate and glucose concentrations were 
measured with an amino exchange column (Aminex, 
300 mm × 8 mm, 10 μm particle size, 25 Å pore diame -
ter, CS Chromatographie Service GmbH) under isocratic 
conditions with 5 mM sulphuirc acid as described previ -
ously with a flow of 0.8  mL   min−1 [81]. The substances 
were detected with a refractive index detector (RID 
G1362A, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) and a diode 
array detector (DAD G1315B, 1200 series, Agilent Tech -
nologies) at 210 nm.
Coupled in vitro activity of GabT and GabD
The apparent activities of GABA transaminase GabT 
and succinate semialdehyde oxidoreductase GabD were 
assayed in combination by monitoring NADPH for -
mation after the addition of 5AVA. Pellets from E. coli 
strains were obtained from cultivations in 50 mL LB sup -
plemented with 1 mM IPTG and 5 µg   mL−1 tetracycline. 
The pellets were washed in 20  mL 50  mM phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm 
and 4  °C, and resuspended in 1  mL of lysis buffer 
(50  mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 9% glycerol and 
1  mM DTT). Cells were disrupted by sonication (cycle. 
0.5, amplitude of 55%, on ice) for 2  min. To remove 
cells debris, centrifugation was performed for 1  h at 
14,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was used for meas-
uring the apparent enzyme activities. The 1 mL assay mix 
contained 150  mM phosphate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.1  mM 
pyridoxal-5′-phophate, 1  mM  NADP+, 15  mM 2-oxo -
glutarate, and 0.5  mg   mL−1 crude extract. To compare 
the different GabD variants, glutarate was added in dif -
ferent concentrations of 0 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM 
and 40 mM, respectively. The reaction was started by the 
addition of 20  mM 5AVA. Protein concentrations were 
determined with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad Labo -
ratories, Hercules, CA, United States) using BSA (bovine 
serum albumin) as standard. The formation of NADPH 
was monitored photometrically at 340 nm and 30 °C for 
3  min using a Shimadzu UV-1202 spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany).
In vitro activity of GltBD
The apparent activity of GOGAT at different glutamine 
concentrations was assayed by monitoring  NADP+ for -
mation after the addition of glutamine. Pellets of C. glu -
tamicum strains were harvested from a 50  mL CGXII 
minimal culture supplemented with 40  g   L−1 glucose, 
1 mM IPTG and appropriate antibiotics in the exponen -
tial phase. The pellets were washed with 20 mL 100 mM 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and centrifuged for 10 min at 
4000 rpm and 4 °C, and resuspended in 2 mL of 100 mM 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cells were disrupted by soni -
cation (cycle. 0.5, amplitude of 55%, on ice) for 9  min. 
To remove cells debris, centrifugation was performed 
for 1  h at 14,000  rpm and 4  °C. The supernatant was 
used for measuring the apparent enzyme activities. The 
1  mL assay mix contained 100  mM phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.0), 1.5  mM NADPH, 35  mM 2-oxoglutarate, and 
0.5 mg  mL−1 crude extract [82]. To determine the Km glu-
tamine was added in different concentrations of 0  mM, 
0.1 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 3.5 mM, 5 mM 
and 10  mM, respectively. The reaction was started by 
the addition of glutamine. Protein concentrations were 
determined with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad Labora -
tories, Hercules, CA, United States) using bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) as standard. The formation of  NADP+ 
was monitored photometrically at 340 nm and 30 °C for 
3  min using a Shimadzu UV-1202 spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany).
Fermentative production
A baffled bioreactor with total a volume of 3.7  L was 
used (KLF, Bioengineering AG, Switzerland). Three six-
bladed Rushton turbines were placed on the stirrer axis 
with a distance from the bottom of the reactor of 6, 12, 
and 18 cm. The aspect ratio of the reactor was 2.6:1.0 and 
the stirrer to reactor diameter ratio was 0.39. Automatic 
control of the stirrer speed between 400 and 1500  rpm 
kept the relative dissolved oxygen saturation at 30%. A 
constant airflow of 2 NL   min−1 was maintained from the 
bottom through a sparger, corresponding to an aeration 
of 1 vvm. The pH was kept constant at 7.0 ± 0.1 by auto-
matic addition of phosphoric acid (10% (v/v)) and potas -
sium hydroxide (4 M). The temperature was maintained 
at 30 °C. To prevent foaming 0.6 mL   L−1 of the antifoam 
agent AF204 (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was 
added and a mechanical foam breaker was present to 
serve as an additional foam control. The initial working 
volume of 2 L was inoculated to an  OD600 of 1.2 from a 
shake flask pre-culture in CGXII minimal medium sup -
plemented with 40 g   L−1 glucose and 1 mM IPTG. Sam -
ples were collected by an autosampler and cooled down 
to 4 °C until further use.
The fed-batch fermentation was performed with a head 
space overpressure of 0.4  bar and 42  g   L−1 MOPS was 
added to the medium. The feed (ρ = 1.1 ± 0.0  kg   m−3) 
consisted of 150  g   L−1 glucose, 40  g   L−1  (NH4)2SO4, 
1  mL  L−1 PCA-solution (30  mg   mL−1 of 3,4-dihydroxy -
benzoic acid), 0.55  mL   L−1 of filtered  FeSO4-citrate

solution (20 g  L−1  FeSO4 heptahydrate and 20.2 g  L−1 cit-
rate monohydrate), 0.4  mL   L−1 filtered vitamin solution 
(0.3 g  L−1 biotin, 0.5 g  L−1 thiamin hydrochloride, 2 g  L−1 
calcium pantothenate, and 0.6  g   L−1 nicotinamide) and 
1  mM IPTG as described before [16, 83]. It was started 
when the  pO2 fell below 30% for the first time. The feed 
solution was applied when the  pO2 surpassed 60%. Fur -
ther feed was only added, when the pO2 decreased to 
30% after addition of the feed solution to prevent over -
saturation with glucose.
Whole‑genome sequencing
For isolation of genomic DNA (gDNA), C. glutamicum 
GluA T0 and the evolved strains GluA T5 and GluA T7 
were cultivated in triplicates in BHIS in 100  mL baffled 
shake flasks at 120  rpm and 30  °C overnight. 10  mL of 
the cultures were harvested and gDNA was isolated using 
the NucleoSpin Microbial DNA kit for DNA, RNA and 
protein purification (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) 
according to the manufacturer’s manual.
Whole-genome sequencing was performed with iso -
lated gDNA from the originating strain C. glutamicum 
GluA T0 and the evolved strains GluA T5 and GluA T7. 
Quality of isolated gDNA was analyzed using a spec -
trophotometer (NanoDrop ®, ND-1000). The Illumina 
TruSeq DNA PCR-free high-throughput library prep 
kit (Illumina Inc.) was used according to manufactures 
instructions and Illumina genome sequencing was per -
formed with a HiSeq1500 sequencer system 2 × 250  nt 
PE v2 HT rapid mode with 0.5% flow cell loading per 
sample (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The raw sequencing 
data are available via BioProject: PRJNA691520. Trim -
ming and mapping of NGS raw reads was performed with 
Bowtie2 [84] paired end mode on the reference genome 
C. glutamicum ATCC13032 (CP025533) and plasmids 
(pVWEx1-ldcC; pEKEx3-patDA; pEC-XT99A-gabT -
DP134L) [13] using standard settings. Mapped sequencing 
data was imported in the software readXplorer v.2.2.3 
[85] for visualization and SNP detection. SNP detec -
tion in all coding sequences of C. glutamicum was per -
formed in readXplorer using 90% minimum percentage 
of variation and a  minimum of 20 Reads as thresholds. 
Additionally, genomic DNA and plasmids of the strains 
were sequenced using Nanopore sequencing technology 
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies Oxford, UK [ONT]). 
Libraries were prepared with ONT SQK-LSK109 ligation 
sequencing kit and long read sequencing was performed 
on the ONT GridION platform with an R9.4.1 flow cell. 
Base calling and demultiplexing were performed using 
Guppy v3.1.5. Nanopore data were processed with Canu 
v1.8 [86] (parameters: genomeSize = 3.5  m, rawError -
Rate = 0.3, correctedErrorRate = 0.1). Canu contigs were 
polished with Racon v1.3.3 [87] (parameters: − c 6, 
− m 8, − x − 6, − g − 8, − w 500), followed by medaka 
v0.11.0 [88] (parameters: − b 100, − m r941_min_high_
g303) and Pilon v1.22 [89]. Unicycler v0.4.6 [90] was used 
for hybrid assembly of the Illumina data and the contigs 
from the polished Canu assembly. The unicycler assem -
blies were then analyzed via mauve [91] used for genome 
comparisons.
RNA isolation, cDNA library preparation and sequencing
To explore differences in the gene expression in the 
evolved strains, C. glutamicum GluA T0, GluA T5 and 
GluA T7 were grown in CGXII minimal medium with 
40  g  L−1 glucose supplemented with 1  mM IPTG using 
three glycerol stocks of the respective strains. 1  mL of 
exponentially growing cells  (OD600 ~ 6.0) were harvested 
by centrifugation (14,000×g, 1 min) and kept at − 80 °C. 
RNA isolation, purification and quality control was per -
formed as described [92] and the high quality RNA (RNA 
integrity number > 9.0) was kept at − 80 °C until further 
use. Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Bacteria) from Illu -
mina (San Diego, CA, USA) was used to remove the 
ribosomal RNA molecules from the isolated total RNA. 
Preparation of cDNA libraries were performed accord -
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions of TruSeq stranded 
mRNA Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Subsequently, 
each cDNA library was sequenced on a HiSeq1500 
(2 × 70  nt PE rapid v2) and NextSeq 500 (2 × 75  nt PE 
mid output v2.5) Sequencer system (Illumina, San Diego, 
USA). The software Bowtie2 [84] was used for mapping 
to the respective genome Corynebacterium glutamicum 
ATCC13032 (CP025533) and plasmids (pVWEx1-ldcC; 
pEKEx3-patDA; pEC-XT99A-gabTDP134L) [13]. In order 
to perform differential gene expression analysis DEseq2 
[93] was used as a module of the software ReadX -
plorer(2). Statistically significant expression changes with 
an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and a log2 fold change > 1.0 or 
< − 1.0 were regarded as true. The transcriptomic data 
have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at 
EMBL-EBI1 under accession number E-MTAB-10025.
Reactive extraction of glutarate
A detailed description of the applied method for the 
recovery of carboxylic acids from fermentation broth 
via complex formation with amine extractants can be 
found in literature [41, 55, 94]. The following is a brief 
description: using water immiscible amine extractants in 
a hydrophobic organic solvent, the undissociated carbox-
ylic acid is first extracted (via complex formation) into 
an organic phase at a pH value of the fermentation broth 
which is lower than the  pKa of the acid. Subsequently, the 
carboxylic acid is re-extracted into an aqueous phase via 
complex formation with water-soluble amine extractants.

In the case that a third, solid phase is formed because 
of a low polarity of the organic phase, a modifier can be 
added to the organic phase in order to increase the polar-
ity and thus prevent third-phase formation.
In this work, tri-n-hexylamine (T-C6, 96% purity), pur -
chased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and 
tri-n-octylamine (T-C8, 97% purity), purchased from TCI 
(Tokyo, Japan), were applied to recover glutarate from 
the fermentation broth (extraction step). For re-extrac -
tion, the water-soluble primary amines n-propylamine 
(M-C3, 98% purity) from Sigma-Aldrich and n-butyl -
amine (M-C4, 99% purity) purchased from AlfaAesar 
(Karlsruhe, Germany) were applied as amine extractants. 
The ester ethyl oleate (AlfaAesar, techn., 70%) was chosen 
as hydrophobic organic solvent, providing the advantage 
of being biocompatible [55]. If necessary, 1-dodecanol 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 98% purity) was added as suitable modi -
fier to the organic phase (for extraction systems with a 
third phase). Prior to the reactive extraction, in order to 
obtain glutaric acid in its undissociated form (desired for 
complex formation), the pH of the fermentation broth 
was adjusted to 2.5 (<  pKa1 = 4.32 of glutarate) using 
highly concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, from Merck, 
Darmstadt, Germany).
Reactive extraction and reactive re-extraction experi -
ments were conducted in 15  mL centrifugal tubes with 
sealed screw caps manufactured by VWR International 
(Radnor, PA, USA). The phase ratio was 1/1 aqueous to 
organic ( V aq /V org ) with a total volume of 5 mL (4 mL in 
case of re-extraction) of each experiment. The chemi -
cals were added in the order fermentation broth, solvent, 
modifier (if necessary) and amine extractant (re-extrac -
tion: water, amine extractant, organic phase after reactive 
extraction) and each compound was weighed using a BP 
301S (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) mass balance with 
an accuracy of ± 1  mg. The centrifugal tubes were then 
transferred to an overhead shaker (Trayster Digital from 
IKA, Staufen, Germany) and mixed for 24 h at T = 25 °C 
to ensure equilibration of the system. Centrifugation of 
the 15 mL tubes was done in a Centrifuge 5804 R Eppen -
dorf (Hamburg, Germany) equipped with an A4-44 rotor 
at 3500 rpm and a temperature of T = 25 °C for 15 min. 
For analysis of the aqueous phase, a sample of the aque -
ous phase after reactive extraction was taken by punch -
ing a cannula through the bottom of the centrifugal tube.
Concentration analysis of the aqueous phase was per -
formed via HPLC with an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC 
(Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a Nucleogel Sugar 810 H, 
7.8 × 300  mm column including the corresponding 
guard column (both by Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Ger -
many). The temperature was kept constant at T = 35 °C. 
5 mM sulfuric acid was used as eluent at a volume flow 
of 0.6 mL  min−1. Detection was realized with a refractive 
index detector. All aqueous samples were filtrated using 
a poly-ethersulphonate syringe filter (0.45 µm) by VWR 
International (Radnor, USA) and diluted with eluent at 
a ratio of 1/5 ( V aq /V eluent ) before analysis. The injected 
sample amount was 5 µL.
The reactive extraction yield XRE was calculated using 
Eq. 1, where naq1
GA,0 is the molar amount of glutarate in the 
fermentation broth before reactive extraction, whereas 
naq1
GA  is the molar amount of glutarate in the aqueous 
phase after reactive extraction.
The molar amount of glutarate in the organic phase 
after reactive extraction norg
GA,0  was calculated via mass 
balance of glutarate in the aqueous phase.
The re-extraction yield XREEX was calculated using 
Eq. 2, in which naq2
GA  is the molar amount of glutarate in 
the aqueous phase after re-extraction and norg
GA  is the 
molar amount of glutarate in the organic phase after 
reactive extraction and before re-extraction.
