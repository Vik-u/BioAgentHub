Abstract
The gene encoding an NAD +-dependent, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (3HIBDH-IV) from Pseudomonas denitrificans
ATCC 13867 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE3) and characterized to understand its physiological
relevance in the degradation of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity
to other 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase isozymes (3HIBDHs) of P. denitrificansATCC 13867. A comparison of 3HIBDH-
IV with its relevant enzymes along with molecular docking studies suggested that Lys171, Asn175 and Gly123 are important
for its catalytic function on 3-hydroxyacids. The recombinant 3HIBDH-IV was purified to homogeneity utilizing a Ni-NTA-HP
resin column in high yield. 3HIBDH-IV was very specific to ( S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, but also catalyzed the oxidation of 3-HP
to malonate semialdehyde. The specific activity and half-saturation constant ( K
m) for 3-HP at 30 uC and pH 9.0 were
determined to be 17 U/mg protein and 1.0 mM, respectively. Heavy metals, such as Ag + and Hg2+, completely inhibited the
3HIBDH-IV activity, whereas dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid increased its activity 1.5–
1.8-fold. This paper reports the characteristics of 3HIBDH-IV as well as its probable role in 3-HP degradation.

Introduction
Several strains of Escherichia coli were recently developed to
produce the commercially important chemical, 3-hydroxypro-
pionic acid (3-HP), from glycerol [1,2]. Although the final titer
was high (,39 g/L), the requirement of an exogenous supply of
high-cost coenzyme B
12 by one essential enzyme, glycerol
dehydratase, was the major obstacle to the use ofE. coli in the
commercial production of 3-HP. One strategy to overcome this
limitation is to construct a 3-HP synthetic route in a host
microorganism, such as Pseudomonas denitrificans , which can
naturally synthesize coenzyme B
12 under aerobic conditions
[3]. On the other hand, when the production of 3-HP in
genetically modified P. denitrificans was attempted, the 3-HP
produced was degraded in the late exponential growth phase
(unpublished results).
The degradation of 3-HP in P. denitrificans was attributed to
the existence of 3-HP degradative enzymes and pathways.
According to the literature, 3-HP can be degraded via two
routes: 1) malonate semialdehyde, which is generated by 3-
hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.59), and 2) 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA, which is produced by either 3-hydro-
xypropionyl-CoA synthetase (EC: 6.2.1.36) or 3-hydroxyisobu-
tyryl-CoA hydrolase (EC: 3.1.2.4) (www.keggpathway.com)
[427]. Malonate semialdehyde is further converted to acetyl-
CoA and enters the main stream of the energy metabolism,
whereas 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA is converted to acryloyl-CoA
and enters amino acid metabolism [4,5]. In P. denitrificans ,
however, 3-HP degradation and enzymes, such as 3-HP
dehydrogenase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase or 3-
hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase, have not been reported.
In an effort to develop an efficientP. denitrificans for coenzyme
B
12-free 3-HP production, we examined the enzymatic degra-
dation of 3-HP. Because 3-HP dehydrogenase has not been
identified inP. denitrificans and otherPseudomonas species, a similar
but relatively well studied enzyme, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate de-
hydrogenase (3HIBDH), was chosen and examined for 3-HP
degradation. 3HIBDH catalyzes the reversible oxidation of 3-
hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB, C
4H7O3) to methylmalonate semi-
aldehyde (C 4H6O3), which is an intermediary metabolite of
valine degradation. Furthermore, a few 3HIBDHs were
reported to oxidize several 3-hydroxyacids, including 3-HP
[729]. P. denitrificans has four putative isozymes of 3-HIBDHs,
namely 3HIBDH-I, II, III and IV, according to a search using
the gene encoding 3HIBDH of P. fluorescens Pf5 ATCC BAA-
477 (accession no., AAY90588) [10]. Among these isozymes

3HIBDH-IV was chosen for detailed investigation in this study,
because it was expected to play a major role in 3-HP
degradation. 3HIBDH-IV was cloned, expressed and purified
from the recombinant strain E. coli 3HIBDH4 and its kinetic
characteristics on a range of substrates, including 3-HP, were
examined. The probable role of 3HIBDH-IV in 3-HP
degradation is also discussed.

New England Bio-labs (Beverly, MA, USA). The pQE-80L vector,
miniprep and DNA gel purification kits were purchased from
Qiagen (Mannheim, Germany). The Ni-NTA-HP resin column
was obtained from GE Healthcare (Sweden). 3-HP was acquired
from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd., Japan (TCI America). Unless
otherwise indicated, all other chemicals, cofactors and enzymes
were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Real-time PCR for Quantification of mRNA
P. denitrificans ATCC 13867 was grown in M9 medium with
supplementation of 30 mM 3-HP and without supplementation of
3-HP, both under aerobic condition at 37uC and 200 rpm in an
orbital incubator shaker. One milliliter of culture, contained
2610
8 cells, was collected during exponential growth phase into
the vials containing two volumes of RNA protect reagent (Qiagen,
Inc., USA). The culture mix was centrifuged at 5000 6g for
10 min. Total RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Qiagen,
Inc., USA). Four microgram of total RNA was synthesized into
first strand cDNA in a 20mL reaction using SuperScript III first-
strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, USA). Real-time PCR was
performed according to SYBR green method [11] in a 20mL
reaction volume using Real-Time PCR system 7300 (Applied
Biosystems, USA) under the following thermal cycling: predena-
turing at 95uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 5 s, 62uC
for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s. The reaction mixture contained
200 ng of cDNA, 10mL of 2x SYBRpremix Ex Taq(TaKaRa, Bio.
Inc., Japan), 0.4 mL of 50x ROX reference dye (TaKaRa, Bio.
Inc., Japan) and 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers
corresponding to the genes 3hibdhI, 3hibdhII, 3hibdhIII, and
3hibdhIV. The primers used for amplification of3hibdhs are listed
in Table 1. TherpoD gene, which encodes sigma factor 70 was
used as reference gene. PCR efficiencies of all primers were
experimentally determined and found to be suitable for reliable
copy number quantification. Relative mRNA amounts were
determined by theDDCT method as described previously [12].
Cloning of 3 hibdhIV
Table 1 lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study.
E. coli BL21 (DE3) served as a host for developing the strain,
whereas E. coliXL1-blue was used for routine cloning and plasmid
maintenance. The LB medium was used for the routine culture
and growth ofE. coli. Ampicillin at 100 mg/L was added to the
culture media. Gene manipulations were carried out using
standard methods [13]. The plasmid pQE-80L was used to clone
the 3hibdhIV gene in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The 59 and 39 terminal
DNA sequences of the 3hibdhIV gene of P. denitrificans ATCC
13867 were used to design the following primers: upstream,
59TTA
GGATCCATGCGCATCGGTTTCATCGGACTCGG-
CAACATG-39, and downstream, 5 9- TAC AAGCTTT-
CAGCCCTGCTCGTACAGCTTCACAATGGCTGAG-39
(the underlined nucleotides indicate BamHI and HindIII sites,
respectively). These primers were used to amplify the coding
region of the 3 hibdhIV gene from the genomic DNA of P.
denitrificans by PCR. The amplified PCR fragment was ligated into
the pGEM-T vector and transformed intoE. coli XL1-blue. The
resulting plasmid, pT3HIBDH4, was sequenced by Cosmotech
Co., Ltd., Korea. The pT3HIBDH4 plasmid was then digested
with the BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes, and the
restriction fragment was sub-cloned into the pQE-80L expression
vector. The resulting expression plasmid pQ3HIBDH4 containing
the 3 hibdhIV gene with the His-tag at the N-terminus was
transformed into E. coli BL21 to yield E. coli (pQ3HIBDH4),
which is referred to as the SH-3HIBDH4 strain.
Expression and Purification of Recombinant 3HIBDH-IV
The SH-3HIBDH4 strain was grown in LB medium supple-
mented with 100 mg/L ampicillin. The cells were grown

experiments.

aerobically in 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 350 mL of
medium at 30uC and 200 rpm in an orbital incubator shaker.
The cells were induced at,0.6 OD600 with 0.5 mM isopropyl-
beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated at 25uC for
10 h. The cells were then harvested and centrifuged at 10,0006g
for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and resuspended in the binding buffer
(20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and
20 mM imidazole). The resuspended cells were disrupted using
a French Pressure Cell (FA-078A, Thermo Electron Corp.;
Waltham, MA, USA) at 1,250 psi. The cell lysate was centrifuged
at 25,0006ga t4uC for 30 min to remove the particulate fraction.
The soluble fraction was subjected to purification under non-
denaturing conditions by Ni-affinity chromatography using a Ni-
NTA-HP resin column (17-5248-01; GE Healthcare, Sweden).
The eluents from the column was pooled and dialyzed using
a 10 kDa cutoff membrane to remove the salts. The resulting
enzyme extract was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions,
as described by Laemmli [14], and the extract was stored at
280uC.
Determination and Characterization of 3HIBDH-IV
Activity
The 3HIBDH-IV activity was measured using the method
described by Rougraff et al. [15]. The reaction mixture containing
100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 0.2mg/mL enzyme and 3 mM
3-HP was incubated at 30uC for 5 min. The reaction was initiated
by adding 2 mM NAD(P)
+. The enzyme activity was determined
by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H at 340 nm.
The amount of NAD(P)H formed was determined using a molar
extinction coefficient (De340) of 6.22610
3 M21 cm21. One unit
of 3HIBDH-IV activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
needed to reduce 1mmol of NAD(P)
+ to NAD(P)H in one minute.
All enzyme activities were determined in triplicate and the values
indicated are the triplicate measurement of the same enzyme
preparation (mean values, n = 3).
The effects of temperature and pH on the 3HIBDH-IV activity
were determined using 3-HP as a substrate and NAD
+ as
a cofactor. The temperature effects were examined at pH 9.0 in
the range of 25 to 50uC using a temperature-controlled double
beam spectrophotometer (Lambda 20, PerkinElmer; Norwalk,

CT, USA). The pH effects were determined in the range of pH 6.0
to 10 at 30uC using 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 627), Tris-
HCl (pH 729) and Glycine-NaOH buffers (pH 9210.6). The
effects of metal ions and other chemicals on the 3HIBDH-IV
activity were examined at 30uC and pH 9.0 using 3-HP and
NAD
+ as a substrate and cofactor, respectively. The effect of
positive monovalent light alkali metals (Na+,L i+,K + and NH4
+),
a positive bivalent alkali-earth metal (Mg 2+), transition metals
(Co2+,N i2+,C u2+,Z n2+,F e2+ and Mn2+) and heavy metals (Hg2+
and Ag+), all in the form of chloride-sulfate salts, on the 3HIBDH-
IV activities were evaluated at a 1 mM concentration. The effects
of two disulfide reductants, such as 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and
dithiothreitol (DTT), and the chelating agent ethylenediaminete-
traacetic acid (EDTA) were also evaluated at 1.0 mM. The
substrate specificity of 3HIBDH-IV was determined at 30uC and
pH 9.0 for many different substrates in the presence of NAD
+ or
NADP+ as cofactors. 3-hydroxypropionate, sodium (R)-3-hydro-
xyisobutyrate, sodium ( S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, L-serine, a-
methyl-D,L-serine, methyl-( S)-(+)-3-hydroxyl-2-methylpropionate,
D-glycerate calcium salt dehydrate and methyl-2,2-dimethyl-3-
hydroxypropionate, were used as the substrates in this study. The
kinetics of 3HIBDH-IV for the degradation of 3-HP and several
other organic acids were also examined using NAD+ as a cofactor.
Ten different initial substrate concentrations were tested to
measure the reaction rates. The apparent Michaelis-Menten
constant was determined from the double reciprocal Linewea-
ver-Burk plots of the reaction rate vs. substrate and/or cofactor
concentrations (Figure S1).
Analytical Methods
The cell concentration was determined in a 10-mm-path-length
cuvette using a double-beam spectrophotometer (Lambda 20,
Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). One unit of absorbance at 600 nm
corresponds to 0.3 g dried cell mass per liter. The protein
concentrations in the cell-free extract were determined using the
method described previously [16] on a microtiter plate reader
(1420, Wallac Victor2; PerkinElmer) using bovine serum albumin
as the standard.
Homology Modeling of 3HIBDH-IV
The crystal structures of the human and bacterial 3HIBDHs
templates (PDB ID: 2GF2, 2I9P, 2CKY, 3OBB, and 3Q3C) with
high sequence identity and resolution were obtained using
a BLAST search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB; www.
rcsb.org) using the BLOSUM80 matrix with a gap penalty and
gap extension penalty of 11 and 1, respectively. Table 2 provides
details of the templates, which include the source, identity against
target 3HIBDH-IV and their resolution. A model 3-dimentional
(3D) structure of 3HIBDH-IV was created by comparative
modeling using MODELLER 9v7 program. Briefly, the template
structures were first aligned and superimposed. The resulting
structures were used to align the target sequences of 3HIBDH-IV.
A final alignment check and corrections were performed manually
and 100 models were constructed using the MODELLER 9v7
program with high level optimization. The models were selected
with the lowest probability density function (PDF) energy. The
quality of the model was determined by examining the distribution
of amino acid residues in the Ramachandran plot [17].
Molecular Docking
A molecular docking study was carried out to examine the
binding interaction between 3-HP and modeled 3HIBDH-IV.
The AutoDock4.0 software package was used to run the docking
protocol, as described previously [18]. The protein structure was

prepared by assigning Kollman united-atom charges, solvation
parameters and polar hydrogen atoms. The Gasteiger charge was
added and the non-polar hydrogen atoms merged because the
ligand molecule is not a peptide. The ligand molecule was kept
flexible to rotate freely during the docking search. The active site
residue of serine dehydrogenase, i.e. Lys171, which was reported
previously in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB ID: 3Q3C) [9], was
considered to be the binding site for the modeled 3HIBDH-IV.
The grid box was fixed at the center of the cavity site residue
Lys171. The box size was 40640640 A˚ in the x, y and z axes,
respectively. AutoGrid was used to produce grid maps. The space
between grid points was 0.375 A˚. The Lamarckian genetic
algorithm (LGA) was used to search the conformer. Fifty docking
runs were carried out by clustering analysis using the root-mean-
square deviation (RMSD) of 2.0 A˚ with reference to the starting
geometry of the ligand.
Results
RT-PCR Analysis of 3hibdhs Expression in Wild Type P.
denitrificans ATCC13867
Figure 1 shows the mRNA expression level for 3hibdhI,
3hibdhII, 3hibdhIII and 3hibdhIV in wild type P. denitrificans
ATCC13867 cultured in M9 medium with and without 3-HP
supplementation at 30 mM. The mRNA level of rpoD was
constant regardless of 3-HP supplementation, suggesting that
rpoD was a suitable housekeeping gene. The mRNA level for
3hibdhI was negligible, while that for 3hibdhIV was the highest
among the four 3hibdhs. The presence of 3-HP in the culture
medium enhanced the expression of all 3hibdh genes. The
3hibdhII showed the highest improvement at 11.5 60.9-fold,
followed by 3hibdhI at 7.5 60.7-fold. In comparison, the
improvement of mRNA level for 3hibdhIII or 3hibdhIV in the
presence of 3-HP was less significant. However, despite the
great improvement of expression levels, the mRNA levels for
3hibdhI and 3hibdhII were much lower than that for3hibdhIV.I n
a separate experiment, all four 3hibdhs were introduced into E.
coli and their activity in crude cell extract of the recombinantE.
coli were measured (unpublished). The recombinant with
3hibdhIV showed the highest activity among the four isozymes
(3HIBDH-I, 2.88 U/mg protein; 3HIBDH-II, 2.85 U/mg pro-
tein; 3HIBDH-III, 0.00 U/mg protein; and 3HIBDH-IV,
3.52 U/mg protein). These results suggested that 3HIBDH-IV
should be one of the major enzymes involved in 3-HP
degradation, thus 3HIBDH-IV was chosen for further study.
Sequence Analysis of 3HIBDH-IV and its Comparison with
Other 3HIBDHs
The putative isozymes of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases
(3HIBDH-I to IV) were identified from the entire genome
sequences of P. denitrificans ATCC 13867 using the Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of the available amino
acid sequence of 3HIBDH ofP. fluorescens Pf5 ATCC BAA-477
(accession no., AAY90588) [10]. The amino acid sequences of the
3HIBDHs ofP. denitrificansATCC 13867 were compared with the
structurally well-characterized
L-serine dehydrogenase (PDB ID:
3Q3C_NAD) [9]. The deduced amino acids sequence of
3HIBDH-IV had 53.7% identity with 3Q3C_NAD, whereas that
of 3HIBDH-I had 80.7% identity. Sequence analysis revealed the
presence of four conserved motifs of the 3-hydroxyacid de-
hydrogenase family (Figure 2) [19]. Motifs 1 and 4 encode the
cofactor binding site, and motifs 2 and 3 encode the substrate
binding and catalysis sites, respectively. The residues in the N-
terminal dinucleotide cofactor-binding motif 1
(GXXGXGXMGXXXAXNXXXXG) are 100% conserved in
3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases [19]. This motif also determines
the cofactor specificity (NAD
+ or NADP+). The first seven residues
in motif 2 (DAPVSGGXXXAXXG), substrate binding site were
also highly conserved in the consensus sequences of the putative
3HIBDHs and 3Q3C_NAD
+. Motif 3
(GXXGXGXXXKXXXN/Q) had highly conserved Lys171,
which serves as the catalytic residue. In motif 4 (KDLGXAXD),
which is located near the C-terminus, the first residue Lys240 was
suggested to be surface exposed [19].
Structure Analysis and Docking
A three-dimensional model of 3HIBDH-IV was developed to
understand the structure and functional characteristics (Figure 3a).
The model was generated using multiple templates along with
NAD
+ (Table 2). The predicted model was evaluated by
calculating the main chain RMSD according to its high identity
template structure (PDB ID: 3Q3C_A) and Ramachandran plot.
The RMSD value of the predicted model was 0.77 A˚, suggesting
that the model prediction was satisfactory. Approximately 95% of
the amino acids in the model shown in Figure 3a were distributed
in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, confirmed
the reliability of the predicted model [17].
The docked simulation of 3-HP to the modeled 3HIBDH-IV
produced a single cluster of conformers in the RMSD tolerance of
2.0 A˚ out of 50 runs of LGA. All conformations were clustered
together and favored by producing 50 repeated poses, indicating
the high binding specificity of 3-HP towards the binding site of

3HIBDH-IV. The lowest binding free energy complex of the first
ranked cluster was used for analysis of the binding site residues.
The protein-ligand complex (3HIBDH-IV –3-HP) was formed
with multiple hydrogen bonds by the amino acid residues, Gly123,
Lys171 and Asn175, and one pi-sigma interaction with the Phe235
aromatic ring (Figure 3b). A charged interaction between 3-HP
and NAD
+ located close to the substrate binding site was also
detected. When ( S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate was docked with 3-
HIBDH-IV, the Lys171, Asn175, Ser122 and Gly123 residues had
a direct interaction (Figure 3c). On the other hand, Lys171 and
Ser122 did not show any interaction when (R)-3-hydroxyisobuty-
rate was used (Figure 3d).
Expression, Purification and Activity of Recombinant
3HIBDH-IV
Above sequence analysis and docking studies showed the
possibility that 3-HP can be a substrate for 3HIBDH-IV. To
confirm this, we purified the enzyme and investigated its activity
on 3-HP. E. coli SH-3HIBDH4 was cultured in LB medium at
30uC and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. SDS-PAGE analysis of the

soluble crude cell lysate revealed the presence of the 3HIBDH-IV
protein with an approximate molecular weight of 32 kDa (Figure 4,
lane 2), which corresponds to the predicted size of 3HIBDH-IV.
The target protein, as determined from the SDS-polyacrylamide
gel image, was approximately 26% of the total cellular protein,
and the ratio of the soluble and insoluble fractions of 3HIBDH-4
was 4:1 (data not shown), which means approximately 80% of the
targeted protein was expressed in a soluble form. His-tagged
3HIBDH-IV was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using
a Ni-NTA-HP resin column and the purified protein was observed
as a single band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Figure 4, lane 3).
Activity analysis of the soluble fraction from the crude cell lysate
of SH-3HIBDH4 revealed a maximum specific activity of 3.36 U/
mg protein with 3-HP as the substrate and NAD
+ as the cofactor
(Table 3). On the other hand, the specific activity of the purified
3HIBDH-IV was 16.95 U/mg protein for 3-HP with NAD +,
showing 5-fold purity enrichment, as determined by the specific
activity of 3HIBDH-IV. The protein yield estimated from the
purified extract was approximately 26% of that of the crude cell
extract.
The substrate specificity of 3HIBDH-IV was examined with
various 3-hydroxyacids and amino acids in the presence of NAD
+
as a cofactor. The purified 3HIBDH-IV had limited substrate
specificity, and showed activity on C4 and C3 hydroxy acids, such
as (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, 3-hydroxypropionate and methyl-(S)-
(+)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate, and amino acids, such as L-
serine and methyl-D,L-serine. On the other hand, it did not show
any appreciable activity on (R)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, methyl-2,2-
dimethyl-3-hydroxypropionate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. 3-HP was
the second most preferred substrate next to (S)-3-hydroxyisobuty-
rate for 3HIBDH-IV but its activity on 3-HP was 90% lower than
that with ( S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate. 3HIBDH-IV could also
convert
L-serine, methyl-D,L-serine, and methyl-(S)-(+)-3-hydroxy-
2-methylpropionate to their corresponding products, but less
actively than 3-HP.
Kinetic studies showed that the half-saturation constantK
m of
the purified 3HIBDH-IV for ( S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate was
0.178 mM (Table 4). The specific activity constant (kcat/Km) for
(S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate was 47 times higher than that for 3-HP,
confirming that (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate is the natural substrate
for 3HIBDH-IV inP. denitrificans. The maximum reaction rate for
the oxidation of 3-HP to malonate semialdehyde was 20.243 U/
mg protein using NAD
+ as a cofactor. The Km for 3-HP was
determined to be 1.055 mM, which is approximately 6 times
higher than that for (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate but 16- and 82 times
lower than that for 3-HIBDHs fromBacillus cereus and P. putida
E23, respectively [7,20].
Effect of Temperature and pH on 3HIBDH-IV Activity
The effects of temperature on the activity of 3HIBDH-IV was
examined from 25 to 50uC at pH 9.0 using 3-HP as a substrate
(Figure 5a). The activity of 3HIBDH-IV ofP. denitrificanswas stable
over a wide temperature range between 25 and 50uC. The effect of
pH was examined in the range of 6.0 to 10.6 at 30uC (Figure 5b).
The maximum activity was observed at pH 9.0 with more than
50% of the activity retained at pH 8.3 and 10.3. On the other
hand, the activity was below the detectable level at pH#7.0.
Effect of Metal Ions, Disulfide Reductant, and Other
Compounds on 3HIBDH-IV Activity
The effects of different metal ions and chemical compounds on
the 3HIBDH-IV activity were examined using 3-HP as a substrate
and NAD
+ as a cofactor at pH 9.0 and 30uC (Table 5). Most
monovalent metal ions did not affect the 3HIBDH-IV activity. On
the other hand, some transition metals, such as Cu
2+,Z n2+ and
Fe2+ inhibited the 3HIBDH-IV activity by more than 85%. In
addition, Ag+ and Hg2+ inhibited 3HIBDH-IV completely. In
contrast, the presence of the reducing agents, DTT and 2-ME,
and the chelating agent, EDTA, increased its activity 1.5–1.8-fold.
Discussion
This study examined the 3-HP degrading enzyme in P.
denitrificans ATCC 13867. 3HIBDH was selected as a target
because this enzyme has been reported to catalyze the conversion
of many 3-hydroxyacids, including 3-HP [8,21223]. 3HIBDH-IV
of P. denitrificans ATCC 13867 preferred NAD
+ as a cofactor. No
activity was detected with NADP+. 3HIBDH of a rabbit liver was
reported to have a cofactor preference towards NAD+ [15]. Hawes
et al. [21] suggested that the specific amino acid, either Asp or
Arg, located after 6 hydrophobic residues from the final Gly
residue of the consensus sequence
‘‘GXXGXGXMGXXXAXNXXXXG’’ in motif 1 (Figure 2), is
important for determining the cofactor specificity. They also
suggested that NAD
+ is the preferred cofactor when Asp is present,
whereas NADP+ is preferred when Arg is present [21]. The
presence of Asp29 rather than Arg29 in 3HIBDH-IV of P.
denitrificans ATCC 13867 agrees with this suggestion [21].

3-Hydroxyisobutyrate Dehydrogenase
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e62666
The 3HIBDH-IV activity exhibited strict enantio-selectivity
towards (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate; it did not catalyze the oxidation
of (R)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate. The docking results showed that the
residues, Lys171, Asn175, Ser122 and Gly123, of 3HIBDH-IV
had interactions with (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate (Figure 3c), whereas
Lys171, an important catalytic residue, and Ser122 showed no
interactions when docked with ( R)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate
(Figure 3d). This explains why 3-HIBDH-IV did not catalyze
the oxidation of (R)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate. 3HIBDH of a rabbit
liver was also reported to show a similar preference towards theS-
enantiomer [15]. S-3-hydroxyisobutyrate is an intermediary
metabolite of valine degradation, which connects the metabolisms
of propionate, pyrimidine and citric acid. Therefore, it is expected
that 3HIBDH plays an important role in these metabolisms, in
addition to valine degradation. Few reports have shown that this
enzyme can take 3-HP as an alternate substrate in the absence of
its physiological substrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate [8,21,22,23].
Docking experiments (Figure 3b) revealed four amino acids
residues (Lys171, Asn175, Gly123 and Phe235) of 3HIBDH-IV
to have direct interactions with 3-HP. In the case of L-serine
dehydrogenase PA0743 ofP. aeruginosaPAO1, in addition to these
four amino acids, Ser122 was suggested to play an important role
in substrate binding [9,23]. On the other hand, in 3-HIBDH-IV,
Ser122 had no role when 3-HP was used as a substrate. Gly123 of
substrate binding motif 2 (DAPVS
GGXXXAXXG) had an
interaction with 3-HP at the 3-hydroxyl group. Lys171 and
Asn175 had direct interactions with the carboxylate group of 3-
HP. Lys171 exhibited a charge interaction with the C2O2 group,
whereas Asn175 formed hydrogen bonds with the C2O2 and
C = O of the carboxylate group. The interaction of Lys171 and
Asn175 with the carboxylate of serine for the catalytic activity has
been reported in the crystal structure of serine dehydrogenase,
PA0743 (PDB ID of PA0743 2NAD+ complex: 3Q3C) [9],
suggesting that 3HIBDH-IV shares a similar catalysis mechanism
to the serine dehydrogenase PA0743 of P. aeruginosa PAO1. In
addition, docking experiments enabled an estimation of the
binding free energy for the reaction between the 3HIBDH-IV–
NAD+ complex and 3-HP. The binding energy was23.13 kcal/
mol, suggesting that this binding is thermodynamically favorable.
The inhibitory effects on the 3HIBDH-IV activity of transition
metals, such as Fe2+,Z n2+ and Cu2+, were much stronger than
those of Co2+ and Ni2+, which is similar to that in rabbit liver
3HIBDH [15]. A complete loss of activity in the presence of Hg2+
and Ag+ is not unusual because these metals have strong affinity to
thiol groups and form complexes with the sulfhydryl groups of
sulfur containing amino acids, such as Cys and Met [24]. The
docking result supports the importance of sulfur-containing amino
acid residues, such as Met11 located in the NAD+ binding site.
This suggests that Met11 is important for the function and/or
integrity of the protein confirmation in 3HIBDH-IV.
One of the main objectives of this study was to characterize
the 3-HP degradation activity of 3HIBDH-IV of P. denitrificans
ATCC 13867. According to a resting-cell experiment, the 3-HP
degradation activity of P. denitrificans was approximately
15 mmol/g cell/h at pH 7.0 (data not shown). In comparison,
it was approximately 1,200 mmol/g protein/h with the purified
3HIBDH-IV at pH 9. However, the activity of purified
3HIBDH-IV was very sensitive to pH with almost no activity
observed at pH 7.0. This suggests that the contribution of
3HIBDH-IV to 3-HP degradation in P. denitrificans ATCC
13867 can be insignificant at pH 7.0. To better understand the
physiological significance of 3-HIBDH-IV, more study will be
needed to disrupt the gene encoding 3HIBDH-IV from P.
denitrificans ATCC 13867.
Conclusion
The recombinant 3HIBDH-IV from P. denitrificans ATCC
13867 was cloned, expressed and characterized to understand its
physicochemical properties. The purified 3HIBDH-IV was
enantiospecific to (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate and preferred NAD
+
as a cofactor for its catalytic reaction. 3-HP was a less preferred
substrate than its physiological substrate (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyrate.
Docking experiments revealed four amino acids residues, Lys171,
Asn175, Gly123 and Phe235, to have direct interactions with 3-
HP, and the binding between the enzyme–NAD
+ complex and 3-
HP was thermodynamically favorable (DGu = 23.13 kcal/mol).
The 3-HP degradation activity of 3HIBDH-IV was quite sensitive
to pH. The highest activity was observed at pH 9 but the activity
became almost negligible at pH 7. Experiment involving the
chromosomal deletion of 3 hibdhIV in P. denitrificans to further
elucidate its physiological role in 3-HP degradation and better
understand 3HIBDH-IV are currently underway.
