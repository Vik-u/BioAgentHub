ABSTRACT
Reverse transcriptases (RTs) catalyze the polymerization of DNA from an RNA template. These enzymes were first
discovered in RNA tumor viruses in 1970, but it was not until 1989 that they were found in prokaryotes as a key component
of retrons. Apart from RTs encoded by the ‘selfish’ mobile retroelements known as group II introns, prokaryotic RTs are
extraordinarily diverse, but their function has remained elusive. However, recent studies have revealed that different
lineages of prokaryotic RTs, including retrons, those associated with CRISPR-Cas systems, Abi-like RTs and other yet
uncharacterized RTs, are key components of different lines of defense against phages and other mobile genetic elements.
Prokaryotic RTs participate in various antiviral strategies, including abortive infection (Abi), in which the infected cell is
induced to commit suicide to protect the host population, adaptive immunity, in which a memory of previous infection is
used to build an efficient defense, and other as yet unidentified mechanisms. These prokaryotic enzymes are attracting
considerable attention, both for use in cutting-edge technologies, such as genome editing, and as an emerging research
topic. In this review, we discuss what is known about prokaryotic RTs, and the exciting evidence for their domestication
from retroelements to create specialized defense systems.

INTRODUCTION
According to the central dogma of molecular biology proposed
by Francis Crick in 1958, once genetic information was con-
verted to proteins the flow could not be reversed. However, it
left open the possibility that information could be transferred
from RNA to DNA (Crick1958). The discovery of enzymes capa-
ble of synthesizing DNA from an RNA template demonstrated
this hypothesis (Crick1970). RNA-dependent DNA polymerases,
also known as reverse transcriptases (RTs), were discovered in
1970 in RNA tumor viruses (Baltimore1970; Temin and Mizu-
tani1970), and this finding reshaped existing views on the func-
tioning of all forms of life. In prokaryotes, RTs were discovered
almost 20 years later as a key component of retrons (Lampson
et al.1989; Lim and Maas1989). Currently, prokaryotic RTs dis-
play an extraordinary diversity, with most of them (80%) classi-
fied into three main groups: those encoded by group II introns,
retron/retron-like sequences and diversity-generating retroele-
ments (DGRs). The remaining RT sequences form distinct lin-
eages, including those associated with CRISPR-Cas systems,
abortive phage infection systems (Abi-like) and other unchar-
acterized RTs clustering in the so-called G2L (group-II-like) and
unknowngroups(UG;Toro etal. 2019a).WhiletheRTsofeukary-
otes and viruses have been characterized in detail, it has taken
over 30 years for us to begin to understand the function and
mechanisms of the highly diverse RTs of prokaryotic organisms
(Fig. 1).
Recent investigations have shown that several prokaryotic
RT lineages have evolved to provide new strategies for deal-
ing with phages. Thus, together with Abi-RTs (Fortier, Bouchard
and Moineau 2005; Odegrip, Nilsson and Hagg˚ard-Ljungquist
2006; Durmaz and Klaenhammer2007) and CRISPR-RTs (Kojima
and Kanehisa2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014), searches for
new antiviral immunity systems in defense islands have led to
the discovery of anti-phage properties in a majority of retron
types, and several RTs from uncharacterized groups (Gaoet al.
2020; Millmanet al.2020). The relevance of these enzymes also
lies in the use of different RT lineages as promising tools for
diverse applications, including genome editing, recombination-
mediated genetic engineering applications and the recording of
biological information in bacterial genomes (Schmidt, Cherep-
kova and Platt2018; Belfort and Lambowitz2019; Simon, Elling-
ton and Finkelstein 2019). These potential uses have boosted
interest in these prokaryotic enzymes and their associated sys-
tems.
Group II intron-RTs are the best-characterized in prokary-
otes(FeratandMichel 1993;LambowitzandZimmerly 2011),but
very little is known about their ecological role. These mobile
retroelements are generally considered to be selfish units, but
a few studies have provided evidence to suggest that they
can disrupt other mobile genetic elements (MGE), participat-
ing in host defense against these potentially harmful elements
(Chill´on, Mart´ınez-Abarca and Toro2011;Q u et al.2018). DGRs
provide their hosts with an adaptive advantage due to the great
sequence variation that they cause in a target gene through a
mutagenicreversetranscriptionreaction(Liu etal. 2002;W uetal.
2018). The wide range of functions performed by DGRs have yet
to be elucidated, but they are known to participate in tropism
switching and signaling pathways potentially involved in virus–
host interactions. Thus, our current knowledge of prokaryotic
RTs suggests that they tend to be domesticated to perform
immune functions in the host cell through a wide range of bio-
logical mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. The
overall purpose of this review is to highlight the role of prokary-
otic RTs in immunity to phages and MGEs mediated by selfish
genetic elements to more specialized systems, and to summa-
rize the use of these enzymes in cutting-edge technologies.
Groups of prokaryotic RTs
Group II introns
Group II introns were first identified in the mitochondrial and
chloroplast genomes of lower eukaryotes and plants. They were
not found in prokaryotes until 1993, and their mobility has
sincebeencharacterizedindetail(FeratandMichel 1993;Michel
and Ferat1995; Dai and Zimmerly2003; Toro2003; Lambowitz
and Zimmerly 2004). Group II introns are self-splicing RNAs
that require an ancient form of RT to act as mobile retroele-
ments. This type of RT is the most abundant form in bacteria,
accountingforalmost50%oftotalRTdiversity(Toro etal. 2019a).
Bacterial group II introns generally insert into sequences out-
side of essential genes or into non-essential genes, and show
an extinction–recolonization dynamics suggesting that they are
deleterious to the host (Leclercq and Cordaux2012). With few
exceptions, these introns are typically found as only one or two
copies per genome (Dai and Zimmerly2002). This tendency for
group II introns to be deleterious may drive the domestication
of RT-containing genes, and their conversion into non-mobile
RTs, presumably with novel functions (Fig.2). Indeed, although
group II introns have given rise to more complex retroelements
suchaseukaryoticnon-LTRretrotransposons,theyarealsocon-
sidered the evolutionary ancestors of the spliceosome complex
and the telomerase, which represent greats examples of how
group II introns could generate new functions by domestication
(Box 1).
Group II introns consist of a catalytic RNA, with characteris-
tic conserved 5
′-a n d3′-end sequences, GUGYG and AY, respec-
tively, resembling those of spliceosomal eukaryotic introns, and
an intron-encoded protein (IEP; Lambowitz and Zimmerly2011).
Catalytic intron RNAs have a conserved secondary structure
of 400–800 nts in length and organized into six domains, DI–
VI, radiating from a central ‘wheel’ (Michel, Costa and Westhof
2009). The IEPs, which are encoded in DIV, have several different
domains involved in group II intron retromobility (Lambowitz
and Zimmerly 2004): an N-terminal RT domain, an X domain
or maturase involved in facilitating RNA splicing, a D domain
involved in DNA binding and a metal-dependent DNA endonu-
clease domain of the HNH family that cleaves a target DNA
strand to generate the primer for reverse transcription (San Fil-
ippo and Lambowitz2002). However, a large number of bacterial
group II introns encode IEPs without an endonuclease domain.

bium melilotiRmInt1, which uses a mechanism associated with
DNAreplicationtoprimereversetranscription(Mart ´ınez-Abarca
et al.2004;G a r c´ıa-Rodr´ıguez et al.2019).
The mobility of group II introns requires RNA splicing via
two transesterification reactions, the first of which starts with
a nucleophilic attack of 2
′-OH on a bulged adenosine in DVI,
with the second reaction resulting in the generation of an
excised intron lariat and exon ligation (Fig.3A). The IEP facil-
itates this stage, by acting as a maturase, with the RT and X

domains functioning together to bind the intron RNA specifi-
cally, thereby promoting the formation of a stable ribonucleo-
protein (RNP) complex (Belfort and Lambowitz2019). This active
ribozyme can migrate to new DNA targets in the host genome
by a process involving a target-primed reverse transcription
(TPRT) mechanism, in which the RT domain synthesizes the
intron cDNA of the reverse-spliced intron RNA in one strand
of a double-stranded-DNA target site (Lambowitz and Zimmerly
2011). Intron mobility can occur via retrotransposition, wherein
the intron is introduced into ectopic sites, but the principal
mobility pathway of group II introns is retrohoming, in which
the intron is inserted into a target region of the host genome
(Belfort and Lambowitz2019).
Despite detailed characterization of the mobility path-
ways of group II introns, the ecological implications of these
retroelements in host cells are poorly understood, with only
a few studies published to date. Group II introns, which are
considered to be selfish elements, tend to localize at higher
densities on plasmids than on chromosomes and frequently
hideinotherMGEs,suchasothergroupIIintrons,abroadrange
of transposases and some phage-related proteins, disrupting
these elements and their functions (Waldernet al.2020). In one
study, following the acquisition of the RmInt1 group II intron by
conjugative transfer, the colonization of homing sites, typically
insertion sequences (IS Rm2011-2 and close homologs), was
found to occur at high frequency via the preferred retrohoming
pathway, with sites located on the template for lagging-strand
synthesis invaded first, followed by those on the leading strand
template (Nisa-Mart´ınez et al. 2007). The splicing of RmInt1
naturally inserted into an IS interrupting a transposase gene is
almost completely abolished, but this intron retains its invasion
capacity, suggesting that group II introns may, to some extent,
control the spread of other MGEs (Chill´on, Mart´ınez-Abarca and
Toro 2011). These findings suggest that group II introns may
have an evolutionary role in circumventing splicing, preventing
the mobility of harmful elements in the bacterial cell and
forming a particular defense system.
Consistentwiththishypothesis,anothergroupIIintroninte-
grated into a relaxase gene on a conjugative plasmid has been
shown to inhibit host gene expression and to restrain the natu-
rally cohabiting mobile element, preventing its conjugative hor-
izontal transfer by decreasing the levels of spliced mRNA (Qu
et al.2018). This process seems to function as a defensive bar-
rier, limiting the spread of other mobile elements acting as gen-
eral inhibitors of gene expression. However, the relaxase stim-
ulates intron dispersal by nicking the conjugative plasmid and

Figure 2. RT domestication from an ancestral retroelement. The scheme depicts a hypothetical scenario of the domestication of the different RT lineages from an
autonomous mobile retroelement, probably an ancestral group II intron. The RNA domains (I–VI) as well as the exon regions (E1 and E2) and the differentdomains of
the intron encoded protein (RT: Reverse Transcriptase; X: Maturase; D: DNA-binding and En: Endonuclease) are indicated. At some point, the intron RNA component
was lost, and the remaining RTs coevolved with their genomic context, resulting in the recruitment of RTs to various specialized systems. The G2L RTs may represent
an intermediate state between a mobile group II intron and a domestication of these RTs leading to nascent functional associations. Here, an example of a putative
association between G2L-RTs and a multicomponent system comprised by the queousine biosynthesis pathway QueA, QueC, QueE (queuosine biosynthesispathway)
and FGE-s (FGE sulfatase), YaaA (DNA-binding protein) and Gly (Glycosyltransferase) proteins is shown. The RTs associated with CRISPR-Cas systemspresent different
stages of association: first a group II intron was inserted into the genomic context of acas1 gene. Following a loss of mobility, the remaining RT coevolved with
cas1, resulting in a functional association. Subsequently, RT and Cas1 were fused and, later, a Cas6 domain was acquired independently. Alternatively, the RT and
AEP primase domain (PrimS) may have fused to form a particular group of RT-CRISPR systems. DGR RTs have evolved to hypermutate the variable region (VR) of
several target genes with a specific fold domain and through a mutagenic reverse transcription of a target region (TR). DGRs are typically assisted by various ancillary
proteins including Avd (Accessory variability determinant), HRDC (Helicase and RNaseD C-terminal domain), MSL (MutS-like) and CH1 (Conserver Hypothetical Gene
1). In the case of retrons, RTs have become associated with small ncRNAs and an effector module, some of them forming tripartite toxin/antitoxin systems with
antiviral properties. The wide variety of effectors suggests that the retron unit is highly modular and, in some cases, the RT and other domains have fused (TOPRIM:

RTs are fused to unknown domains, except for AbiA, in which the RT is fused to a HEPN domain. Most RTs from the UG lineage remain uncharacterized, but some
have been shown to confer resistance to phages and are now known as defense-associated RTs (DRTs). DRTs may consist of the RT itself, but the RT is also often fused
to a nitrilase domain or associated with other RT proteins. The arrows denote events that have been inferred during the domestication of the differentRT lineages.

Figure 3.Role of RTs in prokaryotic immunity. (A), Group II intron life cycle. The RNA domains (I–VI) as well as the exon regions (E1 and E2) and the RT and homing
nuclease domains of intron encoded protein are indicated. Intron splicing steps form a lariat RNA which constitute a complex with the IEP. As soon as thet a r g e t
DNA is found, intron reverse splices into the target DNA, frequently a mobile genetic element, abolishing its mobility via a process termed retrohoming. (B), Retrons
are tripartite modular systems, some of which have been shown to act as toxin/antitoxin systems. The retron unit is comprised by a non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
and the RT gene. The RT produces an msDNA at high copy number using the ncRNA as template. This msDNA remaining bound to the RT, forming the antitoxin
unit. The effector module, formed by one or more genes with different enzymatic functions, constituting the toxin effector, is inhibited by direct contact with the
antitoxin. By an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, when a phage infects the cell, triggers the msDNA processing/degradation, allowing the toxin to cause cell
death, to protect cell population. (C), Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) introduce random mutations into the template repeat (TR), in a reaction known as
mutagenic reverse transcription, which is performed by the RT with the help of an ancillary protein (typically Avd: Accessory variability determinant). The mutated
cDNA is then integrated into the variable region (VR) of a target gene (TG), generating considerable sequence variability. The TG generally encodes aprotein displaying
protein–protein interactions or with surface activities enabling the host cell to adapt to different conditions, such as host–phage interactions.(D), RTs associated with
RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas systems (type III and VI) form an integrase complex together with Cas1 and Cas2, facilitating the acquisition of RNA molecules, which are
integrated into the CRISPR array as a new spacer. (E), RTs involved in abortive infection (Abi) systems are part of AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2, but their mechanisms of action
remain unknown. In AbiA, the RT is fused to a HEPN domain and is thought to degrade host or phage RNA to confer resistance. In AbiK, a random-sequence DNA

the chromosome (Novikovaet al.2014). Thus, the relaxase facil-
itates plasmid dispersal and retrotransposition events, whereas
the group II intron regulates relaxase expression, maintaining a
balance that may be positive for the host.
Contrasting with this inhibitory function, one recent study
showed that group II introns could increase genetic diver-
sity by creating chimeric relaxase variants through the shuf-
fling of coding sequences in RNA and DNA, thereby showing
that these retroelements can be beneficial to the conjugative
elements that harbor them and to their bacterial host (LaRoche-
Johnston, Bosan and Cousineau2020). Moreover, the existence
of host factors acting as global regulators of intron mobility has
been demonstrated. Some of these factors, such as RNAse E, act
as depressors, whereas others, such as the alarmones ppGpp
and cAMP, act as stimulators, demonstrating the role of nutri-
tionalstressintheactivationoftheseretroelements(Coros etal.

group II introns may act by preventing the damage caused by

other MGEs activated by stress conditions. Although these find-
ings support that group II introns occasionally facilitate host
adaptation, they are also in agreement with the reported self-
ish behavior of these retroelements that allows them to spread
and survive within their bacterial host.
Retrons
In 1984, an unusual single-stranded DNA, known as multicopy
single-stranded DNA (msDNA) was found to accumulate to high
levelsinthebacterium Myxococcusxanthus (Yeeetal. 1984).Itwas
subsequently shown that msDNA was produced by an RT using
at w o - r e g i o n(msr and msd) non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as a tem-
plate, forming a unit called retron (Inouyeet al.1989; Lampson
etal. 1989; LimandMaas 1989).Thiswas thefirstdemonstration
of RT activity in prokaryotic organisms (Inouye2017). Retrons
havebeenstudiedindetailbiochemically(Lampson,Inouyeand
Inouye 2005), but their biological role has remained unknown
more than 30 years after their discovery (Simon, Ellington and
Finkelstein 2019). However, several independent studies have
shed light on the function of retrons, proposing that they act
as a novel prokaryotic defense system against phages (Gaoet al.
2020; Millmanet al.2020). Interestingly, these studies show that
themsDNAmoleculeiscrucialfortheantiviralactivityofretron
systems(Gao etal. 2020;Millman etal. 2020;Bobonis etal. 2020a).
DuringmsDNAsynthesis,theRTproteinisboundtothetran-
scribed ncRNA just downstream from themsd region, where it
initiates a reverse transcription reaction using a 2
′-OH group
present in a conserved branching G residue in themsr region as
a primer. The resulting msDNA remains covalently attached to
themsrRNAasasinglebranchedmoleculethrougha2 ′-5′ phos-
phodiester bond (Shimamoto, Inouye and Inouye1995). Despite
the considerable divergence ofmsr/msd sequences in the small
numberofexperimentallyvalidatedretrons,allthesesequences
have a number of structural properties in common, including
complementary 5
′ and 3′ ends of the ncRNA, facilitating for-
mation of the secondary structure of the RNA. Themsr region
presents a variable number of short stem-loops and the msd
region folds into a single hairpin with a long stem, all of these
features being indispensable for msDNA production (Lampson,
Inouye and Inouye2005; Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019).
The recent expansion of the range and diversity of known
retrons based on genome survey analyses has made it possible
to increase the number of putative retrons from tens to thou-
sands, with most of these elements containing in RT motif 7
the characteristic ‘VTG’ signature (Toroet al. 2019a). About a
third of annotated retrons were thought to encode an ancillary
gene (Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019), but a computer
pipeline for the systematic prediction of genes specifically asso-
ciatedwithretronshasshownthatapproximately75%ofretrons
include an additional component, as an independent gene or a
RT-fused domain (Mestreet al.2020); retrons should, therefore,
beconsideredtripartitesystems(Fig. 2).Interestingly,thisreport
showed that the use of covariance models and consensus RNA
structure detection makes it possible to identify putative retron
ncRNA consensus structures, even in groups with no experi-
mentally validated representatives. A comparison of the phylo-
geniesofthethreeretroncomponentsindicatesthatretronsare
not only highly modular, with the same type of RT associated
with different domains and vice versa, but that they have also
co-evolved, suggesting that they may act as a functional unit.
Moreover, based on the high diversity of putative enzymatic
activities encoded by the genes or associated domains, retrons
have been classified into 13 types and 25 subtypes, revealing
a tremendous diversity of possible mechanisms and biological
functions not only related to defense (Mestreet al.2020).
Interest in prokaryotic defense mechanisms against phages
has led to several strategies for searching for novel immu-
nity systems. The most successful has involved searching for
clusters of antiviral system genes in defense islands (Doron
et al.2018). This approach has led to some retron types being
identified as abundant in these islands, and two independent
reports (Gao et al. 2020; Millman et al. 2020) have recently
shown that some retron systems confer resistance to a wide
range of phages. In addition, mutations of the three com-
ponents of the system have been shown to abolish immu-
nity, indicating that all three are required for correct activity.
The isolation of phages able to overcome the resistance con-
ferred by Retron-Eco6 (Ec48), a type IV retron system accord-
ing to the recent classification (Mestreet al. 2020), led to the
detection of genetic mutations inactivating a phage RecBCD
inhibitor. This suggests that Retron-Eco6 acts as a RecBCD
guardian, sensing the presence of phage-encoded RecBCD
inhibitors and somehow activating the associated protein, in
this case, a two-transmembrane domain protein, resulting in
cell death (Millman et al. 2020). However, Retron-Eco8, a type
I-B2 retron system (Mestre et al. 2020), has been shown to
act independently of RecBCD (Millman et al. 2020), highlight-
ing the diverse possible modes of action underlying the antivi-
ral activity of retrons, potentially due to highly diverse enzyme
activities.
In parallel, Retron-Sen2 (St85), a type I-B1 retron system
(Mestre et al. 2020), has been shown to act as a novel type
of tripartite toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, in which the RT and
msDNAformtheantitoxindirectlyblockingthetoxinunitcalled
RcaT. This protein has been predicted to present a N-terminal
nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase-like (NDT) domain and a C-
terminal DNA binding domain (Mestreet al.2020). Furthermore,
the toxicity of RcaT increases in cold temperatures or anaero-
bic conditions (Elfenbein et al. 2015; Bobonis et al. 2020a)a n d
its binding to the RT protein does not interfere with its tox-
icity (Bobonis et al. 2020a). However, the presence of the RT-
msDNA complex binding the effector protein determines anti-
toxin specificity (Fig.3B). Phage-origin triggers and prophages-
encoded blockers of this novel TA system have also been identi-
fied,suggestinganextensivearms-racebetweenretronsystems
and phages (Bobonisetal. 2020b). Some of the triggers identified
(Dam and RecE) have been shown to directly interact with the
RT-msDNA complex, methylating, cleaving and/or binding the
msDNA component and, therefore, triggering the activation of
the toxin. Moreover, Dam and RecE have anti-restriction proper-
ties and could lead to Abi mediated by RcaT through the inac-
tivation of RT-msDNA antitoxins, suggesting crosstalk between
the innate/adaptive immunity systems and this tripartite TA
system. One of the identified blockers is RacC, a small protein
encoded by Rac-prophage which acts directly against the toxin
activity,raisingthepossibilityoftheexistenceofphage-encoded
anti-retron systems.
Despite the great progress in our understanding of retrons
based on these recent discoveries, many biological questions
remain unanswered, concerning the ways in which different
types ofretronsystems sensephages, howtheantitoxinisinac-
tivated, or the role of the toxin in the final step in this form
of immunity. Moreover, new types of retrons with new ncRNA
structures have recently been identified but have not yet been
experimentallycharacterized(Mestre etal. 2020).Furtherstudies
are therefore required to improve our understanding of the bio-
logical role of retrons as an anti-phage system and of the other

tial for sensing other cell signals.
Diversity-generating retroelements
DGRs are a unique type of domesticated RT-containing system
that have evolved to provide benefits to the host through a
reverse transcription reaction generating broad sequence vari-
ability in a specific target gene (Zimmerly and Wu2015). It has
been suggested that they originated from a loss of movement
capacity in another type of retroelement followed by diversifi-
cation, and they are widespread in phages, plasmids, bacterial
and archaeal genomes (Paul et al. 2017;Y a net al. 2019; Roux
et al. 2020). The functional unit of DGRs is highly diverse and
formed by a variable gene cassette, but all DGRs have at least
three essential components: a reverse transcriptase (RT), a tem-
plate repeat (TR) and a target gene (TG) with a variable region
(VR) displaying≈90% sequence identity to the TR (Fig.3C). DGRs
increasetheabilityofthehosttoadapttochangingenvironmen-
talconditionsthroughareactioncalledmutagenicretrohoming,
during which the TR RNA is randomly modified by a mutagenic
reverse transcription process, and the resulting cDNA, typically
with random A-to-N mutations, is inserted into the VR region,
replacing the native sequence and creating multiple novel ver-

Several DGRs have been characterized in bacterial genomes
(Le Coq and Ghosh 2011; Arambula et al. 2013), but the best-
known and understood example of mutagenic retrohoming is
that of the DGR of theBordetella phage BPP-1 (Liu et al. 2002).
DGR activity controls phage tropism switching, by generating
new variants of the major tropism determinant (Mtd) protein of
the tail. This protein is responsible for binding to pertactin, an
adhesinonthecellsurfaceof Bordetellaspeciesthatisexpressed
only during the virulent Bvg
+ phase. DGR hypermutation in Mtd
therefore facilitates the adaptation of phage tropism to surface
modifications in the host bacterium (Liuet al. 2002; Doulatov
et al.2004). The VR is found at the 3′ end of themtd gene, cor-
responding to a CLec (C-type lectin) fold consisting of a struc-
turalscaffoldandafinalregioninwhichmassivemutationscan
occur, resulting in functional protein variants (McMahonet al.
2005). Furthermore, the mutagenic retrohoming performed by
theBPP-1phageDGRrequiresseveralancillaryelementsforeffi-
cacy.Anaccessoryvariabilitydeterminant( avd)geneisinvolved
in the mutagenic reverse transcription reaction, binding both
the RT protein and the RNA of the TR (Alayyoubiet al.2013). Fol-
lowingcDNAsynthesis,recognitionbetweenTRandVRrequires
a GC-rich sequence called the initiation of mutagenic homing
(IMH) sequence at the 3
′ end of the VR, together with a slightly
different IMH sequence (IMH∗) in TR. A DNA stem-loop struc-
ture just downstream from the IMH sequence facilitates IMH-
IMH∗ recognition, ensuring directional retrohoming and, there-
fore, resulting in the correct insertion of a novel VR in the target
gene (Guoet al.2011; Naoremet al.2017).
Over the years, research has greatly expanded the num-
ber of putative DGRs identified, with the prediction of these
retroelements in genomic (Parket al.2012; Schillinger and Zin-
gler 2012; Nimkulrat et al. 2016;W u et al. 2018) and metage-
nomicdata(Yan etal. 2019; Rouxetal. 2020).Furthermore, bioin-
formatics tools have been developed to identify and character-
ize DGRs. These tools include DiGReF (Schillingeret al. 2012),
DGRscan (Ye2014) and MyDGR (Sharifi and Ye2019). All these
reports have progressively revealed the widespread presence of
DGRs in prokaryotes and phages and have demonstrated the
great variability of their genetic components and their func-
tional diversity. Indeed, many bacterial DGRs have been shown
to be encoded by temperate phages inserted into bacterial
chromosomes as prophages (Benler et al. 2018). Based on RT
sequences, the largest DGR dataset available compiles 32 321
sequences,groupedinto1318clusters( ≥50%identity),including
DGRs from phages and prokaryotic organisms, in both genomes
and metagenomes (Rouxet al.2020). This survey revealed that
DGRs predominate in continually changing environments, in
which hypermutation is highly beneficial to the host. In these
ecological conditions,continual attempts at thehorizontal gene
transfer of DGR cassettes are made between phylogenetically
distantorganisms,enhancingtheadaptationofabroadrangeof
biological entities. Furthermore, using non-synonymous single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) has been shown that most DGRs (50-
75%)analyzedpresentsignsofrecentactivity,withhigheractiv-
ity levels in phage-associated than in cellular DGRs, in which
hypermutation may be induced under stress conditions (Roux
et al.2020).
DGRs present a broad range of cassette architectures, based
on the order, number and orientation of their components
(Fig. 2). For example, there are four classes of accessory genes,
with avd the most common (over 70%), but some DGR loci lack
this ancillary ORF. Furthermore, DGRs can present multiple tar-
get genes (from 2 to 8) and can act intrans (Wu et al. 2018).
Despite this modular organization, the target genes typically
encode multidomain proteins with the VR located at the C-
terminus. These regions are associated only with the C-type
lectin fold and with an uncharacterized domain next to Ig-like
foldproteinsequences(Roux etal. 2020).Inaddition,VRssharea
highly conserved sequence on either side of the fold sequence,
whereas the internal sequence is subject to mutagenesis (Wu
et al. 2018). The crystal structure of the C-type lectin fold has
revealed an unusually large capacity to accommodate massive
sequence variation (Handaet al.2016). This and the conserved
bias towards adenine mutation indicate that DGRs are mecha-
nistically limited in terms of how and where they can produce
diversity (Wuet al.2018; Roux et al.2020
). However, the target
proteins have also been shown to be highly modular, suggesting
that genetic recombination occurs between independent fold-
ing domains and a C-terminal C-type lectin fold to generate
chimeric targets (Rouxet al.2020). This process may be the evo-
lutionary source of the involvement of DGRs in various func-
tions beneficial for the host. Target genes are currently classi-
fied on the basis of the putative functions of the domains out-
side the VR sequence, mostly involved in protein–protein bind-
ing, ligand binding or surface displays activities, suggesting a
broad range of potential biological functions, including viru-
lence, virus-host or cell-cell interactions (Fig.3C). Most phage
target genes encode structural proteins, the variability of which
enables phages to overcome bacterial defenses based on cell
wall modifications, whereas cellular target genes encode pro-
teins involved in binding extracellular substrates (Rouxet al.
2020). A new target function has recently been described, with
a group of specific cyanobacterial DGRs able to hypermutate
a small pocket in binding domains of multidomain proteins
broadly involved in regulatory pathways (Vallota-Eastmanet al.
2020). Given the broad array of possible scenarios, further char-
acterization of novel types of DGRs is required to develop a full
understanding of the role of these elements in their biological
niches.
RTs associated with CRISPR–Cas systems
CRISPR–Cas (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) systems are an adap-
tive immune system harbored by archaea and bacteria for
8 FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 2021, Vol. 45, No. 6
defense against foreign nucleic acids, mostly MGEs, such as
phages, transposons and plasmids (Barrangou et al. 2007).
CRISPR-mediated immunity occurs in three stages: adaptation,
expression and interference (Van der Oost et al. 2014). How-
ever, the mechanism of the immune response is highly variable,
thanks to the considerable diversity of CRISPRs, comprising two
classes, six types and 33 subtypes (Makarovaet al. 2020). The
relationship between RTs and these very diverse defense sys-
tems was described for the first time in 2008 (Kojima and Kane-
hisa 2008; Simon and Zimmerly2008).
Both these studies showed that the reverse transcriptase-
coding region was adjacent or fused to thecas1 gene, which
is present in most CRISPR–Cas systems. This observation was
endorsedbybroaderstudiesofRTslinkedtothesesystems(Toro
and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014; Toro, Mart´ınez-Abarca and Gonz´alez-
Delgado2017).Simultaneously,itwasshownthatCas1andCas2
formanintegrasecomplexresponsibleforperformingtheadap-
tive step of CRISPR-Cas immunity, which involves the insertion
of a genetic fragment of the invading agent, known as the pro-
tospacer, into the CRISPR array as a new spacer between two
repeatsequences,thedirectrepeats(DRs;Yosef,GorenandQim-
ron 2012;N u˜nez et al. 2014;J a c k s o net al. 2017). This particular
group of RTs may, therefore, be involved in acquiring new spac-
ers from RNA sources.
Thishypothesiswasrecentlyvalidatedbythreeindependent
studies in different systems: the Cas6RTCas1 adaptive operon
fromMarinomasmediterranea MMB-1(Silas etal. 2016),theRTCas1
system fromFusicanibacter saccharivorans(Schmidt, Cherepkova
and Platt 2018) and the RTCas1 system from Vibrio vulnificus
YJ016 (Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019). All three studies showed
that RT-CRISPR systems can acquire new spacers directly from
RNA in vivo,in an RT-dependent manner, via a mechanism with
features common to group II intron retrohoming (Fig.3D). It has
also been demonstrated that the additional Cas6 domain in the
M. mediterraneasystem participates in CRISPR–RNA (crRNA) bio-
genesis and is required for RT activity and its regulation (Mohr
et al.2018). This crosstalk between the different components of
RT–CRISPR systems has been validated by the cryo-EM structure
of a Cas6RTCas1–Cas2 complex fromThiomicrospira(Wanget al.
2021), in which the linking RT helix regulates both RT and Cas1
activities.
In the conditions analyzed, the spacers acquired by the RT-
containing adaptive operon in these systems were found to
be biased towards highly transcribed regions (Silaset al.2016;
Schmidt, Cherepkova and Platt2018) or highly abundant rRNAs
(Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019), reflecting a correlation between
spacer acquisition events and RNA abundance. The systems
studied displayed a bias towards the antisense strand of coding
sequences in the newly acquired spacers of the CRISPR Array
when the adaptive unit was present alone. Most RTs are asso-
ciated with type III CRISPR-Cas systems (Silaset al.2017;T o r o ,
Mart´ınez-Abarca and Gonz´alez-Delgado 2017; Toroet al.2019a),
which recognize both DNA and RNA targets for target degra-
dation. This slight preference for the antisense strand during
acquisition therefore improves the performance of the interfer-
ence step of type III systems, thanks to the complementarity
between the crRNA and the target transcript (Pyenson and Mar-
raffini 2017). However, the natural sources of the spacers found
in CRISPR Arrays associated with RT-containing CRISPR–Cas loci
remaintobedetermined.Duetothelimitedabundanceanddis-
tribution of RNA phages, only one natural example of CRISPR
immunity to an RNA phage has been described (Wolfetal. 2020),
andonlyafewmatchestoDNAphage-likesequenceshavebeen
found (Silaset al.2017). Different approaches, such as exploring
the larger number of metagenomes available from databases, as
well and the recent expansion of known ssRNA phage genomes
from tens to 15 611 near-complete genomes (Callanan et al.
2020), might help to shed light on this topic and improve our
understanding of the biological role of RT–CRISPR–Cas systems
in their environmental niche.
The origin and evolutionary relationships of RTs function-
ally associated with CRISPR-Cas systems have been a matter
of debate since the proposal of two models, one suggesting
a ‘single-point origin’, in which RTs are domesticated by the
CRISPR–Cas locus via the retrotransposition of a group II intron
(Silas et al. 2017), and the other postulating ‘multiple origins’,
in which RTs related to group II introns have been recruited
by CRISPR–Cas adaptation modules several times during evo-
lution (Toro et al. 2018). However, new insight into the ‘mul-
tiple origins’ model was provided by a recent analysis of the
putative RT sequences in bacterial genomes (Toroet al.2019a).
This study identified a total of 15 clades of CRISPR-RTs: 13
clades closely related to group II introns already reported in
the previous analysis (Toro et al. 2018), and two new clades,
one evolved from retron/retron-like sequences (clade 14) and
the other from RTs related to the RT domain present in Abi-P2
systems (clade 15). Furthermore, novel RT sequences adjacent
or fused to an Archaeo-eukaryotic primase (AEP) domain and
belongingtoclade12havebeendescribed(Fig. 2),suggestingthe
possibility of cDNA production without the use of a primer to
facilitate the acquisition of spacers in these particular systems.
AlltheRTsdescribedinthesestudieswerefoundtobefunction-
ally linked to type III CRISPR–Cas systems, with the exception
of those AbiP2-like RTs linked to a type I-C system, but a recent
studyreportedtherecruitmentofRTCas1fusionproteinsbytype

The presence of novel RTs in some type III and VI CRISPR–Cas
systemssuggestsanadaptiveadvantageofthesesystemsinthe
RNA world that it would be worth characterizing further in the
searchforunusualmechanismsofspaceracquisitionthatwould
help us to understand CRISPR biology.
RTs involved in Abortive bacteriophage infection (Abi) systems
Abi systems are a prokaryotic defense mechanism against bac-
teriophages in which the infection cycle of the virus is blocked,
by halting host metabolism or driving the cell to its death. In
thisway,Abisystemspreventphagemultiplication,therebypro-
tecting the rest of the population (Bernheim and Sorek2020).
A tremendous variety of Abi genes has been described, with
about 20 different Abi systems present inLactococcus spp. alone.
Another indicator of the heterogeneity of Abi systems is that
three such systems contain an RT domain: AbiA, AbiK and
Abi-P2 (Fortier, Bouchard and Moineau2005; Odegrip, Nilsson
andHagg ˚ard-Ljungquist2006;DurmazandKlaenhammer 2007).
However, the role of the putative reverse transcriptase activity
in these systems remains unclear. Only in the case of AbiK has
been shown that the RT domainper se is sufficient to confer
phageresistance(Fortier,BouchardandMoineau 2005).ForAbiA
and Abi-P2, it remains unclear whether other genetic elements
present at the same locus are required for defense activity.
Each of these systems has a different mode of operation, but
the N-terminal RT domains of Abi proteins have several fea-
tures in common, including the conservation of a potentially
active site with a Y(R/V)DD sequence and the absence of the
RT motif 7 (Simon and Zimmerly2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez
Gonz´alez-Delgado et al. 9
2014). A C-terminal domain of variable length and uncharacter-
ized function fused to this domain is also present in all types
of RT-based Abi systems (Fig. 2). It has been suggested that
the AbiA C-terminal domain is a novel version of the higher
eukaryote and prokaryote nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain
(Anantharaman et al.2013). In many defense systems, includ-
ing restriction-modification (R-M), toxin-antitoxin (TA), CRISPR–
Cas and other Abi systems, HEPN domains play a key role due
their RNAse activity, which may directly attack viral RNAs or
induce host suicide or dormancy by attacking self-RNAs. The
presence of RT and HEPN domains in AbiA suggests that phage
multiplication may be inhibited through interaction between
phage-encoded proteins and a DNA molecule covalently linked
to the RT, with the HEPN domain degrading host RNA, driving
the cell to suicide and protecting the surrounding community
(Fig. 3E). Indeed, the best-characterized AbiA protein, which is
found in a lactococcal plasmid (Hill, Pierce and Klaenhammer
1989), is able to stop phage replication. Furthermore, a mutant
in a phage recombinase have been shown to be insensitive to
AbiA-mediated immunity (Dinsmore and Klaenhammer1997),
suggesting that this recombinase could trigger AbiA. Loci con-
tainingAbiAsequenceshavebeenshowntoconferimmunityto
a wide set of lactococcal phages (Hill, Miller and Klaenhammer
1990; Tangney and Fitzgerald2002a). The lactococcal AbiA also
displays versatile heterologous activity, conferring resistance to
severalphagesina Streptococcusthermophilus strain(Tangneyand
Fitzgerald 2002b).
Thebest-knownRT-basedAbisystemisAbiK,whichhasalso
been found in a plasmid native to a lactococcal strain (Emond
et al.1997). In addition to AbiA, this system provides resistance
to a broad range of lactococcal phages (936, c2 and P335), reduc-
ing infectivity by six orders of magnitude (Fortier, Bouchard and
Moineau 2005). The AbiK protein has a DNA polymerase activ-
ity divergent from that of canonical RTs and acts like a termi-
nal transferase, polymerizing DNAs of random sequence (Wang
et al. 2011). Moreover, the synthesized product remains cova-
lently attached to the enzyme, possibly via a hydroxide group
on a tyrosine located in the C-terminal domain, which could
act as the primer for a reaction that would be similar to that
observed in hepadnavirus self-priming (Wang and Seeger1992).
Conversely, studies of phage mutants able to escape AbiK have
identified different viral proteins sensitive to AbiK-mediated
immunity. All these proteins, denoted Sak (sensitivity to AbiK),
participate in the phage replication process (Ploquinet al.2008;
Lopes et al.2010;S c a l t r i t iet al.2010;S c a l t r i t iet al.2011). In this
way,theAbiKsystemworkslikeAbiA,preventingphagematura-
tionbyafunctional interactionwithSakproteinsandprovoking
cell death by an unknown mechanism (Fig.3E).
Unlike the previously described systems, Abi-P2 is encoded
in a highly variable region of several P2 prophages present in
different E. colistrains, with a higher AT content than the host
genome, suggesting that this region may have been acquired by
HGT (Odegrip, Nilsson and Hagg˚ard-Ljungquist 2006). Further-
more, Abi-P2 displays reverse transcriptase activity and confers
resistance to the T5 phage by decreasing the plating efficiency
of this phage by more than seven orders of magnitude (Fig.3E).
Moreover, deletion of the region of the gene containing the
sequence encoding the putative active site of Abi-P2 (YRDD)
abolishes resistance to the phage. A recent genome survey
analysis enlarged the number of known RT-based Abi systems
by an order of magnitude, with Abi-P2 accounting for 75% of
these systems (Toro et al. 2019a). Non-redundant homologs
of AbiA, AbiK and Abi-P2 have been found in many bacterial
phyla and are particularly diverse in the phylum Firmicutes. By
contrast, no RT-containing Abi systems has ever been found in
Archaea. With the increasing number of examples identified,
research in this field merits a new impetus, to shed light on the
role of these Abi-like RTs in phage resistance.
RTs from unknown groups (UG)
Overtheyears,noveluncharacterizedRTsmoredistantlyrelated
to group II intron RTs and clustering in the so-called ‘unknown
groups’ have emerged in analyses of increasing numbers of RT
sequences (Kojima and Kanehisa 2008; Simon and Zimmerly
2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014). There are now 28 differ-
ent UGs covering 10% of prokaryotic RT diversity (Toroet al.
2019a) showing considerable sequence diversity. For example,
UG1 and UG5 RTs have a C-terminal nitrilase domain (Simon
andZimmerly 2008),whereas,inUG6,thisdomainislocatedfur-
ther downstream in an adjacent ORF (Gaoet al.2020). UG3 and
UG8 represent a unique case in which RT sequences are always
located next to each other, suggesting that they act as a func-
tional unit (Fig.2; Kojima and Kanehisa2008).
RTs from UG groups have recently been found in defense
islands and have been experimentally validated as new anti-
phage systems known as Defense-associated RTs (DRTs), in
whichimmunityisdependentontheRTdomain(Gao etal. 2020).
In DRT type 1 (UG1) both the C-terminal nitrilase domain and
a small membrane protein are required for defense (Fig.3F). In
DRT type 3, corresponding to UG3 and UG8, a structured ncRNA
downstream from the UG8 gene is required for immunity. By
contrast, in DRT type 2 (UG2), type 4 (UG15) and type 5 (UG16),
the RT alone is sufficient for resistance against phages. How-
ever, the mechanism of action of these novel systems remains
undeciphered, and additional experimental data are required
to determine how UG-RTs provide protection against different
types of phages. Moreover, not all UG groups have been tested,
and only some of those investigated display antiviral properties
(Gao et al.2020). The characterization of additional types of UG-
RTs is therefore required, for the discovery of new DRT systems.
Group II-like (G2L) uncharacterized RTs
In addition to the RT lineages described above, novel phyloge-
netic groups may arise through different types of domestica-
tion of ancient retroelements, the function of which remains to
be elucidated. The RTs of one of these groups are most closely
related phylogenetically to group II introns and were therefore
named ‘group II-like’ or ‘G2L’ RTs. The main difference between
the RTs of this group and those classified as group II introns
is the absence of the characteristic intronic RNA structure in
the G2L group (Simon and Zimmerly2008). A previous analy-
sis of the prokaryotic reverse transcriptase landscape (Toroetal.
2019a) led to an increase in the number of identified G2L-type
sequences,withthesesequencesbeingfoundtobranchofffrom
a node common to CRISPR-associated RTs. There is a close rela-
tionship between G2L and CRISPR-RTs, and it should be pointed
out that two groups previously classified as G2L (G2L1 and G2L2)
have since been reclassified as new clades of RT-CRISPR sys-
tems (clade4/6 and clade 9), suggesting that both RT lineages
may have evolved from a common ancestral group II intron
RT. Moreover, the previously named G2L3 (Simon and Zimmerly
2008)wasnoticedtobephylogeneticallyseparatedfromtheG2L
lineage (Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014) and more recently, this
monophyletic group has been reclassified as a novel UG group
named as UG17 (Toroet al. 2019a). The G2L lineage has been
greatly expanded and comprises RT sequences clustered within
the G2L4 and G2L5 groups (Simon and Zimmerly2008) and four
additional clades (Toroet al.2019a).

In this way, G2L may constitute an evolutionary record of
an intermediate state between the autonomous mobilization
of group II intron RTs and the domestication of these RTs for
the performance of useful cellular functions. This hypothesis
wastestedbyanalyzingthegenomicneighborhood(Mestre etal.
2020)ofG2Lsequences,tosearchforpossibleevidenceofemerg-
ingfunctionalassociations(seeSupplementaryMethods).Inter-
estingly, a particular subgroup of G2L RTs (cluster 4; Toroet al.
2019a) appears to be embedded in a multicomponent system
composed of the products of thequeACDEgenes involved in the
queuosine biosynthesis pathway (Thiavilleet al.2016), two dif-
ferent glycosyltransferases, the 5
′-3′ exonuclease domain of a
family A DNA polymerase, a GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase (LmbE),
a phosphoribosyltransferase, YaaA (DUF328), which is a DNA-
binding protein with a novel fold (Prahladet al. 2020), and a
FGE sulfatase with a C-lec fold (Fig.4 and Figure S1, Supporting
Information). QueC was recently reported to be a component of
novel defense systems (Gaoet al.2020), which suggest that this
genomic cassette may also be involved in immunity functions.
Moreover, 25% of known G2L-RT sequences were located close
to known defense system sequences (Fig.4). Thus, functional
associations between G2L and neighboring genes could gener-
ate specialized systems with antiviral activities worthy of fur-
ther investigation.
Differential distribution of RTs in bacteria and archaea
ThemostexhaustivephylogeneticanalysisofbacterialRTsused
198 760 predicted RT proteins and addressed the distribution of
RTs,mostlyinbacteria(Toro etal. 2019a).Theclassificationofthe
final dataset of 9141 non-redundant RTs supported the classifi-
cation of most RTs into the three main groups: group-II introns,
the largest group, accounting for 47% of RTs, retron/retron-like
sequences (25%) and DGRs (12%; Fig.5A and B). The remain-
ing 16% of RTs clustered into distinct groups including RTs pre-
viously reported to be linked to CRISPR–Cas systems, group 2-
like (G2L), Abi-like or UG (unknown) groups. These data are con-
sistent with previously reported findings (Kojima and Kanehisa
2008; Simon and Zimmerly2008; Toro and Nisa-Mart´ınez 2014).
Far fewer RT sequences have been identified in archaea
than in bacteria, because of the smaller number of com-
plete genome sequences available in databases (i.e. more than
3 × 10
5 bacterial genome sequences versus just under 5 ×
103 archaeal genome sequences in the PATRIC database; Sup-
plementary Methods). A more detailed analysis of archaeal
RTs revealed that DGRs accounted for the largest proportion
(30% of total archaeal RTs), contrasting with the situation in
bacteria (with only 12%). The opposite pattern was observed
for retrons, which account for only 4% of total archaeal RTs
(Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary File 1). No RTs from the G2L
or Abi-like groups have been found in archaea. The remain-
ing RT groups account for similar proportions of the RTs in
archaea and bacteria, with group II introns the most abun-
dant (52%), which are probably proliferating in archaea even
though they were originally acquired from bacteria (Fig. 5B;
Toro2003).
In bacteria, the Flavobacteria–Chlorobi–Bacteroidetes group
(FCB), candidate phyla radiation (CPR) and Cyanobacteria have
high rates of non-redundant RTs relative to the number of
sequenced genomes for these phyla (Figure S2A, Supporting
Information). Group II introns are, predictably, prevalent in
most bacterial phyla, but retrons predominate in Proteobacte-
ria, whereas DGRs account for about 80% of total RTs in CPR, the
strongest bias towards a specific RT group in bacteria (Fig.5D).

sequences is indicated after the name of each domain/phylum.
Looked at the other way (distribution of bacterial phyla for par-
ticular RT groups), Proteobacteria is the predominant phylum in
most RT lineages, whereas, Firmicutes account for a large pro-
portion of group II introns and Abi-like RTs. Similarly, the CPR
group contains about 40% of all singular DGRs (Figure S2B, Sup-
porting Information). These data support the notion that some
bacterial phyla have recruited specific groups of RTs to improve
theirresponsestotheecologicalconditionsintheirnaturalenvi-
ronments.
As in bacteria, in most phyla and other taxonomic groups
of archaea there is a correlation between the total number
of genomes sequenced and the total number of RTs found in
the group concerned, except for the TACK group (the Thau-
marchaeota, Aigararchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota
phyla), which accounts for 25% of total archaeal genomes but
only7%ofnon-redundantRTsequences(FigureS2C,Supporting
Information). Group II introns predominate in Euryarchaeota,
the TACK group and the Asgard group (55–75% of RTs). How-
ever, a different scenario emerges for the DPANN group (Dia-
pherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota
and Nanohaloarchaeota) and uncultured/unclassified archaea,
in which DGRs account for about 80% of RTs (Fig.5E). Regard-
ing the dominance of phyla for every RT group, it is worth to
highlight that 90% of all DGRs were found in DPANN group and
unclassified archaea (Figure S2D, Supporting Information).
The abundance of DGRs in the DPANN group and in the bac-
terial CPR group has been described (Paulet al.2017; Rouxet al.
2020),butweshowherethatDGRsare,byfar,themostabundant

type of RT in these phylogenetic groups. Curiously, the DPANN
group is the most divergent of all archaeal groups, resembling
the situation of the CPR group in bacteria (Castelleet al.2018).
Indeed, these groups have several characteristics in common
anddifferfromotherprokaryoticorganismsinhavingsmallcell
andgenomesizes,intheirepisymbioticrelationshipswithother
organisms and their limited metabolic capacities. In this con-
text, the high abundance of DGRs in the DPANN and CPR groups
may reflect a role of RTs of this type in the adaptation of these
organisms to their biological niches through changes in mem-
brane proteins facilitating interactions with the host (Castelle
et al.2018).
Biotechnological applications of prokaryotic RTs
RTs, particularly those from eukaryotes and viruses, have
been exploited as biotechnological tools in a wide range
of fields (Mart´ın-Alonso, Frutos-Beltr´an and Men ´endez-Arias
2020). The unique properties of several prokaryotic RTs groups
have enabled their use in a wide variety of genome editing
applications, including gene targeting, high-throughput site-
directed mutagenesis technologies, libraries of highly mutage-
nized genes or with high-throughput transcriptional character-
ization purposes (Table1).
For gene targeting the specific interactions between intron
and exon-binding sites (IBS–EBS) required for group II intron
retromobility was harnessed to target introns to prepro-
grammed positions (Guo et al. 2000; Mohr et al. 2000;K a r b e r g
et al.2001; Enyeartet al.2014). Thus, group II introns have been
exploited as the first RNA-guided gene targeting tools in a wide
variety of bacterial genomes in the so-called targetron knock-
out technology (Table1). With an algorithm designed to iden-
tify optimal matches, targetrons are programmed to insert into
desiredgenesbymodifyingthesequenceelementsintheintron
RNA to base-pair to the IBS in the DNA target site (Zhuanget al.
2009;G a r c´ıa-Rodr´ıguez et al. 2014;G w e eet al. 2019;W e net al.
2020).ThecouplingofthistechniquewithCRISPR-Cas9counter-
selection has recently increased the chances of finding clones
in which the intron is integrated into the target sequence in
a recombination-independent fashion (Vel´azquez, Lorenzo and
Al-Ramahi 2019). Group II introns have also been programmed
to deliverlox sites which are used by Cre recombinase to gener-
ate insertions, inversions, deletions and one-step cut-and-paste
operations (Table1; Enyeartet al.2013). On the other hand, the
ability of retrons to produce msDNA at high copy number has
allowed the use of these elements with gene silencing purposes
(Table1;M a oet al.1995; Simon, Ellington and Finkelstein2019).
This approach is based on the fact that themsd region can be
modified with a random sequence without disturbing the pro-
duction of msDNA. Thus, retrons could be engineered to syn-
thesize specific DNA molecules that works as antisense cDNAs
to knockdown the mRNA levels of a target gene (Maoetal. 1995).
The particularities of retrons have also been used as an
interesting alternative in high-throughput directed mutagene-
sisapplications(Simon,EllingtonandFinkelstein 2019).Thefirst
approach, referred to as Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrat-
ing Biological Events (SCRIBE), was based on engineered vari-
ants of Retron-Eco1 with a modifiedmsdregion (Table1;F a r z a d -
fard and Lu 2014). The production of the modified msDNA,
which is inducible by arbitrary transcriptional signals (light and
chemical inducers), acts as a genomic ‘tape recorder’ of the
presence of these signals at population level. To increase effi-
ciency, the retron unit is co-expressed in combination with the
Beta recombinase of bacteriophageλ, leading to the recombi-
nation of the modified msDNA into a specific DNAlocus in a
magnitude-andduration-dependentwayofthesignals(Farzad-
fard and Lu2014). However, due to the moderate recombination
level (∼10
−4 recombination events per generation) observed in
this system, several works have studied the factors that lim-
its retron recombineering (Simon, Morrow and Ellington2018;
Farzadfard et al. 2020; Schubert et al. 2020). The first improve-
ments in efficiency were carried out by optimizing the promoter
and by knocking out genes that reduces the accumulation of
msDNA, specifically the mismatch repair protein MutS and the
single-stranded exonuclease ExoX (Simon, Morrow and Elling-
ton 2018). This system yields recombination efficiencies 2 order
of magnitude higher and allows continuous evolution of target
loci by expressing the retron unit under the control of an error-
prone RNA polymerase, which generates random mutations in
the msd region that are introduced into the target DNA (Simon,
MorrowandEllington 2018).Furthermore,thedeletionorsilenc-
ing of other host factors, mainly exonucleases such asrecJ and
sbcB(xonA),significantlyincreasedtherecombinationfrequency
achieving>99% editing efficiency (Table1; Farzadfardetal. 2020;
Schubertetal. 2021). Both works circumvent some limitations of
previous genome-editing technologies in bacteria, including the
need to electroporate with mutagenic oligonucleotides or the
requirementsofspecificcis-encodedelements(i.e.PAMmotifin
CRISPR–Cas9counterselection).Thus,Farzadfardandcolleagues
(2020) introduce HiSCRIBE (High-efficency SCRIBE) and demon-
strate their use in recording transient spatial information and
continuous genome evolution. On the other hand, Schubert and
collaborators (2021) create RLR (Retron Recombination Library)
useful to prepare pooled, barcoded mutant libraries for high-
throughput screens of allelic variants and uniquely suit to uti-
lize non-designed sources of variation. Interestingly, a recent
work has also shown that modifications in the ncRNA structure
and in the architecture of the retron operon lead to a more effi-
cient reverse transcription reaction and, thus, in a higher retron
recombineering efficiency in bacteria, yeast and human cells
(L´opez et al. 2021). Moreover, retron recombineering technolo-
gies have also been used in combination with CRISPR–Cas sys-
tems for multiplex gene editing in bacteria (Limet al.2020)a n d
eukaryotes (Sharonet al.2018). This last study uses a chimeric
RNA comprised by a modified retron ncRNA joined to a CRISPR
guide in a technology called Cas9 Retron precISE Parallel Edit-
ing via homologY (CRISPEY) ideal to identify causal variants for
polygenic traits (Table1).
Continuous target evolution could also be performed using
DGRs, thanks to their ability to generate multiple variants of a
protein domain, which can be useful in biotechnological appli-
cations such as in phage therapy. However, only one prelimi-
narystudyhasbeenabletodemonstratetheabilityofthephage
BPP-1 DGR to create variants of tropism proteins likely to bind
the T4 lysozyme (Table1; Yuanet al.2013). The exploration of
novel DGRs with advantageous properties, such as thermosta-
bility (Handa, Shaw and Ghosh 2019), could provide promis-
ing new tools. In addition, characterization of the mutagenic
retrohoming mechanism has revealed that the RT and Avd pro-
teins of the BPP-1 DGR work as a complex and that both are
required for cDNA synthesis from both DGR and non-DGR tem-
plates with an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) primer (Handaet al.

genic retrohoming is the biological process capable of creating
the highest levels of sequence variability, potentially about 10

ble with eukaryotic systems (Wuetal. 2018). These observations
show that DGRs are a powerful potential tool for protein engi-
neering, for which detailed studies are required to determine
their usefulness.
Prokaryotic RTs have also been exploited for different high-
throughput RNA characterization purposes (Mart ´ın-Alonso,
Frutos-Beltr´an and Men´endez-Arias 2020). The features of spe-
cific Group II intron-RTs, such as some thermostable group II
intron RTs (TGIRTs; Mohret al.2013) and other fromEubacterium
rectale (Marathon RT; Zhao and Pyle 2018), which present ultra-
processive and accurate properties, have been used in RNA-
seq and epitranscriptomics technologies. Interestingly, the RT-
containing CRISPR loci have also been used with similar appli-
cations to record transcriptional events (Schmidt, Cherepkova
and Platt 2018), also expanding the CRISPR–Cas toolbox (Jinek
et al.2012; Komor, Badran and Liu2017; Pickar-Oliver and Gers-
bach 2019; Vigouroux and Bikard2020). The adaptive operon of
F. saccharivorans, a complex formed by the RTCas1 fusion pro-
tein and Cas2, has been used to develop Record-seq technology,
which records transcriptional events in a CRISPR array as DNA,
describing specific and complex cellular behaviors and assess-
ing cumulative gene expression (Table1; Schmidt, Cherepkova
and Platt2018; Tannaet al.2020). However, the use of theF. sac-
charivoranssystem as an RNA-recording tool presents the disad-
vantageofapparentskewingtowardsAT-richregionsattheends
of transcripts. It will be important to analyze more CRISPR–Cas
system harboring RTs, such as theV. vulnificusRTCas1–Cas2A–
Cas2Bsystem,whichcanacquirespacersregardlessoftheir‘GC’
content and from any point in the coding sequence (Gonz´alez-
Delgado et al. 2019), to overcome this limitation. Record-Seq-
derived methods could also be used to improve current tech-
nologies for archiving real data for populations of living cells
(Shipmanetal. 2017),thankstotheabilityofsystemsofthistype
to store highly transcribed regions potentially containing the
information of interest. Moreover, these systems could be used
as highly scalable bacterial biosensors to report on gut function
(Tanna, Ramachanderan and Platt2021). In addition, the char-
acterization of singular RTs linked to CRISPR-Cas systems could
provide useful tools, such as groups of RTs fused to a putative
primase (AEP) domain that might not require priming for cDNA
reactions.
On the other hand, the recent finding that some retrons sys-
tems can constitute novel tripartite TA systems (Gaoet al.2020;
Mestre et al. 2020; Millman et al. 2020; Bobonis et al. 2020a, b)
containing an effector associated protein endowed with anti-
phage activity could also lead to new biotechnological applica-
tions. For example, retrons could be engineered for their use in
phage therapy or as riboswitches, applying certain conditions
that trigger the desired response. Thus, the potential of these
elements as biotechnological tools is only just beginning to be
understood. Furthermore, the large RT proteins involved in Abi
systems could also provide novel biotechnological tools, thanks
to the enzymatic diversity provided by the domains fused to the
C-terminus of the RT domain. These natural fusions are worth
characterizing, particularly for AbiA, in which polymerase and
putative RNAse activities are combined in a single protein that
may function differently from the RTs of retroviruses. Similarly,
the properties of other RTs from other groups, such as the UG
andG2Lgroups,someofwhichareinvolvedinantiviraldefenses
(Gao et al.2020), and those found in Archaea could supply novel
functions for use in the existing or new fields. We are currently
witnessing the first uses of prokaryotic RTs in a broad range of
biotechnology applications.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This review describes how prokaryotic organisms have domes-
ticated the different types of RTs to perform defense functions
against phages and other MGEs. The outstanding research per-
formed in the last few years has not only resolved the 30-year-
old enigma of the biological role of retrons (Gaoet al.2020; Mill-
man et al.2020; Bobonis et al.2020a, b), but also revealed why
thepresenceofanRTisadvantageousforsometypesofCRISPR–
Cas systems (Silaset al.2016; Toroet al.2019b), and has shown
that some uncharacterized groups of RTs confer resistance to
a wide range of phages (Gaoet al.2020). However, several key
questions remain unanswered. From an evolutionary point of
view, it would be worthwhile improving our understanding of
how group II introns evolved in their host genome and gave rise
to other types of prokaryotic RTs. Interestingly, defense systems
and MGEs have several characteristics in common, including
being the only two functional categories of genes with a neg-
ative selection coefficient (Iranzoet al.2017), implying that they
canbedeleterioustothehost.Theseparallelevolutionaryhisto-
riescouldprovidethenecessarysubstrateformobilegeneticele-

occasions throughout evolution, as demonstrated for CRISPR–
Cassystems(KooninandMakarova 2019).Itwouldbereasonable
to hypothesize that group II introns may have been the source
ofotherdomesticatedRTsforvariousdefensesystems.Research
on RTs phylogenetically related to group II introns, such as the
G2L lineage, could shed light on this issue.
With our current knowledge of RTs, we are only just begin-
ning to understand the impact of these enzymes in prokary-
otes.ExploringnewgroupsofrecentlyexpandedgroupIIintrons
(Toroet al.2019a) may shed light on how these selfish elements
achieve a balance between their inherent need to spread and
theirabilitytocontrolMGEs,resultinginbenefittothehost.The
recentlydiscoveredanti-phageactivityofretronshasopenedup
a whole new avenue of research, extending from clarification of
the stages of retron-mediated immunity to the way in which
phages overcome this defensive barrier. Given the modularity
and diversity of retron systems (Mestreet al. 2020), a number
of completely different biological mechanisms may be involved.
A parallel track could be followed for UGs, in which computa-
tional analysis may also reveal the existence of more diversity,
potentiallyassociatedwithotherproteinsorncRNAsandconsti-
tutingnovelDRTs.Interestingly,phylogeneticanalysis(Toroand

similarlytoAbi-RTs,leadingthehostcelltocommitsuicide.The
presence of an RT domain provides an adaptive advantage to
RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas systems (types III and VI; Silaset al.
2016; Gonz´alez-Delgado et al.2019), but the origin of the spac-
ers in the CRISPR arrays of systems carrying RTs and the struc-
tural basis of the mechanism of RNA spacer integration into the
array remain a mystery. Further studies are therefore required
to improve our understanding of type III and VI CRISPR biology.
Finally, in addition to their known functions, the other possible
roles of DGRs should be studied, to shed light on the ways in
which mutagenic reverse transcription helps the host to adapt
to changing environmental conditions, particularly for CPR bac-
teria and DPANN archaea, in which DGRs are particularly abun-
dant (Paulet al.2017; Rouxet al.2020).
Gonz´alez-Delgado et al. 15
Therecentlyproposed‘pan-immunesystem’modelsuggests
that, even if a particular strain does not have genes encoding all
types of defense systems, the pan-genome of a mixed popula-
tion of strains potentially encodes a battery of defense systems
that protects the whole population (Bernheim and Sorek 2019).
According to the implications of this model, it would be worth-
while analyzing the possible co-occurrence of RT-containing
defense systems with other immunity systems, to check for
potential crosstalk between antiviral mechanisms. Such studies
would help to unravel the complexity of prokaryotic immunity.
The answers to all these questions would have implications
for the biotechnological applications of RT-containing systems
in new fields, such as phage therapy. It might become possible
to design phages or molecules triggering cell death mediated
by a retron toxin or by DRT/Abi immunity. Furthermore, natural
or engineered phages could be used to overcome RT-mediated
immunity to kill a particular bacterial strain with precision.

tal characterization of novel RT groups and promote additional
lines of research leading to a better understanding of the roles

BOX 1.
Role of group II introns in the origin of eukaryotic life
RTs may have played a key role in the transition from
the simplest RNA molecules to the current DNA world
(Iyer, Koonin and Aravind2003; Mustafin and Khusnutdi-
nova 2019). RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) are
thought to be the evolutionary ancestors of the RT pro-
tein family (Ellefsonet al. 2016; Koonin et al. 2020). There
has been considerable speculation about the evolution of
RTs since the most recent common ancestor (Eickbush
1997; Curcio and Belfort 2007). In this scenario, group II
introns are believed to be one of the drivers of eukary-
otic evolution, as they are considered to be the ancestors
of nuclear spliceosomal introns, non-LTR retrotransposons
and telomerase after colonizing eukaryotes through bac-
terial endosymbionts that evolved into mitochondria and
chloroplasts (Lambowitz and Belfort 2015; Novikova and
Belfort 2017; Haack and Toor2020). It has also been sug-
gestedthatgroupIIintronproliferationinprimitiveeukary-
otic cells may have promoted the formation of a nuclear
envelope to separate splicing from translation (Martin and
Koonin2006).
The spliceosome is an RNP complex, formed by five
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and about 80 proteins, which
eliminates introns from pre-mRNA molecules (Wahl, Will
andL ¨uhrmann2009).ParallelsbetweengroupIIintronsand
spliceosomal introns suggest that the later ones evolved
from group II introns by fragmentation and reassembly
(Chalamcharla, Curcio and Belfort 2010;Q u et al. 2014).
Functionally, both elements require two transesterification
reactions for splicing, with a bulged adenosine involved in
the first step (Lambowitz and Belfort2015). Structurally, the
organization of the active site of the group II intron RNP
is similar to that of the yeast spliceosome (Agrawal, Wang
and Belfort2016;Q uet al.2016), and the architecture of the
maturase domain of various group II introns is similar to
that of Prp8 in the spliceosome complex (Zhao and Pyle
2016). All these similarities suggest a strong relationship
betweengroupIIintronsandthespliceosome.Ontheother
hand,theRTsofgroupIIintrons,non-LTRretrotransposons
and telomerase act through analogous mechanisms, sug-
gesting that ancestral group II introns also gave rise to
these other elements (Eickbush and Malik2002). Once non-
LTR-retrotransposons had evolved from group II introns,
they may have given rise to other more complex retroele-
ments, such as LTR-retrotransposons, through the incorpo-
ration of an integrase. Finally, retroviruses are believed to
have evolved from LTR-elements by incorporating envelope
genes from other viruses (Eickbush and Jamburuthugoda
2008; Finnegan2012).
