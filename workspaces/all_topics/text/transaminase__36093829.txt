ABSTRACT
Highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza viruses (HPAIV), such as H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9, have been reported to frequently
infect humans, but acute encephalitis caused by HPAIV in humans has been rarely reported. We report theﬁrst
critical case of acute encephalitis with mild pneumonia caused by the H5N6 virus. On January 25 of 2022, a
6-year-old girl with severe neurological symptoms was admitted to our hospital and rapidly developed into
seizures and coma. Brain imaging showed abnormalities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) presented abnormal slow
waves. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) contained elevated protein (1.64 g/L) and white cells (546 × 10
6/L). Laboratory
investigations revealed abnormally elevated transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and cytokines in serum. A
novel reassortant H5N6 virus was identi ﬁed from the patient ’s serum, CSF, and tracheal aspirate specimens.
Phylogenic analysis indicated that this virus was a novel reassortant avian-origin in ﬂuenza A (H5N6) virus that
belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b. This patient was diagnosed with acute encephalitis and discharged from the hospital
accompanied by a language barrier. An epidemiological investigation con ﬁrmed that wild waterfowls were the
direct source of infection in this case. Our study highlights the urgent need to pay attention to acute
encephalitis caused by HPAIV.

Introduction
Due to the high lethality in humans, highly pathogenic
avian inﬂuenza viruses (HPAIV), such as H5N1,
H7N9, and H5N6, have posed a great threat to
human health [1–3]. During the past 20 years, the
H5N1 virus has caused 863 cases including 455 deaths
in the world [4]. However, since 2014 the H5N6 reas-
sortant virus has been circulating in poultry and
occasionally infected humans in China [3,5]. To date,
78 cases (32 deaths) of the H5N6 virus have been
reported, of which 77 cases occurred in China [6].
Notably, most cases of H5N6 infection occurred in
2021 and 2022 [5–8]. Diﬀerent from seasonal inﬂuenza,
most patients infected with HPAIV presented primar-
ily with severe respiratory symptoms, and neurological
symptoms associated with acute encephalitis in
humans are still extremely rare. Here, we report the
ﬁrst critical case of acute encephalitis diagnosed by
identifying the H5N6 virus from cerebrospinalﬂuid
(CSF), throat, and serum specimens in a 6-year-old
girl who presented with seizures and coma. The clinical
features of the patient with acute encephalitis are
described and the epidemiological investigation was
established. She was discharged from the hospital, but
brain imaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) still
indicated abnormalities. All evidence indicated the
most likely resource of infection might be the wild
waterfowl. Our study highlights that attention needs
to be paid to viral encephalitis caused by HPAIV
(H5N6) transmitted by migratory birds.

Materials and methods
Clinical data collection
All clinical data about the patient were collected from
illness onset to discharge including clinical signs and
symptoms, chest radiography, chest computed tom-
ography, brain computed tomography, magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI), EEG, clinical laboratory
testing, antiviral or antibacterial treatment, sympto-
matic treatment, supportive care, and intensive care.
After the diagnosis has been identiﬁed, the patient’s
village and house were surveyed. Her family and
other close contacts with potential exposure risks
were identiﬁed and interviewed. An epidemiological
investigation and a risk assessment of these close con-
tacts were evaluated. Written informed consent from
the patient was obtained. The ethics committee of
the a ﬃliated hospital of Yangzhou university
approved this study. The diagnosis for virus isolation
was performed in the biosafety level 3 (BSL3) or the
animal biosafety level 3 facility.
Pathogenic investigation
Blood, urine, CSF, sputum, and tracheal aspirate
specimens were collected on day 6 of the illness
onset for pathogenic bacterial, fungal, and viral iso-
lation and culture. Sera and CSF were collected on
day 7 of illness onset for metagenomic next-gener-
ation sequencing (mNGS) to identify the potential
pathogens [9]. Serum specimens were collected on
day 7 of illness onset and used to examine HBV anti-
gen, HCV antigen, HIV antigen, HIV antibodies,
inﬂuenza A virus H1 and H3 subtype antibodies
(IgM), inﬂuenza B virus antibodies (IgM), Adenovirus
(ADV) antibodies (IgM), respiratory syncytia (RSV)
antibodies (IgM), chlamydia pneumonia antibodies
(IgM), mycoplasma pneumonia antibodies (IgM and
IgG), human parainﬂuenza virus antigen and anti-
bodies (IgM), and EBV antibodies (IgM, IgG, and
IgA) with ELISA. MDCK cells and 10-old-day speciﬁc
pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were
used to isolate the virus, as previously described
[10]. The virus titres were examined with a haemag-
glutination test using chicken red blood cells. Serum
and CSF antibody titres against the H5N6 virus were
measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay according to the standard protocols of OIE [11].
RNA from the serum, CSF, and tracheal aspirate
specimens was extracted with an RNA isolator
(Vazyme, China), according to the manufacturer ’s
instructions. Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed
to cDNA with HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Vazyme, China). Speciﬁc real-time PCR assays for
inﬂuenza A viruses, inﬂuenza B viruses, enteroviruses,
parainﬂuenza viruses, respiratory adenoviruses,
human metapneumoviruses, respiratory syncytial
viruses, human rhinoviruses, human bocaviruses,
SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumoniae, pneumonia
chlamydia, legionella pneumophila, pseudomonas aer-
uginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumo-
niae, group A streptococcus, haemophilus inﬂuenzae,
and
staphylococcus aureus were performed to identify
the potential pathogen. The primers are available on
request. To clarify the potential transmission routes
of this case, epidemiological surveillance for faecal
samples collected from local wild waterfowls was per-
formed by isolating the virus with 10-day-old SPF
embryonated chicken eggs, as previously described
[12].
DNA from the patient’s CSF and sera for mNGS
was extracted using a QIAamp® UCP Pathogen DNA
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA was extracted with a
QIAamp® Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and
was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with reverse tran-
scriptase and dNTPs (Thermo Fisher, USA). Libraries
were constructed for the DNA and cDNA samples
with a Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) [ 9]. Library quality was assessed
with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit or High Sensitivity
DNA kit (Agilent) on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Library pools were then loaded onto an Illumina Next-
seq CN500 sequencer for 75 cycles of paired-end
sequencing to generate approximately 20 million
reads for each library [9,13]. Trimmomatic was used
to remove low-quality reads, adapter contamination,
and duplicate reads, as well as those shorter than
50 bp [14]. Low-complexity reads were removed by
Kcomplexity with default parameters [15]. Human
sequence data were identiﬁed and excluded by map-
ping to a human reference genome (hg38) using Bur-
rows–Wheeler Aligner software [ 16]. Full genome
sequences of the inﬂuenza A virus from the patient
were assembled by megaHIT v1.2.9 [ 17] and the
pathogen complete genome was deposited in the Gen-
ome Warehouse in the National Genomics Data Cen-
ter (National Genomics Data Center Members and
Partners, 2021) under project PRJCA010960, which
are publicly accessible at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa.
For the homologous and phylogenetic analysis, the
resulting sequences were aligned using BLAST with
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
non-redundant nucleotide database [ 18]. All the
sequences of eight segments of the avian inﬂuenza A
virus from Genbank were downloaded. The genomic
coverage graph was drawn by home-made scripts.
Tracheal aspirate specimens, CSF, and serum col-
lected from the patient on day 6 after illness onset
were centrifuged at 12000rpm for 10 min at 4°C to
remove potential bacterial contamination, and then
were inoculated into MDCK cells or 10-day-old SPF
embryonated chicken eggs at 35°C, respectively.

RNA from MDCK cell culture supernatant and chick
embryo allantoicﬂuid was extracted with RNA isola-
tor (Vazyme, China). SpeciﬁcR T–PCR for inﬂuenza
H1 to H15 subtypes was used to verify the viral sub-
type, as previously described [19].
RNA from the patient’s CSF was extracted with
RNA isolator (Vazyme, China), according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions, and was reverse-transcribed
to cDNA with HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Vazyme, China). The full genome of the virus was
ampliﬁed with Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA Poly-
merase (Vazyme, China) and PCR products were pur-
iﬁed from agarose gel with the Wizard® SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, USA) and were
sent to Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) for sequen-
cing. Full genome sequences of the virus were sub-
mitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian
Inﬂuenza Data database (accession number
EPI2042509-16) and National Center for Biotechnol-
ogy Information (accession number OP209766-73).
A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on
the ORF of each segment of the selected inﬂuenza A
viruses was constructed with MEGA7.0 and the high-
est identity to known strains was analyzed with
DNAStar. The universal primer sets for full genome
sequencing were described by Hoﬀumann et al [20].
Results
Case report
On January 20, 2022, fever, headache, dizziness, walk-
ing instability, and sleep increase were observed in a
previously healthy 6-year-old girl with a maximal
39.1°C body temperature but no apparent respiratory
symptoms. After treatment with antibiotics for one
day, her symptoms have not improved, her fever per-
sisted, and her body temperatureﬂuctuated at 39.0-
40.0°C. On Jan 21, 2022, she was admitted at a local
hospital with a suspected bacterial infection and trea-
ted with azithromycin, penicillin, cefoperazone, or cef-
tazidime for 3 days. However, she still had a persistent
fever with a body temperature of up to 41.0°C with no
improvement at all, and she became lethargic. On Jan
25, 2022, she rapidly developed symptoms typical of
acute encephalitis including lethargy, impassive and
mask-like face, limb weakness, vertigo, tremours,
aphasia, torticollis, opisthotonus, epileptic seizures,
and convulsion. Therefore, she was urgently trans-
ferred to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of
the aﬃliated hospital of Yangzhou university (Figure
1A). On admission, she rapidly progressed to seizures
and coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score, 7) and devel-
oped frequent apnoea and irregular breathing with
low oxygen saturation, and was commenced non-
invasive mechanical ventilation (Supplementary
Tables). Physical examination revealed that positive
for Brudzinski’s sign and bilateral Babinski ’s sign,
but negative for Kernig’s sign. Haematological exam-
ination revealed a signiﬁcant increase in white cell
(21.45 × 10
9 cells/L), neutrophils (18.31 × 109 cells/L),
and lymphmonocytes (1.28 × 109 cells/L) (Table 1).
Blood biochemical parameters showed that markedly
elevated alanine aminotransferase (68 U/L), aspartate
aminotransferase (132 U/L), γ-glutamyl transpepti-
dase (143 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1041 U/L), cre-
atine kinase (269 U/L), and creatine kinase isoenzyme
(294.9 U/L) (Table 1). Chest radiograph indicated
bilateral patchy shadows with consolidation in the
right lung upper lobe (Figure 1B). Chest computed
tomography showed consolidation of the right lung
upper lobe and mild consolidation of the bilateral
lower lobe (Figure 1C and D). MRI showed obvious
abnormal signals in the right parietal lobe, bilateral
frontal lobe, insula, and temporo-occipital lobe on
the di ﬀusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (ADC) images, and T2ﬂuid-atte-
nuated inversion-recovery (T2-FLAIR) images (Figure
2A). EEG presented the relative enhanced θ and δ
activities (Figure 2B). A lumbar puncture was per-
formed, and CSF on day 6 of the illness was examined.
CSF contained 2 × 10
6/L of red blood cells, 546 × 106/L
of white cells (mononuclear cells dominant), and
1.291 g/L of protein (Supplementary Tables). Cyto-
kine examination for the patient ’s serum revealed
that the levels of interleukins (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5,
IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12P70), interferon- α (IFN-α),
tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were signiﬁcantly
elevated (Table 1).
Clinical treatment
Before the main causative pathogen was identiﬁed, the
patient was treated empirically with broad-spectrum
antibiotics for antimicrobial therapy due to elevated
serum procalcitonin. The patient received intrave-
nously 20 mg of meropenem per kilogram of body
weight per 8 h (20 mg/kg/8 h) from day 5 to day 13
of illness onset and 10 mg/kg/6 h of vancomycin
from day 6 to day 13 of illness onset and then changed
to ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) treatment from day 13
to day 17 of illness onset. Due to suspected viral ence-
phalitis, the patient was treated empirically with acy-
clovir (10 mg/kg/8 h) for antiviral therapy before the
pathogen has been determined. After con ﬁrming
that the pathogen is the H5N6 virus, the patient was
changed to treat intravenously with 150 mg/day of
peramivir for 3 days. To improve immunity, the
patient received intravenously 2 times of human
gamma globulin (2 g/kg) treatment on day 5 to day
7, and day 9 to day 10 of the illness. In addition, the
patient received intravenously 20 mg of methylpredni-
solone per 12 h for 4 days, 340 mg of methylpredniso-
lone per day for 3 days, and 17 mg of
Emerging Microbes & Infections 2439
methylprednisolone per 2 h for 7 days. To reduce the
patient’s intracranial pressure, the patient was treated
with 25% mannitol for 8 days from day 5 to day 13 of
the illness. Due to the frequent occurrence of convul-
sions and epilepsy, the patient was treated with mida-
zolam from day 4 to day 15 of the illness, and

unit; CSF, cerebrospinalﬂuid. Chest radiography (Day 6 of illness) indicated bilateral patchy shadows with consolidation in the
right lung upper lobe (Panel B). Chest computed tomography showed consolidation of the right lung upper lobe (Panel C)
and mild consolidation of the bilateral lower lobe near the pleura (Panel D).

oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam were added from day
5 to day 15 of the illness. Mechanical ventilation was
removed on day 15 of the illness and nasogastric feed-
ing was stopped on day 30. Brain MRI on day 28 of ill-
ness still showed abnormal signals including gyri-like
hyperintensities in the bilateral frontotemporal parie-
tal occipital lobes on the diﬀusion-weighted imaging
(T1WI), slightly hyperintensities in the bilateral fron-
totemporal parietal occipital lobes and patchy hyper-
intensities in the anterior and posterior horns of
bilateral ventricles on the T2ﬂuid-attenuated inver-
sion-recovery (T2-FLAIR) images, patchy and gyri-
like hypointense signals in the right parietal and tem-
poral lobes on the apparent di ﬀusion coe ﬃcient
(ADC) images (Figure 3), indicating that the brain
injury has not fully recovered. EEG on day 31 of illness
still presented the relative enhancedθ and δ activities
on the left side, including a slow background, continu-
ous left-right asymmetry, scattered multifocal slow
wave discharges on the left side during the stage of
waking and sleeping, and a small number of slow
waves as a background activity with spike, sharp, or
slow wave complex on the left central, top, and tem-
poral regions at the stage of the sleeping period
(Figure 3), indicating abnormal brain waves. The girl
was discharged from the hospital on day 32 of illness
onset (26 February). Except for that language
expression, memory, voluntary urination and defaeca-
tion have not yet fully recovered, no other apparent
neurological or developmental delay was observed
during follow-up two to four months after discharge.
But 6 months later she shows obvious features of
brain atrophy.
Pathogen investigation
No pathogenic bacteria or fungi were isolated from the
blood, urine, and CSF. mNGS for the patient’s serum
and CSF indicated no bacterial, fungal, or parasitic
infections. SARS-CoV-2, HBV antigen, HCV antigen,
HIV antigen, HIV antibodies, inﬂuenza A virus H1
and H3 subtype antibodies IgM, inﬂuenza B virus
antibodies IgM, Adenovirus (ADV) antibodies IgM,
RSV antibodies IgM, and chlamydia pneumonia anti-
bodies IgM were negative. Mycoplasma pneumonia
antibodies IgM was negative, but MP antibodies IgG
was 172.00 AU/ml, much higher than the normal
range. Human parainﬂuenza virus (HPIV) antibodies
IgM was positive, but HPIV antigen was negative.
EBV antibodies IgM and IgA were negative, but
EBV antibodies IgG was positive. The result of RT–
PCR from the patient’s serum, CSF, and throat speci-
mens indicated H5N6 positive, but negative for
twenty-one other respiratory pathogens including sea-
sonal inﬂuenza A viruses (H1, H3, or B). The virus was
also isolated from the tracheal aspirate specimens col-
lected on day 7 of illness onset. The mNGS data from
the CSF and serum collected on day 7 revealed that

day 6 of the illness showed obvious abnormal signals on DWI (abnormally hyperintensity in the left insula and parietal lobe), ADC
(abnormally hypointensity in the left insula and parietal lobe), and T2-FLAIR images (slightly hyperintensity in the left insula lobe)
(marked with an arrow). Panel B: EEG on day 6 of the illness presented the relative enhancedθ and δ activities with the continuous
asymmetrical low waves manifested spike, sharp, or slow wave complex (marked with a black line).

avian inﬂuenza A H5N6 virus was the overwhelmingly
microbial species (Figure 4). Virus isolation from the
CSF and serum also con ﬁrmed the above results.
The CSF and serum contained infectious virus titres
of 10
2.5 TCID50/50 µl and 101.0TCID50/50 µl, respect-
ively. A novel reassortant H5N6 was designated as
A/Yangzhou/125/2022 (YZ125) isolated from the
patient’s CSF and was used for further analysis. The
haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres of
the serum and CSF against the YZ125 virus was 256
and 4, respectively. All evidence indicated that the
H5N6 virus was considered the most likely pathogen.
Phylogenic and mutation analysis
Phylogenic analysis indicated that the YZ125 virus was
a novel reassortant H5N6 virus that belonged to clade
2.3.4.4b ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures).
Although no known H5N6 genomes completely
matched our sequences, the eight genes of YZ125
shared the highest identity (99.3–100%) with A/Hang-
zhou/1/2021 (H5N6) or A/duck/Zhejiang/S4854/2021
(H5N6) (Supplementary Tables). The HA cleavage site
of the YZ125 virus contains a multiple basic amino
acids motif of HPAIV (PLREKRRKR/G). The amino
acid motif at residues 226–228 (H3 numbering) in
HA was Gln-Ser-Gly, suggesting its preference for an
avian-like receptor [21]. However, the receptor-bind-
ing site Thr160Ala mutation might enhance aﬃnity
with the human-type receptor. A deletion of 12
amino acids at positions 59–70 in the NA stalk and
5 amino acids at positions 80–84 in the NS1 associated
with increased virulence in mice were observed [22].
Furthermore, many mutations in the internal genes
associated with enhanced virulence in mice, including
Leu89Val, Gly309Asp, Thr339Lys, Arg477Gly, Ile495
Val, Ala676Thr in PB2 [23], Ser622Gly in PB1[24],
Ser515Thr in PA [25], Asn30Asp, Thr215Ala, Ile43-
Met in M1 [26,27], Pro42Ser [28], Val149Ala [29],
Cys138Leu [30], Leu103Phe [31], Ile106Met [32]i n
NS1 were revealed (Supplementary Tables). No
mutations associated with drug resistance were
found in the M2 and NA proteins.In vitro antiviral
tests from the MDCK cell infection model also
conﬁrmed that the EC
50 of oseltamivir and peramivir
on the YZ125 virus was approximately 0.14 µg/ml and
1.4 ng/ml, respectively, suggesting that the YZ125
virus remains sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors.
Epidemiological investigation
After the diagnosis has been done, the patient’s village
and house were surveyed. Her family and neighbours
were interviewed. The family lives in a small village
next to the Baita River nearby the Yangtze River.
There is a large inner lake connected to the Baita
River in front of her house. Many wild waterfowl
and domestic ducks are living together in the lake.
Before the illness onset, she often liked to go to the
lake for watching wild waterfowl and domestic
ducks. Even in her house, wild bird droppings can
be seen everywhere. Moreover, during the illness
onset, her pet dog died and she had close contact
with the dog, but no epidemiological diagnosis for
the pet dog was done. Her family has no poultry and
did not handle poultry from markets. No signs of
inﬂuenza-like symptoms in all close contacts were
observed during her illness. However, due to the
slaughter of domestic ducks and the burial of pet
dogs, no direct evidence of H5N6 virus infection was
obtained from the above samples. Notably, 4 months
after the occurrence of the case, one HPAI (H5N6)
virus highly homologous to the YZ125 (H5N6) virus
was isolated from the faeces of local wild waterfowls
where the case occurred, suggesting that wild water-
fowls may be the direct source of this infection.
Discussion
Inﬂuenza A virus is primarily limited to the respirat-
ory system, but many of the reported cases of
inﬂuenza A viruses, including the “1918 H1N1 ”
inﬂuenza pandemic, had neurological symptoms typi-
cal of encephalitis, which can result in severe neuro-
logical sequelae and even death [33,34]. Inﬂuenza-
associated encephalitis and encephalopathy (IAE)
caused by inﬂuenza A H3N2 or H1N1 are most fre-
quently reported in children although adult cases are
described [34,35]. However, acute neurological symp-
toms from mild encephalitis to motor disturbances to
coma caused by HPAIV have been observed mainly in
poultry and wild mammals [36,37]. In addition, most
patients infected by HPAIV, including H5N1, H5N6,
and H7N9, exhibit primarily acute respiratory illness,
and rarely neurological symptoms have been reported
[1–3]. To date, there are only 3 case reports of H5N1
infections with encephalitis, but only one fatal case
was conﬁrmed by isolating the H5N1 virus from the
stored CSF [38,39]. However, due to no increase in
white cells in CSF and the lack of brain imaging, it
cannot conclusively determine whether the patient
had true encephalitis [39]. Virological diagnosis is a
prerequisite for determining whether AIE occurs. To
the best of our knowledge, most reports of IAE were
mainly based on the detection of inﬂuenza A virus
RNA from CSF with rare evidence of isolating
inﬂuenza A virus [33,34]. In addition, excessive cyto-
kine storm was observed in most patients with IAE
[33]. Therefore, the current prevailing theory is that
IAE might be associated with hypercytokinaemia
rather than actual viral invasion. However, the patho-
genic mechanisms of IAE remain largely unknown. In
this study, our results clearly indicated that the
patient’s acute encephalitis was caused by an H5N6
Emerging Microbes & Infections 2443
virus infection. The diagnosis of acute encephalitis was
based on the following evidence: neurological symp-
toms, brain imaging, EEG, biochemical characteristics
of CSF and serum specimens, serology analysis, and
virus isolation. The virological diagnosis was
conﬁrmed by RT–PCR, mNGS, and virus isolation
from serum, CSF, and throat-swab specimens. Due
to the identiﬁcation of pathogens in all clinical speci-
mens performed by diﬀerent staﬀ at separate places
on diﬀerent dates apart (Yangzhou Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, Vision Medicals Co. Ltd
(Guangzhou, China), and Yangzhou University), the
possibility of laboratory contamination can be com-
pletely ruled out. On-goingin vivo work will reveal
the potential pathogenesis of viral encephalitis caused
by this virus.
In previously reported cases of IAE, clinical symp-
toms of inﬂuenza include but are not limited to fever,
headache, pharyngitis, and myalgia [ 33,34,40].This
particular patient had symptoms of fever, headache,
dizziness, vomiting, walking instability, language
reduction, and sleep increase with elevated white
cells and neutrophils, but had no obvious respiratory
symptoms on illness onset. Therefore, it may be sus-
pected as bacterial infection on illness onset. However,
after 5 days of antibiotic treatment, not only did her
symptoms not improve signi ﬁcantly but instead
rapidly progressed to typical symptoms of encephalitis,
such as convulsions, epilepsy, and coma. Therefore,
acute encephalitis was suspected, and antiviral therapy
was given empirically with acyclovir. After the diagno-
sis of H5N6 virus infection, the patient was changed to
peramivir treatment. In the previous literature, steroid
pulse therapy in the acute phase of IAE has beneﬁcial
eﬀects on patient morbidity and mortality [41,42]. In
view of excessive cytokines storms in sera, she received
steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. In
addition, our experience suggests that the specialized
supportive therapies of PICU including mechanical
ventilation, early convulsion control, reduction of cra-
nial pressure and oedema, anti-epileptic treatment,
ﬂuid management, and nutritional support may play
an important role in the improvement of the prognosis
of this case. Therefore, our research will provide a
reference for clinicians, virologists, and public health
experts to guide clinical treatment, laboratory diagno-
sis, and epidemiological surveillance for this potential
pandemic disease.
Due to the patient’s family neither raised poultry
nor slaughtered poultry, the possibility of exposure
to ill poultry should be ruled out. Moreover, long-
term epidemiologic surveillance from our lab indi-
cated that there was no this novel H5N6 reassortant
circulating in poultry in Yangzhou city. Additionally,

tide substitutions per site.

there were large amounts of wild waterfowl and dom-
estic ducks living together in the inner lake in front of
the patient’s house, we speculate that the most likely
source of transmission might be wild waterfowl over-
wintering in the lake. The above speculation is further
supported by the latest epidemiological reports,
suggesting that these novel H5N6 reassortants includ-
ing A/Hangzhou/1/2021 and A/duck/Zhejiang/S4854/
2021, which are most closely related to the YZ125
virus, may be generated through reassortment
between migratory wild birds and domestic ducks.
Recently, we isolated one H5N6 virus shared with
highly homologous to the YZ125 (H5N6) virus from
the faeces of wild waterfowl where the patient lives,
further conﬁrming the above speculation. Moreover,
it is worth noting that this YZ125-like virus has suc-
cessively infected humans in Guangxi, Hunan, Zhe-
jiang, and Jiangsu provinces since 2021[ 5–7,43],
suggesting that these novel reassortants H5N6 viruses
might get the ability to directly infect human without
adaption. Because the clinical manifestations of this
novel H5N6 reassortant are acute encephalitis, rather
than previous respiratory symptoms, once these reas-
sortants obtained the ability of human-to-human
transmission through reassortment or mutations, it
will bring great health threat to humans. Therefore,
it is a very urgent need to enhance the epidemiological
surveillance of wild waterfowl and to take eﬀective
measures to prevent close contact between wild water-
fowl and poultry in areas where migratory birds fre-
quently migrate.
