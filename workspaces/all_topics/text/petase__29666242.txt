Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly
produced synthetic polymers and is accumulating in the environ-
ment at a staggering rate as discarded packaging and textiles. The
properties that make PET so useful also endow it with an alarming
resistance to biodegradation, likely lasting centuries in the envi-
ronment. Our collective reliance on PET and other plastics means
that this buildup will continue unless solutions are found. Re-
cently, a newly discovered bacterium,Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6,
was shown to exhibit the rare ability to grow on PET as a major
carbon and energy source. Central to its PET biodegradation capa-
bility is a secreted PETase (PET-digesting enzyme). Here, we pre-
sent a 0.92 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of PETase, which
reveals features common to both cutinases and lipases. PETase
retains the ancestralα/β-hydrolase fold but exhibits a more open
active-site cleft than homologous cutinases. By narrowing the
binding cleft via mutation of two active-site residues to conserved
amino acids in cutinases, we surprisingly observe improved PET
degradation, suggesting that PETase is not fully optimized for crys-
talline PET degradation, despite presumably evolving in a PET-rich
environment. Additionally, we show that PETase degrades another
semiaromatic polyester, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF),
which is an emerging, bioderived PET replacement with improved
barrier properties. In contrast, PETase does not degrade aliphatic
polyesters, suggesting that it is generally an aromatic polyesterase.
These findings suggest that additional protein engineering to in-
crease PETase performance is realistic and highlight the need for
further developments of structure/activity relationships for bio-
degradation of synthetic polyesters.

n less than a century of manufacturing, plastics have become
essential to modern society, driven by their incredible versatility
coupled to low production costs. It is, however, now widely rec-
ognized that plastics pose a dire global pollution threat, especially
in marine ecosystems, because ofthe ultralong lifetimes of most
synthetic plastics in the environment (1–9). In response to the ac-
cumulation of plastics in the biosphere, it is becoming increasingly
recognized that microbes are adapting and evolving enzymes and
catabolic pathways to partially degrade man-made plastics as car-
bon and energy sources (10–19). These evolutionary footholds of-
fer promising starting points for industrial biotechnology and
synthetic biology to help address the looming environmental threat
posed by man-made synthetic plastics (19–23).
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most abundant
polyester plastic manufactured in the world. Most applications
that employ PET, such as single-use beverage bottles, clothing,
packaging, and carpeting, employ crystalline PET, which is
recalcitrant to catalytic or biological depolymerization due to the
limited accessibility of the ester linkages. In an industrial context,
PET can be depolymerized to its constituents via chemistries able to
cleave ester bonds (24, 25). However, to date, few chemical recy-
cling solutions have been deployed, given the high processing costs
relative to the purchase of inexpensive virgin PET. This, in turn,
results in reclaimed PET primarily being mechanically recycled,
ultimately resulting in a loss of material properties, and hence in-
trinsic value. Given the recalcitrance of PET, the fraction of this
plastic stream that is landfilled or makes its way to the environment
is projected to persist for hundreds of years (1).
In 2016, Yoshida et al. (17) reported a newly discovered
bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, with the unusual ability
to use PET as its major carbon and energy source for growth.
Especially in the past decade, there have been multiple, foun-
dational studies reporting enzymes that can degrade PET (10,
26–31), but, to our knowledge, previous work had not connected
Significance
Synthetic polymers are ubiquitous in the modern world but
pose a global environmental problem. While plastics such as
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are highly versatile, their
resistance to natural degradation presents a serious, growing
risk to fauna and flora, particularly in marine environments.
Here, we have characterized the 3D structure of a newly dis-
covered enzyme that can digest highly crystalline PET, the
primary material used in the manufacture of single-use plastic
beverage bottles, in some clothing, and in carpets. We engi-
neer this enzyme for improved PET degradation capacity and
further demonstrate that it can also degrade an important PET
replacement, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate, providing
new opportunities for biobased plastics recycling.

extracellular enzymatic PET degradation to catabolism (11) in a
single microbe. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Yoshida et al. (17)
demonstrated that an I. sakaiensis enzyme dubbed PETase
(PET-digesting enzyme) converts PET to mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET), with trace amounts of terephthalic
acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA as secondary products.
A second enzyme, MHETase (MHET-digesting enzyme), further
converts MHET into the two monomers, TPA and ethylene
glycol (EG). Both enzymes are secreted byI. sakaiensisand likely
act synergistically to depolymerize PET. Sequence analysis and
recent structural studies of PETase highlight similarities to
α/β-hydrolase enzymes (17, 32, 33), including the cutinase and
lipase families, which catalyze hydrolysis of cutin and fatty acids,
respectively. This observation provides clues to the origin of
PETase, but further insights into its structural and functional
evolution are needed.
Beyond PET, humankind uses a wide range of polyesters,
broadly classified by aliphatic and aromatic content. PET, for
example, is a semiaromatic polyester. Some aliphatic polyesters,
such as polylactic acid (PLA) (34), polybutylene succinate (PBS)
(35), or polyhydroxyalkanoates (36), can be produced from re-
newable sources and are marketed as biodegradable plastics, given
their relatively low crystallinity and glass transition temperatures,
in turn, providing relatively more direct enzymatic access to ester
linkages. Aromatic and semiaromatic polyesters, conversely, of-
ten exhibit enhanced thermal and material properties and, ac-
cordingly, have reached substantially higher market volume but
are typically not as biodegradable as their aliphatic counterparts.
An emerging, biobased PET replacement is polyethylene-2,5-
furandicarboxylate [or poly(ethylene furanoate); PEF], which is
based on sugar-derived 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) (37).
PEF exhibits improved gas barrier properties over PET and is
being pursued industrially (38). Even though PEF is a biobased
semiaromatic polyester, which is predicted to offset greenhouse
gas emissions relative to PET (39), its lifetime in the environ-
ment, like that of PET, is likely to be quite long (40). Given that
PETase has evolved to degrade crystalline PET, it potentially
may have promiscuous activity across a range of polyesters.
In this study, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the
adaptations that contribute to the substrate specificity of PETase.
To this end, we report multiple high-resolution X-ray crystal
structures of PETase, which enable comparison with known
cutinase structures. Based on differences in the PETase and a
homologous cutinase active-site cleft (41), PETase variants were
produced and tested for PET degradation, including a double
mutant distal to the catalytic center that we hypothesized would
alter important substrate-binding interactions. Surprisingly, this
double mutant, inspired by cutinase architecture, exhibits im-
proved PET degradation capacity relative to wild-type PETase.
We subsequently employed in silico docking and molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations to characterize PET binding and dy-
namics, which provide insights into substrate binding and suggest
an explanation for the improved performance of the PETase
double mutant. Additionally, incubation of wild-type and mutant
PETase with several polyesters was examined using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and product release. These studies showed that the en-
zyme can degrade both crystalline PET (17) and PEF, but not
aliphatic polyesters, suggesting a broader ability to degrade
semiaromatic polyesters. Taken together, the structure/function
relationships elucidated here could be used to guide further
protein engineering to more effectively depolymerize PET and
other synthetic polymers, thus informing a biotechnological
strategy to help remediate the environmental scourge of plastic
accumulation in nature (19–23).
Results
PETase Exhibits a Canonical α/β-Hydrolase Structure with an Open
Active-Site Cleft. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of
the I. sakaiensisPETase was solved employing a newly developed
synchrotron beamline capable of long-wavelength X-ray crystal-
lography (42). Using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion,
phases were obtained from the native sulfur atoms present in the
protein. The low background from the in vacuo setup and large
curved detector resulted in exceptional diffraction data quality
extending to a resolution of 0.92 Å, with minimal radiation
damage (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1).
As predicted from the sequence homology to the lipase and
cutinase families, PETase adopts a classicalα/β-hydrolase fold,
with a core consisting of eightβ-strands and sixα-helices (Fig.
2A). Yoshida et al. (17) noted that PETase has close sequence
identity to bacterial cutinases, withThermobifida fusca cutinase
being the closest known structural representative (with 52% se-
quence identity; Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), which is an
enzyme that also degrades PET (26, 29, 41). Despite a conserved
fold, the surface profile is quite different between the two en-
zymes. PETase has a highly polarized surface charge (Fig. 2C),
creating a dipole across the molecule and resulting in an overall
isoelectric point (pI) of 9.6. In contrast,T. fusca cutinase, in
common with other cutinases, has a number of small patches of
both acidic and basic residues distributed over the surface,
conferring a more neutral pI of 6.3 (Fig. 2D).
Another striking difference between PETase and the closest
cutinase homologs is the broader active-site cleft, which, upon
observation, we hypothesized might be necessary to accommo-
date crystalline semiaromatic polyesters. At its widest point, the
cleft in PETase approaches threefold the width of the corre-
sponding structure in the T. fusca cutinase. The expansion is
achieved with minimal rearrangement of the adjacent loops and
secondary structure (Fig. 2E and F). A single amino acid sub-
stitution from phenylalanine to serine in the lining of the active-
site cavity appears sufficient to cause this change, with the
remaining cleft formed between Trp159 and Trp185 (Fig. 2G).
This relative broadening of the active-site cleft is also observed in
comparisons with other known cutinase structures (SI Appendix,
Fig. S3A–D).
In terms of the active site, the well-studied catalytic triad is
conserved across the lipases and cutinase families (43). In
PETase, the catalytic triad comprises Ser160, Asp206, and
His237, suggesting a charge-relay system similar to that found in
other α/β-fold hydrolases (44). The specific location and geom-
etry between the active site found in cutinases is also conserved
in PETase (Fig. 2G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In common
with most lipases, the catalytic residues reside on loops, with the
nucleophilic serine occupying a highly conserved position known
Fig. 1. PETase catalyzes the depolymerization of PET to bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-
TPA (BHET), MHET, and TPA. MHETase converts MHET to TPA and EG.

as the nucleophilic elbow (45). The nucleophilic serine sits in
the consensus sequence (Gly-X1-Ser-X2-Gly), and while this
“lipase box” i sc o m m o nt om o s tl i p a s e s(SI Appendix,F i g .S 4A)
and cutinases (SI Appendix,F i g .S 4B), the X1 position, usually
occupied by a histidine or phenylalanine in cutinases and li-
pases, contains a tryptophan residue, Trp159, in PETase (46)
(Fig. 2G). This residue has the effect of extending the hydro-
phobic surface adjacent to the active site (SI Appendix,F i g .S 3
E and F). In common with the Fusarium solani cutinase,
PETase has two disulfide bonds, one adjacent to the active site
and one near the C terminus of the protein. MD simulations
have predicted that the active-site disulfide inF. solanicutinase
is important for active-site stability, and it may play a similar
role in PETase (47).
To explore the potential effects of crystallization conditions
and packing effects, three additional crystallography datasets
ranging in resolution from 1.58 to 1.80 Å provided a total of
seven independent PETase chains (SI Appendix, Table S1). All
domains adopt the same fold (relative rmsd values are∼0.28 Å),
and all of the residues of the catalytic triad exhibit the
same conformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 A and B), including
Trp159. In one crystal form, however, Trp185 was present in
three distinct conformations, all with higher B-factors than other
residues in the putative binding cleft; these results were cor-
roborated by MD simulations of the wild-type PETase (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S5C–F). In all crystal forms, the packing of PETase
involves extensive packing interactions in and around the hy-
drophobic cleft, resulting in little space for interaction with
putative ligands.
Converting PETase to a Cutinase-Like Active-Site Cleft Enables
Improved Crystalline PET Degradation. From the PETase struc-
ture, we originally hypothesized that changes in the active site
relative to theT. fuscacutinase resulted from the evolution ofI.
sakaiensis in a PET-containing environment, thus enabling more
efficient PET depolymerization. To test this hypothesis, we
mutated the PETase-active site to make it more cutinase-like.
Specifically, a double mutant was produced, S238F/W159H,
which, based on homology modeling, was predicted to narrow
the PETase active site, similar to theT. fusca cutinase. Addi-
tionally, we produced the W185A mutant to examine the role of
this highly conserved dynamic residue.
In the original report describing the discovery of PETase,
Yoshida et al. (17) examined PETase digestions of amorphous
PET films with a crystallinity of 1.9%, which is lower than that of
most PET samples that would be encountered either in the en-
vironment or in an industrial recycling context (48). To examine
the performance in the wild-type PETase relative to the two
mutants, we examined PET digestion with coupons of higher
crystallinity. Specifically, PET coupons with an initial crystallinity
of 14.8 ± 0.2% (for reference, a commercial soft drink bottle
examined via the same methods exhibits a crystallinity of 15.7%
as measured by DSC) were synthesized and characterized by
NMR spectroscopy to confirm their structure and by DSC to
determine their crystallinity (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). Digestions
were conducted at pH 7.2 and monitored with DSC, NMR
spectroscopy, and SEM, and reaction products were quantified
by HPLC and NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 3A–D shows the results
of PET degradation, including a buffer-only control, the wild-
type PETase, and the double mutant. It is clear that PETase
induces surface erosion and pitting of a PET film with a crys-
tallinity of 13.3± 0.2%, resulting in a 10.1% relative crystallinity
reduction (absolute reduction of 1.5%;SI Appendix, Table S2).
Surprisingly, the PETase double mutant outperforms the wild-
type PETase by both crystallinity reduction and product release.
The absolute crystallinity loss is 4.13% higher, and the corre-
sponding SEM images appear to show that slightly more surface
ablation occurs (Fig. 3C). After incubation, the digested PET
samples for both the wild-type PETase and the double mutant
exhibit a lower melting temperature over a wider temperature

range (SI Appendix, Fig. S6F), indicating that the crystalline
domain regions are reduced in size.
Understanding how PET binds in the PETase catalytic site is
key to understanding the improved performance of the PETase
double mutant. We attempted multiple trials to obtain a ligand-
bound structure of PETase, to no avail. While this paper was in
revision, Han et al. (32) published a study with an R132G/S160A
mutant (R132 and S160 in the numbering here) that was able to
accommodate monomeric ligands, alongside the publication of
another PETase structure soon after (33). Here, we sought to
predict PET-PETase binding modes by conducting induced fit
docking (IFD) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Multiple PET orienta-
tions were predicted by IFD in and around the active site of both
the wild-type and double-mutant enzymes. The orientation
shown in Fig. 3E and SI Appendix, Fig. S7A is one of several used
to illustrate a productive PET-binding event in the wild-type
enzyme: A PET carbonyl carbon is at a chemically relevant dis-
tance (5.1 Å) for nucleophilic attack from the Ser160 hydroxyl
group (49, 50), His237 is at an ideal distance (3.9 Å) to activate
Ser160, and Asp206 provides hydrogen bonding support to
His237 (2.8 Å). This binding mode is predicted to have binding
affinity (estimated by the docking score with descriptors inSI
Appendix, Table S3)o f−8.23 kcal/mol. Thus, our IFD-predicted
binding modes are consistent with a productive Michaelis com-
plex for PET chain cleavage. Additionally, with this low-energy,
catalytically competent pose generated from flexible docking
(i.e., IFD), we observe a marked difference in the position of
Trp185 compared with the crystal structure (SI Appendix, Fig.
S7I). The N-Cα-Cβ-C dihedral in the crystal PETase structure
is −177.5°, whereas our predicted catalytically competent binding
mode of PET indicates W185 rotates to accommodate aromatic
interactions with PET, and thus adopts a dihedral angle of 98.4°.
This dihedral rotation was observed to various extents in all
docking results and in apo MD simulations (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5F), and thus illustrates the necessity for flexible protein
treatment during ligand binding mode prediction, especially if
binding and/or catalytic hypotheses are to be posited.
IFD results also suggest potential reasons for the improved
performance of the PETase doublemutant over wild-type PETase,
as the substrate may interact with Phe238 through several aromatic

optimum position for the interaction of the carbon (black) with the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Ser160, at a distance of 5.1 Å (red dash). His237 is po-
sitioned within 3.9 Å of the Ser160 hydroxyl (green dash). Residues Trp159 and Ser238 line the active-site channel (orange and blue, respectively). (F) Double
mutant S238F/W159H adopts a more productive interaction with PET. The S238 mutation provides newπ-stacking and hydrophobic interactions to adjacent
terephthalate moieties, while the conversion to His159 from the bulkier Trp allows the PET polymer to sit deeper within the active-site channel. Two aromatic
interactions of interest between PET and Phe238 are at optimal distance (each at 5.4 Å).

interactions, as shown in Fig. 3F. In this predicted pose (docking
score of−11.25 kcal/mol, with descriptors inSI Appendix, Table
S3), a PET carbonyl is at an appropriate attack distance from
Ser160 (3.1 Å), Ser160 is in the range for deprotonation by
His237 (2.9 Å;SI Appendix, Fig. S7C), and Asp206 is ready to
accept a proton in the shuttle (2.9 Å). PET aromatic rings are
within ideal π-stacking distances (51) to binding site residues
(W185 and Y87), and, in particular, two aromatic interactions
are formed to Phe238 (point-to-face interaction at 5.4 Å and
parallel displaced interaction at 5.4 Å). The marked difference in
predicted binding affinities between wild-type and double-
mutant enzymes for PET is consistent with the increased activity
of the PETase double mutant on PET, as observed experimentally,
and we can identify aromatic interactions supported by the S238F
mutation as being integral to this enhancement. All aromatic ring-
ring distances for described binding modes are illustrated inSI
Appendix,F i g .S 7A and C.
In contrast to the double mutant, the W185A mutant exhibits
highly impaired performance relative to the wild-type PETase, as
described inSI Appendix, Fig. S5G–J and Table S2. These data
confirm a critical role for this residue. From the IFD, Trp185 is
predicted to play an important role by contributingπ-stacking
interactions to PET aromatic groups. Additionally, in all pro-
ductive binding modes (i.e., when the carbonyl is oriented to be
in the oxyanion hole and the carbonyl carbon is at a catalytic
distance from Ser160), Trp185 is predicted to reorient relative to
the crystal structure, suggesting its movement opens the active-
site cleft, allowing PET binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S7I).
PETase Depolymerizes PEF, but Not Aliphatic Polyesters.We were
also interested in understanding the activity of wild-type PETase
and the PETase double mutant on other polymeric substrates,
including aliphatic and other semiaromatic polyesters. To that
end, we synthesized, characterized (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C and
D), and conducted similar incubations with the aliphatic poly-
esters PBS and PLA. None of these samples showed visual dif-
ferences between the control images and the PETase-treated

reaction product concentration (FDCA, blue diagonal lines) after incubation with buffer, wild-type PETase, and the S238F/W159H double mutant. (E) Pre-
dicted binding conformations of wild-type PETase from docking simulations demonstrate that PEF is accommodated in an optimum position for the in-
teraction of the carbon (black) with the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of Ser160, at a distance of 5.0 Å (red dash). His237 is positioned within 3.7 Å of the
Ser160 hydroxyl (green dash). Residues Trp159 (orange) and Ser238 (blue) line the active-site channel. (F) In contrast, the double mutant S238F/W159H
significantly alters the architecture of the catalytic site for PEF binding. Residue His237 rotates away from Ser160, and instead forms an aromatic interaction
with PEF chain at 5.1 Å. Surprisingly, the mutated His159 becomes an alternative productive H-bond partner at 3.2 Å. Similar to interactions with PET,
Phe238 also provides additional hydrophobic interactions to an adjacent furan ring of the extended PEF polymer, creating a more intimate binding mode
with the cleft, with a parallel displaced aromatic interaction at 5.2 Å.

samples (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), suggesting that PETase and the
double mutant are not active on aliphatic polyesters.
PEF is another semiaromatic polyester marketed as a bio-
based PET replacement (38, 39). Given the structural similarity
of PET and PEF, and recent studies on PEF degradation by
cutinases (52), we hypothesized that PETase may also de-
polymerize this substrate. Accordingly, we synthesized PEF
coupons, and Fig. 4A–D shows the results of PEF incubations
with the wild-type PETase enzyme and the PETase double mu-
tant, alongside a buffer-only control. Visually, the surface mor-
phology of PETase-treated PEF is even more modified than
PET, with SEM revealing the formation of large pits, suggesting
that PETase is potentially much more active on this substrate
than PET. The observation of enhanced PEF degradation by
microscopy is corroborated by the DSC data for PEF, which
show a reduction in relative crystallinity of 15.7% (absolute of
2.4%) compared with a relative reduction of 10.1% for PET (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6E and Table S2).

and double-mutant PETase-active sites, IFD was again per-
formed. The expected PETase activity was again captured from a
structural standpoint, with the PEF ester oriented within nucle-
ophilic attack distance of Ser160 (Fig. 4E and F and SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S7B). As with PET IFD results, we were able
to identify interactions to supp ort increased activity of the
PETase double-mutant enzyme. In the PEF wild-type binding
mode (docking score of−9.07 kcal/mol), two aromatic interac-
tions are formed to Trp185 and Trp159 (SI Appendix,F i g .S 7B).
However, in the PEF double-mutant binding mode (docking score
of −10.07 kcal/mol), three aromatic interactions were observed:
parallel displaced to Trp185 (5.7 Å), point to face to His237 (5.1 Å),
and parallel displaced to Phe238 (5.2 Å). Additionally, Tyr87 is
within range for a potential aromatic interaction at 6.2 Å. One
interesting interaction was observed in the PEF double-mutant
binding mode: His237 flipped “up,” o u to ft h ec a t a l y t i ct r i a d ,
to play an aromatic stabilization role (replacing the wild-type
Trp159 stabilization), and, instead, His159 supported Ser160
via hydrogen bonding at 3.2 Å. This interaction between Ser160
and His159 is also observed in apo MD simulations of the
double-mutant structure. It could thus be postulated that His159
serves as an additional means for shuttling protons in the PETase
double mutant, which will be examined in a future study. As seen
with PET, docking scores predict increased binding affinity of
PEF to the double-mutant PETase (SI Appendix, Table S3), and,
structurally, we can relate this to aromatic interactions supported
by F238 and a potential alternative pathway for proton shuttling
during catalysis.
Discussion
The high-resolution structure described in the present study re-
veals the binding site architecture of the I. sakaiensis 201-F6
PETase, while the IFD results provide a mechanistic basis for
both the wild type and PETase double mutant toward the crys-
talline semiaromatic polyesters PET and PEF. Changes around
the active site result in a widening of the cleft compared with
structural representatives of three thermophilic cutinases (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3), without other major changes in the un-
derlying secondary or tertiary structure. Furthermore, we dem-
onstrated that PETase is active on PET of∼15% crystallinity;
while this observation is encouraging, it is envisaged that its
performance would need to be enhanced substantially, perhaps
via further active-site cleft engineering similar to ongoing work
on thermophilic cutinases and lipases (26, 30, 53, 54). Enzyme
scaffolds capable of PET breakdown above the glass transition
temperature (≥∼70 °C for PET) (20) will also be pursued in
future studies. Coupling with other processes such as milling or
grinding, which can increase the available surface area of the
plastic, also merits investigation toward enzymatic solutions for
PET and PEF recycling. Furthermore, in light of recent studies
that demonstrate the impressive synergistic effect of combining
multiple PET-active lipases (26, 30, 53, 54), we expect that in-
corporation of I. sakaiensis MHETase will further increase the
performance (55), and this will be pursued in future work. The
highly basic surface charge of PETase requires further in-
vestigation since it is not observed in other close structural ho-
mologs, but it is noteworthy that the MHETase partner is
predicted to be a fairly acidic protein, with a pI in the region
of 5.2.
Both the IFD results and MD simulations independently in-
dicate the PETase binding site is characterized by highly flexible,
large aromatic side chains, such as Trp185, Tyr87, and Trp159,
and Phe238 in the PETase double mutant. Binding of PET and
PEF induces conformational changes in these residues relative to
the crystal structure; thus, modeling protein flexibility in re-
sponse to PET/PEF is critical to predict catalytically relevant
binding modes. Additionally, results of these flexible docking
studies agree with experimentally observed trends in perfor-
mance in the wild type relative to the double mutant, and pro-
vide structural insight to explain this enhancement.
PETase activity on both PET and PEF, but not on aliphatic
polyesters such as PBS and PLA, provides the basis for charac-
terizing this enzyme more broadly as an aromatic polyesterase
rather than solely as a PETase. It is likely that the enhanced gas
barrier properties of PEF will lead to its adoption for beer bot-
tles, and that this recalcitrant material will thus ultimately find its
way to the environment. It is therefore encouraging that PETase
is also natively capable of PEF degradation. It is also noteworthy
that in this study, PETase was freeze-dried and shipped between
continents, and that it retained similar performance profiles after
freeze-drying, which is a positive feature for its potential use in
applications that require enzyme production and use be distinct, as
it would potentially be the case formost biobased recycling options.
The problem of plastics depolymerization by enzymes closely
mirrors that of enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides, such
as cellulose and chitin (56, 57). Indeed, strategies that have been
used to understand and improve glycoside hydrolases, including
the development of quantitative assays for measuring enzyme (or
enzyme cocktail) performance on solid substrates, likely can
serve as inspiration for more quantitative metrics for comparing
plastics-degrading enzymes and enzyme mixtures, which will be
reported in future studies. Moreover, the method of PETase
action is of keen interest for further protein and enzyme mixture
engineering studies. The direct catalytic mechanism could be
studied with mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics
MD-based approaches similar to previous work on carbohydrate-
active enzymes (58). Beyond the active site, the enzyme may
interact with and cleave the substrate in an endofashion by
cleaving PET (or PEF) chains internal to a polymer or in an
exofashion by only cleaving PET from the chain ends. Methods
employed in the cellulase and chitinase research community,
such as substrate labeling with easily detected reporter molecules
or examination of product ratios, could potentially shed light on
this question, and will be pursued in future efforts (59). Lastly, at
low substrate loadings, many pol ysaccharide-active enzymes
rely on multimodular architectures, with a carbohydrate-binding
module attached to the catalytic domain (57). For polyesterase
enzymes, hydrophobins, carb ohydrate-binding modules, and
polyhydroxyalkanoate-binding modules have been used to increase
the catalytic efficiency of cutinases for PET degradation (60, 61).
Certainly, further opportunities exist for engineering or evolving for
higher binding affinity of accessory modules to increase the overall
surface concentration of catalytic domains on the PET surface.
Given the fact that PET was only patented roughly 80 y ago
and put into widespread use in the 1970s, it is likely that the
enzyme system for PET degradation and catabolism in I.
sakaiensis appeared only recently, demonstrating the remarkable

speed at which microbes can evolve to exploit new substrates: in
this case, waste from an industrial PET recycling facility. More-
over, given the results obtained for the PETase double mutant, it
is likely that significant potential remains for improving its activity
further. This enzyme thus provides an exciting platform for addi-
tional protein engineering and evolution to increase the efficiency
and substrate range of this polyesterase, as well as to provide clues
of how to further engineer thermophilic cutinases to better in-
corporate aromatic polyesters, toward to the persistent challenge
of highly crystalline polymer degradation.
Conclusions
The discovery of a bacterium that uses PET as a major carbon and
energy source has raised significant interest in how such an enzy-
matic mechanism functions with such a highly resistant polymeric
substrate that appears to survive for centuries in the environment.
This work shows that a collection of subtle variations on the surface
of a lipase/cutinase-like fold has the ability to endow PETase with a
platform for aromatic polyester depolymerization. These findings
open up the possibility to further utilize and combine the extensive
platform of cutinase and lipase research over the past decades with
directed protein engineering and evolution to adapt this scaffold
further and tackle environmentally relevant polymer bioaccu-
mulation and biobased industrial polyester recycling.
Methods
Cloning and Protein Production.Codon optimizedEscherichia coliexpression
clones were constructed for PETase as described inSI Appendix, Fig. S2B.
Crystallization and Structure Determination. PETase was crystallized in five
conditions, and long-wavelength sulfur–single-wavelength anomalous dif-
fraction and high-resolution X-ray data collection was performed in vacuo at
beamline I23. Standard X-ray data collection was performed at beamlines
I03 and I04 at the Diamond Light Source. Detailed methods and statistics are
provided inSI Appendix, Table S1.
Substrate Docking. The PETase crystal structure, PETase double mutant, and
PET and PEF tetramers were modeled using tools from Schrödinger. Protein
preparation and ligand preparation where conducted using tools in Schrödinger,
along with IFD, to predict PET and PEF binding modes to PETase wild type and
double mutant. Additional details can be found inSI Appendix(62, 63).
Polymer Synthesis. PET and PEF were produced via the polycondensation of
EG with TPA and FDCA, respectively. Following polycondensation, the
polymers were dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid, precipitated in methanol, and
subsequently redissolved in trifluoroacetic acid for film casting. Following
casting, the coupons were annealed in a vacuum oven at 90 °C (above their
glass transition temperature). Additional details can be found inSI Appendix.
PETase Digestion of Polymer Films.Coupons sized∼6 mm in diameter of each
polymer film were placed in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube with 500μLo f5 0n M
PETase in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The digestions were carried
out at 30 °C. Analysis of the films and supernatant was done after 96 h
of digestion.
SEM. Polymer coupons sized ∼6 mm in diameter were examined by SEM,
both before and after PETase treatment for 96 h. PETase-treated samples
were rinsed with 1% SDS, followed by dH2O and then ethanol. Samples were
sputter-coated with 8 nm of iridium. Coated samples were mounted on
aluminum stubs using carbon tape, and conductive silver paint was applied
to the sides of the samples to reduce charging. SEM imaging was performed
using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG instrument under low vacuum (0.45 torr) op-
erating with a gaseous solid-state detector. Imaging was performed with a
beam-accelerating voltage of 15 keV.
