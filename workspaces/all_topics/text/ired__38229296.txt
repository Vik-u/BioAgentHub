Abstract 
Enzymatic processes play an increasing role in synthetic organic chemistry which requires the access to a broad and diverse 
set of enzymes. Metagenome mining is a valuable and efficient way to discover novel enzymes with unique properties for 
biotechnological applications. Here, we report the discovery and biocatalytic characterization of six novel metagenomic opine 
dehydrogenases from a hot spring environment (mODHs) (EC 1.5.1.X). These enzymes catalyze the asymmetric reductive 
amination between an amino acid and a keto acid resulting in opines which have defined biochemical roles and represent 
promising building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. The newly identified enzymes exhibit unique substrate specificity 
and higher thermostability compared to known examples. The feature that they preferably utilize negatively charged polar 
amino acids is so far unprecedented for opine dehydrogenases. We have identified two spatially correlated positions in their 
active sites that govern this substrate specificity and demonstrated a switch of substrate preference by site-directed mutagen-
esis. While they still suffer from a relatively narrow substrate scope, their enhanced thermostability and the orthogonality of 
their substrate preference make them a valuable addition to the toolbox of enzymes for reductive aminations. Importantly, 
enzymatic reductive aminations with highly polar amines are very rare in the literature. Thus, the preparative-scale enzy -
matic production, purification, and characterization of three highly functionalized chiral secondary amines lend a special 
significance to our work in filling this gap.

Introduction
Imine reducing enzymes produce a chiral amine often with 
excellent stereoselectivity. Therefore, there is a constant 
interest towards them in the pharmaceutical industry. This 
interest is driven by the high number of active pharmaceu-
tical ingredients (APIs) bearing a chiral amine moiety as 
illustrated among the FDA-approved small molecule drugs 
between 2015 and 2020 (Bhutani et al. 2021). Key chiral 
amine intermediates of these APIs are often produced enzy-
matically using transaminases (TAs) (Gomm and O’Reilly 
2018), amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs), imine reductases 
(IREDs), or monoamine oxidases (MAOs) (Sharma et al. 
2017; Cosgrove et al. 2018; Patil et al. 2018). These enzymes 
result in chiral primary amines (TAs, AmDHs), perform

asymmetric reduction of preformed imines (IREDs), or 
stereoselectively oxidize cyclic amines to imines (MAOs). 
Recently, a subclass of IREDs was found to catalyze reduc-
tive amination of carbonyls with small primary amines in 
close to stoichiometric ratio (Aleku et al. 2017); thus, they 
were termed reductive aminases (RedAms). The applications 
of RedAms are expanding ever since (Schober et al. 2019), 
but their substrate scope is still limited to aliphatic or smaller 
aromatic amines, while reactions with more functionalized 
polar amines are lagging behind.
Opine dehydrogenases (ODHs) represent a unique and 
yet largely underexplored class in this rapidly expanding 
landscape of biocatalysts for reductive amination (Telek 
et al. 2023 ). They catalyze the coupling of α-ketoacids 
with α-amino acids yielding a variety of opine products. 
These molecules have diverse structures and physiological 
roles, and different organisms evolved specialized ODHs 
for their synthesis (Kato and Asano 2002; Harcet et al. 
2013; McFarlane and Lamb 2020; Matveeva and Otten 
2021). Despite the large evolutionary distance and low 
apparent sequence similarity among these ODHs, they 
share general structural and catalytic features (Sharma 
et al. 2017), while their substrate and cofactor prefer -
ence can vary significantly. The fact that they are able to 
perform reductive amination with close to stoichiometric 
ketoacid/amino acid ratio makes them promising pros-
pects to be utilized as industrial biocatalysts. Considering 
that their natural substrates are chemically very different 
from the typical imine reductase or reductive aminase 
substrates, they can fill in a valuable complementary role 
next to those classes. Highly functionalized polar sec-
ondary amines (such as opine derivatives) are potential 
building blocks of bioactive compounds such as pepti-
domimetics (Li Petri et al. 2022). Their stereoselective 
synthesis by ODHs can be easily envisaged. However, this 
potential of ODHs is largely unexploited probably due to 
the significant difference between their native substrates 
and the potential target substrates (Ducrot et al. 2021) as 
well as their zwitterionic and highly polar nature. The 
only example of their utilization as biocatalysts is the 
ODH from Arthrobacter sp. 1C (ArODH), which was 
discovered by Asano et al. (1989) and used for the syn-
thesis of secondary amine dicarboxylic acids with apolar 
sidechains (Kato et al. 1996). A decade later, Codexis 
engineered this enzyme to accept substrates resembling 
the classic imine reductase substrates like cyclohexanone 
or n-butylamine. This work—that was only disclosed in 
a patent (Chen et al. 2013)—also shows that ODHs have 
to undergo significant engineering to accept substrates 
largely deviating from their natural ones. However, pro-
tein engineering towards structurally similar analogues 
with orthogonally protected or masked functional groups 
might be less exhaustive. Isolation of such derivatives 
could also be more straightforward enabling more ver -
satility for further functionalization. There are a few 
other well-characterized enzymes among ODHs such 
as the octopine dehydrogenase from Pecten maximus  
(PmOcDH) (Smits et al. 2008) or metallophore biosyn-
thetic enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus ( SaODH), 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PaODH), and Yersinia pestis  
(YpODH) (McFarlane et al. 2018). These all have differ -
ent substrate preferences; PmOcDH is specific for pyru-
vate and l-arginine, while the enzymes from pathogens 
use exotic nicotianamine-like amino acid derivatives and 
pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate. We may add that this chemi-
cal diversity has not yet been exploited fully for bioca-
talysis. In addition, there are a lot of sequences in public 
databases annotated as opine dehydrogenases, but the 
information on their activity and substrate preferences is 
lacking; therefore, the above-mentioned diversity is prob-
ably even greater. Metagenome search is a method that 
is capable of sampling a diversity while simultaneously 
selecting for advantageous properties (Robinson et al. 
2021). It involves the interrogation of the whole genetic 
information extracted from a certain environment. Today, 
we have the technology of finding genes and enzymes in 
such metagenomic samples, without identifying the—pos-
sibly unknown—host organisms (Kerepesi et al. 2014, 
2015; Kerepesi and Grolmusz 2016a, b, 2017). This 
allows access to potential biocatalysts from previously 
uncharacterized species that could exhibit altered sub-
strate specificity, increased thermotolerance or catalytic 
activity. This method was already applied to find novel 
enzymes for chiral amine synthesis such as transaminases 
(Baud et al. 2017; Leipold et al. 2019) or amine dehydro-
genases (Caparco et al. 2020). For opine dehydrogenases, 
a recent paper describes one novel metagenome-derived 
alanopine dehydrogenase (Kaličanin et al. 2023), but no 
further enzymes are reported to date.
In our study, we set out to expand the class of ODHs 
with new enzymes with useful properties for industrial bio-
catalysis. We applied metagenome mining to identify novel 
ODHs from extreme environments. The catalytic activity 
and substrate preference of the newly discovered enzymes 
were investigated under conditions relevant for biocatalytic 
applications. Their unique structural and sequential fea-
tures were thoroughly analyzed to aid future engineering of 
these enzymes towards industrial applications with specific 
substrates.

HPLC methods
Analytical HPLC measurements were performed on Agi-
lent Technologies 1260 LC system equipped with a DAD 
detector using Gemini® 3 µm NX-C18, 50 mm × 3.00 mm 
i.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous  NH4HCO3 solu-
tion and MeCN as eluents in gradient mode. Analytical 
LC–MS was performed on an Agilent Technologies 1200 
LC system equipped with Agilent 6140 quadrupole MS, 
operating in positive or negative ion electrospray ionization 
mode (molecular weight scan range was 100 to 1350 m/z) 
with parallel UV detection using Gemini® 3 µm NX-C18, 
50 mm × 3.00 mm i.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous 
 NH4HCO3 solution and MeCN as eluents in gradient mode. 
Purifications were carried out with Teledyne Isco prepara-
tive HPLC using Gemini® 5 µm NX-C18, 250 mm × 50 mm 
i.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous  NH4HCO3 solution 
and MeCN as eluents in gradient mode.
NMR measurements
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 
Avance Ultrashield 400 (100 MHz 13C) instrument with 
Bruker Prodigy Cryo Probe and were internally referenced 
to residual protium solvent signals (note:  D2O referenced at 
4.70 ppm). Samples (5–10 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 mL 
 D2O. In the case of Fmoc-2a products, 4 µL trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) was added for complete dissolution. Data for 1H 
NMR are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ  ppm), mul-
tiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of a doublet, 
t = triplet, dt = doublet of a triplet, m = multiplet), coupling 
constant (Hz), and integration. Fmoc-derivatized products 
form amide rotamers appearing as doubled signals which 
is indicated by the two δ (ppm) values separated by a slash, 
e.g., 8.38/8.31 (d/d, J  = 1.3/1.4 Hz, 1 H). Assignments of 
protons are listed on the spectra (Figure S7-S14). Data for 
13C NMR are reported in terms of chemical shift, and no 
special nomenclature is used for equivalent carbons.
High resolution mass spectrometry
HRMS measurements were carried out on an Agilent 6545 
Q-TOF mass spectrometer system: mass resolution, 45.000 
FWHM @ m/z 2.722 Da; ion source, AJS-ESI; sheath gas 
temperature, 300 °C; drying gas temperature, 300 °C; ion-
izing voltage, 2500 V; and nozzle voltage, 1000 V.
Metagenome search
The method is based on an artificial intelligence tool, the 
hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Yoon 2009), described in 
detail by Szalkai and Grolmusz (2019), and is demonstrated 
on our webserver for smaller metagenomes (< 1 GB) at the 
address https:// metah mm. pitgr oup. org.
First, we trained our metagenome search tool on ten dif-
ferent, already described opine dehydrogenase sequences 
(listed in Table S1). From these sequences, using multi-
ple alignment with Clustal Omega software as a middle 
step (Sievers et al. 2011), a hidden Markov model was 
built with the hmmbuild tool (Eddy 2009). Applying the 
Markov model, we selected tens of thousands of short reads 
from the target metagenomes applying the hmmsearch 
tool (Eddy 2009 ). The target metagenomes were down -
loaded from the NCBI Short Read Archive, with accession 
numbers SRR2915707 (deep-sea sediment metagenome), 
SRR16646004 (tropical soil metagenome), SRR16606022 
(hot spring metagenome, Sativali), and SRR16588181 (hot 
spring metagenome, Tuwa). The hits from the metagen-
omes were assembled into the longest possible sequences 
by the MegaHIT assembler (Li et al. 2015), and from these 
sequences, we selected potential complete genes with start 
and end codons (Table  S2). Nucleotide sequence data 
reported are available in the Third Party Annotation (TPA) 
Section of the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank databases under the 
accession numbers TPA: BK063522-BK063532.
Sequence analysis and structural modelling 
of mODHs
Sequence similarity network (SSN) of the new mODHs and 
the template ODHs was created using the Enzyme Similar -
ity Tool (EFI-EST, https:// efi. igb. illin ois. edu/ efi- est/) (Zallot 
et al. 2019). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic 
trees were generated using Clustal Omega (https:// www. ebi. 
ac. uk/ Tools/ msa/ clust alo/). Structural modelling of mODHs 
was carried out by open source AlphaFold prediction algo-
rithm accessed through ColabFold (Mirdita et al. 2022). 
Structures were visualized and analyzed in PyMOL. Elec-
trostatic surface potential calculations were performed using 
the APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver, https://  
www. poiss onbol tzmann. org/) plugin in PyMOL (https://  
www. pymol. org/ pymol). Analysis of binding pockets was 
aided by Caver Web v1.2 (https:// losch midt. chemi. muni. cz/ 
caver web/) (Stourac et al. 2019).
Enzyme production and purification
Nine selected mODH genes as well as the coding sequence 
of ArODH were codon optimized for E. coli, synthesized by 
Genescript and cloned into pET14b vector using NdeI and 
BamHI cloning sites resulting in N-terminal His-tag proteins 
(for protein and nucleotide sequences see Table S2). Plas-
mids were transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) chemically 
competent cells, and 5 mL overnight cultures were grown

in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with carbeni-
cillin. Then, 4 mL was added to 500 mL fresh LB medium. 
The culture was grown at 37 °C to OD = 0.5 and induced by 
addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. The flasks were then incubated 
in a shaker at 18 °C overnight. The cells were harvested 
by centrifugation at 4000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min. The pel-
lets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH = 8.5, 
300 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phos-
phine (TCEP), DNase) and lysed by ultrasonication. The 
suspension was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min. 
The supernatant was loaded onto equilibrated Ni–NTA col-
umn and washed with 15 mM imidazole in lysis buffer. The 
bound protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in lysis 
buffer and then dialyzed in 50 mM Tris pH = 8.5. The result-
ing solution was aliquoted after addition of 10% glycerol and 
then stored at − 20 °C until further use. Total protein concen-
tration was determined based on absorption at 280 nm meas-
ured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. With this method, 
six mODHs and ArODH could be purified (see Table S2). 
Three mODHs were not expressed in soluble form in this 
experimental setting.
Site‑directed mutagenesis
Mutagenesis experiments were conducted according to the 
Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit Quick Protocol pro -
vided by the manufacturer (Table S6). KLD reactions were 
transformed into XL1Blue chemically competent cells and 
were plated on LB-TC/CAR agarose plates. Single colonies 
were picked and used to inoculate 5 mL overnight cultures. 
From these, plasmids were purified according to the Nucle-
oSpin Plasmid Prep protocol. The purified plasmids were 
sent to sequencing to verify mutations and then used for 
protein expression.
Differential scanning fluorimetry (Thermofluor) 
measurements
To 1 mg/mL solutions of enzymes (mODHs, ArODH) was 
added 1000 × SYPRO Orange dye. Twenty-five-microliter 
samples were loaded onto 96-well plates in triplicates. Fluo-
rescent signal versus temperature was in a CFX96 real-time 
PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with a gradient from 25 to 
95 °C (0.5 °C steps).
Kinetic measurements
Enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically at 
30 °C in 96-well half-area plates in a Thermo Scientific™ 
Multiskan SkyHigh Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Standard assays 
were carried out by using 15 mM amino acid and 0.2 mM 
NAD(P)H in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 8.0). 
The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mM pyruvate. 
The decrease in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. Initial 
velocities (v0) were calculated from the linear section of the 
plots using an NAD(P)H calibration. For the determination 
of kinetic constants, amino acid concentrations were var -
ied between 1 and 30 mM, while cofactor concentrations 
were between 0.04 and 0.5 mM. Depending on the specific 
activities of each enzyme, enzyme concentrations were 
fixed between 0.015 and 1.5 µM (Tables S9-S12). Kinetic 
constants were determined from the Michaelis–Menten 
plots using GraphPad Prism software (Tables S9-S12, Fig-
ures S15-S18). Heat stability experiments were carried out 
by incubating the enzymes at 40, 50, or 60 °C for 1 h before 
measuring their specific activities.
Small scale biocatalytic reactions, parameter opti‑
mizations
For preliminary activity measurements and reaction optimi-
zation, the reaction mixtures (500 µL) contained 62.5 mM 
d-glucose, 6 U/mL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), 
0.4 mM  NAD+/NADP+, 25 mM amino acid substrate, and 
5 equivalents of sodium pyruvate substrate in Na-phosphate 
buffer adjusted to pH 7.5 in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. To 
the blank mix was added 30 µg purified enzyme (mODHs, 
ArODH). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C 
with shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h. Parameters were opti-
mized on the following ranges: pH 6.0–8.0, temperature 
30–50 °C, pyruvate equivalence 1.5–5.0, and enzyme load-
ing 7.5–60 µg/mL. To follow the reactions, 100-µL sam-
ples were taken and derivatized based on the protocol from 
Tassano et al. (2022). Samples were diluted 1:1 with Na-
borate buffer (300 mM, pH 9.2), then 200 µL of a solution 
of Fmoc-Cl (15 mM in ACN) was added, and the samples 
were shaken for 10 min, 30 °C, and at 1000 rpm. Next, 200 
µL solution of amantadine hydrochloride (300 mM in 1:1 
 H2O/ACN) was added. The formed white precipitate was 
centrifuged 5 min/1500 rpm, and the supernatant was ana-
lyzed. Analysis was done on HPLC–MS. The conversion 
was calculated by measuring the depletion of the amino acid 
as follows: HPLC area of the Fmoc-amino acid peak in the 
enzymatic reaction was compared to that of blank reactions 
carried out under identical conditions without ODH present.
Substrate screening
On a 1-mL 96-deep-well plate, 500 µL reactions were carried 
out. The reaction mixtures contained 62.5 mM d-glucose, 6 U/
mL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), 0.4 mM  NADP+ (or 
 NAD+ for ArODH), 25 mM amino acid substrate, and 75 mM 
of ketoacid substrate in Na-phosphate buffer adjusted to 
pH = 8.0. To the blank mix was added 15 µg purified enzyme

(six mODHs, ArODH). The reaction mixtures were incubated 
at 40 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h. Reactions were 
performed in triplicates. Sample preparation and calculation 
of conversion were done as described in the previous section, 
and analysis was carried out on HPLC.
Preparative scale reactions and purifications
30 mL reaction mixture contained 62.5 mM d-glucose, 6 U/
mL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), 0.4 mM  NADP+, and 
25 mM amino acid substrate with 3 equivalents of sodium pyru-
vate in Na-phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 8.0. To the blank 
mix was added 900 µg purified enzyme (ArODH or mODH-
582). The reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 24 h. After 
24 h, the reaction was boiled for 15 min, and then, the precipitate 
was filtered out. To the filtrate was added 8 equivalents Fmoc-Cl 
in 60 mL ACN, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 16 h. 
Afterwards, the pH was adjusted to 7.5, and the mixture was 
extracted twice with EtOAc. The aqueous phase was concen-
trated and purified by preparative HPLC.

In a 100-mL round-bottom flask, methanol (40 mL) was 
added to l-histidine (2 mmol, 310.3 mg) and Na-acetate 
(4 mmol, 328.1 mg) followed by pyruvic acid (4 mmol, 
278.0 µL). Then,  NaCNBH3 (4 mmol, 4 mL of 1 M solution

at RT for 20 h. After histidine appeared absent on LC–MS, 
9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (Fmoc-Cl) (4  mmol, 
1.03 g) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C. 
After 3 h, another batch of Fmoc-Cl (2 mmol, 515 mg) was 
added, and stirring was continued for 4 h at 60 °C and then 
for 4 days at RT. MeOH was removed under reduced pres-
sure. The residue was partially dissolved in 1 M HCl (8 mL) 
and extracted with 15 mL EtOAc. Both phases contained 
the product diastereomers. The aqueous phase was purified 
on preparative HPLC. The organic phase was evaporated to 
dryness. The residue was dissolved in acetonitrile (8 mL)

Results
Metagenome mining of ODHs
We started with building a database containing ODH 
sequences that can be used as templates for metagenome 
search. We mined the literature for enzymes with known pri-
mary structure and confirmed activity to avoid falsely anno-
tated sequences. In the end, we have collected 11 sequences 
from a diverse set of organisms and with wide substrate and 
cofactor preferences (see Fig.  1 and Table S1). These were 
used to construct a multiple sequence alignment to train 
a hidden Markov model (HMM), as described in a recent 
publication (Szalkai and Grolmusz 2019). In order to find 
enzymes with preferable properties for industrial biocataly-
sis, we selected datasets from NCBI Short Read Archive 
collected from extreme environments (see “Materials and 
Methods”). The trained HMM was used to extract full-
length sequences resembling the general features of ODHs. 
From the four different datasets (see “Materials and Meth-
ods”), only one, the Sativali hot spring (67 °C) (Narsing 
Rao et al. 2022), metagenome provided new putative ODH 
genes. From that dataset, 11 sequences were obtained that 
showed remarkably low sequence identity (< 40%) with all 
template sequences used while displaying higher degree 
of similarity among each other (Fig.  1A and B). Interest -
ingly, although the HMM included characteristics from all 
the 11 diverse ODHs, still, for all of the finally identified 
mODHs, the closest homologue in the template set is the 
ODH from Arthrobacter sp. 1C (ArODH). Since ArODH 
is the only known example of an ODH used in biocatalysis, 
we decided to use it as a reference enzyme for the charac-
terization of the metagenomic ODHs (mODHs) as potential 
new biocatalysts. From the 11 sequences, we have discarded 
two due to the lack of a consensus sequence required for 
cofactor binding at the front of these genes (see Table S2). 
Thus, we have ordered ten synthetic genes (nine mODHs 
and ArODH), cloned into pET14b vector, expressed them in 
E. coli and purified them. Three metagenomic enzymes did 
not exhibit soluble expression in our system, so in the end, 
six mODHs and ArODH were obtained with yields between 
10 and 70 mg/L culture. Those metagenomic enzymes have 
close to 40% sequence identity to ArODH but have varying 
degree of similarity (~ 45–80%) among each other (Fig. 1C).
Substrate screen for mODHs
As the main aim of our study was to explore and exploit 
the synthetic utility of the newly discovered enzymes, we 
have tested their activity in small scale biocatalytic reactions 
(Scheme 1), where their activity is measured by the apparent 
conversion to the product. The reactions were followed by 
HPLC with UV and MS detection. Since most of the used 
substrates had poor retention on normal phase and weak UV 
signal, we have applied a derivatization method (Tassano 
et al. 2022) to follow the consumption of the amino acid 
substrate (see “Materials and Methods”). The presence of 
the product could be confirmed based on its MS signal. Pre-
liminary experiments showed that mODHs have negligible 
activity with the best amino acid substrates of ArODH, like 
l-norvaline or l-phenylalanine and only few percent con-
version with l-alanine when using NADH, the usual cofac-
tor for ArODH. In the latter case, the observable product 
formation prompted us to test NADPH instead of NADH 
as cofactor, which yielded enhanced conversions (data not 
shown). Therefore, NADPH was used for the optimization 
of reaction conditions and substrate screening. Next, after 
screening a restricted set of natural amino acids including 
apolar (alanine, leucine, valine, methinonine), polar (ser -
ine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine), and charged ones 
(aspartate, glutamate), we have identified l-aspartate (3) to 
be a preferred substrate for mODHs. Pyruvate (a ) is often 
the only ketoacid substrate of ODHs; therefore, we did not 
consider changing that substrate at this stage. We used the

l-aspartate (3 ) and pyruvate (a ) substrate combination to 
optimize reaction conditions for extensive substrate screen-
ing using two selected best performing enzymes (mODH-45 
and mODH-49). The optimum conditions are different from 
the ones normally used for ArODH with higher temperature 
(30 vs. 40 °C) and slightly higher pH (7.5 vs. 8.0) (Kato 
et al. 1996) (Scheme 1).
Using these conditions, we set out to investigate the activ-
ity of mODHs on a diverse set of amino acid and ketoacid 
substrates. Amino acids included 13 canonical (1–4, 13–21) 
and 13 non-canonical amino acids (5–12, 22–26), while on 
the ketoacid side, only natural substrates were tested (see 
Tables S3 and S4). The screening results show that in con-
trast to ArODH’s preference for apolar amino acid substrates, 
mODHs exhibit the highest conversions with polar amino 
acids, mostly with negatively charged sidechains (Fig.  2). 
l-Aspartate (3) and l-glutamate (4) clearly stand out among 
the natural amino acids with four of six mODHs exhibiting 
100% conversion with the former and above 50% with the 
latter. Exchanging the carboxylate with a sulfonate group 
(l-cysteic acid (7) or homocysteic acid (9)) results in similar 
or even better substrates for mODHs. Notably, phosphoryl-
ated amino acids (5, 6) are converted significantly less effi-
ciently, even though mODHs are still superior to ArODH in 
these reactions. Aromatic side chains are generally not well 
tolerated by mODHs; however, l-histidine (2) is transformed 
with conversions comparable to ArODH, while mODH-48 
is also capable of transforming 4-carboxy- l-phenylalanine 
(8) with moderate conversion. Opine dehydrogenases have 
strong enantiomer specificity towards l-amino acids (Telek 
et al. 2023). mODHs share this feature as we could dem-
onstrate by comparing conversions with d- and l-aspartate 
(data not shown). This strong specificity can explain the 
moderate conversions with racemic amino acids (homocyst-
eic acid (9), 2-aminopimelic acid (10), homoserine (11)) that 
otherwise proved to be good substrates of mODHs. Among 
ketoacids, pyruvate (a ) is clearly preferred above all oth-
ers. α-Ketobutyrate (c ) is accepted to some extent, while 
conversions with glyoxylate (b) and α-ketoglutarate (d) are 
negligible (except for mODH-47).
Kinetic characterization of mODHs
After testing the mODHs in small-scale biocatalytic reac-
tions, we wanted to gain insight into their kinetic properties 
that govern the above-described apparent catalytic activi-
ties. We have performed Michaelis–Menten kinetic studies 
to assess the amino acid substrate kinetics and determined 
kinetic constants for NADH/NADPH (Table 1). The mODHs 
show similar characteristics in their turnover numbers (kcat); 
the differences between their catalytic efficiencies can be

data for all substrates, see SI.) A Canonical amino acid substrates 
(pyruvate is fixed as ketoacid substrate). B Enantiopure non-canon-
ical amino acid substrates (pyruvate is fixed as ketoacid substrate). 
C Racemic non-natural amino acid substrates (pyruvate is fixed as 
ketoacid substrate). Since these substrates were used as racemates, 
the maximal conversion is expected to be 50% assuming full enan-
tiomer selectivity towards l-amino acids. D Ketoacid substrates 
(l-aspartate is fixed as amino acid substrate). Conversions were 
calculated as depletion of the amino acid substrate in a small scale 
biocatalytic reaction. Each reaction was measured in triplicates, and 
error bars represent the standard deviation calculated (see Tables S3 
and S4)

attributed to their K M values which can deviate more than 
an order of magnitude from each other. The cofactor kinet-
ics corroborate our assumption of NADPH preference for 
most of mODHs with the exception of mODH-48 which 
shows similar catalytic efficiency with NADH and mODH-
582 which appears to prefer NADH. In the latter case, the 
catalytic efficiency with NADPH is still comparable to the 
other mODHs.
Heat stability of mODHs
The mODH sequences have been identified from the 
metagenomic data that were collected for microbial commu-
nities living under extreme conditions such as in hot springs. 
It was therefore of interest to decide if their protein stability 
may reflect adaptation to the extreme conditions. We applied 
differential scanning fluorimetry (Niesen et al. 2007; Gao 
et al. 2020) to determine the melting point of these mODH 
proteins. As also shown in Table 2, all mODHs that we puri-
fied showed drastic increase (15–30 °C) in thermal stabil-
ity as compared to the model ArODH (see also Figure S2 
for raw melting curve data). This result is encouraging for 
enzyme stability under chemical process conditions.
In addition, we have performed heat stability experiments 
by incubating the enzymes at varying temperatures before 
measuring their specific activities. From the residual activi-
ties, it is clear that while ArODH loses activity at 50 °C, the 
metagenomic enzymes show moderate or no loss of activity 
even at 60 °C (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the metagen-
omic enzymes derived from a hot spring have not only 
higher melting temperatures (see above) but they can also 
retain their activity after exposure to higher temperatures.
Molecular determinants of substrate preference
In order to better understand the factors determining the dif-
ferent amino acid substrate preferences of ODHs, we per -
formed detailed analysis of their sequences and structures. 
For the latter structures, models predicted by AlphaFold 
were used. The overall structure of mODHs resembles well 
other opine dehydrogenases even with very low sequence 
identity (Fig.  4). The structural family of enzymes sharing 
this overall fold is named octopine dehydrogenases (Pfam 
02317) after the first and most well-characterized enzyme 
from Pecten maximus ( PmOcDH) (Smits et al. 2008) and 
octopine synthases (OCS) from naturally transgenic plants 
(Hack and Kemp 1980; Matveeva and Otten 2021). ArODH 
is also part of this structural class as outlined by several 
publications (Britton et al. 1998; Smits et al. 2008; Sharma 
et al. 2017). A general feature of this class is the two-domain 
structure, an NAD(P)H-binding domain at the N-terminus 
and a substrate binding domain at the C-terminus. The two 
domains form a cleft together, wherein catalysis can take

place upon closure of the cleft by domain motions (Fig. 4A). 
On the first domain, a key structural motif is the Rossmann-
fold helix (GxGxxG/A) responsible for cofactor binding, 
widely shared among NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenases. 
The substrate binding domain contains a few residues that 
are conserved among ODHs from any organism, such as a 
catalytic histidine-aspartate dyad or a key tryptophan residue 
in the active site (Fig.  4B). Based on these similarities, it 
can be assumed that findings describing the general mode 
of action of ODHs (Smits et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2017; 
McFarlane et al. 2018) are applicable to the new mODHs 
as well.
However, the factors determining substrate specific-
ity were still unclear, so we set out to investigate that by 
bioinformatic as well as experimental means. Compar -
ing active site residues corresponding to those mutated 
by Codexis (see Table S5), mostly only subtle differences 
appear between ArODH and mODHs. A notable exception 
is the position 111 in ArODH, where an alanine is replaced 
by an arginine in all mODHs. We hypothesized that this 
change can be responsible for the substrate preference of 
mODHs towards amino acids with negatively charged side 
chains. Therefore, we performed mutagenesis on mODH-
582 to have the variant R110A. We also created a “control 
mutant” ArODH A111R. Testing the activity of these vari-
ants on l-aspartate and l-phenylalanine and comparing them 
to the wild-type enzymes revealed loss of activity with the 
original substrates, but no gain of activity towards the other 
(Table S7). This result prompted us to further inspect the 
active site of ODHs, and we realized that the position 198 
might be spatially correlated with the position 111. ArODH 
has an asparagine opposite to A111 while all mODHs pos-
sess glycine in that position leaving more space to the longer 
arginine side chain. Therefore, we prepared double mutant 
variants mODH-582 R110A G198N and ArODH A111R 
N198G. We tested these variants with l-aspartate and l-phe-
nylalanine and observed a complete switch of substrate pref-
erence (Fig. 4C). We carried out the kinetic characterization 
of these variants and compared the results to the wild-type 
enzymes (Table 3). Here, we observed no apparent reaction 
with the non-preferred substrates; thus, the change in sub-
strate preference could be clearly demonstrated.
In addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, we 
decided to also take a holistic approach towards rational-
izing the substrate preference of ODHs. We performed 
APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) calculations 
to assess the electrostatic surface potential of mODHs. In 
accordance with our experimental results showing a pref-
erence of mODHs for negatively charged substrates, all 
mODHs show a remarkable accumulation of positive sur -
face charge inside their active sites in strong contrast to the 
close to neutral surface potential of the ArODH active site 
(Fig. 5B and C, Figure S3). To follow up on this result, we 
wanted to identify specific residues that could be respon-
sible for this charge accumulation inside the cleft between

the two domains. To this end, we identified the residues 
lining the walls of this cleft using the Caver Web tool 
of Loschmidt Laboratories (Stourac et al. 2019). Then, 
we reduced a multiple sequence alignment of ArODH and 
mODHs to only contain these residues (Fig.  5A). Inter -
estingly, we could not identify large differences in terms 
of charged residues. The only position, which contains a 
neutral to positive change for all mODHs, is the above-
mentioned position 111 of ArODH. There are several other 
positions, however, that show positive charge changes (i.e., 
negative to neutral or neutral to positive), but not for all 
mODHs: 14 (N to H), 34 (D to N/S), 36 (D to T/S/F), 108

Preparative scale transformations and diastereose‑
lectivity
After establishing the substrate preference of the 
newly discovered mODHs, we wanted to assess the 
diastereoselectivity of these enzymes and demonstrate 
their applicability in preparative scale biocatalysis. 
First, 100 mg scale transformations were conducted on

ArODH as this amino acid was accepted by both enzymes 
to a similar extent. The reactions were run until complete 
amino acid depletion was observed followed by our Fmoc-

on reverse-phase HPLC and gives low UV signal. Our 
attempts to use ion-exchange chromatography for product

isolation failed, and derivatization was still necessary, but 
the opine-type secondary amines do not react with Fmoc-
Cl under the conditions used for derivatization. Therefore, 
we scaled up and modified the protocol to yield better 
conversion to the Fmoc derivative of 2a (Fmoc-2a). This 
compound was isolated from both reactions with yields 
40% for ArODH and 20% for mODH. Meanwhile, we have 
also prepared reference compounds (Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-2a* 
and Fmoc-(1S ,2S)-2a) by chemical reductive amination of 
pyruvate (a) with l-histidine (2) (see “Materials and Meth-
ods”). The resulting diastereomers were isolated, and their 
NMR spectra were compared with the enzymatic prod -
ucts (Figure S4). Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-2a* and Fmoc-(1S ,2S)-2a 
give distinguishable signals, and the enzymatic products 
clearly correspond to Fmoc-(1 R,2S)-2a *. In addition, 
comparison of the retention times of Fmoc- 2a products 
of chemical and enzymatic origin also supports identical 
selectivity of ArODH and mODH-582 (Figure S5). Since 
the R-selectivity of ArODH is already well established 
(Asano et al. 1989), we concluded that mODH-582 has 
also R-stereoselectivity in the reductive amination. The 
diastereoselectivity of the rest of the mODHs was found 
identical to mODH-582 and ArODH by performing ana-
lytical scale reactions with l-histidine ( 2) and compar -
ing the LC chromatograms after Fmoc-derivatization 
(Figure S6). We have also carried out preparative scale 
transformations with mODH-582 using the best substrates 
of mODHs, l-aspartate (3 ), and l-cysteic acid (4 ) with 
pyruvate (a ) as ketoacid partner. The enzymatic reactions 
reached > 99% conversion, and the products were isolated 
as their Fmoc derivatives (24% for Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-3a, 23% 
for Fmoc-(1R ,2R)-7a, Scheme  2). Here, the configuration 
of the new stereocenter is assumed to be R based on the 
diastereoselectivity observed with l-histidine.
While scaling up the reactions with the preferred sub-
strates, we have revisited the question of cofactor prefer -
ence, which was only determined before in preliminary 
experiments with l-alanine and later corroborated by kinetic 
measurements (see above), but not in biocatalytic reactions. 
To our surprise, with  l-aspartate, some enzymes (mODH-
48, mODH-49, mODH-55, and mODH-582) have exhibited 
better conversions using NADH as cofactor (see Table S8). 
This result shows that the better kinetic parameters not nec-
essarily translate into higher conversion values under biocat-
alytic reaction conditions. It also suggests that the cofactor 
preference of some mODHs might be substrate dependent.
Discussion
Opine dehydrogenases are a diverse class of enzymes spe-
cialized to perform wide ranging physiological roles in 
organisms across the tree of life. Substrate specificities of 
each enzyme have evolved to perform a certain physiological 
function in the given organism. Mining opine dehydroge-
nases from metagenomes of extreme environments allows 
for identification of new enzymes with altered substrate 
specificities that could evolve under significantly different 
evolutionary pressure. In fact, the metagenomic opine dehy-
drogenases (mODHs) discovered within the framework of 
this study appear to be from an evolutionarily distant sub-
class of ODHs (Fig.  1) that was previously not described. 
Sequence identity to closest homologues deposited in Uni-
ProtKB varies between 62 and 99%, and all of them are 
unreviewed, while mODH-48 is identical to an obsolete 
entry in UniParc (Table S2). Their overall structure—as 
predicted by AlphaFold—resembles well other opine dehy-
drogenases even with very low sequence identity. However, 
they exhibit unique properties that make them a valuable 
addition to this underexplored enzyme class. Being derived 
from a hot spring metagenome, they show increased ther -
motolerance which is indicated by higher melting tempera-
tures, resistance to heat inactivation, and increased optimum 
temperature. Moreover, their substrate preference towards

negatively charged amino acid substrates is so far unprec-
edented for ODHs. The molecular background of the differ-
ent amino acid substrate specificities of ODHs has not yet 
been elucidated to date. Several residues have been proposed 
to form key interactions in the active site with the amino 
acid substrate (Smits et al. 2008; McFarlane et al. 2018), but 
there was no indication that the amino acid preference would 
be tuneable by manipulating any of these residues. In this 
study, we demonstrated the switch of the amino acid prefer-
ence in two investigated ODHs by mutating two spatially 
correlated positions. In addition to these two residues that 
directly influence substrate specificity, we have also consid-
ered global factors that can contribute to the preference of 
mODHs towards negatively charged amino acids. We have 
found that there is a significant accumulation of positive 
surface charge in the mODHs active site compared to the 
neutral surface of ArODH as revealed by APBS electrostatic 
potential calculations.
We have thoroughly analyzed the positions that can be 
responsible for this phenomenon and found that these posi-
tions are located mostly at the edges of the catalytic cleft 
rather than inside, where the catalysis takes place and nega-
tive charge changes can also be pinpointed. Overall, we can 
hypothesize that the preference of mODHs towards nega-
tively charged substrates is aided by this positively charged 
microenvironment inside the catalytic pocket. The fact that 
substitutions generating this charged microenvironment are 
not identical for all mODHs suggests that they might have 
evolved independently from a common ancestor to perform 
the same or similar functions.
The newly discovered opine dehydrogenases have a clear 
preference for l-amino acids in line with previous obser -
vations (Telek et al. 2023). The diastereoselectivity (dic-
tated by the stereoselectivity in the formation of the new 
stereocenter) also follows the general trend of ODHs, i.e., 
R-selectivity can be assumed in the reductive amination step 
based on experimental results with l-histidine.
The kinetic parameters of mODHs also align well 
with previous reports (Telek et al. 2023) even though 
their catalytic efficiency compared to ArODH (which is 
at the higher end of the reported values) was found to be 
lower (Table  1 and 3 ). This might be an adverse effect 
of their increased stability which can compromise flex-
ibility reflected in lower k cat values. The latter parameter 
could be targeted by enzyme engineering which would 
allow the exploitation of their superior thermal stabil-
ity and distant substrate preference. However, it is worth 
mentioning that the better catalytic efficiency observed in 
kinetic measurements does not necessarily translate into 
higher conversions in biocatalytic reactions. One example 
is mODH-55 which shows superior kinetic parameters to 
most of other mODHs but fails to reach > 95% conversion 
with  l-aspartate like others (Fig.  2 and Table  2). These 
discrepancies between kinetic measurements and biocata -
lytic reactions might be attributed to several factors (e.g., 
long-term enzyme stability and product inhibition) that 
can influence an enzyme’s stability in an overnight reac-
tion in contrast to a quick kinetic measurement. These 
factors might also have an effect on the cofactor prefer -
ence of these enzymes that is somewhat contradictory. In 
biocatalytic reactions with l-alanine, NADPH has proved 
to be preferred, and this preliminary observation was 
also corroborated by kinetic data measured with the best 
substrate l-aspartate (Table  2). A notable exception was 
mODH-582 that showed clear NADH preference while 
mODH-48 appeared to have no preference. However, in 
biocatalytic reactions, four of six enzymes performed bet-
ter with NADH (see Table S8). The cofactor preferences 
revealed by the kinetic data can be explained by examin-
ing the cofactor binding site of the enzymes. Position 35 
(ArODH numbering) has already been proposed to deter -
mine cofactor preference of ODHs in pathogenic bacteria 
(Laffont et al. 2019), where an arginine in that position 
ensures preferential binding of NADPH. In ArODH and 
mODH-582 that show clear NADH preference, aliphatic 
amino acids can be found in this position (alanine and 
isoleucine, respectively), while all other mODHs possess 
an arginine there (Fig.  6). This suggests that an arginine 
in position 35 is a good indicator that NADPH is accepted 
as a cofactor for the enzyme even if a clear preference 
towards it is not always observed. However, since these 
predictions are not necessarily translatable to behaviors 
in biocatalytic reactions (especially with different sub-
strates), for further experiments on these enzymes, we

tion indicates NADPH preference

suggest that cofactor preference should be established 
for each enzyme using the particular conditions and sub-
strates for any future development.
In conclusion, with the discovery of metagenomic 
opine dehydrogenases (mODHs), we were able to add a 
new subclass to the opine dehydrogenase family with so 
far unprecedented substrate specificity. The newly iden-
tified enzymes have a strong preference for polar amino 
acids, especially those with negatively charged side chain. 
This preference is governed by two spatially correlated 
positions that can be used to switch substrate specificity 
of ODHs by site-directed mutagenesis. The preference 
towards negatively charged amino acids can be further 
rationalized by an overall positively charged surface area 
within the active site. Importantly, the six mODHs dis-
play higher melting temperature and better resistance to 
heat inactivation compared to the so far best characterized 
enzyme (ArODH) which is a promising property from 
an industrial perspective. Their enantio- and diastereose-
lectivity are proposed to be identical to known ODHs 
(preference for l-amino acids and R-selectivity on the 
newly form C-N bond). Overall, these enzymes offer good 
starting points for biocatalytic applications aiming at the 
synthesis of highly functionalized peptidomimetic build-
ing blocks.
