ABSTRACT: The lack of label-free high-throughput screening technolo-
gies presents a major bottleneck in the identiﬁcation of active and selective
biocatalysts, with the number of variants often exceeding the capacity of
traditional analytical platforms to assess their activity in a practical time
scale. Here, we show the application of direct infusion of biotransformations
to the mass spectrometer (DiBT-MS) screening to a variety of enzymes, in
diﬀerent formats, achieving sample throughputs equivalent to∼40 s per
sample. The heat map output allows rapid selection of active enzymes
within 96-well plates facilitating identi ﬁcation of industrially relevant
biocatalysts. This DiBT-MS screening workﬂow has been applied to the
directed evolution of a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) as a case study,
enhancing its activity toward electron-rich cinnamic acid derivatives which
are relevant to lignocellulosic biomass degradation. Additional beneﬁts of the screening platform include the discovery of biocatalysts
(kinases, imine reductases) with novel activities and the incorporation of ion mobility technology for the identiﬁcation of product
hits with increased conﬁdence.

■ INTRODUCTION
Biocatalysis provides an alternative and increasingly attractive
sustainable pathway for the production of high-value chemical
building blocks and intermediates. However, the application of
biocatalysts in chemical synthesis is limited when using
naturally occurring enzymes because of narrow substrate
tolerance, low activity, and poor operational stability. During
the past 10 years, advances in protein engineering and directed
evolution have demonstrated that many of these important
parameters can be altered to position many more biocatalysts
for preparative organic synthesis. Despite the increasing use of
directed evolution for improving biocatalyst performance, a
major bottleneck remains in the laborious processes required
for screening libraries of variant enzymes to identify candidates
with improved properties.
1 The majority ofin vitrotechniques
that are available for analyzing enzyme libraries deploy
chromatographic methods which provide high-quality data
regarding chemical identity but are not suitable for libraries in
excess of 10
4 enzyme variants.
Applying desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS to
crude reaction mixtures permits the analysis of productsin situ2
(Figure 1 ), which has signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts for monitoring
biocatalytic reactions compared to more traditional chromato-
graphic MS methods. This approach shortens the analysis time
and removes the need for much of the solvent. Further, the
ability to correlate the spatial positions of spotted reactions and
colonies with products provides a visual reference on the
identiﬁed enzyme “hits”, followed by DNA extraction/PCR
ampliﬁcation to determine the sequence.
3 Coupling the direct
infusion of biotransformations to the mass spectrometer
(DiBT-MS) high throughput screening method, which
provides semiquantitative chemical information, to a protein
engineering strategy accelerates the evolution of enzymes as
demonstrated here.

Kinase Screening (Puriﬁed Enzymes)
Selective phosphorylation of monosaccharides, mediated by
sugar kinases, is an important reaction to access natural and

GalKs,4 and N-acetylhexosamine kinases, NahKs5) are eﬃcient
enzymes for the conversion of their natural substrates but
tolerate only limited modiﬁcations to the structure of the sugar
although homologues can often display a considerably diﬀerent
substrate spectrum.
6,7 These kinases therefore present
attractive targets for rapid screening of various substrate/
enzyme combinations to identify successful phosphorylation
reactions.
A panel of 11 diﬀerent wild-type kinases (5 GalKs and 6
NahKs) were tested against 15 variously substituted deoxy-
ﬂuorinated monosaccharides (1a−1o, Figure S2), in order to
compare our DiBT-MS screening protocol against a previously
reported
19F-NMR method to determine reaction conver-
sions.8 The output from this screen (Figure 2a) is an m/z
selected heat map of the location of the product ion of interest.
Each reaction mixture is deposited in a grid format (Figure S1)
which provides mass-resolved heat maps allowing easy visual
identiﬁcation of enzyme −substrate pairs with high activity
(brightest colored pixels). Due to the isomeric nature of some
of the substrates tested in this screen, extracting mass spectral
data for a single m/z value (M-1) (2a−2h, Table S1, 261.1
Da) is suﬃcient to view results from 88 reactions (yellow
pixels). Alternatively, if substrates (and consequently products)
are diﬀerent in mass (1i−1o, Table S1), multiple m/z values
may be selected, and the resulting heat maps can be overlaid to
generate a single, easy to interpret, image (red, green, and blue
pixels). When we compared DiBT-MS heat maps with the
results of quantitative
19F-NMR analysis (Table S2), we found
a semiquantitative correspondence between the two methods
(Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4 ,w i t ht h e
calculated reaction conversions (%) indicated below the
corresponding DiBT-MS spot).
The technique is also amenable to other enzyme classes
(Figure 2b,c) with results discussed below. Optimization of the
DiBT-MS method gives a screen of superior throughput
compared to other analytical techniques (Figure 2d). Further
investigation into quanti ﬁcation gave a good linearity of
response over 1.5 orders of magnitude and sensitivity down to
5 μM( Figure 3a,b). These limits are in part determined by the
stage raster speed and pixel size: higher throughput will
decrease analyte sensitivity (Figure 3b). The linearity aﬀorded
from summing pixel signal intensities across a sample
deposition region gave a high R
2 value of 0.9983 (obtained
across a range from 5 to 100μM, Figure 3a), with saturation
occurring for this compound (galactose-1-phosphate) above
∼1m M( Figure S5).
Screening of Metagenomic Imine Reductases (Cell-Free
Extract)
Among the toolbox of enzymes available for the generation of
chiral amines, NADPH-dependent imine reductases (IREDs)
have emerged as practical and versatile biocatalysts for both
asymmetric imine reduction and reductive amination.
9,10
Access to these biocatalysts has recently been enhanced by
exploring metagenomic sequence space to construct the largest
panel of IREDs available to date.11
A panel of 384 IREDs was screened for the reduction of
dehydrosalsolidine 3 (Figure S6). Formation of salsolidine4
was observed inm/z selected heat maps where both substrate
and product ions are shown (Figure 2b, see the Methods
section for dimensions and grid preparation). The reverse
reaction, i.e., oxidation of4 to 3, was also assessed using our
recently developed colorimetric screen
11 with good correlation
to the DiBT-MS method (Supporting Information,Figure S7).
Following DiBT-MS and colorimetric screening,ﬁve enzymes
were selected for analytical biotransformations in the reductive
direction (see Table S3 ). All enzymes showed excellent
conversions (>99%) and excellent enantioselectivities
(>99%) where metagenomic IREDs aﬀorded both (S)- and
(R)-4.10
Incorporation of Ion Mobility
From IRED DiBT-MS screening (Figure 2b and Figure S8),
the second 13C isotope m/z of the substrate (major ionm/z
206.1) ism/z coincident with the major product ion observed
(m/z 208.1). Since this IRED imine to amine biotransforma-
tion results in a product only two mass units higher than the
substrate, a low-intensity positive hit was identiﬁed in every
well-plate position “beneath” the genuine biotransformation
result. To remove these false positives, traveling wave ion
mobility (TWIMS)
12,13 was employed to “ﬁlter” the 13C
isotope from the product ion. Results from such a DiBT-IM-
MS screen are presented inFigure 3c, in which 5 wells of an
IRED reaction from a metagenomic plate were analyzed by this
method. Removal is possible as the major product ion (amine)
and the substrate (imine) present with diﬀering drift times
(Figure S9). The heat map data obtained without ion mobility
separation are shown alongside one another inFigure 3ct o
illustrate the removal of the underlying false positive.
Figure 1. Overview of the DiBT-MS work ﬂow for screening
biocatalytic reactions and identifying improved enzyme variants.
Initially, the reactions (whole cell or puriﬁed enzyme) are performed
within Eppendorf tubes or 96/384-well plates (1) before spotting (0.5
μL) of the quenched reaction onto a nylon membrane grid (see
photograph, Figure S1) prepared for DiBT-MS analysis (2). The
membrane containing dried spotted reactions is subjected to DiBT-
MS analysis where necessary with ion mobility (IM) separation (3),
and the resulting mass- and mobility-resolved heat maps were assessed
for wells with the highest product detection (4). The sample
remaining in the corresponding 96/384-well plate or Eppendorf tube
can then be extracted for DNA sequencing to identify the mutations
responsible for improved activity (5).

PAL Screening and Directed Evolution Case Study (Whole
Cell)
Phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) catalyze the enantiose-
lective addition of ammonia to cinnamic acids to yield L-
phenylalanine derivatives. Currently, the available suite of
PALs is limited for substrates with multiple electron-donating
substituents on the phenyl ring of both amino acid and acrylic
acid substrates.
14,15 As such, we sought to use DiBT-MS to
identify PALs able to accept electron-rich cinnamic acid
derivatives (Figure S10 and Table S4) that are present in
lignocellulosic biomass degradation (e.g., p-coumaric, ferulic,
sinapic acid). These phenylalanine derivatives are key building
blocks for biologically active molecules and active pharma-
ceutical ingredients (APIs) such as the anti-Parkinson drug L-
DOPA.
16
Initially, the activities of a panel of wild-type PALs were
compared by HPLC (Table 1, full data set in Table S5),
including enzymes from published sources and metagenomic
origin, against a broad panel of methoxy-substituted arylacrylic
acids 5a−5u (Supporting Information, Data Set S1). PbPAL

similarly; however, AL-11 showed much greater substrate
conversions to the amino acid products6a, 6d, 6f, 6g, and6h.
It is worth noting that AL-11 revealed low activity with an
electron-donating group solely at the para position (5c, 5j)
compared to PbPAL.
Moreover, AL-11 exhibited remarkable activity with di- or
trimethoxycinnamic acids (5o−5q, 5s), which are generally
inactive in the known PAL sequence space.
18 It is reasonable to
suppose that the low activity is due to not only the presence of
electron-donating groups but also a complex network of
stereoelectronic eﬀects which mean that the substituents are
more weakly bound in the enzyme active site.
Although the hydroamination reaction does not proceed
with naturally occurring lignin monomers such as ferulic acid,
to our surprise, excellent conversion (92%) and perfect
enantioselectivity (>99% ee) could be achieved with the
alkylated 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid 5o as a substrate, to
generate
L-veratrylglycine (a key building block for a variety of
biologically active molecules such as L-DOPA and anticancer
agents
19). Closer inspection of the sequence alignments
revealed slight active-site deviation from previously identiﬁed
“selectivity residues” such as the otherwise conserved amino
acid residue L90 in PbPAL which corresponds to A80 in AL-
11. This variation was predicted to allow accommodation of
the large m-MeO substituents in the active site of AL-11.
Similar evidence was discovered that introducing a leucine to
alanine point mutation in a related phenylalanine aminomutase
enzyme fromTaxus canadensis(TcPAM) increased the activity
of m-Me compounds.
20
To improve the activity of the PAL enzymes witho-MeO
substituents (5m, 5r, 5t), which gave an overall conversion of
<5%, we performed a blast sequence alignment of AL-11
against previously reported PAL homologues and found highly
conserved active site residues surrounding the electrophilic
MIO catalytic ring moiety. An energy-minimized homology
model of AL-11 was constructed from Anabaena variabilis
AvPAL
15,21 (PDB: 5LTM) with a 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid
5o ligand docked in the hydrophobic enzyme active site
(Figure 4a and Figure S11).
The ﬁrst engineering approach involved the point mutation
of the large polar amino acid residue Q84 to smaller
hydrophobic groups, which widens the substrate cavity in
close proximity to thep-substituents that gave rise to variants
such as Q84A, Q84I, and Q84V. The second approach

each pixel within each concentration spot has been summed and
plotted versus the concentration of that spot. The graph shows good
linearity between the concentration of each spot and the summed

attempted to mimic the activities of the related aromatic
ammonia lyase family members22,23 PALs/TALs/HALs that
are known to contain large hydrophobic groups (Q84F, Q84Y)
or a positively charged side chain (Q84H). Of the variants
tested under the same condition as WT using the selected test
substrate 5m, the variant Q84V had greater than 7-fold
conversion (37%) to the unnatural amino acid product. Other
point mutations were tested on the amino acid residue H85,
which proved to be overall detrimental to product conversions,
even abolishing WT activity with all substrates screened
(Figure 2c and Figure S12).
In addition to the Q84V variant and to limit the screening
eﬀorts, we created combinatorial libraries targeting neighbor-
ing active site residues N199, L196, L148, and I400
surrounding the cinnamic acid aromatic moiety using a
degenerate codon set RBT (coding for the 6 amino acids T,
S, I, G, A, V). Double mutation libraries were designed and
gave rise to a total number of 36 possible amino acid
combinations; this required screening approximately 106
clones to achieve 95% coverage.
24
DiBT-MS screening of library A (L148RBT/L196RBT)
(Figure 4b) gave few hits and revealed the crucial importance
of conserving the L148 amino acid. In accordance with a
previous report using PcPAL a large decrease in product
conversion was shown in o-MeO substituents with the
complementary conserved L206 amino acid residue mutated
to valine.
14 By contrast, the mutational changes within the
L196RBT library gave rise to conversions up to 62% and 70%
from variants L196A and L196T, respectively.
The screening of library B (N199RBT/I400RBT) (Figure
4b) detected hits where point mutations were present at the
conserved amino acid residue N199. Activity was determined
with mutated variants to the smaller hydrophobic side chain
residues (G, V, I, T), but the N199V mutation was the most
prevalent and noticeable in the DiBT-MS screening.
Interestingly, other homologues in the aromatic ammonia
lyase family exhibit this corresponding valine amino acid
residue.
22,25 In the same manner, variants of the highly
conserved I400 residue were not detected presumably due to
the critical structural role of this residue in the enzyme active
site.
After identifying amino acid hotspots from our two previous
mutagenic libraries, we sought to recombine L196RBT and
N199RBT to create library C (Figure 4b) containing the best
possible combinations. Most hits were detected in library C
with the predominantly featured L196T mutation in
combination with mutated residue N199I, N199G, or
N199V which gave >95% conversion of 5m to the
corresponding product (Figure 4c). In addition, we further
explored trisubstituted cinnamic acids5t and 5u containing the
disubstitution motif of 5m against our selected “hits” and
found variants that gave >99% conversion to the correspond-
ing
L-phenylalanine derivatives (Figure S13).
To demonstrate the practical applicability of these enzymes,
we performed preparative scale biotransformations with the
best variants for 7 of the most challenging substrates
considered in the panel ( 5m, 5o−q,a n d 5s−u). The
corresponding amino acid products were isolated in pure
form by adsorption on ion-exchange resin in good isolated
yields (68−90%) and >97% ee (Supporting Information,Data
Set S2).
■ DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
DiBT-MS screening is found to be highly e ﬀective across
diﬀerent enzyme classes (kinases, imine reductases, and
phenylalanine ammonia lyases) presented in diﬀerent formats
(puriﬁed enzymes, cell-free lysates, and whole cell reactions)
with a screening time of 42−50 s per sample (Figure 2d). This
suggests that the method will be readily adaptable to many
more reaction families, as long as the products are detectable as
ions, and we here discuss this in the context of traditional and
other emerging techniques.
Although full quanti ﬁcation by DESI-MS has not been
performed within this work, the capability for semiquantitative
measurement is certainly apparent when visually comparing
heat map intensities with reaction conversion data (%)

obtained from alternative analytical techniques (19F-NMR and
HPLC-(UV)). This method of obtaining data from the
positional mass spectra could be further optimized by applying
automated and ML approaches now emerging in mass
spectrometry imaging;
26,27 this would likely improve both
the linearity of response and the sensitivityand therefore the
throughput. Full reaction conversion data sets for both the
kinase and PAL reactions can be found inFigures S3, S4, and
S12, respectively. In each case, a brighter spot corresponds
with higher reaction conversion allowing mutants with
increased activity to be identi ﬁed for each substrate. The
method can detect products with as low as 9% conversion for
kinase puriﬁed enzyme reactions and down to 3% for the PAL
whole cell reactions. Although it may appear that intersubstrate
assessments can be made, it should be noted that, due to
substrates’ diﬀering ionization eﬃciencies and aﬃnity to the
nylon membrane, care should be taken when making such
comparisons.
The fastest throughput aﬀorded by this method corresponds
to less than ∼50 s per sample without compromising data
quality ( Figure 3 b), more than 30 times faster than an
equivalent NMR screen and with much lower solvent
consumption. Some of the fastest colorimetric andﬂuorescent
well plate readers can aﬀord throughputs of 1 well plate every
20 s (76.8 samples/s for a 1536 well plate) but do not have the
label-free capability that mass spectrometry a ﬀords. If the
products (or reactants) of interest are not inherently
ﬂuorescent or UV-active, these methods will be inappropriate.
Other mass spectrometry platforms that are capable of high-
throughput screening include those coupled to fast chromato-
graphic systems and solid-phase extraction to“clean up” the
sample before it reaches the mass spectrometer. Although this
“clean up” may be desired to optimize the MS data output, it
often utilizes excessive amounts of solvent and additional
consumables (such as columns and cartridges) which is
avoided with DiBT-MS.
Emerging ultra-high-throughput MS coupled technologies,
such as droplet microﬂuidics
28 and acoustic mist ionization
platforms, 29 are beginning to o ﬀer subsecond sample
throughputs; however, commercially available instrumentation
is still limited and in its infancy in comparison to DESI-MS.
We note that the throughput of this method could be further
improved through the implementation of robotic pipetting or
acoustic dispensing systems to perform the solution prepara-
tion steps as demonstrated by Morato et al.
30 The addition of a
slide changer within the DESI-MS instrumentation would also
increase the level of automation and throughput within the
workﬂow, allowing more samples to be analyzed consecutively
without user intervention.
The inclusion of ion mobility within this workﬂow (Figure
3c) increases identiﬁcation conﬁdence with an additional“drift
time” feature, characteristic of the product ion. This is of high
utility in reduction reactions in which the mass shift between
starting material and product diﬀers by an increase in 2m/z
units. The drift time is also diagnostic and can separate
isomeric and isobaric ions, for example, to determine the
products of a regioselective reaction.
31
■ CONCLUSION
The DiBT-MS screening platform oﬀers a facile and rapid
method for screening biocatalysts generated via directed
evolution and protein engineering strategies. It provides
product identi ﬁcation in a mobility-separated readout of
activity, in a heat map format which enables quantitative
analysis from crude reaction mixtures. The screen is performed
without the need for additional puriﬁcation, solvent extraction,
or chemical derivatization for product quantiﬁcation, which
oﬀers advantages over traditional techniques. In particular, this
method facilitates screening for in vitro activity under harsh
reaction conditions, such as the PAL-catalyzed ammonia
addition, which requires 4 M ammonium carbamate to
thermodynamically drive the hydroamination reaction to the
desired products.
■ METHODS
Materials
Commercially available reage nts were used without further
puriﬁcation. Aldehydes, malonic acid, piperidine, and all other
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO)
AlfaAesar, or Fisher Scientiﬁc. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide
kinase, T4 DNA ligase, Q5 high-ﬁdelity DNA polymerase, and broad
range protein marker (12 −250 kDa) were purchased from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21
(DE3) cells were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich,
MA). Expression vector pET-28b was purchased from Novagen
(Darmstadt, Germany) and was used for gene expression. HPLCﬁlter
vials 0.45uM PVDF with a pre-slit cap were bought from Thomson
(California, USA). LB broth base including trace elements was
supplied by Formedium (Norfolk, UK). Synthesized oligonucleotides
were purchased from Euroﬁns Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany).
General Methods
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400
spectrometer (400.1 MHz) without an additional internal standard.
Chemical shifts are reported asδ in parts per million (ppm) and are
calibrated against the residual solvent signal.
Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 Series LC
system equipped with a G1379A degasser, a G1312A binary pump, a
G1329 autosampler unit, a G1316A temperature-controlled column
compartment, and a G1315B diode array detector.
Analysis Surface Preparation
Nylon membranes (Roche, 82 mm diameter) were cut to size,
allowing for a 25 mm2 area per sample. Cut membranes wereﬁxed to
a glass slide with double-sided tape ensuring aﬂat surface, and sample
areas (5 mm× 5 mm) were marked with a scalpel in a grid formation
(Figure S1). Excess tape was removed from around the membrane.
Kinase Biotransformations and19F NMR Analysis
Reactions were carried out in Tris buﬀer (50μL, 100 mM, pH 8.0) at
37 °C for 24 h. The mixture contained monosaccharide (8 mM), ATP
(10 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), and GalK or NahK (6μg, ﬁnal kinase
concentration 0.12 mg mL−1). The presence of the sugar-1-phosphate
product was determined by HRMS, and the conversion was
determined quantitatively by
19F NMR, according to the following
method. Samples (50μL) were diluted with MeOH/H2O (1:1, 450
μL) and centrifuged (10 000g, 5 min) to remove any insoluble matter.
The solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube, with a sealed glass
capillary tube containing D2O for locking and referencing.19F NMR
spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz
spectrometer (operating at 470 MHz) equipped with a QCI-F
cryoprobe. Conversions were determined by taking the relative
integration of the corresponding resonances of the starting material
and product, which were typically baseline-separated.
8
For DiBT screening, reactions wereﬁrst diluted with MeOH/H2O
(1:1, 300−450 μL). 0.5 μL of each solution was transferred onto a
preprepared nylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as

colony was selected and grown in a 3 mL overnight starter culture
supplemented with 50μgm L−1 kanamycin at 37°C at 200 rpm. The
freshly prepared starter culture was used to inoculate 500 mL of LB-
based autoinduction media containing 50μgm L−1 kanamycin in 2 L
baﬄed ﬂasks at a rotary shaking rate of 200 rpm at 18°C for 72 h.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4°C, 3250g, 20 min). The
cells were resuspended with KP i buﬀer (100 mM, pH 8.0) and
harvested again by centrifugation (4 °C, 3250g, 20 min). The cell
pellet was subsequently aliquoted and stored at−20 °C.
The whole cell biotransformation was conducted by resuspending
50 mg mL−1 cell paste in an appropriate volume of ammonium
carbamate solution (4 M, pH∼ 9.9, unadjusted) supplemented with
the relevant arylacrylic acid5a−5u at the required concentration (5
mM for screening, 10 −20 mM for preparative applications). All
biotransformations were performed at 30°C with agitation of 250
rpm. After a 24 h incubation period, the samples were centrifuged (5
min, 13 000 rpm) to remove cell debris. The crude supernatant was
then dissolved in 50% MeOH (v/v), and 500μL was transferred to a
0.45 mmﬁlter vial for analysis by HPLC with the remaining solution
reserved for analysis.
Conversion values for the PAL reactions of arylacrylic acids5a−5u
were determined by HPLC on a nonchiral reverse-phase Zorbax C-18
Extend column (50 mm× 4.6 mm × 3.5 μm, Agilent), ﬂow rate 1.0
mL min−1, temperature 40°C, detection wavelength 210 nm. Mobile
phase: aq NH 4OH 0.1 M pH 10.0/MeOH, 9:1. For DESI-MS
analysis, 0.5 μL of each solution was transferred onto a preprepared
nylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as detailed above and
allowed to air-dry before analysis.
Enantiomeric excess (ee) values for the isolated PAL reaction
products were determined by HPLC on a chiral reverse-phase
Crownpak CR(+)column (150 mm× 4m m× 3.5 μm, Daicel),ﬂow
rate 1.0 mL min−1, temperature 40°C, detection wavelength 210 nm.
Mobile phase: aq HClO4 1.14% w/v/MeOH, 85:15.
Preparative scale PAL reactions were performed as described above
for analytical scale reactions, with an increased substrate concen-
tration (10−20 mM) and addition of DMSO (5% v/v) as a cosolvent.
Products were isolated by adsorption on ion exchange Dowex 50WX8
resin and elution with ammonium hydroxide solution (as described
previously
17).
Screening of Metagenomic IREDs
A 384-well ﬂat-bottomed plate containing a 0.5 mg CFE plate was
acclimatized to room temperature. Each well was then resuspended to
10 mg mL
−1 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. To a 384-well deep-well plate
(Corning), the following solution was dispensed: 10 mM 6,7-
dimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline, 50 mM glucose, 0.5
mM NADP+, 0.5 mg mL−1 GDH (CDX-901), and 4 mg mL−1 IRED
lysate, made up to a total reaction volume of 50μL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl
pH 8.0. The plate was then sealed and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 1 min).
The 384-deep-well plate was then incubated at 30°C for 24 h at 1000
rpm. The reaction was then quenched with the addition of 50:50
MeOH/H
2O and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 1 min) before DiBT-MS
screening. 0.5 μL from each well was transferred onto a preprepared
nylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as detailed above and
allowed to air-dry before DiBT-MS analysis.
Singular IRED Biotransformations
Stock solutions of the IREDs were prepared (pIR-2, pIR-9, pIR-170,
pIR-204, and pIR-364) by weighing out crude lyophilized cell-free
extract and rehydrated to a concentration of 10 mg mL
−1 in 0.1 M
Tris-HCl buﬀer pH 8.0. Biotransformations were performed on a 500
μL scale. The reaction mixture contained 10 mM dehydrosalsolidine3
(6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-dihydroisoquinoline), 50 mM D-
glucose, 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.5 mg mL−1 GDH (Codexis-901), 4 mg
mL−1 IRED lysate, or 1 mg mL−1 AspRedAm (IMAC grade puriﬁed);
the reaction volume was made up to 500μL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buﬀer
pH 8.0. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Reactions were
quenched by the addition of 50μL of 10 M NaOH and extracted
twice with 750 μLo f tert-butyl methyl ester. The organic fractions
were combined and dried by MgSO4 and analyzed by HPLC on chiral
stationary phase.10
384-Well IRED Colorimetric Screen
A Mastermix reagent was made up to 25 mL, containing 0.125 mg
mL−1 INT and 10 mM amine substrate in Tris-HCl (0.1 M) adjusted
to pH 9.0. 50μL of the Mastermix was aliquoted to each well of the
plate. The plate was then spun down (1000 rpm, 1 min) and the 384-
well pierceable seal (4titude, Surrey, UK) removed. The plate was
incubated (in the dark) at 30°C for 24 h. An absorbance reading atλ
= 490 nm was taken at 0, 1, 4, and 24 h. False positives were detected
in wells B02, D08, F12, H21, I02, I07, K16, O01, O08, and P17 from
the reaction of the enzyme with INT to INT-formazan as previously
described elsewhere.
11 The same procedure was followed for the 384
IREDy-to-go blank plate, except no amine was added to the
Mastermix.
Instrumentation
All DiBT-MS experiments were performed on a SYNAPT G2 Si mass
spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) coupled with a
DESI 2D Omni spray ion source (Prosolia, Indianapolis, IN).
DESI Source
DESI solvent was composed of a methanol−water mixture (49:1) at a
ﬂow rate of 2.5μL min−1. Nitrogen gasﬂow (3 bar) and a capillary
voltage of 3.5 kV or 4.0 kV (+ve/−ve respectively) were used to
generate an electrospray plume toward the surface of interest. The
DESI sprayer position was then adjusted to ensure that optimum
signal intensity was achieved from a solution of the product dried on a
nylon membrane. The sampling area was deﬁned by HD Imaging
software V1.4 (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) with pixel size
and stage speed deﬁned as per the throughput of the experiment
(Figure 3b).
Mass Spectrometer
The mass spectrometer was operated using MassLynx v4.2 (Waters
Corporation, Manchester, UK), with the source cone voltage
optimized around 60 V and a source temperature of 150°C. The
trap and transfer cell voltages were set at 4 and 2 V, respectively. All
mass spectrometry data were processed (0.2 Da window, 20 000
resolution, top 10 000 peaks) and heat maps analyzed using HD
imaging software.
