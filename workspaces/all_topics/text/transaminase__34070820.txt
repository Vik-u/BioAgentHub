Abstract: New bio-based polymers capable of either outperforming fossil-based alternatives or
possessing new properties and functionalities are of relevant interest in the framework of the circular
economy. In this work, a novel bio-based polycarvone acrylate di-epoxide (PCADE) was used as an
additive in a one-step straightforward electrospinning process to endow the ﬁbres with functionalis-
able epoxy groups at their surface. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, poly(vinylidene
ﬂuoride) (PVDF) ﬁbres loaded with different amounts of PCADE were prepared. A thorough char-
acterisation by TGA, DSC, DMTA and XPS showed that the two polymers are immiscible and that
PCADE preferentially segregates at the ﬁbre surface, thus developing a very simple one-step ap-
proach to the preparation of ready-to-use surface functionalisable ﬁbres. We demonstrated this by
exploiting the epoxy groups at the PVDF ﬁbre surface in two very different applications, namely
in epoxy-based carbon ﬁbre reinforced composites and membranes for ω-transaminase enzyme
immobilisation for heterogeneous catalysis.

1. Introduction
The valorisation of waste streams from agricultural and industrial sources into a bio-
based supply chain for the production of valuable materials is a central topic of the circular
economy [1,2]. A great deal of effort is currently undertaken by the bio-based industries and
research centres to ﬁnd and exploit new waste sources as well as to implement bioreﬁnery
technologies and pathways towards cost-competitive products with low environmental
impact. Competitive bio-based polymers must demonstrate cost and/or performance
improvements with respect to fossil-based alternatives. In particular, bio-based plastics can
become particularly relevant if their properties outperform those of conventional plastics
in advanced applications [3–5].
As biomass feedstocks, terpenes show great promise because they are affordable
and available at scale for polymerisation. As an example, polymers synthesised using

limonene as feedstock are among the top 20 most innovative bio-based products showing
the greatest promise for commercial deployment within the next 5–10 years [6]. Terpene
derivatives can be used to synthesise several types of homopolymers and copolymers
with a range of properties [7], including polyesters [8], polyamides [9], polyurethanes [10]
and polycarbonates [11]. Besides the plastic industry, terpenes are of relevant interest as
protective agents [12], green solvents [13] and catalysts [14].
In this framework, we have recently demonstrated the synthesis of a novel polycar-
vone acrylate di-epoxide (PCADE) as a less toxic and bio-based alternative to poly(glycidyl
methacrylate) [15]. The most intriguing aspect of this polymer is the presence of two epoxy
groups per repeating unit, potentially exploitable for chemical modiﬁcations, thus making
PCADE a platform for the synthesis of multi-functional materials. Additionally, it could be
envisaged that the polymer may be employed as a surface coater and promoter of surface
chemical modiﬁcations to achieve speciﬁc functionalities. Surface functionalisation is a
relevant topic on a technologically point of view since it can improve substrate performance
with minimal effects on bulk properties. Materials with high surface-to-volume ratio, a
typical example being electrospun submicrometric ﬁbres, could achieve enormous beneﬁt
from the use of PCADE as a promoter of surface functionalisation. Brieﬂy, electrospinning
uses electrostatic forces to stretch a viscoelastic polymer solution and produces ﬁbres with
diameters in the range of few tenths of nanometers to a few micrometers. Fibres are de-
posited on a collector as non-wovens, having mesh porosity typically higher than 80% and
pore diameters that can vary from a few to tens of micrometers [16,17]. Electrospun ﬁbres
can be exploited for a range of applications, including ﬁltration, sensors, catalytic systems,
in energy harvesting/conversion/storage, in structural composites and in biomedical
applications. Moreover, electrospinning not only is a consolidate technology on a lab-scale
level but the scaling up has been realised in the past decade by several companies.
The possibility to easily control and modify the surface properties of electrospun ﬁbres
is crucial for many applications and several approaches can be envisaged [ 18], such as
plasma treatments [19–21], physical vapour deposition [ 22,23] and covalent grafting of
polymers and other active species [24–28]. Covalent modiﬁcation is the preferred approach
to achieve speciﬁc and efﬁcient ﬁbre surface functionalisation, albeit often it requires
multiple steps, including the generation of anchor functionalities on the ﬁbre surface,
followed by the attachment of linking agents, if needed, and eventually the introduction
of molecules providing the desired functionality. To avoid multiple steps and elaborate
synthetic pathways, the spontaneous surface segregation of a functional additive at the
ﬁbre surface during electrospinning process can be exploited [29,30].
In the present work PCADE was used as surface modiﬁer of the ﬁbres and electrospun
in blend with poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF). A low molecular weight PCADE was
intentionally employed to promote its migration towards the jet surface during electro-
spinning to obtain an epoxy-enriched ﬁbre surface. The two polymers were blended in
different ratios, in order to tailor the ﬁbre toughness and the epoxy content at ﬁbre surface.
The resulting non-wovens were thoroughly characterised to determine their morphol-
ogy, phase separation, bulk and surface chemical composition and mechanical properties.
PVDF/PCADE electrospun ﬁbres were then tested in two different applications where the
surface chemistry is of paramount importance—as second ﬁllers in Carbon Fibre Reinforced
Polymers (CFRP) and to form membranes for enzyme immobilisation for heterogeneous
catalysis (Figure 1).

2.1. Fibre Production and Characterisation
2.1.1. Materials
Poly(carvone acrylate di-epoxide) (PCADE, Mn = 2800 g mol −1, PDI = 1.5) was
synthesised as previously described [ 15] and reported in the Supplementary Materials
(Figures S1 and S2). Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF, 6008, Solef) was kindly provided by
Solvay Specialty Polymers. Acetone (Ac, ACS reagent, 99.5%) and dimethylformamide
(DMF, ACS reagent, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without fur-
ther puriﬁcation.
2.1.2. Electrospinning
Nanoﬁbrous mats were fabricated using a laboratory electrospinning machine (Spin-
bow Lab Unit, Spinbow S.r.1., Bologna, Italy), equipped with a linear sliding spinneret
carrying two syringes ejecting the same polymer solution at a rate of 1.2 mL h −1 and
connected to two stainless-steel blunt-ended needles (inner diameter= 0.51 mm) with PTFE
tubes. A drum collector (diameter = 150 mm; length = 500 mm) rotating at 50 rpm and
positioned 23 cm away from the needles was used as collector. PVDF mats were prepared
from a 18% (w/v) solution of PVDF dissolved in Ac:DMF=60:40 (v/v), by applying a volt-
age of 17 kV . PVDF/PCADE 85/15 (w/w) and PVDF/PCADE 70/30 (w/w) were prepared
from 18% (w/v) polymer solutions in Ac:DMF = 70:30 (v/v), by applying a voltage of 25
and 26 kV , respectively. In a typical preparation, 1.53 g of PVDF and 0.27 g of PCADE were
dissolved in 10 mL to prepare PVDF/PCADE 85/15, whereas 1.26 g of PVDF and 0.54 of
PCADE were dissolved in 10 mL to prepare PVDF/PCADE 70/30. Electrospinning was
performed at room temperature (RT) and relative humidity 30–40%. The electrospinning
process was carried out until the thickness of the mat was about 40 µm.
2.1.3. Characterisation Techniques
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Zeiss LEO 1530 FE-SEM,
operated at 5 kV . Samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to SEM observations. and
observed with an In-lens SE detector. The distribution of ﬁbre diameters was determined
through the measurement of about 100 ﬁbres and the results are given as the average
diameter ±standard deviation (SD). The one-way ANOVA was used to test the statistical
signiﬁcance of the difference between the mean values (p < 0.001).
XPS spectra were recorded with a VG Microtech spectrometer with a CLAMII anal-
yser. The X-ray source (Mg Kα1,2, 1253.6 eV) worked at 100 kV and 10 mA at a pressure
< 2 ×10−8 Torr. Pass energy: 100 eV for wide scans, 50 eV for narrow scans. The spectra
were recorded with taking-off angles of 45 ◦. All data analyses (linear background sub-
traction and peak integration) were accomplished using PeakFit software (v.4 by SPSS).
Binding energies were referenced to the C-H level at 285.0 eV .

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a TA instruments Q500
thermogravimetric analyser. Analyses were performed from RT to 700 ◦C, at a heating rate
of 10 ◦C min−1, under air ﬂow.
Thermal transitions were measured by means of a TA Instruments differential scanning
calorimeter, DSC Q100, equipped with a refrigerated cooling system (RCS). Samples were
subjected to a ﬁrst heating scan at 10 ◦C min−1 from −50 ◦C up to 120 ◦C, a controlled
cooling at 10◦C min−1 up to −50◦C and a second heating scan at 10 ◦C min−1.
Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was carried out on electrospun strips
(gauge length about 10 mm) by means of a TA Instruments dynamic mechanical, analyser
DMA Q800, under a tensile conﬁguration. The specimens were tested within a heating
ramp from −90 ◦C to 100 ◦C at 3 ◦C min−1, adopting a frequency of 1 Hz under displace-
ment control.
Stress−strain measurements of the mats were performed on an Instron 4465 tensile
testing machine equipped with a 100 N load cell. Samples 5 mm wide with a gauge
length of 30 mm were pre-clamped on a paper frame following the procedure described in
Maccaferri et al. [31]. The tensile test was performed at 10 mm min−1 and for each sample
six replicate specimens were tested for each type of mat. The stress (σ) was normalised to
the real material cross section according to the following equation:
σ = ρ F
m L (1)
where ρ is the material bulk density (approximated to PVDF density for all types of mat),
m is the specimen’s mass,L is specimen’s initial length andF is the force. Elastic modulus
(E), maximum stress (σmax), maximum deformation (εmax) and absorbed strain energy (U)
of the electrospun samples were provided as mean ±standard deviation.
2.2. Carbon Fibre Composites
2.2.1. Materials
Twill 200 gsm carbon-epoxy prepreg (GG204T-IMP503Z), supplied by Angeloni S.r.l.,
was chosen as the base material. The epoxy resin, according to the supplier datasheet, is
based on diglycidyl ether bisphenol A and has a glass transition temperature of 120 ◦C
after curing.
2.2.2. Epoxy Resin−Electrospun Nanoﬁbres Composites
The uncured epoxy was prepared at RT by mixing the pre-polymer and the curing
agent at a ratio 100/30 ( w/w) (according to manufacturer’s instructions) and degassed
under vacuum. To produce epoxy−nanoﬁbre composites a rectangular electrospun mem-
brane was placed on a PTFE ﬁlm and the uncured epoxy mixture was gently poured
onto it to get a complete impregnation. The excess of uncured resin was eliminated by
using ﬁlter paper. The impregnated mat was then heated to 90 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C h−1,
followed by an isotherm at 90 ◦C for 1 h. Samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen for
SEM characterisation.
2.2.3. CFRP Nano-Interleaved Composite Laminate
Four types of laminates, with dimensions of 120 ×170 mm2, were manufactured by
stacking 14 plies of CFRP prepreg: (i) an unmodiﬁed laminate (FRP-Virgin), (ii) a PVDF
nano-interleaved laminate (FRP-PVDF), (iii) a PVDF/PCADE 85/15 nano-interleaved
laminate (FRP-85/15) and (iv) a PVDF/PCADE 70/30 nano-interleaved laminate (FRP-
70/30). A PTFE ﬁlm (30 µm thick) was inserted in the ply book mid-plane, in order to
trigger the crack. For the nano-interleaved laminates, nanoﬁbrous mats were integrated
in the mid-layer, following the procedure described in Brugo et al. [32]. Laminates were
cured in an autoclave with a two-stage cycle—a ﬁrst isotherm at 70 ◦C for 30 min and a
second one at 135 ◦C for 120 min, with a heating and cooling rate of 2.5 ◦C min−1. Vacuum
bag and autoclave pressure were 900 mbar and 6 bar, respectively (Figure S3).

2.2.4. Characterisation Techniques
Mode-I fracture tests were carried out on a servo-hydraulic testing machine, Instron
8033, equipped with a 2 kN load cell, under displacement control condition at a constant
speed of 1.5 mm min−1. Double cantilever beam (DCB) samples were prepared according
to the ASTM D5528 standard [ 33]: 140 mm long, 20 mm wide, with an initial crack of
45 mm and two aluminum blocks glued on the tip for clamping.
The energy release rate for mode-I ( GI) testing was obtained by the beam theory
method (BTM), described in Equation (2):
GI = 3Pδ
2Ba (2)
where P is the load, δ is the crack opening displacement, B is the specimen width and a is
the crack length. Three DCB specimens for each kind of sample, extracted from each of the
four laminate types, were tested and results were provided as mean ±standard deviation.
During each test, load and displacement were recorded and the crack propagation was
visually controlled by means of a high-resolution camera focusing on a ruler ﬁxed on the
side of the specimen.
2.3. Enzyme Immobilisation
2.3.1. Materials
Iminodiacetic acid (IDA), (S)-(–)-α-methylbenzylamine, sodium pyruvate, pyridoxal
5′-phosphate (PLP), monobasic potassium phosphate, dibasic potassium phosphate, sodium
borate, sodium chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and cobalt (II) chloride were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.3.2. Immobilisation of HeWT on Metal-Derivatised PVDF/PCADE 70/30 Membranes
ω-transaminase from Halomonas elongata(HeWT) was expressed and puriﬁed as pre-
viously described [34]. HeWT was covalently immobilised on PVDF/PCADE 70/30 mem-
branes partially derivatised with Co2+ groups, following a previously reported two-step
immobilisation strategy [35]. Brieﬂy, epoxy groups of PVDF/PCADE 70/30 ﬁbres were
partially modiﬁed with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) by adding 500 mL gmembrane−1 solution of
0.1 M sodium borate 2 M IDA 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 8.5, and incubating under
gentle shaking for 2 h and 102 h at RT. The resulting modiﬁed membranes, 2hIDA and
102hIDA membranes, were washed with H2O and added to 5 mL gmembrane−1 solution of
1M NaCl 5 mg mL−1 CoCl2 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6 to coordinate carboxylic
acids groups of IDA with Co 2+. The mixtures were incubated under gentle shaking for
3 h at RT, and resulting partially Co 2+-derivatised membranes, Co2+-2hIDA- and Co2+-
102hIDA membranes, were washed with H2O. A solution of HeWT in 50 mM potassium
phosphate pH 8 was added to Co2+-2hIDA- and Co2+-102hIDA membranes at a ratio of
10 mgHeWT gmembrane−1 and the immobilisation mixtures were incubated under gentle
shaking for 18 h at RT. Samples from the liquid phase were taken at different time points,
and ω-transaminase activity was measured. After immobilisation, imm-HeWT membranes
(imm-HeWT-Co2+-2hIDA and imm-HeWT-Co2+-102hIDA membranes) were washed with
H2O and used to assess the recovered activity. In addition, imm-HeWT membranes were
incubated in water at 90 ◦C for 1 h. A sample of the liquid phase was taken and analysed
by SDS-page electrophoresis.
2.3.3. ω-Transaminase Activity Assay and Protein Determination
Enzymatic activity was determined following the production of acetophenone using a
standard enzymatic assay as reported by Cerioli et al. [34]. Concentration of the puriﬁed
protein was determined spectrophotometrically as described by Cerioli et al. [ 34]. The
immobilised activity, U gmembrane−1, is deﬁned as the difference between initial offered
activity per gram of membrane and remaining activity in the liquid phase per gram of
Polymers 2021, 13, 1804 6 of 18
membrane at immobilisation end point. The immobilisation yield (%) is deﬁned as the
ratio between immobilised activity, and initial offered activity per gram of membrane.
2.3.4. Recovered Activity Assay after Immobilisation on Membranes
The activity of the immobilised HeWT was determined by weighing an appropri-
ate amount of imm-HeWT membranes (imm-HeWT-Co2+-2hIDA- and imm-HeWT-Co2+-
102hIDA membranes) followed by the addition of 400 mL g membrane-1 reaction mixture
(50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 8; 2.5 mM (S)-(–)-α-methylbenzylamine; 2.5 mM
pyruvate; 0.25% DMSO; and 0.1 mM pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP)). The immobilised
enzyme reaction mixture was gently shaken for 10 min at 25 ◦C, and the absorbance at
245 nm was recorded every 2 min as single readings using UV-96-well plates. The recovered
activity in U gmembrane−1 is deﬁned as µmol of acetophenone formed per minute per gram
of imm-HeWT membrane. The percentage of recovered activity (%) is deﬁned as the ratio
between recovered activity in U gmembrane−1 and immobilised activity in U gmembrane−1.
3. Results
3.1. PVDF/PCADE Electrospun Samples
PCADE can be readily synthesised via free radical polymerisation of carvone acry-
late di-epoxide, achieving a reasonable control of molecular weight between 2000 Da and
32,000 Da, with the addition of dodecane thiol as transfer agent and different monomer con-
centration (see Supplementary Materials for details) [15]. In a ﬁrst attempt, PCADE with the
highest molecular weight (Mn = 32,000 g mol−1, Ð = 2.1) was electrospun to produce single-
component ﬁbres. The electrospinning process was successful (Figure S4), meaning that
in the selected solvent mixture the critical concentration for entanglements was achieved,
leading to beaded ﬁbres that turned into continuous ﬁbres upon the increase of solution
concentration [36,37]. However, pure PCADE ﬁbres were discontinuous and extremely
fragile due to the polymer’s poor mechanical properties. To improve ﬁbre mechanical
properties, a second polymer was thus used in combination with PCADE. PVDF was
chosen as the main constituent of the electrospun ﬁbres due to its high mechanical strength
and chemical, thermal and electrical stabilities [38]. This specialty polymer is widely used
in high-tech applications: membranes for water treatment, gas separation, membrane
distillation and lithium-ion batteries [39,40] and sensors, transducers, energy harvesting
devices and actuators because of its ferroelectric and piezoelectricproperties [41,42]. PVDF
is a rather inert and chemically stable fossil-based polymer that we intend to modify with
the addition of the bio-based PCADE to confer to the ﬁnal product a partial bio-based
content and as well as new chemical groups for further functionalisation. For the prepara-
tion of PVDF/PCADE ﬁbres, we intentionally employed a low molecular weight PCADE
(Mn = 2800 g mol−1, Ð = 1.5) to exploit the tendency of low-molecular-weight compounds
to migrate towards the jet surface during electrospinning and thus to obtain epoxy-enriched
ﬁbre surface [29,30,43–45].
PVDF and PCADE were blended in different ratios to tailor ﬁbre toughness and epoxy
content at the ﬁbre surface. The resulting mats were characterised to determine their mor-
phology, thermal and mechanical properties, and bulk and surface chemical composition.
Three kinds of electrospun samples were produced, one of pure PVDF, to be used as a
reference, and two PVDF/PCADE blends in 85/15 and 70/30 ratio ( w/w). Continuous
ﬁbres were obtained in each case with diameters of 720 ±180 nm (PVDF), 400 ±150 nm
(PVDF/PCADE 85/15) and 300 ±80 nm (PVDF/PCADE 70/30) (Figure 2 and Figure S5). It
is evident that ﬁbre diameter signiﬁcantly decreases with the addition of PCADE (p < 0.001
PVDF vs. PVDF/PCADE 85/15) and further decreases when the concentration of PCADE
reaches the 30 wt% ( p < 0.001 PVDF/PCADE 85/15 vs. PVDF/PCADE 70/30). This is
determined by the reduced solution viscosity occurring when the high molecular weight
PVDF is partially replaced with the low molecular weight PCADE. The decrease of ﬁbre

DSC analysis was performed to gain information on the miscibility of PVDF and
PCADE in the electrospun ﬁbres. Figure 3a reports the ﬁrst heating scans and Figure 3b is
the corresponding enlargement of the glass transition region; Figure 3c,d, similarly, report
the second heating scans after quench. DSC of PVDF ﬁbres clearly shows that this polymer
is highly semicrystalline, with a ﬁrst heating scan characterised by a broad and intense
multi-peak melting endotherm in the range 30–180 ◦C, without a detectable stepwise
speciﬁc heat increment that can be ascribed to the glass transition (Figure 3a,b, black curve).
The low-T endotherm centered at 69 ◦C, typical of PVDF annealed at RT, has been ascribed
to unstable secondary crystals [46] and disappears in the second heating scan (Figure 3c,d,
black curve). After quenching the Tg of PVDF is just detectable at −45 ◦C. Conversely,
PCADE (Figure 3a,b, green curve) is entirely amorphous, with a Tg = 58 ◦C characterised
by a remarkable enthalpy relaxation peak due to physical ageing, that disappears in the
second heating scan after quench (Figure 3c,d, green curve). As a general rule, in the case
of immiscible blends there are two distinct glass transitions at temperatures matching those
of the pure components, with magnitudes proportional to the corresponding component in
the blend. In the ﬁrst heating scans of both PVDF/PCADE blends (Figure 3a,b) no evident
change of the baseline is detectable up to 30 ◦C. In the range 30–85 ◦C several phenomena
apparently overlap: (i) the low-T melting endotherm of PVDF component, (ii) the Tg of
the PCADE component and (iii) the relative relaxation peak due to physical ageing, whose
intensity is higher for the blend richer in PCADE. In the range 140–180 ◦C the curves show
the main endotherm melting of the PVDF crystal phase. The high tendency of the PVDF
component to crystallise prevents the detection of its Tg. In addition, the overlapping of
thermal transitions of the pure components makes the interpretation of DSC curves in the
Polymers 2021, 13, 1804 8 of 18
ﬁrst heating scan difﬁcult. After quench (Figure 3c,d), the crystallinity of PVDF component
is reduced and any physical ageing phenomenon is erased; both blends display a modest
stepwise change of the baseline at−45 ◦C, corresponding to theTg of pure PVDF, providing
evidence of PVDF−PCADE phase separation, albeit in the range 30–85◦C no remarkable
differences can be detected. DMTA analysis was carried out to better shed light on the
compatibility between PVDF and PCADE (Figure 3e). In the blends, the storage modulus
shows two distinct and well-resolved decrements, detected at temperatures unaffected
by blend composition and closely matching the pure components’ Tg. Moreover, it is
found that the magnitude of each decrement changes in proportion to the amount of the
corresponding component in the blend, providing good evidence that PVDF and PCADE
are immiscible in the ﬁbres.

TGA analysis (Figure 3f) highlights that the two polymers thermally degrade in
different temperature intervals: PVDF is stable up to 400 ◦C and shows two degradative
steps; PCADE shows the onset of the ﬁrst degradative step at about 180◦C and continuously
loses weight up to complete degradation at 550 ◦C. In the blends, three main steps of
degradation are detectable, the ﬁrst one ascribable to PCADE and the others to PVDF.
As the amount of PCADE in the ﬁbres increases, the amount of material degraded in
the ﬁrst step of degradation increases as well. In particular, the nominal compositions of
PVDF/PCADE at the weight ratios of 85/15 and 70/30 are conﬁrmed by TGA analysis:
83/17 and 68/32 weight ratios, respectively.
XPS analysis was used to quantify the polymer composition at the ﬁbre surface. The
peak ﬁtting elaboration was carried out on the sample C1s envelopes ( Figure S6 and S7,
Table S1). In the C1s envelope of PVDF/PCADE samples new peaks appear when com-
pared with PVDF, in line with the different chemical composition of PVDF and PCADE.
The relative abundance of new peaks was considered to calculate the surface composition.
The experimental results differ signiﬁcantly from the theoretical values calculated with the
assumption that PCADE is homogeneously distributed along ﬁbre cross-section (Table 1).
While the lower F/C ratio could be due to the presence of hydrocarbon contamination,
usually observed in XPS analysis of polymer systems, the higher oxygen content apparent
in both O/C and F/O ratios could be explained by a preferential segregation of the PCADE
onto the outer sample layers. The amount of PCADE present on the surface has been
calculated from the F/O atomic ratio and from the correction from hydrocarbon contami-
nation (Supplementary Materials). The results show that there is likely signiﬁcant surface
enrichment in PCADE.

The mechanical behaviours of the three different electrospun mats are reported
through stress−strain curves (Figure 4a and Table 2). It is pointed out that pure PCADE
ﬁbres were too fragile to be tested, as the mat could not be ﬁxed to the clamps without
being damaged. Stress−strain curves of the tested samples are characterised by a linear
elastic region and a yield point followed by a plastic deformation. Both the elastic modulus
and maximum stress at break grow linearly with increasing the percentage amount of the
PCADE (Figure 4b). However, the absorbed strain energy is lower for the blends compared
to the pristine PVDF nanoﬁbres, due to the presence of the glassy phase of PCADE that
reduces the maximum strain at break. Overall, the addition of PCADE confers a stiffer and
stronger character to the ﬁbres that, concomitantly, become less tough.

3.2. Epoxide-Based Composites
Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) are structurally versatile materials em-
ployed in all ﬁelds where high speciﬁc strength is required [47]. Among them, the epoxide-
based composites are widely used in load-bearing applications, e.g., automotive, aerospace,
construction, because of their good mechanical properties, high speciﬁc strength and
super adhesiveness as well as good heat and solvent resistance [ 48]. In the last decade,
the speciﬁc features of electrospun ﬁbres, namely high aspect ratio, uniform dispersion
within the matrix and high surface area to volume ratio, makes them ideal candidates
as second-phase ﬁllers in CFRP laminates, proving to affect mechanical performances by
improving, for instance, delamination resistance [49–51]. Different polymeric nanoﬁbres,
such as nylon 6,6 [52–54], and PVDF [55], have been successfully employed with a global
effect of increasing mode I strain energy release rate (GI) and mode II strain energy release
rate (GII), albeit reported results can be extremely variable [49]. Due to the complexity of
these three-phase systems, a universal agreement on the reasons for changes in mechanical
properties has still to be reached, but there seems to be a certain consensus about some
factors [56]. In particular, (i) poor adhesion between ﬁllers and matrix creates voids in the
material, imposing a tortuous crack propagation [57,58], (ii) chemical interactions between
ﬁller and matrix cause substantial changes in the properties of the interfacial region [59–62]
and (iii) the ﬁller can slow down crack propagation by pinning and deﬂecting mechanisms,
according to its size and tenacity [63–65].
Polymers 2021, 13, 1804 11 of 18
Undoubtedly, the use of nanoﬁbres determines a dramatic increase of the matrix–ﬁller
interface, hence good ﬁbre–matrix interaction is crucial for achieving an efﬁcient load
transfer from polymer matrix to nanoﬁbre ﬁllers [ 66–68]. In this context, the epoxy-rich
surface of PVDF/PCADE ﬁbres is expected to provide a good interfacial bonding with an
epoxy resin, promoting crosslinking across the interface by reacting with the amine groups
of the hardener. SEM images of the epoxy resin ﬁlled with the different types of ﬁbre
are reported in Figure 5, as cross-sections obtained by brittle fracture in liquid nitrogen.
As expected, the adhesion between the nanoﬁbres and the epoxy matrix increases with
the amount of PCADE in the ﬁbres, this is evident by observing SEM images acquired at
higher magniﬁcation.

it is enhanced by only 29% and 6%, respectively.

The different R
-
curve trends between the laminates with PVDF and PVDF/PCADE 
could be explained by considering the effect of the crack tip shape (Figure 6d). At crack 
initiation, the notch artificially induced by a Teflon sheet is blunt and therefore crack 
ini-
tiation is less sensitive to the material toughness. Differently, at crack propagation, the 
crack tip is sharp and, for a purely elastic material, the stress in the proximity could rise 
theoretically at infinite, leading to breakage. A tough material, d
eforming plastically, can 
reduce the stress gradient at the crack tip hindering its propagation 
[6

]
. With this as-
sumption, the effect of the different nanofibres on nano
-
interleaved composite mechanical 
properties can be explained in terms of fibre toughness
—
PVDF/PCADE blends, having a 
low
er toughness compared to PVDF, (as evidenced by the tensile tests), can only increase 
the fracture toughness of the hosting laminate at crack initiation but slightly at propaga-
tion, when the crack becomes sharper. The result is that using PVDF/PCADE fibres
 
it is 
possible to improve the fracture toughness of the composite laminate at damage initiation 
and, at the same time, the good adhesion with the matrix generates zones where the crack 
easily propagates upon the formation of sharp crack tips. Such a behav
iour could be ap-
plied in the construction of the sacrificial part of safety devices, where a complete material 
failure is required once a specific force threshold
 
is 
reached

The different R-curve trends between the laminates with PVDF and PVDF/PCADE
could be explained by considering the effect of the crack tip shape (Figure 6d). At crack
initiation, the notch artiﬁcially induced by a Teﬂon sheet is blunt and therefore crack
initiation is less sensitive to the material toughness. Differently, at crack propagation,
the crack tip is sharp and, for a purely elastic material, the stress in the proximity could
rise theoretically at inﬁnite, leading to breakage. A tough material, deforming plastically,
can reduce the stress gradient at the crack tip hindering its propagation [ 69]. With this
assumption, the effect of the different nanoﬁbres on nano-interleaved composite mechanical
properties can be explained in terms of ﬁbre toughness—PVDF/PCADE blends, having a
lower toughness compared to PVDF, (as evidenced by the tensile tests), can only increase
the fracture toughness of the hosting laminate at crack initiation but slightly at propagation,
when the crack becomes sharper. The result is that using PVDF/PCADE ﬁbres it is possible
to improve the fracture toughness of the composite laminate at damage initiation and, at
the same time, the good adhesion with the matrix generates zones where the crack easily
propagates upon the formation of sharp crack tips. Such a behaviour could be applied in
the construction of the sacriﬁcial part of safety devices, where a complete material failure
is required once a speciﬁc force threshold is reached.
3.3. Enzyme Immobilisation
Enzyme membrane reactors (EMRs) are becoming increasingly important for ap-
plication in bioconversion processes in food processing, pharmaceutics and bioreﬁnery
industries and in wastewater treatment. The major advantage of the EMRs is that they can
achieve simultaneous enzymatic reaction and separation to reduce the production costs.
Among all the different developed conﬁgurations of EMRs, immobilising enzymes directly
in/on the membrane is a particularly important development of EMRs, as these systems
usually display higher stability and reusability [70]. A series of immobilisation methods
has been proposed to ﬁx the enzymes on the membranes. The covalent immobilisation
method usually results in stable enzymatic activities and good recycling reactors. The
Polymers 2021, 13, 1804 13 of 18
principle of the covalent method is to covalently link the enzymes to the membranes
using functional groups that can be present on the membrane or be added by pretreating
the membrane with functionalising reagents. The latter is the most common approach
given the few naturally existing functional groups that can be directly used for covalent
binding in most membranes [ 70]. In the present work, we have developed a covalent
immobilisation strategy exploiting the epoxy groups introduced into PVDF/PCADE 70/30
electrospun ﬁbres. Electrospun membranes have been proposed as suitable materials for
enzyme immobilisation because of easy handling and recovery and high surface-to-volume
ratios [71–73].
We have applied an afﬁnity-driven covalent immobilisation methodology to immo-
bilise ω-transaminase enzyme from Halomonas elongataon these membranes to develop an
EMR with potential use in heterogeneous biocatalysis. Firstly, epoxy groups at the ﬁbre
surface were chemically modiﬁed by iminodiacetic acid (IDA). This procedure did not
affect ﬁbre morphology (Figure S8) and enabled derivatisation of almost half of the epoxy
group at the surface when carried out for 102 h (Supplementary Materials). The enzyme
immobilisation strategy relies on a two-step process—the his-tagged enzyme molecules are
driven by afﬁnity towards Co2+ groups, enabling the solvent-exposed amine groups from
lysine residues to react with nearby epoxy groups of the membrane (Figure 7) [35]. Two
membranes were prepared targeting different degrees of metal-derivatisation by control-
ling the time of incubation with IDA, 2 h and 102 h, respectively, resulting in Co2+-2hIDA-
and Co2+-102hIDA membranes after the metal coordination step. After the chemical treat-
ments the electrospun membrane did not lose its integrity and apparently maintained
its original mechanical properties and good handling. Calculated immobilisation param-
eters of HeWT on both membranes are shown in Table 3. Immobilisation of HeWT on
Co2+-102hIDA membrane was successfully achieved showing a recovered activity value
of 11.8 U gmembrane−1, which is 43.6% of the immobilised activity. The same immobilisa-
tion strategy was previously applied to immobilise HeWT on Sepabeads ®® EC-EP/S, a
polymetracrylate-based porous beads support, yielding 30–40% recovered activity [74,75].
However, the immobilisation yield obtained for the electrospun ﬁbres was lower than
the previously obtained immobilisation yield for polymetracrylate-based porous beads
supports. This might be due to a limitation in the loading capacity of the membrane,
which may display a lower epoxy group density, with respect to the important amount of
enzyme offered (10 mgHeWT gmembrane−1). With respect to the immobilised enzyme only,
43% of the activity was recovered, meaning that a similar distortion of the structure is
expected upon immobilization on the elctrospun ﬁbres compared to the polymetracrylate-
based porous beads supports. A lower degree of metal derivatisation is expected in the
membrane treated with IDA for 2 h. Consequently, the immobilisation yield was lower
in the Co2+-2hIDA- compared to the one obtained in the Co2+-102hIDA membrane. The
immobilisation of HeWT on both membranes is covalent (i.e., amine groups from lysine
residues and other reactive groups of the enzyme have reacted with epoxy groups of the
membrane). This was shown by the fact that after incubating the imm-HeWT membranes
for 1 h at 90 ◦C in liquid solution, no enzyme was observed in the liquid by SDS-page
electrophoresis (data not shown), meaning that no enzyme subunit was detached from the
membrane, and indicating that HeWT subunits were covalently bound to the membrane.
Therefore, the method developed in this work for enzyme immobilisation on membranes
has huge potential in the ﬁeld of EMR and moves forward the use of this type of reactor in
heterogeneous biocatalysis and other applications.
