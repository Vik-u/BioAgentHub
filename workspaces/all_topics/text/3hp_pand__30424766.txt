Abstract 
Background: Economical production of value-added chemicals from renewable biomass is a promising path to 
sustainability. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important chemical for building a bio-sustainable society. Estab-
lishment of 3-HP production from renewable resources such as glucose would provide a bio-sustainable alternative to 
the production of acrylic acid from fossil resources.
Results: Here, we describe metabolic engineering of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to enhance 3-HP 
production from glucose and cellobiose via the malonyl-CoA pathway. The mcr gene, encoding the malonyl-CoA 
reductase of Chloroflexus aurantiacus, was dissected into two functionally distinct fragments, and the activities of the 
encoded protein were balanced. To increase the cellular supply of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, we introduced genes 
encoding endogenous aldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase from Salmonella enterica, and endogenous 
pantothenate kinase. The resulting strain produced 3-HP at 1.0 g/L from a culture starting at a glucose concentration 
of 50 g/L. We also engineered the sugar supply by displaying beta-glucosidase (BGL) on the yeast cell surface. When 
grown on 50 g/L cellobiose, the beta-glucosidase-displaying strain consumed cellobiose efficiently and produced 
3-HP at 3.5 g/L. Under fed-batch conditions starting from cellobiose, this strain produced 3-HP at up to 11.4 g/L, 
corresponding to a yield of 11.2% (g-3-HP/g-glucose; given that 1 g cellobiose corresponds to 1.1 g glucose upon 
digestion).
Conclusions: In this study, we constructed a series of S. pombe strains that produced 3-HP via the malonyl-CoA path-
way. Our study also demonstrated that BGL display using cellobiose and/or cello-oligosaccharides as a carbon source 
has the potential to improve the titer and yield of malonyl-CoA- and acetyl-CoA-derived compounds.

Background
3-Hydoroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a platform 
chemical that serves as a precursor to various valu -
able chemicals, including acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, 
and 1,3-propanediol. Acrylic acid, which is used as a 
super absorbent polymer and in plastic manufacturing, 
currently is produced primarily by catalytic oxidation 
of petroleum-derived propane. Acrylonitrile, a com
-
pound that is produced at more than 14 billion pounds 
per year, is used to generate plastics, resins, and fib
-
ers [1 ]. Hence, the US Department of Energy has des -
ignated 3-HP as one of the most important substances 
that should be targeted for production from renewable 
resources [2 ]. Establishment of 3-HP production from 
renewable resources such as glucose would provide a 
bio-sustainable alternative to the production of acrylic 
acid from fossil resources.
Microbial bioproduction is one of the best solutions for 
building a sustainable economy. Four pathways (includ
-
ing those employing glycerol, lactate, malonyl-CoA, or 
β-alanine) have been defined for the production of 3-HP 
in  vivo using microorganisms. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Lactobacillus reutei are known to produce 3-HP 
from glycerol [3]. The mechanism of 3-HP production 
from glycerol consists of 2 steps. First, glycerol is con
-
verted to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) via a reac -
tion catalyzed by a coenzyme vitamin B12-dependent 
glycerol dehydratase. Next, 3-HPA is converted to 3-HP 
via a reaction catalyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenase [4–
7]. This route is not suitable for industrial use, because 
typical host production microorganisms [notably, E. coli 
and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)] cannot 
synthesize vitamin B12; such host organisms therefore 
would require a continuous exogenous supply of this 
cofactor [3, 8]. The 3-HP production pathway from lactic 
acid is thermodynamically unfavorable [9]. Additionally, 
this reaction yields a mixture of lactate and 3-HP , a com
-
bination that is not suitable for industrial use [9]. Both 
the malonyl-CoA and the β-alanine pathways for 3-HP 
synthesis employ thermodynamically favorable reactions 
that do not require coenzyme vitamin B12, making these 
pathways appealing for industrial use [10–13]. Notably, 
the NADPH-dependent malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) 
from Chloroflexus aurantiacus is widely used for 3-HP 
synthesis. Although MCR catalyzes a two-step reaction 
of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP via malonate semialdehyde [14], 
the imbalance of this cascade causes the accumulation of 
malonate semialdehyde, resulting in a low rate of conver
-
sion from malonyl-CoA to 3-HP . Separation of the MCR 
enzyme into two individual fragments [MCR-C (amino 
acids 550-1219) and MCR-N (amino acids 1-549)] has 
been shown to facilitate the rebalancing of the activities 
of MCR-C and MCR-N, yielding a drastic increase in 
3-HP production (3.72  g/L in shaking flask cultivation) 
when expressed in E. coli [15].
Using acid-tolerant host cells is one of the most impor
-
tant techniques for making 3-HP production an eco -
nomical process. A bacterial host such as E. coli or K. 
pneumoniae need pH control during fermentation, and 
recovery of the desired product subsequently requires 
acidification of the culture. Acid-tolerant hosts, such as 
yeasts, have the advantage that the acid form of 3-HP can 
be produced directly [11]. Notably, budding yeast has 
been engineered for 3-HP production [16]. However, the 
growth of S. cerevisiae is severely impaired in the pres
-
ence of 50  g/L 3-HP [16]. Alternatively, Schizosaccharo -
myces pombe is naturally tolerant to 3-HP and can grow 
even in the presence of 50 g/L 3-HP [16]. However, there 
are only a few reports of 3-HP production using S. pombe 
as a host [13].
Improvement of precursor supply is necessary for 
chemical production. Acetyl-CoA is a precursor of 
3-HP and of a wide range of bioproducts, including iso
-
prenoids, fatty acids and lipids, and butanol. Several 
strategies have been reported for enhancing the level of 
acetyl-CoA in the yeast cytosol, including introduction of 
a PDH bypass [10, 18], blocking the glyoxylate pathway 
to decrease acetyl-CoA consumption [19], and enhancing 
the supply of CoA [20]. In addition, supplying of other 
key metabolites for bioproduct production can be used to 
optimize the cultivation process. For instance, the Iriana 
and Nielsen groups successfully demonstrated 3-HP pro
-
duction using S. cerevisiae as a host with defined medium 
or feed-in-time medium [11]. This feed-in-time medium 
provides carbon-limited cultivation, possibly because 
the medium contains high levels of polysaccharides in 
combination with cellulolytic enzymes, which gradually 
degrade the polysaccharide and release glucose [11]. The 
titer of 3-HP on feed-in-time medium was high; how
-
ever, this S. cerevisiae medium has to be specially synthe -
sized and so is not readily available. In contrast, we have 
developed cell surface-display techniques for this pur
-
pose [21–23]. One of our constructs consists of a beta-
glucosidase (BGL)-displaying S. pombe strain; this strain 
degrades cellobiose and provides glucose as a carbon 
source, permitting direct growth on cellobiose without 
the need for enzymatic supplementation [23]. However, 
there are no reports (to our knowledge) of the produc
-
tion of acetyl-CoA- and malonyl-CoA-derived chemicals 
using BGL-displaying S. pombe.
The present study aimed to improve the 3-HP produc
-
tivity of an engineered S. pombe strain via introduction 
of a malonyl-CoA pathway. To construct such a 3-HP-
producing S. pombe strain, we used three strategies: (a) 
balancing the activity between MCR-C and MCR-N, (b) 
engineering the supply of acetyl-CoA and CoA itself by

metabolic engineering, and (c) engineering the supply 
of sugar by cell surface engineering (Fig.  1). Our results 
demonstrate the potential of S. pombe for 3-HP produc -
tion, showing the potential of cello-oligosaccharides as a 
raw material for 3-HP production.
Materials and methods
Strains and media
All strains used in this study are listed in Table  1. S. 
pombe FY12804 (NBRP) was used as the parental strain. 
Yeast strains were cultivated in YM medium (BD Diag
-
nostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) or EMM medium 
(ForMedium, Norfolk, United Kingdom) supplemented 
with glucose or cellobiose as a carbon source.
Plasmid and homologous recombination (HR) donor 
construction
Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table  1, and 
primers are listed in Additional file  1: Table S1. Cas9 and 
gRNA expression plasmid pMZ374 [24] was purchased 
from Addgene. A 20-base seed sequence together with 
the NGG PAM sequence (N20NGG) in the S. pombe 
genome was selected using CRISPR direct (http://crisp 
r.dbcls .jp/) [25]. The HR donor sequences used as editing 
templates were designed to have about 500-bp homol
-
ogy arms to either side (upstream and downstream) 
flanking the Cas9 cutting site and the sites of the intended 
insertions.
A Cas9 expression plasmid targeting the protease-
encoding aap gene (bp 1-1266) was constructed using 
the KOD-Plus-mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO, Co., Ltd., 
Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instruc
-
tions. pMZ374 was used as a template with the primer 
pair F-aap1-1266 + R-aap1-1266. The resultant plasmid 
was named pMZ374-aap1-1266. Other plasmids for Cas9 
targeting were constructed in a similar way and are sum
-
marized in Table 1.
To construct the MCR expression cassette, the MCR-
encoding gene from Chloroflexus aurantiacus was 
amplified by PCR using codon-optimized synthetic oligo
-
nucleotide (Invitrogen) as a template with the primer pair 
For-MCR + Rev-MCR. The PCR product was cloned into 
the NheI and Sal I sites of pDUAL-FFH1 (RIKEN BRC), 
and the resultant plasmid was named pDUAL-FFH1-
MCR. Other plasmids for expression of mcr-c*, acc, acs 
from Salmonella enterica (acsSE*), atd1, and ptk1 were 
constructed similarly; these plasmids are summarized 
in Table  1. The PCR templates for fragments encod
-
ing mcr-c* and acs from S. enterica were obtained as 
codon-optimized synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen). 
The PCR products encoding acc, acsSE*, atd1, and ptk1 
were cloned (separately) into pDUAL-FFH-31(RIKEN 
BRC); the PCR product encoding mcr-c* was cloned into 
pDUAL-FFH-61(RIKEN BRC). The PCR product encod
-
ing mcr-n was cloned between the Nco I and XhoI sites of 
pDUAL-hsp-SPBC359.04c_BGL [17]. The resulting plas -
mid carries mcr-N under the control of the hsp  promoter 
[17].
To construct HR donor DNA for introduction of the 
acc expression cassette into the chromosomal isp6 region, 
the acc expression cassette (Pcam-acc-Tadh1) was ampli-
fied by PCR with the primer pair For-isp6-1069-3 + Rev-
isp6-1069-4. Upstream and downstream regions were 
amplified with the primer pairs For-isp6-1069-1 + Rev-
isp6-1069-2 and For-isp6-1069-5 + Rev-isp6-1069-6, 
respectively. The three amplified fragments were conju
-
gated by overlap extension PCR with the primer pair For-
isp6-1069-1 + Rev-isp6-1069-6, resulting in HR donor 
DNA for introduction of the acc expression cassette into 
the chromosomal isp6 region. Other HR donor DNAs for 
introduction of fragments encoding mcr-c*, mcr-n, acc, 
acsSE*, atd1, ptk1, and bgl into the respective genomic 
regions were constructed similarly; these plasmids are 
summarized in Table 1.
Genome editing
All mutagenesis experiments were carried out by co-
transformation of 10 µL of the pMZ374 vector series with 
20 μL of the respective PCR product being used as the 
Fig. 1 Engineered metabolic pathway for 3-HP production by S. 
pombe. Two genes (adh8 and adh SPBC337,11) were disrupted; 
the expression of three endogenous genes (atd1, acc, ptk1) was 
enhanced; and four exogenous genes (acsSE* from Salmonella 
enterica, separate fragments encoding MCR-C* and MCR-N from 
Chloroflexus aurantiacus, and BGL from Aspergillus aculeatus) were 
introduced

HR donor DNA for the target locus, as described in a 
previous report [17]. Briefly, strains were grown in 5 mL 
of YM medium at 30  °C with shaking at 180  rpm until 
the culture reached an optical density (OD) at 600  nm 
of 0.5; cells then were co-transformed by electropora
-
tion using a Gene Pulser Xcell II (Bio-Rad) and stand -
ard methodologies. Transformants were selected using 
EMM+Leu plate, then screened by colony PCR and 
DNA sequencing.
Cultivation and analytical methods
For 3-HP fermentation from glucose or cellobiose, 
strains were pre-cultured in 5  mL YM medium for 
3 days at 30 °C with shaking in a 15-mL test tube, then 
washed twice with 1% NaCl and diluted to an ini
-
tial OD of 3.0 in 5  mL EMM medium supplemented 
with appropriate amino acids and containing glucose 
(50 g/L) or cellobiose (50 g/L or 20 g/L). The resulting 
cultures were incubated at 30  °C with shaking, under 
aerobic conditions, with sampling at the indicated 
time points. Cell growth, glucose, and cellobiose lev
-
els were analyzed as described previously (Ozaki et al. 
[17]). 3-HP and acetic acid levels were analyzed using 
an HPLC equipped with a SCR-102H column (7  µm, 
8.0  mm ID × 300  mm; Shimadzu) as described previ
-
ously [17].

were as described above.
Results and discussion
Reconstruction of a pathway for 3‑HP synthesis 
via malonyl‑CoA by coexpression of MCR‑C* and MCR‑N
To develop a S. pombe strain capable of malonyl-CoA-
mediated production of 3-HP , we introduced two genes: 
C. aurantiacus mcr, which encodes malonyl-CoA reduc
-
tase (MCR); and the endogenous acc (cut6) gene, which 
encodes acetyl-CoA/biotin carboxylase. MCR converts 
malonyl-CoA to 3-HP via malonate semialdehyde. ACC 
has a critical role in both malonyl-CoA supply and fatty 
acid biosynthesis. Earlier work suggested that strains 
deficient for intracellular proteases may exhibit improved 
protein expression [26, 27], a property that might also 
enhance 3-HP production. In the present work, mcr was 
introduced by complementation of a Leu- auxotrophy 
with a leu marker and cut6 (expressed under the control 
of ef1a-c constitutive promoter) was introduced by gene 
replacement at the protease-encoding isp  locus. After a 
48-h cultivation in EMM medium supplemented with 
50 g/L glucose, a wild-type S. pombe strain did not pro
-
duce 3-HP to a detectable level, whereas the mcr acc 
strain (designated SPO-01) generated 3-HP to a titer of 
0.016 g/L (Fig. 1a).
The C. aurantiacus MCR is a bi-functional enzyme 
that catalyzes a two-step reduction from malonyl-CoA 
to 3-HP . This enzyme can be separated into two frag
-
ments, MCR-C and MCR-N (i.e., the C- and N-terminal 
subdomains). The MCR-C fragment reduces malonyl-
CoA to malonate semialdehyde, while the MCR-N frag
-
ment reduces malonate semialdehyde to 3-HP [15]. The 
activities of MCR-C and MCR-N are unbalanced, such 
that malonyl-CoA reduction by MCR-C is the rate-lim
-
iting aspect of the two-step reaction [15]. In E. coli, this 
imbalance was minimized by increasing the expression 
ratio of MCR-C/MCR-N after saturation mutagenesis of 
MCR-C, yielding a mutant enzyme referred to here as 
MCR-C*. To recreate the example from E. coli, we intro
-
duced both fragments [one encoding MCR-N (mcrN) and 
the second encoding MCR-C* (mcrC*)] into the genome 
of ACC-expressing S. pombe. The resultant strain gener
-
ated 3-HP to a titer of 0.18 g/L, which was improved com-
pared to SPO-01 (data not shown). We then introduced 
an additional copy of mcrC*. The resultant strain (SPO-
02) harbors 2 copies of mcrC* under the control of ef1a-
c promoter, 1 copy of mcrN under the control of the hsp  
promoter, and 1 copy of acc under the control of the cam1 
constitutive promoter. SPO-02 generated 3-HP to a titer 
of 0.53 g/L (Fig.  2a), a 30-fold improvement compared to 
SPO-01. Both strains consumed almost all of the supplied 
glucose after 24 h, producing 0.5 g/L of acetic acid as a by-
product. Introduction of the mcrN and mcrC* fragments 
did not adversely affect cell growth (Fig.  2d). Introduc
-
tion of a third copy of mcrC* into SPO-02 did not further 
enhance 3-HP production (data not shown), suggesting 
that further improvement of 3-HP titer would require the 
malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA supply.

Improvement of 3‑HP production by increasing the supply 
of acetyl‑CoA
To increase the malonyl-CoA supply, we sought to 
enhance the acetyl-CoA supply. Notably, engineering of 
the availability of acetyl-CoA has been reported to yield 
a positive effect on 3-HP production, presumably via the 
increase in the supply of malonyl-CoA. This strategy has 
been employed successfully in S. cerevisiae to improve the 
production of 3-HP [11, 28], butanol [29, 30], and isopre
-
noids [31, 32]. Specifically, these laboratories enhanced 
the flux towards acetyl-CoA by co-expression of a Sal -
monella enterica gene encoding acetyl-CoA synthase 
harboring a point mutation (referred to here as acsSE*) 
and a gene encoding an intact aldehyde dehydrogenase 
(S. cerevisiae ald6). To apply this approach in S. pombe, 
we introduced acsSE* (under the control of the cam1  
promoter) into the protease-encoding atg4 locus of strain 
SPO-02. We then introduced a copy of the endogenous 
atd1 gene (a S. pombe homolog of the S. cerevisiae ald6 
aldehyde dehydrogenase; also under the control of the 
cam1 promoter) into the adh4 locus (which encodes an 
alcohol dehydrogenase) of the resulting strain. We chose 
to target an alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene based 
on the observation that the loss of alcohol dehydrogenase 
activity permits accumulation of acetoaldehyde, a sub
-
strate of aldehyde dehydrogenase. However, given a pre -
vious report [17] that disruption of the major S. pombe 
alcohol dehydrogenase locus adh1 significantly impaired 
growth, we chose to target the adh4 locus, which encodes 
a minor alcohol dehydrogenase.
The resulting SPO-03 strain (which harbors acsSE* and 
atd1) did not exhibit an improved 3-HP titer (compared 
to strain SPO-02) (Fig.  3a). However, SPO-03 accumu
-
lated acetate to 2.4 g/L after 48 h of cultivation (Fig.  3b). 
Introduction of additional copies of acsSE* or of the 
endogenous acs gene (acs1) could not yield improved 
3-HP production (data not shown).
Engineering the CoA supply is an alternative to for 
improving the acetyl-CoA supply. Pantothenate kinase 
(PTK) is a key enzyme for improving CoA produc
-
tion [33]. For example, the overexpression of mpanK1b 
(encoding a mouse PTK homolog) yielded a 13-fold 
increase of the intracellular CoA concentration in mam
-
malian cells [34]. Similarly, a fivefold increase of acetyl-
CoA levels (with tenfold higher CoA production) was 
obtained by overexpression of the endogenous PTK in 
E. coli [35]. In S. cerevisiae, overexpression of the endog
-
enous PTK in combination with the introduction of acs 
and ald6 was reported to yield ~3.6-fold increased pro
-
duction of naringenin (a flavonoid) compared to the level 
obtained upon introduction of acs and ald6 alone [20]. 
To implement this strategy, we introduced a copy of the 
endogenous gene encoding pantothenate kinase (ptk1) 
into SPO-03 by leu auxotrophic marker. The resultant 
strain (SPO-04) produced 3-HP of 1.1  g/L in after 48  h 
cultivation (Fig.  3a), a doubling of titer compared to 
SPO-03. These results indicated that improving the CoA 
supply is an effective approach for enhancing the produc
-
tion of malonyl-CoA-derived chemicals. Although intra -
cellular amount of acetyl-CoA could not be detected by 
acetyl-CoA kit (data not shown), acetate accumulation 
at 48  h was increased from 2.4  g/L (SPO-03) to 4.7  g/L 
(SPO-04) (Fig.  3b; yellow) in the new strain. The intro
-
duction of additional copies of ptk1 did not further 
improve 3-HP production (data not shown), suggesting 
that acetyl-CoA is sufficient in strain SPO-04.
Improvement of 3‑HP production by controlling 
the carbon supply
Avoiding ethanol accumulation is a challenge for 3-HP 
production in budding yeast. Disruption of the etha -
nol synthesis pathway is a straightforward approach, 
but halts growth. Alternatively, 3-HP production under 
carbon-limited cultivation has been demonstrated in S. 
cerevisiae using feed-in-time medium, which imitates 
a fed-batch process [12]. This feed-in-time medium

contains polysaccharides as well as a degrading enzyme, 
providing a gradual release of glucose. Here, we utilized 
our previously described cell surface-display technique 
for producing BGL on the surface of S. pombe [23]. BGL 
was expressed as a genetic fusion with an anchor protein, 
SPBC359.04c [23]. The resulting BGL localizes to the cell 
surface, where the enzyme hydrolyzes cellobiose into 
glucose. Therefore, we introduced the gene encoding the 
BGL-anchor fusion protein into SPO-04. The resultant 
strain (SPO-05) produced 3-HP at 1.0 g/L starting from 
50 g/L of glucose (Fig.  4a), a titer similar to that obtained 
with SPO-04. That is the expression of BGL had no 
adverse effect on 3-HP production. When 50 g/L of cel
-
lobiose was used as a carbon source, the BGL-displaying 
SPO-05 strain produced 3-HP at 1.6 g/L after 48 h of cul
-
tivation, a titer was 1.5-fold that obtained with glucose. 
These results showed that providing cellobiose (or the 
cello-oligosaccharide form) as the carbon source permits 
an on-going release of glucose by gradual degradation via 
the cell surface-displayed BGL, and cell surface display 
was effective for 3-HP production. During growth on glu
-
cose, strain SPO-05 consumed 45.3  g/L of glucose after 
20 h; almost all glucose was consumed by 24 h. After 20 h 
of cultivation on cellobiose, cellobiose and glucose were 
14  g/L and 7.7  g/L (respectively) in the medium, corre
-
sponding to the consumption of 28.3  g/L of cellobiose. 
The residual amounts of cellobiose and glucose after 24 h 
of cultivation were 7.2 g/L and 6.0 g/L, respectively. Thus, 
SPO-05 cultivated in cellobiose-containing medium 
appeared to maintain a culture medium glucose concen
-
tration of approximately 6–7 g/L. Cell growth on cellobi -
ose was slightly slower than that on glucose, presumably 
due to slower glucose supply. Acetate accumulation was 
notably decreased (from 4.2 to 2.8 g/L after 48 h) when 
cellobiose was used as the carbon source. Maintaining a 
lower glucose concentration in the culture medium by 
use of BGL display may prevent overflow metabolism, 
resulting in reducing acetate accumulation [36].
In an attempt to further improve 3-HP production, 
we introduced additional copies of acc and acsSE* into 
SPO-05. The resultant strain (SPO-06) produced 3-HP 
at 1.8  g/L of after 48  h of cultivation, a slight improve
-
ment compared to SPO-05. Although SPO-06 exhibited 
decreased acetate accumulation (1.6 g/L in 48 h cultiva
-
tion), 3-HP production was not improved. This obser -
vation suggested that an improved malonyl-CoA supply 
was failed to enhance 3-HP production. Therefore, fur
-
ther improvement of MCR activity is desirable.
Re‑tuning of MCR‑C expression level
MCR activity was improved in the SPO-02 strain, and 
the acetyl-CoA supply then was further strengthened 
in the SPO-04 strain. By employing cellobiose as a car
-
bon source with BGL display, 3-HP titer was augmented 
to 1.8 g/L in the strain SPO-05. Further enhancement of 
the flux toward acetyl-CoA decreased acetate accumula
-
tion, and the resultant strain SPO-06 exhibited a slightly 
improved 3-HP titer. Remarkably, SPO-06 exhibited a 
significantly strengthened malonyl-CoA supply com
-
pared to that in SPO-02. Hence, we anticipated that the 
further augment of MCR activity (to utilize the increased 
malonyl-CoA supply) might further enhance 3-HP pro
-
duction. Hence, additional copies of the mcrC* gene were 
inserted into the chromosomal sxa2 locus of SPO-06. It 
is difficult to evaluate the activities of mcrC and mcrN 
because both enzymes use NADPH as a cofactor. How
-
ever, enzyme expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE 
(Additional file  1: Figure S1A) and qPCR analysis of 
the resulting strain (SPO-07) revealed that the relative 
mRNA expression level of mcrC* increased with gene 
copy number (Additional file  1: Figure S1B). Figure  5 
shows that SPO-07, which carries 3 copies of mcrC* in its 
genome, produced 2.0 g/L of 3-HP from 50 g/L glucose

after 48 h of cultivation, a titer twofold higher than that 
obtained with SPO-05 (1.0  g/L of 3-HP from 50  g/L of 
glucose). When cellobiose (50 g/L) was used as the car
-
bon source, SPO-07 produced 3-HP at 3.5 g/L after 48 h 
of cultivation, a titer twofold higher than that obtained 
with SPO-06 (as described above). This level corre
-
sponded to a yield of 0.063 g-3-HP/g-glucose (given that 
50 g cellobiose corresponds to 55.5 g glucose upon diges
-
tion). Introduction of a 4-copies of mcr-C* or 2-copies of 
mcr-N did not further increase the 3-HP titer (data not 
shown).
Fed‑batch cultivation using cellobiose as a carbon source
Production of 3-HP under aerobic fed-batch conditions 
with the limited feeding of cellobiose was evaluated. Spe
-
cifically, EMM medium supplemented with cellobiose 
as a carbon source was used. After 24  h of cultivation, 
when almost all of the original cellobiose was exhausted, 
further cellobiose feeding was initiated. Under these con
-
ditions, strain SPO-07 produced 11.2 ± 0.6  g/L of 3-HP 
(Fig. 6a) after 96 h of cultivation, corresponding to a yield 
of 0.12 ± 0.007  g-3-HP/g-glucose. The volumetric pro -
duction rate in the fed-batch phase was 0.14 g/L/h, cor -
responding to a specific yield of 1.22 g/g-dry cell weight 
(DCW). Low levels of acetate and glycerol accumulated 
under fed-batch culture conditions (Fig.  6b). Glucose 
concentration increased gradually from the start of feed
-
ing, and virtually all of the remaining residual glucose 
was consumed after feeding was stopped (after 65  h). 
Notably, the results reported here [titer 11.2 ± 0.6  g/L, 
yield 12 ± 0.7% (g-3-HP/g-glucose; 1  g cellobiose is 
equivalent to 1.1 g glucose)] are superior to those previ
-
ously reported for malonyl-CoA-dependent 3-HP pro -
duction using S. cerevisiae. When glucose was used as a 
carbon source, 3-HP production under fed-batch condi
-
tions was also evaluated. After 24 h cultivation, when all 
of the original (20  g/L) glucose was consumed, further 
glucose (200  g/L of glucose in feeding medium) feeding 
was started. Strain SPO-07 also produced 9.2 ± 0.9  g/L 
of 3-HP (Fig.  6c) after 96 h of cultivation, corresponding 
to a yield of 11 ± 0. 11  g-3-HP/g-glucose. Similarly, low 
levels of acetate and glycerol accumulated under fed-
batch culture conditions (Fig.  6d). During feeding phase, 
ethanol production was kept at low level in spite of glu
-
cose accumulation (Fig.  6c, d). Enhancement of glucose 
uptake may be one of the ways for improving 3-HP titer, 
as well as shutoff by-products producing pathways. To 
our knowledge, this work is the first report of chemical 
production using beta-glucosidase-displaying fission 
yeast cells under fed-batch condition with cellobiose or 
glucose feeding.
Conclusions
In this study, we constructed a series of S. pombe strains 
that produced 3-HP via the malonyl-CoA pathway. 3-HP 
production was significantly improved through combi
-
natorial strategies including coordination of the expres -
sion of MCR-N and MCR-C, overexpression of the 
acetyl-CoA synthetic pathway, and enhancement of the 
CoA synthesis pathway. The additional incorporation of 
BGL display and the use of cellobiose as a carbon source 
improved 3-HP titer to 11.2 ± 0.6  g/L, corresponding to 
a yield of 12 ± 0.07% (g-3-HP/g-glucose; 1 g cellobiose is 
equivalent to 1.1  g glucose) using fed-batch cultivation 
with cellobiose feeding. These results were superior to 
the peak 3-HP production previously reported in bud
-
ding yeast using the malonyl-CoA pathway. Our study

also demonstrated that BGL display using cellobiose 
and/or cello-oligosaccharides as a carbon source has the 
potential to improve the titer and yield of malonyl-CoA- 
and acetyl-CoA-derived compounds.
