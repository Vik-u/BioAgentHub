ABSTRACT
We have engineered strain BG-10 of the methylotrophic yeastKomagataella phafﬁi for use as an effective whole
cell biocatalyst. We introduced into the yeast a transgene encoding aChromobacterium violaceumω-transaminase
for transcription in response to methanol induction. The strain was then assessed with respect to its growth
performance and biotransformation of a fed ketoalcohol substrate to an amino-alcohol. In the resultant strain, BG-
TAM, methanol induction did not compromise cell growth. Successful bioconversion of fed substrates to the by-
product, acetophenone, indicated transaminase activity in shakeﬂask-cultivated BG-TAM cells. We then used
bioreactor cultivation to exploit the high levels of biomass achievable byKomagataella phafﬁi. In a 900
μL reaction
the BG-TAM strain at OD600 ¼ 1024 achieved up to 0.41 mol mol/C0 1 (molproduct molsubstrate
/C0 1 ) yield on substrate (Yp/
s) for production of 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine and a space time yield (STY) of 0.29 g L/C0 1 h/C0 1 for production
of 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol. We have shown that transamination, an important step for bespoke synthesis of
small molecule medicines, is biologically realisable using enzymes with a broad substrate range, such as
ω-transaminases, within living yeast cells that are fed low-cost substrates for bioconversion.
1. Introduction
The unicellular methylotrophic yeastKomagataella phafﬁi (K. phafﬁi),
formerly known asPichia pastoris(Kurtzman, 2009), is a well-established
platform for heterologous protein production ( Byrne, 2015 ; Mac-
auley-Patrick et al., 2005). The initial genome sequence ofK. phafﬁi (De
Schutter et al., 2009; Küberl et al., 2011) has been further reﬁned and
annotated (Sturmberger et al., 2016), supporting the development of
genetic tools for its manipulation (Ahmad et al., 2014; Vogl et al., 2016).
K. phafﬁi can grow to very high cell densities, exceeding 150 g L/C0 1 of dry
cell weight, using inexpensive and simple media and carbon sources.
Abad et al. (2010)demonstrated the effectiveness ofK. phafﬁi as a whole
cell biocatalyst by showing that cells engineered to expressTrigonopsis
variabilis D-amino acid oxidase could be used effectively for D-amino acid
oxidation. Wei et al. (2018)engineered K. phafﬁi strain GS115 to over-
express a native transketolase and in whole cell biocatalysis the resultant
strain achieved high yields of the chiral sugar L-erythrulose from pro-
chiral substrates.Bea et al. (2010)showed thatK. phafﬁi cells engineered
to express anω-transaminase from Vibrio ﬂuvialis strain JS17 achieved
kinetic resolution of racemicα-methylbenzylamine mixture to an enan-
tiomeric excess of 99% (R)-α-methylbenzylamine.
The ω-transaminase designated CV 2025 (Kaulmann et al., 2007)
from Chromobacterium violaceum (C. violaceum) has shown promising
results in the production of chiral amino-alcohols, such as 2-amino-1,3,
4-butanetriol (ABT), using bacterial whole cells (Ingram et al., 2007;
Rios-Solis et al., 2015). ABT is a key synthon in the production of many
small molecule drugs (Ager et al., 1996; Sehl et al., 2015), including
protease inhibitors (Kwon and Ko, 2002) and antiretrovirals (Raghavan
et al., 2010 ). Bioconversion using ω-transaminases, either puri ﬁed
(Heintz et al., 2017) or within whole cells (Shin and Kim, 1999; Slabu
et al., 2017; Gomm and O'Reilly, 2018) has also been used for production
of chiral amines, another class of synthon utilised extensively in synthesis
of bioactive natural products, agrochemicals and active pharmaceutical
ingredients (Kelly et al., 2018).
In this work, we engineered theK. phafﬁi strain BG-10, available
commercially from ATUM, to overexpress the bacterial transaminase

CV2025 in the new strain, designated BG-TAM. We established the
growth performance of the BG-TAM strain and tested its whole-cell
biocatalytic production of both the chiral amino alcohol ABT, and the
chiral amine 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine (MPPA), when fed low-cost
substrates.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strains and reagents
Komagataella phafﬁi strain BG-10 and plasmid pJ902-15 were pur-
chased from ATUM.K. phafﬁi biomass concentration was measured as
optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer. The
C. violaceum CV2025 ω-transaminase gene (NCBI sequence reference
WP_011135573.1) was obtained from GenScript. Zeocin was purchased
from Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc.
2.2. Construction of the K. phafﬁi BG-TAM strain harbouring the CV2025
transaminase gene
The C. violaceumCV2025 gene was codon-optimised for expression in
K. phafﬁi using the OptimumGene™ algorithm by GenScript. The opti-
mised coding sequence is available as a public data set (Braun-Galleani
et al., 2018). The 1.4 kb CV2025 gene wasﬂanked byBsaI sites enabling
subcloning into a loneBsaI site present in pJ902-15 to generate the new,
4.9 kb plasmid, pJ-CV2025. BG-10 cells were transformed using 20μgo f
SacI-linearised pJ-CV2025 by electroporation (1500 V, 200Ω,2 5μF) and
subsequently plated onto YPD agar plates supplemented with 1 M sor-
bitol and 200–1000 μgm L/C0 1 of zeocin to select for stable integrants.
Colony PCR was used to conﬁrm the presence of integrated pJ-
CV2025 in the AOX1 locus in zeocin-resistant colonies using the
primer, CCAAAGACGAAAGGTTGAATG, which was designed to anneal
within the AOX1 promoter and the primer, GATAATTCGACAA-
CAGCAGG, designed to anneal within the codon-optimisedC. violaceum
CV2025 gene at a position predicted to be 300 base pairs downstream of
the AOX1 promoter only in transformants. Transformant colonies, which
were both zeocin resistant and positive by colony PCR, were designated
‘BG-TAM’ and a master cell bank of clones was generated and cry-
opreserved at -80
/C14 C.
2.3. Shake ﬂask cultivation of K. phafﬁi
K. phafﬁi BG-10 and BG-TAM strains were grown for 18 h in 250 mL
bafﬂed ﬂasks at 30/C14 C with 250 rpm to an OD600 ~ 10 in 50 mL of BMGY
medium (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, 100 mM pH 6.0 po-
tassium phosphate buffer, 0.4μgm L/C0 1 biotin, 1% v/v glycerol and 1.34%
v/v yeast nitrogen base), a base medium for preparation of minimal and
synthetic deﬁned yeast media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5,000 rpm and 4/C14 C for 5 min, washed in phosphate buffer and resus-
pended in 50 mL BMMY medium (same constituents as BMGY but
substituting 1% v/v glycerol for 2% v/v methanol) to an OD600 ¼ 5. 2%
v/v methanol was added every 24 h to maintain induction of theAOX1
promoter. Samples were harvested after 48 h of induction and used for
bioconversion measurements.
2.4. Bioreactor cultivation of K. phafﬁi
Cultivation in bioreactor was performed using a Multifors 1L device
(INFORS HT). The Multifors 1L device has been reported previously to
achieve OD600 in the range of 800–1000 and DCW of 150–200 g L/C0 1
during K. phafﬁi cultivationby Templar et al. (2016)and Wei et al. (2018)
respectively. For a starter culture, 150 mL BMGY in a 1 L bafﬂed ﬂask was
inoculated with a 1.5 mL cryostock, and incubated at 30/C14 C and 250 rpm,
until an OD600 ¼ 60 was reached. This was used as inoculum for 600 mL
of basal salt medium (BSM: 1 L with RO water with 26.7 mL 85% w/v
H2PO4, 0.93 g CaSO4, 18.2 g K2SO4, 14.9 g MgSO4⋅7H2O, 4.13 g KOH, 40
g glycerol and 12 mL of‘Pichia Trace Metal 1’ (PTM1) solution. PTM1
had the following constituents: 6.0 g L/C0 1 CuSO4⋅5H2O, 0.08 g L/C0 1 Nal,
3.0 g L/C0 1 MnSO4⋅H2O, 0.2 g L/C0 1 Na2MoO4⋅2H2O, 0.02 g L/C0 1 H3BO3, 0.5 g
L/C0 1 CoCl2, 20.0 g L/C0 1 ZnCl2, 65.0 g L/C0 1 FeSO4⋅7H2O, 0.2 g L/C0 1 biotin and
5.0 mL L/C0 1 of 96% v/v H2SO4. Cultivation parameters and methanol
induction conditions followed Invitrogen guidelines forPichia fermen-
tation (Invitrogen, 2002) with cultivation conditions of 30/C14 C, pH 5.0 and
dissolved oxygen kept above 20% by increasing agitation speed or pure
oxygen sparging. Brieﬂy, cultivation was performed in batch mode for
~18 h, until glycerol was completely consumed, and subsequently
switched to a glycerol fed-batch regime (50% w/v glycerol feed con-
taining 12 mL L/C0 1 PTM1 trace salts, 18.15 mL h/C0 1 L/C0 1 initial fermenta-
tion volume) for 6 h, followed by a methanol fed-batch phase using 100%
methanol supplemented with 12 mL L/C0 1 PTM1 trace salts at the following
feed rates: 3.6 mL h/C0 1 L/C0 1 for 1 h (M1), 7.3 mL h/C0 1 L/C0 1 for 2 h (M2), and
ﬁnal feed rate of 10.9 mL h/C0 1 L/C0 1, which was maintained for 48 h.
Samples for growth rate monitoring were harvested at t¼ 0 and t¼ end
of each feeding phase. The measurement of dry cell weight was carried
out by putting the cell pellet of 1 mL of culture in an oven (100/C14 C) and
measuring weight in an analytical balance every 24 h until constant (~96
h). Samples for bioconversions were harvested after the initial batch
stage and every 24 h after methanol induction, the supernatant removed
and the cell pellet stored at -20/C14 C.
2.5. Bioconversion reactions
All bioconversion reactions were carried out in 900μL ﬁnal volume
using whole cells at 30/C14 C and 500 rpm in a thermomixer (Eppendorf
ThermoMixer® C). Pelleted shake ﬂask and bioreactor samples were
thawed and re-suspended to 600μL in a pH 7.5 solution of 0.2 mM
pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in 200 mM, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piper-
azineethanesulfonate (HEPES) buffer to allow the PLP cofactor to asso-
ciate with transaminase within cells. These cell suspensions were then
incubated in 1.5 mL glass vials for 20 m, followed by the addition of 300
μL of substrate solution, consisting of 200 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 0.2
mM pyridoxal phosphate and substrate levels needed to provide theﬁnal
concentrations indicated in the Results section. Aliquots of 100μL were
taken from the bioconversion reactions at different time points, centri-
fuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 m at 4 /C14 C, before the supernatant was
removed, retained and stored at -20/C14 C for further analysis.
2.6. Measuring substrates and products
An integrated Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC systemﬁtted with an ACE
5 C18 reverse phase column (150 mm/C2 4.6 mm, 5μm particle size)
controlled by Chromeleon 7 software (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) was used
to quantify MBA, ACP, PB, MPPA and ABT. Samples were quenched and
diluted with 0.1% v/v TFA prior to analysis. To analyse MBA and ACP,
two mobile phases were used: 100% acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% (v/v)
triﬂuoroacetic acid (B). A gradient was run from 15% A/85% B to 72%
A/28% B over 9 min, followed by a re-equilibration step for 2 m (oven
temperature 30/C14 C, ﬂow rate 1 mL/min). UV detection was carried out at
260 nm, with detection times of 3.6 m for MBA, and 7.8 m for ACP.
For MPPA and PB analysis, two mobile phases were used: 0.1% (v/v)
triﬂuoroacetic acid (C) and 0.095% triﬂuoroacetic acid/80% acetonitrile
in MilliQ water (D). A gradient of 40% C/60% D to 100% D was run over
15 min, followed by 2.5 m wash with 100% D, and a subsequent re-
equilibration step for 2.5 m (oven temperature 30/C14 C, ﬂow rate 1 mL/
min). UV detection was carried out at 254 nm, with retention times of 2.7
m for MPPA, and 7.7 m for PB.
For ABT measurement, 6-aminoquinolyl-n-hydroxysuccinimidyl
carbamate (AQC) was used as derivatization agent. AQC, provided by
Dr Fabiana Subrizi from UCL Department of Chemistry, was solubilized
in dry acetonitrile (10 mg mL/C0 1) and stored in dry conditions for no
longer than 2 weeks. Typically, a volume of 75μL of AQC solution was
added to 150μL of bioconversion supernatant previously diluted in 0.02

M borate buffer pH 8.8, reaching aﬁnal volume of 225 uL. This mixture
was centrifuged prior to analysis. To analyse ABT, two mobile phases
were used: 140 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.05 (E) and 100% acetonitrile
(F). A gradient of 85% E/15% F to 100% F over 10 m (ﬂow rate 0.5 mL
min/C0 1), followed by a 2.5 m wash with 40% E/60% F and a 2.5 m wash
with 100% E (ﬂow rate 1 mL min/C0 1). A re-equilibration step was run for 5
min. UV detection was carried out at 254 nm, with a retention time of 6.1
min. For quantiﬁcation of ERY, an Aminex HPX-87H reverse phase col-
umn (300/C2 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad, USA) was used. The system was run at 60
/C14 C with 0.6 mL min/C0 1 isocratic ﬂow of 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid as mobile
phase. UV Detection was carried out at 210 nm with a retention time of
11.5 min. The molar extinction coefﬁcient (ε) at wavelength of 260 nm
was determined to be 4878.05 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for MBA and 4405.29 M/C0 1
cm/C0 1 for ACP. At 254 nmε was determined to be 171.32 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for
PB, 168.86 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for MPPA and 2890.17 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for derivatised
ABT.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Growth and methanol tolerance of BG-TAM strain unchanged from
parental strain
We tested whether transaminase overexpression impacted the growth
characteristics of K. phafﬁi strain BG-TAM, given that endogenous
transaminases form part of the native metabolic networks of the organ-
ism. BG-TAM and BG-10 strains were each cultivated in the presence of
up to 5% v/v methanol. The BG-TAM growth proﬁle (Fig. 1a) did not
deviate markedly from that of the parental strain BG-10 (Fig. 1b). The
highest concentration of 5% v/v methanol suppressed growth in both
strains, whereas 2% v/v provided the best results for cell density and
growth rate. This methanol concentration was used subsequently for
induction in the shakeﬂask experiments of this study.
3.2. Indication of whole cell transaminase activity in BG-TAM cells
cultivated in shakeﬂasks
BG-10 and BG-TAM cells were cultivated in shakeﬂasks in the pres-
ence of 2% v/v methanol for 48 h. Harvested cells were diluted or
concentrated to a normalised concentration of OD600 ¼ 39, for purposes
of comparison, and incubated with substrates to assess whole cell bio-
catalytic activity for production of ABT and MPPA by the pathways
illustrated inFig. 2a and b, respectively. When cells of the BG-TAM were
incubated with 10 mM MBA and 30 mM ERY, production of ACP was
observed, whereas under the same conditions cells of the parental BG-10
strain resulted in no ACP production (Fig. 2c). We interpreted this
observation as further evidence that the plasmid pJ-CV2025 had inte-
grated at the AOX1 locus as intended and that expression of the codon-
optimised CV2025 gene was responsible for the observed ACP accumu-
lation. Shakeﬂask-cultivated BG-TAM cells were prepared as above for
bioconversion of MBA and ERY to ABT and also for bioconversion of MBA
and PB to MPPA. Both bioconversions showed activity, with production
of around 4mM product for both ABT (Fig. 2d) and MPPA (Fig. 2e).
Fig. 3. Bioreactor cultivation of BG-TAM to high cell density. Engineered BG-TAM and parental BG-10 strains were cultivated in parallel using a Multifors 1 L
bioreactor system. A standard Invitrogen fermentation protocol was used in which an initial glycerol batch phase was applied until 18.5 h post-inoculation, followed
by glycerol fed-batch growth until approximately 26 h post-inoculation. From 26.5 h post-inoculation onward methanol fed-batch growth was applied.

3.3. Cultivation of BG-TAM strain to high cell density in a 1L bioreactor
BG-TAM and parental BG-10 strain cells were cultivated in a 1L
bioreactor comprising ﬁrstly a glycerol batch and fed-batch feeding to
achieve high biomass, followed by fed-batch methanol feeding to induce
the AOX1 promoter that controls expression of the transgene. Under this
cultivation regime, the unmodiﬁed parental BG-10 strain and the engi-
neered BG-TAM strain achieved cell densities of OD600 ~ 900–1000, after
48 h of methanol induction. The growth proﬁle illustrated inFig. 3shows
cell biomass accumulation data from three cultivations performed in
parallel using the Multifors 1L bioreactor system. Growth of the engi-
neered BG-TAM strain was comparable to that of the unmodiﬁed strain,
with matching levels ofﬁnal biomass achieved at harvest. Given that the
strains also showed similar growth performance during shake ﬂask
cultivation (Fig. 1), under methanol induction, we concluded that over-
expression of the CV20205 transaminase gene in BG-TAM did not
considerably perturb viability of the BG-TAM strain relative to the
parental strain.
3.4. High density whole cell bioconversion as a function of substrate
concentration
Bioreactor-cultivated BG-TAM cells were harvested after 66 h of
methanol induction (92.5 h post inoculation) when an OD600 ¼ 1024 was
achieved (ﬁnal time point,Fig. 3). We then mapped the limits of substrate
concentration that high cell density suspensions of BG-TAM cells could
tolerate whilst maintaining bioconversion. We measured bioconversion
achieved by cells incubated with 10–30 mM substrate, the concentrations
we had used for shakeﬂask samples, and then increased substrate con-
centration to 100 mM andﬁnally to 0.5 M (Fig. 4).
A concentration of 0.5 M MBA and ERY abolished production of both
ACP (Fig. 4a) and ABT (Fig. 4b), establishing an upper limit on the
performance of the whole cells for this reaction. By contrast, the whole
cell biocatalyst retained a level of activity in 0.5 M substrates PB and
MBA, producing 2.82 mM MPPA. We concluded from these observations
that the upper limit for substrate tolerance for the ABT reaction is not due
solely to general stress of the enzyme or living cells but is in part
substrate-speciﬁc. At a concentration of 100 mM, all substrates were
well-tolerated and resulted in the highest observed bioconversion levels
of 11.48 mM for ABT, and 29.6 mM for MPPA (Fig. 4). The data inFig. 4
suggest future investigations would be warranted to map biocatalysis
performance for substrate concentrations between 0.1 M and 0.5 M.
4. Conclusions
Schrewe et al. (2013)proposed a battery of performance measures

(OD600 ¼ 1024) and biocatalytic performance measured as a function of substrate concentration. Graphs show bioconversion of the fed substrate pair MBA/ERY to
ACP (a, black circles) and ABT (b, black squares) and bioconversion of MBA/PB to MPPA (c, triangles– black and grey to indicate different cell densities and substrate
concentrations used in the reaction).

best suited to whole cell biocatalysts, which could be useful for re-
searchers or industrialists across a range of different process conﬁgu-
rations and needs. InTable 1 we collated the performance metrics for
BG-10 strain whole cells used in the three best-performing conditions,
with respect to product concentration, observed in Fig. 4. Table 1
shows that BG-10 whole cells achieved a best yield on substrate (Yp/s)
of 0.41 mol mol/C0 1 (molproduct molsubstrate
/C0 1 ), which is comparable to the
Yp/s of 0.52 mol mol/C0 1 reported by Wei et al. (2018)for whole cell
biocatalysis using a K. phafﬁi strain engineered to overexpress trans-
ketolase, an enzyme type that typically exhibits high activity in bio-
conversions. As ω-transaminases have been shown to be responsive to
mutational approaches to increase their performance (Deszcz et al.,
2015), the performance data reported here with an unmodi ﬁed
ω-transaminase certainly encourages further investigation of whole cell
applications.
