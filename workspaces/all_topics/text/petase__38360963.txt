Biotechnological plastic recyclinghas emerged as a suitable option for
addressing the pollution crisis. A major breakthrough in the biodegradation of
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is achieved by using a LCC variant, which
permits 90% conversion at an industrial level. Despite the achievements, its
applications have been hampered by the remaining 10% of nonbiodegradable
PET. Herein, we address current challenges by employing a computational
strategy to engineer a hydrolase from the bacterium HR29. The redesigned
variant, TurboPETase, outperforms other well-known PET hydrolases. Nearly
complete depolymerization is accomplished in 8 h at a solids loading of
200 g kg
−1. Kinetic and structural analysis suggest that the improved perfor-
mance may be attributed to a moreﬂexible PET-binding groove that facilitates
the targeting of more speciﬁc attack sites. Collectively, our results constitute a
signiﬁcant advance in understanding and engineering of industrially applic-
able polyester hydrolases, and provideguidance for further efforts on other
polymer types.
Substantial efforts have been dedicated to discovering and engineer-
ing PET hydrolases over the past two decades, contributing to the
development of PET biodegradation from the detection of trace
amounts of released products to the attainment of high conversion
1– 12.
When combating the challenges posed by enzymatic PET recycling,
key parameters should be taken into consideration to attain an eco-
nomically viable industrial process, in particular solids loading
(> 150 g kg
−1) and product yield (> 90%)13– 15. However, almost all studies
obtain appreciable depolymerization yields at solids loadings lower
than 30 g kg
−1, which is considerably below an industrially relevant
level15. When increasing the solids loading to a high level, a reduction in
the hydrolysis rate and conversion is commonly observed (referred to
as “solids effect”), as demonstrated in other heterogeneous reactions
such as the biomass conversion process
16.
A breakthrough was achieved with an engineered LCC variant
(LCCICCG) that exhibited 90% depolymerization of pretreated PET waste
at an industrially relevant solids loading (200 g kg−1)17.H o w e v e r ,t h e
10% nonbiodegradable PET remained and reached a high crystallinity
level of ~30% because of physical aging, hindering immediate reuse for
PET depolymerization. A report issued by the National Association for
PET Container Resources indicated that the postconsumer PET bottles
collected for recycling reached 800 kilotons in the US
11, and this would
generate over 80 kilotons of nonbiodegradable PET waste per year if
the current biodegradation strategy was employed, posing a sig-
niﬁcant threat to the PET recycling economy. Increasing the extent of
conversion from 90% to 99% would cut the minimum selling price
(MSP) of TPA by 10% (US$0.2/kg) according to the TEA model pro-
posed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US; thus,
second to solids loading, the conversion level is the largest factor
affecting MSP in the depolymerization process
14. Both environmental
and socioeconomic concerns have fueled intense interest in improving
the degradation level to accelerate the transition towards the circular

Results
Computational redesign of an efﬁcient PET hydrolase
PET hydrolases belong to serine-hydrolase family, a widely distributed
group known for their relatively low substrate speciﬁcity. The degra-
dation function of PET hydrolases is thought to preexist as a pro-
miscuous function, which then evolves into a primary function
28,29.
Given our limited knowledge of how a sequence encodes catalytic
functions in polymer-degrading enzymes
30, addressing the challenge
by exploiting physics-based computational redesign and rational
design approaches is a difﬁcult task. Alternatively, a successful
approach involves utilizing deep learning models to map the process
from protein sequence to function, as demonstrated in many cases
31– 33.
These models can capture hidden information indicating the
improvement in polymer degradation along the evolution trajectory
from the relativeﬁtness of protein variants. To this end, we employed a
language model trained on two datasets that involved approximately
26,000 homologous sequences of PET hydrolases across evolution, to
predict the probability of amino acid variation from the evolutionary
landscape (Fig.1A). To select the template enzyme, we compared the
activity of LCC, LCC
ICCG, BhrPETase, FastPETase, and HotPETase using
amorphous PETﬁlms (Gf-PET, from the supplier Goodfellow) across a
range of temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 2). BhrPETase shares a high
sequence identity of 94% with LCC, whereas LCC
ICCG represents a var-
iant of LCC characterized by four amino acid substituents (F243I/
D238C/S283C/Y127G). Both FastPETase and HotPETase are derivatives
engineered fromIsPETase (Supplementary Fig. 3). At 65 °C, BhrPETase
and LCCICCG exhibited the highest catalytic performance of all PET
hydrolases and temperatures tested and were chosen as the inputs. A
Transformer encoder was used to process input amino acid sequences
with absolute position embedding. Residue positions were sorted by
the mean of the logits of 19 mutations assigned to the wild type amino
acid at each position. The top ten amino acid positions with the highest
average scores of each model were selected. After duplicated amino
acid positions were removed, 18 amino acid positions at which the
wild-type residues ﬁt less well than potential substitutions were
obtained (Supplementary Table 1).
According to the crystal structures of BhrPETase (PDB code:
7EOA)a n dL C C
ICCG S165A in complex with MHET (PDB code:7VVE34), 7
of the 18 generated amino acid positions (W104, H164, M166, W190,
H191, H218, and F/I243) were suggested to be embedded in a PET-
binding groove. Due to the relatively higher thermostability of
BhrPETase, we subjected the 7 positions on this enzyme to generate 34
variants. Chen et al. reported that the Ser214/Ile218 double mutants of
several IsPETase-homologous enzymes showed enhanced PET hydro-
lysis activity (by at least 1.3-fold) but vastly decreasedT
m values
(by approximately 10 °C)35. Since His218 (corresponding to Ser214
in IsPETase) was involved in our predicted candidates, the hydrolytic
performance of the H218S/F222I variant was also explored (Supple-
mentary Table 2). Among the variants, BhrPETase
H218S/F222I (referred to
as BhrPETase M2) resulted in the highest improvements with a 1.7-fold
increase in PET-hydrolytic activity at 65 °C, rendering this variant the
new template for the second-round accumulation of the mutations at
the remaining 6 positions. During the 2nd accumulation stage, only
mutations at W104 and F243 positions (W104L, W104S, W104H,
W104G, F243I, F243T, and F243G) on M2 exhibited improved hydro-
lytic activities (by 10% to 34%), albeit with signiﬁcant decrease in
thermostability (Supplementary Table 3).
Empirical data have suggested that aT
m 15 °C higher than theTopt
is necessary for catalyst longevity27. Hence, a PET hydrolase with aTm
at least over 80 °C is preferred for efﬁcient PET degradation. Notably,
the M2 variant exhibited a melting temperature of 85 °C, which was
11 °C lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The active mutations at
the W104 positions on M2 reduced the stability even further, withT
m
values ranging from 71.5 °C to 75.5 °C. The nonnegligible decrease in
stability limited further combination, and compensatory mutations
needed to be introducedﬁrst to suppress the deleterious effects.
Therefore, we applied our previously devised GRAPE strategy
36,w h i c h
employs four complementary algorithms, namely, FoldX37 (force ﬁeld
energy function), Rosetta_cartesian_ddg38 (forceﬁeld energy function),
ABACUS39 (statistical energy function) and DDD40 (force ﬁeld energy
function), to design stabilizing mutations to compensate and buffer
the destabilizing mutations (Fig.1B). Upon experimental validation, 3
beneﬁcial variants (A209R, D238K, and A251C-A281C) resulted in
improved thermostability without compromising the activity (Sup-
plementary Table 4). We added the stabilizing variants to the M2 var-
iant using a stepwise combining strategy and resulted in a BhrPETase
M6 variant (BhrPETase
H218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C), which exhibited a
restored melting temperature of 97 °C without sacriﬁcing activity.
Subsequently, active mutations at the W104 and F243 positions were
combinatorically assembled and accumulated onto the thermostable
M6 variant, generating 12 new variants (Fig.1C and Supplementary
Table 5). After a consideration of both depolymerization performance
and thermostability, the best combination variant, BhrPETase
H218S/F222I/
A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T(referred to as TurboPETase), was selected
with aTm of 84 °C and a 3.4-fold improvement in PET-speciﬁc activity
towards GF-PETﬁlms compared to wild-type BhrPETase (Fig.1D). In
industrial scenarios, enzymatic hydrolysis is typically conducted in
water rather than in a dedicated buffered system to simplify down-
stream processing. Aligned with the industrial preferences, we also
evaluated the 12 variants under a low buffer concentration. The results
revealed that with the exception M6
W104G/F243T, all variants largely
retained their degrading activity in 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6). TurboPE-
Tase consistently outperformed the other variants under both low and
high buffer concentrations, making it the most effective variant for
further investigation.
The depolymerization performance of TurboPETase was subse-
quently evaluated across a temperature range of 50– 65 °C with respect
to other PET hydrolases (Fig.2A, B, and Supplementary Fig. 5). At 65 °C,
TurboPETase exhibited the highest overall degradation of all PET
hydrolases and temperatures tested, releasing 29.66 mM of the pro-
ducts (sum of BHET, MHET, and TPA) in 3 h. Counterparts like

lytic activity 1.8-, 4.7-, 2.1-, 2.0-, and 19-fold lower than that of Turbo-
PETase, respectively. At suboptimal temperatures, TurboPETase

consistently outperformed other PET hydrolases, albeit the decreased
hydrolytic activity. At the optimal temperature of HotPETase and
CaPETaseM9 of 60 °C, TurboPETase generated 11.73 mM monomer
products in 3 h, whereas HotPETase and CaPETaseM9 produced
4.32 mM and 0.60 mM monomers, which were 1.7-, and 18-fold lower
than that of TurboPETase. When subjected to 50 °C, TurboPETase
registered hydrolytic efﬁciencies exceeding those of FastPETase and
DepoPETase by 43% and 59%, respectively. In light of the lower enzyme
concentrations employed in certain reports, we recalibrated our
reactions to mirror these conditions to ensure a fairer comparison
(Fig. 2C– E). Under their reported reaction conditions, the reaction
rates of LCC
ICCG, HotPETase, and FastPETase were 1.8-, 4.9-, and 1.0-fold
lower, respectively, than that of TurboPETase. Recently, similar
experiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation perfor-
mance of FastPETase, HotPETase, PES-H1L92F/Q94Y and LCCICCG under
industrial conditions41. Their results demonstrated that HotPETase
exhibited a higher speciﬁc activity compared to PES-H1L92F/Q94Y at a low
substrate loading of 2 g L−1. However, as the substrate concentrations
increased to 16.5% (w/w) and 20% (w/w), the PET conversion of Hot-
PETase were signiﬁcantly lower than those of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y.T h i s
reduced efﬁciency at higher substrate loadings is suggested to be
attributed to the limited thermostability and other catalytic properties
of HotPETase, such as product inhibition. Despite the good perfor-
mance of PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y under industrially relevant conditions, theﬁnal
depolymerization was still lower than that achieved by LCCICCG.G i v e n
the reported enhancements of PES-H1L92F/Q94Y in 1 M potassium phos-
phate buffer, we also compared TurboPETase with PES-H1L92F/Q94Y
under elevated buffer concentration, with TurboPETase still out-
pacing, yielding up to 2.5 times the degradation products of PES-H1
L92F/
Q94Y at 65 °C (Supplementary Fig. 6). To evaluate the long-time stability
of TurboPETase, we extended the reaction time. The results demon-
strated continuous enzyme performance of TurboPETase at elevated
temperatures, as it produced 130 mM of soluble monomer products
over 12 h at 65 °C, whereas the released products with BhrPETase, LCC,
LCC
ICCG were substantially lower (Supplementary Fig. 7). The degra-
dation results highlight the substantially superior hydrolytic

mutations at the remaining 6 positions to M2 led to active variants with dramati-
cally decreased stability, and therefore, the GRAPE strategy was employed. The
stabilizing mutations were combined into M2 and resulted in the thermostable
variant M6, which can compensate for the destabilizing mutations in further
accumulation steps. The active mutations at the W104 and F243 positions were
combinatorically assembled on M6, leading to theﬁnal mutant TurboPETase.

performance of TurboPETase across various temperatures and other
reaction conditions tested.
Michaelis‒Menten approach and structural analysis
To interpret the enhanced hydrolysis performance, the kinetics were
analysed through conventional Michaelis‒Menten model and inverse
Michaelis‒Menten model. As shown in Fig.3A, the curves exhibited
near-linear relationships for the initial rate and substrate loading under
all conditions for TurboPETase, BhrPETase and LCC
ICCG. Conventional
saturation behaviour was not observed because even the lowest
enzyme concentrations used here (0.12μM) were too high for the
conventional approach to be valid, which indicates the very fast rates
of dissociation of the enzymes from the PET surface. Additionally, we
conducted a kinetic comparison for soluble substrates (MHET and
pNPB) as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 7.
The catalytic efﬁciency of TurboPETase towards MHET showed only a
modest enhancement relative to PET (with a 32% increase), suggesting
that there may be other factors, potentially increased adsorption to
the surface, contributing to the ampliﬁed degradation efﬁciency of
PET. Conversely, the slight decrement in TurboPETase’s k
cat for pNPB,
accompanied by a reduced binding afﬁnity, inferred potential changes
in the substrate binding domain, rendering it less conducive for other
small molecule interactions.
Although the hydrolysis of PET could not meet the criteria for the
conventional approach, the inverse Michaelis‒Menten model was
more applicable. The inverse Michaelis‒Menten equation has been
successfully employed to study the kinetics of heterogeneous
enzymes such as cellulases, by which the catalytic efﬁcacy against
accessible attack sites on the polymer surface can be estimated
42– 45.A s
a typical surface erosion process, enzymatic hydrolysis of PET can
hardly permeate the inner core of the polymer, resulting in a limited
number of superﬁcial ester bonds (also termed attack sites) being
accessed even if the enzymes are in great excess. Saturation thus
occurs when all sites on the surface become occupied, and the excess
enzyme molecules accumulate in the solvent
42. It should be noted that
not all adsorption sites are competent for catalytic conversion, non-
speciﬁc adsorption also accounts for a considerable proportion44.W e

saturation, similar maximum adsorption capacities ( Γ

observed, underscoring a consistent overall binding potential across
the enzymes. Comparisons of these enzymes could be expanded by
considering speciﬁc changes in inverse Michaelis‒Menten parameters,
which can reﬂect the binding capability to the attack sites of the PET
surface. As shown in Fig.3Ba n dT a b l e1,t h e
invKM values revealed
marginal differences between TurboPETase, BhrPETase, and LCCICCG,
especially for the values at 30 g kg−1 substrate loading, indicating that
the speciﬁc adsorption capacity of TurboPETase at the attack sites on
the PET surface was not impaired. It’s noteworthy that TurboPETase
exhibited a 2.1-fold increase ininvVmax/massS0 compared with BhrPETase
and LCCICCG. The inverse parameter, maximal reaction velocity per
available reactive site (invVmax/massS0), speciﬁes the rate when all attack
sites are covered with the enzyme42. Since no substantial differences in
invKM and Γmax values were observed among the enzymes, the elevated
invVmax/massS0 values may imply a broadened targeting of TurboPETase
towards speciﬁc attack sites when the enzymes maintained a stable
overall adsorption level. Consequently, we presumed that the
enhanced depolymerization performance of TurboPETase may rely, at
least in part, on the enhanced ability to attack a broader spectrum of
speciﬁc attack sites that can be hydrolysed to form a productive
complex.

An in-depth structural analysis also helps us to understand the
molecular underpinnings of the performance improvements. Accord-
ing to the model of TurboPETase predicted by AlphaFold247 and sub-
sequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the improved
performance of TurboPETase may be attributed to the following key
aspects: improvedﬂexibility of the substrate binding cleft (H218S/
F222I, W104L and F243T), optimized charge-charge interactions at the
protein surface (A209R and D238K), and introduction of a disulﬁde
bond (A251C-A281C). A209R, D238K, and the disulﬁde bond A251C-
A281C are suggested to primarily contribute to improving thermo-
stability while maintaining activity (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11),
whereas the enhanced hydrolysis efﬁcacy may be attributed to sub-
stitutions in proximity to the active sites. H218 is suggested to form an
intimate packing with the conserved W190 in analogous enzymes.
Chen et al. found that PET hydrolytic activity could beneﬁt from a more
ﬂexible active site in the H214S/F218I double mutant (corresponds to
H218S/F222I in BhrPETase)
35. In the present study, MD simulations of
the apo form of TurboPETase revealed an expanded rotational free-
dom of W190 endowed by the H218S/F222I mutation (Supplementary
Fig. 12), which is consistent with the observation of diverse con-
formations of the corresponding W156 ofIsPETase
35.W h e nb i n d i n gt o
the PET, the wobbling of W190 is curtailed and anchored by theπ-π
interactions with the PET substrate. Thisﬂexibility of the PET binding
cleft was further enhanced by the synergistic interactions conferred by
the addition of W104L and F243T, as revealed by the Cα root-mean-
square ﬂuctuation (RMSF) results (Fig.3C). W104 is previously repor-
ted to pack against the adjacent P248 to stabilize the P248-situatedβ8-
α6l o o p34. In the redesigned TurboPETase, the relinquishment of this
interaction by leucine substitution may engender increased con-
formational malleability within the loop region (N246-A250), as
demonstrated by the largely reduced cross-correlation of these
regions (Supplementary Fig. 13). For another substitution F243T in the
PET binding cleft, the steric proﬁle of F243 appears to dictate a more
peripheral binding locus for PET. Yet, its mutation to threonine, armed
with a less pronounced steric feature, may release the space for PET
binding with a more-ﬂexible state. More importantly, without the steric
proﬁle of the aromatic ring, T243 may beckon PET deeper into the
cleft, drawing the substrate’s labile carbonyl closer to the catalytic
serine, with the interstitial distances contracting from 4.88 ± 0.51 Å to
4.15 ± 0.37 Å (Supplementary Fig. 14). Concurrently, the enhanced
ﬂexibility might compromise the protein’s stability, which is consistent
with the observed decrease in the melting temperatures of the single
point mutations. Synthesizing our structural analysis with the kinetic
data, we postulated that the greatly increasedﬂexibility along the PET-
binding groove may provide more space to accommodate a variety of
attack conformations through dynamic binding, which may be crucial
for the formation of catalytically competent complexes on different
surface structures (Fig.3D). Based on the above results, we reasoned
that TurboPETase is probably more promiscuous with respect to the
conformation of the PET strand it attacks. Nevertheless, detailed
analysis of the mechanism requires further efforts through more in-
depth research.
Performance of TurboPETase on alternative substrates and in
dual-enzyme systems
Previous study has demonstrated limited biodegradation efﬁciency of
IsPETase and its variant towards other semiaromatic polyesters, spe-
ciﬁcally PBT, at 37 °C36. Compared to PET, PBT has a lower glass tran-
sition temperature (Tg), which ranges between 37 and 55 °C48.I nt h i s
study, even though 65 °C surpasses theTg of PBT, thus signiﬁcantly
enhancing the mobility of PBT polymer chains, all of the examined
enzymes exhibited substantially reduced degradation ef ﬁciency
towards PBT ﬁlms at 65 °C with respect to the degradation of PET
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Speciﬁcally, TurboPETase yielded higher
amounts of hydrolytic products (62.6μM) than both BhrPETase
(27.5μM) and LCC
ICCG (47.1μM). These results suggested that the
active sites of current PET-degrading enzymes were less efﬁcient in
binding with the extended aliphatic chains in PBT compared to PET.
Consequently, dedicated efforts in enzyme discovery or tailored
engineering are still needed for further improving the depolymeriza-
tion of new classes of semiaromatic polyesters.
Various efforts have been made to develop dual enzyme systems
to remove the intermediate products BHET and MHET
49– 53, which are
known inhibitors of PET hydrolases. Haugwitz et al. reported a dual
enzyme system combining an engineered TfCa mutant and PETase PM
enzyme that yielded a 4-fold increase in overall products towards Gf-
PET ﬁlms compared to PETase PM alone at 45 °C over 24 h

explored the application potential of TurboPETase by coupling it with
the recently reported thermostable BHET hydrolyzing enzyme,
BHETase
54, in a dual-enzyme system. At a low substrate loading
(2 g kg−1), the dual-enzyme system effectively doubled the overall yield
of the products, relative to the singular use of TurboPETase (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16). However, an intriguing observation emerged at an
elevated PET loading of 30 g kg
−1. TurboPETase alone surpassed the
yields from most enzyme ratios in the dual-enzyme system at 65 °C, the
only exception being the 0.5 mg
TurboPETase/gPET:0.1 mgBHETase/gPET
ratio. Nevertheless, in the current investigation, only degradation of
amorphous PET materials at 65 °C were evaluated. Future research
could expand to examine the efﬁcacy of the dual-enzyme system on
different MHET hydrolases and PET substrates with varying physical
properties under diverse reaction conditions, including varied
temperatures.
Nearly complete degradation of postconsumer PET products at
industrially relevant high-solids loading
To better evaluate the depolymerization performance of TurboPETase
at industrially relevant levels of solids loading, we have compared the
depolymerization of pretreated postconsumer coloured-ﬂake PET
(PcPET) wastes with TurboPETase and LCC
ICCG at a substrate loading of
200 g kg−1. TurboPETase achieved nearly complete depolymerization
(98.2%, calculated from the HPLC data) of PcPET wastes in 8 h (Fig.4A),
with a maximum production rate of 61.3 ghydrolyzed PETL−1 h−1 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). A slight change in
the crystallinity of PcPET was observed (reaching 11.9% after 8 h),
which allows an immediate reuse of the remaining PcPET waste for
depolymerization. In contrast, LCC
ICCG required 16 h to reach 97.7%
depolymerization (calculated from the HPLC data) at 65 °C, and the
remaining PcPET exhibited a similar crystallinity of 11.1%, demon-
strating that the“physical aging” process was suppressed at lower
temperatures. At the previously reported optimal reaction tempera-
ture of 72 °C, LCC
ICCG reached its maximal conversion of 92.5% (cal-
culated from the HPLC data) over 12 h, and no further increase was
obtained after prolonged reaction time due to the higher deform-
ability of PET chains. The remaining PcPET showed a high level of

crystallinity, estimated at 32.5%, which is in accordance with a previous
report17.
Many factors can affect enzymatic attack against the plastics: e.g.,
crystallinity, chain mobility, molecular size, surface topography and
hydrophobicity
11. Among these, the role of low crystallinity in PET
degradation has been extensively studied. A crystallinity exceeding
20% has been previously proposed to signiﬁcantly impede the enzy-
matic degradation process. In the depolymerization of non-melt-
quenched PET powders (27.6% crystallinity), we found a signiﬁcant
reduction in degradation performance (Supplementary Fig. 18 and
Supplementary Table 11). However, during the depolymerization of
pretreated PcPET, even when the crystallinity reached 20% after 4 h of
degradation by LCC
ICCG at 72 °C, we did not observe a rapid decline in
degradation rate. Pfaff et al. showed that LCCICCG is more efﬁcient in
hydrolyzing shorter polymers27. Recent studies also demonstrated that
heavily pretreated PET, with a degree of polymerization (DP) less than
20 and high crystallinity, can remain highly degradable
55,56.T h e s e
ﬁndings underscored the importance of factors other than crystallinity
in enzymatic degradation, and promoted further investigation
through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, which
revealed notably low weight-average (M
w) and number-average (Mn)
molecular masses in PcPET powders compared to non-melt-quenched
PET powders (Supplementary Table 12). From the GPC results, we
speculate that the low molecular weight of pretreated PcPET may
contribute to the maintained degradation rate by LCC
ICCG at 72 °C
during theﬁrst several reaction hours, but a further increase in crys-
tallinity to 32.5% led to a substantial reduction in the amorphous
regions, impeding further enzymatic catalysis. Moreover, during the
depolymerization process, we also observed a slight decrease inMw
and moderate changes inMn, despite achieving over 90% depoly-
merization (Fig.4B ) .T h i si sc o n s i s t e n tw i t hp r e v i o u ss t u d i e so nP E T
degradation hydrolyzed by Cut19057. It has been suggested that the
enzymatic hydrolysis of PET typically initiates with an endo-type chain
scission after the enzyme binds to the PET surface. Further hydrolysis
of the neighboring ester bonds within the amorphous regions occurs
through an exo-type chain scission, leading to the release of soluble
products
19. For polymers undergoing random scission, the probability
of exo-scission inversely correlates with chain length53.F o rP E Tw i t ha
DP around 200, the probability for exo-scission is substantially less
than for endo-scission. In this study, the DP of the pretreated PcPET,
approximately 50, is much lower than that of typical raw PET materials.
This resulted in a signiﬁcantly increased number of chain ends avail-
able for exo-scissions. Consequently, endo-type scission, which would
reduce the DP of PET, no longer held a dominant proportion, which
may potentially explain the minimal changes in molecular size
observed during the PET depolymerization process.
To explore the industrial viability, we scaled up the reaction
and performed it in a 7.5 L bioreactor with a PET loading of 200 g kg
−1
in water solution at pH 8.0. Enzyme loading is of particular concern to
the industry since enzyme cost is among the essential factors in
the biomass depolymerization process. In contrast to using high

mately 57% depolymerization achieved, and followed by a slower phase
from 2 to 8 h. According to the kinetic parameters obtained from Fig.3,
we suggested that the reduced reaction rate may be attributed to the
substantial decrease in PET loading at high conversion levels. Despite
the decreased hydrolytic efﬁciency, the approximately 98% depoly-
merization (98.9% calculated from the HPLC data, 98.4% calculated from
the consumed NaOH and 97.4% calculated from the weight loss, as listed
in Supplementary Table 10) achieved within 8 h during the scaled-up
reaction makes pilot-scale production feasible. Further process reﬁne-
ment could potentially optimize the depolymerization efﬁciency for
lower concentrations of PET waste.
Discussion
Biocatalytic PET depolymerization offers a sustainable and energy-
efﬁcient approach to PET recycling, presenting a more environmen-
tally friendly alternative to current disposal methods such as landﬁlls
and incineration. While signiﬁc a n tp r o g r e s sh a sb e e nm a d et ot h i se n d ,
the ultimate goal is to develop enzymes and processes suitable for
industrial-scale applications. Both high substrate solids content and
conversion beneﬁt the economics of PET biodegradation, as it reduces
both capital and operational expenditures. However, the material
slurry exhibits a high apparent viscosity due to the high solids loading,
leading to limited mass and heat transfer, which reduces the efﬁciency
of enzymes in the early stages of hydrolysis. More importantly,
increasing the solids loading to industrially relevant levels would lower
the depolymerization yield due to the inhibition by high product
concentrations
16. Hence, mere thermostability of the enzyme may not
sufﬁce for industrial PET degradation. Multiple factors interplay,
inﬂuencing enzyme efﬁcacy in real-world scenarios. An aspect often
overlooked by the scientiﬁc community is the variance in hetero-
geneous enzymatic hydrolysis between laboratory experiments and
industrial production. For instance, the depolymerization activity of
PET can be enhanced in the laboratory by fusion with noncatalytic
binding modules to increase the enzyme concentration on the PET
surface. However, this advantage is completely lost at an industrial
solids loading level
15. Despite recent advancements in engineering PET
hydrolases to improve their performance in PET depolymerization,
efforts are still needed in the quest of new PET hydrolases to address
conversion loss under industrially relevant conditions.
Here, we employed a hybrid computational strategy to redesign a
PET hydrolase that signiﬁcantly outperforms other well-known PET
hydrolases. Nearly full degradation of postconsumer PET bottles was
achieved at an industrially relevant level of solids loading, rendering
this highly efﬁcient, optimized enzyme a good candidate for future
applications in industrial plastic recycling processes. The mechanism
responsible for enhancing enzyme performance has been demon-
strated via kinetic analyses derived from an inverse Michaelis‒Menten
reaction regime as well as structural analysis, highlighting the impor-
tance of improving the speciﬁc polymer interactions on speciﬁc attack
sites rather than general nonspeciﬁc surface adsorption. The results
may help further knowledge on heterogeneous reaction catalysis and
shall be beneﬁcial for designing industrial viable plastic-degrading
enzymes to address the challenges associated with other more abun-
dant plastics, such as polyurethanes with hydrolysable backbones.
While the potential of enzyme design drives further developments in
the improvement of enzyme performance, it is crucial to assess their
depolymerization efﬁciency under industrially relevant conditions to
demonstrate practical feasibility.
Methods
Training the Transformer model
Unsupervised training datasets. Homologous sequences of BhrPE-
Tase and LCCICCG were searched from Uniclust30 (version 2018_08)
and the BFD database with HHblits (the number of iterations was set as
4, and other parameters were left as default values) using 15 seed
sequences in Pfam family PF01083 as queries. All searched sequences
were clustered at 90% identity using CD-HIT to obtain 10847 sequen-
ces. Since BFD and Uniclust30 were clustered at very low similarity,
they may have been undersampled forﬁtness modelling in very close
regions. Previous work by Frazer et al.
59 sampled MSA built with more
similar proteins to predict disease variants. We also retrieved
15051 sequences belonging to PF01083 from the UniProt database.

model theﬁtness distance of sequences, we trained a neural network
with an encoder-decoder from starch. We used a Transformer encoder
to process input amino acid sequences with absolute position
embedding. Unlike other models such as recurrent and convolutional
networks, the Transformer made no assumption on sequence ordering
and was more powerful at capturing long-distance relationships in
sequence because of the attention mechanism (Eq.1):

We applied multi-head self-attention as described by ref.60.T h e

embedding size of 512. Based on the encoder embeddings, the decoder
generates probabilities of each token. The model was trained with a
masked language modelling objective to predict the real amino acid at
the masked position. In this study, 40% of tokens were replaced with
mask tokens during training. We used the Adam optimizer with a
learning rate set to 3 e
−4. Models were trained for 20 epochs using a
batch size of 32. Residues wereﬁltered by sorting by the logits assigned
to the WT amino acid. The top ten residue positions with the highest
average scores from the prediction of each model were selected. The
average score was calculated using the following equation:

where/C22Lresidue is the average score of the predicted residue position,Lmi
and Lwt are the predicted logits of the single point mutation in the
residue position and the wild-type amino acid, respectively. Excluding
the duplicated positions, a total of 18 residue positions were
generated, among which W104, H164, M166, W190, H191, H218, and
F/I243 were suggested to be located on the PET-binding groove.
Design of stabilizing mutations by the GRAPE strategy
The GRAPE strategy reported in our previous study36 was used to improve
the protein stability. The sequence of BhrPETaseH218S/F222Iwas submitted to
the GRAPE-WEB online server (https://nmdc.cn/grape-web/). Based on
the sequence information of BhrPETaseH218S/F222I, AlphaFold247 was used to
predict the structure model. Subsequently, energy calculations with
FoldX37, Rosetta_cartesian_ddg38, and ABACUS39 were used to predict
stabilizing mutations. The DDD algorithm40 was used to predict the

suitable disulﬁde bonds. The thresholds for ABACUS, FoldX, and Rosetta
were set to -3.0 AEU,−1.5 kcal/mol and−1.5 REU, respectively.
Molecular docking and MD simulations
TurboPETase was modelled by AlphaFold2. Then, the protein was
simulated for 20 ns. The representative structure obtained from the
MD simulations and the crystal structure of BhrPETase (PDB ID:7EOA)
was used for further docking. A model substrate comprising three
consecutive PET units, mimicking the N-terminal and C-terminal
groups to cap the polymer chain at both ends, was generated.
YASARA was employed to make molecular docking of PET to Turbo-
PETase and BhrPETase. The highest binding energy model was selec-
ted. The selected model was subjected to local docking for 999 runs.
The optimized model of TurboPETase-PET and BhrPETase-PET com-
plexes were simulated in AMBER 16
61 using the ff16SB forceﬁeld. The
His242 residue was protonated in the HID state. Cl− ions were added to
maintain system neutrality. The systems were then solvated in a
truncated octahedron box using the TIP3P water model with an 8 Å
distance around the solute. Following solvation, the systems under-
went a 12,000-step minimization and were gradually heated from 0 K
to 338 K with a collision frequency of 1 ps
−1. After equilibration, 100 ns
MD simulations were conducted for each complex, employing a time
step of 2 fs.

puriﬁed enzyme were mixed in a 200 mL bioreactor (Kusnc, Shanghai,
China). A magnetic stirrer was utilized to maintain constant agitation at
300 rpm. The temperature was regulated at 65 °C (or 72 °C for LCC
ICCG)
by water bath immersion, and the pH was regulated at 8.0 by adding
4 M NaOH solution. Assays were performed in triplicate and evaluated
accordingly.
During the reaction, the percentage of PET depolymerization was
evaluated by analysing the supernatant through HPLC. Theﬁnal
depolymerization yield was additionally veriﬁed by investigating the
weight of residual PET. The reaction mixture wasﬁltered through
Whatman grade 1 qualitativeﬁlter papers (GE Healthcare, USA). The
residue was washed twice with deionized water and then dried at 65 °C
overnight. To evaluate the proportion of PET in the residue, 200 mg of
the dried residue was incubated in 20 mL of 4 M NaOH solution at
90 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, the amount of released TPA was measured by
HPLC analysis. The overall weight of the residue solids and the pro-
portion of PET are shown in Supplementary Table 9.
Estimating the depolymerization performance of TurboPETase at a
larger scale. A total of 0.5 kg pretreated PET powder, 1.9 L of deio-
nized water and 0.1 L of TurboPETase solution (containing 1 g of pur-
iﬁed enzyme) were combined in a 7.5 L bioreactor (New Brunswick
Scientiﬁc, Edison, NJ, USA). The stirring rate was maintained at
300 rpm, the temperature was regulated at 65 °C, and the pH was
regulated at 8.0 by adding 4 M NaOH solution. The percentage of PET
depolymerization during the reaction was evaluated according to base
consumption. Additionally, theﬁnal depolymerization yield was ver-
iﬁed by analysing the residue (alkaline hydrolysis and HPLC analysis
methods were identical to the protocol above), which was collected by
centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min), washed twice with deionized
water and dried at 65 °C overnight.
Determination of apparent melting temperatures, PET crystal-
linity and molecular weights
To determine apparent melting temperatures, aﬂuorescence-based
thermal stability assay was employed. A 5µL1 0 0 - f o l dd i l u t e dS Y P R O
Orange dye (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA) was added in a
20 µL protein solution. The mixture was placed in a thin-walled 96-well
PCR plate, sealed with optical-quality sealing tape. The mixture was
heated in a CFX 96 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system
(BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) from 25 to 100 °C at a heating rate of
1.4 °C/min. The crystallinity of PET and PBT was analysed by differ-
ential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The parameters were set following a
previously reported procedure
36. For molecular weight analysis of PET,
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was applied. GPC
measurements were carried out using an Agilent 1260 system (Agilent
1260, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) with a Refractive Index (RI)
detector. The mobile phase consisted of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoro-2-pro-
panol (HFIP), and the analysis was performed at 35 °C with aﬂow rate
of 1 mL/min.
Kinetics analysis
For PET depolymerisation, initial rate measurements were collected
for the
convMM andinvMM datasets. For theconvMM dataset, Gf-PETﬁlms
over a range of 0-50 g kg−1 were treated in 300μLo f1 0 0 m Mp o t a s -
sium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with enzyme loadings of 0.12μM,
0.37μMa n d0 . 7 4μM( 1– 6 μg). For the invMM dataset, 12 g kg−1,
20 g kg−1,a n d3 0gk g−1 Gf-PET ﬁlms were treated in 500μLo f1 0 0m M
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with enzyme loading levels
ranging from 0 to 2.67μM( 0– 36 μg). The reaction mixture was incu-
bated at 65 °C for 1 h. All reactions were performed in triplicate and
terminated by heating to 100 °C for 10 min. The supernatant obtained
by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 5 min) was then analysed by HPLC. The
data wereﬁtted using Matplotlib in python.
For 4-Nitrophenol butyrate (pNPB), all reactions were performed
in 96-well plates in a total reaction volume of 100μL. Theﬁnal con-
centrations of pNPB range from 0.2 to 1.4 mM, and theﬁnal con-
centration of enzymes was 0.5µgm L
−1.1 0μL of the solution ofpNPB
(in anhydrous ethanol), 80μL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 8.0), and 10μL of enzymes were incubated at 65 °C for 3 min.
Then, 100μL of anhydrous ethanol was added to quench the enzy-
matic reactions. Each reaction was conducted in triplicate. Thep-
nitrophenol products were measured at 405 nm using an Inﬁnite® 200
PRO microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). One unit of enzyme
activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to convert
1 μmol of pNPB per min. The data wereﬁtted using Matplotlib in
python.
For MHET, the reactions were performed in a total volume of
250 μL. Theﬁnal concentrations of MHET range from 6 to 60 mM (in
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), and theﬁnal con-
centration of enzymes was 0.1 mg mL
−1. The reactions were conducted
at 65 °C in triplicate for 15 min, then were quenched by adding 250μL
of dimethylsulfoxide. The hydrolysis extent was measured by HPLC.
The data wereﬁtted using Matplotlib in python.
Binding isotherms
Adsorption measurements for TurboPETase, BhrPETase, LCCICCG and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) were conducted in a 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) using low-binding Eppendorf tubes

tained at 65 °C for 1 h equilibration period. Afterward, 100µLo ft h e
supernatant was mixed with 100µLo ff r e s h l yp r e p a r e dB C Aw o r k i n g
solution. This mixture underwent incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, fol-
lowed by absorbance measurements at 562 nm using a plate reader to
determine the concentration of free proteins within the solution. The
quantities of bound proteins werethen deduced by calculating the
difference between the total protein concentrations and the con-
centrations of free proteins.
Determination of free cysteine residues
To identify the free cysteine residues in the solution of TurboPETase,
5,5’-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was used
27.2 5 μLo f
enzyme solution (8μM of BhrPETase or TurboPETase) or L-cysteine
solution (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50μM), 225μLo ff r e s h l yp r e p a r e dD T N B
solution (2 mg/mL DTNB in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH
8.0) and 250μL of EDTA solution (100 mM ethylene diamine tetra-
acetic acid in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) were
mixed thoroughly and incubated for 15 min. Afterward, the absorption
of samples at 412 nm was measured using the spectrophotometer
(MAPADA V– 1100D, Shanghai, China).
