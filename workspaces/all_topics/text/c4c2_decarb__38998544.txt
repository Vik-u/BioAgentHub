Abstract: During malolactic fermentation (MLF) of vinification, the harsh L–malic acid undergoes
transformation into the milder L–lactic acid, and via decarboxylation reactions it is catalyzed by
malolactic enzymes in LAB. The use of bacterial malolactic starter cultures, which usually present
challenges in the industry as the suboptimal conditions after alcoholic fermentation (AF), including
nutrient limitations, low temperatures, acidic pH levels, elevated alcohol, and sulfur dioxide concen-
trations after AF, lead to “stuck” or “sluggish” MLF and spoilage of wines. Saccharomyces uvarum
has interesting oenological properties and provides a stronger aromatic intensity than Saccharomyces
cerevisiae in AF. In the study, the biological pathways of deacidification were constructed inS. uvarum,
which made the S. uvarumcarry out the AF and MLF simultaneously, as different genes encoding
malolactic enzyme (mleS or mleA), malic enzyme (MAE2), and malate permease (melP or MAE1) from
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Lactococcus lactis, Oenococcus oeni, and Lactobacillus plantarumwere heterol-
ogously expressed. For further inquiry, the effect of L–malic acid metabolism on the flavor balance in
wine, the related flavor substances, higher alcohols, and esters production, were detected. Of all the
recombinants, the strains WYm1SN with coexpression of malate permease gene MAE1 from S. pombe
and malolactic enzyme gene mleS from L. lactisand WYm1m2 with coexpression of gene MAE1 and
malate permease gene MAE2 from S. pombecould reduce the L–malic acid contents to about 1 g/L,
and in which the mutant WYm1SN exhibited the best effect on the flavor quality improvement.

1. Introduction
The winemaking process usually involves alcoholic fermentation (AF) performed
by Saccharomyces cerevisiaeor other non-Saccharomyces yeasts and malolactic fermentation
(MLF) driven by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for most red and some white wines [1–3]. Grapes
and certain wines undergoing AF harbor a diverse array of organic acids that exert a
profound influence on the overall quality and flavor profile of the wine. Among these
organic acids, malic acid and tartaric acid collectively constitute a substantial majority,
ranging from 70% to 90%. Tartaric acid is regarded as the main contributor to wine acidity
and was not metabolized by grape berry cells via respiration in the same manner as malic
acid, predominantly existing in the wine matrix as potassium tartrate and potassium
hydrogen tartrate, with only a minor fraction susceptible to conversion into lactic and acetic
acid during MLF. Specifically, the harsh and astringent malic acid exhibits instability and
is susceptible to rapid decomposition by microorganisms, ultimately leading to quality-
related concerns [ 4–8]. It is imperative to conduct the pivotal process of MLF, during
which the tart L–malic acid undergoes transformation into the milder L–lactic acid and
carbon dioxide via a decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by malolactic enzymes in LAB,

enhancing organoleptic balance and bolstering bacteriological stability in the wine. Hence,
the malic acid content serves as a crucial indicator of fermentation completion, with a widely
accepted guideline specifying that wines should have a malic acid content of less than
1 g/L [9,10]. The MLF process, on the other hand, presents challenges in terms of control
due to various suboptimal physicochemical conditions, including nutrient limitations,
low temperatures, acidic pH levels, elevated alcohol, and sulfur dioxide concentrations,
competition with yeast and other bacterial strains, as well as susceptibility to bacteriophage
infections. Additionally, MLF can give rise to undesirable metabolites, such as biogenic
amines and ethyl carbamate by LAB [11–13].
Several approaches including blending, carbonate additions, precipitation, dilution,
and carbonic maceration have been carried out to reduce the acidity of grape must or
wine [14–16]. Saccharomyces are unable to efficiently metabolize malate due to their defi-
ciency in an active malate permease responsible for the transport of extracellular malate [17].
During MLF, LAB facilitate deacidification by catalyzing the conversion of L-malate into
L-lactate and CO2, which is chiefly mediated through malolactic enzyme (MLE) encoding
by the gene mleS or mleA, and the malate transporter encoded by the gene mleP [18,19].
Schizosaccharomyces pombehas also demonstrated significant capability in reducing malic
acid levels. S. pombeconverted L-malate from must into ethanol and CO2, which is facili-
tated by the active transport of L–malic acid into the cells using an H +-symport system,
driven by the activity of the malate permease (MAE1). Subsequently, the cytosolic malic
enzyme (MAE2) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate into pyruvate and
CO2; pyruvate is further metabolized into ethanol and other flavors [ 20,21]. Therefore,
the researchers endeavored to engineer malolactic pathways in S. cerevisiaeby introducing
constitutive expressions of the heterologous malolactic enzyme or malate transporter. Ad-
ditionally, the recombinants exhibited varying degrees of malate decarboxylation during
AF in wine. Bony et al. obtained a malolactic S. cerevisiaethrough the coexpression of
the Sz. pombemalate transport gene (MAE1) and the Lactococcus lactismalolactic enzyme
gene (mleS) under the control of promoter PGK1, leading to efficient decarboxylation 3 g/L
of malate within a 3-day period [ 22]. Volschenk et al. demonstrated that a strain of S.
cerevisiae containing the Sz. pombe malate permease (MAE1) and malic enzyme ( MAE2)
genes integrated in the genome efficiently degraded 5 g/L of L–malic acid in synthetic and
Chenin Blanc grape musts [23]. Husnik et al. constructed a genetically stable industrial
strain of S. cerevisiaeby integrating a linear cassette containing the Sz pombeMAE1 and the
Oenococcus oenimalolactic gene mleA, resulting in fully decarboxylated 5.5 g/L of malate
in Chardonnay grape must during the AF [ 24]. S. uvarumhas been shown to produce a
stronger aromatic intensity than that produced by S. cerevisiae, although the regulatory
mechanism underlying the heterologous genes in S. uvarumremains unclear. Moreover, it
is noteworthy that the expression of the essential genes in S. uvarummetabolizes the malic
acid, but at the same time it is bound to ruin the flavor balance of the wine [25–27].
Higher alcohols are one of the most important groups of aroma compounds that
significantly influence the quality and flavor profiles of wine. Appropriate content and
proportion of higher alcohols will lead to an alcoholic beverage that is mellow, soft, and
plump, which are factors that coordinate the bouquet. An excessive level of higher alcohols
will generate a strong fusel oil flavor, which may also potentially damage health [28,29]. It
has been found that approximately 80% of higher alcohols in wine are generated during
AF, concurrent with the reproduction and fermentation of wine yeasts. Higher alcohols
are converted from α-ketoacids via decarboxylation by α-ketoacid decarboxylase and
reduction of an aldehyde group by alcohol dehydrogenase. α-ketoacids involved can either
be synthesized from pyruvate by the Harris pathway or from degradation of branched-chain
amino acids (BCAAs) via the Ehrlich pathway [30,31]. Thus, it is important to acknowledge
that alterations in malate or pyruvate levels resulting from the expression of essential genes
related to malic acid degradation may also have an impact on the metabolism of higher
alcohols and other related flavors.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathways for degradation of L–malic acid were con-
structed as the heterologous genes from L. lactis, O. oeni, L. plantarum(considered as the
next-generation MLF fermented with the prospect of replacing O. oeni), and S. pombewere
expressed or coexpressed in S. uvarum. Besides physiological characteristics and fermenta-
tion performances, including the growth curve and the content of ethanol, residual sugar,
and organic acid, the higher alcohols and esters concentrations in wine were also detected
to confirm the effect the heterologous gene expressions in S. uvarum.

PGK1 fragment and selection marker KanMX fragment, respectively. Yep352 was used as
the backbone to construct the recombinant plasmids.
The recombinant plasmid Yep-P was constructed as previously reported. The frag-
ments of genes MAE1, MAE2, mleSN, mleAJ, mleSZ amplified from S. uvarum, S. pombe, L.
lactis, O. oeni, and L. plantarumwere cloned into Yep-P digested with XhoI to obtain the
plasmid Yep-PE, Yep-Pm2, Yep-PSN, Yep-PAJ, and Yep-PSZ, respectively. Similarly, the
gene MAE1 from S. pombeand genes mleP from L. lactis, O. oeni, and L. plantarumwere
inserted into Yep-P , constructing the recombinant plasmids Yep-Pm1, Yep-PPN, Yep-PPJ,
and Yep-PPZ, respectively. The fragments PGKp-MAE1-PGKt, PGKp-MAE2-PGKt, PGKp-
mleSN-PGKt, PGKp-mleSZ-PGKt, and PGKp-mleAJ-PGKt were cloned into Yep-PPN at
the SmaI restriction site, obtaining Yep-PPNE, Yep-PPNm2, Yep-PPNSN, Yep-PPNSZ, and
Yep-PPNAJ, respectively, and the fragments PGKp-MAE1-PGKt, PGKp-MAE2-PGKt, PGKp-
mleSN-PGKt, PGKp-mleAJ-PGKt, and PGKp-mleSZ-PGKt were cloned into Yep-Pm1 at
the SmaI restriction site, resulting in Yep-Pm1E, Yep-Pm1m2, Yep-Pm1SN, Yep-Pm1AJ, and
Yep-Pm1SZ. Then, the selection marker KanMX was inserted into the recombinant plasmids

2.3. Transformation Strategy
The transformation process was performed using the lithium acetate/PEG method.
The experiment procedures, including cell culture, preparation, and transformation of
competent cells, were carried out as previously reported [16]. The plasmids Yep-P , Yep-PEK,
Yep-Pm2K, Yep-PSNK, Yep-PSzK, Yep-PAJK, Yep-Pm1K, Yep-PPNK, Yep-PPZK, Yep-PPJK,
Yep-PPNEK, Yep-PPNm2K, Yep-PPNSNK, Yep-PPNSZK, Yep-PPNAJK, Yep-Pm1EK, Yep-
Pm1m2K, Yep-Pm1SNK, Yep-Pm1AJK, and Yep-Pm1SZK were transformed into S. uvarum
WY1, and then the mutant strains WY0, WYE, WYm2, WYSN, WYSZ, WYAJ, WYm1, WYPN,
WYPZ, WYP J, WYP NE, WYPNm2, WYP NSN, WYP NSZ, WYP NAJ, WYm1E, WYm1m2,
WYm1SN, WYm1AJ, and WYm1SZ.
2.4. Fermentation Conditions
The detailed procedures, encompassing grape acquisition, juice adjustment, prepara-
tion of yeast strains, and inoculation ofS. uvarum, closely followed the protocols established
by Li et al. [16]. The must was adjusted to 20.45 Brix and pH 3.4–3.6 by addition of sucrose
and tartaric acid, respectively. A 250 mL autoclaved flask was filled with 190 mL of for-
mulated must. The modified grape juice, following adjustments, underwent fermentation
at 25 ◦C in a temperature-controlled environment. The presence of residual sugar at 0.5%
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 6 of 19
indicated completion of the yeast fermentation process. All fermentations were performed
in triplicate.
2.5. Chemical Analysis
The growth curves of the parental strain and mutant strains were monitored using a
Bioscreen Automated Growth Curves analysis system. The CO2 weight loss was measured
at 12 h intervals using an analytical balance throughout the fermentation process. Following
fermentation, the pH, ethanol concentration, and residual sugar content were determined
using a pH meter, oenometer, and Brix hydrometer, respectively. L–malic acid, L–lactic acid,
and other organic acids were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), while flavor compounds, including higher alcohols, ethyl acetate, and ethyl lactate,
were analyzed via an Agilent 7890C GC (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The detailed experimental
conditions were implemented as reported previously [32]. All analyses were conducted
in triplicate.
2.6. Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
The total RNA of S. uvarumwas extracted using a Yeast RNAiso Kit (Takara Biotech-
nology, Dalian, China), followed by reverse transcription using a PrimeScript™ RT reagent
Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The
abundance of mRNAs encoding the target genes was determined by amplifying the genes
using corresponding cDNAs as PCR templates. Changes in gene expression levels were
evaluated by RT-qPCR employing an SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Tli RNaseH Plus) (Takara
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The expression level of the target genes was normalized
relative to the expression level of UBC6 that served as a reference gene [33]. The results
were quantitatively analyzed using the 2−∆∆Ct method.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Data were represented as the mean ± standard errors. Data analysis was conducted
using Origin 9.0 and SPSS 24.0 statistical software. The differences between the mutant
strains and parental strain were confirmed by Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was
considered at p < 0.05.
3. Results and Discussion
During winemaking, LAB carry out the MLF to convert the harsh malic acid into
supple and stable lactic acid and CO2 catalyzed by the malolactic enzyme (MLE), resulting
in deacidification and improving the organoleptic balance of wine. When using bacterial
malolactic starter cultures, LAB grow poorly and unpredictably in wine, which leads to
“stuck” or “sluggish” MLF and spoilage of wines. Thus, performing both the AF and MLF
with a single wine yeast strain is an absolute requirement for winemaking. In the current
study, recombinantS. uvarumswas transferred into malolactic activity genes to perform the
MLF during AF, as shown in Figure 1. Following the method used for the introduction of a
plasmid carrying a multicopy of regulatory or structural genes after codon optimization to
test the gene regulation at molecular levels, a similar process was carried out to investigate
the potential for S. uvarum[16].

3.1. Effect on L−Malic acid Degradation of Single-Gene Heterologous Expression in S. uvarum 
The malic enzyme encoded by gene MAE1 in S. uvarum and gene MAE2 in S. pombe 
catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and CO 2. The malolactic 
enzyme encoded by gene mleS in L. lactis and L. plantarum, and gene mleA in O. oeni are 
devoted to transform the L −malic acid to L −lactic acid and CO 2 [21,34,35]. Thus, to ex-
plore the potential gene regulation on L −malic acid degradation, the genes were ex-
pressed in S. uvarum, respectively, under the controls of the promoter PGK1, construct-
ing the mutant strains WYE, WYm2, WYSN, WYSZ, and WYAJ. To verify the expression of 
the heterologous genes in the mutants, we quantified their relative expression levels us-
ing RT-qPCR. The results are depicted in Figure 2. The relative expression levels of 
genes mleS, mleA, or MAE2 in the mutants exhibited significant improvements compared 
to those in the parental strain, respectively ( p < 0.05). Consequently, the heterologous 
genes were cloned and expressed accurately in S. uvarum WY1. After AF, the concentra-
tions of L−malic acid, L−lactic acid, and pyruvic acid were detected, the result is shown 
in Figure 3. The L −malic acid content by the mutant strains WYE, WYm2, WYS N, WYAJ, 
and WYSz were 3.148, 2.733, 2.557, 2.504, and 2.4 32 g/L, thus reduced by 10.36%, 22.16%, 
27.18%, 28.68%, and 30.73% compared with that of the parental strain (3.511 g/L, p < 
0.05). And the L −lactic acid production of WYE and WYm2 showed no significant 
changes compared to the wild-type strain, but that of WYSN, WYAJ, and WYSz was 2.665, 
2.684, and 2.793 g/L, which were 16~18-fold higher than that produced by the parental 
strain (0.152 g/L, p < 0.05). In addition, the pyruvic acid production of the engineered 
strains showed no significant difference comp ared with that of the parental strain. This 
discrepancy constitutes a primary factor contributing to the variation in fermentation 
yield of higher alcohols between the mutant strains and the parental counterpart.

the potential gene regulation on L–malic acid degradation, the genes were expressed in S.
uvarum, respectively, under the controls of the promoter PGK1, constructing the mutant
strains WYE, WYm2, WYSN, WYSZ, and WYAJ. To verify the expression of the heterologous
genes in the mutants, we quantified their relative expression levels using RT-qPCR. The
results are depicted in Figure 2. The relative expression levels of genesmleS, mleA, or MAE2
in the mutants exhibited significant improvements compared to those in the parental strain,
respectively (p < 0.05). Consequently, the heterologous genes were cloned and expressed
accurately in S. uvarumWY1. After AF, the concentrations of L–malic acid, L–lactic acid,
and pyruvic acid were detected, the result is shown in Figure 3. The L–malic acid content
by the mutant strains WYE, WYm2, WYSN, WYAJ, and WYSz were 3.148, 2.733, 2.557, 2.504,
and 2.432 g/L, thus reduced by 10.36%, 22.16%, 27.18%, 28.68%, and 30.73% compared
with that of the parental strain (3.511 g/L, p < 0.05). And the L–lactic acid production of
WYE and WYm2 showed no significant changes compared to the wild-type strain, but that
of WYSN, WYAJ, and WYSz was 2.665, 2.684, and 2.793 g/L, which were 16~18-fold higher

acid production of the engineered strains showed no significant difference compared with
that of the parental strain. This discrepancy constitutes a primary factor contributing to
the variation in fermentation yield of higher alcohols between the mutant strains and the

Saccharomyces exhibit limited efficiency in mala te metabolism, attributed to their 
lacking an active malate permease responsible for extracellular malate transport 
[17,36,37]. Malate permease mleP in LAB and MAE1 in S. pombe are the active malate 
transporters from extracellular to intracellu lar compartments [21,38]. Consequently, the 
mleP genes from L. lactis, L. plantarum, and O. oeni, along with the mae1 gene from S. 
pombe, were cloned and expressed in S. uvarum under the regulation of the PGK1 pro-
moter, respectively. The mutants WYP N, WYP Z, WYP J, and WYm1 were obtained. The 
significant improvements observed in the relative expression levels of mleP or MAE1, as 
shown in Figure 1, in the mutants indicate the successful expression of the exogenous 
genes in S. uvarum. As shown in Figure 4,  The L −malic acid contents of the wine fer-
mented by WYP N, WYPZ, WYPJ, and WYm1 were 2.967, 3.145, 3.222, and 2.514 g/L, re-
spectively, indicating a decrease of 15.51%, 10.42%, 8.23%, and 28.41% compared to that 
produced by the parental strain ( p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in the con-
tents of lactic acid and pyruvate produced by both the mutants and the parental strain. 
Additionally, to assess the mutants’ capacity for malate transport between extracellular 
and intracellular compartments, the fermenta tion experiment was conducted by inocu-
lating simulated grape juice. Th e production of intracellular L−malic acid was measured 
as depicted in Figure 5. The intracellular L −malic acid contents in the mutants WYP N, 
WYPZ, WYPJ, and WYm1 were 0.473, 0.362, 0.285, and 0.792 g/L, respectively, indicating 
a significant improvement compared to the pare ntal strain. This demonstrates that the 
heterologous expression of genes encoding ma late permease significantly influences the 
transport of malic acid from extracellular to intracellular compartments in S. uvarum.

Saccharomyces exhibit limited efficiency in malate metabolism, attributed to their lack-
ing an active malate permease responsible for extracellular malate transport [ 17,36,37].
Malate permease mleP in LAB and MAE1 in S. pombeare the active malate transporters
from extracellular to intracellular compartments [21,38]. Consequently, the mleP genes from
L. lactis, L. plantarum, and O. oeni, along with the mae1 gene from S. pombe, were cloned
and expressed in S. uvarumunder the regulation of the PGK1 promoter, respectively. The
mutants WYPN, WYPZ, WYPJ, and WYm1 were obtained. The significant improvements
observed in the relative expression levels of mleP or MAE1, as shown in Figure 1, in the
mutants indicate the successful expression of the exogenous genes in S. uvarum. As shown
in Figure 4, The L–malic acid contents of the wine fermented by WYP N, WYPZ, WYPJ,
and WYm1 were 2.967, 3.145, 3.222, and 2.514 g/L, respectively, indicating a decrease
of 15.51%, 10.42%, 8.23%, and 28.41% compared to that produced by the parental strain
(p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in the contents of lactic acid and pyruvate
produced by both the mutants and the parental strain. Additionally, to assess the mutants’
capacity for malate transport between extracellular and intracellular compartments, the
fermentation experiment was conducted by inoculating simulated grape juice. The produc-
tion of intracellular L–malic acid was measured as depicted in Figure 5. The intracellular
L–malic acid contents in the mutants WYPN, WYPZ, WYPJ, and WYm1 were 0.473, 0.362,
0.285, and 0.792 g/L, respectively, indicating a significant improvement compared to the
parental strain. This demonstrates that the heterologous expression of genes encoding
malate permease significantly influences the transport of malic acid from extracellular to
intracellular compartments in S. uvarum.
In LAB, the malolactic enzyme converts L-malate to L-lactate without free interme-
diates or net reduction of NAD +; thus, the heterologous expressions of genes encoding
malolactic enzyme in WYSN, WYSz, and WYAJ lead to the degradation of L–malic acid,
and the L-lactate contents were increased significantly. The malic enzymes MAE1 in S.
uvarum and MAE2 in S. pombeare responsible for catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation
of L-malate to pyruvate and CO2. Although the L-malate production was slightly reduced,
pyruvate production of WYE and WYm2 were relatively similar to that of the parental strain
WY1, which was probably due to further metabolization of pyruvate to ethanol/lactic acid
and other flavor compounds under fermentative conditions. The expression of malolactic
enzyme from LAB and malic enzyme from S. uvarumand S. pombein S. uvarumcould not
effectively degrade malic acid to standard content (≤1 g/L), which was in accordance with
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 10 of 19
the results of the genes expressed in S. cerevisiae. These failed attempts contributed to the
absence of a malate transporter in S. uvarumas in S. cerevisiae[35].

Despite reports indicating that the degradation of L–malic acid primarily depends
on copies of the malate permease gene in LAB [19,34,35], the expression of the gene mleP
in L. lactis, L. plantarum, and O. oeni, or the gene MAE1 in S. pombe, which encodes for
malic enzyme in S. uvarumdid not result in further malate decarboxylation compared to
the heterologous expression of malolactic enzyme in LABs or malic enzyme in S. pombe.
Perhaps the lack of enhancement in malate decarboxylation in S. uvarummay be attributed
to the metabolic regulation of its cells. Conversely, while malic acid can be transported into
the cell via malate permease, the cell exhibits limited capacity and lacks efficient enzymes
for malic acid degradation. Hence, to facilitate the efficient metabolism of malic acid in S.

uvarum, a synergistic action of both malate permease and malate-degrading enzymes (such
as malolactic enzyme or malic enzyme) is indispensable.
3.2. Effects of Coexpression of Malate Permease mleP from L. lactis with Different Malolactic
Enzyme or Malic Enzyme Genes in S. uvarum on the Degradation of L–Malic Acid
The heterologous expression of single-gene encoding malate permease, malolactic
enzyme, or malic enzyme in S. uvarumproves ineffective in metabolizing malic acid, even
upon overexpression of the native gene MAE1. Consequently, the malate transport gene
mleP from L. lactis was heterologously expressed in S. uvarum in conjunction with the
malolactic enzyme gene (mleS in L. lactisand L. plantarum, mleA in O. oeni) or malic enzyme
gene MAE1 in S. uvarumand MAE2 in S. pombe, respectively. The mutants WYPSN, WYPSZ,
WYPAJ, WYPE, and WYPm2 were constructed. After fermentation, the results, as shown
in Figure 6, revealed that the production of L–malic acid by the mutant strains WYPS N,
WYPSZ, WYPAJ, WYPE, and WYPm2, was 2.455, 2.875, 2.982, 2.975, and 2.724 g/L, respec-
tively, indicating a reduction of 30.09%, 18.11%, 15.066%, 15.28%, and 22.43%, respectively,
compared to that produced by the parental strain ( p < 0.05). Additionally, the concen-
tration of L–lactic acid in the mutant strains WYPS N, WYPSZ, WYPAJ, was 2.708, 2.421,
and 2.385 g/L, respectively, showing an increase of approximately 15–17 fold compared
to that in the parental strain ( p < 0.05). Conversely, there were no significant changes
observed in the mutant strains WYPE, WYPm2, and the parental strain WY1. The results
demonstrated the combination of gene mleP of L. lactiswith different malolactic enzyme
or malic enzyme genes in S. uvarumdid not lead to further degradation of L–malic acid
compared with the single gene expressed in S. uvarum.The inefficiency observed may stem
from the fact that the decarboxylation system of L–malic acid in L. lactisnecessitates the
collaborative action of malate permease, malolactic enzyme, and other regulatory proteins.
It was reported that the activator protein MleR serves as a positive regulator crucial for
the expression of malolactic enzyme and the initiation of MLF in LABs [37]. Consequently,
the coexpression of MleP with malolactic enzyme or malic enzyme genes in S. uvarum
have failed to adequately complete the MLF process, potentially also due to the differential
expression of the heterologous genes in S. uvarum. Further research is warranted to delve
deeper into these observations.

3.3. Effects of Coexpression of Malate Permease MAE1 from S. pombe with Different Malolactic 
Enzyme or Malic Enzyme Genes in S. uvarum on the Degradation of L−Malic acid 
S. pombe demonstrates the capability to fully convert L-malate into ethanol and CO2 
during fermentation in wine, thereby contri buting to deacidification. The core system 
involved in this process consists of the malate transport (encoded by gene MAE1) and 
the malic enzyme (encoded by gene MAE2). In S. uvarum, the expression of the gene 
MAE1 was combined with malolactic enzyme genes ( mleS from L. lactis, L. plantarum, 
and mleA in O. oeni), or malic enzyme genes MAE1 in S. uvarum and MAE2 in S. pombe, 
resulting in the generation of mutants WYm1S N, WYm1A J, WYm1S Z, WYm1E, and 
WYm1m2. As depicted in Figure 7, the L-ma late concentrations of WYm1E, WYm1m2, 
WYm1SN, WYm1AJ, and WYm1S Z were 2.502, 1.105, 1.098, 2.788, and 2.452 g/L, respec-
tively, representing reductions of 28.75%, 68.52%, 68.74%, 20.61%, and 30.16%, respec-
tively, compared to those produced by the parental strain WY1 ( p < 0.05). Moreover, the 
L−lactic acid concentration increased in mutant strains WYm1S N and WYm1S Z to 2.437 
and 0.745 g/L, respectively, while it decreased by 20.53% in strain WYm1AJ, respectively. 
These findings demonstrate that the heterologous expression of these genes had a bene-
ficial effect on malate degradation, with strains WYm1m2 and WYm1S
N showing the 
best results, nearly reaching the defined threshold of malic acid (<1 g/L).

The coexpression of malate transport MAE1 from S. pombe with different malolactic 
enzymes or malic enzymes genes in S. uvarum exhibited different effects on the degrada-
tion of L −malic acid in wine.  Although O. oeni carried the much greater ability for dea-
cidification than any other LAB during MLF in wine, the gene mleA showed little effect 
on metabolizing L−malic acid with the malate transport MAE1 from S. pombe in S. uvar-
um. The result was inconsistent with the research reported by Husnik et al., in which the 
industrial strain of S. cerevisiae coexpressing the S. pombe malate permease gene ( MAE1) 
and the O. oeni malolactic gene ( mleA) could fully decarboxylated 5.5 g/L of malate in 
Chardonnay grape must and produced equimolar amounts of lactate [24]. Besides the al-
ternative expression of the heterologous gene in S. uvarum, it also is probably due to the 
NAD-dependent malolactic enzyme that is  subject to catabolite repression in S. uvarum 
exhibiting low substrate affinity. Furthermore, the decreased L −lactic acid concentration 
in strain WYm1A J may be attributed to more intracellular malate transported from the 
extracellular environment by malate permease, which was metabolized by the native 
malic enzyme rather than the malolactic enzyme. In addition, the result, which showed 
that the combination of S. pombe malate permease gene ( MAE1) and malic enzyme gene 
(MAE2) or L. lactis malolactic gene (mleS) could effectively degrade malate production to 
about 1 g/L during AF, was in accord with Volschenk and colleagues’ research, in which 
the mutant S. cerevisiae expressing the S. pombe MAE1 and MAE2 genes degraded 8 g/L 
malate in a glycerol–ethanol medium with in 7 days, and the recombinant malolactic S. 
cerevisiae (S. pombe MAE1 and L. lactis mleS genes) could ferment 4.5 g/L of malate in a 
synthetic grape must within 4 days [23].  L. plantarum strains were capable of surviving

The coexpression of malate transport MAE1 from S. pombewith different malolactic
enzymes or malic enzymes genes in S. uvarumexhibited different effects on the degradation
of L–malic acid in wine. AlthoughO. oenicarried the much greater ability for deacidification
than any other LAB during MLF in wine, the genemleA showed little effect on metabolizing
L–malic acid with the malate transport MAE1 from S. pombein S. uvarum. The result was

heterologous gene in S. uvarum, it also is probably due to the NAD-dependent malolactic
enzyme that is subject to catabolite repression in S. uvarumexhibiting low substrate affinity.
Furthermore, the decreased L–lactic acid concentration in strain WYm1AJ may be attributed
to more intracellular malate transported from the extracellular environment by malate
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 13 of 19
permease, which was metabolized by the native malic enzyme rather than the malolactic
enzyme. In addition, the result, which showed that the combination of S. pombemalate
permease gene (MAE1) and malic enzyme gene (MAE2) or L. lactismalolactic gene (mleS)

pombe MAE1and MAE2 genes degraded 8 g/L malate in a glycerol–ethanol medium within
7 days, and the recombinant malolactic S. cerevisiae(S. pombe MAE1and L. lactis mleSgenes)
could ferment 4.5 g/L of malate in a synthetic grape must within 4 days [23]. L. plantarum
strains were capable of surviving harsh wine conditions and displayed a more diverse
enzyme profile than O. oeni, whereas coexpression of S. pombe MAE1and L. plantarum
mleS genes did not completely metabolize the malate content to about 1 g/L. The results
also demonstrated that the main cause that the LAB completed the MLF in wine is that
the genes resisted the harsh wine conditions. The mechanisms underlying these effects,
however, require further research.
3.4. Effects of the Gene Expressions in S. uvarum on Higher Alcohols and Other Flavor
Substances Production
Currently, research on the regulation of genes involved in deacidification inS. cerevisiae
during alcoholic fermentation (AF) largely concentrates on studying individual substances
such as malic acid, precursors, or metabolites within a single metabolic pathway, neglecting
the balance of wine flavor. Higher alcohols and esters, crucial factors determining the
sensory characteristics and flavor profile quality in wine, were detected to assess the impact
of heterologous gene expressions in S. uvarum, as outlined in Table 3. The production of
flavor substances was not affected by the overexpression of the MAE1 gene encoding malic
enzyme in S. uvarum. In mutant WYm2, with heterologous expression of the gene MAE2
from S. pombe, isoamyl alcohol and ethyl acetate levels were 212.105 and 28.520 mg/L,
reflecting increases of 5.25% and 22.40%, respectively, compared to the parental strain WY1
(isoamyl alcohol content: 201.530 mg/L; ethyl acetate production: 23.301 mg/L, p < 0.05).
In addition, the production of isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, and ethyl
lactate were variably affected as the heterologous expression of malolactic enzyme genes.
For example, the isobutyl alcohol contents of strains WYS N, WYAJ, WYSZ were 29.955,
31.832, and 32.375 mg/L, showing reductions of 15.27%, 9.96%, and 8.43%, respectively,
compared to the parental strain WY1 (35.354 mg/L). The isoamyl alcohol contents of
the mutants were 176.282, 189.205, and 191.472 mg/L, representing decreases of 12.53%,
6.12%, and 5.04%, respectively, compared to the parental strain WY1 (201.53 mg/L). The
ethyl acetate production by the mutants were 21.716, 21.573, and 21.630 mg/L, exhibiting
reductions of 6.80%, 7.42%, and 7.17%, respectively, compared to the parental strain WY1
(23.301 mg/L). The ethyl lactate levels in the mutants increased to 11.115, 5.065, and
6.130 mg/L, respectively. Additionally, the isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, and ethyl
acetate contents produced by WYPN (with heterologous expression of gene mleP encoding
malate permease from L. lactis) were 36.335, 217.858, and 27.482 mg/L, increased by 2.78%,
8.10%, and 17.90%, respectively. Lastly, those produced by mutant WYm1 (heterologous
expression of gene MAE1 encoding malate permease from S. pombe), were 45.244, 223.662,
and 25.915 mg/L, reflecting improvements of 27.98%, 10.98%, and 11.22%, respectively,
compared to those produced by the parental strain WY1.
The heterologous expression of the malic enzyme gene MAE2 from S. pombe in S.
uvarum WY1 resulted in a significant increase in the content of ethyl acetate and isoamyl
alcohol in wine. This may be attributed to the fact that expression of the malic enzyme
gene MAE2 in S. uvarumWY1 resulted in the conversion of malic acid to pyruvic acid.
Subsequently, a portion of the pyruvic acid was metabolized to produce acetaldehyde,
which further formed acetic acid and was then esterified with ethanol to generate ethyl
acetate. Another portion of pyruvic acid was channeled through a series of enzymes in the
ILV pathway, leading to the formation ofα-keto acid, eventually resulting in the production
of isoamyl alcohol (as shown in Figure 8). The malolactic enzyme encoded by gene mleS or
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 14 of 19
mleA degrades malic acid to lactic acid. And the lactic acid reacts with ethanol to produce
ethyl lactate, effectively slowing the metabolic flow from malic acid to pyruvic acid in S.
uvarum. Thus, the production of isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol were reduced after
pyruvic acid metabolism. Additionally, alterations in L–malic acid levels could affect the
tricarboxylic acid cycle, and then impacts the metabolism of compounds such as pyruvic
acid and α-ketoglutaric acid in S. uvarum, thereby leading to variations in higher alcohols
and ethyl acetate concentration in wine. Malate permease plays a crucial role in supporting
MLF. We suspect that that the heterologous expression of genemleP promoted the L–malic
acid transfer from extracellular to intracellular, induced the expression of malic enzyme
in S. uvarumand facilitated the conversion of malate to pyruvate. This process, in turn,
leads to an increase in levels of higher alcohols. Additionally, malate permease-regulated
malate transporter proteins exhibit permeability to other extracellular dibasic acids, such as
α-ketoglutarate. This dual function affects the tricarboxylic acid cycle in S. uvarum. In yeast
cells, aminotransfer between amino acids and their corresponding α-keto acids is catalyzed
by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCAATases) in both the mitochondria
and cytoplasm. This process synthesizes leucine, isoleucine, and valine using glutamate
and α-ketoglutarate as donor and acceptor, respectively. Furthermore, the amino acids and
α-ketoglutarate are utilized to produce the corresponding α-keto acids by transaminases.
These α-keto acids, such as α-ketoisovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, and α-ketoisocaproic
acid, undergo decarboxylation and dehydrogenation to produce isobutanol and isopentyl
alcohol [38–40].

Therefore, the coexpression of the malate permease gene and either the malolactic
enzyme gene or the malic enzyme gene in the mutants exhibited varying effects on the
content of higher alcohols and esters in wine. The malate transporter facilitated the transfer
of L-malate and α-ketoglutarate from the extracellular environment to the intracellular
space. The transportation promotes the expression of malic enzyme and malolactamase
genes (as shown in Figure 2), leading to the degradation of malic acid into lactic acid or
pyruvic acid. Consequently, the metabolism of higher alcohols and esters were affected
differently. Of the mutants, strain WYm1SN exhibited the best effect whether on higher
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 15 of 19
alcohols levels or on esters production. The increased lactic acid content led to an ethyl
lactate concentration rising from approximately 0 to about 13.990 mg/L. This finding is
essentially consistent with our previous report on wine fermented by yeast and LAB simul-
taneously [16]. Additionally, the production of higher alcohols was effectively reduced.
Excessive levels of higher alcohols can contribute to the generation of a strong fusel oil
flavor and pose potential health problems.

reduced. Excessive levels of higher alcohols can contribute to the generation of a strong 
fusel oil flavor and pose potential health problems.

3.5. Effects of the Gene Expressions in S. uvarum on Growth and Fermentation Performance 
A stable fermentation performance of the mutant strain was closely related with 
liquor yield, fermentation period, and flavor quality of the wine in industrial fermenta-
tion. Thus, the physiological characteristic and fermentation performances, such as etha-
nol, residual sugar, and organic acid of wine, were determined to investigate the effects 
of heterologous expressions of the genes in S. uvarum. Growth curves, which were de-
tected during the culture of yeast cells at 30 °C in YEPD medium, showed that the mu-
tant strains exhibited a similar growth rate and final cell density as the parental strain. 
Weight losses were detected every 12 h during the fermentation process, and production 
of ethanol, residual sugar, and organic acid in wine were detected after AF. Table 4 and 
Figures 9 and 10 suggest that the mutant st rains with heterologous expressions of the 
genes had similar fermentation rate and no obvious changes in the liquor yield and re-
sidual sugar compared with the parental strain WY1.

In current study, we constructed a biological pathway of deacidification intoS. uvarum,
which make the S. uvarumcarry out the AF and MLF simultaneously, as different genes
related to the deacidification were heterologously expressed in S. uvarum. Analysis of
L–malic acid production and other flavor substances (higher alcohols and esters) produced
by the mutant strains with different gene expression and coexpression suggested different
roles for the relevant enzymes during deacidification of AF in wine. In addition, of all the
recombinant strains, the engineered S. uvarumthat expressed gene MAE1 from S. pombe
and mleS from L. lactisexhibited the best effect, not only on deacidification of the wine, but
Foods 2024, 13, 2038 16 of 19
also on the improvement in flavor quality. Our work settled several important questions
caused by LAB in deacidification of MLF, and shortened the fermentation period.
