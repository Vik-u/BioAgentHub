Abstract
C
4 
photosynthesis is a highly efficient form of photosynthesis that utilizes a biochemical pump to concentrate CO
2 
around rubisco. 
Although variation in the implementation of this biochemical pump exists between species, each variant of the C
4 
pathway is critically 
dependent on metabolite transport between organelles and between cells. Here we review our understanding of metabolite transport in 
C
4 
photosynthesis. We discuss how the majority of our knowledge of the metabolite transporters co-opted for use in C
4 
photosynthesis 
has been obtained from studying C
3 
plants and how there is a pressing need for in planta validation of transporter function in C
4 
species. We further explore the diversity of transport pathways present in disparate C
4 
lineages and highlight the important gaps in our 
understanding of metabolite transport in C
4 
plants. Finally, through integration of functional and transcriptional data from multiple C
3 
and C
4 
plants, we propose a molecular blueprint for metabolite transport for NAD-malic enzyme C
4 
photosynthesis.
Introduction
Photosynthesis is the process through which plants use solar en -
ergy to convert atmospheric CO
2 
into sugars. Most land plants 
carry out a form of photosynthesis known as C
3 
photosynthesis, 
in which rubisco combines CO
2 
with the 5-carbon sugar ribulose 
1,5-bisphosphate to generate 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate 
(3-PGA). However, the efficiency of C
3 
photosynthesis is decreased 
by a competing reaction wherein rubisco combines O
2 
with ribu -
lose 1,5-bisphosphate. This competing reaction produces 1 mole -
cule each of 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG), of which the 
latter inhibits enzymes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle and 
starch biosynthesis and must be recycled. While the affinity of ru -
bisco for O
2 
is much lower than for CO
2
, atmospheric concentra -
tion of O
2 
is 525 times higher than that of CO
2
; thus, the ratio of 
carboxylation:oxygenation in C
3 
plants is ∼3:1 ( Ehleringer et al. 
1991 ). As a consequence, the direct cost of photorespiration and 
the indirect costs of reassimilation of the released CO
2 
and NH
4
+ 
are thought to result in losses of up to ∼50% of leaf energy 
( Peterhansel et al. 2010 ).
To mitigate the cost of photorespiration, several plant lineages 
have evolved adaptations to increase the concentration of CO
2 
compared with O
2 
around rubisco ( Keeley and Rundel 2003 ; Sage 
2016 ; Edwards 2019 ; Heyduk et al. 2019 ). These disparate lineages 
can be categorized into 2 different photosynthetic types: crassula -
cean acid metabolism and C
4 
photosynthesis. Both photosyn -
thetic types function by the same principle of initially fixing 
HCO
3
− 
instead of CO
2 
using phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 
(PEPC), an enzyme that is less sensitive to oxygen than rubisco 
( Sharwood et al. 2016 ). In C
4 
plants, the separation of initial carbon 
fixation by PEPC and carbon reduction by rubisco is achieved spa -
tially. CO
2 
is fixed by PEPC in mesophyll cells into 4-carbon organic 
acids. These 4-carbon organic acids are then moved to a spatially 
separated location that contains rubisco, where the fixed CO
2 
is 
then released. While some plants achieve this spatial separation 
within a single cell ( Edwards et al. 2004 ), in most cases the C
4 
path -
way is split between 2 specialized cell types, known as the 
mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Irrespective of the anatomical 
manner in which the partitioning is achieved, the biochemical 
pump acts to deliver superatmospheric concentrations of CO
2 
to 
rubisco ( Furbank and Hatch 1987 ). Accordingly, C
4 
plants have de -
creased rates of photorespiration and increased photosynthetic 
efficiency and can have increased maximal photosynthetic rates 
( Evans and von Caemmerer 2000 ). As a corollary of these adapta -
tions, C
4 
photosynthesis is also associated with enhanced nitro -
gen use and water use efficiencies, as less nitrogen needs to be 
invested in rubisco to achieve the same rate of carbon fixation 
( Sage et al. 1987 ), and the carbon-concentrating effect allows pho -
tosynthetic rate to remain high despite low intercellular CO
2 
con -
centration caused by stomatal closure ( Way et al. 2014 ).
C
4 
photosynthesis has evolved independently at least 60 times 
during the evolution of land plants ( Sage 2016 ). As a consequence 
of the large number of independent origins, the C
4 
trait encom -
passes significant variation between species. Biochemically, C
4 
plants are classified into 3 subtypes, based on the decarboxylation 
enzyme with the highest activity in the leaf ( Hatch et al. 1975 ). 
These are chloroplastic NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), mito -
chondrial NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), or cytosolic phosphoenol -
pyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) ( Fig. 1 ). While the specialization of 
the bundle sheath is substantially different between subtypes, 
all share similar metabolic adaptations in the mesophyll ( Fig. 1 ). 
The commonalities are: 1) pyruvate is converted to phosphoenol -
pyruvate (PEP) by chloroplastic pyruvate, phosphate dikinase. 
2) Carbonic anhydrase converts CO
2 
into HCO
3
−
, and 3) PEPC gener -
ates oxaloacetate (OAA) from the combination of HCO
3
− 
and PEP. 
As OAA is short-lived and spontaneously decomposes back to 
pyruvate and CO
2 
( Tsai 1967 ), OAA is imported into the mesophyll 
chloroplast, where it is stabilized as either malate [by NADP- 
malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH)] or aspartate [by aspartate 
aminotransferase (AspAT)], depending on the C
4 
subtype. If OAA 
is stabilized as malate, then it is decarboxylated in the bundle 
sheath to produce pyruvate and CO
2 
by chloroplastic NADP-ME 
( Fig. 1A ). If OAA is stabilized as aspartate, then there are 2 potential

routes depending on the primary decarboxylase that is used. In 
NAD-ME subtype C
4 
photosynthesis, the aspartate is imported 
into the bundle sheath cell mitochondrion, converted back to 
OAA by mitochondrial AspAT, restabilized as malate by mitochon -
drial NAD-MDH, and decarboxylated to produce pyruvate and CO
2 
by mitochondrial NAD-ME ( Fig. 1B ). In PCK subtype C
4 
photosyn -
thesis, the aspartate is converted to OAA by cytosolic aspartate 
amino transferase and then directly decarboxylated to produce 
PEP and CO
2 
by cytosolic PCK ( Fig. 1C ). Although 3 separate 
subtypes (NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PCK) have been described, a 
strict categorization into these subtypes is now considered to be 
an oversimplification. Instead, many C
4 
plants possess mixed 
cycles utilizing more than 1 decarboxylase ( Furbank 2011 ; Wang 
et al. 2014 ), and aspartate can be used as an alternative transfer 
metabolite in NADP-ME subtype C
4 
photosynthesis ( Leegood and 
von Caemmerer 1989 ). Thus, there is likely a wide range in com -
plexity and diversity in the manifestation of C
4 
pathways within 
and between C
4 
species.

C
4 
photosynthesis is highly dependent 
on intracellular metabolite transport
A defining feature of C
4 
photosynthesis is the requirement for ex -
tensive movement of metabolites across the membranes of both 
chloroplasts and mitochondria in multiple different cell types 
( Fig. 1 ). Due to this spatial compartmentalization, C
4 
photosyn -
thesis is much more dependent on metabolite transport than 
C
3 
photosynthesis. In C
3 
photosynthesis the assimilation of 
3 molecules of CO
2 
into a single molecule of triose phosphate re -
quires just 1 intracellular metabolite transport step: the export 
of that triose phosphate from the chloroplast into the cytosol 
via the triose phosphate translocator (TPT) ( Fig. 2A ). In contrast, 
the assimilation of the same number of molecules of CO
2 
using 
the NADP-ME C
4 
pathway requires at least 31 metabolite trans -
port steps ( Weber and von Caemmerer 2010 ) ( Fig. 2B ). Despite 
the importance of intracellular metabolite transport for C
4 
photosynthesis, our understanding of the transporters responsi -
ble for these transport steps lags behind our knowledge of 
the enzymes involved in the C
4 
cycle. This limits our under -
standing of how C
4 
plants achieve their high photosynthetic effi -
ciency as well as enhanced nitrogen and water use efficiencies. 
Moreover, this knowledge gap prevents the engineering of C
4 
photosynthesis into C
3 
plants to improve their yield. Here we re -
view the current state of understanding of metabolite transport 
in C
4 
photosynthesis. As all extant examples of C
4 
photosynthe -
sis evolved from C
3 
photosynthetic ancestors, we discuss how 
these C
4 
cycle transporters have been co-opted from ancestral 
functions in C
3 
metabolism. We also highlight the major gaps 
in our understanding of metabolite transport in C
4 
photosyn -
thesis and, through synthesis of the available transport and 
transcriptomic data, propose a complete transport model for 
NAD-ME C
4 
photosynthesis.
Chloroplast dicarboxylate transport in the C
4 
cycle—co-option of transporters from nitrogen 
assimilation and redox homeostasis
All known manifestations of C
4 
photosynthesis require dicar -
boxylate transport across the mesophyll chloroplast envelope, 
and the NADP-ME subtype also requires dicarboxylate transport 
across the bundle sheath chloroplast envelope ( Fig. 1 ). Transport 
of dicarboxylates across the chloroplast envelope occurs primar -
ily via transporters belonging to the divalent anion-sodium sym -
porter family ( Sauer et al. 2020 ). Although this family contains 
both symporters and exchangers, it is named after the Na
+
: 
dicarboxylate symport mechanism exhibited by most of its bacte -
rial and mammalian members ( Taniguchi and Miyake 2012 ). To 
date, all characterized members of the dicarboxylate transporter 
(DCT or DiT) subfamily from plants function as chloroplast- 
localized dicarboxylate exchangers and were first identified in 
pursuit of transporters involved in chloroplast nitrogen metabo -
lism ( Taniguchi et al. 2002 , 2004 ; Renné et al. 2003 ).
Photorespiratory nitrogen assimilation via the glutamine syn -
thetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase pathway in C
3 
plants requires the exchange of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) for gluta -
mate at the chloroplast envelope ( Woo et al. 1987 ). The first char -
acterization of this activity came from the observation of the 
release of preloaded radio-labeled dicarboxylates from isolated 
spinach chloroplasts in exchange for external dicarboxylates 
( Heldt and Rapley 1970 ). Determination of the transport kinetics 
for a range of different dicarboxylates suggested the existence of 
2 separate exchangers of overlapping specificity: one that prefer -
entially transports aspartate, and one that preferentially trans -
ports non-amino acid dicarboxylates ( Fig. 3A ) ( Lehner and Heldt 
1978 ; Anderson and Walker 1983 ; Dry and Wiskich 1983 ; 
Woo et al. 1987 ). The purification and kinetic characterization of

The metabolite transporters of C

a 2-OG/Malate transporter (OMT1, sometimes referred to as DiT1), 
which is unable to transport amino acids ( Menzlaff and Flügge 
1993 ; Weber et al. 1995 ; Taniguchi et al. 2002 ; Renné et al. 
2003 ), matched the first of these hypothesized transporters. 
Subsequently, a general Dicarboxylate Transporter (DCT, some -
times referred to as DiT2), identified through kinetic analysis of 
spinach chloroplasts preloaded with glutamate, matched the sec -
ond ( Flügge et al. 1988 ; Taniguchi et al. 2002 ; Renné et al. 2003 ).
Nitrogen assimilation is not the only cellular process that re -
quires dicarboxylate exchange across the chloroplast envelope. 
Reducing equivalents generated by photosynthetic electron trans -
port must also be exported from the chloroplast to be used by the 
rest of the cell. One mechanism for this transport is the chloro -
plast “malate valve” in which an OAA/malate exchanger acts in 
combination with malate dehydrogenases acting in opposite di -
rections on either side of the membrane ( Scheibe 2004 ) ( Fig. 3B ). 
A significantly increased K
m 
for OAA uptake into chloroplasts iso -
lated from omt1 mutant A. thaliana suggests that OMT1 is the high- 
affinity OAA transporter that forms part of the malate valve in A. 
thaliana chloroplasts ( Kinoshita et al. 2011 ).
In C
4 
photosynthesis, the DCT transporters described above 
have been co-opted from their ancestral roles to facilitate carbon 
flux through the C
4 
cycle by mediating dicarboxylate exchange 
across the chloroplast envelope ( Taniguchi et al. 2004 ). In maize 
there are 3 DCT subfamily genes: OMT1, DCT1, and DCT2. 
ZmOMT1 is expressed strongly in the mesophyll, ZmDCT1 is ex -
pressed to a lower level and preferentially in the mesophyll, and 
ZmDCT2 is expressed strongly in the bundle sheath ( Taniguchi 
et al. 2004 ; Majeran et al. 2008 ; Chang et al. 2012 ) ( Fig. 3C ). It has 
therefore been proposed that ZmOMT1 facilitates exchange of cy -
tosolic OAA with chloroplastic malate in the mesophyll cell as 
part of the C
4 
cycle ( Taniguchi et al. 2004 ) ( Fig. 3D ). In a similar

manner, ZmDCT1 localized in the mesophyll chloroplast envelope 
may facilitate the exchange of OAA with chloroplastic aspartate 
(generated by AspAT) as part of the auxiliary PCK cycle in maize 
( Fig. 3D ). Although the properties of these transporters in maize 
match the required functions ( Taniguchi et al. 2004 ), and the pat -
terns of expression observed in C
4 
plants indicate they are in the 
right cell types ( Fig. 3C ), these hypotheses have not formally been 
tested; thus, the generation and characterization of omt1 and dct1 
mutants in C
4 
plants are necessary to confirm these roles.
In contrast to the proposed role of OMT1 in the mesophyll cell 
chloroplast, ZmDCT2 is proposed to be involved in the import 
of malate into the bundle sheath chloroplast in the NADP-ME 
C
4 
cycle ( Weissmann et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 3E ). This is supported by 
the analysis of dct2 mutant maize, from which isolated bundle 
sheath chloroplasts show lower rates of malate uptake compared 
with those from wild-type plants ( Weissmann et al. 2016 ). 
Additionally, radio-labeled CO
2 
and malate feeding experiments 
(using whole plants and isolated bundle sheath cells, respectively) 
indicate an increased production of aspartate in place of malate, 
consistent with a diversion in flux from the disrupted NADP-ME 
C
4 
cycle to the auxiliary PCK cycle ( Weissmann et al. 2016 ). It 
should be noted that DCT2, being an obligate dicarboxylate ex -
changer, cannot by itself facilitate the net import of malate into 
the bundle sheath chloroplast that is required for flux through 
the C
4 
cycle. Therefore, a model has been proposed that involves 
the existence of a separate, as-yet-unidentified aspartate uniport -
er (or cation symporter), which imports aspartate into the bundle 
sheath chloroplast so that DCT2 can carry out aspartate export in 
exchange for malate import ( Weissmann et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 3E ). This 
proposal is consistent with previous observations that malate- 
dependent pyruvate formation from maize bundle sheath cells 
or chloroplasts is stimulated by aspartate ( Chapman and Hatch 
1979 ; Jenkins and Boag 1985 ). Also consistent with the role of 
DCT transporters in bundle sheath chloroplast malate uptake is 
the low expression of genes encoding these transporters in species 
that do not take up malate into bundle sheath chloroplasts, such 
as Panicum virgatum ( Fig. 3C ), Gynandropsis gynandra ( Bräutigam 
et al. 2011 ), and Urochloa fusca ( Rao et al. 2016 ). Therefore, although 
DCT2 is likely part of the solution, the molecular mechanism of 
how malate enters the bundle sheath chloroplast in NADP-ME 
C
4 
photosynthesis is still to be resolved.
Chloroplast triose phosphate transport in the C
4 
cycle: co-option of a C
3 
redox valve to balance 
energy metabolism between bundle sheath and 
mesophyll cells
NADP-ME subtype C
4 
photosynthesis requires the exchange of TP 
and 3-PGA across the envelope of both mesophyll and bundle 
sheath chloroplasts ( Fig. 2B ). This exchange, while not part of 
the core C
4 
cycle, is a necessary feature of NADP-ME C
4 
photosyn -
thesis due to the downregulation of PSII in the bundle sheath ( Woo 
et al. 1970 ). This downregulation leads to increased cyclic electron 
transport around PSI, which produces ATP but not NADPH. The 
absence of NADPH production assists in kinetically favoring the 
forward reaction of NADP-ME ( Bräutigam et al. 2018 ). However, 
the reduction stage of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle also lo -
cated in the bundle sheath cell requires NADPH, and stoichiomet -
rically only one-half of this can be provided by NADP-ME through 
decarboxylation of malate ( Weber and von Caemmerer 2010 ). 
Therefore, one-half of the 3-PGA generated in the bundle sheath 
chloroplast must be transported to the mesophyll chloroplast to 
be converted to triose phosphate, through the actions of 
phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehygrogenase (GAPDH), utilizing NADPH produced by linear 
electron transport in the mesophyll ( Taniguchi and Miyake 
2012 ). Triose phosphate must then be returned to the bundle 
sheath chloroplast for the completion of the Calvin-Benson- 
Bassham cycle ( Weber and von Caemmerer 2010 ).
The primary transport flux of triose phosphates across the 
chloroplast inner envelope occurs via the TPT. TPT is a member 
of the larger Drug/Metabolite Transporter superfamily. TPT fam -
ily proteins are specific to eukaryotes ( Jack et al. 2001 ) and cata -
lyze the exchange of phosphorylated monocarboxylates with 
inorganic phosphate (P
i
) ( Lee et al. 2017 ). The first observation of 
TPT activity was the exchange of P
i 
with phosphorylated 3-carbon 
compounds across the envelopes of isolated spinach chloroplasts 
( Heldt and Rapley 1970 ). The rate of exchange was high with triose 
phosphates phosphorylated on the third carbon, lower for those 
phosphorylated on the second carbon, and lower still for sugar 
phosphates ( Heldt and Rapley 1970 ; Fliege et al. 1978 ). Given these 
transport properties, an obvious function for TPT is the export 
of the primary products of photosynthesis from the chloroplast 
to the cytosol. Accordingly, in C
3 
plants TPT plays a direct role 
in the coordination between sucrose and starch biosynthesis 
( Riesmeier et al. 1993 ) ( Fig. 4A ).
In addition to the main role of TPT above, supplementary roles for 
TPT in C
3 
plants have also been described. Similar to the chloroplast 
malate valve, TPT can act in concert with chloroplastic and cytosolic 
enzymes to indirectly export reducing equivalents to the cytosol, 
although in this case TPT also results in the indirect export of 
ATP to the cytosol ( Taniguchi and Miyake 2012 ). Here, in the chlor -
oplast 3-PGA is converted by the ATP-consuming PGK and 
NADPH-consuming GAPDH into GAP, while in the cytosol GAP is 
converted by the NADH-producing GAPDH and ATP-producing 
PGK back to 3-PGA. In this way, both ATP and reducing power are in -
directly “shuttled” from the chloroplast to the cytosol ( Fig. 4B ). In C
4 
plants, it is this shuttle-like function of TPT that is co-opted into the 
C
4 
cycle. However, unlike in C
3 
plants where this shuttle functions in 
the context of a single cell ( Fig. 4B ), in C
4 
plants it is distributed 
across the 2 cell types to transfer reducing equivalents produced 
by linear electron transport in mesophyll chloroplasts to bundle 
sheath chloroplasts ( Fig. 4C ). Consistent with this role, NADP-ME 
subtype C
4 
plants show higher leaf TPT RNA and TPT protein levels 
than C
3 
plants ( Bräutigam et al. 2008 ; Gowik et al. 2011 ), and high 
TPT RNA and TPT protein levels in both mesophyll and bundle 
sheath ( Chang et al. 2012 ; John et al. 2014 ; Emms et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 4D ).
Although this shuttle is thought to primarily function in 
NADP-ME C
4 
photosynthesis, it should be noted that TPT is also ex -
pressed to high levels in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of 
NAD-ME subtype C
4 
plants such as P. virgatum ( Fig. 4D ) and G. gynan -
dra ( Rao et al. 2016 ), despite the fact that NAD-ME plants do not show 
depleted bundle sheath chloroplast PSII activity ( Koteyeva et al. 
2014 ). It is therefore possible that redox/ATP balancing is required 
between mesophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts in all C
4 
plants, 
not just in NADP-ME subtype C
4 
plants where the downregulation of 
PSII in the bundle sheath makes this need more apparent.
Chloroplast pyruvate import in the C
4 
cycle: 
co-option of the entry point transporter for 
terpenoid biosynthesis
All known C
4 
cycles require pyruvate import across the mesophyll 
chloroplast envelope ( Fig. 2 ). Unlike all other transport reactions 
discussed in this review, in which the transport reaction was first 
demonstrated in C
3 
plants, pyruvate uptake into chloroplasts was

first demonstrated using chloroplasts isolated from the mesophyll 
cells of the C
4 
plant Digitaria sanguinalis ( Huber and Edwards 1977 ). 
It was later shown that this transport reaction in maize is light de -
pendent ( Flügge et al. 1985 ), and in Panicum miliaceum that pyru -
vate uptake is directly dependent on the proton gradient that is 
generated across the chloroplast envelope under illumination 
( Ohnishi and Kanai 1987 ). Subsequent sampling across a broader 
species range revealed that light-dependent chloroplast pyruvate 
uptake can be divided into 2 mechanisms: H
+
- and Na
+
-dependent 
( Aoki et al. 1992 ). H
+
-dependent pyruvate uptake is limited to 2 sis -
ter lineages within the grasses that are both derived from the 
same origin of C
4 
photosynthesis ( Grass Phylogeny Working 
Group II 2012 ): the Arundinelleae and Andropogoneae, the latter 
of which contains several important C
4 
crop species such as 
maize, sugarcane, and sorghum. Na
+
-dependent pyruvate uptake, 
on the other hand, was found in all other monocot as well as all 
dicot clades tested so far ( Aoki et al. 1992 ). Thus, there are likely 
2 molecularly distinct transporter families that facilitate pyruvate 
uptake into mesophyll cell chloroplasts.
Knockout studies in A. thaliana identified that the likely candi -
date for Na
+
-dependent pyruvate import was BASS2 in conjunc -
tion with Na
+
/H
+ 
antiporter 1 (NHD1) ( Furumoto et al. 2011 ) 
( Fig. 5A ). Analysis of these plants led to the proposal that BASS2 
functions in C

plants to import pyruvate into the chloroplast

noid biosynthesis ( Furumoto et al. 2011 ) ( Fig. 5A ). Both BASS2 
and NHD1 are expressed to higher levels in the leaves of 
Na
+
-type C
4 
species than in close C
3 
relatives ( Bräutigam et al. 
2011 , 2014 ) but not H
+
-type C
4 
species or C
3 
species ( Rao et al. 
2016 ) ( Fig. 5B ). BASS2 also facilitates pyruvate uptake when heter -
ologously expressed in E. coli, which is increased by the addition of 
Na
+ 
( Furumoto et al. 2011 ). The model for BASS2 function in C
4 
species thus involves the utilization by NHD1 of the light- 
dependent proton gradient across the chloroplast inner envelope 
to couple the import of H
+ 
down the proton gradient to the export 
of Na
+ 
into the intermembrane space. This enables pyruvate to be 
imported by pyruvate/Na
+ 
symport through BASS2 ( Fig. 5C ). 
Although there is strong evidence to support a role for BASS2 in 
Na
+
-dependent C
4 
photosynthesis, physiological evaluation of 
loss of function or RNAi lines in C
4 
species has not yet been carried 
out. Moreover, the identity of the H
+
-dependent pyruvate uptake 
transporter is yet to be discovered.
Chloroplast PEP export in the C
4 
cycle: co-option 
and reversal of the PEP/P
i 
translocator
The final transport step of all known C
4 
cycles is the export of PEP 
across the chloroplast envelope in the mesophyll cell ( Fig. 2 ). In C
3 
plants, this transport function is carried out by a member of the 
TPT family of transporters called the PEP/P
i 
translocator (PPT), 
which transports triose phosphates that have been phosphorylated 
on the second carbon ( Fischer et al. 1997 ). In A. thaliana there are 2 
PPT genes: PPT1 and PPT2. While PPT2 is ubiquitously expressed 
throughout the leaf, PPT1 is specifically expressed in the vascula -
ture of leaves and roots ( Fischer et al. 1997 ; Knappe et al. 2003 ). 
Both PPT1 and PPT2 are thought to import PEP into the chloroplast 
for entry into the shikimate pathway and production of aromatic 
amino acids ( Knappe et al. 2003 ; Voll et al. 2003 ) ( Fig. 6A ). 
Loss-of-function plants have impaired chloroplast development 
caused by a deficit in PEP-derived phenylalanine and downstream 
phenolic compounds ( Voll et al. 2003 ).
In C
4 
plants of all subtypes, the inverse of the C
3 
plant PEP trans -
port reaction described above is required. Rather than PEP import, 
PEP must be exported from the mesophyll chloroplast to provide 
the substrate for PEPC ( Fig. 6B ). Usually, an ortholog of PPT1 has 
been co-opted for function in the C
4 
cycle ( Lyu et al. 2020 ) and cor -
respondingly shows higher RNA and protein levels in C
4 
plants than 
in C
3 
relatives ( Bräutigam et al. 2008 , 2011 , 2014 ; Gowik et al. 2011 ), 
as well as preferential expression in the mesophyll ( Chang et al. 
2012 ; John et al. 2014 ; Emms et al. 2016 ; Rao et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 6C ). 
Although transport activity and cell-type expression data are highly 
indicative, PPT function in the C
4 
cycle has never been directly 
tested through analysis of PPT knockdown or knockout C
4 
plants.
Mitochondrial pyruvate transport in the C
4 
cycle: 
co-option and reversal of the transporter for 
pyruvate uptake
The NAD-ME subtype C
4 
cycle requires export of pyruvate across 
the mitochondrial membrane in the bundle sheath cell ( Fig. 1B ). 
Across eukaryotes, pyruvate/H

symport into mitochondria is re -
quired for anaplerotic provision of pyruvate to the TCA cycle

( Fig. 7A ) and is facilitated by members of the Mitochondrial 
Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) family ( Halestrap 1975 ; Herzig et al. 
2012 ). The MPC family in plants comprises multiple members, 
and mitochondria isolated from mpc mutants in A. thaliana show 
significantly decreased pyruvate uptake rates and pyruvate- 
dependent O
2 
consumption ( Le et al. 2021 ). As for PPT1 described 
above, the direction of transport of MPC required for function in 
the NAD-ME C
4 
cycle is opposite to that which has been described 
in C
3 
plants and other eukaryotes ( Fig. 7B ). Also as for PPT1, tran -
scriptomic data in C
4 
species supports the putative role of MPC 
family proteins in carrying out this transport reaction. For exam -
ple, the NAD-ME subtype monocot P. virgatum shows preferential 
expression in the bundle sheath for MPC1 and MPC2 ( Rao et al. 
2016 ) ( Fig. 7C ). This is in contrast to NADP-ME subtype monocots, 
which show only very low bundle sheath expression of MPC genes, 
as would be expected given the lack of mitochondrial pyruvate ex -
port in this subtype ( Chang et al. 2012 ; John et al. 2014 ; Emms et al. 
2016 ) ( Fig. 7C ).
Interestingly, similar to pyruvate uptake into chloroplasts de -
scribed above, there may be multiple potential routes for pyruvate 
export from mitochondria in NAD-ME C
4 
species. The rationale for 
this proposal is that mitochondria isolated from mpc1 knockout A. 
thaliana are capable of exporting large quantities pyruvate ( Le et al. 
2021 ), indicating the presence of another, as-yet-unidentified mito -
chondrial pyruvate exporter. Thus, while it is plausible that MPC 
may play a role in NAD-ME C
4 
photosynthesis in P. virgatum, the 
precise role that it plays needs to be validated. Moreover, the iden -
tity of any uncharacterized pyruvate exporters and their role in 
NAD-ME C
4 
species remains to be elucidated.
Mitochondrial malate transport in the C
4 
cycle: 
co-option of a redox exchange mechanism to 
support aspartate uptake
The NAD-ME subtype C
4 
cycle requires net import of aspartate 
into the bundle sheath mitochondria for operation of the 
CO
2
-concentrating mechanism ( Fig. 1B ). Mitochondrial aspartate 
import also requires uptake of 2-OG to support the trans- 
amination reaction catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase to 
convert aspartate into OAA. However, mitochondria isolated 
from the NAD-ME C
4 
plant Atriplex spongiosa were found to require 
not only 2-OG but also malate and P
i 
to sustain maximal rates of 
pyruvate and O
2 
formation from aspartate ( Kagawa and Hatch 
1975 ; Furbank et al. 1990 ). The exchange of malate and P
i 
across 
the mitochondrial membrane is known to be carried out by mem -
bers of the DIC family of transporters in eukaryotes ( Palmieri et al. 
2008 ). In C
3 
plants, these transporters also carry out the counter 
exchange of several dicarboxylates (including malate, OAA, and 
succinate), and accordingly several potential roles have been pro -
posed ( Fig. 8A ). First, DICs may facilitate the anaplerotic provision 
of dicarboxylates for the TCA cycle ( Palmieri et al. 2008 ), which is 
consistent with the fact that malate and succinate oxidation in 
plant mitochondria is inhibited by known inhibitors of DIC 
( DeSantis et al. 1976 ; Day and Hanson 1977 ). Second, DICs may 
also exchange malate and OAA and act in concert with cytosolic 
and mitochondrial MDHs to transfer reducing equivalents be -
tween cytosol and mitochondria in an analogous way to OMT1 
in the chloroplast ( Palmieri et al. 2008 ). Third, high expression of 
DIC1 and DIC2 in cotyledons may indicate a role in the exchange

of OAA and malate with succinate across the mitochondrial mem -
brane that is required during the mobilization of storage lipids via 
the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis ( Palmieri et al. 2008 ).
Transcriptomic data have supported a role for DIC in the NAD-ME 
cycle. Among C
4 
monocots, 2 members of the DIC family are ex -
pressed in a strongly bundle sheath–preferential manner in the 
NAD-ME subtype species P. virgatum ( Rao et al. 2016 ) but not in 
NADP-ME subtype species ( Chang et al. 2012 ; John et al. 2014 ; 
Emms et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 8B ). In dicots, DIC1 shows significantly bundle 
sheath–preferential expression in the NAD-ME subtype C
4 
species G. 
gynandra ( Aubry et al. 2014 ), and this gene is significantly upregu -
lated compared with its close C
3 
relative G. spinoza ( Bräutigam 
et al. 2011 ). The expression patterns above for DIC correlate with 
the expression of genes encoding the mitochondrial Phosphate 
Carrier, a P
i
/H
+ 
symporter ( Hamel et al. 2004 ). Together, this suggests 
a mechanism by which malate import (and P
i 
export) through DIC is 
coupled to the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane 
via H
+ 
and P
I 
symport through Phosphate Carrier ( Fig. 8C ).
Mitochondrial 2-OG transport in the C
4 
cycle: 
co-option of a multifunctional dicarboxylate 
exchanger to support aspartate transamination
As discussed above, the net import of aspartate to the mitochon -
dria of the bundle sheath cell also requires the uptake of 2-OG to 
support the trans-amination reaction catalyzed by aspartate ami -
no transferase. Candidates for this 2-OG uptake are the 
mitochondrial DTC transporters that catalyze the strict counter- 
exchange of dicarboxylates (including 2-OG, malate, OAA, succi -
nate) and tricarboxylates (including citrate, isocitrate) ( Taniguchi 
and Sugiyama 1996 ; Picault et al. 2002 ). The role for DTC transport -
ers in C
3 
plants has not been well characterized, although multiple 
hypotheses have been proposed ( Fig. 9A ). First, the capacity for ma -
late/OAA exchange means a redox valve function is possible 
( Picault et al. 2002 ). Second, the capacity for citrate exchange 
with OAA and/or malate could play a role in fatty acid elongation 
and isoprenoid synthesis ( Picault et al. 2002 ). Third, DTC, through 
its capacity to exchange various TCA cycle intermediates, may be 
involved in the direct export of 2-OG to support nitrogen assimila -
tion via the glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate amino -
transferase cycle ( Picault et al. 2002 ).
A role for DTC in facilitating mitochondrial 2-OG uptake in 
NAD-ME subtype C
4 
photosynthesis has been proposed, based 
on light-dependent, leaf bundle sheath–specific expression, and 
developmental regulation similar to other C
4 
cycle genes 
( Taniguchi and Sugiyama 1997 ; Aubry et al. 2014 ) ( Fig. 9B ). This 
is further supported by transcriptomic data, with DTC genes 
showing high, bundle sheath–specific expression in NAD-ME 
( Rao et al. 2016 ) but not in NADP-ME subtype C
4 
monocot species 
( Chang et al. 2012 ; John et al. 2014 ; Emms et al. 2016 ) ( Fig. 9C ). 
Thus, given their expression and known function in C
3 
plants, it 
is likely that mitochondrial DTC transporters perform the role of 
supplying 2-OG to support aspartate trans-amination as part of 
the NAD-ME C
4 
cycle.

Mitochondrial aspartate transport in the C
4 
cycle: 
co-option of a photorespiratory redox shuttle
While the DTC and DIC transporters discussed above are capable 
of moving dicarboxylates, none have been demonstrated to be 
capable of moving amino acids nor supporting the net flux of car -
bon through the NAD-ME subtype C
4 
cycle. Thus, the final piece in 
the puzzle of mitochondrial metabolite transport in NAD-ME sub -
type C
4 
photosynthesis is the net uptake of aspartate into mito -
chondria. Recently it has been shown that Plant Uncoupling 
Mitochondrial Proteins (PUMPs, also known as UCPs) are able to 
exchange amino acids (such as aspartate and glutamate), as 
well as dicarboxylates (such as malate and succinate) and other 
small compounds (such as sulfate, thiosulfate, and P
i
) ( Monné 
et al. 2018 ). Through a combination of biochemical/physiological 
assays and in vitro transport activity measurements, it was sug -
gested that UCPs in C
3 
plants may function as a redox valve to sup -
ply reducing equivalents from photorespiratory mitochondrial 
glycine decarboxylation to support peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate 
reductase ( Monné et al. 2018 ). This proposed role provides a 
molecular understanding of a known transfer of reducing equiva -
lents between mitochondria and peroxisomes in which glutamate 
and malate are transferred from mitochondria to peroxisomes, 
with aspartate and 2-OG moving in the opposite direction ( Dry 
et al. 1987 ) ( Fig. 10A ).
We propose here that the function of UCPs in the transport of 
amino acids and dicarboxylates makes them clear candidates 
for co-option into the NAD-ME subtype C
4 
cycle. Consistent with 
other transporters proposed to be involved in the NAD-ME C
4 
cycle 
above, UCP1 shows bundle sheath–preferential expression in the 
NAD-ME subtype C
4 
species P. virgatum ( Fig. 10B ) and G. gynandra
88 
and low expression in NADP-ME subtype C
4 
( Fig. 10B ).
A transport model for NAD-ME C
4 
photosynthesis
The combination of transport activities at the mitochondrial 
membrane discussed above enables the proposal of a molecular 
map for mitochondrial dicarboxylate transport in NAD-ME sub -
type C
4 
photosynthesis ( Fig. 10C ). Specifically, UCP facilitates the 
import of aspartate in exchange for glutamate produced by mito -
chondrial AspAT-mediated transamination of the aspartate and 
2-OG, which in turn is imported by DTC in exchange for malate ex -
port. Finally, malate must be reimported through DIC in exchange 
for P
i 
export, driven by the P
i 
gradient generated by P
i
:H
+ 
symport 
through PIC ( Fig. 10C ). Remarkably, this transport model was first 
proposed by Furbank et al. ( Furbank et al. 1990 ) before any of the 
transporters involved had been identified. Their insight was de -
rived from the observation that isolated P. miliaceum bundle 
sheath cells and chloroplasts carry out maximal O
2 
evolution 
only in the presence of a combination of aspartate, 2-OG, malate, 
and P
i 
( Furbank et al. 1990 ). The model was further supported by 
Taniguchi and Sugiyama after the initial characterization of 
DTC in a C
4 
plant ( Taniguchi and Sugiyama 1997 ). Now that can -
didate transporters capable of carrying out these reactions have 
been identified, it provides the first complete molecular map for 
transport in NAD-ME C
4 
photosynthesis and will enable molecular 
dissection of the cycle.
There are major gaps in our understanding of 
metabolite transport in C
4 
photosynthesis
Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the 
metabolite transporters of the C
4 
cycle. However, there are still sev -
eral important transport steps for which no known transporters 
have been shown to provide the required movement. For example, 
while most C
4 
species appear to have recruited the Na
+
-dependent 
BASS2 for pyruvate import into the mesophyll chloroplast, the 
transporter that facilitates the H
+
-dependent pyruvate uptake in 
the economically important Arundinelleae and Andropogoneae has 
yet to be discovered ( Aoki et al. 1992 ). Similarly, the transporters 
that facilitate malate uptake and pyruvate export in bundle sheath 
chloroplast of NADP-ME subtype C
4 
species are still unknown. The 
best evidence to date suggests that malate uptake in the majority of 
NADP-ME C
4 
species utilize a multi-step valve-like mechanism that 
is in part facilitated by members of the DCT subfamily ( Weissmann 
et al. 2016 ). However, the only efficient transport activity so far ob -
served for DCT subfamily transporters is the exchange of 4- and 
5-carbon dicarboxylates (e.g. OAA, malate, succinate, fumarate, 
2-OG) and amino acids (e.g. aspartate, glutamate) ( Day and Hatch 
1981 ; Renné et al. 2003 ; Taniguchi et al. 2004 ). Significant dicarbox -
ylate/amino acid unidirectional uptake has not been observed with 
DCTs from A. thaliana or maize ( Taniguchi et al. 2002 , 2004 ), and 
DCT from C
3 
spinach and C
4 
F. bidentis were shown not to exchange

The metabolite transporters of C

malate and pyruvate ( Renné et al. 2003 ). Thus, while DCTs are 
likely to be involved in the transport of malate across the bundle 
sheath chloroplast envelope, they cannot facilitate the net import 
of carbon that is required for the C
4 
cycle to function as a carbon- 
concentrating mechanism. Therefore, other transporters must 
play a role.
The existence of an as-yet-unidentified aspartate transporter 
(likely a cation:aspartate symporter) has been proposed to try to ex -
plain how malate is imported into the chloroplast ( Weissmann et al. 
2016 ). This is consistent with previous observations that malate- 
dependent pyruvate formation from wild-type maize bundle sheath 
cells or chloroplasts is stimulated by aspartate ( Chapman and 
Hatch 1979 ; Jenkins and Boag 1985 ). It is also plausible that there ex -
ists a separate transporter capable of either malate uptake (likely a 
cation:malate symporter) or simultaneous malate uptake and pyr -
uvate efflux that could provide this function. In the absence of a 
transporter capable of carrying out malate/pyruvate exchange, pyr -
uvate export is presumably facilitated by a separate pyruvate ex -
porter (likely a cation:pyruvate symporter). However, no such 
transporter is known in plants or other organisms. Insights may 
come from the identification of an as-yet-unknown transporter 
that facilitates pyruvate efflux from mitochondria discussed above 
( Le et al. 2021 ).
Advances in methods that could enable high throughput deter -
mination of transport activities of candidate transporters identified 
from transcriptomic data would substantially advance this search, 
particularly for pyruvate, which is difficult to analyse in assays 
that require reconstituted liposomes. For example, methods such 
as fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography-based 
thermostability assays ( Hattori et al. 2012 ), nano differential scan -
ning fluorimetry ( Gao et al. 2020 ), tryptophan fluorescence quench -
ing ( Yammine et al. 2019 ), or surface plasmon resonance ( Patching 
2014 ) could be used to accelerate screening of candidate transport -
ers for their ability to bind to specific substrates. Subsequent trans -
port validation could then be achieved using genetically encoded 
biosensors ( Ho and Frommer 2014 ) or radioactive in vivo uptake 
methods prior to kinetic characterization in proteoliposomes.
There is a pressing need to characterize C
4 
cycle 
transporters in C
4 
plants
Although many transporters capable of catalyzing the correct 
transport reactions required for C
4 
photosynthesis have been 
characterized in C
3 
species, only 1 (maize DCT) has been subject 
to physiological evaluation in C
4 
species ( Weissmann et al. 
2016 ). Thus, direct assessment of the exact role these transporters 
play in C
4 
photosynthesis is lacking. This creates several prob -
lems. Most importantly, the involvement of almost all the trans -
porters proposed to facilitate all C
4 
cycles are currently just 
hypotheses, with multiple working in opposite directions to those 
characterised in C
3 
plants or other eukaryotes. This lack of exper -
imental validation in C
4 
plants is likely masking complexities to 
the transport models and metabolic pathways, leading to misun -
derstandings concerning the operation of the C
4 
cycle. For exam -
ple, from initial transcriptomic studies it was assumed that 
transporters from the DCT family facilitate malate uptake into 
the chloroplast of NADP-ME species ( Chang et al. 2012 ). 
However, when these transporters were knocked out, malate 
was still taken up, albeit at a reduced rate, revealing that malate 
import into the bundle sheath chloroplast is more complex than 
first thought ( Weissmann et al. 2016 ). It is likely that other such 
hidden features of C
4 
photosynthesis will be revealed if other pro -
posed C
4 
cycle transporters are interrogated in C
4 
plants 
themselves. Continual advances in transformation, DNA synthe -
sis, genomic resources, and genome editing technologies make 
these experimental investigations more tractable, and these are 
a clear priority for C
4 
photosynthesis research. However, it may 
prove challenging to generate transporter loss-of-function lines 
in C
4 
plants if the resulting plants prove to be nonviable. 
Moreover, phenotypic evaluation may be complicated by the re -
quirement to grow plants at high CO
2 
concentrations.
Conclusion
C
4 
photosynthesis is one of the most fascinating examples of com -
plex convergent evolution in eukaryotic biology. Understanding 
how this convergent trait is manifest holds immense potential 
to help us understand how complexity evolves, how the world’s 
most productive photosynthetic pathway operates, and to provide 
a blueprint to enhance photosynthesis, reduce nitrogen require -
ments, and reduce water use in C
3 
crop plants. The identification 
of the missing transporters above and a detailed characterization 
of transporter function in C
4 
plants represent one of the biggest 
challenges in achieving these aims and is essential to realize the 
goal of engineering C
4 
photosynthesis into C
3 
plants to improve 
their yield.
