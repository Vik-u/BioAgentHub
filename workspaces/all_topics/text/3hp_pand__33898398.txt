Biological engineering of microorganisms to produce value-added chemicals is a
promising route to sustainable manufacturing. However, overproduction of metabolic
intermediates at high titer, rate, and yield from inexpensive substrates is challenging
in non-model systems where limited information is available regarding metabolic ﬂux
and its control in production conditions. Integrated multi-omic analyses of engineered
strains offers an in-depth look at metabolites and proteins directly involved in growth
and production of target and non-target bioproducts. Here we applied multi-omic
analyses to overproduction of the polymer precursor 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) in
the ﬁlamentous fungus Aspergillus pseudoterreus. A synthetic pathway consisting of
aspartate decarboxylase, beta-alanine pyruvate transaminase, and 3HP dehydrogenase
was designed and built for A. pseudoterreus . Strains with single- and multi-copy
integration events were isolated and multi-omics analysis consisting of intracellular and
extracellular metabolomics and targeted and global proteomics was used to interrogate
the strains in shake-ﬂask and bioreactor conditions. Production of a variety of co-
products (organic acids and glycerol) and oxidative degradation of 3HP were identiﬁed
as metabolic pathways competing with 3HP production. Intracellular accumulation of
nitrogen as 2,4-diaminobutanoate was identiﬁed as an off-target nitrogen sink that may
also limit ﬂux through the engineered 3HP pathway. Elimination of the high-expression
oxidative 3HP degradation pathway by deletion of a putative malonate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase improved the yield of 3HP by 3.4×after 10 days in shake-ﬂask culture.
This is the ﬁrst report of 3HP production in a ﬁlamentous fungus amenable to industrial
scale biomanufacturing of organic acids at high titer and low pH.

Pomraning et al. 3HP Production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus
INTRODUCTION
Since the industrial revolution, petroleum-based feedstocks have
been the primary source for production of fuels and chemicals.
However, their non-renewable nature and the detrimental eﬀects
of extractive practices have fueled a movement to produce
drop-in or alternative fuels and chemicals from renewable
feedstocks. A bioeconomy, based around the production of fuels
and chemicals from renewable biological feedstocks has been
proposed and supported as a way to improve the sustainability
of fuel and commodity chemical production. Building new
and modifying existing industries to produce the myriad of
chemicals currently derived from petrochemical feedstocks will
require extensive metabolic engineering of a wide variety
of bacteria, plants, and fungi and integration with catalytic
and thermochemical conversion processes to attain near-term
economic viability. To support this, a public Agile BioFoundry
has been established to eﬃciently engineer microorganisms for
the production of fuels and chemicals from renewable feedstocks1
(Hillson et al., 2019). The breadth of capabilities available
to Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) from engineered
organisms at a dedicated biofoundry enables a system-wide
examination of engineered pathways and a deeper understanding
of metabolic capability in non-model bioconversion hosts. An
emphasis on maximizing the eﬃciency of multi-omic analyses
during the Test and Learn portions of the DBTL cycle will
expedite the arrival of a functioning bioeconomy by allowing
strain and bioprocess development to overcome challenges
associated with the complexity of metabolic systems.
Of interest to supporting a sustainable bioeconomy are
biological production of chemicals that can be polymerized to
produce biobased and biodegradable plastics. One such chemical,
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) can be used to produce polymers
directedly, such as poly-3HP , or more complex structures that
also incorporate 3-hydroxybutyric acid, 4-hydroxybutyric acid,
and/or lactic acid to produce polymers with altered physical
properties (Tripathi et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2015; Ren et al.,
2017). For drop-in to existing industrial processes, 3HP can be
dehydrated to produce acrylic acid (Decoster et al., 2013) which
has received commercial interest for biobased production of
acrylates from glycerol (BASF, 2014). 3HP is also a precursor for
carbon ﬁber via conversion to acrylonitrile and polymerization
to polyacrylonitrile, which can be used in standard industrial
processes to make carbon ﬁbers (Davey, 2018).
3HP is produced naturally by phototrophic bacteria in the
family Chloroﬂexaceae capable of CO 2 ﬁxation via the 3HP
cycle (Strauss and Fuchs, 1993; Klatt et al., 2007) as well
as chemotrophic Crenarchaeota via the 3HP/4HB cycle (Berg
et al., 2007). Enzymes from naturally occurring 3HP biosynthetic
pathways have been used to design 3HP production pathways
that route metabolic ﬂux through beta-alanine, malonyl-CoA, or
glycerol (Valdehuesa et al., 2013; Ji et al., 2018). Iterations of these
pathways have been engineered into a variety of yeast and bacteria
with notable successes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
both the malonyl-CoA (Kildegaard et al., 2016) and beta-alanine
1https://agilebiofoundry.org/
(Borodina et al., 2015) pathways have been established with
yields of 0.13 and 0.14 g/g 3HP from glucose. In bacteria
production of 3HP via the glycerol pathway has been particularly
successful with yields as high as 0.457 g/g 3HP directly from
glycerol with engineered Escherichia coli (Kim et al., 2020) and
0.51 g/g 3HP from glucose with engineered Corynebacterium
glutamicum which is also capable of converting xylose to
3HP (Chen et al., 2017). These examples demonstrate that
microorganisms can be engineered to produce 3HP at reasonably
high levels in laboratory conditions and further research will
continue to improve production eﬃciency toward levels needed
for economic viability. However, apart from C. glutamicum, the
organisms being engineered for 3HP production may not be
ideal hosts for bioconversion of lignocellulosic and low-cost
renewable feedstocks that are often composed of a spectrum
of organic compounds that model organisms may struggle to
metabolize. Further, production of 3HP as a free acid, rather than
its conjugate base may aid online or down-stream separation
processes. Filamentous fungi from the genus Aspergillus are
notable for their ability to produce organic acids such as citric
acid, malic acid, and itaconic acid at industrial scale and at a pH
that is well below the pKa = 4.5 of 3HP (Liu et al., 2017; Cairns
et al., 2018; Kuenz and Krull, 2018). To that end, we examined
utilization of Aspergillus pseudoterreus as a host for bioconversion
of sugars to 3HP through the beta-alanine pathway (Borodina
et al., 2015) because of its acid tolerance, high glycolytic ﬂux, and
ability to utilize a broad range of carbon and nitrogen sources
(Kuenz and Krull, 2018; Saha et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020).
Engineered strains were evaluated using multi-omics analyses to
understand the impacts of the introduced metabolic pathway and
identify targets for improvement of 3HP production.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strain Maintenance and Cultivation
Aspergillus pseudoterreus strain ATCC
R⃝ 32359TM was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, V A,
United States). All strains were maintained on complete medium
agar (CM) (Deng et al., 2020) and spore suspensions stored in
15% glycerol at –80 ◦C. Spore inoculum was grown on CM agar
plates for 5 days to produce conidia, which were harvested by
washing the plates with sterile 0.4% Tween 80 solution. For shake-
ﬂask experiments, 2E6 A. pseudoterreus spores were inoculated
in 50 mL minimal medium [MM; 100 g/L glucose, 2.36 g/L
(NH4)2SO4, 0.11 g/L KH 2PO4, 2.08 g/L MgSO 4.7H2O, 0.13 g/L
CaCl2.2H2O, 74 mg/L NaCl, 1.3 mg/L ZnSO 4.7H2O, 0.7 mg/L
MnCL2.4H2O, 5.5 mg/L FeSO 4.7H2O, 0.2 mg/L CuSO 4.5H2O,
adjusted to pH 3.4 with 5M KOH] adapted from Riscaldati
et al. (2000) in 250 mL shake-ﬂasks at 30 ◦C and 200 rpm in
an orbital shaker. For submerged stirred tank 20 L bioreactor
cultivation, 2E6 A. pseudoterreus spores were inoculated within
a 30-L Sartorius Biostat-C bioreactor ﬁlled to 20 L with MM at
30◦C. Impeller stir-rate was set at a constant rate of 100 rpm
until the pH dropped to 2.8 after which stir-rate was increased
to 400 rpm and pH maintained at 2.8 by online addition of 5M
KOH. For submerged stirred tank 0.5 L bioreactor cultivation,

Pomraning et al. 3HP Production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus
2E6 A. pseudoterreus spores were inoculated within 0.5 L Sixfors
bioreactors (Infors HT, Basel, Switzerland) ﬁlled to 0.45 L with
MM at 30 ◦C. Impeller stir-rate was set at a constant rate
of 200 rpm until the pH dropped to 2.8 after which stir-
rate was increased to 600 rpm and pH maintained at 2.8 by
online addition of 5M KOH. For both reactor scales air was
sparged at a constant rate of 0.4 vessel volumes/min. Sterile
broth samples were collected by ﬁltration through a 0.2 µm
ﬁlter and then frozen at –20 ◦C for analysis of sugar, nutrient,
and metabolite concentrations. Cell pellets were collected by
vacuum ﬁltration on 0.45 µm nylon Whatman ﬁlters and
washed with phosphate buﬀered saline. Cells were transferred
to Eppendorf tubes, ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at –80 ◦C. Mycelial dry cell weight at each time point was
determined by harvesting the mycelia on a pre-weighed ﬁlter
by vacuum ﬁltration and washing with 20 mL distilled water.
Subsequently, the dry weight was determined after freeze-drying
in a lyophilizer overnight.

pZD4025 to form pZD4028. pZD4028 was linearized with
EcoRV for chemical mediated protoplast transformation into
A. pseudoterreus (ATCC
R⃝ 32359TM) as previously described
(Deng et al., 2020) to construct strains ABF_004528_2
(cad:3HP+) and ABF_004528_6 (cad:3HP+, 3HP+).
Upstream and downstream regions of the candidate malonate
semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Ap ald6) were PCR ampliﬁed
from A. pseudoterreus genomic DNA using primer pairs
(5′-gcctataagcaaccgcctgtataaggaagagccttggtgctaacggc-3′/5′-gctg

ctcaacctactactgggc-3′). The four fragments were assembled using
NEBuilder
R⃝ HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB, Ipswitch,
MA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and transformed into strain ABF_004528_6 ( cad:3HP+, 3HP+)
using agrobacterium mediated transformation as previously
described (Michielse et al., 2008) to make strain ABF_008339
(cad:3HP+, 3HP+; 1Apald6).
Sample Preparation
TissueLyser II system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) 2 mL
trays were frozen at –20 ◦C overnight. Two 3 mm stainless steel
beads were added to 2 mL snap-cap centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) along with 0.5 mL H 2O and each fungus
piece. The tubes were placed inside the trays and they were then
set on the TissueLyser II system. The frozen samples were ground
for 2 min at 30 Hz until it reached a completely homogenized,
cold solution. To separate the protein and metabolites, 1 mL
cold (–20◦C) chloroform:methanol mix [prepared 2:1 (v/v)] was
pipetted into a chloroform compatible 2 mL Sorenson MulTI TM
SafeSealTM microcentrifuge tubes (Sorenson bioscience, Salt Lake
City, UT, United States) inside an ice-block. Then 200 µl of
the sample homogenate in water was added to the Sorenson
tube at a ratio of 1:5 sample:chloroform mix [2:1 (v/v)] and
vigorously vortexed. The sample was then placed in the ice block
for 5 min and then vortexed for 10 s followed by centrifugation at
10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4◦C. The upper water-soluble metabolite
phase and the lower lipid soluble phase were also collected into
the same vial for metabolomics analysis. The metabolite samples
were dried to complete dryness in a speed vac and then capped
and stored dry at –20 ◦C until analysis. The remaining protein
interphase had 1 mL of cold (–20 ◦C) pure methanol added,
vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min to remove the
chloroform and pellet the protein. The methanol supernatant was
decanted into waste and the pellet lightly dried in a fume hood
and then stored at –80◦C until protein digestion.
Protein Digestion
The protein interlayer pellet was digested by adding 200 µl of
an 8 nM urea solution to the protein pellets and vortexed into
solution. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, United States) was performed to determine
protein concentration. Following the assay, 10 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) was added to the samples and incubated at 60 ◦C for
30 min with constant shaking at 800 rpm. Reduced cysteine
residues were alkylated by adding 400 mM iodoacetamide
(Sigma-Aldrich) to a ﬁnal concentration of 40 mM and

incubating in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were
then diluted eightfold for preparation for digestion with 100 mM
NH4HCO3, 1 mM CaCl2 and sequencing-grade modiﬁed porcine
trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) was added to
all protein samples at a 1:50 (w/w) trypsin-to-protein ratio
for 3 h at 37 ◦C. Digested samples were desalted using a
4-probe positive pressure Gilson GX-274 ASPEC TM system
(Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI, United States) with Discovery C18
100 mg/1 mL solid phase extraction tubes (Supelco, St. Louis,
MO, United States), using the following protocol: 3 mL of
methanol was added for conditioning followed by 2 mL of 0.1%
triﬂouroacetic acid (TFA) in H2O. The samples were then loaded
onto each column followed by 4 mL of 95:5: H 2O:ACN, 0.1%
TFA. Samples were eluted with 1 mL 80:20 ACN:H2O, 0.1% TFA.
The samples were concentrated down to ∼100 µL using a Speed
Vac and a ﬁnal BCA was performed to determine the peptide
concentration, and then stored at –80◦C until usage.
Global Proteomics Analysis
Peptides digests were diluted to 0.1 µg/µL with nanopure water
for LC-MS/MS analysis. Five µL of samples were loaded onto in-
house packed reversed-phase capillary columns (70 cm ×75 µm
i.d.) with 3 µm Jupiter C18 particles. The separation was carried
out using a nanoAcquity HPLC system (Waters Corporation,
Milford, MA, United States) at room temperature. The mobile
phase A is 0.1% formic acid in water while the mobile phase B
is 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The elution was carried out
at 300 nL/min with the following gradient: 0–2 min 1% B; 2–
20 min 8% B; 20–75 min 12%B; 75–97 min 30%B; 97–100 min
45%; 100–105 95%; 105–110 min 95%; 110–140 min 1%. The
eluting peptides were directly analyzed using a Q Exactive HF
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in data-dependent
acquisition mode. Mass spectrometer settings were as following:
full MS (AGC, 3 ×106; resolution, 60,000; m/z range, 300–1800;
maximum ion time, 20 ms); MS/MS (AGC, 1 ×105; resolution,
15000; m/z range, 200–2000; maximum ion time, 100 ms; TopN,
12; isolation width, 2 Da; dynamic exclusion, 30.0 s; collision
energy, NCE 30).
All mass spectrometry data were searched using MS-GF +
(Kim and Pevzner, 2014) and MASIC (Monroe et al., 2008)
software. MS-GF +software was used to identify peptides by
scoring MS/MS spectra against peptides derived from the whole
protein sequence database. MASIC software was used to generate
the selected ion chromatographs (SICs) of all the precursors in
MSMS datasets and calculate their peak areas as abundance.
MASICResultsMerger2 was used to append the relevant MASIC
stats for each peptide hit result in MS-GF +. The MS-GF +data
were then ﬁltered based on 1% false discovery rate (FDR) and less
than 5-ppm mass accuracy to generate a list of qualiﬁed peptide-
hit results. The abundance of peptides was determined as the
highest peak area identiﬁed for the peptide within a sample.
Sample level quality was ensured by a robust Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to compute a robust Mahalanobis
distance (rMd) based on sample-level parameters (Matzke et al.,
2011). Peptides were also ﬁltered to remove those with inadequate
2https://omics.pnl.gov/software/masic-results-merger
data for statistics, either three samples with measured values
in one group or two values measured for subjects within two
distinct groups. The default for normalization is standard global
median centering to account for total abundance diﬀerences
between samples. A test was performed to assure that these
factors are not biases (Webb-Robertson et al., 2010). For this
dataset there was no bias detected and we utilized global
median centering (Callister et al., 2006). Protein quantiﬁcation
was performed with standard reference-based median averages
(Polpitiya et al., 2008; Matzke et al., 2013). Statistics were
performed with established standard methods (Webb-Robertson
et al., 2017). For time we utilized an ANOV A with a Dunnett’s
test to compare all time points back to the ﬁrst time point within
each strain. We also utilized a g-test with a Bonferonni correction
to identify qualitative markers both to compare strains or time
(Webb-Robertson et al., 2010).
Targeted Proteomics Analysis
Targeted Proteomics was performed via Liquid Chromatography
(LC) – Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) approach. 3–5
peptides per protein were initially selected based on either their
identiﬁcation in global proteomics or their SRM suitability scores
predicated by CONSeQuence (Eyers et al., 2011) and Prego
(Searle et al., 2015) software tools. All the peptides were further
blasted to ensure their uniqueness to target proteins in the
organism. Crude synthetic heavy isotope-labeled (e.g., 13C/15N
on C-terminal lysine and arginine) peptides were purchased
from New England Peptide (Gardner, MA, United States). Upon
receiving, the crude synthetic heavy peptides were mixed together
and diluted with 0.1% formic acid in 15% acetonitrile in water
to obtain a nominal concentration of 1.5 pmol/ µL for each
individual peptide. The heavy peptide mixture stock solution was
aliquoted and stored at –80◦C until further use.
To develop targeted proteomics assay, all the SRM precursor-
fragment ion pairs (i.e., transitions) were ﬁrst analyzed using LC-
SRM by spiking heavy peptides in test samples. 2–3 transitions
per peptide and 1–5 peptides per protein were selected in a ﬁnal
assay based on their LC performance, MS response, transition
interferences, and endogenous peptide detectability. Collision
energies of transitions were obtained using empirical equations
provided in Skyline software (MacLean et al., 2010).
For peptide samples, crude heavy peptide mixture stock
solution was spiked in the 0.25 µg/µL peptide samples at
a nominal concentration of 35 fmol/ µL for each peptide.
LC-SRM analysis utilized a nanoACQUITY UPLC
R⃝ system
(Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, United States) coupled
online to a TSQ Altis TM triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The UPLC
R⃝ system was equipped
with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 µm C18 column (100 µm
i.d. ×10 cm) and the mobile phases were (A) 0.1% formic acid
in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Two µL of
sample (i.e., 0.4 µg of peptides) were loaded onto the column and
separated using a 110-min gradient proﬁle as follows (min:ﬂow-
rate-µL/min:%B): 0:0.4:1, 6:0.6:1, 7:0.4:1, 9:0.4:6, 40:0.4:13,
70:0.4:22, 80:0.4:40, 85:0.4:95, 91:0.5:95, 92:0.5:95, 93:0.5:50,
94:0.5:95, 95:0.6:1, 98:0.4:1. The LC column is operated with
a temperature of 42 ◦C. The TSQ Altis TM triple quadrupole

Pomraning et al. 3HP Production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus
mass spectrometer was operated with ion spray voltages of
2100 ±100 V and a capillary inlet temperature of 350 ◦C.
Tube lens voltages were obtained from automatic tuning and
calibration without further optimization. Both Q1 and Q3 were
set at unit resolution of 0.7 FWHM and Q2 gas pressure was
optimized at 1.5 mTorr. The transitions were scanned with a
7 min retention time window and a cycle time of 0.8 s.
All the LC-SRM data were imported into Skyline software
and the peak boundaries were manually inspected to ensure
correct peak assignment and peak boundaries. Peak detection
and integration were determined based on two criteria: (1) the
same LC retention time and (2) approximately the same relative
peak intensity ratios across multiple transitions between the
light peptides and heavy peptide standards. The total peak area
ratios of endogenous light peptides and their corresponding
heavy isotope-labeled internal standards were then exported from
Skyline software as Ratio-to-Standard. For each peptide, the total
peak area ratios of individual samples were normalized to the
average total peak area ratio of all the samples.
Sample level quality was ensured by a robust Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to compute a robust Mahalanobis
distance (rMd) based on sample-level parameters (Matzke et al.,
2011). The default for normalization is standard global median
centering to account for total abundance diﬀerences between
samples. A test was performed to assure that these factors are
not biases (Webb-Robertson et al., 2010). For this dataset, we
utilized global median centering (Callister et al., 2006). Protein
quantiﬁcation was performed with standard reference-based
median averages (Polpitiya et al., 2008; Matzke et al., 2013).
Statistics included standard methods (Webb-Robertson et al.,
2017). For this speciﬁc dataset, we utilized an analysis of variance
(ANOV A) with Tukey’s adjustment to compare all strains to on
another within each time point. In the time-course study, we
utilized an ANOV A with a Dunnett’s test to compare all time
points back to the ﬁrst time point within each strain.
Global Intracellular Metabolomics
The stored metabolite extracts were completely dried under
speed-vacuum to remove moisture and chemically derivatized
as previously reported (Kim et al., 2015). Brieﬂy, the extracted
metabolites were derivatized by methoxyamination and
trimethylsilyation (TMS), then the samples were analyzed by
GC-MS. Samples were run in an Agilent GC 7890A using a HP-
5MS column (30 m×0.25 mm ×0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, United States) coupled with a single quadrupole
MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies). One microliter of sample
was injected into a splitless port at constant temperature of
250◦C. The GC temperature gradient started at 60 ◦C and hold
for 1 min after injection, followed by increase to 325 ◦C at a rate
of 10 ◦C/min and a 5-min hold at this temperature. Fatty acid
methyl ester standard mix (C8-28) (Sigma-Aldrich) was analyzed
in parallel as standard for retention time calibration. GC-MS
raw data ﬁles were processed using the Metabolite Detector
software (Hiller et al., 2009). Retention indices (RI) of detected
metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of a FAMEs
mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all
analyses after deconvolution. Metabolites were initially identiﬁed
by matching experimental spectra to a PNNL augmented
version of Agilent GC-MS metabolomics Library, containing
spectra and validated retention indices for over 850 metabolites.
Then, the unknown peaks were additionally matched with the
NIST17/Wiley11 GC-MS library. All metabolite identiﬁcations
and quantiﬁcation ions were validated and conﬁrmed to reduce
deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to
eliminate false identiﬁcations.
Quantiﬁcation of Extracellular
Metabolites
For quantiﬁcation of metabolites in the spent medium, samples
were diluted 1:20 and 20 µL of these diluted samples were
dried in a glass vial. Solutions ranging from 0 to 300 µg/mL
containing standards of organic acids of interest, including 3HP ,
were prepared and 20 µL of these in triplicate were dried to build
an external calibration curve. Derivatization protocol, analysis by
GC-MS and processing of the data was done as described above,
but the analysis was targeted to only the metabolites present
in the standard mixes. Calibration curves were established for
each of the standards in the mixture of organic acids. After
linear regression ﬁtting, concentration of the metabolites in the
spent medium samples was determined upon consideration of
the dilution factor. For HPLC, samples were analyzed using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a
Waters 2414 refractive index detector. A Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-
87H ion exclusion column (300 mm ×7.8 mm), heated to 65 ◦C
was used for analyte separation. Sulfuric acid (0.0045 M) was used
as eluent at a ﬂow rate of 0.55 mL/min. Extracellular metabolite
quantities were used as boundary constraints for parsimonious
ﬂux balance analysis (pFBA) using OptFlux (Vilaca et al., 2018)
with Aspergillus niger genome scale metabolic model iJB1325
(Brandl et al., 2018).
RESULTS
Design and Build to Establish 3HP
Production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus
Production of 3HP in fungi has been explored in a number
of species including Pichia pastoris (Zhou et al., 2011),
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Takayama et al., 2018), and via
a variety of pathways in S. cerevisiae (Borodina et al.,
2015; Kildegaard et al., 2016). However, to our knowledge
3HP production has not been explored in ﬁlamentous fungi.
Aspergillus species, in particular, are notable for their ability
to produce commodity chemicals at low pH which is valuable
for the production of free acids. We chose A. pseudoterreus
as a ﬁlamentous fungal host in which to establish 3HP
production due to its demonstrated ability to produce and
tolerate high quantities of itaconic acid at low pH (Okabe
et al., 2009). The beta-alanine production pathway ( Figure 1A),
originally demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (Borodina et al., 2015),
was recapitulated for A. pseudoterreus by codon optimizing
the aspartate-1-decarboxylase ( pand), beta-alanine pyruvate
transaminase ( bapat) and 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase

E. coli respectively; and expressing them under the control of
high-expression gpdA and enoA promoters ( Figure 1B ). The
major product secreted by A. pseudoterreus during industrial
fermentations is itaconic acid (Lockwood and Nelson, 1946).
To eliminate production of itaconic acid, the beta-alanine
pathway overexpression construct was targeted to thecis-aconitic
acid decarboxylase ( cad1) locus (Deng et al., 2020) to allow
redistribution of metabolic ﬂux elsewhere (Figure 1B). Screening
of transformants identiﬁed a transgenic strain with a single copy
of the synthetic pathway integrated at the cad1 locus (strain
ABF_004528_2; cad:3HP+) and a strain with one copy of the
synthetic pathway integrated at the cad1 locus and a second copy
of the pathway that integrated elsewhere in the genome (strain
ABF_004528_6; cad:3HP+, 3HP +). Deletion of cad1 (strain
ABF_002234) eliminated itaconic acid production as previously
described (Deng et al., 2020). Overexpression of the beta-alanine
pathway established 3HP production in A. pseudoterreus while a
second copy of the biosynthetic pathway enabled nearly twice the
yield of extracellular 3HP (Figure 2B).
Test/Learn; Multi-Omics Analysis of 3HP
3HP producing strains with single and multi-copy integration
of the beta-alanine 3HP pathway were selected and compared
to a cad1 parental strain during an 8-day production period
in shake ﬂasks. Flasks were harvested at 2-day intervals and
samples collected for intracellular and extracellular metabolomics
as well as global and targeted proteomics. In total, global
proﬁling detected 4,674 proteins, while targeted proteomics
quantiﬁed 79 proteins involved in central carbon metabolism.
Nine extracellular metabolites were absolutely quantiﬁed while
320 intracellular metabolites were detected, 122 of which were
structurally identiﬁed (Figure 2).
Individual metabolites and proteins were assessed to identify
metabolic nodes and pathways that are perturbed in Aspergillus
strains engineered for 3HP production. The most strongly
perturbed proteins and metabolites identiﬁed are directly
involved in 3HP production as intermediates to the biosynthetic
pathway. In the strain with the synthetic 3HP pathway integrated
at multiple locations in the genome, we detected 1.66 ±0.13×
as much of the three heterologous proteins ( TcPAND, BcBAPAT,
and EcHPDH) ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, the intracellular levels
of beta-alanine and 3HP are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the
engineered strains suggesting that the production of extracellular
3HP is not transport limited, nor is the ﬂux toward 3HP limited
by either of these reactions. The fact that aspartate is present
at a somewhat higher level in the single-copy strain suggests
that ﬂux through Aspartate 1-decarboxylase may be the limiting
step in the pathway.
The engineered 3HP biosynthetic route from pyruvate
involves a series of balanced transamination reactions (alanine
transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and the introduced
beta-alanine pyruvate transaminase; Figure 1A) that under ideal
conditions cycle nitrogen between alanine, glutamate, aspartate,
and beta-alanine. Establishment and increase in expression
level of the 3HP biosynthetic pathway did not signiﬁcantly alter
the alanine, glutamate, or aspartate pool sizes though they did
tend to decrease in concentration. The beta-alanine pool size
substantially increased (148 ×– 249 ×higher from day 2 to
8) with establishment of the pathway but was not signiﬁcantly
altered by higher expression level. In addition to beta-alanine,
we found that the pool size of 2,4-diaminobutanoate is
substantially increased (41 ×–131 ×higher from day 2 to
8) with establishment of the pathway. Metabolic pathways
that produce 2,4-diaminobutanoate are not annotated in
Aspergillus species. We therefore examined the proteome
for up-regulated transaminases capable of producing 2,4-
diaminobutanoate from substrates that are enriched or
suspected to be high-ﬂux in the engineered strains. The
most signiﬁcantly up-regulated enzyme in the engineered

strains is the 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase Ap uga1.
If Ap uga1also functions promiscuously with aspartate-
semialdehyde as a substrate ( Figure 2C), 2,4-diaminobutanoate
would be produced rather than 4-aminobutanoate (predicted
reaction: aspartate-semialdehyde + glutamate ↔ alpha-
ketoglutarate +2,4-diaminobutanoate). It is also possible that
BcBAPAT, overexpressed as part of the engineered 3HP pathway,
is promiscuous and produces 2,4-diaminobutanoate with
aspartate-semialdehyde as a substrate (predicted reaction:
aspartate-semialdehyde + alanine ↔ pyruvate + 2,4-
diaminobutanoate). We did not detect 2,4-diaminobutanoate
extracellularly suggesting that this by-product of the engineered
pathway accumulates as an intracellular nitrogen sink
and may compete with nitrogen recycling necessary for
high-yield 3HP production.
Test/Learn; 3HP Scale-Up
To assess performance changes during scale-up, the highest
producing 3HP strain from shake-ﬂask experiments ( cad:3HP+,
3HP+) was cultured in a 30 L bioreactor. Oﬀ-gas, biomass, and
targeted extracellular metabolite concentrations were monitored
to provide boundary constraints for parsimonious ﬂux balance
analysis (pFBA) (Vilaca et al., 2018). During bioreactor
cultivation, biomass and CO 2 were the main products during
the ﬁrst 2 days of cultivation with CO 2 production peaking at
hour 44. Production of 3HP and glycerol began early during the
exponential growth phase of the culture and prior to peak CO 2
production. In contrast, production of organic acids (aconitic
acid, isocitric acid, citric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and malic
acid) began later when biomass production had slowed and
become a near-linear process ( Figure 3 ). This suggests that
production of 3HP via the beta-alanine pathway is primarily a
growth linked process, and as such, scale-up requirements may
be very diﬀerent than bioprocesses optimized for production of
TCA-cycle derived organic acids in Aspergillus species.
Production of extracellular 3HP in bioreactor conditions
reached a maximum titer of 0.69 g/L, considerably less than
in shake-ﬂasks, at hour 67 and then declined steadily to a
ﬁnal titer of 0.17 g/L. Follow-up experiments where exogenous
3HP was incubated in comparable conditions without the
presence of a fungus or with an A. pseudoterreus strain not
engineered for 3HP production demonstrated that 3HP is stable
in acidic culture conditions and degraded biotically ( Figure 4B).
Production of 3HP began tapering oﬀ at the on-set of organic acid
production suggesting the pathway involved in 3HP degradation
is activated during the transition from growth to organic acid
production stage.
We examined these results further within the context
of metabolic model iJB1325, constructed for the related
fungus Aspergillus niger (Brandl et al., 2018) and modiﬁed
by the addition of reactions encoding beta-alanine pyruvate
transaminase (beta-alanine + pyruvate ↔ malonate
semialdehyde + alanine), 3-hydroxypropionic acid
dehydrogenase (malonate semialdehyde + NADPH ↔ 3-
hydroxypropionic acid +NADP+), and associated transport
reactions and drains. Consumption and production rates for
glucose, CO 2, 3HP , aconitic acid, isocitric acid, citric acid,
alpha-ketoglutaric acid, malic acid, and glycerol were used to
constrain the model for pFBA. We found that the model is able to
recapitulate the slow growth of A. pseudoterreus observed in the
bioreactor but that all consumed 3HP is secreted as beta-alanine
regardless of objective function. Within the metabolic network,
3HP can be reversibly metabolized to beta-alanine, but due to
irreversibility of aspartate 1-decarboxylase (aspartate →beta-
alanine +CO2) and the energy requirement to metabolize excess
beta-alanine through the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway,

Pomraning et al. 3HP Production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus
it must be secreted under steady-state. However, extracellular
beta-alanine was not observed in shake-ﬂask or bioreactor
cultures. This suggests that existing pathway(s) to metabolize
3HP are not represented within the metabolic model.
In bacteria pathways have been identiﬁed to directly
metabolize 3HP via a reductive route to propionyl-CoA
(Schneider et al., 2012) or an oxidative route to malonate
semialdehyde, essentially the reverse of the ﬁnal reaction step
of the metabolic pathway deployed here (Zhou et al., 2014).
Malonate semialdehyde is then degraded to acetyl-CoA by
malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Talfournier et al., 2011).
In the fungus Candida albicans, 3HP is degraded by the oxidative
pathway described above by the enzymes Hpdhp and Ald6p
(Otzen et al., 2014). Genes encoding enzymes homologous to
the oxidative 3HP degradation pathway were identiﬁed by BlastP
in A. pseudoterreus. The best BlastP hit for Ald6p ( E-value 2E-
114) is among the most signiﬁcantly up-regulated genes during
production phase ( p < 1E-7 from days 4 to 8) in shake-
ﬂasks in strains engineered for 3HP production while the best
BlastP hit for Hpdhp ( E-value 8E-34) was not detected by
global proteomics.
It is expected that both the native 3HP dehydrogenase
(Aphpd1) and the overexpressed version from E. coli (hpdh) are
reversible and it is therefore unlikely that we could eliminate
3HP degradation while retaining the engineered pathway. We
therefore focused on elimination of the competing degradation
pathway at the point of malonate semialdehyde by deleting
the putative malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Apald6). In
shake-ﬂasks the yield of 3HP is improved by 3.4 ×in the Apald6
mutant (Figure 4C) conﬁrming the presence and impact of this
competing pathway in A. pseudoterreus.
The 1Apald6 and parent strains were then scaled-up to
0.5 L in bioreactors to re-evaluate 3HP production with pH
control and improved aeration ( Figure 5 ). By day seven the
parent strain had accumulated 0.27 ± 0.10 g/L 3HP while
yield was improved by 3.3 ×to 0.88 ±0.11 g/L 3HP in the
Apald6 mutant. We did not observe actively decreasing 3HP
in shake-ﬂask or small-scale bioreactor experiments as we did
in the 20 L bioreactor, but improved yield suggests that ﬂux
toward acetyl-CoA is a major competitor with ﬂux toward 3HP
from malonate semialdehyde. At 0.5 L scale the rate of CO 2
evolution was slower while higher levels of glycerol and erythritol
were accumulated. The major product during cultivation in the
20L bioreactor, aconitic acid, was not observed in the 0.5 L
bioreactors supporting the hypothesis that a shift to organic acid
production coincides with loss of 3HP. The predicted reaction
catalyzed by malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.27;
Figure 4A) was added to the metabolic model. This modiﬁcation
eliminates production of unobserved metabolites during pFBA
and improves the consistency of the model with empirical
observations from bioreactor and shake-ﬂask cultivations.
DISCUSSION
Biological engineering of microorganisms is a promising
route to sustainable manufacturing of fuels and chemicals
that are currently derived from the petroleum industry.
Here we focused on engineering an acidophilic ﬁlamentous
fungal host, A. pseudoterreus , for conversion of sugars
to the polymer precursor 3HP. Production of 3HP using
A. pseudoterreus is possible in acidic conditions at a pH of
2–3 where 3HP is primarily in the protonated free-acid form,
potentially reducing the cost of downstream separations.
Overexpression of a synthetic pathway that has been shown
to function in yeast (Borodina et al., 2015) demonstrated
that production of 3HP is feasible using A. pseudoterreus
but initial yield was poor. Understanding low productivity is
challenging in non-model systems where limited information
is available regarding metabolic ﬂux and its control. Here we
applied multi-omic analyses of engineered A. pseudoterreus
strains to generate a systems-level snapshot of metabolites
and proteins involved in 3HP production and metabolism
as a whole. This approach quantiﬁed the eﬀect of initial
and increased expression level of the 3HP pathway on
the bioconversion host and identiﬁed pathways competing
with 3HP production.
Establishment of the beta-alanine pathway for 3HP
biosynthesis had a greater overall eﬀect on metabolism
than increased expression level of the pathway and resulted
in substantially increased intracellular pools of beta-alanine,
2,4-diaminobutanoate, and 3HP and up-regulation of malonate-
semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Ap ald6), enzymes involved
in 4-aminobutanoate (GABA) degradation to succinate
(Apuga1, Ap uga2), and genes that may be involved in
metabolism of 3HP pathway intermediates through a CoA
bound intermediate (Ap suc5, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA
transferase; Ap adh11, hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase;
ApcoaT, acyl-CoA:carboxylate-CoA transferase; Ap ahd2,
aldehyde dehydrogenase; Ap acat1, keto-acyl-CoA thiolase; and
Apacat2, acyl-CoA thiolase), similar to the 3HP/4HB CO 2
ﬁxation cycle described in archaea (Berg et al., 2007).
The GABA degradation response to the 3HP pathway ties
nitrogen and carbon metabolism together through succinate.
In yeast, uga1 and uga2 are up-regulated in response to the
presence of GABA (Ramos et al., 1985), however we did
not detect a signiﬁcant impact on the intracellular GABA
pool size in response to the presence of the 3HP pathway.
4-hydroxybutanoate (GHB) was also accumulated in the
engineered strains ( Supplementary File 1 ). In yeast, there is
evidence to support the presence of a succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase to produce GHB (Bach et al., 2009) but not for the
reverse reaction catalyzed by GHB dehydrogenase (Mekonnen
and Ludewig, 2016), though Aspergillus species with a larger
genome may catalyze this reaction. Elucidation of the genes
responsible in fungi would aid in understanding the eﬀect
of 3HP on GABA and GHB metabolism. It is likely that
accumulation of 2,4-diaminobutanoate is a direct result of
increased Ap uga1 expression ( Figure 2 ), with the proposed
precursor aspartate semialdehyde being supplied by an enhanced
aspartate pool through the activity of aspartate kinase and
aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, though neither enzyme
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressed in response to the presence
of the 3HP pathway (Supplementary File 1).

the standard deviation from three replicates.
Extracellular metabolomics during bioreactor cultivation
revealed that 3HP is produced and then metabolized at the
onset of organic acid production. This led us to search for
metabolic pathways involved in catabolism of 3HP , which are
poorly characterized in fungi. During shake-ﬂask cultivation the
methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (g153; Ap ald6) is
strongly up-regulated at all times in the engineered strains.
This enzyme, normally involved in branched-chain amino acid
degradation, has been implicated in 3HP metabolism in bacteria
(Zhou et al., 2014; Arenas-Lopez et al., 2019) and the yeast
C. albicans (Otzen et al., 2014) by also acting as a malonate-
semialdehyde dehydrogenase and diverting ﬂux toward acetyl-
CoA rather than 3HP. Here we deleted a putative malonate-
semialdehyde dehydrogenase Ap ald6 and found that 3HP yield
was drastically improved ( Figure 4 ). Reductive degradation of
3HP via propanoyl-CoA synthase has also been demonstrated
in bacteria (Schneider et al., 2012), and while homologs of
the enzymes involved are not readily identiﬁable in fungi, we
have identiﬁed a variety of signiﬁcantly up-regulated enzymes
that may be directly involved in alternative 3HP assimilation
pathways. Further genetic characterization will reveal the
metabolic repertoire that fungi express to metabolize 3HP.
Multi-omic technologies oﬀer a promising route to systematic
analysis of bioconversion processes and identiﬁcation of targets
for improvement of metabolic ﬂux. The results in this study
demonstrate that 3HP production can be eﬀectively improved
by application of multi-omic analyses to further our system
level understanding of genetically engineered A. pseudoterreus .
However, extracellular metabolomics in shake-ﬂasks and
bioreactor scale-up revealed a wide variety of co-products being

produced at levels higher than that of 3HP. These co-
products compete metabolically with production of 3HP and
contaminate the desired end-product, making separations
impractical. Improvement of 3HP production inA. pseudoterreus
will require minimization of these co-products either through
growth optimization or further metabolic engineering.
