Abstract 
The enzymatic recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be a promising approach to tackle the problem of 
plastic waste. The thermostability and activity of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes are still insufficient for practical application. 
Pretreatment of PET waste is needed for bio-recycling. Here, we analyzed the degradation of PET films, packages, and 
bottles using the newly engineered cutinase Cut190. Using gel permeation chromatography and high-performance 
liquid chromatography, the degradation of PET films by the Cut190 variant was shown to proceed via a repeating 
two-step hydrolysis process; initial endo-type scission of a surface polymer chain, followed by exo-type hydrolysis to 
produce mono/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate and terephthalate from the ends of fragmented polymer molecules. 
Amorphous PET powders were degraded more than twofold higher than amorphous PET film with the same weight. 
Moreover, homogenization of post-consumer PET products, such as packages and bottles, increased their degrada-
bility, indicating the importance of surface area for the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET. In addition, it was required to 
maintain an alkaline pH to enable continuous enzymatic hydrolysis, by increasing the buffer concentration (HEPES, pH 
9.0) depending on the level of the acidic products formed. The cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium chlo-
ride promoted PET degradation via adsorption on the PET surface and binding to the anionic surface of the Cut190 
variant. The Cut190 variant also hydrolyzed polyethylene furanoate. Using the best performing Cut190 variant (L136F/
Q138A/S226P/R228S/D250C-E296C/Q123H/N202H/K305del/L306del/N307del) and amorphous PET powders, more 
than 90 mM degradation products were obtained in 3 days and approximately 80 mM in 1 day.
Key points 
1. The increased surface area of PET promotes its hydrolysis by Cut190, supporting the surface erosion mechanism 
by a two-step process (endo-type scission of a polymer chain and exo-type hydrolysis of depolymerized frag -
ments).
2. Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride functioned as a binding module between Cut190 and PET surface, show -
ing the higher hydrolysis rate at 65 °C than at 70 °C in the absence of the detergent.

Introduction
Of the 6300  million tons of plastic waste generated 
between 1950 and 2015, only 9% was recycled (Geyer 
et  al. 2017). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of 
the major plastics used worldwide and its global pro -
duction is amounted to 82  million metric tons per year 
(Singh et  al. 2021). Historically, PET had been consid -
ered recalcitrant to biodegradation, due to the pres -
ence of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid terephthalate in 
PET, which confers a high glass transition temperature 
(Tg) (75–80 °C in air but lowered to 65–70 °C in water), 
thereby requiring a PET hydrolase with high thermosta -
bility and activity at 70  °C for degradation (Kawai et  al. 
2019; Thomsen et al. 2022). Since the first report on PET 
hydrolase from a thermophilic actinomycete, Thermobi -
fida fusca (Müller et al. 2005), many PET hydrolases and 
their degradation abilities have been documented (Kawai 
2021). However, high-level candidate degraders with the 
ability to produce degradation products such as mono/
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET/BHET) and 
terephthalate (TPA) on an industrial scale are limited 
and need further approaches to design efficient PET 
hydrolases as well as to achieve ultra-high-throughput 
screening from novel resources (Wei et al. 2022). Among 
already known candidates, cutinases from thermophilic 
actinomycetes (T. fusca, T. cellulosilytica and Saccha -
romonospora viridis) (Wei et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2022; 
Emori et al. 2020), a leaf-branch compost metagenome-
derived cutinase (LCC) (most probably derived from 
Chloroflexi species; Xi et al. 2021) (Tournier et al. 2020; 
Zeng et  al. 2022) and a thermophilic fungus cutinase 
from Humicola insolens (commercialized) (Castro et  al. 
2019) have been reported to possess a thermostabil -
ity at more than 70 °C and to accumulate high millimo -
lar level of degradation products. Tournier et  al. (2020) 
reported an efficient process for PET recycling, based 
on two strategies using amorphized and particulate PET 
with engineered variants of the LCC. Most recently, a 
novel PET hydrolase was cloned from a compost metage-
nome (Sonnendecker et  al. 2022) and its variant indi -
cated the comparable activity to the LCC variant (Pfaff  
et al. 2022). In addition, PET hydrolases are cloned even 
from human saliva metagenome (Eiamthong et al. 2022). 
Thermostable mutants of PETase from mesophilic Ide -
onella sakaiensis (Yoshida et  al. 2016) have been docu -
mented so far. HotPETase attained the highest Tm value 
of 82.5 °C and showed comparative activity at 60–70 °C 
to the LCC variant (Bell et al. 2022). On the other hand, 
3. The best performing Cut190 variant produced more than 90 mM degradation products at 63 °C in 3 days and 
approximately 80 mM at 65 °C in one day, using amorphous PET powders. Additionally, polyethylene furanoate 
was highly hydrolyzed at 63 °C in 3 days by the Cut190 variant.

FAST-PETase with Tm value of 67.1 °C reported the bet -
ter performance at 50  °C, compared to LCC and its 
variant (Lu et al. 2022). We isolated a thermophilic actin-
omycete, S. viridis AHK190, from compost and cloned 
a cutinase-like enzyme, Cut190, possessing the unique 
feature that the thermostability and activity are con -
trolled by  Ca2+, in a concentration-dependent manner 
(Kawai et al. 2014). The increase in Cut190 thermostabil -
ity by  Ca2+ is attributed to the increased enthalpy change, 
which is partially compensated by the increased entropy 
change (Inaba et al. 2019). The three major  Ca2+-binding 
sites of Cut190/S226P/R228S (Cut190*) were determined 
by X-ray crystallography (Numoto et  al. 2018), and the 
role of each  Ca2+-binding site was determined by site-
directed mutagenesis (Oda et  al. 2018). The introduc -
tion of a new disulfide bond into one of the  Ca2+-binding 
sites contributed to an increase in the melting tempera -
ture (Tm) value and PET-hydrolyzing activity of the Cut 
190* variant (Oda et  al. 2018). In addition, the deletion 
of the three C-terminal amino acids of Cut190* further 
increased its thermal stability (Senga et  al. 2020). These 
findings indicate that Cut190 variants can be used to effi -
ciently hydrolyze PET.
As described previously (Kawai et al. 2019, 2020), PET 
hydrolysis is highly dependent on the physicochemi -
cal properties of PET, as well as the activity and ther -
mostability of PET hydrolases. It is therefore important 
to understand the mechanism of enzymatic PET degra -
dation and develop efficient hydrolysis processes with 
highly thermostable and active hydrolases and PET pre-
processing. In this study, from the analysis of the mass 
distribution of PET and degradation products, we veri -
fied the catalytic mechanism of PET hydrolase as surface 
erosion. Based on the presumed degradation pattern of 
PET (surface erosion), we attempted to process PET 
plastics (films, packages, and bottles) by micronization 
to expand the surface area, thereby making PET mate -
rials readily degradable by PET hydrolases. Addition -
ally, a cationic surfactant was employed to increase the 
enzyme activity at a lowered temperature (65  °C) than 
at 70  °C (the optimal temperature in the absence of the 
surfactant). Meanwhile, we introduced additional muta -
tions on the Cut190 variants reported earlier (Senga et al. 
2020; Emori et al. 2020), indicating the novel insights into 
the mutational points. It is noteworthy that the Cut190 
variant can hydrolyze polyethylene furanoate, a possible 
PET alternative.
Materials and methods
Materials
A 0.25-mm thick film of amorphous PET (PET-GF) was 
obtained from Goodfellows Cambridge, Ltd. (Tokyo, 
Japan). The PET package (approximately 0.6-mm thick; 
PET-S) for PC peripherals (Sanwa Supply Inc., Okayama, 
Japan) (PET-S) was also used for degradation tests, like 
the material used in previous studies (Oda et  al. 2018; 
Sulaiman et  al. 2014). Amorphous PET films (NOACR -
YSTAL V and NOACRYSTAL R) and PET bottle flakes 
were kindly supplied by RP TOPLA Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 
All the films, post-consumer bottles, and packages were 
cut into pieces (approximately 5  mm × 5  mm) and fur -
ther homogenized in water using a homogenizer (Phy -
scotron NS-20CG/20P , Microtec Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) 
(PET suspension). The conditions for homogenization 
were below 14,500 rpm for 90 s, which was repeated 50 
times, using appropriate amounts of PET samples (0.3–
0.5 g) per 15 ml of Milli-Q water in a 50 ml Falcon tube 
(for particle sizes, see Additional file  1: Fig. S1). Amor -
phous PET pellets (raw materials used for processing into 
various PET products) were milled into powder particles, 
(i) using the Cryogenic Sample Crusher JFC-300 (Japan 
Analytical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after pre-
freezing in liquid nitrogen (powder 1), or (ii) first with 
Cutting Mill SM2000 and then with Ultra Centrifugal 
Mill ZM200 (Vender Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 
after pre-freezing in liquid nitrogen (powder 2), or (iii) 
with Wonder Blender WB-1 (Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd., 
Japan) without pre-freezing (powder 3) (for particle sizes, 
see Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The physical characteristics 
of the films, packages, and powder forms were character -
ized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Addi-
tional file 1: Table S1). BHET was purchased from Tokyo 
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). MHET was 
synthesized as previously described (Oda et  al. 2018). 
Polyethylene furanoate (PEF) was synthesized, accord -
ing to the method described by Pellis et al. (2016) (Addi -
tional file  1: Scheme S1). The molecular weights of PET 
and PEF were measured using gel permeation chroma -
tography (GPC), on a Prominence LC system (Shimadzu 
Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an RI detector 
using hexafluoroisopropanol as the mobile phase at 40 °C 
with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The sample was dissolved 
in the mobile phase, filtered through a 0.5 µm-pore size 
membrane, and 20 μl of each sample was applied to two 
columns of TSK gel GMHHR-H(S) (7.8 mm ID × 30 cm; 
Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The molecular 
weights were calibrated using the polymethylmeth -
acrylate standards. Other chemicals were obtained from 
commercial sources.
Site‑directed mutagenesis and expression and purification 
of mutant enzymes
Cut190*/Cut190** mutants used in this study are listed 
in Table  1. The variants were generated using site-
directed mutagenesis as described previously (Oda et al. 
2018; Senga et al. 2020; Emori et al. 2020), and the gene 
Page 4 of 15Kawai et al. AMB Express          (2022) 12:134 
sequences encoding Cut190**SS/L136F/Q138G and 
Cut190**SS/L136F/Q138G/F255I were synthesized by 
GenScript Japan Ltd. (Tokyo). The PreScission protease 
hydrolysis site was introduced just after the N-terminal 
polyhistidine tag in all the variants. All the genes were 
ligated into pQE80L and expressed in Escherichia coli 
Rosetta-gami B(DE3), and the enzyme variants were 
purified, as described previously (Senga et  al. 2020; 
Emori et al. 2020). To remove the polyhistidine-tag, Pre -
Scission protease (Turbo 3C, Accelagen, San Diego, CA, 
USA or HRV3C, Takara, Shiga, Japan) was added to the 
purified enzyme with a polyhistidine-tag and incubated 
at 4  °C for 16  h, after which the protein was purified 
using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany) and a HiTrap Q FF column (Cytiva, Marlbor -
ough, MA, USA), as described previously (Senga et  al. 
2020; Emori et  al. 2020). The T m value of each variant 
was determined by measuring the intensity change in the 
circular dichroism signal at 222 nm, as described previ -
ously (Oda et al. 2018). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that 
the purities of the enzymes were greater than 90%. The 
protein concentration was spectrophotometrically deter -
mined at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 
4.02 ×  104  M−1  cm−1.
Degradation tests of PET and PEF samples
The reaction mixture for PET hydrolysis contained 
100 mM HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 8.5 and 9.0), 2.5 mM 
 CaCl2, 24%  glycerol, and approximately 2  μM Cut190* 
derivative. PET films were cut into pieces of 6  mm ∅ 
and incubated in a 1-ml reaction mixture. Appropriate 
amounts of PET suspension or PET powder were also 
used, in addition to films. Incubation was performed 
at different temperatures (63–70  °C) with shaking at 
110  rpm. Aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction 
mixture supernatant at different intervals, diluted with 
the same volume of methanol, and their absorbance at 
240  nm was measured. Degradation products such as 
BHET, MHET, and TPA were confirmed using high-per -
formance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as described 
previously (Hantani et  al. 2018), with monitoring at 
240 nm. The amounts of MHET and TPA produced in the 
reaction mixture were calculated from their respective 
standard curves. BHET was detected in trace amounts. 
The photometric absorption at 240  nm showed a good 
correlation with the HPLC measurements at 240  nm, 
although the values from absorbance were 5–10% higher 
than those obtained from HPLC (Additional file  1: 
Table S2). Therefore, absorption at 240 nm was used for 
general measurements of the reaction products.
The PEF samples were used in powder form. The reac -
tion mixture (500 μl) contained 100 mM HEPES–NaOH 
buffer (pH 9.0), 2.5  mM  CaCl2, 24% glycerol, approxi -
mately 2  μM Cut190*SS, and approximately 10  mg of 
PEF. After incubation at 63  °C for 3  days with shaking, 
the reaction was stopped by adding the same volume of 
methanol and filtered as described above, and the fil -
trate was analyzed using HPLC with detection at 265 nm. 
2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDA; Waken Holdings Co., 
Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used as the standard.
The measurements were performed in duplicate or 
triplicate.
Results
Mechanism of PET degradation
The hydrolysis of PET is considered to proceed at ran -
dom via endo-type degradation (Eberl et al. 2009), which 
is expected to generate decreased molecular weights if 
degradation occurs for all molecules, as observed in poly-
vinyl alcohol degradation (Kawai & Hu 2009). However, 
no substantial change in molecular size was found with 
PET hydrolyzed by Cut190*SS (Fig.  1), although the deg -
radation rate was calculated to be over 30%. This suggests 
that only the PET molecules on the surface layer were

fragmented (surface erosion) (Müller et al. 2005; Müller 
2006; Ronqvist et al. 2009). Depolymerization only at the 
surface does not affect the molecular size of the bulky 
polymer, probably because the depolymerized small mol -
ecules readily move away from the surface, leaving the 
main PET body intact. HPLC analysis confirmed TPA 
and MHET as the major reaction products from PET, 
and only a trace amount of BHET was detected during 
the reaction time, as previously reported (Herrero Acero 
et al. 2011; Barth et al. 2016; Oda et al. 2018). Our pre -
vious results indicated that BHET is readily hydrolyzed 
to MHET and TPA by Cut190* (Hantani et al. 2018). As 
the release of HPLC-detectable products (BHET, MHET 
and TPA) was proportional to the reaction time and the 
total amount of products were well in accordance with 
the decrease in weight (Ronqvist et al. 2009; Kawai et al. 
2014), it is reasonable to assume that these products 
are mainly formed by the exo-type hydrolysis. Together, 
these findings suggest that PET depolymerization pro -
ceeds via surface erosion, in which the first endo-type 
hydrolysis occurs at random on the surface molecules, 
and then depolymerized products such as BHET, MHET, 
and TPA are produced by exo-type hydrolysis from the 
fragmented surface molecules. As the hydrolysis rate of 
MHET is far slower than that of BHET (Hantani et  al. 
2018), MHET persists longer than BHET; however, it is 
finally converted to TPA.
Factors affecting the degradability of PET
The extent of PET hydrolysis was affected by the nature 
and pH of the buffers used (Additional file  1: Fig. S3). As 
Cut190 requires  Ca2+ ions for its activation and stabili -
zation, phosphate buffer cannot be used. Among HEPES, 
bicine, and glycine–NaOH buffers at pH 9.0, HEPES 
showed the highest activity, which was also higher than 
that of HEPES at pH 8.5. Therefore, HEPES buffer (pH 
9.0) was used for further hydrolysis experiments. High 
product concentrations (mainly MHET and TPA) led to 
a reduction in pH because of insufficient buffer concen -
tration, resulting in a decrease in PET hydrolysis, as the 
optimal pH of Cut190 is on the alkaline side (Kawai et al. 
2014). A product level lower than 50 mM requires at least 
Fig. 1 Molecular weight before and after enzyamatic hydrolysis. Reactions (1 ml) were performed at 70 °C for 3 days using Cut190*SS, one piece of 
6 mm ∅ PET-GF film and 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.5), as described in “Materials and methods” . Degradation rates of reactions 1 and 2 were 33.6 
and 31.4%, respectively. Mn: number-average molecular weight. Mw: weight-average molecular weight
Page 6 of 15Kawai et al. AMB Express          (2022) 12:134 
100  mM HEPES buffer, with higher product concentra -
tions requiring higher buffer concentrations (150 mM for 
70–80 mM product and 200 mM for 80–100 mM prod -
uct) to maintain an alkaline pH for longer incubation. 
The positive correlation between the buffer concentra -
tion and the enzymatic performance of a PET hydrolase 
has also been reported (Pfaff et al. 2022).
As suggested above, PET hydrolysis occurs in layers, 
and it is expected that widening the surface area can 
accelerate the degradation. When the number of 6  mm 
∅ film pieces was increased (Fig.  2), the product concen -
trations increased, indicating that higher surface area 
promoted the enzyme reaction. To further increase the 
surface area, we prepared powder samples using differ -
ent methods (powders 1–3), as described in “Materials 
and methods” . The degradation of the powdered form 
of amorphous PET was two-fold more than the film at 
approximately the same weight, except for powder 3, 
supporting the finding that the larger the surface dimen -
sion, the higher the degradation (Table  2). Compared 
with powder 1 (prepared with pre-freezing), powder 3 
(prepared without pre-freezing) showed approximately 
50% degradation, suggesting that friction heat generated 
during milling of PET pellets without pre-freezing must 
have caused physical aging on the surface of powder 3, as 
suggested by Wei et al. (2019). Therefore, pre-freezing is 
required to prevent undesirable aging of PET powder by 
the generated heat. 
We then hypothesized that enhanced adsorption of 
the enzyme on the PET surface can promote the enzyme 
reaction. Furukawa et  al. (2018, 2019) reported that a 
negatively charged surfactant promoted PET hydroly -
sis by Is PETase, and a positively charged surfactant was 
effective for Tf_Cut2, by increasing the binding of these 
enzymes on the PET surface. We evaluated the effect 
of differently charged surfactants with the same fatty 
acid chain length  (C12) on enzyme adsorption. For com -
parison, we employed the same concentration (30  ppm; 
approximately 90  μM) of surfactants as used by Furu -
kawa et al. (2019). As shown in Additional file  1: Fig. S4, 
the addition of the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethyl -
ammonium chloride promoted the reaction by approxi -
mately 30%, although the nonionic surfactant slightly 
inhibited the enzyme reaction, and the anionic surfactant 
slightly enhanced the reaction. We then tested other tri -
methylammonium chloride surfactants with shorter and 
longer fatty acids  (C10 and  C14), but dodecyltrimethyl -
ammonium chloride was the best additive to increase 
the adsorption of Cut190 to the PET surface (Fig.  3A). 
The surfactant probably meditates the appropriate dis -
tance between the PET surface and the active cleft of the 
Cut190 structure to improve enzyme binding to PET, as 
illustrated in Fig. 3B.
Micronization improves enzymatic recovery of monomer 
products from post‑consumer PET materials
As the expanded surface area promoted PET degrada -
tion, we attempted to micronize amorphous PET pellets 
or films and post-consumer PET products such as pack -
ages and bottles. In contrast to amorphous PET pellets, 
PET films, including flat films, shaped packages, and 
bottles (already stretched during the manufacturing pro -
cess) cannot be sufficiently powdered. These PET films, 
however, were homogenized into small pieces using a 
homogenizer, as described in “Materials and methods”.  
Homogenization of PET products are proposed here for 
the first time for application to PET products with dif -
ferent shapes and crystallinities (different hardness), 
providing a novel means for evaluating the degradability

of PET films. Although homogenization did not signifi -
cantly change the crystallinity and molecular weights of 
PET samples, it changed the amorphous states; the rigid 
amorphous region (RAF) was increased, and the mobile 
amorphous fraction (MAF) consequently decreased 
(Additional file 1: Table S3). The change in the RAF/MAF 
ratio was small in bottle pellets but rather large in amor -
phous films. The friction of metal blade with PET during 
homogenization can generate heat and switch MAF to 
RAF, the effect of which is more severe in the soft amor -
phous films than in the hard bottle flakes. While amor -
phous PET plain films (PET-GF is often used) are known 
to be degraded by various PET hydrolases (Ronqvist et al. 
2009; Kawai et al. 2014; Barth et al. 2016; Oda et al. 2018; 
Sonnendecker et al. 2022), they are not used as-is for any 
practical purpose except in research experiments. The 
amorphous PET package exhibited the degradation level 
like that of the amorphous PET film as the homogenized 
suspension prepared from them. The suspension pre -
pared from PET bottle flakes showed lower degradabil -
ity than that prepared from the amorphous package, but 
considerably higher than that of the original flakes (trace 
level) (Table  3). These results indicate that crystallinity, 
MAF/RAF ratio, and surface area are the major limiting 
factors for enzymatic PET hydrolysis.

The optimum cationic surfactant concentration to 
maximize PET degradability was determined for PET 
film, PET suspension, and PET powder (Fig. 4). Although 
powder 2 (C) has more than twice the surface area of the 
film (A) (Table  2), it required a lower optimal concen -
tration of the surfactant. In addition, although the con -
centration of PET in the homogenized PET bottle pellet 
(B) is approximately one-fourth that of (A) and (C), the 
optimal concentration of the surfactant is approximately 
the same as those for (A) and (C). Therefore, the different 
PET forms might exhibit varying surface affinities of (A)–
(C) for the surfactant with the shape/size or the surface 
microstructure being related to the binding of the sur -
factant on the polymer surface and the enzyme. Notably, 
the homogenized PET bottle pellet (B) showed approxi -
mately 60% degradation with 50  ppm dodecyltrimeth -
ylammonium chloride, the value of which is more than 
the amount of MAF (29%), suggesting significant deg -
radation of RAF (43%) (see Additional file  1: Table  S3). 
Powder 2 (C), with particle sizes of a few μm to 10 μm in 
length, generated over 90 mM of total products with over 
80% of degradation. Taken together, surface dimensions, 
surface properties, and amorphous states of PET, as well 
as the appropriate surfactants to facilitate enzyme bind -
ing on the PET surface, can contribute to PET hydrolysis.
Engineering of Cut190
Among the Cut190 variants reported to date, Cut190*SS 
has been shown to be the best performing enzyme, 
retaining high activity at 70 °C (PET glass transition tem -
perature) (Oda et al. 2018). In another study (Senga et al. 
2020), a variant with the three C-terminal amino acids 
deleted (Cut190**) showed better thermostability than 
Cut190*. Based on the structural analysis (Miyakawa 
et  al. 2014), we first focused on Q138 and found that 
the Q138A mutation in Cut190*SS enhanced its activ -
ity towards PET (Oda et al. 2018). Tournier et al. (2020) 
reported that mutating Y127 in LCC (corresponding 
to Q138 of Cut190) to glycine (smaller than alanine) 
improved the thermostability of the enzyme. Chen et al. 
(2022) compared Q92 mutants of T. fusca cutinase (cor -
responding to Q138 of Cut190), resulting in the higher 
activity of Q92G than Q92A. Cui et  al. (2021) reported 
the efficiency of L136F/Q138Y (expressed as correspond-
ing positions in Cut190) introduced in PETase from Ide-
onella sakaiensis (IsPETase) (DuraPETase). Most recently, 
Pfaff et  al. (2022) constructed L136F/Q138Y mutant of 
PES-H1 as the best performing variant. Although the 
importance of the Q138 position in PET hydrolases has 
no doubt, type I (TfCut2, Cut190 and LCC) and type II 
(IsPETase, PES-H1) hydrolases (Eiamthong et  al. 2022) 
showed different replacement effects. Considering these 
results, we made several Cut190 variants, as listed in 
Table 1 and compared their PET hydrolyzing activities 
(Table  4). In the presence of dodecyltrimethylammo -
nium chloride, increasing the reaction temperature of 
Cut190*SS till 65 °C promoted the reaction, but the reac -
tion rate decreased at 67 °C, although Cut190*SS exhib -
ited high activity at 70 °C (Oda et al. 2018). Cut190**SS 
showed higher activity than Cut190*SS, indicating that 
deletion of the three C-terminal amino acids is effec -
tive, not only for Cut190* but also for Cut1190*SS. Ala -
nine appeared to be better than glycine at position 138 
(in Cut190**SS/L136F and Cut190**SS/L136F/A138G, 
respectively), although the difference in activity was not

Cut190*SS under the standard reaction conditions except that buffer 
concentration in A (50–100 ppm) (160–310 μM) and C (0–100 ppm) 
(0–310 μM) was raised to 150 mM. The reactions were performed in 
duplicate. Variations in values are indicated by open circles for total 
products and open squares for degradation (%)

significant. As the expression level of Cut190**SS/L136F/
Q138G/F255I was tremendously decreased, additional 
mutation (F255I) is disadvantageous for the Cut190.
We used 24% glycerol to keep the enzyme activity for 
longer time, as described in “Materials and methods”.  
Reduction of glycerol concentration or replacement of 
glycerol with ethylene glycol were evaluated, as shown 
in Fig.  5. Compared with the activity at 24% glycerol, 
the activity at 12% glycerol was decreased. Although 
the activity at 24% ethylene glycol was approximately 
two-thirds of that at 24% glycerol, decreased concentra -
tions (6–16%) of ethylene glycol enhanced the activity by 
more than 10%. As ethylene glycol is one of the hydro -
lytic products from PET, replacement of glycerol with 
ethylene glycol should be better for the application of the 
Cut190 to bio-recycling of PET.
Hydrolysis of PEF
The components of PEF are ethylene glycol and 2,5-furan 
dicarboxylic acid, of which the latter can be produced

The reaction mixture contained HEPES–NaOH buffer (pH 9.0), 2.5 mM  CaCl2, 24% glycerol, 50 ppm dodecyltrimethylamine chloride and approximately 2 μM Cut190* 
or its derivative. The concentrations of the buffer were 100 mM for Cut190* and Cut190**, and 150 mM for others. Preincubation was performed at room temperature 
for 10–20 min with PET powder 2 (20 mg/ml) in the reaction mixture except enzyme and  CaCl2. Then each enzyme and  CaCl2 were added, and the incubation was

from carbohydrates (Munoz de Diego et  al. 2011). The 
production of 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid is far less 
expensive than that of terephthalate. Therefore, PEF is 
expected to be a substitute for PET (Pellis et  al. 2016), 
although it might be difficult to replace all PET prod -
ucts with PEF. Cut190 has a broad substrate specificity 
towards various polyesters (aliphatic, aliphatic-co-aro -
matic, and PET) (Kawai et  al. 2014). We therefore syn -
thesized PEF (Additional file 1: Scheme S1) and tested its 
degradability using Cut190*SS. The results indicated that 
Cut190-type enzymes can recognize PEF as a substrate 
(Table 5), suggesting the potential application of Cut190 
variants for future bio-recycling of various polyester 
materials. In contrast to the PET results, dodecyltrimeth-
ylammonium chloride inhibited the hydrolysis of PEF. 
PEF1 with higher weight-average molecular weight (Mw) 
and number-average molecular weight (Mn) was hydro -
lyzed more than PEF 2 with lower Mw and Mn, which 
agrees with the report of Pellis et al. (2016).
All data generated or analyzed during this study are 
included in this published article and its additional infor -
mation files.
Discussion
Although the amorphous PET film was degraded by over 
30%, almost no shift in molecular weights was observed 
for the remaining film, as shown in Fig.  1. The attack 
of the enzyme on a PET molecule proceeds via endo-
type hydrolysis (Eberl et  al. 2009). Herrero Acero et  al. 
(2011) and Thumarat et  al. (2015) suggested an endo-
type scission mechanism using a PET model compound, 
bis(benzoyloxyethyl)terephthalate. In addition, BHET, 
MHET, and TPA have been identified as degradation 
products of PET (Herrero Acero et al. 2011; Barth et al. 
2016; Wei et  al. 2016; Oda et  al. 2018), which suggests 
exo-type hydrolysis from the ends of the polymer chain. 
Taken together, endo-type and exo-type hydrolyses must 
proceed concurrently during PET hydrolysis. Each poly -
mer molecule is fragmented on the surface of the poly -
mer block and removed one by one, leaving the block 
of non-depolymerized molecules. Even if fragmented 
molecules remain on the surface of the PET block, they 
are readily released from the surface, or their content is 
negligible and does not affect the entire molecular size. 
This is quite different from the degradation pattern of 
polyvinyl alcohol only by endo-type degradation, where 
the polymer is water-soluble, and the molecular size of 
the polymer decreases rapidly because the polymer mol -
ecules are solved, dispersed, and uniformly susceptible to 
enzyme attack (Kawai and Hu 2009). As PET is solid, only 
the surface molecules are susceptible to enzyme attack, 
but most of the molecules are not exposed to enzyme 
attack unless the upper surface is removed after fragmen-
tation. Once an ester bond is hydrolyzed on the surface 
by the enzyme, MHET/BHET could be produced by exo-
type hydrolysis from the ends of fragmented molecules 
(more attackable by the enzyme), as illustrated (Fig.  6). 
Sufficiently depolymerized molecules are released from a 
PET block or removed by washing before GPC analysis, 
resulting in no change in the entire molecular size of the 
remaining block (Fig. 1). Therefore, the hydrolysis pattern 
of PET is a mixed type of endo-type and exo-type hydro -
lyses by a single PET hydrolase. Thomsen et  al. (2022) 
suggested that the initial random, endo-scission action of 
enzymes immediately does not release detectable soluble 
products, but once a sufficient number of cleavage points 
has been achieved, the continued enzymatic action 
results in release of detectable hydrolysis products, using 
LCC variant and DuraPETase. Wei et al. (2019) also pro -
posed the same degradation mechanism, using TfCut2. 
Therefore, the concerted reaction mechanism by endo-
scission and exo-scission is considered to be common to 
PET hydrolases. Notably, thermostable PET hydrolases, 
especially from actinomycetes, can hydrolyze BHET 
and MHET in addition to PET, in contrast to Is PETase, 
which does not hydrolyze MHET to TPA and requires 
an MHET-hydrolyzing enzyme to be added for complete 
PET degradation (Yoshida et al. 2016; Palm et al. 2019).
The increase in the surface area of PET resulted in 
its increased degradation, either as film or particle. 
Therefore, micronization is assumed to be an effective 
strategy for PET bio-recycling (Gamerith et  al. 2017; 
Tournier et  al. 2020). However, careless micronization 
caused undesirable aging by heat generated during the 
process, increasing RAF as found with powder 3 (Addi -
tional file  1: Table  S1). Wei et  al. (2019) reported that 
RAF is recalcitrant for biocatalytic degradation, in con -
trast to that MAF is readily degraded. Gamerith et  al.

(2017) reported that semi-crystalline PET powder (24% 
crystallinity) from bottle pellets was hydrolyzed higher 
than amorphous PET powder (12% crystallinity) from 
a Goodfellows film, probably due to that both materials 
were crushed without pre-freezing and amorphous film 
must have decreased MAF, compared to bottle pellets, as 
shown in this study (Additional file  1: Table S3). As elu -
cidated by Thomsen et  al. (2022), crystallinity and glass 
transition temperature surely influence the enzymatic 
degradation of PET. On the other hand, Brizendine et al. 
(2022) concluded that amorphization of PET is neces -
sary pretreatment step for the reaction by the LCC vari -
ant, but particle size reduction may not be required. As 
cryomilling of amorphous PET film apparently increased 
crystallinity, thereby decreasing MAF (data not shown 
by Brizendine et  al (2022)), the effect of surface expan -
sion by micronization might have been canceled by the 
decreased MAF and the increased RAF. Post-consumer 
PET bottles were shredded and degraded by 96.2% 
(approximately 40  mM) in 96  h using the best perfor -
mance mutant from T. cellulosilytica cutinase 1 (G63A/
F210I/D205C/E254C/Q93G corresponding to A109/
F255/D250/E296/Q138 in Cut190). They shredded PET 
pieces (cut to 1  cm × 1  cm) using a high-speed rotary 
mill equipped with a 1.0 mm trapezoital hole sieve ring, 
which must have avoided repeated crush of particles with 
blades of the mill and suppressed the aging at minimum. 
Processing of PET waste into readily degradable forms, 
especially without sorting PET materials by shapes and 
crystallinity, must be considered to facilitate the practical 
use of PET bio-recycling. Here we would like to empha -
size the importance of the micronization process of PET 
products to prevent aging, leading to the increase of RAF, 
contrary to the decrease of MAF.
We have suggested the absence of the PET binding 
domain in the Cut190 structure (Numoto et  al. 2018), 
which is common to all cutinases. Furukawa et al. (2018, 
2019) reported that a negatively charged surfactant pro -
moted PET hydrolysis by Is PETase, and a positively 
charged surfactant was effective for Tf_Cut2, by increas -
ing the binding of these enzymes on the PET surface. 
Rhamnolipids enhanced the hydrolysis rate, presumably 
by acting as mediators between Is PETase and PET (Ger -
cke et al. 2021). Here, we confirmed that a cationic sur -
factant promoted PET hydrolysis, which can be explained 
by the presence of mass domains of negative amino acids 
on the Cut190 surface (Fig.  3B). The preference for alkyl 
chain length is most probably related to the appropriate 
distance mediated by a surfactant for the enzyme to bind 
on the PET surface, as illustrated in Fig.  3B. Bååth et al. 
(2022) reported that stronger surface binding of LCC 
and BTA hydrolase 1 of T. fusca is not optimal for the 
enzyme performance on PET and both enzymes showed 
the maximal turnover at intermediate binding strength 
Fig. 6 Concerted depolymerization process by endo-type and exo-type hydrolyses

with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, which was in 
accordance with the Sabatier principle. Therefore, the 
optimal concentration of a surfactant must be carefully 
determined with concentrations of PET and enzymes. In 
conclusion, using an appropriate surfactant as a spacer 
between a solid polymer and an enzyme is simpler, less 
expensive, and more convenient than the fusion of outer 
substrate-binding domains to enable enzyme binding. In 
the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, 
the reaction rate of Cut190*SS increased till 65  °C but 
decreased considerably at 67 °C, although Cut190*SS dis -
plays high activity at 70 °C (Oda et al. 2018). The activity 
of Cut190* against PET-S decreased at 65 °C, compared 
to that at 60  °C, which suggested the influence of addi -
tives included in PET-S (Oda et al. 2018). Similarly, dode-
cyltrimethylammonium chloride must have affected the 
physical property of PET (thermal aging), lowering the 
optimum temperature for the reaction. However, a lower 
reaction temperature is advantageous for saving energy. 
Contrary to the effect of dodecyltrimethylammonium 
chloride on PET hydrolysis, the surfactant showed the 
negative effect on PEF hydrolysis. This must be due to 
the difference in surface properties of PET and PEF (due 
to terephthalate and furanoate included in PET and PEF, 
respectively). Whether charge or the carbon chain length 
of surfactants is related to the degradation of PEF or not 
is remained to be further studied.
The mutation trials for the preparation of Cut190* 
have already been repeated, as shown in Table  1. As 
Cut190** showed better performance than Cut190*, 
Cut190**SS showed better performance than Cut190*SS. 
In this study, Cut190**SS/L136F possessing A138 or 
Cut190**SS/L136F/A138G showed the best PET con -
version of approximately 90% with up to 90  mM prod -
ucts, although A138 seems to be better than G138 in the 
Cut190 structure. The position 138 (according to Cut190 
sequence) is generally occurred by glutamine in homolo -
gous PET hydrolases, except LCC, which has tyrosine 
at this position. We noticed the importance of Q138, 
based on the structural analysis of Cut190 (Miyakawa 
et al. 2014) and first introduced a mutation at this posi -
tion, replacing a large amino acid (glutamine) with a 
small amino acid (alanine), which resulted in better per -
formance (Oda et  al. 2018). Cut190**SS/L136F/A138G 
generated a slightly lower total product concentration 
than Cut190**SS/L136F (Cut190**SS possesses Q138A), 
as shown in Table  4. Tournier et  al. (2020) replaced the 
tyrosine of LCC with glycine, not alanine, and no com -
parison of glycine and alanine was made. Q92 of T. 
fusca cutinase was replaced with serine, alanine and 
glycine, the best performance being Q92G (Chen et  al. 
2022). The Q138 of Cut190 is positioned in the direc -
tion of a polymer chain extension from the active site 
cleft (Kawabata et al. 2017), and the replacement of Q138 
with a small amino acid, such as alanine or glycine, may 
improve the extension of the polymer chain. Further 
mutation to Cut190**SS/L136F/A138G/F255I as per -
formed by Tournier et  al. (2020) significantly reduced 
the expression, as previously found in Cut190*F255A 
(Oda et  al. 2018). Therefore, phenylalanine at position 
255 is most probably required for the stabilization of the 
Cut190 protein, which is completely different from the 
results of LCC and T. fusca cutinase, in which phenyla -
lanine was mutated to isoleucine, displaying the elevated 
PET hydrolysis (Tournier et  al. 2020; Chen et  al. 2022). 
In addition, Cut190 has F106 (oxyanion hole-forming 
amino acid) and the replacement of F with Y (common 
to other hydrolases like TfCut2, LCC and Is PETase) 
showed less activity (Kawabata et  al. 2017). Although 
Cut190 is homologous, especially to type II PET hydro -
lases, Cut190 is considered a unique PET hydrolase. The 
mutation of Cut190* to Cut190**SS/L136F increased 
the product levels (approximately 60  mM to more than 
90 mM), suggesting that Cut190 shows no product inhi -
bition. The LCC variant also accumulated an extremely 
high concentration of hydrolytic products in the absence 
of any additional enzymes able to remove MHET/BHET 
(Tournier et al. 2020). In the cutinase TfCut2 (Wei et al. 
2016), G62A mutation was shown to release the product 
inhibition in PET hydrolysis. LCC and Cut190 already 
have alanine at this position, thereby showing no product 
inhibition. BHET behaved as an inhibitor for PET hydrol-
ysis by Cut1 from T. cellulosilytica (Gamerith et al. 2017). 
As only a trace amount of BHET was detected during 
the reaction time (Herrero Acero et al., 2011; Barth et al. 
2016; Oda et al. 2018) probably due to the fast hydrolysis 
of BHET (Hantani et al. 2018), significant product inhibi-
tion may not be observed with Cut190 and LCC.
Taken together, minor differences in the amino acid 
sequences of each cutinase are important and indis -
pensable for each protein, although the overall struc -
tural similarity is common to Cut190, TfCut, and LCC 
(Kawai 2021; Kawai et  al. 2019, 2020). In this study, 
Cut190**SS variants produced over 90  mM products 
(MHET and TPA) with a conversion rate of approx -
imately 90% at 63 or 65  °C in 3  days (Table  4). Addi -
tionally, Cut190**SS produced approximately 80  mM 
products at 65  °C in 1  day when glycerol 24% was 
replaced with ethylene glycol 10% (Fig.  5). Tournier 
et al. (2020) amorphized and powdered post-consumer 
PET products on a practical scale and reached the best 
value of PET hydrolysis with a minimum of 90% con -
version rate from 20% weight concentration of PET 
suspension at 72 °C in less than 1 day, using LCC vari -
ants. In our case, we used amorphous PET samples 
and powdered/homogenized post-consumer products 
Page 13 of 15
Kawai et al. AMB Express          (2022) 12:134 
 
on a laboratory scale. Therefore, further studies are 
needed, especially at a large/practical scale, to evaluate 
the potential application of engineered Cut190 for PET 
degradation. Here we used HEPES buffer, but it should 
be replaced with another less expensive buffer for bio-
recycling as HEPES buffer is expensive for practical use 
in bio-recycling. Polyols are known to stabilize pro -
teins (Vagenende et al. 2009; Naidu et al. 2020). Cut190 
needs 24% glycerol to keep its activity at elevated tem -
perature (Oda et al. 2018). Ethylene glycol showed bet -
ter performance at lower concentration (6–16%) than 
24% glycerol. As ethylene glycol is one of reaction prod -
ucts from PET or its depolymerized materials such as 
BHET and MHET, it might be advantageous for bio-
recycling. In addition, ethylene glycol is not tenacious 
and easy to use, but glycerol is tenacious and a little 
troublesome to use. Thus, we still need improvements 
of Cut190 variants and their reaction conditions. Nev -
ertheless, we can conclude that Cut190 variants would 
be feasible for practical application in PET recycling.
