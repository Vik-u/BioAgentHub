Abstract: Plastics are highly durable and widely used materials. Current methodologies of plastic
degradation, elimination, and recycling are ﬂawed. In recent years, biodegradation (the usage of
microorganisms for material recycling) has grown as a valid alternative to previously used methods.
The evolution of bioengineering techniques and the discovery of novel microorganisms and enzymes
with degradation ability have been key. One of the most produced plastics is PET, a long chain
polymer of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) repeating monomers. Many enzymes
with PET degradation activity have been discovered, characterized, and engineered in the last few
years. However, classiﬁcation and integrated knowledge of these enzymes are not trivial. Therefore,
in this work we present a summary of currently known PET degrading enzymes, focusing on their
structural and activity characteristics, and summarizing engineering efforts to improve activity.
Although several high potential enzymes have been discovered, further efforts to improve activity
and thermal stability are necessary.

1. Introduction
Synthetic plastic materials are long-chain polymers with high durability and resis-
tance, typically derived from fossil-fuel by-products [1]. Massive plastic production and
usage began in 1950 [2,3], when 2 million tons were produced annually [4]. Production has
tripled in the last 20 years [5]. According to a recent Plastics Europe [6] report, 359 million
tons of plastic were produced worldwide in 2018. In 2019, this number grew to 368 million
tons [6], and is expected to surpass 34 billion tons by 2050 [2], cumulative, of which 12 bil-
lion are expected to be deposited in landﬁlls or contaminated natural environments [ 7].
The industries of packaging and construction amount to over 60% of plastic demand [6].
Most plastics produced are single-use, poorly discarded products, resulting in accumula-
tion in various ecosystems [8] with serious consequences for soil, marine, and terrestrial
species [9–12].
The most common strategy for plastic elimination is landﬁll deposition [3,13]. This is
a hazardous strategy with countless disadvantages [14]. Degradation of plastic waste is
slow, and its accumulation leads to environmental contamination of groundwater, marine,
and terrestrial environments. Incineration is another harmful and widely used strategy, as it
leads to the spreading of toxic and volatile wastes, which are dangerous to the environment
and human beings [14,15].
Industrial plastic recycling is the conversion of plastic waste into reusable materials,
typically by mechanical or chemical processing. However, currently employed tactics
are not sufﬁcient to satisfy the recycling needs of the ever-growing plastic industry [ 3].

Mechanical recycling does not change the chemical structure of the polymer, and impli-
cates previously collecting, sorting, shredding, grinding, melting, and washing of the
material [16–18]. These methods have several disadvantages—they are not applicable
to temperature-sensitive or multilayer plastics [19], often result in material deterioration,
and sorting brings in economical and applicability issues [20]. Furthermore, mechanical
recycling is hazardous for the environment and constitutes a public health danger, since
it is a common source of toxic organic compounds [ 21]. Chemical recycling typically
leads to the polymer’s degradation into its monomeric building blocks [18], via hydrolysis,
methanolysis, and glycolysis strategies. However, it normally involves a high cost and
high energy process, consuming active catalysts [22]. In addition, chemical methods are
environmentally harmful, as they constitute a source of volatile organic compounds [23,24].
Biodegradation, the cleavage of plastic polymers into monomers by microorganism pro-
duced enzymes [25], is an environmentally friendly strategy [ 26] that has been gaining
more attention. These microorganisms can use degradation products as a carbon or energy
source through excretion of extracellular enzymes and metabolites [27–29]. These enzymes
typically degrade the polymers with the assistance of water molecules and are known
as hydrolases [30,31]. The by-products of enzymatic processing can be used for different
applications, besides being naturally up taken by cells [13,24]. Spontaneous biodegradation
is often preceded by oxidizing agents or UV-light [32]. Recent advances have placed plastic
biodegradation at the top of promising recycling strategies, even if several limitations still
remain to be solved [33].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most used and synthesized plastics [9].
PET, derived from crude-oil [34], is composed of repeating units of terephthalic acid (TPA)
and ethylene glycol (EG) monomers [35], and exists as an amorphous as well as a semi-
crystalline synthetic polymer [36]. It is typically produced by condensation of TPA and EG
or bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (BHET) and EG [37]. The main components and
degradation products of PET are represented in Figure 1. The physiochemical properties
of PET result in diverse applications in the textile, packaging and bottle producing indus-
tries [9]. PET bottle production in 2016 was of 485 billion unities [6]. In 2021, the estimate
of production increased to 583 billion bottles [35]. PET ﬁbers are extremely attractive for
their high durability, elasticity, strength, and resistance to chemicals [38]. Unfortunately,
the same characteristics that make PET an attractive material also result in difﬁcult degra-
dation and consequent accumulation in the environment [39]. Several strategies have been
described for PET mechanical [21,40] and chemical [23,24,41,42] recycling, but the high cost
and environmental impact of these methods lead to an urgent need for the development of
more effective and greener alternatives.
PET is a high molecular weight polyester [43,44], which presents a stable backbone and
crystallinity, which inhibits natural breakdown [34,45]. As a semi-crystalline polymer with
a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 76 ◦C [37], PET presents amorphous and crystalline
regions [46]. The T g is the temperature at which a reversible transition between a more
tightly packed crystalline state and a more rubber-like amorphous state happens [ 47].
When PET is mostly in an amorphous stage, the polymeric chain is more readily available
for enzymatic mediated biodegradation [48]. This is due to the increased mobility of PET
chains in an amorphous stage in comparison with the crystalline state [49].
PET is by far the most studied polymer in terms of biodegradation, and the one
with the largest number of degrading enzymes identiﬁed and characterized [50]. The ﬁrst
enzyme with PETase-like activity, secreted byThermobiﬁda fusca, was described by Müller
et al. [51] in 2005. Since then, several lipases, cutinases, and esterases have been character-
ized [52–58]. In 2016, Yoshida et al. [52] identiﬁed a bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis
that secretes a consortium of PET degrading enzymes— IsPETase and IsMHETase. The dis-
covery of speciﬁc PET hydrolases reinforced the interest for microbial PET degradation
and inspired the identiﬁcation, characterization, and enhancement of multiple enzymes.

PET is a high molecular weight polyester [43,44], which presents a stable backbone 
and crystallinity, which inhibits natural breakdown [34,45]. As a semi‐crystalline polymer 
with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 76 °C [37], PET presents amorphous and crys‐
talline regions [46]. The Tg is the temperature at which a reversible transition between a 
more tightly packed crystalline state and a more rubber‐like amorphous state happens 
[47]. When PET is mostly in an amorphous stage, the polymeric chain is more readily 
available for enzymatic mediated biodegradation [48]. This is due to the increased mobil‐
ity of PET chains in an amorphous stage in comparison with the crystalline state [49]. 
PET is by far the most studied polymer in terms of biodegradation, and the one with 
the largest number of degrading enzymes identified and characterized [50]. The first en‐
zyme with PETase‐like activity, secreted by Thermobifida fusca, was described by Müller et 
al. [51] in 2005. Since then, several lipases, cutinases, and esterases have been character‐
ized [52–58]. In 2016, Yoshida et al. [52] identified a bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis 
that secretes a consortium of PET degrading enzymes— IsPETase and IsMHETase. The 
discovery of specific PET hydrolases reinforced the interest for microbial PET degradation 
and inspired the identification, characterization, and enhancement of multiple enzymes. 
The growing usage of enzymes in biodegradation is partially made possible by the 
evolution of diverse, but complementary, scientific fields. Even though enzymes are nat‐
ural catalysts, their efficiency, stability, and catalytic turnover is often insufficient to be 
feasibly applicable [59]. Thus, diverse enzyme engineering approaches to improve cata‐
lytic, stability and productivity properties have been developed. Ultimately, the goal of 
enzymatic genetic engineering is to modify the amino acid sequences through gene alter‐
ation [60]. 
Some of the most employed genetic engineering methods are directed evolution, 
DNA shuffling, saturation mutagenesis, fusion, site‐directed mutagenesis, and truncation 
[61]. In directed evolution, no data on the protein structure and function are required, and

The growing usage of enzymes in biodegradation is partially made possible by the
evolution of diverse, but complementary, scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Even though enzymes are
natural catalysts, their efﬁciency, stability, and catalytic turnover is often insufﬁcient to
be feasibly applicable [ 59]. Thus, diverse enzyme engineering approaches to improve
catalytic, stability and productivity properties have been developed. Ultimately, the goal
of enzymatic genetic engineering is to modify the amino acid sequences through gene
alteration [60].
Some of the most employed genetic engineering methods are directed evolution,
DNA shufﬂing, saturation mutagenesis, fusion, site-directed mutagenesis, and trunca-
tion [61]. In directed evolution, no data on the protein structure and function are required,
and it works by building a library of randomly generated mutants. On the other hand,
in rational enzymatic design or semi-rational design, information on protein structure and
function is required [60,61].
Enzymatic engineering through rational design, which implies introducing speciﬁc
and pre-deﬁned changes in the amino acid sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, has been
growing as an emerging family of engineering techniques [60,62].
Since rational design implies knowledge of protein function and structure, it fre-
quently begins with computer aided design [ 60]. The rapid increase of high-resolution
protein structures available on the PDB database [63], and the improvement of structure-
prediction tools, such as the recently released AlphaFold [64], allows for molecular and
atomistic perspectives on the structure and function of enzymes. This pipeline combines
computational [65] and experimental [66] techniques to improve enzymatic thermal stabil-
ity (through, for example, introduction of additional disulﬁde bonds), ﬁlling protein voids,
increase enzymatic turnover and efﬁciency, or attribute new functions to the enzyme.
At this stage, several PET degrading enzymes have been discovered, and as a lot of
work has been done on structural solving and characterization, the emerging trend for the
future of the ﬁeld is the engineering and improvement of these found enzymes. Structure
resolution and atomistic understanding of an enzyme is tightly related with the ability to
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 4 of 63
perform rational design, and several of the efforts employed on PET enzymes follow this
line of thought, as mutagenesis is used both to conﬁrm amino acid roles, and to improve
enzymatic characteristics.
This review presents an overview of the current paradigm of PET enzymatic biodegra-
dation in academic research, with a particular structural, mutagenic, and mechanistic
perspective. Special attention is dedicated to the most promising PET degrading enzymes.
In addition, we provide insight into several promising enzymes with PET degrading poten-
tial, which have been the subject of preliminary characterization in recent years, but that
still require further biochemical and structural studies to conﬁrm their full potential and
explore/modulate their activity. Some microorganisms with the ability to utilize PET as an
energy source are also highlighted. Finally, several enzymes with polyesterase activity but
no speciﬁc PET activity are also discussed.
2. Enzymes Involved in PET Degradation
To date, more than 24 different enzymes with PET degrading ability have been identi-
ﬁed. All of these enzymes are hydrolases, catalyzing the breaking of the PET polymer into
TPA, EG, BHET, and (mono-(2-hydroxyehyl)terephthalic acid (MHET).
Hydrolases are enzymes that catalyze the breaking of chemical bonds through a
reaction with water. They constitute a particularly versatile and ample class of enzymes,
with an ability to act on diverse substrates of different sizes and complexity, such as
proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Hydrolases can be characterized by
an enzyme commission number EC3 and can be classiﬁed into 13 different subclasses,
according to the speciﬁc types of bonds that they cleave [31]. In fact, this class of enzymes
can act on extremely different bonds, with very different strengths [ 67]. The rates of
uncatalyzed hydrolysis reactions of known substrates for hydrolases at 25 ◦C have been
shown to span over 17 orders of magnitude, with activation free energies in solution
differing from 21 to 44 kcal/mol [68]. Hence, the challenge posed by nature to the different
hydrolases can be quite diverse [31], and the intrinsic stability of PET, makes its enzyme-
assisted hydrolysis certainly a tough challenge. However, despite the challenge, different
hydrolases present in different organisms have been shown to exhibit at least some PET
degrading ability. For that, these enzymes employ a variety of strategies, some still not fully
uncovered. Hydrolases involved in PET degradation act on ester bonds and are part of class
3.1 [69]. Furthermore, most PET degrading enzymes belong to the 3.40.50.1820 superfamily,
according to the CATH database [ 70], since they share a conserved catalytic domain
and assume the typical alpha/beta hydrolase fold. Breaking of PET bonds is typically
accomplished by a catalytic triad involving a serine, a histidine and a negatively charged
residue, usually an aspartate or a glutamate [ 71]. During the reaction, the product is
commonly stabilized by an oxyanion hole made up of two or three residues [72].
The fact that PET exhibits a glass temperature (Tg) of 76◦C, which is important to make
the polymeric chain more accessible for enzymatic mediated biodegradation, constitutes
an additional challenge for PET degrading enzymes, as such, enzymes must also be able to
function at such high temperatures. Enzymatic melting temperature (Tm) is the point when
there is an equilibrium between protein folding and unfolding and is strongly associated
with stability and catalytic ability [ 73]. As evidenced by Figure 2, most PET degrading
enzymes exhibit T m lower than the T g of PET, even after engineering efforts. While
enzymatic thermal stability is a complex problem, PET degrading enzymes use disulﬁde
bonds as a stability strategy. Joo et al. [ 74] proposed a classiﬁcation system for PET
degrading enzymes that divides them in two major groups: enzymes with one disulﬁde
bond belong to Type I, and enzymes with an additional bridge are Type II molecules.
The second group is further divided into Type IIa and IIb depending on the speciﬁc amino
acid composition of the enzymatic binding site. We followed this classiﬁcation system
when enough information on the enzyme and organism of origin was available.

and assume the typical alpha/beta hydrolase fold. Breaking of PET bonds is typically ac‐
complished by a catalytic triad involving a serine, a histidine and a negatively charged 
residue, usually an aspartate or a glutamate [71]. During the reaction, the product is com‐
monly stabilized by an oxyanion hole made up of two or three residues [72]. 
The fact that PET exhibits a glass temperature (Tg) of 76 °C, which is important to 
make the polymeric chain more accessible for enzymatic mediated biodegradation, con‐
stitutes an additional challenge for PET degrading enzymes, as such, enzymes must also 
be able to function at such high temperatures. Enzymatic melting temperature (Tm) is the 
point when there is an equilibrium between protein folding and unfolding and is strongly 
associated with stability and catalytic ability [73]. As evidenced by Figure 2, most PET 
degrading enzymes exhibit Tm lower than the Tg of PET, even after engineering efforts. 
While enzymatic thermal stability is a complex problem, PET degrading enzymes use di‐
sulfide bonds as a stability strategy. Joo et al. [74] proposed a classification system for PET 
degrading enzymes that divides them in two major groups: enzymes with one disulfide 
bond belong to Type I, and enzymes with an additional bridge are Type II molecules. The 
second group is further divided into Type IIa and IIb depending on the specific amino 
acid composition of the enzymatic binding site. We followed this classification system 
when enough information on the enzyme and organism of origin was available.

2.1.1. Discovery 
IsPETase is a PET hydrolyzing enzyme first identified by Yoshida et al. [52] in 2016. 
This enzyme is responsible for degrading PET to MHET as a major product and EG, TPA, 
and BHET as secondary products [52,75]. The IsPETase producing bacterium, Ideonella sa‐
kaiensis 201–F6, is capable of assimilating PET as a major energy and carbon source. It was 
identified from a novel microbial consortium formed on PET film, isolated, and charac‐
terized as depending nutritionally on PET. Once it was confirmed that I. sakaiensis hydro‐
lyzed PET to MHET, TPA, and BHET, two enzymes were identified as responsible, 
IsPETase and IsMHETase. IsPETase was determined to have higher activity against PET 
film and BHET than the previously identified enzymes TfHCut, LCC and FsCut by 120,

2.1. Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase)
2.1.1. Discovery
IsPETase is a PET hydrolyzing enzyme ﬁrst identiﬁed by Yoshida et al. [52] in 2016.
This enzyme is responsible for degrading PET to MHET as a major product and EG, TPA,
and BHET as secondary products [ 52,75]. The IsPETase producing bacterium, Ideonella
sakaiensis 201–F6, is capable of assimilating PET as a major energy and carbon source. It was
identiﬁed from a novel microbial consortium formed on PET ﬁlm, isolated, and character-
ized as depending nutritionally on PET. Once it was conﬁrmed that I. sakaiensis hydrolyzed
PET to MHET, TPA, and BHET, two enzymes were identiﬁed as responsible,IsPETase and
IsMHETase. IsPETase was determined to have higher activity against PET ﬁlm and BHET
than the previously identiﬁed enzymes Tf HCut, LCC and FsCut by 120, 5.5 and 88 times

(respectively) at 30 ◦C and pH 7. However, activity was lower against aliphatic esters when
compared with the mentioned enzymes, indicating IsPETase preference for PET [52].
2.1.2. Structure
IsPETase is composed of 290 amino acid residues, exists as a functional monomer [74],
and its three-dimensional structure has been explored by several structural, experimental,
and computational studies [ 74–76]. The enzyme presents a canonical α/β-hydrolase
fold with nine mixed β-strands that make up a central β-sheet, surrounded by seven α
helixes [74]. At the active site, a conserved catalytic triad composed of a Serine (Ser160),
Histidine (His237) and Aspartate (Asp206) residues is found in a broad active site cleft.
Ser160 is inserted in a nucleophilic elbow with a sharp turn conformation [ 75] at the
beginning of α4 [77]. The catalytic Asp206 residue is in the loop region between β7 and α5,
while His237 is found in the loop region between β8 and α6 [77].
IsPETase presents a highly polarized surface charge, creating a dipole across the
macromolecule and resulting in an isoelectric point of 9.6 [ 75]. Several PET degrading
enzymes present charged surfaces, as evidenced by Figure 5.

5.5 and 88 times (respectively) at 30 °C and pH 7. However, activity was lower against

erence for PET [52].

IsPETase is composed of 290 amino acid residues, exists as a functional monomer 
[74], and its three‐dimensional structure has been explored by several structural, experi‐
mental, and computational studies [74–76]. The enzyme presents a canonical α/β‐hydro‐
lase fold with nine mixed β‐strands that make up a central β‐sheet, surrounded by seven

Histidine (His237) and Aspartate (Asp206) residues is found in a broad active site cleft. 
Ser160 is inserted in a nucleophilic elbow with a sharp turn conformation [75] at the be‐
ginning of α4 [77]. The catalytic Asp206 residue is in the loop region between β7 and α5, 
while His237 is found in the loop region between β8 and α6 [77]. 
IsPETase presents a highly polarized surface charge, creating a dipole across the mac‐
romolecule and resulting in an isoelectric point of 9.6 [75]. Several PET degrading en‐

DS1 is speciﬁc to IsPETase. Located near the active center, it has an essential role in catalytic
activity and active site integrity. In other known PET hydrolases, this bond corresponds to
highly conserved alanine residues [76]. In IsPETase, the bridge connects β-strand 7 to a
loop connecting β-strand 8 and helix α5. This loop, anchored to the DS1 bond, contains the
histidine catalytic residue. For its speciﬁcity and location, DS1 is thought to be one of the
structural motifs responsible for the increased IsPETase activity when compared to other
PET degrading enzymes [76,78].
A conserved Tryptophan residue (Trp185) assumes several conformations, termed
A, B, and C, and is often referred to as the wobbly tryptophan, as represented in Figure 6.
Even though the presence of this amino acid residue has been observed before in simi-
lar enzymes, its different conformations only appear in IsPETase, since in other known
structures it always assumes the C conformation [76]. The ﬂexibility of Trp185 was further
conﬁrmed by induced ﬁt Docking and molecular dynamics studies [ 75]. In its vicinity is a
serine (Ser214) residue (histidine in homologous enzymes), which allows for the A and B
Trp185 conformers to be accommodated in the catalytic site [76].

The ﬁrst IsPETase structures were determined by Han et al. [76] in 2017. The ﬁrst apo-
structure of IsPETase was solved at 1.58 Å (PDB: 5XG0) and revealed the main structural
ﬁndings already described. Despite several efforts, the authors were unable to obtain
co-crystallized structures between wild type (WT) IsPETase and different ligands. For that
reason, an inactive S160A (catalytic serine) and R159G double mutant was produced,
and complexed structures were obtained with substrate (PDB: 5XH3) and product (PDB:
5XH2) analogues. Mutated apo-form enzyme structures were also resolved and used as a
control to verify that the overall enzymatic fold and structure were unaffected by the point
mutations necessary for obtaining the complexes.
Joo et al. [74] have solved and published several IsPETase structures since 2017 [81,83].
The group’s apo-form enzyme was solved at 1.54 Å (PDB: 5XJH) and was used to per-
form molecular docking studies with 2-HE(MHET)4, a 4-MHET molecule mimicking a
4-moieties PET chain [ 74]. The binding mode of the ﬁrst moiety at the active site con-
ﬁrmed the presence of the conserved catalytic triad (Ser160, His237, and Asp206) and of an
oxyanion hole (Tyr87 and Met161) at appropriate distances for stabilization of the reaction
intermediates. The docking of a longer molecule led to the conclusion that the binding site
is a mostly hydrophobic, with a long and shallow L-shaped cleft on a ﬂat surface. Further-
more, the binding site is divided into two subsites—subsite I (deﬁned by residues Tyr87,
Gln19, Met161, and Trp185) and II (residues Thr88, Ala89, Trp159, Ser238, and Asn241),
being that subsite II is further partitioned into subsite IIa, IIb, and IIc. One PET moiety
binds the catalytic center in subsite I, while subsite II accommodates the remaining three
moieties through mostly hydrophobic interactions. The location of the subsites in relation
to the catalytic triad and the substrate are represented in Figure 7. The role of Trp185 in
subsite I was evidenced by the π–πinteractions between this residue and the benzene ring
in PET. This stabilization of the ﬁrst PET moiety is aided by Met161 and Ile208 [74].

2.1.3. Activity 
Several mutagenesis and activity studies confirmed the catalytic and active role of 
many of the amino acid residues on the structural aspects proposed. IsPETase engineering 
assays published to date are summarized in Table S1. 
Given the Tg of PET, the polymer is more readily available for enzymatic degradation 
at higher temperatures [84]. However, the melting temperature (Tm) of IsPETase was de‐
termined at 48.81 °C [81]. For that reason, engineering of PETase to increase enzymatic 
activity should be paired with engineering efforts to raise thermal stability and durability 
[77]. 
Mutagenesis of the catalytic triad to alanine residues (S160A, H237A, and D206A) 
consistently resulted in total loss of enzymatic activity, confirming their critical essential 
role as the catalytic triad [74,78]. Disulfide bridge DS1 disrupting mutations (C203S and 
C239S) resulted in very low enzymatic activity and lowered Tm by over 10 °C, confirming 
the essential role of the IsPETase specific bridge in both activity and stability [74,76]. Most 
studies targeting the oxyanion hole and substrate interacting residue Tyr87 with various 
substrates (PET film, PET bottle and BHET monomers) reported diminished activity and 
lower amounts of product released [74,76,83], although in one study, a slight activity in‐
crease is reported [78]. Engineering of the other oxyanion hole amino acid residue Met161 
consistently resulted in lower PETase activity against all tested substrates [74,76,78,83]. 
The wobbling Trp185 has also been the target of engineering studies—replacement  of this 
residue with an alanine results in highly diminished to total loss of activity [74–76,78].

subsites I and II are represented in yellow and blue, respectively.
2.1.3. Activity
Several mutagenesis and activity studies conﬁrmed the catalytic and active role of
many of the amino acid residues on the structural aspects proposed. IsPETase engineering
assays published to date are summarized in Table S1.
Given the Tg of PET, the polymer is more readily available for enzymatic degradation
at higher temperatures [84]. However, the melting temperature (Tm) of IsPETase was deter-
mined at 48.81 ◦C [81]. For that reason, engineering of PETase to increase enzymatic activity
should be paired with engineering efforts to raise thermal stability and durability [77].
Mutagenesis of the catalytic triad to alanine residues (S160A, H237A, and D206A) con-
sistently resulted in total loss of enzymatic activity, conﬁrming their critical essential role
as the catalytic triad [74,78]. Disulﬁde bridge DS1 disrupting mutations (C203S and C239S)
resulted in very low enzymatic activity and lowered Tm by over 10 ◦C, conﬁrming the es-
sential role of the IsPETase speciﬁc bridge in both activity and stability [74,76]. Most studies
targeting the oxyanion hole and substrate interacting residue Tyr87 with various sub-
strates (PET ﬁlm, PET bottle and BHET monomers) reported diminished activity and lower
amounts of product released [74,76,83], although in one study, a slight activity increase is re-
ported [78]. Engineering of the other oxyanion hole amino acid residue Met161 consistently
resulted in lower PETase activity against all tested substrates [74,76,78,83]. The wobbling
Trp185 has also been the target of engineering studies—replacement of this residue with
an alanine results in highly diminished to total loss of activity [74–76,78]. Residue Ser214,
thought to inﬂuence Trp185 ﬂexibility, has been engineered to a histidine residue (similar
to other enzymes with PET hydrolytic activity), in two different studies. Results were
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 11 of 63
non-consensual, since the mutation has both led to partly compromised activity [76] and
slightly increased activity [78], depending on the study.
Several studies focused on engineering substrate binding residues in an attempt to
increase enzymatic degradation activity. Han et al. [76] mutated Ile208, Trp159, Thr88 to
alanine residues, with consistent decreases in PETase activity, showing the importance of
these residues in catalysis. These ﬁndings were also corroborated by Joo et al. [74].
In addition, Joo et al. [ 74] explored residues from the binding subsite II (W159A,
S238A, N241A) that resulted in activity reductions. To simulate Tf Cut2 binding site,
Ser238 was mutated to phenylalanine (S238F) and Trp159 to histidine (W159H), with drastic
consequences to IsPETase hydrolytic activity. The observation that Arg280 (located in
subsite IIc) presented a protruding shape that seemed to destabilize the binding of PET led
the authors to produce a R280A variant. This mutant presented augmented PET degrading
activity against PET ﬁlm by 22.4% in 18 h and 32.4% in 36 h when compared with the WT
enzyme. The resolved structure (PDB: 5YNS) showed that alanine provided a hydrophobic
and non-protruding cleft, resulting in an extended subsite IIc. Interestingly, even though
Arg280 is ~23 Å away from the catalytic center, this mutation highly affected PETase
activity, since it resulted in structural changes that led to better substrate accommodation.
This observation suggests that key structural changes away from the active site have the
potential to impact enzymatic activity. This ﬁnding inspired the authors in subsequent
mutagenic studies [81,83].
In 2019 [81], the group published a manuscript applying the same rational protein
engineering strategies to explore different mutations, using PET ﬁlm as a substrate. Residue
Pro181 disrupts the enzyme’s secondary structure, suggesting a negative effect on enzy-
matic thermal stability and catalytic efﬁciency. Therefore, the variant P181A was produced,
and resulted in diminished activity at both 30 ◦C and 40 ◦C, besides having a higher Tm
value than WT IsPETase by 0.5 ◦C. After resolving and inspecting the P181A IsPETase
structure (PDB: 6IJ5), it was veriﬁed that the mutation led to a collapse of the catalytic site
since it shifted catalytic Asp206 away from the His237 residue. The authors, inspired by
the structure of Tf Cut2, an enzyme with higher thermal stability than PET, designed a
S121D/D186H double mutant to increase the stability of the β6–β7 connecting loop since
these residues were thought to form an additional hydrogen bond. Indeed, the Tm of this
variant was of 54.85 ◦C, 6 ◦C higher than the Tm of WT enzyme. This mutation resulted in
an activity increase of 2.3- and 2.0-fold after 24 and 72 h, respectively, at 30◦C, and a 3.4- and
4.4-fold after 24 and 72 h, respectively, at 40◦C. The effect on enzymatic activity is likely due
to the increased thermal stability, which allows the enzyme to remain active longer at higher
temperatures. IsPETaseS121D/D186H, inspired by these ﬁndings, was designed to be even
more stable—which proved to be true, since this variant had a measured T m of 56.02 ◦C
and an increased enzymatic activity of 2.2- and 2.6-fold after 24 and 74 h, respectively,
at 30 ◦C, and 4.7- and 6.0-fold at 24 and 72 h, respectively, at 40 ◦C. Even though these vari-
ants increased PETase activity and stability by a fair amount, the authors combined these
ﬁndings with the previous ones and designed two triple mutants—S121D/D186H/R280A
and S121E/D186H/R280A. The measured Tm for these variants were of 56.41 and 57.62 ◦C,
7.6 and 8.81 ◦C higher than WTIsPETase. The activity of these variants was also higher than
those of previously reported enzymes. S121E/D186H/R280A showed a 4.3 and 5.2 higher
fold enzymatic activity after 24 and 72 h, respectively, at 30◦C, and a 9.1 and 13.9 higher
fold after 24 and 72 h, respectively, at 40 ◦C.
Recently, the same group published a third mutagenic study onIsPETase [83]. After
performing molecular docking experiments with a 2-HE(MEHT)4 molecule, several point
mutations on substrate binding residues were designed, inspired by conserved and ob-
served residues in other PET hydrolytic enzyme candidates. Most mutations led to slightly
(Y87F, I208V , S238T) or drastic (T88L, R90S, I208T, G234N) activity decreases. However,
mutations S242T and N246D resulted in signiﬁcant activity increase. For that reason, efforts
to incorporate these mutations into the previously designed triple mutants were developed
and a S121/D186H/N246D/280A variant was designed. Unfortunately, this mutated
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 12 of 63
IsPETase exhibited a decrease in activity and thermal stability when compared with the
previously reported variant. After structural studies, it was discovered that the R280A and
N246D mutations were not compatible and could not be employed simultaneously. There-
fore, triple mutants incorporating each of these variants were designed, and the results
revealed that N246D was the more beneﬁcial mutation for enzymatic activity and thermal
stability. For that reason, a quadruple S121E/D186H/S242T/N246D mutant was produced
(PDB: 6KUS). Both the Tm and hydrolytic activity of these variant were higher than those of
previous enzymes. This variant showed a gradual increase of PETase degradation activity
up to 20 days, meaning a 58-fold higher activity than WT IsPETase at 37 ◦C. These results
are remarkable and extremely promising—a true testament to the potential of rational
protein design.
Austin et al. [75] produced a S238F/W159H double mutant with the goal of converting
the IsPETase binding site into a cutinase-like active site cleft. IsPETaseS238F/W159H
resulted in higher enzymatic activity (evidenced by an increase in product release) and
crystallinity reduction against PET ﬁlm when compared with WT enzyme. To understand
the increase in activity, the authors performed induced ﬁt docking and theorized that the
introduced Phe238 performed stabilizing aromatic interactions with the substrate, as well
as with other amino acid residues in the active site.
The best performing IsPETase variant published to date was developed by Cui
et al. [82] through a novel computational strategy termed GRAPE (greedy accumulated
strategy for protein engineering). GRAPE employs a strategy for optimization of mutations
in a cluster manner, creating several functional variants and selecting the most promising
ones [82]. It is a rational and efﬁcient way to combat the tardy strategy of exploring point
mutations individually and combining them in various manners, requiring experimental
testing at each stage. Initially , the algorithm identified 21 stabilizing mutations; however,
a variant containing all of these mutations proved to be inactive, indicating some of them
were not compatible when employed simultaneously . Then, a clustering method (K-means
algorithm) was used to generate promising combinations of mutations. Several variants
were tested, but DuraPETase (S214H/I168R/W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/
L117F/T140D) was by far the most successful [82]. It had been shown that WT IsPETase
suffers total loss of activity within 24 h at 37 ◦C [81]—DuraPETase, having a much higher
Tm and, therefore, thermal stability, resulted in high activity for longer periods at higher
temperatures. Besides exhibiting a 300-fold activity increase in 10 days incubation with
crystalline PET at 37 ◦C, the variant was active and functional for up to 3 days incuba-
tion at 60 ◦C [82], which is a remarkable achievement. The variants’ ability to degrade
nano and microplastics, one of the major issues for marine environments [ 85], was also
much higher than that shown by WT IsPETase. DuraPETase also presents less speciﬁcity
than the WT enzyme and can degrade other plastics such as polybutylene terephthalate
(PBT) and polyethylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (PEN) [ 82]. The authors solved
the three-dimensional structure of DuraPETase (PDB: 6KY5) at 1.63 Å to understand the
mechanistic and structural attributes responsible for the enhanced activity. The overall
structure of the variant is similar to WT IsPETase, and so was the PET binding mode pre-
dicted through molecular docking studies. The features highlighted as responsible for the
increased hydrolytic activity were novel electrostatic interactions (T140D, I168R, W159H,
S188Q), improved hydrophobic packing (Q119Y, A180I, S214H, R280A, L117F), reduction
of conformational entropy (G165A). L117F and Q119Y provided additional stabilization of
the typical binding mode, similar to the role performed by Trp185, Met161, and Tyr87 in
the WT enzyme [82].
Liu et al. [34] tested IsPETase enzymatic activity under different conditions. Three-
point mutations (S93M, W159F, and N241F) were shown to increase enzymatic degradabil-
ity of p-nitrophenyl esters, contrary to the highly speciﬁc WT enzyme. These mutations
change the hydrophobicity and reduce the steric effects responsible for enzymatic speci-
ﬁcity. IsPETase typically performs best under mild temperature conditions (35◦C) and loses
stability as the temperature increases, accompanied by a decrease in activity. Immobiliza-

tion of the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipitation and glutaraldehyde cross-linkage
resulted in maximum activity from 35 to 45 ◦C and 60% of activity at 65 ◦C. Regarding
physicochemical factors, IsPETase was most active in buffer containing 20% glycerol and
its activity increased as the buffer salt concentration increased. Activity was proportional
to salt concentration from 100 to 500 mM. Na2SO4 was the highest impacting salt on enzy-
matic activity. However,IsPETase was inhibited by organic solvents, protease inhibitors,
and detergents typically used in the industry and laboratory, such as propanol, ethanol,
SDS, Tween 20, PMSF, and Triton X-100. The activity increase under high salt concentrations
was suggested to most likely be due to a potential cation binding-site and anion-binding
site in the enzyme [56].
In order to enhance IsPETase activity and stability, Chen et al. [86] built a whole cell
biocatalyst of PET functionalized on the surface of Pichia pastoris yeast cell. Assays with
PET ﬁlm for 18 h at pH 9 and 30◦C resulted in a 36-fold increase in activity when compared
with individual IsPETase. Activity was determined by measuring the produced amounts of
MHET product. Furthermore, the complex system performed at a stable turnover rate for
seven repeated uses under the same conditions, and was further tested with commercial
highly crystalline PET bottles, having shown degradation ability. This study presented a
promising direction for IsPETase activity increase and wider industrial applicability.
Inspired by the advantages of using microalgae for expression and production of plas-
tic degrading enzymes, Moog et al. [87] employed P . tricornutumfor IsPETase production
and Kim et al. [88] used C. reinhardtii microalgae. In both studies, IsPETase activity with
morphological changes on PET substrate and production of PET degradation metabolites
such as TPA was observed. These studies suggest that using microalgae forIsPETase expres-
sion and introduction in the environment is an attractive and promising strategy, especially
given the natural characteristics of microalgae—their abundance and low maintenance
growth in natural aqueous systems with no endotoxin production [88].
2.1.4. Proposed Mechanism
The structural and mutagenic ﬁndings have led to a catalytic mechanism proposal
for PET degradation by IsPETase. It is consensual that the mechanism follows a classical
serine hydrolase family mechanism, similar to cutinase [ 89]. The only difference seems
to be the role of Trp185, the wobbly tryptophan near the catalytic center. The movement
of this residue is thought to have an essential role in both substrate binding and product
release [90]. The current main mechanistic proposals are presented by the same groups
that resolved the ﬁrst known IsPETase three-dimensional structures. While Han et al. [76]
focused on a detailed proposal on the role of each amino acid residue in the catalytic
triad and the movements of atoms and electrons, Joo et al. [74], inspired by their ﬁndings
on the enzyme’s binding site, proposed a broader mechanistic view, considering the
several possible products of PET hydrolysis. Since both proposals ﬁt together to yield a
complete mechanism, they will be integrated and explained simultaneously in this work
and represented in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Scheme mechanism of IsPETase. 
The presently accepted mechanism initiates with the binding of IsPETase to the sub‐
strate. The shallow cleft on apo‐form enzyme allows for substrate binding onto the protein 
surface [74,76]. This is the beginning of the nick generation step, in which four moieties bind 
the protein—one  to subsite I, where the catalytic reaction takes place, and the remaining 
three onto subsite II [74]. Upon binding, the cleavable ester bond is in optimal position to 
be attacked by Ser160 and stabilized by the oxyanion hole (Met161 and Tyr87) [76]—this  
cleavage leads to a nick in PET, resulting in two PET chains with distinct terminals re‐
leased from each subsite: a TPA‐terminal from subsite I and a hydroxyethyl terminal (HE 
terminal) from subsite II [74]. 
The considered mechanistic proposal suggests the first step to be a charge‐relay sys‐
tem between catalytic residues Asp206 and His237. This system allows His237 to depro‐
tonate the hydroxyl group on Ser160, which becomes a stronger nucleophile and attacks 
the carbonyl group of the PET ester [77]. The attack initiates catalysis and leads to the 
formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate, stabilized by the oxyanion hole. The inter‐
mediate’s negative charge is highly unstable, and breaks down, resulting in the release of 
the first product and in an acyl‐enzyme intermediate [76,77]. A second nucleophilic attack 
by a water molecule (deprotonated by the same His237–Asp206 charge‐relay system) to 
the carbonyl carbon results in the second tetrahedral intermediate. Equally unstable, the 
intermediate breaks down and releases the second product. This step finishes with the full 
regeneration of the catalytic triad, so that another catalytic cycle can begin [76,77]. 
In the terminal digestion step, the two cleaved chains are digested into MHET (and 
BHET, TPA, and EG, in residual amounts) in different ways depending on the terminals 
of each molecule. For the HE terminal PET, once the four moieties were bound to subsite 
I and II, the already described ester bond breakage results in the production of a MHET 
monomer (first product released) and a HE‐PET(n‐1). The digestion of this HE‐PET mol‐
ecule follows the same steps as the first ester bond cleavage process [74]. The TPA‐termi‐
nal PET molecule positions itself in the binding site with the TPA terminal at subsite I and 
the remaining three PET moieties in subsite II. In this case, the cleavage of the ester bond 
produces one TPA molecule (first product) and a HE‐PET(n‐1), which suffers a similar 
Figure 8. Scheme mechanism of IsPETase.
The presently accepted mechanism initiates with the binding of IsPETase to the sub-
strate. The shallow cleft on apo-form enzyme allows for substrate binding onto the protein
surface [74,76]. This is the beginning of the nick generation step, in which four moieties
bind the protein—one to subsite I, where the catalytic reaction takes place, and the remain-
ing three onto subsite II [74]. Upon binding, the cleavable ester bond is in optimal position
to be attacked by Ser160 and stabilized by the oxyanion hole (Met161 and Tyr87) [76]—this
cleavage leads to a nick in PET, resulting in two PET chains with distinct terminals released
from each subsite: a TPA-terminal from subsite I and a hydroxyethyl terminal (HE terminal)
from subsite II [74].
The considered mechanistic proposal suggests the ﬁrst step to be a charge-relay system
between catalytic residues Asp206 and His237. This system allows His237 to deprotonate
the hydroxyl group on Ser160, which becomes a stronger nucleophile and attacks the
carbonyl group of the PET ester [77]. The attack initiates catalysis and leads to the formation
of the ﬁrst tetrahedral intermediate, stabilized by the oxyanion hole. The intermediate’s
negative charge is highly unstable, and breaks down, resulting in the release of the ﬁrst
product and in an acyl-enzyme intermediate [ 76,77]. A second nucleophilic attack by
a water molecule (deprotonated by the same His237–Asp206 charge-relay system) to
the carbonyl carbon results in the second tetrahedral intermediate. Equally unstable,
the intermediate breaks down and releases the second product. This step ﬁnishes with the
full regeneration of the catalytic triad, so that another catalytic cycle can begin [76,77].
In the terminal digestion step, the two cleaved chains are digested into MHET (and
BHET, TPA, and EG, in residual amounts) in different ways depending on the terminals of
each molecule. For the HE terminal PET, once the four moieties were bound to subsite I and
II, the already described ester bond breakage results in the production of a MHET monomer
(ﬁrst product released) and a HE-PET(n-1). The digestion of this HE-PET molecule follows
the same steps as the ﬁrst ester bond cleavage process [74]. The TPA-terminal PET molecule
positions itself in the binding site with the TPA terminal at subsite I and the remaining
three PET moieties in subsite II. In this case, the cleavage of the ester bond produces
one TPA molecule (ﬁrst product) and a HE-PET(n-1), which suffers a similar breakage
as described previously [74]. The different bindings and terminals generated result in a
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 15 of 63
series of PET monomers and dimers that are eventually digested to the ﬁnal products in a
combinatorial manner, leading to the accumulation of four molecules—MHET, TPA, EG,
and BHET. Finally, BHET can be degraded into MHET and EG, and the ﬁnal products of
IsPETase activity are MHET, TPA, and EG [74].
The binding mode proposed by Joo et al. [74], of 4-MHET moieties binding IsPETase
simultaneously, was recently contested by Wei et al. [91]. The authors performed NMR
analysis of amorphous PET at 30 ◦C and observed that the polymer does not acquire the
conformation necessary to ﬁt the docking predictions presented by Joo et al. [ 74] and,
therefore, reject the binding mode and the overall mechanistic proposal based on it. Fur-
thermore, Wei et al. [91] performed comparative activity assays with IsPETase and LCC
at their respective optimal activity temperatures (30 ◦C and 70 ◦C, respectively) for 24 h
and observed a 40-fold higher weight loss of PET material with LCC when compared
with IsPETase. This suggests LCC activity on PET is much higher than that of IsPETase,
which is in disagreement with the original activity reports by Yoshida et al. [52]. Recently,
Joo et al. [92] responded to Wei et al.’s [91] publication, arguing that the docking experi-
ments did not consider temperature and, therefore, it is possible that the 4-MHET moiety
polymer acquires the proposed conformation at higher temperatures. Moreover, the au-
thors argued that even though IsPETase has a low thermal stability, several variants with
higher melting temperatures have resulted in increased activity, which means that at higher
temperatures the proposed binding mode and mechanism are plausible. Even though it
is true that at higher temperatures amorphous PET content increases and, consequently,
so does conformational freedom, it now seems plausible that the proposed binding mode
and mechanism are neither likely nor favorable at a 30 ◦C temperature. This apparent
low availability of PET chains at lower temperatures might also be the reason for the
several reports on lower IsPETase activity than originally described by Yoshida et al. [52].
Similarly, Kawai et al. [93] questioned the classiﬁcation of IsPETase as a PET degrading
enzyme, arguing that PET degradation implies that the amorphous region of the polymer
be attacked ﬁrst, and only then the crystalline region becomes susceptible to hydrolysis.
Therefore, since at 30 ◦C the amorphous content of PET polymer is residual, IsPETase
would not be able to attack the polymer and degrade it in the described manner. Although
further and more expansive studies on IsPETase activity on different PET substrates and
at different temperatures are necessary, it seems too drastic to claim no PET hydrolytic
activity can be attributed to IsPETase, given the exhaustive and multiple studies published,
and hereby summarized on this enzyme. In conclusion, IsPETase activity, mechanism of
action, and power is still not fully consensual, and future studies will be important to
clarify some of the issues raised in recent years regarding IsPETase potential.
2.1.5. Future Perspectives
At this stage, knowledge about thIsPETase structure, function, and mechanism is quite
extensive. Moreover, with the increasing need for PET degrading alternatives, new studies
on this enzyme continue to appear. Several studies have resulted in X-ray structures of
IsPETase with different variations, in terms of mutations and bound-molecules, and pro-
posed what speciﬁc characteristics led to the augmented IsPETase enzyme when compared
with other PET hydrolases. However, and even though several engineered IsPETase vari-
ants present higher Tm values and preserve activity at higher temperatures, and for longer,
these variants are still far from being usable in industrial contexts. Furthermore, the re-
cent doubts cast on IsPETase activity and mechanism posed by Wei et al. [91] and Kawai
et al. [93] highlight the need for additional analysis of this enzyme’s activity and poten-
tial as an effective PET hydrolase. Even so, in line with the generally accepted activity
reports, the strategies developed by Son et al. [83] and Cui et al. [82] constitute a promising
methodology for the development of more active and durable plastic degrading enzymes.
Furthermore, the non-engineering strategies explored by Liu et al. [ 34] represent an in-
teresting preliminary evaluation of IsPETase as a broader plastic degrading enzyme and
introduces valuable information on its performance in industrial settings.

2.2. Ideonella sakaiensis MHETase (IsMHETase)
2.2.1. Discovery
IsMHETase is the second PET hydrolyzing enzyme identiﬁed in Ideonella sakaiensis
201–F6 by Yoshida et al. [52] in 2016. It is an intracellular enzyme with a molecular weight
of 65 kDa and 603 amino acids. According to ESTHER database, IsMHETase is labeled
as a tannase that belongs in the α/β-hydrolase Block X family [ 94]. This superfamily
is comprised not only by fungal and bacterial tannases, but also by feruloyl esterases.
Its properties as a PET biocatalyst were ﬁrstly described by Yoshida et al. [ 52] in 2016,
when it was shown to degrade MHET to EG and TPA, catalyzing the subsequent step of
PET degradation initiated by IsPETase. Later studies conﬁrmed that IsMHETase had no
activity on BHET [77].
2.2.2. Structure
Studies on the IsMHETase structure show that it exists as a monomer [95], where the
catalytic domain adopts an α/β-hydrolase fold, similar to serine hydrolases, and the lid
domain is larger than the average lid domain of α/β-hydrolases. IsMHETase lid domain
is composed of ~240 amino acid residues, while the average length in α/β-hydrolases is
about ~100 residues, as evidenced by Figure 9. The lid domain partially involves the active
site and a Ca2+ binding-site, similar to Aspergillus oryzae FaeB (AoFaeB), known to increase
lid domain stability [96].

resent an interesting preliminary evaluation of IsPETase as a broader plastic degrading 
enzyme and introduces valuable information on its performance in industrial settings. 
2.2. Ideonella sakaiensis MHETase (IsMHETase) 
2.2.1. Discovery 
IsMHETase is the second PET hydrolyzing enzyme identified in Ideonella sakaiensis 
201–F6 by Yoshida et al. [52] in 2016. It is an intracellular enzyme with a molecular weight 
of 65 kDa and 603 amino acids. According to ESTHER database, IsMHETase is labeled as 
a tannase that belongs in the α/β‐hydrolase Block X family [94]. This superfamily is com‐
prised not only by fungal and bacterial tannases, but also by feruloyl esterases. Its prop‐
erties as a PET biocatalyst were firstly described by Yoshida et al. [52] in 2016, when it was 
shown to degrade MHET to EG and TPA, catalyzing the subsequent step of PET degrada‐
tion initiated by IsPETase. Later studies confirmed that IsMHETase had no activity on 
BHET [77]. 
2.2.2. Structure 
Studies on the IsMHETase structure show that it exists as a monomer [95], where the 
catalytic domain adopts an α/β‐hydrolase fold, similar to serine hydrolases, and the lid 
domain is larger than the average lid domain of α/β‐hydrolases. IsMHETase lid domain 
is composed of ~240 amino acid residues, while the average length in α/β‐hydrolases is 
about ~100 residues, as evidenced by Figure 9. The lid domain partially involves the active 
site and a Ca2+ binding‐site, similar to Aspergillus oryzae FaeB (AoFaeB), known to increase 
lid domain stability [96]. 
 
Figure 9. Lid and catalytic domains of IsMHETase in comparison with those of AoFaeB. The cata‐
lytic triad for each enzyme is represented in orange. 
Contrary to IsPETase, IsMHETase has a more heterogenous and acidic surface, re‐
sulting in a lower isoelectric point (5.11) [89]. The enzyme contains five disulfide bonds 
(Cys51–Cys92, Cys224–Cys529, Cys303–Cys320, Cys340–Cys348, and Cys577–Cys599), 
which are conserved in tannase family members [89]. The one binding Cys224 to Cys529 
is in the active site and flanks the catalytic triad, which is formed by Ser225, His528, and 
Asp492, and the oxyanion hole, which is composed of the backbone amide nitrogen atoms 
of Gly132 and Glu226. Due to the properties of disulfide bonds, it is most likely that this 
bond tightens the catalytic triad, increasing IsMHETase stability.

triad for each enzyme is represented in orange.
Contrary to IsPETase, IsMHETase has a more heterogenous and acidic surface, result-
ing in a lower isoelectric point (5.11) [89]. The enzyme contains ﬁve disulﬁde bonds (Cys51–
Cys92, Cys224–Cys529, Cys303–Cys320, Cys340–Cys348, and Cys577–Cys599), which are
conserved in tannase family members [89]. The one binding Cys224 to Cys529 is in the
active site and ﬂanks the catalytic triad, which is formed by Ser225, His528, and Asp492,
and the oxyanion hole, which is composed of the backbone amide nitrogen atoms of
Gly132 and Glu226. Due to the properties of disulﬁde bonds, it is most likely that this bond
tightens the catalytic triad, increasing IsMHETase stability.
Currently, there are nine three-dimensional structures ofIsMHETase, including the
WT enzyme in complexed and apo-form. These structures are summarized in Table 2.

The ﬁrst crystal structures of IsMHETase were determined in 2019 by Palm et al. [80].
The authors showed that IsMHETase binds to MHETA, a non-hydrolyzable substrate
analogue of MHET (PDB: 6QGA), through hydrophobic contacts between the phenyl
ring and α/β-hydrolase residues Phe495, Gly132, and Ala494. In a similar way, the lid
domain residues Phe415, Leu254, and Trp397 also establish hydrophobic contacts with
the phenyl ring. Further studies conﬁrmed the same binding mode with MHET [ 89,95].
Phe415 undergoes an induced-ﬁt conformational change, pointing in the opposite way
(open position) from the active site when the enzyme is in its free form; thus, promoting
substrate binding and pointing towards the active site (closed position) when the enzyme
is bound to a substrate. Arg411, which is sustained by Ser416, Ser419 and the backbone
amide of Gly258, connects the two oxygens of the MHET free carboxylate.
Lastly, Knott et al. [89] solved four structures. Here, the group demonstrated that the
carboxylate motif of MHET establishes hydrogen bonds with Arg411 and Ser416. Just like
Phe415, Gln410 also shows a concerted movement, where the side chain pivots towards
the active site, when Phe415 is pointing in the opposite way from the active site, as can be
seen in Figure 10.

The first crystal structures of IsMHETase were determined in 2019 by Palm et al. [80]. 
The authors showed that IsMHETase binds to MHETA, a non‐hydrolyzable substrate an‐
alogue of MHET (PDB: 6QGA), through hydrophobic contacts between the phenyl ring 
and α/β‐hydrolase residues Phe495, Gly132, and Ala494. In a similar way, the lid domain 
residues Phe415, Leu254, and Trp397 also establish hydrophobic contacts with the phenyl 
ring. Further studies confirmed the same binding mode with MHET [89,95]. Phe415 un‐
dergoes an induced‐fit conformational change, pointing in the opposite way (open posi‐
tion) from the active site when the enzyme is in its free form; thus, promoting substrate 
binding and pointing towards the active site (closed position) when the enzyme is bound

2.2.3. Activity
IsMHETase has a high afﬁnity and activity towards the substrate MHET, resulting
in a K M and kcat of 7.2 µM and 27.6 ± 2.6 s−1 [75,89]. However, the enzyme is inca-
pable of efﬁciently degrading the other PET intermediate BHET, resulting in a k cat of
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 18 of 63
0.0011 ± 0.0002 s−1 [80]. The substitution of the catalytic triad by alanine mutants re-
sulted in total loss of enzymatic activity, conﬁrming their essential role in catalysis [80,89].
The oxyanion hole residue Glu226 was mutated to threonine (E226T). The variant resulted
in a ~50% activity reduction [89]. Having ﬁve disulﬁde bonds, IsMHETase was expected
to have a relatively high thermostability. However, when analyzingIsMHETase melting
temperature, Sagong et al. determined that its Tm value was only 50.61 ◦C.
Several engineering efforts to increase IsMHETase performance and stability were
conducted. The amino acid residue Trp397, reported to be involved in MHET substrate
binding, was replaced by the hydrophobic residue alanine (W397A). The resulting variant
manifested an increase of enzymatic activity at high substrate concentration towards
MHET and MpNPT (mono-4-nitrophenyl terephthalate) and a slight decrease of substrate
afﬁnity of MpNPT [80]. Arg411, reported to establish hydrogen bonds with substrates was
replaced by alanine (R411A), positive charged amino acid lysine (R411K) and polar amino
acid glutamine (R411Q). As expected, the variants R411A and R411Q have low afﬁnity
and activity towards MHET and MpNPT. However, R411K variant has a 1.7-fold activity
increase for BHET as a substrate [80,95].
The residue that undergoes induced-ﬁt conformational change, Phe415, has been mu-
tated to alanine, serine, and histidine (F415A, F415S, and F415H, respectively). Interestingly,
the variant F415H exhibits an increased turnover rate towards MHET and has no effect on
MpNPT, while F415A resulted in a lower turnover rate and afﬁnity towards MHET and
MpNPT and F415S resulted in a lower hydrolysis activity towards MHET [80].
Phe424 is a residue that is located at the inner substrate-binding site and is poten-
tially hindering the optimal BHET binding. Thus, mutagenesis was applied replacing
the residue for glutamine, asparagine, histidine, aspartate, glutamate, threonine, valine,
leucine, isoleucine, alanine, and serine (F424Q, F424N, F424H, F424D, F424E, F424T, F424V ,
F424L, F424I, F424A, and F424S, respectively). Overall, all variants resulted in low turnover
rates against MpNPT and MHET and, as expected, higher turnover rates and activity to-
wards BHET, where F424N, F424V , F424I, and F424Q display better results. The possibility
of IsMHETase having a catalytic tetrad was ruled out when the variant His488 resulted in
an unaltered turnover rate [80].
Knott et al. [89] have an interesting approach when it comes to the lid domain and the
disulﬁde bond presented in IsMHETase. The lid domain of IsMHETase (Gly251–Thr472)
was removed and replaced by the IsPETase loop residues (Trp185–Phe191), which possibly
confer activity against PET. However, the resulting enzyme was unable to degrade PET
and the turnover rate value towards MHET was 1000-fold lower when compared to WT
IsMHETase. The active site disulﬁde bond (Cys224–Cys529) was then removed from similar
lidless IsMHETase variants, being replaced with tryptophan and serine (C224W–C529S)
or histidine and phenylalanine (C224H–C529F). These variants conferred almost a total
loss of activity against MHET, being the kcat values 0.10 ± 0.06 s−1 and 0.06 ± 0.03 s−1,
respectively. Lastly, the group included disulﬁde bonds from PETase-like (G489C/S530C)
and AoFaeB, giving IsMHETase a total of seven disulﬁde bonds. The resulting variant had
a very low activity towards MHET (kcat = 0.16 ± 0.14 s−1). More variants were tested but
failed to express.
Besides the described assays, many other engineering efforts have been done on
MHETase, as summarized in Table S2.
2.2.4. Proposed Mechanism
A proposal for the catalytic mechanism of IsMHETase was made by Knott et al. [89],
based on quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations with 2D
umbrella sampling.
The structures determined by the group suggest that the best ﬁtting mechanism for
IsMHETase hydrolysis is the one characteristic of the serine hydrolase enzymes. According
to this proposal, catalysis involves a two-step reaction, where the formation of an acyl-
enzyme intermediate (acylation) occurs ﬁrst, and is followed by its hydrolytic release.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 19 of 63
For acylation, His528 is thought to deprotonate Ser225, which becomes a nucleophile and
attacks the carbonyl carbon of MHET, resulting in the liberation of EG. This exits the active
site within 4 s of the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate (AEI). The minimum
free-energy path (MFEP) calculated from the C–O bond that was formed between the
MHET carbonyl carbon and Ser225 and the broken MHET C–O bond, predicts an acylation
free-energy barrier ( ∆G‡) of 13.9 ± 0.17 kcal/mol and an overall reaction free energy
(∆Gr) of −5.2 ± 0.04 kcal/mol. The departure of EG allows a better access for water
molecules to interact with charged His528, marking the start of the second step. AEI is
subjected to nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, where His528 deprotonates the
catalytic water and transfers the proton to the catalytic Ser225, regenerating the former for
a new catalytic cycle, thus releasing TPA. The MFEP calculated from the C–O bond that was
formed between MHET and water and the broken AEI C–O bond predicts a diacylation
∆G‡ = 19.8 ± 0.10 kcal/mol and ∆Gr = 2.60 ± 0.07 kcal/mol. This step is thought to be
the rate-limiting step, with a k cat of 7.1 ± 1.1 × 10−2 s−1, while for acylation it is about
1.02 ± 0.28 × 103 s−1 [89]. Overall, the reaction is exergonic (−2.60 ± 0.08 kcal/mol).
2.2.5. Future Perspectives
Many key factors need to be studied for a better understanding of IsMHETase. The en-
zyme’s thermal stability is signiﬁcantly low when compared with the known necessary
values in the industry of plastics, and engineering efforts to solve this issue are essential
for further development. Furthermore, conﬁrmation of the catalytic mechanism is needed,
which provides needed information for the application of mutagenesis, and lastly, develop-
ment of new mutant variants is needed to increase the hydrolytic activity of IsMHETase to
the plastic-degrading industry standard levels.
2.3. Pseudomonas Aestusnigri PETase (PaPETase)
2.3.1. Discovery
PaPETase, commonly known as PE–H, is a PET hydrolase produced by the bacterium
Pseudomonas aestusnigri, ﬁrst identiﬁed by Bollinger et al. [ 97] in 2017. P . aestusnigri, a gram-
negative rod shaped bacteria, is a novel species isolated from a marine area affected by a
large oil spill in the last decade [ 98]. Motivated by the evidence that these bacteria had
polyester degrading activity [99], the bacterial genome sequence [ 100] revealed a likely
hydrolase coding gene [101] that coded for functional PET hydrolase. Wild type PaPETase
actively degrades amorphous PET ﬁlm and BHET to MHET, with no production of TPA.
2.3.2. Structure
PaPETase is composed of 304 amino acid residues, with a total molecular weight of
32 kDa, plus a signal peptide of 25 amino acids. Bollinger et al. [97] solved two PaPETase
structures, summarized in Table 3. The structure revealed a functional monomer with
a conserved α/β-fold composed of a nine β-strand central twisted β-sheet and seven
α-helices on both sides, as represented in Figure 11.

An extended loop region connecting β8–α6 like the one observed in IsPETase [74] was
identiﬁed in PaPETase and is deﬁned by residues 254–259. The amino acid content of this
loop deﬁnes this enzyme as a type IIa PET hydrolytic enzyme. These relevant structural
aspects are represented in Figure 12.

2.3.3. Activity
Bollinger et al. [97] veriﬁed that WT PaPETase degraded BHET and amorphous PET to
MHET, with almost no TPA production registered.PaPETase degradation of PET resulted
in 4.2 (±1.6) mg/L MHET after 40 h at 30 ◦C. No hydrolysis on commercial bottle ﬁlm PET
was observed.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 21 of 63
PaPETase and IsPETase are both deﬁned as Type II PET hydrolyzing enzymes. How-
ever, PaPETase is further classiﬁed as a type IIa enzyme, while IsPETase belongs in group
IIb. This distinction is due to the amino acid content of a structurally conserved extended
loop region made up of six amino acid residues. In PaPETase, these are Gly254, Gly255,
Ser256, Ile257, Tyr258, and Asn259. On the other hand, the IsPETase loop is made up of
Ser242, Gly243, Asn244, Ser245, Asn246, and Gln247. Besides, Tyr250 was identiﬁed as the
equivalent PaPETase residue toIsPETase Ser238, a relevant amino acid inIsPETase catalysis.
PaPETase variants containing single-point and entire loop replacements in these positions
with IsPETase residues were produced and tested for activity against BHET and PET. Vari-
ants G254S, Y258N, N259Q, and the full loop mutation resulted in signiﬁcantly decreased
activity and lower T m than WT enzyme by 5–10 ◦C. PaPETase S256N, I257S, and also
resulted in diminished activity but less drastic lowering of T m, by 1–3 ◦C. Only Y250S
resulted in higher activity against pNPB, BHET, and PET, resulting in a higher production
of MHET than wild type enzyme. Particularly, variant Y250S yielded 5.4 (±0.6) mg/L of
MHET after 48 h at 30 ◦C, higher than the 4.2 mg/L produced by WT enzyme. Variants
Y250S and S256N were active on ﬁlm PET derived from a commercial bottle, unlike WT
PaPETase enzyme, although with a relative low yield.
Structure determination of variant Y250S (PDB: 6SCD) revealed a more accessible
and spacious active site cleft when compared with WT PaPETase (PDB: 6SBN). Two loop
regions (the loop connecting β3–α2, composed of residues 98–104, and loop connecting
β4–α3, made up of residues 123–128) are mostly responsible for these differences. In the
WT enzyme, these loops are parallel to each other in a “closed” conformation, while in the
engineered variant they are shifted against each other, which allows for more space in the
catalytic site. The loops responsible for the tightening of the active site in the WT enzyme
are stabilized by the interaction between Tyr250 and Glu102. Through the disruption of this
interaction, variant Y250S induces structural rearrangements, which enlarge the volume
of the active site cavity from 153 Å3 to 362 Å3, resulting in a deeper and more substrate
accessible cleft, which contributes to increased hydrolytic activity. All mutations explored
in this section are summarized in detail in Table S3.
The enzyme-binding mode was predicted through molecular docking studies with
PET tetramer 2-HE(MHET) 4, MHET, and BHET on both structures. BHET and MHET
were predicted to bind in a groove adjacent to the catalytic site, stabilized by interactions
with Ser256, Ser248, Asp106, and Ser104. This binding position is not optimal for catalysis,
suggesting a necessary conformational change in the active site for interaction between
catalytic serine residue and substrate molecules. Furthermore, no valid binding mode for
2-HE(MHET)4 was found, due to the narrowness of the active site cleft. Molecular docking
with engineered variant Y250S revealed a more favorable binding mode for MHET and
BHET, at an appropriate distance for Ser171 attack. Yet again, no valid binding mode for
2-HE(MHET)4 was obtained.
2.3.4. Proposed Mechanism
Inspired by their structural and computational studies, Bollinger et al. [97] proposed a
mechanism for PaPETase hydrolysis of PET. The proposal suggests a three-moiety substrate-
binding mode—one unit would bind the catalytic site adjacent groove, and the other two
would bridge the distance to the catalytic site, where the third unit would bind at optimal
distance for serine mediated cleavage. The substrate-length dependent catalytic mechanism
is similar to the nick and digestion mechanism suggested for IsPETase.
2.3.5. Future Perspectives
The similarity to IsPETase and increased activity of PaPETaseY250S variant is a strong
argument in favor of the proposed binding mode, yet further validation through experi-
mental and computational studies is required. Furthermore, given PaPETase similarity to
IsPETase, reproducing the successful mutations tested on this enzyme could be a promising
strategy for enhancing PaPETase activity, complemented with computational strategies
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 22 of 63
such as molecular dynamics simulations. However, this mechanistic proposal should be
strengthened by experimental evidence on the binding mode (e.g., three-dimensional struc-
tures of complexed PaPETase), and computational studies on the active site conformational
ﬂexibility through molecular dynamics, in addition to quantum mechanics studies using,
for example, a hybrid QM/MM methodologic approach [102–104].
2.4. LC-Cutinase (LCC)
2.4.1. Discovery
LCC, a cutinase homologue, was ﬁrst isolated in 2011 from a leaf-branch compost
through a metagenomic approach [58]. Even though the source organism for this enzyme
remains to be identiﬁed, it is presumed to be thermophilic bacteria. This assumption results
from the high sequence identity between LCC and bacterial cutinases (in comparison
to fungal cutinases), and the temperature of the compost from which LCC was ﬁrstly
isolated (67 ◦C) [105]. LCC is a secretory protein with high sequence identity to lipases and
cutinases. Speciﬁcally, the highest amino acid sequence identity identiﬁed is to Thermobiﬁda
fusca (57.4%) [58]. The enzyme was found to have hydrolytic activity against various fatty
acid monoesters and is efﬁcient in degrading PET and depolymerizing poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL) [58,106].
2.4.2. Structure
LCC is composed of 258 amino acid residues (amounting to a molecular mass of
28 kDa), plus a 34-residue signal peptide at the N-terminus [ 58,105]. The overall LCC
structural fold belongs to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily and is made up of nine-stranded
β-sheet and eight α-helices [105]. The enzyme was determined to be a monomer in the
absence of substrates [105]. The surface of LCC has been described as highly charged [107].
In the active site, three residues were found to form a catalytic triad (Ser165, Asp210,
His242) and two residues constitute an oxyanion hole (Met166 and Tyr95) [58], as repre-
sented in Figure 13. The catalytic serine residue is found in a nucleophilic elbow, a sharp
turn between strand β5 and helix α5 [105], within a typical GxSxG (GHSMG in LCC)
motif [58,105]. Comparisons with TaCut1, whose binding mode is known, resulted in the
prediction that a hydrophobic patch made up of residues Tyr95, Thr96, Ala97, Phe125,
Tyr127, Met166, Trp190, Thr211, Val212, and Phe243 constitutes a protruding long groove
from the catalytic pocket, accommodating the binding of long-chain substrates [ 105].
Even so, a speciﬁc binding mode remains to be fully understood.

LCC activity was first measured against pNP‐butyrate by Sulaiman et al. [58], to 
determine optimal hydrological pH and temperature. The enzyme exhibited highest ac‐

(with 70% of maximal activity at 30 and 70 °C). Measured activity was not changed in the 
presence of CaCl2 or EDTA. To analyze substrate specificity, several pNP monoesters of 
fatty acids with different lengths acyl chains of 2 to 12 were used as substrates. The en‐
zyme showed preference towards pNP‐butyrate (C4) and almost equal efficiency with 
pNP‐caprylate (C8) and pNP‐hexanoate (C6). Acyl chain lengths above 12 resulted in 
much lower rates—enzymatic  activity decreases as chain lengths of substrate increases. 
The enzyme was found to degrade cutin at a similar rate to T. fusca. 
LCC ability to degrade PCL and PET was also tested by Sulaiman et al. [58]. Specific 
enzymatic activity against PCL was determined to be 300 mg/h/mg enzyme at pH 8.0 and 
50 °C. Regarding PET degradability, the enzyme degraded 1.45 mg of PET film after 24 h

A disulﬁde bond (Cys275–Cys292) is found to anchor the LCC C-terminus to a strand
β9–helix α8 loop, similar to other PET hydrolytic enzymes. This bridge is typically respon-

sible for a higher thermal stability of the enzymes since it exists in thermophilic bacterial
cutinases, but not in fungal cutinases [105].
The currently known three-dimensional structures of LCC are summarized on Table 4.
All structures exist in apo-form, so no crystallographic data of complexed enzymes are
presently available. The ﬁrst structure was solved at the time of enzyme identiﬁcation with
a resolution of 1.5 Å in 2012 by Sulaiman et al. [58], and allowed authors to conﬁrm the
structured features predicted from its sequence and similarity to other enzymes. The re-
maining available structures, deposited in 2019 by Tournier et al. [ 106], are engineered
versions of LCC.

2.4.3. Activity
LCC activity was ﬁrst measured against pNP-butyrate by Sulaiman et al. [58], to deter-
mine optimal hydrological pH and temperature. The enzyme exhibited highest activity
at pH 8.0 (with ~70% of maximal activity at pH 7.0 and 9.5) and temperature of 50 ◦C
(with 70% of maximal activity at 30 and 70 ◦C). Measured activity was not changed in the
presence of CaCl2 or EDTA. To analyze substrate speciﬁcity, several pNP monoesters of
fatty acids with different lengths acyl chains of 2 to 12 were used as substrates. The en-
zyme showed preference towards pNP-butyrate (C4) and almost equal efﬁciency with
pNP-caprylate (C8) and pNP-hexanoate (C6). Acyl chain lengths above 12 resulted in
much lower rates—enzymatic activity decreases as chain lengths of substrate increases.
The enzyme was found to degrade cutin at a similar rate to T. fusca.
LCC ability to degrade PCL and PET was also tested by Sulaiman et al. [58]. Speciﬁc
enzymatic activity against PCL was determined to be 300 mg/h/mg enzyme at pH 8.0 and
50 ◦C. Regarding PET degradability, the enzyme degraded 1.45 mg of PET ﬁlm after 24 h
incubation, resulting in a speciﬁc activity of 12 mg/h/mg enzyme at pH 8.0 and 50 ◦C.
TPA was identiﬁed as the major degradation product, with residual MHET also registered.
No BHET monomers were detected. This means that LCC completely hydrolyses PET to
TPA and EG. This study reported LCC activity to be 230–970-fold higher than that of other
cutinases with PET hydrolyzing activity.
As mentioned, LCC showed highest activity at 50 ◦C. However, the enzyme remains
stable up to 75 ◦C. Sulaiman et al. [105] concluded that activity decreases as temperature
increases above 50 ◦C, even before enzymatic denaturation. To further investigate this,
binding afﬁnity constants (K M) and turnover numbers (k cat) were determined at 30, 50,
and 70 ◦C. KM values were similar, independently of the temperature (0.21–0.24 mM), while
kcat numbers differ with the change in temperature. This means that a lowering in activity
at 60 and 70 ◦C is not due to a decrease in binding afﬁnity but to a decrease in the turnover
number. Using pNP-butyrate as substrate, KM and kcat of LCC are 0.21 mM and 343 s−1 at
50 ◦C, considerably higher than known values for other cutinases. Unlike pNP-butyrate,
PET is a long-chain substrate that interacts with various binding site residues, differing
in this regard from short chain monomers. Activity assays against PET ﬁlm showed that
activity increased at 70 ◦C—optimal enzymatic activity is higher at higher temperatures.
This effect is likely due to changes in crystallinity PET suffers at higher temperatures and
stabilization of the active by the long-chain substrate.
The role of catalytic serine residue Ser165 was conﬁrmed by mutagenesis to alanine
(S165A), leading to an almost total loss of activity [58,106].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 24 of 63
A double mutant disrupting the disulﬁde bridge (C275A/C292A) was produced by
Sulaiman et al. [105] to investigate the predicted stabilizing role of this structural attribute.
Spectroscopy studies showed the overall fold of LCC was not affected by this mutation.
Measurement of denaturation curves showed a destabilization of approximately 15 ◦C
when compared to WT enzyme, enforcing the essential role of the disulﬁde bridge in
thermal stability. LCC(C275A/C292A) measured activity at 30 ◦C was comparable to that
of WT LCC at 50 ◦C, indicating that active site stability is affected by the overall enzymatic
fold stability.
Tournier et al. [ 106] compared LCC activity against commercially available amor-
phous PET with several know PET hydrolyzing enzymes (Tf HCut and BTA-2, FsCut and
IsPETase). LCC outperformed all tested enzymes in PET degradation, proven to be at
least 33 times more efﬁcient with an optimal activity temperature of 65 ◦C. Furthermore,
high thermal stability was conﬁrmed by determination of Tm at 84.7 ◦C. Even so, once again
activity decreased as temperature increased, despite high thermal stability, motivating the
authors to attempt to increase enzymatic stability and activity simultaneously. Molecular
docking and molecular dynamics calculations were performed to predict binding mode
of a 2-HE(MHET)3 chain. Predicted binding site was consistent with the conserved pro-
truding hydrophobic groove previously described, and inspired 11 site-speciﬁc mutations,
with production of 209 novel variants. Of these variants, F243I and F243W resulted in
improved activity, while T96M, Y127G, N246D, and N246M showed similar activity but
higher melting temperature values. In an attempt to further increase thermal activity,
an additional disulﬁde bond (D238C/S283C) was introduced, leading to a Tm of 94.5 ◦C
(increased by 9.8 ◦C) with only 28% loss of activity. Two variants combining the disulﬁde
bridge and the activity increasing mutations were engineered: ICC (F243I/D238C/S283C)
and WCC (F243W/D238C/S283C). ICC and WCC presented similar activity to WT enzyme
but higher melting temperature values. Finally, eight new variants combining ICC and
WCC with previously described T96M, Y127G, N246D, and N246M single-point mutations
were generated. Of these, four variants (ICCG, ICCM, WCCG, and WCCM) resulted
in similar or higher activity than WT-LCC and improved T m up to 13.4 ◦C. Exact mea-
surements for these variants and all known LCC mutated enzymes are summarized in
Table S4. A three-dimensional structure of variant ICCG was solved at 1.14 Å (PDB: 6THT).
Molecular dynamics and MM/GBSA calculations with this structure and 2-HE(MHET)3
showed increased afﬁnity and facilitated productive catalytic binding of substrate, further
conﬁrming the efﬁciency of this variant.
Shirke et al. [ 107] attempted glycosylation to avoid LCC aggregation, under the
rationale that reduced aggregation would result in higher kinetic stability. LCC presented
aggregation tendencies in its native state resulting from ionic interactions. Glycosylation
(covalent binding of an oligosaccharide to protein) may stabilize enzymatic conformation
and impose steric constraints inhibiting protein-protein interactions, reducing aggregation.
Glycosylated LCC (LCC-G) showed higher thermal stability and increased activity against
PET at higher temperatures when compared with non-glycosylated protein. Furthermore,
unlike what had been observed for WT enzyme, with LCC-G activity did not decrease with
increasing enzymatic concentration, but remained constant once a given activity maximum
was attained. LCC-G Tm is reportedly 12 ◦C higher than non-glycosylated LCC.
Yan et al. [108] developed a thermophilic whole-cell biocatalyst with high LCC ex-
pression to efﬁciently degrade PET ﬁlm. Whole-cell biocatalysis allows for simultaneous
enzyme production and hydrolysis in a single step—meaning, the system can produce
functional LCC and degrade substrates simultaneously with consistent reaction conditions.
Clostridium thermocellum (thermophilic anaerobe bacterium with an optimal growth temper-
ature of 60 ◦C) was used to generate a whole-cell biocatalyst with high secretory expression
of LCC at high temperatures. PET hydrolytic activity was registered. Over 60% weight
loss of an amorphous PET sample was observed over a 14-day incubation period, resulting
in a degradation rate higher than 2.2 mg/day, which is higher than previous whole-cell
PET hydrolyzing systems reported. This strategy is frequently simpler, less expensive,
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 25 of 63
and more efﬁcient than biodegradation with puriﬁed free enzymes, and this study is highly
promising for the future of biocatalysts in plastic biodegradation.
2.4.4. Future Perspectives
Although LCC was ﬁrst isolated in 2012, several questions remain to be answered.
The lack of a protein-ligand three-dimensional structure and accurate binding mode char-
acterization hinders the suggestion of a solid catalytic mechanism. Even so, in recent times
this enzyme has received high attention from the scientiﬁc community, given the evidence
of its high-level activity and thermal stability when compared with other PET hydrolases.
The high performance of the few engineered versions developed is promising, and it is
to be expected that further mutagenic and activity studies will be successful in enhanc-
ing enzymatic activity. Furthermore, since LCC is stable at much higher temperatures
than, for example, IsPETase, potential for activity above PET’s glass temperature is highly
attractive.
2.5. Thermomonospora fusca Hydrolase (TfHCut) and Thermomonospora fusca BTA Hydrolase 2
(BTA-2)
2.5.1. Discovery
Tf HCut, Thermomonospora fusca hydrolase, also referred to as TfH, BTA-hydrolase 1
(BTA-1) [109] or Tfu_0883 [110] is a type I PET degrading cutinase-like enzyme. The ability
of T. fusca, a thermophilic ﬁlamentous soil bacterium [ 111], to degrade polyester-like
substrates, was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Kleeberg et al. [109] in 1998 with BTA, a copolyester of
1,4-butanediol, TPA, and adipic acid.
The initial ability to degrade BTA earned Tf HCut the alternative name of BTA-1 [112].
Another enzyme expressed by T. fusca also showed BTA and PET degradation activity and
was therefore termed BTA Hydrolase-2 (BTA-2). Even though this enzyme has received
considerably less attention than BTA-1, they share 92% amino acid identity and the genes
that express these proteins are nearly identical [112].
Tf HCut was later identiﬁed, puriﬁed, expressed, and characterized as a thermophilic
hydrolase with ability to degrade aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters [ 113]. The different
names this enzyme is known as are due to the uncertainty in classifying it as a lipase or
cutinase. When Chen et al. [ 110] identiﬁed speciﬁc cutinase-like activity, they renamed
Tf HCut as Tfu_0883, and to this day both designations, as well as BTA-1, are used.
Speciﬁc PET degrading activity was ﬁrst shown by Müller et al. [51] with two different
PET samples—commercial bottle PET and PET-B in pellets. Tf HCut ability to hydrolase
PET was further analyzed and enhanced by Silva et al. [55] and Then et al. [114].
2.5.2. Structure
Tf HCut is composed of 261 amino acids with a total molecular weight of 28 kDa [113].
It is, similar to most PET hydrolases, a serine hydrolase with Ser170, His248 and Asp216 as
the catalytic triad [110]. Catalytic Ser is found in a G-H-S-M-G conserved sequence [113].
in a nucleophilic elbow [ 110]. A homology model built by Chen et al. [ 110] based on
SeLip, a S. exfoliates lipase, revealed an oxyanion hole formed by Met171 and Tyr100,
and conﬁrmed the α/β-hydrolase general fold up made up of a central β-sheet with α-
helices on both sides. These ﬁndings were later conﬁrmed by Silva et al. [ 55] that also
produced a homology model with a similar protocol.
Kleeber et al. [113] predicted an exposed and not buried binding site, facilitating the
attack to the cleavable ester bonds, which Silva et al. [55] later conﬁrmed.
The only three-dimensional structure of Tf HCut available was recently released by
Dong et al. [115] (PDB: 5ZOA). This structure resolved at 1.54 Å contains all the 261 amino
acids, suggests the enzyme is a functional monomer, and conﬁrmed the catalytic triad and
oxyanion hole residues predicted by homology years earlier. The authors were unable to
obtain structures crystalized with BHET and several cutin mimics. Therefore, molecular
docking and molecular dynamics calculations were employed to study the active site and
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 26 of 63
binding mode. Molecular Docking with an oligo-polyester (C24H42O8, CAS number 10061-
30-0) that mimics cutin revealed that part of the substrate was inserted in the hydrophobic
shallow groove and part was exposed to the bulk solvent environment. An ester bond
was located near the catalytic triad, in an optimal binding mode for catalysis to occur.
Furthermore, the docked ligand formed hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion hole residues.
Given the bulky residues located at either side of the binding groove, it was theorized
that availability for substrate accommodation was not optimal. Therefore, these and other
structural ﬁndings revealed by the structure were used as rationale for protein engineering
and activity assays, described below.
Visual inspection of the available PDB structure and comparison with similar PET
degrading cutinases suggests a disulﬁde bridge between residues Cys299 and Cys281.
2.5.3. Activity
Kleeberg et al. [113] showed that the ability of Tf HCut to degrade BTA was enhanced
by the addition of pectin, peptone, and tryptic soy broth to the medium, and was unaf-
fected by the addition of polysaccharides. Maximum growth temperature for T. fusca was
determined at 55 ◦C, and maximum Tf HCut activity was registered at 65 ◦C and pH 6.0 to
6.5, which is a typical behavior for extracellular enzymes. Activity rapidly decreased at
70 ◦C, likely due to enzymatic denaturation. Ester bond cleavage ability of Tf HCut was
demonstrated with several triglycerides of varying chain lengths. This activity was higher
for shorter chain polymers, decreasing as length increased. Hydrolytic activity on aliphatic
polyesters (PCL, commercial biodegradable plastic Bionelle, and SP3/13 and Bayer Tir
1874) was also demonstrated, but no degradation of PHB was attained. Activity assays
and predicted characteristics derived from sequence determination led to the deﬁnition of
Tf HCut as a lipase, since speciﬁc cutinase-like activity was not conﬁrmed.
PET hydrolytic activity was analyzed by Müller et al. [ 51] using two different PET
samples—commercial bottle PET and a PET-B sample obtained as a pellet. Rates of depoly-
merization were similar for both samples over a three-week incubation period. The erosion
rate was 8–17 µm week−1 per ﬁlm side. Degradation of PET was performed at 55 ◦C,
and DSC experiments conﬁrmed low crystallinity of the PET samples used at this tempera-
ture, facilitating enzyme binding and activity rates. Assays with PHB and PBT were also
conducted, with no sample weight loss registered.
Silva et al. [ 55] engineered two new variants of Tf HCut with different active site
residues, as a strategy to promote active site enlargement (I218A) and to increase hydropho-
bicity (Q132A/T101A). PET degrading activity was measured with PET fabric at 60 ◦C and
activity rate was determined by measuring amounts of TPA release, since the enzyme can
fully degrade PET to TPA. The engineered variants degraded PET to TPA with a two-fold
activity increase when compared with the WT enzyme. The mutants achieved a higher
catalytic efﬁciency and higher levels of protein adsorption than WT Tf HCut, probably due
to the increased active site binding space and enforced hydrophobic character. Further
catalytic assays revealed Q132A/T101A to be the better-performed mutant, with a much
higher catalytic rate than WT enzyme.
Chen et al. [110] determined esterase, cutinase, and lipase activity of Tf HCut. Esterase
activity was measure with pNPB as a substrate at pH 8.0. Cutinase activity was determined
in similar conditions using apple cutin as a substrate, and for lipase activity measurement,
triolein was selected as substrate. Enzymatic thermal stability was explored by repeating
pNPB activity assays at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60◦C. Through veriﬁcation of high
cutinase-like activity, Tf HCut, at the time known mostly as TfH or BTA-1, was renamed
Tfu_0883 and considered a cutinase.
Then et al. [114], inspired by the effect Ca2+ had on LCC and Tf Cut1 activity, explored
the activity ofTf HCut and BTA-2 in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The PET degrading
assays were performed on PET ﬁlm substrate at pH 8.5 and 50 ◦C for 48 h on a shaker
at 125 rpm. The effect on the cations on PET hydrolase activity was dependent on the
reaction temperature. At 55 ◦C, the activity was similar to the WT enzyme. On the other
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 27 of 63
hand, activity at 65 ◦C was only possible in the presence of Ca 2+ or Mg2+ ions. Tf HCut
had a 4.5-fold activity increase at 65 ◦C in the presence of the ions when compared to
the WT enzyme performance at 60 ◦C. Molecular dynamics simulations to determine
probable ion binding sites were performed, and concluded that Ca 2+ was likely to bind
Asp174 and Asp204, via the carboxyl groups, and to Gly205 via the amide hydrogen.
Mg2+ was suggested to bind to ﬁve residues—Glu253, Asp174, Asp246, Glu26, and Thr41.
Given the positive effects that these cations have on the activity and thermal stability,
and the recently known structure of Ca2+ bound Tf HCut, further computational studies
through molecular dynamics, free energy, and QM/MM calculations could be performed
to understand PET-degradation activity.
Recently, Dong et al. [115], inspired by the Tf HCut structure solved (PDB: 5ZOA),
performed several mutations to increase activity on pNPB and tomato cutin. Two sets of
bulky residues were mutated to alanine residues. The ﬁrst set included residues near the
catalytic triad that might hinder availability of substrate to the catalytic residues. The sec-
ond set (contained residues near the substrate-binding site in order to increase accessibility
for longer chain substrates. In the assays with pNPB, Y100A, T247A, and F249A from the
ﬁrst set and L130A and I253A from the second set resulted in enhanced activity. Regard-
ing the tomato cutin experiments, only L130A and I253A (and the combined mutation
L130A/I253A) resulted in activity increase. Therefore, molecular docking experiments
with the L130A/I253A variant were performed, revealing that the mutation resulted in
better substrate accommodation and increased binding site ﬂexibility. These mutations and
their effects on enzymatic performance are summarized in Table S5.
Alisch-Mark et al. [116] showed Tf HCut ability to modify PET ﬁbers surface, some-
thing essential for biodegradation in the textile industry. The role of the catalytic triad was
demonstrated by Chen et al. [110]; the effect of PMFS (mechanism-based serine hydrolase
inhibitor) on enzymatic activity was measured, with almost no activity registered. Fur-
thermore, the mutation of catalytic serine to alanine also resulted in total loss of activity,
conﬁrming the predicted catalytic activity.
Tf HCut is an extracellular acting enzyme, as demonstrated by Su et al. [117], by show-
ing hydrolytic activity of phospholipids. The over-expression of the enzyme in various
organisms, to achieve optimal quantity and purity levels, has been achieved in several
studies [112,118,119], which is a promising experimental milestone for further enzymatic
engineering studies.
2.5.4. Proposed Mechanism
Chen et al. [110], inspired by the predicted homology model, suggested a classical
α/β-hydrolase catalytic mechanism performed by the catalytic triad (Ser170, His248,
Asp216) stabilized by an oxyanion hole (Met171 and Tyr100) and involving formation of
two tetrahedral transition states and an acyl-enzyme intermediate.
2.5.5. Future Perspectives
Tf HCut was the ﬁrst PET hydrolase identiﬁed and characterized, and has inspired
countless organism and enzyme identiﬁcation campaigns, leading to the discovery of
many PET degrading cutinases. The many designations that the enzyme has acquired
through the years hinder a good overview of activity and performance. On the other hand,
the multiple available studies mean there is more available information on this enzyme than
for many other potential PETase-like enzymes. The recent deposition of a three-dimensional
structure coupled with experimental evidence of Tf HCut ability to fully degrade PET to
TPA are promising factors. A deeper understanding of the PET or PET-like substrate
binding mode to Tf HCut through molecular docking [120–124] and molecular dynamics
simulations [125–130] could be used not only to understand the molecular rationale behind
the performance of the many variants developed, but also to rationally inspire the design
of further mutations.

2.6. Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 Cutinase (SvCut190)
2.6.1. Discovery
Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 Cutinase (SvCut190, also referred to as Cut190) is
a PET degrading-enzyme from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190, ﬁrst identiﬁed for its
PETase-like activity by Kawai et al. [56] in 2014. S. viridis is a thermophilic bacterium with
an optimal temperature for growth of 55 ◦C [131]. The enzyme contains 304 amino acids
residues and is only active in the presence of Ca2+ ions.
2.6.2. Structure
SvCut190 exists as a monomer and adopts an α/β-hydrolase fold, with a central
twisted β-sheet of nine β-strands and six α-helices. No lid domain was identiﬁed covering
the active site. Short helices α1, α4, η1, and η2 have also been identiﬁed. A conserved
pentapeptide sequence motif and a typical catalytic triad of the lipase family, composed
of Ser176, His254, and Asp222, which are located on the loops β5–α5, β7–α6, and β8–α7,
respectively, have been observed [132]. Residues Phe106 and Met177 have been shown
to deﬁne an oxyanion hole. A disulﬁde bond (Cys287–Cys302) that connects the terminal
loop to the α8–β9 loop and three Ca2+ binding sites, which are located on the β1–β2, β7–
β9 and β6–β7 loops, respectively [133] are also present. After binding to Ca2+, the enzyme
undergoes large conformational changes, which induces the pocket to open providing an
easier access for substrate binding [133]. Oda et al. [134] identiﬁed the residues involved
in the three Ca2+ binding sites. The Ca 2+ binding site located in the β1–β2 loop (Site 1)
has an important role on enzymatic activity, and is made up of Ser76, Ala78, and Phe81.
Site 2 is in the β7–β9 loop, contributes to thermostability, and involves the amino acids
Glu220, Asp250, and Glu296. Site 3, located in theβ6–β7 loop, contains amino acid residues
Asp204 and Thr206, and is related to both activity and thermostability.
The ﬁrst crystallographic structures were determined in apo-form by Miyakawa
et al. [132] in 2014, complexed with Ca2+ (1.75 and 2.35 Å resolution, PDB: 4WFJ and 4WFK,
respectively) and without Ca2+ (1.45 Å resolution, PDB: 4WFI). The three structures have a
mutation on the position 226, where Ser226 was replaced with proline (S226P). In a later
report, the same group determined the crystal structures of SvCut190S176A/S226P/R228S
bound to Ca2+ and Zn2+ (1.60 and 1.22 Å resolution, PDB: 5ZNO and 5ZRQ, respectively)
and complexed with Et-succinate and Et-adipate (1.34 and 1.40 Å resolution, PDB: 5ZRR
and 5ZRS, respectively) [133]. When the mutated enzyme is complexed with Et-succinate,
conformational changes on β3–α2 and β4–α3 loops (designated as the engaged form) are
observed. Trp107, which forms a hydrogen bond with Arg135 in the ligand free form,
undergoes induced-ﬁt conformational change and interacts with the ligand ester group.
Other SvCut190 crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank are summarized
and characterized in Table 5.

2.6.3. Activity
The role of Ser176 as a catalytic triad amino acid residue was conﬁrmed when the its
mutation to alanine (S176A) totally abolished the enzymatic activity [133]. Kawai et al. [56]
determined the Tm of WT SvCut190 at 55.4 ◦C.
To date, several engineering efforts have been performed on SvCut190. As summa-
rized in Table S6, TaEst119 has a conserved proline in position 219 (corresponding to 226 in
SvCut190), and due to the similarities of SvCut190 to TaEst119, the variant S226P was
developed, resulting in an enhancement of T m value by 3.7 ◦C (59.1 ◦C) and enzymatic
activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate. The positively charged Arg228 can potentially
form a salt bridge with a negatively charged residue and inﬂuence the reaction. Therefore,
Kawai et al. [56] replaced Arg228 with neutral serine, producing the variant S226P/R228S
in the presence of Ca 2+ (300 mM), which resulted in an increase of thermostability and
activity (76.8 ◦C and 0.896 mg/mL, respectively). Thr262 was mutated to the positively
conserved lysine, to improve the salt-bridge formation, which is reported to contribute
to thermal stabilization. The resulting triple mutation (S226P/R228S/T262K) also in the
presence of Ca2+ (300 mM) demonstrated an activity increase but a lower T m (76.2 ◦C)
when compared to the double mutant. F106Y mutation appears to cause a steric hindrance
of the additional hydroxy group with the catalytic residues, Ser176 and His254 [56].
Mutations on the residues around the catalytic triad, oxyanion hole and the Ca 2+
binding sites were built to analyze the effects on the catalytic activity, allowing for a
better understanding of the enzyme [ 137]. In this study, a three-dimensional model
was developed based on the ﬁrst reported structure SvCut190S226P , which was further
mutated to SvCut190S226P/R228S (kcat = 27 ± 0.2 s−1; K M= 0.089 ± 0.001 mM) with
PBSA as substrate. The residues neighboring the oxyanion hole (Phe106, Thr107, Gln138,
and Trp201) were mutated to alanine and several other amino acid residues. Overall,
the resulting variants decreased the kcat value, except for Q138D variant (increased kcat to
61 ± 0.3 s−1), and increased afﬁnity towards PBSA, except for W201A and Q138D [ 137].
Senga et al. [ 135] further mutated SvCut190S226P/R228S by deleting the C-terminal
residues (Lys305/Leu306/Asn307). The variant resulted in a k cat of 100 s −1 and a K M
of 0.282 mM.
Using the same SvCut190S226P/R228S 3D model [137], Oda et al. [134] applied in-site
mutagenesis to the residues involving the Ca 2+ binding sites, using PBSA as substrate,
as 3D modeling revealed similar behavior between PBSA and PET. When compared to
other cutinases, SvCut190 lacks an amino acid in the β1–β2 loop (Site 1); therefore, a serine
was introduced between Phe77 and Ala78 (78Ser). This amino acid addition remarkably
enhanced the enzymatic activity (kcat = 151 s−1); however, its expression was exception-
ally low and the thermostability was slightly decreased. In Site 2, a disulﬁde bond was
introduced (D250C–E296C), which signiﬁcantly increased Tm to 79 ◦C.
Hantani et al. [ 138] analyzed the catalytic reaction of SvCut190S226P/R228S and
SvCut190S226P/R228S/Q138A/D250C–296C towards BHET. Kinetic parameters could not
be calculated for the later variant due to low solubility of BHET. The ﬁnal product of BHET
degradation was MHET, with no further conversion to TPA. As for Site 3, many mutations
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 30 of 63
were engineered being N202H the variant with better resulting kcat and thermostability.
SvCut190S226P/R228S/Q138A/D250C–E296C/Q123H/N202H is the most thermostable
variant of the enzyme determined to date (Tm = 85.7 ◦C). In the presence of 2.5 mM of Ca2+
the variant showed a decrease in the thermostability of the enzyme to 82.6 ◦C [134].
Kawai et al. [56] and Oda et al. [138] performed studies on PET hydrolysis, where dif-
ferent PET ﬁlms were utilized as substrates. In both studies,SvCut190S226P/R228S showed
the highest activity between 60 and 65 ◦C. The ﬁrst group analyzed the degradation rate of
PET-GF and PET-S by SvCut190S226P/R228S at 63 ◦C for 3 days. The weight losses mea-
sured from the molar ratio of TPA included in PET and TPA produced from PET showed
a degradation rate of approximately 10.9 ± 1.5% and 26.2 ± 0.6% for PET-GF and PET-S.
The analyses by hybrid ion trap/time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry coupled with liquid
chromatography (LC-IT-TOF-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
detected TPA as the major peak, and no BHET was detected, presumably due to further hy-
drolysis to TPA [56]. Later, Oda et al. [134] studied the degradation rate products of PET-GF
(6.3% of crystallinity) by SvCut190226P/R228S and variants with the highest melting points
at 65 ◦C and 70 ◦C, respectively, for 3 days. SvCut190226P/R228S showed a degradation
rate of 16.0 ± 1.4 and expectedly the variants showed higher degradation rate at 70 ◦C,
being the variant with the highest thermostability (SvCut190S226P/R228S/Q138A/D250C–
E296C/Q123H/N202H) the variant with the highest degradation rate (33.6± 3.0), resulting
in an increase by over 30%, compared with that of SvCut190 at 63 ◦C.
2.6.4. Proposed Mechanism
Kawabata et al. [137] proposed a catalytic mechanism through molecular docking of
partial structure PET model and PBSA substrate with the variant S226P/R228S. His254 de-
protonates Ser176, which interacts with the carbon of a carbonyl group by nucleophilic
attack, thus splitting the ester bond and forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate. This inter-
mediate is subjected to nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, which is deprotonated by
His254, and the resulting proton is transferred to Ser225, creating the conditions for a new
catalytic cycle.
2.6.5. Future Perspectives
SvCut190 has great potential as a PET biocatalyst due to high thermostability of
the resulted variants. However, its activity is much too low for its usage in the plastic-
degrading industry. Therefore, computational conﬁrmation of the catalytic mechanism
should be developed for a better understanding of the reaction.
2.7. Thermobiﬁda Genus Cutinase 1 and Cutinase 2 (Cut1 and Cut2)
2.7.1. Discovery
Cutinase 1 (Cut1) and cutinase 2 (Cut2) are two enzymes from the Thermobiﬁda genus
species, which includes Thermobiﬁda fusca, Thermobiﬁda alba, and Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica.
The enzymes are identical, differing in only 18 amino acid residues. While T. fusca and
T. cellulosilytica are both thermophilic bacteria and can grow at temperatures up to 55 ◦C
and 45 ◦C, respectively,T. alba is a mesophilic bacterium that can only grow at temperatures
up to 37 ◦C. All of these cutinases have the same number of amino acids (262), apart from
Cut2 of Thermobiﬁda fusca (261). These cutinases were ﬁrstly reported as PET biocatalysts
by Herrero et al. [139] in 2011.
2.7.2. Structure
Cut1 from Thermobiﬁda fusca DSM44342 (Tf Cut1 (DSM44342), aka Thf42_Cut1) has
high similarity with Thermobiﬁda fusca KW3 (Tf Cut2), aka ThfKW3_Cut2), differing only in
four amino acids [140]. However, structure for Tf Cut1 is yet to be determined.
The Cut2 from Thermobiﬁda fusca KW3 (Tf Cut2) was the ﬁrst cutinase with a resolved
crystallographic structure, determined by Roth et al. [141] in its free state with resolutions of
1.4 Å and 1.55 Å and complexed with the inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF)
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 31 of 63
with resolution of 1.44 Å in 2013. All crystallographic structures known for Tf Cut2, TcCut2,
and TcCut1 are summarized in Table 6.

The enzyme adopts a classical α/β-hydrolase fold with a central nine-stranded β-
sheet enveloped by 11 α-helices on both sides. The catalytic triad is in a cleft on the surface
of the enzyme and is comprised of Ser130, His208, and Asp176. The oxyanion hole is
formed by Met131 and Tyr60. The residues Ala55 to Ala65, Leu175 to Pro180 and His208 to
Pro211 form the active site [141]. Trp155 and Phe209 interact with the aromatic rings of the
dimer PET model, 2PET.
A highly ﬂexible region is located around the amino acids Arg245 to Gly247 and the
disulﬁde bond Cys241–Cys259 is located near this region [141]. The relatively high melting
point (71.2 ± 0.2 ◦C) may be explained by the presence of this disulﬁde bond and the
optimized hydrogen bond network.
The crystallographic structures of Cut1 and Cut2 from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica
(TcCut1 and TcCut2, aka Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2, respectively) in their free state were
later determined by Ribitsch et al. [142], with resolutions of 1.5 Å for TcCut1 (PDB: 5LUI)
and 1.45, 2.2, and 1.9 Å for TcCut2 (PDB: 5LUK, 5LUJ, and 5LUL, respectively) in 2016,
as described in Table 6. Overall, it is identical to the previously reportedTf Cut2, apart from
the number of α-helices (11 vs. 10) that ﬂanks the β-sheet. The catalytic triad and oxyanion
hole of both cutinases are the same, namely Ser131, His209, Asp177, Tyr61, and Met132,
respectively.
Cut1 from Thermobiﬁda alba (TaCut1 aka Tha_Cut1) and TcCut1 have high similarity,
differing in only four amino acids in the outside region of the active site [140]. However,
no crystallographic structures have been determined so far.
2.7.3. Activity
Both Cut1 and Cut2 from the previously described organisms are able to degrade
PET ﬁlms. The major product released from the PET hydrolysis by TcCut1 and Tf Cut1
(DSM44342) was TPA [139]. However, MHET was the major product released by TcCut2,
revealing a limiting rate on the MHET hydrolysis to TPA [139]. In addition, an inhibitory
effect of BHET on PET hydrolysis by TcCut1 has been reported [143]. Activity of TcCut1 on
semi-crystalline and amorphous PET ﬁlms (24 and 12% crystallinity, respectively) demon-
strated that the reaction is faster towards semi-crystalline PET [143].
Tf Cut2 also demonstrated low capability for MHET hydrolyzation to TPA [144–146].
Kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis of MHET and BHET substrates were measured
by Barth et al. [ 144]. The low k cat and high K M towards MHET (0.31 ± 0.01 s−1 and
7.33 × 10−3 ± 3.62 × 10−4 mol L−1, respectively) conﬁrm the inhibitory effect of MHET.
BHET also has inhibitory effects resulting in k cat and K M of 26.76 ± 0.85 s −1 and
3.97 × 10−2 ± 2.50 × 10−3 mol L−1, respectively.
Wei et al. [145] demonstrated that when Tf Cut2 is complexed with the dimer PET
model 2PET, the residues Gly62, Thr63, Ile178, and Ile213 become in close vicinity to the
substrate. The studies of enzymatic degradation calculated with PET amorphous ﬁlms
weight loss revealed that the variant G62A had the highest weight loss of amorphous PET
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 32 of 63
ﬁlms (42.6 ± 2.9%), while the WT resulted in a weight loss of only 15.9 ± 1.8%. The variant
I213S resulted in the highest thermal stability [145].
The substitution of Asp174, Asp204, and Glu253 with arginine conﬁrmed their roles
as residues related to the Ca2+ binding site in Tf Cut2 [114]. The resulting variants (D204A
and E253A) increased Tm values from 71.2 ± 0.2 ◦C to 85.2 ± 0.5 ◦C and 86.2 ± 0.8 ◦C.
Substitution of the Ca 2+ binding site residues of Tf Cut2 to replicate a disulﬁde bond
was studied by Then et al. [ 147]. The resulting variant (D204C–E253C) increased the
melting point to 92.8 ± 0.3 ◦C. Further engineered variants (D204C/E253C/D174R and
D204C/E253C/D174R) increased the PET ﬁlms weight loss (25.0 ± 0.8% and 24.2 ± 0.8%,
respectively), when compared to WT Tf Cut2 (16.3 ± 2.2%). The other hydrolase from
the same strain Tf Cut1 (KW3) has a Tm value of 68.6 ◦C ± 0.6 ◦C and its thermostability
increases in the presence of Ca2+ [114]. These mutations are summarized in Table S7.
TcCut1 and TcCut2 differ in only 18 amino acids; however, the hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms
by TcCut1 was much more effective than that of TcCut2 [139]. Herrero et al. [139] observed
electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity differences in two regions. The ﬁrst region of
TcCut1 is composed of Ser19, Asn29, Val30, and Glu65, whereas in TcCut2 it is composed of
the positively charged Arg19 and Arg29, Ala30, and Gln65. The second region of TcCut1 is
made up of Ala183 and Lys187, whereas in TcCut2 the residues are the more hydrophobic
Leu183 and Arg187, as evidenced by Figure 14. In a later study, the group applied in-site
mutagenesis in regions 1 and 2 of TcCut2 to resemble TcCut1 [148]. The double mutant
R29N/A30V proved to be the most active variant, with a four-fold activity enhancement
for amorphous PET ﬁlms degradation.

The hydrolysis of a PET model bis(benzoyloxyethyl) terephthalate (3PET) by TaCut1,
which has high similarity to TcCut1, resulted in a product release of mainly MHET and
HEB, and also marginal amounts of TPA and BA [140]. Other methods for enhancement
of enzymatic activity of TcCut1, such as fusion of binding domains, covalent fusion to
hydrophobins, and ultrasound have also been reported [149–151].
2.7.4. Future Perspectives
The Cut1 and Cut2 of the Thermobiﬁda genus have great potential as biocatalysts.
A better understanding of the interaction between the PET substrate and the cutinases is
needed for PET hydrolysis enhancement. Therefore, studies on the enzymatic mechanism
and in-site mutagenesis should be developed.

2.8. Fusarium oxysporum Cutinase 5 (FoCut5a)
2.8.1. Discovery
FoCut5a is a cutinase 5 from Fusarium oxysporum, an ascomycete fungus found mainly
in soil [ 152]. FoCut5a was ﬁrstly expressed and characterized in 2015 by Dimarogona
et al. [153], which conﬁrmed FoCut5a ability to degrade PET into MHET.
2.8.2. Structure
The enzyme adopts the typical α/β-hydrolase fold with a central β-sheet of 5 parallel
β-strands and 11 α-helices, and has a molecular weight of 23 kDa and 230 amino acids [153].
The catalytic triad is made up of Ser121, His189, and Asp176 (Figure 15A). The catalytic
serine is located in the nucleophilic elbow, between strand β5 and helix α5. References on
the residues comprising the oxyanion hole are yet to be reported [153,154], but an analysis
of its X-ray structure suggests these residues are Ser43 and Gln123 (Figure 15A).

bility. 
Two disulfide bonds are present in the enzyme. The first disulfide bond (Cys32–
Cys110) connects the loop α1–β1 to loop α4–β3 and the second (Cys172–Cys179) connects 
the loop β5–α8 to helix α8, where the catalytic triad residue Asp176 is located [153,154]. 
The polar residues Lys63 and Tyr64, located at the end of helix α2, form a hydrogen bond 
with Asp209, which is in the helix α11 (Figure 15B). The interaction between the two is 
thought to increase the overall thermal stability of the enzyme. Furthermore, the helices 
α10 and α11 are bridged by the hydrogen bond between the amino acid Gly193 and the 
backbone oxygen of Leu190. Due to repulsive forces between the Glu165 and Asp166, the 
stability of the enzyme can be compromised [153] (Figure 15C). 
So far, only one crystallographic structure of the enzyme has been reported, having 
been determined by Dimarogona et al. [153] in its free state with a resolution of 1.9 Å 
(PDB: 5AJH), in 2015.

(C) View of the two repulsing amino acid residues Glu165 and Asp106, thought to hinder enzyme

Two disulﬁde bonds are present in the enzyme. The ﬁrst disulﬁde bond (Cys32–
Cys110) connects the loop α1–β1 to loop α4–β3 and the second (Cys172–Cys179) connects
the loop β5–α8 to helix α8, where the catalytic triad residue Asp176 is located [153,154].
The polar residues Lys63 and Tyr64, located at the end of helixα2, form a hydrogen bond
with Asp209, which is in the helix α11 (Figure 15B). The interaction between the two is
thought to increase the overall thermal stability of the enzyme. Furthermore, the helices
α10 and α11 are bridged by the hydrogen bond between the amino acid Gly193 and the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 34 of 63
backbone oxygen of Leu190. Due to repulsive forces between the Glu165 and Asp166,
the stability of the enzyme can be compromised [153] (Figure 15C).
So far, only one crystallographic structure of the enzyme has been reported, having
been determined by Dimarogona et al. [153] in its free state with a resolution of 1.9 Å (PDB:
5AJH), in 2015.
2.8.3. Activity
The optimal parameters for FoCut5a activity are 40 ◦C, pH 8 and 1.92 mg enzyme
loading per gram of PET fabric [153–155]. Nikolaivits et al. [154] studied the inﬂuence of
different FoCut5a expression hosts on the formation of the disulﬁde bond and therefore the
enzymatic thermostability. The expression of the cutinase gene in the oxidative cytoplasm
of Origami 2 competent cells resulted in the highest thermostability, with a melting point
of 44.9 ± 0.5 ◦C.
This cutinase has been shown to hydrolyze the pNP esters pNPA, pNPB, and pNPL
where the hydrolysis of pNPB resulted in the highest catalytic activity and afﬁnity
(kcat= 111.9 ± 10 s−1 and KM= 0.7 ± 0.2 mM) [153].
PET hydrolytic activity was conﬁrmed when model 3PET was used as a substrate [153].
FoCut5a was able to hydrolyze the model substrate, being the products released TPA,
BHET and benzoic acid (BA) (0.19, 0.20 and 1.09 mM, respectively). The enzyme was
conﬁrmed to further hydrolyze BHET to MHET, when BHET was used solely as the
substrate, resulting in a 46% abundance of MHET. The cutinase successfully depolymerized
PET fabrics, resulting in a release of 26 µM TPA and derivatives [153]. The application of
in-site mutagenesis studies is yet to be reported.
2.8.4. Future Perspectives
FoCut5a is a promising enzyme for PET hydrolysis application, albeit, determination
of the X-ray structure complexed with PET substrate should be attempted to enable a better
understanding of the key residues involved in the reaction and the catalytic mechanism. In-
site mutagenesis could also be applied for enhancement of both activity and thermostability.
2.9. Humicola insolens Cutinase (HiCut)
2.9.1. Discovery
HiCut, aka HiC, is a cutinase produced by Humicola insolens, a thermophilic fungus
capable of growing at temperatures up to 58◦C [156], ﬁrst reported in 1964. HiCut ability to
degrade PET substrates was ﬁrst reported by Ronkvist et al. [157] in 2009. Castro et al. [158]
determined that HiCut has the highest activity towards PET bottle when compared to other
15 biocatalysts, being the amount of released products 29 times higher than the second-best
enzyme, RoLip (commonly known has RoL).
2.9.2. Structure
The enzyme presents an α/β-fold with a central ﬁve-stranded β-sheet, which is sur-
rounded by six α-helices on both sides. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 32 kDa and
194 amino acids. The central β-sheet is well conserved in the lipase-cutinase family [159].
The conserved catalytic triad is composed of Ser105, His173, and Asp160 [ 159]. In the
hydrophobic loops adjacent to the active site, three amino acid residues (Leu66, Leu167,
and Ile169) may be restricting the entrance of larger substrate [160].
According to UniProtKB [ 161], HiCut also exhibits two disulﬁde bonds (Cys17–
Cys94 and Cys156–Cys163). References on the residues comprising the oxyanion hole are
yet to be reported, but upon visual inspection of the X-ray structure, residues Gln106 and
Ser28 likely make up this motif. The two structures available for HiCut are described in
Table 7. The enzyme in its free form (resolution of 3 Å, PDB: 4OYY) and in complex with
mono-ethyl phosphate (resolution of 2.05 Å, PDB: 4OYL), determined by Kold et al. [159],
in 2014.

4OYY 3 - - 2014 [159]
4OYL 2.05 Mono-ethyl phosphate - 2014 [159]
2.9.3. Activity
The enzyme has a relatively high thermostability, showing maximum initial activity at
80 ◦C and pH 8.5 and becomes totally inactive at 90◦C, presumably due to thermal-induced
denaturation [157]. However, Hunsen et al. [162] and Fabbri et al. [163] suggest an optimal
temperature of 65–70 ◦C. High selectivity of HiCut’s towards long-chain alcohols and acids
was revealed, with conversion rates up to 90% when using a 12-chain alcohol, 60 to 70%
when using an 8 carbon-chain acid and only 30% when using small acid chains [163,164].
Ronkvist et al. [157] determined that HiCut fully catalyses low crystallinity PET (7%
crystallinity) to TPA at 70 ◦C, resulting in a 97 ± 3% weight loss in 96 h. However, Castro
et al. [158] and Carniel et al. [165] determined a limiting rate on the MHET hydrolysis to
TPA when PET and its intermediate BHET were used as substrates. A combination of
HiCut with an enzyme that can properly hydrolyze MHET into TPA (CaLipB) was therefore
implemented, resulting in a 7.7-fold increase of TPA concentration [165]. Expectedly, HiCut
reveals a decrease in activity when exposed to higher crystallinity PET ﬁlms, as determined
by Ronkvist et al. [157], where HiCut activity decreased 10-fold when exposed to PET ﬁlm
with 35% crystallinity compared to the PET ﬁlms with 7% crystallinity.
While studying the enzymatic hydrolysis of two phthalic acid based polyester coatings
(PTa and PTb) by HiCut and TlLip, Greimel et al. [166] determined that only the cutinase
from Humicola insolens was able to hydrolyze the substrates. The unexpected inactivity by
TlLip indicates that the ester bonds between TPA and EG are more accessible to enzymatic
hydrolysis than ester bonds between phthalic acid and trimethylolpropane (like in PTa and
PTb).
Quartinello et al. [167] developed a two-step system, involving depolymerization and
enzymatic hydrolysis. The ﬁrst step is the depolymerization of the virgin PET ﬁber, where
the optimal conditions were set to be 250 ◦C and 39 bar. The process completely reduced
the substrate to powder consisted of 85% TPA and small PET oligomers. The second step
is the introduction of a catalytic enzyme (HiCut) to further hydrolyze the PET oligomers,
which resulted in a total of 97% TPA production.
In addition to temperature and pH, other conditions were shown to increase the
hydrolysis product concentrations. Carniel et al. [168] studied the hydrolysis reaction of
post-consumer PET by HiCut and determined that the unbuffered reaction (alkaline water
pH 8.95) with NaOH 0.5 M to control the reaction pH showed a 2.39-fold improvement in
the released monomers when compared to the Tris-HCl-buffered (pH 8.95). The tempera-
ture was constant for both reactions (50 ◦C). Eugenio et al. [169] determined that the best
ﬁtting enzymatic concentration for optimal reaction rate is about 1.68 mgprotrein mL−1.
Many other methodologies that lead to increased enzymatic activity are reported, in-
cluding DNA immobilization [170] and optimization of process variables [171]. No studies
regarding enzymatic activity and thermostability enhancement towards PET substrate
with application of in-site mutagenesis are yet available. However, variants of the en-
zyme are reported to improve the enzymatic activity of cellulose acetate deacetylation and
polyacrylates and poly(vinyl acetate) hydrolase [172,173].
2.9.4. Future Perspectives
Although HiCut has promising results for PET degradation, due to higher thermosta-
bility and activity when compared to other enzymes, it is still far away from being usable
in a large scale. Even though no mechanistic proposals for HiCut degradation of PET-like
substrates is available, the existence of a three-dimensional structure complexed with a
ligand provides an important starting point for molecular docking and molecular dynamics
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 36 of 63
simulation studies. Studies on the key residues involved in the reaction should be devel-
oped for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism. To increase the enzymatic
activity, studies with in-site mutagenesis in these residues should be applied. Kinetic
parameters such as kcat and KM should be calculated.
2.10. Fusarium solani Cutinase (FsCut)
2.10.1. Discovery
FsCut or FsC, Fusarium solani cutinase, is a fungal cutinase [ 174] and type I PET
hydrolase. This fungus is a widely spread soil pathogen [175]. It was ﬁrst characterized by
Lin et al. [176] in 1980, and several structural and biochemical studies have followed.
2.10.2. Structure
FsCut is a 230 amino acid residue protein with a molecular weight of 23 kDa. The en-
zyme is a compact functional monomer with a typical α/β-serine hydrolase overall fold.
It is made up of a central β-sheet with ﬁve parallel β-strands and ﬁve α-helices on ei-
ther side [174,177,178]. The residues Ser120, His188 and Asp175 make up the catalytic
triad [174], stabilized by oxyanion hole residues Gln121 and Ser42 [177]. Catalytic serine is
inserted in a Gly-Tyr-Ser-Gln-Gly motif in aβ-hairpin [174].
The extended binding site is mostly hydrophobic, but solvent accessible. It is partly
covered by two thin “bridges”, formed by amino acid residues Leu81, Val184, Leu182,
and Asn84 [174,177,178]. A conserved water molecule bound to Leu179, Ala185, Ile183,
and catalytic residue Asp175 has a role in properly orienting side-chains and facilitating
catalysis [177]. Binding site amino acids have overall higher B factor than the remaining
protein residues, suggesting conformation changes and rearrangements upon binding and
catalytic attack [174].
The 46 three-dimensional structures of FsCut available on PDB are summarized in
Table 8. There are currently ﬁve apo-form and ﬁve complexed WT structures available,
and thirty-six engineered variants. The ﬁrst structure was deposited by Martinez et al. [174]
in 1994, at 1.25 Å (PDB: 2CUS). In the same year, a structure complexed with a covalent
inhibitor (PDB: 2CUT) revealed the displacement of a conserved water molecule upon
binding, with no other structural aspects affected [177]. Longhi et al. [ 179] produced 31
FsCut variants with different mutated residues and complexed ligands, and studied the
effects of these alterations on the enzymatic structure, having concluded that the binding of
a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue did not induce structural rearrangements. The same
authors [180] later obtained a complex of FsCut with a triglyceride analogue similar to the
ﬁrst tetrahedral intermediate (TI) in the reaction pathway (PDB: 1CEX), further conﬁrming
the unaffected overall structural and catalytic fold.

2.10.3. Activity
Heumann et al. [183] have demonstrated FsCut’s ability to hydrolyze BHET, and to
modify the surface of synthetic PET fabric with positive yields.
In order to enhance enzymatic activity towards PET, Araújo et al. [184] tested several
active site point mutations that aimed to enlarge the binding site, providing a better ﬁt for
larger polymer chains. Through computational studies of molecular dynamic simulations
and free energy calculations with a substrate mimicking the TI, ﬁve point mutations were
predicted as favorable for activity and model TI stabilization—L182A, V184A, L189A, L81A,
and N84A. Experimental testing of these variants with PET fabric as a substrate for 48 h at
pH 7.5 and 37 ◦C showed L182A, L81A, and V184A resulted in increased activity, while
L189A and N84A resulted in activity decreases. Subsequent structural and hydrophobicity
studies conﬁrmed that the better performing variants resulted in a less restrained active
site, allowing for better accommodation of substrate and higher stabilization of TI, without
affecting the hydrophobicity and therefore the grip on PET fabric surface.
Ronkvist et al. [ 157] studied the effect of PET crystallinity percentage on cutinase
activity and compared FsCut with HiCut and PmCut. The substrates were two samples of
PET—low crystallinity PET (7%) and a bi-oriented sample of PET with 35% crystallinity.
Of the three enzymes tested, FsCut showed the lowest afﬁnity for PET and the poorer ther-
mal stability, with a maximum activity at 50 ◦C, far from PET Tg. FsCut ability to degrade
PET decreased as sample crystallinity increased, as expected. The mild temperature for
FsCut maximum activity combined with its rapid denaturation as temperature increases
constitutes a meaningful impairment to its PET degrading action.
Erbel et al. [ 185] tested FsCut activity on PET fabrics and 3PET in the presence of
Triton X-100 and plasticizer N,N-diethyl-2-phenylacetamide (DEPA). Plasticizers enhance
polymer chain mobility by reducing Tg and inner chain interaction. Even though Triton-X-
100 had no effect on FsCut ability to modify PET, DEPA resulted in enhanced hydrolysis
rates, further conﬁrming that FsC biggest limitation in degrading PET is the polymer’s
high Tg and low chain mobility at the enzyme’s optimal temperature.
2.10.4. Future Perspectives
FsCut, similar to many known and described cutinases, is regarded as a promising PET
hydrolase. However, thermal stability and low optimal activity is a main issue in the appli-
cation of this enzyme for efﬁcient PET depolymerization. There have been no mechanistic
proposals for the FsCut degradation mechanism of PET. Since the structure and activity
of this enzyme is extensively characterized, several computational studies could be conﬁ-
dently employed to resolve the enzymatic mechanism, particularly QM/MM [102–104].
The existence of high-resolution three-dimensional structures with a TI model substrate
is a relevant clue for mechanistic studies and could be used to validate a QM/MM study.
Finally, strategies to improve thermal stability should be employed.

2.11. Candida antarctica Lipase B (CaLipB)
2.11.1. Discovery
CaLipB, CalB, or lipase B from Candida antarctica, was ﬁrst isolated in 1988 [186,187],
and has been the target of various studies. CaLipB is a multi-purpose enzyme, with various
roles attributed to it, such as resolution of alcohols [188] and amines, desymmetrization
of diacetates and diols, synthesis of intermediates for substrate, and pharmaceuticals
production [189]. This large number of applications arises because CaLipB presents a high
thermal stability, low substrate speciﬁcity, high enantioselectivity, and stability in diverse
solvents [190].
2.11.2. Structure
CaLipB is made up of 317 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 33 kDa.
Optimal catalytic pH was determined to be 7. In addition, CaLipB was shown to remain
stable in aqueous media from pH 3.5 to 9.5 [191]. The overall structure follows the typical
α/β-globular protein fold. The catalytic site contains the typical Ser-His-Asp triad (Ser105,
His224, Asp187), stabilized by an oxyanion hole (Thr40 and Gln106). Ser105 is introduced
in a TWSQG motif, differing from the typical motif characteristic of PET hydrolyzing
enzymes [192]. CaLipB exists as a monomer, mostly composed of β-sheets surrounded by
α-helices, similar to the typical α/β-serine hydrolase fold [188,192].
The catalytic triad is located at the carboxy-terminal hedge of the main parallel β-
sheet, with Ser105 located in a tight turn between α4 and β4. His224, located in helix
α9 with a protruding sidechain into the active site, is at optimal catalytic distance from
Asp187, located in a turn after the sixth strand. Ser105 is surrounded by polar residues
(Thr40, Asp134, Gln157) that form hydrogen bonds and are fully accessible to solvent
interactions [192]. Stauch et al. [191] revealed the existence of a conserved water molecule
shared between catalytic His224 and Ser105, while Strzelczyk et al. [189] identiﬁed a water
bound to catalytic Asp187 and nearby Ser227. The binding pocket is divided into two
compartments with different afﬁnities—one that accommodates the acyl moiety and the
other that preferably binds the substrate alcohol part [188,189,192]. The alcohol-binding
subsite is further divided into a large and a medium pocket [193].
There are currently 25 CaLipB three-dimensional structures in the Protein Data Bank,
including apo forms of the enzyme and forms co-crystallized with ligands of relevance.
These are summarized in Table 9.

Uppenberg et al. [ 188,192] solved the ﬁrst X-ray structures of this enzyme in 1992.
These structures revealed that all six cysteine residues in the protein form disulﬁde bridges:
Cys22–Cys64 and Cys216–Cys258 contribute to the overall protein fold, and Cys293–
Cys311 stabilizes the enzymatic C-terminal. A possible N-glycosylation site at Asn74 was
also identiﬁed.
From the resolved structures, amino acid sequence, and similarity to other well
categorized lipases, the existence of a lid domain responsible for an open and closed
conformations was predicted [192]. However, the proven existence of a lid and a precise
characterization of it was only achieved in 2016, when Stauch et al. [191] resolved a two-
monomer structure representing both conformations at 0.91 Å (PDB: 5A71). The two
monomers, A and B, assume different conformations. Monomer A takes on the classical
open conformation, similar to previously reported structures, while monomer B reveals a
huge conformational change. Residue range Leu140–Leu147 is an α-helix (α5) in monomer
A, but in monomer B, it becomes an unfolded loop, corresponding to a closed conformation.
The closing of the lid hinders substrate accessibility to the binding site, preventing catalytic
activity.
Regarding the binding mode, Uppenberg et al. [ 192] obtained CaLipB in complex
with Tween 80 (PDB: 1LBT), a monoester prior to hydrolysis, which remained highly
exposed to solvent and did not disrupt the overall fold; and a complex with a phosphonate
inhibitor (PDB: 1LBS), which revealed disruption of the optimal distances for catalysis.
Qian et al. [194] solved a suicide-inhibitor-complexed structure after circular permutation,
and Xu et al. [197] resolved a complex structure with a synthesized stereoisomer product
in order to understand stereoselectivity of CaLipB.
2.11.3. Activity
CaLipB activity towards PET is not consensual [ 51,199,200]. The most promising
report was the evidence found by Carniel et al. [ 165] that CaLipB has MHETase and
BHETase activity, efﬁciently degrading BHET and MHET to TPA and EG. These studies
were conducted synergistically with HiCut (as represented in Figure 16), which showed
high afﬁnity and activity in PET depolymerization. Using BHET as a substrate, Carniel
et al. [165] screened 10 commercial enzymes and identiﬁed CaLipB and HiCut as potential
biocatalysts. Preliminary screening was conducted at pH 7.0 and 37 ◦C and revealed that
CaLipB led to a fast conversion of BHET to MHET and, consequently, MHET to TPA with
higher extent than previously tested lipases. Activity assays with PET bottle after different
pre-treatments showed a better performance achieved byHiCut than CaLipB. After 3 weeks
of activity on the PET bottle and pellet, a maximum of 0.4% weight loss, but almost total
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 41 of 63
degradation of MHET and BHET to TPA, was achieved when the reaction environment
was high on these substrates. Therefore, further studies to enhance CaLipB activity as a
promising MHET and BHET hydrolyzing enzyme are essential to conﬁrm this enzyme as
an essential player in the PET bioremediation landscape. To our knowledge, there are no
reported studies aiming at enhancing CaLipB hydrolysis of PET, MHET, and BHET.

pre‐treatments showed a better performance achieved by HiCut than CaLipB. After 3 
weeks of activity on the PET bottle and pellet, a maximum of 0.4% weight loss, but almost 
total degradation of MHET and BHET to TPA, was achieved when the reaction environ‐
ment was high on these substrates. Therefore, further studies to enhance CaLipB activity 
as a promising MHET and BHET hydrolyzing enzyme are essential to confirm this en‐
zyme as an essential player in the PET bioremediation landscape. To our knowledge, there 
are no reported studies aiming at enhancing CaLipB hydrolysis of PET, MHET, and BHET. 
 
Figure 16. Cumulative action of HiCut and CaLipB to fully degrade PET to TPA and EG. 
Due to the diverse applications of CaLipB, countless engineering efforts towards in‐
creased activity and higher stability have been reported with various substrates, unrelated 
to PET or plastic polymers in general [201–207]. The ability of CaLipB to play an essential 
role in polyester and bioplastic synthesis has also been the target of interesting activity 
and catalytic studies [208,209]. 
Even though these studies are not specific to PET, some may result in valuable sug‐
gestions and strategies. Qian et al. [194] redesigned CaLipB by circular permutation, a 
technique that changes connectivity and sequence order but does not affect overall fold. 
Circular permutation occurs naturally throughout organism evolution and is frequently 
used as an artificial engineering technique. Variant CalB‐cp283 was generated and its 
three‐dimensional structure solved (PDB: 3ICV). Activity assays showed increased activ‐
ity and a high‐rate enhancement against pNP‐butyrate, and structural studies suggest 
CalB‐cp283 suffered dimerization. Xie et al. [195] followed the rationale of mutating resi‐
dues within 10 Å and a high B factor and obtained a double mutant D223G/L278M (PDB: 
4K5Q) with higher activity against pNP‐caprylate and higher stability than the WT protein. 
2.11.4. Future Perspectives 
The recent discovery that CaLipB has degradation activity towards BHET and 
MHET and can act synergistically with PET degrading enzymes that are unable to com‐
plete degradation (such as IsPETase and HiCut), is a very promising approach. However, 
so far, no significant additional studies have been conducted. Given the high number of 
three‐dimensional CaLipB structures, many of them recent and with high‐resolution val‐
ues, computational mechanistic studies aimed at understanding CaLipB as probable (yet 
disputed) role as a PET degrading enzyme could be conducted. Specific understanding of 
the binding mode of these molecules and mechanistic solving and characterization would 
allow for the development of engineered variants with enhanced activity. CaLipB has re‐
ceived little attention from the community as a PET degrading enzyme, but its promising 
experimental behavior justifies further investment. 
   
Figure 16. Cumulative action of HiCut and CaLipB to fully degrade PET to TPA and EG.
Due to the diverse applications of CaLipB, countless engineering efforts towards
increased activity and higher stability have been reported with various substrates, unrelated
to PET or plastic polymers in general [201–207]. The ability of CaLipB to play an essential
role in polyester and bioplastic synthesis has also been the target of interesting activity and
catalytic studies [208,209].
Even though these studies are not speciﬁc to PET, some may result in valuable sug-
gestions and strategies. Qian et al. [ 194] redesigned CaLipB by circular permutation,
a technique that changes connectivity and sequence order but does not affect overall fold.
Circular permutation occurs naturally throughout organism evolution and is frequently
used as an artiﬁcial engineering technique. Variant CalB-cp283 was generated and its
three-dimensional structure solved (PDB: 3ICV). Activity assays showed increased activity
and a high-rate enhancement against pNP-butyrate, and structural studies suggest CalB-
cp283 suffered dimerization. Xie et al. [195] followed the rationale of mutating residues
within 10 Å and a high B factor and obtained a double mutant D223G/L278M (PDB: 4K5Q)
with higher activity against pNP-caprylate and higher stability than the WT protein.
2.11.4. Future Perspectives
The recent discovery that CaLipB has degradation activity towards BHET and MHET
and can act synergistically with PET degrading enzymes that are unable to complete
degradation (such as IsPETase and HiCut), is a very promising approach. However,
so far, no signiﬁcant additional studies have been conducted. Given the high number
of three-dimensional CaLipB structures, many of them recent and with high-resolution
values, computational mechanistic studies aimed at understanding CaLipB as probable (yet
disputed) role as a PET degrading enzyme could be conducted. Speciﬁc understanding of
the binding mode of these molecules and mechanistic solving and characterization would
allow for the development of engineered variants with enhanced activity. CaLipB has
received little attention from the community as a PET degrading enzyme, but its promising
experimental behavior justiﬁes further investment.
2.12. Thermobiﬁda alba Esterase 1 (TaEst1)
TaEst1 is a 260 amino acid residues cutinase from Thermobiﬁda alba identiﬁed in
2013 [45,210]. TaEst1 has an increased activity on pNPB of two-fold in comparison with to
TaEst119 and is able to fully depolymerize 3PET to TPA and hydrolase the surface of PET
ﬁlm [45,210].
Efforts to obtain a three-dimensional structure of TaEst1 have been reported by Kita-
dokoro et al. [211], but no resolved structure has been deposited on the PDB database to
date. Thumarat et al. [210] built a homology model based on a known structure ofTaEst119,
and identiﬁed the catalytic triad as residues Ser169, His247, and Asp215 and the oxyanion
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 42 of 63
hole as made up of Met170 and Tyr99, similar to TaEst119. The two enzymes differ in
the residues of a loop near the substrate binding-site, which might explain the higher
activity of TaEst1 compared with TaEst119. The overall fold is consistent with the typical
α/β-serine hydrolase structure, with a central, nine-stranded parallel β-sheet ﬂanked by
eight α-helices on either side.
Kitadokoro et al. [211] determined the Tm of TaEst1 to be 61 ◦C. Activity assays with
pNPB in the presence and absence of Ca2+ cations at pH 6.0 and 50 ◦C revealed that in the
presence of calcium ions Tm increased up to 76 ◦C. Inspired by a conserved valine residue
in most cutinases, variant A68V was tested and resulted in higher activity.
Thumarat et al. [210] engineered several TaEst1 variants and tested them for activity
on pNPB substrate, as described in Table S8. The better performing variant (A68V/T253P)
was later tested with 3PET and PET ﬁlm as substrates. Variants with point mutations and
combined modiﬁed residues A68V , T253P , and M256K were constructed based on typical
cutinase residues absent in TaEst1. Variant A68V resulted in increased activity (similar to
what had been observed by Kitadokoro et al. [211], but no increase in Tm. Therefore, variant
A68V/T253P was constructed since proline residues typically stabilize overall enzymatic
structure. This double mutant resulted in higher activity and an increased Tm of 79 ◦C in
the presence of calcium. Furthermore, TaEst1A68V/T253P conserved 100% of activity at
50–55 ◦C after 1 h, 90% of activity at 60 ◦C for 1 h and 70% activity at 65 ◦C for 30 min.
Therefore, this variant showed remarkably improved activity and thermal stability when
compared with WT TaEst1. Variants A68V/M259K and A68V/T253P/M259K resulted in
similar activity to the A68V/T253P double mutant but lower Tm.
Following these results, Thumarat et al. [ 210] tested the best performing variant,
A68V/T253P double mutant, with 3PET and PET ﬁlm as substrates in the presence of Ca2+
at pH 7.0 and 50 ◦C for 3 h. After 4 min of incubation, 3PET was depolymerized to TPA and
EG almost to completion, conﬁrming TaEst1 PET depolymerization activity. In the assays
with PET ﬁlm, even though no weight-loss was recorded, evidence of hydrolyzation of
ester bonds in the ﬁlm surface with release of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups was observed.
Less efﬁciency in PET ﬁlm degradation compared with assays with substrate 3PET is likely
due to the higher crystallinity of PET, and less availability for enzymatic degradation.
Further efforts to increase TaEst1 Tm to higher value than the T g of PET are essential to
enhance enzymatic activity and applicability in large-scale PET depolymerization.
2.13. Thermomyces lanuginosus Lipase (TlLip)
2.13.1. Discovery
Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TlLip, aka TlL) is produced by a basophilic fungus
previously known as Humicola lanuginosa discovered by Tsiklinskaya et al. [212] in 1889.
TlLip consist of a single chain of 269 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 31 kDa and
an isoelectric point of 4.4, being ﬁrstly puriﬁed in 1972 by Arima et al. [213]. The enzyme
was applied in various industrial areas [214–217], including in the hydrolysis of PET, ﬁrstly
reported by Brueckner et al. [218] in 2008.
2.13.2. Structure
The enzyme adopts theα/β-hydrolase fold with a centralβ-sheet containing eight pre-
dominantly parallel β-strands, and ﬁve α-helices. The catalytic triad is made up of Ser146,
His258, and Asp201 and the oxyanion hole by Ser83 and Leu147 [219,220]. Three disulﬁde
bonds (Cys22–Cys268, Cys36–Cys41, and Cys104–Cys107) have also been reported.
The residue Glu87 was suggested to take part in the electrostatic stabilization of the
lipase active open-lid conformation and Trp89 was proposed to play an important role in
hydrolytic reactions by interacting with the substrate [221–223].
Derewenda et al. [220] determined the ﬁrst crystallographic structure of TlLip in its
free state with a resolution of 1.84 Å (PDB: 1TIB), in 1993. Presently, 25 crystallographic
structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. All structures are summarized
and characterized in Table 10.

2.13.3. Activity
The optimal activity temperature and pH of TlLip were reported to be 45 ◦C and 7,
respectively [230]. This enzyme was shown to be stable for 20 h at 60 ◦C and 1 h at 65 ◦C,
losing its activity at temperatures higher than 70 ◦C, being the melting temperature around
65 to 70 ◦C [227,230].
In-site mutagenesis in the amino acid Ser146 (S146A) resulted in an inactive form of
the enzyme, conﬁrming its role as part of the catalytic triad [231]. Replacing Glu87 with
alanine (E87A) and Trp89 with phenylalanine and glutamate (W89F and W89E, respectively)
resulted in lower speciﬁcity towards tributyrin, suggesting that these residues play a role in
the substrate binding [221,222]. The mutation of Ile186 and Ile255 to cysteine was applied to
introduce a new disulﬁde bond (I186C/I255C). The resulting disulﬁde bond decreased the
thermostability by 5 ◦C, meaning that the addition of a new disulﬁde bond destabilizes the
secondary structure of TlLip [227]. These engineering efforts are summarized in Table S9.
TlLip was able to degrade both amorphous and semi-crystalline PET ﬁbers (5 and
40% crystallinity, respectively) releasing about two times more TPA and MHET from
amorphous ﬁbers. However, the amount of product released is much too low when
compared with Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinase [218]. Interestingly, the enzyme released higher
amounts of MHET than TPA, whereas the cutinase released similar amounts of both
products. This shows that both enzymes have different reaction mechanisms [218].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 44 of 63
The hydrolysis of the PET model substrate 3PET resulted in the release of TPA, BHET,
MHET, BA, and HEB [ 185]. When in presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100,
conformational changes involving lid-opening of the lipase occur, resulting in a 7-fold
increase of the overall degradation products [ 185]. When incubated solely with BHET,
the lipase did not liberate signiﬁcant amounts of TPA, showing that TlLip preference
towards the other intermediate product MHET [185].
2.13.4. Future Perspectives
TlLip is a promising enzyme for application in PET degradation. However, the activity
and thermostability of the wild type enzyme are too low for direct usage in the plastic-
degrading industry. Determination of its structure complexed with PET substrate or its
analogue could provide a better understanding of the key residues involved in the reaction
and their conformation, yielding important clues for a rational understanding of its catalytic
mechanism. Calculation of the kinetic parameters kcat and KM for the wild type enzyme
and different mutants, following in-site mutagenesis would also be of great importance for
enhancing the activity and thermostability of this enzyme.
2.14. Thermobiﬁda fusca Carboxylesterase (TfCa)
2.14.1. Discovery
TfCa is a highly hydrophobic carboxylesterase produced byThermobifida fusca, a meso-
thermophilic bacterium known for its ability to degrade cellulose. This organism produces
many biocatalysts, being a powerful resource for synthetic polymerdegradation [112,139,144].
The enzyme’s properties as a PET biocatalyst were firstly described by Oeser et al. [232] in
2010.
2.14.2. Structure
Tf Ca is composed of 497 amino acids and exists as a monomer. Identical sequences
with other carboxylesterases are also observed [233]. The catalytic triad includes amino acid
residues Ser185, His415, and Glu319. The catalytic serine is inserted in a motif containing
residues Glu184 and Ala186 [233]. There are currently no X-ray structures available for this
enzyme, so no further structural information is known.
2.14.3. Activity
Tf Ca presents a low isoelectric point (4.8) and a thermostability between 30 and
50 ◦C [233]. When incubated with pNPB at temperatures above 55 ◦C, the enzyme com-
pletely loses its activity [234]. However, after immobilization of Tf Ca on SulfoLink resin
(where an oligopeptide of glycine-serine-cysteine was added at the C-terminus), the en-
zyme exhibited an improvement of thermostability, maintaining 94% of its initial activity
at 60 ◦C [234]. The carboxylesterase is capable of hydrolyzing PET nanoparticles at 50 ◦C
and cyclic PET trimers at an optimum temperature of 60 ◦C and pH 6 [232,233]. The prod-
ucts released towards cyclic PET trimers are 1,2-ethylene-mono-terephthalate-mono(2-
hydroxyethyl terephthalate (EMT) (95%), MHET (3%), and BHET (2%). The enzyme also
showed a KM value of 0.5 ± 9% mM for cyclic PET trimers. Belisário–Ferrari et al. [235] an-
alyzed the hydrolysis of 2PET and BHET by Tf Ca. The hydrolysis of the PET intermediate
resulted in a 3.5-fold higher kcat (0.35 min−1) and a 2-fold higher KM (0.085 mL/mg) when
compared to 2PET (0.10 min −1 and 0.042 mL/mg of k cat and KM, respectively). These
results revealed a preferential hydrolysis of smaller esters by the carboxylesterase
Barth et al. [234] built a dual enzyme system with LCC and Tf Ca, employing the latter
for the hydrolysis of MHET to TPA. In fact, the dual system resulted in a 2.4-fold increase
of product release (10.42 ± 1.85 mM) when compared with that ofTf Cut2 (4.44 ± 0.57 mM).
A signiﬁcant increase of product release was also reported when the enzyme was coupled
with Tf Cut2 [234]. Mutations on the sequence motif (E184Q, A186M, and E319D) of the
carboxylesterase resulted in activity losses up to 88%, conﬁrming their important roles for
the catalytic activity [233], as described in Table S10.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 45 of 63
2.14.4. Future Perspectives
As little information on Tf Ca is currently available, determining the crystallographic
structure of the enzyme would provide a deeper understanding of its activity at the molec-
ular level. To reach the plastic-degrading industry standard levels, in-site mutagenesis
should be applied for enhancement of thermostability and enzymatic activity.
2.15. Lesser-Known Enzymes
In addition to the 16 enzymes described in detail above, over the years, several other
enzymes have been reported to exhibit some PET degrading ability. These are portrayed in
this section.
2.15.1. Enterobacter sp. HYI Esterase B (EsEstB)
EsEstB, or EstB, is an esterase from Enterobacter sp. HYI isolated and characterized by
Qiu et al. [236] in 2020. The enzyme was shown to be able to degrade BHET to MHET and
TPA. The bacterial strain was isolated from a plastic waste treatment station and identiﬁed
as an esterase after assays conﬁrming esterase-like activity.
Qiu et al. [236] characterized EsEstB as sharing 99.7% sequence similarity with esterase
from Enterobacter hormaechei. However, no BHET or PET degrading activity has been
reported for this enzyme. Sequence-based structure predictions revealed the typical α/β-
hydrolase fold, with a catalytic triad composed of residues Ser110, Asp158, and His190.
Activity assays showed maximum activity was attained at an optimal pH of 8.0 and
temperature of 40 ◦C. EsEstB degraded 80.8% of BHET in 120 h at a degradation rate
of 6.73 mg/L·h to produce MHET and further degrades MHET to TPA. The ability for
complete degradation of BHET, frequently used as the PET commercial model, is promising
for future applications of EsEstB in PET degradation.
2.15.2. HR29 Hydrolase (BhrPETase)
BhrPETase, a hydrolase from thermophilic bacteria HR29, was recently overexpressed
in Bacillus subtilis by Xi et al. [237] and shown to fully degrade PET. HR29 is involved in the
biochemical nitrogen cycle and was identiﬁed by Kato et al. [238] in a long-term cultivation
of thermophiles. Xi et al. [ 237] expressed BhrPETase in B. subtilis and characterized it.
The enzyme shares 94% sequence identity with LCC, differing in 16 amino acid residues
only.
BhrPETase is a 275 amino acid residue enzyme with a conserved α/β-hydrolase fold
and one disulﬁde bridge (Cys275–Cys292). The catalytic triad is made up of residues
Ser165, His242, and Asp210.
Given the advantages of expressing enzymes in B. subtilis due to this bacterium be-
ing non-pathogenic, robust, and highly studied, Xi et al. [237] expressed LCC, IsPETase,
and BhrPETase to compare activity and thermal stability. Enzymatic activity was ﬁrstly
characterized with a series of monoesters of varying lengths, and then speciﬁc PET degrad-
ing activity was measured using BHET and low crystallinity PET powder as substrates.
Depolymerization of PET substrates yielded TPA as the major product, and BHET and
MHET in lower amounts. Similar to other PET degrading enzymes, BhrPETase exhibited
higher activity on shorter acyl-chain length substrates, and maximum activity at a pH of
6 to 8. BhrPETase showed remarkable thermal stability by linearly increasing activity from
30 to 90 ◦C, contrary to LCC that, although highly stable, suffered an activity decrease
above 80 ◦C. Furthermore, BhrPETase Tm reached 110 ◦C, the highest known to PET degrad-
ing enzymes, and increased by 6.4 ◦C in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Comparison with LCC
suggests Glu208, Asp238, and Ser283 as probable calcium binding residues. BhrPETase
proved highly active on PET powder complete degradation to BHET, MHET, and TPA,
with the highest conversion occurring at 70 ◦C.
Although there is no three-dimensional structure available for BhrPETase, the high
similarity with LCC justiﬁed the design of an LCC-based homology model. The differences
found in the sequence might explain the higher thermal stability of BhrPETase regarding
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 46 of 63
LCC. Xi et al. [ 237] proposed that Ser175 and Gln202 (which occupy the positions of
Ala175 and Val202 in LCC) establish hydrogen bonds with nearby residues, replacing
the hydrophobic interactions in LCC. Furthermore, two proline residues in BhrPETase
(Pro199 and Pro248) occupy the positions of a serine and an asparagine in a loop region in
LCC. It has been argued [237] that these proline residues might result in higher rigidity of
the loop contributing to thermal stability of the overall structure.
Overall, BhrPETase is a novel enzyme with high PET degrading activity, thermal
stability, and a Tm higher than the Tg of PET, features that make it a very promising enzyme
for further studies on the biodegradation of PET.
2.15.3. Bacillus subtilis Lipase (BsEstB)
BsEstB, a Bacillus subtilis lipase, was ﬁrstly isolated by Eggert et al. [ 239] in 2000.
This enzyme was demonstrated to have PETase-like activity by Ribitsch et al. [53] in 2011.
BsEstB is an intracellular p-nitrobenzylesterase with a molecular weight of 55.2 kDa and
an isoelectric point of 4.9. It was identiﬁed as belonging to the α/β-hydrolase family,
similar to most PET hydrolytic enzymes, and the catalytic triad is made up of residues
Ser189, His399, and Glu310. The enzyme shares a 99% similarity with typical B. subtilis and
carboxylesterase type B [53].
Activity for PET degradation was ﬁrstly identiﬁed in a large screening of 250 enzymes
with 3PET on agar plates. Subsequently to identiﬁcation, isolation and expression, BsEstB
was submitted to activity assays with PET ﬁlm and BHET [ 53]. The enzyme is able to
degrade PET to completion, as the major products of hydrolysis are TPA and benzoic acid.
MHET was identiﬁed as a minor product and a rapidly degraded intermediate. Maximum
activity was registered at 40◦C and pH 7 [53] The ability to completely depolymerize PET to
its constituent monomers while being an intracellular enzyme is uncommon, and suggests
this lipase is an ideal target for further PET degrading assays and studies.
2.15.4. Streptomyces scabies Sub1 (ScSub1)
ScSub1, commonly known as Sub1, is a cutinase-like enzyme from Streptomyces scabies,
a gram-positive plant pathogen bacterium [240]. The protein was ﬁrst discovered per iden-
tiﬁcation of the gene sub1, which showed speciﬁc expression in the presence of cutin and
suberin [241], and was recently characterized and subjected to speciﬁc activity assays [240].
Sequence similarity to fungal cutinases led to the classiﬁcation of ScSub1 as a cutinase-like
enzyme.
The structure for ScSub1 [240] was predicted using the ESyPred3D [242] server with a
cutinase from Aspergillus oryzae (PDB: 3GBS) as a template. The resulting structure suggests
a canonical α/β-cutinase-like fold, made up of a ﬁve parallel strands central β-sheet
surrounded by ten α-helices. The same prediction suggests the existence of a catalytic triad
composed of Ser114, His195, and Asp182, and two disulﬁde bonds, Cys31–Cys103 and
Cys178–Cys185. The total molecular weight of ScSub1 is estimated to be 25 kDa, which
includes mature ScSub1 with 18.7 kDa and a His-tag of 4.9 kDa.
PET degradation by ScSub1 was assessed by measuring the amount of TPA produced,
at pH 7.5 and 37 ◦C for 20 days. The substrate used was commercially available PET
granules, and TPA production remained constant during the assay time, resulting in a pro-
portional relationship between incubation time and TPA release. Furthermore, the stability
of ScSub1 at 50 ◦C was evaluated, and even though ScSub1 kept active, TPA production
diminished with incubation time, suggesting progressive loss of stability and catalytic
activity.
Interestingly,ScSub1 showed esterase activity by successfully degrading different sub-
strates such as p-nitrophenyl butyrate, p-nitrophenyl octanoate, p-nitrophenyl decanoate,
and p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate. Activity of ScSub1 on cutin and suberin was also con-
ﬁrmed and showed to be stable at room temperature over a 20-day period.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 47 of 63
2.15.5. Pseudomonas mendocina Cutinase (PmCut)
PmCut, aka PmC, is a cutinase from Pseudomonas mendocina ﬁrst described as a PET
degrading enzyme by Kellis et al. [243] in a patent proposition for enzymatic modiﬁcation
of polyesters in 2002. Inspired by this ﬁnding, Ronkvist et al. [ 157] included PmCut in
a comparative study with FsCut and HiCut towards the understanding of the effect of
PET crystallinity percentage on activity. Using two PET samples as substrate, the authors
concluded that PmCut had the highest afﬁnity for low crystallinity PET, having resulted in
5% PET ﬁlm weight loss after 96 h at 50 ◦C. Degradation rate of PmCut was lower than
that of HiCut but higher than FsCut, presumably due to differences in thermal stability and
optimal activity temperature. From the available data, it is to be expected that PmCut has a
high potential as a PET degrading cutinase. However, further biochemical, and structural
studies are essential to conﬁrm enzymatic structure, sequence, and speciﬁc role in PET
degradation.
2.15.6. PET1–PET13
Danso et al. [244] identiﬁed 504 possible PET hydrolytic enzyme candidates through an
automatic search algorithm. Of these, 13 enzymes were selected and named PET1 through
PET13. Activity of PET2, 5, 6, and 12 was veriﬁed through assays on agar plates containing
PET nanoparticles—all four enzymes showed activity.
Furthermore, PET2 and PET6 were subjected to additional activity assays and bio-
chemical characterization. PET2 showed high thermal stability, since it maintained PET
degrading activity up to 90 ◦C, which is highly promising given the amorphous state of
PET polymer at this temperature [244].
The initial search across several databases revealed the most promising candidates,
selected from similarities with experimentally proven PET degrading enzymes, are mainly
from three phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, most se-
quences with high similarity originate from samples containing crude oil, similar to how
ScSub1 was ﬁrst discovered [244].
Database query for novel PET degrading enzymes followed a set of criteria inspired
by enzymes with well characterized activity on PET, namely the presence of a conserved
Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad in the vicinity of an oxyanion hole made up of a Met residue
and an aromatic residue, a terminal disulﬁde bridge essential for enzymatic thermosta-
bility, and a conserved DxDxR(Y)xxF(L)C sequence near the ﬁrst cysteine of the disulﬁde
bridge. Even though no further characterization of these enzymes has been published,
the experimentally validated metagenomic methodology search used and the most promis-
ing enzymes identiﬁed suggest an encouraging path for identifying novel enzymes and
microorganisms with relevant PET degrading activity.
All 13 PET hydrolytic enzymes identiﬁed by Danso et al. [ 244] are described in the
UniProt database—Table 11 summarizes the UniProt access codes and general sequence
characterization for these enzymes. There are no three-dimensional structures available
for these proteins, and therefore speciﬁc structural motifs cannot be characterized and
described with certainty. However, given the privileged knowledge of the amino acid
sequence of each enzyme, several in silico sequence-based structure prediction methods
could be used to combat the lack of an experimentally solved structure and allow for a
deeper understanding of the determined activity rates and thermostability.
From the 13 PET enzymes, PET2, 5, 6, and 12 were tested for PET degrading activity
against agar plates also containing nanoparticles of PCL. PCL was used as a model substrate,
as the hydrolase ability for this substrate correlates with activity on higher complexity
PET substrates. All four enzymes exhibited activity and produced halos in the plates.
Furthermore, PET2 retained 80% of relative activity at 90 ◦C after an incubation period of
5 h with a series of pNP esters, meaning it is even more stable than LCC.
PET2 ability to remain active at higher drastic temperatures makes it an extremely
attractive enzyme for PET degradation. When 100 µg of enzyme were tested with 14 mg
amorphous PET as substrate, 900 µM of TPA were produced after a 24 h period incubation,
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 48 of 63
conﬁrming PET2 demonstrates interesting PET degrading activity and is able to fully
degrade it to TPA.

2.15.7. Thermomonospora curvata Cutinases 0390 and 1278 (TcCut0390 and TcCut1278)
TcCut0390 and TcCut1278, aka Tcur0390 and Tcur1278, are two cutinases fromTher-
momonospora curvata sharing 82% sequence identity [245]. T. curvata is a facultative aerobic
thermophilic bacterium ﬁrst isolated from plant composts [ 246–248]. Bacterial optimal
growth conditions are pH from 7.5 to 11 and a temperature of 50 ◦C, but weak growth has
been registered up to 65 ◦C [245].
Wei et al. [245] isolated and expressed these proteins and characterized their structure
from an homology model. Further molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies
allowed for binding site and structural stability characterization. Both TcCut0390 and
TcCut1278 assume a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold with a catalytic triad composed of
residues Ser130, His207, Asp176. The catalytic residues and the substrate-binding groove
are solvent-exposed and located in the surface of the proteins. TcCut1278 is more thermally
stable than TcCut0390, and they both hydrolyze pNPB and PET nanoparticles. Given the
low thermal stability of both enzymes at temperatures higher than 55◦C, their applicability
in PET degradation campaigns is highly conditioned and dependent on future engineering
efforts to increase enzymatic catalytic turnover and melting temperatures.
The ability of TcCut0390 and TcCut1278 to hydrolase polyurethane (PU) has recently
been characterized by Islam et al. [249] and Schmidt et al. [250].
2.15.8. Thermobiﬁda halotolerans Esterase (ThEst)
ThEst, aka Thh_Est, is an esterase from Thermobiﬁda halotolerans, which was charac-
terized as a PET degrading enzyme by Ribitsh et al. [54]. This 262 amino acid enzyme is
highly similar to TaEst119 and several cutinases from T. cellulosilytica. Sequence analysis
led to the prediction of an α/β-serine hydrolase fold, with residue Ser131 as the catalytic
triad serine, inserted in the typical GxSxG motif. Polyester hydrolysis ability of ThEst
was ﬁrstly tested with 3PET in a 2 h activity assay at 50 ◦C and pH 7.0. Degradation of
3PET resulted in the release of benzoic acid (BA) and 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate (HEB) as
the main products, and MHET and TPA in residual amounts, which suggests an exo-type
hydrolysis mechanism. Consequently, degradation of PET ﬁlm resulted in TPA and MHET
release with no BHET detected, indicating ThEst was able to degrade PET to completion.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 49 of 63
Comparisons with Thermobiﬁda cutinases revealed similar degradation potentials and rates,
differing from the trend of esterases being less efﬁcient PET hydrolases than cutinases.
3. Microorganisms with PET Degradation Activity
The evidence that a given organism can degrade PET or other polyester materials
and use them as a carbon source frequently leads to the identiﬁcation of a PET degrading
enzyme. However, in many cases it is not possible (or it has not yet been done) to identify or
isolate the speciﬁc enzyme responsible for PET depolymerization. In this section, some of
these microorganisms are described.
Liebminger et al. [251] screened for microorganisms with PET degradation activity
by incubating environmental samples with 3PET as the only carbon source for 10 days.
From the active samples, a fungal strain identiﬁed as Penicillium citrinum showed the
best growth. Although an enzyme was puriﬁed, characterization and identiﬁcation of
this presumed polyesterase was not possible. The experiments with PET fabric and 3PET
as substrates revealed optimal conditions for enzymatic activity to be 30 ◦C and pH 8.2.
The enzyme successfully altered the surface of the PET fabric and degraded 3PET to
TPA, MHET, BHET, and BA. Given the described results, it is to be expected that further
biochemical and structural characterization of this novel polyesterase may reveal a new
promising PET degrading enzyme.
Costa et al. [252] showed Yarrowia lipolytica, a widely used yeast, had PET degrading
activity. Y. lipolyticawas cultured with amorphous PET, PET oligomer 3, post-consumer PET
(with high crystallinity), and PET monomers TPA, monoethylene glycol (MEG), and BHET.
Highest activity was registered for the amorphous PET samples, with MHET as the main
product and TPA as a residual released product. This suggests MHET has an inhibitory
effect on the yeast, hindering complete degradation of PET to TPA. Although the yeast was
able to use the monomers as a carbon source in the absence of other substrates, the accumu-
lation of PET degradation products seemed to be toxic for yeast growth, and consumption
rate was higher for PET oligomers than for the monomers. The described results show that
Yarrowia lipolytica is able to express PET degrading enzymes, as evidenced by the release of
MHET in large quantities, and further isolation and expression of these enzymes is of high
importance for future PET degrading yeast studies.
Arguing that using individual puriﬁed enzymes to break down PET might not be the
most promising strategy, Roberts et al. [253] showed that a bacterial consortia containing
Bacillus and Pseudomonas species able to use PET as a sole carbon source resulted in more
effective PET degradation and surface modiﬁcation activity. The consortia were identiﬁed
in a screening of soil samples for lipase activity, and several consortia were built and
further analyzed after initial lipase activity was conﬁrmed. PET hydrolytic activity was
demonstrated by the depolymerization of amorphous PET to BHET, TPA, and EG by the
bacterial consortia. Individual strains identiﬁed within the consortia were tested as well,
but activity and product release were always slower and lower than in the assays with the
full consortia. It was therefore concluded that the bacterial strains in the consortia acted on
PET in a synergistic manner, and complete degradation was only possible in the presence of
all bacterial strains and respective secreted enzymes. Identiﬁcation of individual secreted
enzymes was not possible, which the authors attributed to bioﬁlm formation within the
consortia, and natural tendency of the secreted enzymes to bind the PET sample, hindering
isolation.
4. Potential PET Hydrolases with Activity to Be Conﬁrmed
AoCut, a cutinase from Aspergillus oryzae, has been shown to degrade PCL and the-
orized to have a similar effect on PET [ 254,255]. The two three-dimensional structures
available for AoCut (PDB: 3GBS and 3QPD) reveal an α/β-serine hydrolase fold, with a
central βsheet ﬂanked by αhelixes on either side. The catalytic triad (Ser126, Asp181,
His194) and oxyanion hole (Ser48 and Gln127) are similar to the reported residues in
typical enzymes with PET degrading activity. The two major structural differences that
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 50 of 63
differentiate AoCut are FsCut the additional disulﬁde bridge (Cys63–Cys76, in addition
to the two well conserved Cys37–Cys115 and Cys177–Cys184) and a longer and deeper
groove near the active site. These features could explain the higher thermal stability of
AoCut, and also higher activity on PCL [ 255]. Efforts by Shirke et al. [ 254] to increase
thermal stability via rational mutation design have been successful in increasing T m by
6 ◦C, but with a negative effect on PCL degrading activity. It is widely suggested that
AoCut will have a hydrolytic effect on PET polymer, but only speciﬁc experimental activity
assays can conﬁrm this assumption.
Almeida et al. [256] built a reference data set with 15 highly studied PET degrading
enzymes to scan a 52 genome sequence dataset of the Streptomyces genus. An esterase from
Streptomyces sp., SM14est, was identiﬁed as having the highest potential as PETase-like
enzyme, and was isolated, expressed and subjected to activity assays with PCL. Having
degraded PCL, and given the presence of PETase-like characteristics, it is suggested that
this enzyme is a potential PET hydrolase. A homology model revealed a structure similar
to most PET degrading cutinases, with nine β-sheets and seven α-helixes. The catalytic
triad was identiﬁed as Ser156, Asp202, His234; however, no disulﬁde bridge was predicted
for the enzyme. Comparisons with IsPETase structures revealed a similar binding subsite I,
but different binding subsite II. Molecular docking calculations predicted a binding mode
for BHET like the one observed in IsPETase, supporting the authors’ thesis that SM14est
is likely a PET degrading enzyme. However, besides the obvious need for experimental
conﬁrmation, the absence of any disulﬁde bond is a never-seen feature in PET hydrolases,
and might greatly hinder thermal stability and, consequently, activity.
Huang et al. [257] reported an esterase fromThermobiﬁda fusca named Tf AXE, with high
similarity with Tf HCut and other highly active PET degrading enzymes. Even though
speciﬁc activity against PET or other polyester polymers has not yet been described for
this enzyme, it is consensually regarded as a likely PETase-like enzyme and considered of
major interest in state-of-the-art PET bioremediation studies.
4.1. Thermobiﬁda alba Esterase 119 (TaEst119)
This enzyme is closely related with TaEst1, a conﬁrmed PET hydrolase, and is therefore
a highly promising PET degrading enzyme.
4.1.1. Discovery
TaEst119 is an esterase from Thermobiﬁda alba, a mesophilic bacterium [247]. The strain
AHK119 possesses two tandem genes codifying two highly similar enzymes— TaEst119 and
TaEst1. These enzymes share 95% identity and 98% similarity [45,210].
TaEst119 has a molecular weight of 30 kDa, 300 amino acids, and was ﬁrstly identiﬁed
in 2010 by Hu et al. [258] that described its potential as a PETase-like enzyme, even though
no speciﬁc assays with PET related substrates were reported. However, Thumarat et al. [57]
conﬁrmed TaEst119 activity on agar plates containing the polyesters PCL, PBSA, PBS,
PDLA, PLLA, and PHB. The molecular docking of PET with a TaEst119 three-dimensional
structure was also reported by Thuramat, showing a good ﬁtting of the docked PET unit in
the active site for optimal catalyses.
4.1.2. Structure
In 2012, Thuramat et al. [ 57] predicted the TaEst119 structure from its sequence by
modeling a 3D structure based on the well characterized homologous lipase, S. exfoliatus
M11. The group reported that the enzyme displays an α/β-hydrolase fold with central
nine stranded parallel β-sheets ﬂanked by seven α-helices on both sides. Existent crys-
tallographic structures for TaEst119 are summarized in Table 12. Later in the same year,
the ﬁrst crystallographic structure was reported by Kitadokoro et al. [57] with a resolution
of 1.76 Å. The structure conﬁrmed that this enzyme exists as a monomer and exhibits
an α/β-hydrolase fold with a central twisted β-sheet of nine β-strands, ﬂanked by nine
α-helices on both sides. The catalytic triad, which is located in the loops between the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 51 of 63
β-sheets and helices, is composed of Ser169, His247, and Asp215. The oxyanion hole is
made up of amino acid residues Met170 and Tyr99. However, in a later report by Thumarat
et al. [210], Met166 and Tyr99 are suggested as the residues comprising the oxyanion hole.
A disulﬁde bond (Cys280–Cys298) is displayed in the C-terminal region.

6AID 1.3 Ethyl lactate - 2018 [260]
A crystallographic structure was also developed by Kawai et al. [45] with a resolution
of 1.68 Å. Two Ca2+ binding sites were shown to occupy a position in the loop regions α7–
β9 and β9–C-terminal. Lastly, Kitadokoro et al. [260] determined the structure complexed
with ethyl lactate (EL) with a resolution of 1.3 Å, in 2018. Here, the group conﬁrmed
the existence of the previously reported Ca2+ binding sites, also reporting two other Ca2+
binding sites, amounting to a total of 4 Ca2+ binding sites. Studies on the active site revealed
it is formed by a long narrow groove. The terminal side of the groove is comprised of Tyr99,
Met170, Trp194, and Ile217, which involve lactate (LAC). Tyr99, Ile217, and Phe248 also
form hydrophobic interactions with EL.
4.1.3. Activity
The optimal conditions for TaEst119 activity have been reported to be around 45 to
55 ◦C and pH 6.0, where the enzyme loses 50% of its activity at 60 ◦C [258].
Among the p-nitrophenyl acyl esters, TaEst119 revealed higher enzymatic activity
towards pNPB substrate, resulting in a kcat of 4.48 ± 0.21 s−1 [57], and a speciﬁc activity of
2.30 ± 0.02 U/mg in the absence of Ca2+ and 8.29 ± 0.03 U/mg in the presence of 300 mg
of Ca2+ [210].
The substitution of the N-terminus residues correlated to higher enzymatic activity
towards pNPB [57]. Replacing Ala68 with isoleucine, valine, or leucine results in an
increase in hydrophobicity; however, the opposite is observed when the residue is replaced
by tyrosine, tryptophan, or proline. The variant A68V resulted in the highest activity.
The thermostability was signiﬁcantly increased when Ser219, located in the substrate-
docking loop, was replaced with proline (S219P). The double mutant (A68V/S219) resulted
in a speciﬁc activity of 115 ± 3.5 and 299 ± 10.1 U/mg in the absence and presence of Ca2+,
respectively [210]. In the presence of Ca2+ the enzymatic activity and thermostability were
remarkably enhanced, suggesting that even though the secondary structure is not affected
by Ca2+, the cations stabilize the tertiary protein structure [45,57,210,260].
4.1.4. Proposed Mechanism
No catalytic mechanism towards PET degradation has been reported. However,
Kitadokoro et al. [260] proposed the mechanism for ethyl lactate, which is the analogue of
another plastic polymer, polylactic acid (PLA).
According to their proposal, His247 deprotonates Ser169, which becomes a nucleophile
able to attack the carbonyl carbon atom of EL, resulting in the movement of a pair of
electrons from the double bond of the carbonyl oxygen towards the oxygen, which are
stabilized by the main-chain nitrogen atoms comprising the oxyanion hole (Tyr99 and
Met170). This process results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The covalent
electrons of the ester bond between the oxygen and the carbon in EL attack the hydrogen
of Hys247, breaking the ester bond. The electrons that previously moved from the carbonyl
oxygen double bond restore the double bond, leading to the collapse of the tetrahedral
intermediate, which forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate and ethanol. The same pair
of electrons move again to the oxygen and a water molecule bonds to the carbon atom
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 11257 52 of 63
of the acyl-enzyme. The hydrolytic attack by the water molecule towards the nitrogen
of His247 leads to another intermediate and the release of ethanol. Lastly, the proton
originated from the hydrolytic attack is transferred to Ser169, regenerating the catalytic
triad, and thus releasing lactate.
4.1.5. Future Perspectives
To implement TaEst119 in the plastic-degrading industry for catalyses of PET sub-
strates, enzymatic activity and thermostability need to be enhanced. For a better under-
standing of the enzymatic activity, studies of TaEst119 complexed with PET substrates
should be developed.
5. Summary and Outlook
As awareness increases about how plastics affect human health and the environment,
so do the efforts by the scientiﬁc community in ﬁnding solutions. The evolution of bio-
engineering and bioremediation technology and research has allowed for the progressive
discovery of several enzymes with plastic degradation ability, mainly for PET, as one of the
most produced, used, and discarded plastics.
Although several of these enzymes are highly promising, their activities and thermal
stabilities are still far from the desirable thresholds for efﬁcient and large-scale applicability.
A summary of the best engineering efforts for the described enzymes is presented in
Table 13. Many of the enzymes with highly characterized structures are yet to be the target
of mutagenic studies, and their potential activities remain to be explored. More studies are
required to unharness the full potential of these enzymes for PET degradation.
