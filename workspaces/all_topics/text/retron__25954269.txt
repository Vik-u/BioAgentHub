A major fraction of Earth’s prokaryotic biomass dwells in the deep subsurface, where
cellular abundances per volume of sample are lower, metabolism is slower, and
generation times are longer than those in surface terrestrial and marine environments.
How these conditions impact biotic interactions and evolutionary processes is largely
unknown. Here we employed single cell genomics to analyze cell-to-cell genome content
variability and signatures of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and viral infections in ﬁve
cells of Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, which were collected from a 3 km-deep
fracture water in the 2.9 Ga-old Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa. Between 0 and
32% of genes recovered from single cells were not present in the original, metagenomic
assembly of Desulforudis, which was obtained from a neighboring subsurface fracture.
We found a transposable prophage, a retron, multiple clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and restriction-modiﬁcation systems, and an
unusually high frequency of transposases in the analyzed single cell genomes. This
indicates that recombination, HGT and viral infections are prevalent evolutionary events
in the studied population of microorganisms inhabiting a highly stable deep subsurface
environment.

Introduction
Deep subsurface microorganisms constitute a signiﬁcant fraction of the living biomass on our
planet (Whitman et al., 1998; Kallmeyer et al., 2012), but our knowledge of these microor-
g
anisms remains very limited, due to the diﬃculties in accessing these environments without
introducing microbial contamination and to our inabilities to isolate the indigenous micro-
biota through cultivation ( Colwell and D’Hondt, 2013). Some deep subsurface fracture com-
m
unities have been physically isolated from other habitable environments for up to tens
of millions of years and are characterized by extreme energy limitation. Existing data sug-
gest that deep subsurface microbial communities diﬀer from those of surface environments
Labonté et al. Single cell genomics of Firmicutes
in taxonomic composition, scarce energy sources, and energy
production aﬀected by a complete lack of light (
Stevens and
McKinley, 1995; Lin et al., 2006 ). They often have extremely low
metabolic rates and generation times that span hundreds to th ou-
sands of years ( Phelps et al., 1994; Jørgensen and D’Hondt, 2006;
Lin et al., 2006; Onstott et al., 2014 ).
The deep fracture water of the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa
is a mixture of ancient hydrothermal ﬂuid and meteoric water
(
Lippmann et al., 2003; Onstott et al., 2006; Lippmann-Pipke
et al., 2011 ) that contains abiogenic hydrocarbons and H 2-rich
gasses (Ward et al., 2004; Lollar et al., 2006, 2008, 2014 ) and har-
bors unusual microbial communities and metazoans ( Takai et al.,
2001a,b; Moser et al., 2005b; Borgonie et al., 2011 ). A composite
genome assembly of an indigenous ﬁrmicute Candidatus Desul-
forudis audaxviator MP104C was obtained from metagenomic
reads from fracture water collected from a 2.8 km-deep bore-
hole in the Mponeng gold mine (
Chivian et al., 2008 ). The gene
content of MP104C revealed a chemotactic sulfate-reducing b ac-
terium capable of ﬁxing N 2 and CO2 while utilizing the chemical
products of water radiolysis as its ultimate energy source ( Chi-
vian et al., 2008 ). Some of its key metabolic features, such as
N2 ﬁxation, cobalamin synthesis, and sulﬁte reduction appear
to be products of ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) even ts
from other bacteria and archaea. The presence of multiple tran s-
posases and CRISPRs in the MP104C genome provided evidence
of HGT and interactions with phages. Surprisingly, >99.9% of
the metagenomic reads from the Mponeng sample mapped to
the composite genome assembly, and only 32 positions in the
2.35 Mbp genome contained single nucleotide polymorphisms.
This indicated a unique, one-species ecosystem with one of th e
lowest reported rates of mutation. Ribosomal RNA sequences
that are near-identical to MP104C have been detected in many
subsurface sites outside the Witwatersrand Basin, includi ng in the
Fennoscandian Shield in Finland (
Itävaara et al., 2011 ), a deep
saline geothermal aquifer in Germany ( Lerm et al., 2013 ), and
the Juan de Fuca crustal basalt ﬂuids ( Jungbluth et al., 2013 ).
This suggests that D. audaxviator is highly adapted to condi-
tions of the immense deep subsurface environment and has a
cosmopolitan distribution. However, to the best of our knowl -
edge, 16S rRNA sequences have remained the only type of infor-
mation about Desulforudis from locations outside the Mponeng
fracture, leaving its genetic diversity and associated evo lutionary
and ecological implications largely unknown.
Single cell genomics (SCG) is a novel technology oﬀering
recovery of genomic information from individual, uncultiva ted
cells (
Stepanauskas, 2012 ). SCG provides quantitative informa-
tion of genomic variability in natural microbial communiti es,
allowing for the study of gene exchange among cells and genom e
rearrangements within a cell. Such information is hard to ob tain
using other methods, such as metagenomics, where genome
assemblies are consensuses from a multitude of cells that ar e
assumed to be clonal (
Dupont et al., 2012; Iverson et al., 2012;
Narasingarao et al., 2012 ).
To better understand the evolutionary mechanisms of natu-
ral Desulforudis populations, we performed genomic sequenc-
ing of individual cells collected from a 3.14 km-deep boreho le
in the Tau Tona mine, which is located near the site where Ca.
D. audaxviatorMP104C was obtained. We sequenced ﬁve single
ampliﬁed genomes (SAGs) carrying SSU rRNA gene sequences
with >99.5% identity to MP104C. Our results show that, despite
a highly stable environment and extremely low cell abundance ,
microbial populations still engage in horizontal gene transfe r, a
process usually believed to be a strategy for fast adaptations to
changing environmental conditions.
Materials and Methods
Field Sample Collection
For single cell genomics, water samples were collected from
the borehole DPH5057-TT109-Bh1 in the Tau Tona gold mine,
located in the north margin of the Witwatersrand Basin, near
Carletonville, South Africa, at 3.14 km depth below the sur-
face. This borehole penetrated ∼25 m ahead of a tunnel that
was advancing through the seismically-active, Pretorius Fa ult
Zone (
Heesakkers et al., 2011 ) when it struck fracture water. The
low microbial abundance (8000 cells mL −1), elevated pH (8–9)
and temperature (48–49 ◦C), and high reductive potential (340–
370 mV) in the collected Tau Tona fracture water were typical o f
the deep subsurface of the Kaapvaal Craton ( Magnabosco et al.,
2014); while the 14C content of the DIC suggested a subsurface
residence time of ∼21 kyr (Supplementary Table 1).
An acid-washed, autoclaved stainless steel manifold with m ul-
tiple sampling ports was connected to the valve that had been
installed on the borehole by the mine. Sampling ports had a
valve to adjust water ﬂow rate to meet various sampling requir e-
ments. The port was opened to ﬂush out the water for ∼5 min
before any sampling activities were undertaken. Unﬁltered bor e-
hole water was collected in a 50 mL Falcon tube and transported
to the laboratory on ice. Within 6 h, 1 mL aliquots were trans-
ferred to cryovials containing glyTE cryoprotectant (5% glycer ol
and 1x TE buﬀer pH 8.0, ﬁnal concentrations), mixed gently, and
kept frozen at −80◦C until processing.
Single Cell Sorting, Whole Genome Ampliﬁcation,
Sequencing, and Assembly
Single cell sorting, whole-genome ampliﬁcation, PCR-
ampliﬁcation and sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal
RNA (SSU rRNA) genes, as well as the shotgun sequencing
and de novo assembly of the selected SAGs were performed
at the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center
(scgc.bigelow.org), as described previously (
Stepanauskas and
Sieracki, 2007; Swan et al., 2011; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2 012;
Field et al., 2015 ). PCR-ampliﬁed SSU rRNA gene sequences
(∼800–900 bp) of SAGs were edited using Sequencher v4.7 (Gene
Codes) and compared with previously deposited sequences using
the RDP v10 Classiﬁer (SSU rRNA) (
Wang et al., 2007 ) and
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAS T
(Altschul et al., 1990 ) nucleotide database (nt). Using SINA
(Pruesse et al., 2012 ), the SAG SSU rRNA gene sequences were
aligned with sequences selected with the RDP Seqmatch (SSU
rRNA gene sequences from isolates, ≥1200 bp of good quality)
from the RDP pipeline (
Cole et al., 2014 ). A maximum likelihood
tree of the SAG SSU rRNA gene sequences (100 bootstrap repli-
cates) was constructed using phyML v3.1 (
Guindon et al., 2010 )

with the best model [GTR model with a gamma distribution
(+G), estimated rates of variation among sites and a proportio n
of invariable sites ( +I)], as determined with jModelTest 2
(
Darriba et al., 2012 ). Five SAGs having SSU rRNA genes with
more than 99.5% identity to that of Ca. D. audaxviator were
selected for genomic sequencing.
Comparison of Genomes and Identiﬁcation of
Unique SAG Genes
Average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated using JSpec ies
(
Richter and Rosselló-Móra, 2009 ) with the ANIb parameters.
Comparisons of putative proteins from SAG genes were per-
formed with MUMmer using the promer algorithm (
Delcher
et al., 2002 ). The SAGs were compared to each other and to the
metagenomic assembly Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C (GenBank
accession number NC_010424). Contigs that were similar to t he
MP104C genome but contained gaps were manually inspected
and aligned using the Geneious Aligner (Biomatters, Auckla nd,
New Zealand) with a cost matrix of 70% similarity (5.0/-4.0) to
identify the speciﬁc regions of putative horizontal gene tran s-
fer. Gene annotations from the Integrated Microbial Genomes
(IMG) (
Markowitz et al., 2009, 2012 ) pipeline (http://img.jgi.doe.
gov) were used to identify transferred genes and possible mode s
of horizontal gene transfer (tRNA recombination, transposit ion
and homologous recombination).
Functional Classiﬁcation of Proteins
The predicted genes were translated and used to search agains t
the NCBI non-redundant database (nr). The protein functions
were classiﬁed with the COG analyzer (
Tatusov et al., 2000 ) in
MEGAN5 (Huson et al., 2011 ), where each “gene” was considered
a “read.” Transposases were identiﬁed using the IMG annota-
tions, and classiﬁed with the ACLAME database (
Leplae et al.,
2004).
Metagenomic Fragment Recruitment
Previously published metagenomes from boreholes in Tau Tona
(
Lau et al., 2014; Magnabosco et al., 2014 ), Mponeng ( Chivian
et al., 2008 ), and Masimong ( Lau et al., 2014; Magnabosco et al.,
2014) gold mines were used to look at the geographic distribu-
tion of Desulforudis (Supplementary Table 2). BLAST + v2.2.28
(Camacho et al., 2009 ) was used to recruit metagenome reads to
each SAG assembly using BLASTn with default parameter val-
ues, except for the following: -evalue 0.0001 -soft_masking true
-lcase_masking -xdrop_gap 150. Fragment recruitment resul ts,
along with whole genome comparisons were displayed using
Circos v0.66 (
Krzywinski et al., 2009 ).
Calculation of HGT Rate
Protein sequences from each sequenced SAG were compared
with the NCBI nr database using BLASTp with an e-value cut oﬀ
of 0.001, and the results were searched for “paradoxical” bes t hits,
i.e., best hits to homologs not in Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C,
as in
Koonin (2001) . All automatically detected “paradoxical”
best hits were manually checked to eliminate possible false
positives.
Phylogenetic Analysis of the Virion
Morphogenesis Protein
Analysis of the gene content of the SAGs revealed a trans-
posable phage in SAG AC-310-N13. Sequences similar to the
virion morphogenesis protein of the phage were obtained via
BLASTx against the NCBI non-redundant database (nr). Pro-
tein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (
Edgar, 2004 ), and
the alignment was manually edited in Geneious ( Kearse et al.,
2012). Phylogeny was performed using phyML ( Guindon et al.,
2010) implemented in Geneious with 100 bootstrap replicates
and the LG model with a gamma distribution ( +G), estimated
rates of variation among sites and a proportion of invariable s ites
(+I). Trees were viewed with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac. uk/
software/ﬁgtree/).

Results and Discussion
Generation, Identiﬁcation, and Genomic
Sequencing of Single Ampliﬁed Genomes (SAGs)
Small subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained from 52 of
the 315 (17%) multiple displacement ampliﬁcation reactions con-
taining individual cells. This percentage was slightly lowe r than
19–39% obtained from marine (
Swan et al., 2011 ) and freshwater
(Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012 ) bacterioplankton using the same
techniques. The retrieved SSU rRNA gene sequences revealed
SAGs belonging to Firmicutes (43 SAGs), Nitrospirae (8 SAGs)
and Bacteroidetes (1 SAG) ( Figure 1). The SSU rRNA genes
formed 10 clusters with >99% sequence identity to each other
and to sequences that were previously retrieved from diverse
subsurface environments ( Figure 1). Of the 52 identiﬁed SAGs,
25 contained SSU rRNA genes that were 99.5-100% identical to
that of Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C. This shows that close rel-
atives of Desulforudis inhabit multiple subsurface environments
and can coexist with other microbial species, in support of prior ,
metagenomic evidence (
Moser et al., 2003, 2005a; Lin et al.,
2006).
Of the ﬁve Desulforudis SAGs that were genomically
sequenced, AC-310-E02 and AC-310-O10 had SSU rRNA genes
that were 100% identical to MP104C, while AC-310-A06, AC-
310-N13, and AC-310-P15 had SSU rRNA genes that were 99.5%
identical to MP104C. Between 66 and 129 kbp of DNA sequence
was recovered from each SAG in contigs larger than 2 kbp, corre -
sponding to 4–8% of the expected genome size ( Table 1). This
SAG genome recovery was signiﬁcantly lower ( p < 0.001, t-
test) than the 55% average genome recovery reported in a recen t
single cell genomics study of surface ocean bacterioplankton ,
which employed comparable laboratory and computational pro-
cedures (
Swan et al., 2013 ). The unusually low genome recovery

Only contigs longer than 2000 bp were included in this analysis. The% genome recovery estimate is based on the assumption that genomes of all Desulforudis have the same length

from Desulforudis SAGs may have been caused by multiple fac-
tors, such as incomplete cell lysis; chemical interactions o f DNA
with other molecules that prevented ampliﬁcation; or ineﬃcie nt
multiple displacement ampliﬁcation resulting from the high GC
content (61%) of D. audaxviator. Another plausible explanation
is that the analyzed Desulforudis cells were endospores or other
resting stages that were diﬃcult to lyse. Inside an endospore ,
DNA is protected by small acid-soluble proteins (
Setlow, 1995 )
that may not be denaturated with the alkaline lysis of the cel ls
used in this study. Further support for this hypothesis is pro-
vided by the presence of sporulation genes in Ca. D. audaxviator
MP104C (
Chivian et al., 2008 ) and the unusually dim ﬂuores-
cence of Tau Tona microbial cells with the SYTO-9 nucleic aci d
stain (Supplementary Figure 1), which is typical for hard-walle d
microbial resting stages ( Setlow et al., 2002 ). We are not aware
of studies of microbial sporulation in the Kaapvaal Craton or
other terrestrial subsurface environments. However, abou t half of
the microbial cells within deep marine sediments are reporte d to
be in a dormant state (
Lennon and Jones, 2011; Lomstein et al.,
2012; Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013 ). Some regions of MP104C
appear to be preferentially recovered in SAGs (inner circles in
Figure 2). A possible explanation is that DNA follows a spe-
ciﬁc folding pattern inside cells or endospores, with only som e
genome regions being accessible to MDA. Another plausible
explanation is preferential recovery of low %GC regions in SAGs .
The lower %GC of the SAG assemblies (54–56% GC) relative to
the 61% GC of the MP104C genome is consistent with the latter
hypothesis.
Genome Content Variation among Desulforudis
Cells
The average nucleotide identity (ANI) among the ﬁve sequenc ed
SAGs and the MP104C genome ranged between 88.5 and 99.9%
(Supplementary Table 3). This demonstrates a signiﬁcant dive r-
gence of homologous genome regions among the analyzed Desul-
forudis cells, despite their 16S rRNA genes being ≥99.5% identical
to each other. Interestingly, 10 SAG contigs (out of a total o f 62)
had no homology to MP104C (Supplementary Table 4). Another
22 SAG contigs contained both conserved and novel genome
regions, when compared to MP104C (showcased as links in
Figure 2, and Supplementary Figure 2). The signiﬁcant recruit-
ment of metagenomic fragments from Tau Tona but not Mpo-
neng and Masimong by some of the SAG-speciﬁc genome regions
demonstrated their geographic endemism (asterisks in Figure 2
and Supplementary Table 5).
Between 0 and 32% of genes found in the sequenced
SAGs were absent in the Ca. D. audaxviatorMP104C genome
(Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that they are products of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In other taxa of Firmicutes ,
such as Bacillus subtilis and B. halodurans, the percentage of
newly acquired genes has been estimated to ∼9%, while rates of
up to 20% have been observed in Spirochaetes (
Koonin, 2001 ).
The majority of SAG genes (80%) with no homology to Ca.
D. audaxviator MP104C were similar to genes found in other
Firmicutes, such as Desulfotomaculum sp. and Pelotomaculum
sp. (Figure 3). Interestingly, many of these novel regions were in
close proximity to transposases (9 cases), tRNA (2 cases), reco m-
binases (2 cases), CRISPRs (1 case), and a prophage (1 case), all
of which are indicative of recombination and HGT (
Ochman
et al., 2000; Gogarten et al., 2002; Brüssow et al., 2004; Mar raf-
ﬁni and Sontheimer, 2010 ) (Supplementary Figure 2, and Sup-
plementary Table 7). These results indicate a high prevalence of
HGT events among autochthonous bacterial populations of the
deep subsurface, despite their extremely slow metabolism and
generation times that can be hundreds to thousands of years
(
Phelps et al., 1994; Jørgensen and D’Hondt, 2006; Lin et al.,
2006).
The recovered regions of the ﬁve sequenced SAGs encoded
for 20 transposases, representing 3.6% of all genes (Supplemen-
tary Table 8). The MP104C genome encodes 35 transposases,
accounting for only 1.5% of all genes, which is still above the
0.83% average found in all sequenced microbial genomes and
metagenomes (
Aziz et al., 2010 ). This suggests that transposi-
tion may be signiﬁcant in the evolution of Desulforudis natural
populations. Transposases are among the most abundant genes
in nature (
Aziz et al., 2010 ) and are best known for their role in
the HGT of antibiotic resistance genes ( Scott, 2002; Whittle et al.,
2002) and the relocation of regulatory elements ( Shapiro, 2010 ).
The only other study of transposase genes in a subsurface envi -
ronment that we are aware of, in the Lost City deep hydrother-
mal system, also found an unusually high abundance of these
genes, with more than 8% of metagenomic shotgun reads hav-
ing a signiﬁcant similarity to transposases (
Brazelton and Baross,
2009).
To identify the genes that may have been acquired by trans-
position, we looked at neighborhoods of transposases on the
SAG contigs and classiﬁed them based on their COG func-
tion (Supplementary Table 9). Most of the genes (57%) were
not assigned or had no hits to the database. Intriguingly, mo st
identiﬁed genes were involved in signal transduction (30%

or the identiﬁed genes) and transcription/transcription reg u-
lation (11%) ( Figure 4; Supplementary Table 9). This suggests
that transposition in Desulforudis populations may be primar-
ily involved in the evolution of regulation and communicati on
rather than new metabolic capabilities.
The apparent prevalence of HGT in an environment with
extremely low cell abundance and slow growth is puzzling. A
plausible explanation may be provided by the possibility that
bioﬁlm-associated rather than free-living cells dominate sub-
surface microbiome (
Taylor and Wirsen, 1999; Cozzarelli et al.,
2007). Densely populated bioﬁlms may provide microenviron-
ments that enhance horizontal gene transfer ( Molin and Tolker-
Nielsen, 2003 ) and may serve as a source of cells and spores to
the fracture water that was analyzed in this study. Further s tudies
are required to determine the presence and role of bioﬁlms in t he
Witwatersrand Basin.
Signatures of Desulforudis Interactions with
Phages and Mobile Genetic Elements
Two contigs in AC-310-N13 (NODE_2 and NODE_13)
contain phage-like sequences with no homology to MP104C
(Supplementary Table 4). The presence of genes encoding a
virion morphogenesis protein, a major capsid protein, and a
terminase protein that are distantly related to Mu-like phages,
and the co-occurrence of bacteria- and phage-like genes on
NODE_2 indicate a Mu-like transposable prophage ( Figure 5).
Transposable phages are believed to be temperate phages. They
reproduce by transposition as part of their infectious cycle,

in this way facilitating HGT and impacting the evolution of
their hosts (
Wang et al., 2004 ). Very few transposable phages
have been isolated and sequenced to date. However, a recent
re-analysis of genomic databases has revealed Mu-like prophag es
within the genomes of several Firmicutes and Proteobacteri a
(
Toussaint, 2013 ). The virion morphogenesis protein in AC-
310-N13 is distantly related to prophages in other subsurface
bacteria and non-subsurface Firmicutes, indicating co-ev olution
of these phages and their hosts (Supplementary Figure 3).
The low nutrient concentrations observed in the deep subsur -
face are expected to be unfavorable for lytic phage infections
(
Fuhrman, 1999 ). Therefore, lysogeny may be the preferred
lifestyle for deep subsurface phages. At least one prior study
has indicated the prevalence of lysogeny in deep hydrotherma l
vents (
Williamson et al., 2008 ). A selective advantage of lyso-
genic phage-host systems may be the immunity induced by
them against other phages (
Canchaya et al., 2003 ). Prophages
sometimes increase the ﬁtness of their host through lysogen ic
conversion or the transfer of useful genetic information ( Brüs-
sow et al., 2004 ). To the best of our knowledge, our study is
the ﬁrst to demonstrate the presence of transposable phages
in the deep subsurface and their interactions with indigeno us
microorganisms.
We detected a CRISPR and associated cas genes in AC-
310-E02 (Supplementary Figure 4). The same loci were also
present in the MP104C genome, with some diﬀerences in the
CRISPR spacers. Three additional CRISPR loci were also present
in MP104C. However, none of the identiﬁed CRISPR spac-
ers were homologous to the Mu-like viral sequences in AC-
310-N13. Furthermore, genes encoding a type III restriction -
modiﬁcation system and a restriction endonuclease were fou nd

in AC-310-E02, while a type I restriction modiﬁcation pro-
tein was found in AC-310-N13. The presence of these phage
defense mechanisms provides further evidence for the impor-
tance of phage-host interactions in the ultra-deep fracture s of
the Kaapvaal Craton. While several prior studies report micro-
scopic observations of viral particles in terrestrial subsur face

(Kyle et al., 2008 ), the prevalence of lysogeny in hydrothermal
systems ( Williamson et al., 2008; Engelhardt et al., 2013 ), and
the presence of prophage-like sequences in subsurface culture d
isolates ( Coombs, 2009 ), our study may be the ﬁrst to identify
transposable phage interactions with their hosts in indigeno us,
predominant microorganisms of the deep terrestrial subsurf ace.
Remarkably, one of the SAG contigs with no homology to
MP104C, AC-310-P15 NODE_5, carries a gene for a retron-type
RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Retrons are small genetic ele-
ments that encode for a reverse transcriptase (RT) similar to
the RT found in retroviruses and other retroelements. Retron s
remain poorly characterized, but are found in many bacterial
genomes and could play a role in the evolution and ﬁtness of the ir
host (
Lampson et al., 2005; Simon and Zimmerly, 2008 ). To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst record of retrons in de ep
subsurface environments.
Conclusions
Our study conﬁrms that close relatives ( >99.5% identity of
the 16S rRNA gene) of the ﬁrmicute Candidatus Desulforudis
audaxviator inhabit multiple deep subsurface fractures of the
Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa. Unexpectedly, we found that
D. audaxviator coexists with other bacterial species and under-
goes frequent horizontal gene transfer and viral infection s.
Our ﬁndings of a prophage, a retron, multiple CRISPRs and
restriction-modiﬁcation systems, and an unusually high fre -
quency of transposases suggest that recombination, HGT and
viral infections may play a role in the evolution of indigenou s
microorganisms in the deep subsurface, despite their extrem ely
low cell abundance, slow metabolism and long generation times .
