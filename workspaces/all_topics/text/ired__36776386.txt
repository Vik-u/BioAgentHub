ABSTRACT: Imine reductases (IREDs) catalyze the asymmetric
reduction of cyclic imines, but also in some cases the coupling of
ketones and amines to form secondary amine products in an enzyme-
catalyzed reductive amination (RedAm) reaction. Enzymatic RedAm
reactions have typically used small hydrophobic amines, but many
interesting pharmaceutical targets require that larger amines be used in
these coupling reactions. Following the identification of IR77 from
Ensifer adhaerens as a promising biocatalyst for the reductive amination
of cyclohexanone with pyrrolidine, we have characterized the ability of
this enzyme to catalyze couplings with larger bicyclic amines such as
isoindoline and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole. By comparing the
activity of IR77 with reductions using sodium cyanoborohydride in
water, it was shown that, while the coupling of cyclohexanone and
pyrrolidine involved at least some element of reductive amination, the amination with the larger amines likely occurred ex situ, with
the imine recruited from solution for enzyme reduction. The structure of IR77 was determined, and using this as a basis, structure-
guided mutagenesis, coupled with point mutations selecting improving amino acid sites suggested by other groups, permitted the
identification of a mutant A208N with improved activity for amine product formation. Improvements in conversion were attributed
to greater enzyme stability as revealed by X-ray crystallography and nano differential scanning fluorimetry. The mutant IR77-A208N
was applied to the preparative scale amination of cyclohexanone at 50 mM concentration, with 1.2 equiv of three larger amines, in
isolated yields of up to 93%.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the emergence of imine reductases (IREDs)
has had a substantial impact on the application of enzymes in
the preparation of chiral amines of pharmaceutical interest.
1−5
IREDs are NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases that catalyze
the asymmetric reduction of prochiral imines, but in certain
cases also enable the reductive amination of prochiral ketones
through catalysis of both imine formation and subsequent
reduction of the iminium ion intermediate. In such cases where
evidence has been provided of the enzyme catalyzing both
chemical steps at near or equimolar ratios of ketone and amine
substrates, this subset of IREDs have also been termed
“reductive aminases” (RedAms) (Scheme 1).
6−12
The fundamental nature of the reductive amination reaction
to the formation of amines has ensured that IRED-based
technology has now been applied in the pharmaceutical sector
at up to kg
13
and ton
14
scale. Their ease of expression and
application, in a mode similar to well-studied keto-
reductases,
15
has also ensured that IREDs and RedAms have
been successfully applied in cascades of up to three enzymes in
the synthesis of chiral amines.

In the first descriptions of
IREDs catalyzing reductive aminations at low amine
equivalents,

the amine moiety was in most cases small and
hydrophobic, including, for example, methylamine, allylamine,
and cyclopropylamine. This meant that while “reductive

amination” reactions could certainly be achieved using IREDs
with large excesses of amine to favor imine formation in
solution, true enzyme-catalyzed reductive aminations at
ketone: amine equivalents at or close to 1:1 could for the
most part only be achieved with this limited range of amine
partners. As part of these initial reports, however, and in
publications since, large screens of IREDs from a range of
organism sources, including metagenomes,
5
have revealed
enzymes competent for catalyzing reductive amination
reactions between selected ketones and larger amine partners,
including aniline,
17,18
benzylamine,
17,18
and longer aryl alkyl-
amines.
12
For example, France and co-workers showed that
IRED “IR77” catalyzed the amination of cyclohexanone 1 with
benzylamine a and pyrrolidine b, provided at 2.5 molar equiv
(m.e.), to give the amine products 1a and 1b in up to 78 and
97% conversion, respectively (Scheme 2).
17
More recently,
Gao and co-workers showed that engineered mutants of IR-
G36 enabled the amination of N-Boc-3-piperidinone 2 with 1.1
equiv of amines such as 2-phenylethylamine c to give products
such as 2c with 98% conversion and >99% e.e.
12
Researchers at GSK also showed that aldehyde 3 could be
coupled with amine d at 2.4 m.e. using the “M3” variant of
“IR46” from Saccharothrix espanaensis to give the amine
product 3d in 84.4% yield.
13
Following the earlier work of our
groups,
17
we were interested to explore the limits of acceptance
of bulky amines in the amination of cyclohexanone by “IR77”.
In addition to more standard amine partners such as ammonia
g, methylamine e and allylamine d (Scheme 3), we were
particularly interested in the use of bulky secondary amines
such as isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i, as
when coupled with cyclohexanone 1, the products feature
scaffolds encountered in pharmaceutical molecules such as the
sulfonamide diuretic clorexolone 4 (Scheme 3).
To this end, in this study, we have investigated the ability of
IR77 to enable the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with
bulkier monocyclic and bicyclic imine substrates. A compar-
ison of IR77-catalyzed transformations with abiotic reductive

aminations in which the ketone and amine partners were
incubated with sodium cyanoborohydride suggests that, while
imine formation between either pyrrolidine or benzylamine
with cyclohexanone is likely catalyzed by IR77, reactions with
the larger amines are probably a result of the recruitment of
imine from solution, followed by reduction. The structure of
IR77 was determined, and rational mutagenesis was used to
create mutants of improved activity. These have been
characterized using kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and nano-
differential scanning fluorimetry (nano-DSF), and alanine 208
was identified as a hotspot for improved activity, with mutants
A208S and A208N displaying greater catalytic efficiency than
the wild-type enzyme.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Reductive Aminations Using Purified IR77. The
enzyme designated IR77 by France and co-workers in a
previous work
17
has 100% sequence identity (Figure S1) with
NCBI accession sequence WP_053252429, annotated as an
“NADP-binding domain” from the nitrogen-fixing bacterium
Ensifer adhaerens, also known as a species of Sinorhizobium.
IR77 had previously been shown to be a promising target for
reductive amination reactions, giving 78 and 97% yields for the
coupling of cyclohexanone 1 with benzylamine a and
pyrrolidine b, respectively, when using cell-free extracts
containing the expressed enzyme.
17
As a first step in
investigating the engineering of IR77, the gene was subcloned
into the pET-YSBLIC-3C vector,
19
equipping the protein with
an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and was then expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatog-
raphy followed by size exclusion (Figure S2). The purified
enzyme was assayed for activity by gas chromatography
analysis in small-scale (3 mL) biotransformations containing
10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25 mM amines benzylamine a,
pyrrolidine b, allylamine d, methylamine e, aniline f, or 2 M
ammonia g (Scheme 3 and Figure 1). In each case, the
conversions were superior to those observed with the cell
extracts performed previously,
17
presumably attributable to the
higher specific activity of the purified enzyme employed in
these reactions. After 6 h, near quantitative conversions to
secondary amine products were achieved for reactions with
benzylamine a and pyrrolidine b and methylamine e, although
poor conversion (<10%) was observed with ammonia g, in
agreement with previous observations.
17
Kinetic analysis on wt-IR77 was performed using UV
spectrophotometry to monitor the oxidation of NADPH at
increasing concentrations of cyclohexanone 1or pyrrolidine b
in the presence of a constant concentration of the other
(Tables 1, S3, S4 and Figure S5A,B).
A k
cat
of 0.24 s
−1
for cyclohexanone 1, measured in the
presence of pyrrolidine b, was between those recorded for the
fungal reductive aminases, for example, AspRedAm and
AtRedAm, for which values of 1.47 and 0.11 s
−1
were
previously recorded for the same substrate.
7,8
The K
m
was 15
mM, significantly higher than values recorded for AspRedAm
and AtRedAm of 1.9 and 2.1 mM, respectively.
7,8
For
pyrrolidine b, the k
cat
and K
m
recorded in the presence of 10
mM cyclohexanone were 0.12 s
−1
and 17 mM. These values
were higher and lower, respectively, than those obtained for
this amine with AspRedAm (0.08 s
−1
and 25.1 mM), giving an
approximately two-fold improved catalytic efficiency for IR77
over that enzyme for this transformation.
7
IR77 was also assessed for its ability to catalyze the reductive
amination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 2.5 m.e. of target
amines isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i. In
these reactions (Figure 1), once again, we observed
quantitative conversion to secondary amine products within
2 and 8 h, respectively. Interestingly, kinetics experiments
using increasing concentrations of isoindoline h and 10 mM
cyclohexanone revealed a higher k
cat
of 0.30 s
−1
and a lower K
m
of 0.61 mM for the bulkier amine (Figure S5C and Table S5),
giving a catalytic efficiency of 0.49 s
−1
mM
−1
, 66-fold higher
than for pyrrolidine.
We hypothesized that, rather than this being due to
exceptional improvements in binding of h to the enzyme for
reductive amination, it was reflective rather of a greater amount
of intermediate imine that is formed in solution and recruited
for reduction by the enzyme directly. This would correspond
to a switch in catalytic mode from a reductive aminase in
which both imine formation and imine reduction are catalyzed
by the enzyme, to an IRED, where the imine is formed in
solution and recruited for reduction by the enzyme’s active
site.
To examine this further, evidence for levels of imine
formation in solution was sought by studying mixtures
containing 1 and either b or h in the absence of enzyme by
13
C NMR (Figure 2).
In the mixture of cyclohexanone 1 with isoindoline h,
significant broadening of the ketone carbonyl peak at
approximately 220.5 ppm was observed with a width of
approximately 40 Hz, much wider than all other peaks in
spectrum with approximate values of 3 Hz (Figure 2). This
suggests that an intermediate is formed in solution during this
reaction. However, the lack of peak broadening in the reaction
of 1 with b, with a much narrower peak width of approximately
4 Hz, suggests that no such intermediate is formed in that case.
Although the intermediate suggested by analysis of the reaction
between 1 and h cannot be characterized by variable
temperature experiments due to its short lifetime, its presence
suggests that a significant amount of cyclohexanone reacts to
form an intermediate in solution in the absence of enzyme.
We had previously compared the reactions catalyzed by
RedAms and IREDs with the reductive amination reaction of
sodium cyanoborohydride when challenged with a mixture of
ketone and amine.
8
In those experiments, we showed that both

AdRedAm and AtRedAm catalyzed the formation of N-
allylcyclohexylamine from 1 and d much faster than either
NaBH

CN or an IRED under the same conditions, indicative
of a reductive amination mode of action by AdRedAm and
AtRedAm. A similar approach was employed here: we
incubated NaBH
3
CN, with 1 and either a, b, f, or h, and
compared reactions rates with those incubated with wt-IR77
(Figure 3).
The reaction of 1 with isoindoline h and NaBH
3
CN
displayed similar rates and conversions to that observed with
wt-IR77. The results suggest that the relevant imine is formed
ex situ and only the imine reduction is catalyzed by IR77.

Conversely, reactions with 1 and amines a, b, and f displayed
lower rates and conversions with NaBH
3
CN than with wt-
IR77, suggesting that both the imine formation and its
reduction are catalyzed by IR77 in this case, by a reductive
aminase mode. The results suggest that the mode of catalysis
of IR77 is therefore dependent on the nature of the amine
partner in the reductive amination reaction, including size and
its nucleophilicity in water,
20
which may have a significant
influence on the amount of imine formed in solution.
Structure of IR77. As a first step to making mutants of
IR77 with improved activity toward 1 with b and h, the
structure of the enzyme was determined by X-ray crystallog-
raphy and refined to a resolution of 2.58 Å (PDB code 8A3X).
Data collection and refinement statistics can be found in Table
S6. Crystals were obtained in the P2
1
space group and featured
four molecules, representing two dimers, in the asymmetric
unit. The enzyme adopts the canonical fold now well
established for IRED structures.
7,21−23
An N-terminal
Rossmann domain (residues 1−164) connects to a C-terminal
helical domain (195−294) through a long alpha-helix (165−
194). Two monomers closely associate in a domain swapping
arrangement that serves to form two active sites per dimer,
each at the interface of one N-terminal domain with the C-
terminal domain of its partner (Figure 4A).
A comparison of the monomer with structures in the PDB
using the DALI server
24
revealed closest structural similarity
with the IREDs from Myxococcus stipitatus (6TOE; 51%
sequence identity; rmsd 1.3 Å over 291 Cα atoms)
25
and
Streptosporangum roseum (5OCM; 34%; 1.8 Å over 290).
26
Following building of the protein atoms and water molecules,
clear electron density was observed within each active site that
could in each case be modeled as NADP
+
. When multiple
dimers have been obtained within the asymmetric unit of
IREDs, it has proved possible to discern different conforma-
tions within the same structure, representative of “open” and
“closed” dimers that hint at the structural flexibility of the
IRED during catalysis.
8
In IR77, each dimer can be considered
to be a “closed” structure, with a hydrophobic pocket formed
at the cofactor binding site. The substrate binding site is
defined by the frequently observed aspartate residue D171,
which protrudes from the roof of the cavity into the active site
from the interdomain helix (Figure 4B). Facing the
nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, on the opposite side of the
active site, are the side chains of M178, W179, and H242 from
the partner monomer. At the back of the active site are V212
and L216 from the partner monomer and T123. Two features
of the active site which could explain the activity of the wild-
type IR77 with bulkier imines are the presence of T209 and
P241 at the back and front of the binding site as viewed in
Figure 4B, which replace much larger tryptophan and
methionine residues in IREDs that lack the ability to react
with bulkier substrates, such as AspRedAm,
7
and wild-type IR-
G36.
12
(Figure S7). The product 2-cyclohexylisoindoline 1h
was modeled into the active site of IR77 using Autodock Vina
(Figure 4B). Superimposition of the model with structures of
AspRedAm clearly showed clashes with W210 and M239 in
that enzyme with the cyclohexyl and aromatic rings of the
substrate.
Mutation of IR77. In an effort to identify mutational sites
that might improve the activity of IR77, the choice of first-
round mutations was informed by previous successful
engineering studies on IREDs that had improved activity. In
one notable example, researchers at GSK had successfully
engineered the IRED “IR46” from S. espanaensis for the
reductive amination of 3 with d (Scheme 2) using point site-
saturation mutagenesis and shown that some mutations, with
possible generic implications, which were more remote from
the substrate binding site, were useful for improving the
activity of the IRED for that process.
13
These included Y142S
(IR77 A119), thought to introduce a hydrogen bond to the
pendant D194 (IR77 D171); L201F and V215I (IR77 M178
and C192), each thought to introduce favorable hydrophobic
interactions at the dimer interface; L37Q and V92K (IR77

R12Q and S67K), thought to be involved in cofactor binding
or orientation and S258N, thought to have a role in interaction
with the substrate (IR77 S237). In addition, the previous paper
also identified mutation Q231F, which was thought to again
introduce favorable hydrophobic interactions at the dimer.
Superimposition of a structural model of IR46 suggested that
IR77 has alanine A208 in this position. Hence, we also mutated
A208 to serine to create hydrogen-bonding interactions in a
hydrophilic pocket containing T133, N156, and Q158 in the
partner monomer. Based upon this analysis, IR77 point
mutants R12Q, S67K, A119S, M178F, C192I, S237N, and
A208S, illustrated on the IR77 dimer shown in Figure 4A, were
chosen as starting points for a rational mutagenesis
investigation targeting an improved enzyme for the amination
of 1 with b, h, and i.
Point mutants were prepared by InFusion- (Takara Bio)-
based mutagenesis starting with PCR using primers listed in
Table S2. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and IR77
muteins prepared and purified as for the wild-type (wt)
enzyme. In the first instance, the performance of mutants in
the reductive amination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25
mM pyrrolidine b was assessed using GC analysis (Figure 5A).
These studies revealed that three of the mutants, A119S,
C192I, and A208S, clearly catalyzed the reaction at a rate faster
than the wt, reaching superior conversions of 74, 83, and 79%
compared to the wt (69%) after 4 h. By contrast, active site
mutant S237N was the slowest and resulted in the lowest
conversion after the same time. M178F, S67K, and R12Q also
displayed inferior activity to the wt. In an effort to characterize
the basis for the improved activity, A119S, C192I, and A208S
were subjected to kinetic analysis using cyclohexanone 1 as the
substrate at an invariant concentration of pyrrolidine b (Table
1). While the catalytic efficiency (k
cat

m
) of the A119S and
C92I mutants was the same or only marginally higher
compared to wt-IR77, that of A208S was 2.85-fold and 2.95-
fold increased over the wt for cyclohexanone 1 and pyrrolidine

and to a

in both cases.
Mutants were also assayed with respect to the reductive
amination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25 mM target
amines isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i. For
amine i, A119S, C192I, and A208S single mutants out-
performed wt-IR77 with respect to conversion reaching higher
conversions of 62, 69, and 64% within 6 h with
octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i compared to 56% for wt-
IR77 (Figure 5B). Isoindoline h proved to be an exceptional
amine partner with both the wt-IR77 and best mutants
reaching product conversions of >99% within 2 h (Figure
S6B). Indeed, at this concentration of h, it was not possible to
discriminate between the activities of variants for this amine
substrate.
The superior performance of the three point mutants
identified in the first round prompted us to create a further
library of double (A119S/A208S, A119S/C192I, and C192I/
A208S) and triple (A119S/C192I/A208S) mutants that
combined the beneficial mutations. Interestingly, the combi-
nation of mutations was, for most muteins, largely not additive;
indeed, the catalytic performance of most in the reductive
amination of cyclohexanone 1 with pyrrolidine b was inferior
to that of wt-IR77 or single-point mutants (Figure S6). The
triple mutant A119S/C192I/A208S was the poorest of the
combined mutants overall. However, in the case of A119S/
A208S, conversion after 1 h was slightly improved from 36%
(wt) to 41% (A119S) and 45% (A208S) to 52% (Figure S6D),
although kinetic analysis showed that the catalytic efficiency of
this double mutant was inferior to that of wt-IR77, with a k

.
Given the lack of improved activity in the combined
mutants, the site of mutation with the best catalytic efficiency,
A208S, was further examined using a site saturation muta-
genesis (SSM) library. Preliminary 30 min reactions with 1 and
b or h with all 19 point mutants filtered out those with the
lowest conversions, highlighting seven with conversions greater
than the wt-IR77 for further testing: A208N, A208D A208C,
A208H, A208F, A208K, and A208Y (Figure 6A). Reactions
with 80 mM 1 and 1.2 m.e. h permitted the identification of
four mutants (A208N, A208H, A208K, and A208F) with
superior conversion over 24 h compared to A208S. In order to
discriminate the performance of these mutants, substrate
loadings were increased to 150 mM cyclohexanone and 1.2
m.e. isoindoline. Although conversions plateaued after around
4 h due to the high substrate loadings, the best performance
was observed with A208N, reaching 30% conversion compared
to 22, 15, and 16% for A208H, A208K, and A208F,
respectively (Figure 6B).
The catalytic efficiency of A208N was evaluated with kinetic
measurements (Table 1 and Figure S5). A k
cat
of 0.50 s
−1
for
cyclohexanone 1, measured in the presence of pyrrolidine b,
was greater than that recorded for wt-IR77 (0.25 s
−1
) and
A208S (0.44 s
−1
) (Figure S5A). However, the K
m
of 26 mM
was greater than those recorded for wt-IR77 (16 mM) and
A208S (9.6 mM), leading to a catalytic efficiency only 1.24 fold
greater than the wild type and approximately half that of
A208S. For isoindoline h, the k
cat
recorded in the presence of
10 mM cyclohexanone was 0.28 s
−1
, in between those recorded
for wt-IR77 and A208S of 0.30 and 0.23 s
−1
, respectively
(Figure S5C). However, the K
m
of 0.94 mM was greater than
those recorded for wt-IR77 and A208S of 0.61 and 0.60 mM,
giving 60% of the catalytic efficiency of wt-IR77 in this case.
The lower catalytic efficiency of A208N over A208S is
compensated for by the greater stability observed by the
former. An increase in melting temperature (T
m
), measured
using nano-DSF, of 8.2 °C was observed upon binding of
cofactor, over 2 °C greater than the difference observed with
wt-IR77 and 1 °C greater than A208S (Figure S8). This
improvement in stability is illustrated in the capability of IR77
A208N to withstand significantly greater substrate loadings
than either wt-IR77 or A208S.
Structure of IR77 A208N. To shed light on molecular

featured one more open active site and the other more closed,
and more resembling the conformation observed with those in
the wild-type structure. Following building and refinement of
the structure, electron density for the cofactor NADP
+
was
again clearly visible within the active sites at each dimer
interface. Position A208N is observed at the interface of the C-
terminal helical domain of one monomer and the N-terminal
domain of its partner. Introduction of the mutation has
resulted in new H-bonding interactions between the N208 side
chain and those of T133 and N156 in the partner monomer
(Figure 7). Interestingly, Asn is also found in this position in
the IRED from Actinoalloteichus hymeniacidonis reported by
Gao and co-workers (PDB 7WNN),

although in that
instance, there are no H-bonding side chains on the partner
monomer to form stabilizing interactions. However, the benefit
of engineering intersubunit interactions in IREDs for improved
stability and activity previously described
12,13
is consolidated
by the structural data on IR77-A208N in conjunction with the
biotransformation experiments.
Preparative Reductive Aminations by IR77-A208N.
To assess the applicability of these reactions with the best
mutein, IR77 A208N, preparative scale reactions were
performed on approximately 100 mg scale in 20 mL buffer
with substrate loadings of 50 mM cyclohexanone and 1.2 m.e.
of benzylamine a, pyrrolidine b, and isoindoline h. Substrate
loadings were selected to maintain a balance between high
loadings and high product formation. Products were isolated
with good yields of 71, 62, and 93%, respectively, after flash
column purification, highlighting the potential synthetic
capability of IR77 A208N at higher concentrations of substrate.
■
CONCLUSION
In summary, we report the application of a wild-type IRED for
the reductive amination of ketones with bulky amines. IR77 is
an enzyme capable of tolerating high substrate loadings of up
to 150 mM and low ketone: amine equivalents of 1:1.2 with
cyclohexanone and isoindoline. We have provided further
evidence that bulky amines can be used as amine donors in
reductive amination reactions to give products with high yields,
but that some larger amines, with greater nucleophilicity in
water, may be processed in a different catalytic mode to that of
smaller amines, with ex situ imine formation and subsequent
enzyme-catalyzed reduction predominating in these cases. We
have also shown that mutations that target improved IRED
performance through the formation of new intermolecular
interactions can lead to mutants of superior process stability,
an approach that may be transferred to other IRED
engineering studies in the future.
