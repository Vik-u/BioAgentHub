Abstract
Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been the subject of extensive previous research that can be
grouped into two categories, viz. enzymatic surface modification of polyester fibers and management of PET waste by enzymatic
hydrolysis. Different enzymes with rather specific properties are required for these two processes. Enzymatic surface modifica-
tion is possible with several hydrolases, such as lipases, carboxylesterases, cutinases, and proteases. These enzymes should be
designated as PET surface–modifying enzymes and should not degrade the building blocks of PET but should hydrolyze the
surface polymer chain so that the intensity of PET is not weakened. Conversely, management of PET waste requires substantial
degradation of the building blocks of PET; therefore, only a limited number of cutinases have been recognized as PET hydrolases
since the first PET hydrolase was discovered by Müller et al. ( Macromol Rapid Commun 26:1400–1405, 2005). Here, we
introduce current knowledge on enzymatic degradation of PET with a focus on the key class of enzymes, PET hydrolases,
pertaining to the definition of enzymatic requirements for PET hydrolysis, structural analyses of PET hydrolases, and the reaction
mechanisms. This review gives a deep insight into the structural basis and dynamics of PET hydrolases based on the recent
progress in X-ray crystallography. Based on the knowledge accumulated to date, we discuss the potential for PET hydrolysis
applications, such as in designing waste stream management.

Introduction
Since the 1990s, research on the biodegradation of synthetic
polymers has been promoted extensively owing to the univer-
sal concern about the global environmental crisis. Accordingly,
production of biodegradable polymers has been gradually in-
creasing, but it still comprises a low percentage of total plastic
production. However, a paradigm shift from oil-based produc-
tion to bio-based production has increased the interest in bio-
based production of existing monomers that are currently pro-
duced from oil. However, plastic usage and the resultant plastic
disposal have been increasing consistently with the increase in
world population and in gross national product in developing
countries. Although efforts have been made in many countries
to replace oil-based plastics with biodegradable/bio-based
plastics and to promote recycling of used plastics, the majority
of plastic waste is dumped on land and in oceans. Plastics
discarded on land are exposed to oxygen and strong sunlight,
resulting in partial deterioration and cracking into pieces and
finally resulting in the formation of microplastics that cause
serious problems, particularly in the marine ecosystem
(Moore 2008). In addition to the microplastics found in the
environment, plastic microbeads are used in household prod-
ucts, such as toothpastes and cosmetics. Laundry produces
microplastics from fiber products, and these finally enter the
oceans through the sewage system (Browne et al. 2011). It is

very difficult to define microplastics by size as they include
tiny pieces of plastics of various shapes, such as net, ropes,
microbeads, and fibers. Microplastics have been defined as
plastic particles with size less than 1 mm by some scientists
and as particles with size less than 5 mm by others. Most
microplastics float in the water bodies and are accidently
swallowed by animals, birds, and fishes as food. In the
1960s, a whale with its stomach full of plastic bags was found
dead owing to starvation, and recent reports state that such
dead whales are found on many seashores every year irrespec-
tive of the season. Scientists have issued an alert that
microplastics are often found in the stomach of birds and fishes
and in seawater and thus may be ingested by humans via the
food chain. To complicate matters, plastics are hydrophobic
materials that absorb chemical compounds in the environment
(Teuten et al. 2009). Recently, the major cause for accidental
ingestion of microplastics by animals, birds, and fishes has
been reported to be their smell as food rather than their shape
or size (November 9, 2018, Science Advances: http://
advances.sciencemag.org/). It is, thus, a serious concern that
we may ingest microplastics with environmental pollutants in
the near future, a phenomenon that may have already started
(https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/
microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-first-time). There
is no doubt that microorganisms play important roles in the
cleanup of pollutants released by humans and in material
circulation in the ecosystem, and that microbial/enzymatic deg-
radation of polymeric materials has attracted worldwide atten-
tion since the 1990s.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the major plas-
tics, in addition to polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene,
polyvinyl chloride, and polyurethane, and its worldwide pro-
d u c t i o na m o u n t e dt o5 6m i l l i o nt o n si n2 0 1 3( N e u f e l de ta l .
2016). PET has various applications, such as in manufacturing
bottles, fibers, films, and containers. After use, PET bottles can
be recovered through many routes, and recycling systems op-
erate in many countries, although the overall recovery ratio is
less than half and only a limited amount is recycled as new
products. Currently, large amounts of PET debris are entering
landfills or are left as waste, and countermeasures are needed to
prevent its release in the environment and to recover used PET
waste via appropriate biological, chemical, and physical treat-
ments. Enzymatic recycling of PET has been investigated for
more than 20 years, and this research is still ongoing. Although
most biodegradable plas tics are polyesters (e.g.,
polyhydroxyalkanoate, polycaprolactone, polybutylene succi-
nate, polybutylene succinate-co -adipate, and poly(butylene
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)), PET, which is also a poly-
ester, is assumed to be recalcitrant to biodegradation. Polyesters
are categorized into three groups (aliphatic, aliphatic- co-aro-
matic, and aromatic). Aliphatic polyesters (natural and synthet-
ic) are hydrolyzed at ambient temperatures by various ester
bond hydrolases. Aliphatic- co-aromatic polyesters are rather
tough to degrade by enzymatic hydrolysis, but many probable
enzymes that degrade PBAT have been identified among car-
boxylic ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1), such as carboxylesterase
(EC 3.1.1.1), triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), and cutinases
(EC 3.1.1.74). Recently, microbial enzymes belonging to
arylesterase (EC 3.1.1.2) have been reported to degrade PBAT
(Wallace et al. 2017). Polyesterase acting on aromatic polyes-
ters (primarily PET) was first reported for Thermobifida fusca
by a German research group (Müller et al. 2005). Extensive
research on cutinases from T. fusca and other Thermobifida
species has been performed by several groups to date.
Cutinases are carboxylic ester hydrolases and first attracted at-
tention for their phytopathogenicity; they can degrade the cutin
of the cuticular layer in leaves or the suberin in bark. Research
on cutinases began with phyt opathogenic fungi, and the
cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi was the most extensively
characterized (Kollattukudy 1981; Heredia 2003).
Subsequently, through research on polyester degradation, it
was discovered that cutinases play an important role in the
hydrolysis of polyesters (Tokiwa and Calabia 2007;
Zimmermann and Billig 2011; Baker et al. 20
 12); indeed, all
known PET hydrolases belong to the cutinase group. Crystal
structures of PET-hydrolyzing cutinases have been studied to
specify the substrate-binding domain and to introduce mutation
to obtain better enzymes, as described below.
There are several excellent reviews of enzymatic PET hy-
drolysis and cutinases relevant to PET hydrolysis
(Zimmermann and Billig 2011;C h e ne ta l . 2013; Wei et al.
2014c; Nyyssölä 2015; Wei and Zimmermann 2017). The
field of X-ray crystallography has been advancing rapidly,
and several crystal structures of PET hydrolases have been
solved. Here, we discuss the current knowledge on enzymatic
degradation of PET while focusing on a key class of enzymes,
PET hydrolases, with regard to the definition of the enzymes,
requirements for PET hydrolysis, structural analyses of PET
hydrolases, and their reaction mechanisms. This review gives
a deep insight into the structural basis and dynamics of PET
hydrolases based on the recent progress in X-ray crystallogra-
phy. Based on the knowledge accumulated to date, we discuss
the various applications of PET hydrolysis, such as in design-
ing waste stream management.
Definition of PET hydrolases and factors
required for significant degradation of PET
The important mechanism of enzymatic PET degradation is
surface hydrophilization of PET fibers. For this purpose, only
surface modification is needed to improve factors such as
finishing fastness, dyeability, wettability, and anti-pilling behav-
ior, but degradation of the inner building block of PET is unfa-
vorable as it weakens the fiber strength. Many enzymatic treat-
ments have been tested using various hydrolases, such as lipases

from Candida antarctica (Vertommen et al. 2005),
Thermomyces lanuginosus (Eberl et al. 2009), Burkholderia
spp. (Lee and Chung 2009), and Triticum aestivum
(Nechwatal et al. 2006); cutinases from fungi, Aspergillus
oryzae, Humicola insolens ( R o n q v i s te ta l .2009), Penicillium
citrinum(Liebminger et al.2007), and Fusarium solani(Alisch-
Mark et al. 2006;O ’Neill et al. 2007); and those from actino-
mycetes, T. fusca (Brueckner et al. 2008), Thermobifida
cellulosilytica(Herrero Acero et al. 2011), Thermobifida alba
(Ribitsch et al.2012b), Saccharomonospora viridis(Kawai et al.
2017); esterase ( Thermobifida halotolerans , Ribitsch et al.
2012a); and carboxylesterases (Billig et al.2010). Even a prote-
ase, papain, can improve the hydrophilicity of polyester fabrics
(Kim and Song 2010). Biundo et al. ( 2018b) reviewed surface
engineering technology of polyester-degrading enzymes.
On the surface of PET, either fiber or film, the ends of
polymer chains are expected to protrude, or a part of the poly-
mer chain may form a loop, and these are hydrolyzed to car-
boxylic acid and hydroxyl residues, thus increasing surface
hydrophilicity (Fig.1a). The hydrolyzable-surface PET chains
are thought to comprise < 0.1% of amorphous PET film
(Goodfellow Cambridge, Ltd.) (PET-GF; 0.25 mm thick;
crystallinity of 6.3%) and amorphous PET film for packaging
(Sanwa Supply, Inc., Okayama, Japan) (PET-S; 0.6 mm thick;
crystallinity of 8.4%) (Oda et al. 2018)( T a b l eS1). Any textile
or film of PET may have a hydrolyzable polymer end or a loop
on their surface (Table S1)( K a w a ie ta l .2017; Zimmermann
and Billig 2011). Some researchers designated these modify-
ing enzymes as PET hydrolases. However, Müller et al.
(2005) first reported the apparent degradation of the inner
block of PET film, wherein the degradation rate is far higher
than that of surface hydrolyzable residues. Since then, several
cutinases have been reported to degrade the inner block of
PET film, for which commercially available PET-GF is often
used and can provide a standard for the comparison of their
PET hydrolysis abilities. We propose to categorize the en-
zymes into two groups: PE
 T surface–modifying enzymes that
limit the degradation rate at the surface hydrophilization level
without visible change by SEM observation and PET
hydrolases that can significantly degrade the inner block of
PET (by at least 10%) with visible change by SEM observa-
tion, as shown in Fig. 1a. PET hydrolases can be used for
surface hydrolysis, but PET surface –modifying enzyme can-
not significantly degrade the building block of PET. Here, we
focus on structural comparisons of PET hydrolases.
What factors are necessary for significant degradation of
the building blocks of PET? In general, the hydrophobicity,
crystallinity, surface topogr aphy, and molecular size of

synthetic polymers are important factors affecting their biode-
gradability (Tokiwa et al. 2009;W e b be ta l . 2013; Wei and
Zimmermann 2017). For PET hydrolysis, we must take addi-
tional factors into consideration. It is well known that the
polymer chain fluctuates at temperatures higher than the glass
transition temperature ( T
g). The Tg value of PET is approxi-
mately 80 °C, but it is lowered in water by water molecules
diffusing between polymer chains, resulting in increased chain
mobility (Kikkawa et al. 2004). Enzymatic reactions are per-
formed in aqueous solutions, in which Tg values of PET are
60–65 °C (Kawai et al. 2014). PET has water absorbency of
0.1–1.0%. Water molecules enter between the polymer chains,
weaken hydrogen bonds, randomize polymer chains, and
increase polymer chain flexibility, which increases their
accessibility to enzymes. Water absorbency must increase in
water and at higher temperatures. Therefore, it is expected that
higher PET hydrolase reaction temperatures will result in
faster rates of PET degradation, as reported by Kawai et al.
(2014) and Oda et al. ( 2018).
PET has different crystallinities according to its usage. Most
PET used for manufacturing bottles and textiles has high crys-
tallinity of 30–40%. However, PET used for packaging has less
crystallinity, e.g., approximately 8% (Kawai et al. 2014).
Commercially available low-crystallinity PET (PET-GF) has
approximately 6 –7% crystallinity (Ronqvist et al. 2009;
Kawai et al. 2014). Polyesterases are thought to preferentially
hydrolyze amorphous regions of PET (Welzel et al. 2002;
Brueckner et al. 2008; Ronqvist et al. 2009; Donelli et al.
2010; Gamerith et al. 2017), as shown in Fig. 1b. Increased
crystallinity limits the movement/fluctuation of polymer chains
and decreases the availability of polymer chains for enzymatic
attack. In addition, PET bottles and textiles are further
stretched to orient the polymer chains in order, and sometimes
PET is further biaxially oriented (bo); this strengthens the hy-
drogen bonds between polymer molecules and results in addi-
tional stretch-induced crystallization (Wei and Zimmermann
2017). The surface topology of PET materials is dependent
on the crystallinity and orientation during production. PET
bottles are typically formed as follows: PET pellets are melted
at approximately 270 °C and subjected to injection molding.
Consequently, the orientation of the polymer chain is different
depending on the different parts of a bottle. Unfortunately, no
PET hydrolases are known that can be applied for direct diges-
tion of PET bottles, textiles, and biaxially stretched films.
However, less crystalline PET can be significantly hydrolyzed
by several cutinases, as mentioned below.
In conclusion, when we consider enzymatic PET degrada-
tion, five factors must be addressed: (1) reaction temperatures,
preferably over T
g; (2) water absorbency, highly related to
temperature and crystallinity and orientation of polymer
chains; (3) crystallinity; (4) orientation of polymer chains, in
order or amorphous; and (5) surface topology, dependent on
the crystallinity and orientation of polymer chains. For a given
PET film, it is reasonable to consider that the higher the reac-
tion temperature, the higher the degradation rate will be. In
summary, PET hydrolysis is the interactive result of polymer
chain flexibility and cutinase structure (active site accessibility
to the polymer surface) (Zumstein et al. 2017).
Biochemical bases for PET hydrolases
The possibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of PET films was
first reported by Müller et al. ( 2005). They first purified an
enzyme from the culture supernatant of T. fusca (known as
the priority species in compost) that hydrolyzed
poly(butylene terephthalate-co -adipate) (BTA) and deter-
mined the amino acid sequence of BTA hydrolase 1
(Kleeberg et al. 2005). Müller et al. ( 2005) reported that
non-recombinant and recombinant hydrolases hydrolyzed
two kinds of PET films by approximately 40 –50% at 55 °C
in 3 weeks, although detailed information of the DNA se-
quence was not shown. GenBank accession AJ810119.1
indicates two genes coding for BTA hydrolases 1 and 2.
The genome of T. fusca YX was sequenced to determine
the presence of two triacylglycerol lipase genes ( Tfu0882
and Tfu0883)( L y k i d i se ta l .2007) that apparently code for
cutinase without a lid structure. The sequence of Tfu0883
is consistent with that of the gene for BTA-1 (see Table 1).
With regard to the activity on p-nitrophenol ( p-NP) acyl
ester, esterases act on short-chain acyl esters, cutinases
act on short –medium-chain acyl esters (approximately up
to C
8–C10), and lipases act on medium –long-chain acyl
esters (more than C 10). It is noteworthy that selectivity of
acyl length toward p-NP acyl ester is used to define
carboxylesterase s, but activity on p-NP acyl ester is not
correlated to the activity of PET hydrolysis (Heumann
et al. 2006;B i u n d oe ta l . 2018b). In our previous study
(Kawabata et al. 2017), no correlation was found between
the activities on p-NP butyrate and poly(butylene succi-
nate-co-adipate) (PBSA) (unpublished data). A strict defi-
nition of cutinases is dependent on the hydrolysis of cutin.
The cutinase activities of some polyesterases (e.g., BTA-1
and Tfu0883) were confirmed (Kleeberg et al. 2005;C h e n
et al. 2008), but those of some polyesterases (e.g., Cut190
and Tha_Cut1) were not analyzed (Kawai et al. 2014;
Ribitsch et al. 2012b). Cutin and its components are not
commercially available, and the determination of cutin hy-
drolysis is troublesome. However, cutin degradation is not
crucial for polyesterases, although cutinase activities are
important for plant pathogens (Kollattukudy 1981;
Heredia 2003). In addition, X-ray crystallography of PET
hydrolases and homologous enzymes (Fig. S1)a p p a r e n t l y
suggested that their structures were almost identical, irre-
spective of their origin. Therefore, it is reasonable to cate-
gorize all of them as cutinase members.

Based on the genome sequence of T. fusca YX, Chen
et al. ( 2008) cloned two cutinases (Tfu_882 and Tfu_883,
with the activity of the latter being higher than that of the
former) from a laboratory stock of T. fusca and reported
that the amino acid sequence of Tfu_883 is identical to
BTA hydrolase 1. A set of cutinases have been cloned
from T. fusca KW3 (Herrero Acero et al. 2011) and from
T. fusca sp. NRRL B-8184 (Hegde and Veeranki 2013).
Other groups have also cloned cutinases from T. fusca
(Table 1). Acetylxylan esterase cloned from T. fusca
NTU22 (TfAXE) also exhibits high similarity to cutinases
(Huang et al. 2010 ). T. fusca cutinases are the most
researched among actinomycete cutinases, which are
expressed in hosts other than Escherichia coli ,s u c ha s
Streptomyces rimosus (Sinsereekul et al. 2010 ),
Streptomyces lividans ( L ie ta l . 2013), Bacillus
megaterium (Yang et al. 2007), and Pichia pastoris
X-33 (TfAXE; Yang et al. 2010).
Hu et al. ( 2008) suggested the presence of thermostable
polyesterases (most probably cutinases) in versatile thermo-
philic bacteria (primarily actinomycetes and Bacillus species)
obtained from compost and cloned a new cutinase (Est119)
from T. alba AHK119 (Hu et al. 2010). T. alba AHK119 pos-
sessed two tandem cutinase genes (est119(est2)a n d est1, with
the activity of the latter being higher than that of the former)
(Thumarat et al. 2015). A cutinase from T. alba DSM43185
was also cloned by Ribitsch et al. ( 2012b). On the other hand,
Herrero Acero et al. ( 2011) cloned two cutinases from
T. cellulosilytica DSM44535, viz. Tc_Cut1 and Tc_Cut2, the
amino acid sequences of which are identical to those of
Tfu_0883 and Tfu_0882, respectively, from T. fusca YX.
Tc_Cut1 showed higher activity than Tc_Cut2, indicating the
surface hydrolysis of the PET film (crystallinity of 37%) at 50
°C for 120 h. All Thermobifida species so far reported have
indicated the presence of tandem cutinase genes, which share
high homology with each other, but their activity levels differ
immensely. Homologies of cutinase genes conserved in
Thermobifidaare high even among species. A possible expla-
nation for this is that the ancestral cutinase possessing polyester
degradability, most probably originating from a species of
The
rmobifida, was copied in one species and then a set of
cutinase genes was transferred to other species and the same
events were repeated. As the cutinase genes of T. fusca and
T. cellulosilytica are almost identical, either of these species
may contain the ancestral gene. Perz et al. (2016 )c l o n e dt w o
genes coding for the esterases Cbotu_EstA and Cbotu_EstB
from an anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium botulinum ATCC
3502, and analyzed the crystal structure of the more efficient
enzyme Cbotu_EstA. Cbotu_EstA could hydrolyze PET at 50
°C only by a marginal level, but truncation of the N-terminal
71 residues exposed a hydrophobic patch on the surface, sim-
ilar to a cutinase, and introduction of mutation in the zinc-
binding domain improved the hydrolytic activity on PET at
50 °C (Biundo et al. 2018a) .B a s e do nt h ec o m p l e t eg e n o m e
sequence of Thermomonospora curvata -type strain (B9)
(Chertkov et al. 2011), Tcur1278 and Tcur0390 have been
cloned from T. curvata DSM43183 (Wei et al. 2014b).
T. curvata is a thermophilic actinomycete phylogenetically re-
lated to T. fusca and possesses two homologous genes coding
for hydrolases; these hydrolases are most probably cutinases,
although their activities on cutin have not been examined. Both
enzymes shared 62% sequence identity with BTA hydrolase 1
and decomposed PET nanoparticles (no crystallinity), but it is
questionable whether they can significantly degrade PET film,
e.g., PET-GF, as their thermostability is at most 50 °C for
Tcur1278 and < 50 °C for Tcur0390 for 60 min. A temperature
higher than 60 °C is required for significant degradation of
PET-GF (Zimmermann and Billig 2011; Kawai et al. 2014;
Oda et al. 2018). An esterase cloned from T. halotolerans
DSM44931 has high homology with actinomycete cutinases
and can hydrophilize PET film at 50 °C (Ribitsch et al. 2012a),
although no information was given about the origin of the PET
film and its properties, such as crystallinity. Kawai et al. (2014)
cloned a cutinase-like enzyme (Cut190) from S. viridis
AHK190 isolated from compost. Sulaiman et al. (2012) cloned
a cutinase (LC-cutinase) based on the metagenomic library
from leaf-branch compost, which is considered to be a mixed
gene pool of cutinase genes from compost actinomycetes. It
can be concluded that thermophilic actinomycetes are the most
promising microbial sources of PET hydrolases. Table 1 sum-
marizes the recombinant cutinases and homologous enzymes,
including cutinases from T. fusca (Müller et al. 2005; Then
et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2014c) and S. viridis (Kawai et al.
2014), and metagenomes (Sulaiman et al. 2014) corresponding
to PET hydrolases, as defined above.
Ronqvist et al. ( 2009) compared the catalytic activities of
cutinases from H. insolens (HiC), Pseudomonas mendocina,
and F . solani using low-crystallinity (lc) and bo PET films
(b
oth are commercial products from Goodfellow Cambridge,
Ltd.; lcPET is the same as PET-GF). HiC degrades lcPET
tremendously at 70 °C, but other cutinases showed far lower
degradability at 50 °C and 40 °C, as their thermostability is
less than 50 °C. The degradation rate of HiC at 70 °C reached
approximately 100% in 96 h, but under the same reaction
conditions with HiC, no measurable weight loss of boPET
was observed. The crystallinity of lcPET increased from 7.0
± 0.5 to 9% under control conditions heated without an en-
zyme at 70 °C for 96 h, and the cold crystallization peak
shifted to a lower temperature compared to the initial sample,
a phenomenon known to occur for even small changes in
crystallinity (Pingping and Dezhu 1997). HiC-treated film
did not exhibit a distinct crystallization peak, suggesting a
drastic change in the polymer structure. In aqueous solutions
at 70 °C, lcPET film must increase water absorbency, loosen
orientation of polymer chains, and increase accessibility of
polymer chains to the enzyme. In addition, degradation of an
4258 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:4253 –4268
amorphous region may affect a crystalline region, finally
resulting in complete degradation. HiC was provided by
Novozymes (Bagsvaerd, Denmark), and its exact sequence
information and structural analysis are unavailable, although
some crystal structures of cutinases from H. insolens have
been obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and used
for comparison with other cutinases, as described below.
Yoshida et al. (2016) isolated Ideonella sakaiensis prolifer-
ating on an amorphous PET film (1.9% crystallinity) at 30 °C
for 40 days and cloned a gene for PETase. PETase shares 45 –
53% amino acid sequence identity with the actinomycete
cutinases (Fig. S2). However, the degradation rate of the
PET film was too low for the degradation of the inner block
of PET (not mentioned in the study but can be calculated to be
at most less than 1%) (Table S2), and the enzyme is heat-labile
and therefore lacks the requisite features to be defined as a
PET hydrolase, as described above. When we incubated two
kinds of amorphous films and PET microfiber with a Cut190*
mutant (Cut190*/Q138A/D250C-E296C, where Cut190* is
Cut190/S226P/R228S) at 30 °C, the total products amounted
to approximately 0.01 –0.03% of the weights of two films in
22 h and were almost constant thereafter (Table S1). However,
PET microfiber (crystallinity of 14.1%) was significantly hy-
drolyzed to approximately 25% with increased time, although
the microfiber has much higher crystallinity. The difference
between the hydrolysis rates of the films and microfiber is
thought to be dependent on the surface dimension and
orientation/surface topology of PET. As the same microfiber
is completely degraded by Cut190*/Q138A at 65 °C in 15 h
(Oda et al. 2018), the crystalline part must be susceptible to
enzymatic attack. The results obtained with HiC also indicated
that the crystalline part is attacked (Ronqvist et al. 2009). We
suggest that the amorphous region is attacked first, which
must make the crystalline region susceptible to enzymatic at-
tack, and finally both the amorphous and crystalline regions
are digested. The polymer chains must become sufficiently
flexible to be susceptible to enzymatic attack. A microfiber
has no orientation of polymer chains, which is most likely a
major cause for the enzymatic attack at 30 °C, but polymer
chains of PET-GF and PET-S become sufficiently flexible for
enzymatic attack at 60–65 °C. Therefore, whether PETase can
be a PET hydrolase and whether PETase can hydrolyze PET-
GF at 30 °C still remain to be determined.
PETase has been crystallized independently by several
groups (Han et al. 2018; Joo et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018;
Fecker et al. 2018;A u s t i ne ta l .2018) to investigate its ability
to degrade PET. The crystal structure of PETase and its se-
quence homology with cutinases apparently indicated that
PETase is a member of the cutinases. As none of these studies
on PETase used PET-GF film, as often used by other re-
searchers (Ronqvist et al. 2009; Kawai et al. 2014;T h e n
et al. 2015), it is extremely difficult to compare their results
with previous reports and to evaluate their exact ability, but
classification of PETase as a PET hydrolase is questionable.
The physical properties of a film, the crystallinity and orien-
tation of polymer chains and the surface topology, must se-
verely affect enzyme attack and the resultant degradability.
In summary, there is no doubt that all effective PET hydro-
lases and even PBAT-degrading enzymes are cutinases and
homologous enzymes. The unique properties of cutinases
are dependent on their protein structures that lack a lid cover-
ing the active site, although lids are found to cause interfacial
activation in lipases. Cutinases generally possess shallow,
open active sites that are exposed to the solvent. These reasons
can explain why PET hydrolases are limited to cutinases, al-
though surface modification of PET is possible with lipases,
esterases, and cutinases. Esterases are defined as exhibiting
higher activity on short-chain acyl esters of p-NP
(Bornscheuer 2002), suggesting that they may not recognize
hydrophobic PET. However, cutinases act on longer acyl es-
ters of p-NP than esterases and on hydrophobic cutin (Chen
et al. 20
13 ). Cutinases were first studied from pathogenic fun-
gi, typically F . solani pisi that utilizes a cutinase to invade the
cuticular layer of plants (Kollattukudy 1981; Heredia 2003).
The name cutinase is derived from cutin existing in the cutic-
ular layer of plants. Non-pathogenic fungi, such as P . citrinum
(Liebminger et al. 2007)a n d H. insolens (Ronqvist et al.
2009), also produce cutinases. Except for HiC, no fungal
PET hydrolases have been documented to date.
Cutinases were grouped into fungal cutinases, including
those from phytopathogenic and non-phytopathogenic fungi
and bacterial cutinases, including those from actinomycetes
and others. PETase has a sequence identity of more than
65% with many hydrolases from non-thermophilic bacteria
(their ability to degrade PET has not been reported), among
which poly(tetramethylene succinate) depolymerase (acces-
sion number AB066349) from Acidovorax delafieldii strain
BS-3 (Uchida et al. 2002) showed the highest sequence iden-
tity of 82%. The phylogenetic tree of bacterial cutinases indi-
cated that PETase formed a group with hydrolases from non-
thermophilic bacteria and actinomycete cutinases formed a
separate group (Fig. 2).
Structural analyses of cutinases by X-ray
crystallography
Cutinases first attracted attention for their role in
phytopathogenicity. The crystal structure of a cutinase from
the phytopathogenic fungus ( F . solani pisi ) has been well
studied (Martinez et al. 1992; Longhi et al. 1997a, b).
Subsequently, many aliphatic polyester–assimilating microor-
ganisms were isolated, and their polyesterases were character-
ized as cutinases (Tokiwa and Calabia 2007; Zimmermann
and Billig 2011; Baker et al. 2012). Following the discovery
of PET hydrolase by Müller et al. ( 2005), several groups have
Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:4253 –4268 4259
cloned aromatic polyesterase genes from thermophilic actino-
mycetes, as described above. Some polyesterases are capable
of cutin hydrolysis and their crystal structures are essentially
identical to each other, suggesting that aromatic polyesterases
belong to the cutinase group. The first crystallization of an
actinomycete cutinase was reported for Est119 from T. alba
AHK119 (Kitadokoro et al. 2012). Est119 was analyzed as an
alpha/beta hydrolase with nine beta strands surrounded by
eight alpha helices, based on the crystal structure of a
homologous lipase from Streptomyces exfoliatus, (PDB ID:
1JFR) that is apparently a cutinase-like enzyme with no lid
(Wei et al. 1998). Subsequently, the crystal structures of sev-
eral cutinases from actinomycetes were analyzed by X-ray
crystallography (Table 1), viz. LC-cutinase from a
metagenome (Sulaiman et al. 2014), TfCut2 from T. fusca
KW3 (Roth et al. 2014), Cut190 from S. viridis AHK190
(Miyakawa et al. 2015;N u m o t oe ta l . 2018), and Thc_Cut1
from T. cellulosilytica (Ribitsch et al. 2017), and these shared
Fig. 2 Phylogenetic tree for amino acid sequences of the reported PET
hydrolases and their homologs. A multiple alignment and a tree were
constructed using the program ClustalW2 (Larkin et al. 2007). The tree
was generated by the neighbor-joining algorithm using sites without any
gaps and was displayed as a midpoint-rooted tree using the program
Dendroscape 3 (Huson and Scornavacca 2012). Numbers on the
ancestor nodes are bootstrap values calculated by 1000 bootstrap
samples. Actinomycete cutinases are represented using the enzyme
names shown in Table 1. Six additional homologs for PETase were
taken from the UniProt/TrEMBL database. GenBank accession
AB066349 is poly(tetramethylene s uccinate) depolymerase from
Acidovorax delafieldii (Uchida et al. 2002). The other five accession
IDs are uncharacterized proteins found in bacteria as follows:
ARN19491.1 and ARN19002.1 are from Rhizobacter gummiphilus ,
OGB27210.1 and OGB26481.1 are from Burkholderiales bacterium,
and AKJ29164.1 is from Polyangium brachysporum .T w or e m o t e
bacterial homologs (ADK73612.1 and CAA37220.1) were included to
determine the root. ADK73612.1 is cutinase A from Pseudomonas
pseudoalcaligenes, and CAA37220.1 is lipase 1 from Moraxella sp.
(strain TA144)
4260 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:4253 –4268
approximately the same size and structure (Fig. S1).
Miyakawa et al. ( 2015) determined the active (Ca 2+-bound)
and inactive (Ca2+-unbound) forms of Cut190_S226P . This is
the only reported cutinase for which the inactive form occurs
in the absence of Ca 2+; other homologous cutinases always
retain the active forms. The active form of cutinases is similar
to each other, including the active form of Cut190 (Oda et al.
2018). The crystal structures of Cut190* complexed with
Ca2+/Zn2+ and model substrates (monoethyl succinate and
monoethyl adipate) have been solved (PDB IDs: 5ZNO,
5ZRQ, 5ZRR, and 5ZRS) (Numoto et al. 2018) (Fig. 3a).
Roth et al. ( 2014) analyzed the crystal structure of TfCut2
complexed with a competitive inhibitor,
phenylmethanesulfonic acid (PDB ID: 4CG2).
As described above, it is questionable whether PETase can
significantly degrade PET-GF film because the reported sig-
nificant degradation of this film was performed at 65 –70 °C,
although the amino acid sequence of PETase is similar to
those of actinomycete cutinases. Several research groups have
been successful in crystallizing PETase (Han et al. 2018;L i u
et al. 2018; Joo et al. 2018;F e c k e re ta l . 2018;A u s t i ne ta l .
2018). Han et al. ( 2018) obtained the crystal structure of a
PETase mutant complexed with a PET model compound,
1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate (HEMT) (Fig.
3b), and reported that the additional disulfide bond besides
the disulfide bond commonly found in cutinases is unique to
PETase (Fig. 3ba n dF i g .S2), but PETase is heat-labile and its
degradation ability is very low even for PET film with a very
low crystallinity. Actinomycete cutinases have only one disul-
fide bond (Fig. 3a), but their thermostability is sufficient for
degradation of PET-GF. We introduced one more disulfide
bond in Ca
2+ binding site 2 of Cut190* (Fig. 3aa n dF i g .S2)
and confirmed the remarkable raise of Tm value (Oda et al.
2018). The resultant overall structure of PETase overlapped
well with those of actinomycete cutinases, but the enzyme had
a broader, open active-site cleft than those in homologous
cutinases (Joo et al. 2018; Austin et al. 2018; Chen et al.
2018). Austin et al. ( 2018) reported that narrowing the binding
cleft via mutation of two amino acids in the active site to
conserve amino acids among homologous cutinases improves
PET degradation, suggesting that PETase is not fully opti-
mized for PET degradation. Chen et al. ( 2018)a r g u e da g a i n s t
Austin et al. ( 2018), stating that “W156 wobbling”is different
from that in other cutinases, although amino acid residues in
the substrate-binding pocket are conserved or semi-conserved
in PETase and homologous cutinases. In addition, S185,
which was mutated to S185H by Austin et al. ( 2018), is a
critical residue that endows W156 with its flexibility.
Very recently, Kitadokoro et al. ( 2019) solved the crystal
structure of Est119 complexed with ethyl lactate (PDB ID:
6AID). The overall structures of the cutinase –substrate com-
plexes are almost identical, but slight variations are observed
in the loop regions. Therefore, irrespective of their inability to
degrade the building blocks of PET, these cutinases share the
same structures as those of PET hydrolases. It is noteworthy
that a specific substrate-binding domain is absent in these

main chains are shown in ribbon models, the side chains of catalytic triads

Note that serine in the catalytic triad (S176 or S131) is replaced with
alanine. a Cut190 (PDB ID: 5ZNO), which has three Ca 2+ binding sites
and one SS bond. The bound substrate (ethyl succinate) is taken from
PDB ID: 5ZRR. b PETase (PDB ID: 5XH3), which has no Ca 2+ binding
site and two SS bonds. The bound substrate is 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-
methyl terephthalate. Molecular graphics were generated using UCSF

cutinases, unlike polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase (Knoll
et al. 2009) and cellulase (Atthoff and Hilborn 2007). The
hydrophobic regions surrounding the catalytic site most prob-
ably contribute to absorption on the PET surface (Herrero
Acero et al. 2011; Kitadokoro et al. 2012, accepted 2019;
Kawabata et al. 2017).
Fungal cutinases (from F . solani and H. insolens )h a v e
homologous structures that are smaller than those of actino-
mycete cutinases. Cbotu_EstA has the largest structure among
cutinase-related enzymes (Table 1), even after the N-terminal
71 residues are removed (Fig. S3).
In summary, the basic structure of PET hydrolases must
incorporate the following features: the shallow open active
site should be accessible to the solvent, the active cleft should
have an appropriate space for bulky aromatic compounds, and
the active cleft region should have affinity with hydrophobic
materials. Moreover, thermostability is needed for significant
degradation of the PET building block.
The role of divalent cations in catalysis
Although only Cut190 displays both active (Ca 2+-bound)
(PDB IDs: 4WFJ and 4WFK) and inactive (Ca 2+-free) (PDB
ID: 4WFI) states (Miyakawa et al. 2015), the active state cor-
responds to those of Est119 and other cutinases (PDB IDs:
4EB0, 3VIS, 3WYN, 4CG1, 4CG2, 4CG3, and 5LUI, 5LUJ,
5LUK, and 5LUL) (Sulaiman et al. 2014; Kitadokoro et al.
2012; Kawai et al. 2013; Roth et al. 2014; Ribitsch et al.
2017). The activities and thermal stabilities of these cutinases
increase in the presence of Ca
2+ and Mg2+ (Kawai et al. 2013,
2014; Sulaiman et al. 2014; Thumarat et al. 2012;T h e ne ta l .
2015;M i y a k a w ae ta l .2015). Est119 retains the same overall
structure with or without Ca 2+ (PDB IDs: 3WYN and 3VIS).
C u t i n a s e s1a n d2f r o m T. cellulosilytica (Thc_Cut1 and
Thc_Cut2) and Thc_Cut2 mutants, either bound or not bound
to Mg
2+ or Ca2+ (PDB IDs: 5LUI, 5LUJ, 5LUK, and 5LUL),
also retain the same overall structures. Three Ca 2+ bind at
three different sites in the mutant S176A of Cut190* (PDB
ID: 5ZNO) (Numoto et al. 2018)( F i g .3a), and their roles have
been analyzed by mutation (Oda et al. 2018). Binding of Ca
2+
at site 1 (Ser76, Ala78, Phe81, and Asn133) is unique to
Cut190 (related to activation), but binding at site 2 (Glu220,
Asp250, and Glu296) is common in Est119 and other
cutinases (related to thermostabilization). These three amino
acids at site 2 are well conserved among cutinases as shown in
Fig. S2.C a
2+ binding at site 3 (Asp204 and Thr206) has not
been reported for cutinases other than Cut190 (subsidiary to
sites 1 and 2). Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicated
that the Ca2+-bound structure fluctuates less than the Ca2+-free
structure, leading to higher thermal stability (Inaba et al. 2018;
Numoto et al. 2018). We recently analyzed the effect of vari-
ous divalent cations (Zn 2+,M n 2+,a n dM g 2+) on the activity
and thermal stability of Cut190* compared with that of Ca 2+
(Senga et al. 2019). Zn 2+ can readily replace Ca 2+ (Numoto
et al. 2018), but the enzyme activity of Cut190* in the pres-
ence of Zn 2+ is very low. However, the activity of Cut190*
with Mn 2+ and Mg 2+ is maintained to some extent but it is
lower than that with Ca 2+.
Then et al. ( 2015)r e p o r t e dt h a tC a2+ and Mg2+ increase Tm
values of T. fusca cutinases (TfH, BTA2, Tfu_882, TfCut1,
and TfCut2) by 10.8 –14.1 °C. The thermostabilities of these
polyesterases are sufficient to enable degradation of PET-GF at
65 °C in the presence of 10 mM Ca 2+ or Mg2+,b u tC a2+ shows
better results in general. The activity was highest with TfH, and
Tf_Cut2 showed an almost identical activity to that of TfH.
The binding sites of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ in TfCut2 have been
calculated by independent MD simulations and were the same
to site 2 in Cut190*. The roles of Ca 2+ and Mg2+ in Thc_Cut2
have not been elucidated yet, but they are most probably the
same as those in TfCut2. Cbotu_EstA has a zinc-binding do-
main, and mutation of amino acids in this domain increases the
activity on PET without changing the zinc-binding ability
(Biundo et al. 2018a). The role of this zinc-binding domain
remains to be elucidated but would appear to be different from
those of metal-binding domains in cutinases.
Further studies are needed to determine whether metal ions
are relevant to the reaction in other cutinases.
Catalytic mechanism for hydrolysis of PET
by cutinases
Both endo-type and exo-type hydrolases of glucans (e.g., amy-
lases and cellulases) are known, but no exo-type hydrolase of
polyesters has been reported to date. Endo-type hydrolysis has
been indicated for PET because matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of
the residual insoluble materials indicated an increase in the tet-
ramer fragment of PET (average Mw = 3500) (Eberl et al.
2009). Herrero Acero et al. (2011) suggested that PET hydroly-
sis is catalyzed by endo-type scission to cleave internal ester
bonds using bis(benzoyloxyethyl)terephthalate (3PET).
Hydrolysis products of PET, bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate
(BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET), and
terephthalic acid (TPA), have been identified, although the ratio
of products differs based on the enzyme concentration used,
incubation temperature, and time (Vertommen et al. 2005;
Ronqvist et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2012; Barth et al. 2015). TPA
is regarded as the final product (Vertommen et al. 2005;E b e r l
et al. 2009; Ronqvist et al. 2009; Barth et al. 2015;O d ae ta l .
2018). However, a surface erosion process is suggested for the
enzymatic hydrolysis of PET (Zhang et al. 2004;M ü l l e re ta l .
2005;M ü l l e r2006; Wei et al. 2014a). The classical Michaelis–
Menten enzyme kinetic model can be used for homogeneous
reactions and is based on enzyme-limiting conditions. However,
4262 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:4253 –4268
insoluble polymer degradation is limited to the surface of the
substrate (substrate-limiting). The degradation of PET film
should follow a heterogeneous kinetic model based on
substrate-limiting conditions (Ronqvist et al. 2009). In contrast,
Barth et al. (2015) analyzed hydrolysis of PET nanoparticles
based on enzyme-limiting conditions. Mutation of Cut190*
has been evaluated by the decrease in turbidity of a PBSA sus-
pension (Kawai et al. 2014; Kawabata et al. 2017;O d ae ta l .
2018), which is based on enzyme-limiting conditions.
PETase showed no significant conformational changes in
the main chain structure upon ligand binding, and the active
site is wider than that of other cutinases (Han et al. 2018;
Chen et al. 2018). These authors of this work proposed that
W156 wobbling in PETase (adjacent S185 allows a space
for W156 to rotate) is important for substrate binding and
product release (Fig. S4b), but W155 in TfCut2 cannot wob-
ble as the side chain of H184 stacks with the side chain of
W155. However, as TfCut2 and other homologous cutinases
can significantly hydrolyze PET-GF, there is no doubt that
their active sites can efficiently bind the substrate. Numoto
et al. ( 2018) indicated that no movement of W201 in
Cut190* (corresponding to W156 in PETase and W155 in
TfCut2) is observed, but the opposite amino acids, F106 and
T107, derive different conformations upon substrate binding
(Fig. S4a). Several other differences were found between
PETase and Cut190*. PETase shows no significant structural
differences on substrate docking, except for the movement
of W156, but the β1–β2, β3–α2, and β4–α3 loops of
Cut190* derive different conformations upon substrate
docking and reaction product release. The benzene ring of
HEMT is T-stacked to an aromatic ring of W156 of PETase
but not to that of Y58 because benzene rings of W156 and
of Y58 are not parallel (PDB ID: 5XH3). In contrast, the
aromatic rings of W201 and F106 are parallel in Cut190*
complexed with model substrates (PDB IDs: 5ZRR and
5ZRS) (Fig. S4a). As predicted in the 3D docking structure
of Cut190* with a PET model compound (TETETET, where
T and E are terephthalate and ethylene glycol units, respec-
tively) (Kawabata et al. 2017), a benzene ring would be T-
stacked to W201 and F106 and then M177 would support a
benzene ring from below. In either case, fluctuation of aro-
matic amino acids is considered important for fixing a ben-
zene ring of PET by T stacking. In addition, a short tunnel
covering an active site is formed in Cut190* (Numoto et al.
2018). The tunnel structure has also been suggested for the
reaction mechanism of exo-cellulases, wherein
cellobiohydrolase slides on a cellulose molecule by hydro-
lyzing it to cellobiose (Divne et al. 1994). Whether a similar
mechanism is observed in Cut190* has yet to be elucidated
in detail. Cut190* may be adsorbed on a loose polymer
chain on the surface and may hydrolyze an ester bond, re-
leasing the carboxylic end of the TPA portion and the hy-
droxyl end of the ethylene glycol portion. Furthermore, one
possible mechanism is the detachment of Cut190* from the
polymer chain to attach onto a new polymer chain (route 1).
Another possible mechanism is that Cut190* stays and
slides on the polymer chain (route 2) while keeping a short
tunnel and forms a new tetrahedron structure necessary for
the catalysis, which must be continued until arriving at the
end of a polymer chain or the crystalline region, and then
forms an open structure to accept a new polymer chain. The
proposed routes (1 and 2) are illustrated in Fig. S5.
Prospective applications of PET hydrolases
in PET waste management and other fields
The majority of plastics are disposed of within 1 year after
manufacture. Of these, 14% of packaging materials are cur-
rently collected for recycling and another 14% are incinerated
for energy recovery, but 40% of plastics are landfilled and 32%
escape the collection system (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and
World Economic Forum, 2014; http://www3.weforum.org/
docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf). Plastic waste
that escapes the collection system enters natural
environments— on land and in oceans. Plastics already threat-
en wildlife and are entering the food chain as microplastics.
The reduction in the use of plastics and the replacement of
petroleum-based plastics with natural materials and bio-based
plastics are required and planned. The development of
recycling systems must be established concurrently.
Because of its excellent physical and chemical properties,
PET has various applications in textiles, packaging materials,
and bottles. PET bottles are systematically collected and can
be recycled as bottles and polyester fibers. To stop the limit-
less increase in production and to promote recovery, recycling
of used PET bottles should be simple and requires urgent
countermeasures. A Japanese company (TEIJIN) practiced
the recycling of polyester fibers and PET bottles under the
project “ECOCIRCLE” since 2002, with the recycled PET
being exported to China. However, this project was stopped
in 2018 because the Chinese government announced a ban on
importation of materials produced from plastic waste in 2017,
and trading of used PET bottles (the raw material for the
recycling) became uneconomical. On January 17, 2019,
CARBIOS ( https://carbios.fr/ ) and Toulouse White
Biotechnology (TWB) announced the receipt of EUR 7.5 mil-
lion funding, over a period of 39 months, from the
Investments for the Future program operated by ADEME
(the French Environment and Energy Management Agency)
to accelerate the industrialization of the bio-recycling of PET
plastics and fibers. Chemical recycling of PETwaste produced
during the production process can be practiced in situ. The
major problems are recycling and appropriate treatment of
PET waste after use. Plastic recycling is categorized into three
Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:4253 –4268 4263
types: thermal recycling (used as fuels), material recycling
(melted and reused once), and chemical recycling (converted
to raw materials and used for synthesis, which can be repeat-
ed). The most desirable type is chemical recycling, for which
PET hydrolase can be used. As described above, enzymatic
hydrolysis cannot yet be applied to bottles and fibers, although
every researcher in this field seeks to apply their enzymes to
any PET waste, including tough materials such as bottles and
fibers. However, research for some enzymes has already
reached practical levels for their application to amorphous
PET films used in packaging (Wei and Zimmermann 2017).
Polymeric materials with high polymerization degrees (e.g.,
100) have rather different physicochemical properties from those
with low polymerization degrees (e.g., 10 –50 carbon atoms),
and the latter can be taken up by a cell for further metabolization
(Lucas et al. 2008; Restrepo-Flórez et al.2014). Depolymerized
PET up to 10 –50 carbon atoms is likely to be susceptible to
attack by PET hydrolases to form TPA and ethylene glycol, as
3PET and cyclic trimers that a re readily hydrolyzed by
carboxylesterases (Billig et al. 2010; Eberl et al. 2009;
Figueroa et al. 2006;H e r r e r oA c e r oe ta l .2011; Ribitsch et al.
2012a,b). In addition, micronization of PET materials markedly
improves their subsequent biodegradation by increasing the ac-
cessible surface area for polyesterases (Gamerith et al.2016 and
2017). Therefore, chemical or physical pretreatment of plastic
waste may be required in biocatalytic recycling (Wei and
Zimmermann2017). Appropriate pretreatment would promote
the efficiency of enzymatic recycling of PET. Donelli et al.
(2010) compared the surface structural changes induced on
PET films by alkali and cutinase treatments and observed that
both treatments induced structural and conformational
rearrangements with a consequent increase in crystallinity.
Quartinello et al. ( 2017) depolymerized PET fiber (at 250 °C
a n d3 9b a r )t oap o w d e rc o n s i s t i n go f8 5 %T P A ,a n dt h er e m a i n -
ing oligomers were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by a
cutinase, finally yielding TPA with 97% purity that is compara-
ble to synthesis grade TPA (98% purity).
As described in the “Introduction,” microplastics are al-
ready found in the intestines of wild animals, indicating that
microplastics could be ingested by humans via the food chain.
Microplastics are produced from plastic waste left in the en-
vironment and from wastewater treatment plants. For the latter
source, one approach to improve polymer degradation in
wastewater would utilize polymer-degrading enzymes and
their microbial producers (Haernvall et al. 2018). Synthetic
polyesters are the second largest class of ingredients in house-
hold products that enter sewage plants. Polyesterases must
have broad substrate specificities to be useful for sewage treat-
ment. This kind of application may cause a serious controver-
sy as mutants are more effective than the wild type, and should
be cloned in appropriate hosts. Therefore, release of the re-
combinant microbes and safety of the ecosystem must be
carefully evaluated and balanced.
Cut190, Est119, and Est1 have broad substrate specificity
toward various polyesters, aliphatic, aliphatic-co-aromatic, and
PET. BTA hydrolase was originally expected to hydrolyze
BTA, but PET hydrolytic activity was confirmed later
(Kleeberg et al. 2005; Müller et al. 2005). Broad substrate
specificities are generally expected for actinomycete cutinases.
In other words, these cutinases can be used for polyester
recycling of aliphatic and aliphatic- co-aromatic polyesters,
and amorphous PET. For example, vessels or containers made
of biodegradable/bio-based materials do not need to be frac-
tionated as they are subjected to enzymatic digestion by these
PET hydrolases. Biodegradable/bio-based polymers are not
currently targeted for recycling, but their waste treatment after
use will become an environmental issue in the future.
Polyesterases with broad substrate specificities are more desir-
able than those with substrate specificities for certain materials.
PET hydrolases can be applied for the functionalization of
general polyesters in addition to PET, which displays carboxyl
and hydroxyl groups on the surface, without damaging the
bulk properties of polyesters, and they may be useful for
forming a complex structure with chemicals.
As
emphasized in this review, PET hydrolase must be ther-
mostable, not only because PET hydrolysis needs a higher
temperature than the Tg value (preferably 65–70 °C in aqueous
solution) but also because the degradation of other polyesters is
promoted at higher temperatures. In addition, high tempera-
tures over 55 °C contribute to the disinfection of digested plas-
tic waste. Thermostable enzymes are beneficial for applications
because catalysis increases at elevated temperatures and the
biocatalysts can be maintained for a long time at ambient tem-
peratures. PET hydrolases are cutinases, and their application to
various fields is already well known (Carvalho et al. 1999;
Bornscheuer 2002; Pio and Macedo 2009;C h e ne ta l . 2013;
Nyyssölä 2015). Hence, thermostable enzymes are desirable.
Finally, it should be noted that research on PET hydrolases
is also contributing new advances in biocatalysis research.
Enzyme reactions are, in general, good at attacking water-
soluble or liquid materials, but polyesterases must attack solid
materials. For the hydrolysis of PET, we need to understand
the properties of PET materials and the structures of PET
hydrolases. For PET, enzymatic kinetics do not follow the
classical Michaelis –Menten model for homogeneous reac-
tions but necessitate a different kinetic model for heteroge-
neous reactions.
