Enantioselective reduction of sulfur-containing
cyclic imines through biocatalysis
Nadine Zumbrägel1, Christian Merten 2, Stefan M. Huber3 & Harald Gröger1
The 3-thiazolidine ring represents an important structural motif in life sciences molecules.
However, up to now reduction of 3-thiazolines as an attractive approach failed by means of
nearly all chemical reduction technologies for imines. Thus, the development of an efﬁcient
general and enantioselective synthetic technology giving access to a range of such hetero-
cycles remained a challenge. Here we present a method enabling the reduction of
3-thiazolines with high conversion and high to excellent enantioselectivity (at least 96% and
up to 99% enantiomeric excess). This technology is based on the use of imine reductases
as catalysts, has a broad substrate range, and is also applied successfully to other
sulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Moreover the efﬁency
of this biocatalytic technology platform is demonstrated in an initial process development
leading to 99% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess at a substrate loading of 18 g/L in
the presence of designer cells.

yclic amines with a sulfur-atom in the heterocyclic struc-
ture play a distinguished role in nature and medicine. In
particular, this is true for the 3-thiazolidine ring, which is
one of the two heterocyclic framework structures present in
penicillins and penicillin-derived β-lactam antibiotic drugs such
as amoxicillin
1. The 3-thiazolidine moiety is also a structural
motif in a range of HIV protease inhibitors2 and an industrial key
intermediate for the production of the non-proteinogenic amino
acid D-penicillamine3 (Fig. 1). In addition, spiro-type 3-
thiazolidines showed activity in human tumor cell lines4, and 3-
thiazolidines with a less functionalized, alkyl-substitution pattern
are of pharmaceutical interest with applications, e.g., as radio-
protective agents 5,6. Besides medicinal purpose, alkyl-
functionalized 3-thiazolidines are reported to be relevant for the
ﬁelds of pesticides7 and ﬂavors8 (Fig. 1). Due to the importance of
such molecules and the lack of ef ﬁcient general synthetic
approaches, the search for attractive synthetic routes towards 3-
thiazolidines (and other pharmaceutically interesting sulfur-
containing cyclic amines such as 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzothia-
zines9) is still ongoing. The development of a general and enan-
tioselective synthetic platform technology giving access to a broad
range of such heterocycles independent of a speciﬁc substitution
pattern, thus enabling the design of libraries of such heterocycles,
as well as efﬁcient processes for their production, would be par-
ticularly desirable.
Conceptually a substitution pattern independent access
towards 3-thiazolidines 2 can be proposed to proceed through
reduction of the C=N double bond in the corresponding 3-
thiazolines (1), which can be easily prepared through Asinger-
type multicomponent reaction10– 13. However, in spite of the
availability of such attractive substrates, in all research work since
the 1950s the reduction of 3-thiazolines (1) failed by means of
nearly all state of the art-type chemical reduction technologies for
imines. Such non-successful attempts include numerous typical
C = N double bond reduction technologies, which are known to
work well for many other imine substrate types. For example, the
established hydrogenation technology (Pd/C, H2) was found at an
early stage not to be suitable due to catalyst poisoning by sul-
fur13,14. These results are in accordance with later results by the
Figueras group, ﬁnding that metals of supported metal catalysts
become poisoned by sulfur15. The recently developed organoca-
talytic reduction with Hantzsch esters for imines16,17 also failed to
lead the desired transformation due to lack of reactivity (Sup-
plementary Figs.1, 2, Supplementary Table1 and Supplementary
Methods). Other well-established reduction methods, such as
sodium in alcohol, sodium in liquid ammonia or aluminum in the
presence of potassium hydroxide or wet ether did not give clear
results13. When using metal hydrids, such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4,
reduction works but is accompanied with an undesired ring-
opening of theN,S-acetal moiety in the product2 (Supplementary
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Methods)13,14,18. The only exception is
a catecholborane-type reduction18, but in this case the yield was
low to moderate and enantioselectivity turned out to be poor with
only up to 4% enantiomeric excess (ee). In addition, a high-
catalyst loading, as well as an expensive and technically less
favored reducing agent (due to high ﬂammability) is needed.
Thus, the development of an efﬁcient general method for the
reduction of 3-thiazolines ( 1) remained a challenge, as did
establishing an asymmetric catalytic version of this reaction.
Attracted by the recent successful use of imine reductases
(IREDs) for various reductions of cyclic imines19– 30, we became
interested in studying the suitability of this biocatalytic metho-
dology for the reduction of 3-thiazolines (1) and other sulfur-
containing cyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3).
Here we report such a biocatalytic reduction which ﬁrstly
enables a smooth reduction of 3-thiazolines ( 1) avoiding
undesired ring-opening or other side reactions, secondly allows a
highly enantioselective synthesis of the resulting 3-thiazolidines
(2) by means of such an approach starting from 3-thiazolines (1),
and thirdly is a broadly applicable reduction platform for sulfur-
containing heterocyclic imines including 3-thiazolines (1), as well
as other sulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-
benzothiazines (3).
Results
Proof of concept for 3-thiazoline reduction. In initial experi-
ments, we tested whether IREDs are suitable biocatalysts for the
reduction of 3-thiazolines (Fig.2). Although unknown for cyclic
imines with additional heteroatoms, we focused on this enzyme
class instead of the so-called thiazolinyl IREDs since the latter
enzymes (although bearing the term thiazolinyl imine in their
name) are known to be substrate-speciﬁc for structurally highly
functionalized 2-thiazolines reducing an imidothioester moi-
ety
31,32, thus representing no promising option for developing a
broadly applicable synthetic platform for the reduction of the
imine bond of 3-thiazolines. Toward this end, we prepared two
non-prochiral 3-thiazolines ( 1a and 1b) and screened them
against a set of 31 IREDs, which had been prepared in a
recombinant form by means of overexpression inE. coli BL21
(DE3)22,29. As a fast screening methodology a colorimetric pH
shift assay33 developed by the Sieber group was used. This assay is
based on a pH shift (visualized by bromthymol blue), which is
caused by gluconic acid formed by consumption of the substrate
and in situ-cofactor-regeneration (Fig.3, Supplementary Figs.3, 4
and Supplementary Methods).
Color changes from green to yellow were observed for both
non-prochiral 3-thiazolines 1a and 1b in combination with a
range of IREDs (Supplementary Table 2). Negative controls
without an IRED showed no color change, indicating that the
utilized glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) has no side-activity
toward such an imine reduction (in contrast to analogous
reductions of other imines as reported in ref. 34). We
subsequently performed biotransformations at a substrate con-
centration of 20 mM of 3-thiazoline1b using two IREDs, which
were prioritized according to the results from the colorimetric pH
shift assay. For in situ-cofactor regeneration, once again a GDH
from Bacillus subtilis25,35 was used in combination withD-glucose
as a co-substrate. After a reaction time of 24 h, formation of 3-
thiazolidine 2b was demonstrated (Table1, entry 1), and revealed
conversions of 29 and 83% with perfect product selectivity even
under non-optimized reaction conditions. Thus, these results
demonstrate that IREDs are suitable biocatalysts for the reduction
of 3-thiazolines avoiding undesired ring-opening or other side
reactions known for classic chemical and chemocatalytic reduc-
tion methodologies.

Investigation of 3-thiazolines. Next, we focused on the study of
the substrate scope, as well as the determination of the enan-
tioselectivity of these IRED-catalyzed reduction of 3-thiazolines.
Toward this end, we prepared a range of prochiral 3-thiazolines
1c– 1f, comprising monocyclic andspiro-type compounds (Fig.3b
and Table 1). Based on the results of the colorimetric pH shift
assay for these 3-thiazolines (Supplementary Fig.4 and Supple-
mentary Table 2), the speci ﬁc activities were determined by
means of a spectrophotometric study, and it is noteworthy that
activities were found for all studied 3-thiazolines (Supplementary
Figs. 5, 6 and Supplementary Table3). Utilizing the IREDs which
showed the highest speciﬁc activities, biotransformations of the
prochiral 3-thiazolines running at a 20 mM substrate concentra-
tion on a 10 mL scale and in situ-cofactor regeneration with a
GDH were performed (Table 1, entry 2– 5). We found that for
each substrate at least one IRED catalyzes the reduction with
good to excellent conversion (82 – 98%) under non-optimized
reaction conditions (Table 1). Activity was higher when R 3
comprises methyl groups as substituents compared to the steri-
cally less hindered hydrogen. Thus, when starting from prochiral
3-thiazolines 1c and 1e, which bear hydrogens at R3, a higher
total protein concentration of 5 mg mL−1 had to be used for
achieving good conversions (Table1, entry 2, 4). In contrast, for
good to excellent conversions a much lower amount of IRED822
with a total protein concentration (crude extract) of 1.2 mg mL−1
was sufﬁcient when utilizing prochiral 3-thiazolines 1d and 1f
(Table 1, entry 3, 5). Moreover, a higher activity of IRED822 as
well as conversion was found when using spiro-cyclic 3-
thiazolidine 1e and 1f compared to the analogous 3-
thiazolidines bearing methyl groups as substituents R2, 1c and
1d. The highest activity of all tested 3-thiazolines could be
determined with the spiro-cyclic compound 1f, which supports
our observation that methyl groups at R3, as well as aspiro-cyclic
scaffold as R2 substituents represent the best substitution pattern
for reduction of 3-thiazolines using IREDs. Negative controls of
biotransformations of 3-thiazolines without IRED again showed
no conversion, indicating that the utilized GDH has no side-
activity towards this imine reduction. Furthermore, we found that
IREDs catalyze the reduction of prochiral 3-thiazolines 1c– 1f
with high to excellent enantioselectivities (96– 99% ee) indepen-
dent of the substituents R2 and R3 (Table 1, entry 2– 5), thus
representing the ﬁrst access to 3-thiazolidines with high-
enantiomeric excess via reduction of the C= N double bond in
3-thiazolines (1). The absolute conﬁguration of the predominant
formation of the enantiomers of 3-thiazolidines turned out to beS

Table 1), which is in accordance with the previously reported
selectivity of the imine reducases IRED8 and IRED2422,29. The
opportunity to reduce monocyclic, as well as spiro-cyclic 3-
thiazolines with high conversion and enantioselectivity underlines
the value of this biocatalytic approach. Spiro-cyclic scaffolds
represent important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry36,37
so that in the future this methodology could be useful toward
drug discovery by constructing libraries with structurally highly
diverse sulfur-containing spiro-heterocyclic amines.
Determination of the absolute conﬁguration of 2f. Due to the
lack of availability of enantiomerically pure reference compounds
(indicating the dif ﬁculty to access them by other synthetic
methods), we decided to determine the absolute conﬁguration of
2f (obtained from the experiment at elevated lab scale as
described in section Process development on 3-thiazoline
reduction) by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectro-
scopy. The experimental IR and VCD spectra of2f were recorded
in choloroform and are shown in Fig.4a (for details, see Supple-
mentary Methods). In order to simulate the spectra for the
assignment of the conﬁguration, a conformational analysis was
carried out ﬁrst for (S)-2f at the MMFF level of theory using
Spartan 14 software (Spartan 14, Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA,
USA (2014)). Subsequently, all eight obtained conformers were
subjected to further geometry optimizations followed by spectra
calculations at the B3LYP/6-311g ++ (2d,p)/IEFPCM(CHCl3)
level of theory (using the software Gaussian 09 Rev. E01, Frisch,
M.J. et al. Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford CT, USA, (2013)). The
relative Gibbs free energies ΔG298 K and the corresponding
Boltzmann weights of the two populated conformers are shown in
Fig. 4b. Based on the single-conformer spectra, the IR and VCD
spectra were simulated by assigning a Lorentzian band shape to
the dipole and rotational strength calculated for each conformer
and subsequent Boltzmann-averaging of the spectra. Direct
comparison of the resulting simulated IR and VCD spectra with
the experimental data, as indicated by the assignments given in
Fig. 4a, reveals a very good agreement. Therefore, the absolute
conﬁguration can be assigned with very high conﬁdence as (S)-2f.
Reduction of 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Afterwards we studied
further reductions using other sulfur-containing heterocyclic
imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) as substrates (Fig.5),
which have already been chemocatalytically reduced in an
asymmetric fashion16,17,38. Therefore, the2H-1,4-benzothiazines
3a– 3c were prepared. Among these compounds, the prochiral
representatives 3b and 3c contain either a methyl or phenyl group
as substituents at R (Table2). Again the colorimetric pH shift

enzyme activities were conducted and the most promising IREDs
prioritized (Supplementary Figs. 3, 5, 7 and Supplementary
Tables 2, 3). It turned out that the speciﬁc activity for 2H-1,4-
benzothiazines 3a and 3b were about 10-fold higher compared to
those for 3-thiazoline1f, which showed the highest activity of all
tested 3-thiazolines. Moreover, the speciﬁc activities for prochiral
2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c, bearing a phenyl as substituent at the
prochiral carbon atom, is also about 10-fold higher compared to
the 3-thiazolines 1a-e (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7 and Supple-
mentary Table 3). Based on these encouraging enzyme activities,
showing high activity for 2H-1,4-benzothiazines also with steri-
cally demanding substituents, as a next step synthetic bio-
transformations were carried out which also enabled us to gain
insight into the enantioselectivity of such reactions (Table 2).
These biocatalytic reductions were conducted at substrate con-
centrations of 20 mM on a 0.5 mL scale and the cofactor NADPH
was recycled in situ by means of a GDH andD-glucose (Fig. 5).
Under non-optimized reaction conditions all 2H-1,4-ben-
zothiazines were converted to the corresponding 3,4-dihydro-
2H-1,4-benzothiazines with moderate to good conversions of up
to >99%, and most IREDs turned out to be suitable for catalyzing
these reactions. In accordance with the determined enzyme
activities, the amount of biocatalyst needed for the reduction of
2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c, comprising a phenyl group at R, was
higher compared to the one for 2H-1,4-benzothiazines with a
methyl group or a hydrogen atom at R (Table 2, entry 1– 3).
Negative controls of biotransformations of2H-1,4-benzothiazines
without IRED again showed no conversion, indicating that the
utilized GDH has no side-activity toward this imine reduction.
Furthermore, we found that IREDs catalyze the reduction of2H-
1,4-benzothiazines with high to excellent enantioselectivities
(83– 99% ee), and provided an access to both enantiomers of
the 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzothiazines with high enantiomeric
excess (Table2, entry 2– 3). Moreover, a higher enantioselectivity
was observed for the more sterically demanding substrate 3c,
comprising a phenyl group at R (with 99% ee), compared to the
2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3b, comprising a methyl group at R (with
up to 99% ee). The imine reductases IRED5, IRED28 and
IRED2922,29 were identiﬁed as most suitable enzymes for the
reduction of 2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c bearing a phenyl group at
R. Notably, in addition to all tested 3-thiazolines IRED822 turned
out to be able to catalyze also the reduction of 2H-1,4-
benzothiazines 3a and 3c, thus representing an IRED being able
to accept nearly all of the examined sulfur-containing heterocyclic
imines.
DFT studies. Taking into account the different activities of
IREDs for 3-thiazolines (1) and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) with
higher ones for the latter molecules, it is noteworthy that the
(same) tendency is also observed for organocatalysts (being able
to reduce 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) but not 3-thiazolines (1)
(Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Methods)). In addi-
tion, these ﬁndings are in accordance with observations of the
Turner group, who found higher activities for six-membered
rings compared to ﬁve-membered rings when examining the
biocatalytic reduction of cyclic imines20,23. Therefore, we were
interested in rationalizing this phenomena. Interestingly, both
reduction methods are based on dihydropyridine moieties as
reducing agents, namely the cofactor NADPH + H+ and a

Hantzsch ester, respectively. Therefore, we performed orientating
DFT studies (B3LYP 6-311+ G**; for further details, see Supple-
mentary Methods) with a dihydropyridine mimic in combination
with a structurally minimized 3-thiazoline and 2H-1,4-ben-
zothiazine, both of which were N-protonated. The barriers of
activation associated with the transition states are 23 kcal/mol for
the former (Fig.6a) and 19 kcal/mol for the latter (Fig.6b). Even
though these gas-phase calculations are based on simpli ﬁed
(protonated) model systems, the higher barrier for the reduction
of 3-thiazolines compared to the one for2H-1,4-benzothiazines is
in good agreement with the lower activities found for imine
reductases, as well as with the lack of reactivity for organocata-
lysts when reducing 3-thiazolines. This trend was also conﬁrmed
by calculations with the SMD intrinsic solvation model, as similar
differences in the free energies of activation were obtained with
parameters for water (17 kcal/mol vs. 13 kcal/mol) and chloro-
form (20 kcal/mol vs. 15 kcal/mol).

Process development on 3-thiazoline reduction. The positive
results concerning IRED-catalyzed reduction of sulfur-containing
heterocyclic imines motivated us to start a process development
exempliﬁed by the enantioselective reduction of 3-thiazoline1f by
means of IRED822 (Fig. 7a). Towards this end, in an analogy to
our previous work25,35 an E. coli whole-cell catalyst was designed,
overexpressing the prioritized IRED8 and a glucose dehy-
drogenase from Bacillus subtilis for in situ-cofactor recycling.
Both genes, encoding for IRED and GDH, respectively, have been
inserted on different plasmids (Fig. 7b). Preparative scale
experiments (40 mL) were performed with a substrate con-
centration of 100 mM and a lyophilized whole-cell catalyst using
a Titrino apparatus to adjust the pH at 7 (Fig.7c). We found that
the reaction proceed smoothly also on preparative scale giving a
very high conversion (99%) and enantioselectivity (99% ee
for the S-enantiomer) within 30 h reaction time. After work up
the desired 3-thiazolidine ( S)-2f was isolated in 78% yield
(Fig. 7a).
In summary, we reported a methodology which enables a
reduction of 3-thiazolines under formation of the resulting 3-
thiazolidines with high conversion and enantioselectivity of at
least 96% ee and up to 99% ee, avoiding undesired ring-opening
or other side reactions. This process technology, which is based
on the use of IREDs as catalysts, has a broad substrate range and
was also applied successfully to other sulfur-containing hetero-
cyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Furthermore, the
trends for the reduction of different substrates could be
rationalized by molecular modeling and an initial process
development was also conducted, demonstrating the suitability
of this method for preparative use. In future work, the focus will
be on rationalizing the enzymatic reaction course and the
enantioselectivity of this process by means of molecular
modeling.
Methods
Biotransformations of 3-thiazolines. Biotransformations of 3-thiazolines (which
were synthesized as described in Supplementary Methods; related NMR data are
shown in Supplementary Figs.40– 55) were performed on 10 mL scale at 30 °C and
500 r.p.m. in 100 mM KPi buffer pH 7, with 2% methanol as cosolvent containing
40 mMD-glucose, 20 mM 3-thiazoline1a–f, 1.2 mg mL−1 (in case of substrate1d
and 1f and IRED8) or 5 mg mL−1 IRED crude extract (in the other cases shown in
Table 1, see Supplementary Table4, Supplementary Methods for codon-optimized
gene sequences, protein sequences, Supplementary Figs.8– 38 for plasmid structures
and Supplementary Fig.39 for SDS-Page), 24 U (in case of 1.2 mg mL−1 IRED) or
100 U of GDH (in the other cases shown in Table1) and 0.1 mM NADP+. After
24 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 µL of 32% NaOH solution and 10 mL
of dichloromethane. Phase separation was promoted by centrifugation and the
conversion was determined by analyzing the organic phase by means of achiral GC
(Supplementary Figs.56– 60, Supplementary Table5 and Supplementary Methods;
synthesis of racemic 3-thiazolidine reference compounds is described in Supple-
mentary Methods and related NMR data are shown in Supplementary Figs.61– 70).
For determination of the enantiomeric excess, samples were derivatized according
to General Procedure 5 in the Supplementary Methods (NMR data of derivatized
references are shown in Supplementary Figs.71– 78) and then analyzed by SFC-
HPLC (Supplementary Figs.79– 82, Supplementary Table6 and Supplementary
Methods). The results of these experiments are shown in Table1, details about
performing of negative controls are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The
biotransformation on preparative scale (40 mL) using a whole-cell catalyst was
performed in a similar fashion and is described in detail in Supplementary
Methods.
1H and13C NMR spectra of (S)-2f are shown in Supplementary Figs.83
and 84.
Biotransformations of 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Biotransformations of2H-1,4-
benzothiazines (which were synthesized as described in Supplementary Methods;
related NMR data are shown in Supplementary Figs.40– 43 and 85– 92) were
performed in a similar fashion as the biotransformations of 3-thiazolines. The
conversion was determined by analyzing the organic phase by SFC-HPLC
