Abstract 
Background: Escherichia coli have both the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway (EMPP) and Entner–Doudoroff path-
way (EDP) for glucose breakdown, while the EDP primarily remains inactive for glucose metabolism. However, EDP is a 
more favorable route than EMPP for the production of certain products.
Results: EDP was activated by deleting the pfkAB genes in conjunction with subsequent adaptive laboratory evolu-
tion (ALE). The evolved strains acquired mutations in transcriptional regulatory genes for glycolytic process (crp, galR, 
and gntR) and in glycolysis-related genes (gnd, ptsG, and talB). The genotypic, transcriptomic and phenotypic analy-
ses of those mutations deepen our understanding of their beneficial effects on cellulosic biomass bio-conversion. 
On top of these scientific understandings, we further engineered the strain to produce higher level of lycopene and 
3-hydroxypropionic acid.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the E. coli strain has innate capability to use EDP in lieu of EMPP for glucose 
metabolism, and this versatility can be harnessed to further engineer E. coli for specific biotechnological applications.

Background
Bacterial glucose metabolism is particularly diverse 
and involves the orchestrated actions of multiple path -
ways, including the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas path -
way (EMPP), Entner–Doudoroff pathway (EDP), pentose 
phosphate pathway (PPP), and oxidative pathway (via 
gluconic acid) [1, 2]. These pathways produce pyruvate, 
reducing power (NADH and/or NADPH), and energy 
(ATP), and play a central role in growth and bio-produc -
tion [3, 4]. In contrast to Escherichia coli, which primar -
ily uses the EMPP for glucose metabolism, Pseudomonas, 
and Zymomonas spp. employ the EDP , as they lack phos-
phofructokinase (Pfk), a pivotal EMPP enzyme. The PPP 
is a metabolic pathway that functions in parallel with 
either the EMPP or EDP and supplies the energy require -
ments for cell growth, NADPH regeneration, and replen -
ishment of essential precursors for nucleotide and amino 
acid synthesis.
The EMPP comprises 10 enzymatic steps, yielding 
two pyruvate, two net ATP , and two NADH molecules 
per one glucose molecule, whereas the EDP utilizes 
only five enzymes to have two pyruvates (one of which 
is produced from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) 
via the lower glycolysis), one net ATP , one NADH, 
and one NADPH molecule per one glucose molecule. 
The EDP has been reported to have certain advantages 
compared with the EMPP [5 ]. For example, it is the 
thermodynamically more favorable pathway, owing to 
lower ATP production, in turn, boosting glycolysis [6 ].

Considering the number of enzymatic steps involved, 
the costs of protein synthesis in EDP is lower than 
that of EMPP [7 ]. It is also characterized by less allos -
teric regulation due to the lack of Pfk catalysis, one of 
the committed steps in the EMPP , which is found to 
be subjected to intensive regulation at the transcrip -
tion, translation, and even post-translation and allos -
teric levels via distal metabolites, as well as energetic 
precursors [8 ]. The EDP is also associated with higher 
NADPH production to provide high reducing power 
for biosynthesis, resistance to oxidative stress, and the 
optimal synthesis of both the carbon and redox precur -
sors for terpenoid biosynthesis. For example, Z . mobilis 
that relies extensively on the EDP shows notably rapid 
glucose uptake and ethanol production rates [9 ], and 
Pseudomonas species that utilizes an incomplete EMPP 
shows high production of highly toxic chemicals asso -
ciated with their innate high solvent tolerance. Besides, 
the absence of a Pfk step facilitates the cyclization of 
PPP , which regenerates excess NADPH [10, 11].
Nevertheless, although there are several distinct ben -
efits of employing EDP , the industrial strains of E. coli 
do not use their inherent EDP for glucose metabolism. 
Several studies have been conducted to engineer E. coli 
in an effort to activate the intrinsic EDP and to block the 
EMPP to promote more efficient biosynthesis. Previously, 
blockage of the EMPP via deletion of the phosphoglucose 
isomerase gene (pgi) resulted in re-routing the glycolytic 
flux through the PPP and EDP . The Δpgi recombinant E. 
coli strains were characterized with enhanced production 
of polyhydroxybutyrate [12], isoprenoid [13], and hydro -
gen [14]. However, although the Δpgi mutants remain 
viable, given that the glycolytic flux is re-routed through 
the PPP and EDP , excess NADPH production was found 
to perturb a significant portion of the metabolic net -
work, resulting in an approximately 80% reduction in 
cell growth in glucose minimal media when compared 
with the wild-type levels [15]. Disrupting the EMPP by 
knocking out the phosphofructokinase I (PfkA) gene also 
resulted in re-routing the glycolytic flux through the PPP 
(~ 60% of the glycolytic flux) and the native EDP (~ 14% 
of glycolytic flux) [16]. The ΔpfkA recombinant E. coli 
strains showed enhanced production of 1,3-diaminopro -
pane [17], hydrogen and ethanol [18], lycopene [19], and 
methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate [20]. However, these strains 
showed a more significant decrease in growth rate com -
pared with the Δpgi mutants owing to the partial cycliza -
tion of PPP , which may produce excess NADPH [21]. E. 
coli in which the EMPP was completely blocked by delet -
ing pfkAB showed retarded growth on glucose minimal 
medium due to redox imbalance and reduced glucose 
uptake, suggesting the PPP and EDP were not sufficiently 
activated to alleviate the metabolic defect.
In this study, we isolated and characterized a pfkAB-
deleted E. coli mutant strains that can thrive on glucose 
minimal medium with adaptive laboratory evolution 
(ALE). Using these strains, we investigated the geno -
type–phenotype relationship to determine and classify 
the requirements for the full activation of the EDP in E. 
coli. Finally, as a proof of concept and based on the pre -
liminary information obtained, we further engineered the 
evolved mutant to confer it with the ability to produce 
a higher level of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) that 
requires more NADPH regeneration.
Results and discussion
Adaptive evolution of the ∆pfkAB strain and analysis 
of mutations identified in the evolved strains
Given that E. coli has two Pfk isozymes, Pfk-I and Pfk-
II encoded by pfkA and pfkB, respectively [22], a recom -
binant E. coli strain with complete inactivation of the 
EMPP was constructed by deleting both of pfkA and 
pfkB genes. The ∆pfkAB strain showed slower specific 
growth rate on minimal medium containing glucose as a 
sole carbon source (Fig.  1a). ALE experiments were per -
formed to recover the reduced cell growth by activating 
the EDP . After 50 subcultures of the ∆pfkAB strain in M9 
minimal medium supplemented with 5  g/L glucose, the 
strain thereafter grew more rapidly on glucose. The five 
evolved ∆pfkAB strains showing recovered cell growth 
were isolated and denoted as pfk_ALE-1, -2, -3, -4, and 
-5 strains (Additional file  1: Figure S1a). The ALE-1 
exhibited 92% of cell mass accumulation of the wild-type 
MG1655 strain after culturing for 20 h. This is the first E. 
coli strain with a completely inactivated EMPP that can 
grow more rapidly than mutants with partial blockage of 
the EMPP , such as the ∆pfkA and ∆pgi mutants (Fig. 1a). 
Besides, the ALE-1 strain showed improved terpenoid 
biosynthesis via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, 
which has been observed in EDP-activated E. coli strains, 
because the synthetic pathway starts with 1-deoxy-d-
xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase reaction with the 
two substrates G3P and pyruvate that are the final prod -
ucts of EDP . In addition, the synthetic pathway uses 
NADPH as sources of reducing regent produced by EDP . 
Interestingly, the production culture conditions used in 
the present study were able to rescue cell growth of the 
ALE-1 strain, with a 115% higher cell mass accumulation 
than the wild type at 36 h of culturing (Additional file  1: 
Figure S2).
We sequenced the whole genome of ALE-1 and com -
pared the sequence with the parental strain, E . coli 
MG1655. Resequencing identified six mutations in 
ALE-1 (Table  1). To confirm enriched and major muta -
tions during ALE, the mutations detected in the ALE-1 
were analyzed in the rest of four evolved mutants

Fig. 1 Comparison of cell growth on glucose among EMPP-disrupted strains and the effect of mutations on cell growth of the evolved strains 
and their background strains. a Growth rate profiles  (OD600) were compared for three groups of E. coli strains: wild type with MG1655, complete 
disruption of EMPP with background strain (∆pfkAB), and evolved strain (ALE-1), and partial disruption of EMPP with the phosphofructokinase I 
step (∆pfkA) and phosphoglucose isomerase step (∆pgi). Error bars indicate standard deviations of measurements for three independent biological 
replicates. b Genetic characterization of five independent evolved ∆pfkAB isolate strains with genome resequencing analysis. The number of 
unique mutations per gene is noted within brackets. c The effect of mutations on cell growth were determined by introducing single or multiple 
mutations in the background strain ∆pfkAB. For the mutation in ptsG, the IS5 insertion disrupted the protein, and consequently, PtsG would lose 
its functionality. Thus, we knocked out the ptsG gene instead of knocking-in the IS element. Error bars indicate standard deviations of growth 
measurements for three independent biological replicates

by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Muta -
tions were found in the gntR, galR, ptsG, and ugd-gnd-
wbbL-2 sequences of all five pfk_ALE strains, whereas 
mutations in the talB  and crp genes were detected only 
in one or two strains (Fig.  1b). Notably, galR  showed 
three unique mutations during adaptive evolution, but 
all resulted in truncated and non-functional protein 
(Additional file  1: Figure S1b, c). This suggests that the 
galR mutation could be critical for the growth of the 
evolved strain. In contrast, mutation in the talB  gene 
was only observed in the ALE-1 strain and crp muta -
tion was detected in the ALE-1 and ALE-4 strains, 
probably indicating that these mutations might not 
considerably affect the physiological background dur -
ing ALE [23– 25].
To compare the effects of the above mutations on 
the growth of ALE-1 strain, single mutations or com -
binations of the multiple mutations were introduced 
into the background ΔpfkAB strain. The growth rates 
of the resulting strains were compared with that of the 
background and evolved strain. The single mutation in 
the gntR, galR, crp caused an increase in the specific 
growth rate of 1.2-fold, 1.1-fold, and 1.2-fold, respec -
tively, relative to the background ΔpfkAB strain. The 
single mutation in talB and the ptsG deletion mutant of 
the background strain showed a slight decrease in the 
specific growth rate. The background strain carrying a 
deletion of the ugd-gnd-wbbL-2 region showed an even 
slower cell growth. When each of the six mutations was 
introduced independently, the restored cell growth lev -
els of the resulting mutants were considerably lower 
than that of the evolved strain. Eventually, when the 
mutant was harboring all six mutations, the growth 
rate was comparable to ALE-1 (Fig.  1c). Based on these 
observations, we deduced that the enhanced growth 
differentiating ALE-1 from the background mutant was 
attributed not only to the occurrence of a single muta -
tion in gntR, galR, ugd-gnd-wbbL-2, ptsG, crp, and talB , 
but also to their synergistic interaction.
GntR is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that 
represses the expression of genes involved in gluco -
nate metabolism in the absence of the effector molecule 
D-gluconate [26]. Gluconate is phosphorylated by gluco -
nate kinase to produce 6PG, which is also produced from 
glucose. It is finally metabolized to G3P and pyruvate via 
the 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (Edd) and 2-keto-
3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (Eda) enzymes of 
EDP . Knockout of gntR has previously revealed that the 
expression of edd and eda  genes can occur even in the 
absence of gluconate [27]. Therefore, we hypothesized 
that the loss-of-function mutation in the gntR gene de-
represses the originally latent genes of the EDP , thereby 
providing a major route for glucose metabolism in ALE-1 
with an inactive EMPP (ΔpfkAB) and an inactive oxida -
tive PPP (Δgnd) (Table 1) [28]. In fact, ALE-1 Δedd strain 
could not grow on glucose, indicating that ALE-1 relies 
on the EDP on glucose as the sole carbon source (Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S3).
GalR is a transcriptional regulator that down-regulates 
the genes associated with galactose metabolism when 
this sugar is unavailable [29]. The regulon of GalR har -
bors the galP  gene encoding galactose permease, which 
also has glucose uptake activity [30]. Wild type E. coli 
mainly takes up external glucose by a phosphoenolpyru -
vate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), which 
consists of enzyme I (PtsI), HPr (PtsH), and glucose-
specific PTS EIIA (Crr) and EIICB (PtsG) components 
[31]. Thus, we anticipated that the evolved mutant that 
lost the PTS activity due to PtsG inactivation by inser -
tion of the IS5 and SgrS regulation of sugar transporter 
mRNAs (ptsG and manXYZ) due to the accumulation of 
glucose-6-phosphate, and consequently, the strain can

co-metabolize glucose and xylose, which was the case in 
the ptsG-deleted E. coli strains (Additional file  1: Figure 
S7d–f) [32–34]. It has also been reported that the loss of 
PtsG function results in retarded cell growth due to the 
limited capacity of glucose import, and non-PTS glucose 
transporters such as GalP can restore the glucose uptake 
rate in ptsG null mutants [35, 36]. Based on this assump -
tion, we hypothesized that the expressed GalP , which is 
depressed by the inactivation of galR,  rescues the glucose 
uptake capacity of ALE-1.
Moreover, another possible reason for the expression 
of a non-PTS glucose permease GalP in EMPP-disrupted 
strains could be the low availability of phosphoenolpyru -
vate (PEP), which is essential for the PTS-dependent 
glucose uptake. Previous studies showed that the ∆pfkA 
mutant had reduced PEP concentration [15]. Besides, an 
increase in flux through the EDP can further lower the 
intracellular PEP pool [16]. It is supported by the stoi -
chiometry of the EDP , where PEP generation per glucose 
is half of that of the PPP or EMPP [13]. Limited glucose 
importing capacity due to low PEP availability can be 
supplemented by the expression of PEP-independent glu-
cose permease and glucokinase [35].
cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global transcrip -
tion regulator that directly or indirectly regulates the 
expression of over 100 genes [37–39]. The mutation 
site of  CRPA85S was very close to the cAMP binding 
site, suggesting the possible effect on the binding affin -
ity. However, most of cAMP-independent CRP mutants 
contained mutations away from the binding site such as 
I112, T127, and A144 residues [40]. Therefore, it is hard 
to establish that the  CRPA85S is a cAMP-independent 
mutant. Since no significant difference in the cell growth 
was observed by this mutation, the activity of this enzyme 
was not affected (Fig.  1c). However, the exact mecha -
nism underlying the crp mutation-mediated growth rate 
enhancement in the evolved strain remains unclear. We 
discovered that crp mutation occurred in the later period 
of adaptation (during 30–50 repeats of culture) while 
ptsG mutation was detected in the earlier period of adap -
tation (during 0–30 repeats of culture). Although PTS 
inactivation by ptsG mutation is an efficient way to trig -
ger carbon catabolite repression (CCR) release like galP  
expression, the modification of binding between CRP 
and cAMP might further contribute the release of CCR 
and provide a strong selective pressure during adaptation 
[41].
TalB is an enzyme involved in the non-oxidative PPP 
and provides a reversible reaction between the PPP and 
the upper EMPP [42]. The A247 residue is located in an 
α-helix and away from the active center of E. coli TalB. 
The B-factor value of the mutated residue was kept 
considerably lower, indicating that the mutation stably 
maintains its α-helix structure. In addition, the substrate 
binding affinity of the  TalBA247T in E. coli W3110 strain 
was not modified in a previous study [43]. Moreover, the 
expression level of the talB gene in ALE-1 was not signifi-
cantly changed (1.3-fold) by this mutation compared to 
that in MG1655 (Additional file  1: Figure S5). Since the 
ALE-1 strain lacks the gnd gene, a change in the non-oxi -
dative PPP flux might be directed by a genetic mutation 
in talB during adaptation to supply precursors essential 
for growth.
Functional analysis of the genetic mutations 
with transcriptomic and phenotypic data
Functional analysis of the mutations detected in the 
ALE-1 strain was conducted to elucidate the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the effects of these mutations. 
We performed transcriptome analysis with RNA-seq 
to investigate the transcriptomic effects of mutations 
involved in the glycolytic pathway and global transcrip -
tional regulation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the 
expression levels of 4497 genes on the chromosome of 
MG1655 and ALE-1 strains. Among those genes, we first 
focused on the glycolytic pathways including the EMPP , 
EDP and PPP . Complete deletion of the pfkA gene was 
confirmed with no pfkA expression. In ALE-1, the expres-
sion of the edd and eda  genes, which are involved in the 
EDP , were 11.2- and 5.1-fold higher than in MG1655, 
respectively. This indicates that the latent EDP was acti -
vated during adaptation due to loss of function for GntR. 
Additionally, the expression level of the GntR regulon in 
ALE-1 was higher compared to MG1655. There was no 
expression of gnd, involved in the oxidative PPP , due to 
its complete deletion in ALE-1 (Fig.  2a). Taking these 
observations into consideration, the ALE-1 strain utilizes 
glucose via the EDP rather than the EMPP and oxidative 
PPP since ALE-1 lacks functional PfkA, PfkB, GntR, and 
Gnd. The RNA-seq analysis also showed lower expres -
sion level of ptsG in ALE-1 compared to MG1655, caused 
by degradation of ptsG mRNA. Instead, the expression 
level of the non-PTS glucose transporter, galP , in ALE-1 
was 13.7-fold higher than MG1655. This phenomenon 
was also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrat-
ing 7.6-fold increased expression level (Additional file  1: 
Figure S5). Notably, we found that the expression lev -
els of the galR  regulon in ALE-1 was higher than that in 
MG1655 due to the inactivation of GalR (Fig.  2a). These 
indicate that the limited glucose uptake capacity was res -
cued by the GalP via the inactivation of GalR. However, 
only a small change was observed in the gntR and galR  
expression level between the MG1655 and ALE-1 strains, 
which suggests that the transcriptional levels of gntR and 
galR were not affected by the genetic mutation. Instead, 
mutations in gntR and galR might result in loss of protein 
Page 6 of 16Kim et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2022) 15:120 
function since the expression levels of their regulon were 
down-regulated. During evolution, ALE-1 activated the 
latent pathways, including the glyoxylate shunt and phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) reaction. Since 
the glyoxylate shunt does not regenerate NADPH unlike 
the isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd) reaction, the evolved 
strain might enhance the glyoxylate shunt flux rather 
than the Icd reaction to reduce the NADPH regeneration 
capacity. Overall, transcriptome analysis suggested that 
the glycolytic flux was re-routed through the activation of 
latent pathways and rescued the glucose uptake capacity 
in ALE-1. On the other hand, even though glucose can 
be utilized via mannose PTS [41], the expression levels 
of manX, manY, and manZ in ALE-1 were 2.9-, 2.0-, and 
1.5-fold reduced compared to those in MG1655, respec -
tively (Fig. 2a).
To further confirm our hypotheses, we initially deleted 
the gntR, galR, and ptsG genes in the ALE-1 strain. We 
found that the deletion of either the gntR, galR or ptsG 
gene did not affect the growth of ALE-1 cells, whereas 
restoration of these mutations resulted in notable adverse 
effects on the growth of ALE-1 cells (Fig.  2b). These 
results imply that GntR and GalR mutants may be unable 
to repress the expression of their target genes, includ -
ing edd, eda, and galP. As expected, the same phenotype 
was observed in the ALE-1 strain that had a transposon 
inserted in ptsG or had a deleted ptsG mutation, con -
firming that the ptsG gene with the IS insertion lost its 
activity. To verify the target genes of the two TFs, we 
expressed the plasmid-encoded endogenous edd-eda  or 
galP gene in the gntR- and galR -restored ALE-1, respec -
tively, resulting in increased growth from 36 and 55% up 
to 82% and 86% of ALE-1, respectively. These observa -
tions thus indicate that the plasmid-based expression 
of edd-eda and galP  genes can functionally recover cell 
growth defects caused by the restored active GntR and 
GalR in ALE-1 (Fig.  2b and Additional file  1: Figure S4a). 
To verify the effect of the large deletion of the ugd-gnd-
wbbL-2 region carrying the two functional genes ugd  and 
gnd on ALE-1 cell growth, we re-introduced the deleted 
region into the chromosome of ALE-1. The restored 
strain showed reduced cell growth, and then the dele -
tion of the gnd gene, but not the ugd  gene, resulted in a 
substantial recovery of the growth defect caused by the 
restoration of the ugd-gnd-wbbL-2 region (Fig.  2b and 
Additional file 1: Figure 4a).
According to the transcriptome analysis, we hypoth -
esized that the ALE-1 uses EDP instead of the EMPP 
or oxidative PPP as the major glycolytic pathway. Since 
2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) is an 
intermediate of EDP , intracellular KDPG level should be 
higher in ALE-1 compared to its wild-type strain. It was 
previously reported that the transcription of hexR, that 
originated from P. putida KT2440, was repressed in the 
presence of KDPG produced from glucose or gluconate 
[44]. To analyze the EDP flux, a KDPG-responsible bio -
sensor using a transcriptional regulator (HexR) and GFP 
was constructed to sense the intracellular level of KDPG. 
Using an appropriate gate, M1, 85.8% of the popula -
tion of ALE-1 and 9.5% of the wild-type MG1655 were 
detected (Fig.  2c). Previously, the glycolytic pathway of 
Δpgi ΔgntR double-knockout E. coli strain was redirected 
from EMPP to EDP [28]. In fact, 64.2% of the population 
of the Δpgi ΔgntR double-knockout cells were detected 
with M1 gate, which was higher than wild-type strain. 
This KDPG-responsible biosensor successfully supported 
our hypothesis that the EDP of ALE-1 was more active 
than that of the wild-type.
In conclusion, the growth of the EMPP-deficient 
mutant was facilitated by a number of factors that 
includes, 1) the re-direction of the glucose flux from the 
oxidative PPP to EDP by the deletion of gnd, 2) the gain 
of the EDP activity by the lack of gntR, and 3) the recov -
ery of glucose uptake by the inactivation of GalR (Fig.  2d 
and Additional file 1: Figure S4b).
Prioritization between the EDP and PPP for optimal cell 
growth
Notably, the evolved strain had the gnd mutation result -
ing in the inactivation of oxidative PPP , an alternative 
glycolytic pathway. The ALE-1 strain thus employs only 
the EDP for glycolysis, indicating that an active PPP 
might harm the growth of bacterial cells using the EDP 
as the main glycolytic pathway. The availability of the 
ALE-1 strain with plasmid-based Gnd expression ena -
bled us to assess the effect of glucose catabolism via both

oxidative PPP and EDP on its cell growth (Fig.  3a, b). As 
expected, expression of Gnd conferring oxidative PPP 
activity together with the EDP had an adverse effect on 
the growth of ALE-1 cells, leading to a 23% decrease in 
the growth rate of the evolved strain. We further inves -
tigated the effect of the further increased glycolytic flux 
from the EDP to oxidative PPP on the growth of ALE-1 
cells by expressing both gnd and gntR on a plasmid, 
where Gnd reactivates oxidative PPP and GntR represses 
the EDP (Fig.  3a, c). As a result, high glycolytic flux to 
oxidative PPP resulted in more severe growth defects, 
resulting in a 39% reduction in cell growth, but exhibiting 
a 120% higher NADPH/NADP + ratio (Fig.  3d, e). Using 
HexR-based KDPG-responsible biosensor, we further 
examined the activity of EDP in ALE-1 with plasmid-
based expression of the gnd and/or gntR genes to confirm 
that expression of those genes led to redirect glycolytic 
flux. As a result, the concentration of intracellular KDPG 
was decreased when only gnd was expressed and further 
decreased when both the gnd and gntR were expressed 
(Additional file  1: Figure S6). This observation led us to 
speculate about why the oxidative PPP function was lost 
instead of being conserved to handle the glycolytic flux 
together with the EDP . It has been suggested that one of 
the reasons why the E. coli Δpgi mutant, which is primar-
ily dependent on the PPP for glucose catabolism, shows 
reduced glucose uptake rate is due to a redox imbalance 
and/or an excess of NADPH regenerated from the PPP 
[45]. When glucose is metabolized via the EDP , one less 
NADPH is regenerated than via the PPP in this mutant 
[46]. However, the PPP of the pfkAB knockout mutant 
can regenerate excess NADPH even more intensively due

to its cyclized architecture compared with the pgi-null 
mutant [10]. Taking these observations into considera -
tion, the effect of re-routing the glycolytic flux to the EDP 
on the reduction of the regeneration of NADPH would 
be more significant in the latter mutant. Despite partial 
relief afforded by the EDP , the NADPH formed via the 
cyclized PPP might exceed the demand for cell growth.
Moreover, the EDP has been known to be thermody -
namically favorable, even when compared with the native 
glycolytic route EMPP . This thermodynamically favora -
ble property enables the EDP to sustain a glycolytic flux 
comparable to that of the EMPP [6, 7]. Indeed, Z. mobilis, 
which extensively employs the EDP for glycolysis, takes 
up glucose at a notably rapid rate [9]. This observation 
indicates that the capacity and turnover rate of the EDP 
would be substantial [47, 48]. Considering the foregoing 
observations, establishing the EDP as the sole glycolytic 
route, rather than sharing the flux with the PPP , would 
benefit the growth of the Pfk-deficient mutant in terms 
of both reducing NADPH production and expanding 
glycolytic capacity during selection. Consistent with this 
hypothesis, the soil bacterium P. putida KT2440, which 
lacks a functional EMPP , is known to be almost exten -
sively dependent on the EDP for glycolysis, with less than 
10% of the glucose flux entering the PPP [2].
Dynamic regulation of the EDP and PPP 
for biotechnological applications
To facilitate optimal growth, cells must stringently bal -
ance their intracellular redox. However, the microbial 
production of value-added chemicals often requires 
an abundant supply of reducing powers in the form of 
NADPH. Accordingly, there exists a fundamental differ -
ence in the optimal architecture of the core metabolic 
pathways to sustain normal growth and those required 
for metabolite overproduction. For the successful appli -
cation of the evolved mutant described herein for bio-
production, further manipulation of the core metabolic 
pathways would be necessary. For proof of concept, 
we introduced changes into the evolved strain ALE-1 
machinery for it to attain an abundant supply of NADPH 
necessary for the production of 3-HP , an intermediate for 
many compounds. The bifunctionality of 3-HP enables 
it to be further transformed into a variety of high-value 
compounds [49–51]. From 1 mol of glucose, it is theoret -
ically possible to generate 2 mol of 3-HP with a consump-
tion of 4  mol of NADPH (Fig.  4a). However, its redox 
equivalent demand is far beyond the endogenous cata -
bolic supply based on glucose catabolism via the EDP or 
the linear PPP , which regenerates 1 or 2 mol of NADPH 
per mol of glucose [13]. According to the stoichiometry

production of 3-HP . A heterologous 3-HP synthetic pathway was introduced by expressing two dissected subparts, N-terminus and C-terminus 
ones, from the mutant malonyl-CoA reductase gene (mcr) derived from C. aurantiacus. ACC was overexpressed for malonyl-CoA accumulation 
while fatty acid synthesis was reduced by expressing a temperature-sensitive FabI at 37 °C. b 3-HP production titer at 48 h post-induction. Error bars 
indicate standard deviations of 3-HP titer for three independent biological replicates, respectively

of the EDP and PPP , restoration of cyclized PPP activ -
ity and the reduction of EDP activity might yield larger 
amounts of 3-HP [10, 13]. To address this issue, we dem-
onstrated the conditional flux control towards the EDP 
and PPP at the 6PG node for the enhanced production 
of 3-HP .
Before dealing with the redox issue, we attempted to 
eliminate a potential limiting factor, namely, the low 
availability of malonyl-CoA for 3-HP production. Effi -
cient microbial production of chemicals such as flavo -
noids and fatty acids using malonyl-CoA as a precursor 
are often constrained by the low intracellular concen -
trations of this compound [52]. In the present study, we 
overexpressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to enhance 
the supply of malonyl-CoA, and in conjunction per -
formed site-directed mutagenesis designed to increase 
the temperature sensitivity of endogenous enoyl-[acyl-
carrier-protein] reductase (FabI), thereby reducing the 
malonyl-CoA consumption via fatty acid synthesis [53, 
54] (Fig.  4a). At 48  h post-induction, the evolved strain 
ALE-1 produced 1.34  g/L of 3-HP , whereas the back -
ground strain produced 0.83  g/L. Although the evolved 
mutant produced a 1.6-fold higher 3-HP titer than the 
background strain under the same conditions, the fold-
increase was subtle, considering there was a substantial 
difference in biomass accumulation between the two 
strains (Fig. 1a and Fig. 4b).
To achieve conditional flux control towards the EDP 
and PPP , the E. coli gnd and gntR genes were expressed 
under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter, and 
the resulting pGnd and pGnd-GntR plasmids were 
transformed into ALE-1 harboring the 3-HP-producing 
machinery. Induction of flux redistribution to both the 
EDP and PPP in the 3-HP-producing ALE-1 mutant 
harboring pGnd led to a considerable enhancement in 
the 3-HP titer (1.99  g/L) at 48  h post-induction. Fur -
thermore, when the EDP was repressed by additional 
expression of its repressor GntR, 3-HP production in the 
evolved mutant increased further to 2.65  g/L, which is 
3.2- and 3.3-fold higher than the titer obtained from the 
background mutant and wild-type E. coli strains, respec -
tively, harboring the same 3-HP synthesis machinery 
(Fig. 4b and Additional file  1: Figure S2). These findings 
thus indicate that facilitating glucose flux via the PPP and 
reducing the flux through the EDP are critical for gen -
erating an abundant NADPH supply, resulting in higher 
3-HP production.
Conclusions
In this study, we generated and characterized an engi -
neered E. coli using EDP rather than EMPP as the major 
glycolytic pathway, whose pathway is not functional in 
the wild-type strain. Based on genetic and biochemical 
studies, we demonstrated that optimal cell growth of E. 
coli strain through the EDP requires three main meta -
bolic changes: (1) de-repression of the EDP by inacti -
vation of GntR, (2) inactivation of the oxidative PPP by 
deletion of Gnd, and (3) an increase in glucose uptake 
by the inactivation of GalR. Reverse engineering of the 
evolved strain was applied to enhance the production of 
3-HP by increasing glycolytic flux from the EDP to PPP 
for the supply of excess NADPH during the production 
stage rather than the growth stage. The engineered strain 
and its derivatives have certain advantages with respect 
to specific bio-production purposes, such as 3-HP and 
lycopene production, which demand NADPH (Fig.  4b 
and Additional file 1: Figure S7a, b).
Two EMPP-disrupted E. coli mutants, in which the 
pathway was blocked at the Pfk or Pgi step, resulted in 
distinct genotypic changes after ALE with glucose as the 
sole carbon source [18, 23, 55]. The evolved E. coli strain 
lacking pfkA showed a mutation in the promoter region 
of pfkB coding for a minor isozyme of Pfk. The expres -
sion of Pfk increased with time and this enabled the 
strain to restore glucose metabolism through the EMPP 
and could support cell growth. This observation indicates 
that, among three glycolytic pathways (EMPP , EDP , and 
PPP), the EMPP may be the most conducive for maximal 
cell growth in E. coli strains. The loss of Pgi led to a sig -
nificant increase in relative flux through the PPP . None 
of the evolved Δpgi mutants could influence the absolute 
EDP flux. Instead, independent studies have revealed that 
mutations leading to enhanced activity of transhydro -
genase have repeatedly been detected in adapted Δpgi 
mutants, suggesting that these mutations may reduce 
NADPH imbalance [23, 55–57]. In the present study, we 
found that the activation of the latent EDP by de-repress-
ing downregulation was one of the key fitness-enhancing 
factors during the adaptation of the Pfk-null mutant. 
These findings imply that there are fundamental differ -
ences in the metabolic apparatus of the Pfk- and Pgi-null 
mutants, although both are widely used to redirect the 
glycolytic flux to the EMPP . One of them is that PPP can 
be cyclized and produce more NADPH in the Pfk-null 
mutant.
Although slightly slower growth was found in ALE-1 
compared with the wild-type strain that employs the 
EMPP as the main glycolytic pathway, the evolved strain 
generated in this study grew well on glucose minimal 
medium compared with pgi- or pfkA-deleted strains 
that are characterized by a partially inactive EMPP . An 
additional factor that may contribute to the subopti -
mal growth of the evolved strain is that an imbalance 
or excess of NADPH produced from EDP can reduce 
cell growth when glucose is used as the sole carbon 
source. Notably, E. coli expressing G6PDH is strictly 
Page 11 of 16
Kim et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2022) 15:120 
 
 NADP+-specific compared with that in other bacteria 
that primarily employ the EDP as the glycolytic pathway 
[58–60]. Previous studies have reported that the growth 
of the pgi mutant could not be restored fully to that of 
the wild type rate by overexpressing UdhA for the re-
oxidation of NADPH, indicating that the transhydroge -
nase system is not sufficient to overcome an imbalance 
in NADPH [45]. When NADPH-consuming pathways 
(lycopene and 3-HP production) were engineered in 
ALE-1, we observed the recovery of cell growth; the lyco -
pene- and 3-HP-producing ALE-1 cell showed higher 
cell growth than the wild type. These findings suggest 
that the evolved strain could be a suitable host cell for 
NADPH-dependent bio-production, as slightly reduced 
cell growth minimally affects production.
The selection of a suitable host cell for the production 
of a biotechnology-based product is crucial to ensure 
economic viability. The bacterium, E. coli, is one of the 
best-characterized microorganisms from the genetic 
and metabolic perspectives and has a variety of tracta -
ble traits for biotechnological production. However, tol -
erance to adverse environmental stress, or unfavorable 
redox potentials may impede the use of E. coli as a plat -
form host organism. The selection of host cells for pro -
duction should be based on several factors, including the 
availability of genetic tools for expressing target prod -
ucts, efficient utilization of alternative carbon sources, 
high redox potential, and a tolerance to the metabolic 
products. Furthermore, unlike Pseudomonas and Zymo -
monas, ALE-1 can co-metabolize glucose and xylose, 
which was the case in the ptsG-deleted E. coli strains 
(Additional file 1: Figure S7d–f). ALE-1 strain even grows 
under anoxic conditions using nitrate as a final electron 
acceptor (Additional file 1: Figure S7c).
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the nor -
mally latent EDP in E. coli can be almost fully activated 
by enhancing glucose uptake through an inactivation of 
GalR, inactivating the EDP regulatory system, and block -
ing the glycolytic flux via the PPP . The resulting strain and 
its derivatives have advantageous traits that are found 
in microorganisms using the EDP and PPP as the major 
glycolytic route, and it is amenable to host strong redox 
reactions. The engineered strains could expand the utility 
of E. coli as a platform for biotechnological production.
Materials and methods
Reagents, strains and media
Unless otherwise indicated, the reagents used in this 
study were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, 
MO, USA).
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study 
are listed in Additional file  1: Table S1. The wild-type E. 
coli MG1655 strain was used as a parent strain for the 
generation of mutant strains. The E. coli DH10B strain 
was used for bacterial transformation and plasmid 
amplification during the construction of the expression 
plasmids.
Unless otherwise stated, as growth media, we used 
M9 minimal medium (BioShop Canada Inc., Burl -
ington, Canada) supplemented with 2  mM  MgSO4, 
0.1  mM  CaCl2, and glucose with appropriate antibiot -
ics, if required, and Luria–Bertani (LB) medium. The LB 
medium was prepared using 5  g/L yeast extract, 10  g/L 
peptone and 10  g/L NaCl. Antibiotics were used at the 
following concentrations: ampicillin (100  mg/L), kana -
mycin (50 mg/L), and chloramphenicol (30 mg/L).
Cell culture
For growth measurements, a single colony from an agar 
plate was inoculated in 3  mL of LB medium at 37  °C and 
shaken at 200 rpm. Overnight-grown cells were 1:10 diluted 
into 5 mL of M9 medium supplemented with 4 g/L glucose. 
After growing for 12 h, cells were inoculated into 25 mL of 
M9 medium in 250-mL shaking flask at 37  °C and shaken 
at 200  rpm to achieve an initial optical density at 600  nm 
 (OD600) of approximately 0.1. For functional analysis, a 
single colony was cultivated in 3  mL of LB medium with 
appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C and shaken at 200 rpm over-
night. A seeded culture was 1:10 diluted into 5  mL of M9 
medium supplemented with 4  g/L glucose and appropri -
ate antibiotics. After 12 h in culture, cells were diluted into 
25 mL of M9 medium in a 250 mL shaking flask to achieve 
an initial  OD600 of 0.1. The expression of galP and edd-eda 
was induced by the addition of 6.25  µM of isopropyl-β-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at the beginning of seeding, 
subculturing, and culturing. The expression of pRFP , pGnd, 
and pGnd-GntR plasmids was induced by the addition of 
50  µM of IPTG after 3  h in culture.  OD600 was measured 
using a Libra S22 spectrophotometer.
For 3-HP production, a single colony from an agar 
plate was used to inoculate 3 mL of LB medium at 30 °C 
and shaken at 200  rpm. Overnight-grown cells were 
1:20 inoculated into M9 medium supplemented with 
20  g/L glucose, 1.0  g/L yeast extract, 2  mM  MgSO4, 
0.1  mM  CaCl2, and trace elements. The composition of 
the trace element solution used was as follows: 2.4  g of 
 FeCl3·6H2O, 0.3 g of  CoCl2·6H2O, 0.15 g of  CuCl2·2H2O, 
0.3 g of  ZnCl2, 0.3 g of  Na2MO4·2H2O, 0.075 g of  H3BO3, 
and 0.495 g of  MnCl2·4H2O per liter [54]. After growing 
at 30 °C and shaken at 200 rpm for 9 h, 50 µM of IPTG 
and 100  nM of tetracycline were added to induce the 
expression of mcrC*-mcrN, and accDABC, after which 
the temperature of the culture was increased to 37 °C.
Adaptive laboratory evolution
To isolate rapidly growing mutants, even those lacking a 
functional EMPP , a mutant in which both the pfkA and 
Page 12 of 16Kim et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2022) 15:120 
pfkB genes had been deleted was adapted by sequential 
transfer. Initially, an overnight culture of ∆pfkAB mutant 
cells in LB was transferred to M9 minimal medium sup -
plemented with 2 mM  MgSO4, 0.1 mM  CaCl2 and 5 g/L 
glucose and grown at 37  °C and shaken at 200  rpm. At 
an  OD600 of approximately 1.0, the cells were passaged 
to a 250-mL shaking flask containing 25 mL of the same 
fresh M9 medium. This procedure was repeated 50 times, 
after which, the adapted cells were plated onto an LB agar 
plate. Five evolved mutants showing the most rapid bio -
mass accumulation were selected based on  OD600 values 
monitored using a 96-well microplate reader and named 
pfk_ALE-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 (henceforth referred to as 
ALE-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5).
Genome sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from the evolved ALE-1 
strain using a DNA isolation kit (GeneAll Biotechnology 
Co., Korea), and subsequently sequenced via next-genera-
tion sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer 
(Macrogen Inc., Korea). The genomic sequence of E. 
coli MG1655 (NC_000913.3) was used as a reference. 
Read sequence data of wild-type and ALE-1 strains were 
deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the 
NCBI under BioProject accession number PRJNA818725, 
and BioSample accession number SAMN26878847 for 
wild-type strain, SAMN26878848 for ALE-1 strain. 
The occurrence of mutations was confirmed by DNA 
sequencing of the PCR amplicon of target regions in the 
background strain and evolved mutant. To analyze the 
mutation frequency, the presence of mutations that were 
either the same or equivalent to the mutations discovered 
in ALE-1 was analyzed in the other four ALE mutants by 
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing.
Genetic manipulation
Gene knockout was conducted by homologous recom -
bination via a λ RED recombination system, which was 
mediated by a kanamycin resistance  (KmR) cassette 
flanked by Flp recognition target (FRT) knock-in and 
flippase-based curing [61, 62]. Knockout constructs were 
designed with 50-bp overhangs homologous to upstream 
and downstream sequences of the deletion site. Cells 
were screened for antibiotic sensitivity, and for those 
lacking antibiotic resistance, removal of the  KmR gene 
was confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing.
Point mutations were generated via oligonucleotide-
mediated genome editing combined with a tetA-based 
dual selection system. The tetA cassette was inserted into 
the target site and replaced with oligos containing tar -
get mutations and short 50-bp overhangs homologous 
to sequences upstream and downstream of the insertion 
site. The recombinants were isolated by negative selection 
using 50  μM  NiCl2. Cells were screened for antibiotic 
sensitivity, and for those lacking antibiotic resistance, the 
correct allelic replacement was confirmed by colony PCR 
and sequencing.
Plasmid construction
All plasmids constructed in this study were derived from 
BioBrick plasmids [63]. The primers used for plasmid 
cloning are listed in Additional file 1: Table S2. The prim-
ers were synthesized by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). 
Plasmid construction was conducted using Pfu-X DNA 
Polymerase for the PCR reactions, and all restriction 
enzymes used were purchased from Fermentas (Vilnius, 
Lithuania). For plasmid isolation, we used a LaboPass 
plasmid miniprep kit (Cosmo Genentech, Korea). DNA 
purification (Cat. no.103-102) and gel extraction (Cat. 
no.102-102) kits were purchased from GeneAll Biotech -
nology (Seoul, Korea).
For the construction of pEdd-Eda, the gene encod -
ing the red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the pBbA6c-rfp  
vector was excised using restriction enzymes, EcoRI and 
BamHI. The edd-eda gene cluster was amplified from E. 
coli MG1655 genomic DNA using a forward primer con -
taining an EcoRI site and a reverse primer containing a 
BamHI site. Following excision with EcoRI and Bam HI, 
the purified edd-eda fragment was ligated with the gel-
eluted pBbA6c backbone.
For cloning the pGalP , the RFP-encoding gene in the 
pBbS6k-rfp vector was excised using restriction enzymes, 
BglII and XhoI. The E. coli galP gene was amplified from 
E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA using a forward primer 
containing a BglII site and a reverse primer containing an 
XhoI site. Following excision with restriction enzymes, 
BglII and XhoI, the purified galP  fragment was ligated 
with the gel-eluted pBbS6k backbone.
To construct pGnd, the RFP-encoding gene in the pRFP 
vector was excised using EcoRI and XhoI. The E. coli gnd 
gene was amplified from the E. coli MG1655 genomic 
DNA with a forward primer containing an EcoRI site and 
a reverse primer containing an XhoI site. Following exci -
sion with EcoRI and XhoI, the purified gnd fragment was 
ligated with the gel-eluted pRFP backbone.
For the construction of pGnd-GntR, the E. coli gntR 
gene was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA 
with a forward primer containing a BglII site and a 
reverse primer containing the XhoI site. Following exci -
sion with restriction enzymes, BglII and XhoI, the puri -
fied gntR fragment was ligated with the purified pGnd.
For the construction of the pMCR plasmid, a mcrC *-
mcrN fragment including genes encoding the dissected 
C-terminal domain carrying three mutations (N391V/
K557W/S565N) and the N-terminal domain of malo -
nyl-CoA reductase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus was

extracted after cutting the pCDF-mcrC*-mcrN plasmid 
at EcoRI and XhoI sites. The pBbE2k-rfp  plasmid was 
digested with restriction enzymes, EcoRI and XhoI to 
excise the gene encoding RFP , after which the DNA frag-
ment and the gel-eluted pBbE2k backbone were ligated.
For the construction of a pACC plasmid, a fragment 
harboring the accDABC gene cluster encoding the ACC 
complex was obtained by elution after cutting pBbA2k-
accDABC at BglII and XhoI sites. The pBbA6c-rfp  plas -
mid was digested with restriction enzymes, BglII and 
XhoI to excise the gene encoding RFP . After gel-elution, 
the pBbA6c backbone was ligated with the eluted accD -
ABC fragment.
Transcriptome analysis (RNA‑seq)
Cell culture samples were harvested at the mid-log 
growth phase  (OD600 ~ 0.5 for MG1655 and ALE-1 
strain). The RNA was stabilized using by  RNAprotect® 
Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen #76506) and total RNA was 
isolated using  RNeasy® Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen #74134). 
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed from isolated 
RNA samples through riboPooL Probes (Pan-prokar -
yote) siTOOLS BIOTECH and  Dynabeads™  MyOne™ 
Streptavidin C1(Invitrogen #65001). For purification of 
RNA samples, RNA clean & concentrator (zymoresearch 
R1013) was used. RNA library was constructed from 
rRNA-depleted RNA using the KAPA stranded RNA-
seq kit (Roche KK8400). The sequencing libraries were 
sequenced by Nextseq 550, NextSeq 500/550 High Out -
put Kit v2.5 (024906).
Using bowtie software, the sequence reads were 
mapped onto the wild-type reference genome 
(NC_000913.2) with the maximum insert size option of 
1500  bp (for Additional file  1: Figure S8, 500-bp option 
was used) [64]. Fragments per kilobase of exon per mil -
lion fragments (FPKM) and  log2 fold change value were 
calculated by cufflinks [65]. All the datasets were visual -
ized using Metascope and NimbleGen’s Signalmap soft -
ware. The transcriptomic data of wild-type and ALE-1 
strains were deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) under GEO Series accession number 
GSE199153.
On the other hand, the unexpected expression level 
of the pfkB gene in ALE-1 was affected by a remaining 
coding sequence of pfkB (Additional file  1: Figure S8). 
Considering that the active site of PfkB was deleted, we 
anticipated that the function for PfkB in the ALE-1 strain 
was lost.
Flow cytometric analysis
For cultivation, a single colony was inoculated in 3 mL of 
LB medium at 37 °C and shaken at 200 rpm. Overnight-
grown cells were 1:50 diluted into 5 mL of M9 medium 
supplemented with 4 g/L glucose and 5 g/L yeast extract. 
After growing for 9 h, cells were collected and transferred 
to PBS. The KDPG-responsible biosensor was induced by 
the addition of 50 µM of IPTG at the beginning of seed -
ing and culturing. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
fluorescence intensity of individual cells was measured by 
BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Bioscience, USA) 
with wavelength of 488 nm excitation. Nonbacterial par -
ticles were excluded by applying forward-scattered char -
acteristics and side-scattered characteristics. Gate M1 
was set to differentiate the population of cells based on 
fluorescence intensity. BD CellQuest Pro software was 
used to analyze the data and to create images.
Analytical methods
Culture media were treated using previously reported 
methods with minor modifications [66]. After centri -
fuging for 30  min at 13,200 × g, the supernatant was 
heat-treated at 80 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the supernatant 
obtained by centrifuging again for 30  min at 13,200 × g 
was used for analysis.
The concentrations of glucose and 3-HP were meas -
ured by HPLC using a previously described method

tions detected in pfk_ALE-2, -3, and -5 strains. (a) Growth rate profiles 
 (OD600) were compared for the four evolved strains isolated after the 
50th subculture during ALE. Growth rate profiles of ΔpfkAB and ALE-1 
Page 14 of 16Kim et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2022) 15:120 
strains are presented as controls. (b, c) DNA sequence of wild-type and 
mutant galR coding region in ALE-2, -3 and -5 strains were compared. 
The sequences include the start codon (lower case), emerging site of 
early stop codon (grey box), duplicated target sequence (underlined), 
duplication (red), and insertion (blue). Adenine in the start codon of the 
galR gene is designated as +1. (b) A nonsense mutation was caused by 
a frame shift due to a 7-bp duplication in the galR gene of the ALE-2, -3 
strains, which resulted in truncation of the C-terminal 33 amino acids of 
the total 344 amino acids. (c) Insertion of 768 bp and duplication of 8 bp 
in the galR gene of ALE-5 caused insertion of 259 amino acids between 
the 3rd and 4th amino acids of the wild-type GalR protein. These GalR 
mutants are expected to be equivalent to the GalR mutant of ALE-1, 
which has low binding affinity to target sequence in the absence of an 
appropriate inducer, galactose. Figure. S2 Cell growth and 3-HP , glucose, 
and acetate concentration during 3-HP production. All strains have a fabI 
temperature-sensitive mutant (fabIts) and two plasmids pMCR and pACC. 
Profiles of 3-HP concentration (red circles), cell mass (yellow triangles), 
consumed glucose concentration (green squares) and acetate (blue dia-
monds) were compared for E. coli strains: (a) MG1655 (b) MG1655 ∆pfkA (c) 
MG1655 ∆pgi (d) ΔpfkAB (e) ALE-1 (f ) ALE-1 with pGnd and (g) ALE-1 with 
pGnd-GntR. Cell mass was calculated from the  OD600 values. 1  OD600 unit 
corresponds to 0.33 g CDW/L [1]. Error bars indicate standard deviations 
of three independent biological replicates. Figure. S3 The comparison of 
cell growth between pfk_ALE-1 and pfk_ALE-1 Δedd strains. Growth rate 
profiles  (OD600) of ALE-1 Δedd strain was compared to that of ALE-1 strain 
on glucose as a sole carbon source. Cells were grown in 250 mL with 
25 mL of M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% glucose. Error bars indicate 
standard deviations of three independent biological replicates. Figure 
.S4 Functional analysis of mutations involved in glucose uptake system 
in the evolved strains. (a) Target genes affected by the mutated TF (GalR) 
or ptsG deletion were identified and their role for improved cell growth in 
ALE-1 were determined. Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with 
0.4% glucose in shaking flasks. IPTG (6.25 µM) was added at the beginning 
of seeding, subculturing, and culturing to induce each plasmid. Error bars 
indicate standard deviations of three independent biological replicates. 
(b) The schematic diagram illustrates the altered route of glucose uptake 
in ALE-1 via a non-PTS glucose transporter GalP , the expression of which is 
negatively regulated by GalR. Figure. S5 Comparison of mRNA expression 
level of galP and talB in ALE-1 with MG1655. The mRNA expression level 
of galP and talB in MG1655 (gray bar) and ALE-1 (black bar) was analyzed 
by quantitative RT-PCR. Error bars indicate standard deviations of three 
independent biological replicates. Figure. S6 Flow cytometric analysis of 
pHexR-GFP with expression of gnd and/or gntR genes at 9 hours cultiva-
tion. Fluorescence histograms of pHexR-GFP ALE-1, ALE-1 pGnd, and 
ALE-1 pGnd-GntR strain were compared. Gate M1 was used to differenti-
ate the population of wild-type and EMPP-deficient strains based on GFP 
intensity. Figure. S7 Diverse phenotypic characteristics of pfk_ALE-1. (a, 
b) Lycopene production was examined in ALE-1 and control strains all 
harboring the pAC-LYCO04 plasmid. (a) Lycopene titer of E. coli strains 
after 24 h of cultivation were compared. (b) Color of lycopene-producing 
strains after 24 h of cultivation. Two milliliters of lycopene-producing cells 
were harvested after 24 h of cultivation and re-suspended in 200 µL of 
distilled water. After transfer to 96-well plates, images of cells were taken 
using a 96-well microplate reader. (c) When nitrate was used as the final 
electron acceptor under anoxic conditions,  OD600 of ALE-1 and MG1655 
were measured. For  OD600 of MG1655 with nitrate addition, there was 
no significant difference caused by nitrate addition (data not shown). 
(d–f ) Residual sugar concentration and cell growth of ALE-1 and MG1655 
strains when grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 3 g/L of 
glucose and 2 g/L of xylose. Residual glucose and xylose concentration of 
(d) MG1655 and (e) ALE-1 strain. (f ) The cell growth of both strains is pre-
sented. Figure. S8 Unexpected expression level of the pfkB gene of ALE-1. 
In the process of deletion of the pfkB gene, nucleotides of 157bp from the 
5′ end and 177bp from the 3′ end were detected. Using bowtie software, 
the sequence reads were mapped onto the wild-type reference genome 
(NC_000913.2) with the maximum insert size option of 500bp. Remained 
coding sequence of the pfkB gene affected the expression level of the pfkB 
gene of ALE-1. Table S1. Strains and plasmid list. Table S2. Primer List.
