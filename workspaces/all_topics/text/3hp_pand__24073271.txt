Abstract
The formation of fusion protein in biosynthetic pathways usually improves metabolic efficiency either channeling
intermediates and/or colocalizing enzymes. In the metabolic engineering of biochemical pathways, generating
unnatural protein fusions between sequential biosynthetic enzymes is a useful method to increase system efficiency
and product yield. Here, we reported a special case. The malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) of Chloroflexus aurantiacus
catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), and is a key enzyme in microbial production
of 3HP, an important platform chemical. Functional domain analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of MCR
(MCR-N; amino acids 1-549) and the C-terminal region of MCR (MCR-C; amino acids 550-1219) were functionally
distinct. The malonyl-CoA was reduced into free intermediate malonate semialdehyde with NADPH by MCR-C
fragment, and further reduced to 3HP by MCR-N fragment. In this process, the initial reduction of malonyl-CoA was
rate limiting. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the TGXXXG(A)X(1-2)G and YXXXK motifs were
important for enzyme activities of both MCR-N and MCR-C fragments. Moreover, the enzyme activity increased when
MCR was separated into two individual fragments. Kinetic analysis showed that MCR-C fragment had higher affinity
for malonyl-CoA and 4-time higher Kcat/Km value than MCR. Dissecting MCR into MCR-N and MCR-C fragments also
had a positive effect on the 3HP production in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. Our study showed the feasibility
of protein dissection as a new strategy in biosynthetic systems.

Introduction
The malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (MCR) of
phototrophic green nonsulfur bacterium Chloroflexus
aurantiacus is a bifunctional enzyme with alcohol
dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating)
activities. MCR catalyzes the two-step reduction of malonyl-
CoA with NADPH to 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), and malonate
semialdehyde was suggested as the likely free intermediate
(Fig. 1) [ 1]. 3HP, the reaction product of MCR, is an important
platform chemical ranked in the list of top 12 value added
chemicals from biomass released by the US Department of
Energy [ 2]. MCR has been used in engineered strains
producing 3HP or poly(3HP), a biocompatible and
biodegradable thermoplastic. However, the low enzyme activity
of MCR expressed in recombinant strains limited the 3HP and
poly(3HP) production [3,4].
In biosynthetic pathways, the formation of fusion proteins
catalyzing sequential reactions usually improves metabolic
efficiency either by channeling intermediates or by localizing
active sites in close proximity [ 5]. Linking genes together to
generate a functional fusion protein has become an attractive
strategy for metabolic engineering purposes, and was
successfully applied in microbial production of resveratrol [ 6],
miltiradiene [7], etc.
Here, we report a special case that MCR, a natural fusion
protein of two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, has
higher enzyme activity when separated into two fragments. The
in vivo  dissection of MCR also resulted in improved 3HP
production by a recombinant Escherichia coli strain.

(Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Western blot
The E. coli BL21(DE3) strains carrying expression plasmids
for MCR and its derivative proteins were grown at 37°C in
minimal medium, which contains 30 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0), 2 g/L (NH 4)2SO4, 0.2 g/L MgSO 4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L
yeast extract, and 20 g/L glucose. The cells were induced at
~0.6 OD 600 with 0.05 mM IPTG and further cultured for 4 h.
Then cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with
PBS buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. The cells
were disrupted by sonication, the cell lysates were centrifuged,
and the supernatants were used for immunoblot analysis. The
concentrations of soluble protein samples were determined
using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Tiangen, China) using
bovine serum albumin as a standard. 20 µg of soluble proteins
were applied onto SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot
using anti-His6 antibody.
Protein purification
The His6-tagged MCR wild-type and derivative proteins were
purified from E. coli  BL21(DE3) cell extracts using Ni-NTA
His·Bind Column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The eluted protein was dialyzed in PBS buffer
overnight. Protein concentrations were determined as above.
The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.
Mass spectrometry analysis
The enzyme reaction mixture (300 µl) contained 100 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.4 mM NADPH, and 0.05
nmol (each) of purified protein(s). The reaction was started by
the addition of 0.15 mM malonyl-CoA and was incubated at
57°C for 2 min. Then the reaction was stopped by addition of
1.2 mL acetonitrile. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-triple

quadrupole mass spectrometer (HPLC-QQQMS). Mass spectra
were acquired on an Agilent 1290/6430 instrument (Agilent,
CA, USA) in the negative-ion mode. Full scan mass spectra
were obtained, and the ion chromatograms of malonyl-CoA,
malonate semialdehyde, and 3HP were extracted using the m/z
of 862, 87, and 89, respectively.
Enzyme assays
The assay mixture (300 µL) contained 100 mM Tris-HCl
(pH7.8), 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.4 mM NADPH, and 0.05 nmol (each)
of purified protein(s). The reaction was started by the addition
of 0.15 mM malonyl-CoA and was incubated at 57°C for 30 s.
NADPH concentration was monitored at 365 nm ( ε365nm=3.4x
103 M-1cm-1) using Varian, Cary 50 Bio UV-Visible
Spectrophotometer, and the enzyme activity was calculated
according to the speed of NADPH oxidation.
To determine the optimal temperature for His 6-tagged MCR
and MCR-C, the reactions were incubated at a series of
temperatures (32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, and 67°C). To
determine the optimal pH, Tris-HCl buffers with different pH
(pH 6.6, 7.2, 7.8, 8.4, and 9.0) were tested. To determine the
Km and Kcat values, a series of malonyl-CoA concentrations
(0.05, 0.058, 0.067, 0.083, 0.1, 0.125, and 0.15 mM) were used
and the reactions were carried out at 57°C at pH7.8 and pH7.2
for MCR and MCR-C protein, respectively.
3HP production
The strains E. coli  BL21(DE3)/pA-accADBC/pMCR and E.
coli BL21(DE3)/pA-accADBC/pMCR-N-C were grown overnight
in LB broth and 1:100 diluted into 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer
flasks containing 100 mL of minimal medium as described
above. The recombinant cells were induced at ~0.6 OD 600 with
0.05 mM IPTG. IPTG (0.05 mM), biotin (40 mg/L), and NaHCO3
(20 mM) were added periodically every 12 h until 48 h. The
western blot was performed as above. The enzyme activity was
determined using total soluble proteins at pH7.2 at 37 °C. The
3HP concentration in medium was determined by HPLC as
described previously [ 3]. All shake flask experiments were
carried out in triplicates.
Results and Discussion
Sequence analysis of MCR
MCR is composed of 1219 amino acid residues, and does
not share significant sequence similarity with any known
protein [ 1]. Conserved domains analysis revealed two short-
chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domains, composed of
amino acids 1-283 and amino acids 550-782. In each SDR
domain, there are two sequence motifs (TGXXXG(A)X(1-2)G)
forming Rossmann fold structure for NAD(P) (H) binding [ 8],
and a conserved YXXXK motif, implicated as the catalytic site
in SDR family proteins [ 9]. Taken into account that MCR
protein catalyzes a two-step reaction of malonyl-CoA reduction

Functional Dissection of MCR
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e75554
to 3HP, it is speculated that the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions of MCR protein are functionally distinct, responsible for
the alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase
(CoA-acylating) activity, respectively. Thus the N-terminal
region of MCR (amino acids 1-549) was defined as MCR-N and
the C-terminal region (amino acids 550-1219) as MCR-C.
Analysis of functional domains in the MCR protein
To elucidate the function of each domain of MCR, an
appropriate set of expression vectors was constructed for His 6-
tagged MCR, MCR-N, and MCR-C genes under the IPTG-
inducible T7 promoter (Figure 2A and Table 1). The proteins
expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) was confirmed by immunoblot
analysis of total soluble proteins using anti-His 6 antibody.
These proteins were observed as 135-kDa, 62-kDa, and 83-
kDa bands, respectively (Figure 2B).
The His 6-tagged MCR, MCR-N, and MCR-C proteins were
purified using Ni-NTA His·Bind Column and analyzed by SDS-
PAGE (Figure 3A). The enzymatic activities were examined in
vitro using malonyl-CoA as a substrate and NADPH as co-
factor at 57°C. NADPH oxidation was monitored at 365 nm
(ε365nm=3.4x 103 M-1cm-1), and the product was analyzed by LC-
MS. The MCR-N fragment showed no conversion of malonyl-
CoA (Figure 3B, panel 2). In contrast, NADPH was oxidated
when MCR-C was used, and LC-MS analysis showed a new
peak with a mass of 87 Da ( Figure 3B, panel 3), corresponding
to the mass of ionized malonate semialdehyde, demonstrating
that the MCR-C protein can catalyze the reduction of malonyl-
CoA to malonate semialdehyde solely. Since malonate
semialdehyde is not commercially available, the activity of
MCR-N fragment was tested using malonyl-CoA as substrate
along with MCR-C and the production of 3HP should indicate
the activity of MCR-N fragment. As shown in Figure 3B panel 4,
malonate semialdehyde was transformed into 3HP. Taken
together, these results demonstrated that MCR-N and MCR-C
are functionally distinct, representing alcohol dehydrogenase
and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating) activity,
respectively. Furthermore, the malonate semialdehyde was
experimentally identified as free intermediate in MCR reaction.
The classical SDR has a chain length of about 250 amino
acid residues, which is much shorter than MCR-N and MCR-C
fragments. Truncated derivatives of MCR-N and MCR-C
proteins, like MCR 1-485 and MCR 550-1170, were also tested. The
deletions of C-terminal amino acid residues in both MCR-C and
MCR-N fragments completely eliminated the corresponding
enzyme activity, suggesting that the C-terminal sequences in
both fragments have some unknown but important role, such
as stabilizing the protein structure, binding with the substrates,
etc.
Kinetic analyses of the MCR-C protein fragment
In Figure 3B, it was observed that the peak of 3HP product
was higher and the peak of malonyl-CoA substrate was smaller
in panel 4 when compared with panel 1. This phenomenon
indicated that the enzymatic activity increased somehow when
MCR was separated into two proteins. Though the mass
spectrometric response is quantitative, this data was unable to
be used in a quantitative manner because of the unavailability
of malonate semialdehyde standard. So the kinetic analyses
were carried out in vitro  spectrophotometrically. To test this
speculation, enzyme activities of MCR and MCR-N/MCR-C
were determined using 0.05 nmol (each) of purified protein(s)
at pH7.8 at 57°C. As shown in Figure 4A, the MCR protein and
MCR-N/MCR-C mixture catalyzed the reduction of malonyl-
CoA with activities of 0.47 ± 0.05 and 1.02 ± 0.05 mmol/min/
μmol protein, respectively ( p<0.01), suggesting that the
combined activity of MCR-N and MCR-C fragments is greater
than that of wild type MCR protein.
In reactions catalyzed by either MCR or MCR-N/MCR-C,
malonate semialdehyde was not accumulated (Figure 3B ,

panel 1 and 4), and the kinetics of malonyl-CoA dependent
oxidation of NADPH followed normal Michaelis-Menten
kinetics. No clear sign of a biphasic reaction was observed,
suggesting that the reduction of the malonate semialdehyde to
3HP is fast and the reduction of malonyl-CoA to semialdehyde
is rate-limiting step. So we focused on the MCR-C fragment
and determined its activity in vitro. Malonyl-CoA was reduced
to malonate semialdehyde at pH7.8 at 57°C by MCR-C
fragment with an activity of 0.99 ± 0.12 mmol/min/ μmol protein,
which is more than 2-times higher than that of MCR protein
(Figure 4A).
The optimal temperature and pH for MCR-C were
determined. The enzyme activity was highest at 57 °C, and
was fairly stable over the temperature range of 37-62 °C
(Figure 4B). The optimal pH for activity was pH7.2, showed a
significant shift compared with MCR (Figure 4C). MCR-C
fragment has an apparent Km value of 23.8 ± 1.9 µmol for
malonyl-CoA, lower than that of MCR (41.7±2.2 µmol), and the
Kcat/Km value of MCR-C fragment was about 4-fold higher than
MCR protein (Table 2), suggesting that MCR-C fragment has
higher affinity for malonyl-CoA and higher catalyzing efficiency
than MCR protein. Due to the absence of sequence similarity
with other proteins and lack of MCR protein structure
information, the mechanistic basis of activity enhancement
remains unknown. It is assumed that the N-terminal structure
blocks the entrance of C-terminal domain active site to a
certain extent in MCR protein, and malonyl-CoA can get into
the catalytic center of C-terminal domain more easily when two
domains are apart.
Determination of essential amino acid residues in each
fragment
Two conserved motifs of NADPH binding site and one of
SDR reactive site were found in both MCR-N and MCR-C
fragments. To confirm the importance of amino acid residues in
these motifs, several point mutation versions of MCR-N or
MCR-C fragments were constructed, including G5R, G16R,
and Y171G/K175G mutants of MCR-N fragment, G554R,
G579R, and Y737G/K741G mutants of MCR-C fragment
(Figure 5A). For the MCR-C fragment, G579R and Y737G/
K741G completely abolished aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-
acylating) activity of MCR-C fragment and no malate
semialdehyde product could be detected, while the G554R
mutant showed the similar activity with MCR-C wild-type
fragment (Figure 5B). The activities of MCR-N mutants were
tested along with wild-type MCR-C fragment using malonyl-
CoA as substrate. The G16R and Y171G/K175G mutants
resulted in the MCR-N inactivation as the intermediate
malonate semialdehyde but not 3HP was accumulated in the

reaction mixture, and the G5R mutant only had a modest effect
on reaction velocity and can still converted the malonate
semialdehyde into 3HP (Figure 5B). These data suggested that
the conserved reactive motif of SDR, YXXXK, is essential for
robust alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase
(CoA-acylating) activity of the corresponding fragment. Despite
the fact that two conserved NADPH binding motifs were found
in both MCR-N and MCR-C fragments, only one of them
(15TGGAGNIG22 and578TGGSAGIG585) has important effects on
the reactivity of the corresponding domains. Mutagenesis of
reactive motifs and NADPH binding sites in full-length MCR
protein also confirmed the above results.
In vivo effect of separated MCR protein
To determine the effect of dissection-dependent MCR activity
improvement on 3HP production in vivo , two recombinant E.
coli strains were constructed. One carries the wild-type MCR
protein expression vector pMCR, and the other one possesses
vector pMCR-N-C to overexpress separated MCR-N and MCR-
C fragments. The plasmid pA- accADBC carrying acetyl-CoA
carboxylase gene [ 10] was used to channel the carbon into
3HP production in both strains. These strains were grown in
minimal medium using glucose as the sole carbon source. After
48 h incubation, the cells were collected and disrupted by
sonication, and equal amount of soluble protein extracts were
used to determine the protein expression level and enzyme
activity. As shown in Figure 6A, the MCR-C fragment was
significantly less expressed than full length protein and the
comparison of MCR protein with MCR-N fragment showed
intensities of the same order of magnitude. The enzyme activity
was tested in Tris-HCl buffer pH7.2 at 37 °C to farthest mimic
E. coli intracellular conditions. The soluble protein extracts from
strains carrying pMCR-N-C and pMCR catalyzed the formation
of 3HP from malonyl-CoA at apparent activities of 0.95 ± 0.09
and 0.61 ± 0.07 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively ( p<0.01)
(Figure 6B). HPLC analysis of culture supernatant showed that
the strain carrying pMCR-N-C accumulated 0.150 ± 0.005 g/L
3HP, while the strain carrying pMCR produced 0.107 ± 0.006
g/L 3HP (p<0.01) (Figure 3C). These results demonstrated that
the isolated MCR-C fragment, in vivo as well as in vitro, is more
active than the C-terminal domain integrated in the full length
MCR protein, and dissection of MCR protein do have a positive
effect on microbial 3HP production.
Although the 3HP level is still low, our study showed
feasibility to develop a new strategy for metabolic engineering
by separating a multifunctional protein into individual
fragments. It has some expected advantages. First, the
separated fragments may have enhanced overall enzyme
activity. For example, some bifunctional oxidoreductases, like
AdhE from Escherichia coli  and Aad/AdhE from Clostridium

acetobutylicum [11,12], catalyze reactions similar with MCR,
the reduction of a CoA thioester of an organic acid to its
corresponding alcohol using NADH as a cofactor. Second,
expression and folding of large multidomain proteins are
typically inefficient in bacteria [ 13]. The ols gene of
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 encodes a large multidomain
protein (302 kDa) involved in α-olefin biosynthesis [ 14].
However, the codon-optimized ols gene still cannot be
expressed in E. coli  [15]. A possible solution could be
separating this protein into short functional fragments.

Conclusions
In summary, Chloroflexus aurantiacus MCR can be split into
two functional fragments, MCR-N and MCR-C presenting
alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-
acylating) activities, respectively. Separating MCR into MCR-N
and MCR-C fragments resulted in increased enzyme activity
and 3HP production in a recombinant E. coli strain. Differently
with constructing fusion proteins to improve metabolic
efficiency and product yield, this study showed feasibility to
develop a new strategy for metabolic engineering.
