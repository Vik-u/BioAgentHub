Abstract 
Plastic degrading enzymes have immense potential for use in industrial applications. Protein engineering efforts over the last decade have 
resulted in considerable enhancement of many properties of these enzymes. Directed evolution, a protein engineering approach that mimics 
the natural process of evolution in a laboratory, has been particularly useful in overcoming some of the challenges of structure-based protein 
engineering. For example, directed evolution has been used to improve the catalytic activity and thermostability of polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET)-degrading enzymes, although its use for the improvement of other desirable properties, such as solvent tolerance, has been less studied. 
In this review, we aim to identify some of the knowledge gaps and current challenges, and highlight recent studies related to the directed 
evolution of plastic-degrading enzymes.

Developments in the ﬁeld of enzymatic plastic 
degradation 
The increasing amount of plastic waste has become a global 
issue and enzymatic plastic recycling could facilitate the tran-
sition to a circular plastic economy. Economic studies have 
highlighted the potential benefits of using enzymatic recycling 
in industrial applications (
Singh et al. 2021). Nonetheless, 
naturally occurring PET-degrading enzymes are generally not 
suitable for such purposes, as they require improvement to 
both stability and catalytic efficiency. Rational protein engi-
neering has been successfully applied to design enhanced PET-
hydrolysing enzymes previously (
Son et al. 2019, Cui et al. 
2021, Jerves et al.2024). For example, Tournier et al. achieved 
over 90% PET depolymerisation in 10hours with an improved 
variant of leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) (Tournier et al. 
2020). 
Directed evolution can complement rational approaches by 
screening a large number of randomly, or semi-randomly gen-
erated variants to enhance various enzyme properties, extend-
ing beyond catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, 
the lack of effective high-throughput screening methods has 
been the main obstacle to applying directed evolution to 
plastic-degrading enzymes (
Zhu et al. 2021). Recent efforts 
have made significant advances in overcoming those chal-
lenges, particularly in the field of PET-degrading enzymes. 
However, similar advancements for evolving enzymes that 
degrade other prominent plastics, such as polyurethane (PU) 
and polyamides, remain relatively limited. 
This review provides an overview of the current research 
and emerging trends in applying directed evolution to plastic 
degrading enzymes and will address outstanding engineering 
challenges for plastic-degrading enzymes. The review provides
Enhancing enzymes through evolution3
a holistic overview of the field, evaluating recent directed evo-
lution studies of plastic hydrolases, and discusses opportuni-
ties, gaps, and future approaches in the following sections: (i) 
limitations of current plastic-degrading enzymes; (ii) searching 
for the optimal starting point for directed evolution; (iii) 
successful directed evolution of plastic degrading enzymes; (iv) 
advances in methods that will accelerate directed evolution of 
plastic-degrading enzymes; and (v) future perspectives. 
Limitations to current plastic-degrading 
enzyme engineering 
The potential for utilising enzymes in plastic recycling has 
started to emerge over the last decade. In 2005, cutinases 
were the first enzymes discovered to hydrolyse PET (
Müller 
et al. 2005). To date, the most active and industrially 
suitable enzyme for PET degradation is an engineered 
variant of a cutinase isolated from a leaf-branch compost 
metagenome (LCC) in 2012 (Sulaiman et al.2012). Additional 
enzymes with PETase activity have been discovered since, 
including a PETase recently isolated from the bacterium 
Ideonella sakaiensis (IsPETase) (
Yoshida et al. 2016). For the 
consideration of such enzymes in industrial applications, it is 
essential to assess crucial parameters that affect the scalability 
of the enzymatic PET degradation process. These parameters 
include: i) PET crystallinity, ii) surface exchange, iii) reaction 
temperature, iv) enzymatic efficiency, v) PET concentration, 
vi) PET depolymerisation yield, vii) product composition, and 
viii) enzyme expression yields (
Arnal et al. 2023). Considering 
these parameters, the scalability of engineered variants of 
IsPETase (FAST-PETase and HotPETase) is limited by the 
comparatively low depolymerisation rates compared to that 
observed for an engineered variant of LCC (LCC
ICCG)t h a t 
converts PET into the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) 
and ethylene glycol (EG) to 98% completion in 24 hours, or 
PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y, a variant of a thermophilic PET hydrolase 
derived from a compost metagenome that converts PET to 
80% completion in the same time frame (
Arnal et al. 2023). 
Despite these promising candidates, further engineering of 
existing enzymes is required to enhance their scalability and 
efficiency for industrial use. 
Although rational protein engineering, sometimes in combi-
nation with directed evolution, has been successfully applied 
to PET hydrolases (PETases) ( Fig. 1), there is still work to 
be done to improve these enzymes further towards industri-
ally applicable enzymes. Notably, most research efforts have 
predominantly focused on enhancing their enzymatic activity 
and thermal stability, while aspects such as protein solubility, 
substrate specificity, pH adaptation, and solvent tolerance 
have received limited attention. Additionally, concerns have 
arisen regarding issues of (enzyme) concentration dependence 
(
Avilan et al. 2023), or product inhibition ( Wei et al. 2016), 
and the selectivity of certain enzymes, which mainly target 
amorphous rather than highly crystalline components when 
used for post-consumer plastics (
Mueller 2006). 
Rational protein engineering faces limitations due to its low 
experimental throughput of engineered variants and often 
high failure rate. It often focuses on residues that are near 
the catalytic or binding site, while neglecting distal mutations, 
despite their potential in protein engineering (
Wilding et al. 
2019). For PETase engineering, rational design is hindered 
by the absence of any crystallographic structure with a 
Figure 1. The arrows show the fold-improvement in catalytic activity 
(compared to the wildtype sequence unless otherwise stated) and 
melting temperature changes of some engineered PET hydrolases from 
directed evolution experiments - HotPETase ( Bell et al. 2022), 
DepoPETase (Shi et al. 2023), TS-ΔIsPETase (Pirillo et al. 2022), 
SR-PETase (Zurier and Goddard, 2023), IsPETaseTMK95N/F201I (Brott 
et al. 2021), FAST -PETase (ML approach) (Lu et al. 2022), 
LCC-S101N/F243T(Pirillo et al. 2023) 
fully occupied PET-substrate binding site ( Chen et al. 2018), 
although short PET analogues such as 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-
methyl terephthalate, HEMT) and p-nitrophenol (pNP) have 
been successfully co-crystallized with a catalytically inactive 
mutant of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis (IsPETase) 
(
Han et al. 2017). To overcome this, computational docking 
studies have been employed to model PET substrate-binding 
modes ( Austin et al. 2018, Son et al. 2019, Jerves et al. 
2021), resulting in multiple binding modes being observed 
(Pfaff et al. 2022). Joo et al. proposed a PET degradation 
mechanism based on a docking study using 2-hydroxyethyl-
(mono-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) 4 2-HE(MHET)4 (Joo 
et al. 2018). However, this has been critiqued by Wei et al. 
who argued that the stiff polymer chain can hardly fit into the 
suggested docking conformation of the distal subsites IIb and 
IIc (Wei et al. 2019, Seo et al. 2019). 
Notably, caution must be taken in interpreting the results 
of docking studies as the structures of short substrates bound 
to PETases do not represent the interaction of PETases with 
an extended PET chain and molecular dynamic simulations 
continue to give further insights in the molecular mechanism 
(
Aboelnga and Kalyaanamoorthy 2022, Falkenstein et al. 
2023). 
Directed evolution (DE) is often applied to engineer pro-
teins in a high throughput manner, bypassing the need for 
detailed structural information. However, structural data and 
mechanism-guided information can be instrumental in guid-
ing mutagenesis in semi-rational approaches (
Sun et al. 2019, 
Li et al. 2023). In a directed evolution experiment, a selective 
pressure is applied to a protein of interest with the aim 
to evolve beneficial properties. It has been used extensively 
for enhancing the activity, thermostability, solubility, solvent 
tolerance, and pH adaptation of biocatalysts with interest 
for industrial applications (
Sanchez and Ting 2020, Wang 
et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2023). It is not within the scope 
of this review to explore all the uses of DE in enzymology;
4Johoet al.
Figure 2. Overview of a directed evolution experiment for plastic-degrading enzymes consisting of 1) selection of a starting variant, 2) library generation, 
3) screening or selection, and 4) improvements to the targeted properties of the enzyme 
rather, we have focused on PET-degrading enzymes. Broad 
reviews of the field can be found elsewhere ( Zeymer and 
Hilvert 2018, Packer and Liu 2015, Wang et al. 2021). A 
classical DE experiment generally consists of 1) selection of a 
starting variant, 2) mutagenesis of the gene of interest to create 
a variant library, and 3) screening or selection for protein 
properties of interest, and 4) identification of variants that 
exhibit improvements to the targeted properties (
Fig. 2). 
The application of directed evolution to PET-degrading 
enzymes, however, faces specific challenges. One of the main 
hurdles is the necessity for efficient high-throughput screening 
methods, a requirement that becomes particularly demanding 
due to the complex and insoluble nature of plastics (
Zhu et al. 
2021). These characteristics of plastics often lead to precip-
itation and heterogeneous solutions, creating difficult assay 
conditions for effective screening ( Pirillo et al. 2021). How-
ever, there have been significant advancements in selection and 
screening methods, which are crucial for overcoming these 
challenges, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections. 
Methods of screening and selection for 
plastic-degrading enzymes 
Identifying a suitable screening or selection method is critical 
to the successful directed evolution of plastic-degrading 
enzymes. Screening-based methods analyse every enzyme for 
a biophysical or biochemical property of interest, whereas 
selection-based methods aim to extract only the variants 
that are improved within a library, often by linking traits to 
survival or sequence recovery rates. Recently, studies have 
explored higher throughput options for plastic-degrading 
enzymes (
Wei et al. 2022). Fig. 3 shows an overview of the 
screening and selecting methods based on increased order of 
throughput. 
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a cor-
nerstone in identifying PET degradation products, essential 
for understanding polymer hydrolysis ( Pirillo et al. 2021). 
However, its low throughput limits its utility in directed 
evolution (DE) studies. Ultra-high-performance liquid chro-
matography (UPLC) addresses this by offering a faster alter-
native, as demonstrated by 
Bell et al. (2022), who measured 
the catalytic activity of PET-degrading enzymes in just two 
minutes per measurement, analysing over 2000 variants in 
two days. While UPLC is advantageous for detailed post-
screening analysis, its throughput is still considered low for 
initial DE screenings. 
UV absorption-based assays, adaptable to microtiter plates, 
represent a leap towards higher throughput, enabling enzyme 
kinetics monitoring efficiently ( Zhong-Johnson et al. 2021). 
Microtiter plate-based assays have evolved to include a 
variety of techniques such as UV absorption, colorimetric, 
turbidimetric, titrimetric and fluorometric assays (Zhong-John-
son et al. 2021, Pfaff et al. 2021, Belisário-Ferrari et al. 2019, 
Pirillo et al. 2022), often utilising soluble substrate analogues 
for simplicity. The introduction of natural polyester substrates 
like PET and bis(2-hydroxylethyl) terephthalate) BHET has 
expanded these assays’ scope, despite challenges related to 
their insolubility. Notably, a colorimetric pH-based assay has 
been developed for PET nanoparticles and BHET degradation,
Enhancing enzymes through evolution5
Figure 3. Overview of screening and selecting methods applied to the engineering of plastic degrading enzymes. Growth selection is a method 
commonly used within directed evolution experiments and has been used to assess plastic degrading activity of microorganisms such as I. sakaiensis 
(
Y oshida et al. 2016) but has not yet been extensively used in engineering of PETases 
marking a significant advancement in DE experiments on 
enzymes such as IsPETase and LCC cutinases ( Pirillo et al. 
2022). 
Agar plate-based screening methods offer a high-throughput 
alternative for identifying plastic-degrading enzymes. These 
assays utilise substrates such as Impranil ® DLN, a polyester-
polyurethane dispersion which turns agar opaque and, 
upon hydrolysis by polyester hydrolases, forms a clear halo 
around the colony, indicating polyester degradation. This 
method’s simplicity and adaptability to various insoluble 
polyester substrates, like BHET, polycaprolactone (PCL), and 
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), make it invaluable for screening 
a wide range of enzymes (
Wang et al. 2022, Brott et al. 2021, 
Molitor et al. 2020). 
A recent study utilised high throughput mass spectrometry 
to screen for the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyamide (PA) 
enzymes using an immediate drop on demand technology 
(I.DOT) liquid handling systems coupled with open-port 
sampling interface-mass spectrometry (OPSI-MS) for high-
throughput screening (8–20 sec/sample) of PA6 and PA66 
hydrolysis by 6-aminohexanoate-oligomer endo-hydrolase 
(nylon hydrolase, NylC) (
Cahill et al. 2023). 
Alternatively, fluorescence-based screening methods such 
as fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and droplet 
sorting (FADS) significantly enhance the throughput of 
directed evolution studies. These methods utilise fluorescent 
probes to link enzyme activity to a selectable phenotype in 
large libraries, facilitating the rapid identification of variants 
with improved activity (
Alma’abadi et al. 2022, Mo et al. 
2018). For example, a FADS pipeline by Qiao et al. (2022) 
utilised fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) for high-throughput 
screening of PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes, 
showcasing the method’s potential for discovering novel 
PETases. 
Whole-cell biosensors that emit fluorescence signals upon 
detecting specific analytes have been developed, suitable for 
FACS-based selection. For instance,Bayer et al.(2022) created 
a whole-cell biosensor for detecting terephthalic acid (TPA) 
in vivo, indicating the presence of TPA by increased biolumi-
nescence. Similarly, 
Li et al. (2022) engineered a transcription 
factor to bind TPA and initiate the expression of a fluorescent 
reporter, demonstrating the potential for developing biosen-
sors for a range of plastics. 
In the context of expanding the toolkit for directed 
evolution, it’s noteworthy that growth selection techniques, 
although less commonly used due to their specificity for 
certain enzymes, have seen innovative applications ( Molina 
et al. 2022). These methods, which directly link the growth of
6Johoet al.
an organism to the activity of interest, represent a promising 
avenue for future exploration in DE studies of plastic-
degrading enzymes. 
Overall, the advances in high throughput techniques for 
especially PET-degrading enzymes has been immense. How-
ever, further methods easily applicable for various polyesters 
such as polyamides and polyurethanes need to be acquired 
to develop high throughput methods. The performance of 
current leading enzymes in PET degradation raises ques-
tions about the necessity for ultrahigh-throughput screening 
because they may have limited effectiveness in enhancing the 
activity of an already highly active protein. For example, the 
activity of the PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y variant showed an increase 
by about two-fold compared to LCCICCG (Pfaff et al. 2022). 
Identifying the best starting points for directed 
evolution of plastic-degrading enzymes 
The rapid discovery of potential plastic-degrading enzymes 
presents a challenge in selecting the optimal starting point for 
directed evolution (DE) experiments. The question of what 
constitutes the best initial enzyme for a successful DE experi-
ment has been raised (
Trudeauand Tawfik2019), highlighting 
the importance of protein evolvability, which depends on a 
protein’s tolerance to mutations and its capacity to develop 
new functions ( Tokuriki and Tawfik 2009). Existing PET-
degrading enzymes are generally categorised as either ther-
mophilic or mesophilic, with thermostable cutinases, such as 
LCC, being considered more industrially relevant (
Arnal et al. 
2023) and thus likely providing a better starting point for DE 
experiments. Ancestral enzymes, reconstructed through ances-
tral sequence reconstruction (ASR), offer another promis-
ing avenue due to their robustness and inherent evolvability 
(Spence et al.2021). This approach, combining ancestral start-
ing points with DE, remains largely unexplored in the realm of 
plastic-degrading enzymes. Given that ancestral proteins have 
shown higher promiscuity than their modern counterparts, 
utilising ancestral starting points for DE could potentially 
evolve promiscuous ancestors towards novel specificity for 
various plastics. An emerging method to identify suitable 
PET-degrading enzymes for DE leverages bioinformatics and 
machine learning. A recent study applied these techniques 
to mine 74 putative thermotolerant PET hydrolases from 
natural diversity, successfully identifying and characterising 
enzymes from seven distinct phylogenetic groups with PET 
hydrolysis activity (
Erickson et al. 2022). This approach not 
only expands the diversity of thermotolerant scaffolds for 
enzymatic PET deconstruction but also highlights the poten-
tial of bioinformatics and machine learning in uncovering 
novel biocatalysts. 
Directed evolution: Pioneering advances in 
plastic-degrading enzymes 
Directed evolution (DE) studies of plastic-degrading enzymes 
has had a particular focus on enhancing thermostability 
and catalytic activity (
Table 1). These efforts have yielded 
remarkable successes, as evidenced by several pioneering 
studies. For example, in a directed evolution study on 
IsPETase, 
Brott et al. (2021) screened 49 000 clones through 
a plate-clearing assay and identified a variant, IsPETase 
K95N/F201I. This variant exhibited a 5 ◦Ci n c r e a s ei n 
melting temperature and a 6 ◦C shift in optimal temperature, 
showcasing DE’s capability to significantly improve enzyme 
stability for industrial applications. In another study, 
Shi 
et al. (2023) screened a library of 10 000 clones generated 
by error-prone PCR, identifying ‘DepoPETase,’ a variant that 
not only exhibited a 23.3 ◦C higher melting temperature but 
also demonstrated a 1407-fold increase in product formation 
compared to the wild type. This variant, incorporating muta-
tions T88I/D186H/D220N/N233K/N246D/R260Y/S290P , 
highlighted the effectiveness of iterative rounds of DE in 
significantly improving enzyme performance. Interestingly, 
the D186H, N246D and N233K were noted in previous 
engineering studies with IsPETase (
Son et al. 2019, Son et al. 
2020, Lu et al. 2022). Finally, Wang et al. used IsPET ase 
and SbPETase (PET hydrolase from Schlegelella brevitalea 
sp. nov.) as starting genes for DNA shuffling and established 
a high-throughput screening method using a signal peptide 
PelB and colicin release protein Kil for PETase secretion 
and identified a variant, IsPETaseS139T with moderately 
increased activity (
Wang et al. 2022). 
The integration of rational and semi-rational design with 
directed evolution (DE) has markedly improved the develop-
ment of enzymes for plastic degradation. These approaches 
utilise computational predictions and targeted mutagenesis 
to efficiently evolve enzymes with enhanced properties ( Yu 
et al. 2022, Jochens and Bornscheuer, 2010). For instance, 
Bell et al. (2022) used protein stability prediction tools and 
NNK (N=C/T/G/A, K = G/T) degenerate primers to evolve 
a ‘HotPETase’ variant, achieving a significant increase in 
melting temperature to 82.5◦C. This effort involved screening 
over 2000 variants using an automated, high-throughput 
UPLC platform, showcasing the effective combination of com-
putational and experimental methods in enzyme evolution. 
Similarly, Pirillo et al. (2022, 2023) employed site-directed 
mutagenesis to target specific residues in IsPETase and LCC. 
Screening of 3000 clones of IsPETase using a colorimetric 
pH-based assay (phenol red) led to the identification of an 
enhanced IsPETase variant that had increased catalytic activ-
ity by 130% and thermostability by 4.9
◦C relative to wild-
type (Pirillo et al. 2022). In another study, a LCC variant with 
increased activity on PET microplastics and post-consumer 
PET was identified by a similar approach, demonstrating the 
potential of semi-rational design in DE (
Pirillo et al. 2023). 
These examples highlight the strategic use of semi-rational DE 
to design targeted libraries, however, the number of selected 
residues for site-directed mutagenesis needs to be balanced to 
maximise the likelihood of yielding beneficial mutations while 
remaining economically feasible to screen. 
Notably, examples of directed evolution targeting plastics 
other than PET are very limited. In 2013, an error-prone PCR 
mutagenesis library aimed to evolve polyhydroxy butyrate 
(PHB) depolymerase from Ralstonia pickettii T1 (
Tan et al. 
2013). The study failed to improve the activity for PHB 
degradation; despite an increase in activity for p-nitrophenyl 
butyrate (the substrate analogue used in the screening step), 
the activity towards PHB was 3.5-fold lower than that of 
the wildtype. Another recent study on a polyamidase (nylon-
depolymerizing enzyme) stands as a counterexample. In this 
study, 1700 variants generated via random mutagenesis were 
quickly screened for nylon-6 degradation, leading to the iden-
tification of an enzyme (NylCTSP27Q/F301L) that showed 
a 1.9-fold increase in catalytic activity (
Puetz et al. 2023). 
However, DE studies on other polyesters are still limited 
because of non-existent high throughput methods.

Figure 4. Example properties of plastic-degrading enzymes that can be engineered using directed evolution to improve current limitations 
Despite these advancements, the potential of DE extends 
beyond targeting catalytic activity and stability, particularly 
in addressing substrate specificity, enzyme solubility, and resis-
tance to product inhibition ( Fig. 4). For industrial use, a PET 
conversion rate exceeding 90% is preferred ( Arnal et al. 
2023). However, only cutinase LCC ICCG has achieved this 
level, often requiring pre-treatment due to the target of all PET 
hydrolases being amorphous PET. HotPETase, was evolved 
from a variant that can use amorphous PET as a substrate 
(ThermoPETase) and over multiple evolution rounds, it not 
only became more thermostable (T
m =8 2◦C) but it can 
also accept semi-crystalline post-consumer PET ( Bell et al. 
2022). Further advances in machine learning have allowed 
for predictions of substrate specificity across several protein 
families and could provide helpful for further DE studies on 
the substrate scope of plastic-degrading enzymes (
Goldman 
et al. 2022). 
Increasing the expression levels of current plastic-degrading 
enzymes significantly is necessary to meet the desirable 
amount (>20 g/L extracellular protein) for large-scale 
applications (
Arnal et al.2023), which highlights the potential 
of directed evolution approaches. The innovative use of 
split-GFP screening systems, as demonstrated with DuraPETase 
by Weigert et al. (2021), suggests a promising avenue for 
enhancing soluble protein expression by DE. This method 
revealed a direct correlation between increased protein yield 
and GFP expression, indicating its potential for identifying 
variants with improved solubility and expression levels, which 
are crucial for scaling up enzyme production for industrial 
applications. 
Efforts to minimise product inhibition or protein concen-
tration-dependent inhibition effects in PET hydrolases have 
been discussed in recent reviews ( Tournier et al. 2023, Zhu 
et al. 2021). Product inhibition concerns have been addressed 
by using PETase in conjugation with mono-hydroxyethyl 
terephthalic acid hydrolase (MHETase) and more recently 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHETase) which are both 
enzymes produced by I. sakaiensis to break down by products 
of PET hydrolysis into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol 
(
Knott et al. 2020, Li et al. 2023). Studies have shown that 
using a chimera of IsPETase and MHETase can increase rates 
of TPA production by approximately 7.5-fold ( Knott et al. 
2020), and using engineered BHETase linked to IsPET ase 
could lead to a 7-fold improvement in PET hydrolysis using a 
mechanism-guided approach (
Li et al.2023). Though directed 
evolution may not be able to directly improve these conjuga-
tive systems as a whole, it could be beneficial to shift a focus to 
target MHETase and BHETase to improve their properties to 
enhance the synergy with PETase, reducing product accumula-
tion that inhibits the catalytic efficiency of individual compo-
nents. In another approach, screening or selection of PETase-
MHETase (or PETase-BHETase) chimeras, for instance where 
a library of MHETases is conjugated with a highly active 
PETase, may identify improved conjugative systems. 
In summary, directed evolution has facilitated significant 
progress in the development of plastic-degrading enzymes, 
with notable advancements in thermostability and catalytic 
activity. However, the exploration of uncharted territories 
such as solubility, substrate specificity, and particularly the 
optimization of multi-enzyme systems to overcome product 
inhibition, offers promising avenues for future research. By 
leveraging DE to enhance the compatibility and efficiency 
of enzyme combinations, such as PETase and MHETase/B-
HETase, there is potential to significantly improve the indus-
trial viability of enzymatic plastic degradation processes, con-
tributing to more effective and sustainable solutions for man-
aging plastic waste. 
Concluding remarks and future perspectives 
Rational protein engineering has proven to be effective 
in enhancing specific features such as thermostability and 
activity. However, its true potential is unlocked through 
the complementary use of directed evolution, which enables 
the investigation of a much larger sequence space and has 
recently become more feasible to use due to advances in 
high-throughput screening and selection methods. Despite
Enhancing enzymes through evolution9
significant progress in the applicability of directed evolution 
to PETases, and numerous success cases, the field still requires 
the development of more efficient high-throughput screening 
and selection methods. Methods such as FACS and FADS 
show significant potential for the selection of desired plastic-
degrading enzymes from large libraries (
Qiao et al. 2022, 
Xu et al. 2023, Cribari et al. 2023), hence these may 
be used as starting points for novel methods to address 
the limitations within directed evolution. Alternatively, the 
integration of computational methods such as machine 
learning or ancestral sequence reconstruction into the directed 
evolution workflow can enhance efficiency through in silico 
screening (
Wittmann et al. 2021, Yang et al. 2019)a n d 
the creation of smarter, combinatorial libraries. Examples 
of this include the development of FAST-PETase through 
machine learning (
Lu et al. 2022) or the development 
of thermostable PETases utilising ancestral reconstruction 
(Joho et al. 2023). 
While directed evolution has been successfully applied to 
PETases, a recent shift towards the development of enzymes 
for alternative plastics is noted (Puetz et al.2023). This is espe-
cially important if the global plastics issue is to be addressed. 
While it is possible to re-engineer or modify enzymes towards 
new plastics through traditional directed evolution work-
flows, machine learning emerges as a more promising solu-
tion, as algorithms assess multiple enzymes against various 
substrates (
Goldman et al. 2022). 
It is possible that we are entering a golden era for high 
throughput directed evolution with promising emerging in 
vivoscreening methods (McLure et al.2022, Zeng et al.2020). 
This review mostly focused on classic directed evolution stud-
ies. Nonetheless, exciting advances have been made based on 
whole-cell protein sensors detecting TPA and various benzoic 
derivates. These advances, coupled with the directed evolution 
of plastic-degrading enzymes, hold the promise of moving the 
field towards a future where continuous evolution becomes 
the norm in developing more efficient enzymes (
Molina et al. 
2022, Bayer et al. 2022, Li et al. 2022).
