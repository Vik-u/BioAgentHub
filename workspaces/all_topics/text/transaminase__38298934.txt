Natural transaminase fusions for biocatalysis†
Luba Prout, a Helen C. Hailes b and John M. Ward *a
Biocatalytic approaches are used widely for the synthesis of amines from abundant or low cost starting
materials. This is a fast-developingﬁeld where novel enzymes and enzyme combinations emerge quickly
to enable the production of new and complex compounds. Natural multifunctional enzymes represent
a part of multi-step biosynthetic pathways that ensure a one-wayﬂux of reactants.In vivo, they confer
a selective advantage via increased reaction rates and chemical stability or prevention of toxicity from
reactive intermediates. Here we report the identiﬁcation and analysis of a natural transaminase fusion,
PP_2782, from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, as well as three of its thermophilic homologs from
Thermaerobacter marianensis, Thermaerobacter subterraneus, and Thermincola ferriacetica. Both the
fusions and their truncated transaminase-only derivatives showed good activity with unsubstituted
aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and amines, as well as with a range ofa-keto acids, and
L-alanine, L-
glutamate, and L-glutamine. Through structural similarity, the fused domain was recognised as the acyl-
[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase that aﬀects reductive chain release. These natural transaminase fusions
could have a great potential for industrial applications.
Introduction
Manufacturing amine-containing pharmaceuticals and indus-
trially importantne chemicals is essential for the production
of a range of bioactive compounds. To circumvent challenges
associated with chemical methods used for their production,
enzymatic routes are being increasingly employed and devel-
oped as an alternative.
1–8 A large number of natural biological
catalysts representing a wide range of functionalities have been
discovered and used for that purpose. Moreover, the accelera-
tion of biocatalytic approaches has led to the development of
multi-step enzyme cascades and de novo pathway
engineering.
9–15 These provide the means for generating
complex compounds from abundant or cheap simple starting
materials and are of increasing interest. However, in nature,
enzymes have evolved to function together with other enzymes
in specic environments, meaning that their isolation and use
in non-native environments may reduce their eﬃciency. Typical
issues include low yields due to unfavourable reaction equi-
libria, loss of intermediates to other cellular enzymes, toxicities,
or substrate, product, or intermediate eﬄux inin vivosystems.
The presence of multifunctional enzymes, which enable the
metabolic channelling and sequestration of intermediates,
suggests there is an evolutionary advantage to these systems.
16,17
Such enzymes are oen found within gene clusters or operons
that are responsible for the synthesis of complex molecules,
such as antibiotics or secondary metabolites.
18,19 These multi-
functional catalysts are oen very eﬃcient, having had the
opportunity to evolve and improve over time.
Following our interest in transaminases (TAms), in prelimi-
nary studies, an open reading frame in thePseudomonas putida
KT2440 genome, specically at locus PP_2782 (NCBI GenBank
ref.: AAN68390.1, UniProt: Q88J67_PSEPK), was identied as
encoding a TAm-like enzyme. The gene was unusually long
compared to other known TAms and was found to contain
a NAD(P)-binding region, suggesting a TAm-fused enzyme.
Importantly, this fusion, which was termedPpKTFusion, was
found to also be located within a type II FAS/PKS gene cluster
proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of a secondary
metabolite,
20 (Fig. 1). Although previous studies could not
determine the activity of the KT2440 PP_2777-PP_2787 loci,20–22
analogous gene clusters were identied in Pseudomonas uo-
rescens MC07,23 a forest soil metagenome DNA fragment, 22
Pseudomonas sp. SWI3624 and Pseudomonas koreensis.25 In those

studies, the clusters were shown to play a pivotal role in the
hosts' ability to exhibit antagonistic activity against either
fungi23 or other bacteria.24,25
Based on this biological activity, a new family of bacterial
tetrahydropyridine alkaloids, koreenceines A to D (Fig. 2), was
isolated fromP. koreensis.
25 Importantly, a transposon insertion
in the PP_2782 homolog genes resulted in the complete loss of
the organisms' antagonistic activity.
24,25
Five- and six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic
compounds are common in nature, with many exhibiting
important pharmacological properties. In recent years,
increasing numbers of polyketide-derived piperidine alkaloids
have been discovered in microorganisms, particularly in acti-
nomycetes.
26,27 Bacteria have been shown to utilise them for
growth, colony di ﬀerentiation, defence, pathogenicity, and
quorum sensing.26 Many of these compounds also have antag-
onistic biological activities.28 Generally, in thiotemplate-based
assembly lines, TAms are rare but may be present either as
integrated domains within large multi-modular enzymes or as
independent tailoring catalysts.
29–31 Until recently, they were
only known to occur in pathways associated with microcystins,
iturins, and prodigiosins.
29 However, a more recent analysis
found that reductive chain release that is followed by a reductive
transamination is a conserved mechanism in actinobacterial
polyketide alkaloid biosynthesis.
31,32 Gene clusters responsible
for the synthesis of these alkaloids in actinomycetes comprise
modular type I PKS and several core independent tailoring
enzymes, including oxidoreductases, cyclases and a TAm.
31 So
far, the TAms identied were monofunctional enzymes that
perform the conversion of a polyketide aldehyde to an
amine.
28,32
Generally, very few natural bifunctional TAm enzymes have
been characterised and no thermophilic TAm fusions have
previously been reported.5,33,34 In this work, the analysis and
characterisation of a putative TAm-long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier-
protein] reductase fusion PP_2782 (PpKTFusion) and three of its
thermophilic homologs (Tmar_2123 ( TmFusion), Thesu-
DRAFT_00745 ( TsFusion), and Tfer_2018 ( TfFusion), from
Thermaerobacter marianensis, Thermaerobacter subterraneus, and
Thermincola ferriacetica, respectively) is described. The enzymes
were cloned, truncated to their TAm domain, expressed, and
tested in vitro. Results of the TAm activity screens, which were
investigated qualitatively through colorimetric assays and
quantitatively via reaction conversions, are presented. A more
detailed account of the activity ofPpKTFusion and TfFusion
(and their truncated TAm derivatives) at diﬀerent pH levels,
temperatures, amine donor and substrate concentrations, and
with diﬀerent solvents is also described.
Results and discussion
PpKTFusion sequence analysis
Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTP) analysis
was performed to identify and categorisePpKTFusion homologs
in order to investigate the TAm homology, relatedness within
this fusion group, boundaries of the TAm domain, and to infer
enzyme function of the partner protein. The search returned
several groups of related sequences, which could be split into
three tiers (Table S1, ESI†). Sequence length variability between
entries prompted the use of a NCBI Conserved Domains tool,
which identied two functional motifs withinPpKTFusion – (a)
an AAT_I superfamily domain (PLP-dependent aspartate TAm
(fold type I)), and (b) a COG5322 superfamily domain (predicted
amino acid dehydrogenase) (Table S2, ESI†). Multiple sequence
alignments (MSA) of thePpKTFusion N- and C-terminal domain
BLASTP results (limited to entries with single functional motifs)
were further employed to determine boundaries of the two
domains (Fig. 3). Based on these results, the N-terminal
domain, between residues 1– 526, was assigned as the TAm
part, (Fig. 3(A)); the C-terminal domain between residues 563–
959 (397 aa) was assigned the dehydrogenase/reductase part,
(Fig. 3(B)); and residues between 527 and 562 (36 aa) were
proposed to be the linker peptide.
Gene cluster
Screening genomes of PpKTFusion homologs showed that
similar gene clusters (to PP_2777-PP_2787) were also present in
many other organisms. Overall, 230 homologs with comparable
gene clusters were identied (Fig. S1, ESI†). Most of these
clusters were present inGammaproteobacteria (predominantly
in Pseudomonas and Xenorhabdus genera), two in Betaproteo-
bacteria, and 23 inActinobacteria (Streptomyces spp.), (Table 1).
PpKTFusion phylogenetic analysis
To elucidate the enzyme's evolutionary pathway, phylogenetic
analysis of thePpKTFusion sequence was performed. Identi-
cation of orthologs is useful because enzyme function tends to
be conserved in all species.
35 A phylogenetic tree, constructed
using PpKTFusion orthologs, demonstrated that, aside from
Pseudomonas spp., the most closely related homologs were
found inStreptomyces spp. (clade 1, Fig. 4).

Paper RSC Advances
Several orthologs were also found in extremophiles, (clade 2,
Fig. 4), indicating a broad distribution of this type of fusion
enzyme. Investigation of gene neighbourhoods showed that
more distant orthologs, including those in extremophiles, were
located within diﬀerent types of gene clusters (Table S4, ESI†).
Further analysis of the genomes of the three recruited ther-
mophiles (as detailed below) using the antiSMASH online tool
revealed the presence of NRP/PKS-type gene clusters likely
encoding a prodiginine family-type alkaloid (Table S5, ESI†).
Thermophilic homologs
Given the desirability for potential applications, three thermo-
philic TAm fusion homologs – Tmar_2123 from Thermaer-
obacter marianensis DSM 12885 (NCBI GenBank reference:
ADU52204.1/WP_013496504.1) ( TmFusion), Thesu-
DRAFT_00745 from Thermaerobacter subterraneus DSM 13965
(NCBI GenBank reference: EKP95021.1/WP_006903020.1)
(TsFusion), and Tfer_2018 fromThermincola ferriaceticaZ-0001
(NCBI GenBank reference: KNZ69380.1/WP_052218203.1)
(TfFusion) – were selected for further study.TmFusion, TsFu-
sion, TfFusion, andPpKTFusion were aligned, and sequences of
the thermophilic enzymes were divided into N- and C-terminal
sections, in line with domain boundaries in PpKTFusion
(Fig. S2, Tables S6 and S7, ESI†). BLASTP ofTmFusion, TsFu-
sion, and TfFusion identied only a small number (1– 10) of
close homologs for each of the enzymes (Table S8, ESI †),
providing little insight into their background. Overall, the
distribution of the returned fusion-like di-domain entries
showed a substantial overlap withPpKTFusion BLASTP results.
Structural homologs
Identication of structural homologs can also help determine
the function and substrate range for the enzyme under the
investigation, since many structurally similar enzymes

(regardless of whether their primary sequences are homologous
or not) tend to exhibit similar function.36
N-terminal domain homologs.Top entries included class-III
TAms (EC 2.6.1) with sequence coverage >91%, (Tables S9 and
S10, ESI†), supporting the proposition that the N-terminal
domain in PpKTFusion, TmFusion, TsFusion, and TfFusion
enzymes was likely a PLP-dependent TAm. Among the top
entries for thePpKTFusion was a bifunctional enzyme fusion–
diaminopelargonic acid TAm-dethiobiotin synthetase (DAPA
AT-DTBS) from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB: 4A0R), (Table S9,
ESI†). DAPA AT (TAm) and DTBS (dethiobiotin synthetase)
domains catalyse the second and third steps of a four-step
biotin biosynthesis pathway. The monocistronic transcript
producing DAPA AT-DTBS fusion originates from prokaryotic
ancestor genes but is only found in plants and fungi.
17 In
bacteria, the same reactions are performed by separately enco-
ded enzymes.
37 In contrast toPpKTFusion, the TAm domain in
DAPA AT-DTBS fusion is positioned at the C-terminal.
For TmFusion, TsFusion, andTfFusion, one of the top struc-
tural homologs is PigE (PDB: 4PPM)– an ACOAT-like enzyme
(Table S10, ESI†). This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of
prodigiosin (red pigment) and, until recently, it was proposed to
be a monofunctional enzyme responsible for the transamination
of (S)-3-acetyloctanal.
38 However, in light of the emergence of the
AAR crystal structure (PDB: 6JZU), the function of PigE was
reviewed and is now thought to include the reduction of a thio-
ester intermediate to an aldehyde ((S)-3-acetyloctanal) as well as
its subsequent transamination.39–41 Unlike in TmFusion, TsFu-
sion, andTfFusion enzymes, the PigE TAm domain is located at
the C-terminal of the fusion, suggesting convergent evolution.
Another key structural homolog for thermophilic fusions is
at h e r m o s t a b l eT A mu-TATR (PDB: 6IO1). It was proposed that at
high temperatures the stability of theu-TATR active site struc-
ture is preserved by the presence of a high mobility loop, which
counteracts the eﬀect of thermal perturbation.
42
Homologs CrmG (PDB: 5DDW) and YgjG (PDB: 5H7D) were
among the top-ranking entries for bothPpKTFusion and the
thermophilic set, indicating high structural similarity between
all four enzymes under investigation, (see Fig. 5). CrmG is located
within the caerulomycin A biosynthetic pathway, which is
ah y b r i dP K Sa n dN R P Ss y s t e m .
43 Caerulomycin A, known to be
present inStreptomyces caeruleusand Actinoalloteichus cyanogri-
seus WH1-2216-6, has been found to have antimicrobial and
cytotoxic properties and is thus of great interest to the biomed-
ical eld. Another compound with a similar structure, collismy-
cin A, was identied in Streptomyces spp.
44 Monofunctional
CrmG is responsible for the conversion of an aldehyde attached
to a 2,2
0 -bipyridyl ring core structure to an amine, favouringL-
glutamate andL-glutamine as amine donors.43 Finally, the YgjG
homolog is fromEscherichia coli. The conformation of its active
site entrance is smaller and more hydrophobic compared to
other class III TAms, explaining the preference for aliphatic
diamine substrates.
45 Previous analysis of the solved crystal
structure of PigE C-terminal TAm domain also revealed its rela-
tively small and hydrophobic active site.
46 Although PpKTFusion
substrates for this study were initially proposed based on the
gene cluster the enzyme was found in, the same range of
compounds was extended to all four enzymes based on their
structural similarity and analogy to PigE and YgjG.
C-terminal domain homologs. A long-chain acyl-[acyl-
carrier-protein] reductase (AAR, PDB: 6JZU) from Synecho-
coccus elongatus PCC 7942 was the only close match (at >75%
residue alignment/coverage) to the PpKTFusion, TmFusion,
TsFusion, andTfFusion C-terminal region (Fig. 5, Tables S9 and
S11, ESI†). Aer a structural alignment, the AAR active site
catalytic residue C294
47 was mapped onto C910, C909, C815,
and C824 in thePpKTFusion, TmFusion, TsFusion, and TfFu-
sion C-terminal domain, respectively, (Table S12, ESI†). The
structural alignment further revealed that the AAR region con-
taining a highly conserved sequence
162GATGDIG168 for the
NADP(H) binding (in the form GX(1-3)GX(1-3)G) was comparable
in all four enzymes under the investigation (Table S12, ESI†).
AAR (PDB: 6JZU) is responsible for the conversion of a long
chain fatty acyl-ACP/fatty acyl-CoA to the corresponding alde-
hyde.
47 The conversion proceedsvia a ‘ping-pong’ mechanism
through an acyl-enzyme intermediate as the acyl group cova-
lently binds to C294 releasing ACP/CoA.
47–49 In the subsequent
step NADPH donates a hydride which enables release of the
aldehyde from the enzyme.47,49 Interestingly, the PpKTFusion,
TmFusion, TsFusion, andTfFusion C-terminal domain primary
sequence also aligned with the N-terminal domain of PigE.
Expression of recombinant enzymes
For analysis in vitro, PpKTFusion, TmFusion, TsFusion, and
TfFusion were cloned into pET-28a(+), truncated to what was

determined to be their TAm domain and expressed inE. coli
BL21(DE3) or Rosetta 2(DE3) with a N-terminal His 6-tag
(Fig. S5– S8, ESI†). Enzymes were puried using immobilised
metal aﬃnity chromatography and then tested qualitatively
using colorimetric assays and quantitatively via conversions
determined by analytical HPLC.
Transaminase activity screening
Colorimetric screening. To establish transaminase activity,
compounds1–43 were used. The colorimetric assays employed 2-
(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine 44 as an amine donor 50 and
aliphatic aldehydes and ketones as substrates. Initial results sup-
ported the in silico analysis that fusions and their truncated

background (if present) was subtracted from the reactions. Values shown are the mean of two measurements, with SD < 10%.

derivatives possess transami nase activity. All enzyme sets
(PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm, TmFusion/TmTAm, TsFusion/TsTAm,
and TfFusion/TfTAm) showed good activity with a range ofa-keto
acid acceptors as well as with linear and unsubstituted aromatic
aldehydes (Fig. 6(A)), suggesting such compounds could be among

1,2-cyclohexanedione10, was detected with ketones, (Fig. 6(A)).
Variation in the range of compounds accepted byTmFusion/
TmTAm and TsFusion/TsTAm, and TfFusion/TfTAm and
PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm see assays with 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate19,
and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate18, (Fig. 6(A)), highlighted that the
native substrates between these enzyme groups likely diﬀer
slightly. Although colorimetric assays were used for qualitative
assessment, some additional inferences could also be made.
Despite the di ﬀerence in the concentration used between
PpKTFusion andPpKTTAm (0.94× 10
−7 Ma n d1 . 6 6× 10−7 M),
the colour intensity in samples was not substantially dissimilar
aer 18 hours when using pyruvate as a substrate (Fig. S10, ESI†).
Consequently, it was proposed that the diﬀerence in colorimetric
readout between PpKTFusion and PpKTTAm in assays with 2-
ketobutyrate 17, 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate19, oxaloacetate21,a n d
butanal 14, (Fig. 6(A)), was due to structural diﬀerences between
the fusion and its truncated derivative. In the case ofPpKTFusion
(in samples with weaker colour intensity), the cited substrates
could have had a more restricted access to the active site due to
the presence of the C-terminal domain. Notably, unlike
PpKTTAm, where results were analogous,PpKTFusion showed
a better activity with hexanal compared to butanal, (Fig. 6(A)).
Interestingly, such diﬀerences were not observed with thermo-
philic fusions and their truncated derivatives.
Use of HPLC analysis.To determine the type and the range of
amine donors that could be utilised by the enzymes, 3-phenyl-
propionaldehyde 13 (as identied by colorimetric assays) was
selected for experiments using HPLC analysis. As with the
colorimetric assays, fusions and truncated TAms had a nar-
rower substrate range compared to the CvTAm control, and
mainly showed a preference for
L-glutamate 36, L-glutamine 42,
L-alanine 35, and amines with aliphatic moieties, (Fig. 6(B)).
Compared toPpKTFusion/PpKTTAm, the thermophilic enzymes
accepted a broader range of amines, showing additional or
greater activity with 6-aminohexanoic acid29, 2-aminoheptane
26, 2-phenylethan-1-amine27, benzylamine31, 4-phenylbutan-
2-amine 28 (all sets) and benzylamine31,
L-glutamate 36, andL-
glutamine 42 (TfFusion/TfTAm, TsFusion/TsTAm). Interestingly,
and unlike PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm, the thermophilic enzyme
sets showed greater preference forL-glutamate 36 (similarly to
PigE). Based on the range of accepted substrates, all tested
fusions were proposed to be class III TAms.
Characterisation ofPpKTFusion, TfFusion and their
truncated derivativesPpKTTAm, TfTAm
The eﬀect of pH, temperature, and co-solvent as well as the
concentration of amine donor and substrate were investigated
to establish the scope ofPpKTFusion/PpKTTAm and TfFusion/
TfTAm transaminase activity. All assays employed 36 as an
amine donor and13 as the substrate/amine acceptor.
pH eﬀect. For both sets PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm and TfFu-
sion/TfTAm, enzyme activity was detected across a wide pH
range. For PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm, greater product yield was
observed at pH 8, whereas for TfFusion/TfTAm, greater
conversions were at pH 7, (Fig. 7(A)). For all enzymes, gradual
reduction in conversion levels was noted at higher (>pH 8) and
lower (<pH 7) pH, with a complete decline at pH 4, (Fig. 7(A)).
Eﬀect of the reaction temperature. For PpKTFusion and
PpKTTAm, an increase in conversion levels was observed at
temperatures up to and including 50 °C, (Fig. 7(B)). At higher
temperatures (>50 °C), there was a drop in performance for both
enzymes, probably due to enzyme denaturation. In comparison,
TfFusion showed an increase in conversion levels at tempera-
tures up to and including 70 °C, (Fig. 7(B)). ForTfTAm, an
increase in conversion levels was observed at temperatures of
up to 50 °C, which was followed by a levelling-oﬀ between 50
and 70 °C, (Fig. 7(B)). SubjectingTfFusion to thermal treatment
resulted in a decrease in residual activity to approx. 30% at
60 °C and 40% at 70 °C of the initial activity aer two hours.
Even without optimisation, this is a promising starting point,
particularly given the absence of direct comparisons in the
literature, (Fig. S11, ESI†).
Solvent eﬀects. DMSO and ethanol are frequently added to
enzyme assays for substrate solubilisation. To investigate solvent
tolerance, a range of concentrations of each co-solvent was tested.
For bothPpKTFusion andPpKTTAm, enzyme activity was detected
over a range of ethanol concentrations, withPpKTTAm showing
a slight increase in conversions at greater ethanol concentrations
(tested in combination with 10% v v
−1 DMSO), (Fig. 7(C)). In
contrast, bothTfFusion andTfTAm showed a downward trend in
conversion levels at >10% v v−1 of ethanol, (Fig. 7(C)).
With DMSO only, bothPpKTFusion and PpKTTAm showed
a gradual reduction in conversions with increasing solvent
concentration, (Fig. 7(D)). ForTfFusion, a gradual decrease in
product yield was observed at >20% DMSO v.v
−1. Interestingly,
for TfTAm the increase in DMSO concentration had only
a marginal eﬀect on performance, (Fig. 7(D)). Overall, these
results indicated that ethanol, if suitable, would be a better co-
solvent for PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm, and DMSO would work
better withTfFusion/TfTAm.
Amine donor concentration eﬀect. Varying the concentra-
tion of36 between 0.5 and 10 equivalents relative to13 had little
eﬀect on the activity ofPpKTFusion, (Fig. 7(E)). ForPpKTTAm,
a slight but gradual increase in conversions was observed at
concentrations >10 mM but <75 mM (>1, but <7.5 equivalents),
and a slight decrease– at >75 mM. The diﬀerence between the
enzymes is thought to be due to the presence of the C-terminal
domain. For TfFusion/TfTAm, an increase in conversions was
noted at up to 50 mM of36 (0.5– 5 equiv.); above that (5– 10
equiv.) the activity remained comparatively unchanged,
appearing to be saturating and producing no inhibition.
Substrate concentration eﬀect. An increase in PpKTFusion

higher substrate concentrations (>25 mM) was indicative of
substrate inhibition. This was validated by tting data to
substrate inhibition equations using non-linear regression
analysis, which showed apparent enzyme inhibition even at
micromolar substrate concentrations, (Table 2, Fig. S13, ESI†).
In contrast, a rapid increase inTfFusion performance was
observed at substrate concentrations of up to 25 mM; this was
followed by a more gradual improvement between 25 and
75 mM, (Fig. 7(F)). ForTfTAm, a gradual increase in activity was
observed between 5 and 75 mM. At >75 mM, a slight drop in
activity was noted for both enzymes, suggesting inhibition at
greater concentrations (Fig. 7(F)). This, again, was supported by
tting data (Table 2, Fig. S13, ESI†).
Interestingly, following the truncation of PpKTFusion,
K
app
m , kapp
cat , and Vapp
max values for 36 increased, exhibiting lower
aﬃnity towards the amine donor but greater enzyme activity
(Table 2). For13, parameters could not be determined due to
the apparent enzyme inhibition. In contrast, following the
truncation of TfFusion, k
app
cat values towards both 36 and 13
dropped by approx. two-fold, (Table 2). While theKapp
m value for
36 decreased, it increased for 13, indicating an improved
aﬃnity towards the amine donor but a decreased a ﬃnity
towards the acceptor, (Table 2). The changes were most likely
due to the structural modication or absence of the C-terminal
domain, which may have a role in amine donor and substrate
binding, or possibly a combination of both.
Comparison of enzyme parameters
On the whole,k
cat values of PpKTFusion/PpKTTAm and TfFu-

mesophilic13,51 and thermophilic34,52 TAms, respectively, but
comparable to other structurally similar enzymes, (Table 3).
This is unsurprising, considering that the main role of
PpKTFusion (and potentially TfFusion as well) is to facilitate
the production of a secondary metabolitein vivo
20,23–25 – where
large quantities of the compound would likely be toxic to the
cell. The two exceptions were the class III TAm (PDB: 3HMU),
and the plant bifunctional DAPA AT-DTBS homolog. For the
latter, k
cat was one order of magnitude lower than that of other
enzymes, but in line with physiological requirementsin vivo,17
whereas for the former, kcat was one order of magnitude
greater (Table 3). Although structurally similar to 3FCR, 3HMU
was found to have diﬀerent residues in its active site which,
presumably, enhance its catalytic activity.
53 Notably, thekcat of
the thermophilic homolog u-TATR for pyruvate was compa-
rable to that of TfTAm. For (S)-MBA, the value was approx.
three- and six-fold greater relative to TfFusion and TfTAm,
respectively. However, these parameters were determined at
60 °C, where the values were two- (for pyruvate) and three- (for
(S)-MBA) fold greater than at 37 °C.
54
Comparison of enzyme parameters
Although the activity of the C-terminal domains in fusions was
not determined here, given their close structural similarity to
AAR (PDB: 6JZU), their function is likely to be that of the AAR.
The C-terminal domains ofPpKTFusion, TmFusion, TsFusion,
and TfFusion were tested exhaustively for alcohol dehydroge-
nase activity with negative results. A homologous enzyme KecF
(NCBI GenBank reference: WP_077570921.1; 80% ID/99% QC
relative toPpKTFusion) was proposed to perform a reduction of
an ACP-polyketide intermediate to a polyketide aldehyde, with
a subsequent transamination of the polyketide aldehyde to an
amine.
25 The suggestion was based on the analysis of an alka-
loid generated via the homologous pathway in P. koreensis,25
(see Fig. 2). Due to the high sequence similarity between
PpKTFusion and KecF, enzyme function as well as substrate
types are likely to be comparable (though KecF activity was not
investigated in vitro ). Importantly, PigE function was also
recently reviewed, which led to the revision of MAP biosynthesis
in the prodigiosin pathway.
41 PigE (NCBI GenBank reference:
WP_015376883.1), both a structural and primary sequence
homolog with the opposite domain conguration (see above), is
also thought to have a dual AAR-TAm function.41
Additional support for the TAm-AAR activity is aﬀorded by
the characterisation of PtTAmH from Pseudoalteromonas tuni-
cata. PtTAmH is a di-domain enzyme with homology to all four
fusions in this work: at 28– 32% ID/89– 98% QC. During the
course of this work,PtTAmH was found to be able to carry out
the thioester reduction on ACP with subsequent transamination
of aliphatic aldehyde substrates (Fig. 8). Importantly, the
investigation also highlighted the preference of the enzyme's
TAm domain for C
12 aldehyde substrates.55

Conclusions
The work presented herein provides analysis and the rst
known detailed account of the activity of four TAm fusions
(from P. putidaKT2440, and its thermophilic homologs fromT.
marianensis, T. subterraneusand T. ferriacetica) of this kind. All
four enzymes showed preference for long/aliphatic aldehydes
and a number of a-keto acids. The range of amine donors
accepted was diﬀerent between the enzyme sets.PpKTFusion
and its truncated derivativePpKTTAm favoured the acceptance
of
L-alanine 35, L-glutamate 36, andL-glutamine 42 amino acids.
In contrast, the thermophilic enzymes also accepted
aliphatic and aromatic non-amino acid compounds. Slight
variation in substrate preference placedPpKTFusion/PpKTTAm
and TfFusion/TfTAm, and TmFusion/TmTAm and TsFusion/
TsTAm, in separate groups, and facilitated the selection of
a thermophilic homolog for additional characterisation. A more
detailed analysis of PpKTfusion and the truncated PpKTTAm
indicated that activity of both enzymes was mostly comparable
but, at certain parameters, including higher substrate/amine
donor concentrations, or higher temperature, the activity of
PpKTTAm was enhanced – most likely owing to structural
diﬀerences. However, truncation also aﬀected enzyme aﬃnity
towards the amine donor
L-glutamate 36. Due to the apparent
enzyme inhibition by 3-phenylpropionaldehyde13,ad i ﬀerent
substrate is recommended for further studies.
A more detailed analysis ofTfFusion andTfTAm transaminase
activity has revealed the enzymes' remarkable ability to operate at
elevated temperatures with catalytic rates approximately 13- and
6-fold greater than those ofPpKTfusion andPpKTTAm, respec-
tively. However, truncation had an overall negative impact on
enzyme activity, resulting in a reduction in the turnover number
as well as a decreased aﬃnity towards the aldehyde substrate.
Currently, there are very few characterised thermophilic
TAms,
5,33,34 and none are known to possess bifunctional activity.
Having established the transaminase activity, the future potential
of these enzymes is signicant. The enzymes could also be uti-
lised for the conversion of activated fatty acids to amines, or more
complex natural products.
55 Additionally, requirement for the
eﬃcient alcohol to amine conversion could necessitate the
evolution (or replacement) of the fusion C-terminal domain to
acquire a carbonyl reductase/dehydrogenase activity. Due to their
domain structure, long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reduc-
tases are thought to be potentially related to the short-chain
dehydrogenase/reductase family; and, as the oxidoreductase
scaﬀold is already in place, this would seem to be a plausible
evolutionary route. The use of natural, and synthetic, fusions is
a promising approach to improving existing biocatalytic routes
for the production of industrially important bioactive molecules.
