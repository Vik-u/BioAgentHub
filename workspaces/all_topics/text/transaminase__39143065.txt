Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), exempliﬁed by osimertinib, have demonstrated promising clinical efﬁcacy in
the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our previous work has identiﬁed ASK120067 as a novel third-generation EGFR
TKI with remarkable antitumor effects that has undergone New Drug Application (NDA) submission in China. Despite substantial
progress, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs remains a signiﬁcant challenge, impeding the long-term effectiveness of therapeutic
approaches. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing high-throughput proteomics analysis on
established TKI-resistant tumor models, and found a notable upregulation of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1)
expression in both osimertinib- and ASK120067-resistant tumors compared with the parental TKI-sensitive NSCLC tumors. Genetic
depletion or pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 impaired the growth of resistant cells and partially re-sensitized tumor cells to
EGFR TKIs. Mechanistically, upregulated BCAT1 in resistant cells reprogrammed branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism and
promoted alpha ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent demethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27) and subsequent transcriptional
derepression of glycolysis-related genes, thereby enhancing glycolysis and promoting tumor progression. Moreover, we identiﬁed
WQQ-345 as a novel BCAT1 inhibitor exhibiting antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo against TKI-resistant lung cancer with
high BCAT1 expression. In summary, our study highlighted the crucial role of BCAT1 in mediating resistance to third-generation
EGFR-TKIs through epigenetic activation of glycolysis in NSCLC, thereby supporting BCAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the
treatment of TKI-resistant NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION
Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been considered the primary cause of
treatment failure and cancer recurrence in patients with EGFR-
mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among multiple
resistance mechanisms, the secondary mutation T790M in EGFR
exon 20 is recognized as the most prevalent cause of acquired
resistance to ﬁrst- and second-generation EGFR TKIs.
1 Several
third-generation EGFR TKIs are designed to irreversibly target
EGFR with the T790M resistance mutation as well as EGFR
activating mutations. Among them, osimertinib (AZD9291) stands
out as a representative compound widely approved for the
standard second-line therapy of NSCLC with EGFR T790M
mutation and ﬁrst-line treatment in NSCLC with EGFR activating
mutations.
2 Additionally, ASK120067 is a novel third-generation
EGFR TKI with promising antitumor efﬁcacy reported by our team
and is currently undergoing the New Drug Application (NDA)
submission in China.3 Despite the marked preclinical and clinical
efﬁcacy of third-generation EGFR TKIs, acquired resistance
inevitably develops. Various mechanisms have been reported,
including EGFR mutations disrupting drug binding (e.g., C797S),
activation of alternate pathways, aberrant downstream signaling
and lineage plasticity leading to small cell transformation.
4,5
However, over 30% of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib
remain unexplained, which attracts the exploration of new
resistance mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies for
the treatment of TKI-resistant NSCLC.

Metabolic reprogramming is considered one of the main
hallmarks of malignant tumors and has profound impacts on
genome stability, cell proliferation and the tumor microenviron-
ment.
7 As fundamental bricks of cell structure, amino acids
provide building blocks for protein synthesis and serve as sources
of energy and metabolites required by proliferating cells. 8
Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including valine, leucine
and isoleucine, are essential amino acids that not only serve as
nutrient substrates, but can also be degraded to provide multiple
metabolites for other pathways involved in oncogenesis.

cytosolic BCAT1 and mitochondrial BCAT2, initiate BCAA metabo-
lism by reversibly transferring the amino group from BCAAs to
alpha-ketoglutarate ( α-KG) to produce glutamate and their
corresponding branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs). Subsequently,
the BCKAs undergo decarboxylation by the branched-chainα-keto
acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex in the mitochondria and
eventually metabolized into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and
succinyl-CoA to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
11 Altered
BCAA metabolism is associated with tumor progression in many
types of human cancers, including glioblastoma, pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, leukemia, hepatocellular carci-
noma and NSCLC.
12–14 Mayers et al. revealed that Kras-driven
NSCLC incorporated free BCAAs as nitrogen resources for
nucleotide synthesis to support tumor growth.
12 More strikingly,
upregulated BCAT1 and reprogrammed BCAA metabolism in
NSCLC cells have been reported to attenuate reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation and mediate short-term tolerance to
ﬁrst-generation EGFR TKIs.
15 While these studies present the
potential oncogenic roles of BCAA metabolism in NSCLC, how
tumor cells orchestrate oncogenic BCAA metabolism to support
NSCLC progression remains largely elusive. Moreover, no agents
targeting BCAA metabolism have been reported for NSCLC
treatment.
α-KG plays a critical role in multiple biological processes,
including metabolic reprogramming, signaling modules and
genetic regulation.
16 As the substrate of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-
dependent dioxygenases, α-KG stimulates hydroxylases such as
prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and factor inhibiting HIF-1α 1 (FIH-1) to
restrict the activity of HIF-1α signaling. Moreover, α-KG impacts
gene expression and cellular stemness by activating the Jumonji-C
(JmjC) family of lysine demethylases (KDMs) (JmjC-KDMs) and ten-
eleven translocation (TET) enzymes which mediate histone- and
DNA demethylation, respectively.
17 Additionally, glutamate dehy-
drogenase 1 (GLUD1) mediated α-KG production contributes to
triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition in docetaxel- or
geﬁtinib-resistant lung cancer.
18 Nonetheless, the precise mechan-
isms linking α-KG to drug resistance remain unclear.
In this study, we employed high-throughput proteomics
analysis to characterize proteome alterations upon acquired
resistance, aiming to identifying new resistance mechanisms to
third-generation EGFR TKIs. BCAT1 emerged as a highly upregu-
lated protein in TKI-resistant cells compared to TKI-sensitive cells
and plays a key role in supporting cell survival and maintaining
drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, overexpres-
sion of BCAT1 accelerated BCAA anabolism to facilitate α-KG-
dependent epigenetic activation of glycolysis genes in TKI-
resistant cells, consequently enhancing glycolysis to maintain
cellular viability and mediate drug resistance. Moreover, we
developed and characterized WQQ-345 as a novel BCAT1-
targeted inhibitor, and demonstrated its in vitro and in vivo
antitumor efﬁcacy against TKI-resistant NSCLC tumors.
RESULTS
BCAT1 is upregulated in EGFR TKI-resistant tumors and associated
with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma
EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines were generated as previously
described by dose escalation exposure of TKI-sensitive NCI-H1975
(EGFR
L858R/T790M) NSCLC cells to ASK120067 or osimertinib
(denoted by 67R and AZDR, respectively).3 We further validated
the decreased sensitivity of resistant cells to the respective EGFR
TKI compared to parental cells using colony formation and cell
proliferation assays (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). To investigate
deregulated proteins associated with drug resistance, we con-
ducted stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
(SILAC) assay-based proteomic proﬁling comparing 67R and AZDR
single-cell clones alongside their parental NCI-H1975 cells (Fig.1a).
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c, 67R exhibited similar protein
expression patterns from that of AZDR in comparison to NCI-
H1975 cells, indicating shared mechanisms of drug resistance to
third-generation EGFR-TKI agents. To discover potential common
resistance biomarker, we extracted the proteins that were
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in both 67R and AZDR cells,
resulting in 171 up-regulated and 392 down-regulated over-
lapping proteins (Fig. 1b). Pathway enrichment analysis of these
overlapping proteins revealed signiﬁcant dysregulation of meta-
bolic pathways, including BCAA degradation, fatty acid degrada-
tion, glycerolipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, arginine/
proline metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1c).
Remarkably, proteins involved in BCAA degradation was most
signiﬁcantly altered in resistant cells, suggesting potential
involvement of reprogrammed BCAA metabolism in EGFR TKI-
mediated drug resistance.
Among all the enzymes involved in BCAAs degradation (Fig.1d),
we observed that branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1
(BCAT1) was also a top signi ﬁcantly up-regulated overlapping
p r o t e i nm a r k e di nF i g .1b. As the cytosolic enzyme initiating BCAA
metabolism, the increase in BCAT1 expression in the resistant cells
was further conﬁrmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig.
1e, f). Moreover, 67R- and AZDR-resistant xenograft tumors also
showed elevated expression of BCAT1 compared with the parental
tumor tissues (Fig.1g). Additionally, we observed increased BCAT1
expression under short-term high concentration of ASK120067
treatment in NCI-H1975 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Similar trends
were observed in other TKI-sensitive cell models such as PC9
(EGFR
19del) cells and constructed BaF3 cells expressing EGFR Exon
19del/T790M (BaF319del/T790M) (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). These
results showed the upregulated expression of BCAT1 in both TKI-
resistant cells and TKI-tolerant cells. Interestingly, we did not observe
markedly upregulated expression of mitochondrial BCAT2 in our
resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that BCAT1 was
the main BCAT enzyme isoform involved in TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.
To assess the clinical relevance of BCAT1 in lung cancer, we
analyzed specimens from a cohort of patients with primary lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and samples of normal lung tissues using
the GSE31210 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database. Patients with primary LUAD were further categorized
into relapse and non-relapse subgroups based on the observa-
tions during the follow-up period. Remarkably, BCAT1 exhibited
signiﬁcant overexpression in primary LUAD tumors compared with
normal lung tissues. Furthermore, its expression was higher in
tumors from relapsed LUAD patients than in those from the non-
relapsed group (Fig. 2a). Additionally, BCAT1 expression showed
an inverse correlation with relapse-free survival (RFS) time in LUAD
patients (Fig.2b). Moreover, analysis of the supplemental database
(GSE231938) revealed elevated BCAT1 expression in samples from
TKI-resistant NSCLC patients compared to those from TKI-sensitive
NSCLC patients (Fig.2c). These results indicated that BCAT1 may
serve as a potential biomarker associated with poor prognosis and
TKI resistance in lung cancer. In contrast, although the expression
of BCAT2 was upregulated in primary LUAD tumors in comparison
to normal lung tissues, there was no difference in BCAT2
expression between relapsed tumors and non-relapsed group
(Supplementary Fig. 3c), or between TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant
patients (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Additionally, no signi ﬁcant
correlation was observed between BCAT2 expression and tumor
relapse in LUAD patients (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
Besides clinical database analysis, we collected clinical tumor
samples and detected BCAT1 expression using immunohisto-
chemical staining. As illustrated in Fig.2d, BCAT1 expression levels
were markedly elevated in lung cancer tumors compared with
adjacent noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, we observed an even
greater elevation of BCAT1 levels in osimertinib-resistant tumors
compared to lung cancer tumors. Theseﬁndings underscore the
clinical relevance of BCAT1 in lung cancer, particularly in TKI-
resistant cases.

BCAT1 confers EGFR TKI resistance in vitro and in vivo
Given BCAT1’s upregulation in EGFR TKI-resistant cells in vitro and
in vivo, and its clinical implications, we assessed the effects of
BCAT1 on resistant cell growth and survival using a colony
formation assay. Notably, knockdown of BCAT1 by speciﬁc short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) markedly suppressed colony formation in
both 67R and AZDR cells (Fig.3a, b). Treatment with the BCAT1
inhibitor gabapentin selectively decreased resistant cell formation

(Fig. 3c, d) without affecting the growth of parental NCI-H1975
cells (Fig. 3e). Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 by
gabapentin sensitized 67R and AZDR cells to ASK120067 and
osimertinib, respectively (Fig.3f, g). Similar results were observed
using a cell proliferation assay, where gabapentin selectively
suppressed cell proliferation in 67R and AZDR cells compared with
NCI-H1975 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and combination of
gabapentin and ASK120067 or osimertinib exhibited synergistical
anti-growth effects in the corresponding resistant cells (Fig. 3h
and Supplementary Fig. 4b). These results demonstrated that
BCAT1 was required for cell survival and and drug resistance in
TKI-resistant cells. While no signiﬁcant changes were observed in
BCAT1 protein levels upon gabapentin or EGFR TKI treatment
(Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4e), consistent with the
reported target selectivity of EGFR TKIs and gabapentin as an
inhibitor of BCAT1 enzyme activity, we surprisingly found that the
combination of gabapentin and EGFR TKI synergistically decreased
BCAT1 protein levels in TKI-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e),
a phenomenon not previously reported. We speculate that this
could be due to the selection of non-responding lower-BCAT1 67R
populations or to complicated signaling crosstalk, which still
needs further elucidation.
To further determine the functional role of BCAT1 in a mouse
model, we established subcuta neous xenograft models using
67R cells stably expressing either shCtrl or shBCAT1. We found
that knockdown of BCAT1 signiﬁcantly impaired the ability of
67R cells to form tumors, leading to a noticeable decrease in
both tumor formation rate and tumor weight (Fig. 3i, j and

treatment, ASK120067 exhibited enhanced antitumor ef ﬁcacy
against BCAT1-knockdown 67R tumors compared to control 67R

57.46% versus 27.87% at a dose of 1 mg/kg and 69.70% versus
39.46% at a dose 2.5 mg/kg on day 63 (Fig.3k and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4g, h). These ﬁndings con ﬁrmed the critical role of

of drug resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs in vitro and
in vivo.

BCAT1 facilitates α-KG generation to support cell growth of
resistant cells
As BCAT1 was a key enzyme responsible for the reversible
conversion from BCAAs andα-KG into BCKAs and glutamate, we
next sought to explore how elevated BCAT1 reprogrammed BCAA
metabolism in resistant cells using stable isotope tracing. 67R cells
stably expressing shCtrl or shBCAT1 were incubated with [
13C]-
Leu_M + 6 and [13C]-KIC_M + 2 and analyzed for their speciﬁc
resulting metabolites [ 13C]-KIC_M + 6 and [ 13C]-Leu_M + 2,
respectively (Fig. 4a). We found that BCAT1 knockdown signiﬁ-
cantly decreased the cellular ratio of [ 13C]-Leu_M + 2/[13C]-
KIC_M + 2 without markedly affecting the ratio of [13C]-KIC_M +
6/ [13C]-Leu_M + 6. This indicated that highly expressed BCAT1 in
resistant cells might accelerate BCAA anabolism more than BCAA
degradation (Fig. 4b).
We further conﬁrmed the changes in BCAA anabolic metabo-
lites in resistant cells and found that intracellularα-KG accumu-
lated signiﬁcantly in 67R cells compared to parental NCI-H1975
cells, while the total free BCAA pool remained unchanged (Fig.4c).
Additionally, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1
resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in intracellular α-KG levels in
67R cells, whereas no signiﬁcant reduction in BCAA levels was
observed upon BCAT1 knockdown or inhibition (Fig.4d, e). These
results suggested that the upregulated BCAT1 in resistant cells
mainly led to the accumulation of cellularα-KG rather than BCAAs,
and we speculated that the sufﬁcient pool of BCAAs from cell-
culture media might be the reason for BCAA homeostasis upon
changed BCAT1 in tumor cells. We further explored how α-KG
affected cell growth in resistant cells. As shown in Fig. 4f,
exogenous supplementation with a cell-permeable derivative ofα-
KG (dimethyl-α-KG, DM-αKG) promoted cell colony formation and
signiﬁcantly rescued the antitumor effect of gabapentin on 67R
cells. Moreover, cell proliferation assay showed that supplementa-
tion with α-KG not only rescued the growth inhibition caused by
gabapentin (Fig. 4g) but also compromised the synergistic anti-
growth effects of the gabapentin and ASK120067 combination in
67R cells (Fig. 3h and Fig. 4h). Similar results were observed in
AZDR cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b–d). Taken together, our results
demonstrated that the increase in the BCAA anabolic productα-
KG contributed to BCAT1-mediated cell survival in resistant cells.
BCAT1 promotes drug resistance throughα-KG-dependent H3K27
demethylation
α-KG is an important metabolite involved in the metabolic control
of cell fate by serving as a cofactor for several epigenetic-
modifying enzymes, including the Jumonji-C (JmjC) family of
lysine demethylases (KDMs) (JmjC-KDMs) and ten-eleven translo-
cation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenases.
19 To determine
whether the accumulation of α-KG in resistant cells promoted
tumor progression via chromatin modulation, weﬁrst assessed the
histone lysine methylation patterns known to be partly regulated
by α-KG-dependent demethylases.20 As shown in Fig.5a, 67R cells
exhibited a dramatic decrease in H3K27me3 expression compared
to parental NCI-H1975 cells. Moreover, the levels of H3K27me2
and H3K27me1 were also lower in 67R cells, while no signiﬁcant
changes in H3K79me2, H3K36me3, H3K9me1/2/3 and H3K4me1/
2/3 were observed between 67R and NCI-H1975 cells.
As H3K27me3 demethylation was reported to promote the
transition to a drug-tolerant state during chemotherapy treatment
and was most signiﬁcantly affected in 67R-resistant cells,
21 we
next sought to investigate whether BCAT1 mediated α-KG
accumulation led to the downregulated methylation of
H3K27me3. Notably, BCAT1 knockdown markedly increased global
H3K27me3 expression, which was rescued by supplementation
with α-KG (Fig. 5b). This indicates that highly expressed BCAT1 in
67R cells negatively regulated H3K27me3 in anα-KG-dependent
manner. We further treated NCI-H1975 and 67R cells with GSK-J4,
which is a cell-permeable inhibitor that preferentially suppresses
KDM6A and KDM6B, two H3K27me3-speciﬁc JmjC-KDMs requiring
α-KG as a cofactor,
22 and investigate the effect of GSK-J4 on
H3K27me3 expression and cell growth. As expected, GSK-J4 dose-
dependently upregulated H3K27me3 in 67R-resistant cells without
affecting the levels of H3K27me3 in NCI-H1975 cells (Fig. 5c).
Moreover, GSK-J4 treatment rescued the decrease in H3K27me3
level observed uponα-KG supplementation in BCAT1-knockdown
67R cells (Fig.5d), suggesting an important role of KDM6A/6B in
regulating α-KG-dependent H3K27me3 demethylation. Addition-
ally, GSK-J4 exhibited enhanced growth-inhibition activity in 67R
cells compared to NCI-H1975 cells (Fig.5e), and treatment with
GSK-J4 further sensitized 67R cells to ASK120067 inhibition
(Fig. 5f).
Additionally, since α-KG also activates TET-dependent DNA
demethylation to catalyze 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), we also detected the levels of
5mc and 5hmc using a DNA dot blot assay to evaluate TET enzyme
activity.
15,17 As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a, we did not
observe lower 5mC or higher 5hmC levels in 67R cells compared
to NCI-H1975 cells, and BCAT1 knockdown hardly affected the
levels of 5mC and 5hmC in 67R cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Consistently, 67R and NCI-H1975 cells showed similar cell growth
inhibition sensitivities to the TET enzyme inhibitor Bobcat339
(Supplementary Fig. 5c). Taken together, the above results
indicated that the accumulation of α-KG in TKI-resistant cells
mediated by BCAT1 favored the demethylation of the repressive
chromatin mark H3K27me3 rather than TET-dependent DNA
demethylation.
Epigenetic regulation of glycolysis-related genes by BCAT1
contributes to drug resistance
Since H3K27me3 was reported as a general marker regulating
various biological processes,
23 we speculated that α-KG-mediated
demethylation of H3K27me3 resulted in aberrant transcriptional
activation of target genes and subsequent oncogenic signaling to
confer drug resistance. To identify the downstream targets regulated
by α-KG involved in drug resistance, we reanalyzed the enriched
pathways that were signiﬁcantly changed between 67R and NCI-
H1975 cells identiﬁed by the SILAC assay (Fig.1c) in the clinical
GSE31210 dataset. We observed that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
pathway was enriched as the top differential pathway in the BCAT1-
high lung adenocarcinoma samples relative to the BCAT1-low

tumors (Fig.5g). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that
high BCAT1 expression was positively correlated with glycolysis
gene signatures (Fig.5h). To further verify the correlation between
BCAT1 expression and glycolysis in our resistant cells, we conducted
transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and GSEA pathway
analysis, and we found that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
BCAT1 knockdown resulted in a signi ﬁcant decrease in the
expression of genes in the glycolysis pathway (Fig. 5ia n d
Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), suggesting that glycolysis-related genes
are positively regulated by BCAT1 in resistant cells.

Glycolysis is a predominant metabolic pathway for energy
supply and biosynthesis, consisting of more than ten enzymes to
transfer glucose to lactate and produce ATP molecules (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a). Compelling evidence has shown that increasing
glycolysis contributes to EGFR TKI resistance and chemoresistance
in NSCLC.
24–26 To explore whether enhanced glucose metabolism
was involved in resistance to EGFR TKIs, weﬁrst assessed glycolytic
activity in TKI-resistant cells and NCI-H1975 cells using a Seahorse
XF analyzer. We noticed that both 67R and AZDR exhibited an
increased extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR), an indicator of
intrinsic glycolysis, compared with parental NCI-H1975 cells
(Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6c, 7a). Then, RT-qPCR was
performed to detect the transcriptional levels of glycolytic-related
genes highlighted in our RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig.
6b). Consistently, a global upregulation of glycolytic-related genes
were observed in 67R and AZDR cells compared to NCI-H1975
cells (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 7b). Importantly, treatment
with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) signiﬁcantly
sensitized 67R and AZDR cells to corresponding TKI treatment
(Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). These results suggested that
resistant cells exhibited enhanced glycolytic activity to support
cell survival under EGFR TKI treatment. Furthermore, analysis of
the clinical GSE31210 dataset showed that the transcriptional
levels of glycolytic-related ezymes, including PFKP, ENO2, PKM
and LDHA, were markedly upregulated in primary LUAD tumors
relative to normal lung tissues (Fig.6d). Moreover, these enzymes
showed even higher expression levels in tumors from eventually
relapsed LUAD patients compared to those from non-relapsed
patients (Fig. 6e), which supported the clinical association of
enhanced glycolysis with tumor progression in human lung
adenocarcinomas.
We next knocked down BCAT1 in 67R cells using siRNA to
validate the impact of BCAT1 on glycolysis. Notably, BCAT1
knockdown impaired glycolytic activity (Fig.6f) and decreased the
transcriptional levels of key glycolytic enzymes, including PFKP,
ENO2, PKM and LDHA (Fig.6g). Similar results were observed in
67R cells upon gabapentin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e).
To determine if BCAT1-induced glucose metabolism reprogram-
ming was dependent onα-KG-mediated epigenetic regulation, we
conducted an additional rescue assay with α-KG. As shown in
Fig. 6h and Supplementary Fig. 6f, supplementation with α-KG
signiﬁcantly rescued the downregulated mRNA expression of
glycolysis genes upon BCAT1 knockdown or inhibition. Further-
more, ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that BCAT1 knockdown
resulted in substantially higher H3K27me3 enrichment on the
promoters of PFKP and LDHA (Fig.6i) in 67R cells, as well as in
AZDR cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Taken together, these results
demonstrated that BCAT1 facilitated BCAA anabolism andα-KG-
dependent demethylation of H3K27me3, thereby transcriptionally
activating glycolysis genes and contributing to cell survival and
drug resistance (Fig. 6j). Strategies targeting these mechanisms,
such as pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1, KDM6A/B, and
glycolysis, could be effective in reversing EGFR-TKI resistance in
NSCLC.
WQQ-345 is identiﬁed as a novel BCAT1 inhibitor with preclinical
antitumor efﬁcacy
The aboveﬁndings indicated the potential of targeting BCAT1 as a
strategy to overcome EGFR TKI resistance. However, the limited
availability of effective BCAT1 inhibitors, with none of which
demonstrated signiﬁcant in vivo antitumor efﬁcacy, highlights the
need for further investigation and development of novel BCAT1
inhibitors. Inspired by reports of BCAT1 inhibition by the γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivative gabapentin,
27 we screened
an in-house compound library of GABA derivatives with unique
structures, which led to the discovery of WQQ-345 as a BCAT1
inhibitor (Fig.7a). The synthetic route to WQQ-345 is illustrated in
Scheme 1, and detailed synthetic procedures and characterization
of the compound against BCAT1 were provided in the supple-
mentary materials and methods. A BCAT1 enzyme activity assay
was conducted, and as shown in Fig. 7b, WQQ-345 dose-
dependently suppressed the activity of puri ﬁed recombinant
BCAT1 protein, with an IC 50 of 10.8 mM. To understand the
molecular interactions between BCAT1 and WQQ-345, we
performed a molecular docking analysis. As detailed in Fig.7c,
WQQ-345 formed direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds via
carboxylate moiety and amino moiety with residues in the BCAT1
active site, including Ala334, Tyr161 and Thr260. At the same time,
the norbornane of WQQ-345 formed van der Waals interactions
with surrounding residues, such as Phe49, Phe95, Tyr161, Tyr193,
and Tyr227. The docking results predicted the binding mode and
helped explain the inhibitory potency of WQQ-345 on BCAT1.
Next, we explored the cellular effects of WQQ-345 in our TKI-
resistant lung cancer models. A cellular thermal shift assay was
conducted to evaluate the thermal stabilization of BCAT1 upon
drug binding in 67R cells. Similar to gabapentin, pre-incubation
with WQQ-345 improved the thermal stability of cellular BCAT1 at
the indicated denaturation temperatures compared to the control,
which supported the cellular binding of WQQ-345 to the BCAT1
protein (Supplementary Fig. 8a).
Meanwhile, WQQ-345 dose-dependently reduced the colony
formation of 67R resistant cells (Fig.7d), and its on-target anti-
growth effects were further conﬁrmed through a cell prolifera-
tion assay, where knockdown of BCAT1 signi ﬁcantly compro-
mised the growth inhibition caused by WQQ-345 in 67R and
AZDR cells (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c). Furthermore, co-
treatment with WQQ-345 and either ASK120067 or osimertinib
exhibited stronger cell growth inhibition than monotherapy
(Fig. 7e and Supplementary Fig. 8d), indicating that WQQ-345
could partially restore the sensitivity of resistant cells to the

corresponding TKIs. Mechanisti cally, WQQ-345 treatment led to
decreased cellular α-KG levels, upregulated H3K27me3 expres-
sion, and resulted in lower expression of glycolytic enzymes
(PFKP and LDHA), and impaired glycolysis activity in 67R cells
(Fig. 7f–i).
Further animal experiments were conducted to validate the
in vivo potency of WQQ-345 in TKI-resistant tumors. As shown in
Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 8e, oral administration of WQQ-345
at 120 mg/kg led to robust tumor regression in the 67R
subcutaneous xenograft model. Moreover, WQQ-345-treated

tumors exhibited increased H3K27me3 expression and decreased
levels of PFKP, LDHA, and PKM1/2 compared to the vehicle control
tumors (Fig. 7k). Collectively, these results, along with our in vitro
observations, conﬁrmed the antitumor and anti-glycolytic effects
of WQQ-345, which supported the idea of pharmacological
inhibition of BCAT1 as a potential therapy for TKI-resistant NSCLC.
DISCUSSION
Although EGFR TKIs have revolutionized theﬁeld of EGFR-mutant
NSCLC therapy, acquired resistance inevitably occurs due to tumor
heterogeneity and adaptability. The mechanisms of acquired
resistance are complex and can involve EGFR alterations (muta-
tion/ampliﬁcation), activations of bypass or downstream path-
ways, and changes in the phenotype.
5,6 However, the contribution
of metabolic reprogramming in EGFR-TKI resistance is poorly
understood. Here, based on our previously established resistant
NSCLC models, we identiﬁed BCAT1 as a crucial biomarker and
mediator of drug resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs,
including osimertinib and ASK120067. Knockdown or pharmaco-
logical inhibition of BCAT1 selectively inhibited the in vitro and
in vivo growth of resistant tumors and partially restored their
sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. Mechanistically, elevated production ofα-
KG by BCAT1 promoted the expression of glycolysis genes by
facilitating KDM6A/6B-mediated H3K27 demethylation, thus lead-
ing to enhanced glycolysis, cell survival, and drug tolerance.
Consistent with these preclinicalﬁndings, BCAT1 and several key
downstream glycolysis genes are upregulated in primary lung
cancer, with even higher expression in samples from patients who
eventually relapsed. Furthermore, BCAT1 expression is signiﬁcantly
higher in samples from TKI-resistant NSCLC patients compared to
those from TKI-sensitive patients and is associated with poor
prognosis in NSCLC. Ourﬁndings highlight the important role of
BCAT1 in mediating metabolic reprogramming and drug resis-
tance, indicating its promising potential as a biomarker and
therapeutic target in NSCLC.
BCAT1 is a cytosolic enzyme that initiates the catabolism of
BCAAs. Enhanced expression of BCAT1 disrupts BCAA metabolism
and contributes to liver disease, in ﬂammatory disease, insulin
resistance, Alzheimer ’s disease, and tumor progression.
14,28,29
BCAT1 catalyzes the reversible transamination of BCAAs to BCKAs,
accompanied by the amination ofα-KG to glutamate, and these
metabolites are involved in multiple cellular processes. Therefore,
how BCAT1 reprograms BCAA metabolism to support tumor
progression is complex and could be cell context- and stress
context-dependent. In IDH1
wt gliomas, BCAT1 is activated to
facilitate glutamate production for promoting cell proliferation,
and catabolism of BCAAs is required to sustain tumor progres-
sion.
30 In NSCLC, BCAT1 transcription is associated with poor
overall survival of patients, and overexpression of BCAT1 causesα-
KG restriction and further increases SRY (sex determining region Y)
-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) expression to promote cell
stemness and metastasis.
31 Moreover, upregulated BCAT1 in lung
cancer cells has been shown to enhance GSH production,
contributing to short-term acquired resistance to the ﬁrst-
generation EGFR TKI ge ﬁtinib.15 Recently, a gain-of-function
BCAT1 glutamic acid to alanine mutation at codon 61 (BCAT1E61A)
in gastric cancer was identiﬁed in clinical cases. It confers higher
enzymatic activity to boost BCAA catabolism and accelerate cell
growth and motility and contributes to tumor development by
BCKA-dependent elevation of RhoC activity.
32 The above studies
support the oncogenic roles of BCAT1 by facilitating BCAA
breakdown and increasing downstream catabolic metabolites.
Additionally, opposing metabolicﬂuxes promoted by BCAT1 have
also been reported. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), BCAT1 is
aberrantly activated and required for tumor propagation by
promoting BCAA production.
13 Also, BCAT1 is reported to
cooperate with NRAS G12D to sustain intracellular BCAA pools
and promote leukemic transformation through activated mTOR
signaling.
33 In our study, we demonstrated that BCAT1 facilitated
BCAA anabolic metabolism, thereby enhancing α-KG-dependent
glycolysis to orchestrate resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs
in NSCLC. This ﬁnding provided a new context-dependent
mechanism of BCAA metabolism reprogramming-mediated tumor
progression and further elucidated the role of BCAT1 in conferring
EGFR-TKI resistance. However, the drivers of BCAT1 upregulation
during acquired drug resistance were not discussed in this study
and deserves further investigation.
α-KG is an essential metabolite involved in various metabolic
and epigenetic regulatory processes and shows multifaceted
contributions to tumor progression. Considering only its role in
chromatin modiﬁcations, α-KG can cause distinct cellular effects
through its predominant downstream genes under different
circumstances. For example, the accumulation of α-KG induced
by restoring p53 function upregulates chromatin modiﬁcation of
5-hmC to promote tumor suppressor gene expression in cancer
cells derived fromKras mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC).
34 In contrast, elevatedα-KG is reported to be required to
maintain an epigenetic state of low H3K27me3 by serving as a
cofactor for the H3K27 demethylases KDM6A/6B in diffuse midline
gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27
(H3K27M).
35 In our TKI-resistant NSCLC models, we reveal thatα-
KG is a key metabolite upregulated by BCAT1, epigenetically
activating glycolysis and sustaining cell survival and drug
resistance. Although an activated glycolytic phenotype and non-
mutational epigenetic reprogramming are emerging as important
cancer hallmarks, their roles in third-generation EGFR-TKI resis-
tance are not yet fully established.
36,37 Our ﬁndings present the
function of α-KG in linking BCAA metabolism to epigenetic
regulation and glycolysis in TKI-resistant NSCLC, which provides an
extensive understanding of the intricate crosstalk between
multiple metabolic pathways and epigenetics in cancer
development.
Increasing evidence implicates BCAT1 as a promising drug
target for cancer therapy, yet the discovery of effective BCAT1
inhibitors remains limited. Among these inhibitors, gabapentin is
the most commonly used BCAT1 inhibitor, which has demon-
strated in vitro or in vivo antitumor efﬁcacies in glioblastoma,

cells. These research ﬁndings underscored the therapeutic
implications of targeting BCAT1 not only for inﬂammatory disease
and also for multiple tumors. However, none of these inhibitors
has shown strong antitumor potency in NSCLC. In this study, we
identiﬁed WQQ-345 as a novel BCAT1 inhibitor that selectively
suppressed the in vitro growth of BCAT1-highly expressing third-
generation EGFR TKI-resistant cells and exerted promising
antitumor ef ﬁcacy in resistant xenograft model. Additionally,
ongoing efforts are focused on developing more selective BCAT1
inhibitors with enhanced ef ﬁcacy and evaluating their perfor-
mance in established tumor models.
In summary, this study elucidates the signiﬁcance of BCAT1-
mediated BCAA metabolic reprogramming in enhancing cell survival
and TKI resistance in NSCLC, which provided extensive evidence for
directly targeting BCAT1 as a therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

Committee of Shanghai Chest Hospital (Approval number:
IS23049), and Shanghai pulmonary hospital, Tongji University
(Approval number: K23-171), respectively. Immunohistochemistry
of parafﬁn sections was carried out by Shanghai ZuoChengBio
using a two-step protocol according to the manufacturer ’s
instructions. Brieﬂy, parafﬁn sections were ﬁrst deparafﬁnized
with xylene and then hydrated with ethanol. Antigen retrieval was
performed by immersing the specimens in 0.01 mol/L citrate
buffer at pH 6.0 and exposing it to microwave heating for 10 min
at 450 W. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4–8 °C with
primary antibody against BCAT1 (Proteintech, #13640-1-AP). After
washing off the primary antibody, the sections were treated with
the Envision detection system kit (EnVision1/HRP/Mo, Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). Reaction products were visualized by
incubating with DAB. Finally, the sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to visualize the nuclei.
Lentiviral— shRNA gene knockdown
BCAT1 targeted shRNA vectors (pLKD-CMV-G&PR-U6-shRNA) were
purchased from Obio technology (Shanghai, China). Targeted
sequences were as follows: shCtrl: 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′;
shBCAT1-1: 5′-GGGAGAAACCTCATATCAA-3′; shBCAT1-2: 5′-GGA-
GAAGAAGAACTGGCAA-3′. shBCAT1 was the same as shBCAT-1.
Lentivirus was produced by transfecting 293 T cells with
Lipofectamine 2000 using shRNA vectors and lentiviral packaging
plasmids (pCMV-Gag-Pol and pCMV-VSV-G). 293T culture super-
natants containing viral particles were collected at 48 h after
transfection and ﬁltrated through a 0.45μm ﬁltration membrane.
Cells were infected with shRNA-lentivirus with 8μg/mL polybrene
for 24 h, and positive clones were obtained by puromycin
selection.
Colony formation assays
Cells were seeded into a 6-well or 12-well plate at a density of
800–1000 cells per well and cultured overnight. After being
exposed to indicated agents for 7 to 10 days, cells wereﬁxed with
ﬁxation ﬂuid (10% acetic acid+ 10% methanol+ 80% ddH
2O) and
stained with crystal violet. The colonies wereﬁnally imaged and
counted.
Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB)
colorimetric assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and
cultured overnight. Then cells were treated with indicated
concentration of test compounds for 72 –108 h. Subsequently,
the SRB assay was conducted according to standard protocols
Speciﬁcally, 100 μL of 10% pre-cooled trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
was added to each well after removing the culture medium. The
plate was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C toﬁx the cells. After
incubation, the TCA solution was removed, and the wells were
washed ﬁve times with distilled water. After the plates dried,
100 μL of 4 mg/mL SRB solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
prepared with 1% acetic acid was added to each well and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then the SRB solution
was removed, and each well was washedﬁve times with a 1%
acetic acid solution before drying. To solubilize the stain, 150 µL of
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl was added to each well, and the plate was
shaken occasionally at room temperature. The absorbance at
560 nm of each well was then measured using a multi-well
VersaMax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). The proliferation inhibition rates were calculated as follows:
Inhibition rate (%) = [1 − (A560
treated/A560 control)] × 100%. The
IC50 values were calculated using the Logit method based on
dose–response curve. Additionally, the effects of drug combina-
tion were visualized, and synergy scores were analyzed by
SynergyFinder using Bliss model. The interaction between two
drugs is considered as synergistic, additive or antagonistic when
synergy score is more than 10, from−10 to 10, or less than−10,
respectively.
In vivo xenograft model and drug administration
67R cells (1 × 10
7 cells per mouse), 67R-shCtrl cells (5 × 106 cells
per mouse), or 67R-shBCAT1 cells (1 × 107 cells per mouse) were
subcutaneously implanted into the right ﬂanks of 4-week-old
BALB/c nude mice. Tumors with stable morphology were then cut
into fragments and transplanted into the right ﬂanks of nude
mice. When tumors reached nearly 50 –70 mm
3, mice were
randomly divided into control and treatment groups. Tumor
volume (TV) was measured and calculated using the formula
TV = (L × W
2)/2. L and W represented the longest and shortest
diameter (mm) of the tumor, respectively. The tumor growth
inhibition rate (TGI) was calculated as TGI (%) = [1 – (TVt – TV0)/
(CVt − CV0)] × 100. Tvt and CVt were the average tumor volumes on
the day of investigation in the treatment group and control
group, respectively. T
V0 and CV0 represented the tumor volume of
the treatment group and control group at the beginning of the
study, respectively. All procedures on mice were performed
according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (Approval number: 2022-02-DJ-66)
following the guidance of the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care at Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica.
13C-Stable isotope labeling
Cells were seeded in 10 cm plates and cultured overnight in RPMI
1640 complete medium. After being washed three times with PBS,
the cells were incubated with custom RPMI 1640 medium lacking
BCAAs with supplementation of [
13C]- leucine_M + 6 (50 mg/L),
isoleucine (50 mg/L), valine (20 mg/L), [13C] KIC M+ 2 (20μM) and
10% FBS for 2 h. After that, cells were digested using trypsin-EDTA
and washed 3 times with PBS. Cell pellet samples (10 7 cells/
sample) were collected and stored at−80 °C. Gibco® custom RPMI
1640 medium lacking BCAAs were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc. [ 13C]-Leucine_M + 6 (#CLM-2262-H-0.1) and [ 13C]-
KIC_M + 2 (#CLM-4826-0.1) were purchased from Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories. Isoleucine (#I7403) and valine (#V0513) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA).
Labeled metabolites were quantitated by Metabo-Pro ﬁle
Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Brieﬂy, cell samples were added
with 400 μL of 80% methanol solution and sonicated (JY92-IIN,
NingBo Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). After centrifugation and
concentration, the supernatant was added with 100μL of 80%
methanol solution. Metabolite analysis was conducted using an

turer. Samples were sent to Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) to perform RNA
puriﬁcation, reverse transcription, library construction and sequen-
cing. The transcriptome library for RNA-seq was generated by
using 1μg of total RNA with the Illumina® Stranded mRNA Prep,
Ligation kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). After quality control of
raw reads, the clean reads were mapped using HISAT2 software
and further assembled by StringTiein. Cellular pathway analysis
was conducted using GSEA.
Extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) measuring
Seahorse XF Glycolytic Rate Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies,
#103344-100) was used to measure real-time extracellular
acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells were initially seeded in the Agilent Seahorse XFp Cell Culture
Miniplate and cultured overnight. Subsequently, the cells were
washed and cultured in Seahorse XF RPMI medium (Agilent
Technologies, #103576-100) at pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mM
pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were
then incubated at 37 °C in a non-CO
2 incubator for 45–60 min and
followed by exposure to 0.5μM Rotenone and Antimycin A (Rot/
AA), 50 mM 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) sequentially. Finally, the
assay template was loaded onto the Seahorse XFp Analyzer, and
real-time ECAR was recorded.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP assays were performed using SimpleChIP® Plus Enzymatic
Chromatin IP Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, #9005S) according to
the manufacturer ’s instructions. Samples were sonicated and
immunoprecipitated using either IgG or anti-H3K27me3 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, #9733 S). The levels of immunopreci-
pitated DNA fragments were evaluated by qPCR. Primers used are
listed in Supporting Information: Table S2.
DNA dot blot
Total DNA samples were extracted using the AFTSpin Blood/
Tissue/Cell Fast DNA Extractio n Kit (Abclonal, #RK30110) and
denatured at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were rapidly placed on
ice for 10 min and then loaded to positively charged nylon
membranes. After being crossed with UV, the membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and incubated
with 5 mC (Abclonal, #A20599) and 5hmC antibodies (Cell
Signaling Technology, #51660 S). Besides, the membranes
were stained with 0.2% methylene blue to verify equal
DNA input.
