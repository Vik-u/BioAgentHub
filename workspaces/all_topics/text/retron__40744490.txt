Abstract 
Retrons are a retroelement class found in div erse prokary otes that can be adapted to augment CRISPR–Cas9 genome engineering technology to 
efficiently rewrite short stretches of genetic information in bacteria and yeast. However, efficiency in human cells has been limited by unknown 
factors. We identified non-coding RNA (ncRNA) inst abilit y and impaired Cas9 activity due to 5 ′ sgRNA extension as key contributors to low 
retron editor efficiency in human cells. We re-engineered the Eco1 ncRNA to incorporate an e x oribonuclease-resistant RNA pseudoknot from 
the Zika virus 3 ′ UTR and devised an RNA processing strategy using Csy4 ribonuclease to minimize 5 ′ sgRNA extension. This strategy increased 
steady -state ncRNA le v els and rescued sgRNA activity, leading to increased templated repair. This work reveals a previously unappreciated role 
for ncRNA st abilit y in retron editor efficiency in human cells and presents an enhanced Eco1 retron editor capable of precise genome editing in 
human cells from a single integrated lentivirus and, in the context of the nCas9 H840A nickase, without creating double-strand breaks.

Introduction 
Germline and somatic genetic variants play an important role 
in human health and disease [ 1–4 ]. CRISPR–Cas9 technol- 
ogy has revolutionized the manipulation of genetic informa- 
tion by enabling RNA-programmable delivery of enzymatic 
activities to targeted locations in the genome, facilitating new 
genome editing technologies that can interrogate the rela- 
tionship between genotype and phenotype in living systems 
[ 5 ]. When delivered via lentivirus at a low multiplicity of in- 
fection (MOI) to ensure a single integration per cell, linked

genotype–phenotype relationships can be maintained over 
multiple cell divisions and the fate of individually edited cells 
and their progeny can be tracked. This significantly simpli- 
fies the scalable parallelization of forward genetic screens, re- 
trieval of rare clones from a population of cells, and somatic 
editing in genetically engineered models of cancer. 
Base editors can install single nucleotide variants with high 
efficiency but require distinct and exquisitely engineered edit- 
ing enzymes to generate different types of mutations, limiting 
their generalizability as genome editing tools [ 6 ]. In contrast, 
prime editors offer a greater potential to efficiently introduce a 
wide spectrum of mutation types, including small insertions; 
however, each prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) requires 
extensive design effort to yield efficient editing, complicating 
the construction of large pegRNA libraries [ 7–10 ]. There re- 
mains a need for additional methods to complement current 
genome editing tools that have the properties of broad editing 
potential, predictable activity, and compatibility with lentivi- 
ral delivery. 
Retrons are prokaryotic retroelements that play a role 
in anti-phage defense systems [ 11–19 ]. Retrons have been 
adapted as genome editing tools by harnessing their abil- 
ity to generate homology-directed repair templates in situ 
[ 20–26 ]. A retron minimally consists of a non-coding RNA 
(ncRNA) that is reverse transcribed into multicopy single- 
stranded DNA (msDNA) by its cognate primer-independent 
reverse transcriptase (RT) [ 27 , 28 ]. The retron ncRNA con- 
tains both the msr stem loops that are required for recogni- 
tion and initiation of reverse transcription and the msd seg- 
ment that contains the reverse transcription template [ 27 ]. 
Arbitrary sequences of interest can be inserted into the msd 
stem–loop, where they are reversed transcribed into RT-DNA 
[ 27 ]. Fusion of retron protein and RNA components to their 
respective CRISPR–Cas9 counterparts results in targeted, tem- 
plated DNA repair [ 22 ]. However, the application of retrons 
as genome editing tools in human cells has been limited due to 
low efficiency of templated repair and editing outcomes domi- 
nated by indels introduced through non-homologous end join- 
ing (NHEJ) [ 23–25 ]. 
Previous efforts to improve retron editor efficiency have fo- 
cused on the cellular abundance of RT-DNA [ 25 , 29 ]. Here, 
we determined that retron ncRNA and single guide RNA 
(sgRNA) fusion transcripts are unstable in human cells. These 
unstable ncRNAs exhibit limited templated editing efficiency 
and Cas9 endonuclease activity, ultimately resulting in dimin- 
ished editing. Through iterative optimization and rational de- 
sign, we developed a ncRNA architecture derived from the 
Eco1 (Ec86) retron with enhanced genome editing efficiency 
without causing double-strand breaks, reducing unproduc- 
tive editing outcomes and broadening the utility of retrons as 
genome editing tools in human cells. 
Materials and methods 
Cell culture 
Parental HEK293T cell lines and their derivatives were 
cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) with l -glutamine and sodium pyru- 
vate (Gibco) and supplemented with 10% Foundation™
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products). K562 cell 
lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 
l -glutamine (Gibco) and 10% Foundation™ FBS (Gemini 
Bio-Products). Both HEK293T and K562 parental lines were 
obtained from ATCC. All cell lines were grown at 37 ◦C and 
5% CO 2 . Huh-7.5 cells were maintained in DMEM (Fisher 
Scientific, catalog no. 11995065) supplemented with 0.1 
mM nonessential amino acids (Fisher Scientific, catalog 
no. 11140076) and 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, 
lot #AUJ35777). 
Plasmid cloning 
All oligos and gBlocks used in this study are listed in 
Supplementary Table S1 . Plasmids were transformed and 
propagated in NEB Stable Competent E. coli (New England 
Biolabs). All ncRNA-expressing plasmids were cloned from 
lentiGuide-Puro (lentiGuide-Puro was a gift from Feng Zhang, 
Addgene #52963) using the PacI restriction enzyme cloning 
sites followed by NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (New Eng- 
land Biolabs) of synthesized gBlock™ gene fragments (Inte- 
grated DNA T echnologies). Cas9-RT wt expression plasmid 
was cloned from pBZ210 (pBZ210 was a gift from Hunter 
Fraser, Addgene #170185) by XbaI and PciI double diges- 
tion (New England Biolabs) to excise the chimeric sgRNA- 
retron ncRNA, followed by blunting with DNA Polymerase I 
Large Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs). The result- 
ing double-stranded DNA blunt ends were then ligated using a 
T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Cas9-RTmut was generated 
by site-directed mutagenesis. TR-Csy4 and TR-Csy4-H29A 
were gifts from Aravind Asokan (Addgene #80601, Addgene 
#80602). 
In vitro transcription 
T7 expression plasmids were linearized by digestion with 
EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and then purified by phenol–
chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. A 
5- μl in vitro transcription reaction was set up with 250 ng of 
linearized plasmid template, 0.375 μl of T7 RNA Polymerase 
(New England Biolabs), and 100 mM each of ATP , GTP , CTP , 
and UTP, and then incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. In vitro tran- 
scribed (IVT) RNA was then purified by phenol–chloroform 
extraction and ethanol precipitation. 
Plasmid transfection and electroporation 
Lipofectamine 3000 was used for all transient transfections 
of HEK293T-BFP cells. Briefly, 2e5 HEK293T-BFP cells were 
reverse transfected with 750 ng of either Cas9-RTwt or Cas9- 
RTmut and 650 ng of plasmids expressing the retron edi- 
tor ncRNA. For all experiments incorporating Csy4 cleavage, 
750 ng of either Csy4 wild type or Csy4-H29A was added to 
the transfection mix, and constructs without a Csy4 recogni- 
tion site were co-transfected with 750 ng pUC19 (New Eng- 
land Biolabs) to balance total transfected mass. Cells were 
replated in a 12-well plate ∼16–24 h after transfection. The 
Neon NxT Electroporation System was used to electroporate 
K562-BFP ncRNA-expressing cell lines with Cas9-RT plas- 
mids and one of Csy4, Csy4-H29A, or pUC19 to balance to- 
tal transfected mass. 5e5 cells were pelleted at 300 RCF for 5 
min and resuspended in Neon NxT R buffer and then mixed 
with 2500 ng of the Cas9-RT plasmid and 2500 ng of TR- 
Csy4 / TR-Csy4-H29A / pUC19 plasmid. Cells were then elec- 
troporated using the following parameters in a 10- μl Neon 
NxT tip: 1050 V, 20 ms pulse width, 2 pulses. Cells were added 
to 500 μl of pre-warmed RPMI media in a 48-well plate after 
pulsing. 
Enhanced Eco1 retron editor 3 
Flow cytometry 
All flow cytometry experiments were done on a BD FAC- 
Symphony™ A5 Cell Analyzer. To prepare samples, cells 
were centrifuged at 350 RCF for 5 min and the cell pellets 
were resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline 
(Gibco) supplemented with 1% Foundation™ FBS (Gemini 
Bio-Products). Cell populations were analyzed to determine 
the proportion of BFP (blue fluorescent protein) and GFP 
(green fluorescent protein) positive cells and each condition 
was run with three biological replicates. Transfected cells were 
selected using the mCherry fluorescent reporter on the Cas9- 
RT expression plasmids. All gates were drawn using untrans- 
fected control samples. 
Virus production 
T25 flasks were seeded with 2e6 HEK293T cells 24 h prior 
to transfection. On the following day, a transfection solution 
was made up of 200 μl OptiMEM (Gibco), 3 μg of the lentivi- 
ral vector, 2 μg of psPAX2, 1 μg of pMD2.G, and 12 μg 
of PEI 25K (Polysciences). psPAX2 and pMD2.G were gifts 
from Didier Trono (Addgene #12260, Addgene #12259). Af- 
ter mixing, the transfection solution was vortexed for 15 s, 
incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and added to cells 
drop wise. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection. 
At 72 h post-transfection, the viral supernatant was filtered 
through a 0.45- μm syringe filter and immediately stored at 
−80 ◦C. 
Lentivirus transduction 
The HEK293T-BFP cell line was made by limiting dilution 
lentivirus transduction of BFP dest clone lentivirus and se- 
lected with 6 μg / ml blasticidin (Gibco) for 1 week. BFP dest 
clone was a gift from Jacob Corn (Addgene #71825). Cells 
were then single-cell sorted into a 96-well plate for the top 
2.5% fluorescent cells. Single-cell clones were expanded and 
two clonal lines were randomly selected. Low-copy integrated 
ncRNA HEK293T-BFP cell lines were generated by limiting 
dilution lentivirus transduction. 5e5 cells were plated in a 
six-well plate and limiting volumes of viral supernatant were 
added to each well, ranging from 50 to 1 μl. Twenty-four 
hours after the addition of virus, the cells were selected us- 
ing 2 μg / ml puromycin (Gibco) and grown out on puromycin 
for 1 week. For every HEK293T-BFP cell line generated, 1 μl 
of virus was sufficient to yield sparse colonies for subsequent 
outgrowth. 
The K562-BFP cell line used in this study was a gift from 
Dr Chris Richardson. Low-copy integrated ncRNA K562- 
BFP cell lines were generated by limiting dilution spinfection. 
Briefly, 1e6 K562-BFP cells were plated in a six-well plate with 
2 ml of RPMI 1640 media. After plating, 20 μl of lentivirus 
and 2 μl of polybrene (Sigma–Aldrich) were added directly to 
each well and cells were centrifuged at 930 RCF for 2 h at 
room temperature. After centrifugation, 2 ml of RPMI 1640 
media was added to each well and cells were placed back in 
the incubator. Selection for infected cells started 24 h after 
spinfection using 2 μg / ml puromycin. 
Nor thern blot ting 
1e6 HEK293T cells were first reverse transfected in a six- 
well plate with 1 μg of Cas9-RT (either Cas9-RTwt or Cas9- 
RTmut) and 1 μg of ncRNA-expressing plasmid using Lipo- 
fectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Cells were incubated for 48 h and then total RNA was ex- 
tracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by two 
chloroform washes. The aqueous layer was loaded onto a 
Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (New England Biolabs) 
column and purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
To radiolabel single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes, 0.15 mCi 
ATP (- 32 P) (Perkin Elmer) was mixed with 200 ng of the probe 
and T4 Kinase (New England Biolabs) and then incubated at 
37 ◦C for 60 min. Labeled probes were then centrifuged for 
30 s at 16 000 RCF in a MicroSpin G-50 column (Cytiva) 
and eluted in 80 μl of TNES buffer [50 mM Tris, 400 mM 
NaCl, 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5% 
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)]. Probe sequences are listed in 
Supplementary Table S1 . For electrophoretic size separation, 
25 ng of IVT RNA and 7.5 μg of total RNA were loaded per 
well onto a Novex 10% TBE–urea 10-well gel (Invitrogen). 
RNA was then transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge (Cytiva) 
nylon membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo (Bio-Rad) 
at 200 mA for 60 min. Membranes were blocked at 65 ◦C for 1 
h in 30 ml of 6 × SSC 7% SDS blocking buffer. After blocking, 
membranes were incubated overnight at 42 ◦C with 30 μl of 
the radiolabeled probe. Membranes were washed and exposed 
for 48 h before imaging. For U6 loading controls, membranes 
were stripped using 0.1% SDS 2 mM EDTA stripping buffer, 
followed by three washes and then reprobed using a U6 load- 
ing control probe. Loading control membranes were exposed 
for 24 h before imaging. 
Quantitative real-time PCR 
First, 5e5 HEK293T-BFP ncRNA-expressing cells were re- 
verse transfected with 1 μg of Cas9-RTmut plasmid. 
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 
5 μg / ml of dactinomycin (Sigma–Aldrich) and then lysed with 
TRIzol at the specified time points. The TRIzol lysates were 
washed with chloroform and the aqueous phases were loaded 
onto RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen), and washed and 
eluted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To remove 
residual DNA, the purified RNA samples were treated with 
DNase I (New England Biolabs), followed by heat inactiva- 
tion of DNase I at 70 ◦C. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was 
made from the purified RNA using the GoScript Reverse Tran- 
scription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol with 5 μl of input RNA for each reaction. Quan- 
titative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed with PowerUp 
SYBR Green Master Mix and recorded on QuantStudio3. The 
primers used for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . 
Statistics and reproducibility 
All experiments were performed in triplicate. Outcomes here 
are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For all edit- 
ing outcome assays, statistical significance was determined by 
two-sided, unpaired t -tests using the Holm–Šídák method for 
multiple testing correction. Throughout the manuscript, P - 
values are reported as follows: * P < .05, ** P < .01, *** P < 
.001, and **** P < .0001.

retron. A protein-coding plasmid expresses Cas9 fused to a 
codon optimized Eco1 reverse transcriptase by a 33-amino 
acid linker and is followed by a T2A ribosome skipping se- 
quence and mCherry (Cas9-RT mCherry). This construct al- 
lows tracking of transfected cells by red–orange fluorescence 
(Fig. 1 A). To control for background levels of plasmid tem- 
plated repair, we constructed a catalytically dead Eco1 mutant 
(DD196NN, RTmut) [ 30 ] and confirmed that the mutant is 
inactive by qPCR of retron RT-DNA after RNA transfection 
( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). ncRNA plasmids were designed to 
express the Eco1 ncRNA with a 100-nucleotide repair tem- 
plate internal to the msd sequences as previously described 
(msr-msd) [ 22 , 31 ]. Retron ncRNAs or sgRNAs encoded by 
separate plasmids were expressed from the U6 RNAPIII pro- 
moter and terminated by a poly(T) transcription termination 
signal [ 32 ]. 
To compare retron editor designs, we measured genome 
editing rates using an established assay based on the conver- 
sion of an integrated cDNA encoding BFP to GFP by missense 
mutation of the chromophore [ 31 , 33 ]. Cas9-RT mCherry 
and a plasmid encoding an sgRNA targeting the BFP chro- 
mophore (sgBFP) were co-transfected with a repair template 
encoding the mutation conferring GFP expression and a dis- 
ruption of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of sgBFP 
(Fig. 1 B). One of three repair template configurations was 
used: msr-msd plasmid, ( in vitro transcribed) IVT msr-msd 
RNA ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), or a synthetic 100-nucleotide 
ssDNA. Editing outcomes were tracked by the relative propor- 
tion of BFP+ (no edit), BFP − (NHEJ), or GFP+ (HDR) cells 
(Fig. 1 C). 
To investigate the contribution of repair template availabil- 
ity, msr-msd RNA and ssDNA were transfected at either 6 
pmol, representing a typical quantity of transfected ssDNA 
repair template [ 34 ] or 0.6 pmol, a quantity that we predicted 
would be limiting. After 72 h, we quantified editing outcomes 
(Fig. 1 D). While the msr-msd plasmid edited the BFP locus 
to 0.95% ± 0.01%, consistent with prior literature [ 23–25 ], 
transfected IVT msr-msd RNA did not generate any success- 
ful editing events. In contrast, the ssDNA conditions resulted 
in efficient and dose-dependent templated repair of 5.47% 
± 0.23% and 10.73% ± 0.15% in the 0.6 and 6 pmol con- 
ditions, respectively. These results highlight a positive corre- 
lation between ssDNA quantity and editing efficiency and are 
consistent with the hypothesis that the Eco1 retron produces 
insufficient suitable homology template in comparison to 
ssDNA. 
Steady-state levels of retron ncRNAs are limited in 
human cells 
To measure steady-state levels of transfected retron ncR- 
NAs by northern blot, we designed 32 P-radiolabeled ssDNA 
probes complementary to the sgBFP scaffold sequence present 
in both the 106-nucleotide sgBFP transcript and the 334- 
nucleotide full-length fusion transcripts of sgBFP and msr-msd 
(Fig. 2 A). Pilot northern blot experiments revealed that co- 
delivery of Cas9 with sgBFP was required to stabilize sgR- 
NAs ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Based on this result, Cas9- 
RT mCherry plasmid was co-transfected in all subsequent 
experiments. We transfected plasmids encoding sgBFP, msr- 
msd-sgBFP, or sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNAs and extracted to- 
tal RNA for northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). The abun- 
dance of sgBFP, fused in either orientation, to msr-msd 
ncRNA was lower than sgBFP alone. We also observed that

either transient transfection of a plasmid or lo w-cop y integration of a lentivirus vector. 
while the U6 snRNA loading control showed no evidence of 
RNA degradation, there was a consistent pattern of inter- 
mediate length ncRNA products that were not observed in 
IVT RNA samples. We hypothesized that these intermediate- 
length products originated through degradation by endoge- 
nous nucleases rather than early transcription termination, 
as they were present even when probing the 3 ′ end of the 
ncRNA. 
ncRNA expression in a low-copy lentivirus integration cell 
line with an sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNA construct was compared 
to RNA expression from a cell line with low-copy integra- 
tions of sgBFP alone (Fig. 2 C). We detected a band corre- 
sponding to full-length sgBFP when expressed from a trans- 
fected plasmid and from an integrated locus; however, we 
were unable to detect the full-length sgBFP-msr-msd ncRNA 
when integrated despite being expressed from the same pro- 
moter and plasmid backbone as sgBFP. Taken together, these 
results were indicative of ncRNA degradation by endogenous 
nucleases. 
Efficient retron editing favors ncRNA architectures 
encoding sgRNAs with native 5 ′ ends 
To determine which elements of ncRNA architecture most 
strongly affected editing efficiency, we systematically tested 
different ncRNA designs by transient transfection of retron 
editor plasmids. Initially we compared editing efficiencies of 
cis or trans expression of the sgRNA and retron template. 
In this case, cis refers to a fusion transcript of sgRNA and 
retron msr-msd components, while trans refers to expression 
of sgRNA and retron msr-msd as two separate transcripts. 
For editing in the context of a fusion RNA, we were inter- 
ested in how orientation of the sgRNA relative to msr-msd 
might impact retron editing efficiency (i.e. msr -msd-sgBFP ver - 
sus sgBFP-msr-msd). 
We observed that with Cas9-RTwt the msr-msd-sgBFP ori- 
entation showed no significant increase in GFP+ cells as 
compared to Cas9-RTmut (0.36% ± 0.07% versus 0.37% 
± 0.04%), indicating that the GFP+ cells likely result from 
plasmid-templated repair in this context (Fig. 3 A). However, 
trans expression of the sgRNA and msr-msd from two differ- 
ent plasmids (sgBFP + msr-msd) and an sgBFP-msr-msd ori- 
entation had a marginal but statistically significant increase 
in editing efficiency (0.43% ± 0.08% and 0.64% ± 0.06%, 
respectively). These results demonstrate that the overall archi- 
tecture of the retron ncRNA favors an sgRNA with a native 
5 ′ end. 
The importance of the relative abundance of the sgRNA 
and retron RNA template is an aspect of retron-mediated 
genome editing that has not previously been explored. We ex- 
ploited our finding that retron ncRNA components are func- 
tional in trans to interrogate the relationship between ncRNA 
and sgRNA abundance and retron editing efficiency under 
conditions where one RNA is limiting. We packaged either 
sgBFP or msr-msd as lentivirus and transduced HEK293T- 
BFP cells at low MOI to bias toward low copy number. Sub- 
sequently, we transfected the cognate component to induce 
overexpression relative to the low copy integrated compo- 
nent (Fig. 3 B). When integrated and expressed with trans- 
fected Cas9-RT mCherry plasmid, sgBFP disrupted BFP at a 
mean frequency of 98.28% ± 0.14%, while conversely, the 
msr-msd-sgBFP fusion was unable to disrupt BFP at a fre- 
quency > 6.93% ± 0.15% (Fig. 3 C). Efficient BFP disrup- 
tion was restored when sgBFP was expressed with msr-msd 
template in trans by either transfection or integration. Over- 
all, templated editing efficiency from integrated constructs 
was less than 0.1% except when sgBFP was integrated in the 
genome and the msr-msd template was overexpressed by plas- 
mid transfection (Fig. 3 D). Under these conditions, templated 
repair overwhelmingly originates from RT-DNA, evidenced 
by a significant increase in GFP+ cells with Cas9-RTwt as 
compared to Cas9-RTmut that establishes the baseline level 
of plasmid templated repair. These results suggest that the 
msr-msd template levels could be limiting in human cells and 
that retron-mediated editing efficiency might be improved by 
increasing the abundance of the ncRNA. These results also 
indicate that fusion of the sgRNA to the retron msr-msd in- 
hibits Cas9 nuclease activity, potentially by interfering with 
efficient RNP assembly due to misfolding or steric hindrance 
[ 35 ].

Exoribonuclease-resistant RNA pseudoknot rescues 
Eco1 retron editor ncRNA steady-state levels 
Free 5 ′ and 3 ′ RNA ends are substrates for exoribonucle- 
ases and RNA sensing pathways [ 36 ]. We hypothesized that 
protecting free msr-msd ends would stabilize and increase 
msr-msd abundance and improve editing efficiency. Since the 
sgRNA is already protected by co-expression with Cas9, we 
focused on designs aimed at stabilizing the 5 ′ end of the msr- 
msd-sgRNA fusion orientation. This orientation also places 
the repair template proximal to the sgRNA spacer sequence, 
which is advantageous for molecular cloning. We tested three 
strategies of RNA protection found in nature: RNA circular- 
ization [ 37 ], 3 ′ polyadenylation [ 38 ], and RNA pseudoknots 
[ 39 ]. To generate a circular RNA (circRNA) construct, we 
took advantage of flanking transfer RNA (tRNA) ligation se- 
quences as endogenous tRNA ligase activity has previously 
been used to extend sgRNA half-life in cells [ 40 ]. Polyadenyla- 
tion of RNAPIII-expressed SINE transcripts has been achieved 
by the addition of a canonical AA T AAA polyA signal to the 3 ′ 
end of the transcript, and we reasoned that we could similarly 
take advantage of the stability provided by a polyA tail [ 38 ]. 
Finally, we tested three additional approaches incorporating 
stability-enhancing RNA pseudoknots on the 5 ′ end that all 
have been previously used to stabilize pegRNA transcripts and 
improve prime editing efficiency [ 9 , 41 ]. 
We tested five distinct ncRNA plasmids with the inten- 
tion of circularizing, polyadenylating, or pseudoknot protect- 
ing the retron editor ncRNA (Fig. 4 A) and tested the degree 
to which each construct stabilized Eco1 retron editor tran- 
scripts within the cellular environment. Total RNA was ex- 
tracted from HEK293T-BFP cells co-transfected with the dif- 
ferent msr-msd plasmids and either Cas9-RT or Cas9-RTmut. 
Steady-state RNA levels were probed by northern blot as de- 
scribed above (Fig. 4 B). 
Next, we compared editing efficiencies of these different 
stability-enhancing ncRNAs to msr-msd-sgBFP. When trans- 
fected with Cas9-RTwt, the xrRNA-msr-msd-sgBFP reached 
GFP editing rates as high as 1.83% ± 0.16%, representing 
a nearly three-fold improvement over the native unprotected 
ncRNA (Fig. 4 C). No other ncRNAs tested improved tem- 
plated editing rates, while the circRNA design exhibited re- 
duced performance due to significantly impaired Cas9 activity, 
resulting in < 0.1% editing efficiency. 
Since the xrRNA pseudoknot evolved in nature to block 
nuclease-mediated degradation of an RNA genome [ 42 , 43 ] 
we hypothesized that a similar mechanism could explain the 
increase in RNA abundance in this context. To test whether 
exonuclease resistance is required for the increase in edit- 
ing efficiency imparted by the xrRNA, we introduced a sin- 
gle point mutation (C20G) known to disrupt the pseudoknot 
three-way junction and decrease exonuclease resistance while 
maintaining overall secondary structure of the xrRNA stem–
loops [ 44 , 45 ] (Fig. 4 D, inset). To assess differences in half- 
life, we treated HEK293T cells expressing xrRNA or xrRNA 
C20G transcripts with dactinomycin to inhibit transcription 
and collected samples at multiple time points over 8 hours for 
analysis. Total RNA was extracted and the abundance of each 
transcript was quantitated by reverse transcription followed 
by qPCR. The xrRNA C20G transcript rapidly decreased 
in abundance by single-phase exponential decay ( R 2 = 0.99)

with an apparent half-life of 20 min (16.8–24 95% CI) (Fig. 
4 D). In contrast, the xrRNA transcript decreased in a sub- 
exponential manner, reaching approximately one-third of the 
initial quantity by 8 h. The increased stability of the xrRNA 
transcript compared to the xrRNA C20G transcript coin- 
cided with a steady-state abundance ∼27-fold greater (Fig. 
4 E). Functionally, the C20G point mutation abolished any in- 
crease in editing efficiency, supporting exonuclease resistance 
as the aspect of the xrRNA-msd-msd-sgBFP ncRNA that en- 
hances retron editing efficiency (Fig. 4 F). 
Csy4 cleavage and pseudoknot protection enable 
Eco1 retron editing without double-strand breaks 
Despite the improvements in xrRNA-msd-msr-sgBFP abun- 
dance and editing efficiency in the context of transient plasmid 
transfection, when integrated by lentivirus this design showed 
low BFP disruption rates of 13.06% ± 0.28% and an absence 
of templated repair as a likely consequence of this modifica- 
tion ( Supplementary Fig. S4 A). Based on prior reports that 
sgRNA activity is reduced by 5 ′ extensions [ 35 ] and given our 
results demonstrating reduced BFP disruption in the context 
of 5 ′ sgBFP fusions, we reasoned that Cas9 activity might be if 
the msr-msd RNA was enzymatically cleaved from the sgRNA 
after transcription, thereby liberating the sgRNA and mini- 
mizing 5 ′ sgRNA extension. 
We explored multiple strategies to cleave the msr-msd- 
sgBFP including tRNA sequences that have natural process- 
ing of their 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends by cellular RNases [ 46 ], as well 
as the Csy4 endoribonuclease that cleaves at a specific 20-nt 
stem–loop sequence [ 47 ]. We tested three processable retron 
editor ncRNAs: two tRNA sequences and one Csy4-cleavable 
transcript. tRNAPro represents a full-length prolyl tRNA se- 
quence between the template and sgRNA, while dC55G in- 
corporates an engineered prolyl tRNA with reduced inter- 
nal promoter activity and improved RNA processing [ 48 ]. 
When co-transfected with Cas9-RT and a plasmid express- 
ing wild-type Csy4, the Csy4-cleavable retron editor ncRNA 
(msr-msd-csy4-sgBFP) showed marginal improvements in RT- 
dependent templated repair as compared to an unprocessed 
ncRNA ( Supplementary Fig. S4 B). This improvement is Csy4 
cleavage dependent, as increased editing was not observed 
when co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a nuclease de- 
ficient Csy4 mutant (Csy4-H29A). Processing the sgRNA to 
minimize 5 ′ extension serves to further improve editing effi- 
ciency of the Eco1 retron editor ncRNA. 
To overcome the limitations of low steady-state RNA and 
limited Cas9 nuclease activity due to fusion ncRNA retron 
editor architectures, we combined the strategies of pseudo- 
knot protection and Csy4 cleavage into a single ncRNA con- 
struct: xrRNA-msr -msd-csy4-sgBFP (Fig. 5 A), wherein an xr - 
RNA pseudoknot is grafted onto the 5 ′ end of the msr-msd

template and a Csy4 recognition site is interposed between 
the template and the sgRNA. We also tested xrRNA-msr-msd- 
evopreQ-Csy4-sgBFP, which incorporates an additional pseu- 
doknot on the 3 ′ end of the template that is exposed after 
Csy4 cleavage for additional nuclease protection of the mature 
msr-msd. 
In HEK293T-BFP cells transiently transfected with the en- 
hanced Eco1 retron editor, we observed a 2.26-fold increase 
in templated editing (Fig. 5 B), while in the K562-BFP chronic 
myelogenous leukemia cell line transfected with the improved 
Eco1 retron editor, we observed a 10.63-fold increase in 
templated editing (Fig. 5 C). Contrary to our initial expecta- 
tions and our findings in K562-BFP cells, we observed con- 
sistently greater templated editing in HEK293T-BFP cells co- 
transfected with Csy4-H29A versus wild-type Csy4. This re- 
sult led us to consider whether reduced sgRNA efficiency 
could be beneficial in certain contexts by limiting the occur- 
rence of dead-end NHEJ outcomes prior to RT-DNA forma- 
tion. When tested in low-copy HEK293T-BFP cell lines, the en- 
hanced Eco1 xrRNA-msr-msd-evopreQ-csy4-sgBFP construct 
led to a 27-fold increase in templated editing when com- 
pared to the native Eco1 retron editor ncRNA (Fig. 5 D). In 
a similar experiment conducted in K562-BFP cells, we ob- 
served BFP disruption frequencies of templated editing rates 
of 1.33% ± 0.03% versus < 0.01% using the unoptimized 
ncRNA construct (Fig. 5 E). 
Finally, we hypothesized that this improved editing effi- 
ciency could enable editing without introducing double-strand 
breaks. We mutated the Cas9-RT mCherry vectors to encode 
the H840A nickase mutant (nCas9) and discovered that in 
HEK293T-BFP cells (Fig. 5 F) and in K562-BFP cells (Fig. 5 G) 
it was possible to achieve precise genome editing without ev- 
ident BFP disruption. Amplicon sequencing confirmed indel 
frequency of ∼5% ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Editing in the 
context of nCas9-RT was entirely dependent on a functional 
RT, 5 ′ xrRNA, and Csy4 processing. 
Discussion 
Retron-mediated genome editing is an emerging biotechnol- 
ogy that complements existing tools for precision rewriting of 
genomic DNA. Retrons generate short ssDNA in situ for tem- 
plated repair, leading to predictable editing outcomes and en- 
abling applications that require large and complex DNA edits 
in diverse sequence contexts. Previously, retron editors have 
been used to introduce missense mutations in human cells but 
their utility is limited by poor efficiency when compared to 
orthologous systems expressed in bacteria and yeast [ 20 , 22 ]. 
In this study, we identified unstable Eco1 ncRNA as a factor 
influencing low efficiency of templated genome editing in hu- 
man cells. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a series 
of retron ncRNA variants to incorporate stability-enhancing 
secondary structures including a nuclease-resistant RNA pseu- 
doknot from the Zika virus 3 ′ UTR that robustly rescued 
steady-state RNA levels in the context of transfected and sta- 
bly integrated constructs. We further identified impaired Cas9 
endonuclease activity in the context of a chimeric msr-msd- 
sgRNA fusion transcript and evaluated strategies to restore 
the native ends of both RNAs. Enhanced editing required the 
Csy4 endoribonuclease to enzymatically process the sgRNA 
from the retron ncRNA components, which rescued Cas9 ac- 
tivity when the RNA components were expressed as a single 
transcript. Combining these approaches enabled efficient pre- 
cision genome editing by transient transfection, editing from a 
lentiviral vector integrated at low copy, and editing without in- 
troducing double-strand breaks when co-transfected with the 
Cas9 H840A nickase (nCas9-RT) mutant [ 49 ]. 
The utility of genome editing technologies based on 
CRISPR–Cas systems has been expanded by fusing various en- 
zymes to Cas9 to recruit enzymatic activities to target DNA. 
In the case of prime editing, this also requires extending the 
sgRNA from the 3 ′ end to encode information for reverse 
transcriptase priming and the recombination template, which 
is referred to as a pegRNA [ 7 ]. The 3 ′ components of a pe- 
gRNA are exposed to degradation by endogenous nucleases 
[ 41 ]. Previous studies have identified approaches to protect the 
3 ′ ends of pegRNAs including extension by RNA secondary 
structures and overexpression of the small RNA-binding ex- 
onuclease protection factor La [ 50 ]. In the present study, stabi- 
lization of the sgRNA was not required as it is protected when 
co-expressed with Cas9-RT; instead, we employed a strategy 
to protect both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of the Eco1 ncRNA, which, 
in this context, significantly outperformed the native ncRNA. 
Recent studies have shown that 3 ′ truncated pegRNAs are 
preferentially loaded into Cas9 and that pegRNAs with strong 
5 ′ and 3 ′ complementarity could circularize into a structure 
similar to retron ncRNA:sgRNA fusions [ 51 ,52 ]. These find- 
ings are consistent with our data that ncRNA:sgRNA fusions 
and circRNAs are relatively inefficient as Cas9 guide RNAs. 
Further improvements in efficiency may also be realized 
through rational design, directed evolution, or metagenomic 
studies aimed at increasing the efficiency and processivity of 
reverse transcription in human cells or by increasing the suit- 
ability of the msDNA structure as a substrate for templated 
repair. Since the msDNA arises from the ncRNA, we expect 
RT improvements to complement ncRNA stabilization. We 
believe that it will be possible to enhance the genome editing 
utility of retron editors by using PAM-expanded Cas variants, 
harnessing the intrinsic RNase activity of Cas12a to stream- 
line RNA processing [ 53 ], and / or implementing alternative 
promoter strategies to overcome the processivity limitations 
of the U6 promoter [ 32 ]. 
This study investigated the limitations of Eco1 retron- 
mediated genome editing in human cells. Through system- 
atic modifications and comparative assessments, we have 
identified key factors influencing the efficiency of a model 
retron editor. Incorporating RNA-stabilizing pseudoknots and 
Csy4 cleavage yielded an enhanced Eco1 retron editor ca- 
pable of writing sequences to the genome without double- 
strand breaks. Genome editing tools that rely on double- 
strand breaks to introduce templated missense mutations are 
limited by a general preference for NHEJ as a repair mecha- 
nism, which biases editing outcomes away from the intended 
edit [ 54 , 55 ]. This advance in retron editing resolves one of 
the most significant limitations of the technology by reducing 
the frequency of unproductive editing outcomes.
