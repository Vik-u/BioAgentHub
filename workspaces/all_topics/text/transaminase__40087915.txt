ABSTRACT
We analysed the frequency, severity and impact of hepatitis flares in a large Phase 2 study investigating pegylated interferon- 
alfa- 2a (PEG- IFNa) for the treatment of hepatitis D. In the HIDIT- II study, 120 patients were treated for 96 weeks with PEG- IFNa 
(180 μg weekly) in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 300 mg once daily) or placebo. Hepatitis flares were de-
fined as ALT increases above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more than 2.5- fold above baseline or nadir values. 
ALT flares occurred in 28 patients (23%) during treatment (< 96) and in 14 patients post- treatment until follow- up Week 24. There 
were no differences in the flare frequency between the two treatment arms (12 PEG- IFNa + placebo vs. 16 PEG- IFNa + TDF). The 
frequency of ALT increases did not differ between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. None of the patients with cirrhosis expe -
rienced liver decompensation during or after a flare. Fifty- four per cent of the patients with ALT flare experienced a decrease in 
HDV RNA (> 1 log10 cop/ml) during subsequent study visits. Mean ALT levels early during treatment were higher in patients with 
HBsAg loss at follow- up Week 24. More than a third of hepatitis D patients undergoing PEG- IFNa therapy may experience ALT 
flares during or after treatment. ALT flares in this study posed no obvious safety risk to patients and should not lead to premature 
withdrawal from treatment. If ALT flares may be beneficial in single patients requires further investigation.

1   |   Introduction
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares, defined as a sudden in -
crease in ALT levels, are well known to occur frequently during 
interferon (IFN) based therapies in patients with hepatitis C and 
hepatitis B [1–5]. IFN- induced ALT flares are described as a con-
sequence of the immunological stimulation of interferon, which 
leads to increased natural killer cell activation and cytolytic T- 
cell activity [3, 6, 7].
ALT flares have been described in untreated hepatitis B 
mono- infected patients [ 8, 9 ], as well as during or after an -
tiviral therapy. In PEG-  IFNa-  treated patients, ALT flares 
occur in 25%–40% of patients, mostly in hepatitis B e antigen 
(HBeAg)-  negative patients, during the 2nd–3rd month of ther -
apy [3, 9–11].
Hepatitis D, which only occurs as either a coinfection or super -
infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is considered the most 
severe and rapidly progressing form of viral hepatitis, leading 
to advanced liver disease and the development of cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ 12]. Although Hepatitis D is 
considered an orphan disease, it poses a major health burden in 
some regions. Approximately 5% of 240 million monoinfected 
individuals are coinfected with HDV [ 13].
Pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-  IFNa) and bulevirtide are 
the only treatment options for patients with chronic hepatitis 
D infections [ 14], with a variable virological response rate of 
17%–47% for IFN [15–17].
In the largest randomised treatment trial investigating PEG- 
IFNa in hepatitis D, the Hep-  Net- International- Delta- Hepatitis- 
Intervention- study II (HIDIT-  II) 120 patients were treated with 
PEG- IFNa and tenofovir (TDF) or placebo for 96 weeks. The 
primary endpoint, HDV RNA negativity at the end of treat -
ment, was achieved in 48% of patients in the PEG-  IFNa plus 
TDF group and in 33% of the PEG- IFNa plus placebo group [16]. 
Of note, ALT flares were observed during and after treatment 
in the patient cohort. To analyse the role and consequences of 
ALT flares in patients with hepatitis D and evaluate their cor -
relation with treatment outcomes for HDV- infected patients, we 
conducted a thorough analysis of the ALT flares in 120 patients 
enrolled in the HIDIT- II study.

2.1   |   Study Population
We here performed a subanalysis of the patients included in the 
HIDIT- II trial (EudraCT 2008–005560- 13). Initially, 120 chronic 
hepatitis D patients were included in the study. All patients were 
treated for 96 weeks with PEG- IFNa (180 μg once weekly) and 
tenofovir dipivoxil (TDF) (300 mg daily) or placebo. Patients were 
observed for 24 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT). Details

2.2   |   ALT Flares Definition
Alanine aminotransferase flares were defined as increases 
above 10 times the upper limit of normal or increases of more 
than 2.5-  fold above baseline or nadir values. Patients were 
grouped into patients with ALT flares during treatment (until 
Week 96) (Group I), patients with ALT flares after treatment 
(> 96 until Week 120) (Group II) and patients without ALT flares 
(Group III). Patients who experienced multiple flares during and 
after treatment were grouped into Group I.
2.3   |   Responses and Consequences of ALT Flares
Virological responses related to ALT flares were defined as a de-
cline or increase during the next two visits after the flares. Cut- offs 
for virological responses were defined as an HDV RNA decline of 
more than 1 log or an HBsAg change of more than 0.5 log.
Direct clinical consequences of the ALT flares were defined as 
follows: Dose reduction of the study medication, bilirubin ele -
vation > 3 mg/dL and INR elevation above 1.5 during the flares.
2.4   |   Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using standard statistical 
methods (GraphPad 6.0 [GraphPad Software]). All parameters 
were described as mean +/− SD. p- Values < 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. Continuous parametric variables were 
analysed by t- tests or ANOVA. A chi- square test was calculated 
for the comparison of discrete variables. In case of an expected 
cell count < 5, Fisher's exact test was used instead.
2.5   |   Ethics
Details of the study design and patient recruitment are given in 
[16]. All patients provided written informed consent before en -
rolment. The HIDIT-  II study protocol conforms to the ethical 
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a 
priori approval by the ethics committee.

3.1   |   Treatment Arms and Baseline Characteristics
From all HIDIT-  II patients (n = 120; 59 PEG-  IFNa/TDF and 61 
PEG- IFNa/placebo), 28 patients experienced ALT flares until 
treatment Week 96 (Group I), 21% ( n = 12) of the PEG-  IFNa 
TDF- treated patients and 26% (n = 16) of the PEG- IFNa placebo- 
treated ones ( p = 0.52; OR 0.72 95% CI 0.31–1.69). Fourteen per 
cent (n = 4) of the patients who experienced an ALT flare during 
treatment underwent further flares after the end of the treat -
ment. Two patients were excluded from the analysis as they did 
not complete the 96- week treatment (Figure 1). Fourteen further 
patients experienced an ALT flare after the end of treatment be -
tween Weeks 96 and 120. Here, ALT flares occurred more often 
in the PEG-  IFNa placebo arm, 18% ( n = 11) versus 5% (n = 3) in 
the TDF arm (p = 0.04; OR 0.24 95% CI 0.06–0.92).
Overall, 73.1% of the patients who experienced ALT flares during 
treatment and 50% of those patients with ALT flares after treat -
ment were male with a mean age of 38.3 or 41.5 years. Table  1 
displays all baseline characteristics of the analysed group with 
no significant differences between the analysed groups and the 
overall HIDIT-  II population (ANOVA test). Individual charac -
teristics of all 26 patients with ALT flares during treatment are 
shown in the supplement (Table S1).
3.2   |   Natural Course and Diversity of ALT Flares
Three types of ALT flares (10× ULN; 2.5 > BL and 2.5 > nadir) 
were defined in this analysis. Figure  2 shows the individual 
courses of ALT, HDV RNA and HBsAg in 26 patients of Group 
I. Courses of the 14 patients of Group II are displayed in the 
Supporting Information (Figure  S1). Three of the 14 patients in 
Group II underwent retreatments at the physician's discretion (1 
with IFN/1 with TDF and 1 with PEG-  IFNa + TDF). However, 
ALT flares in these patients occurred before PEG-  IFNa retreat-
ment. We observed a high diversity in the kind and time point 
of ALT flares within the analysed groups, reaching from one 
single flare at one defined time point (e.g., Patients Rd1, Rd17, 
etc) to sustained flares (e.g., Patients Rd58 and Rd77) or multi -
ple flares, such as in Patient Rd6 or Rd30. Patients with multi -
ple flares were all male; 4/7 had cirrhosis at baseline, but the 
numbers are too small to draw conclusions from this. Only four 
patients (Rd5, Rd30, Rd36 and Rd97) (all male) had both on-   
and off-  treatment flares. One of four of these individuals had 
liver cirrhosis, and none of these patients had HBsAg loss (see 
Figure 2 and Table S1).
A preliminary investigation of all patients who exhibited an ALT 
flare revealed a marginal tendency towards earlier onset among 
women compared to men. However, the number of women in 
the group is too small to prove this statistically (Table  S1). The 
diversity and timing of these flares highlight the complexity and 
variability of ALT activity in these patients. Laboratory findings 
due to ALT flares, such as bilirubin elevation, were observed in 
2 of the 26 patients (Figure  2). Therapy adjustments took place 
in eight patients, also shown in Figure 2. None of the patients de-
veloped hepatic decompensation or liver failure associated with 
the ALT flares.
3.3   |   Impact of ALT Flares on the Therapy 
Outcome
Among the 26 ALT flare patients, 16 (61%) were HDV RNA neg-
ative at EOT and still 11 (42%) at follow- up Week 120. Four pa -
tients (15%) showed HBsAg loss at EOT.
To determine if an ALT flare directly impacts viral load, we 
analysed the values of the three visits subsequent to the flares. 
Fourteen (54%) patients experienced a decline of more than 
4 of 8 Journal of Viral Hepatitis, 2025
1 log HDV RNA after the flares. Of these 14 patients, only six 
(43%) displayed a more than 0.5 log decline in HBsAg in addition 
(Figure 3).
Furthermore, there was no significant difference in HDV 
RNA ( p = 0.15) or HBsAg ( p = 0.29) levels at EOT or FU120 
between flare and nonflare patients. Interestingly, comparing 
the time point and magnitude of the ALT flares of patients 
who cleared HDV RNA or HBsAg at EOT with pooled flare 
patients, we were able to show that patients with HBsAg loss 
at EOT showed an early (around Week 8) and higher ALT flare 
(Figure  4). Patients with HBsAg loss at EOT showed at Week 8 
of therapy mean ALT ULN values of 16.57 (range 2.6–41.74) 
and patients without HBsAg loss 4.48 (range 0.89–14.60, 
p = 0.03).
3.4   |   ALT Flares in Cirrhotic Patients
In the HIDIT- II population, liver cirrhosis at baseline was pres -
ent in 48 (41%) patients [16]. In the here analysed patient cohort, 
flare frequency (including posttreatment flares) was nearly sim -
ilar in patients with 44% (18/41) or without cirrhosis, 34% (22/65) 
(p = 0.57). Treatment adjustment or bilirubin elevation was not 
more frequent in flare patients with cirrhosis. Importantly, ALT 
flares did not lead to prolonged hepatic impairments or decom -
pensations in any case, as described previously [ 16].
Notably, the cirrhotic patients experienced the ALT flares sig -
nificantly later; 8/10 patients after Week 12 than the noncir -
rhotic patients, 4/11 (p = 0.009); see Figure S2.
4   |   Discussion
ALT flares are a common phenomenon during or after treat -
ment with Type I interferons in patients with HBV infection. 
ALT flares have not been studied in detail in HBV/HDV coin -
fected patients treated with PEG-  IFNa. We have analysed 
the frequency, severity and impact on virological outcomes 
of ALT flares in the so far largest, international, multicentre 
clinical trial investigating PEG-  IFNa- 2a treatment in hepatitis

D patients—the HIDIT-  II clinical trial [ 16]. The key findings 
of this analysis are (i) that ALT flares may occur in approx -
imately 25% of patients in the first 24 weeks of PEG-  IFNa 
treatment, and in an additional 10%–15% of patients during 
follow- up after treatment, (ii) that these ALT flares did not 
result in any liver failure—even in patients with cirrhosis, but 
(iii) that ALT flares may be considered as beneficial as more 
than half of the patients showed a HDV RNA decline within 
two visits after an ALT flare, and some patients who experi -
enced flares also lost HBsAg.
About a quarter of HBV patients experience ALT flares during 
or after treatment with PEG-  IFNa [2, 4, 18]. This frequency ap -
pears to be comparable to what we observed in the HIDIT-  II 
study for patients who were coinfected with HBV and HDV. 
Although we did not find baseline differences between flare and 
nonflare patients, our results are consistent with the time point 
of ALT flares in HBV mono- infected patients and their potential 
beneficial impact on HbsAg loss [ 4]. However, ALT flares were 
rarely observed in the first HIDIT-  I trial [15]. Given the compa-
rable rates of flares detected in both treatment arms, this unfore-
seen alteration cannot be explained by the different anti-  HBV 
nucleotides used in HIDIT- II (tenofovir dipivoxil) versus HIDIT 
1 (adefovir). The frequency of on-  treatment and off-  treatment 
ALT flares in the context of treatment with PEG-  IFNa seems 
not to differ substantially between HDV coinfected patients and 
individuals with hepatitis B alone.
Importantly, in the HIDIT-  II trial, ALT flares did not lead to 
any hepatic decompensation or liver failure, even in cirrhotic 
patients. Still, dose adjustments of PEG-  IFNa according to 
the label must be performed and we strongly recommend that 
management of PEG-  IFNa therapy should be managed by ex -
perienced physicians, in particular if there is evidence of portal 
hypertension [14]. The presence of compensated liver cirrhosis 
should not be an exclusion criterion for PEG-  IFNa therapy for 
hepatitis D. In the HIDIT-  II trial, cirrhosis was not a negative 
response factor [ 16]. Similarly, also in HBV monoinfection, 
patients with liver cirrhosis respond equally well to PEG-  IFNa 
therapy [19].
Despite extensive discussion, the underlying causes of ALT 
flares during PEG-  IFNa therapy remain elusive. One theory 
suggests that PEG-  IFNa treatment led to the activation of NK 
cells. The frequency of distinct NK cell subpopulations and 
phenotypic and functional changes during IFN therapy was as -
sociated with the response to the treatment of hepatitis D with 
PEG- IFNa [20]. In the context of PEG- IFNa therapy for hepatitis 
B monoinfection, boosting innate immune responses has also 
been shown [21]. Boosted virus- specific T- cell responses leading 
to ALT flares have also been discussed as an alternative expla -
nation. However, this has not yet been confirmed for PEG-  IFN 
treatment in either HCV or HBV patients.
The data presented here are significant in the current land -
scape of combination therapies involving PEG-  IFN for hep -
atitis D. In July 2023, the PEG-  IFN Lambda Phase 3 clinical 
trial was stopped after a safety review by the DSMB due to 
frequent ALT flares and high numbers of decompensated pa -
tients. Additionally, because of the synergistic way that IFN and 
Bulevirtide work together, it is vital to understand ALT flares 
[22, 23]. Combinations with Bulevirtide are not only discussed 
but also combinations with other compounds like siRNAs have 
been investigated in HBV-  infected patients with great success. 
Given the growing enthusiasm for PEG-  IFN as a companion 
therapy, it is of paramount importance to investigate the safety 
aspects of ALT flares. The mode of action between different 
hepatitis D treatments might be a factor in the ALT flare induc -
tion. It has been demonstrated that ALT flares were beneficial 
in the treatment of hepatitis D with the REP2139 compound 
together with PEG-  IFN [24]. Whereas, in the REEF-  D clinical 
trial, ALT flares that occurred during the treatment with siRNA 
against HbsAg were associated with HDV RNA rebound that 
resulted in early treatment discontinuation in eight patients 
[25]. The impact and safety of a hepatitis flare must be judged 
by the distinct mode of action.

There are obvious strengths and limitations to this analysis. The 
assessment of ALT flares within a large prospective, multicentre 
trial from different countries in Europe, the investigation of a 
population with a significant number of patients with cirrhosis 
and centralised lab testing are some of the strengths. There are 
limitations that should be named, such as the retrospective na -
ture of the analysis, the limited overall number of patients in the 
distinct subgroups and the lack of detailed immunological or cell 
death markers analysis explaining flares [ 26]. It can be argued 
that a 1 log decrease in HDV RNA is too little to be considered 
a significant change, particularly when it comes to HDV RNA 
assays' widely varying sensitivities [ 27]. In order to identify pa -
tients who have a virological response to IFN- based therapy, the 
relative log drop in viral loads is still very comparable.
In summary, PEG-  IFNa is still one of the main cornerstones of 
the treatment approaches for hepatitis D. ALT flares may occur 
during the treatment, but should not lead to premature discon -
tinuation of PEG-  IFNa treatment. The treatment management 
of hepatitis D patients still needs to consider ALT flares. Further 
investigation is needed to determine the frequency and severity 
of flares as well as the relationship with late-  onset flares in cir -
rhotic patients, especially in the context of combination thera -
pies with other novel antiviral approaches.
