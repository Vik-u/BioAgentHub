Abstract 
Chiral phenylglycinol is a very important chemical in the pharmaceutical manufacturing. Current methods for 
synthesis of chiral phenylglycinol often suffered from unsatisfied selectivity, low product yield and using the non-
renewable resourced substrates, then the synthesis of chiral phenylglycinol remain a grand challenge. Design and 
construction of synthetic microbial consortia is a promising strategy to convert bio-based materials into high value-
added chiral compounds. In this study, we reported a six-step artificial cascade biocatalysis system for conversion of 
bio-based l-phenylalanine into chiral phenylglycinol. This system was designed using a microbial consortium includ-
ing two engineered recombinant Escherichia coli cell modules, one recombinant E. coli cell module co-expressed 
six different enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia lyase/ferulic acid decarboxylase/phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase/
styrene monooxygenase/epoxide hydrolase/alcohol dehydrogenase) for efficient conversion of l-phenylalanine 
into 2-hydroxyacetophenone. The second recombinant E. coli cell module expressed an (R)-ω-transaminase or co-
expressed the (S)-ω-transaminase, alanine dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase for conversion of 2-hydroxy-
acetophenone into (S)- or (R)-phenylglycinol, respectively. Combining the two engineered E. coli cell modules, after 
the optimization of bioconversion conditions (including pH, temperature, glucose concentration, amine donor 
concentration and cell ratio), l-phenylalanine could be easily converted into (R)-phenylglycinol and (S)-phenylglycinol 
with up to 99% conversion and > 99% ee. Preparative scale biotransformation was also conducted on 100-mL scale, 
(S)-phenylglycinol and (R)-phenylglycinol could be obtained in 71.0% and 80.5% yields, > 99% ee, and 5.19 g/L d and 
4.42 g/L d productivity, respectively. The salient features of this biocatalytic cascade system are good yields, excellent 
ee, mild reaction condition and no need for additional cofactor (NADH/NAD+), provide a practical biocatalytic method 
for sustainable synthesis of (S)-phenylglycinol and (R)-phenylglycinol from bio-based L-phenylalanine.

Introduction
Chiral vicinal amino alcohol moieties are important 
structural features of many pharmaceutically active mol -
ecules and natural products (Bergmeier et al. 2000; Gupta 
et al. 2018); besides, they can be used as chiral ligands or 
auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis (Tan et  al. 2017). In 
this context, enantiopure phenylglycinols are particu -
larly interesting due to their potential use as a key build -
ing block for many pharmaceuticals synthesis, such as

neurotrophic agent (Panek et al. 1998), h5-HT1D recep -
tor agonists (Russell et al. 1999), antimitotic agents (Kim 
et al. 2004) and p21-activated kinases (PAK4) inhibitors 
(Guo et al. 2017).
The industrial synthesis of vicinal amino alcohols typi -
cally uses chemical methods. These methods mainly 
include reduction of amino acids (McKennon et al. 1993; 
Vandekerkhove et  al. 2018), asymmetric ring-opening 
of epoxides (Overman et  al. 1985; Jacobsen et  al. 2000), 
addition of lithiated aziridines to boronic esters (Schmidt 
et  al. 2009), addition of nucleophiles to aminocarbonyls 
(Reetz et  al. 1991) and imines (Kobayashi et  al. 1998), 
and asymmetric aminohydroxylation (AA) of styrene (Li 
et al. 1996; Sharpless et al. 1975). However, the conven -
tional chemical methods for the synthesis of chiral vicinal 
amino alcohols are often affected by unsatisfied regiose -
lectivity and enantioselectivity, low product yield, and 
the toxicity of the metal catalyst and N-protected amino 
alcohol product. Therefore, the chemical methods used 
for the industrial synthesis of chiral vicinal amino alco -
hols are considered to be non-viable for industrial appli -
cation purposes. However, biocatalysis has been widely 
used in the synthesis of many useful chemicals, and it 
is a more sustainable method compared to the above-
mentioned methods (You et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2020). 
In the past two decades, various biocatalytic alternatives 
have been reported for the synthesis of chiral vicinal 
amino alcohols, such as racemic amino alcohol kinetic 
resolution (Wu et al. 2017; Rouf et al. 2011), chiral amino 
ketones asymmetric reduction (Patel et  al. 1993), and 
α-ketol asymmetric reduction amination (Zhang et  al. 
2019a; Chen et al. 2019). Recently, two types of biocata -
lytic cascades for the synthesis of chiral vicinal amino 
alcohols have been developed via asymmetric ring-open -
ing of epoxides (Zhang et  al. 2019b) and asymmetric 
aminohydroxylation of alkenes (Zhang et  al. 2020). The 
results of these studies showed good conversion percent -
ages (up to 99%) and ee values (> 99%) of amino alcohol 
products from the tested epoxides and alkenes. Although 
the substrates (i.e., epoxides and alkenes) used in these 
methods are not expensive and readily available, these 
substrates are mainly produced from non-renewable car -
bon resources. Consequently, these methods can be less 
sustainable compared to other techniques. Therefore, 
there is a need to find new biocatalytic strategies for syn -
thesizing chiral vicinal amino alcohols from sustainable 
resources.
l-α-Amino acids are bio-based materials that can 
be produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates 
or waste protein sources (Pelckmans et  al. 2017). In 
fact, the annual worldwide amino acids production is 
about four million tons (Becker et al. 2012). Therefore, 
the bio-based l -α-amino acids can make a significant 
contribution to the economic and ecological produc -
tion of chemical products and materials. In the past 
decades, several methods have been developed for 
converting l-α-amino acids into other high added-
value compounds (Fotheringham et  al. 2006; Studte 
et  al. 2008; Zhang et  al. 2019c ). For example, cascade 
biocatalysis processes have been used for conversion 
of l-phenylalanine into chiral styrene oxides, 1-phe -
nylethane-1,2-diols, mandelic acids and phenylgly -
cines (Zhou et  al. 2016). Tan et  al. (2021) described 
an in  vivo four-enzyme cascade pathway for efficient 
conversion of l -tyrosine to d -p-hydroxyphenylglycine. 
For instance, these authors reported d-p-hydroxy-
phenylglycine conversion and ee  percentages of 92.5% 
and > 99% from 50  g/L l-tyrosine, respectively (Tan 
et  al. 2021). Moreover, a whole-cell cascade biocataly -
sis system was established for efficient production of 
glutarate (yield = 43.8 g/L) from l-lysine with a recom -
binant E. coli microbial consortium by applying a fed-
batch strategy (Wang et al. 2019). Recently, Sekar et al. 
(2020) developed a one-pot cascade biotransformation 
process for conversion of l -phenylalanine to chiral 
phenylglycinol for the first time. About 42% conversion 
of (R )-phenylglycinol (99% ee ) and 26% conversion of 
(S)-phenylglycinol (92% ee ) were obtained from l-phe-
nylalanine using engineered E. coli strains (Sekar et al. 
2020). Unfortunately, the low substrate loadings, pro -
ductivity and ee  values significantly limit the industrial 
application of this process. Therefore, there is a need to 
develop more efficient biocatalysis systems for the syn -
thesis of chiral phenylglycinol from l -phenylalanine.
In this study, a novel artificially designed cascade 
biocatalysis system was constructed for conversion of 
bio-based l-phenylalanine into chiral phenylglycinol. 
This system was designed using a microbial consor -
tium including two recombinant E. coli cell modules 
(Scheme  1). One recombinant E. coli cell module 
co-expressed the following six enzymes: phenylala -
nine ammonia lyase (PAL), ferulic acid decarboxylase 
(Fdc1), phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase (Pad1), sty -
rene monooxygenase (SMO), epoxide hydrolase (EH), 
and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). This module was 
used for achieving an efficient conversion of l -phe-
nylalanine (L-PA, 1 ) into 2-hydroxyacetophenone 
(2-HAP , 6). The second recombinant E. coli cell module 
expressed the (R )-ω-transaminase or co-expressed the 
(S)-ω-transaminase, alanine dehydrogenase, and glu -
cose dehydrogenase for conversion purposes of 2-HAP 
6 into (S )- or (R )-phenylglycinol, respectively. Moreo -
ver, when combining these two recombinant E . coli 
modules, l-phenylalanine could be easily transformed 
to (R)-phenylglycinol and (S )-phenylglycinol with good 
conversion and excellent ee  values.

All the primers used in this study were synthesized by 
Tsingke (Beijing, China) and listed in Additional file  1: 
Table S1. All the constructed plasmids and recombinant 
E. coli cells are listed in Additional file  1: Table S2. E. coli 
(GoSCR), E. coli (GDH) (Cui et al. 2017), E. coli (MVTA)

PAL, Fdc1, and Pad1 were then amplified by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) using the primers listed in Addi -
tional file  1: Table S1. After, the PCR products were iso -
lated, double digested with the restriction endonucleases

(NdeI and XhoI), and ligated into pET28a (+), which 
were further digested with the same restriction enzymes. 
The resulting recombinant plasmids (pET28a-PAL, 
pET28a-Fdc1 and pET28a-Pad1) were separately trans -
formed into the competent E. coli T7 to form E. coli 
(PAL), E. coli (Fdc1), and E. coli (Pad1).
For the design of E. coli (AlaDH), the genome DNA 
was extracted from Bacillus subtilis sp. 168 by using a 
Bacterial DNA extraction kit supplied by Sangon Bio -
tech (China). After, the DNA fragment of the AlaDH 
(alanine dehydrogenase) gene was amplified from the 
genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis sp. 168 with PCR 
using the primers shown in Additional file  1: Table  S1. 
The PCR product was isolated and double digested with 
BamHI and PstI. After, it was ligated into the expression 
vector pETduet-1 at the BamHI/PstI sites to form the 
recombinant pETduet-AlaDH. The constructed recom -
binant plasmid pETduet-AlaDH was then transformed 
into the competent E. coli T7 to form the recombinant 
E. coli (pETduet-AlaDH). In addition, the recombinant E. 
coli (pCDFduet-AlaDH) was constructed using a similar 
procedure.
Moreover, the recombinant E. coli (Fdc1-Pad1) was 
designed by amplifying the DNA fragments of Fdc1 and 
Pad1 with PCR using the primers listed in Additional 
file  1: Table  S1. The Fdc1 gene was double-digested 
with the BamHI and NotI and ligated into the pRSF -
duet-1 at the BamHI/NotI sites to form the recombinant 
pRSFduet-Fdc1. In addition, the Pad1 gene was double-
digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI and 
XhoI and ligated into pRSFduet-Fdc1 at the BamHI/
XhoI sites to form the pRSFduet-Fdc1-Pad1 (named as 
RFP). Furthermore, the recombinant plasmid pRSFduet-
Fdc1-Pad1 was then transformed into the competent E. 
coli T7 to form the recombinant E. coli (pRSFduet-Fdc1-
Pad1) cells, designated as E. coli (RFP). Furthermore, the 
recombinant E. coli (pETduet-Fdc1-Pad1) (designated as 
E. coli (DFP)) and E. coli (pCDFduet-Fdc1-Pad1) (desig -
nated as E. coli (CFP)) were constructed in a similar way.
In the case of E. coli (pETduet-SpEH-PAL), the DNA 
fragments of both epoxide hydrolase (SpEH) and PAL 
enzymes were amplified with PCR using the prim -
ers shown in Additional file  1: Table S1. The SpEH gene 
was double-digested with the restriction endonucleases 
BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pETduet-1 at the 
BamHI/HindIII sites to form the recombinant pETduet-
SpEH. Also, the PAL gene was double-digested with NdeI 
and XhoI and ligated into the pETduet-SpEH at the NdeI/
XhoI sites to form the recombinant pETduet-SpEH-PAL 
(known as DEA). In addition, the recombinant plasmid 
pETduet-SpEH-PAL was transformed into the competent 
E. coli T7 to form E. coli (pETduet-SpEH-PAL) which was 
named E. coli (DEA).
Moreover, the following recombinants were 
constructed in a similar way: E. coli (pCDFduet-
PAL-SMO) (designated as E. coli (CAS)), E. coli (pRS -
Fduet-SpEH-GoSCR) (named as E. coli (REG)), E. coli  
(pCDFduet-GoSCR-SMO) (known as E. coli (CGS)), 
E. coli (pETduet-SpEH-SMO) (designated as E. coli  
(DES)), and E. coli (pRSFduet-GoSCR-PAL) (named 
as E. coli (RGA)). The enzyme GoSCR referred to 
 NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.
Regarding the recombinant E. coli (PAL-Fdc1-Pad1-
SMO-SpEH-GoSCR), the constructed recombinant 
plasmids pRSFduet-Fdc1-Pad1, pETduet-SpEH-PAL, 
and pCDFduet-GoSCR-SMO had different antibiotic 
resistance genes. These recombinants were simulta -
neously transformed into the competent E. coli T7 to 
form the recombinant E. coli (PAL-Fdc1-Pad1-SMO-
SpEH-GoSCR) cells, which were designated as E. coli  
(RFP-DEA-CGS). Furthermore, the recombinant E. coli  
(DFP-CAS-REG) and E. coli (CFP-DES-RGA) cells were 
similarly constructed with different recombinant plas -
mid combinations. These recombinants co-expressed 
PAL, Fdc1, Pad1, SMO, SpEH, and GoSCR.
For E. coli (pETduet-GDH-AlaDH), the GDH and 
AlaDH genes were amplified by PCR using the prim -
ers shown in Additional file  1: Table S1. After, the GDH 
(glucose dehydrogenase) gene was double-digested 
with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pETduet-1 
at the BamHI/HindIII sites to form the recombinant 
pETduet-GDH. Then, the AlaDH gene was double-
digested with the restriction endonucleases KpnI and 
XhoI and further ligated into the pETduet-GDH at the 
KpnI/XhoI sites to obtain a new recombinant plasmid 
pETduet-GDH-AlaDH (known as DGA). This recombi -
nant plasmid was then transformed into the competent 
E. coli T7 to form the recombinant E. coli (pETduet-
GDH-AlaDH), designated as E. coli (DGA).
For E. coli (BMTA-GDH-AlaDH), the constructed 
recombinant plasmids pET28a-BMTA and pETduet-
GDH-AlaDH were simultaneously transformed into 
the competent E. coli T7 to form the recombinant E. 
coli (BMTA-GDH-AlaDH), designated as E. coli (EB-
DGA). These two recombinant plasmids had different 
antibiotic resistance genes. Similarly, the recombinant 
plasmids pET28a-BMTA, pETduet-GDH, and pCDF -
duet-AlaDH were simultaneously transformed into the 
competent E. coli T7 to form the recombinant E. coli  
(BMTA-GDH-AlaDH), named E. coli (EB-DG-CA). The 
enzyme BMTA refers to (S )-selective ω-transaminase.
The expression of all genes from the above-con -
structed recombinant E. coli strains was confirmed by 
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electro -
phoresis (SDS-PAGE) and testing the activity of corre -
sponding enzymes.

Assay methods
For GC analysis of styrene 3, (S)-1-phenyl-1, 2-ethanediol 
5 and 2-HAP 6, the reaction samples (300 µL) were satu -
rated with sodium chloride, mixed with 300 µL of EtOAc 
containing 20  mM of n-dodecane (internal standard), 
after centrifugation (12,000  rpm) at 4  °C for 5  min, the 
organic phase was separated and dried over anhydrous 
 Na2SO4. The concentration of styrene, (S)-1-phenyl-1, 
2-ethanediol and 2-HAP was determined by GC analysis. 
For GC analysis of phenylglycinol 7, the reaction sam -
ples (300 µL) were basified (pH > 10) by adding NaOH 
(10  N), saturated with sodium chloride, and extracted 
with EtOAc (300 µL) containing 20  mM of n-dodecane 
(internal standard). The organic phase was dried over 
anhydrous  Na2SO4, the concentration of the phenylgly -
cinol 7 was determined by GC analysis. GC analysis was 
conducted using Shimadzu GC-14C gas chromatography 
system with a flame ionization detector. The column was 
an Agilent HP-5 (30  m × 0.32  mm × 0.25  mm). Param-
eter: injector temperature, 250 °C; detector temperature, 
275  °C; column temperature: 120  °C. The enantiomeric

et al. 2020).
Results and discussion
Design and in vitro construction of the artificial 
biocatalytic cascade for conversion of L‑PA 1 into chiral 
phenylglycinol 7
A sequential cascade biocatalysis was designed by ret -
rosynthetic strategy to convert bio-based L-PA 1 into 
chiral phenylglycinol 7 (Scheme  1). First, L-PA 1 was 
deaminized to trans-cinnamic acid 2 by the PAL enzyme, 
followed by oxidative decarboxylation of trans -cinnamic 
acid 2 to styrene 3 by PAD. Moreover, the styrene 3 com-
pound was subsequently oxidized to styrene oxide 4 by 
SMO, and styrene oxide 4 was then hydrolyzed to 1-phe -
nyl-1,2-ethanediol 5 by EH. This 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol 
5 compound was oxidized to 2-HAP 6 by ADH. Finally, 
an asymmetric reduction amination converted the 
2-HAP 6 to chiral phenylglycinol 7 by an ω-transaminase 
(ωTA).
Moreover, PAL from Arabidopsis thaliana (Cochrane 
et al. 2004), which plays an important role in the process 
of ammonia removal, was selected for converting L-PA 1 
into trans-cinnamic acid 2 for in vitro reconstruction of 
the biocatalysis cascade. In the second decarboxylation 
step, Fdc1 and Pad1 from Aspergillus niger were selected 
for conversion of trans -cinnamic acid 2 into styrene 3. 
In fact, both enzymes can work together more efficiently 
in the decarboxylation process of the former compound 
(Payne et al. 2015). In the third step, the NADH-depend -
ent SMO from Pseudomonas sp. VLB120 was used for 
converting styrene 3 into (S)-styrene epoxide 4 (Xu et al. 
2009). Furthermore, in the fourth step, SpEH from Sphin-
gomonas sp.HXN-200 was used for selective hydrolysis of 
4 to ( S)-diol 5 (Wu et  al. 2013). After, in the fifth step, 
the GoSCR enzyme from Gluconobacter oxydans 621H 
(Cui et al. 2017) was selected for oxidation of (S)-diol 5 
into 2-HAP 6. In the final amination step, an (R)-selec -
tive ω-transaminase (MVTA) from Mycobacterium van -
baalenii (Zhang et al. 2019) and the BMTA enzyme from 
Bacillus megaterium SC6394 (Zhang et  al. 2020) were 
then employed to convert 2-HAP 6 to ( S)-7 and (R)-7, 
respectively. The  NAD+ and NADH recycling system was 
generated in the third and fifth step of the catalytic pro -
cess. All the enzymes used in this study were lyophilized 
cell-free extracts.
In addition, the activities of these lyophilized enzymes 
were tested considering their corresponding substrates 
(Additional file 1: Table S3). After, the L-PA (10–20 mM) 
and NADH (0.5  mM) compounds were added into the 
reaction system including a set of six different enzymes 
(PAL, Fdc1, Pad1, SMO, SpEH, and GoSCR). Interest -
ingly, 2-HAP 6 was obtained with a 99% conversion per -
centage from 10–20  mM L-PA without optimizing the 
reaction conditions (Table  1). In addition, the (R)-7 and 
(S)-7 compounds were obtained with an ee value of > 99% 
and between a range of conversion percentages from 66.8 
to 87.2% from 10 to 20  mM L-PA with the mixture of 
seven enzymes (PAL, Fdc1, Pad1, SMO, SpEH, GoSCR, 
and MVTA or BMTA) (Table  1). These results showed 
that the designed cascade biocatalysis complex was suc -
cessfully in  vitro constructed for conversion of L-PA 1 
into chiral 7. However, the in  vitro cascade reactions 
needed the application of multiple enzymes. In addition, 
Page 8 of 16Zhang et al. Bioresour. Bioprocess.            (2021) 8:97 
the cell-free enzymes were easily affected by a rapid deac-
tivation, and the redox reaction required an expensive 
cofactor  (NAD+/NADH), which can increase the reac -
tion costs. Consequently, it was decided to construct 
the recombinant E. coli whole cells that were able to co-
express the necessary enzymes for conversion of L-PA 1 
into chiral phenylglycinol 7.
Construction of the recombinant E. coli cell modules 
for conversion of L‑PA into 2‑HAP
Co-expression of multi-enzymes in one microbial cell 
will usually result in serious protein expression burden 
and redox constraints, but these negative factors can be 
reduced by distributing the biocatalytic pathway among 
different cell modules (Wang et  al. 2020). Therefore, a 
synthetic microbial consortium was designed and con -
structed to convert L-PA 1 into chiral phenylglycinol 
7. This microbial consortium included two different 
recombinant E. coli cell modules (Scheme  1). Therefore, 
one recombinant E. coli cell module co-expressed the 
PAL/Fdc1/Pad1/SMO/EH/GoSCR enzymatic set for 
converting L-PA 1 into 2-HAP 6. The second recombi -
nant E. coli cell module expressed the MVTA enzyme 
or co-expressed the BMTA/AlaDH/GDH enzymes set 
for converting 2-HAP into (S)- or (R)-phenylglycinol 7, 
respectively.
Additionally, a recombinant E. coli cells module 1 that 
co-expressed six enzymes (PAL, Fdc1, Pad1, SMO, SpEH, 
and GoSCR) was constructed for converting L-PA 1 into 
2-HAP 6. Also, three expression plasmids (pETDuet-1, 
pRSFDuet-1, and pCDFDuet-1) were used for co-expres -
sion purposes of two different enzymes with various 
combinations (Additional file  1: Figure S1–S3). Theoreti-
cally, there are 15 different plasmid combinations, eight 
of them were randomly selected and constructed to 
co-express six enzymes. Specifically, three recombi -
nant E. coli cells, E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS), E. coli (DFP-
CAS-REG), E. coli (CFP-DES-RGA) with three different 
plasmids combinations were successfully constructed 
(Fig.  1A). Furthermore, a SDS-PAGE analysis of the 
crude lysate present in the constructed recombinant E. 
coli cells showed that the six enzymes were successfully 
expressed in the E. coli cells (Fig.  1B). The performances 
of the constructed recombinant E. coli cells in the con -
version of L-PA 1 into 2-HAP 6 were tested using 10 mM 
L-PA. The results showed that the recombinant E. coli 
(RFP-DEA-CGS) cells had the highest activity (5.6 U/g 
cdw) with the amino acid L-PA 1. By using the recom -
binant E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) cells, the conversion per -
centage of 2-HAP 6 raised to 93% within a 7-h period 
(Fig.  1C). Then, a recombinant E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) 
was selected as the best candidate to convert L-PA 1 
into 2-HAP 6. The cell growth and specific activity of the 
recombinant E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) were further ana -
lyzed (Fig.  1D). Moreover, the highest activity value of E. 
coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) was 5.8 U/g cdw at  OD600 (3.0) after 
a 14-h induction period.
Conversion of L‑PA 1 into 2‑HAP 6 by E. coli (RFP‑DEA‑CGS)
After the recombinant E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) was 
selected for converting L-PA into 2-HAP , the reaction 
conditions were optimized with 20 mM L-PA. The high -
est conversion percentage of 2-HAP was 92% at pH 7.5 
and 25 °C (Fig.  2A-B). Moreover, the addition of 10 mM 
glucose increased the conversion percentage of 2-HAP 6 
to 95% (Fig.  2C). For 10  mM L-PA 1, 15  g cdw/L of E. 
coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) was enough to convert L-PA 1 into 
2-HAP 6 with a 99% conversion percentage. However, 
25  g cdw/L of E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) was needed for 
conversion of 20 mM L-PA 1 into 2-HAP 6. In the case

of 30 mM L-PA, the conversion percentage of 2-HAP 6 
was 91.6% using 25 g cdw/L of E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS). 
However, the conversion of 2-HAP 6 for 50  mM L-PA 
decreased to 46.2% using 25  g cdw/L of E. coli (RFP-
DEA-CGS) (Fig.  2D and Additional file  1: Figure S4). In 
fact, the 2-HAP 6 compound is a very important struc -
tural moiety in several synthetic intermediates used in 
organic and medicinal chemistry. For example, 2-HAP 
can be used as a building block in the synthesis of oxa -
zolone carboxamides, which belong to a novel class of 
acid ceramidase inhibitors. Also, 2-HAP can act as a 
useful pharmacological tool in treating sphingolipid-
mediated disorders (Caputo et al. 2020) and as a potent 
inhibitor of urease (Tanaka et al. 2004).
Construction of recombinant E. coli cell modules 
for conversion of 2‑HAP into chiral phenylglycinol
The MVTA enzyme was selected to catalyze the asym -
metric amination of 2-HAP 6 into (S)-7, and R-MBA 
was used as an optimum amine donor in the conver -
sion process to acetophenone (AP) (Zhang et al. 2019a). 
Therefore, the recombinant E. coli (MVTA) was then 
constructed for conversion of 2-HAP 6 into (S)-phenyl -
glycinol 7. In this case, the whole-cell specific activity of 
the recombinant E. coli (MVTA) cells with 2-HAP 6 was 
22.2 U/g cdw. Regarding the bioconversion of 2-HAP 6 
into (R)-7, BMTA was used for catalyzing the amination 
of the 2-HAP 6 into (R)-7. In addition, L-Ala serves as an 
optimum amine donor that can lead to pyruvate. Thus, 
pyruvate can then be recycled to alanine by employ -
ing the AlaDH enzyme, which consumes ammonia and 
NADH. Also, NADH can be recycled using GDH. Conse-
quently, some recombinant E. coli cells were constructed 
to co-express BMTA, AlaDH, and GDH (Fig.  3A). In 
fact, an SDS-PAGE showed that all the enzymes were 
successfully expressed (Fig.  3B), and the activities of the 
recombinant E. coli cells were tested with 10 mM 2-HAP 
6. Therefore, the recombinant E. coli (EB-DGA) cells 
showed a highest activity of 8.3 U/g cdw with 2-HAP 6 
and a 95% conversion percentage of (R)-7 during a 12-h 
reaction period (Fig. 3C).
Conversion of L‑PA 1 into (S)‑7 by the designed E. coli 
(RFP‑DEA‑CGS) and the E. coli (MVTA) consortium
After the biocatalytic modules were constructed, 
the lyophilized E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and E. coli  
(MVTA) cells were combined to convert L-PA 1  into 
(S)-7. The reaction conditions were first optimized with 
20  mM of L-PA 1 . The results showed that the high -
est conversion percentage of (S )-7 (78%) was obtained 
at a pH of 7.5 and 25 °C. In this case, 10 mM glucose 
and 30  mM R-MBA were used as substrates, and E.

coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and E. coli (MVTA) were com -
bined at a 1:1 ratio with 15  g cdw/L of each recombi -
nant (Fig.  4A–E). Moreover, the combination of two 
recombinant E. coli cells at a 2:1.5 ratio (20  g cdw/L 
of E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and 15  g cdw/L of E. coli  
(MVTA)) resulted in the highest conversion of (S )-
7 (80%) and > 99% ee. Following the above optimized 
reaction conditions, different L-PA 1 concentrations 
(10–50  mM) were tested in a period of 7  h (Fig.  4F), 
and about 98% of conversion of (S )-7 was obtained 
with 10 mM L-PA 1 . Moreover, (S )-7 was obtained with 
only a 34.4% conversion percentage for 30 mM L-PA 1 . 
Surprisingly, a further increase in the substrate concen -
tration to 50 mM decreased the conversion percentage 
of (S )-7 to 12.9%. In fact, the remaining intermediate 
product was mainly diol 5  (85%), and almost no 2-HAP 
6 was detected in the reaction mixture. This finding 
implied that the reactivity of GoSCR with respect to 
the diol intermediate compound in this cascade bioca -
talysis system could be severely inhibited by R-MBA. 
Therefore, the effect of different concentrations of 
R-MBA (0–60 mM) on the conversion of 2-HAP 6  by E. 
coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) was examined with 20 mM L-PA 
1. The results showed that the conversion of 2-HAP 6

was significantly decreased with the increasing concen -
tration of R-MBA (Additional file 1 : Figure S5).
The time course in the bioconversion of 10–30  mM 
L-PA 1 into (S)-7 is shown in Fig.  5. In fact, (S)-7 could 
be obtained with 99% and 84% conversion percentages 
(> 99% ee) from 10 and 20 mM L-PA at 12 h, respectively 
(Additional file  1: Figures S6 and S8). For 30 mM L-PA, 
the highest conversion percentage of (S)-7 was only 35% 
(Fig.  5A). Furthermore, the analysis of the intermedi -
ate products produced from L-PA (20 mM) showed that 
the (S)-7 (35%), diol 5 (35%), styrene 3 (8%), and 2-HAP 
6 (5%) were the main remaining products in the reac -
tion system at 1 h. This finding implied that 83% of L-PA 
1 was converted to styrene 3 due to the high activity of 
PAL, Fdc1, and Pad1. After 1 h, the concentration of diol 
5 began to decrease, while the concentration of (S)-7 
increased linearly. At 7 h, a trace amount of diol 5 (< 1%) 
and 2-HAP 6 (< 1%) were detected in the reaction mix -
ture, and the conversion of (S)-7 reached 75%. Finally, the 
conversion of (S)-7 was continually increased to 84% at 
12 h (Fig. 5B).
Conversion of L‑PA 1 into (R)‑7 by the designed E. coli 
(RFP‑DEA‑CGS) and the E. coli (EB‑DGA) consortium
The lyophilized E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and E. coli (EB-
DGA) cells were combined to create another E. coli 
microbial consortium for conversion purposes from 
L-PA 1 to (R)-7. The reaction conditions were optimized 
with 20 mM of L-PA 1. Figure 6A–F shows that the com-
bination of E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and E. coli (EB-DGA) 
at a 1.5:2 ratio (15 g cdw/L of E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS) and 
20 g cdw/L of E. coli (EB-DGA) led to the highest conver-
sion percentage of (R)-7 (85%) at pH 7.5 and 25 °C with 
20 mM glucose and 400 mM L-Ala. In addition, a reac -
tion mixture with 150 mM  NH3/NH4Cl (regeneration of 
L-Ala by AlaDH) resulted in a 95% conversion percentage 
of (R)-7. Further attempts to decrease the usage of L-Ala 
showed that the (R)-7 yield was not evidently improved 
(< 85%) when the L-Ala concentration was below 
400  mM (data not shown). In fact, Koszelewski et  al. 
(2010) reported that although only a catalytic amount of 
alanine is technically required in the L-Ala regeneration 
system, the non-favored reaction equilibrium of the ami -
nation step can delay the reaction. However, the excess 
of alanine allows a reasonable overall reaction rate. The 
time course for the conversion of 10–30 mM L-PA 1 into 
(R)-7 is shown in Fig.  7. In fact, (R)-7 was obtained with 
conversion percentages of 99% and 95% (> 99% ee) from 
10 and 20  mM L-PA 1 at 12  h, respectively (Additional 
file 1: Figures S7–S8). However, (R)-7 was obtained with 
a 72.8% conversion percentage and ee  values higher than 
99% using a 30-mM L-PA substrate after a 16-h reaction 
period (Fig. 7A). Specifically, an analysis of the intermedi-
ate products from the L-PA 1 (20 mM) reaction showed 
that 2-HAP 6 (38.6%), (R)-7 (26.2%), diol 5 (10.0%), and 
styrene 3 (7%) were the main products obtained after 1 h. 
Therefore, L-PA 1 (> 84%) was converted into styrene 3 
due to the high activity of PAL, Fdc1, and Pad1. In fact, 
this event is consistent with the conversion reaction of 
L-PA 1 into (S)-7. However, 2-HAP 6 (38.6%) and diol 5 
(10.0%) remained in this reaction system, which implies 
that most of the diol 5 compound was converted into 
2-HAP 6. Also, the activity of GoSCR was not affected in 
this system. After a 1-h reaction period, the concentra -
tion of 2-HAP began to decrease, while the concentration 
of (S)-7 increased linearly. In fact, (R)-7 was produced 
in about a 95% conversion percentage and > 99% ee  at 
12 h. Moreover, a trace of 2-HAP 6 (1.5%) was detected 
in the system, and the diol 5 and styrene 3 could not be 
detected at this reaction time (Fig. 7B).

Preparation of (S)‑7 and (R)‑7 from L‑PA
To examine the scalability of this cascade biocatalysis, pre-
parative experiments were conducted on a 100-mL scale 
via the constructed recombinant E. coli microbial consor-
tium. After the reactions were completed (12 h), the reac-
tion solution was extracted with ethyl acetate and flash 
chromatography, pure (S)-7 and (R)-7 were prepared with 
71.0% and 80.5% isolated yields, > 99% ee, and 5.19  g/L.d 
and 4.42  g/L.d volumetric productivity, respectively 
(Table 2, Additional file 1: Figures S9-S10).
Conclusions
In general, an artificial biocatalytic cascade was success -
fully constructed in this study by using a recombinant 
E. coli microbial consortium for converting bio-based 
l-phenylalanine into chiral phenylglycinol. Seven kinds 
of enzymes (PAL, Pad1, Fdc1, SMO, SpEH, GoSCR, and 
MVTA or BMTA) were first examined for the in  vitro 
conversion of these two compounds. Both (R)-phenylgly -
cinol and (S)-phenylglycinol were obtained within a con -
version percentage range of 66.8–87.2% (> 99% ee ) from

10–20 mM l-phenylalanine. Additionally, a recombinant 
E. coli microbial consortium, that included two recombi -
nant E. coli cell modules, was constructed for the efficient 
conversion of l-phenylalanine into chiral phenylgly -
cinol (up to 99% and > 99% ee ). Moreover, the synthetic 
potential of this cascade biocatalysis was further con -
firmed by the constructed recombinant E. coli microbial 
consortium [E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS), E. coli (MVTA) or 
E. coli (RFP-DEA-CGS), E. coli (EB-DGA)]. In this case, 
(S)-phenylglycinol and (R)-phenylglycinol were obtained 
with good yields (71.0% and 80.5%, respectively) and ee  
values higher than 99%. Finally, the advantages of this 
method are its mild reaction conditions, good yields and 
excellent ee values, and not requiring additional cofac -
tors. Therefore, this system can enhance the sustain -
able synthesis of (S)-phenylglycinol or (R)-phenylglycinol 
from bio-based L-phenylalanine.
