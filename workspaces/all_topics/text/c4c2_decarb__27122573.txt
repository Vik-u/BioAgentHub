Abstract
Plants operating C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways exhibit differences in leaf anatomy and photosynthetic carbon 
fixation biochemistry. Fully understanding this underpinning biochemical variation is requisite to identifying solutions 
for improving photosynthetic efficiency and growth. Here we refine assay methods for accurately measuring the car-
boxylase and decarboxylase activities in C 3 and C 4 plant soluble protein. We show that differences in plant extract 
preparation and assay conditions are required to measure NADP-malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy -
lase (pH 8, Mg 2+, 22 °C) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pH 7, >2  mM Mn2+, no Mg 2+) maximal activities 
accurately. We validate how the omission of MgCl2 during leaf protein extraction, lengthy (>1 min) centrifugation times, 
and the use of non-pure ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) significantly underestimate Rubisco activation status. We 
show how Rubisco activation status varies with leaf ontogeny and is generally lower in mature C 4 monocot leaves 
(45–60% activation) relative to C 3 monocots (55–90% activation). Consistent with their >3-fold lower Rubisco con -
tents, full Rubisco activation in soluble protein from C 4 leaves (<5 min) was faster than in C3 plant samples (<10 min), 
with addition of Rubisco activase not required for full activation. We conclude that Rubisco inactivation in illuminated 
leaves primarily stems from RuBP binding to non-carbamylated enzyme, a state readily reversible by dilution during 
cellular protein extraction.
Key words: Carbamylation, carbon fixation, CO2-concentrating mechanism, photosynthesis, Rubisco, Rubisco activase.
Introduction
Plants operating the C 3 and C 4 pathways contain differ -
ing biochemical and anatomical features that facilitate their 
climatic adaptation to cool-temperate and warm-tropical 
environments, respectively (Edwards et al., 2010). The rate-
limiting CO 2 fixation step common to both pathways is 
catalysed by the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphos-
phate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39). 
Fixation of CO2 to RuBP by Rubisco produces two molecules 
of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) that are cycled through the 
photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle to produce tri-
ose-phosphates, the building blocks of carbohydrates needed 
for plant growth (Raines, 2003).
Rubisco is an imperfect catalyst that is remarkably slow 
(completing only 2–4 cycles s –1 in leaves) and can fix O 2

instead of CO 2, with oxygenation of RuBP leading to the 
production of 2-phosphoglycolate (PGly) whose recycling 
back to PGA by the photorespiratory pathway spans three 
cellular compartments and undesirably consumes energy 
and releases fixed CO 2 ( Bauwe et al. , 2010 ). Overcoming 
the catalytic limitations of Rubisco by directed changes 
to the enzyme or concentrating CO 2 around Rubisco to  
reduce the costs of photorespiration are ongoing bioengineer-
ing challenges (Parry et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013; Long et al., 
2015). Current efforts to generate or discover plant Rubisco 
isoforms with joint improvements in specificity for CO 2 as 
opposed to O 2 (S c/o) and carboxylation efficiency (defined 
as the maximum carboxylation rate ( kcat
c) divided by the Km 
for CO2 under ambient O2; KC
21%O2) have yet to yield success 
(Sharwood and Whitney, 2014), despite such Rubiscos exist-
ing in some non-green algae (Andrews and Whitney, 2003).
The evolution of C 4 photosynthesis ~35–40 million years 
ago provided a natural solution to remedy the inefficiency 
of Rubisco (Sage et al., 2012). The anatomical separation of 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in mesophyll cells 
(MCs) and Rubisco in the bundle sheath cell (BSC) chloro -
plasts was accompanied by adaptation of biochemical CO 2-
concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) (Hatch, 1987; Kanai and 
Edwards, 1999). The C 4 pathway involves the hydration by 
carbonic anhydrase of CO2 to HCO3
− which is combined with 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by phosphoenolpyruvate car -
boxylase (PEPC) into the 4C acid oxaloacetate (OAA) that 
is converted into malate or aspartate before diffusing into the 
BSCs where they are decarboxylated, raising the CO2 around 
Rubisco >4-fold higher than ambient CO 2 (von Caemmerer, 
2000; Sage, 2004). The 3C decarboxylation product, pyruvate, 
returns to the MCs for PEP regeneration by pyruvate phos -
phate dikinase (PPDK) at the cost of two ATP equivalents.
The ratio of the activity between the main carboxylases is a 
key determinant of the efficiency of the CCM and can be an 
indication of the CO2 supply to BSCs (von Caemmerer et al., 
2014). On the one hand, PEPC activity is much higher than 
that of Rubisco (2- to 10-fold depending on plant species 
and environmental conditions) to enable the C4 acid gradient 
to build and facilitate the diffusion of the C 4 acids into the 
BSCs. On the other hand, the PEPC:Rubisco ratio must be 
optimized to minimize CO 2 leakage from the BSCs, leading 
to futile cycling involving the CCM ( Kromdijk et al., 2008). 
Futile cycling of the CCM is energetically wasteful for the 
plant through use of ATP to regenerate PEP .
Based on the main decarboxyating enzymes, C4 plants can 
be grouped into three biochemical subtypes: NADP-malic 
enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), 
and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) ( Hatch, 
1987; Kanai and Edwards, 1999 ). In addition, there is flex -
ibility among some NADP-ME (e.g maize, sorghum, and 
Panicum antidotale) and NAD-ME (e.g. Cleome angustifolia, 
Bienertia sinuspersici, and Panicum coloratum) species which 
also harbour PEPCK ( Furbank, 2011 ; Pinto et  al., 2014 ; 
Koteyeva et  al., 2015 ). The significance of the dual decar -
boxylation pathways is not yet fully understood, but evidence 
suggests that PEPCK allows flexibility to the decarboxyla -
tion pathway(s) that may be dependent on environmental 
cues ( Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014 ; Sharwood et  al., 2014 ). 
Assaying for PEPCK is often difficult because pure enzyme 
is required for assaying in the decarboxylase direction due to 
interference from other C 4 pathway enzymes ( Ashton et al., 
1990). However, assaying for PEPCK activity in the carboxy-
lase direction is also troublesome as PEPC can interfere with 
this assay, although variations in PEPCK activities can be 
corroborated by western blot analysis of PEPCK content 
(Sharwood et al., 2014). Accurately determining the level of 
maximum PEPCK activity is requisite to determine the level 
of flexibility in the decarboxylation pathways that may exist.
A conserved feature of Rubisco catalysis is the required 
priming (activation) of each catalytic site (E) located at the 
interface of adjoining paired 50  kDa large subunits (L2) that 
arrange as (L2)4 tetrad cores and are capped at either end with 
tetrads of 15  kDa small (S) subunits to form an ~520  kDa 
L8S8 complex ( Andersson and Backlund, 2008 ). Activation 
proceeds via the slow and reversible binding of non-sub -
strate CO2 to the ε-amino group of a conserved L-subunit 
Lys201 producing a carbamate (EC) that is rapidly stabilized 
by Mg 2+ to produce a tertiary complex (ECM) capable of 
RuBP binding and enolization and its subsequent carboxyla-
tion or oxygenation ( Andersson, 2008). In vivo, the pool of 
inactive Rubisco comprises decarbamylated catalytic sites 
(E) and ECM complexes binding inhibitory sugar-phosphate 
molecules (ECMI) (Parry et al., 2008) (Fig. 1). Examples of 
these inhibitors include the catalytic misfire product xylu -
lose 1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP) and the ‘nocturnal’ or ‘shade’ 
inhibitor 2'-carboxy- d-arabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) pro -
duced under low light and darkness ( Gutteridge et al., 1986; 
Moore and Seemann, 1992 ; Pearce, 2006; Andralojc et  al., 
2012). Binding of RuBP to E also leads to the production 
of catalytically stalled ER complexes ( Laing and Christeller, 
1976; Jordan and Chollet, 1983 ). Release of these sugar-
phosphate molecules is catalysed by Rubisco activase (RCA) 
via ATP hydrolysis (Parry et al., 2008; Mueller-Cajar et al., 
2014). Following their RCA-facilitated release, the rebinding 
of XuBP and CA1P is prevented by the enzymes XuBPase 
(Bracher et al., 2015) and CA1Pase (Salvucci and Holbrook, 
1989; Moore and Seemann, 1992 ). The enzyme CA1Pase is

also able to metabolize the inhibitor pentadiulose-1,5-bispho-
sphate (PDBP; Andralojc et al., 2012), a relatively labile oxy-
genation byproduct whose inhibitory relevance in vivo remains 
indeterminate but is a significant contaminant of non-pure 
RuBP (Kane et al., 1998). Conditions that stimulate Rubisco 
inactivation include increasing temperature (increased XuBP 
and PDBP production), low illumination (stimulated CA1P 
synthesis), and elevated CO 2 (possibly increases ER levels) 
(Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 2000 ; Salvucci and Crafts-
Brandner, 2004; Kim and Portis, 2005; Parry et al., 2008).
Extrapolating aspects of cellular biochemistry from leaf 
gas exchange measurements using available C 3 and C 4 pho-
tosynthesis models is highly reliant on accurately knowing 
the content and catalytic properties of the carboxylation and 
decarboxylation enzyme activities ( Farquhar et  al., 1980 ; 
Salvucci and Crafts-Brandner, 2004 ; Sharkey et  al., 2007 ). 
Here we appraise and refine the methods for assaying PEPC, 
PEPCK, and Rubisco activity and activation status using 
NADH-linked spectrometric assays. We apply these refined 
assay methods to leaf extracts from C3 and C4 grasses to dem-
onstrate their applicability in accurately measuring variations 
in the carboxylation/decarboxylation biochemistries of leaves 
of differing ontogeny.
Materials and methods
Plant seeds and growth conditions
Seeds for Panicum bisulcatum  and Megathyrsus maximum  were 
obtained from the Australian Plant Genetic Resources Information 
System (QLD, Australia) and Queensland Agricultural Seeds Pty. 
Ltd (Toowoomba, Australia), while the seeds for tobacco (Nicotiana 
tabacum, cv Petit havana), maize ( Zea mays  cv Kelvedon Glory), 
and wheat ( Triticum aestivum  cv Y70) were sourced locally. The 
seeds were sown in 2–5 litre pots of commercial self-fertilizing 
potting mix at 5–7 d intervals to obtain plants of different ages to 
sample simultaneously. The plants were grown in a glasshouse at 
set 28/22 oC day/night temperatures under natural illumination dur-
ing November and December in Canberra, Australia. Plants were 
watered regularly, with the addition of Hoaglands nutrients to 
mature plants every 2 d.
Leaf harvesting, protein extraction, and protein assay
Samples of known area (0.3 or 0.5  cm2) were harvested using brass 
cork borers (Met-App Metalware, Melbourne) from different aged 
leaves on the same day, 5–7  h into the light period. The samples 
were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at –80 °C. 
For assays of Rubisco activity and content as well as the activity 
of PEPC and NADP-ME, the soluble leaf protein was extracted 
using ice-cold 2  ml glass homogenizers (Wheaton) into 0.5–1  ml of 
ice cold, N 2-sparged extraction buffer [50  mM EPPS-NaOH, pH 
8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2  mM DTT, 1% (v/v) plant protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone 
(PVPP)] containing 0, 2, 5, or 10 mM MgCl2. The lysate was rapidly 
centrifuged for 0.5, 2, or 5  min (16 000 g, 4 °C), and 10 µl of the 
soluble leaf protein was assayed for initial and total Rubisco activi-
ties (see below) and 50 µl to measure Rubisco content by [14C]CABP 
(2-C-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) binding as described 
(Whitney et al., 2001). Protein content was measured against BSA 
standards using a Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce). The leaf 
area extracted in 1 ml of buffer was generally 0.3  cm2 (T. aestivum), 
0.5 cm2 (N. tabacum), 0.6 cm2 (P . bisulcatum), and 0.9 cm2 (P . bisulca-
tum, M. maximus, and Z. mays)
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase assay
Maximal PEPC activities were measured using an NADH-coupled 
assay as previously described ( Ashton et al., 1990). Extraction was 
performed using the same extraction buffer as described for Rubisco 
containing 5 mM MgCl2, and samples were incubated at room tem-
perature or on ice for 0, 5, 10, and 20  min before adding 10  µl of 
extract to initiate assays.
NADP-malic enzyme assay
Maximal NADP-ME activity was determined in a coupled NADP 
assay as previously described ( Ashton et al., 1990; Pengelly et al., 
2012). Briefly, NADP-ME activity in leaf extracts prepared as 
described above was assayed in 50 mM Tricine-KOH pH 8.3, 5 mM 
malic acid, initiating with 10 mM MgCl2.
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase assay
The maximal activity of PEPCK was measured in the carboxy -
lase direction using a method adapted from Chen et al. (2002) and 
Walker et  al. (2002) as described by Sharwood et  al. (2014) in an 
NADH-coupled assay as depicted in Fig. 2A. To remove interfer -
ence with PEPC, MgCl2 was excluded from the extraction and assay 
buffers. PEPC background activity was determined by assaying for 
PEPC activity as above with and without MgCl 2, with no PEPC 
activity observed when MgCl 2 is omitted from the extraction and 
assay buffer (data not shown). For PEPCK assay, leaf discs were 
extracted in 50  mM HEPES pH 7.0, 5  mM DTT, 1% (w/v) PVPP, 
2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MnCl2, and 0.05% Triton. PEPCK activity from 
leaf extracts was measured in assay buffer [50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 
4% mercaptoethanol (w/v), 100  mM KCl, 90  mM NaHCO 3,1 mM 
ADP, 2 mM MnCl 2, 0.14  mM NADH, and malate dehydrogenase 
(MDH; 6 U; 3.7 μl)] after the addition of 15  mM PEP . An optimal 
PEP concentration was determined in separate assays titrated with 
2.5–20 mM PEP .
Rubisco activity assays
Rubisco activity was measured at 25 °C using an NADH-coupled 
enzyme assay ( Kubien et al., 2011; Supplementary Fig. S1  at JXB 
online) with the rate of NADH oxidation monitored at 340  nm 
using a diode array spectrophotometer (Agilent model 8453). The 
RuBP used in the assays was either that synthesized and purified as 
previously described ( Kane et al., 1998) or commercially supplied 
(Sigma; R0878). Assays were performed in 1  ml cuvettes contain -
ing 0.48 ml of assay buffer [100  mM EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10  mM 
MgCl2, 0.2  mM NADH, 20  mM NaHCO 3, 1  mM ATP, pH 7.0, 
5 mM phosphocreatine, pH 7.0, and 4% (v/v) coupling enzymes] 
(see Supplementary Table S1 ). RuBP (0.4  mM) was included in 
the cuvettes used to measure initial Rubisco activity, with 20 µl of 
soluble leaf protein sample added to start the assays. To measure 
total Rubisco activities, 20 µl of leaf protein was first activated for 
10–15 min in RuBP-free assay buffer before initiating Rubisco activ-
ity measurements by adding RuBP to 0.4 mM. The Rubisco carbox-
ylation rate was determined using the equation:

which uses the extinction coefficient of NADH (6.22 × 103 M−1 cm−1), 
the rate of change of absorbance at 340  nm per minute ( ΔOD340), 
and accounts for the four NADH molecules oxidized per RuBP car-
boxylated by Rubisco in the coupled assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Substrate-saturated Rubisco carboxylase activity in the same leaf 
soluble protein was measured by 14CO2 fixation assays as described 
(Sharwood et  al., 2008 ). The carboxylation turnover rate ( kcat
c) 
was determined from the Rubisco activity measured by either the 
3140 | Sharwood et al.
NADH-coupled enzyme assay or the 14CO2 fixation assay divided 
by the Rubisco active site content in the assay as quantified by [14C]
CABP binding (Ruuska et al., 1998). Time course measurements of 
Rubisco activity over 30  min at 25 °C were undertaken to confirm 
the functional integrity of Rubisco in the leaf protein extracts.
Rubisco activase purification and assay
Tobacco RCA was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli  
as described ( Baker et  al., 2005). Two-stage assays similar to that 
described by Barta et al. (2011) were used to assess if sugar-phos -
phate Rubisco inhibition in tobacco leaf protein extracts influenced 
measurements of total Rubisco activity. In the first assay stage, 50 μl 
of leaf extract was incubated in a 0.5 ml final volume with 80 µg ml–1 
RCA (or BSA in the RCA-free controls) for 2 min at 25 °C in ATPase 
assay buffer [100 mM EPPS, pH 8.0, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 6% 
(w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) (mol. wt 3350  Da)], 2  mM PEP, 
0.2 mM NADH, 2  mM ATP, 1% (v/v) of a pyruvate kinase/lactate 
dehydrogenase mixture (PK, 745 U ml−1; LDH, 906 U ml−1, Sigma-
Aldrich). In the second assay stage, 100 μl of the RCA leaf or BSA 
leaf protein reactions were added to the NADH-linked Rubisco 
assays and the total activities compared. Control assays examining 
tobacco RCA activation of purified tobacco Rubisco ER complexes 
are described in Supplementary Fig. S2.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using one- or two-way ANOV A 
(Statistica, StatSoft Inc. OK, USA). Means were grouped using a 
post-hoc Tukey test.
Results and Discussion
Optimizing the assay of PEPC and PEPCK activities in 
total soluble leaf protein
Measuring PEPC and PEPCK activities separately in solu -
ble leaf protein extracts using NADH-linked spectrophoto -
metric assays is complicated by their common requirement 
for substrate PEP (Fig. 2A) particularly in assays containing 
Mg2+ and Mn 2+ at physiological concentrations ( Muhaidat 
and McKown, 2013). Determining maximal PEPCK activity 
in soluble leaf protein extracts is typically achieved by assay-
ing the decarboxylation reaction of PEPCK, requiring puri -
fied protein free of other C 4 enzymes such as PEPC ( Ashton 
et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2002). In contrast, measures of PEPC 
rates free of PEPCK activity can easily be made by omis -
sion of ADP from the assay ( Fig.  2A). As in vitro measures 
of PEPC are sensitive to low temperature storage (Hatch and 
Oliver, 1978), we examined the PEPC activity in soluble leaf 
protein from Z. mays and M. maximus stored either at room 
temperature (22 °C) or on ice (0 °C) (Fig. 2B). When incubated 
at 22 °C for 20 min, there was little or no loss of PEPC activ-
ity evident in replica leaf samples from either M. maximus or 
Z. mays. In contrast, storage of the leaf protein extracts on ice 
significantly reduced PEPC activities (measured at 25 °C), par-
ticularly in M. maximus where >65% of PEPC activity was lost 
after 5 min at 0 °C (Fig. 2B). As a result of its sensitivity to low 
temperature, all assays of PEPC activity were performed on 
rapidly extracted (homogenized in <0.5  min and centrifuged 
for 0.5 min at 4 oC) leaf soluble protein without storage on ice.
In C 4 plants with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 
(PCK) physiology (e.g. M.  maximus), PEPCK is the domi -
nant decarboxylase enzyme that utilizes ATP hydrolysis 
during its reversible decarboxylation of OAA ( Fig.  2A). In 
contrast to the alkali pH 8 preference of PEPC ( Greenway 
et al., 1978), the activity of PEPCK is optimal at pH 7 and 
80% lower at pH 8.0 ( Ray and Black, 1976 ; Pierre et  al., 
2004). To minimize, possibly preclude, PEPC activity, the 
extraction and measurement of PEPCK carboxylase activ -
ity was undertaken at pH 7.0 with Mg 2+ (required for PEPC 
activity) omitted and replaced with 2  mM Mn2+, a PEPCK 
cofactor ( Fig.  2A). Under these conditions, stable rates of 
PEPCK were obtained in assays initiated by the addition of 
PEP (solid line, Fig. 2C) (Sharwood et al., 2014).

ensure: 1) No MgCl2 in assay and extraction buffers, 2) MnCl2 up to 5mM in

No glucose-6-phosphate, and 5) include aspartate in assay buffer.
Carbon fixation biochemistry in higher plants | 3141
Alternative PEPCK analyses were undertaken where the 
assays were initiated with ADP, not PEP ( Fig.  2C, black 
dashed line). Omission of ADP in control assays produced 
background rates of apparent PEPC activity ( Fig. 2C, lower 
black dashed line); however, the addition of 5  mM aspartate 
(Fig.  2C, grey dashed line) or 5  mM glucose-6-phosphate 
(and MgCl 2) which inhibit and stimulate PEPC activity, 
respectively (Fig. 2A), had a negligible effect on the measured 
activities. This suggests that the background ‘no ADP’ PEP 
carboxylase activities observed arise from PEPCK activity 
that is utilizing residual ADP in the soluble protein extract. 
Consequently, we propose that extracting leaf protein in pH 
7.0 buffer with no MgCl2 and assaying in an MnCl2-containing 
buffer at the same pH is sufficient to measure PEPCK activity 
with little or no contaminating PEPC activity.
Assays containing 2.5–25 mM PEP were used to determine 
that a saturating concentration of 15  mM PEP was required 
for maximal PEPCK activity in soluble leaf protein from 
1.3 mm2 of M. maximus leaf tissue (Fig. 2D). This saturating 
PEP concentration is 7-fold higher than the Km for PEP meas-
ured for M. maximus PEPCK (Chen et al., 2002) and was the 
concentration used in all subsequent PEPCK assays.
Measuring Rubisco carbamylation status
The carboxylase-limiting component of the C3 photosynthesis 
models stemming from those derived by Farquhar et al. (1980) 
are typically used to derive estimates of Vc,max [in units of µmol 
CO2 fixed m−2 s−1, that equate to the product of Rubisco sites 
(µmol CO2 fixed m2) and kcat
c (s−1)]. This measure is extrapo-
lated from the response of the CO2 assimilation rate (A) with 
increasing CO2 measured by leaf gas exchange, and relies heav-
ily on the temperature response measurements of kcat
c, Kc, the 
Km for O2 (Ko), and CO2/O2 specificity (Sc/o) made for tobacco 
Rubisco (Sharkey et al. , 2007 ). The universal suitability of 
these parameters is now in question given the substantial vari-
ation observed in the temperature response of these param -
eters among plant Rubiscos (Walker et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 
2015; Perdomo et al., 2015). Moreover, differences in Vc,max are 
primarily attributed to variations in Rubisco content and gen-
erally overlook differences in the activation status of Rubisco 
in vivo, despite its critical influence on estimates of Vc,max and 
in vivo determined kcat
c (Bernacchi et al., 2001; Salvucci and 
Crafts-Brandner, 2004).
As indicated in Fig. 1, within an illuminated leaf chloroplast 
the catalytic sites of Rubisco (shown as E) are primarily CO2–
Mg2+ activated (ECM) and capable of RuBP catalysis. Binding 
of inhibitory XuBP or, in darkened leaves, CA1P to ECM pro-
duces catalytically inactive ECMI complexes whose activation 
involves RCA-catalysed dissociation of the sugar-phosphate 
ligands which are then degraded by substrate-specific enzymes 
(Jordan and Chollet, 1983; Gutteridge et al., 1986; Edmondson 
et al., 1990; Bracher et al., 2015). Thus the most abundant form 
of Rubisco inhibition in illuminated chloroplasts is probably 
the binding of RuBP to non-carbamylated Rubisco (ER) that 
renders the catalytic site inactive (Jordan and Chollet, 1983).
The NADH-linked spectrophotometric and 14CO2 fixation 
in vitro assays typically used to measure Rubisco activation 
status involve three stages (Fig. 1). The first stage involves the 
rapid measure of Rubisco activity in rapidly extracted solu -
ble leaf protein. This measures the ‘initial’ Rubisco activity. 
Saturating amounts of RuBP are included to prevent ECM 
formation from the ER complexes and ensure that the assays 
are not RuBP limited ( Laing and Christeller, 1976 ). Replica 
samples of the leaf protein extracts are then allowed to acti -
vate fully by incubating in buffer lacking RuBP but contain-
ing saturating CO 2 and Mg 2+. During the second stage, the 
inconsequential RuBP levels in the extract enable its dissocia-
tion from the ER complexes to allow ECM formation. The 
third stage measures the ‘total’ Rubisco activity rate. In sam-
ples from darkened or stressed leaves, the formation of ECMI 
complexes can cause significant underestimation of the ‘total’ 
activities (Parry et al., 1997, 2002; Carmo-Silva et al., 2010) 
a consideration we sought to avoid in this study by sampling 
healthy, naturally illuminated glasshouse-grown plant mate -
rial 6–7 h into the photoperiod.
Optimizing leaf protein extraction for measuring 
Rubisco activation status
Analyses undertaken using tobacco leaves highlighted the 
requirement for speed and inclusion of ~5 mM Mg2+ during leaf 
protein extraction for accurate measurements of initial Rubisco 
activity (Fig.  3A). As shown in Fig.  1, formation of ECM is 
initiated by the slow and reversible carbamylation of Lys201 in 
the catalytic site of E followed by the rapid binding of Mg2+. 
To avoid Rubisco carbamylation occurring during extraction, 
the leaf soluble protein is extracted in N 2-sparged (i.e. CO2-
free) buffer. It was hypothesized that the exclusion of MgCl2 
during extraction would undesirably produce EC complexes 
from which the activating CO2 would dissociate to form inac-
tive E. Indeed, the omission of MgCl2 in the CO2-free extrac-
tion buffer led to significantly lower measurements of initial 
Rubisco activity (70% of maximum activity) after just 0.5 min 
relative to those extracted with 2–10 mM MgCl2 (82–85% of 
maximum activity; Fig. 3A). Extending the extraction (centrifu-
gation) period to 5 min reduced all initial Rubisco activity meas-
urements, more so in those extracted without MgCl2 (35% of 
maximum activity) compared with those extracted with MgCl2 
(55–60% of maximum activity). In all treatments, very similar 
total activity rates were attained, indicating that the varying 
extraction conditions did not compromise Rubisco integrity 
(Fig. 3A, circles). These findings caution against the omission 
of MgCl 2 when assaying for initial activities. Furthermore, 
potential inaccuracies are incurred with extended centrifuga-
tion times of >0.5–1 min following extraction, emphasizing the 
need for rapid leaf protein extraction and assay.
The importance of using purified RuBP
Using pure RuBP devoid of inhibitory impurities such as 
PDBP is critical for accurately measuring Rubisco catalysis  
in vitro (Kane et al., 1998; Andralojc et al., 2012). As observed 
by Scales et al. (2014), by using pure RuBP the measured rates 
of initial and total activity remain relatively linear over a 4 min 
assay period (Fig. 3B). This (i) indicates that insignificant levels 
3142 | Sharwood et al.
of the catalytic misfire products XuBP or PDBP are produced 
over the assay period; (ii) indicates that Rubisco activity in the 
assay is stable; and (iii) confirms the observations of Laing 
and Christeller (1976) that inclusion of saturating RuBP lev -
els (0.2–0.4 mM) in the ‘initial’ assays prevents Rubisco acti -
vation. In contrast, Rubisco activities measured in the same 
extracts using a commercial source of non-pure RuBP (Fig. 3B, 
squares) declined rapidly, presumably due to PDBP contamina-
tion (Andralojc et al., 2012). The use of non-pure RuBP further 
compromised the quantification of kcat
c (2.2 s−1 with pure RuBP 
versus 1.3 s−1 with non-pure RuBP) and the calculated activa-
tion status of Rubisco (75 ± 2% with pure RuBP versus 83 ± 3% 
with non-pure RuBP). Use of non-pure RuBP should therefore 
be avoided in order to avoid underestimating the carbamyla-
tion status ( Rowland-Bamford et  al., 1991 ; Anwaruzzaman 
et al., 1996; Ruuska et al., 2004; Sulpice et al., 2007) and activity 
(Rintamäki et al., 1988; Uemura et al., 2000) of Rubisco.
Insignificant levels of ECMI complexes accumulate in 
illuminated, non-stressed leaves
The kcat
c value of 2.2  s−1 was reproducibly quantified for 
tobacco Rubisco using the NADH-coupled assay. This is 
~30% lower than those typically measured by 14CO2 fixa -
tion assays ( Sharwood et al. , 2008 ; Whitney et al. , 2011 ). 
Incubation of the leaf protein extracts with purified tobacco 
RCA or BSA (control) showed no difference in the measured 
total Rubisco activities ( Fig. 3C). In corresponding control 
assays, the RCA treatment was able to reactivate ER inhibited 
Rubisco fully over 10 min (Supplementary Fig. S2). This indi-
cates that the lower kcat
c was not due to residual ECMI com-
plexes in the leaf protein extract. To confirm this, the same 
tobacco soluble leaf protein was used to quantify kcat
c by the 
14CO2 assay method of Sharwood et al. (2008). As indicated 
in Table 1, the expected kcat
c of 3.1 s−1 for tobacco Rubisco was 
obtained by the 14CO2 assay. This finding questions the accu-
racy of the NADH-coupled assay for quantifying Rubisco 
carboxylase activity, a deficiency also evident in the compara-
tive measurements made by Lilley and Walker (1974). Indeed, 
published kcat
c values determined by the NADH-coupled 
assay for cyanobacteria (Emlyn-Jones et al., 2006) and plant 
(Pearce and Andrews, 2003) Rubisco are also 20–25% lower 
than those measured by 14CO2 fixation (Whitney et al., 1999; 
Mueller-Cajar and Whitney, 2008). To ensure that the differ-
ences were not due to components in the leaf extracts inter -
fering with the coupling enzymes, comparative assays were 
undertaken in triplicate (technical repeats) using tobacco 
Rubisco purified by ion exchange chromatography (see the 
legend to Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Again, the kcat
c values 
determined by the NADH-coupled assay (1.9  ± 0.2 s−1) were 
30% lower than that quantified by 14CO2 fixation assays

(2.7 ± 0.1 s−1). This suggests that substrate limitations for one 
or more of the enzymes in the NADH-linked assay limit its 
potential for accurately quantifying kcat
c, possibly the rate of 
3-PGA reduction (Lilley and Walker, 1974).
The need for measuring Rubisco activation rate and 
stability over time
Given that the NADH-coupled assay allows for the continued 
‘real-time’ monitoring of both initial and total Rubisco activ-
ity (Fig. 3B), it was used to examine the activation rate and 
stability of Rubisco activity at 25 °C in the soluble protein 
of leaves from the C 3 species P . bisulcatum and T. aestivum 
(wheat), and the C4 species M. maximus and Z. mays. Linear 
rates of initial and total Rubisco activities were reproducibly 
found for each sample ( Fig.  4A), with the rates of NADH 
oxidation significantly lower in the C 4 samples due to their 
low Rubisco contents. As shown in Fig. 4A, the kcat
c for both 
C4 Rubiscos were seen to be higher than those of their C 3 
counterparts when the activities were corrected for Rubisco 
content (quantified by [14C]CABP binding).
Like tobacco, full activation of Rubisco in the soluble protein 
extracted from wheat and P . bisulcatum required 10 min incuba-
tion at 25 ºC ( Fig. 4B, circles). In contrast, full activation of 
Rubisco in the M. maximus and Z. mays leaf protein required 
only 3–5 min (Fig. 4B). Whether the faster rate of Rubisco acti-
vation in both C 4 species arises from a lower RuBP binding 
affinity remains a subject for future investigation. Nevertheless, 
variation in the time needed to activate Rubisco fully in leaf 
protein extracts questions whether shorter incubation times 
(e.g. 3 min) are sufficient to evaluate Rubisco activation status 
accurately and extrapolate ECMI levels ( Parry et al. , 1997 , 
2002; Carmo-Silva et al., 2010; Galmes et al., 2011; Scales et 
al., 2014).
The kcat
c of C4 plant Rubisco exceeds that of C3 
Rubisco
The kcat
c values of Rubisco from the C 4 species examined in 
this study were significantly faster relative to that of each C 3 
plant Rubisco (Table 1). Notably the NADH-coupled assay 
measures of kcat
c were again 30–35% lower than correspond-
ing kcat
c measurements made using 14CO2 fixation assays 
(Table 1). Statistical ranking of the catalytic speed indicated

that the C 3 Rubisco from P .  bisulcatum is slower than that 
of tobacco, with wheat outperforming both ( P<0.001). In 
contrast to its ancestral P .  bisulcatum Rubisco, the kcat
c for 
M. maximus Rubisco is ~2-fold higher but similar to the kcat
c 
of maize Rubisco despite originating from different biochem-
ical subtypes and evolutionary origins (Table 1).
How do PEPC, Rubisco content, and activation status 
vary with leaf age?
Rubisco comprises a significant but variable N investment 
in plant leaves. In tobacco, wheat, and rice, Rubisco com -
prises 20–30% of the leaf N, which is equivalent to 30–60% 
of the leaf soluble protein ( Evans, 1989 ; Makino et  al., 
2003; Whitney et  al., 2011 ), while in C 4 plants it is 5–10% 
(Ghannoum et al., 2005). The lower Rubisco requirement of 
C4 plants stems from their CCM that enables them to operate 
under near saturating CO 2 concentration, which has facili -
tated the evolution of increased Rubisco kcat
c ( Ghannoum 
et al., 2005). Consistent with these findings, the variation in 
Rubisco content with leaf ontogeny and at different locations 
in the canopy of M.  maximus and maize ( Fig.  5A) was 3- 
to 25-fold lower than that measured in C 3 species (tobacco, 
P . bisulcatum, and wheat, Fig. 5B). Among the C3 plants, sig-
nificantly higher levels of Rubisco were measured in wheat 
relative to tobacco and P .  bisulcatum, with the latter grass 
showing the greatest variation in Rubisco content (per leaf 
area) in the leaves from juvenile and mature plants.
The variation in Rubisco with leaf ontogeny evident in both 
C4 species was somewhat mirrored by differences in their PEPC 
activities (Fig. 5B), resulting in similar PEPC:Rubisco activity 
ratios of ~3.9–5.7 in M.  maximus that were more varied in 
maize (4.2–7.9 in juvenile plant leaves and 8.5–9.3 in the young 
leaves of exponentially growing plants; Fig. 5C). This ratio is 
typically used as an indication of the CO2 supply to the CCM 
in C4 plants and is normally in balance to minimize leakage 
of fixed CO 2 (von Caemmerer, 2000; von Caemmerer et al., 
2014). In both M. maximus and Z. mays, the PEPC:Rubisco 
ratio tended to increase during ontogeny, in particular when 
the ratio is adjusted with regard to differences in Rubisco acti-
vation status ( Fig.  5C). The higher Rubisco:PEPC ratio in 
mature Z. mays leaves relative to M. maximus may arise from 
their varying C 4 biochemistry and/or evolutionary origin, a 
consideration beyond the objectives of this study.
Despite being produced in lower abundance, the activation 
status of C 4 Rubisco was similar or lower than that meas -
ured in the C3 species. Similarly, low levels of Rubisco activa-
tion (~45–55%) have been measured in other C 4 species (von 
Caemmerer et al., 2005; Carmo-Silva et al., 2010) that corre-
late with those measured in mature M. maximus and Z. mays 
leaves (Fig. 5D). Higher Rubisco activation levels (~70–80%) 
were measured in the juvenile C 4 plant leaves. These levels 
matched those measured in tobacco and P . bisulcatum, where 
little variation in Rubisco activation status was found among 
the leaves sampled. In contrast, significant variation in Rubisco 
activation status was observed among the upper wheat panicle 
leaves, where Rubisco activation was significantly lower than 
those sampled from juvenile plants (Fig. 5D).
The level of variation in Rubisco content and activation 
status with leaf ontogeny identified within this explorative 
study using plants grown under non-stress conditions empha-
sizes the importance of determining these parameters to com-
pare meaningfully values of Vc,max derived by extrapolation 
from leaf gas exchange ( A–Ci curves) for different biological 
samples. As demonstrated by Whitney and Sharwood (2014), 
quantifying the leaf Rubisco content is best achieved using 
the [ 14C]CABP binding methods as densitometry methods 
following PAGE separation of Rubisco are highly imprecise, 
unless appropriately calibrated. Accurate quantification of 
Rubisco site content in the in vitro assays of Rubisco activity 
are also critical for quantifying kcat
c. This parameter also pro-
vides a number of quality checks as reduced measures of kcat
c 
provide a useful indicator of reduced leaf sample viability (as 
found if ultra-cold temperatures are not maintained during 
transfer and storage at –80 °C) and incomplete activation 
(e.g. insufficient activation time and/or presence of significant 
levels of ECMI complexes in the sample).
Variation in NADP-ME and PEPCK activities in Z. mays 
and M. maximus.
Different aged leaves sampled from mature M. maximus and 
Z. mays plants were analysed for maximal NADP-ME and 
PEPCK activities ( Fig. 6 ). Higher PEPCK activities were 
measured in the younger leaves from both species, with as 
much as 2-fold higher activity measured in the Z. mays sam-
ples. Conversely, NADP-ME levels were characteristically 
>10-fold higher in Z. mays, consistent with its C4-NADP-ME 
photosynthetic biochemistry. While the low NADP-ME 
activity in M. maximum probably arose from an anaplerotic 
reaction, the significance of the PEPCK activity in Z. mays is 
not yet fully understood. Prior analysis of Z. mays exposed 
to salinity stress and shade treatments showed that there is 
plasticity in PEPCK contents and activity ( Sharwood et al., 
2014). This suggests that the PEPCK decarboxylation path -
way may serve a role in responding to stressful environmental 
cues (Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014).
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrate the need for carefully consider-
ing the experimental requirements needed to measure accu -
rately, and reproducibly, the activity of key carboxylase and 
decarboxylase enzymes that are commonly used to evaluate 
physiological and biochemical parameters between plant 
samples. Of particular relevance to C3 and C4 photosynthetic 
modelling studies is how Rubisco content and activation 
can vary significantly with leaf ontogeny, in particular in C 4 
plants where Rubisco activation appears characteristically 
low. Here we show that full Rubisco activity is recoverable in 
vitro without the need for RCA when extracted with no RuBP . 
We therefore propose that Rubisco inactivation in the chloro-
plasts of non-stressed, illuminated leaves is primarily attribut-
able to ER complex formation. Removing Rubisco inhibitors 
using Na2SO4 and PEG treatments ( Parry et al., 1997, 2002; 
Carmo-Silva et al., 2010; Galmes et al., 2011; Scales et al., 
Carbon fixation biochemistry in higher plants | 3145
2014) that can potentially harm recoverable activity might 
therefore be unnecessary using the in vitro assay conditions 
described in this study.
As summarized in Supplementary Fig. S3 , we identified 
the core requirements for measuring Rubisco activation sta -
tus (fast extraction, include ~5  mM MgCl2, use pure RuBP, 
activate for 10  min), PEPC (pH 8, 22 °C post-extraction), 
PEPCK (pH 7, >2  mM Mn 2+ no Mg 2+, 15  mM PEP), and 
NADP-ME activities using NADH-linked assays. We high -
light how an unresolved limitation in the NADH linked assay 
underestimates Rubisco kcat
c by >20%. We also emphasize 
the advantage of quantifying Rubisco by [14C]CABP binding

(Whitney et al., 2011), P . bisulcatum (Pinto et al., 2014), M. maximus (Pinto et al., 2016), and maize (Sharwood et al., 2014).

to normalize Rubisco activities per active site (i.e. kcat
c) as 
it serves as a quality control indicator of sample integrity 
and full Rubisco activation. Understandably, the assay and 
extraction conditions used in this study probably need opti -
mization for other plant samples where additives and condi -
tions (pH, temperature) are required to sustain, or promote, 
enzyme activities (Supplementary Fig. S3). As shown here by 
the differing assay requirements of PEPC and PEPCK, this 
optimization should also assess the compatibility of additives 
on the activity of each enzyme measured.
