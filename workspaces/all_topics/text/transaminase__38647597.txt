SHORT REPORT
Regiospecific C–H amination 
of (−)-limonene into (−)-perillamine 
by multi-enzymatic cascade reactions

Abstract 
Background: (−)‑Limonene, one of cyclic monoterpenes, is an important renewable compound used widely as 
a key building block for the synthesis of new biologically active molecules and fine chemicals. (−)‑Perillamine, as 
derived from (−)‑limonene, is a highly useful synthon for constructing more complicated and functionally relevant 
chemicals.
Aim: We aimed to report a more sustainable and more efficient method for the regiospecific C–H amination of 
(−)‑limonene into (−)‑perillamine.
Results: Here, we report an artificial penta‑enzymatic cascade system for the transformation of the cheap and easily 
available (−)‑limonene into (−)‑perillamine for the first time. This system is composed of cytochrome P450 monooxy‑
genase, alcohol dehydrogenase and w‑transaminase for the main reactions, as well as formate dehydrogenase and 
NADH oxidase for cofactor recycling. After optimization of the multi‑enzymatic cascade system, 10 mM (−)‑limonene 
was smoothly converted into 5.4 mM (−)‑perillamine in a one‑pot two‑step biotransformation, indicating the feasibil‑
ity of multi‑enzymatic C7‑regiospecific amination of the inert C–H bond of (−)‑limonene. This method represents a 
concise and efficient route for the biocatalytic synthesis of derivatives from similar natural products.

Introduction
Monoterpenoids exist widely in the secretory tissues 
of plants, most of which have strong aroma and physi -
ological activity, such as anti-inflammatory, anticon -
vulsant, and antiviral activities, and are widely used as 
starting scaffolds in the synthesis of biologically active 
compounds (Fordjour et  al. 2022; Huang et  al. 2021; 
Salakhutdinov et  al. 2017). Limonene, naturally present 
in herbal essential oil, has pathogen-selective antimi -
crobial activity (da Silva et al. 2021; Du et al. 2014). The 
enantiomeric configuration influences the biological 
activity of limonene, and (−)-limonene is more active 
than (+)-limonene (van Vuuren and viljoen 2007). 
(−)-Perillyl alcohol, a derivative of (−)-limonene, has 
great efficacy in the treatment of a variety of tumors (Hui 
et al. 2014). However, the results in clinical trials are not 
ideal. Thus, further structural optimization has become 
the direction of new drug development researches. Sev -
eral studies on monoterpenoids have shown that amino-
modification can improve their solubility and anti-tumor 
activity (Chen et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006).
The creation of hybrid molecules from natural com -
pounds is a modern and a highly relevant trend in 
medicinal chemistry (Luzina et  al. 2020). (−)-Peril -
lamine plays an important role as an intermediate and 
building block molecule. In recent years, Suslov et  al.

synthesized a series of amides by combining the adaman -
tane and monoterpene moieties to search for novel low 
molecular weight orthopoxvirus inhibitors (Suslov et  al. 
2020). A series of combined fragments of usnic acid and 
monoterpenoids were synthesized with (−)-perillamine 
by Dyrkheeva et  al., affording effective tyrosyl-DNA 
phosphodiesterase I inhibitor for anticancer therapy in 
combination with clinically anticancer drug topotecan 
(Dyrkheeva et al. 2021). These studies highlight the tre -
mendous application value of (−)-perillamine, indicating 
that the efficient synthesis of (−)-perillamine is of great 
significance to the development of new biologically active 
compounds.
The chemical synthesis of (−)-perillamine needs 
expensive catalysts and harsh reaction conditions 
(Dyrkheeva et  al. 2021; Suslov et  al. 2020). Therefore, it 
is of great importance to develop a more sustainable and 
more efficient method for the regioselective amination of 
inert C–H bonds. Biocatalysis has been developed as an 
efficient tool to enrich, expand or even replace the tra -
ditional chemical synthesis methods for pharmaceuti -
cal industry due to its excellent selectivity, mild reaction 
conditions and environmental friendliness. The biologi -
cal cascade reaction combines two or more catalysts to 
catalyze the completion of a series of continuous chemi -
cal reactions (Bruggink et  al. 2003). On the one hand, 
the cascade reaction has higher atomic economy and 
can save reaction space and time; on the other hand, the 
cascade reaction does not need to isolate and purify the 
intermediate products after each reaction step, which 
can effectively improve the utilization rate of the sub -
strate and the yield of the terminal product (Jiang et al. 
2021). In this study, a multi-enzyme cascade reaction sys-
tem was designed and built to realize regiospecific C–H 
amination of (−)-limonene at C-7 position for facile and 
efficient synthesis of the biologically active compound 
(−)-perillamine, by use of P450 hydroxylase, alcohol 
dehydrogenase, and transaminase.
Methods
Chemicals and materials
(−)-Limonene, (−)-perillyl alcohol and (−)-perillyl alde -
hyde were purchased from Energy chemical Ltd. (Shang -
hai, China). All other chemicals of analytical grade or 
higher purity were obtained from commercial sources 
without further purification. Tryptone and yeast extract 
were obtained from Oxoid (Hampshire, UK). Genes 
were synthesized by Genscript Biotech Co. Ltd. (Nan -
jing, China). Formate dehydrogenase from Candida 
boidinii (CbFDH), alcohol dehydrogenase from Lac -
tobacillus kefiri (LkADH), NADH oxidase from Strep -
tococcus mutans (Sm NOX) and w-transaminase from 
Arthrobacter sp. (ATA-117) were obtained from the 
enzyme library deposited in our laboratory.
Gene cloning and expression
The genes encoding LkADH, SmNOX and ATA-117 
were, respectively, ligated into pET-28a and pET-21a 
under the control of T7 promoter and then transformed 
into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for overexpression. Positive trans-
formants and glycerin strains were grown at 37  °C to 
an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8 in Terrific broth 
liquid medium containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin for pET-
21a (or kanamycin for pET-28a). Protein production was 
induced by adding isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM, and the cells 
were cultured for a further 22  h at 16  °C and 220  rpm. 
The protein production of P450pyr required extra sup -
plement of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a final con -
centration of 0.5 mM.
Lyophilized enzyme powders preparation of LkADH, 
SmNOX and ATA‑117
The LkADH, SmNOX and ATA-117 enzymes were over -
expressed as described above. Cells were harvested by 
centrifugation (10,000×g) at 4  °C for 10  min, resus -
pended in KPB buffer (10  mM, pH 7.5). A clear lysate 
was obtained by high-pressure homogenizer and sub -
sequently centrifuged (10,000×g) for 40  min to remove 
cell debris. The supernatant was frozen at − 80 °C over -
night and then lyophilized to obtain the cell-free enzyme 
powders.
Enzyme assay
The specific activities of LkADH and SmNOX were meas-
ured by monitoring the initial change of the absorbance 
of nicotinamide cofactors at 340 nm (e = 6220  M−1  cm−1) 
and 30 °C using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 
Japan). For LkADH, reactions were performed in a 1 mL 
cuvette supplemented with KPB buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) 
containing 10 mM (−)-perillyl alcohol, 1 mM  NAD+, and 
an appropriate amount of enzyme. For Sm NOX, reac -
tions with oxygen-saturated KPB buffer (100  mM, pH 
7.5) containing 0.2 mM NADH.
The transamination activity of w-TA was measured 
by gas chromatography (GC) with (−)-perillyl aldehyde 
as substrate. Reactions were performed in 2-mL Eppen -
dorf tube with 500-µL reaction system containing 10 mM 
(−)-perillyl aldehyde, 80  mM 2-pentanamine, 0.2  mM 
pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) and an appropriate amount 
of enzyme for 45 min at 35 °C. Determination of product 
concentration was done using GC to calculate the spe -
cific activities of ω-TA.

One unit of the enzymatic activity was defined as the 
amount of enzyme catalyzing the reduction (or oxida -
tion) of 1 μmol of the substrate in 1 min.
Analytical methods
The reaction solution (500 μL) was extracted with 500 
μL methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) containing cam -
phor as an internal standard and dried over anhydrous 
 Na2SO4 for 6 h for GC analysis. (−)-Limonene, (−)-per -
illyl alcohol, (−)-perillyl aldehyde and (−)-perillamine 
were measured by Shimadzu-2014 gas chromatogra -
phy equipped with a DB 1701 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 
0.25 μm). The temperature for the injector and detector 
was 250 °C, and the column temperature was first set at 
80℃ for 2 min, raised to 200 ℃ at 5 ℃  min−1 and held for 
2 min. The inlet volume of the sample was 1 μL and the 
split ratio was 20:1.
Biocatalytic cascade reaction in one pot
The analytical-scale one-pot reaction mixture (0.5  mL) 
contained 10 mM (−)-limonene (with 2% v/v DMSO), 15 
 gcdw/L A7F resting cells, 100 mM sodium formate, 1 mg/
mL Triton X-100, and KPB buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5). The 
reaction mixtures were shaken at 25 °C and 800 rpm for 
2 h. After the reaction mixture was heated at 65 °C in a 
water bath for 0.5 h and cooled to room temperature, the 
Module-2 reaction was initiated by supplementing 0.2 
U  mL−1 LkADH, 1.0 U  mL−1 SmNOX, 2 U  mL−1 ATA-
117, 0.2  mM  NAD+, 0.2  mM PLP , and 80  mM 2-pen -
tanamine and continued by incubation at 35 °C for 12 h. 
To terminate the reaction, was added 10 μL NaOH solu -
tion (10 M) before the reaction mixture was extracted by 
0.5 mL MTBE. The organic extract was dried with anhy -
drous  Na2SO4 and analyzed by GC.
Preparative‑scale reaction
A preparative-scale mixture (100  mL), containing 
100  mM KPB buffer (pH 7.5), 10  mM (− )-limonene, 
15  gcdw  L−1 A7F resting cells, 0.2 mM  NAD+, 100 mM 
sodium formate, 1  mg/mL Triton X-100, was shaken 
at 25 °C and 200 rpm for 2 h. After the hydroxylation 
step was completed, the reaction mixture was heated 
at 65  °C in a water bath for 35  min, and then cooled 
to room temperature. Subsequently, all the elements 
desired for Module 2, including 0.2 U  mL−1 LkADH, 1.0 
U  mL−1 SmNOX, 2 U  mL−1 ATA-117, 0.2 mM  NAD+, 
0.2  mM PLP and 80  mM 2-pentanamine, were sup -
plemented into the reaction system and agitated mag -
netically at 35 °C for 12 h. Then 2 mL NaOH solution 
(10  M) was added to terminate the reaction before 
being extracted with MTBE. The organic extract was 
dried over anhydrous  Na2SO4. The final precipitate was 
evaporated again under reduced pressure and dried 
under vacuum to give (− )-perillamine.
Results and discussion
Design of a modularized multi‑enzymatic cascade 
for converting (−)‑limonene into (−)‑perillamine
In the cascade process, (− )-limonene was initially 
hydroxylated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme to pro -
duce (− )-perillyl alcohol. The (− )-perillyl alcohol was 
further oxidized by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 
to produce (− )-perillyl aldehyde and then aminated 
by an w-transaminase (w-TA) to give (− )-perillamine 
simultaneously. We tried to recycle the effective nico -
tine cofactor by introducing a formate dehydrogenase 
(FDH) and an NADH oxidase (NOX) for regenerating 
the desired NADH (for C–H monooxygenation) and 
 NAD+ (for alcohol dehydrogenation), respectively. 
Considering the instability of P450 enzymes and the 
interference between the two coenzyme recycling sys -
tems which might result in a thermodynamic balance, 
we divided this cascade into two independent modules 
(Module 1 and Module 2). Module 1 was composed of 
a P450 enzyme and an FDH for effectively hydroxylat -
ing (−)-limonene to (− )-perillyl alcohol, while Module 
2 comprises an ADH, an NOX and an w-TA to trans -
form the (− )-perillyl alcohol into (− )-perillamine 
(Scheme 1 ).
Recruiting enzymes for constructing Module 1
Terpenoid hydroxylases are mainly cytochrome P450 
enzymes, which have significant substrate promiscu -
ity. According to the type of reaction catalyzed by the 
enzyme and the structure of substrate, we selected sev -
eral terpene hydroxylases for the first hydroxylation 
step. Through functional characterization, we found that 
CYP153A7 could catalyze the regiospecific hydroxylation 
of (−)-limonene into (−)-perillyl alcohol. CYP153A7, 
originated from Sphingomonas sp. HXN-200, is a class I 
P450 enzyme with a broad substrate scope and applica -
tions (Chang et  al. 2000, 2002a, b; Dong et  al. 2022; Li 
et  al. 2001). It requires ferredoxin (Fdx) and ferredoxin 
reductase (FdR) for electron transfer and can be used for 
the regio- and stereo-selective hydroxylation of non-acti -
vated carbon atoms (Pham et al. 2012; Yang and Li 2015). 
Therefore, we utilized an engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) 
strain (A7F), constructed previously in our laboratory, 
which co-expresses the CYP153A7 gene with its redox 
partners (Fdx & FdR) and a formate dehydrogenase from 
Candida boidinii  (CbFDH) (Hummel 1999; Slusarczyk 
et  al. 2000; Tang et  al. 2021) for the effective cofactor 
regeneration.

Recruiting enzymes for constructing Module 2
Considering the high similarity of the chemical structures 
between (−)-perillyl alcohol and p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-ol, 
we tested the toolbox of p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-ol dehy -
drogenases preserved in our laboratory and found that 
a double mutant of alcohol dehydrogenase, LkADH T91F/
I195V from Lactobacillus kefiri (LkADH), could catalyze 
the oxidation of (−)-perillyl alcohol into (−)-perillyl 
aldehyde. In order to regenerate the consumed cofactor 
NADH, we introduced a variant of the highly efficient 
NADH oxidase, Sm NOXV193R/V194H from Streptococcus 
mutans (Sm NOX) (Jiao et  al. 2016). Since many w-TAs 
were reported for the transamination of aldehydes, we 
first screened a panel of TAs preserved in our labora -
tory for the enzymatic amination of (−)-perillyl alde -
hyde. ATA-117 from Arthrobacter sp. was found to be 
the most efficient enzyme, exhibiting a high catalytic 
activity toward (−)-perillyl aldehyde, approximately 
2.8  μmol   min−1   mg−1 lyophilized enzyme powders. 
Therefore, ATA-117 was finally chosen as the transami -
nase for our work, which was previously reported to be 
highly productive for the biocatalytic synthesis of sitag -
liptin after 11 rounds of directed evolution (Gomm et al. 
2016; Guan et al. 2015; Savile et al. 2010).
Optimizing the cascade reactions of Module 1
Subsequently, we tried to improve the reaction effi -
ciency of Module 1. As shown in Table  1, the effects of a 
few parameters such as temperature, pH, substrate con -
centration, cell dosage and whether to add surfactants 
were investigated. The titer of (− )-perillyl alcohol was 
a little bit higher at pH 7.5, and on this basis, we low -
ered the reaction temperature to 25 ℃ . To our sur -
prise, the concentration of formed (− )-perillyl alcohol 
was doubled. Strangely, an increase in the cell dosage 
from 5 to 20  gcdw/L resulted in a slight decrease in the 
analytic yield of the final product. This might be caused 
by the increase of the viscosity of the reaction system, 
which may affect the mass transfer rate. To address this 
problem, we tried to add 1 mg/mL of Triton X-100 to 
the reaction system. Finally, under the conditions of 
15  gcdw/L cell dosage, 10  mM substrate and 1  mg/mL 
Triton X-100, the concentration of product (− )-per-
illyl alcohol reached 6.8  mM. Partial volatilization of 
(−)-limonene led to the loss of substrate (Cornelissen 
et  al. 2013), as confirmed in a system without cells, 
while the remaining (− )-limonene (ca.  68%) was com -
pletely oxidized into (− )-perillyl alcohol.

Optimizing the cascade reactions of Module 2
In order to optimize the reaction efficiency of Module 2, 
the effects of a few parameters were examined, includ -
ing temperature, pH, amine donor and cofactor doses 
were examined. Based on actual effects on the reaction, 
the optimal pH and temperature for the reaction were 
pH 7.5 and 35 ℃ (Fig.  1). In a one-pot reaction, there are 
multiple enzymes coexisting in the same space. In order 
to improve the overall efficiency of cascaded reactions, 
it is important to coordinate the ratio of each element 
added into the system. We have investigated the ratio of 
the three enzyme doses in Module 2, suggesting that the 
optimal dose ratio of [LkADH]/[Sm NOX]/[ATA-117] 
should be 1:2:10 (Additional file  1: Fig. S1). After deter -
mining the proportion of the enzyme added, we exam -
ined the effect of enzyme doses. Keeping a constant ratio 
of the three enzymes, the product titer increased with 
the increase in the enzyme doses. When the amount of 
LkADH was 0.2 U/mL, the product titer was the highest, 
so the optimum dose of LkADH was fixed to be 0.2 U/mL 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S2).
Transaminases have the significant advantages that 
do not require redox cofactors, however the unfavora -
ble thermodynamic equilibrium of enzymes limits its 
application (Kelefiotis-Stratidakis et al. 2019). The amino 
donor may be an important factor to overcome the short-
comings of reaction equilibrium. We optimized the type 
and amounts of amino donors. Among several commonly 
used amine donors, 2-pentanamine is the most effec -
tive one (Fig.  2A). In previous studies, researchers usu -
ally added excessive amounts of amino donor to shift 
the equilibrium [14], but excessive amino donor will also 
impair the activity of enzyme. The product titer was the 
highest when 80  mM 2-pentanamine was added to the 
reaction system (Fig.  2B). In addition, the doses of cofac -
tors  NAD+ and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) were also 
optimized, indicating that 0.2  mM  NAD+ and 0.2  mM 
PLP were sufficient for the cascaded reaction (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S3). Through the optimization of Module 2, the 
titer of (−)-perillamine was increased up to nearly 7 mM.
One‑pot two‑step cascade reactions
Initially, we tried one-pot one-step and one-pot two-
step modes to perform this cascade reaction, respec -
tively. When we performed the cascaded reaction in the 
one-pot one-step mode, only a trace amount of the final 
product (−)-perillamine was detected. The efficiency of 
the cascade reaction was relatively low, implying that the 
one-pot one-step mode might be not conducive to the 
catalytic reaction of unstable  P450 enzyme in the com -
plicated reaction system. Therefore, the cascade reactions 
were alternatively performed in a one-pot two-step mode. 
When the cascaded reactions of Module 1 were com -
plete, the reaction mixture was heated in a 65  °C water 
bath to inactivate formate dehydrogenase to avoid any 
interference with the subsequent coenzyme recycling. All 
the elements desired for Module 2 were supplemented 
into the reaction system after being cooled to room tem -
perature and the incubation was continued for 12  h. In 
the one-pot two-step mode, the titer of (−)-perillamine 
had a slight increase to approximately 2 mM, suggesting 
that there was another bottleneck existing in our cascade 
reaction system. Through step-by-step investigation, we 
found that only a trace amount of (−)-perillyl aldehyde 
could be detected in the dehydrogenation step cata -
lyzed by LkADH. By measuring the activity of Sm NOX, 
it turned out that the surfactant added in Module 1 had 
negative effects on the enzyme activity of SmNOX (Addi-
tional file  1: Table S1) and the recycling efficiency of the 
cofactor. Therefore, we had to increase the Sm NOX dose

from 0.2 to 1 U/mL for a compensation, which resulted in 
a significant increase of the product titer.
100‑mL preparative‑scale cascade reaction
Under the optimized conditions, we carried out a 100 mL 
preparative-scale cascade reaction, where the time-
course analysis revealed that the formation of (−)-peril -
lamine reached a maximum 5.4  mM at approximately 
12  h  (Fig. 3). Since monoterpenoids are extremely vola -
tile, it was difficult to accurately determine their content. 
We only monitor the concentrations of the intermedi -
ate product (−)-perillyl alcohol, and the final product 
(−)-perillamine, which are relatively not easy to be vol -
atilized. The reaction of Module 1 quickly reached the 
end point in 2  h, and there was no significant increase 
in product titer when the reaction time was prolonged. 
After the reaction mixture of Module 2 was supple -
mented, the resulting (−)-perillyl alcohol in Module 1 
was rapidly converted into (−)-perillyl aldehyde, accom -
panied by the formation of (−)-perillamine as the final 
product. The product was isolated from the reaction sys -
tem and purified by silica gel column chromatography, 
giving 76 mg (−)-perillamine with a space–time yield of 
1.5 g  L−1  d−1. 1H-NMR (400 MHz,  CDCl3) δ/ppm (Addi-
tional file  1: Fig. S4): 5.58 (brs, 1H), 4.71 (brs, 2H), 3.17 
(brs, 2H), 2.19–1.85 (m, 7H), 1.73 (s, 3H), 1.53–1.40 (m, 
1H). 13C NMR (101 MHz,  CDCl3) δ/ppm: 149.97, 138.50, 
120.22, 108.56, 47.92, 41.28, 30.50, 27.64, 27.12, 20.81.
Conclusions
In summary, by recruiting hydroxylase, alcohol dehy -
drogenase, transaminase, formate dehydrogenase and 
NADH oxidase, a redox self-sufficient and concise 
multi-enzyme cascade reaction was successfully con -
structed to transform the cheap and easily available 
(−)-limonene into (− )-perillamine for the first time. 
After optimization of the two modules, 10 mM loaded 
(−)-limonene was smoothly converted into 5.4  mM 
(−)-perillamine in 12  h. Our work is of great signifi -
cance for the development of new biologically active 
compounds. More works of molecular evolution, pro -
tein engineering and process optimization may be 
necessary to further improve the performance of the 
one-pot biotransformation and to minimize the waste 
of the excessive co-substrate. It is envisioned that this 
elegant enzymatic route might be applied for bioamina -
tion of many other terpenoids, such as pinene, geraniol, 
citronellol, etc., especially for the synthesis of the bio -
logically active compounds with promising application 
prospects.
