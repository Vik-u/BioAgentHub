Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important intermediate compound in the chemical
industry. Green and environmentally friendly microbial synthesis methods are becoming increasingly
popular in a range of industries. Compared to other chassis cells, Yarrowia lipolytica possesses
advantages, such as high tolerance to organic acid and a sufﬁcient precursor required to synthesize
3-HP . In this study, gene manipulations, including the overexpression of genes MCR-NCa , MCR-
CCa , GAPNSm, ACC1 and ACSL641P
Se and knocking out bypass genes MLS1 and CIT2, leading to the
glyoxylate cycle, were performed to construct a recombinant strain. Based on this, the degradation
pathway of 3-HP in Y. lipolytica was discovered, and relevant genes MMSDH and HPDH were
knocked out. To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to produce 3-HP in Y. lipolytica. The yield of
3-HP in recombinant strain Po1f-NC-14 in shake ﬂask fermentation reached 1.128 g·L−1, and the yield
in fed-batch fermentation reached 16.23 g ·L−1. These results are highly competitive compared to
other yeast chassis cells. This study creates the foundation for the production of 3-HP in Y. lipolytica
and also provides a reference for further research in the future.
Keywords: 3-hydroxypropionic acid; Yarrowia lipolytica; malonyl-CoA; degradation
1. Introduction
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP , C3H6O3) was listed as 1 of the 12 kinds of platform
chemicals with the greatest potential by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004. It
has great application prospects and market value [ 1]. Many industry chemicals can be
synthesized through diverse chemical reactions using 3-HP as material, such as malonic
acid, 1,3-propanediol, acrylic acid, β-propiolactone, etc. [2]. Biodegradable plastics, includ-
ing poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) [ 3] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) [ 4], can
also be synthesized using 3-HP or its esteriﬁed derivatives. They have broad prospects in
substituting for traditional petroleum-based plastics. Due to the high demand for 3-HP in
the market, a high-yield 3-HP synthesis method is the current research focus. There are
some general disadvantages in traditional chemical synthesis methods, such as the high
cost of the starting materials and process, as well as the environmental incompatibility of
the chemical approaches. Therefore, it is more suitable to obtain 3-HP using a biosynthesis
method [5].
Researchers initially tried to synthesize 3-HP using prokaryote as a platform. Be-
cause of the clear genetic background and diversiﬁed gene manipulation tools, Escherichia
coli became the ﬁrst choice for the heterologous expression for production of 3-HP [ 6].
The Park research group expressed glycerol dehydratase (DHAB) from Klebsiella pneumonia
and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from Escherichia coli in E. coli BL21, and the initial
yield of 3-HP was 0.58 g ·L−1 by ﬂask fermentation [ 7]. After optimizing the conditions
in terms of pH, medium composition, dissolved oxygen, etc., the concentration of 3-HP
reached 31 g·L−1 in a fed-batch culture using a 5 L bioreactor [ 8]. On this basis, the re-
searchers switched the chassis strain to E. coli BL21(DE3), which had stronger tolerance to

3-HP and overexpressed glycerol dehydratase (DHAB) and its activators GdrA and GdrB
from K. pneumoniae and α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH) from
Azospirillum brasilense. The yield of 3-HP was increased by 24.8% to 38.7 g·L−1 in a fed-batch
culture [9]. With the premise of overexpressing the key rate-limiting enzyme, knocking
out the bypass pathway genes can also increase the yield of target product. Another re-
search work knocked out ACKA, PTA, YQHD, which are the key genes used to synthesize
acetic acid and ethanol after expressing the mutated succinic semialdehyde dehydroge-
nase (GabD4 _E209Q/E269Q) from Cupriavidus necator and glycerol dehydratase (DHAB)
from K. pneumoniae. The yield of 3-HP reached by 71.9 g ·L−1 in a fed-batch culture [10],
which was the highest yield of 3-HP synthesized in E. coli using glycerol as the substrate.
Additionally, researchers tried to synthesize 3-HP through the malonyl-CoA pathway
in E. coli. Malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) from Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus and acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC) from Corynebacterium glutamicum were expressed in E. coli, and the
yield of 3-HP reached 10.08 g ·L−1 after 36 h fermentation in a fed-batch culture [11]. In
order to fundamentally improve the activity of the limiting enzyme, researchers found
that the enzyme activity of malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) from C. aurantiacus was severely
inhibited under the condition of the bacterial culture temperature. The MCR was split into
two different functional structures MCR-N and MCR-C to catalyze reactions individually.
Finally, the yield of 3-HP reached 40.6 g ·L−1 in a fed-batch culture [ 12]. Comparing to
E. coli, K. pneumoniae has stable glycerol dehydratase (DHAB) and activators; it can also
synthesize VB12, which is the key co-enzyme in the glycerol pathway. To explore gene
modiﬁcation from another research direction, researchers overexpressed aldehyde de-
hydrogenase (ALDH) from Pseudomonas sp. and used an appropriate promoter tac. The
chassis cell was also knocked out the bypass gene LDH1, LDH2 and PTA. The yield of 3-HP
reached 83.8 g·L−1 3-HP [13]. They recruited three tandem repetitive tac promoters to
overexpress an endogenous ALDH (PUUC) and obtained 102.6 g·L−1 3-HP , which was the
highest yield reported so far [14].
The most significant problem with the prokaryotic production of 3-HP is that the
prokaryotic chassis strain cannot tolerate low pH and product toxicity. Therefore, the re-
searchers started performing the heterologous synthesis of 3-HP with yeast [15]. The re-
searchers expressed the mutated acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase (ACC_S659A/
S1157A) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and preliminarily synthesized 3-HP; the yield was
0.28 g·L−1 [16]. On this basis, they expressed a series malonyl-CoA pathway key genes in
S. cerevisiae, including MCRCa , ACC1, ALD6, ACESE, ADH2, and knocked out MLS1 which
encodes cytosolic malate synthase; the yield of 3-HP reached 0.46 g·L−1 [17]. In another
study, gene expression cassettes PTEF1BS123-MCR and PHXT1-FAS1 were constructed in
S. cerevisiae. The malonyl-CoA sensor was developed based on the FapR transcription factor
of Bacillus subtilis and applied in S. cerevisiae. The yield of 3-HP reached 0.8 g ·L−1 [18].
In contrast with conventional metabolic regulation, for a different type of study, researchers
designed a malonyl-CoA sensor in S. cerevisiae using an adapted bacterial transcription
factor FapR and its corresponding operator fapO to gauge intracellular malonyl-CoA levels.
Meanwhile, they co-overexpressed the two novel gene targets PMP1 and TPL1, which
were discovered by integrated sensor–genetic screening and achieved a concentration
of 3-HP of 1.2 g·L−1 [19]. In addition, another research study expressed four heterolo-
gous genes in P . pastoris, encoding for two functional domains of malonyl-CoA reductase
from C. aurantiacus (MCR-N, MCR-C), acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Y. lipolytica (ACCYl ),
and cytosolic NADH kinase from S. cerevisiae (cPOSSc). The recombinant strain was fer-
mented in a 5 L bioreactor by a fed-batch culture, achieving a ﬁnal concentration of 3-HP of
24.75 g·L−1 [20].
Yarrowia lipolytica, a representative unconventional yeast, is generally recognized as
a safe strain (GRAS), and it can be safely used in supplements for people over 3 years
old [21]. As an excellent heterologous expression chassis strain, Y. lipolytica synthesizes
multiple metabolites, including organic acids, lipases, fatty acids, terpenoids, etc. [22]. Prof.
Catherine Madzak modiﬁed Y. lipolytica (W29, ATCC20460), obtaining Po1d series strains
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 3 of 19
(Po1d, Po1e, Po1f, Po1g, and Po1h), which knocked out the alkaline protease coding gene
AEP and integrated gene SUC in the Po1d strain, which can cause the strain to use sucrose
as substrate. Based on the Po1d strain, Po1f strain knocked out the acid protease coding
gene AXP and eliminated the adverse effect of extracellular protease on the expression of
the foreign protein [23–25]. In addition, Prof. Catherine Madzak also developed a series of
pINA plasmids, including pINA1312 and pINA1269 [26,27]. The strong promoter hp4d was
used in the pINA plasmids; it is a growth-dependent promoter that needs no induction and
is scarcely affected by the environment, allowing the foreign protein to be expressed in the
early stationary phase of cell growth [28]. To increase the efﬁciency of plasmid integration,
the researchers added a zeta sequence to the plasmid. The function of the zeta sequence is
that it improves the efﬁciency of foreign DNA integration into the genome of Y. lipolytica
(Ylt1∆) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and provides a new way to integrate into
the genome of Y. lipolytica by NHEJ [29].
In this study, the production of 3-HP using glucose as substrate was obtained in
Y. lipolytica through the malonyl-CoA pathway (Figure 1A). We introduced a series of
exogenous genes into this pathway, including MCR from C. aurantiacus, ACSL641P from
Salmonella enterica, and overexpressed endogenous ACC1. Meanwhile, the malonyl-CoA
reductase was separated into two subunits, which showed higher 3-HP production. Further,
GAPN from Streptococcus mutans was overexpressed to supply NADPH to the system, and
the extra added pyruvic acid provided more precursors to the malonyl-CoA pathway.
In addition, in order to ensure more ﬂuxes to 3-HP , we knocked out genes MLS1 and
CIT2, which introduced more ﬂuxes into the glyoxylate cycle. To solve resolve the 3-HP
degradation, we also tried to break the malonate semialdehyde pathway in Y. lipolytica
by knocking out genes HPDH and MMSDH, leading to greater accumulation of 3-HP
(Figure 1B). Overall, the potential of Y. lipolytica as a promising chassis strain for 3-HP
production was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time. In comparison to prokaryotic chassis cells,
Y. lipolytica has a more suitable fermentation environment for 3-HP (pKa: 4.5) and is more
tolerant to the toxicity effects of 3-HP . Our study also provides new insights for increasing
the production of 3-HP in the future.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Strain and Plasmid Construction
The E.coli strain JM109 was used for plasmid construction and propagation in this
study. The auxotrophic Y. lipolytica strain Po1f (MATa, Leu2−, Ura3−; Catherine Madzak,
Paris-Saclay University, INRA, AgroParisTech, UMR SayFood, Palaiseau, France) was used
as the initial strain. All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1, and all recombinant
yeast strains were derived from the Po1f strain (Table 2). The plasmids were digested by
a restriction enzyme and connected using a ClonExpress Ultra One Step Cloning Kit. All
expression cassette were assembled using a strong constitutive hp4d promoter and XPR2
terminator. The overexpression of genes was carried out using the pINA1312 plasmid with
URA3ex as a marker and hp4d as a promoter. The expression of genes with diverse copies
was carried out using the pINA1269 plasmid with LEU2ex as a marker and hp4d as a
promoter. In particular, to increase the translation efﬁciency in Y. lipolytica, we constructed
a CACAATG sequence in the gene expression cassettes by adding an “A” before the ﬁrst
codon of the protein of interest (ATG) after digestion by PmlI [30]. All sequences of genes
investigated in this study are shown in Table S1.
CRISPR/Cas9 vector (JME4580) with HPHex was used to knock out relevant bypass
genes [31]. The origin vector was digested by BsmBI to cut off the E. coli red ﬂuorescent
protein chromophore (RFP) gene and replace it using a sgRNA sequence, which was
designed in CRISPOR (version 5.01). All sgRNAs and relevant information are shown in
Table S2. The positive transformants can be selected by the color of the colony.

Y. lipolytica transformation was carried out by ZYMO Frozen-EZ yeast transformation
II kit [33]. Different types of yeast expression recombinant transformants were selected on
SD-Ura and SD-Leu media. The knockout system included a 500 ng CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid
and a 500 ng donor fragment. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion transformants were selected on a
YPD-hygromycin B medium plate. After veriﬁcation, the transformants were transferred
into YPD media for several generations to allow plasmid curing and were selected on YPD
media for the next gene manipulation.
2.2. Materials and Yeast Cultivation
E. coli with recombinant plasmid was cultivated in Luria Bertani (LB) medium con-
taining 10 g·L−1 of tryptone, 5 g ·L−1 of yeast extract and 10 g ·L−1. Suitable antibiotics
were added in the LB medium plate when necessary at the following ﬁnal concentrations:
kanamycin 50 mg·L−1, and ampicillin 100 mg·L−1. Y. lipolytica and recombinant strains
were cultivated in a yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (20 g·L−1 of tryptone,
20·L−1 of yeast extract and 20 g ·L−1 of glucose) or yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium
(6.7 g·L−1 of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 10 g·L−1 of glucose). The appropriate
SD minimal medium was used to select positive yeast transformants such that suitable
nutrients were added to the YNB medium plate at the following ﬁnal concentrations:
uracil 0.1 g·L−1 and leucine 0.1 g·L−1. Hygromycin B (250 mg·L−1) was added to the YPD
medium plate to select CRISPR/Cas9 deletion transformants. Next, 1.5 g·L−1 of agar was
added to the solid medium. The genome DNA of yeast was extracted via the CTAB method
after grinding with liquid nitrogen. The plasmid extraction kit, ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis
kit, SYBR qpcr master mix kit, gel extraction kit, one-step cloning kit and DNA puriﬁcation
kit were all from Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Primer synthesis and Sanger
sequencing were performed by Comate Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Changchun, China). All
genes were codon optimized and synthesized by General Biosystems (Anhui) Co., Ltd.
(Chuzhou, China). All culture media and relevant reagents were purchased from Biosharp
Life sciences Co., Ltd. (Hefei, China).
E. coli was cultured by LB medium at 37 ◦C and 180 rpm overnight for plasmid
construction and propagation. Y. lipolytica strains were cultured by YPD medium, and
recombinant strains were cultured by the corresponding SD minimal medium. All strains
were incubated in 5 mL medium and grown at 30 ◦C, 220 rpm to reach an OD 600 of 1.0.
After that, an initial OD600 of 0.01 yeast was added to 50 mL medium and cultured at 30 ◦C
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 7 of 19
220 rpm for 5 days. All the ﬂask fermentation results represent the mean ± S.D. of three
independent experiments. CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion transformants were selected on the
YPD-hyg solid medium, and plasmid curing was carried out by culturing in YPD medium
for several generations. After that, the transformants were used to perform the next gene
knockout manipulation. In addition, 2 g ·L−1, 4 g·L−1, and 6 g·L−1 of pyruvic acid were
added to the medium of strain Po1f-NC-14 to increase the production of 3-HP by adding
a precursor.
2.3. Enzyme Assay
The recombinant strains Po1f, Po1f-tMCR and Po1f-NC-00 were cultured in an ap-
propriate SD minimal medium and harvested in the mid-exponential phase. Cells were
collected and washed with pre-cooled 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4).
Meanwhile, cells were resuspended in PBS in a ratio of 1/20 and lysed using Vibra-Cell
ultrasonic liquid processors VC505 (Sonics, Newtown, CT, USA). The lysing conditions
included an output power of 500 w; total working time of 15 min; single working time of
7 s; and a gap time of 5 s. An ice box was needed in the lysing environment to reduce the
temperature and maintain the biological activity of protein. Lysates were centrifuged at
12,000× g for 20 min at 4 ◦C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube to measure
the concentration of total protein using a BCA protein quantiﬁcation kit. Malonyl-CoA
reductase activity was measured at 30 ◦C by mixed buffer (0.3 mL), containing 0.3 mM
NADPH, 3 mM DTE, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Next, 0.3 mM malonyl-CoA
was added into the mixed buffer as a substrate, and the reaction started after the super-
natant was added. The assay was monitored at 365 nm (ϵNADPH = 3400 M−1cm−1). For
MCRCA and MCR-N/ MCR-C, one unit of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme that oxidized 2 µmol of NADPH per minute, corresponding to the enzyme amount
required to convert 1 µmol of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP . All the experiments were performed
in triplicate.
2.4. Analytical Methods
The yeast growth curve was drawn according to the OD600 of the fermentation broth
at different times. The OD 600 of fermentation broth was measured with an ultraviolet
spectrophotometer from Aucy scientiﬁc instrument Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and diluted
to between 0.3 and 0.8 to ensure linearity of the results. Next, 5 mL fermentation broth,
which was cultured after 5 days, was added to 10 ml centrifuge tube and dried to a
constant weight in an oven at 105 ◦C after washing with deionized water. The dry cell
weight (DCW) (g·L−1) was calculated by dividing the cell dry weight by the volume of the
fermentation broth.
The concentration of 3-HP was determined by high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy (HPLC). Fermentation broth samples were centrifuged at 12,000× g for 10 min, and the
supernatants were ﬁltered through a 0.22 µm nitrocellulose ﬁlter and analyzed by Wa-
ters2695 HPLC (Milford, CT, USA) with an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm,
3.5 µm) and UV detector. The HPLC conditions were as follows: the injection volume was
10 µL; ratio of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid aqueous solution with pH 2) and mobile
phase B (0.1 % formic acid acetonitrile solution with pH 3) was 95:5; the constant ﬂow
rate was 0.6 mL·min−1; and the column temperature was 30 ◦C. HPLC-MS analysis was
determined by Waters ZQ2000 mass spectrometer (MS) with an ion source of ESI, an ion
source temperature of 140 ◦C, an atomization temperature of 350◦C, and a voltage of 3.5 kV .
The SBA-40C biosensor (Biology Institute of Shandong Academy of Science, Jinan, China)
was used to determine the glucose concentration of the fermentation broth samples. All the
experiments were performed in triplicate.
2.5. Rna Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The total RNA of yeast was isolated and puriﬁed via the TRIZOL method. The cDNA
was synthesized using the HiScript III 1st cDNA synthesis kit from Vazyme Biotech Co.,
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 8 of 19
Ltd. (Nanjing, China). The relative expression level of different copies of genes, including
ACC1, ACSL641P
Se and ALD6, was calculated using the the relative quantitative 2 −∆∆Ct
method (compared with Po1f). The mRNA derived from actin was used to normalize the
relative expression levels as the internal standard. The AceQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master
mix (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) was used to prepare the qPCR reaction system.
The experiment was accomplished by the ViiA7 Real-Time PCR instrument (ABI, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). All samples were prepared in triplicate to obtain the Ct value.
2.6. Fed-Batch Fermentation
The fed-batch fermentation was carried out in a 1 L bioreactor (Biotech-JG, Shanghai,
China). First, an initial OD600 of 0.01 of strain Po1f-NC-14 was inoculated into a 250 mL
ﬂask which had 50 mL of the YPD medium and was cultured at 30 ◦C at 220 rpm for 24 h.
After that, 1 mL of fermentation broth was inoculated into 100 mL of the YPD medium
and cultured in the same conditions for 24 h. The initial fermentation volume was 500 mL,
including the medium (50 g ·L−1 of glucose, 20 g·L−1 of tryptone, and 10 g ·L−1 of yeast
extract), and the inoculum volume was 10%. The fermentation condition was set as follows:
pH, 6.0; air ﬂux, 1.5 vvm; and stirring rate, 550 rpm. The pH was maintained by adding
with5M NaOH and 5M HCl. Additionally, 10 × of the YPD medium was added to the
bioreactor to ensure that the concentration of glucose in the fermentation broth reached no
less than 10 g·L−1. The total fed-batch fermentation time was 240 h, and the concentrations
of 3-HP , glucose and OD600 were measured every 12 h. The ﬁnal concentrations were
determined by three independent replicates.
3. Results
3.1. Construction of Malonyl-CoA Pathway for Synthesis of 3-HP in Y. lipolytica
The genes involved in the conversion of glucose to 3-HP of the malonyl-CoA pathway
are shown in Figure 1A. Owing to Y. lipolytica having the characteristic of accumulating
a large amount of fatty acids by itself, according to the main metabolic pathway, it has a
relatively sufﬁcient number of malonyl-CoA precursors [34]. Additionally, Y. lipolytica is
more tolerant of organic acids [35]. Based on the above two advantages, this study selected
Y. lipolytica as the chassis cell to synthesize 3-HP through the malonyl-CoA pathway
from glucose. According to the literature, we introduced MCR from C. aurantiacus into
Y. lipolytica to construct the basic pathway, including the codon-optimizedMCR gene. More
notably, in order to improve the activity of the MCR enzyme, we divided theMCR gene
(AY530019.1) into two segments [36]. The termination codon ‘TAA’ was added at the end
of the N-terminal region of the MCR DNA sequence, and the starting codon ‘ATG’ was
added at the beginning of the C-terminal region of the MCR DNA sequence. MCR-N
(550aa) and MCR-C (671aa) showed a higher afﬁnity for malonyl-CoA than MCR. Wild-
type wMCR from pTrc99a-wMCR, codon-optimizedtMCR, codon-optimized MCR-N and
MCR-C were all separately connected between the hp4d promoter and XPR2 terminator
in pINA1312. After that, p1312-wMCR, p1312-tMCR and p1312-tMCRN-tMCRC were
separately transformed into the genome of Y. lipolytica to obtain Po1f-wMCR, Po1f-tMCR
and Po1f-NC-00. To explore the MCR enzyme activity of the three types of recombinant
strains, they were tested using the enzyme assay method. The enzyme activity result in
Figure 2A shows that Po1f-NC-00 had much greater MCR enzyme activity (22 mU·mg−1)
than Po1f-tMCR (14 mU·mg−1). Meanwhile, Po1f-wMCR did not exhibit corresponding
enzyme activity. It can be inferred that gene MCR from C. aurantiacus cannot be directly
expressed in Y. lipolytica without codon optimization. On this basis, we found that splitting
the MCR enzyme into two subunits can signiﬁcantly improve the enzyme activity.
In order to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the production of 3-HP in the
Po1f strain and recombinant strain fermentation broth, Po1f, Po1f-wMCR, Po1f-tMCR
and Po1f-NC-00 strains were cultured in YPD, and the fermentation broth samples were
analyzed by the modiﬁed HPLC method after centrifuging and ﬁltering. The identiﬁcation
of 3-HP in fermentation broth was accomplished using the HPLC-MS method. The results

are shown in Figure 2B, where HPLC analysis ﬁnds a peak that coincides with the standard
sample (1.946 g·L−1) at a retention time of 2.1 min. Meanwhile, the result of HPLC-MS
analysis in Figure 2C shows that the compound has a molecular ion at m/z-H 89.04 under
the negative ion monitoring mode, which is identical to that of 3-HP .

glucose consumption of strains Po1f and Po1f-NC-00 during 120 h fermentation. Data represent the
mean ± SD of biological triplicates in (A,D).
In order to determine the most suitable fermentation time for 3-HP accumulation
and ﬁnd the relationship between 3-HP production and glucose in the fermentation broth,
Po1f and Po1f-NC-00 strains were cultured in YPD (glucose concentration: 20 g ·L−1) at
30 ◦C, 220 rpm in a 250 mL ﬂask for 120 h. The concentrations of 3-HP and glucose in
fermentation broth were determined every 24 h. The results in Figure 2D show that the
glucose consumption rates of Po1f and Po1f-NC-00 strains are relatively close. In the early
stage of fermentation, the glucose consumption rate of Po1f-NC-00 strain was slightly
faster than Po1f, possibly due to the supplementation of the URA3 auxotroph marker
to the genome of Y. lipolytica, which made its growth rate faster than that of Po1f strain.
During the ﬁrst 24 h of fermentation, Po1f-NC-00 cannot produce 3-HP . The concentration
of 3-HP in the fermentation broth reached its maximum at 96 h, and 3-HP degradation
occurred after 96 h. This indicates that 3-HP production stopped as glucose was depleted,
while the initial strain of Po1f could not produce 3-HP . Therefore, we chose 96 h as the end
time for fermentation to measure the concentration of 3-HP in the fermentation broth of
Po1f-wMCR, Po1f-tMCR and Po1f-NC-00. In the Po1f-tMCR strain, 0.203 g ·L−1 of 3-HP
(DCW: 27.93 mg·g−1) was accumulated . The concentration of 3-HP reached 0.353 g·L−1
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 10 of 19
(DCW: 46.68 mg·g−1) in the Po1f-NC-00 strain. Splitting the MCR into two parts improved
the 3-HP titer by 1.74-fold; therefore, we chose to modify the pathway based on the Po1f-
NC-00 strain.
3.2. Optimization of NADPH Supply to Increase 3-HP Production
As shown in Figure 1, generating 1 mole of 3-HP requires 2 moles of NADPH, while
MCRCa requires more NADPH to synthesize higher yields of 3-HP . Therefore, it is necessary
to improve the system’s reducing power. According to the literature, we introduced the non-
phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPN) from B. cereus
and S. mutans into the MCR pathway to improve the NADPH level [ 37,38]. In order to
supply NADPH to a greater extent,GAPNBc and GAPNSm were connected to the pINA1312
plasmid for overexpression, enabling more copies of the gene expression cassette to be
integrated into the genome ofY. lipolyticathrough the NHEJ-mediated method. The gene
expression cassettes of GAPNBc and GAPNSm were connected to p1312-tMCRN-tMCRC
using a seamless connection method to obtain Plasmids p1312-NC-GAPNBc and p1312-NC-
GAPNSm. They were transformed to Y. lipolytica, and the yield of 3-HP of their fermentation
broth was determined. According to the results (Figure 3), we found that supplying NADPH
to the system can significantly increase 3-HP production. The yields of Po1f-NC-01 and
Po1f-NC-02 fermentation broth reached 0.519 g·L−1 (DCW: 69.87 mg·g−1) and 0.566 g·L−1
(DCW: 72.83 mg·g−1), respectively. Therefore, GAPN from S. mutans is more suitable for
expression in Y. lipolytica. In order to achieve higher yields, we chose strain Po1f-NC-02 for
further modification. The map of plasmid p1312-NC-GAPNSm is shown in Figure S2.

Po1f-NC-11, Po1f-NC-12, Po1f-NC-13, and Po1f-NC-14. Three independent repeated experiments
were performed for each strain. Error bars represent standard deviations.

3.3. Increasing Flux to 3-HP Production through Overexpression of MCR Pathway Genes
As shown in Figure 1, we attempted to enhance the metabolic ﬂux from acetyl-CoA to
malonyl-CoA using the overexpressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 coding gene ACC1 from
Y. lipolytica, which was considered to have strong enzyme activity [20]. ACC1Yl , which was
ampliﬁed from the genome of Y. lipolytica, was connected between the hp4d promoter and
XPR2 terminator in plasmid pINA1269. The pINA1269 plasmid is helpful when studying
the effect of the gene copy number on 3-HP production, as it can strictly control the number
of copies of genes transformed into the genome. Plasmid p1269-ACC1 was transformed
into the strain Po1f-NC-02 and integrated into the genome, obtaining strain Po1f-NC-
03. Through quantitative HPLC analysis of the fermentation broth of strain Po1f-NC-03,
we found that the concentration of 3-HP increased to 0.684 g ·L−1 (DCW: 94.07 mg·g−1).
As shown, an additional copy of ACC1 can enhance the metabolic ﬂux, thereby increasing
3-HP production. We attempted to connect anotherACC1 gene expression cassette based on
p1269-ACC1, obtaining p1269-ACC1-ACC1. It was transformed into Po1f-NC-02, obtaining
Po1f-NC-04 to further promote metabolic ﬂux. Relative real-time quantitative analysis was
performed on strains Po1f, Po1f-NC-03 and Po1f-NC-04 to conﬁrm the effectiveness of gene
manipulation. The ACC1 relative expression level is shown in Figure S1A. The results in
Figure 3 show that the concentration of 3-HP in the fermentation broth of Po1f-NC-04 was
0.682 g·L−1 (DCW: 90.25 mg·g−1). The additional two copies did not lead to a higher 3-HP
yield. It is inferred that ACC1 is not the key limiting factor under this condition.
Meanwhile, the mutant ACSL641P gene from Salmonella enterica was overexpressed
to provide the system with more acetyl-CoA [ 39]. ACSL641P
Se was connected to plasmid
pINA1269 and transformed into strain Po1f-NC-02, obtaining Po1f-NC-06. The results
showed that the concentration of 3-HP in fermentation broth of Po1f-NC-07 reached
0.635 g·L−1 (DCW: 89.4 mg ·g−1). Therefore, the overexpression of ACSL641P
Se was effec-
tive in increasing 3-HP production. We attempted to connect another ACSL641P
Se gene
expression cassette based on p1269-ACS L641P
Se , obtaining p1269-ACS L641P
Se -ACSL641P
Se . It
was transformed into Po1f-NC-02, obtaining Po1f-NC-07. Relative real-time quantitative
analysis was performed on strains Po1f-NC-06 and Po1f-NC-07 to conﬁrm the expression
level of ACSL641P
Se enzyme. The ACSL641P
Se relative expression level is shown in Figure S1B.
The accumulation of 3-HP reached 0.622 g·L−1 (DCW: 78.16 mg·g−1), which is lower than
that of Po1f-NC-06. This indicates that two copies of ACSL641P
Se affected the efﬁciency of
gene expression, thereby having no effect on improving 3-HP production.
On this basis, we also explored the role of the overexpression of ALD6 in improving
3-HP production. ALD6Yl was ampliﬁed from the genome of Y. lipolytica and connected to
plasmid pINA1269, obtaining p1269-ALD6. Po1f-NC-05 was constructed by transforming
p1269-ALD6 into the genome on the base of Po1f-NC-02. The yield of 3-HP reached
0.566 g·L−1 (DCW: 73.77 mg·g−1). This indicate that the overexpression of ALD6Yl cannot
increase the metabolic ﬂux to acetate compared to Po1f-NC-02. It can be inferred that
Y. lipolytica does not proceed with aerobic alcohol fermentation, so the ﬂux naturally ﬂows
to acetate [40]. This is one of the reasons why Y. lipolytica is more suitable for synthesizing
3-HP than S. cerevisiae.
Therefore, we ﬁnally chose to connect anACC1Yl gene expression cassette andACSL641P
Se
gene expression cassette to plasmid pINA1269, obtaining p1269-ACC1-ACSL641P
Se . The map
of plasmid ACSL641P
Se is shown in Figure S3. The recombinant plasmid was transformed
into the genome of Po1f-NC-02 to obtain Po1f-NC-08. The concentration of 3-HP in the
fermentation broth of Po1f-NC-08 reached 0.745 g·L−1 (DCW: 95.72 mg·g−1), which was
improved by 1.32-fold compared to that of Po1f-NC-02.
3.4. Knockout of Bypass Genes of Malonyl-CoA Pathway to Glyoxylate Cycle
To further improve 3-HP production and reduce metabolic ﬂux to the bypass, we at-
tempted to knock out the malate synthase 1 coding gene MLS1 (YALI0D19140p) and citrate
synthase 2 coding gene CIT2 (YALI0E00638p), resulting in ﬂux in the glyoxylate cycle. The
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system is suitable for the continuous knockout of multiple genes.
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 12 of 19
We constructed plasmids JME4580-MLS1-sgRNA and JME4580-CIT2-sgRNA, which were
connected by the corresponding sgRNA sequence. Meanwhile, the plasmids donor-MLS1
and donor-CIT2 were constructed using a seamless connection method which can provide
donor fragments. Genes MLS1 and CIT2 were knocked out by the CRISPR/Cas9 system
based on Po1f-NC-08. After DNA electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing veriﬁcation, we
obtained MLS1 deletion transformant Po1f-NC-09 and CIT2 deletion transformant Po1f-
NC-10, with 3-HP yields of 0.818 g ·L−1 (DCW: 115.05 mg ·g−1) and 0.791 g ·L−1 (DCW:
111.4 mg·g−1), respectively. It is indicated that the deletion of the two genes can reduce
metabolic ﬂux to the glyoxylate cycle, thereby increasing 3-HP production, which is con-
sistent with the fermentation of 3-HP by S. cerevisiae [39]. Therefore, after culturing strain
Po1f-NC-09 for 24 h to complete CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid curing, we knocked out CIT2 on
the basis of the strain Po1f-NC-09, ﬁnally obtaining Po1f-NC-11. The concentration of 3-HP
reached 0.858 g·L−1 (DCW: 119.13 mg·g−1), an increase of 0.113 g·L−1 compared to that of
the strain Po1f-NC-08.
3.5. Knockout of 3-HP Degradation Related Genes in Malonate Semialdehyde Pathway
In order to further improve the concentration of 3-HP , we attempted to eliminate
other factors that reduce its production. According to the results of Figure 2D, we found
that the 3-HP yield of the strain Po1f-NC-00 decreased between 96 h and 120 h during
fermentation. Considering that the characteristics of 3-HP are relatively stable under
normal conditions, it is inferred that there is a 3-HP degradation pathway in Y. lipolytica.
By querying the schematic diagram of the propanoate metabolism of Y. lipolytica in the
KEGG database, the malonate semialdehyde pathway (M00013) from propanoyl-CoA to
acetyl-CoA was found. As shown in Figure 1B, the 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase
coding gene HPDH (YALI0F02607p) can degrade 3-HP to malonate semialdehyde, and
the methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase coding gene MMSDH (YALI0C01859p)
can degrade malonate semialdehyde to acetyl-CoA. Therefore, we attempted to knock out
HPDH based on strain Po1f-NC-11, obtaining strain Po1f-NC-12. The concentration of
3-HP reached 1.053 g·L−1 (DCW: 149.74 mg·g−1), indicating that the deletion of HPDH can
effectively alleviate 3-HP degradation. Since malonate semialdehyde is also an important
intermediate product for converting malonyl-CoA to 3-HP ,MMSDH was knocked out to
increase the concentration of malonate semialdehyde. Strain Po1f-NC-13 was obtained
by knocking out MMSDH based on the strain Po1f-NC-11. Its yield of 3-HP reached
0.952 g·L−1 (DCW: 132.24 mg·g−1). Therefore, preventing the degradation of malonate
semialdehyde is beneﬁcial for increasing the production of 3-HP . Finally, strain Po1f-NC-14
was obtained by knocking out MMSDH based on strain Po1f-NC-12. The concentration
of the fermentation broth was 1.128 g ·L−1 (DCW: 158.47 mg·g−1). To further verify the
effect of the knockout malonate semialdehyde degradation pathway, we compared the
concentration of 3-HP in the fermentation broth during 0–120 h of strains Po1f-NC-11
and Po1f-NC-14. It is shown in Figure 4A that as 3-HP synthesis began, knocking out
genes HPDH and MMSDH increased 3-HP production, largely solving the degradation
problem of 3-HP . Meanwhile, we knocked out genesHPDH and MMSDH based on the
initial recombinant strain Po1f-NC-00, and the modiﬁcation effect was consistent with that
in Figure 4B. All of the aforementioned genetic operations improved the 3-HP titer by
5.55-fold in the fermentation broth of strain Po1f-NC-14 compared to that of Po1f-tMCR.

3.6. Effect of Pyruvic Acid Addition
In addition to the modiﬁcation of genes related to the malonyl-CoA pathway, changes
in fermentation conditions can also increase 3-HP production. One option is the optimiza-
tion of the fermentation medium. According to Figure 1, we attempted to add pyruvic
acid, which was treated as an auxiliary carbon source for the medium under the premise of
no glucose being added. Meanwhile, adding pyruvate acid can also push the metabolic
ﬂux towards acetic acid, increasing the production of 3-HP [ 41]. To explore the optimal
concentration of pyruvate acid required to increase the yield of 3-HP , varying amounts
of 0 to 6 g ·L−1 pyruvate acid were added to the YPD medium, and their 3-HP produc-
tion was prepared after culturing with a shake ﬂask. As demonstrated by the results in
Figure 5A, adding 4 g·L−1 pyruvate acid favored the 3-HP production best; the 3-HP yield
of strain Po1f-NC-14 reached 1.373 g·L−1. Therefore, improving the yield of 3-HP can be
attempted by adding pyruvate acid to the initial YPD medium, although this will increase
the fermentation cost.

± SD of biological triplicates in (A–D). Statistical analysis was conducted as signiﬁcance indicated
by * p < 0.05.
3.7. Fermentation-Relevant Characteristics of 3-HP Synthesis by Y. lipolytica
The pH of fermentation medium also affects the 3-HP yield. The initial pH value
in this study was 6.0, and the previous experimental results were obtained under this
condition. In order to ﬁnd the optimal pH value and prepare for fermentation conditions
optimization and bioreactor fermentation, we adjusted the pH of the YPD medium to
5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0, and performed fermentation experiments using strain Po1f-NC-
00. The results shown in Figure 5B indicate that a pH of 6.0 is most suitable for the
accumulation of 3-HP under current conditions, which may also depend on the acidity of
the fermentation environment of Y. lipolytica; additionally, the strain was usually used to
synthesize organic acids. However, the results also indicate that a pH lower than 6.0 is not
beneﬁcial for the accumulation of 3-HP . Therefore, we will continue to choose pH 6.0 for
subsequent experiments.
The growth of initial strain Po1f and recombinant engineering strains should also be
investigated. The growth of yeast is closely related to the production of 3-HP . The OD600
values of the strains Po1f, Po1f-tMCR, Po1f-NC-00, Po1f-NC-07 and Po1f-NC-14 cultured
in YPD medium were determined at 0, 8, 14, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results in
Figure 5C indicate that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the growth of recombinant
engineering, which was slightly faster than that of initial strain Po1f. It can be inferred that
supplementing auxotroph markers to the genome ofY. lipolyticacontributes to yeast growth.
During shake ﬂask fermentation, there is a good linearity correlation between OD 600
and DCW.
On this basis, we explored the inhibitory effects of 3-HP on Y. lipolytica. Different
concentrations of the 3-HP standard sample, which included 0.1 g·L−1, 0.5 g·L−1, 1 g·L−1,
2 g·L−1 and 3 g·L−1, were separately added to the YPD medium, and we used strain Po1f to
perform fermentation experiments. The results in Figure 5D indicate that adding no more
than 1 g·L−1 of the 3-HP standard sample to the YPD medium cannot affect the growth
of strain Po1f. When the concentration of 3-HP added was greater than 2 g ·L−1, yeast
growth was affected. When the concentration of 3-HP added was greater than 3 g ·L−1,
the logarithmic growth phase of Y. lipolytica was delayed. In summary, it can be inferred
that the accumulation of 3-HP during shake ﬂask fermentation does not affect the normal
growth of Y. lipolytica based on the current concentration of 3-HP in the fermentation broth
of strain Po1f-NC-14.

3.8. Fed-Batch Fermentation of 3-HP on Strain Po1f-NC-14
In order to further validate the synthesis effect of recombinant strain Po1f-NC-14 on
3-HP and explore the yield potential of fermentation preliminary, we performed fed-batch
fermentation on strain Po1f-NC-14 in a 1 L bioreactor. The results in Figure 2D indicate that
the synthesis of 3-HP stopped as glucose was depleted. Therefore, the initial concentration
of glucose was raised to 50 g·L−1 to increase the production of 3-HP . Meanwhile, to avoid
affecting the synthesis of 3-HP , we replenished glucose to the bioreactor to reach the initial
concentration when the concentration of glucose was below 10 g·L−1. Suitable fermentation
conditions for production 3-HP were set as follows: pH, 6.0; air ﬂux, 1.5 vvm; and stirring
rate, 550 rpm. As shown in Figure 6, the accumulation of 3-HP reached 16.23 g·L−1 at 240 h,
which is the highest reported 3-HP yield in Y. lipolytica. The OD600 reached 170.2 at 216 h.
The phenomenon of the OD value decreasing in the last 12 h of fermentation indicates that
the strain began to die. At the same time, the concentration of 3-HP no longer increased
after 228 h, indicating that the accumulation of the product was restricted by the growth
of the strain and the fermentation conditions. The consumption rate of glucose gradually
slowed in the later stage of fermentation, verifying that the viable count decreased. The
optimization of fermentation conditions can further increase the expression level of relevant
genes. Therefore, we could attempt to optimize bioreactor fermentation conditions in the
future to pursue a higher yield.

4. Discussion
3-HP plays an important role in industrial chemical production. Chemical synthesis
methods have a series of disadvantages, including high cost, high pollutant emissions,
and complex steps, and utilizing microorganisms to synthesize 3-HP is environmentally
friendly. The increasing yield of the biosynthesis method is also advantageous. Prokary-
otic chassis cells, such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and eukaryotic chassis cells, such
as S. cerevisiae and P . pastoris, were used to produce 3-HP . E.coli, which was previously
used for research, as the chassis cell has the advantages of high yield and easy opera-
tion. However, when synthesizing 3-HP , it has poor tolerance, which is a disadvantage.
Y. lipolytica has a high tolerance for the production of organic acid products because its
fermentation environment is acidic. Compared to S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica also has more
metabolic ﬂux for synthesizing 3-HP . As malonyl-CoA is the precursor for the synthesis of
FFA [42], Y. lipolytica, a strain capable of synthesizing and storing large amounts of FFA,
has a signiﬁcant advantage in producing 3-HP . Therefore, we chose Y. lipolytica as the
chassis cell to synthesize 3-HP in this study.
As shown in Section 3.1, the initial malonyl-CoA pathway for synthesizing 3-HP was
constructed in Y. lipolytica. The yield of 3-HP reached 0.203 g·L−1, which is higher than that
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 16 of 19
of S. cerevisiae [17]. This also indicates that Y. lipolytica has a more abundant precursor than
S. cerevisiae. In order to further enhance enzyme activity, according to the literature, MCR
was split into two subunits: MCR-N and MCR-C. The yield of 3-HP reached 0.353 g·L−1.
The activity of MCR and replenishing of NADPH are the key to increasing the yield of
3-HP through the malonyl-CoA pathway [ 43]. Therefore, plasmid pINA1312 was used
to connect their coding genes to perform multiple copies into genome of Y. lipolytica by
NHEJ [44]. The results indicated that GAPNSm is more suitable for expression thanGAPNBc
as described in Section 3.2. On this basis, a series of genes was overexpressed to promote the
metabolic ﬂux to ﬂow towards malonyl-CoA. As shown in Section 3.3, one overexpressed
copy of ACC1Yl and ACSL641P
Se by plasmid pINA1269 can increase the yield of 3-HP to
0.745 g·L−1. The results showed that transforming another two copies of the two genes into
the genome of Y. lipolytica failed to improve the yield of 3-HP . It is inferred that the contents
of acetate and acetyl-CoA in the strain are not the key factor limiting 3-HP production at
this time. Likewise, the overexpression of the ALD6 gene cannot increase the production of
3-HP; this may be because Y. lipolytica is unable to perform aerobic alcohol fermentation,
and the main metabolic ﬂux automatically ﬂows to acetate. This is not consistent with the
situation in S. cerevisiae. In Section 3.4, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out
genes related to the glyoxylate cycle, includingMLS1 and CIT2. The yield of 3-HP increased
by 0.113 g·L−1, which is higher than that of S. cerevisiae. By focusing on the production of
3-HP in the later stage of fermentation, we noticed the degradation of 3-HP . After querying
the KEGG database, we discovered the presence of the malonate semialdehyde pathway,
which can degrade 3-HP in Y. lipolytica. In Section 3.5, the genes MMSDH and HPDH were
knocked out to alleviate the degradation of 3-HP and increase the content of precursor
for 3-HP synthesis. The yield of strain reached 1.128 g ·L−1, increasing by 0.269 g ·L−1,
and signiﬁcantly improved the production. Compared to the initial strain Po1f-tMCR,
the yield of 3-HP improved 5.55-fold. This yield is higher than that of the recombinant
S. cerevisiae strain achieved via shake ﬂask culturing [45]. In Sections 3.6 and 3.7, a series
of fermentation-level measures were implemented to increase the production of 3-HP .
Adding 4 g·L−1 pyruvic acid to the YPD medium can further increase the production of
3-HP because pyruvic acid is also another carbon source. In the background of shake
ﬂask fermentation culture, the medium with a pH value of 6.0 is more suitable for the
accumulation of 3-HP . OD600 is a reﬂection of the growth status of the strain. The results
showed that there is no signiﬁcant difference in the OD600 among different recombinant
strains. This situation is consistent with the growth of recombinant strains of Y. lipolytica,
which are used to produce other productions. To rule out the impact of 3-HP accumulation
on strain growth, we tested the tolerance of Y. lipolytica to 3-HP . The results showed that
the current 3-HP shake ﬂask fermentation yield does not impact the growth of Y. lipolytica.
Lastly, fed-batch fermentation was performed in a 1 L bioreactor to preliminarily verify
the ability of strain Po1f-NC-14 to synthesize 3-HP in Section 3.8. The accumulation
concentration of 3-HP in the fermentation broth of Po1f-NC-14 reached 16.23 g·L−1, which
is higher than that inE. coli [11] and is close to that of an unconventional yeastP . pastoris[20].
Through the fed-batch fermentation results, it can also be observed that the OD600 began
to decrease and the speed rate of glucose consumption gradually slowed. As a result,
the production of 3-HP no longer increased in the later stage of fermentation. It can be
inferred that the volume of bioreactor is an important factor which limits strain growth and
the yield of 3-HP .
Although we employed a series of measures to increase the production of 3-HP ,
there are still many new directions to explore. Constructing a super yeast chassis can
signiﬁcantly improve the metabolic ﬂux of precursor for synthesizing 3-HP , and related gene
manipulations can be applied in Y. lipolytica [42]. We will also perform gene manipulation
on malate dehydrogenase coding gene ( MDH) and focus on the ration of two forms
of MDH to further increase the yield of 3-HP . Attempting to apply differ expression
promoters [46], setting up a dynamic sensor–regulator system to control the expression
level of genes [47], and overexpressing relevant genes obtained from the results of RNA-
J. Fungi 2023, 9, 573 17 of 19
sequencing of recombinant strain [48] can increase 3-HP production at the genetic level.
At the same time, optimizing the fermentation conditions of fed-batch fermentation in the
bioreactor can also improve the accumulation of 3-HP . Overall, usingY. lipolyticato produce
and accumulate 3-HP has great potential for development.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we obtained the recombinant Y. lipolytica Po1f-NC-14 by overexpressed
genes MCR-NCa , MCR-CCa , GAPNSm, ACC1 and ACSL641P
Se , knocking out genes MLS1 and
CIT2, leading to the glyoxylate cycle, and knocking out 3-HP degradation-related genes
MMSDH and HPDH. The yield of 3-HP in shake ﬂask fermentation reached 1.128 g·L−1,
and the yield in a fed-batch fermentation in a 1 L bioreactor reached 16.23 g·L−1. We also
analyzed the impact of changing fermentation conditions on 3-HP production and the
tolerance of Y. lipolytica to the product. This study utilized Y. lipolytica to produce 3-HP ,
creating new directions of research and providing insights into the synthesis of organic
acid in unconventional yeast, which will provide a reference for future studies.
