Production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) inPichia pastoris(syn. Komagataella phafﬁi)
via the malonyl-CoA pathway has been recently demonstrated using glycerol as a carbon
source, but the reported metrics were not commercially relevant. Theﬂux through the
heterologous pathway from malonyl-CoA to 3-HP was hypothesized as the main
bottleneck. In the present study, different metabolic engineering approaches have
been combined to improve the productivity of the original 3-HP producing strains. To
do so, an additional copy of the gene encoding for the potential rate-limiting step of the
pathway, i.e., the C-terminal domain of the malonyl-CoA reductase, was introduced. In
addition, a variant of the endogenous acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACC1
S1132A) was
overexpressed with the aim to increase the delivery of malonyl-CoA. Furthermore, the
genes encoding for the pyruvate decarboxylase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA
synthase, respectively, were overexpressed to enhance conversion of pyruvate into
cytosolic acetyl-CoA, and the main gene responsible for the production of the by-
product D-arabitol was deleted. Three different screening conditions were used to
classify the performance of the different strains: 24-deep-well plates batch cultures,
small-scale cultures in falcon tubes using FeedBeads
® (i.e., slow release of glycerol
over time), and mini bioreactor batch cultures. The best two strains from the FeedBeads®
screening, PpHP8 and PpHP18, were tested in bioreactor fed-batch cultures using a pre-
ﬁxed exponentially increasing feeding rate. The strain PpHP18 produced up to 37.05 g L
−1
of 3-HP at 0.712 g L−1 h−1 with a ﬁnal product yield on glycerol of 0.194 Cmol−1 in fed-
batch cultures. Remarkably, PpHP18 did not rank among the 2-top producer strains in
small scale batch cultivations in deep-well plates and mini bioreactors, highlighting the
importance of multiplexed screening conditions for adequate assessment of metabolic
engineering strategies. These results represent a 50% increase in the product yield and
ﬁnal concentration, as well as over 30% increase in volumetric productivity compared to
the previously obtained metrics forP. pastoris. Overall, the combination of glycerol as
carbon source and a metabolically engineeredP. pastorisstrain resulted in the highest 3-
HP concentration and productivity reported so far in yeast.

INTRODUCTION
Microbial production of platform chemicals is an increasingly
attractive alternative to petrochemical-derived products. One
such chemical, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), is an organic
acid that can be chemically converted to acrylic acid, 1,3-
propanediol, and malonic acid, among others (d e l l aP i n ae ta l . ,
2011), offering a great potential for bioproduction of a wide
range of polymers. In fact, 3-HP has been included in the list of
the top platform chemicals that can be obtained from biomass
(Werpy and Petersen, 2004).
3-HP can be naturally produced by several bacteria through
different biosynthetic routes. Among them, the glycerol-
dependant pathway, and the pathways via malonyl-CoA and
β-alanine intermediates have been the most extensively
investigated ( Kumar et al., 2013 ; de Fouchécour et al.,
2018). Multiple microorganisms have been engineered to
produce 3-HP, including bacteria ( Jers et al., 2019 )a n d
yeast (Ji et al., 2018). The highest 3-HP concentrations and
productivities achieved so far have been obtained in
Escherichia coli [76.2 g L
−1 of 3-HP and 1.89 g L −1 h−1,
respectively ( Kim et al., 2020 )] and Klebsiella pneumoniae
(Zhao et al., 2019 ). Both bacterial species were engineered
to produce 3-HP through the glycerol-dependent pathway.
This facilitated the use of glycerol as a carbon source and,
ultimately, of crude glycerol, which is an abundant,
inexpensive and renewable feedstock produced as a main
by-product of the conventional biodiesel production
process. Morevover, glycerol is very attractive for
production of organic acids such as 3-HP due to its higher
degree of reduction compared to glucose.
Production of 3-HP in yeast has been mainly pursued by
introducing the malonyl-CoA or β-alanine pathways, e.g.,
reaching a titer of about 13.7 g L
−1 and with a 0.14 ± 0.0 C-
mol−1 yield on glucose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae fed-batch
cultures ( Borodina et al., 2015 ). The methylotrophic yeast
Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaf ﬁi) is able to grow
efﬁciently on glycerol. Furthermore, crude glycerol may
contain from 1% to 25% w/w methanol ( Luo et al., 2016),
making this feedstock ideal for a methylotrophic
microorganism such as P. pastoris. In addition, this yeast can
grow at a pH as low as 3 (Cregg et al., 1993; Werten et al., 1999),
which allows performing the fermentation process at a pH below
the pKa of 3-HP (4.51). This would enable the use ofin situ
product recovery systems, thereby avoiding 3-HP accumulation
to toxic levels and facilitating 3-HP export from cells (van Maris
et al., 2004). The 3-HP extraction yield using a membrane-
assisted in situ product recovery system was increased from
5% to 74% when the pH of the medium was decreased from
5 to 3.2 (Chemarin et al., 2019).

Fina et al. 3-HP Production inPichia pastoris
In a recent study, we addressed the use of P. pastoris to
produce 3-HP from glycerol (Fina et al., 2021). This yeast was
metabolically engineered to express the malonyl-CoA reductase
pathway, which consists of two consecutive steps reducing
malonyl-CoA into 3-HP, while consuming two NADPH
molecules ( Figure 1 ). Speci ﬁcally, we expressed the gene
encoding for the bi-functional enzyme malonyl-CoA reductase
(MCR) fromChloroﬂexus aurantiacus.This pathway provides the
simplest way to produce 3-HP from glycerol inP. pastoris, as the
glycerol-dependant pathway is coenzyme B12-dependant. Since
P. pastoris does not naturally produce coenzyme B-12, the
introduction of the glycerol-dependant pathway for 3-HP
biosynthesis pathway in this cell factory would require either
the addition of such expensive cofactor to the fermentation
medium or the co-expression of the multistep B-12
biosynthetic pathway (Fang et al., 2018).
In addition, several improvements were made to the original
strain. First, the independent expression of the two MCR subunits
was implemented, leading to a 12.5-fold increase in 3-HP
production. Second, the resulting strain was further engineered
to increase the availability of NADPH and malonyl-CoA, which
are the two substrates of this route. To this end, the acetyl-CoA
carboxylase gene fromYarrowia lipolytica(ACC1
Yl) and a NADH
kinase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae(cPOS5Sc) were expressed in
the cytosol. However, this strategy resulted in rather modest
improvements in terms of product yield, pointing to the delivery
of malonyl-CoA as a major bottleneck to further improve 3-HP
production. Notably, this strain produced up to 24.75 g L
−1 of 3-
HP in 45.5 h in a fed-batch culture using glycerol as a carbon
source, which is, to our knowledge, the highest productivity
reported so far in yeast (0.54 g L
−1 h−1)( Fina et al., 2021).
Despite providing theﬁrst demonstration of the potential ofP.
pastoris for 3-HP production from glycerol, 3-HP production
metrics from our previous study are still far from being
industrially-relevant, as a minimum productivity of
2.5 g L−1 h−1, 50~100 g L−1 and >0.5 g/g yield are generally
required to achieve an economically feasible bioprocess for
carboxylic acid production ( Werpy and Petersen, 2004 ;
Mazzoli, 2021).
Here, further metabolic engineering of the previously
developed 3-HP-producing strains ( Fina et al., 2021 ) was
performed to increase the production metrics. In particular,
we aimed at improving both the biosynthetic pathway for 3-
HP from its metabolic precursor (acetyl-CoA), as well as
improving the metabolic ﬂux towards acetyl-CoA synthesis
and reducing by-product (arabitol) formation. Notably, we
used three different small-scale cultivation systems for better
characterisation of the impact of genetic modiﬁcations on cell
growth and product yields and subsequent transfer to bioreactor-
scale cultivations.

et al., 2019). The integration loci are also indicated in the
Supplementary Material S1 . The integrity of the inserted
cassette was veriﬁed by Sanger sequencing at the Genomics
and Bioinformatics Service of the Universitat Autònoma de
Barcelona.
Copy Number Determination by Droplet
Digital PCR
The number of copies of the gene mcr-CCa of the highest
producing clones of the strains PpHP7 and PpHP8 was tested
with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) following a previously reported
method ( Cámara et al., 2016 ), except that the QX200
TM
ddPCRTM EvaGreen Supermix (Biorad, CA, United States) was
used instead of Taqman probes. First, the genomic DNA of the
highest producing clones was puri ﬁed using the Wizard ®
Genomic DNA Puri ﬁcation Kit from Promega (WI,
United States). Afterwards, 0.5 µg of genomic DNA were
restricted using the restriction enzymes BamHI-FD and
EcoRI-FD from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (MA, United States).
Subsequently, the genomic DNA was diluted to a concentration
of 1 ngμL
−1.
Second, a master mix of 22.5 µL was prepared with the forward
primer at 0.4 µM, the reverse primer at 0.2 µM, and the restricted
genomic DNA at 0.08 ngμL
−1. Afterwards, the master mix was
mixed with 22.5 µL of EvaGreen 2X master solution and was
thoroughly mixed by vortexing. Following droplet generation
using a Droplet generator (Biorad, CA, United States), the
droplets were transferred to a 96-tubes rack and subsequently
sealed with a PCR Plate Heat Seal. The PCR was carried using a
C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Biorad, CA, United States). The
annealing temperature was set to 60
°C. Finally, the ddPCR results
were analysed using a QX200 Droplet Digital PCR system
(Biorad, CA, United States).
The primers used for ddPCR are listed inTable 2. The primer
pairs ddPCR_mcrCCa_FW and ddPCR_mcrCCa_RV (Table 2)
were used to amplify themcr-C
Ca gene. Primers ddPCR_act_FW
and ddPCR_act_RV were used to amplify theβ-actin (ACT1)
endogenous gene, which was used as reference of a single-
copy gene.
24-Deep-Well Plates Screening
P. pastoris strains were inoculated into 50 mL falcon tubes
containing 5 mL of YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and
1% v/v glycerol) supplemented with 100 μgm L
−1 zeocin
(InvivoGen, CA, United States). The cells were grown
overnight at 30 °C and 200 rpm in an incubator shaker
Multitron Standard (Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland) with
a 2.5 cm orbit. 50μL of overnight-grown cultures were used to
inoculate each well of a 24 deep-well plate containing 2 mL of
Buffered Minimal Glycerol (BMG) medium, containing 100 mM
potassium phosphate buffer pH 6, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base
(YNB), 1% v/v glycerol, and 0.4 mg L
−1 biotin. The cultures were
incubated at 28°C and 220 rpm in the same incubator shaker
using a platform with a slope of 20° to improve the aeration. The
cultures were grown for 48 h to ensure the full consumption of the
substrate. Thereafter, culture samples were centrifuged at
12,000 g for 5 min andﬁltered through a 0.20 µm pore size
syringe ﬁlter (SLLGX13NK, Merck Millipore, CA,
United States). The 3-HP was quantiﬁed using HPLC.
The parental clones PpHP2 and PpHP6 were screened in
triplicates. Six to eight clones were screened in triplicates for the
strains generated by single-homology integration (PpHP7,
PpHP8, and PpHP9). One single clone was screened in
triplicates for the strains generated using CRISPR-Cas9.
Small-Scale Screening in Falcon Tubes
Using FeedBeads®
The inoculum was prepared following the same protocol
described for the deep-well plates screenings. Afterwards, 50-
mL falcon tubes wereﬁlled with 5 mL of Buffer Minimal medium
(BM; 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6, 1.34% YNB and
0.4 mg L
−1 biotin), supplemented with one Glycerol FeedBeads®
(SMFB12001, Kuhner Shaker GmbH, Germany). This FeedBead®
releases 40 mg of glycerol in 48 h. The cultures were inoculated
with 50 µL of the overnight saturated cultures. The falcon tubes
were incubated in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm and 30
°C for
48 h. Each clone was tested in triplicate. A triplicate control was
performed by adding one FeedBead
®to a falcon with 5 mL of BM
medium. These controls were used to determine the actual release
of glycerol under the tested conditions.
Culture samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min and
ﬁltered through a 0.20 µm pore size syringeﬁlter (SLLGX13NK,
Merck Millipore). The 3-HP was quanti ﬁed using HPLC as
described below.
Mini Bioreactors Screening
The automated cultivation and sampling platform described
elsewhere was used (Heux et al., 2014).
The bioreactor medium contained 2.5 g L
−1 glycerol, 1.8 g L−1
citric acid, 0.02 g L−1 CaCl2 · 2H 2O, 12.6 g L−1 (NH4)2HPO4,
0.5 g L−1 MgSO4 · 7H 2O, 0.9 g L−1 KCl, 50μL antifoam Glanapon
2000 kz (Bussetti and Co., GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 0.4 mg L−1
biotin and 4.6 mL L−1 of PTM1 trace salts (Maurer et al., 2006).
The pH was set to 5 using 1 M HCl. The medium was autoclaved
without the trace salts and the biotin, which wereﬁlter sterilized
and added to the medium under sterile conditions. Each mini
bioreactor was ﬁlled with 15 mL of medium. The pre-inoculum
was prepared as described for the other two screening methods
(deep-well plates and falcon tubes with FeedBeads
®). The
overnight-saturated cultures were used to inoculate 250 mL
shake ﬂasks with 25 mL of YPG at a starting OD
600 of 0.5– 1.5.

Fina et al. 3-HP Production inPichia pastoris
The cells were grown for 8 h at 28°C and 160 rpm in a shaker
incubator to ensure the cells were at the exponential phase. Each
bioreactor was inoculated at a starting OD
600 of 0.025. Each strain
was tested in triplicate.
The temperature of the bioreactors was set to 28 °C. The
dissolved oxygen (DO) and the pH were monitored
throughout the cell culture. Samples were automatically
withdrawn from the bioreactors every 2 h for theﬁrst 16 h of
culture to monitor the OD
600. After 16 h, samples were
withdrawn hourly during 8 h for both OD600 monitoring and
supernatant analysis. The 250 µL samples for culture supernatant
analysis were automatically placed on 96-well plates with a
0.45 µm pore sizeﬁlter bottom. The samples were ﬁltered by
applying vacuum. Glycerol, 3-HP, and D-arabitol were quantiﬁed
using NMR as described below.
The growth rate (µ
max), the speciﬁc substrate consumption
rate (qSGlyc), and the speciﬁc 3-HP and D-arabitol production
rates (qP3HP and qPAbt) were calculated during the exponential
growth phase using the R program PhysioFit (Peiro et al., 2019).
Fed-Batch Cultures in Bioreactors
The cultures were carried out using a DASGIP Parallel Bioreactor
System (Eppendorf, Germany). The starting volume of each 1.3 L
reactor vessel was 400 mL. The Batch Medium described for the
mini bioreactors with 40 g L
−1 of glycerol was used. All the
medium components except the biotin and the trace salts were
mixed, placed into the reactor, and autoclaved. Biotin and trace
salts were added through the septum port after autoclaving the
reactor. The pH was controlled at 5 using 15% ammonia (only
base addition was used). Aeration was set to 1 vvm (0.4 L min
−1).
The DO was set to 30%, and it was automatically controlled using
the following cascade: 1) Increasing the stirring rate from 400 to
1,200 rpm; 2) Compressed air was mixed with pure oxygen to
increase the percentage of oxygen of the inlet gas. The reactors
were inoculated at a starting OD
600 of 1. The inocula
were prepared as described elsewhere (Garcia-Ortega et al., 2013).
The feeding medium composition was 400 g L−1 glycerol,
10 g L−1 KCl, 6.45 g L−1 MgSO4 · 7H 2O, 0.35 g L−1 CaCl2 ·
2H 2O, 0.2 mL L−1 antifoam Glanapon 2,000 kz, 1.2 mg L−1
biotin and 15 mL L−1 PTM1 trace salts. All the feeding
medium components except the biotin and the trace salts were
mixed and autoclaved. Biotin and trace salts wereﬁlter-sterilized
and added to the feeding medium under sterile conditions.
Feeding medium was added to the bioreactor using the
exponentially increasing feed-rate described by Eq. 1, where
F(t) is the feeding rate at every time, t
0 is the time where the
feeding starts (end of the batch phase), X (t0) is the biomass
concentration at the end of the batch phase, V (t0) is the starting
volume of the reactor (the volume for the batch phase),YX/S is the
biomass to substrate yield, and S0 is the concentration of substrate
in the feeding medium.Eq. 1 was simpliﬁed by assumingYX/S
would not vary signiﬁcantly between the batch and the fed-batch
phase (Eq. 2). InEq. 2,S batch is the concentration of substrate for
the batch medium (40 g L−1).

The feeding started once the DO increased above 60%,
indicating that all the substrate of the batch phase had been
consumed. Samples were collected for biomass cell dry
weight (CDW) determination and supernatant analysis.
The CDW was quanti ﬁed in triplicates. From 0.5 to 2 mL
of culture were ﬁltered through pre-weighted glass
micro ﬁber ﬁlters (APFF04700, Merck Millipore). The
ﬁlters were then washed with 10 mL of distilled water with
9gL
−1 NaCl and dried overnight at 105 °C. The ﬁlters
containing the dry biomass were weighted to calculate
the CDW.
Culture samples were centrifuged 5 min at 12,000 g and the
supernatant was ﬁltered with a 0.2 µm pore size syringeﬁlter
(SLLGX13NK, Merck Millipore). The ﬁltered supernatant was
analysed with HPLC for glycerol, 3-HP, and D-arabitol
quantiﬁcation.
HPLC Analysis
HPLC was used to quantify the glycerol, the D-arabitol, and
the 3-HP from the supernatant of the deep-well plates, the
FeedBeads
® screening, and the fed-batch bioreactor samples.
A previously described HPLC protocol was used (Fina et al.,
2021). The 3-HP was quanti ﬁed from the UV spectrum.
Glycerol and D-arabitol were quanti ﬁed from the Refractive
Index (RI) spectrum. As 3-HP and glycerol have the same
retention time and 3-HP is also detected on the RI detector, the
area corresponding to the 3-HP (previously quanti ﬁed from
the UV signal) was subtracted to latter calculate the actual
glycerol concentration.
NMR Analysis
Glycerol, D-arabitol, and 3-HP were quanti ﬁed from the
culture supernatants of the mini bioreactor cultures using
1D-1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) on a Bruker
Advance III 800 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin,
Germany). Prior to the analyses, 180 µL of ﬁltered culture
supernatant samples were mixed with 20 µL of 10 mM TSP (3-
(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3-
2H4]-propionic acid sodium salt),
which was used as an internal standard. The NMR
spectrometer was coupled to a 5 mm CQPI cryoprobe,
which was set to 280 K. A 30
° presaturation pulse was
recorded, followed by a relaxation delay of 7 s. The software
TopSpin 3.6.4 (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) was used for the
integration of the peaks.

Fina et al. 3-HP Production inPichia pastoris
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Increasing mcr-CCa Copy Number Leads to
Higher 3-HP Production
Previous results showed that the co-overexpression of ACC1
and cPOS5 in the initial 3HP-producing strain PpHP2
(Table 1) led to a small but signiﬁcant increase in the 3-HP
yield on glycerol in strain PpHP6 (from 0.131 Cmol Cmol−1 to
0.146 Cmol Cmol−1)( Fina et al., 2021 ). However, the
overexpression of either ACC or cPOS5 did not result into
any further signi ﬁcant impact on 3-HP production,
highlighting the malonyl-CoA reductase step as a major
bottleneck for 3-HP production, rather than the supply of
malonyl-CoA and NADPH availability.
Thereby, a second copy of the C-terminal domain of the
malonyl-CoA reductase gene (mcr-C
Ca) under the control of
the strong and constitutive GAP promoter was added to the
PpHP2 and PpHP6 strains, generating strains PpHP7 and
PpHP8, respectively. For each strain, six independently
isolated clones were tested in triplicate using deep-well
plates and BMG medium. The highest producer clone for
strains PpHP7 and PpHP8 produced 1.81 ± 0.02 g L
−1 and
2.29 ± 0.01 g L−1 of 3-HP (i.e., 0.143 ± 0.001 and 0.180 ±
0.001 Cmol−1 yield on glycerol, respectively). The gene copy
analysis showed that both clones contained 2 copies of mcr-
CCa. The 3-HP yield achieved by the strains PpHP2 and
PpHP6 was 0.130 ± 0.005 and 0.146 ± 0.004 Cmol −1,
respectively. Therefore, the addition of a second copy of

shown in Figure 2.
These results are consistent with previous studies with other
yeasts such asS. cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe .T h e
use of a multicopy integrative vector containing themcrCa and
the ACC1 gene from S. cerevisiae led to a 3-fold increase in 3-
HP production in S. cerevisiae (Kildegaard et al., 2016). In S.
pombe, the addition of a second copy of mcr-CCa led to an
almost 3-fold improvement in the 3-HP yield. Addition of a
third copy ofmcr-C

HP production, while the addition of a fourth copy of the
same gene, or the addition of a second copy mcr-NCa did
not have an impact on theﬁnal 3-HP titre (Takayama et al.,
2018).
Nevertheless, the increase in 3-HP production achieved
in P. pastoris when additional copies of the mcr-C Ca gene
were introduced was signi ﬁcantly lower than the one
achieved in other yeasts. Notably, the MCR speci ﬁc
activity of cell extracts of P. pastoris expressing mcrCa
under the control of pGAP was more than one order of

control of pTEF1 in S. cerevisiae (Chen et al., 2014 ; Fina
et al., 2021 ). Additional bottleneck(s) upstream of the
malonyl-CoA reductase reaction steps are probably
limiting the 3-HP production, so no further copies of
mcr-C
Ca were introduced.
Expression of the de-regulatedACC1S1132A
Mutant Does Not Improve 3-HP Production
The acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) catalyses the conversion of
acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA. The enzyme Acc1S1132A from P.
pastoris contains a site mutation (S1132A) that prevents the
post-translational inactivation of the enzyme by
phosphorylation when glucose is depleted ( Choi and da
Silva, 2014 ). Expression of this endogenous ACC1 variant
under the control of the GAP promoter showed a positive
impact on the production of acetyl-CoA derived drugs in P.
pastoris (Liu et al., 2019). The same approach was used in
PpHP7, but the new strain (PpHP9) produced less 3-HP than
the parental strain (0.138 ± 0.001 Cmol
−1, Figure 2).

Fina et al. 3-HP Production inPichia pastoris
Acc1 is organized as a homodimer. The phosphorylation of
one of the two monomers inactivates the enzymatic complex
(Hunkeler et al., 2016). Therefore, it is plausible that the co-
existence of the heterologous mutated version of Acc1 and the
endogenous non-mutated versions leads to the formation of
inactive heterodimers, hindering the effect of Acc1
S1132A
overexpression. This hypothesis is supported by previous
studies showing that replacement of the endogenous ACC1
sequence with ACC1
S1132A was required to ensure that Acc1
actvity would only be controlled by Acc1S1132A expression levels
(Wen et al., 2020). Deletion of the endogenousACC1 gene in
strains PpHP9 may thus had a positive effect on 3-HP
production. Moreover, it is well reported that Acc1 is a highly
regulated enzyme (Hunkeler et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018). In
addition to its post-translational regulation, this enzyme is also
regulated by allosteric inhibition (Goodridge, 1972; Qiao et al.,
2015). Differences in the kinetic parameters between the two
Acc1 variants might also explain the differences in theﬁnal 3-HP
yield.
In contrast, the overexpression ofACC1 from Y. lipolyticain P.
pastoris led to a small increase in 3-HP production (Fina et al.,
2021). The yield in PpHP8 (harboring Acc1
Yl) was around 1.25-
fold higher than in PpHP7. These results are consistent with
recent studies where the heterologous expression ofACC1 from
Y. lipolyticayielded a higher accumulation of malonyl-CoA than
the overexpression of the endogenousS. cerevisiae ACC1(Pereira
et al., 2022).
Metabolic Engineering for Increased
Acetyl-CoA Supply and Minimization of By-
Product Formation
The endogenous cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis pathway was
overexpressed to pull the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.
To this end, a modiﬁed Acetyl-CoA synthase fromSalmonella
enterica was used (acs
Se
L641P). The gene harbours a mutation
(L641P) to suppress the post-translational inhibition of the
enzyme by acetylation ( Shiba et al., 2007 ). Expression of
acsSe
L641P was tested with or without the co-expression of the
aldehyde dehydrogenase geneALD6 from S. cerevisiae. The two
genes were expressed under the control of the TEF1 and
MDH3 promoters, respectively, which are two mid-to-high
expression constitutive promoters (Prielhofer et al., 2017). Use
of pGAP was dismissed to avoid the dilution of the expression of
the other genes, as there are already 5 heterologous genes under
the control of pGAP (Marx et al., 2009; Aw and Polizzi, 2013).
Expression ofacs
Se in strains PpHP7 and PpHP8, generating
strains PpHP11 and PpHP13, led to opposite effects. While
PpHP11 produced signi ﬁcantly more 3-HP (0.153 ±
0.002 Cmol−1 yield) than PpHP7 ( p-value of 0.0003), its
expression in PpHP13 led to a reduction of the yield (p-value
0.0006), as shown inFigure 2.
The expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenaseALD6 in both
PpHP11 and PpHP13 (PpHP12 and PpHP14, respectively) led to
a decrease in the 3-HP yield for both strains ( Figure 2).
Interestingly, the deletion of ALD6 in S. cerevisiae led to a
reduced susceptibility to 3-HP, as Ald6 might catalyse the
conversion of 3-HP into the toxic compound 3-
hydroxypropanaldehyde (3-HPA) ( Kildegaard et al., 2014 ).
Thus, it is plausible that ALD6 overexpression in 3-HP
producing P. pastoris strains leads to an increased
accumulation of 3-HPA.
Finally, the overexpression of endogenous pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC1) was tested. To this end, an additional
copy ofPDC1 under the control of its endogenous promoter was
added to the genomes of the strains PpHP8 and PpHP13.
Addition of a second copy of PDC1 was coupled to the
deletion of the ArDH gene, which is reported as the main
responsible of the D-arabitol production in P. pastoris (Melo
et al., 2020). To distinguish the effect of the deletion ofArDH
from the overexpression of PDC1, strains PpHP15 and
PpHP17 were generated by deleting ArDH from strains
PpHP8 and PpHP13, respectively (without an additional
copy of PDC1) .T h es t r a i n sP p H P 1 6a n dP p H P 1 8w e r ea l s o
obtained from PpHP8 and PpHP13, and they harbour both the
deletion of ArDH and a second copy of the endogenousPDC1.
None of the new strains produced more 3-HP than their
parental strains (Figure 2).
Screening Under Substrate-Limiting
Conditions Yields Different Ranking of
Strains Compared to Conventional
Substrate-Excess Screening Strategies
Previous results obtained in deep-well plates showed that the
overexpression of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA production pathway
did not result in a signi ﬁcant increase in the ﬁnal 3-HP
production. Moreover, accumulation of D-arabitol was not
observed in none of the strains, as was the case for
PpHP6 strain in fed-batch cultivations ( Fina et al., 2021 ).
Thus, the effect of ArDH deletion could not be properly
assessed at small scale. Therefore, a representative subset of
the strains constructed in this study were further cultured in
two additional systems: 1) Mini bioreactors, favouring fully
aerobic conditions and easy withdrawal of multiple samples. 2)
Falcon tubes containing FeedBeads
®, which release glycerol at a
low and constant rate (40 mg in 48 h), thereby permitting cell
growth at a low rate, i.e., under substrate-limiting conditions
resembling a fed-batch process.
The mini bioreactors were sampled during the exponential
phase, which allowed to accurately determine the µ
max and the
q-rates of the consumption of glycerol and the production of 3-
HP and D-arabitol of the different strains, whereas endpoint
samples (at 48 h) were taken from cultivations in falcon tubes
containing FeedBeads
®.
Notably, comparison of the results from these alternative
screening conditions with the deep-well plate cultivations
(Figure 3) reveals that the ranking of the strains based on
their product yield varies depending on the screening
condition. PpHP8 exhibited the highest product yield for the
three screening conditions. However, the combined effect of ACS
and Pdc1 overexpression and ArDH deletion (strain PpHP18)
was clearly growth condition dependent. Indeed, the 3-HP
production of the two strains, PpHP8 and PpHP18 was very
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9423047
Fina et al. 3-HP Production inPichia pastoris
similar at a low growth rate (i.e., using FeedBeads®), but differed
signiﬁcantly at µmax (i.e., in the mini bioreactor experiment).
Interestingly, 3-HP yields were generally higher in deep-well
plates and falcon tubes, where oxygen transfer is usually
considered as rate-limiting during cultivation, than in fully
aerobic mini bioreactor cultures. This is consistent with the
fact that the pGAP promoter is upregulated inP. pastoris cells
growing on glucose under hypoxic conditions (Baumann et al.,
2011).
Moreover, strains PpHP13, PpHP15, PpHP17, and
PpHP18 showed a much lower 3-HP product yield than
PpHP8 when the cells were grown in mini bioreactors.
Conversely, the µ
max of strain PpHP8 was the lowest of this
subset of stains. An inverse correlation between µmax and 3-HP
product yield was observed. Despite lower growth rates would be
generally expected for the strains with a larger number of
heterologously overexpressed genes, overexpression of ACS and
Pdc1 and the deletion of ArDH led to a higher µ
max.
Acc1 overexpression has been reported to cause growth
impairment in yeast (Shi et al., 2014; Kildegaard et al., 2016).
This reduction in the growth rate was attributed to a metabolic
burden. The fact the cell growth improves when the cytosolic acetyl-
CoA pathway is overexpressed suggests that the lower growth rate of
PpHP8 might be caused by a limitation in acetyl-CoA supply for the
biosynthetic reactions. Such hypothesis is supported by the fact that
the product yield of strains PpHP8 and PpHP18 are almost identical
when the cells are grown at a low growth rate (i.e., using
FeedBeads
®). This is also reinforced by the differential D-arabitol
production of strains PpHP8 and PpHP13. The presence of arabitol
denotes a redox imbalance (Fina et al., 2021). When the delivery of
acetyl-CoA is improved by overexpressing ACS (PpHP13), the
D-arabitol production decreases.
Notably, the mini bioreactors data reveals that the deletion of
ArDH from strain PpHP8 (strain PpHP15) resulted in a
decrease in the D-arabitol yield and an improvement of the
µ
max. Production of D-arabitol from glycerol results in net ATP
consumption. Thus, the reduction in the D-arabitol production
leads to higher energetic yield from the substrate, as well as a
better carbon conservation (as less by-product D-arabitol is
produced), thereby potentially increasing acetyl-CoA supply
and supporting higher growth rates. However, this
might result in reduced Acetyl-CoA availability for 3-HP
production.
Altogether, the observed results indicate the supply of
cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a major limiting factor to further
increase the 3-HP yield.
Fed-Batch Cultures
The use of FeedBeads® mimics the conditions at a fed-batch
culture, where cells grow under substrate-limiting conditions,

PpHP18, which showed the highest 3-HP yields in FeedBeads®
cultures, were thus further tested in a fed-batch
bioreactor culture using a pre-programmed exponential
glycerol feeding strategy to maintain the growth rate at
0.075 h
−1, which is approximately half the value of the µmax
of the two strains (0.133 h−1 and 0.165 h−1, respectively). The
feeding phase ﬁnished when the equivalent to 195 g L−1 of
glycerol were added to the reactor, to compare the results with
our previous experiments where the same overall amount of
substrate was used ( Fina et al., 2021 ). Thereafter, the
cultivation was ﬁnalised when the DO signal increased,
indicating the depletion of any residual glycerol that might
have been accumulated during the late phase of the fed-batch
culture. The cultivation proﬁles for both strains are shown in
Figure 4.
At the end of the batch phase, PpHP8 produced 4.92 ±
0.17 g L
−1 3-HP, while the strain PpHP18 produced 4.11 ±
0.17 g L−1 3-HP. These results agree with the observations from
the mini bioreactors, where the yield of PpHP8 was higher than
the yield of PpHP18. However, 3-HP concentration at the end
of the fed-batch culture of PpHP18 reached 37.05 ± 0.73 g L
−1,
while the PpHP8 strain reached 35.40 ± 1.85 g L−1.T h u s ,t h e
yield during the feeding phase was higher for PpHP18 than
PpHP8. Moreover, the fact PpHP18 µ
max is higher than the one
of PpHP8 resulted in a shorter batch phase (22 h compared to
24 h). Previous studies revealed that P. pastoris cannot
sustain the growth rate in fed-batch cultivations at a pre-set
µo f0 . 1 0 h
−1 when 3-HP concentrations reached
concentrations above 15 g L−1, leading to the accumulation
of glycerol and D-arabitol in the reactor medium (Fina et al.,
2021). This phenomenon is still observed in
PpHP8 strain growing at 0.075 h −1,w h e r e1 7 . 4 1 g L−1 of
glycerol and 6.01 g L−1 of D-arabitol accumulated into the
reactor, while no glycerol nor D-arabitol accumulation were
observed for PpHP18. For this reason, the
PpHP18 cultivation was ﬁnalised just after stopping the
a d d i t i o no ft h ef e e d i n g .O v e r a l l ,t h ef e d - b a t c hf o r
PpHP18 lasted 52 h, while the fed-batch of PpHP8 lasted
56.5 h. Thus, the volumetric productivity of PpHP18 was
signiﬁcantly higher than the volumetric productivity of
PpHP8 (0.712 ± 0.010 g L
−1 h−1 compared to 0.627 ±
0.033 g L−1 h−1). The overall product yield on glycerol was
0.194 ± 0.004 Cmol−1 for PpHP18 and 0.186 ± 0.010 Cmol−1
for PpHP8.
The productivity obtained for the strain PpHP18 is the highest
productivity reported in yeast, and, to our knowledge, it is also the
highest productivity reported using the malonyl-CoA pathway to
produce 3-HP in any microorganism. Furthermore, 37.05 g L
−1 is
the highest 3-HP concentration reported in yeast, highlighting
the potential of the combined use of theP. pastoriscell factory and
glycerol as feedstock for 3-HP production. Notably, the
metabolically engineered PpHP18 strain showed a 50%
increase in theﬁnal 3-HP titre and yield, and a 31.9% increase
in volumetric productivity compared to the initial strain
(PpHP6).
CONCLUSION
Production of 3-HP in P. pastoris through the malonyl-CoA
reductase has been reported. The aim of this work was to improve
its production by several metabolic engineering strategies.
Improvement of the 3HP yield was obtained by adding a
second copy of mcr-C
Ca . However, 1) increasing the
availability of malonyl-CoA by overexpressing a post-
translationally unregulated Acc1 from P. pastoris; 2)
overexpressing endogenous acetyl-CoA pathway (ACS, Ald6,
and Pdc1) or 3) limiting the production of arabitol by deleting
ArDH did not improve 3-HP production in small-scale cultures.
Nevertheless, deletion ofArDH improved the 3-HP production in
fed-batch bioreactor cultures.
The work of this study demonstrates that the system and the
mode of cultivation clearly affected the phenotype of the
strains. For instance, the strain PpHP18 showed the
highest production of 3-HP in fed-batch cultivation mode
but not in deep-well plates and mini bioreactors operated in
batch. This provides clear evidence on the importance to
implement robust and reliable small-scale cultivation
methods allowing for the mid/high throughput
characterisation of strain performance under bioprocess-like
conditions. However, the results obtained with the
FeedBeads
® were similar to the ones obtained in fed-bath
cultures, thereby validating this methodology as a reliable

method for strain screening/ranking and fast translation to
bioreactor-scale.
Overall, our study showed that the multiplexed screening
methodologies allowed to improve the information content,
thereby supporting the formulation of hypotheses of
previously unidentiﬁed metabolic bottlenecks such as that the
supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA may be limiting 3-HP production.
Nonetheless, further studies, e.g., using
13C-based metabolicﬂux
analysis and metabolomics are needed to design novel metabolic
engineering strategies.
