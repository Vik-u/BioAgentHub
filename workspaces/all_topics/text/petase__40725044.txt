Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pollution represents a significant environmental chal-
lenge due to its widespread use and recalcitrant nature. PET-degrading enzymes, par-
ticularly Ideonella sakaiensis PETases (IsPETase), have emerged as promising biocatalysts
for mitigating this problem. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent
advancements in the discovery and heterologous expression ofIsPETase and closely related
enzymes. We highlight innovative approaches, such as in silico and AI-based enzyme
screening and advanced screening assays. Strategies to enhance enzyme secretion and
solubility, such as using signal peptides, fusion tags, chaperone co-expression, cell surface
display systems, and membrane permeability modulation, are critically evaluated. Despite
considerable progress, challenges remain in achieving industrial-scale production and
application. Future research must focus on integrating cutting-edge molecular biology tech-
niques with host-specific optimisation to achieve sustainable and cost-effective solutions
for PET biodegradation and recycling. This review aims to provide a foundation for further
exploration and innovation in the field of enzymatic plastic degradation.

1. Introduction
One of the greatest innovations of the 20th century, plastics have become indispensable
to human existence because of their advantageous qualities. Since 2000, global plastic
production has doubled from approximately 200 million tonnes (Mt) to ~400 Mt in 2019 [1].
Unfortunately, because plastics are not biodegradable, plastic trash builds up in landfills
and the ocean, which causes major environmental issues [2].
On a global scale, the recycling rate for plastic garbage stands at a modest 18%, with
a slightly higher proportion of 24% being submitted to burning. The other 58% of plastic
waste is either deposited in landfills or released into the natural environment, resulting in
the long-term buildup and persistence of plastics [ 3]. Plastics can be classified into two
distinct groups: biodegradable plastics, which can come from either natural or synthetic
sources and possess the ability to decompose through the action of microorganisms, and
nondegradable plastics, which are derived from petrochemicals and exhibit a higher molec-
ular weight due to the repetitive arrangement of small monomer units, commonly known
as synthetic polymers. Illustrations of the latter classification include polyethylene (PE),

polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), and other plastics [4].
1.1. PET
With an annual output of around 50 Mt, PET has become one of the most used synthetic
polymers since its invention in the 1940s and has emerged as an important contributor to
the growing problem of plastic waste. The primary cause of its propensity for degradation
is largely attributed to the existence of hydrolysable ester linkages in its composition [5].
Physical and chemical approaches have been implemented to degrade plastic waste,
such as ultraviolet (UV) treatment, physical stress, hydrolysis, and ammonolysis [6]. How-
ever, these approaches all have some limitations. For example, physical treatments degrade
plastics into smaller fragments, thus will not significantly reduce the plastic entering the
landfill flow, and the additives in the plastic will also be degraded to release substances
that may affect the environment [7]. Chemical treatment requires the use of solvents that
are not environmentally friendly and always result in the release of byproducts such as
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), terephthalic acid, anhydrides, carboxylic
acids, and esters [8].
To confront the imminent peril of plastic accumulation in marine and terrestrial
environments, it is crucial to implement efficient biodegradative methods that alleviate the
burden of plastic in the environment.
1.2. PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis
PET does not biodegrade well and instead accumulates as garbage. It was recently
discovered that bacteria and fungi possess thermophilic hydrolases, which are best suited
for catalysing PET hydrolysis at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, enzymes derived
from Ideonella sakaiensis were reported to digest PET well at room temperature [9].
PETase, derived from I. sakaiensis, also identified as IsPETase, is an enzyme that has
similarities to cutinase. It has attracted attention as a potentially effective and innovative
approach to completely break down the polymer into its fundamental constituent units.
IsPETase exhibits increased activity at ambient temperatures and acts specifically on highly
crystalline PET [10], while the high-resolution (0.92 Å) X-Ray crystal structure of IsPETase
provided more information on the enzyme’s working mechanism and suggested that it is
not fully optimised for crystalline PET degradation [11].
There are concerns about the structural and sequence characteristics that enable
IsPETase to outperform its homologues at lower temperatures, since IsPETase can break
down PET films at ambient temperature, whereas other hydrolases require a high tem-
perature to promote PET hydrolysis [ 9]. Although with these advantages, the practical
implementation of IsPETase in the biodegradation of PET is hindered by its low solubil-
ity [12], highlighting the need to screen more similar enzymes to make IsPETase a more
feasible target to be engineered for PET’s biodegradation.
This review provides a focused synthesis of recent advances in the discovery and
engineering of PET-degrading enzymes, particularly homologues of IsPETase. We explore
innovative in silico and AI-driven screening strategies, evaluate diverse enzymatic activity
assays, and critically assess recombinant expression systems across bacterial, yeast, and
algal hosts. Emphasis is placed on enhancing enzyme solubility, secretion, and activity
through molecular and host-specific engineering approaches. By highlighting both the
progress and persistent challenges in PETase development, this review aims to guide
future research toward scalable, sustainable solutions for enzymatic PET biodegradation
and recycling.

2. Screening IsPETase Homologues
2.1. In Silico Screening
2.1.1. Amino Acid Sequence-Based Screening
Several research teams have employed in silico-based methodologies to screen en-
zymes exhibiting a high level of similarity to IsPETase, sourced from a diverse range of
microorganisms or environmental samples. The objective of these efforts is to identify
potential candidates for further genetic engineering. Researchers hope to accelerate the
degradation process of PET [13–15]. These screening approaches, as outlined in Figure 1,
offer a promising pathway towards the development of more effective biocatalysts for
environmental applications in plastic waste management.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Strategies to search novel IsPETase homologues. This schematic illustrates the main
computational approaches used to identify potential PET-degrading enzymes from genomic and
metagenomic databases. The strategies are broadly categorised into amino acid sequence-based
screening, which includes tools such as BLASTP to identify homologous sequences based on similarity
to IsPETase. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are also employed to detect conserved motifs across
large datasets.
Studies employing the strategies outlined in Figure 1 have been published. However,
only a tiny fraction of these investigations resulted in confirmed enzymatic activity of the
newly identified candidates, leaving further validation still required [14,16–19].
Many studies have utilised the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information;
http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) database for enzyme screening, employing a variety of in silico
strategies. These range from simpler methods such as BLSTP [15] to more advanced tech-
niques like PSI-BLAST [19,20]. These approaches are particularly appealing to researchers
without extensive bioinformatic expertise, as they are relatively straightforward to imple-
ment. Remarkably, they have proven effective in identifying promising enzyme candidates,
including novel enzymes whose activities have been experimentally validated.
For instance, a more comprehensive strategy was adopted by searching across multi-
ple databases, including NCBI, UniProt, and the JGI Integrated Microbial Genomes and
Microbiomes (JGI/IMG) database [ 14]. The researchers employed an IsPETase-specific
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based search algorithm, which enabled the discovery of
novel IsPETase homologues. Similarly, the MGnify database, another resource for micro-
biome data, was explored using an HMM-based approach [17]. Both studies successfully
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 4 of 18
identified enzymes that exhibited activity against PET, highlighting the efficiency of this
search technique in uncovering enzymes with plastic-degrading capabilities.
In contrast to the broad database-wide searches, other researchers have focused their
efforts on specific groups of microorganisms within databases. For example, the basic
BLASTP strategy was applied to 52 Streptomyces genome sequences obtained from NCBI,
which included 23 terrestrial and 29 marine isolates. The work targeted approach led to the
discovery of an IsPETase-like enzyme, whose activity was confirmed through experimental
assays [16]. On the other hand, BLAST searches were conducted across 7375 terrestrial
metagenomic samples in the JGI/IMG database [ 13] (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/). While
homologues closely related to IsPETase were identified, the activity of these candidates was
not tested, leaving their potential for PET degradation unverified.
These diverse strategies demonstrate the adaptability and potential of in silico screen-
ing in identifying promising enzymes for further study in PET biodegradation research.
2.1.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Driven and Structure-Based Screening
In addition to engineering IsPETase, AI tools have also been employed for PETase
screening. However, the limited number of experimentally confirmed PETases presents
a challenge for effective model training. To address this limitation, existing studies have
devised various strategies to enhance training datasets, thereby mitigating the need for
additional PETase sequences.
One machine learning (ML) model, employing the support vector machine method,
was trained using a dataset of PETase homologues derived from thermal metagenomes. The
homologues were collected through in silico screening based on amino acid sequences [21],
and the ML-assisted screening resulted in the identification of 74 candidate enzymes. Of
these, 51 were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, and 37 exhibited detectable PET
hydrolytic activity, including 23 enzymes that had not been previously reported.
In a separate study, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was utilised for data
augmentation. By employing a pre-trained deep Evolutionary Scale Language Model
(ESM), potential PET-degrading enzymes were identified from a custom-built metagenomic
library. Ultimately, 21 novel potential PET-degrading enzymes were identified through
structure analysis, though enzymatic activity assays were not conducted to confirm their
functionality [22].
To enhance the accuracy of in silico screening strategies, structural features were
considered during the screening phase, rather than being assessed solely at the confir-
mation stage. In one study, novel PETases were identified from the AlphaFold protein
structure database. Candidate enzymes were selected based on the presence of keyIsPETase
features, including an aspartic acid residue at positions 43–49 and a histidine residue at
positions 71–81, following the Ser-Met-Gly-Gly-Gly motif. These candidates were further
refined using the catalytic triad C- α mutual distance criterion, yielding an initial selec-
tion of 4594 putative PET hydrolases. Subsequent analysis, including sequence similarity
network construction and multiple sequence alignment, narrowed this to a final pool
of 107 candidate sequences. Although the most promising candidate, LSPET4, did not
surpass IsPETase in activity, mutatedIsPETase based on the structure feature of LSPET4
demonstrated a 9.32-fold increase in IsPETase hydrolytic activity at 45 ◦C [23].
Another study developed a novel PETase discovery pipeline by integrating protein
language models with a structural representation tree. The most promising enzyme identi-
fied, KbPETase, exhibited twice the activity of IsPETase at 30 ◦C. Notably, when compared
with FastPETase, the most active IsPETase mutant with the optimal catalytic performance
at 50 ◦C, KbPETase still displayed a catalytic efficiency 1.3 times greater than that of Fast-
PETase [24].

2.2. Assays to Screen PETase
Researchers typically combine in silico approaches with PET-degrading activity assays
to screen novel PETases. This dual approach allows them to identify enzymes that are
structurally similar to IsPETases and capable of degrading PET. The most commonly used
assays for measuring PET-degrading activity are depicted in Figure 2. These screening
techniques vary in scale from low to ultra-high throughput, depending on the context.
High and ultra-high throughput assays are generally employed when screening engineered
enzymes resulting from mutation or directed evolution [25–29]. However, when it comes
to screening IsPETase homologues from environmental samples or databases like NCBI,
medium or even low-throughput assays are often more suitable due to the low number of
hits from in silico searching. These lower throughput methods strike a balance between
efficiency and affordability, making them a more practical choice for such exploratory
studies, where fewer samples may be initially tested [14,30].
Figure 2. Assays to screen PET-degrading enzymes.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 6 of 18
Building on this framework, researchers tailor their choice of assay based on the nature
of the PETase candidates and the experimental constraints. Agar plate-based methods, for
example, provide a straightforward and visual means of assessing polymer degradation
but are limited by their low throughput [14,30]. Titrimetric methods, including the use of
pH-stat systems, provide a moderate-throughput alternative for quantifying acid release
during PET hydrolysis [31,32]. HPLC or LC/MS-based assays offer higher specificity and
sensitivity, enabling detailed quantification of degradation products, though they require
more time and instrumentation [20,33,34].
For high-throughput applications, colorimetric, turbidimetric, or fluorescent assays are
widely used due to their compatibility with microplate formats and automation [25,28,35].
At the ultra-high-throughput level, Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) allows for
rapid screening of vast enzyme libraries, particularly in yeast surface display systems [29].
While not typically used for routine screening, scanning electron microscope (SEM),
Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy serve as valuable
tools in specialised contexts [ 36–38]. These methods are slower, more costly, and lower
in throughput, but they provide unique insights into enzyme–substrate interactions and
the degradation of crystalline PET. As such, they are often employed to complement
biochemical assays in mechanistic or structural studies.
3. Heterologous Expression Platforms to Screen PETases
Beyond screening for novel homologues, IsPETase itself has been engineered to en-
hance its properties. Challenges such as inefficient enzyme secretion and cytoplasmic
stress have led to the development of secretion expression and surface display platforms
in diverse hosts [39]. These advanced platforms facilitate the rapid screening of enzyme
variants, eliminating the need for cell lysis and avoiding the formation of inclusion bodies,
thereby streamlining the screening process [12,40,41].
The successful expression of IsPETase and its homologues in heterologous systems
is critical for both fundamental research and industrial applications. Various microbial
hosts, including bacteria, yeasts, and microalgae, have been explored for this purpose,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. For example, E. coli is widely used
due to its rapid growth and well-established genetic tools, while Bacillus subtilis offers
efficient secretion capabilities. Yeasts such as Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
provide eukaryotic post-translational modifications, and microalgae offer environmentally
sustainable platforms for enzyme production. In the following subsections, we examine
host-specific strategies that have been developed to enhance PETase expression, solubility,
and secretion in these systems.
3.1. Bacteria
3.1.1. E. coli
Most studies that have expressed IsPETase or its homologues in E. coli have utilised
pET-series vectors and BL21 (DE3) or derived strains, such as BL21 (DE3)-T1R [ 42] and
BL21-Gold (DE3) [26], with IPTG added to induce expression.
As an alternative to the widely used E. coli BL21 (DE3), E. coli SHuffle T7 was en-
gineered for the intracellular expression of IsPETaseMut, an active mutant of IsPETase.
This alternative was chosen due to the propensity of proteins with disulfide linkages to
misfold and accumulate as inclusion bodies during overexpression, a phenomenon initially
observed with the expression vectors pBAD and pET30a [43,44]. This was corroborated by
a separate study in which IsPETase was expressed in multiple E. coli hosts, with SHuffle T7
Express demonstrating the highest enzymatic activity. However, this advantage was not
observed for FastPETase (N233K/R224Q/S121E/D186H/R280A) [45] and Hot-PETase [46],
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 7 of 18
two variants of IsPETase [47]. An additional noteworthy finding indicated that the forma-
tion of inclusion bodies during the overexpression of IsPETaseMut in E. coli was primarily
attributed to protein aggregation driven by interactions among hydrophobic regions, rather
than the presence of disulfide bonds [12]. Consequently, the precise role of SHuffle T7 as an
expression host requires further elucidation.
A novel, growth-decoupled E. coli strain, enGenes Biotech’s e x-press V2, was em-
ployed in one study to express the PET-degrading enzyme polyester hydrolyse Leipzig
7 (PHL7) [ 48]. In this system, induction with arabinose inhibits E. coli host cell RNA
polymerase, thereby arresting cell growth and reallocating cellular resources to enhance re-
combinant protein production [49]. PET-degrading activity was detected in the unpurified
fermentation supernatant; however, enGenes ex-press V2 was not benchmarked against
established E. coli host strains [48].
Enhanced Secretion System
A frequently encountered challenge in expressingIsPETase inE. coli is its low solubility.
Current research has explored various strategies to address this limitation.
The Sec-dependent pathway is associated with post- and co-translational translocation
of pre-folded polypeptides across the inner membrane [26,42]. Signal peptides employing
the Sec-dependent pathway are frequently utilised, including PelB, PhoA, OmpC, OmpF,
OmpA, and MalE [50]. Among these, PelB has found widespread commercial use in pET
vector expression systems, such as pET20b, 22b, and 26b [ 50], making it a convenient
starting point for enhancing IsPETase secretion.
Employing this approach, IsPETase was cloned into pET22b(+), which contains the
DNA sequence for PelB, and subsequently generated a library via standard error-prone
PCR (epPCR) to induce mutations in PelB. Using an assay to evaluate the ability to degrade
4-pNPA (para-nitrophenyl acetate), they identified mutants IsPETase with significantly
enhanced activity. The increased PETase concentration in the supernatant correlated with
improved activity, exhibiting at least 1.7-fold enhancement across various assays [26].
In another study, multiple Sec-dependent signal peptides, including MalE, LamB,
and SurA, were tested and demonstrated that LamB, a maltoporin involved in maltose
transportation, facilitated the production of significantly higher levels of extracellular
IsPETase in E. coli [42].
Further advancements in the heterologous expression of IsPETase in E. coli were
achieved by modifying signal peptides with N-terminal enhancers. These enhancers,
derived from the endogenous signal peptide of β-fructofuranosidase (β-FFase) originating
from Arthrobacter arilaitensis NJEM01, proved effective in achieving extracellular synthesis
of IsPETase with increased enzymatic activity [51].
An intriguing finding in this area arises from the use of native signal peptides. When
an IsPETase homologue from Streptomyces sp. SM14 was expressed in E. coli with its native
signal peptide; the enzyme was successfully exported, as confirmed by the polycaprolactone
(PCL) plate clearing assay [16]. This result underscores the potential of leveraging native
signal peptides for effective extracellular expression and secretion in heterologous systems.
Chaperone Co-Expression and Fusion Tags
IsPETaseMut was co-expressed with three chaperone systems: GroEL/ES, Dnak/DnaJ/
GrpE, and TF. The findings revealed that IsPETaseMut co-expressed with GroEL/ES exhib-
ited a 12.5-fold increase in expression levels [12]. These results align with previous studies
indicating that co-expression with chaperones enhances protein solubility in E. coli [52].
An additional approach to avoiding inclusion body formation in E. coli involves
fusing highly soluble tags to recombinant proteins, such as maltose-binding protein (MBP),
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 8 of 18
transcription termination/anti-termination factor (NusA), thioredoxin (TrxA), and small
ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) [53]. Previous studies have demonstrated that NusA
offers superior soluble expression of cold-adapted Vibrio proteins in E. coli compared to
other fusion tags [54]. Similarly, substantial improvements in the solubility of IsPETaseMut
were achieved through co-expression with the chaperone GroEL/ES and the use of fusion
expression with NusA [12].
In a separate study, a novel fusion tag comprising carbohydrate-binding module
66 (CBM66) was fused with IsPETase. This approach resulted in significantly increased
expression levels of soluble IsPETase, achieving yields of approximately 370 mg/L [55].
More recently, the two strategies were combined to enhanceIsPETase production. A
vesicle nucleating peptide (VNp) tag-based secretion system was utilised in conjunction
with the co-expression of the DnaJ-DnaK chaperone team. This combined approach resulted
in a marked improvement in the production of FastPETase, an IsPETase mutant with
enhanced hydrolytic activity [56].
Cell Surface Display (CSD) System
Microbial cell surface display systems enable peptides and proteins to be presented
on the surface of microbial cells by fusing them with anchoring motifs [ 57]. The outer
membrane-bound fatty acid transporter (FadL) from E. coli was previously demonstrated
to be effective for an esterase enzyme display on the surface of E. coli [58]. When FadL
was co-expressed with the CSD system, IsPETase exhibited activity in the tributyrin plate
clearing assay and demonstrated enhanced thermostability [40].
Building on the advancements in CSD systems, the PgsA protein from B. subtilis was
employed as an anchoring protein for the heterologous expression ofIsPETase in E. coli [59].
PgsA is part of the enzyme complex that synthesises poly- γ-glutamic acid (PGA) in B.
subtilis and has been fused with lipase B from Candida antarctica (CalB) to display the
enzyme in an active form on the cell surface of E. coli [60]. The fused protein was expressed
in E. coli, and it was confirmed that the active form of the IsPETase was present on the cell
surface of E. coli [59].
Increasing Membrane Permeability
Colicin families offer the functional diversity of unique cell-killing mechanisms that
allow the simultaneous release of recombinant enzymes from cells. Of over 20 colicins, the
lysis gene from Colicin E7 was effectively reported to enhance the secretion of intracellular
recombinant enzymes fromE. coli [61]. An IsPETase homologue screened from metagenome
analysis, F148, was co-expressed with Colicin E7 in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Compared with
the control strain only expressing F148, during the same period, nearly 3-fold degradation
products could be observed, since Colicin E7 enabled protein release simultaneously by
obstructing the outer membrane through phospholipase activation [62].
In another study, a comparable strategy was adopted by fusingIsPETase with Thermob-
ifida fusca cutinase, an IsPETase homologue previously reported to degrade phospholipids
and thereby increase cell membrane permeability [ 63]. This approach successfully en-
hanced enzyme secretion, providing another example of facilitating secretion through the
modulation of cell membrane permeability [64].
3.1.2. B. subtilis
B. subtilis is widely recognised as a robust biotechnological workhorse for the het-
erologous expression of enzymes. Its non-pathogenic nature and designation as a GRAS
(generally regarded as safe) microorganism render it fully compliant with regulatory re-
quirements for industrial applications [65,66]. Similar strategies to those employed in E. coli
have been adapted for use in B. subtilis to enhance the extracellular expression of IsPETases.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 9 of 18
Enhanced Secretion System
The use of five Bacillus-derived signal peptides for expressing IsPETase was inves-
tigated in B. subtilis WB600, a strain derived from B. subtilis 168 with six protease genes
knocked out [67]. The signal peptides tested were amy from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Sac
and AprE, both from B. subtilis 168; apr and BprA, both from Bacillus licheniformis WX-02.
Among these, the signal peptide amy (SPamy) demonstrated the most significant effect,
increasing enzyme activity in the cell culture supernatant nearly four-fold [68].
In contrast to studies on IsPETase expression in E. coli, which consistently reported
that the Sec-dependent secretion pathway enhances IsPETase secretion, research on B.
subtilis has yielded conflicting results. In a separate study, the expression of IsPETase in B.
subtilis 168 was examined using three Sec signal peptides (AmyE, Bpr, and SacB) and two
Tat signal peptides (PhoD and YwbN), which direct proteins through the twin-arginine
translocation (Tat) pathway. However, none of these signal peptides improvedIsPETase
secretion compared to its native signal peptide [69]. Thusfurther research is required to
elucidate the discrepancies observed in the findings of these studies.
Chaperone Overexpression
In B. subtilis CBS2, the hrcA gene, a negative regulator of the dnaK and groESL
operons [70,71], was inactivated. However, the protein titre of IsPETase was not improved
in the chaperone-overexpressing strain. In contrast, a PET hydrolase from the bacterium
HR29 (BhrPETase) exhibited an approximately 20-fold increase in production [72].
3.2. Yeast
3.2.1. S. cerevisiae
Surface display systems have been adopted to enhance the extracellular concentration
of IsPETase. The anchoring protein GCW51 was successfully utilised to display IsPETase
on the surface of yeast [73]. In a more recent study, a novel surface display platform was
developed based on S. cerevisiae spores to display FastPETase [41].
Unlike the cell wall of vegetative S. cerevisiae cells, which consists of a two-layer
structure comprising β-glucan and mannan, the spore wall features a four-layer structure
composed of mannan, β-glucan, chitosan, and dityrosine. Displaying proteins on the
surface of S. cerevisiae spores offers distinct advantages over traditional cell surface display,
as it eliminates the need for transmembrane transport. Furthermore, the unique structure
of the spore wall imparts resistance to environmental stresses, as demonstrated by a study,
where the displayed FastPETase exhibited significantly improved thermostability [45].
Yeast surface display systems provide a promising approach to producingIsPETase,
offering the advantages of bypassing enzyme purification, resulting in substantial time and
cost savings, and facilitating the reuse of the biocatalyst.
3.2.2. Yarrowia lipolytica
Y. lipolytica has been identified as a potential host for the expression of IsPETase,
owing to its ability to assimilate atypical carbon sources, allowing for the assimilation
of degradation products from PET [74]. Following the successful expression of IsPETase
in Y. lipolytica, the same group optimised its expression by testing various pre-treatment
methods [75]. However, in comparison to other host systems, research in Y. lipolytica
has yet to progress towards a deeper understanding and optimisation at the molecular
biology level.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 10 of 18
3.2.3. P . pastoris
The methylotrophic yeast P . pastorisis widely recognised as a versatile workhorse for
the production of heterologous proteins in industrial applications [76,77]. This expression
system has been shown to support efficient secretory expression, and its post-translational
glycosylation further enhances expression yields by increasing the resistance of glyco-
proteins to proteolytic degradation [78,79]. In another study, IsPETase was successfully
expressed in P . pastoris, demonstrating significant improvements in the enzyme’s specific
activity and thermostability both for native IsPETase and FastPETase [80].
In another study, a chaperone co-expression strategy was employed in P . pastoris
to enhance the production of the FastPETase variant, FastPETase-212/277. A panel of
chaperones was evaluated, including protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), thiol oxidase
(Ero1), the bZIP transcription factor HAC1, and proprotein convertase Kex2. Among these,
Ero1 was identified as the most effective in boosting expression [81].
3.3. Microalgae
Microalgae present a compelling option for the synthesis of recombinant plastic-
degrading enzymes and various environmental applications, owing to their ubiquitous
presence in aquatic systems, minimal production of endotoxins, and ability to grow without
the need for supplemental organic carbon [82]. In a study, the photosynthetic microalga
Phaeodactylum tricornutum was employed to secrete a modified PETase, PETaseR280A, into
the surrounding culture medium for PET degradation. The gene encoding PETaseR280A
was co-expressed with the signal peptide of P . tricornutumalkaline phosphatase. The
secreted enzyme demonstrated PET-degrading activity, confirming successful expression
and secretion [83]. However, the application of P . tricornutumis constrained by its specific
growth requirements, including low temperatures, silica as a nutrient, and high salinity.
To overcome these limitations,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a GRAS-designated fresh-
water microalga, was employed in a subsequent study for the expression of wild-type
IsPETase. C. reinhardtii was selected due to its faster growth rate and freshwater habitat [84].
While the enzyme’s activity was confirmed, the authors did not specify whether a signal
peptide was employed to assist the secretion, and enzyme activity was assessed using
cell lysates.
In another study, C. reinhardtii was employed as the host organism, with the original
signal peptide retained to target the recombinant protein to the thylakoid lumen. This
study differed by integrating the IsPETase gene into the plastome at a specific site, restoring
a photosynthesis-essential gene. This restoration allowed antibiotic-free selection following
gene integration [85].
In summary, these findings underscore the potential of bioengineered microalgae for
producing IsPETase and homologues, offering promising applications in bioremediation
strategies for PET-polluted aquatic environments.
4. Microbial Expression Systems for IsPETases and Homologues
The exploration of microbial platforms for IsPETase expression and the advancement
of in silico analyses, screening assays, and novel enzyme discovery strategies underscore
the rapid progress in this field.
4.1. Prokaryotic Hosts
Microbial hosts, particularly E. coli (Table 1), remain the backbone for heterologous ex-
pression, offering high yields and a broad toolkit for genetic manipulation. Sec-dependent
secretion pathways, fusion tags, and chaperone co-expression strategies have been in-
strumental in improving the solubility, stability, and extracellular secretion of IsPETase.

Recent integrative approaches, such as combining vesicle nucleating peptides with chap-
erone systems, have further advanced production levels. However, limitations such as
protein misfolding and inclusion body formation necessitate continued optimisation and
host-specific engineering.

Note: √ indicates that the corresponding strategy has been applied to the microbial host for enhancing IsPETase
expression or secretion.
CSD systems represent a complementary approach, allowing IsPETase localisation
on the cell membrane and bypassing purification steps. The use of anchor proteins such
as FadL and PgsA in E. coli has resulted in enhanced enzyme activity and thermostability.
While promising, further investigation into the stability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness
of CSD systems is essential to translate these findings into industrial applications.
In B. subtilis, signal peptide optimisation, such as the use of amy from B. amyloliquefa-
ciens, has demonstrated success in increasing extracellular IsPETase production. However,
conflicting results regarding Sec- and Tat-dependent pathways underscore the complex-
ity of secretion mechanisms in this host. Comparative molecular studies are needed to
elucidate these discrepancies and fully harness B. subtilis as an efficient expression host
with a secretion system. Only the strategies of enhancing the secretion system with signal
peptides and co-expressing chaperones have been explored in B. subtilis to date (Table 1).
Several fusion tags have been developed to facilitate the secretion of target proteins in B.
subtilis, including cellulase [ 86], SUMO3 [87], Spy [88], and lysyl tRNA synthetase [ 89].
Further studies are anticipated to improve IsPETase secretion and extracellular production
in this expression host.
As B. subtilis spores can be readily engineered to display heterologous antigens or
proteins on their surface, the CSD system has been adapted for spore-surface display in
B. subtilis [90]. Regarding the final strategy, which has been successfully employed in E.
coli, thereby increasing membrane permeability to enhance protein secretion, there are also
successful examples in B. subtilis. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the addition
of Triton X-100 increased the secretion level of γ-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase by 21.5%,
an effect attributed to enhanced cell membrane permeability [91].
Thus, future research could focus on advancing B. subtilis as an expression host for
IsPETases through the development of fusion tag technology, spore–surface display systems,
and strategies for modulating cell membrane permeability.
4.2. Eukaryotic Hosts
Eukaryotic hosts, including yeasts and microalgae, offer unique advantages due to
their advanced post-translational modification systems and regulatory compliance for
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 6797 12 of 18
industrial applications. P . pastorishas shown significant potential, with glycosylation im-
proving enzyme stability and chaperone co-expression strategies enhancing yields [ 81].
Yeast surface display systems, particularly those employing S. cerevisiae spores, have inno-
vatively addressed the challenges of purification and environmental stress resistance [92].
Microalgae, such as P . tricornutumand C. reinhardtii, have emerged as promising platforms
for IsPETase production in aquatic environments [93,94]. However, challenges related to
scalability, nutrient requirements, and environmental conditions must be addressed to
maximise the potential of these hosts. Furthermore, only a limited number of strategies
have been tested in these systems to enhance IsPETase secretion, leaving considerable
potential for the exploration and implementation of alternative approaches.
4.3. Expression and Production of IsPETase and Homologues in Scaled-Up Systems
The industrial-scale application of IsPETase and homologues hinges on the devel-
opment of robust, high-yield expression systems capable of producing active enzymes
under fermentor conditions. While significant strides have been made in engineering
IsPETase variants with enhanced activity and thermostability, translating these advances
into scalable bioprocesses remains a key challenge.
Among the various microbial hosts explored, E. coli remains the most widely used
due to its rapid growth, well-characterised genetics, and ease of manipulation. However, P .
pastoris has demonstrated superior capabilities in protein secretion and post-translational
modifications. Notably, co-expression of the chaperone Ero1 in P . pastoris, combined
with a high-cell-density fed-batch fermentation strategy in a 30-L bioreactor, enabled the
production of up to 3.23 g/L of secreted FastPETase [81]. This represents one of the highest
reported yields for the expression of IsPETase and homologues in a eukaryotic system.
Although this system demonstrated excellent productivity, it required complex media and
extended cultivation times to achieve optimal results.
In E. coli, the highest yield to date was also achieved for FastPETase, using a synergistic
strategy that combined co-expression of cognate chaperones (DnaK/DnaJ from I. sakaiensis)
with fusion of VNp6. This approach enabled the secretion of over 2 g/L FastPETase in a 5 L
fed-batch fermenter [56].
Despite these promising results, several limitations persist. One of the most significant
challenges is the lack of standardisation in reporting outcomes. Many studies use en-
zyme activity or PET degradation efficiency as proxies for expression levels, which allows
researchers to avoid time-consuming purification procedures [95]. While this approach
is practical, it complicates direct comparison across studies. This inconsistency in met-
rics, combined with variations in substrate type, reaction conditions, and quantification
methods, hampers reproducibility and comparative assessment.
5. Conclusions
In summary, the combination of advanced expression systems, in silico methods,
screening assays, and extracellular production strategies is accelerating the development
of IsPETase for PET degradation. However, the field still faces challenges, including
the scalability of production systems, discrepancies in secretion efficiency across hosts,
and the need for standardised screening protocols. Interdisciplinary approaches that
integrate synthetic biology, computational modelling, and environmental microbiology
hold the key to overcoming these challenges and advancing the application of IsPETase
for sustainable bioremediation. Additionally, exploring the potential of diverse microbial
systems could provide novel insights and enhance the robustness of PET degradation
strategies. Continued investment in these areas will be crucial for developing effective and
scalable solutions to address plastic pollution.

Furthermore, while laboratory-scale advancements in PETase engineering are promis-
ing, their translation to industrial-scale applications presents significant challenges. These
include the need for cost-effective and high-yield fermentation systems, robust enzyme
stability under process conditions, and integration into existing waste management in-
frastructures. Although various microbial hosts have been explored for the expression of
IsPETase and its homologues, including E. coli, B. subtilis, yeasts, and microalgae, compara-
tive studies remain limited, and each system presents distinct advantages and constraints.
E. coli is the most widely used host due to its rapid growth and genetic tractability, but
issues such as inclusion body formation and limited secretion efficiency persist. B. subtilis
offers better secretion potential but yields inconsistent results across signal peptide sys-
tems. Yeasts like P . pastorisprovide post-translational modifications and improved enzyme
stability, while microalgae offer sustainable platforms but are still in early development
stages. Despite these advances, the state-of-the-art in IsPETase expression under fermentor
conditions is still emerging. Limitations such as low solubility, inefficient folding, and sub-
optimal secretion continue to hinder large-scale application. Regulatory hurdles such as the
approval of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for environmental use, biosafety con-
cerns, and compliance with international standards also pose barriers to implementation.
Addressing these issues will require interdisciplinary collaboration among biotechnologists,
process engineers, and policymakers to ensure that PETase-based biodegradation strategies
are not only scientifically viable but also scalable, safe, and regulatory-compliant.
