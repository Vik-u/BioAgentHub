1.Introduction
Biomanufacturing chemicals using micro-
bial cell factories has emerged as a sus-
tainable and promising alternative to con-
ventionalpetrochemicalsynthesis,aligning
more closely with the principles of green
chemistry and sustainable development.[1]
Over the past decades, metabolic engineer-
ing has played a pivotal role in enhancing
the eﬃciency of microbial chemical pro-
duction, resulting in engineered microor-
ganisms currently utilized in industrial-
scale processes.[2,3] However, despite sig-
niﬁcant advancements, relying solely on
metabolic engineering to rewrite and op-
timize the primary metabolism of chas-
sis cells often falls short of achieving eco-
nomically viable titers, rates, and yields
(TRY).[4] This shortfall is primarily due to
physiological constraints inherent to mi-
crobial chassis that impede ﬁnely tuned
biosynthetic pathways.[5] One major con-
straint is the limited tolerance of micro-
bialhoststoendproducts,suchasbiofuels
and other biochemicals.[6–9] As these products accumulate, they
exert stress on the cells, adversely aﬀecting cellular ﬁtness and
growth, which ultimately restricts overall production TRY.[10]
Overcomingtolerancechallengesisthereforeessentialtounlock-
ingthefullpotentialofmicrobialcellfactoriesandachievingin-
dustriallyrelevantproductionlevels. [11]
Inprinciple,microbialchassiswithenhancedtolerancetospe-
ciﬁc compounds could be rationally designed based on prior
knowledge. However, in practice, this process is rarely straight-
forwardduetothecomplexityofmicrobialmetabolicandregula-
torynetworks.Alternatively,adaptivelaboratoryevolution(ALE),

tionaryprocesses,iswidelyusedtoachieverobusttolerancephe-
notypes. ALE has proven eﬀective in enhancing host microbial
tolerance to compounds such as 1,3-propanediol,[10] ferulate,[12]
and isobutyl acetate,[13] demonstrating its eﬀectiveness in cer-
tain contexts. Despite its successes in many applications, tradi-
tionalALEhasnotablelimitations.Typically,ALEbeginswiththe
pure culture of a wild-type microbial host as the starting point

for evolutionary processes.[14] However, microorganisms inher-
ently exhibit low spontaneous mutation rates, which can signif-
icantly extend the time required to observe meaningful pheno-
typicchanges.[15] Theselowspontaneousmutationratescanalso
resultinevolutionaryfailurewhendesiredhigh-tolerancestrains
are not obtained. Consequently, the ALE process often becomes
exceptionally time-consuming and labor-intensive to carry out
eﬀectively.[16]
Moreover,theultimategoalofeﬀectivetoleranceengineering
is not only to enhance microbial resilience under high chemi-
calconcentrationsbutalsotosustainhighproductionmetrics. [11]
Complicatingmattersfurther,alleviatinggrowthinhibitiondoes
notnecessarilyleadtoincreasedproduction.Thisparadoxarises
because, when encountering high product toxicity or environ-
mentalstress,microorganismsmayredistributeinternalenergy
and resources to prioritize survival over production.[17] For in-
stance, cells with increased tolerance may allocate more energy
towardprotectivemechanismssuchasmembranerepair,antiox-
idantdefenses,andtheexpressionofanti-stressproteins. [18] This

uct,leadingtodecreasedproduction. [19] Asaresult,althoughen-
hancedtolerancesupportssurvival,theaddedmetabolicburden
mayhindertheoverallproductivityofthebioprocess.
To overcome the limitations of traditional ALE in tolerance
engineering, we propose a reﬁned strategy designed to acceler-
ate and streamline the evolution process while overcoming the
trade-oﬀ between enhanced tolerance and sustained production
capabilities. Instead of initiating ALE with a wild-type pure cul-
ture,ourapproachemploysamutagenizedmicrobiallibrary,in-

strategyisexpectedtoimprovetheprobabilityofevolvingstrains

the eﬃciency of the ALE process. Additionally, we integrate this
mutagenized library with an automated microbial microdroplet
culture(MMC)systemandincorporatehigh-throughputscreen-
ing techniques.[20] The MMC system enables high-throughput
cultivation of microorganisms within microliter-scale droplets,
substantially improving the scalability and eﬃciency of ALE
experiments while minimizing resource consumption. Beyond
high-throughput cultivation, the system integrates multiple au-
tomated functions, including serial passaging, real-time optical
density monitoring, gradient-based addition of chemical stres-
sors, and programmable droplet sorting for the isolation of tar-
get subpopulations. This miniaturized, closed-loop platform re-
duces reagent usage, manual workload, and contamination risk
whileenablinghigh-throughput,precise,long-termadaptiveevo-
lution. Furthermore, high-throughput screening technology is
employedtoidentifymutantsthatnotonlyexhibitimprovedtol-
erance but also maintain or enhance production performance.
Thisintegrationofmutagenizedlibraries,automatedcultivation,
and high-throughput screening signiﬁcantly reduces the time
andeﬀorttypicallyrequiredforALE,whileincreasingthelikeli-
hoodofdiscovering“win-win”chassisthatcombinerobuststress
tolerance with superior production capabilities. Through this
comprehensive and eﬃcient strategy, we aim to overcome the
challengesoftraditionalALEandadvancetoleranceengineering
inmicrobialsystems.
Here, as a proof-of-concept, we focused on the tolerance en-
gineering ofEscherichia coli to enhance the biosynthesis of 3-
hydroxypropionicacid(3-HP),servingasanexampletotestand
validateourproposed strategy. Wechose3-HPbiosynthesisdue
to its designation as one of the 12 high-value platform chem-
icals by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its signiﬁ-
cant industrial potential.[21] However, the inherent toxicity of 3-
HP to microbial hosts has posed a critical challenge to achiev-
ing eﬃcient production.[22] Speciﬁcally, we performed in vivo
mutagenesis (IVM) to generate a diverse genetic library ofE.
coli W3110,[23] which served as the starting point for ALE in
the MMC system. Through this approach, the evolution pro-
cess was signiﬁcantly accelerated and simpliﬁed. Furthermore,
abiosensor-assistedhigh-throughputscreeningplatformwases-
tablished and utilized to identify individuals with superior pro-
ductioneﬃciencyfromtheevolvedpopulations.Notably,weob-
tained strains with the “win-win” phenotype, characterized by a
balance between increased tolerance and improved production
capacity. Through transcriptomic sequencing, we also revealed
the mechanisms contributing to enhanced 3-HP tolerance and
biosynthesiscapacity,providinginsightsintothegeneticandreg-
ulatory changes involved. In summary, our study presents a re-
ﬁned strategy that integrates IVM-coupled ALE and biosensor-
assistedselectiontoresolvethetrade-oﬀbetweenmicrobialtoler-
anceandproductioneﬃciency.Thisapproachnotonlyaddresses

2.1.MetabolicEngineeringofthe3-HPBiosyntheticPathway
Pathway engineering for 3-HP biosynthesis is a crucial founda-
tion for subsequent tolerance engineering eﬀorts. As an initial
step, we focused on establishing a functional 3-HP biosynthetic
pathway. To this end, a tailored chassis, designated as TD, was
constructed by deleting multiple genes (adhE, pﬂB, ldhA, poxB,
pta-ackA,a n dyqhD)i nE. coliW3110 (Figure 1a). These dele-
tions targeted pathways responsible for the synthesis of major
by-products, such as ethanol, formate, lactate, acetate, and 1,3-
propanediol,[21] with the goal of minimizing by-product accu-
mulation and streamlining metabolic ﬂux toward 3-HP produc-
tion (Figure1a). The 3-HP biosynthetic pathway was recruited
into chassis TD through the heterologous expression of key en-
zymes derived fromKlebsiella pneumoniae, speciﬁcally glycerol
dehydratase (GDHt, encoded bydhaBCE), its activator (GDR,
encoded bygdrAB), and𝛾-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH,encodedby KpydcW).[22] Additionally,theglycerolfacili-
tator(GlpF,encodedby glpF)wasoverexpressedtoimproveglyc-
erol uptake (Figure1a). The constitutive promoters tac and trc
wereemployedtodrivetheexpressionofthe dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF
cassette andKpydcW gene, respectively (Figure1b). This design

tainedGDHtactivity,therebyenhancingtherobustnessandeﬃ-
ciencyof3-HPbiosynthesis. [24]
It is important to emphasize that 3-HPA is highly cytotoxic,
and its accumulation can severely impair cell growth and en-
zyme activity, ultimately reducing 3-HP production.[25] There-
fore,ratherthansimplyincreasingtheexpressionofbothGDHt
and ALDH, it is essential to achieve an appropriate balance be-
tweenthesetwoenzymestopreventtoxicbuildupof3-HPAwhile
ensuring eﬃcient biosynthesis of 3-HP. To accomplish this, we
integrated the tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF and trc-KpydcW expres-
sion cassettes into plasmids with varying copy numbers. By
strategicallyconﬁguringdiﬀerentplasmidcombinations(Figure
S1a, Supporting Information), we ﬁne-tuned the 3-HP biosyn-
thetic pathway in chassis TD, constructing a total of 10 engi-
neered strains (TD S1–TD S10). These strains were subjected
to shake-ﬂask fermentation in modiﬁed M9 medium supple-
mentedwith10gL −1 glycerol.Amongthesestrains,TDS6exhib-
itedsuperioreﬃciencyin3-HPproduction(Figure 1c–e),achiev-
ing a titer of 5.13 g L−1 with negligible accumulation of 3-HPA
(FigureS1b,SupportingInformation).Thus,theplasmidconﬁg-
uration, comprising p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF and pBR322-
trc-KpydcW,harboredbyTDS6,wasselectedforfurtherapplica-
tions.
2.2.ToleranceEngineeringofChassisTDthroughaReﬁnedALE
Strategy
To enhance the 3-HP tolerance of chassis TD, we adopted the
reﬁned ALE strategy. This approach involves utilizing a mutag-
enized microbial library as the initial population for ALE, pro-
moting genetic diversity. The increased diversity allows natural
selection to act immediately on advantageous variants without
relyingsolelyonspontaneousmutations,therebyfacilitatingthe
rapid acquisition of a highly tolerant phenotype. IVM technol-
ogy,selectedforitsbroad-spectrumapplicabilityandoperational
simplicity, was employed to construct the mutagenized micro-
bial library based on chassis TD. Speciﬁcally, we employed the
plasmid-based IVM system MP6,[23] which was further modi-
ﬁed by replacing its original replicon with the thermo-sensitive
replicon pSC101(ts). This modiﬁcation led to the generation of

bilityoftherepliconpSC101(ts),wecuredpMP6tsandobtained
the mutagenized microbial library derived from TD, designated
asTD-MUT,forsubsequentALEexperiments( Figure2a).
To increase microbial cultivation throughput and reduce re-
liance on manual labor, we employed the automated, high-
throughput MMC system to facilitate the ALE process.[20] Con-
sidering the distinct diﬀerences between the MMC system and
traditional shake ﬂask cultivation in terms of cultivation modes
andopticaldensitymeasurementmethods,weﬁrstassessedthe
3-HPtoleranceofthechassisstrainTDwithintheMMCsystem
to ensure its suitability. This evaluation was conducted using a
“single-factor,multi-level”experimentalframework,where3-HP
concentrationwassetasthesolevariableandtestedacrossmul-
tiple levels (0, 180, 360, 540, and 720 mM). In this context, con-
centrationswereexpressedin“mM”unitstofacilitateconvenient

tested concentrations of 180, 360, 540, and 720 mM correspond
to≈15.8,31.6,47.4,and63.2gL −1,respectively.UndertheMMC
system, the growth of TD was signiﬁcantly inhibited when the
concentration of 3-HP reached 360 mM (p < 0.001), and nearly
ceased at concentrations above 540 mM (Figure2b). These ob-
servationswereconsistent withtheresultsobtainedfromshake

Subsequently,TD-MUTwasemployedastheinitialpopulation

tionthroughautomatedserialpassagingandcontinuouscultiva-
tion (Figure2a). To maximize throughput, 50 microdroplet cul-
tivation units (droplets 1–50) were established within the MMC
system, functioning as the equivalent of 50 parallel shake-ﬂask
cultures.Thesedropletswereactivatedthroughasinglegenera-

passagesperformedateachconcentrationleveltoallowsuﬃcient

growth curves of individual microdroplets shown in Figure2c.
During the activation phase of cultivation, in the absence of 3-
HP, all droplets exhibited generally favorable growth. However,
notablevariationsingrowthperformancewereobservedamong
droplets.Sinceweusedamutagenizedlibraryratherthanapure
culture as the starting point for evolution, the observed diﬀer-
ences can be attributed to the distinct genetic characteristics of
thecellpopulationswithinindividualdroplets,originatingfrom
TD-MUT. During the subsequent evolution phase, as the selec-
tionpressurefrom3-HPprogressivelyincreased,thegrowthpat-
terns among the droplets diverged further, particularly within
the concentration range of 270 to 450 mM. Notably, this diver-
gencewasmostevidentindropletssuchasdroplet31anddroplet
19, where cells were unable to withstand the pressure and per-
ishedentirelywhenthe3-HPpressurereached360mM(Figure
S3, Supporting Information). Such a pronounced divergence in
growth trends is rarely observed when ALE is performed using
pure cultures.[26] Interestingly, as the 3-HP concentration fur-
therincreasedto630mM,thediﬀerentiationingrowthpatterns
among the surviving droplets became diminished. This obser-
vation suggests that during the ALE process, as selective pres-
sureintensiﬁed,cellpopulationsharboringbeneﬁcialmutations
for3-HPtolerancemanagedtosurviveandgraduallydominated
withinthesurvivingdroplets.Consequently,thecellsinthesur-
viving droplets acquired superior 3-HP tolerance and exhibited
more stabilized growth patterns. After 12 days of ALE, the sur-
viving droplets exhibited markedly enhanced tolerance to 3-HP,
demonstrating the ability to sustain growth under the selective
pressureof720mM3-HP.
2.3.Evaluationof3-HPToleranceandBiosynthesisPerformance
During the ﬁnal stage of adaptation to the 720 mM 3-HP gradi-
ent,theOD MMC (opticaldensitywithintheMMCsystem)values
of the surviving droplets ranged from 2.05 to 3.70 (Figure2d).
Notably,droplets2,1,and5exhibitedthehighestOD MMC values.
These droplets were subsequently extracted from the MMC sys-
tem for further propagation and detailed characterization. The
growthofdroplets2,1,and5wasinitiallyevaluatedinmodiﬁed
M9mediumcontaining720mM3-HPundershakeﬂaskcondi-
tions. The results revealed that all three droplets displayed nor-
mal growth with similar growth trends, among which droplet 2
showed a slight growth advantage (Figure2e). To further study
thepropertiesofdroplet2,itscultivationwasdilutedandplated
to isolate individual colonies. Nine colonies, randomly selected
and designated as RAND1–RAND9, were characterized in de-
tail to assess their 3-HP tolerance and production capabilities.
Growth assessments revealed that all tested colonies were ca-
pable of growing under 720 mM 3-HP conditions (Figure2f).
The ﬁnal biomass of the tested colonies, reﬂected as a dry cell
mass (DCM) of≈0.6 g L−1, was lower than the 1.0 g L−1 ob-
served in the absence of 3-HP (FigureS4, Supporting Informa-
tion).Nevertheless,thisresultrepresentedasigniﬁcantimprove-
ment(p<0.001)comparedtothecompletegrowthinhibitionex-

fromdroplet 2 successfully acquired thedesired 3-HPtolerance
phenotypethroughIVM-coupledALE.
Subsequently, the previously constructed 3-HP biosynthetic
pathway was introduced into the isolated 3-HP-tolerant chas-
sis(RAND1–RAND9),resultinginstrainsdesignatedasRAND1

these strains, fermentations were carried out in modiﬁed M9

only RAND7 S6 achieving a notable 11.11% increase (p < 0.05).

ticular, RAND2 S6 exhibited the lowest 3-HP titer at 2.73 g L−1,
representing a 46.78% decrease compared to TD S6. The varia-
tion in 3-HP biosynthetic performance suggested that, even af-
terALE,thecellpopulationindroplet2remainedgeneticallydi-
verse, consisting of cells with varying traits. As the evolutionary
direction of ALE targeted 3-HP tolerance exclusively, most cells
inthispopulationacquiredgeneticmutationsthatimprovedtol-
erance rather than enhancing production. Additionally, certain
mutations may inadvertently disrupt key metabolic pathways or
regulatorynetworks,potentiallyimpairing3-HPsynthesis.These
might account for the observed variations in 3-HP production
amongthestrains(RAND1S6–RAND9S6).
Theaforementionedobservationsdemonstratedthecomplex-
ity of engineering microbial chassis to simultaneously achieve
robusttoleranceandeﬃcientbiosyntheticperformance,indicat-
ing the necessity of balancing enhanced tolerance with biosyn-
thetic eﬃciency. Since IVM can generate a broad spectrum of
mutations,itisplausiblethatsomecellsindroplet2mayexhibit
phenotypesforboth3-HPtoleranceandhighproductionconcur-
rently.Giventhatthecellsindroplet2alreadydisplayeda3-HP-
tolerant phenotype, our subsequent eﬀorts will therefore priori-
tize high-throughput screening of these individuals in droplet 2
to identify cells exhibiting a “win-win” phenotype characterized
bybothhigh3-HPtoleranceandelevatedproduction.
2.4.DesignandModulationofa3-HP-ResponsiveBiosensor
Due to the lack of tailored tools for high-throughput detection
of3-HPinmicrobialfermentationsystems,innovativesolutions
areneeded. Developing biosensors that can speciﬁcally respond
to target metabolites and translate signals into measurable out-
puts, such as ﬂuorescence or luminescence, oﬀers a promising
approachforestablishinghigh-throughputscreeningplatforms.
Accordingly,weaimedtodesignandconstructa3-HPresponsive

2.4.1. Identiﬁcation of a 3-HP Responsive Genetic Element
In H. bluephagenesis, the addition of 3-HP has been reported
to activate a 3-HP degradation pathway involving two genes,
GME_RS01255 and GME_RS01260.[27] This activation, speciﬁ-
callyinducedby3-HP,suggeststheexistenceofgeneticelements
in H. bluephagenesis that response to 3-HP. These elements
could be harnessed for the development of a 3-HP-responsive
biosensor. Genome analysis revealed thatGME_RS01255 and
GME_RS01260 are located adjacent to each other and share a
common promoter, hereafter referred to as PhpTD (Figure S5,
Supporting Information). Interestingly, upstream of these two
genes,anothergeneannotatedasaLysR-familytranscriptionfac-
tor (LysR-TF), GME_RS01250 (hereafter referred to as HPTDR,
with its encoding gene designated ashpTDR), was identiﬁed
(Figure3a).Notably,thisgeneistranscribedintheoppositedirec-
tionto GME_RS01255andGME_RS01260,indicatingaclosege-
neticassociationandpotentialregulatoryinteraction(Figure 3a).
LysR-TFs typically regulate genes involved in metabolism,
stressresponses,andbiosynthesisthroughsmall-moleculebind-
ing and conformational changes that control their activities.[28]
Basedonthis,wehypothesizedthatHPTDRfunctionsasaregu-
latoryprotein.Speciﬁcally,weproposethatitactsasarepressor,
regulatingtheexpressionofGME_RS01255andGME_RS01260
in response to the presence or absence of 3-HP. In the ab-
sence of 3-HP, HPTDR is predicted to bind to the PhpTD pro-
moter region, blocking RNA polymerase access and silencing
transcription (Figure3b). Conversely, in the presence of 3-HP,
the molecule is speculated to interact with HPTDR, triggering
a conformational change that reduces its aﬃnity for the PhpTD
promoter. This allows RNA polymerase to access the promoter,
initiating the transcription and activating the 3-HP degradation
pathway(Figure 3b).
To validate this hypothesis, we conducted further bioinfor-
matics analyses of HPTDR and investigated its interaction with
3-HP. Protein family and domain analysis using the InterPro
database conﬁrmed that HPTDR is a typical LysR-TF, featuring
a DNA-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain con-
nectedbyalinkerpeptide(Figure 3c,d).Thisuniquestructuralar-
rangementischaracteristicofLysR-TF,whichregulatesgeneex-

and Ala203 (Figure3e). Together, these residuals form a stable
binding pocket, ensuring the positioning of 3-HP. This interac-
tionlikelytriggersaconformationalchangeinHPTDR,leading

PhpTD, activating transcription and triggering a strong ﬂuores-
cencesignal,representingthe“on”state(Figure 3g).Tovalidate
biosensor functionality, we also constructed two control biosen-
sors:SENNEGA,lackingthe sfGFPgene,andSENPOSI,lacking
thehpTDRgene.SENNEGAcannotproduceﬂuorescence,serv-
ing as the negative control. SEN POSI, devoid of HPTDR, leads
toconstitutiveactivationofP hpTD andcontinuoussfGFPexpres-
sion,servingasthepositivecontrol.
The ﬂuorescence outputs of SEN T0, SEN NEGA, and SEN
POSIwereevaluatedacrossdiﬀerent3-HPconcentrations.Spe-
ciﬁc ﬂuorescence intensity (deﬁned as the ratio of ﬂuorescence
to biomass) was used to normalize signal output and eliminate
biomass-related variability. As expected, SEN NEGA displayed
negligible speciﬁc ﬂuorescence intensities, attributable to back-
ground noise from the chassis or system errors (Figure3h).
SEN POSI exhibited consistently high speciﬁc ﬂuorescence in-
tensities (≈20 000 a.u.) across all 3-HP concentrations, consis-
tent with constitutive sfGFP expression due to the absence of
HPTDR repression. SEN T0, in contrast, demonstrated a clear
3-HP-dependent response (Figure3h). Speciﬁc ﬂuorescence in-
tensity increased with rising 3-HP concentrations, indicating a
strong positive correlation. Higher 3-HP levels elicited stronger
ﬂuorescence signals, conﬁrming that SEN T0 eﬀectively senses
3-HP and that HPTDR modulates PhpTD-driven transcription in
responseto3-HPbinding.Thisdose-dependentﬂuorescencere-
sponse validates the rationality of our biosensor design and un-
derscores its potential application in quantifying environmental
3-HPconcentrations.
2.4.3. Optimization and Characterization of the Designed Biosensor
Thedynamicrangeofabiosensoriscriticalforaccurateandeﬃ-
cientdetectionacrossvaryingtargetmoleculeconcentrations. [30]
TooptimizethedynamicrangeofthebiosensorSENT0,weﬁne-
tuned the expression levels of HPTDR and sfGFP by employ-
ingribosomebindingsites(RBS)withvariousstrengths(B0030,
B0031, and B0032). By combining these RBSs in diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations,9biosensorsweredevelopedanddesignatedasSEN
T1–SEN T9 (FigureS6, Supporting Information). Speciﬁc ﬂuo-
rescenceintensitiesofthesebiosensorswereevaluatedinmedia
containing 0 and 5 g L−1 3-HP. As shown in Figure3i,ﬂ u o r e s -
cence outputs and dynamic ranges diﬀered among the biosen-
sors, indicating that modulation of HPTDR and sfGFP transla-
tion can profoundly inﬂuence biosensor performance. Notably,
SEN T6, featuring the B0032-hpTDR and B0030-sfGFP combi-
nation, achieved a dynamic range of 18.03-fold within the 0–
5gL −1 3-HPrange,signiﬁcantlysurpassingtheoriginalbiosen-
sor SEN T0 (9.66-fold;p < 0.001). We further characterized the
optimized biosensor SEN T6 over an expanded 3-HP concen-
tration range (0–10 g L−1) .A ss h o w ni nF i g u r e3j, speciﬁc ﬂu-
orescence intensity exhibited a strong linear relationship with
3-HP concentration (1–10 g L−1). The coeﬃcient of determina-
tion (R2 = 0.979) indicates that SEN T6 enables accurate quan-
titative detection within this range. The speciﬁcity of SEN T6
was assessed by measuring its response to various 3-HP struc-
tural analogs, including propionate, lactate, malonate, pyruvate,
citrate,𝛼-ketoglutarate,succinate,fumarate,malate,andoxaloac-
etate.SENT6exhibitedhighspeciﬁcityfor3-HP,withnegligible
responsestoothertestedcompounds(Figure 3k).Thisspeciﬁcity
suggests the potential of SEN T6 for precise 3-HP detection in
complex fermentation environments without interference from
othermetabolites.
2.5.Biosensor-AssistedHigh-ThroughputSelection
2.5.1. Establishment and Validation of an In Vivo High-Throughput
Platform
The aforementioned experiment preliminarily validated the fea-
sibility of the 3-HP-responsive biosensor through the external
addition of 3-HP in an in vitro setting. However, biosensor re-
sponses to target molecules can diﬀer between in vitro and in
vivo environments.[31] To further validate the in vivo applicabil-
ity of SEN T6, we integrated the biosensor within strains pro-
ducing intracellular 3-HP. For this purpose, we selected three
chassis, RAND2, RAND4, and RAND7, isolated from droplet 2,
based on their distinct 3-HP production capacities. Speciﬁcally,
RAND2 S6 produced 2.72 g L−1 of 3-HP, RAND4 S6 achieved
4.18gL −1,andRAND7S6reached5.70gL −1,categorizingthem
as low-production (LowProd), medium-production (MedProd),
and high-production (HighProd) chassis, respectively. To evalu-
atewhetherthebiosensorcoulddiﬀerentiatestrainswithvarying
3-HPproductionlevels,thebiosensormodulefromSENT6was
integrated into the plasmid p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF,g e n -
erating p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF-SENSOR (Figure4a). This
plasmid, along with pBR322-trc-KpydcW, was co-transformed
into RAND2, RAND4, and RAND7, resulting in strains HP-
LowProd,HP-MedProd,andHP-HighProd,respectively.
We ﬁrst assessed the production characteristics of HP-
LowProd,HP-MedProd,andHP-HighProdbyconductingshake-
ﬂask fermentations and measuring the ﬁnal 3-HP titers after
48 h. The results conﬁrmed that all three strains exhibited 3-
HPproductionlevelscomparabletothoseoftheircorresponding
parentalstrainslackingthebiosensormodule(Figure 2g;Figure
S7,SupportingInformation).Toevaluatewhetherthebiosensor
signals in microplates could reﬂect the ﬁnal 3-HP titers, and to
determinewhichtimepointprovidedthemostaccuratecorrela-
tion, we measured the speciﬁc ﬂuorescence intensities of these
strains at 3, 9, 15, and 21 h. It was shown that all four time
points demonstrated a positive correlation between speciﬁc ﬂu-
orescence intensities and ﬁnal 3-HP titers (FigureS8, Support-
ing Information). Notably, the 9-h measurement exhibited the
strongest correlation (R = 0.967, p < 0.0001), indicating that
biosensoroutputatthisstagecanmostaccuratelyreﬂecttheﬁnal

cultures derived from droplet 2 were prepared as electrocom-
petent cells and transformed with plasmids p15A-tac-dhaBCE-
gdrAB-glpF-SENSOR and pBR322-trc-KpydcW. The transformed
cells were then plated on modiﬁed M9 agar containing 10 g L−1
glycerol and 25μM vitamin B12. After incubation, colonies with
visibleﬂuorescencewereobserved(Figure S9b,SupportingInfor-
mation),amountingto ≈3×105 colonies.Amongthese,colonies
displayingstronggreenﬂuorescenceweremanuallyselectedfor

datestrainsandonecontrolstrain,HP0000(chassisTDcarrying

werecultivatedinmodiﬁedM9mediumcontaining10gL −1 glyc-
eroland25 μMvitaminB 12 indeep-wellplates.Speciﬁcﬂuores-
cence intensities were measured, and the relative ﬂuorescence
changes (HPn/HP0000, n = 1–1045) were subsequently calcu-
lated.Fluorescenceintensitychangesrangedfrom0.42-to2.43-
fold.Notably,29strainsexhibitedﬂuorescenceintensitychanges
exceeding twofold (Figure4d). These strains were selected for
shake-ﬂask fermentation to validate their 3-HP production ca-
pacities, with HP0000 as the control. To ensure suﬃcient sub-
strate availability during fermentation, the initial glycerol con-
centrationwasincreasedto15gL −1.Thisadjustmentwasbased
on prior observations showing that 10 g L−1 glycerol was nearly
depleted by strain TD S6 within 48 h (Figure1e), and that the
evolved strains might exhibit an enhanced capacity for glycerol
utilization under the same conditions. It was shown that 23 of
the 29 selected strains signiﬁcantly outperformed the control (p
< 0.05; Figure4e). Among these, strain HP0032 exhibited the
highest3-HPproductionof8.98gL −1,representingasigniﬁcant
increase of 74.03% compared to the 5.16 g L−1 observed in the
control(p< 0.001).Moreover,HP0032exhibiteda3-HPyieldof
0.81molmol −1 glycerol,whichwasthehighestamongalltested
strains(Figure 4e).
When comparing postselection strains (HPn series, n = 1–
1045)topreselectionstrains(HPRAND nseries,n= 1–9),anin-
creasein3-HPproductionwasobservedfollowingtheapplication
of biosensor-assisted selection (Figure4f). Preselection strains

still represents a small fraction of the initial library. As a result,
it is likely that some of the high-performing strains, potentially
surpassingHP0032,werenotcaptured.
2.6.EvaluationofBiosyntheticPerformanceandStability
To eliminate the potential metabolic burden imposed by
the biosensor element, plasmids p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF-
SENSOR and pBR322-trc-KpydcW were cured from the selected
strain HP0032 using CRISPR technology (FigureS10, Support-
ingInformation).Theresultingplasmid-freechassis,designated
TDHPT, was subsequently re-transformed with plasmids p15A-
tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpFandpBR322-trc-KpydcW,resultinginthe
creation of the biosensor-free strain TDHPT S6. Fermentation
tests were then carried out in modiﬁed M9 medium supple-
mented with 15 g L−1 glycerol, with strain TD S6 serving as the
control. As a result, strain TDHPT S6 achieved a 3-HP titer of
9.17 g L−1 and a yield of 0.80 mol mol−1 glycerol, signiﬁcantly
surpassingthecontrolstrain( p< 0.001),whichproducedatiter
of5.31gL −1 andayieldof0.63molmol −1 glycerol(Figure 4g,h).
Theseresultsrepresentimprovementsof72.69%and26.98%in
titerandyield,respectively,forTDHPTS6comparedtothecon-
trol. Meanwhile, the concentration of the byproduct acetate was
signiﬁcantly reduced in TDHPT S6 (p < 0.001), potentially con-
tributingtotheenhanced3-HPyield(Figure 4g,h).
To fully elucidate the potential of strain TDHPT S6, we per-
formedfed-batchfermentationina10-Lbioreactorfollowingthe
protocols established in our previous study.[22] The biomass of
T D H P TS 6s u r p a s s e d1 4gL−1 DCM after 48 h fermentation
(Figure 4i), nearly doubling that of the control strain TD S6
(7.56 g L−1 DCM; FigureS11, Supporting Information). The ﬁ-
nal titer of 3-HP in TDHPT S6 reached 86.30 g L−1 with a yield
of 0.82 mol mol−1 glycerol and a productivity of 1.79 g L−1 h−1
(Figure 4i). By contrast, the control strain TD S6, under identi-
cal fermentation conditions, produced only 51.60 g L−1 of 3-HP
(FigureS11,SupportingInformation).
Besides, we accessed the genetic stability of TDHPT S6
through successive passaging experiments (Figure4j). After re-
peated passaging, strain TDHPT S6 maintained robust growth
in medium containing 720 mM 3-HP (Figure4k). Meanwhile,

www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com
the 3-HP production capacity of TDHPT S6 under passaging
conditions in the absence of 3-HP was also evaluated. The re-
sults showed that the strain consistently produced≈8.5 g L−1
of 3-HP without signiﬁcant decline in production (p > 0.05),
indicating stable production performance over successive gen-
erations (Figure4k). Notably, TDHPT S6 was derived from the
parental strain HP0032 after elimination of endogenous plas-
midsandreintroductionofnewlyengineeredplasmids.Despite
extensivegeneticmodiﬁcations,TDHPTS6retainedthesuperior
traits of the parental strain HP0032. These ﬁndings underscore
the genetic stability and high-performance characteristics of the
evolvedchassisTDHPT.
2.7.TranscriptomeAnalysisRevealingtheMechanismfor
EnhancedToleranceandBiosynthesis
Toinvestigatethegeneticmechanismsunderlyingtheenhanced
tolerance and biosynthesis of 3-HP, transcriptome sequencing
was performed using RNA extracted from both the parental
strain TD S6 and the evolved strain TDHPT S6 during the log-
arithmic phase. Comparative transcriptomic proﬁling identiﬁed
246diﬀerentiallyexpressedgenes(DEGs)inTDHPTS6relative
toTDS6,applyingathresholdoffalsediscoveryrate(FDR) <0.05
and|log2 foldchange| >1(Figure S12aandTable S4,Supporting
Information). Among these, 28 genes were upregulated, while
218weredownregulated(Figure S12b,SupportingInformation).
2.7.1. The Mechanism for Enhanced 3-HP Tolerance
GeneOntology(GO)functionalannotationoftheDEGsrevealed
enrichment across multiple categories (FigureS13, Supporting
Information). Within the “Biological process” category, terms
such as “Cellular process,” “Metabolic process,” and “Response
to stimulus” were notably enriched. For the “Molecular func-
tion,” prominent terms included “binding,” “catalytic activity,”
and“transporteractivity.”Inthe“Cellularcomponent”category,
“cell,” “cell part,” and “membrane” emerged as enriched terms.
Notably, the enrichment of terms such as “Response to stimu-
lus,”“Transporteractivity,”“Cellpart”and“Membrane”appeared
to be linked to the molecular mechanisms conferring 3-HP tol-
erance. Speciﬁcally, DEGs associated with “Response to stimu-
lus” may enhance the strain’s ability to adapt to environmen-
tal changes under organic acid stress conditions by regulating
the expression of stress response pathways. The enrichment in
“Transporteractivity”suggeststhatmembranetransportsystems
couldplayakeyrolein3-HPtolerance,potentiallythroughtheac-
tiveeﬄuxof3-HPorintracellularpHregulationtomitigatetoxi-

interactions with the external environment. Functional changes
inthecellmembrane,possiblybymodulatingthecompositionof
membrane proteins and lipids, could enhance tolerance. These
ﬁndingsprovidevaluableinsightsintothemechanismsunderly-
ing3-HPtolerance.
To validate these ﬁndings, we focused on speciﬁc genes im-
plicated in 3-HP tolerance, as identiﬁed through transcriptomic
analysis and corroborated by literature review. Eleven upregu-
lated genes (glsA, yqjG, hyaC, ygdI, dps, cysT, hyaE, ybaT, yqjE,
slp,and ynaI)andsevendownregulatedgenes( ompT,ompF,btsT,
msbA,metN,metI,a n dybjJ) were selected for further functional
analysis. Overexpression of the upregulated genes or knockout
of the downregulated genes was performed in the parental TD
strain,andspeciﬁcgrowthratesoftheresultingstrainswereeval-
uatedinmodiﬁedM9mediumwithandwithout360mM3-HP.
Strains carrying the empty plasmid pTrc99a served as controls.
As shown inFigure5a, overexpression of theynaI gene yielded
a signiﬁcant 33.8% increase in speciﬁc growth rate compared
to the control under 360 mM 3-HP (p < 0.001). The YnaI pro-
tein,alow-conductancemechanosensitivechannel,hasbeenre-
portedtoplayavitalroleincellularresponsestoenvironmental

cilitate the eﬄux of small solutes and ions,[33] which could help

Under 3-HP exposure, Dps may help safeguard genomic DNA
from acid-induced damage, thereby promoting cell survival and
growth (Figure5b). Meanwhile, Slp enhances the structural in-
tegrity of the bacterial outer membrane, serving as a protective
barrier against external stressors.[35] The increased membrane
stabilityassociatedwithSlpmayhelpcounteractthemembrane-
disrupting eﬀects of 3-HP, thus augmenting tolerance to acidic
conditions (Figure 5b). Taken together, the mechanosensitive
function of YnaI, the protective role of Dps, and the structural
reinforcementprovidedbySlpmaycollectivelycontributetothe
enhanced3-HPtoleranceobservedinTDHPTS6.Nevertheless,
it is important to note that other diﬀerentially expressed genes
may also play contributory roles, and further systematic studies
willberequiredtofullyelucidatethegeneticbasisof3-HPtoler-
ance.
2.7.2. The Mechanism for Enhanced 3-HP Biosynthesis Performance
Inadditiontotheenhanced3-HPtolerance,strainTDHPTS6ex-
hibited a marked improvement in 3-HP biosynthesis eﬃciency.
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this superior pheno-
type,weperformedananalysisoftheassociatedmetabolicpath-
ways, with a focus on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) enrichment results (FigureS14a, Supporting

ingapotentialadaptivemechanismforimprovingmetabolicef-
ﬁciency.
In the metabolic network of TDHPT S6, glycerol metabolism
is funneled into three key pathways: 3-HP biosynthesis, glycol-
ysis, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Figure5c,d). Given
that the transcription levels of genes directly involved in 3-HP
biosynthesisshowednosigniﬁcantchanges(Figure 5c),ouranal-
ysis focused on genes within the “Biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites” category, particularly those linked to glycolysis and
the TCA cycle. The results revealed that thegapA gene, which
encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) in
theglycolyticpathway,wassigniﬁcantlydownregulatedinstrain
TDHPT S6 compared to the parental strain (Figure5c). The
downregulation ofgapA may help reduce carbon loss through
glycolysis,akeyadjustmentforoptimizingcarbonallocation. [36]
Previous studies have proved that moderate GapA activity is
crucial for maintaining a balance between cell growth and the
biosynthesis of target compounds.[37] In our study, although
gapA transcription was signiﬁcantly reduced in TDHPT S6, the
strainmaintainednormalgrowthandexhibitedenhanced3-HP
production eﬃciency. This observation suggests that the reduc-
tion ingapA transcription may not impair essential glycolytic
ﬂux required for biomass generation but instead redirect more
metabolicresourcestoward3-HPbiosynthesis.
Within the TCA cycle, the genesgltA (encoding citrate syn-
thase) andmdh (encoding malate dehydrogenase), which gov-
ern the initiation and terminal steps of the cycle, respectively,
were also signiﬁcantly downregulated (Figure 5c,d). Concur-
rently, genes involved in the glyoxylate shunt,aceA (encoding
isocitrate lyase) and aceB (encoding malate synthase), exhib-
ited markedly reduced transcriptional levels (Figure5c,d). This
collective downregulation may contribute to minimizing car-
bon ﬂux losses through the TCA cycle and potentially redi-
rect carbon more eﬃciently toward the 3-HP biosynthetic path-
way. To independently validate and reinforce the reliability of
the transcriptomic ﬁndings, we performed quantitative PCR
(qPCR) analysis of these key genes associated with glycolysis
and TCA cycle. This additional step was included to help ad-
dress potential concerns related to platform-speciﬁc bias or se-
quencing artifacts. The results showed that transcription lev-

els ofgapA, gltA, mdh, aceA,a n daceB were downregulated by
2.61-fold, 1.86-fold, 1.59-fold, 3.73-fold, and 2.11-fold, respec-
tively (Figure5d). These results were consistent with the tran-
scriptomicdata,furthersupportingourhypothesis.Insummary,
the downregulation of key genes in the “Biosynthesis of sec-
ondary metabolites” pathway, particularly those involved in gly-
colysis and the TCA cycle, in TDHPT S6 likely reduces car-
bon ﬂux losses during glycerol metabolism. Such metabolic re-
programming is likely to contribute to minimize unnecessary
energy expenditure and improve carbon utilization eﬃciency,
thereby promoting the high-eﬃciency synthesis of 3-HP. While
these ﬁndings indicate a potential metabolic shift toward en-
hanced 3-HP biosynthesis, the conclusions remain correlative.
In the absence of functional validation such as targeted gene
perturbationorintracellularmetaboliteproﬁling,thecausalrela-
tionshipbetweentranscriptionalchangesandtheimprovedpro-
duction phenotype cannot be deﬁnitively established. Neverthe-
less, the results oﬀer valuable hypotheses that warrant further
investigation.
3.Discussion
This study presents a reﬁned ALE strategy that overcomes the
classic trade-oﬀ between stress tolerance and biosynthetic eﬃ-
ciency in microbial production of toxic chemicals. We achieved
thisbyintroducingthreekeymodiﬁcationstoconventionalALE:
(i) using a pre-mutagenized library as the starting population
instead of a wild-type strain, (ii) performing automated high-
throughputevolutioninphysicallyisolatedmicrodroplets(MMC
system), and (iii) integrating a metabolite-responsive biosen-
sor to couple ﬂuorescence with biosynthetic performance. Tra-
ditional ALE typically requires several months of serial pas-
saging and relies on the slow accumulation of rare sponta-
neous mutations to yield tolerant mutants.[12,15] In contrast, our
strategy preloads genetic diversity through IVM, enabling se-
lection to immediately act on a broader mutational landscape.
By combining this diversity with automated parallel cultiva-
tion, we dramatically shortened the evolution timeline to un-
der 2 weeks while still obtaining mutants with superior 3-
HP tolerance and production capacity. Importantly, the built-in
biosensor accelerated identiﬁcation of “win-win” variants that
maintained high 3-HP biosynthesis alongside enhanced toler-
ance. Overall, our integrated approach markedly improves on
conventional ALE by rapidly co-optimizing two traits (toler-
ance and biosynthetic eﬃciency) rather than each trait in isola-
tion.
Mechanistically, pre-evolution mutagenesis via IVM primed
the cell population for accelerated adaptation by ensuring ad-
vantageous alleles were present from the outset. Once evolu-
tion commenced in the MMC system under escalating 3-HP
stress, cells carrying beneﬁcial mutations quickly outcompeted
others. Meanwhile, the 3-HP biosensor enabled the identiﬁca-
tionofmutantswithsuperiorbiosyntheticcapacitybylinkingin-
tracellular 3-HP levels to ﬂuorescence output, thereby allowing
strong-ﬂuorescing candidates to be preferentially retained dur-
ing screening. This dual selection addresses a common pitfall
intoleranceevolution,wheremutantsoftensurvivebydiverting
resources away from production.[17] Instead, our “win-win” se-
lection pressure favored strains striking a balance between sur-
vivalandbiosynthesis.Theoutcomewasapanelofevolved E.coli
strainsthatnotonlytolerateextremelyhigh3-HPconcentrations
(up to 720 mM) but also sustain robust 3-HP synthesis. From
a mechanistic perspective, these top-performing mutants likely
harborcombinationsofmutationsthatmitigate3-HPtoxicity(for
instance, increasing eﬄux of 3-HP) while preserving metabolic
ﬂuxthroughthe3-HPpathway.
Further comparative transcriptomic analysis of the parental
and evolved strains provided further insight into how the trade-
oﬀ between tolerance and production was resolved. Rather than
upregulating a narrow set of stress-speciﬁc genes, the tolerant
high-producing strain exhibited broad structural and metabolic
adaptations. Several genes involved in membrane structure,
transport,andstressresponsewerediﬀerentiallyexpressed,sug-
gesting that enhanced 3-HP tolerance was achieved via global
cell envelope remodeling and improved eﬄux capacity, rather
than a single protective mechanism. Notably, key genes in cen-
tralcarbonmetabolismweredownregulatedintheevolvedstrain,
including gapA, gltA,a n dmdh. This shift indicates a realloca-
tion of carbon ﬂux: by tempering glycolysis and the TCA cy-
cle, the cells diverted more resources toward the 3-HP biosyn-
thetic pathway. Similar ﬂux redistribution has been observed in
other organic acid production contexts, where reducing activ-
ity of central metabolic pathways can channel more precursors
to the target product.[36] Consistent with this, we also observed
downregulation of genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis
in the evolved strain, suggesting a deliberate simpliﬁcation of
metabolism to minimize energy dissipation. The alignment be-
tween these transcriptomic changes and the improved pheno-
type underscores the eﬀectiveness of our ALE strategy. It ap-
pears that evolution in our system selected for a more econo-
mized metabolic state that fortiﬁes cellular defenses while ef-
ﬁciently funneling carbon to 3-HP production. These ﬁndings
not only illuminate the biological basis of the “win-win” phe-
notype but can also guide rational engineering in other sys-
tems facing similar toxicity challenges. The ﬁnal evolved strain
(TDHPT S6) demonstrated exceptional performance in both
ﬂask and scaled fermentation trials, highlighting the practical
beneﬁts of our approach. In shake-ﬂask tests, TDHPT S6 grew
vigorously in the presence of 720 mM 3-HP, a concentration
that completely inhibited the parental strain. This strain also
substantially outperformed the unevolved strain in 3-HP pro-
duction. In 10-L bioreactor fed-batch fermentation, TDHPT S6
achieved a 3-HP titer of 86.3 g L−1,r e p r e s e n t i n ga n≈67% in-
crease over the parental strain under identical conditions, and
nearlydoubledtheﬁnalbiomass.Thisdramaticimprovementin
titer and growth demonstrates the strain’s superior robustness
and conﬁrms its industrial potential for 3-HP biomanufactur-
ing.
Despite these encouraging outcomes, several limitations of
ourcurrentstrategyshouldbeacknowledged.First,thegenome-
wide mutagenesis (IVM) introduces a vast number of random
mutations,someofwhichcouldinadvertentlyinﬂatethebiosen-
sorsignal(e.g.,byalteringtranscriptionalregulationorimprov-
ing sfGFP stability) without truly enhancing production. Such
false positives might cause highly ﬂuorescent clones to be se-
lected even if their 3-HP biosynthesis is not signiﬁcantly im-
proved. Although we calibrated the biosensor and conﬁrmed
product titers in shake-ﬂask tests, there remains a risk that cer-

tainbeneﬁcial-lookingmutationsmayprimarilyaﬀectthesensor
readoutratherthanthemetabolicoutput.Second,ourscreening
throughput of≈103 clones in deep-well plates is modest com-
pared to modern ultra-high-throughput techniques capable of
processing 106 to 108 variants. It is likely that we sampled only
a small fraction of the total mutant library, and some ultra-rare,
top-performing variants were missed due to practical through-
put limits and stringent selection thresholds. This trade-oﬀ be-
tween screening feasibility and coverage is an inherent chal-
lenge in manual ALE workﬂows. Third, the context-speciﬁc na-
ture of evolved mutations means that certain tolerance mecha-
nismsmightnotdirectlytranslatetootherproductionpathways
or host organisms. Furthermore, the use of multicopy plasmids

porate ultra-high-throughput single-cell screening technologies.
For example, microﬂuidic droplet sorting or ﬂuorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) could enable interrogation of mil-
lions of variant cells, greatly increasing the chance of isolating
rare superior mutants. In parallel, full automation of the evolu-

was ampliﬁed from the pTrc99a-sfGFP plasmid using primers sfGFP

ampliﬁed from the plasmid pACYCDuet-1 using primers p15A F and
CmR R. These three ampliﬁed fragments were ligated to generate the

served as a template for reverse PCR using primers backbone5 F/R,
facilitating the removal of thehpTDR gene. The resulting PCR product
was subsequently self-ligated, producing the plasmid pSEN POSI. In
a similar manner, pSEN NEGA was generated by performing reverse
PCR on pSEN T0 using primers backbone6 F/R. To construct biosen-
sor plasmids with diverse ribosome binding site (RBS) combinations,
three RBS sequences were selected from the Standard Biological Parts

trocompetent cells. The plasmids p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF-SENSOR
and pBR322-trc-KpydcW were co-transformed into the prepared compe-
tent cells via electroporation. The electroporation was performed using
a cuvette with a 1 mm gap under the following conditions: 1800 V, 200
Ω,a n d2 5μF. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h before plating
on modiﬁed M9 agar supplemented with 25μgm L−1 chloramphenicol,
50 μgm L−1 kanamycin, 10 g L−1 glycerol, and 25μM vitamin B12.T h e

Elimination of Plasmids in Strain HP0032: The tool plasmid pELIMI-
p15A was transformed into strain HP0032, and the resulting strain was
inducedwith0.5mMIPTGat30 °Cand220rpmfor12htocuretheplas-
mid p15A-tac-dhaBCE-gdrAB-glpF-SENSOR. The curing of pELIMI-p15A
was achieved by incubation at 42°C for 8 h, exploiting the temperature-

Transcriptome Analysis and qPCR Veriﬁcations: The initial parental
strain, TD S6, and the evolved strain, TDHPT S6, were plated on LB agar.
Single colonies were selected and inoculated into modiﬁed M9 medium
supplemented with 10 g L−1 glycerol. Cultures were incubated at 37°C
and 220 rpm until reaching the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 = 1.0
± 0.05). Cells were harvested, washed twice with potassium phosphate
buﬀer(100mM,pH7.0),andﬂash-frozeninliquidnitrogen.
The samples were packaged in a foam-insulated container with dry
ice and dispatched to Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Guangzhou,
China).forRNAextractionandsequencinganalysis.Thetranscriptomese-

FlaskandBioreactorFermentationfor3-HPProduction : For shake-ﬂask
scale production of 3-HP, single colonies of engineered strains were
picked up and cultured in LB medium at 37°C and 220 rpm for 12 h.
The resulting cultivation was inoculated at 1% (v/v) ratio into a 250 mL-
ﬂask containing 50 mL modiﬁed M9 medium. The medium composition
included 1 g L−1 yeast extract, 0.8 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 2 g L−1 NH4Cl,
2gL −1 NaCl, potassium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, pH 7.0), 5μMv i t a -
min B12, and variable concentrations of glycerol. The shake-ﬂask fermen-
tationswereconductedat37 °Cand220rpm.
For fed-batch fermentation, the medium contained 5 g L−1 yeast
extract, 0.8 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 2 g L−1 NH4Cl, 2 g L−1 NaCl, a
potassium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, pH 7.0), 50μM vitamin B12,
6gL −1 glucose, 40 g L−1 glycerol, 5 mL L−1 trace metal solution,
and 0.1% (v/v) antifoaming agent. Trace metal solution: 10 g L −1
FeSO4·7H2O,2.2gL −1 ZnSO4·7H2O,2gL −1 CaCl2,1gL −1 CuSO4·5H2O,

Na2B4O7·10H2O, and0.5 M HCl.[22] The fermentation wasperformed in
a 10 L bioreactor with a working volume of 4 L. Freshly cultivated seed
culture was inoculated at 10% (v/v) into the fermentation medium. Ini-
tial fermentation parameters were set as follows: temperature at 37°C,
stirringrateat500rpm,andanaerationrateof1vvm.ThepHwasmain-
