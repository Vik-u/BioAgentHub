The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant eﬀects of Cymbopogon citratus, citral, and green-synthesized silver
nanoparticles derived from the extract in mitigating oxidative stress–induced liver damage in diabetes mellitus. Seventy rats
were randomly split into seven groups: a control group of healthy rats received normal saline, a cosolvent group of Type 2
diabetics received olive oil, a negative control group of Type 2 diabetics, and groups of diabetic rats receiving various
treatments: metformin (100 mg/kg),Cymbopogon citratus extract (30 mg/kg), citral (30 mg/kg), and green-synthesized silver
nanoparticles (30 mg/kg). Type 2 diabetes was induced in rats using 90 mg/kg of nicotinamide and 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin.
After 6 weeks, the rats were anesthetized to extract blood samples. The serum levels of the liver function test (serum glutamic–
oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic–pyruvic transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase) were measured. They were then
euthanized by CO 2 inhalation. Liver tissue was used to investigate histopathology, antioxidant activity, and Nrf2 gene
expression. In the diabetes group, liver function tests increased, while TAC decreased and MDA increased (p <0 05). The
expression of the Nrf2 gene decreased compared to the control group (p <0 05). In the treatment groups, the liver function
tests and MDA decreased, while TAC and the expression of the Nrf2 gene increased compared to the Type 2 diabetes group
(p <0 05). The histopathological examination showed a return to normal condition. The study found that Cymbopogon
citratus, speciﬁcally citral and green-synthesized silver nanoparticles, eﬀectively mitigated oxidative stress–induced liver damage
in diabetes.

1. Introduction
With 425 million individuals aﬀected in 2015 and over 590
million diabetics projected by 2035, diabetes mellitus is one
of the fastest growing diseases in the world [1]. Diabetes is
characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and impaired
metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins due to
defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both [2]. It is
typically diagnosed by hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in
diabetes produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free rad-
icals, which can lead to lipid peroxidation, insulin resistance,
tissue damage, and complications such as retinopathy, car-
diomyopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy [3]. Abnor-
mally high concentrations of free radicals, combined with a
decline in antioxidant defense systems, can damage cell
organelles and enzymes, increase lipid peroxidation, and
result in insulin resistance [4]. One of the primary organs
susceptible to oxidative stress caused by hyperglycemia is
the liver, which consists of insulin-sensitive tissues [5].

in Type 2 diabetes, exacerbated by oxidative stress and
abnormal inﬂammatory signals [6–8]. The Nrf2 signaling
pathway plays a crucial role in delaying the onset of diabetes
and responding to oxidative stress [9]. Due to their minimal
toxicity and few side eﬀects, herbal remedies and botanical
ingredients have long been recognized as primary sources
of potent antidiabetic and hypoglycemic medications [9,
10]. Cymbopogon citratus, or lemongrass, is a plant known
for its hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, blood
pressure–lowering, and liver detoxiﬁcation properties [11].
Because of its anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant qualities,
citral, the primary component of theCymbopogon citratus
plant, serves as a supplemental treatment for diabetic
patients. It inﬂuences blood serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α,
haptoglobin, andα2 macroglobulin, among other inﬂamma-
tory markers [12]. The production of these compounds as
nanoparticles enhances their biological activities, prolongs
their stability, inhibits their excretion, and reduces the likeli-
hood of chemical degradation [13, 14]. Green nanoparticles
exhibit a variety of therapeutic eﬀects, including antioxidant,
anticancer, and wound healing properties [15–17].
The goal of this study is to justify and investigate the
therapeutic potential of citral,Cymbopogon citratus extract,
and their green-synthesized silver nanoparticles in mitigat-
ing diabetes-induced oxidative stress and in ﬂammation,
with a particular focus on liver dysfunction in diabetic rats.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals.Shiraz University of Medical Sciences procured
70 healthy male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250± 50 g
and aged 1.5 months. Upon moving the animals to the veter-
inary faculty’s animal house, they were maintained at a tem-
perature of 22
°C ± 1°C, a humidity of 50%, and 12 h of light
and darkness. They had free access to sanitary water and pel-
leted food. The study commenced 1 week after the transfer,
giving the rats time to adapt to their new environment. All
experimental procedures involving laboratory animals were
conducted in accordance with the biological ethics regula-
tions issued by Shiraz University’s research vice-chancellor.
2.2. Aqueous Extraction Preparation. Lemongrass was col-
lected from Fars Province, Iran, and veriﬁed by the Agricul-
tural Faculty of Shiraz University. The leaves were washed
with distilled water and air-dried in a dark environment.
Once dried, the leaves were cut into smaller pieces, mixed
with distilled water in a 1:8 ratio, and boiled for 30 min.
The resulting solution wasﬁltered using Whatman No. 1ﬁl-
ter paper and then freeze-dried to produce a powder.
2.3. Lemongrass Extract Silver Nanoparticle Synthesis.These
particles were synthesized using the silver nitrate bioreduc-
tion method through Cymbopogon citratus extract, as per
Faraji et al.’s previous study [18]. Lemongrass-synthesized
silver nanoparticles (LE-AgNPs) were examined by DLS
and transmission electron microscopy to be 68.54 and
36.24 nm, respectively. They were spherical in shape as
observed by transmission electron microscopy [18].
2.4. Diabetes Induction. Nicotinamide (NA) (90 mg/kg, ip,
Sigma, Germany) was injected, and 15 min later, animals
received 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) (ip, Sigma, Ger-
many) intraperitoneally. After 3 days, blood glucose
was measured through the tail vein. The rats were classiﬁed
as diabetics if their blood glucose levels exceeded 250 mg/dL
[19].
2.5. Experimental Design.The rats were randomly assigned
to seven groups, each containing 10 individuals.
Healthy control group: No treatment intervention was
implemented in this group.
Negative control group: This group received STZ along
with NA as a diabetic control group. Animals in this group
ﬁrst received an intraperitoneal injection of 90 mg/kg of
NA, followed by 65 mg/kg of STZ 15 min later. After 3 days,
blood glucose was measured through the tail vein. The rats
were classiﬁed as diabetics if their blood glucose levels
exceeded 250 mg/dL [19].
Cosolvent control group: The diabetic rats in this group
were administered 1 mL of olive oil (as a citral solvent) by
gavage, starting from the beginning of the daily treatment
until the study’s conclusion.
Metformin treatment: For 6 weeks, diabetic rats
were administered a daily dose of 100 mg/kg BW of met-
formin (Sigma, Germany) in aqueous suspension via
gavage [20].
Treatment 1: For 6 weeks, diabetic rats were adminis-
tered a daily dose of 30 mg/kg BW of citral (Sigma, Ger-
many) dissolved in olive oil via gavage [3].
Treatment 2: This group of diabetic animals was admin-
istered a daily oral dose of 30 mg/kg BW ofCymbopogon
citratus extract in aqueous suspension for 6 weeks [21].
Treatment 3: Diabetic animals in this group were admin-
istered a daily dose of 30 mg/kg BW of LE-AgNP in aqueous
suspension via gavage for 6 weeks [22].
The rats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg,
ip) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, ip) for blood sampling following
the conclusion of the 6-week experiment. Following this,
they were euthanized with carbon dioxide gas in the animal
house of the Department of Basic Sciences at the Faculty of
Veterinary Medicine, and liver tissue samples were obtained.
A portion of the tissue samples was immersed in formalin
for histomorphometry analysis, while another portion was
stored in a−80
°C freezer to assess oxidative stress and gene
expression.
2.6. Biochemical Factor Measurement. A 5-cc syringe was
employed to collect blood serum from the heart. Blood
serum was extracted by centrifuging the blood sample at
3000 rpm for 10 min. After that, the blood serum was kept
in a freezer at−20
°C for a week to conduct further examina-
tion. Then, blood serum was tested for biochemical markers
of liver function, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum
glutamic–pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and serum gluta-
mic–oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), using commercial
kits (Pars Azmoon Co., Tehran, Iran) and a biochemical
auto-analyzer (Alpha Classic AT++, Sanjesh, Iran).

2.7. Histopathological Investigations.The liver tissue sample
was immersed in a 10% formalin solution for histopatholo-
gical analysis. Through a standard procedure, tissue sections
were made from samplesﬁxed in 10% formalin for micro-
scope examination. The hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) method
was then employed to stain the sections. The histological
structure of the liver was analyzed and compared in various
groups using an optical microscope (Olympus E450, Japan).
2.8. Antioxidant Capacity Evaluation. The initial step in
homogenizing liver tissue was to remove 100 mg using a dig-
ital scale and freeze it with liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the
tissue was homogenized in a mortar with 1 mL of
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS). It is essential to mention
that all procedures were executed on ice. The homogenized
tissue was put into a microtube and centrifuged for 10 min
at 6000 rpm in a refrigerator-cooled centrifuge at 6 °C.
Finally, the supernatant was collected. The malondialdehyde
(MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were
then measured by a commercial kit (Zelbio Co., Germany)
in the supernatant.
2.9. Measurement of Nrf2 Gene Expression.Total RNA was
extracted from liver tissues using the FavorPrep Tissue Total
RNA Mini Kit (FAVORGEN Biotech Corporation, Taiwan).
To assess the quality of the extracted RNA, 5μL was electro-
phoresed on an agarose gel, and its absorbance was measured
at 260 nm using a Thermo ScientiﬁcN a n o D r o pL i t eS p e c t r o -
photometer. Purity was conﬁrmed with a ratio of 1.8–2.0 at
A260/A280. Subsequently, the total RNA was converted into
cDNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States)
and analyzed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). All primers were designed using Allele
IDv7.8 software. The following primers were employed: For
Nrf2, the forward primer is 5′-CACATCCAGACAGACA
CCAGTC-3′, and the reverse primer is 5′-CTACAAATG
GGAATGTCTCTGC-3′. The TBP (TATA-binding protein)
transcript was used as an internal control, with the forward
primer 5 ′-GCGGGGTCATGAAATCCAGT-3′ and the
reverse primer 5 ′-AGTGATGTGGGGACAAAACGA-3′.
The quantities of the target and housekeeping genes (Nrf2
and TBP) were determined using a comparative cycle thresh-
old (Ct) method. The gene expression level was determined
using the 2−ΔΔCt formula.
2.10. Data Statistical Analysis.The mean± standard error of
the mean (SEM) was used to report the data. The ANOVA
statistical test, Tukey’s HSD post hoc test, and GraphPad
Prism Version 10.1 software were used to analyze the
research data statistically. With an accuracy ofp ≤ 0 05,a
statistical diﬀerence was deemed signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Liver Function Serum Biochemical Parameters
3.1.1. Measurement of SGOT Activity.The Type 2 diabetes
group had serum levels of SGOT of 344 1±1 3 09 U/L,
which were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the control
group (67 87 ± 1195 U/L) (p <0 0001). SGOT concentra-
tions were 186 9±5 59, 150 3±1 2 81, 169 0±1 73, and
141 6±3 48 U/L in the metformin, Cymbopogon citratus
extract, citral, and LE-AgNP treatment groups, respectively.
They decreased signiﬁcantly compared to the Type 2 diabe-
tes group (p <0 0001) and were comparable to the control
group. The nanoparticle treatment group exhibited the low-
est level of blood SGOT among the treatment groups; how-
ever, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed between the
treatment groups (p >0 05) (Figure 1).
3.1.2. Measurement of SGPT Activity.The serum SGPT level
of the Type 2 diabetic group was340 3±2 9 83 U/L, which
was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the control group
(52 92 ± 646 U/L) (p <0 0001). The SGPT concentrations
in the groups treated with metformin,Cymbopogon citratus
extract, citral, and LE-AgNP were 109 2±6 46, 101 2±
2 44, 104 0±5 56, and 98 35 ± 162 U/L, respectively. The
results indicated that they were signi ﬁcantly lower than
those of the Type 2 diabetes group (p <0 0001) and were
comparable to those of the control group. The nanoparticle
treatment group exhibited the lowest level of blood SGPT
among the treatment groups; however, no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence was observed between the treatment groups (p >0 05)
(Figure 2).
3.1.3. Serum ALP Activity.The ALP serum level of the Type
2 diabetic group increased signiﬁcantly by 395% compared
to the control group (p <0 0001). Compared to the Type 2
diabetes group, the ALP concentrations in the metformin,
Cymbopogon citratusextract, citral, and LE-AgNP treatment
groups were signiﬁcantly reduced by 69%, 66%, 67%, and
69%, respectively (p <0 0001), and were comparable to the
control group. The metformin treatment group exhibited
the lowest blood ALP level among the treatment groups;
however, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed
between the treatment groups (p >0 05) (Figure 3).
3.2. Determining the Antioxidant Activity of Liver Tissue
3.2.1. Antioxidant Parameters in Liver Tissue
3.2.1.1. TAC. The tissue TAC level in the Type 2 diabetic
group was 26 48 ± 057 μM/100 mg tissue, indicating a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in comparison to the control group
(57 99 ± 256 μM/100 mg tissue) (p <0 0001). TAC concen-
trations were 35 94 ± 118, 41 07 ± 065, 36 02 ± 100, and
28 47 ± 155 μM/100 mg tissue in the metformin,Cymbopo-
gon citratus extract, citral, and LE-AgNP treatment groups,
respectively. They signiﬁcantly increased and approached
the control group compared to the group with Type 2 diabe-
tes. The LE-AgNP treatment group exhibited the highest
levels of tissue TAC among the treatment groups; however,
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed between the treatment
groups (p >0 05) (Figure 4a).
3.2.1.2. MDA.Compared to the control group (184 8±6 24
nM/100 mg tissue), the tissue MDA levels in the Type 2 dia-
betic group were signiﬁcantly higher at542 6±3 98 24nM/
3BioMed Research International
100 mg tissue (p <0 0001). MDA concentration values were
424 4±2 3 07, 281 9±1 5 32, 335 9±2 5 03, and 218 9±
6 19 24nM/100 mg tissue in the metformin, citral,Cymbopo-
gon citratus extract, and LE-AgNP, respectively. Compared
to the Type 2 diabetes group, they experienced a signiﬁcant
decrease (p <0 0001) and converged with the control group.
The LE-AgNP treatment group experienced the lowest tissue
MDA level among the treatment groups; however, no statis-
tically signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed between the treat-
ment groups (p >0 05) (Figure 4b).
3.3. Nrf2 Gene Expression in Liver Tissue.The Type 2 diabe-
tes group had a tissue Nrf2 gene expression level of0 58 ±
0 14. A signiﬁcant decrease was observed in contrast to the
control group (0 1±0 31). The Nrf2 gene expression levels
were 1 14 ± 016, 1 15 ± 025, 1 29 ± 027, and 1 04 ± 020
in the metformin, Cymbopogon citratus extract, citral, and
LE-AgNP treatment groups, respectively. Compared to the
Type 2 diabetes group, they increased, but the diﬀerence
was not statistically signiﬁcant (p > 0.05) and was compara-
ble to the control group. Although the Nrf2 gene expression
associated with the LE-AgNP was more similar to that of the
control group in the treatment groups, no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence was observed between the treatment groups (p >0 05)
(Figure 5).
3.4. Liver Tissue Histopathological Results
3.4.1. Healthy Control Group.Within the typical structure of
the histological architecture, liver cells in the form of cell
plates with a thickness of one or two cells, separated by sinu-
soids, were present in the histological sections of rats’livers
from the healthy control group. No signs of necrosis or cel-
lular changes suggested pathological lesions, such as the

development of cytoplasmic vacuoles or cell death. No
inﬂammatory cell accumulation was seen in the liver paren-
chyma, including neutrophils or lymphocytes, hemorrhage,
ﬁbrosis, or vascular dilatation with sinusoids (Figure 6A).
3.4.2. Solvent Group.The histopathological examination of
the liver tissue sections associated with the solvent group
revealed the accumulation of mononuclear inﬂammatory
cells and focal necrosis of liver cells. However, the liver
parenchyma exhibited no ﬁbrosis or hemorrhage
(Figure 6B).
3.4.3. Type 2 Diabetes Group.In this group of rats, the cyto-
plasm of the liver cell tissue section exhibited severe hyper-
emia of the liver vessels and background granular changes
(Figure 6C).
3.4.4. Metformin Treatment Group.The rats in this group
exhibited hyperemia in their histological liver sections.
Within the lobular structure of the liver, one or two fully
functional nuclei, shaped like cell plates, can be found radi-
ally around the central vein and in the center of the cell.
The cytoplasmic background changes, and the foci showing
the presence of in ﬂammatory cells were not observed
(Figure 6D).
3.4.5. Cymbopogon citratus Extract Treatment Group.The
liver cells of the rats in the essential oil treatment group
exhibited uniform eosinophilic cytoplasm, with one or two
complete healthy nuclei located in the center of the cell.
They are arranged radially around the central vein of the
liver’s lobular structure in cell plates, each with a thickness
of one or two cells, and are divided by sinusoids. There
was no evidence of cell swelling, degeneration or vacuole for-
mation, necrosis, cell death, or an increase inﬁbrous con-
nective tissue, inﬂammatory cells, or vascular lesions in the
liver tissue sections associated with this group (Figure 6E).

vascular lesions such as hyperemia, hemorrhage, andﬁbro-
sis, were not observed in the liver parenchyma during the
histopathological examinations of the tissue sections of this
group (Figure 6F).
3.4.7. Nanoparticle-Treated Group.The histological sections
of the liver associated with this group did not exhibit any
pathological changes, including hepatocellular necrosis,
inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells, hemorrhage, or ﬁbrosis
in the liver parenchyma. However, the liver tissue sections
of the rats in this group exhibited signs of vascular hyper-
emia (Figure 6G).
4. Discussion
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most rapidly
expanding chronic diseases globally, with projections esti-
mating it will aﬀect 693 million adults by 2045. It results
from insulin resistance and/or inadequate insulin secretion
and leads to persistent hyperglycemia, a condition that trig-
gers oxidative stress through mechanisms such as excessive
mitochondrial ROS generation and NADPH oxidase activa-
tion [23, 24]. This oxidative stress is a critical factor contrib-
uting to complications, including liver injury [25].
The liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis, and
oxidative stress directly aﬀects its function. In the current
study, rats with T2DM exhibited elevated MDA levels and
decreased TAC, conﬁrming the presence of oxidative stress.
Concurrently, increased serum levels of liver enzyme-
s— ALP, SGPT, and SGOT— indicated hepatic injury. These
ﬁndings align with prior studies showing that oxidative
stress in diabetes impairs liver function and leads to hepato-
cellular damage [26–28].
Histopathological analyses of diabetic liver tissue con-
ﬁrmed liver damage, showing hyperemia, necrosis, and
inﬂammatory inﬁltration. These results were consistent with
those reported by Aghemo et al. and Ferro et al., where
chronic oxidative stress led to liver inﬂammation, hepatic
stellate cell activation, andﬁbrosis [29, 30]. Naseri et al. fur-
ther correlated elevated liver enzymes and oxidative markers
in liver-injured diabetic rats [31]. Similarly, Balamash et al.
conﬁrmed that elevated ALP, SGOT, and SGPT levels in dia-
betic rats are associated with liver apoptosis and necro-
sis [32].
The antioxidant defense system, including enzymes like
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathi-
one peroxidase, plays a crucial role in neutralizing ROS.
Nrf2, a transcription factor, regulates these antioxidant
genes. However, hyperglycemia suppresses Nrf2 activity,
reducing antioxidant defenses and exacerbating oxidative
stress [33–36]. In the present study, Nrf2 gene expression
was reduced in diabetic rats, conﬁrming its suppression in
diabetes-induced oxidative conditions.
Metformin, the frontline therapy for T2DM, primarily
lowers blood glucose by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis
and glycogenolysis [37, 38]. Additionally, it has been
reported to enhance antioxidant defenses. Studies by Bala-
mash et al., Wang et al., and Yasmin et al. con ﬁrmed

metformin’s ability to restore antioxidant enzyme levels and
reduce liver enzyme markers [32, 39, 40]. However, while
metformin demonstrated e ﬃcacy in reducing oxidative
stress and liver enzyme levels, its eﬀects were found to be less
pronounced compared to natural antioxidant treatments in
this study.
Antioxidants from natural sources— such as vitamins E
and C, alpha-lipoic acid, and selenium— have been shown
to ameliorate oxidative stress in diabetes [41–43]. In partic-
ular, plant-based antioxidants hold therapeutic promise.
Cymbopogon citratus(lemongrass) is rich inﬂavonoids and
phenolic compounds, contributing to its potent antioxidant
activity. Essential oils and bioactive compounds from this
plant, especially citral, have shown hypoglycemic and hepa-
toprotective eﬀects [44, 45].
In this study, Cymbopogon citratus extract, its major
compound citral, and its green-synthesized silver nanopar-
ticles were used to treat diabetic rats. The treatment
groups showed reduced MDA and elevated TAC levels,
indicating alleviation of oxidative stress. Biochemical
markers (ALP, SGOT, and SGPT) were also signiﬁcantly
lowered, suggesting hepatic protection. These ﬁndings are
supported by previous studies: Guleria and Sehgal demon-
strated lemongrass’s ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation
and scavenge free radicals [46]. Somparn et al. showed that
lemongrass extract improves antioxidant enzyme levels and
decreases liver enzyme markers [47]. Saenthaweesuk et al.
reported similar results, showing that the extract mitigates
paracetamol-induced liver injury via antioxidant
action [48].
Citral, the main component ofCymbopogon citratus, has
also been validated for its hepatoprotective eﬀects. Júnior
et al. reported decreased SGPT and SGOT levels in diabetic
rats treated with citral, indicating reduced oxidative liver
injury [49]. Akinbosola et al. observed that both citral and
lemongrass oil increased liver antioxidant enzymes (SOD
and CAT) and reduced liver enzyme markers, emphasizing
their protective eﬀects [50].
Furthermore, the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles
using plant extracts has emerged as a promising, eco-
friendly, and eﬀective therapeutic approach. These nanopar-
ticles exhibit enhanced biological activity due to their
increased surface area [51]. Al-Salmi et al. demonstrated
the superior antioxidant eﬀect of green-synthesized nano-
particles compared to green tea extract alone, as indicated
by normalized MDA levels [52]. In the present study, nano-
particles synthesized from Cymbopogon citratus exhibited
the most potent therapeutic eﬀect among the tested treat-
ments, reducing MDA and liver enzyme markers more eﬀec-
tively than the extract or citral alone.
Hammam et al. conﬁrmed the safety and antioxidant
eﬃcacy of green-synthesized nanoparticles fromCymbopo-
gon citratus essential oil. They found that these nanoparti-
cles reduced serum MDA and liver enzyme levels without
inducing cytotoxicity [53]. Similarly, Rahimi et al. and
Rajappa et al. demonstrated that natural antioxidants and
their nanoparticle forms activate Nrf2 gene expression more
eﬀectively than conventional drugs, providing better protec-
tion against oxidative damage [54–56].
This study also found that treatment withCymbopogon
citratus, citral, and their green-synthesized nanoparticles
increased Nrf2 gene expression, suggesting that their antiox-
idant properties may be mediated via activation of this path-
way. This is consistent with ﬁndings by Gandhi, who
highlighted the potential of citral in modulating the Nrf2 sig-
naling pathway in diabetes [57].
A comparative analysis of all treatments revealed that
green-synthesized nanoparticles provided the most potent
hepatoprotective and antioxidant eﬀects, followed byCym-
bopogon citratusextract, citral, and, lastly, metformin. These
ﬁndings suggest that while metformin remains a valuable
antidiabetic drug, plant-derived compounds — particularly
in nanoparticle form — may o ﬀer enhanced therapeutic
eﬀects by targeting oxidative stress and protecting hepatic
tissues.
Despite these promising results, several limitations must
be acknowledged. The current study was conducted on rats,
and while they are widely accepted as a model for diabetes
research, the ﬁndings cannot be directly extrapolated to
humans. Additionally, the long-term eﬀects and safety of sil-
ver nanoparticles in biological systems remain underex-
plored. Hence, further clinical studies and long-term
toxicological assessments are needed.
Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis
of T2DM and its hepatic complications.Cymbopogon citra-
tus, citral, and their green-synthesized nanoparticles oﬀer
signiﬁcant antioxidant and hepatoprotective e ﬀects by
reducing oxidative biomarkers, normalizing liver enzymes,
and upregulating Nrf2 expression. These natural com-
pounds, especially in nanoparticle form, have the potential
to complement or even surpass standard pharmacotherapy
in managing diabetes-induced hepatic injury. This study
used only a rat model, limiting human applicability. Short-
term treatment and a narrow focus on markers restrict
understanding of long-term e ﬀects and broader mecha-
nisms. Molecular and histological analyses were limited,
and glycemic control was not assessed. Future studies should
expand these aspects and include dose–response evaluations.
5. Conclusion
This study shows that diabetes causes liver oxidative stress,
marked by increased MDA, decreased TAC, elevated liver
enzymes, and lowered Nrf2 expression. Treatments with
Cymbopogon citratus extract, citral, and their green-
synthesized silver nanoparticles (LE-AgNPs) reduced oxida-
tive stress, improved antioxidant levels, normalized liver
enzymes, and boosted Nrf2 expression. Theseﬁndings high-
light their potential as natural, complementary therapies for
protecting liver function in diabetes.
