ABSTRACT
Purpose: In recent years, the rising prevalence of metabolic disorders and liver dysfunc -
tion due to sedentary lifestyles and poor nutrition has become a growing health con -
cern. This study investigates the effects of small sided football (SSF) and date seed 
powder (DSP) supplementation on liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the ALT/AST ratio 
in inactive college subjects.
Methods: Fifteen inactive male dormitory residents aged 21.53 ± 1.88 years (height: 
174.46 ± 4.88 cm, weight: 67.67 ± 11.05 kg), who exclusively consumed university cafe -
teria meals, participated in two football matches. Between these matches, they con -
sumed 0.25 g/kg of body weight of DSP thrice weekly for four weeks. Blood samples and 
anthropometric indices were collected before and after each game.
Results: The results indicated that SSF alone led to a reduction in ALT, ALP, and the ALT/ 
AST ratio, while increasing AST levels ( p > 0.05). Furthermore, it was observed that 
supplementation with DSP resulted in an increase in ALT, AST ( p = 0.019), and ALP, 
along with a decrease in the ALT/AST ratio. Additionally, the findings revealed that SSF 
following one month of DSP supplementation led to an increase in ALT, AST ( p = 0.002), 
and ALP ( p = 0.035), while decreasing the ALT/AST ratio.
Conclusions: Four weeks of supplementation with DSP and SSF can improve liver 
enzyme levels, such as ALT, AST, and ALP, which indicate physiological adaptation to 
exercise and the potential impact of supplements on liver metabolism.

1. Introduction
Modern lifestyles pose a significant risk of increasing sedentary behavior, which activates pathophysiological 
pathways and elevates the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Since the 1970s, global health 
organizations have sought to promote physical activity [ 1 ]; however, data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that only half of adults engage in sufficient physical activity, with 
participation rates declining with age [ 2 ]. Medical studies highlight numerous benefits of physical activity, 
including reduced mortality, improved quality of life, enhanced bone and brain health, reduced anxiety, 
prevention of metabolic disorders, and improved liver function [ 1 , 3–5 ]. Nevertheless, the importance of 
physical activity remains inadequately understood within society [ 1 ].
Football is widely recognized as an effective means of improving cardiovascular, metabolic, and muscu -
loskeletal fitness [ 6 ], which has led to the emergence of the concept of “Football as Medicine” in the scientific 
literature [ 7 ]. However, when played at high intensity, football may negatively impact various organs, 
including the liver, by inducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [ 8 , 9 ]. Proper nutrition and dietary 
supplementation, when following scientific protocols, can help prevent nutritional deficiencies, provide 
energy, and enhance athletic performance. Consequently, the development of evidence-based nutritional 
strategies to improve health and athletic performance, particularly in football, has gained significant 
attention [ 10 ].

Date seed is considered a dietary supplement and has gained attention as a functional food due 
to its bioactive compounds. Depending on the variety and quality of the date fruit, the seed 
constitutes approximately 6–15% of its total weight and contains fiber, lipids, proteins, antioxidants, 
flavonoids, vitamins, and minerals [ 11 ]. Additionally, its polyphenols, such as catechin and procya -
nidin, exhibit antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties [ 12 , 13 ]. Given these attributes, date 
seed supplementation may serve as an effective strategy for improving overall health [ 14 ]. Studies 
have demonstrated that date seed supplementation in physically active individuals and athletes 
engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) reduces oxidative stress and enhances performance 
[ 15 ]. Moreover, the combined consumption of date seed powder (DSP) and HIIT has been shown to 
mitigate inflammation and muscle damage [ 16 ]. However, some studies have reported varying 
effects of different training protocols on liver function, highlighting the need for further investiga -
tion [ 17 ].
Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the potential of plant-based compounds to modulate 
metabolic health markers, including liver enzymes. For instance, Bahari et al. demonstrated that pome -
granate supplementation significantly improves lipid profiles, supporting the role of natural polyphenols 
in biochemical regulation [ 18 ]. Similarly, nut-derived bioactives have been shown to reduce inflammation 
and metabolic dysregulation in chronic diseases, suggesting that date seeds, which are rich in fiber and 
antioxidants, may exert similar functional effects [ 19 ]. Additional evidence from randomized controlled 
trials (RCT) indicates that natural antioxidants such as melatonin, propolis, and French maritime pine bark 
extract can positively influence oxidative stress, inflammation, and hepatic biomarkers [ 20 , 21 ]. These 
findings collectively support the hypothesis that date seed supplementation may modulate liver enzyme 
responses through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Moreover, the cardiometabolic ben -
efits of fruit-derived compounds, as highlighted in Bahari et al.‘s 2024 meta-analysis on blood pressure, 
further underscore the health-promoting potential of phytochemicals [ 22 ]. In this context, the current 
study’s combination of DSP supplementation with small-sided football – a known stimulus for metabolic 
adaptation – offers a novel approach to improving liver health in inactive individuals.
In recent decades, the prevalence of metabolic disorders, obesity, and liver dysfunction has risen 
significantly, largely due to sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy dietary patterns – an issue particularly 
pronounced among inactive college students engaged in predominantly sedentary academic rou -
tines. Within context, football, as a dynamic, group-based, and time-efficient physical activity, holds 
promise for enhancing overall health and athletic performance. Simultaneously, DSP, a functional 
plant-based supplement rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, may beneficially 
modulate glycemic control, lipid metabolism, liver function, and exercise-induced muscle damage. 
While prior studies investigating the effects of physical activity and dietary supplements on health, no 
research has have independently examined the health effects of either physical activity or dietary 
supplementation, the novelty of the present study lies in its integrative approach, assessing for the 
first time the synergistic impact of DSP supplementation and small-sided football (SSF) on liver 
enzyme responses – specifically aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) – in an understudied and at-risk population. This dual-intervention 
strategy not only offers a practical and accessible model for promoting hepatic health but also 
provides new insights into the interplay between antioxidant-rich supplementation and exercise- 
induced physiological adaptations.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ethical approval
This study was conducted at the Persian Gulf University of Bushehr, adhering to the ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Before participation, all volunteers were provided with 
a comprehensive explanation of the study protocol and signed an informed consent form. The study 
protocol received approval from the Ethics Committee of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences (IR. 
BPUMS.REC.1403.267).

2.2. Participants
The sample size of this interventional study was calculated before the study using G*Power version 3.1, 
based on a Cohen’s f effect size of 1.05, an alpha level of 0.05, and a statistical power of 0.95. After accounting 
for a 10% anticipated dropout rate, the required sample size was determined to be 15 participants. This 
calculation ensured sufficient power to detect significant effects in the context of our design.Between 
November and December 2024, fifteen inactive male undergraduate students with prior experience in 
playing football voluntarily participated in this study. The study protocol adhered to the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. The inclusion criteria were as follows: being in good 
health, having familiarity and experience with football, not engaging in regular physical activity, residing in 
dormitories, consuming three cooked meals provided by the university cafeteria, and willingness to parti -
cipate in the study. Although participants may have come from different socio-economic backgrounds, their 
shared residential setting and uniform dietary conditions helped ensure a relatively homogeneous socio- 
economic status and nutritional intake. These controlled conditions minimized potential confounding effects 
related to socio-economic disparities and dietary variability. Consequently, a detailed food intake chart was 
not generated, as all participants followed the same dietary regimen with no individual deviations. The 
exclusion criteria included a history of morphological or cardiovascular disorders, significant orthopedic 
issues, musculoskeletal injuries, consumption of ergogenic dietary supplements (e.g. creatine, β-hydroxy-β- 
methylbutyrate, etc.), various antioxidants, anabolic/catabolic hormones (e.g. androstenedione, dehydroe -
piandrosterone, etc.), antacids, antibiotics, antidiarrheal and anti-inflammatory medications, smoking, and 
adherence to a special or restricted diet within six months before the study.
2.3. Experimental design
After the recruitment process and obtaining written informed consent, all participants ( n = 15) were enrolled in 
a single-group, repeated-measures experimental design. The study included two exercise trials (SSF matches), 
conducted before and after a one-month dietary supplementation phase. To minimize confounding variables, 
participants were instructed to abstain from any vigorous physical activity for at least 48 hours prior to each 
exercise session. On the first experimental day, following an overnight fast (beginning at midnight), baseline 
blood samples were collected at 8:00 AM. Anthropometric measurements, including height and weight, were 
taken using a calibrated scale and stadiometer (Seca Co., Germany). Participants were then provided with 
a standardized breakfast (sandwich with bread, cheese, tomato, and cucumber), followed by participation in 
an SSF match. Immediately after the match, post-exercise blood samples were collected.
Subsequently, after a 24-hour rest period, participants underwent a one-month supplementation protocol 
with DSP, administered three times per week according to a standardized dosage. After completing the 
supplementation period and ensuring a 24-hour washout period following the final DSP dose, the second 
experimental session was conducted. Similar to the first phase, blood samples were collected both before 
and immediately after an SSF match, and body weight was remeasured. All collected blood samples were 
subsequently transported under controlled conditions to the laboratory for biochemical analysis ( Figure 1 ).
2.4. Intervention
The participants consumed DSP supplementation (Flavinea Co.) at a dosage of 0.25 g/kg of body weight, 
dissolved in 250 mL of water, three times per week on nonconsecutive days for one month [ 23 ]. To ensure 
adherence to the supplementation protocol, participants visited the researcher to receive their supplement 
doses for each session, and consumption was supervised directly by the principal investigator. Additionally, 
the principal investigator maintained daily contact with the participants to address any potential concerns 
regarding supplementation.
2.5. Exercise protocol
The training sessions were conducted as small-sided games (2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, and 4 vs. 4) using 1.2 × 5 m 
goals, with rotating goalkeepers. These games are recognized as an intense and dynamic training

method for untrained individuals, incorporating rapid forward, backward, and lateral runs, as well as 
high-intensity movements such as dribbling, shooting, and turning [ 24 , 25 ]. Each football session began 
with a standardized warm-up, consisting of 1.5 minutes of low-intensity intermittent running, including 
the first six 20-meter shuttles from the Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance Test Level 1 [ 26 ]. Each 40-meter run 
was followed by 5 seconds of active recovery, during which participants walked twice over a 2.5-meter 
distance. The sessions were supervised by the researcher and university staff, while the players acted as 
referees. The one-hour football session was divided into four 13.5-minute bouts, each followed by 
a 1.5-minute recovery period [ 27 ].
2.6. Body composition
Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), were assessed at both the 
beginning and the end of the study. Weight and height were measured using a validated scale and 
stadiometer, with participants wearing light clothing and no shoes, and recorded to the nearest 0.5 kg 
and 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in meters). 
According to the World Health Organization, BMI is considered a standard metric for determining nutritional 
status [ 28 ].
2.7. Blood samples
At each session, blood samples were collected from participants both before and immediately after 
completing the exercise protocol. Specifically, 5 cc of venous blood was drawn from the right arm and 
transferred into tubes with or without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The blood samples were then 
centrifuged and subsequently transported to the laboratory for analysis of the targeted liver enzymes, 
including ALT, AST, and ALP, by an autoanalyzer using kits (D e lta Darman Part Co.) [ 29 ].
2.8. Chemical composition and antioxidant properties of date seed powder
Commercially prepared DSP samples were obtained from Flavinea Co. The chemical composition of DSP was 
analyzed following the standard protocols outlined by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [ 30 ]. To 
quantify the total phenolic content, the Folin – Ciocalteu colorimetric method was employed [ 31 ], while 
flavonoid concentration was determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric assay [ 32 ]. Table 1

presents the mean composition and antioxidant characteristics of DSP (per 100 g), with all measurements 
conducted in triplicate [ 15 ] ( Table 1 ).
2.9. Statistical analysis
The Shapiro – Wilk test was employed to assess the normality of the data distribution. The mean and 
standard deviation were used to statistically describe the data. Mean comparisons were conducted using 
analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Scheffé’s post hoc procedure to identify pairwise differences. 
Additionally, Pearson’s correlation analysis was employed to assess the relationships among the various 
measured variables. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS statistical software (version 24; SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA), with a significant level set at p ≤ 0.05.

3.2. Liver enzymes changes
Liver enzyme levels, including ALT, AST, ALP, and the ALT/AST ratio, measured at different time points, are 
presented in Table 3 . AST levels increased after the first match, with further statistically significant elevations 
observed prior to the second match (p = 0.019) and immediately afterward (p = 0.002). The ALP concentra -
tion decreased following the first match but showed an increase after one month of supplementation both 
immediately prior to the second match and immediately after the second match (T4), with the increase at T4 
reaching statistical significance (p = 0.035). No statistically significant changes were observed in ALT con -
centrations or in the ALT/AST ratio across the measured time points ( Figure 2 ).

4. Discussion
The present study investigated the liver enzymes Response to one-month Date Seed (Phoenix dactylifera) 
Powder Supplementation and a SSF in Inactive College Students. Our findings demonstrated that supple -
mentation with DSP for four weeks increased ALT, AST, and ALP enzymes and attenuated the ALT/AST ratio 
in Inactive male collegian s .
Since physical activity increases oxygen consumption, it is hypothesized that this condition may enhance 
the production of free radicals and contribute to oxidative stress [ 33 ]. Furthermore, as previous studies have 
classified small-sided games (SSGs) as a form of HIIT [ 34 ], it can be inferred that participation in small-sided 
football games may induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation through mechanisms such as the 
activation of NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and phospholipase A2, as well as cytochrome c release 
from mitochondria and catecholamine oxidation [ 8 , 9 ].

Additionally, research has demonstrated that physical activity can affect the levels of hepatic enzymes 
such as ALT and AST. In addition to their metabolic roles, these enzymes serve as biomarkers of tissue injury 
and cellular necrosis [ 35 ], and are typically released into the circulation in response to exercise-induced 
muscle damage, depending on the intensity and duration of physical exertion [ 36 ]. However, under certain 
conditions – such as structured exercise protocols or SSGs, enzyme levels may exhibit variations or remain 
within stable ranges [ 37–39 ].
Overall, ALT and AST, which are released from the liver into muscles, play a crucial role in protein 
metabolism. Fluctuations in their serum concentrations may reflect the extent of muscular stress induced 
by physical activity [ 40 ]. On the other hand, several adaptive responses – such as redox signaling cascades, 
regulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, skeletal muscle glucose uptake, and mitochondrial biogen -
esis – have been shown to mitigate oxidative stress following such training protocols [ 41 ]. Nevertheless, to 
further enhance the body’s antioxidant capacity, supplementation with a flavonoid- and antioxidant-rich 
compound such as DSP may be beneficial in protecting against oxidative damage.
The observed increase in hepatic enzymes – ALT, AST, and ALP – along with the reduction in the ALT/AST 
ratio following DSP supplementation, supports the hypothesis that phenolic compounds and carbohydrate 
constituents with absorptive properties in date seed extract, as well as its modulatory effects on gene 
expression, may contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Specifically, date seed extract 
has been reported to upregulate the expression of Interferon gamma and Interleukin-2 (key macrophage 
activators), as well as antioxidant enzymes such as Glutathione peroxidase, and Superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
while downregulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory gene iNOS [ 42 ]. These molecular effects may 
underlie the observed biochemical changes. In this regard, several studies have demonstrated that the 
consumption of various plant-based compounds – such as pomegranate and nuts – may positively influence 
physiological and metabolic health. Owing to their rich content of polyphenols and other bioactive 
constituents, these natural products have been shown to improve inflammatory status and metabolic 
dysregulation associated with chronic diseases and diverse physiological conditions [ 18 , 19 ].
Furthermore, the improvement in hepatic enzyme levels following date seed supplementation may be 
attributed to its antioxidant potential. Specifically, the potent antioxidant compounds present in date seeds, 
including flavonoids and active phenolic constituents, may stabilize hepatic cell membranes, thereby 
preventing the leakage of hepatic enzymes into the bloodstream [ 43 , 44 ]. Additionally, these compounds 
may alleviate oxidative stress in the liver by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus mitigating 
oxidative stress-related hepatic injury and diabetes-associated liver dysfunction [ 45 , 46 ]. In this context, 
several RCTs have provided indirect evidence that natural antioxidants – such as melatonin, propolis, and 
French maritime pine bark extract – can exert beneficial effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
hepatic biomarkers [ 20 , 21 ].
Moreover, the bioactive compounds found in date seeds have been shown to inhibit various inflamma -
tory mediators, such as TNF-α and NF-κB, thereby exerting hepatoprotective effects through the preventing 
of inflammation [ 47 ]. Specifically, date seed extract has been reported to significantly reduce levels of 
multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α [ 48 ], subsequently leading to the suppression of NF- 
κB signaling [ 49 ]. Additionally, rutin, quercetin, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid have been identified as the 
predominant polyphenols among the phenolic compounds extracted from date seeds, with a significant 
correlation observed between these polyphenols and the anti-inflammatory effects of date seed extract [ 47 ].
Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with p-coumaric, caffeic, chloro -
genic, gallic, syringic, and vanillic acids, as well as rutin, luteolin, and quercetin – compounds naturally 
present in date seeds – can prevent pathological elevations in AST and ALT levels. These protective effects 
are mediated through the enhancement of hepatic antioxidant capacity, as indicated by increased activity of 
key antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH, and CAT [ 50–58 ].
Another study demonstrated that the ability of date seeds to reverse elevated serum liver enzyme 
levels and preserve the histopathological characteristics of the liver may be attributed to their 
capacity to lower elevated serum glucose levels. This glycemic reduction, in turn, helps mitigate 
oxidative stress and prevent the metabolic alterations associated with hyperglycemia [ 46 ]. Several 
mechanisms contribute to hyperglycemia-induced tissue damage, including increased glucose flux 
through the polyol pathway, excessive intracellular production of advanced glycation end-products 
(AGEs), upregulation of AGE receptors, activation of specific isoforms of protein kinase C , and

induction of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Numerous studies suggest that these mechan -
isms are driven by a common initial event – overproduction of mitochondrial ROS [ 59 , 60 ]. 
Furthermore, date seeds have been shown to downregulate hepatic expression of the pro- 
apoptotic protein caspase-3, which may represent another key mechanism underlying their hepato -
protective effects [ 61 ].
4.1. Strengths and limitations
This study presents several novel contributions. First, its interventional design combined with precise 
biochemical assessments enhances both the reliability and validity of the findings. Additionally, the 
homogeneity of participants with respect to dietary patterns and physical activity levels – alongside 
strict monitoring of supplement intake, compliance with dietary guidelines, and avoidance of addi -
tional physical activity – helped to minimize confounding variables and strengthen the study’s 
credibility. Moreover, the innovative aspect of investigating DSP as a natural, cost-effective supple -
ment in a sports intervention underscores its potential benefits. Utilizing this agricultural byproduct 
could optimize resource use, reduce waste management costs, and improve nutritional strategies in 
sports.
However, this study has some limitations. First, the absence of a body composition analyzer prevented 
precise assessment of changes in body composition before and after the intervention. Future studies should 
employ advanced measurement tools to assess these parameters more accurately. Second, the method of 
DSP consumption posed a challenge, suggesting the need for simpler and more acceptable intake methods. 
Furthermore, exploring different dosages and supplementation durations across diverse populations could 
help establish an optimal protocol for DSP usage.
5. Conclusion
The findings of this study indicate that four weeks of supplementation with DSP influenced hepatic enzyme 
responses following an SSF. Specifically, ALT, AST, and ALP levels increased after the intervention and 
exercise, suggesting physiological adaptations to training and the potential impact of supplementation on 
liver metabolism. Furthermore, the ALT/AST ratio fluctuated throughout the study, with significant reduc -
tions observed at certain time points. These findings highlight the interactive effects of football game and 
DSP supplementation on liver function biomarkers.
