Abstract 
Retrons are a class of retroelements that produce multicopy single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and participate in anti-phage defenses in 
bacteria. Retrons have been harnessed for the overproduction of ssDNA, genome engineering and directed evolution in bacteria, yeast 
and mammalian cells. Retron-mediated ssDNA production in plants could unlock their potential applications in plant biotechnology. 
For example, ssDNA can be used as a template for homology-directed repair (HDR) in several organisms. However, current gene editing 
technologies rely on the physical delivery of synthetic ssDNA, which limits their applications. Here, we demonstrated retron-mediated 
overproduction of ssDNA in Nicotiana benthamiana. Additionally, we tested different retron architectures for improved ssDNA production 
and identified a new retron architecture that resulted in greater ssDNA abundance. Furthermore, co-expression of the gene encoding 
the ssDNA-protecting protein VirE2 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the retron systems resulted in a 10.7-fold increase in ssDNA 
production in vivo. We also demonstrated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-retron-coupled ssDNA overproduc-
tion and targeted HDR in N. benthamiana. Overall, we present an efficient approach for in vivo ssDNA production in plants, which can be 
harnessed for biotechnological applications.

1. Introduction
Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) has been widely used for vari-
ous bioengineering and synthetic biological studies. For instance, 
ssDNA is used in DNA nanotechnology, DNA repair, drug delivery, 
molecular diagnostics and DNA-based data storage (1). In genome 
engineering, ssDNA is used as a donor repair template (DRT) to 
introduce the desired mutations in the target DNA via homology-
directed repair (HDR) (2, 3). In vitro-synthesized ssDNA is artifi-
cially delivered into cells through different physical approaches 
(4, 5). However, delivery of exogenous ssDNA in the target host 
remains challenging. Delivery strategies of exogenous ssDNA vary 
by host and are generally do not provide sufficient amounts of 
ssDNA for efficient HDR in vivo (4, 5). To accelerate the applica-
tions of ssDNA, a potential technology for the in vivo production 
of ssDNA is indispensable.
Retrons are a class of retroelements found in diverse prokary-
otic cells (6, 7). In nature, retrons function as phage defense 
systems in bacteria ( 8). A wild-type (WT) retron usually com-
prises two components in a continuous polycistronic genomic 
cassette: a bacterial reverse transcriptase (RT) and retron non-
coding RNA (ncRNA). The retron ncRNA generally includes the msr 
and msd. msr is the immediate precursor during multicopy single-
stranded DNA (msDNA) production, while msd encodes the tem-
plate sequence for reverse transcription. Upon transcription, the 
msr and msd RNAs form a unique secondary structure, which can 
be recognized by the bacterial retron RT, which initiates reverse 
transcription of the msd sequence using the conserved priming 
guanosine residue in the msr and produces msDNA molecules. 
The bacterial retron RT and the paired msr are crucial for the con-
version of the msd template into msDNA. However, the internal 
msd sequence can be replaced with a DNA template containing 
any desired mutations (7).
Considering the potential of retrons as promising tools in 
molecular biology, two important improvements, enhancing 
ssDNA production by retrons and adapting retrons to work in 
more host organisms, are essential. Lopez et  al. (9) demonstrated 
different strategies to improve ssDNA production in mammalian 
cells. Remarkably, the extension of the a1/a2 region of the retron 
ncRNA facilitated higher ssDNA production in mammalian cells 
(9). Viswanathan et al. (10) downregulated the expression of the 
endogenous exonuclease and showed efficient retron-mediated 
genome editing in Escherichia coli. Their study showed the impor-
tance of protecting in vivo ssDNA from the cellular exonuclease. 
We hypothesized that the ssDNA could be protected by natu-
ral ssDNA-protecting proteins, such as VirE2 from Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens, which is involved in the protection of larger T-DNA 
molecules during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. VirE2 
can bind the T-strand cooperatively, protecting it from degrada-
tion in plant cells (11, 12). Therefore, we hypothesized that VirE2 
could aid retron-generated ssDNA protection and accumulation in 
the plant cells.
The development of efficient genome engineering tools has 
transformed the biotechnology field (13–17). Clustered regu-
larly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-
associated protein (Cas) genome editing systems have
revolutionized plant biotechnology by allowing for precise genome 
modifications (14, 18–20), but targeted editing via HDR remains 
challenging, especially in multicellular eukaryotes, including 
plants ( 2). HDR requires a repair template at the break site to 
edit the DNA sequence (21). Multiple approaches have been used 
to augment HDR efficiency. For example, DNA damage response 
factors, such as RAD18, stimulate HDR in mammalian cells (21). 
Prime editing uses a chimeric fusion protein of an RNA-guided 
DNA nickase and reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) to extend the 
genetic information engineered in an RNA template into the target 
sequence (22). Researchers have repurposed retrons as powerful 
tools for genome engineering in several organisms (6, 7, 23). For 
example, retrons have been coupled with CRISPR-Cas9 tools to 
enrich ssDNA templates at the targeted editing site for HDR in the 
yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells and plants (9, 24–26).
Here, we set out to build, test and establish an efficient 
retron system to enable enhanced ssDNA production in Nicotiana 
benthamiana. We harnessed the Ec86 retron system for ssDNA 
production. We employed Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-RNA2 vectors 
for the expression of Ec86 ncRNA and pK2GW7 vector for Ec86 
retron reverse transcriptase (Ec86 RT). We also tested various 
retron ncRNA architectures and found that Ec86 ncRNA contain-
ing an extension of the a1/a2 region up to 27 bp and a 6-bp 
msd stem length improved ssDNA production in N. benthamiana. 
For in vivo ssDNA protection, we co-expressed VirE2, encoding 
an ssDNA binding protein from Agrobacterium, together with the 
retron reagents in N. benthamiana. Additionally, we achieved pre-
cise genome editing using the CRISPR-Cas9-coupled retron sys-
tems and showed the potential applications of retron-mediated 
ssDNA production in plants.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Plasmid design and construction
For ssDNA production, we cloned the Ec86 RT driven by the 
cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter into the 
pK2GW7 vector. To test the genome engineering possibilities, we 
cloned the Cas9-fused Ec86 RT under the CaMV35S promoter 
into the pK2GW7 vector. We built different Cas9 and Ec86 RT 
fusions (Retron-Editors) using a short flexible linker (XTEN) and a 
self-cleaving linker (T2A). To measure protein expression, we cus-
tomized the Retron-Editors expression sequence downstream of 
the 3xFLAG sequence. All the above vectors were custom synthe-
sized by GenScript Biotech.
For both the ssDNA production and Retron-Editors-mediated 
HDR studies, we placed the DRT within the msd loop of the retron 
and the Cas9 sgRNA at the 3′ end of both Ec86 ncRNA and modi-
fied Ec86 ncRNA designs termed Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA, 
respectively. We selected two regions inside the NbPDS (phy-
toene desaturase) gene (PDS-1 and PDS-4) for targeted repair and 
designed the corresponding Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA sub-
strates. The complete Retro-sgRNA and mRetro-sgRNA sequences 
were ordered as gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies. Fur-
ther, we digested the gBlocks with restriction enzymes (PDS-1
with XbaI and SacI, and PDS-4 with XbaI and XhoI) and cloned 
them under the Pea early browning virus (PEBV) promoter at 
corresponding restriction sites in the TRV-RNA2 vector (27).
For VirE2 expression, we isolated A. tumefaciens (strain 
GV3101) total genome and amplified the VirE2 gene sequence 
using full-length gene-specific primers (VirE2 KpnI forward—
5′-AAGGTACCATGGATCCGAAGGCCGAAGGC-3′ and VirE2 SpeI 
reverse—5′-TTACTAGTCTACAGACTGTTTACGGTTGGGCCGCG-
3′), appending the KpnI and SpeI restriction sites at the 5 ′ and 3′
ends. The VirE2 amplicons were then cloned under the CaMV35S 
promoter at KpnI and SpeI sites in the pMDC43 vector.

2.2 Plant material and Agrobacterium-mediated 
genetic transformation
T wo- to three-week-old WT N. benthamiana plants grown under 
long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark at 25 ∘C) were used for 
all leaf infiltration experiments. We transfected the pK2GW7
vectors containing Cas9-RT protein effectors and the TRV-RNA2
vectors containing the retron-sgRNA substrates into Agrobac-
terium GV3101 cells, independently. Agrobacterium cells harbor-
ing Cas9-RT protein effectors and retron-sgRNA substrates were 
co-infiltrated into N. benthamiana. For the ssDNA protection exper-
iments, the Agrobacterium cells harboring the pMDC43 vector car-
rying a VirE2 gene expression unit were co-infiltrated together with 
the pK2GW7 and TRV-RNA2 vectors (27).
2.3 Western blot analysis
To check the Cas9-RT fusion protein accumulation, we conducted 
Western blot analyses. The infiltrated leaves were frozen and 
ground thoroughly in liquid nitrogen, and whole protein was 
extracted following a previously described method ( 28). Then, 
30 μl of the protein was separated by an 8% polyacrylamide gel. 
The protein was transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) membrane as described by Mahas  et al. (29). 
The membranes were incubated with primary antibody against 
α-FLAG antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) and then anti-mouse anti-
body (1:1000, Invitrogen) to detect FLAG fusion proteins. Finally, 
the membrane was treated with an ECL detection reagent (Thermo 
Scientific) and observed under a chemiluminescent scanner.
2.4 Southern blot analysis
In vivo ssDNA production was detected by Southern blot analysis. 
ssDNA can be extracted together with the total RNA ( 30). There-
fore, we isolated total RNA from all the infiltrated leaves using 
Invitrogen™ TRIzol™ reagent as described in the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Total extracted RNA (20μg) from each target was used for 
the Southern blot experiment. We conducted independent South-
ern blot experiments for each target using 60 pg of the 140-bp 
amplified msd-DRT-msd fragment as a size range positive con-
trol. We used total RNA isolated from plants lacking the Ec86 RT 
(only transfected with RNA2-Retro-sgRNA or pK2-Cas9/RNA2-Retro-
sgRNA and the WT) as negative controls. To distinguish the ssDNA 
from the total RNA, the same RNA samples without any nucle-
ase treatment, with RNase treatment and with DNase treatment 
were run side by side in the same agarose gel for each target. 
In the case of plants containing modified retron architectures, 
such as RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-
mRetro-sgRNA-3, we treated all the samples with RNase and ran 
them on an agarose gel. We then conducted the Southern blot 
experiment as described by Ali et al. (30).
For the corresponding PDS-1 and PDS-4 targets, we used 100-
bp (only the DRT) DIG-labeled denatured DNA sequences as 
probes for the RNA2-Retro-sgRNA and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA com-
binations in Southern blotting experiments. After the DIG-probe 
hybridization, the membrane was washed and treated with anti-
digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (Roche). The anti-digoxigenin-AP 
Fab fragments were then washed out, and the membrane was 
treated with CDP-star chemiluminescent substrate (Sigma life 
sciences). Finally, the membrane was imaged under the ChemiDoc 
imaging system (Bio-Rad) and evaluated by Image J software.
2.5 Amplicon deep sequencing
Amplicon deep sequencing was used to test the Retron-Editors-
mediated precise genome engineering in N. benthamiana. We iso-
lated the total genomic DNA from three independent infiltration 
experiments for each target (three different biological replicates) 
and performed deep amplicon sequencing. Subsequently, the 
∼300-bp Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) fragment was amplified 
using high-fidelity Phusion polymerase with gene-specific primers 
mentioned in Primers_GeneFrags.fa file. The PCR amplicons were 
further purified and used for MiSeq library preparation. The library 
was prepared using TruSeq Nano DNA Library Prep kit following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were run on the 
MiSeq platform, and the data were analyzed using online Cas-
analyzer software (31). The HDR frequencies were determined as 
the ratio of HDR reads among the total reads with both indicators.
2.6 Statistical analysis
The raw data were analyzed and visualized by GraphPad Prism 9. 
All numerical data were presented as mean± standard deviation. 
We included three independent biological replicates in amplicon 
deep sequencing experiments. For each replicate, both HDR and 
indel frequencies of the WT group and six experimental groups 
were measured. T wo-tailed Student’s t-tests were selected for sta-
tistical analysis to measure the differences among the indicated 
groups.
3. Results
3.1 Design and construction of retron systems 
for in planta expression
To harness the retrons for ssDNA production in plants, we 
designed and cloned EC86-RT downstream of the CaMV35S pro-
moter in the pK2GW7 vector to construct the pK2GW7-RT vector 
and tested it in transient expression assays (Figure 1a). We adopted 
different strategies to exploit the retron functions for genome 
engineering applications (Figure 1b). We fused Cas9 and EC86-RT 
together using two different linkers, XTEN and T2A, to express the 
EC86-RT and Cas9 as a single or separate protein, respectively. 
Cas9 was located at the N-terminus, while EC86-RT was located 
on the C-terminus of the linkers. In another modality, we designed 
the EC86-RT on the N-terminus and Cas9 on the C-terminus using 
XTEN as the linker (Figure 1b). We cloned these cassettes under 
the control of the CaMV35S promoter on the pK2GW7 backbone. 
The pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9 constructs were used as controls for our 
experiments (Figure 1b).
We replaced the WT Ec86 ncRNA msd loop sequence with our 
100-bp DRTs comprising the ∼47-bp homology arms and desired 
mutations for PDS-1 or PDS-4 targets (Figure 1b and c). The DRT 
sequences comprise different targeted mutations, including a 
5-nt insertion ( PDS-1) and a 6-nt deletion (PDS-4) (Figure 1c). To 
avoid re-targeting, we destroyed the protospacer adjacent motif 
sequences in the DRTs via a 1-nt substitution (Figure 1c). Employ-
ing the above-mentioned DRTs and sgRNA sequences of the 
PDS-1 and PDS-4 targets, we designed a basic Retro-sgRNA archi-
tecture that contained the 6-bp msd stem and a 12-bp a1/a2 
arm (Figure 1b). We used the TRV-RNA2 vector system to express 
the Retro-sgRNAs under the PEBV promoter (Figure 1b). The anno-
tated sequence plasmids are included in PlasmidSeqs.zip file.
3.2 Retron-mediated ssDNA production in
N. benthamiana
To test whether retrons produce ssDNA in plants, we co-infiltrated 
the pK2-RT and RNA2-Retro vectors via Agrobacterium into young 
N. benthamiana leaves. We hypothesized that the RNA2-Retro vec-
tors generate Retro-sgRNA transcripts in vivo, and then EC86-RT 
reverse transcribes the Retro-sgRNA transcripts to produce ssDNA

without any nuclease treatment, with RNase treatment, and with DNase treatment on an agarose gel side by side, together with the 140-bp amplified 
PDS-1 or PDS-4 msd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe for the corresponding target. The membrane was 
imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).
in vivo. Leaves were sampled 3 days post-infiltration and used for 
molecular analysis.
We confirmed the protein expression from different
Cas9-linker-Ec86 RT fusions in N. benthamiana. We observed 
a 200 kDa band corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9-XTEN-Ec86 RT 
and 3XFLAG-RT-XTEN-Cas9 from the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and 
pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 constructs, respectively. We also observed 
an extra 170 kDa band corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9 in 
pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT construct (Supplementary Figure S1). We 
assumed that the orientation of Cas9-XTEN-Ec86 RT fusion is 
unstable. The pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT construct produced a 170 kDa 
band corresponding to 3XFLAG-Cas9, indicating that the self-
cleaving T2A linker was completely cleaved. Overall, our results 
confirmed that Cas9-linker-Ec86 RT was successfully expressed in
N. benthamiana.
To detect and corroborate the production of ssDNA, we per-
formed Southern blotting analysis and probed for the PDS-1 and 
PDS-4 targets. We extracted the total RNA and used it directly with-
out any treatment. The same RNA was also treated with RNase to 
digest all the RNA and/or with DNase to digest all DNA. The RNA 
without treatment, RNase-treated and DNase-treated samples 
were run on the same blot to distinguish between RNA and DNA. 
The RNA without treatment showed strong signals, indicating the 
presence of various transcripts along with ssDNA (Figure 2). The 
DNase-treated samples also showed strong signals, representing 
the presence of retron transcripts  (Figure 2). The RNase-treated

amplified PDS-1 or PDS-4 msd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe for the corresponding target. The 
membrane was imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).
samples showed a single band at 140 bp in all the targets with 
pK2-RT, pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-
RT backbones together with the corresponding RNA2-Retro-sgRNA
construct, suggesting the production of ssDNA (Figure 2). However, 
the RNA2-Retro-sgRNA alone, RNA2-Retro-sgRNA with pK2-Cas9 and 
WT plants did not produce any ssDNA (Figure 2). The pK2-RT and 
pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones showed much higher ssDNA produc-
tion compared with the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9
backbones (Figure 2). Overall, these results indicate that EC86-
RT and Retro-sgRNA were expressed in the plant cells to produce 
ssDNA. However, pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT, where Cas9 and RT are pro-
duced as two separate proteins, showed higher ssDNA compared 
to the other designs.
3.3 Modifications in the retron architecture 
increased ssDNA production
To improve ssDNA production, we modified the retron architec-
ture with different msd and a1/a2 arm lengths (Primers_Gene-
Frags.fa file). We designed mRetro-sgRNA-1 with a 6 bp msd stem 
and extended the a1/a2 arm up to 27 bp; in mRetro-sgRNA-2, we 
extended the length of the msd stem up to 18 bp and kept the 
a1/a2 arm length up to 12 bp. Similarly, in mRetro-sgRNA-3, the 
msd stem was extended up to 18 bp and the a1/a2 arm up to 27 
bp (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S2a).
We tested the ssDNA production of the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-
1, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures 
together with the pK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT back-
bones by Southern blot analysis. In order to compare the 
improvement of the modified retron designs, we also included 
the unmodified RNA2-Retro-sgRNA version together with the 
pK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones in the same 
Southern blotting experiment. Compared to the unmodified 
RNA2-Retro-sgRNA version, the new RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 ver-
sion together with the pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT backbones 
showed improved ssDNA production for both PDS-1 and PDS-4 
targets (Figure 3b). However, the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-
mRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures together with the pK2-RT and pK2-
Cas9-T2A-RT backbones showed very little or no ssDNA production 
of the PDS-1 or PDS-4 targets (Figure 3b). As expected, all retron 
architectures with the pK2-Cas9 backbone did not show ssDNA 
production (Figure 3b). The extension of the a1/a2 region in 
the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 version significantly improved ssDNA 
production, while the msd stem extension in both RNA2-
mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 architectures did not 
aid ssDNA production. The RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 version with 
a 6 bp msd stem and a 27 bp a1/a2 arm showed higher 
ssDNA production compared to the other designs. This further 
showed that modifications in the retron architecture affect ssDNA
production.

Figure 4. Southern blot analysis for the detection of ssDNA in N. benthamiana co-expressing VirE2 and retron systems. Total RNA was isolated from N. 
benthamiana to detect the PDS-4 target, where RNase treated and the samples were run on an agarose gel together with the 140-bp amplified PDS-4
msd-DRT-msd as a positive control. We used a 100-bp DIG-labeled DRT as a probe. The membrane was imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system 
(Bio-Rad).
3.4 VirE2 facilitated successful ssDNA production
We reasoned that in addition to retron architecture, there must 
be other factors that impact ssDNA production. One of these 
factors is the stability of the ssDNA after synthesis via reverse 
transcription. VirE2 is involved in the protection of ssDNA dur-
ing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation ( 11). Therefore, we 
cloned VirE2 gene from Agrobacterium under the CaMV35S pro-
moter in the pMDC43 vector and built the pMDC43-VirE2 vector 
(Supplementary Figure S2b). We performed Southern blotting with 
the N. benthamiana leaves co-infiltrated with the pMDC43-VirE2
vector together with the Cas9-RT effectors (pK2-Cas9, pK2-RT and 
pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT) and the retron substrates (PDS-1: RNA2-mRetro-
sgRNA-1 and PDS-4: RNA2-Retro-sgRNA, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1
and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3). We included RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1
together with pK2-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT without pMDC43-
VirE2 as the experimental controls. Total RNA, including ssDNA 
from all the samples, was RNase-treated, and then Southern blot-
ting was performed. As previously observed, RNA2-Retro-sgRNA
and all the RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA sequences with the pK2-Cas9 back-
bone did not produce ssDNA. Interestingly, the co-expression 
of pMDC43-VirE2 with retron substrates (PDS-1: RNA2-mRetro-
sgRNA-1 and PDS-4: RNA2-Retro-sgRNA, RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 and 
RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3) and pK2-RT and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT showed a 
significant amount of ssDNA production compared to the samples 
without pMDC43-VirE2 (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3 ). 
We analyzed the difference in ssDNA production between RNA2-
mRetro-sgRNA-1 co-expressed with VirE2 and without VirE2 by 
ImageJ software and found a 10.7-fold and 9-fold enhance-
ment of ssDNA for PDS-1 and PDS-4 with VirE2 co-expression 
(Supplementary Figure S4a and b). These results demonstrated 
that VirE2 protected the ssDNA from degradation and therefore 
significantly enhanced the amount of ssDNA.
3.5 Retron-Editors-mediated precise HDR in
N. benthamiana
Because retron-mediated ssDNA has been used for HDR in the 
yeast and mammalian cells ( 9, 25), and because we success-
fully produced ssDNA with our retron designs, we hypothe-
sized that retron-meditated ssDNA overproduction might facil-
itate HDR in N. benthamiana cells ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). 
To test this, we extracted total genomic DNA from the infil-
trated leaf samples (three independent biological replicates for 
each target), amplified the target DNA by PCR and used the 
PCR amplicons for deep sequencing. We initially tested the 
ability of all the Cas9-RT effectors, including pK2-Cas9, pK2-
RT, pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT, 
for HDR. The pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT construct with different RNA2-
Retro-sgRNAs showed greater HDR frequencies: 0.1% ± 0.04% for 
PDS-1 and 0.03% ± 0.01% for PDS-4 targets (Figure 5a). How-
ever, the pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT, pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9 and pK2-RT con-
structs with different RNA2-Retro-sgRNAs did not show sub-
stantial HDR (Figure 5a). No HDR events were detected when 
only RNA2-Retro-sgRNA or RNA2-Retro-sgRNA was transfected 
with pK2-Cas9 (Figure 5a). The results showed that the Cas9-
RT effectors mediated HDR editing in a RT and Cas9-dependent
manner.
Simultaneously, we examined double-strand break repair via 
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which produces insertions 
and deletions (indels). Among the three fusion backbones, we 
observed greater indel frequencies with pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT in all 
the targets, viz., 28.7% ± 2.4% ( PDS-1) and 12.2–18.6% ± 7.5% 
(PDS-4) (Figure 5b). pK2-Cas9-XTEN-RT and pK2-RT-XTEN-Cas9
showed minimal indel frequencies (Figure 5b). As expected, pK2-
Cas9 showed greater indel frequencies, whereas no indels were 
observed in only RNA2-Retro-sgRNA and pK2-RT with RNA2-Retro-
sgRNA (Figure 5b).
To check whether higher ssDNA abundance can improve 
the HDR efficiency of Retron-Editors, we also conducted deep 
amplicon sequencing for the plants carrying the improved RNA2-
mRetro-sgRNA-1 architecture with pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT and with and 
without co-expression of the pMDC43-VirE2 vector. Unfortunately, 
we did not observe improvement in HDR efficiency with these 
modifications (Supplementary Table S1) and co-expression of the 
pMDC43-VirE2 vector (Supplementary Table S2). Overall, these 
results showed poor HDR frequencies in plant cells, and further

4. Discussion
In vivo ssDNA production would allow for expanded applications 
in various fields of study, including synthetic biology and nan-
otechnology, and for various bioengineering applications (1). Fur-
thermore, the localized production of exogenous ssDNA to serve 
as a template for HDR is an important goal for genome editing 
studies. In genome engineering, the synthetic ssDNA is delivered 
into the targeted tissues by several physical methods (4, 5). Despite 
efforts, devising an efficient modality for in vivo ssDNA produc-
tion remains a challenge. Retron systems produce ssDNA in vivo
continuously in several organisms ( 7). Moreover, retrons enable 
ssDNA production in germline cells where the HDR machinery is 
predominant, leading to precise genome editing (25). Besides, the 
capability of retron-mediated ssDNA production has been further 
applied for continuous self-evolution (35), biological data storage 
(36, 37) and high-throughput functional variant screening (38). 
The exploration of retron functions in planta would adapt these 
retron toolkits for plant biological applications. Considering retron 
Ec86 system has been well studied for ssDNA production and HDR 
in bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells ( 9, 25), we selected the 
retron Ec86 system to produce ssDNA in N. benthamiana. ssDNA 
production is dependent on the retron ncRNA structure and the 
retron RT ( 9, 32). Instead of using WT Ec86 ncRNA, we replaced 
the WT msd template with our DRT sequences (100 bp) at the msd 
loop region as suggested by Sharon et al. (25). Our results showed 
successful ssDNA production in N. benthamiana. Moreover, the pro-
duction of ssDNA was more efficient with the pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT 
8 Synthetic Biology, 2022, Vol. 7, No. 1
and pK2-RT constructs, which contain free RT protein. Since 
the abundance of ssDNA is directly related to the availability 
of retron RT, we assumed that the greater production of ssDNA 
with pK2-Cas9-T2A-RT was due to the availability of the inde-
pendent Ec86 RT protein. The lower abundance of ssDNA in the 
XTEN-fused Retron-Editors, which produce Cas9-XTEN-RT fusion 
proteins, may result from steric hindrances and the functional 
inhibition of the RT protein. Our results also confirmed that ssDNA 
production is retron RT dependent, since no ssDNA was detected 
when RNA2-Retro-sgRNA with pK2-Cas9 or only RNA2-Retro-sgRNA
was transfected into N. benthamiana leaves.
Lopez et al. (9) showed that extension of the length of the a1/a2 
arm could aid in ssDNA production in E. coli, yeast and mammalian 
cells. In line with this, our modified retron architectures, such as 
RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-1 harboring a 6-bp msd stem and an a1/a2 
arm (msr) extension up to 27 bp, showed that the a1/a2 exten-
sion improved ssDNA production. Since the a1/a2 region acts as 
a primer for reverse transcription, a longer a1/a2 region may bet-
ter facilitate reverse transcription to improve ssDNA production 
(9). However, our results showed that extension of the msd stem 
length in RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-2 and RNA2-mRetro-sgRNA-3 caused 
adverse effects on ssDNA production. One potential explanation 
is that the secondary structure of retron ncRNA (reverse tran-
scription region) becomes more complicated with the extension 
of msd stem region which would affect the reverse transcrip-
tion for retron ssDNA (Supplementary Figure S6). We also specu-
lated that the in vivo-produced ssDNA would be severely degraded 
by cellular exonucleases in plant cells and that ssDNA protec-
tion from cellular exonucleases might increase the abundance of 
ssDNA in vivo. VirE2 functions in T-DNA protection during Agrobac-
terium-mediated transformation (11). Therefore, we co-expressed 
VirE2 with the retron systems and found a 10.7-fold improvement 
of ssDNA production. Overall, we established a high-efficiency 
ssDNA production method via co-expression of VirE2 with the 
retron systems in N. benthamiana.
Additionally, we tested retron-based genome editing platforms 
(Retron-Editors) in N. benthamiana . Deep amplicon sequencing 
showed successful HDR repair by Retron-Editors, indicating that 
ssDNA can be harnessed as the repair template for HDR in plants. 
This also demonstrated the accuracy of ssDNA produced in plants. 
For Retron-Editors, the fusion of Ec86 RT with Cas9 on either 
N-terminal or C-terminal might affect the Cas9 activity. There-
fore, the self-cleavage linker (T2A linker) should be selected for 
the linker between Ec86 RT and Cas9 for higher genome editing 
efficiency. After confirming the positive effects of VirE2 and the 
extension of the a1/a2 region on ssDNA production, we also tested 
these designs for genome editing. However, the new designs did 
not improve the HDR frequency, indicating that the abundance 
of ssDNA is not the limiting factor. Conversely, Lopez  et al. (9) 
obtained around 60% of HDR edit in yeast cells via Cas9/retron-
mediated precise genome editing in 48 h. The differentiation in 
the abundance of retron-produced ssDNA in yeast cells and planta
could cause the difference. Compared with two-nucleotide mod-
ification, five-nucleotide modifications in this study are more 
difficult which might also result in lower HDR frequencies. Fur-
ther efforts are needed to improve the HDR editing efficiency 
of Retron-Editors in plants. For example, VirE2 binding proteins 
(VIP1 and VIP2) have been reported to target the T-strand to 
regions of chromatin, promoting integration. The co-expression 
of VIP proteins and VirE2 may improve the targeting of ssDNA to 
chromatin so as to improve HDR efficiency (33). Suppressing the 
NHEJ pathways has also been reported to stimulate HDR repair sig-
nificantly. Qi et al. (34) achieved a 5-fold to 16-fold enhancement 
in HDR editing in a ku70-mutant Arabidopsis. In the future, 
the downregulation of NHEJ key factors would also be tested to 
improve Cas9/Retron system. Additionally, we tested two loci in 
the PDS gene which showed clear variations in genome editing effi-
ciencies in this study. Therefore, higher HDR efficiencies might be 
achieved if other target genes were tested in the future. In sum-
mary, this study proposed a new strategy for in vivo ssDNA produc-
tion in plants, which will have great potential for various biological
applications.
