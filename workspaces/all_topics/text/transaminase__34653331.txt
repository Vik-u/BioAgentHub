ABSTRACT: ω-Transaminases (ω-TAs) catalyze the conversion
of ketones to chiral amines, often with high enantioselectivity and
speciﬁcity, which makes them attractive for industrial production
of chiral amines. Tailoringω-TAs to accept non-natural substrates
is necessary because of their limited substrate range. We present a
computational protocol for predicting the enantioselectivity and
catalytic selectivity of anω-TA from Vibrio ﬂuvialis with diﬀerent
substrates and benchmark it against 62 compounds gathered from
the literature. Rosetta-generated complexes containing an external
aldimine intermediate of the transamination reaction are used as
starting conformations for multiple short independent molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. The combination of molecular
docking and MD simulations ensures su ﬃcient and accurate sampling of the relevant conformational space. Based on the
frequency of near-attack conformations observed during the MD trajectories, enantioselectivities can be quantitatively predicted. The
predicted enantioselectivities are in agreement with a benchmark dataset of experimentally determinedee% values. The substrate-
range predictions can be based on the docking score of the external aldimine intermediate. The low computational cost required to
run the presented framework makes it feasible for use in enzyme design to screen thousands of enzyme variants.
■ INTRODUCTION
ω-Transaminases (ω-TAs) are pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-(PLP)-
dependent enzymes that catalyze the reversible transfer of an
amino group from an amino donor to a keto acceptor, yielding
a keto product and a chiral amine in the process.
1 The high
enantioselectivity of most ω-TAs makes them attractive
catalysts in the industrial production of chiral amines. 2,3
Classical chemical synthesis methods usually involve the use of
expensive catalysts and hazardous conditions. Usingω-TAs for
the production of chiral amines can be advantageous because
ω-TAs oﬀer high enantioselectivity, do not require external
cofactors, allow high reactant concentrations, and give good
product yields under mild reaction conditions.
4 However, the
selectivity of ω-TAs needs to be tailored to the substrate of
interest for industrial application.
The range of substrates that can be accepted byω-TAs of
the class III transaminases (fold-type I PLP enzymes) is mainly
limited by the size of the small binding pocket, which rarely
accommodates side chains larger than a methyl group. These
ω-TAs also have a large binding pocket that can easily accept
more bulky substituents such as an aryl or alkyl group.
5 The
size duality of the small and large binding pockets is what
confers ω-TAs their high enantioselectivity. Both binding
pockets are hydrophobic, and both can be targeted to expand
the substrate range of the enzymes.
6,7 Tailoring the reactivity
of ω-TAs to accept non-natural substrates is usually achieved
via repetitive rounds of mutagenesis and testing. In general,
rational design and in silico approaches can be very eﬀective
for enzyme selectivity engineering but require case-speci ﬁc
ﬁne-tuning to produce reliable results.8 Therefore, we aimed to
develop a computational framework that can be used in
enzyme design for assessing the substrate scope and
enantioselectivity of ω-TA variants. The accuracy of the
presented framework for the prediction of enantioselectivity
and substrate scope was evaluated on a benchmark dataset of
62 compounds gathered from the literature.
The (S)-selective ω-TA from Vibrio ﬂuvialis (Vf-TA) was
chosen as the model system for the benchmarking of the
presented framework because it is a well-characterized enzyme.
Vf-TA was ﬁrst described in 1999 by Shin and Kim,
9 and a
high-resolution crystal structure was reported in 2013.10 Vf-TA
has enzymatic activity toward both aliphatic and aromatic
substrates,
5 generally producing highly enantiopure amines
from ketones.Vf-TA tolerates mutations in both the small and
large binding pockets. TailoringVf-TA to accept non-natural
substrates via computational methods has previously been

attempted with varying degrees of success.11,12 A common
feature of these studies is their qualitative nature and the small
range (less than 5) of screened substrates.11,13
Previous computational approaches aimed at understanding
or engineering the reactivity ofω-TAs have examined the keto
substrate,11−14 amino substrate,15 quinonoid intermediate,12,16
ketimine intermediate,17 or external aldimine intermediate17 as
the ligand. The external aldimine intermediate was chosen for
the current study because it is theﬁrst chiral intermediate in
the second half reaction and is involved in the rate-limiting
transamination step. Protonation of the quinonoid intermedi-
ate by the catalytic lysine leads to the formation of the external
aldimine, which is subsequently cleaved to form the resting
enzyme and the amine product. Cassimjee et al.
1 estimated the
energy proﬁles of a half-transamination reaction catalyzed by
an ω-TA from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-TA) going
from (S)-1-phenylethylamine to acetophenone using density
functional theory calculations of all the involved intermediates
and transition states. The energy pro ﬁle showed that the
external aldimine intermediate is fenced by two large energy
barriers corresponding to transition states in the forward or
backward reaction direction, to form the quinonoid or the
geminal diamine intermediates, respectively. Hence, we
hypothesized that the enantiomer better accommodated by
the enzyme in the external aldimine form would display a
higher overall turnover rate.
To test the hypothesis that modeling the external aldimine
intermediate is enough to predict the enantioselectivity (and
substrate scope) of Vf-TA, we compared the results of the
presented molecular modeling protocol against experimentally
measured values for the asymmetric synthesis reactions
(ketone → amine). The approach makes three assumptions:

existing literature, and sources are cited inTable 1. The enantiomeric excess for the asymmetric synthesis reactions used to obtain amines01−49
from their respective ketones has been reported. Compounds50−62 were only used for substrate-scope predictions because they are nonchiral or
the experimentalee% for asymmetric synthesis was not found in the literature. All structures represent the preferred enantiomer ofVf-TA and are
drawn with the bulkiest substituent to the left, i.e., in the position corresponding to the phenyl group of the (S)-enantiomer of01. Following CIP
rules, all compounds are (S)-amines, except 32, 33, 35, 36, 45, and 62 which formally are (R)-enantiomers.

(1) the energy proﬁle for the half-transamination reaction is
the same inVf-TA as inCv-TA; (2) the formation of all other
reaction intermediates is not rate-limiting for the tested
compounds; and (3) the forward and backward half-trans-
amination reactions behave similarly. Theﬁrst assumption is
based on the fact that bothVf-TA andCv-TA are (S)-selective
ω-TAs belonging to the PLP fold-type I superfamily class III in
which active site groups and the catalytic mechanism are
conserved.
18 The second assumption requires that the relative
energy proﬁle for the half-transamination reaction described
for (S)-1-phenylethylamine to acetophenone1 be maintained
regardless of the substituents attached to the reacting Cα. The
third assumption is based on the fact that the transamination
reaction is reversible at every step of the catalytic cycle, and
therefore, the principle of microscopic reversibility or detailed
balance applies.
19 An additional advantage of modeling the
external aldimine intermediate is the reduced computational
cost. Because the C
α is covalently bound via a Schiﬀ base to the
PLP cofactor, the search space in the docking stage is
substantially reduced, thereby eliminating the need for initial
placement algorithms.
20
The results demonstrate the potential of using a
combination of docking and molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations for computational screening of di ﬀerent trans-
aminase substrates. The developed protocol can give
quantitative predictions ofω-TA selectivity and enantioselec-
tivity at a low computational cost, which can be employed in
enzyme engineering eﬀorts aimed at tailoring catalytic activity.
■ METHODS
Collection of the Benchmark Dataset. A list of 62
compounds was gathered from existing literature to test the
accuracy of the presented computational protocol (Figure 1).
The gathered dataset contains experimentally determined
values for enantiomeric excess (ee%) of amines (compounds
01−49) obtained in asymmetric synthesis catalyzed byVf-TA.
The ee% values obtained from kinetic resolution of racemic
amines were not included in the dataset because of the
dependance of observed ee% values on reaction progress.
Additionally, data of compounds50−62 were gathered for the
substrate scope prediction task. The range of molecules
explored is large, with the majority of the diversity coming
from the substituent that binds to the large binding pocket. By
contrast, the substituent that binds to the small binding pocket
is a methyl or a short-chain alkyl group, with a few exceptions
(e.g., compounds 28, 32, 33, 35, and 36).
Preparation of Ligand Structures. Initial atom coor-
dinates for the (S)- and (R)-amine dataset (Figure 1) were
created using Avogadro software
21 and optimized with 500
steps of steepest descent minimization in the MMFF94 force-
ﬁeld.
22 The subsequent steps were made in YASARA (www.
yasara.org).23 Each amino compound was covalently bonded
to the pyridoxal cofactor via a Schi ﬀ base to form the
corresponding external aldimine complex, hereafter referred to
simply as the ligand. The geometry of the ligand was then
optimized in AM1 with implicit solvent.24 Atomic charges were
assigned for the ligand using the restrained electrostatic
potential approach included in the Gaussian09 software
package.25 A library of relevant low-energy rotamers was
generated for each compound by random perturbation of all
torsion angles that contained at least one heavy atom
(SampleDih YASARA routine), with the exception of ligand
atoms originally belonging to the PMP cofactor. The latter
were kept frozen during the rotamer generation stage. A total
of 32 independent libraries were created for each ligand, with
each library containing rotamers where theχ
1 dihedral was set
to aﬁxed value (χ1 ={ −180°, −168.75°, −157.50°, ..., +180°})
(Figure 2). The χ1 dihedral indicates the orientation of the
Cα−Hα bond with respect to the PLP ring, and the precise
deﬁnition is shown inFigure 3A. The initial size of each of the
32 libraries was 1000 rotamers, but after pruning for
uniqueness (pair-wise RMSD between any two rotamers
>0.005 Å) the size of each library ended in between 100 and
800 unique rotamers. In other words, the entire dataset

{−180°, −168.75°, −157.50°, ..., +180°}, adding up to 32 independent rotamer libraries per examined ligand.

contained 49 unique chemical compounds, each compound
had two external aldimine forms (one for the (S)- and one for
the (R)-enantiomer), each of them had 32 unique rotamer
libraries, and each of those libraries contained 100−800 unique
rotamers.
Preparation of the Enzyme Scaﬀold Structure. The
crystal structure of an (S)-selective ω-TA from Vibrio ﬂuvialis
(PDB: 4E3Q) was used as scaﬀold.10 Molecular modeling was
performed using the dimer derived from subunits A and B. The
dimer contains two PMP cofactors located in the subunit
interface approximately 15 Å apart, forming two binding sites.
Se-Met residues were converted into Met by the YASARA
CleanObj routine. The protonation states of Asp, Glu, His, and
Lys were predicted by a YASARA automated routine
(OptHyd).
26 All Asp, Glu, and Lys were in their standard
protonation states at neutral pH, and histidine residues were in
the HIP (charge +1, bothδ- andε-nitrogens protonated; His at
26 and 178), HID (neutral,δ-nitrogen protonated; His at 35,
151, and 362), and HIE (neutral,ε-nitrogen protonated, His at
65, 83, 132, 183, 319, and 326) forms. All water molecules
were removed from the crystal structure for the docking stage
but were later added back in for the MD simulations.
Rosetta Docking of the External Aldimines.Docking of
the external aldimine intermediates (ligand) into the active site
of Vf-TA was performed with the Rosetta Enzyme Design
application (build number 57927).
27 The following steps were
performed on the binding site that is mainly composed of
subunit A residues. Ligands were initially placed in the binding
site by superimposing the pyridine ring heavy atoms to the
equivalent PMP atoms found in the crystal structure. The
following command-line arguments were used when running
Rosetta: −enzdes, −cst_predock, −cst_design, −cut1 0.0,
−cut2 0.0, −cut3 8.0, −cut4 10.0, −cst_min, −chi_min,
−bb_min, −packing::use_input_sc, −packing::soft_rep_de-
sign, −design_min_cycles 3, −ex1:level 4, −ex2:level 4,
−ex1aro:level 4, −ex2aro:level 4.
27 For the enantioselectivity
predictions, 10 docking structures were produced for eachχ1
dihedral, and from the resulting 320 structures (32× 10), the
top-scoring solutions, that is, the low energy conformations,
were selected to serve as starting conformations for MD
simulations. The selection was carried out on the basis of the
Rosetta interface energy, adding up to a total of 64 (top20%)
or 32 (top10%) starting structures for MD simulations. For
substrate-range predictions, 200 Rosetta structures were
generated for each enzyme−ligand complex (all with χ
1 =
−90°).
MD Simulations of the Docked Structures.Short MD
simulations were performed using the top-ranking docked
complexes to estimate the enantiomeric excess. All simulations
were carried out in YASARA, using the knowledge-based
YAMBER3 force ﬁeld
28 for protein residues and the GAFF
force ﬁeld29 for ligands. As for the identity of the ligands, the
binding site of subunit A contained the docked external
aldimine form of the query compound, while the binding site
of subunit B contained the crystallographic PMP cofactor. The
protein−ligand complexes were placed in a cubic simulation
cell extending at least 10 Å beyond the protein. Crystallo-
graphic water molecules, formerly removed in the docking
stage, were added back to the enzyme. Any water molecule
with its center of mass closer than 1.1 Å from any non-water
Scheme 1. Transamination Reaction Mechanisma
aThe fully reversible reaction consists of two half-transamination reactions.1 In the ﬁrst half reaction (green arrows), L-alanine is converted into
pyruvate, resulting in the generation of the E/PMP intermediate (PMP is pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate). The second half (red arrows) consists of
substrate entry and formation of the Michaelis complex with E:PMP. A nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate (acetophenone
shown as an example) by the amino group of PMP leads to the formation of the ketimine intermediate. A further rearrangement involves the
catalytic lysine (Lys285), actingﬁrst as a base and later as an acid, to form the quinonoid and external aldimine intermediates, respectively. Finally,
Lys285 performs a nucleophilic attack on the iminium carbon of the external aldimine, resulting in the formation of amine (1-phenylethylamine)
and an internal aldimine (E-PLP).

heavy atom was deleted from the simulation box. Enough
TIP3P water molecules were added toﬁll the simulation cell,
along with Na+ and Cl− ions to aﬁnal concentration of 0.150
M. The pKa values for residues Asp, Glu, His, and Lys were
predicted using the YASARA neutralization experiment
routine30 at pH 8, resulting in standard protonation states
for Asp, Glu, and Lys, and the following protonation states for
histidine: HID (35, 151, and 362) and HIE (26, 65, 83, 132,
178, 183, 319, and 326). The protonation states of histidine
residues 26 and 178 di ﬀered from the protonation states
obtained using theOptHyd YASARA routine. The cell charge
was neutralized with Na
+ ions. Next, 25 steps of steepest
descent minimization were carried out to remove conforma-
tional stress followed by simulated annealing toﬁnd an energy-
minimum conformation. Simulated annealing was performed
by slowly cooling down the system for 100 steps from 298 to 0
K by rescaling atom velocities by a factor of 0.9 each step, after
which 100 steps of classical MD are performed at 298 K. After
obtaining an energy-minimized conformation, the system was
gradually warmed up from 0 to 298 K in 3.0 ps. A short
equilibration of 2.0 ps (timestep = 2.0 fs) preceded the
production run of 20.0 or 100.0 ps. The simulations were
performed using the leap-frog integration step method of
YASARA,
31 with a timestep of 2.5 fs. To gain performance, the
nonbonded interactions were evaluated every second step. To
enable such a large timest ep for the intermolecular
interactions, high-frequency bonds and angles (involving
hydrogens) were replaced by constraints. LINCS was used to
constrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms with a
relative geometric tolerance of 10
−4.32 Pressure (1.0 bar) and
temperature (298 K) were maintained with a modi ﬁed
Berendsen barostat and thermostat, respectively. 28,33 Long-
range electrostatic interactions were treated with the particle
mesh Ewald algorithm and short-range interactions with direct-
space Coulombic interactions with a cutoﬀ of 8.0 Å.
34 The
production run was 20 ps in length withﬁve seeds (5× 20 ps
setup) or 100 ps with one seed (1× 100 ps setup), bringing
the total simulation time to 6400 ps per examined ligand in
either setup.
Calculation of ee% from MD Trajectories. The MD
trajectories of each ligand were scored by counting the number
of frames in which a near-attack-conformation (NAC) was
observed (Figure 3). NACs were measured on-the-ﬂy every 20
fs, adding up to 1000 datapoints for a 20 ps trajectory. For each
compound (01−49 in Figure 1), the relative frequency of
NACs produced by the docked complexes of the (S)- and (R)-
enantiomer was used to calculate the expected ee% and
compared against the experimentally determined value.
NAC Criteria. NACs were deﬁned by a combination of
geometric parameters important for the transamination
reaction to take place, in particular the nucleophilic proton
abstraction of the external aldimine intermediate to form the
quinonoid intermediate (Scheme 1). In order for Lys285 to
perform a nucleophilic attack on the external aldimine, the

reacting atoms must be positioned at a short distance, where
their van der Waals radii start overlapping (d1). Furthermore,
the cleavable bond H α−Cα needs to be positioned
perpendicular to the Schiﬀ base (χ1 ≈− 90°) to allow the
nascent p orbital to align with the electrons of the PLP-
conjugated π system (χ
2 ≈ 0°). Additionally, the free electrons
of the attacking lysine nitrogen (:NZ) need to be pointing
directly toward H α (θ1, θ2 >9 0°). The complete set of
geometric criteria for a frame to be considered a NAC is listed
in Figure 3. The precise criteria have been found to have a
large inﬂuence on the absolute NAC values but not on the
relative ratios observed between di ﬀerent states that are
compared.

■ RESULTS
General Approach.As outlined inFigure 2, the ﬁrst step
of the approach for predicting the activity ofVf-TA toward a
query compound was to generate enzyme−ligand conforma-
tions by Rosetta docking. The ligand is the external aldimine
intermediate of the query compound. The generated docked
structures were ranked based on the Rosetta interface energy,
and the top-scoring structures (top10% or top20%) were used
as starting conformations for MD simulations. The MD
trajectories (1× 100 ps or 5× 20 ps) were scored based on a
set of geometric parameters. In particular, we looked at the
occurrence of NACs during the trajectories. NACs are ground-
state conformers that lie close to the transition path of a
chemical reaction.
44
For prediction of stereoselectivity, anee% value is obtained
from MD simulations by combining the proportion of NACs
found in the simulation for the (R)- and the (S)-enantiomer,
using the following formula:

We thus use docking algorithms to reach the ground-state
conformations of the external aldimine and MD simulations to
sample the Boltzmann distribution of ground-state conformers
and their propensity to adopt reactive poses. The proportion of
ground-state conformers that are NACs gives an estimate of
the free energy of NAC formation.
45 Comparing the free
energy of NAC formation for the (R)- and (S)-enantiomer
gives a direct estimate of theee%. The use of NAC frequencies
as indication of enzymatic selectivity has been adopted
successfully in previous studies on a variety of enzymes.
36−42,46
For the substrate-range prediction, we found the Rosetta
interface energy between the enzyme and the external aldimine
form of the query compound to be in agreement with the
experimental activities of the whole transamination reaction.
Conversely, there was no apparent correlation between the
percentage of NACs and the enzymatic activity (results not
shown).
Enantioselectivity Predictions with the Benchmark
Compounds. To estimate theee% of compounds01−49, the
best Rosetta structures were selected to serve as starting
conformations for short MD simulations, and the trajectories
were scored by computing the NAC occurrence. The
enantiomeric excess was calculated with eq 1, where the
number of NACs produced by each enantiomer is thought of
as being an indication of the ability of the enantiomer to adopt
a conformation optimal for catalysis. The calculatedee%( ee
%
calc) was then compared against the experimentalee% values
(ee%exp). In most cases, theee%calc matched the expected values
(Table 1).
The high enantioselectivity ofω-TAs is an attractive feature
in the synthesis of chiral amines but also hinders validation of
the presented protocol because the dataset gathered from the
literature is strongly unbalanced. Most of the compounds in
the presented dataset have anee%
exp of around 99%, and the
ee%calc values are correctly predicted to be in this range. The
enantioselectivity calculations situated the numeric ee%calc
values of most compounds as large and positive (a positive
sign means (S)-enantiopreference, and a negative sign means
(R)-enantiopreference), which is in agreement with the highly
(S)-enantioselective nature of Vf-TA (Table 1). Compounds
32, 33, 35, 36, and45 are the exception, but32, 33, and45 are
only designated as (R)-amines because of CIP rules and retain
a similar stereoconﬁguration to (S)-01 (the bulky substituent
binds in the large pocket). By contrast, compounds35 and 36
do not maintain the stereoconﬁguration of (S)-01. Here, theee
%calc for 35 (42%) and36 (9%) was not in agreement with the
ee%exp (−99 and −98%, respectively). While the predictions
incorrectly favor the ( S)-enantiomer, the experiments
suggested that the (R)-enantiomer was preferred in both35
and 36. Theee%exp reported by Höhne et al.51 suggests thatVf-
TA would strongly prefer to place the N-Boc substituent of
compounds 35 and 36 in the small binding pocket to yield the
corresponding amines. Nevertheless, structural analysis of the
docked complexes of ligands35(R/S) and 36(R/S) did not
provide an explanation as to why Vf-TA should prefer one
enantiomer over the other (Figure S1).
Additionally, it can be noted that there are a few compounds
in the dataset with low absoluteee%
exp values (i.e.,34, 40, 41,
45, 47, and 48) that were correctly predicted to have a poor
enantioselectivity. For example, theee%exp of 47 is 15%, which
suggests that Vf-TA does not produce an enantiopure mixture
of amines (ratio of (S)- to (R)-amine is 1.35:1), and theee%calc
has a low absolute value of 56% (3.5:1). On the other hand,
there are a few compounds in the dataset with high absoluteee
%exp values (i.e., 13, 15, 32, 35, 36, 42, and 43) that were
incorrectly predicted to have much loweree%calc values. For
example, the ee%exp of 13 (99%) suggests a strong preference
for the (S)-enantiomer, but the ee%calc (4%) would wrongly
predict thatVf-TA produces both enantiomers in almost equal
amounts. Compounds35 and 36 were discussed earlier, and an
explanation for the failure of the protocol in predicting the
enantiopreference of compounds 13 and 15 could not be
found.
The enantioselectivity predictions for compounds contain-
ing the indan or tetralin moieties (i.e., 32, 40−45) were
generally not in agreement with the reported experimental
values. For example, for compounds 42 and 43, Vf-TA was
expected to have a strong preference toward the ( S)-
enantiomer, but theee%
calc values (1 and−11%, respectively)
suggest no preference. Inspection of the docked structures
provided no explanation for these inaccurate ee%calc values.
Within the tetralin compounds, the ee%calc (−31%) for 40
deviates in 49 percentual points from theee%exp (18%), which
might lead to the conclusion that the prediction for 40 is
incorrect. However, because the enantiomeric excess does not
follow a linear scale, these deviations need to be interpreted
accordingly. The ee%
calc for compound 40 corresponds to a
small enantiopreference for the (R)-enantiomer (enantiomeric
ratio 0.52:1), whereas theee%exp suggests a slight enantiopre-
ference for the ( S)-enantiomer (1.4:1). Accordingly, the

energy deviations suggest that the enantioselectivity calcu-
lations are rather accurate (0.6 kcal/mol deviation), and the
same holds for compounds34, 45, and47. Gawley66 provides
an excellent overview of the limitations of using enantiomeric
excess as a metric to describe the enantiomeric composition.
For that reason, we also calculated theΔΔG‡ deviations from
experimental data (see the Supporting Information for
calculation details). In many cases (26 out of 49), the
deviations are below ±1.0 kcal/mol ( Table 1 ), which
corroborates the predictive power of the presented method-
ology for modeling the enantioselectivity ofω-TAs.
The ability of Arg415 to form salt bridge interaction with
carboxyl groups is corroborated by the enantiopreference of
Vf-TA toward compounds 19 (L-alanine) and 33 (3-
ﬂuoroalanine). Synthesis of (S)-19 and (R)-33 requires placing
the carboxyl substituent in the large binding pocket, where
Arg415 is located (Figure S2). The formation of a salt bridge
between the guanidinium group of Arg145 and the COO
−
group of the ligand to occur, the carboxyl substituent needs to
be deprotonated. In fact, when the simulations (docking and
MD) were performed with the carboxyl groups in the neutral
form (COOH), theee%
calc of compounds19 and 33 was found
to be 76 and −36%, respectively. The results presented in
Table 1 are from simulations with the deprotonated form
(COO−), where the preference is toward salt bridge formation
(ee%calc was 95 and −96% for compounds 19 and 33,
respectively).
Additional Simulation Setups. Additional simulation
setups were used to test the robustness of the presented
protocol (Table S1). We tested whether the number and
length of the simulations (5× 20 ps vs 1× 100 ps), or the
fraction of docked structures selected for MD (top20% vs
top10%), aﬀected the outcome of the calculations. When
comparing the 5 × 20 ps against the 1× 100 ps setups, no
large diﬀerences were found in the predictedee% values. In
fact, NAC-producing frames were found to be evenly spaced
across the MD trajectories (Figure S5), which means that the
percentage of NACs produced by a trajectory was not
dependent on the simulation length. Still, the length of the
simulations should be long enough to generate conformational
sampling of the ground-state region set at the docking stage,
but short enough to maintain a conformation close to the
initial structure. Our research group has previously shown that
ps-scale MD simulations are long enough to allow meaningful
counting of binding poses and that running multiple-
independent MD simulations is better for sampling than
performing a single long simulation.
36,37,46,67 Additionally, no
large diﬀerence was found when comparing theee% obtained
from using the top10% or top20% of Rosetta structures for
MD simulations ( Table S1 ). Again, only low-energy
conformations should be used to avoid working with
unfavorable ground states (unfavorable Rosetta interface
energies), but the structures should be diverse enough to
prevent single outliers from dominating the averaged frequency

of NAC conformations. Within the set of selected structures,
the number of NACs that each trajectory produced was not
correlated with the Rosetta interface energy of the starting
structure (Figure S6). All in all, the choice of limiting the
proportion of docking structures (top20%) to be used as
starting conformations for multiple short MD simulations (5×
20 ps) was adequate.
Sampling of theχ
1 Dihedral Is Key to Modeling the
Enantioselectivity of Vf-TA. In this section, we provide
further results that illustrate why sampling theχ1 dihedral using
the Rosetta energy function can be advantageous.
The most important diﬀerence between the preferred and
nonpreferred enantiomers is that the former can position their
cleavable H
α−Cα bond perpendicular to the PMP plane, ready
for proton abstraction by Lys285. By contrast, the non-
preferred enantiomers cannot position the Hα close to Lys285,
because this would require placing the large substituent in the
small binding pocket, which is unfavorable ( Figure 4 ).
Therefore, the initial approach for modeling the enantiose-
lectivity of Vf-TA was to dock the ligands of compounds01−
49 in a conformation that resembled as much as possible a
catalytic conformation (setting χ
1 to −90°) and allow the
nonpreferred enantiomer to reorient itself into a more
favorable (and probably noncatalytic) conformation during
the simulation (Figure 4A,C). In this way, the fraction of
NACs produced by the nonpreferred enantiomer would be
lower than the fraction produced by the preferred enantiomer
(NAC criteriumχ
1). However, we found that the nonpreferred
enantiomer (i.e., the (R)-enantiomer) was not able to invert to
a more favorable conformation in simulation time scales
realistic for application in rapid computational screening (i.e.,
tens of ps). When the external aldimine form of both
enantiomers was docked in a catalytic orientation ( χ1 =
−90°), followed by MD simulations, the ee%calc showed no
correlation with theee%exp values (Table S1). Hence, docking
all external aldimine intermediates in a catalytic orientation
was unsuitable for discerning between reactive and nonreactive
enantiomers.
Longer MD simulations of the external aldimine complex of
compounds 01R and 01S showed that theχ
1 dihedral evolves
too slowly to obtain convergence in short time scales (Figure
S7). We sorted out this limitation by using the Rosetta energy
function to scan through theχ1 dihedral and produce enzyme−
ligand complexes with staggered χ1 values (χ1 ={ −180°,
−168.75°, −157.50°, ..., +180°}) (Figure 2). The top-scoring
Rosetta structures (top20%: 64 out of 320 total structures;
top10%: 32 out of 320 total structures) were then used as
starting conformations for MD simulations ( Figure 4B,D).
This way, the docking algorithm makes larger jumps in
conformational space, and the short MD simulations
subsequently sample the local region of said conformational
space, yielding a fast and accurate protocol to modelω-TA
enantioselectivity.
Inﬂuence of NAC Deﬁnitions onee%
calc. Among the set
of geometric criteria (d1, θ1, θ2, χ1, andχ2), the dihedralχ1 was
the criterion with greater inﬂuence on the number of NACs
produced in the trajectory because of its slow dynamics. The
MD simulations (20−100 ps) were not of suﬃcient length as
to allow χ
1 to move away from the starting value set at the
docking stage (Figure S3). Hence, ligands docked in a catalytic
conformation ( χ1 = −90°)w e r em o r el i k e l y( b u tn o t

noncatalytic conformation ( χ1 ≠− 90°). Because a ligand
docked in a catalytic conformation is not necessarily
guaranteed to produce NACs (as NAC production also
depends on other geometric parameters), performing MD
simulations on the docked structures is still necessary to
determine ee%
calc. Similarly, a ligand docked in a noncatalytic
conformation is still capable of producing NACs (Figure S4).
Additionally, MD simulations allow the inclusion of explicit
water molecules. All in all, the presented strategy of scanning
the χ
1 dihedral landscape using the Rosetta energy function
and then performing more accurate ps-scale MD simulations of
the top-scoring docked structures enables a fast and accurate
way of modeling the enantioselectivity ofω-TAs.
Substrate Scope Prediction Using the Rosetta Inter-
face Energy. After examining enantioselectivity, we inves-
tigated if the sole modeling of the external aldimine
intermediate would suﬃce to predict the substrate range. Six
independent sets of substrates were examined. Theﬁrst three
sets keep the query compound constant but explore diﬀerent
Vf-TA variants (Figure 5A−C), and the remaining three sets
keep the enzyme variant constant but explore di ﬀerent
compounds (Figure 5D−F). The Rosetta interface energy
was found to be well correlated with the observed experimental
activity for the six independent sets of compounds, once major
outliers were omitted from the latter three datasets. The
correlation is surprising because the interface energy only
accounts for interactions between the ligand and the protein
while ignoring other factors that may cause di ﬀerences in
catalytic activity, such as diﬀerences in the chemical potential
of the reacting compounds or in desolvation free energy upon
substrate binding across substrates or mutants.
68 Calculating
only the interface energy of the external aldimine complex also
ignores other steps in the catalytic cycle for a given substrate to
undergo transamination, such as formation of the Michaelis
complex or formation of reaction intermediates other than the
external aldimine. However, because all these reaction
intermediates are structurally similar ( Scheme 1), a good
interaction energy for the modeled intermediate might also
reﬂect a good interaction energy for the nonmodeled
intermediates. Whereas substrate binding (a ﬃnity) would
mainly inﬂuence K
M, the aﬃnity of an intermediate can also
inﬂuence kcat, which would be in agreement with inspecting the
relationship between the Rosetta interface energy and
experimental data, namely, yield and conversion. Another
point to consider is the scale on which the observed correlation
between Rosetta scores and enz ymatic activity exhibits
monotonicity. On short scales, two mutants with di ﬀerent
activities may receive a similar Rosetta score (e.g., mutants
m10 and m12 inFigure 5A, m3 vs m12 and m5 inFigure 5B,
and H3RV vs H3R in Figure 5C). Despite these potential
pitfalls, the good correlation found between interface energies
and experimental substrate speciﬁcity suggests that the Rosetta
score can be used as the objective function to guide the design
of ω-TA mutants.
■ DISCUSSION
Modeling the enzymatic enantioselectivity is a complicated
task because of the small energy diﬀerences that need to be
reproduced and the number of intermediates and transition
states that need to be considered. Very accurate but
computationally demanding methods, such as quantum
mechanics (QM), molecular mechanics, empirical valence
bond, and the quantum chemical cluster approach, have been
used successfully in the study of enzymatic enantioselectivity.
69
In this work, we explored a strategy that combines molecular
docking and MD simulations to yield a computationally
inexpensive but accurate framework for predicting the
speciﬁcity of Vf-TA in the production of chiral amines.
Modeling was performed using only the external aldimine
intermediate of the query compounds. Docking allows a
computationally eﬃcient generation of ground-state conforma-
tions, while the MD simulations quantify the Boltzmann
distribution of ground-state conformers, including the
occurrence of reactive poses. Estimating the proportion of
ground-state conformers that resemble a NAC provides an
indication of the free energy of NAC formation
45 and a direct
means for predicting theee%( Eq 1). The MD simulations are
intended to account for the loss of accuracy arising from the
discreteness of rotamers of docking approaches70,71 and the
lack of explicit water molecules.72 The computational cost of
the presented framework is around 37 CPU-h (using an HP
workstation Z4 with Intel Xeon W-2135 Processor with six
CPUs) per assayed compound (setup: 5× 20 ps, top20%), and
parallel computing is possible.
With six independent compound sets, it was shown that the
Rosetta interface energy, measured between the enzyme
variant and the external aldimine form of the query compound,
correlates well with the experimental substrate scope ofVf-TA
(Figure 5). At least for the presented datasets, this correlation
shows that modeling the amino donor (typically
L-alanine or
isopropylamine) is not necessary for the reactivity prediction
task, in contrast to the approach of Seo et al.,
49 where
diﬀerential binding energies were considered for the substrates
of both half-transamination reactions. We recently also
reported the correlation between interface energies and
experimental conversion in otherVf-TA and Pj-TA datasets
73
and used the Rosetta interface energy as the target function for
the computational engineering of thePj-TA substrate scope.68
The protocol allowed the rapid design of Pj-TA variants
accepting sterically hindered substrates. The computational
cost of scanning for enzyme variants using Rosetta interface
energy is circa 2 CPU-h per enzyme variant. Generating every
enzyme−ligand structure takes approximately 60 s, but
producing at least 100 structures per scanned variant is
recommended. Other more sophisticated methodologies for
predicting ω-TA reactivity can be useful in later stages of the
search for new mutants but tend to be more expensive. For
example, the methodology of Voss et al.,
13 which used a
combination of QM calculations and MD simulations, has a
computational cost of around 60 CPU-h per enzyme variant.
Although validation was made solely on aVf-TA dataset, the
presented approach may be applicable to other (S)-selective ω-
TAs owing to their similarities. We have tested the substrate
scope prediction task inPj-TA
68,73 and Cv-TA.73 In contrast,
this approach may or may not be applicable to (R)-selective ω-
TAs, because the two enzymes evolved separately and belong
to a completely diﬀerent PLP fold type (fold type IV).

■ CONCLUSIONS
We presented a framework for calculating the enantioselectiv-
ity of anω-TA fromV. fluvialis toward a variety of compounds.
The framework is computationally inexpensive and can assist
in the enzyme design ofω-TAs. In general, the retrospectively
predicted ee% values were in agreement with those found in
the literature, but there were cases where the predictions did
not correspond to the expected values. Furthermore, we

showed that the Rosetta interface energy of the external
aldimine complex is a good predictor of the activity ofVf-TA
across mutants or across di ﬀerent compounds. Using the
Rosetta interface energy as the target scoring function can
therefore aid in the search for enzyme variants with a
broadened substrate range.
