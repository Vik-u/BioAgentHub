Biobased furans have emerged as chemical building blocks for the develop-
ment of materials because of their diverse scaffolds and as they can be directly
prepared from sugars. However, selective, efﬁcient, and cost-effective scalable
conversion of biobased furans remains elusive. Here, we report a robust
transaminase (TA) fromShimia marina(SMTA) that enables the scalable
amination of biobased furanaldehydes with high activity and broad substrate
speciﬁcity. Crystallographic and mutagenesis analyses provide mechanistic
insights and a structural basis for understanding SMTA, which enables a higher
substrate conversion. The enzymatic cascade process established in this study
allows one-pot synthesis of 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)furan (BAMF) and5-(amino-
methyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid from5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The biosynth-
esis of various furfurylamines, including a one-pot cascade reaction for BAMF
generation using whole cells, demonstrates their practical application in the
pharmaceutical and polymer industries.

Biomass is one of the best organic carbon sources and is equivalent to
petroleum for fuels, biopolymers, andﬁne commodity chemicals, with
net zero carbon emissions4,5. In particular, the biomass-derived5-
hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been called a“sleeping giant” of
sustainable chemistry owing to its enormous synthetic potential and
high reactivity and can be further transformed into numerous high-
valued derivatives. For example,2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid, an oxi-
dation product of HMF, has been utilized to produce polyethylene
furandicarboxylate, which is a 100% renewable alternative to poly(-
ethylene terephthalate)
5.
Furfurylamines are promising precursors of bio-renewable poly-
mers, such as polyamides, polyimides, and polyureas, and have
potential applications as intermediates in the manufacturing of phar-
maceuticals, such as antiseptic and antihypertensive agents
6–8.P o l y -
meric Schiff bases made of furans are potential biobased polymers,
exhibiting intriguing properties due to their dynamic nature linked to
covalent bonds and an improved oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor barrier, conferring better mechanical properties and enhanced
thermal stability. These propertiesconfer novel qualities to the cor-
responding biomaterials

mine derivative of furan, is an outstanding monomer for the synthesis
of amine-containing polymers, such as polyurethanes and

synthesis of furfurylamines via chemocatalytic pathways frequently
requires protective groups, harsh reductive agents, and multiple steps,
thereby being less economical
15,16. Therefore, developing a methodol-
ogy to produce furfurylamines in large quantities would help broaden
their use for polymer and pharmaceutic syntheses. To achieve this,
biocatalysts are an efﬁcient option because they tend to direct reac-
tions toward speci ﬁc products more selectively under mild
conditions
17–20. Recent advances inω-transaminase- (ω-TA)-mediated
biocatalytic pathways have attracted widespread attention for their
application in furfurylamine biosynthesis5,8,21–23. However, their indus-
trial application is hindered by several factors, including equilibrium
thermodynamics, product inhibition, poor substrate tolerance, low
product recovery, and the excessive use of alanine amino donors, even
when using alanine regeneration systems
21–24. Moreover, no methods
for the biocatalytic synthesis of BAMF and MAFCA from HMF have yet
been developed owing to the lack of an efﬁcient and selective oxida-
tion method to obtain the corresponding aldehydes/acids without the
formation of undesired by-products. Therefore, the development of
highly efﬁcient and selective biocatalytic systems for these conver-
sions remains challenging.
Herein, we report a robust transaminase (TA) derived fromShimia
marina (SMTA) that efﬁciently aminates biobased furan aldehydes
with high catalytic activity (Fig.1a). We also demonstrate a one-pot
multi-enzymatic reaction for generating BAMF and MAFCA from HMF,
which includes an in situ cofactor-recycling system containing an
aldehyde reductase fromSynechocystis sp. PCC 6906 (SAHR). We
further performed a whole-cell-based biosynthesis of various furan-
based amines, including the efﬁcient conversion of HMF to BAMF. This
approach, comprising productive biocatalysts and methodologies,
constitutes an effective and high-yield system for the production of
diverse furfurylamines from biobased furans.
Results
Screening TAs for furan-based aldehyde conversion
To study the conversion of furan-based aldehydes into their corre-
sponding amines, the substrate speciﬁcity of an in-house library of
whole cells individually expressing 30 TAs was screened using HMF,
DFF, and5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA); 96-well plates; and
2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine (NPD)
25 as the amine donor (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Five (S)-amine TAs CVTA, ATTA, VPTA, SMTA, and
VFTA (TAs fromChromobacterium violaceum, Agrobacterium tumefa-
ciens, Variovorax paradoxus, Shimia marina,a n d Vibrio ﬂuvialis
respectively) exhibited strong coloration (Fig.1b). In contrast, the
control reaction without an amine acceptor resulted in a faint orange

color due to the small amount of remaining intracellular pyruvate,
which was different from that of the reaction containing furan-based
aldehydes (Supplementary Fig. 1). In particular, CVTA is an efﬁcient
catalyst for furfurylamine synthesis8,26. Then, a new set of experiments
was designed using selected puriﬁed TAs containing various amino
donors and higher substrate concentrations (HMF, DFF, and FFCA; 50
and 100 mM) (Supplementary Figs. 2–5). Among the tested TAs, SMTA
was the most efﬁcient biocatalyst when isopropylamine (IPA) was used
as an amino donor, completely converting the selected furan alde-
hydes into the corresponding amines (100 mM). IPA is an ideal amino
donor because both IPA and its co-product acetone are cost-effective
and volatile, enabling an easier scale-up and product isolation
27.
The kinetic experiments using SMTA revealed higher catalytic
efﬁciencies, with catalytic constant (kcat) for HMF, FFCA, and furfural of
2.5, 33.3, and 28.1 s−1 respectively, and very high substrate afﬁnities (the
KM of HMF, FFCA, and furfural was 0.74, 0.59, and 0.75 mM, respec-
tively). Determining the amount of monoaminated product in the case
of DFF was not possible because it was unstable during the synthetic
investigations, forming complex polymerization mixtures via imine
formation
8.
The effect of pH on SMTA activity was determined in different
buffer solutions (100 mM) (Supplementary Fig. 6). SMTA was active at
pH 6.5–9.5, with optimum activity at pH 8.0 in Tris-HCl buffer. SMTA
retained 52% activity when the pH was increased to 9.5. To examine the
applicability of SMTA at high substrate loadings, transamination using
IPA as the amino donor was investigated (Supplementary Tables 3–5).
The reactions yielded an efﬁcient amination of up to 500 mM for HMF
and FFCA, and 400 mM for furfural using puriﬁed SMTA (Table1).
Although the selectivity towards DFF was far less satisfactory because
of the high propensity of diamine products to polymerize with dia-
ldehydes (Supplementary Fig. 10), the selected SMTA led to a BAMF
formation of 90% from 50 mM DFF, whereas the reaction with 100 mM
DFF resulted in the formation of 65 mM BAMF using 0.5 mg/mL SMTA.
Notably, DFF transamination with SMTA resulted in the complete
consumption of the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 8). To further
enhance the BAMF formation from DFF, we examined the effects of
various water-miscible cosolvents, as well as enzyme concentrations
(Supplementary Figs. 10–13). A BAMF formation of 87%, a promising
result, was observed when using 10% DMSO, 2.0 mg/mL SMTA and
100 mM DFF substrate. The residual activity of SMTA was investigated
in the presence of an amine acceptor (FFCA, 100/200 mM) with an
excess supply of amine donor (IPA, 1 M) to assess the operational
stability. The residual activity of SMTA remained above 90% for 1 h but
the activity decreased to 74% and 54% after 6 h in 100 mM and 200 mM
of FFCA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 14).
Then, the substrate scope of SMTA was examined, and DFF, FFCA,
and furfural showed higher activity than HMF (706 ± 20 mU/mg)
(Fig. 1c). This activity value was higher than that obtained for CVTA
(Supplementary Table 6). While the -Br substitution at the 5-position of
furfural led to a 1.7-fold higher activity than that of HMF, the sub-
stitution of -Br at the 4-position reduced the activity by 0.80-fold. The
activity resulting from the -Cl substitution at the 5-position of furfural
was 0.84-fold lower than that of HMF. In addition, the methyl, ethyl,
and propyl side chain substitutions at the 5-position of furan resulted
in activities that were 2.5-, 1.4-, and 2-fold higher than those obtained
from HMF.
Crystal structure of SMTA
To elucidate the structural basis for the remarkable activity and sta-
bility of SMTA, we determined the crystal structure of this enzyme in
the presence of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP). X-ray diffraction data
were collected from SMTA crystals at a resolution of 2.14 Å, and the
crystal structure was determined via molecular replacement and
reﬁned to aR
work/Rfree of 0.176/0.216 (Supplementary Table 7). Based
on the size exclusion chromatography results, SMTA was assumed to
function as a homodimer in solution. One copy of dimeric SMTA was
present in an asymmetric unit of the crystal and no notable packing
interactions with symmetry-related neighboring molecules were
observed. The overall structure of SMTA and its interaction with PLP
were highly similar to those of other dimeric TAs
28,29 (Fig. 2a). The
apparent electron density indicated a Schiff base between PLP and the
catalytic lysine K291 (Fig.2c).
Notably, all residues, except for the N-terminal methionine (Met1)
in the reﬁned structure of both protomers of the SMTA dimer, dis-
played interpretable electron density, considering that the N-terminal
regions of dimeric TAs are not conserved and are not visible in other
structures, probably because of their conformationalﬂexibility (Sup-
plementary Fig. 15). Notably, the N-terminal region of each SMTA
protomer was expected to play a role in the dimer interactions through
additional contact with the other protomer (Fig.2b). As the dimeric
form is the functional unit, TA dissociation into monomers can lead to
protein unfolding. Mutations in the N-terminal residues reduced the
thermal stability of SMTA, determined using differential scanning
ﬂuorimetry (Supplementary Fig. 16). The double mutant, I4G and N6D,
which can disrupt the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond
with the other protomer, lowered the melting temperature (T
m)b y
19 °C, probably due to the loss of the interactions (Fig.2b). Replacing
L13 with tryptophan reduced the thermal stability of SMTA by lowering
the Tm by 19 °C, probably by weakening the dimeric interaction. In the
CVTA structure, the N-terminal region is invisible, implying the
absence of any interaction involving this region. The N-terminal region
of CVTA could not bend toward the dimeric interface owing to the
steric hindrance by the large size of the corresponding residue W10
(Supplementary Fig. 17). Since the N-terminal region, including L13 of
SMTA, is not conserved among transaminases, it is likely related to the
different stability and activity of each transaminase, albeit in a minor
way (Supplementary Fig. 15). The temperature dependency of the
SMTA activity in the wild-type and double mutant, I4G and N6D, was
investigated after incubation at different temperatures (25–70 °C) for
1 hr (Supplementary Fig. 18a). SMTA maintained >97% residual activity
till 37 °C for 1 hr. Notably, incubation of SMTA with 0.1 mM PLP
resulted in the retainment of >98% residual activity until 50 °C for 1 hr.
However, the N-terminal double mutant I4G and N6D resulted in a
signiﬁcant loss of residual activity (54% at 37 °C). Even in the presence
of 0.1 mM PLP, the I4G and N6D double mutant exhibited maximal
residual activity of 61% at 37 °C and 12% at 50 °C. We investigated the
residual activity by prolonging the incubation of enzymes at 50 °C
(Supplementary Fig. 18b). SMTA retained substantial residual activity
(51%) after 3 hr, while the I4G and N6D double mutant showed a
complete loss of residual activity after 3 hr of incubation at 50 °C.
In SMTA, the pyridinium nitrogen in PLP forms an ionic interac-
tion with the side chain of D262, which is conserved in other TAs. The
conformation of D262 in SMTA is supported by a hydrogen bond
network involving N127 and N130 (Fig.2d). However, the CVTA resi-
dues at the equivalent positions, V124 and M127, cannot form such an
interaction network. The cofactor release assay showed that the N127V

mutant signiﬁcantly decreased the binding afﬁnity of both PLP and
PMP compared to that of wild-type SMTA (Supplementary Fig. 19). The
N130M mutant could not be evaluated because it was expressed in a
completely insoluble form inE. coli. This mutation may hinder protein
folding through a putative clash of the mutated methionine with sur-
rounding residues of SMTA, which are not conserved in CVTA. The
hydrogen-bond network mediated by N127 and N130 in SMTA may
facilitate the ionic interaction between D262 and its cofactor by opti-
mally positioning D262, and thereby preventing the release of PLP and
PMP during the catalytic cycle. Other transaminases, including VFTA
(Vibrio ﬂuvialis TA), HETA (Halomonas elongateTA), and PPTA (Pseu-
domonas putidaTA), contain an asparagine residue at N127 in SMTA,
whereas N130 of SMTA shows little conservation among transaminases
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, this hydrogen-bond network mediated
by N130, N127, and D262 could be a unique characteristic of SMTA,
which provides a preformed structure for optimal interaction with the
cofactors. Cofactor loss in dimeric TAs induces a signiﬁcant structural
rearrangement within the dimer interface, thereby promoting dimer
dissociation and the unfolding of the enzyme into an irreversibly
inactivated state
30–32. Thus, the high activity and robustness of SMTA,
even in the presence of high substrate concentration, can be attributed
in part to its unique structural features, including the role of the
N-terminal region in reinforcing the dimer interaction and the ability of
the hydrogen-bond network to prevent cofactor leakage from the
enzyme.
Molecular basis for the catalytic activity of SMTA
The docking structure of SMTA with the external aldimine inter-
mediate of PLP-HMF was modeled using its crystal structure to provide
molecular insights into the high activity and broad substrate speciﬁcity
of SMTA. In the hypothetical structure, the furan ring moiety of PLP-
HMF is surrounded by hydrophobic residues from the two protomers
of the SMTA dimer via van der Waals interactions (Fig.3). Furthermore,
t h eo x y g e na t o mi nt h ef u r a nr i n gf o r m sah y d r o g e nb o n dw i t ht h es i d e
chain of W63. The high activity of SMTA toward furfural may be
attributed to these interactions, which enable an efﬁcient binding to
the furan ring of the substrates.
The active site of SMTA contains sufﬁcient space to accommodate
various furan derivatives, particularly those substituted at the 4 and 5
positions (Fig.3c). When PLP-HMF was overlaid on the active site of
CVTA while maintaining the interactions with the PLP moiety, the furan
ring sterically collided with the CVTA surface. This collision was pri-
marily due to the switch-in conformation of R416 in CVTA. TAs often
adopt an arginine switch strategy for dual speciﬁcity, accepting both
negatively charged and neutral substrates at the same site
33,34. Car-
boxylated substrates form bidentate salt bridges with the arginine
residue in a canonical switch-in conformation, whereas large aromatic
substrates can be accommodated by moving the arginine residue from
the active site. In the structure of CVTA in complex with PLP, R416
assumed a switch-in conformation, which was stabilized by a water-
mediated hydrogen bond to Y168 (Supplementary Fig. 20). In the
SMTA structure, the switch-out conformation of R418 in both proto-
mers was stabilized by stacking interactions with R407 and F92. The
optimal conformation of R407 for the stacking interaction is sup-
ported by its ionic interaction with E408, whereas the equivalent
residue in CVTA, D406, tilts the R405 conformation. Moreover, the
I425 residue may sterically interfere with the putative switch-in con-
formation of R418 in SMTA, since I425 has an extraδ-carbon compared
to the V423 residue of CVTA. This switch-in conformation of CVTA
would not be readily compatible with the binding of the PLP-HMF
intermediate owing to this steric occlusion (Fig.3c; Supplementary
Figs. 20, 21). A signiﬁcant catalytic activity reduction was observed in

the SMTA mutants whose residues were altered to CVTA, which
destabilized and stabilized the switch-out and switch-in conformation
of R418, respectively. This suggests that the preference of SMTA for
the switch-out arginine conformation may contribute to the high
activity and broad speciﬁcity of the enzyme for various furfural types
as amino acceptors (Supplementary Fig. 22). The switch-out con-
formation of SMTA creates a wide substrate binding site, allowing
ready accessibility to both amino donors, alanine and IPA. However,
the switch-in conformation in CVTA may facilitate the ideal positioning
of alanine’s carboxylic group, thereby establishing alanine as a more
favorable amino donor than IPA (Supplementary Fig. 4). As expected,
the experiment to assess the initial reaction rate demonstrated that the
relative preference for alanine over IPA is more signiﬁcant in CVTA
(3.4-fold higher) than in SMTA (1.5-fold higher) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 23).
Investigation of CVTA structures revealed that R416 of CVTA
adopted diverse conformations depending on the enzyme’ss t a t e ,s u c h
as the apo, PLP-bound, PMP-bound, and mutant forms (Supplementary
Fig. 24). Most CVTA structures feature R416 in switch-in conforma-
tions, except for the W60C mutant. In the W60C mutant, one proto-
mer of the dimeric enzyme allows Arg416 to adopt a complete switch-
out conformation similar to SMTA, while the other protomer maintains
a switch-in conformation. The mutation, W60C, boosts CVTA’ss p e c iﬁc
activity for some substrates, suggesting its effect on electrochemical
properties in addition to making more space in the active site
35,36.
W60C may contribute to the higher activity of the enzyme by
increasing the population of the enzyme with a switch-out
conformation of R416. However, the mechanism through which this
mutation induces the switch-out conformation in the enzyme remains
unclear. Subtle variations in transamidases’ active sites might affect
the conformational equilibrium of their switchable arginine residue,
which in turn could inﬂuence their catalytic properties.
Cascade catalysis for selective BAMF and MAFCA generation
from HMF
In principle, BAMF and MAFCA can be enzymatically synthesized by
the amination of HMF-oxidized DFF and FFCA, the chemical or bio-
catalytic synthesis of which is challenging37,38. Recently, Turner et al.
engineered a galactose oxidase enzyme (Variant GOM7-2A)t h a tc a nb e
used in organic solvent/buffer biphasic systems at a high substrate
concentration for the oxidation of HMF to DFF
37. To catalyze the initial
step of this oxidation, the reaction was tested at different HMF con-
centrations up to 500 mM using DMSO as a cosolvent and a biocata-
lytic system comprising GO
M7-2A, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and
catalase (Supplementary Table 8). The complete conversion of HMF to
DFF was achieved up to a substrate concentration of 200 mM but
decreased to 90%, 76%, and 70% as the substrate concentration of 300,
400, and 500 mM, respectively. To catalyze the conversion of HMF to
BAMF, we performed a one-pot reaction employing SMTA using a
developed biocatalytic system (GO
M7-2A, HRP, and catalase). However,
an equimolar conversion of the HMF substrate (50 mM) to5-hydro-
xymethylfurfurylamine (HMFA) (48%) and BAMF (52%) was observed
after 18 h, and the BAMF concentration did not increase further until
48 h (Supplementary Fig. 26). This equimolar conversion can be

attributed to the multifaceted substrate HMF, which serves as a com-
mon substrate for both SMTA and GOM7-2A. Furthermore, the accu-
mulated HMFA could not be oxidized by GOM7-2A,indicating the lack of
speciﬁcity of GOM7-2A toward HMFA. Therefore, the selective conver-
sion of HMF into BAMF was achieved in two sequential one-pot reac-
tion steps. In theﬁrst step, the HMF substrate was completely oxidized
to DFF using a GO
M7-2A, HRP, and catalase system, followed by the
SMTA-mediated transamination of the generated DFF into BAMF.
Notably, the complete conversion of HMF to DFF is important for the
selective synthesis of BAMF since separating the remnant amination
byproduct of HMF (i.e., HMFA) from BAMF is challenging. After the
completion of theﬁrst step, the reaction was diluted to achieve aﬁnal
substrate (DFF) concentration of 50 mM. This one-pot, two-step
reaction using 100 to 200 mM of HMF led to a production of the
intermediate DFF > 99%, which was subsequently aminated to produce
87% of BAMF in the second step (Fig.4a; Table2). However, increasing
the initial substrate concentration of HMF to 300 mM resulted in a 76%
conversion to BAMF with a 10% formation of HMFA as a byproduct.
The synthesis of MAFCA from HMF was achieved by generating
FFCA, a partially oxidized derivative of HMF containing a carboxylic
acid group and a formyl group
5 (Fig. 1a). The synthesis of FFCA is
challenging because of its highly oxidized yet incomplete state. How-
ever, biocatalysts capable of producing FFCA are scarce. Therefore,
numerous biocatalysts were screened for the conversion of the HMF

substrate to the desired FFCA (Supplementary Table 9). The screened
enzymes exhibited a substrate scope toward aliphatic and aromatic
alcohols. Most enzymes showed activity toward HMF to produce
5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid (HMFCA); however, none could directly
produce FFCA from HMF. Alternatively, FFCA could be obtained by
oxidizing the HMFCA intermediate. The GO
M7-2A variant showed
excellent activity in generating FFCA, leading to a conversion of >99%
using 50 and 100 mM of the HMFCA substrate (Supplementary
Table 10). However, the multi-enzymatic FFCA generation from HMF is
technically challenging by utilizing two oxidases, especially at high
substrate concentrations due to the lower availability of O
2 in the
reaction solutions, especially at high temperatures (0.26 mM at
25 °C)
38,39. Unlike oxidases, DHs typically use nicotinamide cofactors
instead of O2 to oxidize substrates. Hemoproteins/oxidases can
regenerate NAD(P)+ for DH-catalyzed oxidations38,40,41.T h ec o m b i n a -
tion of the DH fromSynechocystissp. (SADH) with an oxidase can be
used to produce FFCA from HMF38.T oi d e n t i f ye fﬁcient DHs, we tested
t h ea l d e h y d er e d u c t a s eS A H R( S u pplementary Figs. 28 and 29). The
SADH-combined GOM7-2A-HRP-catalase system produced 43 mM of the
desired FFCA and 7 mM of the DFF intermediate from 50 mM of HMF
within 24 h. However, SAHR combined with GO
M7-2A-HRP-catalase
resulted in the complete formationof the desired FFCA within 6 h. The
applicability of this cascade reaction was further evaluated at a larger
scale, using 100 mM of HMF, for which 58 mM of FFCA was obtained
and 9 and 31 mM of the HMFCA and DFF intermediates, respectively,
were formed. The selectivity of SAHR toward the HMF and DFF sub-
strates was tested (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). The SAHR-based
reaction with DFF yielded 20%FFCA, 10% HMFCA, and 19% HMF.
Notably, no overoxidation of FFCA was observed, indicating that the
GO
M7-2A/SAHR system-based oxidation of HMF could be controlled to
obtain the desired amount of FFCA. To drive the reaction equilibrium
by efﬁciently regenerating NAD(P)
+, the HMF to FFCA reaction was
performed by combining the NADPH oxidase fromLactobacillus reu-
teri (LreNOX)42–44 with the SAHR-GOM7-2A-HRP-catalase system. The
reaction using 100 mM of HMF led to a 99% conversion of HMF: mostly
into the desired FFCA product (63%), but also into the DFF inter-
mediate (39%) (Supplementary Table 13). Because the formation of
FFCA resulted in a drop in the pH of the reaction mixture down to a pH
of 6.5, the effect of increasing the buffering capacity of NaPi from 50 to
500 mM was evaluated (Supplementary Table 14). Increasing the buf-
fer capacity to 200 mM drastically improved the conversion toward
the desired product, resulting in the complete conversion of HMF to
FFCA. Notably, the reaction without NOX proceeded well and resulted

at an HMF concentration of 300 mM, the tandem oxidation yielded up
to 73% of FFCA. To catalyze the conversion of HMF to MAFCA, we
performed a one-pot reaction by combining SMTA with a newly
developed oxidation system (GO
M7-2A,H R P ,c a t a l a s e ,a n dS A H R ) .H M F
( 5 0 m M )y i e l d e d4 0 %o fH M F Aa n d6 0 %o fB A M F( S u p p l e m e n t a r y
Table 15), demonstrating that the GO
M7-2A and SAHR variants lack
speciﬁcity toward HMFA oxidation. A sequential one-pot, two-step
reaction was performed (Fig.4b). In theﬁrst step, the oxidation of HMF
to FFCA was completed before the second transamination step. This
stepwise reaction produced MAFCA from 200 mM of HMF, yielding a
conversion >99% (Table2).
Whole-cell-based generation of furfurylamines
Whole-cell biotransformations are advantageous because of their low
downstream requirements and better enzyme stability45. To minimize
the rapid endogenous conversion of aldehydes into their corre-
sponding alcohols, we tested an engineeredE. colistrain with reduced
aromatic aldehyde reduction (RARE)
46. The whole-cell-based transa-
mination reactions of HMF and furfural (at a 100–500 mM con-
centration) using the BL-21 and RARE strains were compared. The
amination conversion capacity was signiﬁcantly higher in SMTA-
overexpressed RARE than in BL-21 cells. HMF (400 mM) (Fig.4c) and
furfural (300 mM) (Supplementary Fig. 33) were successfully aminated
using RARE cells (9 mg
CDW/mL) expressing SMTA and IPA amino
donors. The enhanced biotransamination obtained in RARE cells
(Fig. 4d) was likely associated with the minimized futile conversion of
aldehyde to alcohol47. The RARE strain overexpressing SMTA was
selected to transform FFCA and DFF. Using FFCA as a substrate
(400 mM) led to a conversion into MAFCA > 99%, whereas using
100 mM of DFF led to a 95% conversion into BAMF (Table 16; Supple-
mentary Figs. 35 and 36). The reduced mass transfer of AMFC/BAMF
within whole cells led to a reduced interaction with DFF, thereby
leading to a higher formation of BAMF than of the puriﬁed enzyme.
We then performed further experiments on the oxidation of HMF
to DFF in whole cells. Initially, GO
M7-2A was overexpressed in RARE cells
used to oxidize HMF at 50 and 100 mM without the addition of catalase
or HRP (Supplementary Table 17). The reaction using 50 mM of HMF
led to the conversion into DFF without the formation of overoxidation/
reduction side products. Whereas the reaction with 100 mM of HMF
led to the formation of 64 mM of DFF with 34 mM of remaining HMF
and >1 mM of overoxidized FFCA. This satisfactory conversion may also
be attributed to the presence of inherent catalases inE. coli

reactivates GO, likely by utilizing the H2O2 formed during the reaction
and enhancing the GO activity to shorten the conversion time in a
biocatalytic reaction
49. Unfortunately, the active expression of HRP in
microbial cells is complex50. Sushma et al. effectively produced active
HRP fused withE. coliphosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and co-expressed
it with ferrochelatase (FC) inE. coli cells51. To establish RARE cells
expressing functional GO, the pET24ma plasmid encoding GOM7-2Aand
the pETduet-1 plasmid encoding PGK-HRP in MCS-1 cells and FC in
MCS-2 cells were constructed, transformed, and overexpressed (Sup-
plementary Fig. 37). RARE whole cells co-expressing functional GO
M7-2A
with HRP converted 100 mM of HMF into 74 mM of DFF. The use of
DMSO 10% (v/v) increased the conversion to 82% (Supplementary
Fig. 38). Because the complete saturation of GO
M7-2Awith Cu2+ is critical
for the activity of GO49, the addition of 0.2 mM of Cu2+ improved the
DFF formation by up to 93% (Supplementary Table 19; Supplementary
Fig. 39). The sequestration of Cu2+ by cell proteins and the NaPi buffer is
a more likely explanation for the enhanced product formation
regarding the optimal CuSO
4 concentration. Nevertheless, increasing
the HMF concentration to 200 mM led to the formation of 60% DFF
and <1% overoxidized FFCA as a side product.
Subsequently, the reaction was combined with transamination to
produce the desired BAMF. This one-pot two-step reaction using 50
and 100 mM of HMF produced 87% and 85% (Fig.4e) of the desired
BAMF, respectively. Finally, to demonstrate the practical utility of the
whole-cell-based multi-enzymatic process for generating BAMF, we
carried out a one-pot preparative-scale reaction (100 mL) using
100 mM (1.26 gm) of HMF, which led to the formation of 92% of DFF.
The SMTA-catalyzed transamination of the DFF intermediate resulted
in the formation of 85% of theﬁnal BAMF product.
Discussion
Furan-based amines are potential biobased monomers that are utilized
in the production of several promising biopolymers and intermediates
in the pharmaceutical and food industries
6–8. Owing to the challenges
associated with the available biocatalysts and the complexity of con-
trolling the oxidation status, efﬁcient and scalable methods for the
production of diverse furfurylamines remain rare. To the best of our
knowledge, theﬁnding of SMTA is useful for the scalable amination of
various biobased furan aldehydes at higher concentrations using IPA,
which is an affordable amino donor with excellent catalytic activity and
broad substrate scope toward substituted furfurals.
The crystal structure and molecular basis for the higher catalytic
activity of SMTA offer an important precedent that can be applied for
further engineering of TAs whose practical application is challenging.
The elucidated 3D structure of SMTA reveals unique characteristics,
such as the role of the N-terminal region in dimerization and the
ability of the hydrogen-bond network to prevent cofactor leaks,
which leads to better SMTA operational stability. In addition, the
switch-out conformation of R418 at the active site contributes to the
high activity and broad speciﬁcity of SMTA toward various furfurals;
these characteristics can be harnessed to devise new TAs with
superior functionality.
In addition, we developed a one-pot enzymatic cascade reaction
for generating BAMF and MAFCA from HMF. The developed oxidative
multi-enzymatic cascade reaction with a novel SAHR combined with
GO
M7-2A,H R P ,a n dc a t a l a s e ,b a s e do na ni ns i t uN A D ( P )+ recycling
system, provides complete and controlled access for FFCA formation
at higher HMF concentrations. The demonstrated whole-cell method
for creating diverse furfural amines using a one-pot oxidative cascade
reaction by co-expressing active HRP and GO
M7-2A in the RARE strain
efﬁciently synthesized DFF from HMF and subsequently produced
BAMF via amination, which further demonstrates its practical appli-
cations. Collectively, these results highlight the potential to tackle
challenging problems associated with the broader utilization of bio-
based furans in polymer and pharmaceutical syntheses.
Methods
One hundred milliliter scale cascade biotransformation
GOM7-2A and PGK-HRP with FC were co-expressed in the RARE strain
and harvested using NaPi buffer (pH 7.4, 100 mM). The reaction
components included co-overexpressed GOM7-2A and PGK-HRP with
FC (18 mgCDW/mL) RARE cells, HMF (100 mM), CuSO4 (0.2 mM), DMSO
(10%), and NaPi (pH 7.4, 100 mM). The total volume of the reaction was
100 mL. The reaction was performed in a reactor with sufﬁcient
headspace. After adding HMF, the reaction was initiated at 20 °C and
350 rpm. Oxygen in the headspace of the reaction vessel was refreshed
by opening it every 4 hr. After the maximum conversion of the reaction
was reached (monitored using HPLC, as described in the SI), the
reaction was diluted by half by adding SMTA- overexpressed RARE
cells (9 mg
CDW/mL), IPA (1 M), and NaPi buffer (pH 7.4, 100 mM). After
completing the reaction (monitored using HPLC), the reaction was
quenched using an amount of methanol that was twofold in excess,
and the denatured protein was removed via centrifugation (4416 ×g at
4 °C for 30 min). The supernatant, which contained the organic layer,
was removed under reduced pressure. The isolation process is
described in the Supplementary Methods.
