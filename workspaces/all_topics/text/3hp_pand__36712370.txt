Abstract
Carbon fixation is a critical process for our planet; however, its distribution across the bacterial and archaeal domains of life has
not been comprehensively studied. Here, we performed an analysis of 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes and discover carbon
fixation pathways in 1,007bacteria and archaea.Wereveal the genomic potential for carbon fixation throughthe reverse tricarboxylic
acid cycle in previously unrecognized archaeal and bacterial phyla (i.e.Thermoplasmatota and Elusimicrobiota) and show that the 3-
hydroxypropionate bi-cycle is not, as previously thought, restricted to the phylumChloroflexota. The data also substantially expand
the phylogenetic breadth for autotrophy through the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle.
Finally, the genomic potential for carbon fixation through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, previously exclusively
foundin Archaea,wasalsodetectedinthe Bacteria.Carbonfixationthusappearstobemuchmorewidespread thanpreviouslyknown,
and this study lays the foundation to better understand the role of archaea and bacteria in global primary production and how they
contribute to microbial carbon sinks.
Keywords:carbon fixation cycles, reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle, Calvin–Benson–Basshan cycle, 3-
hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
Significance Statement:
Global carbon fixation is underpinned by at least seven different biochemical pathways, of which six are exclusively found in
bacteria and archaea. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture on how these carbon fixation pathways are distributed across
bacterial and archaeal domains of life and discover the unexpected occurrence of certain pathways in specific phylogenetic and
taxonomicgroups.Thesefindingshavesignificantimplicationsastheyshowthatamuchgreaterdiversityofbacteriaandarchaea

Introduction
AutotrophicorganismsarecrucialforsupportinglifeonEarthand
are primary producers in all ecosystems.Both marine and terres-
trial environments contribute equally to the rate of net primary
production,and most of the global CO
2 is thought to be fixed into
organic matter through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle
(1, 2). On land, this process is mainly carried out by eukaryotic
plants,whileintheoceansitismainlydrivenbymicroscopicphy-
toplankton, including microalgae and cyanobacteria (3).
Although carbon fixation pathways (CFPs) other than the CBB
cycle have been known for a long time, only recently has it been
accepted that they also contribute significantly to global net pri-
mary production (4, 5). Besides the CBB cycle, there are six other
known CFPs found in bacteria and archaea: the reverse tricar-
boxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, the 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) bi-cycle,
the 4-hydroxybutyrate/3-hydroxypropionate (4HB/3HP) cycle, the
dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4HB) cycle, the reductive
acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood–Ljungdahl pathway—WLP), and the
reductive glycine pathway (6). Some of these CFPs, such as the
rTCA cycle, are found across several different bacterial and ar-
chaeal phyla,while others are thought to occur only in particular
taxa (e.g. the 3HP bi-cycle in the phylumChloroflexota)( 7,8).
Recent large-scale metagenomic studies have been able to un-
cover the genomic diversityof muchof the bacterial and archaeal
life on our planet (9–11). One of the most comprehensive stud-
ies was recently conducted by Nayfach et al., which describes
52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that cover all
major taxonomic groups (12). These resources now provide the
opportunity to comprehensively describe the distribution of CFPs
in the bacterial and archaeal domains of life.
Here, we use bioinformatics and a hand-curated analysis to
describe the occurrence of CFPs in theArchaea and Bacteria.W e
show evidence for the previously unrecognized occurrence of the
rTCA cycle in certain archaeal and bacterial phyla (Thermoplas-
matota and Elusimicrobiota) as well as an expanded phylogenetic
distribution of the 3HP bi-cycle, the DC/HB cycle, and CBB cycle.

Archaea, was here also detected in theBacteria and found to be
linked to photosynthesis in the genusLuminiphilus.
Results and discussion
In this study, we analyzed the distribution of five CFPs across a
dataset of 52,515 MAGs that belong to the domainsArchaea(5.8%
of MAGs) andBacteria (94.2% of MAGs), and contain 12,556 novel
candidate species (12). CFPs were confidently identified in 1007
MAGs(Fig. 1)and23MAGshavemorethanonepathway[TableS5;
see the “Material and methods”section for details on the identifi-
cationprocessandthetaxonomicclassificationusingtheGenome
Taxonomy Database (GTDB) (13)]. As the WLP, the reverse oxida-
tive TCA cycle, and the glycine reductive pathway can run in the
oxidative direction with the same enzymes (i.e.in methane or ac-
etate oxidizers) and have only reversible enzymatic reactions (14,
15),an accurate in-silico prediction is not possible and hence was
not pursued here.
Energy-generating pathways related to the oxidation of 11
different compounds as well as the biosynthesis of (bacterio-)
chlorophyll were also analyzed to understand how the organisms
generate reductive power for carbon fixation. No correlation was
found between a specific habitat from which the MAGs were re-
covered and the type of CFP we detected in the MAGs (Fig. S1).
Specific observations on each CFP are presented and discussed in
the following sections.
Distribution of the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle
The rTCA cycle, also known as the Arnon–Buchanan cycle, was
firstdescribedinthegreenphotosynthetic,anoxygenicbacterium
Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum [phylum Bacteroidota,f o r m e r l yp h y -
lum Chlorobi (16)] and most of its enzymes catalyze reversible re-
actionsthatarealsousedintheoxidativeTCAcycle.However,the
reductionoffumaratetosuccinateandthecleavageofcitrateinto
acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate reactions are considered to be irre-
versible(15,17).Thecitratecleavagecanbecatalyzedeitherbyan
ATP-dependentcitratelyase(ACL)(hereafterreferredtoasrTCA1,
see Table1) or by the sequential reactions of the ATP-dependent
citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) and the citryl-CoA lyase (CCL) (here-
after referred to as rTCA2,see Table1).CO
2 is fixed in the conver-
sionofsuccinyl-CoAto2-oxoglutarateaswellasintheconversion
of 2-oxoglutarate into isocitrate. Under low product-to-substrate
ratios, the regular citrate lyase can also cleave citrate to support
the rTCA (15); however, this cannot be bioinformatically distin-
guished from the oxidative version of the TCA and was therefore
not considered in the current study.So far,this pathway has been
shown to be restricted to the genusDesulfurella, but it is possible
thatotherorganismsknowntoexpressenzymesoftherTCAcycle
and carrying citrate lyase genes might have the potential to use
this cycle (15).
Consistentwiththeliterature,wefoundgeneticsupportforthe

(Table S1).
Inadditiontothesepreviousobservedtaxa,wefoundherethat
two archaeal MAGs (GEM ID 3300020171_15 and 3300027917_99)
had the rTCA1 cycle with adjusted, observed completeness
greater than 97% and the predicted capacity for hydrogen oxida-
tion (Fig.2).
T hepropositionoftherTC A1c ycleinthedomain Archaeaisnot
novel. Some evidence for the rTCA1 cycle’s carboxylation steps
has been previously found in MAGs also belonging to theThermo-
plasmatotafromahypersalinelakeintheKenyanRiftValley;how-
ever,no solid conclusion could be made due to the predicted ACL
possessing low similarity (32%) to known ACL sequences (26).
In contrast, MAGs 3300020171_15 and 3300027917_99 encoded
both carboxylases required for the rTCA1 cycle as well as both
subunits of the ACL (ACLa and ACLb), which had sequence sim-
ilarities of 47% to 56.6% to reference sequence fromC. limicola.
A predicted membrane-embedded quinol: fumarate reductase as
well as the predicted capacity for hydrogen-based chemolithotro-
phy (Fig.2 and Tables S4 and S6) was also found in both MAGs,
thus together providing the so far strongest support for the pres-
ence of rTCA1 cycle in theThermoplasmatota.
The rTCA1 cycle was also identified in several MAGs belong-
ing to the phylumNitrospirota. Most of the MAGs belong to the
nitrite-oxidizing order Nitrospirales, consistent with previous ob-
servation (17). However, for the first time, the complete set of
enzymes for the rTCA cycle was here identified in organisms
of the orders 2–01-FULL-66–17 (class Nitrospira)a n dt h eTher-
modesulfovibrionales (MAG ID 3300026280_26), which all lacked
the genetic capacity for nitrite-oxidation, but instead appear
to rely on the oxidation of hydrogen, sulfite, and/or sulfide for
energy generation. Similarly, the rTCA cycle in bacterial order
UBA7883 (phylum Nitrospinota) also does not appear to rely on
the oxidation of nitrite, but instead on hydrogen, sulfide, or
sulfite.
WealsofoundgenesfortherTCA1cycleinthe Elusimicrobiota(4
MAGswith >97%pathwaycompleteness),whichisanovelfinding
for this phylum and appears to be coupled to sulfite and hydro-
genoxidation(Fig. 2andTablesS4andS6).Whilemembersofthis
phylum have been reported to be facultative autotrophic,this ca-
pacity has so far only been attributed to the WLP (27).

and exclusively attributed to the phylum Chloroflexota (29, 30).
However, enzymes for this pathway (e.g. 2-methylfumaryl-CoA
isomerase, malonyl-CoA reductase, and propionyl-CoA synthase)
have been recently detected in organisms belonging to the phyla
Actinobacteriota (formerly Actinobacteria)a sw e l la st h ec l a s s e s
Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria within theProteobacteria [recently
renamed “Pseudomonadota (31)], raising speculation about their
abilitytoundertakeautotrophybasedonthe3HPbi-cycle( 32).Our
analysis also detected the key enzymes for this cycle in 27 MAGs
ofthephylum Actinobacteriota,howevertheaveragepathwaycom-
pleteness was only 68.6%, which limits the support for the pres-
ence of the 3HP bi-cycle (Table S1). Instead, we propose that the
detected enzymes are used to assimilate various organic sub-
strates (i.e. glycolate, acetate, propionate, 3-hydroxypropionate,
lactate,butyrate,orsuccinate),similartowhathasbeendescribed
for C.aurantiacus (33) (Supplementary Material and Fig. S2).
As for the Proteobacteria, we discovered MAGs with adjusted
pathway completeness above the required threshold within the
families Ga0077523 and Burkholderiaceae (both class Gammapro-
teobacteria,or derBurkholderiales),both of which have also the pre-
dicted capacity of photosynthesis and oxidation of various inor-
ganic electron donors (Fig.3).

nomic potential do fix carbon through the 3HP bi-cycle and dis-
play a similar organization of the genes related to the glyoxylate
salvage (Supplementary Material).
We also detected all genes required for the 3HP bi-cycle for the
first time in the phylumGemmatimonadota (two MAGs assigned to
the orderGemmatimonadales), whose members are usually found

in plant rhizospheres where they thrive in carbon- and nitrogen-
depleted environments (34, 35). Gemmatimonadota have also re-
cently been found in hadal trenches, where they are considered
to play an important role in organic carbon turnover (36). The ar-
rangement of genes for the glyoxylate salvage pathway were also
similar to those the other MAGs or reference organism. (Supple-
mentary Material and Fig.S3).The predicted capacity for autotro-
phy in theseGemmatimonadales might be linked to the oxidation
of various inorganic electron donors (Fig.3 a n dT a b l e sS 4a n dS 6 ) .
An expanded range of the CBB cycle
The CBB cycle is present in all eukaryotic plants and cyanobac-
teria and widespread in several chemoautotrophic bacteria and
purple phototrophic bacteria (37–39). Consistent with the previ-
ous literature, we detected the genetic potential for the CBB in
members of the phylaActinobacteriota, Cyanobacteriota, Chloroflex-
ota, CPR SAR324 (a former clade within the Deltaproteobacteria),
Gemmatimonadota, Leptospirae, Proteobacteria, Methylomirabilota and
Verrucomicrobiotaandspecificordersandfamilieswithinthem( 40–
44) (Supplementary Material and Table S1).
Despiteitswidespreadandextensivelystudieddistribution,we
found genomic evidence for the CBB cycle in many new taxa and
these includes members of the orderMicrotrichales (phylum Acti-
nobacteriota, classAcidimicrobiia) and Propionibacteriales (phylum
Actinobacteriota, classActinobacteria)( F i g .4) .T h e s eM A G sh a v et h e
genetic potential to perform the sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate
(SBPase) variant of the cycle, where erythrose 4-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate are condensed into sedoheptulose
1,7-biphosphate by an aldolase (45). We also found here first evi-
dence for its presence in members of the familiesBeijerinckiaceae,
Methyloligellaceae,Pseudoxanthobacteraceae,and UBA4765,which all
belong to the orderRhizobiales that has recently been shown to
contain autotrophic organisms (46).
Novel is also the finding of a complete set of CBB genes in
the family Acetobacteraceae (order Acetobacterales, class Alphapro-
teobacteria).It has been previously reported that organisms in this
family encode most of the enzymes required for the CBB, but no
genetic evidence for a phosporibulokinase (PRK) was found (47).
In contrast, we detected in MAG 3300005985_13 of this family a
protein sequence for PRK I with a sequence similarity of 69.4%
to the reference PRK I fromCereibacter sphaeroides. For the first
time, we were also able to identify the genes for a complete CBB
cycle in the orderSneathiellales, which have so far only been de-
scribed as chemoheterotrophic (48). Both MAGs (3300024336_10
and 3300024258_10) identified are unassigned at the family and
genus level, which limits further comparison with the literature,
buttheyhavethepredictedcapacityforchemolithotrophyviathe
oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrite, sulfide, sulfite
and/or thiosulfate.
A full set of genes for the CBB cycle was also found
in two MAGs of the family Marinicellaceae and one MAG as-
signed to the family Rhodanobacteraceae (both order Xanthomon-
adales, classGammaproteobacteria). Xanthomonadales are primarily
chemoorganoheterotrophs,although evidence for chemolithotro-
phy based on sulfur oxidation has been found (49). We were able
to detect genes encoding for the oxidation of carbon monox-
ide, sulfide, sulfite, and/or thiosulfate in theMarinicellaceae MAGs
(3300025702_12 and 3300026519_36), while for theRhodanobacter-
aceae MAG (3300022908_6), no pathways for lithotrophy or photo-
synthesis could be found.

generation. Black squares in the heatmap refers to missing enzymes. The tree was rooted with a MAG from theActinobacteriota, which is not shown
here.
The order GCA-1,735,895 (classGammaproteobacteria) has been
previously inferred to be mixotrophic,but no CFPs were identified
(50).Our findings indicate that its autotrophic growth is based on
the CBB cycle as well as the potential to generate energy through
the oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, manganese, nitrite,
sulfide,sulfite,or thiosulfate (Fig.4 show six representative MAGs
and for the remainder see Tables S1, S4, and S6). Similarly, or-
ganismsassignedtotheorderGCA-2,400,775havebeenpredicted
to be chemolithotrophic, even though no CFP had been proposed
(51). In our analysis, 96 MAGs assigned to this taxon have genes
for the CBB cycle and have the predicted capacity to oxidise am-
monia, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, sulfide, sulfite, or thiosulfate
(Fig. 4 show five representative MAGs and for the remainder see
Tables S1, S4, and S6). We also found all genes for the CBB cycle
in organisms assigned to the familyIMCC2047 (order Pseudomon-
adales), which has genes for the oxidation of sulfide, sulfite, and
thiosulfate.Withintheorder Betaproteobacteriales,wealsodetected
genomicevidencefortheCBBcycleinthefamily Ga0077523(MAG
3300012921_15).This MAGs is predicted to be capable of oxidizing
carbon disulfide, hydrogen, nitrite, sulfide, sulfite, sulfur, or thio-
sulfate, or synthetize bacteriochlorophyll.
Intriguingly, we also found all genes for the CBB cycle with
the exception of sedoheptulose bisphosphatase (SBPase) in MAG
3300017423_22 from the orderBetaproteobacteriales (family Methy-
lophilaceae). However, fructose bisphosphatase has been reported
to be a bifunctional enzyme that can act as SBPase in some
organisms (45, 52). This family is known to be strictly methy-
lotrophic and assimilates methylated compounds through the
ribulose monophosphate cycle (RuMP), which shares its reduc-
tion steps with the CBB cycle ( 53), but does not utilize PRK
and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO)
(45). This MAGs also lacks genes for methanol oxidation, but in-
stead genes encoding for enzyme to oxidize hydrogen, sulfite,
and sulfide. In addition, we detected in this MAG genes encoding
for hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS), hexulose-6-phosphate
isomerase (PHI), methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydro-
genase, and methylene-H4MPT cyclohydrolase, which are part of
the recently described reductive hexulose-phosphate (RHP) path-
way (53). This pathway is different from the CBB in that PHI iso-
merizes fructose 6-phosphate to hexulose 6-phosphate, which is
thencleavedbyHPSintoformaldehydeandribulose5-phosphate.
This pathway has been proposed for an archaeon (53) and our ge-
nomic evidence suggest that it might also be operational in the
bacterial familyMethylophilaceae. This proposition for autotrophy
is also supported by the fact that the majority of the genes for the
RHP pathway are collocated in the same genomic region of MAG
3300017423_22 (Fig. S4).
Growth supported by the CBB cycle has been previously de-
scribed for members of the methanotrophic order Methylococ-
cales, but only for the familyMethylococcaceae (54). We found all
genes for the CBB in three MAGs assigned to the familyMethy-
lomonadaceae of that order. This family was thought to be strictly
heterotrophic (55), but our results rather support the notion
that they can also grow autotrophically, possibly generating en-
ergy from the oxidation of ammonia, carbon monoxide, man-
ganese, sulfide, sulfite, or thiosulfate. Growth using the CBB cy-
cle has also been predicted for members of the family Woe-
seiaceae of the order Steroidobacterales (56). Here, we expand the
phylogenetic breadth of the CBB within this order by discover-
ing also all necessary genes for the CBB cycle in MAGs of the

and 3300000208_9 have the potential to oxidize carbon
monoxide.
Recently, a new form I’ of RuBisCO was described in the
phylum Chloroflexota, which shares a high similarity with Ru-
BisCO form I, but does not depend on the small subunit to be
active (57). Form I’ was found in MAGs belonging to the or-
der Anaerolineales (class Anaerolineae, phylumChloroflexota)a l o n g -
side with several other enzymes of the CBB cycle, such as
PRK,glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase(GAPD),transal-
dolase (TAL), and FBPase, suggesting autotrophic growth. Our re-
sults suggest that this mechanism might also span in theCaldilin-
eales (class Anaerolineae), as one MAGs in that order have genes
for PRK, GDAP, FBPase, and TAL and also only encode for the
large subunit of RuBisCO, which has 78.87% sequence similar-
ity to the form I’ reference sequence (PDB: 6URA_A). Similar re-
sults were found for MAGs in the placeholder ordersCG2-30-64–
16,4572–78,and UBA4142 of theAnaerolineae,suggesting that Ru-
BisCOformI’mightbeasynapomorphyfortheclass,notonlyfor
the order.
The expanded distribution of the
dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle in the
Archaea
The dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/HB) cycle was initially
describedin Ignicoccushospitalis,anhydrogen-oxidizingandsulfur-
reducingarchaeon( 58).TheDC/HBcycle’sconversionofsuccinyl-
CoA to acetyl-CoA uses the same enzymes as the HP/HB cy-
cles, but the regeneration of the former involves the carboxyla-
tionofacetyl-CoAintopyruvatecatalyzedbyanoxygen-sensitive,
ferredoxin-dependent pyruvate synthase. This cycle appeared to
be restricted to anaerobic archaea of the ordersSulfolobales and
Thermoproteales (phylum Thermoproteota, class Thermoproteia)( 59,
60), but our analysis substantially expands its range within the
archaeal domain (Fig.5 and Table S1).
Two MAGs assigned to the classLokiarchaeia(phylum Asgardar-
chaeota) contained all genes for the DC/HB cycle. Member of the
Asgardarchaeotahave been suggested to be capable of growing au-
totrophically, through the WLP or even through reactions medi-
atedbyatypeIII-likeRubisco(Bulzu,Pet.al,2019)( 61,62),butalso,
as we show here,possibly through the DC/HB cycle.Further work
isrequiredtodeterminewhichCFPsareusedbythismetabolically
diverse class and phylum.
And finally,we find,for the first time,genomic evidence for the
DC/HB cycle in the genusSulfolobus (Fig.5), whose members have
been reported to be microaerophilic thermophiles that can oxi-
dise reduced sulfur compounds (Fig.6)( 63). Such growth condi-
tions might allow oxygen-sensitive enzymes of the DC/HB cyle,
such as the ferredoxin-dependent pyruvate synthase, to be ac-
tive (22). To the best of our knowledge,Sulfolobus has so far been
thought to grow autotrophically exclusively through the HP/HB
cycle (60, 21, 64). Our genomic evidence suggests that it can also
grow through the DC/HB cycle, because of the presence of all
the enzymes required for the regeneration of acetyl-CoA from
succinyl-CoA (Fig.5).
The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
cycle in the Archaea and Bacteria
The HP/HB cycle was first discovered in the thermoacidophilic,
iron-oxidizing archaeon Metallosphaera sedula (65) and has been
more recently described in detail for the ammonium-oxidizing
archaeaon Nitrosopumilus maritimus(66, 67). So far, this cycle has

only been reported for theArchaea. The 4-hydroxybutyrate dehy-
dratase (HBD) is commonly considered a key enzyme (65)a si ta p -
pears in theArchaeato be only involved in the HP/HB cycle.In the
Bacteria,however,HBD is part of different metabolic pathways (i.e
succinate fermentation and 4-aminobutanoate degradation) (68).
Asexpected,wefoundampleofgenomicevidenceforthiscycle
in MAGs belonging to the archaeal phylumThermoproteota as well
as the classesNitrososphaeria(orderNitrososphaerales)a n dThermo-
protei (order Sulfolobales) (Table S1). We also found evidence for
this cycle in the genusArchaeoglobus (phylum Halobacteriota,o r -
derArchaeoglobales) (Table S1).However,it has been previously ex-
perimentally shown thatArchaeoglobus lithotrophicus fixes carbon
solely through the WLP,even though predicted homologs for HBD
werefoundinitsgenome( 69).Itisthereforeunclearwhatrolethe
HP/HB cycle enzymes have in this genus.
Novel here is the discovery of the HP/HB cycle in three MAGs
of the family RBG-16–50–20 within the classBathyarchaeia.T h e s e
MAGs have the genomic potential to encode all the enzymes re-
quired for carbon fixation through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-
hydroxybutyrate cycle and this process seems to be supported by
oxidation of hydrogen, sulfide, and/or sulfite.
Unexpectedly,wefoundgenomicevidenceoftheHP/HBcyclein
the Bacteria.Eight MAGs belonging to the genusLuminiphilus(phy-
lum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria,o r d e rPseudomon-
adales,f a m i l yHalieaceae) encoded all the enzymes for this cycle
(Fig.6 and Table S1). We have also detected genes for the synthe-
sis of (bacterio-) chlorophyll in most of these MAGs. Members of
the genusLuminiphilus have previously been described to use or-
ganic carbon sources and have a full photosynthetic apparatus
but lack PRK or RuBisCO genes. They were therefore thought to
be photoheterotrophic organisms (70), however, our observation
shows that they are instead likely capable of autotrophic growth
through the HP/HB cycle, linking this cycle for the first time also
to photosynthesis.
Our observation represents only the second time that the
HP/HB cycle has been proposed to exist in the bacterial domain
of life, with previous work suggesting its presence in the candi-
date phylumSBR1093and in some organisms within theBradyrhi-
zobiaceae of the order Rhizobiales (71). Our results showed that
the MAGs 3300026067_25 (genusPseudolabrys) and 3300027010_2
(genus Methyloceanibacter) within this order have the potential to
fix carbon through this cycle (88% completeness).Further inspec-
tion showed this to be due to missing genes for the malonyl-
CoA reductase and the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase. Dis-
tant homologs, however, may exist for members of both fam-
ilies as manual analysis revealed proteins sharing 30.5% iden-
tity across their full lengths with a predicted malonyl-CoA re-
ductase (UniRef cluster UniRef50_A0A0P8CE70) and 28.5% iden-
tity with a predicted 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase (UniRef
clusterUniRef50_A5UY60)forthe PseudolabrysMAG.For the MAGs
Garritano et al. |9
classified asMethyloceanibacter, we also found protein sequences
sharing 30.1% identity across their entire length with predicted
malonyl-CoA reductase and 28.5% identity with 92.2% coverage
withapredicted3-hydroxypropionyl-CoAsynthetasesequenceof
corresponding UniRef clusters. Altogether, this suggests the po-
tential for the HP/HB cycle in these taxa,which also have the pre-
dicted capacity of sulfur-based chemolithotrophy (Fig.6).
Together, these results show that the HP/HB cycle occurs not
only in the archaeal domain, but also within the Bacteria. Fur-
thermore, the data support the notion that this cycle is not only
restricted to chemolithotrophic organisms, but can also be found
in phototrophs.
Conclusion
OuranalysishasrevealedthatCFPsaremuchmorewidespreadin
the archaeal and bacterial domains of life than previously antic-
ipated. Evolutionarily, this is likely underpinned by complex pat-
ternsofhorizontalgenetransferandgeneloss( 7,43).Futurework
could monitor the CFP expression for these new taxa found here
to better understand their role in global primary production and
define how they contribute to microbial carbon sinks in various
ecosystems.
Material and methods
The nucleotide and predicted protein sequences of 52,515 MAGs
were obtained from the GEM catalogue, available at JGI Genome
Portal with the identifier DOI: 10.1038/s41587-020-0718-6 ( 12).
TheseMAGsweregeneratedfrom3,170metagenomicsamplesob-
tainedfromawiderangeofhabitats(includingfreshwater,marine
water, soil, and thermal springs; see Fig. S1 and Table S1).
For each CFP, we defined key enzymes, which are unique to
the specific pathway, and built hidden Markov models (HMMs)
using the HMMER suite version 3.3 (Table1). For the models, we
only selected sequences that were experimentally proven to cat-
alyze the specific reaction in order to prevent issues related to
“genome annotation rot”(72).When only one experimentally val-
idated sequence was available, we did BLASTP searches to select
enzymes with an identity higher than 90% from different organ-
isms. HMMsearch results are available in Table S3. For the CBB,
we decided to use phosphoribulokinase (PRK) as the key enzyme
for our initial searches instead of RuBisCO as the latter has five
different isoforms, six different clades, and different subunits for
isoforms, which would have complicated HMM building (57). Ac-
cession numbers and seed alignments can be found in Table S2.
An HMM for the mesaconyl-CoA isomerase (TIGR04253) was pre-
viously available (http://tigrfams.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/index.cgi)( 73).
All MAGs with a positive hit (E-value < 10
−99) for the key en-
zymeshadthecompletenessoftheirCFPsanalyzedusingGapSeq
version 1.1 with the UniProt database version UniRef 2021_01
(74). UniRef stores protein sequence clusters at different reso-
lutions that account for sequence similarities within each clus-
ter, which allow to infer homology between proteins. GapSeq
combinessearchesagainstproteinreferencesequencedatabases,
such as UniProt, with pathway and reaction databases (Mod-
elSEED, KEGG, and MetaCyc) in order to infer the presence and
completeness of metabolic pathway in a genome. Carboxylation
reactions were also considered key reactions for all GapSeq anal-
yses. GapSeq parameters were set to use unreviewed protein se-
quences only when reviewed sequences were not available for a
particular reaction or enzyme function, and a bit score higher
than 100 was required (Table S1).
Thresholds for pathway completeness were defined using the
complete genomes of well-studied model organisms for each par-
ticular CFP (Table1).Pathway completeness for the model organ-
ismswasanalyzedbyGapSeq.Theexpectedcompletenessthresh-
olds were set 10% lower than the reference genome values ob-
tained by GapSeq in a conservative measure to avoid false nega-
tives. The observed CFP completeness for the MAGs was then di-
vided by the genome completeness, which was estimated using
the CheckM algorithm (75) with lineage-specific marker genes, to
obtaintheadjusted,observedcompleteness.AparticularCFPwas
considered to be present if a MAG is adjusted,observed CFP com-
pleteness was above the expected completeness threshold.MAGs
with estimated genome completeness lower than 75% were gen-
erally not considered. MAGs 3300013125_33 and 3300017423_22
were the exception as we manually checked them for the form I
RuBisCO.
In most cases, multiple, phylogenetically closely related MAGs
with thesame predictedCFP were foundand thisgave confidence
that the pathway’s presence in a specific taxon or clade is not due
to contaminations. However, in some cases, only one MAG with a
particular CFP was recovered for a specific taxon. In those cases,
genomic regions flanking the CFP genes were checked for poten-
tial mis-assemblies using GC content and taxonomic assignment
of neighbouring genes.
Taxonomy was assigned to MAGs using the GTDB version 95
andGTDB-Tktoolkitversion94( 76).Mappingoftaxonomicnames
in GTDB to those used in the taxonomy of the National Cen-
ter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) can be found athttp:
//gtdb.ecogenomic.org. Unrooted bacterial and archaeal phyloge-
netic trees based on 120 phylogenetic marker genes for bacteria
and 122 marker genes for archaea were generated by GTDB-Tk
and visualized using iTOL (77).
Energy-generating pathways were inferred using GapSeq out-
putsfocusingon34diagnosticpathwaysintheMetaCycdatabase,
which are involved in the oxidation of 11 different inorganic com-
pounds.Inaddition,wedeterminedthepotentialforphotosynthe-
sis through the MetaCyc superpathways for chlorophyll and bac-
teriochlorophyll syntheses. Completeness of the pathways was
determined without considering MAG completeness and values
of >75% are reported for the most complete diagnostic pathways
for each compound. The percentage shown in the dot plot refers
to the most complete oxidation pathway for a specific compound
(e.g. if four different sulfide oxidation pathways were available to
be analyzed, then the percentage in the plot represents the per-
centage of the most complete pathway). A list of the analyzed
pathways and their pathway completeness as well as all genes
found are available in Tables S4 and S6.
