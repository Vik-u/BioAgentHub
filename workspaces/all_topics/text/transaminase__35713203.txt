Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantiose-
lective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates.
This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of
co-substrate. A dual-enzyme recycling system overcomes this
limitation: l-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulat-
ing co-product of (S)-selective transaminases in the kinetic
resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (R)-amines.
However, availability of suitable LAAOs is limited. Here we use
the heterologously produced, highly active fungal hcLAAO4
with broad substrate spectrum. H

as byproduct of hcLAAO4
is detoxified by a catalase. The final system allows using sub-
stoichiometric amounts of 1 mol% of the transaminase co-
substrate as well as the initial application of l-amino acids
instead of α-keto acids. With an optimized protocol, the
synthetic potential of this kinetic resolution cascade was proven
at the preparative scale (> 90 mg) by the synthesis of highly
enantiomerically pure (R)-methylbenzylamine (> 99 %ee) at
complete conversion (50 %).
Introduction
Chiral compounds are frequently utilized as intermediates in
the industrial synthesis of pharmaceutical agents or
agrochemicals.
[1]
Therefore, the production of non-racemic
components in high quality and optical purity is of major
importance. Transaminases have been widely applied for the
enzymatic synthesis of chiral amines
[2–4]
due to important
advantages in large-scale applications: (i) internal cofactor
(pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, PLP) regeneration, (ii) high enantiose-
lectivity, and (iii) a wide range of possible reactions through the
broad spectrum of known transaminases which can be
extended further by enzyme engineering towards broader
substrate acceptance. For example, transaminases have been
successfully used for the production of the herbicide l-
phosphinothricin,
[5]
the anti-hyperglycemic drug sitagliptin
[3,6]
and other building blocks for subsequent synthesis reactions.
[3]
Different main reaction strategies are available for the
transaminase-mediated synthesis of enantiopure amines: (i)
Asymmetric synthesis is based on an enantioselective amination
of prochiral carbon skeletons by transaminases ((S)- or (R)-
selective) leading to a theoretical yield of 100 % of the
produced pure and chiral enantiomer; (ii) Kinetic resolution via
enantioselective deamination by converting one enantiomer
into its corresponding keto product, which leads to a theoretical
yield of 50 % of the remaining amine enantiomer, (iii) Deracem-
ization of racemic amines by coupling two transaminases with
opposite stereoselectivity in a two-step process (conversion of
one enantiomer to the ketone followed by asymmetric syn-
thesis to the desired amine enantiomer in the second step)
leading to a theoretical yield of 100 % of the pure enantiomer.
Moreover, transaminases can be coupled with enantio-comple-
mentary amino acid oxidases (AAO). The AAOs oxidize
selectively the amino acids which will be converted by the
transaminase to the corresponding amines subsequently.
[7]
(iv)
In more complex molecules, an asymmetric transamination can
be coupled with a kinetic resolution, if the ketone contains a
stereo center in α- or β-position. By choosing appropriate
conditions that allow racemization of the ketone enantiomers, a
dynamic kinetic resolution of the remote stereo center can be
achieved while the amino group is installed in an asymmetric
synthesis, resulting in a theoretical product yield of 100 %.
[8]
In
some cases, despite the lower yield, kinetic resolution is the
approach of choice for producing enantiopure products, for
example when the amine as substrate is more easily available
and cheaper than the corresponding ketone (particularly in
case of unnatural amino acids
[9]
) or more stable (e. g. some β-
amines like β-phenylalanine
[10]
). Also, either (S)- or (R)-selective

transaminases are known for some chiral substrates of
pharmaceutical interest, for example Apremilast
[11]
so that only
one enantiomer is accessible by asymmetric synthesis. More-
over, asymmetric synthesis often suffers from various issues like
undesired equilibrium favoring the ketone educt, product
inhibition,
[4,12]
or formation of side products.
[10]
Based on the reaction mechanism of transaminases, full
conversion requires at least stoichiometric amounts of the co-
substrate. This might lead to undesired side effects concerning
the reaction itself and/or the products, complication of the
work-up, inhibition of reaction (e. g. shown for pyruvate
[12]
) or
high costs.
[13]
In this regard, enzyme cascades have moved into
focus for the recycling of the co-substrate (i. e., amino acids) in
transaminase-driven reactions so that catalytic amounts are
sufficient to allow the reaction to take place completely. The
oxidation of the amino acid to the corresponding keto acid can
be performed by amino acid dehydrogenases (AADH),
[14,15]
deaminases (AADs)
[16,17]
or oxidases (AAOs).
[18,19]
Either AADHs, AADs or AAOs selective for d-amino acids
have already been coupled successfully with (R)-selective trans-
aminases in enzymatic cascades for the kinetic resolution of
racemic amino acid mixtures to produce l-amino acids.
[20,21]
To
obtain d-amino acids, (S)-selective transaminases are usually
cascaded with AADs and AADHs acting on l-amino acids.
[16,18]
However, AADs - that act catalytically similar to AAOs - are
membrane-bound proteins which transfer electrons to reduced
cofactor cytochromes while AADHs are dependent on a NADH-
cofactor that needs to be regenerated externally.
[14–16,22]
l-amino
acid oxidases (LAAOs), on the other hand, are soluble cofactor
self-regenerating enzymes that are, therefore, theoretically the
cascade partner of choice. However, until now, their application
was limited by the hurdle of producing a recombinant enzyme
in a good yield and with sufficient activity.
[18,23]
LAAOs isolated
from snake venoms are commercially available and have been
used for cascades with (S)-selective transaminases in a few
examples.
[24,25]
An unspecified LAAO has been used as proof of
concept after the establishment of reaction conditions with
DAAOs in combination with (R)-selective transaminases.
[20]
However, as the substrate spectrum, product inhibition or
activity can vary between the enzymes, the reaction conditions
established with (R)-selective transaminases and DAAOs cannot
necessarily be transferred to the enantio-complementary
enzyme cascade. Recently, a recombinant highly active fungal
LAAO from Hebeloma cylindrosporum (hcLAAO4)
[26,27]
was suc-
cessfully expressed in E. coli as well as Pichia pastoris and
purified in good amounts in our group. hcLAAO4 is able to
oxidize a broad range of proteinogenic l-amino acids to the
corresponding α-keto acids at the expense of molecular
oxygen.
[26,27]
Now the possibility is open for easy and low-cost
in-depth analysis of cascading (S)-selective transaminases with
an autonomous co-substrate regenerating system without
requiring further cofactor recycling.
However, one potential challenge of using AAOs is the
production of H
2
O
2
, which is known to potentially damage
enzymes or induce unwanted side reactions. To address this, we
aim to apply hcLAAO4 in combination with a recombinant
catalase to remove H
2
O
2
efficiently. A catalase has been used
successfully in combination with a DAAO.
[28]
Thus, this work
aims to employ hcLAAO4 as the biocatalyst to recycle the
consumed co-substrate of (S)-selective transaminases (e. g.,
pyruvate) in a kinetic resolution with the addition of catalase
for efficient H
2
O
2
-removal (Scheme 1). Moreover, as the
hcLAAO4 offers a broad substrate spectrum, different co-
substrates worth to be analyzed as well as the establishment of
sufficient enzyme and substrate concentrations to obtain
optimal reaction parameters in cascades combining the LAAO
with (S)-selective transaminases. In particular, an (S)-selective ω-
transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis was used as model enzyme
which is able to accept a broader range of substrates not
limited to amines with carboxylic groups or amino groups in
the α-position.
[29]
Results and Discussion
An enzymatic cascade for co-substrate regeneration
For establishment and initial evaluation of the cascade, we used
the racemic substrate α-methylbenzylamine (rac-α-MBA), and
pyruvate as the co-substrate. In a typical transamination
reaction, both substrates are required in 1 : 1 stoichiometry for
complete enzymatic conversion. This was also verified for the
(S)-selective ω-amino acid : pyruvate transaminase (wildtype)
from Vibrio fluvialis (VFwt) used as the model enzyme in this
study: co-substrate limited reactions only resulted in partial
conversion that correspond to the initial molar percentage
(mol %) of pyruvate used (Figure S1). The l-amino acid oxidase
from Hebeloma cylindrosporum (hcLAAO4) was added to the
reaction to recycle pyruvate so that only catalytic amounts have
to be added initially to the reaction. As the oxidation reaction

cling. The kinetic resolution of racemic α-methylbenzylamine is performed
by an (S)-selective ω-transaminase with pyruvate as a co-substrate, yielding
the reaction products acetophenone and l-alanine by transamination and
the enantiomerically pure (R)-α-methylbenzylamine. Pyruvate is recycled by
the l-amino acid oxidase through oxidation of l-alanine, while the hydrogen
peroxide generated is removed by the catalase.

catalyzed by the amino acid oxidase leads to formation of
hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) as byproduct, recombinantly pro-
duced human catalase (hCAT) was added to remove it.
[30]
We assembled reactions consisting of VFwt, hcLAAO4 and
hCAT and added pyruvate in various sub-stoichiometric concen-
trations from 100 mol% down to 0.1 mol%. When hcLAAO4 and
catalase were added, full conversion was reached with initial
pyruvate concentrations of only 1 mol% (Figure 1 and Figure S1,
D). This was comparable to approaches combining DAAOs and
(R)-selective transaminases and significantly lower than other
(S)-selective transaminase/LAAO reactions before (4-
8 mol%).
[20,25]
However, the low co-substrate concentrations led
to prolonged reaction times (12 times longer if using 1 mol%
compared to 100 mol%) to complete the conversion.
The importance of catalase supplementation was demon-
strated in cascaded reactions in the absence of hCAT: the
reaction did not run to completion and stopped after a short
period which was dependent on the substrate ratio initially
applied. However, the amount of hCAT did not influence the
reaction due to its high activity (Figure S2, A–B).
Reducing the co-substrate concentration below 1 mol% was
not successful, as the production of the deaminated α-MBA
product acetophenone stagnated after 10 hours of reaction
time (Figure S1, D). While addition of either the LAAO or the
transaminase did not yield further conversion at the stagnation
point, addition of fresh co-substrate led to further conversion
within a short time (Figure S3). Moreover, successive addition of
the co-substrate led to prolonged reactions and the stagnation
could be delayed or avoided (Figure 2). This led to the
assumption, that the enzymes are still active, but the co-
substrate was lacking.

is highly reactive with pyruvate and other α-keto
acids
[31,32]
and acetate is being produced from pyruvate by
oxidative decarboxylation within a few minutes under near-
neutral or slightly basic conditions.
[31]
To analyze whether
pyruvate was the only component sensitive to H

, the
enzymes (VFwt and hcLAAO4) and all important substrates
used in this study (MBA, pyruvate, l-alanine, l-norleucine) were

(5 mm, 180 min, 37 ° C),
which was subsequently removed by catalase incubation
(120 min, 37 ° C). Afterwards, each H
2
O
2
-pretreated component
was applied in independent reactions. The results show that
neither the enzymes nor the amine substrates were affected by
incubation with H
2
O
2
. However, the exposure of pyruvate to
H
2
O
2
led to reduced overall activity of the cascaded reaction by
90 % (Figure S4). In conclusion, the stagnation of the cascade
reaction is most likely due to the decarboxylation of pyruvate
by H
2
O
2
despite the presence of catalase. Even though the
catalase has an extremely high specific activity, the catalase
reaction is still diffusion limited.
[33]
Therefore, some of the H
2
O
2
produced might not be neutralized fast enough and still
decomposes pyruvate. While the loss is negligible in the
presence of higher pyruvate concentrations, all pyruvate is
being decarboxylated, if the transamination reaction is per-
formed with very low sub-stoichiometric amounts of pyruvate.
However, the conversion could be pushed towards completion
with higher amounts of LAAO (Figure 3). In contrast, increasing
amounts of transaminase were without effect at low LAAO-
concentrations.
We further excluded that the catalase was inactivated over
time since there was no difference between successive
additions of catalase (every 90 minutes) and a single dosage of
the enzyme when starting the reaction (Figure S2, C). This
clearly shows that the gradual decomposition of pyruvate by

self-decomposition has been described in literature to
occur at high pH or high temperatures.
[34]
However, altered pH-
values and temperatures are known to negatively affect the
enzymatic reactions. Indeed, increasing the pH to 9.0 as well as
increasing the reaction temperature to 50 ° C both resulted in a
decreased conversion, as hcLAAO4 and hCAT display a lower
activity at basic pH,
[26,27,35,36]
and VFwt and hCAT have low
stability at higher temperatures.
[35,37]
Alternatively, H

could
be scavenged by small molecules (e. g. PLP)
[38]
or salts (e. g. Cu,
Mn)
[39]
as additives. In case of DTT and PLP (each 1 mm) no
positive or negative effect was observed whereas CuSO
4
(1 mm)
severely decreased the conversion.
Overall, we were not able to counteract the negative
influence of H
2
O
2
to pyruvate by additives or altering the
reaction conditions so far. However, the adverse impact of H
2
O
2
was only notable at co-substrate concentrations of � 0.5 mol%
which could be counteracted to a certain extent by successive
addition of co-substrate (Figure 2).
For large-scale applications, the cost effectiveness of
enzymatic cascades is of major importance, and the amount of
product in limited volumes should be as high as possible.
Transaminases are known to be inhibited by even low to
moderate concentrations of acetophenone.
[12,40]
Therefore, re-
actions were performed with different initial concentrations of
the substrate (rac-α-MBA) and the maximum conversion was
determined to analyze the maximal possible concentration of
rac-α-MBA that can be applied in the reactions. Product
inhibition was already observed with concentrations above 8–
10 mm (Figure S6). High conversion was observed using 10–
20 mm rac-α-MBA (48 and 45 %, respectively) which yielded up
to 8–10 mm acetophenone. Increasing the substrate concen-
tration resulted in higher acetophenone concentrations (up to
16 mm), but on the other hand only in partial enzymatic
conversion. Therefore, a maximum of 20 mm rac-α-MBA was
applied to further reactions.
As LAAOs are O
2
-dependent,
[18]
sufficient oxygen has to be
supplied to maintain hcLAAO4 reactivity. Therefore, the ratio
between reaction volume and vessel volume was varied in
different reactions with 40 mm rac-α-MBA: Using a larger
volume ratio yielded slightly higher conversion (Table S1).
Another crucial factor was the stability of the enzymes used.
A decrease of soluble protein due to protein denaturation was
observed in different reactions (either visual in larger reactions
or by Bradford quantification) which led to lowered reaction
rate or an aborted reaction. To analyze if the substrate (rac-α-
MBA) or product (acetophenone) showed an impact on protein
stability, incubations were performed with the proteins and rac-
α-MBA or acetophenone at 37 ° C for 6 h (Figure S7). hcLAAO4
was not affected by acetophenone and α-MBA, whereas VFwt
was affected negatively by α-MBA exposure. This could be
explained by amine-induced cofactor- and thus dimer-dissocia-
tion leading to inactive transaminases highlighting the well-
known operational instability of transaminases in amine-rich
solutions.
[29,41]
However, the effect in this study was negligible.
In contrast, hCAT was less stable and precipitated upon
addition of acetophenone (40 %) and α-MBA (38 % precipitated
protein). Remarkably, incubating all proteins together, major
loss of protein could be detected with and without substrates
(65–68 %). The high aggregation potential seemed to be caused
by the instability of catalase in the presence of substrates since
application of the minimal concentration of hCAT (Figure S2)
reduced the protein precipitation to a certain extent (Figure S7)
and the conversion could be increased (Table S1). Conse-
quently, the concentration of the catalase should be kept low
(0.02 mg/mL) which is further beneficial to save costs.
Interestingly, the co-substrate itself was able to affect the
reaction. Instead of pyruvate, l-norleucine was used in cascaded
reactions, which was oxidized by hcLAAO4 to its keto acid
counterpart 2-oxohexanoic acid used by the transaminase. The
concentration of hcLAAO4 required for complete conversion
could be reduced to one-fifth (34 μg/mL, Figure S8) compared
to pyruvate (155 μg/mL, Figure 3). This may be explained by
either the higher affinity of hcLAAO4 towards l-norleucine
compared to l-alanine (Michaelis constant K
M
of 0.32 mm vs.
7.15 mm, respectively, data not shown) or a possibly lower H
2
O
2
reactivity towards 2-oxohexanoic acid compared to pyruvate.
This underlines the necessity to study suitable co-substrates for
the artificial cascade with minimal co-substrate and enzyme
amounts. However, further reduction of the concentration of
hcLAAO4 (Figure S8) or l-norleucine below 1 mol% (data not
shown) also resulted in incomplete conversion, leading to the
suggestion that the prolonged reactions result in loss of this
keto acid as well.
Figure 3. Application of different LAAO concentrations in the recycling
system. The impact of varied hcLAAO4 concentrations on the conversion
rate in the presence of the recycling system was analyzed in VFwt-catalyzed
reactions. The maximum conversion (displayed as bars) was obtained within
9 h. Reactions were carried out in triplicates with 10 mm α-MBA and 0.1 mm
pyruvate (1 mol%).

Taken together, the experiments proved that the LAAO/
catalase recycling system can be utilized in (S)-transaminase-
catalyzed reactions to recycle the co-substrate and thereby
reduce the pyruvate requirement for full substrate conversion
from stoichiometric to catalytic amounts down to 1 mol%
pyruvate. Furthermore, we were able to show the importance
of the enzyme concentrations which was consequently lower
compared to other studies with high and non-optimal concen-
trations (e. g., 1 mg/mL of the LAAO).
[20]
This saves material costs
and further avoids negative effects to the reaction (e. g. by
precipitation).
Transferability of the recycling system
Next, the transferability of the novel recycling system to other
(S)-transaminases was investigated. Beside VFwt, four other well
known (S)-transaminases with various substrate scopes were
studied: VFH3RA, an engineered VFwt transaminase enabling
the efficient conversion of bulkier substrates compared to the
wildtype;
[37]
3HMU, an aminotransferase from Ruegeria
pomeroyi;
[42]
3FCR/4M, an engineered variant with enlarged
acceptance of bulkier substrates compared to the wildtype
transaminase (3FCR) from Ruegeria sp.TM1040,
[42,43]
and CVwt, a
wildtype transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum. Using
α-MBA as model substrate and pyruvate as model co-substrate,
the reactions catalyzed by each transaminase (except 3FCR/4M)
reached near-complete conversion (Table 1, Figure S9) revealing
that the recycling system can be applied as an autonomous
system to different (S)-selective transaminase-catalyzed reac-
tions. Thus, the transferability of the recycling system was
shown for five (S)-selective transaminases using the same amine
substrate in all reactions since either the substrate or product
could have major impact to the proteins (e. g. precipitation or
inhibition). This supports previously published results combin-
ing snake venom LAAOs with specific (S)-selective
transaminases.
[25]
This offers a broad range of possible kinetic
resolution reactions using various transaminases with different
substrate scopes making a large variety of potential products
accessible, like aliphatic, small, bulky, or unnatural amines even
with only catalytic amounts of co-substrate (1 mol%) supplied.
As (S)-selective transaminases are studied over decades, the
enzymes as well as their substrate spectrum is well known, and
many kinetic resolutions of interesting and important racemic
amines have been shown already. Therefore, the focus of this
study was on the co-substrates rather than the amine
substrates, as this is a crucial factor for the two enzymes
(transaminase and LAAO) and hence for the successful and
efficient applicability of the overall cascaded reaction. More-
over, only the co-substrate is converted by the recycling system
(hcLAAO4 and hCAT) motivating our focus on the co-substrates
in the following experiments.
The hcLAAO4 is able to convert many different l-amino
acids selectively to their α-keto acid counterparts.
[26,27]
Con-
sequently, l-amino acids instead of α-keto acids could be
initially applied as co-substrates to the reaction mixture. There-
fore, 9 different l-amino acids, which are known to be
converted by hcLAAO4
[26,27]
were added with rac-α-MBA to
different transamination reactions. With four of them, a high
conversion was achieved, which qualified them as usable co-
substrates (Table 2, Figure S9). Since the hcLAAO4 exhibits a
broad substrate spectrum it becomes possible to adapt the co-
substrate to the properties of the transaminase used in order to
find a suitable co-substrate for each transaminase. The
importance of the co-substrate used in dependence of the
transaminase could be demonstrated in case of the 3FCR/4M
transaminase (highlighted in Figure S9, E). Therefore, the
establishment and choice of an optimal co-substrate for both
enzymes ((S)-selective transaminase and LAAO) gets crucial for
a sufficient kinetic resolution with minimal input of enzymes as
shown in this study. In addition, the use of l-amino acids offers
the advantages that some substrates are more readily available
than their keto acid counterparts and are usually cheaper
(especially in the case of unnatural variants),
[9]
since they are
obtained on a large scale from protein rich organisms

other methods. This is also true for some non-proteinogenic
amino acids, as for example l-norleucine, the preferred amino
acid in this study compared to l-alanine, is much less expensive
( � 200–900 times) than its keto acid counterpart 2-oxohexanoic
acid.
Up-scaled kinetic resolution with the triple enzyme cascade
In order to prove the potential for biotechnological applications
of the soluble triple enzyme cascade in a one-pot approach,
preparative scale reactions were performed. Therefore, an
increased volume of 90 mL (50 mm tris buffer, 0.5 %DMSO,
pH 8.0) was prepared with the enzymes (VFwt (0.12 mg/mL),
hcLAAO4 (0.15 mg/mL) hCAT (0.02 mg/mL) and substrates
(20 mm rac-α-MBA, 0.2 mm pyruvate) in a 500 mL vessel.
Subsequent HPLC-analysis (Figure S10) confirmed complete
conversion (50 %) after 16 hours reaction time at 37 ° C and
130 rpm leading to a product concentration of about 10 mm
corresponding to about 100 mg of (R)-α-MBA.
To further verify the product as successfully enantiopure,
(R)-α-MBA was isolated as a solid TFA salt (94 mg lyophilizate).
The enantiomeric purity of the isolated compound was
analyzed by NMR-spectroscopy (Figure S11) as well as Marfey's
test using FDAA (1-fluoro-2-4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine
amide).
[45]
Commercial (S)-, (R)- and rac-α-MBA served as
reference compounds. It is known that VFwt features an
excellent enantioselectivity and thus, the determined enantio-
meric excess of > 99 %ee further demonstrates that the reactive
enantiomer has been converted completely (Figure 4, Fig-
ure S12).
Conclusions
In this study, the recycling system for (S)-selective trans-
aminase-catalyzed reactions consisting of a recombinant l-
amino acid oxidase (hcLAAO4) and catalase for the oxidation of
the co-product (i. e., l-amino acids) to the co-substrate (i. e., α-
keto acids) was established, thus opening the possibility of
biotechnological applications. Only catalytic (up to 1 mol%)
instead of stoichiometric quantities of co-substrate were
sufficient to complete reactions. The co-substrate amount could
be lowered further compared to previous studies (8 mol%
[20]
and 4 mol%
[25]
). Additionally, the system offers the utilization of
l-amino acids as co-substrates instead of α-keto acids as
cheaper or more practicable co-substrates. In this context, it
became clear that the choice of the co-substrate is crucial for a
complete reaction and also depends on the transaminase used,
as demonstrated for some proteinogenic l-amino acids. The
recycling system could further be transferred to other (S)-
selective transaminase catalyzed reactions while the broad
substrate spectrum accepted by hcLAAO4 allowed to adjust the
co-substrate to the preferences of the applied transaminases. In
contrast to previously published cascades, the concentrations
of the enzymes involved were analyzed and it was found that
enzyme amounts could be reduced and they can affect the
stability of the cascade if they are too highly concentrated.
Furthermore, the preparative scale reaction confirmed excellent
applicability of the system for synthesis and yielded enantio-
merically pure (R)-α-methylbenzylamine (> 99 %ee). This proof
of concept offers the opportunity for further optimization of the
cascade system, i. e., via immobilization of the enzymes.
Experimental Section
General information: Chemicals and solvents were mainly pur-
chased from commercial distributors with analytical grade: Merck
((Darmstadt, Germany), VWR (Hannover, Germany), Carl Roth
(Karlsruhe, Germany) or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA).
DNAse I was used from AppliChem, lysozyme from Fluka Analytical
and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit from Roche. E. coli BL21
(DE3) was purchased from New England Biolabs.
Cloning of human catalase: The gene for human catalase was
purchased from Sino Biological (Plasmid: pCMV3-CAT-His, Catalog
Number HG12084-CH, NCBI NM 001752.3). The catalase sequence
was amplified using the primers NdeI-hCAT1-fwd (GGGGAATTCCA
TATGGCTGACA GCCGGGATCCC) and hCAT1-NotI-rev (TTTTCCTTTT
GCGGCCGCTC ACAGATTTGC CTTCTCCCT), adding a N-terminal NdeI
and C-terminal NotI restriction site. This was followed by a
restriction digest with the corresponding enzymes. As target vector
for the CAT sequence served pSBL14,
[26]
a modified pET28b
containing the hcLAAO4 sequence, an upstream PreScission
protease cleavage site as well as an N-terminal His
6
-tag and the
CTPSR tag. The hcLAAO4 sequence was cut out using NdeI and
NotI, the plasmid backbone gel purified and ligated with the
digested hCAT insert, yielding pFHP-hCAT.
Figure 4. Marfey’s test to confirm enantiomeric purity. To confirm the
enantiomeric excess (%ee) of the deracemized product in the up-scaled
kinetic resolution, α-methylbenzylamine (α-MBA) was extracted, purified and
analyzed by Marfey’s test using FDAA as reagent (A). As control, purchased
enantiopure (R)-α-MBA (B), (S)-α-MBA (C) and racemic α-MBA (D) was
analyzed as well. The signal with a retention time of 8.26 min is the
corresponding FDAA and the spectra were recorded at 340 nm.

Expression and purification of transaminases, human catalase
and hcLAAO4
Expression: For heterologous protein production, E. coli BL21 (DE3)
was transformed with pET24b-VFwt, pET24b-VHH3RA, pET22b-
3HMU, pET22b-3FCR/4 M, pET28b-CVwt or pFHP-CAT. Expression
cultures were inoculated by overnight cultures to an optical density
at 600 nm (OD
600
) of 0.1. Protein expression was induced at an
OD
600
of 0.6-0.7 with 0.1 mm (transaminases) or 0.25 mm (catalase)
Isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and performed for
22 h at 30 ° C (transaminases) or 22 ° C (catalase). Afterwards, cells
were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 7000 × g and 4 ° C,
washed with buffer and stored at   20 ° C. Expression of hcLAAO4
was done in E. coli Arctic Express (DE3), as described in ref. [26].
Purification: The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer
(10 mL/g cell wet weight; 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 15 mm imidazole,
150 mm NaCl, DNAse I, 1 mm AEBSF, 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.5 mm
PLP) and incubated at room temperature for 30 and at 4 ° C for 15
minutes. After disruption by sonication (3 × 10 min; 4 ° C; Branson
Sonifier cell-disruptor B15) the suspension was centrifuged (30 min,
18500 × g, 4 ° C), the supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm filter) and
then applied onto HisTrap
TM
HP columns (Ni
2 +
-NTA affinity
chromatography) using the ÄKTA (GE Healthcare) or NGC (BioRad)
system. Elution was performed by step gradients (10, 15, 70, 100 %)
with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm imidazole,
150 mm NaCl). Both proteins were eluted at 210 mm imidazole in
15 mL and directly dialyzed in several steps using dialysis buffer
(25 mm TRIS, 50 mm NaCl, pH 9.0). If needed, protein solutions
were concentrated via vacuum at 40 ° C (vacuum concentrator RVC
2–18) and stored at   20 ° C. The optimized expression and
purification yielded in about 50–80 mg of transaminases and 40 mg
catalase per liter expression medium (5 g wet weight). For
purification of hcLAAO4, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis
buffer (50 mm NaH
2
PO
4
, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4)
and disrupted by French press. After centrifugation (40 min,
18500 × g, 4 ° C), the filtered (0.22 μm) supernatant was loaded onto
HisTrap
TM
HP columns using the ÄKTA (GE Healthcare) or NGC
(BioRad) system. Unbound components were washed out with
20 mL lysis buffer, followed by a wash step with 13 % and the
elution of hcLAAO4 with 50 % elution buffer (50 mm NaH
2
PO
4
,
300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). According to Bloess
et al.,
[26]
the eluted enzyme was activated by dilution with 4
volumes of citric acid buffer pH 3. After short incubation at acidic
pH, the enzyme was dialyzed against HEPES buffer (100 mm,
150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) for long-term storage. The optimized
expression and purification of hcLAAO4 yielded in about 20 mg
protein per liter expression medium. Purification of enzymes was
continuously monitored at 280 nm (aromatic amino acids) and
additionally at 388 nm (free PLP) and 425 nm (imine between PLP
and enzyme-lysine) in case of transaminases, 405 nm in case of the
catalase (Figure S13) and 450 nm in case of the hcLAAO4.
Chromatograms and SDS-gels are visualized in Figure S14.
Activity assay of transaminases: All activity assays were done in
sealed 1.5 mL reaction vessels to avoid evaporation of acetophe-
none, the product of the activity assays which can be monitored at
245 nm specifically.
[46]
First the enzymes were submitted and
prewarmed to appropriate temperatures (standard: 37 ° C). Addition
of reaction solution (standard: 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mm PLP)
with respective amounts of substrates
1
started the reaction
(standard: 300 μL reaction volume). The production of acetophe-
none was periodically determined by adding 7 μL of each
enzymatic reaction sample to 205 μL water within 96-well UV-
microtiter plates (UV-Star®, Greiner Bio-One), which was always
done in duplicates. The extinction at the start served as blank. The
amount of acetophenone was calculated using an extinction
coefficient of 12 mm
  1
cm
  1
. The stated co-substrates were supplied
in the indicated substrate ratios (mol %; ratio between rac-α-MBA
and co-substrate). The upscaling-approaches were achieved in
sealed 2.0 mL reaction vessels and the kinetic resolution of (R)-α-
MBA in larger reaction vessels with varied reaction volumes
analogous to the above-mentioned procedures. Here, the product
yield was additionally determined by HPLC-measurements.
Determination of protein concentration: The protein concentra-
tion was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum
albumin as standard.
[47]
SDS-PAGE: Protein samples were prepared with SDS buffer (50 mm
Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 12 % glycerol, 4 % SDS, 0.01 % bromophenol blue)
and incubated at 95 ° C for 5 minutes. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 4 % stacking gels and 15 % running gels
were used with bisacrylamide as crosslinker and the electrophoresis
was conducted with 30 mA per gel. After completion, the gels were
washed with water, stained with colloidal Coomassie staining
solution (20 % ethanol, 10 % ammonium sulphate, 3 % orthophos-
phoric acid, 0.1 % Coomassie G-250) and destained with water.
HPLC measurements: The quantification of α-MBA and acetophe-
none was performed by HPLC-measurements. Therefore, samples of
reaction mixtures were taken, acidified to pH 2.0 with HCl and
incubated at 95 ° C for 5 minutes to denature proteins. The solutions
were centrifuged twice, and the supernatants were diluted with
HPLC buffer containing 0.2 % TFA to obtain 0.5-1.0 mm solutions.
Solutions were transferred to glass vials with screw caps to avoid
evaporation of the products (see Figure S15) and analyzed via
analytical HPLC on a Shimadzu NexeraXR 20 A system with an
autosampler, degasser, column oven, diode array detector and a
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (2.9 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm) with a
gradient (in 5.5 min from 5 % to 95 % B, 0.5 min 95 % B and back in
0.1 min to 5 % B with a total runtime of 9 min) of eluent A (0.1 %
TFA in water) and eluent B (0.1 % TFA in acetonitrile) 10 μL were
injected with a flowrate of 650 μL/min (column oven temperature
40 ° C) and the runs were monitored at 245 nm (acetophenone) or
254 nm (α-MBA). Quantification of products were done using
propiophenone as internal standard and standard curves of
acetophenone and α-MBA.
Extraction of α-MBA: For the extraction of α-MBA from enzymatic
reaction mixtures, the solution was initially acidified with HCl to
pH 2.0. After the addition of dichloromethane (DCM) in a 1 : 1
volume ratio, the solution was briefly incubated and then
centrifuged to separate the phases. The organic phase was with-
drawn (without protein precipitates within the interphase) while
the aqueous phase was further washed twice with DCM in a 1 : 1.5
volume ratio and afterwards basified with NaOH to pH 12.0. n-
Hexane was used for the extraction of α-MBA and supplied in a
1 : 2.5 volume ratio. After brief incubation the solution was
centrifuged whereupon the aqueous phase was further washed
twice with n-hexane (1 : 2.5 volume ratio). The organic fractions
were pooled, dried with anhydrous MgSO
4
, filtered (0.22 μm filter)
and finally the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
(335 mbar). The yellow and oily product was resuspended in n-
hexane and distributed in glass-vials (screw caps) whereafter n-
hexane was evaporated under an argon stream and dried in
vacuum.
Marfey’s test: The enantiopurities of the purchased and synthesized
compounds were determined using the chiral agent 1-fluoro-2-4-
dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide (FDAA). Therefore, a solution of
FDAA (100 μL, 15 mM, 1.5 eq.) in acetonitrile was added to a 1 : 2
water/acetonitrile solution (300 μL) containing the corresponding
1
Racemic α-methylbenzylamine (rac-α-MBA) was used as main substrate in
varied concentrations (standard: 10 mm).

α-MBA (3.33 mM, 1 eq.) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (0.1 M,
30 eq.). The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 40 ° C, neutralized
with aq. HCl (50 μL, 0.2 M) and diluted with 1 : 1 water/acetonitrile
(450 μL). The resulting solution was analyzed using LC-MS.
LC-MS: The analysis was performed with an Agilent 6220 TOF-MS
with a Dual ESI-source, 1200 HPLC system (Agilent) with autosam-
pler, degasser, binary pump, column oven, diode array detector
and a Hypersil Gold C18 column (1.9 μm, 50 × 2.1 mm). The gradient
started with 100 % eluent A (water/ACN/formic acid, 94.9 : 5 : 0.1),
during 12.5 min the percentage of eluent B (ACN/water/formic acid,
94.9 : 5:0.1) increases from 0 % to 98 % B and returned to 0 % B in
0.5 min. Total run time was 18.5 min at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min
and column oven temperature of 40 ° C. After separation via the
1200 HPLC system ESI mass spectra were recorded in extended
dynamic range mode equipped with a Dual-ESI source, operating
with a spray voltage of 2.5 kV. The same system was used for high
resolution mass spectroscopy.
