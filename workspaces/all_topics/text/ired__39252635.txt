Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for
the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric
imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations
of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the
reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and
dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed
by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED-
catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbon-
yls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted
acyclic and cyclic N-alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and
scaling up a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we
demonstrated the scalability and atom-efficiency of an H
2
-
driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the poten-
tial of IREDs in biocatalysis.
Reductive aminations are among the most convenient and
straightforward reactions for amine synthesis – essential
building blocks for the development of agrochemicals and
pharmaceutical agents.
[1]
In the recent years, NADPH-dependent
imine reductases (IREDs) have emerged as efficient catalysts for
reductive aminations, enabling the use of a range of amines –
spanning from primary and secondary alkyl amines, aryl amines,
hydroxyl amines, diamines, piperidines to pyrrolidines.
[2–8]
Hydrazines are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural
and rocket fuel industries and are building blocks for N-
heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazoles, pyrazines and
indoles.
[9,10]
The presence of hydrazine as an intermediate in
nitrogenases illuminates the diverse roles of hydrazine com-
pounds in biological systems.
[11]
To date, however, there have
been limited biocatalytic methods reported in the literature
that could implement reductive aminations using hydrazines as
reactants, so-called reductive hydrazinations.
[12]
This is intrigu-
ing, given the numerous biologically active hydrazine products
found in nature with anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidative
or anti-cancerogenic properties.
[13–15]
Most of these alkaloids are
derived from simple hydrazine precursors like phenylhydrazine,
4-hydroxymethyl phenylhydrazine, N-aminoalanine, or piperazic
acid.
[12,13]
Interestingly, there are biological studies indicating
the occurrence of methylhydrazine in the fungus Gyromitra
esculenta and N,N-dimethylhydrazine in tobacco, which could
act as a substrate for the formation of more complex
hydrazines, hydrazidines or hydrazones.
[16,17]
Based on our recent results, earlier experiences, and in
continuation of our research activities, we anticipated the use
of IREDs could enable an efficient reductive hydrazination
process. Mirroring the requirements for reductive amination
(Scheme 1A), a method for reductive hydrazination should
facilitate the condensation of a carbonyl with one of the vicinal
amino groups of hydrazine to generate a hydrazone.
[18,19]
This
intermediate must then be selectively reduced over the
carbonyl starting material. In addition to reductive hydrazina-
tions, we envisioned that hexahydropyridazines, 1,2 diazepanes,
N-aminopyrrolidines and N-aminopiperidines could be obtained
by utilizing dicarbonyls with hydrazines in double reductive
hydrazination reactions (Scheme 1B).

The research in our laboratories has thus focused on
reductive hydrazinations using IREDs for the facile preparation
of hydrazines in one-pot under mild conditions.
We used an engineered NADH-dependent IRED variant and
found that it was effective in the application of our method. We
thus also address the scalability of this biocatalytic process,
acknowledging the challenges posed by the stoichiometric
supply for nicotinamide cofactors during upscaling. Building on
atom-efficient integration of the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase
(SH) from Cupriavidus necator with IREDs for H
2
-driven reductive
amination, we extended this approach to double reductive
hydrazination.
[20–22]
In an earlier study, we have reported on a promising
method for producing piperazines and azepanes enzymatically
through double reductive aminations. To conduct these reac-
tions, we utilized the R-selective IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus
(R-IRED_Ms).
[23]
We further engineered the cofactor specificity of
R-IRED_Ms from NADPH to NADH yielding in variant R-IRED_Ms-
V8. After demonstrating that variant V8 shows similar catalytic
performance compared to the wild-type enzyme (data not
shown), we decided to use this variant for probing the reaction
of various aldehydes and ketones in the presence of hydrazines
in a spectrophotometric NADH-depletion assay. We employed
seven different hydrazines (a–g) and 29 aldehydes and ketones
(1–29) to inspect the substrate scope and limitations of the
enzymatic reductive hydrazination. The results are detailed in
Tables 1 and 2.
We found that R-IRED_Ms-V8 is an effective catalyst as most
enzymatic reactions provide the desired hydrazine products.
The reductive hydrazination rate of aldehydes and ketones to
hydrazines on the catalyst are expressed as turnover frequen-
cies (TOF) as a measure of activity obtained via the spectropho-
tometric assay. The TOF indicates how many times the catalytic
cycle occurs (turns) on a single site per unit time and is typically
defined as the number of reaction products generated per
active site per unit time. We chose to describe the enzyme
activity using TOF, when a spectrophotometric assay was
possible, to provide a clear indication of the activity at the
single catalyst active site level. We confirmed the formation of
these products through biotransformations. Due to the absence
of hydrazine standards, the formed products were identified
using GC-MS (SI Chapter 4). We observed that R-IRED_Ms-V8
accepted various carbonyl substrates, and in the absence of
IRED catalyst, no product formation was observed and starting
materials remained unaffected or reacted to the hydrazone
intermediate without further reduction reactions. In general,
higher activities were observed for aliphatic aldehydes 1–9
(Table 1, entries 1–6) compared to (non-cyclic) aliphatic ketones
13–22 (Table 1, entry 7). Thereby, the best accepted non-cyclic
carbonyls were the aliphatic C4-substrates n-butanal (3, Table 1,
entries 2–4, best aldehyde) and 2-butanone (14, Table 1, entry 7,
best non-cyclic ketone). Moreover, cyclohexanone (28, Table 2,
entries 3–7) was found to afford the highest turnover frequency
in the reductive hydrazination.
More bulky hydrazines and hydrazines protected with a
BOC group were also compatible with phenylacetone (24, SI
Table S2, entries 11–13) and 28. The comparison of the
hydrazine substrates tested with carbonyl substrates 3 a–3 g
(Table 1, entries 3–4), 24 a–24 g (SI Table S2, entries 11–13) and
28 a–28 g (Table 2, entries 3–7), revealed that methylhydrazine
(b) is best accepted by IRED. Hydrazine esters were also tested,
such as ethyl hydrazinoacetate (h), but no activity has been
detected.
Moreover, for some carbonyl and hydrazine combinations
no activity could be detected in the spectrophotometric assay.
Some hydrazone intermediates 11 a, 11 b, 12 b, 24 d caused the
formation of a turbid solution or misleading signals in the
NADH-depletion assay (3 g, 24 g, 28 g). Despite these results, we
were able to confirm the product formation by GC-MS for most
of these substrate combinations (SI Chapter 4).
It is noteworthy that some of the hydrazine products
formed can act as nucleophiles for subsequent reductive
hydrazinations with carbonyl substrates (Scheme S1). However,
these secondary products were detected only in traces and can
be neglected for most reactions. The exception to this is the
transformation of 3 or 28 with hydrazine (a). In this substrate
combination, secondary reactions were significantly increased,
but we were able to circumvent this issue by increasing the
hydrazine concentration and shortening the reaction time

(Figure S1). Next, we continued to examine the reaction scope
with various dicarbonyls to enable double reductive hydrazina-
tion for the formation of cyclic hydrazines. For this reaction, two
consecutive IRED-catalyzed steps along with the consumption
of two nicotinamide molecules are necessary to produce
saturated N-heterocycles (Scheme S2).
In principle, there are two approaches how the double
reductive hydrazination of dicarbonyls can proceed, depending
on the substitution pattern of the hydrazine substrate – either
both (subtype 1) or one vicinal amino group is incorporated
into cyclic pyrazolidine or hexahydropyridazine products (sub-
type 2). For some hydrazine substrates, both subtypes are
possible. In total, nine different saturated heterocycles were
formed applying the double reductive hydrazination. The
results are summarized in Table 3.
Results obtained from GC-MS showed that in some cases,
there was an accumulation of the cyclic hydrazone intermedi-
ate, formed after the first IRED-catalyzed reduction step. Based
on these results, we can conclude that for certain substrate
combinations, the second reduction step by the IRED is the rate
limiting step. As a result, it is not possible to determine the
overall activity of the total reaction using the NADH-depletion
assay. We thus characterized the enzymatic activity measuring
endpoint yields via GC-MS and GC-FID.
Since there were no product standards available, we used
diacetylated hexahydropyridazine 34 g (Table 3, entry 13) for
calibration curves and calculations of product formations
(Table 3). No product formation was observed with diketones
30 and 31 (Table 3, entries 1–2), as they rapidly reacted with
hydrazines to form a pyrazole side product, as described in
literature.
[24]
Interestingly, the highest product formation of
94 % was observed with glutaraldehyde (34, Table 3, entries 9–
13) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (c), which only allows the
reaction via subtype 2. Moderate product formations of up to
14 % were detected for substrates 32 and 33 (Table 3, entries 3–

13). Remarkably, despite its high toxicity to proteins, 34 was
found to be a suitable dicarbonyl for the double reductive
hydrazination. Incubation of 34 with the hydrazine substrate for
30 min before adding IRED resulted in a reduced concentration
of toxic 34 due to the formation of the less toxic hydrazone
intermediate, which is then converted into the product in
followed enzymatic reductions. Overall, our studies have shown
that hydrazines are accepted nucleophiles for the enzymatic
reductive hydrazination and can be used to form acyclic
hydrazine products as well as hydrazine-containing N-hetero-
cycles with different substitution patterns. Turnover frequencies

) were reached for the reductive
hydrazination of carbonyls. The highest product formation
(94 %) was observed for the double reductive hydrazination of
34 with c to generate N,N-dimethylpiperidin-1-amine (34 c,
Table 3, entry 11). Notably, although chiral centers are formed
during the double reductive hydrazination, the lack of chiral
standards prevented us from fully discriminating the enantio-
meric excess in the products.
While the initial biocatalytic system utilized GDH for
cofactor regeneration, we aimed to improve the efficiency by
integrating the SH with R-IRED_Ms-V8, thereby establishing an
H
2
-driven double reductive hydrazination process. We chose
compound 34 c as a proof-of-concept, which we prepared by
converting glutaraldehyde (34) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (c)
using the IRED. In this setup, we increased the reaction volumes
to mimic a technical scale and adjusted the cofactor concen-
tration, to maximize efficiency. We also extended the reaction
time to eight hours to account for changes in reaction kinetics
due to lower component concentrations. These changes were
crucial in maintaining high conversion rates without sacrificing
efficiency. We were able to achieve a 92 % conversion rate
under these conditions, as evidenced by the results in Table 4.
To accurately describe the stereoselectivity of biocatalytic
reductive hydrazination, the development and use of chiral
standard materials, higher catalytic activities for product
isolation, and advanced chiral analytical methods are required.
The catalyst R-IRED_Ms-V8, noted for its effectiveness in the
asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, is anticipated to exhibit
similar selectivity in reductive hydrazination. Preliminary chiral
chromatographic data supports this hypothesis, showing
enantiomeric excess (ee) greater than 75 % for highly active
catalyst-substrate combinations (data not shown).
In summary we have successfully developed an enzymatic
approach for the synthesis of hydrazine derivatives through
IRED-catalyzed reductive hydrazinations of (di)carbonyls. To
achieve this, we used our previously engineered NADH-depend-
ent IRED variant (R-IRED_Ms-V8). With this engineered catalyst,
we were able to form non-cyclic hydrazines and prepare novel
N-heterocycles, resulting in the production of pyrazolidine,
hexahydropyridazine, pyrrolidine-1-amine or piperidine-1-amine
products. We addressed the challenges of cofactor regeneration
by integrating the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Cupriavidus
necator, enhancing atom efficiency and sustainability for large-
scale applications. By developing an H
2
-driven double reductive
hydrazination biocatalytic process, we have not only provided a
mild and straightforward method for developing novel N-
heterocyclic compounds but also set a new benchmark for
sustainable green synthesis of hydrazine derivatives. Further
studies on the synthetic applications and improvement of IRED
catalysts are ongoing in our group.
