Abstract 
Background: Light-driven consortia, which consist of sucrose-secreting cyanobacteria and heterotrophic species, 
have attracted considerable attention due to their capability for the sustainable production of valuable chemicals 
directly from  CO2. In a previous study, we achieved a one-step conversion of sucrose secreted from cyanobacteria to 
fine chemicals by constructing an artificial coculture system consisting of sucrose-secreting Synechococcus elongateus 
cscB+ and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) producing Escherichia coli ABKm. Analyses of the coculture system showed 
that the cyanobacterial cells grew better than their corresponding axenic cultures. To explore the underlying mecha-
nism and to identify the metabolic nodes with the potential to further improve the coculture system, we conducted 
integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses.
Results: We first explored how the relieved oxidative stress affected cyanobacterial cell growth in a coculture system 
by supplementing additional ascorbic acid to CoBG-11 medium. We found that the cell growth of cyanobacteria was 
clearly improved with an additional 1 mM ascorbic acid under axenic culture; however, its growth was still slower 
than that in the coculture system, suggesting that the improved growth of Synechococcus cscB+ may be caused by 
multiple factors, including reduced oxidative stress. To further explore the cellular responses of cyanobacteria in the 
system, quantitative transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics were applied to Synechococcus cscB+. Analyses of 
differentially regulated genes/proteins and the abundance change of metabolites in the photosystems revealed that 
the photosynthesis of the cocultured Synechococcus cscB+ was enhanced. The decreased expression of the  CO2 trans-
porter suggested that the heterotrophic partner in the system might supplement additional  CO2 to support the cell 
growth of Synechococcus cscB+. In addition, the differentially regulated genes and proteins involved in the nitrogen 
and phosphate assimilation pathways suggested that the supply of phosphate and nitrogen in the Co-BG11 medium 
might be insufficient.
Conclusion: An artificial coculture system capable of converting  CO2 to fine chemicals was established and then 
analysed by integrated omics analysis, which demonstrated that in the coculture system, the relieved oxidative stress 
and increased  CO2 availability improved the cell growth of cyanobacteria. In addition, the results also showed that the

Introduction
Cyanobacteria with the capability of producing organic 
matter from  CO2 using solar energy have attracted 
increased attention as environmentally friendly and sus -
tainable “microbial cell factories” for the production of 
carbohydrate feedstocks to support traditional fermen -
tation processes [1, 2]. For example, sucrose is an easily 
fermentable feedstock. Several cyanobacterial species 
are capable of synthesizing and secreting sucrose as 
an osmolyte under appropriate environmental stimuli, 
such as osmotic pressure [3], and this process can be 
sustained over a long period of time and at higher lev -
els than that from plant feedstocks such as sugarcane 
and beet [4, 5]. However, purification of sucrose from 
cyanobacterial cultivation supernatant is costly, and the 
system is easily contaminated, which creates barriers to 
any scale-up cultivation [6]. In addition, any application 
of photosynthetic cell factories in scale-up facilities is 
always restricted by challenges from harsh environments, 
suggesting that the adaptability and compatibility of 
cyanobacterial cell factories should be further improved 
to facilitate industrial-scale biomanufacturing [7]. In 
recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the 
exchange of essential metabolites between microorgan -
isms could be a crucial process that can significantly 
affect the growth, composition and structural stability of 
microbial communities in nature [8, 9]. For instance, in 
aquatic environments, the ecological interaction between 
photoautotrophic and heterotrophic species is based on 
cross-feeding and metabolite exchange [10]. To date, 
multiprotein complexes that cross cell membrane(s) and 
extracellular vesicles have been evaluated in photoau -
totrophs for transporting materials from the interior to 
the exterior of the cell [11], which facilitate the secretion 
of various chemicals ranging from targeted photosyn -
thetic intermediates, such as glycolate, osmolytes and 
fatty acids, and extracellular polymeric substances, to the 
products of cell lysis, including sugars, proteins, lipids 
and nucleic acids [12, 13]. These organic compounds 
could support the cell growth of the heterotrophic spe -
cies. In addition, heterotrophic species are also thought 
to provide essential micronutrients, such as vitamins 
and amino acids, which are beneficial to maintain high 
photosynthetic productivity [9]. In addition, some posi -
tive effects on promoting cell growth were also observed, 
which may be attributed to the decreased oxidative stress 
by heterotrophs through reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
scavenging [14, 15]. Inspired by the symbiotic system 
commonly found in nature, increasing efforts have been 
made in recent years to design artificial routes of metabo-
lite interchange to construct new symbiotic systems with 
high efficiency and stability [16, 17].
Light-driven artificial consortia consisting of sucrose-
secreting cyanobacteria and heterotrophic species 
have recently attracted significant attention due to the 
potential to be alternatives for the utilization of sucrose 
secreted from cyanobacteria [18]. For example, Ducat 
et  al. constructed a coculture system consisting of the 
cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 
(hereafter Synechococcus 7942) and the heterotrophic 
bacterium Halomonas boliviensis, in which the growth of 
H. boliviensis was supported by sucrose produced by S. 
elongatus 7942 [19]. In another study, Li et  al. designed 
a coculture system with sucrose-secreting S. elongatus 
7942 and three different yeasts to mimic lichen and to 
study the interaction between autotrophic and hetero -
trophic strains [14]. More recently, Liu et al. constructed 
a coculture system composed of S. elongatus 7942 and 
E. coli to produce isoprene. The obtained results showed 
that the fermentation time of the coculture system was 
extended from 100 to 400 h by adjusting the inoculation 
ratio between S. elongatus 7942 and E. coli. Moreover, 
in this system, the production of isoprene was increased 
sevenfold to 0.4  g/L compared to the axenic culture of 
E. coli [20]. Zhang et  al. constructed a microbial con -
sortium consisting of the fast-growing cyanobacterium 
Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 (hereafter Synecho -
coccus 2973), which is capable of growing under high 
light and temperature conditions [21], as well as E. coli, 
to sequentially produce sucrose and then the platform 
chemical 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) from  CO2 
[22]. All abovementioned studies suggested that a light-
driven coculture system could be a promising strategy for 
future  CO2-based biomanufacturing and could also be 
an attractive approach for converting sucrose into value-
added chemicals.
supply of phosphate and nitrogen in the Co-BG11 medium might be insufficient, which paves a new path towards 
the optimization of the coculture system in the future. Taken together, these results from the multiple omics analyses 
provide strong evidence that beneficial interactions can be achieved from cross-feeding and competition between 
phototrophs and prokaryotic heterotrophs and new guidelines for engineering more intelligent artificial consortia in 
the future.

To construct light-driven coculture systems with high 
efficiency, it is necessary to fully understand the meta -
bolic mechanism underlying the interaction between 
autotrophs and heterotrophs. Although several previ -
ous studies have shown that cyanobacterial cell growth 
could be improved in coculture systems [14], the mecha -
nism has yet to be determined. Moreover, while it is fully 
expected that the mechanism involves more than just a 
single gene or even a single metabolic node, to date, only 
few studies have utilized global-based omics techniques 
to explore the interaction mechanism [23–25]. Due to 
the complexity of the coculture structure, the challenge 
of studying the interaction mechanism is also increased. 
Integrated omics analysis could be a good approach to 
obtain a “panorama” of cells in coculture systems and 
reveal novel insights into the biological mechanism 26. 
For example, Amin et  al. analysed the signalling and 
interaction between diatoms and associated bacteria 
through integrated metabolite and transcriptomic analy -
sis, in which tryptophan and indole-3-acetic acid were 
determined to be the key signalling molecules involved 
in the complex exchange of nutrients [27], demonstrat -
ing that the approach of integrated transcriptomics, pro -
teomics and metabolomics should be adopted to explore 
microbial interactions in coculture systems.
In our previous study, Zhang et  al. [22] constructed 
an artificial coculture system that was able to produce 
~ 68.29 mg/L 3-HP in 7 days. However, how to improve 
its productivity and stability remains challenging. In 
this study, an integrated proteomics, transcriptomics 
and metabolomics approach was employed to analyse 
the metabolic responses of cyanobacteria to the het -
erotrophic partner in the artificial coculture system, 
which will be valuable for understanding the underlying 
mechanisms of improving the cell growth of cyanobac -
teria. Additionally, multiple omics analyses also revealed 
the potential metabolic nodes that have the potential 
to improve the efficiency and stability of the coculture 
system.
Materials and methods
Strains and culture conditions
The sucrose-secreting strain Synechococcus cscB + 
(derived from Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973) and 
the sucrose-utilizing and 3-HP-producing E. coli ABKm 
strain reported in our previous study were used to con -
struct a coculture system [22]. Synechococcus cscB + was 
cultivated under 100  μmol photons  m−2  s−1 in an illu -
minating shaking incubator (HNYC-202  T, Honour, 
Tianjin, China) at 130 rpm and 37 °C or on BG-11 agar 
plates in an incubator (SPX- 250B-G, Boxun, Shang -
hai, China) [28]. The E. coli ABKm strain was grown on 
LB medium or agar plates with appropriate antibiotics 
added to maintain plasmids at 37  °C in a shaking incu -
bator (HNY-100B, Honour, Tianjin, China) at 200 rpm or 
in an incubator, respectively. Coculture medium (hereaf -
ter CoBG-11) was used to construct a coculture system 
according to a previous study [22], in which 150  mM 
NaCl, 4  mM  NH4Cl and 3  g/L 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-
2-(hydroxymethyl) propan-2-yl] amino] ethanesulfonic 
acid (TES) were supplemented into the BG-11 medium. 
The pH value was adjusted with NaOH to 8.3.
For construction of the coculture system, exponential-
phase Synechococcus cscB +  (OD750≈1.0) was collected 
and inoculated into 25  mL of CoBG-11 and grown at 
30 °C for 48 h to an  OD750 of 0.5. E. coli was cultivated 
in CoBG-11 with 1  g/L sucrose for 48  h, and then the 
cells were collected and resuspended in deionized water 
and inoculated into the 25 mL Synechococcus cscB + cul-
ture grown on CoBG-11. To separate the two species in 
the coculture system, a dialysis bag (diameter is 36 mm, 
molecular weight cut-off is 14  kDa, biosharp, Hefei, 
China) was used. The E. coli ABKm was incubated in the 
dialysis bag, while Synechococcus cscB + was incubated 
outside in the flask (Additional file  2: Figure S1). The 
pre-treatment of dialysis bags was performed according 
to a previous study with some modifications [29]. Briefly, 
the dialysis bag was cut into small pieces of appropri -
ate length (approximately 10 cm), which were boiled for 
10 min with a large volume of 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0). 
Then, the dialysis bags were boiled twice with distilled 
water for 10  min each. The prepared dialysis bag was 
autoclave-sterilized before use.
The cell density was measured at  OD750 using a 
UV-1750 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). 
The co-cultivated Synechococcus cscB + was counted by a 
haemocytometer under a microscope (BX43, Olympus, 
Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) after serial dilution.
Determination of  H2O2 and ROS concentrations
H2O2 Quantitative Assay Kit (Water-Compatible) (San -
gon Biotech, Shanghai, China) was used to analyse the 
content of  H2O2 in the medium supernatant. Under 
acidic conditions,  H2O2 oxidizes  Fe2+ ions into  Fe3+ 
ions, which then combine with dye molecules to form 
an  Fe3+-dye complex. The formed complex has a maxi -
mum absorption wavelength of 560 nm (or 595 nm), and 
the absorption value is proportional to the concentration 
of  H2O2, which was detected by a spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Vantaa, Finland).
For ROS measurement, cell samples (1 OD750 unit) 
were harvested and resuspended with BG11. ROS con -
tent was measured using a Reactive Oxygen Species 
Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the 1 nonfluorescent 
probe DCFH-DA was finally oxidized by intracellular 
Page 4 of 15Ma et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2022) 15:69 
ROS or other peroxide fluorescent DCF. The DCF was 
detected using an F-2700 fluorescence spectrophotom -
eter (Hitachi, Japan) at EX 488 nm and EM 525 nm.
Transcriptomic analysis of cyanobacterial responses to E. 
coli in the coculture system
Considering the characteristics of transcriptomics tech -
nology and the accuracy of transcriptomics data, dialy -
sis bags were used to separate cyanobacteria and E. coli 
to construct the coculture system. For transcriptomic 
analysis, 5  OD750 of cocultured and ascorbic acid-treated 
axenic Synechococcus cscB+ were collected for extracting 
RNA samples; meanwhile, the same amount of Synechoc -
occus cscB+ cultivated under axenic conditions was used 
as a control. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted by 
GENEWIZ (Suzhou, China). There were three biological 
replicates for each sample, and two statistical parameters, 
fold change > 1.5 and Q-value (fdr or padj) ≤ 0.05, were 
used to determine differentially regulated genes.
Quantitative proteomics analysis of cyanobacterial 
responses to E. coli in a coculture system
The same weight of 4-day cocultured strains was sampled 
for proteome analysis. The samples were enzymatically 
digested by trypsin, followed by isobaric tags for relative 
and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). The samples were 
analysed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec -
trometry (LC–MS/MS). Axenic Synechococcus 2973 cells 
with the same incubation time were used as a control. 
The technical service and quantitative proteomics data 
were provided by BGI (Shenzhen, China). Three biologi -
cal replicates for each sample were used. In the case of 
unmatched biological replicates, two statistical param -
eters, fold change > 1.2 (the average ratio of the nine 
comparison groups) and P-value < 0.05 (t-test of nine 
comparison groups), were used to screen differentially 
regulated proteins.
Correlation analyses between transcriptome and proteome
For correlation analyses, the genes with a 1.5-fold dif -
ference in transcriptome data and the proteins with a 
fold change value of 1.2 in the proteome were extracted, 
respectively, and then the corresponding difference 
multiple and significance information (P-value) were 
obtained. The data were imported into Linux to construct 
the database, and the differential protein data were used 
as query sequences for BLAST comparison. The results 
with a 90% greater comparison ratio were extracted from 
the obtained comparison results, and the corresponding 
information of genes and proteins was extracted.
Quantitative real‑time PCR analysis
For RNA extraction, the 2  OD750 cells of Synechococcus 
cscB+ under axenic culture and coculture were collected 
and centrifuged at 7830 rpm and 4 ℃ for 5 min. Total RNA 
samples were extracted using a Direct-zol™ RNA Miniprep 
kit (Zym Research, CA, USA) according to the manufac -
turer’s instructions and then reverse transcribed as cDNA 
templates using  HiScript® II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR 
(+ gDNA wiper) reagent (Vazyme, China). The quantitative 
real-time PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed according 
to the previously described methods [30]. Briefly, the 10-μL 
reaction system was composed of 5 μL of 2 × ChamQ Uni-
versal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China), 3  μL of 
RNase-free  H2O, 0.5  μL (5  μM) of each upstream primer 
and downstream primer and 1 μL of appropriately diluted 
cDNA template. The relative changes in gene expression 
from the qPCR experiment could be analysed using the  2−
ΔΔCT method [31].
LC–MS‑based metabolomics analysis
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-
based targeted metabolomics was performed according 
to the previously described protocol [30]. Cells (5 OD730 
unit) were harvested at 48 h via centrifugation at 7380 rpm 
for 5  min at 4  °C (Eppendorf 5430R), quenched, and rap-
idly extracted with 900  μL of 80:20 methanol/water (v/v; 
−80  °C pretreated) and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
Intracellular metabolites were extracted via three freeze/
thaw cycles. The aforementioned extraction process was 
repeated with another 500  μL of 80:20 methanol/water 
(v/v). The supernatant was combined and filtered through 
a 0.22-μm syringe filter. The solvents were removed using 
a vacuum concentrator system (ZLS-1, Hunan, China), 
and 100 μL of ddH2O was added and mixed well. LC–MS 
analysis was conducted using an Agilent 1260 series binary 
HPLC system equipped with a Synergi Hydro-RP (C18) 
150  mm × 2.0  mm ID, 4  μm 80  Å particle column (Phe -
nomenex, Torrance, CA, USA.), and an Agilent 6410 triple 
quadrupole mass analyser equipped with an electrospray 
ionization (ESI) source. Data were acquired using the Agi-
lent Mass Hunter work-station LC/QQQ acquisition soft-
ware (version B.04.01), and chromatographic peaks were 
subsequently integrated via Agilent Qualitative Analysis 
software (version B.04.00). All metabolomic profiling data 
were first normalized by the internal control and the cell 
numbers of the samples. Each condition analysis consisted 
of four biological replicates and three technical replicates.
Results and discussion
Effects of oxidative stress on cyanobacterial cell growth 
in the coculture system
With the potential to react with biomolecules, includ -
ing nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, ROS can cause

Ma et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2022) 15:69 
 
oxidative stress in cells, leading to cellular damage [32]. 
Previous studies pointed out the possibility that het -
erotrophic bacteria can reduce oxidative stress in the 
medium to improve the cell growth of cyanobacteria in 
a coculture system, eventually enhancing the stability of 
the coculture system [14, 15]. Ren et  al. selected ascor -
bate as an antioxidant to quench intracellular ROS in the 
microalgae Schizochytrium sp., which has great signifi -
cance in improving the production of DHA [33]. To test 
whether the relieved oxidative stress is the determining 
factor that affects the cell growth of cyanobacteria, dif -
ferent concentrations of ascorbic acid (0.1  mM, 1  mM, 
2  mM) were added to axenic cultured Synechococcus 
cscB+ in CoBG-11 medium [34–36]. Analysis showed 
that Synechococcus cscB + grew better with additional 
1 mM ascorbic acid in CoBG-11 compared with 0.1 mM 
ascorbic acid. Moreover, the growth rate of the strain in 
the coculture group (2.39  OD750/day) was significantly 
faster than that in the control (1.27  OD750/day) and 
1  mM Acs (1.44  OD750/day) groups. However, intrigu -
ingly, cell growth was inhibited after 3 days of incubation 
when supplemented with 2  mM ascorbic acid (Fig.  1A). 
Additionally, as expected, our results showed that the 
 H2O2 content was significantly decreased when ascor -
bic acid was added, and on Day 4, the  H2O2 content was 
not detectable in the condition supplemented with 2 mM 
ascorbic acid (Fig.  1B). Meanwhile, the intracellular ROS 
level was also significantly decreased when ascorbic acid 
was added (Fig.  1C). More importantly, although cyano -
bacterial growth was clearly improved with additional 
1 mM ascorbic acid under axenic culture, cyanobacterial 
growth was still slower than that in the coculture system, 
suggesting that except for the relieved oxidative stress, 
other critical factors also contributed to the improved 
growth of Synechococcus cscB+ in the coculture system.
Analysis of the transcriptional profiling 
of the cyanobacteria in the coculture system
Even though the relieved oxidative stress is beneficial for 
the cell growth of cyanobacteria in the coculture system, 
it is also of great significance to decipher the other fac -
tors contributing to the faster cell growth as well as the 
stability of the system. To explore the underlying mecha -
nisms, transcriptomic analysis between axenic culture 
cyanobacteria (C) and cocultured cyanobacteria (D) 
was conducted to analyse the transcriptional changes in 
cyanobacterial responses to the heterotrophic partner 
in the coculture system. With a cut-off of fold change 
 log2 > 1 and a p value of statistical significance less than 
0.05, we found 78 upregulated genes and 55 downregu -
lated genes in the cocultured cyanobacteria (Additional 
file  1: Tables S1 and S2). The reliability and accuracy of 
the transcriptomics data were independently verified by 
real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) (Additional file  3: 
Table  S3). Moreover, the correlation coefficient R 2 was 
0.9086 (Additional file  2: Figure S2), indicating that the 
transcriptomics data collected in this study are of very 
high accuracy. Transcriptomics analysis showed that the 
differentially expressed genes can be affiliated with most 
of the essential metabolic modules (Additional file  3: 
Figure S3), suggesting that the metabolic network of the 
cyanobacteria was reshaped in the coculture system.
Of them, significant decreases in transcripts of oxida -
tive stress-related genes were found in co-cultivated Syn -
echococcus cscB +, including high light-inducible protein 
M744_11065 (Hli), peroxiredoxin Q protein M744_03995 
(Tpx-Q), damage-inducible protein M744_11810 (DinB), 
flavoprotein (Flv) M744_06055 and M744_09730, indi -
cating possible reduced oxidative stress in co-cultivated 
Synechococcus cscB +. High light-induced proteins are 
critical for the energy dissipation mechanism to resist 
oxidative stress in cyanobacteria 37. He et al. found that 
the gene expression of 4 hlis  genes was induced under 
low temperature, strong light stress and nutrient defi -
ciency conditions in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (here -
after Synechocystis 6803), and the hli knockout mutant 
strain could not survive under strong light, suggesting 
that the high light-induced protein may play a photopro -
tective role [38]. Peroxiredoxin Q proteins are important 
for maintaining redox homeostasis in several organisms. 
Tailor et  al. found that overexpression of peroxiredoxin 
Q proteins can protect cyanobacteria from oxidative 
stresses [39]. Moreover, the expression of dinB  and flv 
was identified to be upregulated under stress tolerance 
[40, 41]. Consistent with these results, the downregula -
tion of these genes in the cocultured Synechococcus cscB+ 
demonstrated that oxidative stress was relieved in this 
artificial consortium. In a previous study, Vance et  al. 
found that the phospholipid/cholesterol/gamma-HCH 
transport system permease protein (MlaE) was down -
regulated after exposure to a high bisphenol A concen -
tration, which might inhibit phospholipid transport and 
subsequently alter the spontaneous diffusion of the mem-
brane to eventually cause membrane damage [42]. Inter -
estingly, the relative expression of M744_01095 (mlaE) 
was also increased in cocultured Synechococcus cscB +, 
which also suggested that oxidative stress-induced mem -
brane damage was relieved.
Moreover, compared with the axenic strain, riboso -
mal proteins (M744_13675, M744_13670, M744_05205, 
M744_05210, M744_12320, M744_05185), tRNA syn -
thetases ( M744_03935, M744_05340) and RNA bind -
ing protein (M744_12800) were significantly increased 
(Fig. 2, Additional file  1: Table S1), which indicated that 
an elevated protein translation and turnover rate might 
be required to support the high cell growth rate as well as 
Page 6 of 15Ma et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2022) 15:69 
to generate high expression-level heterologous enzymes 
such as cscB + 43. Proteins involved in the photosynthetic 
apparatus were significantly upregulated, thus suggest -
ing that photosynthesis in the cocultured cyanobacteria 
was reinforced, which is consistent with the observed 
improved cell growth (Fig.  1A). A previous study also 
showed that in cyanobacteria, oxidative stress could 
impair photosynthesis by downregulating the expression 
levels of the key genes in the photosystems 44. The obvi -
ous upregulation of the genes involved in photosynthesis 
further supported our hypothesis that the improved cell 
growth of cyanobacteria in the coculture system could be 
attributed to the relieved oxidative stress (Fig. 1B).
For interactions based on cross-feeding and metab -
olite exchange, early studies have shown that het -
erotrophic bacteria can improve the growth of 
cyanobacteria by scavenging oxygen and ROS and 
providing metabolites [45]. In this artificial consor -
tium, the consumption of sucrose to support the cell 
growth of E. coli and to produce 3-HP would release 
 CO2, which holds the potential to increase the carbon 
availability for cyanobacteria. However, intriguingly, 
the M744_08450 gene (cmpD  encoding a bicarbonate 
transporter) was significantly downregulated (Fig.  2, 
Additional file  1: Table  S2). This finding was consist -
ent with previous studies, in which researchers found

coculture system were cultivated in coculture medium (named CoBG-11) under a light intensity of approximately 100 μmol photons  m−2  s−1 in an 
illuminating shaking incubator at 150 rpm and 30 °C. CoBG-11 medium was designed based on BG-11 medium and optimized for E. coli growth by 
supplementing with 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM  NH4Cl and 3 g/L 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl) propan-2-yl] amino] ethanesulfonic acid (TES).  NH4Cl 
were used to maintain the cell survival of E. coli, and NaCl was used as a stress inducer for sucrose accumulation in Synechococcus 2973

that high  CO2 concentrations suppressed the expres -
sion levels of CCM-related proteins and the genes 
encoding bicarbonate transporters (CmpA and CmpC) 
[46, 47]. Taken together, these results suggested the 
consumption of sucrose in E. coli ABKm, which in 
turn provided more carbon dioxide to support the 
growth of cyanobacteria. This cross-feeding relation -
ship has been considered a key factor in stabilizing the 
long-term fermentation process in coculture systems 
[26]. Phosphorus (P) is an important nutrient central 
to storing and exchanging energy and information in 
cells [48]. Since part of the phosphate was used by E. 
coli in the coculture system, the remaining phosphate 
may be lower for cyanobacteria. The upregulated 
phosphate transporters, including the permease genes 
M744_04015 ( pstS, sphX) and M744_04030 ( pstA), in 
the cocultured Synechococcus cscB + strain suggested 
the competitive consumption of phosphate between 
those two strains, which also paved a new way towards 
the optimization of this system.
Differential proteomics analysis of Synechococcus cscB.+ 
between the coculture and axenic conditions
The low correlation between mRNA and protein expres -
sion, which may be caused by the widespread posttran -
scriptional regulation mechanism, has been found and 
well discussed in previous studies [49, 50]. For example, 
Nie et al. found that the correlation of mRNA expression 
and protein abundance was affected at a fairly signifi -
cant level by multiple factors related to translational effi -
ciency [51]. To fully identify the interaction mechanism 
in the coculture system, quantitative iTRAQ proteomics 
was conducted to analyse the cell responses of Synecho -
coccus cscB + in the coculture system. Three Synechococ -
cus cscB + samples from the coculture (D1, D2, D3) and 
three from the axenic culture (C1, C2, C3) were collected 
after cultivation for 96  h, and the differential profiles of 
proteins in Synechococcus cscB + were identified by set -
ting comparison groups of D1 vs. C1, D1 vs. C2, D1 vs. 
C3, D2 vs. C1, D2 vs. C2, D2 vs. C3, D3 vs. C1, D3 vs. 
C2, D3 vs. C3. The proteomic analyses identified a total 
Fig. 2 Transcriptomic analysis of Synechococcus cscB+ under coculture conditions compared with pure culture conditions. With a cut-off of 
fold change  log2 > 1 and a p value of statistical significance less than 0.05, the differentially expressed genes were selected. Upregulated and 
downregulated genes are labelled red and green, respectively
Page 8 of 15Ma et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2022) 15:69 
of 914,635 spectra, among which 21,603 unique spectra 
met the 1% FDR filter and were matched to 2206 unique 
proteins in the genome. In addition, good coverage was 
obtained for a wide MW range for protein (Additional 
file  4: Figure S4A). Most of the identified proteins had 
good peptide coverage; ~ 89% of the proteins had more 
than 10% sequence coverage, and ~ 87% had more than 
20% sequence coverage (Additional file  4: Figure S4B). 
Among the functional categories, the “general function 
prediction only” was the top detected functional cate -
gory, representing 13.43% of all identified proteins (Addi-
tional file  4: Figure S4C). This result is consistent with 
the previous finding that approximately 45% of proteins 
in the cyanobacterial genome are hypothetical proteins 
[52]. Other frequently detected functional categories 
included “translation, ribosome structure and biogenesis” 
(9.42%), “amino acid transport and metabolism” (8.67%), 
“posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaper-
ones” (8.51%), “signal transduction mechanism” (7.17%), 
and “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” (6.51%).
All 251 differentially expressed proteins were divided 
into 21 secondary branches of pathways based on the 
KEGG database classification, in which 181 differen -
tially regulated proteins were related to cell metabolism, 
including energy metabolism (10.36%), metabolism of 
cofactors and vitamins (10.36%), carbohydrate metab -
olism (10.36%), and amino acid metabolism (4.38%) 
(Fig.  3A). The number of up- and down-regulated pro -
teins in each annotated pathway is shown in Fig.  3B. 
The KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that seven 
pathways were significantly enriched (P value < 0.05) in 
the upregulated differential proteins, including “two-
component system” , “nitrogen metabolism” , and “biofilm 
formation-E. coli” , “lipoic acid metabolism” , “sulfur relay 
system” , “ ABC transporters” , and “glyoxylate and dicar-
boxylate metabolism” (Fig.  3C), while only “ ABC trans -
porters” was significantly enriched (P-value < 0.05) in the 
downregulated differential proteins (Fig.  3D). In addi -
tion, a low correlation coefficient (0.0605) was obtained 
between transcriptomics and proteomics, also indicating 
that posttranscriptional regulation may play significant 
roles (Additional file 5: Figure S5).
Functional analysis of the differential proteome 
in cocultured Synechococcus cscB+
Although transcriptomics and proteomics are critical 
to study the interaction mechanisms of the coculture 
system, the potential incompleteness of these different 
methods still hinders the full understanding of the bio -
logical responses. With complementary characteristics, 
multiple-omics analysis has been widely applied in deci -
phering the panorama of metabolic changes in cocul -
ture systems [27]. In the cocultured Synechococcus cscB + 
strain, transcriptomic analysis showed that a large frac -
tion (25%) of transcripts involved in photosynthesis and 
oxidative phosphorylation were significantly upregulated. 
Consistently, some of the differentially expressed proteins 
involved in the energy metabolism pathway were also 
observed in the proteomics data. Specifically, in cocul -
tured Synechococcus cscB +, proteins involved in energy 
metabolism, such as ferredoxin (PetF, M744_01325), phy-
cobiliprotein terminal rod linker (CpcD, M744_11425), 
photosystem II reaction centre H (PsbH, M744_01910), 
photosystem II D1 protein (PsbA, M744_00850), 
NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 4 (NadhD, 
M744_05920), and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreduc -
tase subunit 5 (NadhF, M744_01470), were upregulated 
(Fig. 4, Additional file 1: Table S4), suggesting that photo-
synthesis may be reinforced [53].
The cmp operon (cmpA, cmpB, cmpC, cmpD) in Syn -
echococcus 7942 has been confirmed to encode a com -
ponent of the ABC-type  HCO3− transporter BCT1, and 
its transcription was repressed under high  CO2 condi -
tions [46, 47]. The transcriptomics data showed that 
M744_08450 (encoding cmpD ) was significantly down -
regulated, while the changes in the other three genes in 
this operon were not obvious. Interestingly, proteomics 
analysis showed that M744_08440 (CmpB), M744_08445 
(CmpC), and M744_08450 (CmpD) were downregu -
lated (Additional file  1: Table  S4), which is consistent 
with our hypothesis that this repression may be induced 
by the elevated  CO2 in the coculture system. The down -
regulation of this bicarbonate transporter indicated 
that the concentration of  CO2 in the coculture system 
might be higher than that under axenic culture condi -
tions because the degradation of sucrose in E. coli ABKm 
might release  CO2 into the system, which in turn sup -
ported the higher cell growth of Synechococcus  cscB+. 
Furthermore, as the sucrose metabolism pathway was 
constructed for E. coli W, the extra  CO2 produced from 
E. coli ABKm from sucrose in coculture system could 
also be estimated according to a previous publication that 
 CO2 production rate in E. coli W was 16.31 ± 0.82 mmol 
 gDCW−1  h−1 [54], or approximately 0.718 g  CO2 in one 
hour by 1 g DCW E. coli W. Combined with the  CO2 sup-
plied by flask shaking which is roughly 3–5% [55, 56], 
the estimated ratio of  CO2 could be 6.73% (v/v) during 
cocultivation, which is indeed a high  CO2 condition for 
cyanobacteria.
Phosphorus is a vital nutrient for cyanobacterial 
growth. Those proteins involved in the phosphate trans -
port system, including M744_04030 (PstA), M744_04035 
(PstB), M744_04025 (PstC), M744_04020 (PstS) and 
M744_04015 (SphX), were upregulated by 2.08-, 
2.12-, 3.80-, 2.67- and 4.75-fold, respectively (Addi -
tional file  1: Table  S4), which is also consistent with 
Page 9 of 15
Ma et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2022) 15:69 
 
the transcriptomics data. Moreover, increased tran -
script levels of M744_04015 (sph X) and M744_04030 
(pstA) were also found. Instead of inorganic phosphate, 
dissolved organic phosphorus is used by cyanobac -
teria via alkaline phosphatase [57]. Interestingly, two 
alkaline phosphatases (M744_09635 and M744_11635) 
in co-cultivated Synechococcus cscB + were found to be 
upregulated by 2.89- and 1.40-fold, respectively, suggest -
ing that cyanobacteria would be able to acquire more 
organic phosphorus for cell growth during cocultivation

conditions [58]. This may be the effect of competition 
with E. coli for phosphate during coculture.
Our proteomics analyses also found that some proteins 
involved in the different metabolic modules showed dif -
ferential translation patterns that were not correlated 
with the transcriptomics data. For instance, increased 
protein abundance of light-independent protochloro -
phyllide reductase subunit B (ChlB) (M744_07280), 
which catalyses the conversion of protochlorophyllide 
to chlorophyllide a [59], was observed (Additional file  1: 
Table  S4), suggesting that the biosynthesis and turno -
ver rate of photosynthetic pigments might be improved 
during cocultivation. Nitrogen metabolism, either 
from nitrate or ammonium, governs the turnover of 
the macromolecules that regulate metabolic pathways, 
eventually affecting energy production and the carbon 
skeleton [60]. Through quantitative proteomics analy -
sis, three nitrate/nitrite transport system ATP-binding 
proteins, M744_10450 (NrtB), M744_10455 (NrtC), 
and M744_10460 (NrtD), and two ferredoxin-nitrite 
reductases (M744_10440 and M744_07195) were found 
to be upregulated in co-cultivated Synechococcus cscB +, 
suggesting that nitrite uptake in co-cultivated Synechoc -
occus cscB + was enhanced. Ammonium is incorporated 
into carbon skeletons through glutamine synthetase 
(M744_02210), which was also found to be upregulated 
in cocultured Synechococcus cscB + (Additional file  1: 
Table S4). Significant upregulation of the proteins in the 
nitrogen uptake and assimilation pathways was consist -
ent with the observed higher photosynthesis and better 
cyanobacterial growth under the coculture condition.
Regarding the relieved oxidative stress in the cocul -
ture system, proteomics data also revealed that proteins 
including Hli protein (M744_01810 and M744_11065) 
and fur family transcription regulator (Fur) (M744_05500 
and M744_12665) were downregulated in the co-cul -
tivated Synechococcus cscB + strain (Additional file  1: 
Table  S4). Of them, the downregulated transcripts of 
M744_11065 were identified and discussed in transcrip -
tomic data. In prokaryotes, Fur, usually as an iron uptake

regulator, is responsible for controlling the gene expres -
sion of siderophore biosynthesis and iron transport 61. In 
previous studies, it has been observed that the expression 
of the fur  gene was drastically upregulated under oxida -
tive stress conditions, suggesting the potential crosstalk 
between controlling iron homeostasis and defending 
against ROS [62]. By analysing the proteomics data, more 
clues were found. For instance, a significant decrease in 
the protein abundance of  Fe3+ transporters, including 
AfuA (M744_05470) and AfuB (M744_09555) [60], was 
observed from the proteomics data, which indicated 
that iron transportation in the cocultured Synechococ -
cus cscB + strain might be decreased. This downregula -
tion of iron transportation would be consistent with the 
relieved oxidative stress because iron catalysis is neces -
sary for the Haber–Weiss reaction, which generates the 
most reactive species •OH among all ROS from  H2O2 and 
 O2
•− [61]. Taken together, the downregulation of these 
proteins indicated that the heterotrophic partner could 
relieve oxidative stress, which is consistent with our pre -
vious findings that the expression levels of the three types 
of catalases, including hydroperoxidase I (katG), hydrop -
eroxidase II (katF), and hydroperoxidase III (katE), were 
significantly induced in E. coli under cocultivation condi -
tions [22].
Interestingly, the upregulation of the biosynthe -
sis of several micronutrients was also observed in the 
proteomics data. For example, cysteine desulfurase 
(M744_03415), which catalyses the conversion of 
L-cysteine to L-alanine and sulfur, was upregulated. In 
this reaction, the released sulfur is then transferred into 
scaffold protein to assemble Fe–S clusters [62], and these 
clusters have been shown to participate in electron trans-
fer, iron–sulfur storage, regulation of gene expression, 
photosynthesis, and enzyme activity in all kingdoms of 
life [63]. The upregulation of M744_03415 may be ben -
eficial for cyanobacteria to maintain higher cell growth 
during coculture. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) acts as 
a cofactor for several enzymes in key cellular metabolic 
pathways, such as glycolysis, the pentose phosphate path-
way and the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) [64]. Proteomic 
analysis showed that phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase 
(ThiC) (M744_11180), an essential enzyme for TPP bio -
synthesis, was upregulated in cocultured Synechococcus 
cscB+, suggesting enhanced central carbon metabolism in 
Synechococcus cscB+. In addition, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyru -
vyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate synthase 
(MenD, M744_09410), which is involved in the biosyn -
thesis of menaquinone and phylloquinone, was upregu -
lated. Menaquinones play important roles in electron 
transport and oxidative phosphorylation, and phylloqui -
none is the secondary electron carrier in photosystem 
I [65]. Therefore, the upregulation of MenD would be 
important in improving photosynthesis in the cocultured 
Synechococcus cscB+ strain.
Target LC–MS metabolomics analysis of Synechococcus 
cscB.+ in the coculture system
Aside from the transcriptomics and proteomics analy -
ses, targeted metabolomics is useful in quantifying the 
changes in the intracellular metabolites, which may pro -
vide us more insights into the cross-feeding mechanism 
in the coculture system. Previously, an LC–MS-based 
metabolomics approach was employed to comparatively 
analyse cellular metabolism in engineered cyanobacterial 
strains [66, 67]. In this study, it was applied to compare 
cocultured and axenic Synechococcus cscB +. As shown in 
Fig. 5, 21 metabolites involved in glycolysis, amino acids, 
and the TCA cycle were detected. Comparative analy -
sis showed that the intracellular contents of FBP , F6P , 
E4P , R5P and acetyl-CoA were increased. The increased 
pool size of the metabolites involved in central carbon 
metabolism indicates that the photosynthesis rate in the 
cocultured cyanobacteria was enhanced, which might 
contribute to more available carbon sources produced 
from the heterotrophic species in the coculture system. 
Five amino acids, lysine (Lys), serine (Ser), valine (Val), 
alanine (Ala) and phenylalanine (Phe), were found to 
be significantly upregulated in coculture cyanobacteria 
(Fig. 5). A previous study revealed that in symbiotic inter-
actions, autotrophic partners can secrete amino acids to 
support the cell growth of heterotrophic bacteria [27]. 
In this coculture system, the concentration of ammonia 
was approximately 4 mM, which is much lower than that 
in the standard M9 medium, which may cause nitrogen 
starvation for the E. coli strain. The upregulation of these 
amino acids would be secreted to compensate for the 
nitrogen demand of E. coli. Even though more evident 
data are needed, this hypothesis is of great significance 
to further optimize this coculture system. The abundance 
of the key metabolite in the TCA cycle, acetyl-CoA, was 
also increased (Fig.  5). It has been reported that the bio -
synthesis of acetyl-CoA in Synechococcus 2973 is phos -
phoketolase pathway dependent [68]. Consistently, by 
analysing the proteomics data, the key enzyme of the 
phosphoketolase pathway, xylose-5-phosphate/fructose 
6-phosphate phosphotransketolase (Xfp), was found to 
be upregulated in the cocultured Synechococcus cscB + 
strain. Additionally, because UPD-GCS and F6P are the 
key precursors of the sucrose biosynthetic pathway [69], 
the significant improvement of these two metabolites 
was consistent with the high sucrose biosynthesis and 
secretion in the cocultured cyanobacteria. Because stud -
ies have shown that the additional carbon sink would be

helpful for increasing photosynthesis in cyanobacteria 
[70], the increased sucrose sink strength may be another 
effective factor in enhancing the photosynthesis of cocul -
tured cyanobacteria. Taken together, these multiple 
omics analyses revealed that the enhanced cell growth 
of the cocultured Synechococcus cscB + strain may result 
from synergistic effects.
Conclusions
Stability and long-term productivity are two major 
parameters that determine the robustness of the artificial 
consortium. To further improve the performance of the 
coculture system, an integrated omics analysis was con -
ducted in this study to determine the interaction mech -
anism between cyanobacterium Synechococcus and E. 
coli. Our results showed that the improved cell growth of 
the cultured Synechococcus cscB + strain may result from 
synergistic effects, including relieved oxidative stress, 
enhanced  CO2 availability and increased sucrose sink 
strength. Multiple omics analyses indicate that many 
changes we identified tend to be linked with one another 
at different scales. Moreover, according to the omics 
analyses, the supply of phosphate and nitrogen in the 
Co-BG11 medium is not sufficient, which paves a new 
path towards the optimization of the performance of the 
coculture system. Taken together, all these results from 
the multiple omics analyses provide strong evidence that 
mutual interactions can be obtained from cross-feeding 
and competition between phototrophs and prokaryotic 
heterotrophs, which is indispensable for developing more 
intelligent artificial consortia.
