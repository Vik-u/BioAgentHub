Abstract: In nature, the D-enantiomers of amino acids (D-AAs) are not used for protein synthesis
and during evolution acquired speciﬁc and relevant physiological functions in diﬀerent organisms.
This is the reason for the surge in interest and investigations on these “unnatural” molecules observed
in recent years. D-AAs are increasingly used as building blocks to produce pharmaceuticals and
ﬁne chemicals. In past years, a number of methods have been devised to produce D-AAs based on
enantioselective enzymes. With the aim to increase the D-AA derivatives generated, to improve the
intrinsic atomic economy and cost-e ﬀectiveness, and to generate processes at low environmental
impact, recent studies focused on identiﬁcation, engineering and application of enzymes in novel
biocatalytic processes. The aim of this review is to report the advances in synthesis of D-AAs gathered
in the past few years based on ﬁve main classes of enzymes. These enzymes have been combined and
thus applied to multi-enzymatic processes representingin vitro pathways of alternative/exchangeable
enzymes that allow the generation of an artiﬁcial metabolism for D-AAs synthetic purposes.

1. Introduction
D-amino acids (D-AAs) are still considered the “unnatural” enantiomers of amino acids because
they are not used in protein synthesis [1]. The interest in D-AAs is related to their occurrence in nature as
free molecules or as components of biomolecules, their biological properties and peculiar biosynthetic
pathways, and for the expansion of analytical techniques for their quantiﬁcation [2]. Although D-AAs
do not exist in the nature as widely as their L-amino acids (L-AAs), naturally occurring D-AAs possess
diﬀerent and speciﬁc functions in di ﬀerent organisms (from a structural role as components of the
peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to act as neuromodulators in the mammalian brain) [ 3–5],
are present in a variety of foodstuﬀs (aﬀecting taste and ﬂavor), and are responsible of antimicrobial
and antiaging eﬀects [6].
D-AAs are increasingly becoming important building blocks to produce pharmaceuticals and
ﬁne chemicals. D-AAs are currently used as key components in β-lactam antibiotics, fertility drugs,
anticoagulants and pesticides; the semisynthetic antibiotics ampicillin and amoxicillin, which contain
D-phenylglycine and D-p-Hydroxy-phenylglycine, respectively, are produced on a scale>5000 tons
per year worldwide [7]. Furthermore, more than 20 D-AAs are produced at pilot- or full-scale levels.
During the years, a number of enzymes producing or metabolizing D-AAs have been discovered
and devised to produce D-AAs [8,9]. While each of these methods are useful, they often suﬀer from
various drawbacks including modest yields and enantioselectivity, low reaction rates, low titer of
starting material, and the demand for multiple steps. These weaknesses represented the driving force
that pushed numerous research groups worldwide to identify, engineer and apply enzymes in novel
biocatalytic processes aimed to generate D-AAs by more-sustainable processes.

The aim of this review is to report the advances in enzymatic synthesis of D-AAs reported in the
past few years. The presentation is based on the ﬁve main classes of enzymes used, even if they have
been frequently applied jointly in cascade, multi-enzymatic processes.
2. Aminotransferases
Transaminases, also named aminotransferases (EC 2.6.1.X), catalyze the transfer of an amino
group between an amino acid (donor) and a α-keto acid (acceptor) using a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
cofactor (PLP) [10].
2.1. D-Amino Acids Synthesis
In a pioneering work, the group of Kenji Soda reported the use of D-amino acid aminotransferase
(DAAT, EC 2.6.2.21) to generate D-AAs from the correspondingα-keto acids and ammonia by coupling
four enzymes [11]. In addition to DAAT from Bacillus subtilis sp. YM-1, which employs D-glutamate
as amino donor, glutamate racemase from Pediococcus pentosaceus (to convert L-glutamate into the
D-enantiomer), commercial glutamate dehydrogenase (to generate L-glutamate from α-ketoglutarate
and ammonia) and commercial formate dehydrogenase (to regenerate NADH) were used (Figure 1A).
D-valine, D-alanine, D-leucine, D-methionine D-aspartate and D-aminobutyrate have been synthesized
from the corresponding α-keto acid with a >80% yield.
An alternative approach was recently used to generate di ﬀerent tryptophan derivatives by
Parmeggiani [12] (Figure 1B). D-Tryptophan derivatives are important precursors of pharmaceuticals
and natural products, such as tadalaﬁl, lanreotide acetate, skyllamycin, metalloprotease inhibitors
for pain treatment, prenylated tryptophans, inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein, etc. In this
process, a three-enzymatic system was set up coupling the synthesis of L-tryptophan derivatives from
indoles by a tryptophan synthase from Salmonella enterica with the stereoinversion of the L-enantiomer
into the D-AA by the oxidative deamination due to L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD, EC 1.4.3.2) from
Proteus myxofaciens (PmaLAAD) and its transamination by a stereoselective D-aminotransferase variant
from Bacillus sp. YM-1 (the T242G variant engineered to be active on various D-tryptophan derivatives).
A total of 12 products containing electron-donating or withdrawing substituents at all benzene-ring
positions on the indole group were produced, with a conversion yield in the 81–99% range, an isolation
yield in the 63–70% range and an ee frequently >99%. This process was used at a preparative scale
(5 mmol of D-tryptophan corresponding to 1.02 g).
By using a bi-enzymatic system, the cheap and available natural amino acid L-methionine was
converted into D-homoalanine (Figure 1C) [ 13]. At ﬁrst, L-methionine γ-lyase from Fusobacterium
nucleatum catalyzed the conversion of L-methionine to 2-oxobutyrate, which was then aminated using
D-alanine as amino donor by the DAAT from Bacillus sp. into D-homoalanine with a 90% ee and 87.5%
conversion yield. The authors opted for the use of lyophilized whole cell systems.
While α-transaminases act on the α-amino groups, ω-transaminases abstract an amino group
from a non- α position or even from primary amines that do not contain a carboxy group.
ω-Transaminase from Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17 was used to convert 3-ﬂuoropyruvate into D-3-ﬂuoroalanine
using (S)-α-methylbenzylamine (α-MBA) as the amino donor; the process was hampered by a strong
inhibition by acetophenone (the product ofα-MBA deamination) [14]. This drawback was solved using
a biphasic reaction (water/isooctane): under optimized conditions, D-3-ﬂuoroalanine was produced
with 70% conversion and ee >99% using 40 mM racemic α-MBA, 30 mM 3-ﬂuoropyruvate and 3 U/mL
enzyme. A diﬀerent approach was used coupling the reaction of DAAT from Bacillus sphericus starting
from the α-keto acid and D-alanine to generate the corresponding D-AA and iminopyruvate, with a
variant of ω-transaminase from Arthrobacter sp. (ARTA) that converted the latter into D-alanine [15].
Using 450 mM iminopyruvate and 20 mM D-alanine, 2.02 g of D-phenylglycine were produced with
89% yield and ee >99%. Subsequently, the same group investigated the use of two ( R)-selective
ω-transaminases from Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus fumigatus in the asymmetric synthesis of
D-AAs from α-keto acids [16]. Such enzymes showed the highest amino donor reactivity for α-MBA,
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 3206 3 of 16
the absence of inhibition by acetophenone and the e ﬃcient use of α-keto acids corresponding to
D-alanine, D-homoalanine, D-fluoroalanine, D-serine and D-norvaline. The latter D-AAs were produced
with ee >99% and conversion yields in the 40–99% range(employing 60 mM racemic α-MBA, 20 mM
α-keto acid, 3 U/mL ω-transaminase and 0.1 mM PLP).

α-keto acids and ammonia by coupling: (A) four enzymes, namely D-amino acid aminotransferase,
glutamate racemase, glutamate dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase [ 11]; ( B) tryptophan
synthase from S. enterica, L-amino acid deaminase from P . myxofaciens and T242G variant of
D-aminotransferase variant from Bacillus sp. YM-1 for the synthesis of D-tryptophan derivatives [12];
(C) L-methionine γ-lyase from F. nucleatum and D-amino acid aminotransferase from Bacillus sp. to
convert L-methionine into D-homoalanine [13].
2.2. Resolution of Racemic Mixtures
Since D-enantiomers are frequently more expensive than the corresponding L-AAs, stereoinversion
represented a suitable way to generate D-AAs. On this side, D-phenylalanine was generated using
an Escherichia coli W14(pR15ABK) strain selected for its ability to produce L-phenylalanine and for
overexpressing the DAAT fromB. subtilis W600 [17]: D-phenylalanine production reached 1.73 g/L in a
15 L fermenter.
Most recently, stereoinversion and deracemization of phenylalanine derivatives containing
electron-donating or withdrawing substituents at diﬀerent positions on the phenyl ring were performed
using LAAD from Proteus mirabilis (PmLAAD), to convert the L-AA into the correspondingα-keto acid,
followed by an engineered D-selective aminotransferase from Bacillus sp. YM-1 (the variant harboring
the T242G substitution showed the best performance), (Figure 2A) [18]. The conversion was carried
out using two E. coli cell strains overexpressing separately the two enzymes, employed as a whole-cell
system, and 12 diﬀerent L-phenylalanines. D-phenylalanine derivatives were synthesized with high
enantiomeric excess (from 90% to >99%) from commercially available racemic mixtures or L-AAs.
The process was also used to a preparative-scale: 76.9 mg of D-4-ﬂuorophenylalanine was produced
with ee >99% and an isolated yield of 84%. D-phenylalanine derivatives are used as chiral building
blocks in the synthesis of important drugs, i.e., antibiotics, antidiabetics, and chemotherapeutic agents.
The biocatalytic approach represents a valid alternative to asymmetric Strecker reactions because of
the high enantioselectivity, as well as to fermentation processes that allow producing few substituted
D-phenylalanine derivatives.
In recent years, a number of authors used an amino acid dehydrogenase coupled to a D-selective
ω-transaminase to perform the deracemization and stereoinversion of racemic mixtures of amino acids
(Figure 2B). Recombinant alanine dehydrogenase fromB. subtilis and recombinant NADH oxidase from
Lactobacillus brevis (required to recycle NADH and produced in E. coli) were coupled to the engineered
ARTA in a one-pot reaction on 10 mM racemic alanine, serine or leucine, reaching a 80–99% ee [19].
Under optimized conditions, 100 mM D,L-alanine was deracemized in 24 h, using 1 mM NAD+ and
100 mM isopropylamine (>99% ee and 52% isolation yield).

3. D-Amino Acid Dehydrogenases
3.1. Synthesis of D-Amino Acids
The pioneering protein engineering work of Scott Novick [20] generated a highly stereoselective
D-amino acid dehydrogenase (DAADH, EC 1.4.99.1) starting from a meso-diaminopimelate
D-dehydrogenase (m-DAPDH) from Corynebacterium glutaricum. Three rounds of mutagenesis allowed
the generation of the BC621 variant harboring the D155G/Q151L/R196M/T170I/H245N substitutions,
able to produce D-AAs by reductive amination of the corresponding α-keto acids using NADPH
and ammonia. The enzyme showed a broad substrate preference and was used to generate various
D-AAs with >95% ee. Later on, the same enzyme was used to convert 4-Br-phenylpyruvic acid
into D-4-Br-phenylalanine (40–70% isolation yield and ee ranging 74–99%), which was subsequently
coupled with a panel of arylboronic acids to give D-biarylalanine derivates (Figure 3A), useful in
synthesis of inhibitors of botulinum toxin, of amyloid-β-peptide aggregation and of kinesin-14 motor
protein KIFC1 [21].
Alternative DAADHs were generated in recent years. The m-DAPDH from the thermophilic
Symbiobacterium thermophilum bacterium showed a reductive amination activity on various α-keto
acids [22]. Site-saturation mutagenesis at positions P146, T171, R181, H227 identiﬁed the H227V
variant showing a speciﬁc activity of 2.4µmol/min/mg protein on phenylpyruvic acid, corresponding to
a >35-fold increase compared to the wild-type enzyme [23]. An increased activity on bulky substrates
was observed for the W121L/H227I DAADH variant, e.g., 24- and 70-fold toward 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric
acid and phenylpyruvic acid, respectively. D-phenylalanine was generated with >99% ee and 85%
yield [24]. A multi-enzymatic system made of L-threonine ammonia lyase from E. coli, DAADH
and formate dehydrogenase (from Pseudomonas sp. 101 or Candida boidinii) was set up to produce
D-2-aminobutyric acid using L-threonine (Figure 3B). D-2-aminobutyric acid is used in the synthesis
of antibiotics, antiproliferatives and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, brain-permeable
polo-like kinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase. At 50 mL reaction scale, 200 mM L-threonine and
300 mM sodium formate generated D-2-aminobutyric acid in 20 h, with >90% yield and >99% ee,
with no need for external ammonia supplement [25].
An alternative DAADH is the m-DAPDH from Ureibacillus thermosphaericus strain A1 variant
containing ﬁve substitutions (introduced by site-saturation mutagenesis) that was used to synthesize
branched-chain D-AAs coupling DAADH and glucose oxidase /glucose system for NADPH
recycling [ 26]. After 2 h at 65 ◦C and pH 10.5, 2-oxo-4-methylvaleric acid was converted to
D-leucine with a 99% yield and >99% ee. This system was used to produce labeled D-AAs,
namely D-[1-13C,15N]leucine, D-[1-13C]leucine, D-[15N]leucine, D-[15N]isoleucine, and D-[15N]valine.
The D94A substitution prevented the steric clash with the side chain of large substrates; specific activity on
phenylpyruvate (16.1 µmol/min/mg at 50 ◦C) was 8-fold higher than that of the wild-type DAADH [27].
For a review concerning the protein engineering and the structural studies on thermostable artiﬁcial

DAADH, see [28]. A further option was the engineered m-DAPDH from B. sphaericus; co-expression
in E. coli cells of this DAADH with glucose dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter oxidans allowed the
production of D-5,5,5-triﬂuoronorvaline, an intermediate in the synthesis of the γ-secretase inhibitor
BMS-708163 [29] from the corresponding α-keto acid: the preparation reached the 50 kg scale, with
>98.6% ee and 89% yield.

by: (A) direct conversion by engineered D-amino acid dehydrogenase of 4-Br-phenylpyruvic acid into
D-4-Br-phenylalanine, subsequently coupled with a panel of arylboronic acids to give D-biarylalanine
derivates [21]; (B) the multi-enzymatic system made ofE. coli L-threonine ammonia lyase, D-amino acid
dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase converted L-threonine into D-2-aminobutyric acid [25].
3.2. Stereoinversion of L-Amino Acids
LAAD and DAADH were used for the stereoinversions of L-AAs into D-AAs, Figure 4. L-Phenylalanine
was deaminated to phenylpyruvic acid usingE. colicells expressing PmLAAD, followed by stereoselective
reductive amination with recombinant m-DAPDH from S. thermophilum (both the wild-type and
the H227V variants) to produce D-phenylalanine; formate dehydrogenase was used to regenerate
NADPH. D-phenylalanine, as well as the D-enantiomer of glutamate, homophenylalanine and 2-, 3-,
or 4-chlorophenylalanine were produced in quantitative yield and with>99% ee (using a 10 mM solution of
the L-enantiomer, 20 mM sodium formate and 1 mM NADP+) [30]. D-Phenylalanine and D-arylalanines
are components of natural products such as antibacterial peptides (i.e., fungisporin, polymyxin,
gramicidin) and alkaloids, and ingredients of antidiabetics (i.e., nateglinide), anti-inﬂammatory formyl
peptide receptor 1 antagonists, anticoagulants, cyclic plasmin inhibitors and melanocortin 4 receptor
agonists for the treatment of obesity. On this side, an engineered DAADH obtained by mutagenesis
of m-DAPDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (harboring the N150L/D154G/T169I/R195M/H244E
substitutions) was coupled with PmLAAD and the NADPH recycling system made of glucose
oxidase/glucose [31]. The reaction resulted in excellent enantioselectivity ( >98%) and good yields
(69–93%) at the preparative scale (100 mg) across a broad range of D-arylalanines/D-phenylalanine
derivatives and using cheaper L- or D,L-amino acid substrate mixtures.

4. Hydantoinase Process
The “hydantoinase process” is an industrial multi-enzymatic system in which hydantoin racemase
catalyzes the racemization of L- or D-hydantoin, D-hydantoinase hydrolyzes D-hydantoin to the
corresponding d-N-carbamoyl-amino acid, then converted into D-AAs by D-carbamoylase (Figure 5).
Various D-AAs have been successfully synthesized at industrial scale by this dynamic kinetic resolution
cascade process, with high yield and enantioselectivity; for a review, see [32]. D-Valine, an important
organic chiral precursor used for the synthesis of agricultural pesticides, semisynthetic veterinary
antibiotics and pharmaceutical drugs, has been successfully produced by the hydantoinase process,
reaching 88% of conversion in 48 h starting from 50 g/L of D,L-5-isopropylhydantoin, see [33]. In order to
bypass some limitations in this promising strategy, the D-carbamoylase fromArthrobacter crystallopoietes
was recently identiﬁed: it is more compatible with the hydantoinase process conditions, is produced in
a soluble form and shows a substrate preference for aromatic carbamoyl compounds [34]. By combining
this D-carbamoylase with Arthrobacter aurescens hydantoin racemase and Agrobacterium tumefaciens
D-hydantoinase, 80 mM L-indolylmethylhydantoin was converted into D-tryptophan (99.4% yield and
>99.9% ee) within 12 h and with a productivity of 36.6 g/L/day (at 0.5 L scale). D-Tryptophan is used to
produce important drugs in the treatment of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension
(i.e., contryphans and tadalaﬁl), peptides for the treatment of dermatitis (i.e., tyrocidines C and D,
or Thymodepressin) and as sweetener for food industry.
Figure 5. The application of the hydantoinase process to the synthesis of D-tryptophan. In this
case, hydantoin racemase from A. aurescens was coupled to D-hydantoinase from A. tumefaciens and
D-carbamoylase from A. crystallopoietes [34].
5. Ammonia Lyases
Ammonia lyases (E.C. 4.3.1.X) are enzymes that catalyze the reversible deamination of unsaturated
or cyclic amino acids. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24, belonging to class-I lyase
family), that catalyzes the deamination of L-phenylalanine to produce cinnamic acid, a precursor
of several secondary metabolites in plants, bacteria and fungi, represents the most biotechnological
relevant member [ 35]. Interestingly, PAL’s activity relies on a peculiar electrophilic cofactor
(4-methylideneimidazol-5-one, MIO) derived from the condensation of three residues at the active site
(Ala167, Ser168, and Gly169 in Anabena variabilis PAL, AvPAL). The advantages of PAL’s exploitation in
biocatalysis are: no requirement for cofactor supplementation, no recycling systems and, in most cases,
an absolute regioselectivity, see [36].
5.1. Production of D-Amino Acids by Enantioselective Deamination
The exploitation of PAL to produce optically pure D-AAs follows three major biocatalytic
approaches. In the enantioselective deamination approach, the enzyme has been used (mainly as
a whole cell) to remove the L-enantiomer from a racemic mixture to leave the unreacted D-AA.
The generated α-keto acid can be easily separated from the D-AA by precipitation or column
separation [37]. On this side, the I460V variant of Petroselinum crispum PAL (PcPAL) was recently
used in preparative scale biotransformation to eﬃciently produce D-m-(triﬂuoromethyl)phenylalanine
(39% yield, 93% ee) and D-p-methylphenylalanine (49% yield, 95% ee), intermediates for the synthesis
of inhibitors of lysine methyltransferase 7 and prolyl isomerase (anti-cancer drugs) [38,39] (Figure 6A).
A recent evolution of this approach is represented by the immobilization of the biocatalyst with
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 3206 7 of 16
the aim to improve stability and facilitate recovery. PAL from Rhodotorula glutinis immobilized
on a silica support has been used in a recirculating packed-bed reactor to produce optically pure
D-phenylalanine from the racemic mixture [ 40]. The resolution process was scaled up to 25 L of
100 mM racemic amino acid obtaining a maximal productivity of 7.2 g/L/h D-phenylalanine (≈95% yield
and 99% ee). The reactor could be operated 16 consecutive times without signiﬁcant decrease in
performances. PALs have recently been immobilized also on advanced supports such as nanomaterials;
PAL from parsley has been immobilized on single-walled carbon nanotubes and used in a packed-bed
continuous-ﬂow microreactor for the kinetic resolution of racemic 2-amino-3-(thiophen-2-yl) propanoic
acid. The enzyme could be used for seven consecutive cycles maintaining a conversion yield>42% [41].
PcPAL was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles allowing its use in a Lab on a Chip magnetic system,
a reliable tool for microscale biotransformation and automated screenings of substrates [42]. This system
demonstrated the ability of PcPAL (subsequently conﬁrmed by a preparative biotransformation) to
catalyze the enantioselective deamination of D,L-propargylglycine, which represents the sole non-cyclic
relevant substrate of PALs (Figure 6B) [43].
Figure 6. The application of PcPAL in D-AAs synthesis. (A) Resolution of substituted D-phenylglycines
by the I460V PcPAL variant [39]. (B) Preparation of enantiopure D-propargylglycine by enantioselective
deamination of L-propargylglycine catalyzed by PcPAL immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles [43].
5.2. Production of D-Amino Acids by Enantioselective Hydroamination
Under high ammonia concentration, the deamination reaction catalyzed by PALs is reversible,
leading to the non-reductive hydroamination of substituted cinnamic acids (aryl α,βunsaturated
carboxylic acids) by an anti-Michael addition of ammonia. The stereochemistry of this latter reaction
is very high for the production of the L-AA (ee for the L-enantiomers is usually >99%), but when
the aromatic ring of cinnamic acid is substituted with an electron abstracting group (e.g., p/o-NO2 or
pyridyl-alanines), a signiﬁcant fraction of the product is represented by the D-enantiomer. This is
due to ability of electron-deﬁcient structures to stabilize a negative charge at the benzylic position.
Investigation of the addition reaction demonstrated that the formation of D-AAs by PAL-catalyzed
hydroamination occurs via a MIO-independent pathway which is not enantioselective [44]. The best ee
toward the D-AA was obtained using R. glutinis PAL on pNO2-phenylalanine (corresponding to 55%
of the D-AA). Similar results have been obtained also using PALs from diﬀerent sources, i.e., AvPAL or
PcPAL (Figure 7A) [44].

5.3. Production of D-Amino Acids by One-Pot Deracemization Reaction
With the aim to achieve a full production of D-AAs, the (almost) asymmetric hydroamination
of substituted cinnamic acids to produce non-natural D-phenylalanines catalyzed by AvPAL was
coupled to the enantioselective deamination reaction catalyzed by LAAD. PmLAAD, expressed
in E. coli and used as a whole-cell biocatalyst, stereospeciﬁcally deaminated the L-enantiomer
of the substituted phenylalanine (produced by PAL) yielding the corresponding imino acid that,
in turn, was asymmetrically reduced back to the racemic amino acid by ammonia-borane (NH3BH3).
The iteration of these two reactions lead to the accumulation of the D-AA. Using the wild-type
AvPAL (as a whole-cell biocatalyst),pNO2-cinnamic acid was converted into pNO2-D-phenylalanine
(71% yield and 96% ee) (Figure 7B) [45]. The enzymatic activity of AvPAL has been enhanced through
a semi-rational (site-saturation mutagenesis) approach; the best variant (H359Y) showed a ≈3.5-fold
higher activity with no improvement in stereospeciﬁcity toward the D-product. Using this variant,
an up to 80% yield with an ee between >98% was reached using diﬀerent substituted cinnamic acids as
substrate. Since the deracemization step involving PmLAAD exhibits a very high eﬃciency, the cascade
bioconversion could also be used for the full stereoinversion of substituted L-phenylalanines [45].
Figure 7. The application of AvPAL in D-AAs synthesis. (A) Production of substituted D-phenylalanines
by enantioselective hydroamination of cinnamic acid derivatives using AvPAL [44]. (B) Production
of pNO2-phenylalanine from the corresponding racemate employing AvPAL,P . mirabilisD-amino acid

D-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)alanine from2,4,5-triﬂuoro-cinnamic acid generated from triﬂuorobenzaldehyde
using the DAAT T242G variant from Bacillus sp. YM-1, PmLAAD and AvPAL [47].
A di ﬀerent variant of AvPAL (N347A), possessing a 2.3-fold higher D-enantioselectivity in
comparison with the wild-type enzyme, was active toward aromatic amino acids possessing strong
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 3206 9 of 16
electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., pNO2-phenylalanine) [45]. The N347A AvPAL variant was
used with PmLAAD in a one-pot deracemization bioprocess; the best results have been reached
with mF- and pNO2-phenylalanines (91% and 96% yield, respectively, and >99% ee). Interestingly,
the N347A AvPAL variant was also active on phenylalanines possessing strongly electron-donating
groups (e.g., mCH3- or pOH-phenylalanines), although the conversion rates were much lower (23% and
26% yield, respectively) [46].
The main drawback of this approach is the cost associated to the large excess (40 equivalents) of
ammonia-borane as the chemical reducing agent requested to avoid the production the α-keto acid
side product (Figure 7B). In order to overcome this limitation, the asymmetric chemical reduction of
the imino acid intermediate was replaced by the enantioselective amination of the α-keto acid to the
D-AA catalyzed by DAAT [47]. This approach was used to produce D-(2,4,5-triﬂuoro-phenyl)alanine,
the precursor of the antihyperglycemic drug sitagliptin (approved by FDA for the treatment of type
2 diabetes) [47]. The whole biocatalytic process started from triﬂuoro-cinnamic acid, prepared by
one-step condensation between triﬂuorobenzaldehyde and malonic acid, which was converted to
L-triﬂuoro-phenylalanine by AvPAL (in 2.5 M NH3/CO2 buﬀer) and, in turn, fully stereoinverted to the
D-AA by the coupled oxidative deamination of the L-AA to its corresponding α-keto acid and the
subsequent enantioselective amination to the D-enantiomer catalyzed by DAAT (using D-aspartate as
the amino donor). Both LAAD and DAAT were added as whole-cell biocatalysts. Since high ammonia
concentrations are detrimental to the enzymes involved in the deracemization, the reaction mixture
has been diluted with an equal volume of water after the hydroamination catalyzed by PAL before
adding LAAD and DAAT [47] (Figure 7C). As a proof of concept, a complete biotransformation of
50 mM triﬂuoro-cinnamic acid to D-triﬂuoro-phenylalanine was reached in a few hours. The product
was isolated incubating the reaction with recombinant bovine D-aspartate oxidase (whole cells) to
eliminate D-aspartate, followed by ion exchange puriﬁcation a ﬀording a 67% yield. In addition,
inexpensive ammonium carbamate (that can be easily removed by sublimation) [37] can be used as
ammonium source, rendering the whole process more economically and virtually feasible within an
industrial setting [47].
6. L-Amino Acid Oxidases and L-Amino Acid Deaminases
L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO, EC 1.4.99.B3) and L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD, EC 1.4.99.B3)
catalyze the enantioselective oxidation of L-amino acids to their imino form that spontaneously
deaminate forming the corresponding α-keto acid. The main diﬀerence between the two enzymes is
the electron acceptor, that is molecular oxygen (with production of hydrogen peroxide) in the case of
LAAO while, in the case of LAAD, it is a component of the bacterial membrane electron-transport
chain (with the ﬁnal production of water) [48–50].
6.1. Production of D-Amino Acids by Enantioselective Deamination/Deracemization Using L-Amino Acid Oxidase
The availability of recombinant microbial D-amino acid oxidase variants with improved properties
allowed the setup of several protocols to produce optically pure natural or unnatural L-AAs [51,52].
Unfortunately, the unavailability of suitable recombinant LAAOs, prevented the eﬀective application
of similar approaches to produce optically pure D-AAs [52]. Recently, LAAO from the actinomycete
Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (RebO) was used in the synthesis of halogenated derivatives of D-tryptophan
using a bienzymatic cascade system (Figure 8A). Halogenated L-tryptophan derivatives were prepared
from L-tryptophan by tryptophan halogenases specific for position 5, 6 or 7 of the indole side chain.
The L-enantiomer was then stereoinverted by the combined use of L-Enantioselective RebO and the
non-enantioselective reducing agent ammonia-borane. This system allowed reaching ee≈100% for
six out of eight tested substrates. In a quantitative conversion (1 mM substrate), halogenation of
tryptophan to L-5-Br-tryptophan was achieved in 3−5 h by halogenase in the form of cross-linked enzyme
aggregate CLEA (comprising also auxiliary enzymes for cofactor regeneration). L-5-Br-tryptophan was
then fully stereoinverted to the D-AA (49% yield, 92% ee) after 24 h of incubation with RebO (as a
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 3206 10 of 16
crude lysate) and ammonia-borane. Similar results were obtained for D-7-Br-tryptophan (44% yield,
>98% ee). Drawbacks of this system are the need for a very high stoichiometric excess of the reducing
agent (100 equivalents), the need of catalase to remove H2O2 produced by RebO, and the generation
of the side productα-Hydroxy acid derivative (≈10% of the total product) due to chemical reduction
of the α-keto acid [53]. It is generally accepted that during evolution, generalist enzymes acquired a
narrower enzyme specificity , thus, ancestral variants of native enzymes could possess a broader substrate
specificity [54]. According to this concept, Nakano and colleagues produced a potential ancestral variant
(AncLAAO) of LAAO fromPseudoalteromonas piscicida.AncLAAO showed significant activity towards
seven proteinogenic L-AAs (relative activity >20%, the best being L-glutamine and L-methionine)
and on several substituted tryptophans and phenylalanines. AncLAAO was employed to deracemize
four substituted phenylalanines(2-ﬂuoro-, 3-ﬂuoro-, 4-nitro-, and 3,4,5-triﬂuoro-phenylalanine) and
phenylglycine at a preparative scale (100 mL of 10 mM racemate corresponding to 151–210 mg of
substrate, in a reaction mixture containing 150 mM NH 3BH3, 200 U catalase, at 30 ◦C, Figure 8B).
The reaction required a 10-fold higher amount of the biocatalyst in the case of phenylglycine
(70 mg vs. 7 mg required for the deracemization of phenylalanines). A >99% ee was obtained
for the phenylalanine derivatives (after a 24 h reaction time) whereas 84% ee was for phenylglycine.
One main advantage in using AncLAAO is represented by the very high recombinant expression level
in E. coli: 50 mg/L fermentation broth [55].

the D-AA [53]. ( B) Application of ancestral variant of LAAO (AncLAAO) in the deracemization of

6.2. Production of D-Amino Acids by Enantioselective Deamination/Deracemization Using L-Amino
Acid Deaminase
A promising alternative to LAAOs as biocatalyst for the enantioselective oxidative deamination
of L-AAs is represented by LAADs [48]. The main advantages are the broad substrate speciﬁcity and
the absence of H2O2 production, this resulting in a lower toxicity during its recombinant expression
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 3206 11 of 16
in E coli, an increased stability of the enzyme and reaction products during the reaction, and the
elimination of catalase from the reaction mixture. LAADs can be used as whole-cell biocatalysts or in
the pure form, the latter requiring the addition of puriﬁed bacterial membranes containing a suitable
electron acceptor. On this side, it has been recently demonstrated that the bacterial membranes can be
replaced by the artiﬁcial electron acceptor represented by 0.8 mM phenazine methosulfate and the
anionic detergents SDS (0.1 mM) [50].
One of the ﬁrst examples reported the application of LAAD (as whole E. coli recombinant cells)
to produce pure D-AAs from the racemic mixture; after the oxidation of the L-AA to the imino
acid intermediate, the latter compound was non-enantiomerically reduced by 40 equivalents of
ammonia-borane. This approach has been used to produce several proteinogenic (e.g., D-leucine or
D-methionine) or non-proteinogenic (e.g., o-benzyl-D-serine or D-norleucine,) optically pure apolar
D-AAs (the sole exception being histidine) obtaining reaction yields ranging from 64% to 99% and ee up
to 99% in most cases [56]. D-2-amino-3-(7-methyl-1 H-indazol-5-yl)propanoic acid (a drug building
block) has been produced coupling the reaction of PmLAAD in combination with a DAAT fromBacillus
thuringiensis: a 92% yield (79% after product puriﬁcation) with a>99% ee was achieved. Notably, 1.79 kg
of product were isolated (62% isolated yield and 98.6% ee) on a pilot scale using a commercial DAAT.
The main drawback of this approach is the need of D-alanine as the DAAT amino donor and of an
additional pyruvate removal reaction requiring NADH recycling [57]. Recently, PmLAAD has been
expressed together with two additional enzymes in an artiﬁcial enzyme cascade in E. coli with the aim
to produce benzyl alcohol analogs. This approach demonstrated the ability of PmLAAD to produce
optically pure D-m-ﬂuoro-phenylalanine from the corresponding racemic mixture [58]. In addition,
a 4-point variant of this enzyme has been exploited to produce D-phenylalanine, exhibiting a conversion
of 49.5% after 7 h [59]. For recent applications of LAAD from Proteus to produce D-AA by enzymatic
cascades, see also paragraph 2 [45,46]. LAAD from P . mirabilis(originally termed L-amino acid oxidase)
has been recently immobilized on Ca-alginate beads and employed for producing D-phenylalanine
following the deamination of the L-AA [60].
The recent setup of a simple and e ﬃcient one-step puriﬁcation protocol of a deletion variant
of PmaLAAD (lacking the native N-terminal signal peptide) and the solution of its 3D structure
boosted its exploitation as a puriﬁed biocatalyst [ 49]. PmaLAAD was used in deracemization
of proteinogenic hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, L-methionine, and
L-tryptophan), non-proteinogenic amino acids (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and even unnatural
amino acids such as substituted alanines (e.g., 3-pyridyl- or naphthyl-alanines). Starting from the
racemic mixture, almost 100% of conversion of the L-AA into the corresponding α-keto acid was
obtained, leaving only the D-form in solution. The coupling of the reaction with a non-enantiomeric
in situ reduction step (by 5 equivalents tert-butylamine) allowed the full stereoinversion of 12.5 mM
L-4-NO2-phenylalanine into the corresponding D-enantiomer in 2 h (99% ee) (Figure 9A) [61]. Based on
the available 3D structure of PmaLAAD, variants showing improved activity towards substituted
naphthylalanines were generated by site-saturation mutagenesis (Figure 9B). The triple variant
F318A/V412A/V438P PmaLAAD was employed for the full deracemization of a solution of 1.2 mM
D,L-1-naphthylalanine, achieving >90% conversion of the L-enantiomer in a reaction time ∼7.5-fold
lower than the wild-type enzyme [ 62]. For additional examples of the exploitation of LAAOs and
LAAD in multi-enzymatic cascades, see above.

7. Conclusions
The advances in the past ﬁve years, as compared to the previously reported methods for D-AAs
production, focused on the intrinsic atomic economy and the low environmental impact of the process.
Some of the most relevant successes were:
- the full conversion of enantiomeric solutions of amino acids into the D-enantiomer;
- the production of a variety of unnatural D-AA derivatives by means of novel enzymes, both isolated
from natural sources (e.g., LAADs) and generated by protein engineering (DAADHs and ARTA);
- the optimization of the hydantoinase process by the identiﬁcation of well-suited enzymes that
rendered it one of the most promising strategies to achieve economic and enantioselective
synthesis of D-AAs;
- the synthesis by multi-enzymatic processes of phenylalanine and tryptophan, and their derivatives,
is now a reality [12,34,53];
- the establishment of an attractive synthetic method for D-2-aminobutyric acid by the reductive
amination of 2-oxobutyric acid by DAADH [25];
- the enantioselective deamination of L-AAs by enzymes immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles
in a microﬂuidic reactor [43].
As stated by Stefano Servi, “the interconversion of functional groups is the main objective of
biocatalysis, and systems organizing a series of enzymes to achieve multistep reactions represent the
advanced target of enzymatic catalysis for organic synthesis” [63]. The plethora of enzymes related to
D-AAs allow now to consider them as an appropriate example of “systems biocatalysis”, i.e., in vitro
pathways of alternative/exchangeable enzymes that allow the generation of an artiﬁcial metabolism for
synthetic purposes.
