Abstract
Sepsis is the most frequent risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill infants. Sepsis-
induced dysregulation of kidney microcirculation in newborns is unresolved. The objective of this 
study was to use the translational swine model to evaluate changes in kidney function during 
the early phase of sepsis in newborns and the impact of fluid plus norepinephrine resuscitation. 
Newborn pigs (3–7-day-old) were allocated randomly to three groups: 1) sham, 2) sepsis (cecal 
ligation and puncture) without subsequent resuscitation, and 3) sepsis with lactated Ringer 
plus norepinephrine resuscitation. All animals underwent standard anesthesia and mechanical 
ventilation. Cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate were measured noninvasively. Mean 
arterial pressure, total renal blood flow, cortical perfusion, medullary perfusion, and medullary 
tissue oxygen tension (mtPO2) were determined for 12 h. Cecal ligation and puncture decreased 
mean arterial pressure and cardiac output by more than 50%, with a proportional increase 
in renal vascular resistance and a 60–80% reduction in renal blood flow, cortical perfusion, 
medullary perfusion, and mtPO2 compared to sham. Cecal ligation and puncture also decreased

glomerular filtration rate by ~79% and increased AKI biomarkers. Isolated foci of tubular necrosis 
were observed in the septic piglets. Except for mtPO2, changes in all these parameters were 
ameliorated in resuscitated piglets. Resuscitation also attenuated sepsis-induced increases in the 
levels of plasma C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine 
transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and renal NLRP3 inflammasome. These data suggest 
that newborn pigs subjected to cecal ligation and puncture develop hypodynamic septic AKI. Early 
implementation of resuscitation lessens the degree of inflammation, AKI, and liver injury.

BACKGROUND
Sepsis is an overwhelming host response to infection that results in devastating and 
life-threatening organ dysfunction, frequently comprising acute kidney injury (AKI) (1). 
Forty-nine million people are estimated to be affected by sepsis yearly, and more than 11 
million deaths result from this syndrome (2). Sepsis is also the leading cause of death in 
critically ill infants globally and the most frequent risk factor for AKI in this population, 
accounting for approximately 45–70% of cases of AKI in pediatric intensive care units (1,3). 
The development of AKI increases mortality by about 30% in pediatric septic patients (4). 
Newborns are at extreme risk of severe septic infection because of their immature immune 
systems. Therefore, infants with sepsis-induced AKI come down with worse outcomes, such 
as lengthy hospital admissions, higher mortality rates, reduced quality of life, and risk of 
long-term disability (4–6).
Septic AKI is characterized by reduced kidney function that manifests with elevated plasma 
creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine 
output within 7 days of sepsis onset (7–9). Septic AKI can be categorized as early or 
late. Early septic AKI develops within 48 h of sepsis, while AKI occurring between 
48 h and 7 days of sepsis onset is late septic AKI (10). The pathophysiology of this 
disease is poorly understood, especially in infants. Sepsis-induced AKI is a complex 
disorder that occurs because of infections, host response to infection, or indirect mechanistic 
processes caused by the consequences of sepsis or sepsis therapy (11). Multiple mechanisms 
such as macrocirculatory dysregulation and microcirculatory dysfunction, systemic and 
renal inflammation, cellular metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxia, 
oxidative stress, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system dysfunction have been implicated 
in the pathogenesis of septic AKI. These diverse pathophysiological mechanisms involved 
in septic AKI make the development of specific effective therapy for the treatment or 
prevention of this disorder challenging (10).
Newborns possess several distinct physiological features pre-disposing to septic AKI (12). 
Renal vascular resistance is elevated in newborns. The neonatal kidney only receives 5–10% 
of cardiac output (COP), resulting in reduced total renal blood flow (RBF) compared to 20–
25% in adults (12,13). Newborns have limited autoregulatory capacity to control the effects

of mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations on kidney functions (14). Moreover, the unique 
immune phenotype in early life (15,16) and immature myocardial function (17) increase 
newborn susceptibility to severe septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction (15,18). These 
factors indicate that the pathophysiologic mechanisms and disease phenotype of neonatal 
septic AKI may differ from adults (19).
There are very few studies on sepsis-induced AKI in the pediatric population compared 
to the abundant literature on adult sepsis and septic AKI. Altered renal macrocirculation 
and hypoperfusion were previously considered to be the main mechanisms of septic 
AKI. Still, many experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that AKI develops 
in sepsis regardless of preserved or elevated RBF (20). These findings suggest that the 
intra-renal mechanisms driving this disorder are yet to be resolved (20). The role of renal 
microcirculatory dysregulation resulting in renal tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the 
pathogenesis of septic AKI has not been fully elucidated, especially in newborns (21,22).
The current interventions for neonatal septic AKI involve antimicrobial therapy, vasopressor 
therapy, volume resuscitation, and renal replacement therapy. They are mostly focused 
on mechanisms upstream from the kidney or, at best, supportive strategies to keep the 
patients alive, hoping the kidney function will eventually recover (23,24). Therefore, 
uncovering novel therapeutic approaches for managing sepsis-induced AKI that will ensure 
the transition from supportive treatment strategies is pertinent, but this is dependent on 
the understanding of the complicated pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease in 
newborns (23). Most experimental studies on septic AKI use adult animal models; hence, 
translating their findings to newborns may not produce the most appropriate therapeutic 
or pharmacological effects due to the immaturity of the cardiovascular system and 
immunological responses in newborns (15,18).
Early detection and treatment of sepsis-related dysregulation of tissue perfusion are critical 
to reducing mortality in septic shock patients (24). Early fluid and vasopressor resuscitation 
is the standard of care for sepsis patients to ensure recovery from hypotension and sustain 
adequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery (23). Previous studies have revealed that early 
norepinephrine (NE) treatment in hypotensive septic patients increases COP and improves 
microcirculation (25). However, patients may also become unresponsive to NE and develop 
refractory hypotension and septic shock, with prolonged and high doses of NE associated 
with increased mortality and impaired organ function (26).
Early identification, management, and suitable resuscitation are crucial for improving 
survival rates in infants with septic AKI. However, few studies have investigated the role 
of volume resuscitation and vasopressor therapy in newborns. Unlike swine, rodents are poor 
models of human infant kidney pathophysiology. In this study, we use the translational swine 
model to evaluate the changes in renal hemodynamics during the early phase of sepsis in 3- 
to 7-day-old piglets. We also examined the impact of early fluid plus NE resuscitation on 
renal hemodynamics in the setting of newborn septic AKI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All procedures followed national standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. The 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science 
Center, Memphis, reviewed and approved the protocol (# 21-0276). Male newborn pigs (3–7 
days old) obtained from Nichols Hog Farm (Olive Branch, MS) were allocated randomly 
to three groups: 1) sham with no cecal manipulation (sham); 2) cecal ligation and puncture 
(CLP)-induced sepsis without subsequent resuscitation (CLP), (3) CLP-resuscitated sepsis 
with early fluid and NE administration (CLP + RST). The size of our piglet groups was 
established based on studies with the same porcine model of neonatal sepsis by us and other 
labs (27–29).
Anesthesia and mechanical ventilation
The newborn pigs were anesthetized using a mixture of 20 mg/kg of ketamine (100 
mg/mL, Covetrus, Dublin, OH) and 2.2 mg/kg of Xylazine (100 mg/mL, Covetrus, Dublin, 
OH), administered intramuscularly into the semimembranosus muscle of the rear leg. 
Subsequently, the piglets were placed in a supine position on a heating pad, and the depth of 
anesthesia was confirmed before performing a tracheotomy using a 3.5-mm endotracheal 
tube. Pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation (Sechrist Millennium® neonatal/infant 
ventilator, Anaheim, CA) was established using the following settings: fraction of inspired 
oxygen 0.21, peak inspiratory pressure 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 
cmH2O, respiratory rate 20 rpm, and inspiratory time 0.6 s. The femoral vein was 
catheterized for fluid and medication administration. Induction and maintenance of general 
anesthesia were achieved via intravenous (IV) α-chloralose, 50 mg/kg loading dose, 
followed by 20 mg/kg intermittent boluses. Arterial blood gas, pH, and hematocrit were 
monitored periodically throughout the experiment with a GEM Premier 3000 Blood Gas 
Analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA). Ventilator settings were adjusted 
to maintain PCO2, PO2, and pH at physiological ~30 mm Hg, >85 mm Hg, and 7.4, 
respectively. Animals were monitored repeatedly during experiments for anesthesia depth 
and redosed as needed. Urine was drained via a ureteral catheter.
Renal and systemic hemodynamics measurement
Cardiac output was measured noninvasively using electrical velocimetry (Aesculon 
Electrical Velocimetry, Osypka Medical GmbH) (30). Mean arterial pressure was measured 
via 3.5 Fr intra-arterial pressure catheters inserted in the right femoral artery (Mikro-Tip 
SPR-524, Millar Instruments, Inc, Houston, TX) connected to a physiological pressure 
transducer (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Piglets were then placed in the right 
lateral semirecumbent position to measure renal hemodynamics. The left kidney was 
exposed retroperitoneally through flank incisions to permit access and dissect the renal 
pedicle. Renal blood flow was measured using a transit-time ultrasound perivascular flow 
probe (Transonic 2 mm PS, Ithaca, NY) placed around the main renal artery and connected 
to a flowmeter (Transonic Systems). Local cortical (coPf) and medullary (mePf) perfusion 
were recorded using laser Doppler flowmetry (Periflux 5000, Perimed Inc). In addition, a 
fiber-optic probe (OxyLite Pro, Oxford Optronix) was advanced to measure medullary tissue

oxygen partial pressure (mtPO2). All recordings were acquired simultaneously using the 
PowerLab data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) and LabChart 
Pro software. Baseline (0 h) hemodynamics were obtained once all monitoring devices were 
in place, and data was recorded continuously throughout the experiment.
Polymicrobial sepsis induction
Sepsis was induced in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated neonatal pigs with the CLP 
technique. A left paramedian incision was performed to identify and expose the cecum and 
terminal ileum. The cecum was ligated distal to the ileocecal junction and punctured 7 times 
using an 18-gauge needle. Fecal matter was then extruded from the punctured cecum into 
the peritoneum. The cecum was returned to the abdominal cavity, which was sutured in 
layers, starting with the peritoneum. For sham-operated piglets, the abdominal wall was 
closed after identifying the cecum without any further manipulation. A detailed description 
of the surgical procedure has been published in our prior study (31). The newborn pigs 
were maintained under anesthesia and mechanical ventilation for 12 h after the surgical 
procedure.
Resuscitation protocol
All piglets were given maintenance IV fluid using lactate Ringer at 4 mL/kg/h. Resuscitation 
was initiated at 4 h after CLP in the CLP-resuscitated group. An IV fluid bolus of up to 60 
mL/kg was given, followed by NE continuous IV infusion initiated at 0.05 ug/kg/min and 
titrated up to 0.8 ug/kg/min. The goal of the resuscitation protocol was to maintain MAP 
within 15 mmHg from baseline.
Sample collection
Twelve hours after CLP, blood was collected from the femoral artery catheter into heparin 
tubes. The tubes were subsequently centrifuged, and plasma was collected and frozen for 
analysis. Urine samples were centrifuged and analyzed or stored frozen. Newborn pigs were 
euthanized with 0.2 mL/kg Euthasol (20% sodium pentobarbital and phenytoin sodium). 
The kidneys were harvested, sectioned transversely, and stored in 4% buffered formalin for 
histopathological analysis or frozen in a freezer (−80°C).
Kidney injury and inflammation assay
Kidney function in the newborn pigs was evaluated by measuring GFR, plasma creatinine 
concentration, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry was used to determine creatinine concentrations at the UAB/UCSD O’Brien 
Core Center for AKI Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Blood urea 
nitrogen level was measured using a colorimetric detection kit K024-H1 (Arbor Assays, 
Ann Arbor, MI). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was measured in the 
plasma using the pig NGAL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioPorto 
Diagnostics, Hellerup Denmark). Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined using 
an ELISA kit (Eagle Biosciences, Amherst, NH). Multiple proinflammatory cytokines were 
simultaneously measured in plasma with multiplex technology using the Luminex MAGPIX 
system (DiaSorin Inc, Saluggia, Italy). The porcine multiplex kit was purchased from

Millipore Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Liver injury was evaluated by measuring plasma alanine 
transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
which were determined using the DiaSys Respons910VET Chemistry System analyzer 
(Holzheim, Germany).
GFR determination
The three-compartment method with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated sinistrin 
clearance was used to determine GFR, as we previously described and validated in piglets 
(31). The method is based on the clearance of FITC-sinistrin as assessed by a fluorescence 
detector. Briefly, while the animals were under anesthesia, a predetermined region on the 
flank was shaved and cleaned. The optical transdermal GFR device (MediBeacon GmbH, 
Mannheim, Germany) was prepared, and once the battery was connected, the device was 
attached with an adhesive patch to the skin surface of the piglet. After 3–5 min of steady 
background reading, FITC-sinistrin solution (50 mg/mL) was administered intravenously in 
a smooth and rapid bolus at 20 mg/Kg b. wt. The device recorded FITC-sinistrin clearance 
for 4 h. The device was then removed, and the data were analyzed with the MediBeacon 
Studio 3 software following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Histopathology
Histopathological analysis was independently performed by Probetex (San Antonio, TX). 
Kidney samples were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated in graded alcohols, 
and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned for hematoxylin and eosin 
staining and examined by a pathologist at Probetex in a blinded manner. Piglets subjected to 
CLP showed minimal tubular injury in the form of coagulative necrosis, casts, or dilatation. 
Thus, the slides were only graded for tubular necrosis using a scale of 0–5 where 0 = 
normal, 1 = minimal affecting 1 to 10% of cortex, 2 = mild and multifocal affecting 11 
to 25% of cortex, 3 = moderate and multifocal affecting 26 to 50% of cortex, 4 = marked 
affecting 51 to 75% of cortex, and 5 = severe and diffuse affecting greater than 75% of 
cortex.
Immunofluorescence
Kidney slices were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for about 20 min, followed by washing with 
phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for about 15 min. The 
samples were incubated in 2% BSA to block nonspecific binding sites and treated overnight 
at 4°C with an NLRP3 primary antibody at 1:100 dilution. The next day, the samples were 
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the CF555 anti-goat secondary 
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following wash and mount, images were acquired 
using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis and graphs were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad V 
10.0, Sacramento, CA). Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and box and 
whiskers plot (min to max). Renal hemodynamic variables were adjusted for kidney weight, 
and renal vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated as the MAP to RBF/kidney wt ratio. 
Analysis of variance (ANOV A) followed by Holm-Sidak’s post hoc test was used. Statistical 
significance was set at P value <0.05.
RESULTS
Early fluid plus NE resuscitation maintained systemic and renal hemodynamics in septic 
newborn pigs
Sepsis in newborn pigs developed as a hypodynamic disease state with dysregulated renal 
macro- and microcirculation. Compared to baseline values, MAP and COP decreased by 
more than 60% (Fig. 1) in the CLP nonresuscitated group. The resuscitation protocol 
prevented a MAP drop beyond 15 mmHg from baseline (Fig. 1A). It attenuated the decline 
in COP (Fig. 1B). In contrast to sham, renal vascular resistance proportionally increased in 
nonresuscitated sepsis, whereas RBF, coPf, mePf, and mtPO2 progressively declined (Fig. 
2). Resuscitation palliated sepsis-induced reduction in regional kidney perfusion but failed to 
mitigate the decrease in medullary oxygenation (Fig. 2).
Early fluid plus NE resuscitation mitigated sepsis-induced AKI in newborn pigs
To examine the hypothesis that sepsis impairs kidney function in newborn pigs, we 
measured GFR, plasma creatinine, and BUN levels in the pigs. Transdermal measurement of 
FITC-sinistrin kinetics showed delayed clearance in CLP nonresuscitated piglets compared 
to sham animals. The increased FITC-sinistrin half-life translated into a reduction in GFR 
of more than 70% in the CLP nonresuscitated group, whereas the sepsis-induced decline in 
GFR was attenuated in the CLP resuscitated piglets (Fig. 3A). Kidney injury was further 
confirmed in CLP nonresuscitated animals by the increase in plasma creatinine, BUN, 
and NGAL (an early marker of AKI), compared to sham (Fig. 3, B–D). The levels of 
these AKI biomarkers were decreased in CLP resuscitated piglets compared to the CLP 
nonresuscitated group (Fig. 3, B–D). Sepsis also resulted in isolated foci of renal tubular 
necrosis. Resuscitation significantly mitigated the sepsis-induced renal morphological injury 
(Fig. 4).
Early fluid plus NE resuscitation reduced sepsis-induced increases in plasma C-reactive 
protein and renal NLRP3 inflammasome in newborn pigs
Cecal ligation and puncture raised plasma CRP levels in the newborn pigs, which 
were significantly counteracted by fluid plus NE resuscitation (Fig. 5A). Fluorescence 
immunostaining revealed increased NLRP3 inflammasome levels in the kidneys of CLP 
nonresuscitated pigs, compared to both sham and CLP resuscitated animals (Fig. 5, B and 
C).

Early fluid plus NE resuscitation attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, 
tissue, and liver injury in septic newborn pigs
Proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18] and tissue 
(LDH) and liver (ALT and AST) injury biomarkers were significantly elevated in the septic 
newborn pigs compared to sham, effects attenuated by resuscitation (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the impact of early fluid plus NE resuscitation on systemic and renal 
hemodynamics in newborn pigs with septic-AKI secondary to CLP. Our findings suggest 
that 1) the newborn pig develops hypodynamic sepsis secondary to CLP, characterized 
by a progressive decline in MAP, COP, RBF, coPf, mePf, and mtPO2; 2) CLP induces 
AKI characterized by a reduction in GFR, elevated biomarkers, and changes in kidney 
morphology; 3) fluid bolus plus NE resuscitation ameliorated the hypodynamic shock 
caused by sepsis, diminishes proinflammatory cytokines production and liver injury; and 
4) although resuscitation restored renal perfusion, it did not affect the reduction in renal 
medullary tissue oxygenation.
Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that the hemodynamic response 
of newborns to sepsis differs from that of adults. Septic adults develop a biphasic 
hemodynamic reaction characterized by an early hyperdynamic stage followed by a 
late hypodynamic stage (17,32). In contrast, neonates are more likely to develop a 
hypodynamic response from the onset of septic disease (17). Here, CLP in 3–7-day-old 
piglets induced sepsis with hypodynamic circulation throughout the 12 h of monitoring. 
Cardiac output, MAP, and RBF decreased, while renal vascular resistance increased. 
Because of the immaturity of the cardiac and autoregulatory mechanisms, newborns are 
inherently predisposed to reduced COP and higher vascular resistance (13,14,17). The 
hemodynamic findings from experimental studies are heterogeneous and highlight that age 
and species of animal models are determining factors in the translational approach of septic 
AKI. Various large animal models have closely mimicked the early human adult sepsis 
phenotype. Escherichia coli (E. coli) infusion to conscious sheep caused sepsis associated 
with hyperdynamic circulation, with preserved or increased RBF and decreased vascular 
resistance (33). Chvojka et al. (34) and Brandt et al. (35) observed increased COP and 
decreased systemic vascular resistance in fecal peritonitis-induced sepsis in the swine model. 
In pediatric animal models, like our data, newborn piglets subjected to lipopolysaccharide 
infusion developed hypotension and decreased cardiac index (36,37). In the comparative 
study by Seely et al. (38), the pediatric rat model of CLP-induced septic AKI showed 
significantly greater and faster hemodynamic deterioration than adult rats subjected to the 
same procedure. Although with a more moderate course, MAP and RBF also decreased 
in the adult rats, suggesting that adult rodents may be prone to hypodynamic sepsis when 
subjected to CLP (38,39).
In neonatal sepsis, CRP has been used as a diagnostic biomarker, although its increase 
is often not seen until 12 to 24 h after the start of infection (40,41). Our previous work 
demonstrated that plasma CRP levels were elevated significantly as early as 6 h after 
CLP in neonatal pigs, confirming the presence of sepsis (29). In this study, at 6 h, CLP-

induced decline in MAP, COP, and total RBF were significant, as opposed to changes 
in cortical and medullary perfusion and medullary oxygen tension. Our data show that 
macrocirculatory changes at 6 h have not yet substantially impacted renal microcirculation 
in this experimental model. However, 12 h after CLP, significant cortical and medullary 
hypoperfusion and hypoxia occurred. These events were concurrent with an impairment of 
kidney function in the CLP group, characterized by decreased GFR and increased plasma 
creatinine, BUN, and NGAL levels.
The reduction of cortical and medullary perfusion following the decline in systemic 
hemodynamics and RBF observed in the septic newborn pigs has been described in 
previous animal models of hypodynamic sepsis (38,39,42). With lower renal blood flow 
than adults and immature peripheral vasoregulation, neonates are more predisposed to 
kidney injury associated with changes in renal perfusion (13,14). The decrease in GFR 
in this study may arise from vasoconstriction caused by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
and sympathetic nervous system activation in response to sepsis-associated hypoperfusion 
and hypovolemia (43–46). Constriction of the arterioles and the vasa recta may further 
enhance renal microcirculatory hypoperfusion and hypoxia (44), which may initiate a 
vicious cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation that ultimately culminates in AKI 
(10,20,22,43). Because AKI also develops in hyperdynamic models of sepsis with increased 
RBF (34,47), there may be underlying mechanisms other than renal hypoperfusion that 
contribute to the development of neonatal septic AKI (20,42). The pathophysiology of 
newborn septic AKI likely revolves around a complex interplay between hemodynamic 
and immunologic factors. Increased renal NLRP3 inflammasome expression evidenced an 
inflammatory process in the kidneys of septic newborn pigs. This finding is corroborated 
by human kidney biopsies studies (48) and rat septic models (49), where upregulation of 
NLRP3 inflammasome expression corresponds to renal inflammation and multiorgan injury. 
Suppressing NLPR3 inflammasome expression improved renal function, reduced renal 
inflammation, and prevented multiorgan damage (48–50). Various sepsis-related factors 
associated with NLRP3 inflammasome in septic newborn pigs may include pathogen-
associated and damage-associated molecular patterns (10,51).
The hallmark of septic AKI histopathology was formerly considered acute tubular necrosis 
(ATN) (52). However, the systematic review by Kosaka et al. (53) challenged this conjecture 
by revealing that in experimental septic AKI, ATN was uncommon and typically seen in 
low COP models. Histopathology in hyperdynamic models is characterized by nonspecific 
changes rather than ATN (34), consistent with findings in adult human postmortem tissue, 
where almost normal appearance or minor renal morphological changes were reported (54–
56). Renal hypoperfusion associated with hypodynamic septic AKI has been described as 
the potential cause of ATN (53). While CLP in our model caused decreased COP and RBF, 
kidney morphological changes were minor. Of note, histopathological data on experimental 
newborn sepsis is scarce, and the findings described in human studies are from kidneys of 
adult deceased septic patients (55,56). It is uncertain whether the observed minor changes 
correspond entirely with histopathological features of human newborn septic AKI or are due 
to the 12-h duration of sepsis.

Resuscitation of the septic group followed current guidelines for managing sepsis in 
pediatric patients (23). Given that resuscitation with crystalloid fluids containing high 
chloride concentrations has been associated with a higher incidence of AKI (23,57), a 
balanced lactate Ringer was chosen over 0.9% saline. Fluid resuscitation followed by 
NE infusion successfully maintained MAP and COP within the established threshold. 
Norepinephrine increases MAP via α-adrenergic receptors, whereas the rise in COP 
occurs because of increased stroke volume via NE’s modest β-adrenergic agonist effect 
(25). Fluid bolus plus NE resuscitation also attenuated the systemic proinflammatory 
cytokine production triggered by CLP, which may underlie the protection against AKI. 
Stolk et al. (58) observed that in both mice and humans, NE diminished proinflammatory 
cytokine release and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine production in response to 
lipopolysaccharide challenge. Immune cells possess β-adrenergic receptors, and the 
underlying mechanisms of anti-inflammatory activity of NE may include β-adrenergic 
stimulation and suppression of immunometabolism (58,59).
Furthermore, our data suggest liver injury in the septic newborn pigs, which was alleviated 
by fluid and NE resuscitation. Although intraportal NE infusion altered hepatocellular 
function in septic adult rats (60), vasopressor intervention in septic pigs protected against 
liver injury (61,62). A combination of species, age, or dosage may underlie the variability 
of liver responses to fluid and vasopressor intervention in sepsis. Additional studies are 
necessary to provide more insights into the mitigation of neonatal acute liver failure by early 
fluid and NE resuscitation.
Clinical and experimental data have shown that the timing of vasopressors may determine 
the response to resuscitation during sepsis treatment (24,63). The prospective study by 
Ospina-Tascon et al. (63) in adult patients with septic shock revealed that an early 
start of NE might benefit clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of fluid overload and 
shortening the time of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. However, this vasopressor can also 
harm those patients who develop catecholamine-resistant septic shock if NE resuscitation 
is not discontinued (26). In cases of refractory hypotension, combined therapy using 
NE as the primary vasopressor alongside adjunctive terlipressin has been shown to 
effectively reduce the dosage of NE leading to improved clinical outcomes (64). Regarding 
sepsis-induced AKI, there is no consensus on the effect of NE on kidney function and 
microcirculation. Hyperdynamic models of sepsis have shown that in response to vasoactive 
drugs in sepsis, the microcirculation is dissociated from macrocirculatory changes, often 
resulting in exacerbated medullary hypoperfusion and hypoxia (33,34). This may again 
be a time-dependent phenomenon, as Giantomasso et al. (65) reported a favorable renal 
microcirculatory response to NE infusion in a model of early hyperdynamic sepsis in 
adult sheep. Norepinephrine improved systemic hemodynamics and urine output in preterm 
infants with sepsis (66). Here, we demonstrate that restoration of MAP and RBF in the 
early stages of sepsis was followed by recovery of cortical and medullary perfusion and a 
subsequent increase in GFR.
Noteworthy is that resuscitation failed to palliate the renal medullary hypoxia induced 
by CLP in the piglets in this study. The decrease in renal tissue oxygenation may result 
from an imbalance between local oxygen delivery and consumption (20). Oxygen delivery

is determined by the distribution of the renal blood flow to the cortical and medullary 
circulations (20). The renal medulla is more prone to hypoxia, congestion, and injury when 
renal blood flow is impaired during sepsis (20,42,43). The medullary vascular topography 
and the tubules’ high oxygen demand render medullary tissue oxygen tension lower than 
the cortex’s, even under healthy conditions (42,43). Moreover, diffusive and convective 
arteriovenous oxygen shunting may occur and enhance localized tissue hypoxia, with a 
greater impact on the medulla (20,22). On the other hand, oxygen consumption in the 
renal tissue is dominated by the energy required to drive tubular sodium reabsorption (20). 
Therefore, an increase in GFR and, thus, of sodium filtration during resuscitation may have 
increased oxygen consumption, promoting medullary hypoxia despite the recovery of renal 
medullary blood flow. Our findings contradict the study demonstrating that NE intervention 
in E. coli-induced sepsis in sheep restored blood pressure and preserved cortical perfusion 
and oxygenation but further aggravated medullary hypoperfusion and hypoxia (33). The 
apparent disparities in the results obtained from the study conducted by Lankadeva et al. 
(33) and our present study may arise from variations in species, age, or the sepsis model 
utilized.
The feasibility of measuring renal hemodynamics and obtaining kidney biopsies in critically 
ill infants is extremely limited. Therefore, the study of sepsis-induced AKI in newborns is 
challenging, and most of the understanding of this disease is primarily based on preclinical 
data (67). Because of its size and anatomical and physiological characteristics, the pig is 
an ideal model for studying neonatal disease, which has gained further interest given the 
advancement in xenotransplantation (68,69). Modeling newborn sepsis in the piglet provided 
the ability to evaluate hemodynamic parameters continuously in real-time throughout the 12 
h of the study.
The CLP model induces polymicrobial sepsis in the experimental setting, which closely 
mimics the clinical features of human sepsis and, to some extent, resembles necrotizing 
enterocolitis occurring in neonates (67,69). As opposed to single-pathogen sepsis models, 
the polymicrobial challenge is considered the gold standard for neonatal sepsis because 
it mirrors the timeline progression of human sepsis more similarly (69). Following the 
“Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies (MQTiPSS)” consensus (70), 
there are a few limitations in this study. This study focuses on the early phase of neonatal 
sepsis, encompassing only the first 12 h of an illness with a progression from days to weeks. 
Even though antimicrobial therapy comprises first-line treatment of septic neonates (23), it 
was excluded from this protocol so that changes generated solely by fluid bolus and NE 
resuscitation could be examined. Piglets in the study were subjected to general anesthesia, 
which may alter hemodynamics and promote reduced renal perfusion and oxygenation 
(42). Nevertheless, sedation and mechanical ventilation are standard-of-care treatments for 
critically ill septic neonates.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, early sepsis in newborn pigs is associated with hypodynamic circulation 
and reduced renal blood flow. Early implementation of resuscitation to maintain blood 
pressure, COP, and kidney perfusion lessens the degree of inflammation, AKI, and liver

injury in the pigs. The discrepancy between medullary perfusion and oxygenation indicates 
that optimizing perfusion and blood flow may not correlate with improved medullary 
oxygen delivery in newborns. Further studies are necessary to investigate the outcome 
of resuscitation in the later stages of neonatal sepsis and the performance of additional 
management strategies addressing medullary hypoxia.
