ABSTRACT Bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms against phages. 
Abortive infection (Abi), a bacterial defense mechanism, can be achieved through 
various means, including toxin-antitoxin systems, cyclic oligonucleotide-based 
antiphage signaling systems, and retrons. AbpA and AbpB (AbpAB) defend against 
many lytic phages harboring double-stranded DNA genomes in Escherichia coli; however, 
how AbpAB senses phage infection and inhibits its propagation remains unclear. Here, 
we demonstrated that AbpAB inhibited the growth of the φX174 lytic phage with 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as the lysogenization and induction of the Sakai 
prophage 5 lysogenic phage. The AbpAB defense system limits T4 and φX174 phage 
propagation via Abi. AbpA contains a nuclease domain at its N-terminus, and AbpB has 
an ATP-dependent RNA helicase domain; both domains are required for phage defense. 
This system is activated by phage Gp32 binding to ssDNA and inhibits E. coli  growth. 
Without phage infection, DNA replication inhibitors or defects in the DNA repair factors 
RecB and RecC activate this system. Therefore, the E. coli  AbpAB defense system may 
sense DNA-protein complexes, including the phage-encoded ssDNA-binding protein or 
those formed by interrupting host DNA replication or repair.
IMPORTANCE Although numerous phage defense systems have recently been 
discovered in bacteria, how these systems defend against phage propagation or sense 
phage infections remains unclear. The Escherichia coli  AbpAB defense system targets 
several lytic and lysogenic phages harboring DNA genomes. A phage-encoded single-
stranded DNA-binding protein, Gp32, activates this system similar to other phage 
defense systems such as Retron-Eco8, Hachiman, ShosTA, Nhi, and Hna. DNA replication 
inhibitors or defects in DNA repair factors activate the AbpAB system, even without 
phage infection. This is one of the few examples of activating phage defense systems 
without phage infection or proteins. The AbpAB defense system may be activated by 
sensing specific DNA-protein complexes.

acteria have developed various defense mechanisms against phages for their 
survival and propagation. Bacteria prevent phage adsorption by altering or 
concealing phage receptors, inhibit phage propagation by cleaving phage nucleic acids 
through restriction-modification and the CRISPR-Cas system, or commit suicide before 
phage progeny is produced ( 1, 2). The defense mechanism involving suicide is termed 
abortive infection (Abi). As Abi leads to the premature death of a phage-infected cell 
before the phage completes its lifecycle, few phage progenies propagate, protecting 
the surrounding clonal bacteria from phage infections. Abi can be achieved through 
toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems

(CBASS), and retrons ( 1, 3–6). In TA-mediated Abi, phage infection triggers antitoxin 
loss or liberates toxins from the toxin-antitoxin complexes, resulting in toxin-medi­
ated arrests of bacterial growth by inhibiting essential cellular processes, consequently 
inhibiting phage propagation ( 4, 7). In CBASS-mediated Abi, phage infection activates 
a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase), generating cyclic oligonucleoti­
des. These second messengers bind and activate various effector proteins, includ­
ing phospholipase, endonuclease, and peptidase, causing bacterial cell death ( 5, 8). 
Retron-Eco48 and -Se72 are activated by inhibiting bacterial RecBCD after phage 
infection, causing cell growth arrest via unknown mechanisms (6, 9).
Recently, phage components that induce Abi by activating defense systems have 
been identified. Upon binding of the phage capsid protein Gp57 to CapRel, a member of 
the toxSAS TA family, the N-terminal toxin of CapRel is released from the C-terminal 
antitoxin, becoming activated ( 7, 10). Similarly, diverse phages evade Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa CBASS via mutations in their major capsid protein, suggesting that the 
capsid protein triggers CBASS activation ( 11). The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding 
protein (SSB) of the phage, which is critical for DNA replication, activates several defense 
systems, including the helicase/nuclease Hna proteins from Sinorhizobium meliloti  and 
Escherichia coli , Retron-Eco8 from E. coli , and nuclease-helicase immunity (Nhi) from 
Staphylococcus epidermidis  (9, 12, 13). Furthermore, the components of the phage core 
replication machinery, such as primase, DNA helicase, and DNA polymerase, activate 
many antiphage systems, including AbiQ, DarTG, Borvo, Lamassu, ietAS, and AbpAB ( 9). 
Although novel phage components that induce Abi have been identified, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the activation of phage defense systems by these components 
remain unclear.
The abpA and abpB genes in the E. coli K-12 genome form an operon, and the coding 
regions of both genes overlap by four nucleotides ( Fig. 1A ). AbpA and AbpB (AbpAB) 
coexpression suppresses the growth of many lytic phages harboring double-stranded 
DNA (dsDNA) genomes ( 14). AbpA and AbpB physically interact for phage defense. 
AbpAB is activated after the middle stage of infection and inhibits DNA replication in T2, 
T4, and T7 phages. However, the T4 phage can evade the AbpAB defense system through 
a mutation in gene 41, which encodes a replicative DNA helicase ( 14, 15). However, the 
function of Gp41 in this system, the AbpAB activation mechanism after phage infection, 
and how AbpAB inhibits phage propagation remain unclear.
In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of AbpAB on the growth of lytic phages 
harboring ssDNA or RNA as a genome and a lysogenic phage and to identify the AbpA 
and AbpB domains required for phage defense. This study also aimed to determine 
whether phage DNA replicative components trigger the AbpAB defense system activa­
tion. Finally, we aimed to identify new conditions under which the AbpAB system is 
activated without phage infection.
RESULTS
AbpAB defends against many phages with DNA genomes
We assessed the impact of AbpAB on the growth of lytic phages containing ssDNA or 
RNA, specifically φX174 or Q β phages. Both phages grew in cells harboring the empty 
plasmid pBR322 ( Fig. 1B ). Q β grew normally in cells harboring the pST4-1 plasmid 
expressing AbpA and AbpB; however, the efficiency of plating (EOP) of φX174 decreased 
to <10−4, indicating that AbpAB inhibits φX174 growth. We also examined whether the 
AbpAB defense system induces Abi. Cells harboring pBR322 or pST4-1 were infected with 
T4 or φX174 phages at a low or high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells harboring 
pBR322 grew slowly until approximately 6 h post-T4 infection and underwent cell lysis at 
a low MOI, whereas cells harboring pST4-1 exhibited normal growth ( Fig. 1C ). Similar 
growth curves after infection at a low MOI were observed for φX174. T4 or φX174 
infection at a high MOI caused immediate growth arrest and lysis in cells harboring 
pBR322 or pST4-1; however, the collapse of cells harboring pST4-1 after T4 infection 
occurred slightly earlier than the phage-induced lysis in cells harboring pBR322.

Therefore, AbpAB defends against T4 and likely φX174 via Abi rather than a direct phage 
interference, such as restriction-modification or CRISPR-Cas (9).
We then investigated the effects of AbpAB on lysogenization and induction of 
lysogenic phages. The lambdoid Sp5 (Sakai prophage 5), a prophage of the enterohe­
morrhagic E. coli  O157:H7 Sakai strain, can infect non-pathogenic E. coli  K-12 strains 
(16). We first assessed the lysogenization rates of the Sp5 phage in cells expressing 
AbpAB, AbpA, or AbpB ( Fig. 1D). E. coli K-12 TY0807 cells harboring each plasmid were 
infected with an equal number of Sp5 phages containing a kanamycin (KM)-resistance 
gene. Lysogenizing the Sp5 phage transformed TY0807 cells into KM-resistant cells. 
Lysogenization in cells harboring pBR322 was 1.3%, whereas that in cells with pST4-1 
was considerably reduced to 0.017%. No reduction in the lysogenization rate in cells 
with pST4-11 expressing AbpB or pST4-12 expressing AbpA was observed. These results 
indicate that AbpA and AbpB coexpression inhibited Sp5 phage lysogenization.
We then examined the effect of AbpAB on Sp5 prophage induction. The Sp5 
prophage was induced in MG1655-Sp5 (km r) cells harboring pBR322 or pST4-1 using 
mitomycin C (MMC), a DNA-damaging agent that crosslinks two DNA bases and triggers 
prophage induction ( 17). The number of Sp5 phage progeny released from cells was 
then measured using a plaque-forming assay ( Fig. 1E). Compared to the phage progeny 
from cells harboring pBR322, the number of phage progeny from cells harboring pST4-1 
at 4, 6, and 8 h after MMC addition was reduced to <1% of the control, indicating that 
AbpAB inhibits Sp5 prophage induction. Therefore, AbpAB defends against many lytic 
phages with DNA genomes and lysogenic phages.
Nuclease domain at the AbpA N-terminus is required for phage defense
AbpA encodes a 538-amino acid (aa)-long protein and contains two predicted Pfam 
domains—the CD-NTase-associated protein 4 (Cap4) dsDNA endonuclease (PF14130; aa 
5-215) and HamA (PF08878; aa 294–519). Cap4 contains an N-terminal effector domain 
with dsDNA nuclease activity and a C-terminal SAVED domain to sense secondary 
nucleotide messengers synthesized after phage infection, functioning in the cyclic 
oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) ( 18). The Cap4 endonu­
clease domain shares structural homology with type II restriction endonucleases. HamA 
is an uncharacterized protein that participates in the Hachiman antiphage system with 
HamB (19, 20). We obtained the AlphaFold2 model of AbpA from the AlphaFold Protein 
Structure Database ( Fig. 2A) and searched for proteins similar to the AbpA model. The 
N-terminal region of AbpA showed high structural similarity to the dsDNA endonuclease 
domain of Cap4 ( Fig. 2B). Cap4 endonuclease activity requires Asp50, Glu67, and Lys69, 
which coordinate with divalent metal ions ( 18). In AbpA, the Asp45, Gln58, and Lys60 
residues occupy the equivalent steric position as the three amino acids required for Cap4 
endonuclease activity ( Fig. 2C). We constructed two plasmids expressing AbpA mutants 
wherein Gln58 or Lys60 was substituted with alanine to clarify whether these amino 
acids are required for the AbpAB defense system. AbpB and AbpA (Q58A) or AbpA (K60A) 
coexpression allowed normal T4 phage growth ( Fig. 2D), indicating the significance of 
both amino acids in phage defense. This finding suggests that the DNA endonuclease 
activity of AbpA is essential in the defense system.

ATP-dependent RNA helicase domain of AbpB is required for phage defense
AbpB encodes a 729-aa-long protein and contains a helicase-conserved C-terminal 
domain (PF00271; aa 364–433). We obtained the AbpB AlphaFold2 model ( Fig. 3A) and 
identified several ATP-dependent RNA helicases showing high structural similarity with 
Z-scores > 20. Human RNA helicase Ddp5 (DDX19B) structure ( Fig. 3B ) ( 21) exhibited 
high similarity to the middle domain structure of AbpB ( Fig. 3C ). DDX19B belongs to 
the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase family, which unwinds RNA duplexes or 
displaces bound protein complexes in an ATP-dependent manner ( 22). Lys128, Asp208, 
and Glu209 in AbpB occupy the equivalent steric position to the amino acids (Lys144, 
Asp242, and Glu243) required for ATP binding to DDX19B ( Fig. 3D ). We constructed 
plasmids expressing AbpB mutants wherein these amino acid residues were substituted 
with alanine. Coexpression of AbpA and each AbpB mutant did not inhibit T4 phage 
growth ( Fig. 3E ), confirming that these amino acids are essential for phage defense. 
These results suggest that the AbpB helicase activity is vital for bacterial defense.
AbpAB defense system is activated by phage-encoded proteins bound to 
ssDNA
The T4 phage can evade the AbpAB defense system through a mutation in gene 
41, which encodes a replicative DNA helicase, indicating the need for Gp41 ( 14). We 
constructed the plasmid pBAD33-Gp41, which contained gene 41 under an arabinose-
inducible promoter, to investigate whether Gp41 could activate the AbpAB system and 
induce cell growth arrest. Unexpectedly, cells harboring pST4-1 and pBAD33-gp41 grew 
normally after L-arabinose (L-ara) addition ( Fig. 4A), indicating that Gp41 is not sufficient 
to activate this system.
Coexpressing several phage defense systems with phage SSB inhibits bacterial cell 
growth ( 9, 12). Therefore, we investigated whether the T4 phage SSB, Gp32, could 
induce cell growth arrest in the presence of the AbpAB defense system. Whereas Gp32 
expression in cells harboring pBR322 had no impact on cell growth, cells harboring 
pST4-1 exhibited immediate growth retardation upon Gp32 expression ( Fig. 4B ). We 
examined the growth of a T4-mutant phage (tsP7) with a missense mutation in gene 
32 to validate this further ( 23). Wild-type phages did not grow on cells carrying pST4-1; 
however, tsP7 phages showed growth on these cells comparable to that on cells carrying 
pBR322 ( Fig. 4C ). These results indicated that Gp32 activated this system to inhibit 
cell growth. The effect of Gp32 on the AbpAB defense system depended on AbpA 
and AbpB coexpression ( Fig. S1A). Subsequently, we examined whether activating this 
system through Gp32 requires the ability of Gp32 to bind ssDNA. Gp32 binds to ssDNA 
through its Zn-finger domain, a DNA-binding motif ( 24). The Cys77, Cys87, Cys90, and 
His64 residues in the Zn-finger are required for ssDNA binding. We constructed a plasmid 
expressing a Gp32 mutant wherein Cys87 and Cys90 residues were substituted with 
alanines. Coexpressing the Gp32 mutant with AbpAB did not retard cell growth ( Fig. 4B), 
suggesting that activating this system requires Gp32 binding to ssDNA.
We previously investigated phages capable of evading this system and identified 
T4-like phages RB32 and RB69. RB32 and RB69 could grow in cells expressing AbpAB, 
whereas RB49 could not ( Fig. 4D). However, the plaque sizes of RB32 and RB69 became 
smaller by expressing AbpAB, indicating that the AbpAB system was slightly active. To 
support this, coexpressing Gp32 from RB32 or RB69 with AbpAB induced cell growth 
retardation (Fig. 4E). These results strongly suggest that both phages possess factors that 
inhibit the AbpAB system once it is activated post-infection.
AbpAB is activated by interrupting host DNA replication or repair without 
phage infection
We sought to identify conditions under which the AbpAB defense system becomes 
active without phage infection. AbpAB does not affect E. coli  growth under normal 
growth conditions ( 14) ( Fig. 5A ). When MMC was added to cells harboring pBR322

or pST4-1 at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the cells harboring pBR322 continued to 
grow although minor growth inhibition was observed ( Fig. 5A ). Conversely, cells with 
pST4-1 exhibited substantial growth retardation. The number of colony-forming units 
(CFU) indicated that the viable cell count with pST4-1 was reduced to <1% after 2 and 4 h 
of MMC addition when compared to that before MMC addition ( Fig. 5B). These results 
suggest that MMC activates the AbpAB defense system and induces cell growth arrest 
and death. Subsequently, we explored whether other DNA replication inhibitors could 
activate this system. When we added norfloxacin (NFLX), a DNA gyrase inhibitor, or 
bleomycin (BLM), which cleaves DNA, cells with pST4-1 exhibited noticeable growth 
retardation, similar to the effect of MMC treatment ( Fig. 5C). However, when we added 
hydroxyurea, 5-azacytidine, and streptomycin, which inhibit deoxyribonucleotide 
biosynthesis, cytosine DNA methylation, and translation, respectively, no growth 
retardation occurred ( Fig. S2). These results suggest that the interruption of replication 
that occurs on host DNA activates the AbpAB defense system.
DNA replication inhibitors such as MMC and BLM induce SOS responses. ssDNA and 
E. coli  SSB production increases during the SOS response ( 25). Therefore, we examined 
whether E. coli SSB inhibited the growth of AbpAB-expressing cells, as did T4 Gp32. E. coli 
SSB and AbpAB coexpression did not exhibit growth retardation ( Fig. S1B). In addition, 
we examined whether RecA and LexA, two vital factors in the SOS response, contribute 
to MMC-induced AbpAB defense system activation. When MMC was added to ∆recA or 
∆lexA cells harboring pBR322, the optical density at 660 nm (OD 660) value corresponding 
to the steady state was lower than that of cells without MMC ( Fig. 5D), possibly because 
the SOS response or DNA repair mechanisms did not work. The growth of recA or 
lexA-deleted cells with pST4-1 was retarded after MMC addition, suggesting that RecA 
and LexA are not involved in the MMC-induced activation of this system. RecB and 
RecC are proteins in the heterotrimeric helicase/nuclease complex known as RecBCD, 
which promotes homologous recombination repair in dsDNA breaks ( 26). ∆recB or ∆recC 
cells harboring pBR322 grew substantially slower than wild-type cells ( Fig. S3), possibly 
owing to their defective DNA repair capacity ( 27). Both deletion cells harboring pST4-1 
exhibited evident growth retardation after MMC addition ( Fig. 5E), indicating that RecB 
and RecC are not essential in MMC-induced AbpAB defense system activation. However, 
∆recB or ∆recC cells harboring pST4-1 grew considerably slower than did those harboring 
pBR322 without MMC ( Fig. 5E ; Fig. S3 ), indicating that AbpAB is partially activated by 
recB or recC deletion, resulting in inhibiting cell growth. These findings suggest that the 
AbpAB defense system can be triggered by interrupting host DNA replication or repair 
without phage infection.
DISCUSSION
This study investigated the activation of the AbpAB defense system and its role in 
inhibiting phage propagation. The SSB Gp32 of the T4, RB32, and RB69 phages activates 
AbpAB to inhibit cell growth, thereby inducing Abi. Retron-Eco8 is activated by the T7 
SSB or SECphi4 phages and induces cell growth inhibition ( 9). Similarly, coexpressing 
the Hachiman defense system with phage SSBs inhibits cell growth ( 9). Hna, a protein

containing helicase and nuclease domains, is also activated by phage SSB in Abi ( 12), 
and phage SSB activates the Nhi defense system ( 13). Therefore, phage SSBs are vital 
activators of many phage defense systems. Binding T4 Gp32 to ssDNA is required for the 
AbpAB defense system, indicating the importance of ssDNA as well as Gp32 in activating 
this system. In AbpAB-expressing cells, T4 early and middle proteins were synthesized 
normally, whereas late proteins were hardly synthesized ( 14). This result indicates that 
the AbpAB defense system is activated after the middle stage of T4 infection, as 
evidenced by the increase in ssDNA and Gp32 levels at the middle stage when DNA 
replication occurs. However, how Gp32 and ssDNA activate this system remains unclear. 
Gp32 primarily binds to the ssDNA produced during phage DNA replication; therefore, 
the DNA replicative protein complex containing Gp32 and possibly Gp41 could activate 
the AbpAB defense system. A proposed model suggests that Nhi is activated by the DNA 
replicative protein complex, including phage SSB, causing phage DNA degradation ( 13). 
Similarly, Hachiman and ShosTA may respond to a protein-DNA complex formed as an 
intermediate during phage DNA replication or recombination (9).
Although a missense mutation in gene 41 allowed T4 phages to evade the AbpAB 
defense system ( 14), Gp41 expression alone did not inhibit AbpAB-expressing cell 
growth, suggesting that Gp41 may activate this system through Gp32 in T4-infected 
cells. As a mutation in gene 41 encoding a DNA helicase inhibits DNA unwinding, the 
amount of ssDNA should be decreased. This decrease could reduce the ssDNA-Gp32 
complex levels, possibly preventing activating this system. T4 Gp32 shares a high 
homology of 98% with Gp32 from RB32 and 90% with Gp32 from RB69. The conserved 
Cys87 and Cys90 residues in a Zn-finger motif among these three phages indicate that 
Gp32 from RB32 or RB69 is possibly capable of binding to ssDNA and activating the 
AbpAB defense system. Notably, even though these Gp32 inhibited the growth of cells 
expressing AbpAB, RB32 and RB69 phages escaped this system and grew. Therefore, both 
phages must be equipped with factors that inhibit the AbpAB system. Identifying and 
characterizing these inhibitory factors can provide insight into regulating the AbpAB 
defense system between bacteria and phages.
We demonstrated that interrupting host DNA replication or repair activated the 
AbpAB system without phage infection. This is one of the few examples of phage 
defense system activation without phage infection or phage-related proteins. A similar 
concept was recently shown in CBASS, seemingly activated following anti-folate 
antibiotic treatment ( 28, 29). As MMC, BLM, and NFLX act directly on the host DNA, 
AbpAB possibly senses the DNA-protein complexes formed through interrupted host 
DNA replication. The SOS response factors (RecA and LexA), E. coli SSB, and DNA repair 
factors (RecB and RecC) were not involved in the MMC-induced AbpAB defense system 
activation. However, AbpAB seems to be partially activated by recB or recC deletion. The 
DNA-protein intermediate complexes formed during DNA repair accumulate in these 
repair-deficient mutants. Hence, AbpAB may be activated by sensing the presence or 
increased levels of these intermediate DNA-protein complexes.
The AbpAB system prevented the propagation of the φX174 phage with ssDNA 
genomes. This phage encodes 11 genes, 4 of which (A, A*, C, and J) encode proteins 
involved in DNA replication or binding. Proteins C and J expressed from the plasmid did 
not trigger AbpAB-mediated cell growth inhibition (S. Takita and Y. Otsuka, unpublished 
data). We have also investigated the ability of the A and A* proteins to activate the 
AbpAB system. As the Q β RNA phage encodes only four proteins, which are unlikely 
to bind to ssDNA or directly inhibit host DNA replication, AbpAB showed no defense 
activity against the Q β phage. Additionally, AbpAB inhibited the lysogenization and 
induction of the Sp5 phage; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain 
unclear. In the induction experiment, MMC was used as a DNA-damaging agent. MMC 
might have activated the AbpAB defense system and inhibited cell growth and viability, 
causing a decrease in the induced phage progenies. Another possibility is that an 
uncharacterized Sp5 SSB may activate this system. In the context of AbpAB-mediated 
inhibition of Sp5 lysogenization, cell suicide following infection may result in a lower

lysogeny rate. We examined the lytic propagation of Sp5 phages to verify this hypothesis. 
However, no significant EOP reduction by AbpAB expression was observed (Fig. S4), likely 
dismissing the abovementioned hypothesis. During lysogenization, the host genome is 
cleaved, and an integrase inserts the phage genome. The AbpAB defense system may 
then be activated, inhibiting cell growth and viability and decreasing the lysogenization 
rate.
We identified specific domains in AbpA and AbpB required for phage defense; 
however, the biochemical activities of both proteins remain unestablished. The N-
terminal region of AbpA exhibits a high structural similarity to the dsDNA endo­
nuclease domain of Cap4. As mutational analysis suggests the essentiality of DNA 
nuclease activity, AbpA could inhibit cell growth by cleaving host DNA. Similarly, many 
ATP-dependent RNA helicases exhibited high structural similarity to the AbpB model 
structure. Amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding site abolished AbpAB defense 
activity, suggesting that the AbpAB defense system requires AbpB helicase activity. While 
helicases are involved in many defense systems, such as Hachiman, Hna, and Nhi, how 
they function in the defense systems and whether they target RNA or DNA molecules 
remain unclear. Several studies have suggested a potential relationship between the 
AbpAB and the Hachiman defense system: AbpA contains the HamA domain (previously 
known as DUF1837), and phage-encoded SSB can activate the AbpAB system, similar to 
recent findings for Hachiman ( 9). However, DELTA-BLAST (BLASTp) and Clustal Omega 
analyses demonstrated that the alignments between AbpA and HamA, or AbpB and 
HamB, were possible only in very limited regions, with the proteins sharing an identity 
of approximately 16%. Additionally, AbpA possesses the Cap4 nuclease domain required 
for antiphage function, whereas HamA does not. Therefore, we speculate that the AbpAB 
system is not a direct equivalent of the Hachiman system.
Numerous recently discovered phage defense systems have shown a considerably 
larger variety and number of defense systems than initially expected. Although most 
defense factors inhibit phage propagation when expressed in multi-copy plasmids, few 
studies have been conducted to determine whether defense factors expressed from the 
genome exhibit defense effects. When AbpAB was expressed from a plasmid, the EOP 
of the T4 phage was decreased to 10 −4. However, in wild-type and abpAB-deleted cells, 
the EOP was comparable, even though AbpAB expressed from the genome reduced the 
burst size by approximately 10% ( 14). Therefore, examining the protective potential of 
various defense factors expressed from the genome against phages is crucial. As each 
defense system alone may not inhibit phage propagation, bacteria may have evolved 
various defense systems.

(14). All restriction enzymes used in this study were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, 
Japan) and Takara Bio (Shiga, Japan) for plasmid construction. pST4-1 was digested 
with SphI or SacI and self-ligated to generate pST4-11 or pST4-12. To generate pBAD24-
gp32 or pBAD24-gp41, a DNA fragment containing gene 32 or 41 was amplified via 
PCR using the genomic DNA of the T4 phage as a template, and the primers YO-899 
and YO-912 or YO-819 and YO-820, respectively. The PCR products were digested with 
EcoRI and HindIII or KpnI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding pBAD24 sites 
(34). pBAD24-gp32 or pBAD24-gp41 was then digested with BamHI and HindIII or 
BamHI and XbaI, respectively, and ligated into pBAD33 to construct pBAD33-gp32 or 
pBAD33-gp41, respectively. pBAD24-gp32(RB32) or pBAD24-gp32(RB69) was generated 
by amplifying a DNA fragment containing gene 32 via PCR using the genomic DNA 
of the RB32 or RB69 phages as a template and YO-929 and YO-930 or YO-931 and 
YO-932 as primers, respectively. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and 
PstI and ligated into the corresponding pBAD24 sites. pBAD24-gp32(RB32) or pBAD24-
gp32(RB69) was then digested with BamHI and PstI and ligated into pBAD33 to construct 
pBAD33-gp32(RB32) or pBAD33-gp32(RB69), respectively. To generate pBAD33-ssb, a 
DNA fragment containing ssb was amplified through PCR using the genomic DNA of the 
E. coli K-12 strain as a template, and the primers YO924 and YO-925, digested with SalI 
and SphI, and ligated into pBAD33. Plasmids expressing AbpA, AbpB, or Gp32 mutants 
were constructed using a KOD-Plus-mutagenesis kit (Toyobo) with pST4-1 or pBAD33-
gp32 as the template. The following primers were used for mutagenesis: YO-714 and 
YO-715 for pST4-13 (AbpA Q58A), YO-715 and YO-716 for pST4-14 (AbpA K60A), YO-902 
and YO-903 for pST4-15 (AbpB K128A), YO-904 and YO-906 for pST4-16 (AbpB D208A), 
YO-905 and YO-906 for pST4-17 (AbpB E209A), and YO-938 and YO-939 for pBAD33-gp32 
(C87A C90A). The DNA sequences of the constructed plasmids were confirmed through 
sequencing.
E. coli growth and CFU assay
E. coli cells were grown in a Luria–Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with ampicillin (AMP) 
(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), chloramphenicol (Nacalai Tesque), or both at 37°C. When 
the OD 660 reached 0.3–0.5, 0.2% L-ara (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) 
was added to express the protein from pBAD, and 1 µg/mL MMC (FUJIFILM), 0.1 µg/mL 
NFLX (Nacalai Tesque), 10 µg/mL BLM (Nacalai Tesque), 500 µg/mL hydroxyurea (Nacalai 
Tesque), 1 µg/mL 5-azacytidine (Nacalai Tesque), 2 µg/mL streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque), 
or phage T4 or φX174 was added. The cell density was monitored every 20 min using a 
biophotorecorder (TVS062CA; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). Measurements were performed 
at least in triplicate, and similar results were obtained for each measurement. In the CFU 
assays, E. coli cells were grown in the LB broth supplemented with AMP at 37°C until the 
OD660 reached 0.4 and were harvested at 0, 2, and 4 h after adding MMC. The cells were 
diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (Nacalai Tesque), plated on LB-agar plates, and

incubated at 37°C overnight. The colonies were counted, and the number of viable cells 
per 1 mL of the culture medium was calculated.
Induction of Sp5 phages
MG1655-Sp5 (km r) cells harboring pBR322 or pST4-1 were grown in an LB medium 
supplemented with KM at 37°C until the OD 660 reached approximately 0.4 and treated 
with 1.0 µg/mL MMC for 4, 6, or 8 h ( 35). Cell cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 
3 min, and the supernatant was used for a plaque-forming assay. The phage solution was 
mixed with MG1655 as an indicator cell in soft agar containing LB medium, 0.3% agar, 
1.5 µg/mL MMC, and 10 mM CaCl 2. The mixture was poured onto LB-agar plates and 
incubated at 37°C overnight before counting the plaque-forming units.
Sp5 phage lysogeny
MG1655-Sp5 (km r) cells were grown in an LB medium supplemented with KM at 37°C 
until the OD 660 reached approximately 0.4 and treated with 1.0 µg/mL MMC for 8 h. 
Cell cultures were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was used as 
the Sp5 lysate. A 100 µL aliquot of the Sp5 lysate was mixed with 1 mL TY0807 cells 
(3–5 × 108 cells) harboring pBR322, pST4-1, pST4-11, or pST4-12 and incubated for 1 h 
at 30°C. The mixture was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, plated onto LB-agar 
plates supplemented with or without KM, and incubated at 37°C overnight. Colonies 
were counted, and the lysogeny rate was calculated by dividing the number of colonies 
yielded on LB plates containing KM by that yielded on LB plates without KM.
AbpA and AbpB structure prediction and alignment
Three-dimensional AbpA (UniProt ID: P52127) and AbpB (UniProt ID: P52126) model 
structures were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( https://
alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) (36, 37). AbpA and AbpB structural homologs were searched on the 
Dali server using the AbpA and AbpB models as queries ( http://ekhidna2.biocenter.hel­
sinki.fi/dali/) (38). Superimposing the AbpA model to Cap4 (PDB ID: 6WAN [ 18]) and the 
AbpB model to human RNA helicase Ddp5 (PB ID: 3FHT [ 21]) was performed using the 
SUPERPOSE program ( 39). All protein structures were depicted using the open-source
