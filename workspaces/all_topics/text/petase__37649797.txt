Abstract: Plastics have quickly become an integral part of modern life. Due to excessive production 
and improper waste disposal, they are recognized as contaminants present in practically all habitat 
types. Although there are several polymers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is of particular concern 
due to its abundance in the environment. There is a need for a solution that is both cost -effective and 
ecologically friendly to address this pollutant. The use of microbial depolymerizing enzymes could 
offer a biological avenue for plastic degradation, though the full  potential of these enzymes is yet to 
be uncovered. The purpose of this study was to use (1) plate -based screening methods to investigate 
the plastic degradation potential of marine bacteria from the order Enterobacterales collected from 
various organismal and environmental sources, and (2) perform genome -based analysis to identify 
polyesterases potentially related to PET degradation. 126 bacterial isolates were obtained from the 
strain collection of RD3, Research Unit Marine Symbioses -GEOMAR-and sequential ly tested for 
esterase and polyesterase activity, in combination here referred to as PETase–like activity. The results 
show that members of the microbial families Alteromonadaceae, Shewanellaceae, and Vibrionaceae, 
derived from marine sponges and bryozoans , are the most promising candidates within the order 
Enterobacterales. Furthermore, 389 putative hydrolases from the α/β superfamily were identified in 23 
analyzed genomes, of which 22 were sequenced for this study. Several candidates showed similarities 
with known PETases, indicating underlying enzymatic potential within the order Enterobacterales for 
PET degradation.

1. Introduction  
Marine microbial communities play a key role in the maintenance and support of the marine 
ecosystems health [1]. Due to the diversity of interactions, including their adaptation to extreme 
conditions [2] and host–associated interactions [3], marine microorganisms have evolved a remarkable 
variety of enzymatic systems that are involved in many biological reactions [4], and exhibit novel 
biocatalytic properties [4,5]. By leveraging their ability to catalyze biological reactions, marine 
microorganisms have the potential to be used as a cost –effective and sustainable way to reduce 
pollution and mitigate the negative impacts caused by mankind. 
Plastics have become an important part of our daily lives. Their versatility, durability, and 
convenience (i.e., low –cost production and d isposable nature) have led us to become increasingly 
dependent on them. It is estimated that plastic production reached 390 million metric tons (Mt) 
worldwide in 2021 [6]. Due to disposal mismanagement, about 4 to 12.7 Mt of plastics ultimately end 
up in the ocean every year [7]. Here, they are integrated into various trophic levels, predominantly in 
the form of micro – and nanoparticles (size < 5 mm) [8,9], and associated with the spread of 
contaminants and invasive species [10–14].  
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely pro duced polymer used in a variety of       
applications [15,16]. By 2021, the annual production exceeded 30 Mt [6]. Recycling strategies such as 
mechanical or chemical degradation have been proposed [17 –19], but these methods often involve 
high energetic costs or/and are limited to specific operative requirements. In contrast, biodegradation 
strategies offer a more energy –efficient and environmentally friendly recycling alternative, and for 
PET one of the best–characterized depolymerization enzymes described to date is available [20–24]. PET–
active enzymes belong to carboxylic ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1), which also include cutinases (EC 
3.1.1.74), lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), and esterases (EC 3.1.1.1) [25]. Most of the known PET–active enzymes 
have a bacterial orig in [26], these hydrolases have been described from the terrestrial thermophilic 
Thermobifida fusca [27] and the mesophilic Ideonella sakaensis [28], to name the most prominent 
examples. Only a few have been found in eukaryotes. One such example is the fung us Aspergillus, 
with several species from different habitats being reported to degrade various types of plastic [29].  
PET–acting enzymes are generally characterized as serine hydrolases that typically have a catalytic 
triad in their active site (Ser -His-Asp) and an α/β–hydrolase fold [1,30]. Functionally verified PET 
hydrolases have shown to contain a canonical C -terminal disulfide bond, whereby some having an 
additional disulfide bond elsewhere as well [30–32]. 
In recent years, marine –associated microorganisms have gained attention due to their ability to 
degrade PET [26]. Nevertheless, their degradative properties remain to be identified for many taxa, 
and the mechanisms involved are still unknown [33]. However, by utilizing existing strain collections 
it is possible to investigate the degradation potential of different microbial groups. Gambarini and 
colleagues found that a significant proportion (15.9%) of the plastic –degrading organisms described 
in the literature were derived from strain collections, w ith bacterial groups from the Proteobacteria 
phylum (30.4%) showing promise [33].  
The order Enterobacterales consists of a large and diverse group of bacteria defined as non–spore–
forming, gram–negative, facultative anaerobic, and belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria [34]. 
Members of this group inhabit a variety of ecological niches and are found in both terrestrial and aquatic 
520 
AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
environments –freshwater and marine, and in association with a wide range of living organisms [35,36]. 
There are 15 defined bacterial families in the class Enterobacterales, of which characteristic genera 
such as Alteromonas [37], Colwellia [38], Enterobacter [39–41], Pseudoalteromonas [42–44], 
Shewanella [45], Thalassomonas [44,46], and Vibrio [44] have been described as capable of degrading 
complex natural hydrocarbons such as chitin, collagen, agar, and cellulose. Furthermore, they belong 
to the unique group of so–called obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB), which are responsible 
for most of the natural degradation of  hydrocarbon contaminants in the marine ecosystem [47]. 
Previous reports indicate that members of the above–mentioned families can display cutinase, esterase, 
and lipase activity. These enzymes are closely related to the degradation of PET and represent an  
interesting group that should be investigated for their degradation potential [39,41,42,45,47]. 
The main objective of this study was to investigate selected marine Enterobacterales strains from 
our strain collection to reveal potential enzymatic activities of biotechnological relevance. A standardized 
agar plate –based screening was employed to evaluate microbial PETase -like activity [48,49].  
Bioinformatical tools were then used to generate a phylogenetic tree and profile the detected PET 
hydrolase related activity. The study revealed that the main candidates for PETase –like activity are 
bacterial strains belonging to the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Photobacterium, and Vibrio associated 
with marine sponges and bryozoans. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Bacterial selection and cultivation  
2.1.1. Selection 
In this study, a total of 125 bacterial strains of the order Enterobacterales were selected from the 
strain collection of our Research Unit Marine Symbiosis to evaluate their potential for degrading PET. 
The sel ection process involved combining a neighbor –joining reference tree of potential PET 
hydrolase activities generated by Danso and colleagues in 2018 [26] with a targeted search of the 
genome–based Taxonomy Database for Prokaryotic Genomes (GTDB) [50]. This approach enabled 
the identification of putative strain candidates with the highest potential for PET degradation based on 
their evolutionary relationships and taxonomic classification.  
Additional parameters, such as the marine source the strain was isolat ed from, were recorded. A 
variety of habitats and associated organism sources –algae, bryozoans, cnidarians, hydrozoans, 
bivalves, nematodes, sediment, sponges, fishes, and seawater–were included (Supplementary Material 
Table S1). In addition, bar graphs were created using RStudio (version 2022.7.1.554) [51] to show the 
source and activity distributions of the strains tested relative to their family–level identity. 
2.1.2. Taxonomic confirmation and phylogenetic tree construction 
Pure bacterial strains were cultured on agar plates with marine broth (MB) (BD                        
Difco™ 2216; 37.4 g/L) (Bacto™ agar; 15 g/L) and incubated for one week at room temperature. In 
parallel, colonies were taken from each isolate as a subsample to check taxonomic  status. DNA was 
extracted using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN®, Germany) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Primers 27F (5' -GAGTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5' -
521 
AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT -3') were used to amplify 16S rRNA gene fragments [52, 53]. Gene 
fragments were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% w/v peqGOLD universal agarose in 1 x 
TAE buffer) and sequenced by Eurofins (Eurofins Umwelt Nord GmbH Branch, Kiel, Germany). 
For phylogenetic tree construction, the 16S rRNA gene sequenc es were merged into a FASTA–
formatted file using MEGA-X [54]. The sequences were aligned using the Neighbor–Joining method (NJ) 
with ClustalW2 [55]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using FastTree [56,57]. The Interactive 
Tree of Life [58] was used to visualize the tree, and the Annotation Editor Tool (iTOL version 6.5.8) [59] 
was used to record the corresponding metadata. 
2.2. Functional screening using polymer-based indicator plates 
A modified version of the standardized agar plate method to detect polyesterase activity of Molitor et 
al. (2020) was used to screen the selected strains. An initial screening using tributyrin (TRI, 1.5% v/v in 
MB) as a substrate was performed to establish the presence of general esterase activity. To determine 
more specific polyesterase and "PETase –like" activity, two additional aliphatic polyester substrates, 
polycaprolactone diol (PCD Mn530, 1.5% v/v in MB) and polycaprolactone (PCL, 1,5% v/v in MB) 
were tested [48]. Additional testing was performed to confirm the presence of PET–like activity with 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET, ~0.5 mM v/v in MB) using the methodology described by 
Perez-Garcia and colleagues [49]. Bacterial isolates were tested in triplicate. Positive isolates showed 
a clear halo after 10 days of incubation at room temperature, and additional activity controls were 
performed after three, five, and seven days of incubation (Figure 1). Based on the results, the activity 
was categorized as follows: low activity (+), medium activity (++) and high ac tivity (+++). 
Furthermore, in order to discriminate between PETase -like and PETase activity, PET nanoparticle 
media was produced (PETnp, ~0.3 mg/mL in MB) using the methodology described by Perez -Garcia 
and colleagues [49]. Finally, PET foils (Goodfellow, ES301445/8) were incubated with 8 ml of MB 
medium with the corresponding isolate at room temperature (21 ℃) for 30 days. After incubation, the 
foils were washed with water, followed by two washes with 100% ethanol. They were then dried at 37 ℃ 
for 48 hours and the weight was recorded subsequently.

2.3 Mining for PETase-like enzymes  
2.3.1. Oxford Nanopore Technologies™ whole–genome–sequencing 
After plate–based screening, 23 candidates with prominent polyesterase activity were confirmed 
and selected. 22 were chosen for genome sequencing, and one additional was obtained from NCBI 
database (DSM 3368 T) (Accession number: GCA_001083805.1). High molecular weight DNA w as 
extracted using a sample preparation and lysis protocol described in the Qiagen® Genomic DNA 
Handbook and purified using the Genomic-Tip 100/G (QIAGEN®, Germany) column. The quality of 
the DNA extraction was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% w/v peqGOLD universal agarose 
in 1 x TAE buffer) and quality was assessed using the A260/280 ratio of a NanoDrop ™ 
spectrophotometer [60]. All 22 strains of interest were sequenced using the Rapid Sequencing Kit® 
(RAD-004) according to the manufacturer's specifications. MinION Flongle flow cell loaded with the 
extracted genomic DNA was set at 230 Hz, 35 °C for 24 hours. The respective base calling was 
performed by converting the raw sequence data (FAST5) into FASTQ files, which was done using 
Guppy software (version 2.3.1 from Oxford Nanopore Technologies™). 
2.4. Bioinformatic analyses 
2.4.1 Nucleic acid quality control and taxonomy  
FASTQ sequence files obtained with the Guppy software were used to generate a genome 
assembly using Flye software (version 2.8.2) [61]. The resulting genomes were first used to assess the 
quality of the sequenced genomes using CheckM [62]. To accurately classify the genomes, the Genome 
Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB-Tk v2.0.7) [63] was employed. In GTDB-Tk, genes were called 
using Prodigal [64] and bacterial marker genes were identified using HMMER [65]. Sequences were 
then inserted into a domain–specific reference tree using pplacer [66]. Taxonomic classification was based 
on a combination of sequence placement within the GTDB, its relative evolutionary divergence (RED), 
and average nucleotide identity (ANI) with the reference genomes [62]. 
2.4.2 Protein analysis and homology modeling  
FASTA nucleotide files were translated with Prodigal (v2.6.3). Functional annotation of the 
predicted protein output was performed with EggNOG mapper (v 2.0) using eggNOG database v.5.0 [67]. 
A database of potential PETase proteins was created from all 22–genomes sequenced plus one genome 
from NCBI database (DSM 3368T/A TCC 29999, accession number FMWJ00000000). The query criterion 
included all ortholog group hits belonging to domains of the superfamily of α/β–hydrolases_5 (pfam12695). 
Following the method for genomic enzyme mining proposed by Almeida and colleagues. (2019) [68], 
phylogenetic analyses we re conducted on the selected protein sequences with MEGA -X [54] using 
maximum likelihood statistical method and W AG + G model, with 1000 bootstrap replications with 50% 
bootstrap cut–off value. A reference dataset was conducted in parallel with the phylogenetic analysis, 
which integrated from the plastics–active enzymes database–PAZy [69] including 10 PET hydrolases 
and homolog polyesterases from the Gammaproteobacteria, and IsPETase (ISF6_4831) from Ideonella 
sakaensis [28]. Both were used to create a custom BLASTP dataset.

AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
2.4.3 Genome mining  
The amino acid sequences of interest were aligned using T-COFFEE Expresso [70]. Final outputs 
were represented and analyzed using ESPript 3.0 [71], and the Lipase Engineering Database–LED [72] 
served to identify the  catalytic triad and oxyanion residues. SignalP 5.0 [73], was used to estimate 
cleavage sites for secretory protein signal peptides to indicate the specific localization of the enzymatic 
activity. Finally, structural homologs were confirmed using 3D struct ure comparisons with 
RoseTTAFold software [74]. 
3. Results 
3.1. Overview of bacterial isolates 
Bacterial isolates used in this study covered five families within the order Enterobacterales: 
Alteromonadaceae (53 isolates), Enterobacteraceae (2 isolates), Morganellaceae (6 isolates), 
Shewanellaceae (37 isolates), and Vibrionaceae (27 isolates). The family Alteromonadaceae accounted 
for the greatest number of isolates, including representatives from the genera Alteromonas (15), 
Paraglaciecola (3), and Pseudoalteromonas (35). The family Shewanellaceae had the second -most 
abundant number of isolates, with Shewanella (37). As for Vibrionaceae, more restrictive selection 
criteria were employed to comply with laboratory safety rules, and only strains belonging to the risk 
group 1 were used. The two genera tested were Photobacterium (2) and Vibrio (25). Morganellaceae 
isolates incl uded representatives of Xenorhabdus (6). The family Enterobacteraceae covering 
Escherichia (1), and Thalassomonas (1) (Figure 2). Each isolate was inoculated onto all four MB agar 
substrates. Additional strain information, such as isolation source is shown in Supplementary Material 
Table S1. 
3.2. Functional screening using polymer–based indicator plates 
Based on the size of the clearing halo area, all strains tested were classified in categories: “ –, no 
activity”, “+, low activity," "++, medium activity" or  "+++, high activity". For the esterase enzyme 
screening with tributyrin MB –enriched media, 71 had low activity, 41 had medium activity, and 3 
demonstrated high activity. The high activity strains were M71_N36 (Alteromonas sp.),                 Hal099 
(Pseudoalteromonas sp.), and DSM 23640T (Vibrio caribeanicus). A total of 11 isolates were not active 
on tributyrin–MB plates, although all of them grew on the media.   For polyesterase activity on PCD 
supplemented MB agar plates, 69 isolates had no activity, 48 presented low activity, 8 had medium 
activity, and one (strain PP-XX7, Vibrio sp.) revealed high activity. PCL–supplemented MB agar plates 
were used to test for PETase–like activity. 69 isolates had no activity, 35 presented low activity, 17 had 
medium activity, and 6 (all representatives from the family Alteromonadaceae, strains: Hal273, Hal099, 
Hal040, Hal056, B160, and B179) revealed high activity. 
For the esterase assay on BHET–supplemented MB agar plates, a  total of 59 strains, which 
presented some activity for PCL, were tested for activity on BHET MB –enriched media. 37 isolates 
were inactive, 11 presented low activity, 6 had medium activity, and 8 revealed high activity. 24 of the 
BHET active isolates were further used for PETnp plate incubation test, of which five displayed high 
activity, two medium activity, four slight activity and 13 no activity (Supplementary Material  Table 
S2). 11 of the 24 BHET active strains were further used for a liquid incubation assay of the strains in 
524

MB media with PET foil. After 30 days of incubation at room temperature (21 ℃) no weight loss could 
be determined, but rather a slight weight increase in the range of 0.5 –3% (Supplementary Material  
Table S3).

Enterobacterales is displayed. The screening results are displayed from the inside out for 
the respective activities on TRI, PCD, PCL and BHET. As outgroup we used DSM 8802T 
Bacillus halotolerans.  
3.3. Isolates source–based classification 
The source of each strain was documented for each of the isolates. Almost all strains tested were 
associated with a different host organism, though there were samples obtained from the water column, 
sediment, and one strain isolated from biofilm on marine bone experiments (strain SA48) in the Kieler 
Fjord. There were 11 s ource categories (Figure 3) covered: algae (11), bryozoans (36), cnidaria (1), 

525 
AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
fish (8), hydrozoans (9), mussels (1), nematodes (7), sediment (13), sponges (27), and water (10). There 
were three strains from biofilm collections, one from marine bone degradation experiments (strain SA48) 
and the other two purchased from the DSMZ -German Strain Collection of Microorganisms and Cell 
Cultures, (strains DSM 498T, and DSM 507T). According to the database these strains were included 
in the category "other". As shown in Figure 3, strains isolated from bryozoans (36) and sponges (27) 
dominate in the number of strains tested per source.   Both sources present strains with polyesterase 
related activity. Strains originating from bryozoans are widely distributed throughout  the tree; 
represented families include Alteromonadaceae (17), Shewanellaceae (11), and Vibrionaceae (5). 
Sponge isolates were the most diverse, with members from Alteromonadaceae (10), Vibrionaceae (7), 
Shewanellaceae (7), and Enterobacteraceae (1).

taxonomic affiliation within the order Enterobacterales. The stacked bar plot shows the 
number of isolates tested by their origin sources, where isolates obtained from bryozoans 
and sponges build the majority. The plot also shows the counting results in relation to 
bacterial family representatives per source.  
3.4. Mining for PETase–like activity  
3.4.1. Taxonomic identification and DNA quality control   
Following positive results  on BHET MB –enriched media, 23 isolates were selected for their 
potential polyesterase activity for genome sequencing, as well as from NCBI database (DSM 3368T). 
Genomic DNA was extracted and MinION ™ device–based sequencing (Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies) was performed for the 22 isolates selected, utilizing one Flonge flow cell (Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies) per genome. The correct taxonomic identification was obtained using GTDB-

Five genera were linked to potential PETase–like activity in this study including: Vibrio (8), 
Pseudoalteromonas (12), Shewanella (2), as well as one representative strain for Photorhabdus and 
Photobacterium. The respective genome quality, purity, size, and predicted genes for the 
aforementioned selected strains are displayed in detail in Supplementary Material (Table S4). 
3.5. Computational protein analyses 
Sequences related to esterase activity were extracted from the 23 genomes, yielding 389 
sequences of interest. These sequences and known PETases (Supplementary Material Table S5) were 
included for comparison in a phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Material Figure S6).   
Results from the phylogenetic survey highlighted three groups of interest, each group associated 
with a previ ously identified PETase enzyme (Table 2). Group one included two predicted esterases 
from strains Hal110 and Hal280 related to ISF6 -4831, isolated from Ideonella sakaensis [28]. The 
second group is a complex of hydrolase proteins from isolates B160, Hal099, and Hal110, which were 
associated with PmC cutinase isolated from Pseudomonas mendocina [77]. Group three was associated 
with Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase (EC 3.1.1.75) , Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) is a

biodegradable alternative to plastics used in packaging and cosmetic industry [80]. The associated 
sequences originated from the strains Hal054, Hal280, and Hal342.

The ortholog protein sequences of interest were screened using the LED database to determine 
their respective fold homolog. Through this process two protein sequences, Hal280 -CE (a 
carboxylesterase from Pseudoaltermonas atlantica) and Hal099-E (an esterase from Photobacterium 
sp.), were identified as related to Mors1 lipase type II and PmC cutinase, respectively. To confirm their 
relatedness, all reference enzymes were grouped together, and their relationship is shown in Figure 4. 
In a maximum–likelihood phylogenetic tree with reference PETases, both protein sequences of 
interest are placed outside of the clade. The signal peptide sequence found in Hal099 -E suggests a 
potential for extracellular localization with a cleavage site between position  17 and 18, and was 
identified as Sec/SPII with >99% probability. Hal280-CE showed signal for a not specified type signal 
peptide (Supplementary Material Table S7).

sequences is indicated by colour coded purple circles and yellow triangles, as determined

Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated using T -COFFEE Expresso and rendered 
with ESPript 3.0 to incorporate structural information including the location of the alpha helices and 
beta sheets linked to the protein sequences. Mors1 was selected for amino acid comparison with 
Hal280-CE (Figure 5). The resulting MSA shows that 30% of the amino acids in Hal280 -CE were 
identical to Mors1, 2.8% were conserved. Hal280 -CE contains the pentapeptide motif G -x1-S-x2-G, 
which is typical for previously reported polyesterases [1]. Instead of a Trp at position x1 and Met at 
position x2 in Mors1, Hal280-CE presents an Asp at x1 and a Gly at x2.

Figure 5. Amino acid sequence alignment of Hal280-CE polyesterase and Mors1. Hal280-
CE was suggested as a suitable structural homolog for Mors1 by the LED server. Amino 
acid residues coloured in red correspond to the ones strictly conserved between Mors1 and 
Hal280-CE, while residues highlighted in yellow show areas with an average level of 
homology. The pentapeptide motif G -x1-S-x2-G is framed and highlighted by a purple 
rectangle. 
PmC was selected for amino acid comparison with Hal099 -E (Figure 6). The resulting MSA 
inferred only 19% of the amino acids were identical to PmC, and 1.5% conserved. The pentapeptide 
motif in G -x1-S-x2-G is present . There is a beta sheet followed by an al pha helix where the 
pentapeptide is located, this is characteristic for polyesterase activity associated enzymes [1]. 
Structural homolog analysis was limited due to the short length of the sequence.

4. Discussion 
In this study, the method described by Molitor and colleagues [48] and Pérez –García and 
colleagues [49] was adap ted to investigate potential polyesterase activity associated with the 
degradation of PET. The strain selection criteria proved successful in finding potential candidates 
within the order Enterobacterales. Of the 126 strains tested, 91% showed positive est erase activity 
when tested for tributyrin. These positive results are associated with a variety of enzymatic activities, 
such as acyltransferases, lipases, polyesterases, and other hydrolases [48], not all of which are 
necessarily associated with PETase –like activity. To identify polyesterase activity potentially 
associated with degradation of PET, three substrates targeting this activity were investigated. PCD was 
used to detect polyesterase activity, since PCD is a liquid, emulsifiable, low molecular weight derivate 
from PCL. It provided a suitable assay to test polyesterase activity without the use of potentially toxic 
solvents [48]. However, the results of this plate –based assay were inconsistent, as 45% of the strains 
tested did not grow on the media, and of those that did grow, 22% were not active. PCL was used as a 
second substrate to detect polyesterase activity, with polycaprolactone (PCL) described as the standard 
substrate for this purpose [48,68] . Because of its semicrystalline structure and the s imilarity of its 
physical and chemical properties to PET, this polyester was selected to demonstrate PETase –like 
activity [48].  
 

531 
AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
The strains tested with high activity in all media tested (TRI, PCD, PCL, and BHET) were 
members of the genus Pseudoalteromonas, isolated mainly from sponges and bryozoans. Liu and 
colleagues (2019) previously described the PCL –degrading capacity of marine Pseudoalteromonas 
members, which was coincidentally associated with positive tributyrin activity in most cases [81]. It 
remains clear that the combination of tributyrin and PCL screening may provide a promising approach 
to detect esterase and polyesterase activity. Overall, 54% of the selected strains were inactive on PCL–
enriched media. However, all strains tested with high PCL  activity were also active towards             
BHET (bis[2 -hydroxyethyl]terephthalate), which is an intermediate product in the generation and 
degradation of PET. BHET is one of the major degradation products of PET films and fibres [82]. The 
BHET activity screening was a successful step toward assessing PETase–like activities that belong to 
the category of PETase group I or PET surface –modifying enzymes [25]. PETases from this group 
have already attracted the attention of the industry, as they can be used to produce polyester textiles 
that are predominantly based on PET [25]. 
Furthermore, the identification of polyesterase activity under the given culture conditions (25 ℃) 
could indicate a mesophilic nature of the PETase –like activity found, where optimal degradation 
activity for these enzymes could potentially occur at temperatures between 30 and 45 ℃ [26]. Whether 
this is the case depends on each bacterial strain, their optimal growth temperature, and their enzymatic 
properties. The results obtained in this study show that 20% of the strains tested were active on BHET 
substrate plates, of which 53% belonged to Pseudoalteromonas, 32% to Vibrio, 7% to Shewanella, as 
well as one representative of Photobacterium and Photorhabdus, suggesting a possible taxonomic 
relationship of polyesterase activity within the order Enterobacterales. The BHET positive strains were 
further tested on PET nanoparticle containing agar plates and for their capacity to reduce the weight 
of low-crystallinity PET foil in a liquid assay. While some isolates produced noticeable halos on PETnp 
plates (Supplementary Material Figure S8 and Table S2), none of the isolates lead to a weight reduction 
of PET foil over 30 days (Supplementary Material Table S3). The detected halo formation on PETnp 
plates might be attributable to residual agarose activity of the isolates, leading to a false-positive result. 
The results of these assays are therefore inconclusive and true PETase activity remains to be proven.  
Interestingly, most of the positive screen results for polyesterase activity (Figure 7) were isolated 
from sponges (7) and bryozoans (6). Others also reported potential polyesterase activity in the 
microbiome of these organisms. In a recent study by Carr and col leagues (2022) [1], a cutinase –like 
polymerase (BgP) and further putative PETase genes were confirmed to be present in five isolates from 
deep–sea sponges [1]. The authors described holobiont –associated bacterial species as a possible 
source of PETase acti vity. Another example of sponges associated microorganisms with related 
PETase–like activity was studied by Almeida and colleagues [68]. The authors found a Streptomyces 
sp. strain (SM14) isolated from the sponge Haliclona simulans with synthetic polyester degradation 
activities. The presence of collagenolytic enzymes in sponges and their relationship with the recycling 
of spongins –collagen like fibrillar proteins– [83], might be involved in the degradation of other natural 
hydrocarbons [44] possibly also including polymer degradation.

Figure 7. Substrate activity per tested source. The stacked bar plot shows the activity count 
accordingly to the tested media for lipase (TRI), polyesterase (PCD and PCL), 
carboxylesterase–like (BHET), and absence of activity where the count is depicted by 
origin source.  
In addition, bryozoans have been frequently associated with plastic litter in marine environments. 
These small aquatic invertebrates have been observed attached to various types of polymers [84,85], 
which likely contributes to their widespread dispersal by plastic debris in the ocean [86]. It is therefore 
not surprising that symbiotic microorganisms from these hitchhikers of plastic debris might develop 
the ability to utilize plastic polymers as a carbon source, even just as a moon-lighting activity of other 
secreted enzymes. Recent research has revealed a potential link between bacteria isolated from marine 
symbiotic species and the presence of polyesterase activity [1,68], which can be attributed to the 
diverse and metabolically varied communities that often coexist in microbial environments, rather than 
single, genetically identical individuals [87]. This functional diversity may enable ecological and 
evolutionary adaptations of microbial communities, conferring specific advantages such as increased 
energy efficiency and resistance to disturbances [88]. These findings could have important implications 
for the development of effective plastic debris mitigation strategies, inc luding the optimization and 
testing of alternative recycling models [43,79,89]. The most prominent example of such an adaptation 
albeit perhaps being an exception, is the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, which was isolated from a 
sample stemming from the proximity of a plastic recycling plant [28].  
After orthologue sequences were selected from 23 genomes, 389 protein sequences belonging to 
the α/β hydrolase superfamily, which includes proteins with esterase and lipase activity, were identified. 
When looking at the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Material, Figure S3) the 
potential of hydrolase activity related to polyesters is shown to be widely distributed in the order 
Enterobacterales. In fact, the proteins affiliated with the α/β hydrolase superfamily have been described 
to have several functions, acting as hydrolases, lyases, transferases, hormone precursors or transporters, 
and as chaperones for other proteins [90,91]. The agar–plate screening methodology used in this study 

533 
AIMS Microbiology  V olume 9, Issue 3, 518–539. 
indicates that there is a considerable amount of polyesterase activity in the tested strains, suggesting 
that further research into true PET degradation might be worthwhile. The combination of experimental 
assays and computational tools helped to reveal the potential  of polyesterase activity within different 
families of the order Enterobacterales. 
The esterases identified in the genomes of Hal280 -CE ( Photobacterium sp.) and                     
Hal099-E (Pseudoalteromonas sp.) are related to the verified PET –active enzymes Mors1 [75] and 
PmC [77], respectively. The association of the putative esterase from Hal280 -CE to Mors1 presented 
low similarity (30%, results from the MSA), while having a conserved region for the pentapeptide 
motif G -x1-S-x2-G, where the catalytic a ctive Ser is present. The amino acid sequence similarity 
between Hal099-E to PmC was of 19%. Like Hal280-CE, Hal099-E shows also the pentapeptide motif. 
The presence of the conserved G -x1-S-x2-G-motif and the close relationship to previously described 
PET–active enzymes provide evidence that Hal099-E and Hal280-CE are putative esterases potentially 
responsible for the BHET–activity in the associated strains. 
5. Conclusions 
This study conducted an in –depth screening of marine bacterial strains from the order 
Enterobacterales. The different isolation sources from the investigated strains supported an exploration 
of potential polyesterase activity from a variety of marine environments. The use of standardized 
screening methods has proven to be suitable for determi ning polyesterase activity. The results of this 
study indicate that bacteria isolated from sponges and bryozoans could be  a promising source of 
polyesterase activity. Symbiotic and holobiont organisms may be valuable  potential candidates for 
bioremediation of plastic pollution, which could facilitate a move  towards a more sustainable blue 
marine economy model [4,22]. The large number of orthologous proteins associated with α/β–
superfamily hydrolases found in this stud y suggests that polyesterases may be more diverse than 
previously reported, and encompass a broad repertoire of active sites [80]. Furthermore, the added 
value of experimental assays supported by computational tools has revealed the potential of marine 
bacteria from the order Enterobacterales for PETase -like activity, indicating greater diversity and 
distribution of this particular type of enzymatic activity, as previously thought.
