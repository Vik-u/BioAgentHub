Abstract
Transaminase enzymes (TAms) are becoming increasingly valuable in the chemist ’s toolbox as a biocatalytic route to chiral
amines. Despite high profile successes, the lack of ( R)-selective TAms and robustness under harsh industrial conditions continue
to prove problematic. Herein, we report the isolation of the first haloarchaeal TAm (BC61-TAm) to be characterised for the
purposes of pharmaceutical biocatalysis. BC61-TAm is an ( R)-selective enzyme, cloned from an extremely halophilic archaeon,
isolated from a Triassic period salt mine. Produced using a Haloferax volcanii–based expression model, the resulting protein
displays a classic halophilic activity profile, as well as thermotolerance (optimum 50 °C) and organic solvent tolerance.
Molecular modelling predicts the putative active site residues of haloarchaeal TAms, with molecular dynamics simulations
providing insights on the basis of BC61-TAm ’s organic solvent tolerance. These results represent an exciting advance in the
study of transaminases from extremophiles, providing a possible scaffold for future discovery of biocatalytic enzymes with
robust properties.

Introduction
Chiral amines are valuable building blocks for the pharmaceu-
tical industry, representing versatile intermediates in the syn-
thesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Their syn-
thesis using conventional chemical means can suffer from a
number of critical drawbacks, including the need for volatile
organic solvents and toxic transition metal catalysts, as well as
a lack of enantioselectivity in a single step (Malik et al. 2012).
Biocatalytic routes to optically active amines have emerged
as a ‘green’ alternative to conventional synthetic chemistry
approaches, expanding the chemist ’s toolbox and affording
an economically viable approach for the production of these
valuable compounds. The ability of biocatalysts to operate in
aqueous media, as well as at ambient temperature and neutral
pH, makes them extremely desirable and useful in
streamlining API synthesis.
To date, a number of enzymes have been employed in the
production of chiral amines, including hydrolases, lyases, ox-
idases and dehydrogenases (Busto et al. 2011; Kroutil et al.
2013; Sharma et al. 2017). The demand for efficient produc-
tion of optically active amines has also driven research into the
use of transaminase enzymes (TAms) for this purpose.
TAms are pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) –dependent enzymes
capable of transferring an amine group from a donor molecule
to a prochiral ketone, resulting in the formation of a chiral
amine. Their use in industrial biocatalysis has been the subject
of a number of recent reviews (Malik et al. 2012; Ghislieri and
Turner 2013; Kohls et al. 2014; Guo and Berglund 2017;
Kelly et al. 2018). TAms have been employed in the synthesis

of a number of drug molecules (Fuchs et al. 2010; Mangion
et al. 2012; Midelfort et al. 2013), with their capabilities best
showcased in the production of the antidiabetic drug
sitagliptin (Savile et al. 2010). In this highly successful exam-
ple, a bacterial TAm, optimised by protein engineering,
brought about the conversion of the prochiral ketone
prositagliptin to the chiral amine molecule sitagliptin. As well
as replacing a number of chemical steps, including a hydro-
genation step requiring expensive high-pressure equipment,
this biocatalytic approach also improved overall yield and
reduced waste.
TAms, as with other enzymes, are not without drawbacks.
A narrow substrate scope and an inability to deal with chal-
lenging conditions often demanded by industrial processes,
highlight the need for improvement of the current TAm tool-
box. Whilst TAms possess the advantage of being highly
enantioselective, a consideration which is critical for pharma-
ceutical production, the lack of ( R)-selective TAms in the cur-
rent catalogue is an issue which must be addressed. Important
steps have been taken in order to overcome this barrier, in-
cluding the use of rational design to reverse the
enantiopreference of TAms (Svedendahl et al. 2010; Humble
et al. 2012), but the issue remains problematic. The discovery
of naturally ( R)-selective TAms, whilst challenging, is the
most obvious route to address this current impasse.
Shortfalls encountered with currently available TAms have
led to a number of approaches for improvement and process-
specific optimisation. Protein engineering has brought about
significant advances in both activity and substrate range
(Savile et al. 2010;N o b i l ie ta l .2015; Dourado et al. 2016),
whilst another viable option is the search for novel enzymes
with naturally optimised capabilities, such as enzymes from
environments whose conditions more closely mimic those of
industrial processes. With the majority of current enzymes
derived from culturable mesophilic bacteria, the quest for
new TAms has been expanded to include metagenomic min-
ing, including those from the archaeal domain, and from ex-
treme environments (Littlechild 2015;B a u de ta l . 2017;
Bezsudnova et al. 2017).
Interrogation of extreme environments has focused
heavily on enzymes from ther mophilic organisms, which
have been studied in much greater detail relative to their
halophilic counterparts. Scarcely is this trend more evi-
dent than with halophilic TAms, where the number of
enzymes has been quite limited to date (Muriana et al.
1991). This is surprising given the range of extreme con-
ditions halophilic microorganisms, and often by exten-
sion their enzymes, can tolerate not only functioning at
high salt concentrations but also with increased temper-
atures, in organic solvent, and often at elevated pH
(Hough and Danson 1999; Doukyu and Ogino 2010;
Amoozegar et al. 2017). This ‘polyextremophilicity ’ in-
dicates that halophilic enzymes have the ability to
tolerate a range of harsh conditions, and with it the abil-
ity to effectively ‘green ’ a multitude of industrial
processes.
The most extreme adaptations of halophiles are generally
the reserve of haloarchaea. Archaea represents the third do-
main of life, proposed for the first time as recently as 1990
(Woese et al. 1990). As such, they remain hugely understudied
relative to their bacterial counterparts, and represent a poten-
tially vast untapped resource of novel and diverse biocatalysts.
In this study, we describe a TAm from a haloarchaeon,
Halorubrum sp. CSM-61, isolated from a Triassic period ha-
lite deposit (formed circa 220 –25
 0 mya). To our knowledge,
this is the first example of a haloarchaeal TAm to be cloned
and overexpressed and investigated for its potential use in
biocatalysis.
Materials and methods
Organism isolation and identification
Organism CSM-61 was isolated by inoculating media con-
taining (per litre) rock salt from Kilroot salt mine (250 g),
yeast extract (10 g), casein hydrolysate (7.5 g) and glycerol
(10 mL) with 100 μL undiluted brine collected from a brine
stream within the mine. Identification was based on the 16S
rRNA gene and performed using colony PCR as described
previously (Supporting information; Kelly et al. 2017), using
the universal primers ARCH21F (5 ′ -TTCC
GGTTGATCCYGCCGGA-3′) and 958R (5 ′-YCCGGCGT
TGAMTCCAATT-3′).
DNA extraction and PCR amplification of BC61-TAm
gene
Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced, and the assem-
bled genome annotated and BC61-TAm identified as de-
scribed previously (Supporting information ; Kelly et al.
2017). Forward (5 ′ -TTTTTTCCATGG GATT
CGACGAGATGGAC-3′) and reverse (5 ′-TTTTTTGAAT
TCTTATACGTAGGTGAACCAGTCGTC-3′) primers were
designed specific to the gene sequence (Invitrogen, UK) with
restriction sites included for NcoIa n d EcoRI-HF respectively
(highlighted in bold). The BC61-TAm gene was amplified and
checked as described previously ( Supporting information ;
Kelly et al. 2017).
Preparation of pTA1228/BC61-TAm plasmid
and transformation of Escherichia coli
The pTA1228/BC61-TAm plasmid was prepared as follows:
25 μL pTA1228 vector was cut using restriction enzymes PciI
(1 μL) in Tango buffer (3 μL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK)
5728 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:5727 –5737
and EcoRI-HF (1 μL) in CutSmart buffer (3 μL) in two sep-
arate single digests, with purification between each digest
using a GeneJet PCR Purification kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, UK). Alkaline Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (CIP)
(NEB) was subsequently added to the pTA1228 mix and in-
cubated for a further 1 h at 37 °C. BC61-TAm gene was cut
using NcoI( 1 μL) and EcoRI-HF (1 μL) in CutSmart buffer
(3 μL) in a double digest, followed by PCR purification.
Ligation and transformation of One Shot® TOP10
Chemically Competent E. coli cells were carried out as de-
scribed previously (Supporting information ; Kelly et al.
2017).
Transformation of Hfx. volcanii H1424
with pTA1228/BC61-TAm
Hfx. volcanii H1424 cells (Stroud et al. 2012) were trans-
formed using a protocol described previously by the Allers
group (Nuttall et al. 2009). A primary culture of Hfx. volcanii
H1424 (10 mL, OD
550 ≈ 0.8) was pelleted at 6000 rpm for
8 min. The pellet was suspended in 2 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.5 buffer containing NaCl (1 M), KCl (27 mM) and 15%
sucrose, before pelleting again with the same conditions. The
pellet was gently resuspended in 600 μL unbuffered
spheroplasting solution containing NaCl (1 M), KCl
(27 mM) and 15% sucrose, and 200 μL transferred to a clean,
2-mL round-bottomed tube for each transformation. 0.5 M
EDTA, pH 8.0 (20 μL), was added to the side of the tube,
inverted to mix and left for 10 min at room temperature. DNA
samples were prepared with 10 μL pTA228/BC61-TAm plas-
mid (~ 1 μg), unbuffered spheroplasting solution (15 μL) and
0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 (5 μL). This mixture was added to the
cell suspension as described before and left for 5 min at room
temperature. An equal volume of 60% PEG
600 in unbuffered
spheroplasting solution was added in the same manner as be-
fore, the tube shaken horizontally to mix and left for 30 min at
room temperature. The mixture was diluted with 1.5 mL sphe-
roplast dilution solution (Nuttall et al. 2009), inverted to mix
and left for 2 min at room temperature, before pelleting at
6000 rpm for 8 min. The supernatant was discarded and
1m Lr e g e n e r a t i o ns o l u t i o n( N u t t a l le ta l .2009) was added,
with a wide-bore pipette used to transfer the pellet and solu-
tion to a 5-mL sterile tube. This was incubated undisturbed at
45 °C for 2 h, before leaving for a further 4 h with rotation.
Following incubation, cells were transferred to a 2-mL round-
bottomed tube and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 8 min, with the
resultant pellet resuspended in 1 mL transformant dilution
solution (Nuttall et al. 2009). Suspensions were diluted further
to 10
−1 and 10−2 with transformant dilution solution and plat-
ed on Hv-Ca+ agar (Nuttall et al. 2009) and incubated at
45 °C. After around 1 week, colonies were restreaked on
Hv-Ca+ agar for purity, with fresh colonies used to inoculate
5 mL Hv-Ca+ broth and incubated at 45 °C with rotation.
Protein expression was carried out based on an adapted meth-
od described previously (Liliensiek et al. 2013). When prima-
ry cultures reached OD 550 ≈ 1.0, they were used to inoculate
1 L Hv-YPC broth (Allers et al. 2004) containing 5 mM L-
tryptophan and incubated at 45 °C with rotation to an OD 550 ≈
1.0. Following incubation, the culture was pelleted via centri-
fugation, freeze-thawed at − 80 °C, suspended in 50 mM Tris-
HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 2 M NaCl and 2 mM EDTA,
and sonicated on ice. This was further centrifuged to remove
cell debris. The supernatant was clarified using 0.8 μMf i l t e r s
and purified as described below.
His-tag-mediated purification and expression analysis
of BC61-TAm protein
BC61-TAm protein was purified from clarified cell-free ex-
tract (CFE) by immobilised metal affinity chromatography
(IMAC) using the N-terminal 6× His-tag encoded by the
pTA1228 vector. An ÄKTA Prime Plus Liquid
Chromatography System was used to load the CFE on a
HisTrap ™ HP 1 mL column (both GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, UK) at a rate of 1 mL min −1. This was washed using
buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole, 1 mM PMSF made up to 1 L with dH
2O. Purified
protein was eluted in 1 mL fractions using buffer containing
20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 1 mM
PMSF adjusted to 1 L with dH 2O. Recombinant BC61-TAm
protein was analysed via SDS-PAGE.
HPLC-based screening assay employing ( R)
-methylbenzylamine as amino donor
(R)-Methylbenzylamine (MBA) (25 mM) and PLP
(0.5 mM in potassium phosphate buffer, 100 mM,
pH 8.0, 2 M KCl), and α-ketoglutarate ( α-KG) (5 mM)
were added to a 96-well deep well plate to give a total
volume of 180 μL. The reaction was initiated by the ad-
dition of 20 μL purified BC61-TAm to a final working
concentration of 1 mg/mL. After incubation for 16 h at
45 °C and 1200 rpm, the reaction was quenched with
800 μL 62.5% acetonitrile and denatured protein was re-
moved by centrifugation. Two hundred microlitres of su-
pernatant was removed for analysis by HPLC using an
XSelect® CSH ™ C18 5 μM column (4.6 × 250 mm)
and an Agilent 1260 Infinity model. Detection of
acetophenone coproduct was carried out at 240 nm, in
an adaptation of a previously described study (Schätzle
et al. 2009). The concentration of acetophenone coproduct
formation was determined over 11 min using a gradient of
5–95% organic solvent (where A = dH
2Ow i t h0 . 1 %
H3 PO 4 and B = acetonitrile with 0.1% H 3 PO 4 ).
Acetophenone eluted at a retention time of 8.6 min.
Assays using both BC61-TAm and elution buffer negative
Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103:5727 –5737 5729
controls were carried out in triplicate for each substrate,
with an average conversion taken for each and values for
negative control subtracted from BC61-TAm values.
To assess the effect of temperature on enzyme perfor-
mance, assays were set up as described above but incubated
at different temperatures, ranging from 30 to 60 °C.
To assess the effect of changing pH on enzyme perfor-
mance, assays were set up using a universal buffer (Davies
1959), containing 25 mM citric acid, 25 mM KH
2PO4,2 5m M
Tris, 12.5 mM Na 2B4O7 and 2 M KCl, adjusted using NaOH,
with pH values from pH 6.0 to 11.0 investigated.
To assess the effect of organic solvents on enzyme perfor-
mance, more concentrated stock solutions of potassium phos-
phate buffer (pH 8.0) were prepared to reduce the aqueous
volume in the reaction, with PLP concentrations also adjusted
in buffer solutions accordingly. Once diluted by the required
amount of organic solvent, the overall concentrations of po-
tassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), PLP and KC1 in solution
remained at 100 mM, 0.5 mM and 2 M as before.
Concentrations of organic solvents investigated ranged from
0t o3 0 % .
Kinetic parameters were determined using the reaction de-
scribed above, with α-KG concentration varied from 1 to
20 mM and amino donor concentration maintained at 5 equiv-
alents for each reaction. KCl and DMF concentrations were
1 M and 30% respectively, with each reaction carried out in
triplicate. Reactions were quenched with 800 μL 62.5% ace-
tonitrile at regular time intervals and denatured protein was
removed by centrifugation. The concentration of
acetophenone coproduct formation was determined as de-
scribed above. BC61-TAm concentration was determined
using a combination of a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer
(Invitrogen, UK) and SDS-PAGE densitometry.
Molecular modelling and substrate docking
Molecular models of BC61-TAm were constructed using the
I-TASSER server ( https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-
TASSER) followed by energy minimisation using Yasara
(Krieger et al. 2009). Molecular models of PMP and α-KG
were constructed in Ascalaph Designer and subject to 1000
steps of steepest descent energy minimisation. The fidelity of
the BC61-TAm model was assessed using the tools of the
Whatif server along with Ramachandran analysis. Molecular
models and docked complexes were viewed and manipulated
in PyMol (DeLano 2002).
AutoDock Vina was utilised for the docking of both
PMP and α-KG in two separate docking events (Trott
and Olson 2010). Yasara energy minimisation was con-
ducted following each docking step resulting in the pro-
duction of the final docked complex. Construction of res-
idue interaction maps was carried out using LigPlus
followed by visualisation in PyMol.
Molecular dynamics simulations
Hydrogen atoms were added to simulated systems accord-
ing to protonation states of individual residues with
protonatable side chains at physiological pH following
pKa analysis using PROPKA (Rostkowski et al. 2011). A
molecule of DMF was constructed within Ascalaph
Designer and subject to 1000 steps of steepest descent en-
ergy minimisation. Parameterisation of DMF was carried
out using the PRODG server and a compatible GROMOS
topology subsequently produced (Schüttelkopf and Van
Aalten 2004).
All proteins were immersed within truncated octahedral
boxes of explicit solvent (TIP3P water) with a minimum
clearance of 20 Å between periodic images for starting
configurations. Solvent mo lecules were replaced with
2433 molecules of DMF to leave a final concentration
of 30% in DMF simulations. The GROMOS96 54a7 force
field was utilised for all simulations. Solvent molecules
were replaced with Na
+ and Cl − ions to neutralise all
charges and leave a final physiological concentration of
100 mM by using the genion facility of Gromacs v4.6.5
(Hess et al. 2008).
Steepest descent energy minimisation was carried out on
all simulations with an energy step of 0.01, until a maxi-
mum potential force of < 1000 kJ Mol −1 was achieved. The
Verlet cutoff scheme was utilised with particle mesh Ewald
(PME) treatment of electrostat ic interactions (Grubmüller
et al. 1991;D a r d e ne ta l . 1993). Energy, pressure and tem-
perature were monitored for the entirety of the simulation
set up. NVT equilibration was carried out for 100 ps with a
2-fs integration step. The LINCS algorithm with holonomic
constraints was used to constrain all bonds (Hess et al.
1997). PME was implemented for long-range electrostatics
with a 9 Å cutoff for the real-space term and non-bonded
Van der Waals interactions were calculated using Lennard-
Jones 12-6 potentials with a 9 Å cutoff. Velocities were
derived from a Maxwell distribution. A similar set up was
used for a subsequent NPT equilibration with Parrinello-
Rahman pressure coupling implemented (Parrinello and
Rahman 1980). Periodic boundary conditions were used
for the systems with cutoff radii of 1 nm. Systems then
underwent simulation for a total time of 10 ns with 2-fs
integration time. Coordinates were saved every 10 ps.
Triplicate simulations were conducted for both BC61-
TAm in water and in 30% DMF and were run on the high
performance computing cluster at Queen ’s University
Belfast.
Analysis of system properties was conducted using in-
trinsic tools of Gromacs v4.6.5 along with Chimera and
PyMol for the manipulation of models and their subse-
quent visualisation. Graphs were subsequently produced
within the R programming language.

BC61-TAm gene and protein sequences
BC61-TAm sequence data was deposited using the BankIt
sequence submission tool. Gene sequence data can be found
in the GenBank database with Accession Number
MK248484.1 and protein sequence data can be found in the
GenPept database with Accession Number AZS32940.1.
Results
Organism identification and gene selection
The organism, from which the TAm enzyme was cloned and
expressed, was isolated from a brine sample from Kilroot salt
mine and given the designation CSM-61. Using the BLASTn
function of the NCBI database, the organism was found to be
a member of the genus Halorubrum, with the closest neigh-
bour deemed to be Halorubrum saccharovorum JCM 8865.
On uploading the assembled contigs from Whole Genome
Sequencing data to the RAST server (Aziz et al. 2008), the
subsystems search tool revealed 19 results using the search
term ‘aminotransferase ’. The gene chosen was 930 bp in
length and the corresponding protein was given the designa-
tion BC61-TAm.
Expression and phylogenetic analysis
SDS-PAGE analysis following IMAC purification showed a
34–35-kDa protein, commensurate with gene length and pre-
dicted size from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Using a
BLASTp search of the NCBI database, the closest neighbour
to BC61-TAm was deemed to be a BCAT (fold type IVof the
PLP superfamily), from Halorubrum sp. (Hp-TAm), at 94%
identity (NCBI Reference Sequence WP_099256159.1).
The phylogeny of BC61-TAm was investigated along-
side a number of previously described TAms. Sequences
were selected from both PLP fold types I and IV for
comparison. PLP fold type I enzymes included ( S)-selec-
tive ω-TAms from mesophilic bacteria (Vf-TAm from
Vibrio fluvialis (PDB: 3NUI_A), Cv-TAm from
Chromobacterium violaceum (NCBI Reference
Sequence: WP_011135573.1), Pp-TAm from
Pseudomonas putida (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P28269.1))
and halophilic bacteria (Hs-TAm from Halomonas sp.
(GenBank: KUJ87738.1) and Ad2-TAm (Kelly et al.
2017)). PLP fold type IV enzymes included ( R)-selective
ω-TAms (Arth-TAm from Arthrobacter sp. KNK168
(Genbank: BAK39753.1) and At-TAm from Aspergillus
terreus (PDB: 4CE5_B)) and BCATs from both
mesophilic bacteria (Ec-TAm from E. coli (PDB:
1IYE_A)) and haloarchaea (Hp-TAm) (Fig. 2).
BC61-TAm contained a higher proportion of the acidic
amino acids, aspartate and glutamate (19.42%), versus
those from the mesophilic bacterial TAms, Cv-TAm, Pp-
TAm, Vf-TAm, Ec-TAm, and Arth-TAm (12.21%). The
overall proportion of lysine residues was lower in BC61-
TAm at 1.94% than with the same mesophilic bacterial
TAms at 3.96%.
Evaluation of enzyme performance under varying
reaction parameters
BC61-TAm was shown to be an ( R)-selective TAm with
its ability to utilise ( R)-MBA as an amino donor, whilst
not accepting the ( S)-isomer. For both NaCl and KCl,
conversion of α-KG improved with the addition of salt
to the reaction versus no salt, with 100% relative con-
version seen at 1 M for both salts. Conversions remained
high with increasing salinities beyond 1 M, with 95.4,
91.9 and 63.8% relative conversions observed for 2, 3
and 4 M NaCl respectively, relative to the conversion
seen at 1 M (Fig. 3a).
BC61-TAm performed well in a number of scenarios
with increasing levels of organic solvent (Fig. 3b).
Greatest overall conversions were seen with 30% DMF

in the reaction mix, although BC61-TAm also performed
well when the reaction was supplemented with DMSO.
Optimal conversion in the BC61-TAm-catalysed reaction
was observed at 50 °C (Fig. 3c) and pH 8.0 (Fig. 3d).
Despite being annotated as a BCAT, BC61-TAm was
able to produce 17.4% conversion of α-KG using ( R)-
MBA as amino donor, with a specific activity of
73.22 U/mg, where one unit is defined as the amount
of enzyme producing 1 nmol of acetophenone per
minute. Km was determined as 3.37 mM and kcat as
2.52 min
−1.
Modelling and molecular dynamics of BC61-TAm
The primary template utilised for the threading process of the
BC61-TAm model was the PDB entry 6NST. Ramachandran
analysis of the finalised BC61-TAm model revealed that
95.1% of residues lie within favoured regions, with none in

formation measured at 240 nm.

deviation. In each graph,

ed in the production of a predicted final complex (Fig. 4a).
LigPlus analysis of the bound complex revealed a number of
residue interactions, including contributions by K161, which
is a likely candidate for catalysis in the transamination reaction
(Fig. 4b).
In an attempt to elucidate potential explanations for solvent
enhanced activity, the BC61-TAm model was subject to mo-
lecular dynamics simulations in both water and 30% DMF.

reveals a similar flexibility profile is conserved across all res-
idues in the water and DMF simulations, suggesting similar
movement profiles. However, in the DMF simulations, there
is increased flexibility compared with that of water alone
(Fig. 5a).
The solvation shell surrounding BC61-TAm was simulated
in both water and 30% DMF systems, and water molecules
were coloured according to a blue/white/red scheme corre-
sponding to increasing density (Fig. 5c, d). In the water only
simulation, a universal distribution of water molecules around
the protein is observed. Disruption of the solvation shell in
comparison with the water-only simulation is apparent, but by
far the highest level of water density is observed in the active
site cavity. The DMF also appears to contribute to this solva-
tion shell (Online Resource - Fig. S2). The number of hydro-
gen bonds over time is also calculated for these simulations.
When the lower number of water molecules in the DMF sim-
ulations is accounted for, the total number of bonds is not
significantly different between the two (Fig. 5b ).
Additionally, analysis of the solvent accessible surface area
(SASA) reveals that the DMF simulations possess a higher
total SASA than the water-only simulations (Online
Resource - Fig. S3).
Discussion
Of the 19 results obtained using the search term ‘aminotrans-
ferase’, those belonging to PLP fold types I and IV were
selected for further study, as they are known to be industrially
relevant (Steffen-Munsberg et al. 2015) .T h eg e n ec o d i n gf o r
BC61-TAm was annotated as a ‘branched-chain amino acid
aminotransferase’ (BCAT). Following cloning and expres-
sion, this produced an active protein and was characterised
further. As expected, phylogenetic analysis grouped BC61-
TAm with PLP fold type IV proteins, and was most closely
related to the BCATs (Fig. 2). Residue analysis revealed a
considerably higher proportion of the acidic amino acids, as-
partate and glutamate, contained within BC61-TAm versus
those from the mesophilic bacterial TAms. A greater number
of acidic residues on the protein surface is characteristic of
haloarchaeal enzymes, with the additional carboxyl group
allowing a hydration shell to be stabilised in highly ionic sur-
roundings, thereby maintaining the protein’s solubility at high
salinity (Madern et al. 1995; Madigan and Oren 1999;H o u g h
and Danson 1999). Conversely, numbers of basic lysine

residues are decreased at the protein ’s surface (Danson and
Hough 1997; DasSarma and DasSarma 2015). This was also
proven to be the case with BC61-TAm when compared with
mesophilic TAms.
Although annotated as a BCAT, which utilise branched-
chain amino acids as amino donors, BC61-TAm also accepted
MBA as amino donor. The ability of BCATs to accept amines
as amino group donors has been reported previously in bacte-
rial TAms (Kim et al. 2018), but such a phenomenon has not
been described in the archaea. TAms possessing both BCAT
and ω-TAm activity can be attributed to the common ancestry
shared among PLP fold type IVenzymes (Pavkov-Keller et al.
2016; Kim et al. 2018). Such a relationship is exemplified by
the ( R)-selective ω-TAms, Arth-TAm and At-TAm, and the
BCATs, Ec-TAm, Hp-TAm, and BC61-TAm, shown in Fig.2.
BC61-TAm was shown to be an ( R)-selective TAm with its
ability to utilise (R )-MBA as an amino donor, whilst not
accepting the ( S)-isomer. This is a key characteristic of
BC61-TAm, given the relative paucity of ( R)-selective
enzymes in the current toolbox and the need for optical purity
in many pharmaceuticals.
BC61-TAm displayed a typically halophilic profile when
tested over a range of salinities, in that conversion improved
with the addition of salt and high relative conversions were
still observed up to 4 M NaCl. The solvent tolerance exhibited
represents a valuable feature of this enzyme and is character-
istic of haloarchaeal enzymes as a whole. This trait also high-
lights the applicability of BC61-TAm, and similar enzymes, in
processes requiring a high concentration of co-solvent, as of-
ten seen when substrate solubility is poor.
The usefulness of BC61-TAm is further exemplified by
its preference for temperatures beyond the mesophilic
range, with optimal conversion seen at 50 °C. Halophile-
derived enzymes are known to be thermotolerant and, com-
bined with tolerance to organic solvents, possess a profile
which could prove extremely advantageous in a number of
harsh reaction processes where mesophilic enzymes would
fail to function.

Unlike a number of enzymes from halophiles, which also
possess an alkaliphilic profile, the optimal pH for BC61-TAm
was pH 8.0 (Fig. 3d). This could be explained by BC61-
TAm’s thalassohaline source, an environment formed from
the evaporation of seawater, whereas alkaliphilic halophiles
often derive from soda lakes and perform optimally at pH 9 –
10 (Hough and Danson 1999).
BC61-TAm was investigated for its ability to aminate a
range of diverse aldehyde and ketone substrates, but of the
compounds tested, it was only active against α-KG. Despite
this limited substrate scope, BC61-TAm shows desirable char-
acteristics for industrial applications in its current form, par-
ticularly with respect to its tolerance to salt, organic solvent
and increasing temperature, as well as being an ( R)-selective
TAm. In this regard, BC61-TAm represents a superb potential
scaffold to which rational design can be applied in order to
produce robust, novel biocatalysts.
Residues shown in the ligand map (Fig. 4b) reflect those of
previously reported bacterial BCATs. Structural comparisons
and searches revealed equivalent residues for all positions
(Goto et al. 2003;D eC h e ne ta l . 2012), suggesting BC61-
TAm likely mediates catalysis according to a typical bacterial
TAm pathway. This also suggests haloarchaeal TAms could
provide effective scaffolds for rational design, as beneficial
amino acid substitutions already known for bacterial TAms
should confer the same advantages on TAms from
haloarchaea. It is likely that the catalytic pathway of transam-
ination has been conserved in BC61-TAm and has been
coupled with the ability to not only tolerate solvents, but be
enhanced by the presence of some organic solvents.
Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a number of in-
sights into the improved performance of BC61-TAm in the
presence of organic solvent. RMSF simulations showed in-
creased flexibility across individual residues in the 30%
DMF simulation compared to water alone. Organic solvents
often confer a rigidifying effect on mesophilic proteins, but
the increased flexibility observed with BC61-TAm may par-
tially account for the improvement in conversion observed in
the presence of DMF.
The hydration shell of a protein is critical to its func-
tion, with solvent-mediated disruption of this shell some-
what accounting for the typical rigidity and loss of func-
tion associated with most proteins. It seems that in the
DMF simulations, BC61-TAm is able to retain a high
density of water molecules within the active site cavity,
a likely factor in the preservation of its activity despite the
presence of solvent. This, along with DMF-mediated in-
teractions, appears to provide a modified water solvent
shell that imparts greate r flexibility on BC61-TAm.
Furthermore, the higher total SASA in the DMF simula-
tion appears to be due to an increased hydrophobic con-
tribution, likely attributable to the DMF. Along with the
likely increase in substrate solubility provided by DMF,
this provides a feasible mechanistic explanation as to the
higher experimental activity observed.
To our knowledge, BC61-TAm is the first haloarchaeal TAm
to be studied and characterised for biocatalytic application.
BC61-TAm is (R)-selective and displays a number of adapta-
tions which could prove useful in industrial processes, including
thermotolerance, halophilicity and tolerance to organic solvents.
Molecular dynamics simulations have predicted a number of
mechanisms by which BC61-TAm exhibits solvent tolerance,
a characteristic of particular interest in pharmaceutical biocatal-
ysis. We therefore propose that BC61-TAm can serve as a useful
first example of an organic solvent-tolerant, halophilic ( R)-se-
lective archaeal TAm, whose characteristics can help provide a
scaffold for future biocatalys
t mining and protein engineering.
