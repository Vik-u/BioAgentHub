Imine reductases (IREDs) are NADPH-dependent enzymes with
significant biocatalytic potential for the synthesis of primary,
secondary, and tertiary chiral amines. Their applications include
the reduction of cyclic imines and the reductive amination of
prochiral ketones. In this study, twenty-nine novel IREDs were
revealed through genome mining. Imine reductase activities
were screened at pH 7 and 9 and in presence of either NADPH
or NADH; some IREDs showed good activities at both pHs and
were able to accept both cofactors. IREDs with Asn and Glu at
the key 187 residue showed preference for NADH. IREDs were
also screened against a series of dihydroisoquinolines to
synthesise tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs), bioactive alkaloids
with a wide range of therapeutic properties. Selected IREDs
showed high stereoselectivity, as well high THIQ yields (> 90 %)
when coupled to a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for
NADPH cofactor recycling.
Introduction
Chiral amines play an important role in the synthesis of
bioactive compounds for the fine chemical, pharmaceutical and
agrochemical industries and it is estimated that around 40 % of
pharmaceutical drugs contain a chiral amine component in
their structure.
[1]
Due to the high stereoselectivities that can be
achieved, several sustainable biocatalytic routes are currently
used in industrial processes for chiral amine synthesis involving
biocatalysts such as lipases,
[2]
transaminases,
[3]
ammonia
lyases,
[4]
amine dehydrogenases
[5]
and amine oxidases.
[6]
Imine
reductases (IREDs) are a relatively new group of enzymes that
were first reported in 2010 for reduction of the imine 2-methyl-
1-pyrroline into (R) or (S)-2-methylpyrrolidine.
[7]
IREDs belong to
the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme class and have
a preference for the reduction of cyclic imines into chiral amines
(Scheme 1a).
[8,9]
They are less efficient at achieving the inter-
molecular reductive amination of prochiral ketones with amines
but recently a subclass of IREDs, reductive aminases (RedAms),
have been reported to convert these via imines into the
respective amines (Scheme 1b).
[10]
In addition, it has also been
reported that IREDs can catalyse the kinetic resolution of chiral
secondary amines in the presence of NADP
+
at high pH
values.
[11]
For these reasons, IREDs are considered promising
and powerful biocatalysts for the synthesis of a broad range of
chiral primary, secondary and tertiary amine products; and a
valuable alternative to other biocatalysts currently used for this
purpose.
Traditional synthetic routes to access the same products
afforded by IRED-catalysed reactions can be challenging to
achieve in high stereoselectivities, and reduction of the
carbonyl group can lead to side products. The use of
biocatalysis therefore offers an exciting opportunity for industri-
al-scale chiral amine syntheses. However, some drawbacks for
the wider application of IREDs remain such as poor activity, low
stability, and narrow substrate specificity (especially (R)-selective
IREDs).
[12,13]
Recently, significant effort has been made to
discover new IREDs from plants, bacteria and fungi,
[14–17]
as well
as from metagenomes,
[18–20]
together with studies to better

understand this enzyme class from a structural, mechanistic and
biochemical perspective.
Recent reviews have highlighted the application of IREDs in
the synthesis of several drugs and pharmaceutical intermedi-
ates, including alkaloids such as tetrahydroisoquinolines
(THIQs).
[21,22]
Many THIQs are naturally synthesised by plants and
the scaffold has an important role in medicinal chemistry due
to the wide range of pharmacological properties exhibited,
such as anti-HIV, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and use as
bronchodilators and antibiotics.
[23–26]
Different biocatalytic
routes to access THIQs have been studied using monoamine
oxidases, norcoclaurine synthases and the berberine bridge
enzyme.
[22–28]
IREDs have been described for the asymmetric
reduction of dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) to chiral THIQs, being
more advantageous compared to chemical reduction methods
where enantioselectivity and cost still remain challenging.
[29–31]
This work aims to expand the number of IREDs through a
genome mining approach from nine bacterial strains; their IRED
activities were screened against 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, cyclo-
hexanone and 2-hexanone together with methylamine, at pH 7
and 9, and in presence of NADPH and NADH. In addition, IRED
activity on DHIQs towards THIQs synthesis was examined, and
to increase THIQ reaction yields, selected IREDs were coupled
with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for cofac-
tor recycling.
Results and Discussion
Uncovering novel IREDs
IREDs were mined from nine different microorganisms mainly
from the Streptomyces genus. IREDs are mainly found in these
strains, which is associated with their ability to produce various
secondary metabolites such as antibiotics, peptides, pigments
and bioherbicides, that contain amine functional groups.
[32]
Protein sequences of putative (S)- and (R)-IREDs were retrieved
from BLASTp using the sequence of an IRED from S.
kanamyceticus as a model protein (Uniprot Q1EQE0)
[33]
against
the whole genome of the specific microorganism.
Sequences were then confirmed by identifying two IRED-
specific motifs: first, the NADPH-cofactor binding motif
GLGxMGx5[ATS]x4Gx4[VIL]WNR[TS]x2[KR]; and second, the ac-
tive site motif Gx[DE]x[GDA]x[APS]x3{K}x[ASL]x[LMVIAG]. Se-
quences with N191 were excluded as being one of the major
determinants that differentiate IREDs from β-hydroxyacid
dehydrogenases.
[34]
Twenty-nine IREDs were uncovered follow-
ing this in silico strategy, then cloned via our one-pot
restriction-ligation reaction method
[35]
using E. coli BL21(DE3) or
E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) as the expression host (see Materials and
Methods). pQR numbers (the Ward group plasmid identifier)
were consecutively assigned from pQR2595 to pQR2623 (see
protein IDs in Supporting Information).
IREDs sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Multiple sequence alignment of the IREDs was performed using
the Clustal Omega online tool, including protein sequences of
well-characterised IREDs with known stereoselectivities: (R)-
IRED_Skan (set as numbering reference), (R)-IRED_Aory (Asper-
gillus oryzae, Q2TW47) and (S)-IRED_Pelg (Paenibacillus elgii,
WP_010497949.1) (Figure 1). The sequence similarity of the
IREDs ranged from 29 % to 71 % . Regarding the cofactor
binding site, all IREDs contained a full-length Rossmann-fold
domain GxGxxG consensus sequence and a highly conserved
VWNR sequence (except pQR2619 with IWNR) (Figure 1). Key
amino acid residues in the active site, D187 or Y187, are
associated with the (R)- and (S)-stereoselectivity, respectively;
although this in not fully understood until now.
[17]
Twenty-one
IREDs had one of these residues in this position, whilst some
IREDs showed either E187 (pQR2596, 2610, 2616 and 2622) or
N187 (pQR2603, 2606, 2614 and 2619) (Figure 1). The presence
of E187 has been reported previously, with this residue acting
as a proton donor during catalysis (similar to D187); however,
N187 is not commonly found in IREDs. In fact, IREDs can be
grouped based on this amino acid residue, as depicted in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), with E187 being more closely
related to the D187 subgroup, and N187 related to the Y187
subgroup.
In addition, an interesting amino acid conservation pattern
was observed in position 196 that is coincidentally found in
each subgroup in the phylogenetic tree, which allows us to
sub-divide these IREDs into 8 additional subgroups, as
summarised in Table 1. The D187 subgroup (pQR2598, 2600,
2604, 2608 and 2611) including (R)-IRED_Aory (first RedAm to
be reported)
[15]
has a highly conserved G196; all Y187 (except
pQR2607) and some D187 IREDs (subgroup pQR2609, 2612,
2615, 2620 and 2621), are closely related and show a conserved
T196. Likewise, E187 and N187 show highly conserved P196
and A196, respectively; the remaining D187 IREDs (pQR2595,
2601 and IRED_Skan) show conserved S196, except pQR2618
with G199 and pQR2602 with A196.
Moreover, N108 was highly conserved amongst all these
IREDs except for E187 IREDs containing T108 instead. These
specific amino acid residues might play a significant role either
in stereoselectivity or activity; however, this is beyond the aim
of our study and would need to be proved experimentally.

IREDs activity screening
Recombinant IREDs were placed in a 96-well plate format (in
duplicate), and enzymes were expressed. Most IREDs showed
good expression levels in the soluble fraction (see SDS-PAGE
analysis in Supporting Information). IRED activities were
screened (as clarified lysates) against model compound sub-
strates: 2-methyl-1-pyrroline to test imine reductase activity
(IRED activity, Scheme 2a) and cyclohexanone or 2-hexanone
with methylamine as amino donor (1 : 8 eq.) to test reductive
aminase activity (RedAm activity, Scheme 2b and 2c); all at pH 7
and 9 and in the presence of either NADPH or NADH.
A summary of the results is shown in Scheme 2d as a heat
map based on the comparison of initial rates calculated
following cofactor consumption, using empty plasmid-clarified
lysate and free-clarified lysate reaction as controls. IREDs
belonging to the D187   G196 subgroup showed modest to
good expression levels; remarkably, pQR2598, 2600 and 2611
were highly active showing a broad range of activity with all
substrates, cofactors and at both pH values; however, pQR2604,
2608 and 2618 showed poor activity levels for all substrates and
conditions; therefore, we can infer that IREDs broad activity
cannot be associated to these particular amino acid residue
subgroups. IRED pQR2602 (D187   A196 sub-group) showed also
similar broad activity. Only three IREDs (pQR2603, 2608 and
2621) showed extremely poor or no activity, which might be
due to low expression levels or lack of appropriate substrates.
The remaining IREDs expressed well but showed variable
activity under the experimental conditions. Hence, based on
our screening results, and in agreement with previous publica-
tions, IRED activity-specificity is highly substrate and cofactor
dependent, and cannot easily be associated to a specific
subgroup or sequence motif.
Most IREDs described to date have a natural preference for
NADPH;

showed also a preference for NADPH at pH 7. RedAm activity is
usually observed in some IREDs, which is favoured in the
presence of an excess of the amine donor (8 eq. in this work)
and at pH 9. Here, RedAm activity with cyclohexanone was
higher in the presence of NADPH; and on average, greater at
pH 9 for most of the IREDs evaluated. In addition, “true”
RedAms, an IREDs subset, can catalyse the reductive amination
of prochiral ketones with equimolar concentrations of the
amine donor and at pH 7;
[10,21]
although these conditions were
not tested in this study, from the phylogenetic perspective,
pQR2598, 2600 and 2608 are more closely related to (R)-IRED_
Aory (first “true” RedAm described);
[10]
however, based on our
data, it is unclear if these IREDs are “true” RedAms, and this will
be explored in the future.
IRED-catalysed reactions with NADH as the cofactor would
be advantageous as this cofactor is more stable and cheaper
than NADPH, and it is also easier to regenerate enzymatically
for applications at a large scale.
[13]
Three IREDs (pQR2600, 2601
and 2602; all from different subgroups) showed good IRED and
RedAm activities, able to almost equally accept NADH. In this
respect, Borlinghaus et al. reported an alteration of cofactor
specificity for (R)-IRED_Ms (Mixococcus stipitatus) achieving a
2900-fold improved NADH/NADPH specificity and enhanced
activity for the reduction of 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, concluding
that the key amino acid residues for NADH specificity are R50Y
(R33Y in Ms) and particularly K54R (K37R in Ms).
[36]
All IREDs in this study have a conserved R50 (used as a
selection criteria), whilst only 13 and 16 IREDs contained K54
and R54, respectively (Figure 1). Remarkably, and in contrast to
previous findings, all the N187   A196 and E187   P196 IREDs
subgroups have K54 (associated with low NADH specificity) but
showed moderate to good activity with NADH as a cofactor for
the reduction reactions (except pQR2606 with good activities in
presence of NADPH). From this, we infer that E187 and N187
IREDs prefer NADH as cofactor; this may be associated not only
with residue 187 but also residues near the cofactor binding
site motif (position 54) and active site motif (position 196).
In addition, reductive aminase activity has mainly been
tested towards aromatic ketones with NADPH as the cofactor
and methylamine as the amine.
[37]
Our results show that most
IREDs had RedAm activity towards 2-cyclohexanone mainly in
presence of NADPH; however, and irrespective of the level of
activity, RedAm activity towards the aliphatic ketone 2-
hexanone was higher mainly in presence of NADH compared to
NADPH and on average the best activity was observed at pH 7
(Scheme 2d).

IREDs catalysed the synthesis of THIQs
THIQs are important scaffolds for the synthesis of active
pharmaceutical ingredients such as 1-methyl   THIQ, salsolidine
and solifenacin.
[29]
Here, the reduction of five aryl   DHIQs (1 a–
5 a, Scheme 3) into their respective THIQs (1 b–5 b) in the
presence of NADPH (1.2 eq.) was studied. IRED activity results
are shown in Scheme 3 as initial rates. It has previously been
reported that W195 plays an important role in DHIQ substrate
accommodation potentially causing steric hindrance and as an
explanation for the poor activity of IREDs, and this residue is
particularly critical for substrate binding in (S)-IREDs.
[30]
It has
also been shown that F194 is important for substrate accom-
modation for 6,7-dimethoxylated-aryl   DHIQs (2 a and 5 a in this
study); hence, a double mutant F194M   W195F showed up to
6.8-fold improvement in catalytic activity for this substrate
type.
[38]
In our study, the D187 IREDs associated to (R)-IRED_Aory
have a consensus M194 and Y/S/T/N195 residues; other D187
IREDs have low conservation for the 194 residue with either M/
F/C194, and highly conserved residue W195; these IREDs
subgroup were the most active towards the DHIQs evaluated.
The Y187 IREDs had a highly conserved F194   W/L195 showing
overall moderate activity, except pQR2599 and 2607, where
both were highly active towards 4 a. The E187 and N187 IREDs
contained highly conserved L194   L195 and M194   Y/W195,
respectively; both subgroups exhibited low activity towards the
DHIQs, this might be associated to these specific amino acid
residues and their preference for NADH to catalyse the imine
reduction.
In this work, four IREDs (pQR2595, 2600, 2601 and 2612)
were selected for the reduction of 1 a, 3 a, 4 a and 5 a into their
respective THIQs (Table 2). These IREDs belong to the D187
subgroup with a predicted (R)-stereoselectivity based on
sequence analysis. Activity towards 2 a was inconclusive as
most IREDs showed similar activity values (at around 0.01 μmol/
mLmin), and therefore this compound was not used further.
THIQ 4 b was difficult to synthesise chemically due to its high
instability, hence reaction yields were calculated based on 4 a
consumption. Most THIQ reaction yields after 24 h were
relatively low (21–44 %) except for 4 b which was catalysed by
pQR2600 (74 %). Interestingly, pQR2600 and 2601 accepted 1 a
but showed very low activity towards 3 a, which only differs by
Scheme 3. IREDs activity towards DHIQs 1 a–5 a for the synthesis of THIQs 1 b–5 b. Initial rates were calculated in duplicates after up to 2 h reaction: 20 μL of
clarified lysate was mixed with 180 μL of reaction mixture containing 1 a–5 a (1 mM), DMSO (2.5 % v/v) and NADPH (0.2 mM) in TRIS   HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7)
at 30 ° C.

the presence of a fluorine in the para position of the phenyl
group in 1 a; conversely, pQR2595 exhibited high activity
towards 3 a and poor activity towards 1 a.
NADPH cofactor recycling is a strategy widely used to
increase reaction yields and reduce process cost. In-situ NADPH
recycling was carried out by coupling IREDs reaction to a
G6PDH with glucose-6-phosphate as the co-substrate
[39]
(Scheme 4). As expected, this allowed us to significantly
increase THIQ reaction yields by 1.2- to 4.4-fold, reaching for
example 98 % of 1 b, catalysed by pQR2601 (Table 2).
Notably, pQR2595 and 2601 were highly stereoselective
with > 99 % (R)-3 b and (R)-1 b, respectively. Likewise, (R)-1 b
with a 93 % ee was obtained with pQR2600. For pQR2612, the
main product was (S)-5 b (> 99 % ee) in contrast to its predicted
stereoselectivity based on residue D187 (Table 2). IRED inverse
stereoselectivity has also been reported previously, although
this is not fully understood yet and it has been reported that
P139 and F194 are potentially better predictors of stereo-
selectivity other than only D/Y187.
[17]
Nevertheless, pQR2612
(with moderate activity towards model substrates) contains a
P139 and an unusual C194 (the sole member of our IRED panel
with a Cys in this position) (Figure 1). Several IREDs reported for
the reduction of aryl   DHIQs into their respective aryl   THIQs are
(S)-selective, which have been described to be more tolerant
towards bulkier substrates.
[22]
Some (R)-selective IREDs able to
reduce aryl   DHIQs have been also reported but their substrate
scope is more limited.
[30]
Conclusions
IREDs are promising biocatalysts for the synthesis of primary,
secondary, and tertiary chiral amines. Based on the phyloge-
netic analysis of the identified IREDs, they were grouped into
four subgroups based on amino acid residue 187, with Asp, Tyr,
Glu or Asn in this key position. Here, in agreement with
previously reported work, IRED sequence-activity relationships
are highly substrate dependent, and activity cannot be limited
to any subgroup or sequence motif. Most of the twenty-nine
novel IREDs identified here expressed well. The majority showed
one or more type of activity (IRED and RedAm), with a
preference for NADPH as the cofactor. However, three IREDs
were able to accept both NADPH and NADH. Remarkably, E/
N187 IRED subgroups showed good activity and preference for
NADH, which is advantageous from a process and cost
perspective. In addition, reductive aminase activity towards 2-
hexanone was favoured mainly in the presence of NADH, which
needs to be investigated further. Four selected IREDs were also
applied in the synthesis of relevant THIQs, where coupling this
reaction to a G6PDH cofactor recycling system significantly
improved reaction yields, of up to 98 %. Although the stereo-
selectivity of IREDs is not fully understood yet; here, three
selected IREDs matched the predicted stereoselectivity based
on sequence analysis; however, one IRED showed inverse
stereoselectivity which cannot be fully explained at this stage.

NovaBlue (propagation strain); then, confirmed plasmids containing
genes of interest were transformed into chemically competent E.
coli BL21(DE3) or E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) (expression strain). All
recombinant IREDs have a C-terminal His
6
Tag.
Enzymes expression and cell lysis
Twenty-nine IREDs were selected (pQR2595-2623) for further
expression and activity screening experiments. They were put in a
96-deep-well plate (position from A1 to C5) in duplicate (position
from D1 to F5), including E. coli BL21(DE3) with empty pET29a + as
negative control (C6 and F6). Expression was with 1 mL of TB-broth
per well with kanamycin 50 μg/mL at 37 ° C and 1200 rpm in a
Thermomixer™ C (Eppendorf, UK), IPTG induction (0.5 mM final
concentration) to an OD
600nm
~ 1.5 and the temperature was then
reduced to 25 ° C for 15 h. The plate containing IREDs was then
centrifuged (4500 rpm at 4 ° C for 30 min) and cell pellets were
resuspended in 0.2 mL of 50 mM TRIS   HCl buffer pH 7. Cells were
disrupted by partially submerging the IRED-plate in a water bath
sonicator (Bransonic 2800 CPX2800H-E, Branson) as previously
described.
[40]
The clarified lysates were recovered in a fresh 96-well
plate and kept at 4 ° C for enzymatic activity screening and protein
quantification.

Activity screening assay
Enzymatic kinetic assays were performed for substrate screening,
using 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (10 mM) for IRED activity, and cyclo-
hexanone or 2-hexanone (20 mM) with methylamine (160 mM) as
amine donor for RedAm activity. All reactions were performed
mixing 20 μL of clarified lysate with 180 μL of reaction mixture
containing substrates and either NADPH or NADH (0.2 mM) in
TRIS   HCl buffer (50 mM) adjusted to pH 7 or 9 and incubated at
30 ° C. NADPH/NADH depletion was monitored at 340 nm for up to
30 min in a plate reader (CLARIOstar Plus, BMG Labtech) and the
initial rates (μmol/mLmin) were then calculated by using ɛNAD(P)H

. Additional control reactions were per-
formed following the above procedure using empty plasmid-
clarified lysate and free-clarified lysate reaction as controls. IREDs
activity was calculated by subtracting their activity values minus
activity of controls. All screening reactions were performed in
duplicate.
THIQs enzyme screening and synthesis
Initial IRED activity for THIQs synthesis was performed as described
in the Activity screening assay section. DHIQs and THIQs were all
chemically synthesised in our Lab (except DHIQ-1 b which was
purchased from Fluorochem); their synthesis and characterization is
shown in the Supporting Information. For the reactions, 20 μL of
clarified lysate was mixed with 180 μL of reaction mixture
containing DHIQ 1 a–5 a (1 mM), DMSO (2.5 % v/v) and NADPH
(0.2 mM) in TRIS   HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7) and incubated in the
plate reader for up to 2 h at 30 ° C. Then initial rates were calculated
using control reactions as explained above. Small-scale THIQ
syntheses (1 mL) were performed with selected IREDs and respec-
tive DHIQs. Reaction mixtures contained IRED clarified lysate
(20 % v/v), DHIQ (2.5 mM), DMSO (2.5 % v/v) and NADPH (3 mM,
1.2 eq.) in TRIS   HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7) and were incubated at
30 ° C for up to 24 h in Thermomixer™ C.
In order to improve reaction yields and reduce cofactor utilisation,
IRED reactions were coupled with G6PDH.
[39]
One mL of reaction
mixture contained selected IRED and G6PDH clarified lysates
(20 % v/v of each), DHIQ (2.5 mM), DMSO (2.5 % v/v), NADP
+
(0.5 mM), glucose-6-phosphate (20 mM) in TRIS   HCl buffer (50 mM,
pH 7) and incubated at 30 ° C for up to 24 h in Thermomixer™ C.
All bioconversion reactions were conducted in duplicate. Reactions
were quenched by adding 1 volume of 0.5 % TFA (v/v in milliQ
water), samples were centrifuged (10000 rpm at 4 ° C for 15 min)
and the supernatants were analysed by HPLC.
DHIQ and THIQ analyses
The amounts of DHIQs and THIQs were quantified by HPLC with an
Ultimate 3000 + UHPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific) fitted with an
ACE   C18 column and 0.1 % TFA (v/v in milliQ water) and
acetonitrile (CH
3
CN) as mobile phases. Gradient elution was
performed from 30 to 50 % CH
3
CN for 8 min, followed by 100 %
CH
3
CN for 2 min and 30 % CH
3
CN for 2 min, at a constant flow rate
0.6 mL/min and column oven at 30 ° C. Compounds were detected
at 260 nm, and retention times for 1 a, 3 a, 4 a and 5 a were 3.3, 3.6,
3.9 and 5.6 min respectively; and for 1 b, 3 b, and 5 b were 4.1, 4.5
and 5.2 min respectively (see chromatograms in Supporting
Information). All quantitative analyses were performed measuring
peak area using the external standard method. The enantiomeric
excess (ee%) was determined with a Chiralpak® AD   H column, with
98.5 : 1.5:0.1 n-hexane:EtOH:diethylamine as the mobile phase, at a
flow rate 1 mL/min for 20 min and detection at 220 nm (see
chromatograms in Supporting Information).
