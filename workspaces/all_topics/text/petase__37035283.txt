ABSTRACT: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most common
polyester plastic in the packaging industry and a major source of environmental
pollution due to its single use. Several enzymes, termed PET hydrolases, have
been found to hydrolyze this polymer at different temperatures, with the
enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis (IsPETase) having optimal catalytic activity at
30−35 °C. Crystal structures of IsPETase have revealed that the side chain of a
conserved tryptophan residue within an active site loop (W185) shifts between
three conformations to enable substrate binding and product release. This is
facilitated by two residues unique to IsPETase, S214 and I218. When these
residues are inserted into other PET hydrolases in place of the otherwise strictly
conserved histidine and phenylalanine residues found at their respective
positions, they enhance activity and decrease T
opt
. Herein, we combine
molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations to investigate
dynamic changes of the S214/I218 and H214/F218 variants of IsPETase, as well as three other mesophilic and thermophilic PET
hydrolases, at their respective temperature and pH optima. Our simulations show that the S214/I218 insertion both increases the
flexibility of active site loop regions harboring key catalytic residues and the conserved tryptophan and expands the conformational
plasticity of this tryptophan side chain, enabling the conformational transitions that allow for substrate binding and product release
in IsPETase. The observed catalytic enhancement caused by this substitution in other PET hydrolases appears to be due to
conformational selection, by capturing the conformational ensemble observed in IsPETase.

INTRODUCTION
The inexpensive manufacturing, long-term durability, and high
resistance to degradation of plastics have led to its concerning
accumulation as waste in landfills and oceans at rates that
parallel its annual production.
1
The primary sources of plastic
waste are single-use or short-lifetime consumer plastics, mainly
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyethylene (PE), and
polypropylene (PP), with PET being the predominant polymer
in postconsumer domestic plastic waste collected in countries
such as the UK (40% abundance).
2
Although PET is recognized as one of the most recyclable
plastics due to the vast presence of mechanical recycling
industries, it can only endure a limited number of cycles before
its properties are compromised. For example, the tensile and
impact strength of virgin PET used in bottles decreases almost
linearly within the first three extrusion cycles,
3
whereas its
ductility is reduced from >200 to <10% elongation at break
upon mechanical recycling.
4
Consequently, recycled PET ends
up being used in lower-grade PET applications that are seldom
recycled, breaking the circularity of this process.
In this context, the discovery of PET hydrolases
5,6
has
emerged as a promising and environmentally friendly approach
for plastic biorecycling.
7,8
These enzymes depolymerize PET
into its main constituent monomers, which can then be used to
resynthesize virgin PET and thus enable a fully circular plastic
recycling process.
9
Most PET hydrolytic enzymes are
thermophilic,
5
with optimal activities (∼65 °C) near the
glass-transition temperature of PET (∼75 °C
10
), where the
polymer chains become more flexible and are prone to
enzymatic hydrolysis, due to the inability of PET hydrolases to
degrade highly crystalline PET. However, a PET hydrolase
from the mesophilic bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6
(IsPETase) was described to degrade amorphous and semi-
crystalline PET with high efficiency at 30−35 °C.
11
While most known PET hydrolytic enzymes have been
subjected to protein engineering via rational design or directed

evolution, with substantial improvements in thermal stability
and depolymerase activity,
12
finding a “one size fits all”
solution to improve the catalytic efficiency of any PET
hydrolase has been elusive. A recent work
13
presented a
general mechanism for improving their catalytic activity based
on the experimentally observed dihedral torsions of a
conformationally dynamic tryptophan side chain in IsPETase,
W185 (Figure 1), that is highly conserved in PET hydrolases in
a loop within the active site (hereafter referred to as the W-
loop). On a nearby helix, there are two residues, S214 and
I218, which are unique to IsPETase, and in all other known
PET hydrolytic enzymes correspond to histidine and phenyl-
alanine.
Crystal structures of IsPETase in the absence of substrates
(PDB ID: 5XG0
14
) show that the W185 side chain can adopt
three conformations, termed A, B, and C, as illustrated in
Figure 1, a phenomenon that has been described in the
literature as “wobbling”.
15
Substrate analogue-bound enzyme
complexes (PDB IDs: 5XH2
14
and 5XH3
14
) show that this
residue adopts conformer B for substrate binding, where it can
form T-shaped, stacked, or parallel displaced interactions with
one of the terephthalic rings of the substrate. Comparison of
the crystal structure of IsPETase against a thermophilic PET
hydrolase from a leaf-branch compost metagenome (LCC)
suggests that the small size of S214 yields sufficient space for
W185 to rotate to accommodate the substrate.
15
Altogether, it
is thought that tryptophan motion is relevant for substrate
binding and product release. Consistently with this, the S214H
mutant of IsPETase shows decreased activity compared to the
wild-type enzyme.
14
We note that there have been multiple elegant computa-
tional studies that have helped reveal the mechanisms of PET-
degrading enzymes,
16−19
more global conformational changes
involved in catalysis,
20,21
and contributed to associated
engineering effort.
22−25
However, corresponding studies of
the conformational dynamics of this catalytically important
tryptophan remain limited. Therefore, to explore the
importance of the S214/I218 substitution for PET hydrolytic
activity, doubly substituted variants of the strictly conserved
histidine and phenylalanine residues in several PET hydrolases,
including the mesophilic BurPL from a Burkholderiales
bacterium (H344/F348),
13
and the thermophilic Tf Cut from
Thermobifida fusca (H224/F228)
26
and LCC (H218/F222),
27
were generated based on the S214/I218 residues unique to
IsPETase. All engineered variants have experimentally shown
an increase in PET-degrading activity.
13
Conversely, an H214/
F218 variant of IsPETase exhibits a decrease in PET hydrolase
activity.
13
The enhancement in PET hydrolysis caused by the
S214/I218 substitution is accompanied by a decrease in the
optimal temperature for catalytic activity (T
opt
), suggesting that
the substitutions impact either the local or global stability of
these enzymes.
In this work, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) and
well-tempered metadynamics
28
simulations to explore the
structural basis of the improved catalytic activity of BurPL,
Tf Cut, and LCC upon incorporation of the IsPETase-based
S214/I218 double substitution. Our results show that these
substitutions increase the flexibility of both active site loop
regions harboring key catalytic residues, and the conforma-
tional plasticity of the conserved tryptophan within the W-
loop. Notably, while all of the experimentally determined
tryptophan conformers are accessible for all enzymes, the
IsPETase-based S214/I218 substitution appears to facilitate
population shifts to and from conformer A, as well as other
conformations, such as a 180° side chain rotation that has not
been observed in any solved crystal structures of PET
hydrolases. Overall, our simulations provide evidence for a
dynamical origin for the enhanced catalytic activity of the
doubly substituted variants, affecting both loop dynamics and
the conformational plasticity of the tryptophan.

METHODOLOGY
Preparation of Initial Structures
Initial coordinates for wild-type BurPL (H344/F348), LCC
(H218/F222), and Tf Cut (H224/F228) were obtained from
the crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank
29
under PDB IDs: 7CWQ,
13
4EB0,
27
and 5ZOA,
30
respectively.
For IsPETase, the initial structure corresponded to the recently
solved structure of the single-point mutant S214H, PDB ID:
7CY0,
13
where the serine residue in S214/I218 was replaced
by the histidine that is strictly conserved in other PET
hydrolytic enzymes. The doubly substituted versions of BurPL
(S344/I348), Tf Cut (S224/I228), and LCC (S218/I222), as
well as the S214/I218 and H214/F218 variants of IsPETase,
were generated using the Mutagenesis tool in PyMOL v.
2.4.2.

Both IsPETase and BurPL harbor an active site (C203-C239
for IsPETase, C333-C370 for BurPL) and a C-terminal (C273-
C289 for IsPETase, C404-C424 for BurPL) disulfide bond. For
Tf Cut and LCC, only the C-terminal disulfide bond (C281-
C299 for Tf Cut, C275-C292 for LCC) is present. These
disulfide bonds, which are present in the available crystal
structures, were kept in all of the wild-type enzymes and
doubly substituted variants.
Residue numbers for each enzyme are presented throughout
the main text according to the full-length amino acid sequences
of these proteins in the Uniprot database,
32
with accession IDs:
A0A0K8P6T7 (IsPETase), A0A1F4JXW8 (BurPL), Q6A0I4
(Tf Cut), and G9BY57 (LCC).
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
MD simulations were performed using the pmemd.cuda
implementation of the AMBER 2020 simulation package,
33
along with the ff14SB force field
34
and the TIP3P
35
water
model for the parameters of protein atoms and water
molecules, respectively. For each of the eight simulation
systems, the protonation state of each residue at pH 9.0 was
estimated with the H++ server,
36
to match the experimental
conditions in enzymatic degradation assays using either PET
films or granules.
13
The consistency of the estimated
protonation states for the wild-type and doubly substituted
variant of each enzyme was manually checked. The residues
affected by the choice of pH include the catalytic histidine in
all four enzymes (which would be protonated at pH 7),
alongside E334 and H408 in BurPL, which are not part of the
active site cleft. The pK
1/2
of these residues, employed by the
H++ server to compute whether they should be protonated or
not depending on the pH, is reported in Table S1. Then, all
systems were solvated in truncated octahedral water boxes with
15 Å of padding and neutralized with Na
+
or Cl
−
counterions.
A standard minimization, heating, and 10 ns equilibration
protocol were performed, followed by NPT production at 1
bar and the experimentally determined optimal temperature of
catalytic activity for each system
13
(i.e. 303 K for IsPETase, 308
K for BurPL, 323 K for LCC, and 333 K for Tf Cut). Constant
temperature and pressure conditions for each system were
controlled using a Langevin thermostat
37
with a collision
frequency of 1 ps
−1
, and a Berendsen barostat
38
with a pressure
relaxation time of 1 ps. MD simulations were run using a time
step of 2 fs along with the SHAKE
39
algorithm to constrain
hydrogen-containing bonds, a 12 Å cutoff for nonbonded
interactions, and the particle-mesh Ewald
40
method for long-
range electrostatics. Five 500 ns long replicas were produced
for each of the wild-type and doubly substituted systems, for a
total of 20 μs of MD simulations. The convergence of the
simulations is shown in Figure S1.
Well-Tempered Metadynamics Simulations
To study the torsional free energy associated with rotation of
the conserved W-loop tryptophan, we performed eight 400-ns-
long well-tempered metadynamics
28
simulations (one per
system), using the AMBER 2020
33
simulation package and
Plumed 2.7.

We used as collective variables (CVs) the χ

) and χ
2
(C

) dihedral angles, which
describe the torsional space of the tryptophan side chain.
Metadynamics runs were started after 50 ns of NPT
equilibration (following the same protocol and simulation
settings as the MD). The backbone root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of the helices and β-sheets of the protein
structure, and the convergence of our metadynamics runs, are
shown in Figures S2−S4. Simulations were performed using a
bias factor of 12, a Gaussian width of 9° per CV, a Gaussian
initial height of 0.1 kcal/mol, and a deposition rate of 1 ps
−1
.
The convergence of these simulations was checked by
monitoring the evolution of the CVs over time together with
the free energy profile.
The free energy surface as a function of the two chosen CVs
was calculated according to the theory of well-tempered
metadynamics.

Simulation Analysis
Simulation analysis was performed using the CPPTRAJ

and the Python library

Snapshots were collected every 50 ps from
the MD production runs for further analysis. Open cleft
volume analysis was performed using POcket Volume
MEasurer (POVME) 3.0,
47
by considering 1000 frames over
all replicas, taken every 2.5 ns of the production run. An initial
sphere of radius 4 Å located at the center of mass between the
α-carbon atoms of residues Y87 and M161 (IsPETase), Y217
and M291 (BurPL), Y100 and S170 (Tf Cut), and Y95 and
S165 (LCC) was used for the calculations. The residues
forming the cleft are represented in Figure S5 and listed in
Table S2. Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) were
calculated on the C

atoms along the amino acid sequence
of each protein relative to their averaged position over time.
Hydrogen bonds for catalytic residues were calculated by
considering a donor−acceptor distance cutoff of 3.5 Å and a
donor−hydrogen−acceptor angle cutoff of 120°, considering

all 25,000 frames collected per replica. The same number of
frames was employed for calculating the change in distance
between the C

atoms of the conserved tryptophan in the W-
loop and the conserved tyrosine with which it forms an active
site aromatic clamp.

Finally, shortest path map (SPM)
analysis was carried out by means of the DynaComm.py Python
script,

using the dynamic cross-correlation matrices and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To determine the effects of the S214/I218 double substitution
on PET hydrolase dynamics, we analyzed the root-mean-
square fluctuations (RMSF) of the H214/F218 and S214/I218
variants of IsPETase and of the equivalent variants for BurPL,
Tf Cut, and LCC across a cumulative 2.5 μs of conventional
MD simulations of each unliganded system (5 × 500 ns
trajectories per system) at their respective temperature and pH
optima. In all cases, comparison of the variants for each
enzyme did not show significant differences in RMSF
throughout the protein (Figure S6), except for the W- and
D-loops (Figure 2), which harbor the conserved active site
tryptophan (W185 in IsPETase) and the catalytic aspartic acid
(D206 in IsPETase), respectively.
From the data shown in Figure 2, it is observed that in
IsPETase, the substitution of S214/I218 by H214/F218
reduces the flexibility of the D-loop. Conversely, in the other
PET-degrading enzymes, which harbor histidine and phenyl-
alanine in their wild-type forms, the double substitution by
serine and isoleucine increases the overall flexibility of the D-
loop and, in the case of Tf Cut and LCC, the W-loop (although
the precise magnitude of this effect varies by enzyme and
specific loop). Moreover, the H-loop is more flexible in the
serine and isoleucine variants of IsPETase and BurPL than in
Tf Cut and LCC, despite harboring the active site disulfide
bond connecting the D-loop and H-loop in the mesophilic
enzymes (Figure 1). This could be explained by the longer
extension of the H-loop in IsPETase and BurPL than in the
thermophilic enzymes, which enables the formation of a
continuous cleft for substrate binding.
49
Despite the differences in loop flexibility of the key active
site loops, two of which carry residues from the catalytic triad
(Figure 1), we observe only subtle differences in the hydrogen-
bonding patterns between the side chains of the catalytic serine
(S160 in IsPETase) and histidine (H237 in IsPETase) and of
the histidine and aspartate (D206 in IsPETase) for the
IsPETase-based S214/I218 and H214/F218 variants of each
system (Figures 3 and S7). It is worth noting that while the
differences within each system are small, there is a more
marked effect when comparing between different enzymes, and
in particular between the mesophilic IsPETase and BurPL and
the thermophilic Tf Cut and LCC enzymes. Here, all
mesophilic enzymes exhibit substantially lower occupancy of
the key hydrogen-bonding interactions, and in particular the
serine−histidine interaction (Figure 3A), than their thermo-
philic counterparts. This is consistent with the fact that the key
active site loops in the mesophilic enzymes are overall more
flexible than their thermophile counterparts (Figure 2), even
after introducing the serine and isoleucine double substitution,
and may account for the reduced catalytic activity of the
mesophiles compared to their thermophilic counter-
parts.
12−14,20
Following from this, we also calculated the volume of the
active site cleft in all enzymes using POVME 3.0.
47
The
resulting averages and standard deviations are shown in Table
1. As can be seen from these data, with the exception of BurPL,
the IsPETase-based H214/F218 and S214/I218 variants of
each system have similar active site volumes and fluctuations.
However, there is quite a spread in active site volume and
flexibility (using standard deviation as a proxy measure for
flexibility), with BurPL and Tf Cut having the most compact
and least flexible clefts, and LCC having the largest and most
flexible cleft. The average cleft volume depends on its shape,

and on how many and how bulky the amino acid side chains
which point inside the cleft are, whereas the volume
fluctuations are intimately related to the structural flexibility
of the cleft.
For all enzymes, the conserved W-loop tryptophan is facing
a tyrosine residue, forming an aromatic clamp into which one
of the terephthalic rings of PET binds.
14,20
When W185 in
IsPETase (PDB ID: 5XG0
14
) adopts conformer B, the distance
between the C
γ
atoms of this residue and Y87 in the aromatic
clamp is 9.2 Å, whereas for conformer C, the distance is 7.8 Å
(Figure S8). Therefore, we analyzed the change in distance
between these aromatic residues in all MD simulations. As
shown in Figure 4, a median distance of ∼8.1 Å, similar to the
experimental distance for the C conformer of W185, is
obtained from the MD simulations for both IsPETase and
BurPL. In contrast, a median distance of 8.9 Å, resembling the
experimental distance for conformer B, is observed for
simulations of IsPETase and BurPL with the S214/I218
substitutions. Finally, no differences are observed for the
median distance of both variants of Tf Cut and LCC, with
TfCut having a median distance 2 Å away from the
crystallographic distance (PDB ID: 5ZOA
30
), whereas LCC
is closer to the experimental distance (PDB ID: 4EB0
27
)
(Figure S8).
Following from this, we performed shortest path map
(SPM) analysis
48
on the MD replicas to analyze the allosteric
communication pathways that potentially connect the different
active site loop regions. The SPM method allows for the
calculation of the shortest pathways between all residues (the
nodes) in the network. Nodes and edges (pathways between
nodes) that are often used for communication between
residues can then be identified, and these residues can
therefore be considered as being important for regulating the
global conformational dynamics of the enzyme. The calculated
allosteric communication pathways are presented in Figure 5
and illustrate the differences between enzymes from different
source organisms. Loop D and the mutation-hosting helix are
only mildly important for the pathway of both variants of
IsPETase. In BurPL, loop H harbors significant residues whose
motions are highly correlated. In Tf Cut, the network includes
nodes on protein sections far from the active site.
When comparing the enzyme variants studied here, it is
observed that the three loops, W, D, and H, appear linked to
each other through different pathways on the identified
networks. That is, with the exception of IsPETase, the SPM
calculates a path connecting loops D and W in the cases of the
histidine- and phenylalanine-containing variants (shown in red
in Figure 5), whereas for IsPETase, this connection is absent in
both H214/F218 and S214/I218 variants. For the H344/F348
variant of BurPL, the connection takes place between the W-
loop tryptophan (W315) and the H344/F348 histidine. In
LCC and Tf Cut, the correlation takes place between the
tryptophan (W190 and W195 respectively) in loop W, and
A213 and A219, respectively. It is therefore possible that both
the enhanced fluctuations of loops H and D, and the decreased
correlations of the dynamics of the conserved tryptophan in
loop W with residues on loop D may depend on the bulkier
nature of histidine and phenylalanine, which may exert
additional steric repulsion on loop W.
Next, we explored the effect of the IsPETase-based serine
and isoleucine double substitution on the conformational
stability of the side chain of the conserved tryptophan from
Figure 3. Frequency of interactions between key residues of the
catalytic triad (Figure 1) during 5 × 500 ns simulations of each of the

Crystal structures of IsPETase (PDB ID:

) have shown that W185 can rotate into conformers A
(chain A, χ

= 187.4°, χ

= 20.7°), B (chain B, χ

Upon

(Figure 1).
To probe whether this plasticity is facilitated by the serine
and isoleucine double substitution or by other features of the
IsPETase scaffold, we calculated the χ

dihedral torsions
of the corresponding tryptophan in all of the trajectories. From
these data, it can be seen that the tryptophan side chain residue

dihedral angles are consistent with the B and C
conformers of wild-type IsPETase in all of the H214/F218 and
S214/I218 PET hydrolase variants (Figure 6). In contrast, the
space created by the S214/I218 substitution and by the
equivalent double substitution in BurPL, Tf Cut, and LCC
enables the tryptophan to rotate into the A conformer in all

studied in this work. The SPM is represented by spheres (residues) and edges (connections between residues), with the size of the spheres and
edges being proportional to the number of pathways involving a sphere or edge, and a larger sphere size effectively meaning more importance of
that residue for allosteric communication. Loop D and the S214/I218-H214/F218 containing helix are represented in orange, loop H in green, and

PET hydrolases, as well as explore new conformations (Figures
6 and 7) that have not been captured in experimental
structures. This is consistent with the expected plasticity of this
residue in the unliganded form of the enzyme.
14
This plasticity
is lost in the H214/F218 variant of IsPETase, consistent with
the observed loss of activity of the IsPETase S187H variant.
14
These data highlight that the S214/I218 residues alone are
sufficient to facilitate W185 and the equivalent residue in all
other enzymes to rotate, without the need for other
modifications to the scaffold, and that this “wobbling effect”
appears to be transferable to other PET hydrolases.
Given the observed conformational plasticity of the
conserved tryptophan residue in loop W, we opted to fully
explore its torsional space via well-tempered metadynamics
simulations,
28
in which the χ
1
and χ
2
dihedrals were used as
collective variables (CVs). These simulations reached con-
vergence within 400 ns, in terms of the diffusive behavior of
the simulations (Figures S3 and S4). The free energy surfaces
(FES) for each enzyme as a function of the two chosen CVs
are presented in Figure 8. The overall landscape is conserved
across all enzyme variants, with several common basins
(labeled from A to I), separated by high energy barriers

and the W-loop tryptophan are shown in sticks, the MD-derived conformers for the W-loop tryptophan are shown in yellow, and the

(Figure 8 and Table S3). The D, E, and F basins correspond to
the tryptophan side chain being oriented toward S/H214 and
I/F218. In the F basin, the tryptophan is also proximal to the
aspartic acid, in the I basin to the histidine and in the G basin
to the serine of the catalytic triad, respectively. The H218/
F222 variant of LCC and Tf Cut (either as H224/F228 or
S224/I228) feature neither the F nor the I basins. The I basin
is only present in the H214/F218 variant of IsPETase and
H344/F348 variant of BurPL. For LCC and Tf Cut, the S218/
I222 and S224/I228 mutations lower the barriers that connect
the basins B, G, and E (Table S3). This is connected to an
outward torsion of the tryptophan side chain (i.e., in the
direction of the solvent), with the G basin corresponding to a
conformation where the side chain shields the catalytic
histidine from the solvent. The F basin in the S218/I222
mutant of LCC consists of the tryptophan side chain located in
proximity to the catalytic residues.
Despite the overall topological similarities between the FES
for each enzyme, important energetic differences are observed
(Table S3). With the exception of BurPL, the different FES
suggest that conformers A and B in the serine and isoleucine
doubly substituted variants are nearly isoenergetic, in
comparison to the energetic favorability of the B conformer
in the histidine and phenylalanine variants. Since the
neighboring side chains for these conformers are almost the
same for all organisms, this probably arises from subtle
dynamical effects of the W-loop. Specifically, for LCC and
Tf Cut, this change in the energetics of the FES is accompanied
by reductions of 4.4 and 3.3 kcal/mol in the relative free
energy difference between the B and A basins, respectively
(Table S3). These results suggest that the IsPETase-based
S214/I218 substitutions result in enhanced “wobbling” of the
W-loop tryptophan in these thermophilic enzymes, consistent
with their 2- and 3-fold increase in activity against PET films.
13
Similarly, conformer D is energetically more favorable for the
IsPETase-based S214/I218 PETase variants in comparison to
the histidine and phenylalanine variants in almost all cases,
except for BurPL.
While our simulations are unable to elucidate the role of the
new conformers observed by MD simulations for W185 in
IsPETase and of the equivalent tryptophan residue in all
variants of BurPL, Tf Cut, and LCC, recent works have
provided valuable insights. Plastic degradation assays and MD
simulations by Guo et al.
50
showed that PET polymers can
bind in two different backbone conformations on the active
site of IsPETase, trans (straight polymer conformation) and
gauche (twisted polymer conformation), with a preferential
selectivity for the gauche conformation that is abundant in PET
films but absent in pretreated PET bottles. Interestingly, they
design a trans-selective mutant (S238A) that has higher
binding affinity to PET films than the wild-type enzyme and 3-
fold higher activity against an all-trans PET substrate, which is
enabled by W185 adopting conformer A to enable polymer
binding in trans.
50
In addition, a similar work on computational and
experimental engineering of IsPETase to enhance its activity
against PET
22
shows that W185 in the wild-type enzyme
adopts conformers different from B to establish parallel
displaced interactions with the terephthalic ring in the
lowest-energy, catalytically competent predicted pose. Con-
versely, the W159H/S238F mutant, with higher activity against
PET, binds the substrate in a conformer similar to B to
establish T-shaped interactions. Moreover, when modeling the
binding of polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), an
emerging bioplastic for replacing PET that is also degraded
by IsPETase, W185 adopts conformers similar to D and A in
the wild-type and W159H/S238F mutant enzymes, respec-
tively.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have performed a combination of MD and
well-tempered metadynamics
28
simulations on four represen-
tative PET hydrolases with different optimal temperatures for
hydrolytic activity, with the goal of providing an atomistic
explanation on why the IsPETase-based S214/I218 substitu-
tion of two residues in the vicinity of the active site open cleft
enhances the activity. Our investigation provides useful
information regarding both the local dynamics of their active
site. In particular, we have focused our attention on the
flexibility of the active site and on the conformational plasticity
of the side chain of a particularly important and highly
conserved W-loop tryptophan, whose roles in the activity of
these hydrolases have been previously demonstrated.
14,20
Our MD simulations illustrate that the S214/I218
substitution results in enhanced flexibility of the active site
loops (as demonstrated by their higher fluctuations), in
particular loop D that is connected to the helix that harbors
the substituted residues. In turn, this flexibility allows the W-
loop tryptophan and the tyrosine residue with which it forms
an active site aromatic clamp
20
to occupy distances compatible
with conformers for substrate binding in the two mesophilic
enzymes studied. Even though the volume of the active site
and its fluctuations over time are essentially unaltered by the
mutations, we can speculate that the shape of the external part
of the open cleft is, in the case of the IsPETase-based S214/
I218 variants, amenable to accommodate the binding of a PET
chain in the early stages of the overall degradation process.
Validating this requires simulations that include the substrate
docked into the binding pocket; whether this flexibility does in
fact help substrate binding or product release will be a very
interesting topic for future modeling studies. It is also clear that
at the level of the global scaffold, the communication pathways
differ by both organism and variant, which affects the flexibility
of key loops and in turn the conformational sampling of the
conserved tryptophan.
Regarding the conserved tryptophan, the unbiased MD
simulations visited additional conformers A, D, and E for the
IsPETase-based S214/I218 variants of PET hydrolases on a
500 ns timescale. Meanwhile, the free energy surfaces emerging
from thorough exploration via metadynamics show how
rotating through different basins is more likely in these PET
hydrolase variants (which is true in general but it is particularly
important for basins A and B), after elimination of the steric
effects caused by the conserved histidine and phenylalanine
residues.
14,15
This enhanced rotation could be important for
facilitating substrate binding and product release.
Prior work has proposed that these rotations of the
conserved tryptophan are required to provide optimal aromatic
interactions for the stabilization of substrate binding.
22
Our
insights complement these observations, suggesting that easy
access and switch between different conformers of the
conserved tryptophan is required for productive binding of
different substrate conformations and possibly for product
release to enable continued hydrolysis. The latter requires PET
hydrolysis experiments in the presence of degradation products
and simulations of enzyme−product complexes addressing the

molecular mechanisms of exiting the active site of PET
hydrolases.
Evolutionary conformational selection is not unique to PET
hydrolases: de novo designed Kemp eliminases such as the
HG3
51
and KE07
52,53
series also possess conformational
flexible and catalytically important tryptophan side chains in
their active sites, the conformations of which are optimized
during directed evolution. Similarly, laboratory evolution of an
organophosphate hydrolase, serum paraoxonase 1, showed
similar conformational effects in key active site residues along
the evolutionary trajectory.
54
Similarly to these systems, our
results suggest that engineering of PET hydrolases with
mutations that enable conformational selection of the
conserved tryptophan, such as S214/I218 and the S238A
mutation in IsPETase, could lead to predefined active site
conformations matching the polymer conformations in PET
materials and enable higher catalytic efficiency. Further
computational and experimental work is necessary to explore
how different tryptophan conformations enable higher catalytic
activity in natural and engineered PET hydrolases.
