The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3HP/4HB) cycle from ammonia-oxidizing
Thaumarchaeota is currently considered the most energy-efﬁcient aerobic carbonﬁxation pathway.
The Nitrosopumilus maritimus4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming; Nmar_0206)
represents one of several enzymes from this cycle that exhibit increased efﬁciency over crenarchaeal
counterparts. This enzyme reduces energy requirements on the cell, reﬂecting thaumarchaeal
success in adapting to low-nutrient environments. Here we show the structure of Nmar_0206 from
Nitrosopumilus maritimusSCM1, which reveals a highly conserved interdomain linker loop between
the CoA-binding and ATP-grasp domains. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the widespread prevalence
of this loop and highlights both its underrepresentation within the PDB and structural importance
within the (ATP-forming) acyl-CoA synthetase (ACD) superfamily. This linker is shown to have a
possible inﬂuence on conserved interface interactions between domains, thereby inﬂuencing
homodimer stability. These results provide a structural basis for the energy efﬁciency of this key
enzyme in the modiﬁed 3HP/4HB cycle of Thaumarchaeota.
Despite growing awareness of global climate change, carbon dioxide
emissions are still increasing1. In order to address this critical issue, engi-
neered autotrophic carbon-ﬁxation cycles are being developed from a broad
array of natural sources as a potential strategy to reduce atmospheric
carbon
2,3. Carbonﬁxation refers to the conversion of inorganic carbon to
biologically useful organic compounds. This very ancient process has led to
at least 7 different pathways in all three domains of life throughout

mechanisms for the increased efﬁciency of the thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB

hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetases (Nmar_0206 and Nmar_1309). Both
synthetases, Nmar_0206 and Nmar_1309, are shown to be ADP-forming,

2 CoA-binding domains, and aCoA-ligase domain (Fig.2a). The organi-
zation and linkages between these shufﬂed domains varies widely between
ACD member proteins but the role this shufﬂing plays in protein stability
requires further investigation. ACDs perform their function fundamentally
different from their AMP-forming counterparts. AMP-forming Acyl-CoA
synthetases, such as those found inM. sedula, initiate their reactions by
passing through an adenylation reaction— covalently binding their substrate
to AMP before theﬁnal thioesteriﬁcation event16,17. Instead, the ADP-
forming synthetases pass through a [substrate]-phosphohistidine inter-
mediate formed with a single gamma phosphate of ATP, thereby conserving
an intact ADP (Fig.2b)
18. In this study, we determined the structure of
Nmar_0206 to 2.8Å. We describe the structure of Nmar_0206, highlighting
the unique linker loop, interfaces, and binding site that differentiate it from
other ACDs. This may represent important scientiﬁc and engineering
opportunities for improved carbonﬁxation.
Results and discussion
Overall crystal structure of Nmar_0206
The X-ray crystal structure of Nmar_0206 was determined to 2.8Å reso-
lution with two subunits within theAsymmetric Unit Cell. Each monomer
consists of 624 out of 698 residues of the full length Nmar_0206, functional
as a homodimer conﬁrmed through the GalaxyGemini server (PDB:
8WZU) (Fig.3). The resolved X-ray crystal structure of Nmar_0206 is a
homodimer in the asymmetric unit, each monomer consists of 624 out of
698 residues of the full length Nmar_0206 (PDB: 8WZU) (Fig.3). Like all
ACDs, Nmar_0206 consists of shufﬂed domains conserved within the
superfamily. ACD domain structure is usually described in comparison to
the E. coli Succinyl-CoA which has a domain structure of [alpha(1,2)/
beta(3,4,5)], whereas Nmar_0206 has the single protein chain [1-2-5-4-3]
19
(Fig. 2). In other words, the subdomains 1, 2, 5, 4 and 3 of Nmar_0206 are
connected in series from the N- to C-terminus. Subdomain 1 consists of a
Rossman-like fold, while subdomains 2 and 5 areﬂavodoxin-like. The
subdomains 1 and 2 of one monomer form a CoA-binding pocket with the
subdomain 5, a CoA ligase domain, of the other monomer. Subdomain 2
contains an evolutionarily conserved H256 on aﬂexible swinging loop
composed of small amino acids (residues S246-I266; Fig.3), which homo-
logous sites have been proposed to cross a distance of 31.5 Å to interact with
bound ATP in the ATP-grasp domain
19,20. It is stabilized by two power
helices within subdomains 2 and 5 of monomers, which present their N
termini near H256 (Fig.3), generating a positively charged environment
into which a reactive phosphate ion would be introduced but in which a
structurally similar sulfate is likely found (Fig.4)
21,22. In contrast to most
ACD structures within the PDB, domain 4 is attached to the C terminus of
subdomain 5 by an 18 residue solvent exposed linker loop spanning 35 Å
between W452-K469 (Fig.5a). Additionally, an interface can be found
between subdomains 4 and 5 of the two monomers (Fig.6). Subdomains 3
and 4 together form an ATP-grasp unit, with subdomain 3 existing within
subdomain 4 between residues 503 and 577. Although subdomain 3 is
catalytically important in both the binding and transfer of phosphate from
ATP to the phosphohistidine swinging loop
20, it was not present within the
electron density map, suggesting free movement when unbound. Sub-
domain 4 comprises the ATP-binding site with ATP-interacting residues
present (Supplementary Fig. 3).

group, but Crenarchaeota enzymes are AMP-forming while Thaumarchaeota

Likely bound sulfate at active site of Nmar_0206
Although the Nmar_0206 structure lacks any of the standard interacting
substrates, a positive electron density is found nearby H256 (side chain not
found within the electron density). We posited that sulfate, structurally very
similar to phosphate, from the crystallization buffer (including 200 mM
lithium sulfate) is bound here and can be found interacting with G163,
A164, G310 and G311 (Fig.4). At the positive head of the two power helices,
this sulfate could mimic the binding mode of phosphate, one of the products
of the reaction. This conﬁguration could represent aﬁnal leftover product
bound to the structure after releasing 4HB-CoA and ADP.
Linker loop and associated interfaces found between CoA-
binding domain— ATP-Grasp domain
The presence of a similar linker loop between the two substrate binding
macrodomains wasﬁrst shown by Li et al.21 in PDB 7CM9 fromPsychro-
bacter sp. D2 (a homologous DMSP lyase). The Nmar_0206 structure
similarly displays a 18 residue solvent exposed linker loop spanning 35 Å
between W452-K469 (Fig.5a, b) with an unclear function. A stark difference
between the CoA-binding and ATP-grasp domain interfaces of the linker-
containing Nmar_0206 and linker-less Acetyl-CoA synthetase structures
may suggest that the linker provides an alternative to the stability that comes
from hydrophobic domain interactions (Fig.6b, d)23,24. Of the 138 ACD
superfamily sequences used to generate the phylogenetic tree (Fig.5c;
Supplementary Data 1), 72.5% contain the aforementioned linker (ﬁve out
of six representative groups). Within the PDB, structures exist for DMSP-
lyase, succinyl-, citryl-, acetyl-, andnow 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetases
of which only two are heterotetrameric and do not contain a linker of some
kind (see 7CM9 and 8WZU).
Within the greater ACD superfamily— enzymes that generally have
roles in carbon ﬁxation, acetate metabolism, and ATP generation—
Nmar_0206 falls clearly into the Thaumarchaeota, as expected (Fig.5c)
25.
The next closest relatives of Nmar_0206 are the methanogens (Methano-
bacteria, Domain Archaea), forming adistinct branch together with Cre-
narchaeota and Thaumarchaeota sequences. The other key enzyme of the
3HP/4HB cycle, Nmar_1309, shows some similarity to Nmar_0206 but is
phylogenetically distinct; for this reason, Nmar_1309 and other related 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase sequences can be seen as an outgroup
within our ACD tree (Fig.5c). These phylogenetic relationships map to
evolutionary separations between Archaea and Bacteria, and highlight the
shift to the ACDs found within the 3HP/4HB cycle. This is supported in part
by our results, as the closest relative to Thermoproteia ACDs (archaeal
heterotetramers) are from Chloroﬂexota, a separate bacterial lineage
(Fig. 5c). Such similarity between archaeal and bacterial ACDs would be
unlikely to result from convergent evolution, potentially indicating hor-
izontal gene transfer (HGT). As Thermoproteia ACDs are heterotetramers
(includingCa.K o r a r c h a e u m ,P D B :4 X Y M ;s e ea l s oF i g .6), these sequences
might indicate an evolutionary link between homodimer Thaumarchaeota
ACDs and the heterotetramer structures. This could suggest two separate
HGT events: (1) between the heterotetramer Thermoproteia and the
homodimer Chloroﬂexota, and (2) between the Chloroﬂexota and the rest
of the homodimer Thaumarchaeota relatives. Even with this structural
commonality, the amino acid sequence logos (Fig.5b) display the large
variability in amino acid composition of the linker loop.
Despite relative conservation in the interface between Nmar_0206
chains, the interface between the CoA-binding and ATP-grasp domains is
m u c hs m a l l e ri nt h i sh o m o d i m e rs t r u c t u r ew h e nc o m p a r e dt ot h eh e t e r o -
dimer acetyl-CoA synthetase (Fig.6a–d). As the interface domain plays a role
in dimerization, the smaller interface could be supported by these covalently
fused chains. Assuming that this is the product of the linkage between the two
domains, it is worth noting thatCa. Korachaeum typically live at high
temperatures (78–92 °C)
26 whereas the mesophileN. maritimusgrows at
cooler oceanic temperatures (15–35 °C)27. The presence of this stabilizing
linker loop in a mesophile and not a hyperthermophile gives further support
to the suggested thermophilic ancestor of modern Thaumarchaeota
28.
However, it is intriguing that this feature also occurs throughout non-
mesophilic Thaumarchaeota sequences (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Residue shifts within homologous active sites
To accommodate a 4HB structure within the active site, some residues have
shifted or been replaced. Using residues shown to be interacting with theCa.
Korachaeum acetyl-CoA synthetaseas reference (PDB: 4YAK), compar-
isons were made between the Nmar_0206 structure (PDB: 8WZU) and
others within the PDB with bound substrates (PDB: 6HXH and 5CAE)
(Fig. 7b). Associated residues for L131, F146, A164, G355’and S385’can

important reactive elements, likely sulfate, and the
linker between ATP-grasping and CoA-binding

with ATP (see pdb:4XYM) as part of the full reaction
mechanism. The red colored swinging soop, which
bridges the gap between ATP and the active site,
transports a catalytically important histidine (yellow
residue) to the tip of the two power helices. Blue
power helices stabilize a likely sulfate found between
the two helices (Fig.4). Purple residues are proposed
to interact with 4HB-CoA (see pdb:4XYM) as part of
the reaction mechanism (see Supplementary Fig. 2).

each be found within 5 Å of the acetyl group within 4YAK. With the
exceptions of L131 and F146, these residues each shifted further away from
that same location within the Nmar_0206 structure (Fig.7a). The alpha
carbons of S385’, G355’, and A164 each shifted by 2.5Å, 1.5Å and 1.1Å
respectively.
A comparison among the related amino acid sequence logos (Fig.7c)
highlight residues originally identiﬁed as interacting with the acetyl-group
from acetyl-CoA within PDB: 4YAK. The MSA (Supplementary Fig. 1) used
to generate these logos show F146, A164 and G355 as being highly
conserved, suggesting important interactions with conserved elements (i.e.,
carboxyl end of substrate). L131 and S385 are much more variable, possibly
indicating residues allowingfor substrate promiscuity.
Residue conservation within ACDs
Finally, we compared conservation in internal residues among ACDs
between the subunits, particularly at the active site and ATP-binding sites
(Fig.8). Although all ACDs utilize CoA as asubstrate, the ATP-binding site
surprisingly appears only moderat ely conserved. Interface residues

(discussed in detail above) necessitate some conservation to maintain those
structural connections. Although this is seen to some degree within the
ConSurf results near the active site interactions (Fig.8), there is still mod-
erate variability in many residues along the interface.
Likely reaction mechanism of Nmar_0206
The reaction mechanism for ACDs has been previously established18–20,29.
Theﬁrst of the reported reaction steps begins when the gamma phosphate of
an ATP molecule is removed through a nucleophilic attack by a conserved
H535 to form phosphohistidine
18,20 (Fig. 9). The phosphate should then
be passed to the swinging loop ’sH 2 5 6 ,w h i c hf o r m sa n o t h e r
phosphohistidine19,20. Phospho-H256 should then swing roughly 30 Å back
towards the CoA-binding site betweensubdomains 1 and 2 where it binds to
4HB, forming a transient 4HB-phosphohistidine. Theﬁnal step of the
reaction mechanism involves the sulfur group from CoA performing a
nucleophilic attack on the 4HB group,leading to the release of a free phos-
phate and 4HB-CoA as theﬁnal products29. Our structure, albeit missing the
ATP-grasp domain lid (domain 3), is likely bound to sulfate within the active
site, suggesting a structural conformation just following the reaction before

Materials & methods
Cloning
The Nmar_0206 gene (see Supplementary Data 2) with an N-terminal
histidine tag was designed and codon-optimized using Genscript BioTech
trademark software before synthesis for Ni-NTA afﬁnity puriﬁcation. It was
then cloned into the pET28a vector usingNdeIa n dBamHI endonuclease
restriction sites, and transformed intoE. colistrain BL21(Rosetta-2) pur-
chased from Novagen. Transformed cells were selected for by growth in agar
plates containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 µg/
ml) at 37°C.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
Expression of Nmar_0206 was performed using the BL21(Rosetta-2)E. coli
transformed cells. Cultures were grown overnight in LB media and then
diluted 1:100 into 2 L cultures. The cell cultures were grown to an optical
density of 0.8 at 600 nm and then expressed overnight at 18 °C following
induction with 0.7 mM IPTG. Cell paste was then obtained following cen-
trifugation at 3700 ×g, resuspended in a lysis buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mM Tris, 300
mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100), and
sonicated. Soluble protein was maintained at 4 °C, puriﬁed using Ni-NTA
afﬁnity resin (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. The column
was equilibrated with pH 7.0 HisA (containing 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM
Tris). A column wash was performed using pH 7.0 HisA and eluted with pH
7.5 HisB containing 500 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris. Fol-
lowing puriﬁcation, thrombin and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol were added
to Nmar_0206 to remove the N-terminal histidine tag and reduce any dis-
ulﬁde bonds that stabilize oligomers. Reverse Ni-NTA was then performed to
remove the thrombin-cleaved hexa-histidine tag. Nmar_0206 purity was
conﬁrmed through SDS-PAGE. Following puriﬁcation, 5 mL of 50% glycerol
was added to 30 mL of the enzyme elutant for long-term storage.
Crystallization
Crystallization screens were performed using 72-well Terasaki microbatch
plates. 0.83 µL of puriﬁed Nmar_0206 were pipetted manually into the
bottom of the sitting drop well and mixed with an additional 0.83 µL of
∼3500 commercially available sparse-matrix crystallization screening
conditions
30 followed by a 16.6 µL application of Parafﬁn oil to protect
samples from oxidation. Plates were stored in styrofoam containers at room
temperature and crystals of Nmar_0206 were obtained 1-2 weeks after
initial crystallization screenings. Protein crystals were obtained in a solution
of 2.5 µL of 100 mM Na-acetate/acetic acid pH 4.5, 200 mM lithium sulfate,
50% (v/v) PEG 400, 2.5 µL of the enzyme solution, and 0.5 µL of 100% PEG
400 covered with ~50 µL of Parafﬁno i l .
Data collection and processing
Protein crystals of Nmar_0206 in 20% v/v glycerol were prepared for
crystallography byﬂash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The data was collected at
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource Beam-Line 12-2 at SLAC,
Menlo Park, California, USA. The detector distance for the enzyme

show structural changes surrounding bound substrates. Substrates for Nmar_0206
(4HB), 4YAK (acetate), 5CAE (succinate), and 6HXH (citrate) are shown next to
associated structures. Alignments were performed using the power helices tips and
nearby projecting loops for reference, namely residues G310-P312, V354-D356,
P128-C130, G163-I165, and G187-K189. The Pymol align algorithm was used with 0
outlier rejection cycles and provided RMSD values of 1.12 Å (4YAK), 1.61 Å (6HXH)
and 0.77 Å (5CAE) based on their Ca residue positions. Residues within 5 Å of the
carboxyl end of each substrate were displayed in stick mode.b Superposition of all

Schrödinger) and Coot (version 0.9.8.1).
Multiple sequence alignment preparation, phylogenetic tree
generation and consurf
The NCBI Protein BLAST (blastp) was used to search for homologous
sequences using Nmar_0206, Nmar_1309 and (ADP-forming) acetyl-CoA
synthetase from Candidatus Korarchaeum as separate query templates
(NCBI WP_012214589.1, WP_012215692.1 and WP_012308855.1
respectively). Out of the 300 sequences resulting from these three blastp
searches, 138 unique amino acid sequences were selected based on species
identiﬁers and used to construct a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in
MEGA (v11.0.13)
35 with the default settings for CLUSTALW program
(v2.1)36. This MSA (Supplementary Fig. 1) was used to generate an amino
acid-based phylogenetic tree of ACDs by the neighbor-joining method,
using default settings within MEGA. The phylogenetic tree was then
visualized with the iTOL: Interactive Tree of Life webserver37.T h e
Consurf webserver was used to estimate evolutionary conservation at each
amino acid position with default parameters and automatic homolog
selection

Conclusion
The adaptation of a highly efﬁcient 3HP/4HB cycle has helpedN. maritimus
and other ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota outcompete their bacterial
counterparts in oligotrophic environments
39–41. The Nmar_0206 structure
represents just one component of the greater search for functional elements
that differentiate the highly efﬁcient 3HP/4HB cycle of Thaumarchaeota
from less efﬁcient variants represented in Crenarchaeota.
The ACD superfamily is used during carbonﬁxation, acetate meta-
bolism, and ATP generation in many bacteria and archaea (see Supple-
mentary Data 1)
25. Synthetases speciﬁc to the 3HP/4HB cycle of
Thaumarchaeota include Nmar_0206 and Nmar_1309. The homodimer
seen within Nmar_0206 appears to be widespread within many microbial
species, suggesting that this is not a unique development within Thau-
marchaeota. Stability supported by the mentioned linker loop would
therefore be relevant within many other structures within the ACD
superfamily, suggesting two separatelineages of homodimers and hetero-
tetramers; however, what evolutionary beneﬁt such a fusion/separation
would provide is still unclear.
To complete the overall goal of identifying structural components of
increased energy efﬁciency, a similar analysis of an AMP-forming coun-
terpart of 4HB-CoA synthetase from Crenarchaeota would need to be
performed. Previous studies have described the AMP-forming substrate
binding pocket as being amenable to mutation, due to itsﬂexibility and the
large size of its binding site
42. Thus, substrateﬂexibility may partially explain
the wide distribution of AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases (62 members
in E.C. 6.2.1.) versus ACDs (9 members in E.C. 6.2.1.). Future investigations
should perform comparative binding site analysis of AMP-forming cre-
narchaeal counterparts with Nmar_0206 to support this.
The enzymes involved in the 3HP/4HB cycle have been selected
for energy-efﬁcient attributes, such as the bifunctionality of crotonyl-CoA
hydratase/3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase
43 and the oxygen-
tolerance of 4HB-CoA dehydratase44. The growing demand for carbon
ﬁxation strategies to remediate our rapidly changing atmosphere begs for
further tools, such as those which can be produced from the characteriza-
tion, and modiﬁcation of highly efﬁcient carbon cycling enzymes. The
structural characteristics of Nmar_0206 and related enzymes could help
inform scientists and engineers how to adapt these highly efﬁcient enzymes
for human needs.
