ABSTRACT
Human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) is a liver peroxisomal enzyme that metabolizes glyoxylate, the oxalate pre -
cursor, to glycine. AGT deficiency, due to recessive pathogenic changes in the AGXT  gene, results in calcium oxalate accumula -
tion and kidney stones, a condition known as primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). Most missense variants lead to PH1 by causing 
AGT misfolding, but their effects manifest differently based on the presence of two polymorphic variants, p.Pro11Leu (p.P11L) 
and p.Ile340Met (p.I340M), which are usually present in linkage disequilibrium and generate the minor haplotype. While the 
p.P11L substitution reduces AGT global stability and worsens the effects of pathogenic changes, the p.I340M exerts a stabilizing 
effect whose role on PH1 pathogenesis has never been elucidated. The p.Ile279Thr (p.I279T) variant is frequent in healthy pop -
ulations (0.29%), mainly on the major allele, but we present data from six PH1 families (eight patients) suggesting p.I279T as a 
PH1 pathogenic allele. Interestingly, in these families, p.Thr279 is always associated with p.Leu11 and p.Ile340, thus with a split 
AGXT haplotype. Analysis of the effects of the p.I279T mutation by in silico predictions, biochemical analyses on purified pro -
teins, and expression in two cellular models of disease ( AGXT1- KO HepG2 and CHO cells) shows that it causes a folding defect 
that is exacerbated by p.P11L but mitigated by p.I340M, thus explaining why p.Thr279 is pathogenic just on the p.Leu11–p.Ile340 
haplotype. These data indicate that genetic screenings for PH1 should document the AGXT haplotype, including its components, 
to obtain an accurate diagnosis and possible prognostic information.

1   |   Introduction
Human liver peroxisomal alanine-  glyoxylate transaminase 
(AGT) catalyzes the transamination of L-  alanine and glyox -
ylate to pyruvate and glycine, respectively, an irreversible 
reaction under physiological conditions, using pyridoxal 
5′- phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme [ 1]. In humans, AGT is 
encoded by AGXT , and biallelic pathogenic variants are the 
major cause of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1; ~80% of 
primary hyperoxaluria cases). Reduced activity of AGT results 
in glyoxylate accumulation, which leads to overproduction of 
oxalate and glycolate [ 2]. Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals 
aggregate, leading to nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and 
often kidney failure.
AGXT is expressed on either a major (Ma; ~82%) or a minor 
(Mi; ~18%) haplotype, the latter characterized by a 74 bp- 
duplication in intron 1 and by two base-  pair changes (c.32C>T 
and c.1020A>G) leading to the p.Pro11Leu (p.P11L) and p.Ile -
340Met (p.I340M) amino acid substitutions, respectively [ 3]. 
The molecular and cellular effects of these missense changes 
indicate that alone the minor haplotype is not pathogenic. 
However, AGT-  Mi has reduced thermodynamic and kinetic 
stability, which translates to an increased susceptibility to 
unfolding and aggregation both in the purified form and in 
cellular systems, where AGT-  Mi also shows a reduced half-  life 
[4–8]. Notably, the p.P11L variant creates a weak mitochon -
drial targeting sequence that is not functional on AGT-  Mi be -
cause the latter folds and dimerizes quickly enough to avoid 
mitochondrial import [ 3]. However, when a PH1-  associated 
pathogenic change is inherited on AGT-  Mi, a synergism can 
occur between the pathogenic and polymorphic changes, so 
that a severe folding defect and/or aberrant mitochondrial mis -
targeting arise leading to AGT deficiency and PH1 [ 5, 9–11 ]. 
Synergism explored at the biochemical level indicates that the 
pathogenicity or severity of some variants is influenced by the 
haplotype, such as for the most common PH1 pathogenic vari -
ant, p.Gly170Arg (p.G170R) that is found on the minor haplo -
type [12–14].
Interestingly, the in-  depth characterization of the two substitu -
tions typical of the minor allele has shown that the substitution 
p.P11L is mainly responsible for the increased overall dynam -
ics and reduced stability of AGT-  Mi [8, 15, 16], as recently con -
firmed [17, 18]. Notably, the p.I340M change exerts a stabilizing 
role that partly compensates for the effects of the p.P11L substi -
tution [15, 17], but how it influences the molecular phenotype of 
pathogenic mutations is unknown.
AGT is dimeric and belongs to the Fold Type I family of PLP 
enzymes. p.Ile279 (p.I279) is located in an external region that 
packs against the N-  terminus of the neighboring subunit where 
p.Pro11 (p.P11) is located. The c.836 T>C; p.Ile279Thr (p.I279T) 
substitution is quite common in the general population (0.29% 
in gnomAD v4.1.0), usually on the major haplotype, and it does 
not change the specific activity of AGT-  Ma when expressed in 
bacteria [19]. However, there is anecdotal evidence that p.I279T 
may sometimes be pathogenic, being the second possible vari -
ant in compound heterozygous cases, and in some of these 
cases shown to present with the p.Leu11 (p.L11) allele [ 19–21], 
prompting a ClinVar entry (CodeVCV002681193). However, the 
consequences of the AGXT  haplotype on this variant have not 
been studied. Here, we dissect the haplotype in six PH families 
with p.I279T and characterize in detail the biochemical effects 
of this substitution on different haplotypes.

2.1   |   Materials
PLP, L-  alanine, sodium glyoxylate, rabbit muscle lactate de -
hydrogenase (LDH), isopropyl-  β- D- 1- thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG), and imidazole were purchased from Merck Life 
Science srl (St. Louis, MO, USA). Oligonucleotides for site-  
directed mutagenesis were purchased from Bio-  Fab Research 
srl (Rome, Italy) Sigma. Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA-  
free and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete Mini were pur -
chased from Roche. All other chemicals were of the highest 
purity available.
2.2   |   Methods
2.2.1   |   Genetic and Clinical Studies
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of the Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN (Title: 
Characterization of Monogenic Kidney Stone Diseases IRB#: 17–
005513, initially approved September 8, 2017, last modified April 
28, 2025). All procedures were conducted in accordance with 
the ethical standards of the institution and the 1964 Helsinki 
Declaration and its later amendments. Written informed con -
sent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. 
Families with AGXT  p.I279T identified as a possible pathogenic 
change (Table  1) were typed for the AGXT  haplotype markers 
by Sanger and/or next- generation sequencing, as described [24]. 
Clinical and biochemical data on the affected individuals were 
extracted from available clinical records.
2.2.2   |   In Silico Analyses
Starting from the crystal structures of AGT-  Ma (PDB ID: 5F9S) 
and AGT- Mi (PDB ID: 7NS7) we predicted the structural effects 
of the p.I279T and p.P11L variants using (i) AlphaMissense , 
which scores missense mutations based on the sequence con -
servation; (ii) DynaMut , DDGun, and DDMut , which predict 
the ΔΔG of unfolding upon single and/or multiple site variants; 
and (iii) MutPred2, a machine learning- based method that gives 
probabilistic quantitative predictions about the general pathoge-
nicity of amino acid substitutions and a list of molecular alter -
ations potentially affecting the phenotype based on the protein 
sequence [25].
To rationalize the local effects of p.I279T on the AGT structure, 
we performed molecular modeling analyses through UCSF 
Chimera (alpha version 1.17). Briefly, the dimeric structures of 
AGT- Ma and AGT- Mi (5F9S and 7NS7) were used as templates 
to predict the structures of the variants using the Structure 
Editing tool, and the possible steric clashes/contacts with resi -
dues on a 5 Å range using the Structure Analyses tool.

2.2.3   |   Site- Directed Mutagenesis
The pTrcHis2A-  AGT- Ma, pTrcHis2A-  AGT- Mi, pcDNA3.1- 
AGT- Ma, and pcDNA3.1AGT-  Mi vectors for the expression 
of AGT-  Ma and AGT-  Mi in bacterial and mammalian cells 
were already available [ 1]. Each variant was introduced by 
site- directed mutagenesis using the Phusion Hot Start II 
High- Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). We used the mutagenic primers 5’ 
GCTGCTGGTGACCCCCCTCAAGGCCCTGCTCAAGC 
3′ and its complement to introduce p.P11L on AGT-  Ma 
(AGT- L11). We then used the mutagenic primers 
5’AGAGAGAGCCTGGCCCTCACTGCGGAACAG 3′ and its 
complement to introduce p.I279T onto three different back -
grounds (T279-  Ma, T279-  Mi and T279-  L11). A complete list of 
the haplotypes is reported in Table  2. The thermal profile, di -
gestion of PCR products with DpnI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA), and transformation of DH5α E. coli  cells 
were performed as previously described [ 1]. Plasmids were ex -
tracted using the GenElute miniprep kit (Merck Life Science 
S.r.l, St. Louis, MO, USA). The correct introduction of each 
variant was verified by Sanger sequencing (Bio-  Fab Research 
S.r.l, Rome, Italy) followed by sequence analysis using Chromas 
(V2.6.6, Technelysium Pty Ltd., South Brisbane, QLD, Australia).
2.2.4   |   Protein Expression and Purification
AGT- Ma, AGT- Mi, AGT- L11, and the p.I279T mutant proteins 
(T279- Ma, T279-  Mi, T279-  L11) in their His-  tagged form were 
expressed in E. coli  BL21(DE3) cells grown in Luria broth me -
dium at 37°C. Expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 
15 h at 30°C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mM 
NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (buffer A) plus 
100 μM PLP pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor cocktail cOmplete 
ULTRA tablets. Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 
0.2 mg/mL, and the culture was incubated for 15 min at room 
temperature. After freezing at − 80°C, thawed lysate was centri -
fuged at 18000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded 
on a HisPrep FF 16/10 (GE Healthcare, United States) column 
previously equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was eluted 
using a linear gradient of 0%–100% 20 mM NaH 2PO4, 500 mM 
NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 in 100 mL, and the fractions 
containing AGT were pooled, reconstituted with 100 μM PLP, 
concentrated, and dialyzed in 100 mM potassium phosphate 
(KP) buffer, pH 7.4, using Amicon Ultra (Millipore, Germany). 
Protein concentration was determined using the molar extinc -
tion coefficient of 95 400 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm [26]. The PLP con -
tent was determined by releasing the coenzyme in 0.1 M NaOH 
and using the molar extinction coefficient of 6600 M−1 cm−1 at 
388 nm.
2.2.5   |   Activity Assays
AGT transaminase activity was determined by a spectropho -
tometric assay based on the use of LDH as a coupled enzyme 
[27]. A typical mixture contained 0.1–0.2 μM purified proteins 
or 80 μg cellular lysate, 200 μM PLP, and 10 mM glyoxylate, 
in 100 mM KP pH 7.4, and the reaction was started by adding 
0.5 M L-  alanine. The mixture was incubated for 10–20 min 
at 25°C, and the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroace -
tic acid (TCA) 10% (v/v). Pyruvate production was quantified 
in 370 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3 buffer in the presence of 360 μM 
NADH and 13 μg/mL LDH by monitoring the change in absor -
bance at 340 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of NADH 
(6220 M−1 cm−1). Kinetic parameters were measured by vary -
ing the L-  alanine concentration in the presence of a fixed con -
centration of glyoxylate and vice versa and fitting the data to a 
Michaelis–Menten equation.
2.2.6   |   Spectrophotometric 
and Spectrofluorometric Analyses
Absorption spectra were registered using a Jasco V-  750 spec -
trophotometer (Jasco Europe S.r.l., Cremella, LC) at a protein 
concentration of 0.5–1 mg/mL. Fluorescence spectra were reg -
istered by an FP8200 Jasco spectrofluorometer using 5 nm 
bandwidths at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Spectra of 
samples containing all components except AGT (blanks) were 
taken immediately prior to the measurements of samples con -
taining enzyme. CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-  810 
spectropolarimeter with a thermostatically controlled cell com -
partment at 25°C. For near- UV and visible wavelengths, protein 
concentration was 1–2 mg/mL in the presence of 20 μM PLP in a 
cuvette with a 1 cm path length. For far-  UV CD measurements, 
protein concentration was 0.1 mg/mL, and the path length was 
0.1 cm.
2.2.7   |   Stability Studies
AGT- Ma, AGT-  Mi, AGT-  L11, and the T279 mutants at 
0.1–0.2 μM protein concentration were incubated at 37°C 
in 100 mM KP pH 7.4 in the presence of 200 μM PLP, and the 
time- dependent changes in enzymatic activity were measured. 
To evaluate the transition midpoints of thermal denaturation, 
the enzymes (0.1 mg/mL) in 100 mM KP pH 7.4 were incubated 
with 1X SYPRO Orange Probe (5000X in DMSO, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a Jasco FP-  8200 spectrofluo -
rometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 490 nm 
and 530 nm, respectively. Continuous temperature increases 
from 25°C to 100°C with a ramp increment of 2.1°C/min was 
applied, and fluorescence was registered every 0.5 s. A control 
with all mixture components but the protein was also included 
as a blank for each measurement. Turbidimetry experiments

were carried out by measuring the time-  dependent changes in 
absorbance at 600 nm of 10 μM protein in the presence of 10 μM 
PLP in PBS 1X, in a final volume of 200 μL using a MultiSkan 
SkyHigh microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,

7.5 μg of each protein were incubated with proteinase K at a 
100:1 (w/w) protein/protease ratio at 25°C in 100 mM KP, pH 7.4. 
At different time points (2, 5, 15, 30, and 50 min), aliquots were 
removed, denatured in sample buffer 4× (1 M Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 
50% glycerol, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% bromophenol blue, 
and 4% β-  mercaptoethanol) boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a 
12% SDS- PAGE gel. The gel was stained with the Colloidal Blue 
Staining Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 
destained with water overnight, and finally, visualized using

2.2.8   |   Cell Culture, Cell Transfection, 
and Immunoblot Analysis
AGXT1- KO HepG2 and CHO cells were maintained as pre -
viously described [ 28, 29 ]. AGXT1- KO HepG2 cells were tran -
siently transfected with a pcDNA3.1/V5-  TOPO vector encoding 
for AGT- Ma, AGT-  Mi, AGT- L11, and the T279 mutants using 
the GenJet reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, MD, USA). As a 
negative control, cells were transfected with an empty vector. 
After 24 h, cells were either collected using Sample Buffer 1× 
(1 M Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, and 10% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate) at 100°C to obtain the total lysate or lysed by freeze/
thawing (five cycles) in PBS pH 7.2 supplemented with 100 μM 
PLP and the protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche). 
Under the latter conditions, the whole- cell extract was separated 
by centrifugation (13.200 × g, 10 min, 4°C) to obtain the soluble 
fraction. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by 
a Bradford assay in triplicate.
For immunoblot analyses, 5 μg of protein lysate was loaded on 
a 12% SDS- PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, 
and checked by Ponceau staining. The membranes were then 
stained with anti-  AGXT1 (1:1000) in 5% (w/v) milk in TTBS 
(50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) 
overnight at 4°C, extensively washed in TTBS, and then incu -
bated with an HRP-  conjugated anti- rabbit (1:5000) as a second -
ary antibody. Protein gel images were acquired using an iBright 
FL1500 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA). A β - tubulin (1:5000) antibody was used as a loading 
control. Immunocomplexes were visualized by an enhanced che-
miluminescence kit (ECL, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). 
Densitometric analysis was performed using iBright Analysis 
Software version 5.3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA).

3.1   |   Clinical and Haplotype Analysis of AGXT, 
p.Ile279Thr Families
In six PH families (eight affected members) p.I279T was iden -
tified as possibly clinically significant because it was found in 
homozygosity (Family 4) or with a second known pathogenic 
change, without another likely significant pathogenic variant 
identified (Table 1). The affected individuals had clear evidence 
of PH1; three had biopsy-  proven reduction of AGT function, 
and six had kidney failure, from 2 to 57 years. Members from 
three of these families have previously been described [ 21–23]; 
families with two likely AGXT  pathogenic changes plus p.I279T 
were excluded [ 21]. Sequence and segregation analysis of the 
pathogenic changes and the AGXT  haplotype markers, p.P11L 
and p.I340M, showed conclusively in all individuals that p.T279 
was on the AGT- Mi- p.L11 allele. However, further study proved 
or inferred that p.T279 was on a split p.L11/p.I340 haplotype 
(Table 1; Figure  1). Because of strong linkage disequilibrium, 
the AGT- Ma and AGT- Mi haplotypes are normally not split for 
these two markers, with p.T279 normally found on the intact 
AGT- Ma haplotype, where it is functionally normal [ 21]. Given 
the genetic and clinical data and unusual haplotype, we ex -
plored if the haplotype variants influenced the functionality of 
AGT with the p.I279T substitution.
3.2   |   Bioinformatic Analyses of Predicted Effects 
of Ile279 Mutation
Employing AlphaMissense predictions, we found that the 
p.I279T substitution on AGT-  Ma gives a score of 0.22, which is 
compatible with it being benign, in line with the ClinVar classifi-
cation (ClinVar code RCV000186256), previous functional data, 
and its frequency in healthy populations. Then we investigated 
in silico the effect of p.I279T on the overall stability of AGT 
with the different haplotypes (T279-  Ma; T279-  Mi; T279-  L11) 
(Table S1). According to DynaMut and MutPred2, the p.I279T 
substitution caused a decrease in protein stability on AGT-  Ma 
and in the presence of p.L11 alone, possibly associated with an 
increase in protein flexibility. Indeed, in both cases, DynaMut 
showed negative values for ΔΔG, mCSM, SDM, and DUET pre -
dictions, while MutPred2 showed a prediction score of 0.792 and 
0.821 for T279-  Ma and T279-  L11, respectively, thus suggesting 
a high probability of pathogenicity. On the other hand, when 
p.T279 was present on the background of the minor allele, some 
of the DynaMut predicted parameters suggested a stabilizing 
effect and a decrease in flexibility, even if the MutPred2 score 
remained compatible with a pathogenic effect. Notably, no re -
markable differences between the effects of the variant on the 
major and minor allele backgrounds are predicted by DDMut or 
DDGun servers.
Therefore, although in silico analyses mainly suggest a de -
creased AGT stability because of the p.I279T substitution, no 
clear conclusions about its effects and its possible synergism 
with substitutions typical of the AGXT  minor haplotype can 
be drawn.
3.3   |   Molecular Effects of the p.I279T Variant on 
AGT in the Purified Form
To dissect the molecular effects of the p.I279T substitution in 
AGT, as well as its possible modulation by the concomitant 
presence of either of the two minor allele variants, we obtained 
T279- Ma, T279-  Mi, and T279-  L11 in the purified form and 
compared their properties with the corresponding forms lack -
ing the p.I279T substitution. The purity and the identity of the 
proteins were confirmed by SDS- PAGE and western-  blot anal-
yses, respectively. The purification yield of the mutant proteins 
was only slightly lower (50%–80%) as compared with that of 
AGT- Ma, thus suggesting that the variant(s) do not significantly 
7 of 13
impact the expression in bacteria. This is in line with the far- UV 
CD spectrum of the mutated species, which is comparable to 
that of AGT-  Ma, AGT- Mi, and p.L11, thus revealing an analo -
gous overall secondary structure composition (Figure S1 A).
AGT- Ma, AGT- Mi, AGT- L11 with or without p.T279 bind 2 mol 
of PLP per dimer. The CD and absorbance spectra in the visible 
region show the typical bands due to the coenzyme PLP bound at 
the active site, with an absorbance maximum centered at 423 nm 
and a shoulder at approximately 340 nm, attributable to the ke -
toenamine and enolimine tautomers of the internal aldimine, 
respectively (Figure  2A,B) [1]. The Abs 280/Abs423 ratio is simi -
lar for AGT- Ma, AGT- Mi, and p.L11, while it slightly increases 
in T279-  Ma, T279-  Mi, and is approximately 2.5-  fold higher for 
T279- L11. The band of the ketoenamine (Figure  2B) allowed 
calculation of the optical activity (expressed as millidegrees/
absorbance at 410–430 nm), which was 97 mdeg/Abs420 nm for 
AGT- Ma and AGT- Mi, 122 mdeg/Abs420 nm for p.L11, 102 mdeg/
Abs420 nm for T279-  Ma, 84 mdeg/Abs420 nm for T279-  Mi, and 
41 mdeg/Abs420 nm for T279- L11. The lowest optical activity ob -
served for T279-  L11 indicates that the concomitant presence of 
p.L11 and p.T279 could increase the flexibility of the microen -
vironment of the internal aldimine. On the other hand, p.L11 
alone displays an increased optical activity, thus suggesting that 
the single variant at the N- terminus could increase the asymme-
try of the active site. Upon excitation at 280 nm, a characteristic 
emission maximum at 337 nm, typical of a folded globular pro -
tein, is observed for all species but T279-  L11. Indeed, T279-  L11 
shows a 2 nm red- shifted maximum emission peak and a 1.9- fold 
increased emission intensity, suggesting a less rigid anchoring of 
the PLP coenzyme which gives rise to a reduced fluorescence 
quenching, that is, a reduced energy transfer of the intrinsic 
fluorescence signal to the internal aldimine (Figure  2C). On 
the other hand, p.L11 shows a decreased intrinsic fluorescence 
emission intensity, suggesting a more rigid environment that fa-
vors the energy transfer to the PLP-  Lys209 complex. The latter 
changes are not associated with an increased exposure of hy -
drophobic surfaces, as shown by the ANS emission fluorescence 
spectra (Figure  S1B), thus excluding the occurrence of gross 
structural changes.
We then measured the kinetic parameters of the transamination 
reaction catalyzed by each species (Figure  S2, Table 3). All vari-
ants show kcat values of the same order of magnitude, indicating 
that p.I279T is not critical for catalysis. However, T279-  L11 dis-
plays a K m value significantly higher compared with the other 
species, thus suggesting that the combined variants could affect 
the orientation of residues surrounding the active site involved

in the binding of the substrate, translating into a reduced affin -
ity for the substrate.
Overall, the data indicate that p.I279 is not critical for the func -
tional properties of AGT, but its mutation to Thr causes slight 
changes in the microenvironment of the active site, with the 
most prominent effects observed when combined with the 
p.P11L substitution.
We then examined the effects of the mutation on the general 
stability of the enzyme by comparing the resistance to thermal 
stress, the aggregation propensity, and the susceptibility to 
degradation of the p.I279 variant with the AGT-  Ma, AGT-  Mi, 
or AGT- L11 haplotypes. The melting temperatures of each spe -
cies (Table 4) show that: (i) the substitutions of the minor allele 
partly reduce the overall thermodynamic stability of AGT, as 
previously reported [ 8]. However, the main change is caused 
by p.L11, while p.M340 plays a stabilizing role, as shown by the 
7° reduction of the Tm of p.L11 compared with the 4° reduc -
tion of AGT-  Mi; (ii) the p.T279 variant causes a slight reduc -
tion of thermal stability when inherited on the major or minor 
haplotype. However, the concomitant presence of p.T279 and 
p.L11 leads to a more pronounced effect, as demonstrated by 
the more than 20° drop in the melting temperature. None of 
the variants under study increased the tendency to proteo -
lytic degradation upon prolonged incubation in the presence 
of a low-  specificity protease (Figure  S1C). Moreover, all but 
T279-  L11 are stable when incubated at physiological tempera -
ture, ionic strength, and pH. Notably, T279-  L11 is the only 
species that displays a significant tendency to aggregation 
(kobs = 36 s−1), a behavior that is not prevented by the addition 
of exogenous PLP (Figure  2D), thus suggesting that coenzyme 
binding is not involved in the process.
Together, these data indicate that the p.I279T substitution causes 
an AGT conformational change that reduces the overall stability 
of the protein and increases its propensity to aggregation only 
when it is coinherited with p.L11 without p.M340.
3.4   |   Cellular Effects of the p.I279T Mutation in 
Mammalian Cells
We compared the properties of T279-  Ma, T279-  Mi, and 
T279-  L11 with those of AGT-  Ma, AGT-  Mi, and AGT-  L11 
upon expression in mammalian cells. We first chose as a 
model HepG2 cells knocked out for the endogenous AGXT 
gene ( AGXT- KO HepG2) [ 29] transiently transfected with 
pcDNA3.1 vectors encoding the variants under study, and an -
alyzed the AGT expression levels and transaminase-  specific 
activity. The data reported in Figure  3A,C show that AGT-  Mi 
displays slightly reduced protein levels and specific trans -
aminase activity compared to AGT-  Ma, and that p.L11 alone 
leads to effects similar to those observed with the minor al -
lele, in agreement with previous molecular data indicating 
that the p.P11L substitution is the main reason for structural 
changes leading to reduced intracellular stability of AGT-  Mi

[10, 15, 17]. On the other hand, the presence of the p.T279 vari -
ant on each of the three backgrounds leads to a strong reduc -
tion in protein levels in both the soluble and the total cellular 
lysate, as well as to transaminase-  specific activity values that 
do not significantly differ from those of the untransfected con -
trol (Figure  3A,C). Although these data confirm that the con -
formational changes caused by p.T279 strongly impact AGT 
intracellular behavior, they do not provide evidence of differ -
ences based on the genetic background.
Therefore, we expressed the variants in CHO cells, which do 
not exactly mimic the physiological AGT levels and environ -
ment in human liver, but can allow maximized expression to 
possibly appreciate differences among the AGT haplotypes 
with p.T279. The transient transfection of AGT-  Ma, AGT-  Mi, 
and the p.L11 variant in CHO cells gives rise to similar AGT 
levels in the soluble fraction of the lysate, although the specific 
activity of AGT-  Mi and AGT-  L11 is reduced by approximately 
30% as compared with AGT-  Ma (Figure  3B,D), in agreement 
with previous molecular studies indicating that the minor al -
lele slightly reduces AGT intracellular stability, mainly due to 
p.L11. As compared with AGT-  Ma and AGT-  Mi, T279-  Ma and 
T279- Mi show ~60%-  reduced transaminase-  specific activity 
and ~ 40%- reduced protein levels. Furthermore, T279-  L11 dis -
plays just 10% residual transaminase-  specific activity and 7% 
protein levels as compared with AGT-  Ma, thus indicating that 
the concomitant presence of the two variants, in the absence of 
p.M340, could give rise to a synergic impairment of the folding/
stability of AGT.
3.5   |   Molecular Modeling of p.I279T
We performed an in silico mutagenesis study to gain insights 
into the possible structural bases of the synergism between 
p.T279 and p.L11. p.I279 is located on α-  helix 265–283 and is 
surrounded by nonpolar amino acids that define a hydropho -
bic region. The p.I279T substitution introduces a polar resi -
due that alters the hydrophobic microenvironment, probably 
causing a destabilization of this region, without significantly 
affecting the active site that is located at a distance > 10 Å. 
However, the N-  terminal arm of the neighboring subunit con -
taining p.P11 is located in front of the α-  helix 265–283 at a 
distance of 7 Å from p.I279 (Figure  4). Thus, the substitution 
p.P11L can increase the fluctuation of the N-  terminal tail, ex -
acerbating the effects of p.I279T. In addition, structural and 
in  vitro data indicate that the p.I340M substitution exerts a 
stabilizing effect by reducing the overall dynamics of AGT, 
especially in the region comprising p.P11 [ 17]. Based on this 
observation, we can hypothesize that the conformational al -
terations caused by p.T279 in the presence of p.L11 could be 
more pronounced in the absence of the stabilizing effect of 
p.M340.
4   |   Discussion
In recent years, remarkable advances in sequencing technol -
ogies have revolutionized diagnosing rare diseases, making it 
relatively easy to identify pathogenic variants within target 
genes in a proband. Sequence data from large populations of 
normal individuals, such as gnomAD, has also aided differ -
entiation of likely pathogenic from benign changes (mono -
genic disease alleles are rare). However, in some cases, genetic

information is not so clear as to fully prove a diagnosis, in 
particular when the clinical significance of a newly identified 
variant is unclear or there is contradictory data (such as the 
variant being too common to be a monogenic disease allele). 
In these cases, functional studies can be critical to support 
the pathogenicity of variants and provide a definitive diagno -
sis [31, 32]. In PH1, this aspect is further complicated by the 
presence in AGXT  of two haplotypes consisting of p.P11L and 
p.I340M, which can modulate the phenotypic expression of 
other missense changes, potentially affecting their pathoge -
nicity [12, 33, 34 ].
In this work, we studied the molecular and cellular effects of 
the p.I279T variant. At the clinical level, AGXT  p.I279T has 
normally been dismissed as benign because its population fre -
quency is higher than expected for a pathogenic change, and 
experimental data suggest that AGT function is not altered 
when this substitution occurs on the major allele, where it is 
normally found [ 19, 20]. Nevertheless, AGXT  p.I279T has been 
occasionally found on the minor allele, and family data sug -
gest it to be pathogenic, thus implying that the AGXT  haplo -
type could be critical to determining pathogenicity [ 20]. Here 
we strengthen the genetic data with 6 families and 8 individ -
uals with a clear PH phenotype, either homozygous for AGXT  
p.I279T or that have this variant biallelic with a known PH1 
pathogenic change. Interestingly, we describe genetic details 
of the likely pathogenic haplotype, with presumed recombi -
nation between p.P11L and p.I340M, resulting in the p.L11-  
T279-  I340 haplotype proven or inferred in each case. Given 
the distance between these variants and the strong linkage 
disequilibrium, it is possible that a single historic crossover 
gave rise to the rare p.L11-  T279-  I340 haplotype that we pro -
pose is uniquely pathogenic.
Data collected on purified AGT indicate that the p.I279T 
substitution does not cause a gross structural alteration and 
is not critical for the transamination reaction, but it affects 
the microenvironment of the active site when present con -
comitantly with p.L11 in the absence of p.M340, as shown 
by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and kinetic data  [ 19]. 
However, p.L11 and p.T279 synergistically reduce AGT ther -
modynamic stability and increase its aggregation propensity, 
without altering susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage. The 
AGT destabilization caused by the p.I279T substitution is con -
firmed by cellular studies. Indeed, when expressed in a PH1 
model made up of HepG2 cells, all AGT haplotypes bearing 
p.T279 show a significant reduction in specific transaminase 
activity caused by the presence of strongly reduced protein 
levels. Interestingly, when p.T279 on various haplotypes is 
characterized in CHO cells (to maximize expression), the syn -
ergistic effect of the concomitant combination of p.L11 and 
p.T279 in the absence of the stabilizing effect of p.M340 be -
comes evident from the higher reduction in specific activity 
and protein levels of T279-  L11 as compared with T279-  Ma and 
T279-  Mi.
The structural reasons underlying the T279-  L11 synergism are 
likely due to conformational changes of the N-  terminus caused 
by both the p.P11L substitution, which increases the flexibility 
of the arm as already established from structural and molecular 
studies [9, 17, 35], and the p.I279T change, as suggested by our 
molecular modeling studies. An analogous functional syner -
gism between polymorphic and pathogenic changes has been 
previously observed in PH1, e.g., for the p.G170R substitution, 
which is pathogenic on the minor allele [ 9], or the p.Gly41Arg 
(p.G41R) and p.Ile56Asn (p.I56N) changes, whose effects are 
worsened by the concomitant presence of the minor haplo -
type [ 12, 14, 33, 36 ]. However, differently from what has been 
observed for p.G170R (and p.G41R and p.I56N), in the case of 
p.I279T the phenotypic expression of the synergism depends 
not only on Leu at position 11, but also requires Ile at residue 
340. This is indicated by our finding that (i) the p.T279 variant 
has only been described in PH1 patients on the p.L11- I340 back-
ground, and (ii) the molecular and cellular effects of the p.I279T 
substitution are significantly more evident with the p.L11 al -
lele alone than on the minor allele. This effect is because the 
p.M340 variant plays a stabilizing role in AGT. Indeed, crystal -
lographic and molecular dynamics studies have suggested that 
the Ile340-  to- Met substitution could partly counterbalance the 
increased flexibility of the N-  terminus caused by Pro11-  to- Leu 
[6, 15, 17].
From the limited clinical data, it appears that the phenotypic sever-
ity associated with p.I279T is quite variable, ranging from kidney 
failure at 2 years when found with a truncating variant to no kid-
ney failure at 56 years when in homozygosity. Pyridoxine treatment 
has been shown to be effective for some PH1 pathogenic changes 
(notably p.G170R, found on the minor allele) by aiding folding and 
trafficking, and it remains to be seen whether this treatment will 
be effective for p.T279 (on the p.L11- I340 haplotype).
Overall, our results expand the understanding of the molecu -
lar pathogenesis of PH1 by highlighting that the pathogenic -
ity of a variant not only depends on the Ma-  or Mi haplotype 
but can also be differently tuned by the two variants mak -
ing up those haplotypes. It follows that a correct diagno -
sis of the disease, in particular in patients with the p.I279T 
variant, requires a complete analysis of the genetic testing 
results that includes the two haplotype variants, as well as 
family studies to determine the causal relationship between 
genotype and phenotype. In addition, it highlights possible 
modifiers of the PH1 phenotype. This includes, as previously 
suggested if an in-  frame pathogenic variant is found on the 
major or minor allele [ 12, 33 ]. But also rare cases where the 
pathogenic change is found on the split, p.L11-  p.I340 haplo -
type, and when p.I279T on the major allele (0.29% of alleles) 
is found in cis with a pathogenic allele. The establishment of 
more complete genotyping may be of prognostic value and will 
be crucial to implementing personalized medicine approaches 
for PH1.
