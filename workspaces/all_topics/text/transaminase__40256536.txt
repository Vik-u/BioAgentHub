ABSTRACT: A continuous in situ crystallization concept is
presented for the coupled preparative synthesis of L-homopheny-
lalanine and 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline (a cyclized form of α-
ketoglutarate) using the α-transaminase from Megasphaera elsdenii.
The process consists of a spontaneous reactive crystallization step
of the enantiopure amino acid itself and a parallel spontaneous
cyclization of the deaminated cosubstrate in solution. In parallel,
these effects significantly improve the overall productivity of the
biocatalytic reaction. Batch, repetitive, and fed-batch processes
were investigated, and the fed-batch option proved to be the most
viable option. The fed-batch process was subsequently used for a
coupled synthesis approach at the gram scale. In total, >18 g of chemically pure L-homophenylalanine and >9 g of 2-hydroxy-5-
oxoproline were isolated. This optimized process allows for the design of effective transaminase-catalyzed reactions at a preparative
scale utilizing standard (fed-)batch-mode crystallizers.

INTRODUCTION
The use of biocatalysis as a powerful alternative to classical
chemical reaction systems has increased in recent decades due
to their ability to produce highly valuable, often enantiopure
products.
1−4
A major class of biocatalytically derived product
groups are chiral amines, which serve as important
intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agro-industrial
fields.
5,6
Transaminases (TAs) are particularly important, as
they are extremely efficient biocatalysts for the synthesis of
chiral amines and amino acids using only a donor amine and
the inexpensive cofactor pyridoxal phosphate.
7,8
However,
within preparative applications, transaminase reaction systems
often encounter unfavorable reaction equilibria in asymmetric
synthesis.
9
Especially, at higher reactant loadings, substrate
and/or product inhibition occurs, which must be overcome to
achieve efficient process conditions.
10,11
The most straightforward approach is the removal of one or
more (co)products from the reaction using in situ product
removal, e.g., through evaporation or specifically designed
cascades.
12−14
This study focuses on the use of in situ-product
crystallization, which has recently proved its general applic-
ability on a preparative scale.
12,15,16
This concept involves
transferring one or more reactants of the (bio)chemical
reaction equilibrium from within the aqueous solution into
one or more solid phases to reduce the occurrence of product
inhibition. This process itself and specifically the accumulation
of (co)products is entirely controlled by the solubility limit of
the product or its respective sparingly soluble salt.
17
Thus, the
process is intrinsically dependent on the (low) solubility of the
products and required crystallization for general usage.
Moreover, in situ product crystallization can simplify down-
stream processing as it is significantly easier to remove the
product through filtration therefore reducing effort and the use
of auxiliary chemicals.
9,18,19
Additionally, it can be used to
create solutions to obtain enantiopure products from a racemic
mixture.
20
Previous studies have specifically applied sterically
demanding organic carbonic acids or the corresponding
carboxylates, which allows for the targeted crystallization of
chiral amines as its sparingly soluble ammonium salt.
17,21
Although preparative use is feasible with this technique, direct
reactive crystallization is preferred as no crystallization-based
additives are required. An example that has gained interest in
recent years is the non-natural amino acid L-homophenylala-
nine (HPA), which serves as an intermediate for the synthesis
of ramipril, enalapril, imidapril, and others (Scheme 1).
22−27
The biocatalytic process itself is considered significantly
simpler when compared to the original multistep syn-
thesis.
28−33
This is usually done via transaminase pathways,
but can also be achieved with dehydrogenases and β-

decarboxylase.

However, the remaining issue is often
the low atom efficiency due to side-products, which need to be
overcome for this specific enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
36−38
One
potential strategy to overcome this limitation is the design of
combined pathways that facilitate the conversion of all
substrates into usable products, e.g., a coupled synthesis in
which both product and coproduct are valuable.
5,39,40
This is
particularly advantageous if the separation and purification
processes for both components are simple and the remaining
impurities from the biocatalysts step (protein, cell debris, etc.)
can be easily removed.
41
This study presents the implementation of reactive
crystallization of HPA using an α-transaminase at a preparative
scale, starting from 2-oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (OPBA), as a
one-step-reaction concept under optimized conditions. This
includes optimizing the enzyme by implementing a developed
reactor setup to reduce the cost of the process.
24,42−44
The
driving force of this reaction is that the product, HPA, is only
sparingly soluble in aqueous systems between pH 2 and 10.
This naturally leads to a direct crystallization of the product
from the biocatalytic reactions mixture.
35,45
Within the α-
transaminase-catalyzed reaction L -glutamine is applied as a
smart amine donor as it results in a spontaneous equilibrium
displacement of the deaminated coproduct α-ketoglutaramate
(αKGM) via a spontaneous cyclization to 2-hydroxy-5-
oxoproline (HOP).
7,46−48
HOP can be produced in multiple
ways such as vanadium oxide catalysts and L -glutamate
oxidase.
49−51
Interestingly, this coproduct is also currently
being investigated as a potential substrate for ω-amidases in
pharmaceutical research.
47,52
While HPA is directly obtained as
a solid, HOP is isolated independently via a separate ion-
exchanger-based downstream-processing approach, yielding
both products in a coupled synthesis at the preparative scale.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Biocatalyst and Chemicals. All biocatalysts were
prepared through overexpression in E. coli BL21 cells and
used either as cell-free extract or whole cells (recombinant in E.
coli). All samples were used as lyophilizate. Further details
about enzyme origin and preparation can be found in ref 7. 2-
Oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid 98% was bought from BLDpharm
(Shanghai, China), L -glutamine >99% from TCI (Portland,
USA), DL-homophenylalanine 98% from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, USA), L-homophenylalanine 98% from Carbolution (St.
Ingbert, Germany), pyridoxal phosphate 98% from fluorochem
(Hadfield, U.K.), and Dowex 50WX8 from Carl Roth
(Karlsruhe, Germany).
Enzyme Activity Assay. Enzyme activity was measured via
a conversion assay with the help of a comparison reaction
system. 25 mg of biocatalyst was added to a 1 mL solution
containing 50 mM (8.9 mg) OPBA, 60 mM (8.8 mg) Gln, and
5 mM (1.3 mg) PLP. After 30 min at 750 rpm and 30 °C, the
reaction was terminated with the addition of conc. HCl
solution (50 μL). A sample was taken according to the sample
analysis step, and the activity relative to the weight was
calculated based on the produced L-HPA. One unit (U) is
defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of OPBA toward HPA
within 1 min. An average expression resulted in ∼3.0 U/mg
lyophilized cell lysate/whole cells.
Solubility Tests. In an 8 mL Vial, 200 mg of substrate (1a)
and 5 mL of 50 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer solution were
combined, and vials were shaken horizontally. After a few days,
the pH was adjusted and the vials were shaken again until the
pH did not change, for a minimum of 7 days to ensure
equilibrium conditions. Afterward, 1 mL of the solution was
filtered through a sterile filter (0.22 μm) into a smaller glass
vial to remove any undissolved components. The solution was
evaporated until it was dry and solubility was calculated based
on the weight of the remaining solid.
Single Batch Reactor. In a 2 mL test tube, 100 mM (17.8
mg) of OPBA and 120 mM (17.5 mg) L -Gln were weighed. 1
mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 containing 5 mM PLP
was added. After correction of the pH to the desired value, 100
U/mL of catalyst (whole cells or crude extract) was added to
start the reaction.
Repetitive Batch Reaction. A 10 mL batch reactor with
100 mM (178 mg) 1a, 120 mM (175 mg) 1b, and 5 mM (12
mg) PLP was initiated with a catalyst in the form of a crude
extract and operated for 8 h. A 500 μL sample was taken for
HPLC analysis after the reaction had finished and treated as
mentioned below (Sample analysis) but with the respective
volumes halved. The remaining contents were transferred to a
50 mL falcon tube and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min,
and the supernatant was collected using a syringe. A stock
solution of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8, containing 5 mM
PLP, was used to readjust to a 10 mL reaction volume. The
reactor was then restarted with the addition of a substrate,
donor amine, as well as 10% additional enzyme and run for 16
h (overnight). The entire process was then repeated (3−5
days).
Fed-Batch Reaction. In a 500 mL flask, 30 mM (0.53 g)
OPBA and 34.5 mM Gln (0.5 g) were prepared with 100 mL
of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 and 5 mM (36 mg) PLP. To
this mixture, 3 g of enzyme (whole cells, 3.28 U/mg = 100 U/
mL) was added, and the reaction was stirred at 700 rpm in a 40
°C oil bath. In a second flask, 280 mL of the same buffer
solution containing 400 mM (19.96 g) 1a and 480 mM (18.82
g) 1b are prepared. Through a pump 10 mL/h, this reservoir
was added to the reaction over a 24 h time frame.

Sample Analysis. To 1 mL of reaction sample, 50 μL conc.
HCl was added. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and 250 μL
was transferred to 1 mL of a 1:1 mixture of methanol and
acetonitrile. This was vortexed for 30 s and then centrifuged
for 5 min to remove any residual enzymes and undissolved
reactants. From this, 525 μL was added to 975 μL 10 mM
phosphate buffer pH 4. This sample can be further diluted by
adding additional solvents to adjust the final concentrations.
HPLC Analysis. A Shimadzu HPLC system (Ort, Land,
SCL-40, DGU-405, LC-40D, SIL-40C, CTO-40S, SPD-M40)
was used with a Kinetex 2.6 μm C18 100 Å″ Column of 150
mm × 3 mm size. The mobile phase consisted of a 35%
mixture of 1:1 methanol and acetonitrile with 65% 10 mM
phosphate buffer pH 4. Samples were analyzed at 0.12 mL/min
at 40 °C and a runtime of 15 min at a wavelength of 245 nm.
Signals of 2a (7 min) and 1a (10 min) were used for
calculations.
Determination of Enantiomeric Excess. A Shimadzu
HPLC system (Ort, Land, SCL-40, DGU-405, LC-40D, SIL-
40C, CTO-40S, SPD-M40) was used with “Chirex 3126 (D)-
penicillamine” at 150 × 4.6 mm. The mobile phase consisted
of 85% 2 mM CuSO
4
in water and 15% acetonitrile. Samples
were analyzed at 1 mL/min at 40 °C and a runtime of 60 min
at a wavelength of 245 nm. Retention times: 27 min L-HPA
(2a) and 30 min D-HPA.
Product 2a Isolation. The final reaction suspension was
transferred into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at
4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting solid-free solution
was stored independently for subsequent coproduct extraction.
To the remaining solids, 10 mL of concentrated hydrochloric
acid was added per ca. 1 g of raw product. The tubes were
shaken well to dissolve the entire product and subsequently
centrifuged again for 20 min (4000 rpm, 4 °C, to remove all
remaining cell residues). All solutions were combined, and the
pH was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of a saturated sodium
hydroxide solution. The mixture was placed at 4 °C overnight,
and the resulting solid 2a was isolated by filtration, washed
with cold water, and dried under reduced pressure.
Recrystallization of L-homophenylalanine (for XRPD
Analysis). Option A: L-homophenylalanine (100 mg) was
placed in a flask with an additional glass construction on top.
Vacuum was applied, and the solid was heated to 175 °C. After
2 days, pure crystalline needles formed on the sides of the flask
as well as on a needle placed in the middle of the structure.
Option B: L-homophenylalanine (200 mg) was dissolved in
a flask containing a 25 mL mixture of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and distilled water (roughly 1:2; pH < 1).
The solvent was slowly evaporated, resulting in crystalline
needles.
Product 2c Isolation. The solid-free solution from 2a
isolation was collected in a round-bottom flask, and its initial
volume (ca. 300 mL) was reduced under vacuum until about
10 mL remained. The solution was filtered and poured over a
conditioned Dowex 50WX8 column (20 mL), which was
cleaned and prepared with hydrochloric acid beforehand.
Fractions containing 2c were collected, reduced, and poured
over a silica gel column (50 mL), to remove any remaining
impurities, and reduced again. This resulted in 9.6 g (49.7%) of
an orange highly viscous liquid which can be stored in a fridge
for approximately 1 week. To prolong storage time, a lithium
salt of 2c can be prepared by the addition of LiOH and
lyophilization.
7,53
Determination of Potential Protein Impurities. 200
mg of the product was added to a 500 μL solution of 50 mM
phosphate buffer at pH 8, and the mixture was shaken for 30
min. Following this, the mixture was centrifuged, 3 × 10 μL
was transferred to a 96-well plate, and 200 μL of Bradford
solution was added to each. After a 5 min incubation period,
the samples were measured at 595 nm against a blank to
determine the remaining protein content (see SI).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Optimization of the Enzymatic HPA Synthesis. Initial
investigations targeted the fundamental understanding of the
underlying reaction system and its simultaneous crystallization.
The solubility of substrate 1a is especially relevant, as its
availability in the aqueous reaction is crucial for all subsequent
reaction steps. Solubility experiments of 1a unfortunately led
to highly viscous media, which made it challenging to
accurately measure solubility across a wide range of pH values.
However, it was determined that a minimum of 0.1 g/mL will
be soluble most of the time. It is worth noting that 1a may
require a prolonged time to reach solubility equilibrium.
Furthermore, it was observed that 1a dissolves slowly but
consistently, taking on a slight yellow appearance under the
influence of basic environments. Fortunately, amine donor 1b
as the secondary substrate is a conventional L-amino acid that
has been extensively characterized, e.g., Heuson et al. in 2019
for the conversion of 2-oxo-phenylbutyric acid to L-
homophenylalanine. Both products 2a and 2b undergo a
spontaneous transformation that results in in situ-product
removal and thus removal from the underlying reaction
equilibrium. First, 2a exhibits a very low solubility and
spontaneously crystallizes as a white powder. Second, 2b is
independently cyclized to form 2c at a ratio of at least 1:99,
which further supports the shift of the reaction equilibrium of
the product side toward 2a. Both effects basically circumvent
the possibility of substrate inhibition caused by these
compounds, creating an opportunity for scaling up the
synthesis after process optimization. At the beginning of the
investigations, the pH-dependent behavior was examined
(Figure 1) and the optimal conditions for the enzyme were
found to be pH 8 ± 0.5, which is positioned within the typical
range of many transaminases. The behavior at higher pH is also
of interest, as 2a becomes more soluble above pH 10, thus
enabling other process options. This opens up the possibility of
performing the reaction classically without any form of in situ-

product crystallization at higher pH and a subsequent
controlled crystallization using a split reactor and crystallizer
setup.
Furthermore, substrate inhibition was investigated in detail
to support process optimization. Figure 2 shows that higher
amounts of the donor (1b) will improve conversion, as
expected, but only up to a 250 mM threshold. However, a
1:1.2 ratio of 1a/1b was already sufficient for reaching
conversions of over 95%, highlighting the fact that no direct
benefit is obtained in raising the amount of the donor to such
excessive nonstoichiometric amounts. Moreover, substrate
inhibition based on substrate 1a occurs similarly at
concentrations above 100 mM and leads to a rapid decline
in the conversion rate (Figure 3). The reaction system even
came to a complete halt when the substrate concentration was
raised beyond 250 mM. Therefore, it is preferred to run the
reaction at a constant concentration of 100 mM or below 1a to
maintain sufficient reactivity. Figure 4 shows the temperature
dependency of the reaction system with slightly reduced
enzyme addition to compensate for higher reactivities at
elevated temperatures as the applied standard setup was
already approaching full conversions at 30 °C. As expected,
increasing the reaction temperature generally increased overall
conversion (after 24 h). A decrease in enzyme stability needs
to be taken into account at higher temperatures, and thus 40
°C was chosen as a compromise throughout all subsequent
investigations. It should be noted that further improvements in
enzyme stability are theoretically possible via enzyme
immobilization, but were not investigated in detail here, as
any kind of secondary solid phase, besides crystallized product
2a, should be avoided.
Moreover, the tolerance of the catalyst toward the addition
of organic solvents was recorded as such solvent additions are
often considered in transaminase-catalyzed reaction systems
(Figure 5). Some cosolvents do not appear to inhibit the
reaction at all at low concentrations of 20 v/v% or less
(dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol), while others harshly reduce
the performance like acetonitrile and dichloromethane. As no
positive effect was observed while using cosolvents, their use
was not considered relevant.
Under optimized reaction conditions, full conversion toward
2a was achieved within 5 h, which is considerably faster than
many other reported transaminase-catalyzed reaction systems
(Figure 6). This results from the double equilibrium shift in
favor of the products (crystallization of 2a and cyclization of
2b to 2c), which significantly increases the reaction rate. Both
effects also enable the very simple use of more complex
reaction concepts, such as repetitive batch and fed-batch
systems (see below).
Repetitive Batch Reaction. After the initial screening, the
reaction was scaled up to test its viability in a larger reaction
volume, especially as the amount of the solid phase increased
in parallel. This involved a 50 mL batch reaction, being mixed
by a magnetic stirrer and heated to 40 °C, which resulted in a
98.7% conversion after 5 h, thus confirming the results seen at
a smaller scale (see also Table 1 below). To further improve
the overall concept of the reaction system, a repetitive batch

concept was implemented (Scheme 2). This allows for reuse of
the enzyme itself and more importantly the remaining mother
liquor. After each reaction cycle, the crystallized product (2a)
was separated from the reaction solution and the remaining
liquid phase containing enzyme and PLP was then replenished
with fresh substrates to continue the overall reaction. An
additional enzyme was added to replace the inevitable loss of
catalyst activity after 24 h (Figure 7). An exception to the
overall trend is the sixth cycle, with 20% additional catalyst
material after each cycle. This leads to a viscous reaction
mixture due to catalyst accumulation after such a high cycle
number, suggesting that catalyst overload needs to be avoided.
The reaction system was found to be capable of almost
complete conversion for 6 cycles, with 10% additional enzyme
preparation after each cycle, even without the need for
additional enzyme for the initial three reaction cycles,
demonstrating high process stability of the reaction concept
over multiple days. Additionally, the catalyst was not inhibited
by the increasing concentration of coproduct 2c, even at
concentrations of >500 mM. This is important in allowing for
the extraction of this secondary compound to be delayed, thus
simplifying the down-streaming process.
The overall process was further optimized to fit the earlier
shown full conversion after 5 h and transformed to an 8/16 h
refill cycle procedure. The repetitive batch approach was
successful in producing over 600 mM of product within 76 h
(Figure 8, equals 1.1 g 2a) when this shortened replenishment
cycle was applied. In conclusion, a repetitive batch approach
improves the utilization of the catalyst, which remains the most
valuable part of this reaction. However, it results in a laborious
synthesis that is difficult to scale up further. For this reason, the
implementation of a fed-batch reactor setup was tested.
Fed-Batch Reaction. Based on the repetitive batch
experiments, the concept was changed to a fed-batch reaction
system, as substrate inhibition of 1a is the greatest challenge in
this process. The setup was split into three main parts�a main
reactor, a reservoir with dissolved substrates, and the pump�
to continuously transfer these starting materials into the

reactor. The initial conditions were set to 50 mM 1a and 60
mM 1b within a 500 mL flask (100 mL, 1 U/mL catalyst), into
which a constant stream of 40 mM 1a and 48 mM 1b was
added at a rate of 10 mL/h. This setup is intended to maintain
a fast reaction velocity of the catalyst while keeping the
concentration below 100 mM 1a at all times, minimizing the
risk of substrate inhibition. After a full 24 h reaction cycle, the
synthesis was halted, a sample for HPLC analysis was taken,
and both products were extracted from the reaction solution to
be purified (Scheme 3). This concept allowed for the synthesis
of 18.5 g 2a with an enantiomeric excess of 99%. 2c was
extracted in parallel, yielding 10 g. Moreover, both products
were tested for remaining protein impurities and the results
showed <0.1% protein contamination (see the Supporting
Information).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Table 1 summarizes the overall conversion, space-time yield,
and enzyme efficiency of the investigated coupled synthesis of
both products, reactive crystallization of L-homophenylalanine,
and adsorber-based downstream processing of 2-hydroxy-5-
oxoproline. First, the classical batch reaction systems proved to
be simple and optimal regarding simplicity, conversion, and
space time yield, even when trialed at a larger scale (entries 1
and 2). However, enzyme efficiency was improved significantly
when using repetitive batch or fed-batch reactor options as
process alternatives. However, the STY initially decreased
when converting a batch into a repetitive batch for two reasons
(entries 3 and 4). First, there is a certain amount of downtime
involved in refilling and restarting the reactor with fresh
reactants. Second, due to constraints on working hours, the
reactor was operated for a longer duration than necessary to
reach complete conversion (24 h cycles vs 8/16 h cycles with
higher productivity). This was a less significant constraint for
the fed-batch process as it continuously fed fresh substrate into
the biocatalytic synthesis reaction. This concept did not reach
the same STY as a single batch reactor, as the substrate
concentration was intentionally reduced to eliminate any
possibility of substrate inhibition (entry 5, see also Figure 3).
However, due to its simplicity, the presented final concept can
be scaled up as required, only limited by the size of the reactor
and the amount of catalyst that can be provided.
In summary, the gram-scale production and isolation of both
compounds were easily achievable. HPA as a valued
commodity product is an essential building block for the
synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), while the
second product 2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline (2c) is even more
valuable.
