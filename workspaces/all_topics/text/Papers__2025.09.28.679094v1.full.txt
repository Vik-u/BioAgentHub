Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate hydrolases (PETases) are enzymes that catalyze the
breakdown of PET plastic. Previous studies have employed classical molecular dy-
namics (MD) and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations
to probe the catalytic mechanisms of the PETase-catalyzed reaction. In this work,
we apply QuantaMind, a deep learning-based machine learning force ﬁeld (MLFF)
trained on diverse chemical systems and transition-state energies at density functional
theory (DFT)-level, to simulate the complete catalytic cycle of the PETase reaction.
Our simulations capture key proton transfer events and the stabilization role of the
oxyanion hole in PETase, in agreement with previous computational studies, without
introducing artiﬁcial biases to the interactions. The simulations also provide estimates
of free energy barriers for each reaction step with uncertainty estimation, consistent
with experimental values and previous QM/MM studies. To our knowledge, this work
represents the ﬁrst complete DFT-level MD simulation of a biomolecular enzymatic
reaction using DL-based MLFFs.

In troduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most common thermoplastic polymer of the polyester
family, widely used in textiles and food and beverage containers. 1 As a result, vast quantities
of PET waste accumulate in the environment, posing a severe threat to global ecosystems. In
2016, a PET-assimilating bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was isolated from a PET
recycling facility. This bacterium secretes a cutinase-like enzyme, IsPETase, that degrades
PET to mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate (TPA), and ethy-
lene glycol at ambient temperature. 2 Since then, eﬀorts have been devoted to engineering
this enzyme, resulting in numerous improved variants. 3–13
The catalytic mechanisms of serine hydrolases, including PETase, have been extensively
studied. Conﬂicting hypotheses have been proposed with particular disagreement regarding
proton transfer events during the catalytic cycle. 14–18 While QM/MM studies have provided
valuable insights, these methods have inherent limitations, such as boundary issues and lim-
ited accuracy in the MM component, and therefore introduce artifacts and produce diﬀerent
results.19–26 Additionally, QM/MM simulations often require a large QM region for converged
results, which is computationally expensive. 27
Machine learning force ﬁelds (MLFFs) provide a promising alternative by mapping chem-
ical descriptors to the quantum mechanical energy of systems, 28 combining the eﬃciency of
classical force ﬁelds with the accuracy of QM methods. As deep learning (DL) 29 transforms
computational chemistry, several DL-based MLFFs have been developed for MD simula-
tions.30–33 Previously, we developed QuantaMind, 34 a DL-based MLFF trained on diverse
biomolecular fragments with an emphasis on transition-state geometries, shown to be eﬀec-
tive in simulating reactions in aqueous solutions.
In this work, we demonstrate the application of QuantaMind in simulating the complete
catalytic cycle of PETase. Our simulations elucidate key proton transfer events that are
consistent with previous QM/MM studies. We estimate free energy barriers of 22 and 20
kcal/mol for the acylation and deacylation steps, respectively, along the lower bound path.

These
values are close to the estimated experimental value of 18.7 kcal/mol 2,24 and the
calculated value of 21.1 kcal/mol by Boneta et al. 24 To our knowledge, this research represents
the ﬁrst complete DFT-level MD simulation of a biomolecular enzymatic reaction enabled
by a DL-based MLFF.
Results and discussion
Figure 1 provides an overview of the enzymatic reaction simulated in this study. The simu-
lation box (Figure 1A) contains 17,792 atoms in total, comprising the PETase protein (257
residues), one MHET substrate molecule, and 4,898 water molecules. Figure 1B illustrates
the chemical reaction simulated: the hydrolysis of MHET to produce terephthalic acid and
ethylene glycol.
Figures 1C1-6 present representative frames from the simulation trajectories, highlight-
ing key intermediates along the catalytic pathway. Figure 1C1 shows in the initial state
the substrate MHET positioned within the enzyme’s active site. After a nucleophilic attack
by residue S165, a covalent intermediate forms between S165 and the reactant, as shown
in Figure 1C2. Subsequent cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond yields one of the reaction
products, ethylene glycol and the acyl-enzyme intermediate (AEI) (Figure 1C3). As ethy-
lene glycol departs, a water molecule enters the catalytic center (Figure 1C4) and performs a
nucleophilic attack, forming a second tetrahedral intermediate (Figure 1C5). Finally, cleav-
age of the carbon-S165 oxygen bond results in the formation of terephthalic acid, restoring
the catalytic triad to its original protonation state (Figure 1C6). Detailed analyses of the
simulation trajectories are presented in the following subsections.
PETase Acylation Reaction
During the acylation step of the PETase catalytic cycle, the serine residue S165 performs a
nucleophilic attack on the ester bond of the MHET substrate, leading to its cleavage and

the
formation of ethylene glycol and the AEI. This acylation process proceeds through two
distinct steps, depicted in Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2A presents representative snapshots from the nucleophilic attack simulation.
Key interactions during this 100 ps simulation are quantiﬁed by monitoring several relevant
distances (Figure 2B). The hydrogen bonds labeled as H-bond M166 and H-bond Y95 refer
to the distances between the carbonyl oxygen and the backbone amide nitrogens of M166 and
Y95, respectively. These atoms form the "oxyanion hole," which stabilizes the tetrahedral
intermediate during the reaction. Early in the trajectory, when S165 is distant from the
MHET substrate, these hydrogen bond distances ﬂuctuate substantially, particularly for
H-bond M166. As the reaction proceeds, both distances stabilize around 3 Å, indicating
stronger hydrogen bonds.
Another critical event is the proton transfer from S165 to H242 (denoted as H242 NE-
S165 H). A proton jump is noted at approximately 80 ps. Prior to the jump, the distance
between the N ϵ of H242 and the S165 proton is around 2 Å, typical for a non-covalent
hydrogen bond. At approximately 80 ps, this distance decreases and stabilizes around 1 Å,
indicating the formation of a covalent N-H single bond.
QuantaMind MD also provides free energy barriers during the simulation, along with
uncertainty estimates. As shown in Figure 2C, the red dots represent the average free energy
diﬀerence relative to the initial state, with error bars indicating the estimated standard
deviations. The free energy barrier for this step ranges from 22 kcal/mol (lower bound path)
to 47 kcal/mol (upper bound path).
It is important to note that only the S165 O-MHET C distance–the distance between the
S165 oxygen and the carbonyl carbon in MHET–is constrained using our enhanced sampling
technique (Section QuantaMind MD Simulation), with no additional biases applied during
the simulation.
In Figure 3A, representative snapshots from the ester bond cleavage simulation are shown.
Key interactions are similarly analyzed by plotting relevant distances over this 100 ps sim-

ulation
(Figure 3B). The hydrogen bonds, H-bond M166 and H-bond Y95, function as the
"oxyanion hole," stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate and the AEI carbonyl oxygen.
A critical event during this simulation is the proton transfer from H242 to the nascent
ethylene glycol product. As the ester bond breaks, the oxygen atom of the partially formed
ethylene glycol requires an additional proton to become stable, capturing the proton from
HIP242 (originating from S165) to form stable ethylene glycol. The Glycol O-H242 HNE
and H242 NE-H242 HNE distance plots in Figure 3B illustrate this event: at around 35 ps,
the proton migrates from H242 to the ethylene glycol oxygen, stabilizing at around 1 Å,
indicative of a covalent O-H bond. Concurrently, the original covalent O-H bond elongates
to approximately 1.8 Å, consistent with the non-covalent hydrogen bond distance.
Figure 3C shows free energy changes and uncertainty estimation during the simulation.
The red dots represent the average free energy diﬀerence relative to the initial state, with
error bars indicating the estimated standard deviations. The free energy barrier for this step
ranges from 14 kcal/mol (lower bound path) to 37 kcal/mol (upper bound path).
During the enhanced sampling, only the MHET: C-O distance–the ester bond within the
MHET molecule–is constrained (Section QuantaMind MD Simulation), with no additional
biases applied.
PETase Deacylation Reaction
During the deacylation reaction of PETase, a water molecule attacks the ester bond of the
AEI, followed by cleavage of the ester bond between the reactant and S165. This regenerates
the catalytic triad and releases terephthalic acid. The process proceeds through two steps,
illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.
Figure 4A shows representative snapshots from the simulation of the water molecule’s
nucleophilic attack. Key interactions are examined by plotting distances over this 100 ps
simulation (Figure 4B). H-bond M166 and H-bond Y95 denote the hydrogen bond distances
from the carbonyl oxygen to the backbone amide nitrogens of M166 and Y95, respectively.

These
nitrogen atoms form the "oxyanion hole," stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate
during the reaction. Notably, ﬂuctuations in these distances are larger than those observed
for the similar tetrahedral intermediate in Figure 2B.
Another signiﬁcant event is the transfer of the excess proton from the water molecule to
H242 at approximately 70 ps, resulting in a protonated H242 (N ϵ).
Figure 4C shows free energy changes and uncertainty estimation during the simulation.
The red dots represent the average free energy diﬀerence relative to the initial state, with
error bars indicating the estimated standard deviations. The free energy barrier for this step
ranges from 20 kcal/mol (lower bound path) to 41 kcal/mol (upper bound path).
During this simulation step, only the distance between the water oxygen and the carbonyl
carbon in the covalent intermediate (MHET C-Water O) is constrained using our enhanced
sampling technique (Section QuantaMind MD Simulation), with no additional biases applied.
In the ﬁnal step, cleavage of the ester bond in the AEI intermediate (Figure 5A) produces
terephthalic acid and the original catalytic triad. This transition is accompanied by increased
ﬂuctuations in the M166 and Y95 hydrogen bonds (Figure 5B), indicating weaker hydrogen
bonds between the product and the "oxyanion hole." A notable event is the proton transfer
from HIP242 to S165, completing restoration of the original catalytic triad.
Figure 5C shows free energy changes and uncertainty estimation during the simulation.
The red dots represent the average free energy diﬀerence relative to the initial state, with
error bars indicating the estimated standard deviations. The free energy barrier for this step
ranges from 5 kcal/mol (lower bound path) to 17 kcal/mol (upper bound path).
During this simulation step, only the distance of the ester bond in the covalent inter-
mediate (MHET C-S165 O) is constrained using our enhanced sampling technique (Section
QuantaMind MD Simulation), with no additional biases applied.

Discussion and Future Work
In this study, we employed QuantaMind MD, a MLFF trained on diverse high-level quantum
mechanical (QM) data with an emphasis on transition-state regimes, to simulate the complete
catalytic cycle of the PETase enzyme over 400 ps of simulation time. Our simulations capture
key proton transfer events throughout the reaction, consistent with mechanisms reported in
previous studies. 19–26 Distance analysis underscores the critical role of the backbone amide
nitrogens of Y95 and M166, which function as the "oxyanion hole" by forming hydrogen
bonds that stabilize the carbonyl oxygen atom throughout the reaction.
The free energy analysis provides quantitative insights into the reaction activation ener-
gies. Our simulations estimate free energy barriers of 22 and 20 kcal/mol for the acylation
and deacylation steps, respectively, following the lower bound path. These values are rela-
tively close to the estimated experimental value of 18.7 kcal/mol 2,24 and the calculated value
of 21.1 kcal/mol by Boneta et al. 24 Nevertheless, we acknowledge several limitations aﬀect-
ing the accuracy of the free energy barrier estimation. The large error bars primarily stem
from the relatively short simulation time, necessitating longer simulations for QuantaMind to
sample suﬃcient conﬁgurations and converge the mean force. Additionally, in the acylation
step, the nucleophilic attack and C-O bond cleavage may proceed in a concerted rather than
sequential fashion. 19 Thus, a two-dimensional distance scan is required to construct the full
potential energy surface and determine the lowest energy path. A similar approach applies
to the deacylation reaction’s two sub-steps.
Finally, as a DL-based model, QuantaMind relies heavily on its training data. While
the training of QuantaMind signiﬁcantly considers transition-state geometries, 34 additional
training data would be beneﬁcial, particularly for estimating energy barriers. The transition-
state structures sampled in this work provide a valuable source of geometries that can be
further optimized at the DFT level. These calculations can serve as additional training data
to iteratively enhance the QuantaMind model, improving its accuracy and applicability to
serine hydrolase-related biomolecular systems.

Ov
erall, this work demonstrates the versatility of QuantaMind MD as a powerful tool for
simulating enzymatic reactions in explicit water solvents with ab initio accuracy. Beyond
PETase, this framework can be readily extended to a wide range of enzyme classes. Looking
forward, we envision that this MLFF-based methodology will not only complement but
ultimately supersede traditional QM/MM approaches, eliminating the need for artiﬁcial
system partitioning while retaining quantum-level accuracy at accessible computational cost.
With continued reﬁnement, QuantaMind MD has the potential to establish a new paradigm
for studying enzymatic catalysis and biomolecular reactivity.
Materials and Methods
Simulation System Preparation
We began with the crystal structure of the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) variant
(PDB ID: 7W44), 13 retaining only the protein structure after removing small molecules and
solvents. To incorporate the MHET molecule, we used the crystal structure from PDB ID:
7VVE, which includes MHET and a mutant S165A. Speciﬁcally, we aligned the backbone
atoms of the catalytic triad from PDB 7VVE to PDB 7W44 and applied this transforma-
tion matrix to the MHET molecule in 7VVE. The transformed MHET molecule was then
processed with OpenBabel 35 to add hydrogen atoms.
We utilized AmberTools 36 for further processing of the protein and MHET structure.
Initially, we used the pdb4amber tool to clean the PDB ﬁle and add any missing hydrogen
atoms. Subsequently, tLEAP was employed to combine the protein PDB and the MHET
molecule, followed by solvation with TIP3P water using a 5 Å buﬀer distance.
QuantaMind MD Simulation
Following system preparation, we optimized the structure using QuantaMind with the Limited-
memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimizer, performing 1,000 opti-

mization
steps.37,38 The optimized system was then simulated with QuantaMind under pe-
riodic boundary conditions within the NVT ensemble, employing a 0.5 fs time step at 300
K.
To enhance the simulation process, we introduced a biased potential in addition to the
potential energy surface predicted by QuantaMind. The biased potential is deﬁned as follows:
Ubias(Ri, Rj, t) = 1
2k[||Ri − Rj||
− x(t)]2
Here, i and j represent the indices of the atom pairs of interest in the system. The atom
pairs are dependent on the speciﬁc reaction simulated, as elaborated below. Ri and Rj are
the 3D coordinates of the respective atoms. The constant k = 10.0 eVÅ
−2
is a strong force
constant, ensuring the distance ||Ri − Rj|| throughout the simulation. The target distance
x(t) evolves according to:
x(t) =xstart + ⌊ t
10ps⌋
· xend − xstart
10
Here xstart is
the initial distance between atoms i and j, and xend is the desired ﬁnal
distance. The values i, j and xend are determined based on prior chemical knowledge,
detailed as follows:
Acylation reaction-nucleophilic attack: i and j are indices for the oxygen atom of S165
and the carbonyl carbon of the reactant, respectively, with xend = 1.45Å.
Acylation reaction-bond breaking: i and j are indices for the oxygen atom of the partially
formed ethylene glycol and the carbonyl carbon of the reactant, respectively, with xend =
3.0Å.
Deacylation reaction-nucleophilic attack: i and j are indices for the oxygen atom of the
water reactant and the carbonyl carbon of the reactant, respectively, with xend = 1.45Å.
Deacylation reaction-bond breaking: i and j are indices for the oxygen atom of S165 and
the carbonyl carbon of the reactant, respectively, with xend = 3.5Å.

ree Energy Barriers Estimation
Inspired by thermodynamic integration, 39 we estimate free energy changes using the equa-
tion:
Aa→b =
∫ rij =b
rij =a
⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩drij
Here, Aa→b represents the free energy change as the distance between two atoms of
interest, rij transitions from a to b. The term ∂U
∂
rij
is approximated by:
∂U
∂
rij
≈ ∂U
∂Ri
· Ri − Rj
rij
+ ∂
U
∂Rj
· Rj − Ri
rij
This
approximation involves the sum of the projections of the unbiased forces on atoms
i and j onto the vector Ri − Rj , where Ri and Rj are the 3D coordinates of the respective
atoms. Using multiple frames obtained from QuantaMind MD simulations, we calculate
averages ( ⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩avg) and standard deviations (⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩std), approximating the distribution of
(⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩) with a Gaussian distribution:
⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩ ∼ N (⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩avg, ⟨ ∂U
∂
rij
⟩std)
The Gaussian distributions at each rij are then propagated through numerical integration
to estimate the distribution of the free energy change Aa→b.
