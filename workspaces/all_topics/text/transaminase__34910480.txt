ABSTRACT: Shuttle catalysis has emerged as a useful method-
ology for the reversible transfer of small functional groups, such as
CO and HCN, and goes far beyond transfer hydrogenation
chemistry. While a biocatalytic hydrogen-borrowing methodology
is well established, the biocatalytic borrowing of alternative
functional groups has not yet been realized. Herein, we present a
new concept of amine borrowing via biocatalytic shuttle catalysis,
which has no counterpart in chemo-shuttle catalysis and allows
eﬃcient intermolecular amine shuttling to generate reactive
intermediates in situ. By coupling this dynamic exchange with an
irreversible downstream step to displace the reaction equilibrium in
the forward direction, high conversion to target products can be
achieved. We showcase the potential of this amine-borrowing
methodology using a biocatalytic equivalent of both the Knorr-pyrrole synthesis and Pictet−Spengler reaction.
S
huttle catalysis has emerged as powerful methodology for
performing catalytic functional group transfer reactions
and relies on the reversible shuttling of functionality between a
donor and acceptor molecule (Figure 1a).1−3 The method-
ology is an extension of hydrogen autotransfer, 4,5 more
recently referred to as borrowing hydrogen,6−8 and is especially
useful when the shuttled group is highly reactive, hazardous, or
unstable. In the forward functionalization direction, hazardous
reagents (e.g., HCN, syngas) or unstable groups (e.g., HMgBr)
can be shuttledin situ.
9−11 In the reverse defunctionalization
direction, the approach has been used to valorize biomass and
other waste materials and prevent the release of toxic
byproducts.
12,13
While shuttle catalysis has exploited a range of reversible
chemical reactions, many enzyme-catalyzed processes are also
freely reversible, and displacing the reaction equilibrium
toward product formation is often achieved (both in Nature
and synthetically) by performing cascade reactions where the
product of one biocatalytic step becomes the substrate/
reactant for the next transformation.
14−17 Such cascade
sequences enable the construction of complex molecules
from relatively simple building blocks, and the compatibility of
enzymes often means that multiple steps can be performed
without the need for intermediate puri ﬁcation steps. The
reversible nature of many enzyme transformations means that
they can be exploited for mediating reactions in either the
forward or reverse direction, and this adds a signiﬁcant level of
ﬂexibility to the development of (chemo)enzymatic routes.
14,15
An underexplored area of biocatalysis is using enzymes to
shuttle functionality intra- or intermolecularly to generate
reactive species in situ, which can undergo an irreversible,
complexity-building, downstream step. We previously reported
transaminase methodology that transferred amine functionality
intramolecularly, generating a reactive aza-Michael precursorin
situ and negating the need for an external amine donor (Figure
1b).
18 The reversibility of the enzymatic reaction coupled with
the spontaneous cyclization event ensured that only the
thermodynamic product was isolated, rather than a potential
mixture. Kroutil and co-workers reported the reversible
shuttling of a methyl group using a cobalamin-dependent
methyl transferase system.
19
(Co)enzymes represent perfect examples of natural shuttle
catalysts. For example, the nicotinamide coenzymes mediate
reversible hydride transfer through Nature’s complex redox
networks, and the concept of biocatalytichydrogen borrowing
has been derived from this natural shuttling methodology.
20−25
The approach relies on the application of a redox self-suﬃcient
single or coupled enzyme system, where the nicotinamide is
recycled. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is another example of a
natural shuttling coenzyme that plays a vital mechanistic role in
numerous PLP-dependent enzymes, including mediating the
reversible transfer of amine functionality from a donor to an
acceptor molecule in enzyme-catalyzed transamination reac-
tions.

Here, we present a new concept of biocatalytic amine
borrowing via shuttle biocatalysis, using a transaminase to
demonstrate the potential power of this methodology. While
transaminases have been heavily exploited for the stereo-
selective installation of amine functionality, they are associated
with the use of a sacri ﬁcial amine donor to install this
functionality.
26,29 In our approach, PLP functions to shuttle
amine functionality from a donor to an acceptor, generating a
reactive species in situ , which undergo a spontaneous
downstream step to displace the reaction equilibrium in the
forward direction (Figure 1c). This spontaneous downstream
step serves to reunite the borrowed amine with the original
amine donor to build molecular complexity. The introduction
of molecular complexity is traditionally associated with linear
syntheses, where intermediates are isolated and puri ﬁed.
However, new approaches that focus on building molecular
complexity in an atom-eﬃcient and sustainable manner are
highly desirable, and our amine-borrowing methodology oﬀers
a new biocatalytic strategy for atom-e ﬃcient molecular
construction. We demonstrate this amine-borrowing method-
ology using a biocatalytic equivalent of the Knorr-pyrrole
synthesis and the Pictet −Spengler reaction to generate
tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs).
The Knorr-pyrrole synthesis relies on the condensation of an
α-amino ketone with a suitable carbonyl. Mechanistic
investigations carried out by Xu et al. into the biocatalytic
synthesis of pyrroles showed that anα-amino ketone and β-
keto ester could be generated in situ using a commercially
available transaminase.
30 The Knorr-pyrrole synthesis provides
an ideal model reaction to showcase our amine-borrowing
methodology (Scheme 1). The approach centers on the one-
pot conversion of aβ-amino ester (1) and α-diketone (2)t o
the corresponding β-ketoester (3) and α-aminoketone (4),
respectively. In this approach, PLP shuttles the amine
functionality from substrate 1 to 2, generating products 3
and 4, which were expected to undergo a spontaneous Knorr-
pyrrole reaction. Generating the α-aminoketone in situ is
advantageous, as these compounds are unstable to oxidative
dimerization and can readily form pyrazines.
30,31 Our ideal
amine borrowing conditions should employ stoichiometric
equivalents of donor and acceptor, minimize byproduct
generation, and aﬀord the target pyrrole products in high
conversion/yield (Figure 1c).
Commercially available (R)-selective ATA117 was chosen as
a biocatalyst, as it has previously been shown to accept
substrates 1 and 2. Initial eﬀorts focused on optimizing the
enzyme loading, substrate concentration and pH for the
reaction of racemic β-amino ester 1a with α-diketone 2a
(Table 1; seeSI (Table S1)for more details). Despite the use
of 2 equiv of the racemic donor, only the (R)-enantiomer
(therefore 1 equiv) is readily available to the enzyme. A series
of optimization studies (Table S1) suggested that an enzyme

followed by a downstream event to displace the reaction equilibrium.

loading of 5 mg mL −1 at pH 9 and 40 mM substrate
concentration enabled eﬃcient conversion of 1a and 2a to
pyrrole 5a via the intermediate generation of reactive species
3a and 4a (Table 1, entry 4). These optimized conditions were
used for all subsequent biotransformations.
Diketone substrates 2a−f (Table 2 ) were selected to
encompass a broad range of electronic variations on the
aromatic ring, including weakly (2b) to strongly (2d) electron-
withdrawing groups and electron-donating groups ( 2e).
Diketone 2f was chosen to explore the e ﬃciency of the
cascade starting from dialkylα-diketones, as α-amino ketones
are signiﬁcantly more susceptible to oxidative dimerization to
form pyrazines, compared to their aryl-functionalized counter-
parts.
ATA117 showed good conversion (41 −99%) across the
aromatic substrates tested, aﬀording the corresponding pyrrole
products 5a−e (Table 2, entries 1−5). There was no obvious
correlation with the ring electronics and the conversion to the
Knorr-pyrrole products. The poor conversion with alkyl
diketone 1f was anticipated using stoichiometric concen-
trations of the coupling partners, due to the likely formation of
the pyrazine homodimer product;
30,31 however, this potential
side product was never observed. It is worth noting that, while
we did not try this approach, application of both an (R)- and
(S)-selective TA concurrently would enable both enantiomers
of 1a to be converted to3a.
Having achieved good conversions with racemic ethyl 3-
aminobutanoate 1a, we next switched to just 1 equiv of
enantiopure (R)-methyl 3-aminobutanoate (R)-1b (Table S2).
The switch to the methyl derivative1b was solely based on the
commercial availability of this molecule in its enantiomerically
pure form. In most cases, the conversions were broadly
comparable to those observed using the racemic ethyl
derivative. The ATA Knorr-pyrrole cascade with 1b and m-
Cl diketone derivative 2c (Scheme 2, Table S2, entry 3)
elegantly demonstrates the potential eﬃciency of the amine-
borrowing methodology. The PLP functions to transfer the
amino group from the β-amino ester donor 1b to the α-
diketone acceptor 2c, generating reactive species 3b and 4c.
The spontaneous Knorr-pyrrole condensation functions to
eﬀectively displace the reaction equilibrium using stoichio-
metric equivalents (40 mM) of donor and acceptor, resulting
in 95% conversion (80% yield) to pyrrole5i.
Next, we explored amine borrowing for the preparation of
THIQs, using the Pictet−Spengler (PS) rection. This reaction
takes place between aβ-arylethylamine and a suitable carbonyl,
often an aldehyde.
32 We rationalized that it may be desirable to
generate the carbonylin situ, as many aldehydes are unstable.
Additionally, unlike the Knorr-pyrrole example discussed
above, the C−C bond-forming PS cascade will lead to the
installation of a new chiral center, starting from achrial starting
materials. We envisaged using an ATA to generative reactive
intermediates 7 and 9 in situ by transamination of ketone8 in
the presence of amine6, followed by a subsequent PS reaction
to aﬀord the target THIQs (Scheme 3). Previous studies have
demonstrated the mechanistic importance ofβ-arylethylamines
bearing an electron-donating group in themeta position,
33,34 as
they possess increased electron density at the point of ring
closure, facilitating nucleophilic attack of the imine.
Prior to exploring the complete cascade, weﬁrst sought to
ensure that the PS reaction was feasible under conditions
compatible with the ATAs. To explore this,β-arylethylamine
9a, the product of the transamination of the corresponding
ketone 8, was synthesized and exposed to benzaldehyde7a in

the presence of KPi buﬀer (Figure 2A). The groups of Hailes
and Ward have demonstrated that phosphate (Pi) can catalyze
the PS reaction34,35 and it is also tolerated by many ATAs;
therefore, our focus was on optimizing the pH and cosolvent
(see Figure S1 for full details). Our optimization studies
revealed that pH 6 or 7 in DMSO gave poor to moderate
conversion, and therefore, we initially evaluated a range of
solvents and identiﬁed MeOH as the most suitable cosolvent
for the reaction. The PS reaction between7a and 9a proceeded
eﬃciently at pH 6 or 7 when using 10−50% MeOH as the
cosolvent. ( Figure S1 ). At higher pH values, there was
increased conversion to the Schiﬀ base, as observed by GC−
MS, but subsequent ring closure did not readily occur (data
not shown). In all cases, a dr of 2:3 was observed. Having
established reaction conditions compatible with the ATAs,
ketone 8a was reacted with benzylamine6a in the presence of
(R)-selective ATA025 and (S)-selective ATA256 (Figure 2B).
However, conversion to the THIQ product was extremely low
(<10%), and NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures suggested
that the enzyme was not eﬀectively converting ketone8a to the
corresponding amine. This is likely due to incompatibility
between the low pH necessary for eﬀective PS reaction and the
typically high pHs used for ATA reactions (pH 8−10). An
alternative amine donor, vanillamine 6b, was selected and
screened with a small panel of ketones8a-c, using DMSO as
the cosolvent, as this solvent was found to be optimum for the
PS reaction with this amine donor.
A small selection of the data gathered is detailed inTable 3
(see Table S3for more details). As expected, the reaction with
ketone 8a, bearing a NMe
2 substituent, showed very low
conversion to THIQ 11 (entry 1). m-Methoxy-substituted
ketone 8b was converted to the corresponding amine 9b
(32%), but there was no THIQ 12 product detected. The
cascade involving ketone 8c with a m-hydroxy substituent
showed moderate, but signiﬁcant, conversion to THIQ13.A t
40 mM ketone concentration, the conversion increased slightly
as the equivalents of vanillamine were increased (entries 3−5).
In all cases, analysis of the reaction mixtures showed that
signiﬁcant quantities of amine 9c were formed and not
condensing further to the THIQ (entries 3 −6). Relatively
more THIQ formed at higher concentrations (entry 6) due to
the biomolecular nature of the reaction, but overall conversion
began to drop. We also observed likely degradation of amine
9c, particularly at lower concentrations (seeSI Table S3), and
it is likely that this degradation is contributing to the low
conversions to the THIQ products. p-NO
2-benzylamine was
also investigated as an amine donor, as it was thought that the
electron-withdrawing nitro group would aid the PS reaction.
However, the only product observed was that of the
condensation between the p-NO
2-benzaldehyde and p-NO2-
benzylamine. While the ee of the transformation has not yet
been explored, it is likely that the ATA step is highly selective
but that the subsequent PS reaction is not selective. It is worth
noting that we also explored the PS cascade with a small panel
of aldehydes, bearing a m-OH group but only saw trace
quantities of THIQ formed (see theSI Appendix for details).
Despite the moderate conversion observed with these PS
cascades, we believe these reactions represent interesting early
examples of applying amine borrowing to initiate C−C bond
formation and install new chiral functionality.
In conclusion, we introduce the new concept of amine
borrowing via shuttle biocatalysis and showcase our method-
ology using the Knorr-pyrrole synthesis and the Pictet −
Spengler reaction. Our approach centers on the transaminase-
mediated in situ generation of reactive intermediates, which
subsequently condense to generate the pyrrole or THIQ
products. In contrast to the majority of other transaminase
reactions,
26,29 our methodology does not rely on an external
amine donor but harnesses the shuttling capabilities of PLP to
borrow amine functionality from a donor, which is ultimately
returned following a spontaneous condensation. This repre-
sents a positive step toward developing biocatalytic processes
with high atom economy. In our best example, we show that
stoichiometric equivalents of reactive precursors (transaminase
substrates) can be almost quantitatively converted to the
pyrrole product (95%). This methodology has the potential to
be extended to alternative group transfer reactions and to a

regard. The concept of employing enzymes that typically
mediate functional group transfer reactions to generate reactive
species, which can undergo a complexity building downstream
step, has the potential to complement the ever-growing range
of biocatalytic methodology and expand the range of
transformations achievable via shuttle (bio)catalysis.
