Abstract: The (patho)physiological function of the sphingolipids ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P),
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) in articular joints during
osteoarthritis (OA) is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the influence of these lipids on
protein expression by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from OA knees. Cultured human FLSs
(n = 7) were treated with 1 of 3 lipid species—C1P , S1P , or SPC—IL-1β, or with vehicle. The ex-
pression of individual proteins was determined by tandem mass tag peptide labeling followed by
high-resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry after liquid chromatographic sepa-
ration (LC-MS/MS/MS). The mRNA levels of selected proteins were analyzed using RT-PCR. The
3sphingolipids were quantified in the SF of 18 OA patients using LC-MS/MS. A total of 4930 proteins
were determined using multiplex MS, of which 136, 9, 1, and 0 were regulated both reproducibly and
significantly by IL-1β, C1P , S1P , and SPC, respectively. In the presence of IL-1ß, all 3 sphingolipids
exerted ancillary effects. Only low SF levels of C1P and SPC were found. In conclusion, the 3 lipid
species regulated proteins that have not been described in OA. Our results indicate that charged
multivesicular body protein 1b, metal cation symporter ZIP14, glutamine-fructose-6-P transaminase,
metallothionein-1F and -2A, ferritin, and prosaposin are particularly interesting proteins due to their
potential to affect inflammatory, anabolic, catabolic, and apoptotic mechanisms.

1. Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, destructive, and painful joint disease that has been
associated with an abnormal metabolism of joint lubricants. The synovial fluid (SF) of OA
patients bears altered joint lubricant profiles, containing increased amounts of lubricin,
hyaluronan, and phospholipids (PLs) [ 1–3]. PLs in the SF originate from fenestrated
synovial blood vessels and type B, or fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) [ 4]. In a prior
study with cultured human OA FLSs, we demonstrated that transforming growth factor-
ß1 (TGF-ß1) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) induce phosphatidylcholine (PC)
biosynthesis, whereas interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) upregulates phosphatidylethanolamine and
plasmalogens [5,6]. Further, IL-1ß stimulated the release of PC by increasing the expression
of ABCA1 transporters in OA FLSs [ 4]. Notably, IL-1ß concentrations in the SF peaked
in early knee OA (KL score I) and decreased 4 to 5-fold in advanced stages (KL grade
II–IV) [7,8].
Despite these insights, the functions of PLs in articular joints remain inadequately
examined. Using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, our recent study revealed

distinct protein expression profiles in human FLSs that were induced by three slightly
differing LPC species, of which LPC 16:0 was the most active [ 9]. Prompted by these
findings, our focus shifted to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),
and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) in the current proteomic study.
C1P , a ceramide metabolite, is formed through ceramide phosphorylation by ceramide
kinase (CerK), primarily with substrate specificity for C16 ceramides. CerK can be stim-
ulated by IL-1ß and is associated with the trans-Golgi network [ 10]. Unlike S1P , C1P is
not secreted but is released by leaky or damaged cells and exported to the plasma in
exosomes to interact with other cell membranes [10]. In mice, C1P concentrations of 3.6, 4.9,
and 45 pmol/mg protein were determined in neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages,
respectively [11]. Plasma from healthy normo-lipidemic volunteers contains 62 + 20 nM
of C1P 18:1;O2/16:0 [ 12]. As a low-affinity agonist, C1P has been reported to bind to a
possible Gi protein-coupled receptor in macrophages [13]. Whether cells in the articular
joint harbor such a receptor is unknown.
C1P is a multifaceted molecule with diverse functions, some of which are cell-specific
and distinct from those of other sphingolipid metabolites [ 10,14–17]. Balancing the con-
centrations of C1P and ceramide is crucial for cell and tissue homeostasis and the “sph-
ingolipid rheostat” governs this equilibrium with S1P . C1P regulates cell proliferation
and survival [ 16] and, like S1P , is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, whereas ceramides
are proapoptotic [ 15]. In plasma, C1P is believed to participate in the recruitment of
stem/progenitor cells to damaged organs and to stimulate vascularization. Moreover, C1P
mediates inflammation by promoting the release of arachidonic acid through the activation
of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), a critical enzyme in inflammatory prostaglandin
and leukotriene production [18–20]. C1P can synergize with S1P , based on the ability of
S1P to upregulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [15]. C1P also has anti-inflammatory effects in
certain cells and tissues, such as macrophages and lung tissue. For instance, it inhibits the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1ß in human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells [21]. The potential impact of these effects in articular joints merits
further examination.
S1P , a crucial element in intracellular and intercellular signaling, arises from newly
synthesized ceramide or as part of the sphingomyelin cycle or sphingolipid rheostat [22].
S1P binds avidly to G-protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1PR1 to S1PR5), with downstream
targets varying between tissues [ 22]. S1PR1 has been observed during RA and OA in
synovial lining cells, vascular endothelial cells, and inflammatory mononuclear cells of the
synovium [23]. Notably, fingolimod, a modulator of the S1P receptor and an established
therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis [ 24], has therapeutic potential for bone-related
diseases [25].
Most S1P in blood is produced by erythrocytes, platelets, mast cells, and monocytes.
An MS-based analysis of human plasma from 25 healthy normo-lipidemic subjects revealed
a concentration of 530± 90 nM for S1P 18:1;O2 and 290± 90 nM for S1P 18:0;O2 [12]. Serum
reference values for S1P were determined in a cohort of 1339 healthy volunteers, yielding a
median of 804 nM and a reference interval of 534–1242 nM (2.5th; 97.5th percentile) [26].
Most plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M, in association with high-density lipopro-
teins (HDLs) and albumin [27].
S1P is a pleiotropic PL that influences cardiac function, vascular development, vascular
permeability, immune cell function, cancer, and inflammation [22]. In OA, S1P has been
implicated in various processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, PGE2 secretion
via COX-2, and VEGF expression [ 23,28–30]. S1PR2 is the predominant S1P receptor
subtype in human OA chondrocytes, downregulating aggrecan expression and inhibiting
the IL-1ß-induced regulation of ADAMTS-4, MMP-13, and iNOS through the p38 MAPK
pathway [31–33]. S1P also stimulates chondrocyte proliferation by activating extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [34].
Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a multifunctional lysosphingolipid that origi-
nates from sphingomyelin, engages in various signal transduction pathways, influencing

cellular processes. Bearing structural homology to S1P , SPC can bind as a low-affinity
agonist to G-protein-coupled S1P receptors [35] or serve as a second messenger to regulate
intracellular calcium release [36]. The impact of SPC on cellular proliferation and differ-
entiation and its proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties are challenging to
distinguish from those of S1P due to enzymatic conversion by autotaxin [36–38]. Released
from activated platelets, SPC associates with HDL, with plasma levels of 53 ± 30 nM SPC
18:1;O2 and 9 ± 6 nM SPC 16:1;O2, in healthy normo-lipidemic subjects [12,39]. Elevated
SPC levels are observed in such conditions as Niemann–Pick disease type C, metabolic
syndrome, and atopic dermatitis [37,38].
The collective data on C1P , S1P , and SPC underscore their diverse and, at times,
opposing effects on a cellular level. OA is a disease that affects the entire joint, and
ample evidence shows that FLSs undergo significant metabolic changes [ 40,41]. Our
study aims to determine the pathophysiological contribution of important lipids, such as
C1P , S1P , and SPC, to these metabolic alterations. Modern proteomic analyses have been
instrumental in identifying the intricate functions and interactions of these lipids. Using a
recently introduced multiplex proteomic method, several samples were determined by a
simultaneous and semi-quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. Specifically, we set out
to discern the varying effects of C1P , S1P , and SPC and differentiate them from those that
are induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1ß. In addition, the concentrations of
these lipids in the SF were quantified by MS, which, other than for S1P , have not been
reported. This research constitutes a significant advance in understanding the complex lipid
interactions within articular joints, providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology
of OA.
2. Results
2.1. Regulated Proteins Identified by MS
A total of 4930 master proteins were determined in the extracted FLS using MS. A
master protein is a protein with the longest sequence, if more than one protein in a group
has the same peptide score, an equal number of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs), and an
equal number of peptides. In addition, these key proteins were identified using an FDR
of below 0.01, an HT-Sequest score exceeding 30, and the detection of at least one unique
peptide for each protein. Furthermore, we excluded contaminants, per the database of
Thermo Fisher Scientific. To be included in our analyses as a reproducibly regulated master
protein, at least 11 of the 14 replicates in each treatment group had to be stimulated by
more than 1.2-fold or downregulated by less than 0.8-fold.
C1P was the most active lipid species that was tested—followed by S1P and
SPC—given that it reproducibly and significantly regulated 9 proteins (1 and 0 proteins for
S1P and SPC, respectively) (Figure 1). The 9 proteins (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q15043,
P47712, Q7Z7M4, O60488, Q5NKV8, A0A0S2Z4X9) were only upregulated reproducibly
by C1P , as was 1 protein (Q4EZA9) by S1P (Figure 2, Table S1). The concentrations of
5 proteins, although unreproducible, were significantly increased (P47712, Q7Z7M4, O60488,
Q5NKV8, A0A0S2Z4X9) by S1P , whereas 1 protein (Q4EZA9) was unreproducibly but
significantly stimulated by SPC (Figure 2, Table S1). Compared with IL-1ß, the levels of the
9 reproducibly regulated proteins were significantly lower in C1P-treated FLSs, although
C1P and IL-1ß reproducibly and significantly upregulated them versus untreated controls
(Figure 1, Table S1).
In the presence of IL-1ß, which plays an important role in the pathophysiology of OA,
all three lipid species had an additional effect (Figure 1, Table S2). Under these conditions,
C1P reproducibly and significantly regulated 10 proteins (P02795, P04733, A0A6I8PLD9,
P42677, Q71UM5, A0A024QYX3, P62841, B4DLF7, A0A384MDR3, Q6NS36) compared
with IL-1ß-treated controls (Figure 1, Table S2). Moreover, S1P and SPC reproducibly and
significantly regulated 13 (P02795, P04733, P09038-1, D6W5K2, Q59EN5, A0A6I8PLD9,
O60476, P30048, Q8N5Y3, B4DLF7, Q96FJ2, A0A384MDR3, Q6NS36) and 8 proteins (P02795,
P04733, A0A6I8PLD9, A0A024QYX3, P30048, B4DLF7, Q96FJ2, Q6NS36), respectively, with

IL-1ß versus IL-1ß alone (Table S2). Similarly, some proteins were significantly but not
reproducibly regulated by S1P and SPC in the presence of IL-1ß compared with FLSs
that were treated with IL-1ß alone (Table S2). Conversely, IL-1ß, which was added alone,
reproducibly regulated 136 proteins (Figure 1). The levels of 119 proteins were consistently
higher on average by more than 1.2-fold, and those of 17 proteins decline on average by
less than 0.80-fold.

In comparing the ARs of the three lipids in the presence of IL-1ß, they differed
markedly in the number of significantly and reproducibly regulated proteins but less
so with regard to their levels (Figure 1, Table S2). Thus, in the presence of IL-1ß, only C1P—
not S1P or SPC—significantly and reproducibly regulates 3 proteins (P42677, Q71UM5,
P62841), and only S1P does so with 5 proteins (P09038-1, D6W5K2, Q59EN5, O60476,
Q8N5Y3) (Figure 1, Table S2). In the presence of IL-1ß, SPC also develops a specific expres-
sion profile that differs from those of C1P and S1P in terms of the number of significantly
and reproducibly regulated proteins (Figure 1, Table S2).

replicates. The dot plots represent the data obtained from the resulting 14 replicates and illustrate the

controls (which are normalized to 1 and shown as a dotted line). The mean value ± SD is represented
by lines within each figure (n = 7). * 0.05 ≥ p > 0.01; ** 0.01 ≥ p > 0.001; *** p ≥ 0.001.
2.2. Regulated Proteins and Their Potential Biological Functions in FLS
According to the GO Slim categories used for annotating biological processes, the
majority of the 9 proteins significantly and consistently regulated by C1P are associated with
stress response and organization (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q7Z7M4), cellular component
organization (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1), transport (Q7LBR1, Q15043, P47712), protein
metabolism (P08254, Q7LBR1), signal transduction (P09341, Q15043), response to reactive
oxygen species (P08254, Q7Z7M4), cell adhesion (Q5NKV8), cell cycle (Q7LBR1), and
neutrophil chemotaxis (P09341) (Figure 3).
For the annotation of molecular functions, C1P modulated the level of proteins that
participate in intracellular anatomic structure (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q15043, P47712,
Q7Z7M4, O60488), protein binding (P09341, Q7LBR1, Q5NKV8), metal ion binding (P08254,
P47712, Q7Z7M4), and signal transduction (P09341, Q5NKV8) (Figure 4).

ICAM-1, and glutamine fructose-6-Ptransaminase were quantiﬁed by MS in duplicate in the 7 bio-
logical replicates. The dot plots represent the data  obtained from the resulting 14 replicates and 
illustrate the x-fold abundance of the proteins in the treated FLS cells in comparison to that of only 
vehicle-treated controls (which are normalized to 1 and shown as a do tted line). The mean value ± 
SD is represented by lines within each ﬁgure (n = 7). * 0.05 ≥ p > 0.01; ** 0.01 ≥ p > 0.001; *** p ≥ 0.001. 
In the presence of IL-1ß, which plays an important role in the pathophysiology of 
OA, all three lipid species had an additional e ﬀect (Figure 1, Table S2). Under these con-
ditions, C1P reproducibly and signi ﬁcantly regulated 10 proteins (P02795, P04733, 
A0A6I8PLD9, P42677, Q71UM5, A0A024QYX3, P62841, B4DLF7, A0A384MDR3, Q6NS36) 
compared with IL-1ß-treated controls (Figure 1, Table S2). Moreover, S1P and SPC repro-
ducibly and signi ﬁcantly regulated 13 (P02795, P04733, P09038-1, D6W5K2, Q59EN5, 
A0A6I8PLD9, O60476, P30048, Q8N5Y3, B4DLF7, Q96FJ2, A0A384MDR3, Q6NS36) and 8 
proteins (P02795, P04733, A0A6I8PLD9, A0A024QYX3, P30048, B4DLF7, Q96FJ2, 
Q6NS36), respectively, with IL-1ß versus IL-1ß alone (Table S2). Similarly, some proteins 
were signiﬁcantly but not reproducibly regulated by S1P and SPC in the presence of IL-
1ß compared with FLSs that were treated with  IL-1ß alone (Table S2). Conversely, IL-1ß, 
which was added alone, reproducibly regulated 136 proteins (Figure 1). The levels of 119 
proteins were consistently higher on average by more than 1.2-fold, and those of 17 pro-
teins decline on average by less than 0.80-fold. 
In comparing the ARs of the three lipids in the presence of IL-1ß, they diﬀered mark-
edly in the number of signi ﬁcantly and reproducibly regulated proteins but less so with 
regard to their levels (Figure 1, Table S2). Thus, in the presence of IL-1ß, only C1P—not 
S1P or SPC—signi ﬁcantly and reproducibly regulates 3 proteins (P42677, Q71UM5, 
P62841), and only S1P does so with 5 pr oteins (P09038-1, D6W5K2, Q59EN5, O60476, 
Q8N5Y3) (Figure 1, Table S2). In the pres ence of IL-1ß, SPC also develops a speci ﬁc ex-
pression proﬁle that diﬀers from those of C1P and S1P in terms of the number of signi ﬁ-
cantly and reproducibly regulated proteins (Figure 1, Table S2).  
2.2. Regulated Proteins and Their Potential Biological Functions in FLS 
According to the GO Slim categories used for annotating biological processes, the 
majority of the 9 proteins signi ﬁcantly and consistently regu lated by C1P are associated 
with stress response and organization (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q7Z7M4), cellular com-
ponent organization (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1), transport (Q7LBR1, Q15043, P47712), pro-
tein metabolism (P08254, Q7LBR1), signal transduction (P09341, Q15043), response to re-
active oxygen species (P08254, Q7Z7M4), cell  adhesion (Q5NKV8), cell cycle (Q7LBR1), 
and neutrophil chemotaxis (P09341) (Figure 3).  
For the annotation of molecular functions, C1P modulated the level of proteins that 
participate in intracellular anatomic structure (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q15043, P47712, 
Q7Z7M4, O60488), protein binding (P09341, Q7LBR1, Q5NKV8), metal ion binding 
(P08254, P47712, Q7Z7M4), and signal transduction (P09341, Q5NKV8) (Figure 4).

S1P signiﬁcantly and reproducibly regulated only 1 protein (Q4EZA9, cytochrome c 
oxidase subunit 1), which is involved in transport and other metabolic and biological pro-
cesses, with its molecular functions including transporter activity, intracellular anatomical 
structure, oxidoreductase activity, and metal ion binding. Q4EZA9 has been described as

The differentially expressed proteins that were induced by C1P resided in several cellu-
lar structures, including parts of the cytoplasm (P09341, P08254, Q7LBR1, Q15043, P47712,
Q7Z7M4, O60488), other membranes (Q7ZLBR1, Q15043, P47712, O60488, Q5NKV8),
plasma membrane (Q7LBR1, Q15043, O60488, Q5NKV8), mitochondria (P47712, Q7Z7M4,
O60488), nucleus (P08254, Q7LBR1, P47712), other cytoplasmatic organelles (Q7LBR1,
Q15043, O60488), cytosol (Q7LBR1, P47712), ER/Golgi (P47712, O60488), extracellular
regions (P09341, P08254), lysosomes (Q7LBR1, Q15043), and the nonstructural extracellular
(P09341) and extracellular matrix (P08254) (Figure 5).
S1P significantly and reproducibly regulated only 1 protein (Q4EZA9, cytochrome
c oxidase subunit 1), which is involved in transport and other metabolic and biological
processes, with its molecular functions including transporter activity, intracellular anatomi-
cal structure, oxidoreductase activity, and metal ion binding. Q4EZA9 has been described
as a cellular component of mitochondria, the cytoplasm, and other cell compartments
and membranes.
IL-1ß reproducibly regulated 136 proteins by more than 1.2-fold or less than 0.8-fold
on average. All 9 proteins being significantly and reproducibly modulated by C1P were
also consistently regulated by IL-1ß (Figure 1, Table S1). Notably, the three lipid species
had additional stimulatory or inhibitory effects on protein expression in FLSs that were
treated with IL-1ß. As such, 2 of 10 proteins (P02795, P04743) were consistently and
markedly regulated by C1P in the presence of IL-1ß, similar to FLSs treated solely with

IL-1ß, albeit lacking reproducibility; however, the expression of the other eight proteins
were reproducibly stimulated or inhibited only by C1P in the presence of IL-1ß but not by
IL-1ß alone (Table S2). Thus, the affected biological processes, molecular functions, and
location within cellular structures of proteins of FLSs that were treated with C1P in the
presence of IL-1ß differed markedly from those that were identified by the applied GO Slim
categories for C1P that was administered alone (Figures S1–S3).

The mRNA expression was compared with the levels of some regulated proteins.
For this purpose, 11 proteins that were reproducibly or significantly regulated by at least

analysis of 42 comparisons between the average AR and average fold-change in mRNA
expression yielded a Spearman correlation coefficient of r = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.82;

tection (6 pmol/mL). However, we reliably determined the concentrations of C1P 16:0 and

or lOA (C1P: 13.3 ± 7.4 pmol/mL; SPC 9.3 ± 3.1 pmol/mL). Also, as seen in Figure 6,
the levels appear to be independent of disease stage. Unfortunately, none of the three
sphingolipids could be detected in the SF of joint-healthy controls due to the dilutions that
were performed in our laboratory.

3. Discussion
Sphingolipids have critical functions in structural integrity and cellular signaling in
eukaryotic cells. However, our understanding of C1P , S1P , and SPC in articular joints is
limited. Receptors for these sphingolipids have been identified on various cells, including
chondrocytes, prompting an examination of their effects on articular cells, such as FLSs.
Using novel MS technology, we quantified the impact of these sphingolipids on protein
expression in FLSs. C1P emerged as the most active lipid, followed by S1P and SPC.
Whereas C1P and S1P significantly regulated 9 proteins and 1 protein, respectively, SPC
had no effect. Such variations in efficacy may be attributed to differential binding receptors,
although their presence on FLSs requires confirmation [13,30,31].
A prior study on LPCs [9] confirmed the pleiotropic effects of IL-1ß on FLSs. Given
our focus on sphingolipids, we abstained from re-evaluating the impact of IL-1ß on protein
expression. However, its involvement in the biochemical pathways of various articular
cells, including chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, has been
extensively documented [ 9,42,43]. Notably, IL-1ß has proinflammatory activity in the
pathogenesis of OA, particularly its early stages [ 7,8]. Thus, we examined sphingolipid
levels in the presence of IL-1ß, observing the significant and reproducible regulation of
additional proteins, indicating lipid-specific effects on expression profiles.
In this study, we also quantified C1P , S1P , and SPC in the SF of 8 eOA and 10 lOA
patients using LC-MS/MS. We could not detect any S1P , because its values were beneath
the limit of detection (6 pmol/mL), whereas those of C1P 16:0 and SPC 18:1;O2 in all
OA patients averaged 17.3 ± 14.4 pmol/mL and 8.6 ± 3.6 pmol/mL, respectively. Com-
pared with their plasma levels in normo-lipidemic patients (C1P: 62 ± 20 pmol/mL,
S1P: 530 ± 90 pmol/mL, SPC 18:1;O2: 53 ± 30 pmol/mL), the concentrations of sphin-
golipids in the SF are notably lower [12]. Despite adding 5% FBS to our cell culture media
and assuming similar levels as in human serum, only minimal amounts of the three sph-
ingolipids were added through FBS. Consequently, the applied lipid concentration of
1 nmol/mL for cultured FLSs far exceeds such concentrations in the SF, ensuring that the
possible effects were maximized. However, additional studies are warranted to analyze the
concentration-dependent effects that were observed.
Many proteins underwent consistent and significant stimulation (>1.2-fold) or inhi-
bition (<0.8-fold) by the three sphingolipids. Each protein was analyzed twice by MS in
7 biological replicates, yielding data from 14 replicates per treatment. This meticulous
approach was essential, because preliminary experiments indicated limited reproducibility
between biological and technical replicates in MS data. Consequently, only those proteins
exhibiting consistent directional regulation in at least 11 of the 14 replicates were viewed as
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 8363 9 of 17
being reproducible. This criterion ensured the reliability of our assessments of the effects
of lipids.
Quantitative RT-PCR and WB were performed to analyze several proteins that ex-
hibited significant and reproducible regulation. In our correlation analysis, there was a
moderate correlation (r = 0.68) between the average ARs of select proteins and their corre-
sponding mRNA levels. This observation aligns with previous findings that have indicated
a limited correlation between mRNA and protein data due to technical and biological
factors [44,45].
Our primary focus in this study was to identify proteins that were significantly reg-
ulated in OA with potential pathophysiological relevance. Among them was matrix
metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3; P08254), which has a well-established role in the pathophysi-
ology of OA [46,47]. Notably, our findings demonstrated that only C1P significantly and
reproducibly stimulated MMP-3 expression, albeit to a lesser extent than IL-1ß, a known
regulator of MMP-3. MMP-3, also referred to as stromelysin-1, has a broad substrate
specificity for extracellular matrix components, such as proteoglycans. It contributes to
the progressive degradation of articular cartilage in OA [46]. Since 2003, researchers have
postulated that maintaining a balance between MMPs and their natural tissue inhibitors
of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is critical to the integrity of the extracellular matrix [ 47].
In this context, our results suggest a potential catabolic effect of C1P based on the find-
ing that it upregulates MMP-3; thus this delicate balance is potentially disrupted in the
extracellular matrix.
C1P also has anti-catabolic effects, increasing the generation of superoxide dismutase
(SOD2, Q7Z7M4), like IL-1ß. This enzyme (EC: 1.5.1.1) catalyzes the formation of hydrogen
peroxide from superoxide anion radicals inside and outside of the cells; hydrogen peroxide
is less harmful and is further degraded by reduction [ 48,49]. It is assumed that age-
related mitochondrial dysfunction, accompanied by the reduced formation of mitochondrial
superoxide dismutase, occurs, favoring the mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen
species in chondrocytes that damage articular cartilage [48,49].
This protective effect of C1P is also reflected in the presumed anti-apoptotic effect of
charged multivesicular body protein 1b (CHMP1B, Q7LBR1), the expression of which is
induced by C1P and IL-1ß. This protein (Q7LBR1) is associated with the endosomal sorting
complex required for the transport-III (ESCRT-III) system, which is essential for mending
injured plasma membranes [50].
Further, C1P upregulates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, P47712), which selec-
tively hydrolyzes the sn-2 arachidonoyl group of membrane phospholipids, supplying
eicosanoid biosynthesis precursors via the cyclooxygenase pathway [51]. Moreover, C1P
is a strong and selective activator of this phospholipase, through interaction with the C2
domain [52]. The increased release of arachidonic acid and subsequent production of PGE2,
also observed for IL-1ß [53], contribute to the inflammatory process in OA, suggesting a
proinflammatory function for C1P in OA.
The upregulation of long-chain-fatty-acid–CoA ligase 4 (O60488) that is induced by
C1P—more so by IL-1ß—is significant in this context. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion
of long-chain fatty acids into their active acyl-CoA forms, vital for lipid synthesis and
degradation. The polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate are its
preferred substrates. Notably, this enzyme modulates the secretion of PGE2 in human
arterial smooth muscle cells [54].
C1P upregulates other proteins that are involved in the inflammatory process and the
progression of OA. Growth-regulated alpha protein, or CXCL1 (P09341), is stimulated by
C1P , as well as by IL-1ß; this chemokine has a similar function as IL-8. After binding to
its receptor CXCR2, CXCL1 activates multiple MAP kinases, and upregulates during and
contributes to inflammation [55]. CXCL1 increases the expression of IL-6 in RA and OA
synovial fibroblasts [56] and is upregulated in OA chondrocytes. Also, during cartilage
development, CXCL1 promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy and triggers apoptosis [57,58].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 8363 10 of 17
The formation of the metal cation symporter ZIP14 (Q15043) and the intercellular adhe-
sion molecule (ICAM-1) is stimulated by C1P and more strongly by IL-1ß. The metal cation
symporter ZIP14 (Q15043) is a plasma membrane transporter that is involved in the uptake
of divalent metal cations, such as zinc, manganese, and iron, and is crucial for tissue home-
ostasis, metabolism, development, and immunity. In particular, it shapes innate immunity
by regulating cytokine expression in activated macrophages [59]. ICAM-1 (Q5NKV8), a
glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, binds to leukocyte β2 integrin and is
implicated in the pathophysiology of OA, mediating inflammation and apoptosis and
possibly facilitating crosstalk between bone and cartilage [60]. Whereas healthy synovium
expresses low levels of ICAM-1, OA chondrocytes have a higher content [60].
C1P upregulated the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT2,
A0A0S2Z4X9), which regulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway [61]. This transaminase
catalyzes the conversion of D-fructose-6-phosphate and L-glutamine into D-glucosamine-
6-phosphate, a precursor of glycosaminoglycans, components of proteoglycans in the
extracellular matrix of, for example, articular cartilage [61]. The significance of alterations in
the expression of this enzyme with regard to cartilage and joints remains to be determined,
as does that of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Q4EZA9), which plays a key
role in aerobic metabolism as an enzyme being stimulated only by S1P .
The two metallothioneins, MT-1F (P04733) and MT-2A (P02795), in addition to ferritin
(A0A384MDR3, Q6NS36), were significantly modulated by C1P , S1P , and SPC in the pres-
ence of IL-1ß compared with IL-1ß alone. Originally linked to heavy metal detoxification,
metallothioneins are now recognized for their involvement in various cellular processes,
such as proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and antioxidation [62]. Elevated levels of MT-1
are associated with erosive inflammatory OA, wherein MT-1 has anti-inflammatory proper-
ties, inhibiting the expression of IL-1ß, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells and synovial cells in vitro [63]. MT-2 is implicated in inflammatory diseases of
the respiratory and nervous systems and cancer [62], suggesting that the pharmacological
induction of MT-2 could confer protection in inflammatory conditions. However, further
research is needed to determine the (patho)physiological relevance of metallothioneins in
joint health.
The need for further investigations also extends to ferritin, a protein that is primar-
ily involved in intracellular iron storage. Ferritin has a particular pathophysiological
function as a suppressor of ferroptosis, a type of non-apoptotic cell death that depends
on iron which has been known since 2012 [ 64]. The downregulation of ferritin by C1P ,
S1P , and SPC in the presence of IL-1ß by approximate 50% thus appears to promote
ferroptosis in FLSs. Further, the functions of prosaposin (Q59EN5) and 40S ribosomal
protein S27 (P42677) in the articular joint remain underexamined. For example, prosaposin,
preferentially stimulated by S1P in the presence of IL-1ß compared with IL-ß alone, is a
65/70-kDa glycoprotein and a precursor of saposins, which subsequently activate enzymes
responsible for degradation of specific sphingolipids [65]. Further studies are needed to
determine the (patho)physiological functions of other proteins that are reproducibly and
significantly regulated by C1P , S1P , or SPC in the presence of IL-1ß, such as thymosin
(D6W5K2), dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide–protein glycosyltransferase (A0A6I8PLD9),
RNA-binding motif protein 3 (A0A024QYX3), splicing factor (A8K644), 40S ribosomal
protein S15 (P62841), thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase (P30048), GYG1 protein
(Q8N5Y3), cDNA FLJ60294 (B4DLF7), and dynein light chain 2 (Q96FJ2).
In conclusion, our study complements the poorly understood pathophysiologic role
of the three major sphingolipids in the joints, of which C1P and S1P have emerged as
the most active. Based on our findings, C1P-stimulated proteins with partially opposing
effects as both pro- and anti-inflammatory and catabolic proteins were upregulated, in
addition to other proteins. Our novel proteomic MS analysis yielded a large amount of data,
showing that the expression profiles of proteins following treatment of FLSs with these
sphingolipids change markedly when the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1ß is present. Thus,
our in vitro model provides a more accurate representation of FLS responses across the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 8363 11 of 17
various stages of OA, particularly with regard to the elevated IL-1ß levels that are observed
in its early stages. Further, our study has identified several proteins that are implicated in
the pathogenesis of OA throughout disease progression, although their specific functions
require validation.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Materials
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen,
Germany). Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA) provided Huzzah® C1P [C16 ceramide-
1-phosphate (18:1;O2/16:0), C1P 16:0], Huzzah® S1P [sphingosine-1-phosphate (18:1;O2),
S1P 18:1;O2] and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC 18:1;O2, Lyso SM 18:1;O2). Aliquots
of a stock solution of each lipid species were prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and stored frozen at −20 ◦C. After being thawed, the aliquots were mixed
thoroughly and used to treat cultured FLSs as described below.
4.2. Specimen Selection for Isolation of FLSs
Synovial tissue was donated by patients selected at random during knee replacement
surgery at the Clinic and Polyclinic for Orthopedics and Orthopedic Surgery (Giessen),
University Hospital Giessen and Marburg (Germany). All study procedures that involved
patients were conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained from the
Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Justus Liebig University Giessen
(Germany). All patients gave their written informed consent to donate samples for research
and allow the publication of any resulting findings. The data presented in this paper do
not allow for the identification of any individual patient.
Donating patients had late-stage knee OA, had to be aged younger than 85 years,
and had to have a BMI of <40 and a CRP level of ≤8 mg/dL. The impact of lipid species
on the FLS proteome was not studied in cells from excluded patients, as detailed in
references [4,5,9], such as those with other joint diseases, a serious illness such as tumor or
HIV , or a severe disease of the kidney or liver.
4.3. Culture of FLSs
Human FLSs were obtained from the synovial membranes of OA knee joints as
described [66]. Briefly, FLSs were cultured up to passage 3–4 in DMEM (PAN Biotech,
Aidenbach, Germany) with supplements under 10% CO2 at 37 ◦C. Mycoplasma contam-
ination was ruled out using an I/C PCR mycoplasma test kit (PromoCell, Heidelberg,
Germany). The purity of confluent FLSs was evaluated using FACS according to the previ-
ously outlined method [4,5] with 94.4% ± 5.8% showing positivity for CD90 and negativity
for CD45.
4.4. Treatment of Cultured FLSs for Proteomic and mRNA Analysis
The practical procedure for the treatment of cultured FLS for proteomic and mRNA
analyses has already been published recently, whereby other lipid species were investi-
gated [9]. Briefly, to analyze the FLS proteome, passage 4 FLSs were seeded in 6-well
plates at 80,000 cells per well and grown to confluence in supplemented DMEM, changing
the media every 2–3 days. Purity was verified by FACS. Cells were then treated with
serum-reduced DMEM (5% FBS) containing folic acid for 24 h, followed by media with
1 µM C1P , S1P , or SPC, and/or 1 nM IL-1ß, whereas controls received vehicle only. After
48 h, the media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and mycoplasma testing was
performed. For mRNA analysis, cells were lysed in RP1 buffer with 1% β-mercaptoethanol
following the manufacturer’s guideline (NucleoSpin® RNA/Protein kit, Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany), subjected to sonication, snap frozen, and kept at −86 ◦C for storage.
For the proteomic analysis, lipid-treated and untreated FLSs from the same biological
replicates were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 0.5 mL lysis buffer, sonicated, and kept
at −86 ◦C for storage.

This procedure was repeated 6 times with FLSs from 7 OA patients who underwent knee
replacement surgery (age 68.3± 1.1 years, BMI 30.4 ± 4.2 kg/m2, CRP 3.1 ± 2.3 mg/mL,
3 males). Some patients had comorbidities, including arterial hypertension (n = 4), hypothy-
roidism (n = 3), hyperlipidemia (n = 2), and fibromyalgia (n = 1). Each of the 7 biological
replicates was analyzed in duplicate, resulting in 14 proteomic data per treatment or control.

The protein levels in lysed FLS extracts were measured and subjected to trypsin
digestion as detailed earlier [ 9,67]. Briefly, tryptic peptides were desalted, lyophilized,
redissolved in 50 mM HEPES, and quantified.
For each of the 7 biological replicates, 10µg of peptides from 8 treatments were labeled
with TMT10plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. Each isobaric reagent was assigned to a specific
treatment or control as described below, using the pooled control sample as a reference for
comparison: reporter ions at m/z = 126- untreated control, 127N-SPC, 127C-S1P , 128N-C1P ,
128C-IL-1ß-treated control, 129N-SPC + IL-1ß, 129C-S1P + IL-1ß, 130N-C1P + IL-1β, and
130C-pool of the 7 untreated controls.
MS analysis was performed as previously described [9,68]. Briefly, labeled peptide
mixtures were fractionated into 8 fractions per replicate. For MS, 1 µg of each fraction
was loaded onto a 50-cm µPAC™ C18 column (Pharma Fluidics, Gent, Belgium), eluted
with a 240 min acetonitrile gradient, and analyzed with an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ionization mode.
4.6. Protein Identification and Quantitation
Proteins were identified and quantified as per established protocols [9,68]. Briefly, data
acquisition was performed on an Xcalibur 4.3.73.11 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). The merged data sets from 8 fractions per biological replicate were examined
using Proteome Discoverer 2.5.0.400 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The
search was performed with Sequest HT, a 10 ppm mass tolerance of precursor ions and
1 allowed missed cleavage. The FDR of identified peptides was limited to 0.01. Identified
proteins required at least 1 unique peptide of 6–144 amino acids.
4.7. Relative mRNA Expression
RNA was isolated and measured with a 260/280 nm ratio of 1.98 ± 0.06 using a Nan-
oDrop™ 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described [9].
Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qia-
gen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA was then assessed in duplicate using QuantiNova LNA
PCR or QuantiTECT Primer Assay (only MMP3) with the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR kit
(Qiagen) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Waltham, MA, USA)
for the following specified genes (Qiagen GeneGlobe ID): CXCL1 (SBH0404660), CHMP1B
(SBH0502633), DYNLL2 (SBH0665947), FTH1 (SBH1220010), MMP3 (QT00060025), MT2A
(SBH0576025), MT-CO1 (SBH0135562), PLA2G4A (SBH056400), PSAP (SBH0480826), and
RPS27L (SBH0138199). The QuantiNova LNA PCR Assay and QuantiTECT Primer Assay
(Qiagen) use predesigned, validated primer pairs specific to target cDNA. Primer effi-
ciency [69] ranged from 94% to 103% ( n = 12). The 2 −∆∆Ct method determined relative
gene expression between treated and untreated FLSs, with GAPDH (SBH1220545) as the
endogenous reference gene.
4.8. Sampling of Human Synovial Fluid
Human SF was obtained from 18 OA patients during arthroscopy (early-stage OA) or
knee replacement surgery (late-stage OA) and prepared as described [1]. The Ethical Review
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine (Justus Liebig University of Giessen, Germany)
approved this study, and all patients provided written informed consent to donate samples
for research. We used the Outerbridge classification scale (OU) to subcategorize changes in
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 8363 13 of 17
the joints during OA as early (eOA) and late OA (lOA), as defined earlier [1,2]. Eight patients
with eOA (age 44.8± 13.1 years,BMI 27.4 ± 2.9 kg/m2, CRP 2.2 ± 2.1 mg/mL, 7 males) and
ten patients with lOA (age 64.7± 13.0 years,BMI 31.0 ± 5.9 kg/m2, CRP 1.76 ± 1.0 mg/mL,
7 males) were included. Some patients had comorbidities, including cardiac insufficiency
(lOA: n = 1), coronary heart disease (lOA: n = 1), hypertension (lOA: n = 9; eOA: n = 1),
cardiac arrhythmia (lOA: n = 1), angina pectoris (lOA: n = 2), gout (lOA: n = 2), diabetes
(eOA: n = 1), hay fever (lOA:n = 2; eOA: n = 1), and hypothyroidism (lOA:n = 2; eOA: n = 2).
SF was obtained as previously described [1]. Briefly, fresh SF samples were checked
for blood contamination and high turbidity, incubated for 15 min at 37◦C, and filtered to
remove cells. Samples were then analyzed microscopically, treated with 10% protease and
phospholipase inhibitors, centrifuged at 16,100× g for 45 min, and supernatant was frozen
at −86 ◦C for subsequent analysis.
4.9. MS Analysis of Sphingolipids in Knee Synovial Fluid of OA Patients
Sphingolipids were extracted and quantified as detailed earlier [70,71]. In brief, lipids
were extracted from the cell and cell debris-free supernatant of SF, and the concentrations
of SPC [71], C1P [71], and S1P [70] were determined by liquid chromatographic separation
MS/MS (LC-MS/MS). Lipid species were annotated as published [72].
4.10. Bioinformatics
We used Proteome Discoverer 2.5.0.400 to obtain protein annotations from the Gene
Ontology (GO) database (https://geneontology .org/, accessed 22 February 2024) as previously
described [9]. Briefly , for analyzing differentially expressed proteins, we retrieved information
on biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. GO Slim terms from
The Jackson Laboratory were modified with additional terms from the GO Enrichment Tool
in Proteome Discoverer to enrich the proteins with OA-relevant information.
4.11. Statistical Analysis
The data analysis and charts were generated using GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 for
Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and Proteome Discoverer version
2.5.0.400 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Venn diagrams were drawn using
a web-based tool [73]. The proteins used for the proteomic analysis were sourced from
cell extracts of both treated and untreated FLS cultures, all from the same patient. The
experiments were repeated 6 times, using samples from 7 OA patients; thus, 7 biological
replicates per treatment were analyzed, with each replicate being assessed in duplicate
(n = 7). In total, proteomic data were collected from 14 replicates for each treated or
untreated FLS culture.
To address skewness, both the abundance and abundance ratios (ARs) were log-
transformed before including them in the analysis. The subsequent analysis adhered to the
following 3 prerequisites: (1) ARs of proteins that were reproducibly regulated by C1P , S1P ,
SPC, IL-1ß, or IL-1ß in the presence of C1P , S1P , or SPC are above 1.2-fold or below 0.8-fold
relative to untreated controls in at least 11 of 14 replicates. (2) On average, ARs of proteins
from treated FLSs had to be over 1.2-fold or below 0.8-fold relative to untreated controls.
(3) ARs of proteins from FLSs treated with C1P , S1P , or SPC in the presence of IL-1ß had to
be above 1.2-fold or below 0.8-fold relative to FLSs that were administered IL-1ß alone in at
least 11 of 14 replicates.
The adjusted p-values for comparing the levels between treated and untreated con-
trols (Table S1) were calculated using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA, followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Adjusted p-values for comparing 2 ARs (Table S2)
were determined through multiple paired t-tests, with p-values corrected for multiple
comparisons using the Holm–Sidak method.
ARs are reported as mean ± SD, and those present in at least 11 of the 14 consistently
regulated replicates are highlighted in bold (Tables S1 and S2). The significance threshold
was set at p ≤ 0.05. Additionally, a Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to assess
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 8363 14 of 17
the relationship between the mean AR of selected proteins and the mean fold-change in
their respective mRNA levels.
