Purification of valuable engineered proteins and enzymes can be laborious, costly, and generating 
large amount of chemical waste. Whilst enzyme immobilization can enhance recycling and reuse of 
enzymes, conventional methods for immobilizing engineered enzymes from purified samples are 
also inefficient with multiple‑step protocols, regarding both the carrier preparation and enzyme 
binding. Nickel ferrite magnetic nanoparticles  (NiFe2O4 MNPs) offer distinct advantages in both 
purification and immobilization of enzymes. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of 
 NiFe2O4 MNPs via a one‑step solvothermal synthesis and their use in direct enzyme binding from 
cell lysates. These  NiFe2O4 MNPs have showed an average diameter of 8.9 ± 1.7 nm from TEM 
analysis and a magnetization at saturation  (Ms) value of 53.0 emu  g–1 from SQUID measurement. 
The nickel binding sites of the MNP surface allow direct binding of three his‑tagged enzymes, 
d‑phenylglycine aminotransferase (d ‑PhgAT), Halomonas elongata ω‑transaminase (HeωT), and 
glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsGDH). It was found that the enzymatic activities 
of all immobilized samples directly prepared from cell lysates were comparable to those prepared 
from the conventional immobilization method using purified enzymes. Remarkably, d‑PhgAT 
supported on  NiFe2O4 MNPs also showed similar activity to the purified free enzyme. By comparing 
on both carrier preparation and enzyme immobilization protocols, use of  NiFe2O4 MNPs for direct 
enzyme immobilization from cell lysate can significantly reduce the number of steps, time, and use 
of chemicals. Therefore,  NiFe2O4 MNPs can offer considerable advantages for use in both enzyme 
immobilization and protein purification in pharmaceutical and other chemical industries.
Protein purification is often employed to isolate a single type of protein from a complex biomolecular mixture, e.g. 
from animal or plant tissues, or from cell  lysate1–4. However, it can involve many separation techniques and steps 
to attain the desired  protein5,6. As a result, a substantial amount of time and chemicals/materials (e.g. surfactants) 
are consumed in order to successfully purify the required protein from the starting  material5,7 significantly 
increasing the operational  cost6. Indeed, the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sectors are considered to be 
less environmentally friendly (measured with “E-factor”) than petroleum industries regarding waste  emissions8. 
Under the current climate regarding sustainability, these sectors need to reduce their waste emissions but retain 
productivity. Simplifying the purification protocols of biomolecules, including proteins and enzymes, would 
help to reduce waste emissions significantly.
In order to facilitate a reduction in steps and chemical usage for protein purification, a histidine peptide chain, 
or “his-tag” , was added to the recombinant protein expressions via genetic  engineering9–12. His-tagged proteins 
and enzymes can be purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), which exploits the 
strong co-ordinate bonds formed the his-tag and the transition metal ions in the support (or stationary phase), 
using Ni columns to trap the desired  protein13–16. Nickel, notably Ni–NTA  (Ni2+ ions coupled to nitrilotriacetic

acid), has become the most commonly used metal ion species in IMAC due to its high binding affinity to his-tag 
at pH 8 or  higher9,17. Eluting for the bound his-tagged proteins can be carried out by reducing the pH or using 
competitive, strong chelating agents such as EDTA or imidazole, which would compete with the his-tags for the 
Ni  sites18–21. In general, adding a his-tag on to a protein can simplify the purification and allow for a high purity 
 sample22. Exploiting such use of his-tag chelation to metal ions can enhance purification and immobilization of 
proteins in one step onto a carrier with accessible nickel sites.
Scientists have also been exploiting the binding property of his-tags to nickel for enzyme  immobilization23–27. 
For example, Zhou et al. reported the use of a non-magnetic carrier, Ni–NTA on mesoporous silica nanoparti-
cles, to immobilize his-tagged organophosphohydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OpdA) for the 
bioremediation of organophosphates in  soil28. Although this Ni-loaded carrier allowed an in tandem purification 
and immobilization of enzymes directly from the cell lysate, the synthesis of carrier was rather complicated with 
a protocol of at least five steps, including the synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles and grafting Ni–NTA, 
which may not enhance sustainability and cost  effectiveness29. Magnetic supports with Ni binding sites can add 
further advantages in separation if the matrices contain considerable amount of unwanted solid such as debris 
from cell cultures. In the literature, one-pot purification and immobilization of enzymes has also been reported 
using magnetic materials functionalized with Ni–NTA functional  groups30,31. For example, Wang et al. synthe-
sized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) coated  Fe3O4 MNPs with Ni–NTA as the nickel source for chelate 
a his-tagged enzyme epoxide hydrolase directly from a cell  lysate30. However, the synthesis of these particles 
involves at least six steps from the preparation of oleic acid coated  Fe3O4 MNPs to the Ni–NTA functionalized 
particles. Despite improvement on particle size (down to ca. 70 nm), the overall magnetization was rather low, 
at < 1.5 emu/g (compared to a typical value of 40–90 emu/g for magnetic nanoparticles), due to non-magnetic 
PGMA component. To simplify the material synthesis, preparation of  NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in a two-step pro-
cedure was reported for immobilizing glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) directly from a cell  lysate31. Unfortunately, 
this study lacks characterization data on the material for identifying the nature of the magnetic support being 
used. Other examples of magnetic carriers for enzyme immobilization can also be found in the  literature32,33. 
Commercial magnetic carriers functionalized with Ni binding sites are also available for this  purpose34–36 but 
they tend to be larger in particle size (250 nm–30 μm), which may reduce the binding capacity per mass of carrier.
In this work, we prepared  NiFe2O4 MNPs via a one-step solvothermal synthesis and the nanoparticles were 
fully characterized using XRD, TEM, and VSM magnetometry. These MNPs were used for a one-pot purifica-
tion and immobilization of his-tagged enzymes directly from cell lysates, with a simple protocol illustrated in 
Fig. 1. Firstly, GFP was used as a model protein to validate that immobilization via his-tag on  NiFe2O4 MNPs 
occurred. Three enzymes, d -phenylglycine aminotransferase (d-PhgAT), Halomonas elongata ω-transaminase 
(HeωT), and Bacillus subtilis glucose dehydrogenase (BsGDH), were then used as model enzyme molecules and 
their activity as the immobilized form was comparable to the immobilized enzymes prepared via a conventional 
two-step protocol (purification followed by immobilization). This is the first report presenting a protocol for 
direct enzyme immobilization from cell lysates using  NiFe2O4 MNPs with no surface functionalization. This 
protocol significantly simplified the conventional enzyme immobilization procedure from purified enzymes. 
Moreover, the preparation procedure of the  NiFe2O4 used is also considerably simpler than other surface func-
tionalized magnetic nanoparticles, notably Ni–NTA functionalized  Fe3O4 MNPs, which is commonly used for 
enzyme immobilization.

Preparation of nickel ferrite  NiFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles MNPs
Nickel ferrite magnetic nanoparticles  (NiFe2O4 MNPs) was prepared using via solvothermal  synthesis37. Nickel 
chloride hexahydrate (2.38 g) and iron chloride hexahydrate (5.41 g) were dissolved in 20 mL of ethylene glycol. 
A separate solution was prepared by dissolving urea (2.5 g) and polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP (0.2 g) with another 
20 mL portion of ethylene glycol. These solutions were then fully mixed at room temperature until a homog-
enized solution was achieved. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave (Parr 
acid digestion vessel, 45 mL) and heated in an oven to 180 °C for 20 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room 
temperature and the black  NiFe2O4 MNPs were harvested with a magnet, and washed with distilled water for at 
least 20 times followed by ethanol a further 10 times. The  NiFe2O4 MNPs were then dried at 60 °C under vacuum 
in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Characterization of  NiFe2O4 MNPs
The as prepared  NiFe2O4 MNPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy TEM, SQUID (super-
conducting quantum interference device) magnetometry and powder x-ray diffraction XRD. The morphology 
of the  NiFe2O4 MNPs was examined using a FEI TECNAI TF20 microscope fitted with a field emission gun and 
operated at 200 keV . The  NiFe2O4 MNPs sample (< 0.1 mg) was suspended in ethanol using sonication and then 
deposited on a holey carbon (300 mesh) sample grid (Agar). The prepared sample grid was dried in air for at 
least 24 h before analysis. To study the magnetic properties of the  NiFe2O4 MNPs, measurements of hysteresis 
loops were performed on a Quantum Design MPMS3 SQUID magnetometer equipped with a 7 T DC magnet. 
In a typical experiment, a sample was weighed into a gel capsule. A small drop of Eicosene (Sigma-Aldrich) 
preheated to 60 °C was added to the capsule to prevent the sample from moving within strong magnetic fields. 
The capsule then was weighed again to account for the mass of Eicosene. The hysteresis loops of the magnetic 
moment (M) versus field (H) for the samples were measured at room temperature with a maximum field of 
about ± 15 kOe. The crystal structure of  NiFe2O4 MNPs was examined using a Panalytical diffractometer (Cu 
Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 nm) for 2θ from 20°–80° at a scan rate of 2° per minute used to analyze the crystalline 
structure of the prepared  NiFe2O4 sample.
GFP binding 
To visualize the protein binding to  NiFe2O4 MNPs surface, his-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used 
as the test protein molecule.  NiFe2O4 MNPs (10 mg) were fully dispersed in 10 mL of 50 mM potassium phos -
phate buffer (pH 8) through sonication, then GFP at 0.025 μg/mL was added to the MNP suspension and left to 
interact for 4 h at 4 °C. To keep the fluorescence active, the suspension was wrapped in tin foil and kept in the 
dark for the duration of binding. After binding the supernatant was removed, the particles were washed until the 
supernatant appeared to show no fluorescence under a UV light. The GFP tagged MNPs (MNP-GFP) were then 
redispersed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) ready for fluorescence quantification. Fluorescence 
imaging was carried out using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss AXIO Imager M2) under a × 10 magnification and 
blue light at 488 nm. The images from the sample were recorded using Zeiss AxioCam ERc 5 s in both brightfield 
mode and fluorescence mode.
Protein expression and enzyme purification
All enzymes were prepared from recombinant protein (enzyme) expression in E coli.  Bacteria38,39. In general, E. 
coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed via heat shock transformation with the desired plasmid. Selection was 
carried out on lysogeny broth (LB) agar supplemented with antibiotics. A starter culture of LB media was inocu-
lated with a single colony. Starter culture was used to inoculate fresh LB media which was grown then induced 
using iso-propyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested from the cultures expressing the 
protein before storing as a pellet at − 20 °C.
Cell pellets were re-suspended and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed and the remaining cell lysate 
was then filtered. The his-tagged enzymes were purified using IMAC using a HisTrap™ Nickel affinity column 
(Cytiva Lifesciences, UK), followed by SEC. In short, the binding and separation mechanism of his-tagged 
enzymes is based on the interaction between the his-tags and the Ni binding site on the stationary phase of the 
HisTrap™ column. Protein yield and concentration were determined and the purified protein was flash frozen 
and stored at − 80 °C. (See Sects. S1.1 and S1.2 in Supplementary Information for additional details on protein 
expression and purification.)

Direct immobilization of d‑PhgAT and HeωT from cell lysate 
In a typical experiment, 10 mg of  NiFe2O4 MNPs are dispersed in 9 mL potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, 
pH 8) with DMSO (0.25% v/v) and PLP (0.1 mM), and are sonicated for 15 min to ensure full dispersion of 
nanoparticles. Then 1 mL of cell lysate is added to the  NiFe2O4 MNPs solution and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. After 
immobilization the supernatant was removed, and the immobilized particles were washed with 5 portions of 
buffer (5 mL) to remove the undesirable components from the cell lysate. The immobilized enzyme on MNPs 
were then redispersed in 10 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ready for reactions. These samples were 
denoted as MNP-d-PhgAT CL and MNP-HeωT CL, where “CL ” indicates the immobilization was carried out 
directly from cell lysates. For each transaminase a further two purifications and immobilizations were carried 
out to also further asses if the nanoparticle concentration influenced the activity.
Activity assay for d‑PhgAT and HeωT 
The activity of both transaminases (d-PhgAT and HeωT) was determined by the rate of acetophenone production 
(at 245 nm) per minute by UV spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer, UVmini-1240). A typical 
reaction would take place at 37 °C and include a reaction mixture containing d -PhgAT or HeωT (0.018 mg/
mL or 0.05 mg/mL respectively), sodium pyruvate (2.5 mM), (s)-methylbenzylamine (2.5 mM), PLP (0.1 mM) 
in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH8) and DMSO (0.25%v/v) in a final reaction volume of 1   mL40,41. 
Each assay was repeated at least three times and the specific activity was expressed as M/mg of purified enzyme.
Purification and direct immobilization of BsGDH from cell lysate
The glucose dehydrogenase purification and immobilization from cell lysate was carried out using a similar 
protocol as immobilizing d-PhgAT and HeωT. In this immobilization, 10 mg of  NiFe2O4 MNPs was dispersed 
fully in in 9 mL of potassium phosphate buffer via sonication. Then 1 mL of cell lysate was added to the reaction 
mixture and placed on an orbital mixer for 4 h at 4 °C. Once the purification/immobilization was complete, the 
supernatant was removed and the immobilized GDH particles (MNP-GDH CL) were washed with 5 volumes of 
2 mL of buffer to remove any undesired components from the cell lysate. The immobilized enzymes were then 
redispersed in 10 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) ready to be used for assays. The volume of 
MNP-GDH CL was kept the same as the purified BsGDH immobilization to be able to make a direct comparison 
to the purified enzyme.
Activity assay for glucose dehydrogenase 
The activity of BsGDH from Bacillus subtilis (0.041 mg/mL) was assessed at 580 nm using glucose (6 mM) and 
 NADP+ (0.004 mM) as substrates, nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) (0.2 mg/mL) and phenazine metho-
sulfate (PMS) (0.01 mg/mL) were added to the assay as they react with the NADPH produced by the GDH to 
produce an insoluble blue-purple formazan which can be measured at 580  nm42. The reaction was monitored in 
a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer (UVmini-1240).
Results
Characterizations of  NiFe2O4 MNPs
The prepared  NiFe2O4 MNPs were characterized with TEM, VSM and XRD. The identity of the samples was 
confirmed to be  NiFe2O4 by XRD (Fig. 2a) as the diffraction pattern was indexed and matched well with JCPDS 
card 74-2081. Using Scherrer analysis on the peaks, the size of the crystallites was found to be 10.6 ± 2.8 nm. The 
morphology of the  NiFe2O4 sample was studied using TEM as shown in Fig. 2c, where a pseudo-spherical mor-
phology is observed. The particle size of the  NiFe2O4 sample was also analysed using ImageJ on 120 particles and 
the size distribution was shown in Fig. 2d. The average particle size was 8.9 ± 1.7 nm with the majority of particles 
(ca. 90%) were within the range of 6–11 nm. This result is consistent with the crystallite size estimated using 
Scherrer analysis, suggesting that most of these nanoparticles are of single domains. The magnetic property of the 
 NiFe2O4 sample was analysed using SQUID magnetometry. Figure 2b shows the M v H curve with no hysteresis 
loop, suggesting that the sample is of superparamagnetic nature. This is common for magnetic nanoparticles of 
size smaller than 30 nm. The sample has shown a magnetization at saturation (Ms) value 53.0 emu  g–1 at H = 15 
kOe, the value is comparable to those reported in the  literature37,42–44. The FTIR spectrum of  NiFe2O4 shown in 
Fig. 2e. The characteristic peak at 576   cm–1 was attributed to the Fe–O bond which is sometimes described as 
evidence of the formation of cubic spinel nickel ferrite structure. Other peaks that are present would be from 
the urea and PVP reactants. Characteristic peaks for urea at 1650 and 1039  cm–1 for C=O and C–N respectively, 
while PVP peaks appear at 1398  cm–1 for the aromatic amine (C-N) bond, and 1757  cm–1 for the C=O bond.
Binding of his‑tagged GFP
In order to study binding his-tagged proteins with visual effect, his-tagged GFP was used. GFP is widely used 
as a probe for validating biological experiments using fluorescence microscopy, providing visual  evidence45. In 
Fig. 3a and b, it can be seen that the  NiFe2O4 MNP aggregates fluoresced under a blue light. This suggested that 
the his-tagged GFP has bound onto the  NiFe2O4 MNPs directly.
One‑pot purification and immobilization for enzymes
The goal of this study is to develop a fast, direct route to immobilize enzyme via his-tag binding. We have cho -
sen three his-tagged enzymes for validating this method, d -PhgAT, HeωT and BsGDH. The activities of these 
enzymes were compared in three different forms: free enzymes, immobilized enzymes from pre-purified form 
(the conventional route), and immobilized enzymes directly from cell lysates. Assay for both d-PhgAT and HeωT

transaminases used the transamination reaction from s-methylbenzylamine to form glutamic acid, while the 
production of acetophenone was measured (Fig. 4a). For BsGDH activity, an indirect method was adapted. The 
production of formazan was measured, following the scheme in Fig. 4b.
The initial activities (initial rates of reaction) and the activity curves of all three enzymes were shown in 
Table 1 and Fig. 5 respectively. In all three cases, initial activities of immobilized enzymes from the two meth-
ods (conventional route from pre-purified enzymes and direct immobilization from cell lysates) showed little 
difference, as shown in Table 1. This suggests that  NiFe2O4 MNPs can be used as the carrier for direct enzyme 
immobilization from cell lysates without compromising on the enzyme activity. In case of d-PhgAT, both immo-
bilized enzymes also showed an improvement on activity compared with the free enzyme. This was not the case 
in HeωT and BsGDH where loss of activity was observable, which is commonly found in many immobilized 
enzyme systems. However, when comparing the activities among the immobilized enzymes, all three samples

displayed little difference between two different immobilization methods, direct binding from cell lysates vs 
binding from pre-purified enzymes. This observation suggested that enzyme immobilization can be carried out 
without laborious pre-purification steps.
Moreover, this direct immobilization method can also be operated in a larger scale. An experiment was set 
up with the undiluted cell lysate with d -PhgAT at 24 mL with a much higher concentration of  NiFe2O4 MNPs 
(267 mg/mL, calculated based on the enzyme concentration in cell lysate). The initial activity of the immobilized 
enzyme was comparable to the smaller scale (1 mL) immobilization, as seen in Fig. S3. The recorded final conver-
sion was lower possibly due to the lower immobilization efficiency using a higher MNP concentration. None -
theless, this suggested that our system can possibly be scaled up, making it more suitable for use in industries.
Discussion
Protein purification and immobilization using his-tag technology is very useful as mentioned earlier. Using 
magnetic carriers has added an advantage of magnetic separation, which helps in recovering the desired products 
from a complex matrix, particularly where unwanted solid residues are in the matrix, including cell  lysates47. 
However, most magnetic carrier materials reported in the literature for binding his-tagged proteins require 
multi-step protocols for their synthesis (see Fig. 6). For example, Zhou et al. reported a 6-step protocol to prepare 
Ni–NTA MNPs, which allows direct binding to his-tagged species (Fig. 6a)28. For immobilizing non-his-tagged 
proteins, glutardialdehyde-functionalized MNPs are commonly used but they still need a 3-step protocol for 
synthesis (Fig. 6b)48. Using glutardialdehyde functional groups for protein purification/immobilization possess 
a non-selective binding. This is likely to cause problem from cell lysates where many different protein types are 
present. Since  NiFe2O4 MNPs have intrinsic Ni binding sites on surface, a one-step solvothermal synthesis can 
produce a ready-for-use carrier for binding his-tagged proteins (Fig. 6c). Generally, the more steps in synthesis, 
the protocol will incur a lower efficiency and a lower material yield, and also use more chemicals. Therefore, use 
of  NiFe2O4 MNPs can also be seen as a greener option for purification and immobilization of his-tagged species 
by reducing use of unnecessary chemicals and emission of wastes. Under the current climate, such advantage can 
be particularly attractive in reducing the environmental impacts from biotechnological industries.
In addition to simplified synthesis protocol, purification with direct immobilization of his-tagged enzymes 
from cell lysates also help to improve the efficiency in protein/enzyme purification, in particular if the end use 
is as immobilized enzymes. Figure 7 illustrates the steps required for the immobilization of a purified his-tagged 
enzyme from cell lysate in a conventional protocol, compared to a one-step direct immobilization demon-
strated in our work. The key feature highlighted here is that little loss in activity was shown from three different 
enzymes comparing to those from conventional immobilization using pre-purified enzymes, suggesting that

direct immobilization can also simplify the immobilization protocol. Again, similar to materials synthesis, the 
fewer steps required for immobilization also result in reducing use of unnecessary chemical and waste emission, 
making the method even greener.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated a solvothermal synthesis method for  NiFe2O4 MNPs. From the TEM analysis and VSM 
measurement, these  NiFe2O4 MNPs have an average diameter of 8.9 ± 1.7 nm and a magnetization at saturation 
of 59 emu  g–1. These MNPs were proven to bind his-tagged GFP as observed using fluorescent microscopy. 
For direct enzyme immobilization from cell lysates, all three enzymes (d -PhgAT, HeωT and BsGDH) showed 
activities (initial rates) comparable to the correspondent immobilized enzymes prepared via a conventional 
method (i.e. purification followed by immobilization). More interestingly, immobilized d -PhgAT samples, via 
either direct immobilization from cell lysate or conventional immobilization method, showed a higher activity 
than the purified free enzymes, at only 1.7 nmol   min–1 compared with 2.2 and 2.4 nmol   min–1 recorded from 
the immobilized samples.
Regarding synthesis of carriers, the one-step protocol for  NiFe2O4 MNPs is a significant advancement com-
pared to other magnetic nano-carriers with Ni sites, that could take as many as 6 steps to prepare. Since many 
engineered enzymes were modified to tether a polyhistidine chain for purification purpose, direct binding using 
this functionality onto a nickel-based carrier would save the use of binding agents (e.g. EDC/NHS) that may also 
alter the chemical structure of enzymes due to crosslinking. Exploiting the Ni-histidine affinity also offers a high 
selectivity/specificity for the desired proteins. Using direct immobilization method from cell lysates also reduce 
time, manpower and chemicals during purification of enzymes. Therefore, this simple, direct immobilization of 
enzymes using  NiFe2O4 MNPs can enhanced the sustainability of relevant pharmaceutical and chemical indus-
tries. Furthermore, enzymatic reactions can be considered to be greener due to their low-energy requirement 
and solvent-free nature. Reuse and recycling of enzymes using magnetic separation can make many enzymatic 
reactions feasible for large-scale applications in industries by reducing cost and environmental impact.
