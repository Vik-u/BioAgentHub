NADP-MEs are divided into photosynthetic and non-
photosynthetic subtypes by their physiological function 
(Drincovich et al. 2001). The photosynthetic NADP-MEs 
involve in carbon fixation for delivering CO 2 to Rubisco 
in the bundle sheath chloroplasts of C4 plants and in the 
cytosol of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants 
(Alvarez et al. 2019). While the non-photosynthetic 
NADP-MEs are generally presented in cytosol or plastid 
for all C3, C4 and CAM plants. They have been demon -
strated to participate in multiple biological processes, 
including fruit ripening (Edwards and Andreo 1992), 
cytosolic pH regulation (Edwards and Andreo 1992), 
stomatal regulation (Laporte et al. 2002), lipogenesis 
(Shearer et al. 2004), seed germination ability (Arias et al.

Abstract
Plants NADP-malic enzymes (NADP-MEs) act as a class of oxidative decarboxylase to mediate malic acid 
metabolism in organisms. Despite NADP-MEs have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in regulating diverse 
biological processes, the role of NADP-MEs involving in plant growth and development remains rarely known. 
Here, we characterized the function of rice cytosolic OsNADP-ME2 in regulating plant height. The results showed 
that RNAi silencing and knock-out of OsNADP-ME2 in rice results in a dwarf plant structure, associating with 
significant expression inhibition of genes involving in phytohormone Gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and signaling 
transduction, but with up-regulation for the expression of GA signaling suppressor SLR1. The accumulation of major 
bioactive GA1, GA4 and GA 7 are evidently altered in RNAi lines, and exogenous GA treatment compromises the 
dwarf phenotype of OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines. RNAi silencing of OsNADP-ME2 also causes the reduction of NADP-
ME activity associating with decreased production of pyruvate. Thus, our data revealed a novel function of plant 
NADP-MEs in modulation of rice plant height through regulating bioactive GAs accumulation and GA signaling, 
and provided a valuable gene resource for rice plant architecture improvement.

Dangol et al. 2019).
Gibberellins (GAs) are essential phytohormones for 
multiple growth and developmental processes in control-
ling root and shoot elongation, seed germination, flow -
ering, fruit patterning and pollen maturation in plants 
(Yamaguchi 2008; Davière and Achard, 2013). A promi -
nent biological role of GA is to promote stem elonga -
tion and plant heightening. Mutations of those genes 
involving in GA biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal -
ing cascades could influence rice plant height (Davière 
and Achard, 2013). For example, the mutation of one key 
gene SD1, encoding an enzyme GA20ox-2 for GA syn -
thesis, resulted in a semi-dwarf phenotype in rice, which 
significantly improved rice yield and lodging resistance 
during the “Green Revolution” (Sasaki et al. 2002).
GA biosynthesis is originated from the catalyzation of 
precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) via iso -
pentenyl diphosphate (IPP) into geranylgeranyl diphos -
phate (GGDP), then GGDP is catalyzed to ent-kaurene by 
ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and ent-kaurene 
synthase (KS) in plastid. Following with an oxidization 
reaction catalyzed by kaurene oxidase (KO) and kaure -
noic acid oxidase (KAO), entkaurene is transformed 
to GA12 on ER membrane. Finally, GA 12 is catalyzed by 
GA3-oxidase (GA3ox) and GA20-oxidase (GA20ox) into 
gibberellin with higher biological activity in the cyto -
plasmic matrix (Yamaguchi 2008; Salazar-Cerezo et al. 
2018). Although hundreds of GAs are identified, only 
four GAs including GA 1, GA3, GA4 and GA7 are thought 
to be major bioactive hormones (Binenbaum et al. 2018). 
Among them, GA1 widely functions in various plant spe -
cies. GA 4 presents in most species, but is thought to be 
the major bioactive form in Arabidopsis and some Cucur-
bitaceae members (Yamaguchi 2008).
In rice, four NADP-ME genes present in the genome 
(Chi et al. 2004). Two of them OsNADP-ME2 (also 
known as OscytME1) and OsNADP-ME4 (also known as 
OscytME3) have been reported to enhance plant salt and 
osmotic stress when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis 
(Liu et al. 2007; Cheng and Long 2007). OsNADP-ME2 
was also found to be required for iron- and ROS-depen -
dent ferroptotic cell death and resistance against rice 
blast fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in rice (Singh 
et al. 2016; Dangol et al. 2019). However, whether rice 
OsNADP-MEs function in growth and development pro -
cesses remains unknown. Here, we characterized that 
rice cytoplasmic OsNADP-ME2 involves in regulation of 
plant height through affecting bioactive GAs accumula -
tion and GA signaling transduction, revealing a novel 
function of plant NADP-MEs in modulation of plant 
architecture.
Results
OsNADP-ME2 is a Constitutively Expressed Cytosolic 
NADP-malic Enzyme
Despite rice OsNADP-ME2 was classified into monocot-
specific cytosolic group (Chi et al. 2004; Wheeler et al. 
2005), its exact subcellular localization remains experi -
mentally inconclusive. To verify OsNADP-ME2 localiza -
tion, a construct with N-terminal GFP tag fused GFP: 
OsNADP-ME2 gene was expressed in rice protoplast, 
the fluorescence observation showed that the green fluo -
rescence only fills in the cytosol of rice protoplasts, but 
the control GFP fluorescence presents in the whole cells 
including cytosol and nucleus (Fig.  1A), confirming that 
the protein of OsNADP-ME2 indeed localized in cytosol

of rice cells. Further transcripts level analysis by real time 
RT-qPCR revealed that OsNADP-ME2 constitutively 
expressed in all rice tissues with the highest expression 
level in seedling leaf (Fig.  1B). These results indicated 
that OsNADP-ME2 possesses a constitutive expression 
pattern and is a cytosol localized protein in rice.
Knock-Down of OsNADP-ME2 Decreases Plant Height in 
Rice
To understand the biological function of OsNADP-ME2 
in rice, the OsNADP-ME2 RNAi silencing transgenic rice 
lines were constructed and used for phenotype evalua -
tion (Fig.  2A). The results showed that OsNADP-ME2 
RNAi lines 20 − 8 and 33 − 2, with a significant down-
regulation of transcripts, display an evidently dwarf phe -
notype comparing to wild type NPB plants at mature 
stage (Fig.  2). At mature stage, the total plant height of 
two RNAi lines was significantly decreased (Fig.  2B, 
C), and the reduced plant height was caused by the 
length decreasing of panicle and all the four internodes 
below the panicle (Fig.  2D, E). The dwarf phenotype was 
further confirmed that knock-out of OsNADP-ME2 by 
the CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene editing method in the 
background of another cultivar ZH11 also exhibited 
decreased plant height (Fig.  2F; Fig. S2). In osnadp-me2 
mutant, an 1 bp base deletion presented in the 10th exon 
of OsNADP-ME2 gene results in a frame shift with a pre -
mature termination of protein translation (Fig. S2). These 
results suggested that OsNADP-ME2 involves in rice 
plant height modulation.
Furthermore, the evaluation of phenotype for yield 
traits in OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines showed that the num-
ber of grains per panicle (Fig.  3A) and seed setting rate 
(Fig.  3B) were significantly lower than that in wild type 
NPB. A significant decreasing of 1000-grain weight was 
presented in RNAi lines (Fig.  3C), and only the signifi -
cant changes for an increasing of grain length on RNAi 
line 20 − 8 and a reduction of grain width for RNAi line 
30 − 3 were observed for grain size traits comparing to 
NPB (Fig.  3D, E). While the number of effective panicles 
per plant in RNAi lines was significantly larger than that 
of NPB (Fig.  3F). Consequently, there is no significant

difference for the yield of per plant between RNAi lines 
and NPB (Fig. 3G).
Knock-down of OsNADP-ME2 Alters the Expression Pattern 
of Genes in GA Biosynthesis and Signaling
The phytohormone GA is predominantly associated with 
plant height modulation (Yamaguchi 2008). To determine 
whether the GA pathway is affected in OsNADP-ME2 
RNAi lines, the transcription level for the genes involving 
in GA biosynthesis and signaling pathway was evaluated 
(Fig.  4). The results showed that the expression level of 
genes OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKAO, OsGA3ox1, OsGA3ox2, 
OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2, OsGA20ox3 and OsGA20ox4, 
of which these genes encode metabolic enzymes respon -
sible for GA biosynthesis (Yamaguchi 2008), were signifi-
cantly down-regulated in both two RNAi lines compared 
with that in wild type NPB (Fig. 4A, B).
Similarly, the expression level of OsGID1, OsGID2, 
OsPH1 and OsGRF1/2/8 genes positively regulating GA 
signaling (Wang and Wang et al., 2022) were also sig -
nificantly down-regulated in RNAi lines (Fig.  4C, D). 
However, the transcription level of SLR1, the central 
suppressors of GA signaling pathway (Ikeda et al. 2001), 
was remarkably up-regulated in RNAi lines (Fig.  4C). 
These results indicated that OsNADP-ME2 might involve 
in regulation of GA biosynthesis and signaling to affect 
plant height in rice.
Knock-down of OsNADP-ME2 Affects Endogenous 
Bioactive GAs Accumulation
The down-regulated expression of GA biosynthesis genes 
implicated that GA biosynthesis might be affected. To 
verify this speculation, the contents of three major bio -
active GAs (GA 1, GA 4 and GA 7) (Yamaguchi 2008) in 
RNAi line 33 − 3 in the leaf tissues for one week old seed -
ling was firstly measured (Fig.  4E), the results showed 
that the content of GA1, GA4 and GA7 in RNAi line 33 − 3 
was down-regulated comparing to NPB, although there 
is no statistical significance for decreased GA 4 content 
(Fig. 4E, S3). To further confirm that the level of bioac -
tive GAs at late stage of RNAi lines, the quantification 
of three GAs in the leaf tissues at two months old rice 
plants revealed that the content of GA1 and GA4 was also 
decreased in both RNAi lines 20 − 8 and 33 − 3 compar-
ing to the wild type NPB (Fig.  4F, S4). To be different, the 
content of GA 7 was increased in the leaf tissues at two 
months old rice plants (Fig. 4F, S4), that is opposite to the 
content in the leaf tissues of one week old seedling plants. 
The similar content pattern for three GAs at two month 
stage was also observed in osnadp-me2 gene editing

mutant in another genetic background of ZH11(Fig.  4G, 
S5). Thus, of these results indicated that OsNADP-ME2 
alters endogenous bioactive GAs accumulation pattern in 
rice.
Exogenous GA Treatment Eliminates the Inhibition of Plant 
Height in OsNADP-ME2 RNAi Lines
Because the bioactive GAs level was evidently changed 
in OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines (Fig.  4), we reasoned that 
whether the dwarf phenotype of OsNADP-ME2 RNAi 
lines is caused by GA deficiency. To verify this hypoth -
esis, the seeds of RNAi lines and NPB were germinated 
with a treatment of 100 µM exogenous GA 3 (Fig.  5). The 
results revealed that, after one week treatment, the shoot 
length of RNAi lines was obviously elongated with GA 
treatment compared to that in RNAi lines without GA 
treatment (Fig.  5A), so that there was no significant dif -
ference for the elongated shoot length between RNAi 
lines and NPB (Fig.  5B), indicating that exogenous GA 
treatment rescued the dwarf phenotype of OsNADP-
ME2 RNAi lines.
Knock-down of OsNADP-ME2 Reduces the NADP-ME 
Activity and Pyruvate Production
The major role of NADP-ME is to mediate oxidative 
decarboxylation for catalyzing malate to generate pyru -
vate, CO 2, and NADPH, thus, the NADP-ME enzyme 
activity was checked in both two OsNADP-ME2 RNAi 
lines. The results showed that the NADP-ME activity 
in the root, sheath, and leaf tissues for two RNAi lines 
were significantly lower than that in wild type (Fig.  6A). 
However, the malate content was increased in RNAi lines 
(Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the content of the reaction prod -
uct pyruvate was obviously decreased in the root, sheath, 
and leaf tissues of RNAi lines (Fig. 6C). These results sug-
gested that RNAi silencing of OsNADP-ME2 decreases 
the NADP-ME activity resulting in the reduction of oxi -
dative decarboxylation for malate to generate pyruvate.
Discussion
Despite the rice genome only includes four OsNADP-
ME genes, the biological function for these NADP-
MEs remains rarely known. Only OsNADP-ME2 is 
confirmed to involve in the disease resistance regula -
tion for rice blast (Singh et al. 2016; Dangol et al. 2019). 
In addition, the ectopic expression of OsNADP-ME2

and OsNADP-ME4 in Arabidopsis enhanced plant salt 
and osmic tolerance (Liu et al. 2007; Cheng and Long 
2007), but it is still valuable to confirm the function in 
rice. Here, we found that rice OsNADP-ME2 positively 
regulates plant height, because knock-down by RNAi 
silencing and knock-out via CRISPR/Cas9 editing of 
OsNADP-ME2 leads a dwarf phenotype (Fig.  2), suggest-
ing a novel function of OsNADP-ME2 in controlling rice 
plant structure. The previous phylogenetic analysis indi -
cated that OsNADP-ME2 is classified into the group of 
monocots cytosolic NADP-MEs (Chi et al. 2004), our 
current experimental results verified the cytosolic subcel-
lular localization of OsNADP -ME2 in rice cells (Fig.  1B). 
and a constitutive expression pattern for OsNADP-ME2 
was detected in various rice tissues (Fig.  1A), implicating 
a major role of OsNADP-ME2 in plant cytosolic biologi -
cal processes. It has been well known that plant NADP-
MEs participate in diverse physiological processes (Chen 
et al. 2019), but there was no report for NADP-MEs in 
controlling plant architecture, our data firstly provides 
evidence to support the novel function of NADP-MEs in 
regulating plant structure. However, whether other plant 
NADP-MEs share similar conserved function is of inter -
est to be investigated.
Plant height is a crucial trait of plant architecture for 
regulating crop yield performance and lodging resistance 
(Wang et al. 2017). Despite multiple phytohormones 
including GA, auxin, brassinosteroids (BRs), ethylene 
(ET), jasmonates (JAs), and strigolactones (SLs) con -
tribute to plant height controlling, GA is the most pre -
dominant regulator with significant roles in agricultural 
production (Wang and Wang et al., 2022). The semi-
dwarf architecture of high yielding crop varieties devel -
oped during the “Green Revolution” of 1960s is mainly 
caused by a significant improvement for GA biosynthesis 
and signaling pathway (Hedden 2003). Hence, extensive 
utilization of the sd1 genes and its alleles in rice breeding 
has resulted in potential threats of germplasm homog -
enization for crop production (Gaur et al. 2020). Thus, 
seeking new beneficial semi-dwarf germplasm or genes

for plant ideal height breeding is urgent for durable rice 
breeding. Here, our investigation revealed that OsNADP-
ME2 is a new gene conferring rice plant height control -
ling (Fig.  2). Both RNAi silencing and CRIPSR/Cas9 
gene editing of OsNADP-ME2 gene decreased rice plant 
height (Fig.  2), indicating that OsNADP-ME2 is a poten -
tial valuable gene for rice breeding application.
The expression level of those genes involving in GA 
biosynthesis were evidently altered in OsNADP-ME2 
RNAi lines (Fig.  4A, B), implying that OsNADP-ME2 
probably contributes to GA biosynthesis. This specula -
tion was confirmed that the content of bioactive GA 1, 
GA4 and GA 7 was found to be significantly changed in 
OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines (Fig.  4E and G), in which the 
content of GA1 and GA4 was reduced in both RNAi lines 
and gene-editing mutant at different growth stages, while 
the amount of GA 7 level was varied at different growth 
stages. In rice, it has been demonstrated that GA 1 is the 
major bioactive form in vegetative tissues of rice (Yama -
guchi 2008). Hao et al. showed that the content of GA 1 
is majority associated with rice plant height control -
ling (Hao et al. 2023). Here, our results confirmed that 
the decreased level of GA 1 is associated with rice dwarf 
phenotype of OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines and knock-out 
mutant, indicating that the decreased accumulation of 
GA1 by knock-down or -out of OsNADP-ME2 could be 
one of the causals for the dwarf phenoetype. Interest -
ingly, the decreased level of GA 4 is also correlated with 
OsNADP-ME2-mediated plant height in rice, however, 
GA4 is thought to involve in anther development (Itoh et 
al. 2001), whether GA4 is involved in plant height modu -
lation remains inconclusive. Additionally, the amount 
of GA7 is the highest one among three bioactive GAs in 
rice leaf tissues, but the content variation for GA 7 is not 
correlated with the phenotype changes for OsNADP-
ME2 RNAi lines, that could be partially explained by the 
reason that GA 7 is mainly involved rice anther develop -
ment (Kawai et al. 2022). However, why GA 7 possesses 
so much higher level in rice vegetative tissues remains 
to be elucidated. Furthermore, the dwarf phenotype of 
OsNADP-ME2 RNAi lines was recovered after treatment 
with exogenous GA (Fig.  5A, B). Thus, of these results 
suggested that OsNADP-ME2 is a novel regulator for 
plant height regulation by altering bioactive GAs accu -
mulation pattern.
The plants GA signaling is mainly promoted by GA-
GID1-DELLA complex stimulating ubiquitination pro -
tein degradation, of which the degradation of DELLA 
protein is mediated by the F-box protein SLY1/GID2 
associated SCF (SKP1, CULLIN, F-BOX) E3 ubiquitin-
ligase complexes. GID1 act as a GA receptor, the bound 
of GA to GID1 promotes the formation of GA-GID1-
DELLA complex, and DELLA is a key component for 
intracellular repressor of GA signaling. The degradation 
of DELLA releases the suppression of down-stream genes 
expression for GA response and growth and development 
regulation (Davière and Achard et al., 2013). Suppression 
of those genes in GA signaling results in a restrained phe-
notype of plant growth and development. In our results, 
consistent with the dwarf phenotype of OsNADP-ME2 
RNAi lines, the expression of genes involving in GA sig -
naling OsGID1, OsGID2, OsPH1, OsGRF1/2/4 was sig -
nificantly down-regulated in RNAi lines, that could be 
partially caused by the reduction of endogenous bioac -
tive GA 1 and GA 4 in RNAi lines (Fig.  4C, D). However, 
GA7 displays a higher-level accumulation in RNAi lines 
(Fig. 4F-G), of which GA7 has been shown to have a high-
est binding affinity with GA receptor GID1 (Kawai et al. 
2022). Thereby, that is inadequate to explain the suppres-
sion of GA signaling activation and dwarf phenotype for 
RNAi lines. Intriguingly, it is worthy to notice that the 
expression of GA signaling suppressor SLR1 (Ikeda et 
al. 2001) was predominantly up-regulated in RNAi lines 
(Fig.  4C), that could be one of reasons to explain that 
the effects of high level of GA 7 on GA signaling activa -
tion and plant internode elongation was suppressed by 
activated SLR1. Nevertheless, how SLR1 was activated in 
NADP-ME2 RNAi lines requires further investigation.
Although our data has demonstrated that OsNADP-
ME2 involves in the regulation of bioactive GAs accu -
mulation, how OsNADP-ME2 regulates bioactive GAs 
accumulation remains inconclusive. It is known that the 
role of NADP-MEs is to catalyzed malic acid into pyru -
vate, carbon dioxide and NADPH (Edwards and Andreo 
1992), the products of pyruvate and NADPH function in 
multiple metabolic pathways as a source of carbon and 
reductive coenzyme (Chen et al. 2019). In our results, 
RNAi silencing of OsNADP-ME2 decreased the activity 
of NADP-ME (Fig.  6A) resulting in a reduction of pyru -
vate (Fig.  6C), that is correlated with the decreased GA 
synthesis (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the NADP-ME cataly -
zation product pyruvate might involve in GA biosynthe -
sis. As we know, the GA biosynthesis is started from the 
catalyzation of GGPP into GGDP (geranylgeranyl diphos-
phate) (Yamaguchi 2008), while the GGPP is synthesized 
from the precursor IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate), of 
which IPP biosynthesis is synthesized through the DXP 
(1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate) pathway that requires 
pyruvate and GA-3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) as the 
original rection material (Schwender et al. 2001; Withers 
and Keasling et al., 2007). Thus, it is possible that the pro-
duction of pyruvate mediated by NADP-MEs is the cau -
sation for GA biosynthesis regulation through restraining 
the production of GGPP , but it is required for further 
investigation.
In conclusion, our results revealed that the rice 
OsNADP-ME2 functions as a novel regulator to modu -
late plant height involving in regulation of bioactive GAs

accumulation and GA signaling through unknown path -
way (Fig.  7), of which shed insights into understanding 
the novel function of plant NADP-MEs in plant height 
regulation, and also provided a new gene resource for 
rice plant architecture improvement.
Materials and Methods
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
The rice cultivar Nipponbare ( Oryza sativa L. ssp. japon-
ica) was used for the wild type (NPB) and transformation. 
For rice planting, seeds were husked and sterilized with 
70% ethanol for 2  min, then transferred to 10% NaClO 
solution for 15  min, after rinsed with sterilized ddH 2O 
for 3–5 times, the sterilized seeds were finally placed on 
1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar plates for germina -
tion. For GA3 treatment, 100µM GA3 was included in 1/2 
MS agar medium. After germination for 7 days, rice seed-
ling plants were transferred to soil pots and grown in the 
artificial climate chamber at 28  °C, 70% relative humid -
ity (RH), 12 h light for day time, followed at 22 °C, 70% 
RH, 12  h dark for night. In the field, rice seedling was 
transplanted into the field for growth season from May 
to September with normal managing measurements until 
mature.
Construct Making and Rice Transformation
The 210  bp sequence fragment of the 3’ region for 
OsNADP-ME2 was selected for RNAi construct making 
(Fig.S1), and cloned into the binary vector pANDA with 
the gateway cloning methods followed the procedure as 
described in Liu et al. ( 2015). The constructs were then 
transformed into cultivar Nipponbare with Agrobacte-
rium-mediated transformation method for generating 
RNAi transgenic plants.
Identification of CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing Mutant
One CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutant for OsNADP-
ME2 in the background of Japonica rice cultivar Zhon -
ghua11 (ZH11) was obtained from a rice CRIPSR/Cas9 
mutagenesis library (Lu et al. 2017). For mutant identi -
fication, one primer pairs crossing the sgRNA  A C A G C 
T T C C G T G G T C C T T T C site were designed and used 
for PCR amplification (Fig. S2). The PCR products were 
sequenced and alignment with the sequence from wild 
type ZH11 to confirm the mutant type.
Rice Protoplast Isolation and Plasmid Transfection
The procedure of rice protoplast isolation and plasmid 
transfection was followed by the description in He et al. 
(2018). A total of 5ug purified plasmid DNA was used 
for protoplasts transfection via PEG-mediated method. 
After incubation for approximate 12–20  h, the trans -
fected protoplasts were used for subcellular localization 
observation.
Subcellular Localization Analysis in Rice Protoplast
The rice protoplasts transfected with the plasmids con -
taining N terminal GFP fused GFP: OsNADP-ME2  gene 
and control GFP gene were used for fluorescent obser -
vation and photo-taking by a confocal microscope (Carl 
Zeiss LSM T-PMT 880) at excitation wavelength 488 nm 
and emission wavelength 509 nm.
RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR
Rice tissues were harvested for total RNA isolation with 
the Easy Step Super Total RNA Extraction Kit (Promega, 
Cat# LS1040). After DNA digestion with DNase I, 1  µg 
total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis with the Go 
Script™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Cat# 
A5001). 1  µl cDNA with dilution of 10 times was used 
for real-time quantitative PCR with ChamQ SYBR qPCR 
Master Mix (Vazyme, Cat#Q311-02). The PCR running 
program was 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 
15 s followed with 40 cycles. Two biological samples with 
three replications were performed. The relative expres -
sion level of target genes was calculated by the 2 −Δ∆Ct 
method using Ubiquitin gene as reference. The mean of 
three replications with Standard Deviation (SD) was used 
for final presented data. The primer pairs was listed in 
Table S1.
Phenotype Evaluation for Agronomy Traits
The rice plants including NPB, RNAi lines, CRISPR/
Cas9 editing line and ZH11 were harvested after mature 
Fig. 7 Proposed model of OsNADP-ME2-mediated plant height regula -
tion. The malic enzyme OsNADP-ME2 functions as a regulator of bioactive 
GAs accumulation in rice leaf tissues at vegetative stage possibly through 
regulating GA biosynthesis pathway or unknown pathway. In GA biosyn -
thesis pathway, the product of pyruvate catalyzed by OsNADP-ME2 from 
malate could be used as a precursor through DXP (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-
5-phosphate) pathway to synthesis GGPP , then GGPP is used as an original 
material to synthesis bioactive GAs (GA 1, GA4, GA7), and GAs further acti -
vate GA signaling to modulate plant height

for measuring the major agronomy traits of plant height, 
effective panicles, panicle length, grains per panicle, seed 
setting rate and thousand-grain weight. The rice seedling 
plants after treated with (or without) GA3 for 7 days were 
used for evaluated the phenotype of plant height, leaf 
length, sheath length and root length. The means were 
used for final data with SD with a student’s t-test for sig -
nificance difference analysis.
Quantification Measurement of Endogenous Bioactive GAs
A total of 0.6 g grinded rice seedling tissues frozen in liq -
uid nitrogen with 10 mL acetonitrile solution and 10  µl 
internal standard solution with corresponding GA 1(1 µg/
mL), GA4 (1 µg/mL) and GA7 (1 µg/mL) was incubated at 
4℃ for overnight. After centrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min, 
the supernatant was taken and mixed with 20  mg C18 
packing (Octadecylsilyl), then centrifuge at 10,000  g for 
5  min, the supernatant was dried in nitrogen flow, and 
dissolved in 200ul methanol. After filter with 0.22  μm 
organic phase filter membrane, the filtered solution was 
used for HPLC-MS/MS detection using the instrument 
of PE QSight 420 triple quadrupole (PerkinElmer, USA) 
to quantify the content of bioactive GAs (GA 1, GA4 and 
GA7).
For the recovery rate calculation of GAs measurement, 
one blank control with 10 ng/mL internal standard GA 1, 
GA4 and GA 7 were used for the representative to evalu -
ate the recovery rate, the corresponding recovery rate for 
GA1, GA4 and GA7 was shown in Table S2.
For the liquid phase, the chromatographic condi -
tions were : the poroshell 120 SB-C18 reverse phase 
chromatographic column (2.1 × 150, 2.7  μm); column 
temperature: 30 ℃; mobile phase: A: B =(water/0.02% 
formic acid): (chromatographic methanol); flow velocity: 
0.3 ml/min; and gradient elution mode: 0–1 min, 95% A; 
1–9  min, 95 − 40% A; 9–11  min, 40 − 5% A; 11–13  min, 
5% A; 13–13.2  min, 5–95% A; 13.2–15  min, 95% A; 
injected sample solution: 10 µL. For mass spectrometry 
analysis, the major parameters were used as following: 
Ionization mode: ESI positive and negative ion switch -
ing mode; scan type: MRM; air curtain:15psi; spay volt -
age: +5500/-5000v; atomizing pressure: 65psi; auxiliary 
pressure:70psi; atomization temperature: 400℃.
The hormone content calculation was used the for -
mula: hormone content (ng/g fresh weight) = detection 
concentration (ng/mL) × volume coefficient (mL)/mass 
coefficient ( G), where volume coefficient is the solution 
volume used in the final dissolution for tested sample, 
mass coefficient is the mass of tested sample. Two bio -
logical replications for leaf tissues of one week old seed -
ling and three biological replications for leaf tissues of 
two months old plants were performed for each example. 
The results represent the means of two or three biological 
replications.
Pyruvate Content Detection and NADP-ME Activity Assay
The content of pyruvate and NADP-ME activity in rice 
plants was detected respectively using a pyruvate detec -
tion kit (ZC-S0399, ShangHai ZCi BiO) and NADP-ME 
detection kit (ZC-S0321, ShangHai ZCi BiO) as described 
procedure. Simply, 0.1 g grinded tissues with 1 ml pyru -
vate or NADP-ME extraction buffer was mixed and then 
stood for 30 min at room temperature (RT), after centri -
fuged at 10,000  g for 8  min at RT, take the supernatant 
for measurement. For pyruvate, the supernatant was 
tested at wave length 520  nm. The content of pyruvate 
was calculated with a standard curve built from the test 
of labeled sample concentration. For NADP-ME activ -
ity, the corresponding extraction supernatant were mea -
sured at wave length 340  nm after adding the reaction 
buffer, the value of preliminary and 1 min after reaction 
were used for calculating the NADP-ME activity. Two 
biological replications with three repeats were detected, 
the means of three repeats for one representative biologi-
cal replication were used for final data with SD, Student’s 
t-test was used for significance level analysis.
Measurement of Malate Content
The HPLC method was used for malate detection. Briefly, 
0.5  g grinded rice leaf tissues within 3 mL ddH 2O was 
sonicated for 30  min, after centrifuge at 12,000  g for 
5 min, the supernatant was transferred and filtered with 
0.22  μm aqueous phase filter membrane, and the fil -
tered solution was used for malic acid testing with HPLC 
method.
