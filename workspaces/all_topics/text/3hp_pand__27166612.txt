1    Introduction
The yeast S. cerevisiae is widely applied in industrial bio-
technology for production of fuels, chemicals, and pharma-
ceutical ingredients and it is also used for fundamental 
research as a eukaryotic model organism [1–3]. Genetic 
manipulation of S. cerevisiae is greatly facilitated by its 
efficient inherent homologous recombination (HR) machin-
ery for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair [4]. As a 
result, many genome engineering tools have been devel-

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an established industrial host for production of recombinant proteins, 
fuels and chemicals. To enable stable integration of multiple marker-free overexpression cassettes 
in the genome of S. cerevisiae, we have developed a vector toolkit EasyClone-MarkerFree. The 
integration of linearized expression cassettes into defined genomic loci is facilitated by CRISPR/
Cas9. Cas9 is recruited to the chromosomal location by specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) expressed 
from a set of gRNA helper vectors. Using our genome engineering vector suite, single and triple 
insertions are obtained with 90–100% and 60–70% targeting efficiency, respectively. We demon-
strate application of the vector toolkit by constructing a haploid laboratory strain (CEN.PK113-7D) 
and a diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) for production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid, where we 
tested three different acetyl-CoA supply strategies, requiring overexpression of three to six genes 
each. Among the tested strategies was a bacterial cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, 
which was integrated into the genome in a single transformation. The publicly available EasyClone-
MarkerFree vector suite allows for facile and highly standardized genome engineering, and should 
be of particular interest to researchers working on yeast chassis with limited markers available.

oped that take advantage of HR for targeted integration of 
heterologous DNA into the yeast genome [5, 6]. Chromo-
somal gene integration has several benefits over plasmid-
based approaches, such as increased strain stability, bet-
ter control of gene expression level and lower population 
heterogeneity [5]. However, though the HR machinery has 
a high fidelity, selection is still necessary to identify the 
colonies that have been successfully engineered. This has 
the fundamental drawback that selection markers need to 
be recycled if multiple genome edits are needed. Also, 
both dominant and auxotrophic markers have been report-
ed to have an effect on cell physiology [7, 8]. Moreover 
antibiotic-based selection markers are undesirable in 
industrial strains due to the risk of spreading drug resist-
ance. A way to improve homology-directed chromosomal 
integration of heterologous gene fragments is by using 
DNA endonucleases for targeted DSB as this has been 
shown to increase recombination events by approximate-
ly three orders of magnitude [9–12]. Recently, the Clus-
tered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats 
(CRISPR) Type II system from bacteria has been adopted 
for genetic engineering of yeast [13]. This system consists 
of two components: guide RNA (gRNA) and CRISPR-
associated endonuclease (Cas9). Upon expression in the 
cell, the gRNA/Cas9 complex is recruited to DNA by base-
pairing of the gRNA recognition sequence (typically 20 bp) 
and the complementary DNA stand, after which the Cas9 
introduces a DSB break. The target DNA sequence must 
be immediately followed by a protospacer adjacent motif 
(PAM) (i.e. NGG for Streptococcus pyogenes-derived 
Cas9); Cas9 makes a blunt cut three nucleotides upstream 
of the PAM site [14]. There have been many recently pub-
lished examples of CRISPR-Cas9-based tools for yeast 
genome engineering [15–21] that are reviewed in 
Jakoc ˇiu ˉ nas et al. [22]. The work presented here builds on 
the previously reported method EasyClone for single-step 
targeted integration of multiple expression cassettes [5, 6]. 
The EasyClone method allows targeted genomic integra-
tion of up to three vectors in a single transformation event 
using auxotrophic or dominant selection markers. These 
target sites are located in the intergenic regions and are 
interspaced by essential genes to ensure that the inte-
grated DNA fragments are not at risk of being removed by 
HR [23]. Moreover it has been confirmed that integration 
into these sites ensures a high-level of expression and 
does not interfere with cellular growth [23]. The selection 
markers can be removed via Cre-LoxP-mediated recombi-
nation, which requires one extra transformation with 
CreA-vector, cultivation to induce the CreA expression 
and finally screening of the resulting clones on selection 
plates to confirm the loss of the marker; the marker remov-
al procedure has a turnaround time of about five days. 
Once the selection markers are eliminated, the strain is 
ready for the next integration event or for other genetic 
modifications. Marker removal, as well as being time con-
suming, can also cause genome instability [24, 25]. 
Here we present the EasyClone-MarkerFree method, 
which takes advantage of CRISPR-Cas9 for introduction 
of double-strand DNA breaks in the defined integration 
sites, which causes very efficient integration of expres-
sion cassettes and thus bypasses the need for selection. 
The gRNA helper vectors, expressing gRNA molecules 
that recruit Cas9 to the particular chromosomal locations, 
can be easily removed from the strain by growth on non-
selective medium, after which the strain is ready for the 
next modification. This shortens the turnaround time to 
only one or two days. Additional advantages are: simpli-
fied experimental design for cloning, because the choice 
of selection markers does not need to be taken into con-
sideration; elimination of the effect of the selection mark-
ers on strain physiology; and moreover a possibility to 
iterate gene integrations with other edits guided by 
CRISPR/Cas9, e.g. gene deletions. The use of predefined 
and characterized chromosomal target sites dispenses 
with the need for the experimenter to identify suitable 
regions in which to integrate their genes of interest. Fur-
thermore, we demonstrate the utility of the method by 
engineering 3-hydroxypropionic acid producing strains 
with improved precursor supply strategies. 
2    Materials and methods
2.1    Strains
Two different strains of S. cerevisiae were used: the hap-
loid laboratory strain CEN.PK113-7D (MAT a URA3 HIS3 
LEU2 TRP1 MAL2-8 c SUC2; obtained from Peter Kötter, 
Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany), 
and the diploid industrial Ethanol Red strain (MAT a/α; 
obtained from Fermentis, A Lesaffre division). E. coli 
strain DH5α alpha was used to clone, propagate, and store 
the plasmids.
2.2    Construction of plasmids
The codon-optimized genes, encoding the pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex and lipoate-protein ligase from 
Enterococcus faecalis, were ordered from GenScript 
(sequences can be found in Supporting information, 
Table  S5). The genes encoding ATP-dependent citrate 
lyase and the mitochondrial citrate transport protein, 
were amplified from the genomic DNA of Yarrowia lipol-
ytica DSM-8218, obtained from the DSMZ collection 
(www.dsmz.de). All of the primers, biobricks and plas-
mids constructed and used in this study can be found in 
Supporting information, Tables S1–S3.
The EasyClone-MarkerFree vectors were created by 
amplifying the EasyClone 2.0 vectors [6] with primers that 
were designed to attach to either side of the selection 
markers, creating a fragment that no longer contained the 
marker. These fragments were then ligated to form the

marker-less vectors. Seven of the resulting vectors (named 
“Intermediate vectors” in Table S3) contained PAM sites 
in the integration regions, which were removed by site-
directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL Site-
Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) accord-
ing to the manufacturers’ protocol. 
gRNA cassettes targeting particular integration loci 
(chromosomal coordinates can be found in Supporting 
information, Table S4) were ordered as double-stranded 
gene blocks from IDT DNA. These cassettes were ampli-
fied using primers 10525(TJOS-62 [P1F]) and 10529(TJOS-
65 [P1R]) and USER-cloned into pCfB2926 (pTAJAK-71) 
[15] to give single gRNA helper vectors. For construction 
of triple gRNA helper vectors, three gRNA cassettes were 
amplified using three primer pairs (10525(TJOS-62 [P1F]) 
and 10530(TJOS-66 [P2R]) for the first, 10526(TJOS-63 
[P2F]) and 10531(TJOS-67 [P3R]) for the second, and 
10527(TJOS-64 [P3F]) and 10529(TJOS-65 [P1R]) for the 
third gRNA cassette) and cloned into pCfB2926 
(p-TAJAK-71) [15]. Single gRNA helper vectors for Etha-
nol Red were constructed by PCR amplification of the 
template plasmid pCfB3041 using primers indicated in 
Supporting information, Table S1 as described in [17]. All 
of the cloning steps for creating gRNA helper vectors and 
EasyClone-MarkerFree vectors were performed in E. coli. 
Correct cloning was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. 
For expression of the Cas9 gene we used an episomal 
vector pCfB2312 with CEN-ARS replicon and KanMX 
resistance marker [17].
The EasyClone-MarkerFree vectors for expression of 
fluorescent protein or 3HP pathway genes were cloned as 
described in [5, 26]. The vectors were linearized with NotI, 
the integration fragment (part of the expression vector 
without E. coli ori and Amp
R) was gel-purified and trans-
formed, along with a gRNA helper vector, into yeast car-
rying the Cas9 plasmid (pCfB2312) via the lithium acetate 
method [27]. After the heat shock the cells were recovered 
for two hours in YPD medium and then plated on YPD agar 
containing 200 mg/L G418 and 100 mg/L nourseothricin. 
For yeast transformations with a single vector we rou-
tinely use 500 ng of the linear integration fragment along 
with 500  ng of the relevant gRNA helper plasmid. For 
yeast transformations with three vectors we use 1 µg of 
linear integration fragments and 1  µg of triple gRNA 
helper plasmid. Correct integration of the vectors into the 
genome was verified by colony PCR using primers listed 
in Supporting information, Table S1. 
2.3    Media and growth conditions
The E. coli strains containing the plasmids were grown in 
Luria–Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 100 µg/mL 
ampicillin. Yeast strains were grown in liquid YPD media, 
or on YPD agar plates with 20 g/L glucose (Sigma-
Aldrich). When needed the medium was supplemented 
with antibiotics G418 (200 mg/L) for the selection of the 
Cas9 plasmid, and/or nourseothricin (100 mg/L) for selec-
tion of the gRNA plasmid. Synthetic complete medium 
with 20 g/L glucose was prepared using drop-out powder 
from Sigma-Aldrich.
The strains were screened for production of 3HP as 
following. Single colonies were grown in 500 µL synthetic 
complete media in 96 deep-well plates with air-penetra-
ble lids (EnzyScreen, Germany) at 30°C with 250  rpm 
shaking overnight. The overnight cultures were then 
inoculated into 50 mL of either mineral media (MM) with 
60 g/L glucose [5], or a simulated fed-batch media (feed-
in-time, FIT) in 500 mL-shake flasks with baffles to a start-
ing OD
600 of 0.1. The feed-in-time (FIT) medium M-Sc.
syn-1000 synthetic FIT was purchased from M2P labs 
GmbH (Germany). All the media for 3HP cultivations were 
supplemented with 500 ng/mL of DL-α-lipoic acid (Sigma 
Aldrich). The strains were cultivated in MM or FIT media 
at 30°C with 250 rpm for 168 h. Samples were taken every 
12 h (every 1–2 h during the exponential phase in MM), 
with the optical density OD
600 being measured on a 
20-fold diluted culture broth. Samples were then centri-
fuged at 3000  ×g for 30  min and the supernatant was 
stored at -20°C until HPLC analysis. Cultivations were 
carried out in triplicate.
2.4    Analytical procedures
Strains expressing gfp were analyzed using a BioTek Syn-
ergy MX microplate reader. Excitation wavelength was 
set at 485 nm, and emission was read at 530 nm. Optical 
density was measured at 600  nm. Concentration of 
3-hydroxypropionic acid in the broth was measured by 
HPLC, using a method previously reported in [28]. 
2.5    Integration Stability
Strains that had been transformed with gfp-containing 
vectors were grown in 500  µL of YPD in 96 deep-well 
plates with air-penetrable lids at 30°C with 250 rpm shak-
ing overnight. The following morning, 50 µL of each cul-
ture was passed to 500 µL of fresh YPD. This was repeated 
for a total of five passages. At the end of the passages, the 
culture was plated onto YPD agar, and the fluorescent 
colonies were counted.
2.6    Determination of gene copy number by qPCR
Quantitative PCR was performed on the Ethanol Red 
strain containing the genes from Enterococcus faecalis. 
Primers were designed using the PrimerQuest ® tool 
 (https://eu.idtdna.com/Primerquest/Home/Index). Details 
of the primers used can be found in Supporting informa-
tion, Table S1. Genomic DNA was prepared using the ZR 
Fungal/Bacterial DNA MiniPrep™ kit (Zymo Research) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each reaction 
contained 10 µL of 2xSYBR Green qPCR MasterMix (Life

Technologies), 1 µL of each primer, 0.1 µL of diluted refer-
ence dye, and 7.7 µL of genomic DNA. Reactions were 
carried out in triplicate, with 5  pg of gDNA present in 
each reaction. ALG9 was used as a control, as well as a no 
template control where the gDNA was replaced with 
nuclease-free PCR grade water. The experiment was car-
ried out using a Stratagene Mx3005P qPCR system with 
the following settings; 10  min pre-incubation at 95°C, 
40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20 s and annealing 
and elongation at 60°C for 22 s, and the final step of 95°C 
for 1  min, 55°C for 30  s, 95°C for 30  s. The Stratagene 
MxPro software was used to quantify the original amount 
of DNA present for each gene, which could then be 
related to the copy number.
3    Results and discussion
To enable rapid iterative cycles of metabolic engineering, 
we developed a new vector toolkit EasyClone-Marker-
Free, which allows integration of genes into specific sites 
of the yeast chromosome without integration of a selec-
tion marker. This simplifies strain design and reduces the 
turnaround time in comparison to the previously pub-
lished EasyClone methods [5, 6]. The method employs 
CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce one or several DSBs into the 
host chromosome, ensuring efficient integration. For this 
system to be active in S. cerevisiae, it is necessary to have 
a Cas9 expression plasmid, as well as a gRNA helper vec-
tor. The DSB is repaired by the host cell using the native 
HR machinery, which incorporates the EasyClone-Mark-
erFree vector(s) into the target loci via double cross-over. 
3.1     Construction of EasyClone-MarkerFree vector 
toolkit
Construction of the EasyClone vector set required that 
11 gRNA helper vectors were built, one to target each of 
the EasyClone chromosomal integration sites in the 
S.  cerevisiae CEN.PK strain. Furthermore, three triple 
gRNA helper vectors were built that can target three sites 
simultaneously. The EasyClone 2.0 vectors were modified 
to remove the selection markers and, where necessary, to 
mutate the PAM sites in the integration sites. The vectors 
contain a USER cloning site surrounded by bi-directional 
terminators. Genes and promoters can be cloned into the 
vectors using USER cloning as described below or other 
methods, such as Gibson assembly, in-fusion, MoClo, etc. 
[29].
3.2    Workflow
The suggested workflow is illustrated on Fig. 1. For USER 
cloning, the EasyClone-MarkerFree vectors are prepared 
by linearization with AsiSI and nicking with Nb.BsmI in 
order to obtain vector backbones with sticky ends. The 
treated vector backbones are stored at -20°C. Compatible 
biobricks, encoding genes and promoters, are prepared 
by PCR amplification using oligos with a uracil base, 7–10 
bases downstream of the 5’ end of the primers (Fig. 1a). 
We routinely use the overhangs as specified in [5] for all of 
our genes and promoters, which simplifies standardiza-
tion and exchange of biobricks between scientists in our 
laboratory. We store the library of ready-to-use genes and 
promoters at -20°C. 
To clone promoters and genes into the expression vec-
tor, the AsiSI/Nb.BsmI-treated vector backbones are 
mixed with the desired promoter(s) and gene(s) and 
treated with USER enzyme. The USER enzyme excises 
uracils in the overhangs of genes and promoters, thus 
producing sticky ends compatible with the EasyClone 
vectors (Fig. 1b). The USER reaction mix is transformed 
into E. coli, which ligates the expression vector (Fig. 1c). 
The plasmids can then be isolated, confirmed by sequenc-
ing and linearized with NotI (or another suitable) restric-
tion enzyme to produce linear integration fragments 
containing expression cassettes flanked with ~500-bp-
long integration regions (Fig. 1d). The linear integration 
fragment(s) and the corresponding helper vector are then 
transformed into the yeast host cell already carrying a 
Cas9 expression plasmid (Fig. 1e). The transformants are 
selected on medium with G418 and nourseothricin to 
select for the Cas9 and gRNA helper vector, respectively. 
If further CRISPR-Cas9 mediated engineering rounds are 
desired, the gRNA helper vector is removed by cultivating 
the cells in liquid or solid medium containing G418 to 
maintain the selection for Cas9 (Fig. 1f). gRNA helper vec-
tors are 2µ-based and according to our experience are 
easily lost by growing the cells overnight in liquid medi-
um with G418 only. The resulting culture is diluted and 
plated on G418 plates to obtain single colonies. The loss 
of the gRNA helper vector is confirmed by replica plating 
onto nourseothricin agar plates. The strains are then 
ready for the next round of Cas9-mediated gene insertions 
or other manipulations (e.g. knock-outs, etc.). If no further 
genetic modifications are desired, the strains can be cul-
tivated on non-selective medium to eliminate both Cas9 
and gRNA helper vectors. 
3.3    Validation of the vector toolkit
To verify the integration efficiency and gene expression 
levels at each site, gfp was cloned into each of the Easy-
Clone vectors and transformed into the CEN.PK113-7D 
strain. The integrations were tested by colony PCR for 20 
randomly picked clones, and 95–100% correct integra-
tions were obtained for all the integration sites (Fig. 2). 
This is comparable with the previous versions of Easy-
Clone, where the targeting efficiency was 80–100% [5, 6]. 
However, we should note that wrong clones in the Easy-
Clone-MarkerFree system were not fluorescent and hence 
they did not contain the designed integration cassettes in

Figure 1.  An overview of the EasyClone-MarkerFree method. The BioBricks encoding genes and promoters are generated by PCR-amplification with uracil-
containing primers (a). The BioBricks are assembled with the integration vectors via USER cloning (b) and the reaction mixture is transformed into E. coli 
(c). The resulting plasmids are isolated from E. coli and confirmed by sequencing, then they are linearized and transformed into Cas9-expressing S. cerevisi-
ae along with a helper gRNA vector, which causes double-stranded breaks at the designated integration sites (d–e). Yeast cells are selected on plates with 
G418 and nourseothricin and correct integration of the vector(s) is confirmed by PCR. The helper gRNA vector can be eliminated by growth in the absence 
of nourseothricin selection and the resulting strain, which still expresses Cas9, can be further engineered. Once the desired genetic modifications are 
accomplished the Cas9 vector is removed by growth on non-selective medium and the final strain, not containing selection markers, is obtained (f).

their genomes, while for the EasyClone system with 
selection markers, the integration cassette would always 
be integrated in the genome, however sometimes it 
would not be targeted to the designed integration site. 
Further, the transformed colonies were each checked for 
fluorescence, with 99% of the colonies showing fluores-
cence (84–559 colonies were obtained and tested per 
transformation). Fluorescence levels showed some small-
er variations for different integration sites (Fig. 2) as we 
also observed previously [6]. Another observation was 
that among those clones with an integrated fragment, all 
clones were fluorescent, which differs from the results we 
obtained with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated insertion of expres-
sion fragments with short homology arms (40 bp), where 
only half of the clones were fluorescent [17]. We suggest 
that the high fidelity of correct integration is due to the 
long homology arms of ~0.5 kb present in the EasyClone 
vectors.
We further tested the stability of the integrations of 
the gfp gene in each of the sites. After five passages, the 
population retained 100% of fluorescent colonies, reinforc-
ing the notion that these sites are stable due to their loca-
tion in-between essential genes.
The simultaneous targeting of three integration sites, 
assisted with triple gRNA helper vectors, resulted in 
60–70% targeting efficiencies, which is also comparable 
with previously reported efficiencies for CRISPR-Cas9 
methods for multi-loci integration [16, 18]. We previously 
observed for the EasyClone system with selection mark-
ers that targeting efficiency into the same chromosome 
was only 44%, however the efficiency is higher for simul-
taneous integration into different chromosomes (unpub-
lished results). We believe that simultaneous targeting of 
three sites that are closely positioned on the same chro-
mosome, may lead to genome instability. Therefore to 
achieve the best targeting efficiencies, triple gRNA help-
er vectors were designed to target distinct chromosomes.
3.4     Application of EasyClone-MarkerFree vector 
toolkit for engineering of precursor supply  
for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production
As a test case, a pathway to produce 3HP was inserted 
into two different S. cerevisiae strains, CEN.PK113-7D 
and Ethanol Red, and the strains were further engineered 
for improved acetyl-CoA supply. The basic pathway 
strains were constructed by inserting a modified acetyl-
CoA carboxylase ACC1
S659A,S1157A and a malonyl-CoA 
reductase MCR from Chloroflexus aurantiacus. Three dif-
ferent strategies to boost acetyl-CoA production in the 
cytosol were compared (Fig.  3A). One of the strategies 
relied on expression of a functional bacterial pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex from Enterococcus faecalis in 
the cytoplasm, which required expression of genes encod-
ing subunits E1α, E1β, E2, and E3 of PDH complex, as well 
as two genes involved in lipoylation of E2 [30]. Another 
strategy was based on overexpression of the pyruvate 
dehydrogenase bypass, namely pyruvate decarboxylase 
PDC1, aldehyde dehydrogenase ALD6 and acetyl-CoA 
synthase from Salmonella enterica ACS
SE [31]. The third 
strategy encompassed overexpression of ATP-dependent 
citrate lyase, consisting of two subunits ACL1 and ACL2, 
and a mitochondrial citrate transporter protein from 
Y.  lipolytica. The genes required for different strategies 
were cloned into three EasyClone-MarkerFree plasmids 
and transformed into yeast strains expressing basic 3HP 
pathway along with the triple gRNA helper vector 
(pCfB3052 for CEN.PK and pCfB4668 for Ethanol Red). 
Overexpression of the cytoplasmic PDH complex 
proved to be the most successful strategy in CEN.PK, with 
an improvement in 3HP final titer of 19% over the basic 
strain in mineral medium, and 95% in the simulated fed-
batch medium (Fig.  3). The PDH bypass showed no 
improvement. The ACL strategy performed worse than 
the basic pathway in MM, but interestingly showed an 
improvement of 60% in FIT (Fig. 3B). Growth profiles can 
be found in Supporting information, Fig. S1.
In the diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red), the PDH 
complex also performed well, with an improvement of 23% 
over the basic strain (Supporting information, Fig.  S2). 
These results confirm that the bacterial PDH complex 
from Enterococcus faecalis is a robust and efficient way to 
improve cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels in yeast. We con-
firmed that EasyClone-MarkerFree method integrates the 
expression cassettes on both homologous chromosomes, 
when applied in diploid strains. We performed qPCR on 
the diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) carrying the 
genes for the PDH complex. All of the six genes were 
shown to have a copy number of 2. The PDH bypass 
seems to have performed poorly, contradicting previous 
Figure 2.  Validation of the EasyClone-MarkerFree vector toolkit. The labo-
ratory strain, CEN.PK 117-7D, was transformed with the EasyClone-Mark-
erFree vectors carrying gfp gene under control of a constitutive PTEF1 pro-
moter. Specific fluorescence was measured to evaluate the expression 
 level at each of the eleven integration sites. The error bars show standard 
deviation between nine or ten replicates. The percentage of clones with 
correct integration is shown for each site n = 20.

works. This may be due to the low activity of the 3HP 
biosynthetic genes in this work, as we only integrated 
ACC1 and MCR in single copies. In other studies, where 
we expressed ACC1 and MCR from either a high-copy 
episomal vector or integrated them in multiple copies into 
the genome, the overexpression of PDH bypass did have 
a positive effect on the 3HP production [32–34]. 
4    Concluding remarks
The EasyClone-MarkerFree vector toolkit can be used to 
simultaneously introduce one to three integration cas-
settes into the genome of S. cerevisiae without the use of 
selection markers. Using standardized BioBricks, the 
integration cassettes can be constructed for overexpres-
sion of one or two genes per integration site. In this study 
we successfully integrated up to six genes in a single 
transformation with 60–70% targeting efficiency. The 
system is well suited for strain construction via multiple 
iterative metabolic engineering cycles. We have shown 
that it performs well in both the haploid laboratory CEN.
PK strain, and also in the diploid industrial Ethanol Red 
strain. The EasyClone-MarkerFree vector toolkit can be 
obtained from AddGene.
