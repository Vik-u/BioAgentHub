Abstract 
Background: Hydroxyl acid is an important platform chemical that covers many industrial applications due to 
its dual functional modules. At present, the traditional technology for hydroxyl acid production mainly adopts the 
petroleum route with benzene, cyclohexane, butadiene and other non-renewable resources as raw materials which 
violates the development law of green chemistry. Conversely, it is well-known that biotechnology and bioengineering 
techniques possess several advantages over chemical methods, such as moderate reaction conditions, high chemi-
cal selectivity, and environmental-friendly. However, compared with chemical engineering, there are still some major 
obstacles in the industrial application of biotechnology. The critical issue of the competitiveness between bioengi-
neering and chemical engineering is products titer and volume productivity. Therefore, based on the importance 
of hydroxyl acids in many fields, exploring a clean, practical and environmental-friendly preparation process of the 
hydroxyl acids is the core purpose of this study.
Results: To obtain high-purity hydroxyl acid, a microbiological regulation for its bioproduction by Gluconobacter 
oxydans was constructed. In the study, we found a critical point of chain length determine the end-products. Glu-
conobacter oxydans catalyzed diols with chain length ≤ 4, forming hydroxyl acids, and converting 1,5-pentylene glycol 
and 1,6-hexylene glycol to diacids. Based on this principle, we successfully synthesized 75.3 g/L glycolic acid, 83.2 g/L 
3-hydroxypropionic acid, and 94.3 g/L 4-hydroxybutyric acid within 48 h. Furthermore, we directionally controlled the 
products of C5/C6 diols by adjusting pH, resulting in 102.3 g/L 5-hydroxyvaleric acid and 48.8 g/L 6-hydroxycaproic 
acid instead of diacids. Combining pH regulation and cell-recycling technology in sealed-oxygen supply bioreactor, 
we prepared 271.4 g 5-hydroxyvaleric acid and 129.4 g 6-hydroxycaproic acid in 6 rounds.
Conclusions: In this study, a green scheme of employing G. oxydans as biocatalyst for superior-quality hydroxyl acids 
(C2–C6) production is raised up. The proposed strategy commendably demonstrated a novel technology with simple 
pH regulation for high-value production of hydroxyl acids via green bioprocess developments.

Introduction
Consumption of traditional petrochemical resources 
leads to environmental pollution, causing toxicity, car -
cinogenicity, and biological aggregation of harmful 
chemical substances. Moreover, excessive use of coal, oil 
and natural gas makes the non-renewable resources on 
earth increasingly scarce [1, 2]. Hence, to overcome the 
dilemma of insufficient resources and low utilization,

green synthesis methods have been developed. As results, 
these environmentally friendly economics has become 
an important technology impetus in recent years [3, 4]. 
Consequently, green methods for amino acids, vitamins, 
polymers, and other chemicals production have been 
recently reported [5, 6].
Hydroxyl acid  (HOCH2–(CH2)n–COOH) is an impor -
tant bioresource intermediates containing both hydroxyl 
and carboxyl groups at terminal positions [7, 8]. Due 
to the unique properties of dual-functional module, 
hydroxyl acids can be converted to various fine chemi -
cal intermediates and biopolymer precursors [9–11]. 
Especially, because of the excellent biocompatibility and 
biodegradability, they have become the spotlight of the 
medical polymers industry [12–14]. However, the exist -
ing hydroxyl acid production technology, oxidation or 
reduction via chemical catalysts or biocatalysts, has low 
yield and high environmental toxicity [15–17]. In chemi -
cal catalysis, serious by-products are generated due to 
the redox relationship between hydroxyl and carboxyl 
groups [18]. For example, the most common method 
for the synthesis of glycolic acid (GA) in the industry is 
chloroacetic acid or hydroxy acetonitrile hydrolysis [19]. 
However, the raw materials applied in two processes are 
highly toxic and corrosive, causing environmental pol -
lution and safety issues. Moreover, the preparation of 
hydroxy acids by fermentation is also a hot research 
field, although fermentation technology has not been 
adopted in industry. At present, many hydroxyl acids 
have been successfully synthesized by employing recom -
binant microorganisms such as Escherichia coli [20, 21], 
Klebsiella pneumoniae [22, 23], and Corynebacterium 
glutamicum [24, 25]. However, fermentation technology 
has some inherent disadvantages of high cost and long 
reaction cycle, which limits its application in large-scale 
industrial production [26]. Therefore, the development 
of a green and environmental-friendly technology is 
required for preparing high-quality hydroxyl acids.
Biocatalysis, a promising approach for sustainable 
development of industry in the future, has applied in 
various fields, including food, chemical, medicine, envi -
ronmental, and energy [27, 28]. Hence, in-depth devel -
opment and application of biocatalysis technology in the 
production of hydroxyl acids would provide a promis -
ing direction for the industrial production. Gluconobac -
ter oxydans (G. oxydans) is a Gram-negative bacterium 
known for its incomplete oxidation capability, attributed 
to the membrane-bound dehydrogenases [29, 30] such 
as alcohol [31], aldehyde [32], glycerol [33], and sorbitol 
dehydrogenases [34]. These membrane-bound dehydro -
genases are mainly responsible for catalyzing alcohols 
and aldehydes to corresponding acids and ketones. Fur -
thermore, membrane-bound dehydrogenases are directly 
located on the cell membrane, and substrates are oxidized

into products and released into the periplasm without 
carrier transport, considerably improving the catalytic 
efficiency [35]. These properties enabled G. oxydans to 
be employed as a common industrial biocatalyst for the 
industrial production of vitamin C [36], xylonic acid [37], 
and gluconic acid [38]. In addition, glycolic acid, furoic 
acid, 2-hydroxyacetone, and other platform compounds 
are also preliminarily synthesized on an industrial scale 
[39, 40]. These special characteristics, coupled with strict 
regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of G. oxydans, have 
facilitated the large-scale production of hydroxyl acids. 
In addition, depending on G. oxydans, Sang-Hyun et al. 
have realized the bio-preparation of 6-hydroxycaproic 
acid (6-HCA) recently. During 100 h continuous whole-
cell catalysis, about 350  mg 6-HCA was selectively pro -
duced in 10  mL broth with a fed-batch mode (35  g/L) 
[41]. However, the low productivity (0.35  g/L/h) obvi -
ously could not satisfy the demand of large-scale produc -
tion. Therefore, this study was committed to combination 
of sealed oxygen-supplied technology and pH regulation 
to realize the efficient preparation of hydroxyl acid cover-
ing C2–C6.
Considering the bottlenecks in the industrial-scale 
preparation of hydroxyl acids, it is important to develop 
an efficient and green method by investigating the reac -
tion mechanism of G. oxydans whole-cell catalysis of 
primary diols for hydroxyl acids production. As results, 
combined SOS technology, we successfully achieved 
high-titer of GA, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HPA), and 
4-hydroxybutyric acid (4-HBA). Furthermore, a green 
route for whole-cell catalysis can precisely control the 
production of 5-hydroxyvaleric acid (5-HVA) and 6-HCA 
by pH regulation.

Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). All other chemicals were of 
analytical grade and were commercially available.
Microorganism
Gluconobacter oxydans NL71 was isolated from G. oxy -
dans ATCC 621 using the crude lignocellulosic hydro -
lysate domestication process. The strain was preserved in 
sorbitol–agar medium containing 50  g/L sorbitol, 5  g/L 
yeast extract, and 15 g/L agar, at 4  ℃. The inoculum was 
cultivated in an Erlenmeyer flask at 30  ℃ for 24–36  h, 
with continuous agitation at 220 rpm using a mechanical 
shaker (New Brunswick Scientific). The nutrient medium 
was composed of 100  g/L sorbitol and 10  g/L yeast 
extract. Cultured cells were centrifuged at 6000  rpm at 
4  ℃, for 5–10  min in a freezing centrifuge (Avanti J-26 
XP , Beckman Coulter). Centrifuged cells were washed 
3 times with sterile saline and sterile water, respectively 
[42].
Whole‑cell catalysis
Bioprocess for whole-cell catalysis of 1,6-HG was car -
ried out in a 3-L bioreactor with 1 L broth containing 
G. oxydans with  OD600 = 10, 5  g/L yeast extract as the 
nitrogen source, and 0.5 g/L  MgSO4, 1 g/L  KH2PO4, 2 g/L 
 K2HPO4, and 5 g/L  (NH4)2SO4 as nutrients. Biocatalysis 
temperature was maintained at 30 °C and a stirring speed 
of 500  rpm. In addition, as G. oxydans is an obligate 
microorganism, oxygenation (purity ≥ 99.9) was main -
tained throughout the bioprocess. However, excessive 
oxygenation not only increases the cost but also leads to 
the wastage of resources due to low oxygen utilization. 
Considering that the whole-cell catalysis by G. oxydans 
is resting-cell catalysis without generating waste gas such 
as  CO2. Hence, we employed a sealed oxygen-supplied 
bioreactor (SOS-BR), as shown in Fig.  1, for whole-cell 
catalysis. The pressure of the reactor was controlled at 
0.03–0.05 MPa [43] and the pH of broth was adjusted by 
30% NaOH. For cell-cycling technology, G. oxydans was 
harvested via centrifugation at 6000–8000 rpm for 5 min 
under 4  °C and cell pellets were washed with deionized 
water. Finally, the bacteria were re-inserted into the fresh 
medium for a new round of whole-cell catalysis.
Analytical methods
The titer of EG, 1,3-PG, 1,4-BG, 1,5-PG, 1,6-HG, 
hydroxyl acids and diacids was detected by high-per -
formance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260 
Series) equipped with a differential detector. The column 
used for separation was the Aminex Bio-Rad HPX-87H 
and 5 mM  H2SO4 was used as mobile phase at a flow rate 
of 0.6 mL/min. Moreover, the yield of hydroxyl acid was 
calculated according to Formula 1 as follows:
Due to the difference in experiment data, three parallel 
assays were performed for each experiment to ensure the 
reliability of results.
Results and discussion
The whole‑cell catalysis of primary diols (C2–C6) by G. 
oxydans
Dual-functional modules of hydroxyl acids alleviate their 
application prospects in many high-end fields [44]. How -
ever, the traditional hydroxyl acid preparation methods 
would produce abundant of wastes and by-products, vio -
lating the principles of green chemistry and sustainable 
development. Hence, employing G. oxydans as a core 
catalyst to design a green and environmental-friendly 
hydroxyl acids synthesis method is an effective approach 
to solve the current industrial bottlenecks. To explore the 
reaction mechanism of G. oxydans whole-cell catalysis, 
five linear diols were selected as substrates for kinetic 
study with  OD600 = 2. Figure  2 depicts the bioprocesses 
for the catalysis of EG, 1,3-PG, and 1,4-BG by G. oxy -
dans. The final catalytic products were GA, 3-HPA, and 
4-HBA, respectively, without the formation of diacids. 
The average consumption rates of EG, 1,3-PG, and 1,4-
BG were 0.68, 1.55, 2.23  g/L/h, respectively. Compared 
with the chemical method, the purity of products was sat-
isfactory, meeting the core requirements of green chem -
istry, and the HPLC chromatograms in Additional file  1:

Figures S1, S2 and Fig. 3. However, the reaction efficiency 
still needed to be improved to meet the requirements for 
industrial production.
Figure 2 shows the biocatalysis of 1,5-PG and 1,6-HG 
by G. oxydans, respectively. Surprisingly, when the car -
bon chain length was ≥ 5, the end products showed quali-
tative differences. 1,5-PG and 1,6-HG catalysis followed 
a step-by-step process, further catalyzing to GTA and 
AA when primary diols were oxidized to hydroxyl acids. 
Moreover, the catalytic rates for 1,5-PG and 1,6-HG were 
very similar. The substrate consumption time was less 
than 3 h and 4 h, while the average substrate consump -
tion rates reached 3.25 and 5.38  g/L/h, respectively. 
Although the reaction efficiency of C5/C6 was promis -
ing, the product quality was not satisfactory due to the 
formation of by-products (diacids). At present, hydroxyl 
acids have attracted much attention due to their dual-
functional modules, which exhibit excelling properties. 
Hence, we need further explored directional regulation 
for hydroxyl acids production by G. oxydans to lay a the -
oretical foundation for the industrial production.
The whole‑cell catalysis of primary diols (C2–C4) by G. 
oxydans combined with SOS technology
Previous studies indicated that G. oxydans could bio-
transform EG, 1,3-PG, and 1,4-BG into hydroxyl acids. 
Although the purity of the products met the green chem-
istry and industrial production requirements, the cata -
lytic efficiency was low to strengthen the production 
economy. G. oxydans takes oxygen as the final electron 
receptor, so the whole-cell catalysis requires a lot of oxy -
gen carriers to enhance the catalytic rate [45, 46]. How-
ever, the high cost of unrestricted oxygen supply cannot 
be borne by the industry. Therefore, in this study, SOS 
technology was employed to maximize oxygen utilization 
while ensuring high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, SOS 
technology safely controls the pressure in the bioreactor

by adjusting the oxygen inlet speed, eliminating the 
potential safety hazards in industrial production [43].
As shown in Fig.  3, 48  h whole-cell catalysis of EG, 
1,3-PG, and 1,4-BG were carried out in SOS-BR with G. 
oxydans  OD600 = 2. Results indicated that GA, in the 48 h 
bioprocess, 3-HPA and 4-HBA accumulated 75.3  g/L, 
83.2 g/L, and 94.3 g/L respectively. In terms of GA pro -
duction, the highest quantity of GA obtained was 74.5 g/L 
with a productivity of 1.49 g/L/h by Wei et al. [47], which 
was lower than 1.6  g/L/h obtained in this study. Sun 
et  al. reported a recombinant Escherichia coli that pro -
duce 38.7 g 3-HPA with an average yield of 35% in 72 h 
fermentation [48], the productivity was lower than SOS 
technology and numerous by-products were found. For 
4-HBA, Sang et  al. [49] employed recombinant Escheri -
chia coli  to produce 103.4  g/L under the microaerobic 
conditions with a productivity of 0.844  g/L/h. Although 
the concentration of 4-HBA was slightly higher than that 
of whole-cell catalysis, its productivity was only 43% of 
SOS technology. Furthermore, a lot of inhibitors such as 
acetic acid were generated in the fermentation broth of 
recombinant Escherichia coli, which seriously affected 
the product quality. Apparently, the whole-cell cataly -
sis with G. oxydans, combined with SOS technology has 
realized the continuous and efficient preparation of high-
purity hydroxyl acids (C2–C4), which provided solid 
technical support for their industrial production.
Bioprocess for 5‑HVA preparation with pH regulation 
and cell‑recycling technology in SOS‑BR
A previous study showed that 5-HVA could be produced 
by G. oxydans, its production level was rather unsatisfac -
tory, and GTA was accumulated in the system as a by-
product. Moreover, the traditional chemical methods 
cannot prepare high-quality 5-HVA due to high cost, 
which limits their application in advanced fields such 
as medicine and material science. Therefore, targeted 
regulation for selective catalysis of 1,5-PG is a promis -
ing approach for the industrial production. As shown in 
Fig. 4, the whole-cell catalysis of 1,5-PG was performed 
under different pH gradients, including pH = 2.5, 3.5, 
4.5, 5.5 and 6,5. When pH ≥ 5.5, GTA was not produced 
even if the substrate 1,5-PG was completely bio-oxidized 
to 5-HVA. However, when pH value was less than 5.5, 
the whole-cell catalysis showed two-stage reactions; 1,5-
PG generated 5-HVA in the first step, and then 5-HVA 
was catalyzed to GTA in the second step. It is notewor -
thy that the results at pH = 2.5 were contrary to the law, 
because normal physiological activity could not be main -
tained under extremely acidic conditions, and G. oxydans 
lost catalytic activity after 2  h. Therefore, the proposed 
scheme of pH-regulated whole-cell catalysis provided a 
green and high-quality approach for the industrial pro -
duction of 5-HVA without any by-products. To direc -
tionally obtain an ultra-high titer of 5-HVA, we selected 
pH = 5.5 for the bioreactor experiment.
In 2019, Keiichi et  al. employed over-supported plati -
num catalysts to produce 5-HVA, δ-valerolactone, and 
methyl 5-hydroxyvalerate with the yield of 62% [17]. 
The results revealed that the yield was low and there 
were abundant of derivatives, which seriously affected 
the purity of products. Moreover, in 2021, Hee et  al. 
reported the fermentative production of 5-HVA by 
metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum, 
and 55 g/L 5-HVA and 10 g/L GTA were produced after 
28  h fermentation [50]. Apparently, their designed bio -
process was not suitable for industrial-scale production 
of 5-HVA. Hence, we conducted whole-cell catalysis for 
5-HVA bio-production in SOS-BR with pH regulation 
at 5.5 (Fig.  5A). Results showed that 102.3 g/L of 5-HVA

was accumulated without the formation of diacids dur -
ing 48  h whole-cell catalysis with average productivity 
of 2.1  g/L/h, and the HPLC chromatograms was shown 
in Additional file  1: Figure S4. Simultaneously, the pro -
duction in the first 10 h was 58.9 g/L and the productiv -
ity was 5.9  g/L/h, exceeding the highest level of 5-HVA 
(55 g/L during 28 h). The fermentation broth contained 
only 0.2  g/L substrates, without any diacid production 
at 48 h, and 5-HVA yield was as high as 99.4%. In addi -
tion, SOS-BR maintained a high dissolved oxygen (DO) 
level during the whole-cell catalysis process to meet the 
oxygen demand for G. oxydans. At the same time, due 
to the strict sealing environment of the entire system, 
the cost of oxygen utilization was greatly saved and the 
economy of the entire bioprocess was improved. Moreo -
ver, we successfully performed cell-recycling technology 
with 6 rounds in SOS-BR (Fig.  5B). During 48 h whole-
cell catalysis, a total of 274.1 g 5-HVA was accumulated, 
and the production of each round was 52.5 g/L, 47.8 g/L, 
46.7 g/L, 44.8 g/L, 40.2 g/L, and 39.4 g/L, respectively. In 
conclusion, combined with pH control and SOS-BR tech-
nology, we successfully synthesized 5-HVA with high-
quality and ultra-high titer, which provided a promising 
avenue for the industrialization of 5-HVA.
Bioprocess for 6‑HCA synthesis with pH regulation 
and cell‑recycling technology in SOS‑BR
Compared with other hydroxyl acids, the industrial 
production technology of 6-HCA is currently unavail -
able. As 6-HCA is an intermediate, hydroxyl and car -
boxyl groups often undergo oxidation or reduction 
during synthesis to generate 1,6-HG, AA, and other by-
products. At present, there is a little literature on the 
preparation of 6-HCA. In 1999, Fischer et al. employed 
metal catalysts to prepare 6-HCA at high temperature 
(100 ~ 300℃) and high pressure (10 ~ 300 bar), but the 
products were accompanied by abundant 1,6-HG and 
esters [51]. Therefore, it was significant to develop a

green and efficient synthesis of 6-HCA by G. oxydans. 
Results revealed that the pH value of fermentation 
broth had an obvious regulatory effect on the whole-
cell catalytic process (Fig.  6). At pH ≤ 6, the whole-
cell catalysis of 1,6-HG was divided into two stages. 
The first step was to oxidize 1,6-HG to an intermedi -
ate product 6-HCA, and then convert it to AA. Sur -
prisingly, when the pH of broth was adjusted to 7, the 
conventional two-stage catalysis was regulated at the 
first stage. The results suggested that when 1,6-HG 
was oxidized to 6-HCA, it would not further react to 
form AA, improving the product quality of 6-HCA and 
eliminating the formation of by-products. According to 
previous research results, the weak acidic environment 
was more suitable for the physiological and biochemi -
cal capacity of G. oxydans, hence, pH = 7 was selected 
for 6-HCA biopreparation.
According to the results of pH regulation experiment, 
the whole-cell catalysis for the preparation of 6-HCA 
was performed at pH = 7 (Fig.  7A). In fed-batch mode, 
48.8 g/L of 6-HCA with the yield of 68.7% was accumu -
lated within 48  h, and the productivity was 1.01  g/L/h, 
which was the highest reported level for 6-HCA bio -
preparation. Moreover, the HPLC chromatogram was 
shown in Additional file  1: Figure S5. Compared with 
Sang-Hyun et al., the productivity increased 188.6% from 
0.35 g/L/h to 1.01 g/L/h [41]. The kinetic curve showed 
that the inhibition effect was evident after the formation 
of hydroxyl acids and the productivity decreased from 
4.5 g/L/h to 0.3 g/L/h. When the catalysis was performed 
for 8 h, the productivity decreased to 2 g/L/h, 50% lower 
than that of the initial level. Therefore, we performed 
6 rounds of cell-recycling experiment for single batch 
catalysis, and the results are shown in Fig.  7B. During 
48 h of whole-cell catalysis, the cell-recycling experiment 
was successfully implemented for 6 rounds, and the last 
round still maintained 72.9% capacity. Finally, 129.3 g of 
6-HCA was accumulated, with average productivity of 
2.7  g/h, which was 1.6 times that of one batch for 48  h 
continuous catalysis. The importance of 6-HCA under -
scores its social demands, but the existing technologies 
cannot support the market demands. Therefore, the 
preparation method of 6-HCA proposed in the study, 
overcomes the disadvantages of traditional methods, 
demonstrating promise for the industrial production of 
6-HCA in the future.
Conclusions
In this study, a microbiological regulation process for 
high value-added hydroxyl acids synthesis from primary 
diols by G. oxydans was successfully established. Com -
bined with SOS technology, the whole-cell catalytic syn -
thesis of high-titer GA, 3-HPA, and 4-HBA was realized. 
Further enhancement in 5-HPA and 6-HCA production 
was successfully realized by pH regulation without any 
diacids generated. In conclusion, the whole-cell catalysis 
of diols by G. oxydans for industrial-scale preparation of 
hydroxyl acids was established. Moreover, the mild con -
dition of whole-cell catalysis agrees well with the prin -
ciples of green synthesis for the environment-friendly 
production of hydroxyl acids.
