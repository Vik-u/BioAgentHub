Abstract Increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) con-
tributes to hyperlipidemia, MASLD, and ASCVD in
insulin-resistant subjects. However, multiple path-
ways support lipogenesis and few have sought to
quantify the contributions of the discrete metabolic
pathways that contribute to lipogenesis. In this study,
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting glucoki-
nase ( Gck), lactate dehydrogenase A ( Ldha), and
glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 (Gpt2) were utilized
to restrict substrate flux from lipogenic precursors in
C57BL6/J mice, comparing controls (CO) and chronic
overnutrition (ON). In CO mice, ASO treatments did
not significantly alter lipogenesis; however, there was
a trend toward decreased hepatic triglyceride content
and DNL, especially with the GPT2 ASO
(TG ¼¡46.8%; DNL¼¡53.7%). Expectedly, increased
hepatic TG content and DNL (ON vs. CO:
TG ¼þ187.9%; DNL¼þ41.8%) were observed in mice
with chronic overnutrition. Gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated increased
hepatic TCA cycle metabolites (ON vs. CO:
fumarate þ74.2%; malate þ54.0%; and citrateþ43.2)
and decreased hepatic concentrations of multiple
amino acids (ON vs. CO: Leu ¡41.7%; Ile ¡45.0%;
Val ¡56.3%; Ser ¡22.6%). With ON, TG content and
DNL were reduced by restricting lipogenic carbon
entry from alanine (GPT2: TG ¼¡ 45.5%;
DNL ¼¡ 48.1%), lactate (LDHA: TG ¼¡ 25.8%;
DNL ¼¡ 33.1%), or glucose (GCK: TG ¼¡ 59.2%;
DNL ¼¡69.2%). Amino acids appear to be a consistent
carbon source for DNL in mice; however, carbon entry
from all sources is required to maintain the signifi-
cantly elevated rates of hepatic DNL in chronically
overfed mice.
These findings may inform the
development of novel therapies and underscore the
importance of peripheral substrate storage and
oxidation in the prevention of dyslipidemia in the
metabolic syndrome.

Disordered lipid metabolism is a hallmark of insulin
resistance and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Insulin-resistant
patients experience high rates of metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD),
the most common chronic liver disease, and athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading
cause of morbidity and mortality for diabetic patients)
(1–3). Increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a
central feature of dysregulated lipid metabolism (4–6).
While carbon flux to the liver is well known to be
altered in insulin-resistant animals, the discrete path-
ways that contribute to increased DNL in insulin-
resistant animals are yet to be determined.
Nutrients influence hepatic DNL through multiple
mechanisms. They can act as substrates, providing an
influx of carbon into citrate, or can act to regulate the
transcription regulation of lipogenesis; either directly,
or through hormonal regulation. Insulin action, in
response to glucose, stimulates DNL via sterol regu-
latory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which
activates the transcription of genes encoding enzymes
required for lipid synthesis (7–9). However, changes in
substrate flux may play a critical role in supporting
the increase in DNL observed in the setting of insulin
resistance (10–12). One mechanism by which substrate,
specifically glucose or fructose, can directly regulate
DNL is via activation of the lipogenic transcription
factor carbohydrate response element binding pro-
tein (ChREBP) (13, 14). This process is adept at acti-
vating lipogenic machinery to promote energy
storage in response to a high-carbohydrate meal, but
chronic overconsumption of sugar induces hepatic
lipid deposition, contributing to the development of
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver dis-
ease (MASLD) (15). Beyond the transcriptional regu-
lation of lipid metabolism afforded by insulin-driven
SREBP-1c and carbohydrate-driven ChREBP, multiple

substrate fluxes are thought to contribute to DNL via
substrate push ( 12, 16, 17). Multiple substrates,
including lactate, amino acids, glucose, and fructose,
provide carbon for mitochondrial pyruvate and drive
hepatic DNL ( 18). Furthermore, in insulin-resistant
subjects, a surplus of these substrates ( 19) is associ-
ated with an increase in DNL and can drive the
development of MASLD ( 20). Although it is estab-
lished that metabolic fluxes are perturbed in the
insulin-resistant subject, the role of specific substrate
contributors to hepatic DNL has not been sufficiently
studied to answer this critical question. If increased
DNL in the insulin-resistant liver is not solely due to
altered transcription of lipogenic regulators, it may
also be due to one or more carbon fluxes that support
the production of mitochondrial pyruvate leading to
increased DNL via citrate synthesis.
In the present study, we sought to elucidate the
contribution of different substrates that support mito-
chondrial pyruvate metabolism and hepatic DNL dur-
ing hepatic insulin resistance, which is well described to
develop with chronic overnutrition (21, 22). To address
this question, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) target-
ing glucokinase (Gck), lactate dehydrogenase (Ldha), and
glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 (Gpt2) were applied to
restrict substrate influx from specific lipogenic pre-
cursors in both control and chronic overnutrition
chronic overnutrition C57BL6/J mice. This will provide
a deeper understanding of the roles of individual
pyruvate-producing substrates when DNL is increased
in the setting of insulin resistance and should inform
future studies of novel therapies for the treatment of
lipid dysmetabolism in insulin-resistant patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
C57BL/6 mice (9 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals were housed
under controlled temperature (23◦C) and lighting (12 h light/
dark cycle, lights on at 07:00) with free access to water and
food. Mice were maintained on standard regular chow
(Envigo 2108S: 24% protein, 58% carbohydrate, 18% fat;
Envigo, Madison WI, USA) and were placed on a high-fat diet
(HFD) (Research Diets D12492: 20% protein, 20% carbohy-
drate, 60% fat; Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA)
for the study.
One cohort of mice was fed an HFD for 6 weeks to induce
whole-body lipid-induced insulin resistance, which is
described to develop in mice in a tissue-specific manner with
chronic overnutrition (21, 22). Another age-matched control
cohort was only fed the HFD for the final three days of the
study to provide a relatively insulin-sensitive group that is
matched in terms of dietary substrate composition (23). All
mice, from both the control (CO) and the chronic over-
nutrition (ON) cohorts, were provided 1% dextrose drinking
water for the final three days of the study to amplify the rates
of de novo lipogenesis that were blunted by the high-fat
feeding.
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were administered twice
by intraperitoneal injection, one week apart, beginning
10 days before the end of the study. A 2′-O-methoxyethyl
(MOE) glucokinase (Gck) ASO was compared with an MOE
control ASO, while N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) lactate
dehydrogenase A (Ldha) and glutamic pyruvate transaminase
2( Gpt2) ASOs were compared with a GalNAc control ASOs
(control ASOs do not target any known gene). The MOE ASO
dose was 75 mg/Kg-wk, while the GalNAc ASO dose was
15 mg/kg-wk.
All procedures were approved by the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee of the Yale University
School of Medicine. For the studies, mice were given ad
libitum access to food overnight and placed in restrainers
(without food) upon initiation of the light cycle (7am).
Animals were euthanized 3 –4 h later under isoflurane
anesthesia. Care was taken throughout the study to mini-
mize suffering.
In vivo de novo lipogenesis
Three days before sacrifice, total body water deuterium
enrichment was increased by a 23.4 ml/kg subcutaneous in-
jection of 99%2H-enriched saline (Cambridge Isotope Labo-
ratories). The mice were given 6% (vol/vol)2H2O-enriched
drinking water for the ensuing three days. Liver and plasma
were taken during euthanasia under isoflurane.
Triglyceride palmitate deuterium enrichment was deter-
mined by GC-MS and de novo hepatic palmitate synthesis was
calculated from isotopic data as previously described ( 11,
24–26). Hepatic lipid samples (in chloroform) were spotted
onto Silica gel 60 plates, and TLC was performed with a
mobile phase of hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1).
Plates were developed with 0.005% primuline in acetone:water
(80:20). Purified samples were collected while absorbed to
Silica and eluted with diethyl ester. Triglyceride-fatty acids
were analyzed by GC-MS (5975CI, Agilent Technologies) as
fatty acid methyl esters following derivatization with meth-
anolic boron trifluoride. The plasma2H2O pool was assessed
by the exchange of hydrogens from plasma to acetone in the
presence of sodium hydroxide; acetone deuterium enrich-
ment was analyzed by GC-MS.
U13 C glutamine tracer analysis
Uniformly labeled glutamine was infused in fed mice to
determine relative differences in label distribution within
the TCA induced by diet and ASO treatment. In preparation
for glutamine infusion, Instech catheters (Part Number:
C20PU) were placed in the jugular vein 7 days before the
infusions. Only mice that recovered more than 95% of their
preoperative body weight were studied. Mice were provided
ad libitum access to food overnight and all studies began at
08:00 the following morning. For infusions, awake mice un-
der gentle tail restraint underwent a primed-continuous
infusion of [13C5]glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Labora-
tories) at 18.0μmol/(kg-min) for 5 min. Infusion rates were
then lowered to 6.0 μmol/(kg-min) and the infusion
continued for 115 min. Blood samples were collected by tail
bleeding at 120′ for determination of plasma glucose and
insulin. All mice were anesthetized with intravenous pento-
barbital sodium injection (150 mg/kg), and tissues were
rapidly harvested and snap-frozen with clamps precooled in
liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored at−80◦C for subsequent
analysis.

Isotope enrichment and metabolic flux were assessed as
previously described (27). Briefly, metabolite concentrations
and 13C-enrichments were determined by mass spectrometry
using a 6500+ QQQ SelexION. Samples (4μl) were injected
onto a Hypercarb column (3μm particle size, 3× 150 mm,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Metab-
olites were eluted with a combination of aqueous (A: 2.0 mM
ammonium acetate and 12.5 mM triethylamine) and organic
mobile phase (B: 95% acetonitrile, 5% water 2.0 mM ammo-
nium acetate and 12.5 mM triethylamine) according to the
following gradient: t= 0 min, B= 0%; t = 0.5 min, B= 0%,
t = 5 min, B = 15%; t = 5.25 min, B = 50%; t = 6.25 min,
B = 50%; t = 6.5 min, B= 0%; t = 8 min, B= 0%. Metabolite
detection was based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
in negative mode using the source parameters in
Supplemental Table 1 . Separation Voltage (SV) and
Compensation Voltage (CoV) were optimized individually for
each metabolite in order to maximize signal intensity and
isobar resolution. The individual MRM transition pairs (Q1/
Q3) are listed inSupplemental Table 2. Retention times were
confirmed with known standards and peaks integrated using
El-Maven (Elucidata). The atomic percent excess (APE) was
calculated using the Polly interface (Elucidata) and corrected
for background noise and natural abundance. The sum of all
measured metabolites in each sample was used as an internal
control. Metabolite concentrations were normalized to protein
content determined by standard Bradford protein assay.
Hepatic triglyceride content
Hepatic triglycerides were extracted as previously
described (10). Briefly, lipids were extracted with 2:1 chloro-
form: methanol and triglyceride content were measured
(Sekisui Triglyceride-SL kit; Sekisui Diagnostics).
Plasma biochemical analysis
Glucose concentrations were determined using a YSI 2700
select (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH, USA)
or a standard spectrophotometric assay (Sekisui). Kits were
also used to measure nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs; Wako)
and triglyceride (Sekisui). Insulin was measured by radioim-
munoassay (EMD Millipore). Serum ALT (Abcam, ab105134)
and AST (Cayman Chemical, 701,640) were both measured by
colorimetric assay.
Hepatic biochemical analysis
Colorimetric assays were used to measure both hepatic
β-hydroxybutyrate (Cayman Chemical, 700,190) and acetoa-
cetate (Abcam, ab180875).
Immunoblotting
Proteins from tissue lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE
using a 4%–12% gradient gel and electroblotted onto poly-
vinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore). Mem-
branes were blocked with 3% BSA in TBST and incubated in
primary antibodies overnight. After washing, horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology; 1:5000) were applied for one hour and detection
was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence.
Primary antibodies used included β-Actin (Sigma, AC-15;
1:5000), GCK (Santa Cruz, 7908; 1:500), GPT2 (Proteintech,
16757-1-AP; 1:1000), and LDHA (Cell Signaling, 2012S; 1:5000).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Following tissue homogenization, RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy ® Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74,106). Following RNA
extraction, QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit was used to
produce cDNA (Qiagen, 205,311). Gene expression for genes
of interest was measured with quantitative real-time poly-
merase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The gene beta actin (Actb)
was used as an internal reference throughout all measured
genes. Primer sequences for the referenced genes are listed
(Table 1).
Metabolomics
TCA cycle, glycolysis, and amino acid intermediates were
analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in an
Agilent 5977B GC/MSD as previously described (28). Briefly,
20 mg of frozen liver were homogenized in a Next Advance
Bullet Blender, using 1 ml of cold water/methanol/acetoni-
trile (1:2:2). After centrifugation, supernatant solvents were
transferred into a GC vial and then dried with N2 gas. The
extracts were reconstituted with 20ul of MSTFA +1%
TBDMCS (N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide)
and 40ul of acetonitrile, and heated 45 min at 75C to generate
TMS derivatives, following the injection of 1μl of the sample
into the GCMS. TMS derivatives were identified by their
retention time and unique mass features using Electron Ion-
isation SIM. Compounds were quantified utilizing Internal
Standard calibration curves and Tricarballylic acid was added
as a surrogate. All metabolomics data, including undiscussed
data, is provided in the supplement.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10
(GraphPad Software). For direct comparisons between the two
groups, the Student ’s unpaired t test was utilized. When
comparing multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was used with
various post hoc analyses depending on the setting. If only
one control was being utilized in a comparison Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test was performed; however, in a com-
parison with multiple controls ˇSíd ´ak's multiple comparisons
test was used. In cases with direct comparisons to separate
controls, where the one-way ANOVA was significant, Fisher’s
LSD test was conducted. All data are expressed as
mean ± SEM. P values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.
RESULTS
Effect of ASO treatment in 3-day high-fat fed mice
is small
The impact of substrate restriction on DNL was first
assessed CO mice fed a high-fat diet and 1% dextrose
drinking water during the three days of DNL assess-
ment. Mice were administered ASO’s againstGck, Ldha,
and Gpt2 – reducing the hepatic gene expression and
protein abundance of the targeted enzymes (Fig. 1).
ASO treatments did not cause transaminitis, induce
weight loss, or create any significant changes to tail-vein
blood glucose or insulin levels (Table 2).
In the CO mice the effect of ASO treatment was
small and not significant; however, each ASO induced a
decrease in both hepatic lipogenesis (GCK: 33%,P < 0.2;
Overnutrition fuels DNL by multiple substrates 3
LDHA: 30%; GPT2: 54%, P < 0.06) and triglyceride
content (GCK: 20%; LDHA: 13%; GPT2: 47%,P < 0.07)
(Fig. 2). For changes in parameters without a statedP-
value, P > 0.3.
DNL is increased in 6-week HFD-fed mice
Six-week high-fat diet-fed mice (overnutrition), as
compared with 3-day high-fat diet-fed mice (control),
have a significant increase in hepatic lipogenesis (42%),
as well as significantly increased liver (188%) and serum
(79%) TG concentrations (Fig. 3). This is consistent with
data previously described in both mouse models and in
humans, where insulin-resistant subjects have increased
levels of DNL when compared to insulin-sensitive sub-
jects (4, 6, 11, 29). Furthermore, the hepatic concentra-
tions of many metabolites of intermediary metabolism
were assessed via a GC-MS-based metabolomics
approach. Critical hepatic TCA cycle intermediates,
including fumarate, malate, and citrate, are significantly
increased in the ON mice (ON control vs. CO control:
fumarate +74.2% ± 78.4, P < 0.05; malate+54.0% ± 35.5,
P < 0.05; and citrate+43.2 ± 25.6, P < 0.001). Interestingly,
several amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine, valine,
and serine, have significantly decreased hepatic con-
centrations in the ON mice (ON control vs. CO Control:
Leu −41.7% ± 30.4, P < 0.01; Ile−45.0% ± 26.9, P < 0.01;
Val −56.3% ± 22.0, P < 0.001; Ser−22.6 ± 22.0, P < 0.01). In
summary, mice with chronic overnutrition, as compared
with relatively insulin-sensitive short-term high-fat diet-
fed mice, not only demonstrate increased DNL but also
demonstrate an increase in the concentration of TCA
cycle intermediates, while hepatic amino acid concen-
trations are decreased.
Maintaining DNL in overnourished mice requires
the availability of multiple carbon sources
In 6-week high-fat fed mice, ASO treatment knocked
down target genes and proteins (Fig. 1). The GCK ASO
induced a 69% reduction in hepatic DNL, a 59%
reduction in liver TGs, and a 36% decrease in serum
TG, compared to the same ON mice treated with a
control ASO (Fig. 4). Similarly, LDHA ASO treatment
caused a 33% reduction in DNL and a 26% reduction in
hepatic TGs. Lastly, the ON mice treated with the GPT2
ASO demonstrated a 48% decrease in hepatic DNL, a
45% reduction in liver TGs, and a 23% decrease in
serum TGs. Therefore, in the setting of chronic over-
nutrition, where there are heightened rates of DNL,
glucose, lactate, and alanine are all essential to main-
taining heightened rates of hepatic lipogenesis.
Glucokinase knockdown attenuates lipogenesis to a
44% greater degree in ON mice than compared to the
GPT2 ASO. In conjunction with the decreased rates of
DNL observed multiple intrahepatic metabolites were
decreased in the ON GCK ASO-treated mice. There is a
significant decrease in hepatic alanine (57%), lactate
(43%), and citrate (39%), with a trending reduction in
hepatic glutamate (65%) (Fig. 5). There were no sig-
nificant alterations in these metabolites in any of the
other treatment groups (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Some effects of LDH ASO may be mediated by an
altered cytosolic redox state
Potential alterations to both mitochondrial and
cytosolic redox states were assessed by Beta-
hydroxybutyrate (βHB) to acetoacetate (AcAc) ratio
and lactate to pyruvate ratio, respectively. A slight in-
crease in lactate: pyruvate ratio was observed in MOE
control treated after 6 weeks of high-fat feeding,
compared to 3-day high-fat fed mice, although this was
not observed in GalNAc ASO treated mice. Further-
more, the LDHA ASO caused a significant reduction in
lactate: pyruvate ratio in 6-week high-fat fed mice
(Fig. 6). No significant differences were seen in the
mitochondrial redox state as measured byβHB: AcAc
ratio ( Supplemental Fig. 2 ). Thus, an increase in
reduced NADH (or NADPH) could help to account for
increased DNL in fat-fed mice, and a decrease in
reduced equivalents may contribute to the decrease in
DNL seen in LDHA ASO treated mice.
Carbon flux into citrate is increased with chronic
overnutrition and reduced with GCK ASO
In MOE ASO control mice relative carbon flux
through citrate synthase (CS) (P < 0.01), isocitrate de-
hydrogenase (IDH) (P < 0.05), and ATP-citrate lyase
(ACLY) (P < 0.05), as reflected by altered label distri-
bution within TCA cycle intermediates, are all signifi-
cantly increased in ON mice compared with CO mice
(Fig. 7). In GalNAc ASO control mice similar results are
observed with a significant increase in relative CS flux
(P < 0.05), and a trending increase in both IDH (P < 0.1)

and ACLY (P < 0.2) in ON compared with CO mice.
Furthermore, in ON mice, administration of the GCK
ASO significantly reduced relative IDH flux (P < 0.05),
and trending reductions in both CS (p∼0.05) and ACLY
(p∼0.2) flux were observed. In an internally consistent
manner, relative ACLY flux changes were reflected in
opposite relative changes in SDH fluxes (Supplemental
Fig. 3). Consistent with the DNL measurement experi-
ments, relative ACLY flux changes went in the same
direction as changes in DNL.
If the ASOs inadvertently altered peripheral prote-
olysis, this could explain some of the observed changes

Overnutrition fuels DNL by multiple substrates 5
in intrahepatic amino acid concentration and could
disproportionately influence carbon flux to DNL.
While this study was not designed to measure amino
acid turnover, turnover is inversely proportional to
enrichment of the infused isotope, so plasma m +5
enrichment was measured, and was unchanged
(Supplemental Fig. 4).
Molecular lipogenic programming is decreased with
GPT2 and LDHA ASOs but not GCK ASO
Both insulin and substrate can promote the tran-
scription of lipogenic machinery through SREBP-1c
and ChREBP, respectively. In CO mice, GPT2 ASO
administration significantly reduced the expression of
Chrebp β by 72% (P < 0.05) (Fig. 8). With the LDHA ASO,
a similar trend was observed in the expression ofChrebp
β (57%, P < 0.055), and a significant reduction was
observed in bothAcacb (44%, P < 0.05) and Fasn (46%,
P < 0.05) in CO mice. With the GCK ASO, these effects
on the molecular control of lipogenesis were not
observed in CO mice. In ON mice treated with the GCK
ASO, no significant changes were seen in the molecular
control of hepatic lipogenesis. However, in the setting
of ON, administration of either the GPT2 or LDHA
ASO induced significant reductions in Chrebp β
(GPT2: −63%, P < 0.05; LDHA: −69%, P < 0.01), Srebp1c
(GPT2: −74%, P < 0.05; LDHA: −86%, P < 0.01), Acacb
(GPT2: −74%, P < 0.05; LDHA: −90%, P < 0.001), and
Fasn (GPT2: −69%, P < 0.05; LDHA: −83%, P < 0.05).
Overall, the use of either the GPT2 or LDHA ASOs
reduced lipogenic gene expression, while the GCK ASO
did not significantly alter the molecular regulation of
hepatic lipogenesis.
DISCUSSION
Increased de novo lipogenesis contributes to lipid
disturbances prevalent in insulin-resistant subjects,
including dyslipidemia and MASLD; however, the
contributions of different lipogenic substrates to the
increase in DNL seen in the setting of insulin resistance
remains largely unexplored ( 4–6). To address these
questions, ASOs targeting glucokinase, lactate dehy-
drogenase, and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 were
utilized to restrict substrate influx from specific lipo-
genic precursors in both relatively insulin-sensitive
control mice, and 6-week high-fat diet-fed mice
(chronic overnutrition). Restriction of substrate supply
had markedly different effects on CO mice compared
to ON mice. Only with the restriction of alanine import
through GPT2 knockdown were there significantly
altered lipogenesis in CO mice, while all three ASOs
diminished lipogenesis in ON mice.
Glucose and fructose are major lipogenic substrates
(30, 31), and these carbohydrates can drive the lipogenic
transcriptional program. Insulin drives lipogenic gene
expression via SREBP-1c, and carbohydrate catabolism
can increase lipogenesis via activation of the tran-
scription factor ChREBP (7, 9, 13). Even though dietary
carbohydrates can drive lipogenesis, it has been posited
that neither dietary glucose nor fructose, are major
carbon sources for hepatic lipogenesis in healthy mice
(17, 32, 33). In this study, we probed this concept further
to demonstrate which substrates are the predominant
lipogenic carbon sources in differentially fat-fed mice.
Restricting glucose or lactate entry into hepatocyte
metabolism in CO mice only caused a slight, non-
significant, reduction in hepatic DNL. This is consistent
with prior literature suggesting diminished importance
of glucose carbon in lipogenesis (17, 32). However, the
GPT2 ASO did cause a robust reduction in both DNL
and hepatic triglyceride content— albeit still insignifi-
cant. Together, these findings support the idea that
amino acids, and not carbohydrates, provide the most
significant amount of lipogenic carbon in healthy mice.
Congruent with previous findings in both insulin-
resistant rodent models and insulin-resistant
humans, hepatic DNL is elevated in our mouse
model of high-fat-fed overnutrition (4, 5). In humans
with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance correlates

with an increase in circulating concentrations of
precursors of triglyceride biosynthesis ( 20), suggest-
ing carbon flux to the liver is a critical link between
whole-body insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.
In this study, the ON mice, compared with CO mice,
have significantly increased rates of lipogenesis. This
increase in DNL is supported by both an increase in
lipogenic gene expression and an increase in carbon
flux to citrate. Furthermore, restricting entry into
the pyruvate pool in ON mice from any carbon
source— lactate, alanine, or especially gluco-
se— resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic
DNL. Interestingly, the regulation of this decrease in
lipogenesis appears different between the GCK ASO
group and both the LDHA or GPT2 cohorts. The
observed increase in carbon flux to citrate in ON
mice is significantly diminished with GCK ASO
administration, but not significantly altered with
LDHA or GPT2 ASO administration. Whether these
insignificant changes to carbon flux in either LDHA
or GPT2 groups is due to unmodified carbon flux,
or whether there are differences below our ability to
detect, remains an open question.
In contrast, the elevated lipogenic gene expression
seen in ON mice is abrogated by the LDHA and GPT2
ASOs but is not altered by treatment with the GCK
ASO. A priori, we hypothesized that if any of the tested
ASOs would alter lipogenic gene expression, GCK ASO
would do so most prominently. Beyond its role as a
carbon source, carbohydrates can activate the tran-
scription of lipogenic machinery via ChREBP. It is
thought that glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), or another
intermediate metabolite of glucose catabolism, pro-
motes ChREBP activation ( 15, 34, 35). These results
suggest that the critical ChREBP-activating metabolite
is further downstream from glucose than glucose-6-
phosphate, such that we see an impact from partial
knockdown of LDHA and GPT2, but not GCK. While it
is difficult to explain the lack of an impact on ChREBP
expression in mice with reduced glucokinase, the
reduced lipogenic transcription factor pattern seen in
the LDHA ASO and GPT2 ASO could potentially be
explained by alterations in substrate-responsive AMPK,
cholesterol-regulated LXR, or redox-regulated Sirt6
(36–40). Further studies are required to interrogate
these mechanisms.

Together these data suggest a greater role for altered
lipogenic carbon flux in the attenuation of DNL due to
GCK ASO administration, whereas molecular regula-
tion of lipogenic program has a greater role in the
attenuation of DNL due to LDHA and GPT2 ASO
administration. Furthermore, the reversal of the pro-
lipogenic redox state of ON mice by the LDHA ASO
may also help to explain the effect of this ASO. While
the mechanism of action may be different between
ASOs, reducing carbon from glucose, lactate, or alanine
all decrease the heightened rates of DNL observed in
ON mice. Notably, the alterations to carbon flux are not
an artifactual effect of the ASOs on rates of peripheral
proteolysis.
As noted above, it has been posited that glucose is not
a major carbon source for hepatic lipogenesis (17). Our
data is consistent with this observation, as restricting
glucose entry into glycolysis did not limit DNL in the
CO mice. Of note, prior studies interrogating the reli-
ance on glucose to support hepatic lipogenesis have
been performed in insulin-sensitive mice (17, 32), leav-
ing open the critical question of whether glucose is
important for the stimulation of DNL seen in insulin-
resistant animals. Interestingly, data from the present
study supports the idea that hepatic glucose entry is
essential to maintaining hepatic DNL in the setting of
overnutrition. Extrapolating from studies of the role of
glucose in insulin-sensitive mice to the insulin-resistant
condition may have created discordant or even incor-
rect conclusions in the past. The results presented here
are consistent with a significantly different role for
glucose in DNL in CO versus ON mice. While restrict-
ing hepatocyte glucose entry with the glucokinase ASO
in CO mice had minimal effect on DNL, restricting
glucose to ON livers dramatically disrupted DNL.
Glycolysis appears replaceable for maintenance of
DNL in the CO mouse, while it is indispensable in the
ON mouse.
Not only does glucose appear to play a role in DNL
in ON mice that it does not in relatively insulin-
sensitive mice, but hepatic glucose input into DNL in
ON mice is particularly important. The GPT2 ASO,
which was the only ASO to attenuate lipogenesis (by a
nearly-significant trend) in CO mice, decreased DNL

by 48% in ON mice. In contrast, while the GCK ASO
did not have a significant impact on DNL in CO mice,
it markedly knocked down DNL in ON mice (by 69%).
The ON GCK ASO-treated mice also demonstrated
significant reductions in hepatic concentrations of
many alternative substrates (eg alanine and lactate),
reflecting the impact of reduced glucose metabolism
on other carbon sources for DNL. In the setting of
overnutrition, carbohydrate use by the hepatocyte
appears to be essential for maintaining elevated rates
of hepatic lipogenesis. This study demonstrates that
carbohydrate, and lipogenic substrate in general, can
drive DNL in addition to the well-described effects of
carbohydrate on the transcription of lipogenic
enzymes.

This study has some limitations that should be
acknowledged. For this investigation, we chose to eval-
uate only three ASOs, even though many enzymes are
critical to substrate availability for DNL. However,
in vivo lipogenic flux measurements are quite variable,
so performing a screening study testing all anaplerotic
and glycolytic enzymes would be impractical in com-
bination with stable isotope measurements of DNL.
However, in this study, using only three ASO targets, we
were able to clearly demonstrate the important effect
of individual lipogenic substrates on DNL. A second
concern is regarding the bidirectional nature of some
metabolic enzymes. Both LDHA and GPT2 can regulate
flux both into and away from mitochondrial pyruvate.
This enzymatic bidirectionality has the potential to
confound some of the interpretation of the results
from these experiments.
Furthermore, as with any dietary intervention, the
composition of the diet and the substrates provided can
influence hepatic metabolism and carbon flux. While a
60% high-fat diet does not mimic the nutrient compo-
sition of American high-calorie diets (∼36% calories
from fat, CDC National Center for Health Statistics),
and laboratory rodents don’t mimic the genetic varia-
tion in human patients, results from HFD-fed rodents
studies have been remarkably translatable to human
insulin resistance. Bioactive lipid paradigms for insulin
resistance, such as the diacylglycerol and ceramide
models of insulin resistance, are consistently repro-
ducible in human studies (41, 42).
For this study, we used 3-day high-fat fed mice as a
control cohort compared to the 6-week high-fat fed
mice. This allows the mice to be matched in terms of
substrate, which is critical for direct comparisons of
DNL between the groups. We have previously shown
that this comparison is reasonable when considering
the important parameter of insulin resistance: a short-
term high-fat diet/dextrose water-fed model is rela-
tively insulin sensitive as compared with longer-term
fat-fed mice (23). However, we cannot rule out that a

more insulin-sensitive model might route its carbon
fluxes to DNL in a meaningfully different way— for
example, increased beta-oxidation with a high-fat diet
will alter the mitochondrial acyl CoA profile, which
directly impacts multiple TCA cycle-adjacent fluxes.
Furthermore, when measuring lipogenesis on a high-
fat diet, a source of lipogenic substrate is required to
get robust, interpretable results. The decision to use
carbohydrates in the drinking water certainly amplified
the importance of glucokinase in this study; however,
the addition of sugar to the diet was necessary to
elevate levels of lipogenesis to levels where differences
could be detected between cohorts. This dietary con-
dition also better reflected a ‘Western diet’— high in
both fat and sugar. Furthermore, in the overnourished
cohort, the knockdown of any gene involved in the

entry of carbon into pyruvate led to a decrease in DNL.
Thus, if we had chosen another lipogenic carbon source
in this study (eg alanine), we would expect a similar
result (although a result that may amplify the impor-
tance of the other chosen lipogenic substrate). While
one might propose to study a battery of diets to better
understand the discrete roles of each lipogenic sub-
strate, our study design, using a single diet, allowed for
a more straightforward comparison between experi-
mental groups.
Finally, in this study, we utilized a uniformly labeled
glutamine tracer to assess relative carbon flux, as well
as measure rates of peripheral proteolysis. In future
studies, alternative tracer methods, such as developing a
new method to follow amino acid carbons into fatty
acids, could be employed to better evaluate the fate of
specific carbon sources into fatty acids. Still, the data
presented in this study uncovers how substrate flux
from different precursors is incorporated into fatty
acids.
In conclusion, DNL in mice is dependent on all sub-
strate fluxes to the liver. However, while some flexi-
bility exists in the more insulin-sensitive condition, in
the overnourished whole-body insulin-resistant condi-
tion the reliance of hepatic lipogenesis on specific
substrates is dramatically altered and the elevated rates
of hepatic DNL are markedly attenuated when entry of
any lipogenic metabolite is restricted. These findings
may inform the development of novel therapies and
underscore the importance of the interplay between
peripheral substrate metabolism (uptake, production,
and oxidation) and the liver in the regulation of hepatic
lipogenesis, impacting on both the development of and
prevention of fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia in the
metabolic syndrome.
