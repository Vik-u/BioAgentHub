ABSTRACT  
We report a stereospecific imine reductase from Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 (CpIM1), a versatile biocatalyst 
and a rich source of highly stereospecific oxidoreductases. The recombinant gene was overexpressed in Escher -
ichia coli and the protein CpIM1 was purified to homogeneity. This protein belongs to the Ornithine cyclo -
deaminase/ μ -crystallin (OCD-Mu) family of proteins which has only a few characterized members. CpIM1 
catalyzed the alkylamination of α -keto acids/esters producing exclusively ( S )- N -alkyl amino acids/esters e.g. N- 
methyl- L -alanine with > 90% conversion and > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The enzyme showed the highest 
activity for the alkylamination of pyruvate and methylamine leading to N- methyl- L -alanine with an apparent K
M 
of 15.04 ± 2.8 mM and V
max 
of 13.75 ± 1.07 μ mol/min/mg. CpIM1 also catalyzed (i) the reduction of imines e.g. 
2-methyl-1-pyrroline to ( S )-2-methylpyrrolidine with ~30% conversion and 75% ee and (ii) the dehydrogenation 
of cyclic amino acids e.g. L -Proline (as monitered by reduction of cofactor NADP
+
spectrophotometrically).   
1. Introduction 
Chiral amines are essential functional groups in many bioactive 
molecules, and ~40% of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 20% of 
agrochemicals contain one or more chiral amine moieties [1] . The 
synthesis of these bioactive molecules in their optically pure form 
traditionally involves heavy metal catalysts, reagents, solvents that pose 
environmental problems and the extensive use of protecting groups. 
Thus, reducing the efficiency of modern manufacturing processes. 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop improved environmentally benign 
methods. For these reasons, importance of biocatalysts, which are ste -
reo-, regio-and chemo-selective, requiring mild operating conditions 
and water as the solvent, is ever-increasing [2 – 4] . 
The last decade saw several reports for the biocatalytic synthesis of 
chiral amines, including resolution of racemic amines using lipases and 
monoamine oxidases, asymmetric synthesis using transaminases, imine 
reductases, and amine dehydrogenases [5 – 9] . Enzymatic imine reduc -
tion is the most promising approach since the single-step asymmetric 
reduction of prochiral imines to the corresponding amines can theoret -
ically yield 100% of the required enantiomer. Further, the reduction of 
imines generated in situ by the condensation of amines and carbonyl 
compounds can be used to synthesize almost any primary, secondary, or 
tertiary amine [1] . Enzymes of several structurally unrelated protein 
families catalyze the reduction of C = N bonds in pathways responsible 
for the synthesis of folate, alkaloids, siderophores, and antibiotics; 
however, many of these enzymes have been studied only for their 
physiological and biomedical relevance [1] . 
Two enantio-complementary NADPH-dependent imine reductases 
(IREDs), that natively reduced 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2-MPN) from 
Streptomyces spp. by were first reported by Mitsukura et al ., [10 – 12] . The 
application of these enzymes in the asymmetric reduction of a variety of 
cyclic imines, iminium ions, and biocatalytic cascades has generated 
interest in IREDs as catalysts for the synthesis of chiral amines. Several 
research groups worldwide have screened and characterized numerous 
IRED homologs [13 – 19] but successfully isolated only a few IRED ho -
mologs that are capable of reductive amination of carbonyl substrates 
with amines [19 – 21] . In addition to IREDs ketimine reductases (KIREDs) 
and Δ 1-piperidine-2-carboxylate/ Δ 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate re -
ductases (PipC/PyrC REDs) reportedly reduce several naturally occur -
ring cyclic imino-acids [22] . Some amine dehydrogenases are known to 
catalyze reductive amination of ketones with ammonia [23] . At the 
same time, proteins like L -amino acid dehydrogenases and opine de -
hydrogenases (which natively couple α -amino acids with α -keto acids) 
have been engineered to broaden the substrate scope to improve their

utility in chiral amine synthesis [24 – 26] . 
The present study reports the isolation and characterization of a 
stereospecific imine reductase CpIM1 from Candida parapsilosis ATCC 
7330, a rich source of oxidoreductases [27 – 29] . Imine reducing activ -
ities of various yeasts are known, and our earlier work on Candida par -
apsilosis ATCC 7330 reported the reduction of aryl imines using whole 
cells of this yeast [ 6 , 30 ]. Notably, no imine reductases from yeasts have 
yet been characterized, and only recently ene-reductases from Saccha -
romyces spp. have been reported to reduce C = N group of oximes pro -
miscuously [31] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a 
purified and characterized imine reductase from yeast. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Gene cloning 
The genomic DNA of Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 was isolated 
from liquid culture using the lithium acetate (LiOAc)-SDS method [32] . 
Briefly, 1 ml of culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resus -
pended in 100 mM lithium acetate, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(LiOAc-SDS) solution to lyse the cells. Subsequently, DNA was precipi -
tated by adding three parts of ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 
18000 g. The obtained pellet was resuspended in 100 µ l of ultrapure 
water and again centrifuged, and the supernatant transferred to a fresh 
centrifuge tube and stored at -20 
◦
C. 
The isolated genomic DNA was used as a template for amplifying the 
Candida parapsilosis imine reductase gene (CpIM1) using the primers: 
Im1_F CATATG AAGGTCATTAGAGATAAAGAT (Nde1) 
Im1_R GAATTC AAATTTGGTCTAAAAGTCAT (EcoR1) 
The amplified product was purified from agarose gel and ligated into 
pGEMT vector by TA cloning. The resulting construct, pGEMT-IM1, was 
transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 α for bulk production of the cir -
cular plasmid. The plasmid pGEMT-IM1 was isolated from respective 
transformed colonies of E. coli DH5 α and subjected to digestion by Nde 1 
and Eco R1. The insert obtained was ligated into expression vector 
pET28a by directional cloning. 
2.2. Protein expression and purification 
After the pET28a-IM1 construct was verified by sequencing, E. coli 
BL21 (DE3) was transformed by the plasmid pET28a-IM1. The success -
fully transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pET28a-IM1 
construct were grown in Lysogeny broth to 0.6 – 0.8 OD
600 
at 37 
◦
C. 
Then 1 mM isopropyl β - D -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 
induce the expression of recombinant CpIM1 at 23 
◦
C incubated for 18 h. 
The induced cells were harvested and stored at -80 
◦
C until further use. 
The purification of overexpressed CpIM1 was carried out by metal 
affinity chromatography on GE Ӓ KTA fast protein liquid chromatog -
raphy system (GE Biosciences), installed inside a cold cabinet. All the 
purification steps were carried out at 4 
◦
C or on ice. The E. coli BL21 
(DE3) cells containing overexpressed CpIM1 were resuspended in a 
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, and 4 mM 
benzamidine hydrochloride, and lyzed using ultrasonic cell disruptor 
(SONICS Vibracell VCX130) set at 60% amplitude for 2 min (1 second 
on, 2 s off). After ultra-sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 15000 g 
to separate cell debris and was loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (5 ml, 
GE Biosciences). The bound recombinant protein was washed with 50 
mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 30 mM imidazole and eluted with 
50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. This 
protein solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded on to 
HiTrap Desalting column (5ml, GE Biosciences) to desalt and change the 
buffer as required. The purified protein samples were routinely quanti -
fied by the Bradford method and analyzed by SDS – PAGE, followed by 
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. 
2.3. Analytical gel filtration 
Analytical gel filtration was performed on a fast protein liquid 
chromatography (FPLC) system ( Ӓ KTA purifier, GE Biosciences) with a 
column manually packed with GE Sephacryl G200 resin, the mobile 
phase with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl. 
Protein standards used were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. 
2.4. Comparison of primary and secondary structure 
BlastP was used to identify proteins that are similar in sequence to 
CpIM1 [33] . Multiple sequence alignment was constructed using 
PSI/TM-Coffee [34] . CpIM1 was modeled with ROBETTA protein 
structure prediction server, and structural comparisons were made using 
TM-align [ 35 , 36 ]. 
2.5. Determination of enzyme activity 
The imine reduction/alkylamination activity of the enzyme was 
determined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance of the cofactor 
NAD(P)H at 340 nm using UV visible spectrophotometer (JASCO) at 
25 
◦
C. The assay mixture contained an appropriate amount of the pro -
tein, 1 – 4 mM of the imine substrate, and 0.2 mM of NAD(P)H in 50 mM 
Tris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5. For reductive amination with substrates, the 
assay mixture consisted of an appropriate amount of the protein, 1 – 10 
mM of the α -ketoacid/ketoester, 1 – 100 mM amine substrate, and 0.2 
mM of NADPH in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5. One unit of the enzyme 
activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidized 1 μ mol of 
NADPH per minute at the specified assay conditions. For measuring the 
oxidative activity, 10 mM of oxidized cofactor NADP
+
was used at pH 
10.5, and the increase in absorbance at 340 nm monitored. When 
necessary, the substrate stocks were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) and added to the reaction mixture such that the final DMSO 
concentration was 5% (v/v). 
2.6. Determination of pH optima 
The pH optima of CpIM1 were determined for using sodium pyruvate 
and methylamine in case of alkylamination and 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2- 
MPN) for imine reduction. Thus, the assay mixture contained an 
appropriate amount of the protein, 10 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 mM 
methylamine/4 mM 2-MPN, and 0.2 mM of NAD(P)H in buffers at 
various pH. 
2.7. Kinetics with sodium pyruvate and methylamine as substrates 
The kinetic parameters (K
M 
and V
max
) of CpIM1 were determined 
using sodium pyruvate and methylamine as substrates. Since the enzyme 
has three substrates, i.e., sodium pyruvate, methylamine, and NADPH, 
the apparent V
max 
and K
M 
were calculated by measuring activities on 
varying concentrations of one substrate with fixed non-limiting con -
centrations of the other two substrates. Non-limiting concentrations of 
0.2 mM for NADPH, 50 mM for methylamine, and 10 mM for sodium 
pyruvate were used to invoke pseudo-first-order kinetics. Thus, the assay 
mixture consisted of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), an appropriate amount 
of the protein, 0.1 – 50 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 – 50 mM methylamine, 
and 0.2 mM of NADPH. All measurements were carried out in triplicates. 
2.8. Enzymatic biotransformations and analysis of the reaction product 
Enzymatic biotransformations were carried out in 1 ml scale to 
confirm the formation of the product. For alkylamination reactions, the 
reaction mixture consisted of 5 – 10 mM of α -ketoacid, 50 – 100 mM amine 
substrate, and 12 – 15 mM of NADPH in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 
7.5 – 8.5. For imine reduction, the reaction mixture consisted of 4 mM of 
the substrate, 6 mM NAD(P)H in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5 – 8.5.

When necessary, the substrate stocks were prepared in DMSO and added 
to the reaction mixture such that the final DMSO concentration was 5% 
(v/v). After three-hour incubation at 25 ˚ C, the reaction was stopped by 
adding a one-tenth volume of 10 N sodium hydroxide and further 
derivatized/extracted (supplementary section) to be analyzed by Gas 
Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Shimadzu QP2010). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Identification of candidate gene 
The whole cells of Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 catalyze the 
asymmetric reduction of prochiral imines to chiral amines as reported 
[6] . This implies the presence of stereospecific imine reductase(s) in this 
yeast. The preliminary investigation revealed that no gene from Candida 
parapsilosis showed significant sequence similarity to IRED sequences 
from Streptomyces spp. or any other IRED homologs which have been 
reported [10 – 19] . The CpIM1 gene was identified using a human Mu 
crystallin (CRYM) gene sequence as a template, which is reportedly a 
ketimine reductase that catalyzes the alkylamination of various 
keto-acids [37] . CpIM1 showed a 24.5% identity with the human CRYM 
gene and belonged to the ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD-Mu) family of 
proteins. The OCD-Mu protein family consists of oxidoreductases acting 
on carbon-nitrogen bonds, which are widely distributed and contain 
proteins with diverse functions. Mammalian KIREDs, plant and archaeal 
PipC/PyrC REDs reduce cyclic imino acids, some of which have been 
explored for the biocatalytic synthesis of chiral N -alkyl amino acids [ 22 , 
37 – 39 ]. Cyclodeaminases from several gram-negative bacteria catalyze 
concerted oxidative-deamination cyclization and reduction of ornithi -
ne/lysine [40 – 42] . The other members of the OCD-Mu protein family 
include opine dehydrogenases from marine sponges, N -((2 S )-2-ami -
no-2-carboxyethyl)- L -glutamate dehydrogenase (ACEGA) from Staphy -
lococcus aureus , alanine dehydrogenase (Adh) from archaeon 
Archaeoglobus fulgidus and iminosuccinate reductase from Paracoccus 
denitrificans [43 – 47] . It is also true that only a few members of this 
protein family have been characterized beyond gene annotation, making 
it an interesting and important area to explore and understand. 
3.2. Analysis of the primary structure 
As the first step towards the investigation of imine reductases from 
this yeast, well-characterized homologs of CpIM1 were identified using 
BlastP [33] . Multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree were 
then constructed using PSI/TM-Coffee [34] ( Fig. 1 , Supplementary 
Figures S1 and S2). The present study revealed that among the charac -
terized members of the OCD family, CpIM1 was closest to plant OCD 
homologs ( Arabidopsis thaliana and Huperzia serrata ), followed by 
Human CRYM and other mammalian OCD homologs (Supplementary 
Fig. S2). The conserved motif GXGXXA/G/S (marked by the box in 
Fig. 1 ) is present in CpIM1 and the other OCD/ μ -crystallin family 
members, indicating the presence of the Rossmann fold for cofactor 
binding [48] . The mechanism and role of residues lining the active 
pocket in the OCD-Mu family is studied in detail in Streptomyces pristi -
naespiralis L -Lysine cyclodeaminase (SpLCD) [41] and Pseudomonas

putida ornithine cyclodeaminase (PpOCD) [42] . Among these residues 
Arg48, Met65, Lys76, and Arg118 are conserved in CpIM1 (marked by 
an arrow in Fig. 1 ) and most other OCD-Mu homologs. The residues 
Lys76 and Arg118 interact directly with the carboxyl group of the sub -
strate while Arg48 is thought to form hydrogen bonds with the substrate 
and the water molecule that transfers a proton during imine reduction. 
The exact role of Met65 is not understood, although it is conserved in 
most OCD-Mu proteins. The residues Glu56 (Glu63) and Asp228 
(Asp236) from SpLCD (PpOCD), which are considered critical for 
cyclodeaminase activity are not conserved in CpIM1, plant and 
mammalian OCD homologs. Instead, the position occupied by Asp228 in 
SpLCD is occupied by serine in all the mammalian OCD homologs which 
is also suitably positioned to act as a proton donor [22] . In CpIM1, this 
position is occupied by bulky tyrosine, marked by the blue arrow in 
Fig. 1 . 
3.3. Protein overexpression and purification 
The CpIM1 gene was amplified using the genomic DNA of Candida 
parapsilosis ATCC 7330 as the template and was cloned into the pET28a 
vector system overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The His6-tagged 
CpIM1 was purified by metal affinity chromatography and showed a 
molecular weight of 42 kDa on SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2 a) in agreement with its 
theoretical value (351 aa). This is slightly higher than other known 
members of OCD-Mu family proteins (CRYM Homo sapiens 313 aa, 
Alanine dehydrogenase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus 322 aa, and orni -
thine cyclodeaminase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 310 aa) [ 37 , 42 , 46 ]. 
Like other members of the OCD-Mu family proteins, CpIM1 was found to 
exist as a homodimer as confirmed by analytical gel filtration ( Fig. 2 b). 
3.4. Effect of pH on enzyme activity 
The enzyme showed maximum activity in the pH range of 6.8 – 9.0 for 
alkylamination of sodium pyruvate with methylamine ( Fig. 3 a). There 
was a sharp decrease in activity on either side of this pH zone. In a 
similar study that was carried out using 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2-MPN), a 
cyclic imine, which was stable in an aqueous medium around neutral 
pH, the enzyme showed activity over a broader pH range of 5-9 ( Fig. 3 b). 
The human KIRED, which has a pH optimum of 5 for reduction of cyclic 
imino-acids [49] , showed better conversion for alkylaminations of 
α -ketoacids at pH 8.5 [22] . Since the alkylamination proceeds by the 
formation of an imine intermediate, the nucleophilic attack by methyl -
amine on the carbonyl carbon of α -ketoacids is favourable at pH near the 
pKa of the amine (~10 in case of methylamine). In essence, alkylami -
nation is favoured at basic pH. 
The oxidation of proline was preferred towards basic pH with the

observed specific activity at pH 10.5 being greater than at pH 9. 
3.5. Substrate scope and enantiospecificity 
CpIM1 catalyzed alkylamination of various α -ketoacid/ketoesters 
( Table 1 ). Among the reactions studied, the highest activity is seen for 
sodium pyruvate with methylamine (amine) in the presence of NADPH 
as a cofactor, resulting in the formation of N -methyl alanine (Supple -
mentary Figure S4). This reaction exclusively produced N- methyl- L - 
alanine, which is the ( S ) enantiomer ( > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee), 
Supplementary Figure S5) of the product as confirmed by GC-MS after 
derivatizing with a chiral reagent ( R )-menthyl chloroformate (Supple -
mentary scheme S3). The mammalian KIREDs and Thermococcus litoralis 
OCD are also known for alkyl-amination of various α -ketoacid/ketoest -
ers and produce L -amino acids [ 22 , 37 , 39 ]. While CpIM1 and mamma -
lian KIREDs use NADPH [ 22 , 37 ], Thermococcus litoralis OCD is known to 
utilize NADH as cofactor [39] . CpIM1 also catalyzed similar reactions 
with ethylamine and ammonium chloride producing N -ethyl alanine 
(Supplementary Fig. S8) and L -alanine (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). 
The specific activities were 20 and 100-fold less, respectively, compared 
to that of methylamine ( Table 1: entries 2 and 3). The human KIRED 
reportedly shows comparable activities for both, methylamine and 
ethylamine [37] . The archaeal members of the family Archaeoglobus 
fulgidus Adh and Thermococcus litoralis OCD show significantly higher 
activity with ammonia/ammonium chloride as the amine substrate [ 39 , 
50 ]. CpIM1 did not show any alkyl-amination activity of sodium pyru -
vate with dimethylamine, benzylamine, and hydroxylamine, while 
several mammalian KIREDs are known to show activity with benzyl -
amine [22] . CpIM1 also displayed good activity with ethyl pyruvate and 
methylamine ( Table 1: entry 4). It did not show any significant activity 
with phenylpyruvic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid (with methylamine) 
when assayed at pH 7.5; however, on incubation with excess of enzyme 
at pH 8.5, the formation of corresponding N -methyl α -amino acids was 
observed as analyzed by GC-MS (Supplementary Figs. S9,10). The 
human CRYM and other mammalian OCD homologs show moderate 
activity with phenylpyruvate and methylamine (compared with

pyruvate and methylamine) [ 22 , 37 ]. The poor activity of CpIM1 with 
phenylpyruvic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid may be due to the presence 
of bulky tyrosine residue instead of serine (in mammalian KIREDs), 
which projects into the active site [22] . Alkylamination of ethyl 
2-oxo-4-phenyl butanoate [a keto-ester] with methylamine was cata -
lyzed by CpIM1 with a considerable activity of 1760 mU ( Table 1: entry 
7), implying that two carbon length separation between the ketoacid 
moiety and the phenyl ring allowed proper binding of the substrate. The 
formation of the product was confirmed by GC-MS (Supplementary 
Fig. S12,13). CpIM1 also showed formation of product ethyl sarcosinate 
with ethyl glyoxylate and methylamine (Supplementary Figure S11). 
The direct alkylamination of α -keto-esters by a member of of OCD-Mu 
family is reported here for the first time. 
In addition to alkylamination, CpIM1 catalyzed imine reduction with 
cyclic imine 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2MPN) and aromatic imine N -ben -
zylideneaniline ( Table 2: entries 1-2), albeit with very low activity when 
compared to that observed for alkylamination of sodium pyruvate and 
methylamine. The specific activity observed for the reduction of 2- 
methyl-1-pyrroline 44 ± 2 mU/mg is comparable to some of the re -
ported IREDs, e.g., 50 ± 20 mU/mg from Streptomyces sp. 3456 [12] , 66 
mU/mg from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and 20 mU/mg from Paeni -
bacillus elgii B69 [13] . Interestingly, reduction of 2MPN occurred spe -
cifically with NADH producing ( S )-2-methylpyrrolidine (75% ee, 
Supplementary Figure S16). Inhibition was observed at concentrations 
above 5 mM of 2MPN. The reduction of N -benzylideneaniline occurred 
with NADH and NADPH. The formation of products with 2MPN and 
N -benzylidene aniline was confirmed by GC-MS by comparison with 
authentic product standards (Supplementary Figs. S15 and S17). The 
switching of cofactor specificity has also been observed in the case of 
porcine and bovine KIREDs with specific substrates [49] . Although, 
CpIM1 showed some activity with N -(1-phenylethylidene) benzenamine 
(52 mU/mg), the conversion was not significant (Supplementary 
Figs. S18). 
CpIM1 also catalyzed the dehydrogenation of L -proline and 4-hy -
droxy- L -proline in the basic pH range of 9.0 – 10.5. With L -proline as 
substrate, CpIM1 showed the highest activity of 420 mU/mg at pH 10.5 
( Table 2: entry 3), while activity with 4-hydroxy- L -proline was about 
100-fold less and was barely detectable under the assay conditions. 
However, this reaction required higher concentrations of cofactor 
NADP
+
(1 mM) for appreciable rates unlike reductions, which required 
only 0.2 mM of reduced cofactor NADPH. CpIM1 did not show any ac -
tivity with D -proline when assayed under identical conditions. Interest -
ingly, quite like human KIRED, CpIM1 did not show oxidation of N - 
methyl- L -alanine (the product from methylamination of sodium pyru -
vate) under any of the tested conditions. 
3.6. Steady-state kinetic parameters 
Since the enzyme has the highest specific activity for methylamina -
tion of sodium pyruvate, which involves three substrates, i.e., sodium 
pyruvate, methylamine, and NADPH, two sets of experiments were 
carried to for determination of kinetic parameters to invoke pseudo-first- 
order kinetics: (i) concentration of pyruvate was varied with non- 
limiting concentrations of the other two substrates (0.2 mM for 
NADPH, 50 mM for methylamine) (ii) concentration of methylamine 
was varied with fixed concentration of pyruvate (10 mM) and NADPH 
(0.2 mM). CpIM1 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the first set of 
experiments with pyruvate as a substrate with an apparent K
M 
of 15.04 
± 2.8 mM and V
max 
of 13.75 ± 1.07 μ mol/min/mg ( Fig. 4 a). In the 
second set of experiments, the determination of K
M 
and V
max 
with 
methylamine was inconclusive since the rate of reaction did not saturate 
even with 50 mM of methylamine, and further addition of methylamine 
led to a drastic increase in pH ( Fig. 4 b). Human KIRED is reported to 
behave similarly [37] . The apparent K
M 
observed for CpIM1 was higher 
than that of human CRYM (2.9 ± 0.3 mM) [37] but comparable to that of 
N -Methylalanine dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas MS ATCC 25262 
(K
M 
of 15 mM) [51] , which is structurally unrelated but catalyzes the 
same reaction. However, V
max 
of CpIM1 is higher than values reported 
for both human CRYM (2 ± 0.3 μ mol/min/mg) and N -Methylalanine 
dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas MS ATCC 25262 (0.37 
μ mol/min/mg) [ 37 , 51 ]. Two other enzymes, which are structurally 
unrelated to CpIM1, PipC/PyrC reductases from P. putida [52] , and 
P. syringae [53] , have higher specific activities (42 μ mol/min/mg and 
140 μ mol/min/mg) for the same reaction.

Despite the high observed K
M
, the biotransformations with sodium 
pyruvate and methylamine proceeded to completion, making it very 
apparent that imine intermediate is the actual substrate for the enzy -
matic reduction. Since apparent saturation was observed with pyruvate 
but not with methylamine, it can be concluded that the enzyme has 
binding site for pyruvate. This is supported by the crystal structure of 
mouse KIRED (4BV9), which has pyruvate in the active site [54] . Thus, 
imine formation can occur within the active site by the action of 
methylamine on the enzyme-bound pyruvate. 
4. Conclusion 
A novel imine reductase gene CpIM1 isolated, cloned, and overex -
pressed from the versatile biocatalyst Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 is 
reported. Its biochemical properties and the substrate scope and enan -
tiospecificity of the purified CpIM1 were explored. CpIM1 catalyzed 
alkylamination of α -ketoacids and α -ketoesters producing ( S )-alkyl 
amino acids/esters, which are essential building blocks for the phar -
maceutical agents, especially the emerging peptide drugs. It also 
inherently reduced several imines to corresponding amines and cata -
lyzed dehydrogenation of cyclic amino acids. The enzyme seemed to 
prefer substrates with a carboxylic acid moiety and would make an 
attractive candidate for directed evolution to accept ketones as sub -
strates. Further mutational and crystallographic studies will not only 
provide insights into the structure and mechanism of CpIM1 but also aid 
in understanding the structure-function relationship in the OCD-Mu 
protein family.
