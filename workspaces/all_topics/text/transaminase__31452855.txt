Transaminases (TAs) reversibly catalyze the transfer reaction of an amino group between an amino group donor
and an amino group acceptor, using pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. TAs are categorized according to
the amino group position of the donor substrate and respective TAs recognize their own speciﬁc substrates. Over
the past decade, a number of TA structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography. On the basis of the
structural information, the detailed mechanism of substrate recognition by TAs has also been elucidated. In
this review, fold type I TAs are addressed intensively. Comparative studies on structural differences between
the apo and holo forms of fold type I TAs have demonstrated that regions containing the active site exhibit struc-
tural plasticity in the apo form, facilitating PLP insertion into the active site. In addition, given that TAs recognize
two different kinds of substrates, they possess dual substrate speciﬁcity. It is known that spatial rearrangements
of active site residues occur upon binding of the substrates. Intriguingly, positively charged residues are predom-
inantly distributed at the active site cavity. The electricﬁeld generated by such charge distributions may attract
negatively charged molecules, such as PLP and amino group acceptors, into the active site. Indeed, TAs show re-
markable dynamics in diverse aspects. In this review, we describe the comprehensive working mechanism of fold
type I TAs, with a focus on conformational changes.

enzymatic properties and industrial applicability [1–4]. TAs catalyze the
reversible transfer reaction of an amino group between two compounds
[1]. For catalysis, amino acids and amines devoid of a carboxylic acid
group constitute amino group donors, whereas ketones, keto acids,
and aldehydes act as amino group acceptors. This“ping-pong” reaction
is mediated by the cofactor, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), which is lo-
cated at the active site. Thus, TAs recognize two disparate compounds
as their substrates at the same active site.
TAs can be classiﬁed according to the amino group position of their
donor substrates (α, β, γ,o rω)[ 5,6]. TAs recognizing an amino group
bound toα, β,o rγ carbon atoms are calledα, β,a n dγTAs, respectively.
ωTA is the common name of the TAs that recognize an amino group
bound to non-α carbon in the donor substrate [5,6]. TAs also have the
ability to distinguish betweenR-a n dS-enantiomers, signifying that
the substrates are precisely recognized at the active site [7–10]. On ac-
count of such enzymatic diversity and speciﬁcity, TAs have been utilized
as biocatalysts to produce useful compounds inﬁne chemical and phar-
maceutical industries [3,11,12]. TAs, especiallyωTAs, have been applied
industrially for both kinetic resolution and asymmetric synthesis of key
compounds [11]. To attain kinetic resolution, undesired amine enantio-
mers occupying half of racemic compounds are converted to ketone
products, leaving only desired enantiomers in the initial racemic form
[11]. However, for asymmetric synthesis, an amino group is transferred
mainly to ketone compounds selected as precursors, yielding target chi-
ral amines [11].
PLP is a vital molecule directly involved in both the acceptance and
donation of an amino group. The transamination reaction occurs
through two sequential half reactions via PLP: 1) the oxidative deami-
nation of an amino group donor and 2) the reductive amination of an
amino group acceptor [4,13,14].
PLP is associated with both reactions,
as a mediator of the amino group. The transamination reaction is trig-
gered by exchanging the amino group from the donor substrate with
the ε-amino group of an adjacent Lys residue covalently bound to the
C4′ atom on PLP, thus converting PLP to pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate
(PMP). Subsequently, the amino group of PMP is transferred to the ac-
ceptor substrate, yielding a new amine or amino acid. In addition to its
role as a catalysis mediator, PLP also constitutes a spatial criterion for
the compartmentalization of the active site pocket. Previous structural
studies have shown that the active site of TAs is composed of two
pockets, the P- and O-pockets [3,6,15]. As indicated by their names,
the P-pocket is positioned near the phosphate group of PLP, and the
O-pocket is formed in the vicinity of the O3′ atom of PLP. The respective
pockets exhibit diversity in terms of size and hydrophobicity depending
on the type of TAs [3,14]. Hence, PLP constitutes a key molecule, with a
profound impact on the structure and function of TAs.
To date, a number of TA, mainly fold type I TA structures have been
determined by X-ray crystallography. Numerous structures ofαTAs
such as aspartate aminotransferases have been reported and their
mechanisms have been discussed [16–22]. SuchαTAs mainly recognize
α-amino acids andα-keto acids as their substrates. However,ωTAs rec-
ognize a wider range of substrates, compared withαTAs [16–22]. βTAs
also have enzymatic activity towardβ-amino acids, which are rare com-
pounds in nature. In this review, thus, we deal with non-αTAs, namely
ωTAs including aβTA. Although most of TA structures are holo forms
containing PLP, a small number of apo forms have also been described.
In ωTAs from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ωTA) [23]a n dVibrio
ﬂuvialis (Vf-ωTA) [24,25], both the apo and holo forms have been re-
ported and their structural differences characterized. Apo [26]a n d
holo [27] forms of aβTA
from Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK (Ms-βTA)
have also been reported. As such, comparative studies encompassing a
wide range of TA structures, provide valuable information on structural
differences between TA types, which allows us to infer structural
dynamics.
Herein, we review previous studies on the conformational changes
of fold type I TAs, with a particular focus on the effect of PLP and the sub-
strate on the structural stability of TAs. In addition, we will address a
recent issue regarding how surface electrostatic potential contributes
to substrate induction into the active site of TAs, by assessing electro-
static properties. Thus, this review provides novel insights into not
only the structural dynamics of TAs to adopt adequate conformations
in accordance with environmental changes, but also the transfer routes
of PLP and TA substrates.
2. Architecture of TAs
2.1. Typical Overall Structure
In general, TAs belong to the two fold types (I and IV) of PLP-depen-
dent enzymes [6]. With the exception of three TA groups, such as D-
amino acid TAs, branched-chain TAs, and (R)-amine TAs, all TAs belong
to fold type I [6]. Each TA has a speciﬁc amino donor and amino acceptor
as its substrate. Such enzymatic speciﬁcity has been considered the con-
sequence of evolutionary divergence, starting from two ancestral pro-
teins. In addition, a number of TAs exist as dimers in solution, with a
monomeric molecular weight of approximately 45,000, which implies
that most TAs function as a dimer in the cellular environment. However,
there are some TAs that exist as tetramers or hexamers. Apparently, the
multimeric state of TAs depends on the species from which they origi-
nate. We summarize the proﬁles of TAs mentioned in this review in
Table 1. As a typical TA structure, here we brieﬂy describe the overall
structure of anωTA fromC. violaceum(Cv-ωTA; PDB ID: 4A6T), which
is categorized as a fold type I TA and functions as a dimer [23].
Cv-ωTA is a good model in terms of its structural diversity, since its
four crystal structures have been determined, of which two are the
apo form, one is the holo form, and the remaining structure is a mixture
of the apo and holo forms. Cv-ωTA exists as a dimer both in solution and
in the crystal environment (Fig. 1A). Each subunit of the dimer consists
of two domains: a large domain and a small domain (Fig. 1B). The large
domain adopts a three-layeredα/β/α sandwich fold, with a central par-
allel β sheet. The small domain is subdivided into an N-terminal lobe
and a C-terminal lobe, which are linked to the large domain. It is note-
worthy that the two lobes of the small domain spatially combine with
each other, even though their amino acid sequences are discontinuous.
2.2. Active Site Chemistry
The active site of TAs is located at the interface between two sub-
units and simultaneously, between two domains, with a PLP molecule
positioned at the bottom (Fig. 1C). In the“resting period” of the catalytic
cycle, PLP forms a Schiff base by covalently binding to an adjacent Lys
residue. It is a striking structural feature of TAs that some residues
from one subunit are directly involved in the formation of the active
site of the other subunit. This is the rationale for the need of TAs to
form oligomers to properly function as enzymes [16,28].
The PLP-bind-
ing site is located somewhat far from the entrance of the active site,
resulting in a relatively deep funnel toward the active site (Fig. 1D).
Surface electrostatic potential analysis has revealed that positively
charged residues are predominantly distributed on the active site funnel
(as discussed in more detail inSection 5). These structural traits de-
scribed above are well conserved among TAs (Fig. 1E).
In the crystal structure of the holo form of Cv-ωTA, PLP links to the
Lys288 residue, indicating that the structure is a snapshot of the resting
period. UV–visible spectrometric analysis can be used to determine
whether the cofactor is PLP or PMP, because the respective molecules
show different absorption spectra. Previous studies have demonstrated
that the PLP-bound form exhibits an absorption peak at approximately
420 nm, whereas the PMP-bound form has an absorption peak at ap-
proximately 330 nm [29,30]. UV–visible absorption spectra, thus, pro-
vide information on a corresponding step in the whole catalytic cycle.
The PLP cofactor interacts with neighboring residues and water mole-
cules (Fig. 1F). The three oxygen atoms in the phosphate group of PLP
form salt bridges with Gly120, Ser121, and Thr321. The carbon atoms
1032 S. Kwon, H.H. Park / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 (2019) 1031–1039
on PLP also form hydrophobic interactions with adjacent hydrophobic
residues, such as Tyr153, Gly155, Val261, Ile262, and Phe320. The C4′
atom on the PLP ring covalently binds to theε-amino group of the
Lys288 residue. In addition, four water molecules are also involved in
PLP coordination. The phosphate group interacts with three water mol-
ecules, two of which mediate the interaction between the oxygen atoms
of the phosphate group and the backbone atoms of Asn118, Gly319, and
Tyr322. The oxygen atom on the aromatic ring also forms a network
with Glu226 and Ala231 mediated by a water molecule. Overall, the
PLP cofactor isﬁxed by forming many hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interactions with neighboring residues and water molecules. Notably,
Gly319, Thr321, and Tyr322 from the other subunit also contribute to
PLP ﬁxation. Such active site chemistry signiﬁes that the dimer of TAs
is the minimum functional unit required for catalytic activity.
In addition, given that transamination is achieved by chemical re-
actions such as nucleophilic substitution and general base catalysis,
the protonation states of PLP and adjacent residues, along with the ge-
ometry in the active site, are crucial for catalysis. Recent studies have
shown the protonation states in the active site and the geometry of
the Schiff base linked to the pyridine ring [31,32]. Dajnowicz et al.
determined the neutron crystal structure of an aspartate aminotrans-
ferase from Sus scrofa, in which one subunit and the other subunit
showed the internal aldimine form and external aldimine form,
respectively [31]. In the internal aldimine form, the C4’ atom of PLP
covalently binds to theε-amino group of Lys258, whereas the C4’
atom of PLP is covalently linked to the Cα atom ofα-methylaspartate
in the external aldimine form. The authors showed that the
deprotonated nitrogen atom of the Schiff base in the internal aldimine
form adopts non-planarity to the pyridine ring, and hyperconjugation
between theσ orbital and empty or partially occupied antibondingπ
orbital of the Schiff base contributes to stabilization of the ground
state of the external aldimine [31,32].
Another noticeable structural feature of the active site is that it
consists of two pockets (P- and O-pockets), which are different in size,
depending on the fold type and class of TAs [5,13,15,27]. As shown in
Fig. 1C, these pockets are also observed in Cv-ωTA. These spatial differ-
ences restrict the size and orientation of the functional groups of the
substrate upon the enzyme-substrate complex formation. In other
words, the bulkier functional groups of the substrate are oriented
towardst the large pocket, whereas the smaller functional groups are

assigned to the small pocket, thus satisfying a structural orientation of
prerequisites required for enantioselectivity [5,13,15,27].
2.3. Multimeric State as a Functional Unit
It is well known that TAs play biological roles as multimeric forms.
They can form dimers, tetramers, and hexamers, depending on the spe-
cies from which they originate. A number of biochemical studies have
demonstrated multimeric states of TAs in solution, implying that they
are functional units in the cellular environment. A dimeric form in solu-
tion is observed for TAs fromMycobacterium tuberculosis(PDB ID: 2CIN,
2CJD, 2CJG, and 2CJH) [33], Helicobacter pylori(PDB ID: 2FN6, 2FNI, and
2FNU) [34], Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK (PDB ID: 2YKU, 2YKV, 2YKX,
2YKY, 4AO4, and 6IZ9) [26,27], Arthrobacter sp. KNK168 (PDB ID:
3WWH, 3WWI, and 3WWJ) [35], Chromobacterium violaceum(PDB ID:
4A6R, 4A6T, 4A6U, and 4A72) [23], Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17 (PDB ID: 4E3Q,
4E3R, and 5ZTX) [24,25], Thermoproteus uzoniensis (PDB ID: 5CE8)
[30], Gluconobacter oxydans[36,37], andLactococcus lactis[38]. How-
ever, TAs fromPseudomonas aeruginosa[39], Vulcanisaeta moutnovskia
[40], Pseudomonas putida(PDB ID: 3A8U) [41], andMesorhizobium loti
(PDB ID: 2Z9U, 2Z9V, and 2Z9W) [42] exist as tetramers in solution
and in a crystal environment. Lastly, a TA fromMethanococcus aeolicus
forms a hexamer in solution [43].
It is not fully understood why TAs exist as diverse multimeric forms
such as dimers, tetramers, and hexamers in solution, depending on their
fold type or host species. Alternatively, it is worth investigating whether
TAs maintain their unique multimeric states, taking into account the fact
that the active site is formed at the interface between subunits. Hence,
TAs should retain at least a dimeric state to properly function as an en-
zyme. A recent study showed that the dissociation of PMP from a PMP-
bound TA results in aggregation of the TA, by forming unstable
apoenzymes and the dissociation rate of PMP is faster in the dimeric
form than in the tetrameric form [44]. The authors also found that the
cofact
or can bind more tightly to the neighboring residues when the
TA is in the tetrameric state than when it is in the dimeric state.
However, it is not clear whether dimeric TAs are exposed to a cellular
environment that restricts the dissociation of PMP. If tetrameric TAs
do not have other options to avoid enzymatic inactivation by the disso-
ciation of PMP, their unique tetramer formation may be a consequence
of evolutionary adaptation to maintain a stable state.
3. Structural Differences Between the Apo and Holo Forms
Previous studies have reported the effect of PLP on the structure and
function of TAs by comparing structures between apo and holo forms
[23,25,26]. Humble et al. determined the apo (PDB ID: 4A6R; apo1 and
4A6U; apo2) and holo (PDB ID: 4A6T) structures of Cv-ωTA [23]. This
crystallographic study provides valuable information on structural dif-
ferences, in that the crystal structures revealed conformational diversity
in response to molecules incorporated in the active site. In the apo2
structure, three regions (R5–A33 and G152–P178 from chain A and
I311–F320 from chain B) are disordered, but are ordered in the holo
form (Fig. 2A; black dashed oval). These disordered regions correspond-
ing to 66 residues, indicate that they are highlyﬂexible in the apo form.
These regions are important because they constitute the components of
the active site. Furthermore, some of the active site-forming residues
from the other chain (T321–S323 from chain B) show different spatial
positions between the apo and holo forms (Fig. 2A; red dashed oval).
These results suggest that PLP incorporation results in structural rear-
rangement and stabilization of the disordered regions, thereby forming
the complete active site.

It is also noteworthy that the structures of apo1, containing a tetra-
mer of poly(acrylic acid) near the active site and apo2 are different
from each other. In the apo1 structure, some residues (residues G152–
H170 and D174–P178 form chain A and I311–F320 from chain B) are or-
dered (Fig. 2A; black dashed oval). This may be the consequence of
structural stabilization induced by poly(acrylic acid). In apo1, however,
the neighboring-chain region observed in the holo form (I311–F320
from chain B) adopts similar spatial coordinates to those in apo2, rather
than those in the holo form. This means that only PLP can induce the
conformational change of the corresponding region to complete the
speciﬁc active site architecture.
A comparative study of the apo and holo forms of Vf-ωTA also
showed a similar structural pattern to Cv-ωTA [25]. The holo forms of
Vf-ωTA were reported as two types: PLP-bound and PMP-bound types
[24]. However, although the chemical state of the cofactor was different,
signiﬁcant structural differences between the two types were not found.
In the apo structure, the region corresponding to Asn2–Lys28 from
chain A is disordered (Fig. 2B; black dashed circle) and the spatial ar-
rangement of the active site-forming residues from chain B (F321–
G325) is different from those in the holo forms, which are located in
the proximity of the cofactor (Fig. 2B; black dashed oval). In particular,
the neighboring-chain residues (I311–P318 from chain B) exhibit high

B-factor values (Fig. 2B; red dashed oval), implying that this region may
retain structural plasticity in the apo form to facilitate transformation
into the holo form.
In addition, the effect of PLP on active site formation has been re-
ported in a structural study comparing the apo form and the holo
form of a β-transaminase from Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK [26].
Three major disordered regions (DR1–3) found near the active site in
the apo form are ordered in the holo form (Fig. 2C). While DR1 (residues
1–16) and DR2 (residues 48–59) are from chain A, DR3 (residues 300–
311) is from chain B. The active site architecture in the apo form is as-
sumed to beﬂexible owing to the three DR regions, whereas that in
the holo form is speciﬁc for the substrate binding. Thus, PLP is assumed
to contribute to the structural stabilization of the DR regions, resulting
in the formation of a precise active site. As discussed in this structural
study paper [26], considering that the DR regions adopt diverse con-
formers in the absence of PLP, each appropriate conformer may be se-
lected upon binding to PLP, exhibiting the minimum in the free
energy continuum. If this hypothesis is correct, the“disorder-to-order
transition” phenomenon can be explained by the conformational selec-
tion theory [45–50].
These results above are based on structural information obtained by
X-ray crystallography. Although X-ray structures provide valuable in-
formation on protein dynamics, it should be noted that structures in
crystal environments could be different from those in solution. Some lit-
eratures have pointed out structural discrepancy of identical proteins
between X-ray and NMR structures [51,52]. These studies indicate that
interpreting protein dynamics from X-ray structures on both large and
small scales is based on a premise of somewhat conﬁned crystal
environments.
Finally, a biochemical study has been reported evaluating
differences in thermal stability between the apo and holo forms of
PLP-dependent human ornithineδ-aminotransferase (hOAT) [53]. The
authors performed biochemical analyses, such as analytical ultracentri-
fugation, size exclusion chromatography, and circular dichroism to in-
vestigate the multimeric state and thermal stability of the apo and
holo forms of hOAT. The apo and holo forms were shown to haveTm
values of 46 °C and 67 °C, respectively, and the apo form was found to
be more susceptible to denaturation and aggregation than the holo
form. In addition, the tetrameric apo form was more resistant to dena-
turation and aggregation than the dimeric apo form. These results dem-
onstrate that PLP plays a vital role in the structural stabilization of hOAT
and the degree of interaction between subunits is associated with main-
taining its intrinsic structure.
4. Dual Substrate Recognition Mechanism
TAs have the enzymatic property to exploit two different kinds of
substrates at the same active site. Such a fact allows us to investigate
structural differences between an amino group donor-bound form and
an amino group acceptor-bound form. A structural study on substrate-
bound structures of Ms-βTA provides insights into the dual substrate
mechanism of TAs [27]. Wybenga et al. determined crystal structures
of Ms-βTA in complex with its substrates, including (S)-β-pheny
lala-
nine, (R)-3-amino-5-methylhexanoic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, and its in-
hibitor [27]. In all the tested complexes, the respective functional
groups of the substrates were found to interact with the appropriate
side chains of key residues in the active site. In the complex with (S)-
β-phenylalanine, the carboxylic acid group forms a salt bridge with
Arg54, whereas the phenyl group interacts with hydrophobic residues,
such as Ile56, Tyr89, Ala225, Met256, Met414 (from one subunit), and
Ala312 (from the other subunit, Fig. 2D, yellow). (R)-3-amino-5-
methylhexanoic acid, retaining the aliphatic chain, constitutes a com-
parative object with the aromatic compound, (S)-β-phenylalanine, in
terms of chemical properties. In the (R)-3-amino-5-methylhexanoic
acid-bound structure, the functional groups of the substrate are ori-
ented in the same mode as those of (S)-β-phenylalanine (Fig. 2D,
tint). The 2-oxoglutarate-bound form, however, shows a somewhat dif-
ferent pattern of interaction. Contrary to the two substrates discussed
above, theα-carboxylic acid group of 2-oxoglutarate forms a salt bridge
with Arg412 (Fig. 2E, magenta). The keto oxygen atom is oriented to-
ward the nitrogen atom of Lys280, which is covalently bound to PLP.
Structural comparison studies have identiﬁed subtle structural dif-
ferences between the two amino group donor complexes and the
amino group acceptor complex. While no signiﬁcant structural differ-
ences were found between the (S)-β-phenylalanine-bound form and
the (R)-3-amino-5-methylhexanoic acid-bound form, the binding of
2-oxoglutarate gave rise to spatial rearrangements of Ala312 and
Arg412. When complexed with 2-oxoglutarate, the position of Ala312
deviates somewhat from theγ-carboxylic acid group of 2-oxoglutarate,
maintaining a distance of 3.5 Å. This may occur to avoid a steric clash
that would happen if Ala312 did not deviate spatially. It is also notewor-
thy that the position of Arg412 is adjusted to form a salt bridge with the
α-carboxylic acid group of 2-oxoglutarate. Comparative analysis of Ms-
βTA shows that some residues in the active site are precisely rearranged
in response to substrates. Thus, the dual substrate recognition of Ms-
βTA can be explained by the inducedﬁt mechanism, by which it has
been described that structural changes of enzymes occur upon binding
to their substrates [54].
The inducedﬁt mechanism has also been exploited to explain a do-
main movement observed in aspartate aminotransferases [55,56]f r o m
Escherichia coli. It is well known that many TAs undergo a large confor-
mational change from an open to a closed form upon the binding of the
substrate [16]. This conformational change occurs by the access of the
small domain to the active site entrance. In the closed form, the active
site is covered with part of the small domain, precluding outer water
molecules from entering the active site [16].
As
another dual substrate recognition mechanism, the lock and
key model, along with the induced ﬁt model, has been proposed
by Hirotsu et al. to describe the dual substrate recognition mecha-
nism of TAs [16]. The lock and key model,ﬁrst suggested by Emil Fi-
scher in 1894 is the theory that enzymes bind complementarily to
their substrates for catalysis as a key (substrate)ﬁts precisely into
a lock (enzyme). Based on X-ray crystallographic studies, they ana-
lyzed the following TA structures: 1) aromatic amino acid amino-
transferase from Paracoccus denitriﬁcans (AroAT) (PDB ID: 1AY4)
[17] and its maleate (PDB ID: 1AY5) and 3-phenylpropionate (PDB
ID: 1AY8)-bound forms [18], 2) histidinol-phosphate aminotransfer-
ase from E. coli (HspAT; PDB ID: 1GEW) and its histidinol-phos-
phate- (PDB ID: 1GEX) and N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)-L-glutamate
(PDB ID: 1GEY)-bound forms [ 19], 3) glutamine-phenylpyruvate
aminotransferase from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (GlnAT; PDB ID:
1V2D) and its 3-phenylpropionate (PDB ID: 1V2F)-bound form
[20], 4) acetylornithine aminotransferase fromThermus thermophilus
HB8 (AcOAT; PDB ID: 1VEF) and its N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)-Nα-
acetyl-L-ornithine- (PDB ID: 1WKG) and N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)-
L-glutamate (PDB ID: 1WKH)-bound forms [16], and 5) branched-
chain amino acid aminotransferase from E. coli (BCAT; PDB ID:
1I1K) and its 4-methylvalerate (PDB ID: 1I1M) [21] and glutamate
(PDB ID: 1IYE)-bound forms [22]. The authors observed that salt
bridge formation between residues and substrates in the active site,
along with a hydrogen bond network as required, are involved in
the rearrangements of the key residues. They concluded that AroAT
recognizes dual substrates via the inducedﬁt mechanism, whereas
BCAT utilizes the lock and key mechanism to recognize its sub-
strates. In the cases of HspAT, GlnAT, and AcOAT, dual substrate rec-
ognition occurs by a combination of the two mechanisms, although
they differ in their dependence on each mechanism.
5. Electrostatic Steering for Cofactor and Substrate Binding
Surface electrostatic analysis of Ms-βTA has revealed that positively
charged residues are dominantly distributed at the active site, whereas
1036 S. Kwon, H.H. Park / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 (2019) 1031–1039
negatively charged residues are sparsely distributed in adjacent regions
of the entrance to the active site (Fig. 2F) [26]. It is possible that this dis-
tribution pattern is generalized for all TAs, considering that the corre-
sponding residues are evolutionarily conserved ( Fig. 1E). Such a
unique surface feature signiﬁes that it can generate a potent electric
ﬁeld, thereby attracting negatively charged molecules into the active
site. As an example, electricﬁeld formation around Ms-βTA has been de-
scribed using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver [57]( Fig. 2G). It is
also noteworthy that PLP and amino group acceptors, such as pyruvate
or 2-oxoglutarate, retain strong negative charges. Accordingly, it is rea-
sonable to assume that PLP and substrates as amino group acceptors are
attracted into the active site by the electricﬁeld. This phenomenon has
been called electrostatic steering [58–60]. For amino group donors such
as amino acids, considering that they are zwitterions, mostly retaining a
net charge of 0, simple diffusion rather than electrostatic steering is as-
sumed to constitute a driving force for access to the active site.
Due to the nature of the electrical phenomenon around proteins,
however, it is difﬁcult to experimentally verify the electrostatic steering
mechanism with biophysical measurements. However, previous studies
using computational analyses, such as Brownian dynamics (BD); elec-
trostatic calculations based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; elec-
trostatic potential similarity analysis, along with site-directed
mutagenesis, have shown that this mechanism is plausible [58–63].
Based on the results of these studies, it has been concluded that electro-
static properties in the vicinity of the substrate-binding sites of en-
zymes, such as superoxide dismutase, acetylcholinesterase, and
barnase, give rise to electrostatic steering for substrate binding. These
studies have also shown that the introduction of charged residues to
the active site increases the rate of association of these enzymes with
their respective substrates, implying that the results may be due to en-
hanced electrostatic potential [59,61,62]. These results also agree with
predictions from BD simulations, based on theﬁnite-difference linear-
ized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Therefore, surface electrostatic po-
tential analysis of TAs constitutes circumstantial evidence to support
the electrostatic steering phenomenon.
Although we here present the electrostatic steering model as a pos-
sible scenario, other possibilities need to be explored. For example, it
might be possible that PLP insertion into the active site is mediated by
a PLP-delivery protein, or insertion of amino group acceptors along
with PLP is achieved by simple diffusion. In addition, the electrostatic
steering mechanism may not be applied to all PLP-dependent enzymes.
At the present stage of our knowledge, the actual PLP and substrate in-
sertion mechanism still remains elusive.
6. A Possible Working Mechanism of TAs
On the basis of these biochemical and structural studies of TAs, we
here propose the following working mechanism of TAs, including PLP
and substrate insertion into the active site (Fig. 3).
(i) A multimeric functional unit, such as a dimer, is formed via the
assembly of monomers.
(ii) An electricﬁeld generated around the TA induces the insertion of
PLP into the active site. Flexible active site architecture facilitates
PLP incorporation. Conformational selection and induced ﬁt
models are associated with this step.
(iii) An amino group donor substrate binds to the active site pocket.
Diffusional collision drives the amino group donor into the active
site. The lock and key and inducedﬁt mechanisms are applied at
this step.
(iv) The primary by-product, upon the formation of PMP, is expelled
f
rom the active site.
(v) An amino group acceptor substrate binds to the active site
pocket. The electric ﬁeld plays the same role as in step (ii).
The lock and key and inducedﬁt mechanisms are involved in
this step.
(vi) The transferring of the amino group from PMP gives rise to the
ﬁnal product.
(vii) Theﬁnal product is expelled from the active site.
7. Summary and Outlook
The crystal structures of fold type I TAs, determined by X-ray crystal-
lography, have provided signiﬁcant information on the details of the ac-
tive site, as well as the overall architecture of the enzymes. Based on
comparative analyses of the structures of native forms and substrate-
bound forms, it has been found that residues forming the active site
are precisely rearranged and simultaneously undergo local conforma-
tional changes upon PLP and substrate binding. The speciﬁc and diverse
substrate selectivity of fold type I TAs, along with PLP insertion, is an
evolutionary consequence of adopting their unique structures. How-
ever, despite the valuable information accumulated thus far on the
structure and function of fold type I TAs, investigations of TA structural
dynamics have depended on structural comparison andB-factor analy-
sis. These analyses allow us to infer conformational changes corre-
sponding to the respective steps in the catalytic cycle and provide
information on their intrinsic mobility. Nevertheless, some outstanding
issues remain to be resolved. For example, it is not clear which pathway
is involved in the structural stabilization of the active site by PLP during
the “disorder-to-order transition” phenomenon. Moreover, it still re-
mains elusive whether tetrameric or hexameric TAs take catalytic ad-
vantages over dimeric TAs by maintaining structural stability. In
addition, the TA structures that have been characterized to date include
those from psychrophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organ-
isms as well as mesophilic organisms. This diversity, in terms of thermo-
stability, gives us an opportunity to investigate structural determinants
affecting thermal tolerance. Although structural determination of TAs
has depended on X-ray crystallography thus far, it is possible that
their real movements in the cellular environment could be different
from results observed by X-ray crystallography. Integrated analytical
methods including computational methods, such as molecular

dynamics simulation, along with biochemical and biophysical analyses,
may solve the remaining enigmas concerning TAs.
