This study explores the chemoenzymatic synthesis of (S)-baclofen,
which involves a sequential combination of transition metal
catalysis and biocatalysis. The synthesis approach starts from a
readily accessible cinnamic acid ester that is converted using a
rhodium-based hydroformylation catalyst toward the corresponding
chiral aldehyde. This compound is subsequently converted via a
transaminase-catalyzed reaction system that yields the desired
β-chiral amino acid ester and the final freeβ-chiral amino acid
(S)-baclofen after a simple hydrolysis reaction. This synthesis
concept does provide high atom efficiency and does not require
an additional chiral resolution step of a racemic product.
1. Introduction
The task of producing pharmaceuticals comprises a multitude
of challenges for modern synthetic organic chemistry, which
starts with the design of an “ideal ” retrosynthetic strategy
being capable, besides other benefits, to minimize reaction
steps when starting from cheap and readily available raw
materials. [1] Other criteria to be matched are excellent product
quality, low production costs, sustainability, and scalability. [2]
Furthermore, rather than being a “single product solution, ”
such a developed process ideally shows the feasibility to be
extended toward a technolog y platform being suitable to
produce a broad range of re lated compounds on scale. [3]
Particular chances for achieving these goals arise from
utilizing the full spectrum of catalytic methods, including
chemocatalysis and biocatalysis, as well as process engineer-
ing techniques. [4] Although this conclusion and such process
goals seem logical and even trivial, they have often not
yet become realized in practice.[5] In particular, the integration
of biocatalysis as a tool in orga nic synthesis labs often still
faces a substantial entrance barrier for chemists. Obviously,
overcoming such hurdles woul d enable unique novel retro-
synthetic pathways toward cha llenging pharmaceutical com-
pounds with enormous synt hetic benefits in terms of
shortened synthesis routes, reducing the amount of waste
and increasing overall yield, thus contributing to improved
economy as well as sustainability of the overall process. [6,7]
In particular, for chiral amine synthesis, transaminases
have proven to be a valuable tool with multiple established
applications, including processes in the pharmaceutical
industry. [8]
In the following study we showcase how exactly such a
combination of complementary technologies from these differ-
ent worlds of chemocatalysis and biocatalysis can lead to an
efficient synthetic strategy with potential for industrial applica-
tion, exemplified for the general class ofβ-chiral amino acids. In
particular, we demonstrate this for one enantiomer of baclofen
(Scheme 1), which is an important drug used for muscle spas-
ticity treatment and other medical applications.[9] Our chemo-
enzymatic strategy starts with the hydroformylation of a readily
available cinnamic acid ester, resulting in the corresponding
chiral aldehyde. The subsequent transaminase-catalyzed reac-
tion then yields the intermediate (S)-baclofen ester, which, in
part, undergoes partial cyclization to a lactam and eventually
hydrolysis as the free β-chiral amino acid and final product
(S)-baclofen.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Hydroformylation of Cinnamic Acid Derivatives toward
Baclofen Precursors
The first step in the synthetic strategy for the production of
baclofen is a rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation starting from
the corresponding α,β-unsaturated 4-chlorocinnamate ( 1). In
general, hydroformylation is a widely applied technology with
various large-scale applicatio ns for conversion of alkenes with
syngas toward aldehydes, [10,11] and in our previous work we
reported the spectroscopic investigation of the hydroformyla-
tion of methyl 4-chlorocinnamate with a commercial sample
and showed a process development including the optimization
using a design of experiments approach. 4-Chlorocinnamate
esters (1) can be viewed as derivatives of either styrene or
acrylates and represent a challenging substrate regarding
the desired regioselectivity in the hydroformylation. With
different unmodified Rh complexes, theβ-regioselective hydro-
formylation was observed.[12,13] This preferred selectivity served
as the basis for this work, which focuses on the applicability
and scale-up. As the catalyst, we employed a commercial
sample of a Rh catalyst named“[HRh(PPh 3)4],” which behaved
like an unmodified Rh catalyst and showed comparable results
to [Rh(acac)(CO)2].[12] Scheme 2 shows the reaction pathway to
the desired β-aldehyde 2 and the regioisomeric α-aldehyde 3.
The latter was also detected as the tautomeric enol, which is in
accordance with the literature.[14] Potentially formed by-products
are the hydrogenated 3-(4-chlorophenyl)propanoate ( 4) and
3-(4-chlorophenyl)propanal (5). The first is the most prevalent
by-product. In the following, the hydroformylations are evaluated
according to the conversion, regioselectivity and selectivity to
the β-aldehyde 2. The regioselectivity is defined as formation
of the β-aldehyde 2 over the sum ofβ- and α-aldehydes 2 and
3. The term selectivity is defined as the preferredβ-aldehyde 2
over all by-products.
2.2. Substrate Screening and Substrate Loading
In terms of atom economy concerning the overall synthesis of
baclofen, 4-chlorocinnamic acid would be an ideal substrate
for hydroformylation. However, its solubility in organic solvents
is very limited. To determine the most suitable cinnamate, the
ester residue of the hydroformylation substrate was modified
from methyl to ethyl and isopropyl. Methyl 4-chlorocinnamate
(1a) and the ethyl and isopropyl esters1b and 1c were synthesized
from the corresponding acid through esterification. The hydrofor-
mylation under standard conditions (80 bar CO/H2 (1:1), 80 °C)
resulted in a comparable conversion and regioselectivity for the
methyl 1a,e t h y l1b and isopropyl ester1c (Table 1).
The hydroformylation of isopropyl 4-chlorocinnamate ( 1c)
showed the highest selectivity to theβ-aldehyde 2 of 75%, which
was only slightly higher than that with methyl and ethyl groups.
Thus, the residue seems to have a negligible influence on hydro-
formylation in terms of electronic or steric factors. For the overall

baclofen synthesis, either the hydroformylation product2 or the
aminated derivative needs to be hydrolyzed. The methyl ester1a
was chosen as substrate due to its atomic economy and its
increased solubility compared to the ethyl and isopropyl ester.
To theoretically enhance the regioselectivity by increasing the
steric hindrance at the α-position, we synthesized dimethyl
2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)malonate ( 7) in a Knoevenagel reaction
with a good isolated yield of 51%. The hydroformylation of
dimethyl 2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)malonate ( 7)r e s u l t e di np r e -
dominantly formed hydrogenated by-product 9 with 59–94%
(Scheme 3 , for details see Supporting Information). Only
<5% of aldehyde signal was obtained in 1H-NMR spectra
despite changing the gas composition of CO and H 2 (from
6:1 to 1:3). Thus, dimethyl 2-(4 -chlorobenzylidene)malonate
(7) is not suitable as substrate for the regioselective hydrofor-
mylation required to synthesize β-aldehyde 2.
Regarding the applicability of hydroformylation and the
space–time yield, we increased the substrate concentration step-
wise from the standard conditions of 0.6 M following Botteghi
and Paganelli[15] and our previous work.[13] Hydroformylation of
methyl 4-chlorochinnamate (1a) at 80 °C under 80 bar CO/H2 with
substrate concentrations of 1.0–2.6 M resulted in high conver-
sions of 91–97% (Table 2).
Comparable regioselectivities of 83–84% and selectivities of
63–65% were obtained. In contrast to 0.6 M substrate concentra-
tion (88% regioselectivity, 68% selectivity),[12] the regioselectivity
and selectivity to the β-aldehyde 2a were slightly lower. With
a substrate concentration of 2.6 M, the space–time yield was
successfully increased by a factor of 4.3.
2.3. Ligand Screening
As reported recently by us, unmodified Rh complexes are the
preferred catalytic species to obtain a high regioselectivity in
hydroformylation of β-aryl-substituted α,β-unsaturated esters,
in comparison with the simple and widely used triphenylphosphine
ligand.[12] Based on these findings, we screened various different
phosphine ligands compared to triphenylphosphine with the
aim to investigate its electronic influence and to optimize the regio-
selectivity toward the β-aldehyde 2a. The hydroformylation of
methyl 4-chlorocinnamate (1a) was performed with 0.1 mol%
[Rh(acac)(CO)2] and 0.5 mol% phosphine ligand under 80 bar
CO/H2 (1:1) at 80 °C (Table 3).
According to the Tolman electronic parameters,
tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine would be expected to have
the most electron donating properties (˜v(CO) = 2066.1 cm/C0 1),[5]
while the phosphine ligand is less electron-rich with
R’= CH3 ˜v(CO) = 2066.7 cm/C0 1),[16] H ( ˜v(CO) = 2068.9 cm/C0 1),[5]
and F ( ˜v(CO) = 2071.2 cm/C0 1).[16] The weakest donor properties

are probably achieved with CF3, as this is a strongly electron
withdrawing group.[17] Corresponding to the assumed increasing
electron withdrawing properties of the ligands, the regioselectivity
was highest (74%) with the phosphine carrying two CF3 groups in
meta-position. With stronger electron donating groups as the
methoxy group, only a regioselectivity of 37% was observed.
The weaker coordinating tris[3,5-bis(trifluormethyl)phenyl]phosphine
compared to PPh3 could dissociate more easily and would probably
generate HRh(CO)4.[10] According to the literature, unmodified
rhodium catalysts probably form rhodium-carbonyl hydride
[HRh(CO)x]( x = 3,4) as catalytic active species leading to the
highest regioselectivity with methyl 4-chlorocinnamate (1a)a s
substrate (see Table 1 and 2).
2.4. Scale-Up and Product Isolation
The next step was focused on the product isolation. The work-up
of reaction mixtures after hydroformylation was processed in
three different ways: filtration via celite including removal of
the solvent, column chromatography, and the formation of the
bisulfite adduct with subsequent release. The concept of bisulfite
adduct formation is that aldehydes2a and 3a are converted into
water-soluble bisulfite adducts, while substrate1a and by-products
remain in the organic phase. Afterward, the aldehyde is released.
The easiest, most sustainable, and economic method is the first
one. However, the formed by-products cannot be separated with
this method. Consequently, this work-up can only be applied, if the
following enzymatic transamination works in the presence of the
most prevalent by-product 4a. For this reason, we compared
the second and third method on a small scale (0.4–0.8 g crude
product). After bisulfite adduct formation and release, as described
in the literature for related aldehydes[18] including an additional
washing step, only an isolated yield of less than 2% was obtained.
Purification by column chroma tography resulted in a higher
isolated yield of 32% for β-aldehyde 2a with a purity of 93%
(7% α-product 3a). The efficacy of the hydroformylation of
methyl 4-chlorocinnamate ( 1a) was demonstrated through a
scale-up (fourfold increase) with 0.1 mol% [Rh(acac)(CO) 2]a s
unmodified Rh complex. After 1 5 h, a high regioselectivity
of 91% and a selectivity of 77% were achieved. Methyl
3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxobutanoate ( 2a) was isolated, purified
by column chromatography and obtained with a moderate
yield of 41% and a purity of 92% (8% α-aldehyde 3a), thus
indicating a slight increase o f the regioisomeric ratio.
2.5. Preliminary Biocatalyst Screening
Amine transaminases are known for their superior stereoselectivity
in the asymmetric conversion of ketones into (S)- or (R)-amines.[7,19]
However, many ATAs show only a moderate selectivity in the
discrimination of the aldehyde’s enantiomers. For the preparation
of baclofen, an ATA had to be identified that converts the methyl
ester of the precursor aldehyde,2a, or its hydrolyzed free acid,
3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, 2d. To identify suitable
enzymes, we performed a two-step screening procedure of our
inhouse transaminase library, which contained 55 wild-type
ATAs and 200 variants.
The enzymes were produced by cultivating Escherichia coli
BL21 cells harboring the coding ATA genes and subsequent puri-
fication of the proteins in 96-well microtiter plates. In the first
screening approach (Scheme S1A, Supporting Information), we
conducted the reverse reaction and incubated rac-Baclofen
and rac-Baclofen methyl ester as substrates with the enzymes
together with pyruvate, as this is the universal amino acceptor
used by most wild-type ATA. The coproduct L-alanine is then
converted by alanine dehydrogenase to pyruvate and NADH,
which then generates a colored formazan dye by subsequent
steps (see Supporting Information). As (R)-selective ATAs exclu-
sively form D-alanine as the coproduct, we included an alanine
racemase in the assay mixture to expand the assay for screening
ATAs with ( R)-selectivity. In the second screening reaction
(Scheme S1B, Supporting Information), we employed the aceto-
phenone assay to investigate enzymes in the desired forward
reaction (see Supporting Information). In this approach, we used
rac-1-phenylethaneamine as the amino donor withrac-2a or 2d
as substrates. In case of activity, the coproduct acetophenone was
detected at 245 nm. The advantage here is that enzymes that do
not accept alanine as an amino donor can also be identified. From
these screening reactions, we identified three wild-type ATAs and
11 variants which showed activities in at least one of the assays.
Especially interesting was to find a transaminase which also
accepts isopropylamine as its amino donor.
After obtaining the screening results for potential enzymes
for the conversion of the esterified aldehyde substrate, we
decided to continue with the three most promising candidates
from the screening, which showed the highest activity toward it.
Thus, two variants of the transaminase fromVibrio fluvialis(56 V/
57C/153 G/415C and 56 V/57C/415 F/417 A) and the wild-type of
the transaminase fromArthrobacter sp. KNK168 (ATA 117wt) were
selected. All genes were expressed according to the standard
expression method and the produced catalysts were used as lyoph-
ilized whole cells (dry weight whole cells— dwc) and/or lyophilized
cell extracts. All enzyme variations showed activity with baclofen
methyl ester substrate (methyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxobutanoate)
in test reactions (data not shown), whereas the typically
(R)-selective ATA 117wt proved to be the most promising
candidate, displaying the highest activity with isopropylamine
as its amino donor.[20]
2.6. Reaction Engineering toward Baclofen Synthesis Using
the Transaminase ATA 117 fromArthrobacter sp. KNK168
Two rather similar substrates were chosen for the investigation:
methyl-4-oxo-3-phenylbutanoate ( 10) and methyl-3-(4-chloro-
phenyl)-4-oxobutanoate ( 2a, the final substrate for baclofen
ester synthesis). 10, being the nonhalogenated version of the
actual baclofen substrate, was used for screenings to determine
suitable reaction conditions. Furthermore, since during synthesis
of both substrates 12–24% of a reduced by-product ( 4) was
formed, we investigated its potential to inhibit the ATA-
catalyzed reaction. All utilized substrates were synthesized

via hydroformylation as described above and used in the sub-
sequent biotransformations. The control reaction contained
100 mM of 10 and was incubated for 24 h with the reaction
cocktail (1 mL; 50 mM HEPES pH8, 250 mM IPA, 2.5 mM PLP,
30 °C, 900 rpm, 80 U mL/C0 1 of dwc with overexpressed ATA
117 wt). We observed the formation of 31 mM of product
11b; however, in the presence of 50 mM chlorinated hydroge-
nated adduct (4), a significant inhibitory effect diminished the
yield to only 14 mM of product.Thus, synthesized substrates
would need to be purified prior to use.
To further shift the equilibrium of the baclofen synthesis,
an in situ product removal approach was chosen. It was shown
previously that baclofen esters tend to cyclize to the lactam
4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (14), also known as baclofen
impurity A, under basic conditions (seeScheme 4).[21] The final
product (S)-baclofen is obtained from this intermediate via hydro-
lysis. Since transaminases usually work under basic conditions,
some of the produced baclofen ester might cyclize and precipi-
tate as a solid phase. If this fact could be exploited, it would yield
higher conversions of baclofen from the last enzymatic synthetic
step through a simple in situ product removal step (via a second-
ary solid phase) and thus shift the reaction equilibrium. However,
two further by-products were also detected in the reaction. As
previously described for other α-chiral aldehydes, O2 leads to
the formation of acetophenone (12), which can be minimized
by the degassing of the reaction solution previous to the start
of the reaction.[22] In addition, basic pH values lead to a minimal
percentage of the substrate (2a/10) to cyclize into a lactone
by-product (13) (see Figure S4, Supporting Information).
Therefore, we investigated the influence of higher pH values
on the reaction employing 100 mM of10 at different pH values.
This experiment revealed that the overall yield (sum of11b and
14b) remained constant at a pH range of 8–10 (Figure 1) despite
rising pH values.
Although no inhibitory effect of the product lactamization on
the enzyme was observed, no significant improvement of the
overall yield (in situ product removal effect) was observed either,
despite a higher ratio of autocyclization (see Figure 1). However,
since having the product as a solid phase during the reaction was
perceived as a downstream processing advantage, it was decided
to continue with this line of work.
2.7. Conceptual Experiment for Baclofen Production
After this initial optimization with the nonchlorinated substrate
analog, we went on to engineer the reaction by employing
the true substrate 2a. To increase product concentration, we
designed the reactions as a fed-batch, replenishing substrate
consumption after 24 h. The substrate consumption was calcu-
lated as initial substrate concentration reduced by the formed
concentrations of chloroacetophenone (12a), lactone by-product
(13a), and baclofen lactam (14a). After 24 h, an additional amount
of the catalyst was added to compensate for the reduced enzyme
activity due to deactivation (Table 4). It turned out that the overall
yield with the chlorinated substrate2a was higher than with the
analog 10 (40 vs 30 mM product from 100 mM of substrate after
24 h). As expected, two factors influenced the yield of the pro-
duced baclofen. First, an increase of the pH value to 10 induced
a slightly higher product formation than at pH 8 (Table 4), in

contrast to the nonchlorinated substrate10, where no increase was
observed with rising pH (Figure 1). Second, the addition of enzyme
after 24 h at pH 10 facilitated a continued reaction, resulting in
higher yields (48 mM compared to 75 mM). Otherwise, the reaction
eventually stopped after 24 h. We hypothesize that the harsher
conditions at pH 10 lead to an increased inactivation of the applied
enzyme. Interestingly, while2a was successfully converted, no or
negligible conversion of the regioisomer3a by the enzyme was
observed (see Figure S5, Supporting Information).
Next, we isolated the reaction product14a of the best per-
forming reaction (≈75 mM, pH 10, enzyme refilling) by extraction.
The organic phase was separated and evaporated (evaporating
residual extracted IPA as well), leaving only the extracted baclo-
fen lactam with minor impurities of by-products. The obtained
solid was hydrolyzed in 2 mL of CPME containing 1.5 M HCl for
8 h at 100 °C. After evaporation, (S)-baclofen was obtained with
an enantiomeric ratio of 94:6 (e.e. 88%), as determined by chiral
HPLC. The lowered stereoselectivity of the process could result
either from slow substrate racemization or insufficient stereose-
lectivity of the enzyme. However, related studies and a conducted
racemization NMR experiment (see Figure S11, Supporting
Information) showed that the racemization of the aldehyde
can be considered fairly fast, thus making the influence of kinetic
effects on the stereoselectivity rather unlikely.[23] This means that
the stereoselectivity of the process is most probably lowered by
effects of substrate positioning in the active site of the enzyme.
For α-chiral aldehyde substrates, an additional carbon atom
separates the PLP-bound region from the chiral center, disturbing
substrate positioning and sometimes even leading to the inver-
sion of theω-transaminase’s stereoselectivity.[22]
3. Conclusion
In summary, this study successfully highlights a shortened
chemoenzymatic synthetic route toward (S)-baclofen, a viable
compound for a number of applications, without the need for
expensive catalysts or reagents. Conventionally utilized synthesis
routes usually employ more synthetic steps and mostly produce
racemic baclofen, lowering their atom efficiency due to the need
for a subsequent chiral resolution step.[1,21] The concept involves
a straight-forward approach toward this exemplarily challenging
β-chiral amino acid, while using basically only one hydroformy-
lation and one transaminase-catalyzed reaction. Each individual
synthesis step of the cascade process was thoroughly investi-
gated; the observed side-products identified almost without
exception and minimized and the final synthesis executed to
showcase its viability at synthetic scale. High conversions and
a final product concentration of 75 mM with 88%e.e. (S) validated
the developed synthetic approach, whereas especially the enantio-
meric excess can be improved even further during subsequent
downstream-processing steps, e.g., enantioselective crystallization.
Thus, future process development herein is expected to further
improve overall performance and minimization of the undesired
side products, incl. additional improvement to the (bio)catalysts
itself, which was not part of this study.
