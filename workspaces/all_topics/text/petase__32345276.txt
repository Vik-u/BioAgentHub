Abstract 
Background: For decades, plastic has been a valuable global product due to its convenience and low price. For 
example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was one of the most popular materials for disposable bottles due to its 
beneficial properties, namely impact resistance, high clarity, and light weight. Increasing demand of plastic resulted in 
indiscriminate disposal by consumers, causing severe accumulation of plastic wastes. Because of this, scientists have 
made great efforts to find a way to biologically treat plastic wastes. As a result, a novel plastic degradation enzyme, 
PETase, which can hydrolyze PET, was discovered in Ideonella sakaiensis 201‑F6 in 2016.
Results: A green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which produces PETase, was developed for this study. Two rep‑
resentative strains (C. reinhardtii CC‑124 and CC‑503) were examined, and we found that CC‑124 could express PETase 
well. To verify the catalytic activity of PETase produced by C. reinhardtii, cell lysate of the transformant and PET samples 
were co‑incubated at 30 °C for up to 4 weeks. After incubation, terephthalic acid (TPA), i.e. the fully‑degraded form of 
PET, was detected by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Additionally, morphological changes, such as 
holes and dents on the surface of PET film, were observed using scanning electron microscopy.
Conclusions: A PET hydrolyzing enzyme, PETase, was successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii, and its catalytic activity 
was demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of PETase expression in green algae.

Background
Plastic pollution is one of the most important environ -
mental issues in the world. In 2014, it was estimated 
that up to 51 trillion pieces (236 kilotons) of microplas -
tic float in the world’s oceans [1, 2] and that much larger 
amounts of plastic will continue to flow into the oceans 
[3, 4]. Recent meta-analysis studies have shown that 
polyethylene (PE), polyester and acrylics (PP&A), poly
-
propylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) are the most abun -
dantly present plastics in aquatic systems [5, 6]. A major 
problem is that most plastics cannot be degraded natu -
rally. Once plastics are discarded into the environment, 
they are broken into small-sized fragments by abiotic 
stresses, and are left to accumulate for millions of years 
[7, 8].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a very common 
plastic. It is mainly used to make beverage bottles because 
of its impact resistance, light weight, and high clarity [9]. 
Due to its outstanding mechanical properties and stabil
-
ity, PET consumption has increased for the decades. In

2019, the global PET market was 39.8 billion USD and it 
was expected to reach 51 billion in 2024 with a CAGR of 
about 4.2% [10]. According to the increase of consump
-
tion, PET waste has become a large portion of plastic pol-
lution. In response, different strategies to treat or recycle 
the PET have been investigated. For example, mechanical 
processes for PET separation or chemical processes for 
PET decomposition were reported, and it led the increase 
of gross PET recycling rate [11–13]. However, only clean 
PET wastes without the residual foods or dregs are able 
to be treated by the processes, thus the recycling rate has 
been rather decreased in recent several years [14]. Cur
-
rently, most of non-recyclable PET wastes are inciner -
ated, then a large amount of air pollutant such as  CO2 is 
emitted during this process [14–16]. Therefore, the bio -
logical treatments for plastic waste have been attracting 
attention. To date, scientists have verified 27 enzymes 
that degrade synthetic polymers or oligomers [17], and 
most of the enzymes were lipase, cutinase, and esterase 
[18, 19]. However, in many cases, plastic degradation is 
not occurred by single enzyme: multiple enzymes and 
metabolic pathways have to be utilized [14, 20–22].
In 2016, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which can 
degrade and use PET as a sole carbon source, was iso
-
lated from PET waste [23]. Researchers identified two 
novel enzymes from I. sakaiensis 201-F6: PET hydrolase 
(PETase) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid 
hydrolase (MHETase), both of which demonstrate PET-
degrading activity. These enzymes hydrolyze PET into 
non-toxic monomers (e.g., terephthalic acid (TPA), eth
-
ylene glycol (EG)) [23, 24]. After the discovery of PETase, 
many studies have been performed in order to verify its 
structure and enhance its activity [24–27]. Additionally, 
production of PETase was studied in bacterial systems for 
its potential application in biological PET recycling [16, 
28, 29]. Bacterial systems offer various advantages for the 
production of PETase: high growth rate, low cost, easi
-
ness of manipulation, well-established genetic tools, etc. 
However, bacteria may also be considered as a pollutant 
because of endotoxins or needing a rich carbon source 
for growth. Moreover, the rapid growth of bacteria is 
another threat if it flows into the environment.
Microalgae is much more suitable for environmental 
applications because they do not require organic carbon 
sources under photoautotrophic conditions and usually 
do not have endotoxins [30]. For these reasons, a diatom, 
Phaeodactylum tricornutum was utilized for the produc
-
tion of PETase recently. PETase was secreted by using P. 
tricornutum as a host, and enzymatic activity was dem -
onstrated through the liquid chromatography and elec -
tron microscopy [31]. However, P. tricornutum requires 
low temperatures, silica as a nutrient, and high salinity 
to grow. These features limit the scope of application, so 
an alternative microalgal host is needed to be utilized for 
producing PETase.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular, photosyn
-
thetic microorganism that has diverse advantages as a 
model organism [32–34]. Because C. reinhardtii is con
-
sidered to be ‘generally recognized as safe (GRAS)’ , it is 
suitable for environmentally-friendly applications. In this 
study, we focused on functional expression of PETase in 
C. reinhardtii. To generate a stable transformant, two 
C. reinhardtii strains were compared. After transforma
-
tion, the expression of PETase was confirmed by west -
ern blotting. The activity of PETase was demonstrated 
quantitatively and qualitatively through the high per
-
formance liquid chromatography and scanning electron 
microscopy.
Results
Transformation of microalgae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-124 (mt− [137c]) is 
a common laboratory wild-type strain, which carries 
the nit1 and nit2 mutations and is usually used for gene 
transformation. C. reinhardtii CC-503 (cw92 mt+) is a 
cell wall-less mutant of CC-125 developed for efficient 
transformation. In this study, we examined these two 
strains for transformation and expression of the PETase 
gene. Codon-optimized PETase gene was substituted 
for the mCherry gene of pBR9_mCherry_Cre (resulting 
in pBR9_PETase_Cre), which is a high-strength expres
-
sion vector for C. reinhardtii with the Sh-Ble-2A fusion 
expression system (Fig.  1) [35, 36]. By using this plasmid 
(pBR9_PETase_Cre), two strains were transformed via 
electroporation. The cells were spread on an agar plate 
containing Zeocin. The antibiotic-resistant colonies were 
obtained from each plate, and then 288 colonies were 
inoculated and cultivated in 96-well plates. After culti
-
vation in the 96-well plates, 61 clones of CC-124 and 17 
clones of CC-503 were grown with TAP medium contain
-
ing 10 mg/L Zeocin. The grown cells were transferred to 
24-well plates, followed by 12-well plate cultivations. 11 
clones of CC-124 and 14 clones of CC-503 were grown 
in 12-well plates, and then the clones were cultivated 
in 10  mL of media in a T-25 flask. 5 out of 11 CC-124 
clones (#1, 6, 7, 10 and 11) were well-grown, while 7 out 
of 14 clones of CC-503 (#12, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25) 
grew well (Fig.  2a, b). To confirm the gene integration 
of well-grown C. reinhardtii, polymerase chain reac
-
tion (PCR) was carried out by using Cre_Sh-ble_PETase 
F and R primers. All of the selected clones of CC-124 
transformants showed bands of the correct size (727-bp) 
(Fig. 2c). 6 out of 7 CC-503 clones showed the bands of 
the correct size (Fig.  2d). Although CC-503 clone #12 
demonstrated growth under the Zeocin-supplemented

condition, the 727-bp band was not detected, even in 
repeated experiments.
Expression of PETase in the microalgae
To confirm the expression of PETase, western blot anal -
ysis was performed with the selected clones. For the 
CC-124 transformants, the cells were cultivated for 5 days 
and then used for protein sampling. All five of the clones 
expressed PETase (Fig.  3a). Clones #1 and #11 showed 
the lowest and highest expression level, respectively. The 
expression levels of each clone were retained consistently 
in repeated experiments. In contrast, all of the CC-503 
transformants showed very slow and poor growth, thus 
requiring more than 2  weeks of cultivation to obtain 
the minimum amount of cells for protein sampling. In 
a western blot, faint bands appeared, but the size was 
incorrect. In addition, repeated experiments showed 
slightly different results, but no clear bands. Taking these 
results into consideration, we concluded that CC-124 is 
more appropriate for PETase expression. Clone #11 was 
selected as a final transformant and was used for the rest 
of the experiments.
Validation of PETase activity against a PET bottle
We have demonstrated that C. reinhardtii CC-124_
PETase #11 expressed PETase at the highest level of the 
clones that were evaluated. To investigate whether the 
PETase produced by CC-124_PETase #11 exhibits activ
-
ity against commercial PET bottles, two experiments 
were designed and performed (Fig. 4a).
For the first experiment, PET powder was pre
-
pared by scraping a commercial PET beverage bottle 
with sandpaper. The cell lysates of wild-type CC-124 
and CC-124_PETase #11 supplemented with a pro
-
tease inhibitor cocktail were prepared at 4  mg/mL of 
total protein. The PET powder and each lysate were 
combined in 1.5  mL screw-cap tubes, and allowed to 
incubate at 30 °C for 2 weeks. After incubation, super
-
natants of each lysate were collected and HPLC analy -
sis was performed. The lysates of wild-type CC-124 
and CC-124_PETase #11 showed no peaks of mono
-
mers such as MHET, BHET, or TPA (Fig.  4b). For fur -
ther analysis, the same experiment was performed 
with 3 weeks of incubation. In the HPLC results, only 
the CC-124_PETase #11 lysate showed the peak of 
BHET, which is degraded form of PET (Fig.  4c). After 
4 weeks, a TPA peak was observed in HPLC analysis of

CC-124_PETase #11 lysate (Fig.  4d). For the quantita -
tive analysis, the peak area of TPA was calculated. As a 
result, it was found that 9.12 mg of TPA was generated 
from 30 mg of PET powder. Considering stoichiometry, 
the conversion rate was 35.17%.
For the second experiment, 2  cm × 1  cm PET films 
were prepared and allowed to incubate at 30  °C with 
each cell lysate for 2 and 4 weeks. After incubation, the 
surfaces of the PET films were analyzed with scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the activ
-
ity of PETase. Two weeks of incubation did not cause 
any structural changes on the surface of the PET film 
(Fig.  5b); this is in accordance with the results of the 
first experiment. In contrast, many holes and dents 
appeared after 4  weeks of incubation with CC-124_
PETase #11 cell lysate (Fig.  5c), whereas wild-type cell 
lysate did not affect the surface structure of the film 
(Fig.  5a). The supernatant of 4th week CC-124_PETase 
#11 lysate, which was incubated with the PET film, 
was also analyzed using HPLC and a TPA peak was 
observed.
Discussion
The discovery of PETase from I. sakaiensis was a vital 
breakthrough in plastic biodegradation research. Since 
then, numerous studies have been carried out and 
much progress has been made [27, 29, 37]. Structural 
and functional insights into plastic degrading enzymes 
obtained by current studies on PETase would be of 
great help in further research of other plastics (e.g., 
PP , PE, PS). However, despite these advances, little 
research has been done on the application of plastic 
degrading enzymes to the environment. Microalgae is 
an attractive host for plastic degrading enzyme pro
-
duction and environmental applications because they 
already live in almost every water system, usually do 
not produce endotoxins, and grow without needing 
organic carbon supplementation. In 2019, PETase pro

was successfully demonstrated [31]. This report dem -
onstrated the possibility of functional production of 
PETase in microalgae by using P. tricornutum, which 
is a representative model species of diatom. However, 
in general, P. tricornutum grows poorly compared 
to green algae species such as Chlamydomonas and 
Chlorella [ 38–40]. Thus, we chose C. reinhardtii as an 
alternative host, since the species grows quickly and is 
a freshwater microalga.
In the previous study, PETase produced from P. tri
-
cornutum showed a single peak of fully-degraded PET 
(TPA), after 10  days of culture [31]. The degradation 
was much faster than that of the C. reinhardtii deriva
-
tives used in this study, which only showed chemical 
and morphological changes after 4  weeks. In the P. 
tricornutum study, PETase was secreted into the cul
-
ture medium. Therefore, the PETase would not be 
affected by endogenous proteases or other compo
-
nents, whereas in our study, the enzyme was exposed 
to these factors due to cell lysis. Despite of the slow 
reaction, we demonstrated that C. reinhardtii-derived 
PETase catalyzed PET with a high conversion rate. 
Considering that the inner side of PET bottle was 
coated and the bottle we used contained yellowish pig
-
ment, we believe that the conversion rate of about 35% 
was enough to address the potential. In addition, intra
-
cellular expression of PETase in C. reinhardtii may be 
beneficial for the specific application. For instance, 
PETase expressed in intact cells can be used to feed 
zooplanktons or fish to control the bioconcentration 
of microplastic. Also, in the P. tricornutum study, an 
activity-improved mutant, R280A, was used, so the 
degradation of PETase occurred much faster. If the 
R280A mutant is used for further studies, it will be 
helpful for enhancing the catalytic activity of PETase.
Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the functional expression 
of PETase in a model green microalga, C. reinhardtii. 
Catalytic activity of PETase was proven by detecting TPA 
(i.e. the fully degraded form of PET) via HPLC analysis. 
Additionally, morphological changes on the surface of 
PET film after PETase treatment was observed by elec
-
tron microscopy. These results suggest that microalgae 
are a potential biological treatment strategy for plastic 
pollution, especially in freshwater and terrestrial envi
-
ronments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
reported success of PETase production in green microal
-
gae. We believe that this study offers a standard for bio -
logical degradation of plastics by using green microalgae 
or other photosynthetic eukaryotes.
Methods
Plasmid construction, strains, and cell cultivation
All plasmids, oligonucleotide primers, and strains used in 
this study are listed in Table  1. The amino acid sequence 
of PETase (ISF6_4831) was obtained from UniProt 
(http://www.unipr ot.org/). To obtain pIDT_PETase_Opt 
from a commercial service (Integrated DNA Technolo
-
gies Inc. (IDT), Coralville, IA, USA), the amino acid 
sequence of PETase was reverse-translated, codon-
optimized for C. reinhardtii, and synthesized by using 
the resulting pIDT_PETase_Opt. The codon-optimized 
PETase-encoding gene was digested and cloned into 
pBR9_mCherry_Cre (Chlamydomonas Resource Center 
(CRC), Saint Paul, MN, USA) by using XhoI and Bam HI 
restriction endonucleases, generating pBR9_PETase_Cre.

In all of the gene cloning, maintenance, and ampli -
fication experiments, Escherichia coli DH5α was used 
and cultured at 37  °C with shaking (200  rpm). The cul -
ture medium was formulated using liquid LB broth (BD, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with an appro
-
priate concentration of antibiotics (100 mg/L ampicillin). 
For the transformation of PETase gene, expression confir
-
mation, and plastic degradation, microalgal strains were 
used. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-124 (mt− [137c]) 
and CC-503 (cw92 mt+) were purchased from CRC and 
cultured at 25 °C with shaking (120 rpm). For cell cultiva
-
tion, light intensity was maintained at 100 μmol/m2/s and 
the culture medium was composed of tris–acetate-phos -
phate (TAP) medium [41] supplemented with antibiotics 
(10  mg/L Zeocin). Standard procedures were followed 
for all experiments including DNA manipulations and 
gene cloning [42].
Transformation and clone selection
For gene cloning, the ligated plasmid (PETase gene from 
pIDT_PETase_Opt + pBR9_mCherry_Cre) was trans
-
formed into E. coli DH5α by using commercial heat 
shock competent cells (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, 
Taiwan). The heat-shocked cells were spread on LB-agar 
plates (BD) containing 100 mg/L Ampicillin and the cor
-
rect clones were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) and DNA sequencing. From the final E. coli clone, 
pBR9_PETase_Cre plasmid was purified from the 300 mL 
culture solution by using Nucleobond Xtra Midi Plus 
(Macherey–Nagel, Bethlehem, PA, USA) for the transfor
-
mation of microalgae.
Competent cells of C. reinhardtii CC-124 and CC-503 
were prepared by using MAX ™ Efficiency Transfor -
mation Reagent for Algae (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA). Each 400 µL of competent cells containing 10  µg 
of pBR9_PETase_Cre (linearized by Psi I) was subjected 
to electroporation by using 0.4  cm MicroPulser Elec
-
troporation Cuvettes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The 
electroporation was performed with Gene Pulser Xcell 
Electroporation systems under the conditions of 500  V, 
50 μF, and 800 Ω. After the pulse, 10 mL of TAP medium 
supplemented with 40 mM of sucrose was added to the 
cells immediately, and the cells were recovered for 16  h 
at 25 °C with shaking (80 rpm) under low light. The cells 
were plated on TAP-agar plates containing 10  mg/L 
Zeocin. Hundreds of colonies from the TAP-agar plates 
were inoculated into 96-well plates with 150 µL TAP 
medium containing 10  mg/L Zeocin. After cultivation, 
cells in green-colored wells were transferred to 24-well 
and 12-well plates sequentially using the aforementioned 
conditions. For the selection of stable transformants, the 
cells from 12-well plates were cultured with 10 mL TAP 
medium in a T-flask. The well-grown cells were chosen 
as the final clones. To verify the PETase gene integration 
into the nuclear genome of C. reinhardtii, the genomic 
DNA of the final clones was extracted via boiling with 
specific solution (1  M KCl, 10  mM EDTA, 100  mM of 
Tris–HCl, pH 9.5) for subsequent PCR analysis. For the 
PCR analysis, PETase_Sh-ble_Cre F and R primers were 
used (Table 1).
SDS‑PAGE and western blot analysis
To analyze protein expression, algal cells were harvested 
by centrifugation at 6000  rpm. To extract protein, the 
cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer supplemented 
with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO, USA) and disrupted by bead-beating with 
0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads for 5 min. Protein concen
-
tration of lysates were determined using the Pierce BCA 
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA). The samples (50 μg/sample) were separated 
on 4-20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX
™ Precast Protein Gel 
(Bio-Rad) according to standard SDS-PAGE procedure 
[42]. The gels were transferred onto a PVDF membrane 
using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). 
After transfer, the membrane was incubated with block
-
ing solution (5% skim milk solution with 1× TBS-T) 
at room temperature for an hour. The membrane was 
then incubated with blocking solution supplemented 
with 1:5000-diluted mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal 
antibody (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 1  h. 
After antibody binding, the membrane was washed with 
1× TBS-T four times (20  min/wash). To visualize the 
bands, the membrane was treated with ECL
™ Prime (GE 
Healthcare, IL, USA) and the chemiluminescent signal 
was detected using a FUSION Solo (Vilber Lourmat, Col
-
legien, France) imaging system.
Catalytic activity assay of PETase
To analyze the catalytic activity of PETase produced 
from C. reinhardtii, a commercial PET beverage bot
-
tle (PepsiCo., NY, USA) was used as the substrate. The 
PET powder for HPLC analysis was prepared by grind
-
ing the bottle with sandpaper. The ground PET was 
filtered using a sieve to remove large fragments. The 
PET films for electron microscopy were prepared by 
cutting a PET bottle into 2 cm × 1 cm fragments. Wild-
type C. reinhardtii CC-124 and CC-124_PETase #11 
were cultivated and harvested to obtain cell lysates. 
The harvested cells were resuspended in 1×  PBS and 
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Aldrich). The solu
-
tion was disrupted by sonication on ice for 20 min with 
3 s pulses at 7 s intervals (VC750; Sonics & Materials, 
Newtown, CT, USA). After the preparation of all mate
-
rials, PET powder and films were incubated with 1 mL 
and 5  mL of the cell lysates, respectively. All of the 
Page 8 of 9Kim et al. Microb Cell Fact           (2020) 19:97 
reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 4 weeks, 
changing the cell lysate to fresh one weekly to prevent 
contamination and PETase degradation. At each time 
point, the solutions were combined and subjected to 
HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was performed using 
an HPLC System
™ (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) 
equipped with a diode array detector. A C18 column 
(ZORBAX RR Eclipse Plus C18, 95 Å, 4.6 × 150  mm, 
3.5 µm; Agilent Technologies) was used and the signals 
were detected at 240 nm. The mobile phase was com
-
prised of 50 mM phosphoric acid and methanol. Chro -
matography was performed using a methanol gradient 
(0 min 20% methanol, 2 min 20% methanol, 12 min 40% 
methanol, 20  min 20% methanol; flow rate of 0.5  mL/
min) at 40 °C.
Scanning electron microscopy analysis
After incubation with algal lysates, PET films were 
washed with distilled and deionized water and dried for 
an hour. The PET samples were cut into a compact size 
(< 25  mm
2) and were attached to the top of aluminum 
specimen stubs. They were then sputtered with a piece 
of double-sided metal sticky tape and gold-coated under 
vacuum using a sputter coater (Q15ORS; Quorum, UK). 
The samples were analyzed using a scanning electron 
microscope (FEI Quanta 250 FEG, FEI) at 10 kV.
