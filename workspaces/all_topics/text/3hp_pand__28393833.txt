production of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase 
from Azospirillum brasilense

3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform chemical to be converted to acrylic acid 
and acrylamide. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of 
3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) to 3-HP , determines 3-HP production rate during the conversion of 
glycerol to 3-HP . To elucidate molecular mechanism of 3-HP production, we determined the first crystal 
structure of a 3-HP producing ALDH, α-ketoglutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Azospirillum 
basilensis (AbKGSADH), in its apo-form and in complex with NAD
+. Although showing an overall 
structure similar to other ALDHs, the AbKGSADH enzyme had an optimal substrate binding site for 
accepting 3-HPA as a substrate. Molecular docking simulation of 3-HPA into the AbKGSADH structure 
revealed that the residues Asn159, Gln160 and Arg163 stabilize the aldehyde- and the hydroxyl-groups 
of 3-HPA through hydrogen bonds, and several hydrophobic residues, such as Phe156, Val286, Ile288, 
and Phe450, provide the optimal size and shape for 3-HPA binding. We also compared AbKGSADH 
with other reported 3-HP producing ALDHs for the crucial amino acid residues for enzyme catalysis 
and substrate binding, which provides structural implications on how these enzymes utilize 3-HPA as a 
substrate.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is one of top twelve value-added platform chemicals which can be produced 
from renewable biomass products
1. 3-HP has diverse industrial applications in the production of such chemicals 
as acrylic acid, acrylamide, ethyl 3-HP , 3-hydroxymethyl-propionate, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, malonic acid, 
methylacrylate, 1,3-propanediol, propiolactone, and 3-HP- or acryl-based polymers
1–3.
To date, two biosynthetic routes using glycerol or glucose as carbon substrate have been extensively studied 
for industrial production of 3-HP . With glucose as carbon source, 3-HP can be produced via  malonyl-CoA or 
β -alanine4–6. With glycerol as substrate, glycerol is converted to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) by coen-
zyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase (DhaB) and 3-HPA is then converted to 3-HP by NAD +-dependent 
aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) (Fig. 1a) 7,8. The route using glycerol as the carbon source is advantageous 
because the pathway is simple and cheap glycerol is abundantly available as a waste by product from biodiesel 
industry
9–13.
Since 2008, eight 3-HP producing ALDHs have been characterized and these enzymes include DhaS 
from Bacillus subtilis  (BsDhaS) 14, GapD4 from Cupriavidus necator  (CnGapD4) 15, AldH from Escherichia 
coli  ( EcAldH) 16, PuuC from Klebsiella pneumonia  ( KpPuuC) 17, Y dcW from Klebsiella pneumonia  
(KpY dcW), YneI from Klebsiella pneumonia (KpYneI)18, Ald4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (ScAld4)19, and 
α -ketoglutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Azospirillum basilensis (AbKGSADH)20 (Fig. 1b). However 
none of them use 3-HPA as the physiological substrate. Thus, these ALDHs show low enzymatic activity, thus 
the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP is considered the rate-limiting step for the production of 3-HPA from glycerol. 
Furthermore, low ALDH activity has been reported to cause intracellular accumulation of highly toxic 3-HPA

and this seriously hamper the cell growth and 3-HP production as well 21–25. Although some studies to screen 
better ALDHs or to improve the existing ALDHs by protein engineering have been conducted, poor performance 
of ALDH still remains a significant challenge for successful 3-HP production26.
The ALDH family enzymes have been extensively studied and several crystal structures of ALDHs have 
also been determined. Amino acid sequence and structure analysis of various ALDHs revealed that this family

of enzymes have different substrate specificities, although the overall structures of the enzymes are very sim-
ilar. Among the eight ALDHs which have been tested for the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP , Ab KGSADH was 
first discovered as an enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of α  -ketoglutarate-semialdehyde (α  -KGSA) 
to α -ketoglutarate (α -KG) in an alternative pathway of L-arabinose metabolism 27. In comparative studies, 
AbKGSADH was identified as a highly efficient enzyme for the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP 20. However, the 
crystal structures of 3-HP producing ALDH, including AbKGSADH have not yet been reported, and the struc-
tural features that determine its 3-HPA binding ability have been veiled.
Here, we report the first crystal structure of the 3-HP producing ALDH from A. basilensis (AbKGSADH) in its 
apo-form and in complex with NAD+ cofactor. On the basis of the docking simulation of 3-HPA binding to the 
AbKGSADH active site and pertinent biochemical studies, we reveal the structural features of substrate specificity 
3-HPA. We also analyzed the amino acids that constitute the substrate binding pockets of known 3-HP producing 
ALDHs. These studies may provide valuable structural information for the development of engineered ALDHs 
with high 3-HP producing activity.
Results and Discussion
Overall structure of AbKGSADH. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of 3-HP producing ALDHs, we 
determined the crystal structure of AbKGSADH at a 2.25 Å resolution. The refined structure was in good agree-
ment with the X-ray crystallographic statistics for bond angles, bond lengths, and other geometric parameters 
(Table 1). The overall structure of AbKGSADH shows a conventional conformation for the ALDH fold. The mon-
omeric structure of AbKGSADH consists of three domains: two core domains and one oligomerization domain 
(OGD) (Fig. 2a). The core domains consist of the N-terminal domain (NTD) (Met1-Arg123 and Val145-Leu253) 
and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Gly254-Pro469). The NTD is composed of seven α -helices (α 1–α 7) and nine 
β -strands (β 1–β 4 and β 7–β 11), and forms the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold, where seven β  -strands (β 1–β 2 
and β 7–β 11) form a large β -sheet packed in the middle of the domain and other two β -strands (β 3–β 4) are located 
on the surface of the domain. The three α -helices (α 1, α 6 and α 7) and the four α -helices (α 2–α 5) occupy both 
sides of the central β -sheet (Fig. 2a). The CTD consists of seven α -helices (α 8–α 14) and seven β -strands (β 12–β 
18). Seven β -strands are also packed as a large β -sheet in the middle of the domain. Six α -helices surround the 
central β -sheet and one α -helix (α 14) is located between the NTD and the OGD. The OGD (Val124-Pro144 and 
Tyr470-Val481) has two long β -strands (β 6 and β 19) and one short β -strand (β 5), which are packed in a line and 
protrude from the NTD (Fig. 2a).
As observed in many other ALDH structures, Ab KGSADH forms a tetramer. Although there are two 
AbKGSADH molecules in the asymmetric unit of our present structures, the tetrameric structure can be easily 
generated by one of the two folds from the P4
322 crystallographic symmetry operation (Fig. 2b). Dimerization

is mainly mediated by the OGD and the CTD of Ab KGSADH. Three β  -strands in the OGD and a β  -sheet in 
the middle of the CTD form big β -sheet, and tetramerization of AbKGSADH is mediated by the OGD and two 
α -helices (α 2, α 3) (Fig. 2b). Using the PISA software28, we calculated that a 5028.9 Å2 area of solvent accessible 
interface per monomer is buried, and the percentage of participating residues is 20.9%.
NAD+ binding mode of AbKGSADH. Previous research has indicated that the ALDH family of enzymes 
utilize NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor29. First, to identify the cofactor specificity of AbKGSADH, we performed an 
ALDH activity assay using NAD+ and NADP+. AbKGSADH showed less than 10% ALDH activity when NADP+ 
was used as a cofactor as compared to that when NAD+ was used (Fig. 3a). This result indicates that AbKGSADH 
utilizes NAD+ as a cofactor instead of NADP+. To elucidate the cofactor binding mode of AbKGSADH, we then 
determined the crystal structure of the protein in complex with NAD+ at a 2.6 Å resolution (Fig. 3b). The NAD+ 
cofactor is bound to an inter-domain space between the NTD and the CTD (Fig. 3c). The NAD+-binding pocket is 
constituted by seven loops (β 7–α 4, β 8–α 5, β 10–α 7, β 11–β 12, α 8–β 13, α 9–α 10, and α 11–β 16) and four α -helices 
(α 4, α 6, α 7, and α 10). The adenine ring is stabilized in the hydrophobic pocket that is formed by Phe151, Pro211, 
Ala212, Phe229, Val235 and Leu239, and a hydrogen bond with Ser215 also contributes to the binding of the ring. 
Residues Lys178, Glu181, and Pro211 constitute a suitable space for binding of the ribose ring, and stabilize the 
2′ -hydroxyl-group of the ring (Fig. 3d). The formation of the ribose ring binding site does not seem to be large 
enough to accommodate the phosphorylated ribose ring. This observation indicates that Ab KGSADH cannot

utilize NADP+ as a cofactor, which is consistent with the results mentioned above. The pyrophosphate moiety 
is stabilized by residues Asn331, Arg333, and Arg334 through directly and water-mediated hydrogen bond net-
works. Residues Arg334 and Glu384 stabilize the ribose moiety of NAD+, and the nicotinamide ring is stabilized 
by residues Gln160 and Glu253 by hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3e).
Substrate binding mode of Ab KGSADH. AbKGSADH is known to utilize both α -ketoglutarate-  
semialdehyde (α  -KGSA) and succinate-semialdehyde (SSA) as substrates 27. To elucidate how Ab KGSADH 
accommodates these substrates, we performed molecular docking simulations of AbKGSADH with α -KGSA and 
SSA. The molecular docking simulations revealed that these two substrates fit well into the somewhat positively 
charged substrate binding pocket (Fig. 4a). The aldehyde-groups of these substrates, which are the sites of enzyme 
reaction, are located in the same place around the catalytic residues (Fig. 4a). The aldehyde-group of α -KGSA is 
stabilized by Gln160 and Arg163 through hydrogen bonds, and two catalytic residues, Glu253 and Cys287, also 
assist the binding of the molecule (Fig. 4b). The 4′ -keto-group of α -KGSA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with 
Arg281, and the carboxyl-group of the molecule is stabilized by Glu106 and Gln160. The substrate binding pocket 
is also formed by several hydrophobic residues, such as Phe156, Val286, Ile288, Pro444, and Phe450, which seem 
to contribute to the stabilization of the hydrophobic part of α -KGSA (Fig. 4b). The binding of SSA is similar to 
that of α -KGSA, however, the stabilization of the carboxyl-group of SSA is quite different. Arg281, a residue that 
is involved in the stabilization of the 4′ -keto-group of α -KGSA, forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl-group

of SSA instead (Fig. 4c). These observations explain how AbKGSADH can accommodate both α -KGSA and SSA 
as real substrates.
3-HPA binding mode of AbKGSADH. To elucidate the 3-HPA binding mode of Ab KGSADH, we 
attempted to determine the crystal structure of AbKGSADH in complex with 3-HPA substrate or the 3-HP prod-
uct, however, both cocrystallization and soaking experiments were unsuccessful. The molecular docking sim-
ulation of AbKGSADH with 3-HPA did allow us to speculate how Ab KGSADH accommodates an unnatural 
substrate 3-HPA. The 3-HPA molecule is bound at the same position as the α -KGSA and SSA molecules (Fig. 4a). 
Moreover, the aldehyde-group of 3-HPA is located in the same position as those of α -KGSA and SSA, and is sta-
bilized by the same residues (Fig. 4a). The 3′ -hydroxyl-group of 3-HPA is stabilized by residues Asn159, Gln160, 
and Arg163 through hydrogen bonds, and of these three residues, Gln160 and Arg163 are also involved in the 
binding of the aldehyde-group of 3-HPA (Fig. 4d). As observed in the binding of α -KGSA and SSA, hydrophobic 
residues, such as Phe156, Val286, Ile288, and Phe450, seem to also contribute to stabilization of the hydrophobic 
part of 3-HPA (Fig. 4d). One interesting observation is that Arg281, which is a crucial residue for the bind-
ing of α -KGSA and SSA, is located distal from the bound 3-HPA and does not participate in its stabilization 
(Fig. 4d). We speculate that this observation is derived from the fact that 3-HPA has two and one fewer carbon 
than α -KGSA and SSA, respectively.
To confirm the involvement of these residues in the enzyme catalysis and the binding of the 3-HPA sub-
strate, we then performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments. First, we mutated the two catalytic residues, 
Glu253 and Cys287, to alanine residues, and observed that these mutants exhibited an almost complete loss of 
enzyme activity (Fig. 4e), indicating that AbKGSADH has the same enzymatic mechanism as other ALDH family 
enzymes. Second, we mutated residues that form hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde- and hydroxyl-group of 
3-HPA to alanine residues. The AbKGSADH
R163A mutant showed 90% of the enzyme activity that was present 
with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4e), and the result indicates that 3-HPA can be stabilized sufficiently by hydrogen 
bonding with other residues even without Arg163. Interestingly, the AbKGSADH
N159A and the AbKGSADHQ160A 
mutants showed approximately 30% higher enzyme activities than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4e). These results 
imply that there is no significant issue in stabilizing 3-HPA even if one of the hydrogen bonding residues is absent, 
as observed in the Ab KGSADH
R163A mutant. Rather, substitutions of Asn159 and Gln160 to alanine seem to 
increase the hydrophobicity of the substrate binding site and consequently increased the stabilization of 3-HPA. 
Finally, we mutated residues involved in the constitution of the hydrophobic substrate binding site to alanine res-
idues. All of these mutants, AbKGSADH
F156A, AbKGSADHV286A, AbKGSADHI288A, and AbKGSADHF450A, exhib-
ited decreased or complete loss of activities compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4e). We propose that the 
formation of substrate binding sites with optimal size and shape by these hydrophobic residues is very important 
for accommodating 3-HPA as a substrate.
Comparison of 3-HP producing ALDHs. So far, eight 3-HP producing ALDHs, including AbKGSADH, 
have been reported. To structurally analyse how these enzymes utilize 3-HPA as a substrate, we compared the key 
residues of AbKGSADH in enzyme catalysis and substrate binding for 3-HPA with those of the other seven 3-HP 
producing ALDHs (Fig. 1b, Table 2). The amino acid sequence similarities within eight 3-HP producing ALDHs 
are 31% to 83%, and those between AbKGSADH and the other seven 3-HP producing ALDHs are 32% to 50%. 
As expected, the two catalytic residues, Glu253 and Cys287, in AbKGSADH are completely conserved in all 3-HP 
producing ALDHs. However, the three residues involved in the stabilization of the aldehyde- and hydroxyl-group 
of 3-HPA, Asn159, Gln160, and Arg163 in AbKGSADH, are variable in other 3-HP producing ALDHs (Fig. 1b, 
Table 2). Combined with the previously described results that mutations of these residues to alanine did not sig-
nificantly affect enzyme activity, we propose that, for the stabilization of the aldehyde- and hydroxyl-groups of 
3-HPA, the combination of several residues rather than a particular residue is important. Interestingly, the four 
hydrophobic residues forming the hydrophobic pockets, Phe156, Val286, Ile288, and Phe450 in AbKGSADH, are 
highly conserved throughout all 3-HP producing ALDHs (Fig. 1b, Table 2). As described above, a single amino 
acid mutation of any of these four hydrophobic residues to alanine showed decreased or almost complete loss of 
enzyme activity (Fig. 4e). Taken together, we propose that formation of hydrophobic pockets with optimal size 
and shape is critical for 3-HP producing ALDHs to accept 3-HPA as a substrate.

In summary, we report the first crystal structure of the 3-HP producing ALDH, Ab KGSADH, and provide 
structural insight into how the 3-HP producing ALDHs utilize the unnatural substrate 3-HPA. For accepting 
3-HPA, the location of the appropriate residues for hydrogen bonding to the aldehyde- and the hydroxyl-groups 
of 3-HPA is important. Moreover, a hydrophobic pocket with optimal size and shape to bind the hydrophobic 
portion of 3-HPA is also critical. This structural information might be used for developing 3-HP producing 
ALDHs that possess a higher 3-HP production activity.
Methods
Cloning, expression and purification of AbKGSADH. The AbKGSADH coding gene was amplified 
through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic gene in a pBHA vector by Bioneer. The PCR products 
were digested by NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes, and sub-cloned into the pProEX-HTa expression vector 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) which contained a 6xHis tag and rTEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminus of 
the target protein. The pProEX-HTa:AbKGSADH was transformed into a E. coli BL21(DE3)-T1
R strain, which 
was grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium containing 100 mg L−1 ampicillin at 310 K and AbKGSADH pro-
tein expression was induced by 0.5 mM 1-thio-β -D-galatopyranoside (IPTG). After 20  h at 293 K, the cell were 
harvested by centrifugation at 4,000×   g for 15 min at 277 K. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer 
A (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation 
at 13,000 g for 30 min, and the lysate was applied onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with 
buffer B (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 25 mM Imidazole), the bound proteins were eluted with buffer C (40 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 300 mM Imidazole). Finally, trace amounts of contaminants were removed by size-exclusive 
chromatography using Sephacryl S-300 prep-grade column (320 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. 
The eluted protein had a molecular weight of about 200 kDa, indicating a tetrameric structure. The protein was 
concentrated to 50 mg mL−1 using a spin column (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 30 kDa pore size), and kept at 
193 K for further experiments. All purification steps were performed at 277 K.
Crystallization and data collection of AbKGSADH. Crystallization of the purified AbKGSADH protein 
was initially tried with commercially available sparse-matrix screens, including Index, PEG ion I and II (Hampton 
Research), and Wizard Classic I and II (Rigaku Reagents), using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method on the 
MRC Crystallization plates (Molecular Dimensions) at 295 K. Each experiment consisted of mixing 1.0 μ L protein 
solution (60 mg mL
−1, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) with 1.0 μ L reservoir solution and then equilibrating against 50 μ 
L reservoir solution. AbKGSADH crystals were observed from several crystallization screening conditons. After 
several steps of crystal improvement, the best quality crystals appeared in 16% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M 
sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, and 0.2 M Magnesium chloride hexahydrate. The crystals were transferred to cryo-
protectant solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 0.2 M Magnesium 
chloride hexahydrate, and 30% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals were fished out with a loop larger than the crystals 
and flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Data were collected to a maximum resolution on the 
detector of 2.18 Å at 7A beamline of the Pohang Acclerator Laboratory (PAL, Pohang, Korea), using a Quantum 
270 CCD detector (ADSC, USA). All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled together using the HKL2000 
software package
30. The crystals of Ab KGSADH belonged to the space group P4 322 with unit cell parameters 
a =  b =  129.12 Å, c =  118.12 Å, α  =  β  =  γ  =  90° Assuming two AbKGSADH molecules in asymmetric unit, the 
crystal volume per unit of protein mass was 2.46 Å3 Da−1, which means the solvent content was approximately 
50%31.
Structure determination of Ab KGSADH. The structure of apo-form of Ab KGSADH was determined 
by molecular replacement with the CCP4 version of MOLREP 32, using the structure of Succinic-semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase (SSADH) from Homo sapiens (PDB code 2W8R) as a search model. Further model building was 
performed manually using the program WinCoot
33, and refinement was performed with CCP4 refmac5 34. The 
structure of AbKGSADH in complex with NAD+ was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure 
of the apo-form of AbKGSADH. The data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The refined model of the apo-form 
of AbKGSADH and that in complex with NAD + were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB codes of 
5X5T and 5X5U, respectively.
Molecular docking simulations of AbKGSADH. Molecular docking simulations of α -KGSA, SSA and 
3-HPA to AbKGSADH structure were performed by AutoDock Vina software35. AbKGSADH structure in com-
plex with NAD+ cofactor (PDB code of 5X5U) and the α  -KGSA, SSA and 3-HPA ligands were prepared using 
the JLigand software. For the docking simulation, the pdbqt files were generated using AutoDock Tools, and all 
steps for simulation and grid box creation were performed according to the AutoDock Vina manual. The grid size 
for α -KGSA was x =  40, y =  50, z =  36, and grid center was designated at x =  − 35.377, y =  − 49.707, z =  − 4.816. 
And the grid size for SSA was x =  28, y =  50, z =  34, and grid center was designated at x =  − 37.77, y =  − 49.853,  
z =  − 4.29. Last, the grid size for 3-HPA was x =  26, y =  32, z =  34, and grid center was designated at x =  − 37.903, 
y =  − 46.826, z  =  − 4.534. The final conformations produced in this simulation were checked using PyMOL 
software.
Activity assay of AbKGSADH. The activity of AbKGSADH was determined by measuring the increase of 
absorbance at 340 nm (extinction coefficient of 6.22 ×  103 M−1 cm−1). Enzyme reaction was performed with a 
reaction mixture of 1 mL total volume at 303 K. The reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM 
3-HPA, and 1 mM NAD(P), and the background rate of the assay in the absence of enzyme is zero. The reaction

was initiated by the addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 200 nM. The AbKGSADH activity assay was 
performed in duplicate reaction.
