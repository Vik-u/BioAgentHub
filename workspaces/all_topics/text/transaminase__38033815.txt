The U.S. Department of Energy has listed levulinic acid (LA) as one of the top
12 compounds derived from biomass. LA has gained much attention owing to its
conversion into enantiopure 4-aminopentanoic acid through an amination
reaction. Herein, we developed a coupled-enzyme recyclable cascade
employing two transaminases (TAs) for the synthesis of (S)-4-aminopentanoic
acid. TAs wereﬁrst utilized to convert LA into (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid using (S)-
α-Methylbenzylamine [(S)-α-MBA] as an amino donor. The deaminated (S)-α-MBA
i.e., acetophenone was recycled back using a second TAs while using isopropyl
amine (IPA) amino donor to generate easily removable acetone. Enzymatic
reactions were carried out using different systems, with conversions ranging
from 30% to 80%. Furthermore, the hybrid nanoﬂowers (HNF) of the fusion
protein were constructed which afforded complete biocatalytic conversion of
LA to the desired (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid. The created HNF demonstrated
storage stability for over a month and can be reused for up to 7 sequential cycles. A
preparative scale reaction (100 mL) achieved the complete conversion with an
isolated yield of 62%. Furthermore, the applicability of this recycling system was
tested with differentβ-keto ester substrates, wherein 18%–48% of corresponding
β-amino acids were synthesized. Finally, this recycling system was applied for the
biosynthesis of pharmaceutical important drug sitagliptin intermediate ((R)-3-
amino-4-(2,4,5-triﬂurophenyl) butanoic acid) with an excellent conversion 82%.

1 Introduction
Biomass has gained increasing attention for the past few decades because of the unique
renewable carbonaceous resource on the earth and is regarded as an alternative resource to
fossil fuels (Changzhi et al., 2015; Mahlet et al., 2020; Yoo et al., 2023). Moreover, biomass
can serve as an exclusive source of carbon-based fuels, specialty chemicals and value-added
chemicals for the Green and sustainable future (Akwasi et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2022).

Amination of biomass is an indispensable process that plays a
pivotal role in the production of a diverse array of ﬁne
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products
(Froidevaux et al., 2016). Traditional organo-catalytic or chemical
processes, however, frequently call for pricey starting materials and/
or transition-metal catalysts, laborious protection and deprotection
stages, and high pressures and/or temperatures (Collet et al., 2009).
Alternatively, biocatalytic processes are advantageous such as
simpler, safer for the environment, more atom-ef ﬁcient, and
highly enantioselective along with some disadvantage like
stability which include inactivation at high temperature, solvents,
pH value, ionic strength, and salt type (Bommarius, 2015; Lin and
Tao, 2017; Patil et al., 2018; Giri et al., 2021; Chook et al., 2023; Lewis
et al., 2023).
Recent years have evidenced a signiﬁcantly increased interest in
the enzymatic synthesis of value-added chemicals from biomass via
amination routes. Enzymes such as transaminases (TAs),
monoamine oxidases, amine dehydrogenases, phenylalanine
ammonia lyases, imine reductases, lipases, P450 monooxygenases,
Pictet-Spenglerases, and berberine bridge enzymes constitute a
proﬁcient pool of biocatalysts for the synthesis of various amines
(Patil et al., 2018b; Murshidul et al., 2018; Giri et al., 2021). In
particular, biocatalytic transaminations are crucial for the synthesis
of nylon monomers, diamines, and furan-based compounds
(Silvianti et al., 2020 ; Zhu and Yin, 2021 ). In comparison to
other enzymes, TAs offer numerous advantages including high
catalytic activity and stereoselectivity, broad substrate speciﬁcity,
and no need for an additional cofactor. Likewise, TAs can kinetically
resolve racemic amines and produce optically pure amines from the
necessary prochiral carbonyl compounds (Hohne and Bornscheuer,
2009; Mathew and Yun, 2012; Guo and Berglund, 2017; Patil et al.,
2018a). For instance, a higher concentration of nylon monomer was
synthesized from renewable fatty acids utilizing a multi-enzyme
cascade employing a TA (Yoo et al., 2022). In another study, anE
coli-based modularization strategy was applied for the synthesis of
1,6-hexamethylenediamine and associated α, ω-diamines from
corresponding cycloalkanols ( Sarak et al., 2023 ). Lee et al.
reported a multi-step biotransformation reaction to produce long
chain aliphatic amines from renewable fatty acids (Cha et al., 2020).
A wild-type amine dehydrogenase that may reductively ameliorate
biobased LA to (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid was recently discovered
by Mayol et al., 2016.H e’s group reported a whole-cell reaction by
employing the transaminase fromChromobacterium violaceumfor
the valorization of biomass-derived 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 5-
Hydroxymethylfurfural amine (Wang et al., 2022).
Despite being potential biocatalysts, the industrial applications
of TAs are often conﬁned by limited operation stability in harsh
reaction conditions such as higher temperatures, acidic or basic pH,
and the presence of organic solvents (Patil et al., 2018). Nano-
biocatalysis primarily concerned with immobilization of enzyme on
nanoscale supports using traditional immobilization techniques
such as physical adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, and
carrier free immobilization. Hybrid organic – inorganic nano-
formulations (NFs) show improved enzymatic activity and
stability compared to free enzymes which may be attributed to
the conﬁnement of the enzyme in the core of the NFs and high-
surface-area (Lv et al., 2020). The combined functionalities of the
protein and the inorganic material of the hybrid NFs enable its
application in biosensors, biofuel cells, and biocatalysis (Li et al.,
2020).
LA has been listed by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of
the top 12 compounds derived from biomass (Figure 1A)( Kang
et al., 2018). LA has gained more attention because of its plausible
conversion into chiral 4-aminopentanoic acid through an amination
reaction (Liu et al., 2022). The optically pure (S)-4-aminopentanoic
acid serves as a pivotal precursor in the synthesis of therapeutic
molecules, pyrrolidinone derivatives and is used as false GABAergic
neurotransmitters (Cai et al., 2020; Wawro et al., 2021; Zhou et al.,
2022). Generally, the chemical conversion of LA into chiral 4-
aminopentanoic acid still suffers from poor stereoselectivity (Wu
et al., 2019). Recent years have witnessed the development of various
biocatalytic approaches to circumvent poor stereoselectivity (Gupta
et al., 2022). Recently, Jiang et al. discovered an (S)-TA that showed
distinct activity toward LA (10 mM) with 66% conversion in a 1 mL
reaction (Jiang et al., 2014). In another study,Mayol et al., 2016.
transformed the 500 mM LA to ( S)-4-aminopentanoic acid
employing a wild-type amine dehydrogenase with 88%
conversion in a 9 mL reaction. After that, Cai et al. used directed
evolution to create an active mutant of amine dehydrogenase with
increased activity, resulting in a successful synthesis of ( S)-4-
aminopentanoic acid by employing 500 mM LA as a substrate
with 97% conversion in a 200 mL reaction (Cai et al., 2020 ).
However, amine dehydrogenases use excess ammonia, which
poses dif ﬁculty in the isolation of ﬁnal products (( S)-4-
aminopentanoic acid) which included the extra steps and
instrument. Moreover, additional enzymes are required for the
recycling of costly cofactors.
We envisaged developing a biocatalytic cascade for the synthesis
of (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid from biobased LA. In this coupled-
enzyme reaction, transaminase was utilized to transform LA into
(S)-4-aminopentanoic acid using (S)-α-MBA as an amino donor.
The deaminated (S)-α-MBA i.e., acetophenone was recycled back
using another transaminase while using isopropyl amine (IPA) as
amino donor to generate easily removable acetone (Figure 1B). To
begin with, we examined a panel of 30 in-house TAs and evaluated
their selectivity towards IPA and (S)-α-MBA. After choosing the
appropriate TAs, we investigate the effectiveness of single- and two-
cell systems for better conversions of LA to (S)-4-aminopentanoic
acid. In addition, we synthesized the nano ﬂ
owers of TA and
subsequently employed them in the enzymatic reactions resulting
in excellent conversions. Furthermore, the preparative scale reaction
was performed with the isolation of the ﬁnal product. The
applicability of this system was tested with differentβ-keto ester
substrates.

Diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (DEEMM) was purchased from
Tokyo chemical industry Co., Ltd. Ethyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-
triﬂuorophenyl) butanoate were obtained from CKD BiO Corp,
Korea. The genes encoding various TAs (except TAPO and TAST),
FDH, FDHm and AlaDH were synthesized by Bionics (Seoul,
Korea).
2.2 The expression and puriﬁcation of
enzymes
The genes that code for the diverse TAs were made by Bionics
company (Seoul, Korea). The IPTG-inducible pET24ma vectors
carrying each gene were then transformed into E. coli (BL21)
cells and allowed to grow in 0.5 L of LB with kanamycin (50 mg/
mL) at 37
°C. When the OD600 reached 0.6– 0.8, 0.1 mM IPTG was
added to induce the cells following the overnight induction at 20°C.
Next, centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min was used to harvest the
E. coli(BL21) cells, which were washed twice in 200 mM Tris/HCl
buffer (pH 7.0). A horn-type sonicator (Sonics& Material Inc.,
United States) was used to provide ultrasonic disruption to the
washed cells after resuspending them in a 10 mL lysis buffer. To
purify the C-terminally His
6-tagged enzymes from the cell lysates,
Ni-NTA agarose resin [Qiagen, Hilden, Germany] was used. The
rising gradient of imidazole [50– 250 mM] was used to elute the
enzymes. An Amicon PM-10 ultraﬁltration device was used to
dialyze the eluted solution (protein) against a 20 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.4) to concentrate the protein puriﬁed.
2.3 Synthesis of hybrid nanoﬂower
The puriﬁed enzymes (TAs) (0.2 mg/mL) were dissolved in
10 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4), uniformly dispersed

with 2 mM different salt solutions (Copper sulphate (CuSO 4),
potassium sulphate (K 2SO4), sodium sulphate (Na 2SO4),
magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4), zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4), nickel
sulphate (NiSO4), ferrous sulphate (FeSO4) and cobalt sulphate
(CoSO4) and then incubated undisturbed at 4 °C for 72 h.
Organic−inorganic hybrid nanoﬂowers were obtained as a white
precipitate at the bottom of the reaction vessel (Eppendorf).
Synthesized nano ﬂowers were collected after centrifugation at
10000 g for 5 min and washed successively 2 – 3 times with
50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.0) to remove unbound protein and
stored at 4
°C for further use (Rai et al., 2018). Protein loading in the
hybrid nanoﬂowers was determined using the Bradford assay. The
synthesized hybrid nanoﬂowers were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM).
2.4 Isolation of (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid
from reaction mixture
A biocatalytic reaction was performed, in a total volume of
100 mL and after completion of the reaction with complete
conversion, the reaction mixture was subjected to isolation and

puriﬁcation of the desired product. The reaction solution including
the desired products was ﬁrst centrifuged for 20 min, then the
precipitate (HNF) was removed through ﬁltration. Next, the
supernatant layer pH was adjusted to pH 11 using 5 M NaOH,
followed by extracted twice with ethyl acetate to get rid of the
unreacted amine donor and other reaction intermediates that
removed using organic solvents. After the separated aqueous
layer was evaporated to reduce the volume, tert-butanol, sodium
hydroxide (1.1 eq), and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc-anhydride
3.0 eq) were added in equal parts to begin the Boc-protection
process. After being agitated at room temperature for 12 h, the
reaction mixture was made more acidic (pH 5.0) by adding 6 M HCl.
The resultant solution underwent two ethyl acetate extractions, a
brine wash, a drying step over magnesium sulfate, and vacuum
concentration. An equivalent volume of methanol and 4N HCl were
then used to execute a Boc deprotection reaction for 1 h, and the
resultant solution was then concentrated in a vacuum to produce the
desired product with an isolated yield of 62%.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Screening of transaminase for the
amination of levulinic acid
The activity of TAs towards various substrates differs
signiﬁcantly, as it is largely controlled by steric constraints in
the substrate-binding pockets of the enzyme (Jeon et al., 2022).
For the TA-catalyzed reactions utilization of IPA as an amino
donor is more favorable due to its cost effectiveness and easily
removable coproduct acetone (Simon et al., 2014; Dawood et al.,
2018). Moreover, to utilize IPA as an amino donor we screened
the various TAs for the conversion of LA to its corresponding
amine compound. However, there should not be any considerable
conversion of LA using IPA as an amino donor (Supplementary
Figure S1). Therefore, we further investigate TAs reactions using
(S)-α-MBA as an amino donor for the synthesis of corresponding
amine employing LA as a substrate. Generally, in TA-catalyzed
reaction using (S)-α-MBA as an amino donor showed signiﬁcant
activity. A panel of 30 in-house TAs (Supplementary Table S1)
was evaluated toﬁnd the best ones for accelerating the conversion
of LA to the corresponding amine employing IPA and ( S)-α-
MBA as an amino donor. Following codon optimization, the
genes encoding TAs from 30 distinct sources were synthesized,
cloned in pET-24ma, and expressed inE. coliBL21 (DE3). For the
initial screening, 200μL reaction mixture containing LB medium,
an antibiotic (kanamycin 50 mg/mL), IPTG, and whole-cells
expressing individual enzymes was set up in a 96-well
microtiter plate and incubated overnight at 37
°Ci na no r b i t a l
shaker. The cells were harvested, and the LA amination reaction
was carried out using them in a solution containing 10 mM LA as
a substrate, 25 mM (S)-α-MBA or 100 mM IPA, 0.1 mM PLP, and
100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 37
°Cf o r2 4 h(Figure 2A,
Supplementary Figure S2 ). The reaction was stopped with the

addition of 10% PCA solution, and HPLC was used for analysis.
While employing (S)-α-MBA as an amino donor, the majority of
TAs were still able to successfully aminate the LA substrate, albeit
at decreased conversion rates. The highest conversion rates were
demonstrated by TAKI and TAAF (28%), followed by TAPI,
TARO, and TABV with conversions ranging from 24% to 26%.
Therefore, 5 TAs (TAKI, TAAF, TAPI, TARO, and TABV) were
chosen for further investigation.
It is worth noting that transamination reactions catalyzed by
TAs generally are thermodynamically limited (Voges et al., 2016).
For instance, the generation of deaminated ( S)-α-MBA,
i.e., acetophenone after the amination of LA in the present
study limits the progress of the forward reaction. The recycling
or removal of the deaminated co-product can overcome the
thermodynamic barrier of the reaction. We hypothesized that
recycling acetophenone to ( S)-α-MBA using IPA as an amino
donor by another TA can circumvent this problem. Thus, the
transamination ef ﬁciency of TAs was evaluated using
acetophenone as a substrate while using IPA as an amino
donor. We commenced our investigation to identify the optimal

biotransformation using 50 mM acetophenone as the substrate,
IPA at varying doses (corresponding to 10, 15, and 20 equivalent),
for 24 h, was performed (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S3).
Among the 30 investigated TAs, TASP demonstrated the highest
conversion (30%) using 20 equivalent IPA as an amino donor.
While two other TAs, viz. TAML and TAAT showed mediocre
conversions of 6% and 4%, respectively, all the remaining TAs
exhibited negligible conversions. The successful utilization of IPA
by TASP corroborated theﬁndings of the Kroutil and Bornscheuer
group, who reported that a wide number of enzymes from the fold-
type I group of amine transam inases (ATAs) use IPA while
typically exhibiting ( S)-selectivity (Simon et al., 2014; Dawood
et al., 2018).
3.2 Coupled reaction employing two
transaminases (TA1/TA2)
Asymmetric synthesis is one of the most practical and economically
advantageous methods for producing an enantiopure target molecules
since it can produce a theoretical yield of 100%. However, unfavorable
reaction equilibrium is a crucial downside of this approach. Thus,
equilibrium displacement approa c h e ss u c ha st h eu s eo fe x c e s s i v e
amounts of amine donor and/or rapid removal of co-products using
enzymatic cascades have been developed (Green et al., 2014; Richter
et al., 2015; Khobragade et al., 2021). Since preliminary experiments
revealed the potential of TASP to recycle acetophenone, we attempted
to establish a coupled enzyme reaction constituting both the
transaminases in a single pot. The whole-cell biotransformation
reaction was performed usingﬁve enzymes (TAKI, TAAF, TAPI,
TARO and TABV) and coupled with TA2 (TASP) containing
10 mM LA as a substrate, 25 mM ( S)-α-MBA, 100 mM IPA,
0.1 mM PLP, 6 mg
CDW/mL of cell TA1 and 6 mgCDW/mL of cell
TA2, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 37 °Cf o r2 4 h
(Supplementary Table S2). The highest conversion was observed by
the combination of TASP with TAKI (58%), followed by TAAF (42%)
and TABV (40%), and TARO (39%). In addition, the recycling of
deaminated (S)-α-MBA and L-alanine generated by TA
1 was also
attempted using the TA recycling system and Alanine
dehydrogenase (AlaDH) recycling system (Supplementary Figure
S4). TA1/TASP was replaced by the TA
1/AlaDH recycling system
while using L-alanine as an amino donor. The recycling system
employing two transaminases (TAKI/TASP) achieved the maximum
conversion of 59%, whereas TAPI/TASP demonstrated the lowest
conversion of 30%. On the other hand, the TA
1/AlaDH system
could achieve a mediocre conversion of 5%. Furthermore, no
conversion was achieved with the use of IPA as an amino donor for
TA
1 enzymes (Supplementary Figure S5). These results demonstrated
the suitability of the coupled-transaminase system (TA1/TA2)f o rt h e
co-product removal and recycling of the amino donor.

Khobragade et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1280464
The speciﬁc activities of previously reported TA (TABKV)
(Jiang et al., 2014 ) and the best enzyme in the preliminary
experiments (TAKI) (System A1) were determined to be 103 and
128 mU/mg, respectively. To compare the catalytic efﬁciency of the
newly screened TAKI with the previously reported TABKV, the
apparent kinetic parameters toward LA and the co-substrate (S)-α-
MBA were investigated. ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Marginally
lower KM value (5.9 mM) in the case of TAKI led to a 3-fold
increase in the catalytic efﬁciency compared to that by TABKV
(Supplementary Table S3, entry 1). Moreover, an enzymatic reaction
was performed where TABKV afforded 20% conversion of LA as a
substrate and, the maximum conversion achieved by TAKI was 32%
under identical reaction conditions ( Supplementary Figure S6).
Therefore, TAKI was used for further experiments.
The concentration of the amino donor in a biocatalytic
transamination plays a pivotal role in driving the reaction
equilibrium and ultimately in the product formation. A whole-
cell reaction was carried out with varying concentrations of amino
donor (S)-α-MBA ranging from 5 to 35 mM and 10 mM LA as a
substrate with TAKI ( Supplementary Figure S7 ). The highest
conversion (30%) was displayed when 25 mM (S)-α-MBA was
used, on the other hand only 4% conversion was afforded with
the use of 5 mM (S)-α-MBA. An increase in the concentration of (S)-
α-MBA beyond 25 mM exhibited a negative effect on the ﬁnal
product formation. Furthermore, a coupled transaminase reaction
(TAKI/TASP) (System A2,Figure 3A) was performed with varying
concentrations of amino donor (5– 35 mM (S)-α-MBA), 10 mM LA,
100 mM IPA, 0.1 mM PLP, 6 mg
CDW/mL of cell TA1 (TAKI) or
6m gCDW/mL of cell TA2 (TASP), 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0),
37°C for 24 h (Figure 3B). A linear increase in product formation was
observed with the increasing concentration of ( S)-α-MBA till
25 mM. The highest conversion of 60% was achieved with the
use of 25 mM (S)-α-MBA. Further increase in the concentration
of (S)-α-MBA beyond 25 mM showed a detrimental effect on the
formation of (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid product from LA substrate.
Therefore, 25 mM (S)-α-MBA was the most suitable for the reaction
and was used in subsequent experiments.
Similarly, the effect of IPA concentration on the reaction was
investigated by varying the concentration of IPA from 50 to 200 mM
(Figure 3C). The highest conversion was achieved when 100 mM of

IPA was used, whereas the lowest was for 50 mM IPA. The excess of
IPA concentration of more than 10 equivalent led to lowered
product formation. Hence, the IPA concentration was ﬁxed at
100 mM for the following experiments.
3.3 Construction of single cell system by co-
expression and creation of dual-function
fusion protein
T h eu l t i m a t eo u t c o m e so ft h eb i o c a talytic cascade comprising more
than a single whole-cell catalyst are often challenged by the mass
transfer limitations (Patil et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2020). However, a
single wholecell catalyst expressing multiple enzymes is easy to handle
and less laborious, therefore reduced the overall cost of the enzymatic
process and more importantly circumvent the mass-transfer limitations
(Ahn et al., 2023). In order to address these issues, we developed a
single-cell system co-expressingboth the transaminases (System A3).
Both TAs were initially cloned in pET-24ma vector. In order to generate
a single-cell system, one of the TAs needed to be cloned in a different
vector. Thus, TA
2 was successfully cloned in the pCDF duet vector
(Figure 4A). Having the single-cell expression system in hand, we
further evaluated the effect of varying amounts of whole-cell catalyst on
the formation of the desired product. A reaction was carried out using
varying amounts of biocatalyst (3– 24 mg
CDW/mL), 10 mM substrate,
0 . 1m MP L P ,2 5m M(S)-α-MBA, 100 mM IPA, and 100 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) at 37°Cf o r2 4h ,w h e r e i n1 2m gCDW/mL of single-cell
catalyst afforded the highest conversion of 62% (Figure 4A). On the
other hand, the least conversion (21%) was observed with the use of
3m g
CDW/mL whole-cell catalyst.
In order to further improve the conversion of the LA substrate to
the desired ( S)-4-aminopentanoic acid, a fusion protein was
constructed. Fusion proteins belong to a group of proteins that
contain two or more distinct proteins combined into a single
molecule, which normally demonstrate the enhanced enzyme
expression, stability and catalytical activity. The selected both the
TAs are dimeric enzymes. The original plasmid (pET24ma)
encoding the TASP (TA
2) on N-terminal and TAKI (TA1)o n
C-terminal served as the basis for recombinant proteins’ genetic
assembly, and aﬂexible linker (GGGGS)2 was added to 2 TAs to aid
in folding. It has been demonstrated that polar amino acids smaller
in size, for example, glycine and serine offer the bestﬂexibility and
stability in water (Chen et al., 2013; Aalbers and Fraaje, 2019). After
successful construction of a dual-function fusion protein (System
A4) (Supplementary Figure S8), the effect of loading amount of
whole-cell catalyst was evaluated by varying the amount of
biocatalyst ranging from 3 to 24 mg
CDW/mL in a reaction
mixture containing 10 mM LA substrate, 0.1 mM PLP, 25 mM
(S)-α-MBA, 100 mM IPA, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0),
37
°C for 24 h (Figure 4B). The increase in the amount of whole-
cells containing a fusion construct from 3 to 12 mg CDW/mL
continuously increased the product formation and maximum
conversion of 78% was achieved with the use of 12 mg
CDW/mL
whole-cells containing a fusion construct. This was a substantial
increment of 20% compared to that achieved by the co-expressed
single cell-system (System A3). Additionally, a time-point analysis
was carried out using the 12 mg
CDW/mL cells, which demonstrated
the maximum conversion at 24 h (Supplementary Figure S9).
Furthermore, we investigated the impact of pH on the enzymatic
process (Supplementary Figure S10). The experiments used 10 mM
LA as the substrate and varied the pH between 7.0 and 10.0. While
pH 7.0 showed the least conversion, pH 8.0 achieved the highest
conversion of about 80%. On the other hand, product formation
decreased as the pH rose to over 8.0. Thus, pH 8.0 was used for the
next investigations. Furthermore, reactions with higher substrate
concentrations (20 and 50 mM) were carried out, wherein mediocre
conversions of only −15 and 0.5% were afforded (Supplementary
Figure S11 ). These poor conversion rates could plausibly be
attributed to the product and/or substrate inhibition. Thus,
further efforts were dedicated to study the substrate and product
inhibition.
To investigate the inhibition of fusion protein by LA substrate, a
reaction was carried out for 30 min in 100 mM Tris−HCl buffer
(pH 8.0) containing puriﬁed fusion protein (0.5 mg/mL), 25 mM
(S)-α-MBA, 0.1 mM PLP and increasing concentration of substrate
from 5 to 50 mM ( Supplementary Figure S12A ). Signi ﬁcant
substrate inhibition was observed when the concentration of LA
substrate exceeded 10 mM. Similar to this, a reaction was run for
30 min in a 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing puriﬁed
fusion protein (0.5 mg/mL), 25 mM (S)-α-MBA, 0.1 mM PLP and in
the presence of 5– 50 mM (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid to evaluate the
product inhibition of fusion protein by (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid
(Supplementary Figure S12B). The results revealed that the puriﬁed
fusion protein was substantially inhibited by (S)-4-aminopentanoic
acid beyond the concentration of 10 mM.
3.4 Synthesis of dual function nanoﬂowers
and their application for the enzymatic
transamination reaction
Hybrid nano ﬂowers (HNFs) are mixtures of organic and
inorganic components with a three-dimensional hierarchical
nanostructure resembling a ﬂower (Li et al., 2020 ; Lv et al.,
2020). Ge unintentionally mixed copper sulphate (CuSO
4) into
phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin,
leading to the discovery of theﬁrst HNF (Ge et al., 2012). HNFs
have now garnered a lot of interest because of their ability to
integrate the functions of organic and inorganic materials, as well
as their quick and environmentally friendly preparation. In the
present study, the self-assembly approach was used in the
production of HNF, wherein the organic component was a fusion
protein and the inorganic component was a metal salt. First, the
efﬁciency of several salts including CuSO
4, potassium sulphate
(K2SO4), sodium sulphate (Na 2SO4), magnesium sulphate
(MgSO4), zinc sulphate (ZnSO4), nickel sulphate (NiSO4), ferrous
sulphate (FeSO4) and cobalt sulphate (CoSO4) was investigated for
the synthesis of HNFs. Nanoﬂowers were synthesized using CuSO4
salt displayed the maximum protein loading of about 99%, followed
by 96% and 92% by ZnSO4 and NiSO4 salts, respectively. Whereas a
moderate protein loading was observed for the FeSO4 and CoSO4.
On the other hand, the K2SO4,N a2SO4, and MgSO4 salts, barely
contained any protein loading. Subsequently, the effect of various
metal ions on the enzyme activity was investigated. The relative
activity was expressed as a percentage of the activity displayed by the
fusion protein without immobilization (As a control experiment).
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org09
Khobragade et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1280464
While, the HNFs obtained using K2SO4,N a2SO4, and MgSO4 salts
did not exhibit any activity, those obtained with CuSO4, ZnSO4, and
NiSO4 salts maintained the relative activity around 80%– 85%. In the
case of FeSO4 and CoSO4 salts the relative activity of HNF exhibits
35%– 38% (Figure 5A). Taking into account theseﬁndings, HNFs
obtained with CuSO4, ZnSO4, and NiSO4 salts were selected for
further research. The synthesized HNF has a rhombic shape having
a dimension or size approx. 600 nm (Figure 5B). TheGe et al., 2012
reported the similar shape of HNF. However, we characterized the
synthesized nanoﬂower using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Next, the HNFs obtained using CuSO
4, ZnSO4, and NiSO4 salts
were evaluated for the enzymatic conversion of the LA substrate. All
the tested HNFs exhibited good conversions ranging from 82% to
100% (Supplementary Figure S13). While the HNF obtained using
ZnSO
4 and NiSO4 salts afforded conversions of 86% and 82%
respectively, the complete conversion ( >99%) was achieved by
the HNF obtained using CuSO 4 (Figure 5C). The conversion
achieved by the CuSO4-HNF was 22% higher than that obtained
by the fusion protein system (System A4). These positive results
encouraged us to carry out the reactions with higher substrate
concentrations (20 and 50 mM) ( Supplementary Figure S14 ).
Compared to the prior experiment, the product formation for the
20, 50 mM substrate reaction with HNF of CuSO
4 increased by
around 2.3 and 5-fold respectively. Employing HNF of ZnSO4 and
NiSO4 salts also resulted in a modest conversion improvement.
Additionally, the investigation of the enzymatic conversion of
10 mM LA substrate by employing puriﬁed protein TAKI and
TASP (System A5) and puri ﬁed fusion protein (System A6)
resulted in the conversion of 82% and 85% respectively
(Supplementary Figure S15 ). Owing to the better conversion
afforded, HNF of CuSO
4 salt (System A7) was used for further
investigation.
In order to circumvent the limitations associated with product/
substrate inhibition, we employed a fed-batch approach (Figure 5D).
The enzymatic reaction employing A7 system wasﬁrst carried out
using 10 mM LA as a substrate. After the substrate had completely
turned into a product in 24 h, 10 mM substrate was added again into
the reaction which resulted in 8 mM product formation.
Unfortunately, a further addition of 10 mM substrate resulted in
conversion of only 3 mM. The overall conversion of about 70% was
achieved by employing the fed-batch approach. As anticipated, the
substrate and product inhibition experienced by the immobilized
biocatalyst was slightly lessened compared to that by the free enzyme
(Supplementary Figure S16).
The operational stability is an important consideration in the
economics of biotransformation ’s involving immobilized
biocatalysts. The repeated use of immobilized biocatalysts is one
of the biggest advantages over the free enzyme. The hybrid
nanoﬂowers synthesized using CuSO
4 in the present study
(System A7) could be utilized for seven consecutive cycles
without any loss in activity ( Figure 6A). The leaching of the
enzyme from the hybrid nanoﬂowers and thermal deactivation
during each batch reaction of 24 h can be attributed to the
decreased conversion efﬁciency of hybrid nanoﬂowers after seven
cycles. Evaluation of storage stability at different temperatures
revealed that system A7 was stable for more than a month at 4
°C
and room temperature (Figure 6B). In contrast, the free enzyme lost
more than 70% of its activity after 20 days when stored at different
temperatures.
3.5 A preparative scale reaction, isolation of
product and applicability of the dual-
function hybrid nanoﬂowers for the
synthesis of variousβ-amino acids
The synthetic applicability of the immobilized enzyme system
(System A7) was investigated on a preparative scale (100 mg). The
reaction mixture consisted of 10 mM LA substrate, 0.1 mM PLP,
25 mM (S)-α-MBA, 100 mM IPA, 0.5 mg/mL of System A7,
100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 37
°C for 24 h in a total
volume of 100 mL. The time-point analysis of samples showed
almost complete consumption of substrate within 24 h, thereby
achieving >99% conversion to the ﬁnal product ( S)-4-
aminopentanoic acid (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figures S17, 18).
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was subjected
to isolation and puriﬁcation of the desired product (See material and
method section). The isolated yield of desired product was 62% and
characterized by using
1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC
(Supplementary Figures S19, 20). As we design and develop the
different biocatalytic system for the production of ( S)-4-
aminopentanoic acid using biobased LA as a substrate the
corresponding results summarized inFigure 7B.
β-amino acids are important structural moieties present in
numerous natural and synthetic bioactive compounds (Jeon et al.,
2018; Kim et al., 2019). The efﬁcient synthesis of enantiopure (S)-4-
aminopentoic acid by the biocatalytic system employing HNF
encouraged us to check its applicability as a synthetic route for
β-amino acids via asymmetric synthesis. Sixβ-keto ester substrates
were tested for the synthesis of corresponding β-amino acids
(Supplementary Figure S21 and Supplementary Table S4 ).
Among the tested substrates, ethyl 3-(4- ﬂuorophenyl)-3-
oxopropanoate (1a) gave the highest conversion (48%). On the
contrary, ethyl 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxopropanoate (1f) showed
the least conversion (18%). The conversion of all the other β-
keto ester substrates to their correspondingβ-amino acids ranged
from 30% to 40%. The conversion of aromaticβ-amino acids was
moderate with dual function HNF. However, TA
1 was screened for
LA as a substrate for the synthesis of (S)-4-aminopentoic acid not for
the synthesis of aromatic β-amino acids. Therefore, it was not
surprising to get less or poor conversion. Moreover, the dual
function enzymes based HNF can enhance product formation
compared to other developed systems. Furthermore, 1a was
selected for the subsequent experiments (Supplementary Figure
S22). Different cell systems previously developed for the synthesis
of (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid were employed for the conversion of
1a to the correspondingβ-amino acid (Supplementary Table S5).
The whole cell biotransformation ’s reaction was performed
including a separately expressed 1 cells TA
1 (System A1),
separately expressed 2 cells TA1 and TA2 (System A2), 1 cells co-
expressed 2 TAs (System A3) and 1 cells fusion proteins (system A4)
and puriﬁed fusion protein system (System A5) were employed
(Supplementary Table S5). While the separately expressed 1 cells
TA1 (System A1) afforded only 8% conversion, the maximum
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org10

conversion of 32%was achieved by the puri ﬁed fusion protein
system (System A5).
One of the well-known examples of medications withβ-amino
acids as essential ingredients is sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 that is used as an oral diabetic medication (Savile et al.,
2010; Kim et al., 2019; Khobragade et al., 2021; Kaur and Jana, 2023).
In our previous research, the sitagliptin intermediate was produced
employing TA fromIlumatobacter coccineus(TAIC, TA
3)f r o mt h e
ethyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-triﬂuorophenyl) butanoate as a substrate
(Khobragade et al., 2023). Therefore, to test the applicability of
developed system for the synthesis of sitagliptin intermediate here
we employed TA
3 (TAIC) instead of TA1 (TAKI) in a coupled
transamination reaction (Figure 8A). A higher substrate enzymatic
reaction (200 mM) was carried out, wherein a maximum conversion
of 84% was achieved in 72 h (Figure 8B). Furthermore, we investigated
a higher substrate concentration by employing a puriﬁed fusion
protein system (System A6), which resulted in 67% of theﬁnal
product. These ﬁndings indicated that the HNF system developed
herein was a more efﬁcient approach for the biosynthesis of variousβ-
amino acids including sitagliptin intermediate.
4 Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed various biocatalytic
systems to efﬁciently synthesize (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid from LA
substrate. A recyclable cascade employing 2 TAs (TAKI and TASP)
was developed for the co-product removal and recycling of the amino
donor. Separately expressed one whole cells (TA
1), separately
expressed two whole cells (TA1 and TA2), one whole cells co-
expressed system, and one whole cells fusion proteins were among
the several whole cell systems established, wherein the puriﬁed fusion
protein comprising of TAKI and TASP afforded 85% conversion of
LA to (S)-4-aminopentanoic acid. The HNFs synthesized using this
fusion protein construct improved the conversion by 3.3-fold
compared to separately expressed 1 cells (TAKI) and retained the
activity for 7 consecutive cycles while maintaining storage stability for
more than a month. Preparative scale reaction (100 mL) using the
HNFs achieved complete conversion with an isolated yield of 62%.
Furthermore, the established biocatalytic system afforded the
transformation of differentβ-keto ester substrates to corresponding
β-amino acids with conversions ranging from 18% to 48%. Finally, the
applicability of this established biocatalytic cascade was further
extended for the enzymatic synthesis of sitagliptin intermediate
with an excellent conversion of 82%. One of the features of this
system is any TAs can utilize IPA as an amino donor through fused
TA by a combination of another amino donor like (S)-α-MBA,
L-alanine. The use of the catalytic amount of amino donors for
recycling is crucial. Therefore, we devoted an effort to developing
the system for the catalytic amount of amino donors under progress in
our lab. In conclusion, we established the dual-function enzyme based
one-pot cascade employing hybrid nano ﬂowers of fused two
transaminase, which paves the way for expanding a toolbox for
transaminases having difﬁculty to accept the isopropyl amine as an
amino donor for the synthesis of various value-added amine
compounds and would enjoy the extended applicability.
