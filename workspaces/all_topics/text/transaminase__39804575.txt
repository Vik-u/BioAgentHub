Abstract
Background and Objectives
Safety and eﬃcacy of IV onasemnogene abeparvovec has been demonstrated for patients with
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) weighing <8.5 kg. SMART was theﬁrst clinical trial to evaluate
onasemnogene abeparvovec for participants weighing 8.5– 21 kg.
Methods
SMART was an open-label, multicenter, phase 3b study conducted across 13 sites in 9 countries
(NCT04851873). Symptomatic pediatric participants with SMA (any type; treatment-na¨ıve or
had discontinued prior treatment) were stratiﬁed into 3 weight cohorts (≥8.5– 13, >13– 17,
and >17– 21 kg), administered onasemnogene abeparvovec, and followed for 52 weeks. Corti-
costeroids were initiated 24 hours before infusion with dose increases in response to adverse
events (AEs) and subsequent tapering at investigator discretion. The primary objective was safety.
Secondary objective was eﬃcacy (motor function/motor milestones).
Results
Twenty-four participants were enrolled; the majority had SMA type 2 (n = 11), 3SMN2 copies
(n = 18), and prior treatment (n = 21). All participants completed the study; no deaths
occurred. All participants had≥1 treatment-related AE(s), 7 of 24 (29%) had serious treatment-
related AEs, and 23 of 24 (96%) had≥1 AE of special interest. Twenty of 24 participants (83%)
had asymptomatic hepatotoxicity events, which were primarily transaminase elevations. No
participant had bilirubin elevations >2× upper limit of normal, developed symptomatic hep-
atotoxicity, or met Hy law criteria. Transient asymptomatic thrombocytopenia events were
reported in 17 of 24 participants (71%); all resolved spontaneously with no related bleeding
events reported. Three of 24 participants (13%) had cardiac AEs (all unrelated to treatment).
No thrombotic microangiopathy or dorsal root ganglionopathy-related AEs were reported. AE
frequency and severity were similar across weight groups, although corticosteroid exposure was
greater for the 2 heavier cohorts (median 135.0, 201.0, and 194.0 days, respectively) with 37%
and 33% still on corticosteroids at the study end. By week 52, most participants maintained or

participants (all 3SMN2 copies) achieved new motor milestones.
Discussion
Onasemnogene abeparvovec safety proﬁle was similar across weight groups in this heterogenous participant population.
Frequency and duration of asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations and thrombocytopenia are notableﬁndings. Most
participants demonstrated maintenance or improvement of motor function, suggesting clinical beneﬁt for patients with SMA
weighing up to 21 kg.
Trial Registration Information
ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer (NCT04851873, clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04851873) submitted April 19, 2021. First partici-
pant enrolled on September 8, 2021.
Classification of Evidence
This study provides Class IV evidence that intravenous onasemnogene abeparvovec is safe in pediatric patients with SMA who
weigh 8.5– 21 kg.
Introduction
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive, neuro-
muscular disease caused by the biallelic deletion or variation of
the essential survival motor neuron 1(SMN1) gene. Loss of
SMN1 gene function leads to deﬁciency of survival motor
neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for motor neuron
survival. SMA treatments include thesurvival motor neuron 2
(SMN2) splicing modiﬁers nusinersen and risdiplam, as well as
onasemnogene abeparvovec, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)
gene therapy.
IV onasemnogene abeparvovec has demonstrated eﬃcacy and
safety across 5 clinical trials of participants with SMA type 11-4
or presymptomatic SMA with 25 or 36 SMN2 gene copies.
Compared with natural history, patients with symptomatic
SMA treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec demonstrated
substantial improvements in event-free survival and motor
function, achievement of developmental motor milestones,
and independence from respiratory and nutritional support.
1-6
Long-term safety and sustained eﬃcacy has been demon-
strated for more than 5 years post dosing.7
Previous completed trials investigating the eﬃcacy and safety
of IV onasemnogene abeparvovec enrolled only treatment-
na¨ıve participants weighing less than 8.5 kg at the time of
treatment.1-6 Additional clinical trial data were required to
conﬁrm safety and eﬃcacy for participants up to 21 kg. The
SMART study (NCT04851873) was a phase 3b, open-label,
single-arm, multinational study undertaken to determine the
safety, tolerability, and eﬃcacy of IV onasemnogene abe-
parvovec for participants with SMA (anySMN2 copy num-
ber) weighing 8.5– 21 kg, some of whom had discontinued
another approved disease-modifying treatment. These data
will help support informed treatment decision-making by
health care professionals and caregivers and complement
published real-world evidence.

Methods
Study Design
SMART was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 3b
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and eﬃcacy of IV ona-
semnogene abeparvovec for participants with SMA weighing
8.5– 21 kg (eFigure 1). The SMART study aimed to enroll 24– 30
participants evenly across 3 weight groups (weight determined at
dosing):≥8.5– 13, >13– 17, and >17– 21 kg.
Participants who met eligibility criteria at screening and
baseline visits received a single dose of IV onasemnogene
abeparvovec (1.1 × 10
14 vector genomes [vg]/kg) on day 1
(treatment period), followed by inpatient safety monitoring
for 48 hours and a 12-month follow-up period. After study
completion, participants were invited to enroll in a long-term
follow-up study, SPECTRUM (NCT05335876).

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations,
and Participant Consents
This clinical study was undertaken in accordance with the In-
ternational Council for Harmonisation E6 Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice with the ethical principles laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by in-
stitutional review boards at all participating institutions (Ethics
Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven [S65529]; Institutional
Review Board-II Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho
Memorial Hospital [KMUHIRB-F(II)-20210115]; McGill
University Health Centre Research Ethics Board [#2022-
7908]; North East– York Research Ethics Committee; Sydney
Children’s Hospital Network Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee [SCHN HREC 2021_ETH00694]). Written informed
consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of en-
rolled participants. The SMART study was registered at Clin-
icalTrials.gov (NCT04851873).
Participants
Full eligibility criteria are listed in the eMethods. Key inclusion
criteria included a symptomatic SMA diagnosis conﬁrmed by
biallelic SMN1 pathogenic variants (deletion or point variants)
and any number ofSMN2 gene copies, weight≥8.5– ≤21 kg at
the time of screening, and na¨ıve to treatment or have dis-
continued an approved disease-modifying therapy according to
the washout period recommended per treatment (>4 months
for nusinersen and >15 days for risdiplam).
Key exclusion criteria included elevated anti-AAV9 antibody
titer greater than 1:50; inability to take corticosteroids; re-
quiring invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, or awake non-
invasive ventilation; hepatic dysfunction (as deﬁned in the
eMethods); presence of a conﬁrmed or suspected active in-
fectious process; and if previously treated with disease-
modifying treatment, participants were excluded if they
received less than 3 doses of nusinersen, nusinersen within
4 months before screening, or risdiplam within 15 days before
screening.
The ﬁrst participant was enrolled on September 8, 2021, and
treated on October 8, 2021. The last participant enrolled was
treated on July 5, 2022.
Treatment
Participants received prophylactic prednisolone (or equiva-
lent) 1 mg/kg/d approximately 24 hours before the infusion
to mitigate the safety risks associated with immune response
to the AAV9 capsid, as per onasemnogene abeparvovec ad-
ministration guidelines. On day 1, participants received a sin-
gle IV administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec (1.1 ×
10
14 vg/kg) for approximately 60 minutes followed by in-
patient safety monitoring for 48 hours. Corticosteroids were
continued at 1 mg/kg/d for at least 30-day postinfusion,
followed by weekly tapering by 0.25 mg/kg/d reductions if
serum transaminases had returned to within normal range.
Dose changes and subsequent tapering were allowed as per
investigator discretion.
Primary Objective
The primary objective was safety as measured by the in-
cidence and severity of reported treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse
events of special interest (AESI) (including hepatotoxicity,
thrombocytopenia, cardiac adverse events [AEs], troponin I,
clinical symptoms of dorsal root ganglia toxicity, and throm-
botic microangiopathy). AESI were identi ﬁed using pre-
deﬁned AE search terms that broadly summarize each
umbrella term. Changes from baseline in vital signs, cardiac
safety assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardio-
gram), and clinical laboratory assessments were also mea-
sured. Laboratory parameters included, but were not limited
to, platelets, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase, alkaline
phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin (to-
tal, direct, and indirect). Safety was monitored on an ongoing
basis by an external Data Monitoring Committee.
Secondary Objective
The secondary objective was to determine the eﬃcacy of IV
onasemnogene abeparvovec as measured by change from base-
line in achieved developmental motor milestones according to
the World Health OrganizationMulticentre Growth Reference
Study and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development,
Third Edition (Bayley-III) criteria, Hammersmith Functional
Motor Scale– Expanded (HFMSE), and Revised Upper Limb
Module (RULM), as appropriate according to participant age.
Change from baseline was reported in all participants who had
data (all items) at baseline and at subsequent visit.
Data Analysis
Analysis sets included the full analysis set and the safety set
both of which comprised all participants who received IV
onasemnogene abeparvovec.
Data analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). To identify safety signals whose
underlying incidence rate was approximately 10% or greater,
the sample size of 24 participants was considered reasonable
(R Statistical Software, Vienna, Austria) to provide descriptive
safety information across 3 weight brackets from ≥8.5
to ≤21 kg, providing 90% probability to observe at least 1
event (any unspeciﬁed safety event) if the underlying in-
cidence of the event was 9%.
Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percent-
ages, and continuous data were presented using summary
statistics. Incidence and severity for TEAEs, SAEs, and AESI
were summarized overall and by weight bracket in the safety
set. Changes from baseline in HFMSE and RULM, as well as
developmental motor milestone achievements, were sum-
marized overall and by weight bracket for the full analysis set.

Results
Participant Disposition
The SMART study was initiated on September 8, 2021, and
the last participant was treated on July 5, 2022. Twenty-nine
participants with SMA were screened, and 5 participants
did not meet eligibility because of the presence of an active
infection during screening (Figure 1). No participant was
excluded because of anti-AAV9 antibody titer >1:50. Twenty-
four participants were enrolled across the 3 weight brackets:
8.5– 13 kg (n = 7), >13– 17 kg (n = 8), and >17– 21 kg (n = 9)
(eTable 1). All participants completed the 52-week study, and
no participant discontinued the study.
Baseline Clinical Characteristics
The mean (SD) age of participants at baseline was 4.7 (1.82
[range 1.5– 9.1]) years, with older participants generally in the
higher weight group (Table 1). The study enrolled an equal
number of male and female participants, and mean baseline
body mass index values were similar across weight groups.
The enrolled population was heterogeneous in SMA type,
SMN2 copy number, use of previous disease-modifying
treatments, baseline HFMSE scores (range 0– 55), and base-
line RULM scores (range 4– 37). Speciﬁcally, 3 participants
were na¨ıve to treatment, and 21 (88%) had received previous
SMA disease-modifying treatment (nusinersen or risdiplam).
Nineteen participants (79%) had received nusinersen for
a median duration of 2.1 (range 0.17– 4.81) years, and 2
participants (8%) had received risdiplam for a median dura-
tion of 0.48 (range 0.11– 0.85) years. The majority of partic-
ipants included in the SMART study had SMA type 2 (n = 11,
46% vs SMA type 1, n = 8; or SMA type 3, n = 5) and 3 copies
of theSMN2 gene (n = 18, 75% vs 2SMN2 copies, n = 5; or 4
or moreSMN2 copies, n = 1).
Primary Safety Analysis
All participants had at least 1 TEAE, and 1 AE was considered
related to onasemnogene abeparvovec by the study investigator
(Table 2 and eTable 2). No deaths and no AEs leading to
discontinuation from the study were reported. The most fre-
quently reported treatment-related AEs in the overall population
(>20% of participants) were vomiting (63%; n = 15/24), pyrexia
(33%; n = 8/24), nausea (33%; n = 8/24), hyper-
transaminasemia (29%; n = 7/24), and platelet count decreased
(25%; n = 6/24).
Fifteen participants had SAEs, and 7 participants had SAEs
considered related to treatment. The most frequent treatment-
related SAEs were thrombocytopenia (13%; n = 3/24) and
vomiting (8%; n = 2/24).
AESI were reported for 23 participants (96%), including
hepatotoxicity (83%; n = 20/24), thrombocytopenia (71%;
n = 17/24), and cardiac AEs (13%; n = 3/24) (Table 2).

Of the hepatotoxicity events, the most frequently reported pre-
ferred terms were hypertransaminasemia and transaminases in-
creased. Most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity,
with severe events reported in 17% (n = 4/24) of participants. All
participants remained asymptomatic (eTable 3).
Increases in transaminases (ALT or AST) as measured by
clinical chemistry laboratory analysis were observed in the
majority of participants, with 88% (n = 21/24) having an
increase in ALT or AST >3× upper limit of normal (ULN),
58% (n = 14/24) having an increase >10× ULN, and 21% (n =
5/24) having an increase >20× ULN at any time during the
study (Figure 2, A and B). As indicated in Figure 2C, ALT
elevations were similar across weight groups. None of the
participants had an increase in total bilirubin to >2× ULN, and
none met the biochemical criteria for Hy law any time during
the study. Hy law is deﬁned by 3 criteria: (1) evidence of
hepatocellular injury deﬁned by serum ALT or AST >3×
ULN; (2) serum total bilirubin >2× ULN without cholestasis;
and (3) the absence of another etiology, such as viral hepatitis.
The time course of ALT and AST elevations varied between
individual participants, with the peak elevations primarily oc-
curring between week 1 and week 10 postdosing. The per-
centage of participants with elevations in ALT >3× ULN
increased from 29% (n = 7/24) at week 1 to 61% (n = 14/23)
at week 6, decreasing to 24% (n = 5/21) at week 26, and 0%
(n = 0/23) with ALT >3× ULN at weeks 39 and 52. At the end
of study, 67% (n = 16/24) of participants had an ALT value
greater than ULN (but less than 3× ULN) and 8% (n = 2/24)
of participants had an AST value greater than ULN.
AESI in the transient thrombocytopenia category were
reported for 17 participants (71%). Most events were mild or

moderate decreases in platelet counts or thrombocytopenia
(n = 7 each), and all participants remained asymptomatic with
no observed related bleeding events (eTable 4). Three par-
ticipants had thrombocytopenia that were reported as SAEs
all of which spontaneously resolved without intervention.
Three participants had reported cardiac AESI, including
bradycardia, nocturnal dyspnea, and electrocardiogram evi-
dence of T wave inversion (n = 1 each) (eTable 5). All were
mild, and none were considered related to treatment.
No events suggestive of possible dorsal root ganglia cell in-
ﬂammation or overt thrombotic microangiopathy were reported.
Prednisolone Exposure
As per the protocol, all participants received prophylactic
prednisolone (or equivalent) starting at day−1. The dose and
duration of prednisolone to mitigate risk of immune response
to the AAV9 capsid was greater than anticipated based on
experience in previous trials.
1-6 The protocol stipulated that
all participants would receive 1 mg/kg/d prednisolone (or
equivalent) beginning the day before onasemnogene abe-
parvovec infusion and then continued for a minimum of 30
days. After 30 days, the protocol stipulated that prednisolone
could be tapered weekly at increments of 0.25 mg/kg/d pro-
vided that serum ALT concentrations were normal. Inves-
tigators were permitted to increase prednisolone above
1 mg/kg/d and to subsequently taper back down to 1 mg/kg/
d, at their discretion in response to the observed AEs. The
mean (SD) total number of weeks of prednisolone adminis-
tration was 31.2 (15.5) weeks for all 3 cohorts (range 80– 444
days), with greater corticosteroid exposure in the 2 heavier
cohorts (median 135.0, 201.0, and 194.0 days, respectively)
(eTable 6). Twenty-one participants (88%) received a daily
dose of prednisolone that was >1 mg/kg at any time (related
to elevations in aminotransferases), and 9 participants (38%)
received a daily dose >2 mg/kg. Four participants (17%)
received at least 1 IV dose of corticosteroid during the study.
Dose changes and the use of IV corticosteroids were in-
vestigator decisions and were not related to the magnitude of
transaminase increases.
All participants continued prednisolone until at least week 10.
Seventeen participants (71%) at week 26, and 6 participants
(25%) at week 52 were still receiving prednisolone (with 1
participant still receiving prednisolone at day 440). AEs sug-
gestive of hypercortisolism (i.e., Cushing syndrome and
cushingoid features) were reported in 5 participants, attrib-
utable to corticosteroid use, which had resolved in all cases by
end of study.
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The analysis of HFMSE change from baseline included 20
participants who were≥24 months of age at study start and
who had available HFMSE total score data at baseline and
postbaseline. As presented in Table 1, the wide variability in
baseline HFMSE scores, ranging from 0 to 55 (total HFMSE
score ranges from 0 to 66), reﬂects the heterogeneity of the
enrolled population. The majority of the participants in all 3
weight groups achieved improvements from baseline in their
HFMSE score during the study (Figure 3) with median
(range) increases in HFMSE total score of 4.0 (−5 to 11) at
week 26 and 4.0 (−5 to 11) at week 52 overall. Of the 20
participants with baseline and postbaseline HFMSE data, 18
had an increase in HFMSE score and 2 participants had
a decrease in score. At week 52, 11 of 18 participants (61%)
had a clinically meaningful increase of≥3 points in HFMSE
total score (n = 3, 8.5– 13 kg; n = 3, >13– 17 kg; n = 5, >17– 21
kg),
14,15 8 of 18 participants (44%) had an increase of≥6
points (n = 2, 8.5– 13 kg; n = 3, >13– 17 kg; n = 3, >17– 21 kg),

Analysis of RULM change from baseline was performed for 18
participants who were≥30 months of age at study initiation
and who had available RULM total score data at baseline and
postbaseline. Baseline RULM scores ranged from 4 to 37
(Table 1). As displayed in Figure 4, the majority of partic-
ipants had stable or improved RULM total scores during the
study, with median (range) increases in RULM total score of
2.0 (−1 to 8) points at week 26 and 2.0 (−5 to 10) at week 52
overall. At week 52, 7 of 17 participants (41%) had a clinically
meaningful increase of≥3 points in RULM total score (n = 3,
8.5– 13 kg; n = 4, >17– 21 kg),
16 2 of 17 participants (12%) had
an increase of≥6 points (n = 1, 8.5– 13 kg; n = 1, >17– 21 kg),
and 1 participant (6%) had an increase of≥10 points (n = 1,
8.5– 13 kg). Two participants (12%) had a decrease in RULM
total score of≤3 points at week 52 (n = 2, >17– 21 kg).
Analysis of developmental motor milestones at baseline in-
dicated that all participants demonstrated head control and
sitting with support (Table 3 and eTable 7). In the overall
population, 21 participants (88%) sat without support, 10
(42%) demonstrated hands-and-knees crawling, and 9 (38%)
demonstrated pulls to stand. Seven participants (29%) stood
with assistance and walked with assistance; 6 participants
(25%) stood alone; and 6 (25%) walked alone. The majority
of participants maintained their developmental milestones at
week 52. Three participants lost a previously demonstrated

(baseline age and weight group, 5.1 years and >13– 17 kg;
baseline HFMSE and RULM, 8 and 18) who demonstrated
sitting without support for 30 seconds at baseline, 1 partic-
ipant (baseline age and weight group, 3.1 years and >13– 17

strated sitting with support for 30 seconds, and another
participant (baseline age and weight group, 5.4 years
and >17– 21 kg; baseline HFMSE and RULM, 35 and 21)
who demonstrated walking with assistance, did not dem-
onstrate these milestones at 52 weeks. Four participants
achieved new developmental milestones during the study
(n = 2, 8.5– 13 kg; n = 1, >13– 17 kg; n = 1, >17– 21 kg).
These new milestones included higher milestones, such as
standing with assistance (3 new participants), with 2 also
demonstrating walking with assistance at week 52; 1 par-
ticipant also demonstrated standing alone.
Classification of Evidence
This study provides Class IV evidence that intravenous ona-
semnogene abeparvovec is safe in pediatric patients with SMA
weighing 8.5– 21 kg.
Discussion
Unlike previous onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trials, the
SMART study enrolled a heterogeneous population of partic-
ipants (≥8.5– ≤21 kg) across a broad range of ages and SMA
phenotypes, most of whom were previously treated with another
disease-modifying treatment. Although the occurrence of AESI
(hepatotoxicity and thrombocytopenia) was consistent with
previously reported published clinical studies of patients with
SMA type 1 or presymptomatic patients,
1-6 prolonged amino-
transferase elevations in the SMART study were observed in
the majority of participants, with 67% still having elevated

concentrations at week 52. All cases were asymptomatic and
managed with corticosteroid treatment. Many participants re-
ceived greater dosages and longer duration of corticosteroid
dosing than anticipated, with the median duration of cortico-
steroid being 175 days. The duration of corticosteroid exposure
for participants in the 8.5– 13 kg cohort was similar to that ob-
served in previous studies, while participants in the 2 heaviest
categories required more prolonged use of corticosteroids. As
weaning of prednisolone below 1 mg/kg/d was recommended
after serum ALT had returned to normal values, this may have
contributed to the longer duration of corticosteroid dosing in
some cases. Transient asymptomatic thrombocytopenia events
were reported in 71% of participants, and all resolved with no
related bleeding events or need to intervene (Table 2).
Data compiled from 100 participants with SMA treated with
onasemnogene abeparvovec (mean [range] weight at base-
line, 5.2 [3.0– 8.4] kg) in 5 previous clinical trials demon-
strated that most transaminase elevations began at week 1,
with a second peak at month 1 that coincided with prednis-
olone tapering.
17 In addition, most cases with moderate or
severe elevations (≥5× ULN ALT or AST) resolved within
3– 6 months.17 Although most participants in the SMART
study also had transaminase elevations beginning at week 1,
80% of participants continued to have mild, asymptomatic
transaminase elevations at 6 months post dosing. No Hy law
cases were observed in any of the treated participants.
In the SMART study, transaminase increases were similar
across weight groups. The increased occurrence of
transaminase elevations observed in this study was consistent
with previous real-world analyses of heavier patients, some of
whom were previously treated with another disease-
modifying treatment.
8,13 In an observational cohort study
that examined onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment in 76
patients with SMA, some of whom were older than
24 months, weighed >8.5 kg, or were previously treated with
nusinersen, maximum AST and ALT elevations were associ-
ated with older age and heavier weight.
8 In a separate cohort
analysis of 67 onasemnogene abeparvovec-treated patients
with SMA, increased risk for elevated serum transaminase was
also observed for older and heavier patients.
18 In a recent
report describing real-world safety and eﬃcacy data for ona-
semnogene abeparvovec in 99 patients with SMA (54 re-
ceiving prior treatment) with weights ranging from 3.2 to 20.2
(median 7.86) kg, each 5 kg increase in weight was associated
with 2.4-fold higher ALT peak and 46% longer duration of
corticosteroid therapy.
19 Similarly, in a case series, AST and/
or ALT elevations (≥2× ULN) were identiﬁed in 67% of older
(≥8 months of age) patients and 83% of heavier (weight≥8
kg) patients.13 As with the SMART study, no indication of
symptomatic liver dysfunction was observed.13 However, the
contribution of prior treatment on the safetyﬁndings ob-
served in this study is unclear.
In the SMART study, most participants (88%) received
greater prednisolone dosages and for longer periods of time
than anticipated in the protocol guidance and reported for
previous clinical trials.
1-6 For some participants, transaminase
concentrations increased 2 or 3 times, which coincided with

tapering of corticosteroids in some cases, but not all. This is
consistent with real-world evidence describing longer periods
of prednisolone exposure for older and/or heavier patients.8,9
Because most participants required greater dosages of cortico-
steroids compared with what was described in the protocol,
corticosteroid tapering after dose increases in this study was
based on investigator discretion using their clinical assess-
ment, which led to diﬀerent slopes of reduction. In addition,
there was not necessarily a relationship between increased
corticosteroid dosage and resolution of transaminase eleva-
tion. In some cases, investigators discontinued corticosteroid
treatment at their own discretion when slight transaminase
elevations (<2× ULN) were still present, based on individual
beneﬁt-risk evaluations of corticosteroid treatment. ALT
concentrations did not exceed >3× ULN at end of study in any
of those cases. Other studies have also reported that although
most patients heavier than 8 kg with signiﬁcant transaminitis
responded well to doubling of prednisolone, IV methylpred-
nisolone was required in individual cases.
19 These ﬁndings
highlight the importance of evaluating the individual beneﬁt-
risk of prolonged corticosteroid use with expertise from
a multidisciplinary team (e.g., gastroenterology and hepatol-
ogy consultations).
Eﬃcacy results demonstrated that the majority of participants
across all weight cohorts maintained or improved baseline
motor function during the study. This is particularly impor-
tant given the overall heterogeneity of the participant pop-
ulation that included chronic participants who had already
been exposed to another SMN-enhancing drug. Thus, while
most participants had stable or improved motor function at
week 52, a few participants had changes in individual scales,
which is not completely unexpected given this older, more
chronic patient population in whom contractures and other
orthopedic complications might aﬀect motor function. Spe-
ciﬁcally, most participants had improved or maintained
changes from baseline in HFMSE and RULM at week 52,
which is consistent with other real-world studies.
8,18 The
majority of participants also maintained their developmental
milestones during the study, with 4 participants demonstrat-
ing new developmental milestones at week 52. Of note, 6
participants had already achieved the highest milestone
assessed in the study (walking alone) at baseline. Although
some participants had decreases in individual scores and 3 lost
a milestone, these were not universally observed across all
eﬃcacy endpoints. For example, some participants exhibited
a decline of >10 points in HFMSE without a similar decrease
in RULM or developmental motor milestones. Similarly, 3
participants demonstrated a developmental motor milestone
at week 52 that was lower than the one demonstrated at
baseline (sitting without support for 10 seconds vs 30 seconds
for 1 participant, head control vs sitting with support for
another participant, and standing with assistance vs walking
with assistance for another participant); however, these
changes did not coincide with changes in HFMSE or RULM
total scores. These ﬁndings demonstrate the sometimes-
nonlinear motor milestone achievement that may be observed
for some patients with SMA. Furthermore, contributing fac-
tor(s) (e.g., change in evaluator, fracture, or other AE) may
contribute to variability in scores in some cases but could not
be identiﬁed for all participants. For the participant who
sustained an upper limb fracture, this occurred after a fall from
a stationary bicycle (the ability to pedal a bicycle was a new
activity for this child). This participant had just completed a 5-
month course of prednisolone before the fracture, which re-
quired open reduction and internalﬁxation and aﬀected their
mobilization, because they had been using a walker (putting
weight on their upper limbs) before the fall and fracture oc-
currence. In this instance, we believe that this participant’s
fracture occurred as a consequence of SMA-related weakness,
which may have been exacerbated by prednisolone use. In
addition, functional outcomes may have been aﬀected by
SMA type. Finally, the eﬀect of prior treatment on the eﬃcacy
ﬁndings is also unclear.
The small number of participants in each cohort, hetero-
geneity of the patient population, and lack of a comparator
group represent study limitations, especially given that the
trajectory of SMA is aﬀected by age, weight, and comorbid-
ities.
20 In addition, further studies are required to better un-
derstand the underlying pathophysiology involved in the
prolonged aminotransferase elevations, which will guide fu-
ture management strategies.
The safety proﬁle for onasemnogene abeparvovec was similar
across weight groups in this heterogeneous population of
participants weighing up to 21 kg, although this required
a more prolonged exposure to corticosteroids and demon-
strated thrombocytopenia more often than expected, espe-
cially for those participants heavier than 13 kg. In addition, the
nature of the AEs was consistent with the existing clinical
evidence. Compared with previous clinical trials including
participants weighing <8.5 kg, there was increased frequency
of asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations and thrombo-
cytopenia, as well as longer duration of transaminase elevation
and related corticosteroid treatment in this study. Trans-
aminase elevations were manageable with the adequate use of
corticosteroids adapted on a case-by-case basis per the dis-
cretion of the treating physician. No participants developed
symptomatic liver involvement or met the Hy law criteria,
although mild transaminase elevations (ALT) above ULN
were present in 67% of participants at study end. Maintenance
or improvement of motor function was observed for most
participants, suggesting a clinical beneﬁt of IV onasemnogene
abeparvovec for heavier patients with SMA. Theseﬁndings
from the SMART study complement the increasing real-
world evidence of onasemnogene abeparvovec safety and ef-
ﬁcacy for patients with diﬀerent SMA types, those who are
treatment-na¨ıve or were previously treated with another
disease-modifying therapy, and those with a wider range of
ages and weights at baseline vs the previous onasemnogene
abeparvovec trial populations.
