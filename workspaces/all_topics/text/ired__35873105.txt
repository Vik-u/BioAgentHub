Imine reductases (IREDs) offer biocatalytic routes to chiral
amines and have a natural preference for the NADPH cofactor.
In previous work, we reported enzyme engineering of the (R)-
selective IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus (NADH-IRED-Ms)
yielding a NADH-dependent variant with high catalytic effi-
ciency. However, no IRED with NADH specificity and (S)-
selectivity in asymmetric reductions has yet been reported.
Herein, we applied semi-rational enzyme engineering to switch
the selectivity of NADH-IRED-Ms. The quintuple variant A241V/
H242Y/N243D/V244Y/A245L showed reverse stereopreference
in the reduction of the cyclic imine 2-methylpyrroline compared
to the wild-type and afforded the (S)-amine product with
> 99 % conversion and 91 % enantiomeric excess. We also
report the crystal-structures of the NADPH-dependent (R)-IRED-
Ms wild-type enzyme and the NADH-dependent NADH-IRED-Ms
variant and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationalize
the inverted stereoselectivity of the quintuple variant.
One of the most sophisticated catalytic properties of enzymes is
their excellent stereoselectivity when forming chiral products
from prochiral substrates. Structural analysis combined with
enzyme engineering aids in understanding the molecular basis
of stereoselectivity and provides tools to manipulate this
property for asymmetric transformations in organic chemistry.
In our ongoing efforts to develop enzymes for chiral amine
synthesis, we have investigated the asymmetric reduction of
prochiral imines and reductive amination with imine reductases
(IREDs). The studies with the (R)-selective IRED from Myxococcus
stipitatus ((R)-IRED-Ms) demonstrated the efficient formation of
various chiral nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
[1]
The extraordi-
narily broad substrate spectrum of (R)-IRED-Ms and its high
activity in double reductive aminations for piperazines is so far
unique. However, only (R)-products are accessible with this
enzyme and for some pharmaceutical building blocks, the
enantiocomplementary product is desired.
Although several (S)-selective IREDs have already been
described,
[2–12]
no IRED with stereocomplementary selectivity
and comparable substrate scope to (R)-IRED-Ms was identified.
Moreover, all characterized members of the IRED family natively
exhibit NADPH specificity. Cofactor regeneration systems in
engineered whole-cell systems would benefit from NADH-
dependent IREDs.
[13,14]
Recently, two successful strategies were
used to separately demonstrate the mutability of two (R)-
selective IREDs from Streptomyces sp. GF3587 and Myxococcus
stipitatus ((R)-IRED-Ms), which switch their cofactor preference
from NADPH to NADH.
[14–16]
To date, the enzyme family of IREDs includes more than
1100 members.
[6]
This family can be divided into two subfami-
lies, distinguished by their stereoselectivities; tentatively re-
ferred to as (R)- and (S)-IREDs.
[17]
A standard numbering scheme
for IREDs was introduced to predict (R)- or (S)-stereoselectivity
by a pendant residue in the active site, D or Y, respectively, at
standard position 178.
[6,17]
However, this approximate classifica-
tion cannot be applied to all IREDs, as different stereoselectiv-
ities have been described depending on the substrate.
[12,18]
This
is illustrated by recently characterized IREDs that were found to
be (S)-selective despite having aspartic acid as a pendant
residue in the active site.
[19,20]
In addition, single-point variants
of the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis displayed inverted
stereoselectivity compared to the wild-type.
[21]
Despite exten-
sive studies of IREDs,
[12,16,18,22–26]
the molecular mechanism of
asymmetric imine reduction and, if relevant, imine protonation,
remains unclear.
[27]
One mechanism has been proposed for the
IRED subfamily of fungal reductive aminases (RedAms). Residues
D169 and Y177 (standard positions 187 and 195) have been
suggested to be involved in both protonation and deprotona-
tion of reaction intermediates.
[21,28,29]
Furthermore, conforma-
tional changes in cofactor binding indicate a significantly
reduced volume of the substrate-binding site in closed enzyme-
cofactor complexes.
[10,30,31]
Unfortunately, the lack of ternary
enzyme-cofactor-substrate complexes with imine substrates
hinders a detailed mechanistic understanding.
[27]
These issues
are associated with highly flexible regions and domain move-
ments that lead to conformational changes,

unresolved binding-site loops and the missing nicotinamide
ring of the NADPH cofactor in the ternary enzyme-cofactor-
product complex of the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis.
[33]
Herein, we report the iterative successive engineering of the
(R)-selective NADH-variant of the IRED from Myxococcus
stipitatus (NADH-IRED-Ms) towards inverted stereoselectivity in
the asymmetric reduction of the cyclic imine 2-methylpyrroline.
We also used X-ray structure determination and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to rationalize the structural basis of
the switched cofactor specificity and inversion in stereoselectiv-
ity, respectively.
The crystal structures of (R)-IRED-Ms (PDB code: 6TO4) and
NADH-IRED-Ms (PDB code: 6TOE) were determined in complex
with NADP
+
and NAD
+
, respectively. The NADH-specific variant
NADH-IRED-Ms encompassed the mutations N32E/R33Y/T34E/
K37R/L67I/T71V. The solved structures exhibit the canonical
IRED fold
[24]
with an N-terminal Rossmann domain connected to
a C-terminal helical bundle via a long interdomain helix.
Two monomers form a dimer, with the N-terminal domain
of one monomer and the C-terminal domain of the other
forming an active-site pocket that contain the cofactor (Fig-
ure 1A). Comparison of the (R)-IRED-Ms monomer with other
IREDs in the PDB using the DALI server
[34,35]
revealed closest-
structural homology to (R)-IRED-Sr from Streptosporangium
roseum (PDB code: 5OCM;
[31]
36 % sequence identity; rmsd 2.1 Å
over 286 Cα atoms). Analysis of the cofactor binding loop
recognizing the 2’-phosphate of NADP
+
revealed prominent
interactions between this group and the side chains of N32,
R33, T34 and K37 (Figure 1B). Superposition of the structure of
NADH-IRED-Ms in complex with NAD
+
(Figure 1C) revealed
changes in enzyme-cofactor interactions. Accordingly, the
carboxylate introduced at position 32 interacts with the free
ribose hydroxyls of the NAD
+
ribose. The residue Y33, which
replaces arginine, is no longer in close contact with the ribose.
However, it fulfils a stacking interaction function with the
adenine ring system, as with R33 in the wild-type. The lack of
interaction of the new side chains of E34 and R37 with ribose
hydroxyls is reflected in their mobility, resulting in poorer
electron density for these side chains in the NADH-IRED-Ms
NAD
+
structure.
To identify targets for mutagenesis, the active sites of
stereocomplementary IREDs were compared to identify amino
acid that mediate stereoselectivity. The best-known residue in
(R)-IRED_Ms is D171 (standard numbering position 178), which
is also described as a catalytically active amino acid. Most (R)-
selective IREDs have an aspartic acid at this position, in contrast
to tyrosine in most (S)-selective IREDs. The function of the
conserved aspartic acid or tyrosine is still unclear although
exchanging this residue for alanine or phenylalanine resulted in
enzymes with greatly reduced activity.
[6,11,23]
To switch the stereoselectivity of (R)-IRED_Ms, D171 was first
chosen as the target site for saturation mutagenesis. The
resulting D171X variants (including D171Y) showed little or no
catalytic activity, indicating the key role of this residue in the
catalytic cycle. Similarly, the site-saturation mutagenesis at
other positions reported to be essential for (S)-selectivity of
IREDs did not result in altered stereoselectivity of NADH-IRED-
Ms (Table S1).
We next applied site-directed mutagenesis of (R)-IRED_Ms
to randomize the residues at positions 123, 171 and 178, which
have been described in literature to play a role in determining
the stereoselectivity of IREDs.
[6,12,17]
We performed a multiple
sequence alignment of 31 different stereocomplementary IREDs
(12 (S)- and 19 (R)-selective IREDs, Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information).

Mutant libraries were analyzed by monitoring the depletion
of the NADH cofactor in 96-well microtiter plates. Furthermore,
saturation mutagenesis of V212, the equivalent position of
W210 of the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis, the mutation of
which has been shown to invert stereoselectivity,
[33]
was also
unsuccessful in altering this property in (R)-IRED-Ms. We there-
fore concluded that further enzyme engineering of different
residues may be required to alter the enzymatic discrimination
of the re- and si-faces of the prochiral imine.
Structural information obtained from the crystal structures
of NADH-IRED-Ms in complex with NADH was used to identify
amino acids near the cofactor (Table S2). Subsequent screening
of (limited) site-saturation mutagenesis libraries that included
position 13, 95, 120–124, 171, 175, 178, 212, 237, 241, 242, and
245 identified the mutation A245 C, which slightly decreased
the stereoselectivity. Therefore, a second mutant library was
constructed by randomizing residues in the region 240–246
(standard positions 256–259) and combining them into pairs
(Table S3) to account for synergistic effects. Screening revealed
a double variant A241V/H242Y that formed slightly less (R)-
enantiomeric product. Finally, further exchanges (see Table S3)
in the active site revealed that mutations in a specific region
(A241–A245) contributed to changes in stereoselectivity (Fig-
ure 2). While a point mutation A245 L showed significant
deterioration in stereoselectivity, the combination of five
mutations in this region A241V/H242Y/N243D/V244Y/A245L
(variant designated (S)-NADH_V11) switched stereoselectivity
from > 99 % ee (R) to 91 % ee (S) in the reduction of 2-
methylpyrroline (1). Besides imine 1, three additional imines
methyl- (2) and phenyl piperideine (3) as well as 1-methyl-3,4-
dihydroisoquinoline (4) were transformed to the corresponding
amine products (1 a-4 a) using the (S)-NADH_V11 variant
(Table 1). It is worth noting that the final variant comprising 11
mutations had reduced stability and expression levels were also
poorer.

V11, ternary enzyme-NADH-substrate complexes of both var-
iants were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
The resulting trajectories were examined for close contacts
between potentially proton-donating residues (Table S7) and
the imine nitrogen atom of the substrate.
Analysis of all replicates of six molecular systems (see
Supporting Information) identified three residues that interact
with the substrate’s imine nitrogen: S95, D171 and W179. This
finding underscores the functional relevance of the previously
proposed imine-polarizing flanking residues, the conventional
proton donor, and the putative alternative proton donor (IRED
standard positions 112, 187, and 195, respectively).
[27]
For all
three residues, the respective stereoselectivity was assessed by
classifying the orientation of the bound 2-methylpyrroline
molecule with respect to the nearest hydride of NADH (Table 2).
The stereopreference of NADH-IRED-Ms_2 and (S)-NADH_V11_2
evaluated by the simulations was consistent with that observed
experimentally. To further investigate the molecular basis of
stereopreference, the ternary enzyme-cofactor-substrate com-
plex with the smallest distance between proton donor and
substrate was selected for each enzyme.
Interestingly, the differences in stereopreference were
caused by two distinct binding modes with a mirror-image
orientation of the nicotinamide group relative to the planar
imine moiety (Figures 3A and B). While in NADH-IRED-Ms, the
nicotinamide moiety is oriented towards the helical dimeriza-
tion area, in (S)-NADH_V11 it is oriented towards the Rossmann
fold. The two different binding modes are caused by a rotation
of a helix in the substrate-binding site (residues 241–245) by an
angle of 15 degrees. The introduced mutations trigger this
structural difference in the corresponding helical region. This

shifts the nicotinamide-binding loop projecting into the binding
pocket. The nicotinamide is stabilized differently in the two
enzymes (Figure S6).
Hydrogen bonding between D171 and S95 was observed in
both enzymes, supporting the previously proposed functional
role of ‘imine-polarizing’ flanking-residues.
[27]
The higher fre-
quency of a D171-S95 hydrogen bond in simulation system
NADH-IRED-Ms_2 compared to (S)-NADH_V11_2 (Figure 3C) is
consistent with the higher catalytic activity of NADH-IRED-Ms.
However, it cannot be excluded that destabilizing effects of the
introduced mutations cause this effect. In this context, the
importance of the local electrostatic fine-tuning, the need for
proper pK
a
matching, and the potential occurrence of proton-
relays in IREDs are highlighted.
According to these results, a catalytic dyad seems to be
useful for proton donation in D-type
[12,27]
IREDs. In general, this
dyad consists of an aspartic acid (standard position 187) and a
flanking serine/threonine residue (standard position 111). In
addition to an active role in proton donation, the passive
functionality of these residues could enable the necessary
protonation. In this scenario, the catalysis could occur by
positioning of the C = N double bond of the imine at a polar site
in the otherwise predominantly non-polar binding pocket and
by proton transfer from water molecules that are also
approximated. A similar mode of operation could apply to Y-
type
[12,27]
IREDs. A catalytic triad consisting of tyrosine, serine
and asparagine would also provide electrostatic fine-tuning. In
particular, similar patterns in reasonable proximity to the
cofactor could facilitate protonation.
[8,30]
Conversely, some residues in the large binding sites of IREDs
could contribute to unproductive binding modes that limit
overall catalytic efficiency. This could be the case for W179
(standard position 195) in NADH-IRED-Ms and (S)-NADH_V11.
The simulations performed indicate that the amine hydrogen of
the indole moiety most frequently interacts with the imine
nitrogen atom. Based on this observation, we speculate that
this nonproductive binding mode may limit the catalytic
efficiency of various IREDs. The previously described 8-fold
increased activity of variant W191 A of IR45 from Streptomyces
aurantiacus supports this conjecture.
[38]
However, we cannot
rule out the possibility that this observation is substrate
dependent or that similar mutations have a negative impact on
the stereoselectivities in other IREDs. Such effects have been
reported for the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis, as the
Y179F and Y179 A variants resulted in inverted stereoselectivity
in the reduction of multiple substrates.
[30]
The high sequence
variability, large size, and conformational flexibility of the
substrate-binding pockets of IREDs provide many degrees of
freedom for electrostatic fine-tuning of the active site. Despite
this variability, IREDs exhibit remarkably high stereoselectivity.
Moreover, the role of flexible regions in catalysis complicates
the analysis of the determinants of stereoselectivity using X-ray
structural data.
[32]
In contrast, MD simulations are widely used as
a valuable method to analyze biochemical properties of flexible
proteins on the molecular level.
[39,40]
In addition, simulation-
based engineering approaches can provide the necessary time
and cost efficiency for chiral amine production on an industrial
scale. An example of this is the production of, for example, 1,4-
diazepanes by the pteridine reductase 1 from Leishmania major,
an imine-reducing member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase family.
[41]
In summary, we demonstrate the engineering of NADH-
IRED-Ms to yield a variant with high (S)-selectivity and NADH
specificity in the asymmetric reduction of substrate 2-meth-
ylpyrroline. Targeted mutagenesis of a specific region in the
IRED substrate-binding pocket and the combination of muta-
tions was key to achieving the switched selectivity. Five
additional mutations in the variant NADH-IRED-Ms were
sufficient to obtain a (S)-selective variant with 91 % ee.
Determining the structure of the NADH-dependent imine
reductase variant and using it for MD simulations also allowed
rationalization of the altered stereopreference. Thus, the MD
simulations underscore the effectiveness of this method to gain
a deeper understanding of the substrate-binding behavior of
IREDs, which was previously limited by the lack of substrate
complexes.
