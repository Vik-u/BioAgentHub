Abstract: Biocatalysis is now a well-established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and
designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been
developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone into an amine or alcohol, and do
not result in the generation of signiﬁcant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme-triggered reaction cascade
methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3-rich molecules in one step. Herein,
we describe a single-step biocatalytic route to high-value, complex indolizidine, and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies
on a transaminase-triggered double intramolecular aza-Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally
complex, natural-product-like N-heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme-
triggered reactions. Signiﬁcantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase
plays a dual role in generating complexN-heterocycles and where a retro-double intramolecular aza-Michael reaction
mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3-rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing ﬁve
stereocenters, as single isomers.
In recent years, biocatalysis has made possible a wealth
of novel chemistry not previously accessible, thanks to the
unrivalled regio-, chemo- and stereoselectivity associated
with enzymes.[1,2] Approximately 40% of the top 200 small
molecule drugs by retail sales in 2022 contain one or more
chiral amine moieties in their structures,[3] yet traditional
approaches for synthesising these amines often rely on pre-
cious metal catalysts, employed at elevated temperatures and
in environmentally harmful solvents.[4,5] A growing demand
for more sustainable synthetic methodology has spearheaded
the discovery and development of enzymes for numerous
transformations, not least for the asymmetric synthesis of
optically pure amines.[6,7]

Substituted N-heterocycles are important building blocks
for many natural products, pharmaceuticals, and other indus-
trially relevant chemicals. When synthesisingN-heterocyclic
compounds, installation of the (chiral) amine moiety is often
the most straightforward synthetic approach, and given the
importance of these nitrogen-containing molecules, there
have been several enzymes discovered and developed for
their asymmetric preparation. [8–16] A prominent class of
enzymes for amine synthesis are theω-transaminases (TAs),
which rely on a pyridoxyl-5-phosphate coenzyme to mediate
the reversible transfer of an amino group from a sacriﬁcial
amine donor to an amine acceptor. Although TAs, like
many enzymes, are traditionally employed for their ability
to mediate functional group interconversions (FGIs) with
unrivalled selectivity, some biocatalytic methodologies have
been developed that extend beyond single FGIs to encompass
innovative and complexity-generating methodologies, such as
multi-step chemoenzymatic cascades and the application of
enzymes to trigger subsequent cascade reactions.[17]
Among the N-heterocycles, quinolizidine,- and
indolizidine-containing alkaloids represent a class of
azabicyclic compounds that have gained signiﬁcant interest
due to their low natural abundance and interesting biological
activities (Scheme 1a).[18,19] However, many total syntheses
targeting these alkaloid scaffolds involve step-by-step
syntheses, where chirality is either introduced into the
molecule in an asymmetric reaction, or assembled from chiral
building blocks, with the potential for scrambling of the
installed stereocentre requiring constant monitoring.[20] One
synthetic strategy that has found widespread application for
the preparation of heterocycles bearing nitrogen-substituted

stereocentres is the intramolecular aza-Michael reaction
(IMAMR).[21] The reaction relies on the conjugate addition
of nitrogen nucleophiles, and due to the spontaneous nature
of the reaction, obtaining a stable starting material, where
both the nitrogen nucleophile and electrophile coexist in an
unreactive substrate so as not to compromise selectivity, has
been a major obstacle. Although the double intramolecular
aza-Michael reaction (DIMAMR) is a powerful approach
for accessing quinolizidine alkaloids, it faces the same set
of challenges as the single IMAMR equivalent. Strategies
typically rely on employing a nucleophile with diminished
reactivity, such as sulﬁnamides and carbamates.[22–24]
Building upon methodology developed in our group,[12]
we describe an enzyme-induced DIMAMR for the for-
mation of quinolizidine- and indolizidine-containing com-
pounds, starting from suitably designed dienone precursors
(Scheme 1b). The spontaneous double cyclisation is initiated
by the regio- and stereoselective installation of a chiral amine
nucleophile using a TA, and represents the ﬁrst example of an
enzyme-triggered DIMAMR. Furthermore, the reversibility
of the non-stereoselective aza-Michael reaction, combined
with the substrate selectivity of a second TA, is used
to showcase an enzyme-triggered DIMAMR coupled to a
double retro aza-Michael dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR)
for the asymmetric installation of ﬁve chiral centres in a
one-pot cascade (Scheme1c).
To test the feasibility of using TA-triggered DIMAMR
methodology to access complex heterocycles, a panel of nine
novel dienone substrates (1a-i, Figure 1) were synthesised
and tested with a selection of commercially availableω-TA
biocatalysts from Codexis, where two enzymes with comple-
mentary stereoselectivity were selected. The substrates were
prepared from commercially available methyl ketones (see
Supporting Information for full details) and were designed
to ensure that, following enzymatic amination, the desired
reactive intermediate would form, thereby spontaneously
inducing a DIMAMR. The substrates were selected to target
known natural product scaffolds, with1e-f being designed to
obtain precursors for lasubine or subcosine analogues,[25,26]
and 1a-d targeting the analogues of the psychostimulant drug
gephyrotoxin.[27,28]
Following initial optimisation of the biotransformation
conditions using 1a as the model substrate (Table S1),
ketoenones (1a-i) were evaluated with (S)-selective ATA256
(Scheme 2a), which for substrates1a-f were aminated at the
methyl or ethyl ketone regioselectively.
As previously shown, any amination at the enone carbonyl
is shuttled back to the productive aza-Michael substrate2a-
f.[12,16] Once formed, these reactive chiral amines2 undergo
an initial IMAMR to give the corresponding 2,5-disubstituted
pyrrolidines 3 (n = 1) or 2,6-disubstituted piperidines 3
(n = 2), which then undergo a second IMAMR to form

the indolizidine 4 (n = 1) or quinolizidine 4 (n = 2)
products, respectively. Most likely due to substrate instability,
the substrates 1g-i decomposed under biotransformation
conditions and no product (4g-i) formation was observed in
these reactions. The biotransformation products presented
in Scheme 2 are novel compounds, with no prior literature
references available for their structural analyses. All isomers
from the mixtures of 4a, 4c, 4e,a n d 4f were puriﬁed
or enriched by ﬂash column chromatography with neutral
alumina as the stationary phase in order to characterise
the diastereomeric composition of the mixtures by 1D and
2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. Due to the stereochemical
complexity of the mixture of tricyclic compounds, the struc-
ture elucidation of 4a and 4c was further corroborated by
proton proximity calculations for all possible stereoisomers
(see Supporting Information for full set of calculations). We
also showed that the methodology is scalable for preparative
synthesis up to 250 mg of product. With ATA256 we could
access the ethyl derivatives4b and 4d as a mixture of four
diastereoisomers. Peak overlap in the1H NMR spectra did,
however, not allow for the accurate calculation of thed.r.
From analysis of the biotransformation products, we made
three key observations. First, the indolizidines and quino-
lizidines 4 displayed a signiﬁcant difference in the second
aza-Michael cyclisation reaction. In the case of pyrrolidines
3 (n = 1), the second IMAMR was rapid, resulting in the
formation of the indolizidine products4 (n = 1) exclusively.
For piperidines 3 (n = 2), however, both the quinolizidines
4 (n = 2), arising from the second IMAMR, and the
intermediate 2,6-cis-disubstituted piperidines3 (n = 2) were
isolated from the biotransformations. The slower cyclisation
observed with the piperidines 3 (n = 2) compared to the
pyrrolidines 3 (n = 1) can be rationalised by the difference in
nucleophilicity between the pyrrolidine and piperidine nitro-
gen, and this allowed us to isolate and characterise the “single
aza-Michael” products (i.e., (S,S)-3a,( R,R)-3a,( S,S)-3e,a n d
(R,R)-3e). Only the cis-2,6-disubstituted piperidines were
observed in the crude reaction mixtures, and we hypothesised
that this is due to a retro aza-Michael epimerisation from the
trans-2,6-disubstituted piperidines to the more thermodynam-
ically stable cis-isomer under biotransformation conditions,
and/or because the second aza-Michael reaction is more

favourable for thetrans-2,6-disubstituted piperidine, leaving
behind thecis-isomer as one of the reaction products. The lat-
ter was evident in the formation of the aromatic quinolizidine
4e, which arises from the unobservedtrans-2,6-disubstituted
piperidine (S,R)-3e (Scheme 3a). However, an in situ epimeri-
sation was most likely the faster reaction given the signiﬁcant
amount of (S,S)-3e observed in the crude biotransformation
mixture (3e:4e 4:1, Scheme2). Retro aza-Michael epimerisa-

4e, the stereoselective outcome from the second aza-Michael
reaction also appeared to be substrate controlled for products
4a-d (Scheme 2). This was evident from the equivalent
stereochemical pattern of puriﬁed isomers (1S)-4a/4c and
(1R)-4a/4c, produced with an (S)-selective and (R)-selective
TA, respectively (Scheme 3c). The additional substrate-
controlled selectivity was rationalised by identifying the
most favourable transition states of the second aza-Michael
reaction (see Supporting Information for more information).
Thirdly, the tertiaryα-carbon of the tricyclic double aza-
Michael products (4a/4c) readily interconverted between (S)-
and (R)-conﬁgurations when treated with silica or basic
alumina (Scheme 3d). The (S)-selective ATA256 catalysed
reaction allowed for the isolation of (1S,3aS,9aS)-4c con-
sisting of two diastereomers and of the enantiomerically
pure (1 S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-4c (Scheme 3c), in which the α-
epimerisation provided the more thermodynamically stable
(trans-fused) 5aS,9aS-isomer (see Supporting Information
for calculated energy differences between cis- and trans-
fused isomers 5a-9a). Conversely, the opposite enantiomers
(1R,3aR,9aR)-4c and (1R,3aS,5aR,9aR)-4c were isolated from

the biotransformation catalysed by the (R)-selective ATA025,
and equivalent trends were observed for the tricyclic quino-
lizidines 4a.
Having established TA methodology that goes far beyond
the typical FGIs, enabling the generation of a panel of
complex heterocycles from simple non-chiral substrates, we
next wanted to demonstrate that the enzyme could be used for
further complexity generation. From the four stereocentres
installed in the TA-triggered DIMAMR (Scheme4a), two
centres were controlled by the enzyme’s selectivity: C1
installed in the TA catalysed amination reaction, and the
centre installed in the second aza-Michael reaction, which was
under substrate control and thus indirectly controlled by the
enzyme. We envisioned that the two unresolved stereocentres,
the tertiary α-carbon and the β-carbon set in the ﬁrst aza-
Michael reaction, could be resolved in a TA catalysed DKR,
via a base promoted double retro aza-Michael racemisation
(Scheme 4b). This type of racemisation had been observed
when we attempted to epimerise the 4f diastereomeric
mixture under basic conditions (see Supporting Information).
We therefore decided to record the stereoselective out-
come from subjecting the puriﬁed isomer (1S,3 aS,9 aS)-4c
to the same conditions used during the biotransformation
reactions but with no enzyme present (Scheme4c). Pleasingly,
after aging the compound in buffer at pH 9.0 for 24 h at
50 °C, the double retro aza-Michael racemisation was evident
by the formation of product (3aR-4c) where C-3a displayed
(R)-conﬁguration, as determined by1H NMR spectroscopic
analysis, although this process was accompanied by some
decomposition. Enzymatic DKR processes via α-carbonyl
racemisation are well established in the literature,[29–31] and a
TA-mediated retro aza-Michael DKR was presented by Peng
et al. i nt h es y n t h e s i so fad r u gp r e c u r s o r .[32] However, an
enzymatic double retro aza-Michael DKR has (to the best of
our knowledge) not been reported.
We continued our investigation into the proposed
enzymatic DKR by screening a panel of commercial
TAs known to accept more sterically encumbered ketone
substrates,[33] using the diastereomeric mixture4c produced
from the TA-triggered DIMAMR methodology as our model
compound (see Supporting Information for full results from
the screening). From the panel, the two enzymes ATA234 and
CDX043 were identiﬁed as capable of efﬁcient amination of
diastereomers 4c (Scheme 4d). NMR spectroscopic analysis of
the major product from preparative scale reactions, revealed
the accumulation of (1S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-5c in 40% isolated
yield. Both enzymes (ATA234 and CDX043) demonstrated
the ability to discriminate between the conﬁgurational

isomers, selectively accepting the trans-fused indolizidine
(1S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-4c to form diamine (1 S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-5c
with moderate C-5 selectivity. The two C-5 isomers could be
readily separated by ﬂash column chromatography. Epimeri-
sation of theβ-carbon C-3a was furthermore veriﬁed when we
obtained the same stereoisomeric product (1S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-
5c, with the (R)-conﬁgured C-3a, from the ATA234 catalysed
biotransformation of puriﬁed (1S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-4c, containing
the (S)-conﬁgured C-3a (Scheme4d, please see Section 5 in
the Supporting Information for details).[34]
Next, the ketoenone precursor1c was tested with ATA-
256 and ATA-234 in a one-pot two enzyme reaction, yielding
the major aminated product (1S,3aR,5aS,9aS)-5c, represent-
ing a truly unique example of a one-pot dual-role ATA-DKR
cascade, in which a prochiral substrate is converted to a chiral
natural product scaffold with ﬁve stereocentres under enzyme
DKR and substrate control (Scheme5). When the cascade
was tested with ketoenone1a, a single enantiomerically pure
aminated product (1 S,5aR,6S,6aS,10aS)-5a was obtained,
meaning that the ATA-234 can also selectively discriminate
between the four quinolizidine stereoisomers (1S)-4a in a
resolution process and additionally install the primary amine
with high stereoselectivity (Scheme5). Interestingly, no DKR
was observed for this substrate under the biotransformation
conditions. From the cascade reaction,5a was separated from
the remaining DIMAMR products3a and 4a a n da c q u i r e di n
10% isolated yield and>99% e.e.
In conclusion, we have developed the ﬁrst single-step
biocatalytic route to high-value indolizidine and quinolizidine
moieties, demonstrated the ﬁrst example of an enzyme-
triggered DIMAMR, and established a one-pot two enzyme
cascade capable of converting simple prochiral starting
materials into highly complex novelN-heterocycles contain-
ing up to ﬁve chiral centres; all achieved with a high degree
of regio-, chemo-, and stereoselectivity. This work expands
the repertoire of enzyme-triggered reaction methodologies
as well as enzymatic cascade processes, representing a truly
unique example of a dual role TA cascade. Despite the
success of the methodology, challenges remain, particularly
in achieving complete double cyclisation for the quinolizidine
systems. Additionally, the further development of the double
retro aza-Michael DKR process could signiﬁcantly enhance
the utility of this methodology. Screening or engineering
a more selective TA for the amination of one DIMAMR
product would strengthen the impact of the DKR process
dramatically. This would yield a highly enantioselective
process capable of obtaining a single indolizidine- or
quinolizidine-containing product with ﬁve chiral centres, all
achieved in a one-pot cascade, eliminating many of the inefﬁ-
ciencies associated with traditional, multistep methodologies
including the need for stepwise stereocontrol, protecting
groups and intermediate puriﬁcation steps, increasing the
overall sustainability and practicality of the methodology.
