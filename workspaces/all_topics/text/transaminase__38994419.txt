Key structural features to favour imines over
hydrates in water: pyridoxal phosphate as a muse†
Ferran Esteve, * Tanguy Rieu and Jean-Marie Lehn *
Imination reactions in water represent a challenge not only because of the high propensity of imines to be
hydrolysed but also as a result of the competing hydrate formation through H2O addition to the aldehyde. In
the present work we report a successful approach that allows for favouring imitation reactions while
silencing hydrate formation. Such remarkable reactivity and selectivity can be attained byﬁne-tuning the
electronic and steric structural features of theortho-substituents of the carbonyl groups. It resulted from
studying the structure–reactivity relationships in a series of condensation reactions between diﬀerent
amines and aldehydes, comparing the results to the ones obtained in the presence of the biologically-
relevant pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). The key role of negatively-charged and sterically-crowding units (i.e.,
sulfonate groups) in disfavouring hydrate formation was corroborated by DFT and steric-hindrance
calculations. Furthermore, the best-performing aldehyde leads to higher imine yields, selectivity and
stability than those ofPLP itself, allowing for the inhibition of aPLP-dependent enzyme (transaminase)
through dynamic aldimine exchange. These results will increase the applicability of imine-based dynamic
covalent chemistry (DCvC) under physiological conditions and will pave the way for the design of new
carbonyl derivatives that might be used in the dynamic modiﬁcation of biomolecules.
Introduction
Imine-based dynamic covalent reactions have oﬀered remark-
able advantages in a wide range of elds.1–3 The reversible
nature of aldimine covalent bonds allows for
thermodynamically-driven dynamic rearrangements and error-
checking processes,
4 with the species (or mixture) that pres-
ents the lowest free energy predominating in equilibrium under
specic conditions.
5–8 Such dynamicity proved useful for the
development of systems displaying a behaviour of higher
complexity.9–11 Nevertheless, the high propensity of imines to be
hydrolysed in aqueous media has hampered their application
under physiological conditions.
12 As a consequence, many
research eﬀorts have been devoted in the last years toward the
implementation of chemical methods that increase the stability
of imines in water, mainly using covalent/supramolecular
multivalency and hydrophobic eﬀects.
13–17 In nature, imitation
reactions are achieved in the sophisticatedly-arranged active
sites of enzymes, using pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as the alde-
hyde.18 The mode-of-action of this cofactor has been extensively
studied as it plays an essential role in numerous enzymatic
processes ( e.g., racemizations, transaminations, aldol
cleavages, and decarboxylations).
19,20 Briey, the pyridine ring
acts as an electron sink to enhance the electrophilic character of
the carbonyl group; the –OH group in ortho-position to the
carbonyl unit is involved in amine activation and imine stabi-
lization through H-bonding/electrostatic attractions; and the
phosphate sidechain mainly acts as the anchoring scaﬀold to
the protein's active site through multiple supramolecular
interactions.
21–23 Thus, the high e ﬃciency of PLP-assisted
transformations suggests that aldimine formation and tran-
simination reactions can be attained under physiological
conditions when the system is properly designed. Despite that
a handful of studies showed how supramolecular and electronic
interactions can be used to increase imine stability,
24–28 the
structural features to favour aldimine over the competing
hydrate formation in water have been quite overseen.
Herein we report a successful approach to increase imine
yields while preventing the hydration of the aldehyde by taking
advantage of the supramolecular, electronic, and steric prefer-
ences of each reaction component (aldehyde, amine, hydroxide/
water), intermediate (hemiaminal), and product (hydrate,
imine, iminium). Besides, the best-performing aldehyde acts as
an inhibitor of the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase likely
through dynamic aldimine exchange with thePLP cofactor.
Results and discussion
One notes that increasing the electrophilic character of the
aldehyde (e.g., electron-withdrawing substituents) is the most

commonly used method to increase imine yields. However, this
approach also favours the H 2O addition to the activated
carbonyl that generates the hydrate, decreasing the aldimine
selectivity (Fig. 1A). We envisaged that the introduction of
negatively-charged bulky groups near the carbonyl unit may
disfavour the hydrate formation due to electrostatic repulsions

and crowding e ﬀects. Accordingly, sulfonate groups were
selected, also taking into account their electron-withdrawing
character that could further favour imine formation.
The propensity of a series of benzaldehyde derivatives (AX,
Fig. 1B) and PLP to form hydrates was rst assayed in D2O
(5 mM aldehyde, pD 7.0, 50 mM PBS). AldehydesA12–A15 were
then synthesized in one-step following reported procedures (see
ESI† for details).
29 The Hammett plot of the apparent hydration
equilibrium constants (Khyd) showed the expected increase in
hydrate formation for the aldehydes containing more electron-
withdrawing substituents (higher Hammett values) with a slope
of 1.7 (e.g., A0 < A6 < A2 < A8 < A4 < A9, Fig. 1C and Table S1;† see
also Fig. 1D),
30,31 in good agreement with previous reports.32
Interestingly, however, the species containing two sulfonate
groups in ortho-position led to signicantly lower K
hyd than
aldehydes with similar Hammet values (see for instanceA11 vs.
A2 in Fig. 1D), suggesting a destabilizing e ﬀect of these
negatively-charged bulky groups towards hydrate formation.
The eﬀect of pD on the aldehyde hydration was also assessed.
Dissolving the aldehydes at pD 0.6 resulted in the expected
increase in hydrate formation forPLP, A2, A3, A4, andA9 due to
the protonation of their pyridine nitrogen site (Fig. S1†). In
contrast, pyridinium A14 was barely hydrated under these
conditions despite its great Hammett score (3.27), stressing that
the sulfonate groups were disfavouring aldehyde hydration. The
hydrate abundance of the other aldehydes did not signicantly
change at such acidic pD. An increase in the pD of the solution
to 10.6 led to minor diﬀerences when compared to the results
obtained at pD 7.0 (Fig. S2†). At pD 13.6, hydrate abundances
$95% were obtained forA2, A3, A4, A6, A7, A8, andA9 (Fig. S3†),
but no hydration was observed forPLP, A1, A5, and A10–A15,
corroborating the key role of bulky and/or negatively-charged
ortho-substituents in preventing hydrate formation.
We then screened the imine formation reactions by studying
the apparent equilibrium constants (K
im) for the cholamine
chloride (B1) addition to the di ﬀerent aldehydes, since its
terminal –NH2 group is barely protonated at such pD.33 In
general, the Kim increased with higher Hammet scores.
Notwithstanding, the non-linearity of the results gave insight
into the key structural features to favour imines over hydrates
(Fig. 1E and F, see also Fig. S4 and S5†):
(i) Aldehydes with small and neutral electron-withdrawing
groups (i.e., A2–A4, A6–A9) do not eﬀectively form imines due
to signicant competing hydrate formation (Fig. 1F; see also
grey tting in Fig. S5†).
(ii) Aldehydes with bulky and negatively-charged ortho-
substituents (i.e., A10–A14) barely form hydrates and give high
K
im, leading to remarkable imine-to-hydrate selectivities
(Fig. S4;† see also browntting in Fig. S5†). In addition, these
negative groups might also be involved in the stabilization of
the potential iminium cations through attractive electrostatic
interactions and H-bonding.
22
(iii) Salicylaldehyde derivatives (viz. A1, A5 and PLP) promote
relatively highKim despite their low Hammett values of−0.37,
−0.03 and 0.34, respectively (Fig. 1F; see also yellowtting in
Fig. S5†).34 This behaviour is ascribed to the presence of
intramolecular H-bonding and electrostatic forces that stabilize
the aldimine/aldiminium.20,22,23,35
(iv) The combination of (ii) and (iii), as in the case ofA15,
leads to the highest Kim with excellent aldimine selectivities
(Fig. 1F and S4†).
One notes that the abundance of hydrate and imine when
using aldehydes with small and neutral electron-withdrawing
groups is rather similar, indicating that the diﬀerence in ener-
gies of formation for such products is small (e.g., A9, A4, A7, A8).
On the other hand, this energy diﬀerence is much greater in
favor of the imine/iminium for aldehydes containing ortho-
substituents that can stabilize such aldimine/aldiminium
bonds by means of supramolecular interactions (see for
instance DFT section below).
The K
im dependence on the pD was also assayed to evaluate
the applicability of the sulfonate-containing aldehydes at
diﬀerent pH ranges. Remarkably, theK
im for A15 was almost 10-
times higher than that ofPLP all over the biologically-relevant
pD range ( i.e., 6.5 –7.8), with imine abundances >90%
(Fig. S6†). At lower pD values (<5.5), the addition ofB1 to the
diﬀerent aldehydes was hampered by the complete protonation
of the terminal –NH2 of the amine (Fig. S7 and S8†). As ex-
pected, higher pD decreased the protonation ofB1 and resulted
in greater Kim for A0, in agreement with previous reports.23 In
contrast, aldehydes containing sulfonate (viz. A10, A12, A13, A13
and A15) and/or phenolate (A1, A5, PLP and A15) units inortho-
position showed a decrease in imine formation at pD > 8.5
(Fig. S7 and S8†). We hypothesized that thesendings could be
related to the iminium/imine equilibrium and its eﬀect on the
dynamic covalent reaction. The high d values (>8.6 ppm)
observed for the–CH]N– signals of these aldehydes suggested
the presence of the corresponding iminium cations, in line with
reported results.
23 We thus attempted to determine the pKa of
the iminium cations (p Ka,iminium)b y 1H-NMR spectroscopy
through the d changes in the –CH]N– signal (Fig. S9 †).
However, the only species that experienced a signicant shi in
the –CH]N– signal were A5 and PLP/A15, giving pKa,iminium
values of ca. 8 and 10.5, respectively. For these aldehydes, the
Kim drastically dropped once the pD of the solution overtook
their pKa,iminium, suggesting a much higher thermodynamic
stability of the iminium cations over that of the imines. In
contrast, the–CH]N– signal for theB1-condensation products
with the aldehydesA10, A11, A12, A13 and A14 barely shied
even at quite high pD, but theirKim still decreased to almost 0.
Hence, we rationalized that the pD value where theKim dropped
corresponded to the pKa,iminium, and that the stability of the
unprotonated imines must be lower than those ofPLP and A15,
as no NMR shi indicative of imine formation was observed at
pD > pKa,iminium.
DFT calculations were performed for the hydrate, hemi-
aminal, imine and iminium derived fromA12 (sulfonate groups
in bothortho-positions) to shed light on the iminium-to-hydrate
selectivity observed experimentally (Fig. 2A). The energetic
proles showed endergonic processes for the formation of the
species presenting a Csp
3 hybridization: hydrate and hemi-
aminal. This indicated that the sterically-crowded microenvi-
ronment of the carbonyl unit preferred a Csp

conformation rather than the bulkier Csp3 tetrahedral cong-
urations of the hydrate and hemiaminal.36 The preference for
C–O vs. C–N release/cleavage from the tetrahedral intermediates
may also involve stereoelectronic eﬀects.37,38 Whereas the imine
A12B1 presented a subtly exergonic free energy of formation
(−1.5 kcal mol−1), a much stronger stabilization was observed
on generation of the iminium derivative ( DG =
−13.6 kcal mol−1), in accordance with the experimental results.
Such exergonic energies were assigned to the recovery of the
sterically-suitable Csp
2 hybridization in theA12–B1 condensa-
tion products, with additional electrostatic, H-bonding andn
/ p* interactions stabilizing the iminium cation.27,39
The role of then /p* and H-bond interactions was further
studied through natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses to esti-
mate the interaction energies according to second-order
perturbation theory (DE
(2)).26 Two oxygen lone pairs of each of
the sulfonate groups (4 lone pairs in total) were overlapping
with the antibonding orbital of the carbonyl group inA12, with
NBO energies of 0.8, 4.3, 0.8 and 4.0 kcal mol
−1 (n /p* (C]O)
in Fig. 2B; see also Table S2†). The sum (9.9 kcal mol−1) was
signicantly higher than the one observed for the sulfonate-
imine n / p* (C]N) interactions (sum = 5.5 kcal mol−1).
These values are in agreement with the aldehydes being better
electron acceptors than their imines. A diﬀerent scenario was
found for theA12B1 iminium cation. This species was mainly
stabilized by a strong hydrogen bonding between the sulfonate
group and the acidic proton of the iminium unit (n /s* (N–H)
= 28.8 kcal mol
−1), together with a weaker H-bond between the
iminium CH and the lone pair of the other ortho-sulfonate
substituent (n / s* (C–H) = (1.3 kcal mol−1)), which also
contributed through a sulfonate-iminium n / p* (C]N)
interaction (2.9 kcal mol−1). Therefore, the lowKim observed for
the sulfonate-containing species at high pD values (pD >
pK
a,iminium) was likely the result of the strongern / p* inter-
actions for the aldehyde than for the imine derivatives that
shied the equilibrium back to the reagents once the iminium
could not be generated.
We envisaged that such bulky and negatively-charged substituents
near the electrophilic site might also aﬀect the kinetic preferences of the
products.40,41The steric hindrance of the carbonyl unit was estimated
using the SambVca web server, which calculates buried volumes and
steric maps (Fig. 3A; see ESI† for details).
42,43 Results suggested
a remarkably sterically-hindered microenvironment for species pre-
senting sulfonate groups in bothortho-positions, namelyA12, A13and
A14, which should experience slower nucleophilic additions. In fact, the
CHO buried volumes for such aldehydes representedca. 27% of the
total space, providinga z9-fold increase in comparison with the value
calculated forA0 (3%, Fig. 3A). In terms of the imine/iminium forma-
tion,1H NMR monitoring over time revealed slower rates for the reac-
tion betweenB1 and A12/A13/A14, needingca. 3ht or e a c ht h e
equilibrium state (Fig. 3B). In contrast, aldehydes with CHO buried
volumes <20% (i.e., PLP, A10, A11, A15) attainted the equilibrium in less
than 10 min, in good accordance with the expected fast imitation
reactions in water.
12
Concerning the aldehyde hydration, the kinetic proles were
too fast to be measured due to the huge excess of H2O present in
the media. Yet, one should note that the presence of strong
electrostatic repulsions between the electron-rich O atom of the
OH
−/H2O and the negatively-charged sulfonate groups may
slow down the generation of the hydrate, but without aﬀecting
the thermodynamic outcome. Electron density surfaces (EDS) of
the aldehydes (A10–15, PLP) and nucleophiles (H
2O, OH−, B1)
were calculated to evaluate this assumption (Fig. 3C). In the
case of the nucleophiles, the electron density of OH− -and to
a lesser degree H2O– was substantially more negative than that
of B1, in line with the number of lone pairs present in the
nucleophilic site (3 for OH−, 2 for H2O and 1 forB1). On the
other hand, the negative electron density surrounding the
aldehydes increased in the order:A10 zPLP < A11 /C28A15 < A12
z A14 < A13.

The imine formation dependence on the protonation state of
the amines was then evaluated for the best-performing alde-
hydes PLP, A14 and A15. Results for A14 revealed a drastic
decrease in K
im upon reaction with amines containing <10%
unprotonated –NH2 groups at pD 7.0 (see orange bars forB3, B4,
Val and B5, Fig. 4).33 For example,A14 did not react withVal and
B5, and imine yields ofca. 10% were attained withB3 and B4
(pKa values of 9.1 and 9.6, respectively; see Fig. S10 and Table
S3†). In contrast, aldehyde A15 gave high imine abundances
even when reacted with amines presenting a pKa value >10 (e.g.,
B5). In a similar manner, PLP was able to react with such
amines despite the high degree of protonation of the–NH2
groups at physiological pH, suggesting that theortho-OH group
must be activating the amines for their nucleophilic attack.44 To
our delight,A15 was able to render higherKim than PLP in all
cases, stressing its remarkable reactivity (Fig. 4). Moreover, the
stability of PLP-derived imines was lower than that ofA15,a s
evidenced by the appearance of side-product signals in the
1H
NMR spectrum ofPLPB1 aer 120 h (Fig. S11 and S12†). The
imitation reactions of A14, A15 and PLP with Lys-derivatives
were also assayed. As predicted, aldehydeA14 was only able to
react with the Na of LysOMe due to its relatively low –NH2
protonation at pD 7.0 (50%, Fig. S13†),13,45 not forming any
imines with the N3 of Lys and LysOMe nor with the Na of Lys
(unprotonated –NH2 < 2%, Table S3; Fig. S14†). On the other
hand, bothPLP and A15 reacted with the Na and N3 of LysOMe
and Lys, with a slightly preferential aldimine formation at the
Na in both cases. The reaction with N3 was further corroborated

using AcNaLysOMe as the nucleophile, observing that onlyPLP
and A15 gave aldimines.
The dynamic character of A15-derived aldimines was also
evaluated with a simple re-arrangement experiment, observing
that when B1 (5 mM nal concentration) was introduced into
a solution containingA15B5 (5 mM mixture ofB5 and A15), B5
was released and A15B1 was formed as the major product
(Fig. S15†). This aldimine interconversion occurred instanta-
neously in the time range of the experiment, stressing the
outstanding reversibility ofA15-derived aldimines under phys-
iological conditions.
All these results paved the way for studying the regulation of
a PLP dependent enzyme (i.e., Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase
from porcine heart, GPT) with aldehyde A15.
46–50 GPT is
catalytically-active in amino acid-D2O exchange reactions in the
presence of pyruvate under slightly basic conditions.51 Thus, we
studied the L-alanine-D2O exchange reaction in an NMR tube
containing L-alanine (90 mM), pyruvate (1.5 mM), potassium
phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, pD 7.8) and 7 units ofGPT (ca. 1
mM). The reaction course was easily followed by 1H NMR
observing the deuterium exchange of botha and b hydrogens of
L-alanine (black points in Fig. 5A; see also Fig. S16†). The
experiment in the absence of GPT showed no reaction (grey
points in Fig. 5A). As expected, the addition of a large excess of
PLP and A14 did not change the catalytic activity ofGPT (red
and orange points in Fig. 5A, respectively), sincePLP is already
present as the cofactor andA14 does not form imines with N3-
Lys (see Fig. S13 †). In contrast, 200 eq. of A15 triggered
a remarkable inhibition of the enzyme (ca. 90%). Although
lower amounts ofA15 led to a less eﬃcient inhibition, the IC50
for this aldehyde was about 15mM( ca. 15 eq). To support that
the inhibition observed was indicative of A15-PLP aldimine
exchange, we studied the amount ofA15 required to replacePLP
from the preformedPLPAcNaLysOMe aldimine under related
experimental conditions (pD 7.8). The presence of 0.7 eq. ofA15
resulted in a signicant PLP replacement (42%), but 4 eq. ofA15
were needed to reach an aldimine exchange >90% (Fig. S17†).
The higher number of equivalents needed to replacePLP by A15
in the active site of GPT was assigned to a supramolecular
mismatch between the para-sulfonate group of A15 and the
carboxylate group of the aspartic acid residue (see Fig. S18† for
the example of an analogous PLP-complex of the Human
alanine aminotransferase 2, PDB: 3IHJ).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have evaluated the hydration and imitation
reactions of diﬀerent aldehydes in aqueous media, comparing
the results with the ones attained in the presence of the
biologically-relevant PLP. Aldehydes A12–A15 resulted in
remarkable K
im with complete silencing of hydrate formation
(Khyd) when reacted with B1, despite the low concentrations
employed. The mode-of-action to attain excellent imine vs.
hydrate selectivities relies on the interplay between: (i) high
Hammett values to increase carbonyl electrophilic character; (ii)
sterically crowding units to disfavour the Csp
2 hybridization of
hydrate and hemiaminals; and (iii) negatively-charged sites to
stabilize the iminium cations through electrostatic, H-bonding
and n / p* interactions. The imine yields for the reaction
between the best-performing aldehydes (i.e., PLP, A14 and A15)
and amines presenting a high –NH
2 protonation were also
evaluated. The results obtained in the presence of A15 sur-
passed the ones of PLP, postulating A15 as the most active
aldehyde in imitation reactions under physiological conditions
reported to date. In addition,A14 can be used for the selective
Na functionalization of peptides since it does not react with the
N3 of Lys-derivatives.
Preliminary studies on the A15 conjugation to a model
protein suggested the suitability of this aldehyde to replacePLP
from the active site through dynamic aldimine exchange,
allowing for the inhibition of the enzymatic activity. All these
