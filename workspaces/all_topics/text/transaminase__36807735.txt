Abstract 
Biobased polymers der
ived from plant oils are sustainable alternatives to petro based polymers. In recent years, multienzyme 
cascades have been developed for the synthesis of biobased ω-aminocarboxylic acids, which serve as building blocks for poly-
amides. In this work, we have developed a novel enzyme cascade for the synthesis of 12-aminododeceneoic acid, a precursor 
for nylon-12, starting from linoleic acid. Seven bacterial ω-transaminases (ω-TAs) were cloned, expressed in Escherichia 
coli and successfully purified by affinity chromatography. Activity towards the oxylipin pathway intermediates hexanal and 
12-oxododecenoic acid in their 9(Z ) and 10(E) isoforms was demonstrated for all seven transaminases in a coupled photo-
metric enzyme assay. The highest specific activities were obtained with ω-TA from Aquitalea denitrificans 
 (T
RAD), with 
0.62 U  mg−1 for 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid, 0.52 U  mg−1 for 12-oxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid and 1.17 U  mg−1 for hexanal. 
A one-pot enzyme cascade was established with  TRAD and papaya hydroperoxide lyase  (HPLCP-N), reaching conversions of 
59% according to LC-ELSD quantification. Starting from linoleic acid, up to 12% conversion to 12-aminododecenoic acid 
was achieved with a 3-enzyme cascade comprising soybean lipoxygenase (LOX-1), 
 HPLCP-N and  TRAD. Higher product 
concentrations were achieved by the consecutive addition of enzymes compared to simultaneous addition at the beginning.
Key points
• Seven ω-transaminases converted 12-oxododecenoic acid into its corresponding amine.
• A three-enzyme cascade with lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase, and ω-transaminase was established for the first time.
• A one-pot transformation of linoleic acid to 12-aminododecenoic acid, a precursor of nylon-12 was achieved.

Introduction
Polyamides are important industrial polymers. Among 
them, nylon-12 exhibits properties that are centered 
between short-chain aliphatic nylons (e.g. nylon-6) and 
high-molecular-weight polymers (e.g., polyethylene). Nylon-
12, as a high-performance polymer with good heat, UV and 
chemical resistance, is manufactured by ring opening polym-
erization of ω-laurolactam (Ladkau et al. 2016). Laurolactam 
is synthesized in a complex reaction cascade starting from the 
trimerization of petro-derived butadiene followed by cyclodo-
decane oxime synthesis and Beckmann rearrangement (Karau 
et al. 2015). An increasing demand exists to replace fossil 
resources with renewable materials, forcing a switch in poly-
mer production. For polyamide precursors, engineered whole-
cell biocatalysts were used for their synthesis from fatty acids 
in multistep enzyme cascades. For example, 11-aminound-
ecanoic acid, a precursor for nylon-11, was obtained from 
12-hydroxystearic acid using alcohol dehydrogenase, Bae-
yer–Villiger monooxygenase, esterase, and ω-transaminase 
(ω-TA) (Song et al. 2014). Furthermore, a whole-cell biocata-
lyst was designed using the alkane monooxygenase AlkBGT 
from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 and the ω-TA CV2025 from

Chromobacterium violaceum for the synthesis of 12-aminodo-
decanoic acid methyl ester from methyl laurate (Schrewe et al. 
2013). The cascade was further improved by implementation 
of an alanine regeneration system to supply sufficient amounts 
of cosubstrate, overexpression of the outer membrane pro-
tein AlkL for substrate uptake and implementation of alcohol 
dehydrogenase AlkJ for increased alcohol oxidation (Ladkau 
et al. 2016; Ge et al. 2020).
A disadvantage of the methyl laurate route towards nylon-
12 is the utilization of tropical oils, which are the only 
source of natural lauric acid in large quantities. In contrast, 
linoleic acid is present in safflower or sunflower oil at high 
concentrations. In this work, we targeted a novel enzyme 
cascade for the synthesis of 12-aminododecenoic acid from 
linoleic acid (Fig. 1). For this purpose, lipoxygenase (LOX) 
and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) originating from the oxylipin 
pathway were coupled to a transaminase reaction. In pre-
vious work from our group, 12-oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid 
and hexanal were obtained from safflower oil in an enzyme 
cascade utilizing lipase, LOX, and HPL (Coenen et al. 
2022). To date, the application of LOX and HPL has mainly 
focused on the green note synthesis of C6- and C9-aldehydes 
and their corresponding alcohols (Gigot et al. 2012; Vincenti 
et al. 2019; Stolterfoht et al. 2019 ). Otte et al. ( 2013) used 
9-specific LOX and HPL for the synthesis of 9-oxonona -
noic acid. The integration of LOX and HPL into an E. coli  
host enabled the synthesis of the corresponding bifunctional 
azelaic acid employing endogenous oxidoreductases. The 
application of this intermediate as a polyester or polyamide 
building block was proposed (Otte et al. 2014).
ω-TA from C . violaceum has previously been shown 
to accept 12-oxododecanoic acid as a substrate (Schrewe 
et al. 2013), but the corresponding unsaturated 12-oxo-
9(Z)-dodecenoic acid has not yet been tested as a ω-TA 
substrate. Therefore, we analyzed seven ω-TAs for their 
potential to synthesize 12-amino-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid. 
In addition to ω-TA from C. violaceum 
 (TRCV) (Kaul-
mann et al. 2007), we chose enzymes from Paracoc-
cus denitrificans 
 (TRPD) (Rausch et al. 2013), and from 
uncultured bacteria most likely assigned to Acidihalobac-
ter genus 
 (TR2) and Rhodobacteraceae family  (TR3 and 
 TR6) (Coscolín et al. 2019). Additionally, new ω-TAs from 
Aquitalea denitrificans  (TRAD) and Sulfitobacter delicatus  
 (TRSD) were selected based on sequence homology analy -
sis. The best-performing ω-TA was coupled in a one-pot 
reaction with lipoxygenase LOX-1 from Glycine max and

Materials and methods
Reagents
The 12-aminododecanoic acid standard was purchased 
from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA, USA), while the 12-oxo-
9(Z)-dodecenoic acid and 12-oxo-10(E )-dodecenoic acid 
standards were purchased from Larodan (Solna, Sweden). 
Pyridoxal-5-phosphate monohydrate (PLP) was obtained 
from Acros Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, 
MA, USA). Hexanal, hexylamine, soybean LOX-1, and 
L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were supplied from Sigma 
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Linoleic acid was obtained 
from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 
β-Nicotine amide adenine dinucleotide disodium salt 
(NADH), isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 
l-alanine, imidazole, ampicillin sodium salt, and kanamy -
cin sulfate were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Ger-
many). 13S-Hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid 
(13S-HPODE) was prepared from linoleic acid by a peroxi-
dation reaction with LOX-1 from Glycine max as described 
previously (Gala Marti et al. 2021). All other chemicals were 
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Thermo Fisher 
Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) or Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, 
Germany).
Bioinformatic analysis
Putative novel transaminases homologous to ω-TA 
from C. violaceum CV2025 
 (TRCV: accession number 
WP_011135573.1) were identified with the Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al. 1990 ). 
We selected two new transaminases from A.  denitrificans  
 (TRAD: WP_159877958.1) and S. delicatus  (TRSD; acces-
sion number WP_093738538.1) and compared them to the 
previously described transaminases from P.  denitrificans  
 (TRPD: accession number ABL72050.1), Acidihalobac-
ter sp. 
 (TR2: accession number MH588437), and uncul-
tured Rhodobacteraceae bacteria 
 (TR3: accession number 
MF158202 and 
 TR6: accession number MF158205). A 
multiple sequence alignment of ω-TAs was performed with 
Clustal Omega (Sievers et al. 2011). A phylogenetic tree 
was constructed based on the neighbor-joining algorithm 
with a bootstrap value of 1000 and was generated with 
ClustalX (Thompson et al. 1997) and NJPlot (Perrière and 
Gouy 1996).
Cloning and expression of enzymes
The sequences coding for the transaminases  TRAD,  TRCV, 
 TRPD, and  TRSD were codon-optimized by BioCat GmbH 
(Heidelberg, Germany) for synthesis in E. coli. The opti-
mized sequences tr
AD (accession number: OP866794), trCV 
(accession number: OP866795), tr PD (accession number: 
OP866796), and tr SD (accession number: OP866797) were 
cloned into the pET-21b(
 +) v
ector (Table  1). A sequence 
coding for a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6) was added 
for affinity purification. Chemically-competent E. coli  
BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the respective vec-
tors by heat shock at 42 °C for 90 s according to Hana -
han (1983) and protein expression was carried out. Shak -
ing flasks with baffles were inoculated with 2% (v/v) of an 
overnight culture, and cells were grown in terrific broth (TB) 
containing 100 µg 
 ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C until the  OD600 
reached 0.7–1. Then, cell expression was induced with 1 mM 
IPTG, and the temperature was lowered to 20 °C. Cells were 
cultured for 24 h before they were harvested by centrifuga-
tion at 4500
 ×
 g f
or 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was 
discarded, and the cell pellets were frozen at
 −
 20 
°C until 
further use.
The transaminases 
 TR2,  TR3, and  TR6, which were cloned 
into pRhokHi-2 (for 
 TR2) and pBXCH (for  TR3 and  TR6), 
were expressed in E. coli MC1061 as described previously 
(Coscolín et al. 2019). Hydroperoxide lyase from C. papaya 
 (HPLCP-N) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the 
pET-28a(
 +) e
xpression vector as described previously 
(Coenen et al. 2022).
Protein purification
All transaminases were C-terminally His6-tagged and puri-
fied by metal affinity chromatography. For purification of 
 TRAD,  TRCV,  TRPD, and  TRSD, cell pellets from a 50-ml cul-
ture were suspended in 10 ml 50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl and 40 mM imida-
zole. The suspensions were incubated on ice for 1 h before the 
cells were sonicated seven times for 15 s to obtain the crude 
extract (CE). The soluble fraction (SF) was separated after 
centrifugation of the CE for 45 min at 21,000
 ×
 g at 4 
°C and 
loaded onto a HisTrap™ FF column (Cytiva, Marlborough, 
MA, USA). Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by 
washing with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 with 
500 mM NaCl and 40 mM imidazole, and the enzyme was 
eluted with 250 mM imidazole. The buffer was exchanged 
to 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5 with 50 mM NaCl 
using a HiTrap® Desalting column (Cytiva, Marlborough, 
MA, USA). The eluted protein fractions were concentrated 
with Pierce™ Protein Concentrators PES, 10 K MWCO 
from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The 
His6-tagged transaminases 
 TR2,  TR3, and  TR6 were purified

by affinity chromatography as described by Coscolín et al. 
(2019), and  H
PLCP-N was purified as described by Coenen 
et al. ( 2022). Protein concentrations were measured with 
Bradford reagent (Bradford 1976), and the purification pro-
cess was monitored with sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryla-
mide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Laemmli 1970).
Preparation of 12‑oxododecenoic acid
12-Oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid was obtained from 13S-HPODE 
by a hydroperoxide lyase reaction using 
 HPLCP-N. Reaction mix-
tures were prepared with 5 mM 13S-HPODE and 20 U  ml−1 
 HPLCP-N in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6 with 1 M 
NaCl for 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction products (12-oxo-9(Z)-
dodecenoic acid and hexanal) were extracted by solvent extrac-
tion with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Due to the different 
volatilities of the substances, the solvent and hexanal could be 
evaporated with a vacuum concentrator, while 12-oxo-9(Z)-
dodecenoic acid remained in the reaction vial. 12-Oxo-9(Z)-
dodecenoic acid was dissolved in ethanol and frozen at
 −
 80 
°C 
until further use. The amount and purity of 12-oxo-9(Z)-dode-
cenoic acid were confirmed by GC analysis as described previ-
ously (Coenen et al. 2022). The remaining hexanal concentration 
was less than 1.5% compared to 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid.
Transaminase activity assay
Transaminase activity was measured in triplicate in a cou-
pled photometric enzyme assay with lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) and NADH in a volume of 1 ml. Reactions were car-
ried out in a cuvette containing 10 µl ω-TA solution, 10 µl of 
a 50 U 
 ml−1 LDH solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
USA), 0.1 mM substrate, 10 mM l-alanine and 0.1 mM pyr-
idoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) in 50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer pH 7.5 with 50 mM NaCl. 12-Oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic 
acid, 12-oxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid, or hexanal were used 
as substrates. Reactions were started by the addition of 
NADH to a concentration of 0.1 mM, and the decrease in 
absorbance was measured at 340 nm for 300 s at 22 °C. The 
extinction coefficient of NADH of 6220 
 M−1  cm−1 was used 
to determine the volumetric activity, and specific activities 
were calculated with Microsoft Excel based on the protein 
concentrations of the purified ω-TAs. Reactions without sub-
strate addition were set up as negative control to confirm 
the assay. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that 
catalyzes the amination of 1 µmol of substrate (12-oxo-9(Z)-
dodecenoic acid, 12-oxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid, or hexanal) 
per minute with alanine as amine donor. The formation of 
NADH is proportional to the transformation of the acceptor 
substrates as outlined in Fig. 1.

Activity monitoring of the LOX, HPL, and ω‑TA 
enzyme cascade
The product conversion in a one-pot reaction with  HPLCP-N 
and ω-TA was analyzed photometrically as described above 
(paragraph 2.6). Additionally, 10 µl of a 20 U  ml−1  HPLCP-N 
solution was added to the cuvette, and 0.1 mM 13S-HPODE 
was used as substrate. Reactions were started by the addition 
of NADH, and the decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 
340 nm was monitored. Negative controls were performed by 
omitting the enzymes one by one to exclude a side reaction.
For a one-pot reaction with LOX-1, 
 HPLCP-N, and ω-TA, 
the reaction mixtures were prepared in the same way. Addi-
tionally, 10 µl of 50 U  ml−1 LOX-1 was added to the cuvette, 
and 0.1 mM linoleic acid was used as substrate. Again, reac-
tions were started by the addition of NADH, and negative 
controls were performed by omitting the enzymes one by one.
Biocatalytic synthesis of 12‑aminododecenoic acid 
and hexylamine
Transaminase reactions of 500 µl were set up with 5 U  ml−1 
of purified ω-TA (unit activity based on coupled photo-
metric assay with 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid substrate), 
50 mM l-alanine and 0.1 mM pyridoxal-5-phosphate in 
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 
50 mM NaCl. Optionally, DMSO was added at concentra-
tions from 5 to 20%. Reactions were started by the addition 
of either 2.5 mM 12-oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid, 12-oxo-
10(E)-dodecenoic acid or hexanal. Reactions were typically 
carried out at 22 °C for 1 to 5 h. Then, 900 µl of a 50:50 
acetonitrile–water mixture was added to 100 µl of reaction 
solution to stop the reaction, and the mixtures were used for 
HPLC analysis.
One-pot reactions with 20 U 
 ml−1  HPLCP-N and 5 U  ml−1 
 T
RAD were carried out in a volume of 500 µl. Reactions 
were run at 22 °C using 50 mM l-alanine, 0.1 mM pyridoxal-
5-phosphate, and 1 mM or 2.5 mM 13S-HPODE as substrate 
in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 
500 mM NaCl. The enzyme reactions were conducted either 
simultaneously for 1 h or consecutively, with 
 HPLCP-N added 
at the beginning and incubated for 5 min before 
 TRAD was 
added for 1 h. In a third approach, 
 TRAD was added in the 
beginning and 
 HPLCP-N was added consecutively every 
10 min for 1 h.
In addition, one-pot reactions with LOX-1,  H
PLCP-N, and 
 TRAD were conducted with 100 U   ml−1 LOX-1, 20 U  ml−1 
 HPLCP-N, and 5 U   ml−1  TRAD in a total volume of 500 µl. 
The reactions were carried out as described above with 
1 mM or 2.5 mM linoleic acid as substrate. Three differ -
ent reaction settings were tested. Either all enzymes were 
added in the beginning and incubated for 4 h or LOX-1 was 
preincubated with linoleic acid for 3 h before 
 HPLCP-N was 
added. After 5 min, 
 T
RAD was added together with l-alanine 
and pyridoxal-5-phosphate and reacted for another hour. In a 
third approach, LOX-1 was preincubated with linoleic acid 
for 3 h before 
 TRAD was added to l-alanine and pyridoxal-
5-phosphate, and 
 H
PLCP-N was added in portions every 
10 min over a period of 1 h.
Analysis of products by liquid chromatography
Mass spectrometry data were obtained using an LC-30AD 
Nexera LC/MS system from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) 
equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-M20A UV detector and Shi-
madzu LCMS-2020 mass spectrometry detector. Samples of 
5 to 10 µl were loaded onto a Kromasil Orbit-100-C18 5 μm 
column (30 mm
 ×
 4.6 
mm). Water (A) and acetonitrile (B) 
containing 0.1% formic acid were used as the mobile phase. 
A linear gradient was applied as follows: 0.1 min 20% B; 
20% B to 90% B within 4 min; 1.1 min holding at 90% B. 
A flow rate of 1.0 ml 
 m
in−1 was used. Samples were ion-
ized by electron spray ionization (ESI) in negative and posi-
tive modes and recorded in the range of 50 to 700 m/z. For 
reference spectra, the standards 12-aminododecanoic acid, 
12-oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid, 12-oxo-10(E )-dodecenoic 
acid, hexanal, and hexylamine were used.
Quantification of 12-aminododecenoic acid was con-
ducted using an LC-20AD XR Nexera Liquid Chroma-
tograph from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an 
evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) 100 (VWR, 
Radnor, PA, USA). Samples of 10 to 20 µl were loaded onto 
a LaChrom II
 +
 C18 RP column (250 
mm
 ×
 4.6 
mm, 5 µm 
particle size) from Hitachi (Chiyoda, Japan). As the mobile 
phase, water (A) and acetonitrile (B) containing 0.1% for -
mic acid were used. A linear gradient was applied as fol-
lows: 20% B to 60% B within 14 min; 60% B to 80% B 
within 3 min; 80% B to 90% B within 5 min. A flow rate of 
1.0 ml 
 min−1 was used. Since 12-aminododecenoic acid is 
not commercially available, 12-aminododecanoic acid (Alfa 
Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA) was used for calibration.
Results
Cloning and expression of ω‑transaminases
ω-Transaminases (ω-TAs) have been successfully used for 
the amination of hydrophobic aldehydes including the syn-
thesis of 12-aminododecanoic acid from the correspond-
ing 12-oxododecanoic acid (Schrewe et al. 2013; Song 
et al. 2014). The structurally similar monounsaturated 
12-oxododecenoic acid in its 9(Z )- or 10(E )-conformation 
can be obtained from linoleic acid by biocatalytic synthe-

oxododecenoic acids can be used as substrates by ω-TAs, 
seven enzyme candidates were evaluated. As a starting point, 
we selected the transaminase from C. violaceum 
 (TRCV) 
with proven activity towards 12-oxododecanoic acid. In 
addition, we chose the transaminase from P. denitrificans  
 (TRPD) with a sequence identity of 38.31% to the C. vio-
laceum enzyme (Table S1). This enzyme was reported to 
transform 6-oxohexanoic acid to the corresponding 6-ami-
nohexanoic acid (Sattler et al. 2014). The transaminases 
 TR2 from Acidihalobacter sp. as well as  TR3 and  TR6 from 
uncultured Rhodobacteraceae bacteria have been shown to 
convert bulky ketones and hexanal (Coscolín et al. 2019) 
and were also included in the enzyme screening. They share 
sequence identities of 58.94%, 34.54%, and 54.75%, respec-
tively, to 
 TRCV. In addition, a BLAST search was performed 
to identify additional homologues of 
 TRCV. Transaminases 
from A. denitrificans  (TRAD) and S. delicatus  (TRSD) were 
selected with identities of 81.05% and 53.64% with respect 
to 
 TRCV (Table S1).
Gene sequences encoding 
 TRCV,  TRAD,  TRPD, and  TRSD 
were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and syn-
thesized by BioCat GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). They 
were cloned into the pET-21(b)
 +
 e
xpression vector, and E 
coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the respective vec-
tors. The recombinant strains were grown in TB medium 
containing ampicillin at 20 °C for 24 h. Overexpression of 
the transaminases was analyzed with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2a). 
Strong protein bands representing 
 TRCV,  TRAD,  TRPD, and 
 TRSD were visible in both the crude extracts (CE) and, after 
separation of cell fragments, in the soluble fractions (SF). 
All transaminases were His6-labelled and successfully puri-
fied by metal affinity chromatography (Fig.  2b). Proteins 
were eluted, and minor impurities were observed only in 
the 
 TRPD and  TRSD fractions. Overexpression of  TRCV and 
 TRAD resulted in total yields of 41 mg for  TRAD and 80 mg 
for  TRCV were obtained from 50 ml of culture broth. For 
 TRPD and  TRSD, the yields were lower; nevertheless, 13 and 
17 mg of purified enzymes were obtained from 50 ml cul-
ture. Transaminases 
 TR2,  TR3, and  TR6 were expressed in E. 
coli MC1061 as described previously (Coscolín et al. 2019). 
The protein masses of 45–55 kDa observed in SDS‒PAGE 
corresponded well with the calculated masses of the His6-
tagged ω-TAs, which ranged from 48.42 to 51.25 kDa. The 
highest protein concentrations were measured in the eluate 
fractions of 
 TRCV at 13.9 mg   ml−1, followed by  TR3 and 
 TRAD at 5.21 mg  ml−1 and 5.14 mg  ml−1, respectively.
Functional expression of the ω-TAs was analyzed with 
hexanal as a reference substrate (Fig.  2c). For this pur -
pose, a coupled enzymatic activity assay was established 
with l-alanine, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH (Fig.  1). 
The specific transaminase activities were calculated from 
the initial decrease in NADH. Negative controls in which 
enzymes, substrate or cofactor were sequentially omitted 
showed only minor background reactions, thus confirming

the functionality of the enzyme assay. Figure 2c shows that 
all enzymes were functionally expressed and accepted hexa-
nal as a substrate, with 
 TRAD exhibiting the highest specific 
activity with 1.17 U  mg−1, followed by  TR6 and  TRSD.
Transaminase activity analysis in a coupled enzyme 
system
12-Oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid and 12-oxo-10(E)-dodecenoic 
acid were tested as ω-TA substrates in the coupled photo-
metric assay. All seven enzymes accepted both oxoacids, 
revealing a broad substrate spectrum of the ω-TAs (Fig. 3a). 
In general, the shorter-chain aldehyde hexanal (Fig. 2c) was 
the best substrate for the ω-TAs except for 
 TRPD, which 
exhibited higher specific activity for 12-oxo-9( Z)-dode-
cenoic acid. 
 TRAD showed the highest specific activities, 
with 0.62 U   mg−1 for 12-oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid and 
0.52 U  mg−1 for 12-oxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid. Although 
the double bonds are in direct proximity to the oxo-group, 
their position does not seem to affect their acceptance as 
transaminase substrates. Remarkably, five of the seven 
transaminases transformed the 10(E)- and 9(Z)-isomers with 
comparable activity. Especially in the 10(E )-configuration, 
a stabilized double bond system is formed in conjugation 
with the oxo-group, which should be a demanding substrate 
for transaminases. However, only 
 TRPD and  TR6 exhibited 
significantly lower activities towards the 10(E) isomer.
Coupling of transaminases with enzymes from the 
oxylipin pathway reveals a route for the synthesis of pol-
yamide precursors from linoleic acid. To elucidate the 
feasibility of this pathway, we first combined ω-TAs with 
 HPLCP-N and monitored the NADH decrease in the LDH 
coupled photometric assay. The initial overall activity could 
be monitored as the sole parameter because hexanal and oxo-
dodecenoic acid are measured simultaneously. 13S-HPODE, 
which was synthesized with LOX-1 as described previously 
(Gala Marti et al. 2021), was used as substrate, and purified 
papaya 
 HPLCP-N expressed in E. coli (Coenen et al. 2022) 
was applied in the enzyme assay. Enzymatic activity was 
demonstrated for all seven ω-TAs (Fig.  3b). The highest 
conversion rates of 31.6 nmol 
 m
in−1  m l −1 were obtained 
with  TRCV, followed by  TRAD and  TR2.  TRAD and  TRCV 
already showed relatively high specific activities in the sin-
gle substrate measurements (Fig.  3a), whereas 
 TR2 exhib-
ited relatively low specific activities. In contrast, 
 TRSD per-
formed better in the single-substrate measurements than in 
the enzyme cascade with 
 HPLCP-N. Transaminase deactiva-
tion by the reactive hydroperoxide substrate 13S-HPODE or 
differences in transaminase substrate affinities may explain 
these differences.
Next, one-pot enzyme reactions were performed using 
soybean LOX-1, 
 HPLCP-N and ω-TAs with linoleic acid 
as the substrate. Again, coupling to LDH and monitoring 
of NADH decrease was used for analysis of initial activi-
ties. A positive reaction was confirmed with all transami-
nases, although the overall activity was lower than that in 
the HPL–ω-TA system (Fig.  3b). The highest activity of 
5.6 nmol 
 min−1  ml−1 was measured with  TRAD, followed by 
 TRCV and  TR2 exhibiting 4.9 nmol  min−1  m l −1 each.
Development of an enzyme cascade 
with transaminase TRAD
TRAD was selected for the further development of a cou-
pled enzyme cascade with oxylipin pathway enzymes. To 
monitor the synthesis of 12-aminododecenoic acid and 
hexylamine individually, the establishment of an analytical 
method was needed. For the detection of amino dodecenoic 
acids, we developed an LC-based analysis using ELSD 
detection (Fig.  4). Quantification of 12-aminododecenoic

acid was possible using commercially available 12-ami-
nododecanoic acid as a reference standard for the ELSD 
detector (Figure S1a). The formation of 12-aminododece-
noic acid with 
 TRAD was monitored over a period of 5 h. 
A maximum conversion of 47% was obtained at a substrate 
concentration of 2.5 mM within 1 h (Fig.  4). Hence, a 
1-h reaction time was chosen for the development of the 
enzyme cascade.
For product verification, LC was coupled with a mass 
spectrometer. The mass spectrum of 12-aminododecenoic 
acid reveals a major peak at 214 m/z, which correlates to 
the molecular weight of its protonated form (Fig. S1b). 
Comparative analysis of 12-aminododecanoic acid pos-
sessing two extra hydrogen atoms gave a mass spectrum 
with a major peak at 216 m/z (Figure S1c). Transamination 
of 12-oxo-9(Z )- and 12-oxo-10(E )-dodecenoic acid (Fig-
ure S2a) resulted in similar mass spectra with the same 
peak at 214 m/z in each case (Figure S1d). The transforma-
tion of hexanal to hexylamine was monitored accordingly, 
and the mass spectrum of the 
 T
RAD reaction product cor -
related with the mass spectrum of a hexylamine reference 
exhibiting a peak of 102 m/z for the protonated molecule 
(Figure S2 b, c).
TR
AD exhibited a pH optimum of 7.5 with remaining 
activities of approximately 40% at pH 6 and 20% at pH 9 
(Fig.  5a). While LOX-1 has its pH optimum at approxi-
mately pH 9, 
 HPLCP-N performs best at pH 6 (Coenen et al. 
2022). Since our previous study showed sufficient activity 
of LOX-1 and 
 HPLCP-N in a one-pot reaction at pH 7.5, 
this pH was expected to be suited for the three-enzyme 
cascade. The optimum NaCl concentration of 
 TRAD was 
50 mM, and more than 60% activity was maintained at 
high salt concentrations of 500 mM (Fig.  5b). 
 HPLCP-N 
requires high salt concentrations for optimal activ -
ity (Coenen et al. 2022 ); therefore, a salt concentration 
of 500 mM NaCl was chosen for the enzyme cascade. 
LOX-1 and 
 HPLCP-N are temperature-sensitive enzymes, 
and thus, a low reaction temperature should be applied in 
the enzyme cascade reaction. The highest 12-aminodo-
decenoic acid conversion by 
 TRAD was achieved at room 
temperature (22 °C) (Fig.  5c) and was chosen for all fur -
ther experiments. It has been reported that transaminases, 
including 
 TR2,  TR3, and  TR6, exhibit higher activities in 
the presence of DMSO (Coscolín et al. 2019). In contrast, 
we did not observe an activating effect of DMSO on 
 TRAD 
(Fig. 5d); thus, the enzyme cascade was established under 
solvent-free conditions.
During the development of an enzyme cascade for the 
transformation of safflower oil to oxododecenoic acid, 
we discovered that the consecutive addition of enzymes 
resulted in better substrate conversion (Coenen et al. 2022). 
Therefore, simultaneous and consecutive enzyme addition 
was tested to determine the best conditions for a coupled 
 HPLCP-N–TRAD reaction. Two modes of consecutive enzyme 
additions were analyzed. Either 
 HPLCP-N was incubated with 
13S-HPODE as substrate for 5 min before 
 TRAD was added 
or  TRAD was added at the beginning of the reaction, and 
 HPLCP-N was dosed in 6 portions and added every 10 min 
for 1 h. The highest 12-aminododecenoic acid conversion 
of 59% was obtained with stepwise HPL addition at a sub-
strate concentration of 1 mM (Fig.  6a). This setup prevents 
a too-rapid synthesis of 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid, which 
is unstable in the presence of high protein concentrations 
(Coenen et al. 2022). Thus, if 12-oxo-9(Z)-dodecenoic acid 
is formed stepwise, 
 TRAD has enough time for the conver -
sion to 12-aminododecenoic acid before 12-oxo-9(Z)-dode-
cenoic acid degradation. The conversion of 13S -HPODE 
with stepwise HPL addition was comparable to the reaction 
of 12-oxododecenoic acid at a substrate concentration of 
2.5 mM with 
 TRAD alone. Hence, this two-enzyme system 
performs equally well.
The three-enzyme cascade with LOX-1, 
 HPLCP-N, and 
 TRAD was analyzed in a similar way with both simultane-
ous and consecutive enzyme addition of HPL and ω-TA. 
According to the results of Gala Marti et al. (2021), the 
LOX-1 reaction proceeds over a period of 3–5 h under 
the chosen reaction conditions. Therefore, reactions 
were started with a 3-h preincubation with LOX-1 and 
linoleic acid as substrates. Then, 
 HPLCP-N was applied 
5 min before 
 TRAD addition or  TRAD was added first, and 
 HPLCP-N was dosed in portions every 10 min for 1 h. The 
highest conversion of 12-aminododecenoic acid was again 
obtained in the reaction setup with stepwise HPL addi-
tion. The maximum conversion was lower than that in the 
2-enzyme system and reached 12%; however, the general 
feasibility of a three-enzyme cascade with LOX-1, HPL 
and ω-TA was demonstrated (Fig.  6b).

Discussion
The vast majority of polymer production still relies on petro-
leum-based naphtha as a raw material. In recent years, several 
approaches have been developed for the synthesis of biologi-
cally based polymer precursors (Chung et al. 2015). 12-Ami-
nododecanoic acid, the monomer for nylon-12 production, was 
synthesized from vegetable oil based raw materials with an 
engineered E. coli biocatalyst (Schrewe et al. 2013; Ladkau 
et al. 2016). However, this biocatalytic route uses lauric acid as 
the starting material, which can only be obtained in large quan-
tities from palm kernel and coconut oil. Both coconut and oil 
palms can grow in wet tropical climates only, and an increase 
in oil production will increase pressure on pristine rainforests, 
leading to ecological problems (Dislich et al. 2017; Qaim et al. 
2020). To circumvent this issue, we developed an alternative 
enzymatic route towards nylon-12 monomers, which uses lin-
oleic acid as the starting material. Linoleic acid-rich oils are 
available from safflower and sunflower, and large-scale planta-
tions are found in temperate and subtropical climate zones.
The ω-transaminases analyzed in our study originated 
from three different bacterial families: the Rhodobacte-
raceae family comprising 
 TRPD,  TRSD,  TR3, and  TR6, the 
Chromobacteriaceae family comprising 
 TRCV and  TRAD, 
and the Ectothiorhodospiraceae family comprising 
 TR2. 
Differences between P.  denitrificans and C.  violaceum  
ω-TA become visible when analyzing the available crys-
tal structures (Humble et al. 2012; Rausch et al. 2013). 
Interestingly, three residues in the active sites of the sub-
strate pockets differ. While 
 TRCV harbors residues M56, 
M166, and C418, 
 TRPD harbors N53, K163, and L417 in 
the corresponding positions. These changes have been 
described to result in larger and more hydrophobic active 
sites in 
 T
RCV, which could lead, for example, in higher 
activity towards large, hydrophobic compounds such as 
long-chain aliphatic substrates (Rausch et al. 2013). In 
total, 17 amino acids were identified and designated to be 
important for substrate binding: four inside the S- (small) 
pocket and 12 inside the L- (large) pocket. Additionally, 
K285 (numeration of 
 T
RPD) was shown to bind the cofac -
tor PLP.  TRAD is the only transaminase that shares all 17 
amino acid residues with 
 TRCV (Figure S3), suggesting a 
similar structure of the substrate pockets. In contrast, the 
other ω-TAs share only 14 
 (TRSD,  TR2, and  TR6,  TRPD) or 
10  (
TR3) of these amino acids, potentially leading to some 
structural variations. In accordance, phylogenetic analy -
sis revealed that 
 TRAD is most closely related to  TRCV, 
whereas  TRSD,  TR2, and  TR6 are significantly more dis-
tant, with sequence identities of approximately 55% (Fig-
ure S4, Table S1). 
 TRPD and  TR3 are the least homologous 
transaminases, with sequence identities of approximately 
35% to 
 TRCV and only 32% between each other.
Interestingly, despite differences in the sequences and 
amino acid architecture of their substrate pockets, all 
ω-TAs accepted unsaturated long-chain oxoacids as sub-
strates. A clear substrate preference could not be deduced 
from the comparison of the three substrates tested. Most 
ω-TAs preferred hexanal, indicating that unsaturated 
oxoacids are more structurally challenging transaminase 
substrates. The only exception was 
 TRPD, which showed 
higher specific activity for 12-oxo-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid 
than for hexanal. Additionally, the enzyme had a signifi-
cantly lower activity with the 10(E ) isomer, whereas the 
other transaminases showed less differentiation between 
the two isomers. In the coupled enzyme assay with 
 HPLCP-N, a clearer distinction between the ω-TA groups 
was possible. Here, 
 TRCV and  TRAD showed the high-
est initial activities. Hexanal and ω-oxododecenoic acid 
are formed in situ by 
 HPLCP-N, and thus, their substrate 
concentration is initially low. Therefore, 
 TRCV and  TRAD 
must possess higher substrate affinities than the other 
transaminases. The more hydrophobic active sites of these 
two transaminases may allow better substrate binding, 
making these enzymes better suited for the development 
of an enzyme cascade.
Coupling 
 TRAD with  HPLCP-N resulted in a similar sub-
strate conversion as using  T
RAD alone. Thus, at substrate 
concentrations of 2.5 mM, the functionality of the two-
enzyme cascade was proven. However, the three-enzyme 
cascade with LOX-1 resulted in a much lower conversion. 
In our previous study, we showed that the HPL reaction is 
significantly faster than the LOX reaction (Coenen et al. 
2022). Hence, the slow formation of 13S -HPODE could 
be the cause of the lower overall activity observed in the 
coupled three-enzyme system. To circumvent this prob-
lem, reaction setups were tested, in which LOX-1 and 
linoleic acid were preincubated for 3 h before 
 TRAD was 
added, and 
 HPLCP-N was added in portions over an hour. 
Indeed, this reaction setup gave higher product concen-
trations than the simultaneous enzyme addition. Never -
theless, product concentrations of 12% and 3.5% at sub-
strate concentrations of 1 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively, 
demand further reaction optimization. Low yields in a 
coupled LOX and HPL system have also been observed 
previously for the synthesis of 9-oxononanoic acid (Otte 
et al. 2013). Here, yields decreased significantly with 
increasing substrate concentration, and in accordance 
with our findings, the product conversion was signifi-
cantly higher when LOX was preincubated with the sub-
strate prior to the addition of HPL.
Another issue in the development of a LOX–HPL–ω-TA 
enzyme cascade is the low stability of 12-oxo-9(Z )-dode-
cenoic acid. Rapid isomerization to 12-oxo-10(E )-dode-
cenoic acid was observed within few minutes and was 
2218 Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:2209–2221

presumed to be caused either by keto-enol tautomerism 
or by Schiff base formation in the presence of high protein 
concentrations (Coenen et al. 2022). The development of 
a whole-cell biocatalyst for the continuous production of 
12-aminododecenoic acid may overcome the aforemen-
tioned problems by adjusting the respective enzyme activi-
ties. Whole-cell biocatalysts have already been established 
with LOX and HPL (Buchhaupt et al. 2012; Otte et al. 
2014); hence, incorporation of ω-TA should be feasible. 
In addition, a regeneration system for l-alanine and PLP 
could be engineered, which may be important for the con-
version of higher substrate concentrations. In particular, 
an imbalance in alanine–pyruvate concentration can lead 
to an undesired shift of ω-TA-catalyzed alanine forma-
tion. Ge et al. (2020) established a whole-cell biocata-
lyst for the synthesis of 12-aminododecanoic acid from 
dodecanoic acid by enzymatic ω-hydroxylation, oxida-
tion, and ω-amination in combination with a regenera-
tion system for the cosubstrate l-alanine and the cofactors 
NADPH, NADH, and PLP and achieved a yield of 96.5% 
at a concentration of 5 mM. For cofactor regeneration, the 
endogenous cell pathways were used in combination with 
exogenous ribose 5-phosphate (R5P)-dependent PLP syn-
thesis. A similar enzyme cascade with ω-TA and cofactor 
regeneration was developed by Kim et al. (2020), yielding 
up to 77.3% 11-aminoundecanoic acid from ricinoleic acid 
at substrate concentrations of 300 mM. These experiments 
indicate that an engineered whole-cell biocatalyst with a 
cofactor regeneration system may be suitable for a coupled 
LOX–HPL–ω-TA enzyme cascade.
It has to be mentioned that polymerization of our reac-
tion product 12-amino-9(Z )-dodecenoic acid will result in 
unsaturated polyamide 12. Unsaturated polyamides were 
reported more than 80 years ago and the double bond is 
useful for polymer crosslinking (Pryde 1979). Several 
biobased unsaturated polyamides have been described more 
recently and were proposed for example as thermoreactive 
sealants (Radzik et al. 2020). To obtain saturated polyam-
ide 12 hydrogenation of the double bond is needed. Stand-
ard chemical methods like hydrogenation with molecular 
hydrogen using palladium on coal catalysts may be applied 
(Mudiyanselage et al. 2014). Alternatively, ene-reductases 
may be an interesting biocatalytic option for double bond 
hydrogenation especially for the design of a whole cell bio-
catalyst. Ene-reductases exhibit broad substrate spectra and 
are currently applied for the asymmetric reduction of C–C 
double bonds (Toogood and Scrutton 2018).
In summary, seven ω-TAs were successfully cloned, 
expressed and purified, and their activity towards long-
chain aldehydes was verified. 
 TRAD from A. denitrificans  
was selected for the development of a three-enzyme cas-
cade with soybean LOX-1 and papaya 
 HPLCP-N. Starting 
from safflower oil-based linoleic acid, the synthesis of 
12-aminododecenoic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of
