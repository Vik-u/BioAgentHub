ABSTRACT
Most bacteria and archaea possess multiple antivi-
ral defence systems that protect against infection
by phages, archaeal viruses and mobile genetic el-
ements. Our understanding of the diversity of de-
fence systems has increased greatly in the last few
years, and many more systems likely await discov-
ery. To identify defence-related genes, we recently
developed the Prokaryotic Antiviral Defence LOCator
(PADLOC) bioinformatics tool. To increase the acces-
sibility of PADLOC, we describe here the PADLOC
web server (freely available athttps://padloc.otago.
ac.nz), allowing users to analyse whole genomes,
metagenomic contigs, plasmids, phages and ar-
chaeal viruses. The web server includes a more than
5-fold increase in defence system types detected
(since the ﬁrst release) and expanded functional-
ity enabling detection of CRISPR arrays and retron
ncRNAs. Here, we provide user information such as
input options, description of the multiple outputs,
limitations and considerations for interpretation of
the results, and guidance for subsequent analyses.
The PADLOC web server also houses a precomputed
database of the defence systems in>230,000 RefSeq
genomes. These data reveal two taxa, Campylobac-
terota and Spriochaetota, with unusual defence sys-
tem diversity and abundance. Overall, the PADLOC
web server provides a convenient and accessible re-
source for the detection of antiviral defence systems.
GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION
Diverse antiviral defence systems have evolved in bacteria
and archaea that defend against infection by their viruses
and mobile genetic elements. There are over 60 known
broad families of defence systems, with more than 20 dis-
tinct system types discovered in the past five years (precise
talliesaredifficultsinceclassificationschemes,suchasclass,
type and subtype, vary between families of systems and the
mechanisms of many systems remain unknown) (1–5). As
such, system discovery has greatly outpaced the develop-
ment of tools that make use of these new insights. To pro-
vide widespread accessibility to known and newly discov-
ered system types, and ensure consistency between system
annotations, we recently developed the Prokaryotic Antivi-
ralDefenceLocator(PADLOC)toolasaframeworktosys-

results – currently for more than 230,000 bacterial and ar-
chaeal genomes.
Details regarding operation and benchmarking of the
PADLOC tool itself have been described elsewhere (6).
However, there are some important aspects of system de-
tection that users of the PADLOC web server should un-

system proteins are identified by searching their protein se-
quences with a curated database of profile Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs), currently representing> 700 families of
defence-related proteins. Many of the protein families are
representedbymultipleHMMs(forexample,therearecur-
rently 45 HMMs from various sources representing differ-
ent Cas10 clades). Potential matches are filtered to remove
low-scoring hits (based on E-value and coverage thresh-

approach to multi-gene system identification has been ap-

added PADLOC functionality, the addition of many new
systems to the database, limitations and important consid-
erations for interpretation of the results, and guidance for
subsequent analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expansion of the PADLOC defence system database
At its core, the PADLOC web server is based on the PAD-
LOC command line tool ( https://github.com/padlocbio/
padloc), with a curated database of profile HMMs, HMM
scoring thresholds, and system models (https://github.com/
padlocbio/padloc-db). Our current understanding of de-
fence system genetics is the result of a collective scientific
effort, and the HMMs and system models in the PAD-
LOC database were built and curated using data from
many sources. Construction of HMMs for the CBASS and
Doron systems, plus several variant systems we discovered,
are as previously described (6). We have since expanded
the PADLOC web server database to contain> 180 sys-
tem definitions, including> 3,500 profile HMMs. Where
profile HMMs were made available by the authors of
papers describing new defence system types (10–12), or
databases and tools to detect subsets of systems (13–15),
these HMMs were assigned PADLOC HMM accessions
(e.g. PLDC12345) and added to the PADLOC database
(the original HMM names were retained for traceability).
Wheremultiplesequencealignmentswereavailable( 16,17),
we realigned the sequences using MUSCLE (18) and built
HMMs with HMMER3 (19). For cases without HMMs
or sequence alignments but a list of relevant proteins was
available (8,20–39), we either used our sequence clustering
and HMM generation pipeline described previously (6), or
alignedthesequenceswithMUSCLE,manuallycuratedthe
alignments to remove outlier sequences, then built HMMs
with HMMER3. In the absence of supplied lists of ho-
mologs, we used example sequences from experimentally
verified defence systems as seeds for BLAST searches, then
aligned, curated and built HMMs, as above (22,40–69).
Where possible, the data source and appropriate refer-
ence for each HMM is listed in the PADLOC database
HMM metadata file (hmm meta.txt, available from the
PADLOC database repository). We encourage PADLOC
users to recognize the importance and value of these data
usedtobuildthePADLOCwebserverbycitingtheoriginal
sources. Models will continue to be added and updated pe-
riodically as more defence systems are discovered. We wel-
come and encourage submissions of new defence systems,
includingHMMs,multiplesequencealignments,orlistsfor
relevantproteinsequencesordatabaseaccessions.Similarly,
feedback to improve the sensitivity and specificity of PAD-
LOC, updates to citation links, and suggestions to improve
defence system and protein nomenclature will help ensure
PADLOC remains a useful community resource.
Detection of non-coding sequences
Since the command line PADLOC tool detects only
protein-coding genes, yet many defence systems con-
tain non-coding RNAs, we integrated detection of
CRISPR arrays and retron-associated ncRNAs (msr-
msd elements) into the web server. CRISPR arrays are
detected with a customized version of CRISPRDetect
(70) using the arguments: array
quality score cutoff
2.5; minimum word repeatation 3; word length 11;
minimum no of repeats 3; repeat length cutoff 11;
max gap between crisprs 250. The resulting crispr.gff
output file is supplied to PADLOC using the –crispr input
option and the human-readable crispr.txt output file is
made available for user download. Potential ncRNAs asso-
ciated with retrons are identified by searching a database
of msr-msd element covariance models (available from the
PADLOC database repository), against each genome se-
quence using Infernal’s cmsearch (71) with the arguments:
Z10;FZ500.TheInfernaloutputisfilteredtoonlyinclude
hits passing the inclusion threshold (E-value= 0.01), then
loaded into PADLOC using the –ncrna input option.
In specific PADLOC system definition models (e.g. for
retrons), ncRNAs are listed as ‘ncRNA’ in the core, ac-
cessory or prohibited gene lists, as required. As such, any
identified ncRNAs contribute to the total required gene
count for each relevant defence system.
Precomputed RefSeq data and pseudogenes
For the precomputed PADLOC dataset (currently based
on RefSeq v209 (72)), we used the [assembly]
genomic.fna,
[assembly] genomic.gff and [assembly]protein.faa files for
each genome assembly from the RefSeq FTP server. First,
CRISPR arrays and retron-associated ncRNAs were iden-
tified by running CRISPRDetect and Infernal, respectively
(as above), with [assembly]
genomic.fna as input. The re-
sultingGFF-formattedCRISPRDetectoutputsweresaved
for input to PADLOC and the more detailed, human-
readable output files were loaded to the PADLOC web

server for user download. Next, we pre-processed the [as-
sembly] genomic.gff and [assembly]protein.faa files to al-
low increased detection of defence systems containing
pseudogenes. The NCBI prokaryotic genome annotation
pipeline (PGAP) identifies genes that contain frameshifts,
nonsense stop codons, or appear otherwise incomplete,
as pseudogenes (73). The coordinates of each pseudogene
are reported in the [assembly]
genomic.gff, but the corre-
sponding protein sequences are not included in the [assem-
bly] protein.faa.SincePADLOCreliesonanypotentialde-
fence system protein sequences to be present in the input

normally be identified. The PGAP annotates each pseudo-
gene with the accession of the full protein sequence used to

plus the CRISPR array and ncRNA inputs (as above).
Implementation
The core PADLOC tool is implemented in R, with some
input handling using Bash and Python (primarily Biopy-
thon (74)). The PADLOC web server was built using
the Django Framework (https://www.djangoproject.com).
Userjobsareidentifiedbyuniqueandanonymousjobiden-
tifiers and are not accessible by other users. Users can ac-
cesstheirresults(trackedusingcookies)untiltheirbrowser
cookiesarecleared,theresultsareremovedmanuallybythe
user, or until they expire (currently after 10 days). On the
user side, anonymous job identifiers are replaced with the
user-specificjobnameandoutputfilesdownloadedarepre-
fixed by the job name. When input filesare uploaded to the
server, a pre-processing script is used to detect the source
format of the files and convert these to the default inputs
for PADLOC (.gff and .faa with RefSeq formatting). For
example, RAST formatted Genbank files are identified by
the presence of the string ‘rasttk’, next the ‘db
xref’ field is
changed to ‘locustag’, finally Biopython is used to output
PADLOC-compatibleinputfiles.PADLOCalsocontainsa
‘–fix-prodigal’ option to natively parse Prodigal-formatted
.gff and .faa file pairs, which the pre-processing script de-
tects by searching for the string ‘Prodigal’ in the uploaded

ferent gene-calling settings to be used for inputs> 100
kb, versus shorter sequences (see the Prodigal documenta-
tion of an explanation of the rationale behind this). For
users wanting to analyse unannotated plasmid sequences,
we recommend including the host genome sequence within
a multi-fasta input file before uploading to the PADLOC
web server (to improve the quality of gene predictions with
Prodigal). Once PADLOC is run, the output is passed to a
post-processing script that reformats and outputs the data
in a custom machine-readable format that is used to gener-
ateaninteractivegenomeannotationdisplay(producedus-
ing d3.js (https://d3js.org/)) on the corresponding user-job
result page.
RESULTS
Input and file handling
Users can analyse archaea, bacteria, metagenome, phage,
archaeal virus and plasmid genome files from the ‘Run
PADLOC’ page. The PADLOC web server accepts Gen-
Bank flat files, nucleotide FASTA, or paired amino acid
FASTA and general feature format (GFF3) files as input
(Figure2A). If a GenBank file is provided, nucleotide, pro-
tein, and feature information (e.g. gene locations) is ex-
tracted using Biopython. If a nucleotide FASTA file is pro-
vided, Prodigal (75) is used to predict open reading frames
and produce a protein FASTA and GFF3 file. For the best
quality results, it is recommended that users supply a Gen-
BankfileoraminoacidFASTAandGFF3filewherecoding
sequences have already been called and verified (e.g. with
Prodigal or Prokka). Users may wish to download the ex-
ample genome files to see the expected formatting for each
file type (Figure2B). When nucleotide information is pro-
vided,eitherthroughaGenBankornucleotideFASTAfile,

Output and interpretation
Each job submitted by a user is listed on the ‘My Results’
page (Figure2C), which includes details of the job status
and links to completed jobs. If the job failed, a link is pro-
vided to download the corresponding log file. The most
common reason for a failed job is incorrect input format-
ting. For successful jobs, individual result pages contain
information about interpreting the output, an interactive
view of the locus structure of each detected defence sys-
tem(Figure 2D),asummarytableofsystemsdetected(Fig-
ure 2E), and options to download the output files (Fig-
ure 2F). The main PADLOC output file (.csv format) lists
all systems identified, with one gene per row. The file con-

ages should be treated with caution. In general, multi-gene

defence systems are detected with greater specificity than
systems encoded by singe genes.
Considerations and limitations
Aswithanycomputationalapproachtoinferringgenefunc-
tion,thereareseveralpotentiallimitationsthatusersshould
consider when interpreting PADLOC web server outputs.
Many defence proteins contain ubiquitous domains and
theirHMMsaremorelikelytodetectspurioushits.Forex-
ample, PtuA (Septu), several retron proteins and Old nu-
cleases contain similar ATPase domains (11). As a result,
PADLOC sometimes reports overlapping system classifi-
cations (typically less than 1% of results), which should
be resolved via subjective evaluation of the reported scor-
ing parameters and genetic context. For multi-gene sys-
tems, the synteny requirements resolve many ambiguities
and increase the confidence of system classification (due to
the reduced probability of two adjacent false-positive hits).
By contrast, identification of single-gene systems is more
challenging and requires trade-offs with the HMM scoring
cut-offs(E-valueandHMM /targetcoveragethresholds)to
achieve an acceptable balance between sensitivity versus
specificity. As such, false positive and negative results are
inevitablymorefrequentforsinglegenesystems.Ingeneral,
the PADLOC scoring thresholds are set more toward sen-
sitivity, with the intention that users interested in further
study of identified potential defence system homologs will
undertake additional analyses.
As a first step to curating PADLOC results, inspection
of the HMM and target alignment coverage scores can re-
veal potential false-positive classifications (Figure3A–C).
In some cases, very similar proteins differ in function due
to the presence or absence of enzymatic sites or functional
motifs (Figure3D). We encourage users to explore subse-
quentdomain-basedanalysesofdefencesystemproteinsus-
ing tools such as HHpred (76) to identify protein domains
with more granularity. We have also found structure pre-
diction tools such as AlphaFold2 (77) and ColabFold (78),
useful in identifying domain folds and boundaries. Once
demarcated, predicted domain structures can be searched
against protein structure databases such as the PDB (79)
or AlphaFold-based databases, using tools like DALI (80)
or Foldseek (81). In many cases, this structure-based ap-
proach reveals homologs with characterised active sites or
functional motifs, which can aid in discrimination between
defence system proteins and similar non-orthologous pro-
teins. Users may also find it informative to compare their
PADLOCresultswithDefenseFinder,anothertoolrecently
developed for defence system identification (82,83).
The similarity of several defence systems to other molec-
ular systems inevitably leads to a background rate of false-
positive system identifications. For example, Wadjet sys-
temsaresimilartoMukstructuralmaintenanceofchromo-
somes (SMC) systems (21,84,85)( F i g u r e3E). The canoni-
calWadjetsystemcomprisesfourproteinsJetABCD,where
JetA, JetB, and JetC share similarity with MukF, MukE,
and MukB, respectively. The PADLOC Wadjet system def-
initionrequiresthefullJetABCDsettobepresent,whereas
the MukFEB cases are reported as part of Wadjet ‘other’
systems. Several ‘[system]
other’ models (which generally
requireonlytwocomponentsofasystemtobeco-localised)
are run alongside the stricter canonical system definitions,
to enable identification of systems that might otherwise be
overlooked due to their being split by contig boundaries
(particularly in metagenomes) (Figure3F), fragmented by
multiple intervening genes (e.g. due to MGE insertions),
genes missing due to sequencing, assembly or gene-calling
errors, mutations, or high sequence divergence of some de-
fence proteins (Figure3G). For the precomputed RefSeq
data,wesubstitutedpseudogeneproductswithsimilarfull-
length protein sequences, which allows higher-confidence
assignment of the example system as Wadjet type I (Figure
3H). The identification of defence system pseudogenes will
also be helpful for studies of defence system evolution and
turnover.Forsomesystems,suchastheDndandPbephos-
phorothioation systems, several genes are relatively short
(includingdndE,pbeB/D)andareoftenmissedbygenepre-
diction tools (33,35). The ‘PT
other’ model will detect the
remaining genes and users should then manually check for
short coding sequences in the vicinity of the expected loca-
tion of any absent genes. Lastly, several system definition
models specify ‘optional’ genes (e.g. ‘cas
associated’ pro-
teins) that are not necessarily functionally associated with
the system. In some cases, these proteins may be unchar-
acterised independentbona fidedefence systems, or might
have non-defence functions. To guide users in interpreting
results for ‘other’ models and resolving ambiguities, each

known potential ambiguities.
The current snapshot of antiviral defence systems
To provide a current and comprehensive quantitative view
of the defence systems in bacteria and archaea, we used
PADLOC to search all RefSeq v209 Bacteria and Archaea
genomes. These results are available for browsing on the
PADLOC web server under the ‘RefSeq results’ page and
will be updated periodically with new RefSeq versions and
as new defence systems are discovered. Overall, the distri-
bution of different defence systems across different bac-
teria and archaea is highly varied (Supplementary Figure
S1). It should be noted that this analysis includes assem-
blies of varied completeness, and systems may be under-
represented in taxa with incomplete genomes. Clear differ-
ences in the diversity and abundance of defence systems
were apparent between phyla (Figure4A), with several no-
table outliers including Chlamydiota (very few known de-
fence systems) and Cyanobacteria (many types of defence
systems in high abundance). Campylobacterota had a sig-
nificant bimodal distribution of defence system abundance
(Hartigan’s dip test (86), P < 0.001), which relates to the
Helicobacteraceae relying on a remarkably large number
of restriction modification systems in each strain (Figure
4B,C)(87,88).AnotherinterestingphylawasSpirochaetota,

defence systems (Figure 4D). It remains to be resolved
whether the low defence diversity is driven by genome re-
duction and due to less exposure to phages and MGEs
than free-living relatives. Overall, these examples illustrate
that the PADLOC web server can be used to interrogate
hypotheses such as these and to then identify candidate
taxaandstrainsinwhichpredictionscanbeexperimentally

Toaddressthelackofcapableandaccessibletoolsforcom-

the web server is encouraged via the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/padlocbio/padloc/issues),includingbut
not limited to the addition of systems and HMMs, sugges-
tions for adjusting thresholds or system classifications and
nomenclature, and reporting bugs.
The comprehensive identification of many systems made
possiblewithPADLOCalsoopensavenuesforinvestigating
many interesting biological questions. For example, many
putative defence system genes are annotated as pseudo-
genes. Although pseudogenes can arise from sequencing or
assemblyerrors,theymightalsoincludetheremnantsofde-
fence systems that have become inactivated through muta-
tion. Investigation of these remnants could provide insight
into the ancestry and evolution of defence system arsenals
that would otherwise remain undetected. In addition, our
broad taxonomic analyses revealed notable differences in
the diversity and abundance of defence systems in many
taxa, raising the question of what factors drive the require-
ment for more defence against phages, and whether differ-
ences are driven by ecological factors such as phage diver-
sity and encounter rates (reviewed in92). Recent studies
