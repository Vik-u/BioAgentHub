Coenzyme A (CoA) transferases catalyze reversible transfer of CoA groups from
CoA-thioesters to free acids, playing important roles in the metabolism of carboxylic
acids in all organisms. An intramolecular CoA transferase, Mesaconyl-CoA C1-C4
CoA transferase (MCT) was identiﬁed in the autotrophic CO 2 ﬁxation pathway, 3-
hydroxypropionic acid cycle of ﬁlamentous anoxygenic phototrophs (FAPs). Different
from the well-known CoA transferases that catalyze CoA transfer between two distinct
substrates, MCT speciﬁcally catalyzes the reversible transformation of mesaconyl-C1-
CoA to mesaconyl-C4-CoA, a key reaction intermediate for carbon ﬁxation. However,
the molecular mechanism of MCT in employing one substrate is enigmatic. Here we
determined the crystal structure of MCT from a chlorosome-less FAP Roseiﬂexus
castenholzii at 2.5 Å resolution, and characterized the catalytic mechanisms through
structural analyses and molecular dynamic simulations. The structure of R. castenholzii
MCT consists of a Rossmann fold larger domain and a small domain that are connected
by two linkers. Two MCT subunits are cross interlocked at the linker regions to form
a functional dimer in solution, in which the substrate binding pockets are located at
the interface of the Rossmann fold larger domain from one subunit and the small
domain from the other subunit. In the simulated binding structures, both the substrate
mesaconyl-C1-CoA and product mesaconyl-C4-CoA form extensive electrostatic and
hydrogen bonding interactions with MCT. But some differences exist in the binding mode
of these two CoA analogs, Arg314’ from the second subunit of the dimer presenting
dramatic conformational changes in binding with mesaconyl-C4-CoA. Together with
Arg47 and one water molecule, a strictly conserved residue Asp165 are essential for
catalyzing the reversible intramolecular CoA transfer reaction, through the electrostatic
and hydrogen bonding interactions with the mesaconic tail of both the substrate and

INTRODUCTION
Coenzyme A (CoA)-transferases catalyze the reversible transfer
of CoA groups from CoA-thioesters to free acids, playing
essential roles in the metabolism of carboxylic acids in all
organisms. Based on the reaction mechanisms and amino acid
sequences, these enzymes are grouped into three types. The
reaction mechanisms of type I and II CoA transferases both
involve the alternate formation of thioester and anhydride
intermediates, but their catalytic mechanisms are quite diﬀerent
(Heider, 2001). The type-I enzymes catalyze CoA transfer
using a ping-pong mechanism that requires formation of the
CoA-thioester intermediate with a glutamate residue of the
enzyme, then the enzyme-CoA intermediate reacts with a CoA-
acceptor to proceed the reaction. The type-II CoA transferase
usually catalyzes a partial reaction of the citrate or citramalate
lyases that are comprised of a CoA-transferase ( α-subunit), a
lyase ( β-subunit) and an acyl carrier protein (ACP , γ-subunit)
(Buckel and Bobi, 1976; Subramanian et al., 1983). The catalytic
mechanism involves ternary-complex formation of the enzyme,
donor ACP-thioester (acetyl-ACP) and a thioester-acceptor
(citrate or citramalate), without formation of covalently bound
intermediates at the enzyme (Buckel et al., 1971; Buckel and Bobi,
1976; Malinin, 1977). Upon conversion of the thiol group of ACP
to an acetyl-thioester, the CoA-transferase subunit catalyzes the
exchange of free citrate or citramalate against the acetyl group
of ACP (Dimroth and Eggerer, 1975; Buckel and Bobi, 1976;
Mandal et al., 2000). Similarly, reaction of the type III CoA
transferase also requires formation of a ternary complex between
the enzyme and two substrates, but these enzymes employ
diﬀusible CoA-thioester instead of ACP-thioester as substrates
(Baetz and Allison, 1990; Leutwein and Heider, 1999; Dickert
et al., 2000; Elssner et al., 2001; Heider, 2001; Jonsson et al., 2004;
Friedmann et al., 2006).
In addition to the above-mentioned CoA transferases that
catalyze CoA transfer between two distinct substrates, an
intramolecular CoA transferase, Mesaconyl-CoA C1-C4 CoA
transferase (MCT) was identiﬁed in the autotrophic CO 2
ﬁxation pathway of a phototrophic bacterium Chloroﬂexus
aurantiacus (Zarzycki et al., 2009). As the representative species
of ﬁlamentous anoxygenic phototrophs (FAPs), C. aurantiacus
grow heterotrophically in the dark by aerobic respiration but

autotrophically in the light through photosynthesis (Pierson
and Castenholz, 1974; Strauss and Fuchs, 1993). Instead of
Calvin cycle, C. aurantiacus and many other FAPs ﬁx carbon
through a new metabolic pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate
(3-HP) cycle (Strauss and Fuchs, 1993). This cycle utilizes
bicarbonate instead of CO 2 as substrate, it also assimilates small
organic fermentation products even under anaerobic conditions.
Most importantly, the 3-HP cycle is coupled by two cycles
that ensure eﬃcient utilization of the substrates and reaction
intermediates. The ﬁrst cycle catalyzes acetyl-CoA and two
molecules of bicarbonate into one molecule of (S)-malyl-CoA,
which is then cleaved to glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA. The second
cycle starts from condensation of glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA
to a (2R, 3S)-β-methylmalyl-CoA, and ends with cleavage of (S)-
citramalyl-CoA into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. As a result, the
bicycle absorbs three molecules of bicarbonate and produces
one molecule of pyruvate, with consumption of 5 molecules
of ATP and 6 molecules of NADPH (Strauss and Fuchs, 1993;
Zarzycki et al., 2009).
In the second cycle, conversion of (2R, 3S) -β-methylmalyl-
CoA to (S)-citramalyl-CoA requires transfer of the CoA moiety
from the C1 to C4 carboxyl group of the C5-dicarboxylic
acid. However, neither free carboxylic acid nor free mesaconate
exchange with mesaconyl-CoA was observed in the reaction.
Zarzycki et al. (2009) identiﬁed and characterized a new CoA
transferase that does not use acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA as
CoA donors, nor free mesaconate, itaconate, ( R)-/(S)-malate
and ( R)-/(S)-citrate as CoA receptors. Instead, it speciﬁcally
catalyzes the intramolecular transformation of mesaconyl-C1-
CoA to mesaconyl-C4-CoA, and therefore named as MCT.
Sequence alignment with those of the type III CoA transferases
revealed a strictly conserved aspartate residue of MCT, which
seems to be capable of forming an acid anhydride with the CoA-
activated acid. Reaction of this anhydride with the inhibitor
compounds resulted in inactivation of the enzyme. However,
MCT was partially inactivated by hydroxylamine that forms a
hydroxamate at the CoA-activated glutamate residue of type I
CoA transferases (White and Jencks, 1976; Mack and Buckel,
1995; Selmer and Buckel, 1999). Additionally, the enzymatic
activity of MCT was nearly not aﬀected by sodium borohydride
that reduces the glutamyl-CoA (Mack and Buckel, 1995; Zarzycki
et al., 2009), indicating that the active site conformation and
catalytic mechanism of MCT are probably diﬀerent from other
CoA transferases. Especially, in comparison with the enzymes
that transfer CoA between two diﬀerent substrates, the molecular
mechanism of MCT in catalyzing the intramolecular CoA
transfer of only one substrate is enigmatic.

Min et al. Crystal Structure of an Intramolecular CoA Transferase
Here, we report the crystal structure of MCT from Roseiﬂexus
castenholzii, a chlorosome-less FAP that is closely related
to C. aurantiacus , wherein MCT was ﬁrst identiﬁed and
characterized (Hanada et al., 2002; Zarzycki et al., 2009).
Although no substrate or analog has been detected in the
structure, the binding modes of CoA, mesaconyl-C1-CoA
and mesaconyl-C4-CoA were obtained through structural
superimpositions and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Based on the crystal structure of apo-MCT and the characterized
binding features of these CoA analogs, we proposed a
molecular mechanism of R. castenholzii MCT in catalyzing
the intramolecular CoA-transfer reaction. The results of this
study provide structural basis for understanding the catalytic
mechanism of intramolecular CoA transfer reactions, it will
contribute to the diversity and molecular evolutions of CoA
transferases, and their applications in synthesis of 3-HP and other
important ﬁne chemicals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
The gene sequence encoding Mesaconyl-CoA transferase from
R. castenholzii strain DSM 13941 (NC_009767) was inserted into
pEASY-E1 expression vector at NheI and SacI restriction site to
construct a N-terminal 6 ×His-tagged recombinant expression
vector. After DNA sequencing, the plasmid with the correct
insert was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells,
the cells were grown in 1 L Luria-Bertani broth containing
100 mg mL −1 Ampicillin at 37 ◦C until the OD 600 reached
0.6–0.8. The gene expression was then induced with 0.1 mM
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 25◦C.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 r.p.m. for
15 min at 4◦C, and resuspended in 40 mL wash buﬀer containing
25 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.01%
Triton X-100 and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF)
prior to the homogenization with a high-pressure homogenizer
(Union, People’s Republic of China). The insoluble cell debris was
removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 ◦C. The
supernatant containing crude soluble proteins was loaded onto a
Ni2+-chelating aﬃnity chromatography column (GE Healthcare,
United States) and was rinsed with 100 mL binding buﬀer
(25 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20–50 mM imidazole)
to remove non-speciﬁcally bound proteins. The bound MCT
protein was eluted with the binding buﬀer containing 200 mM
imidazole. The eluates were further puriﬁed by a HiLoad 16/600
Superdex 200 PG size exclusion column (GE Healthcare, United
States) with buﬀer containing 25 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl to 95% purity.
Crystallization of the
Apo-Mesaconyl-Coenzyme A
Transferase and Heavy Atom Soaking of
the Crystals
The puriﬁed MCT protein was concentrated to 20 mg mL −1
at 4 ◦C using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlter device
(10 kDa molecular-weight cutoﬀ; Millipore, Germany). Protein
concentration was determined using a NanoDrop (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, United States) to measure the absorption at 280 nm.
Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapor
diﬀusion method, with 1.5 µL of protein sample mixed with
an equal volume of the reservoir solution, and then the drop
was equilibrated against 200 µL reservoir solution. Hexagonal
shaped crystals were obtained at 14 mg mL −1 with the
reservoir solution (14% PEG4000, 0.1M Li 2SO4, 0.1M Sodium
Citrate) at 16 ◦C. In order to determine the phase using single-
wavelength anomalous dispersion data, heavy atom soaking of
the crystals was performed. The puriﬁed MCT sample was
mixed with various heavy atom derivatives from the heavy
atom screen kit (Hampton Research, United States) at diﬀerent
concentrations. The homogeneity and binding properties of
the mixed samples were analyzed by Native-PAGE. Then the
derivatives represent the higher homogeneity with the MCT
protein were selected for soaking. Finally, the native-MCT
crystals were transferred and soaked in a solution containing
14% PEG4000, 0.1M Li 2SO4, 0.1 M Sodium Citrate, 2.5 mM
phenylmercury acetate, or 2.5 mM ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid,
sodium salt for soaking.
Crystal Data Collection, Structure
Determination, and Reﬁnement
The optimized native-MCT crystals and Hg-soaked derivative
crystals were cryo-protected by adding 25% glycerol to
the reservoir solution and ﬂash-frozen with liquid nitrogen,
respectively. A 2.5 Å resolution dataset of native-MCT was
collected at SSRF beamline BL19U1 with a 400 mm crystal-to-
detector distance at wavelength of 0.97892 Å. 360 diﬀraction
frames were collected with 1 ◦ oscillation per image. The
crystal belongs to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions
a = 364.413 Å, b = 210.118 Å, c = 73.476 Å, α = 90◦, β = 95.812◦,
γ = 90◦. The diﬀraction data of Hg-soaked derivative crystal was
also collected at SSRF BL19U1 with a 400 mm crystal-to-detector
distance at wavelength of 0.87250 Å and 720 diﬀraction frames
were collected with 0.5◦oscillation per image. A 2.9 Å dataset was
collected belonging to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions
a = 363.824 Å, b = 209.727 Å, c = 73.479 Å, α = 90◦, β = 95.535◦,
γ = 90◦(Table 1).
Diﬀraction data were processed, integrated, and scaled with
HKL3000R software (Minor et al., 2006). The data quality was
assessed using SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999), and the solvent
content was calculated using MATTHEWS_COEF from CCP4
(Matthews, 1968; Collaborative Computational Project, 1994).
The dataset of Hg-soaked derivative crystal was used for phasing
by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method, the
positions of Hg-atoms were determined and the initial model
was automatically built by AutoSol program (Terwilliger et al.,
2009) and initially reﬁned by Phenix-Reﬁne (Afonine et al., 2012).
Then the structure model was built using Coot (Emsley and
Cowtan, 2004) and reﬁned against the native dataset to 2.5 Å
resolution using Refmac5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) from CCP4
package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) and the
Phenix (Liebschner et al., 2019; Table 1).

Gel Filtration and Sedimentation Velocity
Analytical Ultracentrifugation
Gel ﬁltration and sedimentation velocity analytical
ultracentrifugation (AUC) were performed to check the
oligomerization state of MCT in solution. The puriﬁed MCT
sample was loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion
column (GE Healthcare, United States) and eluted with
buﬀer containing 25 mM Tris–Cl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl at
0.5 mL min −1. Sedimentation experiments were performed
on a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab XL-I ultracentrifuge
(Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, United States) using a 4-hole
An-60Ti rotor. Samples with an initial absorbance at 280 nm of
approximately 0.5–0.8 were equilibrated for 2 h at 20 ◦C under a
vacuum prior to sedimentation. The absorbance at 280 nm was
measured using a continuous scan mode during sedimentation at
55,000 rpm in 12 mm double-sector cells. The data were analyzed
using sedﬁt (Schuck, 2000).
Molecular Dynamics Simulation and
Binding Free Energy Calculations
The binding structure of MCT and CoA was constructed through
structure superimposition with the formyl-CoA transferase from
Oxalobacter formigenes (FRC, PDB ID: 1P5R) (Ricagno et al.,
2003), a member of the type III CoA transferase. Based on
the complex structure of MCT-CoA, the binding structures
of mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA were generated
under criteria that the mesaconyl-C1 and mesaconyl-C4 groups
form as much as possible electrostatic and hydrogen bonding
interactions with the surrounding amino acid residues of MCT.
Structure superimposition and editing were accomplished by
using the UCSF Chimera software (Pettersen et al., 2004).
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by
using the AMBER 12 software (Case et al., 2005). The
CoA, mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA bound MCT
structures were individually immersed into the center of a
truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules with
a margin distance of 10.0 Å. The environmental sodium
counterions were added to keep the system in electric neutrality.
The AMBER ﬀ14SB force ﬁeld was applied for MCT (Maier et al.,
2015). For the CoA, mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-
CoA, structure optimization was ﬁrstly performed with Gaussian
03 at the level of DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d) (Wang et al., 2022), then
their atomic partial charges were calculated using the restricted
electrostatic potential (RESP) method with a basis set of HF/6-
31G(d) (Bayly et al., 1993). The other force ﬁeld parameters of
CoA analogs were generated from the Generalized Amber Force
ﬁeld (GAFF) with the Antechamber module of Amber Tools
(Wang et al., 2004). Finally, by following the same procedure in
our previous report (Wang et al., 2019), MD simulations were
conducted with varied time scales, i.e., 200 ns for MCT-CoA
and 300 ns for MCT-mesaconyl-C1-CoA/mesaconyl-C4-CoA
binding structures.
Upon the equilibrium of MD simulations, the binding free
energies ( 1Gbind) between MCT and the bound CoA analogs
were obtained through the molecular mechanics/generalized
Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculation approach
(Kollman et al., 2000):
1Gbind =Gcomplex −(Gprotein +Gligand) (1)
1Gbind =1H −T1S ≈1EMM +1Gsolv −T1S (2)
1EMM =1EvdW +1Eele +1Eini (3)
1Gsolv =1GGB +1GSA (4)
where E MM is the gas phase interaction energy comprising
van der Waals energy (E vdW) and electrostatic energy (E ele).
Internal strain energy diﬀerence ( 1Eint) equals zero since no
contribution diﬀerence of bond, angle and torsion takes place.
Gsolv is the solvation free energy, including the contributions
form a polar part (G GB) and a non-polar part (G SA). 1GGB was
estimated using the generalized Born model with the interior and
exterior dielectric constants set to 4 and 80, respectively (Liu
et al., 2018). 1GSA was estimated using the LCPO algorithm:
1GSA = γ1SASA +β, where γ and β were set to 0.0072 and
0, respectively (Weiser et al., 1999). 200 snapshots were evenly
extracted from the last 40 ns of each MD trajectory for the
calculations of 1EvdW, 1Eele, 1GGB and 1GSA. The solute
entropy term T1S is sometimes approximated by normal mode
entropy (Genheden and Ryde, 2015), but such treatment rarely

RESULTS
Overall Structure of
Mesaconyl-Coenzyme A Transferase
From Roseiﬂexus castenholzii
To investigate the catalytic mechanism of MCT, we determined
the crystal structure of apo-MCT using the single wavelength
anomalous dispersion (Hendrickson et al., 1985; Rice et al., 2000)
data from the crystals soaked with Hg-derivatives. The ﬁnal
model was reﬁned to an Rwork of 15.9% and an Rfree of 19.2% at
2.5 Å resolution (Tables 1, 2). The structure covers the full-length
enzyme (Met1–Glu407) that consists of a Rossmann fold larger
domain (Residues M1-N216 and F340-E407) and a small domain
(Residues F231-P319), which are joined together by two linker
regions (Residues D217-A230 for linker 1 and Y320-M339 for
linker 2) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1 ). Two MCT
subunits are cross interlocked at the linker regions, wherein α5
(D135-L142), α7 (A163-T186), and α8 (L196-L207) from each
subunit are symmetrically interacted in the center, with two small
domains and two Rossmann fold larger domains distributed
at the top and bottom sides, respectively ( Figure 1B ). The
dimer interface is stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding and
salt bridge interactions with amino acid pairs Arg324–Asp219
(3.0 Å), Arg324–Asp217 (3.3 Å), Tyr320-Asn158 (2.6 Å), Asp330-
Lys197 (2.8 Å), and so on, as well as hydrophobic interactions
involve side chains of Tyr136-Tyr320-Leu227, Ile166-Val167, and
Met171 and so on (Supplementary Figure 2A). Both gel ﬁltration

and ultracentrifugation analyses showed thatR. castenholzii MCT
exists as a dimer in solution ( Supplementary Figures 2B,C ),
which is consistent with previous biochemical evidences that the
type III CoA transferases function as a dimer.
The C2 crystal of apo-MCT contains a hexamer of three
dimers in one asymmetric unit. The small domains of three
dimers are closely associated with each other at α11 (T263-
L273) and α12 (E280-A300) helices that are related by a threefold
rotational axis ( Supplementary Figure 3A ). The loop regions
(T148-A163) between α6 and α7 of six subunits are directing
into the center, forming a cavity with a diameter about 14 Å
at the threefold axis. At the interface, the guanidine side chains
of Arg285 and the main chain oxygen of Ala300 form weak
hydrogen bonding interactions, and π-π stacking interactions
are formed between the guanidine and imidazole side chains
of Arg288 and His299 ( Supplementary Figure 3B ). The PISA
analyses (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) revealed a CSS core of 1.0
and an average interface area of 6675.8 Å2 for the basic dimer unit
as shown in Figure 1B, which are contributed by the interactions
from 74 hydrogen bonds and 43 salt bridges. Theoretical
calculations predict a free energy of interaction ( 1Gint) of -
94.0 kcal mol −1 and dissociation ( 1Gdiss) of 115.9 kcal mol −1
for the dimer. Whereas the average interface area of other dimer
forms ranged from 88.5 to 392.1 Å 2, with a CSS score from
0.011 to 0.044 ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Therefore, the basic
unit of dimer assembly shown in Figure 1B represents the stable
biological assembly, and the hexamer assembly is formed due to
the crystal packing.
Superimposition of the MCT dimer with that of the type
III CoA-transferases reveals high structural similarity at the
Rossmann fold larger domains, whereas the conformations
of the small domain are dramatically diﬀerent ( Figure 2A ).
This is consistent with the multiple sequence alignment that
showed considerable amino acid sequence conservation in the
Rossman fold larger domains but less conservation in the small
domains ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Compared to the formyl-
CoA transferase from O. formigenes (FRC, PDB ID: 2VJQ)
(Ricagno et al., 2003) that contain much longer linker 1 loop
(Residues E226-V251), the corresponding loop are shorter in
the formyl-CoA: oxalate-CoA transferase from Acetobacter aceti
(FCOCT, PDB ID: 3UBM) (Mullins et al., 2012) and the formyl-
CoA transferase from E. coli (YfdW, PDB ID: 1PT5) (Gogos et al.,
2004; Toyota et al., 2008; Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure 1 ).
In contrast, absence of this loop in MCT leads to the removal
of a glycine-rich loop (G258-G261) that points directly into the
active site pocket of FRC and Yfdw, as well as the shorter glycine-
rich loop in FCOCT, creating a relatively larger substrate binding
pocket of MCT (Figure 2C).

Min et al. Crystal Structure of an Intramolecular CoA Transferase
or the reaction intermediate mesaconic acid. To explore the
catalytic mechanism of MCT, the binding structures of MCT with
substrate analog CoA, the reaction substrate mesaconyl-C1-CoA
and product mesaconyl-C4-CoA were generated, and their
binding features were characterized through molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. No drastic ﬂuctuations occurred at the root-
mean-square deviation (RMSD) values during MD simulations,
indicating the conformations of these complex structures are
rather stable ( Supplementary Figures 4A–C ). In addition,
the root-mean square ﬂuctuation (RMSF) proﬁles of the
binding complexes showed overall consistent pattern to that
of the crystal structure of apo-MCT, indicating binding of the
substrate analogs did not cause drastic conformational changes
to MCT ( Supplementary Figure 4D ). Two CoA molecules
were initially docked into the dimer of MCT through structural
superimposition with the (FRC, PDB ID: 1P5R) (Ricagno et al.,
2003), which gives a main chain RMSD of 2.378 and results in
binding of the CoA molecules at the interface of the Rossmann
fold larger domain from one subunit and the small domain from
the other subunit (Figure 3A).
In the equilibrated binding structures derived from MD
simulations, the adenine ring of the CoA is buried in a pocket
formed by several loop regions connecting α3-β3, α2-β2, α1-
β1 from top and α4-β4 at the bottom, wherein it is surrounded
by the side chains of Pro38, Phe36, Ile72, Trp106, and Phe101
(Figures 3A,B). The phosphate moiety is hydrogen bonded with
Arg75 NH2 (2.9 Å) and Arg104 NH2 (2.8 Å), respectively. The
CoA pantetheine O1 and O4 atoms are hydrogen bonded with the
NH2 atoms of Arg314’ (2.7 Å) and Asn252’ (2.9 Å) from the small
domain of the other subunit. On the other side, the pantetheine
tail is directing into the cavity formed byβ1-α1, β5-α5, and α6-α7,
wherein it is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the
NH2 of Asn100 (2.8 Å), the hydroxyl group of Ser132 (2.7 Å), and
the main chain oxygen of Glu133 (3.2 Å). At the end of CoA, the
thiol group forms one hydrogen bond with Asp165 OD2 (3.0 Å).
In the equilibrated mesaconyl-C1-CoA bound structure, the
adenine ring adopts similar spatial environment as CoA. The
ribose oxygen forms hydrogen bond with Arg75 NH2 (2.9 Å),
the phosphate O7 (3.0 Å), and O8 (2.9 Å) form hydrogen bonds
with the guanidine side chain of Arg104 ( Figures 3C,D ). The
pantetheine tail of mesaconyl-C1-CoA is hydrogen bonding with
NH2 of Asn100 (2.8 Å), and main chain nitrogen (3.2 Å) and
oxygen (2.9 Å) of Glu133. Importantly, the mesaconic end is
positioned into a slit formed by loop regions connecting α6-
α7 and β7’-α9’ , wherein it is coordinated by hydrogen bonding
interactions with Arg47 NH1 (2.7 Å) and electrostatic interaction
between the carbonyl C and Asp165 OD2 (3.4 Å) ( Figures 3C,D
and Supplementary Figure 5A).
In the equilibrated binding structure with mesaconyl-C4-CoA
(Figure 3E), the guanidine side chains of Arg104, Arg314’ , and
Ser132 undergo conformational changes as compared to the
mesaconyl-C1-CoA bound MCT ( Figures 4A,B ). The adenine
ring of mesaconyl-C4-CoA is coordinated in same conformation
as mesaconyl-C1-CoA, except an additional hydrogen bond
between the adenosine N6 atom and Asp37 OD2 (3.5 Å)
(Figure 3F ). Hydrogen bonding interactions are observed
between the ribose oxygen and Arg75 NH2 (3.1 Å), the ribose
phosphate oxygens with Arg104 NH1 of (2.8 Å) and NH2
(2.7 Å). Notably, the guanidine group of Arg314’ dramatically
ﬂipped toward the pantetheine tail of mesaconyl-C4-CoA and
hydrogen bonded with O9 (2.8 Å). Additionally, the pantetheine
tail are hydrogen bonded with the main chain oxygen (2.9 Å)
and nitrogen (2.9 Å) of Glu133. Although the conformation
of mesaconyl-C4-CoA changes in comparison with mesaconyl-
C1-CoA, the mesaconic end maintains a similar binding mode
with the surrounding Asp165 (2.7 Å) and Arg47 (2.9 Å)
residues (Figure 3F).
Binding Features Characterized From
Molecular Dynamics Simulation
To further explore the binding characteristics of MCT with the
CoA analogs, the binding aﬃnities were evaluated based on
the widely recognized molecular mechanics/generalized Born
surface area (MM/GBSA) calculation (Kollman et al., 2000).
As shown in Table 3, mesaconyl-C1-CoA exhibited the highest
binding free energies to MCT (1G = –90.33 kcal mol−1), whereas
CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA showed comparable binding free
energies, indicating mesaconyl-C1-CoA is more favorable for
binding to MCT. It is noted that electrostatic interaction ( 1Eele)
and polar solvation eﬀect ( 1GGB) contributed negatively and
positively to the binding with CoA, respectively ( Table 3 ).
In contrast, the binding free energies of mesaconyl-C1-CoA
and mesaconyl-C4-CoA were both contributed by a positive
1Eele and a negative 1GGB. Considering the adenine ring and
pantetheine tail of these CoA analogs are basically immobilized
with similar hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions
(Figures 3B,D,F), these reverse eﬀects are probably resulted from
the ligated mesaconic groups.
The binding free energy was further decomposed to identify
the per-residue contribution ( Figure 5 ). Phe16 contributed to
the binding through hydrophobic interactions with the alkyl
groups linked to the S atom of CoA analogs, more extensive
hydrophobic contacts resulted in increased contribution of free
energies to the binding of mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-
C4-CoA with MCT ( Figures 5A–C ). Through electrostatic
interactions with the phosphate group of CoA analogs, Arg75
and Arg104 made signiﬁcant contributions to free energies that
resulted in stable binding of the three analogs. The largest per-
residue contribution came from Phe101, which forms parallel
π-π interactions with the adenine ring of all the three CoA
analogs. Notably, Arg47 made considerable contributions to
the binding of mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA, but
almost no contribution to the binding of CoA ( Figures 5A–C).
This agreed well with the observations that no electrostatic and
hydrogen bonding interactions exist between Arg47 and the
terminal thiol group of CoA, due to lack of the ligated mesaconic
groups (Figures 3B,D,F). In contrast to the bindings of CoA and
mesaconyl-C4-CoA, Arg314’ from the other subunit of the dimer
showed negligible contribution to the binding of mesaconyl-C1-
CoA, which is also consistent with the characterized binding
conformations ( Figures 3B,D,F , 5). Therefore, Arg47, Arg75,
Phe101, and Arg104 are both essential for the binding of

Transferase Catalyzed Intramolecular
Coenzyme A Transfer
The mesaconic end of mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-
CoA were stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with
Asp165 and Arg47 ( Figures 3D,F). In the equilibrated binding
structure with mesaconyl-C1-CoA, no hydrogen bonding but
electrostatic interaction was observed between the carbonyl C1
atom and the hydroxyl group (OD2) of Asp165 (3.4 Å), providing
a prerequisite for hydrophilic attack at the C1 atom. On the
other side, the O2 atom of the mesaconic end was immobilized
in a chain of hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg47 NH1
(2.7 Å) and a water molecule (2.8 Å) (Supplementary Figure 5A).
Similar hydrogen bonding interactions were also observed for
the O2 atom of mesaconyl-C4-CoA. In contrast, mesaconyl-C4-
CoA was accommodated with a longer distance between the C4
atom and Asp165 OD2 (3.7 Å) ( Supplementary Figure 5B ).
Considering the strictly conservation of Asp165 with the catalytic
aspartate residues of type III CoA-transferases, Asp165 and Arg47
residues are essential for catalyzing the CoA transfer reaction.
Based on the crystal structure of apo-MCT and the
characterized binding features with mesaconyl-C1/C4-CoA, we
proposed a catalytic mechanism for the intramolecular CoA
transfer reaction ( Figures 6A,B ). At the close-to-neutral pH
environment of the cell, both Asp165 and mesaconyl-C1-CoA are
deprotonated, and Arg47 is protonated. Initially, the negatively
charged carboxyl oxygen of Asp165 launches a nucleophilic

attack at the carbonyl C1 atom of mesaconyl-C1-CoA, and
a proton involved in the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding
interactions at the reactant state is concomitantly extracted from
the guanidine group of Arg47 to the terminal carboxyl group
of mesaconyl-C1-CoA. Subsequent intramolecular electron
reorganization releases the CoAS − and forms an enzyme-
bound anhydride. The liberated CoAS −anion is then engaged
in a second nucleophilic attack at the carboxyl C4 atom of
mesaconyl-C1-CoA. With involvement of a water molecule, the
resultant tetrahedral intermediate is further converted to an
enzyme (Asp165)-bound CoA-thioester, generating hydroxide
ion and a new water. Subsequently, the released hydroxide
ion initiates a third nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl C1
atom of the enzyme-bound CoA-thioester, then the electron
rearrangement dissociates Asp165 from the CoA-thioester to
its original deprotonated state. Finally, mesaconyl-C4-CoA is
formed when a proton is extracted by the deprotonated guanine
sidechain of Arg47 (Figures 6A,B).
DISCUSSION
Coenzyme A transferases are essential enzymes for the
metabolism of carboxylic acids in all organisms, wherein
they catalyze the reversible CoA transfer reactions with
broad substrate speciﬁcity. In this study, we determined the

Min et al. Crystal Structure of an Intramolecular CoA Transferase
crystal structure of a novel intramolecular CoA transferase,
Mesaconyl-CoA C1-C4 CoA transferase (MCT) from a
green non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria R. castenholzii ,
and characterized its catalytic mechanisms through structural
analyses and MD simulations. The basic dimer unit observed
in the crystal structure is consistent with the ﬁndings that
R. castenholzii MCT exists as a dimer in solution. The substrate
mesaconyl-C1-CoA and product mesaconyl-C4-CoA are
coordinated at the interface between the Rossman fold larger
domain from one subunit and the small domain from the other
subunit of the dimer. In the equilibrated structures, Arg47 made
considerable contributions to the binding of mesaconyl-C1-
CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA, whereas Arg314’ from the other
subunit undergo dramatic conformational changes in binding
with mesaconyl-C4-CoA. Together with Arg47 and one water
molecule, a strictly conserved Asp165 residue are essential for
catalyzing the reversible intramolecular CoA transfer reaction,
through electrostatic and the hydrogen bonding interactions
with the mesaconic tail of both the substrate and product.
Mesaconyl-coenzyme A transferase was originally identiﬁed
in the 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) cycle of C. aurantiacus
(Pierson and Castenholz, 1974), the representative bacteria
of ﬁlamentous anoxygenic phototrophs (FAPs). FAPs are
phylogenetically distant from other anoxygenic photosynthetic
bacterium and form the deepest branch of photosynthetic
bacteria (Oyaizu et al., 1987). This type of organism has
acquired a “chimeric” photosynthetic system during evolution,
with their reaction center and associated antenna resembling
that of purple bacteria, whereas the light harvesting apparatus
is similar as that of green sulfur bacteria (Blankenship, 2010;
Hohmann-Marriott and Blankenship, 2011; Tang et al., 2011).
Notably, FAPs evolved a new type carbon ﬁxation pathway 3-
hydroxypropionic acid bicycle, instead of Calvin cycle during
evolution. This autotrophic pathway directly generates acetyl-
CoA and pyruvate, and assimilates small organic fermentation
products, such as acetate, propionate, or succinate even under
anaerobic conditions. Notably, the byproduct 3-HP is an
intermediate for the metabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate
(Ansede et al., 1999; Sunda et al., 2002; Yoch, 2002), a ubiquitous
osmoprotectant and antioxidant of algae (Todd et al., 2007;
Johnston et al., 2008). Therefore, investigation of the enzymes in
3-HP cycle is necessary for understanding the autotrophic carbon
ﬁxation mechanisms of early branch prokaryotic phototrophs.
Multiple sequence alignment of R. castenholzii MCT with
the type III CoA-transferases showed considerable amino acid
sequence conservation in the Rossman fold larger domains but
less conservation in the small domains, which is consistent
with the structural superimposition analyses ( Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1 ). These type III CoA-transferases are
mostly involved in anaerobic biochemical pathways, wherein
they play essential roles for activating speciﬁc organic acids for
subsequent decarboxylation, β-oxidation or elimination of α-
or β-hydroxy groups (Heider, 2001). The reaction mechanism
of type III CoA transferases requires formation of covalently
bound substrate intermediates with a conserved aspartate residue
of the enzyme (Gruez et al., 2003; Ricagno et al., 2003; Gogos
et al., 2004; Stenmark et al., 2004; Toyota et al., 2008). In the
reaction of butyrobetainyl-CoA:( R)-carnitine-CoA transferase
(CaiB), Asp169 initiates a nucleophilic attack at the substrate
γ-butyrobetaine-CoA to form a covalently bound intermediate
and release the CoAS −. Subsequently, the second substrate
carnitine reacts with the covalent intermediate to form a reactant
state, in which carnitine is also covalently bound to Asp169.
This reactant state is stabilized by the release of γ-butyrobetaine.
Then the CoAS − anion launches a second nucleophilic attack
at the enzyme-anhydride intermediate to produce carnityl-CoA
and regenerate the deprotonated Asp 169 (Stenmark et al., 2004).
In R. castenholzii MCT, the catalytic residue Asp165 is strictly
conserved with CaiB (Stenmark et al., 2004), the formyl-CoA
transferase from O. formigenes (FRC) and E. coli (YfdW) (Gogos
et al., 2004; Toyota et al., 2008), as well as formyl-CoA: oxalate-
CoA transferase from A. aceti (FCOCT) (Mullins et al., 2012) and
a CoA transferase III from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv3272)
(Karade et al., 2019; Supplementary Figure 1 ), indicating MCT
probably adopts a similar reaction mechanism as the type III
CoA-transferase.
However, MCT catalyzes the reversible transformation of
mesaconyl-C1-CoA to mesaconyl-C4-CoA, the only diﬀerence
of the substrate and product of this reaction is the position
of a methyl group. Compared to FRC that contain a much
longer linker 1 loops, absence of this region in MCT leads
to the removal of a glycine-rich loop that points directly into
the active site pocket of FRC, YfdW, and FCOCT, results in
a larger substrate binding pocket of MCT ( Figures 2B,C ),
which could provide enough space for the intramolecular CoA
transfer reactions. Based on the MD simulations, mesaconyl-
C1-CoA exhibited higher binding free energies, indicating
mesaconyl-C1-CoA is more favorable for binding to MCT.
In the equilibrated structures, the mesaconic tails of both
mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA were stabilized
by a chain of hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg47
NH1 and one water molecule ( Supplementary Figures 5A,B ).
Particularly, electrostatic interactions between the carbonyl
C1 atom and Asp165 OD2 provided a prerequisite for
hydrophilic attack of the reaction. Therefore, we proposed
a previously unrecognized catalytic mechanism that involves
formation of covalently bound intermediates with Asp165,
and the participation of the less conserved Arg47 and water
molecule. In this reaction mechanism, the water molecule
takes place the role of the second substrate in type III
CoA-transferases, providing protons for the enzyme-bound
CoA-thioester and launching a nucleophilic attack to release
the Asp165 and generate mesaconyl-C4-CoA. Therefore, the
close proximities of the catalytic triad Asp165, Arg47, and
a water molecule inside the active site pocket ensured
occurrence of the reversible CoA-transfer reaction within
only one substrate.
In conclusion, this study revealed the catalytic mechanism
of an uncommon intramolecular CoA-transfer reaction in the
3-HP cycle of FAPs. As ancient anoxygenic photosynthetic
bacteria, FAPs evolved an autotrophic bicycle to ensure
suﬃcient utilization of the reaction intermediates for
metabolism. Additionally, many multi-functional enzymes
constitute an eﬃcient carbon ﬁxation system of the 3-
HP cycle, in total 19 reactions are catalyzed by only
13 enzymes. Therefore, the intramolecular CoA transfer

activity of MCT is also an economical and energy saving
approach for eﬃcient CoA shift of this autotrophic carbon
ﬁxation pathway. Besides the physiological importance, the
mechanism of MCT in catalyzing intramolecular CoA transfer
reaction can be applied to enzyme engineering or manipulations
of the 3-HP cycle for synthesis of ﬁne chemicals and important
metabolites in the future.
