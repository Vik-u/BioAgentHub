Abstract
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose can result in potentially fatal acute liver failure, with
free radical formation identified as a major mechanism of liver tissue damage. Micromeria
frivaldszkyana (M. frivaldszkyana), a rare species endemic to Bulgaria, has demonstrated
significant antioxidant activity. Male Wistar rats were treated orally for 7 days with saline;
250, 400, or 500 mg/kg of a water solution of dried methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana;
100 mg/kg rosmarinic acid (RA); or 125 mg/kg silymarin. Liver toxicity was induced
by oral application of 2000 mg/kg APAP on the last day of treatment. Forty-eight hours
later, blood and livers were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. The re-
sults revealed that treatment with 500 mg/kg of the dried methanolic extract significantly
reduced the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, mal-
ondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in APAP
overdose. The present results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that pre-treatment
with methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana results in significant hepatoprotective effects in
the APAP-induced rat model of liver injury. The mechanism of this effect may involve cell
membrane protection, decreased lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, and attenuation of
aseptic inflammation. These effects can be attributed to the main compounds identified in
the extract (linarin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, eupatorin, apigenin, RA).

1. Introduction
Paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, APAP) is a widely used over-
the-counter drug available in various formulations. It is commonly used worldwide as
an analgesic and antipyretic agent [1,2]. Although considered safe at therapeutic doses,
APAP overdose can result in potentially fatal acute liver failure. According to recent
reports, nearly 20% of poisoning-related deaths in the United States are attributed to APAP
exposure [2].
At therapeutic doses, APAP is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation and
sulfation pathways into non-toxic metabolites, which are excreted in the urine [3]. A small
fraction undergoes oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2),
resulting in the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI induces
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocellular necrosis through covalent
binding to liver proteins [2,4]. NAPQI can be neutralized by conjugation with glutathione
(GSH), and the resulting complex is excreted renally. However, in overdose situations,
excessive NAPQI production overwhelms GSH capacity, leading to liver damage [1,4].
APAP-induced toxicity is primarily mediated by the generation of free radicals and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5]. ROS are normally neutralized by antioxidant enzymes
such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
Depletion of these enzymes is closely associated with tissue damage due to oxidative
stress. Additionally, ROS trigger lipid peroxidation, leading to disruption of cell mem-
branes [6]. The latter is indicated by a well-documented increase in the levels of malondi-
aldehyde (MDA) [7]. APAP-driven oxidative stress is also associated with deoxyribonu-
cleic acid (DNA) modifications, notably a marked increase in the levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-
deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) [8]. Several comprehensive reviews have highlighted the role
of inflammation and oxidative cell damage in NAPQI-mediated organ injury, along with
the involvement of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-
6 (IL-6) [9,10]. Furthermore, APAP hepatotoxicity is directly linked to increased serum
levels of the hepatic transaminase enzymes—aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) [11]—as well as with hyperbilirubinemia [12].
In recent years, interest in plant-derived compounds with hepatoprotective properties
has grown significantly. Furthermore, silymarin, a flavonoid complex extracted from Sily-
bum marianum (milk thistle), has a well-documented history of over 50 years in the treatment
of liver disorders, including viral hepatitis and alcohol-induced liver injury [13]. Hepato-
protective properties have also been reported for various plant-derived compounds [14],
plant extracts [1,15], and even certain mushrooms, such as Pleurotus ostreatus [6].
Micromeria frivaldszkyana (M. frivaldszkyana), a rare plant species of the Lamiaceae fam-
ily, is endemic to Bulgaria [16]. Scientific data on this species are scarce, and its pharmacolog-
ical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have described the phytochemical
profile of its methanolic extract and assessed its safety in acute and subchronic application
in rats [17,18]. The extract demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity in a rat
paw edema model [17]. Furthermore, a comparative in vitro study involving methanolic
extracts from M. frivaldszkyana, M. dalmatica, M. juliana, and M. cristata showed that M.
frivaldszkyana exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in a 2,2′-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) radical scavenging assay [19]. The extract also demonstrated antibacterial activity,
notably reducing the growth of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111 at a minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of 10 mg/mL [ 16]. Other members of the Lamiaceae family, such
as Stachys germanica (essential oil), have also been reported to exhibit antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory activities, possibly due to the presence of constituents such as bornyl
acetate and camphor [20].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 3 of 20
In a previous study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrom-
etry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis ofM. frivaldszkyana methanolic extract led to the identification
of 192 compounds. Phenolic acids and flavonoids—primarily as flavonoid glycosides—
were the predominant secondary metabolites. Among them, linarin and its derivatives,
chlorogenic acid, rutin, eupatorin, and rosmarinic acid (RA) were present in the highest con-
centrations [17]. These compounds have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
properties [21–23]. Furthermore, linarin, RA and chlorogenic acid were found effective
against liver toxicity in vivo and in vitro [24–26].
Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that the methanolic extract ofM. frivaldszkyana
may attenuate liver damage induced by APAP overdose in rats.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of orally administered water
solution of dried methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana against APAP-induced liver injury
in rats. Organ damage severity was assessed via histological analysis and quantification of
serum and tissue levels of specific biomarkers.
2. Results
Effect of Methanolic Extract of M. frivaldszkyana in AP AP-Induced Liver Toxicity
As shown in Figure 1, normal liver architecture was observed in the control rats
(Figure 1a) and in the rats treated with 500 mg/kg methanolic extract without APAP admin-
istration (Figure 1b). The most significant pathological changes were detected in the rats
that received an APAP overdose and saline (Figure 1c). In this group (APAP+S), hepatic
cell necrosis, dilation of sinusoids, parenchymal hemorrhages, inflammatory and Kupffer
cell infiltration, as well as disruption of normal liver architecture were observed. Treatment
with the methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana (Figure 1d–f) reduced the severity of liver
damage, however not to the extent observed in rats treated with silymarin (Figure 1h).
A reduction in liver damage was also observed in rats treated with RA (Figure 1g); how-
ever, the decrease was more pronounced in the groups treated with silymarin and with
500 mg/kg methanolic extract (Figure 1f,h).
In the Control S group, the quantitative analysis showed no evidence of necrosis, sinu-
soidal dilation, or inflammatory infiltration. Similarly, in the ME500 group, no pathological
alterations were detected; necrosis, sinusoidal dilation, and inflammatory infiltration were
completely absent (0%). In contrast, the APAP+S group displayed the most severe patholog-
ical changes. Necrosis affected approximately 50% of hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilation was
markedly increased (80%), and inflammatory infiltration was severe, accompanied by clear
disruption of the normal hepatic architecture. In the 250 mg/kg methanolic extract + APAP
group, necrosis was observed in 15% of hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilation was present in 30%
of the liver tissue, and inflammatory infiltration was moderate. The 400 mg/kg methanolic
extract + APAP group showed comparable findings, with necrosis limited to 15%, sinu-
soidal dilation reduced to 20%, and moderate inflammatory infiltration. The 500 mg/kg
methanolic extract + APAP group exhibited results similar to those of the silymarin group.
Necrosis was restricted to 8% of hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilation remained at 10%, and
inflammatory infiltration was mild. In the RA+APAP group, necrosis was reduced to
18%, sinusoidal dilation reached 20%, and inflammatory infiltration was moderate. In the
Silymarin+APAP group, only minimal pathological changes were observed. Necrosis was
restricted to 7% of hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilation was limited to 10%, and inflammatory
infiltration was mild.
No statistically significant changes were observed in total and conjugated bilirubin
levels (Figure 2a,b).

3. Discussion
The liver injury, which occurs in APAP overdose, is induced by elevated levels of
NAPQI. This metabolite is produced through APAP oxidation by CYP450 enzymes and is
usually neutralized by GSH. However, excessive production of NAPQI leads to depletion of
GSH and liver injury through covalent binding of NAPQI to cellular proteins. Centrilobular
hepatocytes are mainly affected by the mechanisms of oxidative stress, mitochondrial
dysfunctions, and inflammation, ultimately resulting in cell necrosis [ 27]. The initial
formation of ROS in the cytosol is followed by oxidative stress and the formation of
protein adducts in the mitochondria. This induces mitochondrial membrane damage and
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 10 of 20
subsequent hepatic cell necrosis [ 28]. However, the mechanism of APAP-induced liver
injury is more complex, involving the processes of autophagy, sterile inflammation, liver
repair, and regeneration [29].
The standard treatment of APAP overdose is based on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) ap-
plication. NAC is a GSH precursor, which has been used as an antidote for 50 years.
By increasing the levels of GSH, NAC reduces NAPQI toxicity and alleviates oxidative
stress [30,31]. GSH is the main protective molecule against NAPQI-induced liver damage.
In this study, elevated levels of GSH were observed after treatment with RA and silymarin,
and similar results were reported by Dkhil et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2013) [1,32].
The present study revealed a significant increase in the levels of AST and ALT in rats
with APAP overdose, which indicates the primary injury of the hepatocyte membranes.
Pre-treatment with RA, silymarin, and methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana reduced the
severity of the injury. The optimal results were achieved by silymarin, RA, and the highest
dose of the extract. The results are consistent with other authors, who reported decreased
levels of hepatic enzymes after treatment with silymarin [ 1] and RA [ 7]. Moreover, the
results are supported by the histopathological observation, as described in Figure 1. In
contrast to Dkhil et al. (2019), we did not register any significant changes in the serum
levels of total and conjugated bilirubin [1].
The essential role of oxidative stress in APAP-induced liver toxicity was discussed
above and supported by the registered low levels of CAT in the APAP+S group. Silymarin
and RA significantly increased this antioxidant enzyme, and these results align with Dkhil
et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2013) [1,32]. Interestingly, the extract of M. frivaldszkyana did
not induce elevation of SOD or CAT levels in liver tissue. This observation suggests that the
hepatoprotective effects of the extract are not mediated via upregulation of cell-protective
antioxidant enzymes. However, the involvement of other antioxidant mechanisms cannot
be excluded.
The other biomarker related to oxidative stress, MDA, was significantly reduced in rats,
who received the highest dose of the extract. Although decreases were also noted at lower
doses, they did not reach statistical significance. This suggests reduced lipid peroxidation
after treatment with M. frivaldszkyana extract. Moreover, suppression of lipid peroxidation
is of primary importance for maintaining the normal function of the hepatocyte mem-
brane [15]. This mechanism may explain the observed effect of the extract on the AST and
ALT levels. Overall, our results revealed the potential protective effect of the methanolic
extract of M. frivaldszkyana on the hepatocyte membrane and its hepatoprotective properties
in APAP overdose.
As mentioned before, plants from the Lamiaceae family have significant antioxidant
activity [16]. Nikolova et al. (2017) performed a DPPH assay on methanolic extracts
from various Micromeria species (M. juliana, M. cristata, M. frivaldszkyana, and M. dalmat-
ica). The authors observed the highest antioxidant activity in M. frivaldszkyana and M.
dalmatica [19]. More recent studies have further confirmed the strong antioxidant prop-
erties of M. frivaldszkyana extract. Mladenova et al. (2021) assessed this activity of M.
frivaldszkyana extract using multiple complementary assays, including DPPH, 2,2-azinobis
(3)-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP),
cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and oxygen radical absorbance ca-
pacity (ORAC) [16]. Their findings indicated that the ORAC value of M. frivaldszkyana
(3250.5 ± 208.1 µmol TE/g) is significantly higher than that of many other traditionally
used Bulgarian medicinal plants [33].
Oxidation can also occur with DNA, resulting in the formation of 8-OH-dG. Elevated
levels of this molecule are used as a marker of oxidative DNA damage. Wang et al. (2015)
reported increased 8-OH-dG in rodents after prolonged treatment with APAP [34]. The
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 11 of 20
results of the current study showed a similar increase after a single APAP overdose. A
significant decrease was detected in all experimental groups, with the most pronounced
effect observed in groups receiving 400 and 500 mg/kg of the extract. In general, the
extract induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in this parameter. Based on this,
we propose DNA protection as one of the mechanisms underlying the observed liver
protection. Moreover, the DNA damage plays an important role in carcinogenesis, which
implies further research into the anti-tumor properties of this extract [35].
Excessive ROS production initiates cellular signaling pathways, that upregulate the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes [1]. The APAP-induced hepatocyte necrosis
is followed by aseptic inflammation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,
IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α). Regarding the IL-6 levels, we found no statistical difference between
the groups, and our results align with [36]. The decreased levels of TNF-α in the groups
treated with 400 and 500 mg/kg methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana suggested the
involvement of the anti-inflammatory properties of the extract in its hepatoprotective effect.
Previously, the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract was reported by Stavrakeva et al.
(2024) in a model of rat paw inflammation [17]. In contrast to other authors, who reported
decreased levels of this cytokine in the same model of APAP-induced liver toxicity after
treatment with silymarin, our results did not indicate such differences. This discrepancy
may be due to differences in silymarin dosage [1]. The observed reduction in TNF-α levels
may be attributed to the high linarin content in the methanolic extract. Ellapan et al. (2022)
evaluated the effect of Ceiba pentandra extract on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver
toxicity. The authors reported decreased TNF-α level in the rats, treated with the extract
and explained this effect with the presence of linarin in the ethanolic extract [37]. Similarly,
metabolomic analysis of M. frivaldszkyana extract identified linarin as the predominant
compound [17]. In silico studies have demonstrated a high affinity of linarin for TNF- α
converting enzyme. This cytokine is released by Kupffer cells following acute liver injury,
which can be induced by hepatotoxic substances challenge [37].
Linarin (also known as acacetin 7-O-rutinoside) is a flavonol glycoside isolated from
plant species from the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae families, and genera Mentha, Microme-
ria, and Satureja are described as particularly rich in linarin [ 38]. Among the numerous
biological activities attributed to this compound, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hep-
atoprotective properties are of particular interest [24,38]. Linarin has been found effective
in CCl4-induced liver toxicity, leading to decreased MDA levels in vitro [24]. The oral
administration of some bioactive compounds in vivo may result in low plasma levels due
to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract or obstructed absorption by the mucus [ 39].
However, a pharmacokinetic study showed rapid absorption after oral administration in
rats, with appropriate distribution of linarin and its metabolites in liver tissue [40]. This
report allows us to hypothesize that the observed hepatoprotective effect may be partially
related to the high content of linarin in the extract. However, one should keep in mind that
all compounds may contribute to the observed effect, not only those present in the highest
amounts [41].
Hepatoprotective properties have also been reported for chlorogenic acid, eupatorin,
rutin, apigenin, naringenin, and RA, which are also abundant in the methanolic extract of
M. frivaldszkyana. Chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid) is a phenolic compound found
in significant quantities from coffee, apples, pears, berries, etc. The application of this
compound alleviates hepatocellular injury and liver steatosis, reducing serum AST and ALT
levels in mice with diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [42]. Decreased serum levels
of hepatic enzymes by chlorogenic acid were also reported by Hu et al. (2020) in a model of
APAP-induced liver injury in mice [43]. In the same model, chlorogenic acid was shown to
promote liver regeneration and repair [44]. Additionally, it has been reported to alleviate the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 12 of 20
hepatic injury in several models of hepatotoxicity by decreasing apoptosis, inflammation,
and oxidative injury caused by methotrexate and heavy metals [ 45]. Increased levels of
GSH, SOD, CAT, along with decreased MDA level were reported by Feng et al. (2016)
in a model of d-galactose-induced liver toxicity in mice. The authors found a significant
decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 following chlorogenic acid
treatment [46].
Eupatorin is another compound with a possible role in the observed effect of the extract.
This flavone is a weak acid and undergoes biotransformation to 51 metabolites in rats.
Eupatorin demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in rodent models of paw edema [47].
Rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) showed hepatoprotective activity in a model of
CCl4-induced liver toxicity in rats. Decreased mortality and lower serum levels of ALT
and AST were observed in pre-treated animals [ 48]. The hepatoprotective properties of
rutin may also be attributed to decreased TNF-α level in rats with deltamethrin-induced
hepatotoxicity [49].
Goudarzi et al. (2021) reported restoration of AST, ALT, MDA, and TNF-α levels after
apigenin administration in a rat model of methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. Treated
animals also showed increased levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH compared to those treated only
with methotrexate. The authors propose the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of
apigenin as a possible mechanism for the observed effects [50].
Similarly, Ahmed et al. (2019) registered reduced serum AST, ALT, and TNF-α levels
in rats with APAP-induced liver toxicity after following treatment with naringin and
naringenin [51].
Rosmarinic acid, an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, is a com-
mon compound in many plants, and its biological effects are widely explored. Antibacterial,
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties are documented in vivo and in vitro [52].
This phenol carboxylic acid has shown hepatoprotective activity in a wide spectrum of
experimental models, including liver injury induced by diabetes, CCl 4, and tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (t-BHP) [53]. In a rat model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, RA in a dose
of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the elevated levels of AST, ALT, MDA, while increasing
hepatic GSH levels [ 7]. In this study, we detected the same changes in AST, ALT, and
GSH. Although MDA levels decreased in the RA-treated group, the reduction did not reach
statistical significance, which may be attributed to differences in the experimental protocol.
As mentioned above, RA was reported as one of the compounds present at the highest
concentrations in the methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana [17]. We included a group
treated with RA to evaluate the similarity between the effects of RA and the extract. Table 1
compares the highest dose of the extract with the two positive controls (RA and silymarin).
The changes in the main biomarkers of liver function (AST and ALT) induced by the extract
and RA are identical, and the same applies to the levels of SOD. These results allow us to
speculate that the abundance of RA in the methanolic extract may be responsible for some
of the observed effects. However, in the extract, all components act synergistically and this
hypothesis is further supported by the different results obtained for the two groups with
respect to CAT, GSH, and MDA levels (Table 1).
Based on the current results, we can speculate that the mechanism of the observed
hepatoprotective effect could be attributed to cell membrane protection, decreased lipid
peroxidation and DNA damage, and attenuation of aseptic inflammation. However, the
mechanism of APAP-induced liver toxicity is more complex and involves the formation of
peroxynitrite and adducts of NAPQI to mitochondrial proteins, as well as an influence on
signaling pathways with an essential role in cell survival and aseptic inflammation [1]. The
present study sheds light on only a limited aspect of the mechanisms potentially modulated
by the methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana. The contribution of additional pathways
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 13 of 20
cannot be excluded and will be the subject of future investigations. Given the strong
antioxidant properties of the extract, investigation of its effectiveness against other animal
models of liver toxicity, as well as other organs, is also in the scope of our future research.

Limitations and Future Directions
The following limitations apply to this study: only male Wistar rats were used in the
experiment; using a different sex, strain, or route of administration may yield different
outcomes. The experiment was performed after 7 days of application of the extract, and
longer pre-treatment may have different effects. The APAP toxicity was induced by a single
overdose, and the outcome may differ in the case of chronic APAP administration. The
present study is limited to exploring the effects of the methanolic extract ofM. frivaldszkyana
in APAP-induced overdose in rats. The specific pathways and target molecules remain to be
elucidated and are beyond the scope of the current experiments. IL-6 and TNF-α levels were
measured in the groups S, ME500, S+APAP , ME250+APAP , ME400+APAP , ME500+APAP ,
and Sil+APAP . The RA+APAP group was excluded due to insufficient biological material.
In-depth mechanistic studies and extract standardization are necessary to ensure future
translational potential.

4.2. Plant Material and Preparation of the Methanolic Extract
The aerial parts of M. frivaldszkyana (approximately 800 g of fresh biomass) were
harvested during the 2023–2024 vegetation season from the Bulgarka Nature Park, located
in the Middle Stara Planina floristic region, in accordance with previously established
protocols [17,18]. The herbarium of the Agricultural University in Plovdiv (SOA) houses
the voucher specimen (accession № 062648). The plant material was dried for 10 days
in a shaded area at a controlled ambient temperature of 22 ± 2 ◦C. Drying was deemed
complete when leaf stalks fractured upon bending and the petioles crumbled easily under
pressure. Following this, the dried material was milled to a fine powder with an average
particle size below 400 µm using a GRINDOMIX GM200 laboratory mill (RETSCH GmbH,
Haan, Germany).
To prepare the methanolic extract, 10 g of the powdered sample was macerated in
70% methanol (1:10 w/v) for 24 h at room temperature (22 ± 2 ◦C) with continuous stirring
in a light-protected container. To improve extraction efficiency, the sample underwent
ultrasonication in three 15-min cycles at 30 ◦C. The next step included centrifugation at
6000× g for 15 min, and filtration of the supernatant using Whatman No. 1 filter paper
(Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA). The residual plant material was subjected to the
same extraction process twice more. The solvent was removed from the combined extracts
using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) under reduced pressure at
50 ◦C [17,18]. The extraction yield was 54.8% of the initial dry plant material, corresponding
to 5.48 g of dried extract.
4.3. Animals and Treatment
A total of 56 male Wistar rats (body weight 210–260 g) were used in the study. They
were randomly assigned to eight groups, each comprising seven animals. The animals were
maintained under standard laboratory conditions, including a temperature of 22 ± 1 ◦C,
relative humidity of 45%, and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, with unrestricted access to food
and water.
We followed the protocol for APAP-induced liver toxicity described by Ahmed et al.
(2023) [4]. After a one-week acclimatization period, the animals were treated orally for
7 consecutive days according to the following group assignments:
Groups 1 (S, control) and 3 (S+APAP) received saline at a dose of 0.1 mL/100 g
body weight (bw); group 2 (ME500) received 500 mg/kg of a water solution of the dried
methanolic extract; groups 4, 5, and 6 (ME250+APAP , ME400+APAP , ME500+APAP) were
treated with 250, 400, and 500 mg/kg water solution of the dried methanolic extract,
respectively; group 7 (RA+APAP) received 100 mg/kg RA; group 8 (Sil+APAP) was treated
with 125 mg/kg silymarin.
On the evening of day 6, all animals were fasted for 12 h with free access to water.
On day 7, the groups S+APAP , ME250+APAP , ME400+APAP , ME500+APAP , RA+APAP ,
and Sil+APAP received 2000 mg/kg of APAP via gastric gavage. Three hours later, the
respective treatment (extract or compound) was applied to each group. Animals were
euthanized 48 h after APAP administration. Blood and liver samples were collected.
Portions of each organ were fixed for histopathological analysis, while the remaining tissue
was stored at −80 ◦C and later homogenized for biochemical evaluation.
The duration of pre-treatment prior to APAP administration was selected based on
previous studies evaluating the protective effects of plant extracts and natural compounds
in APAP-induced liver injury models [1,7,54]. The dose and duration of APAP adminis-
tration were also based on a review of the literature. The methanolic extract doses were
determined according to recommendations by Hanafy et al. (2016), which suggest using
1/10 and 1/20 of the estimated LD 50 for pharmacological testing [ 55]. In our previous
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 15 of 20
study, we demonstrated the safety of M. frivaldszkyana extract at single oral doses up to
5000 mg/kg [17]. The intermediate dose of 400 mg/kg was included to better characterize
the extract’s dose-dependent effects.
The dose of RA was selected based on the study by Hasanein et al. (2017), which
demonstrated its beneficial effect in the APAP-induced liver toxicity model [7]. Silymarin,
a well-known hepatoprotective agent, was used as a positive control and its dose was also
selected based on published data [56].
4.3.1. Histopathological Observation
The experimental protocol was based on the description of other authors [57–59] and
was reported previously [18].
Immediately following collection, the organs were placed in a 10% neutral-buffered
formalin solution to ensure proper fixation. The fixed samples were subsequently pro-
cessed and embedded in paraffin blocks. The entire histological preparation included the
following steps:
1. Tissues were immersed in formalin for 24 h, thoroughly rinsed, and then soaked in
distilled water for 30 min to eliminate any residual fixative.
2. Dehydration was achieved through progressive immersion in 95% and then 100%
ethanol (Histanol® 100%), each step lasting 4–5 h.
3. After dehydration, the tissues were treated with acetone for 20 min, followed by xylol
for 30 min. They were then embedded in molten paraffin and formed into blocks.
Thin slices, 5 µm in thickness, were obtained from these blocks and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination.
Histopathological analysis was performed independently by two pathologists who
were blinded to the experimental groups. Morphological alterations in the tissues from
treated groups were compared to controls. Leica DM500 (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wet-
zlar, Germany) and Zeiss AXIO Scope A1 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany)
microscopes were used for sample observation.
Liver samples were examined for pathological changes such as architectural disruption,
portal and lobular inflammation, sinusoidal dilation and congestion, granuloma formation,
necrosis, degeneration, and steatosis. Tissue pathology was classified according to the
Roenigk scoring system (Table 2).

4.3.2. Preparation of Liver Homogenates and Evaluation of Tissue-Specific
Toxicity Markers
On the day of the analysis, the frozen liver tissues were brought to room temperature
and homogenized in a lysis 0.1 M PBS buffer with added Triton 100× (1:9 w/v), pH 7.4 [61]
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 9112 16 of 20
on a Polytron mechanical homogenizer (KINEMATICA, Malters, Switzerland). The ob-
tained whole-liver homogenates were afterwords centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at
4 ◦C using MPW-352R centrifuge (Warsaw, Poland) [62] and the resultant supernatant was
used for the assessment of the following parameters: (1) oxidative cell damage and antioxi-
dant protection markers—MDA, 8-OH-dG, CAT, SOD1, and GSH; (2) pro-inflammatory
cytokines—IL-6 and TNF-α, all measured in the supernatant of whole-liver homogenate.
All listed parameters were analyzed via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
method on an ELISA microplate reader (HumanReader, HUMAN, Wiesbaden, Germany)
using commercial kits [ELISA Kit for CAT, Cloud-Clone Corp., Katy, TX, USA, Cat.No.
SEC418Ra; MDA ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-0060; 8-OH-dG ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-0028;
SOD1 (Soluble) ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-R1424; GSH ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-0026;
Rat IL-6 ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-R0015; Rat TNF- α ELISA Kit, Cat.No. E-EL-R2856,
Elabscience Biotechnology Inc., Houston, TX, USA]. All assays were carried out using
ELISA kits from the same production lot in order to minimize batch-to-batch variabil-
ity, and internal controls supplied by the manufacturer were included on each plate to
ensure reproducibility.
4.3.3. Biochemical Markers in Serum
Whole blood was collected from the animals into VACUTEST KIMA tubes (Arzer-
grande, Italy) and left at room temperature until visible clot formation. The samples were
then centrifuged in an MPW-352R unit (MPW Med. Instruments, Warsaw, Poland) at
3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ◦C. The resulting serum was separated, aliquoted, and stored
at −80 ◦C (ULT C200) until analysis. It was used for spectrophotometric assessment of
the levels of the following markers for liver toxicity: AST (HUMAN Diagnostics GmbH,
Wiesbaden, Germany, Ref. No. 12021), ALT (HUMAN Diagnostics GmbH, Wiesbaden, Ger-
many, Ref. No. 12022), total bilirubin (HUMAN Diagnostics GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany,
Ref. No. 10746), and conjugated bilirubin. Biochemical measurements were performed on
an Evolution 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
following the protocols supplied with the commercial kits.
4.4. Statistical Analysis
Statistical processing of the data was performed with SPSS software, version 17.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences between group
means were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc
test. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05.
5. Conclusions
The present results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that pre-treatment with
methanolic extract of M. frivaldszkyana for 7 days results in significant hepatoprotective
effects in an APAP-induced rat model of liver injury. The mechanism of this effect could be
attributed to cell membrane protection, decreased lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, and
attenuation of aseptic inflammation. These effects can be attributed to the main compounds
identified in the extract (linarin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, eupatorin, apigenin, RA).
