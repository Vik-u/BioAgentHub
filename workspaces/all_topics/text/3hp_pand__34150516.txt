abstract
Biomass, the most abundant carbon source on the planet, may in the future become the primary feed-
stock for production of fuels and chemicals, replacing fossil feedstocks. This will, however, require de-
velopment of cell factories that can convert both C6 and C5 sugars present in lignocellulosic biomass into
the products of interest. We engineeredSaccharomyces cerevisiaefor production of 3-hydroxypropionic
acid (3HP), a potential building block for acrylates, from glucose and xylose. We introduced the 3HP
biosynthetic pathways via malonyl-CoA or
β-alanine intermediates into a xylose-consuming yeast. Using
controlled fed-batch cultivation, we obtained 7.3770.17 g 3HP L/C01 in 120 hours with an overall yield of
2971% Cmol 3HP Cmol/C01 xylose. This study is theﬁrst demonstration of the potential of usingS. cer-
evisiae for production of 3HP from the biomass sugar xylose.

1. Introduction
In order to maintain and improve our current living standard it
is necessary with a transition to a sustainable fossil-free society,
and this will require novel technologies for production of energy,
fuels and chemicals. In the absence of strong governmental and
regulatory support, the emerging bio-based technologies must
compete with the established petrochemical industry. Never-
theless during the last decade we have witnessed positive devel-
opments in the bio-based industry: appearance of theﬁrst com-
mercial-scale 2nd generation ethanol bioreﬁneries and of com-
mercial plants for bulk bio-based chemicals, such as lactic acid,
farnesene, isobutanol, 1,4-butadiene, etc. (seeBorodina and Niel-
sen (2014), Li and Borodina (2014)and Van Dien (2013) for re-
ferences and details). With increasing bio-based production it will
not be possible to solely use sugars from food crops as a feedstock,
and there is therefore a need for creating novel cell factories that
can produce chemicals from lignocellulosic materials, which con-
tain both pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6).
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is an attractive bio-based
platform chemical as it can be chemically converted into acrylic
acid, acrylic esters and amides, and hereby enables sustainable
production of superabsorbent polymers, plastics, paints, etc. The
market for acrylic acid and its esters is estimated to reach USD 18.8
billion by 2020 (“Acrylic Acid Market (Acrylate Esters, Glacial Ac-
rylic Acid & Others) for Superabsorbent polymers and Surface
Coatings, Adhesives and Sealants, Textiles, Plastic Additives and
Printing Ink Applications-Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share,
Growth and Forecast, 2012–2018,”). 3HP has been produced bio-
logically from glycerol by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia
coli strains, from glucose at neutral pH byE. coli (see Kumar et al.
(2013) for references and details), and lately also from glucose at
lower pH by yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae(Borodina et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2014a). As 3HP is an organic acid
with pKa of 4.51, running the fermentation at low pH reduces the
downstream process cost and amount of waste, and a yeast-based
process is therefore preferable. Furthermore, yeast has an ad-
vantage of being tolerant to inhibitors in biomass hydrolysate and
can be engineered for tolerant to high concentration of 3HP (Kil-
degaard et al., 2014). Here we explored the production of 3HP from
D-xylose by engineeredS. cerevisiae.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strains and chemicals
The xylose utilizing S. cerevisiae strain was described before
(Scalcinati et al., 2012). Recombinant yeast strains were selected
and maintained on synthetic drop-out agar without tryptophan
and with 2% xylose as the sole carbon source. Chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3HP was purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co. (TCI). Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was from
Agilent Technologies Inc.
2.2. Strain construction
The yeast strains and plasmids are listed inTable 1. The primers
and biobricks are listed inSupplementary Tables 1and 2, respec-
tively. The xylose-consuming CMB.GS010 strain was made auxo-
trophic for uracil, histidine and leucine as following. First, the ORF
of URA3 gene was replaced with the KanMX cassette using
homologous recombination. As theKanMX cassette is ﬂanked by
LoxP sites, theKanMX cassette was removed by Cre-LoxP-mediated
selection marker loop-out as described previously (Jensen et al.,
2014b). Next, the ORF ofLEU2 and HIS3 genes were replaced by the
URA3 from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlURA3) and KanMX cassettes,
respectively. Finally, the KlURA3 and KanMX cassettes were
looped-out using Cre-LoxP system to generate the ﬁnal strain
ST2488. The yeast transformations were performed using the li-
thium acetate protocol (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007). The elimination
of the selection markers was veriﬁed by PCR in addition to phe-
notypic test. To construct 3HP-producing strains, expression vec-
tors carrying the genes involved in 3HP biosynthesis were linear-
ized with NotI and then transformed into ST2488. The transfor-
mants were selected on synthetic drop-out xylose medium with-
out uracil, histidine, leucine and tryptophan.
2.3. Cultivation of yeast
For testing 3HP production, the strains were cultivated in mi-
neral medium with 20 g L
/C01 glucose or xylose as carbon-source in
96-deep well plate as described earlier (Borodina et al., 2015).
Controlled fermentations were carried out according to the
following protocol. Batch fermentations were performed in the
mineral media as previously described ( Verduyn et al., 1992)
containing 50 g L/C01 of xylose, 5 g L/C01 of (NH4)2SO4,3 g L/C01 of
KH2PO4, 0.5 g L/C01 of MgSO4 /C17H2O, 0.05 mL of antifoam, 1 mL of a
vitamin solution and 1 mL of a trace metal solution. The medium
used to prepare the pre-cultures in shake-ﬂasks was the same as
above with the following modiﬁcations: no antifoam, 7.5 g L/C01 of
(NH4)2SO4, 14.4 g L/C01 of KH2PO4 and the pH was adjusted to
6.5 with NaOH before autoclaving. Each fermenter was inoculated
with an initial OD600 of 0.5 using a pre-culture obtained by culti-
vating a single colony of the desired strain in 30 mL of mineral
medium in a 100 mL shake-ﬂask at 200 rpm in an orbital shaker
kept at 30°C. The batch and fed-batch fermentations were per-
formed in 2.7-L DASGIP Bioreactors (Dasgip, Jülich, Germany). The
working volume for batch fermentations was 1 L, the temperature
set-point was controlled at 30°C, the airﬂow was set at 1 vvm (gas
volume ﬂow per unit of liquid volume per minute), the pH was
maintained at 5 by feedback controlled addition of 10% NH4OH,
the dissolved oxygen was kept above 30% of saturation by feed-
back control of the stirring speed from 600 rpm until a maximum
of 1200 rpm. The concentration of O2 and CO2 in exhaust gas was
monitored by a DASGIPs GA4 exhaust analyzer. The fed-batch
cultures were initiated as batch cultures using 20 g L/C01 xylose. An
exponential feeding rate of xylose was designed to keep the
growth rate at 0.03 h/C01.
2.4. Analysis of biomass and metabolites
The growth was measured by optical density at 600 nm and cell
dry weight. Extracellular metabolites, such as 3HP, glucose, xylose,
ethanol, acetate, glycerol, and succinate, were analyzed by HPLC as
reported in (Borodina et al., 2015).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Engineering 3HP pathways into the xylose-consuming yeast
The xylose consuming yeast CMB.GS010 was constructed pre-
viously by transforming CEN.PK 113–3C with the centromeric
vector pRS314-X123 carrying xylose reductase (XR), xylitol dehy-
drogenase (XDH) and xylulokinase (XK) fromPichia stipitis under
control of strong constitutive promoter TDH3 and evolving the
resulting strain on mineral medium with xylose as the sole carbon
source (Scalcinati et al., 2012). The evolved strain had an increased

maximal speciﬁc growth rate compared with the non-evolved
parent strain, i.e. 0.18 h/C01 compared with 0.02 h/C01, and showed a
15-fold increase in the xylose consumption rate. As the CMB.GS010
strain has no selectable markers available for further genetic
modiﬁcations, three auxotrophic mutations ( ura3Δ, leu2Δ and
his3Δ) were made in strain CMB.GS010 to obtain strain ST2488.
In ST2488, we introduced two different pathways for 3HP
production, one via malonyl-CoA (P-I) and another viaβ-alanine
(P-II) (Jensen et al., 2014a; Borodina et al., 2015)( Fig. 1). The strain
with P-I (ST2546) carried overexpression cassettes for 5 genes:
malonyl-CoA reductase fromChloroﬂexus aurantiacus MCR, phos-
phorylation insensitive variant of acetyl-CoA carboxylase
ACC1S659A, S1157A (ACC1**), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD6), acetyl-
CoA synthase fromSalmonella enterica (SEACS), and pyruvate dec-
arboxylase (PDC1). MCR and ACC1** were integrated into TY4 ret-
rotransposon regions using degradation-tagged URA3 selection
marker as described in (Borodina et al., 2015) to ensure multiple
integration events. The pathway P-II either used a NADH-depen-
dent route (P-IIa) or a NADPH-dependent route (P-IIb). The strain
with P-IIa (ST2808) carried over-expression cassettes for 5 genes:
pyruvate carboxylase (PYC1, PYC2), β-alanine-pyruvate amino-
transferase from Bacillus cereus (BcBAPAT), aspartate 1-decarbox-
ylase from Triboleum castanium (TcPAND), and NADH-dependent
3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HIBADH) from Pseudomo-
nas putida (PpHIBADH). In the strain with P-IIb (ST2547) the last
gene was replaced by NADPH-dependent 3-hydroxypropionate
dehydrogenase (HPDH) from E. coli (EcYdfG). In the strains with
P-IIa and P-IIb pathways, all the genes were integrated into the
genome in a single copy, with exception ofTcPAND gene, which
was inserted into TY4 regions. Because the resulting transformants
may have different copy numbers of the vectors integrating into
different TY4 regions, we chose to screen 15 transformants of each
strain for 3HP production on glucose and xylose. The average titer
on glucose was highest for the strain with P-I (1.4470.14 g L/C01),
however this strain had a very poor 3HP production on xylose
(0.1770.11 g L/C01)( Fig. 2). The 3HP titers for the P-IIa strain were
comparable on glucose and xylose (0.60 70.03 and
0.4970.16 g L/C01) and the speciﬁc yield on xylose was nearly twice
as high as that on glucose. The best titer was obtained for strain
with P-IIb pathway, 1.00 70.06 g L/C01 on glucose and
1.8470.23 g L/C01 on xylose and the speciﬁc yield on xylose was
nearly 2.7-fold higher than that on glucose. We speculate that the
reason for low 3HP production from xylose via P-I is the lack of
overﬂow metabolism (Crabtree effect), where a large part of the
carbon is channeled via pyruvate decarboxylase into ethanol. As
was shown in a previous study (Borodina et al., 2015), 3HP accu-
mulation largely occurs during the ethanol consumption phase
during cultivation on glucose, however only very limited amounts

of ethanol are produced during growth on xylose. The absence of
the Crabtree effect had however a positive effect on the 3HP
production via the β-alanine pathway, which begins with the
anaplerotic reaction from pyruvate to oxaloacetate, and hence
competes for pyruvate with pyruvate decarboxylase.
3.2. Production of 3HP in controlled batch and fed-batch reactors
The best 3HP-producing strains ST2547 and ST2808 were fer-
mented in batch mode on mineral medium with xylose as the sole
carbon source (Fig. 3). The pH was maintained at 5 during the
fermentation. In batch mode about 50 g L/C01 of xylose was con-
sumed in 140 hours, resulting in 6.0970.33 g L/C01 3HP by ST2547,
compared with 2.3 70.09 g L/C01 3HP by ST2808. Ethanol con-
centration did not exceed 1 g L/C01 at any point of fermentation.
ST2547 strain was further characterized in fed-batch mode. In fed-
batch mode after 120 hours of fermentation, the 3HP concentra-
tion reached 7.3770.17 g L
/C01, with an overall yield of 2971%
C-mol 3HP C-mol/C01 xylose. As xylose does not elicit the Crabtree
effect, the batch or fed-batch mode of sugar addition did not have
a signiﬁcant impact on theﬁnal titer or yield.
4. Conclusions
3HP production via two different pathways has been estab-
lished in the evolved xylose-utilizing yeast, where the 3HP path-
way viaβ-alanine resulted in higher product titer on xylose than
the pathway via malonyl-CoA. The study lays the basis for devel-
opment of the yeast strain for producing 3HP from lignocellulosic
feedstocks at low pH.
