ABSTRACT Marinobacter nanhaiticus  D15-8W is known for its ability to metabolize 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Here, we report the complete circular genome 
sequence of this strain to be 5,336,660 bp (G + C content, 58.6%; 4,869 protein-coding 
sequences) with one plasmid (69,655 bp).
KEYWORDS Marinobacter, halophile, PETase, bioremediation
M
arinobacter nanhaiticus  D15-8W is a slightly halophilic bacilliform Gram-negative 
bacteria that is facultatively anaerobic and was previously isolated from a South 
China Sea sediment (1). The ability of some Marinobacter strains, including M. nanhaiticus 
D15-8W, to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been a major focus of past 
research ( 1–5). In addition, M. nanhaiticus  D15-8W is currently one of the few known 
marine bacteria to harbor a gene with the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephtha­
late) (PET), characterized as PETase type IIa ( 6). The draft genome sequence of this strain, 
consisting of 14 contigs, was published previously ( 7), but here we report the complete 
circular genome for this strain.
M. nanhaiticus  D15-8W strain was purchased from the Korean Collection for Type 
Cultures as KCTC 23749 T. After streaking on Marine Agar 2216, a single colony was 
cultured overnight in Marine Broth 2216 (product no. 76448, MilliporeSigma; 30°C, with 
shaking at 200 rpm) and harvested at an OD 600 of around 0.3. The genomic DNA 
was extracted using the Genomic-tip 20/G system (Qiagen). A genomic DNA library 
for sequencing was prepared and multiplexed using the rapid barcoding kit (product 
no. SQK-RBK004, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The library was sequenced with 
FLO-MIN111 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) on a GridION X5 device (GridION 
software version 21.10.5, Oxford Nanopore Technologies), base-called, demultiplexed, 
and adapter-trimmed by guppy version 6.3.8 (Super-Accurate Mode). Illumina sequenc­
ing was performed for error correction using the HyperPlus library preparation kit (Kapa 
Biosystems) and a MiSeq sequencer with Reagent Kit v3 600 cycles as 300 bp paired 
ends (Illumina). All nanopore reads (31,320 reads, 126 Mbp, N50 length 7.5 kbp) were 
used for the de novo  assembly using Canu version 2.2 ( 8). The resulting single contigs 
of a chromosome and a plasmid were circularized by manually deleting the overlapping 
ends. An improved consensus sequence was obtained by correcting the draft assembly 
with all raw Illumina reads (8.6M pairs) using the Pilon software version 1.23 ( 9). The 
resulting genome sequence was functionally annotated using DFAST version 1.2.18 ( 10). 
The assembled genome consists of one circular chromosome of 5,336,660 bp with 
58.6% G + C content, including 4,869 coding sequences (CDSs), 52 tRNAs, and 9 rRNAs. 
Moreover, one plasmid was found (length, 69,655 bp; G + C content, 54.3%; CDSs, 80), 
on which oriTfinder detected nine essential genes from the type IV secretion system ( 11). 
Default parameters were used except where otherwise noted.

The assembly completeness was assessed with CheckM (DFAST), resulting in 99.61% 
completeness with the Alteromonadaceae marker lineage ( 12), which was equivalent to 
the previously published draft assembly ( 7). We confirmed that the newly sequenced 
genome contains the gene for PETase type IIa, as reported previously, by BLASTP search 
of UniProt A0A0K8P6T7 PETase (e = 3e−75) (6). The complete genome reported here may 
contribute to understanding how M. nanhaiticus D15-8W decomposes organic pollutants 
in marine environments.
