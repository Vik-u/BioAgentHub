Introduction
The amount of biocatalytic applicationsi nt he chemical indus-
try is constantly increasing as the many benefits of enzymes
compared to other catalysts are recognized.[1] Enzymesh ave
been optimized by evolutiont op erform very specific tasks in
nature and therefore often catalyze reactions with high activity
and selectivity (chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity). These are
important characteristicso fa ni ndustrial catalyst and modern
techniques have now made it straightforward to engineer
these naturally evolvedc atalysts into tailor-made enzymes for
any unnatural reaction of choice.[2]
However,s ince enzymes are evolved by nature in natural
conditions, which often consist of neutral pH and moderate
temperatures, their stabilityi ni ndustrial settings can be limit-
ed.[3] Methods to improve enzyme stability include protein en-
gineering (directed evolution, rational design or combinations
thereof), immobilization and mediume ngineering.[4] Directed
evolution is aN obel prize-awarded commonly applieds trategy
to create new robust biocatalysts that can withstand the harsh
conditions of an industrial process.[5] It is an attractive option
as it does not require any knowledge about the enzyme, but
even thought he efficiency of the method is constantly increas-
ing, it can still be at ime- and resource-consuming process due
to extensive librarys creening and data analysis. Methods for
stabilityi mprovement based on rational design are of great
interest, asi tw ould requirel ess work and resources as only
small amounts of variants are created. Protein engineering
methodsb ased on rational design require structurali nforma-
tion of the enzyme to be available. The need for structural
information is howeverb ecoming less of an issue, since the
number of published crystal structures is constantly increasing
in parallel with advances in homology and molecular model-
ing.
Rational design approaches for improvement of enzymes ta-
bility are often focused on introducing amino acid interactions
that promote enzyme rigidity,s uch as covalentd isulfide bonds
betweenc ysteine residues,i onic salt-bridges or hydrophobic
interactions.[6] These mutations are hard to predict and require
trial and error,w hich leads to difficulties in developing ag ener-
al strategy.A na lternative approachi st he previously formulat-
ed “Proliner ule”, which states that introduction of proline resi-
dues in certain positions in ap rotein leads to general stabiliza-
tion.[7] The unique structure of proline, where the side-chain is
Biocatalysis is attracting interesti nt he chemical industry as a
sustainable alternativei nl arge-scale chemical transformations.
However,l ow operational stability of naturallye volvede n-
zymes is ac hallenge and major efforts are required to engineer
protein stability,u sually by directed evolution. The develop-
ment of methods for protein stabilization based on rational
design is of great interest, as it would minimize the efforts
neededt og enerates table enzymes. Here we present ar ation-
al design strategy based on proline substitutions in flexible
areas of the protein identified by analyzing B-factors. Several
proline substitutions in the amine transaminase from Chromo-
bacterium violaceum were shown to have ap ositive impact on
stabilityw ith increased half-life at 60 8Cb yaf actor of 2.7
(variantK 69P/D218P/K304P/R432P) as well as increased melt-
ing temperature by 8.3 8C( variant K167P). Finally,t he present-
ed methodu tilizing B-factor analysisi nc ombination with the
proline rule was deemed successful at increasingt he stability
of this enzyme.

covalently bound to the backbone amide nitrogen makes the
role of prolinei np rotein folding especially interesting. The
structureo fp roline gives rise to two specific features in the
protein. Firstly,t he covalent bond to the amide nitrogen
means that this nitrogen cannot take parti nh ydrogen bond-
ing and secondly,t he five-membered ring of proline makest he
bond between the a-carbon( Ca)a nd the backbone nitrogen
more rigid and less prone to rotation.[8] Early work on oligo-
1,6-glucosidases showedt hat proline content in enzymes from
thermophilic organisms is generally higher than in mesophilic
organisms.[9] This observation then led to an early version of
the Proline rule stating that mutagenesis of the second posi-
tion (i++1) in b-turns increasesp rotein stability.[7a] Thet heory
was later experimentally confirmed and it was shown that
these mutationsw ere indeed effective and cumulative.[10] It
was also shown that prolines ubstitutions in the N-terminal
caps of a-helices had as imilare ffect. This finally led to what is
known as the Proline rule. It states that proline substitutions
in:1 )t he i++1p ositiono f b-turns,a nd 2) the N1 position of a-
helices generally increases thermostability.[7b] Proline, which is
generallyd efined as a“ helix-breaker”, has actually been shown
to have ar ather high occurrence in the N1 position of a-heli-
ces.[11] The Proline rule has been appliedw ithv arying success
in several cases with the goal of increasing protein stability.[12]
Amine transaminases[13] (ATAs) have gained increased indus-
trial attention duet ot heir ability to catalyzea symmetric trans-
amination of ketones with excellent enantioselectivity and
yield.[14] Wild-type ATAs are however rarely stable enough for
industrial applications and improvement of stabilityi st here-
fore required.[15] Here, the bacterial amine transaminase from
Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ATA)w as applieda sa model
enzymet oe valuatet he Proline rule as as trategy for enzyme
stabilization. The stabilityo f Cv-ATA has previously been im-
provedt hrough immobilization[16] and mediume ngineer-
ing.[15, 17] Here we presenta method for improvement of the
stabilityo f Cv-ATA using B-factor analysis in combinationw ith
the Proline rule. B-factors describe atom fluctuation caused by
thermalm otion.[18] B-factord ata are generally available in X-ray
crystal structures of proteins and can be used to localize flexi-
ble regions that can be stabilized. The Proline rule was applied
to stabilize some flexible regions in Cv-ATA and all mutations
were analyzed with regards to meltingp oint (Tm), inactivation
temperature (T50)a nd half-life values (t1/2). Molecular dynamics
simulations have also been performed in order to understand
the individual mutation’s impact on stability. The combined
results of this study wereu sed to evaluate the potentialo f
B-factorg uided proline substitution as as trategy for protein
stabilization.
Results and Discussion
Flexibler egions in Cv-ATA were identified by accessing B-fac-
tors of all a-carbons (Ca)f rom ap reviously published crystal
structure of holo Cv-ATA (PDB ID:4 A6T).[19] This crystal struc-
ture contains four subunits. Therefore, am ean value of the
four available Ca B-factors for each residue was calculated and
plotteda gainst residue number (Figure 1). Peaks in the B-
factor plot were deemed as flexible regions and the relative
degree of flexibility was assessed by difference in peak height.
This approachh as previously been successfully appliedt oa n
R-selective amine transaminase from Aspergillus terreus in order
to identify positions important for improving stability.[20]
The protein structure was divided intos econdary structure
elements of interest( a-helices and b-turns;T able S1 in the
Supporting Information). In accordance with the Proline rule,
most of the peaks in the B-factor plot belonged to a-helices
and b-turns. Seven surface-exposed secondary-structure ele-
ments (Figure S1) were selected for prolines ubstitution based
on their elevated B-factors in relation to nearbyr esidues
(Table 1, Figure 1). In addition, the C-terminal a-helix 16 was
also included to see if it could be stabilized. It is al ong a-helix
in which the residuec hosen for mutation has al ow B-factor,
but the end of the a-helix is very flexible. Peaks that were dis-
carded either belonged to loops or already contained prolines
in the appropriate (or adjacent to the appropriate) positions.
Some peaks were also discarded in order to keep down
sample size.

Initially,t he eight selected prolinem utations (Table 1) were
combined into one eight-point mutant designated as Pro8.
However,t his variant generated an inactive( Table 2, based on
spectrophotometric analysisu sing the acetophenone assay[21])
and mostly insoluble (FigureS 2) protein product. The eight
substitutions of Pro8 were therefore divided into four double
mutations( K69P/K304P, K167P/E368P,K 193P/G398P and
D218P/R432P) to find out which proline substitutions were
responsible for the inactivationo ft he protein. Three of these
variants were produced as soluble and activep roteins (Table 2,
Figure S3) with specific activities in the same range as wild
type (WT) that has as pecifica ctivity of 4.05 Um g@1 (1 unit is
hereby defined as 1 mmol of formed product per min), while
K193P/G398P remained insoluble (Figure S3) and inactive
(Table 2).
Twos ingle-point variants,K 193P andG 398P,w ere then gen-
erated. Variant G398P was shown to be inactive (Table 2) and it
was therefore concluded that G398P was the mutation causing
the insolubility.T oe xplore the amino acid position3 98 further,
the amino acid sequence of Cv-ATA was aligned with the 500
most similar sequences in the IMG database.[22] The negative
effect of the G398P substitution can most likely be explained
by the high conservation of glycine (97 %) in that position
(Table S2). In addition, when lookingb ack at the residue G398,
it was realized that it might actually not be in the N1 position
of the a-helix. It is more likely that the N1 position is occupied
by E399.
With the detrimental mutation G398P removed, as even-
point variant, denoted Pro7, wasc reated. The Pro7 variant was
soluble and active (Table 2, Figure S4) with as imilars pecific
activity as WT.H owever,i ts howed no significant improvement
regarding stability compared to the WT enzyme( data not
shown). This prompted us to generate all seven single-point
mutantsi no rder to investigate each substitution’se ffect on
stability. Initially, stabilityo ft he single-point mutantsw as in-
vestigated by measuringr esidual activity over time at two dif-
ferentt emperatures (37 and 60 8C; Figure 2). Significant stabili-
ty improvemento fs everalv ariants was shown at 37 8C. After
approximatelys even days, K69P, K304P,E 368P and R432P re-
tained 11–31 %r esidual activity,w hile the WT enzyme retained
only 7% activity (Figure 2A ). At 60 8C( Figure 2B ), three
variants (D218P,K 304P and R432P) performed better than WT
while two variants (K69P and K167P) showed ad ecrease in sta-
bility.H owever,v ariant K69P showeda ni nteresting pattern at
60 8Cw here it initially was more stable than WT.H owever,a fter
aw hile the rate of inactivation increased and at the end-point,
residual activity of K69P was lower than the WT.

To further investigate stabilityo ft he variants, T50 and t1/2
values were determined for WT and all variants (Table 3,
Figure S5). The values show consistency with the previouse x-
periment as variants D218P,K 304P,E 368P andR 432P all show
increased T50 and t1/2 while K167P has af ive times lower t1/2 at
60 8Cc ompared to the WT.
The Michaelis–Menten kinetics was also investigated for WT
and all variants at 25 8C. The WT enzymeh as a Kapp
M of 7.60 mm
for (S)-1-phenylethylamine and a vapp
max of 8.18 Um g@1 (Table 2).
The kinetic constants and specific activity for all variants
(exceptf or the inactive ones) display no significant changes
and it can therefore be concluded that the mutationsd on ot
have an impact on catalysis.
Since it was previously shown that proline substitutions fol-
lowingt he Proliner ule are cumulative,[10] the previously creat-
ed double mutantsw ere also investigated in order to see any
possible cumulative effects of these mutations. It is however
not straightforward identifying ac umulative pattern within the
double-mutants. The T50 values show ac umulative pattern
while the t1/2 valuesd on ot (Table3 ). It is therefore not possible
to draw any conclusions about any cumulative effects based
on thesed oublem utants. In order to further investigatet his,
all the bests ingle-point mutants from the stabilityo ver time
experiments at differentt emperatures (Figure 2) were incorpo-
rated into one five-point mutant designated as Pro5 (K69P/
D218P/K304P/E368P/R432P). The four-point mutant Pro4
(K69P/D218P/K304P/R432P) was generated in the process of
making Pro5 and was therefore included in the subsequent
experiments. As shown in Table 3, Pro4 and Pro5 are among
the bestp erforming variants with regards to T50 and t1/2.T he
effects of the mutations are however not cumulative since T50
and t1/2 of Pro5 are almost identicalt ot he double mutant
D218P/R432P.T hese two mutations are both in Pro5 and if the
effects of the mutationsw ere cumulative, ap ositive contribu-
tion from the other mutations would also be seen.
Thermal unfolding of the variants was investigated by differ-
ential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)[23] where protein unfolding
can be monitored over time as temperature is increasing.T he
Tm was determined and large improvements couldb es een for
K167P,K 193P and R432P.T he highest DTm at 8.3 8Cw as shown
for K167P (Table 3). The other single-point mutations showed
no significant change in Tm value, except for K69P forw hich
the Tm value dropped by 2.4 8C. The double mutant K167P/
E368P has the highest increasei n Tm (8.9 8C) out of all variants
while the other combined mutationss how no significant
change except for Pro7 that, interestingly,h as a DTm of @1.8 8C
(Table 3). The Tm values do not display ac umulative pattern
and while some mutationss eem to be deleterious, they are
not so in every case.
It can be seen that many variants showing an increased Tm
do not display an increased T50 or t1/2 (Table 3). This can be
explained by the fact that Tm is related to thermodynamic
(conformational) stability while T50 and t1/2 are relatedt ok inetic
(long-term) stability.[3,24] These two are relatedt od ifferent pro-
cesses of inactivationa nd am utation showing an effect on
one cannot be expectedt os how an effect on the other.
An unfolding profile was obtained by measuring increase in
fluorescenceo ver time at 70 8C( Figure 3). These results corre-
late well to the Tm results, as the variants with improved Tm un-
folded slower than the WT.
To investigate andv isualize the individual effects of the mu-
tations on the stability of the protein, molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations werep erformed on single-point mutants
with improved T50 and t1/2.T he double mutant D218P/R432P
and Pro5 was also included in the MD simulation. By monitor-
ing the mobility of each atom duringt he course of aM Ds imu-
lation, protein flexibility over time can be analyzed. This is im-

portant since highly flexible residues can trigger protein un-
folding due to their large fluctuations.[25] The MD simulations
were carriedo ut at 95 8Co ver the course of 10 ns. The elevat-
ed temperature was chosen in order to be able to observe an
effect on protein motion within as horter time. Snapshots were
saved every 0.25 ns and weres ubsequently aligned against the
startings tructure for analysis of RMSD values. The results of
the MD simulations are presented as total RMSD of the protein
over the duration of simulation (Figure 4) as well as mean
RMSD/residue (Figure 5). As can be seen in Figure S6, it takes
approximately 2n sf or the structure to equilibrate during the
MD simulation and the RMSD/residue is therefore calculated in
the period of 2–10 ns. The total RMSD over time is shown both
for Ca (Figure 4A )a nd for all atoms (Figure S6). For all atoms, a
differenceb etween the variants cannotb es een. Thisi sn ot
surprising since this includes the RMSD for all sidechains, in-
cluding mobile surface exposed residues, and we assumet hat
ac lear difference in this graph would indicate ad rastic im-
provement in protein stability.H owever,w hen RMSD for only
the Ca atoms is calculated, ac lear differenceb etween the var-
iants can be seen. By excluding the first time point, al inear
regression could be performed (Figure 4B )a nd herei tc an be
seen that the WT reaches ah igherR MSD in the beginning of
the MD simulation compared to the variants. Interestingly,t wo
variants( E368P and Pro5) initially have as lower increasei n
RMSD but after 10 ns they are at the same level as the WT.V ar-
iants K304P,R 432P and D218P/R432P all have as lower initial
increaseo fR MSD but the increase during the linear phase is
lower as well, indicating ad ecreased backbonef lexibility in
these variants. The only variant showing higherR MSD than the
WT is D218P that has as imilari nitial increase as WT but the

linear phaseh as ah igher increase.W hen lookinga tm ean
RMSD/residue (Figure 5), stabilitye ffects on single amino acids
or separates econdary structure elements can be visualized.
The results show that large parts of the protein retain as imilar
flexibility before and after mutation.O bvious deviations from
this observation are fore xample, D218P where al arge unsus-
pected peak arises in the area of residues 24–30. This area cor-
responds to as hort surface exposed a-helix that is in no way
close to residue 218. The same variant shows as lightly in-
creasedf lexibility in the area of residues 90–110 which is again
an area that is not near the mutation.H owever,i ti sn ext to
the previously mentioned area and the increasedf lexibility can
possibly be explained by this. Another outlier is the peak
aroundr esidue 173 in Pro5. This peak is relatively close to the
a-helix that should be affected by the K304P mutation and a
small increasei nf lexibility is observed in the same area when
lookinga tt he single-point mutantK 304P.A ll variants,i nclud-
ing the WT,h as ap eak of similar height at position3 16 except
for the double mutantD 218P/R432P that seemst od isplay a
drastic decrease at this position. Also in this case, the peak is
not near the mutations. One area of interest is the C-terminal
a-helix that in theory should be stabilized by the mutation
R432P in the beginningo ft he helix. The WT shows the highest
flexibility in this area indicating that all mutationsp artly stabi-
lize this a-helix and interestingly,t he two most rigid variants in
this area both include the mutation R432P (R432P and D218P/
R432P). Concluding this experiment, one can see that most
mutations do not show an immediate effect on flexibility at
the point of mutation (except for R432P). There are however
distante ffects of many mutations that are difficultt oe xplain
and this further highlightst he challenge of improving stability
in proteins by rational design.
Conclusions
The stability of Cv-ATA has been successfully improvedb ye m-
ploying a B-factor guided proline substitution strategy.F lexible
regions were identified by analyzing B-factors from the Cv-ATA
crystal structurea nd the Proline rule was thereafter used to
predict prolines ubstitutions that in theoryw ould stabilize said
regions.S uccessful variants include af our-point mutant( Pro4)
and ad ouble mutant (D218P/R432P) that increased the half-
life at 60 8Cb ya factor of 2.7 and 2.2, respectively.S ome pro-
line substitutions were also shown to drastically increase the
meltingp oint (Tm)w ith the most successful single-point variant
increasing Tm with 8.3 8C( K167P). Molecular dynamics simula-
tions were also performed in order to understand the effects
of the mutationso np rotein flexibility.C lear differences could
be seen when comparing variants, but mostly in regionst hat
were not close to the mutated residues.
Finally,t he presented B-factor guided prolines ubstitution
strategyw as shown to be an effective methodf or improving

Experimental Section
Materials: All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and
used without further purification. The Ni-NTAS epharose resin used
for His-trap purification was purchased from IBA (Sweden). PD10
desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Science
(Sweden).
Enzyme cloning and generation of enzyme variants: The C. viola-
ceum amine transaminase gene (GenBank accession WP_
011135573) was previously inserted into pET28a(++)w ith aN -termi-
nal His6 tag.[26] The plasmid sequence was verified (Eurofins MWG
Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) before transformation into Escheri-
chia coli BL21(DE3). The enzyme variant Pro8 was synthesized,
codon optimized and cloned into pET28a(++)u sing restriction sites
NcoI and BamHI by GenScript. The rest of the enzyme variants
were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed muta-
genesis was performed by the Quick Change method with modifi-
cations according to Zheng et al.,[27] by using Phusion High-Fidelity
DNA Polymerase from Thermo Fisher.A lternatively,s ite-directed
mutagenesis using the MEGAWHOP[28] strategy was performed to
obtain the double mutants. The primers used in this work are
listed below,w ith the mutations indicated in lower case:

Enzyme expression and purification: One BL21(DE3) E. coli
colony,c ontaining WT Cv-ATA or variants in pET28a(++)w as incu-
bated in lysogeny broth (5 mL) at 37 8Ca nd 200 rpm, overnight.
The overnight culture was used to inoculate terrific broth (TB
400 mL) medium. The culture was further incubated at 200 rpm
and 37 8C. At OD600 0.7–0.9, isopropyl b-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG, 1m m)w as added and the temperature was decreased to
20 8C. Both media were supplemented with 50 mg L@1 kanamycin.
After 16 ho fi nduction, cells were harvested by centrifugation
(Beckman coulter Avanti J-26XP) at 11500 g for 30 min at 4 8C. The
collected cell pellet was resuspended in binding buffer for disrup-
tion by sonication (6 min;B ranson Sonifier 250) at 30 duty cycles %
and with a5 –6 Microtip limit. After 30 min of centrifugation at
3500 g and 4 8C, the supernatant was collected and filtered
(0.45 mm). Purification was performed on aN i-NTAH is-trap column,
according to the IBA manufacturer’sm anual with binding buffer

elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4,3 00 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole,
pH 8.2).
Samples were buffer exchanged to HEPES buffer (50 mm,p H8 .2)
with 5m m pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) in the supernatant by
using aP D10 desalting column. The samples were incubated at
4 8C, overnight, followed by 1h at 37 8Ct he next day to obtain
re-binding PLP to the enzyme. Additional desalting with aP D10
column was performed to remove the unbound PLP.
Enzyme activity assay and determination of kinetic parameters:
The acetophenone assay[21] was performed at 25 8Ct oa ssay
enzyme activity.T he reaction mixture (1 mL) generally composed
of 10 mgo fe nzyme, (S)-1-phenylethylamine (2.5 mm)a nd pyruvate
(2.5 mm)i n5 0m m HEPES pH 8.2. The formation of acetophenone
was monitored at 245 nm on aC ary50 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
In order to obtain the kinetic parameters, the same model reaction
was performed in microplates with af inal volume of 100 mLa nd
1 mgo fe nzyme. In this case, acetophenone production was moni-
tored on aF LUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). To obtain
the Michaelis–Menten constant (Kapp
M ), six different concentrations
of (S)-1-phenylethylamine, ranging from 0.1 to 15 mm,w ere used.
Each test was carried out with at least three replicates. The Kapp
M
and vapp
max values were calculated by nonlinear regression using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.,L aJ olla, CA, USA).
Enzyme stability measurement:t emperature of half inactiva-
tion: Residual activity of Cv-ATA WT and variants incubated at dif-
ferent temperatures was evaluated in order to obtain the tempera-
ture of half inactivation (T50). For this, 0.5 mg mL@1 of enzyme solu-
tion in HEPES (50 mm,p H8 .2) was incubated from 50 to 80 8Ci n
5 8Ci ntervals, and after 15 min, the activity assay was performed.
All measurements were performed in duplicate. To calculate T50,
the obtained data was fitted to the Boltzmann equation in Graph-
Pad Prism 6.0.
Enzyme stability measurement:h alf-life of thermal inactivation:
To obtain the half-life of thermal inactivation (t1/2), 0.5 mgmL@1 of
Cv-ATA WT and variants in HEPES (50 mm,p H8 .2) were incubated
at 60 8Cf or different time intervals, and the activity assay was ap-
plied to obtain the residual activity values. All measurements were
performed in duplicates. To calculate t1/2,t he obtained data were
fitted to the one-phase decay equation in GraphPad Prism 6.0.
Enzyme stability measurement:M elting temperature measure-
ments: Melting temperature (Tm)v alues were measured using dif-
ferential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).[23] The measurement was per-
formed on aC FX96 real-time PCR detection system and C1000
thermal cycler at 569 nm. The reaction sample (20 mL) consisted of
0.5 mg mL@1 enzyme and 3.75 VSYPRO Orange protein gel stain
(Sigma Aldrich, S5692) in HEPES (50 mm,p H8 .2). The temperature
range was set to 25–95 8C, with an increase of 1 8Cm in@1.E very
measurement was performed in duplicate. The Tm value was deter-
mined by fitting the original data to the Boltzmann equation in
GraphPad Prism 6.0.
Enzyme stability measurement:t emperature-induced enzyme
unfolding: SYPRO Orange dye was used to monitor enzyme un-
folding at 70 8C. AC FX96 real-time PCR detection system and
C1000 thermal cycler were utilized to record fluorescence emission
at 569 nm every 5s at 70 8C. The reaction mixture (20 mL), consist-
ed of enzyme (0.5 mg mL@1)a nd SYPRO Orange dye (3.75V)i n
HEPES buffer (50 mm,p H8 .2). Every measurement was performed
in duplicate.
Bioinformatics: In order to identify similar proteins to Cv-ATA (WP_
011135573), aB LASTp search against the Integrated Microbial Ge-
nomes (IMG) database[22] of genome sequences was performed. A
total number of 500 proteins were identified with an E-value lower
than 1e@10, and those were selected for sequence alignment
using Clustal Omega to determine residue conservation.
Molecular dynamics simulation: MD simulations were performed
using YASARA[29] structure version 18.3.23. The 3D structure of Cv-
ATAW T( PDB ID:4 A6T) was obtained from the PDB database[30]
and prepared for modeling by deleting one of the dimers and
adding all missing hydrogens. The simulations were performed
inside aw ater-filled simulation cell (cuboid shape, 20 a around all
atoms) with periodic boundaries at pH 8.2. An energy minimization
was performed using the AMBER14 force field.[31] The energy-mini-
mized structure was subjected to aM Ds imulation at 338 Ku sing a
water density of 0.981 gm L@1.T he simulation duration was 10 ns
and snapshots were saved every 0.25 ns.
