ABSTRACT: Thermophilic polyester hydrolases (PES-H) have
recently enabled biocatalytic recycling of the mass-produced
synthetic polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which has
found widespread use in the packaging and textile industries. The
growing demand for efficient PET hydrolases prompted us to solve
high-resolution crystal structures of two metagenome-derived
enzymes (PES-H1 and PES-H2) and notably also in complex
with various PET substrate analogues. Structural analyses and
computational modeling using molecular dynamics simulations
provided an understanding of how product inhibition and multiple
substrate binding modes influence key mechanistic steps of
enzymatic PET hydrolysis. Key residues involved in substrate-
binding and those identified previously as mutational hotspots in
homologous enzymes were subjected to mutagenesis. At 72 °C, the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 exhibited 2.3-fold and 3.4-fold
improved hydrolytic activity against amorphous PET films and pretreated real-world PET waste, respectively. The R204C/S250C
variant of PES-H1 had a 6.4 °C higher melting temperature than the wild-type enzyme but retained similar hydrolytic activity. Under
optimal reaction conditions, the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 hydrolyzed low-crystallinity PET materials 2.2-fold more efficiently
than LCC ICCG, which was previously the most active PET hydrolase reported in the literature. This property makes the L92F/
Q94Y variant of PES-H1 a good candidate for future applications in industrial plastic recycling processes.

INTRODUCTION
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most abundant
synthetic polyester, is widely used in the packaging and textile
industries. The global production of PET recently reached 82
million metric tons per year.
1
This contributes significantly to
the global solid waste stream and environmental plastic
pollution. Biocatalytic recycling of PET has emerged as a
promising technology that allows the recovery of monomeric
building blocks at both laboratory and pilot plant scales.
2−5
Although PET hydrolases from a wide range of micro-
organisms have been identified, only a handful of benchmark
enzymes have been extensively engineered for industrial
applications.
6
As an interfacial biocatalytic reaction, the efficiency of PET
degradation is limited by the number of accessible ester bonds
at the polymer surface. Amorphous PET polymer chains
become more accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis at temper-
atures approaching the glass transition temperature of PET
(T
g
, 65−71 °C).
6
In aqueous environments, water serves as a
plasticizer that lowers the T
g
of PET by up to 16 °C.
6−8
This
effect increases the flexibility of polymer chains at the PET
surface layer, allowing degradation at ambient temperatures by
mesophilic PET hydrolases, like IsPETase from Ideonella
sakaiensis, which have optimal operating temperatures (T
opt
) of
approximately 40 °C.
9
Nonetheless, thermophilic and thermo-
stable PET hydrolases have superior degradation activity
because of increased substrate accessibility at elevated
temperatures.
10−12
LCC, a cutinase isolated from a leaf-branch compost
metagenome library, is one of the most extensively investigated
thermophilic PET hydrolases.
13−15
Structure-based protein
engineering of LCC has resulted in an F243I/D238C/S283C/

Y127G variant (LCC ICCG) that can efficiently depolymerize
pretreated postconsumer PET bottles within 10 h at 72 °C.
This enables the biocatalytic recycling of PET waste at
industrially relevant scales.
5
Calcium ions (Ca
2+
) can boost the
thermostability of many bacterial PET hydrolases (changes in
T
m
(ΔT
m
) = 10−16 °C and ΔT
opt
≥ 10 °C).
13,16−18
Engineering of residues in the Ca
2+
binding sites has proven
to be a useful approach for increasing the T
m
of several PET
hydrolases by up to 26 °C.
5,11,17,19−22
Introduction of a
disulfide bridge at this site (D238C/S283C) markedly
increased the melting point (T
m
) of LCC from 84.7 to 94.5
°C. In a recent study, LCC ICCG was further engineered to
obtain an A59K/V63I/N248P variant with a T
m
of 98.9 °C.
23
Nonetheless, the T
opt
of this variant for degrading low-
crystallinity PET (lcPET, <15% crystallinity) was 74 °C, only 2
°C higher than that for the precursor LCC ICCG.
5
At reaction
temperatures above 70 °C, water-plasticized lcPET rapidly
crystallizes to high-crystallinity PET (hcPET), which is much
harder to hydrolyze.
6,24,25
The 20% crystallinity threshold for
enzymatic hydrolysis can be reached within 3 h at 75 °C.
5
This
competitive physical aging process of amorphous polymers can
therefore considerably reduce the efficiency of enzymatic PET
depolymerization, which limits the maximum extent of
degradation that can be achieved.
25
Therefore, biocatalysts
with T
opt
in the range 72−74 °C, rather than with extremely
high T
m
values, are desired.
6
The mesophilic IsPETase (T
m
of
48.7 °C) has also been subjected to protein engineering to
improve its thermostability. For example, Cui et al. used a
computational strategy to design DuraPETase, a variant with a
31 °C higher T
m
and considerably improved PET hydrolysis
activity than the wild-type enzyme.
26
More recently, a
machine-learning-aided approach was used to engineer
IsPETase to produce Fast-PETase, a variant with a T
m
of
67.1 °C and increased depolymerization efficiency.
27
In-depth understanding of the binding mechanisms and
noncovalent interactions of insoluble polymeric substrates with
biocatalysts can contribute to the design of more efficient PET
hydrolases. So far, only two studies have reported structures of
crystals soaked with PET analogues. Han et al. reported a
structure of the inactive R103G/S131A IsPETase mutant
complexed with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate
(HEMT).
28
Zeng et al. reported the structure of an inactive
S165A mutant of LCC ICCG complexed with mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET).
23
Consequently, more
structures of PET hydrolases with bound substrate analogues
are needed. This would enable more precise computational
simulations for elucidating the mechanisms of enzymatic
depolymerization and predicting more efficient mutants. So far,
studies mostly relied on computationally modeled PET
substrate conformations.
15,29−32
Therefore, we solved crystal
structures of two PET hydrolases in complex with PET
analogues.
Two highly similar thermophilic PET hydrolases (PES-H1
and PES-H2), derived from a compost metagenome library,
were recently disclosed in a patent application.
33
PES-H1
demonstrated exceptional hydrolytic activity on amorphous
PET films, outperforming wild-type LCC under identical
conditions.
13,15
Nearly complete depolymerization was
achieved after incubation at 70 °C for 24 h.
33
We first solved
high-resolution structures of both enzymes in their apo form
(PDB codes: 7CUV for PES-H1 and 7W69 for PES-H1).
While this work was in progress, another crystal structure of
PES-H1 (called PHL7 in the publication, PDB code: 7NEI)
was solved.
34
By soaking with various PET substrate analogues,
structures of both PES-H1 and PES-H2 in complex with these
ligands were obtained by us. These structures were used for
exploring substrate binding modes by molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Finally, we generated PES-H1 variants with
significantly improved activity on both amorphous Goodfellow
PET (Gf-PET) films and pretreated postconsumer (‘real-
world’) PET waste. These variants outperformed both the
wild-type PES-H1 and LCC ICCG.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structures of PES-H1 and PES-H2. The crystal structures
of PES-H1 and PES-H2 were solved at atomic resolutions of
1.45 Å (PDB code: 7CUV) and 1.56 Å (PDB code: 7W69), in
the space groups P2
1
and C2, respectively (Figure S1; Tables
S1 and S2). PES-H1 and PES-H2 differ in only four residues
(A/E1, L/F209, D/N232, and S/A254), of which only the L/
F209 residues are in close vicinity to the catalytic triad (Figure
1). The two hydrolases have similar structures that adopt the
canonical α/β-hydrolase fold with a core consisting of nine β-
sheets and ten α-helices (Figure S1). Comparison of the apo
structure of PES-H1 with the structures of other bacterial PET
hydrolases resulted in low root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) values for the protein backbone (Table S3). These
highly conserved structures form a distinct subclass of the α/β-
hydrolase superfamily.
6
PES-H1 has a catalytic triad consisting
of S130, H208, and D176 (Figure 1). The nucleophile S130 is
located within hydrogen bond distance to be polarized by the
base H208, which is in turn stabilized by the acid D176. PES-
H1 forms an intramolecular disulfide bridge like structurally
similar homologous enzymes (e.g., PDB codes: 5XH3, 3VIS,
4CGI, 4EB0, 4WFJ, and 1JFR). This conserved disulfide
bridge (C241/C256) connects two loops between the last β-
sheet (Figure S1).
Binding Modes of Substrate Analogues and Degra-
dation Intermediates. Although more than 70 crystal
structures of bacterial PET-degrading enzymes are available
in the PDB database, the majority of them are apo structures
Figure 1. Structural comparison of PES-H1 (salmon, PDB code:
7CUV) and PES-H2 (light blue, PDB code: 7W69). The locations of
the variable residues L/F209, D/N232, and S/A254 are indicated.
The variable position A/E1 is located at the flexible N-terminal ends
of PES-H1 and PES-H2 and are therefore not visible. The S130−
H208−D176 catalytic triad is also shown. The amino acid residues are
shown as sticks in red for PES-H1 and in dark blue for PES-H2. The
inset in the right upper panel demonstrates the close vicinity of the
variable position L/F209 to the catalytic triad.

with no substrate bound.

In order to investigate the
mechanism of PET hydrolysis, we solved the structures of
PES-H1 in complex with citrate (PDB code: 7E30) and also in
complex with the nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue 4-(2-
hydroxyethylcarbamoyl) benzoic acid (MHETA) (PDB codes:
7W6C, 7W6O, and 7W6Q; Figure 2B−F), to better
understand changes in the protein structure upon binding a
PET substrate based on this analogue. We also solved the
structures of PES-H2 in complex with polyethylene glycol
(PEG) 6000 (PDB code: 7E31) and in complex with bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) (PDB code: 7W66;
Figure 2G) (Tables S1 and S2). Based on the structures of
PES-H1 (with bound MHETA) and PES-H2 (with bound
BHET), six ligand-binding modes were identified. The
orientations of the ligands in the substrate binding cavities
are distinct but similar to those observed for HEMT bound to
IsPETase R103G/S131A
28
(PDB code: 5XH3; Figure 2I) and
MHET bound to the S165A variant of LCC ICCG
23
(PDB
code: 7VVE; Figure 2H).
While the structures of LCC ICCG S165A (PDB code:
7VVE; Figure 2H) and IsPETase R103G/S131A (PDB code:
5XH3; Figure 2I) exhibited productive ligand conformations
with the ester carbonyl carbons interacting with the oxygen of
the catalytic serine residue, the PES-H structures revealed
multiple noncatalytic intermediate binding modes (IBMs) with
the ester bonds (or amide bond in MHETA) positioned too
far from S130 for nucleophilic attack. This supports the
previous hypothesis that PET hydrolysis may involve dynamic
reorientation of polymer chains in the active sites of PET
hydrolases.
15,35
MHET and BHET have frequently been found
to inhibit enzymatic PET depolymerization.
36,37
The multiple
IBMs suggest an enhanced residence likelihood of these
inhibitory degradation intermediates in the substrate-binding
groove, where they may prevent productive binding of
polyester segments.
The conformational flexibility of predominantly hydro-
phobic residues surrounding the active site may help to
recognize and bind bulky PET substrates during biocatalysis.
In the enzyme−substrate complex structures of LCC ICCG
S165A (Figure 2H) and IsPETase R103G/S131A (Figure 2I),
the aromatic rings of the substrate analogues are T-stacked to
W190 and W156, respectively. This effect has been proposed
to be very important for PET binding.
38
Similar π-stacking
interactions with the equivalent W155 were discovered in the
PES-H1 structures 7W6C (Figure 2B, F), 7W6O
A
(Figure
2C), and 7W6Q
A
(Figure 2D). In most IBMs of MHETA
ligands (Figure 2B−F), the hydroxyl end of the ethanolamine
moiety points away from the catalytic triad. This is partly in
agreement with the MHET conformation shown in 7VVE
(Figure 2H), which is different from the position of the
ethylene glycol (EG) moiety of HEMT bound to IsPETase
R103G/S131A (5XH3; Figure 2I). MHETA ligands also
interacted with other hydrophobic residues like F62, I178, and
L209 in the binding groove of PES-H1. The backbone amide
NH groups of M131 and F62 form an oxyanion hole, which is
a characteristic shared by many α/β-hydrolases. Terephthalate
(TPA) moieties in our structures are found in close vicinity to
F62 (equivalent to Y95 in LCC ICCG S165A and Y58 in
IsPETase R103G/S131A), rather than close to the catalytic
triads as in IsPETase R103G/S131A (Figure 2I) and LCC
ICCG S165A (7VVE
A
; Figure 2H). Furthermore, the hydroxyl
end of the ethanolamine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with
H184 (Figure 2C,D). The only distinct MHETA binding
mode in PES-H1 was observed in 7W6O
B
(Figure 2E), in
which MHETA is bound at the surface of PES-H1, slightly
outside the catalytic cavity. This binding mode suggests that

substrates can bind at the surface prior to entering deeper into
the active site cavity. BHET is more loosely bound to PES-H2
(7W66
B
; Figure 2G). It is embedded in a groove consisting of
S130, H207, W155, I178, H129, F62, and M131. The ester
bond between the TPA and EG moieties is closer to S130 but
is still outside the catalytic distance, in contrast to the
positioning of MHETA in PES-H1. The TPA moiety is close
to F62 but far from W155. The second EG moiety is
completely exposed to the solvent and has no obvious
interactions with any residue.
MD Simulations to Study the Interactions of PES-H1
with a PET Oligomer. To better understand the mechanism
of PET hydrolysis, we performed MD simulations of PES-H1
in complex with a modeled oligomer consisting of three
repeating PET units (3PET) (Figure S3C) to resemble the
binding of a longer polymer segment. PES-H1 remained stable
in MD simulations at a time scale of 100 ns as indicated by the
steady low backbone RMSD of less than 1 Å compared to the
crystal structure (Figure S2). The modeled PES-H1-3PET
complex corresponds to a productive state with short distances
between the oxyanion hole amides and the central 3PET
carbonyl oxygen atom (2.32 and 1.80 Å), and between the
carbonyl carbon of an ester in 3PET and the side chain oxygen
of the catalytic S130 (2.32 Å). Unfluctuating distances of the
3PET carbonyl carbons to the catalytic S130 verified the
productive state of the modeled oligomer during three
independent 100 ns MD simulations (Figure S3). Nonetheless,
3PET was slightly flexible in the PES-H1 binding site (Figure
S3A). To identify the most favorable 3PET binding modes, we
concatenated the trajectories and clustered the 3PET

activities and thermostabilities. Changes in T

compared to the wild-type enzyme (ΔT

conformations. The four most populated clusters correspond
to the four preferred binding modes, each including >5% of all
ligand conformations (Figure S4). Cluster 1 represents the
3PET binding mode adopted in about 28% of the
conformations (Table S4, Figure S4C). After superimposing
the PES-H1 (PDB code: 7CUV) and LCC ICCG S165A
structures (PDB code: 7VVE), the central PET unit of cluster
1 and the MHET overlap well with an RMSD of 2.95 Å, while
the binding mode of cluster 3 (found in about 8% of all
conformations) deviates the most from that of MHET, with an
RMSD of 4.01 Å (Figure S4D). This suggests that being
adjacent to S130 results in multiple beneficial interactions
between PET and the surrounding residues. Evaluating the
interaction energies of the four binding poses demonstrated
that hydrophobic Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between the
side chains and the central 3PET unit had a predominant
influence on binding. F62, W155, and I178 formed strong LJ
interactions (<−10 kJ mol
−1
), in agreement with their close
interactions with soaked MHETA ligands (Figure 2B−D,F,G).
H208 and M131 also formed strong LJ interactions (<−7 kJ
mol
−1
) (Figures 1 and 3; Figure S4C). Additionally, T63, A64,
and L209 mediate strong LJ interactions (<−7 kJ mol
−1
) with
all three units of 3PET. The side chains of F62 and W155 form
stable aromatic interactions with the aromatic rings of 3PET.
The orientation of the TPA moieties suggest T-stacking
interactions with W155, in agreement with the orientation of
MHETA bound to PES-H1 (PDB codes: 7W6C
A
, 7W6C
b
7W6O
A
, and 7W6Q
A
) and with earlier studies on other PET
hydrolases.
12,23
Furthermore, the strong LJ interactions with
F62 are in agreement with the close proximity between
MHETA and F62. The Coulomb interactions involve fewer
residues and are often mediated by backbone atoms of
residues, like F62 and M131 from the oxyanion hole, and L92,
but can also involve side chains of residues like Q94, H208,
N212, and the catalytic S130 (<−7 kJ mol
−1
). It should be
emphasized that the significant contributions by L92 and Q94
are the result of hydrogen bonding with the terminal carboxyl
group of the first PET unit, which should only occur when
exoscission of polymeric PET substrates takes place. When the
total interaction energy is considered, G61, H129, and T157
are also identified as strong PET-binding residues (<−7 kJ
mol
−1
).
Engineering PES-H1 for Improved Thermostability
and Activity on Amorphous PET Film. Elevated reaction
temperatures of up to 75 °C increase polymer chain mobility,
making the amorphous fractions of PET more accessible to
enzymatic hydrolysis. We investigated enzymatic PET
degradation at 72 °C because it is the optimal temperature
for the hydrolysis of amorphized PET waste by the reference
enzyme LCC ICCG.
5
Empirical data have shown that the T
m
of a PET hydrolase is usually at least 12 °C higher than its
T
opt
.
5,11,13,17
Hence, biocatalysts with a T
m
over 85 °C are
preferred for efficient PET degradation. When determined in
buffers with low ionic strengths (Table S5), PES-H1 had a T
m
of 77.1 °C, as determined by nano differential scanning
fluorimetry (NanoDSF) and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). This is in agreement with previously published data.
34
In the 1 M potassium phosphate buffer demonstrated by
previous studies to be optimal for PET degradation by selected
enzymes,
33,34,39
the T
m
of PES-H1 was increased to 85 °C

(Table S5), thereby enabling its application at 72 °C (Figure
S5). Because high salt concentrations are not ideal for
industrial processes, we investigated the degradation of Gf-
PET film by PES-H1 in the presence of lower phosphate buffer
concentrations (Figure S6). The results demonstrated a
positive correlation between the buffer concentration and the
PET degradation performance of wild-type PES-H1 at 72 °C.
This is most likely due to the decreased thermostability of
PES-H1 at lower buffer concentrations (Table S5).
Many homologous PET hydrolases, including PES-H1 itself,
have been found to be stabilized in the presence of Ca
2+
ions,
as indicated by increased T
m
, improved PET-hydrolyzing
activity, or both.
13,17,18
Ca
2+
binding can be mediated by
several negatively charged residues. For example, D250 and
E296 in the homologous Cut190 from Saccharomonospora
viridis were identified by crystallographic investigations to be
involved in Ca
2+
binding (Figure 3B).
40
Ca
2+
can be
precipitated by buffer ions like phosphate and also by the
PET hydrolysis product terephthalate,
6,41
making the depend-
ence of PET hydrolase stability on Ca
2+
undesirable. This
dependence can be significantly mitigated by replacing the
Ca
2+
binding residues by a disulfide bridge to generate variants
that are thermostable in the absence of Ca
2+
.
5,19,11,17,20−22
Accordingly, we generated an R204C/S250C variant of PES-
H1 and confirmed disulfide bond formation using Ellman’s
reagent (Figure S7). The T
m
of this variant was increased by
6.4 °C (Figure 3L, Table S5). Previous studies reported that
introducing disulfide bridges at equivalent positions of
homologous PET hydrolases resulted in higher increases in
T
m
(TfCut2, ΔT

= 24.9 °C; IsPETase, ΔT
m
= 22.3 °C; LCC,

While more
negatively charged amino acids like D250 and E296 in Cut190
(Figure 3B), D238 and S283 in LCC (Figure 3C), and D204
and E253 in TfCut2 (Figure 3D) are frequently observed at
these sites, wild-type IsPETase (N204 and S253) and PES-H1
(R204 and S250, Figure 3A) lack these negatively charged
residues. This suggests that the generic thermostabilizing effect
of an engineered disulfide bridge at this position might be due
to a variety of interactions rather than just replacing the Ca
2+
binding site. After 24 h at 72 °C, both the wild-type and the
R204C/S250C variant of PES-H1 hydrolyzed Gf-PET film
(98% depolymerization) almost completely (Figure 4A).
Recently, Nakamura et al. reported an R47C/G89C variant
of the homologous hydrolase PET2 and validated the
formation of a disulfide bridge by X-ray crystallography.
22
Compared to wild-type PET2, the T
m
of the R47C/G89C
variant of PET2 was increased by 3.1 °C, and its PET
hydrolysis activity was 1.3-fold higher. We created a R6C/
S49C variant in an attempt to form an equivalent disulfide
bridge in PES-H1. This variant was inactive and was therefore
not further investigated.
The PES-H1 structure (PDB code: 7CUV, Figure 3E) was
compared to the thermostabilized DuraPETase (PDB code:
6KYS, Figure 3F) for identifying additional mutation hotspots.
Using Rosetta energy calculations, an L92F/Q94Y variant of
PES-H1 was constructed based on the L117F/Q119Y
mutations present in DuraPETase. The L92F/Q94Y variant
of PES-H1 had a 1.8 °C higher T
m
and could almost
completely depolymerize Gf-PET film after 24 h at 72 °C
(Figures 3L and 4A). Interestingly, the aromatic amino acids
that we introduced (L92F/Q94Y) correspond to equivalent
residues (F125 and Y127) in LCC ICC.
5
Interestingly, LCC
ICC was converted to the more active LCC ICCG by removal
of the tyrosine residue (Y127G), while introduction of the
equivalent tyrosine into PES-H1 (Q94Y) in combination with
L92F resulted in increased activity. The L92F/Q94Y variant of
PES-H1 outperformed LCC ICCG in the hydrolysis of various
PET materials under conditions optimal for PES-H1 (Figure
4A,B). Cui et al. also observed synergistic effects between the
equivalent L117F (L92F in PES-H1) and Q119Y (Q94Y in
PES-H1) substitutions.
26
They argued that these aromatic
residues interact with other residues (S214, W185, and Y87) to
form an “aromatic tunnel” that facilitates the binding of PET
chains to the active site. The hydrophobic nature of the
mutations enhances noncovalent interactions with the
substrate and improves the overall hydrophobic packing and
stability of DuraPETase. The same effect could explain the
increased activity and stability of the L92F/Q94Y variant of
PES-H1. We introduced the previously discussed disulfide
bridge (R204C/S250C) to the L92F/Q94Y variant to generate
the L92F/Q94Y/R204C/S250C variant of PES-H1. Although
the T
m
of this variant was increased by 4.8 °C, it was not
further characterized because it hydrolyzed Gf-PET film less
efficiently than wild-type PES-H1 (Figure 3L).
Of the four residues that differ between PES-H1 and PES-
H2, only L209 is located close to the active site (Figures 1 and
3G). This site has repeatedly been recognized as an
engineering hotspot in other homologous PET hydrolases
due to its potential interactions with polymeric substrates.
Variants with increased specific activity on PET have been
created by replacing F at this position with A (TfCut2:
F208A), W (LCC WCCG: F243W), or I (LCC ICCG: F243I;
Figure 3I,J).
5,42
The equivalent S of IsPETase (Figure 3K) has
also been replaced with F, but an additional W159H
substitution was required for improved PET hydrolysis
activity.
43
It was recently shown that exchanging L209 in
PES-H1 (called PHL7 by Sonnendecker et al.
34
) to the F
found in PES-H2 (Fig 3G,H) reduced PET hydrolysis activity
by half. We obtained similar results for the hydrolysis of Gf-
PET film by the L209F variant of PES-H1 (Figure 3L). We
subjected position L209 to saturation mutagenesis and found
that most variants (except L209K, L209R, L209E, L209P, and
L209I) resulted in enhanced thermostability. For the L209W,
L209F, and L209Y variants, the highest ΔT
m
in 50 mM
phosphate buffer ranged from 3.3 to 3.7 °C (Figure 3L).
However, the PET hydrolysis activities of these variants were
decreased by more than 15%. Several earlier studies
43,44
suggested that the S238F substitution (equivalent to L209F in
PES-H1) in the W159H/S238F variant of IsPETase narrowed
the active site cleft, potentially enhancing π-stacking between
PET and F238. In contrast, Furukawa et al.
42
suggested that
the corresponding F of TfCut2 restricts access to lcPET,
attributing the influence of this residue on catalytic activity to
side-chain volume rather than hydrophobicity. Therefore, the
role of this important residue is still not fully understood, and
it may play different roles in different PET hydrolases.
In addition, we engineered several key residues potentially
involved in strong interactions with PET as indicated by
structures of PES-H1 and PES-H2 in complex with PET
analogues (Figure 2) and MD simulations (Figure S4). These
include F62 (Figure 2B−D,G), W155 (Figure 2B−D,F,G), and
I178 (Figure 2E). F62 is part of the oxyanion hole. Except for
PES-H1, Cut190,
18
and Tcur1278,
45
other known homologous
PET hydrolases have a tyrosine at this position. Introducing
this tyrosine into PES-H1 (F62Y) lowered the hydrolytic

9795

activity drastically but had no influence on T
m
(Figure 3L).
The same effects were observed for the F62A variant.
The W155 residue of PES-H1 is equivalent to the W185
residue of IsPETase. The W185 of IsPETase (W130 in Figure
2I due to different residue numbering in the 5XH3 crystal
structure) is flexible and can move to open or close access to
the active site.
43
This wobbling is beneficial for mesophilic
PET hydrolases because the PET polymer chain has lower
chain mobility at ambient temperatures, and a flexible W185
may facilitate substrate binding.
15
This dynamic tryptophan is
conserved in many homologous PET hydrolases and is
involved in strong interactions with the aromatic rings of
PET. We replaced the W155 of PES-H1 to A, F or H, resulting
in almost complete loss of activity and considerably reduced
stability (Figure 3L). Austin et al. reported similarly reduced
activity for the equivalent W185A variant of IsPETase.
43
In
contrast, the conformation of the corresponding W190 (Figure
2H) in the thermophilic LCC ICCG is fixed by interactions
with H218 and F222 (H184 and F188 in PES-H1, Figure
2C,D,F). As a result, LCC ICCG has a more rigid substrate-
binding groove, yet it still allows PET binding at elevated
temperatures as a result of increased polymer chain mobility.
23
The I178 residue is located near the catalytic triad of PES-
H1 (Figure 2B−D,F). Previous studies have reported
substitutions of this I178 residue in homologous Thermobif ida
f usca cutinases to smaller residues like S or A, which resulted in
PET hydrolyzing activities comparable to that of the wild-type
enzyme.
46,47
Therefore, we instead substituted I178 to large
aromatic residues. However, the I178W, I178F, and I178Y
variants lost significant PET hydrolysis activity, and their T
m
decreased slightly, suggesting that additional aromatic
interactions may hinder productive binding of PET chains.
Therefore, we did not further investigate the I178 residue of
PES-H1.
Comparing the Hydrolytic Activity of Selected PES-
H1 Variants on Different PET Materials. The L92F/Q94Y
and R204C/S250C variants of PES-H1 were further
investigated using different PET materials. The crystallinity
of real-world postconsumer PET waste depends on its thermal
history and life cycle.
6
Therefore, for biocatalytic recycling at
the industrial scale, pretreatment by thermomechanical
amorphization and micronization is essential to provide
uniformly degradable substrates (in terms of comparable
crystallinity, particle size, etc.).
5,48
In this study, we used a
melt-quenching technique to amorphize postconsumer PET
bottles, which were then micronized by various methods.
Crystallinity of the PET bottle waste was decreased from 27%
to 19% after melt-quenching and increased again to 33% and
26%, respectively, after crushing or ball milling (Table S6).
The crystallinity values determined with differently micronized
PET powders are in good agreement with two previous
studies.
48,49
However, the crystallinities of our samples were
markedly higher than that reported by Tournier et al., who
used other techniques.
5
We determined the average molecular
masses of selected PET samples by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) and found that values decreased
after melt-quenching and micronization (Table S6). Since the
particle size can influence the biocatalytic degradability of PET
powders, it was important to use similarly sized particles for all
assays. Therefore, we sieved all micronized PET samples using
a 177 μm mesh to obtain more homogeneous powders.
LCC ICCG and the wild-type PES-H1 were used as
reference enzymes. The distinct distribution of charged amino
acids at the surfaces of these two enzymes may explain the
differences in their buffer requirements (Figure S8). Compared
to PES-H1, LCC ICCG does not lose its thermostability and
PET degrading activity at a low phosphate buffer concentration
(100 mM).
5
However, higher phosphate concentrations (up to
1 M) do not reduce the PET hydrolysis activity of wild-type
LCC.
15,39,50
Since 1 M phosphate buffer is optimal for the
activity and stability of PES-H1 while not negatively
influencing LCC, we used this buffer for all subsequent PET
degradation experiments. As shown in Figure 4A, wild-type
PES-H1 and the L92F/Q94Y variant completely depolymer-
ized Gf-PET film in 24 h at 72 °C. Therefore, we also
determined the weight loss after 12 h of incubation. The
highest weight loss of 37.1 mg (62.4%) was obtained with the
L92F/Q94Y variant, and this was 2.3-fold higher than with
wild-type PES-H1. The L92F/Q94Y variant also significantly
outperformed both the R204C/S250C variant and LCC ICCG
in the hydrolysis of Gf-PET film (Figure 4A). Averaged
conversion rates of 2.5 mg
PET
h
−1
and 2.3 mg
PET
h
−1
were
obtained using wild-type PES-H1 and LCC ICCG, respec-
tively. While the value for PES-H1 is similar to that previously
determined by Sonnendecker et al.,
34
the value for LCC ICCG
is markedly lower than that reported by Tournier et al.
5
As
explained above, this may in part be due to differences between
the PET materials used in different studies. Based on the
information provided by the manufacturer, Gf-PET films differ
considerably in terms of crystallinity, thickness, molecular
mass, and many other polymer parameters, making a direct
comparison of data generated in different studies impossible.
6
After 24 h at 72 °C, the degradation performance of PES-
H1, L92F/Q94Y, R204C/S250C, and LCC ICCG on low-
crystallinity (13%) micronized waste PET powder was
comparable to that on Gf-PET film. The L92F/Q94Y variant
yielded 2.9-fold and 2.2-fold more degradation products than
wild-type PES-H1 and LCC ICCG, respectively (Figure 4B).
This indicated that, under the applied degradation conditions,
the L92F/Q94Y variant was the most active lcPET hydrolase.
The R204C/S250C variant was as active as the wild-type PES-
H1 in hydrolyzing lcPET materials (Figure 4A,B). However,
the R204C/S250C variant was significantly less active than the
wild-type against hcPET materials (Figure 4C,D). In contrast,
the L92F/Q94Y variant was more active than the wild-type
PES-H1 against hcPET powders, forming up to 3.4-fold more
degradation products (Figure 4D). For hydrolyzing hcPET
powders (Figure 4C,D) generated by different pretreatment
methods, LCC ICCG outperformed all PES-H1 variants and
yielded up to 4.0-fold more degradation products than the
L92F/Q94Y variant (Figure 4C,D). While the crystallinities of
the crushed and ball-milled PET powders were clearly higher
than the degradable threshold value of approximately 20%
suggested by Wei et al.
25
and Thomsen et al.,
24
LCC ICCG
surprisingly released more degradation products from these
substrates than from lcPET powder (13% crystallinity) (Figure
4B−D). By comparison with PES-H1 and its variants, the
extent of degradation was inversely correlated to the material
crystallinity, which is in agreement with previous research on
using hydrolases to degrade PET with varying crystallinities.
6
In addition to the crystallinity values obtained by DSC, we
also determined the number-average (M
n
) and weight-average
(M
w
) molecular masses of the PET powders used for the
enzymatic degradation experiments (Table S6). The lower M
n
values determined for the hcPET powders derived from ball-
milled and grinder-crushed PET bottle waste than that with
ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article

the grinder-crushed PET film means that the PET bottle
powders contained significantly shorter polymers (or even
oligomers). When the degradation by PES-H1, its variants, and
LCC ICCG (Figure 4B−D) is interpreted in terms of the
molecular masses of the PET powders, it appears that M
n
had a
larger influence on the degradation by LCC ICCG than by
PES-H1 and its variants. LCC ICCG seems to hydrolyze
shorter polymers more efficiently, while the degradation by
PES-H1 and its variants seems to be more influenced by
crystallinity. Tournier et al.
5
found that LCC ICCG could not
efficiently depolymerize the hcPET obtained by their pretreat-
ment methods, but they did not report the molecular masses of
their materials. Therefore, a direct comparison of our data to
that reported by Tournier et al.
5
cannot be made, but our data
suggest that not only crystallinity but also average polymer
length may influence the enzymatic degradation of PET. This
suggests that crystallinity might be only one of several
important polymer characteristics that influence enzymatic
degradation and that polymer properties should be more
extensively characterized in future studies. The superiority of
the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 in degrading lcPET is
important since industrially amorphized PET waste has
crystallinities below 15%.
5
The L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-
H1 could therefore be investigated as an alternative to LCC
ICCG for PET hydrolysis.
A heterogeneous kinetic model described by the following
equation has been widely used for evaluating enzymatic PET
hydrolysis.

PES-H1, its variants, and LCC ICCG. The rates of turbidity
change measured at 600 nm as a result of PET-NP degradation
were determined in a microplate reader at 70 °C (Figures S9
and S10). The kinetic constants determined according to eq 1
are summarized in Table 1. The initial reaction velocity v
0
was
defined as the turbidity decrease over a reaction time of 40 min
using 0.5 mg mL
−1
PET-NP (Figure S9). The L92F/Q94Y
variant resulted in the highest hydrolysis rate constant (k

LCC ICCG (0.048 mL mg

). The adsorption
equilibrium constant K
A
is a parameter to evaluate the enzyme
affinity to PET-NP. The R204C/S250C variant had the lowest
affinity to PET, while the L92F/Q94Y variant had the highest
affinity, which was 1.8-fold higher than that of wild-type PES-
H1 and 1.4-fold higher than that of LCC ICCG. The high
affinity of the L92F/Q94Y variant to PET nanoparticles
demonstrates the importance of the adsorption of enzymes to
the surface of PET-NP for efficient hydrolysis. The K
A
values
determined in this study fall in the same range as those
determined for many homologous PET hydrolases by other
procedures.
12,45,46,51,52
In general, the kinetic data, depicted in
Table 1 and Table S7 support the observations made using
other PET materials (Figure 4A,B). Additionally, we measured
the initial hydrolysis rate as a function of the substrate
concentration in the range 0−0.5 mg mL
−1
using a constant
enzyme concentration of 0.7 μM. This enzyme concentration
was selected to ensure substrate-saturated conditions (Figure
S9). The experimental data fit well to the kinetic model
(Figures S9 and S10), demonstrating that under these
conditions the model describes the experimental data
accurately.
■
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we solved crystal structures of the thermophilic
enzymes PES-H1 and PES-H2 in apo form and notably also in
complexes with the PET monomer analogues MHETA and
BHET. This enabled the identification of six intermediate
binding modes and several key residues involved in binding to
PET. MD simulations supported the involvement of these
residues in PET binding. Structural analyses and previously
identified mutational hotspots were used to select PES-H1
residues for mutagenesis. Several PES-H1 variants with
improved thermostability and PET hydrolysis activity were
identified. The most active L92F/Q94Y variant outperformed
the reference enzyme LCC ICCG in hydrolyzing lcPET
materials (<15% crystallinity). Its superior activity over wild-
type PES-H1 was also evident with other hcPET materials
derived from real-world PET bottle waste. Our detailed
structural analyses provide a better understanding of the
mechanisms of interfacial biocatalysis, and our engineered
variants hold promise for future applications in biocatalytic
plastic recycling.
