Retron is a retroelement that encodes msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA) which was signiﬁcantly found mainly in Gram-
negative pathogenic bacteria. W e screened Y ersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 contig01029 for the presence of retroelement by
using bioinformatics tools and characterized a novel retron-Yf79 on the chromosome that encodes msDNA-Yf79. In this study, we
perceived that, the codon usage of retron-Yf79 were noteworthy di ﬀerent from those of the Y. frederiksenii genome. It demonstrates
that, the retron-Yf79 was a foreign DNA element and integrated into this organism genome during their evolution. In addition to
this, we have observed a transposase gene which is located just downstream of retron-Yf79. So, the enzyme might be responsible
for the transposition of this novel retron element.
1. Introduction
For the past 21 years, it has been shown that some pathogenic
Gram-negative bacteria strains contain genetic elements
called retrons. Retron is a retroelement consisting of msr,
which encodes the RNA part of msDNA, msd, which encodes
the DNA part of msDNA, and the ret gene for reverse
transcriptase (RT) [ 1]. The reverse transcriptase (RT) was
originally discovered in virus [ 2] as an essential enzyme for
the replication of retroviruses. Since the discovery of RT
in myxobacteria [ 3]a n d Escherichia coli [4] an intriguing
question have been raised concerning its origin and function
in the prokaryotes [ 5].
The msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA) is com-
posed of a small, single-stranded DNA, linked to a small,
single-stranded RNA molecule. The 5
′ end of the DNA
molecule is joined to an internal guanine base (G) residue of
the RNA molecule by a unique 2
′,5 ′-phosphodiester bond
[6]. Since msDNA was originally discovered in the Gram-
negative soil bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus [7] it was also
isolated from aggregative adherence E. coli (AAEC) [ 8],
a classical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) [ 9]a n dm o r e
recently from Vibrio cholerae [10], Salmonella enterica ser-
ovar Typhimurium [ 5], V. p a r a h a e m o l y t i c u sand V . mim-
icus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data). Hence, RT
might have a role in diversiﬁcation of pathogenic bacteria
genomes.
Although msDNAs have been isolated over the path-
ogenic Gram-negative bacteria, in this study we character-
ized a novel retron region by screening the complete genome
sequence of Y ersinia frederiksenii [11] which encodes msr,
msd with a ret gene by best hits RT sequence similarity along
with V . cholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium.
These provide insight into the important roles of this mys-
terious element in these bacteria species.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Genomic Analysis of Retron-Yf79.
2.1.1. Sequence Retrieval. T o determine the particular place
of retron-Yf79, the complete nucleotide genome sequence of
Y ersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 contig01029 was retrieved
from the national center for biotechnology information
(NCBI) resource at ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with the
following accession number (AALE02000035) [ 11]. T o inves-
tigate an evolutionary relationship among amino acid se-
quence of reverse transcriptases from Y. frede r iks e nii, V.
cholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium; were col-
lected from ExPASy proteomics server at ( http://www.expasy
.org/). In addition, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA)
nucleotide sequences of Y. frede r iks e nii, V . cholerae, V . para-
haemolyticus and S. Typhimurium were collected from the
kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) organism
database available at GenomeNet server, Japan ( http://www
.genome.jp/) to observe the possible evolutionary scenario
among those species.
2.1.2. Sequence Alignment. The genomic organization of
msd-msr region of retron-Yf79 was determined according to
their nucleotide sequences analyzing, that is, the presence
of conserved region nucleotides with other msr-msd coding
regions which have been isolated from various pathogenic
bacteria- ( V . cholerae, V . parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimu-
rium) by using (ClustalW) program available at ( http://www
.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan [ 12]. T o evaluate the
similarity of RT-Yf79 with others RT-Vc95 from V. c h o l e r a e
[10], RT-Vp96 from V. p a r a h a e m o l y t i c u s(Shimamoto T,
2003, unpublished data) and RT-St85 from S. Ty phimu-
rium [ 5], the alignment program was utilized at the
site (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/)[ 12], after deter-
mining the best hit of RTs sequence similarity search by
the BLAST program at NCBI Blast homepage ( http://www
.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
2.1.3. Structure Prediction and Codon Bias Analysis. The
DNA and RNA secondary structures of msDNA-Yf79 were
predicted by using the database-( http://www.ncrna.org/
centroidfold/)[ 13]. The promoter sequence of retron-Yf79
was predicted on the basis of the conserved promoter
sequences [ 14]. T o appraise whether the retron is a foreign
DNA element, the codon bias was carried out. The codon
bias of retron-Yf79 and the whole organism genome was
resolute by using codon usage database-( http://www.kazusa
.or.jp/codon)[ 15].
2.1.4. Phylogenetic Analysis. T o evaluate the origin and
similarity of RT-Yf79 from Y. frede r iks e nii, phylogenetic tree
was constructed by using other RTs from ( V. c h o l e r a e , V.
parahaemolyticus and S. Typhimurium). These amino acid
sequences were aligned along with each other by using
(ClustalW) at ( http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan
[12]. The sequence alignment was performed under default
conditions and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by
the neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic tree of
16S ribosomal RNAs was also constructed based on their
nucleotide sequences by using same database available at
(http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/), Japan [ 12].
3. Results
3.1. The Structure of msDNA-Yf79. Analysis of msd nu-
cleotide sequence showed that the DNA part of msDNA
found in Y. frede r iks e niiis predicted to consist of 79 bases of
a single-stranded DNA, and hence it was named as msDNA-
Yf79, and the RNA part of msDNA-Yf79 consists of 70
bases encoded by msr gene of retron-Yf79 ( Figure 1(a) ).
Furthermore, the guanine base (G) residue at position 12
of the RNA molecule branched out by a unique 2
′,5 ′-
phosphodiester link ( Figure 1(a) ). The msDNAs isolated
from other bacteria contains at least one mismatched base
pair in their DNA stems which could be mutagenic [ 16,
17]. However, in this study we observed that the DNA
structure of msDNA-Yf79 contains no any mismatched base
pair as like as most of msDNAs were isolated from other
pathogenic bacteria ( Figure 1(a) ). Further, the msDNA-Yf79
shared a number of conserved nucleotide sequences with
other msDNAs (msDNA-St85,-Vc95 and -Vp96) ( Figure 1 ),
except thymine (T) at position 67 in DNA part of msDNA-
Yf79 ( Figure 1(a) ).
3.2. Genomic Organization of Retron-Yf79. The retron-Yf79
consists of nucleotide sequence of about 2.8 Kb, and the
retron element is transcribed from the
−35 and −10 con-
served promoter sequence located 5 bp upstream to the msr-
msd coding region (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). In addition, two
open reading frames (ORFs) were located just downstream
of msr and msd coding sequence, one is RT-Yf79 encoded
retron-type reverse transcriptase having 310 amino acids,
and another one is ORF-541 which encoded a putative ATP
binding protein containing 541 amino acids ( Figure 2(a) ).
The upstream and downstream regions of retron element
also contained yfred0001
42820 gene that encoded a hypo-
thetical protein (356 AAs) and Yred0001 42860 gene that
encoded a transposase (308 AAs), respectively ( Figure 2(a) ).
3.3. Codon Usage of Retron-Yf79. T o identify the origin of
RT-Yf79 and ORF-541 genes in Y. frede r iks e niigenome, the
codon usages were carried out. It revealed that the RT-Yf79
and ORF-541 genes used AAA codon for lysine with a fre-
quency of 55% and 74%, respectively, but the Y. frede r iks e nii
genome only used AAA codon for lysine with a frequency
of 20% of the time (data not shown). Present observation
suggested that the retron-Yf79 is a foreign DNA element and
probably acquired in this organism chromosome from other
ancestral species during their evolution times.
3.4. Comparative Study of RT-Yf79 with Other ret Genes
from Di ﬀerent Pathogenic Bacteria. The RT-Yf79 encoded by
the retron-Yf79 consists of 310 AA residues. Surprisingly,
all retron RTs in pathogenic bacteria were shown to have

ribosomal RNA phylogenetic analysis suggested that, these

4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that a new msDNA-Yf79 ex-
ists in Y. frede r iks e niiATCC 33641 contig01029 cell types and
compared it’s properties to that of St85 [ 5], Vc95 [ 10]a n d
Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data). The retron-
Yf79 was responsible for the production of msDNA-Yf79 in
Y. frede r iks e niiGram-negative pathogenic bacteria strain.
However, the gene organization of retron-Yf79 was
similar to those found in E. coli (retron-Ec83 and -Ec78) [ 8,
9], that is, contained only two open reading frames (ORFs)
in their retroelement. On the other hand, the gene organi-
zation of retron-Vc95 [ 10] and retron-Vp96 (Shimamoto T,
2003, unpublished data) were completely di ﬀerent as they
contained a third ORFs. The msDNA-Yf79 has a sequence
similarity to msDNA-St85, msDNA-Vc95 and msDNA-Vp96
as these msDNAs shared a number of highly conserved bases
in their nucleotide sequences, indicating that they might be
descended from a common origin (i.e., from a common
ancestor). The presence of the conserved guanine base (G)
at position 12 in RNA part of msDNA-Yf79 which involved
in branch formation via a 2
′,5 ′-phosphodiater link in DNA-
RNA complex ( Figure 1(a) ). Lima and Lim suggested that the
fact that the mutation in guanine base (G) prevents msDNA
synthesis and the primary product of reverse transcription
may be a branched DNA-RNA compounds [ 9], which
supports our observation.
Furthermore, it was quite interesting that stem structure
of msDNA-Yf79 did not contained any mismatched base
pair like most of the msDNA isolated from other pathogenic
bacteria. Moreover, the codon usage of this retron element
and also the phylogenetic analysis of RTs and 16S rRNA from
pathogenic bacteria revealed that this retron was a foreign
DNA element. The downstream of retron element-Yf79
contained a transposase gene indicating that this enzyme
might be participated in transposition of this novel retron
element in the genome.

Figure 3: Comparison of the amino acids sequence alignment of the RT-Yf79 with the three highest identity RT sequences: RT-Vc95 (44%
identity), RT-Vp96 (45% identity), and RT-St85 (43% identity). Amino acids conserved in all four RT s are marked with asterisks and black
colors. Conserved and well-conserved amino acids residues are marked with dots and the number of amino acids of each RT was written at
the end of the alignment.

Figure 4: Phylogenetic trees among Y. frederiksenii, V . cholerae, V .
parahaemolyticus, and S . Typhimurium based on the RT (a) and the
16S ribosomal RNA genes (b). The trees were constructed by using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in the CluslalW program. The
following ExPASy accession numbers for the RT sequences were
used in the phylogenetic construction: Y. frederiksenii RT-Yf79-
C4SUU2, V. c h o l e r a e RT-Vc95-Q9S1F2, V . parahaemolyticus-
Q8L0W6, and S. Typhimurium- E7UVY4. The following
GenomeNet accession numbers for the 16S rRNA sequences
were used in the phylogenetic construction: Y. frederiksenii-
NR
027544.1, V. c h o l e r a e-2614447, V . parahaemolyticus- 1187490
and S. Typhimurium-1251767.
W e resolved after consideration to look closely the
nucleotide sequence of this retron-Yf79 in Y. frede r iks e nii
because this organism has generated signiﬁcant value in the
role of pathogenicity. Functions of msDNA are still not clear.
However, this DNA-RNA complex which was identiﬁed in
Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria may support its role in
the process of pathogenicity. In addition, retron element
may play an essential role for adaptation of such bacteria in
diﬀerent stressful conditions by changing the expression of
their regulatory social behavior under which conditions that
expression is densely populated. Further experiment will be
required for demonstrating the functions of msDNA, which
may be opened a new arena in the process of pathogenicity
or adaptation in stressful conditions.
