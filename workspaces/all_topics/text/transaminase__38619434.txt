Abstract
Background: Recent reports have unveiled the potential utility ofL-carnitine
to alleviate metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) by
enhancing mitochondrial metabolic function. However, its efficacy at
preventing the development of HCC has not been assessed fully.
Methods:
L-carnitine (2 g/d) was administered to 11 patients with MASH for
10 weeks, and blood liver function tests were performed. Five patients
received a serial liver biopsy, and liver histology and hepatic gene expres-
sion were evaluated using this tissue. An atherogenic plus high-fat diet
MASH mouse model received long-term
L-carnitine administration, and liver
histology and liver tumor development were evaluated.
Results: Ten-week L-carnitine administration significantly improved serum
alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels along with a his-
tological improvement in the NAFLD activity score, while steatosis and
fibrosis were not improved. Gene expression profiling revealed a significant
improvement in the inflammation and profibrotic gene signature as well as
the recovery of lipid metabolism. Long-term
L-carnitine administration to
atherogenic plus high-fat diet MASH mice substantially improved liver his-
tology (inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis) and significantly reduced the
incidence of liver tumors.

MASH-associated and stress-induced transcriptional factor early growth
response 1. Early growth response 1 activated the promoter activity of neural
precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated protein 9
(NEDD9), an oncogenic protein. Thus,L-carnitine reduced the activation of
the NEDD9, focal adhesion kinase 1, and AKT oncogenic signaling pathway.
Conclusions: Short-term L-carnitine administration ameliorated MASH
through its anti-inflammatory effects. Long-term L-carnitine administration
potentially improved the steatosis and fibrosis of MASH and may eventually
reduce the risk of HCC.
INTRODUCTION
“Steatotic liver disease” is the newly proposed over-
arching term for metabolic dysfunction –associated
steatotic liver disease (MASLD), replacing NAFLD,
while metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis
(MASH) is the replacement term for NASH.
[1]
MASLD/MASH has emerged as one of the most
prevalent liver conditions globally, posing a significant
and escalating health burden. Especially, the incidence
of MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (MASH-
HCC) has been steadily increasing and it now con-
stitutes a substantial portion of HCC cases. However,
despite its growing prevalence, the pathogenesis of
MASH-HCC remains enigmatic and effective therapeu-
tic strategies are limited.
L-trimethyl-3-hydroxy-ammoniabutanoate, commonly
known as L-carnitine, is an amino acid derivative that
has a pivotal role in orchestrating a multitude of
essential biological processes.
[2–4] L-carnitine plays a
central role in mitochondrial function, facilitating fatty
acid metabolism, and contributing to ATP production.
L-carnitine deficiency can give rise to various metabolic
disorders, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
kidney diseases, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.[5]
Recent reports have unveiled the potential utility of
L-carnitine to alleviate MASLD by enhancing mitochon-
drial metabolic function, promoting the β-oxidation of
free fatty acids, and reducing oxidative damage in liver
cells.
[6–9] Clinical studies and meta-analyses have
further suggested that L-carnitine administration can
significantly improve serum alanine transaminase (ALT)
and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels as well as
NAFLD activity scores in patients with MASH.[10]
Although several mouse models and clinical data
have shown that L-carnitine potentially improves the
metabolic abnormalities and liver dysfunction induced
by MASH, its efficacy in preventing the development of
HCC has not been fully addressed. Previously, we
established a MASH-derived HCC mouse model by
feeding mice an atherogenic plus high-fat diet (Ath
+HFD) for 68 weeks. Ath+HFD mice develop steatosis,
inflammation accompanied by ballooned hepatocytes,
fibrosis, and eventually HCC at a high frequency, which
closely mimic the progression of human MASH-derived
HCC.
[11,12]
In the present study, we showed that L-carnitine
significantly improved the pathophysiology of MASH in
human and mouse livers. We also demonstrated that
long-term
L-carnitine administration substantially sup-
pressed the development of liver tumors in Ath+HFD
MASH model mice. Our data imply the potential utility of
L-carnitine for treating MASH and preventing the
subsequent occurrence of HCC, suggesting the value
of performing large-scale clinical trials of
L-carnitine
for MASH.
METHODS
Patients
Eleven patients who were histologically proven as
MASH by liver biopsy were enrolled in this study
(Figure 1A and Supplemental Table S1, http://links.
lww.com/HC9/A845). We excluded all other liver dis-
orders in each patient. All participants reported drinking
<20 g/day ethanol. All participants were administered
2 g/day
L-carnitine (two 500 mgL-carnitine tablets twice
daily) for 10 weeks, and blood liver function tests and
lipid profiles were monitored. Serial liver biopsies were
taken from five of the patients for histological evalua-
tions (Figure 1A and Supplemental Table S1, http://
links.lww.com/HC9/A845). A single pathologist (Kenichi
Harada), who was blinded to both the clinical informa-
tion (eg, treatment assignments, participant character-
istics, and the order in which the biopsy specimens
were obtained), histologically evaluated all biopsy
specimens. The biopsied tissues were scored for
steatosis (from 0 to 3), stage (from 0 to 4), and grade
(from 0 to 3), as described,
[13,14] according to the
standard criteria of Brunt et al.[15] The NAFLD activity
score was calculated as the unweighted sum of the
scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3),

protocols were approved by the Human Genome/Gene
Analysis Research Ethics Committee of Kanazawa
University and its related hospitals and the study was
conducted in accordance with the Declarations of
Helsinki and Istanbul. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.
Affymetrix GeneChip analysis
An Affymetrix Human 133U Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affy-
metrix) containing 54,675 probes was used as
described previously. The isolation of liver tissue RNA,
amplification, hybridization, and data processing were
also performed as described.
[17]
Hierarchical clustering and pathway
analysis of GeneChip data
To identify differentially expressed genes between
samples taken before and afterL-carnitine administration,
the eBayes method in the limma package was employed.
Genes with a|log2-fold change|> 1 andp value <0.05
were considered statistically significant. Hierarchical
clustering analysis was performed on the differentially
expressed genes to reveal distinct expression patterns
between the before and after
L-carnitine administration
samples. A heatmap was generated to represent visually
the clustering results using the R package Complex-
Heatmap. The identified differentially expressed genes
were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using the
R package clusterProfiler. This analysis assessed
whether predefined gene sets, such as Gene Ontology
terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathways, were significantly enriched among the upre-
gulated or downregulated genes. Single-cell gene
expression data of normal and cirrhotic liver (https://
shiny.igc.ed.ac.uk/livercellatlas/) were utilized.
[18]
Animal studies
The generation and characterization of Ath+HFD mice
were performed as described. [11,12,19] Male C57BL/6
mice (aged 8 weeks, weighing 20–25 g) were main-
tained in a temperature-controlled (22± 2°C) pathogen-
free animal facility under a standard 12-hour light/dark
cycle. Subsequently, the mice were divided randomly
into 4 groups and each group was given one of the
following diets for 12, 30, or 60 weeks: (I) low-fat basal
diet (LFD), (II) Ath+HFD, (III) Ath+HFD supplemented
with 0.5%
L-carnitine, or (IV) Ath+HFD supplemented
with 1% L-carnitine. The mice were killed at weeks 20
and 38 to analyze the progression of hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis or at week 68 to analyze the development
of hepatic tumors. The incidence of hepatic tumors and
liver weight were evaluated. Blood was collected in
Eppendorf tube, kept at 4°C for 30 minutes, and
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Liver
tissues were collected and snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for proteins and in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for RNA extraction and analysis. A portion of
the liver was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin blocks.
All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics
Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at
the Takara-Machi Campus of Kanazawa University,
Japan, and were carried out in compliance with the
ARRIVE guidelines 2.0. All experiments were performed in
accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Histopathology and immunohistochemical
staining
Mouse liver tissues embedded in paraffin blocks in 10%
formalin were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Liver
neoplasms (HCC and liver cell adenoma) were diag-
nosed according to previously described criteria.
[11,12]
Hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by Azan staining using
an image analysis system (BIOREVO BZ-9000; Key-
ence). Immunohistochemical staining was conducted by
an immunoperoxidase technique with an Envision Kit
(Dako). The following primary antibodies were used:
rabbit polyclonal anti-PDGF receptor-beta (1:100 dilu-
tion; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-smooth muscle
actin (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
RNA extraction and real-time detection-
PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tissue samples
in RNAlater using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
from cell samples using a NIPPON RNA Kit (Nippon
Gene). cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA
using a High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time detection-PCR
was conducted using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay
Identification. The following TaqMan probes were used:
Acta2, Col1a2, Tgfb1, Pdgfrb, Pdgfb, Pdgfc, Tnf, Il6,
Il1b, Pparg, Ppara, and Nedd9 (neural precursor cell
by L-carnitine administration. (D) Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining of liver biopsy samples before and afterL-carnitine administration.

(Applied Biosystems). Quantitative gene expression
data were normalized to the expression levels of the
housekeeping gene GAPDH.
Western blotting
Whole-cell lysates from mouse liver and cultured cells
were prepared and lysed in a 1× RIPA Lysis Buffer
(EMD Millipore) containing complete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail and PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science). The
following primary antibodies were used: anti-NEDD9
(1:1000 dilution), anti-FAK (focal adhesion kinase)
(1:1000 dilution), anti-phosphorylated (p)-FAK (Tyr397;
1:1000 dilution), anti-AKT (1:1000 dilution), anti-p-AKT
(Ser473; 1:1000 dilution), and anti-GAPDH (1:1000
dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology).
RNA interference
HepG2 cells were transfected with control (Stealth RNAi
Negative Control Low GC Duplex #2; Invitrogen) or
NEDD9 Stealth small-interfering RNA (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 24 hours, the cells
were harvested for analysis.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean± SD and analyzed
using Prism 9.4.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Experi-
ments were repeated at least 3 times. A two-tailed
unpaired Studentt test or one-way ANOVA was used to
evaluate the data. Pearson correlation coefficients were
used to assess the relationship. Ap value <0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Cell culture, luciferase reporter assay, overexpres-
sion and transfection, recombinant proteins and chem-
icals, immunofluorescence staining, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay are described in the Sup-
plemental Methods, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A846.
RESULTS
Effects ofL-carnitine administration on the
pathophysiology of patients with MASH
Eleven patients with MASH (Supplemental Table S1,
http://links.lww.com/HC9/A845) were administered 2 g
L-carnitine daily for 10 weeks, and serum liver functions
and lipid and glucose levels were compared before and
after L-carnitine administration (Figure 1A). The serum
levels of AST, ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase
were significantly improved byL-carnitine administration.
As for metabolic factors, triglyceride levels were
significantly improved, while total cholesterol levels
were not changed. The levels of fasting glucose and
glycohemoglobin were not significantly changed (data
not shown).
Among the 11 patients enrolled in this study, 5 were
subjected to serial liver biopsies to evaluate the
histological changes induced by
L-carnitine. Histological
examinations revealed a significant improvement in liver
inflammation, NAFLD activity score, and the degree of
inflammation and ballooning ( Figures 1C, D ). In
contrast, steatosis and fibrosis stages were not
improved significantly.
Serial changes in gene expression profiles
in the liver of patients with MASH after 10-
week
L-carnitine administration
To examine the molecular signature that was involved
in the histological improvement in MASH, serial gene
expression profiling using an Affymetrix gene chip
(GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) was
performed with liver biopsy specimens obtained from 5
patients before and after
L-carnitine administration.
Pairwise comparisons before and after L-carnitine
administration revealed 201 differentially expressed
genes (p value <0.05 and fold difference> 2), in which
111 genes were upregulated and 90 genes were
downregulated.
A heatmap of the hierarchical clustering of the 201
differentially expressed genes is presented in
Figure 2A. Overall, the degree of the upregulation and
downregulation of these differentially expressed genes
was well correlated with the NAFLD activity score of
individual patients (Figure 2A). Gene set enrichment
analysis showed reactive oxygen stress repair genes,
such as peroxiredoxin 2 and ubiquinone oxidoreductase
subunit A1, lipid homeostasis-related genes, such as
peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor alpha and
apolipoprotein A5, and fatty acid oxidation-related
genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and
acyl-CoA binding domain-containing 4, were upregu-
lated by
L-carnitine. Conversely, leukocyte activation–
related genes, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 21
and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, TNF-related
genes, such as toll-like receptor 1 and thrombospondin
1, extracellular matrix–related genes, such as collagen
type I alpha 2 chain and collagen type I alpha 1 chain,
and TGF-β–related genes, such as PDGF subunit A and
TGF-β-induced, were downregulated by
L-carnitine
(Figure 1B).
The results of gene set enrichment analysis derived from
different gene sets (Gene Ontology vs. Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes) were compared (Supplemental
Figure S1, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A845). The TGF-β–

related pathway was the most significantly altered in the
Gene Ontology database, while the AKT/FAK pathway was
the most significantly altered in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes database.
Among the top 5 downregulated and top 3 upregulated
genes (Figure 2C), we focused onNEDD9. NEDD9 is
associated with the tumorigenesis of breast cancer
[20] and
ovarian cancer,[21] and the upregulation of NEDD9 in HCC
is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
intrahepatic metastasis
[22] and is related to poor patient
prognosis.[23] Comprehensive single-cell analysis of normal
and cirrhotic liver[18] showed that the expression ofNEDD9
was generally low in normal liver and expressed mainly in
endothelial and epithelial cells (Supplemental Figures S2A,
B, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A845). Interestingly,NEDD9-
expressing hepatocytes were substantially increased in the
cirrhotic liver compared with normal liver (Supplemental
Figures S2C–F, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A845).
Thus, gene expression profiling showed a significant
improvement in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and
fibrosis signaling by the administration of
L-carnitine;
histological improvements were observed in liver
inflammation, but not in steatosis and fibrosis (Figure 1).
Long-term L-carnitine administration
improves steatosis, inflammation, and
fibrosis in Ath+HFD MASH mice
We suspected that a 10-weekL-carnitine administration
may not be a long enough period to improve steatosis and
fibrosis in the liver. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of
long-term
L-carnitine administration on the liver using an
Ath+HFD MASH mouse model. An Ath+HFD containing
0.5% or 1%
L-carnitine was administered to C57BL/6J
mice for 20, 38, and 68 weeks, and liver histology was
compared with mice receiving a non-L-carnitine–contain-
ing Ath+HFD or control LFD (Figure 3A).
At 20 and 38 weeks, liver weight was significantly
increased in Ath+HFD mice compared with LFD mice, and
at 68 weeks, liver weight was substantially increased in
Ath+HFD mice (Figure 3B).
L-carnitine administration
reduced liver weight significantly. As for total body
weight, Ath+HFD increased body weight at 20 weeks,
but at 68 weeks, Ath+HFD decreased body weight
compared with an LFD (Figure 3C). Serum ALT levels
and liver triglyceride content significantly increased in
Ath+HFD mice, and
L-carnitine administration significantly
improved these values (Figures 3D, E).
Histological examination revealed that Ath+HFD subs-
tantially increased liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis
at 20 and 38 weeks, while L-carnitine improved liver
histology in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3F).
Interestingly,L-carnitine predominantly rescued pericentral
(zone 3) lesions (Figure 3F). Electron microscopy showed
the presence of swollen and broken mitochondria in the
liver of Ath+HFD mice, while L-carnitine rescued the
abnormal mitochondria, reflecting the reduction of
oxidative stress ( Figure 3G ). Immunohistochemical
staining ofα-smooth muscle actin and PDGF receptor-β
demonstrated a significant improvement in profibrosis
signaling by
L-carnitine (Figure 4A).
Correlated with these findings, quantitative real-time
detection-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expres-
sion of profibrosis genes such asActa2, Col1a2, Tgfb1,
Pdgfrb, Pdgf-b,a n dPdgf-c was significantly upregulated
in the liver of Ath+HFD mice, andL-carnitine significantly
suppressed the expression of these genes at 20, 38, and
68 weeks (Figure 4B). Similarly, for inflammation-related
genes, Tnfa, Il6, and Il1b mRNA expression was
significantly upregulated in the liver of Ath+HFD mice,
and
L-carnitine significantly suppressed the expression of
these genes at 20, 38, and 68 weeks (Figure 4B). For
lipid metabolism–related genes, Pparg mRNA expres-
sion was significantly upregulated in the liver of Ath+HFD
mice, and
L-carnitine effectively suppressed its expres-
sion, while Ppara expression was significantly down-
regulated in the liver of Ath+HFD mice, andL-carnitine
effectively rescued its expression (Figure 4B). These
results were concordant with those of recent reports
using hepatocyte-specific gene knockout mice showing
that Pparg accelerates MASH [24] and Ppara has
protective roles against MASH.[25]
L-Carnitine suppresses the development of
liver tumors in Ath+HFD MASH mice
Ath+HFD MASH model mice developed liver tumors at
68 weeks ( Figure 5A ); 79.2% of Ath+HFD mice
developed liver tumors (12 adenoma and 7 HCC out of
24 mice), while no tumors were observed in LFD mice
(p < 0.0001) (Figure 5B). The administration of 0.5%
L-carnitine significantly reduced the incidence of liver
tumors in Ath+HFD mice (38.5%; 7 adenoma and 3 HCC
out of 26 mice; p < 0.001), and 1%
L-carnitine also
reduced the incidence of liver tumors (16.7%; 4 adenoma
and 1 HCC out of 30 mice;p < 0.0001), although the
difference between 0.5% and 1% L-carnitine did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). Maximum tumor
diameter and the incidence of HCC were significantly
reduced by
L-carnitine administration (Figures 5C, D).
As NEDD9 was one of the top 5 genes downregulated
by L-carnitine administration in patient liver samples
(Figure 2C), we examinedNedd9 expression in Ath+HFD
mice (Figure 5E). Nedd9 expression was significantly
downregulated. Representative genes of each category and the top differentially expressed genes are listed on the right side of the heatmap. (B)

upregulated in the liver of Ath+HFD mice compared with
LFD mice and its expression was gradually increased
over the period of Ath+HFD feeding (~7-fold increase at
68 weeks). L-Carnitine administration significantly
repressed Nedd9 expression (Figure 5E).
Western blotting of whole liver lysates from Ath+HFD
mice confirmed the presence of the 2 differentially
phosphorylated forms of NEDD9 (p115 and p105,
respectively), as described.
[26] NEDD9 expression was
substantially increased in the liver of Ath+HFD mice
and was repressed byL-carnitine (Figure 5F). NEDD9
is a noncatalytic C10 regulator of kinase-associated
substrate family scaffolding protein that mediates the
function of many oncogenic proteins.
[27] NEDD9 protein
has a conserved NH2-terminal Src homology 3 domain
that binds to proteins containing polyproline motifs such
as FAK.
[27] NEDD9 and FAK regulate diverse cellular
processes, including growth factor signaling, cell
cycle progression, cell survival, cell motility, and
angiogenesis, through their kinase-dependent and
kinase-independent scaffolding functions. [28] p-FAK
levels were increased in the liver of Ath+HFD mice
and repressed by
L-carnitine (Figure 5F). Similarly,
p-AKT levels were increased in the liver of Ath+HFD
mice, while they were repressed by
L-carnitine
administration (Figure 5F).
L-Carnitine represses NEDD9/FAK/AKT
signaling in hepatocytes
We examined whether L-carnitine could repress
NEDD9/FAK/AKT signaling in hepatocytes. We first
confirmed the association of NEDD9, FAK, and AKT
signaling in HepG2 cells, a hepatoblastoma cell line.

RNA efficiently reduced the levels of p-FAK (Tyr397)
and p-AKT (Ser473) in HepG2 cells ( Figure 6A ).
Conversely, NEDD9 overexpression increased p-FAK
and p-AKT levels in HepG2 cells (Figure 6B). Thus,
NEDD9/FAK/AKT signaling was active in HepG2 cells.
Interestingly, we found that
L-carnitine treatment
reduced NEDD9 expression at the mRNA and protein
levels in HepG2 cells ( Figure 6C ). Following the
repression of NEDD9 expression, p-FAK and p-AKT
levels were reduced (Figure 6C).
TGF-β1 treatment significantly increased NEDD9
expression at the mRNA and protein levels in HepG2
cells (Figure 6D). We examined whether
L-carnitine
could repress the TGF- β1–induced expression of
N E D D 9i nH e p G 2c e l l s(Figure 6E ) and mouse
primary hepatocytes ( Figure 6F ). Although a high
concentration of L-carnitine was required to reduce
TGF-β1–induced NEDD9 expression in HepG2 cells
(160 μM), a low concentration of L-carnitine (from
40 μM) could repress TGF- β1–induced NEDD9
expression in mouse primary hepatocytes. Following
the repression of NEDD9, p-FAK, and p-AKT levels
were reduced in HepG2 cells and mouse primary
hepatocytes (Figures 6E, F).

L-Carnitine reduces NEDD9 expression by
regulating the expression of early growth
response 1
To examine the molecular mechanisms by which
L-carnitine reduced NEDD9 expression, we examined
the promoter region of NEDD9. Upstream regions (−500,
−1000, and−2000 bases) from the transcription start site
were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (pGL[−500],
pGL[−1000], and pGL[−2000], respectively) (Figure 7A).
Promoter activity was observed from all 3 constructs in
HepG2 cells, although pGL(−2000) showed less activity
than pGL(−500) and pGL(−1000) (Figure 7B). L-Carnitine
treatment significantly decreased promoter activity in all 3
constructs (Figure 7C), suggesting that a regulatory
region of
L-carnitine is present in pGL(−500). Therefore,
we searched the primary sequence up to 500 bases
upstream from the transcription start site and identified a
putative early growth response 1 (EGR1)-binding motif at
−218 to−226 bases (GCGT/GGGGCG) (Figure 7D). We
confirmed that EGR1 overexpression increased NEDD9
expression in HepG2 cells (Figure 7E). Interestingly,
when mutations were introduced into the EGR1-binding
motif, the promoter activity of pGL( −500) was
substantially decreased (Figures 7F, G ), suggesting
that EGR1 was required for the basal promoter activity
of NEDD9. EGR1 overexpression significantly increased
the promoter activity of pGL(−500), while it failed to
increase the promoter activity of pGL(−500) with EGR1-
binding motif mutations (Figure 7H).
We next examined the relationship between the
expression of TGF-β1 and EGR1. TGF-β1 treatment
significantly upregulated EGR1 mRNA expression in
HepG2 cells (Figure 7I). Interestingly, 160μM
L-carnitine
significantly reduced EGR1 expression ( Figure 7I ).
Immunofluorescence staining showed that TGF- β1
increased EGR1 expression; interestingly, the nuclear
accumulation of EGR1 was observed.
L-Carnitine
reduced the expression and nuclear accumulation of
EGR1 (Figure 7J).
A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that
L-carnitine reduced the amount of a chromatin region in
the promoter of NEDD9 (from−193 to−266) containing
the EGR1-binding motif (−218 to−226) that was pulled
down ( Figure 7K ). Quantitative measurement of
chromatin immunoprecipitation –precipitated DNA
revealed that a significantly lower amount of DNA was
pulled down from
L-carnitine–treated cells (Figure 7L)
(Supplemental Figure S3, http://links.lww.com/HC9/
A845).
These results showed that L-carnitine repressed
NEDD9 expression through the repression of EGR1
transcription and inhibition of the nuclear translocation
of EGR1.
DISCUSSION
MASH has emerged as a significant global health
concern, progressively supplanting viral hepatitis as the
primary cause of HCC. Despite its increasing preva-
lence, the prevention of MASH-derived HCC is a
substantial challenge due to the unique molecular and
metabolic features of MASH.
L-Carnitine, a vital human nutrient, is traditionally
recognized for its role in transferring long-chain fatty
acids to the mitochondrial matrix and subsequent
promotion of energy metabolism and ATP production
by activating the β-oxidation of fatty acids. Recent
research has highlighted its potential in ameliorating
various metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia,
[3]
hyperglycemia,[4] and obesity.[2]
Various clinical studies have been applied to
MASLD/MASH, and meta-analyses suggest thatL-car-
nitine treatment can significantly improve serum ALT
and AST levels as well as NAFLD activity scores in
patients with MASH.
[10] However, the molecular events
induced byL-carnitine in the liver of patients with MASH
have not been clarified comprehensively. In this study,
we demonstrated the changes in the hepatic gene
expression profiles of patients with MASH associated
with
L-carnitine administration for the first time. Although

L-CARNITINE PREVENTS MASH-DERIVED HCC | 13
(Figure 1 and Supplemental Table S1,http://links.lww.
com/HC9/A845). This might be due to the relatively
short period of L-carnitine administration, as the
hepatic gene expression profiles showed a substantial
improvement in inflammation-related and profibrotic-
related genes along with the recovery of lipid
metabolism–related genes (Figures 2 and 3). It was
noteworthy that
L-carnitine showed strong anti-
inflammatory effects rather than effects on lipid
metabolism (Figures 1 and 2and Supplemental Figure
S1, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A845). Previous reports
have demonstrated that
L-carnitine is involved in the
antioxidant effect against reactive oxygen species in
hepatocytes,
[29] proximal tubule epithelial cells, [30]
lens epithelial cells, [31] ovary cells, [32] and mouse
embryos.[33] L-Carnitine effectively diminishes H 2O2-
induced cell apoptosis [33] by stabilizing antioxidant
proteins such as superoxidase dismutase.[34] Funda-
mentally, L-carnitine increases fatty acid transfer into
mitochondria and stimulates fatty acid β-oxidation,
which potentially generates reactive oxygen species;
therefore, it could be assumed that
L-carnitine might
also be involved in reactive oxygen species removal
pathways. That might be one of the reasons why the
anti-inflammatory effects of L-carnitine were prominent
in this clinical study.
To evaluate the long-term effect of L-carnitine on
MASH, we took advantage of a MASH-HCC mouse
model, as reported.
[11,12] Although L-carnitine prevents
hepatocarcinogenesis in a Long-Evans Cinnamon rat
HCC model
[35] or STAM-HCC mouse model,[7] these
models are different from human MASH in terms of
genetic modification or lack of insulin resistance.[36] Ath
+HFD induces dyslipidemia, lipid peroxidation, and
stellate cell activation in the liver and finally causes
precirrhotic steatohepatitis after 24 weeks accompanied
by cellular ballooning and hepatic insulin resistance.
[19]
Furthermore, mice develop liver tumors at a high
frequency at 68 weeks.[11,12]
We found that long-term L-carnitine administration
substantially ameliorated the liver histology observed in
the Ath+HFD MASH mouse model. Liver inflammation,
steatosis, and fibrosis were significantly improved
(Figures 3 and 4 ), and at 68 weeks,
L-carnitine
significantly reduced the incidence of liver tumors
(Figure 5 ). This is the first report showing that
L-carnitine prevents hepatocarcinogenesis in a MASH
mouse model. Interestingly, L-carnitine predominantly
rescued zone 3 lesions ( Figure 3F ). Because β-
oxidation of fatty acids is more active in zone 1,
L-carnitine should rescue lesions in zone 1 rather than
in zone 3. The reasons whyL-carnitine rescued lesions
in zone 3 rather than in zone 1 in this study could not be
determined. However, the antioxidant redox signal was
found to be more active in zone 3,
[37] and the redox
signal might be induced by L-carnitine. The second
possibility is that a regeneration of the zone 3 area
might occur, given that L-carnitine is reported to
enhance liver regeneration. [38] Although Axin-2 –
positive progenitor cells in zone 3 had limited self-
renewal capacity, continuous cell death with HFD in
MUP (major mouse urinary protein) mice potentiated
zone 3 cell expansion.
[39]
As anL-carnitine target gene, we focused onNEDD9,
which was among the top 5 genes downregulated by
L-carnitine in the liver of patients with MASH (Figure 2).
NEDD9 is a C10 regulator of kinase-associated
substrate family scaffolding protein that mediates the
function of many oncogenic proteins.
[27] NEDD9
promotes oncogenic signaling in the development of
mammary tumors
[20] and ovarian cancer[21] and could
be an oncogenic driver in mouse liver tumor models.[40]
The NEDD9 mRNA and protein expression levels in
HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in
matched adjacent nontumor hepatic tissues, and
patients with high NEDD9 expression levels exhibited
poorer recurrence-free and overall survival than those
with low NEDD9 expression.
[23] NEDD9 associated with
FAK, which is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is
overexpressed and activated in many cancer types.
NEDD9 and FAK regulate diverse cellular processes,
including growth factor signaling, cell cycle progression,
cell survival, cell motility, and angiogenesis.
[28]
We found that Nedd9 expression was increased in
our mouse Ath+HFD MASH model and its expression
was gradually increased by up to ~7-fold at 68 weeks
(Figure 5E). The expression ofNEDD9 is generally low
in normal liver. Single-cell analysis using a public
database showed that NEDD9 was mainly expressed
in endothelial and epithelial cells in normal liver
(Supplemental Figures S2A, B, http://links.lww.com/
HC9/A845).
[18] Interestingly, NEDD9-expressing hepa-
tocytes were substantially increased in liver cirrhosis,
but its expression was not changed in endothelial cells
or cholangiocytes (Supplemental Figures S2C–F, http://
links.lww.com/HC9/A845). Therefore, the upregulation
of Nedd9 expression in the liver might be related to its
increased levels in hepatocytes, which are potentially
linked to the development of liver tumors.
L-Carnitine effectively reducedNedd9 expression in the
liver of Ath+HFD MASH mice ( Figure 5E), and in
concordance with NEDD9 expression, p-FAK and p-AKT
levels were increased in this model and reduced by
L-carnitine (Figure 5F). The correlation between NEDD9
and p-FAK and p-AKT was more clearly shown in
a hepatoblastoma-derived cell line (HepG2 cells)
(Figures 6A, B). Interestingly, we found that
L-carnitine
directly repressed NEDD9 expression in HepG2 cells
(Figure 6C). We also showed that
L-carnitine could reduce
TGF-β1–induced NEDD9 expression in HepG2 cells
(Figure 6E) and mouse primary hepatocytes (Figure 6F),
together with p-FAK and p-AKT levels.
We searched the promoter region of NEDD9 and
identified a putative EGR1-binding motif ( Figure 7).
14 | HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
Mutational analysis of the EGR1-binding motif showed the
functional importance of EGR1 on the basal expression of
NEDD9. EGR1 is an immediate early transcriptional factor
that acts as a coordinator of the complex response to stress
and is induced during liver injury. The association between
EGR1 and MASLD/MASH has been reported recently.
Egr1 is upregulated by insulin in hepatoma cells.
[41] Egr1-
deficient mice fed an HFD are less susceptible to diet-
induced obesity and obesity-associated disorders such as
insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and
fatty liver.
[42] Moreover, EGR1 regulates the expression of
many cholesterol biosynthetic genes.[43] Therefore, the
increased expression of NEDD9 through EGR1 observed
in this study would be applicable to other MASH models. In
fact, EGR1 expression was well correlated with the
progression or regression of liver fibrosis in our cohort of
serial biopsied MASH liver samples (data not shown).
[14] In
addition, we previously reported that EGR1 might be a key
regulator of the development of HCC in patients with chronic
hepatitis C.[44]
We showed that TGF- β1 treatment significantly
upregulated EGR1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells
(Figure 7I). Conversely, EGR1 reportedly stimulates
TGF-β1 expression through binding to the EGR1-
binding site in its promoter[45]; therefore, there might
be a positive feedback loop between TGF- β1 and
EGR1. Interestingly,L-carnitine significantly reduced the
TGF-β1–induced expression of EGR1 mRNA
(Figure 7I ), and further, it decreased the nuclear
accumulation and binding to the NEDD9 promoter of
EGR1 (Figures 7J–L). Although the effect ofL-carnitine
on EGR1 expression should be clarified in more detail,
these results revealed the direct effect of
L-carnitine on
NEDD9 expression through EGR1 (Figure 8).
This study has some limitations. First, L-carnitine
administration for 10 weeks resolved liver inflammation
but did not improve steatosis and fibrosis stage in
patients with MASH. An extended period of
L-carnitine
administration would be required to evaluate the real
effects of L-carnitine in preventing steatosis, fibrosis,
and the occurrence of liver tumors. Second, although
L-carnitine reduced the incidence of liver tumors in the
Ath+HFD MASH model, the effects of L-carnitine on
other MASH tumor models such as the gubra amylin
NASH diet-induced obese MASH-HCC (gubra amylin
NASH diet-induced obese-MASH-HCC) model
[46] still
need to be evaluated. The Ath+HFD MASH model
showed reduced body weight at a higher age (68 wk)
(Figure 3C), whereas the gubra amylin NASH diet-
induced obese-MASH model maintained body weight at
a higher age (72 wk).
[46]
In conclusion, we demonstrated that L-carnitine
potentially improved the pathophysiology of MASLD/
MASH and inhibited the subsequent development of
HCC. We showed that
L-carnitine directly inhibited one
of the NALFD/MASH-mediated oncogenic pathways,
EGR1/NEDD9/FAK/AKT. Further clinical trials with a
longer duration of
L-carnitine administration should be
conducted to demonstrate the proof of concept for the
clinical usage of
L-carnitine to prevent the progression of
MASLD/MASH to HCC.
