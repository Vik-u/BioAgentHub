Abstract 
Background: The critical issue in the competitiveness between bioengineering and chemical engineering is the 
products titer and the volume productivity. The most direct and effective approach usually employs high-density 
biocatalyst, while the weakened mass transfer and evoked foam problem accompany ultrahigh-density biocatalyst 
loading and substrate/product titer. In high-density obligate aerobic bioconversion, oxygen as electron acceptor is a 
speed-limiting step in bioprocesses, but sufficient oxygen supply will lead to the foaming which results in a significant 
reduction in oxygen utilization and the use of additional defoamers. In this study, we designed a novel sealed-oxygen 
supply (SOS) biotechnology to resolve the formidable barrier of oxygen transferring rate (OTR), for bio-based fuels and 
chemical production process.
Results: Based on systemic analysis of whole-cell catalysis in Gluconobacter oxydans, a novel sealed-oxygen supply 
technology was smartly designed and experimentally performed for biocatalytic oxidation of alcohols, sugars and so 
on. By a simple operation skill of automatic online supply of oxygen in a sealed stirring tank bioreactor of SOS, OTR 
barrier and foaming problem was resolved with great ease. We finally obtained ultrahigh-titer products of xylonic acid 
(XA), 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HPA), and erythrulose at 588.4 g/L, 69.4 g/L, and 364.7 g/L, respectively. Moreover, the 
volume productivity of three chemical products was improved by 150–250% compared with normal biotechnology. 
This SOS technology provides a promising approach to promote bioengineering competitiveness and advantages 
over chemical engineering.
Conclusion: SOS technology was demonstrated as an economic and universally applicable approach to bio-based 
fuels and chemicals production by whole-cell catalysis. The novel technology greatly promotes the competitiveness 
of bioengineering for chemical engineering, and provides a promising platform for the green and environmental use 
of biofuels.

industrial application of biotechnology as compared with 
chemical engineering [2]. The critical issue in the com -
petitiveness between bioengineering and chemical engi -
neering is products titer and volume productivity [3]. 
The most direct and effective approach usually employs 
high-density biocatalyst [4], while the weakened mass 
transfer [5] and evoked foam problem inevitably accom
-
pany ultrahigh-density biocatalyst loading and substrate/
product titer [6]. With the increasing demand for organic 
acids, whose global market share is only second to anti
-
biotics and amino acids, the scale of whole-cell catalytic 
industry of aerobic microorganisms is increasing rapidly. 
However, to achieve the high-cell density and ultrahigh 
titer, whole-cell catalysis encounters several limiting fac
-
tors such as oxygen transfer rate, foaming, and viscos -
ity [7]. Thus, the industry of aerobic microorganisms is 
sending out ‘SOS’ to the society. The aerobic microorgan
-
isms applied in the industrial bioprocesses require large 
amounts of molecular oxygen as electron acceptor at the 
terminus of the cell respiratory electron transfer system 
[8], and re-oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH) and/or flavin adenine dinucleotide 
(FADH) in electron transfer process to release abundant 
metabolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for cell mainte
-
nance, growth and catalytic reaction [9]. In bioprocesses, 
sufficient oxygen can effectively enhance catalytic effi
-
ciency and ensure the normal progress of reactions of 
aerobic microorganisms [10]. On the contrary, inad
-
equate oxygen supply can severely inhibit regular cell 
growth and metabolism. Oxygen is an insoluble gas and 
thus, its solubility in water is low under normal condi
-
tions. Also, due to the complex and variable composi -
tion of culture in bioprocesses, the solubility of oxygen in 
broth is generally low than 0.21 mmol/L [11]. Moreover, 
the dissolved oxygen (DO) level is insufficient to support 
the effective transfer of oxygen between gas–liquid and 
solid–liquid phases in the broth [12]. Since there is mini
-
mal difference between saturated solubility and actual 
solubility of oxygen in the liquid phase, this implies 
shortage in the concentration difference of oxygen 
transfer rate (OTR). If oxygen is not added to the broth 
in time, the DO can maintain the normal physiological 
and biochemical functions of cells for only 15–20 s [13]. 
Therefore, ensuring an oxygen-enriched environment in 
the broth is a strict requirement for aerobic microorgan
-
isms [14].
Microbial respiration can utilize DO in the broth only 
to supply life activities or metabolic demands. Thus, 
strengthening OTR will be conducive to the improve
-
ment of DO level [15]. It is necessary to meet the high 
demand for oxygen by aerobic microorganisms through 
timely oxygen supply technology. Additionally, OTR is 
proportional to the oxygen transfer coefficient and the 
oxygen driving force [16]. The volumetric oxygen trans
-
fer coefficient of liquid phase represents the efficiency 
of oxygen transfer from gas phase to liquid phase, which 
means the difficulty of oxygen transfer. It determines the 
quality or adaptability of the basic design skills of the bio
-
reactor involved in the regulation of microbial DO supply 
in the process of oxygen-consuming biological reaction 
[17]. The factors affecting oxygen transfer efficiency 
include stirring speed, air velocity, physical and chemical 
properties of the broth, foaming, structure design of the 
bioreactor, etc. For oxygen driving force, it represents the 
difference between saturated DO and actual DO in broth. 
The factors affecting oxygen driving force include tem
-
perature, properties of solutions, oxygen partial pressure, 
viscosity and so on [18]. Traditionally, the creation of an 
oxygen-enriched environment, which aims at enhancing 
OTR, mainly depends on the direct introduction of oxy
-
gen instead of air into the bioreactor [19]. However, unre-
stricted large-scale supply of pure oxygen not only leads 
to extremely low oxygen utilization, resulting in waste 
of resources and sharp increase in production costs, 
but also causes irreversible foam problem, which makes 
the timely updation of fresh gas difficult, and ultimately 
inhibiting microbial basal metabolism [20]. Moreover, 
several techniques have been employed in the bioreactor 
for strengthening OTR including elevated partial pres
-
sures of oxygen supplies [21], increased agitation rate 
[22], and modifying the vessel [23]. Additionally, it is 
feasible to add some oxygen carriers with high solubility 
to the broth. Irrespective of the operation, circumspect 
explorations are needed to prevent a severe condition 
from causing fatal damage to the relatively fragile micro
-
organisms. Therefore, by supplementing the oxygen 
needed for aerobic respiration for microbial growth and 
metabolism, i.e., to maintain the balance between oxygen 
supply and consumption, we can effectively and econom
-
ically improve the level of microbial transformation and 
fermentation.
In the whole-cell catalytic process of aerobic micro
-
organisms, DO in the broth tends to be zero when OTR 
cannot meet the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) [24]. Con
-
sequently, DO cannot satisfy the respiratory intensity of 
the microorganisms, which results in the cells being in 
a suppressed and oppressed state. Hence, oxygen is the 
core element for aerobic microorganisms [25]. Based on 
these limitations and considering the cost economy and 
the rationality of industrial production, we improved 
the conventional bioreactor and designed a sealed oxy
-
gen supplied bioreactor (SOS-BR). For SOS-BR, a 99.9% 
pure oxygen cylinder, instead of air compressor, is con
-
nected to a stirred bioreactor to strengthen the oxy -
gen driving force. Furthermore, a barometer is installed 
at the outlet and the tank pressure is controlled in the 
Page 3 of 12
Hua et al. Biotechnol Biofuels            (2020) 13:1 
range of 0.03–0.05 MPa. The SOS-BR has several advan -
tages including oxygen enrichment in the environment, 
high utilization rate of oxygen, and large partial pressure 
of oxygen. Bacterial strain Gluconobacter oxydans (G. 
oxydans) is a typical obligatory aerobic Gram-negative 
microorganism [26, 27]. Due to its strict regioselectivity 
and stereoselectivity incomplete oxidation, it has been 
widely employed in large-scale industrialized prepara
-
tion of various biochemical products [28]. Additionally, 
G. oxydans processes a series of membrane-bound dehy
-
drogenases, including four enzymes: ethanol dehydroge -
nase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, 
and glucose dehydrogenase [27]. The function of these 
dehydrogenases is to bio-convert alcohol and aldehyde 
substrates to corresponding ketones or acids. G. oxy
-
dans has been used in the synthesis of glycolic acid [29, 
30], 1,3-dihydroxyacetone [31], sorbose [32], and several 
sugar acids [33, 34]. Incomplete oxidizing strains, such 
as G. oxydans and Gluconobacter frateurii do not gener
-
ate waste gas  (CO2) in the physiological and biochemical 
processes. Hence, incomplete oxidized aerobic microor -
ganisms are in line with the SOS-BR operation model and 
can be operated continuously for a long time. For other 
aerobic microorganisms, even if small levels of  CO
2 are 
produced during the bioprocess, the whole-cell catalysis 
in SOS-BR can be achieved as long as the gas pressure 
in the tank is controlled in a safe range by intermittent 
ventilation. In this paper, G. oxydans is the representative 
strain used to investigate the economic practicability and 
universal applicability of SOS-BR to aerobic microorgan
-
isms. The modified operation bioreactor provides a valu -
able reference to promote cost-effective production by 
oxygen consumption biocatalysis in factories.
Results and discussion
Design SOS system based on systemic analysis 
of whole‑cell catalysis of G. oxydans
Oxygen is the linchpin dynamics of oxidation reaction 
in the process of G. oxydans biocatalytic conversion to 
organic acid. Therefore, improving the mass transfer 
capacity of oxygen greatly contributes to catalytic oxida
-
tion. Moreover, in order to highlight the superiority of 
SOS-BR, we increased the initial cell inoculation quantity 
to 20 OD (190  g/L wet weight) which is the maximum 
conventional industry access quantity. Under these con
-
ditions, the whole-cell catalysis of G. oxydans was carried 
out in three bioreactors as shown in Fig.  1. However, in 
order to meet the requirements of 20 OD for industrial 
production, AS-BR could not satisfy the oxygen demand 
of cells. Apart from that, due to the high concentration 
of sugar in the reaction process, the viscosity of broth 
increased rapidly, thus making it difficult to eliminate the 
bubbles.
Conventionally, replacing air with pure oxygen is the 
quickest and simplest approach to maintain absolute 
oxygen-enriched conditions in a bioreactor. Although 
the DO level in this device was sufficient to sustain the 
aerobic demand of the cells, there were still two fatal 
obstacles. First, due to the continuous and uninter
-
rupted oxygen supply, the utilization rate of oxygen was 
extremely low, which is not practical. Also, pure oxygen 
is expensive, a large amount of oxygen consumption will 
lead to a significant increase in production expenses, 
which is not economic. Second, the foaming issue is still 
inevitable, as the bubbles are hard to break and oxygen 
rises through the bubbles to the gas–liquid interface and 
released into the air. The most direct technique to solve 
this problem is to add an appropriate amount of defoam
-
ing agent. However, defoaming agents are not only 
expensive, but also affect the purity of the product, which 
is not suitable for large-scale industrial production.
Conversely, SOS-BR could conquer these defects. In 
SOS-BR, when the pressure in the tank reached the con
-
trol interval, it indicated that there is enough oxygen in 
the bioreactor. At this time, the oxygen flow was com
-
pressed, and the oxygen utilization rate increased to over 
90% while maintaining enough oxygen. When the micro
-
organisms used oxygen quickly, the inlet ventilation flow 
was compensated accordingly. When the oxygen con
-
sumption rate was slow, the inlet ventilation flow was 
weakened correspondingly. This control model greatly 
debases the production cost and ensures full utilization 
of resources. Additionally, increasing the tank pressure 
will reduce the volume of bubbles, effectively restraining 
the formation of foam, and completely eliminating the 
bubble problem. Thus, SOS-BR is a flawless biotechnol
-
ogy technique to promote the industrialization of aerobic 
microorganisms.
SOS performances in bio‑oxidation of various 
oxy‑compounds
Gluconobacter oxydans consists of four main enzymes: 
ethanol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, 
glycerol dehydrogenase, and aldose dehydrogenase. 
Therefore, we chose 1,3-PG [35] and erythritol [36] as 
raw materials, which covered the main enzymes system 
of G. oxydans besides aldose dehydrogenase, and tested 
the practicability and universality of SOS-BR.
There are no reports on the preparation of 3-HPA by 
microorganism due to the toxicity of the substrates. The 
highest yield of 3-HPA was obtained by using genetic 
modification of K. pneumoniae. With K. pneumoniae 
DSM 2026 as catalyst, the maximum production of 
3-HPA in one single batch was 83.8 g/L for 72 h, but the 
yield was only 1.2 g/L/h [37]. Moreover, using K. pneumo
-
niae WM3, the maximum yield of 3-HPA was 2.0 g/L/h,

Hua et al. Biotechnol Biofuels            (2020) 13:1 
but the production was only 48.9  g/L [38]. However, 
SOS-BR, a promising biotechnology technique can sig -
nificantly increase both production and productivity of 
3-HPA. As is shown in Fig.  2, in 24-h whole-cell cataly
-
sis, 67.7 g/L and 2.8 g/L/h 3-HPA was acquired, and the 
productivity exceeded the current highest level by about 
40%. As for the one batch production, although 3-HPA 
production was less than 83.8 g/L, the fermentation time 
of the entire batch was 72 h, much longer than the 24 h 
of the catalysis using G. oxydans. In terms of produc
-
tivity, there was significant difference between the two 
methods, and the results in SOS-BR were high by about 
133.3%.
The bioconversion of erythritol involves mainly the 
membrane-bound glycerol dehydrogenase of G. oxydans, 
and its catalytic end-product is erythrulose. Erythrulose, 
a natural 4-C ketose whose aldose form is erythrose, is 
often used in the cosmetics industry, as a substitute anti-
allergic to 1,3-dihydroxyacetone because its structure 
is similar to dihydroxyacetone. As is shown in Fig.  3, 
the production and productivity of erythrulose reached 
354.7  g/L and 14.8  g/L/h after 24  h of whole-cell fed-
batch catalysis. The catalytic results were 46.6% higher 
than that of Christian Burger et al. which was the high
-
est level. Interestingly, in SOS-BR, the end titer of eryth -
rulose exceeded the inhibitory concentration (about 
250 g/L).
Through the regulation of SOS-BR, independent of the 
kind of membrane-bound dehydrogenase of G. oxydans 
used, the ultrahigh-titer end products could be obtained 
and the efficient utilization of oxygen could be guaran
-
teed at the same time. Additionally, the oxygen-enriched 
environment of SOS-BR could break through the con
-
ventional inhibitory concentration of some products. 
Thus, both 1,3-PG and erythritol illustrate the utility and 
universality of SOS-BR.
Comparison of physical parameters and bioreaction 
kinetics between typical bioconversion technologies
Xylonic acid (XA) is mainly derived from a one-step oxi -
dation reaction of xylose and XA has been identified as 
one of 30 most promising compounds in biomass refin -
ing by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 
and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNL) under 
the U.S. Department of Energy. Precisely, G. oxydans is 
an excellent microbe for the bioproduction of XA from 
xylose [39]. Moreover, XA is a typical high value-added 
product of G. oxydans, and its catalytic process involves 
the cells’ membrane-bound aldose dehydrogenase, which 
combined with 1,3-PG and erythritol, includes all the 
major enzymes of G. oxydans. Hence, the whole-cell 
catalysis of xylose in bioreactors with different aeration 
models was carried out and the entire bioprocess was 
reviewed and compared in detail. Biotransformation

profiles of xylose in AS-BR, OS-BR, and SOS-BR are 
shown in Fig. 4.
As can be seen from Fig.  4a, a total production of 
255.8  g XA and the volume productivity of 10.7  g/L/h 
were achieved by 24-h whole-cell catalysis in AS-BR. 
However, in the whole bioprocess, expect for the rebound 
of DO, when the substrate was depleted, the DO level 
could only be limited to less 10%, which was far below

the critical DO level of G. oxydans and could not guar -
antee its normal physiological and catalytic functions. As 
shown in Fig. 4b, the oxygen driving force was only 0.22–
0.23 mmol  O2/L under ventilation, and the initial maxi -
mum OTR was 62.7 mmol  O2/L/h. When the viscosity of 
the broth in AS-BR increased to 2.2 mPa s, the DO level 
dropped to 5%, that severely inhibited the overall metab -
olism of cells. Visibly, the normal ventilation condition 
was far from propping up the regular demand of oxygen 
for high-density whole-cell catalysis. Afterwards, we per
-
formed 24-h continuous catalysis in OS-BR under oxy -
gen-enriched atmosphere for the sake of remedying the 
restrictive bottleneck. As shown in Fig.  4c, within 24  h, 
the production and productivity of XA increased sig
-
nificantly to 610.2 g/L and 25.4 g/L/h and DO level also 
increased to 24–26% (20–30% of high-efficiency produc
-
tion level). Moreover, the oxygen driving force height -
ened to 1.23–1.25  mmol  O2/L and OTR also increased 
to 143.1  mmol  O2/L/h. However, the oxygen consump -
tion increased linearly throughout the bioprocess, with a 
total consumption of 32.2 mol and an oxygen utilization 
rate of only 5.3%. Moreover, because the titer of the end-
product was more than 600 g/L, the viscosity was high at 
4.5 mPa s, increasing the severity of the foam issue. Faced 
with microbial ‘SOS’ , we repeated the whole-cell catalysis 
of XA with SOS-BR. In a 24-h profile, the accumulation 
and productivity of XA was 580.1  g/L and 24.2  g/L/h. 
The other properties, including viscosity, oxygen driving 
force, and OTR, were similar to OS-BR. Only 1.74  mol 
 O
2 in the aggregate was consumed within 24  h and the 
oxygen utilization rate of oxygen was up to 92.6%.
As shown in Table  1, AS-BR was inferior to OS-BR 
and SOS-BR, which highlighted the importance of oxy -
gen for aerobic microorganisms. For the two bioreac -
tor models in oxygen-enriched environment, although 
the production and productivity of SOS-BR was slightly 
lower than OS-BR by 3.6%, the oxygen consumption was 
saved by 18.5 times and the utilization rate increased by 
16.5 times. Furthermore, in SOS-BR, with the increase 
in oxygen partial pressure, the foam could be squeezed 
and crushed in the broth, and released oxygen, which 
improved the utilization rate of oxygen, and fundamen
-
tally solved the foam issue. In conclusion, SOS-BR is an 
excellent bioreactor to overcome the shortcomings of 
aerobic microorganisms with high-quality utilization of 
oxygen.
Applicability and superiority of SOS‑BR for liquid–solid 
mass transfer
The above experiments on SOS-BR were based on the 
mass transfer between gas and liquid phase. However, 
in fact, most of biological products used in industrial 
production are prepared by cell immobilization technol
-
ogy. Hence, to fully explain the excellence of SOS-BR, it 
was necessary to study the liquid–solid transfer along 
with the gas–liquid mass transfer. Figure  5 shows that 
the whole-cell catalysis was conducted in the bioreactor 
operation models of SOS-BR with immobilized G. oxy
-
dans using sodium alginate.
As is shown in Fig.  6, the comparison of whole-cell 
catalysis reactions performed in AS-BR, OS-BR, and 
SOS-BR were investigated. Within 24  h of continuous 
catalysis, 190.6  g/L, 281.2  g/L, and 292.1  g/L XA were 
accumulated in three bioreactors with corresponding 
productivity of 7.9  g/L/h, 11.7  g/L/h, and 12.2  g/L/h, 
respectively. Noticeably, after the combined immobiliza
-
tion technology, the product concentration of the com -
pressed oxygen-supplied operation model was no longer 
lower than that of the direct pure-oxygen model. It is 
speculated that the increase of oxygen partial pressure 
in SOS-BR made it easier for the nutrient factors such 
as substrates, nitrogen sources, and oxygen to be com
-
pressed to shuttle the immobilized carrier and contact 
cells to achieve efficient catalysis. The DO levels of free 
cells and immobilized cells in AS-BR during whole-cell 
catalysis were monitored and compared. It was found 
that under the same inoculation and ventilation condi
-
tions, the DO level of the immobilized cells was much 
higher than that of free cells. This did not imply that the 
DO level of immobilized cells had reached efficient cata
-
lytic values, but the immobilized carrier restricted the 
use of DO in the broth by G. oxydans, increasing DO in 
the broth, which highlighted the importance and neces
-
sity of compressed pressure technology in SOS-BR. In 
addition to investigating the effect of pressurization on 
mass transfer, it was necessary to evaluate whether SOS-
BR could damage the immobilized carrier. Therefore, we 
selected the most conventional immobilization mode,

sodium alginate immobilization technology, to consider 
the loss of cells. Under normal air or oxygen stirring con-
ditions, the cell retention rate of 24-h whole-cell catalysis 
was about 93.5%, while the cell retention rate of SOS-
BR was insignificantly different, about 92.6%, indicating 
that the strengthening of oxygen partial pressure had no 
influence on the conventional immobilized carrier. The 
outcome showed that SOS-BR could achieve significant 
mass transfer effect in gas–liquid–solid phases, which 
could effectively enhance the production capacity while 
ensuring high-quality utilization of oxygen and inhibition 
of foam.
Conclusions
In the field of chemical engineering, this sealed-oxygen 
supply bioconversion strategy seems to be a kind of SOS 
slogan to promote biotech and bioengineering develop
-
ments and industrial applications. The design of SOS-
BR could not only enhance the oxygen driving force and 
OTR, but also solve the foaming issue, thus overcoming 
the bottleneck of microorganisms in industrial produc
-
tion. Using this biotechnology, high-efficiency of catalysis 
and high-quality utilization of oxygen has been achieved 
using G. oxydans as catalyst. Finally, the biotechnology of 
modified bioreactor demonstrates an efficient, pragmatic, 
and stable biotechnology model, which provides a cost-
effective approach for industrialized bio-based fuels and 
chemical production of aerobic microorganisms.
Materials and methods
Microorganism
Gluconobacter oxydans NL71 strain (derived from 
ATCC621) was stored on sorbitol-agar culture medium 
containing 50  g/L sorbitol, 15  g/L agar, and 5  g/L yeast 
extract at 4 °C. G. oxydans was germinated in a 250-mL 
Erlenmeyer flask with three baffles containing 50  mL 
nutrient medium (100  g/L sorbitol and 10  g/L yeast 
extract) and cultivated in a constant temperature shaker 
at 30  °C and 220  rpm for 24–36  h. Bacteria were har

Beckman Coulter) at 8000 rpm for 5–10 min as a reserve 
[6].
Whole‑cell catalysis
The whole-cell catalysis bioprocesses were conducted in 
a 3.0-L bioreactor (New Brunswick BioFlo 115) including 
1 L of culture medium composed of 5 g/L yeast extract,

-
lated at 3 vvm. For OS-BR, pure oxygen (Purity ≥ 99.9%) 
was fed into the bioreactor with an oxygen cylinder 
replacing the air compressor, and the ventilation rate 
was controlled at 0.5 vvm. SOS-BR was connected to 
an exhaust valve similar to OS-BR. The pressure of the 
tank was adjusted at 0.03–0.05  MPa. The pressure and 
the oxygen consumption rate of microorganisms in the 
bioreactor directly determined the oxygen inflow rate. 
Foaming was monitored by on-line addition of polyeth
-
ylene as an antifoam agent in AS-BR and OS-BR, but not 
in SOS-BR [41].
Immobilization operation of G. oxydans
The immobilized carrier was prepared using 3% sodium 
alginate dissolved in super-clean water assisted by mag
-
netic stirring at 70 °C for 1–2 h. Then, the fully dissolved 
sodium alginate colloid was sterilized in autoclave at 
121 °C for 15 min and stored at 4 °C [42]. Prepared bio
-
mass of 20  OD600 G. oxydans was aseptically washed into 
sodium alginate colloid using sterile water. Mixed col -
loid containing G. oxydans was transported by a peristal -
tic pump to drop the beads into the cross-linking agent, 
containing 3.5% calcium chloride, automatically with a 
needle barrel with a diameter of 2–3  mm. Afterwards, 
the cross-linking agent containing immobilized beads 
were preserved at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Finally, the cross-linked 
immobilized beads were washed with deionized water to 
remove residual calcium chloride and unfixed bacteria on 
the surface of the carrier and stored in distilled water at 
4 °C for further use.
Determination of parameters in whole‑cell catalytic 
process
Oxygen consumption (mol) was calculated by the pres -
sure in the oxygen cylinder. The formula is as follows:
where V (L) represents the actual gas volume consump -
tion in oxygen cylinders; V 0 (L) represents the total 
volume in oxygen cylinder (40 L); G1 and G 2 (MPa) rep -
resent real-time pressure in oxygen cylinder before and 
(1)V = (G2 − G1 ) × V0 × g
1000 ,
(2)n = V
22.4 ,
after whole-cell catalysis, and g (m/s 2) represents gravity 
acceleration (9.8 m/s2).
OTR (mmol  O2/h/L) is oxygen transfer rate between 
gas–liquid and liquid–solid phase in the broth. The for -
mula is as follows:
where C* (mmol/L) is the saturated concentration of dis -
solved oxygen in broth (mmol/L) and  CL (mmol/L) is 
actual dissolved oxygen concentration in broth; C * − CL 
represents the driving force of oxygen concentration 
difference, and K Lα  (h−1) represents oxygen transfer 
coefficient.
OUR (mmol  O2/h/L) is oxygen uptake rate of cell reac -
tion system. The formula is as follows:
where qO2 (mmol/(g  h)) represents specific oxygen con -
sumption rate and C x (g/L) represents the biomass of G. 
oxydans.
Viscosity (mPa  s) was measured using a rheometer 
(Thermo Scientific HAAKE RheoStress6000).
Analytical methods
In whole-cell catalysis bioprocess, xylose, erythritol, 
1,3-propylene glycol (1,3-PG), and 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid (3-HPA) were obtained from Aladdin. Xylonic acid 
(XA) was purchased from TRC-Canada, erythrulose and 
yeast extract were procured from Sigma. All other chem
-
icals including nutrient salts and sodium alginate were of 
analytical grade and were commercially available.
The concentration of xylose and XA were detected 
by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography 
(HPAEC) coupled with pulsed amperometric detec
-
tor (Thermo ICS-5000). NaOH (100  mM) was used as 
mobile phase at flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The separation 
column used was CarboPac
™ PA200. The titer of eryth -
ritol, erythrulose, 1,3-PG and 3-HPA were measured by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agi
-
lent 1100 series) equipped with Carbohydrate  Ca++ 8um 
HyperRez XP Column and deionized water, after ultra -
sound, was used as mobile phase at 0.6 mL/min.
Five parallel assays were performed for each 
experiment.
