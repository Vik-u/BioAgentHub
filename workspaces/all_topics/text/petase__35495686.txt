Many marine bacteria produce extracellular enzymes that degrade complex molecules
to facilitate their growth in environmental conditions that are often harsh and low in
nutrients. Marine bacteria, including those inhabiting sea sponges, have previously
been reported to be a promising source of polyesterase enzymes, which have received
recent attention due to their potential ability to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
plastic. During the screening of 51 marine bacterial isolates for hydrolytic activities
targeting ester and polyester substrates, a Brachybacterium ginsengisoli B129SM11
isolate from the deep-sea sponge Pheronema sp. was identiﬁed as a polyesterase
producer. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA from strain B129SM11, coupled with
a genome “mining” strategy, allowed the identiﬁcation of potential polyesterases, using
a custom database of enzymes that had previously been reported to hydrolyze PET or
other synthetic polyesters. This resulted in the identiﬁcation of a putative PET hydrolase
gene, encoding a polyesterase-type enzyme which we named BgP that shared high
overall similarity with three well-characterized PET hydrolases—LCC, TfCut2, and
Cut190, all of which are key enzymes currently under investigation for the biological
recycling of PET. In silico protein analyses and homology protein modeling offered
structural and functional insights into BgP , and a detailed comparison with Cut190
revealed highly conserved features with implications for both catalysis and substrate
binding. Polyesterase activity was conﬁrmed using an agar-based polycaprolactone
(PCL) clearing assay, following heterologous expression of BgP in Escherichia coli .
This is the ﬁrst report of a polyesterase being identiﬁed from a deep-sea sponge
bacterium such as Brachybacterium ginsengisoli and provides further insights into
marine-derived polyesterases, an important family of enzymes for PET plastic hydrolysis.
Microorganisms living in association with sponges are likely to have increased exposure
to plastics and microplastics given the wide-scale contamination of marine ecosystems
with these plastics, and thus they may represent a worthwhile source of enzymes

INTRODUCTION
Marine microbial communities play a central role in maintaining
and supporting ocean ecosystems, largely by participating in
biogeochemical processes, such as carbon cycling (Arnosti
et al., 2014). Moreover, by harnessing their ability to catalyze
biological reactions, marine microorganisms can be used to
reduce environmental pollutants, as well as the damaging
eﬀects of industrial activities (Carr et al., 2020; de Oliveira
et al., 2020). Many marine enzymes oﬀer novel biocatalytic
properties, particularly when compared to those from terrestrial
environments, due to the diversity of conditions in which
they normally operate and the presence of unusual and often
bulky substrates with distinct chemical substituents in marine
ecosystems (Trincone, 2011, 2017; Parages et al., 2016).
The plastics era, which evolved alongside fast-paced, modern
lifestyles and transformative technological advancements, has
contributed to a major shift toward a society of mass production
and excess consumption. Over the past decade, 4.8–12.7 million
metric tons (MMT) of plastic has been reported to enter
the world’s oceans on an annual basis, a ﬁgure which could
accumulate to 250 MMT by 2025 (Y akimov et al., 2022).
The “plastisphere, ” which refers to the microbial communities
colonizing plastic debris, has attracted particular attention in
the context of marine ecosystems (Amaral-Zettler et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2021; Y akimov et al., 2022), with recent multi-omics
analyses on the plastisphere highlighting this habitat as a
promising source of plastic-degrading microorganisms (Suzuki
et al., 2021; Wright et al., 2021; Zrimec et al., 2021).
Plastics are as versatile and easy to produce as they
are problematic and diﬃcult to discard. Unlike the broadly
employed mechanical recycling methods that result in plastic
“downcycling, ” chemical and biological recycling processes aim
to facilitate virgin plastic production by recovering the original
monomers (Carr et al., 2020). Thus, biological-based methods
in plastic disposal or recycling strategies are gaining increased
attention (Bahl et al., 2021). These methods, which may be
either enzyme- or whole-cell catalyzed, are particularly attractive
as they oﬀer the possibility of comparatively mild reaction
conditions, high speciﬁcity, and reduced energy requirements
and greenhouse gas emissions, that are potentially more cost-
eﬀective when compared to chemical recycling (Carr et al., 2020;
Singh et al., 2021).
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a crude-oil derived
thermoplastic synthetic polyester, consisting of terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) monomers (Webb et al., 2013).
PET, which is currently the most abundantly used polyester
plastic in the world, has a predicted life span of up to 50 years
(Pirillo et al., 2021). Its widespread use across the packaging,
textile, automotive, electrical, and electronics sectors is primarily
related to its light weight and high mechanical strength, together
with its insulating properties, and capacity to act as both a gas and
moisture barrier (Webb et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019a; Dissanayake
and Jayakody, 2021). In particular, its durability and moldability
are convenient for the production of PET containers, ﬁlms,
and ﬁbers, together with bottles commonly used for carbonated
soft drinks and water. However, the aforementioned qualities
that make PET an attractive material for various industrial
applications are also responsible for the problems it can cause if
its disposal is mismanaged (Jaiswal et al., 2020). The backbone of
the PET polymer is highly stable, which together with its surface
hydrophobicity and crystallinity, restricts its natural breakdown
(Liu et al., 2019a; Kawai et al., 2020).
Microbial enzymes with PET depolymerizing activity have
however introduced the possibility of PET degradation or
modiﬁcation to allow the development of techno-economically
feasible, microbial-based PET recycling processes (Tournier
et al., 2020; Zimmermann, 2020). These PET-active enzymes
commonly belong to carboxylesterase, lipase, and cutinase
families (Danso et al., 2019), and to date have predominantly
been identiﬁed in thermophilic Actinobacteria, particularly
in the genus Thermobiﬁda (Silva et al., 2011; Wei and
Zimmermann, 2017). The best studied enzyme in this area is
a PET hydrolase or “PETase” from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6
(IsPETase), on the basis that the strain was isolated from a PET-
enriched environment and had potentially evolved speciﬁcally
to process PET. This enzyme was subsequently biochemically
and structurally characterized and adapted across a number of
studies, in an eﬀort to enhance its overall activity and stability
(Han et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2018; Liu et al.,
2019a; Urbanek et al., 2020).
Given the aforementioned studies highlighting the
plastisphere as a promising source of plastic-degrading
microorganisms, coupled with the fact that plastic constitutes
up to 90% of the solid waste found in oceans (Oliveira et al.,
2020); it is perhaps not surprising that microorganisms from
marine ecosystems and holobionts, such as marine sponges
and seaweeds, are likely to have been exposed to plastics or
microplastics in marine environments and can be targeted as a
potential source of PET-active enzymes. Our group has recently
reported on a PETase-like enzyme with polycaprolactone
(PCL)-degrading activity, which was identiﬁed in the marine
sponge-derived Streptomyces sp. SM14 strain (Almeida et al.,
2019). Additionally, a putative polyesterase named MorEst,
from an Antarctic psychrotrophic bacterium from the genus
Moraxella sp. has been reported to degrade a range of polyesters,
including PCL (Nikolaivits et al., 2020). Also, a novel polyester
hydrolase from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas aestusnigri

Carr et al. Marine Derived Cutinase-Like Polyesterase
with activity against PET ﬁlm has been reported which, following
mutagenesis, also displayed some activity against commercial
PET bottles (Bollinger et al., 2020). Furthermore, a study
of marine metagenomic datasets has reported that genes
encoding PET hydrolases are globally distributed in marine
environments (Danso et al., 2018; Zrimec et al., 2021). Thus,
marine microbiomes appear to be a potentially rewarding
source of novel polyesterase and PETase enzymes and given
the continued need to increase the diversity of enzymes and
microorganisms acting on artiﬁcial polyesters, may prove a
useful resource for these types of enzymes.
The deep sea, while one of the most vast biomes on our planet,
still remains relatively unexplored. This environment, deﬁned
by seawater depths below 1,000 m and averaging at 3,800 m, is
considered extreme; given its challenging physical conditions and
unique composition (Jin et al., 2019). The microbial communities
that can survive and thrive in the deep sea face a dynamic
range of pressure, temperature, pH, and salinity, together with
exposure to various chemicals and metals. The production of
enzymes that tolerate these parameters contribute to the adaptive
strategy of these microorganisms, and so the deep sea represents a
promising source of stable and robust enzymes for industrial use
(Jin et al., 2019). Furthermore, marine microbial communities
and their hydrolytic enzymes may interact with synthetic polymer
debris, within these ecosystems (Galloway et al., 2017). Plastic
particles have been detected in deep-sea ecosystems, such as in
Western Paciﬁc Ocean sediment at depths between 4,601 and
5,732 m, where the most abundant microplastics were found to
be poly(propylene-ethylene) copolymer (PP-PE) and PET (Zhang
et al., 2020). It is worth noting that, although the ability to
hydrolyze PET could potentially enhance the evolutionary ﬁtness
of microorganisms in the environment, this would require that
PET is fully metabolized. In the case of the aforementioned
Ideonella sakaiensis, the role of bioﬁlms and microbial consortia,
together with a dedicated PET metabolic pathway, have been
explored to provide an explanation for its ability to grow on PET
as a sole carbon source (Taniguchi et al., 2019; Carr et al., 2020).
Following the screening of a number of marine sponge-
derived bacterial isolates, with lipolytic activity that was initially
observed on tributyrin agar, and with polyesterase activity
subsequently being conﬁrmed on polycaprolactone diol (PCD)
and polycaprolactone (PCL) agar plates; a Brachybacterium
ginsengisoli B129SM11 strain isolated from the deep-sea sponge
Pheronema sp. which had been sampled at a depth of
2,129 m, was prioritized for further analyses. Genome mining
of the B129SM11 strain revealed a putative PETase gene
which, following computational protein analyses and homology
modeling, was shown to encode a cutinase-like enzyme, named
BgP. Polyesterase activity was subsequently conﬁrmed on ester
and polyester substrates, following cloning and heterologous
expression of BgP in Escherichia coli.
Cutinases and cutinase-like enzymes have become the focus
of a number of polyester and PET hydrolysis studies, and are
considered versatile biocatalysts with several uses, which are
not limited to waste treatment and biorecycling, but also have
other biotechnological applications, for example, in sustainable
chemical synthesis, polymerization, and polymer modiﬁcation
(Chen et al., 2013; Nikolaivits et al., 2018; Molitor et al., 2020).
This is the ﬁrst report of a cutinase-like polyesterase being
identiﬁed in a deep-sea sponge-derived Brachybacterium spp.
isolate and this work provides further insight into enzymes for
polyester degradation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sponge Sampling and Isolation of
Bacterial Strains
The R.V. Celtic Explorer Irish research vessel and Holland
I remotely operated vehicle (ROV) were employed for the
collection of the marine sponge Pheronema sp., from the North
Atlantic Ocean in the Irish Rockall Trough. The sponge sample
was obtained from a depth of 2,129 m as part of a biodiscovery
cruise in 2010. Following collection, sponge samples were rinsed
with sterile artiﬁcial seawater (ASW) [Instant Ocean TM, 3.33%
(w/v)], macerated with a sterile razor blade, then placed in a
tube with sterile glass beads and vortexed for 2 min. Sterile ASW
was added, and samples were vortexed again. Dilution series
were performed to 10−5 with sterile ASW and microbial cultures
were isolated by spread plating 100 µL of each dilution onto
the following growth media; (i) starch-yeast-peptone seawater
agar (SYP-SW): 1% (w/v) starch, 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.2%
(w/v) peptone, 3.33% (w/v) artiﬁcial sea salts (Instant Ocean TM),
1.5% (w/v) agar; (ii) modiﬁed marine agar (MMA): 0.005%
(w/v) yeast extract, 0.05% (w/v) tryptone, 0.01% (w/v) β-glycerol
phosphate disodium salt, pentahydrate, 3.33% (w/v) artiﬁcial sea
salts (Instant OceanTM), 1.5% (w/v) agar, and (iii) chitin agar: 4%
(v/v) colloidal chitin, 1.5% (w/v) agar.
Enzyme Activity Screening
As part of a wider polyesterase screening study investigating
51 strains from a variety of marine sources, isolate B129SM11
from Pheronema sp. sponge was tested for enzyme activities
against the following substrates: tributyrin (glyceryl tributyrate,
Sigma Aldrich), polycaprolactone diol (PCD, Sigma Aldrich),
and polycaprolactone (PCL, Sigma Aldrich), using agar-based
clearing assays previously detailed in Molitor et al. (2020), with
the following adaptations; marine agar (3.74% Marine Broth
2216, BD Difco TM; 1.5% agar, Sigma) was supplemented with
tributyrin (1.0%), PCD (3.0%), or PCL (0.1%). A Waring
R⃝
laboratory blender was used to emulsify the tributyrin and PCD
substrates with the media before autoclaving. PCL pellets were
dissolved in acetone at 70 ◦C before adding dropwise, under fast
stirring to autoclaved agar. Cultures were spot inoculated onto
screening plates and incubated at 28 ◦C, then checked daily for
zones of clearing for up to 7 days. Based on the observed activities,
conﬁrmed 16S rRNA gene identities, and considering its deep-sea
origin, Brachybacterium ginsengisoli B129SM11 was subsequently
selected as a suitable candidate for genome sequencing (Table 1).
Genomic DNA Extraction
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 5 mL cultures
grown in Marine Broth 2216 for 24 h at 30 ◦C, with shaking

(125 rpm). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (Eppendorf
Centrifuge 5804R) at 4400 xg for 20 min, then broth supernatants
were discarded, and cell pellets were allowed to drain. The
method used to obtain gDNA from isolate B129SM11 was based
on a previously described phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol
extraction procedure (Jackson et al., 2018).
Genome Sequencing, Assembly, and
Annotation
Next-generation sequencing was completed by Euroﬁns
Genomics (Konstanz, Germany) using Illumina HiSeq
technology (NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system), including
library preparation and initial quality checks. FastQC (v 0.11.9) 1
was used to evaluate the quality of the raw sequence reads. Reads
were then assembled de novo using SPAdes Genome Assembler
(v 3.15.0) (Bankevich et al., 2012), excluding contigs <400 bp.
QUAST (v 5.0.2) (Gurevich et al., 2013) was employed to assess
the overall quality of the ﬁnal assembly, and completeness and
contamination were determined using CheckM (v 1.1.3) (Parks
et al., 2015). Initial annotation was completed using Prokka
(v 1.14.6) (Seemann, 2014), while functional annotation of the
predicted protein output was carried out with eggNOG mapper
(v 2.0), against the eggNOG database (v 5.0) (Huerta-Cepas et al.,
2019), and with the BLASTKOALA (KEGG Orthology And Links
Annotation) tool using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes) database (Kanehisa et al., 2016). The Genome
Database Taxonomy Toolkit (GTDB-Tk, v 1.5.0) was applied for
phylogenomic analyses, operating based on an established set of
single-copy conserved marker genes (Chaumeil et al., 2020).
Genome Mining
A reference dataset, containing the amino acid sequences of
26 PET hydrolases and homologous polyesterases, was used
to produce a custom BLASTP database with the makeblastdb
command-line tool ( Table 2), following a previously described
strategy for genome mining (Almeida et al., 2019). Potential
homologs were identiﬁed in the genome of B129SM11 by
performing a BLASTP search of the annotated Prokka output
against the constructed database, employing an e-value threshold
of 1e-30. The speciﬁc homology search results generated for BgP
with three well-studied PET-hydrolyzing cutinases are presented
in Table 3.
Protein Analysis and Homology Modeling
Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences was carried out using
the MEGA-X program (Kumar et al., 2018) with the maximum
likelihood statistical method and the WAG +G model, under
100 bootstrap replications and a 50% bootstrap cut-oﬀ value.
T-COFFEE Expresso (Di Tommaso et al., 2011) was employed
to generate amino acid sequence alignments, and outputs were
graphically represented and analyzed using ESPript 3.0 (Gouet
et al., 1999). The Lipase Engineering Database (LED) BLAST
resource facilitated the identiﬁcation of the catalytic triad and
oxyanion hole residues. 2 The native protein signal peptide and
1http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc
2http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de/
corresponding cleavage site were predicted using the SignalP
5.0 server (Armenteros et al., 2019). Subcellular localization was
inferred with PSORTb (Yu et al., 2010), Gpos-mPLoc (Shen
and Chou, 2009), and FUEL-mLoc (Wan et al., 2017). The
ExPASy-ProtParam tool was applied to predict physico-chemical
properties such as molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point
(pI), amino acid composition, together with aliphatic and
instability indexes (Gasteiger et al., 2005). InterProScan, 3 Pfam,4
and SUPERFAMILY5 databases were applied for protein family
classiﬁcation and to uncover functional protein domains.
The SWISS-MODEL homology-modeling server was run to
predict a three-dimensional (3D) structure for the BgP protein
(Waterhouse et al., 2018). A cutinase-like lipase, SeL, from
Streptomyces exfoliatus (PDB Accession Code: 1JFR) (Wei et al.,
1998), served as a template for model construction. Model
quality was initially assessed from SWISS-MODEL parameters,
followed by validation using ERRAT (Colovos and Yeates, 1993),
VERIFY3D (Eisenberg et al., 1997), and PROCHECK (Laskowski
et al., 2006), which are tools within the Structure Analysis and
Veriﬁcation Server 6.0 (SAVES 6), in addition to the ProSA-web
server (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007). The active site pocket
and potential binding residues were detected using Phyre2
(Colovos and Yeates, 1993) together with 3DLigandSite (Wass
et al., 2010). Protein stability was predicted by SCooP (v 1.0),
using a temperature-dependent dataset containing mesostable
and thermostable proteins (Pucci et al., 2017). UCSF-Chimera
was used to visualize the 3D model and enable structural
comparison with the known polyesterase Cut190 (PDB code:
4WFI) (Pettersen et al., 2004).
Cloning and Heterologous Expression
Snapgene (v 5.2.5.1) software 7 was employed to assist primer
design and to simulate cloning. The GenScript Restriction
Enzyme Map Analysis Tool 8 and the Molbiotools Restriction
Analyzer9 were used to assess the native gene sequence and
aid in the selection of restriction enzymes. The Sigma-Aldrich
OligoEvaluatorTM10 and the Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Multiple
Primer Analyzer 11 were run to predict possible secondary
structures or primer-dimer pairings and revealed the overall
stability, melting temperature (T m), and GC content. The
New England BioLabs (NEB) T m Calculator12 was used to
evaluate speciﬁc annealing and melting temperatures for use
of these primers with Q5
R⃝ High-Fidelity Polymerase (NEB).
Primer binding and PCR product length were predicted by

The bgp gene was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA with
a forward primer (5 ′-AAAAACATATGCACGCACAGAC
CCGCAGGATC-3′), containing an NdeI restriction site that
replaces the gene sequence start codon, and a reverse primer (5 ′-
AAAAAGCGGCCGCTTAATGGTGGTGGTGATGGTGGAAC
GGGCAGGTGGACCGGAC-3′), which incorporates a
C-terminal His-Tag, a stop codon, and aNotI restriction site. The
predicted BgP signal peptide was maintained in the construct
design. The PCR product was cloned into the pET20b( +)
plasmid (Novagen
R⃝), resulting in the pET20b( +):BgP vector
construct, which was transformed into NEB
R⃝ 5-alpha competent
E. coli (New England Biolabs) for storage. The vector was
subsequently conjugated into E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-
RIPL (Agilent Technologies) for heterologous protein expression.
The insert was conﬁrmed by a diagnostic restriction digest of
Miniprep (Qiagen) puriﬁed plasmid, and by colony PCR,
followed by Sanger sequencing of the ampliﬁed product

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Screening for Polyesterase Activities in
Marine-Derived Bacterial Isolates
A recent report on the plastisphere of deep-sea samples in the
Southwest Atlantic Ocean, involving the long-term colonization
of plastic substrates by deep-sea microbes, has identiﬁed taxa in
the core microbiome that may be related to plastic degradation. It
also highlighted the fact that viable strains can be recovered from
deep-sea conditions, which have the potential to be exploited
for their plastic-degradation capacity (Agostini et al., 2021).
A further indication of the potential of the marine environment
as a source of novel polyesterase genes is reﬂected in a study
of marine metagenomic datasets which reported that genes
encoding PET hydrolases are globally distributed in marine
environments (Danso et al., 2018). The capacity of marine
microorganisms to degrade a range of polyesters is likely to be as
a result of the high levels of exposure to plastics and microplastics
that they have been and continue to be exposed to; with estimates
indicating that over 250 thousand tons of plastic are currently
ﬂoating in the oceans (Eriksen et al., 2014).
Previous reports have also highlighted the ability of marine-
derived bacteria to degrade synthetic plastics, including Bacillus
and Rhodococcus strains, together with a MorEst polyesterase
from an Antarctic psychrotrophic bacterium which was able
to degrade a range of polyesters, as well as a Pseudomonas
aestusnigri isolate with a novel polyester hydrolase activity
against PET ﬁlm (Auta et al., 2018; Bollinger et al., 2020;
Nikolaivits et al., 2020). Screening of marine metagenomic
data revealed an esterase, GEN0105, that was shown to
hydrolyze bis(benzoyloxyethyl)-terephthalate (i.e., 3PET), along
with polylactic acid (PLA), and PCL (Hajighasemi et al., 2018).
Most recently, a bacterial consortium containing three marine
bacterial species, namely Exiguobacterium sp., Halomonas sp.,
and Ochrobactrum sp. has been reported to degrade PET
ﬁlm with recombinant hydrolases and esterase genes from
these strains demonstrating strong PET ﬁlm degradation eﬀects
when heterologously expressed in E. coli (Gao and Sun, 2021).
Thus, bacteria from marine environments represent a good
source of polyesterases, which we should begin to sustainably
exploit in the future.
Marine sponges (phylum Porifera) are generally sessile marine
ﬁlter feeders, with some motile and carnivorous exceptions
(Wilkinson, 1978; Lavrov and Kosevich, 2018; Vacelet, 2020).
They harbor an abundant and diverse range of microbial
symbionts, which can be responsible for up to 35% of the sponge
biomass (Vacelet, 1975). Given that marine sponges, such as the
deep-sea sponge Pheronema sp., ﬁlter large quantities of seawater
(up to 24,000 L of water per day/Kg sponge) to obtain nutrients
(Vacelet, 1975; Taylor et al., 2007), coupled with the fact that with
typical densities of bacteria in seawater of up to 106 cells/mL, then
there is the potential for sponges to ingest a total of 2.4 ×1013
bacterial cells on a daily basis (Hill, 2003). Thus, deep-sea sponges
are likely to be a good source of such marine bacteria, with a
number of bacteria from diﬀerent genera having been isolated
from them (Romanenko et al., 2008; Xin et al., 2011; Borchert
et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2020).
There is clear evidence that deep-sea environments are
exposed to microplastics, as evidenced by a report of the presence
of a microplastic ﬁber very similar to PET in the shrimp
Eurythenes plasticus recovered from depths of between 6010 and
6949 in the Mariana Trench in the Northwest Paciﬁc Ocean
(Weston et al., 2020). Thus, given the high levels of plastics and
microplastics in the oceans, marine sponges are likely to be a good
source of bacteria with potential to degrade polyesters. This is
borne out by the fact that we recently reported on a PETase-like
enzyme with polycaprolactone (PCL)-degrading activity which
was identiﬁed in Streptomyces SM14 strain which was isolated
from the sponge Haliclona simulans (Almeida et al., 2019).
A total of 51 bacterial strains that had previously been
isolated from various marine sources, including shallow sea
lough sponges (Jackson et al., 2012; Margassery et al., 2012),
deep-sea sponges, and seaweeds (unpublished), were screened
for polyesterase activities using tributyrin and PCD substrates,
with either promising or interesting isolates subjected to
further screening on PCL (Molitor et al., 2020). Five deep-
sea sponge isolates had their activities conﬁrmed on the three
substrates, with Brachybacterium ginsengisoli strain B129SM11
and Micrococcus sp. strain B226SK6 showing the best range of
activities (Table 1). The isolate B226SK6 from Inﬂatella pellicula
targeted tributyrin more speciﬁcally, with fainter activity toward
the polyester substrates, whereas the isolate B129SM11 from
Pheronema sp. sponge displayed superior activity across all
three substrates. Based on these activities, the B129SM11 strain
was chosen for genome sequencing and subsequent genome
mining, in an eﬀort to identify genes potentially involved in
PCL degradation.
Tributyrin is a short-chain triglyceride that served as a suitable
substrate for preliminary screening, given that polyesterases
also display lipolytic activity. For more speciﬁc targeting of
polyesterases, the aliphatic polyesters PCD and PCL were
employed. Although these are aliphatic polyesters, with a simple
composition compared to aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters like
PET, many polyesterase enzymes have been reported to have
activity toward both substrate types (Molitor et al., 2020).

The genus Brachybacterium is a high GC member of the
Dermabacteraceae family, within the phylum Actinobacteria.
Brachybacterium species have previously been identiﬁed from
various environments including oil-contaminated coastal sand,
lake sediment, and more recently from deep-sea sediments
in the Southern Ocean (Zhao et al., 2017; Ziganshina et al.,
2018). Brachybacterium species have previously been reported
in association with sponges (Kiran et al., 2014; Liu et al.,
2019b), including deep-sea sponges from the Antarctic (Xin
et al., 2011). While marine Actinobacteria have been reported
to be capable of remediation of environmental pollutants
including petroleum hydrocarbons and plastics (Rathore et al.,
2021); members of the genus Brachybacterium have also been
shown to possess the ability to degrade alkanes, phenols,
and naphthalene (Velmurugan and Arunachalam, 2009; Wang
et al., 2010, 2014). In addition, following the screening of
Actinobacteria from a marine lake, a Brachybacterium sp. isolate
was identiﬁed which displayed high lipolytic activity (Sadati
et al., 2021). Thus, Brachybacterium ginsengisoli B129SM11 from
the deep-sea sponge Pheronema sp. was expected to be an
interesting candidate for further investigation in the context of
polyester degradation.
Genome Analyses and Mining of
Brachybacterium ginsengisoliB129SM11
Genome mining, in combination with computational tools
and dedicated databases, allows for the identiﬁcation of new
homologs of enzymes of biotechnological interest and oﬀers
an eﬃcient means to discover potential novel biocatalysts
(Zaparucha et al., 2018). Recent examples of biocatalysts
that have been uncovered using a genome mining-based
approach include a thermostable monoacylglycerol lipase from
a deep-sea Geobacillus sp. (Tang et al., 2019) and a salt-
tolerant, enantio-selective esterase from the actinobacterium
Dactylosporangium aurantiacum that generated optically pure
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (Wang et al., 2018).
Genomic DNA from B. ginsengisoli B129SM11 was sequenced
using the Illumina HiSeq NGS system. The raw sequence data
was evaluated in terms of overall quality prior to genome
assembly and annotation. A high-quality draft genome was
successfully assembled for strain B129SM11 in 22 contigs, with
100% completeness and very low contamination (0.58%). The
assembled genome (3.98 Mb) displayed a high GC content of
71.55%. A total of 3,505 coding sequences (CDS) were annotated
by Prokka ( Supplementary Table 1 ). The B129SM11 genome
properties are similar to those of other Brachybacterium spp.
genomes deposited in the NCBI database in terms of genome size,
GC content, and number of CDSs.
The genome of strain B129SM11 was mined for genes
encoding potential PET polyesterases by ﬁrst assembling a
reference data set containing 26 PET hydrolyzing enzymes or
homologs having functionally veriﬁed activities against some
PET and/or synthetic polyester substrates (Table 2). This dataset
was used to construct a database with the BLASTP suite tool
to search against, including four thermophilic cutinases which
have been recognized as the most promising candidates for PET
biorecycling to date; HiC and LCC, together with TfCut2 and
Cut190 mutants (Kawai et al., 2020) (Table 3). Cut190 and TfCut2
are actinobacterial enzymes, whereas LCC and HiC are derived
from metagenomic and fungal sources, respectively.
BgP was identiﬁed by employing a BLASTP sequence
similarity search of the Prokka-annotated protein output ﬁle
generated for strain B129M11, against the polyesterase database.
BgP produced signiﬁcant alignments with 24 of the 26 enzymes,
including Cut190, TfCut2, and LCC. BgP was annotated as a
“poly(ethylene) terephthalate hydrolase, ” although it cannot be
assumed based on this preliminary description that BgP is a
true PET hydrolase. The protein shared high amino acid identity
(>55%) with LCC, TfCut2, and Cut190 (Table 3). Of these three
enzymes, BgP shared the highest sequence identity, that is 62%,
with Cut190 from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 (UniProt
Accession: W0TJ64) (Kawai et al., 2014). Given that HiC is a
fungal cutinase, it was not expected to produce as signiﬁcant an
alignment with BgP. The gene sequence for BgP was deposited
in the GenBank database and can be found under the accession
number ON000823.1 (Submission ID: 2562113).
Computational Protein Analyses of BgP
Enzyme
Synthetic polyester plastics may be hydrolyzed by microbial
lipases, carboxylesterases, and cutinases, which can therefore
be collectively referred to as polyesterases (Gricajeva et al.,
2021). Many polyesterases are PET hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs),
although cutinases are considered most eﬀective in cleaving
polyester bond linkages (Kawai et al., 2020). It has been suggested
that PHEs should be categorized either as PET-surface modifying
enzymes or PET hydrolases, based on their diﬀering abilities
to hydrolyze the inner building blocks of PET. The PET
hydrolase group can be further divided into mesophilic and
thermophilic members, with thermophilic PETases deemed more
suitable for application in the biological recycling of PET, given
that this process requires temperatures between 65 and 75 ◦C
where the polymer is ﬂexible enough for enzyme access. On
the other hand, mesophilic enzymes resembling IsPETase from
I. sakaiensis 201-F6, which have been found in both marine and
terrestrial environments, are deemed more appropriate for the
decomposition of PET waste. However, this presents its own
challenges, for instance when environmental temperatures are
not compatible with the enzyme employed (Kawai et al., 2019,
2020; Kawai, 2021). There are four thermophilic PET hydrolases
that have been considered appropriate for PET biorecycling;
metagenomic LCC, and variants of Cut190 and TfCut2 from
actinomycetes (Table 3), along with fungal HiC. More recently,
two thermophilic polyesterases from metagenomic sources,
namely, PHL7 (Sonnendecker et al., 2021) and BhrPETase (Xi
et al., 2021) have emerged as promising candidates, with highly
eﬃcient activities toward amorphous PET ﬁlms.
BgP was classiﬁed as an α/β hydrolase member using
InterProScan, Pfam, and SUPERFAMILY. Most polyesterases
fall into this α/β hydrolase superfamily, which is comprised of
enzymes that are structurally similar, yet functionally diverse
(Gricajeva et al., 2021). Based on the results generated from

Gpos-mPLoc and FUEL-mLoc, the enzyme appears to be
extracellular. SignalP predicted a Sec/SPI-type signal peptide
(ﬁrst 30 AA) for standard secretion, with a likelihood of 0.9571.
A potential cleavage site (AFA-AD) was identiﬁed between
positions 31 and 32, based on the probability value of 0.9741.
In an eﬀort to gain further insights into the potential
functional and evolutionary relatedness of BgP to known
polyesterases, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with protein
sequences of BgP and PET-hydrolyzing enzymes or their
homologs, using MEGA-X with CLUSTALW sequence alignment
(Figure 1 ; Thompson et al., 1994). HiC is phylogenetically
distinct due to its fungal origin and was therefore excluded
from our phylogenetic reconstruction. All enzymes in the
tree appear to originate from a common ancestor, with the
exception of BsEstB, a PET hydrolyzing p-nitrobenzylesterase
that is structurally diﬀerent from most α/β hydrolases with a
sequence length > 400 bp and where glutamate replaces the more
commonly observed aspartate of the polyesterase catalytic triad.
Proteins derived from thermophilic Actinobacteria are seen to
form one clade, descending from the same node, while proteins
from Proteobacteria comprise another clade, with these two
clades labeled 1 and 2, respectively ( Figure 1). Our polyesterase,
BgP , appears to be located closer to clade 1, although derived
from a diﬀerent node, where it groups with SM14est from the
Haliclona simulans sponge. Given that BgP and SM14est are
also actinobacterial enzymes, their separation from clade 1 may
be due to the mesophilic nature of the strains from which
they were isolated.
Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated
using T-COFFEE Expresso, which also incorporates structural
information (Armougom et al., 2006). Most cutinases (e.g.,
Cut190 and TfCut2) are designated as type I PETases, possessing
one C-terminal disulﬁde bond, whereas type II PETases (e.g.,
IsPETase and PE-H) have an additional disulﬁde bond (Joo et al.,
2018; Bollinger et al., 2020). Upon alignment with either the
type I or type II PETases and visualization in ESPript, BgP was
found to resemble the type I enzymes, with a single disulﬁde
bond found near its terminal end (Supplementary Figures 2, 3).
Given that BgP appears closely related to SM14est, based on their
phylogeny, an alignment was also produced for these enzymes
FIGURE 1 | Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of BgP among known PET-hydrolyzing enzymes and homologs from the reference dataset. Bootstrap
consensus was inferred with 100 replicates, displaying only values above 50%, and the best-ﬁt substitution model for this tree was WAG + G. Two main taxonomic
clades are indicated; (1) proteins from thermophilic Actinobacteria (shaded in yellow) and (2) proteins from psychrophilic or mesophilic Proteobacteria (shaded in
orange). BgP (starred) is tightly clustered with marine sponge-derived SM14est. LCC and BhrPETase from metagenomic thermophiles are also clustered together.
A Geobacillus stearothermophilus acetylxylan esterase, Axe2 (UniProt Accession Number: Q09LX1) served as an outgroup.

FIGURE 2 | Amino acid sequence structural alignment of BgP and Cut190 generated with T-COFFEE Expresso and rendered using ESPript 3.0. Cut190 was
indicated as a suitable structural homolog for BgP by the Phyre2 server. Amino acid residues shaded in red represent the ones strictly conserved between BgP and
Cut190, while residues highlighted in yellow depict areas with an average level of homology. Catalytic triad residues are marked with a blue star, and disulﬁde bond
cysteines are marked with a yellow triangle. The pentapeptide Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly serine hydrolase motif is outlined with a blue box.
(Supplementary Figure 4 ). This indicated that 53% of their
amino acids are identical, and a further 29% of their residues are
biochemically similar.
Cut190 was selected for amino acid sequence comparison
with BgP ( Figure 2), based on the BLASTP sequence identities
and Phyre2 predictions, where it was ranked as one of the top
structural templates. From the resulting MSA, it was inferred that
54% of the amino acids in BgP were identical to Cut190, and that
83% of the BgP residues share similar biochemical properties to
those of Cut190. The pentapeptide motif GHSMG is conserved
in both sequences, together with the serine hydrolase catalytic
triad (Ser-Asp-His). Both enzymes possess C-terminal cysteine
residues, which can potentially join covalently to form a disulﬁde
bond. The MSA had perfect agreement across all alignment
methods used, with the output having an average consistency
score of 100 (from 0 to 100).
Cut190 is a cutinase-like enzyme from Saccharomonospora
viridis AHK190 that has been reported to hydrolyze PET (Kawai
et al., 2014; Miyakawa et al., 2015). It is also a member of the
lipase family and its thermostability and activity are enhanced
by high concentrations of calcium ions, which are essential for
the eﬃcient enzymatic hydrolysis of amorphous PET (Miyakawa
et al., 2015). Early mutagenesis studies of Cut190 found that
an S226P/R228S substitution led to the highest activity and
thermostability (Kawai et al., 2014). The resulting variant, named
Cut190∗, has been the target of multiple X-ray crystallography
experiments and additional mutational analyses to elucidate
the Ca 2+-binding mechanism and further improve the variant
for PET hydrolysis applications (Kawai et al., 2014; Miyakawa
et al., 2015; Kawabata et al., 2017; Oda et al., 2018). Cut190 ∗SS,
a variant generated by combined mutation (Q138A/D250C-
E296C/Q13H/N202H), increased the thermostability of Cut190 ∗
from 63 to 70 ◦C, with a three-fold increase in PET ﬁlm
degradation. This suggests that there may be scope to undertake
similar mutational modiﬁcation of the BgP enzyme to generate
variants with improved biochemical characteristics.
Protein Homology Modeling for BgP and
Comparative Analysis With Cut190
Homology models that represent protein three-dimensional
structure often oﬀer insights into their conformation and
functionality and enable the visualization of important features
(Waterhouse et al., 2018). BgP was modeled using the SWISS-
MODEL server, based on the top template, an enzyme named

SeL, from Streptomyces exfoliatus (PDB code: 1JFR) ( Figure 3).
The signal peptide sequence of BgP was excluded in agreement
with the SeL template, leaving 259 residues (32–290). The BgP
model displayed a GMQE score of 0.87 (measured between 0 and
1, with higher numbers representing models with higher expected
quality) and a QMEAN Z-score of−0.44 (with scores below −4.0
indicating low quality), indicating that the predicted model was
reliable. Quality was also evaluated with tools from the SAVES
suite, through which the BgP model was further validated. The
ERRAT Overall Quality Factor was calculated to be 94.7% and
a VERIFY averaged 3D-1D score ( ≥0.2) of 100%, exceeding the
threshold values in both cases. The overall PROCHECK G-score
was predicted to be −0.12 (negative value desired) and the ProSA
Z-score was −8.15 (within native conformation range), with both
indicating good model quality. PROCHECK Ramachandran plot
calculations revealed 92.6% of amino acid residues in the most
favored regions, with an additional 7% in allowed regions, and
0% in disallowed regions.
Structural analysis of the BgP model was completed in UCSF-
Chimera allowing the key features to be located. The BgP enzyme
possesses six full α-helices which surround a central β-sheet
consisting of nine strands. This ﬂexible core is a signature
fold within the α/β hydrolase superfamily and is considered
responsible for the multifunctionality of its member enzymes
(Rauwerdink and Kazlauskas, 2015; Gricajeva et al., 2021).
Active site residues Ser130, Asp176, and His208 are found
in close proximity to each other, forming the catalytic triad
that is typical of serine hydrolases. The active site lies at the
apex of the β-sheet, which is consistent with polyesterases. All
previously reported polyesterases display a Ser-Asp/Glu-His triad
and follow the same catalytic mechanism where a nucleophilic
serine initiates ester bond hydrolysis (Gricajeva et al., 2021). The
Cys241 faces Cys257 at the C-terminal, bringing the residues
into contact for disulﬁde linkage. The distance between these
cysteine residues was measured to be 2.046Å, which corresponds
to the typical length of a disulﬁde bond (Chaney and Steinrauf,
1974). Unlike cutinases and PETases, the lipase and esterase
enzymes involved in polyester hydrolysis do not possess a
disulﬁde bond. Both lipases and esterases have a lid-domain
formed by at least two α-helices. Although the lid facilitates
adsorption onto hydrophobic polyesters, it also covers the active
site in these enzymes, which is buried relatively deeply within
these enzymes. This lid structure is absent in most cutinases,
which together with a more exposed active site near the enzyme
surface, increases access to polyester substrates (Kawai et al.,
2019). The Streptomyces exfoliatus template (1JFR) is an example
of a cutinase-like lipase that lacks a lid domain (Khan et al.,
2017), and this alpha-helical structure also appears to be absent
from the BgP enzyme.
The Chimera MatchMaker tool was used for structural
comparison of BgP with Cut190 ( Figure 4 ). The Ser-Asp-His
catalytic triad is conserved between the two enzymes, positioned
as Ser176, Asp222, and His254 in Cut190, and as Ser130, Asp176,
and His208 in BgP. Disulﬁde bond residues were positioned
as follows; Cys241 and Cys257 in Cut190, and Cys287 and
Cys302 in BgP. The polyesterase active site is found within
a pocket called the substrate binding groove (SBG) (Gricajeva
et al., 2021). There is also a conserved methionine adjacent to
each nucleophilic serine, at position 177 in Cut190 and at 131
in BgP ( Table 4 ). Met177 has been reported as an oxyanion
hole-forming amino acid in Cut190 (Kawabata et al., 2017),
while results from the LED database also point to Met131

as an oxyanion residue for BgP. The oxyanion hole stabilizes
the reaction intermediate during polyester hydrolysis and is
regarded as an important structural determinant of catalytic
eﬃciency (Gricajeva et al., 2021). In Cut190, the oxyanion hole
is formed by Met177 together with another residue, Phe106
(Kawabata et al., 2017). There is no corresponding phenylalanine
residue implicated at this position in BgP , but instead another
hydrophobic residue, Tyr62, is present in its place ( Table 4).
Tyrosine participates in oxyanion hole formation in certain α/β
hydrolases and replaces phenylalanine in other PHEs such as
TfCut2 and IsPETase, where it is believed to play a similar
role in intermediate stabilization (Bauer et al., 2020; Tan et al.,
2021). The importance of Phe106 for the activity of Cut190 is
reﬂected in the fact that during mutational analysis of Cut190, the
replacement of Phe106 with tyrosine led to decreased turnover
of the model substrate poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate), or
PBSA (Kawabata et al., 2017). Mutational and kinetic analyses
will be required to investigate the potential role of Tyr62 in
BgP during polyester hydrolysis, particularly if this residue has
a similar impact on substrate turnover, as observed for Cut190.
3DLigandSite, which employs structural results from the
Phyre2 protein recognition server, was used to gain further
insights into potential ligand-binding residues in BgP. Excluding
the catalytic triad residues, 12 of the 16 binding residues predicted
by 3DLigandSite were found to be conserved in Cut190, including
hydrophobic Pro60, Gly61, Ala64, Met131, Gly132, Trp155,
and Ala179. In polyesterases, hydrophobic amino acid residues
found in the substrate-binding groove form crucial interactions
with the substrate. Trp155 lies directly opposite the oxyanion
residue Tyr62. The corresponding residue in Cut190, Trp201,

aBased on mutational analysis of Cut190 (Kawabata et al., 2017).
was previously highlighted as having a role in substrate-binding,
with low activity observed upon mutation of this residue; with
the suggestion that binding is inﬂuenced by the indole ring in
tryptophan and that the loss in activity following mutation was
caused by weakened enzyme-substrate interactions (Kawabata
et al., 2017). Along with Trp201, active site Ser176, and oxyanion
Met177, results from the same study also indicated Gly105,
Gln138, and Ile224 as likely Cut190 interacting residues using a
partial PBSA structure called BABSBA. Gly105 and Gln138 are
matched in BgP at positions 61 and 94, respectively. The Ile224
is replaced with a Val178 at the corresponding location in BgP.
Although valine is smaller than isoleucine, both are hydrophobic
amino acids, and share similar biochemical properties. In Cut190,
mutation of Ile224 to Ala224, which is the smallest hydrophobic
residue, was shown to increase activity despite a decrease in
substrate aﬃnity (Kawabata et al., 2017).
Cut190 has been shown to undergo a conformational change
upon addition of Ca2+ions, which bind to the enzyme and result
in its activation (Oda et al., 2018). Three Ca2+-binding sites have
been revealed by X-ray crystallography, involving the following
amino acids; Ser76, Ala78, and Phe81 (site 1), Glu220, Asp250,
and Glu296 (site 2), and Asp204 and Thr206 (site 3) (Oda et al.,
2018). The serine and phenylalanine of site 1 are conserved in BgP
(positions 31 and 37), together with the aspartate and threonine
of site 3 (positions 158 and 160). Mutational analysis of Cut190
indicated that sites 1 and 3 are involved in activation, while sites
2 and 3 inﬂuence structural and thermal stability (Oda et al.,
2018). It has also been reported that certain Cut190 residues
only interact with the model substrate when the enzyme is in the
Ca2+-bound state, namely Ser112, His175, Phe255, and Asn258
(Kawabata et al., 2017). In BgP , Ser68, His129, and Asn258
are conserved at the equivalent locations, with the exception
of Phe255 which is replaced by Leu at BgP position 209. The
presence of Ca 2+ ions is an essential prerequisite for Cut190
in the context of PET polymer degradation, with this enzyme
displaying active (Ca 2+-bound) and inactive (Ca 2+-free) states
during PET hydrolysis (Kawai et al., 2014; Senga et al., 2021). The
importance of metal ions (e.g., Ca 2+and Mg 2+) for increased
stability and degradation of PET has also been highlighted for
other polyesterases, including TfCut2, and LCC (Sulaiman et al.,
2014; Then et al., 2015). Given the similarities between BgP and
Cut190, we expect it would be worth investigating the inﬂuence
of metal ions on BgP functionality, with the potential to further
increase activity by engineering of the ion-binding sites.
The glass transition temperature ( Tg) of PET is an important
consideration for enzymatic hydrolysis, since its polymer chains
display increased ﬂexibility when reaction temperatures are set
near or above Tg (Carr et al., 2020). For hydrolysis of amorphous
PET under aqueous conditions, enzyme thermostability at 55 ◦C,
or preferably above 60 ◦C, is recommended to facilitate eﬃcient
degradation, as exempliﬁed by Cut190 ∗ (Kawai et al., 2014).
During in silico protein analysis, BgP was classiﬁed as a stable
protein based on the calculated instability index (32.44). The
potential thermostability of BgP is indicated by its high aliphatic
index (77.76), and its theoretical melting temperature ( Tm) of
69.4◦C. However, further biochemical characterization of BgP
will be required to determine its temperature proﬁle and evaluate

its stability under various reaction conditions. In an eﬀort to
determine potential targets for the engineering of improved BgP
variants, the activity enhancing mutations in the aforementioned
Cut190∗and Cut190∗SS may be valid targets. Based on conserved
residues at these positions, the following mutations may be
appropriate; S226P , R228S, Q138A, and N202H. However, a
random mutagenesis approach may be more rewarding, given
that there is no guarantee that mutations at these positions would
generate similar results in BgP and considering that there might
be other targets in the enzyme that prove more worthwhile.
Cloning and Heterologous Expression of
BgP
To determine whether the bgp gene does encode polyesterase
activity, it was ampliﬁed from B129SM11 genomic DNA
using primers that were designed to incorporate the native
Brachybacterium ginsengisoli signal peptide, and a C-terminal
His6 tag. The gene was then cloned into the expression
vector pET20b( +), generating the pET20b( +):BgP construct
(Supplementary Figure 1). Following transformation into E. coli
NEB
R⃝ 5-alpha, the construct was conjugated into the BL21
(DE3)-RIPL expression host. Polyesterase activity was conﬁrmed
using tributyrin, PCD, and PCL plate clearing assays ( Figure 5),
with zones observed on all three types of agar, indicating the
hydrolysis of each substrate. The negative control, i.e., E. coli
BL21 (DE3)-RIPL containing the pET-20b( +) plasmid without
the insert did not display such activity toward any of the three
substrates (Supplementary Figure 5).
In our previous study, SM14est was successfully exported
by the E. coli heterologous host when its native Streptomyces
sp. signal peptide was maintained in the expression construct
(Almeida et al., 2019). We encountered some diﬃculties with
BgP expression, although it is not certain whether this relates
to the use of the native signal sequence in the expression
construct. While zones of clearing were observed, they developed
slowly. In this case, clearing may not indicate extracellular
secretion, but rather leaky expression from the T7 promoter or
perhaps enzyme release following natural cell lysis. The addition
of IPTG was not shown to improve expression, or at least
improvements were not detectable on the plate assays used,
despite various attempts to optimize both induction time and
IPTG concentration ( Supplementary Figure 5 ), and this will
therefore require further investigation. The eﬃcient expression
and secretion of polyesterases from the heterologous host will
not only be important in assisting with protein puriﬁcation
and biochemical characterization of BgP , but it may also
facilitate the use of polyesterase producers in bioremediation-
type applications. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report
of a cutinase-like polyesterase enzyme being identiﬁed in a
deep-sea sponge-derived Brachybacterium isolate, which we hope
will further expand our current knowledge of enzymes for the
degradation of synthetic polyesters.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Polyester-degrading enzymes, which have to date been reported
as either lipase, carboxylesterase, or cutinase family members,
have become the subject of extensive research to achieve
enzymatic hydrolysis of synthetic polyester plastics such as PET.
Given the relatively recent development of synthetic plastic
products and the exponential increase in plastic production and
pollution that followed, the study of PET hydrolase enzymes
has quickly gained traction. A number of PET-hydrolyzing
polyesterases have to date been identiﬁed and characterized,
which together with eﬀorts to elucidate the mechanisms behind
functionality and the engineering of improved variants, has
advanced the ﬁeld to the extent that the practical implementation
of biological PET degradation systems is now being examined.
However, there are many factors preventing the complete
hydrolysis of PET by polyesterases, particularly due to the
individual properties of diﬀerent PET products and in particular
due to the fact that most of our knowledge to date is limited to
the enzyme’s interactions with amorphous PET ﬁlms and with
model substrates. Furthermore, much of the research in this area
is focused on PET biorecycling applications, with less known
about polyesterases in the context of environmental degradation
and potential for enzymatic remediation.
While most PET polyesterases that have been reported to date
have primarily been from Actinobacteria, we report here on a
novel polyesterase from a member of the genus Brachybacterium
which was isolated from the deep-sea sponge Pheronema

sp. at a depth of 2,129 m. Activity testing and subsequent
genome mining of B. ginsengisoli B129SM11 resulted in the
identiﬁcation of BgP , a cutinase-like polyesterase that successfully
hydrolyzed tributyrin, polycaprolactone, and polycaprolactone
diol substrates following heterologous expression in E. coli .
Important functional and mechanistic insights were gained
through comparisons with known PET hydrolases and by protein
modeling of BgP. This work lays the foundation for future
biochemical characterization and kinetic analysis, as well as
mutational studies to determine structure-function relationships
to potentially improve the enzyme for polyester hydrolysis
and other biocatalytic applications. Furthermore, it would be
interesting to explore the possible role of BgP in B. ginsengisoli
in the context of its native deep-sea ecosystem, and speciﬁcally
its function within the sponge microbiome. That said, we should
consider that hydrolases are highly promiscuous, and enzymes
such as BgP may not have speciﬁcally evolved to degrade
PET, and its involvement in PET degradation would require
additional enzymes and transporters as part of a speciﬁc PET
catabolic pathway. Nonetheless, further exploration of the role
of BgP will broaden our understanding of polyesterases in
marine environments and potentially facilitate the development
of bioremediation-based applications in these ecosystems.
