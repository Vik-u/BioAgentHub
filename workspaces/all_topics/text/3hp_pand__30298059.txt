The beta-hydroxy acid 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an attractive platform
compound that can be used as a precursor for many commercially interesting
compounds. In order to reduce the dependence on petroleum and follow sustainable
development, 3-HP has been produced biologically from glucose or glycerol. It is
reported that 3-HP synthesis pathways can be constructed in microbes such as
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
Among these host strains, yeast is prominent because of its strong acid tolerance
which can simplify the fermentation process. Currently, the malonyl-CoA reductase
pathway and the β-alanine pathway have been successfully constructed in yeast.
This review presents the current developments in 3-HP production using yeast as an
industrial host. By combining genome-scale engineering tools, malonyl-CoA biosensors
and optimization of downstream fermentation, the production of 3-HP in yeast has the
potential to reach or even exceed the yield of chemical production in the future.

INTRODUCTION
With the reduction of easily obtainable fossil fuels and sustainable development becoming the
mainstream of the world, petroleum-based compounds are gradually being replaced by bio-based
compounds to meet the increasing demands for bulk materials and ﬁne chemicals alike (Nielsen
and Keasling, 2016; Chen et al., 2018a). Increasingly sophisticated cell factories are being built
to produce many renewable bio-based chemicals. Among them, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-
HP) ranked third in the top 12 value-added chemicals from biomass listed by the United States
Department of Energy in 2004 (Werpy et al., 2004). As a hydroxy-functionalized carboxylic
acid, 3-HP is a promising platform chemical, which can be transformed to a variety of worthy
products such as malonic acid, acrylic acid, acrylic esters, 1,3-propanediol, and building blocks
for biodegradable polymers (Liu et al., 2017). The two most important present applications of
3-HP are the production of acrylic acid and poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid) (P[3-HP]). Acrylic
acid is able to be obtained by dehydrating 3-HP , and acrylic acid-derived products are widely
used in paints, paper, baby diapers, adhesives, textiles, specialty coatings, and superabsor. While
P[3-HP] has good mechanical properties and can be hydrolyzed enzymatically, mainly used
for making surgical products (Zhang et al., 2004; Pina et al., 2011). It has been pointed out

that 3-HP has a wide market and great application value. It can
be obtained by chemical synthesis and biosynthesis methods.
Traditional chemical synthesis of 3-HP is well-established, but
resource limitations, high price and the toxicity of the used
raw materials do not meet the new sustainable development
goals. Compared with chemical synthesis, biosynthesis methods
have many advantages, including cheaper substrates, mild
reaction conditions and simple operation, which are compatible
with sustainable development, and the reduced amounts of
byproducts help reduce the cost of production.
In recent years, the biosynthesis of 3-HP has attracted
wide attention, which led to rapid new developments. First
discovered as an intermediate metabolite of the 3-HP cycle in
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus , 3-HP was also found in Acidianus
brierleyi, Acidianus ambivalens, and Sulfolobus metallicus (Holo,
1989; Strauss et al., 1992; Jiang et al., 2009).
Up till now, three known pathways for 3-HP production
have been constructed in recombinant organisms, the glycerol
pathway, the β-alanine pathway, and the malonyl-CoA reductase
(MCR) pathway. The natural generation of 3-HP proceeds
through the glycerol pathway (Lan et al., 2015). However, the
intermediate metabolite 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) is
toxic to cells and requires an eﬃcient aldehyde dehydrogenase
to convert it to 3-HP. To prevent the accumulation of this toxic
intermediate, current emphasis is on balancing the enzymes’
expression (Jiang et al., 2009). The MCR pathway, which used
the intermediate malonyl-CoA as the substrate, only involves
one enzymatic reaction, mainly depending on MCR (Chen et al.,
2014; Lian et al., 2018). However, the β-alanine pathway is
considered to be the most economically attractive (Borodina
et al., 2015).
Three common hosts for the biosynthesis of 3-HP
from glucose and/or glycerol are Escherichia coli , Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Although
E. coli is the most widely studied, there are many limitations
slowing further research. In E. coli , the conversion of glycerol
to 3-HP requires to add additional coenzyme B 12 to the culture
medium, which is sensitive to oxygen and replaced by vitamin
B12 because of the aerobic conditions required for 3-HP
production (Roth et al., 1996; Daniel et al., 1998; Toraya, 2002;
Rathnasingh et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014;
Ko et al., 2014). Since E. coli cannot produce coenzyme B 12,
it requires exogenous addition, which increases the cost of
industrial production signiﬁcantly (Valdehuesa et al., 2013).
K. pneumoniae is another alternative host, and it can synthesize
coenzyme B 12 naturally (Kumar et al., 2013). However, in
addition to being a pathogenic bacterium, it is also a challenge
for K. pneumoniae to balance electron transportation from
NADH to NAD + with the oxygen demand and the decrease
of coenzyme B 12 production under aerobic conditions (Kumar
et al., 2013; Chen and Nielsen, 2016). Moreover, the pH decrease
due to the production of 3-HP in E. coli and K. pneumoniae
leads to an acidic intracellular pH, which seriously aﬀects cell
growth, resulting in reduced 3-HP tolerance. The toxicity of
3-HP requires the addition of a large amount of base titrant into
the cultures when using these bacteria. By contrast, yeast has a
strong intrinsic tolerance to low pH, and recombinant strains
based on yeast are not aﬀected by 3-HP toxicity, signiﬁcantly
reducing the fermentation cost (Liu et al., 2017). Kildegaard
et al. (2014) proposed that 3-HP could be converted to toxic
3-HPA by aldehyde dehydrogenases and subsequently detoxiﬁed
through glutathione-dependent reactions in yeast. Due to its
advantages of high tolerance to relatively low pH, available
whole-genome sequences of multiple strains, and easy molecular
genetic manipulation, yeast is perhaps the most promising host
strain for 3-HP production (Liu et al., 2017).
ENGINEERING YEAST FOR EFFICIENT
3-HP PRODUCTION
As shown in Figure 1 , two eﬃcient pathways for 3-HP
production from glucose have been constructed in yeast –
the MCR pathway and the β-alanine pathway, and the main
metabolic engineering strategies are summarized in Table 1.
The Malonyl-CoA Reductase Pathway
Recently, the MCR pathway has been successfully constructed
in yeast. This pathway relies on the conversion of glucose
into pyruvate by glycolysis. The pyruvate is used to generate
acetaldehyde by PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), then
acetate is formed by oxidation of ADH (aldehyde dehydrogenase)
and further converted to acetyl-CoA by ACS (acetyl-CoA
synthetase) (Tang et al., 2015). As the most important precursor
of 3-HP production, malonyl-CoA is generated from acetyl-CoA
by ACC1 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), and the ﬁnal product 3-HP
is produced via a two-step reaction catalyzed by MCR. MCR is
a bi-functional enzyme, consisting of two short-chain domains,
the N-terminal domain encoding an alcohol dehydrogenase
and the C-terminal encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase. The
production of 3-HP was successfully increased by balancing
these two enzyme domains (Hügler et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2013,
2016). The production of malonyl-CoA is strictly regulated in
yeast, and its yield in the cytoplasm directly aﬀects the 3-HP
production. Therefore, it is meaningful to increase the malonyl-
CoA concentration in the cytoplasm.
Improving the Supply of the Precursor Acetyl-CoA
Malonyl-CoA is an important substrate for the production of
3-HP by MCR. It is mainly produced from acetyl-CoA by
ACC1, and known as a ﬂux-controlling step (Tehlivets et al.,
2007; Chen et al., 2018b). Therefore, the accumulation of
acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm has a signiﬁcant impact on the
synthesis of 3-HP. In S. cerevisiae , pyruvate in the cytoplasm
can be converted to acetaldehyde through decarboxylation,
thus further generate acetyl-CoA. And the acetaldehyde can
further converted to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase, resulting
in the so-called Crabtree eﬀect (Hoek et al., 1998; Chen
et al., 2013). Studies of acetyl-CoA metabolism have shown
that it is quite complex in yeast, where it can be produced
in the mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the cytosol (Pronk
et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2012). In S. cerevisiae , acetyl-CoA
cannot be transported to diﬀerent compartments spontaneously,
and instead utilizes a carnitine/acetyl-carnitine shuttle or the

glyoxylate cycle (Chen et al., 2013). Therefore, many studies
have focused on increasing the amount of acetyl-CoA in the
cytoplasm.
Three strategies have been proposed to increase the
accumulation of acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. The ﬁrst strategy
relies on pulling carbon into the cytosolic pool (Kocharin
et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013). Ethanol is the main metabolite
of S. cerevisiae , but a by-product in the production of 3-
HP. When the endogenous ADH2 (alcohol dehydrogenase)
was co-expressed with ALD6 (NADP-dependent aldehyde
dehydrogenase), ACC1 and a codon optimized ACS variant,
ACSse (an acetylation-insensitive acetyl-CoA synthetase from
Salmonella enterica ), the ﬂux was successfully redirected from
ethanol to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol, which improved 3-HP
production to 210 mg/L, up to twofold of the control strain
(Chen et al., 2014). It is reported that intracellular acetyl-CoA
levels could be increased to 2.19 fold by overexpression of ACS1
(acetyl-CoA synthetase 1) in S. cerevisiae, and improved to 5.02
fold by overexpression of ACS2 (acetyl-CoA synthetase 2) (Chen
et al., 2013). ACC1 activity is repressed by Snf1 protein kinase at
the protein level, as phosphorylation by Snf1 inactivates ACC1
(Woods et al., 1994). Shi et al. (2014) improved the activity

of ACC1 in S. cerevisiae by abolishing the Snf1-dependent
regulation through mutating the target sites of Snf1-mediated
phosphorylation (Ser659 →Ala, and Ser1157 →Ala). Further
overexpression of the mutated ACC1 (ACC1 ∗∗) increased the
3-HP titer to ∼279 mg/L, increased more than 2.2-fold in
comparison with the wild-type.
The second strategy relies on reducing the consumption of
acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm by other accessory metabolic
pathways. Acetyl-CoA is produced in four diﬀerent
compartments of the S. cerevisiae cells by diﬀerent metabolic
mechanisms. Pyruvate from the cytoplasm generates acetyl-
CoA by PDH and then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
via CIT (citrate synthase). In the peroxisomes, acetyl-CoA is
generated from acetate by ACS and then enters the glyoxylate
cycle via CIT. Part of the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA also enters
the glyoxylate cycle via MLS (malate synthase) (Nielsen, 2014).
To minimize the loss of acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm, CIT2 and
MLS1, which encode the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle,
were individually knocked out (Chen et al., 2012, 2013). Based
on the over-expression of ACC1, ACSse, ADH2 and ALD6, the
3-HP titer could reach 249 mg/L when combined with deletion
of CIT2, and reach 270 mg/L when combined with deletion of
MLS1 (Chen et al., 2014).
The last strategy entails constructing new acetyl-CoA
pathways in the cytoplasm. The pyruvate in the cytoplasm is
partially converted into acetate by PDC (pyruvate decarboxylase),
partly enters the mitochondria to produce acetyl-CoA via the
PDH. Although the PDH is only present in the mitochondria,
if there is no MTS (mitochondrial targeting sequence) in the
structural genes, PDH in the mitochondria will be redirected
to the cytoplasm (cytoPDH), thus constructing a new pathway
to generate acetyl-CoA directly from pyruvate. In one study,
an MTS-free PDH structural genes from S. cerevisiae was used
in combination with the PDH from Enterococcus faecalis to

Ji et al. Engineering Yeast for 3-HP Production
successfully increase the content of acetyl-CoA for the production
of n-butanol (Lian et al., 2014).
Improving the Supply of the Cofactor NADPH
NADPH is another important precursor, functioned as the
cofactor, for 3-HP production through the MCR pathway. In this
pathway, 2 mol NADPH was needed to convert malonyl-CoA
to 3-HP by MCR (Hügler et al., 2002; Valdehuesa et al., 2013;
Lynch et al., 2016). It has been shown that the availability of
NADPH for the production of 3-HP can be increased eﬀectively
by heterologous expression of a non-phosphorylating NADP-
dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN)
(Bro et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2011). Moreover, although the
expression of GAPN can improve the content of NADPH, it has
no eﬀect on the production and biomass yield (Verho et al., 2003;
Chen et al., 2014). When the expression of GAPN was coupled
with improved precursor supply, the 3-HP titer was promoted to
463 mg/L (Chen et al., 2014).
Precisely Control the Supply of Malonyl-CoA
Malonyl-CoA is the direct precursor of 3-HP in the MCR
pathway. It is strictly regulated in yeast and its concentration
is maintained at a low level. Therefore, increasing the cytosolic
malonyl-CoA content is extremely important for improving the
production of the malonyl-CoA derived 3-HP.
To better manipulate malonyl-CoA levels, monitoring and
enhancing the content of malonyl-CoA in real time is vital. In
one approach, a malonyl-CoA sensor was developed based on the
FapR transcription factor from Bacillus subtilis by Li et al. (2015).
They designed the sensor using a codon-optimized bacterial
transcription factor FapR and its corresponding operator fapO
to sense intracellular malonyl-CoA levels in S. cerevisiae for
the ﬁrst time (Li et al., 2015). They combined the biosensor
with a genome-scale cDNA overexpression library, identifying
two key genes that aﬀect the levels of malonyl-CoA, TPI1 and
PMP1. Overexpression of the key genes increased the malonyl-
CoA concentration, further enhancing the 3-HP production by
120%. This sensor provides a novel way to study the complex
malonyl-CoA metabolism and to enhance the 3-HP production.
Utilizing the malonyl-CoA sensor, David et al. (2016) established
a hierarchical dynamic pathway control system on the genetic
level for 3-HP production in S. cerevisiae . They integrated two
diﬀerent levels of dynamic control. The upper level of control was
used to dynamically downregulate fatty acid biosynthesis using
the HXT1 promoter to modifying the FAS1 (fatty acid synthase 1)
gene expression characteristics. The lower level was based on the
malonyl-CoA biosensor, which was used to link the expression
levels of MCR to the intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration.
This novel approach signiﬁcantly improved the production of
3-HP 10-fold in yeast. Chen et al. (2017) successfully improved
the availability of malonyl-CoA through down-regulating the
lipid synthesis. They manipulated the transcriptional regulators
for phospholipid synthesis, including Ino2p, Ino4p, Opi1p, and
a series of synthetic Ino2p variants, to control the malonyl-
CoA levels and increase the synthesis of malonyl-CoA-derived
products. The engineered strain in which multiple regulators
were manipulated showed a 9-fold increase of the 3-HP titer. The
study thus provides a novel strategy to regulate the intracellular
malonyl-CoA availability and the 3-HP production. Maury
et al. (2018) identiﬁed and characterized the yeast promoters
that depend on glucose concentration, i.e., they are strongly
responded to glucose presence or absence, and tried to use them
as dynamic control elements for malonyl-CoA derived 3-HP
production.
The β-Alanine Pathway
Another 3-HP synthesis pathway constructed in yeast is the
β-alanine pathway ( Figure 1 ). Researchers from Cargill Inc.
evaluated three synthetic pathways for 3-HP production which
utilize β-alanine as an intermediate metabolite (Liao et al., 2007;
Gokarn et al., 2011). Two of these are completely unfeasible in
thermodynamic terms, while the third pathway is relatively short
and appeared feasible. However, due to the relatively complex
synthesis of β-alanine by the organism itself, the eﬃciency of
3-HP synthesis remained very low. Nevertheless, many studies
have optimized this pathway and improved the production of
3-HP in yeast (Burk and Osterhout, 2010). This way, glucose is
converted into pyruvate through glycolysis, which in turn is used
to generate β-alanine in three steps. Theβ-alanine is derived from
aspartate by the action of PAND (aspartate decarboxylase), which
is encoded by the pabD gene in bacteria but does not exist in
yeast.
Jessen et al. (2015) proposed that the transformation
of β-alanine to malonic semialdehyde relies on GABT
(γ-aminobutyrate transaminase) and BAPAT ( β-alanine-
pyruvate aminotransferase). Subsequently, malonic
semialdehyde is further dehydrogenated by HPDH (3-
hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase or 3-hydroxyisobutyrate
dehydrogenase) to yield 3-HP (Borodina et al., 2015). In the
whole pathway, the NADPH produced by glycolysis is later
consumed by HPDH, and just 1 mol ATP is generated (Kumar
et al., 2013). Therefore, to improve the 3-HP production through
the β-alanine pathway must resort to the heterologous enzymes.
The BAPAT activity has a large inﬂuence on the production
of 3-HP. BcBAPAT ( β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase
from Bacillus cereus ) is considered to be the most active
enzyme, comparing favorably with the BAPAT homologs from
Pseudomonas putida and P. aeruginosa (Liao et al., 2007, 2010).
EcHPDH (3-hydroxypropanoate dehydrogenase from E. coli )
is another eﬃcient enzyme for the conversion of β-alanine into
3-HP. Aspartate-1-decarboxylases from diﬀerent sources were
also tested to enable β-alanine biosynthesis from aspartate,
among which TcPAND (aspartate-1-decarboxylase from
Tribolium castaneum ) is the most eﬃcient (Lian et al., 2018).
Overexpression of endogenous PYC (pyruvate carboxylase)
and AAT2 (cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase) can be
used to eﬀectively channel the ﬂux from pyruvate to aspartate.
Overexpression of 5 genes, PYC1, PYC2, BcBAPAT, TcPAND,
and PpHIBADH (NADH-dependent 3-hydroxyisobutyrate
dehydrogenase from P. putida) yielded ∼0.6 g/L and ∼0.49 g/L
3-HP from glucose and xylose, respectively (Kildegaard et al.,
2015). A 3-HP high-producing strain can be obtained by
overexpressing ﬁve genes, AAT2, BcBAPAT, EcHPDH, and
PYC1/2, together with multiple copies of TcPAND, producing

12.2 g/L and 13.7g/L of 3-HP by deep fermentation and
controlled fed-batch fermentation at pH 5.0 with glucose as the
substrate, respectively (Borodina et al., 2015).
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
The biosynthesis of 3-HP has developed rapidly in recent
years, and two synthetic pathways of 3-HP , the MCR and
β-alanine pathways, have been established in yeast by rational
metabolic engineering. Using the MCR pathway, the yield of
3-HP could be increased up to ∼10 g/L by increasing the
supply of the precursors acetyl-CoA and NADPH, as well as
optimizing the medium and culture conditions. Similarly, the
yield of 3-HP in the β-alanine pathway reached 13.7 g/L in the
controlled fed-batch fermentations at pH 5.0 by increasing the
supply of the precursors β-alanine and NADPH. Although both
approaches can yield over 10 g/L of 3-HP when implemented
in yeast, this is still far from the high titers needed for the
commercially viable production of commodity chemicals, which
typically starts at 100 g/L (Kumar et al., 2013). Malonyl-
CoA biosensors and genome-scale engineering tools can be
combined to improve the 3-HP production in yeast. Nevertheless,
although yeast is an intrinsically acid-tolerant host, which greatly
simpliﬁes the downstream process, developing an eﬀective and
economical 3-HP downstream puriﬁcation technology could also
improve the output of 3-HP after separation and puriﬁcation
(Li et al., 2015; Si et al., 2015, 2017; David et al., 2016; Bao
et al., 2018). Further optimization of the recombinant yeast
strains and development of more powerful separation techniques
could raise the titer and yield of 3-HP enough to enable
economically competitive bioproduction at an industrial scale in
the future.
