INTRODUCTION
Tofacitinib (Fig. 1A) is a Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 3 in-
hibitor that blocks the JAK signal transducer and activator 
of the transcription (STAT) signaling pathway (Srivastava et 
al., 2018). It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), par-
ticularly in cases where methotrexate is ineffective (Claxton 
et al., 2018; Fukuda et al., 2019). Approximately 70% of the 
oral dose of tofacitinib is metabolized by the hepatic micro-
somal cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2C19, with the 
remaining tofacitinib excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The 
terminal half-life of the drug is 3.2 h (Bannwarth et al., 2013; 
Dowty et al., 2014).
Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most commonly used 
over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic drugs (Yan et al., 
2018). However, APAP overdose is also the leading cause of 
acute liver injury (ALI) (Budnitz et al., 2011). Excessive APAP 
administration saturates its normal metabolic pathways, lead-
ing to the accumulation of the hepatotoxic metabolite, N-ace-
tyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI) (Qian et al., 2021). NAPQI 
depletes glutathione (GSH) in hepatocytes and forms toxic ad-
ducts with cellular proteins, causing oxidative stress and cell 
death (Bunchorntavakul and Reddy, 2013). APAP is still widely 
used to relieve inflammatory pain in patients with RA, particu-
larly in those who experience side effects from nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (Fitzcharles and Shir, 2011). Although 
the drug is safe in doses up to 2,000 mg per day, doses ex-

Tofacitinib, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) en-
zymes, CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11. Acetaminophen (APAP), which is frequently used for pain relief in patients with RA, can induce 
acute liver injury (ALI) when taken in excess, profoundly affecting drug metabolism. Resveratrol (RVT) is a polyphenolic com-
pound with hepatoprotective properties. This study investigated the protective effects of RVT against APAP-induced ALI in rats, 
and explored its influence on the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib. In ALI rats, both intravenous and oral administration of tofacitinib 
resulted in a significant (207% and 181%) increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), primarily driven 
by a substantial reduction (66.1%) in non-renal clearance (CL
NR) compared to that in control (CON) rats. Notably, RVT administra-
tion in ALI rats provided effective liver protection, partially restoring liver function, as evidenced by normalized glutamate oxaloac-
etate transaminase levels and the pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and CL
NR, closer to those observed in untreated CON rats 
(117% and 81.9%, respectively). These findings highlight the importance of considering the potential interactions between RVT or 
polyphenol-rich natural products and medications in patients with ALI in clinical practice.

ceeding this can often lead to liver damage (Popiolek et al., 
2021), which can then affect the metabolism of co-adminis-
tered drugs (Bollinger, 2017). Given that tofacitinib is primarily 
metabolized by the liver, liver function is a crucial consider-
ation in patients with RA, as severe inflammatory reactions in 
the liver can occur (Bae et al., 2022).
Resveratrol (RVT, Fig. 1B) is a polyphenolic compound 
abundant in grape skins, wine, and peanuts, and is known 
for its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects 
(Mbimba et al., 2012). Additionally, the hepatoprotective ef-
fects of RVT are mediated through antioxidant (Zhang et al., 
2015), anti-inflammatory (Jiang et al., 2016), anti-apoptotic 
(Shen et al., 2016), cell survival pathway activating (Baur and 
Sinclair, 2006), and antifibrotic effects (Gomez-Zorita et al., 
2012). Recent studies have reported the hepatoprotective 
effects of RVT in APAP-induced ALI (Gokkaya et al., 2022). 
However, studies on the pharmacokinetic changes of drugs 
influenced by the hepatoprotective effects of RVT remain lim-
ited.
This study aims to demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect 
of RVT in an APAP-induced ALI rats through the pharmaco-
kinetic changes of tofacitinib following intravenous and oral 
administration in ALI rats with or without RVT. In addition, this 
effect of RVT was also verified through the in vitro metabolic 
activity of tofacitinib and the protein expression changes of 
CYP isozymes involved in the metabolism of tofacitinib in the 
microsomes of the liver and intestine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Tofacitinib citrate, hydrocortisone (used as the internal 
standard for high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] 
analysis), and APAP were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA). RVT was procured from the Tokyo Chemi-
cal Industry (Tokyo, Japan). Ethyl acetate and acetonitrile, 
required for HPLC-based tofacitinib analysis, were supplied 
by J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA), and -cyclodextrin was 
obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Primary antibodies tar-
geting CYP3A1/2, CYP2E1, CYP2C11, CYP2D1, and CYP-
2BA1/2 were kindly provided by Detroit R&D Inc. (Detroit, MI, 
USA), while -actin (used as a loading control) was sourced 
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). All other 
chemicals were of HPLC or analytical grade and were used as 
received without further purification.
Animals
Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200-
230 g, were obtained from DBL (Incheon, Korea). Animals 
were housed individually under controlled conditions at the 
Laboratory Animal Research Center, Ajou University Medi-
cal Center (Suwon, Korea). Environmental conditions were 
regulated at 21-23°C with 45-55% relative humidity and a 
12-h light/dark cycle (07:00-19:00/19:00-07:00). Rats had un-
restricted access to food and water. All experimental proce-
dures adhered to the approved protocols of the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC No. 2023-0082) at 
the Laboratory Animal Research Center, Ajou University Medi-
cal Center.
Induction of ALI
Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CON), 
RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT. ALI was induced by administering a 
single intraperitoneal injection of APAP (400 mg/kg) dissolved 
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Du et al., 2015). The RVT 
group received a single intraperitoneal injection of RVT (50 
mg/kg) dissolved in 40% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in saline 
(Du et al., 2015). In the ALI-RVT group, 50 mg/kg RVT was in-
jected intraperitoneally 1.5 h before APAP administration (Du 
et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). The control group was treated 
with PBS only. Rats were euthanized for tissue collection or 
surgery 24 h after APAP injection (Elbe et al., 2018).
Biochemical profi le analysis and tissue microscopy
Plasma and 24-h urine samples were collected from the 
four groups of rats: CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT ( n=3 per 
group). Plasma levels of albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamate oxaloac-
etate transaminase (GOT), serum creatinine (S
CR), and total 
protein were analyzed (Green Cross Reference Lab, Seoul, 
Korea). Urine volume and creatinine concentration were mea-
sured to calculate creatinine clearance (CL
CR), as previously 
outlined (Choi et al., 2024). Liver and kidney weights were 
also recorded. For histopathological analysis, liver and kidney 
tissue sections were fixed in 10% formalin for biopsy.
Rat plasma protein binding of tofacitinib
The plasma protein binding of tofacitinib was assessed us-
ing freshly isolated plasma from the CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-
RVT groups (n=3 per group). Ultrafiltration was performed fol-
lowing a method similar to that previously described (Barre et 
al., 1985). Briefly, rat plasma spiked with 5 g/mL of tofacitinib 
was added to a Nanosep 10 K centrifugal filter unit (Pall Co., 
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 30 min. A 
100-L sample of the ultrafiltrate, containing the unbound frac-
tion of tofacitinib, was then frozen at –80°C until HPLC analy-
sis was performed (Kim et al., 2020). To account for non-spe-
cific binding to the filtration device, PBS (pH 7.4) containing 
an equivalent concentration of tofacitinib was subjected to the 
same conditions (n=3). The percentage of tofacitinib bound to 
plasma proteins was determined using the following formula:
/g5/g139/g144/g134/g139/g144/g137/g3/g936/g3 /g3404 /g3/g1829/g3021/g3398/g1829/g3007
/g1829/g3021
/g3400 /g883/g882/g882/g3                          (1)
where CF represents the concentration of the unbound drug in 
the ultrafiltrate and C T is the total drug concentration initially 
added to the ultrafiltration unit (Barre et al., 1985).
Intravenous and oral administration of tofacitinib in rats
The procedures for intravenous and oral administration, 
as well as rat pretreatment, were performed following previ-
ously established methods (Bae et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; 
Choi et al., 2024). The cannulae were inserted into the carotid 
artery for blood collection and into the jugular vein for drug 
administration. After cannulation, the rats were allowed a re-
covery period of 3-4 h before starting the experiments. The 
rats were allowed to move freely throughout the experiment.
For intravenous administration, tofacitinib (10 mg/kg), dis-
solved in saline containing 0.5% -cyclodextrin, was injected 
into the jugular vein over 1 min in the CON ( n=6), RVT (n=6), 
ALI (n=7), and ALI-RVT (n=7) groups. Blood samples were

collected from the carotid artery at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 5, 15, 30, 
45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min. Tofacitinib (20 mg/kg) 
was orally administered to CON ( n=6), RVT (n=6), ALI (n=6), 
and ALI-RVT (n=7) rats, and blood was collected at 0 (pre-
dose), 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, 600, 
and 720 min. Blood samples were centrifuged, and 50 L of 
plasma was stored at –80°C until HPLC analysis of tofacitinib 
was performed (Kim et al., 2020). At 24-h, urine output over 
24 h and the entire gastrointestinal tract were collected fol-
lowing the methods described in previous studies (Lee and 
Kim, 2019; Choi et al., 2024). After measuring the total volume 
of urine, a 100-L aliquot of both urine and gastrointestinal 
samples was taken and stored at –80°C until HPLC analysis 
(Kim et al., 2020).
Determination of the Vmax, Km, and CLint
Hepatic and intestinal microsomes were prepared accord-
ing to previously established methods (Duggleby, 1995; Choi 
et al., 2024). The in vitro metabolic activity was evaluated us-
ing microsomes extracted from the liver and intestines of rats 
in the CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT groups (n=3 per group). 
Microsomal protein concentrations were quantified using 
bicinchoninic acid assay. The in vitro system consisted of 1 
mg of microsomal protein, 1 L of DMSO containing tofacitinib 
(5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 M), and a nicotinamide ad-
enine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH)-generating 
system (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). To this, 0.1 M PBS 
(pH 7.4) was added for a final volume of 1 mL. The reaction 
mixture was incubated in a water bath shaker at 37°C with 50 
oscillations per minute for 15 min. The reaction was stopped 
by adding methanol at a volume twice that of the reaction mix-
ture. The kinetic parameters, including the maximum reaction 
velocity (V
max) and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant 
(Km, the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate 
is half of Vmax), were determined using nonlinear regression 
analysis (Duggleby, 1995; Bae et al., 2022; Choi et al., 2024). 
The intrinsic clearance (CL int) of tofacitinib was calculated by 
dividing Vmax by Km (Duggleby, 1995; Bae et al., 2022; Choi et 
al., 2024).
Immunoblot analysis
Microsomal proteins from liver and intestinal tissues (30-
50 g per lane) were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 
subsequently transferred onto membranes. The membranes 
were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies (di-
luted 1:2,000) targeting CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11, CYP2D1, 
CYP3A1/2, and -actin. The membranes were then incubated 
with a secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000) for 1 h at room 
temperature. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced 
chemiluminescence and their intensities were analyzed using 
ImageJ 1.45s software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
HPLC analysis
Biological samples for HPLC analysis of tofacitinib were 
prepared according to previously described methods (Kim et 
al., 2020). A 50 L aliquot from each sample was mixed with 
20% ammonia solution (20 L) containing hydrocortisone (10 
g/mL) as the internal standard, followed by extraction with 
ethyl acetate (750 L). The organic layer was then evaporated 
under a nitrogen stream. The residue was then re-dissolved, 
and 50 L of the resulting supernatant was injected onto a C
18 
reversed-phase column (250×4.6 mm, 5 m; Young Jin Bio-
chrom, Seongnam, Korea) for analysis using a Prominence 
LC-20A HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped 
with a UV detector set to 287 nm. The mobile phase consisted 
of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and acetonitrile 
at a ratio of 69.5:30.5 (v/v), at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The 
retention times of tofacitinib and hydrocortisone were approxi-
mately 7.2 min and 11.3 min, respectively. The lower limits 
of quantification for tofacitinib in rat plasma and urine were 
determined to be 0.01 and 0.1 g/mL, respectively. The in-
traday precision (coefficient of variation) for rat plasma and 
urine ranged from 3.69% to 5.88% and from 4.21% to 6.18%, 
respectively. The inter-day precision values were 5.06% for 
plasma and 5.46% for urine (Kim et al., 2020).
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the 
standard approach outlined by Gibaldi and Perrier (1982) via 
non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software (Phar-
sight Co., Mountain View, CA, USA). The area under the plas-
ma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity 
was estimated using the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation 
(Chiou, 1978). The peak plasma concentration (C
max) and time 
to reach Cmax (Tmax) were determined directly from the plasma 
concentration-time profiles. The absolute oral bioavailability 
(F) of tofacitinib was calculated by taking the ratio of the dose-
normalized AUC
oral to the dose-normalized AUCintravenous, where 
AUCoral refers to the AUC following oral administration, and 
AUCintravenous denotes the AUC following intravenous adminis-
tration.
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the 
four groups, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. A p-value of 
less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.
RESUL TS
Preliminary data and tissue microscopy
Fig. 2A illustrates the body weight, biochemical markers, 
plasma protein binding of tofacitinib, CL CR, and relative liver 
and kidney weights across the four rat groups. Liver dysfunc-
tion in ALI rats was evidenced by a 71.8% increase in GOT 
and a 4.01% reduction in total protein, compared to the CON 
group. RVT treatment in ALI-RVT rats substantially improved 
liver function compared to ALI rats, leading to a 35.1% de-
crease in GOT and a 4.50% increase in total protein (Fig. 
2A). Other indicators of liver function in ALI rats showed no 
major damage; albumin, GPT levels, and relative liver weight 
remained within normal ranges (Mitruka and Rawnsley, 1981), 
and were comparable among all groups. Similarly, renal func-
tion indicators, such as urea nitrogen, relative kidney weight, 
and CL
CR, were not impaired in ALI rats (Fig. 2A). Liver his-
tology showed widespread tissue damage and extensive cell 
death in the ALI rats (Fig. 2B). However, kidney histology re-
vealed no notable tissue damage. In ALI-RVT rats, RVT ad-
ministration alleviated tissue damage, as no significant dis-
turbances were detected in liver or kidney histology (Fig. 2B).

Plasma protein binding of tofacitinib
The plasma protein binding of tofacitinib was relatively sta-
ble across the CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT groups, with bind-
ing percentages of 63.7, 65.1, 64.2, and 63.6%, respectively 
(Fig. 2A). Additionally, the mean recovery rate of tofacitinib (5 
g/mL) in phosphate buffer following ultrafiltration was 99.7 ± 
2.51% (n=3), suggesting minimal non-specific binding to the 
filtration apparatus.

Intravenous and oral administration of tofacitinib in rats
Fig. 3A shows the mean arterial plasma concentration–time 
profiles of tofacitinib after intravenous administration of 10 mg/
kg in the CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT groups, along with the 
pharmacokinetic parameters listed in Table 1. Compared to 
the CON group, the ALI group showed significant alterations 
in tofacitinib pharmacokinetics, including a 207% increase in 
AUC, 113% increase in terminal half-life, and considerable re-
ductions in CL, CL
NR, and CLR (by 64.7%, 66.1%, and 70.8%, 
respectively). In the ALI-RVT rats, RVT administration notably 
improved all pharmacokinetic parameters, returning them to 
levels close to those in the CON group (Table 1). When com-
paring ALI and ALI-RVT rats, ALI-RVT rats exhibited a 62.0% 
reduction in AUC, 38.0% shorter terminal half-life, and signifi-
cant increases in CL, CL
NR, and CL R (by 142%, 141%, and 
398%, respectively), along with an 117% increase in the per-
centage of drugs excreted in an unchanged form in the urine 
after 24 h (Ae
0-24 h). Pharmacokinetic comparisons between 
the CON and RVT rats showed no significant differences.
Fig. 3B illustrates the mean arterial plasma concentration–
time curves for tofacitinib after oral administration of 20 mg/
kg in the four groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as 
AUC, CL
R, and Ae0-24 h for tofacitinib are summarized in Table 
2. Compared to CON rats, ALI rats showed an 161% increase 
in AUC and a 76.4% decrease in CL
R. However, ALI-RVT rats 
demonstrated notable improvements in pharmacokinetics, 
with values closer to those observed in CON rats. Specifically, 
the AUC decreased by 41.4%, whereas the CL
R increased by 
211%. The F values were similar across the four groups, and 
no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters 
were observed between the CON and RVT rats (Table 2).
In vitro metabolism of tofacitinib
Fig. 4A illustrates the Vmax, Km, and CL int values for the 
metabolism of tofacitinib in hepatic microsomes across the 
four experimental groups. The V
max in ALI rats showed a pro-
nounced reduction of 58.9% compared to that in the CON 
group. In contrast, the administration of RVT to ALI-RVT rats 
partially restored V
max to 85.1% of the value observed in CON 
rats. Km values remained consistent across all groups, indi-
cating that the affinity of the enzyme for tofacitinib remained 
unchanged. As a result, CL
int in ALI rats was 69.6% lower than 
that in CON rats, but was restored to 93.1% of CON values 
following RVT administration in the ALI-RVT group. These ob-
servations suggest that the hepatic metabolism of tofacitinib 
was impaired in ALI rats and improved upon co-administration 
of RVT.
In Fig. 4B, the V
max, Km, and CLint values for tofacitinib me-
tabolism in the intestinal microsomes are shown. Unlike he-
patic microsomes, no significant differences in V
max, Km, and 
CLint were observed across the four groups. This indicated that 
neither APAP-induced ALI nor RVT treatment affected the me-
tabolism of tofacitinib in intestinal microsomes.

in microsomes from CON, RVT, ALI, and ALI-RVT rats are 
shown in Fig. 5. In the hepatic microsomes of ALI rats, the 
expression levels of CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11, and CYP3A1/2 de-
creased by 24.3%, 58.3%, and 39.2%, respectively, compared 
to those in CON rats. However, in ALI-RVT rats, CYP2C11 ex-
pression increased by 41.5%, whereas CYP3A1/2 levels de-
creased by 35.9% compared with those in ALI rats. Unlike the 
liver findings, the intestinal microsomes of ALI rats showed el-
evated CYP2C11 and CYP3A1/2 levels, which were increased 
by 16.0% and 120%, respectively, compared to those in CON 
rats. Additionally, the expression of all CYP isozymes in intes-
tinal microsomes was higher in ALI-RVT rats than in ALI rats. 
These findings suggest that ALI significantly affects CYP iso-
zyme levels in both the hepatic and intestinal tissues, poten-
tially leading to reduced hepatic metabolism of tofacitinib. RVT 
treatment appeared to counteract these alterations, bringing 
CYP isozyme expression in both the liver and intestines closer 
to the levels observed under non-ALI conditions.
DISCUSSION
An APAP overdose is a common cause of ALI, accounting 
for 10-30% of ALI cases, making it a significant contributor to

drug-induced liver damage (Ahn, 2006). High doses of APAP 
result in increased production of its toxic intermediate metabo-
lite, NAPQI, which is usually neutralized by GSH and excreted 
through urine (Mossanen and Tacke, 2015). However, once 
GSH stores are depleted, excess NAPQI binds to mitochon-
drial proteins within the hepatocytes, leading to cellular dam-
age and hepatocellular necrosis (Jaeschke et al., 2020). Nat-
ural products offer potential protection against drug-induced 
liver damage, including that resulting from APAP overdose. 
RVT, a polyphenolic compound, has been shown to mitigate 
ALI (Sener et al., 2006), and pterostilbene, a compound in 
the same family, has demonstrated protective effects against 
APAP-induced liver injury (Fan et al., 2018).
In preliminary studies, the administration of RVT in ALI-RVT 
rats led to significant improvements in liver function compared 
to that in ALI rats, with key liver function markers, such as 
GOT and total protein levels and liver histology, trending to-
wards baseline levels in the CON group (Fig. 2). This suggests 
that RVT may mitigate APAP-induced liver damage and exert 
hepatoprotective effects. APAP overdose is known to induce 
severe oxidative stress in liver tissues, causing GSH deple-
tion and triggering oxidative injury, which is often associated 
with neutrophil infiltration (Guo et al., 2021). RVT counteracts 
oxidative stress, reduces neutrophil infiltration in tissues, in-
hibits hepatocellular death, and promotes liver regeneration 
by modulating the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway (Sener et al., 
2006; Wang et al., 2015). The reduction in final body weight 
in RVT rats is due to the conversion of white adipocytes into 
brown fat, which promotes liver fat reduction and weight loss 
(Zhou et al., 2019). For this reason, despite the improvement 
in liver function in ALI-RVT rats, their weight appears to have 
decreased even more than that of ALI rats. Consequently, our 
findings suggest that RVT protects against oxidative injury in 
liver tissues and limits neutrophil accumulation, thereby con-
tributing to the protective effects observed in ALI-RVT rats.
Tofacitinib exhibits dose-independent linear pharmacoki-
netics when administered intravenously or orally in the dose 
range of 10-50 mg/kg (Lee and Kim, 2019). Accordingly, the 
intravenous and oral doses were set at 10 and 20 mg/kg, re-
spectively. The substantial increase in AUC after intravenous 
tofacitinib administration in ALI rats was likely due to a signifi-
cant reduction in CL compared to that in the CON group (Table 
1). As the liver plays a central role in tofacitinib metabolism, 
the decrease in CL can be attributed to a reduction in CL
NR, 
which reflects metabolic clearance (Dowty et al., 2014; Lee 
and Kim, 2019). Considering that gastrointestinal and biliary 
excretion contribute minimally to tofacitinib clearance and that 
the drug remains chemically stable in gastric juice with limited 
enzymatic degradation (Kim et al., 2020), the observed reduc-
tion in CL
NR likely represents impaired hepatic metabolism of 
tofacitinib (Table 1).
Overdose with APAP depletes GSH and elevates reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production owing to the accumulation 
of the toxic metabolite NAPQI, which leads to inflammation 
and liver damage (Al Humayed et al., 2020; Xu and Wang, 
2023). This damage significantly impairs tofacitinib metabo-
lism, which is primarily mediated by hepatic CYP3A1/2 and 
CYP2C11 in rats (Lee and Kim, 2019). In the ALI rats, this 
resulted in a marked reduction in CL
NR, which was consider-
ably slower than that in the CON rats (Table 1). Tofacitinib 
has an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio of approximately 
42.0% in rats (Lee and Kim, 2019), indicating that its hepatic 
clearance is primarily influenced by CL
int and the fraction of 
unbound drug in the plasma, rather than by hepatic blood flow 
(Wilkinson and Shand, 1975). As the plasma protein binding 
of tofacitinib remained unchanged between ALI and CON rats, 
the reduced CL
NR in ALI rats was likely attributable to a signifi-
cant decrease in CLint rather than to alterations in the unbound 
fraction of the drug. Supporting this hypothesis, the protein ex-
pression of hepatic CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 in ALI rats was 
diminished, and hepatic CL
int was significantly reduced. How-
ever, following RVT treatment in ALI-RVT rats, pharmacoki-
netic parameters such as AUC, CL, and CL
NR recovered to lev-
els similar to those observed in CON rats. Interestingly, while 
RVT treatment restored overall drug metabolism, it selectively 
influenced different CYP isozymes; CYP2C11 expression in-
creased, while CYP3A1/2 expression decreased, compared 
to those in ALI rats. This selective modulation may indicate 
that RVT exerts an inhibitory effect on CYP3A1/2 expression, 
which was observed not only in ALI-RVT rats but also in RVT 
rats, where CYP3A expression slightly decreased following 
RVT administration. The inhibition of CYP3A1/2 could have 
implications for drug interactions and the metabolic process-
ing of compounds when co-administered with APAP (Hyrsova 
et al., 2019). In contrast, RVT administration upregulated CY-
P2C11 expression in ALI-RVT rats, which contributed to the 
recovery of hepatic enzyme activity to levels comparable to 
those in CON rats. This restoration of CYP2C11 expression 
likely enhances the key metabolic pathways for tofacitinib, 
resulting in the normalization of its pharmacokinetic param-
eters. In conclusion, RVT appears to offer significant hepato-
protective effects against APAP-induced liver damage, which, 
in turn, positively affects the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib. 
By mitigating the adverse effects of liver injury, RVT treatment 
in ALI-RVT rats led to pharmacokinetic parameters, such as 
AUC, CL, and CL
NR, that closely resembled those of CON rats, 
underscoring the therapeutic potential of RVT in liver protec-
tion and its role in modulating drug metabolism.
After the oral administration of tofacitinib to ALI rats, the sig-
nificantly greater AUC compared to that in CON rats suggests 
that reduced clearance, particularly CL
R, plays a critical role 
in this increase. Gastrointestinal absorption of tofacitinib was 
nearly complete in both CON and ALI rats, as evidenced by GI
24 
h values representing less than 0.791% that of the oral dose; 
however, the increased AUC in ALI rats cannot be explained

solely by changes in absorption. Instead, the marked reduc-
tion in CLR in ALI rats likely led to a decreased elimination rate, 
thereby contributing to the observed increase in AUC. How-
ever, the expression of intestinal CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 
was higher in ALI rats than in CON rats. This pattern aligns 
with the findings in other models, such as cisplatin-induced 
renal failure, in which intestinal CYP isozyme expression in-
creases (Bae et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2024). This phenom-
enon may be attributed to the higher sensitivity and instability 
of intestinal microsomes, as previously reported (Bruyère et 
al., 2009). Furthermore, there were no significant differences 
in CL
int among the four groups in the intestinal microsomes, 
suggesting that APAP-induced hepatotoxicity did not affect 
the intestinal metabolism of tofacitinib. This lack of intestinal 
involvement in tofacitinib metabolism aligns with the under-
standing that the toxic effects of APAP primarily target the liver 
rather than the gastrointestinal system. Hence, changes in to-
facitinib pharmacokinetics in ALI rats are more closely associ-
ated with hepatotoxicity than with gastrointestinal factors. The 
increased expression of CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 in intestinal 
microsomes is not exactly known, however, these changes do 
not appear to significantly affect the overall tofacitinib metabo-
lism in the gastrointestinal tract.
In a rat model of CCl
4-induced ALI, the metabolic activities 
of hepatic CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 were significantly reduced 
by 25% and 76%, respectively, indicating that liver injury sub-
stantially impairs the function of these CYP isozymes (Tan et 
al., 2008). This finding is consistent with the results observed 
in the APAP-induced ALI rat model, in which diminished CYP 
isozyme activity was also observed. Such reductions in the 
levels of liver CYP enzymes are common across different liver 
injury models. In clinical settings, a study demonstrated that 
the AUC of tofacitinib increased by 72.6% in patients with he-
patic impairment compared to that in healthy individuals af-
ter oral administration (10 mg) (Lawendy et al., 2014). This 
parallels preclinical findings, suggesting that impaired hepatic 
metabolism leads to slower elimination and higher systemic 
exposure to tofacitinib. These results emphasize the impor-
tance of considering dosage adjustments for tofacitinib in pa-
tients with liver injury to avoid potential toxicity and maintain 
therapeutic efficacy.
In summary, administration of RVT successfully restored 
hepatic CYP2C11 expression and enhanced CL
int in ALI-RVT 
rats, normalizing tofacitinib metabolism to levels comparable 
to those in CON rats. These findings underscore the need to 
consider drug interactions involving natural compounds in 
clinical settings, especially in patients with liver disease. Natu-
ral extracts containing RVT or other polyphenols may influ-
ence the plasma concentrations of concurrently administered 
drugs. Thus, incorporating RVT could not only provide liver 
protective effects but also help mitigate increases in plasma 
levels of co-administered medications resulting from liver 
damage, ultimately preventing adverse effects linked to el-
evated drug concentrations.
