Imine reductases (IREDs) are important biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. However,
a detailed understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism of IRED remains incomplete, making the design
of IRED for producing the desired amine enantiomers challenging. In this study, we investigated the
stereoselective catalytic mechanism and designed an ( R)-stereoselective IRED from Paenibacillus
mucilaginosus (PmIR) using pharmaceutically relevant 2-aryl-substituted pyrrolines as substrates. A
putative mechanism for controlling stereoselectivity was proposed based on the crucial role of
electrostatic interactions in controlling iminium cation orientation and employed to achieve complete
inversion of stereoselectivity inPmIR using computational design. The variantPmIR-Re (Q138M/P140M/
Y187E/Q190A/D250M/R251N) exhibited opposite (S)-stereoselectivity, with >96% enantiomeric excess
(ee) towards tested 2-aryl-substituted pyrrolines. Computational tools were employed to identify
stabilizing mutations at the interface between the two subunits. The variantPmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/
R251N/Q217E/A257R/T277M) showed a nearly 5-fold increase in activity and a 12 °C increase in melting
temperature. The PmIR-6P successfully produced (R)-2-(2,5-diﬂuorophenyl)-pyrrolidine, a key chiral
pharmaceutical intermediate, at a concentration of 400 mM with an ee exceeding 99%. This study
provides insight into the stereocontrol elements of IREDs and demonstrates the potential of
computational design for tailored stereoselectivity and thermal stability.
Introduction
Imine reductase (IRED) plays an important role as a biocatalyst
in the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure amines, and it
exhibits the ability to catalyze various transformations,
including cyclic imine asymmetric reduction, direct asymmetric
reductive amination, and stepwise conjugate reduction fol-
lowed by reductive amination.
1–3 Despite the diverse reactions
catalyzed by IREDs, they all involve a pivotal step: the asym-
metric reduction of the iminium cation intermediate.4,5 This
step is crucial for determining the stereoconguration of the
nal amine product.
The understanding of the specic roles of varying active-site
residues in stereocontrol remains limited. To gain insight into
the correlation between active site residues and stereo-
selectivity, multiple studies have compared IREDs exhibiting
stereocomplementary activity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline and
other cyclic imines.
6–8 These investigations have led to the
categorization of IREDs into two groups based on their opposite
stereoselectivities and the putative catalytic residues involved.
Y-type IREDs possess tyrosine as a potential proton-donating
amino acid, whereas D-type IREDs feature aspartate at equiva-
lent position. Although it seemed that the diﬀerent putative
catalytic residues, tyrosine and aspartate, led to opposite ster-
eoselectivity of the IREDs, there remain exceptions. In 2015,
Wetzl and coworkers reported IREDs that possessed phenylal-
anine or asparagine residues at equivalent positions.
9 In 2016,
Turner et al.reported an intriguingnding withAoIRED, which
demonstrated higher activity and stereoselectivity in asym-
metric imine reduction despite the absence of tyrosine or
aspartate residues.
10 These discoveries suggest that potentially
diﬀerent stereocontrol mechanisms are formed by distinct
active sites in IREDs. The varying active-site residues and
unidentied key stereocontrol elements make the rational
design of an IRED for the desired stereoselectivity challenging.
Additionally, stability has been emphasized as a crucial factor in

the practical application of evolved IREDs.2,11,12 The conven-
tional approach for mass screening in directed evolution is
time-consuming. However, a rational design approach for
improving stereoselectivity and stability remains
underdeveloped.
In this study, we investigated the possible stereocontrol
mechanism of IRED in Paenibacillus mucilaginosus (PmIR).
Furthermore, by employing rational design with catalytic
constraints based on a putative stereocontrol mechanism, we
successfully reversed the stereoselectivity ofPmIR towards 2-
(2,5-diuorophenyl)pyrroline (2-DFPL) and other 2-aryl-
substituted pyrrolines in thePmIR-Re variant. PmIR-Re repre-
sents therst instance of overcoming the boundary between Y-
type- and D-type IREDs, provides valuable insights into the key
stereocontrol elements of IREDs, and demonstrates an eﬀective
mechanism-guided approach for manipulating stereo-
selectivity. Furthermore, a combinational method including
salt-bridge construction andDDG
fold prediction was applied to
enable the rapid identi cation of interface mutations for
stability enhancement. Finally, the engineered variantPmIR-6P
was used to successfully produce ( R)-2-(2,5-diuorophenyl)-
pyrrolidine (2-DFPD), a key chiral intermediate of laro-
trectinib, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.
Results and discussion
A putative stereoselective control mechanism inPmIR
Although the imine reduction step is crucial for determining
the stereoconguration of the product in IRED-catalyzed reac-
tions, the role of active-site residues in stereoselective catalysis
remains elusive. Several studies have proposed that protic
residues, including conserved aspartate and tyrosine located
near the NADPH cofactor, serve as proton donors and facilitate
the transfer of protons necessary for the reduction of unsatu-
rated imine bonds.
5,8 Furthermore, most IREDs possess either
aspartate or tyrosine residues at equivalent positions in the
active site, which frequently display opposite stereoselectivity.
6–8
This suggests that these residues not only serve as proton
donors but also play a role in controlling stereoselectivity.
However, it should be noted that there are many exceptions to
this hypothesis. For instance, AoIRED exhibited high activity
and stereoselectivity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline despite
having an N171 residue in a position equivalent to aspartate or
tyrosine, suggesting that a protic residue at this position is not
essential for catalysis.
9 Conservation analysis of the IRED
database (https://ired.biocatnet.de/) also revealed that neither
aspartate nor tyrosine residues are completely conserved
among IREDs.
13,14 This indicates that a proton donor may not
be necessary for catalysis, and that the residues may play
diﬀerent roles. From the perspective of the imine substrate,
when the buﬀer pH is lower than the pK
a, the nitrogen atom
of the imine is protonated to form an iminium cation in the
solution. Therefore, we speculated that the active-site residues
in certain IREDs could merely play a role in binding the
protonated iminium cation in a reactive conformation, posi-
tioning the specicC ]N face at an appropriate distance from
NADPH. Subsequently, the chirality of the product was
determined by transferring a hydride ion from NADPH to
a prochiral carbon atom on the C]N face (Scheme 1).
Aer screening IREDs stored in our laboratory,PmIR from
Paenibacillus mucilaginosusemerged as one of the few enzymes
capable of catalyzing the reduction of 2-DFPL to yield (R)-2-
DFPD, which displayed the highest ee, exceeding 96%. Owing to
the conserved binding position of NADPH in IREDs,
5,7,13 the
PmIR-NADPH complex model was constructed by super-
imposing the PmIR crystal structure (PDB ID: 8KFK) on the
NADPH-bound BcSIRED crystal structure (sequence identity
75.8%). To investigate the key residues ofPmIR controlling the
asymmetric reduction, 18 residues around Y187 within 10 Å,
located at the subunit interface forming the binding pocket,
were targeted for alanine scanning (Fig. S1 and Table S2†). Next,
key residues with potential catalytic roles that dramatically
aﬀected the activity or stereoselectivity were subjected to
directed mutagenesis to further investigate their role in asym-
metric reduction (Table 1). Alanine scanning results indicated
that the M194A, F194A, F232A, and F234A mutations led to
negligible activity. Both D250A and W195A mutations resulted
in a complete loss of activity. The alanine mutation of the
potential proton donor Y187, which is oen considered catalytic
and conserved in IREDs, displayed a low yet detectable
conversion with an almost racemic ee of 4%, suggesting the
possible role of a bulky aromatic side chain in activity and
stereoselectivity. To further elucidate the contribution of the
phenolic hydroxyl group of Y187 to imine reduction, the Y187F
mutant was constructed. The Y187F mutant exhibited
a conversion of 34%, slightly lower than that observed for the
WT (46.5%), but stereoselectivity increased from 96% to >99%.
Enzymatic kinetic analysis of the Y187F mutant revealed a 3.6-

fold increase inKM but only a 24% reduction inkcat compared
with those in the WT (Table 2). The predicted pKa of 2-DFPL is
6.60 ± 0.20 (CAS Scinder), suggesting that at least 75% of the
substrate exists in the form of the iminium cation in the reac-
tion pH of 6.0. In summary, the catalytic activity of the Y187F
mutant and its decreased substrate aﬃnity suggest that Y187 in
PmIR primarily contributes to substrate binding during catal-
ysis, rather than serving as a proton donor, which diﬀers from
the previously reported role of tyrosine at equivalent positions
in other IREDs. This indicates that Y187 is a modiable residue
that can be used for further enzyme design.
Aspartate is another residue oen considered catalytically
active in IREDs. A previous report of a fungal IRED catalyzing
imine reduction and reductive amination indicated the impor-
tant role of the Asp active site in binding an imine cation and
amine substrate.
4 A systematic evaluation of imine-reducing
enzymes by Pleiss et al. suggested that most IREDs require
a negative electrostatic potential for substrate-binding. 8
Residue D250 ofPmIR was positioned above Y187, located in the
binding pocket, and close to NADPH. A complete loss of activity
was observed in the D250A mutant with no detectable products.
Saturation mutagenesis was performed to investigate the role of
D250. Most mutations resulted in complete inactivation, except
for D250E, which featured a carboxyl group with one additional
methyl moiety compared with aspartate. The D250E mutant
exhibited a comparable ee value,k
cat, and slightly reducedKM
values (Table 2). The optimal reaction pH forPmIR was deter-
mined to be 6.0, corresponding to the deprotonated state of the
acidic residues. Therefore, the complete inactivation of the
alanine mutation suggests that the loss of activity is primarily
due to the absence of a negatively charged deprotonated
carboxyl group. Furthermore, using the previously reported (R)-
selective BcSIRED
17 catalyzing 2-DFPL with 89% conversion and
88% ee, negligible conversion (1.7%) and relatively high
conversion (19%) were observed withBcSIRED mutants D251A

ndings observed forPmIR. Multiple sequence alignments of
eight IREDs displaying ( R)-stereoselectivity towards 2-aryl-
substituted pyrrolines also revealed that D250 is conserved in
certain IRED subgroups (Fig. 1A). Electrostatic interactions
between the negatively charged D250 and iminium cation
during catalysis cannot be excluded inPmIR.
Several studies speculated that conformational changes and
domain motion of IREDs can aﬀect stereoselectivity.
9,10,17 The
crystal structure alone may have limitations in that it cannot
reect important motions. Although the crystal structure indi-
cated that the carboxyl group of D250 was not ideally positioned
to interact with the iminium cation, MD simulations revealed
that D250 was in a exible binding loop (residues 242–251)
(Fig. S3†), and conformational reorientation of the D250 side
chain was observed during 100 ns simulations of substrate-free
PmIR (Fig. 1B). This reorientation suggests that the carboxyl
group could dynamically adjusts to accommodate the positive
iminium cation, stabilizing it in a reactive conformation and
promoting hydride transfer. Hence, D250 was selected as
a exible residue for molecular docking. The docking results
indicate preferential binding of the substrate in the pro-R pose
with electrostatic interaction to the D250 side chain (Fig. 1C), as
a lower interaction energy of pro-R pose than pro-S pose (−31.9
vs. −27.2 kcal mol
−1) was observed. The Y187, F232, F194, and
W195 form a hydrophobic region that stabilizes 2-DFPL
aromatic ring binding, which could explain why alanine muta-
tions at these sites resulted in inactive or low activities. These
interactions could position the specicC ]N face at an appro-
priate distance from NADPH.
Based on the importance of electrostatic interactions and
hydride transfer during reduction, the distances between the
imine nitrogen atom and the D250 carboxyl carbon atom (d1),
and the distance between the imine carbon and NADPH-C4 (d2)
are critical for catalysis. Electrostatic interactions can be strong,
even at relatively long distance.
20,21 The ternary complex of
AoIRED has been previously reported, which revealed a binding
site for the amine product that placed the chiral carbon within
4.0 Å of the C4 atom of NADPH.
9 In addition, studies of enzymes
such as short-chain dehydrogenase, which catalyzes bio-
reduction using NADPH as a cofactor, reported that hydride
transfer could happen when the distance between the NADPH-
C4 atom and electrophile carbon is# 4.5 Å,
22–24 and a few of
them show moderate imine-reducing activity. 8 Therefore,
conformations of d1 less than 5.0 Å and d2 less than 4.0 Å were
considered reactive. Based on these two distance criteria, MD
simulations of the docking complex demonstrated the high
occurrence of a reactive conformation in the pro-R pose of the
protonated 2-DFPL (Fig. 1C). These ndings suggest that
negatively charged acidic residues play a role in promoting the
formation of reactive pro-R positions during catalysis. There-
fore, based on the results of site-directed mutagenesis and MD
simulations, we inferred that D250 is a crucial residue for
stereocontrol inPmIR.
Based on the abovendings, we propose a putative mecha-
nism for stereocontrol, in which the electrostatic interaction
between the negatively charged side chains of Asp or Glu and
the iminium cation governs the orientation of the pyrroline
face, thereby determining the stereocon guration of the
product. To manipulate the stereoselectivity, we hypothesized
that the orientation of the 1-pyrroline face could be reversed by
simply introducing new electrostatic interactions in the oppo-
site direction, considering that a proton transfer system or any
anked residues that lower the pK
a value of the proton donor
are unnecessary. Because the residues at positions 250 and 187
are adjacent to each other and close to the nicotinamide moiety
of NADPH, we speculated that replacing Y187 with an acidic
amino acid could create an electrostatic interaction in the
opposite direction, thereby altering the orientation of the 1-
pyrroline face. The side chains of aspartate and glutamate in the
model compounds, with the titratable residue in the middle
and two alanines on each side, are determined experimentally
by previous study in water, yielding pK
a values of 3.6 and 4.2,
respectively.25 The protonation state of these residues was taken
into consideration to ensure that most of the side chain was
negatively charged in the protein. Using a p Ka predicting
module in Discovery Studio 4.0,26 the pKa value of Y187E was
predicted as 5.4 with a 1.2 shi compared with glutamate in
water, and Y187D was predicted as 4.7 with a 1.1 shi compared
with aspartate in water, indicating a negative electrostatic
potential at pH 6.0. As anticipated, the Y187D mutation resulted
in a dramatically reduced ee to 58%, but a negligible conver-
sion. The Y187E mutation successfully resulted in slightly
reversed (S)-stereoselectivity with an ee of 33% (Table 1),
providing further evidence for the crucial role of electrostatic
interactions in stereoselective control. The docking results were
in accordance with the proposed stereoselective control mech-
anism, as a pro-S pose was observed in the Y187E variant
complex using the 2-DFPL iminium as the substrate, showing
an opposite orientation to the 1-pyrroline face (Fig. 2).

Complete reversion of stereoselectivity using computational
design
Based on the proposed stereocontrol mechanism, the pro-S
pose of 2-DFPL can be generated by inverting the pyrroline face
and stabilizing it through electrostatic interactions. To achieve
this, a computational design strategy utilizing Rosetta Enzyme
Design was employed,
27 which is e ﬀective in placing the
substrate in the enzyme's active site with the desired confor-
mation.28 By applying catalytic geometric constraints, a reactive
conformation in the pro-S pose could be achieved and stabilized
through the active-site redesign. MD simulations were used to
narrow down variants for experimental validation. Variant
structures that exhibited a higher occurrence of reactive
conformations were selected for experimental validation,
thereby reducing the need for laboratory screening (Fig. 3).
Encouraged by the putative stereoselective control mecha-
nism and 33% ee observed for the Y187E variant, we used
a complex with the pro-S pose in the reactive conformation from
MD simulations as the initial structure for the redesign to
enhance (S)-stereoselectivity and activity simultaneously. To
achieve the distances, angles and dihedrals between Y187E and
substrate and NADPH for the catalytic geometric constraints,
the cluster model with 2-DFPL in the pro-S pose was optimized
to determine the transition state (TS) structure (Fig. S4 and
Table S3†). We focused on redesigning the loop residues
surrounding 2-DFPL, including V249, D250, and R251 in loops
242–251, and Q138 and P140 in loops 135–140. Additionally, we
included Q190 in the design because Q190A displayed a higher
conversion than the WT in previous alanine scanning. The
hydrophobic region formed by F232, F194, and W195 that
stabilizes 2-DFPL aromatic ring binding was not selected for
design. A virtual library with 30 000 mutant structures was
generated using the Rosetta Design to explore the sequence and
conformation space and optimize the catalytic interactions.
These structures were then sort based on the Rosetta parame-
ters of Total Score, Constraint Energy, and Interface Energy.
The top four non-redundant variants, 5352, 6645, 25 658,
and PmIR-Re, were further analyzed to determine the occur-
rence of reactive pro-S conformations using MD simulations.
Experimental validations were conducted for 5352 andPmIR-
Re, which showed a relatively high probability of adopting the
pro-S pose in the reactive conformation. Both variants exhibited
signicant improvements in stereoselectivity, producing (S)-2-
DFPD in 93% ee and >99% ee, respectively. Interestingly, the
D250S and D250M mutations, which resulted in a complete loss
of activity in the WT, were present in the two active variants,
suggesting that E187 replaced D250 to anchor the iminium
cation. Importantly, this observation further supports the
hypothesis that the inactivation caused by D250S and D250M in
the WT can be attributed to the absence of electrostatic inter-
actions rather than destabilization of the protein structure.
The initial complex used for design demonstrated that the
lack of tyrosine bulky side chain and electrostatic interaction
with Y187E resulted in a lower binding position of the pro-S
pose (Fig. S5†). In contrast, the side-chain repacking of Q190A
and Q138M in PmIR-Re elevated 2-DFPL binding position,

allowing for better interaction with the hydrophobic and
aromatic regions formed by F232, F194, and W195. The P140M
side chain could also push substrate into the aromatic region
and the D250M could form ap–sulphur interaction with 2-DFPL
from above. In addition, the PmIR-Re complex displayed
a geometric feature that more closely resembled the TS struc-
ture than the initial design template, potentially enhancing the
hydride transfer process (Table S4†). This observation indicates
that the increased S-stereoselectivity and activity achieved by
PmIR-Re could be due to the more reactive conformation for
hydride transfer while retaining the electrostatic interaction
with Y187E. These results further support the idea that the
stereoselectivity of PmIR can be directly manipulated by
creating electrostatic interactions in opposite directions,
thereby reversing the orientation of the 1-pyrroline face.
To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have inves-
tigated the stereoselective control mechanisms of imine reduc-
tion reactions. Several studies have compared IREDs that display
stereo-complementary activity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline and
have categorized them into Y-type and D-type IREDs based on
their stereoselectivity and putative catalytic residues (tyrosine or
aspartate).
6,7 In a recent study by Pleisset al., the stereoselectivity
of a D-type IRED fromMyxococcus stipitatustowards 2-methyl-1-
pyrroline was reversed.29 They obtained a variant with the oppo-
site stereoselectivity and 91% ee through site-saturation muta-
genesis. In this case, the stereoselectivity switch was attributed to
ad iﬀerence in the conformation of the nicotinamide moiety of
NADPH rather than the substrate-binding conformation. More
recently, Himo emphasized the importance of steric clashes in
the transition-state energy of the pro-R and pro-S complexes of
AoIRED.
30 The pro-S conformation, which lacked steric repulsion,
resulted in a lower energy state and led to (S)-stereoselectivity
towards bulky imine substrates. These results suggest that
varying the active sites of IREDs oﬀers multiple possibilities for
ne-tuning the relative spatial positions of the imine and nico-
tinamide groups of the cofactors.
In this study, we crossed the boundary between Y-type and D-
type IREDs by redesigning Y-typePmIR into a D/E-type enzyme
with opposite stereoselectivity. PmIR-Re represents an engi-
neered IRED with completely reversed stereoselectivity (>99%
ee) achieved through mechanism-guided computational
design. In contrast to the previously reported residues W210 in
AspRedAm
31 and W234/F260 in IRED-M5,32 which potentially
aﬀect stereoselectivity by steric hindrance of the bulky side
chain, the stereoselectivity in PmIR could be controlled by
electrostatic interactions between the iminium cation and the
acidic amino acids adjacent to the nicotinamide moiety of
NADPH. Therefore, the stereoselectivity of IREDs can be
tailored through rational reconstruction of electrostatic inter-
actions and reshaping of the binding pocket.
Engineering PmIR with interface stabilization
Only a few engineered IREDs have been reported to meet
industrial requirements, with the complete conversion of
substrates at concentrations exceeding 50 g L
−1.2,12,33–36 Stability
is an important factor in determining the overall turnover of
imine reduction, making IREDs suitable for industrial
processes. IREDs must exhibit high stability and tolerate high
substrate concentrations, organic cosolvents, and high reaction
temperatures. Furthermore, evidence suggests that proteins
that are stable under one type of denaturing condition tend to
be stable under other types.
37 Therefore, improving the stability
of naturally occurring IREDs is crucial for industrial applica-
tions. Recently, directed evolution approaches have been
employed to engineerScIR with signicantly increased activity
and thermal stability towards 2-DFPL.
35 This resulted in the
development of a practical enzymatic process for the produc-
tion of (R)-2-DFPD. However, extensive screening is inevitable in
directed evolution, which increases the cost and time required.
In this study, PmIR was engineered to investigate rational
design strategies for the rapid identication of mutations that
improve its thermal stability.
The PmIR structure is composed of reciprocal homodimers
consisting of an N-terminal Rossman fold domain and a C-
terminal helical domain connected by a long interdomain
helix. The two subunits are held together by interacting helices,
and it is noteworthy that the residues from both subunits
contribute to the formation of the binding pocket (Fig. S1†).
Natural salt bridges were also observed in IREDs on the surface
between the two subunits, providing stability to the dimeric
structure.
38 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that
enhanced subunit interactions would result in more stable
variants. Herein, we employed a comprehensive approach to
obtain a stable variant,PmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E/
A257R/T277M), which involved identifying interface mutations
through alanine scanning, designing salt bridges between
interfaces, and identifying mutations using DDG
fold calcula-
tions (Table 3).
The previous alanine scanning revealed that the interface
residues P140, Q190, and R251 demonstrated higher conver-
sions than the WT (Table S2†). Saturation mutagenesis was
conducted to identify the most benecial mutations at each site.
Additive eﬀects of multiple mutations were also investigated
(Table S5†). As a result, variant P140A/Q190S/R251N showed
a 4.5-fold increase in catalytic eﬃciency with ee exceeding 99%
compared to the WT. The puried variant also exhibited aTm of
57.2 °C, which was 5.1 °C higher than that of the WT. These
ndings are consistent with previous reports on evolved IREDs,
where mutations in the binding pocket not only increased
activity, but also improved stability.
29,31 These dual eﬀects may
be attributed to enhanced subunit interactions, resulting in
a more compact active pocket that stabilizes substrate binding.
Based on the geometric criteria for salt bridges (Fig. S5†) and
the crystal structure ofPmIR, potential residue pairs that met
the requirements for salt bridge formation were identi ed.
Residues withB-factors above the average value were selected as
candidates for designing salt bridges. A257 and Q217 were
mutated to A257R and Q217E, respectively, which introduced
a salt bridge between R257 and D87, and between E217 and
R176. The two new salt bridges increasedT
m by 1.8 °C and 1.5 °
C, respectively.
In silico saturation mutagenesis was performed for each
residue of PmIR, and theDDGfold values were calculated using

FoldX and Rosetta_ddg to generate point mutation structures.
To narrow down the large number of variants for experimental
validation, we performed MD simulations and visual inspection
on variants below cut-o ﬀ. The variants exhibited reduced
DDGfold values, lower localexibility than the original residues
(DZ-score <0), and no obvious structural undesirable mutations
were selected for experimental validation (Table S6†). Among
the 12 single mutations tested, four variants (G143M, G143W,
T277M, and T277L) showed higher residual activity than the
template aer incubation at 60 °C. G143M and T277M, which
had higher residual activity, were further puried to determine
their T
m values (Table 3). Thisin silicoworkow allowed for the
rapid identication of mutations with a higher likelihood of
enzyme stabilization and has been successful in several
biocatalysts.
39–41 However, there is a risk that certain mutations
may increase stability at the expense of reduced activity.
Although the G143M mutant exhibited a higher T
m, it also
showed a signicant reduction in activity. Therefore, it was not
included in thenal variant. Finally, mutations identied from
alanine scanning, salt bridge design, andDDGfold prediction
were combined, resulting in the highly stable variantPmIR-6P,
which exhibited a 12 °C increase inTm, from 52.1 to 64.1 °C
(Fig. S9†).
The highest specic activity ofPmIR-6P was observed at an
optimal reaction temperature of 35 °C (Fig. S10A†). At this
temperature, the kinetic parameters KM and kcat were deter-
mined to be 0.92 mM and 2.01 s−1, respectively, showing a 4.7-
fold increase in catalytic eﬃciency compared with the WT. The
half-lives of both the WT andPmIR-6P variants were measured
to assess their kinetic stability. At 35 °C,PmIR-6P exhibited an
8.4-fold improvement in half-life compared to the WT,
increasing from 47.5 h to 396.0 h. Furthermore, PmIR-6P
exhibited a half-life of 280.6 h at 40 °C (Fig. S10B†).
MD simulations revealed a signi cant diﬀerence in the
radius of gyration and root mean squareuctuation (RMSF)
between the WT and PmIR-6P at 308 K (35 °C). PmIR-6P
exhibited a more compact structure, which was attributed to
mutations at the subunit interface (Fig. 4A). The RMSF of WT
and PmIR-6P was calculated and compared (Fig. S11†). It indi-
cated that the most region ofPmIR-6P with a less exibility

during simulation compared with WT. Interestingly, the 242–
251 binding loop of PmIR -6P was observed with a higher
mobility than WT, which suggested the loop motion might
aﬀect activity forPmIR.
The distance between the backbone Ca atoms of Q217-R176
(Fig. 4B) and D87-R257 (Fig. 4C) clearly indicate that the salt
bridges stretched the two subunits more tightly than in the WT.
These ndings suggest that subunit dissociation plays a crucial
role in the irreversible inactivation of IREDs. This characteristic
has also been observed inu-transaminases, where stabilizing
mutations are predominantly located at the interface of the two
subunits as the active pocket is formed there.
41 Therefore,
focusing on the subunit interfaces of IREDs may be eﬀective for
identifying stabilizing mutations.
Previously reported engineered IREDs were mostly stabilized
through directed evolution involving extensive screening. For
example, 256 of 296 amino acid positions of IR-46 fromSac-
charothrix espanaensis were subjected to single-site saturation
mutagenesis and screening before the best variant was identi-
ed.
36 Similarly, SpRedAm from Streptomyces purpureus was
engineered to produce cis-cyclobutyl-N-methylamine, with 93
sites (out of 296) selected for single-site saturation mutagenesis
and screening.
34 Additionally, in the case ofScIR fromStrepto-
myces clavuligerus, signicantly increased activity and stabili-
zation were achieved by screening 52 sites.35 These examples
demonstrated the power of directed evolution in IRED engi-
neering. However, a rational design approach that requires
signicantly less screening than the conventional directed
evolution still needs to be developed for IREDs. In this study, we
combined diﬀerent computational tools to enhance the thermal
stability of IREDs and signicantly reduce the library size for
experimental testing. Furthermore, our results suggested that
the subunit interface, including the binding pocket, plays
a crucial role in stabilizing IREDs.
Comparison of substrate scope
To compare the catalytic properties of WT,PmIR-6P, andPmIR-
Re, their stereoselectivities and activities towards diﬀerent 2-
aryl-substituted pyrrolines were determined (Fig. 5). Higher
activity was observed in the reduction of substrates withmeta-
and ortho-uorine substitutions on the benzene ring. In
contrast, low activity was observed for substrates with para-
substitution. The substrate scope was expanded as the WT
showed no activity towardpara-uorine-substituted substrates,
whereas PmIR-6P displayed measurable activity. Furthermore,
PmIR-6P exhibited higher activity towards all tested substrates
than the WT. The stereoselectivity was strictly maintained as
(R)-stereoselectivity for all the tested substrates. Engineered
PmIR-6P is a promising biocatalyst for the production of bulky
substituted pyrrolidines. In contrast,PmIR-Re achieved high (S)-
stereoselectivity, with an ee exceeding 96% towards all tested
pyrrolidines. It also demonstrated an expanded substrate scope
compared with that of the WT. These results indicate that the
designed PmIR-Re exhibited complete (S)-stereoselectivity in
catalyzing imine reduction towards various 2-aryl-substituted
pyrrolines.
Gram-scale preparation of ( R)-2-DFPD. To evaluate the
industrial potential of the stable variantPmIR-6P, we conducted
a comparative analysis of the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-2-
DFPD using PmIR-6P and the WT (Fig. 6). The WT achieved
complete conversion within 8 h at a substrate concentration of

150 mM. However, due to its limited activity and stability, only
81% conversion was achieved when the substrate concentration
was increased to 200 mM. In contrast, PmIR-6P achieved
complete conversion of 200 mM substrate within 6 h.PmIR-6P
also exhibited its capability to produce valuable (R)-2-DFPD at
400 mM (72.4 g L−1) with a high ee and complete conversion.
Aer an 8 h reaction on a 100 mL scale, 5.8 g of (R)-2-DFPD was
obtained with an ee exceeding 99% and an 80% isolated yield.
These ndings highlight the potential of engineeredPmIR-6P as
a biocatalyst for the production of larotrectinib intermediates.
Conclusions
The putative stereoselective control mechanism proposed in
this study enabled the successful reversion of (R)-stereoselective
PmIR through computational design. The engineered variant,
PmIR-Re (Q138M/P140M/Y187E/Q190A/D250M/R251N), exhibi-
ted remarkably opposite stereoselectivities, yielding (S)-2-aryl-
substituted pyrrolidines. Through the redesign of Y-typePmIR
into a D/E-type variant with opposing stereoselectivity,PmIR-Re
stands as the rst instance of transcending the boundary
between Y-type and D-type IREDs. The electrostatic interaction
between the iminium cation and negatively charged residues
could be crucial for stereocontrol. Furthermore, computational
design of PmIR-Re revealed that, in IREDs, constraining the
relative position of the C]N moiety between D/E carboxyl group
and it between the nicotinamide moiety allows tailoring the pro-
S or pro-R pose of the substrate using Rosetta applications. This
enables in silicocustomization of stereoselectivity with reduced
screening eﬀorts. Despite the successful revision of stereo-
selectivity, the practical application ofPmIR in the synthesis of
chiral amines requires improvement. An approach combining
the salt-bridge construction, DDG
fold calculation, and alanine
scan was employed to enhance stability. Using this approach,
a six-point mutant, PmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E/
A257R/T277M), was generated, resulting in a signi cant
improvement in stability and an almost 5-fold increase in
enzymatic activity. ThePmIR-6P exhibited a substantial 12 °C
increase in T
m. The optimized PmIR-6P variant was highly
eﬀective in preparing a key intermediate for larotrectinib
synthesis, achieving high substrate loading. This study provides
valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the stereo
control of IREDs. This also demonstrates the potential of
computational enzyme design to tailor stereochemical
outcomes and optimize the stability of enzymatic reactions.
