ABSTRACT: TfCa, a promiscuous carboxylesterase from Thermobifida
fusca, was found to hydrolyze polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
degradation intermediates such as bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (MHET). In this
study, we elucidated the structures of TfCa in its apo form, as well as in
complex with a PET monomer analogue and with BHET. The structure−
function relationship of TfCa was investigated by comparing its hydrolytic
activity on various ortho- and para-phthalate esters of different lengths.
Structure-guided rational engineering of amino acid residues in the
substrate-binding pocket resulted in the TfCa variant I69W/V376A (WA),
which showed 2.6-fold and 3.3-fold higher hydrolytic activity on MHET
and BHET, respectively, than the wild-type enzyme. TfCa or its WA
variant was mixed with a mesophilic PET depolymerizing enzyme variant [
Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) PM] to degrade PET substrates of
various crystallinity. The dual enzyme system with the wild-type TfCa or its WA variant produced up to 11-fold and 14-fold more
terephthalate (TPA) than the single IsPETase PM, respectively. In comparison to the recently published chimeric fusion protein of
IsPETase and MHETase, our system requires 10% IsPETase and one-fourth of the reaction time to yield the same amount of TPA
under similar PET degradation conditions. Our simple dual enzyme system reveals further advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness
and catalytic efficiency since it does not require time-consuming and expensive cross-linking and immobilization approaches.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, enzymatic depolymerization of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) has emerged as an alternative technology
to conventional mechanical and chemical plastic recycling
approaches.
1
TfH from Thermobifida fusca (T. fusca) was the
first enzyme discovered in 2005 to possess PET degrading
activity.
2
Since then, many new PET hydrolases (PETases)
have been identified and engineered for higher PET
degradation efficiency.
3−5
Enzymatic PET hydrolysis produces
small-molecule degradation products, which can be recovered
and used to synthesize virgin polymers.
5,6
In addition to the
desired PET monomers terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG), bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and
mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (MHET) are also re-
leased as degradation intermediates that are known as
inhibitors for selected PETases.
7
Methods for mitigating the product inhibition during
enzymatic PET hydrolysis include the continuous removal of
small-molecule products using ultrafiltration membranes,
8
the
use of engineered PETase variants that are less affected by the
inhibitors,
9
and the introduction of a helper enzyme with a
specific hydrolytic activity on the inhibitors. Ideonella sakaiensis
(I. sakaiensis) is a bacterium that can degrade PET and
assimilate its monomers.
10
In addition to the extracellular I.
sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) which can depolymerize PET
predominantly to MHET, the intracellular MHETase has been
assumed to facilitate the PET assimilation by converting
MHET to TPA and EG.
10,11
This allowed for the development
of a chimeric MHETase:IsPETase fusion protein exhibiting
markedly improved PET depolymerization activity.
12
At 30 °C
and pH 7.5, this chimeric system produced approximately

sixfold more degradation products in 96 h than single IsPETase
in the PET hydrolysis. TfCa is a T. fusca carboxylesterase with
hydrolytic activity on PET oligomers, including MHET,
BHET, and a cyclic PET trimer.
13,14
When TfCa was
immobilized on a SulfoLink resin and then coupled with
various PETases such as LC-cutinase or TfCut2 for PET
degradation, the yield of degradation products was up to
twofold higher than when TfCa was absent.
15
Nevertheless,
both dual enzyme systems may be less feasible for industrial
applications due to the need of an efficient cross-linking
method or the high cost of the immobilization matrix.
Therefore, a low-cost dual enzyme system with enhanced
PET oligomer hydrolyzing activity is required.
While the crystal structures of MHETase have been recently
solved and repeatedly reported,
11,12,16
the structural basis
underlying the mechanism of TfCa-catalyzed hydrolysis of
TPA esters remains elusive. In this study, we elucidated the
first crystal structure of TfCa in its apo form and in complex
with the MHET-like analogue 4-[(2-hydroxyethyl) carbamoyl]
benzoic acid (MHETA) and BHET at atomic resolutions. By
comparing its specific activity on various TPA esters and an
ortho-phthalate ester (diethyl phthalate, DEP), the structural
basis for substrate recognition and hydrolysis by TfCa was
explored. Moreover, we rationally engineered TfCa and
obtained a mutant with significantly higher MHET and
BHET hydrolytic activity. This TfCa variant was applied in a
simple dual enzyme system in combination with an IsPETase
penta-mutant, IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A/N233C/S282C
(IsPETase
PM), for enhanced degradation of a variety of PET substrates
with different crystallinity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Materials. Chemicals and consumables were purchased
from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich
(Steinheim, Germany), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA, USA), and New England Biolabs GmbH (Frankfurt am
Main, Germany) unless stated otherwise. Primers were ordered
from Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany) and Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The amorphous PET film
(GfPET, ES30-FM-0001445) and the semi-crystalline PET
powder (maximum particle size: 300 μm, crystallinity >40%,
product number: ES306031/1) were purchased from Good-
fellow GmbH (Bad Nauheim, Germany). PET nanoparticles
(PET-NP) were prepared as described previously by Pfaff et
al.,
17
bis[2-(benzoyloxy)ethyl] terephthalate was defined as
3PET and synthesized according to Fischer-Colbrie et al.,
18
MHETA was synthesized as described by Palm et al.
11
Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determi-
nation, and Refinement. All crystallization experiments
were conducted at 25 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion
method. In general, 1 μL TfCa solution (40 mg/mL in 25 mM
Tris−HCl containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) was mixed with
1 μL reservoir solution in 48-well Cryschem Plates and
equilibrated against 100 μL of the reservoir solution. The
optimized crystallization conditions of TfCa and TfCa E319L
were 22% (w/v) poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt 5100, 0.02 M
MgCl
2
, 0.1 M HEPES at pH 7.5. The mutant TfCa E319L was
created to eliminate residue E319 of the catalytic triad to avoid
the hydrolysis of the substrate during the soaking period. A
detailed description of the enzyme expression for crystal-
lization purposes is included in the Supporting Information.
Within 5−6 days, the crystals reached their final size suitable
for X-ray diffraction. The TfCa and TfCa E319L crystals in
complex with MHETA, BHET, or MHET plus BHET were
obtained by soaking the enzyme with 10 mM of each
compound for 72 h.
All the X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at the
National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai at Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility at the beamlines BL10U2/
BL02U1(BL17U)/BL17B/BL18U1/BL19U1, and in Berlin at
the third-generation synchrotron radiation source (BESSY II)
with beamline 14.1.
19
The crystals were mounted in a cryoloop
and soaked with cryoprotectant solution [25% (w/v) poly-
(acrylic acid sodium salt) 5100, 0.02 M MgCl
2
, 0.1 M HEPES
pH 7.5, 10% glycerol] prior to data collection at 100 K. The
diffraction images were processed using HKL2000. The crystal
structure of TfCa was solved by the molecular replacement
method with the Phaser program
20
from the Phenix
21
suite
using the structure of the carboxylesterase from Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (PDB-ID: 2OGT) as a search model.
Further refinement was carried out using the programs
phenix.refine
22
and Coot.
23
Prior to structural refinement,
5% of randomly selected reflections were used for calculating
R
free
24
to monitor the refinement process. Data collection and
refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1.
Expression and Purification of Recombinant TfCa
and IsPETase PM. For enzymatic PET degradation, the TfCa
gene was cloned into a pET20b(+) vector and the plasmid was
transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Bacterial cells
were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 37 °C to an
optical density at 600 nm (OD
600
) of 1 and then further
incubated at 18 °C. When the OD
600
reached 1.5, recombinant
protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl β-
D-thiogalactopyranoside and cells were further grown at 18 °C
until an OD
600
of 3. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
10,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis
buffer containing 50 mM Na
2
HPO
4
(pH 8) and 150 mM
NaCl, followed by disruption by ultrasonication (3 × 90 s, 50%
pulse, 50% power, 2 min breaks). Cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was
then applied to a Ni
2+
-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed with
lysis buffer and a 20−90 mM imidazole gradient as described
before.
14
The enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 55
kDa was eluted with 250 mM imidazole, which was then
exchanged to the assay buffer (25 mM Tris−HCl, pH 7.5, set
at 45 °C) using Vivaspin (Sartorius Lab Instruments,
Go ̈ ttingen, Germany) with 10 kDa cutoff. The membrane of
the Vivaspin was equilibrated with 5 mL Tris−HCl buffer (25
mM, pH 7.5, set at 45 °C) by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000
× g. Afterward, the eluted protein was added to the Vivaspin,
topped with 5 mL Tris−HCl buffer, and centrifuged for 15 min
at 5000 × g and 4 °C. After repeating this four times, the
enzyme was removed from the upper compartment of the
Vivaspin column. The enzyme concentration was determined
using a NanoDrop 1000 device (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). IsPETase PM was expressed as described
by Brott et al.
25
and purified as described here for TfCa. The
model substrate para-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) was used for
determining the enzymatic activity as described before.
14
Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Mutation of the TfCa-
encoding gene was performed using the Q5 Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt am
Main, Germany) according to the supplier’s protocol.
Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing.
Enzymatic Production of the Substrate MHET. Similar
to terephthalic acid, commercially available MHET has a

benzoic acid end group and is hence almost insoluble in
aqueous solutions without organic solvents. Therefore, soluble
MHET with a deprotonated carboxylate end was prepared
from controlled enzymatic BHET degradation using TfCa as
described earlier.
7
Up to 100 mM BHET was added into
ethanol and sonicated in a water bath for 30 min until BHET
was dissolved to form a clear solution. The production of
MHET was carried out in a 50 mL reaction volume, containing
20 mM of BHET in ethanol, 550 nM of purified TfCa, and 25
mM Tris−HCl buffer (pH 7.5, set at 45 °C). The final
concentration of ethanol in the reaction was 10%. The solution
was incubated at room temperature for 30 min without
agitation. After incubation, the sample was heated to 80 °C for
10 min to inactivate TfCa and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5
min) to remove insoluble compounds. The supernatant was
analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) to ensure MHET purity and then used as a substrate
for further enzyme characterization.
Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Various Substrates. Enzy-
matic hydrolysis of the small ester substrates 3PET, BHET,
MHET, and DEP was performed in 1 mL reaction volume
using 25 mM Tris−HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at 50 °C with 550 nM
purified enzyme unless stated otherwise. In total, 2 mM 3PET,
BHET, or MHET, or 5 mM DEP were used in the reactions.
For an enhanced solubility of the substrates, the hydrolysis of
3PET, BHET, and MHET was performed in the presence of
10% ethanol and that of DEP hydrolysis in 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide. Sampling at different time points during hydrolysis
reactions was performed as indicated below in the Results
section. The degradation products benzoic acid (BA), BHET,
MHET, and TPA were confirmed by HPLC, whereas
monoethyl phthalate (MEP) was confirmed by liquid
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC−MS).
A detailed description of the LC−MS method is included in
the Supporting Information.
In a dual enzyme system, PET-NP, PET powder, or PET
film were employed as substrates. PET-NP were used at a final
concentration of 2, 20, and 200 μg/mL, whereas PET powder
and PET film were used at a final concentration of 60 mg/mL
in Tris−HCl buffer (set to pH 7.5 at 45 °C). Purified IsPETase
PM was used at a concentration of 30 nM for PET-NP and 50
nM for PET film and PET powder as described before.
25
The
amounts of the aromatic products were determined using
HPLC according to Palm et al.
11
The amount of TPA, MHET,
or BHET was calculated based on a TPA standard curve and
the amount of MEP was calculated based on a phthalic acid
(PA) standard curve. The specific activity was calculated as U/
mg
enzyme
, while one unit (U) was defined as one μmol substrate
converted per min.
Determination of Melting Points. The melting points
(T
m
) of TfCa and its mutants were determined using nano
differential scanning fluorimetry on a Prometheus NT.48
device (NanoTemper Technologies, Munich, Germany).
Purified enzymes at a concentration of 300 μg/mL were
used to monitor the thermal denaturation profiles from 40 to
80 °C at 1 °C/min steps. T
m
was calculated based on the
excitation changes at 285 nm with emission wavelengths at 330
and 350 nm.
Molecular Docking. Molecular docking of 3PET, DEP,
and MEP into the active site of TfCa was performed with an
AutoDock Vina v1.2.0 and Dockprep as part of Chimera
v1.15.
26
The docking for 3PET was performed in a box with an
edge length of 50 Å around S185, the docking for DEP and
MEP was performed in a box with an edge length of 25 Å for
DEP and MEP around residue A108, which includes the active
site and its surroundings. The AutoDock Vina score was set to
−9.9, −6.2, and −6.0 for 3PET, DEP, or MEP, respectively.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The crystal structures
of TfCa with the ligand MHETA (PDB-ID: 7W1J, 1.92 Å) as
well as the chain A structure of MHETase from I. sakaiensis
(PDB-ID: 6QGA, 2.1 Å)
11,27
were used for molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. In total, three independent MD
replicates with 20 ns long production simulation were run for
each system at 310 K (37 °C) using the Langevin thermostat at
a constant pressure of 1.0 bar and a pressure coupling constant
of 1.0 ps. Coordinates were saved at intervals of 4 ps. In total,
60 ns of simulation time was produced for each enzyme−
ligand system.
Each complex was clustered into three trajectories and the
molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/
GBSA)
28,29
method was applied to calculate the binding free
energy (ΔG

) of MHET in the enzymes and the respective
residue-by-residue interactions.

RESULTS
Structure of TfCa in Its Apo Form. The ligand-free wild-
type TfCa (TfCa wt) was crystallized in the monoclinic space
group P2
1
(PDB-ID: 7W1K, 1.40 Å). The enzyme is built from
three domains, a hydrolase domain that adopts the fold of a
canonical α/β hydrolase with a central antiparallel β-sheet
surrounded by α-helices, a lid domain A and a lid domain B
(Figure 1A). As predicted from sequence alignment with
homologous enzymes that exhibit carboxylesterase activity,
TfCa contains a strictly conserved catalytic triad consisting of
the residues S185, E319, and H415. Hence, a p-nitrobenzyl
esterase (pNB-E) from Bacillus subtilis (PDB-ID: 1QE3) and
the carboxylesterase Est55 from G. stearothermophilus (PDB-
ID: 2OGS) were used as templates for elucidating the
backbone structure of TfCa. Within the catalytic triad of
TfCa, S185 serves as the nucleophile and is located within
hydrogen-bond (H-bond) distance to be polarized by the base
H415, which is stabilized by the acid E319. A sequence
alignment, as well as structural alignments of pNB-E, Est55,
and TfCa, are shown in Figures S1 and S2.
Binding Modes to PET-Related Ligands. To explore the
catalytic mechanism of TfCa, protein crystals were soaked with
the substrates MHET and BHET as well as with the substrate
analogue MHETA. MHETA has an amide bond in place of the
ester bond in MHET and can hence not be hydrolyzed by
esterolytic enzymes including TfCa. With TfCa wt, a ligand-
bound structure of TfCa with MHETA (PDB-ID: 7W1J, 1.92
Å) was solved. By mutating E319 in the catalytic triad, an
inactive TfCa variant E319L was generated. This variant
allowed for stable substrate binding and two additional
complex structures with BHET (PDB-ID: 7W1L, 2.43 Å)
and with both degradation intermediates, MHET and BHET
(PDB-ID: 7W1I, 1.67 Å). In the ligand-bound structures of
TfCa, the ligands were located at the bottom of a deep active
site cleft containing the hydrophobic residues L282, L322, and
V376. The side chain of the catalytic S185 is within H-bonding
distance to the ester oxygen atom of BHET (PDB-ID: 7W1I,
Figure 1E) and the nitrogen atom of MHETA (PDB-ID:
7W1J, Figure 1B).

The overall structures of TfCa and MHETase and their
binding modes to the ligand MHETA are compared as shown
in Figure 1A−D. While MHETase consists of one hydrolase
domain and one lid domain, the overall structure of TfCa can
be divided into one hydrolase domain and two lid domains
(Lid A and Lid B). In the active site of TfCa, only three H-
bonds are formed, preliminarily with the amide bond and the
neighboring hydroxyl end in MHETA (Figure 1B). By
comparison, five H-bonds are present in MHETase to interact
with both ends of the MHETA ligand (Figure 1D). Side chains
of selected phenylalanine residues (F323 and F377 for TfCa,
F495 and F415 for MHETase) were found to be potentially
involved in stabilizing the TPA moiety in MHETA. In
MHETase, F415 and F495 are located on both sides of the
benzoic ring of the soaked MHETA ligand. In contrast, F323
and F377 in TfCa are exclusively positioned on one side of
MHETA. This binding mode may only permit a staggered
stacking interaction of F323 and a very weak T-shaped
interaction of the more distant F377 from the same direction
to the TPA moiety (Figure 1B). Similar interactions between
these two aromatic residues and the BHET ligand (Figure 1E)
suggest that F377 plays a minor role in the substrate
stabilization.
We also investigated the binding of MHET to TfCa and
MHETase using MD simulations. As shown in Table S5, by
clustering the snapshots during the 60 ns productive
simulations, MHET has a significantly higher likelihood of
staying in the substrate binding pocket of MHETase than in
that of TfCa. For clustering the snapshots, the distance
between the MHET ester carbonyl atom and the side chain
oxygen of the catalytic serine in each enzyme is defined as the
catalytic C−O distance. Those snapshots with a catalytic C−O
distance less than 4.5 Å were selected to calculate the binding
free energy of MHET to individual residues in the substrate
binding pocket of each enzyme using MM/GBSA.
29
In
MHETase we found that, in addition to the aforementioned
F415 and F495, R411 and W397 considerably contribute to
the interaction with MHET (Table S3 and Figure S10B). By
contrast, in TfCa, certain small residues such as G106, G107,
and A108 appear to play an important role in the binding to
MHET, in addition to the amino acids neighboring S185 and
the aromatic residues F323 and F377 discovered in the crystal
structures (Figures 1B,E and S10A). In accordance with the
crystal structure analysis, MD simulation results support the
conclusion that MHETase has a higher overall binding affinity
to MHET than TfCa.
Substrate Profile of TfCa. The substrate profile of TfCa
was investigated with TPA-based oligo-esters of various
lengths, such as MHET, BHET, and 3PET, as well as the
ortho-phthalate ester DEP. HPLC-derived product profile
allowed us to hypothesize the degradation pathways of longer
substrates and estimate the specific activity of TfCa in
hydrolyzing various esters at each reaction step (Figure 2).
MHET is the monoester of TPA and EG and also the
smallest among all the investigated substrates. The specific
activity of MHET hydrolysis by TfCa was 0.024 U/mg
enzyme
as
shown in Figure 2A. BHET is the diester of one TPA with two
EG. The first hydrolysis of BHET will form MHET and EG,
while the second hydrolysis step yields TPA and EG (Figure
2B). The specific activity of TfCa for the first BHET hydrolysis
step was found to be much higher (5.12 U/mg
enzyme
) than that
of the second hydrolysis step (0.011 U/mg
enzyme
) (Figure
2A,B). Although the second hydrolysis step of BHET is
equivalent to the MHET hydrolysis, it revealed an approx-
imately two times lower specific activity than the primary
MHET hydrolysis. This can be attributed to a less-preferred
binding of MHET in the presence of the competitive substrate
BHET, which can be hydrolyzed nearly 500 times faster by
TfCa.
Similar to BHET, DEP is a diester of ortho-phthalate and
ethanol (Figure 2D). After 1 h of incubation at 50 °C, DEP
was not detectable as a result of TfCa-catalyzed hydrolysis.
LC−MS analysis suggested that DEP was completely
converted to MEP (Figure S11), which can also be monitored
as a new peak at a retention time of 11.25 min on HPLC. The
specific activity of this primary hydrolysis step is 1.64 U/
mg
enzyme
, which is 3 times lower than BHET hydrolysis but 82
times higher than MHET hydrolysis. MEP was not further

hydrolyzed to PA, suggesting that it is a less-preferred substrate
for TfCa than MHET.
3PET is the longest oligomer investigated in this study with
four ester bonds. TfCa-catalyzed hydrolysis of 3PET can yield
different product profiles depending on where the first
hydrolysis step occurs (Figures S9 and 2E). After 10 min
hydrolysis reaction with TfCa at 50 °C, 2-hydroxyethyl-
benzoate (HEB) was detected as one product, of which the
amount decreases with the reaction duration. Consequently,
we suggest a preferential degradation pathway of 3PET, which
releases HEB as an intermediate product from 3PET by TfCa.
This degradation pattern is similar to that described by Eberl et
al.
31
for 3PET hydrolysis catalyzed by a T. fusca cutinase.
However, the other product from the first hydrolysis step, 4-
{[2-(benzoyloxy)ethoxy]-carbonyl} benzoic acid (BECBA)
cannot be detected by HPLC. Based on the rate of HEB
formation, we determined a specific activity of 0.06 U/mg
enzyme
for the first hydrolysis step of 3PET. This is three times higher
than for MHET but 85 times and 27 times lower than for
BHET and DEP, respectively. The lower specific activity for
3PET is probably due to the size of the substrate. The high
specific activity observed for BHET and DEP suggests that
(tere)phthalate diesters may have the ideal size for the
substrate binding pocket of TfCa. In the second hydrolysis step
of 3PET, both HEB and BECBA are further hydrolyzed. This
can be verified by the decreasing concentration of HEB and the
increasing amounts of BA and MHET in the samples at the
later reaction stage. The estimated specific activity of this
reaction step is lower than the first step hydrolysis of 3PET but
slightly higher than MHET (Figure 2A). HEB is a monoester
comparable to MHET, whereas BECBA is a diester with two
aromatic moieties. The markedly lower specific activity
observed for BECBA compared to BHET suggests that the
additional aromatic ring may hinder the TfCa hydrolysis
efficiency. This is consistent with a previous study demonstrat-
ing that TfCa can hydrolyze BHET faster than 1,2-ethanediyl
bis(4-methylbenzoate).
32
Similar to BECBA, the latter model
substrate is a diester with two aromatic moieties and is also
commonly used to resemble PET repeating units. The final
reaction step of 3PET hydrolysis is MHET hydrolysis, which
releases TPA and EG. After a 6 h reaction, MHET was the
major product measured by HPLC, followed by BA and TPA
(Figure S6).
A previous study has shown that MHETase possesses an
exo-PETase activity allowing for the hydrolysis of the terminal
ester groups of PET polymers.
16
Accordingly, we tested TfCa
for its capacity to hydrolyze PET end groups but were unable
to demonstrate its exo-PETase activity (Figures 2A and S7).

Structure-Based Enzyme Engineering of TfCa. To
improve the activity of TfCa on MHET and BHET, amino acid
residues within 5 Å of the soaked ligands (Figures 1B,E and
S3) were selected for rational engineering. Among the 29
amino acids identified, all alanine, glycine, and proline residues,
and those in the catalytic triad as well as the conserved GxSxG
motif were excluded from mutagenesis. The remaining 14
residues were individually substituted with alanine (alanine
scan). The resulting mutants were first evaluated for BHET
hydrolysis activity (Figure S4). Two variants, R428A and
V376A, showed ≥1.2-fold higher activity than TfCa wt and
were thus selected for further investigations (Figures 3A and
S4). R428 and V376 have rather bulky side-chains, which are
assumed to affect the substrate binding. As a result, an alanine
substitution may possibly provide additional space to
accommodate larger substrates like BHET. By contrast, the
I69A and M189A variants were completely inactive. These two
residues were then subjected to site saturation mutagenesis.
The variant I69W was found to be more than twofold more
active than that of TfCa wt (Figure 3A), whereas none of the
M189 site-saturated mutants was significantly more active with
the model substrate pNPA (Figure S5). Based on the complex
structures shown in Figures 1 and S3, we hypothesize that the
mutation I69W, similar to the residues F323 and F377, may
facilitate to interact with the aromatic moiety in the substrate.
All three variants with significantly increased activity,
namely, TfCa
R428A
, TfCa
V376A
, and TfCa
I69W
, were combined
in all possible variations (Figure 3A). The highest activity was
achieved with the mutant TfCa
I69W/V376A
, which had a 3.3-fold
higher activity on BHET than TfCa wt at 45 °C and is
designated as TfCa WA in the following descriptions.
We further investigated the thermostability of TfCa wt and
WA. Although TfCa WA has a lower T
m
(60.3 °C) than TfCa
wt (64.5 °C) (Table S2), its relative residual activities after 1 h
incubation at 45, 50, and 55 °C were comparable to those of
TfCa wt (Figure 3B). In contrast, TfCa WA became inactive
after 1 h at 60 °C whereas TfCa wt had still 40% of its initial
activity. Based on these results, we determined the temperature
profile of both enzymes for BHET hydrolysis in the
temperature range of 45−55 °C (Figure 3C). Although a
substrate conversion at a similar level of approximately 80%
was obtained with both enzymes after a 6 h reaction at 45 and
50 °C, an overall lower BHET conversion of nearly 60% was
determined at 55 °C (Figure 3C). At reaction temperatures up
to 50 °C, TfCa WA-catalyzed BHET hydrolysis yielded higher
amounts of TPA than TfCa wt. Because the biocatalytic
conversion of BHET to TPA requires two ester bond
cleavages, this suggested a superior hydrolytic activity of
TfCa WA over TfCa wt at up to 50 °C. Although TfCa wt
showed a marginally higher yield of TPA from BHET
hydrolysis at 55 °C, the considerably lower total substrate

substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 7 mM. Reaction supernatants were taken after 30 min of incubation at 50 °C in 25 mM Tris-buffer
(pH 7.5, set at 50 °C) and subjected to HPLC analysis. Error bars indicate the standard deviations calculated from at least three replicates.

conversion levels with both enzymes exclude this temperature
as the ideal reaction condition. Thus, 50 °C appeared to be the
optimal temperature for BHET hydrolysis by both enzymes.
Next, we performed the enzymatic hydrolysis of MHET at 50
°C. At the same substrate concentration of 2 mM, more than
twofold TPA was released from MHET compared to BHET
with both enzymes. TfCa WA yielded 3.3-fold and 2.6-fold
more TPA from the hydrolysis of BHET and MHET than
TfCa wt, respectively.
Finally, we compared the rates of TPA release as a result of
the enzymatic hydrolysis of MHET at various concentrations
ranging from 0.5 to 7 mM (Figure 3D). In agreement with the
other experiments described here, TfCa WA hydrolyzed
MHET at least three times faster than TfCa wt. The superior
activity of TfCa WA is more pronounced at higher substrate
concentrations up to 7 mM.
Degradation of PET Polymers Using a Dual Enzyme
System. We further used free TfCa in a dual enzyme system
in combination with a recently published variant of IsPETase
PM to degrade PET.
25
Based on its temperature profile
determined previously,
25
the degradation reaction was
performed at 45 °C. At this condition, neither TfCa wt nor
TfCa WA can solely degrade PET-NP to release detectable
aromatic products (data not shown). First, varying amounts of
PET-NP (2, 20, and 200 μg/mL) were degraded using the dual
enzyme system consisting of TfCa and IsPETase PM (Figure
4A). When only IsPETase PM was present, the main soluble
product was MHET independent of the substrate amount
used. By adding TfCa wt or its WA variant, TPA was the only
detectable product released from PET-NP. With 2 μg/mL of
PET-NP, slightly decreased overall product yields were
obtained when TfCa enzymes are present. At higher substrate
concentrations, the overall product yield was up to 1.6-fold
higher with the TfCa WA based dual enzyme system than with
TfCa wt. The latter enzyme appeared to only convert the
MHET and BHET intermediates to TPA but did not further
boost the polymer degradation extent.
Next, we used the dual enzyme system to degrade the high-
crystalline GfPET powder and the amorphous GfPET film
(Figure 4B). These materials are less degradable for PETases
than PET-NP because of higher crystallinity and lower relative
surface area.
33
Therefore, we used higher substrate and enzyme
concentrations to simplify the detection of degradation
products. As shown in Figure 4B, the addition of TPA-ester
hydrolyzing enzymes has resulted in a markedly increased
overall yield of aromatic products with both GfPET film and
GfPET powder. When GfPET film was used as the substrate,
the overall yield is 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in the
presence of TfCa WA and TfCa wt compared to the reaction
with solely IsPETase PM. Accordingly, the overall product
yield improvements with GfPET powder were 4.7- and 5.2-fold
with TfCa wt and TfCa WA, respectively. Additionally, as
already observed in reactions with PET-NP, the addition of
TfCa enzymes eliminated almost completely the MHET
fraction in the degradation products. Overall, the TPA yield
was increased by 8.3-fold with PET-NP, 14-fold with PET
powder, and 11-fold with GfPET film as substrates using the
dual enzyme system with TfCa WA as a helper enzyme for
IsPETase PM.

with 0.55 μM TfCa wt, and WA with 0.55 μM TfCa WA. The experiments were performed in 25 mM Tris−HCl buffer (pH 7.5, set at 45 °C). (A)
Varying amounts of PET-NP (left: 2 μg/mL, middle: 20 μg/mL, and right: 200 μg/mL) were degraded using 30 nM of IsPETase PM and 0.55 μM
of the indicated TfCa variant. The concentration of aromatic products was determined after 24 h of incubation at 45 °C. Aromatic products
detected by HPLC include BHET, MHET, and TPA. (B) Depicted is the same set-up as shown in (A) with high-crystallinity GfPET powder (60
mg/mL) and amorphous PET film (60 mg/mL) as substrates in the presence of 50 nM IsPETase PM and 0.55 μM of the indicated TfCa variant.
Error bars indicate the standard deviations calculated from at least three replicates.

DISCUSSION
In this work, we elucidated the apo form as well as ligand-
soaked structures of the carboxylesterase TfCa and charac-
terized its enzymatic activity on (tere)phthalate-based oligo-
esters of various lengths. We found that BHET, an aromatic
para-diester, is the most easily hydrolyzable substrate for TfCa.
When the diesters are ortho-positioned, like in DEP, or with
two aromatic moieties (BECBA), the specific activity becomes
lower but is still higher than the hydrolysis of MHET and other
monoesters (Figure 2). The aromatic monoester MEP has an
ortho-positioned carboxylic acid end group, and it cannot be
further hydrolyzed to PA by TfCa. Molecular docking of DEP
into the apo form of TfCa suggests that when MEP reenters
the active site, it cannot be further hydrolyzed due to its
unproductive positioning in the substrate-binding pocket
(Figure 5A,B). For the substrate 3PET, we suggest a
degradation pathway based on the analysis of the hydrolysis
products. The first hydrolysis step of 3PET forms HEB and
BECBA, which is confirmed by docking results shown in
Figure 5C. The positioning of the oligo-ester in the substrate-
binding pocket of TfCa suggests a preferential hydrolysis of the
second ester bond (Figure 2) in 3PET, releasing the products
HEB and BECBA. While HEB should leave the binding site
earlier in the hydrolysis event, BECBA could presumably bind
the same enzyme molecule more easily, allowing it to undergo
pseudo-processive hydrolysis to release MHET and BA. This
hypothesis is supported by the change of the product profile
determined by HPLC during the TfCa-catalyzed hydrolysis of
3PET (Figure S6).
We engineered TfCa toward higher oligo-ester hydrolyzing
activity based on crystal structures of TfCa with different
ligands. The mutant TfCa WA possesses a 3.3-fold higher
activity in converting BHET to TPA compared to TfCa wt.
We used the variant TfCa WA in a dual enzyme system to
depolymerize PET together with a recently published variant
of IsPETase.
25
The addition of the carboxylesterase increased
the TPA yield in the reaction by up to 14-fold. Similar to
MHETase from I. sakaiensis, TfCa alone is not active on PET
but can promote the conversion of MHET, which is the major
product of enzymatic PET depolymerization by many PET
hydrolases,
34
in a dual enzyme system with IsPETase PM. This
conversion will not only help to offset the inhibitory effect of
MHET on PET hydrolases, but it will furthermore aid in the
recovery of extremely pure TPA, which can be directly used for
the polymer synthesis.
4,5
In the presence of immobilized TfCa,
an increased yield of TPA from PET film has been reported
with a dual enzyme system containing the PET hydrolases LC-
cutinase or TfCut2.
15
The authors immobilized TfCa using a
SulfoLink matrix. This dual enzyme system resulted in an
increased overall product yield by 91% for TfCut2 and 104%
for LC-cutinase. Using another dual enzyme system containing
chimeric I. sakaiensis PETase and MHETase, Knott et al.
degraded the amorphous PET film (2−3% crystallinity,
Goodfellow, UK) at 30 °C for 96 h using 0.25 mg PETase
and 0.5 mg MHETase per gram PET.
12
IsPETase alone
produced approximately 0.2 mM TPA at this condition,
whereas the addition of free MHETase resulted in a twofold
higher TPA yield. The chimeric proteins of MHETase and
IsPETase constructed in the same study showed further
increased activity by up to seven fold in comparison to the dual
free enzyme system.
12
In this study, we used a recently
published variant of IsPETase
25
in combination with TfCa wt
and WA. Compared to the results reported by Knott et al., we
yielded the same amount of TPA from the same substrate
(GfPET amorphous film) using 10% IsPETase (0.024 mg/
g
PET
) within one-fourth of the reaction time (24 h) at 45 °C.
In general, carboxylesterases such as TfCa are known to
exhibit similar functions and contain highly conserved regions.
We constructed a phylogenetic tree showing the relationship
between the different homologous sequences to TfCa (Figure
S8). Some of the strains we found in the phylogenetic tree, for
example, Thermobifida alba, Thermobifida halotolerans, and
Actinomadura hallensis, contain enzymes known to potentially
catalyze the PET polymer degradation.
35−37
Furthermore, the
strains Actinomadura rubrobrunea, Actinomadura nitritigenes,
and Thermobifida cellulosilytica were mentioned in a
phylogenetic study on the characterization and isolation of
polyester degrading bacteria.
38
These findings lead to the
question of whether polyester depolymerases and oligomer
hydrolases co-exist in bacteria. Since both the PETase and the
MHETase were found in I. sakaiensis, the emergence of natural
dual enzyme systems appears to be a logical conclusion.
Additionally, I. sakaiensis was found to metabolize TPA and
possess a specific TPA translocation system.
39
However, the
lack of a specific transporter machinery for MHET in I.
sakaiensis invalidates the assumption that the extracellular
PETase and intracellular MHETase can work synergistically
during the bacterial assimilation of PET. Similarly, TfCa and
TfCut2, the artificially synergistic enzymes in PET depolyme-
rization, are derived from the same species of T. fusca.
15
Unlike
I. sakaiensis, the genome of T. fusca
40
does not encode any
potential TPA metabolic pathway. Kleeberg et al. have grown a
T. fusca strain on mineral salt agar using a TPA-containing
aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester as the sole carbon source.

structure. (A) Positioning of DEP in the active site of TfCa according
to docking experiments. The ester closest to S185 will be cleaved,
allowing EG and MEP to leave the active site. (B) The most favorable
docking pose of MEP in the active site of TfCa is analogous to that
after the hydrolysis event of DEP. In this manner, the ester bond in
MEP cannot be hydrolyzed by the enzyme. (C) Positioning of 3PET,
the largest substrate investigated, in the active site of TfCa supports
the suggested degradation pathway. Residues from different domains
are shown in brown (TfCa

Although the polyesters depolymerized rapidly during the
culturing process, only poor bacterial growth was observed.
This is in line with the aforementioned genome analysis, which
suggests T. fusca cannot effectively metabolize PET degrada-
tion products, including MHET. As T. fusca is extremely
unlikely to be able to translocate MHET into the cytosol,
similar to I. sakaiensis, the role of TfCa in PET depolymeriza-
tion in the natural environment remains elusive.
The ability of TfCa to degrade the ortho-phthalate ester
DEP broadens its substrate specificity. DEP is not only an
ortho-phthalate ester but also one of the widely used
plasticizers, which are produced annually on a million-ton
scale. Plasticizers are added to various polymer materials to
alter their properties for easier raw material handling or to
meet the application demands required for the end products.
42
However, phthalate-ester-based plasticizers like DEP are
known to have endocrine-disrupting, carcinogenic, teratogenic,
and mutagenic effects on humans and wildlife.
43
As a result, an
efficient decontamination of phthalic esters is a global concern.
PA can be assimilated by various microbes and used as a
carbon source.
44−46
PA-ring opening enzymes, such as
dioxygenases and carboxylesterases, are needed by the PA
assimilating species like Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, or
Arthrobacter and others. Nonetheless, our phylogenetic analysis
(Figure S8) indicates that these strains are unlikely to express
TfCa homologous enzymes. Although the promiscuous
hydrolytic activity of TfCa on aromatic oligo-esters in nature
is still unknown, the recombinant form of this enzyme has the
potential to find ideal application scenarios in the area of
environmental biocatalysis and remediation.
In conclusion, the apo and complex crystal structures of
TfCa solved in this study shed light on the mechanistic aspects
of this enzyme in the hydrolysis of aromatic oligo-esters. These
findings allow us to rationally engineer TfCa and apply its most
active WA variant in a simple dual enzyme system to relieve
product inhibition during enzymatic PET depolymerization. In
comparison to previous efforts that employed cross-linked
MHETase and IsPETase or immobilized TfCa, our simplified
dual enzyme system provides a more efficient and less costly
solution, which may hold greater promise for industrial-scale
applications.
