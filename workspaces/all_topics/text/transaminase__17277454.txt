The enzyme !-transaminase catalyses the conversion of chiral !-amines to
ketones. The recombinant enzyme fromChromobacterium violaceumhas been
puriﬁed to homogeneity. The enzyme was crystallized from PEG 4000 using the
microbatch method. Data were collected to 1.7 A˚ resolution from a crystal
belonging to the triclinic space groupP1, with unit-cell parametersa = 58.9,
b = 61.9, c = 63.9 A˚, /C11 = 71.9, /C12 = 87.0, /C13 = 74.6
/C14 . Data were also collected to
1.95 A˚ from a second triclinic crystal form. The structure has been solved using
the molecular-replacement method.
1. Introduction
The transaminases (aminotransferases; EC 2.6.1) are a large group of
enzymes that catalyse the reversible transfer of an amino group from
amino acids to oxo acids (Mehtaet al., 1993). All transaminases use
the cofactor pyridoxal 5
0-phosphate (PLP; vitamin B6) for catalysis.
They are ubiquitously present in microorganisms and in higher
organisms and play an important role in amino-acid metabolism
(Christen & Metzler, 1985).
The mechanism by which transaminase enzymes act consists of two
half-reactions in which the cofactor alternates between two forms: the
aldehyde (PLP) and amino (PMP) forms. An amino acid (amino
donor) donates its amine group to the PLP form of the enzyme
(E-PLP) to produce enzyme-pyridoxamine-5
0-phosphate (E-PMP)
and the corresponding keto acid. In the second half-reaction, the
amino acceptor accepts the amino group from E-PMP to produce the
corresponding amino acid and regenerates E-PLP (Shin & Kim, 2002;
Eliot & Kirsch, 2004).
Transaminases can be divided into four subgroups based on their
amino-acid sequence relationship (Mehtaet al., 1993). Subgroup II
contains ornithine (EC 2.6.1.13), 4-aminobutyrate (EC 2.6.1.19),
acetylornithine (EC.2.6.1.11), diaminopelargonate (EC.2.6.1.62) and
!-amino acid:pyruvate transaminases (EC 2.6.1.18). Within this
subgroup, the distal amino group of the substrate undergoes trans-
amination. These transaminases can therefore be regarded collec-
tively as !-transaminases. Among these !-transaminases, only
!-amino acid:pyruvate transaminase shows catalytic activity towards
primary amines and aliphatic amines without a carboxyl group
(Yonaha et al., 1987; Shin & Kim, 1999; Shinet al., 2003).
The major interest in bacterial!-transaminases is their industrial
importance, as they can be used as biocatalysts for the asymmetric
synthesis of homochiral amines of high enantioselective purity (Shin
& Kim, 1999; Choet al., 2003; Yunet al., 2003). The!-transaminases
from Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17, Klebsiella pneumoniae JS2F andBacillus
thuringiensis JS64 show high enantioselectivity for certain enantio-
mers of chiral amines such as (S)-/C11-methylbenzylamine (Shin & Kim,
1998; Shin & Kim, 2001). The!-amino acid:pyruvate transaminase
from Chromobacterium violaceum has a molecular weight of
51 213 Da. It shows 38% sequence similarity to the!-transaminase
from V. ﬂuvialisJS17. During the!-transaminase reaction, the amino
donor, for example methylbenzylamine, is converted to the ketone
acetophenone and the amino acceptor pyruvate, which is converted
to the /C11-amino acid alanine (Hwang & Kim, 2004). Their relaxed
substrate speciﬁcity, rapid reaction rates and no requirement for

external cofactor regeneration makes transaminase enzymes attrac-
tive biocatalysts compared with chemical methods for the production
of chiral amines (Tayloret al., 1998).
Several structures of subgroup II transaminases have been deter-
mined to date. The most closely related structure toC. violaceum!-
transaminase is that of diaminopelargonic acid synthase (PDB code
1qj3; Kack et al., 1999), which shares 26% amino-acid sequence
identity. The transaminases of known three-dimensional structure
that have higher than 20% sequence identity toC. violaceum !-
transaminase are all dimeric molecules.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein purification
The gene coding for the!-amino acid:pyruvate transaminase was
cloned into the expression vector pET29a (Novagen) incorporating a
N-terminal six-His tag and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS (Kaulmannet al., 2007). E. coli BL21 Star
(pLysS) cells harbouring the pET29a vector containing the trans-
aminase gene were grown on Luria–Bertani medium at 310 K to an
optical density at 600 nm of 0.8 and were induced with 1 mM
isopropyl /C12-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h.
The harvestedE. colicells containing the expressed protein were
resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 (bufferA) and sonicated for
ten 15 s cycles. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifu-
gation at 12 000g for 20 min at 277 K.
The soluble fraction was applied onto a 30 ml nickel-afﬁnity
chromatography column (Nickel Sepharose Hi-Performance, GE
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with bufferA. A linear gradient was
used over ﬁve column volumes leading to 100% bufferB (50 mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1M imidazole) at a ﬂow rate of 3 ml min
/C0 1 and was
collected in 5 ml fractions. Active fractions were pooled and the
protein was precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, centrifuged at
12 000g for 20 min and redissolved in bufferC (50 mM Tris–HCl pH
7.5, 100 mM NaCl). The protein was applied onto a 120 ml gel-
ﬁltration column (Superdex 200 Hiload 16/60, GE Healthcare) pre-
equilibrated with bufferC at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min/C0 1 and collected
in 1 ml fractions. All puriﬁcation steps were carried out at 277 K. The
purity of the protein was analysed by SDS–PAGE (Laemmli, 1970)
and the concentration of the protein was estimated using the absor-
bance at A
280; the extinction coefﬁcient was calculated to be
80 245M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 from the protein sequence using the ExPASY
database (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000).
2.2. Crystallization
Crystallization was carried out by the microbatch method using an
Oryx 8 automated robot (Douglas Instruments) at 290 K. Prior to
concentration, 100mM PLP was added to the protein solution. The
protein was concentrated using a 30 kDa molecular-weight cutoff
Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator (Sartorius, UK) to 10 mg ml
/C0 1 in
50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. Initial crystallization screens
were performed using Molecular Dimensions Structure Screens 1 and
2. 1ml protein solution was added to 1ml crystallization buffer, giving
a ﬁnal protein concentration of 5 mg ml/C0 1. The droplets were covered
with a 50:50(v:v) mix of silicon and parafﬁn oil.
Two potential crystallization conditions were found: 0.05 M
HEPES pH 7.5, 5%(v/v) 2-propanol, 10%(w/v) PEG 4000 (condition
1) and 0.1M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.05M Tris–HCl pH 8.5,
15%(w/v) PEG 4000 (condition 2). However, for both conditions
both the droplet and crystals appeared to be colourless. Crystal-
lization was optimized for the second of these conditions over a range
of concentrations of protein, lithium sulfate, Tris–HCl and PEG 4000.
Further optimizations were carried out with the addition of PLP to
the crystallization droplet to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 100mM.
Crystals grown under these conditions were of a yellow colour.
Crystallization condition 1 was not pursued at this stage because of
the quality of the crystals obtained using condition 2, which were of
better quality and size.
2.3. Crystallographic data collection
Data were collected in-house using a rotating-anode generator
(Bruker AXS) operated at 100 mA and 35 kV (3.5 kW) producing
Cu K/C11 radiation. No cryogenic liquor was used and the crystals were
transferred directly from the crystal drop into liquid nitrogen. Data
were collected under cryocooling conditions (in a 100 K nitrogen-gas
stream) using a MAR Research 345 image plate. The rotation
increment for data collection was 0.5
/C14 per frame. Data were collected
from two crystals. Data from the ﬁrst crystal (colourless in appear-
ance, grown without addition of PLP to the crystal droplet) were
collected over 620
/C14 . The blind region was minimized by bending the
loop after 360/C14 of data collection. Data from a second crystal (yellow
in colour, grown with PLP added to the crystal droplet) were
collected over 245
/C14 . The data were processed using the programs
DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The data
sets were processed without specifying any resolution ranges corre-
sponding to ice rings to be rejected; a signiﬁcant number of reﬂections
in these resolution ranges were rejected as having poor background.
3. Results and discussion
The puriﬁed recombinant!-transaminase migrated on SDS–PAGE
as a single band of approximately 50 kDa. However, gel-ﬁltration
analysis carried out in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.1M NaCl estimated
the protein to have a weight of approximately 100 kDa, suggesting
that the enzyme exists as a homodimer.
Crystals of form A were grown in 0.1M lithium sulfate, 0.05M
Tris–HCl pH 8.5, 15%(w/v) PEG 4000 in the absence of the addition
of any PLP to the crystal droplet and grew to dimensions of 0.5/C2 0.4
/C2 0.2 mm (Fig. 1). A crystal of this form diffracted to 1.67 A˚ in-house
and belonged to the triclinic space groupP1, with unit-cell para-
meters a = 58.9,b = 61.9,c = 63.9 A˚, /C11 = 71.9,/C12 = 86.9,/C13 = 74.6

contains a transaminase dimer, which gives a solvent content of

transaminase dimers in the asymmetric unit that are related by
pseudotranslation. The native Patterson synthesis calculated between
15 and 4 A˚ resolution shows a signiﬁcant peak at (0.0, 0.5, 0.5) which
is 14.1/C27 or 14% of the origin peak in height. The solvent content of

triclinic unit cell appears to be comprised of two unit cells of crystal
form A. It would appear that this doubling of the unit-cell volume is
caused by the presence of PLP in the crystallization solution as the
crystal of form B was yellow while the crystals of form A were
colourless.
A range of mother liquors and cryoprotectants were tested using
various mixtures of PEG 400, PEG 4000 and glycerol. A signiﬁcant
deterioration in crystal diffraction, with both reduced resolution and
increased mosaicity, was observed for all cryoprotectants tested. As
no suitable cryogenic liquor was found, the data sets were collected
and were processed with ice rings. This resulted in some reﬂections in
the corresponding resolution shells being lost during data processing.
Freezing the crystal under silicon oil is being attempted in order to
improve the ice-ring problem. A summary of the X-ray data statistics
is shown in Table 1 for both crystal forms.
Molecular-replacement studies were carried out with the program
MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 1997) using chainA of 7,8-diamino-
pelargonic acid synthase as a model (PDB code 1qj3; Kacket al.,
1999), which has 26% amino-acid sequence identity to the!-amino-
transferase. The resulting model was reﬁned in REFMAC
(Murshudov et al., 1997). Manual model rebuilding was carried out
using Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004). Crystal formB was solved by
molecular replacement (MOLREP) using the model partially reﬁned
in crystal formA.
No electron density corresponding to PLP was observed at the
cofactor-binding site in crystal formA (colourless), suggesting that
this crystal form is that of the apoenzyme. Crystal formB (yellow-
coloured) contains PLP , but disappointingly with only partial occu-
pancy, which differs between the subunits. We attribute this low
occupancy to a low afﬁnity of the protein for PLP and to the
competition of sulfate ions for cofactor binding under the crystal-
lization conditions. Crystallization condition 1 is currently being
reinvestigated for the ability to obtain full PLP occupancy, since these
conditions do not contain lithium sulfate.
The binding of PLP appears to cause signiﬁcant conformational
changes in the protein structure. These changes differ between the
two dimers, which are crystallographically equivalent in crystal form
A. This non-equivalence results in a doubling of the volume of the
triclinic unit cell in crystal formB in relation to crystal formA.T h e
structures of !-transaminase obtained from both crystal forms are
currently being reﬁned.
