Human kynurenine aminotransferase 1 (hKYAT1) plays a crucial role in the transamination of aromatic
amino acids and kynurenine. This promiscuous homodimeric enzyme transaminates various amino acids into
their corresponding α-keto acids. Additionally, hKYAT1 is known to catalyze the β-elimination of cysteine-
S conjugates and cysteine-Se conjugates. In this study, we performed mutational analyses of hKYAT1,
targeting its catalytic, ligand-binding, and substrate-binding sites. The transamination activity of 13 mutant
variants was systematically evaluated against sixteen different amino acid substrates, including kynurenine,
selenomethionine (SeMet), and Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC), as well as for the β-elimination of SeMet and
MSC. Our results demonstrate that mutations of residues E27 in the catalytic site and H279 in the substrate-
stabilizing site significantly enhanced the transamination of several amino acids, including phenylalanine,
tryptophan, histidine, and MSC. The H279F mutation increased transamination and β-elimination of MSC by
2- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Furthermore, mutation at the ligand-binding residues R398, F125 , and N185
substantially reduced MSC transamination activity of hKYAT1. Interestingly, none of the tested mutations
affected the transamination of L-kynurenine, a natural substrate of hKYAT1. Altogether, these findings
support future investigation into hKYAT1 as a modifiable target in selenium-mediated anticancer approaches.
Introduction
The metabolism of amino acids is essential for the proliferation and maintenance of all living cells. Several
amino acids serve as neurotransmitters, regulate the cellular redox status, and are involved in critical
pathways including the activation of the mTOR pathway or DNA methylation [1,2]. Notably, rapidly
proliferating cells, i.e., immune or tumor cells, exhibit a greater demand for amino acids compared with
normal cells [1,2]. Therefore, the anabolic and catabolic regulation of amino acids is essential for normal
cellular function and constitutes a critical pathway in numerous diseases.
Transamination is a pivotal step in the catabolism of a large ensemble of amino acids. To date,
at least six distinct human cytosolic transaminases have been identified, all involved in amino acid
catabolic pathways [3]. Notably, cytosolic kynurenine aminotransferase (KYAT1) catalyzes the conversion
of kynurenine (Kyn) to kynurenic acid (Kyna), a key reaction within the kynurenine pathway (KP), the
primary catabolic route for tryptophan. The KP comprises a complex cascade of reactions catalyzed by
eight different enzymes [4]. Tryptophan metabolism occurs in most cells and plays important roles in
various organs, including the kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and cells in the brain such as astrocytes and
microglia [5].
Human kynurenine aminotransferase 1 (hKYAT1, also known as KAT1) is part of the type I
aminotransferase subfamily, with aspartate aminotransferase as its prototypical member [6]. The activity
of aspartate aminotransferases is dependent on the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), which enables
the transfer of the amine group from the substrate amino acid to the formed α-keto acid [7]. To date,
four human KYAT variants (hKYAT1–hKYAT4) have been identified [4], with broad substrate specificity.
Additionally, hKYAT1 and hKYAT3 exhibit β-lyase activity toward cysteine-S conjugate and cysteine-Se
conjugate substrates that possess strong electron-withdrawing groups at the sulfur or selenium atom [8].
Notably, in vitro studies have demonstrated that hKYAT1 exhibits broad substrate specificity [8], achieving

its highest catalytic efficiency with l-glutamine (l-Gln), l-phenylalanine (l-Phe), l-leucine (l-Leu),
l-tryptophan (l-Trp), l-kynurenine (l-Kyn), and l-methionine (l-Met) [9]. Additionally, it also exhibits
significant β-lyase activity with S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC), S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-
cysteine (TFEC), and MSC [10]. This broad functional capacity accounts for the various names attributed
to hKYAT1, such as kynurenine aminotransferase 1 (EC 2.6.1.7), glutamine transaminase K (GTK) (EC
2.6.1.64), and cysteine conjugate β-lyase 1 (EC 4.4.1.13).
hKYAT1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer [11], neurodegenerative and
psychiatric disorders [12], inflammation, and obesity [13], primarily due to its role in tryptophan
metabolism within the KP . Altered hKYAT1 activity within the KP has been associated with conditions
such as cerebral ischemia [14], while significantly reduced hKYAT1 mRNA expression has been linked to
severe skeletal disorders [15]. Notably, large amounts of compounds produced along the KP play important
roles in modulating different biological processes within the organism [16–19]. However, the significance
of hKYAT1 extends beyond the KP , as it is a key component of the glutaminase II pathway. This enzyme
catalyzes the transamination of glutamine to α-ketoglutaramate (KGM) in the presence of an α-keto acid
acceptor. This reaction is coupled to α-amidase, which hydrolyzes KGM to α-ketoglutarate, facilitating its
entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [10]. Many cancers rely on increased glutamine catabolism
for energy production, often due to the decoupling of the glycolytic pathway from the TCA cycle [20].
Interestingly, both human KYAT1 and KYAT3 have been found to be overexpressed in various cancer cell
lines [10,21]. Several crystal structures of the hKYAT1 holoenzyme and hKYAT1 in complex with an array
of substrates or inhibitors have been previously determined [22–24]. While more than 500 different point
mutations have been identified in hKYAT1, none have been produced or functionally characterized. To
date, no mutational studies have clarified the role of critical residues in hKYAT1. In this study, we present
the first comprehensive mutational analysis of the substrate-binding region of hKYAT1. By evaluating the
impact of various mutations on both transamination and α-elimination activities using a diverse range of
substrates, we aimed to elucidate the molecular determinants involved in substrate recognition by hKYAT1.
These findings provide a foundation for the rational design of selective inhibitors with potential therapeutic
applications.
Results
Structure-based selection and design of mutations
Several crystal structures of hKYAT1 have been resolved in complex with the co-factors PLP (PDB
codes 1W7L [24], 3FVS [22], and 4WLH [23]), or pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP , 1W7N [24]), as
well as substrates like l-Phe (1W7M [24]), and inhibitors including indole-3-acetic acid (3FVU [22]).
hKYAT1 forms a stable homodimer with a buried interface surface area of approximately 3000 Å2 (Figure
1A). The substrate binds above the PLP ring, which is covalently linked to the lysine residue K247 in
the active site of hKYAT1. This pocket is composed of residues from both subunits (Figure 1B). To
investigate how structural features influence enzyme function, we performed targeted mutagenesis to
alter substrate-interacting residues while preserving PLP-binding integrity. Our goal was to evaluate how
specific side-chain substitutions affect substrate recognition and catalytic activity.
The crystal structure of hKYAT1 complexed with the substrate l-Phe [24] or the inhibitor IAC [22]
reveals the substrate positioned between residues F125 and H279* (Figure 1B, * indicates residues from
the other subunit). Residues N185 and R398 form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the substrate’s
α-carboxylate group, positioning its α-amino group above the PLP in a conformation conducive to
catalysis. The ligand-binding site of hKYAT1 is composed of several aromatic residues, including W18,
Y101, and F125 from one monomer, and Y63*, H279*, and F278* from the other subunit. To investigate
the role of these aromatic residues, we introduced mutations at key positions. F125H and H279F were
predicted to modulate—but not abolish—substrate binding, potentially altering activity toward aromatic
and non-aromatic substrates. R398A was introduced to test whether N185 alone could anchor the
substrate. A double mutant, N185G/R398K, was designed to determine whether lysine at position 398
could compensate for the loss of N185. In addition, N185 was mutated to glutamine (N185Q) to reduce
side-chain volume while maintaining polar character. Based on prior evidence that tyrosine residues can
substitute for arginine in substrate anchoring [22], we generated individual and combined Y216R and
R398A mutants. G36S mutant was designed to narrow the binding pocket, potentially improving substrate
selectivity.

significant domain movement. Instead, substrate-binding involves a shift in the N-terminal α1-helix
(residues P17–E27) with a pivotal movement facilitated by the glutamate residue E27. This shift tilts
the α1-helix toward the active site and is accompanied by a rotation of Y101 (Figure 1B). The proximity
between W18 and the substrate is reduced to 3.9 Å, creating optimal van der Waals interactions (Figure
1B). To test the role of this helix shift, we mutated E27 to glycine (E27G) to increase helix flexibility
and substituted W18 with smaller residues (H, M, L) to evaluate the impact of side-chain on substrate
specificity (Figure 1B).
All designed mutations are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Most activity assays were performed
using cell lysates; however, to minimize interference from endogenous factors, five key mutants (H279F ,
F125H, N185Q, N185G/R398K, and R398A) were purified and tested for transamination and β-elimination
activities in vitro. Western blot analysis confirmed that most mutants exhibited expression levels
comparable with the wildtype protein. Notably, H279F , R398A, N185Q, F125H, and W18H mutants
showed approximately two-fold higher expression (Supplementary Figure S1). Among the W18 variants,
W18H displayed the highest expression, while W18L showed the lowest.
Mutation-driven modulation of hKYAT1 activity: divergent effects on
aromatic amino acids and kynurenine
Residue substitutions in the catalytic site (helix a1, E27G), ligand-binding site (N185Q), and substrate
stabilization site (H279F) resulted in a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the transamination of l-Phe as
compared with wildtype hKYAT1 lysate (Figure 2A). In contrast, other mutants significantly reduced l-Phe
transamination (Figure 2A). The H279F substitution significantly increased the transamination activity
of the recombinant hKYAT1, corroborating the results from cell lysate assays (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
recombinant N185Q-hKYAT1 displayed significantly reduced transamination activity (Figure 2B), differing
from the increased activity observed in cell lysates (Figure 2A). Substitutions at residue 398 (R398A-
and N185G/R398K) abolished the transamination capacity of hKYAT1 for l-Phe (Figure 2B), as further
supported by enzyme kinetics showing H279F with a higher Kcat/KM ratio compared with wildtype
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Aside from the observed dichotomy for the N185Q mutant, results from both
cell lysate and recombinant protein assays were consistent. Additionally, the KM and Kcat values for the five
mutated enzyme variants support these findings (Supplementary Figure 1A, Table 1). In conclusion, while
some mutations significantly enhance transaminase activity, others completely abolish it, underscoring the
critical roles of the selected residues in l-Phe transamination.
Tryptophan is another important aromatic amino acid substrate for hKYAT1. Most of the tested
mutants either abolished or reduced hKYAT1’s transamination activity toward l-Trp, except for the E27G
mutant, which resulted in a two-fold increase in activity compared with wildtype hKYAT1 lysate (Figure
2C). Notably, the W18H and N185Q mutants did not affect l-Trp transamination in cell lysates as
compared with the wildtype (Figure 2C). As observed for l-Phe, the results from recombinant proteins
both confirmed and contrasted with the cell lysate data (Figure 2C and D). While the H279F variant
displayed a 1.5-fold increase in activity compared with wildtype hKYAT1 in recombinant protein assays,
no significant difference was observed in the cell lysates (Figure 2C and D). Interestingly, the recombinant
protein results showed similar mutational effects for both l-Phe and l-Trp (Figure 2B), aligning well
with the KM and Kcat values for these substrates (Supplementary Figure S1B, Table 1). The same set of
mutants was tested with dl-Tyr (Supplementary Figure 2A & 2B). The E27G mutant exhibited comparable
transamination activity with wildtype hKYAT1 for dl-Tyr, while all other mutants reduced hKYAT1’s
activity toward l-Tyr. These findings were confirmed by recombinant assays, where most mutants abolished
dl-Tyr transamination, except for H279F (Supplementary Figure 2A & 2B).
A major function of hKYAT1 is the transamination of l-Kyn to Kyna. Interestingly, mutants W18H,
W18M/H279F , E27G, F125H, H279F , and R398A increased the enzymatic activity of hKYAT1 toward
l-Kyn by two- to four-fold in cell lysates (Figure 2E), a pattern that contrasts with the activity observed
for l-Phe and l-Trp (Figure 2A, C and D). However, all five tested recombinant mutants either reduced
or abolished l-Kyna production as compared with the wildtype (Figure 2F). The KM and Kcat values for
the mutant recombinant hKYAT1 variants toward l-Kyn also differed significantly from those for l-Phe
and l-Trp. Specifically, all five recombinant mutants, including H279F, exhibited lower Kcat/KM ratios as
compared with the wildtype, indicating lower catalytic efficiency for l-Kyn transamination (Supplementary
Figures S1A, S1B & S1C, Table 1).

Overall, our results indicate that hKYAT1 employs different key residues for transamination depending
on the substrate, whether it be aromatic amino acids or kynurenine. Interestingly, the expression levels of
the recombinant proteins did not directly correlate with hKYAT1 enzymatic activity (Supplementary Figure

3A & 3B). For instance, while H279F-hKYAT1 exhibited significantly higher transamination activity
toward l-Phe, the F125H- and R398A-hKYAT1 variants showed no transamination capacity for these
substrates. Even though the expression levels of F125H- and R398A-hKYAT1 were twice as high as
wildtype-hKYAT1, they displayed no transamination activity across a broad range of tested substrates.
Mutational analysis and substrate preferences of hKYAT1 highlight key
residues in transamination activity
Amidic amino acids are essential for cancer cell survival as they can be converted into their respective
α-keto acids via transamination. Notably, essential α-keto acids, such as α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate,
which are derived from the transamination of glutamine and asparagine, respectively, play crucial roles
in cell survival as key components of the TCA cycle. Overexpression of hKYAT1 in HEPG2 cells resulted
in a five-fold increase in l-Gln transamination compared with control cell lysates (Figure 3). However,
mutations of residues in the ligand recognition site (W18), stabilization site (F125, Y216, and R398),
and substrate stabilization site (H279) significantly reduced or completely abrogated enzymatic activity
toward l-Gln. In contrast, mutations at the catalytic site (E27) increased hKYAT1 transamination activity
toward l-Gln, while mutation of N185 in the ligand-binding site showed activity as comparable with
wildtype hKYAT1 (Figure 3A). These findings were consistent with the results obtained using recombinant
proteins (Figure 3B). Furthermore, transamination activity toward l-asparagine (l-Asn) was minimal
across all tested mutants using both cell lysates and recombinant proteins. However, mutation at W18L
and N185Q exhibited a notable increase in transamination activity as compared with wildtype hKYAT1
cell lysates (Figure 3C), and interestingly, recombinant F125H-hKYAT1 displayed a significant increase
in transamination activity compared with wildtype hKYAT1 (Figure 3D). Similarly, hKYAT1 exhibited
minimal activity with the acidic amino acid l-aspartic acid (l-Asp), a finding consistent across both
cell lysate and recombinant protein assays (Supplementary Figure S3C, & 3D). While some mutations
suggested a modest increase in transamination activity in cell lysates, recombinant protein assays
confirmed that l-Asn and l-Asp are not major substrates to hKYAT1 (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure
S3D). Most hKYAT1 mutants displayed reduced transamination activity toward l-histidine (l-His) in
cell lysate assays, except for the E27G mutant, which showed enhanced activity (Figure 3E). Conversely,
recombinant H279F displayed a significant increase in l-His transamination compared with wildtype
hKYAT1, while all other mutants abrogated transamination activity (Figure 3F). These results underscore
the importance of residue H279 in l-His transamination (Figure 3E and F).
Wildtype hKYAT1 overexpression had a profound impact on the transamination of the sulfur-
containing amino acid methionine, resulting in a nine-fold increase in transamination activity as
compared with control lysates (Figure 3G). Interestingly, all tested mutants significantly reduced hKYAT1’s
transamination activity toward dl-Met in cell lysates (Figure 3G). This was further confirmed in
recombinant protein assays, where all mutants, except H279F , partially abrogated dl-Met transamination
(Figure 3H). Additionally, hKYAT1 displayed minimal activity with l-cystine (l-Cyss), a result
corroborated by both cell lysate and recombinant protein assays (Supplementary Figure S3E, &3F).
hKYAT1 efficiently transaminated the aliphatic amino acid l-Leu, exhibiting a seven-fold increase in
transamination activity as compared with control lysates (Figure 3I). Notably, the W18H and G36S
mutants significantly increased transamination activity toward l-Leu compared with wildtype hKYAT1
(Figure 3I). In contrast, mutation of residue W18 to leucine (W18L) or methionine (W18M) reduced
transamination activity toward l-Leu (Figure 3I). Several other mutants, including R398A, N185G/R398K,
and Y216R/R398A, also reduced or abrogated l-Leu transamination, highlighting the importance of R398
in l-Leu transamination (Figure 3I). These results were validated by recombinant protein assays (Figure
3J). Additionally, we tested smaller hydrophobic substrates such as l-alanine (l-Ala), proline (Pro), and
Gly. While some transamination activity was detected, these residues are not primary substrates for
hKYAT1 (Supplementary Figure S3G,3H, 3I, 3J, 3K, & 3L). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that
Gln, Met, His, and Leu are the most favorable substrates for hKYAT1, while Asn, Asp, Cyss, Ala, Pro, and
glycine (Gly) are the least preferred substrates.

Functional characterization of hKYAT1 mutants: enhanced activity with
MSC compared with SeMet
KYAT1 transaminates Se-conjugated compounds, including MSC and SeMet, converting them to β-
methylselenopyruvate (MSP) and α-keto-γ-methylselenobutyrate (KMSB), respectively. The Y216R/R398A
mutant displayed elevated MSC transamination activity compared with wildtype, while mutants such as
W18H, E27G, G36S, and H279F showed comparable MSC transamination activity with wildtype hKYAT1
(Figure 4A). Substitution of the aromatic residue at position 279 (H279F) resulted in a two-fold increase
in MSC transamination activity in recombinant proteins as compared with wildtype (Figure 4B). This
increased transamination activity in the H279F mutant was reflected in the MSC kinetics, with KM and
Kcat values of 15.7 ± 5.4 and 0.8 ± 0.15 mM, and 12840 ± 2973 and 5096 ± 191 s-1 for wildtype and
H279F , respectively (Supplementary Figure S1D, Table 1). In contrast, none of the tested hKYAT1 mutants
showed any significant transamination activity with SeMet, compared with wildtype hKYAT1 cell lysate,
although hKYAT1-overexpressed cell lysates (wildtype or mutant) demonstrated significant transamination
activity as compared with control cell lysates (Figure 4C). These results suggest that hKYAT1 preferentially
transaminates MSC over SeMet (Figure 4D). The SeMet kinetics for wildtype and mutant hKYAT1 further
support this preference, showing KM and Kcat values of 17.9 ± 6.8 and 119.6 ± 7.0 mM, and 2668 ± 645 and
12739 ± 20546 s-1 for wildtype hKYAT1 and H279F , respectively (Supplementary Figure S1D , Table 1).
In addition to cystine S-conjugates, hKYAT1 metabolizes Se-conjugates including MSC and SeMet,
exhibiting β-elimination activity that cleaves MSC and SeMet into MS. This is attributed to the weaker
C-Se bond compared with the C-S bond. Our data demonstrated that hKYAT1 induction enhanced
β-elimination activity two-fold with MSC. Mutants such as W18L, G36S, N185G/R398K, and Y216R/
R398A decreased β-elimination activity as compared with wildtype in the cell lysates (Figure 4E), while all
other mutants showed similar β-elimination activity to wildtype in cell lysates (Figure 4E). In recombinant
proteins, the H279F mutant exhibited a significant increase in β-elimination activity compared with
wildtype (Figure 4F). This elevated β-elimination activity for both wildtype and the H279F mutant in
recombinant proteins was reflected in their KM and Kcat values (Supplementary Figure S1F, Table 1).
SeMet was also tested for β-elimination activity in both wildtype and mutant hKYAT1. We observed
elevated β-elimination activity for SeMet in hKYAT1-overexpressing cell lysates compared with control
lysates. Different hKYAT1 mutants exhibited varying abilities to cleave SeMet into MS via β-elimination
activity (Figure 4G). Results obtained with recombinant mutant and wildtype enzymes indicated that
SeMet is not a preferred β-elimination substrate for hKYAT1 compared with MSC (Figure 4H). This
preference was further confirmed by the KM, Kcat, and Kcat/KM values for SeMet (Supplementary Figure
S1G, Table 1). A comparison of β-elimination activity between HEPG2 cell lysates and recombinant
proteins for MSC and SeMet confirmed that MSC is favored as a substrate of hKYAT1 over SeMet.
Discussion
Human KYAT1 plays a crucial role in recovering α-keto acid analogs from several essential amino acids
through transamination reactions [8,25]. It is a key enzyme in the metabolism of the essential amino
acid tryptophan, serving as the primary source for de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
biosynthesis [16]. It transfers an amino group from kynurenine (an amino group donor in the Trp
pathway) to α-ketoglutarate (an amino group acceptor), producing anthranilic acid and glutamate. The
activity of hKYAT1, which exhibits broad substrate specificity, is regulated by multiple factors, including
substrate availability, cofactors, and cellular energy status. As such, this crucial enzyme is involved in a
range of physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegeneration, inflammation, and cancer
[26,27].
The presence of aromatic residues in the ligand-binding region of hKYAT1 is crucial for substrate
recognition [22,24]. Mutation analysis of catalytic, ligand-binding, and substrate-stabilization sites is
therefore essential to understand the enzyme’s specificity toward its broad range of substrates. In this study,
we identified and mutated several key residues in hKYAT1 and systematically characterized the effects
of each substitution on a large array of amino acid substrates. It is well established that hKYAT1 prefers
different α-keto acids (amino group acceptors) depending on the substrate [8]. For example, hKYAT1
utilizes α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and 2-keto-butyric acid (KBA) for the transamination
of phenylalanine and kynurenine, respectively, while α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and KMB are required for
β-elimination activity with MSC. We carefully evaluated various α-keto acids (KMB, KBA, αKG, pyruvate,

phenylpyruvate (PPA), and glyoxylate) for their transamination activity with different substrates. Our
results demonstrated that KMB, KBA, and PPA were the primary α-keto acid (amino group acceptors) for
hKYAT1, with αKG showing the least activity, which is supported by the previous studies [8,28].
In addition, hKYAT1 is highly efficient at metabolizing α-keto acids into their corresponding amino
acids, catalyzing reactions including the conversion of phenylpyruvate (PPA) to l-Phe, and indole-3-
pyruvate (IPA) to l-Trp [3,29]. Previous studies have shown that hKYAT1 prefers transamination of
IPA to l-Trp over transamination of l-Trp to IPA [3]. These findings align with our results, which
demonstrated increased transamination of aromatic amino acids like Phe and Trp. Aromatic amino acids
are essential for various physiological functions, including quenching reactive oxygen species, providing
neuroprotection, and facilitating signal transmission [10,30,31]. Defects in their metabolism can have
significant repercussions on human health [32].
In this study, we demonstrated that mutations in the substrate binding site (H279) and catalytic site
(E27) significantly modulated the transamination activity of hKYAT1 for all aromatic amino acids in
experiments performed in cell lysates. To our knowledge, the only reported naturally occurring mutant
variant is the E61G mutation in rat KYAT1 (rKYAT1). It should be noted that residue E61 in rKYAT1
corresponds to E27 in hKYAT1 [33]. Rossi et al. previously proposed that E27 plays a critical role
in the catalytic site of hKYAT1, where its mutation reduced enzyme activity and caused hypertension
in rats [9,33]. However, we observed the opposite, since E27 increased the activity in this study. This
could be due to greater flexibility in the α1-helix, potentially enhancing the adaptability of the active
site for larger substrates [34]. The E27G mutant increased enzymatic activity across most substrates,
particularly Gln, but showed only moderate activity with Asp. These trends suggest a possible role for
Gln-derived metabolites, like αKG, in fueling the TCA cycle and maintaining anaplerosis; however, this
interpretation is based on lysate data and would require recombinant validation for confirmation [31,35].
Comparison of the crystal structure of hKYAT1 in complex with different substrates revealed that the
lateral movement of the α1-helix is necessary for accommodating larger ligands, but not small ones [22].
Residue H279 forms a hydrogen bond with bound substrates and plays a key role in stabilizing ligands,
as demonstrated in the crystal structure of hKYAT1 [24]. Our findings show that the recombinant H279F
mutant significantly increased hKYAT1 activity toward Phe, Trp, His, and MSC but reduced activity toward
Tyr, Gln, Met, Gly, Cyss, and Kyn. Although the E27G mutant consistently exhibited increased activity
across several substrates in lysate-based assays, it was not included in the recombinant protein analysis due
to prioritization of functionally distinct variants. Given its position in the α1-helix and potential role in
enhancing structural flexibility, E27G remains an intriguing candidate for future structural and enzymatic
characterization.
We observed in a few cases contradictory transamination activities between cell lysates and
recombinant proteins. This variation could be attributed to the presence of other enzymes present in the
whole-cell lysates, such as ω-amidase, tyrosine transaminase (TAT), and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase
(MDH1), which are involved in the Trp salvage pathway [3] or due to changes in expression levels of
the mutated protein. Indeed, it is known that mutated proteins can have an expression level different
from that of the wildtype protein [36]. For example, in HCM patients heterozygous for mutations in the
MYH7 gene encoding for the β-myosin heavy chain, expression of the mutant and the wildtype allele can
be unequal and fractions of mutant and wildtype mRNA and protein significantly deviate from 1:1 [37].
Even synonymous mutation of the gene can change the expression of the protein due to the position and
context of codons in the genes, recombination rates, mRNA folding and stability, tRNA abundance, and
so on [38]. There is growing evidence that some synonymous mutations can cause disease through the
disruption of different processes of protein production [39]. Additionally, since hKYAT1 functions as a
homodimer, mutant KYAT1 subunits may heterodimerize with endogenous wildtype hKYAT1, potentially
affecting transamination activity in lysate assays. To ensure accurate interpretation of mutation-specific
effects, we complemented lysate-based assays with purified recombinant proteins. This approach provided a
controlled system to assess catalytic activity without interference from endogenous KYAT1.
Residue F125 is conserved across mammalian KYAT proteins, but in human KYAT2 and KYAT3, F125
is replaced by Tyr. In KYAT2, the Y125F mutant resulted in a 20-fold reduction in β-lytic activity [40].
Our findings indicate that the F125H mutant significantly affected substrate binding across all tested amino
acid substrates. Residue W18, located at the hinge of the α1-helix, plays a critical role in ligand recognition
and stabilization [22]. Mutation at this residue inactivated hKYAT1 with most amino acids except Asp;
notably, hKYAT1 has minimal activity toward Asp. Interestingly, the W18H mutant exhibited increased
transamination activity for Kyn and Leu, although expression levels were double that of the wildtype

(supplementary Figure 3). Residue G36, located at the entrance of the substrate channel, plays a critical
role, as demonstrated by the G36S mutant, which showed two-fold higher transamination activity for
Leu compared with the wildtype. Mutation at N185 and R398, both key residues in the ligand-binding
regions [22,24], revealed additional insights. The N185Q/G mutants exhibited moderate activity for most
substrates, with notably higher activity for l-Phe. In contrast, the R398A and Y216R mutant resulted in
complete inactivation of hKYAT1, confirming the critical role of these residues in catalysis and any residual
changes at this site completely destabilize the enzyme.
Transamination of Kyn to Kyna is a key step in the KP , which plays an important role in inflammatory
responses, immunoregulation, and psychiatric disorders [41]. Kyna is considered neuroprotective,
suppressing several inflammatory pathways and playing a significant role in immune responses by
activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) [41]. Interestingly, while the transamination of Kyn
increased in hKYAT1 mutants in cell lysates, recombinant hKYAT1 mutants showed the opposite trend.
This discrepancy suggests that Kyna production may not occur under recombinant conditions and could
require additional factors, such as cofactors or other enzymes, to drive the reaction or due to higher
expression levels of the mutated protein, notably W18H, F125H, N185Q, H279F , and R398A. It has been
reported that Kyna does not cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas Kyn does, suggesting that Kyna is
synthesized in the brain [42].
Our results demonstrated significantly higher transamination and β-elimination activity for the H279F
mutants with MSC, but not with SeMet. The transamination and β-elimination of MSC result in the
formation of β-MSP and methylselenol (MS), respectively [42]. In contrast, the transamination and
β-elimination of SeMet generate KMSB and MS, respectively [43]. Both MSC and SeMet metabolites
are known to modulate tumor cell growth and possess chemopreventive activities [43,44]. Specifically, MSP
has been reported to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), as it structurally resembles butyrate, a potent
HDAC inhibitor [43]. Additionally, the β-elimination products of MSC and SeMet can alter the redox
balance, leading to changes in cell signaling pathways and the induction of proapoptotic genes in various
cancers [45]. Zeng et al. (2006) reported that MS down-regulates the BCL2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1),
leading to increased cytochrome C release into the cytoplasm and initiation of apoptotic events [46,47].
Moreover, MSC has been shown to induce apoptosis by activating multiple kinase signaling pathways and
by participating in the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway during inflammatory responses [48]. In
our study, elevated β-elimination activity with MSC was observed in both the E27G and H279F mutants in
cell lysates. Furthermore, the recombinant H279F mutant exhibited higher β-elimination activity with MSC
compared with the wildtype. In contrast, the other tested recombinant proteins displayed β-elimination
activity similar to the wildtype, with the exception of F125H. Interestingly, only the wildtype enzyme
showed moderate β-elimination activity with SeMet, further confirming that KYAT1 preferentially utilizes
MSC as a substrate over SeMet, consistent with previous findings [49].
Despite transfecting equal quantities of mutant hKYAT1 plasmids into HEPG2 cells, we observed
variability in expression levels among the mutants (Supplementary Figure S3A & 3B). Interestingly, the
effect of these mutations appeared to be substrate-dependent. For example, while the H279F , R398A, and
F125H mutants showed a two-fold increase in protein expression as compared with wildtype, this did not
directly correlate with enzyme activity. Specifically, the H279F mutant displayed higher transamination
activity toward l-Phe, whereas the R398A and F125H mutants showed minimal transamination activity
toward l-Phe. Additionally, despite its expression being twice as high as wildtype, the R398A mutant
showed no significant activity toward several amino acid substrates (Supplementary Figure S3A & 3B).
These observations were further validated in recombinant hKYAT1 assays, where an equal quantity of
hKYAT1 mutants (H279F , R398A, and F125H) was used in all transamination and β-elimination assays.
This underscores the importance of substrate specificity and the differential impact of mutations on
hKYAT1 enzyme activity.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the transamination and β-elimination activity of hKYAT1
mutants vary depending on the substrate and the residues involved. We identified two key mutants,
H279F and E27G, that significantly enhanced transamination activity toward several hKYAT1-preferred
substrates, including MSC. These findings highlight the possibility of tuning hKYAT1 function through
targeted mutagenesis to optimize the metabolism of selenoamino acids with antineoplastic potential.
While these results are promising, further investigation is necessary to understand the structural and
physiological implications of these mutations in vivo. Continued exploration of KYAT1 variants in
disease-relevant models will be critical to evaluate their potential utility in therapeutic strategies involving
selenium metabolism.

Cell culture and growth conditions
HEPG2 cells were purchased from ATCC (Wesel, Germany) and maintained in EMEM (ATCC)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Paisley, UK) under 5% CO2
at 37°C without antibiotics. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert

(Bio-Rad, Portland, ME, U.S.A.).
Cloning and cellular overexpression of hKYAT1 and mutant variants
The full-length human KYAT1 (hKYAT1) coding sequence was amplified from cDNA and cloned into
the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Takara Bio Inc., CA, U.S.A.). The human
PGK promoter and puromycin resistance gene sequences were amplified from pLKO.1 (Sigma Aldrich,
Darmstadt, Germany) and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 backbone containing the hKYAT1 expression
vector. Point mutations were introduced in this hKYAT1 backbone, and all mutants were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. An empty vector was created by inserting the PCR-amplified puromycin resistance

Overexpression of wildtype and mutated hKYAT1 variants in HEPG2
cells
HEPG2 cells were seeded at 400 cells/mm2 in six-well plates. Twenty hours later, cells were transfected
with 2 µg of plasmids DNA encoding wildtype or mutant hKYAT1 using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen,
U.S.A.). An empty vector served as a negative control. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and
protein expression was verified by Western blot. Whole-cell lysates were used for subsequent enzyme
assays.
Determination of protein concentration
Samples were lysed on ice for 30 min in RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1% protease inhibitor
cocktail mix, followed by sonication at 4°C for 30 s. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10
min at 4°C, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce™
Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay optimization
Assay conditions, including buffer composition, pH, and choice of α-keto acid, were optimized individually
for each substrate to reflect its known or experimentally determined enzymatic requirements. KYAT1
catalyzes diverse amino acid substrates, each with different reactivity profiles, stability, and preferred
α-keto acid acceptors. For example, β-elimination reactions involving selenoamino acids (MSC and SeMet)
were performed at alkaline pH (ammediol buffer, pH 9.0) to facilitate selenium bond cleavage, while
transamination reactions were adjusted based on optimal conversion rates for each amino acid–keto acid
pair. This substrate-specific approach allowed us to capture physiologically relevant activity patterns and
minimize assay artifacts arising from non-ideal conditions.
Transamination assay for L-Phe
Transamination assay for l-Phe was performed according to a previously published protocol [42]. Briefly,
50 µl reaction containing 20 mM l-Phe, 5 mM KMB, 100 mM ammediol-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), and 200
ng of purified hKYAT1 or 20 µg of whole cell lysate protein. 0–100 mM l-Phe were used to determine
Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and stopped by adding 150 µl
of 1 M NaOH. Phenylpyruvate-enol (PPA-enol) formation was quantified by absorbance at 320 nm (ε
= 16,000 M⁻¹cm⁻¹) using a PowerWave HT spectrophotometer (BioTek) and UV-transparent flat-bottom
plates (Costar). Reactions without enzyme served as blanks.
Transamination assays for L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Cyss, L-Gln, dL-Met, Gly, Pro,
SeMet, and MSC
The assays for l-Leu, l-Ala, l-Cyss, l-Gln, dl-Met, Gly, Pro, SeMet, and MSC were performed according
to a previously published protocol [51]. Briefly, 50 µl reaction mixture containing 200 mM potassium
phosphate EDTA buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM Se-methylselenocysteine, and 0.6 mM PPA. The mixture was
pre-incubated at 37°C for 5 min, followed by the addition of either 20 µg of whole-cell extract or 200 ng of
purified hKYAT1 enzyme. 0–10 mM MSC or 0–15mM of SeMet were used to determine Michaelis–Menten
kinetics. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for an additional 10 min and then terminated by adding 150 µl
of 1 N NaOH. The consumption of phenylpyruvate was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 320 nm
(ε = 16,000 M⁻¹cm⁻¹) using a PowerWave HT spectrophotometer (BioTek) in UV-transparent flat-bottom
plates (Costar). Reactions without enzyme served as blanks.
Transamination of L-Trp, dL-Tyr, and L-His
Transamination of l-Trp, dl-Tyr, and l-His was measured following a modified version of the published
protocol [52]. Briefly, 20 µg of whole-cell lysate or 200 ng of purified recombinant hKYAT1 was added
to 100 µL of reaction mixture containing 3 mM amino acid, 5 mM KMB, 70 µM PLP , and 300 mM
ammediol-HCl buffer (pH 9.6). 0–5 mM l-Trp were used to determine Michaelis–Menten kinetics. After

incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 7 µl of 50% trichloroacetic acid
(TCA). The mixture was thereafter vortexed and centrifuged for 2 min at maximum speed. Then, 250 µl of
1 M arsenate–borate reagent (pH 6.0) was added to 50 µl of the reaction mixture, and the reaction mixture
was vortexed and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance was acquired
at 292 nm for l-His (imidazolepyruvate, ε = 11,300), 310 nm for dl-Tyr (p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, ε
= 10,700), and 330 nm for l-Trp (indolepyruvate, ε = 10,800) in a spectrophotometer (PowerWave HT,
BioTek, U.S.A.). A mixture in which KMB was added immediately before adding 50% TCA was used as a
blank.
Transamination of L-Kyn to L-Kyna
Trasamination of l-Kyn to l-Kyna with KBA as α-keto acid was performed using a 50 µl reaction mixture
that contained 3 mM l-Kyn, 5 mM KBA, 200 µM PLP , and 300 mM ammediol-HCl buffer (pH 9.6), to
which 40 µg of whole-cell lysate or 400 ng of recombinant hKYAT1 was added. 0–5 mM l-Kyn were used
to determine Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The assay mixture was incubated at 37°C for 6 h, and the reaction
was terminated by adding 3.5 µl of 50% TCA. The assay mixture was thereafter vortexed and centrifuged
for 2 min at maximal speed. Then, 180 µl 500 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 was added to 20 µl of the
reaction mixture, and absorbance was read immediately at 330 nm in a spectrophotometer (PowerWave
HT, BioTek, U.S.A.). Under this condition, the molar extinction coefficient is 8850 M−1 cm−1 for l-Kyna
[53]. A mixture in which KBA was added immediately before adding 50% TCA was used as a blank.
β-elimination activity for MSC and SeMet
β-elimination activity was measured for MSC and SeMet according to a previously published method [42].
Briefly, 100 µL reaction mixture contained 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MSC,
100 µM each of αKG and KMB, 10 µM PLP , 0.5 µg mammalian TrxR1, 400 µM NADPH, and either 200
ng of purified hKYAT1 or 20 µg of whole cell lysate protein. 0–10 mM MSC or 0–15mM of SeMet were
used to determine Michaelis-Menten kinetics. After a 5 min pre-incubation at 37°C (excluding TrxR1
and NADPH), reactions were initiated by addition of TrxR1 and NADPH. NADPH consumption was
continuously monitored at 340 nm every 30 sec using a PowerWave HT spectrophotometer (BioTek). A
reaction without TrxR1 served as a blank. The molar extinction coefficient for NADPH was 6220 M⁻¹cm⁻¹.
TrxR1 was added in excess to ensure saturation and allow accurate calculation of hKYAT1 kinetics.
Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis was performed by loading 20 µg protein isolated from whole-cell lysates onto a
4–20% Mini-PROTEAN gel, followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, U.S.A.). Membranes
were blocked with 5% milk in TBST for two hours, then incubated with primary antibodies against
KYAT1 (PA5-51313, 1:1000 in 5% BSA) (Sigma, Germany) overnight at 4°C. Vinculin (Millipore, U.S.A.)
was used as a loading control. Membranes were washed and incubated for one hour with a secondary
antibody, polyclonal swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins/HRP (P0399) diluted 1:10,000 in 5% milk (DAKO,
Denmark). Membranes were subsequently washed three times with TBST, and blot images were acquired
using the Odyssey Fc Imaging System (LI-COR, U.S.A.). Protein levels were quantified using Odyssey
Image software (LI-COR Biosciences, U.S.A.), by normalizing primary antibody signals to vinculin.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD (n ≥ 3) and are displayed using box and whisker plots or violin plots.
Statistical analyses were conducted using one-way ANOV A with a 95% confidence interval, followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Data were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.2, GraphPad Software Inc., U.S.A.).
