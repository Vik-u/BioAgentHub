ABSTRACT
Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, has 
provided great improvements in lung function and well-  being for people with CF. The use of ETI has been complicated by re -
ports of rare but significant liver function test elevations in clinical trials and drug-  induced liver injury (DILI) in real-  world use. 
Previous research by our group revealed that oxidative stress is the major driver of ETI-  mediated DILI, and in silico ETI DILI 
simulations resulted in elevations of the emerging biomarker glutamine dehydrogenase (GLDH) which match the time course 
of predicted transaminase elevations. The assessment of emerging biomarkers and therapeutic strategies in a clinically relevant 
model will spur the development of more effective treatments for ETI-  mediated DILI. This study used the human-  relevant liver- 
on- chip model to investigate GLDH as a biomarker and ETI dose reduction and silymarin antioxidant administration as thera -
peutic strategies for ETI-  mediated DILI. We found that GLDH was not as sensitive as ALT and albumin for detecting DILI due 
to ETI. Dose reduction was a more effective treatment strategy for ETI DILI than silymarin, which did not significantly lower 
ALT levels.
1   |   Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by defec -
tive chloride ion transport due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to 
a progressive decline in lung function coupled with chronic re -
spiratory infections and organ dysfunction [ 1]. The introduction 
of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), a triple-  combination 
corrector- potentiator therapy, has revolutionized CF treatment 
by providing significant clinical benefits, including improved 
lung function, reduced pulmonary exacerbations, and enhanced 
quality of life, for patients with at least one F508del mutation, 
encompassing approximately 90% of the CF population [ 2]. 
However, despite its transformative impact, evidence highlights 
a rare but serious risk of drug-  induced liver injury (DILI) 
associated with ETI use.
Clinical trials and post-  marketing surveillance have re -
ported elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, and, in rare cases, 
severe hepatotoxicity necessitating treatment discontinu -
ation [ 3]. For instance, phase III trials of ETI noted alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) elevations in up to 10% of patients, with severe cases 
(< 1%) requiring close monitoring or withdrawal [ 2, 4 ]. Case 
reports have further documented idiosyncratic DILI, includ -
ing instances of acute liver failure and delayed hepatic ne -
crosis [ 5–8]. Mechanistic studies from our group suggest that 
ETI's components, particularly ivacaftor, induce significant

oxidative stress in hepatocytes, contributing to liver injury 
[9]. Currently, there are no known early-  stage biomarkers and 
therapeutics for ETI-  induced DILI. In silico modeling of ETI 
DILI by our group predicted elevations in glutamate dehydro -
genase (GLDH), an emerging biomarker for DILI, following a 
similar time course as ALT and AST. The model also predicted 
that ETI dose reduction and hypothetical antioxidant admin -
istration significantly reduced the frequency of transaminase 
elevations. Further investigations into this novel biomarker, 
GLDH, and potential therapeutic strategies for ETI-  mediated 
DILI in a clinically relevant model are needed to improve 
the safety of highly effective modulator therapies for people 
with CF.
Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) is a liver-  specific mitochon -
drial enzyme and an emerging biomarker for DILI. GLDH is 
involved in amino acid oxidation and urea production and is 
expressed in the mitochondrial matrix of hepatocytes [ 10, 11]. 
GLDH is highly liver-  specific: unlike ALT and AST, the levels 
of GLDH are not elevated in response to muscle injury [ 11]. 
Therefore, GLDH is less likely to be a false positive marker for 
liver injury than transaminases. Elevated serum GLDH indi -
cates a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, which could 
result from the DILI mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction 
[12]. Accordingly, for liver injury induced in rats by acetamin -
ophen, which is known to cause mitochondrial damage, serum 
GLDH levels became significantly elevated ( p < 0.001) in 24 h 
and were higher than those of ALT [ 13]. In human subjects fol -
lowing acetaminophen administration, GLDH and ALT levels 
were highly correlated (r = 0.88) [14].
Silymarin, historically used to treat liver disorders, is the 
extract of the milk thistle plant (Silybum marinum) contain -
ing the major active component silibinin (aka silybin) [ 15]. 
Silymarin exhibits antioxidant effects that prevent lipid per -
oxidation from reactive oxygen species, helping maintain the 
fluidity of the liver cell membrane and improving its resilience 
against injury [ 16]. A prospective study comparing silymarin 
and ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA, an anticholestatic agent) on 
anticonvulsive drug-  induced hypertransaminasemia showed 
superiority for the effect of silymarin on DILI, as the reduction 
in ALT was significantly greater ( p = 0.017) in the silymarin 
group than in the UCDA group after 1 month of treatment, 
with minimal side effects [ 17]. In addition, a multicenter, 
retrospective, non-  intervention cohort study found that 
the administration of silibinin significantly improved liver 
function tests in patients with DILI [ 18]. A meta-  analysis of 
randomized controlled trials (RCT) of silymarin as a prophy -
lactic therapy for antituberculosis drug-  induced liver injury 
revealed that silymarin significantly reduced ALT ( p < 0.001) 
and AST ( p = 0.001) levels vs. placebo among a total of 1198 
(585 in silymarin groups and 613 in placebo groups) patients 
across five RCTs [ 19].
Conventional animal models, while widely used, often fail 
to predict human-  specific DILI due to differences in hepatic 
metabolism, immune responses, and drug pharmacokinetics 
[20, 21 ]. The human quad-  culture liver-  on- chip system (aka 
liver chip) addresses these limitations by recapitulating the 
human liver microenvironment in  vitro. This microfluidic 
platform integrates primary human hepatocytes, liver sinu -
soidal endothelial cells, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells under 
dynamic flow conditions, mimicking physiological blood per -
fusion and bile canalicular function. Validated for DILI as -
sessment, the liver chip accurately detects clinical biomarkers 
of liver injury in response to known hepatotoxic compounds 
with high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (100%), surpassing 
the predictive capacity of traditional 2D hepatocyte cultures 
and animal models [ 22, 23].
This study leverages the liver chip to investigate ETI-  induced 
DILI. The objectives of our study are (1) to identify biomarkers 
of ETI liver injury in response to daily ETI exposure; and (2) 
to evaluate the therapeutic strategies of dose reduction and a 
candidate antioxidant therapeutic, silymarin, aimed at attenu -
ating hepatotoxicity. By investigating the biomarkers underly -
ing ETI- mediated DILI and testing potential interventions, this 
project seeks to reduce the risk of this rare but life-  threatening 
Study Highlights
• What is the current knowledge on the topic?
○ Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), a triple-  
combination therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), pro -
vides significant quality of life improvements for 
people with CF, but its use has led to drug-  induced 
liver injury (DILI) in clinical trials and case reports. 
Research from our group has demonstrated that 
oxidative stress is the main driver of ETI DILI, and 
in silico simulations predicted elevations in gluta -
mate dehydrogenase (GLDH), an emerging DILI 
biomarker, and that antioxidant treatment and ETI 
dose reduction resulted in lower frequencies of ALT 
elevations. However, neither GLDH, nor ETI dose 
reduction, nor antioxidant administration has been 
assessed using a clinically relevant platform.
• What question did this study address?
○ This study addresses the need to identify biomarkers 
of ETI-  mediated DILI and evaluate therapeutic ap -
proaches to treat DILI. Due to its greater similarity 
to the human liver and validated accuracy in identi -
fying hepatotoxic compounds, the liver-  on- chip sys-
tem (liver chip) was used to assess DILI biomarkers, 
including GLDH, and therapeutic strategies such 
as silymarin (antioxidant) administration and dose 
reduction.
• What does this study add to our knowledge?
○ Elevations in ALT and urea as well as decreases 
in albumin levels are indicative of ETI-  mediated 
DILI, while GLDH is less predictive as a biomarker. 
Silymarin administered with ETI did not signifi -
cantly lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 
while reduced-  dose ETI resulted in significantly 
lower ALT levels.
• How might this change clinical pharmacology or 
translational science?
○ The liver-  on- chip platform has been demonstrated 
by this study to be effective in post-  marketing DILI 
investigations for ETI. Similar experiments to as -
sess biomarkers and treatment modalities may be 
performed for other drugs on the market known to 
cause DILI.

complication, thereby enhancing the safety profile of this 
transformative therapy for CF patients.
2   |   Methods
2.1   |   Liver- On- Chip Culture 
and Experimental Setup
The liver-  on- chip system (Emulate Inc., Boston, MA) was 
used to model human liver responses to ETI and evaluate po -
tential therapeutic interventions. Each chip comprised two 
channels separated by a porous membrane: a top channel 
seeded with primary human hepatocytes (LifeNet Health, no 
catalog #, Lot 2214423-  01) and a bottom channel seeded with 
non- parenchymal cells (NPCs), including primary human 
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Cell Systems, Cat. 
# ACBRI 566, Lot 566.04.05.05.0 M), primary human hepatic 
stellate cells (LifeNet Health, no catalog #, Lot 2222162p0), 
and primary human Kupffer cells (LifeNet Health, no cata -
log #, Lot 2118082). Chips were prepared and cells were cul -
tured under dynamic flow conditions (100 μL/h) in hepatocyte 
maintenance medium and NPC medium supplemented with 
2% fetal bovine serum according to Emulate protocols as de -
scribed by Shi et al. [ 24]. The media were prepared following 
Emulate protocols and the flow rate was chosen to minimize 
absorption of ETI by the PDMS membrane of the liver chip 
by rapidly saturating the membrane with the drug so that 
further absorption would be minimal. In a preliminary assay 
using blank liver chips without cells, a flow rate of 100 μL/h 
achieved a recovered concentration (chip outflow concen -
tration/dosing concentration) of greater than 95% for all ETI 
compounds within 48 h after the start of dosing. Chips were 
equilibrated for 48 h prior to dosing to ensure stable metabolic 
function.
2.2   |   Experimental Design
The liver chip experiment encompassed an ETI exposure range 
of 1× to 100× unbound plasma C max ETI to assess ETI-  induced 
drug- induced liver injury (DILI) and evaluate mitigation 
strategies. Chips were assigned to the following groups: 0.1% 
DMSO (Sigma-  Aldrich, Cat. # D2650) (negative control), 1×, 
10×, 30×, and 100× unbound plasma C max ETI, 100× plasma 
Cmax ETI + 10× plasma Cmax silymarin (Sigma-  Aldrich, Cat. 
# S0417-  1G) (experimental therapeutic), and 100× unbound 
plasma Cmax trovafloxacin (MedChemExpress, Cat. # HY- 
103399) (positive control). ETI compounds were sourced from 
AChemblock (elexacaftor, Cat. # U102941; tezacaftor, Cat. # 
G- 6563; ivacaftor, Cat. # 10237).
The experiment was performed in 2 cycles, with each cycle 
utilizing 12 chips divided into four experimental groups ( n = 3 
chips per group), dosed daily for 7 days via the top and bottom 
channel inlets. The first cycle included 0.1% DMSO, 1× C max 
ETI, 10× C max ETI, and 100× trovafloxacin, while the second 
cycle included 30× Cmax ETI, 100× Cmax ETI, 100× Cmax ETI + si-
lymarin, and trovafloxacin. Dosing solutions were prepared in 
hepatocyte maintenance medium with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO).
Dosing was performed daily by replacing the top and bottom 
channel medium with fresh medium containing the respec -
tive compounds. Chips were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 
throughout the 7- day dosing period.
2.3   |   Biochemical Assays
Top channel outlet effluent was collected daily (2.4 mL per chip) 
to quantify biomarkers of liver function and injury. Prior to each 
assay, frozen ( −80°C) effluent samples were thawed overnight 
at 4°C. Effluent samples were analyzed for alanine aminotrans -
ferase (ALT) and albumin levels using sandwich ELISA kits 
(Abcam, ALT ab234578, albumin ab179887) following vendor 
protocols. Effluent samples were analyzed to quantify urea and 
glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) levels using a colorimetric 
urea assay kit (Abcam, ab83362) and colorimetric kinetic assay 
kit (BioAssay Systems, DGLDH- 100), respectively, following the 
vendor protocols.
2.4   |   Morphological Analysis
Hepatocyte and NPC morphology were assessed on days 1, 
3, 5, and 7 using brightfield microscopy. Images were cap -
tured with a Keyence BZ-  X800 microscope (Keyence, Osaka, 
Japan) at 10× magnification, and were analyzed for cellular 
features, including cell viability, nuclear integrity, and cyto -
plasmic vacuolation. Images were scored based on the severity 
of cell debris agglomeration from zero (least severe) to four 
(most severe) according to the scoring matrix provided by 
Ewart et al. [ 23].
3   |   Results
3.1   |   Liver Biomarker Assays
ALT levels were not elevated at 1× and 10× Cmax ETI over the 
7- day period, with levels at or near that of the negative control, 
DMSO, and much lower than that of the positive control, tro -
vafloxacin (Figure  1A). However, ALT levels were significantly 
elevated in the 100× C max ETI and 100× C max ETI + silymarin 
treatment groups compared to trovafloxacin, peaking at Day 2–3 
and declining afterward (Figure  1A). Aside from an increase on 
Day 7, ALT levels for 30× Cmax ETI were much lower than that of 
both 100× Cmax ETI and 100× Cmax ETI + silymarin and within 
the range that of 1× and 10× ETI and DMSO (Figure  1A,B). 
ALT levels in the 100× trovafloxacin group reached a peak of 
0.07–0.08  μg/day/106 hepatocytes at Day 4 and slowly declined 
afterward (Figure 1A ).
Albumin levels for 1× and 10× C max ETI stayed relatively con -
stant near the levels of the negative control (DMSO), while al -
bumin levels for trovafloxacin decreased steadily over time 
(Figure  1B). Albumin levels in the 100× C max ETI and 100× 
Cmax ETI + Silymarin ETI groups rapidly declined over the first 
2 days until reaching undetectable levels from Day 3 onward 
(Figure  1B). In contrast, 30× C max ETI recorded the highest 
overall albumin levels but exhibited a slow but shallow decline 
in albumin levels over time (Figure 1B ).

 Clinical and Translational Science, 2025
The urea levels for 1× and 10× C max ETI, trovafloxacin, and 
DMSO remained steady within the range of 1000–2000 μg/
day/106 hepatocytes (Figure  1C). The 100× Cmax ETI and 100× 
Cmax ETI + silymarin groups yielded notable elevations in 
urea compared to trovafloxacin and other groups, peaking at 
2700 μg/day/106 hepatocytes on Day 3 and declining afterward 
(Figure  1C). Urea levels for 30× Cmax ETI were consistently 
lower than those of trovafloxacin and other experimental groups 
throughout the 7- day period (Figure 1C).
GLDH levels for all treatment groups across both experiments 
largely stayed within or slightly exceeded the normal reference 
range of 3–10 U/L by less than twofold (Figure  1D). Five of 56 
measurements fell below the limit of quantification (0.4 U/L) 
and were set to the lower limit of quantification in the analy -
sis. To evaluate the relative GLDH levels between treatment 
groups for the 7-  day dosing period, the area under the curve 
(AUC) for GLDH was calculated using the trapezoidal method 
in GraphPad Prism (Dotmatics, Boston, MA). The GLDH AUC 
of DMSO, 1× C max ETI, and 10× C max ETI fell within a narrow 
range of 39.87–41.30 days * U/L, while the GLDH AUC of trova -
floxacin was greater at 48.05 days * U/L (Figure  2). The GLDH 
AUC of 30× and 100× Cmax ETI was the highest at 51.61 days * 
U/L and 55.18 days * U/L, respectively, while the GLDH AUC of 
100× Cmax ETI + silymarin was the lowest at 31.81 days * U/L 
(Figure  2). No significant differences between groups were de -
tected by a one- way ANOVA with multiple comparison tests.
3.2   |   Hepatocyte and NPC Morphology
1×, 10×, and 30× Cmax ETI showed minor damage to hepatocytes 
and NPCs, with average morphology scores of less than 2 across 
7 days (Figure 3A,B). DMSO showed little to no cellular damage to 
hepatocytes and NPCs throughout the experiment (Figure 3A,B). 
The 100× C max ETI and 100× C max ETI + silymarin groups 
exhibited increasing signs of hepatocyte agglomeration and cell 
debris over time, which became more pronounced at Day 5–7 for 
hepatocytes and Days 3–7 for NPCs. At Day 7, these groups showed 
severe morphological damage, with extensive aggregation of cell 
debris and compromised cell viability, scoring 3–4 on the severity 
scale. Compared to the 100× Cmax ETI and 100× C max ETI + sily-
marin groups, 100× Cmax trovafloxacin exhibited a similar rise in

morphological damage to hepatocytes and a slower rise in damage 
to NPCs, but still yielded extensive hepatocyte agglomeration and 
NPC death by Day 7. Representative images for each experimental 
group at Days 1 and 7 are shown in Figure S1.
4   |   Discussion
4.1   |   Biomarkers of ETI- Mediated DILI
ALT was a clear biomarker for ETI-  mediated DILI, as the peak 
ALT levels for 100× Cmax ETI and 100× Cmax ETI + silymarin sur-
passed that of the positive control, trovafloxacin, by greater than 5- 
fold. The dose–response relationship for ETI and ALT was similar 
to that of published data for trovafloxacin, which showed major 
increases in ALT at 100× Cmax that were 10-  to 20- fold greater than 
that of 1× to 30× Cmax [23]. Reduction of albumin levels (indicative 
of a loss of liver synthetic function) in 100× Cmax ETI ± silymarin 
also clearly reflected ETI toxicity, as there was a rapid decrease in 
albumin until undetectable levels at Day 3, a much greater decline 
than that of trovafloxacin. An increase in urea for 100× Cmax ETI 
± silymarin peaking at Day 3, possibly due to the release of urea 
from dying hepatocytes, appeared to be a biomarker for ETI DILI 
as well. The day of peak urea levels for 100× C max ETI and 100× 
Cmax ETI + silymarin coincided with the day of peak ALT levels 
and the day on which albumin declined to undetectable levels.
The severity of changes in ALT, albumin, and urea corresponded 
to the intensity of morphology score increases for the treatment 
groups, verifying that the biomarker levels were signals of actual 
liver toxicity. For example, the steep rise in ALT and urea for 100× 
Cmax ETI ± silymarin as well as a drop in albumin from Day 1 
to Day 3 coincided with the rapid increase in morphology scores 
during that same time period. Meanwhile, the ALT, urea, and al-
bumin levels for 1×, 10×, and 30× Cmax ETI changed much less 
dramatically over the course of the experiment, mirroring the 
mild and slow increase in morphology scores for the same groups. 
Taken together, the biomarker and morphology score data show 
that the lower doses of ETI resulted in minimal damage to the 
cells in the liver chip compared to the highest dose, supporting the 
therapeutic strategy of dose reduction for ETI DILI.
GLDH did not appear to be a predictive biomarker for ETI- 
mediated DILI, as its levels remained near the reference range 
for all ETI concentrations tested throughout the 7-  day period. 
Analysis of the AUC of GLDH did reveal differences roughly 
matching the toxicity of treatment groups; however, the lack of 
statistically significant pairwise differences in AUC as deter -
mined by ANOVA and the absence of major GLDH elevations 
above the upper limit of normal suggest that GLDH may be a 
less sensitive translational biomarker when compared with ALT, 
albumin, or urea for detecting ETI- mediated DILI in the clinical 
setting.
A previous liver chip study found that elevations in GLDH were 
associated with elevations in ALT and AST for the hepatotoxic 
compound, JNJ- 3 [22]. Unlike ETI, an approved drug, JNJ- 3 was 
discontinued in preclinical development due to hepatocellular 
necrosis, portal fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia [ 22]. This sug -
gests that GLDH elevations may be drug- specific and dependent 
on the type and severity of damage to the liver, which may ex -
plain the differences in GLDH levels between JNJ-  3 and ETI.
4.2   |   Therapeutic Strategies: Dose Reduction 
and Silymarin
Silymarin did not have a significant observable impact on re -
ducing the toxicity of ETI, as the results for ALT, albumin, urea, 
and morphology scores were very similar between the 100× 
Cmax ETI and 100× C max ETI + Silymarin groups. It is possible 
that the dose of silymarin used, 10× plasma C max, was not high 
enough to counteract the reactive oxygen species generated by 
100× Cmax ETI. Alternatively, a secondary mechanism for ETI- 
mediated DILI, such as mitochondrial dysfunction due to elec -
tron transport chain inhibition, may have contributed to toxicity.
Unlike silymarin, reduced doses of ETI from 30× plasma C max 
and lower did show significantly lower levels of ALT, higher al -
bumin levels, and more moderate urea levels than 100× C max 
ETI, suggesting that ETI dose reduction may be an effective 
therapeutic strategy for mitigating ETI-  mediated DILI.
4.3   |   Implications for Clinical Practice
In response to growing evidence of DILI due to ETI in post- 
marketing reports, the FDA-  approved labeling of ETI has 
recently been updated (December 2024) to include revised moni-
toring (earlier and more frequent measurement) of liver function 
FIGURE 3     |    Morphology scores for the hepatocyte channel (A) and NPC channel (B). Higher scores indicate greater cell death and more severe 
agglomeration of cell debris. Error bars represent standard deviation.

tests (e.g., ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) and 
guidance on treatment interruption for significant elevations 
until the abnormalities resolve. Data from the liver-  on- chip ex-
periments in this investigation reinforce that traditional liver 
function tests such as ALT are reliable as biomarkers for ETI- 
mediated DILI. In addition, significant reductions in albumin 
and spikes in levels of urea corresponding to peak ALT levels 
may provide additional means of detecting liver injury. GLDH 
showed minor but observable differences in toxicity of treatment 
groups but does not surpass ALT, as there were no elevations of 
GLDH significantly above the upper limit of normal.
While use of antioxidants to prevent DILI is actively being in -
vestigated, data from our liver-  on- chip experiments did not 
demonstrate a therapeutic effect of silymarin in mitigating ETI- 
induced DILI. Additional studies evaluating other potential an -
tioxidants are warranted.
Dose reduction is a highly promising therapeutic strategy for 
ETI- mediated DILI, as evidenced by the reduced ALT levels of 
30× Cmax ETI compared to that of 100× Cmax ETI. This liver chip 
data corroborates findings from a previous clinical cohort study 
by our group, which demonstrated that ETI dose reduction re -
sulted in the resolution or improvement of adverse effects (ALT 
elevation, mental health disruptions) in 13 out of 15 patients 
[25]. Future studies for ETI dose reduction can be conducted in 
a larger population to confirm these findings.
4.4   |   Limitations and Future Directions
While this study provides valuable insights into the biomarkers 
of ETI DILI and potential therapeutic strategies, there are sev -
eral limitations that should be considered. The liver- on- chip sys-
tem offers a highly relevant model of human liver function, but it 
does not fully replicate the complexity of human physiology, in -
cluding the influence of factors such as genetic variation, comor-
bidities, or concurrent drug use. These factors may be accounted 
for in future liver chip studies by pooling cell stocks from multi -
ple donors, and by testing ETI with other medications for cystic 
fibrosis to determine the impact of drug interactions on DILI 
biomarkers. In addition, because the liver chip only allows for a 
short experimental window of up to 7 days, the long- term effects 
of both ETI and therapeutic interventions like dose reduction 
and silymarin should be investigated in a clinical setting to as -
sess potential chronic toxicity or efficacy over extended periods 
of treatment. In addition, the hepatotoxic effects of some drugs 
have been shown to be augmented in the presence of inflam -
mation. In particular, Rubiano et  al. (2021) found that trova -
floxacin induced higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
indicative of tissue damage, in liver chips co-  dosed with LPS 
compared to those not dosed with LPS [26]. Future experiments 
could be conducted in the liver chip assessing the effect of ETI 
and LPS coadministration on biomarker levels to investigate the 
contribution of inflammation to ETI hepatotoxicity.
5   |   Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that the human liver chip model can 
be used to evaluate potential novel biomarkers of ETI-  mediated 
DILI and therapeutic strategies for mitigating this risk. GLDH 
may not offer benefits over traditional liver function tests such 
as ALT, but dose reduction was shown to be a promising ap -
proach for reducing ETI-  induced liver injury and may inform 
future clinical practices in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
Further studies are needed to explore additional emerging DILI 
biomarkers and optimize antioxidant therapeutic strategies for 
improving the safety profile of ETI in clinical settings.
