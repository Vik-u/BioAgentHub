ABSTRACT: The ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) from the fungus Penicillium
digitatum strain Pd1 was heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and its
properties were compared to the extensively characterized bacterial enzyme from
Pseudomonas savastanoi strain PK2. Both enzymes catalyze four reactions: the
conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to ethylene and CO
2
, oxidative decarbox-
ylation of 2OG coupled to L -arginine ( L -Arg) hydroxylation, uncoupled oxidative
decarboxylation of 2OG, and the production of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) from
2OG. The strain Pd1 enzyme exhibited a greater ratio of ethylene production over
L -Arg hydroxylation than the PK2 strain EFE. The uncoupled decarboxylation of
2OG and 3-HP production are minor reactions in both cases, but they occur to a
greater extent using the fungal enzyme. Additional distinctions of the fungal versus bacterial enzyme are noted in the absorbance
maxima and L -Arg dependence of their anaerobic electronic spectra. The structures of the Pd1 EFE apoprotein and the EFE·Mn(II)·
2OG complex resembled the corresponding structures of the PK2 enzyme, but notable structural differences were observed in the
computationally predicted Pd1 EFE·Fe(II)·2OG· L -Arg complex versus the PK2 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG· L -Arg crystal structure. These
studies extend our biochemical understanding and represent the first structural and conformational characterization of a eukaryotic
EFE.

INTRODUCTION
Ethylene serves as a building block for the synthesis of several
plastics and other organic products as well as being promoted
as a transportation fuel.
1,2
Commercial production of this gas
currently involves steam cracking of fossil fuels and is the
largest CO
2
-emitting process in the chemical industry.
3,4
Therefore, there is great interest in developing alternative
technology for ethylene production in a more sustainable
manner using renewable sources.
5−7
Ethylene is naturally
produced in plants and by several enzymes in microorganisms.
8
Of particular interest here is the microbial ethylene-forming
enzyme (EFE), which uses 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and arginine
( L -Arg) as substrates.
EFE likely catalyzes four reactions as shown in Figure 1.
Most notably, EFE uniquely converts 2OG to ethylene and
CO
2
(reaction A), but does so only in the presence of L -Arg.
9
In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation
of 2OG to produce succinate and CO
2
coupled to the
hydroxylation of L -Arg at C5 (reaction B).
10
This trans-
formation corresponds to a canonical type of reaction observed
in the Fe(II)/2OG-dependent oxygenase superfamily.
11
The
hydroxy-arginine intermediate spontaneously decays to form
guanidine and L -Δ
1
-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). Although
not yet reported, EFE also likely catalyzes the uncoupled
decarboxylation of 2OG to produce succinate and CO
2
(reaction C); this reaction is widely observed in the Fe(II)/
2OG oxygenases.
12
Finally, in the presence of L -Arg, EFE
produces trace amounts of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP)
(reaction D),
13,14
a precursor of a biodegradable plastic and
an industrial polymer. The relative rates for the major reactions
A and B, initially reported to be 2,
10
is referred to as the
partition ratio.
Most biochemical studies and all structural studies have thus
far been performed with EFE from Pseudomonas savastanoi
(formerly P. syringae) pv phaseolicola strain PK2, henceforth
termed PK2 EFE.
10,15−18
For example, the PK2 enzyme was
used to demonstrate that L -Arg binding leads to significant
conformational changes at the active site that facilitate ethylene
formation.
16
Mechanistic experiments and computational
analyses of the ethylene-forming and L -Arg hydroxylation
reactions also have centered on this enzyme and are well
advanced.
13,14,19−24
Other bacterial EFEs from Microcoleus
asticus, Myxococus stipitatus DSM 14675, Ralstonia solanacea-
rum, Scytonema sp. NIES-4073, and Nostoc sp. ATCC 43529
have been purified and their kinetics of ethylene formation

were characterized.
25
In contrast, EFEs from fungal sources are
relatively underexplored. The enzyme was purified from
Penicillium digitatum strain IFO 9372 and some properties
were characterized; e.g., the enzyme’s activity was stated to
require 2OG, L -Arg, ferrous ions, dithiothreitol, and oxy-
gen.
26,27
Subsequently, the genome sequence was determined
for strain Pd1 of this necrotrophic fungus,
28
which causes the
common citrus postharvest disease known as green mold.
In this study, we describe the purification and extensive
characterization of a mitochondrial targeting sequence-
removed version of EFE from P. digitatum strain Pd1 (denoted
Pd1 EFE) that closely corresponds to the form present in the
fungus. The genome-encoded protein has an extended N-
terminal sequence compared to PK2 (Figure S1); however,
this extension is removed during organellar processing to the
mitochondria.
29
The overall sequence identity between the
processed Pd1 and PK2 is ∼55% (188/345 residues). We
compared several properties of the truncated Pd1 and PK2
versions of EFE, revealing overall similarities and several
notable distinctions. Using anaerobic UV−visible spectrosco-
py, we reveal that the Pd1 protein exhibits changes in
absorption maxima and L -Arg dependence from what was
reported for PK2 EFE. We demonstrate that both versions of
EFE carry out reaction C, as anticipated, with the Pd1 enzyme
having twice the amount of uncoupled reaction as PK2 EFE.
Furthermore, we establish that Pd1 EFE has a greater partition
ratio (when measured as ethylene/P5C, reflecting the amount
of reaction A divided by the extent of reaction B) than
observed with the PK2 EFE, which has a ratio that is greater
than previously reported.
10
Using a mass spectrometry
method, we show that Pd1 EFE produces more 3-HP
(reflecting reaction D) than is detected for PK2 EFE. We
obtained the crystal structure of Pd1 EFE apoprotein and its
Mn(II)·2OG complex and show their overall structural
similarity with the structures of PK2 EFE. We used
computational methods to predict the structure of the Pd1
EFE·Fe(II)·2OG· L -Arg complex and to identify the O
2
access
tunnel. In combination, the structures and calculations
reported here provide keen insights into the basis for the
distinct properties of this fungal enzyme, the first characterized
eukaryotic EFE, relative to its bacterial counterparts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. 4-Bromo-N-methylbenzylamine (4-BNMA),
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), L -Arg, sodium phos-
phate monobasic, and imidazole were acquired from Sigma (St.
Louis, Missouri). Kanamycin, isopropyl β- D -1-thiogalactopyr-
anoside (IPTG), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesul-
fonic acid (HEPES), and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-
NTA) agarose beads were purchased from GoldBio (St.
Louis, Missouri). 2OG was from Fluka, EDTA was from
Invitrogen, 3-HP (sodium salt) was from Cayman Chemical,
and all other chemicals were of reagent grade or better.
Plasmid Construction. Using the P. digitatum strain Pd1
genome,
28
we had synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc.) a codon-optimized version of the gene that directly
connects the four predicted exons encoding EFE preceded by a
His
6
tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site
(Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-*-Ser, with * denoting the cleav-
age point) for expression in Escherichia coli. This construct
yielded mainly insoluble protein because the initially predicted
start codon had been mis-identified and the protein was
missing its first 49 residues, some of which are removed during
organellar targeting in the fungus.
29
The initial construct was
modified to provide a soluble TEV-cleaved protein that started
with Ser from the TEV cleavage site, a His-Met linker, followed
by Leu37 and the remainder of EFE using the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) with Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase
(New England Bio Laboratories) and the following primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.): forward, 5′-GCCGTA-
GAATTCTTGACGACTACTACAGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-
CGGCATGGATCCTGAAAGTAGGCGAAAGC-3′. The
PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction
enzymes, and the fragment was ligated into a modified
pET28a(+) vector (carrying kanamycin resistance) with
codons for an N-terminal His
6
tag and a TEV cleavage site.
After the plasmid sequence was verified at the RTSF Genomics
Core of Michigan State University, it was transformed into E.
coli BL21 Gold (DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies). Using
Vazyme Clone Express kit C112, mutagenesis of this plasmid
was performed to generate a construct encoding the N380C
variant form of Pd1 EFE.
Enzyme Purification. Unless otherwise noted, all buffers
were prepared at room temperature with the pH adjusted using
either NaOH or HCl. Terrific broth medium supplemented
with 50 μg/mL kanamycin (1 L in 2.8 L Fernbach flasks) was
inoculated (1%) with a fresh culture and grown overnight at 37
°C with shaking at 225 rpm until reaching an OD
600
of 0.8−
1.2. The temperature of the culture was lowered to 20 °C, the
cells were induced with IPTG (final concentration of 0.2 mM),

and growth continued overnight. The next day, the culture was
harvested by centrifugation at 7000g and 4 °C for 15−20 min.
The cells were stored at −80 °C until further use. The same
culture method was used for production of the N380C variant
of Pd1 EFE. The cells producing the variant enzyme grew
more slowly than those synthesizing the nonvariant EFE.
The cell pellets were thawed, resuspended in buffer A [50
mM NaH
2
PO
4
(pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM
imidazole], and supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsul-
fonyl fluoride (from a 100 mM stock in 100% ethanol) and 1
U/mL Benzonase (EMD Millipore). The cell suspensions were
lysed by using a French pressure cell at 16,000 psi at 4 °C.
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (45 min at 100,000g)
at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were applied to a Ni-NTA agarose
column, unbound proteins were eluted with 10 column
volumes of buffer A, and the protein of interest was eluted
with ∼5−10 column volumes of buffer B (buffer A with 300
mM imidazole).
The Ni-NTA fractions containing the desired Pd1 EFE
protein were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged for
50 mM NaH
2
PO
4
(pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl and 10
mM imidazole by using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff
Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (EMD Millipore). The
His
6
tag was removed by incubation with His
7
-TEV238Δ
protease
30
for 16−18 h at 4 °C, and the EFE/TEV protease
mixture was applied to the Ni-NTA column that had been
equilibrated with buffer A. The flow-through fractions and
∼7−10 column volumes of buffer A wash were collected,
concentrated to 2.5 mL, and buffer exchanged into 25 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) using a PD-10 column (Cytiva). Prior to
performing any assays, EDTA was removed from the protein of
interest using a PD-10 column. For long-term storage, the
eluted fractions were concentrated, glycerol was added to a
final concentration of 5%, the samples were flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and the enzyme was placed at −80 °C until
further use. For comparative studies, we purified the strain PK2
EFE and its A198V variant
16
using a previously described
protocol.
15
The homogeneity of the EFE samples was assessed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE).
31
To more accurately determine the subunit
size of Pd1 EFE, protein samples (10 μM) were injected onto a
cyano-chemistry HPLC column that was equilibrated in 0.1%
formic acid and eluted with an increasing gradient of
acetonitrile. The fractions were analyzed by electrospray
ionization-mass spectrometer (ESI-MS) using a XEVO G2-
XS instrument in positive ionization mode. The protein masses
were derived from the MS data using MaxEnt1 (Waters
Corp).
32
The mass of the native enzyme was estimated by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 Increase
10/300 GL (Cytiva) column equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES,
pH 8.0, containing 1 mM TCEP. The SEC fractions with
significant 280 nm absorbance were analyzed by injecting (8
μL) into the ESI-MS to determine the subunit size.
Metal Analysis. PK2 and Pd1 versions of EFE were
purified as described above and, after removing the His
6
tag
with TEV protease, they were (1) maintained in 50 mM
NaH
2
PO
4
(pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl buffer, (2) exchanged
into 25 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) buffer, or (3) exchanged into 25
mM HEPES (pH 8.0) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 1
mM DTT followed by EDTA removal using a PD-10 column.
The concentrations of Pd1 EFE for the three conditions were
812, 997, and 950 μM, and those of PK2 EFE were 2900,
3109, and 2433 μM, respectively. EFE samples (25−150 μL)
were mixed with 100 μL of 70% nitric acid and digested for 1 h
at 100 °C, diluted to 5 mL with water, and examined using an
Agilent 8900 Triple Quadrupole ICP-MS at the MSU
Quantitative Bio Element Analysis and Mapping (QBEAM)
Center to determine the metal contents.
Anaerobic UV−Visible Spectroscopy. Stock solutions
(100 mM) of 2OG and L -Arg were prepared in 25 mM HEPES
buffer (pH adjusted to 7.5) in serum vials sealed with butyl
rubber stoppers and made anaerobic by several rounds of
vacuum degassing and flushing with argon via a vacuum
manifold. After degassing, sodium dithionite was added to a
final concentration of 2 mM from a 100 mM stock solution.
Ferrous ammonium sulfate stock solutions (100 mM) were
prepared by several rounds of degassing and flushing with
argon inside a sealed serum vial. The Fe(NH
4
)
2
(SO
4
)
2
salt was
dissolved in the desired volume of 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH
7.5) containing 2 mM sodium dithionite. The Pd1 EFE sample
was made anaerobic by multiple rounds of gentle degassing
and flushing with argon on ice, then adjusted to contain 2 mM
sodium dithionite. All equilibrium spectroscopy studies used a
1 cm path length, 2 mL quartz cuvette fitted with a stopper and
purged with argon. Samples of Pd1 EFE [0.37 mM subunit in
25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5)] were transferred into the
cuvette using a gastight syringe (Hamilton) that had been
flushed with 2 mM dithionite buffer. Difference spectra were
recorded for Pd1 EFE samples to which anaerobic aliquots (10
μL) of Fe(NH
4
)
2
(SO
4
)
2
, 2OG, and L -Arg had been added,
blanking against the enzyme and dithionite mixture.
Enzyme Assays. Enzyme assays were performed at room
temperature (22 ± 1 °C) unless noted otherwise in 10 mm ×
16 mm tubes (BD Vacutainer Serum). Aliquots of EFE (using
varied amounts as noted in the text or figure legends) were
incubated in 2 mL of 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5)
containing the indicated concentrations of 2OG, L -Arg,
Fe(NH
4
)
2
(SO

)
2
, and L -ascorbic acid. The reactions were
vortexed and then terminated at designated time points by
adding 0.1 mL of 3.6 M HCl unless mentioned otherwise.
Ethylene formation was measured by withdrawing 0.25 mL of
the headspace with a Hamilton gastight syringe and injecting it
into a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a
flame ionization detector and a Porapak N-packed column
(80/100 mesh, 2 m × 1/8 inch). The instrument was
calibrated using known concentrations of ethylene (SCOTTY
Analyzed Gases, 99.5%).
The concentrations of P5C were determined by either of
two approaches. In one case, an aliquot (1 mL) of the reaction
solution was mixed with 0.2 mL of 10 mM 2-amino-
benzaldehyde in 40% ethanol, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min
to develop the yellow adduct, and the absorbance was
measured at 440 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 2.58
mM
−1
cm
−1
.
33
Alternatively, the reactions were terminated
with 0.1 mL of 3.6 M HCl, and 1 mL samples were derivatized
by adding 0.2 mL of 2% ninhydrin in water. The mixtures were
heated to 100 °C for ∼30 min, cooled, and centrifuged at
3234g for 15−30 min at 4 °C. After decanting the supernatant,
the reddish-brown sediment was resuspended in ethanol (0.5
mL), vortexed to extract the P5C-ninhydrin chromogen (a
pinkish color), and transformed to a bluish color by adding 0.5
mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Following
centrifugation at 2500g for 10 min, the absorbance at 620
nm was measured and the concentration of P5C was calculated

for the P5C−ninhydrin adduct.
34
Succinate and 2OG concentrations
35
were determined in
samples and standards that were heat treated (60 °C for 15−20
min) using a Waters TQ-S triple quadrupole MS/MS
controlled by MassLynx 4.2 software (Waters, Milford, MA).
MS/MS data were evaluated with TargetLynx 4.2 software
(Waters). The autosampler injected 5 μL of sample from a
compartment maintained at 10 °C. The chromatographic
separation of the analyte was performed at 50 °C on a Waters
Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 × 50 mm) analytical column using 10
mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid in 97% water and
3% methanol (MS grade) for eluent A and methanol (MS
grade) for eluent B. Gradient elution at a flow of 0.3 mL/min
was performed by changing % B as follows: 0.0−1.0 min: 10%;
1.0−3.0 min: 10 to 20%; 3.0−6.0 min: 20 to 65%; 6.0−6.5
min: 65 to 95%; 6.5−8.0 min: 95%, 8.01- 10.0 min: 10%. All
analytes were measured in negative electrospray ion mode
using dwell times of 44 ms. Optimized MS/MS settings are
summarized in Table S1. The concentrations of analytes were
determined by comparison to standard curves. Notably, this
assay for succinate is distinct from the HPLC method with
detection by absorbance or refractive index as used
previously.
15
Quantification of the amount of 2OG that was consumed
during the reaction utilized an o-phenylenediamine (OPDA)
assay. Aliquots (250 μL) of reaction mixtures were incubated
for selected time periods, quenched by the addition of 1 mL
0.5 mg/mL OPDA (Sigma-Aldrich) stock solution (dissolved
in 1 M phosphoric acid, pH 2, containing 0.25% (v/v) β-
mercaptoethanol), and the samples were heated for 3 min at
100 °C. The absorbance at 333 nm was monitored to
determine 2OG consumption by comparison to standard
curves.
The production of 3-HP
36
was quantified in reaction
mixtures and standards (100 μL) that were quenched with
three volumes of acetonitrile or by adding 50 μL of methanol
and 100 μL of dried pyridine. The samples were shaken in a
rocker for 20 min followed by addition and mixing of 30 μL 1-
ethyl-3-(3-dimethyaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) solution
(13.6 mg mL
−1
) in methanol-dried pyridine (20:80 v/v) and
50 μL of 4-BNMA solution (4.8 mM in dried pyridine). The
tubes were maintained at 72 °C for 45 min or until the organic
solvents evaporated, then the samples were dried at 72 °C
under a stream of N
2
. The samples were dissolved in 150 μL of
a solution containing 2 parts of 0.1% formic acid in water and
one part of acetonitrile along with 350 μL of ethyl acetate.
After mixing in a rocker for 20 min, the samples were
centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min and the supernatants were
transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. After drying under a
stream of N
2
, the samples were reconstituted into 100 μL of
water containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol (1:1 v/v).
The analyte was analyzed by ESI-MS using a XEVO G2-XS
instrument in positive ionization mode. MassLynx 4.2 software
(Waters, Milford, MA) was used for data acquisition and
analysis. The autosampler injected 10 μL of sample maintained
at a compartment temperature of 10 °C. Analytes were
injected onto a Waters Acquity premier BEH C18 (2.1 mm ×
100 mm) column that was equilibrated in 10 mM ammonium
formate in water, pH 2.8, at 40 °C and eluted with an
increasing gradient of acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.
The total run time per injection was 10 min. The analyte
retention time and m/z of selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
transitions are shown in Table S2 with examples of the
derivatized structures for 3-HP, succinic acid, and 2-OG.
To obtain the kinetic constants for the EFE-catalyzed
reactions of 2OG and L -Arg, the enzyme samples (125−200
nM EFE in 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) were added to 2
mL assay mixtures containing 0.2 mM Fe(NH
4
)
2
(SO
4
)
2
, 0.4
mM L -ascorbic acid, and varying the concentrations of either
2OG or L -Arg; i.e., the concentration of one substrate was kept
constant at 500 μM while varying the concentration of the
other substrate (0−700 μM). The reactions were terminated at
designated time points and products were quantified as
described above. The initial velocity data were fitted by
nonlinear regression analysis using the Michaelis−Menten
equation in Origin 8.0.
Crystallization and Data Analysis. For crystallization,
TEV-cleaved Pd1 EFE was further purified by SEC using a
Superdex HiLoad 16/600 75 prep grade column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). The column was equilibrated with
25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM
TCEP. The Pd1 EFE was concentrated and buffer exchanged
into 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 mM
TCEP, and concentrated to ∼40 mg/mL using an Amicon
ultracentrifugation unit (molecular-weight cutoff 10,000 Da).
Crystallization was performed in 96 well plates by the sitting
drop vapor diffusion technique and using the mosquito
crystallization robot (TTP Labtech). Initial crystallization
conditions were explored using the Index HT (Hampton
Research), Crystal Screen HT (Hampton Research), Wizard
1&2 (Rigaku Reagents), and Wizard 3&4 (Rigaku Reagents).
Crystals grew in a single condition containing 10% PEG 8000,
100 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0), and 200 mM calcium
acetate at 4 °C. The crystals of Pd1 EFE apoprotein were
retrieved using a nylon loop and soaked overnight in reservoir
solution supplemented with 1 mM MnCl
2
and 2OG. Crystals
were soaked in 25% ethylene glycol and 75% reservoir solution
(containing MnCl
2
and 2OG as applicable) before flash
freezing in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced
Photon Source LS-CAT beamline 21-ID-D. For details, see
Table S3. Data sets were indexed and integrated with
iMosflm
37
and merging and scaling were done using Aimless.
38
Molecular replacement and refinement were done in Phenix
39
with model building in COOT.
40
Initially, a model of Pd1 EFE
was created by AlphaFold
41
and used in molecular replacement
to solve the structure. Data sets were deposited to the protein
data bank (PDB) with IDs 9EIR and 9EIS. Structural features
are depicted using PyMOL software (Shro ̈ dinger).
System Preparation for Computational Analyses.
Starting with the coordinates for Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG
(chain A), the position of 2OG was reconfigured to that for
2OG in the PK2 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG· L -Arg structure (5V2Y),
the L -Arg conformation was obtained from the PK2 structure
by overlaying and was positioned to interact with Glu141,
Thr143 and Arg336, and Mn(II) was replaced by Fe(II). The
position trans to His251 was modified to dioxygen to obtain
the Fe(III)-superoxo structure. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were carried out at this Fe(III)·OO
•−
state for
rigorous comparison with the PK2 EFE dynamics published in
our earlier work.
19
Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein
residues using Amber routines according to their protonation
states. The parameters for nonstandard residues, including
2OG, L -Arg, and dioxygen, were obtained using a Generalized
Amber Force Field (GAFF)
42
implemented in an antechamber

module of Amber 20.
43
The metal center parameters were
obtained for the high spin Fe(III) (S = 2, and M = 5) state
coordinated to 2OG, dioxygen, His251, Asp253, and His327
using Metal Center Parameter Builder (MCPB v3.0).
44
The

force field was used to model the rest of the protein.
The system was then solvated and neutralized with Na

MD Simulations. The solvated system was minimized in
two steps�the first minimization involved a restraint of 100
kcal/mol on the solute molecule, and the second minimization
was carried out without any restraints. The minimization steps
involved 5000 steps of the steepest descent method and the
remaining 5000 steps of the conjugate gradient method. The
system was heated from 0 to 300 K as an NVT ensemble using
a Langevin thermostat with 1 ps
−1
collision frequency for 250
ps.
46
The solute molecules were restrained during heating with
a harmonic potential of 50 kcal/mol. After heating, the system
underwent a 1 ns simulation with a weak restraint on the solute
to achieve uniform density. Before equilibration, the system
underwent a 300 ns simulation with a small restraint between
the Fe and the C5 carbon of L -Arg to obtain a better
orientation of the L -Arg substrate. After the restraint dynamics,
equilibration was carried out for 3 ns at constant pressure.
Following equilibration, the production simulations were
carried out for 1 μs with a time step of 2 fs. The particle
mesh Ewald method
47
was used to compute long-range
interactions with a 10 Å cutoff. The simulations were
implemented in the GPU-accelerated version of Amber 20
(Amber-PMEMD).
43
Hydrogen bonding analyses were carried
out using the CPPTRAJ module of Amber 20.

Dynamic
Cross Correlation analysis (DCCA) and Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) were conducted on the Cα atoms of the
protein in the equilibrated portion of the MD trajectory using
the Bio3D module implemented in the R software package.
49
The potential dioxygen transport channels were manually
inspected from the equilibrated portion of the MD simulations
and characterized using CAVER 3.0.

The dioxygen was

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Purification and Initial Properties of PK2 and Pd1
EFEs. We overexpressed in E. coli a codon-optimized gene for
EFE from P. digitatum strain Pd1 that was preceded by a His
6
tag, a TEV cleavage site, and a His-Met linker, then starting at
Leu37 (i.e., missing its putative mitochondrial targeting signal,
which is unstructured according to the structural model
predicted by AlphaFold).
41
The His
6
-tagged protein was
synthesized in cells grown at 20 °C, purified by immobilized
metal affinity chromatography, treated with TEV protease to
cleave the tag, and then isolated by re-chromatography using
the affinity resin. Residues in this protein retain the numbering
of the nontruncated protein initially synthesized by the fungus.
The sample was treated with DTT and EDTA, providing
essentially homogeneous apoenzyme after removal of the
reductant and chelator as shown by SDS-PAGE (Figure S2A).
ESI-MS confirmed the presence of a species with m/z of
41,971 (Figure S2B), corresponding to the theoretical mass of
41,971 Da (calculated using https://web.expasy.org/
protparam/ with an input of Ser-His-Met and the truncated
EFE starting at Leu37 of UniprotKB entry A0A7T7BQH3).
The results from size exclusion chromatography demonstrated
that the apoprotein form of the native enzyme was monomeric
(Figure S2C,D), as was previously reported for the
holoenzyme from P. digitatum strain IFO 9372.
27
For
comparison, PK2 EFE was purified from recombinant E. coli
cells as previously described.
15
After purification by Ni-NTA chromatography, PK2 EFE
was blue in color, whereas Pd1 EFE was yellow (Figure
S3A,B). The visible spectrum of the PK2 enzyme exhibited a
broad peak with a maximal absorption at ∼620 nm, whereas
the Pd1 EFE spectrum had a gradually increasing absorbance
with decreasing wavelength (Figure S3C). After cleavage of
His
6
tags, the metal contents for each purified sample were
analyzed by ICP-MS (Table S4). Whereas PK2 EFE possessed
0.85 or 0.86 Ni/subunit in phosphate or HEPES buffers, the
Pd1 EFE contained only 0.32 or 0.23 Ni/subunit for these
conditions, and both proteins had <0.06 Fe/subunit. We
attribute the blue color of PK2 EFE to d-d electronic
transitions associated with the near stoichiometric amounts
of Ni bound to the protein by nitrogen-containing ligands,
whereas the yellow color of Pd1 EFE results from the low
levels of Ni, which could possibly bind in a distinct manner,
and small amounts of bound ferric ions. After treatment with 1
mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA (in HEPES buffer at pH 8.0) the
colors disappeared, and the metal contents dropped to 0.026
and 0.015 Ni/subunit for both the PK2 and Pd1 proteins. All
subsequent studies utilized the apoproteins of PK2 and Pd1
EFEs after removal of the thiol and chelator.
Anaerobic Difference Spectra. UV−visible difference
spectroscopy was used to investigate the binding of Fe(II) and
2OG to Pd1 EFE under anaerobic conditions (Figure 2). The
addition of 2OG to an anaerobic solution of Pd1 EFE
containing Fe(II) gave rise to three electronic transitions with
λ
max
∼ 565 nm, ∼ 600 nm, and ∼670 nm corresponding to
extinction coefficients of ∼151, 165, 90 M

contained 362 μM Pd1 EFE, 1 mM sodium dithionite, 1 mM ferrous
ammonium sulfate, 1 mM 2OG, and (when present) 1 mM L -Arg. All
the components were present in 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. The
pH of L -Arg and 2OG solutions were adjusted to 7.5 before degassing.

what was reported previously for the PK2 enzyme.

case, the three transitions were indistinct, and the 2OG-
induced difference spectrum had a single λ

an extinction coefficient of ∼114 M

addition of L -Arg led to a slight shift in λ

to ∼510 nm along
with a dramatic increase in extinction coefficient to 314 M

. The PK2 EFE results were interpreted in terms of
conformational changes in the crystal structures that showed
an initial mixture of monodentate and bidentate 2OG−metal
interactions shifting to exclusively bidentate binding upon the
binding of L -Arg.
16
The significant L -Arg dependence of the
spectral intensity was not present in the Pd1 EFE, suggesting
an alternative binding mode of L -Arg in the fungal protein.
Production of Ethylene, P5C, Succinate, and 3-HP by
Pd1 EFE. Pd1 EFE converted 2OG and L -Arg to ethylene,
succinate, and P5C (Figure 3A). The final concentration of
ethylene formation was approximately seven times the final
concentration of P5C, which is much greater than the partition
ratio of 2 initially reported for PK2 EFE.
10
Ethylene and P5C
were formed via reactions A and B of Figure 1. Succinate also
is produced by reaction B, but it is formed in greater amounts
than P5C consistent with some uncoupled 2OG oxidation via
reaction C. We directly demonstrated that such an uncoupled
reaction occurs in both Pd1 and PK2 versions of EFE by
monitoring succinate production in the absence of L -Arg
(Figure 3B). Pd1 EFE generated more than twice the amount
of succinate than did PK2 EFE when the samples lacked L -Arg,
whereas the levels for nonenzymatic conversion of 2OG to
succinate were negligible. In the presence of L -Arg the
concentrations of P5C and succinate were comparable for
reactions using either the Pd1 or PK2 versions of EFE, even
when the temperature was varied from 25 to 37 °C or if the pH
was varied from 6.5 to 8.0 (Table S5). Small amounts of 3-HP
(reaction D in Figure 1) were produced by both versions of
EFE, with the Pd1 enzyme producing twice that of PK2 EFE
(Figure 3C).
We extended our analysis of 3-HP production by examining
the A198V variant of PK2 EFE. Other investigators had shown
that the A198L variant of PK2 EFE exhibits greatly reduced
production of ethylene while generating 0.435 3-HP per 2OG
consumed,
14
so we tested whether our previously described
A198V variant
16
also produces prodigious quantities of this
side product. Indeed, this variant of PK2 EFE converted most
2OG to 3-HP (Figure S4), while using a small amount of 2OG

Pd1 EFE Kinetics. The Pd1 enzyme exhibited Michaelis−
Menten kinetics when examining the production of ethylene or
the generation of P5C as a function of either 2OG or L -Arg
concentration (Figure S5). The calculated kinetic parameters
are shown in Table 1 using the ninhydrin assay for quantifying
P5C, with values for the PK2 enzyme also tabulated for
comparison. The ethylene production k
cat
values of Pd1 and
PK2 EFEs are very close to each other, whereas the
corresponding K
m
values of Pd1 EFE are several fold greater
than the former PK2 EFE values; thus, the catalytic efficiencies
of Pd1 EFE for ethylene generation using these two substrates
are 46 and 17% of the PK2 protein values.
15
Other
investigators reported the ethylene production kinetic
parameters for the PK2 EFE and five other purified bacterial
EFEs.

They reported values of 22−54 min

( L -Arg) using the bacterial enzymes, similar
to what we had reported for PK2 EFE. Overall, the kinetics
parameters of Pd1 EFE are similar to those for previously
characterized members of this enzyme family.
Comparison of the Partition Ratio for Pd1 and PK2
EFEs. Prior studies of the PK2 version of EFE reported
ethylene/succinate partition ratios ranging from 1 to
3,
10,14,18,21
suggesting that the value is reaction condition
dependent. Because succinate also may be produced by the
uncoupled oxidative decarboxylation of 2OG (Figure 1,
reaction C) as we demonstrated above, we chose to monitor
the partition ratio of the ethylene forming reaction versus the
L -Arg hydroxylation reaction by determining the ethylene/P5C
ratio. Indeed, the initially reported
10
ethylene/succinate ratio
of 2 likely underestimated the true partitioning between Figure
1 A/B as hinted by our earlier studies with the PK2 EFE
enzyme.
15
The results from Figure 3A for Pd1 EFE suggest
that this enzyme may have a significantly larger partition ratio.
To more accurately measure this value, we compared the
ethylene/P5C partition ratios for PK2 EFE and Pd1 EFE at the
same time and using identical conditions (Figure 4). The PK2
EFE exhibited a ratio of 3.8 ± 0.7, whereas the Pd1 EFE
provided a ratio of 6.6 ± 0.7.
Structure of a Fungal EFE. We obtained crystal structures
for the Pd1 EFE apoprotein and the enzyme complex with
both manganese and 2OG (Table S3). We illustrate a
representative electron density map for a portion of the
backbone and side chains (residues 64 to 87 of chain A) of the
Pd1 EFE apoprotein and provide an omit map of Mn(II) in
chain C (Figure S6). Mn(II) is a surrogate of Fe(II) that does
not react with oxygen; although the Mn-containing enzyme is
inactive, this substituted version has been used for obtaining
structures of many Fe(II)/2OG oxygenases including PK2
EFE.
16
An AlphaFold model
41
was used as a template for
molecular replacement to solve the Pd1 EFE apoprotein crystal
structure at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The Pd1 EFE crystals have a
different morphology but the same space group (P2
1
2
1
2
1
) as
the PK2 EFE.
16
Although Pd1 EFE is predominantly a
monomer in solution, the asymmetric unit contains four
molecules (chains A, B, C, and D) with the overall Cα RMSD
for the apoprotein structure ranging from 0.19 to 0.32 Å
(Table S6). We were unable to model several disordered
regions of the apoprotein (chain A, residues 140-144, 237-249,
274-295; chain B, residues 139-147, 237-251, 274-294; chain
C, residues 236-251, 277-295; and chain D, residues 139-150,
238-244, and 275-294).
The Pd1 EFE structure includes a double-stranded β-helix
(DSBH, also known as the jellyroll or cupin fold) core,
52
an
architecture that is widely found in members of the Fe(II)/
2OG-dependent oxygenases. We identified eight β-strands, six
from the major β-sheet and two from the minor β-sheet,
forming the DSBH that is surrounded and stabilized by 10 α-
helices (Figure 5A). Among the eight β strands, β1 at the N-
terminus extends the major β-sheet at the end of the DSBH,
whereas the other N-terminal β strand, β2, extends the other
end of the major β-sheet. Among the α helices, α2 and α5 bind
across the surface of the major β-sheet and stabilize it. The C-
terminal α helices (α8, α9, α10) contribute to the active site
for L -Arg binding/interaction. The overall fold of Pd1 EFE is
very similar to that of PK2 EFE with a Cα RMSD of 0.6 Å
(Figure 5B). The loop between the two β-strands (from 233 to
245, shown in yellow) spanning the 2-His-1-Asp metal binding
ligands is longer for the Pd1 EFE. Similarly, the loop between
β8 and α8 is longer in Pd1 EFE (shown in green) than for PK2
EFE. Also, we have located the longer N-terminal region of the
fungal EFE (shown in red) compared to the shorter PK2
enzyme.
The metal-binding site of Pd1 EFE resembles what is found
in most other Fe(II)/2OG-dependent oxygenases, with the
metal coordinated by His251 and Asp253, that derive from the
loop linking β3 and β4, along with His327 that is situated at
the N-terminus of β7. For PK2 EFE, the metal binding
residues (His189, Asp191, and His268) derive from β8, the
loop connecting β8 to β9, and β13 respectively. Structural
alignment of PK2 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG· L -Arg (5V2Y) to the
Mn(II)-bound Pd1 EFE and Pd1 EFE apoprotein shows that
in place of a β strand containing H189 for PK2 EFE there is a
loop that connects β3 and β4 for Pd1 EFE (Figure 6A). This
loop and the His251/Asp253 side chains are disordered in the
Pd1 EFE apoprotein structure which suggests that the presence
of metal is required for the stability of the β3-β4 connecting
loop. A single water occupies the position trans to His327 in
Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG (Figure 6B).

In the Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG crystal structure, 2OG binds to
the metal in a monodentate fashion exclusively with its C5
carboxylate group (Figure 7A). By contrast, either the C1 or
the C5 carboxylates of 2OG coordinate the metal in the dual
conformations for PK2 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG (Figure 7B). Bound
2OG in the Pd1 protein is stabilized by a salt bridge interaction
between Arg336 and the C1 carboxylate group, analogous to
the situation in PK2 EFE where Arg277 interacts with the
distal carboxyl group. Unlike the situation for PK2 EFE·Mn·
2OG (PDB: 5V2X) involving Arg171, the corresponding Arg
residue of Pd1 EFE nearer the metallocenter, Arg228, does not
interact with 2OG. Rather, in the fungal protein Arg228
interacts with the nearby Tyr381 and Thr154, and an electron
density near these residues (insufficiently modeled by water)
was assigned as a chloride ion due to the presence of this anion
during purification and crystallization (Figure 7A). Important
hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues at the active site are
similar for PK2 and Pd1 EFEs (Figure 7B),
17
except that
Cys317 in PK2 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG (which exhibits dual
conformations) is replaced with a single rotamer of Asn380
in the Pd1 enzyme.
To examine whether the active site Cys317 in PK2 EFE
versus Asn380 at the corresponding position in the Pd1 EFE
accounted for their significant differences in the protein color
after Ni-NTA chromatography, partition ratios, or other
properties, we studied the N380C variant of Pd1 EFE that
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the correspond-
ing gene and purified in the same manner as the nonvariant
protein. We showed that the identity of the amino acid at this
position was not responsible for the differences between the
two enzymes in the color of as-purified proteins and the
partition ratio; e.g., the partition ratio of the N380C enzyme
was 6.1 ± 1.7 (Figure 4). Like the nonvariant enzyme, the
N380C version of Pd1 EFE exhibited an increase with time in
ethylene and then plateaued, again likely due to substrate
depletion (Figure S7). The kinetic parameters of the variant
protein measured for ethylene production while varying L -Arg
(k

to those of the wild-type enzyme, so the Cys/Asn residue does
not significantly affect the enzyme’s affinity for L -Arg.
For the Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG structure, residues 137−150
do not move significantly toward the active site when the metal
and 2OG are bound. In PK2 EFE this loop acts like a “lid” that
covers or shields the active site from the solvent; however,
movement of this loop might be required to bind L -Arg.
Closing the “lid” for Pd1 EFE would require shifting of a loop
connecting β3-β4 (residues 233 to 245) that will necessitate
movement of the extra-long N-terminal region. Therefore, it is
understandable that binding of L -Arg to Pd1 EFE requires a
severe reorientation of the loops, as also predicted by the
computational studies described below.
Computational Studies of Pd1 EFE. Because we were
unsuccessful in obtaining the structure of Pd1 EFE·Mn·2OG· L -
Arg, either by soaking L -Arg into the Pd1 EFE·Mn·2OG
crystals or by cocrystallization, we used computational
methods to study this form of the protein. Hence, we modeled
the Pd1·Fe(III)·OO
•−
·2OG· L -Arg complex and ran 1 μs MD
simulations. The simulations provided a well-equilibrated
trajectory with an average root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of 1.55 Å (Figure S8). The atomistic analysis
revealed stable interactions between the C1 carboxylate of
2OG and the guanidinium group of Arg228 and between the
C5 carboxylate and guanidium group of Arg336 (Figure S9A)
in agreement with the 2OG interactions observed in the PK2
EFE system (Figure S9B).
16,19
Because the crystal structure of
Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG has the C5 carboxylate of 2OG
coordinated to the metal center (Mn), these interactions
were not present. The simulations showed interactions
between the backbone of Asp253 and the carboxylate of
Asp312, consistent with the Pd1 EFE crystal structure.
Importantly, the flexibility of the 2OG-bound species is similar
for the Pd1 and PK2 systems with congruent RMSD (Figure
S10) as a consequence of similar stabilizing interactions.
In the Pd1 enzyme, the L -Arg substrate demonstrates greater
mobility with higher RMSD than in the PK2 enzyme (Figure
S11) and forms fewer stabilizing interactions, averaging around
three hydrogen bonds throughout the MD trajectory. In
contrast, on average, the PK2 enzyme forms nearly four
hydrogen bonds throughout the trajectory, indicating better
substrate stabilization. In the PK2 system, the substrate adopts
a more constrained L-shaped orientation, whereas in Pd1 EFE,
the L -Arg substrate is more relaxed (Figure 8). Although in
PK2 EFE, Nε of the L -Arg substrate shows stable hydrogen
bonds with Mn(II)-coordinated Asp191, this interaction is
predicted to be lost in the Pd1 enzyme (Figure S12A,B).
Similarly, the interaction between the side chain hydroxyl
group of Thr143 and Nε of L -Arg of Pd1 EFE contrasts with
the interaction between the Thr86 and amino group of L -Arg
in the PK2 system (Figure S12A,B).
16,19
The guanidinium
group of L -Arg interacts with the Pd1 EFE Glu141 carboxylate,
whereas the amino group of L -Arg interacts with the Glu84
carboxylate in the corresponding sequence position of the PK2
EFE (Figure 8).
16,19
Because of the change in the L -Arg
interactions, the substrate binds in a position away from the
Fe(III)-center in the Pd1 system compared to the PK2 system
(Figure S13). Additionally, we observed two distinct
conformations of the L -Arg substrate in the Pd1 system, like
what was seen in the PK2 system,
19
however, with much more

of 6.5 Å compared to 4.2 Å in PK2 EFE.

frequently represented intermediate states between A and B
than in the PK2 enzyme. The Pd1 EFE conformation A (where
the C5 of L -Arg faces toward the metal) is significantly more
prevalent in the MD trajectory compared to conformation B
(where the C5 of L -Arg faces away from the metal), unlike the
PK2 system where conformation B is the most populated.
However, in the Pd1 system, the C5 of L -Arg is farther from
the metal center than in PK2. The average distance between
the C5 of L -Arg is 6.4 Å in the Pd1 system, compared to 5.1 Å
observed in the PK2 system dynamics (4.2 Å in the crystal
structure of PK2 EFE), where conformation B is most
populated (Figure S13). Also of interest, Tyr192 was shown
to undergo a significant reorientation leading to a twisted
peptide bond upon binding of L -Arg to the PK2 enzyme,
16
whereas the comparable residue Tyr254 of Pd1 EFE does not
appear to shift significantly with L -Arg binding.
Furthermore, we implemented DCCA analysis to explore
the correlated and anticorrelated motions involved in the Pd1
EFE·Fe(III)·OO
•−
·2OG· L -Arg complex. There are correlated/
anticorrelated motions in three significant regions of the
enzyme, namely, the residues that form (a) the loop between
α3 and α4 (125-150), (b) the loop connecting β5 and β6
(270-290), and (c) the region forming α8 and α9 (368-400).
Of these three regions, residues 270-290 are disordered in
Chain A of the Pd1 EFE crystal structure. Region (b) is
anticorrelated with regions (a) and (c), similar to what was
observed in the PK2 system (Figures 9A and S14).
19
Region
(c) is correlated with (a) (Figure 9A), in contrast to the
anticorrelated motion observed between corresponding regions
in the PK2 system.
19
Importantly, these regions consist of the
residues (Glu141, Thr143) that interact with the L -Arg
substrate, especially region (a), which is expected to act as a
lid for L -Arg binding. Hence, the correlated/anticorrelated
motions exhibited by these regions are important for substrate
binding and proper orientation. PCA analysis also showed that
regions (b) and (c) are highly flexible and seem to be moving
away from the active site, resulting in L -Arg displacement in the
case of the Pd1 system (Figure 9B). Overall, the MD
simulations predicted changes in L -Arg binding due to the
changes in its interactions with the Pd1 protein residues and
the correlated/anticorrelated motions, which could facilitate a
greater level of ethylene production compared to L -Arg
hydroxylation in the Pd1 enzyme.
To explore the possible O
2
access tunnels in the Pd1
enzyme, we carried out analysis using CAVER for the
structures obtained from the equilibrated portion of the MD.
Based on our analysis, we observed a tunnel with a bottleneck
radius of 1.11 Å through which the O
2
can access the Fe center
in an offline orientation (Figure 10), similar to the one
predicted in the PK2 system, which has a 1.15 Å bottleneck
radius.
22
The tunnel residues that act as gatekeepers in Pd1
EFE include Asp263, Glu264, Pro303, and Phe105 (Figure
S15), while in PK2 EFE, residues Gln200, Asp202, Thr243,

site of Pd1 EFE, the tunnel is surrounded by hydrophobic
residues, including Arg228, Val258, Phe309, Ala340, and

CONCLUSIONS
This work extends our understanding of the biochemical
properties and is the first to describe the structure of a
eukaryotic version of the EFE. Although clearly related in
sequence and structure to the well-characterized bacterial PK2
enzyme, Pd1 EFE has several distinct features. One suggested
distinction at the L -Arg binding site is an Asn residue in Pd1
EFE compared to a Cys residue at the active site of PK2 EFE.
We created and used the N380C variant to show that, while
the variant Pd1 enzyme activity is decreased compared to the
nonvariant enzyme, the substitution does not account for the
following distinct properties of these EFE proteins.
As purified using a Ni-NTA column, PK2 EFE is blue in
color and possesses near stoichiometric amounts of nickel that
is most likely acquired from the resin, whereas Pd1 EFE has a
low metal ion content and is faint yellow in color that might
correspond to low levels of bound ferric ion. The crystal
structures of these enzymes reveal a more open access site for
the Pd1 enzyme that could account for ease of nickel
dissociation as well as a nearby positive surface charge that
could reduce nickel cation binding to the enzyme active site
(Figure 11).
The anaerobic UV−visible difference spectrum of Pd1 EFE
suggests that 2OG chelates the active site Fe(II) in the absence
of L -Arg to produce three low energy MLCT transitions, with
little change occurring when L -Arg is added. These results
contrast with the situation for PK2 EFE where the difference
spectrum for enzyme with 2OG is very weak but is several-fold
enhanced by the addition of L -Arg to yield less-well-
distinguished MLCT transitions at greater energy. Given
their similarities in active sites, the basis for the shift in
wavelengths is unclear but is presumed to reflect small changes
in the dihedral angle between the carbonyl and C1 carboxyl
group of 2OG. The increase in intensity induced by L -Arg for
PK2 EFE was attributed to a transition from primarily
monodentate coordination to chelation of the metal
accompanied by a significant shift of Tyr192.
16
Such a shift
of the analogous residue in Pd1 EFE, Tyr254, is not predicted
to occur and may lead to chelation of Fe(II) in Pd1 EFE
whether L -Arg is present or not. Surprisingly, however, the
crystal structure of Pd1 EFE·Mn(II)·2OG depicts primarily
monodentate coordination of 2OG in a reversed conformation,
i.e., with the C5 carboxylate rather than C1 carboxylate bound
to Mn(II). We hypothesize that the crystal lattice prevents
2OG from binding as a chelate species and this may also
prevent L -Arg binding.
We showed that Pd1 EFE simultaneously generates
ethylene, succinate, and P5C, like the PK2 enzyme. Moreover,
we confirmed the expectation that both PK2 and Pd1 EFEs
catalyze the uncoupled decomposition of 2OG to produce
succinate and CO
2
when L -Arg is absent, and we demonstrated
that the fungal enzyme, like PK2 EFE, forms small amounts of
3-HP. Although an ethylene/succinate ratio of 2 was originally
reported for PK2 EFE,
10
we found almost a 2-fold larger
partition ratio for this enzyme based on the production levels
for ethylene and P5C. Notably, we observed an even greater
partition ratio for the Pd1 EFE. Thus, the fungal enzyme is
better suited for ethylene production because it would result in
less nondesirable decomposition of L -Arg by cells. The greater
partition ratio observed for Pd1 EFE over PK2 EFE may relate
to the greater distance predicted between Fe(II) and the C5 of
L -Arg for the former enzyme, as predicted by our computa-
tional analyses. A resulting slower rate of L -Arg hydroxylation
could lead to a corresponding increase in reactivity leading to
ethylene production.
Two important structural and conformational considerations
might be relevant to the different ethylene:P5C ratios for Pd1
and PK2 versions of EFE: (i) As described above, the MD
simulation shows that there are changes in the binding
interactions and the flexibility of the L -Arg substrate in the Pd1
system with respect to PK2 EFE, however, the interactions of
the 2OG in Pd1 are consistent in both systems. The diverse
binding interactions and flexibilities of L -Arg in Pd1 and PK2
versions of EFE might influence differentially the hydroxylation
of L -Arg in both enzymes�specifically the higher hydrox-
ylation activity in PK2 EFE and the lower one in the Pd1
enzyme. (ii) On the other hand, the consistent maintenance of
the 2OG interactions in both systems might be responsible for
the sustained ethylene production in both enzymes. The
combined effect of both factors could explain the greater
ethylene:P5C ratio in Pd1 EFE compared to the PK2 enzyme.
However, further experiment-correlated Quantum Mechanics/
Molecular Mechanics reaction mechanisms studies of Pd1
would be necessary to further test this hypothesis. Regardless
of the factors controlling the partition ratio, one important
observation from this work is that the Pd1 enzyme exhibits a
greater value than the PK2 EFE; thus, heterologous production
of EFE for the purpose of ethylene production would benefit
by making use of the Pd1 enzyme due to its decreased
metabolism of the essential cellular metabolite L -Arg.
In conclusion, we have made significant advances in the
characterization of a fungal and first eukaryotic version of EFE.
