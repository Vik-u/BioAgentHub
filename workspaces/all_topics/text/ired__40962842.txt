Enzymatic reductions catalyzed by reductases generally depend on reduced
nicotinamide cofactors as a hydride source. However, for industrial viability, it
is more cost-effective to use water asthe hydrogen source, bypassing the
requirement for the cofactor. Here we report a hybrid photo-biocatalyst sys-
tem based on infrared (IR) light and responsive reductive graphene quantum
dots (rGQDs), for performing the direct transfer of hydrogen from water to
prochiral substrates. The photo-biocatalyst, assembled from rGQDs and cross-
linked aldo-keto reductase (AKR), mediates the synthesis of the pharmaceu-
tical intermediate, (R)−1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)-phenyl] ethanol ((R)−3,5-
BTPE), in 82% yield and >99.99% ee under IR illumination. Our photo-
enzymatic systems can also be effectively used to drive the enzymatic reduc-
tion of imines and alkenes. Since the hybrid photo-biocatalysts are insoluble,
they can be readily recovered and recycled. This work opens new avenues to
create artiﬁcial photo-biocatalyst systems, enabling the facile coupling of
renewable solar energy and sustainable chemical production.
Biocatalysis is widely applied in the pharmaceutical andﬁne chemical
industries in the enantioselective production of valuable chiral che-
micals under mild, aqueous conditions
1–3. Prochiral ketone reductions
catalyzed by ketoreductases, for example, are exquisitely enantiose-
lective and cost-effective methods for the industrial production of the
corresponding chiral alcohols2,4. Chiral amines have also served as a
focus of attention because of the prevalence of nitrogen atoms in
drugs, and imine reductases are used for their preparation
5,6. Similarly,
ene reductases, typically from the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family,
reduce conjugated C = C double bonds
7. All of these enzymes require
efﬁcient regeneration of NAD(P)H cofactors for their cost-effective use
and this typically involves using a dehydrogenase in combination with
as a c r iﬁcial cosubstrate, e.g. alcohol/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH),
glucose/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) or formate/formate dehy-
drogenase (FDH), or a hydrogenase with atom-economic cosubstrate
H
2 (Fig. 1a)8–12. Indeed, enzyme-mediated cofactor regeneration is the
cornerstone of bioreduction but often suffers from unfavorable
kinetics13.
The ideal sacri ﬁcial cosubstrate is water, which can be
used in conjunction with electricity (electrochemical)14,15, or light
(photochemical)16, as the source of hydrogen atoms without the need
for a second enzyme. The use of water as a hydrogen source not only
provides an economical alternative but also represents a greener and
more sustainable option. This approach aligns with the principles of

green chemistry by minimizing environmental impact and enhancing
enzyme compatibility. Much effort has been expended, therefore,
regarding the mediation of electron transfer from water to NAD(P)
+ by
light-driven photocatalysts. This generally involves the use of semi-
conductors such as Au/TiO
2
17 or expensive precious metal complexes
such as [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ (M, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl,
bpy = 2,2’-bipyridyl) as electron mediators in order to avoid undesir-
able side reactions stemming from the radical nature of two non-
catalyzed single electron transfer (SET) steps and convert these two
SETs (and a protonation step) into a single step
17–31. The electro-
chemical method suffers from the same issues, providing the enzy-
matic reductase system with complexity and reducing its economic
viability
14,32,33. In contrast, we envisaged a simpliﬁed biotransformation
that would bypass the traditional cofactor-dependent catalytic path-
way altogether.
Another problem associated with photocatalysis is the weak
penetration of ultraviolet or visible light in various reaction media
because biological tissues, including proteins and nucleic acids,
absorb visible light much more strongly than chemical reaction
media
34. Moreover, although IR light is responsible for half of the
energy of sunlight and has considerable penetration depth in biolo-
gical tissues, its photon energy is relatively low and usually insufﬁcient
to directly stimulate photocatalysis
35,36. This hurdle can be overcome
by introducing an infrared light-responsive component35,s u c ha s
rGQDs in which thep electrons are excited to a high-energy state (e.g.
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) and then transition
back to the s orbital
37,38.
rGQDs were recently developed as near-infrared (NIR) emissive
nanomaterials39,40. We previously demonstrated41 that loading rGQDs
onto TiO2 nanotubes photocatalyst enabled a greatly improved
NADPH photo-regeneration efﬁciency in the presence of M without
extra sacriﬁcial reductant due to abundant Ti-O-Ti bonds formed
between the interfaces, which promoted multi-electron transfer
under NIR excitation. Indeed the new-to-nature reactivity of enzymes
has been greatly extended via light promotion
42,43. Hyster et al.
demonstrated that cofactor or a charge-transfer complex, formed by
cofactor and substrate in the active site, could harvest the incident
photons to induce electron transfer from the cofactor to
substrate
44,45. Based on a NADPH recycling system, these photo-
enzymatic modes work well on asymmetric dehalogenation46, C-C
bond47,48 and C-N bond formations49. In contrast, upon visible light
irradiation, ene-reductases (ER) could initiate single electron oxida-
tion, which has been successfully applied in hydrosulfonylation of
oleﬁns
50,51 and lactone synthesis, without the involving of cofactor
recycling52.
We envisaged that an accessible upconversion material such
as rGQDs, comprising abundant conjugate structures with dangling
carbon bonds, would form stable assemblies with enzymes
through multiple forces (e.g. cation−π,a n i o n−π, hydrophobic andπ−π
interactions). This would allow the short-range transfer of active
hydrogen, generated by water splitting under IR illumination on GQDs,
to the nearby enzyme-bound substrate without the intervention of a
cofactor (Fig.1b). In this work, in order to validate our envisaged
cofactor-free, infrared light driven photoenzymatic catalysis, we choose

hybrid catalyst was constructed bygrafting rGQDs on crosslinked AKR
(AKR-CLEs) through a simple self-assembly. The aggregation makes
them convenient for further characterization. The hybrid material dis-
played stability comparable with that of rGQDs or AKR-CLEs which was
conﬁrmed by their Zeta potential (Fig. S9A). Corresponding XRD and FT-
IR measurements (Fig. S9B and S10) indicated no recrystallization of
rGQD and no new chemical bond formation. The morphology of rGQDs/
AKR was studied by CLSM as presented in Fig.2b, SEM (Fig. S11a) and
TEM (Fig. S11b). The rGQDs/AKR photo-biocatalyst exhibited a regular
coral-like structure, consistent with that of AKR-CLEs (Fig. S3a and S4).
Subsequently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) examination revealed
numerous tiny particles (rGQDs) scattered on the surface of AKR-CLEs
(Fig. 2c). This characteristic was conﬁrmed by the energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) diagram, in which a rough hybrid surface with
nanosized carbon clusters was exhibited (Fig.2d). Compared with the
rGQDs precursor, there isno obvious change in carbon’s chemical states
present in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig.2e). The
resulting hybrid material retained the infrared light responsive ability. Its
optical upconversion emissions at 525 nm, 545 nm and 661 nm are
similar to rGQDs under 980 nm IR light excitation (Fig.2f)

sistent with the rGQDs being anchored on the AKR.
The bandgaps were analyzed before and after the self-assembly of
rGQDs and AKR-CLEs. As shown in Fig.2g, the light absorption of the
rGQDs and rGQDs/AKR ranged from the UV to the infrared region,
consistent with potentially high sunlight utilization efﬁciencies. Assis-
ted by the transformed Kubelka-Munk function versus the energy
(Fig. S12) and the XPS VB spectra (Fig. S13), the bandgap structures of
rGQDs and rGQDs/AKR were depicted, obviously both of them had
suitable photoredox potentials for water splitting in theory (Fig.2h).
Therefore, we evaluated the photocatalytic water-splitting perfor-
mance of rGQDs. As shown in Fig. S14, rGQDs exhibit photocatalytic
activity for hydrogen production from water splitting under infrared
light irradiation, with a H

shown in Fig.2i, the presence of hydroxyl radicals from photocatalytic
water splitting under illumination was successfully detected by ESR.
Molecular simulations and catalysis for rGQDs/reductase photo-
biocatalyst
The molecular features of assembled rGQDs/AKR were characterized
by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with and without bound
NADPH. Owing to the variety of conformations, rGQDs can bind to
various sites on the enzyme. The two-layered rGQDs that was initially
located at different positions relative to AKR-NADPH/AKR with a dis-
tance of 30 Å (Fig. S18 and S19) eventually formed stable binding
complexes of rGQDs/AKR-NADPH and rGQDs/AKR within 400 ns MD
simulations, as indicated by the converged RMSD (root mean squared
deviation) and distance proﬁles (Fig. S20–23). The converged RMSD
proﬁles conﬁrmed the formation of stable binding complexes of
rGQDs–AKR both with and without NADPH cofactor (Fig. S20 and S21).
The equilibrated binding conformations showed extensive cation−π
and anion−π interactions between the surface residues of AKR and
rGQD, which have been reported to have an interaction strength of
~14–15 kcal·mol
–1 (close to the magnitude of a hydrogen bond)61,62.
Hydrophobic and π−π interactions also contributed to the stable
binding. The difference in locations of rGQDs on the AKR surfaces can
be ascribed to varied charge distribution due to the binding of NADPH.
Notably, structure comparison of the equilibrated rGQDs/AKR-NADPH
and rGQDs/AKR with the corresponding crystal structures of AKR-
NADPH (PDB: 6KIY) and AKR (PDB: 6KIK) demonstrated that binding of
rGQDs would not cause dramatic conformational changes to the
overall structure and catalytic pocket domain of AKR, and the surface
bound rGQDs would hardly hinder the binding and release of NADPH
and substrate molecules (Fig. S24 and Fig.3).
3,5-BTAP was selected as the substrate to explore the photo-
enzymatic properties of rGQDs/AKR in molecular docking and MD
simulations model. It is usually synthesized by enantioselective
hydrogenation of 3,5-BTAP. As binding of rGQDs would not hinder the
binding of substrate or change the conformation of AKR catalytic
domain, simpliﬁed models were used without rGQDs included.
Expectations for the rGQDs/AKR photo-biocatalyst system require that
the enantioselective reduction of 3,5-BTAP can be initiated by the
active hydrogen generated from water molecules by rGQDs through
infrared light irradiation (Fig.4). On the basis of stably anchored 3,5-
BTAP in the catalytic pocket of AKR (Fig.4a–c), we anticipated that the
distribution of water molecules around the binding 3,5-BTAP, repre-
senting diverse access paths of active hydrogen to the carbon atom of
3,5-BTAP carbonyl group approximately, would play a critical role in
producing the chiral 3,5-BTPE. More speciﬁcally, the position of the
hydrogen atom of water that is located nearest to the carbon atom
(C9) of 3,5-BTAP carbonyl group relative to the plane deﬁned by the
3,5-BTAP atoms C6, C9, and C10 basically determines the chirality of
3,5-BTPE (Fig.4). Hence, the improper dihedral of∠C6-C10-C9-H was
monitored throughout the 20 ns MD simulations, in which H means
the hydrogen atom belonging to the water molecule nearest to 3,5-

the pro-(R) and pro-(S) binding forms of 3,5-BTAP, leading to the
generation of (R)- and (S)-3,5-BTPE respectively. Distributions of the
improper dihedral along MD simulations showed a clear preference for
the pro-(R)b i n d i n gf o r m si nb o t hA K R–NADPH–3,5-BTAP and
AKR–3,5-BTAP systems (Fig. S25d and Fig.4d), resulting in an excellent
enantioselective hydrogenation result (e.e. (R) > 99%).
Molecular docking calculations indeed found two potential
binding conformations of 3,5-BTAP, i.e. the carbonyl-out and the
carbonyl-in ones (Fig. S26). In both binding forms, 3,5-BTAP interacts
with the catalytic pocket residues through hydrogen bonds. However,
due to the electrostatic repulsive interactions between the carbonyl
groups of 3,5-BTAP and AKR Q169 in the carbonyl-in binding form
(Fig. S26b), it is energetically unfavorable relative to the carbonyl-out
binding form. Interestingly, driven by the induced-ﬁt effect, a fast
conformational switch (within 500 ps) from the carbonyl-out to the
carbonyl-in form of 3,5-BTAP was discovered in the MD simulation,
corresponding well with the sudden decrease of the distance between
the carbonyl oxygen atom of 3,5-BTAP and the hydroxyl oxygen atom
of the AKR Y58 sidechain at the starting stage of MD simulation
(Fig. S27a). A representative carbonyl-out form snapshot of the
AKR–3,5-BTAP binding complex was retrieved from the MD trajectory
(Fig. S27c). It shows that, though the aromatic ring of 3,5-BTAP tends to
form π − π stacking interactions with the sidechains of W21 and Y198,
their distances (4.56 Å) are obviously longer than a commonπ − π
stacking interaction distance of 3.50 Å, indicating a transient unstable
interaction. In addition, the inner triﬂuoromethyl group of 3,5-BTAP is
located near a negatively charged carboxyl group of D53 and the
hydrophobic sidechain of I242, which is energetically unfavorable
(Fig. S27c). These factors are the driving force of the conformational
change of the binding 3,5-BTAP.
Data in Fig. S27 demonstrates that the carbonyl-in binding com-
plex equilibrated to a similar conformation to that in Fig.4aw i t h i n
20 ns. The hydrogen bond interaction with Y58 and theπ−π stacking
to W21 are stable, as indicated by their distance pro ﬁles
(Fig. S27b and S28c). The value and distribution of the improper
dihedral ∠C6-C10-C9-H across the MD simulation (Fig. S28d, e) also
showed a clear preference for the pro-(R) binding form of 3,5-BTAP,
agreeing well with our experimental result and validating the results
shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, it is feasible and convenient to apply
rGQDs/AKR as the photocatalyst for water splitting and enantioselec-
tive hydrogenation.
Our molecular simulation data provided pivotal information for
the enantioselective process catalyzed by the rGQDs/AKR photo-
biocatalyst system at the atomic level. These properties were evaluated
by performing the photoenzymatic synthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE in the

absence of both NAD(P)H or NAD(P)+ and a noble metal complex
(Fig. 5a). Figure 5b shows the yields of (R)-3,5-BTPE with different
catalyst systems, namely (rGQDs, AKR, rGQDs/AKR, rGQDs/AKR and
NADP
+, rGQDs/AKR and NADP+ and M) under 18 h infrared light irra-
diation, using isopropanol as cosolvent (50 mW·cm−2). It clearly shows
that no (R)-3,5-BTPE was observed with only AKR or rGQDs addition,
but once the combination of rGQDs/AKR was provided, (R)-3,5-BTPE
was produced in up to 82% yield with 99.99% ee, thus demonstrating
the success of our method. We also observed that the yields (88%, 96%)
were elevated when M and/or NADP
+ were added to the rGQDs/AKR
photo-biocatalyst system, but these were not signiﬁcant compared to
those in the absence of these two coenzymes. We conclude that,
considering the high costs of both NADP
+ and M, the photocatalytic
synthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE assisted by only rGQDs/AKR is an important
step in the right direction. We also studied the effect of the wavelength
of the light source. As shown in Fig.5c, the yield of (R)-3,5-BTPE was 0
under dark conditions, showing that light illumination was the
requirement for this photochemical reaction. The reaction system also
worked well under the irradiation of visible light or simulated sunlight
(AM1.5 G), with a yield of 63% and 86%, respectively. The lower yield
under visible light compared with under IR light showed that our
photo-biocatalyst had better responsiveness to IR light. To establish
the optimum wavelength for illumination, the synthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE
was conducted using different monochromatic light sources (365 nm,
7 5 0n ma n d9 8 0n m ) .A ss h o w ni nF i g .5d, it is apparent that the NIR
750 nm is the best, i.e. close to the optimum upconversion excitation
wavelength of rGQDs (780 nm). The most suitable IR light intensity was
50 mW·cm
−2 (Fig. 5e). When the light intensity is elevated to 100 or
200 mW·cm−2, the yields are all greatly decreased to 2.9% and 1.7%,
respectively. The lower yields are a result of reductions in photo-
biocatalyst activity caused by the excessive local heating through the
photothermal effect of the rGQDsupon strong IR irradiation. This
explanation is in agreement with the results of comparison experi-
ments (Fig.5f).
To assess the possible effect of rGQDs on enantioselectivity, an
imine reductase AoIRED, displaying poor enantioselectivity in (1-
methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin) reduction, was examined

enzyme’s catalytic preference (Fig.5g and S31). Additionally, in the
presence of isopropanol cosolvent, cinnamaldehyde was reduced to
form 3-phenylpropanol (65%) through the synergistic catalysis of ene

O nt h eo t h e rh a n d ,a ne l e c t r o nm e diator may negatively affect the
conversion system due to possible ligand exchange with the active
residue of the enzyme, leading to a signiﬁcant drop in yield (Fig.5ga n d
S34b)
65. These results strongly suggest that the enantioselectivity and
hydrogenation activity of the photoenzymatic system are controlled
separately by the enzyme and photocatalyst, respectively.
To further illustrate the function of rGQDs in promoting solar
light energy conversion, we integrated TiO2 with strong UV and low
visible-light absorbing properties into the above photoenzymatic
system. Under simulated sunlight, (S)-3-chloro-1-phenyl-1-propanol
((S)-CPPO), a key chiral intermediate for the synthesis of the chiral
side chain of Fluoxetine and Atomoxetine, obtained in 72.3% yield,
which is 2.7 times and 2.6 times of that without TiO
2 and rGQDs,
respectively (Fig. 5h and S35) 66–69. What’s more, corresponding
electrostatic assembled hybrid catalysts (TiO2-rGQDs/NaCBR) can be
recycled with excellent chemical stability, maintaining 90% of its
original catalytic efﬁciency and consistent enantioselectivity (99.9%
ee) after 6-cycles (Fig.5i).
An isotope-tracer experiment was carried out to conﬁrm the
hydrogen donor in the cofactor-independent photo-enzymatic
reduction system mediated by rGQDs/AKR to synthesize (S)-1-(2-
chlorophenyl) ethanol. The high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS)
analysis of the product obtained using D
2O reveals that it was com-
pletely labelled with two deuteriums, conﬁrming that water was the
hydrogen resource (Fig. S36-37). In 3,5-BTAP and cinnamaldehyde
reductions isopropanol, a more energetically favorable source of the
hydrogen atoms than water, was used as a cosolvent. However, it is
also feasible to use DMF as the sole co-solvent for 1-methyl-3,4-
dihydroisoquinoline reduction or synthesize (S)-CPPO in the absence
of a cosolvent. Hence, we conclude that with this hybrid photo-bio-
catalyst, water can be used as the sole source of hydrogen.
Discussion
In conclusion, we have successfully constructed a infrared light
responsive hybrid rGQDs/AKR photo-reductase system that requires
neither an expensive noble metal complex nor an expensive cofactor
for its activity. Moreover, the two hydrogen atoms required for the
reduction are provided by a molecule of water. The catalyst was
essentially enantiospeciﬁc ( > 99.99%) in the synthesis of the chiral
alcohol, (R)-3,5-BTPE. This custom-designed hybrid system provides
active hydrogen atoms through photo-catalytic water decomposition
and directly delivers them to the immobilized AKR for transfer to the
ketone substrate. The rGQDs was also successfully combined with an
imine reductase and an ene reductase to afford 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tet-
rahydroisoquinoline and 3-phenylpropanol, respectively, via IR-driven
photo-enzymatic reduction.
This methodology represents a paradigm shift in the develop-
ment of enantioselective reductions of prochiral ketones by invol-
ving cofactor-independent photo-biocatalysts in combination with
water as the sole source of hydrogen atoms and NIR light as the
source of energy. We anticipate that this methodology can be used to
design efﬁcient hybrid-reductase systems that are sensitive to
infrared light, and could also be used to study and control
protein activity in cells and organisms. Since our hybrid system is a
heterogeneous immobilized biocatalyst, it can also be readily
recycled and/or used in continuous ﬂow operation. In short, we
believe that this unprecedented example of a hybrid photo-
biocatalyst that requires only NIR radiation and water to
perform sustainable, highly (enantio)selective reductions could
represent the tip of an iceberg. It could form a basis for the devel-
opment of various cofactor independent biotransformations using
only water and light as the source of, respectively, reducing equiva-
lents and energy.

Preparation of assembled photo-biocatalyst rGQDs/AKR and
TiO2-rGQDs/NaCBR
The photo-biocomposite rGQDs/AKR was obtained by electrostatic
self-assembly under mechanical oscillation. Typically, aldo-keto
reductase aggregates were dispersed in a 5 mL rGQDs (5 mg·mL
−1)
suspension with aﬁnal concentration of 5 mg·mL−1. Then the mixture
was shaken continuously at 10 °C for 4 h to obtain hybrid material
rGQDs/AKR, which were collected by freeze-drying after
centrifugation.
To prepare the bio-inorganic hybrid TiO
2-rGQDs/NaCBR, the
assembly of TiO2 and rGQDs was ﬁrst performed by shaking the
mixture of 200 mg of TiO 2 and 40 mL of rGQDs suspension
(5 mg·mL−1) at 60 °C overnight. After centrifugal separation and
washing with 10 mL of deionized water three times, 50 mg of TiO2/
rGQDs composite was obtained and then assembled with carbonyl
reductase (5 mg·mL
−1) in 5 mL PBS buffer, pH 7.0, at 10 °C for 4 h to
give TiO 2-rGQDs/NaCBR after collection by freeze-drying and
centrifugation.
General procedure for the photo-enzymatic reduction reactions
All photo-enzymatic catalysis was carried out in a 45 mL custom-
made quartz reactor (Fig. S15) at 20 °C. For (R)-3,5-BTPE synthesis,
10 mg of rGQDs/AKR were dispersed in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS buffer) (pH = 7.0, 100 mM), then 3,5-BTAP (32.3 mg,
0.125 mmol) and 3μL of isopropanol cosolvent was added. After
that, the reactor was irradiated at AM1.5 G with an opticalﬁlter (CEL-
HXF300) for 18 h. When the photoenzymatic assays were performed
in the presence of NADP
+ and (or) electron mediator, 0.1 mM of
NADP+, and (or) 0.25 mM of M were added to the reaction system in
sequence. After the reactions, the target product was extracted
from the supernatant in the reaction solution by 3 mL of anhydrous
n-hexane. The yield and ee values were determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography.
For 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin reduction, 10 mg of AoIRED
and 5 mg of rGQDs were dispersed in 5 mL of PBS buffer (pH = 7.0,
100 mM), then 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin (18.2 mg, 0.125 mmol)
and 100μL of DMF were added. For cinnamaldehyde reduction, 10 mg
of OYE1 and 5 mg of rGQDs were dispersed in 5 mL of PBS buffer

The yield and ee values were determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography.
To detect the recycling efﬁciency of TiO
2-rGQDs/NaCBR, 15 mg of
TiO2-rGQDs/NaCBR was dispersed in 5 mL of PBS buffer (pH = 7.0,
100 mM) at a quartz reactor. Then, 3-chloro-1-phenylpropan-1-one
(21.0 mg, 0.125 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred and
irradiated at AM1.5 G (CEL-HXF300, 50 mW·cm

After that, the TiO2-rGQDs/NaCBR was separated from the reaction
mixture by centrifugation (10000 xg, 15 min) and reused for the next
cycle of reactions under standard reaction conditions. The liquid
supernatant was extracted by anhydrous n-hexane and the yield was
determined by HPLC.
