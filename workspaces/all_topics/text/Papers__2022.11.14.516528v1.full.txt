Abstract 
A mesophilic PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis (IsPETase) has been shown to exhibit 
high PET hydrolysis activity, but its low thermostability limits its industrial applications. We 
herein developed an engineering strategy for IsPETase to enhance PET hydrolysis activity, 
thermostability, and protein folding  of the enzyme. Balance-directed Z1-PETase variant 
outperforms the stability-directed Z2-PETase variant under both mesophilic and thermophilic 
conditions, although Z2-PETase exhibits higher thermostability than Z1 -PETase. The Z1-
PETase is also superior to Fast-PETase, Dura -PETase, and LC -CICCG in terms of 
depolymerization rate regardless of temperature conditions  we tested . Thus, maintaining a 
balance between PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability is essential for the development 
of high-performance PET hydrolases. In a pH-stat bioreactor, Z1-PETase depolymerized >90% 
of both transparent and colored post -consumer PET powder s within 24 and 8 hours at 40 °C 
and 55 °C, respectively, demonstrating that the balance -directed IsPETase variant produced 
herein may be applicable in the bio-recycling of PET.

Introduction 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used in the production of bottles, sheets, films, and 
fibers that are commonly found in food packaging and clothes. It is estimated that 60 metric 
tons of PET are produced each year,1 although there are no clear estimates for forms other than 
solid-state PET resins . PET product wastes are largely released into the environment and 
known to be highly resistant to natural decomposition, 3 making the PET industry a major 
contributor of plastic pollution. The major ingredients of PET, including purified terephthalic 
acid (pTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG), are derived from crude oil refinery;2 the industry 
that have recourse to a petroleum -based economy is no longer sustainable  despite the high 
demand. Petrochemical and food corp orations, reclaimers, and governments  are steadily 
seeking to improve available technologies for eco-friendly removal or closed-loop recycling of 
PET; however, the current methods of bottle-to-bottle mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, and 
chemo-depolymerization are limited4-6 in their usefulness. 
 In recent years, enzymatic PET depolymerization, which is  widely applicable in the 
concept of a circular economy , has emerged as an alternative of the existing recycling 
technologies.7 Although no significant degradation of PET but surface modification by 
enzymes was reported f rom the mid -late 20th century to the early 2000s ,8 it has now been 
shown that the depolymerization rate of PET near its  glass-transition temperature (Tg) by 
cutinase-like enzymes is unexpectedly fast .9-12 In fact, Tournier et al. achieved 90% 
depolymerization of post-consumer colored-flake PET waste at 72°C in less than 10 h using an 
engineered variant of the thermophilic leaf-branch compost cutinase (LC-C).12 
 Yoshida et al. reported that the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis utilizes PET as its sole 
source of carbon and energy via hydrolysis of PET by the IsPETase enzyme.13 This enzyme 
exhibits highest PET hydrolysis activity at an ambient temperature of approximately 30˚C, at 
which the structure of PET is more glassy and difficult for enzymes to access.13 The mesophilic

PET depolymerase brings the  depolymerization system into the physiological temperature 
range, which hints at a possible approach for the free biotransformation of PET into any product 
that an organism is able to generate.14-16 However, low temperature s decrease the specific 
volume of polymeric materials, thereby increasing the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of 
geometrical change, resulting in low deformability of substrates.17 This implies that enzyme 
access and complex formation with interfacial chains are impeded at low temperature s (Fig. 
1a). It means that th e mesophilic PET depolymerase has accessibility to overcome this 
limitation. In the last 6 years,  several monumental  thermostable and durable variants of 
IsPETase have been engineered18-21; however, these have not been reported to reach the 
stability and efficacy of thermophilic cutinases at high temperatures. 
 In this work, we present our engineered PET depolymerase (Z1-PETase) that exhibits 
high thermostability, PET hydrolysis activity, and soluble  protein yield . Z1-PETase 
outperforms the  stability-directed Z2 -PETase variant,  Dura-PETase, LC-CICCG, and Fast-
PETase variants over a broad range of temperature s (30°C–60°C) in a dialysis system. Z1-
PETase showed a decomposition rate of >90% for post-consumer PET powder within 24 h at 
40°C and 8 h at 55 °C in a pH -stat bioreactor. These results emphasize the importance of 
maintaining a balance between enzyme activity and thermostability in the engineering of PET 
hydrolases.

Results 
Increase in protein yield through β-strand modification of the hydrophobic core 
Because amorphous polymeric chains can be crystallized above Tg and the 
deformability of the crystalline region is much lower than that of the amorphous region , the 
optimal temperature for the operation of an artificial enzyme depolymerization system is 
approximately 60°C–70°C (Fig. 1a) .12,23 We hypothesized that  a mesophilic depolymerase 
emerged to have improved thermal stability would outperform other thermophilic enzymes at 
all temperatures, as high activity at low temperatures is a result of the sum effect of turnover 
rate, adsorption rate , and attack capacity on solid PET (Fig. 1a) . Thus, we evaluated the 
potential activity of a mesophilic depolymerase at desired temperatures  with an aim of 
improving the thermal stability of IsPETase without compromising its activity. To this end, we 
introduced N233C and S282C mutations to create an additional disulfide bond  (SS1) in the 
quadruple-point IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N246D variant (Is-4p) that we previously reported ,22 
resulting in the generation of the IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N233C/N246D/S288C variant ( Is-4pC) 
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).22,24 Surprisingly, the derivative melting temperature (TmD) of 
Is-4pC was found to be 72°C, which was 10 °C and 23°C higher than that of Is-4p and wild-
type IsPETase, respectively (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, Is-4pC exhibited 
1.5 and 5-fold higher PET depolymerization activity than those of Is-4p and wild-type IsPETase, 
respectively, at 40°C (Fig. 1b). However, the expression of Is-4pC dramatically reduced the 
amount of soluble protein compared with wild-type, and most of the expressed protein formed 
insoluble aggregates (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). This limited further evaluation of 
PET depolymerization capacity and analysis of potential applications of th e variant. The 
production of large amounts of soluble PET hydrolase is an important parameter in industrial-
level PET biodegradation in addition to its thermal stability and activity. Thus, we attempted 
to increase the solubility of IsPETase by reconstructing the β-sheet that is partially disrupted

by P18118, replaced P181 with various other residues, including A, G, S, C, T, V , I, L, Y , and F 
in the Is -4p template . Interestingly, all variants exhibited up to 25-fold increase in soluble 
protein yield compared with Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) . However, most 
variants showed  a dramatically decrease in TmD values and PET hydrolysis activities 
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). One exception was the P181V variant, which exhibited 
comparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity to Is-4p (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3) . 
Introduction of the P181V mutation into Is-4pC resulted in a 40-fold increase in soluble protein 
yield compared with Is-4pC, with comparable TmD value and PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 1b, 
c, Supplementary Figs. 1–3). We further observed no significant difference between Is -
4pC+P181V and Is -4pC in Tm D values and the total amount of expressed protein, which 
indicate that the enhanced yield of  the soluble Is-4pC+P181V protein is not due to increased 
intracellular protein stability or enhanced transcriptional and translational processes, but rather 
due to post-translational folding. Specifically, mutation of the trans-proline 181 unchains the 
dihedral angles of this residue, especially at the ψ angle, triggering a large change in the φ angle 
of the pre -proline A180 (Fig. 1 d). We speculated that this structural change occur s in most 
P181-point variants and strengthens the β-strand network, thereby increasing the efficiency of 
folding of the Is-4pC+P181V variant (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4). 
The region containing A180 and P181 is located at the intersection of two imaginary 
hemispheres of the protein hydrophobic core. The above results indicate the importance of this 
region in folding of the protein (Fig. 1f). We replaced A180 of Is-4pC+P181V with other small 
residues, such as G, S, T, and V , to investigate how further modification of the region affects 
protein solubility. Interestingly, all four variants showed an increase in soluble protein yield 
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, Is-4pC+A180V+P181V (an Is-8p variant) 
showed an approximately 65% increase in soluble protein yield compared with Is-4pC+P181V , 
which corresponds to a 65-fold increase compared with Is-4pC (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary

Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, the thermal stability and PET hydrolysis activity of Is-8p were 
comparable to those of Is-4pC (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3). This implies that the 
folding process of IsPETase is influenced by multiple structural factors as well as β-sheet repair 
at the protein core. 
 
Engineering with non-negative and complementary accumulation 
The improved soluble protein yield of Is -8p led us to apply various enzym e 
engineering approaches. We modified the local surface charge of Is-8p by mutating R132 and 
R224 to E and substituting N37 with D in an attempt to optimize the adsorption process of the 
protein to the PET substrate. Although the TmD values of the R132E and R224E mutants were 
slightly lower than that of Is -8p, all three variants showed up to 50% enhance ment in PET 
hydrolysis activity at 50°C compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further 
enhance the thermal stability of Is -8p, we introduced six new disulfide bonds by creating the 
following double mutants: A171C+S193C (SS2), A202C+V211C (SS3), N73C+A102C (SS4), 
A80C+V149C (SS5), T195C+R224C (SS6), and N275C+F284C (SS7). Among these, SS4, SS5, 
and SS6 had decreased TmD values compared with Is -8p, implying that disulfide bonds were 
not formed in these mutants (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, SS2, SS3, and SS7 
increased TmD values by approximately 4°C, suggesting that these disulfide bonds were indeed 
present in Is -8p (Fig. 2a , Supplementary Fig. 1). The PET hydrolysis activity of  the SS 2 
mutation increased by 20%, whereas that of SS3 and SS 7 mutations slightly decreased 
compared with Is-8p at 50°C (Fig. 2a). The wobbling W185 residue is known to be crucial for 
both enzyme activity and protein stability. 26 Because S214 is located in the vicinity of this 
residue, we replaced S214 with 19 other residues to identify the optimal residue in terms of 
enzyme activity and protein stability . Although PET hydrolysis activity decreased compared 
with that of Is -8p in all cases, thermal stability  was improved in several of the new variants

(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5). In particular, the TmD value of S214Y was 6.5 °C higher than 
that of Is-8p (Fig. 2a). 
Modification of Is -8p enabled us to  identify seven mutation points that improved 
thermal stability, enhanced PET hydrolysis activity, or had other complementary effects. Next, 
we combined multiple mutations to design a total of nine combinatorial variants of Is -8p, 
including six balance -directed variants (Is -8pCom1–Is-8pCom6) and three stability -directed 
variants (Is-8pCom7–Is-8pCom9) (Table 1). All six balance-directed variants exhibited enhanced 
activities against both p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB) and PET, along with either increased 
(Is-8pCom1, Is-8pCom5, and Is-8pCom6) or decreased ( Is-8pCom2, Is-8pCom3, and Is-8pCom4) TmD 
values compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b–d and Supplementary Fig. 1). All three stability-directed 
variants increased TmD values compared with Is-8p but decreased enzyme activity (Fig. 2b–d 
and Supplementary  Fig. 1). These results i ndicate that the combinatorial variants were 
generated in the intended directions, and we selected the Is-8pCom6 (Z1-PETase) and Is-8pCom9 
(Z2-PETase) variants as the final balance- and stability-directed variants, respectively (Fig. 2b–
d). Z2-PETase with a TmD value of 86°C has much higher thermostability than Z1-PETase with 
a TmD value of 74°C; conversely, Z1-PETase showed a 50% increase in PET hydrolysis activity 
while Z2-PETase showed somewhat decreased activity, compared with Is-8p (Fig. 2b, d). 
 
Structural interpretation of the engineered mutants 
 The crystal structure of Z2 -PETase provides a structural explanation of the effects of 
the introduced mutations in this study  (Supplementary Table. 3). We identified two disulfide 
bonds of IsPETase wild-type, i.e., SS1Ori and SS2Ori, in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3). The four mutated 
residues in Is-4p, namely, S121E, D186H, S242T, and N246D , were found to be located at 
identical positions as those in Z2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Table. 1). All Is-8pCom variants having the 
A180V and P181V mutations in Z2-PETase showed a significant increase in soluble protein

production level compared with Is-8p, although the increase in production level was somewhat 
reduced by further addition of mutation points  (Table. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Three 
mutations, i.e., N37D, R132E, and R224E, resulted in a large change in the protein surface 
charge to negative, and in fact, the pI values of wild-type and Z2-PETase were 9.44 and 7.54, 
respectively. The charge change occurs far from the active site, likely facilitating the adsorption 
of the enzyme to the PET substrate and thereby increasing PET hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Fig. 7). The four new disulfide bonds (SS1, SS2, SS3, and SS7) that were formed 
after the introduction of mutations stabilized the periphery of each disulfide-formed region in 
Z2-PETase (Fig. 3 and Supplementary  Figs. 8 and 9). Although the length of SS3 was 2.3 Å, 
which was slightly longer than the optimal length of a disulfide bond, the other three disulfide 
bonds were within the optimal disulfide bond length range (Supplementary Fig. 8). The S214Y 
mutation stabilized the region surrounding the wobbling W185; however, the S214Y mutation 
appears to interfere with the dynamics of W185, resulting in a dramatic decrease in PET 
hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9).  
 
Evaluation of variants in a product-deficient system 
We compared Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase to identify the most superb IsPETase variant. 
The stability -directed variant Z2-PETase was much more thermostable  than the balance -
directed variant Z1-PETase; TmD between the two variants was found to be 1 2°C (Fig. 2b). 
The results of heat inactivation experiments verified the high thermostability of Z2-PETase as 
activity was maintained for approximately 10 h at 70°C, whereas Z1-PETase activity was lost 
after 1 h (Fig. 4a). This further confirms the increased thermostability of Z2-PETase compared 
with Z1-PETase. However, Z1-PETase maintained its activity for several days at 60 °C, 
indicating somewhat higher thermostability than Is-8p (Fig. 4a).

The closed PET hydrolysis system used above has considerable limitations for accurate 
quantification of enzyme kinetic performance and evaluation of complete PET 
depolymerization because continuous ester hydrolysis interferes with enzyme activity by 
lowering the pH of the reaction mixture and the inhibition of  the enzyme activity  by the 
hydrolysis products (Fig. 4b). Thus, to compare PET hydrolysis by Z1-PETase and Z2-PETase 
over a broad range of temperatures, we designed a product-deficient in-situ dialysis system to 
maintain the pH at 8.0 and keep the level of hydrolysis products low. This system was applied 
to PET hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 10), which showed that the PET depolymerizing 
activity of Z1-PETase was higher than that of Z2-PETase across the entire temperature range 
from 30°C to 60°C, although the optimal temperatures of these two variants were different (Fig. 
4c–f). These results suggest that maintaining or enhancing the high activity of mesophilic PET 
hydrolase is critical for the development of a high-performance PET hydrolase with enhanced 
thermostability, and consequentially, we selected Z1-PETase as the IsPETase variant with the 
highest PET depolymerizing activity among the tested combinatorial variants.  
We then compared the PET depolymerizing activity of Z1-PETase with those of other 
engineered PET hydrolases such as LC-CICCG, Dura-PETase, and Fast-PETase, and surprisingly, 
Z1-PETase kinetically outperforms LC-CICCG and Dura-PETase at all temperatures tested and 
exhibits high depolymerization rates (76.9%–90.1%) (Fig. 4c–f). Fast -PETase exhibited a 
slightly faster lag phase than  Z1-PETase at 30 °C and 40 °C; however, activity decreased 
dramatically at 50°C and 60°C, which was consistent with the much lower thermostability of 
Fast-PETase (64°C)20 than Z1-PETase (Fig. 4c -f). Interestingly, the PET depolymerizing 
activity of Dura-PETase was much lower than that of Z1-PETase at all temperature ranges (Fig. 
4c-f), although the thermostability of these IsPETase variants was similar. These results further 
emphasize the importance of maintaining or enhancing mesophilic PET hydrol ysis activity 
during the development of high-performance PET hydrolases.

Z1-PETase was able to completely depolymerize the 15 × 15 × 0.25-mm PET film (6.1% 
crystallinity) at 40°C and 50°C within approximately 3.2 and 2.2 days, respectively (Fig. 4g). 
Film decomposition showed a clear lag phase, which reflects the time period required for the 
formation of a sufficient contact area between the surface of PET and the enzyme via initial 
hydrophilization of the film (Fig. 4g). The lag phase of film decomposition was much longer 
than that of powder decomposition at the same temperature (Fig. 4 d, e, g), suggesting that the 
availability of the PET surface for enzyme adsorption determines the initial depolymerization 
rate. 
 
Depolymerization of post-consumer PET powder using a pH-stat bioreactor  
We evaluated the industrial application of Z1-PETase by studying  PET plastic 
depolymerization using a pH-stat bioreactor. We used transparent post-consumer PET powder 
originated from transparent PET flakes collected in Daegu, Korea as the substrate (Fig. 5a and 
Supplementary Fig. 11). When the bioreactor was operated at 40°C under the pH-8.0 stationary 
condition with 2.5% (w/v) of the substrate, 50% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 8 h, 
and 92.5% of the PET powder was depolymerized in 24 h  (Fig. 5b) . At 55°C, the initial 
depolymerization rate was much higher than that at 40°C, demonstrating the thermal effect on 
PET degradation. At 55°C, 50% and 93% of the PET powder were depolymerized in 2 h and 8 
h, respectively  (Fig. 5b).  This corresponds to a specific productivity value of 5.2 
gmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1, with a maximum rate of 17.2 gmonomer∙l−1∙h−1∙μmolenzyme−1 observed 
in the early phase of the reaction. Due to the high activity and stability of Z1-PETase, the final 
depolymerization rates of PET powder at 40°C and 55°C were not significantly different from 
each other (Fig. 5b).  
It should be noted  that colored PET plastics, such as brown plastic  beer bottles, are 
difficult to recycle because they contain impurities, such as pigments, nylon and iron. Therefore,

colored PET plastics reduce the quality of transparent PET plastics when both are mixed, and 
colored PET plastics are not suitable as raw mater ials for applications in the textile industry. 
We prepared colored post-consumer PET powder in the same way as transparent post-consumer 
PET powder and performed decomposition experiments using a pH-stat bioreactor to test the 
efficacy of our system for difficult-to-recycle substrates (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11). 
Interestingly, Z1-PETase was able to depolymerize colored PET at a rate similar  to that of 
transparent PET at both 40°C and 55°C, indicating that Z1-PETase can depolymerize at the 
same rate regardless of the types of PET plastics  (Fig. 5b, d). At both temperatures, the final 
depolymerization rate of colored PET was 90.2%, which was  slightly lower than th at of 
transparent PET, possibly due to impurities contained in colored PET (Fig. 5d).

Discussion 
Proteins are classified as psychrophilic, mesophilic, or thermophilic based on their optimal 
temperature, and the temperature-based classification has also been applied to depolymerases. 
Active site f lexibility is frequently observed in psychrophilic proteins; this  makes enzymes 
more heat-labile but decreases the temperature dependence of catalysis by reducing activation 
enthalpy compensated with more negative activation entropy , which does not improve the 
overall catalytic rate  of enzyme .25 In contrast , high accessibility  of enzyme increases the 
likelihood of complexation at attackable sites  on PET surface , even at high temperatures at 
which substrate conformation is still constrained. We hypothesized that the mesophilic 
behavior of IsPETase is primarily due to its good accessibility combined with heat lability and 
that the reaction rate could therefore be maximized if both activity and stability are optimized; 
but these properties could be conflicting in  the mechanism of  cold-adapted enzymes . The 
soluble protein yield  is an aspect of protein production  that is critical for application at an 
industrial level. Thus, we simultaneously considered three crucial factors, namely, enzyme 
activity, thermostability, and protein folding,  to develop a potent PET hydrolase variant and 
designed a balance-directed protein engineering strategy through non-negative and 
complementary accumulation . The balance -directed variant Z1-PETase and the stability -
directed variant Z2-PETase highlight the importance of considering the above criteria for 
developing and evaluating enzymes suitable for creating an efficient PET degradation system.

Methods 
Site-directed mutagenesis 
 The template used to create all variants is shown in the Supplementary Table. 2.22 The 
variant IsPETaseS121E/D186H/S242T/N246D was subcloned into a pET-15b expression vector at the 
NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The forward and reverse primers used are detailed in 
Supplementary Table. 1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step of site-directed 
mutagenesis was performed using EzPCR™ (EBT-7751, ELPIS-BIOTECH, Daejeon, 
Republic of Korea), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-
Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). The introduction of mutations was confirmed through 
sequencing, which was performed by Bioneer (Daejeon, Republic of Korea).  
 
Protein preparation  
 The pET-15b expression vectors containing the desired genes were transformed into 
Escherichia coli Rosetta gami-B cells. Cells were cultured at 37°C in 1 L of lysogeny broth 
medium containing 200 mg L −1 ampicillin until the OD600 reached 0.6–7. To induce protein 
overexpression, 500 µM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and the 
cultures were further incubated for 22 h at 18°C. Cells were then harvested via centrifugation 
(4,000 × g for 15 min), and the obtained cell pellet was sonicated using buffer A (50 mM 
Na2HPO4-HCl, pH 7.0). Cell debris was removed via centrifugation (13K × g for 30 min ). 
Purification of all proteins was performed using a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). After 
washing with buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole, bound protein s were eluted with 15 mL 
of buffer B (50 mM Na 2HPO4-HCl, pH 7.0 , 300 mM imidazole ). All procedures were 
conducted at 4°C. Protein quantification was performed using a BioTek™ Epoch microplate 
spectrophotometer and Gen5™ microplate data analysis software.

Differential scanning fluorometry 
 A thermal shift assay was performed to evaluate the thermal stability of IsPETase 
variants via StepOnePlus Real -Time PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein Applied 
Biosystem 1× dye, buffer A, and 5 μg of protein were mixed in a final volume of 20 μl. Signal 
changes reflecting protein denaturation were monitored while the temperature increased from 
25°C to 99°C at a rate of 0.1°C ∙s−1. The melting temperature was measured by generating a 
derivative curve from the fluorescence melting curves of the protein complex with the Applied 
Biosystems dye.  
 
PET sample preparation 
Bottle-derivative PET powder was prepared by pulverizing clear transparent bottles 
using a document crusher and melting the pulverized 0.2 × 1.0-mm flakes at 270°C for 7–8 min 
in a high-temperature oven. Molten PET was instantly chilled and hardened by immersion in a 
water bath set at 4°C. The obtained product was treated with cryo genic grinding (freezing 
milling) again and then sieved using a mesh size of 300 μm to obtain the final bottle-derived 
PET powder.  Transparent and colored post-consumer PET powders produced from PET 
products that had been collected and separated in to transparent and colored forms were 
purchased from Fluent R&C company (Deagu, Republic of Korea; 1 ton of each). Each sample 
was re-ground in a frozen powder dummy after generating chips by re -grinding and extrusion 
at high temperature and high pressure. Each sample was sieved using a mesh size of 300 μm 
and processed in Daehan Industrial Co., Ltd. (Deagu, Republic of Korea).  
 
Crystallinity measurement of PET samples  
 The percentage of crystallinity (Xc) for each PET sample was measured using a 
differential scanning calorimetry instrument (Q2000, TA instrument) . Approximately 5–7 mg

of each powder sample was prepared and equilibrated at 30°C. The sample was temperature 
scanned from 30°C to 300°C at a controlled constant rate (e.g., 10°C∙min−1) with heat -flow 
monitoring to characterize the thermal properties as a function of temperature change. Results 
were plotted as graphs with temperature (°C) on the x-axis and heat flow (W/g) on the y-axis, 
and the percentage of crystallinity was calculated based on the following equation: 
Xc (%) = (∆Hm−∆Hc) / ∆Hf × 100% 
cold crystallization (∆Hc)/melting enthalpy (∆Hm)/heat of fusion (∆Hf) 
PET film from Goodfellow (thickness: 0.25 mm; condition: transparent, amorphous) is known 
to have a crystallinity of 6.1%.27  
 
PET hydrolysis activity measurement 
 The 15g ∙ l−1 bottle-derived PET powder  was soaked in 1000 μl of 50 mM 
glycine/NaOH, pH 8.7, with 500 nM of IsPETase variants. The reaction mixture was incubated 
at 50°C for 3, 6, or 12 h. Then, the reaction was terminated by heating the mixture at 100°C for 
15 min. The remaining substrate was removed from the reaction mixture by filtering with a 
0.22-μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) syringe filter (SFPVDF013022CB, Futecs, Republic 
of Korea). The supernatant was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). To measure PET decomposition in a circulating system, an experimental container 
(350 ml) capable of accommodating a capacity of 50 × the reaction volume (200 ml) was 
prepared. The PET hydrolase reaction was induced on a cellulose dialysis membrane 
(Spectra/Por 2 Trial Kit, 12–14 kD: flat width 25 mm; Repligen, USA), and bottle-derived PET 
powder was used as the substrate. Then, 1 μM of each variant was added to a solution of 50 
(±2) mg of the substrate as bottle-derivative PET powder, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and 1%

(v/v) 1-butanol. Each packaged 4-ml dialysis reaction bag was immersed in 200 ml of 200 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 1% (v/v) 1-butanol. The reaction was performed at 50°C, with shaking 
at 80 rpm in a small shaking incubator (JEIO TECH, Republic of Korea). Samples were 
measured in an external equilibrium solution, and the amount of product was quantitatively 
evaluated using a spectrophotometer. 
 
Analytical methods 
 Samples were analyzed using a C18 column (SunFireTM C18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). 
Mobile phase A was distilled water containing 0.1% ( v/v) formic acid (HPLC grade), and 
mobile phase B was 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in distilled water (HPLC grade). The mobile phase 
gradient was increased from 60 % to 80 % buffer B over 5 min, and then 100%  buffer B was 
flowed for 10 min. The flow rate was set at 1 ml∙min−1. Products were detected using a UV/Vis 
detector (SPD-20A) at 260 nm and analyzed using the CMB-20A system controller (Shimadzu, 
Kyoto, Japan). Calibrations were conducted using 10 levels of rTA (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, 
USA) and MHET (AmBeed, Chicago, USA) in 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 8.7) and BHET 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) in DMSO for blocking self-hydrolysis. 
 
Spectrophotometric assay 
 Quantitative determination of rTA was performed using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer 
(UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). All samples mixed with rTA, MHET, and BHET and then diluted 
to 10% (v/v) with 50 mM Glycine-NaOH (pH 8.7) solution. After adding IsMHETase32 (8 nM), 
the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 3 h or more . For measurement, each sample 
was loaded into a quartz cuvette of the UV spectrophotometer (path length 10 mm, Starna 
Scientific, London, England) and measured by scanning at a wavelength range of 250–360 nm. 
The value obtained at the baseline wavelength (360 nm) was subtracted from that obtained at

the measurement wavelengths (250, 260, and 270 nm) , and the resulting value was input into 
each calibration equation. Calibration was performed by diluting rTA in 50 mM glycine-NaOH 
(pH 8.7) and measuring at eight levels at 250 nm (0.2–2 μM rTA), 260 nm (0.2–2 μM rTA), 
and 270 nm (0.2–2 μM rTA) (Supplementary Fig. 12).  
 
 
Structure determination  
 Purified IsPETase variant proteins were further purified for crystallization via fast-
protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Eluted proteins were exchanged from buffer B into 
buffer A and concentrated at a high concentration (>1.0 mM) using a 10k concentration 
column (Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit). Crystallization was achieved using the 
sitting-drop vapor diffusion method on an MRC crystallization plate (Molecular 
Dimensions). Each 1.0-μl drop of the protein solution was mixed with 1.0 μl of commercially 
available sparse matrix screens, such as Index, PEG ion, I and II (Hampton Research), and 
Wizard Classic, on the plate and then equilibrated with 50 μL of reservoir solution at 20°C. 
The best-quality crystals of the Is-4pC, Is-4pC+A180V , Is-4pC+P181V , Is-8p, Z1-PETase, 
and Z2-PETase variants were found in G4 of Wizard Classic, G4 of Index, A1 of PEG ion I, 
F7 of Index, H7 of PEG ion II, and A11 of PEG ion I, respectively. The highest-quality 
crystals were transferred to a cryo-protectant solution consisting of the well solution with 
20% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals were scintillation-frozen in a nitrogen gas flow at 4°C to obtain 
X-ray diffraction data at an angle of 1°∙s−1 and wavelength of 0.97934 Å. Data were collected 
at the 7A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, Pohang, Republic of Korea) 
using a Quantum 270 CCD detector (ADSC, USA). All X-ray diffraction data were indexed, 
integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 software package.28 Molecular replacement of the 
collected data for all variants was conducted using the CCP429 version of MOLREP,30 with

the deposited IsPETase structure (PDB code 5XJH) used as a search model. Further model 
building to align PDB files with the Fo-Fc map was performed manually using WinCoot29, 
and refinement was performed using CCP4 refmac5.29 All data statistics are summarized in 
Table S3. The final refined models of Is-4pC, Is-4pC+A180V , Is-4pC+P181V , Is-8p, Z1-
PETase, and Z2-PETase were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB codes of 8H5M, 
8H5O, 8H5J, 8H5K, and 8H5L, respectively.31 
 
Heat inactivation experiment 
 Protein heat inactivation was investigated using a p-NPB hydrolysis assay. When p-
NPB is hydrolyzed, butyrate and p-nitrophenolate ion s are produced, and the latter can be 
measured via UV/VIS spectrophotomet ry at 409 nm. IsPETase variants (200 nM IsPETase 
mutant in 200 µl of 50 mM glycine-NaOH [pH 9.0]) were inactivated at 60°C or 70°C (1–36 
h) and then chilled in an ice bath for 10 min. The reaction mixture contained 1% (v/v) Triton 
X-100, 10% MeOH, 50 mM phosphate buffered saline buffer (pH 7.8; Sigma -Aldrich, 
Missouri, USA), and 1 mM p-NPB. IsPETase mutants were added to the reaction mixture to 
initiate reaction. The protein concentration in the reaction mixture was 500 nM, and the final 
volume was adjusted to 500 μL with distilled water. The reaction was monitored for 60 s, and 
10 s of the interval between linear-increasing sections were used as data. Each data point was 
calculated except for the baseline, which was obtained by measuring the self-hydrolysis of p-
NPB. All experiments were performed in triplicate. 
 
Bioreactor system 
 A lab-scale bioreactor (MARDO-PDA, BIOCNS, Republic of Korea) was customized 
to analyze PET depolymerization. Three sets of jars with a capacity of 500 m l were deposited 
into the reactor. A non-contact type temperature sensor was used, and the reactor operated at a

range of 30°C to 80°C. The temperature was regulated using a refrigeration and heating bath 
circulator (RW3-1025, JEIO TECH, Daejeon , Republic of Korea). The pH of the reaction 
solution was measured using a pH electrode (one-gel pH electrode with a digital display in 0.01 
increments). The pH meter was calibrated at two pH levels (4.01 and 7.00). For the reaction, 
2.5 μM of Z1-PETase was added to 150 m l of 10 mM Na 2HPO4-HCl (pH 8.0) in the reactor. 
Samples of transparent and colored post-consumer PET powder were added at a concentration 
of 2.5% (w/v), and the sample and enzyme were mixed with an agitation speed of 200 rpm. 
The reaction solution was maintained at pH 8.0 through buffer titration with 0.3575 N NaOH 
(40%; extra pure grade, Duksan, Republic of Korea). The weight of added NaOH was measured 
using a precision weighting measurement system and a micro-precision scale (EK-410i; AND, 
Seoul, Republic of Korea). Samples were taken at specific time points and then filtered using 
a 0.22-μm PVDF syringe filter (SFPVDF013022CB, Futecs, Korea) to remove  the residual 
PET powder. The obtained samples were diluted with 50 mM Glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) and rTA, 
MHET, and BHET were detected using HPLC. The total amount of the released product was 
calculated, accounting for the amount of 0.3575 N NaOH added during the process.

Figure legends 
Fig. 1. Increased protein yield through β-strand modification. (a) Schematic diagram of the 
relationship between temperature and PET polymer deformability. Abbreviations: Vsp, specific 
volume; rc, crystallization rate of polymer; rdepol, rate of depolymerization; depolM, mesophilic 
depolymerase; depolT, thermophilic d epolymerase. (b) (c) PET hydrolysis activities and the 
TmD values (b) and solubilized protein yields (c) of the wild-type, Is-4p, Is-4pC + P181V , and 
Is-8p variants. The activity was measured at 40°C. All the experiments were performed in 
triplicate and de tected via HPLC,  and the error bars of measuring samples represent the 
sampling standard deviation (n=3). (d) Ramachandran plots of the A180 (blue) and P181 (red) 
residues from Is-4pC, Is-4pC+P181V , and Is-8p. (e) The core structures of Is-4pC (green) and 
Is-4pC+P181V (magenta). The polar β-strand network is shown with dotted lines. (f) The 
hydrophobic core and the variations. The crystal structure of Is-8p is shown with a gray cartoon 
model. The catalytic triad of Is-8p is distinguished with magenta color and their side chains are 
shown with sticks. The mutation points of 4p, SS1, A180V , and P181V are indicated and labeled. 
The two imaginary hemispheres and the hydrophobic core of the protein are shown with light-
blue and yellow circles, respectively.  
 
Fig. 2. Balance- and stability-directed protein engineering. (a) PET hydrolysis activities of 
the mutations added to Is-8p for 6 h at 50°C. (b-d) The TmD values (b), relative activity against 
p-NPB (c), and PET hydrolysis activity (d) of the nine combinatoria l variants of 8p. All the 
experiments were performed in triplicate and the error bars of measuring samples represent the 
sampling standard deviation (n=3).
