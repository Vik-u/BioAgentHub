Abstract
Background Cold ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a multifactorial process detrimental to liver graft function during 
liver transplantation (LT). Although flushing hepatic grafts prior to reperfusion have been well explored, the optimal 
graft rinse solution to prevent cold IR injury remains largely undefined. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 
a new rinse solution combining polyethylene glycol PM 35,000 Da (PEG35) with lactated solution (RLS) could mitigate 
cold IR injury in Wistar rats.
Methods Livers were isolated, preserved for 24 h and flushed immediately before ex vivo reperfusion with either RLS 
or PEG35-enriched RLS. Liver injury, graft function, energy balance, autophagy, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory 
response were assessed.
Results Flushing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in decreased transaminase levels after cold 
ischemia. The improved graft function was evidenced by increased bile flow, enhanced BSP clearance, and reduced 
vascular resistance in these flushed grafts. Phospho-AMPK protein expression, as well as LC3B gene and protein 
expression were significantly increased compared to those unflushed and flushed only with RLS. PEG35-enriched RLS 
also maintained the oxidative state, as indicated by reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased MDA 
concentration. Additionally, this graft rinse solution down-regulated the inflammatory response by inhibiting the 
expression of genes involved in the HMGB-1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway.
Conclusion These data strongly suggest that rinsing liver grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS prior to reperfusion 
represents a simple and cost-effective strategy to enhance liver functional recovery after cold IR injury. This approach 
could serve as a viable alternative to RLS in clinical applications, highlighting the need for further research to explore 
its broader implications.

Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) stands as the gold stan -
dard treatment for end-stage liver disease [ 1]. LT pro -
cess involves subjecting the donated graft to a period of 
cold ischemia by preserving it in a static cold preserva -
tion solution [ 2]. During this ischemic phase, anaerobic 
metabolism occurs, leading to energy depletion within 
the graft. Consequently, dysfunction of ATP-dependent 
pumps occurs, disrupting ion homeostasis, cellular swell -
ing, acidosis, and cytoskeletal disorganization. Upon 
reperfusion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
induces oxidative stress, initiating a cascade of inflamma-
tory responses that ultimately lead to cell death. This irre-
versible damage is known as cold ischemia-reperfusion 
(IR) injury, a significant risk factor for poor and non-graft 
function [3–6].
To mitigate the impact of cold IR injury and improve 
LT outcomes, hypothermic preservation has been devel -
oped [7]. However, this procedure has drawbacks, includ-
ing toxic metabolic waste accumulation during cold 
ischemia [8]. In an effort to reduce complications during 
reperfusion, surgeons have explored graft rinsing before 
revascularization [ 9]. Several studies support this novel 
approach, indicating that pre-reperfusion graft rinsing 
reduces post-reperfusion damage [10, 11]. Despite its sig-
nificance, limited clinical research has been conducted 
on the use of rinsing solutions for graft rescue and con -
ditioning. In clinical practice, Ringer’s lactate solution 
(RLS), a crystalloid solution devoid of additives and buff -
ering capacity, is commonly used for intraoperative vol -
ume replacement [12]. Although RLS was not specifically 
designed to mitigate cold IR injury, it has been shown to 
improve graft survival and reduce microvascular injury 
when used for graft flushing prior to reperfusion [ 13]. 
However, Adam et al. proposed a more effective alterna -
tive to RLS, suggesting that rinsing liver transplants with 
a macromolecular albumin solution offers better protec -
tion against reperfusion damage [9]. Attempts to enhance 
graft rinse solutions by incorporating specific pharma -
cological agents led to the emergence of Carolina rinse 
solution, showing promise in experimental conditions 
[14]. However, its complex composition and the inclusion 
of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), causing blood cell aggrega -
tion [15], hindered its adoption in routine clinical prac -
tice. Other studies explored the effects of rinsing grafts 
with Normosol-1 and plasmalyte-A solutions show -
ing improvements in liver function and hepatocellular 
damage, respectively [ 16, 17]. Yet, substantial improve -
ments in post-transplant outcomes were not consistently 
observed [ 18]. A novel rinse solution, called the “Base 
Solution” , containing polyethylene glycol-35 kDa (PEG35) 
was developed by Zaouali et al., providing strong evi -
dence of PEG35’s role in preserving mitochondrial integ -
rity, reducing oxidative stress, and inflammation [ 19]. 
However, this graft rinse solution remains in experi -
mental phase and its clinical validation is essential. In a 
recent study, hydrogen rinse solution was found effective 
in reducing cold IR injury yet concerns about hydrogen’s 
limited solubility and flammability limited its clinical 
utility [20]. Numerous solutions have been employed for 
graft rinsing; however, the optimal composition remains 
uncertain.
Building upon the established benefits of PEG35 in 
mitigating IR injury, along with the straightforward com -
position and the clinical availability of RLS, this study 
introduces PEG35 into RLS for the first time as a flush -
ing solution for liver grafts before reperfusion. The aim of 
this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel 
flushing solution in reducing the susceptibility of rat liver 
grafts to cold IR injury.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 250 g were 
raised in the animal facility at the Faculty of Pharmacy, 
Monastir, Tunisia. The rats were provided with free 
access to food and water and were maintained under 
standard conditions (temperature, humidity and 12/12 h 
of light/dark cycle). Ethical approval was obtained from 
the Research Ethics Committee for Life and Health 
Sciences at the Higher Institute of Biotechnology of 
Monastir under the reference CER-SVS/ISBM 05/2020. 
All experimental procedures were carried out in accor -
dance with experimental ethics.
Liver harvesting and perfusion
Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection 
of 24% urethane (0.5  ml/100  g of body weight) before 
undergoing a median xypho-pubic and transverse bi-
subcostal laparotomy. A Venocath 18 G catheter was 
inserted into the common bile duct. Following the dissec-
tion of the aorta, vena cava, and portal vein as outlined in 
a prior study [ 21], a Venocath 16 G catheter was placed 
in the aorta for arterial liver lavage, and a Venocath 14 
G catheter was inserted into the portal vein for complete 
liver wash with cooled Histidine-tryptophan-ketogluta -
rate (HTK) preservation solution. At the beginning of the 
liver washing procedure, the inferior and suprahepatic 
vena cava were promptly incised to allow fluid drainage. 
Once the washing process was completed, the livers were 
immediately harvested and stored in HTK preservation 
solution at 4 °C for 24 h. The rats, still under anesthesia, 
were euthanized through exsanguination.
After the cold ischemia preservation period, the iso -
lated liver grafts underwent ex vivo reperfusion at 37 °C 
in a closed circuit through the portal vein for 120  min. 
The livers were perfused with a solution containing 
Page 3 of 13
Jeddou et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology           (2025) 26:70 
Krebs-Heinseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4), 5% albu -
min, and a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2.
Following ex vivo normothermic reperfusion, the liver 
tissue was divided into three segments. One segment 
was fixed in 10% formalin for subsequent histological 
and immunofluorescence analysis. Another segment was 
stored in RNA Later for transcriptome analysis, while the 
remaining segment was frozen at -80 °C for biochemical 
assessments.
Experimental groups
The experimental groups were as follows (n = 7):
Group 1 (sham):  The livers were promptly washed out 
and harvested, then immediately, subjected to ex vivo per-
fusion without undergoing cold preservation.
Group 2 (cold IR): Following a 24-h period of cold isch -
emia in HTK preservation solution, the liver underwent 
ex vivo reperfusion without any rinsing procedure.
Group 3 (RLS):  Similar to the cold IR group, but in this 
case, the livers were rinsed with 50  ml of RLS before 
undergoing a 120-min ex vivo reperfusion at 37 °C. The 
RLS solution was administered through the portal vein at 
room temperature.
Group 4 (RLS + PEG35): Similar to the RLS group, but 
the livers were rinsed with 50  ml of RLS enriched with 
5 g/L of PEG35 [19] at room temperature.
Liver injury and function
Liver transaminase assay
Liver cytolysis was evaluated by assessing transaminase 
activity [22], following 120 min of ex vivo normothermic 
perfusion. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) activities in portal vein effluents 
were determined using Biomaghreb kits (Tunisia), with 
results quantified in U/L.
Bile output
Liver function was assessed by measuring cumulative bile 
production during a 120-min normothermic perfusion 
[23]. Bile was collected through the cannulated bile duct, 
and its volume was determined by weighing. Bile flow 
was quantified as µL/g liver/120 min.
Bromosulfophthalein clearance
Hepatic clearance involved the addition of 1 mg of bro -
mosulfophthalein (BSP , Sigma Aldrich) to the Krebs-
Heinseleit medium 30 min after initiating perfusion. The 
percentage of BSP excreted in bile was then calculated 
based on the administered dose of BSP . BSP concen -
tration in both the perfusate and bile was measured at 
580 nm. BSP clearance was determined as a percentage of 
perfusate content (t120bile / t30perfusate * 100) [24].
Vascular resistance
The portal pressure was maintained constant at 12 
mmHg throughout the ex vivo perfusion time. Vascular 
resistance was calculated as the ratio of portal pressure 
to perfusion flow. Vascular resistance was expressed in 
mmHg.min.g.ml⁻¹, as previously reported [25].
Antioxidant enzymes activities measurement
The total activity of superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD 
and Mn SOD) was evaluated using the method outlined 
by Marklund et al. [ 26]. This assay assesses the capac -
ity of SOD to inhibit the autoxidation of pyrogallol, with 
SOD activity measured at 420 nm and expressed as U/mg 
protein. Catalase activity (CAT) was determined follow -
ing the procedure described by Claiborne et al. [ 27]. This 
method involves monitoring the breakdown of hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2), with CAT activity measured at 240 nm 
and expressed as µmol of H 2O2 decomposed/min/
mg protein. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was 
assessed by according to the method introduced by Flohe 
et al. [28]. GPx activity was determined by measuring the 
oxidation of glutathione (GSH) into glutathione disulfide 
(GSSG) at 412  nm and expressed as µmoL of oxidized 
GSH/min/mg protein.
Malondialdehyde assay
Lipid peroxidation was assessed in the hepatic tissues by 
the determination of malondialdehyde (MDA) formation 
with the reaction at 530  nm [ 24]. It was represented as 
nmol/mg of protein.
Histological analyses
Liver specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded 
in paraffin, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) (RAL-Diagnostics). Images were captured using 
a Leica DFC320 R2 digital camera. Damage assessment 
involved counting morphological changes in randomly 
selected microscopic fields from each group’s samples, 
following the classification by t’Hart et al. [ 29]: (1) Nor -
mal rectangular form, (2) rounder hepatocytes with 
larger sinusoidal spaces, (3) vacuolization, (4) nuclear 
pyknosis, and (5) necrosis.
Immunofluorescence analysis of AMPK and LC3 protein 
expression
Paraffin-embedded liver sections were permeabilized 
with 1% Triton X-100 for 30  min, and blocked with 
normal goat serum for 1  h at 37  °C. Subsequently, tis -
sue samples were incubated overnight at 4  °C with rab -
bit anti Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) (1:100, cell signalling, #2535), rabbit 
Page 4 of 13
Jeddou et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology           (2025) 26:70 
anti-microtubule-associated proteins1A/1B light chain 
3B (LC3B) (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, #L7543). Following 
this, a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated 
donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen, 
#A32731), were applied for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence of 
light. Microscopic analysis and image capture were con -
ducted using a Carl Zeiss system.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from rat livers with TRItidy-G 
reagent (AppliChem, TRItidy G™, Italy), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using 
the M-MLV RT enzyme kit according to the manufac -
turer’s protocol ((MMLV, Thermoscientific Invitrogen™, 
France). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed using StepOne Software 
from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The 2 − (ΔΔCT)  method, as 
described by Livak et al. in 2013, was employed to deter -
mine relative gene expression, with β-actin serving as the 
reference gene. This analysis was conducted using SYBR® 
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied BiosystemsTM) and the 
primers outlined in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as means ± SD. Statistical analyses 
were conducted using one-way ANOVA, followed by 
Tukey post hoc test GraphPad software (version Prism 
8.4.2). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Basic Intensity Quantification was performed using 
Image J [30].
Results
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS preserves 
cell integrity
The assessment of hepatocellular damage, utilizing liver 
enzymes ALT and AST, revealed a significant increase in 
perfusate ALT and AST levels in rats subjected to Cold 
IR as compared to the sham group (Fig. 1A and B). Flush-
ing the grafts with RLS did not significantly affect ALT 
and AST levels compared to the Cold IR group. However, 
rinsing livers with PEG35-enriched RLS before reper -
fusion resulted in a significant reduction in ALT levels 
compared to both the Cold IR and RLS groups, and a 
decrease in AST levels compared to the Cold IR group.
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS 
ameliorates hepatic function
Liver function assessment included measurement of 
bile production, vascular resistance and BSP clearance. 
As depicted in Fig.  2A, liver grafts exposed to Cold IR 
exhibited a significant reduction in bile production com -
pared to the sham group. No significant difference was 
observed between livers subjected to Cold IR and those 
rinsed with RLS alone. However, rinsing grafts with RLS-
enriched PEG35 resulted in a significant enhancement 
in bile production compared to both Cold IR and RLS 
groups.

In Fig.  2B, liver grafts exposed to Cold IR significantly 
reduced hepatic BSP clearance compared to sham group. 
Rinsing the livers with RLS alone had no significant effect 
on BSP clearance compared with the Cold IR group. In 
contrast, rinsing grafts with PEG35 enriched with RLS 
increased biliary clearance of BSP compared with the 
Cold IR group.
According to Fig.  2C, vascular resistance was signifi -
cantly increased in the Cold IR compared to the sham 
group. Compared to the Cold IR group, rinsing grafts 
with RLS alone significantly decreased vascular resis -
tance. However, the most important reduction in vascu -
lar resistance was shown when the grafts were flushed 
with RLS-enriched PEG35 compared to the Cold IR and 
RLS groups.
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS maintains 
hepatic architecture
As shown in Fig.  3A and B, histological examination 
revealed significant damage in the Cold IR group, char -
acterized by vacuolization, necrosis, and disintegration 
of liver architecture. The RLS group displayed sinusoidal 
dilatation, while this effect was significantly mitigated in 
the RLS group enriched with PEG35.
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS improves 
hepatic energy balance
Fluorescence intensity associated with phospho-AMPK 
protein expression showed a significantly reduced level in 
the Cold IR group compared to the sham group. Rinsing 
with RLS alone had no significant effect, while PEG35-
enriched RLS improved energy balance, evidenced by a 
significant increase in phosphor-AMPK fluorescence 
intensity compared to both groups (Fig. 4).
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS enhances 
autophagy
Autophagy marker (LC-3) gene and protein expression 
decreased in livers subjected to Cold IR. Rinsing with 
RLS alone showed no significant difference, but PEG35-
enriched RLS induced substantial LC3 gene and protein 
expression compared to other groups (Fig. 5A, B and C).
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS protects 
against oxidative damage
Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GPx, CAT) were 
significantly higher in livers exposed to Cold IR, reduced 
by RLS flushing, and significantly decreased with PEG35-
enriched RLS compared to Cold IR and RLS groups 
(Fig.  6A, B, C). Enzymatic antioxidant gene expressions 
(SOD, GPx, CAT) followed a similar profile (Fig.  6D, E,

F), and MDA concentrations were significantly reduced 
with PEG35-enriched RLS compared to the Cold IR 
group (Fig. 6G).
Rinsing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS attenuates 
cold ischemia-induced inflammation
Inflammation-related gene expressions, including High 
Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB-1), Nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF-kB) and Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), 
were highest in livers subjected to Cold IR in comparison 
to Sham group. HMGB-1 and NF-kB gene expressions 
were significantly reduced by RLS flushing compared to 
the cold IR group, whereas TNF-α expression showed 
no significant reduction. Rinsing grafts with PEG35-
enriched RLS further decreased these gene expressions 
compared to both the Cold IR and RLS groups (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Although LT techniques are becoming more standard -
ized, there are still ongoing controversies surrounding 
various aspects of the procedure [ 31]. The rinsing of 
grafts after cold preservation has emerged as a potential 
factor influencing liver function outcomes after reper -
fusion. In this study, we explored the effects of a novel 
graft rinse solution combining RLS with PEG35. Using 
an ex vivo perfusion model, we found that PEG35 sup -
plementation to RLS for normothermic liver rinse after 
hypothermic preservation effectively maintained mem -
brane integrity, preserved energy metabolism, promoted 
autophagy, alleviated oxidative stress, and reduced 
inflammation.
The intricate pathophysiology of cold IR injury involves 
significant metabolic and structural changes leading to 
substantial tissue damage [ 32, 33]. In this regard, our 
findings revealed that exposure to cold ischemia in HTK 
solution increased the release of ALT/AST in the perfus -
ate compared to the sham group. Notably, rinsing liver 
grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in a greater 
reduction in transaminase levels compared to RLS alone, 
suggesting a lower degree of hepatocyte cytolysis. The 
histological study corroborates these findings, revealing 
less damages in hepatic grafts rinsed with this rinse solu -
tion compared to other groups. Additionally, they under -
score the critical role of incorporating PEG in effectively 
protecting hepatocytes, maintaining their membrane 
integrity, and restoring their inherent viability and func -
tionality [34, 35].
Monitoring bile production is widely accepted as a 
reliable parameter for assessing the integrity and energy 
status of ex vivo perfused livers [ 36]. Preservation of 
liver grafts in HTK solution resulted in decreased bile 
flow compared to the sham group. Conversely, flushing 
grafts with normothermic RLS prior to ex vivo reperfu -
sion improved biliary output, consistent with previous 
Fig. 4 PEG35-enriched RLS prevents liver energy metabolism. Phosphory-
lated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase protein (AMPK) 
expression by immunofluorescence (original magnification ×40, ×100) (A) 
and AMPK signal intensity ( B) was evaluated in livers harvested from un -
treated rats and immediately submitted to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion 
(Sham), in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and submitted 
to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Cold IR), in livers subjected to cold isch-
emia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution before under-
going a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS) and in livers subjected to cold 
ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution enriched 
with PEG35 at 5 g/L before undergoing a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion 
(RLS + PEG35). Data were expressed as means ± SD (n = 8 for each group).

research suggesting that warm RLS may mitigate the 
effect of cold IR injury [ 37]. Notably, flushing grafts 
with PEG35-enriched RLS demonstrated a significant 
improvement in bile production after 24 h of cold isch -
emia compared to RLS group. This improvement, which 
goes hand in hand with the enhancement in BSP hepatic 
clearance noted after rinsing grafts with this PEG35-
enriched RLS, is associated with the preservation of liver 
function. These findings provide further validation of the 
beneficial effects of the flushing solution on liver function 
[19].
Elevation in post-transplant vascular resistance is asso -
ciated with an increased incidence of primary graft dys -
function and non-function in LT [ 38]. Liver grafts stored 
in HTK solution exhibited higher vascular resistance 
than those of the sham group in our study. Flushing the 
liver grafts with RLS decreased vascular resistance dur -
ing reperfusion compared to the Cold IR group. Impor -
tantly, flushing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS 
improved the reduction in vascular resistance compared 
to RLS alone. This improvement in microvascular func -
tion may be attributed to the beneficial effects of the 
washing step as well as the local effects of PEG35 on 
endothelial cells, including enhanced nitric oxide pro -
duction and maintenance of colloidal oncotic pressure 
[39–41].
To investigate the mechanism by which pre-reperfu -
sion rinsing of grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS mitigates 
cold IR injury, our study focused on examining the role 
of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme 
involved in the regulation of autophagy processes, oxida -
tive stress, and inflammation. It plays a significant role

fluorescence (original magnification ×400), LC3 signal intensity (B) and LC3 mRNA expression (C) were evaluated in livers harvested from untreated rats 
and immediately submitted to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Sham), in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and submitted to 120 min of ex 
vivo reperfusion (Cold IR), in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution before undergoing a 120-min of 
ex vivo reperfusion (RLS) and in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution enriched with PEG35 at 5 g/L 
before undergoing a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS + PEG35). Data were expressed as means ± SD (n = 8 for each group). aP < 0.05 vs. Sham; bP < 0.05 
vs. Cold IR; cP < 0.05 vs. RLS

in maintaining metabolic balance and counteracting the 
depletion of ATP that occurs during cold IR injury [ 42, 
43]. Our findings revealed a decrease in AMPK protein 
level after livers preservation in HTK solution compared 
to the sham group. However, the addition of PEG35 to 
RLS led to an improvement in AMPK phosphorylation. 
Activation of AMPK is known to stimulate catabolic 
pathways that generate ATP and inhibit anabolic path -
ways that could deplete ATP [ 44]. Rinsing liver grafts 
with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in increased AMPK 
Fig. 6 PEG35-enriched RLS prevents oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase ( A, SOD), glutathione per-
oxidase (B, GPX), catalase (C, CAT) activities, their mRNA expression (D, SOD; E, GPX and F, CAT respectively) and Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels 
(G) were measured in livers harvested from untreated rats and immediately submitted to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Sham), in livers subjected to 
cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and submitted to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Cold IR), in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed 
with Ringer’s lactate solution before undergoing a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS) and in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed 
with Ringer’s lactate solution enriched with PEG35 at 5 g/L before undergoing a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS + PEG35). Data were expressed as 
means ± SD (n = 8 for each group). aP < 0.05 vs. Sham; bP < 0.05 vs. Cold IR; cP < 0.05 vs. RLS

phosphorylation, as well as enhanced gene and protein 
expression of LC3B, highlighting PEG35’s potential to 
activate AMPK and trigger cytoprotective autophagy, 
which aids in the elimination of defective mitochondria 
[45]. Therefore, our results suggest that the beneficial 
effects of pre-reperfusion rinsing with PEG35-enriched 
RLS in attenuating cold IR injury may be mediated, at 
least in part, through the activation of AMPK and the 
induction of cytoprotective autophagy mechanisms 
aimed at preserving liver function [46].
Oxidative stress significantly impacts the integrity 
and function of liver grafts after cold IR injury [ 25]. 
In response, the organ activates intracellular biologi -
cal defense mechanisms, involving both enzymatic and 
non-enzymatic antioxidants [ 47]. Our results revealed 
remarkable antioxidants enzymatic activity in liver 
grafts subjected to cold IR injury without rinsing. Rins -
ing liver grafts with RLS significantly decreased anti -
oxidant enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation 
compared to reperfused grafts without rinsing. The most 
relevant reduction in these enzymatic activities was 
observed following rinsing grafts with PEG35-enriched 
RLS compared to RLS. This result may be related to 
PEG35’s ability to directly eliminate ROS and activate 
AMPK, inhibiting ROS production [ 48, 49]. Additionally, 
PEG35’s protective effects may be attributed to its abil -
ity to maintain mitochondrial integrity and enhance key 
mitochondrial biomarkers [50].
HMGB-1 modulation by AMPK is known to play a 
crucial role in inflammation processes [ 51]. Our results 
showed overexpression of HMGB-1 genes in livers 
exposed to liver preservation in HTK without rinsing 
compared to the sham group. Rinsing liver grafts with 
RLS decreased the expression levels of inflammation-
related genes, including TLR-4, NF-kB, and TNF-α, com-
pared to Cold IR group. This reduction in inflammation 
was further pronounced when grafts were rinsed with 
PEG35-enriched RLS compared to the RLS group. PEG35 
has been shown to reduce leukocyte infiltration and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by activating AMPK, 
Fig. 7 PEG35-enriched RLS attenuates inflammatory response. Gene expression of high mobility group box − 1 (HMGB-1, A), Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
κB, B) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in liver tissue by RT-PCR were assessed in livers harvested from untreated rats and immediately submitted 
to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Sham), in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and submitted to 120 min of ex vivo reperfusion (Cold IR), in 
livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution before undergoing a 120-min of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS) and 
in livers subjected to cold ischemia for 24 h at 4 °C and rinsed with Ringer’s lactate solution enriched with PEG35 at 5 g/L before undergoing a 120-min 
of ex vivo reperfusion (RLS + PEG35). Data were expressed as means ± SD (n = 8 for each group). aP < 0.05 vs. Sham; bP < 0.05 vs. Cold IR; cP < 0.05 vs. RLS

contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects [ 52, 53]. 
These findings came in agreement with Ferrero-Andres A 
who reported that PEG35 could reduce leukocyte infiltra-
tion and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by activating 
AMPK, contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects [53]. 
Taken together, our research shows that AMPK activa -
tion could be the primary mechanism by which the use 
of PEG35-enriched RLS solution in liver graft rinsing 
produces its effects. These findings provide evidence sup-
porting the benefits of using a PEG35-enriched rinsing 
solution in LT to reduce cold IR injury (Fig. 8).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that adding PEG35 
to RLS protects cellular integrity, reduces oxidative 
stress, and modulates key processes such as inflammation 
and autophagy. These findings highlight the potential of 
PEG35-enriched RLS as a novel and effective strategy to 
counteract cold IR injury, a critical factor in LT, and pave 
the way for future applications in clinical practice.
