Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic,
and synthesized from the central metabolite acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA synthesis
from glucose presents low atomic economy due to the release of CO 2 in pyruvate
decarboxylation. As ethanol and acetate can be converted into acetyl-CoA directly, they
were used as carbon source for PHB production in this study. The reductase mutant
AdhE A267T/E568K was introduced into Escherichia colito enable growth on ethanol,
and acetate utilization was improved by overexpression of acetyl-CoA synthetase ACS.
Comparison of the PHB production using glucose, ethanol or acetate as sole carbon
source showed that the production and yield from ethanol was much higher than
those from glucose and acetate, and metabolome analysis revealed the differences in
metabolism of glucose, ethanol and acetate. Furthermore, other acetyl-CoA derived
chemicals including 3-hydroxypropionate and phloroglucinol were produced from those
three feedstocks, and similar results were achieved, suggesting that ethanol could be a
suitable carbon source for the production of acetyl-CoA derivatives.

INTRODUCTION
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) was discovered by Lemoigne in 1926 as an intracellular carbon-
and energy-storage material, and has attracted much industrial attention as a biodegradable
and biocompatible thermoplastic (Chen, 2009). PHB is the most representative homopolymer
in polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family, and suitable for applications in packaging, medicine,
pharmacy, and food ﬁelds. Generally speaking, this polymer is synthesized by polymerization of
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA catalyzed by PHA synthase PhaC, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is produced
from two acetyl-CoA molecules by β-ketothiolase PhaA and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase PhaB
(Figure 1A ). In PHB-producing strain Cupriavidus necator (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus or
Ralstonia eutropha), genes encoding these three enzymes are arranged as a cluster phaCAB
(Steinbuchel and Schlegel, 1991), which has been cloned and expression in Escherichia coli
leading to successful PHB production in the engineered E. coli strains (Zhang et al., 2015;
Wu et al., 2016a,b).

Acetyl-CoA is a fundamental metabolite in central metabolic
pathways of E. coli, and also a precursor for biosynthesis of large
number of industrial chemicals and natural products including
PHB (Martin et al., 2003; Meng et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016).
The most common metabolic route for acetyl-CoA synthesis in
E. coliis the glycolysis pathway coupled with decarboxylation of
pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase (Bates et al., 1977). Through
this pathway, each mol of glucose is converted into 2 mol of
acetyl-CoA with generation of 4 mol of NADH, 2 mol of ATP and
2 mol of CO2 (Figure 1B). The release of CO2 lowers the atomic
economy of targeted chemical biosynthetic pathway, leading to
decrease of theoretical production yield, titer and productivity
(Chae et al., 2017).
Acetate and ethanol are both ordinary and inexpensive
commodity chemicals, which can be produced either biologically
or chemically. Acetate is manufactured mainly from methanol
and carbon monoxide in the presence of rhodium-based catalyst
except that a small section used in food industry is produced
by fermentation (Zhou and Qian, 2010). Besides fermentation

of lignocellulosic biomass (Sun and Cheng, 2002), ethanol can
also be produced from coal by chemical methods. There are
three ethanol-producing routes from coal with syngas (Pan
et al., 2007), acetate (McGinnis, 1983), and dimethyl ether
(Liu et al., 2013) as intermediate, respectively, which were all
applied in industrial scale. The capacity of ethanol production
from coal has exceeded 2 million tons per year in China.
Acetate and ethanol can be directly converted into acetyl-
CoA by microorganism, and could be considered as alternative
substrates for production of acetyl-CoA with high atomic
economy, and then production of acetyl-CoA derived chemicals.
In E. coli, acetyl-CoA is produced from acetate via two diﬀerent
pathways, AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) catalyzing
the higher-eﬃcient pathway and phsphotransacetylase/acetate
kinase (Pta-AckA) catalyzing the lower-eﬃcient pathway (Wolfe,
2005). In both pathways, ATP is consumed for the production
of acetyl-CoA from acetate, and no reducing power is produced
during this process ( Figure 1B), indicating that extra acetate is
demanded to generate ATP and reducing power when acetate is
used as sole carbon source. Previously, we have accomplished
the production of phloroglucinol (PG) and mevalonate from
acetate in recombinant E. coli with ACS overexpression
(Xu et al., 2017, 2018).

Sun et al. Carbon Sources for PHB Production
E. coli possesses a bifunctional reductase AdhE, which
catalyzes the two-step reduction of acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde
and then to ethanol during anaerobic growth (Kessler et al.,
1991). Although both reactions catalyzed by AdhE are reversible,
E. coli cannot grow aerobically on ethanol as the sole carbon
source due to the insuﬃciency of adhE expression (Chen
and Lin, 1991) and the susceptibility of AdhE protein to
metal-catalyzed oxidation (Tamarit et al., 1998). Further study
revealed an AdhE A267T/E568K mutant with acquired and
improved aerobic growth ability on ethanol when overexpressed
in E. coli (Membrillo-Hernandez et al., 2000), suggesting that
this AdhE mutant can convert ethanol into acetyl-CoA eﬃciently
and aerobically. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 17933 grows
aerobically with ethanol as sole carbon source, and encodes
an unusual quinoprotein-dependent ethanol oxidizing system
ExaABC, which catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetate
(Figure 1B ; Diehl et al., 1998; Schobert and Gorisch, 1999).
Although the conversion of ethanol to acetyl-CoA through both
routes present a carbon recovery of 100%, the pathway employing
AdhE A267T/E568K mutant produces more NADH, and does
not require energy supply.
To produce PHB from ethanol and acetate, we constructed
an engineered E. colistrain growing with ethanol as sole carbon
source by introduction of AdhE A267T/E568K mutant, and
improved the acetate utilization by overexpression of ACS.
Comparison of the PHB production using glucose, ethanol or
acetate as sole carbon source showed that the production and
yield from ethanol was much higher than those from glucose
and acetate. Furthermore, other acetyl-CoA derived chemicals
including 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and PG were produced
from those three feedstocks, suggesting that ethanol is a suitable
carbon source for the production of acetyl-CoA derivatives.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids
Construction
All bacterial strains, plasmids and primers used in this study
were listed in Table 1 . The plasmids pACYCDuet- adhE and
pACYCDuet-acs were constructed by inserting the adhE gene
(accession No. AP_001865.1) and the acs gene (accession No.
AP_004570.1) from E. coli into pACYCDuet1, respectively. The
plasmid pACYCDuet-adhEmut was constructed using Fast Site-
Directed Mutagenesis Kit (TIANGEN). The dnaKJ gene from
E. coli and POS5 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
ampliﬁed and inserted between the NotI and NdeI sites of
the plasmid pACYCDuet- adhEmut to generate pACYCDuet-
adhEmut-dnaKJ and pACYCDuet-adhEmut-POS5, respectively.
Protein Expression and Gel
Electrophoresis Analysis
For the expression of recombinant proteins, single colonies of
E. coli W3110 harboring recombinant plasmids were used to
inoculate Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing appropriate
antibiotics and grown at 37◦C overnight. The culture was diluted
1:100 into fresh LB medium and incubated under the same
conditions. When the OD 600 reached about 0.6, the protein
expression was induced by 100 µM IPTG and growth was
continued for 12 h at 30◦C. Cells were collected by centrifugation
and suspended in 100 µL 1 ×SDS sample buﬀer, heated at 100◦C
for 10 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Shaking Flask Cultivation
Shaking ﬂask experiments were carried out in triplicate in 250 mL
ﬂasks containing 50 mL medium with appropriate antibiotics. For
the production of PG and PHB, the medium contains 9.8 g/L
K2HPO4·3H2O, 2.1 g/L C6H8O7·H2O, 0.3 g/L ammonium ferric
citrate, 3 g/L (NH4)2SO4. For the production of 3HP , the medium
contains 14 g/L K 2HPO4·3H2O, 5.2 g/L KH 2PO4, 1 g/L NaCl,
1 g/L NH4Cl, 0.25 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2 g/L yeast extract. E. coli
strains were grown overnight at 37 ◦C with shaking in LB broth,
and then 1:50 diluted into 50 mL minimal medium supplemented
with corresponding carbon sources. When the OD 600 reached
about 0.6, 100 µM IPTG and 1 g/L L-arabinose was added and
the strains are further incubated 48 h at 30◦C. Samples were taken
out to determine the OD600, the concentrations of PHB, 3HP , PG,
and residual carbon sources.
Fed-Batch Fermentation of PHB
Fed-batch cultures were performed in a 3-L fermenter (Applikon
Biotechnology, Netherlands) containing 2 L of minimal medium
as described above. The strain Q3135 was grown in 150 mL
LB broth overnight, and transferred into the fermenter. The
temperature was 30◦C, the pH was 7.0 and the dissolved oxygen
was maintained at 5% saturation. The feeding medium was 50%
(w/v) ethanol. The AdhEmut expression was induced at OD600 ∼
3 by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG, and PHB production was started
at OD600 ∼10 by adding 2 g/L arabinose.
CDW and PHB Content Analysis
E. coli cells were harvested with centrifugation at 5,000 ×g
for 15 min, and washed with distilled water twice. To
determine CDW, cell pellets were lyophilized, and the CDW was
gravimetrically determined. PHB was extracted from lyophilized
cells with hot chloroform in a Soxhlet apparatus, and precipitated
by icecold ethanol as described (Brandl et al., 1988).
Quantiﬁcation of 3HP, PG, Ethanol,
Acetate, and Glucose
Concentrations of 3HP , ethanol, acetate and glucose in medium
were determined using an Agilent 1200 Inﬁnity HPLC system
equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
United States) column (300 ×7.8 mm). The concentration of
PG was determined using the colorimetric reaction between
cinnamaldehyde and PG as previously described (Xu et al., 2017).
Metabolite Measurements
Metabolites were extracted from seven individual bacteria
samples. Bacteria samples were taken 200 µL, then added 800 µL
pre-cooled methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), and mixed in vortex.
After sonication for 20 min on ice, the mix was stored at

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Tolerance of E. colito Ethanol and
Acetate
Ethanol usually shows antimicrobial activity at high
concentration, and acetate represses the growth rate and
maximum cell density of E. coli (Liu et al., 2015). To ﬁgure out
appropriate concentrations of ethanol and acetate as carbon
source, they were added into minimal medium containing
10 g/L glucose at a series of concentrations from 1 to 20 g/L,
respectively. As shown in Figure 2, addition of ethanol slightly
slowed the growth, but did not aﬀect maximum cell density of
E. coliW3110 wild-type strain, as well as acetate at concentrations
of 1 and 2 g/L. However, acetate at concentrations of 5–15 g/L
severely retarded E. coli growth, and 20 g/L acetate almost
inhibited bacterial growth. As E. coli can catabolize acetate
naturally, the maximum cell density with addition of 5–15 g/L
acetate was higher than that at control conditions. Therefore, the
concentration of ethanol was ﬁxed at 10 g/L, and 2 g/L acetate
was supplied at the beginning of cultivation with follow-up
addition when exhausted.
Construction of E. coliStrain Growing on
Ethanol
As mentioned above, two systems, E. coli AdhE mutant and
P. aeruginosaExaABC, can support bacterial growth on ethanol
as sole carbon source ( Figure 1B ). As the route employing
AdhE mutant has some advantages like shorter pathway, more
NADH production and no energy requirement, it was chosen
to construct engineered E. coli strain which can grow using
ethanol as sole carbon source. The gene encoding AdhE
A267T/E568K mutant was cloned into the vector pACYCDuet-1
under the IPTG-inducible promoter Plac1−6 (Liu et al., 2004), and
transformed into E. coliW3110 strain, along with empty vector,
to generate strains Q3092 and Q3352, respectively. When grown
in LB broth and induced by IPTG, AdhE mutant protein was
observed as distinct band with the expected molecular weight on
SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A).
Then, these two strains were inoculated into minimal medium
supplemented with 10 g/L ethanol, but neither could grow under
this condition, implying that overexpression of heterologous
gene at beginning of cultivation might impair the cell growth
seriously. So, 1 g/L glucose was added into the medium, and
transcription of adhEmut gene was initiated at an OD 600 of 0.6.
After 57 h cultivation in shaking ﬂask, expression of AdhE mutant
signiﬁcantly increased the cell density, up to 6.7-time higher than
the strain carrying empty vector ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that
appropriate expression of AdhE double mutant is eﬃcient to
support E. coligrowth on ethanol.
Production of PHB From Ethanol
To produce PHB from ethanol, the plasmid pBAD-Ae-pha
carrying phaCAB operon of C. necator (Aldor and Keasling,
2001) was transformed into strains Q3352 and Q3092 to generate
Q3095 and Q3094, respectively. Then, these two strains were
grown in minimal medium containing 1 g/L glucose and 10 g/L
ethanol, and expression of adhEmut and phaCAB was initiated
by addition of IPTG and L-arabinose, respectively. During the
cultivation process, the OD600 and residual ethanol concentration
in medium were measured.
As shown in Figure 4A , the ﬁnal OD 600 of Q3094 strain
carrying AdhE mutant was much higher than that of the
control strain Q3095 carrying empty vector. Growth of Q3094
strain depleted all ethanol in the medium, however, the ethanol
concentration in Q3095 culture decreased slightly, similar with
that of medium without inoculation but incubated at 37 ◦C
(Figure 4B). After 54 h cultivation, the strain Q3094 accumulated
3.12 ±0.15 g/L PHB representing 48.7% of cell dry weight
(CDW), while the control strain Q3095 produced 0.40±0.11 g/L
CDW and trace amount of PHB ( Figure 4C ). All these results
demonstrated that E. coli with overexpression of AdhE mut

acquired the ability to produce value-added bioproducts using
ethanol as carbon source.
Comparison of Glucose, Ethanol and
Acetate as Carbon Source for PHB
Production
Combining the reactions in Figures 1A,B, the overall theoretical
stoichiometry of PHB synthesis from various carbon source
is deduced ( Figure 5A ). It shows that the PHB production
from both glucose and ethanol is coupled with generation of
energy and reducing power, but extra acetate is oxidized to
meet the demand of energy and reducing power in pathway
from acetate to PHB. The theoretical yield of PHB from
ethanol is 0.935 g/g, much higher than its theoretical yields
from the other two feedstocks. So, it is hypothesized that
ethanol could be an ideal carbon source for PHB production in
engineered bacteria.
To verify this hypothesis, comparison of glucose, ethanol and
acetate as carbon source for PHB production was conducted.
The gene acs was cloned into the vector pACYCDuet-1 under
the IPTG-inducible promoter P lac1−6, and co-transformed with
pBAD-Ae-pha into E. coli W3110 to generate strain Q3140.
Then Q3095, Q3094 and Q3140 were grown on glucose, ethanol
and acetate, respectively, and the cell growth, consumption of
carbon source, PHB production, and intracellular metabolites
were monitored during the cultivation process.
After 54 h cultivation, the strain Q3094 presented the highest
cell density, followed by strain Q3095 and Q3140 ( Figure 5B).
At D1 and D2 stages shown in Figure 5B , the consumption
of carbon sources was measured. The strain Q3095 almost
exhausted 10 g/L glucose in 24 h, while 4.81 ±0.17 g/L ethanol

glucose, ethanol, and acetate as carbon source, respectively. For Q3095 and Q3094, 10 g/L glucose and 10 g/L ethanol are supplemented in addition of 1 g/L
glucose, respectively. For Q3140, 1 g/L glucose and 2 g/L acetate were added into the medium at 0 h, and 3 g/L acetate was added at D1 stage. These
experiments were carried out in triplicate, and data represent mean ±SEM.
and 1.29 ±0.01 g/L acetate were consumed by strain Q3094
and Q3140, respectively. At the end of cultivation, the strain
Q3094 consumed 9.68 ±0.02 g/L ethanol, and 4.85 ±0.13 g/L
acetate was catabolized by strain Q3140 ( Figure 5C). The PHB
production of Q3094 is 3.12 ±0.18 g/L, and the yield of PHB
from ethanol is 0.32 ±0.02 g/g ethanol. Both PHB production
and yield were much higher than those from glucose and acetate
(Figure 5D ). These results suggested that ethanol have some
advantages as carbon source for PHB production than glucose
and acetate, such as high cell density, high production and yield.
Differences Between the Metabolism of
Glucose, Ethanol, and Acetate
To ﬁgure out the diﬀerences between the metabolism of glucose,
ethanol and acetate, the targeted metabolome analysis was
performed. Relative amount of acetyl-CoA, by-products, and
main metabolites in central carbon metabolism pathways was
determined at D1 and D2 stages (Figure 5B) by LC-MS/MS, and
shown in Figure 6.
At D1 stage, Q3095 strain grown on glucose produced
the most acetyl-CoA, which was 8.73 times and 6.91 times
higher than strains Q3094 and Q3140, respectively, and the
similar results were observed in supply of energy and reducing
power (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). It is probably
because that glucose is the favorite carbon source of E. coli
(Gorke and Stulke, 2008), and was rapidly metabolized. This
was also conﬁrmed by the highest consumption rate of glucose
(Figure 5C ). At D2 stage, acetyl-CoA and NADH were
undetectable in Q3095 strain as glucose had been depleted.
For metabolites in glycolysis pathway, Q3095 strain also
showed the highest abundance at D1 stage. In particular, the
pyruvate amount in Q3095 strain was more than 20 times
higher than those in the other two strains ( Figure 6 and

mean ±SEM. The acetate production of Q3140 strain cannot be determined as acetate was added as carbon source.
Supplementary Figure S1 ). It was very reasonable because that
glucose was metabolized mainly through glycolysis pathway,
and in Q3094 and Q3140 strains these metabolites have to be
produced from ethanol and acetate through gluconeogenesis as
building blocks for synthesis of components for construction of
cell architecture. At D2 stage, there was not signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between three strains.
In contrast, the relative amount of TCA cycle intermediates
in Q3140 strain was signiﬁcantly higher than those in the other
two strains at both D1 and D2 stages (Supplementary Figure S1).
This phenomenon proved our hypothesis that extra acetate was
oxidized through TCA cycle to produce ATP and NADH.
Remarkably, two by-products, lactate and acetate, were
produced in Q3095 strain in large quantities at D1 stage
(Figure 6), and the accumulation of acidic products could inhibit
further growth of Q3095 strain. The lactate production of Q3095
strain was 229.22 times and 48.59 times as much as those of
Q3094 strain and Q3140 strain, respectively. The accumulation
of lactate was consistent with the high contents of pyruvate and
NADH in Q3095 strain. As is known, glucose is catabolized
through glycolysis pathway to pyruvate, which is converted
into acetyl-CoA under catalysis of pyruvate dehydrogenase, with
reduction of NAD + to NADH in both glycolysis pathway and
pyruvate dehydrogenation. When NADH could not be oxidized
through respiratory chain suﬃciently, the build-up of NADH
rapidly inactivated the pyruvate dehydrogenase (Hansen and
Henning, 1966), leading to accumulation of pyruvate in cells, and
the recycling of NAD +must be achieved through the reduction

Sun et al. Carbon Sources for PHB Production
of some metabolites. Given the circumstances, a large quantity
of lactate was produced by lactate dehydrogenase LdhA via
reduction of pyruvate with consumption of NADH molecule
(Bunch et al., 1997).
Furthermore, Q3095 strain accumulated acetate 10.33-fold
higher than Q3094 strain at D1 stage. In addition to be oxidized
through TCA cycle, acetyl-CoA could be converted into acetate
by PTA and AckA, in coupling with generation of one ATP
molecule (Fox and Roseman, 1986). It was demonstrated that
the majority of the acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate through
the PTA-AckA pathway, and only a minority is metabolized via
TCA cycle to generate NADH and CO 2 when E. coli grows on
glucose aerobically (Clark, 1989). Therefore, acetate accumulated
in medium in large amount. Acetate overﬂow is caused by an
imbalance between the pathways of glycolysis and TCA cycle in
rapidly growing cells, and severely decreases the yield of target
chemicals from glucose (Farmer and Liao, 1997; Wong et al.,
2008). When the glucose supply is depleted, lactate and acetate
can be taken back into the cells and respired. So, the amount
of lactate and acetate dramatically decreased at D2 stage. Based
on the above, the growth of E. coli on glucose was classically
a diauxie, consuming glucose in the ﬁrst half and consuming
lactate and acetate in the second half. It was reported that
E. coli cells grown on glucose produce acetate and consume it
after glucose exhaustion, but do not grow on acetate due to
the decoupling of acetate anabolism and acetate catabolism, and
the growth restores only after prolonged exposure to acetate
(Enjalbert et al., 2015). Here, it is believed that this glucose-
lactate/acetate transition would delay the growth of E. coli, and
further aﬀect the production of target product.
Another thing that deserves special attention was that the
levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in Q3095 and Q3094 strains were
essentially the same, much lower than that in Q3140 strain grown
on acetate at D1 stage ( Figure 6 ). The secondary messenger
cAMP is synthesized from ATP , catalyzed by the adenylyl cyclase
Cya whose activity is controlled by glucose availability (Notley-
McRobb et al., 1997). When the preferred carbon source glucose
is absent, the intracellular cAMP concentration increases ∼10-
fold, converting the cAMP receptor protein CRP into an active
form to activate a number of genes for utilization of carbon
sources other than glucose (Fic et al., 2009). The low cAMP level
in Q3094 strain grown on ethanol indicated that ethanol could be
one of preferred carbon sources of E. coli.
Optimization of Recombinant E. coli
Strain Producing PHB From Ethanol
As the engineered E. coli strain producing PHB from ethanol
presented the highest production and yield, further development
of this strain was carried out. To evaluate the potential inﬂuences
of diﬀerent host strains on PHB production, plasmids pBAD-
Ae-pha and pACYCDuet-adhEmut were transformed into E. coli
BL21(DE3) to generate the strain Q3115, which was compared
with the W3110-based strain Q3094. Grown in minimal medium
containing 1 g/L glucose and 10 g/L ethanol, the strain Q3115
accumulated 2.04 ±0.05 g/L PHB, which was much lower than
that of Q3094 strain (Figure 7A).
The chaperone DnaK was proved to protect the mutant
AdhE against metal-catalyzed oxidation and to improve the
aerobic growth on ethanol of E. coli (Echave et al., 2002).
Furthermore, NADH kinase (POS5) from S. cerevisiaegenerates
NADPH from NADH phosphorylation, helping the cofactor
regeneration during PHB synthesis (Hong et al., 2016). So, the
genes dnaKJ and POS5 were cloned and tested, respectively. As
shown in Figure 7B , POS5 overexpression increased the PHB
production from ethanol to 3.92 ±0.06 g/L, representing 58.5%
of CDW, however, the introduction of dnaKJ impaired the PHB
synthesis severely.
Then, the strain Q3135 was subjected to fed-batch
fermentation to test the feasibility of PHB production from
ethanol in large scale. The fermentations were carried out under
aerobic conditions using minimal medium containing 1 g/L
glucose and 10 g/L ethanol, and ethanol was fed when the carbon
source was depleted. After 115-h fermentation, the strain Q3135
produced 35.67 g/L PHB representing 46.8% of CDW, and
130.5 g/L ethanol was consumed, achieving a yield of 0.273 g/g
ethanol ( Figure 7C ). It was worth noting that the byproduct
formate was accumulated to a concentration of 13.0 g/L, and the

genes involved in formate biosynthesis could be the metabolic
engineering target to improve the PHB yield.
Production of Other Acetyl-CoA
Derivatives From Ethanol
To test whether ethanol is suitable for production of other
acetyl-CoA derived chemicals, the biosynthetic pathways for PG
and 3HP from glucose, ethanol and acetate were constructed
in E. coli, respectively, and comparison of those three carbon
sources was carried out. 3HP and PG are both derived from
the intermediate malonyl-CoA, which is produced from acetyl-
CoA under catalysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC. Then
malonyl-CoA is reduced to 3HP by malonyl-CoA reductase MCR
(Figure 8A), or catalyzed by polyketide synthase PhlD to form PG
(Figure 8B). The theoretical yields of 3HP and PG from various
carbon sources were calculated, and those from ethanol were the
highest (Figures 8A,B).

Sun et al. Carbon Sources for PHB Production
Then, the 3HP- and PG-producingE. colistrains from glucose,
ethanol and acetate were constructed, respectively, and were
inoculated into minimal medium with corresponding carbon
sources. After cultivation in shaking ﬂasks, Q3398 strain grown
on ethanol produced 0.50 ±0.01 g/L 3HP ( Figure 8C ), and
Q3433 strain grown on ethanol produced 0.38 ±0.02 g/L PG
(Figure 8D), much higher than strains grown on the other two
carbon sources. These results demonstrate that ethanol can be
used as carbon source for production of acetyl-CoA derived
chemicals besides PHB.
Ethanol Is a Suitable Carbon Source for
Production of Acetyl-CoA Derivatives
Acetyl-CoA is a fundamental metabolite in bacterial central
metabolic pathways, and also a precursor for biosynthesis of
large number of materials and chemicals (Martin et al., 2003;
Meng et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016). A series of acetyl-CoA
derived chemical and material have been successfully produced
by engineered E. colistrains, such as PG (Cao et al., 2011), 3HP
(Liu et al., 2016, 2019), fatty acids (Cao et al., 2010), polyketides
(Yuzawa et al., 2012), terpenoids (Martin et al., 2003), and PHAs
(Meng et al., 2012).
Conversion of glucose into acetyl-CoA presents low atomic
economy due to the release of CO 2, leading to decrease of
theoretical production yield, titer and productivity of target
product (Chae et al., 2017). To improve the atomic economy
of biosynthesis process, fatty acids were tested as an alternative
carbon source (Liu et al., 2019). Catabolized through β-oxidation
pathways, fatty acids are transformed into acetyl-CoA with 100%
carbon recovery in addition to production of reducing power.
Although the production and yield of target chemical were
increased signiﬁcantly (Liu et al., 2019), the water-insoluble
nature of fatty acids makes it diﬃcult to handle and monitor
the fermentation process. Several synthetic pathways for acetyl-
CoA from one-carbon substrates have been constructed in
E. coli (Lu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019), but their eﬃciency
remains far below what is required for eﬀective production of
chemicals and materials.
In this study, E. coli strain growing on ethanol was
constructed, and the bioconversion of ethanol into a series
of bioproducts including PHB, 3HP and PG was achieved in
recombinant E. coli strains. Furthermore, metabolome analysis
was carried out to discover the diﬀerences between metabolism of
glucose, ethanol and acetate in engineeredE. colistrains. All these
results suggested that ethanol may be a suitable carbon source for
production of acetyl-CoA derived bioproducts.
Firstly, ethanol is an ordinary and inexpensive commodity
chemical. Besides fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass (Sun
and Cheng, 2002), ethanol can also be produced from coal by
chemical methods. The capacity of ethanol production from
coal has exceeded 2 million tons per year in China. Secondly,
the conversion of ethanol into acetyl-CoA presents high atomic
economy, in addition to the generation of NADH. However,
CO2 is released in glucose catabolism and ATP is consumed
to synthesis acetyl-CoA from acetate ( Figure 1 ). Therefore,
the theoretical yield of target chemical from ethanol is much
higher than those from glucose and acetate ( Figures 5A, 7A,B).
Furthermore, ethanol has a higher energy density. If oxidized
completely to CO 2 and H 2O in bacteria, 0.326 mol of ATP is
generated from 1 g ethanol, while 0.178 and 0.133 mol of ATP
can be produced from 1 g glucose and acetate, respectively.
Moreover, E. coliis easy to reach a balance between growth and
production when grown on ethanol. As glucose is the favorite
carbon source of E. coli, it was rapidly metabolized in the ﬁrst
half of cultivation ( Figure 5C ) to produce a large amount of
lactate and acetate ( Figure 6 ), leading to a bi-phasic growth
which may delay the further bacterial growth and lower the
production of target chemical. The assimilation of ethanol was
neither as fast as glucose to accumulate by-products, nor as slow
as acetate to retard the bacterial growth, helping bacteria reach a
balance between growth and production. Additionally, the nature
of ethanol, such as low toxicity and high water-solubility, makes
it friendly to the bacterial cultivation process.
Although our study showed the feasibility of ethanol to
support E. coli growth and bioproduction, there are still some
problems remaining. The ethanol utilizing gene adhEmut was
carried by a plasmid vector, leading to addition of antibiotic
into medium and increasing of production cost. Besides that, the
strain performance may be aﬀected by the strain instability due
to plasmid loss. This problem can be dissolved by the integration
of adhEmut gene into bacterial chromosome. Furthermore, the
PHB yield was 0.32 ±0.02 g/g ethanol in our engineered strain,
representing only 34% of the theoretical limit ( Figure 4 ), and
the productions of 3HP and PG from ethanol were both much
lower than previous reports from other carbon sources probably
due to the lack of overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(Cao et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019). It is necessary to carry
out further development to achieve a higher production and
yield from ethanol.
Conclusion
In summary, the bifunctional dehydrogenase AdhE
A267T/E568K mutant, which converts ethanol into acetyl-
CoA, was introduced into E. coli strain, conferring E. coli the
growth capability on ethanol. Several products derived from
acetyl-CoA, such as PHB, 3HP and PG, were produced from
ethanol by recombinant E. coli strains. Compared with glucose
and acetate, the strains grown on ethanol presented the highest
production and yield, and metabolome analysis revealed the
reasons of high yield from ethanol. All these results demonstrate
that ethanol is a putative carbon source for production of
acetyl-CoA derived bioproducts.
