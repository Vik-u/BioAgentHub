Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus is an anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium. Its unique CO 2
ﬁxation pathway and primitive light-harvesting antenna complexes have attracted
extensive research attentions. In this work, we investigated the photoheterotrophic
growth of C. aurantiacus J-10-ﬂ using acetate [at 55◦C and without H2(g)]. The results
indicate that glycine can promote anaerobic biomass production in a minimal medium
by threefold to ﬁvefold. Via 13C-metabolite analysis, we observed that glycine was
involved in serine synthesis. Instead of being used as a major carbon source, glycine
was degraded to produce C1 units and NAD(P)H. Tracer experiments also suggest
that photoheterotrophic cultures growing with a exogenous glycine source exhibited
capabilities of assimilating CO
2 via multiple routes (including the 3-hydroxypropionate
pathway). Finally, glycylglycine, a commonly used culture buffer, also signiﬁcantly
enhanced photoheterotrophic growth ofC. aurantiacus, probably due to its thermal or
enzymatic breakdown to glycine.

INTRODUCTION
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus is a ﬁlamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium isolated from hot
springs (Hanada and Pierson, 2006). It has specialized light-harvesting antenna machines and
performs a cyclic photosynthetic electron transport via a type II reaction center (Tang and
Blankenship, 2013). Its photosystem does not generate NADPH directly, but can convert light
energy into ATP via photosynthetic electron transfer. The genome ofC. aurantiacusstrain J-10-ﬂ

et al., 2011). C. aurantiacusshows a versatile carbon metabolism. In aerobic and dark conditions,
it can grow on various organic substrates chemoheterotrophically.C. aurantiacus switches to
photoheterotrophic growth when supplied with acetate under anaerobic and light conditions. In

the3-hydroxypropionate (3HOP)bi-cycle pathway (Eisenreich etal.,1993;Zarzycki etal.,2009).
In its natural habitat,C. aurantiacusconsumes organic nutrients(e.g., short-chain fatty acids,
acetate, etc.) released from cyanobacteria in the associated microbial mats (Hanada and Pierson,
2006; Lee et al., 2014). Its phototrophic metabolisms for coassimilation of organic substrates have
been extensively studied. For photoheterotrophic culture ofC. aurantiacus, the common growth

photoheterotrophic cultures, both acetate and mixed gases of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All chemicals and labeled substrates (13C-sodium acetate and
NaH13CO3, purity> 98%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).C. aurantiacus strain J-10-ﬂ was grown
in a minimal PE medium at 55◦C. One liter medium contained
5 mL phosphate buﬀer solution, 5 mL basal salt solution,
0.5 g Na2S2O3 and 0.5 g (NH4)2SO4. One liter of phosphate
solution contained 75 g KH 2PO4 and 78 g K2HPO4.O n e
liter of basal salt solution contained 4.12 g Na3EDTA, 1.11 g
FeSO4·7H2O, 24.65 g MaSO4·7H2O, 2.94 g CaCl2·2H2O, 23.4 g
NaCl and 10 mL tracer solution. One liter of tracer solution
contained 11.2 g MnSO4·4H2O, 2.88 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 2.92 g
Co(NO3)2·4H2O, 2.52 g CuSO4·5H2O, 2.42 g Na2MoO4·2H2O,
3.1gH 3BO3 and41.2gNa 3EDTA.ThemediumpHwasadjusted
to 7.5. Commercial RPMI 1640 vitamins solution (100X, Sigma–
Aldrich) was added into the sterile medium. In nutrient studies,
yeast extract or amino acids were added into medium to test
their eﬀects on cell growth. For photoheterotrophic cultivation,
the anaerobic cultures (purged with N2) were grown in sealed
serum bottles (containing 30 mL culture) under continuous
illumination (20–30μmol photons m−2 s−1). Neither H2(g) nor
CO2(g) wasprovidedinthebottleheadspace.Biomassgrowthwas
monitored basedonoptical densitiesat600nm.
Strain J-10-ﬂ was cultivated in four tracer media: (a) 2 g/L
[1-13C]acetate and 0.2 g/L unlabeled yeast extract; (b) 2 g/L
[1,2-13C2]acetate (fully labeled acetate) and 0.05 g/L unlabeled
glycine; (c) 2 g/L [1,2- 13C2]acetate, 0.05 g/L glycine, and
0.5 g/L NaH13CO3; and (d) 2 g/L unlabeled acetate, 0.05 g/L
unlabeled glycine, and 0.5 g/L NaH 13CO3.I ne a c ht r a c e r

were inoculated in the labeled medium at a volume ratio of 1%.

(Tang et al., 2007; You et al., 2012). In brief, the biomass was
hydrolyzed in HCl solution (100◦C), and the resulting amino
acid mixtures were derivatized by N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-
N-methyltriﬂuoroacetamide (TBDMS). GC-MS equipped with
a DB5-MS column (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to
measure amino acid labeling pattern. The mass isotopomer
distributions (MIDs) of amino acids were calculated based on
ﬁve MS fragments (Wahl et al., 2004): [M-159]+ or [M-85]+
(both containing the carbon skeleton of amino acids after loss of
theirα carboxyl groups), [M-15]+ or [M-57]+ (both containing
the whole carbon skeleton of amino acids), and f302 (containing
the ﬁrst and the second carbon of amino acids). The ﬁnal MS
results, M0, M1, and M2, represent unlabeled, singly labeled,
and doubly labeled amino acids, respectively (Figure 1 ). We
also measured glycine concentrations in the cultures by GC-
MS. In brief, culture samples were centrifuged and supernatant
was collected. After the supernatant was dried, glycine from
the supernatant was derivatized by TBDMS. Meanwhile, we
determined the relationship between the glycine standards and
corresponding MS abundances, which were used to estimate
extracellularglycine concentrations incultures.
RESULTS
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus exhibits optimal growth in
photoheterotrophic conditions when the medium is
supplemented with yeast extract. It can also grow well with
acetateandH
2 inaminimalmedium( Straussetal.,1992 ).Inour
experiments, strain J-10-ﬂ supplied with yeast extract reached
an OD above 1.0 within 6 days during photoheterotrophic
growth. Without H2 and yeast extract in the minimal medium,
however, photoheterotrophic cultures grew poorly. To identify
the biomass building blocks that were not eﬀectively synthesized
from primary substrate acetate, photoheterotrophic cultures
were supplied with 13C-labeled sodium acetate and unlabeled
yeast extract. Figure 1 shows the contribution of yeast extract
to the synthesis of proteinogenic amino acids. Based on
tracer experiments, a high fraction of 13C-carbon (40–70%)
was incorporated into several amino acids, such as Ala, Glu,
Met, and Asp, suggesting eﬀective synthesis of those amino
acids from acetate. Since the labeled carbon of [1-13C]acetate
(purity > 98%) would be mostly incorporated into amino acids
via central metabolic pathways, high unlabeled fractions of
amino acids (e.g., Gly, Leu, and Phe) indicated that they were
avidlyabsorbed from exogenoussources.
We then investigated the inﬂuences of these highly imported
amino acids on the photoheterotrophic growth by replacing
yeast extract with diﬀerent amino acids. We observed the most
signiﬁcant growth enhancement (threefold to ﬁvefold) when
glycine was supplied (Figure 2 ), and a glycine concentration
between 0.05 g/L and 0.25 g/L seems to suﬃce for enhancing
the bacterial growth (Supplementary Figure S1). The inﬂuence
of inorganic carbon was also investigated, which conﬁrmed that
addition of NaHCO3 (0.5 g/L) in medium slightly promoted
photoheterotrophic growth, but much less than glycine did.
Therefore, inorganic carbon source was not the rate limiting
nutrients to the strain J-10-ﬂ, and glycine played an important
role in supporting the bacterial growth. These observations
thus intrigued us to further investigate the role of glycine in
C. aurantiacusmetabolism.
To this end, we ﬁrst traced the fate of glycine in the central
carbon metabolism via13C labeling experiments. We cultivated
strain J-10-ﬂ photoheterotrophically with [1,2- 13C2]acetate
and unlabeled glycine, and then measured the isotopomer
distributions of proteinogenic amino acids. Figure 3 shows
that 13C from labeled acetate was incorporated into many key
proteinogenic amino acids (e.g., Ala, Asp, and Glu)at signiﬁcant

levels (>90%), suggesting that glycine was not used as a carbon
source for biomass synthesis. The only signiﬁcant contributions
of glycine to proteinogenic amino acids were glycine at 70%
and serine (converted via glycine hydroxymethyltransferase,
Caur_2543) at 30% (Supplementary Table S1). Substituting
glycine with serine in minimal medium led to only a slight
increaseincellgrowth(SupplementaryFigureS1).Therefore,the
profound growth enhancement by addition of glycine appears to
be predominately due to factors other than direct conversion to
biomass.
Glycine metabolism of C. aurantiacus has been previously
investigated during photoautotrophic growth ( Herter et al.,
2001). The researchers have shown that: (1)C. aurantiacusdoes
not generate glycine from glyoxylate (a product of the 3HOP
pathway), and (2) it exhibits high enzyme activity to produce C1
unitsfrom glycinecleavage.C1units, including 5,10-methylene-
tetrahydrofolate (5, 10-methyl ene-THF), 5-methyl-THF and

10-formyl-THF, participate in biosynthesis of amino acids and

derived from glycine degradation, can be converted to 5-

synthesis and the latter His synthesis. As for cultures growing
with[1,2-
13C2]acetateandunlabeledglycine,themostabundant
isotopologs of the resulting proteinogenic Met and His have
a single unlabeled carbon (Figure 3 ), which suggested that
C1 units are mainly synthesized from glycine cleavage under
photoheterotrophic conditions. Following is the glycine cleavage
reaction (Kikuchi etal.,2008):
Glycine + THF + NAD+ ↔ 5, 10-methylene-THF
+ CO2 + NH3 + NADH + H+
Glycine cleavage can also be coupled with the serine
hydroxymethyltransferase reaction:

2Glycine + NAD+ + H2O ↔ Serine + CO2 + NH3
+ NADH + H+
In fact, the glycine consumption rate was higher than
its requirement as a carbon source for biomass growth
(Supplementary Figure S2). Therefore, part of glycine must
be cleaved and oxidized by the THF-dependent C1 pathway,
which contains successive steps that oxidize 5, 10-methylene-
T H Ft of o r m a t eo rC O2, generating both NADPH and ATP
(Fan et al., 2014). The fate of glycine/C1-metabolism and the
distribution ofC1-metabolicenzymes/geneshavebeendiscussed
for bacteria and archaea, includingChloroﬂexi (Braakman and
Smith, 2012). These studies suggest that glycine cleavage and
C1 degradation can serve as a key energetic route to produce
ATP, NADH, and NADPH. Therefore, it is likely that glycine
is actively involved in the energy metabolism ofC. aurantiacus
underphotoheterotrophic conditions.
In addition to glycine metabolism, we were also interested in
investigating the CO2 ﬁxation activity under photoheterotrophic
conditions in the absence of H2, as C. aurantiacus possesses
multiple carbon ﬁxation routes (Tang et al., 2011). To this end,
we added NaH13CO3 (0.5 g/L) to minimal medium containing
unlabeled acetate and glycine (Figures 4A–D). A protein BLAST
search against either Escherichia coli or Synechocystis 6803
carbonic anhydrase on NCBI website suggests that the gene
encoding carbonic anhydrase that converts H13CO3− to 13CO2
is missing inC. aurantiacus, and an alternative13CO2 source
would be from the HCO3−-CO2 equilibrium in the culture
medium (pH = 7.5). Although addition of NaHCO3 did not
appear to promote strain J-10-ﬂ growth (Figure 2 ), enzyme
activities of CO2 ﬁxation was measurable due to signiﬁcant13C
incorporationintoproteinogenicaminoacids(e.g., ∼40%alanine
is singly labeled and 5% alanine is doubly labeled,Figure 4A
and Supplementary Table S1). As pyruvate is involved in the
CO2 ﬁxation pathways and also a precursor to alanine, the
labeling patterns of alanine can reﬂect CO 2 ﬁxation routes
(Figure 5 ). MS data show that alanine was mostly labeled at
ﬁrst position, and a small fraction of alanine was labeled at both
ﬁrst and second positions (Supplementary Table S1).Figure 5B
shows the origins of diﬀerent labeling patterns of alanine.
Firstly, unlabeledacetyl-CoAandH 13CO3− canbecondensedto
[1-13C]pyruvate by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR,
Caur_2080) or the 3HOP pathway. After a second H13CO3−
is incorporated in the 3HOP pathway, doubly labeled malyl-
CoA is formed, subsequently resulting in the formation of
[1-13C]acetyl-CoA via a cleavage reaction. When the PFOR
reaction or the 3HOP pathway converts [1-13C] acetyl-CoA
into pyruvate, [1,2-13C2] pyruvate is generated, which explains
the origin of [1,2-13C2] alanine. Under anaerobic conditions
without H2, the ﬂux of the 3HOP pathway for CO2 ﬁxation
is weak, and [1,2-13C2] alanine only accounts for ∼5% of
the total alanine (Supplementary Table S1), probably due to
the lack of reducing equivalents to power this pathway. As a
consequence,most[1- 13C]pyruvatewouldbegeneratedfromthe
PFOR reaction, which also leads to production of [1-13C] serine
and [1-13C] glycine (Figures 4B,C ) after pyruvate is converted
into downstream metabolites.Figure 4D shows similar labeling
patterns between Met (derived from oxaloacetate and C1 unit)
and Asp (derived from oxaloacetate), further conﬁrming that
most C1 units come from glycine degradation (Figure 5A ). This
phenomenon also indicates that13CO2 is not preferred to be
ﬁxed via the reductive C1 pathway (CO2 ↔ formyl-THF ↔ 5,
10-methylene-THF) under photoheterotrophic conditions, as 5,
10-methylene-THF can be continuously generated from glycine.
Weconclude that reducingequivalentsfrom glycine degradation
are insuﬃcient to drive appreciable CO2 ﬁxation as part of
promoting heterotrophic growth.
Figure 4E shows that13C enrichment shifts of various amino
acidsafterNaH 13CO3 additionintominimalmediumcontaining
[1,2-13C2]acetate and unlabeled glycine. When strain J-10-ﬂ was
grown without NaH13CO3, 70% proteinogenic glycine and 40%
proteinogenic serine were unlabeled. Other key proteinogenic
amino acids (i.e., Ala, Asp and Glu) were labeled signiﬁcantly
(
13Ce n r i c h m e n t s∼90%). The small fraction of 12Ci nt h e s e
amino acids was possibly from the metabolic assimilation of
12CO2 releasedfromglycinedegradation.WhenstrainJ-10-ﬂwas
cultivated with NaH13CO3, unlabeled glycine and fully labeled
acetate, 13C enrichments in all proteinogenic amino acids were
furtherraised(e.g., ∼95%ofGlucarbonswere 13C-carbons).This
observation conﬁrms photoheterotrophic CO2 co-utilizations by
strainJ-10-ﬂ.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we attempted to understand why glycine can
promote C. aurantiacus growth on acetate. Herter et al.
(2001) have previously reported the contribution of glycine to
photoautotrophic growth ofC. aurantiacusstrain OK-70-ﬂ with
H
2/CO2. The study indicated that glycine could participate in
serine synthesis and contribute approximately half of the C1
units to biomass synthesis. As a comparison, we tested the
growth eﬀect of glycine on strain OK-70-ﬂ strain and revealed
a similar growth enhancement (by threefold to fourfold) on
strain J-10-ﬂ during photoheterotrophic growth (Supplementary
Figure S3 and related contents). Whether glycine can promote
photoheterotrophic growth in the presence of H
2 remains to be
tested.
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus does not contain a type I reaction
center, and its cyclic photosynthetic electron transport system
within the type-II reaction center generates ATP. We searched
the genome database of strain J-10-ﬂ and found the gene
encoding a nickel-dependent hydrogenase (Caur_1188), which
may generate NADPH in the presence of H2.H o w e v e r ,w h e n

generation could be less eﬃcient. The major routes in central
carbon metabolism for producing reducing power are the
TCA cycle and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP).
However, acetate-based metabolism usually does not show
strong ﬂuxes through the OPPP, and both PFOR reaction and
gluconeogenesis consume reducing equivalents. Additionally,
genes encoding transhydrogenase have not yet been reported to
exist in the genome ofC. aurantiacus. Therefore, NADH and

NADPH production from glycine cleavage and C1 degradation
may increase energy ﬂexibility and thus promoteC. aurantiacus
anaerobic growth. On the other hand, the THF-dependent C1
degradation pathway inC. aurantiacusappears to be inﬂuenced
by H2. In our study, glycine cleavage contributes to C1 units
for both Met and His synthesis under photoheterotrophic
conditions.Incomparisons, Herteretal.(2001) haveinvestigated
C. aurantiacusphototrophicgrowthwithfullylabeledglycineand
H2/unlabeled CO2. Their labeling data ofMet and His revealed
that5,10-methylene-THF(theC1unitforMetsynthesis)derived
from fully labeled glycine was not converted to formyl-THF
(the C1 unit for His synthesis). This phenomenon implied that
H2 may inhibit the C1 unit oxidation, and that formyl-THF
synthesis could be formed reductively from CO2 in the presence
of H2. Lastly, it is possible that glycine may be also involved
in other unknown mechanisms promoting C. aurantiacus
photoheterotrophic growth. For example, a previous report has
discovered the marine bacteriumPelagibacter ubique possesses
all the genes for amino acid biosynthesis, but is still eﬀectively
auxotrophic for glycine (Trippetal.,2009 ).
Aninteresting fact is thatglycylglycine, adipeptide of glycine,
has been employed in the earliest studies of C. aurantiacus
(Madigan et al., 1974 ), which gave the best growth of C.
aurantiacus compared to other buﬀers (e.g., Tris, phosphate,
and MOPS). Notably, glycylglycine is known to be a good
buﬀer for biological systems since it is relatively non-toxic
(Smith and Smith, 1949). In the absence of H2, C. aurantiacus
grew much better in glycylglycine than in MOPS or other
buﬀers (Supplementary Figure S3). Glycylglycine could be
hydrolyzed at high temperature during medium autoclave and
cell incubations (Radzicka and Wolfenden, 1996), or degraded
by a membrane dipeptidase (Caur_2632). Our isotopic analysis

of proteinogenic glutamate was completely unlabeled). Since the
culture was grown in minimal medium containing13C-acetate
as the sole carbon source, the unlabeled glycine in the biomass
must come from unlabeled glycylglycine. All these evidences
imply that glycylglycine could be considered as an exogenous
source of glycine contributing to growth enhancement for
C. aurantiacus.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we traced glycine in the central carbon metabolism
to answer how it can enhance photoheterotrophic growth of
C. aurantiacus in the absence of H 2. Our results, together
with previous studies and genome annotations, indicate that
glycine can be used for producing biomass (mainly glycine and
