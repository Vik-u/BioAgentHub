Some scholars caution that long-term ad libitum feeding with probiotic fermented food poses potential 
health risks to baby animals. We conducted a feeding experiment to investigate the influence of ad 
libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet on the gut 
microbiome, gut metabolomic profiles, bile acid metabolism, proinflammatory cytokines and faecal 
consistency. Compared with piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet, piglets fed the 
Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet had lower intestinal bacterial diversity (P > 0.05), higher intestinal 
fungal diversity (P > 0.05), more Firmicutes (P > 0.05), fewer Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and 
Proteobacteria (P > 0.05), higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (P < 0.05), orotic acid 
(P < 0.05), interleukin-6 (P < 0.01), lactic acid (P < 0.01), deoxycholic acid (P > 0.05) and lithocholic 
acid (P < 0.01) and a higher incidence of diarrhoea (P > 0.05). The data show that ad libitum feeding of 
piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet during the suckling and early post-weaning periods 
promotes the growth of lactic acid bacteria, bile salt hydrolase-active bacteria and 7a-dehydroxylase-
active bacteria in the intestinal lumen; disturbs the normal production of lactic acid, orotic acid and 
unconjugated bile acids; and increases circulating interleukin-6 levels and diarrhoea incidence.
Probiotics have been proven to be useful in rebalancing the intestinal flora, improving inflammation and diges-
tion and preventing cardiovascular diseases
1–4, and as a result probiotics are now widely used in food processing 
and disease control and prevention. To improve the health and growth of children and young animals, specific 
probiotics are often added to their food at varying doses. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the 
effects of the routine intake and excessive intake of probiotics on intestinal flora composition, digestion and intes-
tinal health in calves, lambs, piglets and human infants. The resulting data have shown that feeding a moderate 
dose of probiotics to calves and lambs improves their health and performance
5–9. Kukkonen et al. reported thatthe 
daily feeding of probiotics to newborn human infants for 6 months using an 8–9 ×  109 colony-forming-unit mix-
ture of specific probiotics was safe10. However, others have argued that supplementing the daily food of infants 
with probiotics should be done with caution or not at all 11–13 because of the underdeveloped state of the infant 
immune system14. Li et al. (2012) found that oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus at a high dose to pig-
lets resulted in severe diarrhoea15. Thus, there is still controversy regarding the safety and impact of probiotics on 
young animals, particularly regarding the strains, dosage and duration of probiotic administration. These factors 
should be taken into account as different strains, dosages and durations may have drastically different effects than 
intended
16. More information is needed regarding the long-term safety of probiotics and probiotic fermented 
food11,13, especially regarding lactic acidosis and bile salt malabsorption caused by bacterial overgrowth; these 
issues have been rarely studied11.
The intestinal flora of pigs plays important roles in intestinal morphology, immunity, digestion and health17–19. 
Generally, from a phylum-level perspective, the flora of the pig intestine can be classified into five phyla:

Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes. Firmicutes represents the largest 
proportion of the total population, followed by Bacteroidetes. These two phyla account for approximately 90% of 
all the bacteria present in the pig intestine. However, the intestinal microbiota is dynamic, and its composition 
changes continually in response to time, age, diet, probiotics and many other factors
20.
In the present study, suckling piglets were used as a model to study the influence of long-term ad libitum 
feeding of a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet on intestinal flora composition, pH, unconjugated bile acids, 
inflammation and diarrhoea in order to inform risk assessments and investigate the safety of using Bacillus subtilis 
fermented products as a daily food for baby monogastric animals.
Results
Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) and Alpha Diversity. The sequence data produced in this experi-
ment have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive 
(SRA) under accession number SRP060218. Data on OTU and alpha diversity of the microorganism communi-
ties in different dietary treatment groups are listed in Table 1 The OTU number, Chao 1 and Shannon values of 
bacterial communities in the jejunal luminal content of weaned piglets from the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid 
diet (BFLD) group were lower (P  >  0.05) than those of weaned piglets from the Bacillus subtilis -supplemented 
commercial pellet diet (BCPD) group. In contrast, the OTU numbers and Chao 1 values of bacterial communi-
ties in the colonic luminal content of weaned piglets from the BFLD group were higher (P >  0.05) than those of 
weaned piglets from the BCPD group, which did not hold true for the Shannon value. These results indicated 
that the feeding of Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet to piglets decreased bacterial richness and diversity in 
the jejunal luminal content and decreased bacterial diversity in the colonic luminal content. The Chao 1 values 
of the fungal community were lower (P >  0.05) in the jejunal luminal content but were higher (P >  0.05) in the 
colonic luminal content of weaned piglets from the BFLD group than those of weaned piglets from the BCPD 
group. These findings suggest that feeding with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet increases fungal diversity 
in the jejunal and colonic luminal contents of weaned piglets compared with feeding with a Bacillus subtilis-sup-
plemented pellet diet.
Compositions and Relative Abundances of Microorganisms in Jejunal and Colonic Luminal 
Contents. The compositions and relative abundances of microorganisms in the jejunal and colonic lumi-
nal contents are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Firmicutes and Ascomycota were the dominant phyla in 
the jejunal and colonic luminal contents of weaned piglets fed either the Bacillus subtilis  fermented liquid diet 
or the Bacillus subtilis -supplemented commercial pellet diet. Compared with weaned piglets from the BCPD 
group, weaned piglets from the BFLD group had a higher (P  >  0.05) relative abundance of Firmicutes in the 
jejunal and colonic luminal contents, a lower (P >  0.05) relative abundance of Ascomycota in the jejunal luminal 
content and a higher (P >  0.05) relative abundance of Ascomycota in the colonic luminal content. The relative 
abundances of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were lower (P >  0.05) in the jejunal and colonic 
luminal contents of weaned piglets from the BFLD group compared with those from the BCPD group. At the 
genus level, Lactobacillus and Kazachstania were the dominant genera in jejunal and colonic luminal contents 
of weaned piglets from both the BFLD and BCPD groups. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the jejunal 
and colonic luminal contents of weaned piglets from the BFLD group was higher (P >  0.05) than that of weaned 
piglets from the BCPD group. Weaned piglets from the BFLD group had a lower (P  >  0.05) relative abundance 
of Kazachstania in the jejunal luminal content and a higher ( P >  0.05) relative abundance of Kazachstania  in 
the colonic luminal content compared with weaned piglets from the BCPD group. The relative abundances of 
Streptococcus, Clostridium_sensu_stricto, Bacteroides and Flavobacterium in the jejunal luminal content of weaned 
piglets from the BFLD group were significantly lower (P <  0.01 or P <  0.05) than those of weaned piglets from the 
BFLD group BCPD group p-value

BCPD group. The relative abundances of Pseudobutyrivibrio, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Erysipelotrichaceae_
unclassified, Ruminococcus, Clostridiales_unclassified and Lachnospiraceae_uncultured in the colons of weaned 
piglets from the BFLD group were significantly higher (P <  0.01 or P <  0.05) than those of weaned piglets from 
the BCPD group.
Differential Metabolite Levels in Jejunal and Colonic Luminal Contents. All metabolites found 
at levels that differed between the two piglet groups are listed in Tables 4 and 5. Thirteen differentially observed 
metabolites in the jejunal luminal content and eleven differentially observed metabolites in the colonic luminal 
content were identified. Piglets from the BFLD group had higher (P <  0.05) relative levels of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid and orotic acid in their jejunal luminal content and higher (P <  0.05) relative levels of stigmasterol in their 
colonic luminal content than piglets from the BCPD group. Except for 3-hydroxypropionic acid, orotic acid and 
stigmasterol, the relative levels of other differentially observed metabolites in the jejunal and colonic luminal con-
tents of weaned piglets from the BFLD group were significantly lower (P <  0.01 or P <  0.05) than those of piglets 
from the BCPD group.
Serum Cytokines, Intestinal pH and Unconjugated Bile Acids. Piglets from the BFLD group had sig-
nificantly higher serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (P <  0.01) than piglets from the BCPD group (Table 6). There 
were no significant differences (P >  0.05) in the levels of serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α ) and IL-1β  
between the BFLD and BCPD groups.
There was no significant difference in the pH values of the jejunal luminal content between the BFLD and 
BCPD groups (P  >  0.05). However, the pH values of the colonic luminal content collected from piglets in the 
BFLD group were significantly lower than the pH values of the colonic luminal content collected from piglets in 
the BCPD group (P <  0.05).
The jejunal luminal content collected from the BFLD group had significantly higher lactic acid and lithocholic 
acid (LCA) concentrations (P  <  0.01) and significantly lower cholic acid (CA) concentrations (P  <  0.05) than 
that collected from the BFLD group. There were no significant differences in chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)

concentrations of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid in the colonic luminal content collected from the BFLD group 
were not significantly higher than those in the colonic content collected from the BCPD group (P >  0.05).
Diarrhoea Incidence. The data in Table 7 show that piglets from the BFLD group had a higher incidence of 
diarrhoea than piglets from the BCPD group at each experimental time point, but there was no significant differ-
ence (P >  0.05) in the incidence of diarrhoea between the BFLD and BCPD groups.
Discussion
Previous studies have reported that the diversity, composition and relative abundance of intestinal flora can be 
influenced by probiotic administration or dietary patterns
21,22. The feeding of probiotics and a probiotic fer -
mented diet to animals decreases microbial diversity, and the reduced microbial diversity is often associated with 
gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease
23. In the present study, 25-day feeding with a 
Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet to piglets aged 7 to 31 days decreased the bacterial diversity but increased 
the fungal diversity of jejunal and colonic luminal contents compared with 25-day feeding with a Bacillus 
subtilis-supplemented pellet diet; the decreased bacterial diversity of piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid 
diet resulted in a higher diarrhoea incidence than observed in the piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pel-
let diet. In addition, Ley et al. reported that the gut microbiome is dominated by four bacterial phyla: Firmicutes, 
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria
24; data in this study also indicated that the flora in the jeju -
nal and colonic luminal contents of piglets fed continuously with a Bacillus subtilis  fermented liquid diet or a 
Bacillus subtilis- supplemented pellet diet were also dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, 
Proteobacteria and Ascomycota. However, different dietary patterns influenced the relative abundances of 
intestinal flora: piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis  fermented liquid diet had higher (P  >  0.05) relative abundances 
of organisms from the Firmicutes phylum and Lactobacillus  genus in their jejunal luminal contents than pig-
lets fed a Bacillus subtilis -supplemented pellet diet. Regarding the relative abundances of flora in the colonic

luminal contents, piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet not only had higher (P >  0.05) relative abun-
dances of organisms of the Firmicutes phylum and Lactobacillus  genus but also had higher (P  >  0.05) relative 
abundances of organisms of the Ascomycota phylum and Kazachstania  genus than did piglets fed a Bacillus 
subtilis-supplemented pellet diet. These results indicate that a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet has an advantage in 
promoting the growth of the flora noted above because the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet has ingredients 
more suitable for the growth of intestinal flora than the Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet.
Orotic acid is often regarded as one of the major oxidative stressors at high concentrations25. Additionally, cir-
culating levels of IL-6 and the growth of Coprococcus, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Dorea increase under the action of 
stressors26. Piglets from the BFLD group had significantly higher orotic acid levels in their jejunal luminal content 
than piglets from the BCPD group. As a result, piglets from the BFLD group had higher circulating IL-6 levels 
and higher relative abundances of Coprococcus, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Dorea than piglets from the BCPD group.
Elevated levels of circulating IL-6 are often associated with a number of diseases 27. People with high IL-6 
levels have a high risk of systemic mastocytosis28, and elevated circulating IL-6 has been proposed as a marker of 
inflammation linking obesity with insulin resistance and diabetes as well as atherosclerosis29,30. High serum levels 
of IL-6 may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis in young people, which is characterized by intense joint 
pain, stiffness, weakness, marasmus and apocleisis
31.
Studies have demonstrated that diarrhoea can be prevented by the administration of probiotics or probiotic 
fermented food32. However, Li et al. (2012) found that oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus at a high 
dose to piglets caused diarrhoea15. Data in the present study also showed that piglets from the BFLD group had a 
higher incidence of diarrhoea than piglets from the BCPD group.
Conjugated bile acids have emulsifying and surfactant properties; they are more efficient than unconjugated 
bile acids in aiding in the emulsification of dietary lipids and preventing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth33,34. 
In normal conditions, the composition of bile acids in the intestine is often in a relative balance; only small 
amounts of conjugated bile acids are hydrolyzed into primary bile acids (CA and CDCA), and small amounts 
of primary bile acids are dehydroxylated into secondary bile acids (DCA and LCA) in the small intestine
35. 
Approximately 95% of bile acids (conjugated and unconjugated) are reabsorbed by the distal ileum. The small 
percentage of bile acids remaining reaches the colon, where they are deconjugated and dehydroxylated by bacte-
ria to produce the secondary bile acids (DCA and LCA)
36. However, overgrowth of bile salt hydrolase-active and 
7a-dehydroxylase-active bacteria in the intestine will alter the normal bile acid composition and damage normal 
enterohepatic circulation.

Some strains of Lactobacillus37, Erysipelotrichaceae38, Lachnospiraceae39, Clostridium40,41 and Bacteroides42,43 
are bile salt hydrolase-active intestinal bacteria, and some strains of Lactobacillus 44, Lachnospiraceae 45,46, 
Ruminococcaceae 45, Clostridiaceae 46,47, Eubacterium48 and Peptostreptococcus 49 are 7a-dehydroxylase-active 
intestinal bacteria. In the present study, compared with piglets from the BCPD group, piglets from the BFLD 
group had lower (P <  0.01) relative abundances of Clostridium and Bacteroides in their jejunal luminal content. 
This condition resulted in piglets from the BFLD group having lower CA and CDCA levels in their jejunal luminal 
content. Lactobacilli are also 7a-dehydroxylase-active bacteria, and the relative abundance of Lactobacilli in the 
jejunal luminal content of piglets from the BFLD group were higher than those in piglets from the BCPD group. 
This is the reason why piglets from the BFLD group had higher DCA and LCA levels in their jejunal luminal 
content than piglets from the BCPD group did. Piglets from the BFLD group also had higher relative abundances 
of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcus and Clostridiales in 
their colonic luminal contents than piglets from the BCPD group. Therefore, in the BFLD piglets, more conju-
gated bile acids were hydrolyzed into CA and CDCA, while CA and CDCA were dehydroxylated into DCA and 
LCA, respectively. As a result, piglets from the BFLD group had higher CA, CDCA, DCA and LCA levels in their 
colonic luminal content than piglets from the BCPD group.
Unconjugated bile acids are less water soluble than conjugated bile acids. Intense elevation of the concen-
tration of unconjugated bile acids has detrimental effects on the intestinal mucosa, including mucosal damage, 
increased mucosal permeability and potentially colon cancer-promoting effects
50–52. Increased CDCA and DCA 
levels can inhibit water absorption and induce water and sodium secretion by the colon at concentrations above 
3 mmol/L
53 and can disturb the normal microbiota of the gut, leading to diarrhoea and mucosal inflammation in 
the intestinal contents54. Piglets from the BFLD group had higher CDCA and DCA in their colonic luminal con-
tents than piglets from the BCPD group; this is one of the factors contributing to the higher diarrhoea incidence 
among piglets from the BFLD group.
The Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet contains more active components for the growth of lactic acid bac-
teria and a high lactic acid concentration
55,56. These active components allowed lactic acid-producing bacteria 
to grow better in the intestines of piglets from the BFLD group than in the intestines of piglets from the BCPD 
group. The higher relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria together with the high lactic acid intake resulted in 
piglets from the BFLD group having higher lactic acid in their jejunal and colonic luminal contents than piglets 
from the BCPD group. Excessive lactic acid in the intestine often causes lactic acidosis, which can induce diar -
rhoea
57. Thus, lactic acidosis is the other factor contributing to the higher diarrhoea incidence among piglets from 
the BFLD group than among piglets from the BCPD group.
In summary, ad libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet 
decreased intestinal bacterial diversity and increased intestinal fungal diversity, circulating IL-6 levels, intestinal 
unconjugated bile acid concentrations and diarrhoea incidence. Lactic acidosis, dietary lipid malabsorption and 
the inducing effect of unconjugated bile salts are the underlying causes for the higher diarrhoea incidence among 
piglets fed the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet.
Materials and Methods
Animal Treatment Protocol. Twelve lactating sows (Large White x Landrace, artificially inseminated with 
semen from one Duroc boar) with similar body conditions and suckling piglets were randomly assigned to one 
experimental group and one control group (6 lactating sows + 56 suckling piglets vs 6 lactating sows + 54 suckling 
piglets) at the 7
th day after farrowing. There was no significant difference (P  >  0.05) in the average body weight 
(2.79 ±  0.19 kg/piglet vs 2.85 ±  0.27 kg/piglet) of suckling piglets at 7 days of age between the experimental and 
control groups. All lactating sows were fed the same commercial lactation diet (7.5  kg/d). Piglets in the experi -
mental group and control group had free access to a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet (live Bacillus subtilis: 
12.75 ×  108 CFU/g) or a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented commercial pellet diet (live Bacillus subtilis : 2.80 ×  108 
CFU/g), respectively, from 7 to 31 days of age. All suckling piglets were weaned at 21 days of age. The Bacillus 
subtilis fermented liquid diet was produced using a previously described method
46.
A total of six piglets (each with a body weight closest to the average weight of the litter) in each dietary treat-
ment group (3 males and 3 females) were slaughtered in the morning at 32 days of age according to the protocol 
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Jiangxi Agricultural University.
Sample Collection. Before slaughter, blood was collected with a 10 mL fresh tube from the jugular vein. 
Serum was separated by centrifugation after blood clotting and stored at −  20 °C for the analysis of serum 
cytokines.
After slaughter, the segments of the jejunum and colon were quickly excised. The contents of the jejunum and 
colon were separately collected with 10 mL fresh tubes and immediately stored at − 80 °C for the analysis of pH, 
lactic acid, unconjugated bile acids, microbial composition and differential metabolites.
pH Measurement. A digital pH metre (LP115FK, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) was used to measure the pH 
of samples after calibration with standard buffers (pH 4.0 and 7.0).
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay.  The concentrations of interleukin −  1β , interleukin − 6 and 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha were determined in three replicates for each sample using enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute).
Concentrations of D-/L-lactic acid, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid 
in the intestinal contents were determined in three replicates for each sample using enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Shanghai Enzyme-linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).

Microbiome and Metabolomics Analysis. Genomic DNA of each sample was extracted using the 
E.Z.N.A. Soil DNA kit (OMEGA, USA), and six genomic DNA preparations for each treatment group were 
pooled into three DNA mixtures prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Bacterial genomic DNA was amplified with primers covering the V1–V3 region of the 16 S rRNA bacterial gene; 
the bar-coded primers 27 F and 533 R containing A and B sequencing adaptors (454 Life Sciences) were used. The for-
ward primer (B-27F) was 5′ -CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCGACTAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG
-3′ ; the sequence of the B adaptor is shown in italics and is underlined. The reverse primer (A-533R) was

sequence of the A adaptor is shown in italics and underlined, and the Ns represent a ten-base sample specific 
barcode sequence
58.
Fungal genomic DNA was amplified using the forward primer (A-ITS1) and reverse primer  
(B-ITS4). The forward primer (A-ITS1) was 5′  -CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACGACT  
NNNNNNNNNNTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′ ; the sequence of adaptor A is shown in italics and under -
lined, and the Ns represent a ten-base sample specific barcode sequence. The reverse primer (B-ITS4) was  
5′ -CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCGACTTCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′ , and the sequence of adaptor 
B is shown in italics and underlined.
The protocols for PCR, pyrosequencing, sequence processing and bioinformatic analyses were previ-
ously described 56,59. Differential metabolites were determined using gas chromatography time of flight mass 
spectrometry55.
Diarrhoea Incidence Calculation. Faecal consistency was visually examined at the same time each morn-
ing by the same person during experimental periods. A piglet was considered to have diarrhoea when it devel-
oped a pasty or watery faecal consistency. Diarrhoea incidence was defined as the percentage of animals with 
diarrhoea on a specific day60.
Statistical Analysis. Data analysis was performed with SPSS software (version 13.0). One-way analysis 
of variance (ANOV A) was used to evaluate significant differences between means with a significance level at 
α  =  0.01. Tukey’s test was used to perform comparisons between means. Data were presented as the means ±  SEM.
