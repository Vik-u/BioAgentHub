ABSTRACT
The waste pollution problem caused by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics poses a huge threat to the
environment and human health. As plasticizers, Phthalate esters (PAEs) are widely used in PET production and
become combined pollutants with PET. Synthetic biology make it possible to construct engineered cells for
microbial degradation of combined pollutants of PET and PAEs. PET hydroxylase (PETase) and mono-
hydroxyethyl terephthalate hydroxylase (MHETase) isolated from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 exhibit the capa-
bility to depolymerize PET. However, PET cannot enter cells, thus enzymatic degradation or cell surface
displaying technology of PET hydrolase are the potential strategies. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q was
selected as a chassis strain, which exhibits robust stress tolerance. First, a truncated endogenous outer membrane
protein cOmpA and its variant Signal (OprF)-cOmpA were selected as anchor motifs for exogenous protein to
display on the cell surface. These anchor motifs were fused at the N-terminal of PET hydrolase and MHETase and
transformed into Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q, the mutant strains successfully display the enzymes on cell surface, after
verification by green fluorescent protein labeling and indirect immunofluorescence assay. The resultant strains
also showed the catalytic activity of co-displaying PETase and MHETase for PET biodegradation. Then, the cell
surface displaying PET degradation module was introduced to a JY-Q strain which genome was integrated with
PAEs degrading enzymes and exhibited PAEs degradation ability. The resultant strain JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH
have the ability of degradation PET and PAEs simultaneously. This study provided a promising strain resource
for PET and PAEs pollution control.
1. Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a highly polymerized ester com-
pound resulting from the combination of ethylene glycol (EG) and ter-
ephthalic acid (TPA) through ester bonds, is extensively utilized [ 1 ].
However, the significant accumulation of PET waste in the environment
poses a serious threat to the ecosystem [ 2 ]. Traditional recycling
methods for PET often involve chemical and mechanical approaches,
utilizing hazardous reagents that can lead to secondary contamination
and high energy consumption [ 3 ].
In 2016, a superbug known as Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 demon-
strated the ability to completely break down low-crystallinity PET films
at 30
◦
C. I . sakaiensis 201-F6 utilized PET as its primary carbon and
energy source to support growth [ 4 ]. Genome analysis of I. sakaiensis
uncovered the existence of two distinctive enzymes, PETase and MHE-
Tase, constituting an essential dual enzyme system for PET hydrolysis.
The collaborative action of these enzymes is essential for effectively
breaking down PET [ 5 , 6 ]. The initial enzyme in this system, PETase (EC
3.1.1.101) or FastPETase, functions as an esterase, catalyzing ester
bonds and hydrolyzing polymerized PET molecules. As shown in Fig. S1 ,
hydrolysis of PET results in the release of significant amounts of
monomeric monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET), along with
smaller quantities of bishydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and TPA [ 7 ,
8 ]. As the primary intermediate product, MHET exerts a potent inhibi-
tory effect on PET hydrolase activity [ 9 ]. MHETase (EC 3.1.1.102), a
hydrolase identified in I. sakaiensis , can effectively break down MHET

into TPA and EG through synergy with PETase ( Fig. S1 ), indicating that
I. sakaiensis has evolved a distinct strategy to mitigate the impact of
product inhibition [ 10 ]. The addition of MHETase in PETase reaction
system accelerated PET breakdown twice as rapidly as PETase alone
[ 11 ]. A chimeric two-enzyme system where MHETase is connected to
PETase through glycine-serine linkers of varying lengths (8, 12, or 20
amino acid residues), showed a better degradation efficiency of amor-
phous PET than a mixture of PETase and MHETase [ 12 ]. To address PET
pollution, enzymatic degradation technology employing PET hydrolase
emerges as a safe and sustainable alternative, enabling the environ-
mentally friendly recycling of PET [ 13 ]. In recent years, numerous PET
hydrolases have been identified and characterized from various micro-
organisms, and been engineered to enhance their performance in prac-
tical applications [ 14 – 17 ]. These resulting monomers TPA and EG from
PET biodegradation can undergo additional recycling processes,
demonstrating a green and eco-friendly approach to PET recycling [ 4 ].
In recent years, the advancement of microbial cell surface display
technology has introduced a novel approach to address the challenge of
microbial degradation of PET, given inherent difficulty of PET entering
cells. Cell surface display technology, a protein application method
developed through recombinant DNA technology, involves expressing
and localizing exogenous functional proteins on the surface of specific
bacterial cells for research and practical applications [ 18 , 19 ]. This sys-
tem comprises three essential components: anchor protein, target pro-
tein, and recipient bacterium. An appropriate anchor protein is
necessary for cell surface display technology. Various anchor proteins
have been employed in microbial cell surface display, including outer
membrane proteins, lipoproteins, surface appendage subunits, and
S-layer proteins [ 20 – 22 ]. Among these, outer membrane proteins are
particularly favored as anchor motifs for peptide and protein display due
to their efficient secretion signal, robust anchoring capabilities, and
distinctive transmembrane structure which can offer fusion sites for
target protein. As outer membrane proteins, OmpA, OprF, OmpS, FadL,
LamB, PhoE, OmpC, and Lpp – OmpA have proven successful utilized as
anchor motifs [ 23 – 25 ]. Additionally, co-display system has been suc-
cessfully used mainly in E. coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Pichia
pastoris [ 26 – 29 ].
Recently, surface display systems and whole-cell biocatalysts have
been reported for the expression and functional evaluation of PET hy-
drolases [ 30 , 31 ]. By employing DNA recombination, the PET hydrolase
gene is incorporated into a cell surface display expression vector. This
genetic modification ensures the fixation of PET hydrolase on the mi-
crobial cell surface through anchor proteins. The resulting displayed
enzyme retains high biological activity, effectively addressing chal-
lenges associated with limited direct substrate contact and activity loss
during extraction processes [ 32 ]. Additionally, PETase surface display
system and MHETase surface display system have been successfully
constructed in yeast, and superior thermal stability and increased con-
version rates compared to purified enzymes was observed [ 33 , 34 ].
Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q, isolated from waste tobacco aqueous extract,
exhibited robust stress resistance, with a mature genetic operating sys-
tem, and a downstream pathway for PET degradation from proto-
catechuic acid (PCA) into the TCA cycle [ 35 , 36 ]. Thus, Pseudomonas sp.
JY-Q was selected as the recipient strain for cell surface display in this
study. The truncated OmpA and its variants in strain JY-Q was selected
as anchor motifs to construct non-tandem double-enzyme co-display
strains for PETase and MHETase. In addition, FASTPETase- MHETase
tandem double-enzyme co-displaying strains were created. This stra-
tegic design aimed to explore the biocatalytic potential of recombinant
bacteria in displaying PET hydrolase on the cell surface.
Phthalate esters (PAEs) are a class of plasticizers widely used in
plastic production, and release of PAEs cause environmental pollution
because PAEs are endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Due to the wide-
spread use of PET around the world, several studies have reported that
the combined contamination of PET and PAEs is a serious environmental
problem [ 37 – 39 ]. PAEs esterase gene was integrated into the genome of
JY-Q, for final combining both PAEs and PET degrading ability in JY-Q.
The esterase genes were mined from Rhodococcus sp. AH-ZY2 which
exhibited strong degradation ability for multiple PAEs. The esterase
EstR1 encoded by AH-ZY2- estR1 has a similarity of 57.88 % with the
reported carboxyesterase, and is predicted to be a type III enzyme (with
high activity on phthalate diesters). The esterase EstR4 encoded by
AH-ZY2- estR4 has a sequence similarity of up to 100 % with the reported
MehpH esterase, indicating that EstR4 is a mono-ethylhexylphthalate
degrading esterase and belongs to type II enzyme (with high activity
on phthalate monoesters). Heterologous expression of esterase genes
was performed, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
results showed that EstR1 and EstR4 had the function of degrading PAEs
[ 40 ]. Then, AH-ZY2 -estR1 and AH-ZY2- estR4 genes were inserted into
the JY-Q genome via replacing RS11060 and upp gene through homol-
ogous recombination, respectively. Finally, the resultant recombinant
strain JY-Q Δ RS11060::estR1 Δ upp::estR4 (JY-Q-R1-R4) can simulta-
neously degrade both long and short chains of PAEs to phthalic acid
(PA). In this study, sfm-6his (encoding co-displayed tandem
FASTPETase-MHETase) was integrated into the JY-Q-R1-R4 genome to
obtain JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM. Moreover, gene cluster tphA2

construct JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH, aiming to obtain a strain that can
degrade PET or BHET completely. Ability of these engineered strains to
degrade PET and PAEs combined pollution was investigated ( Fig. 1 ).

2.3. High performance liquid chromatography analysis
HPLC was employed to assess the variations in BHET, MHET, and
TPA. A mixture of 100 μ L of the supernatant sample and 300 μ L of a 20
mM phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with a pH of 2.50 (con-
taining 20 % dimethyl sulfoxide) was prepared and subsequently filtered
through a 0.22 μ m filter membrane. The analysis was carried out using
liquid chromatography on ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.60 mm × 250
mm). The mobile phase consisted of 50 % ( v / v ) chromatographed
methanol and 50 % ( v / v ) 20 mM PBS (pH = 2.50) a flow rate of 1 mL/
min. Detection was performed at a wavelength of 245 nm, with a
detection time of 7 min and an injection volume of 10 μ L. The detection
of DBP, DEHP and PA was according to previous study [ 40 ].
2.4. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence microscopy analysis
Both confocal microscopy and inverted fluorescence microscopy
serve as tools for observing the fluorescence of strain cells. Confocal
microscopy allows for a layered examination of cells. The recombinant
plasmid was introduced into strain JY-Q through electroporation, fol-
lowed by plating on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin. The plated
samples were then incubated overnight at 37
◦
C. Single colonies were
chosen for validation and inoculated in ampicillin-containing LB me-
dium. The culture was incubated on a shaker at 180 rpm until reaching
an OD
600
of 0.6 – 0.8. Initially, the culture was maintained at 22
◦
C and
180 rpm for 30 min before induction by adding 1 mM IPTG. Following
induction, E. coli was cultured at a low temperature for 16 – 18 h, and
Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q was cultured at a low temperature for 24 h. The
bacterial culture was washed three times with 1 × PBS, and the samples
were then prepared for microscopic observation. The prepared slides
were placed under a laser scanning confocal microscope STELLARIS
STED (Leica) and an inverted fluorescence microscope EVOS M5000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The focal length was adjusted, and the
fluorescence patterns and positions were observed before capturing
photographs for documentation.
2.5. PET film degradation and field emission scanning electron
microscopy analysis
The PET film underwent cutting into 2 cm × 2 cm squares and
received pre-treatment according to previous study [ 41 ]. Recombinant
bacteria were cultured, collected, and concentrated through centrifu-
gation, then pipetted onto PET membranes that had undergone
pre-treatment. These reaction mixtures were left to incubate in a water
bath at 30
◦
C for a duration of 28 days, during which the bacterial so-
lution was changed weekly. Following the 28-day incubation period, the
PET film was removed, washed, and dried in a 60
◦
C oven. The blank
control group underwent treatment with an equivalent volume of BSM
medium. Subsequently, the washed and dried PET film sample under-
went surface metallization in an ion sputtering coater and was then
examined and imaged using a scanning electron microscope.
2.6. Indirect immunofluorescence assays
Initially, the OD
600
of both the negative control group samples and
experimental group samples was carefully maintained between 0.4 and
0.6. Then, the samples were treated with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10
min at room temperature to facilitate cell fixation. Next, the samples
were washed twice with pre-chilled sterilized PBS and resuspended with
200 μ L of primary antibody dilution, and incubated overnight in a 4
◦
C
freezer. The next day, the samples were removed from the refrigerator
and left at room temperature for 10 min before being washed three times
with sterilized PBS. 200 μ L of secondary antibody reagent was added to
the samples and incubated at 37
◦
C for 1 h in the dark. Finally, the
samples were washed twice with sterilized PBS and prepared for
observation. Prior to mounting, slides and coverslips were picked up
with tweezers and immersed in a beaker filled with 90 % ethanol, where
the slides were washed with ethanol.
2.7. AlphaFold 2 modeling
The AlphaFold2 AI system, developed by DeepMind, has the capa-
bility to directly generate structural models of protein-protein com-
plexes based on sequence information. A significant portion of the
prediction models align closely with experimental protein structure
models [ 42 ]. An index, pLDDT, was introduced to assess the reliability of
monomer structure predicted by AlphaFold2. This index ranges from
0 to 100, with higher value indicating greater confidence in the pre-
diction model. In this study, AlphaFold2 software was employed to
predict the following complexes: anchor protein, anchor
protein-linker-PETase, anchor protein-linker-MHETase, and
FASTPETase-MHETase.
2.8. Degradation test
Cells were cultivated overnight in LB medium supplemented corre-
sponding antibiotics, then collected by centrifugation and washes three
times with sterilized PBS. The collected cells were then resuspended
with PBS. Either 4 g of pre-treated PET powder or 200 mg/L of BHET and
MHET were introduced to the cell suspension. The reaction mixtures
were incubated at 30
◦
C, and the supernatant was periodically sampled.
The changes in substrate consumption and product formation were

2.9. Biodegradation of combined pollutants of polyethylene terephthalate
and phthalate esters by JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM and JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH
Sfm-6his (encoding cell surface displayed FASTPETase and MHETase,
amplified from plasmid p519n- signal(oprF)-cOmpa-fastpetase-mhetase-
his ) was integrated into the genome of the strain JY-Q-R1-R4 to obtain
JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM. To achieve a complete degradation of PET and BHET
by JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM, TPA degradation gene clusters, tphA2

from strain Comamonas sp. strain E6 [ 43 ] were synthesized and inte-
grated into JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM to obtain JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH. Ability of
JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM and JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH to degrade PET and PAEs
combined pollution was investigated. Strains were inoculated into 5 mL
LB liquid medium and cultured overnight at 37
◦
C, 180 rpm, and 2 %
overnight culture were transferred to 100 mL fresh LB liquid medium
and incubated until the OD
600
reach to 0.6 – 0.8 (mid-log phase),
respectively. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5
min, obtaining pellets were washed with PBS twice and resuspended to
obtain a cell suspension with OD
600
= 10. The cell suspensions were
used to detect its ability to transform BHET and DBP. The initial con-
centration of BHET and DBP was both 200 mg/L. DBP was used because
it is one of the most commonly used PAEs in PET production. Cell sus-
pension of strain JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM and JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH were used
as experimental group, cell suspensions of JY-Q-R1-R4 and wild-type
JY-Q were used as control group, and group without cell suspension
was set as the negative control. Each group was conducted three parallel
repeats, the substrate consumption and product formation were detec-
ted after being cultured at 37
◦
C for 16, 48 and 72 h.
Additionally, PET film and a mixture of DBP and DEHP (DBP is a
typical short-chain PAEs and DEHP is a typical long-chain PAEs) were
treated by JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH, JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM, and JY-Q-R1-R4,
meanwhile a group that treated by wild-type JY-Q was used as control
strain, and another group that treated by no strain with PBS containing
substrate only was used as negative control group. PET films were pre-
treated and incubated with cell suspensions for 28 days before detection
by a Hitachi S-4700 (Hitachi) for SEM analysis. DBP and DEHP were
detected by HPLC after incubation for 16 h.

Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q (NZ_CP011525) deposited in NCBI revealed 10
OmpA proteins. The OmpA protein in Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q exhibited
high sequence similarity to the previously reported outer membrane
protein used in the cell surface systems of other Pseudomonas strains.
This study used OmpA protein (WP_003248667.1) in JY-Q, composed of
344 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 37.0 kDa, as the anchor
protein. The protein’s model was generated using AlphaFold2, and
Fig. S2 illustrates the three-dimensional structural diagram of OmpA. As
a non-specific channel protein, OmpA allows the passage of small
hydrophiles and plays a structural role in maintaining cell shape and
outer membrane integrity.
In theory, all four outer loops of OmpA could potentially serve as the
insertion site for the target protein for cell surface display. However,
previous studies indicated that the outer loop of OmpA had specific
requirements on the molecular weight and charge of the inserted pro-
tein. Seung et al. achieved successful surface display of lipase using the
truncated outer membrane protein OprF in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an
anchor motif [23]. Alignment analysis revealed that the conserved
domain of OprF protein was identical to that of the outer membrane
OmpA (WP_003248667.1) in JY-Q. To improve the capacity of OmpA to

receive exogenous inserted protein and reach a successful protein sur-
face display, OmpA underwent truncation and a truncated OmpA
designated as cOmpA was constructed. The target protein was inserted
into the fourth loop of cOmpA, enabling the surface display of the
enzyme. Considering the essential role of the signal peptide in display
efficiency, the signal peptide of truncated cOmpA was replaced with the
signal peptide of OprF, resulting in Signal(OprF)-cOmpA, which was
also employed as the surface-displayed anchor protein.
3.2. Verification of the surface display system in JY-Q
The performance of cOmpA and Signal(OprF)-cOmpA were deter-
mined by reporter gene. Fluorescent proteins, such as GFP, serve as
valuable reporter genes for detecting gene expression, regulation, and
fusion tags, enabling the observation of localization, migration, and
conformational changes in protein molecules. In this study, the green
fluorescent protein gene, gfp (derived from plasmid p519n-gfp), was
employed as the reporter gene to construct cOmpA-gfp and Signal
(OprF)-cOmpA-gfp. These two fusion genes were ligated into the
expression vector pMMB67EH (digested by Sal I and Hin dIII) to obtain
pMMB67EH-cOmpA-gfp and pMMB67EH-Signal(OprF)-cOmpA-gfp,
respectively. These two resulting plasmids were imported to JY-Q to
obtain JY-Q/pMMB67EH-Signal(OprF)-cOmpA-gfp and JY-Q/
pMMB67EH- cOmpA-gfp. These two recombinant bacteria were
cultured and underwent induction with IPTG at low-temperature for 24
h, and then fluorescence was observed using inverted fluorescence mi-
croscopy and confocal microscopy. Under inverted fluorescence micro-
scopy, green fluorescence was evident in both JY-Q/pMMB67EH-Signal
(OprF)-cOmpA-gfp and JY-Q/pMMB67EH-cOmpA-gfp strains. The
fluorescence distribution in JY-Q/pMMB67EH- Signal(OprF)-cOmpA-
gfp appeared more uniform compared to JY-Q/pMMB67EH-cOmpA-gfp
when observed by confocal microscopy ( Fig. 2 ). In a previous study,
Lpp-OmpA was utilized as an anchor protein, and an immune response
was employed to identify the location of the target protein. Results
showed that fluorescence could be observed in various regions around
the periphery of bacteria, which indicated the successfully display of
target protein by Lpp-OmpA [ 46 ]. Gallus et al. also utilized the anchor
protein Lpp-OmpA for displaying the target protein on the surface of
E. coli . In bacteria carrying the Lpp-OmpA-GFP protein, fluorescence
was observed at the cell periphery under the microscope [ 20 ]. The
fluorescence distribution of the fusion protein cOmpA-GFP and Signal
(OprF)-cOmpA-GFP were similar with that in previous study, which
indicated that the surface display system was constructed successful in
JY-Q.
3.3. Heterologous expression and enzyme activity determination of
PETase and MHETase in Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q
In this investigation, the petase and mhetase genes from I. sakaiensis
201-F6 underwent codon optimization before being introduced to JY-Q.
The constitutive expression plasmid p519n-gfp was digested with Xba I
and Eco RI, and the green fluorescent protein gene on the plasmid was
replaced with the target gene ( petase and mhetase carrying His-tag). Then
the obtaining expression vectors p519n- petase-6his and p519n- mhetase-
6his were transformed into JY-Q, generating JY-Q/p519n- petase-6his
and JY-Q/p519n- mhetase-6his . The resultant strains were cultured, then
cells were harvested and broken by an ultrasonic cell disruptor to obtain
crude enzyme solutions. Further purification involved nickel column
purification and gradient elution with imidazole was implemented to
yield purified PETase and MHETase. The protein concentration of both
crude and purified enzyme solutions was determined by BCA method.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
was used to analyze the purified protein. SDS-PAGE results confirmed
the successful isolation of purification of PETase-His protein ( Fig. 3 A,
lane 4) and MHETase-His protein ( Fig. 3 B, lane 13). The size of the re-
combinant protein was accordance with theoretically calculated mo-
lecular weights of 31.0 kDa for PETase-His and 65.3 kDa for MHETase-
His, respectively. Enzyme activity assays for both crude and pure
enzyme of PETase and MHETase were performed. HPLC was used to
detect substrate and product changes during enzyme reaction system.
PETase can hydrolyze ester bonds in PET, breakdown PET into small
molecules such as BHET, MHET, and TPA. In order to detect the sub-
strate consumption more conveniently, BHET was used as the substrate
of PETase. Results showed that PETas-His can catalyze BHET to produce
MHET and TPA ( Fig. 3 C). The data demonstrated the activity of the
PETase synthesized in this study. In the MHET degradation assay, both
the crude and pure enzyme solutions of MHETase efficiently degraded
MHET, leading to the formation of TPA ( Fig. 3 D). These results indicated
that the codon-optimized MHETase could be heterologously expressed
in JY-Q and possessed catalytic activity.

3.4. PETase and MHETase displayed on the surface of Pseudomonas sp.
JY-Q
For the surface display of PETase in JY-Q, a recombinant plasmid
p519n- signal(oprF)- cOmpa-petase , abbreviated as p519n-SOP-his, was
engineered by combining the anchor protein signal(oprF)-cOmpa gene
sequence with the petase-his gene sequence into the expression plasmid
p519n-gfp. The resulting recombinant plasmid was introduced into
Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q by electroporation, yielding the single-enzyme
display strain JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his . PET and BHET degradation

experiments were conducted by JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his to test its
performance.
The BHET degradation experiments conducted on the single-enzyme
display strain JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his ( Fig. 4 A) revealed the catalytic ac-
tivity of the PETase displayed on the surface of Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q.
The enzyme efficiently degraded BHET, producing MHET and TPA as
products. PET film degradation experiments were carried out using the
JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his strain, and the results of scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM) showed noticeable damage to the PET films after treatment
with the JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his recombinant strain ( Fig. 4 C). In summary,
these findings demonstrated that the surface displayed PETase exhibited
catalytic activity in JY-Q cells. JY-Q/p519n- SOP-his can effectively
degrade PET and serves as the initial PET degradation module in the co-
display system.
The recombinant plasmid p519n- signal(oprF)-cOmpa-mhetase-flag ,
created by ligating the signal(oprF)-cOmpa sequence (encoding anchor
protein) and mhetase-flag sequence (encoding MHETase with a Flag-tag
in the C-terminal) into the expression plasmid p519n-gfp, was designed
for the purpose of showcasing MHETase on the cell surface of JY-Q. The
plasmid was introduced into Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q by electroporation,
resulting in the MHETase single enzyme display strain JY-Q/p519n-
SOM-flag . MHET degradation experiments demonstrated that 100 mg/L
of MHET was entirely degraded to TPA by JY-Q/p519n- SOM-flag
( Fig. 4 B). This indicates that the MHETase displayed on the surface of
JY-Q cells exhibits catalytic activity and can be incorporated into the co-
display system as the second PET degradation module.
3.5. Dual-enzyme display system construction and the cell surface display
verification
Two distinct construction strategies were employed to achieve the
co-display of two enzymes on the cell surface of JY-Q. The first one was
constructing a non-tandem two-enzyme co-display strain and the second
one was constructing a tandem two-enzyme co-display strain.
For the construction of the non-tandem two-enzyme co-display
strain, PETase and MHETase encoding genes were designed to inte-
grate into genome of JY-Q or insert into a self-replicable plasmid. The
integration site selection was based on genomic and transcriptome data
of strain JY-Q. The FPKM value of the gene RS09985 , encoding a hy-
pothetical protein, was higher than other genes in both the glucose and
nicotine culture groups. This indicated that the endogenous promoter
P
RS09985
was stronger than other promoters, thereby capable of
enhancing the expression of target genes. Consequently, the gene
RS09985 , controlled by the robust promoter P
RS09985
, was chosen as the
gene replacement site. The fusion gene signal(oprF)-cOmpa-petase-his ,
designated as SOP-his , was integrated into the JY-Q genome using sacB
counter-selection. The resultant recombinant strain, JY-Q Δ RS09985::
SOP-his , was obtained to display PETase on the cell surface. The BHET
degradation experiment ( Fig. 5 A) showed that SOP-6his driven by the
robust endogenous promoter of JY-Q exhibited catalytic activity.

The non-tandem double-enzyme co-display strain, JY-Q Δ RS09985::
SOP-his/p519n-SOM-flag , was generated by introducing the MHETase
display plasmid p519n- SOM-flag into the recombinant strain JY-
Q Δ RS09985::SOP-his . BHET and MHET degradation experiments
revealed that JY-Q Δ RS09985::SOP-his/p519n-SOM-flag exhibited cata-
lytic activity of both PETase ( Fig. 5 C) and MHETase ( Fig. 5 D). To further
confirm the successful display of PETase and MHETase on the cell sur-
face of JY-Q, an indirect immunofluorescence localization verification
was conducted. PETase, as the first enzyme displayed on the surface,
carried a His-tag that bound to a primary mouse anti-His antibody.
Subsequently, it was treated with a green-fluorescently labeled anti-
mouse antibody (secondary antibody), causing the cells to fluoresce
green under a microscope. The MHETase, harboring a Flag tag at its C-
terminus, was targeted using a primary rabbit anti-Flag antibody. After
treatment with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody labeled with red fluo-
rescence, the cells fluoresced red. Observation of the non-tandem dou-
ble-enzyme co-display strain JY-Q Δ RS09985::SOP-his /p519n- SOM-flag
under an inverted fluorescence microscope following binding with pri-
mary and secondary antibodies ( Fig. 5 E) confirmed the successful
display of PETase and MHETase on the surface of JY-Q, respectively.
FASTPETase, a novel enzyme developed through machine learning
algorithms based on the natural PETase. This enzyme exhibits efficient
plastic degradation within a temperature range of 28
◦
C – 52
◦
C, sur-
passing the depolymerization rate of natural PETase. The FASTPETase
was used in construction of the tandem two-enzyme co-display strain. To
obtain the sequence information of FASTPETase, the PDB protein
database was referenced, and the gene underwent codon optimization
before being imported into JY-Q. The single-enzyme display strain, JY-
Q/p519n -signal(oprF)-cOmpa-fastpetase-flag (abbreviated as JY-Q/
p519n- SOF ), was then constructed. Subsequently, the tandem dual-
enzyme co-display strain, JY-Q/p519n- signal(oprF)-cOmpa-fastpetase-
mhetase-his (abbreviated as JY-Q/p519n- sfm-6his ), was obtained
( Fig. 6 A).
Verification of the tandem double-enzyme co-display strain was
conducted in three aspects: (1) SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the het-
erologous expression of the chimerase FASTPETase-MHETase in JY-Q,
with the expected chimerase size at 92.6 KDa, demonstrating success-
ful expression and purification of the target protein ( Fig. 6 B, lane 4). (2)
BHET degradation experiments were performed on both the tandem
double-enzyme co-exhibiting strain JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his and the
strain JY-Q/p519n- SOF . Results revealed that the strain JY-Q/p519n-
SOF which displaying FASTPETase, can degrade BHET and produce a
substantial amount of MHET. In contrast, the tandem two-enzyme co-
display strain JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his can completely degrade BHET to
TPA ( Fig. 6 C), indicating catalytic activity of the chimerase displayed on
the cell surface, which encompassing both PETase and MHETase activ-
ities. (3) Indirect immunofluorescence was employed for cell surface
localization verification. JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his , carrying a His-tag, was
bound by a mouse anti-His antibody and subsequently treated with a
green fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody. Fluorescence microscopy
revealed the detection of green fluorescence, confirming the successful
display of the FASTPETase-MHETase chimerase on the cell surface
( Fig. 6 D).
The strains generated through the aforementioned two strategies,
namely JY-Q/ Δ RS09985::SOP-his /p519n- SOM-flag and JY-Q/p519n-
SOFM-his , underwent a PET film degradation test and a PET powder
degradation test. In the PET film degradation test the surface erosion of
the PET film was detected using scanning electron microscopy, and
detectable PET damage was observed for both JY-Q/ Δ RS09985::SOP-
his /p519n- SOM-flag and JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his strains. However, con-
trol groups including wild-type JY-Q, JY-Q/p519n- FM-6his , and JY-Q/
p519n- MF-6his , displayed no membrane damage. This further confirmed
that the PETase and MHETase in the strains JY-Q Δ RS09985::SOP-his /
p519n- SOM-flag and JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his had been successfully dis-
played on the cell surface and exerted a catalytic effect in degrading PET
( Fig. 7 ). The degradation of PET powder by strains JY-Q Δ RS09985::SOP-
his /p519n- SOM-flag and JY-Q/p519n- SOFM-his was also conducted, and
intermediate metabolites were detected ( Fig. S3 ). It can be seen that the
degradation efficiency can be further improved.

3.6. Degradation of combined pollutants of polyethylene terephthalate
and phthalate esters by JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM and JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH
During the degradation of combined pollution of BHET and DBP,
there was no significant change in substrate concentration during the
negative control group and wild-type JY-Q group. Strain JY-Q-R1-R4
could transform DBP to produce PA. JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM can degrade
both BHET and DBP simultaneously, but complete degradation of BHET
and DBP was not achieved, as TPA and PA accumulated. However, with
the integration of tphA2

, JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH can degrade
BHET completely ( Fig. 8 ).
Moreover, JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM showed obvious green fluorescence by
indirect immunofluorescence assay ( Fig. S4A ), and no fluorescence re-
action was detected in the control group of chassis strain JY-Q-R1-R4
( Fig. S4B ), indicating that sfm-6his successfully demonstrated the
enzyme to the cell surface after integration into genome of strain JY-Q-
R1-R4.
Degradation of DBP by JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH is efficient (98 %
removal in 16 h), while removal of the long-chain PAEs DEHP was 45 %.
The results indicated that JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH could degrade both
short and long-chain PAEs. Besides, the control strain JY-Q and negative
control group showed no degradation of DBP and DEHP ( Fig. 9 ). After 28
days of incubation, the PET films in each group were removed and the
surface erosion of the PET film was detected using scanning electron
microscopy, and detectable PET damage was observed for JY-Q-R1-R4-
SFM group ( Fig. S5A ) and JY-Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH group ( Fig. 10 C).
However, control group, wild-type JY-Q and JY-Q-R1-R4 displayed no
membrane damage ( Fig. 10 A – B and Fig. S5B ). Moreover, when cells
suspension was supplemented during the incubation period, the surface
erosion of the PET film was more distinct ( Fig. 10 D). These results
confirmed that the PETase, MHETase, TPADO, DCDDH and esterase in
the strains had been successfully expressed and exerted a catalytic effect

in degrading combined pollutants of PET and PAEs.
4. Discussion
Enzyme-based PET degradation is an emerging technology and
environmentally friendly compared with traditional physical or chemi-
cal degradation processes. Given that PET is a highly crystalline poly-
mer, it is difficult for PET to crossing cell membranes. Surface display
systems and whole-cell catalysts have become prominent choices for
plastic degradation. The co-display of PETase and MHETase on the
surface of Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q demonstrates the feasibility of PET
biodegradation. In this investigation, endogenous anchoring proteins
Signal(OprF)-cOmpA and cOmpA, suitable for cell surface display, were
identified and engineered in Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q. The efficacy of these
two anchored proteins for surface display was confirmed through the
localization of green fluorescent protein and indirect immunofluores-
cence experiments. By utilizing the aforementioned anchor proteins,
PETase, MHETase, and the chimeric FASTPETase-MHETase were suc-
cessfully displayed on the surface of JY-Q cells. It was established that
the PET hydrolase exhibited catalytic activity, rendering it suitable for
PET biodegradation. The efficiency of the dual enzyme ’ s surface display
will be further optimized in subsequent studies.
This research not only presents a strategy for biodegrading PET but
also showcases the versatility of employing Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q as a
platform for expressing and surface displaying PET hydrolase. This
finding holds relevance in inspiring the development of other high-
performance collaborative surface display systems. Furthermore,
genomic analysis revealed a downstream pathway for PET degradation
in Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q, laying the groundwork for subsequent efforts
to construct a comprehensive metabolic pathway for PET degradation in
JY-Q.
In this study, JY-Q-R1-R4, which has integrated estR1 and estR4
esterase genes, was used as the chassis strain. The genes encoding an-
chor and PET hydrolase fusion protein, as well as genes encoding TPA
1,2-dioxygenase and 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4- dicarbox-
ylate dehydrogenase, were integrated into the genome to construct a
recombinant strain Q-R1-R4-SFM-TPH that can degrade PET and PAEs
at the same time. Compared with the E. coli and yeast display platforms
used in previous studies to display PET hydrolase enzymes, the chassis
strains selected in this study were PAEs-degrading strains and were
highly stress-resistant and able to adapt to harsh environments. In
addition, in the selection of anchor proteins, we screened the endoge-
nous anchor protein OmpA, truncated it and replaced the signal peptide,
and constructed an anchoring motif that was more suitable for the
chassis strain to construct a reasonable surface display platform.
In general, our research provides new ideas and methods for the
biodegradation of combined pollutants of PET and PAEs. Through the
precise selection of chassis strains, the ingenious construction of the
display system, and the establishment of the dual-enzyme co-display
system, it is potential for successfully degradation of combined pollut-
ants of PET and PAEs.
