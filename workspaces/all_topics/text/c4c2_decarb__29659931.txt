Abstract
The high energy cost and apparently low plasticity of C 4 photosynthesis compared with C3 photosynthesis may limit 
the productivity and distribution of C 4 plants in low light (LL) environments. C 4 photosynthesis evolved numerous 
times, but it remains unclear how different biochemical subtypes perform under LL. We grew eight C4 grasses belong-
ing to three biochemical subtypes [NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and phospho-
enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK)] under shade (16% sunlight) or control (full sunlight) conditions and measured 
their photosynthetic characteristics at both low and high light. We show for the first time that LL (during measurement 
or growth) compromised the CO 2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) to a greater extent in NAD-ME than in PEP-CK 
or NADP-ME C4 grasses by virtue of a greater increase in carbon isotope discrimination (∆ P) and bundle sheath CO2 
leakiness (ϕ), and a greater reduction in photosynthetic quantum yield (Φmax). These responses were partly explained 
by changes in the ratios of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)/initial Rubisco activity and dark respiration/
photosynthesis (R
d/A). Shade induced a greater photosynthetic acclimation in NAD-ME than in NADP-ME and PEP-CK 
species due to a greater Rubisco deactivation. Shade also reduced plant dry mass to a greater extent in NAD-ME 
and PEP-CK relative to NADP-ME grasses. In conclusion, LL compromised the co-ordination of the C
4 and C3 cycles 
and, hence, the efficiency of the CCM to a greater extent in NAD-ME than in PEP-CK species, while CCM efficiency 
was less impacted by LL in NADP-ME species. Consequently, NADP-ME species are more efficient at LL, which could 
explain their agronomic and ecological dominance relative to other C
4 grasses.

Introduction
C4 photosynthesis is characterized by the operation of a CO2-
concentrating mechanism (CCM) whereby atmospheric CO2 
is initially fixed in the mesophyll cells (MCs) into C 4 acids. 
These acids are subsequently decarboxylated in the bundle 
sheath cells (BSCs) releasing CO 2 where Rubisco, the ulti-
mate CO2-fixing enzyme, is located (Hatch, 1987). The CCM 
serves to raise the CO2 concentration in the BSCs, thus curb-
ing photorespiration and CO 2-saturating photosynthesis at

current ambient CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) under high light 
(Hatch, 1987; Kanai and Edwards, 1999). The CCM requires 
additional energy costs compared with the C3 cycle associated 
with the regeneration of the C 3 precursor phosphoenolpyru-
vate (PEP) and the overcycling of CO 2. Nevertheless, under 
warm temperatures, C4 plants have a superior photosynthetic 
quantum yield (Ф max) relative to C 3 plants (Ehleringer and 
Björkman, 1977; Pearcy et al., 1981; Ehleringer and Pearcy, 
1983; Zhu et  al., 2008). This explains the ecological domi-
nance of C4 plants in open, high light (HL) environments and 
their disproportionately high global productivity relative to 
their small taxonomic representation (Ehleringer et al., 1997; 
Brown, 1999; Edwards et al., 2010).
Despite their success under HL, C
4 plants experience low 
light (LL) under natural conditions. C4 crops and grasses can 
form dense canopies where a significant proportion of the leaf 
area is shaded, in addition to short-term LL exposures during 
the course of the day (Sage, 2014; Ort et al., 2015). Numerous 
C
4 grasses are adapted to the shade of the forest interior (Sage 
and Pearcy, 2000). Shading is expected to increase in the 
understorey of C
4 grass-dominated ecosystems with predicted 
woody thickening under increasing atmospheric [CO2] (Bond 
and Midgley, 2012; Saintilan and Rogers, 2015). Consequently, 
it is important to investigate the efficiency of C 4 photosyn-
thesis under LL across diverse C4 plants.
C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently many times, 
resulting in three biochemical subtypes named after the pri-
mary C
4 acid decarboxylase enzyme found in the BSCs, and 
they are NADP-malic enzyme (ME), NAD-ME, and phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) (Hatch 1987). 
PEP-CK operates as a secondary decarboxylase in many C
4 
species (Leegood and Walker, 2003; Furbank, 2011; Sharwood 
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). However, the primary decarb-
oxylase is generally associated with a suite of anatomical, bio-
chemical, and physiological features (Gutierrez et  al., 1974; 
Hattersley, 1992; Kanai and Edwards, 1999; Ghannoum et al., 
2011), making it a suitable classification basis for the purpose 
of the current study investigating the efficiency of the C
4-
CCM. The grass family includes species from all biochemical 
subtypes (Sage and Pearcy, 2000; Edwards et al., 2010), but 
our understanding of how different C
4 subtypes respond and 
acclimate to LL environments remains limited.
It is well demonstrated that the C 4 subtypes have differ -
ent leaf dry matter carbon isotope composition (δ 13C) and 
Фmax. In particular, C 4 grasses with the NAD-ME subtype 
(i.e. NAD-ME as the primary decarboxylase) show lower 
leaf δ
13C (i.e. more negative values which are closer to the C3 
range) and Фmax, while NADP-ME and PEP-CK species (i.e. 
those with NADP-ME and PEP-CK as the primary decar -
boxylases, respectively) show the highest and intermediate 
values, respectively (Hattersley, 1982; Ehleringer and Pearcy, 
1983). There is a paucity of data comparing the response to 
shade of leaf δ
13C and Фmax of the various C4 subtypes. Using 
14 C4 grasses, Buchmann et al. (1996) found that leaf δ13C 
values of NAD-ME species were most impacted by shade, 
followed by PEP-CK and NADP-ME species. In a large sur-
vey of C
4 grasses, von Caemmerer et al. (2014) reported that 
leaf δ13C was equally affected by growing season irradiance 
(winter versus summer) in NAD-ME and NADP-ME grasses. 
This discrepancy may be due to the fact that carbon isotope 
composition and discrimination are not significantly affected 
until photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) decreases 
below 700 μmol m
–2 s–1 (Buchmann et al., 1996).
In C4 plants, both photosynthetic and post-photosynthetic 
discrimination factors determine leaf δ13C (Farquhar, 1983; von 
Caemmerer et al., 2014). Reduced leaf δ13C under LL may be 
attributed to increased photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimin-
ation (Δ
P) and BSC leakiness (ϕ) as a result of reduced CCM effi-
ciency (Henderson et al., 1992). For example, LL may reduce the 
activity of the C3 cycle to a greater extent than that of the C4 cycle, 
leading to greater overcycling. In turn, this will lead to higher 
ϕ and energetic cost of operating the C
4-CCM. Consequently, 
we hypothesized that LL will differentially compromise the C4-
CCM efficiency depending on the biochemical subtype. In par-
ticular, we predicted that LL will increase leaf δ13C and ΔP, and 
reduce Фmax to a greater extent in NAD-ME grasses, followed by 
PEP-CK and NADP-ME species (Hypothesis 1).
Short- and long-term photosynthetic responses to LL 
are expected to differ. Following long-term exposure to 
LL (shade), the photosynthetic apparatus commonly accli-
mates to maximize light use efficiency (Björkman, 1981; 
Boardman, 1977; Sage and McKown, 2006). Depending on 
the plant species and ecotype, acclimation may be minimal 
or profound (Ward and Woolhouse, 1986a, b; Björkman and 
Holmgren, 1966). Overall, acclimation of C
3 and C 4 plants 
to shade involves partitioning of photosynthetic nitrogen (N) 
away from Rubisco towards the light-harvesting processes 
(Boardman, 1977; Björkman, 1981; Hikosaka and Terashima, 
1995; Evans and Poorter, 2001; Walters, 2005; Tazoe et al., 
2006; Pengelly et al., 2010). NAD-ME species are known to 
have higher leaf N content and a greater N fraction invested 
in Rubisco relative to NADP-ME species (Ghannoum et al., 
2005). Hence, the former subtype may have a greater flexibil-
ity to reallocate N under shade especially since, as mentioned 
above, LL is expected to reduce the activity of the C
3 cycle (e.g. 
Rubisco) more than the C 4 cycle [e.g. phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxylase (PEPC)]. However, optimal photosynthetic accli-
mation of C
4 photosynthesis to shade is expected to involve 
parallel reductions in the activities of the C 3 and C4 cycles in 
order to curb leakiness and maintain an efficient CCM and 
quantum yield (Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014a, b), which does 
not seem to be the case for NAD-ME species in Buchmann 
et al. (1996). Consequently, we hypothesized that NAD-ME 
species will exhibit a greater photosynthetic acclimation in 
response to shade relative to the other two subtypes. This will 
manifest as a greater photosynthetic down-regulation and 
higher leakiness in the LL-acclimated leaves of NAD-ME 
species relative to the other two subtypes (Hypothesis 2).
To address these two hypotheses, we investigated the 
photosynthetic responses of eight C
4 grasses belonging to 
three biochemical subtypes (Table 1) to short-term (200 µmol 
quanta m –2 s –1 versus 2000  µmol quanta m –2 s –1) and long-
term (16% versus 100% sunlight; Supplementray Fig.  S1A 
at JXB online) light treatments. We sought to elucidate the 
underlying mechanisms by describing changes in photosyn-
thetic rates and enzyme activities, and in the CCM efficiency

as described by leakiness and quantum yield. Our results 
indicated that NADP-ME species are generally more efficient 
at LL due to effective co-ordination of the C
4 and C3 cycles.
Materials and methods
Plant culture
The experiment was conducted in a naturally lit glasshouse chamber 
(5 m3) during the Australian summer. Within the chamber, an alu-
minium structure (1.5 × 5 m 3) was covered with white shade cloth 
(Premium Hortshade Light, Model No. 428976, Coolaroo, VIC, 
Australia). A PPFD of ~100 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 was achieved inside 
the shade structure by adjusting the number of cloth layers. The 
impact of heavy shade during cloudy days was minimized by sup-
plementing external growth light (LimiGrow Pro S325, Emeryville, 
CA, USA) to achieve a leaf-level PPFD of 100  μmol m
–2 s–1. The 
chamber temperature was maintained at 28/22 °C for day/night with 
an in-built glasshouse temperature-controlled system. The air tem-
perature and relative humidity (RH) at leaf level were monitored 
using Rotronic HC2-S3 (Bassersdorf, Switzerland) sensors placed in 
a shield vented with a 12 V fan. A Licor quantum sensor (LI-190, 
Lincoln, NE, USA) was mounted at the leaf level to monitor inci-
dent PPFD in the unshaded and shaded glasshouse structure. Data 
from these sensors were stored using a Licor data logger (LI-1400). 
Through the experiment, average midday ambient PPFD, T, and 
RH at leaf level were 741  μmol m
–2 s–1, 25 ºC, and 69% in the sun 
treatment. These figures in the shade treatment were 119  μmol m–2 
s–1, 26 °C, and 65% (see Supplementary Fig. S1C). Hence, the shade 
treatment was equivalent to 16% of sunlight measured in the sun 
treatment, averaged over the experimental period (Supplementary 
Fig.  S1). Instantaneous leaf temperature was measured using a 
hand-held, non-contact infrared thermometer (AGRI-THERM 
II™, Chino Hills, CA USA). On average, shaded leaves were 1–2 °C 
cooler than sun leaves (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Locally collected soil was sun dried (Pinto et al., 2014), coarsely 
sieved, and added to 3.5 litre cylindrical pots. Pots were watered to 
100% capacity and transferred to the glasshouse chamber. Seeds for 
grasses used in this study (Table 1) were obtained from the Australian 
Plant Genetic Resources Information System (QLD, Australia) and 
Queensland Agricultural Seeds Pty. Ltd. (Toowoomba, Australia). 
In the current study, we used 2–3 representative species belonging to 
each of the C
4 subtypes. Within each subtype, species were selected 
from different C4 origins (tribes in Table 1) to randomize the C4 ori-
gin effect, and hence focus on the subtype effect.
Seeds were germinated in a commercial Osmocote ® professional, 
seed raising and cutting mix (Scotts, Bella Vista, NSW , Australia). 
Three to four weeks after germination, two healthy seedlings were 
transplanted into each of the soil-filled and pre-irrigated pots. 
A  week later, one healthy seedling was left in each pot while the 
other was removed. Plants were allowed to grow until the 5–6 leaf 
stage in full sunlight before they were transferred to the shade treat-
ment. There were eight pots per species and light treatment. Pots 
were randomly positioned and regularly rotated within each treat-
ment throughout the experiment. Plants were well watered daily with 
added commercial soluble fertilizer (Aquasol, N:P:K=23.3:3.95:14; 
Yates, Wetherill Park, NSW , Australia).
Leaf gas exchange measurements
Leaf gas exchange was measured with a portable open gas exchange 
system (LI-6400XT, LI-COR). The youngest last fully expanded leaf 
(LFEL) on the main stem of a 6- to 9-week-old plant was measured 
at a leaf temperature of 28 °C between 10.00 h and 14.00 h. Shaded 
plants developed a minimum of three new leaves under shade before 
gas exchange measurements were made.
Each leaf was allowed to reach a steady state, at least 20  min, 
CO
2 assimilation rate (A) at ambient [CO 2] of 407  µbar, PPFD of 
2000  μmol m –2 s –1, and RH of 50–70%. After this, a steady-state 
measurement [performed concurrently with tunable diode-laser 
(TDL) analysis; see below for details] was taken. Subsequently, the 
response of A to step increases of intercellular CO
2 (Ci), the A–C i 
curve, was measured by raising the LI-6400XT leaf chamber [CO 2] 
in 10 steps between 50  µbar and 1500  µbar. After completing the 
A–Ci curve at PPFD 2000  μmol m –2 s –1, the leaf was allowed to 
reach a steady state of gas exchange at saturating CO 2 (660  µbar) 
before measuring the responses to PPFD. The light response curve 
was measured from HL to LL (11 steps) followed by measurements 
of dark respiration (R
d) at ambient [CO2] of 407  µbar after 20 min 
in a dark leaf chamber. Prior to LL steady-state measurement (per-
formed concurrently with TDL analysis; see below for details), the 
same leaf was allowed to reach a steady-state A similarly to HL 
measurements, except PPFD was controlled at 250  μmol m
–2 s –1. 
This was followed by measuring the A–C i curve at the same light 
(LL) as described above. There were 3–4 replicates per treatment. 
The initial slope (IS) of the A–C
i curve was estimated for the linear 
part of the A–C i curve measured at HL where C i is <55  µbar. The 
aximum CO2 assimilation rate (A) on the A–Ci curve was considered 
as the CO2-saturated rate (CSR). The A–Ci curves measured at LL 
could not be used for accurate IS determination due to low overall 
rates. The light response curves were fitted using the following equa-
tion (Ögren and Evans, 1993):

where, I=absorbed irradiance, we assumed absorptance=0.85; 
A=CO2 assimilation rate at given light; Φ nls=maximum quantum 
yield of PSII; A max=light-saturated CO 2 assimilation rate; and 
θ=curvature factor of the light response curve. In addition, the slope 
of a linear part of the light response curve (PPFD <120  μmol m
–2 
s–1) was estimated as the ‘apparent’ maximum quantum yield of PSII 
(Фmax). We consider this estimate in our further analysis.
Photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination
Bundle sheath leakiness (ϕ) was determined by measuring real-time 
13CO2/12CO2 isotope discrimination using a LI-6400XT interfaced 
with a tunable diode laser, TDL (TGA100, Campbell Scientific, Inc., 
Logan, UT, USA). The mean SD for repeated TDL measurements 
of δ
13C values for a reference gas was 0.09‰. Observed photosyn-
thetic carbon isotope discrimination against (Δ P) was calculated

(Pengelly et al., 2010, 2012; Ubierna et al., 2013; von Caemmerer 
et al., 2014). The reference gas supplied to the LI-6400XT during gas 
exchange measurements had δ13C= –5.5‰. Therefore, the value for 
the fractionation factor e associated with respiration was calculated 
assuming recent photoassimilates as the respiratory substrate (Stutz 
et al., 2014). Thus, e equalled the difference between δ
13C in the CO2 
sample line in LI-6400XT and that in the glasshouse chamber (–8‰; 
Tazoe et al. (2008)). A and R
d (von Caemmerer et al., 2014) denote 
the CO2 assimilation rate and day respiration, respectively; R d was 
assumed to equal measured dark respiration. We assumed meso-
phyll conductance, g
m=1.4 mol m –2 s–1 at 28 °C (for C 4 the model 
plant Setaria viridis) (Ubierna et al., 2017).
Leakiness at low light (ϕl) was calculated as described by Bellasio 
and Griffiths (2014b) and Ubierna et  al. (2013). Briefly, electron 
transport flux (J t) at low light was derived by deploying the light-
limited C4 photosynthesis model to calculate Cs (CO2 mole fraction 
in the bundle sheath), Vp (PEP carboxylation rate), Vc (Rubisco 
carboxylation rate), and Vo (Rubisco oxygenation rate) at LL using 
the C4 model (von Caemmerer, 2000) (see Supplementary Appendix 
S1). It should be noted that we used measured values for the frac-
tion of PSII in BSCs, α (0 for NADP-ME and 0.2 for PEP-CK 
and NAD-ME) and half of the reciprocal of Rubisco specificity, 
γ* (0.000255, 0.00023, and 0.000233 for NADP-ME, NAD-ME, 
and PEP-CK, respectively) (Table  2; Sharwood et  al., 2016a) for 
biochemical subtypes of C
4 photosynthesis during the calculation 
of Jt. These parameters were then used to calculate b4  (the com-
bined effects of fractionations by the CO 2 dissolution, hydration, 
and PEPC activity at LL) and b3  (Rubisco fractionation at LL by 
accounting for the fraction during respiration and photorespiration) 
(Farquhar, 1983; Ubierna et al., 2013) to calculate ϕ l in the follow-

Activity of Rubisco, PEPC, NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PCK
Following gas exchange measurements, replicate discs (0.4–1  cm 2) 
were rapidly frozen in liquid N then stored at –80 °C until analysed. 
Two sets of extractions were performed to complete the biochem-
ical analysis. For Rubisco activity, activation, and content, PEPC 
and NADP-ME activity, and soluble protein assays, the extraction 
buffer was purged of CO
2 overnight by bubbling a weak jet of nitro-
gen gas through the basic buffer [50  mM EPPS-NaOH (pH 7.8), 
5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA]. Each leaf disc was extracted in 0.8 ml 
of ice-cold extraction buffer [50 mM EPPS-NaOH (pH 7.8), 5 mM 
DTT, 5 mM MgCl
2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μl of protease inhibitor cock-
tail (Sigma), 1% (w/v) polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP)] using a 
2 ml Tenbroeck glass homogenizer kept on ice. Chlorophyll content 
was estimated according to Porra et al. (1989) by mixing 100  µl of 
total extract with 900  µl of acetone. The extract was then centri-
fuged at 15 000 g for 1 min and the supernatant was used for the 
subsequent assays. For Rubisco content, subsamples of the super -
natant were incubated for 10 min in activation buffer [50 mM EPPS 
(pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl
2, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaHCO3]. Rubisco 
content was estimated by the irreversible binding of [ 14C]CABP 
(2-C-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) to the fully carbamylated 
enzyme (Sharwood et al., 2008). Extractable soluble proteins were 
measured using the Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) protein assay 
kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
The activities of the photosynthetic enzymes Rubisco, PEPC, 
and NADP-ME were measured using spectrophotometric assays 
as described previously (Jenkins et  al., 1987; Ashton et  al., 1990; 
Sharwood et al., 2008, 2014, 2016b; Pengelly et al., 2010). Briefly, 
initial Rubisco activity was measured in assay buffer containing 
50 mM EPPS-NaOH (pH 8), 10 mM MgCl
2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
ATP, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 20 mM NaHCO3, 0.2 mM NADH, 50 
U of creatine phosphokinase, 0.2 mg of carbonic anhydrase, 50 U 
of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 40 U of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, 113 U of triose-phosphate isomerase, and 39 U 
Photosynthetic responses of C4 grasses to low light | 3057
of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the reaction initiated 
by the addition of 0.22  mM ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). 
For maximal Rubisco activity, the supernatant was activated in 
assay buffer for 10  min at 25  °C before initiation of the reaction. 
Rubisco activation was calculated as the initial/maximal Rubisco 
activity ratio. Our Rubisco activity from in vitro assays was slightly 
lower than CO
2 assimilation rates. Hence, in the current study, we 
presented Rubisco activity estimated from Rubisco sites measured 
with CABP assay and published Rubisco K
cat for individual species 
(Sharwood et al., 2016a), and Rubisco activation values are from in 
vitro initial and activated Rubisco assays.
PEPC activity was measured in assay buffer [50  mM EPPS-
NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2, 0.2 mM NADH, 
5  mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.2  mM NADH, 1  mM NaHCO 3, 1 
U of malate dehydrogenase (MDH)] after the addition of 4  mM 
PEP . NADP-ME activity was measured in assay buffer [50  mM 
NADP-ME buffer (pH 8.3), 4 mM MgCl
2, 0.5 mM NADP, 0.1 mM 
EDTA] after the addition of 5 mM malic acid.
The activity of PEP-CK was measured in the carboxylation dir -
ection using the method outlined previously (Koteyeva et al., 2015; 
Sharwood et  al., 2016b). For PEP-CK and NAD-ME activity, a 
separate leaf disc was homogenized in extraction buffer containing 
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton, 5 mM DTT, 
1% PVPP, and 2  mM MnCl
2 using a 2  ml Tenbroeck glass hom-
ogenizer kept on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 21 130 g for 
1 min and the supernatant used for PEP-CK and NAD-ME activ-
ity assays. PEP-CK activity was measured in assay buffer contain-
ing 50 mM HEPS (pH 6.3), 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM KCl, 
90 mM KHCO
3, 0.5 mM ADP, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM NADH, 6 U 
of MDH, and 5 mM aspartic acid after the addition of 10 mM PEP . 
NAD-ME activity was measured in 25 mM Tricine (pH 8.3), 5 mM 
DTT, 2 mM NAD, 0.1 mM acetyl-CoA, 4 mM MnCl
2, and 2 mM 
EDTA after the addition of 5 mM malic acid. Enzyme activity was 
calculated by monitoring the decrease/increase of NADH
+ absorb-
ance at 340  nm with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (model 8453, 
Agilent Technologies Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria).

SDS–PAGE and immunoblot analysis of photosynthetic proteins
SDS–PAGE and immunoblot analysis of photosynthetic proteins 
were performed as described in Sharwood et al. (2014). The proce-
dures are described below.
Subsamples of total leaf extracts used for enzyme assays were 
mixed with 0.25 vols of 4× LDS buffer (Invitrogen) contain-
ing 100 mM DTT and placed in liquid nitrogen, then stored at 
–20 °C until they were analysed. For confirmatory visualization, 
protein samples were separated by SDS–PAGE in TGX Any kD 
(BioRad) pre-cast polyacrylamide gels buffered with 1× Tris-
glycine SDS buffer (BioRad) at 200 V using the Mini-Protean 
apparatus at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized by staining with Bio-
Safe Coomassie G-250 (BioRad) and imaged using the VersaDoc 
imaging system (BioRad).
For immunoblot analyses, samples of total leaf proteins were 
separated by SDS–PAGE as outlined above, then transferred at 
4 °C to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 µm; BioRad) using the Xcell 
Surelock western transfer module (Invitrogen) buffered with 1× 
Transfer buffer [20 × 25 mM Bicine, 25 mM Bis-Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 
20% (v/v) methanol]. After 1 h transfer at 30 V , the membrane was 
placed in blocking solution [3% (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-
buffered saline (TBS); 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl] for 
1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation.
Primary antisera raised in rabbit against tobacco Rubisco (pre-
pared by S.M. Whitney) was diluted 1:4000 in TBS before incubation 
for 1 h with membranes at room temperature with gentle agitation. 
Antiserum raised against PEPC (Cat. AS09 458)  was obtained 
from AgriSera and diluted 1:2000 with TBS. For NADP-ME 
and PEP-CK, synthetic peptides based on monocot amino acid 
sequences for each protein were synthesized by GL Biochem and 
antisera were raised against each peptide in rabbits. The reactive 
antiserum was the antigen purified for use in immunoblot analysis 
(GL Biochem). The NADP-ME and PEP-CK antisera were diluted 
in TBS 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively. All primary antisera were 
incubated with membranes at room temperature for 1 h with gen-
tle agitation before washing three times with TBS. Secondary goat 
anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 
Cat. NEF 812001EA, Perkin Elmer) was diluted 1:3000 in TBS and 
incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature followed 
by three washes with TBS. Immunoreactive peptides were detected 
using the Immun-Star Western C kit (Cat. 170-5070, BioRad) and 
imaged using the VersaDoc.
Leaf nitrogen and carbon isotope analyses
Following gas exchange and leaf disc sampling, the remainder 
of the LFEL was cut and its area was measured using a leaf 
area meter (LI-3100A, LI-COR). The LFEL was oven-dried, 
weighed, then milled to a fine powder. Leaf N content was deter -
mined on the ground leaf tissue samples using a CHN analyser 
(LECO TruSpec, LECO Corp., MI, USA). Leaf mass per area 
(LMA, g m
–2) was calculated as total leaf dry mass/total leaf 
area. Leaf N per unit area (N area) was calculated as (mmol N 
g–1)×LMA (g m –2). For leaf δ 13C, ground leaf samples were com-
busted in a Carlo Erba Elemental Analyser (Model 1108)  and 
the released CO
2 was analysed by MS. The δ13C=[(Rsample –Rstanda
rd)/Rstandard ]×1000, where R sample  and R standard  are the 13C/12C ratio 
of the sample and standard (Pee Dee Belemnite), respectively. 
Photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination based on leaf dry 
matter δ
13C (∆ DM) was calculated as described by Farquhar and 
Richards (1984):
 ∆ DM
ap
p
= −
+
δδ
δ1  (11)
where δa and δp are the δ13C values in the glasshouse air (assumed to 
be –8‰) and in the leaf bulk material, respectively.
PWUE and PNUE calculations
Photosynthetic water use efficiency (PWUE) was calculated as A 
(µmol m–2 s–1)/gs (mol m–2 s–1). Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency 
(PNUE) was calculated as A (µmol m–2 s–1)/leaf Narea (mmol m–2).
Plant harvest
Plants were harvested 10–11 weeks after transplanting. At harvest, 
leaves were separated from stems. Total leaf area was determined 
using a Licor LI-3100A leaf area meter. Roots were washed free of 
soil. Plant materials were oven-dried at 80  ºC for 48  h before dry 
mass (DM) was measured. Total plant DM included leaf, stem, and 
root DM. Leaf nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was calculated as the 
ratio of total plant DM (g per plant)/total leaf N content (mg).
Statistical analysis
Growth, gas exchange, enzyme assay, and leaf nitrogen analy-
ses were performed on 3–4 replicates per treatment combination 
(species×light). For species as a main effect, the relationship 
between various response variables and the main effect (species 
and light treatment) and their interactions were fitted using the lin-
ear model in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria) (R Core Team, 2015). Since the numbers of species within 
each subtype were unequal and measurements were taken on mul-
tiple individuals within a species, each unit cannot be considered as 
a true independent replicate. Therefore, a linear mixed effect model 
(lmer) was used to estimate the fixed effect associated with light 
treatment and subtype, where species were treated as a random 
variable. For each response variable, the models containing all pos-
sible fixed effects were fitted using the lme4 package (Bates et al., 
2013) in R. The model residues were tested for normality, and data 
transformation was carried out to achieve a normal distribution, if 
required. Significance tests were performed with a parametric boot-
strap by using the ‘pbkrtest’ package in R (Halekoh and Højsgaard, 
2014). Briefly, a linear mixed effect model (fitted with maximum 
likelihood), full and restricted models, was used as a sample to gen-
erate the likelihood ratio statistic (LRT) after 1000 bootstraps. To 
estimate the P-value, LRT divided by the number of degrees of free-
dom was assumed to be F -distributed where denominator degrees 
of freedom are determined by matching the first moment of refer -
ence distribution.
Results
Throughout this study, the species effect was highly signifi-
cant for all parameters and generally is not described below 
(Table 2).
Plant growth and leaf chemistry
Across treatments, PEP-CK species had a higher average plant 
DM and total leaf area relative to NADP-ME and NAD-ME 
species (P<0.05; Table 2; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1). 
Shade reduced plant DM to a greater extent in NAD-ME 
(–95%) and PEP-CK (–92%) relative to NADP-ME (–81%) 
species (Table  2; Fig.  1A; Supplementary Table  S1). Total 
plant DM and total leaf area were linearly correlated across 
the species and light treatments (R
2=0.9 for the log rela-
tionship) (Fig. 1C). The effect of shading on plant DM and 
leaf area increased linearly with shaded plant DM (R
2=0.97 
and 0.89, respectively). The root to shoot ratio did not vary 
according to subtype but was substantially reduced by shade 
Photosynthetic responses of C4 grasses to low light | 3059
in all species (Table 2; Supplementary Table S1). There was 
no significant subtype effect on LMA, leaf N mass, or leaf 
Narea, while shade reduced LMA and leaf N area (but not leaf 
Nmass) in most species (Table 2; Supplementary Table S1).
Leaf gas exchange at low and high light
Overall, there was no significant subtype effect on CO 2 
assimilation rates and stomatal conductance measured at 
HL (Ah and gsh, respectively) and LL (Al and gsl, respectively) 
(P>0.05, Table 2). However, there was a significant treatment 
and subtype×treatment effect on both A h and A l (P<0.05; 
Table 2). In particular, shade reduced Ah and Al to a greater 
extent in NAD-ME (–62% and –27%, respectively) relative 
to PEP-CK (–46% and –15%, respectively) and NADP-ME 
–40% and 0%, respectively) species (Fig. 1B; Supplementary 
Table  S2). Furthermore, under shade, NADP-ME species 
had the highest and NAD-ME species had the lowest A
h and 
gh, indicating that photosynthesis and stomatal conduct-
ance acclimated to shade more strongly in the latter species 
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2). The CO
2 assimilation rate 
was strongly correlated with stomatal conductance across all 
species and treatments (R
2=0.86) (Fig.  2A). Consequently, 
Ci/Ca was constant and, together with PWUE, did not 
vary according to the subtype or light treatment (Table  2; 
Supplementary Table S2).
R
d did not differ between the subtypes but it was reduced by 
shade in NADP-ME and NAD-ME species (Fig. 1D; Table 2; 
Supplementary Table S2). For control plants, the R d/A ratio 
(measured at growth light) was lowest in PEP-CK species; 
shade increased R
d/A less in NADP-ME (+158%) relative to 
PEP-CK (+374%) and NAD-ME (+341%) species (Table 2; 
Supplementary Table  S2). CO
2 assimilation rate measured 
at HL, A h, and R d showed good linear relationships to leaf 
Narea across species (R 2=0.59 and R 2=0.54, respectively). 
PNUE was marginally lower (P=0.1) in NAD-ME relative to 
NADP-ME and PEP-CK species, and was reduced by shade 
mostly in NAD-ME (–28%) and PEP-CK (–19%) (Table 2; 
Supplementary Table  S2). Leaf NUE was reduced to a 
greater extent in NADP-ME and NAD-ME species (–41% 
and –39%, respectively) relative to PEP-CK species (Table 2; 
Supplementary Table S1).

Photosynthetic CO2 response curves
The initial slopes (ISs) of the A–C i curvesand CO2-saturated 
rates (CSRs) were estimated from measurements at HL 
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In control plants, the IS and CSR 
did not vary with subtypes, but were reduced by shade to a 
greater extent in NAD-ME (–77% for IS and –64% for CSR) 
than PEP-CK (–49% for IS and CSR) and NADP-ME species 
(–46% for IS and –39% for CSR) (Tables 2, 3). Consequently, 
CSR of shaded plants was lowest in NAD-ME, intermediate 
in PEP-CK, and highest in NADP-ME species (Tables 2, 3). 
There was a strong linear relationship between IS and CSR 
irrespective of treatment and subtype (R
2=0.73) (Fig. 2B).
Photosynthetic light response curves
The light-saturated photosynthesis rate, A max, and photo-
synthetic quantum yield, Фmax, were estimated from the light 
Fig. 2. Relationships among physiological and in vivo derived parameters. CO2 assimilation (Ah), stomatal conductance (gh), IS, and CSR derived from 
A–Ci curves measured at high light, Amax and Φmax derived from light response curves measured at saturating [CO2], and leaf Narea for eight C4 grasses 
belonging to three biochemical subtypes grown in control (full sunlight; blue) or shade (16% of natural sunlight) (red) environments. Straight lines are linear 
regressions for all data points.

response curves of photosynthesis measured at saturating 
CO2 (Supplementary Fig.  S3). In control plants, A max and 
Фmax did not vary with subtypes (Tables 2, 3; Fig. 3G). Shade 
reduced Amax and Фmax to a greater extent in NAD-ME spe-
cies (–68% and –55%, respectively) than PEP-CK (–54% 
and –32%, respectively) and NADP-ME (–39% and –19%, 
respectively) species (Tables  2, 3). Consequently, Ф
max was 
lower in shaded NAD-ME species relative to their NADP-ME 
and PEP-CK counterparts (P<0.05), which indicates dif-
ferential shade acclimation of photosynthetic capacity and 
quantum efficiency among the C
4 subtypes. In control plants, 
the curvature (θ) was highest in NADP-ME (0.81) and lowest

each subtype are shown: *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.
3062 | Sonawane et al
in NAD-ME species (0.53) (P<0.05) (Tables 2, 3). When all 
data were considered, Amax was well correlated with Фmax, IS, 
CSR, and leaf Narea (Fig. 2C–F).
Carbon isotope discrimination
Concurrent measurements of 13CO2/12CO2 discrimination 
and leaf gas exchange showed that photosynthetic carbon 
isotope discrimination, ∆ P, was independent of the C 4 sub-
type at HL (Table 2). ∆ P tended to be lower in NADP-ME 
species relative to the other two subtypes, but differences 
were not significant, except when compared with the control 
plants measured at HL (Table  2; Supplementary Table  S3). 
For NADP-ME species, ∆
P was unchanged by either LL or 
shade, while ∆ P increased in PEP-CK and NAD-ME spe-
cies in response to both LL and shade (22–37%) (Fig.  3A; 
Supplementary Table S3).
Leakiness (ϕ) ranged between 0.15 and 0.35 across the C
4 
grasses and light treatments (Fig. 3B , C). For shaded plants 
measured at HL, NAD-ME species had higher leakiness (0.29) 
than NADP-ME species (0.14) (Supplemetary Table  S3). 
Overall, NAD-ME species exhibited increased ϕ  at LL and 
in the shade environment (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table S3).
Photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination derived 
from bulk leaf δ
13C values, ∆ DM, was significantly lower in 
NADP-ME species relative to the other two subtypes (P<0.05) 
(Table  2; Supplementary Table  S3). Shade increased ∆
DM 
in NAD-ME and PEP-CK species only (+30% and +22%, 
respectively) (Fig. 3E; Table 2; Supplementary Table S3).
There was a strong linear relationship between photosyn-
thetic discrimination measured at growth light, ∆
growth, and 
∆DM (R2=0.56) (Fig. 3F). This relationship had an x-intercept 
of 0.9‰, which reflects the difference between ∆ growth and 
∆DM due to time-integrated changes in ambient 13CO2/12CO2 
and post-photosynthetic fractionation. The good fit between 
∆
growth and ∆ DM suggests that leaf δ 13C is a good predictor 
of ∆ growth, and perhaps C i/Ca (PWUE) for C 4 grasses when 
changes are caused by a difference in light intensity. In add-
ition, there was a significant, negative linear relationships 
between Ф
max and ∆growth (R2=0.35) (Fig 3D).
Activity of photosynthetic enzymes
Control NAD-ME plants had the highest leaf content of 
Rubisco sites (P <0.05) (Fig.  4A; Table  2: Supplemetnary 
Table  S4). Rubisco activation decreased significantly in 
NAD-ME (–40%) and PEP-CK (–22%) species, while it 
increased by ~15% in NADP-ME species (subtype×light 
P=0.07) (Fig.  4A, B; Table  2; Supplementary Table  S4). 
Consequently, initial Rubisco activity did not differ according 
to the C
4 subtype (P>0.05), and was reduced to a greater extent 
in NAD-ME relative to the PEP-CK and NADP-ME species 
under shade in all C
4 grasses (subtype×treatment P<0.08) 
(Fig.  4C; Table  2; Supplementary Table  S4). Soluble protein 
content decreased under shade by 12–67% depending on the 
species but not the subtype (Table 2; Supplementary Table S4).
In general, shade reduced PEPC activity by 49–84% in the 
C
4 grasses. PEPC activity was higher in control NADP-ME 
plants and decreased to a lesser extent in NAD-ME (66%) 
than in NADP-ME (69%) and PEP-CK (65%) species 
(Fig.  4D; Table  2; Supplementary Table  S4). Consequently, 
shade reduced the ratio of PEPC to initial Rubisco activity in 
NADP-ME (–44%) but not in PEP-CK (–3%) species, while 
this ratio tended to increase in NAD-ME species (+30%) 
(Fig. 4E; Supplementary Table S4,).
There was a significant relationship between the PEPC/ini-
tial Rubisco activity ratio and ∆
DM (P<0.05), and this rela-
tionship was stronger in shade (R 2=0.49) than in control 
(R2=0.40) plants. In contrast, PEPC/initial Rubisco activity 
showed a weaker relationship to ∆growth (R2=0.23) irrespective 
of treatment and subtype.
Activities of NADP-ME, PEP-CK, and NAD-ME enzymes 
were dominant in their respective subtype; however, substan-
tial PEP-CK activity (6–25  µmol m
–2 s –1) was measured in 
NADP-ME and NAD-ME species (Supplementary Table S4). 
Shade reduced the activity of NADP-ME, PEP-CK, and 
NAD-ME by 35–60, 52–64, and 49–57%, respectively 
(P<0.05). Shade also reduced the activity of total decar -
boxylases by 25–64% (P <0.05); the reduction was lower in 
NADP-ME (42%) relative to PEP-CK (60%) and NAD-ME 
(65%) species (Fig. 4F; Table 2; Supplementary Table S4).
The detectability of enzyme activity was corroborated by 
immunodetection of the corresponding protein for all the 
photosynthetic enzymes assayed, except for NAD-ME where 
a suitable antibody was not available during this study (Fig. 5). 
Rubisco and PEPC proteins were detected in all species and 
treatments. Surprisingly, NADP-ME protein was detected in 
all C
4 species, including NAD-ME and PEP-CK. This may 
be attributed to cross-reaction with a non-photosynthetic iso-
mer of NADP-ME or NAD-ME proteins (Fig. 5). PEP-CK 
protein was strongly detectable in Panicum maximum and to 
a lesser extent in Chloris gayana, although C. gayana had the 
highest PEP-CK activity (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S4). In 
addition, PEP-CK protein was detected in three NADP-ME 
species, but not in Sorghum bicolor, reflecting well the trends 
in PEP-CK activity (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S4).
Discussion
C4 photosynthesis is thought to be less plastic in response to 
shade than C 3 photosynthesis due to its complex anatomy 
and biochemistry (Sage and McKown, 2006). Y et, some stud-
ies found similar photosynthetic responses to LL in C
3 and C4 
plants (Tazoe et al., 2006, 2008; Pengelly et al., 2010). These 
studies have focused on the response of selected C4 species to 
short-term changes in irradiance (Tazoe et al., 2008; Pengelly 
et al., 2010; Ubierna et al., 2013; Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014a, 
b) or long-term adaptation to growth under LL (Kromdijk 
et al., 2008, 2010; Tazoe et al., 2008; Bellasio and Griffiths, 
2014b). However, there is limited information about how LL 
responses differ across the C
4 subtypes. Here, we present the 
first study comparing the short- and long-term responses to 
LL of C 4 grasses with different biochemical subtypes. We 
hypothesized that (i) LL (short and long term) will comprom-

between 4 μl and 15 μl in order to normalize the protein content to a common leaf area. Because of the small gel size, a limited number of samples (8–9) 
was loaded on an individual gel. Finally, all immunoblots of the studied protein and species were arranged in a composite figure. For uniform visualization, 
gamma settings of individual images were adjusted. A protein ladder was used for individual immunoblots; for simplicity, band size is referred to

in PEP-CK or NADP-ME grasses due to a greater increase in 
leakiness (ϕ) in the former subtype; and (ii) shade will cause a 
greater photosynthetic acclimation in NAD-ME grasses than 
in NADP-ME and PEP-CK counterparts by virtue of their 
higher leaf N and Rubisco content. To evaluate these hypoth-
eses, we grew eight C
4 grasses belonging to three biochem-
ical subtypes (NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PEP-CK) under 
shade (16% sunlight) or control (full sunlight) conditions, and 
subsequently measured their photosynthetic characteristics 
under both LL and HL. Our results supported both hypoth-
eses and demonstrated that LL compromised the CCM effi-
ciency and photosynthetic quantum yield to a greater extent 
in NAD-ME relative to PEP-CK and NADP-ME species.
Low light compromised the CCM efficiency most in 
NAD-ME followed by PEP-CK, but not in NADP-ME 
grasses
For the operational CCM, the C4 cycle must be faster than the 
C3 cycle (i.e. PEPC/initial Rubisco activity ratio >1) to concen-
trate CO2 inside the BSCs, some of which will inevitably leak 
back out to the MCs. In the short term, LL may comprom-
ise CCM efficiency by affecting the activity of the C 3 cycle 
(e.g. Rubisco) more significantly than that of the C4 cycle (e.g. 
PEPC) and, hence, increasing ∆P, ϕ, and Фmax. Under LL, A is 
low and CO2 evolved during respiration can make an important 
contribution to the total CO2 concentration inside the BSCs. 
Larger Rd/A ratios under LL can potentially lead to higher ∆P. 
Increased ∆P due to respiratory CO2 does not involve an energy 
cost for the CCM but may lead to an overestimation of ϕ inde-
pendently of Фmax. Long-term acclimation to LL may act to 
optimize CCM efficiency by reversing the negative short-term 
effects of LL (Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014a ). Hence, we used 
the metrics PEPC/initial Rubisco activity, R
d/A, ϕ, and Фmax to 
evaluate the effects of LL during measurements and growth on 
the CCM efficiency of the various C
4 subtypes. Consequently, 
increased ϕ, PEPC/initial Rubisco activity, and R d/A can be 
interpreted as a less efficient photosynthetic process. Assuming 
that bundle sheath conductance does not change with irradi-
ance, increased ∆
P and ϕ can be interpreted as a less efficient 
CCM and an indication of imbalance between the C3 and C4 
cycles (von Caemmerer, 2000).
Response of NADP-ME grasses to LL
In the NADP-ME grasses, ∆ P, ∆DM, and ϕ were not signifi-
cantly impacted by LL during either measurement or growth 
(Fig.  3A, C, E), suggesting that in this subtype, the co-ordi-
nation between the C
3 and C 4 cycles was largely maintained 
despite changes in the light environment. Our results are in 
agreement with previous reports that ∆
P was insensitive to LL 
during the measurements for NADP-ME species (Henderson 
et al., 1992; Kubásek et al., 2007; Cousins et al., 2008) as well as 
∆
DM being insensitive to growth under shade in NADP-ME Zea 
mays (Sharwood et al., 2014). NADP-ME species grown under 
shade had lower PEPC/initial Rubisco activity (–44%) and 
higher R
d/A (+158% at growth light) than the control plants. 
Decreased PEPC/initial Rubisco activity is expected to reduce 
∆
P, ∆DM, and ϕ , while increased R d/A will have the opposite 
effect under shade. The combined opposing effects may explain 
the insensitivity of ∆
P, ∆DM, and ϕ  in response to the shade 
environment. In line with this conclusion, NADP-ME species 
showed the lowest reduction in Ф
max (–19%), and it is likely 
that the contribution from photorespiration was negligible in 
the low-O
2-evolving BSC chloroplasts of NADP-ME species 
(Ghannoum et al., 2005). Previous work describing the shade 
acclimation of the NADP-ME of Z. mays suggested that this 
species reduced the ATP cost of the CCM under shade by 
reducing the PEPC activity more than the C
3 cycle activity, 
which resulted in low ϕ values (Bellasio and Griffiths, 2014a). 
Our findings support this argument by providing direct meas-
urements of in vitro C
4 and C3 cycle enzymes as well as Фmax. 
This argument is also supported by the modelling approach 
of Wang et al. (2014) who suggested that the NADP-ME bio-
chemical pathway is favoured at LL. In contrast to our results, 
differential responses of C
4 and C3 cycle enzymes were reported 
in earlier studies with NADP-ME species (Sugiyama et  al., 
1984; Ward and Woolhouse, 1986a; Sharwood et  al., 2014). 
This discrepancy may be related to differences in the intensity 
of the shade treatment used. In addition, these studies consid-
ered total (rather than initial) Rubisco activity for calculating 
the PEPC/Rubisco activity ratio.
It is worth noting that, in addition to NADP-ME decarb-
oxylase activity, Z.  mays and Cenchrus ciliaris showed sig-
nificant activity of PEP-CK decarboxylase (16–25  µmol m
–2 
s–1), while S. bicolor and Panicum antidotale appeared as true 
NADP-ME types. Without considering cytosolic resistance 
of BSCs to CO
2, Wang et al. (2014) suggested the possibil-
ity of higher leakiness in the C 4 photosynthesis model with 
mixed decarboxylase pathways. This was not validated in 
our study. Bellasio and Griffiths (2014c) also suggested that 
the engagement of the secondary PEP-CK pathway in an 
NADP-ME species enables the CCM to regulate an opti-
mal BSC [CO
2] under changing light conditions. These pre-
dictions were indirectly validated in our study. Under LL, 
Z. mays showed higher ∆
P and ϕ but similar Фmax relative to 
the other two NADP-ME species, P . antidotale and S. bicolor 
(Supplementary Table  S4). However, the link between ∆
P, 
CCM efficiency, and PEP-CK activity as a secondary decarb-
oxylase in NADP-ME species requires further investigation.
Response of PEP-CK and NAD-ME grasses to LL
PEP-CK and NAD-ME plants had larger ∆ DM under shade 
relative to the control condition (Fig. 3E). Previous studies 
have shown similar ∆
DM responses to shade across the C4 sub-
types (Buchmann et al., 1996; Tazoe et al., 2006). In PEP-CK 
and NAD-ME grasses, instantaneous measurements of ∆ P 
and ϕ increased at LL, and the difference between the light 
treatments was highly significant when the comparison was 
made between control and shade plants measured under 
their respective growth irradiance (Fig. 3A, C). These results 
indicate that LL resulted in a less efficient CCM in PEP-CK 
and NAD-ME grasses. Additionally, the relative increase in 
ϕ from HL to LL was larger for control (+60%) than shade 
(+12%) plants. This is in line with Tazoe et  al. (2008) and 
suggests that a degree of acclimation to the shade condition 
mitigated the negative effects of LL observed in response to 
Photosynthetic responses of C4 grasses to low light | 3065
short-term light changes during measurements. Our results 
with PEP-CK and NAD-ME grasses are in agreement with 
previous reports of increased ∆
P and ϕ with short-term 
exposure to LL (Henderson et al., 1992; Cousins et al., 2008).
In NAD-ME species, shade increased the PEPC/initial 
Rubisco activity (+30%) and R d/A (+341% at growth light) 
and decreased Ф max (–55%). Species of the NAD-ME sub-
type possess significant PSII activity in the BSC (Ghannoum 
et al., 2005), and hence potentially high [O
2]. PEP-CK spe-
cies exhibited intermediate responses to shade relative to 
the other two subtypes. In PEP-CK species, the PEPC/ini-
tial Rubisco activity ratio was not affected by shade, but the 
R
d/A ratio was larger (+374%) in shade than in control plants 
(Supplementary Table  S2). Further, the reduction of Ф max 
under shade was intermediate in PEP-CK species (–32%) rela-
tive to NADP-ME (–19%) and NAD-ME (–55%). We also 
have evidence that PEP-CK species possess significant PSII 
activity in BSCs (Pinto, 2015). Accordingly, ∆
P, ∆DM, and ϕ 
increased under shade in PEP-CK species to a similar extent 
relative to NAD-ME counterparts (Fig. 3A, C, E). Thus, in 
line with the first hypothesis, our results demonstrated that 
LL compromised the CCM efficiency of NAD-ME species 
more than that of PEP-CK species, while CCM efficiency was 
largely maintained in NADP-ME species under LL.
Shade induced larger photosynthetic down-regulation 
in NAD-ME relative to NADP-ME and PEP-CK species
In the current study, shade down-regulated Ah and light-satu-
rated photosynthesis, Amax, in NAD-ME (–68%) to a greater 
extent than in PEP-CK (–54%) and NADP-ME (–39%) spe-
cies, indicating stronger photosynthetic acclimation to shade 
in the former subtype (Table 3). Shade equally reduced PEPC 
activity in all the C
4 subtypes (–68%), while Rubisco sites 
and activation were more profoundly reduced in NAD-ME 
(–60% and –40%, respectively) relative to the PEP-CK (–48% 
and –22%, respectively) and NADP-ME (–47% and +15%, 
respectively) species (Supplementary Table S4). Similar large 
reductions in Rubisco content and activity (>55%) were 
reported in studies using C
3 species (Evans, 1988). In shade-
grown C4 species, inconsistent changes in Rubisco content 
and activity have been observed (Winter et  al., 1982; Ward 
and Woolhouse, 1986a, b; Tazoe et al., 2006), with an average 
reduction of 29% (Sage and McKown, 2006). A relevant study 
by Ward and Woolhouse (1986a) subjecting C
4-NADP-ME 
grasses to deep shade reported a greater reduction in Rubisco 
activity in species from the open habitat (34%) relative to the 
shade habitat (3%). Likewise, NAD-ME species generally ori-
ginate from relatively more open habitats than NADP-ME 
and PEP-CK species (Vogel et  al., 1986; Hattersley, 1992; 
Schulze et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2012). In addition, similar to 
the C
3 species, NAD-ME grasses may have a greater N flexi-
bility by having higher leaf N relative to NADP-ME and 
PEP-CK counterparts.
Reduced Rubisco content is a common photosynthetic 
acclimation response to shade allowing optimal nitrogen 
allocation for maximal light harvesting (Boardman, 1977; 
Hikosaka and Terashima, 1995; Evans and Poorter, 2001; 
Walters, 2005). Consequently, lower Rubisco activity and 
activation may indicate a shift in photosynthetic limita-
tion from Rubisco (sun leaves) to electron transport (shade 
leaves) (Evans, 1988; Evans and Poorter, 2001). Under shade, 
NAD-ME species had lower Ф
max relative to NADP-ME 
and PEP-CK counterparts (Fig.  3). This difference may be

attributed to a greater inefficiency of the NAD-ME CCM, 
especially under shade as argued above. It could also be 
attributed to inherent inefficiencies of the light conversion 
apparatus in the NAD-ME subtype due to the burden of 
operating two fully fledged linear electron transport systems 
with granal chloroplasts in both MCs and BSCs. This is not 
the case for the NADP-ME subtype, and somewhat interme-
diate for the PEP-CK subtype (Ghannoum et al., 2005, 2011). 
Taken together, these findings support our second hypothesis 
stating that larger photosynthetic reduction and acclimation 
in NAD-ME species is associated with their lower Rubisco 
activation and lower quantum efficiency relative to PEP-CK 
and NADP-ME species.
Whole-plant implications of differential shade 
acclimation among the C4 subtypes
In the current study, CO 2 assimilation at growth light was 
equally reduced in NAD-ME (–81%), PEP-CK (–79%), and 
NADP-ME (–76%) species. However, total leaf area and 
plant DM were more profoundly reduced in NAD-ME (–92% 
and –95%, respectively) than in PEP-CK (–81% and –98%, 
respectively) and NADP-ME (–73% and –81%, respectively) 
species. In addition to reduced leaf area, the larger reduction 
in plant DM for NAD-ME and PEP-CK species could also 
be attributed to reduced CCM efficiency and Ф
max. Further, 
the Rd/A ratio increased to a greater extent in NAD-ME and 
PEP-CK (~3.5-fold) than in NADP-ME species (1.6-fold) 
under shade, which may result in a greater C loss in these two 
subtypes. Taken together, these findings suggest that shade 
may favour NADP-ME species due to their efficient CCM 
and quantum yield, and lower photosynthetic down-regu-
lation and lower increase in R
d/A relative to NAD-ME and 
PEP-CK species.
This conclusion is supported by ecological observations. 
NAD-ME species are preferentially found in open and arid 
habitats relative to the other two C
4 subtypes (Osmond et al., 
1982; Vogel et al., 1986; Hattersley, 1992; Schulze et al., 1996; 
Liu et al., 2012). On the one hand, most of the understorey 
C4 grasses belong to the NADP-ME subtypes, such as Setaria 
species (Schulze et  al., 1996), Paspalum species (Ward and 
Woolhouse, 1986b; Klink and Joly, 1989; Firth et al., 2002), 
and Microstegium vimineum (Barden, 1987). Moreover, 
NADP-ME species form dense canopy crops such as maize, 
Sorghum, Miscanthus, and sugarcane where most leaves are 
shaded (Sage, 2014).
It should be noted that a different light spectrum affects 
CCM efficiency in C
4 photosynthesis (Sun et al., 2012). The 
light spectrum may vary in natural shade settings due to 
growth season, canopy compositions, and architecture (Ross 
et  al., 1986; Messier et  al., 1998). Therefore, an interaction 
effect between subtype and light spectral composition cannot 
be ignored, and further investigations are warranted.
Conclusion
Using C4 grass from three biochemical subtypes and grown 
under full sunlight and shade (16% of full sunlight) conditions 
equivalent to the light environment prevailing in lower crop 
canopies or forest understorey, this study demonstrated that 
NAD-ME and to a lesser extent PEP-CK species were gener-
ally outperformed by NADP-ME species under shade. This 
response was underpinned by a more efficient CCM and 
quantum yield in NADP-ME. These findings were corrobo-
rated by in vivo and in vitro measurements of C
3 and C4 cycle 
enzymes, maximum quantum yield of PSII (Ф max), photo-
synthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Δ P), leaf dry mat-
ter δ13C, and total plant dry mass. Future research is needed 
to quantify the impact of respiration and photorespiration 
on carbon isotope discrimination (∆
P) in the three biochem-
ical subtypes of C4 photosynthesis, as well as the significance 
of the secondary PEP-CK decarboxylase on photosynthetic 
responses to shade.
