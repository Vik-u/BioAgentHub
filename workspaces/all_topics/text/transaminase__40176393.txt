ABSTRACT
Background: Elevated liver biochemistries are associated with increased risk of negative outcomes in patients with primary 
biliary cholangitis (PBC).
Aims: To evaluate whether longitudinal monitoring of liver biochemistries and fibrosis scores provides additional prognostic 
value and to assess the relationship between the degree of elevation of multiple biomarkers within different alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) strata.
Methods: Adults with PBC were identified from Komodo's Healthcare Map. A Cox proportional hazards model examined time 
to first occurrence of hospitalisation due to hepatic decompensation, liver transplantation, or death as a function of the propor -
tion of time during follow- up that liver biochemistries and fibrosis scores exceeded thresholds. Within ALP strata (ALP ≤ upper 
limit of normal [ULN]; ALP>ULN to ≤ 1.67 × ULN; ALP > 1.67 × ULN), separate multivariate Cox hazard models assessed the 
association between time-  varying covariates and the composite endpoint.
Results: Overall, 3974 patients were included; 88.2% were female, with a mean age of 59.4 years. The median follow- up was 
2.5 years. Increasing magnitude and duration beyond established thresholds of ALP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspar -
tate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), AST/platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-  4 (FIB-  4) were associated with 
increased risk of negative outcomes. Elevated ALT, AST, TB, APRI and FIB-  4 were associated with increased risk of negative 
outcomes across all ALP strata.
Conclusions: Prolonged elevation of multiple hepatic biomarkers and fibrosis scores is associated with a greater risk of negative 
clinical outcomes, underscoring the importance of ongoing monitoring beyond the guideline-  recommended initial treatment 
response to guide timely treatment decisions and improve PBC management.

1   |   Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare progressive autoim -
mune liver disease characterised by chronic inflammation and 
progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts [ 1, 2]. If left 
untreated, PBC may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and/or 
death [3, 4]. PBC disproportionally affects women, with an es -
timated US female: male ratio of 4:1, and is typically diagnosed 
between age 40 and 60 years [ 2, 5 ]. The 2021 adjusted preva -
lence of PBC in the US was reported to be 40.9 per 100,000 
adult population [ 6], slightly higher than the 39.2 per 100,000 
reported by the Fibrotic Liver Disease Consortium in 2014 [ 7].
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first-  line pharmacother -
apy for PBC and has been shown to slow disease progression, 
improve liver function, and enhance survival [ 8–10]; however, 
approximately 40% of patients with PBC may have an inadequate 
response to treatment with UDCA, and 3% to 5% are intolerant 
to it [ 11]. The biochemical response to UDCA is a robust pre -
dictor of long- term outcomes used to identify patients who may 
benefit from second-  line therapy [ 11]. Obeticholic acid (OCA), 
the only farnesoid X receptor agonist approved for the second-  
line treatment of PBC, has been commercially available under 
accelerated approval since 2016 for patients who either have an 
inadequate response to UDCA or are unable to tolerate it [8–10]. 
In 2024, two peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor agonists, 
elafibranor and seladelpar, became available under accelerated 
approval as additional second- line treatment options [12–15].
Current guidelines recommend evaluating the biochemical 
response (e.g., changes in serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT], and total bilirubin [TB] levels) to UDCA after 1 year 
of treatment using established criteria and risk scores (e.g., 
GLOBE [ 16], Paris I [ 17] and II [ 18], Barcelona [ 19], Toronto 
[20], and Rotterdam [ 21] criteria). In patients with more ad -
vanced fibrosis, compensated liver disease, and no signs of 
portal hypertension, assessments may be performed after 
6 months of UDCA treatment (e.g., Chronic Liver Disease 
Foundation criteria) [ 22]. Most criteria use a reduction of ALP 
levels to 1.4 to 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) as the primary 
marker of response [ 8–10].
While ALP is a valuable and informative indicator of treat -
ment response, it alone may not fully capture the risk for 
negative clinical outcomes, as other hepatic biomarkers are 
also associated with the risk of hepatic decompensation, 
liver transplantation, and/or death [ 23]. For example, recent 
data showed higher rates of liver transplantation or death 
even when ALP and TB levels were maintained below cur -
rent guideline-  recommended thresholds [ 1]. The same study 
found that patients with ALP ≤  1 × ULN had better survival 
rates than those with ALP above ULN but < 1.67 × ULN [ 1]. 
Emerging evidence suggests that other biochemical parame -
ters in addition to ALP and TB (e.g., ALT) may be associated 
with the risk for liver transplantation or death in patients with 
PBC [23, 24].
Although fibrosis progression is a hallmark of PBC, established 
criteria for determining UDCA treatment response do not con -
sider fibrosis scores [ 25, 26]. While some nascent studies have 
begun to explore the predictive ability of fibrosis scores in PBC 
[27, 28], a comprehensive analysis of various hepatic biomarkers 
and fibrosis scores may provide additional prognostic value in 
fully characterising the risk of negative clinical outcomes in pa -
tients with PBC [26].
This study investigated whether repeated measurements of 
biochemical markers offer additional value, particularly in 
assessing whether the inclusion of ALT and AST, as well as 
serum-  based fibrosis scores, such as the AST/platelet ratio 
index (APRI) and fibrosis-  4 (FIB-  4) alongside ALP and TB, 
provide further insight into the risk profile of patients with 
PBC. These assessments were conducted within different ALP 
strata to further understand their relevance across varying 
levels of ALP.
2   |   Methods
2.1   |   Data Source
This retrospective cohort study was conducted using Komodo's 
Healthcare Map, which is derived primarily from claims data. 
The database included de-  identified longitudinal administra -
tive medical and pharmacy claims data merged with national 
laboratory data linked via Datavant tokenisation methodol -
ogy [29].
2.2   |   Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Patients diagnosed with PBC (at least one hospitalisation 
claim or at least two outpatient claims on separate days; 
International Classification of Disease (ICD)-  9 code 571.6 
or ICD-  10 code K74.3) between July 1, 2014, and February 
28, 2022, were included in this study. The date of the first 
PBC diagnosis claim was defined as the index date. Patients 
were required to be ≥  18 years of age at the index date, with 
≥ 6 months' continuous enrolment in a health plan with med -
ical and pharmacy coverage before index, including the index 
date (baseline period). Patients were also required to have 
ALP, AST, ALT and TB laboratory data during the 6-  month 
baseline period and at least one of these liver biomarker values 
during the follow- up period (post-  index).
In order to avoid confounding, patients with any of the following 
conditions were excluded from the study: concomitant liver dis -
eases (e.g., hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection, primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, alcohol- associated liver disease, Gilbert syndrome, 
hepatocellular carcinoma), HIV infection, Paget disease, he -
patic decompensation, abnormally high ALP (> 2000 U/L), ALT 
(> 1000 U/L), AST (> 1000 U/L), or abnormally low platelet count 
(< 100,000/mL). Additionally, patients with a record of any decom-
pensating events (variceal bleeding, ascites, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepa-
topulmonary syndrome or hepatic hydrothorax), those who had 
undergone gastric bypass procedures excluding gastric lap band 
and those who had an ileal resection during baseline were also ex-
cluded. Patients with a history or evidence of liver transplantation 
during the pre- index period and those with a record of second- line 
OCA or fibrates on or before the index date were also excluded.
1777
2.3   |   Time- Dependent Exposure Variable
As the hepatic biomarkers may vary over time in the available 
follow- up period, this analysis examined the proportion of time 
that biomarkers and fibrosis scores exceeded normal limits or 
specific thresholds as a time-  dependent covariate. The analysis 
used fixed thresholds for hepatic biomarkers based on standard 
UDCA treatment response criteria (i.e., Paris I, Paris II  and 
Rotterdam) [17, 18, 21] and those described by Ritter et al. [ 30] 
(ALP ULN, 120 U/L; ALT ULN, 40 U/L; AST ULN, 35 U/L for 
males, 30 U/L for females; TB ULN, 1 mg/dL). The thresholds for 
APRI (ULN, 0.5) and FIB-  4 were chosen based on increased risk 
of adverse outcomes observed by Chou et al. and Sterling et al., 
respectively [31, 32].
2.4   |   Outcome Variables
The composite endpoint was defined as the first occurrence of hos-
pitalisation for a decompensating event (variceal bleeding, ascites, 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepato-
renal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatic hydrotho-
rax or hepatic failure), liver transplantation or death (all-  cause). 
Patients were censored at the initiation of second- line treatment, 
end of enrolment or end of follow- up, whichever occurred first.
2.5   |   Statistical Analyses
Baseline patient characteristics were summarised using descrip-
tive statistics. A Cox proportional hazard risk model was used 
to examine the time to the first occurrence of hospitalisation 
due to hepatic decompensation, liver transplantation, or death. 
The fixed effects of age, sex, metabolic dysfunction-  associated 
steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, portal hypertension and 
autoimmune hepatitis, among other baseline patient charac -
teristics, were accounted for, and the time-  varying covariates 
included ALT, AST, FIB-  4 and APRI expressed categorically. 
This analysis accounts for the effect of both the magnitude and 
duration of elevated biomarker levels on negative clinical out -
comes. Exposure for each hepatic biomarker and fibrosis score 
was quantified as the cumulative proportion of time beyond its 
clinical threshold [ 30]. Hazard ratios were calculated over a 5- 
year follow- up period. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted: 
(i) one included only individuals with a PBC diagnosis based 
on ICD- 10 codes and (ii) another excluded patients with MASH 
and/or cirrhosis at index.
As levels of TB > 0.6 × ULN are associated with increased risk 
of liver transplantation and death in patients with PBC [ 1], we 
performed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model of the 
cumulative proportion of follow- up time that ALP and TB were 
beyond thresholds for ALP ≥ ULN and TB > 0.6 × ULN.
Within the specified ALP stratum (ALP ≤ ULN; ALP>ULN to 
≤ 1.67 × ULN; ALP > 1.67 × ULN), a multivariate Cox propor -
tional hazards model assessed the association between a time- 
varying covariate and the composite endpoint. A separate model 
was run for each biomarker and fibrosis score within each ALP 
stratum.
2.6   |   Ethics Statement
This study utilised retrospective de-  identified data and was con-
sidered to be of minimal or no risk to subjects.
3   |   Results
3.1   |   Patient Characteristics
Of the 113,446 adult patients with PBC in the Komodo Health 
Database, 3974 met all eligibility criteria for this study and were 
included in subsequent analyses (Figure  1). Baseline patient 
characteristics were consistent with the known epidemiology of 
PBC (Table 1) [30, 33, 34]. Overall, eligible patients were predom-
inantly female (88.2%) and White (49.4%). One-  fifth of patients 
identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (24.3%). The mean 
(standard deviation) age of eligible patients was 59.4 (12.6) years.
At baseline, slightly less than half of the patients had commer -
cial insurance (43.0%), while 24.2% had Medicare and 13.4% had 
Medicaid coverage. Approximately half of all patients (49.9%) 
were being treated with UDCA, 8.5% had cirrhosis, 6.9% had 
MASH and 5.5% had portal hypertension at baseline (Table  1). 
The overall median follow- up time was 2.5 years (interquartile 
range [IQR], 1.3–4.2), during which 75.0% of patients received 
UDCA (Table  S1). During the follow- up period, most patients 
were censored due to end of enrolment (43.1%) or end of study 
(45.3%).
Patients were stratified into three ALP strata: ALP ≤ ULN 
(n = 1443), ALP>ULN to ≤ 1.67 × ULN (n = 1279), and ALP 
> 1.67 × ULN (n = 1252). The median (IQR) follow- up time was 
2.8 (1.5–4.7), 2.4 (1.3–4.1) and 2.3 (1.1–3.8) years for the ALP 
≤ ULN, ALP>ULN to ≤ 1.67 × ULN and ALP > 1.67 × ULN 
groups, respectively. Hepatic decompensation occurred in 3.4% 
of patients overall, and a greater proportion of patients with ALP 
> 1.67 × ULN experienced hepatic decompensation during the 
follow- up period than those with ALP ≤ 1.67 × ULN (4.9% vs. 
2.7%). Laboratory values out of the normal range are presented 
in Table S2.
3.2   |   Risk of Negative Clinical Outcomes
Increasing magnitude and duration beyond established thresh -
olds of PBC disease progression biomarkers (ALP, ALT, AST and 
TB) and fibrosis scores (APRI and FIB-  4) were associated with 
increased risk of negative outcomes (Figure  2 and Table  S3). 
Regardless of ALP strata, and even when ALP was within ULN, 
PBC disease progression biomarkers and fibrosis scores were as-
sociated with an increased risk of negative outcomes (Figure  3 
and Table S4). Patients with FIB-  4 ≥ 3.25 and/or APRI > 0.5 had 
a consistently higher risk for negative outcomes than those with 
FIB-  4 < 1.3 and/or APRI ≤ 0.5. Despite low ALP levels (ALP 
≤ 1.67 × ULN), patients with ALT ≥ 2 × ULN or AST ≥ 1.5 × ULN 
had an increased risk for negative outcomes than patients with 
ALT or AST<ULN. Higher TB levels (> 1.0 × ULN) were also as -
sociated with an increased risk of negative outcomes regardless 
of ALP levels.
1778 Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 2025
There was a nearly six- fold increase in the risk of a negative out-
come in patients with elevations of TB ≥ 0.6 × ULN and ALP ≥ 
ULN (Figure  4) for 100% of follow- up time relative to patients 
who never exceeded these thresholds during follow- up. A pa -
tient with an elevation of ALP ≥ ULN for 3 years had a 71.0% 
increased risk of negative outcomes. When combined with a TB 
≥ 0.6 × ULN for the same period, the risk of these outcomes was 
2.89- fold greater than the risk in a patient who never exceeded 
these biomarker thresholds. In general, the combined risk as -
sociated with both biomarkers being above their thresholds be -
comes exponentially greater than the sum of the individual risks 
over time.
3.3   |   Sensitivity Analyses
In the sensitivity analyses of only patients with ICD-  10 diag -
nosis codes for PBC or excluding patients with baseline MASH 
and/or cirrhosis, the estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of a neg -
ative clinical outcome associated with hepatic biomarkers 
and fibrosis scores beyond established thresholds were sta -
tistically significant and similar in magnitude and direction 
across the various evaluated clinical thresholds (Table  S3). 
In the sensitivity analysis of patients without baseline MASH 
and/or cirrhosis, only FIB-  4 ≥ 1.3 was not statistically signif -
icant (Table S3 ).
4   |   Discussion
In our analyses of the prognostic value of each of the evaluated 
hepatic biomarkers and fibrosis scores among our study pop -
ulation, irrespective of ALP strata, elevated liver biochemical 
tests and fibrosis scores were associated with an increased risk 
of hospitalisation for hepatic decompensation, liver transplan -
tation or death, even when ALP was below ULN. Importantly, 
even in patients with low ALP levels, elevated ALT or AST in -
creased the risk of negative outcomes. Increasing magnitude 
and time spent beyond ULN for ALP, AST, ALT, TB (0.6 × ULN), 
APRI and FIB-  4 were associated with significantly greater risks 
of negative outcomes.
These findings suggest that using a more comprehensive set 
of commonly evaluated hepatic biomarkers and fibrosis scores 
may provide additional prognostic value in differentiating 
patients with PBC who are at a higher risk for negative clin -
ical outcomes. This approach aligns with the more recently 
developed criteria for assessing UDCA treatment response, 
stratifying risk for negative clinical outcomes and guiding 
management of patients with PBC [ 16, 35 ]. For example, the 
GLOBE scoring system incorporates age at initiation of UDCA 
therapy with TB level, ALP level, albumin level and platelet 
count measured at 12 months after initiation of UDCA treat -
ment [16], and the UK- PBC scoring system integrates baseline

albumin level and platelet count with TB, ALP and AST (or 
ALT) measured at 12 months after initiation of UDCA treat -
ment [35].
Furthermore, our findings indicate that routine monitoring of 
hepatic biomarkers and fibrosis scores in patients with PBC 
may allow for timely intervention with second-  line therapy 
to better mitigate the risk of negative clinical outcomes. We 
found that patients with TB ≥ 0.6 × ULN and ALP ≥ ULN for 
the entire follow- up period had a nearly six-  fold increased risk 
of a negative outcome compared with patients whose TB or 
ALP never exceeded these thresholds. This is consistent with 
previous studies showing that various thresholds of elevated 
TB or ALP levels are strongly associated with an increased 
risk of liver transplantation or death [ 36] and that patients 
with TB ≤  0.6 × ULN or normal ALP levels have a lower risk 
for these events [ 1]. Furthermore, the combination of ALP 
and TB levels has been shown to enhance prognostic predic -
tion [36].
The findings of our current study, along with those of Ritter 
et al. [30], underscore the importance of incorporating all avail -
able hepatic biomarkers and fibrosis scores beyond ALP as a 
continuous function into the assessment of clinical outcomes. 
This approach would provide a more comprehensive view of 
PBC management and treatment response, aiding in more in -
formed treatment decisions. A systematic review of 13 studies 
published between 2013 and 2019 in patients with metabolic 
dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease found that the 
noninvasive fibrosis scores, APRI and FIB-  4, are comparable to 
liver biopsy for predicting liver-  related morbidity and mortality 
[37], highlighting the importance and need for similar research 
in patients with PBC. Although the American Association for 
the Study of Liver Diseases [ 8] and European Association for 
the Study of the Liver [ 10] guidelines recommend assessing 
biochemical response to UDCA treatment after 1 year using 
established criteria, both guidelines note that these prognostic 
tools do not account for markers of disease stage. More frequent

inclusion of additional variables in assessments may be needed 
to better inform timely treatment decisions and affect the risk of 
negative clinical outcomes in patients with PBC.
The number, geographic scope, and diversity of patients in the 
Komodo Health database support the generalisability of the 
study findings among patients with PBC. However, our study 
has limitations. Biomarker levels and fibrosis scores were 
assumed to remain constant between recorded measurement 
time points. Fluctuations between measurements may have 
led to overestimating or underestimating the proportion of 
time beyond established thresholds and the risk of negative 
outcomes. The study findings reflect trends in the insured 
population only, and uninsured patients with PBC may have 
a different disease burden and progression than those ob -
served in this analysis. Additionally, the Komodo Healthcare

Map may not capture all laboratory values for all patients, and 
factors such as insurance coverage changes, data censoring 
and the time frame in which patients remain within the same 
healthcare system can impact follow- up duration. The median 
follow- up period of 2.5 years, combined with the 6-  month 
pre- index continuous enrolment, provides a total observation 
period of 3.0 years, which is similar to other claims database 
analyses, especially for those using data for patients with com -
mercial insurance [ 38]. A longer follow- up period could offer 
even greater insights into long-  term disease progression and 
outcomes for PBC.
In conclusion, our data suggest an increased risk of negative 
outcomes across multiple hepatic biomarkers and composite 
fibrosis scores, with a greater risk for patients whose bio -
markers and fibrosis scores remain above thresholds for lon -
ger periods of time. These findings support the importance of 
continued monitoring of ALT, AST, FIB-  4 and APRI, along 
with ALP and TB, when assessing the need to initiate first-   
and second-  line therapies. Furthermore, guidelines should 
consider routine monitoring of liver biomarkers and fibro -
sis scores beyond 1 year to better utilise available therapies 
and potentially reduce the overall risk of negative clinical 
outcomes. Timely monitoring and intervention are crucial for 
improving the prognosis and management of appropriate pa -
tients with PBC.
