Amine transaminases (ATAs), belonging to the class III transami-
nases within the superfamily of pyridoxal-5 0-phosphate-
dependent enzymes, catalyze transamination reactions between
amino donors and amino acceptors. These enzymes are particularly
appealing for their role in stereospecific synthesis of chiral amines.
However, the stability of most ATAs is not satisfying, limiting their
suitability for industrial applications. Among them, the amine trans-
aminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi(Sp-ATA) has drawn attention
due to its high activity and broad substrate scope under mild con-
ditions and high pH. Nevertheless, maintaining the activity at
higher temperatures is a challenge. Previous studies to enhance
enzyme function through directed evolution have shown promis-
ing results, yet predicting the cooperative effects of individual sta-
bilizing mutations remains challenging. An alternative strategy is
ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which is based on gene
sequences to create a more or less artificial phylogenetic tree. This
study aims to leverage ASR techniques to explore the thermosta-
bility, solvent tolerance, and substrate profile ofSp-ATA, to find
more stable transaminases. By usingSp-ATA as a template and
incorporating insights from ancestral sequences, this strategy
offers a promising approach for developing robust biocatalysts
suitable for industrial applications.
1. Introduction
Biocatalysis has emerged as an important technology in recent
years, especially in asymmetric synthesis, due to the stereoselec-
tivity, regioselectivity, and chemoselectivity of the biocatalysts,
which make the process more environmentally friendly and
simplified.[1–6] Chiral amines and their derivatives are widely
found in many active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and fine
chemicals.[7–9] They are high-value synthetic targets, as these
compounds often contain one or more stereocenters, and
controlling the overall stereochemistry is quite challenging.
Biocatalysis provides a more sustainable route for the synthesis
of high-purity chiral amines and their derivatives.[3,10,11] Currently,
biocatalysts used for the production of chiral amines mainly
include hydrolases, [12,13] oxidoreductases,[14,15] and transfer-
ases.[16] Amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) and imine reductases
(IREDs) have emerged with significant research focus over the
past decade due to their catalytic role in the amination of
ketones.[17–20] Despite their potential as alternatives to traditional
methods for chiral amine synthesis, transaminases still hold sig-
nificant potential for further investigation.[21–23] Transaminases
(TAs, EC 2.6.1.X) are enzymes that use the coenzyme pyridoxal
50-phosphate (PLP, a derivative of vitamin B6) to catalyze the
transfer of amino groups to carbonyl groups, playing a crucial role
in the synthesis of chiral amines and amino acids.[17,24] PLP forms
a Schiff base with a lysine residue in the active site in the first half-
cycle of the reaction as part of a“ping-pong bi-bi” mechanism.
The amino donor undergoes deamination to produce the donor
product and pyridoxamine-50-phosphate (PMP). As the amino
acceptor is aminated, PMP releases the amino group, forming
PLP and generating a new amine or amino acid.[25,26] TAs exhibit
a broad substrate range, efficient cofactor regeneration, and
excellent stereoselectivity, giving these enzymes advantages
not seen in other enzyme classes.[10,20,23] TAs play important roles
in industry and can reduce the need for expensive homogeneous
catalysts while lowering the high energy consumption associated
with downstream purification processes.[22]
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are distinguished by their ability
to aminate a wide range of ketones, aldehydes, and other car-
bonyl compounds, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of chiral
amines from prochiral ketones without requiring a carboxyl
group in the substrate. ATAs are one of the most versatile options
for chiral amine synthesis.[27] Among all ATAs, one particularly
interesting enzyme is a transaminase fromSilicibacter pomeroyi
(Sp-ATA, 3HMU) where a highly conserved arginine residue is

typically responsible for binding the carboxyl group at the active
site of transaminases. This flexible“flipping”Arg417 creates a cav-
ity in the active site that can accommodate the amino/ketone
group.[27–30] This flexibility givesSp-ATA a broad substrate scope.
However, despite its excellent catalytic properties, Sp-ATA has
limitations in stability.[31] Studies have shown thatSp-ATA exhibits
poor stability under extreme conditions such as high tempera-
tures and organic solvents, and instability of the cofactor
PLP.[23,32] Industrial processes demand enzymes that maintain
stability and catalytic efficiency under nonphysiological condi-
tions over time. Enzymes with poor stability tend to deactivate,
requiring frequent replenishment and complex enzyme immobi-
lization steps, which increase production costs.[33,34] Additionally,
industrial biocatalysis frequently involves harsh conditions, such
as high substrate concentrations, non-aqueous systems, and
extreme pH values,[35,36] making enzyme stability crucial for main-
taining activity and preventing downtime.[37] Thermostability is
widely regarded as a key factor in enhancing overall enzyme sta-
bility, as it strengthens protein structure and improves resistance
to extreme environments.[38] Studies show that thermostable
enzymes possess enhanced hydrogen bonding networks, hydro-
phobic cores, and disulfide bonds, making them more resilient
under industrial conditions. [39] Enhancing enzyme stability
ensures that it maintains catalytic activity under these conditions,
preventing downtime caused by enzyme deactivation, thus
improving production efficiency. However, Sp-ATA’s catalytic
activity diminishes significantly in these environments, restricting
its industrial applicability.[40]
To overcome these limitations, we aim to improve the stability
of Sp-ATA. A primary objective in engineering transaminases is
improving thermostability through various strategies, including
charge–charge interactions, proline substitutions, and the stabiliza-
tion of protein quaternary structures by preventing dimer
dissociation.[41–45] For instance, using B-factor analysis in combina-
tion with the proline rule, Land et al. improved the thermostability
of the amine transaminase fromChromobacterium violaceum.[41]
Cao et al. increased the thermostability and activity of a transami-
nase from Aspergillus terreus by identifying four surface-exposed
residues hypothesized to enhance thermal stability.[44] Enzyme
functions have been enhanced by directed evolution in the past,
but it is challenging to predict the effects of combining individual
stabilizing mutations.[46–49] Computational methods have also been
applied, but these are often time-consuming and require a detailed
structure to generate training data sets.[25,50] Therefore, an alterna-
tive method using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has
emerged as a potential solution,[51] which leverages evolutionary
history to identify residues critical for maintaining protein function.
Although less frequently used, ASR has shown potential as a tool

dots. Branch colors represent bootstrap values.

for engineering thermostable proteins.[52–54] Previous studies have
demonstrated that ASR can generate transaminases with broader
substrate scope and significantly improved catalytic activity, with
up to 20-fold increases in efficiency compared to modern
enzymes.[55] Notably, ASR-derived transaminases have exhibited
enhanced conversion of industrial feedstocks such as 12-amino-
dodecanoic acid, a key precursor for nylon-12. [52] Structural
analyses of the reconstructed enzymes revealed that substrate
preference was influenced by broader structural features beyond
the active site, highlighting the potential of ASR as a powerful alter-
native to traditional enzyme engineering.[55] Building on these
findings, we propose to screen and reconstruct more stable ances-
tral enzymes from a gene library based on the amino acid sequen-
ces of Sp-ATA. By expressing and characterizing some of these
ancestral enzymes, we aim to validate whether ASR can be applied
to enhance the stability of transaminases.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. ASR of ATAs
The enzymes in our panel exhibit 60%–95% sequence identity
with the benchmark enzyme,Sp-ATA. All amino acid sequences
of these enzymes are provided in the supplementary materials.
To identify ancestral enzymes with potentially higher thermosta-
bility, we selected sequences from bacteria that thrive at temper-
atures above 40 °C for ASR. The resulting phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1) was analyzed, and marginal reconstruction algorithms
with optimized likelihood scores were applied in FastML to gen-
erate ancestral proteins. Ancestral sequences were chosen from
the four closest nodes toSp-ATA (from closest to farthest: N51,
N50, N49, and N48) for further study. Among them, N48 and
Sp-ATA have the lowest sequence identity of only 87.1%.
Moving toward the youngest ancestor, N51, the sequence iden-
tity increases: from N49 with 88.7% to N50 with 92.2% and N51
showing the highest sequence identity of 94.3% (Table 1). The
decision to reconstruct these specific ancestors is based on their
evolutionary proximity toSp-ATA. By selecting these closer nodes,
we aim to retain a similar substrate range to that ofSp-ATA, as
they are expected to exhibit more similar structural and func-
tional characteristics compared to ancestors from more distant
nodes within the phylogenetic tree. This assumption relies on
the principle that genetic divergence accumulates over time,
making more distant ancestors likely to show greater differences
from the contemporary protein.[56]
2.2. Kinetics and Substrate Range of the Ancestral Enzyme
Variants
After successfully expressing and purifying soluble ancestral pro-
teins (Figure S2, Supporting Information), further assays were

Acetophenone formation was monitored at 245 nm, and standard devia-
tions were typically<20%.

conducted to determine the optimal pH for the ancestral enzyme
variants. The activities of the ancestral enzymes N48, N49, N50,
and N51 were tested in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5, 4-(2-
hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at
pH 8.2, and N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES)
buffer at pH 9.0. The acetophenone assay was used to measure
activity and confirm the selectivity of the selected ancestral
enzymes. To ensure the functional relevance of the selected
sequences, we experimentally tested the activity of the
reconstructed ancestral enzymes. N51, N50, and N49 exhibited
confirmed S-selective transaminase activity (Figure S3,
Supporting Information). This experimental verification mitigates
concerns about misclassification due to automatic annotation.[32]
Additionally, structural analysis based on homology modeling
described in the following section further supports the expected
activity and selectivity of these enzymes. The results showed that
all ancestral enzymes, except N48 (which, despite being soluble,
exhibited no activity, likely due to improper folding or active site
structural constraints), along with the wild-typeSp-ATA, performed
best in the pH 9.0 CHES buffer (Figure S3, Supporting Information),
consistent with previous results.[30] As for N51, although its phylo-
genetic position suggests activity similar to the wild type, its
significantly lower activity may be attributed to factors beyond
sequence similarity, such as the need for post-translational mod-
ifications,[57] folding issues, or molecular interactions. N51 was
excluded from further analyses due to its significantly lower activity
compared toSp-ATA wild type. To compare the catalytic efficiency
of ancestral enzymes withSp-ATA, we measured the kinetic param-
eters (Vmax, Km,a n dkcat)o fSp-ATA, N49, and N50 with the substrate
(S)-PEA. As shown inFigure 2, the ancestral enzymes displayed
decreased catalytic efficiency relative toSp-ATA, which may indi-
cate either a reduction in overall catalytic ability or that (S)-PEA is
not their optimal substrate. A plausible explanation could be that
these thermostable enzymes tend to have a more rigid structure
at room temperature, requiring higher temperatures for
optimal activity.[56,58] Additionally, evolutionary changes in the
ancestral proteins may have led to the loss of activity, particularly
in N48, which is the most ancestral of the four proteins. While the
phylogenetic tree provides insights into evolutionary relationships,
it does not always predict functional outcomes, especially when
unexpected structural or dynamic changes occur.[59] Further mod-
ifications in the ancestral proteins might contribute to reduced
activity, potentially due to new interactions between different
regions (e.g., the active site), which could enhance stability but

compromise activity. These findings are consistent with the broader
goal of engineering enzymes for enhanced thermal stability, where
improved stability may come at the cost of reduced catalytic activ-
ity due to structural rigidity or altered active site interactions.
The activities of the ancestral variants were then screened
against nine amine donors, which included three aromatics
(Figure 3b, 1–3), three aliphatic monoamines (Figure 3b,4–6),
and three aliphatic diamines (Figure 3b,7–9), all at 5 mM concen-
tration. For the aromatic amine donors, sodium pyruvate served
as the amine acceptor. For the aliphatic donors, the aromatic
acceptor 4-phenyl-2-butanone (PEB) was used to allow detection
with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) UV
detector (Figure 3b). Results displayed in Figure 3c indicate the
product conversion rates with substrates2–9 (the reactions num-
bered as the applied substrates) relative to (S)-PEA. Compared to
Sp-ATA, N49 showed an interesting loss of conversion for2 but a
significant increase for3. This shift in substrate preference may be
attributed to structural changes in the active site, particularly the
repositioning of key amino acids influencing substrate binding.
Specifically, the outward-facing F92 (F94) side chain in N49 may
increase the space in the binding pocket, making it easier for larger
substrates like substrate3 to enter. In contrast, substrate2,w h i c hi s
smaller, may require a tighter binding pocket, and the altered
pocket structure in N49 may reduce or eliminate its binding affin-
ity. Additionally, N49 exhibited nearly no reactivity with reactions
7–9 compared toSp-ATA. N50 demonstrated alternative substrate
selectivity, with enhanced activity for reactions 4 and 5 and
markedly reduced activity for7 and 8. This shift suggests that
changes in the active site architecture may have optimized
N50 for binding smaller aliphatic amines. Notably, in N50, the
inward-facing R417 (R426) may cause the active pocket to be more
suited for smaller, straight-chain amine substrates, enhancing the
binding affinity for substrates like propylamine and butylamine.
This phenomenon has been confirmed in previous studies, where
thermostable enzymes exhibited superior activity at higher tem-
peratures compared to their less thermostable counterparts.
Additionally, sequence and structural changes in the ancestral var-
iants may also contribute to a decrease in activity.[58,60] We propose
that structural changes in the active site have led to alterations in
the substrate range of the ancestral enzymes. To better understand
how conformational change affects the substrate domain and
activity of N49 and N50, we analyzed the secondary structure of
Sp-ATA, N49, and N50 using circular dichroism spectroscopy
(Figure 4a). Compared toSp-ATA, both N49 and N50 show distinct
differences in the composition of their secondary structure ele-
ments (α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and random coils) (Figure 4b).
These structural differences may significantly impact the enzyme’s
substrate domain and activity, contributing to the observed shifts
in substrate preference.
2.3. Computational Analysis of Structural Differences and
Active Site Conservation in Ancestral Proteins
To visualize the impact of structural differences in the active site,
homology modeling was employed. Alignment of the homology-
modeled structures for the ancestral proteins with the wild-type
Sp-ATA showed a high degree of similarity (Figure 5b). For a more
precise analysis, docking simulations with PLP-PEA were con-
ducted to assess the active site, yielding an interesting observa-
tion. As reported by Steffen –Munsberg et al.[28] the residues
forming the active site— including Lys258, responsible for form-
ing an internal aldimine with PLP, Asp259, which stabilizes and
orients PLP during catalysis, and Arg417, which plays a role in
substrate binding and specificity— are conserved across all four
ancestral proteins as well as the wild-type Sp-ATA (Figure 5a).
From a structural perspective, this suggests that the observed
changes in activity and stability in the ancestral enzymes may arise
from alterations in regions outside the active site. However, com-
pared toSp-ATA, the residue numbering in the ancestral proteins
has changed, although their positions are nearly similar. The num-
bers in parentheses correspond to the ancestral proteins, while
those outside correspond to theSp-ATA wild type. Additionally,
further analysis of the ancestral sequences through multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) (Figure S2, Supporting Information)
revealed amino acid insertions in certain regions, which are illus-
trated in one subunit of N49 (Figure S3, Supporting Information)
and are normal occurrences in ancestral enzymes. Furthermore, in
the same study onSp-ATA, Steffen–Munsberg et al.[28] highlighted

ATA. a) Circular dichroism spectra ofSp-ATA, N49, and N50 at 200–280 nm

sured in a 1 mm path-length cuvette. Spectra were averaged over five
scans, baseline-corrected, and plotted using Prism GraphPad.

the key role of the“flipping” arginine residue (R417), which is cru-
cial for dual substrate recognition. When R417 points towards the
PLP, it can acceptα-carboxylic substrates. Conversely, when the
arginine flips upwards in the active site, it creates a larger binding
pocket, enabling the binding of larger substrates, such as (S)-PEA.
When each ancestral protein is aligned withSp-ATA, this arginine
adopts a more extended conformation towards PLP-PEA across all
ancestral proteins compared to its conformation in Sp-ATA
(Figure 5a). This may suggest that (S)-PEA is less favored as an
amino donor for these enzymes.
To further validate the docking results and our hypothesis,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the
docked structures of Sp-ATA, N49, and N50 with PLP-PEA.
The simulations revealed distinct conformational differences
in the “flipping” arginine residue, further supporting our obser-
vations. As shown inFigure 6,i nSp-ATA, the “flipping” arginine
extends outward, positioned farther from the PLP-PEA ligand. In
N49, the arginine exhibits partial inward flipping, while in N50, it
adopts the most pronounced inward conformation. Additionally,
analysis of the shortest pairwise distance between the flipping
arginine and PLP-PEA (Figure 6d) corroborates these structural dif-
ferences: Sp-ATA exhibits the largest distance, followed by N49,
while N50 has the shortest distance. These findings reinforce
our hypothesis that the altered flipping behavior of this arginine
residue in ancestral proteins may influence their substrate speci-
ficity and catalytic properties.
2.4. The Ancestral Variants Exhibit a Significant Increase in
Thermostability
Research has frequently highlighted the greater stability of ances-
tral enzymes compared to their modern counterparts. To investi-
gate this stability, we measured half-inactivation temperature
(T50
15) and the half-life (t1/2) of the ancestral enzymes (Figure 7).
For instance, N49 showed a T50
15 of 54.9 °C, an increase of about
4 °C over the T50
15 of the wild-type Sp-ATA, which is 51 °C
(Figure 7a,c). Additionally, the half-life of N49 extended twofold,
from 5 to 10.3 min (Figure 7d,f ). N50, in comparison, exhibited
even more significant stability enhancements, with a T50
15 of
6 °C increase and a half-life extended by 3.7 times to 18.6 min
(Figure 7b,e). These results suggest the potential of ancestral
reconstruction as an effective strategy for enhancing enzyme
stability. To address concerns regarding potential renaturation
effects after heat treatment, we ensured strict consistency in tem-
perature control and conducted activity assays immediately after
cooling. While renaturation could theoretically influence measured

PSI-BLAST, and 25 models per ancestor were generated and refined. Hybrid structures were analyzed, and molecular docking used these models alongside
the Sp-ATA crystal structure (PDB: 3HMU) with PLP (PDB: 3FCR). Structures were aligned in YASARA, with SO4 and obstructive H2O removed. PLP proton-
ation was adjusted, a 5 Å simulation cell was set, and energy minimization was performed using the AMBER03 force field. Fifty docking simulations were
run with AutodockLGA to evaluate binding poses. All images were generated using PyMOL.

activity, the observed significant increase in thermostability among
ancestral enzymes strongly suggests an inherent stabilization
effect rather than a transient recovery. The marked increases in

their activity was measured at 22 °C. An exponential decay model in GraphPad Prism 10 was used to analyze the data and determine the point of 50%
activity loss. Furthermore, the enzymes were subjected to 15-min incubations at temperatures ranging from 37 to 61 °C and then cooled before assessing
activity. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.

advantages. This stability may stem from structural features that
enhance robustness at elevated temperatures, a hypothesis that
is worth further investigation to identify specific structural contrib-
utors to this enhanced stability. The superior stability of N49 and
N50 makes them particularly promising for industrial processes,
thus broadening the practical applications of transaminases.
While ancestral reconstruction offers stability benefits, a well-
known limitation of the ASR method is the challenge of linking
structural modifications to functional outcomes. [61] Numerous
amino acid substitutions are present in the ancestral proteins,
scattered across different protein regions— particularly in loops
and α-helices (Figure 5c and S1, Supporting Information).
Although pinpointing the exact contribution of each substitution
remains challenging, the distribution of these substitutions may
guide further rational design, focusing on regions that could
improve the thermal stability of other transaminases.
2.5. Organic Solvents Stability
To determine the enzyme tolerance to the reaction media, the wild
type, N49, and N50 were incubated in 10, 20, 30, and 40% concen-
trations of MeOH, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile for 2,
4, and 6 h, followed by a 20 h reaction to measure the acetophe-
none yield (Figure 8). Results showed that the presence of DMSO
significantly enhanced the activity of ancestral enzymes N49 and
N50, a phenomenon not observed in the wild-type Sp-ATA
(Figure 8b). Specifically, N49 displayed an increase in activity in
10%–30% DMSO, with activity more than triple after a 2-h incuba-
tion in 20% DMSO. N50 also showed slight activity enhancements
in 10% and 20% DMSO. However, both ancestral enzymes experi-
enced activity loss in 40% of DMSO. In contrast, the wild-type
Sp-ATA performed poorly in all DMSO concentrations, retaining
only about half of its activity in 40% DMSO. In the presence of
MeOH, the wild-typeSp-ATA exhibited only a minor decrease in
catalytic activity with increasing concentration and incubation time
(Figure 8a). For instance, after a 6-h incubation in 40% MeOH,
Sp-ATA retained around 70% of its activity. However, N49 showed
significant declines in activity with increasing MeOH concentration
and incubation time. After 6 h in 10% MeOH, N49 retained 72% of
its activity, but this dropped to 31% in 20% MeOH and only 24% in
40% MeOH. In acetonitrile, the ancestral enzymes showed the
poorest tolerance, while the wild-type Sp-ATA displayed some
degree of resistance (Figure 8c). This variation in enzyme stability
and activity across different solvents can be attributed to how the
solvents interact with the protein. Acetonitrile is a polar aprotic sol-
vent, which can destabilize the enzyme’s native conformation,
causing protein unfolding and reduced activity.[62] In contrast,
DMSO, also a polar aprotic solvent with strong hydrogen bond-
accepting ability,[63] possibly stabilizes the enzyme’s secondary
and tertiary structures by preserving essential surface hydration
through its S═O structure, thereby enhancing enzyme stability
and activity.[64] Overall, this experiment reveals differences in reac-
tion medium tolerance between the ancestral enzymes and the
wild-type Sp-ATA, which provides understanding and insights
for developing industrial enzymes.
3. Conclusion
This study utilized ASR with the amino acid sequence ofSp-ATA
as a template. Four ancestral enzymes (N48, N49, N50, and N51)
were selected from branches closest toSp-ATA for further inves-
tigation. The study showed that all four ancestral enzymes were
successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Among these,
N49 and N50 exhibited promising catalytic activity and substrate
specificity distinct fromSp-ATA, whereas N48 showed no activity
with the amino donor (S)-PEA, and N51 had negligible activity.
The ancestral enzymes N49 and N50 also demonstrated
improved thermal stability with an increase in T50
15 values by
3.9 and 6 °C, respectively, relative toSp-ATA, and their half-lives
(t1/2) at 55 °C were extended 2.06 to 3.72 times before reaching
inactivation. Furthermore, we compared solvent tolerance across
the ancestral enzymes and found that both N49 and N50 dis-
played a preference for DMSO. In lower concentrations of

Purified enzymes were incubated in a mixture of organic solvent (0%, 10%,
20%, 30%, and 40% v v/C0 1) and CHES buffer. Residual enzyme activity was
then determined using an acetophenone assay and measured by HPLC.
Reactions without enzymes as blanks, while those without organic solvents
were controls. All reactions were performed in triplicates.

DMSO, they exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity.
However, their tolerance to methanol and acetonitrile was lower
than that of the wild-type enzyme. These findings provide valu-
able insights into enzyme adaptability to specific solvents and
strategies for enhancing enzyme thermal stability, thereby sup-
porting the use of biocatalysts in industrial applications.
Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of enzyme structure will
be crucial to precisely control modifications, preserving high
activity and substrate specificity while boosting stability.
4. Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals of analytical or higher grade were purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich Sweden. Yeast extract, tryptone, agar and ampicillin
were purchased from Merck Sweden. Agarose and NaCl were
obtained from VWR Sweden. The Ni/NTA His Bind resin for His-trap
column was purchased from Merck Sweden. The PD10 column was
purchased from Cytiva Sweden.
Medium, Plasmids, and Strains
The lysogeny broth medium (LB, 10 g L/C0 1 NaCl, 10 g L/C0 1 tryptone, and
5gL /C0 1 yeast extract, pH 7.0) was utilized for growingE. colicultures.
Protein expression was conducted in terrific broth (TB, 16 g L/C0 1 tryp-
tone, 10 g L/C0 1 yeast extract, NaCl, pH 7.0). Agar was added to a final
concentration of 1.5% to prepare solid medium. 5 g L/C0 1 Ampicillin
was added to the medium at a concentration of 100μgm L/C0 1. The
strains E. coliXL1-Blue and BL21(DE3) were used for plasmid amplifi-
cation and expression respectively.
Sequence Collection
The amino acid sequence ofSp-ATA (PDB: 3HMU) was used as a query
to retrieve homologous transaminase sequences. The search was
conducted against the UniProtKB database (https://www.unipro-
t.org/) using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) with
default parameters. Unique sequences were identified and cleaned
using the CD-HIT[65] program with a 90% sequence identity threshold
to ensure nonredundant data. The resulting sequences were manu-
ally reviewed to remove false positives, including those shorter than
400 or longer than 600 residues, as well as sequences with clear
duplicates or missing fragments. Further data cleaning was per-
formed by removing sequences with more than 97% identity to
Sp-ATA. Furthermore, an automated script was created using
Python, incorporating Matplotlib 3.7.1, [66] NumPy 1.26.2, [67] and
Pandas 1.5.3 module (Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13819579). The
script was used to filter out sequences from microorganisms with
optimal growth temperatures below 40 °C. Furthermore, we validated
the presence of the PLP-dependent transferase domain using
InterPro annotations,[68] confirming that all sequences belong to
the same structural and phylogenetic family asSp-ATA. These filtering
criteria minimized the risk of including unrelated or nonfunctional
sequences and ensured a robust foundation for MSA and phyloge-
netic tree construction. The final dataset contained 75 sequences.
MSA and Phylogenetic Analysis
A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the dataset was generated
using MAFFT[69] with the FFT-NS-I /C2 1000 algorithm (fast fourier
transform-based progressive alignment with iterative refinement),
which is known for its high alignment accuracy and efficiency in
handling large-scale datasets. This advanced alignment strategy incor-
porates FFT and iterative optimization to achieve high computational
efficiency while maintaining alignment precision. Given the scale of
the dataset and the need for both speed and accuracy, the
FFT-NS-I /C2 1000 algorithm was particularly suitable for the analysis
of this work. Multiple runs of the algorithm were performed to obtain
consistent results, which confirmed the stability of the outcome.
Additionally, the alignment results were compared with those from
ClustalW, yielding similar outcomes and further validating the accu-
racy of the FFT-NS-I /C2 1000 algorithm. Gaps within the aligned
sequences were removed, and a maximum likelihood (ML) phyloge-
netic tree was constructed in IQ-TREE using the Jones-Taylor-
Thornton substitution (JTT) model with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
ASR was performed with FastML,[70] and the ancestral tree was visu-
alized in iTOL.[71] Homology modeling of the ancestral sequences
was carried out in YASARA (version 23.12.24)[72] and visualized using
PyMOL (version 4.6.0).[73]
Expression and Purification
The genes encoding ancestral enzymes were synthesized and cloned
into pET22b (þ) with ampicillin resistance by Twist Bioscience (San
Francisco, USA). The plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL1-
Blue. For Sp-ATA, the gene was previously cloned into pET22b (þ)
with ampicillin resistance. For overexpression, plasmids pET22b-Sp-
ATA, pET22b-N48, pET22b-N49, pET22b-N50, and pET22b-N51 were
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Colonies were grown in LB with
50 μgm L/C0 1 ampicillin at 37 °C, 220 RPM. Protein expression was
induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6, followed by incubation
at 20 °C, 200 RPM for 20 h. Cells were harvested (4,000 /C2 g,
20 min, 4 °C), resuspended (1:1.5, w v/C0 1) in lysis buffer, lysed via soni-
cation, and centrifuged (15 000/C2 g, 20 min, 4 °C) to collect the super-
natant. For purification, 1 mL of Ni-NTA agarose was loaded into a
column, and the cell lysate was allowed to pass the column. The col-
umn was then washed with washing buffers 1 and 2 (50 mM NaCl,
and 20 mM or 50 mM imidazole) to remove contaminants. Target pro-
tein was eluted with 0.5 mL of buffer with 50 mM NaCl, and 300 mM
imidazole. Desalting was performed using a PD-10 column. Purified
proteins were analyzed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, Bio-Rad TGX gel), run at
220 V for 30 min in 1/C2 SDS-Tris buffer. SeeBlue Plus2 Pre-stained
Protein Standard was used as standard and Sigma Laemmli 2 /C2
Concentrate were used as sample buffers (20μL per sample). For
dimer formation, enzymes were incubated with 5 mM PLP at 4°C
overnight. Then, excess PLP was removed using PD10 column with
either 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.2) or 50 mM CHES buffer (pH 9.0).
Enzyme Activity Assay
The conversion of (S)-1-phenylethylamine (PEA) to acetophenone[74]
was monitored at 245 nm using an extinction coefficient of
12 mM/C0 1 cm/C0 1. Acetophenone formation was measured every 5 s
over a 3-min period with a Cary50 ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectropho-
tometer, using 1 mL UV cuvettes. The assay was conducted at 22 °C,
with a typical reaction mixture (1 mL) consisting of 5–50 μgo fa n
enzyme, 2.5 mM PEA, and 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate in different buf-
fers. To determine the optimal pH of the ancestral enzyme, the reac-
tions were carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 6.0 and pH 7.5,
in HEPES buffer at pH 8.2, and in CHES buffer at pH 9.0. All measure-
ments were performed in triplicate, and protein samples were incu-
bated at 22 °C for 1 h before the assay.
Kinetic Analysis
Kinetic assays were performed in triplicate using a microplate reader.
The acetophenone assay was performed to assess the kinetic analysis.

The PEA was an amine donor, and Na-pyruvate was used as an amino
acceptor. To obtain the Michaelis–Menten constant (Kapp
M), six differ-
ent concentrations of (S)-PEA, ranging from 0.1 to 15 mM, were used.
Reactions were started by adding 10μg enzyme with 5 mM PLP. The
generation of acetophenone followed over time by measuring the
245 nm absorbance. The standard deviations for the determined
kinetic parameters were typically<20%.
Secondary Structure Assessment
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a Chirascan CD
spectrometer. Protein samples were prepared at a concentration of
0.1 in 50 mM CHES buffer at pH 9.0, with a sample volume of 400μL.
The measurements were carried out in a 1 mm path-length cuvette.
The UV range spanned from 200 to 280 nm, using a quartz cell with a
0.2 mm path length. The scan speed was set to 50 nm min/C0 1, with a
response time of 1 s, and a total of five scans were accumulated.
Baseline correction was applied to all spectra, and the data was sub-
sequently plotted using Prism GraphPad (version 10.2).
Thermostability Determination
Both the half-inactivation temperature (T50
15) and half-life (t1/2) values
characterize the thermostability of the enzyme. T50
15 refers to the
temperature at which the enzyme activity was reduced to half of
the original activity after heat treatment at a continuous temperature
for 15 min. The enzyme solution was incubated for 15 min at temper-
atures of 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, and 61 °C and then cooled on
ice for 10 min. Using the Levenberg–Marquardt iterative algorithm,
the data were fitted to a four-parameter Boltzmann sigmoidal func-
tion. The formula is presented in Equation (1).
R ¼ A þð B /C0 AÞ= 1 þ eðTm /C0 TÞ=C/C0/C1
(1)
where A and B represent pretransition and post-transitional residual
activity, respectively, at temperatureT. C is the slope factor, control-
ling the steepness of the curve or the temperature sensitivity.T is the
current temperature. T0 is the temperature in the absence of treat-
ment. In the absence of treatment, Tm = T0, when there is no
treatment.
Similarly, t1/2 is defined as the time when the residual activity ofSp-
ATA and its ancestors was reduced to 50% of its original activity. For
the study, we measured the t1/2 at 55 °C. The purifiedSp-ATA, N49,
N50, and N51 variants were incubated for 0–60 min at 55 °C and then
cooled on ice for 10 min. The enzyme activity test was performed at
22 °C for 3 min with a spectrophotometer under 245 nm. The data
was fitted with an exponential function model: [Y= (Y0 - Plateau)
* exp(-K*X) þ Plateau] (Y0, Y -value at X = 0, same unites as Y;
Plateau, Y -value at infinite time, same units as Y; and K, rate constant,
reciprocal of X -axis units) by nonlinear regression using GraphPad
Prism 10 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and then the
50% of relative enzyme activity were determined.
Substrate Scope Screening
To evaluate the substrate scope of ancestral enzymes compared to
Sp-ATA, nine amine donors were selected. The substrate spectrum of
the ancestral enzymes was determined at 30 °C in a 0.5 mL reaction
mixture containing 50 mM CHES buffer (pH 9.0), 10 mM acceptor
(sodium pyruvate and PEB for R4-9), the nine amine donors
(Figure 3b), 1 mM PLP, and 0.5 mg of purified enzyme. The conversion
of (S)-PEA (following acetylation) to acetophenone was measured
after 20 h via HPLC, using a flow rate of 1 mL min/C0 1, a mobile phase
of 20/80% v v/C0 1 acetonitrile and water with 1% trifluoroacetic acid,
and detection at 245 nm.
Solvent Tolerance
The impact of different concentrations of water-miscible organic
solvents (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% v v/C0 1), viz., DMSO, methanol,
and acetonitrile, on enzyme activity was assessed by incubating
purified enzymes in a mixture of organic solvent and CHES buffer
for 2, 4, and 6 h at 25 °C. Residual enzyme activity was then deter-
mined using an acetophenone assay and measured by HPLC. A
reaction without enzyme served as the blank, while a reaction
without organic solvent was used as the control. All reactions were
performed in triplicates.
Homology Modeling and Molecular Docking Simulations
The homology modeling in YASARA used the macro hm_build.mcr,
modifying the oligo state from 4 to 2 for dimeric structures. It iden-
tified ancestral sequences and templates through PSI-BLAST. After
secondary structure predictions, 25 models per ancestor were built
and refined in two steps. The best models were combined into
hybrid structures for final analysis. Molecular docking simulations
utilized the homology-modeled structures and crystal structure
3HMU for Sp-ATA, incorporating the essential cofactor PLP from
PDB: 3FCR. Structures were aligned in YASARA, with SO 4 and
obstructive H 2O molecules removed. The PLP protonation state
was adjusted, and a simulation cell extending 5 Å was defined
and filled with water. The AMBER03 force field was used for energy
minimization. Pro-(S)-quinonoid complexes of PEA (PLP_PEA) were
constructed, maintaining specific dihedral angles. Fifty independent
docking simulations were executed with dock_run.mcr and
AutodockLGA, evaluating binding poses and modes for PLP_PEA
across structures.
MD Simulation
MD simulations were performed on the docked structures ofSp-ATA,
N49, and N50, each complexed with PLP_PEA and PLP at the dimer
active site. All simulations were conducted using GROMACS 2024.2
(Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.11148655). The AMBER99SB-ILDN
force field was used to parametrize the protein, while the TIP3P
was employed for water. Ligands were parametrized using the
GRAFF force field[75,76] via ACPYPE.[77] Each system was placed in a
triclinic periodic box with a volume of ≈1500 nm3, filled with
TIP3P water molecules, and neutralized with Cl/C0 ions. Energy minimi-
zation was performed using the steepest descent algorithm for
50 000 steps or until convergence at–1000 kJ nm mol/C0 1. The systems
were equilibrated under NVT (constant volume and temperature
equilibration run), followed by NPT (constant pressure and tempera-
ture equilibration run), for 200 ps each at 300 K. A 100 ns production
run was then carried out, and the resulting trajectories were analyzed.
The VMD program[78] was used to visualize the docked substrate and
the “flipping”arginine. Quantitative analysis was conducted using the
GROMACS gmx pairdist function, and the results were plotted using
Python 3.9.16 with Matplotlib 3.7.1.
