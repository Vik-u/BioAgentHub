Many single-use non-degradable plastics are a threat to life today, and several
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biopolymers have been developed in the bioplastic
industry to place petrochemical-based plastics. One of such is the novel biomaterial
poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HP)] because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and high yield synthesis using engineered strains. To date, many bio-polymer-based
functional composites have been developed to increase the value of raw microbial-
biopolymers obtained from cheap sources. This review article broadly covers poly(3HP),
a comprehensive summary of critical biosynthetic production pathways comparing
the yields and titers achieved in different Microbial cell Factories. This article also
provides extensive knowledge and highlights recent progress on biosensors’ use to
optimize poly(3HP) production, some bacteria host adopted for production, chemical
and physical properties, life cycle assessment for poly(3HP) production using corn oil as
carbon source, and some essential medical applications of poly(3HP).

INTRODUCTION
Poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HP)] is a promising monomer of the polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA) family of material properties similar to other short chain lengths (SCL) PHAs like poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3HB)]. It is a well-characterized polyester, biodegradable, biocompatible,
and has excellent mechanical properties such as high ﬂexibility, high tensile strength, and
high rigidity but more stable than polylactic acid (Andreeﬂen et al., 2010, 2014b). Poly(3HP)
homopolymer biosynthesis came to the limelight in 2010, using glycerol as a carbon source in a two-
step fed-batch fermentation and proved to be a promising alternative petrochemical-derived plastic.

Aduhene et al. Poly (3-hydroxypropionate) Biosynthesis Pathways and Properties
Within half a century, glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel
production, has become a common carbon source for several
biotechnological research in the world. Due to environmental
pollution associated with the petrochemical industry resulting
in climate change and overexploited fossil reserves, there needs
to use biological approaches through metabolic engineering to
produce many chemicals from non-renewable sources using
inexpensive and abundant raw materials (Keasling, 2010).
The eﬀectiveness and success of the biological production
of a platform chemical like 3-hydroxypropoic acid (3-HP) are
dependent on the development of microbial Cell Factories;
thus prompting vigorous and extensive researches conducted
in diverse ﬁelds such as biosynthesis, gene ampliﬁcation,
engineering of enzymes, design of the genetic circuit, genome
editing, bioinformatics, adaptive laboratory evolution,
multiomics using suitable hosts, and biosynthetic pathways
of microorganisms through the process called “Design-Build-
Test-Learn (DBTL)” cycles (Li et al., 2012; Abatemarco et al.,
2013; Cheong et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016). Furthermore, to
commercialize these processes through eﬀective biosynthetic
pathways to achieve economically viable products, biosensors
must be constructed in a suitable metabolic route, optimized to
produce desirable results (Liu et al., 2015a).
In order to increase yields of PHAs through synthetic
biotechnology and metabolic engineering, there has been the use
of metabolite biosensors to detect and monitor a target metabolite
in vivo by high-throughput screening (HTS) (Eggeling et al.,
2015). Although previous review papers have discussed some
biosynthetic pathways, material and chemical characteristics of
poly(3HP) (Andreeﬂen et al., 2014b; Chang et al., 2018), however,
this review extensively discusses up to date the metabolic
pathways that can be used to produce poly(3HP) from glycerol
and glucose. The paper also focuses on the production host,
the use of malonyl-CoA biosensors to optimize yield, life cycle
assessment for poly(3HP) production using corn oil as a carbon
source, and the physical and chemical properties. Finally, we will
highlight some applications of poly(3HP).
PHAs
Polyhydroxyalkanoates are classes of intracellular, linear high
molecular aliphatic bacterial storage polyesters, which are
biocompatible thermoplastics and biodegradable into carbon
dioxide and water by many microorganisms (Zhang et al., 2018).
Physical or material properties of PHAs are similar to petroleum-
derived plastics but exhibit some diﬀerent characteristics ranging
from brittleness to ﬂexibility and elasticity, as shown in Table 1
(Muhammadi et al., 2015). PHA polymers exhibition of features
such as elasticity, ﬂexibility, biodegradability, and renewability
are highly dependent on these factors, namely; (1) their
biosynthesis pathways of production (Masood et al., 2014), (2)
monomeric composition (Luzi et al., 2019), and (3) chemical
structure (Bugnicourt et al., 2014).
Furthermore, the production of PHAs is currently not
economical in comparison to that of synthetic plastics. To
make bacterial PHAs production cost-eﬀective, a few critical
factors need to be addressed, such as screening and selection of
potential bacterial strains (Kumar et al., 2016, 2020), synthesis
pathways, advanced tools and technologies (Mo ˙zejko-Ciesielska
and Mostek, 2019), carbon and nitrogen source (Zahari et al.,
2014), and cost-eﬃcient down-stream pro-cesses (Koller and
Braunegg, 2018). The purposeful application of the PHAs is also
a crucial factor determining its importance and economy (Chen
et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2019).
Many researchers have channeled their interest in the
production of PHAs recently due to inexpensive carbon sources
as substrate and the dangerous problem associated with single-
use plastic waste disposal (Chen and Patel, 2012).
Previously, ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of
β-propiolactone and 3-HP ester condensation was the chemical
processes for synthesizing poly(3HP). There has been no
evidence of a natural organism capable of synthesizing it (Wang
et al., 2012, 2013; Heinrich et al., 2013).
However, poly(3HP) was not commercially feasible to
produce in large quantities because β-propiolactone as a
substrate has carcinogenic properties (Dunn, 2012; Dunn
et al., 2016). 3-HP , which has low crystallinity, is an ideal
precursor that forms a constituent for several copolymers like
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HB-
co-3HP)] or poly(3-hydroxypropionate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)
[Poly(3HP-co-4HB)] (Zhou et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013).
3-hydroxypropoic acid, acrylate, and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-
PDO) were previously utilized as dependent precursors for
the biosynthesis of poly(3HP) and 3-HP-containing copolymer
(Gao et al., 2014). However, these expensive precursors and
Vitamin B 12 increased poly(3HP) production cost making it
economically not feasible.
Artiﬁcial pathways were constructed for poly(3HP)
biosynthesis from inexpensive carbon sources such as glucose
and glycerol without the addition of precursors to remedy the
challenges arising from high production costs (Andreeﬂen et al.,
2010). Nevertheless, only 13 mg/L poly(3HP) was produced by
recombinant Escherichia coli strain using glucose as a substrate.
Andreeﬂen et al. (2010) produced 1.42 mg/L poly(3HP) by
glycerol conversion using a recombinant E. coli strain carrying
glycerol dehydratase of Clostridium buytricum DhaB1Cb ,
propionaldehyde dehydrogenase of Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium LT2 (PduPSe), and PHA synthase gene ofRalstonia
eutropha HI6 (PhaC1Re) in a two-step fed-batch fermentation
process (Andreeﬂen et al., 2010).
METABOLIC PATHWAYS FOR THE
SYNTHESIS OF POLY(3HP)
Several microorganisms have been reported to artiﬁcially produce
poly(3HP) through microbial genetic modiﬁcation using various
routes and diﬀerent substrates such as glucose and glycerol with
the addition of some precursors (Wang et al., 2014).
Traditional Pathways
In the traditional routes of biosynthesis of poly(3HP), there is
dehydration of glycerol in the propionaldehyde dehydrogenase
route (PduP route) 3-HP route. However, there is no such

dehydration of glycerol in the Malonyl-CoA route, and there is
no restriction concerning the use of a speciﬁc carbon source.
The PduP Route
In 2010, the ﬁrst known route for biosynthesis of poly(3HP) was
established and composed of these three steps: (i) dehydration
of glycerol (ii) 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) oxidation,
and CoA ligation to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA), and
(iii) polymerization of 3-HP-CoA to poly(3HP) (Andreeﬂen
et al., 2010). In recent years, glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel
production, has become the most attractive carbon source
for synthesizing various biological products. Its availability,
however, exceeded the demand for regular consumption in the
chemical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Interestingly,
in the transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oil or animal fat with
methanol, 10% of the product is glycerol (Quispe et al., 2013),
causing a sharp drop in glycerol price. Therefore, poly(3HP)
synthesis from cheap glycerol can reduce costs and improve
economic eﬃciency.
A two-step fed-batch fermentation process was used in 2010
for the synthesis of poly(3HP); the cells were maintained and
propagated in an anaerobic phase with a reducing agent, which
then accumulates 1.4 g/L of poly(3HP), accounting for 12% of
the cell dry weight ( Table 2 ; Andreeﬂen et al., 2010). Upon
further analysis, Andreeﬂen et al. (2010) concluded that the
DhaB1Cb is only active under strictly anaerobic conditions. The
maintenance of anaerobic conditions is achieved by reducing
agents (disodium fumarate and sodium potassium tartrate),
increasing the production cost, and producing a relatively low
yield (Andreeﬂen et al., 2010).
In another study, a bacterial strain of high yielding poly(3HP)
ability was developed using a fermentation process in the
presence of vitamin B 12-dependent glycerol dehydratase gene
dhaB123Kp and the helper gene ( gdrABKp) in Klebsiella
pneumonia with low oxygen sensitivity to replace DhaB1 from
Salmonella typhimurium . The propionaldehyde dehydrogenase
gene (pduPSt) of S. typhimurium and the phaC1Re was expressed
in E. coli (Wang et al., 2013).
In the optimization strategy, the poly(3HP) anaerobic
accumulation phase in the experiment was omitted by not
adding disodium fumarate and sodium-potassium tartrate
reducing agents. This method, therefore, reduced the production
cost while lowering the fermentation process and additives.
Also, the addition of vitamin B 12 maintained the activity of
glycerol dehydratase in the metabolic pathway. Glucose is
also added as an adjuvant to convert the biomass energy
and glycerol produced by glucose catabolism into poly(3HP)
production, thereby increasing yield. The synthesis method
only uses aerobic fermentation to produce a poly(3HP) yield
of 21.8 g/L, accounting for 46.4% of the cell dry weight
(Table 2 and Figure 1 ; Wang et al., 2013). Although the
glycerol synthesis of poly(3HP) has made signiﬁcant progress,
there are still some unresolved challenges. For instance, the
addition of vitamin B 12 leads to an increase in the cost of
fermentation, which can be reduced by using K. pneumonia
strain, which produces vitamin B 12 as the host strain for
poly(3HP) synthesis.
Again, the redox balance problem in fermentation production
also plaques the poly(3HP) synthesis, which may be omitted
by introducing an anabolic pathway that overcomes NADH
(Andreeﬂen et al., 2014a). Another alternative to vitamin B 12
was Shimwellia blattae , a natural producer of vitamin B 12,
as a vector. The vector was engineered to express a 1,3-
propanediol (PDO) dehydrogenase gene (dhaTPp) and aldehyde
dehydrogenase (aldDPp) of Pseudomonas putida (Heinrich et al.,
2013). The aldDPp, Clostridium propionicum X2 propionate
coenzyme A transferase gene ( pctCp), and R. eutropha H16
phaC1Re (Figure 1 ) can produce a high yield of poly(3HP) in
the absence of vitamin B 12. However, contrary to the two-phase
fermentation method described in some research studies, the
fermentation process uses anaerobic-aerobic two-stage culture,
which not only achieves higher cell dry weight than complete
anaerobic production but also reduces the conversion of the
precursor 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to 1,3-PDO during the
aerobic phase (Andreeﬂen et al., 2010). Our previous studies
investigated the inﬂuence of diﬀerent oxygen supply patterns
on poly(PHB) yield and bacterial community diversity using
domestic sewage sludge and produced a poly(PHB) yield of
64% in cell dry weight of sequential batch reactor (SBR1) and
53% in SBR2. Again, the poly(PHB) synthesis from activated
sludge and the eﬀect of chemical oxygen demand (COD)/N
ratio on poly(PHB) accumulating ability in an anaerobic/aerobic
cycle SBR was also investigated. Poly(PHB) produced reached
a maximum of 64.2% of cell dry weight when COD was
1,200 mg/L, and COD/N/P was 1,200/9.6/30, respectively
(Liu et al., 2013, 2016b).

Another exciting outcome is the increase in cell dry weight
during fermentation with crude glycerol, which can also be
associated with the organic matter in the crude glycerol carbon
source can be utilized as a supplemental carbon source by
microorganisms, resulting in higher biomass than pure glycerol
fermentation (Andreeﬂen et al., 2014b). The ﬁnal results showed
that in the 2 L fed-batch fermentation reactor, poly(3HP)
accumulation accounted for 9.8 ± 0.4% of the cell dry weight
after 72 h of culture ( Table 2 ; Heinrich et al., 2013). The
introduction of the propionyl-CoA synthetase gene prpEEc
of E. coli into the K. pneumonia strain ( Figure 1 ) resulted
in aeration conditions that play a crucial role in poly(3HP)
production and cell growth. Among the engineered metabolic
pathways studied by Feng et al. (2015), 3-HP was used as a
poly(3HP) precursor. However, poly(3HP) production accounted
for only 10% of 3-HP production under three aeration conditions
with diﬀerent shaking culture rates of 50, 100, and 200 r/min
(Feng et al., 2015).
Finally, under the condition of no vitamin B 12 and
optimized aeration, poly(3HP) content accounted for 12.7%
of the cell dry weight after 48 h of culture. It is speculated
that the low conversion eﬃciency of poly(3HP) from 3-HP
is probably due to the low enzyme activity of propionyl-
CoA synthetase ( PrpE), and a similar phenomenon was also
found when constructing the R. eutropha expression vector
(Fukui et al., 2009).

Aduhene et al. Poly (3-hydroxypropionate) Biosynthesis Pathways and Properties
On the other hand, PrpE is a crucial enzyme for propionyl-
CoA catalytic synthesis in propionate catabolism. Compared
to propionate, 3-HP may not be suitable as a PrpE synthetic
substrate. Improvement of poly(3HP) production can be
achieved by modifying PrpE or using other PrpE sources such as
S. typhimurium (Lee et al., 2005). Generally, there is a balance
between molecular weight and PHA polymers yield (Lim et al.,
2011). The molecular weight and yield of PHA polymers are
generally determined by the ratio of the three key enzymes that
synthesize PHA, namely the phaC-encoded PHA synthase, the
phaA-encoded β-ketothiolase, and the phaB-encoded NADPH-
dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. Thus, the expression levels
of these three genes may lead to diﬀerences in PHA synthesis
yield. It is well known that for genes downstream of the
operon, genes close to the promoter will be highly expressed
(Sim et al., 2001).
Furthermore, researchers explored the eﬀect of the phaCAc
operon gene sequence on the targeted gene’s transcription
eﬃciency in the engineered E. coli (Hiroe et al., 2012). It
was evidenced that the speciﬁc location and the sequencing
of the nucleic acid sequence in the operon constitute
an eﬀective method for regulating gene expression. For
example, changing the promoter or adjusting the inducer
concentration can eﬀectively control the yield and the molecular
weight of the synthetic PHA polymer synthesized by the
recombinant strain. On this account, Andreeﬂen et al., 2014a)
rearranged the phaCAc operon gene sequence to optimize
the poly(3HP) synthesis operon structure by engineering a
carbon-dependent plasmid in a triosephosphate isomerase
knockout mutant.
The plasmid addition system overcomes the problem of
plasmid loss during fermentation, thereby increasing the yield
of the polymer from 52 ± 3.3 to 57 ± 1.6% (wtPHA/wtCDW)
in recombinant E. coli (Table 2 ; Zhou et al., 2011). The
metabolic pathway synthesis of poly(3HP) yields nearly a two-
fold increase while at the same time obtaining high value-added
by-products. To stabilize poly(3HP) production, Gao et al. (2014)
constructed a genetically stable recombinant strain of E. coli .
Based on amino acid synthesis and metabolism, chromosomal
gene integration and plasmid addiction system technology were
used to obtain high-yield poly(3HP) engineering strain E. coli
Q1738 (Gao et al., 2014).
Under aerobic conditions, the recombinant strain yielded
25.7g/L poly(3HP) by glycerol fermentation, and the cell
accumulation was as high as 67.9% ( Table 2; Andreeﬂen et al.,
2014b; Gao et al., 2014). This study shows that if two or more
types of plasmids are present in the same strain, plasmid stability
will be reduced, resulting in a low yield of poly(3HP). It has
been reported that in the stability test of the veriﬁed plasmid,
the stability decrease as the length of the plasmid increases,
and the metabolic load caused by the rise in the number of
plasmid repeats is the leading cause of plasmid loss. The multiplex
plasmid has a substantial metabolic burden on the cells, and the
single plasmid is more reasonable and stable. Furthermore, the
toxic eﬀects of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde produced by glycerol
dehydratase conversion in the glycerol pathway are also reasons
for reducing poly(3HP) production.
Malonyl-CoA Pathway
The Malonyl-CoA route is the de novo synthesis of fatty
acids. This pathway has no restrictions on the use of various
carbon sources. The substrate can be metabolized by cells to
produce acetyl-CoA, thereby further creating the intermediate
product Malonyl-CoA. The goal of synthesizing the ﬁnal product
poly(3HP) can be achieved, which is the preferred route for the
low-cost synthesis of poly(3HP) (Wang et al., 2013).
The pathway shows how acetyl-CoA is converted into
Malonyl-CoA by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene ( acc).
A Malonyl-CoA reductase gene ( mcrCa) of Chloroﬂexus
aurantiacus was then introduced to synthesize 3-HP. The
propionyl-CoA synthetase gene ( pcsCa) was then transferred
into R. eutropha to synthesize poly(3HP) (Fukui et al.,
2009). This study successfully established a new artiﬁcial
pathway using a cheap carbon source to synthesize poly(3HP)
(Figure 1 ). In the Malonyl-CoA route, the acc genes were
overexpressed to increase the intracellular Malonyl-CoA
concentration and simultaneously transferred propionyl-
CoA into E. col to increase Poly(3HP) accumulation. The
synthetase gene ( prpEEc) replaces the pcsCa gene and
reconstitutes the poly(3HP) synthesis pathway in E. coli .
The recombinant E. coli synthesizes poly(3HP) with glucose
as the carbon source yielding 13 mg/L, accounting for
0.98% of the cell dry weight ( Table 2 ; Wang et al., 2012;
Andreeﬂen et al., 2014b).
In the Malonyl-CoA pathway, when the poly(3HP) synthesis
was carried out in E. coli with a transparent genetic background
and cultured, the non-structural-related carbon source could be
utilized, but its yield was signiﬁcantly too low and might be
caused by plasmid loss (Wang et al., 2014).
Firstly, the plasmid-selective marker gene containing
antibiotic resistance in the recombinant strain is secreted in
the medium, which may cause rapid decomposition of the
corresponding antibiotic and excessive growth of plasmid-
free cells. Secondly, the malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) of
C. aurantiacus catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP.
It is a critical enzyme in poly(3HP) microbial production, while
MCR’s toxic eﬀect of the intermediate malonate semialdehyde
and the host cell E. coli . Thirdly, MCR’s low activity is also
one reason for the low poly(3HP) content. MCR enzyme from
phototrophic C.aurantiacus is the focal enzyme in microbial
production with an optimal enzyme reaction temperature
of 57 ◦C (Hügler et al., 2002), which is higher than the
optimal growth temperature of the carrier E. coli and the
culture medium, which is 37 ◦C. Under this condition, MCR
enzyme activity can only reach 60% of the full process, so
the culture temperature becomes a factor that restricts MCR’s
operation. Moreover, MCR enzymatic process in E. coli is tightly
controlled by its physiological and environmental characteristics,
which may be aﬀected when any of these factors change
(Hügler et al., 2002).
A detailed analysis of the MCR functional domain was
investigated to solve the low catalytic activity of MCR in
the Malonyl-CoA pathway. The MCR enzymatic activity has
two active centers. Namely, Malonyl-CoA reductase N-terminal
(MCR-N) (amino acids 1–549) and Malonyl-CoA reductase

C-terminal (MCR-C) (amino acids 550–1,219). These two
centers catalyze the synthesis of malonyl CoA 3-HP in two
steps; MCR-C catalyzes the malonyl CoA reduction to the
free intermediate malonic acid semialdehyde, catalyzed 3-
HP by MCR-N ( Figure 1 ). The activity of key enzymes
in the Malonyl-CoA pathway was analyzed by Liu et al.
(2016a), and it was found that the MCR-C process was
4–5 times lower than MCR-N; that is, the imbalance of
MCR enzyme activity restricted the eﬃcient accumulation
of downstream products. Targeted mutagenesis of MCR-C
and MCR-N was carried out to regulate their expression
rate, and the fermentation conditions were optimized. The
yield of poly(3HP) precursor 3-HP was up to 40.6 g/L
(Liu et al., 2016a).
Several studies have assessed the accumulation of polyketides
in the 3-HP pathway by dynamic regulation Malonyl-CoA
system. When the intracellular supply of Malonyl-CoA was
suﬃcient, downstream products’ synthesis capacity increased
by 100 times (Yuzawa et al., 2012). Furthermore, Zhang et al.
(2012) proposed designing a dynamic regulation system for
Malonyl-CoA to improve the synthesis and conversion rate of
Malonyl-CoA, thereby increasing the yield of the ﬁnal product
(Zhang et al., 2012).
Modiﬁed Pathway
The modiﬁed or the current route for the biosynthesis of
poly(3HP) was developed, employing β-alanine as intermediate,
thereby named the β-alanine pathway.
B-Alanine Pathway
Poly (3-HP) accumulation can be higher in the PduP route, but
maintaining glycerol dehydratase activity requires an exogenous
supply of vitamin B 12, resulting in increased production costs.
Furthermore, in the Malonyl-CoA pathway, when glucose was
used as a sole carbon source, only 13 mg/L poly(3HP) was
accumulated by the E. coli (Wang et al., 2012). The biosynthesis
of poly(3HP) from glucose as the only carbon source has been
reported to give a lower yield, and to produce commercially on
a large scale is not feasible. Hence, a new way to synthesize
poly(3HP) from β-alanine as an intermediate in the recombinant
E. coli to mitigate these problems ( Figure 1; Wang et al., 2014).
Lacmata et al., 2017, after a series of system optimization,
was able to cloned and ampliﬁed these genes simultaneously;
panDEc from E. coli, with its mature factor panMEc, 3-
hydroxy acid dehydrogenase gene ( ydfG), and propionyl-CoA
synthetase gene ( prpEEc) (Lacmata et al., 2017). P. putida ’s
β-alanine-pyruvate transaminase gene ( pp0596) and phaC1Re
were expressed in E. coli. Using glycerol and glucose as carbon
sources, the poly(3HP) content in the recombinant strain was
0.5 g/L, which was 10.2% of the cell dry weight ( Table 2 ;
Wang et al., 2014). Although the poly(3HP) content was low,
the advantage of this pathway over other reported routes is
redox neutrality, the non-addition of coenzymes and expensive
precursors, and the use of a wide range of carbon sources.
The above advantages are also worthy of further research and
development by researchers.

A new strategy utilized β-alanine as an intermediate was
constructed (Wang et al., 2014). It was observed that the
L-aspartate produced from the aspartic acid biosynthesis
pathway was converted into β-alanine utilizing L-aspartate
-α-decarboxylase (PanD) of E. coli. The β-alanine was
further converted into malonate semialdehyde by β-alanine-
pyruvate transaminase of P.putida. Furthermore, the malonate
semialdehyde was reduced by YdfG from E. coli to 3-HP as
a precursor to poly(3HP) (Lacmata et al., 2017; Figure 1 ).
The experimental process found that insuﬃcient supply of
β-alanine restricted the biosynthesis of poly(3HP), possibly due
to low L-aspartate- α-decarboxylase activity or low intracellular
L-aspartate concentration L-aspartate- α-decarboxylase is
the rate-limiting enzyme in the β-alanine pathway and is
transferred to PanD of E. coli or glutamate rod Corynebacterium
glutamicum. The enzyme increases the synthesis eﬃciency
to produce a suﬃcient amount of beta-alanine. However, the
experimental results showed that the increase in L-aspartic acid
concentration is not adequate for the conversion of β-alanine.
The ﬁnal experiment showed that recombinant E. coli under
suitable conditions synthesized 10.2 g/L and 39.1% (wt/wt [cell
dry weight] of poly(3HP), respectively, without the addition
of vitamin B 12 in ﬂask culture and fed-batch fermentation,
respectively (Table 2; Lacmata et al., 2017).
THE PRODUCTION HOST OF POLY(3HP)
Some microorganisms are to produce poly(3HP) by engineering
microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, as shown in Table 3
(Jers et al., 2019). Choosing the appropriate host to use
involves several factors. The microbes must have the ability to
tolerate organic acids as well as potentially toxic impurities in
carbon sources. As one of the broadly used substrates, glycerol
dehydratase is coenzyme B 12-dependent; the production host
should preferentially synthesize coenzyme B12.

biofuels, chemicals, polymers, and proteins, and the production
procedures often depend on the expression of diﬀerent genes
carried by plasmid vectors (Kroll et al., 2010). It has been
broadly used as chassis for the production of poly(3HP). In
2010, a recombinant E. coli strain was used as a host bacteria
to produced 1.42 g/L poly(3HP) in the fed-batch fermentation.
The process employed crude glycerol as the substrate by
introducing the glycerol dehydratase of C.butyricum, PduP of
S.entarica serovar Typhimurium LT2, and PhaC1 of R.eutropha
into the E. coli (Andreeﬂen et al., 2010). A new strategy
was developed that accumulated poly(3HP) using glycerol as a
substrate by employing glycerol dehydratase of K. pneumonia ,
which is functional along with its reactivate GdrABL under
both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and has been used in
the production of 1,3-PDO and 3-HP (Huang et al., 2012).
Furthermore, a recombinant strain of E. coli under optimal
conditions accumulated the highest CDW of 21.8 g/L containing
46.4% of poly(3HP) without any expensive precursor during
aerobic fed-batch fermentation (Wang et al., 2013).
Klebsiella pneumonia
It is a pathogenic bacteria sparingly used in poly (3-HP)
production compared to engineered E. coli strains because of
the low accumulation of poly (3-HP). Engineered K. pneumonia
can naturally produce vitamin B12, making it economically
advantageous compared to E. coli , which lacks the coenzyme
vitamin B 12 (Ashok et al., 2013). Under controlled aeration,
engineered strain Q61643 accumulated 0.24 g/L of poly(3HP),
which accounted for 12.7% of the cell dry weight (Feng
et al., 2015). Again, using the vitamin B 12 dependent glycerol
dehydratase from K. pneumonia, which is less sensitive to oxygen,
a higher poly(3HP) was achieved, accumulating 46.4% of the cell
dry weight (Wang et al., 2013).
The strategy employed by Wang et al. (2013) was improved
by combining chromosomal gene integration (genes involved in
glycerol dehydration) and plasmid addiction system (synthase
and CoA acylating enzyme genes) based on tyrosine anabolism,
and the resulting K.pneumonia strain accumulated 67.9% of
poly(3HP) the cell dry weight (Gao et al., 2014).
Furthermore, a metabolically engineered strain of
K. pnuemonia is used to produce 0.24 g/L Poly(3HP) from
glucose, which accounted for 12.7% of cell dry weight without
the external addition of the coenzyme vitamin B 12 under
controlled dissolved oxygen (100rmp, 100mL working volume in
250 mL non-baﬄed ﬂasks) (Feng et al., 2015).
Shimwellia blattae
A member of the Enterobacteriaceae S. blattae , cobalamin
forming, non-pathogenic, previously isolated from the cockroach
Blattae orientalis genes DhaT and AldT of P.putida KT2442,
pct of Clostridium propionicum X2, and PhaC1Re enabled the
production of 0.26 g/L poly(3HP). The production of crude
glycerol from biodiesel as the substrate without the addition
of any co-factors such as vitamin B 12 because it produces 1,3-
PDO, a native coenzyme B 12 –dependent glycerol dehydratase
(Heinrich et al., 2013).
MALONYL-COA BIOSENSOR
APPLICATION IN IMPROVING POLY(3HP)
YIELD
The biosynthesis industry has applied synthetic biology and
metabolic engineering within the last decade by assembling
biotechnological components to optimize production titer, rate,
and microbial yield (Nielsen and Keasling, 2016; Yu et al., 2019).
In industrial biotechnology, enormous interest in exploring
intracellular Malonyl-CoA ﬂux for the biosynthesis of fatty
acids and non-fatty acid-based end chemicals in microbial cell
factories, such as E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae through
the role of Malonyl-CoA as a precursor metabolite as shown in
Figure 2 (Johnson, 2019). A reliable metabolic system with a ﬁne-
tuned gene expression can assist in achieving such optimization.
Such a built system aims to reduce the metabolic waste burden
and ﬂux imbalance, and toxic accumulation on the cell (Jones
et al., 2015). Alternatively, constructing a dynamic biosynthetic
pathway employing metabolite biosensors can increase yield (Tan
and Prather, 2017). A metabolite biosensor has been used in
improving the production of 3-HP (David et al., 2016) and
fatty acid ethyl esteriﬁcation (Zhang et al., 2012) to maximize
yields. Another study proved that over-expression of the acc
gene led to a signiﬁcant increase of poly(3HP) in a recombinant
Poly(3HP) producing E. coli due to the increased intracellular
pool of malonyl-CoA (Wang et al., 2012). Together, the studies
conﬁrmed that the overexpression ofacc genes could enhance the
cellular malonyl-CoA concentration.
The low intracellular concentration of Malonyl-CoA limits
the eﬃcient synthesis of downstream products. Eliminating
the bottleneck constraints of Malonyl-CoA is the prerequisite
basis for increasing the output of poly(3HP). It provides a
theoretical basis for industrializing diﬀerent products in low-
cost and large-scale pharmaceutical and chemical ﬁelds. Previous
research showed that low Malonyl-CoA production is the
key factor restricting the eﬃcient accumulation of poly(3HP).
A recombinant bacterial capable of accumulating high amounts
of poly(3HP) was developed.
The high or low concentration of Malonyl-CoA inhibits
bacterial growth, thereby restricting poly (3HP) synthesis.
Dynamic regulation of the synthesis and conversion rate of
Malonyl-CoA to solve bacterial cytotoxicity was considered.
Using wild-type bacteria can also regulate metabolism in real-
time according to changes in the intracellular, extracellular
environment. However, due to the lack of the necessary sensory
control system, the engineered bacteria constructed with foreign
genes cannot accurately control the metabolism according to
the host’s state and synthesize corresponding enzymes sparingly,
resulting in metabolic imbalance and resource waste. Therefore,
the introduction of sensory regulation systems in engineering
bacteria and the adjustment of metabolism according to the host
state have an essential role in improving product synthesis (Ding
et al., 2015; Mo et al., 2017).
Recently, the FapR protein domain has been predicted
(Albanesi et al., 2013; Albanesi and De Mendoza, 2016), and
the mechanism by which FapR regulates fatty acid synthesis

FIGURE 2 | Overview of some compounds derived from the microbial synthesis of Malonyl-CoA dependent molecules. Malonyl-CoA is a direct product of

has also been elucidated (Ellis and Wolfgang, 2012; Figure 3 ).
When the intracellular Malonyl-CoA concentration is low, FapR
binds to FapO on the promoter causing Steric hindrance. It
prevents RNA polymerase (RNA Pol.) from attaching to the
promoter, thereby inhibiting downstream gene transcription;
when Malonyl-CoA concentration is high, FapR forms a complex
with Malonyl-CoA and detaches from the promoter, allowing
the promoter space to allow RNA to polymerize. The enzyme
can combine with the promoter to start the transcription
of the fatty acid synthesis gene and then regulate the rate
of fatty acid synthesis according to the concentration of
intracellular Malonyl-CoA. FapR has the property of binding
to FapO through gel retardation experiments, and it has been
conﬁrmed that the concentration of Malonyl-CoA will aﬀect the
proportion of FapR and FapO binding. As the concentration
of Malonyl-CoA increases, the FapR that can bind to FapO
decreases signiﬁcantly.
Zhang’s research group used the natural FapR and FapO of
Bacillus subtilis to construct the Malonyl-CoA sensor (Zhang
et al., 2012) and used the sensor to regulate the artiﬁcially
constructed fatty acid synthesis pathway to increase fatty
acid production by 33–34% of the yield (Liu et al., 2015b).
After that, David (David et al., 2016) adjusted the position
and copy number of FapO in the promoter −35/−10 region
or −10 downstream to reduce the energy loss during the
synthesis of 3-HP by S. cerevisiae and increase the yield
of 3-HP by 10 times. Y ang et al. (2015) used antisense
RNA technology to suppress speciﬁc genes’ expression in the
fatty acid synthesis pathway. The intracellular Malonyl-CoA
concentration increased by 4.5 times, and the downstream
products of Malonyl-CoA, 4-hydroxycoumarin, resveratrol, and
naringenin. The output increased by 2.53, 1.70, and 1.53 times,
respectively. Because of the previous research ideas, the low
concentration of Malonyl-CoA restricts poly(3HP) synthesis, but
the concentration is too high to poison and kills the bacteria.
Intention to use the Malonyl-CoA sensor to simultaneously
regulate intracellular Malonyl-CoA concentration, solving cell
density and poly(3HP) production.
LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT FOR THE
PRODUCTION OF POLY(3HP) FROM
CORN OIL
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method designed to assess
a product’s impacts or processes on the environment (Rebitzer
et al., 2004). LCA is an architecture that can evaluate a product’s
environmental impacts throughout its life, starting from the
extraction of raw materials from growth and ending at the waste
products being disposed to the earth. Many researchers have

carried out LCA investigations on PHAs polymer’s biosynthesis
(Khoo et al., 2010; Heimersson et al., 2014). The LCA of
bioplastics has revealed that PHAs polymer’s production and
application are more environmentally friendly than synthetic
polymer in consideration of energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions (Ali and Jamil, 2016). The abundant availability of
corn in the world is used to produce corn oil, and the LCA to
produce poly(3HP) from corn oil has been shown in Figure 4.
The corn growing need corn seed, carbon dioxide, fertilizer,
water, electricity, and fuel (diesel, propane, and gasoline) used by
the farmer. The atmospheric carbon dioxide takes up through
the photosynthesis process, irrigation water, and pesticides.
Then harvest and transport of corn to the corn mill plant,
transesteriﬁcation of corn oil into crude glycerol, fermentation
and puriﬁcation of glycerol, and downstream of biopolymer
poly (3HP) to poly(3HP) (Trirahayu, 2020). On the output side,
emissions such as dinitrogen oxide, nitrates, and phosphates
were considered. Glycerol is widely used as a raw material to
manufacture various cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and packaging.
The production of glycerol can use corn oil through several
processes such as transesteriﬁcation, saponiﬁcation with NaOH,
and fat splitting (Marx, 2016). The production of biodiesel with
glycerol as a waste product is term as transesteriﬁcation, and the
raw material used in this process is corn oil.
PHYSICAL/MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF
POLY(3HP)
Poly(3HP) homopolymer is a well-known biodegradable,
thermoplastic polyester with high tensile strength, elongation
at breaking, and high moisture permeability. Poly(3HP)
possess a melting peak temperature of 79.1 oC in its pure
state and about 77.7 oC in blends with the Poly(3HP) content
ranging from 50–90%, a glass transition temperature of
−20, and a fusion enthalpy value of 64J/g, as shown in
Table 1 (Andreeﬂen et al., 2014b). Although poly(3HP) has
received focus to be environmentally degradable material, it
has some limitations due to brittleness (high crystallinity),
limited processability, and high hydrophobicity (Catiker
and Basan, 2017). Some studies have been conducted on
poly(3HP) blends to eliminate these abnormalities (He et al.,
2000). Similarly, various poly(3HP) copolymers have been
examined by blending their favorable material properties
with other components (Andreeﬂen and Steinbüchel, 2010;
Zhou et al., 2011).
Some polymer blends with poly (3-HP) are becoming
more critical and eﬃcient routes of developing new polymeric
material in the polymer industry. Various polymer blends have
been researched and further applied in some ﬁelds, such as

scaﬀold material in tissue engineering and polymeric matrix
for drug delivery.
Polymer blends and polymer thermal degradation of
poly (3-HP) have been investigated by applying one or
more of the following techniques such as thermogravimetry
(TGA), diﬀerential thermal analysis (DTA), dynamic
mechanical, thermal analysis (DMTA), diﬀerential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
(Catiker and Basan, 2017). The miscibility and thermal
degradation of [poly(3HP)] and poly- β-alanine (poly
(BA) have been studied thoroughly. Catiker and Basan
(2017) studied the miscibility of poly(3HP) and poly(BA)
and found out that blends of these two components
are miscible in the amorphous phase. The miscibility
occurred because of the suppression of the crystallinity of
both elements in the blends. The thermal degradation of
poly(3HP) and poly(BA) was examined, and the results have
shown that combinations of these components turned to
decompose thermally via fast and single-step degradation
(Catiker and Basan, 2017).
Furthermore, the miscibility of biodegradable blends of
high molecular weight poly (ethylene oxide) [poly (EO)] with
poly(3HP) and poly (3-hydroxybutyric acid) have also been
studied by He et al. (2000). However, binary blends of low
molecular weight of poly(EO) ( MV = 2.0 × 104gmol−1) with
poly(3HP) has been reported to be miscible according to some
experiments using DSC measurements.
IMPORTANCE MATERIALS OF
POLY(3HP)
Overall, various copolymers and block polymers have a more
extensive range of industry and medicine applications due to
their barrier properties and mechanical strength than other
bioplastics such as polylactic acid. Despite its intrinsic brittleness,
much progress has been made through the formulation of
poly(3HP) with tailored additives and blends, leading to
improved mechanical strength and suitable processability via
extrusion or injection molding (Torres-Martínez et al., 2019).
Medical Applications of Poly (3-HP)
Scaffold Material in Tissue Engineering
Recently, biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric scaﬀolds
have been applied in tissue regeneration functions. Cortizo
et al. (2008) experimented with developing a polymeric-
based scaﬀold for bone regeneration using two polyesters
(poly-β-propiolactone and poly- ε-caprolactone) and two
polyfumarates (polydiisopropyl fumarate and polydicyclohexyl
fumarate). Their studies showed that poly- β-propiolactone
(PBPL), currently known as poly(3HP), was found out to
support osteoblastic growth through adhesion. Growth and
diﬀerentiation of two osteoblastic cell lines (mouse calvaries-
derived MC3T3E1 cells and UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cells)

Under acellular conditions, poly (3-HP) was degraded by a
hydrolytic mechanism. Well-deﬁned actin ﬁbers of osteoblasts
were developed without any evidence of cytotoxicity when
growing on ﬁlms. It was observed that the number of UMR106
osteoblasts that adhered to poly (3-HP)-the based ﬁlm was higher
compared to cells attached to the two polyfumarates matrices.
Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the proliferation
of UMR106 cells on polyester-derived scaﬀolds (poly(3HP) and
Poly-ε-caprolactone) (Cortizo et al., 2008). Fix a general diagram

Polymeric Matrix for Drug Delivery
Poly(3HP) ﬁlm can be applied in drug delivery system requiring
a sustained and controlled delivery mechanism. An experiment
conducted by Cortizo et al. (2001) proved the release kinetics
of a complex of vanadium (IV) with aspirin (VOAspi) on ﬁlms
from polymers of diﬀerent molecular weights and as well as
with variable drug load. After 7 days, a sustained release of
vanadium on ﬁlms of other polymers, two contributing factors,
(a) diﬀusion of the drug, and (b) degradation of the poly(3HP)
ﬁlm, was postulated. Analyzing the experimental data of the
drug’s diﬀusion coeﬃcient (VOAspi) using a diﬀusion model,
VOAspi does not show strong interaction with poly (3-HP), and
UMR106 osteosarcoma cells show no anticarcinogenic eﬀects of
VOAspi releases from the ﬁlm.
Moreover, cell proliferation was inhibited by the VOApi-
poly(3HP) in a dose-response manner and induced half of
the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation (TBARS),
an index of lipid peroxidation, as compared to that with free
VOAspi in solution. There was no cytotoxicity generated by
the poly(3HP) ﬁlm as cell growth, and TBARS was evaluated.
The poly(3HP) ﬁlm- embedded with VOASpi retained an
antiproliferative eﬀect evidencing lower cytotoxicity than the free
drug (Cortizo et al., 2001).
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
As mentioned in this review, considering the case of recent
advances in poly(3HP) biosynthesis by researchers who have
established an active poly(3HP) biosynthetic pathway through
genetic engineering techniques; thus the Malonyl-CoA and
glycerol pathways have been modiﬁed to utilize an abundant
and inexpensive carbon source to improve the synthesis of
poly(3HP) to some appreciable production. In terms of the
eﬃciency of poly(3HP) synthesis, the new β-alanine pathway
is optimized to reduce the production costs, and it is now
the hotspot in poly(3HP) biosynthesis. Furthermore, in the
case of poly(3HP) production in microbial host chassis, there
are many factors to the generative design of an appropriate
production strain, ranging from the selection of the microbial
host, the pathway, and the enzymes to the genetic engineering
of the cell for improved process through the biosynthetic
pathway of production and the ability to accommodate/tolerate
metabolic stress facilitated by intermediate, and the ﬁnal
products ( Figure 1 ). Most of the studies described in the
review have targeted the highest titers recorded so far by
these cell factories, of which a recombinant strain of E. coli
under optimal conditions accumulated the highest CDW of
21.8 g/L containing 46.4% of poly(3HP) without the addition
of any expensive precursor in an aerobic fed-batch fermentation
(Wang et al., 2013).
The impressive body of the research on biosynthetic pathways
construction has identiﬁed numerous challenges such as (a)
addition of important coenzymes and poly(3HP) structures
similar to precursors to increase production costs, (b) the
loss of plasmids in genetically engineered strains result in
lower titers in the ﬁnal product of poly(3HP), and (c) in the
poly(3HP) biosynthetic pathway, the of related intermediates
is too high, which causes cytotoxicity. These challenges are
yet to be resolved, and with the development of gene editing
and expression modiﬁcation technologies, has been gradually
applied in the biochemical industry; as reported by Gao et al.
(2014), the use of genomic integration technology has eﬀectively
increased the titer of poly(3HP) in the glycerol and Malonyl-
CoA pathways, respectively (Gao et al., 2014). Also, the negative
feedback regulation mechanism of biosensor developed by Zhang
et al. (2012), the key to MCR enzyme activity control factor,
and design a negative feedback regulatory pathway to regulate
the enzyme activity and cell proliferation ability of MCR at
a higher level (Zhang et al., 2012). Again, the use of gene
knockout to reduce the production of metabolites unrelated to
the ﬁnal product.
Finally, more powerful and advanced engineering
techniques/tools are continually being developed; notably,
the recent developments of 3-HP and Malonyl-CoA biosensors
can be used in combination with adaptive laboratory evolution
for identifying as-of-yet unknown mechanism for further
ﬁne-tuning of production strains.
In conclusion, the advanced development of synthetic
biology and metabolic engineering should be geared toward
designing large combinatorial cell factory libraries using
only renewable and inexpensive carbon sources, thereby
promoting the industrialization of economic large scale
production of poly(3HP).
