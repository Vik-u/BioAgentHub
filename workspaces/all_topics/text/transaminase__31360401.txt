Directed evolution of transaminases is a widespread technique in the development of highly sought-after
biocatalysts for industrial applications. This process, however, is challenged by the limited availability of
eﬀective high-throughput protocols to evaluate mutant libraries. Here we report a rapid, reliable, and
widely applicable background depletion method for solid-phase screening of transaminase variants,
which was successfully applied to a transaminase fromHalomonas elongata (HEWT), evolved through
rounds of random mutagenesis towards a series of diverse prochiral ketones. This approach enabled the
identiﬁcation of transaminase variants in viable cells with signiﬁcantly improved activity towards para-
substituted acetophenones (up to 60-fold), as well as tetrahydrothiophen-3-one and related substrates.
Rationalisation of the mutants was assisted by determination of the high-resolution wild-type HEWT
crystal structure presented herein.
Introduction
Transaminases have attracted considerable attention for the
production of compounds containing chiral amino groups,
which are widespread in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and
ne chemical industry.
1,2 Of particular interest, in terms of
synthetic applications, are the amine transaminases (ATAs), (R)-
or (S)-selective enzymes that are capable of aminating carbonyls
(both aldehydes and ketones) in the absence of a neighbouring
carboxylic group.
3 Despite the enormous potential of ATAs, the
widespread application of these biocatalysts in their wild type
form is hindered by a number of challenges including limited
substrate specicities, substrate and product inhibition, and
unfavourable reaction equilibria.
4
Protein engineering by rational design 5–7 and directed
evolution8,9 have played a major role in the ability to address
these issues. Evolutionary strategies, in particular, are ideally
suited to the optimisation of the physical properties of enzymes
for large-scale manufacturing processes, as well as enabling
ne-tuning of substrate and stereochemical preferences.
10,11
The evolution of ATAs by Codexis and Merck12,13 pioneered
subsequent engineering eﬀorts of many ATAs, resulting in the
production of an array of highly specialised ATAs for chiral
amine synthesis.8,9,14
Even though a fully randomised approach to mutagenesis,
targeting the whole length of the protein, has become less
common, directed evolution clearly requires high-throughput
screening methods to evaluate variable size libraries of engi-
neered variants. The generation of smaller, smart libraries
designed by rational targeted approaches such as CASTing,
15 or
saturation mutagenesis of specic residues identied in silico,
still yield a sizable number of clones to screen (saturation at
three positions aﬀords 8000 variants). The identication of hits
within live cells is advantageous for library screening because, if
it is eﬃcient, it prevents culturing of large number of clones
followed by assays with cell extracts, which, in the absence of
robotics, is very time-consuming.
16 Recently, micro uidic
screening,17,18 in addition to the application of desorption
electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry19 on whole colonies,
have emerged as powerful tools for screening large libraries,
however, the equipment required in both cases is still highly
specialised and expensive, therefore they are not yet suitable for
widespread implementation. Solid-phase screening (SPS), on
the other hand, is a simpler approach that facilitates the
screening of a medium-large number of mutant variants based
on colorimetric changes that are easily observed by the naked
eye.
20 SPS was successfully applied in the evolution of mono-
amine oxidase (MAO-N) enzymes, using two libraries that were
fully saturated at two positions each (400 variants). 21 SPS
methods applicable to ATA mutant libraries, however, are
currently limited to a few strategies to screen for amino donors.

Wu and co-workers, for example, reported the use of SPS to
screen libraries of approximately 100 000 ATA variants for
reduced inhibition towards methoxyisopropylamine. 22 Later,
Bornscheuer and colleagues applied SPS to evolve an ATA
towards suitable amino donors (screeningca. 4600 colonies),
however this required co-expression of a second enzyme as
a coupled reporting system, increasing the complexity of the
system.
23,24 Similarly, Turner and co-workers evolved SPS for
ATA library screening, specically to identify either (R)- or (S)-
selective ATAs (screening ca. 1000 colonies), which also
required multiple reporting enzymes, as well asash-freezing in
liquid nitrogen, to increase permeability.25
Screening strategies for varying carbonyl acceptors, which
are key substrates for ATAs to produce chiral amine products,
appear to be much more challenging.ortho-Xylylenediamine
26
and 4-nitrophenethylamine27 have been recently reported as
amine donors in proof of concept studies to rapidly generate
coloured by-products upon transamination. Both these strate-
gies suﬀer from strong background interference in live cells due
to endogenous pyruvate which is nearly always an excellent
substrate for ATAs; in a mutant library screening, the number of
false positives is certain to be signicant without an eﬃcient
system to deplete background. Pyruvate is a primary metabolite,
essential for cell growth, therefore knock-out strategies are not
feasible, making it inherently diﬃcult to minimise the back-
ground noise in SPS.
We here report the development of a simple and reliable SPS
method that encapsulates (S)-1-phenylethylamine as a straight-
forward background depletion agent to minimize high levels of
pyruvate activity. To highlight the power of this methodology,
we successfully applied it to the screening of a fully randomised
mutant library of an (S)-selective ATA fromHalomonas elongata
(HEWT)
28 against a series of prochiral aromatic and cyclic
ketones. In addition, the crystal structure of the wild-type
HEWT is reported, which facilitated rationalisation of the
mutations introduced.
Results and discussion
Depletion of background activity and test screening
Reliable methodology to quench background activity, which
leads to a high number of false positives, was designed to
specically deplete endogenous pyruvate. Unlike previously
discussed methods, our alternative approach is based on pre-
reacting cellular pyruvate with ( S)-1-phenylethylamine. The
reaction is catalysed by the expressed transaminase to produce
alanine and acetophenone with an extremely favourable equi-
librium, eﬀectively removing pyruvate as a non-specic acceptor
from the environment. The screening was initially optimised
with E. coliBL21(DE3) cells expressing wild-type HEWT, which
were spread onto a nitrocellulose membrane deposited on a LB-
agar plate. This permitted easy transfer of the colonies through
the diﬀerent assay steps (Fig. S1†). Following expression and
dialysis (Experimental in the ESI†), the membrane was le for
30 minutes onlter paper soaked with (S)-1-phenylethylamine
and then washed with 50 mM phosphate buﬀer, pH 8.
Test screening of pre-treated colonies to establish timelines
and reaction eﬃciency, were performed with both pyruvate and
acetophenone and compared with a control plate not supple-
mented with any amino acceptor (Fig. S2†). ortho-Xylylenedi-
amine was used in therst instance as an amino donor. The
control plate did not give any colorimetric change up to two
hours, aer which time a slightly brown tinge could be observed
likely due to the cell healthy metabolic system producing
suﬃcient amounts of pyruvate detectable through the reaction.
In the absence of the background depletion step, the cells
almost immediately respond to the amino donor preventing any
signicant discrimination between exogenous amino acceptor
and the endogenous pyruvate (Fig. 1), as was also observed by
O'Reilly and co-workers.
26 Likewise, the addition of pyruvate to
the membrane as the amino acceptor, causes visible darkening
of the colonies within 5 minutes of incubation. Acetophenone,
which in liquid-phase assays had shown no detectable activity
over 3 h with wild-tpe HEWT, performs similarly to the control
plate, with no observable colour formation during total incu-
bation (Fig. S2†). The mild treatment, preserved cell viability,
which is essential for the direct growth and plasmid extraction,
bypassing the need for a replica plate. To further evaluate the
eﬀectiveness of this strategy, 4-nitrophenethylamine was used
as amino donor in the assay.
27 Remarkably, a signi cant
reduction in background noise was observed once more, high-
lighting the transferability of this methodology (shouldo-xyly-
lenediamine not be accepted by the investigated TA). Indeed,
the background was even further suppressed when compared to
the ortho-xylylenediamine screen, with barely detectable dark-
ening of the colonies aer 24 h (Fig. S3†). Liquid nitrogen- and
chloroform-induced permeabilization steps were attempted
also,
24,25 but in our case neither method was successful.
The use of amines other than (S)-1-phenylethylamine, such
as isopropylamine and cadaverine, for the background deple-
tion step was also investigated. Cadaverine, previously
described as a “smart” amine donor,
29 can be used in ATA
reactions ex vivoand may eﬀectively convert endogenous pyru-
vate in whole cells. Isopropylamine is a very inexpensive amine
donor, commonly used in industrial processes;
12 the generated
acetone is produced in minimal quantities and expected to be
harmless to colonies. While both amines also resulted in

a signicant reduction in background (Fig. S4†), (S)-1-phenyl-
ethylamine appeared to be most eﬀective, possibly due to better
diﬀusion of this substrate. However, this demonstrates that
other amines can also be used to quench endogenous pyruvate,
for example with aminotransferases that do not accept 1-
phenylethylamine as a substrate.
Evolution towards substituted acetophenones
To test the methodology, HEWT was subjected to directed
evolution using error-prone PCR to generate a completely
randomised mutant library with a high number of mutations.
The enzyme has minimal activity towards the aromatic
substrate para-nitroacetophenone (1a) and this was selected as
the amino acceptor for the initial screening, usingortho-xyly-
lenediamine as the amino donor. DMSO (10% (v/v)) was
required for substrate solubility and enhanced cell-
permeability. The discrimination between wild-type and an
improved variant relies on the rapidity with which the enzyme
converts the substratein vivo. Screening ofca. 15 000 colonies
provided two variants with enhanced catalytic activity towards
para-nitroacetophenone. The two new variants (referred to as A1
and B1) were expressed and puri ed for further character-
isation. They exhibited a 2-fold increase in turnover frequency
with respect to the wild-type, achieved higher conversion aer 2
hours, and maintained excellent enantioselectivity (Table 1).
Both variants were subjected to a second round of error-prone
PCR and the libraries screened as before with 1a. Interest-
ingly, in this case the positive colonies were isolated a er
a signi cantly shorter incubation period (2 –15 minutes
compared to 25 minutes for the parental colony). While the A1
template did not provide any signicant hits, an improved
variant was isolated from the B1 library. The new mutant,
identied as B2, aﬀorded comparable molar conversion aer 2
hours and a further 1.5-fold increase in turn-over frequency
(Table 1). The e.e. measured at 24 h was in all cases >99%
(though the overall yields were low due to experimental condi-
tions needed to assess the kinetic behaviour of the mutants). A
third round of mutagenesis, using the B2 variant as a template,
initially failed to identify better variants, as the colour change
on solid screening was too rapid and did not allow discrimi-
nation between parental activity and mutants. Reducing the
concentration of para-nitroacetophenone and ortho-xylylenedi-
amine from 10 mM to 1 mM, with just 5% (v/v) DMSO prolonged
the screening window toca. 1 h. An additional variant, B3, was
isolated from the screening and while, upon purication, it
displayed comparable reaction velocity and 2 h conversions to
B2, it had 2-fold higher expression levels which justies a more
rapid colour development with respect to the parental variant.
Each variant was also fully characterised in terms of activity and
stability at diﬀerent temperatures and pHs. In all the cases, the
mutants generated did not show signicant alterations when
compared to the WT enzyme (Fig. S5–S8†).
A second substrate,para-cyanoacetophenone (2a), was also
investigated. HEWT wild-type has negligible activity towards
this molecule, even lower than the nitro substitution, with
a turnover frequency of 4/C2 10
/C0 3 s/C0 1. The B2 variant showed an
impressive 60-fold increase in turn-over frequency (229/C2 10/C0 3
s/C0 1), and enhanced stereoselectivity, aﬀording >99% of the (S)-
enantiomer (Table 1). Again, B3 showed virtually identical
catalytic properties to B2.

Evolution towards small cyclic ketones
To further expand the catalytic scope of HEWT, the original
mutant library was screened towards a structurally diﬀerent
substrate, tetrahydrothiophen-3-one (3a), a small cyclic ketone
which if successfully aminated yields a chiral amine (3b) that
has potential use as a building block for active pharmaceutical
ingredients.
30
In this case, the wild-type enzyme already possesses some
activity towards the target substrate ( 3a), with a turnover
frequency of 206 /C2 10/C0 3 s/C0 1 and complete molar conversion
(>99%) aer 24 h using equimolar amounts of (S)-1-phenyl-
ethylamine as donor and higher catalyst concentration (1 mg
mL
/C0 1 – 19 mM). The optimised solid phase screening withortho-
xylylenediamine yielded a new variant (C1) which, upon
expression and puri cation, displayed a 2-fold increase in
turnover frequency (Table 2). On this occasion, the mutant
showed a colour change aer 18 minutes, compared to 30
minutes for the wild-type control. Notably, the variant matched
the excellent conversion displayed by the wild-type enzyme,
aﬀording the (S)-enantiomer of the corresponding amine with
>99% conversion and 66% e.e.
The C1 variant was subsequently screened against a panel of
representative cyclic ketones (Table 2,4a, 5a, 6a). The mutant
had improved TOF with both tetrahydrofuan-3-one (4a)a n d
1-methylpiperidin-3-one (6a) (35% and 90% increase, respectively)
but it was in fact slower with 1-methylpyrrolidin-3-one (5a)( s e e
Table S1†). Similarly to what was observed with the library evolved
towards para-nitroacetophenone, an additional round of muta-
genesis did not permit the identication of better variants towards
tetrahydrothiophen-3-one (3a) as the colour change on the plates
was too rapid to discriminate further enhanced variants.
This clearly demonstrates that this solid phase screen is able
to identify better variants, both in terms of TOFs and expression
levels, from libraries that are of desirable size for semi-rational
approaches to directed evolution.
10 The application of this
methodology was successful even with a fully randomised
approach which can only aﬀord limited improvements of the
mutants, given the size of the library, due to the high probability
of unsuitable mutations.

3D structural analysis of wild type HEWT and mutant variants
In order to understand the eﬀect of the various mutations on
wild-type HEWT, the crystal structure was determined at
Table 2 HEWT evolution toward small cyclic ketones. Turnover frequencies (TOF) measured at 10 mM carbonyl concentration, molar
conversions (m.c.), and enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for wild-type HEWT and isolated variants towards tetrahydrothiophen-3-one (3a) tetrahy-
drofuran-3-one (4a), 1-methylpyrrolidin-3-one (5a) and 1-methyl-piperidin-3-one (6a). Final conversion was obtained within 2 hours of

a resolution of 2˚A, as described in the methods. Atomic coor-
dinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) under PDB accession code 6GWI.
Two identical HEWT monomers (chains A and B; RMSD 0.23
˚A) were present in the asymmetric unit (Matthews coeﬃcient ¼
2.14 ˚A3 Da/C0 1), with an estimated solvent content of 42.5% (see
Table S2†). This homodimer arrangement is biologically rele-
vant as HEWT is a catalytically active dimer. Electron density
was present for residues 2 to 451 (chain A) and 1 to 450 (chain
B). The HEWT monomer comprises 3 sub-domains: (i) a prin-
ciple PLP-dependent transferase-like domain (residues 82 to
318) that hosts a central mixedb-sheet, comprising 7 strands,
(b9–b8–b10–b11–b12–b13–b7), with b-strand 13 being antipar-
allel to the rest, surrounded by 9a-helices and two 3
10 helices
(h1–2) (Fig. 2); (ii) domain 2 (residues 2–79; 320–451) that
contains a small N-terminal sub-domain (residues 2 to 32;a1–
b1–b2–a2–b3–5) which forms the main interactions with the
opposing monomer. One molecule of pyridoxal-50-phosphate
(PLP), produced by the covalent attachment to the 3-amino
group of the catalytic lysine (K284),via an aldimine linkage, is
bound to each monomer. Dimerisation involves 100 residues
contributed from each monomer, with an interface area of 5395
˚A2. The main dimerisation interactions include 4 salt bridges
and 47 hydrogen bonds, as calculated by PDBsum available
from the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk).
Based on a secondary structure-based homology search, the
DALI server identied the 4-aminobutyrate transaminase from
Pseudomonas as the top hit (PDB entry 5KR6
32) with a RMSD of
1.3 ˚A over 445/460 aligned main chain residues.33 Sequence and
structure conservation between HEWT and all other structures
deposited in the PDB was assessed using ENDscript 2.0 (http://
endscript.ibcp.fr).34 HEWT was compared with 124 structures
with sequence conservation >30%. As expected, the highest
conservation (sequence and structural) is located in the PLP-
dependent transferase-like domain and active site region
(Fig. 3A).
Sequencing of the selected mutants identied two amino
acid changes in the A1 variant, (W56C, V435A), while the B1
variant displayed three amino acid substitutions (W56C, L211V,
L306M) (notes in the ESI†). Interestingly, both mutants harbour
a tryptophan to cysteine change in position 56, which is located
in the active site. This residue has previously been identied as
a hotspot in in silico rational design studies.
7,35 In this case,
removing the large indole ring and replacing it with the smaller
cysteine side chain allows for easier substrate binding.
Furthermore, the thiol can promote hydrogen bonding with the

aromatic substituent and stabilise para-nitroacetophenone
(Fig. 3B and C). Accordingly, W56 is located in a highly struc-
turally conserved region (Fig. 3A), as is V435 (Fig. 3A). The
L306M mutation is peripheral and not conserved with regards
to sequence, and therefore less conserved than the A1 muta-
tions with regards to structure, and therefore is somewhat more
diﬃcult to rationalise. The L306M mutation introduces a longer
side chain that may form more stabilising hydrophobic inter-
actions with surrounding hydrophobic residues (M126, V302
and F313). From the structure, this hydrophobic cluster may in-
turn stabilise regions of the protein that mediate dimerisation
(Fig. S11†). In agreement with this hypothesis, thermal stability
analysis of the wild-type and mutant B2 indicates that the latter
is more stable (Fig. S12 †). The second round of evolution
introduced three additional mutations (V361A, Q388R, P453L)
in the B2 variant, which are also located outside of the active site
and all are exposed to the solvent; their side-chains do not make
any signi cant stabilising intramolecular interactions. B3
introduced mostly silent mutations, apart from a single A254V
mutation neighbouring the D255 residue, forming a hydrogen
bond with the pyridine-type nitrogen of the co-factor PLP.
On the other hand, structural analysis of the C1 variant
revealed a single mutation (D5E) positioned at the N-terminus
of the protein (Fig. 3A). Using the protein structure quasi-rigid
domain decomposition (PiSQRD) web server (http://
pisqrd.escience-lab.org),
37 the HEWT crystal structure (chain
A) was decomposed into four sub-domains that can behave as
independent units during conformational uctuations
(Fig. S13†). D5 is located in domain 4 (residues 2–34 and 41–46)
that adopts ana1-helix–loop–a2-helix structure. Based on these
observations, an aspartate to glutamate mutation may alter the
local protein dynamics that in-turn may cause alterations in the
topology of the active site and hence substrate specicity and
activity.
Conclusions
The introduction of an amine donor as a background depletion
agent, which exploits the expressed ATA to quench endogenous
pyruvate proved to be very eﬀective in delivering an eﬃcient
screening platform for aminotransferase directed evolution.
This high-throughput screening strategy was developed on the
basis of theortho-xylylenediamine assay described by O'Reilly
and co-workers,
26 which was a fundamental tool in the evolution
of HEWT towards a diverse set of aromatic and cyclic ketones.
Aer three rounds of directed evolution, a 2.5-fold increase in
activity was obtained for para-nitroacetophenone, while with
para-cyanoacetophenone the identied mutant exhibited a 60-
fold higher turnover frequency coupled with a substantial
improvement of the enantioselectivity with respect to the wild
type. Furthermore, the evolution towards tetrahydrothiophen-3-
one yielded a 2-fold increase in the overall catalytic eﬃciency.
This enzyme also showed improved catalytic properties when
screened against similarly challenging cyclic ketones. The
background depletion step is straightforward and reliable, and
can be applied to other screening methods where endogenous
pyruvate interferes with detection making the evolution of these
enzymes a much less challenging task. The use of 4-nitro-
phenethylamine as an alternative reporter, as well as alternative
amine donors for the depletion step, proved successful. The
limit of this screen is set by the power of discrimination
between the mutant and the parent enzyme; if the substrate
conversion is too fast, the colonies turn black rapidly, which
leads to false positives. Tuning the screening conditions to slow
the reaction can extend the screening window. In addition,
through modulation of the parental activity, by regulating the
expression levels (with the use of a promoter that allows for
stricter control),
38 this screening method could be a very
powerful tool in further rounds of evolution towards the iden-
tication of more and more active mutants.
