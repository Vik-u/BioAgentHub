Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate and the product of various natural
and synthetic one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways. While an efﬁcient con-
version of acetyl-CoA into other central metabolites, such as pyruvate, is
imperative for high biomass yields, available aerobic pathways typically

The Lcm module provides a direct link between acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, is
shorter than any other oxygen-tolerant route and notablyﬁxes CO

releasing it. The Lcm module relies onthe new-to-nature activity of a coen-
zyme B12-dependent mutase for the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
into lactyl-CoA. We demonstrate Lcm activity of the scaffold enzyme 2-
hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase fromBacillus massiliosenegalensis, and further
improve catalytic efﬁciency 10-fold by combining in vivo targeted hypermu-
tation and adaptive evolution in an engineeredEscherichia coliselection strain.
Finally, in a proof-of-principle, wedemonstrate the complete Lcm module
in vitro. Overall, our work demonstrates a synthetic CO
2-incorporating acetyl-
CoA assimilation route that expands themetabolic solution space of central
carbon metabolism, providing options for synthetic biology and metabolic
engineering.
Microbial one-carbon (C1) assimilation plays a key role in the global
carbon cycle1– 3, where it is responsible for theﬁxation of inorganic C1-
compounds, such as CO2, into biomass. Microbial C1-metabolism is
also of increasing interest for biotechnology: employing natural and
engineered microbial C1-metabolism is considered essential for
building a sustainable future biotechnology that is based on CO
2 as
the carbon source4. Almost all natural pathways for autotrophic car-
bon ﬁxation yield acetyl-CoA as the primaryﬁxation product, including
the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway as the most ancient and prominent
example5– 7 (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, acetyl-CoA is the
product of several proposed new-to-nature C1-ﬁxation pathways, for
example, the THETA cycle8,9, the 2-hydroxyglutarate-reductive TCA
cycle8, the reductive acetyl-CoA bicycle10,11 as well as the serine-
threonine cycle12.
Once formed, the central hub metabolite acetyl-CoA needs to be
further converted (i.e., assimilated) into all other cellular building
blocks

the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway13,14. Additional routes have been iden-
tiﬁed or proposed, such as the methylaspartate cycle in halophilic
archaea15 and the citramalate cycle in proteobacteria16. Notably, all of
the above-mentioned acetyl-CoA assimilation pathways ultimately lead
to the formation of a C4 compound, in most cases malate, which is
subsequently converted into oxaloacetate (Supplementary Fig. 1).
However, to synthesize C3 intermediates of central carbon metabo-
lism, such as pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), oxaloacetate
needs to be decarboxylated, which leads to a loss of previouslyﬁxed
carbon. In the context of microbial CO
2 valorization, such loss of car-
bon is not desired, as it requires additional investment of energy and
other cellular resources for (re-)assimilation of the released CO
2.
Assimilation of acetyl-CoA can also proceed without the release of
CO2 via reductive routes. These reductive routes involve a net invest-
ment of reducing power and co-assimilation of CO2, further con-
tributing to the cell’so v e r a l lC 1 -ﬁxation (Supplementary Fig. 2). For
instance, many anaerobic organisms utilize pyruvate synthase (pyr-
uvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase), an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, for the
direct reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate. This route is
used for example by microbes operating the reductive acetyl-CoA
pathway, reductive TCA cycle or as part of the archaeal dicarboxylate/
4-hydroxybutyrate cycle
17,18. Reductive (co-)assimilation of acetyl-CoA
with CO2 is also part of the oxygen-tolerant reaction sequences of the
3-hydroxypropionate bicycle19 or the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway20– 22.
However, the latter two routes are very long ( > 10 enzymes,
Supplementary Fig. 2) and still yield a C4 compound that is dec-
arboxylated again to form gluconeogenic C3 compounds.
In this work, we present the Lcm module, an oxygen-tolerant,
CO2-incorporating acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway that provides a
link from acetyl-CoA to pyruvate and other C3 intermediates of
gluconeogenesis (Fig.1). This pathway is based on the carboxylation
and conversion of acetyl-CoA into the C3 compound 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA), followed by its conversion
into lactyl-CoA, and ultimately pyruvate. Key to this pathway is a
new-to-nature carbon rearrangement from 3-HP-CoA into lactyl-
CoA (lactyl-CoA mutase, Lcm), which we establish by leveraging the
natural promiscuity of B
12-dependent mutases. We reconstitute the
cascade from acetyl-CoA to lactyl-CoA in vitro and identify Lcm as
the limiting bottleneck. Establishing the Lcm reaction in a selection
strain allows us to combine in vivo random mutagenesis and
adaptive evolution to further improve Lcm. We conﬁrm improved
Lcm activity in vitro and report up to 10-fold improved catalytic
efﬁciency of the identiﬁed Lcm variants compared to the wild-type
enzyme. Overall, this work lays the foundation for a new-to-nature
acetyl-CoA assimilation module that directly links acetyl-CoA with
pyruvate. This module could improve acetyl-CoA assimilation
in the context of several C1-assimilating pathways that were
recently demonstrated
9,12, and also opens the way for the imple-
mentation of highly efﬁcient synthetic CO2 ﬁxation cycles in the
future (Supplementary Fig. 3)11.

Results
Design of an oxygen-tolerant, CO2-assimilating acetyl-CoA
assimilation route
To establish a CO2-assimilating, oxygen-tolerant route from acetyl-
CoA to pyruvate, we envisioned using the carboxylation of acetyl-
CoA to malonyl-CoA, followed by reduction of the latter to
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) and subsequent activation into 3-HP-
CoA. We considered the conversion of 3-HP-CoA into lactyl-CoA by a
new-to-nature enzymatic activity, and lastly, the conversion of lactyl-
CoA into lactate, the precursor of the target metabolite pyruvate
(Lcm module, highlighted blue in Fig.1, shown in detail in Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). Although C4 compounds are not part of the Lcm
module, they can easily be synthesized from pyruvate via another
carboxylation reaction (by pyruvate carboxylase or PEP carboxylase).
The Lcm module outperforms most other acetyl-CoA assimilation
routes in terms of thermodynamic favorability (max-min driving
force, MDF)
23– 25 and ATP requirement (Supplementary Data 1, Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, it is the shortest aerobic route for
the synthesis of pyruvate (6 reactions) or oxaloacetate (7-8 reactions)
from acetyl-CoA. There are only two shorter alternatives (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2): a natural one involving pyruvate synthase, and a
synthetic one, the alanine aminomutase route, which has not yet
been demonstrated experimentally
11. However, both rely on highly
oxygen-sensitive (and partially inefﬁcient) biocatalysts26– 28, which
makes their application in biotechnological standard platform
organisms highly challenging.
In vitro screening of enzyme candidates for Lcm activity
To identify suitable candidates for the direct interconversion of 3-HP-
CoA and lactyl-CoA (Fig. 2A), we aimed to employ the radical
mechanism of O
2-tolerant B12-dependent CoA-thioester mutases. We
focused on 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutases29– 33 (Hcm) that catalyze
the reversible isomerization of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 2-hydro-
xyisobutyryl-CoA, which are structurally similar to 3-HP-CoA and lac-
tyl-CoA, respectively (Fig. 2B). We heterologously produced six
homologs (Supplementary Fig. 4A), of which we could successfully
purify only the three candidates that had already been characterized
previously
29,30,34, namely the 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutases from
Aquincola tertiaricarbonis, Kyrpidia tusciaeand Bacillus massiliosene-
galensis (also referred to asRobertmurraya massiliosenegalensis)35– 37.

ionic strength 0.25 M). Note that 3-HP-CoA isomerization yields lactyl-
CoA, which is a chiral product (L-o r D-lactyl-CoA). To test for Lcm
activity and determine the reaction stereospeciﬁcity, we thus ﬁrst
screened our three candidates for 3-HP-CoA forming activity, starting
from enantiopureL-o rD-lactyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 4B). At 30 °C,
the enzyme from the mesophilic organismB. massiliosenegalensis
showed the highest activity withL-lactyl-CoA (Fig. 2C), while the
mutase from the thermophilic organismK. tusciaehad about 2-fold
lower activity in these conditions. In contrast, the enzyme candidate
from A. tertiaricarbonishad no detectable activity with
L-lactyl-CoA,
despite the fact that we conﬁrmed functionality of this puriﬁed
enzyme with its native substrate 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4C). None of the mutases showed detectable activity with
D-lactyl-CoA.
Due to its mesophilic properties and the basal activity withL-
lactyl-CoA, we decided to further test the Hcm fromB. massiliose-
negalensis and conﬁrmed that the enzyme also catalyzed lactyl-CoA
formation from 3-HP-CoA (Supplementary Figs. 4D– F) and deter-
mined the kinetic parameters for both the native and promiscuous
reaction, forming 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA or 3-HP-CoA, respectively
(Fig. 2C, D).
With its native substrate 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, theB. massi-
liosenegalensis mutase showed a relatively low turnover frequency

activity withL-lactyl-CoA was even slower (kcat = 0.03 ± 0.01 s−1), and
the Km value forL-lactyl-CoA (0.14 ± 0.09 mM) was higher than for the
native substrate 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA (Fig.2C, D). Overall, these
experiments establishedL-lactyl-CoA mutase (Lcm), but also indicated
that Lcm activity was very low and likely rate-limiting for any applica-
tion that requires highﬂux through this reaction in vitro or in vivo.
The reconstituted Lcm module converts acetyl-CoA into lactyl-
CoA in vitro
In order to test whether Lcm would be functional in our new-to-nature
acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway, wenext sought to reconstitute the

pathway encompassesﬁve reactions (reactions #1– 5, Fig.2E) convert-
ing acetyl-CoA to lactyl-CoA, which we will refer to as theLcm module
in the following (Fig.2E). Besides Lcm fromB. massiliosenegalensis
(reaction #5), we chose propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PccD407I from
Methylobacterium extorquens
39) for the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA
(reaction #1) and bi-functional malonyl-CoA reductase fromChloro-
ﬂexus aurantiacus40 for the reduction of malonyl-CoA into 3-HP (#2-3,
Fig. 2E). For the activation of 3-HP into 3-HP-CoA (reaction #4, Fig.2E),
we considered two alternative designs, a CoA-transferase route and a
CoA ligase route.
For the CoA-transferase route, we tested four different CoA-
transferases (AbfT from Clostridium aminobutyricum (UniProt ID
Q9RM86), Frc fromOxalobacter formigenes(UniProt ID O06644), Pct
from Cupriavidus necator(UniProt ID Q0K874) andE. coliYfdE (Uni-
Prot ID P76518). Of these, the 4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase
AbfT, and the propionyl-CoA-transferase Pct performed best with 3-HP
as CoA-acceptor and acetyl-CoA as CoA-donor (Supplementary
Fig. 5A). Notably, these enzymes were also capable of recycling the
CoA moiety between 3-HP-CoA and lactyl-CoA by using 3-HP-CoA as
CoA-donor and
L-lactate as CoA-acceptor, albeit at lower catalytic
efﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. 5B).
Next, we evaluated whether the activation of 3-HP by AbfT would
also be functional within the context of the complete Lcm module
(Fig.2E). Notably, acetyl-CoA is not only the preferred CoA-donor for 3-
HP, but also the substrate of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Therefore, we
ﬁrst evaluated whether the partial cascade with AbfT would yield suf-
ﬁcient concentrations of the Lcm substrate 3-HP-CoA. However, acetyl-
CoA became quickly depleted and was likely not available at sufﬁcient
concentrations for 3-HP activation, as indicated by very low 3-HP-CoA
pools ( ~ 3µM) that we observed in our experiments (Supplementary
Fig. 5C), indicating a general limitation of the CoA-transferase route.
For the CoA ligase route, we substituted AbfT with a propionyl-
CoA ligase (Pcl) fromC. necatorthat was previously shown to catalyze
the activation of 3-HP
39. The use of Pcl in the context of the complete
Lcm module did not only lead to more than ten times increased 3-HP-
CoA levels ( ~ 40µM after 2 h, Supplementary Fig. 5D), but also resulted
in the formation of 15µM lactyl-CoA from 1 mM acetyl-CoA after 2 h,
which is equivalent to 1.5% yield (Supplementary Fig. 5D). Despite this
improvement, however, we still observed an accumulation of 3-HP,
which suggested that the activation of 3-HP to 3-HP-CoA remained a
limiting bottleneck. Since Pcl suffers from a highK
m towards 3-HP39,w e
decided to replace it with the ligase domain of the propionyl-CoA
synthase fromErythrobacter sp.N A P 1( P c s ,F i g .2E) that catalyzes the
same reaction
41. The use of Pcs increased the 3-HP-CoA concentration
to 100µM after 2 h, but did not further increase lactyl-CoA levels.
Lactyl-CoA levels reached ~20µM after 2 h, which let us assume that
Lcm activity was the bottleneck of the Lcm module (Supplementary
Fig. 5E). This was supported by the fact that while 3-HP-CoA con-
centration continued to increase up to 500µM within 22.5 h, the Lcm
module with Pcs produced only about 50µM
L-lactyl-CoA (5% conver-
sion) and peaked at about 6 h (Fig.2F, Supplementary Fig. 5E).
Having demonstrated the feasibility of the Lcm module and
conﬁrmed Lcm as the limiting bottleneck in the cascade, we next
aimed to engineer improved Lcm variants. However, all our rational
efforts that targeted differentﬁrst-shell active site residues, which we
expected to coordinate the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 6A), ren-
dered the protein inactive (Supplementary Fig. 6B), so we turned our
attention to a random mutagenesis-based approach.
Design of a growth-coupled selection strain to test for Lcm
activity in vivo
To improve Lcm activity, we sought to generate different Lcm variants
by random mutagenesis and screen them with a selection strain that
would rely on the mutase activity for growth. Because of the low cat-
alytic activity of Lcm ( ~ 0.03 s
−1), we aimed to design a strain with
relatively low selective demand. For this goal, we repurposed aβ-
alanine auxotrophy42,43.
In E. coli, low amounts of the non-proteinogenic amino acidβ-
alanine are essential for CoA biosynthesis. Natively,E. coliproduces the
requiredβ-alanine via decarboxylation ofL-aspartate44. Deletion of the
gene encoding the corresponding enzyme (panD) creates an auxo-
trophy, which can be rescued by supplementation ofβ-alanine43.W e
aimed to replace the nativepanD-based route for production ofβ-
alanine by an Lcm-dependent pathway proceeding fromL-Lactate via
3-HP (Fig.3A). Initially, we conﬁrmed that 3-HP can be converted into
β-alanine through the chromosomal expression of two heterologous
helper genes, encoding a 3-HP dehydrogenase andβ-alanine transa-
minase. As anticipated, growth of theβ-alanine auxotrophic strain
could be rescued by addition of 3-HP, with the lower limit of detection
reaching a low micro-molar range, conﬁrming the general feasibility of
our screening strategy (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B).
We next sought to introduce Lcm in combination with a CoA-
transferase and test for growth on
L-lactate (Fig.3A). We expressed
Lcm together with its native chaperone MeaB using a previously
reported expression system with a medium-copy pBBR1 origin
30 and
tested two different CoA-transferases, AbfT and Pct, from our in vitro
assays (Supplementary Fig. 7C). Overexpression of the genes encoding
AbfT and Lcm allowed growth of the selection strain with
L-lactate
instead of 3-HP (Fig. 3B). This growth was only observed upon
expression of both genes and was strictly dependent on the addition of
both L-lactate and B12 (supplemented as cyanocobalamin to the med-
ium), providing evidence for Lcm-activity in vivo (Supplementary
Fig. 7C, D). We tested three different AbfT expression levels (chro-
mosomal expression with two different ribosomal binding sites (RBS

expression from a low-copy plasmid). We found that albeit all strains
could grow in a lactate-dependent manner, AbfT expression from the
genome with RBS“A” resulted in the highest OD
600 values at lowL-
lactate concentrations (Fig.3B). Notably, with all constructs, a few
doublings were observed in medium lacking B12, before growth
ceased, which can be attributed to utilization of residual intracellular
B
12 from the preculture46.
To independently verify operation of the Lcm pathway, we used
13C-labeling with13C3-L-lactate (Supplementary Fig. 8) and analyzed the
CoA isotope pattern with high resolution-mass spectrometry. While
the labeling pattern of CoA was relatively complex, almost no CoA
appeared unlabeled, single- or double-labeled in theβ-alanine auxo-
troph with the Lcm module (Supplementary Fig. 8B). This was in
contrast to the wild type and in line with incorporation of the triple-
labeled unit from
13C3-L-lactate. Furthermore, detailed analysis of
triple-labeled CoA showed that in theβ-alanine auxotroph with the
Lcm module, the label indeed resided in theβ-alanine-containing
fragment (Supplementary Fig. 8C). In summary, both growth behavior
and labeling distribution observed for theβ-alanine auxotroph con-
ﬁrmed Lcm-dependent growth and thus Lcm activity in a metabolic
context in vivo.
Combining in vivo hypermutation with growth-coupled selec-
tion identiﬁes improved Lcm variants
Next, we created a library of Lcm variants by randomized mutagenesis
targeting the Lcm expression plasmid. To combine library generation
and growth-coupled selection for optimized Lcm variants, we per-
formed targeted in vivo hypermutation via the eMutaT7 system47
(Supplementary Fig. 9A) followed by subsequent short-term adaptive
evolution in theβ-alanine auxotroph (Supplementary Fig. 9B). Unfor-
t u n a t e l y ,w ed i dn o to b t a i ng r o w t ho ft h eβ-alanine auxotroph
expressing Lcm from the eMutaT7 target plasmid (pMutaT7-Lcm, see
Methods
48) in selective conditions when the mutator plasmid (pMu-
tator; see Methods47) was co-expressed. Therefore, we produced two
independent libraries (#1 and #2) of Lcm variants by induction of the
eMutaT7 system in non-selective conditions (LB medium) overnight.
To enrich these diversiﬁed populations for the most active Lcm var-
iants, we subsequently propagated these libraries in medium selecting
for Lcm activity and cured them from the pMutator plasmid (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9B).
When no further growth improvement was observed during the
selective propagations, growth of both evolved populations wasﬁrst
compared to that of the parental strain and the pBBR1-Lcm containing
strain in a plate reader (Supplementary Fig. 10). Single clones were
isolated and tested on selective medium, where the mean growth rate
of all growing clones isolated from both libraries was higher than that
of the non-evolved parental strain (expressing Lcm from the single-
copy MutaT7 target plasmid) as well as the initially characterized strain
expressing Lcm from the medium-copy pBBR1-plasmid (Fig.4A).
Sequencing of the Lcm expression plasmids from these strains showed
four distinct variants which all carried mutations in the large Lcm-
subunit (Lcm-A) and/or in the chaperone MeaB (Table1).
No mutations were found in the promoter region of the plasmids,
indicating that changes in the Lcm sequence were responsible for
growth improvement rather than merely changes in expression level.
To verify that these mutations were responsible and sufﬁcient for the
observed phenotype, we re-introduced the mutated plasmids into the
non-evolved parental background (β-alanine auxotroph with chro-
mosomal rbsA-abfT expression). In each case, this reproduced the
observed growth phenotype (Fig.4B and Supplementary Fig. 11),
conﬁrming that no additional adaptation was required.

strain in vivo. A As t r a i nd e l e t e di nn a t i v eβ-alanine biosynthesis routes andL-
lactate dehydrogenase (β-alanine auxotroph, see Supplementary Data 2 for details)
relies on joint activity of a CoA-transferase and Lcm to convertL-lactate to
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP). The helper enzymes 3-HP dehydrogenase (3-HPDH)
and β-alanine transaminase (BaOAT) convert 3-HP toβ-alanine, which is required
for CoA biosynthesis.B Expression of the CoA-transferase AbfT (expression
indicated in each graph) and the Lcm (pBBR1-Lcm) reconstitute the ability of theβ-
alanine auxotroph to grow withL-lactate (colored lines) instead of 3-HP (dotted
lines). No growth was observed in negative controls lackingL-lactate (light gray) or
B12 (dark gray), respectively. Chromosomal expression of AbfT with ribosomal
binding site (rbs)“A” results in the highest biomass yields with the lowest amounts
of
L-lactate. Source data are provided as a Source Dataﬁle.

amino acid change directly pointed at the substrate or towards the
active site, indicating rather subtle changes to the active site geometry
in these three Lcm variants (Supplementary Fig. 12). Additionally, none
of the evolved mutations appear to be located at the binding interface
of Lcm and its chaperone MeaB, as modeled using AlphaFold2 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13).
Lcm variants show improved activity in vitro
To test the effect of the different mutations on catalytic activity, we
puriﬁed the individual Lcm variants and determined their kinetics. In
all three Lcm variants, bothkcat and Km were improved (Fig.5A, B),
resulting in an increase of catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km)b y5 - f o l d( v a r -
iant P163L and variant E102K) and 10-fold (variant V92I E137K) com-
pared to the wild type (Fig.5B, Table2), when testing in the direction of
3-HP-CoA formation.
This trend was conﬁrmed also in the reverse direction, i.e. when
measuring lactyl-CoA formation from 3-HP over time (Fig.5C). In these
assays, however, we noticed that P163L appeared to be more instable
and was repeatedly inactive after prolonged incubation on ice.
Having identiﬁed three improved Lcm variants, weﬁnally tested
these enzymes in the context of the complete Lcm module in vitro
(Fig. 5D). Notably, in these assays, the variant E102K performed better
than the wild type, while the variants V92I E137K and P163L compared
similar or even worse (P163L), indicating that not only kinetics, but also
enzyme stability (i.e. P163L) might be an important factor in vitro.
Given the sensitivity of B
12-dependent enzymes to inactivation by
molecular oxygen, particularly in vitro, we hoped that supplying more
B
12 could improve Lcm activity and thus lactyl-CoA yield of the Lcm
module in our in vitro assay. To test this hypothesis, weﬁrst compared
the mutase turnover with 12.5µMB 12 (2.5x excess over enzyme) and
500 µM (100x excess), and found that higher B12 concentrations
increased enzyme turnover by 30% (Supplementary Fig. 14A). How-
ever, when we tested the entire cascade with 12.5µM (2.5x excess over
enzyme), 100µM( 2 0 xe x c e s s )a n d5 0 0µMB
12 (100x excess), the B12-
dependent increase in lactyl-CoA concentrations after six hours was
much less pronounced (Supplementary Fig. 14B). Since high B12-con-
centrations were previously shown to impair in vitro operation of the
CETCH and THETA cycles
9,49, we hypothesized that one of the other
Lcm module enzymes might be inhibited by the additional B12.I n d e e d ,
we saw that Pcs-dependent 3-HP-CoA formation from 3-HP decreased
with increasing B
12 concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 14B). To test
whether the Pcs would suffer from B12-dependent inhibition, we tested
only Pcs and wild-type Lcm on 1 mM 3-HP and found a severe decrease
in 3-HP-CoA formation that was correlated to the B
12 concentration
(Supplementary Fig. 14C). In summary, theseﬁndings indicate that B12
stability and complex interactions of the cofactor with the reaction
cascade is a major drawback in vitro that would need to be further
engineered in the future.
Discussion
In this work, we established the Lcm module, a new-to-nature meta-
bolic pathway for the CO
2-assimilating, oxygen-tolerant conversion of
acetyl-CoA to pyruvate, which relies on a new-to-nature enzymatic
activity as the key reaction: the B
12-dependent conversion of lactyl-CoA
into 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA by lactyl-CoA mutase (Lcm).
Of several potential Lcm candidates, we identi ﬁed 2-
hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase (Hcm) fromB. massiliosenegalensisas
a functional scaffold with promiscuous Lcm side-activity in vitro and
in vivo. In the context of the complete Lcm module, this basal activity
sufﬁced to achieve a 5% conversion of acetyl-CoA into lactyl-CoA
within six hours in vitro, but appeared to be a kinetic bottleneck for the
pathway. Using a combination of growth-coupled selection and

hypermutation by the eMutaT7 system47,48,50,51, we improved the cata-
lytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) of Lcm ten-fold.
The Lcm activity expands the existing metabolic solution space52,
and can be ﬂexibly applied in several synthetic biology contexts.
Firstly, Lcm provides an alternative metabolic route for the microbial
production of the bioplastic precursor 3-hydroxypropionate
(3-HP)
53,54 or downstream bioproducts such as β-alanine and
malonate. Previous approaches to the biosynthesis of these com-
pounds either (i) depended on glycerol as a feedstock via an oxygen-
sensitive pathway involving glycerol dehydratase
55, (ii) relied on
decarboxylation of aspartate56,57, or (iii) required ATP-dependent
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA58. In contrast to these routes, the
Lcm module could allow biosynthesis of 3-HP directly from pyruvate
via lactate, which can be produced at high yields via canonical
sugar fermentation by industrially well-established hosts such asE.
coli. Indeed, the potential of 3-HP production from lactate was
recognized in previous theoretical studies
53,54, however, the Lcm
module now provides an experimental proof-of-principle for this
production route.
Secondly (and as initially intended), the Lcm module can serve as
an extension of aerobic C1-assimilating pathways that yield acetyl-CoA
as their direct product, such as the THETA cycle or the serine-
threonine cycle
9,12, which allows to improve their biomass yields
through co-ﬁxation of CO2 during downstream acetyl-CoA assimilation
(Supplementary Data 1). Indeed, carbon-conserving routes to convert
intermediates of CO
2 ﬁxation to central metabolites have been
explored before, for example by engineering a non-oxidative glyco-
lysis or the reverse glyoxylate shunt
59,60.
Thirdly, the Lcm module could assist in the microbial production of
value-added chemicals from compounds feeding directly into acetyl-
CoA, such as ethanol and acetate
61,62. These two-carbonfeedstocks are
already sustainably produced at industrial scale via syngas
fermentation
63, and can also be derived from waste streams, degradation
of lignocellulosic biomass64 or via abiotic, electrochemical synthesis65,66.
Lastly, the Lcm module can be used as a core sequence of syn-
thetic CO2-ﬁxation pathways: the Lcm-dependent conversion of 3-HP-
CoA to lactyl-CoA could allow implementing a variant of the previously
described malonyl-CoA-oxaloacetate-glyoxylate cycles (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3)
11.
However, for the majority of these applications, the Lcm activity
must be further improved. Both acetyl-CoA assimilation and synthetic
CO
2 ﬁxation cycles require highﬂux. Despite the signiﬁcant perfor-
mance improvement compared to the wild-type Lcm, the turnover of
the best Lcm variant described here (k
cat =0 . 1 1±0 . 0 0 9s−1) is still two
orders of magnitude below that of an average enzyme (kcat ≈ 10 s−1)38.

Thus, all future applications would beneﬁt from Lcm variants with
higher turnover than achieved so far. We envision that such
improvements could be achieved by additional rounds of mutagenesis
and subsequent screening using the workﬂows and selections estab-
lished here, or in selections with higherﬂux demand. Since the Hcm
scaffold we chose is slow even with its native substrate, we expect that
sampling further candidates from the natural diversity of Hcm
homologs may aid the identiﬁcation of faster Lcm catalysts
29,32,33,67.
Indeed, related B12-dependent mutases achieve much higher turnover
frequencies. For instance, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Mcm) is part of
central metabolism in multiple organisms and has been reported to
achieve k
cat values above 200 s−1 (e.g. Methylobacterium extorquens
Mcm with akcat of 255 s−1)68,69. Therefore, we reason that the reaction
mechanism itself should allow evolving the lactyl-CoA mutase towards
even higher turnovers than those observed for the native reaction of
Hcm
29,32,33.
For future applications in a cell-free context, optimization of the
stability and oxygen-tolerance of Lcm may represent another impor-
tant target, since inactivation of B
12-dependent mutases by molecular
oxygen is well-described, especially in vitro69– 74. We emphasize that
applications of Lcm in vivo allow the co-expression of chaperones
(MeaB)
69,75, salvage of damaged coenzyme B12
76 and improved pro-
tection of the coenzyme from photolysis and oxidative damage in the
reductive intracellular environment. Applications in vivo thus likely
present a more promising environment for future implementations of
Lcm compared to in vitro systems.
In summary, Lcm and the Lcm module open possibilities
for metabolic engineering and might– upon further improvement in
the future– become valuable additions to ongoing efforts of creating
new C1-assimilating metabolic pathways for a sustainable
bioeconomy.
Methods
MDF analysis
To determine the net reaction equations of all acetyl-CoA assimilation
modules and evaluate their thermodynamic feasibility in physiological
conditions, Max-Min Driving Force (MDF) analysis was conducted
using the Python packages equilibrator API and equilibrator pathway
(version 0.6.0 for both)
25. Changes in Gibbs Free Energy were esti-
mated using the Component Contribution Method25.F o ra l lc a r b o x -
ylation reactions, CO2 (rather than bicarbonate) was considered as
substrate since its concentration is pH-independent9. Default values
were used, i.e. the pH was set to 7.5, magnesium concentration was set
to 1 mM (pMg = 3), ionic strength 0.25 M, and metabolite and cofactor
concentrations were constrained to physiologically relevant con-
centrations (1µM – 10 mM)
77.
Protein production and puriﬁcation
To produce recombinant proteins,E. coliBL21 (DE3) (for all proteins
except the mutases) orE. coliArcticExpress (DE3) (all mutase variants
and subunits) were transformed via heat-shock with the respective
plasmids and plated on LB plates with the respective antibiotics. The
cells were scraped off the plate and inoculated in TB (12 g/L tryptone,
24 g/L yeast extract, 17 mM KH
2PO4,7 2 m MK2HPO4, 0.5% (v/v) gly-
cerol) with antibiotic. For puriﬁcation from ArcticExpress (DE3),
gentamycin was supplied as well. The cells were grown at 37 °C,
120 rpm until an OD
600 of ~0.7-0.9 was reached. The cultures were
cooled down to 25 °C (BL21(DE3) or 16 °C (ArcticExpress (DE3)) and
induced with 500μM IPTG (pET) or 50µg/L anhydrotetracycline
(pASG-IBA43). The culture was incubated overnight and harvested
the next day (4000 ×g, 10 min, 10 °C). The pellet was resupended in
Buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl) and sonicated on ice to
lyse the cells (KE76 probe, 1 min, 01 s on 01 s off, 3x in total) or
microﬂuidized 3 times with 18,000 psi. The lysed cells were cen-
trifuged (100,000 ×g, 45 min, 4 °C) to separate soluble and insoluble
fraction. The soluble fraction was loaded onto Ni-NTA agar resin
(Macherey-Nagel) that was previously equilibrated with wash buffer
(50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM Imidazole, 500 mM KCl). The resin was
washed with 70 mL wash buffer and then eluted with 2 mL Buffer B
(50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM Imidazol, 500 mM KCl). The proteins
were desalted into Buffer D (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl)
using an ÄKTA start system with HiTrap Desalting columns (GE
healthcare) or PD-10 columns (Cytiva) and concentrated on Amicon
ﬁlters. The proteins were ﬂash frozen in liquid N
2 and stored at
−70 °C. PCC D407I, a PCC variant described by Scheffen et al.78, was
puriﬁed by His-tag puriﬁcation as described above.
In vitro characterization of Lcm
To measure Lcm-based formation of 3-HP-CoA fromL-lactyl-CoA, the
Lcm reaction was coupled to PhaJ-mediated dehydration of 3-HP-CoA
to acrylyl-CoA, which was reduced to propionyl-CoA in an NADPH
consuming reaction catalyzed by Etr1p from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae41. For detection of Hcm based formation of (R)−3-hydro-
xybutyryl-CoA from 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, the same assay was
used with PhaJ producing crotonyl-CoA from (R)−3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA and Etr1p producing butyryl-CoA from the latter in an NADPH
reducing manner. Both PhaJ and Etr1p had previously been shown not
to be rate limiting. 12.5µMc o e n z y m eB
12 were supplied in all assays,
which additionally contained 50 mM NaPO4 pH 7 and 5µMo fe a c h
mutase subunit. B12 and both mutase subunits were mixed and incu-
bated in the assay cuvette for one minute before activity measure-
ments. The NADPH consumption was followed by measuring the
change of absorption at 340 nm in a Cary60 UV-Vis spectro-
photometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the kinetics program
with 0.5 s save time. A reaction volume of 100µL was used in a High
Precision Cell 10 mm Light Path quartz cuvette (Hellma Analytics,
Müllheim, Germany) at 30 °C. Initial velocity measurements were
performed in triplicates, and turnover frequencies were calculated
based on Lambert-Beer’sl a ww i t hε
(340 nm) = 6.22 mM−1 cm−1 and ﬁt
using the Michaelis-Menten function in Prism 8 (Graphpad, San Diego,
California, USA). To test formation of lactyl-CoA, 50 mM NaPO4 pH 7,
10 mM MgCl
2,1 0µM of both subunits, 15µMc o e n z y m eB12 and 1.5 mM
3-HP-CoA were assembled. The reaction was run at 30 °C and quen-
ched with formic acid to a total concentration of 10% (v/v) and sub-
sequently analyzed with LC-MS.
In vitro screening of CoA-transferases
Screening of candidates that can transfer the CoA moiety from 3-HP-
CoA to
L-lactyl-CoA was performed using LC-MS assays.
Here, 1 mM of neutralized acid (L-lactic acid or 3-hydroxypropionic
acid) was incubated in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 and
100 µM of CoA donor (acetyl-CoA,L-lactyl-CoA or 3-HP-CoA). The
reaction was started by the addition of 1µM of the respective CoA-
transferase. The assay was run at 30 °C for 1 h. Samples were quen-
ched in formic acid to aﬁnal concentration of 10% (v/v) and analyzed
via LC-MS.
In vitro testing of the acetyl-CoA assimilation module
In order to assess the capability of the mutase to be part of an acetyl-
CoA assimilation pathway, we assembled the pathway in vitro. In brief,

concentration of 10% (v/v) and analyzed via LC-MS. If needed, samples
were diluted further.

In vitro testing of B12-dependent Pcs inhibition
To determine the effect of B12 on Pcs and Lcm activity, we tested their
joint activity from 3-HP with varying B12 concentrations in vitro. For
this, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mM TECEP, 10 mM MgCl2,5 µM
BmHcmA (wild-type variant), 5µM BmHcmB, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM Crea-

nylate kinase fromE. coli and 1µM Pcs and coenzyme B12 (tested
concentrations were 12.5µM, 100µM, 500µM) were assembled into a
tube. The reaction was run at 30 °C for up to ~6 h and started by the
addition of 1 mM 3-HP. Samples were quenched in formic acid to aﬁnal
concentration of 10% (v/v) and analyzed via LC-MS. If needed, samples
were diluted further.
CoA thioester synthesis
CoA thioesters were synthesized using the CDI route79.D i v e r g e n tf r o m
the published method, the synthesis of lactyl-CoA was stirred over-
night on ice after addition of free CoA to CDI-activated lactic acid.
Enantiopure acids were used for the synthesis of
L-o rD-lactyl-CoA. The
synthesis product was puriﬁed using a preparative Agilent 1260 Inﬁnity
HPLC with a Gemini 10μm NX-C18 110 Å column. The puriﬁed CoA
thioesters wereﬂash frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized and stored dry at
−20 °C. The product identity was conﬁrmed via LC-MS.
Quantiﬁcation of lactyl-CoA, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, malonyl-
CoA and acetyl-CoA
Quantitative metabolite determination was performed using a LC-MS/
MS. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Inﬁnity
II 1290 HPLC system with a Kinetex EVO C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3
μm particle size, 100Å pore size, Phenomenex) connected to a guard
column of similar speciﬁcity (20 × 2.1 mm, 3μm particle size, Phe-
nomenex) at a constantﬂow rate of 0.2 mL/min and an injection
volume of 1µL. The mobile phase A was 50 mM Ammonium Acetate in
water at a pH of 8.1 and phase B was 100% methanol (Honeywell,
Morristown, New Jersey, USA) at 40 °C column temperature. The
mobile phase proﬁle consisted of the following steps and linear gra-
dients: 0– 7 min constant at 5% B; 7– 8 min from 5 to 95% B; 8– 9m i n
constant at 95% B; 9– 9.1 min from 95 to 5% B; 9.1 to 15 min constant at
5% B. An Agilent 6495 ion funnel mass spectrometer was used in
positive mode with an electrospray ionization source and the following
conditions: ESI spray voltage 1000 V, nozzle voltage 1000 V, sheath gas
350 °C at 12 l/min, nebulizer pressure 20 psig and drying gas 100 °C at
11 l/min. Compounds were identiﬁed based on their mass transition
and retention time compared to standards. Chromatograms were
integrated using the MassHunter software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Relative abundance was determined based on the peak area.
Absolute concentrations were determined based on an external Stan-

tages and Dwell times have been optimized using chemically pure
standards. Parameter settings of alltargets are given in Supplementary

Quantiﬁcation of 3-hydroxypropionate and lactate
Quantiﬁcation of 3-HP and lactate was performed as described above
for CoA esters, but at a constantﬂow rate of 0.1 mL/min with mobile
phase A being 0.1% formic acid in water and phase B being 0.1% formic
acid in methanol (Honeywell, Morristown, New Jersey, USA) at 25 °C.
The injection volume was 1µL. The proﬁle of the mobile phase con-
sisted of the following steps and linear gradients: 0– 6 min constant at
0% B; 6– 7 min from 0% to 100% B; 7– 8 min constant at 100% B;
8– 8.1 min from 100% to 0% B; 8.1– 1 2m i nc o n s t a n ta t0 %B .A nA g i l e n t
6495 ion funnel mass spectrometer was used in negative mode with an
electrospray ionization source and the following conditions: ESI spray
voltage 2000 V, nozzle voltage 500 V, sheath gas 260 °C at 10 L/min,
nebulizer pressure 35 psig and drying gas 100 °C at 13 L/min. Para-
meter settings of all targets are given in Supplementary Table 3.
Strain construction
All E. colistrains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 2.
We used strain SIJ488 as a wild-type starting strain, which carries
inducible recombinase andﬂippase genes
80. Gene deletions were done
by eitherλ-red recombineering or P1-transduction, as described below.
Gene deletion and genome integration by recombineering
To delete genes byλ-red recombineering, chloramphenicol resistance
cassettes with overhangs homologous to the target locus were gen-
erated by PCR using KO primers (Supplementary Data 3), the chlor-
amphenicol (Cap) cassette from pKD3 (pKD3 was a gift from Barry L.
Wanner (Addgene plasmid #45604; http://n2t.net/addgene:45604;
RRID:Addgene_45604)) as template and PrimeStar Max polymerase
(Takara Bio, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France). For gene deletion, the
target strains were inoculated in LB and grown to OD ~ 0.4– 0.5, fol-
lowed by addition of 15 mM
L-arabinose to induce recombinase gene
expression during 45 min cultivation at 37 °C. Then, cells were har-
vested and washed three times with ice cold 10% glycerol (11,000 rpm,
30 sec, 4 °C). Electroporation was performed using ~300 ng of Cap
resistance cassette and 100µL washed cells (1 mm cuvette, 1.8 kV,
25 µF, 200Ω). To select for successful gene deletion, cells were plated
on LB chloramphenicol. Further deletion conﬁrmation was done by
PCR, and antibiotic resistance removal was performed by growing cells
to OD ~ 0.3, inducingﬂippase expression by addition of 50 mM
L-
rhamnose, cultivation overnight at 30 °C and subsequent isolation of
single colonies on LB plates. Successful marker removal was conﬁrmed
by testing for antibiotic sensitivity and by PCR on the respective locus.
To chromosomally integrateabfT, the gene was initially cloned from
pZ-ASS into pKD3 (see section“Plasmid construction” below) and
subsequently ampliﬁed with PrimeStar Max polymerase and primers
carrying 50 bp overhangs to thelldD locus. To remove residual PCR
template, the PCR product was digested with DpnI (FastDigest,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) before puriﬁcation. The puriﬁed PCR product was
introduced into the genome via recombineering and successful inte-
gration was selected for via antibiotics as described above for
deletions.
To chromosomally integrate the 3-HPDH and BaOAT, a cassette
with 500 bp overhangs from both sides of the targeted gene was
generated. Followed by amplifying upstream overhangs, downstream
overhangs and target genes, an overlap PCR was performed. For the
integration of BaOAT in SS2, the left and right integration overhang
were ampliﬁed from pDM4-SS2 using primers SS2-KI_fwd + KI_B or
SS2_KI_rvs + KI_E, respectively. BaOAT was ampliﬁed from pZ-ASS using
the primers KI_C + KI_D. To integrate 3-HPDH in SS9, the left and right
integration overhang were ampliﬁed from pDM4-SS9 using primers
SS9-KI_fwd + KI_B or SS9_KI_rvs + KI_E, respectively. 3-HPDH was
ampliﬁed from pZ-ASS using the primers KI_C + KI_D. The product of
the overlap extension PCR was directly used as Knock-In cassette to
perform the genomic integration into the relevant loci (SS2 for BaOAT,
SS9 for 3-HPDH)
81 by electroporation as described for deletions byλ-
red recombineering.
Plasmid construction
For gene overexpression, abfT (CoA-transferase from Clostridium
aminobutyricum, UniProt ID Q9RM86) and 3-HPDH (3-hydro-
xyisobutyrate dehydrogenase pmHPD from Pseudomonas putida,
UniProt ID Q88E02) were codon optimized forE. coli’sc o d o nu s a g e82,
and restriction sites relevant for cloning were removed45 (for codon-
optimized sequences, see Supplementary Data 4). A His-tag withNsiI
restriction site was added to the start of the gene, anXbaI restriction
site was added behind the stop codon. The genes were synthesized
by Twist Bioscience (San Francisco, CA, USA). Cloning was performed
in E. coli DH5α.A l lg e n e sw e r ec u tv i aNsiI and XbaI (FastDigest,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) and ligated with a pZ-ASS-mCherry
83 vector cutNsiI
and NheI (FastDigest, Thermo Scientiﬁc) (thus removing mCherry and

linearizing the backbone) downstream of ribosome binding site“C”
(AAGTTAAGAGGCAAGA)45. pZ-ASS-lkBOT (BaOAT) was obtained from
ap r e v i o u ss t u d y84. For genome integration, the genes were transferred
from pZ-ASS to pKD3 by restriction of both vectors withNsiI and BspOI
(FastDigest, Thermo Scientiﬁc), gel puriﬁcation of fragments of the
desired size and subsequent ligation of pKD3 backbone with the
respective insert. Correct insert sizes were conﬁrmed using DreamTaq
polymerase (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Dreieich, Germany) and primers pZ-
ASS-F and pZ-ASS-R for pZ-ASS and pKD3-F and pKD3-R for pKD3. The
sequence of vectors with correct insert size was conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin, DE or Microsynth Seqlab, Göttin-
gen, DE). For in silico sequence analysis, the software Snapgene (GSL
Biotech LLC, San Diego, US) or Geneious (Auckland, New Zealand) was
used. pBBR1-Lcm was a gift from Thore Rohwerder. Target strains were
transformed with 40 ng of the correct plasmids by electroporation in
the same manner described for transformations withλ-red knockout
cassettes. Successful transformation was conﬁrmed by resistance to
plasmid speciﬁc antibiotics as well as colony PCR with plasmid speciﬁc
primers (as described above for pZ-ASS and pKD3; pBBR1-F and pBBR1-
R for pBBR1-Lcm) and DreamTaq polymerase (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Dreieich, Germany).
Media and growth experiments
LB medium (1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone) was used for
strain maintenance, cloning and deletion strain construction. If
required, antibiotics (kanamycin (50μg/mL), ampicillin (100μg/mL),
streptomycin, (100μg/mL), or chloramphenicol (30μg/mL)) were
added. Antibiotics were omitted ing r o w t he x p e r i m e n t s .S t a n d a r d

ments and strain evolution with the carbon sources indicated in the
text. For growth experiments, precultures were prepared in M9 med-
ium supplemented with and antibiotics for any plasmids present and
carbon sources depending on the strain. For strains expressing Lcm,
1m M I P T G a n d 1µMB

culture medium. For theβ-alanine aux. and derivative strains with
20 mM glycerol, 10 mML-lactate and 100µM 3-HP were added. After
harvesting grown overnight cultures (6000 xg,3m i n ) ,t h ec e l l sw e r e
washed three times in M9 medium to remove residual carbon sources,
antibiotics and cofactors. Growth experiments were performed in 96-
well microtiter plates (Nunclon Delta Surface, Thermo Scientiﬁc) at
37 °C and were inoculated with washed cells to an optical density
(OD
600)o f0 . 0 1i n1 5 0µL total culture volume per well. To avoid eva-
poration but allow gas exchange, 50μL mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich)
were added to each well. If not stated otherwise, growth was mon-
itored in technical triplicates in a BioTek Epoch 2 Microtiterplate
reader (BioTek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) by absorbance mea-
surements (OD
600) of each well every ~10 minutes with intermittent
orbital and linear shaking. As previously established empirically for the
instrument, blank measurements were subtracted and OD
600 mea-
surements were converted to cuvette OD600 values by multiplying with
a factor of 4.35. Growth curves represent the average of technical
triplicate measurements and were plotted in MATLAB version R2020a.
Isolation of CoA for13C isotopic labeling analysis
To conﬁrm utilization of the Lcm pathway for growth, isotopic labeling
patterns from metabolites of theβ-alanine aux. +pBBR1-Lcm +chro-
mosomal-rbsA-abfT grown on13C3 L-lactate were determined. To this
end, precultures of two biological replicates of theβ-alanine aux. strain
and aΔlldD strain wereﬁrst inoculated in M9 + 20 mM glycerol + 1 mM
L-lactate + 1 mM IPTG + 1µMB 12 and grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of > 1.
The cells from these precultures were harvested and washed three
times in M9 medium as described for growth experiments. The washed
cells were used to inoculate cultures in M9 + 20 mM glycerol + 1 mM
13C3 L-lactate + 1 mM IPTG + 1µMB 12.O ft h e s e ,t h eΔlldD culture was
immediately inoculated in technical triplicates, grown to an OD600 of
0.8 and immediately harvested. All cultures ofβ-alanine aux. strains
were propagated two more times in M9 + 20 mM glycerol + 1 mM13C3 L-
lactate + 1 mM IPTG + 1µMB 12, of which the last time technical tripli-
cates were inoculated, which were then harvested at an OD600 of 0.8.
Harvesting was always performed on ice. In a 2 mL Eppendorf tube,
metabolism was quenched by adding 1 mL cell culture of OD
600 of 0.8
to 1 mL−70 °C cold 70% methanol and inverting the tube once. Cell
harvesting was performed at− 1 0° C ,1 0m i n ,1 0 , 0 0 0xg,f o l l o w e db y
supernatant removal and pellet storage at−80 °C until endometabo-
lome extraction. For endometabolome extraction, extractionﬂuid (1:1
mixture of LC-MS grade methanol and TE-buffer pH 7.0 (10 mM
TRIZMA, 1 mM EDTA pH neutralized with HCl)) and HPLC grade
chloroform were cooled to−20 °C. To each cell pellet 200µLo f−20 °C

Pellets were resuspended by vortexing prior to shaking incubation at
4 °C for two hours. Phase separation was performed by centrifugation
at − 1 0° C ,1 0m i n ,1 0 , 0 0 0xg. The upper phase was carefully removed
with a pipette andﬁltered with a 0.2µM ﬁlter into a new Eppendorf
tube stored at−80 °C until metabolite measurement.
Untargeted13C isotopic labeling analysis for CoA
Quantitative determination of the targets was performed using high-
resolution LC-MS. The chromatographic separation was performed as
described above for CoA thioester quantiﬁcation at a constantﬂow
rate of 0.25 mL/min with an injection volume of 5µL. The mobile phase
proﬁle consisted of the following steps and linear gradients: 0– 2m i n
constant at 0% B; 2– 5m i n f r o m 0 t o 6 % B ; 5– 8 min from 6 to 23%;
8−10 min from 23 to 80%; 10−11 min constant at 80% B; 11– 12 min from
80 to 0% B; 12 to 18 min constant at 0% B. A Thermo ScientiﬁcI D - X
Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used in positive mode with an elec-
trospray ionization source and the following conditions: H-ESI spray
voltage at 3500 V, sheath gas at 50 arbitrary units, auxiliary gas at 10
arbitrary units, sweep gas at 1 arbitrary unit, ion transfer tube tem-
perature at 325 °C. Detection was performed in full scan mode using
the orbitrap mass analyzer at a mass resolution of 240 000 in the mass
range 765– 790 (m/z). Extracted ion chromatograms of the [M + H]+
forms were integrated using Traceﬁnder software (Thermo Scientiﬁc),
applying a mass accuracy of 5 ppm. Relative abundance was deter-
mined based on the peak area. The usedm/z values are given in Sup-
plementary Table 4.
Targeted 13C isotopic labeling analysis for CoA
Quantitative determination of thetarget metabolite was performed as
described above for CoA thioester quantiﬁcation, with the mobile phase
proﬁle used for untargeted isotopic labeling analysis. Detection and
analysis of the data was performed as described above for CoA thioester
quantiﬁcation. Relative abundance was determined based on the peak
area. Mass transitions, collision energies, Cell accelerator voltages and
Dwell times have been optimized using chemically pure standards.

L c me v o l u t i o ni nt h eβ-alanine auxotroph
To employ the eMutaT7 system for Lcm optimization, we cloned the
Lcm operon into the target plasmid (pHyo245; referred to pMutaT7 in
the main text for simplicity) in a HiFi assembly (New England Biolabs)
using the primers o611_pVS133_Lcm-operon_HiFi-F and o612_pVS133_
Lcm-operon_HiFi-R for Lcm ampli ﬁcation from pBBR1-Lcm and
o609_pVS133_backb_HiFi-Fwd and o610_pVS133_backb_HiFi-Rev for
ampliﬁcation of the pHyo245-backbone. Successful plasmid con-
struction was veriﬁed by plasmid ampliﬁcation using the primers
Ec153_mhp_Pro_V_F and P01_pZ_SF and PrimeStar Max polymerase and
subsequent amplicon sequencing by Plasmidsaurus. Theβ-alanine

auxotrophic strain with a chromosomal rbsA-abfT integration wasﬁrst
electroporated with the pMutaT7-Lcm plasmid, followed by recovery
and selection before electroporating with the pMutator plasmid. Two
separate cultures of the strain carrying both plasmids were inoculated
and grown overnight in LB medium with Ampicillin and Chlor-
amphenicol and 10 mM
L-arabinose for induced hypermutation (the
workﬂow is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 9B). The dense popula-
tions were harvested and washed three times in M9 minimal medium,
before inoculating cultures with selective medium (20 mM glycerol + 5
mM
L-lactate + 1 mM IPTG) in a 1:10 dilution. The selective cultures were
grown until an OD > 0.5 was reached before propagating the cells to
fresh medium in a 1:10 dilution. After six cultivations in minimal
medium, cells were streaked onto LB plates using a 10µL inoculation
loop. Growth of theﬁnal populations was compared to that of pre-
vious selection strains in a growth experiment. Single colonies were
tested for Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol sensitivity. After verifying
growth in selective medium for single colonies in tubes (11/15 of
library #1 and 3/15 of library #2 grew), their growth was compared to
that of previous strains in a plate reader growth experiment. From all
grown colonies, the pMutaT7-Lcm plasmid was isolated and ampli-
ﬁed using the primers Ec153_mhp_Pro_V_F and P01_pZ_SF and Pri-
meStar Max polymerase, and the amplicon was sequenced using the
Plasmidsaurus amplicon sequencing service. The isolated pMutaT7-
Lcm evo plasmids were electroporated into the originalβ-alanine
auxotrophic strain with a chromosomal rbsA-abfT integration again,
and growth in selective medium was veriﬁed. Mutated Lcm variants
were cloned into the pASG-IBA43 vector in a HiFi assembly using the
primers pASG-IBA43_fwd and pASG-IBA_rvs for backbone ampliﬁca-
tion and Lcm_fwd and Lcm_rvs for insert ampliﬁcation, both with
PrimeStar Max.
