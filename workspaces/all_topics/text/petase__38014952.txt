ABSTRACT Biodegradable plastics are one of the possible solutions for reducing plastic 
waste, yet the mechanisms and organisms involved in their degradation in the aquatic 
environment remain understudied. In this study, we have enriched a microbial com­
munity from North Sea water and sediment, capable of growing on the polyester 
poly(butylene succinate). This culture was grown on two other biodegradable polyesters, 
polycaprolactone and a poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) blend. The differen­
ces between microbial community structure and biodegradation activity on these 
three polymers were determined by metagenomics, metaproteomics, and respirome­
try analysis. In this study, we observed that the polymer type drives the commun­
ity structure and determines its biodegradation capability. When the PBS-enriched 
culture grew on the poly(butylene adipate- co-terephthalate) blend, the community 
was more diverse, yet showed the lowest biodegradation percentage, while poly(buty­
lene succinate) and polycaprolactone resulted in a less diverse community but much 
higher biodegradation activity. The dominating species were Alcanivorax sp., Thalasso­
bius sp., or Pseudomonas sp., depending on the substrate. In general, we have observed 
that Gammaproteobacteria were more abundant and active within the biofilm on the 
polymers and Alphaproteobacteria within the free-living fraction of the enrichments. 
Three putative hydrolases were recombinantly expressed and their hydrolytic activity on 
all polymers tested was verified. In conclusion, we showed that all three plastics can be 
biodegraded by bacteria naturally occurring within the marine environment.
IMPORTANCE Biodegradable plastics can be used in applications where the end 
product cannot be efficiently recycled due to high levels of contaminations, e.g., food 
or soil. Some of these plastics have a dedicated end of life, such as composting, but their 
degradation in the marine environment is poorly understood. In this study we showed 
that marine microbial communities can degrade a range of biodegradable polymers 
with different physical and chemical properties and use these as a sole carbon source 
for growth. We have also provided insights into the degradation mechanisms using a 
combined metagenomic and metaproteomic approach. In addition, we have identified 
three new enzymes that are capable of degrading both aliphatic polymers and aliphatic-
aromatic copolymers, which can be used for biotechnological applications.

iodegradable plastics are manufactured as an alternative to conventional plastics for 
specific applications in order to reduce the environmental impact of plastics ( 1, 2). 
They usually contain ester linkages that are more amenable to microbial degradation 
than carbon-carbon backbones present in recalcitrant plastics such as polyethylene and 
polystyrene (3, 4). Aliphatic polyesters such as poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), polycapro­
lactone (PCL), polylactic acid, and aliphatic-aromatic polyesters such as poly(butylene-
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and its derivatives are examples of biodegradable

plastics. These are used in specific applications where the end product is short-lived, has 
a high risk of loss or wear during usage, and/or where recycling is not possible or 
practical due to food or soil contamination.
Of these polymers, PBS is of special interest due to its mechanical properties which 
are similar to those of polyolefins ( 2, 4, 5) while also having the possibility of being 
manufactured as a bio-based polymer. Both building blocks, succinic acid (Su) and 
1,4-butanediol (B), can be obtained from the fermentation of sugars or other biomasses 
such as lignocellulose ( 6–9). This polymer is certified compostable under industrial and 
home-composting conditions. To improve its mechanical and thermal properties, PBS 
can be blended with other polyesters, such as PLA ( 1, 10, 11) or PCL ( 12, 13). PBS 
has been certified as compostable in industrial composters and for home composting 
(https://www.mcpp-global.com/en/mcpp-asia/products/brand/biopbsTM/, last accessed 
11.08.2023), but not as marine biodegradable.
PBS is degraded by several fungal isolates ( 14–17), mostly from the terrestrial 
environment. However, the biodegradation of PBS by bacterial isolates has not been 
frequently reported. A PBS-degrading Bacillus sp. was isolated from compost ( 18). 
In another study, several strains of aquatic and terrestrial bacteria which degraded 
poly(ethylene succinate) that belong to the order Bacillales were isolated, but these 
showed limited or no degradation of PBS. PBS exhibited poorer biodegradation behavior 
than other aliphatic polymers, such as PCL ( 19) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) ( 20, 
21). In a study comparing the microbial communities that colonize different types of 
plastics in seawater, PBS showed very little colonization by microorganisms compared to 
polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate and Mater-Bi (22).
Biodegradation of PBS in natural water has been assessed in recent studies, mostly 
under laboratory conditions. PBS blown films were completely degraded within 50–60 
days in natural seawater and sand-containing tanks under laboratory conditions ( 23). In 
another study, PBS films showed negligible degradation in brackish water under in vitro 
conditions within 56 days (24). Other studies have also shown that the biodegradation of 
PBS in natural water samples is very slow (21, 25).
The enzymes that degrade PBS are predominantly cutinases ( 14, 26, 27). Cutinases 
are serine esterases that belong to the α/β hydrolase family ( 28). They degrade cutin, a 
waxy polyester on the surface of higher plants ( 28–30). Some cutinase-like enzymes can 
degrade synthetic polymers, including the aromatic polyester poly(ethylene terephtha­
late) (PET) ( 31–34). The substrate range depends on the enzyme. For example, some 
polyester-degrading esterases can degrade a range of different aliphatic polyesters, 
such as PBS, PLA, and PCL ( 35, 36). The PET-degrading enzyme (PETase) from Ideonella 
sakaiensis 201-F6 degrades a range of aromatic polymers, but cannot degrade aliphatic 
polymers ( 8). In contrast, Cutinase 1 from Thermobifida cellulosilytica  can degrade 
both PET and aliphatic polymers, including PBS ( 7). In addition to cutinases, PBS and 
derivatives can also be degraded by some fungal (37, 38) and bacterial (39) lipases.
In this study, we have enriched a marine microbial community that is capable of 
using PBS as the only carbon source. In addition to PBS, the enriched culture was grown 
on the films of PCL, which was shown to degrade in the marine environment ( 21, 25) 
and ecovio FT, a PBAT-based blended biodegradable plastic which was shown to be 
degraded by a marine microbial consortium ( 40). The culture was capable of degrad­
ing all plastics tested. Analyzing the biofilm community on the plastic and the free-liv­
ing community in the culture supernatant with metagenomics and metaproteomics 
separately, we determined the microbial community composition and the differences 
between communities growing on different plastics. We discovered genes/enzymes that 
potentially play a role in the degradation of the plastics investigated in this study. In 
addition, we have recombinantly expressed and verified the functions of three plastic 
degrading enzymes using HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS. This study let us identify the role of 
polymer type in shaping the microbial community degrading plastics and identify the 
enzymes involved in the degradation.

RESULTS
Degradation activity of the enriched community on ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL
The ability of the enriched culture to use ecovio FT, PBS, or PCL plastics as sole carbon 
sources was tested through mineralization tests. We observed that the culture was 
especially active when PBS or PCL was supplied as the carbon source. The enriched 
culture could convert 77.8 ± 8% of the initial carbon content supplied in the PBS films 
into CO 2 (Fig. 1 ) already after 15 days of incubation. In contrast, the enriched culture 
converted less carbon to CO2 when PCL was supplied as the carbon source (51.4 ± 16.3% 
after 24 days of incubation). When PBS was supplied as the carbon source, the enriched 
culture could already convert 50% of the initial carbon content after 8 days of incubation. 
This indicates that PBS is degraded more rapidly than PCL by the enriched culture.
The enriched culture was able to mineralize less of the ecovio FT than PBS and PCL. It 
could convert only about 29 ± 5.7% of the initial carbon content into CO 2, which took 33 
days.
The characterization of the enriched culture community
The metagenomes of the community growing on ecovio FT, PBS, or PCL were assem­
bled, binned, and taxonomically classified. The metagenome binning resulted in 35 
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of medium- (>75% completeness; n = 6) to 
high-quality (>95% completeness; n = 29 bins) with <3.5% contamination (Table S1). 
The most representative class of bacteria within the metagenomes were Alphaproteo­
bacteria with 54.3% and Gammaproteobacteria with 14.3% of the total community. 
Other less common bacteria were Bacteroidia (8.6%) and Actinomycetia (5.6%). At the 
genus level, the most representative was Sulfitobacter sp. (PC bin 7, bin 9, and bin 38), 
followed by Marinobacter sp. (bin 43 and bin 48), Thalassobius sp. (PB bin 16 and bin 
47), and Amylibacter sp. (bin 29 and bin 43). The complete breakdown of the taxonomic 
distribution of the community can be found in Fig. S1 through S5.
Differential gene abundance was determined by calculating log2 fold changes of 
genes found in the plastic film­attached fraction in comparison to the bacteria in 
the suspension (free-living). Additionally, MAGs were screened for enzymes that could 
potentially be involved in plastic degradation. Within this group, we identified 55 
esterases, α/β-hydrolases, PETase-like enzymes (Ple), and lipases in total. Within the

measurement was made in three replicates. Error bars depict standard deviation. No CO 2 formation was 
observed when polymers were incubated without the enriched culture.

microbial community, Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) and Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) synthesized 
the highest number of enzymes of interest.
The relative abundance of each MAG was calculated for the different plastics tested. 
Among the film­attached bacteria that grew on PBS or PCL, the most abundant species 
was Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) with 59.4% and 70.2% relative abundance, respectively 
(Fig. 2). On the ecovio FT film, the most abundant MAG was an Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24; 
42% relative abundance), followed by Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31; 25.5% relative abun­
dance). Interestingly, the abundance of Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) on PBS (1.8% relative 
abundance) decreased almost sixfold compared to PCL (10.5%), where it was the second 
most abundant species. In the free-living fraction of PBS, the most abundant bacterium 
was Thalassobius sp. (bin 47) with 47.7% relative abundance. In the cultures amended 
with ecovio FT, two species belonging to the Rhizobiaceae family (bin 21) and Roseivirga 
sp. (PB bin 40) were highly enriched in the free-living fraction (27.2 and 23.2% relative 
abundance, respectively). These two bacteria (bin 21 and PB bin 40) were unique to the 
free-living fractions of ecovio FT cultures, and therefore not detected in the biofilms. 
The most abundant bacterium in the free-living fractions of the culture growing on PCL 
was also Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31), and its relative abundance was similar to that of the 
attached-living fraction (65.71%). In addition, two species of Sulfitobacter sp. (PC bin 7 
and bin 9), Snethiella sp. (bin 17), and Amylibacter sp (bin 29) were present in similar 
relative abundance in all but one culture. Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) and Thalassobius sp. 
(bin 47) were also ubiquitous and had the highest abundance when the culture grew 
on PBS. Apart from the aforementioned Rhizobiaceae (bin 21), six other species were 
detected exclusively when the enriched culture grew on ecovio FT, four of which were 
present only in the free-living fraction. The only other plastic­specific species detected 
was Marinobacter sp. (PB bin 43) in the biofilm on PCL.
Bacterial activity based on protein synthesis
After analyzing protein formation on the film­attached bacteria supplied with one of the 
tested plastics, we observed that most proteins were synthesized by the two species, 
Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) and Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24). Surprisingly, PBS seems to trigger 
the activity of Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31), as more than half of the total synthesized 
proteins (~63%) ( Fig. 3 ) were released by this species. Compared to Pseudomonas sp. 
(bin 31), the rest of the community was less active (<6% of synthesized proteins). When 
the enriched culture was supplied with ecovio FT or PCL, the activity of Pseudomonas 
sp. (bin 31) and Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) was almost equal. In the presence of ecovio 
FT, Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) produced 32.6% of the proteins and Alcanivorax sp. (bin 
24) produced 22.3%. In the presence of PCL, 25.3% and 23.1% of the proteins were 
produced by Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) and Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24), respectively. Other 
biofilm­active bacteria included a species of Thalassobius sp. (bin 47) and Amylibacter sp. 
(bin 29). They produced between 5% and 10% of proteins under different conditions, 
although Thalassobius sp. (bin 47) was less active in the presence of PCL (3.36% proteins 
formed). Conversely, Thalassobius sp. (bin 47) was the most active bacterium in the 
free-living fractions (22.21% proteins formed).
In the free-living fractions, the soluble degradation products of ecovio FT degrada­
tion mainly stimulated the activity of a Rhizobiaceae species (bin 21; ~21% of proteins 
formed) and some other bacteria such as Marinibacterium sp. (bin 35; ~14% of proteins 
formed). Sulfitobacter sp. (PC bin 7), Roseivirga sp. (PB bin 40), Thalassobious sp. (bin 47), 
and Nisaea sp. (bin 30) were also reasonably active by forming between 5% and 10% of 
synthesized proteins. Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) showed some activity (4.61% of proteins 
formed), while Alcanivorax sp. did not appear to play a significant role in this fraction 
(<1% of proteins formed).
Similar to the effect observed when ecovio FT was supplied as a substrate, the 
PBS triggered the activity of Marinibacterium sp. (bin 35; ~20% of proteins formed), 
and it was the most active bacterium in the free-living fraction. Other active bacteria 
were Sulfitobacter sp. (PC bin 7), Amilybacter sp. (bin 29), and Thalassobius sp. (bin 47),

contributing 5–10% of proteins formed. In this case, Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) showed to 
have some activity (4.5% proteins formed) and Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) was less active 
(~1% of proteins formed). Collectively, this suggests that Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) may 
play an important role in biofilm formation, the degradation of PBS, or both.
Synthesis of other proteins of interest
A total of 12,235 protein groups were detected in the metaproteomes of the cultures 
exposed to ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL films. Of these proteins, we detected the formation 
(at least two times) of 9,939 proteins in ecovio FT cultures (81.2%), 9,913 proteins in PBS 
cultures (81.0%), and 8,752 proteins (71.5%) in PCL cultures (Fig. S6). Among the three 
conditions, ecovio FT promoted higher differential expression of synthesized microbial 
proteins between the fraction adhered to the polymer film and the free-living fraction. 
Of the total amount of proteins produced in the presence of ecovio FT, the two fractions 
accounted for only 59%. In contrast, PBS and PCL shared ~72% of the proteins between 
the fraction adhered to the film and the free-living fraction.
In the film­attached and free-living fractions of the ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL-exposed 
communities, the most frequently synthesized proteins were transporters (ko02000), 
ribosomal proteins (ko03011), and proteins belonging to two-component systems 
(ko02022) (Fig. S7). Other proteins that were highly abundant were proteins involved

presence of an α/β hydrolase (purple), esterase (yellow), lipase (magenta), or Ples (light blue) found in a bin and that was significantly found in the film­attached 
fraction (shown as “F” in red), free-living fraction (shown as “S” in blue) or both fractions (shown as “S/F” in blue and red, respectively). MAGs are additionally 
clustered and highlighted by the following groups: Gammaproteobacteria (soft purple), Alphaproteobacteria (soft blue), Terrabacteria (soft blue) clade, and 
FCB clade (soft pink). The numbers on the branches represent bootstrap values. The phylogenetic tree was created by using the UBCG pipeline and default 
parameters (https://www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/ubcg) and rooted with a midpoint root.

in oxidative phosphorylation (ko00190), purine metabolism (ko00230), the citrate cycle 
(ko00020), and glycolysis (ko00010). We also detected additional metabolic pathways 
and proteins of interest that were less abundant but clearly produced both in the 
film­attached or free-living fraction. For example, proteins involved in secretion systems 
(ko02044) and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (ko02025) were produced 
mainly in the film­attached fractions of the enriched cultures amended with ecovio 
FT and PBS (Fig. S7). The production of several proteins required for quorum sensing 
(ko02024) increased in free-living fractions of cultures supplied with PCL.
Identification and abundance of Ples
Functional analysis of the metagenomes of ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL-exposed enrichment 
culture revealed several cutinases, lipases, esterases, and α/β-hydrolases potentially 
involved in the degradation of the plastic films. From these candidate genes, we selected 
55 genes (Table S3) based on their protein synthesis ( ≥1 or ≤−1 of fold-change for 
upregulated or downregulated proteins, respectively) and significance ( P value ≤ 0.05) 
either in the free-living or film­attached fractions of the enriched culture growing with 
ecovio FT, PBS, or PCL films. Three sequences of the most upregulated proteins that 
were also common to cultures growing with the different plastic films were retrieved 
and codon optimized for recombinant expression. These genes were named “ ple-tan1,” 
“ple-tan2, ” and “ple-solo. ”
The ple-tan1, ple-tan2, and ple-solo genes were more abundant in the metagenomes 
of the biofilm on ecovio FT and PBS than in the metagenomes of the PCL biofilm. Also, 
the protein Ple-tan1 was detected only on ecovio FT and PBS films, while both Ple-tan2 
and Ple-solo formed in the film­attached communities of all polymers. However, the 
fold changes of protein formation were higher on the ecovio FT film than on the other 
plastics (Fig. 4).
Other genes associated with PETases were more abundant in enriched cultures 
containing ecovio FT and PBS ( Fig. 4 ). When comparing fold changes of individual 
genes between the attached and free-living fractions, genes from Alcanivorax sp. (bin 
24) showed a higher fold change in gene abundance in the biofilm of ecovio FT than on 
PBS, with a reverse trend for genes belonging to Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31). In addition, 
the esterase EstB137 from Sulfitobacter sp. (bin 9) was exclusively detected in the ecovio 
FT enriched cultures. In the presence of PCL, four hydrolases and one lipase belonging 
to Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) were more abundant on the biofilm. Additionally, Lip528 of 
Marinobacter sp. (PB bin 43) and Hyd195 of Sulfitobacter sp. (PC bin 7) also had increased 
relative gene abundances. The production of the selected enzymes of interest was more 
heterogeneous compared to their gene abundances.
Ple purification and identification
The genes ple-tan1, ple-tan2, and ple-solo were all present in the Pseudomonas sp. (bin 
31) genome. The ple-tan1 and ple-tan2 genes were found to be in a tandem configura­
tion with no other open reading frames in between, whereas ple-solo was identified on 
a separate contig. The Ple-tan1 and Ple-tan2 are phylogenetically related, while Ple-solo 
seems to belong to a different cluster (Fig. S8). These three enzymes are similar to 
several cutinases from Marinobacter and Pseudomonas species. Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and 
Ple-solo have 53%, 54%, and 48% amino acid identity, respectively, to the Ideonella 
sakaiensis PETase (A0A0K8P6T7, IsPETase). They are also closely related (61–66% amino 
acid identity) to the previously identified Ple628 and Ple629, which were identified from 
another marine consortium ( 40). In addition, we observed that Ple-tan1 and Ple-tan2 
have an amino acid identity of 84.1%, while both have only 69% identity to Ple-solo.
To evaluate their activities, we successfully expressed the Ples recombinantly. The 
theoretical molecular weight of the Ples is 32.5 kD. The molecular weight of the 
expressed Ples corresponds to their theoretical molecular weight. The calculated yield

after purification was 58.32, 18.56, and 33.28 mg for Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo in 1 L 
cell culture, respectively.
We investigated the temperature range in which the three Ples are most active by 
incubating them at different temperatures with ecovio FT as the substrate and measur­
ing the formation of terephthalate-butanediol monoester (BT) and terephthalic acid (T). 
Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo had the highest amounts of the ecovio FT degradation 
products, BT + T, after 48 h of incubation. The highest amounts of BT + T were produced 
at 20°C for the three enzymes, and decreased significantly at 40°C and 50°C (Fig. S5). 
Ple-tan1 was the most active of the three Ples even when incubated at 40°C. At 20°C, 
Ple-tan1 formed 611.3 ± 34.2 µM of BT + T after 48 h of incubation and at 40°C, the 
amount of BT + T decreased by 17.5% (106.9 ± 9.8 µM of BT + T). In contrast, Ple-tan2 and 
Ple-solo were more sensitive to higher temperatures and produced only 21.5 ± 1.1 and 
18.1 ± 0.5 µM of BT + T, respectively, at 40°C after 48 h of incubation. The shift from 40°C 
to 50°C did not negatively affect the activity of Ple-tan2 and Ple-solo any further, while 
the activity of Ple-tan1 decreased considerably to 32% (relative to the amount of BT + T 
formed at 40°C after 48 h).
Michaelis-Menten of Ples with pNPB
Catalytic constant ( kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constant ( Km) values were calculated by 
measuring the activity of Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo (0.005 µg/µL; 0.15385 µM) on 
para-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) at 20°C. To calculate the Michaelis-Menten parameters, 
we tested different concentrations of pNPB (from 100 to 2,400 µM). The highest kcat 
(386.19 s−1) was observed for Ple-tan2, followed by Ple-tan1 (142 s −1), while Ple-solo had 
the lowest kcat (0.12 s−1). The Km was estimated as 454 ± 54, 1417 ± 94, and 254 ± 55 µM 
for Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo, respectively.
Ple activity and product formation after ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL degradation
Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo were able to hydrolyze all polymers tested. The ecovio 
FT was primarily degraded to BT. The T production was less than 10% of the total 
products in each case. After 48 h, Ple-tan2 and Ple-solo produced similar amounts of 
total products, while Ple-tan1 produced two times the amount of either enzyme ( Fig. 
5). Because the degradation products of PCL and PBS are not UV active, they were 
detected using LC-MS. The degradation products of PBS were oligomers of Su and B. 
After 48 h, Ple-tan1 produced the largest amount of the monoester SuB (succinic acid + 
1,4-butanediol) and the diesters BSuB (1,4-butanediol + succinic acid + 1,4-butanediol) 
and SuBSu (succinic acid + 1,4-butanediol + succinic acid), followed by Ple-solo. The 
monomer Su was not detected due to rapid elution from the column. B was detected 
mainly in the samples treated with Ple-solo after 48 h. When PCL was used as substrate, 
Ple-solo again produced the largest amount of the monomer 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid 
(6OHhexanoic acid), followed by Ple-tan2 and Ple-tan1 (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
The effects of plastic type on microbial community composition and activity
Of all three plastics, PBS and PCL showed a high percentage of mineralization. The 
degradation of ecovio FT not only took longer under the tested conditions, but the 
overall conversion to CO 2 was also lower. This is likely due to its terephthalate moiet­
ies, as the original culture was enriched on an aliphatic polyester, and we could not

detect terephthalate degradation gene clusters in the metagenomes (Fig. S2). Thus, 
this community is able to partially degrade but not fully mineralize this polymer. The 
downstream degradation products of PBS and PCL, on the other hand, do not have the 
terephthalate moiety and are readily degradable by a wide range of microorganisms.
In each experiment, the type of plastic polymer added as a carbon source resulted in 
changes in the microbial community composition. This is best seen in the high number 
of MAGs detected exclusively when culturing with ecovio FT compared to experiments 
with PBS and PCL, especially within the free-living fraction. This is probably because a 
broader spectrum of degradation products is released during the degradation of ecovio 
FT compared to PBS and PCL, resulting in the enrichment of a greater diversity of 
microorganisms that can consume these products.
The biofilm communities on all plastic films were dominated by either Alcanivorax 
sp. (bin 24), Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31), or Thalassobius sp. (bin 47). Alcanivorax is well 
known for its ability to degrade aliphatic polyesters including PCL ( 20, 41, 42) and 
recently also was reported to degrade low-density polyethylene ( 41). Members of genus 
Pseudomonas have also been reported to degrade a wide range of plastic polymers 
including low-density polyethylene (43), high-density polyethylene (44), polystyrene (20), 
and polyester polyurethane ( 20, 41, 43–45). In this study, both strains carried genes 
encoding proteins that were either putative plastic-degrading enzymes, or enzymes 
that were proven in this study to degrade all three polyesters. In accordance with the 
abundance data, gammaproteobacterial members Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) and Pseudo­
monas sp. (bin 31) had more upregulated proteins and were thus more active on the 
biofilm. It is likely that Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) and Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) are the 
primary plastic degraders of the consortium. The role of Pseudomonas sp. (bin 31) was 
further confirmed by the purification and characterization of the three novel Ples. Several 
FIG 5 Hydrolysis of ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL by Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo. For each plastic type, the smallest peak area for each degradation product 
across all experiments was assigned as one. The ratios represent the fold change from the smallest peak area across all experiments. The products SuB (succinic 
acid + 1,4-butanediol), SuBSu (succinic acid + 1,4-butanediol + succinic acid) and BSuB (1,4-butanediol + succinic acid + 1,4-butanediol) were detected from PBS 
(blue line) growing cultures; 6OH hexanoic acid (6-hydroxyhexanoic acid) was detected from PCL (gray line) growing cultures and BT (terephthalate-butanediol 
monoester) and T (terephthalic acid) were detected from ecovio FT (red line) growing cultures. Each ratio was calculated using the average of three replicates.

other marine Gammaproteobacteria such as Shewanella sp. CT01, and Moritella spp. CT12 
and JT01 degrading PCL ( 20) and a Marinobacter sp. from another ecovio FT-degrading 
marine enrichment ( 40, 46) were previously documented, demonstrating the capability 
of certain marine Gammaproteobacteria to degrade plastics.
The role of the alphaproteobacterial members of the community is less clear. MAGs 
such as Amylibacter sp. (bin 29), Marinibacterium sp. (bin 35), and Rhizobiaceae (bin 
21) had more upregulated proteins in the free-living fractions. The observation that 
Alphaproteobacteria are more active in the free-living fractions of plastic degrading 
cultures was previously made for another marine consortium that grew on ecovio FT 
(40). We propose that these species consume the oligomeric or monomeric degradation 
products, which are released to the culture supernatant.
Thalassobius sp. (bin 47), the most abundant organism in the consortium when 
PBS was supplied as a substrate, has not yet been described to degrade plastic. 
However, it has been reported to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( 47) and 
phthalate esters ( 48). Although this microorganism was abundant, we did not detect 
a clear difference in the protein abundance profiles of this microorganism between 
the biofilm and free-living fraction, showing that this organism is similarly active in 
both fractions. At the moment, the role of this microorganism in plastic degradation is 
unclear. The presence of α/β-hydrolases and esterases in the genome, in conjunction 
with the high abundance of this organism in the PBS biofilm, suggests that it could be 
actively degrading PBS. However, the high number of upregulated proteins, including 
the hydrolases and esterases, in the free-living fractions suggests that the organism is 
more specialized towards consuming the soluble degradation products.
Characterization of the novel Ples
The activities of the characterized Ples on ecovio FT were lower than those of the 
previously identified marine PETase Ple629, but higher than that of Ple628 ( 46). The Ple 
with the highest activity, Ple-tan1, formed about 70% of the total degradation products 
of Ple629 after 48 h, while Ple-tan2 and Ple-solo formed 50% and 30%, respectively. 
Similarly, for the polymeric substrates, the difference between the Ple-tan1/Ple-tan2 
tandem pair was not as drastic as between Ple628/Ple629, with Ple628 forming about 
10-fold fewer degradation products than Ple629 ( 46). Although Ple-solo showed the 
lowest activity on p-NPB and ecovio FT, it had the highest activity on PCL, and the 
second-highest activity on PBS. The presence of several different esterases with different 
substrate ranges and efficiencies may give the microorganism the ability to degrade a 
broad range of polymers.
Although Ple-solo had the lowest activity on ecovio FT, it was more highly upregula­
ted on this film compared to the other polymers. Cutinases and cutinase-like enzymes 
have been previously reported to be induced and expressed differentially within the 
same organism ( 46, 49, 50). Their expression can be constitutive or induced by the 
degradation products. It is possible that the degradation products of ecovio FT induce 
Ple-solo, despite its lower efficiency.
Conclusions
Using a combination of cultivation, metagenomics, metaproteomics, and recombinant 
gene expression, we investigated the role of plastic type in shaping the composition of 
a marine-enriched culture that can degrade biodegradable plastic blends. Our findings 
show that plastic type influences microbial community composition, particularly in the 
free-living bacterial communities that consume the soluble degradation products. Our 
results also suggest that the marine ecosystem harbors microorganisms and enzymes 
capable of degrading a range of polyesters with different compositions and properties. 
This study provides evidence that Alcanivorax sp. (bin 24) and Pseudomonas sp. (bin 
31) are relevant plastic degraders in marine environments, and the cutinases Ple-tan1, 
Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo have been shown to degrade PBS, PCL, and PBAT polymer blends.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection
Seawater and coastal aerobic sediment for samples were collected from List/Sylt 
Germany (55°01 ′30.5″N 8°25 ′53.0″E) in June 2019. Samples were stored in the dark at 
4°C until use.
Reagents
The ecovio FT foil, a blend of PBAT and PBSeT (poly (butylene-sebacate– co–terephtha­
late)), was supplied by BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany), PBS was supplied by PTT MCC 
Biochem, Thailand, and PCL was supplied by Futation (Denmark).
The ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL films were sterilized by submersion in 70% ethanol for 
20 min. After this time, the plastic foils were removed with sterile tweezers and placed on 
open sterile Petri dishes to air dry aseptically.
Culture conditions
All cultivations were carried out in a mineral medium M13a (DSM media no. 600a) with 
some modifications: Artificial seawater (ASW 1×), Hutner’s salts and metals solutions 
were prepared according to DSMZ 590 medium. The carbon and nitrogen sources 
described for these media (600a. M13a and 590 DSMZ media) were replaced by NH 4Cl 
(1 mM) and K2HPO4 (0.1 mM).
The enrichment was performed as previously described ( 40). Briefly, 1 g of sediment 
was mixed with 10 mL of seawater and vortexed at top speed for 30 s to dislocate the 
cells from the sediment. After letting the mixture settle briefly, 1 mL of the supernatant 
was used to inoculate sterile 50 mL of mineral medium in a 250-mL flask, supplemented 
with a 5 × 5 cm 2 PBS film, and 0.1% yeast extract. The cultures were incubated in a MaxQ 
4000 orbital shaker (Fisher Scientific, Germany) at 22°C, 120 rpm. After disintegration of 
the film was observed (ca. 2 months), 1 mL of the culture was transferred into a flask with 
the same amount of fresh medium and PBS film as before, omitting the yeast extract. The 
procedure was repeated until a stably degrading culture was obtained.
Mineralization assays
To measure mineralization of ecovio FT, PBS, and PCL, a pre-culture was prepared 
consisting of 1 mL pregrown enriched culture, supplied with a 5 × 5 cm 2 PBS film. The 
pre-culture was grown with 50 mL of mineral media in a 300-mL Erlenmeyer flask and 
incubated at 20°C, 120 rpm in a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaker (Fisher Scientific, Germany). 
Pre-cultures were then diluted to 1:10 with mineral media and 1 mL of the dilution was 
inoculated in 25 mL of mineral media supplied with 1 mg carbon/L of either ecovio FT, 
PBS, or PCL. Each mineralization flask (250 mL volume) included an external CO 2 trap 
containing 4 mL NaOH (0.1 mM). The purpose of the trap was to measure mineralization 
through the analysis of CO 2 formation. Each condition consisted of three replicates 
inoculated with bacteria and supplied with either of the plastic films. Negative controls 
were prepared also in triplicate and consisted only of cultures without the carbon source. 
The cultures were incubated in a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaker (Fisher Scientific, Germany) at 
22°C, 120 rpm. The tests were run until no further mineralization was detected. This was 
15 days for PBS, 24 for PCL, and 39 for ecovio FT.
The entrapped CO 2 was removed and diluted 10× with Milli-Q water in TOC glass 
vials. The carbon content was then quantified by using a calibration curve of NaHCO 3. 
The CO 2 formed in the mineralization assays was measured as inorganic carbon using 
a TOC-L analyzer and data collection was retrieved by using the TOC-Control L v.1.06 
software (Shimadzu, Japan).

DNA and protein extraction, purification, and quantification
For DNA and protein extraction, 1 mL of pre-culture was inoculated to 99 mL of marine 
mineral media supplied with 5 × 5 cm 2 films of either ecovio FT, PBS, or PCL. Each 
condition consisted of four replicates. The cultures were incubated at 20°C, 120 rpm in 
a MaxQ 4000 orbital shaker (Fisher Scientific, Germany). Before film disintegration, the 
cultures were harvested by filtering the whole content of each flask through a 50 µM 
sieve, which was previously sterilized with ethanol. The free-living bacterial fraction 
of each culture was collected with clean beaker flasks placed under the sieve and 
transferred to clean 50 mL Falcon tubes. Each plastic film (attached bacterial fraction) 
retained on the sieve was washed 3× with Milli-Q water. Subsequently, the plastic films 
were separately transferred to sterile Petri dishes and submerged in 5 mL of phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.4. While submerged, biofilms were scratched out of each plastic film with 
clean scalpels. The suspended biofilms were homogenized by pipetting and transferred 
to sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes. Free-living and attached fractions were centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were then stored at −80°C. Finally, DNA and proteins 
were extracted from both fractions simultaneously with the Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep 
Plus Kit (Zymo Research, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The integrity of the isolated DNA was analyzed in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized 
with the Intas Gel v.0.2.14 software. Before sequencing, RNA contamination was removed 
from the DNA samples with RNase A (AppliChem, Germany). The quality of DNA was 
additionally analyzed by measuring the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios via Nanodrop by 
using the Nanodrop 2000 v.1.5 software (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
The fractions of proteins isolated with Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo 
Research, USA) were further precipitated with acetone according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The concentration of the purified proteins as well as DNA were measured 
by using Qubit Protein Assay and Qubit dsDNA BR kits, respectively, and measured on a 
Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, USA).
DNA sequencing
The DNA sequencing library was generated from 200 ng DNA using NEBNext Ultra 
II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs, USA) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocols including PCR Amplification with five cycles. The library was 
treated with Illumina Free Adapter Blocking and was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 
6000 using NovaSeq 6000 S1 PE Reagent Kit (300 cycles) with an average of 3 × 10 7 reads 
per DNA sample.
Metaproteomics by nanoLC-MS/MS
The metaproteome samples were processed and analyzed as previously described ( 40). 
The protein precipitates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, loaded on an 
SDS-gel and run for 10 min. The gel pieces were cut, washed, and incubated with 25 mM 
1,4-dithiothreitol (in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 1 h and 100 mM iodoacetamide 
(in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 30 min. The gel pieces were further destained, 
dehydrated, and proteolytically cleaved overnight at 37°C with trypsin (Promega, 
Germany). The peptide lysates were extracted and desalted using ZipTip-C18 tips (Merck 
Millipore, Germany). Afterward, the peptide lysates were re-suspended in 0.1% formic 
acid and injected to a nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). 
Thus, the mass spectrometric analyses of peptide lysates were performed on a Q Exactive 
HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled with a TriVersa NanoMate 
(Advion, Ltd., UK) source in LC chip coupling mode. LC gradient, ionization mode, and 
mass spectrometry mode have been used as described before (51).
Data resulting from nanoLC-MS/MS analysis were analyzed using the Proteome 
Discoverer v.2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using the SEQUEST HT algorithm. As 
a FASTA database, the protein-coding sequences of the metagenome ( n = 164,604 
sequences) were used. Search settings were set to trypsin (Full), max. missed cleavage: 2, 
precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da. The false discovery

rates (FDRs) were determined with the node Percolator ( 52) embedded in Proteome 
Discoverer and the FDR threshold was set at a peptide level of <1%. The same threshold 
was set for the protein FDR.
Ple extraction, detection, and purification
The synthetic gene constructs were manufactured, codon optimized, and cloned into 
the pCold II by BioCat GmbH, Germany. Cells of Escherichia coli  Origami (DE3) (Merck, 
Germany) were chemically transformed with pCold II vectors containing ple-tan1, 
ple-tan2, and ple-solo. The transformants were plated on Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar with 
100 µg/mL of ampicillin plates.
Expression of the Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo was carried out by transferring the 
2 mL pre-cultures to 500 mL Terrific Broth medium supplied with 50 µg/mL of ampicillin 
in 2 L baffled flasks. The cultures were incubated at 37°C, 120 rpm until an OD of 0.8–1.0 
was reached. The cultures were cooled down on ice for 15 min and induced with 0.5 mM 
IPTG. Induced cultures were then incubated at 16°C, at 120 rpm in a MaxQ 4000 orbital 
shaker (Fisher Scientific, Germany) overnight.
Induced cultures were harvested the next day in an Avanti J-26 XPI centrifuge with a 
JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 6,000 × g, 4°C for 5 min. The pellets were frozen 
at −20°C for 20 min and resuspended in 50 mL of a Wash/Load buffer (50 mM NaH 2PO4 
× 2 H 2O, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and 1 µL of Pierce Universal Nuclease for Cell Lysis 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cells were placed on ice and disrupted with a Sonopuls 
HD2070 sonicator366 (Bandelin, Germany) at 50% amplitude for 2.5 min two times with a 
1 min break. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, 4°C for 30 min in an Avanti J-26 XPI 
centrifuge with a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter, USA) and filter sterilized with a 0.2 µM 
filter.
Pooled supernatants were further purified on a 5 mL cOmplete His-Tag Purification 
Column (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) connected to an ÄKTA Start Purification System (Cytiva, 
Germany). For protein elution, an elution buffer consisting of 50 mM NaH 2PO4 × 2 H 2O, 
300 mM NaCl and 250 mM Imidazole at pH 8.0 with a 1 mL/min flow rate was used. The 
elution buffer was used in a gradient between 5% and 100%. The Ples were eluted at 
12% of the gradient. About 3 mL of Ple-tan1, 1 mL of Ple-tan2 and Ple-solo were eluted.
About 10 µL of the fractions was loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and ran for 1 h at 
25 V/cm in a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The presence of Ples 
was detected by comparing the bands to a protein size standard (Precision Plus Protein 
Unstained Standards, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Pure fractions were further pooled 
together, buffer exchanged with PBS and concentrated on a Pierce Protein Concentra­
tor PES 10K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
The Ples that presented contamination by other proteins were further purified by 
size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Cytiva, 
Germany) connected to an ÄKTA Start Purification System (Cytiva, Germany) in a buffer 
consisting of 25 mM Tris–HCl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The Ples tan1 and solo which 
presented contamination by other proteins were further purified by size exclusion. 
Previous to the purification by size exclusion, Ple-tan1 and Ple-solo were concentrated 
and buffer was exchanged after His-Tag purification by using a Pierce Protein Concen­
trator PES 10K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. After size exclusion purification, the proteins were further concentrated by 
using a Pierce Protein Concentrator PES 10K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The 
concentrations of the purified proteins were analyzed by using Qubit Protein Assay kits 
and quantified on a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, CA, USA).
Determination of enzyme optimum temperatures
The activities of Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo were tested at 20, 30, 40, and 50°C by 
measuring the formation of BT and T after degradation of ecovio FT. For the reaction, 
10 µg of each Ple was incubated with 5 mg of ecovio FT in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes 
Full-Length Text Applied and Environmental Microbiology
December 2023  Volume 89  Issue 12 10.1128/aem.01060-23 14
containing 500 µL of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Incubations were carried 
out at 300 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer C (Eppendorf, Germany) for 48 h. Two 
sampling points of 50 µL each were taken, after 24 and 48 h of incubation. The reactions 
were carried out in triplicates. Three negatives per temperature containing only the 
buffer and ecovio FT were also included in the assay.
BT and T were detected with a 1260 Infinity II LC System (Agilent Technologies, USA) 
and separated through an Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column (Agilent Technolo­
gies, USA) as described before ( 46). The separation was performed with a gradient of 
acetonitrile 99.9% HPLC grade (Fisher Scientific, USA) and 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid (98–
100% Suprapur, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in Milli-Q water. The flow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min. 
About 1 µL of the sample was injected. Acetonitrile was increased from 5% to 44% until 
minute 12 and then to 70% at minute 15 remaining constant for another 3 min. BT and T 
formation was detected at 240 nm after elution times of 16.3 and 7.5 min, respectively.
Ples enzymatic assays on ecovio FT, PCL, PBS, and pNPB
The activities of Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo were additionally analyzed with ecovio 
FT, PCL, and PBS as the substrate. For the reaction, 0.02 µg/µL of enzyme was incubated 
with 5 mg of either ecovio FT, PCL, and PBS in 500 µL of ammonium acetate buffer 
(40 mM), pH 7.4. The reactions were incubated at the Ples optimum temperature, 20°C, 
at 300 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer C (Eppendorf, Germany). Incubations lasted 
48 h and two sampling points were taken, after 24 and 48 h. Reactions without the 
enzymes were used as negative controls. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Product 
formation was qualitatively analyzed by either HPLC (ecovio FT reactions) as described 
previously or LC-MS (PCL and PBS reactions).
The ecovio FT reactions were then transferred to standard HPLC vials. BT, BHBT, and 
T were detected as described previously ( 46). The HPLC-MS analysis of the PBS and PCL 
degradation products was made as previously described (46).
Km and kcat were determined for Ple-tan1, Ple-tan2, and Ple-solo by measuring 
4-nitrophenol after the hydrolysis of pNPB. For the reaction, different concentrations 
of pNPB (0.1–2.4 mM) were mixed with 0.005 µg/µL of enzyme in 60 µL of PBS, 
pH 7.4. Incubations were carried out in 96-well plates and at room temperature in a 
TECAN Infinite M200 plate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). Measurements were performed 
every 5 min for 1 h, at 405 nm and results were retrieved using the TECAN i-control 
v.1.5.14.0 software (TECAN, Switzerland). Standard curves were prepared by measur­
ing the different concentrations of 4-nitrophenol dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4 buffer, and 
incubated under the same conditions as the enzymatic assays. Reactions without the 
enzymes were used as negative controls. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Km, 
Vmax, and kcat were determined by nonlinear least squares regression ( http://biomo­
del.uah.es/en/metab/enzimas/MM-regresion.htm, last accessed 04.04.2022).
Data analysis
Processing and assembly of metagenome sequence data
Raw read metagenome sequences were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmo­
matic v0.39 ( 53), followed by removal of PhiX sequencing control reads using BBMap 
v38.90 (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/). The quality-checked 
paired-end reads were then error corrected using the “Tadpole.sh” workflow implemen­
ted in BBMAP with the options “cc = t rollback = t pincer = t tail = t prefilter = t prealloc 
= t mode = correct. ” The quality of the sequenced reads in all these steps was assessed 
using FASTQC (54). Finally, the high-quality reads were independently assembled using 
metaSPAdes v3.15.2 (55) with preset metagenomic options and a Kmer range of 21–127. 
Contigs longer than 500 bp were retained for downstream analyses.

Genome-resolved metagenomic binning
The resulting size­filtered metagenomic contigs were mapped against the corresponding 
error-corrected metagenomic reads using BBMap v38.90 ( https://github.com/BioInfo­
Tools/BBMap) with default settings and the “pairedonly = t” option. The mean base 
coverage per contig was used for unsupervised metagenome-resolved genome binning 
using MetaBAT2 v2.12.1 ( 56) with the default settings and a minimum contig size of 
1.5 kbp. The quality of MAGs was assessed using CheckM v1.1.3 and v2.1.0 wwith the 
“lineage_wf” command. MAGs were taxonomically assigned with GTDB-Tk v1.3.0 ( 57) 
ususing the “classify_wf” command with default settings and GTDB database version 95 
(accessed 23 July2020) ( 58). The MAGs were dereplicated using dREP v3.2.2 ( 59) with 
default settings, resulting in a total of 35 representative MAGs for downstream analyses.
The abundance of these 35 MAGs was determined by mapping quality­filtered 
paired-end metagenomes. Genome-wide mapping was performed using CoverM v0.6.1 
(https://github.com/wwood/CoverM, last accessed 24.11.2022) against a concatenated 
nucleotide sequence of the 15 representative genomes, requiring a read length of 75% 
and an identity threshold of 95%. Abundance values were calculated by dividing the 
mean coverage of each MAG by the total coverage of all MAGs, followed by multiplying 
this proportion by the total number of mapped reads. Final relative abundance values 
were calculated as a proportion of the sum of the calculated abundances in a sample.
Generation of gene sequence catalog and abundance estimation
Putative protein-coding gene sequences were predicted from the filtered contigs using 
Program v2.6.3 ( 60) in the metagenomic mode (option: -p meta), retaining only genes 
that were predicted to have been complete, with defined codon boundaries (i.e., 
categorized as “partial = 00”). This yielded a total of 1,485,086 complete non-redundant 
genes.
The protein-coding gene sequences from all metagenomes were clustered into a 
non-redundant set of genes with mmseqs2 v4.6.1 ( 61) as described in Duarte et al. 
(62) based on the “easy-linclust” workflow, applying default settings and the following 
options: global sequence identity (--min-seq-id 0.95) and sequence length overlap of 
the shorter sequence (-c 0.80). Following this procedure, we obtained a total of 178,655 
complete non-redundant genes.
The abundance of these genes in the separate metagenomes was determined based 
on mapping the gene catalog separately against the high-quality metagenomes with 
BBMap v.V38.18. BBmap was performed using the following parameters: nodisk = t rpkm 
= $fpkm ambig = toss idfilter = 0.95 tossbrokenreads. This resulted in a common metric 
of normalized abundance of reads per kilobase million mapped reads (RPKM).
Differential gene abundance analyses
The analysis of differential gene abundances was performed based on number of reads 
mapped to genes corresponding to MAGs using DESeq2 (63). Only genes with a log2 fold 
change with a Padj ≤ 0.05 were considered. Comparisons were made between polymers 
between attached and free-living fractions of the replicate samples.
Metaproteome analysis
Metaproteomic quantification was performed by grouping the redundant proteins in 
protein groups with the strict parsimony principle. Those protein groups that explain 
at least one unique identified peptide were reported. The peptides that were not 
shared between different proteins or protein groups were used for the protein quantifi­
cation. Quantification of peptides was performed with the Top3 approach as part of 
the Proteome Discoverer v.1.4 (Fisher Scientific, USA) software. The resulting data were 
then log2-transformed and normalized. Normalization was carried out by dividing the 
log2-transformed values by the median of the sample and multiplying by the mean

December 2023  Volume 89  Issue 12 10.1128/aem.01060-23 16
of the entire data set as described before ( 64, 65). To determine protein synthesis in 
the film­attached and free-living fractions, we calculated fold changes of normalized 
values by subtracting the means of normalized film­attached triplicates to those of 
normalized free-living triplicates. Proteins synthesized only in the film­attached fractions, 
or presenting a fold change of ≥1, were considered to be upregulated proteins. Contrary, 
proteins synthesized only in the free-living fractions or presenting a fold change of 
≤−1, were considered to be downregulated proteins. The P values were calculated from 
two-tailed t test. Values with P values ≤0.05 were considered significant. Calculations 
were carried out by using Microsoft Excel 2010 v.14.0.7252.5000.
The replicate consistency was determined by analyzing the distribution of the 
normalized areas (Fig. S10). Clustering of the normalized areas to each condition (ecovio 
FT, PBS, or PCL) was calculated and visualized with ComplexHeatmap v.2.1.0 ( 66). Venn 
diagrams were produced by using the online tool InteractiVenn ( 67). KO identifiers 
assigned to each gene after metagenomics were used to assign a KEGG pathway to 
each up-regulated or downregulated protein. Pathways were collected and total count of 
proteins per pathway was performed and the results were visualized. All R packages were 
used with R v.3.6.0 (68). All tools were run with default parameters.
The phylogenetic tree of the bins was constructed using the online UBCG pipeline 
(69) and visualized with iTOL v.6 (70).
