Abstract
In some bacterial species and photosynthetic cohorts, including algae, the enzymeL,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapL)
(E.C. 2.6.1.83) is involved in the anabolism of the essential amino acid L-lysine. DapL catalyzes the conversion of
tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) to L,L-diaminopimelate (L,L-DAP), in one step bypassing the DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic
reactions present in the acyl DAP pathways. Here we present anin vivoand in vitrocharacterization of the DapL ortholog from the
alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(Cr-DapL). The in vivoanalysis illustrated that the enzyme is able to functionally complement the
E. coli dapauxotrophs and was essential for plant development in Arabidopsis. In vitro, the enzyme was able to inter-convert
THDPA and L,L-DAP, showing strong substrate specificity. Cr-DapL was dimeric in both solution and when crystallized. The
structure ofCr-DapL was solved in itsapo form, showing an overall architecture of aa/b protein with each monomer in the dimer
adopting a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase-like fold in a V-shaped conformation. The active site comprises residues
from both monomers in the dimer and shows some rearrangement when compared to theapo-DapL structure from Arabidopsis.
Since animals do not possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for thede novosynthesis of the amino acid L-lysine, enzymes
involved in this pathway are attractive targets for the development of antibiotics, herbicides and algaecides.

Introduction
The essential amino acid L-lysine (lys) is anabolized via two
evolutionary lineages that are divergent in nature. One pathway
uses the intermediatea-aminoadipic acid (AAA), which occurs in
yeast, fungi and in some species belonging to the kingdom archaea
[1,2]. The alternative pathway utilizes the intermediate diamino-
pimelic acid (DAP) and is present in most bacterial species and
photosynthetic cohorts.
To date, four variants of the DAP/lys pathway have been
identified: the two acyl pathways, which utilize succinylated or
acetylated intermediates; the meso-diaminopimelate ( meso-DAP)
dehydrogenase (Ddh) pathway, which has been identified in only a
few species thus far; and the recently discovered
L,L-diaminopi-
melate (L,L-DAP) aminotransferasae (DapL) pathway [3,4,5,6].
The DAP/lys pathway can be divided into three parts. The first
part of the pathway is the synthesis of tetrahydrodipicolinate
(THDPA) from the amino acid
L-aspartate (Figure 1). This feature is
common to all four variants. The conversion fromL-aspartate to
THDPA is facilitated by a series of reactions carried out by the
enzymes LysC, AsD, DapA, and DapB respectively [4]. The second
and central portion of the pathway, comprising the conversion of
THDPA to the penultimate intermediatemeso-DAP, distinguishes
the four variants. In the acyl pathways, four enzymes are needed for
this conversion to occur. These reactions are carried out by the
enzymes: DapD, DapC, DapE and DapF, respectively (Figure 1). In
the Ddh pathway, THDPA is converted tomeso-DAP by the enzyme
meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (Ddh), in one step bypassing
the DapD, DapC, DapE and DapF reactions [7].
Hudson et al. recently discovered the
L,L-diaminopimelate (L,L-
DAP) aminotransferase pathway[4]. In this pathway,L,L-DAP is
synthesized from THDPA in one step, using the amino acidL-
glutamate as an amino donor and THDPA as the amino acceptor,
bypassing the DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic steps that are
present in the acyl pathways (Figure 1).
The third and final step in the DAP/lys pathways is the
conversion ofmeso-DAP toL-lysine and is catalyzed by the enzyme
meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (LysA). This enzymatic
reaction is also common to all four DAP/lys anabolic variants
(Figure 1).
The various DAP/lys biosynthetic pathways are presumed
validated targets for the design of antibiotics and herbicides [8,9].
meso-DAP is one of the cross-linking amino acids in the cell wall of
Gram-positive bacteria andL-lysine plays the same role in Gram-
negative bacteria [10]. Compounds that inhibit enzymes involved
in the DAP/lys pathways are of interest since animals are unable
to carry out the synthesis of DAP/lysde novo. From a bacterial
point of view, inhibiting the pathway would eventually lead to
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20439
peptidoglycan lysis due to osmotic pressure followed by cell death
[8,11]. From a plant/photosynthetic cohort point of view, the
inhibition of the DAP/lys pathway would be detrimental to the
organism, since it would be unable to synthesizeL-lysine necessary
for protein synthesis. Therefore, enzymes affiliated with this
pathway are very attractive targets for antibacterial, herbicide and
algaecide development.
The structure of DapL from Arabidopsis thaliana was recently
reported [12,13]. DapL enzymes can be classified into two groups
based on sequence similarity: Type I enzymes originate from
plants and Chlamydia, while Type II enzymes, which share about
30% identity, are primarily found in some bacteria [3]. Based on
ligand bound structures, the binding modes for the substrates have
been detailed and such structural detail will be useful for inhibitor
design [13]. Indeed, inhibitors for the A. thaliana enzyme have
already been reported [14].
We are also interested in designing inhibitors of enzymes in the
L-lysine biosynthetic pathway [15,16,17,18] based primarily on our
knowledge of enzyme function and structure [19,20,21,22,23,24].
Here we identify and characterize the first Type I L,L-DAP
aminotransferase ortholog from an algae,Chalmydomonas reinhardtii,
annotated by the locus tag CHLREDRAFT_129557. We present
the crystal structure of the enzyme and show, for the first time, that
it is dimeric in solution using analytical ultracentrifugation. In
addition, we verify that DapL is essential in the photosynthetic
cohort Arabidopsis. The structural and kinetic properties of the
algal enzyme will be valuable information for the identification of
natural inhibitors or the design ofpseudo-substrate(s) to facilitate
algaecide development.
Results and Discussion
Identification of the DapL orthologous gene from
C. reinhardtii
In order to identify the DapL ortholog fromC. reinhardtii, the
genome of the alga was searched using the Arabidopsis protein

L, L-Diaminopimelate Aminotransferase from Algae

annotated by the locus At4g33680 as the query using the BLASTP
algorithm (http://www.chalmy.org/cgi-bin/webblast.pl). The se-
arch resulted in the identification of the an enzyme annotated as
an L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase by the locus tag
CHLREDRAFT_129557 (Cr-DapL) that was 65% identical to
the Arabidopsis enzyme.
The gene annotated by the locus tag CHLRE-
DRAFT_129557 encodesL,L-diaminopimelate
aminotransferase
To assess the function of CHLREDRAFT_129557, the full-
length cDNA was cloned and the enzyme was purified to
homogeneity using affinity chromatography (Figure 2). The o-
aminobenzaldehyde (OAB) assay was used to test whether Cr-
DapL had L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase activity and to
determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The results from
this analysis illustrate that, like the Arabidopsis enzyme, the algal
enzyme is specific for L,L-DAP. No enzymatic activity was
observed when various other amino donors that are structurally
similar to L,L-DAP, including the racemic isomer meso-DAP
(Table 1), were assayed. The same was true for the amino
acceptor. Using the same assay,Cr-DapL activity was only present
when 2-ketoglutarate was used as the amino acceptor. No activity
was observed when various 2-oxoacids were used in combination
with L,L-DAP (Table 1).
Kinetic properties of Cr-DapL
The pure recombinant enzyme was used to perform enzyme
assays to assess the kinetic properties using forward and reverse
quantitative assays. In the reverse assay,L,L-DAP serves as the
amino acceptor and 2-ketoglutarate serve as the amino acceptor.
In the anabolic direction of
L-lysine synthesis, glutamate serves as
the amino donor and THDPA serves as the amino acceptor. Using
these assays, the kinetic properties of the enzyme were tested at
varying concentrations of one substrate and at saturation levels of
other substrates (Supplementary Figure S1). The reciprocal plots
were linear and were consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
The V
max for the forward and reverse directions were calculated
along with the apparentKM for the various substrates. The enzyme
has a maximum velocity of approximately 11.6mmol min21 mg21
in the reverse direction and 0.68mmol min21 mg21 in the forward
direction (Table 2). The apparentKM for the four substrates were
0.3 mM forL,L-DAP, 2.2 mM for 2-ketoglutarate, 0.10 mM for
THDPA and 0.9 mM for glutamate.. The kinetic properties ofCr-
DapL are comparable to the Arabidopsis ortholog that was
previously characterized (Table 3).
Cr-DapL is able to functionally complement the E. coli
dapD/dapE (AOH1) mutant
The E. coli mutant AOH1 is suitable for a functional
complementation assay because it harbors loss-of-function muta-
tions indapD and dapE genes. For this strain, the cells lyse because
of osmotic stress, due to the lack ofmeso-DAP as a cross linking
amino acid in the cell wall. Thus, the strain is deemed auxotrophic
for DAP. The AOH1 strain was transformed with either an empty
plasmid or a plasmid expressing Cr-DapL. While the mutant is
able to grow only on media supplemented with DAP, only the
mutant strain expressing the algal enzyme is able to grow on DAP-
free media (Figure 3). The results from this assay indicate that the
enzyme is able convert THDPA toL,L-DAP directly bypassing the
DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic reactions present in theE. coli
pathway (Figure 1).
Structure of Cr-DapL
To determine the structural properties of the enzyme we
employed circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to gauge the
secondary structure, analytical ultracentrifugation to establish
the oligomeric state, and X-ray crystallography to define the
macromolecular structure of the enzyme.
CD analysis of Cr-DapL resulted in spectra (Figure 4, open
symbols) that displayed double minima at approximately 208 nm
and 222 nm, suggesting that the enzyme was folded. In order to
predict the secondary structure proportions, three algorithms were
used from the CDpro software package, CDSSTR, CONTIN and
SELCON3, against relevant protein databases. The best fit for the
Cr-DapL protein (Figure 4, solid line) resulted from using the
CONTIN algorithm against the SP43 database [25], which
predicted Cr-DapL to have predominantly a-helical secondary
structure (,50%), in combination with significant proportions of
b-strand (,15%), unordered structure (,20%), and turn (,15%),
under the buffer conditions used in this experiment (r.m.s.d.
= 0.18 M21 cm21).
To characterize the quaternary structure of Cr-DapL in
solution, sedimentation velocity studies were employed in the
analytical ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 9.2mM.
The data acquired forCr-DapL were fitted to a continuous size-
distribution model (Table 4) [26,27]. This yielded a modal
sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 5.41 S (r.m.s.d. = 0.005 and
Runs test-Z score = 3.1) (data not shown).
The continuous mass [ c(M)]-distribution indicates that the
recombinant Cr-DapL enzyme is dimeric in aqueous solution, with
an apparent molecular mass of 100.2 kDa (Figure 5). The [c(M)]-
distribution analysis also yielded an excellent fit, as indicated by
the random distribution of residuals (Figure 5) and statistical
parameters for the best-fit (r.m.s.d. = 0.005 and Runs test-Z
score = 3.0). The frictional ratio (f/f
0), which gives an indication of
average shape in solution, was 1.51, suggesting that the
hydrodynamic shape of Cr-DapL is asymmetric. These are the

first data demonstrating that the enzyme DapL is dimeric in
solution.
To examine the enzyme in atomic detail, we solved the crystal
structure ofCr-DapL to 1.55 A˚ resolution. The enzyme crystallized
in the space group P212121 and the structure was solved by
molecular replacement using theArabidopsis thaliana structure (Ar-
DapL, PDB id: 2Z20 [12]), with two monomers in the asymmetric
unit. The crystallization conditions and data collection details have
been previously published [28], but are briefly described in the
Materials and Methods section.
Consistent with our sedimentation velocity experiment, the two
monomers in the asymmetric unit interact closely to form a
dimeric species (Figure 6A) and are related by a non-crystallo-
graphic two-fold symmetry axis. The interface between the
monomers in the dimer buries ,21% of the surface accessible
area of each monomer and is composed primarily of hydrogen
bonds, but also includes four salt bridges between residues R314
and D170, and residues D311 and R39 of each monomer. An
overlay with the apo-Arabidopsis DapL dimer (PDB id: 3EI7 [13])
shows close agreement with an r.m.s.d. of 0.67 A˚ for 688a-carbon
atoms (Figure 6B).
A search for similar structural folds in the Protein Data Bank
using the DALI server [29] revealed that, apart from theAr-DapL,
aspartate aminotransferases were the most closely related in
structure to Cr-DapL. The most closely related structure was
aspartate aminotransferase from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PDB id:
1GDE) with a r.m.s.d. of 2.4 A˚ for 365 a-carbon atom pairs.
Another notable structure with significant similarity is M.
tuberculosis enzyme N-succinyl diaminopimelate aminotransferase
(PDB id. 2O0R [30], r.m.s.d. of 2.4 A˚ for 367 a-carbon atom
pairs), which, interestingly, is also involved in lysine biosynthesis
(dapE gene). N-succinyl diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapC,
Figure 1) mediates one of the three steps that bypassed by the
reaction catalyzed by DapL. A previous phylogenetic analysis
suggested that DapL was only distantly related to DapC enzymes,
and indeed they share,20% sequence identity [4]. The finding
that DapL and DapC show strong structural conservation may
suggest a closer evolutionary link than first thought.
Each monomer is ana/b protein in a V-shaped conformation
(Figure 6C) and is classified as a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-
dependent transferase-like fold by SCOP. The monomers are
largely a-helical in content, consistent with our CD data presented
above. The electron density for the N-terminal residues was very
poor and this likely contributes to the unordered structure (,20%)
predicted by the CD analysis. Given the high resolution, (1.55 A˚),
the electron density for the structure was clearly defined for most
of the structure (see Supplementary Figure S2). The final model
includes residues 33–439 in chain A and 26–438 in chain B. When
the two monomers in the asymmetric unit were superimposed
there was a very close agreement, with an r.m.s.d. of 0.15 A˚ for
339 a-carbon atoms. Based on the annotated domain structure of
the Arabidopsis DapL model [12], the overall fold of each
monomer ofCr-DapL consists of two domains, a large domain and
a small domain (Figure 6D). The large domain (L83–E352)
belongs to anab class, which folds into ana-b-a sandwich. The
small domain (N26–P82 plus N353–G438) also belongs to thea-
b
class of protein fold and forms ana-b complex. In addition, the
small domain also contains an ‘‘arm’’ region at the N-terminus.

L, L-Diaminopimelate Aminotransferase from Algae
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e20439
Arabidopsis structure bound to PLP (PDB id. 2Z20), the active site
sits in a crevice between the two lobes of the V-shaped monomer
and is lined with residues from both monomers in the dimer
(Figure 7A). This suggests a functional reason for the observed
dimeric structure. It has previously been noted that this is a
common quaternary structure for aminotransferases [12,31].
The geometry of the active site is quite different when compared
to apo-Ar-DapL, despite conservation of many of the residues
responsible for substrate and cofactor binding (Supplementary
Figure 3A and B). An overlay of the active site with that of the apo-
Ar-DapL structure (PDB id. 3EI7 [13]) shows key differences in the
orientation of loops A and B within the active site and a
displacement of a-helix 2 (Figure 7B), and is evident in the
structural alignment presented in Supplementary Figure S3B.
In theAr-DapL structure, loop A contains a shorta-helix, which
is involved in co-factor binding, including a key
L-lysine residue
(K270, Ar-DapL numbering) that covalently binds PLP to form the
reactive aldimine cofactor. In the Cr-DapL structure, this loop,
which comprises residues F280–G292 and includes the equivalent
key L-lysine residue (K282,Cr-DapL numbering), adopts a random
configuration (Figure 7B). We note, however, that our crystals
grew in the presence of LiSO 4 (200 mM) and the structure
contains a sulfate ion very close to where the phosphate of PLP
might sit in the active-site (Figure 7C). The sulfate makes direct
hydrogen bonds to the side-chain and main-chain atoms of
residues in loop A, as well as two water bridging interactions,
including K282. This perhaps explains the altered conformation of
the loop and, given the sulfate sits in nearly the identical place as
the phosphate of PLP, suggests the PLP binding conformation may
be different when compared toAr-DapL.
Loop B, which comprises residues A99–G114, also adopts a
different configuration to the equivalent loop inAr-DapL and this
may in part be responsible for the displacement ofa-helix 2. Loop
B, which sits at the top of the active-site of the opposing monomer,
is thought to act as a gate to the active-site for substrates [13]. The
high temperature factors (B-factors) for this loop (Supplementary
Figure S4C and D) suggest that it is flexible, presumably allowing
substrates access to the active-site even though it occludes the
entrance. Increased flexibility in this loop was also observed for the
apo-Ar-DapL structure [13]. In a series of ligand boundAr-DapL
models, Watanabeet al.have found that this loop becomes ordered

when substrates are bound, preventing access to the active site
[13]. In our Cr-DapL model, loop B, although flexible, also
interacts with the displaced a-helix 2 via a water-bridging
hydrogen bond between the main-chain atoms of Y107 and
A56, and a hydrogen bond between R59 and S105. In addition,
the N-terminal end of loop B binds to a second sulfate situated at
the entrance of the active-site in each monomer, with hydrogen
bonds to residues R101 and Y104. We also note that loop B is
considerably shorter in the four aspartate aminotransferases and
Mtb-succinylDAP aminotransferase most closely related to Cr-
DapL (,10 residues long compared to 15 residues inCr-DapL),
allowing unobstructed access to the active-site cleft (see Supple-
mentary Figure S5). In addition, thea-helix preceding loop B is
also longer by,1 full turn in the DapL enzymes compared to the
five closely related aspartate aminotransferases (Supplementary
Figure S5).
Another difference is that loop C, which comprises residues
T318–N325, is significantly disordered in the apo- Ar-DapL
structure, but well-ordered in our structure. This may again be
due to a hydrogen bond (2.9 A˚) between the side-chain of N321
within loop C with the ordered sulfate in the active-site (Figure 7C).
The altered loop structures in the Cr-DapL active-site,
compared to the apo-Ar-DapL model (Figure 7B), led to a number
of putative catalytic side-chains adopting alternate conformations
(Figure 8) and suggests that a major reorientation of the active site
is necessary upon cofactor and substrate binding. Figure 8 shows
the active site residues putatively responsible for substrate binding
and catalysis. The major differences surround the loop A, where
K282 is reoriented relative to the apo-Ar-DapL. In loop B, Y107 is
facing out of the active site compared to the equivalent residue in
apo-Ar-DapL, which points into the active active-site. K142, which
is thought to be necessary for substrate recognition, fills the space
that would be taken by the PLP cofactor. E110 from the other
monomer in the dimer and N321, which are both involved in
substrate recognition, are roughly in the same position.
To summarize our structural studies, we have shown by AUC
that Cr-DapL is a dimer in solution. The enzyme is also dimeric in
the crystalline form. Cr-DapL is an a/b protein with each
monomer of the dimer adopting a PLP-dependent transferase-like
fold in a V-shaped conformation. CD data is consistent with
proportions of secondary structure found in the crystal structure,
suggesting it is similarly folded in solution. The active site is
situated in a crevice between the two lobes of the V-shaped
monomer and comprises residues from both monomers in the
dimer. There is some rearrangement of the active site residues
when compared to the apo- Ar-DapL structure, although the
putative catalytic residues are conserved, suggesting that cofactor
and substrate binding requires reorientation of these residues.
The essentiality of DapL in Arabidopsis
Since it is difficult to show gene essentiality in the alga C.
reinhardtii, we chose to investigate whetherdapL was an essential
gene in the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Embryo
lethality screening can be used to assess the essentiality of a
particular gene and has identified genes that are essential in other
amino acid biosynthetic pathways, including histidine [32]. One of
the characteristics of this technique is that aborted seeds can be
observed in the fruit of mutant plants. DapL was previously
annotated as an aminotransferase-like enzyme designated Aber-
rant Growth and Death 2 protein and was shown to be essential
for plant developmentvia a T-DNA insertion mutant in the first
exon of the gene [33]. However, it is plausible that the phenotype
observed by Songet al.is a direct result of having multiple T-DNA
insertions, which occur at a significant rate in Arabidopsis [34].
Thus, we used embryo lethality screening to carefully test the
hypotheses that DapL was essential in Arabidopsis.
Analysis of a different T-DNA insertion in thedapL gene from
Arabidopsis (SAIL_208_H11) from our studies show for the first
time that dapL, which is now known to be involved in
L-lysine
biosynthesis, is an essential gene in plants and possibly in other
photosynthetic cohorts. This assay was carried out using a PCR
strategy to identify a heterozyogous plant along with a wild type
segregant from the mutant line (Figure 9A). The amplicon
corresponding to the T-DNA insertion site; the lower band in
lane 5 denoted as (B) was excised from the gel and subjected to
nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the
T-DNA is located in the promoter region of the gene, 300 base
pairs upstream of the initiation start codon (Figure 9B). The
heterozygous plant that was identified in the PCR analysis was
further grown to maturity and the siligues were observed for the
mutant phenotype. The black arrow shows the phenotype of a wild
type seed while the white arrows show the phenotypes of mutant
embryos (Figure 9C). Due to the essentiality of the gene,
homozygous plants were not observed using this strategy.

The phenotype analysis confirms thatdapL is an essential gene
in Arabidopsis by the observation of aborted embryos and
undeveloped embryos in the fruit of the plant (Figure 9C). Given
that the dapD, dapC and dapE genes are absent from the
Arabidopsis and algae genome, and that corn, tobacco,Chlamy-
domonas and soybean do not show DapC or DapE activity in lysates
[35], our results strongly suggest that the DapL pathway is the only
route to
L-lysine in these photosynthetic systems. Given that we
now have shown thatdapL is an essential gene in Arabidopsis, it is
plausible that this is a general feature in photosynthetic cohorts,
including algae. If this is the case, the identification and
characterization of the DapL ortholog from the algaeC. reinhardtii,
including our kinetic and structural studies, provides useful
information with respect to algaecide development.
From an evolutionary perspective, we think that the acyl and
Ddh pathways evolved to allow for faster growth rates. This
assertion is supported by the observation that organisms that use
the DapL pathway for DAP/lys synthesis are known to grow
significantly slower than organisms that contained either the acyl
pathways or a combination of the acyl and Ddh pathways.
Structural data supports the idea that the substrate for the DapL
enzyme is the acyclic keto form of THDPA, since the active site
does not easily fit the cyclic THDPA species [12,13]. For a
transamination reaction to be catalyzed by DapL, the system relies
on the spontaneous opening of THDPA that would expose the
keto group. We note that theequilibrium between the cyclic and
acyclic form of the species has not been elucidated [36]. The
function of DapD is to add an acyl protecting group to THDPA,
which results in the transition of THDPA from the cyclic form to
the acyclic form. This transition exposes the keto group for a
transamination reaction catalyzed by DapC. Since lysine and DAP
are components of cell wall, one would expect that DAP/lys
synthesis is coordinated to the growth of the organism.
In conclusion, anin vivoand in vitrocharacterization of the DapL
ortholog from the algaC. reinhardtii reveals that the enzyme could
functionally complement the E. coli dap auxotrophs and was

enzyme was able to inter-convert THDPA andL,L-DAP, showing
tight substrate specificity. The structure ofCr-DapL was solved in

comprises residues from both monomers in the dimer and show
some rearrangement when compared to the DapL structure from

dimeric at the concentrations tested. Since animals do not possess

Materials and Methods
C. reinhardtii growth conditions
C. reinhardtii strain CC-1690 was obtained fromChlamydomonas
Genetics Center (Duke University, Durham, NC) and was grown
in Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) medium. The strain was grown
in a growth chamber with a 16 hour light and 8 hour dark period
for 7 days. The temperature was 24uC during the light period and
20uC during the dark. The light intensity was approximately
120 mEM 22 sec21.
Functional complementation plasmid construct
The cloning of the full length dapL cDNA fromC. reinhardtiiwas
previously reported by us [28]. Briefly, the cDNA was cloned into
a pET30a vector to give the pET30a+Cr-DapL plasmid, which
gave a hexa-histidine and S-TAG epitope derived from pET30a

plasmid at the amino terminus. The plasmid used for functional
complementation of the E. coli dapD/E double mutant was
produced by sub-cloning the XbaI and HindIII fragment from
pET30a+Cr-DapL into pBAD33, to give pBAD33+Cr-DapL. The
fusion protein produced from the pBAD33 construct is identical to
the protein produced from the pET30a construct.
Functional complementation of dapD/dapE E. colimutant
The E. coli mutant AOH1 ( DdapD::Kan2,dapE6) [3] was
transformed with pBAD33 or pBAD33-Cr-DapL and grown on
LB agar medium supplemented with 50mgm L-1 DAP and 34mg
mL21 chloramphenicol and 50mgm L21 kanamycin . Individual
colonies were then replica plated onto LB medium plus 0.2% (w/v)
arabinose with or without 50mgm L21 DAP. The cultures were
grown at 30uC for 24 hours.
T-DNA mutant analysis
The Arabidopsis thalianaT-DNA mutant line SAIL_208_H11 was
obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center
(ABRC) (http://abrc.osu.edu/). For T-DNA insertion analysis,
the zygosity was assessed by PCR amplification using the RED
Extract-N-Amp
TM Plant PCR kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Sigma Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). A PCR strategy using
three primers was employed using the 12 picomoles of each
primer. The gene specific primers were 59-AAGAAAACAAAAC-
GACGCACC-39 and 5 9-TTGGATGAAGCAAAGTCTGT-
CAAC-39 and the T-DNA specific primer was 59-GCCTTTTCA-
GAAATGGATAAATAGCCTTGCTTCC-39. The following
PCR conditions was used in the PCR assay: 1 cycle at 94uC for
3minutes followed by 30 cycles at 94uC for 30 seconds, 60uC for
30 seconds, 72 uC for 2 minutes. The PCR amplicons were
resolved on 0.8% (
w/v) agarose gel.
Protein expression and purification
Full details for the expression and purification ofCr-DapL are
described elsewhere [28]. In summary, the plasmid pET30a+Cr-
DapL was transformed intoE. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIPL strain
and was grown in LB broth. Protein expression was induced with
IPTG for 4 hours at 25uC, followed by sonication in a solution of
50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. The
extract was incubated with Talon Metal Affinity Resin for 30
minutes at 4uC and extensively washed with sonication buffer
containing 10 mM imidazole pH 8.0, followed by elution with
sonication buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The pure protein
was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra 10 kDa Mw cutoff filter
unit, exchanging the buffer with 100 mM HEPES-KOH contain-
ing 1 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.6). To remove any
precipitated protein prior to crystallization, the purified protein
was passed through a S200 size exclusion column pre-equilibrated
with buffer (20 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA,
pH 7.8), followed by concentration with an Amicon Ultra
10 kDa Mw cutoff spin filter unit.
For expression ofCorynebacterium glutamicum meso-DAP dehydro-
genase (Ddh), E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring the plasmid
pET28+CgDdh was grown in LB broth containing 50
mgm L21
kanamycin at 37uCt oa nO D600 of 0.5. Ddh expression was
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 25uC. The cells were
lysed by sonication in 100 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6). The
protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 10 kDa Mw
cutoff device. The Ddh enzyme comprised approximately 90% of
the soluble fraction and was not further purified. For long-term
storage, the enzyme was stored in 50% glycerol.
Enzyme assays
Three different assays were used to measuredL,L-DAP amino-
transferase activity; two measured the synthesis of THDPA and
another measured the production ofL,L-DAP synthesis. The first
assay measured the formation of THDPA usingortho-aminobenzal-
dehyde, which forms dihydroquinazolium and absorbs light at
440 nm. A second assay usedmeso-DAP dehydrogenase coupled to
THDPA synthesis by measuring the oxidation of NADPH. A third
assay measured the physiologically significant forward reaction using
2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase coupled to 2-oxoglutarate synthesis
from THDPA by measuring the oxidation of thio-NAD+.
Measurement of L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase:
the 2-aminobenzaldehyde (OAB) assay. The 2-amino-
benzaldehyde (OAB) assay contained in 0.5 mL 100 mM HEPES-
KOH (pH 7.6), 0.5 mM amino donor, 2 mM 2-oxoglutarate, and
1.25 mM OAB and 10.0mg of pure recombinantCr-DapL protein.
Reactions were incubated at 30uC and the change in absorbance was
measured continuously at 440 nm with a DU 640 spectrophotometer
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).

in a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer at 20uC using a 1 mm path

length quartz curvette, 1 nm step size, 1 nm bandwidth, and 2 s
averaging time. Spectra ofCr-DapL in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM
KCl pH 8.0 were recorded at a protein concentration of 1mM.
CD spectra were analyzed by non-linear least-squares regression
using the CONTIN algorithm and various reference databases
available with the CDPro software package (available from http://
lamar.colostate.edu/,sreeram/CDPro/main.html) [37].
Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC)
AUC experiments were conducted in a Beckman model XL-I
instrument at 20 uC. The protein sample ( Cr-DapL, 0.45 mg
mL21, 9.2mM, monomeric mass = 48,830 kDa, v-bar = 0.721 mL
g21) was buffer exchanged with 50 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM DTT,
1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl pH 8.0) and loaded into double
sector quartz cells and mounted in a Beckman 4-hole An-60 Ti
rotor. Solvent density (1.00435 g ml21 at 20uC), viscosity (1.0341
cp) and an estimate of the partial specific volumes were computed
using the amino acid composition and the program SEDNTERP
[38].
For the sedimentation velocity experiments, 300ml of sample
and 320ml of reference solution were centrifuged at a rotor speed
of 45,000 rpm, and the data was collected at a single wavelength
(280 nm) in continuous mode, using a time interval of 0 s and a
step-size of 0.003 cm without averaging. The absorbance versus
radial position profiles were used in the nonlinear least squares
analysis. Initial scans were eliminated from the nonlinear
regression analyses due to temperature fluctuations at the
beginning of the experiment. Sedimentation velocity data at
multiple time points were fitted to a continuous sedimentation-
coefficient model using the program SEDFIT [26,27], available
from http://www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com).
Macromolecular crystallography
X-ray diffraction data from crystals ofCr-DapL were collected
on the MX2 beam-line at the Australian Synchrotron (Clayton,
Australia). Details for the protein crystallization and data
collection have been published elsewhere [28], but briefly, crystals
were obtained at 293 K by mixing 150 nL of protein solution
(8.6 mg mL21, in 20 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA,
pH 7.8) and 150 nL of reservoir solution (200 mM lithium sulfate,
25% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mM Bis-Tris propane,
pH 5.5, including 0.02%w/v sodium azide) using the sitting drop
method. Diffraction data sets were processed, scaled, and merged
using the package MOSFLM [39] and SCALA [40]. Molecular
replacement (PHASER [41]) was used to solve the initial phases
with the Arabidopsis DapL structure (PDB id 2Z20) as a search
model. Restrained refinement was performed using REFMAC5
[40] or PHENIX.REFINE [42]with iterative model building using
COOT [43]. A round of simulated annealing, using PHENIX.-
REFINE [42], was included early in the refinement scheme.
We chose to refine the final model anisotropically, even though
a resolution of 1.55 A˚ is in the grey zone for refining protein
structures in this way, given the low ratio of ‘‘observations’’ to
parameters that are refined [44]. We justify this strategy thus. 1)
The ratio of ‘‘observations’’ to refined parameters ( N/p) is
sufficient (N/p =,2.3 = (122,383 reflections+,27,290 restraints)
/ 65,070 parameters (see [45] and references therein)) and is
roughly comparable to the same structure refined isotropically at
2.19 A˚ resolution ( N/p =,2.5 = (43,942 reflections+,27,290
restraints) / 28,920 parameters). 2) We note that other structures
close to or at lower resolution have also been refined anisotrop-
ically (see Table 1 in [44]). 3) The restrained refinement,
employing the default restraints in REFMAC5.5_0.102, was
stable. 4) An analysis by the online Protein Anisotropic
Refinement Validation and Analysis Tool (PARVATI, [44])
showed a reasonable distribution in anisotropic protein atoms,
with a mean of 51 and as of 13 (Supplementary Figure S1A). 5)
There were no non-positive definite atomic displacement param-
eters in the model. And 6), there was a 2.1% drop in theRfree
statistic, from 19.1% to 17.1%, and a similar drop inRfact, from
15.7% to 14.2%, suggesting that expanding the model to include
anisotropy represents a better fit to the data.
The electron density for the N- and C-terminal residues was
very poor; thus, the final model includes residues 33–438 in chain
A and 26–438 in chain B. Residues 105–110 of both monomers,
which comprise loop B at the entrance of the active site of the
opposing monomer, were also poorly defined and therefore tight
NCS restraints for this region were included throughout the
refinement to stabilize the geometry of the loop. Side-chain atoms
without electron density to guide model building were deleted
from the final model. The model also included four sulfate ions,
two glycerol molecules, and three azide molecules. The structure
was validated using the MolProbity server (http://molprobity.
biochem.duke.edu/) [46]. The Ramachandran plots (Supplemen-
tary Figure S6) showed that 99.9% of the residues in the model
were in the most favoured or additionally allowed regions.
Refinement statistics are shown in Table 4. The final model has
been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB id 3QGU).
