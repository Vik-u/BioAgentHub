Understanding the response of microbial communities and their potential 
functions is essential for sustainability of agroecosystems under long-term 
continuous cropping. However, limited research has focused on investigating 
the interaction between soil physicochemical factors and microbial community 
dynamics in agroecosystems under long-term continuous cropping. This 
study probed into the physicochemical properties, metabolites, and microbial 
diversity of tobacco rhizosphere soils cropped continuously for 0, 5, and 
20  years. The relative abundance of bacterial genera associated with nutrient 
cycling (e.g., Sphingomonas) increased while potential plant pathogenic fungi 
and beneficial microorganisms showed synergistic increases with the duration 
of continuous cropping. Variations in soil pH, alkeline nitrogen (AN) content, and 
soil organic carbon (SOC) content drove the shifts in soil microbial composition. 
Metabolites such as palmitic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, stearic acid, and 
hippuric acid may play a key role in soil acidification. Those results enhance our 
ability to predict shifts in soil microbial community structure associated with 
anthropogenic continuous cropping, which can have long-term implications 
for crop production.

Introduction
Continuous cropping is a common farming practice in China 
(Zhang Y . Z. et al., 2022), involves growing the same crop on the same 
plot of land for extended periods with the aim of achieving high yields 
(Zhang S. et al., 2022). However, continuous cropping tobacco rather 
than reasonable crop rotation (tobacco-soybean-corn), often leads to 
severe continuous cropping obstacles, usually manifested as more 
frequent plant diseases epidemics and soil microbial community 
changes (Ma et al., 2022). Generally, continuous cropping accelerates 
soil acidification, thus promoting the outbreak of crop diseases (Li 
et al., 2017). The frequent occurrence of crop diseases reduces the 
quality of crops and even leads to crop failure in karst agroecosystems 
(Gao et al., 2019).
Tobacco has been extensively utilized as a model organism in 
numerous studies pertaining to plant biotechnology ( Sierro et al., 
2014). It is also an important crop widely planted in impoverished 
areas ( Chen F . et  al., 2018 ). Due to the limited arable land 
resources, tobacco is continuously grown on the same plots for 
over 20 years, leading to persistent challenges associated with 
continuous cropping and subsequent yield reductions ( Matheri 
et al., 2023 ). Several studies have demonstrated that after 7 years of 
continuous cropping, tobacco plants could sustain wilt disease 
caused by soil-borne fungi ( Niu et  al., 2017 ). In addition, the 
modification of resident soil microbial flora is related to changes 
in soil physicochemical properties and soil enzymatic activities 
(Chen S. et al., 2018 ). Soil microorganisms are effective biological 
indicators of soil fertility as they play a significant role in 
agricultural production ( Avidano et al., 2005 ; Chen W . et al., 2018; 
Y an et al., 2023). The diversity index of soil microbial community 
composition tends to decrease after long-term continuous 
cropping, reduce the number of beneficial microorganisms, and 
increase the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, thus reducing crop 
yields ( Xiong et al., 2015 ; Gao et al., 2019 ). The previous studies 
have indicated a significant decline in the abundance of beneficial 
microorganisms with prolonged tobacco cropping ( Maguire et al., 
2020). Cultivation has been found to alter microbial communities, 
leading to a notable increase in Fusarium abundance. Consequently, 
urgent measures are required to effectively manage this pathogen 
in arable farmlands. However, limited research has focused on 
assessing soil health under long-term continuous tobacco cropping 
(Xiong et al., 2015 ). Therefore, safeguarding the soil agricultural 
micro-ecosystem is imperative for promoting optimal crop growth.
Crops secrete allelopathic substances such as secondary 
metabolites, which affect the soil environment and cause continuous 
cropping obstacles ( Gerhards and Schappert, 2020 ). Soil 
microorganisms play a pivotal role in modulating the effects of these 
secondary metabolites, exerting both positive and negative influences 
on crop growth. Firstly, soil microorganisms decompose toxic 
compounds to reduce allelopathy (Jilani et al., 2008). Secondly, the 
breakdown of allelopathic residues by soil microorganisms can lead 
to the release of additional phytotoxins ( Cipollini et  al., 2012 ). 
Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the mechanisms underlying 
soil-borne diseases associated with continuous tobacco cropping.
By the time of writing, limited reports have elucidated the 
response of microbial communities to long-term continuous tobacco 
cropping. In this study, we  employed Illumina sequencing and 
metabolomics to investigate the changes in soil microbial communities 
and the types of allelopathic substances under continuous cropping. 
The objectives encompassed (i) exploring the diversity and 
composition responses of microorganisms to varying durations of 
continuous cropping; (ii) evaluating the specific microbial taxa 
associated with the development of obstacles posed by continuous 
cropping; and (iii) predicting the variation tendency of karst 
agroecosystems and their responses to prolonged periods of 
continuous cropping.
Materials and methods
Soil collection
The experimental site was located in Weining experimental 
station, at Bijie City, Guizhou province, China (27°05′N, 103°51′E). 
The region has a typical karst plateau landform and a humid 
subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 
18°C, an average sea level of 2,092 m, and annual precipitation of 
926 mm. The main soil type was calcareous soil developed from 
limestone. Farmlands under continuous tobacco cropping for 5 and 
20 years were selected for sampling as Y5 and Y20. Collected soil 
samples from cornfield adjacent to the sampling site Y5, where 
tobacco had never been planted, were used as the control (CK). Field 
management measures in CK were consistent with treatment groups 
to minimize any confusion caused by the effects of agricultural 
management practices on soil metabolites or microorganisms. The 
amount of fertilizer applied was 600 kg/ha of NPK compound fertilizer 
(N 15%, P2O5 15%, and K2O 20%). All fertilizers were used as base 
fertilizer and applied to the soil at one time. Topdressing was 
performed every 30 days for two times with N: 20 kg·ha, P2O5: 20 kg·ha, 
and K2O: 50 kg·ha.
Three types of soil samples were collected from the plow layers 
(5–20 cm deep) in April 2021, labeled, respectively. In order to ensure 
the consistency of sampling time, samples were collected from three 
fields at the same day. Soil samples were collected from the surface of 
tobacco roots in plow layers (5–20 cm). Soil closely attached to the 
roots was washed using sterile water and pooled in a 50-mL Falcon 
tube as rhizosphere soil (Kui et al., 2021). In each field, samples were 
collected via a five-point sampling method to obtain representative 
samples. For each group, five soil samples were collected and 
combined to form a single sample, which was repeated three times. 
The above samples were divided into two parts. One was air-dried for 
physicochemical property analysis, and the other was stored at −80°C 
for DNA extraction.
Analysis of soil basic properties
Soil pH levels were determined in suspensions with a soil-water 
(w/w) ratio of 1:2.5 ( Ali et  al., 2021 ). Soil organic carbon (SOC) 
contents were measured using the colorimetric method (Looft et al., 
2012). Available phosphorus (AP) was extracted with sodium 
bicarbonate and analyzed using the molybdenum blue method (Pu 
et al., 2014). Available potassium (AK) contents were measured with 
ammonium acetate and assessed using flame photometry (Watanab e 
and Olsen, 1965). Available nitrogen (AN) was extracted using the 
alkaline hydrolysis diffusion method (Li et al., 2019).

Analysis of soil microbial communities
Total DNA was extracted from soil samples (0.5 g each) using the 
TGuide Soil DNA Kit (Tiangen DP812, Beijing, China). The V3-V4 
regions of the16S rRNA genes were amplified by the bacterial 
primers 338F (5 ′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R 
(5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Universal primers ITS1F 
(5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′) and ITS2R (5 ′-GCTG 
CGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′) were used to amplify fungal ITS1 
region (Ward et  al., 2017; Gu et  al., 2022 ). We  purified the PCR 
products using the Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (T1020L, MA, 
United States). Then, the purified amplicons were employed for library 
construction using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina, 
CA, United  States) at Biomarker Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, 
China). The raw FASTQ files of the fungal and bacterial reads resulting 
from Illumina sequencing were filtered by Trimmomatic (version 
v0.33) and merged by Usearch (version v10) ( Edgar, 2013; Bolger 
et  al., 2014 ). These high-quality sequences were clustered into 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 97% similarity 
threshold using UPARSE (Edgar et al., 2011). An averaged OTU table 
was generated by resampled OTU subsets under 90% of the minimum 
sequencing depth for further analysis to reduce the effects of different 
sequencing depths on the analyses (Liu S. et al., 2021). Bacterial and 
Fungal taxonomies were assessed against the 16S rRNA database 
(Silva v128) and the UNITE fungal ITS database (UNITE v8.0), 
respectively (Jiao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022). The alpha diversity 
metrics, beta diversity metrics, and other analyses were calculated 
using QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2011) and R packages (version 3.1.1) 
(R Core Team, 2019 ). All sequence data were deposited in NCBI 
Sequence Read Archive database under accession 
number PRJNA874867.
Metabolite profiling
Each soil sample was frozen-crushed using a steel ball at 30 Hz for 
1.5 min. Each sample (1,000 mg) was extracted using 1.0 mL of 70% 
aqueous methanol (AM) and 1 mL of ethyl acetate (EA) with 5 μL 
internal standard at 4°C. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 
15 min, the supernatant was transferred into a 5-mL EP tube. After 
evaporation in a vacuum concentrator, 30 μL of ethoxyamination 
hydrochloride was added to the obtained product, and the mixture 
was then incubated at 80°C for 30 min and derivatized by 40 μL of 
BSTFA regent (1% TMCS, v/v) at 70°C for 1.5 h. All samples were 
adsorbed and filtrated before being subjected to analysis with a gas 
chromatograph (Agilent 7890, 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm, J&W 
Scientific, Folsom, CA, United States) coupled with a time-of-flight 
mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) (Kind et al., 2009).
Statistical analysis
Based on the results of species annotations of all samples, the 
top 10 phyla and the top 35 genera were analyzed (relative abundance 
above 1%). Chao 1, Shannon, Simpson, and ACE indices were used to 
estimate the diversity of the microbial communities. Non-metric 
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was performed to 
investigate the structural variation of microbial communities across 
samples using Weighted uniFrac distance metrics (Looft et al., 2012). 
Principal component analysis (PCA) was also conducted based on 
OTU level compositional profiles ( Ramette, 2007). The taxonomy 
compositions and abundances were visualized using MEGAN (Liu 
J. L. et al., 2021). Redundancy analyses (RDA) were used to investigate 
the relationships between samples and environmental variables (R: 
vegan package) ( Oksanen et  al., 2020 ). The heatmaps and Venn 
diagrams were generated using custom R scripts (Clauset et al., 2004). 
Bacterial functional potential was investigated with FAPROTAX 
database (Louca et  al., 2016 ). Functional prediction analysis was 
carried out using FUNGuild database ( Nilsson et  al., 2019 ). All 
analyses were conducted on the BMK Cloud platform (Biomarker 
Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China; https://international.biocloud.
net/zh/software/agriculture/) based on various R packages and 
workflow frameworks. A one-way ANOV A was performed to 
determine the significance of the differences of soil properties and 
microbial community structures between three treatments by SPSS. A 
p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Soil samples physicochemical properties
The physicochemical properties of soil samples after different 
continuous tobacco cropping durations are listed in Table  1. All 
samples were showed weak acidity. In addition, the soil pH level of 
Y20 decreased significantly. The SOC and AK contents in Y5 and Y20 
were significantly lower than those of CK. However, the AP and AN 
content of Y20 were highest, reaching 33.75 and 162.32 mg kg−1, 
respectively.
Overall microbial community diversity
The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced to analyze the soil microbial 
community diversity under long-term continuous tobacco cropping. 
A total of 659,973 raw reads and 636,731 clean reads of bacteria were 
obtained, with an average length of 418 bp. As a result of chimeral 
filtration and QC, a total of 718,690 raw reads and 715,307 clean reads 
of fungi were obtained, with an average length of 237 bp. Through the 
analyses of alpha diversity, we  found that the levels of bacterial 
richness tended to increase with the duration of continuous cropping. 
The richness of fungi reached the highest level after continuous 
cropping for 5 years, and then decreased gradually as the duration of 
continuous cropping increased further. Nevertheless, levels of soil 
fungal diversity tended to increased and then decreased, although no 
significant difference was found.
Soil microbial community composition
The tobacco rhizosphere soils were home to 29 bacterial phyla, 81 
classes, 183 orders, 303 families, and 565 genera. The dominant 
bacterial phyla in all samples included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes, accounting for 77.44–9.74% 
of all sequences ( Figure  1A ). Proteobacteria dominated the 
rhizosphere soil, occupying 38.03–44.35% of all sequences, and their

Frontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org
relative abundances in Y5 and Y20 were significantly higher than 
those in CK. The relative abundances of Acidobacteria, 
Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia 
were higher in Y20 than in Y5. The relative abundances of dominant 
genera varied in the soil samples with different continuous cropping 
durations. The relative abundances of Gemmatimonas, 
Gemmatimonadaceae, and Ramlibacter in Y5 were significantly higher 
than that in CK and Y20. The relative abundances of Sphingomonas, 
Massilia, Acidobacteriales, Burkholderiaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, and 
Gaiellales in Y20 were significantly higher than in CK. Whereas the 
relative abundances of Gemmatimonas, Micrococcaceae, and 
Micromonosporaceae showed the opposite trend.
The tobacco rhizosphere soils were inhabited by seven fungal 
phyla, 22 classes, 57 orders, 118 families, and 202 genera. 
Ascomycota was the most abundant among with a relative 
abundance of 62.06–80.81%, followed by Basidiomycota (10.63 to 
20.77%), Mortierellomycota (2.56 to 17.71%), and Chytridiomycota 
(0.74–9.56%) ( Figure 1B ). The relative abundance of Ascomycota 
in Y20 was significantly higher than that in Y5. However, the 
relative abundance of Mortierellomycota increased with the length 
of continuous cropping, with that in Y20 15.51% higher than that 
in CK. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Mortierella, 
Byssochlamys, and Pseudopyrenochaeta  decreased and then 
increased with the duration of continuous cropping; in contrast, 
that of Penicillium, Plectosphaerella , Aspergillus , Sebacina, 
Botryotinia, and Inocybe increased first and then decreased. Among 
the top  15 genera, the relative abundances of Cladosporium 
(11.55%), Epicoccum (16.09%), Vishniacozyma (6.95%), and 
Alternaria (7.80%) in CK were higher than that in Y5 and Y20. 
Additionally, the relative abundances of Mortierella (17.70%), 
Fusarium (10.30%), Chaetomium (8.69%), and Byssochlamys 
(10.23%) in Y20 were higher than that in other samples.
Differences in microbial communities
The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the 
community structure differences between groups 
(Supplementary Figure S1 A). For bacteria, the first principle 
component (PC1) and the second principle component (PC2) 
contributed 37.63 and 23.04%, respectively. The Y20 samples were 
distinctive from the CK and Y5 samples. Y20 had the highest PC1 
value, while Y5 had the highest PC2 value. CK had the lowest PC1 and 
PC2 values. For fungi, PC1 contributed 32.58%, and PC2 contributed 
21.59% (Supplementary Figure S1B). Y20 had the highest PC1 value, 
and CK had the highest PC2 value. The Y5 and Y20 samples were 
highly similar and distinctive from the CK samples.
Similarly, with the process of time, the community structure of 
bacteria and fungi changed significantly (R2 = 0.43, p < 0.01; R2 = 0.35, 
p < 0.01) (Figure 2). Weighted UniFrac nonmetric multidimensional 
scaling (NMDS) analysis (stress = 0.001) showed that the bacterial 
community structure was significantly different between three groups.

The phylogenetic structures of soil fungal communities varied after 
different continuous cropping durations, where the three groups were 
significantly distinctive from other groups.
Environmental factors correlated to 
microbial communities
Based on OTU reads and environmental factors, the 
representational difference analysis (RDA) was performed on the 
different continuous tobacco cropping. The relationships between 
bacterial communities and soil properties are shown in Figure 3A 
(axis 1 = 20.33%, axis 2 = 16.5%). The results indicated that the pH 
level (R2 = 0.8590, p = 0.008), SOC content ( R2 = 0.7509, p = 0.013), 
and AK content ( R2 = 0.9267, p = 0.003) were significantly 
correlated with bacterial communities. The correlation heatmap 
showed that at the phylum level, the abundance of Actinobacteria 
was significantly positively correlated with the SOC content 
(p < 0.05), and the abundance of Chloroflexi was significantly 
positively correlated with the AK content. In addition, the 
abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly negatively correlated 
with the pH level and the AK content. At the genus level, the 
abundance of Micromonosporaceae was positively correlated with 
the pH level and the AK content, and the abundance of 
Acidobacteriales  was positively correlated with the AN content 
(p < 0.05) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, the abundance of Massilia was 
negatively correlated with the pH and AK content.
Figure  3B  (axis 1 = 19.77%, axis 2 = 14.03%) showed the 
relationships between fungal communities and soil properties. The pH 
level (R2 = 0.957, p = 0.001), SOC content (R2 = 0.842, p = 0.004), AP 
content (R2 = 0.6582, p = 0.041), and AK content (R2 = 0.671, p = 0.037) 
were the main factors affecting the changes in fungal phylogenetic 
structure ( Figure  3B). The abundance of Chytridiomycota was 
significantly positively correlated with the pH level and the AK 
content (p < 0.01), the abundance of Ascomycota was significantly 
positively correlated with the SOC content ( p < 0.001), and the 
abundance of Mortierellmycota was significantly positively correlated 
with the AP content ( p < 0.05). In addition, the abundance of 
Glomeromycota was significantly negatively correlated with the AP 
content, and the abundance of Olpidiomycota was significantly 
negatively correlated with the AN content. At the genus level, the 
abundance of Alternaria was positively correlated with the pH level 
and the AK content, and the abundance of Cladosporium was 
positively correlated with the SOC content ( p < 0.01) (Figure  3D). 
Moreover, the abundance of Mortierella was positively correlated with 
the AP content (p < 0.05).
Soil microbial function prediction
Based on the FAPROTAX database, we predicted the bacterial 
functions and obtained the top  15 functional groups. The results 
showed significantly enhanced ureolysis and manganese oxidation, 
while nitrate reduction, predatory or ectoparasitic, and chitinolysis 
were significantly weakened (Figure 4A). Other functional groups 
showed no significant changes, such as chemoheterotrophy, aerobic 
chemoheterotrophy, aerobic ammonia oxidation, fermentation, 
nitrogen fixation, and nitrification.
To study the functional difference of fungal communities in 
samples, FUNGuild database was used to perform a functional 
prediction (Figure 4B). The fungal community trophic types included 
pathotrophs, saprotrophs, and symbiotrophs. Saprotrophs was 
dominated in CK accounting for 36% with plant pathogen accounting 
for 26% of the total community. Plant-pathogens were increased and 
then decreased with the duration of continuous cropping. 
Ectomycorrhizal were significantly increased in Y5 accounting for 
13% compared to all the other treatment groups.
Analysis of metabolites in soil
A total of 823 metabolites were detected through GC–MS, and 99 
were identified. The total ion mass spectra of soil in CK, Y5, and Y20 
were basically similar in profile and in peak time. The results indicated 
that the types of metabolites were similar in different continuous 
cropping duration. Among the top  30 compounds in relative 
abundance of metabolites, 14 acids, five alcohols, three sugars, two 
esters, two phenols, and six other complex compounds were detected 
FIGURE 2

(Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, we observed that the samples 
contained acidic component as palmitic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid, stearic acid, hippuric acid, 2-ketobutyric acid, lactic acid, 
4-acetylbutyric acid, glycine, 3-aminoisobutyric acid, citrulline, 
sulfuric acid, citraconic acid, valine, and cycloleucine. With the 
lengthening of continuous cropping, the content of 
3-hydroxypropionic acid increased significantly, and that of palmitic 
acid and stearic acid decreased rapidly and then increased significantly. 
The other compounds showed no significant change in CK, Y5, 
and Y20.
One trait influencing rhizosphere microbial changed could 
be  soil micro-environment. To address this hypothesis, a 
correlation analysis between the rhizosphere microorganisms 
whose abundance markedly changed at the genus level and 
metabolites in soil was performed. The results of the correlation 
analysis were shown in Figure 6 . The results revealed that pH and 
AN significantly correlated with bacteria. Meanwhile, 
1-Monopalmitin significantly correlated with fungi.
Discussion
Soil microbial communities are essential for plant nutrition and 
soil health (Fitzpatrick et al., 2018). However, long-term continuous 
cropping system breaks the balance of soil microbial community 
structure. Few scholars have evaluated the effects of long-term 
continuous cropping in karst agroecosystems of Guizhou province, 
China. Continuous cropping mode may decrease the nutrient ratio of 
soil and increase the incidence of pests, leading to poor crop growth 
and decreased yield and quality (An et al., 2022). The extensive use of 
pesticides brings safety issues and soil environmental pollution during 
agricultural production and seriously harms the health of soil 
ecosystems (Jiang et al., 2022). However, information on the ecological 
interactions between soil microbiomes and the establishment of 
disease-suppressive systems is still scarce. Therefore, clarifying the 
impact of long-term continuous cropping on karst agroecosystems 
may provide new avenues for managing microbiome-driven soil 
self-recovery.

Soil microbial community changes
High-throughput sequencing revealed that bacterial community 
increased with the increase in continuous cultivation years, consistent 
with the findings of some studies on other crop species (Zhang et al., 
2017; Fei et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021; Y ao et al., 2023). Specifically, the 
bacterial community composition was dominated by Proteobacteria, 
Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes at the 
bacterial phylum level. The abundance of Proteobacteria was 
increased, which may change the ecological function of soil. 
Proteobacteria are a broad phylum and can grow fast in soils with 
unstable substrate conditions (Zeng et al., 2017). The increase in easily 
decomposable nutrients can stimulate the increase in the abundance 
of Proteobacteria. Acidobacteria have a wide range of metabolic and 
genetic functions and exhibit a robust inverse response to soil pH 
(Wang et al., 2016). Interestingly, the abundance of Acidobacteria 
increased and then decreased as soil pH decreased in our study. 
Copiotrophic microbes are regarded to be related to R-strategy (Fierer 
et al., 2007). The theory of microbial nutrition strategies assists in 
comprehending our results. In our study, the relative abundances of 
Sphingomonas and Massilia were significantly higher in Y20 than in 
other groups, whereas those of Gemmatimonas, Micrococcaceae, and 
Micromonosporaceae showed the opposite trends. Sphingomonas can 
survive under nutrient conditions and is essential in decomposing 
recalcitrant organic matters. It has exploitable potential in ecological 
environment restoration and will be  a hot spot in the microbial

restoration of the environment in the future. Massilia presents in 
rhizosphere soil as symbiotic bacterium (Cardinale et al., 2019). In this 
study, the RDA results indicated that the AP content was positively 
correlated with the relative abundances of Sphingonas and Massilia 
(Figure 3), and the changes in AN content could indirectly affect their 
relative abundances. Previous reports have shown that Sphingomonas 
and Massilia can dissolve phosphorus, and their relative abundances 
are positively correlated with the activity of phosphatase (Cardinale 
et al., 2019; Son et al., 2021). We speculate that the increases in the 
relative abundances of Sphingomonas and Massilia provide more AP 
for plants and fungi in continuous cropping soil. Gemmatimonas, 
Micrococcaceae, and Micromonosporaceae are beneficial bacteria that 
widely exist in soil and play a very important role in the stability of soil 
ecosystems. In this study, the abundances of Gemmatimonas, 
Micrococcaceae, and Micromonosporaceae decreased significantly with 
continuous cropping. We speculated that tobacco roots continuously 
secreted secondary metabolites, contributing to the colonization of 
certain microbial species whereas inhibiting that of certain beneficial 
microbial species in continuous cropping systems (Y ou et al., 2015; 
Zhang et al., 2020).
We observed that different shifts in soil fungal compositions across 
different durations of continuous cropping. The abundance and diversity 
of fungal communities increased with the lengthening of continuous 
cropping in alpha diversity. The dominant genera in all groups were 
Mortierella, Fusarium, Byssochlamys, Chaetomium, Penicillium, and 
Cladosporium. Among them, Mortierella is a beneficial fungus with 
contributions to soil nutrient transformation and availability (Ning et al., 
2020). Adding Mortierella to soil can significantly increase the contents of 
AP , potassium, AK, magnesium, and boron (Francioli et  al., 2016). 
Chaetomium is an important fungus with a biocontrol effect, contributing 
to the decomposition of cellulose and residing within various plant 
residues and soils (Hubbard et al., 2011). Byssochlamys, Fusarium, and 
Cladosporium are plant pathogens. Fusarium is a widely reported 
pathogenic fungus; plants infected with it can wilt, which will 
be exacerbated by continuous cropping (Sant'Ana et al., 2009; Wang et al., 
2015). Mildly acidic conditions are suitable for the growth of Byssochlamys, 
which has a broad host spectrum and is pathogenic to many plants 
(Sant'Ana et  al., 2009). The relative abundance of Fusarium tends to 
decrease and increase subsequently with the lengthening of continuous 
strawberry cropping (Huang et  al., 2018). In this study, the relative 
abundances of potential phytopathogens (Byssochlamys and Fusarium) 
decreased and then increased with the duration of continuous cropping. 
Continuous soybean cropping increases the relative abundance of 
beneficial fungi, such as Mortierella sp., to inhibit plant pathogens (Liu 
et al., 2020). In this study, the relative abundance of the pathogenic fungus 
Mortierella was increased with the duration of continuous cropping. 
We speculated that tobacco root exudates recruited beneficial fungi to 
compete with pathogenic microbiomes under long-term continuous 
cropping. Overall, potential plant pathogenic fungi and beneficial 
microorganisms showed synergistic increases under long-term 
continuous cropping.
Soil microbial community response to 
environmental drivers
Previous studies have shown that long-term continuous cropping 
leads to the deterioration of soil chemical properties and decreased 
plant yields (Liu Q. et al., 2021). Continuous cropping obstacles may 
be  associated with changes in soil pH and nitrogen content. The 
FIGURE 6

Frontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org
decreased pH level reduces the availability of soil nutrients and 
interferes with nutrient absorption, impeding normal crop 
development (Huang et al., 2018). Continuous cropping obstacles may 
be attributable to the decreased soil pH (Zhang et al., 2015). This study 
demonstrated that the soil pH level was negatively associated with the 
AN content, which agrees well with a previous study (Zhang and Lin, 
2009). The contents of AP and AN after continuous soybean cropping 
for 13 years were significantly higher than those after 3 or 5 years. Soil 
nutrients exhibited no decrease after long-term continuous cropping, 
indicating that the lack of plant nutrients may not directly cause plant 
diseases (Mbanyele et al., 2022).
Furthermore, soil microbial communities were affected by 
environmental factors, including soil pH levels and the contents of AN 
and AP . The RDA and correlation heatmap were used to analyze the 
relationships between soil microbial composition and environmental 
factors ( Figure  3 ). Previous studies have demonstrated that 
environmental factors have different effects on bacterial and fungal 
communities (Dong et al., 2017). This study found that the effects of 
environmental factors on bacterial diversity were more dramatic than 
fungal diversity. Among the bacteria, the abundance of 
Micromonosporaceae was positively correlated with the pH level and 
AK content, that of Acidobacteriales was positively correlated with the 
AN content, and that of Massilia was negatively correlated with the pH 
and AK content. Among the fungi, the abundance of Alternaria was 
positively correlated with the pH and AK content, that of Cladosporium 
was positively correlated with the SOC content, and that of Mortierella 
was positively correlated with the AP content. In summary, the pH 
level and AK content had the greatest influence on the soil microbial 
community structure, while the AP content significantly influenced 
the formation of the fungal community structure.
Soil microbial function predictions
Different microbial functional communities were formed at different 
successional stages (Liu S. et  al., 2021). The abundances of different 
bacterial metabolic pathways were predicated using the FAPROTAX 
database. We observed significant increases in ureolysis and manganese 
oxidation and significant decreases in nitrate reduction, predatory or 
ectoparasitic, and chitinolysis with the duration of continuous cropping. 
According to the nutrient competition hypothesis, the growth and 
reproduction of mycorrhizal fungi and free microorganisms need 
nutrients (Orwin et  al., 2011). Previous studies have reported that 
ectomycorrhizal and plant pathogens can secrete enzymes to degrade 
organic matter, which inhibits the nitrogen restriction of free 
microorganisms, thus inhibiting organic matter decomposition 
(Cederlund et al., 2014; Averill, 2016). We found that the abundances of 
plant-pathogens and ectomycorrhiza increased and then decreased, 
which may be caused by the interactions of ectomycorrhizal and plant 
pathogens with free microorganisms. Finally, we concluded that fungal 
changes might alter the soil nutrient cycles in karst ecosystems under 
long-term continuous cropping.
Analysis of metabolites in soil
The deterioration of soil chemical properties was considered to 
be  associated with long-term continuous cropping crops 
(Xie et al., 2017 ). It was reported that crop released a great variety 
of secondary metabolites into the soil environment through root 
exudation or residue decomposition ( Liu et  al., 2018 ). The 
allelochemicals have been proposed that can improve the activities 
of soil-borne pathogens, which are released by the crops 
(Bonanomi et  al., 2016 ). In our finding, the soil pH decreased 
significantly with the duration of continuous cropping increased, 
which is consistent with previous studies ( Chen et al., 2022 ). The 
accumulation of acids might cause soil acidification ( Agegnehu 
et al., 2016 ). There had differences in metabolites in soil among 
different periods of continuous cropping in this finding. The 
content of palmitic acid and stearic acid increased initially and 
then decreased as the cropping continued. The palmitic acid 
influenced plant growth and metabolism, which have found in high 
levels in many plant root exudates and residues ( Ma et al., 2021 ; 
Xin et al., 2022 ). Previous studies have proved that palmitic acid 
and stearic acid can significantly inhibit the germination of seeds 
and the growth of seedlings ( Xiang et al., 2022 ). In the process of 
penetration and colonization, fungi can secret an array of 
extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, which can degrade cell walls of 
roots, secreting substantial quantities of organic acids ( Gu et al., 
2022). In this study, we used GC-TOF-MS to analyze secondary 
metabolites in soil and found many organic acids and their 
derivatives. Whether those metabolites are root exudates or 
secreted by microorganisms remains to be  further verified. In 
addition, our work has some limitations, and additional studies are 
needed to investigate the dynamic changes in soil metabolites and 
their relations with soil microorganisms. These finding could 
be used to reveal the mechanism of soil sickness associated with 
long-term continuous cropping crops.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that continuous cropping system 
exerted a significant impact on the microbial community structure, 
exhibiting discernible disparities between long-term and short-term 
continuous cropping farmland. Furthermore, the soil pH level as well 
as AN content and SOC content were key environmental factors 
contributing to microbial community structural and functional 
changes. Long-term continuous cropping fostered synergistic 
increments in potential plant pathogenic fungi and beneficial 
microorganisms. However, further research is warranted to investigate 
whether and how pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms interact 
with plant secondary metabolites requires.
