Introduction: Inﬂammation is a common unifying factor in experimental models of
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. Recent evidence suggests that
housing temperature-driven alterations in hepatic inﬂammation correlate with
exacerbated hepatic steatosis, development of hepaticﬁbrosis, and hepatocellular
damage in a model of high fat diet-driven NAFLD. However, the congruency of these
ﬁndings across other, frequently employed, experimental mouse models of NAFLD
has not been studied.
Methods: Here, we examine the impact of housing temperature on steatosis,
hepatocellular damage, hepatic in ﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis in NASH diet,
methionine and choline deﬁcient diet, and western diet + carbon tetrachloride
experimental models of NAFLD in C57BL/6 mice.
Results: We show that differences relevant to NAFLD pathology uncovered by
thermoneutral housing include: (i) augmented NASH diet-driven hepatic immune
cell accrual, exacerbated serum alanine transaminase levels and increased liver
tissue damage as determined by NAFLD activity score; (ii) augmented methionine
choline deﬁcient diet-driven hepatic immune cell accrual and increased liver tissue
damage as indicated by ampliﬁed hepatocellular ballooning, lobular inﬂammation,
ﬁbrosis and overall NAFLD activity score; and (iii) dampened western diet + carbon
tetrachloride driven hepatic immune cell accrual and serum alanine
aminotransferase levels but similar NAFLD activity score.
Discussion: Collectively, ourﬁndings demonstrate that thermoneutral housing has
broad but divergent effects on hepatic immune cell in ﬂammation and
hepatocellular damage across existing experimental NAFLD models in mice.
These insights may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interrogations
focused on immune cell function in shaping NAFLD progression.

Introduction
The unabated obesity pandemic (~1.5 billion people obese
globally) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the
prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD,
which affects approximately 25-30% of obese individuals, is
considered the most common chronic liver disease and a leading
cause for needing liver transplantation (1, 2). NAFLD encompasses a
broad spectrum of liver conditions ranging from steatosis to non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis, which eventually can
progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1, 3). To study the
broad aspects of NAFLD progression the ﬁeld has traditionally
employed a variety of experimental animal models. Notably, in
mouse models of NAFLD, the strengths of each model are focused
on select key parameters represented in human disease (e.g., steatosis,
steatohepatitis, hepatocyte ba llooning, Mallory-Denk bodies
and ﬁbrosis).
Prominent mouse models of NAFLD involve various dietary
challenges including high fat diet (HFD), methionine choline
deﬁcient (MCD) diet, and chemical perturbations in combination
with western diet (WD) (e.g., Carbon tetrachloride [CCl
4] + WD diet)
(3– 6). HFD feeding drives robust obesity and hepatic recruitment of
Kupffer cells and neutrophils, and only causes mild inﬂammation and
minimal ﬁbrosis (the latter only evident after prolonged HFD feeding)
(7, 8). Conversely, MCD diet consistently induces robust hepatic
immune cell recruitment, liver damage, and development of hepatic
ﬁbrosis, without the induction of obesity ( 9– 11). Chemical
perturbations, including high-dose CCl 4,p r o m o t eh e p a t i c
inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis with induction of hepatocellular necrosis
that is not consistent with human liver disease pathogenesis (9). As
such, CCl4 is used at lower doses and in combination with WD
feeding to recapitulate histopathological manifestations of human
NAFLD more accurately. However, unlike in human disease, this
model is associated with weight loss (5). Nevertheless, despite being
traditionally employed in studying NAFLD pathogenesis, the above
discussed models only partly recapitulate clinical human disease
progression. Notably, these shortcomings may limit the discovery of
key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying liver disease
pathogenesis. Given that in ﬂammation represents a unifying
component of NAFLD progression (11– 14) across the models used,
further improvement of existing experimental models to enable
discovery of mechanisms that shape in ﬂammatory responses in
NAFLD may represent the critical locus of the effect for translation
of key discoveries to clinical relevance.
Ambient housing temperature regulates inﬂammatory responses
to internal and external stimuli (15, 16). Common animal facilities
house mice in thermo- stress (Ts) (20-23 ˚C) conditions. Such
conditions however are associated with the activation of cold stress
responses in mice, augmented production of stress hormone (e.g.,
corticosterone and catecholamine) which drives a multitude of
physiological and metabolic changes ( 17, 18). Importantly, Ts
housing suppresses immune respons es including altered cellular
energy availability, cytokine production, and lymphocyte egress
from lymph nodes ( 15, 19– 21). Conversely, thermoneutral (Tn)
housing (29-34 ˚C), a temperature where mice do not need to
expend excess energy to maintain core body temperature, reverses
the suppression of immune responsiveness observed at Ts housing
conditions (1, 3, 16, 22). In the context of NAFLD, Tn housing
coupled with HFD feeding accelerates and exacerbates disease
progression and pathogenesis. Speci ﬁcally, Tn housing in
combination with HFD feeding e nhances hepatic steatosis and
inﬂammation, and hepatocellular damage in wild type C57BL/6
male mice and hepaticﬁbrosis in AKR mice (3). Further, wild type
C57BL/6 female mice, which are generally resistant to HFD-induced
obesity when housed at Ts conditions, developed robust obesity and
NAFLD when housed at Tn conditions (3). Thus, the ability of Tn
housing to reverse paradigms seen at Ts conditions by restricting
immune suppression and promoting obesity in female mice warrants
the examination of the impact of Tn housing on hepatic
inﬂammation, steatosis, liver damage and development of hepatic
ﬁbrosis across multiple, traditionally used, experimental models of
NAFLD in mice.
Here, we show that Tn housing shapes hepatic inﬂammation across
multiple, traditionally used, experimental mouse models of NAFLD. In
a model utilizing NASH diet, Tn housing augments obesity, serum
ALT, hepatic immune cell accrual, expression of immune cell recruiting
chemokines which correlates with increased lobular in
ﬂammation and
liver disease as determined by NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). Similarly,
in the MCD diet driven NAFLD model, Tn housing promotes
increased hepatic expression of immune cell recruiting chemokines
correlating with hepatic immune cell accrual, increased expression of
ﬁbrosis-associated genes and worsened ﬁbrosis as indicated by
increased cholangiolar prolife rations accompanied by thicker
collagenous pericellular ﬁbers and overall increased NAS severity.
Lastly, in the context of chemical perturbations combined with WD
diet induced obesity, Tn housing decreases serum ALT which correlates
with a decrease in hepatic immune cell accrual and modiﬁed immune
cell inﬂammatory capacity. Collectively, theseﬁndings demonstrate for
the veryﬁrst time that thermoneutral housing has broad, yet divergent
effects on hepatic immune cell in ﬂammation and hepatocellular
damage across existing experimental NAFLD models in C57BL/6
mice. As studies utilizing ther moneutral housing become more
prevalent, insights gained may serve as a foundation for interrogation
of mechanisms instructing immune cell function and development of
future therapies to NAFLD.

food and water, and bred at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center (CCHMC) in a speciﬁc pathogen-free (spf) facility. Only 8-
week-old WT male mice were used in our studies. For our studies, 6-
week old mice were maintained at Ts or placed at thermoneutral (Tn;
30°C with 30% humidity) conditions for 2 weeks to allow acclimation
prior to the initiation of dietary challenge. Tn housing was
accomplished using Caron chambers (Caron Products & Services,
INC). For all studies, food and water were replaced weekly. Body
weight was recorded weekly. Corn cob bedding was used in the
housing of all mice. All animal care was provided in accordance with
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All studies
were approved by the Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical
Center IACUC.
Chow diet
WT C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were fed CD (fat 13.5% kcal,
carbohydrate 59% kcal, protein 27.5% kcal; LabDiet 5010) and housed
at either Ts or Tn as controls to speciﬁc dietary challenge experiments.
Methionine-choline deﬁcient diet
WT C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were fed MCD diet (MCD;
Research Diets #A02082002B; 16% Protein, 63% Carbohydrate and
21% Fat kcal/gram) and housed at either Ts or Tn for 4 or 10 weeks as
previously described (10, 23).
NASH diet
WT C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were fed a NASH diet (40% kcal
fat, 20% kcal fructose, and 2% kcal cholesterol by weight; Research
diets, D09100301) and housed at either Ts or Tn for 22 weeks as
previously described (24).
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)
WT C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were fed CD. CCl4 (Sigma-
Aldrich, 289116-100ML) was injected with the dose of 2 µl (0.32
µg)/g of body weight, of CCl4 or olive oil (control) i.p. 2x weekly for
3 weeks.
Western diet + carbon tetrachloride (WD+CCl4)
WT C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were fed a WD (21.1% fat, 41%
Sucrose, and 1.25% Cholesterol by weight; Teklad diets, TD. 120528)
and a high sugar solution (23.1 g/L d-fructose and 18.9 g/L d-glucose)
in drinking water. CCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 289116-100ML), 0.2 µl (0.32
µg)/g of body weight or corn oil (control) was i.p. injected once per
week, as previously described (5, 24) for 12 weeks.
Hepatic immune cell isolation
Hepatic immune cells were isolated using Miltenyi Biotec
Gentlemax technology followed by Percoll gradient. Brieﬂy, whole
liver was homogenized using Miltenyi Gentlemax C tubes using
RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum. After resuspension, cells were
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. Cell pellets were
homogenized in a 33% Percoll solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in
RPMI medium 1640 (Gibco). Following gradient separation, and
lysing of red blood cells, hepatic in ﬁltrating immune cells were
subsequently analyzed byﬂow cytometry (3, 25, 26).
Hepatic function
Hepatic triglycerides (TGs) were quantiﬁed using Triglyceride
Reagent and Triglyceride Standards (Pointe Scientiﬁc). Serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST)
were quantiﬁed using ALT Reagent, AST Reagent and Catatrol I and
II (Catachem). For histology, liver tissue wasﬁxed in 10% buffered
formalin, and stained with H&E or Masson’s trichrome and evaluated
by a board-certiﬁed pathologist (3, 24).
Hepatic immune cell characterization
To determine immune cell population single cell suspensions
derived from hepatic tissues, isolated immune cells were labeled with
monoclonal antibodies. For cytokine production, total single cells
were stimulated for 4 hours with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA; 50 ng/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and Ionomycin (1
mg/ml) (EMD Millipore), in presence of Brefeldin A (10 mg/mL)
(GoldBio). Subsequently, data were collected using an LSR Fortessa
(BD) and Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) and analyzed using
FlowJo X software (vX10).

Our initial investigation focused on determining the impact of Tn
housing on liver damage at homeostatic conditions. Tn housing did not
impact body weight and promoted a sligh tr e d u c t i o ni nw e tl i v e rw e i g h t s ,

inﬂammatory responsiveness and accelerates NAFLD pathogenesis (3),
we next examined the impact of Tn housing in a model of obesogenic
diet-driven NAFLD, a diet rich in cholesterol and sugars that has been
postulated to mimic human disease (27– 29). To mimic these conditions,
Ts and Tn housed C57BL/6 wild type male mice were fed a NASH diet
for 22 weeks (Figure 1A). Tn housed mice, compared to Ts housed
counterparts, had increased totalbody weight gain over time (p=0.01)
(Figure 1B). Further examination of visceral white adipose tissue (WAT)
depots revealed that Tn housing dominantly impacted perirenal WAT fat
redistribution (p=0.04) rather thaninguinal and epididymal WAT depots
(Supplementary Figure 2A).
Given the observed changes in obesity and adiposity in Tn housed
mice, we analyzed the impact of Tn housing on gross liver histology.
Obesity is associated with ectopic fat deposition in the liver, thus the
impact of Tn housing on NASH diet-driven hepatic steatosis and
hepatocellular damage was examined. Both Tn and Ts housed, NASH
diet fed mice displayed equal presence of classic large droplet
macrovesicular steatosis (LD-MS; a single large steatotic droplet
replaces nearly the entire cytoplasm and pushes the nucleus
peripherally) and small droplet macrovesicular steatosis (SD-MS;
numerous smaller droplets of fat that replace essentially the entire
cytoplasm and expand the cell) ( Figures 1C , D) (see arrows).
Congruently, both Tn and Ts housed, NASH diet fed mice had similar
wet liver weights (Supplementary Figure 2B)a n dh e p a t i ct r i g l y c e r i d e
accumulation ( Supplementary Figure 2C ). However, additional
histological examination revealed that despite similar hepatocyte
ballooning, Tn housed NASH-diet-fed mice, compared to Ts housed
counterparts, exhibited increased focal lobular inﬂammation (p=0.05),
and had an overall increase in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) severity
(p=0.04) (Figures 1C, depicted in E) (see arrows). Lastly, in agreement
with histological analyses, the Tn housed, NASH diet fed mice, compared
to Ts housed counterparts, had exacerbated serum alanine transaminase
(ALT) levels (p=0.01) (Figure 1F).
Hepatocellular damage is closely linked with altered hepatic
inﬂammation. Hence, we next examined the impact of Tn housing on
NASH diet-driven hepatic in ﬂammation, hepatic immune cell
composition and immune cell inﬂammatory capacity. Tn and Ts
housed, NASH diet fed mice had similar hepatic mRNA expression of
Tnfa,ap r o i nﬂammatory cytokine that contributes to hepatic
inﬂammation and damage ( 30, 31)( Supplementary Figure 2D ).
However, Tn housing increased hepatic mRNA expression of immune
cell recruiting chemokines Ccl2 (p=0.000009) and Ccl3 (p=0.04)
(Supplementary Figure 2E). Subsequent analysis of the immune cell
composition demonstrated that Tn housing promoted an increase in
total hepatic immune cell accrual (p=0.04) in context of NASH diet
feeding (Supplementary Figure 2F). Cellular characterization of hepatic

immune inﬁltrate in Tn housed NASH-diet-fed mice, compared to Ts
housed counterparts, revealed speciﬁc increase in frequencies and
absolute numbers of macrophages (CD45+CD11b+F4/80+) (p=0.03)
and neutrophils (CD45+CD11b+Gr1+) (p=0.03), but reduced frequency
of CD4+ T cells (CD45+CD3+CD4+)( Figure 1G and Supplementary
Table 1, for gating strategy seeSupplementary Figure 3). However,
despite the apparent changes in hepatic immune cell composition, the

ionomycin stimulation (Supplementary Figures 2G, H)w a ss i m i l a ri n
Tn and Ts housed, NASH diet fed mice.
Prolonged hepatic in ﬂammation induces tissue damage and
development of hepaticﬁbrosis (32, 33). However, traditional HFD
feeding does not induce robust hepaticﬁbrosis in C57BL/6 wild type
mice under Ts housing conditions. Notably, diets high in cholesterol
and sugar (i.e., fructose and sucrose) content are known to yield
upregulation of pathways associated with ﬁbrosis and promote
histological patterns of ﬁbrosis that mimic ﬁbrosis-like
characteristics seen in human disease (34, 35). Hence, the impact of
Tn housing on hepatic ﬁbrosis was examined. Tn and Ts housed
NASH-diet-fed mice had similar expression of ﬁbrosis associated
genes Col1a1 , Col1a2 and Acta2 in the liver ( Supplementary
Figure 2I). Congruently, both Tn and Ts housed, NASH diet fed
mice had minimalﬁbrosis in association with periportal cholangiolar
reactivity as determined by trichrome staining ( Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure 2J).
NAFLD is also associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and
insulin signaling, both of which contribute to development and
severity of metabolic syndrome (36, 37). Obesity in particular is
associated with dysregulation o f lipid metabolism and insulin
signaling pathways (36, 37). Hence, the impact of Tn housing on
pathways associated with lipid metabolism and insulin signaling were
next examined. Notably, Tn and Ts housed, NASH diet fed mice,
despite differences in NAFLD severity, had similar hepatic expression
of insulin signaling (Pparg and Irs1) and lipid metabolism-associated
genes (Lxra, Lipe, Chrebp, andSrebp)( Supplementary Figures 2K– L).
Tn housing augments MCD diet driven
myeloid immune cell accrual in the liver and
exacerbates liver disease pathogenesis
Increased incidence of NAFLD is reported to also occur in the
absence of obesity (38). Using the MCD diet model of NAFLD, which
induces weight loss but promotes hepatic steatosis, inﬂammation, and
hepatocellular damage, we next examined whether Tn housing
enhanced NAFLD pathogenesis in an obesity independent setting.
Tn and Ts housed C57BL/6 wild type male mice were fed MCD diet
for 4 weeks (Figure 2A). Tn housing did not impact MCD diet driven
weight loss – a key characteristic of MCD diet feeding (Figure 2B).
Hepatic triglycerides levels were similar despite increased liver to
body weight ratio (p=0.005) in Tn housed, MCD diet fed mice
(Supplementary Figures 4A, B). However, histopathological analyses
revealed that Tn housed, MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts housed
counterparts, exhibited a higher macrovesicular steatosis grade
(p=0.04) (Figures 2C, D, see green arrows). In addition, Tn housed,
MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts housed counterparts, had
increased overall hepatocellular damage as evidenced by increased
focal in ﬂammation (p=0.003) and necr osis (acidophil bodies)
(Figure 2E, see red arrows), and a signi ﬁcant increase in NAS
severity (p=0.004) (Figure 2C), but had similar ALT and Aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) levels ( Figure 2F and Supplementary
Figure 4C ). Tn housed, MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts
counterparts, exhibited comparable hepatic expression levels of
Tnfa, Ccl2 and Ccl3in total liver tissue (Supplementary Figures 4D,
E). Similarly, analysis of the immune cell composition showed
comparable numbers of total hepatic immune cells (Supplementary
Figure 4F). Characterization of hepatic immune cell inﬁltrate revealed
that Tn housing in combination with MCD diet feeding promoted a
speciﬁc increase in frequencies and absolute numbers of macrophages
(frequency p=0.01; absolute # p=0.01) and neutrophils (frequency
p=0.0002; absolute # p=0.001) and a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells absolute numbers (Figure 2G and Supplementary Table 2).
Nevertheless, despite the changes in hepatic immune cell
composition, the inﬂammatory capacity of these cells followingex
vivo PMA/ionomycin stimulation was not altered (Supplementary
Figures 4G, H).
MCD diet is a well-accepted experimental model of hepatic
ﬁbrosis (9, 39, 40). Whether Tn housing modiﬁes development of
hepatic ﬁbrosis in the context of MCD feeding is unknown. Tn and Ts
housed, MCD diet fed mice exhibited similar hepatic expression of
ﬁbrosis associated genes Col1a1 , Col1a2 and Acta2 (p=0.18)
(Supplementary Figure 4I). Nevertheless, Tn housed, MCD diet fed
mice, compared to Ts housed counterparts, had worsened hepatic
ﬁbrosis as indicated by increased cholangiolar proliferations
accompanied by thicker collagenous pericellularﬁbers (Figures 2C,
H, see green arrows). MCD diet does not induce metabolic syndrome
(9, 41). We next examined whether Tn housing would be sufﬁcient to
alter the expression of lipid metabolism- and insulin signaling-
associated genes linked with metabolic syndrome in NAFLD (36,
37). Notably, Tn and Ts housed, MCD diet fed mice, despite
differences in NAFLD severity, exhibited similar hepatic expression
of insulin signaling (Pparg and Irs1) and lipid metabolism-associated
genes (Lxra, Lipe, Chrebp, andSrebp)( Supplementary Figures 4J, K).
Prolonged MCD feeding exacerbates NASH pathology (10). To
further deﬁne the impact of Tn housing on prolonged MCD-driven
NAFLD, C57BL/6 wild type mice were housed at Tn and Ts and fed
MCD diet for 10 weeks (Supplementary Figure 5A). Similar to 4
weeks of MCD diet feeding, no differences in weight loss over time
between Tn and Ts housed mice were observed (Supplementary
Figure 5B ). Tn housed, MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts
counterparts, had decreased liver to body weight ratio (p=0.003)
and similar total hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared to Ts
housed counterparts (Supplementary Figures 5C, D), but displayed
exacerbated steatosis percentage (p=0.03) (detected in 85-95% range)
(Supplementary Figure 5E ). Additional histological examination
revealed that Tn housed, MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts
housed counterparts, had increa sed hepatocellular ballooning
(p=0.01), multifocal lobular inﬂammation (p=0.01), and the overall
NAS severity (p=0.005) (Supplementary Figure 5E), yet ALT and AST
remained similar (Supplementary Figures 5F, G). Further, extended
MCD diet feeding in Tn housed mice resulted in signi ﬁcantly
increased hepatic expression of Tnfa (p=0.004), Ccl2 (p=0.02) and
Ccl3 (p=0.01) (Supplementary Figures 5H– I). Despite similar absolute
numbers of total hepatic immune cells (Supplementary Figure 5J), Tn

housed, MCD diet fed mice, compared to Ts housed counterparts,
had a signi ﬁcant increase in hepatic frequency of macrophage
(p=0.001) and neutrophil (p=0.01) accrual ( Supplementary
Figure 5K). Surprisingly, hepatic macrophages isolated from these
mice had uniquely blunted in ﬂammatory capacity (p=0.003)
following ex vivo PMA/ionomycin stimulation, a ﬁnding not seen
in CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Figures 5L, M). Lastly, although
prolonged MCD diet feeding of mice housed at Tn increased the
hepatic expression of Col1a1 (p=0.02) and Col1a2 (p=0.01)
(Supplementary Figure 4N), such induction did not yield robust
histological differences in hepatic ﬁbrosis at the conclusion of the
study (Supplementary Figure 5E).
Tn housing restricts WD+CCl4 driven liver
disease pathogenesis
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a prominent hepatotoxin known to
drive robust hepatic inﬂammation, damage, and ﬁbrosis (9, 40, 42,
43). Thus, we next examined how Tn housing shapes CCl4 treatment-
driven liver damage. C57BL/6 wild type mice were housed at Tn
andTs and treated with CCl 4 i.p. 2 times a week for 3 weeks
(Supplementary Figure 6A). Both Tn and Ts housed mice treated
with CCl4 had similar body weights at the conclusion of the study
(Supplementary Figure 6B) and hepatic immune cell accrual that
correlated with extensive hepatocellular necrosis ( Supplementary
Figures 6C, D, see yellow arrows). However, despite similar disease
pathology, Tn housed mice treated with CCl4, compared to Ts housed
counterparts, had reduced ALT levels (p=0.001) ( Supplementary
Figure 6E). In addition, CCl4 treatment induced comparable hepatic
Tnfa and Ccl2 and Ccl3 expression in both Tn and Ts housed mice
(Supplementary Figures 6F, G), similar hepatic immune cell accrual
(Supplementary Figures 6H , I), and hepatic immune cell
inﬂammatory capacity following ex vivo stimulation with PMA/
ionomycin (Supplementary Figures 6J, K). CCl4 is also a potent
driver of hepaticﬁbrosis. Analysis of the whole liver tissue showed
similar expression of ﬁbrosis associated genes (Col1a1, Col1a2 and
Acta2)( Supplementary Figure 6L) in Tn and Ts housed mice treated
with CCl 4, which also correlated with similar induction of
sinusoidal ﬁbrosis as determined by histopathological analyses
(Supplementary Figure 6M).
Western Diet (WD) feeding coupled with low dose CCl 4
administration (WD+CCl 4) more accurately recapitulates the
histopathological manifestati ons of NASH with progression to
cirrhosis (5). Hence, C57BL/6 wild type mice housed at Tn and Ts
conditions were fed a WD coupled with low dose of CCl 4

administration for 12 weeks (Figure 3A). Tn housing did not impact
total body weight gain over time (Figure 3B), wet liver weights or
hepatic triglyceride accumulation (Supplementary Figures 7A, B).
Congruently, Tn housed mice receiving WD+CCl4, compared to Ts
housed counterparts, had similar distribution of small droplet
macrovesicular steatosis and large droplet macrovesicular steatosis
(Figures 3C, D, see arrows). Additional histopathological analyses
revealed that Tn housed, WD+CCl 4 treated mice had increased
hepatocellular ballooning (p=0.04), but similar distribution of
inﬂammatory foci and similar overall NAS severity (Figures 3C, E,
see green arrows). Similarly, to CCl4 treatment alone, Tn housed, WD
+ CCl4 treated mice exhibited decreased serum ALT (p=0.01) but not
AST levels (Figure 3Fand Supplementary Figure 7C). Tn housed, WD
+CCl4 treated mice, compared to Ts housed counterparts, also had
increased hepatic Tnfa, (p=0.03) Ccl2 (p=0.007) and Ccl3 (p=0.02)
expression (Supplementary Figures 7D, E). Subsequent analyses of the
immune cell composition revealed Tn housing coupled to WD+CCl4
treatment decreased absolute number of hepatic immune cells
(p=0.05) ( Supplementary Figure 7F ), most prominently in the
macrophage compartment (p=0.03) (Figure 3G and Supplementary
Table 3). Nevertheless, Tn housing did not impact macrophage
inﬂammatory capacity but rather modi ﬁed the in ﬂammatory
capacity of CD4
+ T cells following ex vivo stimulation with PMA/
ionomycin (p=0.001) ( Supplementary Figures 7G , H). We next
examined if Tn housing modiﬁed WD + CCl4 treatment driven
hepatic ﬁbrosis. Increased hepatic expression of ﬁbrosis (Col1a1,
(p=0.31) Col1a2 (p=0.51), Acta2 (p=0.05)), cell regeneration (Ccnd1
(p=0.002) and Ki67 (p=0.0005)) and HCC-associated genes (Afp
(p=0.009) and H19 (p=0.12)) was observed in Tn housed, WD +
CCl 4 treated mice, compared to Ts housed counterparts
(Supplementary Figures 7I , K). Nonetheless, robust histological
differences in pericellular delicate ﬁbrosis (see green arrows) or
HCC development as indicated by similar presence of nuclear
atypia (see yellow ovals) at the conclusion of the study were not
observed (Supplementary Figure 7L). Lastly, as in other experimental
models of NAFLD (Figures 1 and 2), Tn housing did not modify
hepatic expression of insulin signaling ( Pparg and Irs1) or lipid
metabolism-associated genes ( Lxra, Lipe , Chrebp ,a n d Srebp )
(Supplementary Figures 7M, N).
Discussion
In this comparative study, we built upon our previousﬁndings
that demonstrated the ability of Tn housing (which allows for
physiological responses to in ﬂammatory stimuli) to modify key
inﬂammatory responses associated with HFD driven NAFLD
development and progression. Here we add to that knowledge by

showing that Tn housing also modiﬁes liver disease hallmarks in
multiple experimental mouse models of NAFLD.
HFD feeding is favored in experimental models of NAFLD as it
induces robust obesity, obesity-associated metabolic sequelae, and
hepatic steatosis. However, a major shortcoming of this model is that
even prolonged feeding does not induce severe steatohepatitis or
hepatic ﬁbrosis (40, 44). NASH diet is composed of high fat content
coupled to high content of carbohydrates– a dietary composition that
more accurately mimics human dietary intakes and is believed to
more closely recapitulate NAFL D development progression.
However, an apparent caveat of this model is that the higher
cholesterol content is overwhelming and does not represent
physiological levels found in human diets ( 45). Overnutrition,
commonly seen in diet induced obesity models, signiﬁcantly alters
cellular metabolism (46). Altered cellular metabolism profoundly
shapes immune cell function (24, 46). Speciﬁcally, in the context of
NAFLD, obesity drives ectopic fat deposition into the liver and
subsequent immune cell in ﬁltration ( 47, 48). Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that Tn housing was sufﬁcient to augment obesity,
ALT, hepatic immune cell accrua l and the overall liver tissue
damage in during NASH diet feeding. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate
that Tn housing was sufﬁcient to not only promote increased obesity
over time but to also increase hepatic accrual of macrophages and
neutrophils which correlates with elevated ALT and the overall NAS
severity. However, the signaling mechanisms shaping the altered
NAFLD kinetics and severity under Tn housing conditions that
uniquely promote increased hepatic myeloid cell accrual remain
unknown. During NASH/NAFLD, liver resident macrophages
(Kupffer cells) decrease and are replaced by recruited circulating
monocyte-derived macrophages. These macrophages are distinct
from Kupffer cells, and their presence is associated with worsened
liver disease (49). If and how Tn housing modiﬁes the recruitment of
these distinct macrophage populations and their functional
capabilities is unknown. In addition, investigation of the impact of
Tn housing on environmental cues or other non-immune cell factors
which may contribute to worsened disease pathogenesis is warranted.
Tn housing was not sufﬁcient to induce hepaticﬁbrosis under NASH
diet feeding conditions. Hence, future studies should focus on the role
of Tn housing on activation of other liver resident cells known to
contribute to ﬁbrosis development including stellate cells ( 50).
Additionally, the contribution of other immune cells to hepatic
inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis outside the scope of this study should be
investigated (51– 54).
Although MCD diet induces robust hepatic steatosis,
inﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis, a major disadvantage of this model is
that it induces chronic weight loss and lacks the presence of metabolic
syndrome – parameters frequently associated with obesity-driven
liver disease in humans. However, given the increase in cases of
non-obese individuals with NAFLD or“lean NAFLD,” this model is
again garnering more attention (55, 56). Notably, lean (BMI<25kg/
m2) and non-obese (BMI<30kg/m2) individuals with NAFLD make
up 5.1% and 12.1% of all NAFLD cases respectively in the general
population (57). These individuals, in addition to liver disease, display
worse type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease,
and ﬁbrosis compared to their obese counterparts (58, 59). Such
reports seemingly uncouple obesity from NAFLD and validate the use
of MCD as a tool to understand disease progression in“lean NAFLD”.
We show that Tn housing in context of MCD diet was sufﬁcient
to amplify hepatic steatosis, hepa tocellular ballooning, lobular
inﬂammation, overall NAS severity, and hepaticﬁbrosis. Moreover,
these effects were ampliﬁed under Tn conditions after prolonged
exposure to MCD diet feeding. However, we did not observe
differences in ﬁbrosis during prolonged MCD diet exposure. Given
that observed reduction in macrophage inﬂammation under these
conditions, prolonged exposure to MCD-driven NAFLD milieu could
contribute to immune cell exhaustion and diminished hepaticﬁbrosis
(60). Notably, combined de ﬁciency of choline and methionine
impairs b-oxidation and decreases secretion of VLDL contributing
to increased fatty liver, cytokine secretion, in ﬂammation, and
development of ﬁbrosis (9). Additionally, b−oxidation regulates
immune cell inﬂammation and function (26, 61, 62). If and how Tn
housing regulates b-oxidation, subsequent immune responses and
VLDL secretion remains unknown.
Chemicals such as CCl4 are effective triggers of hepaticﬁbrosis
and have been heavily utilized to study liver disease progression.
Cellular toxicity, a major caveat of this method, is known to induce
generation of reactive metabolites, ROS, oxidative stress and
imbalances in cellular damage and regeneration. These processes
can subsequently activate hepatic stellate cell proliferation and
induce development and progression of hepatic ﬁbrosis (42, 63).
We show that both Tn and Ts housing in the context of high dose
CCl
4 administration drive similar hepatocellular necrosis andﬁbrosis.
Despite the histopathological similarities, Tn housing blunted
systemic ALT level. ALT, abund antly found in the cytosol of
hepatocytes, is released upon hepatocellular damage and has a half-
life of approximately 47 hours in the blood, with levels varying 10-
30% within a given day (64). Whether the ALT levels are attributed to
altered cycles of hepatocellular regeneration under Ts and Tn housing
conditions remains unknown. Housing temperature also regulates
inﬂammatory signaling cascades (e.g., NF-kB, TNFa IL-6) that drive
the initial priming necessary to stimulate hepatocyte regeneration
(65). As such, the contribution of Tn housing to hepatocellular
damage and regeneration in the context of CCl4 treatment warrants
further investigation. Additionally, although ALT is often recognized
as reliable marker of liver disease, ALT levels do not always directly
correlate with disease progression. In the context of hepatitis B and C
infection, some individuals display normal ALT levels even with the
presence of advancedﬁbrosis (66, 67). As such, despite the invasive
nature of the procedure, liver biopsy remains the gold standard in
determining NAFLD diagnosis and disease severity.
Recently, low dose CCl4 in combination with WD feeding
(containing cholesterol) is utilized to induce hepatic ﬁbrosis and
mimic human NASH in C57BL/6 wild type mice – a process
uncharacteristic of WD feeding alone (5). Diet induced obesity is a
known modi ﬁer of hepatic immune cell accrual including
macrophages, which is further exacerbated under Tn housing
conditions. Interestingly, in the context of Tn housing our data
shows a reduction in total hepatic macrophage accrual in WD
+CCl4 treated mice. CCl4 treatment modiﬁes immune cell function
(43, 68). How Tn housing modulates hepatic immune cell function
during WD+CCl4 combination remains to be studied. Although no
differences in histologicalﬁbrosis were observed, increased expression
of ﬁbrosis, cell proliferation and HCC-associated genes under Tn
conditions was noted. These data suggest that prolonged exposure
Oates et al. 10.3389/ﬁmmu.2023.1095132
Frontiers inImmunology frontiersin.org09
may be needed to fully uncover Tn housing mediated WD+CCl4
treatment effects on ﬁbrosis. Overall, our ﬁndings with WD+CCl4
agree with published reports (5), apart from serum ALT analysis. We
show that WD+CCl4 elevates serum ALT in Ts conditions over the
control group (WD+Oil). This could be due in part to differences in
host gut microbiome, time of day of serum collection or
hepatocellular cycles of damage and regeneration (69– 71). In the
context of Tn housing, we demonstrate that WD+CCl4 treatment
blunts ALT levels. These data suggest that under Tn conditions the
WD feeding may contribute to activation of other mechanisms
subsequently offering some protection against the observed
increased ALT seen in Ts housed counterparts. However, it should
be noted that hepatic histopathological manifestations due to CCl4
use are not consistent with NAFLD histopathology seen in humans.
Hence, these key limitations should be accounted for when using CCl4
to model NAFLD associated histopathology.
The molecular mechanisms that contribute to NAFLD
progression are still under investigation. Steatosis development is
due in part to both extra- and intrahepatic processes. Hormone
sensitive lipase (HSL) regulates adipose tissue TG hydrolysis into
free fatty acids (FFAs) which are subsequently taken up by the liver
(72, 73). Insulin inhibits HSL activity during feeding, hence during
the low insulin fasting state HSL activity is increased and facilitates
fatty acid release (72). Indeed, inhibition of HSL in mice decreases
plasma FFA concentration and reduces hepatic steatosis (72, 74).
Additionally, rest (i.e., non-exercise conditions) prompts fatty acid
(FA) release and creates an imbalance of FAs in circulation versus
their rate of oxidation. In our studies no signiﬁcant changes in hepatic
HSL (Lipe) or insulin signaling activity (Irs1 and Pparg) between Ts
and Tn housed groups were observed. These data suggests that Tn
housing does not dominantly impact TG hydrolysis into FFA and
subsequent uptake by the liver contributing to hepatic steatosis. It
may be that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which regulates intravascular
hydrolysis of plasma chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL) into FAs for subsequent uptake by the adipose tissue and the
liver, may be modiﬁed by Tn housing (72). In fact, in experimental
models of atherosclerosis Tn housing has been shown to alter low-
density lipoprotein composition (15). However, given limited changes
in expression of insulin signaling genes between Ts and Tn housed
groups in our models (something that promotes LPL activity (72),
such studies require further investigation. Intrahepatic perturbation
in lipid metabolic processes can also regulate hepatic steatosis. High
sucrose feeding has been shown to promote steatosisvia de novo
lipogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase causes
hepatic entrapment of glucose and subsequently promotesde novo
lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis. Indeed, carbohydrate-responsive
element-binding protein ( Chrebp ) is activated by glucose and
promotes de novo lipogenesis (75). Yet, our data does not uncover
differences inChrebp between Ts and Tn housed groups. Analysis of
other genes known to regulate lipid lipogenesis including sterol
regulatory element binding protein and liver x receptors (Srebp and
Lxra)( 76, 77) similarly did not reveal difference in expression
between Ts and Tn housed groups. Collectively, these studies may
suggest that Tn housing possibly regulates development of hepatic
steatosis via novel mechanisms. Of note, dietary insults may regulate
DNA methylation which heavily relies on S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) availability and methyl donors from foods. Deﬁciency in
folate, one of such methyl donors, is known to contribute to
hepatic triglyceride accumulation via regulation of fatty acid
synthesis genes (78, 79). Thus, whether Tn housing modiﬁes diet
associated regulation of epigenetic mechanisms contributing to
NAFLD is underdeﬁned.
Housing temperature exerts profound effects in shaping immune
responsiveness. Cold stress is associated with norepinephrine release,
activation of beta-adrenergic receptors on immune cells and
subsequent regulation of immune cell function (80). In the context
of HFD driven NAFLD, Tn housing signiﬁcantly lowered expression
of genes central to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and beta 3 adrenergic
receptor signaling. Moreover, Tn housing resulted in lower serum
concentrations of the immunosuppressive glucocorticoid
corticosterone and expression of genes that inhibit inﬂammation
(GR and beta 2 adrenergic receptor ( b2AR) in the spleen ( 3).
Notably, immune cells deﬁcient in GR orb2AR exhibit exacerbated
inﬂammatory cytokine production following LPS stimulation (81,
82). Additionally, sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from Ts and Tn housed mice showed that Tn housing promoted
increased expression of genes that negatively regulate immune
responses (3). Whether the same mechanisms are conserved in
other experimental models of NAFLD remains underdeﬁned and
should be examined.
Temperature modiﬁes epigenetic regulation of immune response.
It has been reported that optimally (25°C) challengedﬁsh displayed
increased IgM + B cell secretion, macrophage in ﬂammation and
recovery following viral infection compared to sub-optimally (17°C)
challenged ﬁsh. Notably, ﬁsh that survived infection during a
suboptimal challenge exhibited signiﬁcantly increased H3 and H4
histone modiﬁcations compared to that of optimally challengedﬁsh.
Speciﬁcally, they found that suboptimal challenge resulted in H3K9ac
displaying transcriptional com petency, activation of trained
immunity H3K4me3, and enric hment of H3 histone-lysine 4
mono-methylation (H3K4me1), a nd a robust re-stimulatory
immune response. Essentially, all assayed H4 modiﬁcations were
signi ﬁcantly higher in sub-optimally challenged infected ﬁsh
compared to optimally challenged infected ﬁsh. Moreover, these
ﬁsh had more methylation along cytosine residues compared to
optimally challenged ﬁsh, suggesting the role of epigenetics and
subsequent activation of trained immunity in convalescing sub
optimally challenged ﬁsh (83). Thus, temperature may act as a
potent regulator of epigenetic mechanisms contributing to
regulation of immune responses during viral infection. Whether Tn
housing modiﬁes epigenetic activity in murine immune cells and their
contribution to NAFLD pathogenesis represents an attractive area
of investigation.
Febrile response to infection is preserved in mammals with
evidence invoking existence of beneﬁcial response to infection (84).
In fact, the available data suggests that an elevated temperature (37.5°
C to 39.4°C) in ICU patients is associated with better outcomes to
infectious insult compared to normothermia or hyperthermia (above
40°C) (84– 86). In elderly, increased pneumonia related mortality is
observed in those who lacked fever (29%) compared to those who
developed a febrile response (4%). Thus, tese data suggests that
internal temperatures may indeed impact the immune response or
slow pathogen virulence. However, there is insuf ﬁcient data to
determine the impact of environmental temperature on modulation
Oates et al. 10.3389/ﬁmmu.2023.1095132
Frontiers inImmunology frontiersin.org10
of immune responses and deve lopment of disease, speci ﬁcally
NAFLD, under steady state conditions in humans. Importantly,
divergence in dietary consumption and lifestyle among various
populations, given its relevance to NAFLD development, represents
a key obstacle in addressing the impact of temperature on NAFLD
severity in humans. Hence, additional epidemiological studies are
required across various geographical landscapes to begin to draw
correlations between NAFLD prevalence and climate.
In summary, our data demonstrates that Tn housing modiﬁes
hepatic immune cell accrual, lobular in ﬂammation, ﬁbrosis and
overall ampli ﬁes liver tissue damage severity in experimental
models of NAFLD in mice. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that Tn
housing modiﬁes hepatic immune cell inﬂammation across all models
studied. Further investigation is required to complete in depth
characterization of immune cell subsets and their genomic and
transcriptional landscapes. These data are relevant for future
comparisons of immune response in experimental models with
human disease. Thus, the utility of thermoneutral housing as a
means of modeling physiological murine immune responses to
various in ﬂammatory stimuli is becoming more recognized.
Together, the initialﬁndings of our studies when coupled to future
investigation on this topic might serve as a foundation for
interrogating how Tn housing instructs immune cell function in the
context of liver in ﬂammation and disease in multiple settings.
Collectively, these insights may allow for the development of future
therapies to NAFLD via improved understandings of immune
mechanisms underlying disease development and progression.
