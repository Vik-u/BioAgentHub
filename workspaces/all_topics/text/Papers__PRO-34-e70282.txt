Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most significant plastic pollut-
ants. Unlike other plastic polymers, PET can be degraded by PET-hydrolytic
enzymes (PETases). Over the past two decades, numerous publications
have reported the discovery, characterization, and engineering of PETases.
This review thoroughly examines the sequence, structure, and functional
diversity of naturally occurring PETases. To achieve this, we compiled data
from 48 publications into a single table. The resulting dataset enabled us to
contextualize previously reported features and shed light on the sequence–
structure–function relationships of PETases. Finally, we review selected
engineering campaigns and suggest future directions for the enzymatic
recycling of PET under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, aiming to
understand the gaps to tackle the PET pollution crisis.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Plastics have become ubiquitous in human life due to
their durability, flexibility, and inexpensive production.
Although introduced only around 70 years ago (Geyer
et al., 2017), today plastic contaminates every natural
habitat— from the tallest mountains (Napper et al.,
2020) to the deepest parts of the oceans (Chiba
et al., 2018), as well as our food and our bodies
(Toussaint et al.,2019). Global plastics production has
now exceeded 400 million metric tons (MT) annually.
Further, it is expected to reach 700 million MT by 2030,
which equates to around 80 kg of plastic produced per
person on Earth (Britt et al.,
2019). Clearly, the impact
on the environment will only worsen without recycling.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a plastic com-
posed of two fossil-fuel-based monomers, ethylene gly-
col (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA), linked by ester
bonds (Pang et al.,
2016). PET accounted for
approximately 10% of the total plastic production by
mass between 2002 and 2014, making it the fourth
most produced plastic (Geyer et al., 2017; Stubbins
et al.,2021). PET is primarily used for food packaging,
bottles, and fibers (Welle, 2011). It accounted for
44.7% of single-serve beverage packaging in the
United States in 2021 (Benyathiar et al.,
2022).
Recently, governmental awareness of the urgency of
plastic recycling, for example, the 2018 European Strat-
egy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, encouraged tax-
ing non-recycled plastics (Pazienza & De Lucia,
2020),
increasing the demand for recycled PET (Tournier
et al.,
2023).
The most widely used process, thermal recycling of
PET, involves melting and reshaping the polymer
(Altun & Ulcay,
2004). This process, however, has a
crucial limitation: PET can only endure a certain num-
ber of cycles before it needs to be downcycled into
lower-value products like fibers, which are not

recyclable (Tournier et al.,2023). In contrast to thermal
recycling, enzymatic degradation breaks the ester
bonds linking PET monomers, which can then be puri-
fied and polymerized into new PET without losing qual-
ity (Uekert et al.,
2022). Thus, theoretically, enzymatic
PET recycling could be repeated infinitely without
compromising the plastic’s quality and functionality.
In 2005, a cutinase from Thermobifida fusca was
reported as the first enzyme capable of effectively
hydrolyzing PET film (Müller et al.,
2005). Over the
past 20 years, numerous PET-degrading enzymes
(PETases) have been discovered and engineered
(Arnal et al.,
2023; Duan et al., 2023; Satta et al.,
2024). Additionally, organisms such as Ideonella
sakaiensis (Yoshida et al., 2016) have been found to
degrade and utilize PET as a carbon source, thereby
opening up the possibility for cell-based catalysis. With
the launch of Carbios— the first commercial company
focused on enzymatic PET recycling — the field has
begun transitioning from research to industrial applica-
tion (Johnson, 2024; Tournier et al., 2020). Carbios’s
patent portfolio covers key aspects of PET bio-recycling
at an industrial scale, including proprietary enzyme
cocktails (Boisart & Maille,2018), multi-enzyme degra-
dation strategies (Guemard & Dalibey,2022), synergis-
tic surface-binding protein combinations (David et al.,
2020), and substrate pretreatment processes that
enhance enzymatic PET hydrolysis (Desrousseaux
et al.,2022). Some challenges, however, still hinder the
adoption of biodegradation as a viable strategy to miti-
gate PET pollution, namely, the degradation of crystal-
line PET and the development of even more efficient
and stable PETases than currently available.
The growing potential of enzymatic recycling and
the pressing problem of PET pollution have spurred sci-
entific research; more than 250 publications regarding
PETases have been published in PubMed in the last
5 years. This abundance of studies highlights the need
for a comprehensive review, which might aid in shaping
the future of research in this area and directing
resources effectively to advance PET biodegradation.
Previous research articles and reviews have examined
various aspects of the sequence and structural diversity
of a subset of PETases (Duan et al.,
2023; Erickson
et al.,2022; Khairul Anuar et al.,2022; Liu et al.,2023;
Wei et al.,2022); in 2022, the Plastics-Active Enzymes
(PAZy) database was created, containing sequence
and taxonomy information of plastic-degrading
enzymes, including PETases (Buchholz et al.,
2022).
However, a systematic analysis that includes function,
beyond sequence and structure, is still missing.
To achieve this, we created the PETase Activity
Natural Dataset (PANDA), which contains the functional
information of 99 different naturally occurring PETases
(up to October 2024) and one engineered enzyme
(LCC_ICCG), a benchmark in the field (Erickson
et al.,
2022; Makryniotis et al., 2023; Tournier
et al.,2020) (Supplementary Table1). In this review, any
enzyme degrading PET analogs with two or more TPA
moieties is referred to as a PETase, regardless of
whether PET is the enzyme’s natural or preferred sub-
strate, or the efficiency of degradation. Five enzymes in
PANDA do not include sequence and structure informa-
tion, as they are not publicly available. We excluded
enzymes whose activity was not tested when pure. In
this way, each record in PANDA represents a pure
PETase’s biochemical activity in one experiment,
resulting in 244 records from 48 publications (Arnling

et al., 2022, 2024; Zhou et al.,2024). This information
allowed us to summarize previous concepts and shed
light on PETases’sequence, structure, and functional
diversity. See Supplementary Texts
1–3 and Supple-
mentary Table2 for further details on data collection and
processing. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the
current status of engineered PETases within mesophilic
and thermophilic ranges, examining the industrial poten-
tial of each approach. Other reviews focusing mainly on
engineered enzymes can also be checked (Barclay &

et al.,2022; Yao et al.,2024).
2 | PET-DEGRADING ACTIVITY IS
ACCESSIBLE FROM DIVERSE SEQUENCE
BACKGROUNDS
The amino acid sequence diversity of PETases has
been assessed using sequence similarity networks
(SSNs) (Erickson et al.,2022; Perez-Garcia et al.,2023;
Qi et al.,2023; Seo et al.,2025) and phylogenetic trees
(Erickson et al., 2022; Joo et al., 2018;K a r u n a t i l l a k a
et al., 2022; Mamtimin et al.,2024; Yao et al.,2024).
SSN analyses consistently showed PETases group into
2o f1 4 AHITUV ET AL.

3–5 clusters, with 2–8 enzymes remaining as singletons
(Erickson et al., 2022; Perez-Garcia et al., 2023;Q i
et al.,2023; Seo et al.,2025). Moreover, the SSN analy-
sis by Perez-Garcia et al. (2023) further suggested that
the clustering aligns with the enzymes’taxonomic origin.
Enzymes within each cluster share sequence identity
above a user-defined threshold. The presence of multi-
ple clusters and singletons demonstrates that not all
PETases share high sequence similarity. This may indi-
cate that the PETase function, whether a result of posi-
tive selection or of promiscuous activity, is readily
available in enzymes from different origins.
Through PANDA, these trends can be visualized and
quantified. Indeed, PETases show high sequence diver-
sity; pairwise alignments show that 54% of pairs are less
than 30% identical, and 38% are less than 20% identical.
Four enzymes— IS11, RmL, CbotuEstA, and LipMRD9—
share less than 25% identity with any other enzyme in
the dataset. The SSN of PANDA at the lowest sequence
identity threshold (/C24 20%) groups them into three clusters
and five singletons, which include the four enzymes men-
tioned above (Figure
1a). As previously shown by Perez-
Garcia et al. (2023), two clusters in the SSN of PANDA
align with the taxonomic kingdom: cluster 1 (74/94
enzymes, 78.7% of PANDA) includes bacterial and one
archaeal PETase, and cluster 2 (9/94, 9.6% of PANDA)
includes mainly fungal PETases. The enzymes in Cluster
3 (7/94, 7.4% of PANDA), however, separate from Clus-
ter 1 despite being of bacterial origin. The enzymes in
this cluster catalyze a PET trimer (3-PET) as a substrate
or exhibit marginal activity toward larger PET polymers.
This suggests that taxonomic origin is not the only clus-
tering determinant, and that SSNs could perhaps distin-
guish between enzymes acting on small PET molecules
and enzymes degrading larger PET polymers. Further
research outside the scope of this review is needed to
verify these observations. Finally, we noted that enzymes
in different clusters significantly differ in size: cluster
2 contains the smallest PETases (median 19.96 kDa;
e.g., Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis cutinase, 19.6 kDa), clus-
ter 1 contains medium-sized PETases (median
28.55 kDa; e.g., LCC, 27.9 kDa), and cluster 3 contains
large PETases (median 34.3 KDa; e.g., enzyme
101, 32.1 kDa) (Supplementary Figure
1).
As most PETases belong to cluster 1, we resolved
a higher-resolution SSN (/C24 50% sequence identity) of
FIGURE 1 PETases sequences cluster according to taxonomic origin. (a) Low-resolution SSN (alignment score threshold= 1, ≈20%
sequence identity) of 94 PETase sequences and three enzymes acting on PET degradation products: MHETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis
(Yoshida et al.,2016), and two BHETases fromBacillus subtilisand Chryseobacterium sp. PET-29 (Li et al.,2023). Cluster 1 includes bacterial
enzymes and one archaeal enzyme. Cluster 2 consists of fungal enzymes and one bacterial enzyme. Cluster 3 contains PETases tested against
PET trimer (3-PET), PETases with marginal activity against PET polymer, and the two BHETases. Four PETases and the MHETase remained
as singletons. (b) High-resolution SSN (alignment score threshold= 80, ≈50% sequence identity) of the enzymes in cluster 1. Here, PETases
group according to taxonomic class. Distinct clusters are observed for PETases fromActinomycetes and PETases fromProteobacteria. (a) and
(b) SSN analysis of PETase sequences was performed using the EFI-SSN web server (Gerlt et al.,2015) using default parameters.

this cluster. Two distinct sub-clusters, 10 singletons,
and four pairs can be observed (Figure1b). Here, clus-
tering aligns with taxonomic class; the two largest sub-
clusters belong to Proteobacteria and Actinomycetes,
respectively. Interestingly and as previously shown
(Joo et al.,
2018; Meyer Cifuentes et al.,2022; Zhang
et al., 2022), the taxonomy-based clustering correlates
with structural features described by Joo et al. (2018)
and Duan et al. (2023); Type I PETases with one disul-
fide bond and shorter loops are found in the actinomy-
cetes sub-cluster, while Type II PETases from the
proteobacteria sub-cluster feature an additional disul-
fide bond and extended loops.
Similarly to SSNs, phylogenetic analyses of
PETases and related sequences have shown that
PETases are spread across different clades, aligning to
some extent with their taxonomic origin (Erickson
et al.,
2022; Joo et al.,2018; Karunatillaka et al.,2022;
Mamtimin et al.,2024; Yao et al.,2024). To verify and
generalize these results, we searched for PETase
homologs using all sequences from clusters 1 and
2 (Figure 1a) as queries and performed phylogenetic
analyses. In both the bacterial and archaeal tree
(Figure 2) and the fungal and actinomycetes
tree (Supplementary Figure 2), PETases are spread
across multiple clades. However, specific clades are
more enriched with PETases. In the fungal tree, a sin-
gle clade within the Sordariomycetes class contains
most cluster 2 PETases (6/9, 67.7%). In the bacterial
tree, two clades belonging to theActinomycetes and
Proteobacteria phyla (marked i and ii, respectively, in
Figure 2) are significantly enriched with PETases, col-
lectively containing 50 of the 74 PETases from cluster
1. Clade i contains TfCut2 fromThermobifida fusca, the

class of the source organism when available. Clades i and ii are enriched with PETases. The tree was calculated using IQ-tree (Minh et al.,

first PETase to be discovered (Müller et al.,2005), and
clade ii contains IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis
(Yoshida et al.,2016), which received wide attention as
the first enzyme whose PET degradation capabilities
were shown to serve a physiological role. The fact that
many novel PETases were found using sequence simi-
larity to TfCut2 and IsPETase could account for this
enrichment (Danso et al.,
2018; Eiamthong et al.,2022;
Erickson et al., 2022; Han et al., 2024; Hong
et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Ribitsch, Herrero Acero,
Greimel, Dellacher, et al., 2012; Ribitsch, Herrero
Acero, Greimel, Eiteljoerg, et al., 2012; Sagong
et al., 2021; Wei et al.,2014). Because (a) structure-
based searches (Wu et al.,2024), (b) sequence-based
searches using less studied PETase (Brinch-Pedersen
et al.,
2024), and (c) environmental sampling (Distaso
et al., 2023; Perz et al.,2016; Sulaiman et al.,2012)
have been conducted, 44 out of 94 PETases (/C24 47% of
the PETases in PANDA) are not found in these primary
clades, showing that the PETase function is available
for enzymes from different origins. Whether the capac-
ity to degrade PET has physiological relevance remains
unknown for most PETases, as it could be a promiscu-
ous feat due to the chemical similarity between PET
and natural polyesters. Finally, the SSN and phyloge-
netic trees of PETases do not match perfectly the tree
of life. For example, one bacterial enzyme is found in
the fungal cluster (Figure
1a, cluster 2), and actinobac-
teria and proteobacteria enzymes spread across multi-
ple clades (Figure2)— suggesting that horizontal gene
transfer has played a role in the evolution of this
enzyme family.
3 | THE STRUCTURE OF PETases IS
HIGHLY CONSERVED: THE OPTIMIZATION
STRATEGIES CONVERGE
PETases usually adopt the α/β hydrolase (ABH) fold
(Billig et al.,2010; Erickson et al.,2022; Sonnendecker
et al., 2022;X ie ta l . ,2021), the most common fold for
esterases (Lenfant, Hotelier, Velluet, et al.,2013b). The
only exception is the enzyme IS11, which belongs to the
beta-lactamase/transpeptidase-like superfamily (Distaso
et al.,2023). The ABH superfamily is a prominent protein
family exhibiting sequence and functional diversity,
encompassing enzymes and non-enzymes (Lenfant,
Hotelier, Bourne, et al.,2013; Lenfant, Hotelier, Velluet,
et al., 2013). Moreover, proteins of this fold exhibit pro-
miscuity (Marchot & Chatonnet,2012) and remarkable
plasticity, as few mutations can cause an enzyme to
change its function (Li et al.,
2008; Padhi et al.,2010;
Rauwerdink & Kazlauskas, 2015). PETases are no
exception as they have been shown to degrade other
natural and synthetic poly- and monoesters such as cutin
(Kleeberg et al.,
2005; Sulaiman et al.,2012), cellulose
acetate (Shirke et al., 2017), polyethylene-
2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF) (Austin et al.,2018), poly-
caprolactone (PCL) (Sulaiman et al.,2012), and various
para-nitrophenyl ester substrates (Yoshida et al.,2016;
Zhang et al.,2024). This suggests that the capacity of
some enzymes to degrade PET did not evolve by strong
positive selection but is rather a result of the promiscuous
activity of flexible active sites. Moreover, these observa-
tions align with PETases’high sequence diversity; natu-
ral promiscuity could explain how PETase activity
emerged from different members of the ABH family.
ABHs occasionally possess additional domains like
caps, lids, and binding domains (Bauer et al.,
2020;
Khan et al.,2017). Most PETases, however, lack these
additional domains. Given the bulkiness of PET, extra
domains could hinder substrate access to the active
site (Khairul Anuar et al.,
2022). Erickson et al. (2022)
and Perez-Garcia et al. (2023) identified and discussed
some exceptions.
At a systematic level, Erickson et al. (2022) identi-
fied numerous active PETases (38.4% of PANDA).
They analyzed their structures, showing that most have
high structural similarity to known PETases, while some
exhibit truncations or extensions. An all-versus-all
structural comparison of PETases from PANDA— using
AlphaFold models for all enzymes— shows the same
trend. As with many protein families (Higgins &
Carrington,
2014; Illergård et al., 2009; Ingles-Prieto
et al., 2013), the structural similarity of PETases is
higher than the sequence identity (Figure3). The con-
servation in structure, despite moderate sequence
identity, has allowed beneficial mutations to be trans-
posed between PETases, enhancing their activity. For
example, Tournier et al. (
2020) introduced a disulfide
bridge from TfCut2 into LCC, resulting in LCC-ICCG.
Weigert et al. (2022) successfully introduced mutations
inspired by IsPETase into the wild-type PETase PET6.
Fritzsche et al. (
2023) and Pfaff et al. (2022) success-
fully introduced mutations inspired by DuraPETase, a
variant of IsPETase, to the enzymes LCC-ICCG and
PES-H1 (referred to as PHL7 in PANDA), respectively.
Moreover, Wang et al. (
2025) showed that a lysine
mutation in a specific position improved the activity of
six PETases. The alignment of several prominent engi-
neered enzymes to enzyme 611 (Erickson et al.,
2022),
a naturally occurring cluster 1 PETase, highlights and
generalizes this trend (Figure
4 and Supplementary
Table 3). Indeed, many previously identified beneficial
mutations could be transposed, demonstrating the
practical potential of PETases’structural similarity.
4 | COMPARING PETases IS POSSIBLE
DESPITE HIGHLY VARIABLE
EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
The PANDA dataset is unique in that it includes bio-
chemical activity. This could enable rankings,

potentially guiding the selection of candidates for fur-
ther engineering. However, PETases have been tested
in highly variable experimental conditions, making
direct comparisons of their activities challenging (Arnal
et al.,
2023; Wei et al., 2022). Although side-by-side
comparisons of selected enzymes can address this
issue (Arnal et al., 2023; Norton-Baker et al., 2024),
this approach is impractical for the 99 enzymes identi-
fied in PANDA. To overcome this limitation, we propose
using comparative rankings. For example, if enzyme A
FIGURE 3 The structural similarity between PETases exceeds sequence identity while maintaining the same groupings. (a) sequence
identity matrix of all PETases in PANDA, calculated using Clustal Omega (Madeira et al.,2024). (b) Structure similarity matrix based on LDDT
scores (Mariani et al.,2013), calculated using Foldseek (van Kempen et al.,2024). To reduce variability, Alphafold2 predictions (Jumper
et al.,2021) were used for all PETases in the dataset even when experimental structures were available. Black squares correspond to Clusters
1, 2, and 3 from the SSN analysis (Figure1). Selected enzymes are labeled to enhance interpretability.

performs better than B in one experiment and B better
than C in another, it might be possible to infer that A is
also better than C (A >B >C). This might not always be
true; for example, a slower but more stable enzyme
might outperform a faster enzyme in a long reaction but
not in a shorter one (Bell et al.,
2022). Substrate vari-
ability could have the same effect, as some enzymes
have higher specificity toward PET film over PET pow-
der or vice versa (Erickson et al.,2022). The extent to
which such variability affects cross-experiment compar-
isons is still unknown.
To assess the robustness of enzyme rankings
across variable experimental setups, we analyzed data
by Erickson et al. (2022), where a set of 19 enzymes
were tested in different conditions. We ranked the
enzymes in each condition and analyzed how the rank-
ings correlate using the Kendall Tau coefficient
(Kendall,
1938). Despite the variability in substrate and
reaction duration, even the lowest observed correlation
(Kendall-τ = 0.47) indicated a reasonable likelihood
(73.5%, given by the formula p ¼τþ1
2 ) of consistent
rankings across experiments, enabling approximate
comparisons of PETase activity (Supplementary
Figure 3). A detailed explanation of the analysis is
available in Supplementary Text4.
To identify promising enzymes from PANDA using
comparative rankings, a set of highly active enzymes
serving as references must be defined. We analyzed
results from another experiment by Erickson et al.
(
2022), where 38 PETases were tested at their optimal
temperature and pH. We classified the 11 top perform-
ing as “highly active” (top /C24 30%). Then, we searched
the rest of PANDA (61/99 enzymes) for enzymes tested
against one of the 11 references when both were
tested in their optimal conditions. Nine additional
enzymes performed comparably or better. All 20“highly
active” enzymes (20.2% of the enzymes in the dataset)
are shown in Figure
2, with their thermostability repre-
sented by color: thermophilic enzymes (optimal temper-
ature ≥50
/C14 C) are shown in red, and mesophilic
enzymes (optimal temperature ≤40/C14 C) are shown in
blue. Supplementary Table4 contains names and ther-
mostability classification of the highly active enzymes.
The visualization of the function in the phylogenetic tree
of Figure2 shows that evolutionary origin and PETase
high activity do not strictly correlate, suggesting that
sequence information alone cannot be used to identify
promising candidates and that highly active PETases
may reside in less explored clades, as recently shown
by Seo et al. (
2025).
5 | ENGINEERING PETases FOR
INDUSTRIAL PET RECYCLING
The first sections of this review focus on wild-type
enzymes, showcasing the best naturally occurring
PETases. In this section, we review the current state of
PETase engineering, distinguishing between: (1) degra-
dation in mesophilic conditions — dominated by the
engineered variants of IsPETase — which provide
the opportunity to integrate living cells into the recycling
process, and (2) degradation in thermophilic
conditions— dominated by the engineered variants of
LCC— allowing PET recycling using pure enzymes and
high temperatures. Detailed experimental data of the
enzymes mentioned in this section are available in
Supplementary Table
5.
The engineering of mesophilic PETases was
boosted by the discovery of the above-mentioned IsPE-
Tase in 2016, which exhibits high specificity toward
PET (Yoshida et al.,2016). The enzyme was isolated
from Ideonella sakaiensis , a mesophilic bacterium
found in a bottle recycling facility, which can utilize PET
as a sole carbon and energy source. IsPETase has
been extensively engineered, yielding improved vari-
ants with enhanced activity in thermophilic conditions
(Bell et al.,
2022; Cui et al.,2021; Joho et al.,2023,
2024; Lee et al.,2023; Lu et al.,2022; Shi et al.,2023;
Son et al.,2019). Two of these, however, proved very
efficient in mesophilic conditions as well. In 2020, the
enzyme FAST-PETase was developed, containing five
mutations compared to IsPETase (N233K, R224Q,
S121E, D186H, R280A), identified using a structure-
based machine learning algorithm (Lu et al.,
2022).
FAST-PETase produced /C24 6 times more degradation
products compared to the wild type after 96 h of incuba-
tion at 30
/C14 C with PET amorphous film (Lu et al.,2022).
Furthermore, in 2023, Lee et al. ( 2023) engineered
Z1-PETase, containing 13 mutations compared to
IsPETase— four of which are found in FAST-PETase
(S121E, D186H, N246D, S242T, P181V, A180V,
N37D, R132E, R224E, and disulfide bonds, N233C-
S282C and A171C-S193C). Z1-PETase degraded
/C24 75% of amorphous PET powder in 96 h at 30
/C14 C (Lee
et al.,2023) and produced/C24 4 times more degradation
products than the WT after 12 hours of incubation at
30/C14 C with amorphous PET powder (Lee et al.,2023).
Enzymes functioning in the mesophilic temperature
range (between 25 and 37/C14 C) allow for the use of living
cells as whole-cell biocatalysts, opening the door to
combining multiple processes in a single bioreactor.
For example, this approach would enable organisms to
metabolize PET degradation monomers into valuable
products without multiple reaction vessels and purifica-
tion steps. This concept was exemplified by Werner
et al. (
2021), who engineered Pseudomonas putida
KT2440 to produceβ-ketoadipic acid from PET, which
can then be used to produce nylon (Ackermann
et al.,2024; Elmore et al.,2021). Additionally, the work
of Tiso et al. (2021) demonstrated upcycling PET into
two types of bioplastics.
Although FAST and Z1-PETase are suitable
enzymes and the proof of concept for the production of
AHITUV ET AL. 7o f1 4

commodity metabolites from PET fermentation has
been shown, the upcycling of PET in mesophilic condi-
tions faces two significant challenges: First, scaling up
the production of valuable secondary metabolites from
the PET monomers, such asβ-ketoadipic acid, is cru-
cial for developing a process that is both efficient and
viable for industrial applications (Crater &
Lievense,
2018). Second, current mesophilic PETases
have not yet achieved the degradation rates necessary
to meet industrial demands (Bl /C19azquez-S/C19anchez
et al.,
2022).
Along these lines, another approach to enzymatic
PET degradation involves using thermophilic PETases,
which can function effectively at PET’s glass transition
temperature (Tg)— /C24 65–75/C14 C for amorphous bulk PET
(Arnal et al.,2023; Kawai et al.,2014; Thomsen, Alm-
dal, & Meyer, 2023). At temperatures near PET’s Tg,
the increased mobility of polymer chains in amorphous
regions enhances degradation by facilitating enzymatic
access to the ester bonds. Researchers have aimed to
enhance PET degradation by engineering PET hydro-
lase enzymes with increased thermal stability, allowing
them to remain active and efficient in elevated
temperatures.
One of the first thermophilic enzymes discovered is
the heavily researched Leaf Branch Compost Cutinase
(LCC), identified from a metagenomic sample of leaf
branch compost in 2012 (Sulaiman et al.,
2012). LCC
has a melting temperature (Tm) of 84.7/C14 C (Tournier
et al., 2020) and can degrade 1.45 mg of PET after
24 h of incubation at 50/C14 C (Sulaiman et al.,2012). In
2020, the engineered enzyme LCC-ICCG was devel-
oped, containing four mutations compared to LCC
(F243I, D238C, S283C, Y127G), which raised its Tm to
90.9
/C14 C. LCC-ICCG degraded 86% of amorphized post-
consumer PET powder after 24 h of incubation at 72/C14 C
in a bioreactor experiment, compared to 55% by WT
LCC in the same conditions (Tournier et al.,2020). In
2024, LCC-ICCG was redesigned using three rounds of
protein engineering assisted by molecular dynamics
analysis, resulting in the creation of LCC-A2, which
contains two mutations compared to LCC-ICCG
(H218Y and N248D). This enzyme has a Tm of
95.25
/C14 C and can degrade more than 90% of pretreated
postconsumer PET in 3.3 h at 78/C14 C. LCC-A2 created
1.4 times more degradation products than LCC-ICCG
after 10 h of incubation at 72/C14 C (Zheng et al.,2024). It
has been shown to exhibit the highest activity when
compared to 14 other thermophilic PETases under con-
ditions of 70
/C14 C and pH 7.5 (Norton-Baker et al.,2024).
These engineering efforts enabled the industrial uti-
lization of thermophilic enzymes. The company Car-
bios, founded in 2011, utilizes a variant of the enzyme
LCC-ICCG to depolymerize pre-treated PET. In 2023,
Carbios had a recycling capacity of approximately
250 kg of plastic daily (Buranyi,
2023). While celebrat-
ing Carbios as the first company to apply enzymatic
degradation for PET recycling, there is still enormous
potential for improvement in fully utilizing enzymatic
PET degradation. For instance, challenges remain in
addressing high-crystallinity PET in both mesophilic
and thermophilic ranges (Thomsen, Almdal, &
Meyer,
2023), improving PET degradation efficiency in
the mesophilic range even with amorphous PET, and
exploring the mineralization of PET through whole-cell
biocatalysts. These challenges can be tackled by vari-
ous strategies beyond improving the catalytic activity of
a single enzyme. These include employing bacterial
communities (Gao & Sun,
2021; Roberts et al.,2020),
using enzyme cocktails (Maity et al.,2021), and incor-
porating adhesion molecules and binding proteins
(Rennison et al., 2023). The integration of these
strategies— better explained in the next section— holds
significant promise toward a sustainable and efficient
approach to PET recycling, contributing to a more sus-
tainable future.
6 | FUTURE DIRECTIONS TO MEET THE
CHALLENGES OF PET ENZYMATIC
RECYCLING
Finally, after reviewing and commenting on PETase’s
discovery and engineering, we propose some future
directions for addressing the challenges of the PET
enzymatic recycling industry:
1. Crystalline PET Degradation: No enzyme has been
identified that can effectively degrade the crystalline
regions of PET polymers (Schubert et al.,
2024).
Addressing this challenge is critical for PET recy-
cling without labor- and energy-intensive pre-
treatment processes (Uekert et al., 2022). Nature
offers a promising model in the form of cellulosome
complexes, where multiple enzymes and binding
modules collaborate to break down the crystalline
regions of cellulose (Artzi et al.,
2017). Although
PET is more hydrophobic than cellulose, a similar
multi-enzyme approach has been suggested for
PET degradation (Gulati & Sun,
2024; Yan
et al.,2021). This strategy would involve combining
different enzymes, each specializing in degrading
the PET polymer or its short-chain constituents. For
example, IsPETase was fused to MHETase using
flexible glycine-serine linkers (Knott et al.,
2020;
Zhang et al., 2023) or other methods (Chen
et al., 2022), resulting in improved hydrolysis.
Fusion of PETase with binding modules that
increase enzyme affinity to the PET surface, such
as hydrophobins and carbohydrate binding mod-
ules, was successfully demonstrated as well in
some cases (Jia et al.,
2024; Li et al., 2024;
Rennison et al., 2023; Ribitsch et al.,2015), while
others questioned their contribution in industrially
8o f1 4 AHITUV ET AL.

relevant conditions (Graham et al.,2022; Rennison
et al.,2024). Combining these approaches by fusing
different enzymes with binding modules could have
a positive effect by increasing enzyme-substrate
interactions and tailoring enzyme functions. Such
integrated systems may help overcome the chal-
lenges posed by PET crystallinity and significantly
enhance overall degradation efficiency.
2. The role of PETase half-life: Enzyme kinetic stabil-
ity, measured by half-life, is critical in designing
enzymes for industrial applications as it lowers the
enzyme amount required for the degradation pro-
cess, making it more economically viable. Conse-
quently, extending the half-life of PETases could
significantly affect both the scalability and sustain-
ability of enzymatic PET recycling, complementing
the current emphasis on thermal stability. While
most research has focused on enhancing thermody-
namic stability (commonly assessed via melting
temperature, Tm), less attention has been given to
increasing enzyme half-life under actual degrada-
tion conditions. Although these two stability parame-
ters can sometimes be related, they often stem from
distinct mechanisms and do not necessarily corre-
late (Brissos et al.,
2014; Xie et al., 2014). The
importance of improving PETase half-life is exempli-
fied in the work of Bell et al. (2022), which compared
the performance of HotPETase (Tm of 82.5/C14 C) and
LCC-ICCG (Tm of 90.9/C14 C) at 65/C14 C. After approxi-
mately 5 h, HotPETase produced/C24 2.2 times more
degradation product than LCC-ICCG. However,
after /C24 24 h, LCC-ICCG matched and eventually
surpassed HotPETase in degradation product yield
due to the latter’s shorter half-life under the experi-
mental conditions (Bell et al.,
2022). This example
highlights the crucial role of enzyme half-life in
PETase engineering campaigns and underscores
the need to include half-life as a key parameter for
optimizing industrially viable PETases.
3. The optimal temperature for PET degradation:A s
mentioned above, PETases are often engineered
for greater thermostability (Bell et al.,
2022;L u
et al., 2022; Norton-Baker et al., 2024; Tournier
et al.,2020), with melting temperatures (Tm) reach-
ing up to 98/C14 C (Tournier et al.,2020). In tempera-
tures near PET ’s Tg, the degradation rate is
enhanced due to increased reaction kinetics and
polymer chain mobility (Akram et al.,2024). How-
ever, the increased chain mobility at Tg enables the
reordering and crystallization of chains in the amor-
phous phase — a process known as physical
aging— compromising degradation efficiency
(Thomsen, Almdal, et al., 2023a). One proposed
solution is engineering enzymes with enhanced cat-
alytic rates that outcompete the recrystallization rate
(Arnal et al.,
2023). However, as degradation occurs
at the surface while recrystallization also affects the
bulk, such enzymes must be remarkably fast. An
alternative approach considers the plasticizing
effect of water, which lowers the surface Tg of PET
to 45 –48
/C14 C (Akram et al., 2024; Tarazona
et al., 2022). This suggests that degradation just
below bulk Tg may balance chain mobility at the sur-
face for effective degradation while minimizing bulk
recrystallization (Kawai et al.,
2024; Thomsen, Alm-
dal, & Meyer, 2023; Thomsen, Schubert, et al.,
2023). Prioritizing between fast degradation and
complete depolymerization should guide the selec-
tion of the optimal temperature and, accordingly, the
engineering of enzymes.
7 | CONCLUDING REMARKS
Systematically reviewing all known PETases, consider-
ing their sequence, structure, taxonomic source, and
function, provides a comprehensive overview of wild-
type PETases. PETases appear to have emerged from
multiple origins while maintaining sufficient structural
similarity to transfer function- or stability-enhancing
mutations. Such transfers can guide PETase engineer-
ing campaigns, an essential step toward adapting wild-
type PETases to industrially relevant conditions.
Observing enzyme activity in the context of phyloge-
netic distribution reveals that highly active enzymes
emerged from diverse evolutionary backgrounds. This
indicates high levels of evolutionary convergence and
shows that sequence-independent search methods
would facilitate the discovery of novel and diverse
PETases. Finally, our PANDA database offers a valu-
able resource for data-based applications as it is the
first to incorporate function-related data. It may contrib-
ute to identifying novel PETases, uncovering key resi-
dues and motifs critical for PET degradation, and
potentially guiding the design of de novo PETases.
