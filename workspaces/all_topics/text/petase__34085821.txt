ABSTRACT: The environmental problems derived from the
generalized plastic consumption and disposal couldﬁnd a friendly
solution in enzymatic biodegradation. Recently, two hydrolases
from Ideonella sakaiensis201-F6 and the metagenome-derived leaf-
branch compost cutinase (LCC), more specially the improved
ICCG variant, have revealed degradation activity toward poly
ethylene terephthalate (PET). In the present study, the reaction
mechanism of this polymer breakage is studied at an atomic level
by multiscale QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations, using
semiempirical and DFT Hamiltonians to describe the QM region. The obtained free energy surfaces conﬁrmed a characteristic four-
step path for both systems, with activation energies in agreement with the experimental observations. Structural analysis of the
evolution of the active site along the reaction progress and the study of electrostatic eﬀects generated by the proteins reveal the
similarity in the behavior of the active site of these two enzymes. The origin of the apparent better performance of the LCC-ICCG
protein over PETase must be due to its capabilities of working at higher temperature and its intrinsic relationship with the
crystallinity grade of the polymer. Our results may be useful for the development of more eﬃcient enzymes in the biodegradation of
PET.
■ INTRODUCTION
Management of plastic wastes accumulated in land ﬁlls
manifests as one of the major challenges pending to be
seriously faced in the near future. Only 15% are recycled in
Europe
1 and less than 10% are recycled worldwide. 2 Poly
ethylene terephthalate (PET) accounts for the sixth most-
produced polymer and the most commonly manufactured
thermoplastic, principally for packaging purposes.
3 Of the total
amount produced, almost 42% was recycled in the EU in
2017.
4,5 However, its diﬃculty to be chemically broken into
monomers leaves the mechanical reconversion as the principal
technique available. Nevertheless, physical properties are
inevitably lost after the process, so it may not be suitable for
the production of many products (such as the ubiquitous
transparent bottles), thus keeping virgin polymer as an
irreplaceable source. There is a pressing necessity to ﬁnd
manners to depolymerize PET into its raw materials and to do
it in a more environmental-friendly way as with the current
combinations of mechanical and chemical processes.
6
In this context, enzymatic degradation arises as an ideal
solution to the problem. A lot of work in this direction has
been carried out in the recent years.
7−10 One of the most
recent outstanding discoveries in thisﬁeld was reported on the
mesophilic bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, revealing the
ability to grow in PET environments, degrading, and using it as
a carbon energy source.
11 The study of this microorganism
revealed a synergic behavior of two enzymes, a PET hydrolase
(PETase) and a mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydro-
lase (MHETase). Isolation and characterization of the former
protein conﬁrmed its responsibility of the chemical breakage of
the plastic polymer into monomers, principally MHET. Then,
MHETase is capable of breaking this molecule into ethylene
glycol and terephthalate, two compounds that can be
metabolically assimilated. PETase is currently the best wild-
type protein known that can work for this purpose under mild
conditions (40°C). Consequently, many eﬀorts have been put
in trying to improve its e ﬃciency and understanding its
behavior.
12−20 Another interesting enzyme with hydrolytic
properties against PET can be found on the metagenome-
derived leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC).
21,22 This
alternative enzyme possesses improved thermophilic proper-
ties, capable of working at up to 80°C. This is a feature with
two beneﬁts: higher temperatures facilitate larger turnover
numbers because of kinetic principles and can also suppose a
crucial factor when trying to address the main body of PET.
Polymers can appear in a variable crystallinity grade, and it has
been shown that the higher the content of the amorphous
phase in the plastic, the higher the enzyme activity. Being

closer to the glass transition temperature for PET, established
at around 60 −80 °C in water, 23 may provide a higher
percentage of the amorphous phase in the plastic and foster the
chain mobility between the core and the protein-accessible
surface. Recently, a mutation over its sequence (F243I/
D238C/S283C/Y127G) has been claimed to obtain a
remarkable 98-fold improvement in performance.
24
PETase and LCC can be considered among the most
promising candidates available for the PET hydrolysis. Both
are structurally similar, with an identity of 49.5% and aα-/β-
hydrolase fold with a core of seven α-helices and nine β-
strands. They share the same classic nucleophile-histidine-acid
catalytic triad, with serine and aspartic acid residues (PETase:
S160/H237/D206, LCC: S165/H242/D210).
9 The classic
four-step mechanism proposed for this type of enzymes relies
on the acylation of the serine, concomitant with the breaking
of the polymer, followed by its hydrolysis assisted by a water
molecule of the solvent (Scheme 1).
25 The attack of the ester
bond of the polymer by the serine forms a tetrahedral
intermediate (TI 1), and then, theﬁrst product of the reaction,
MHET (or a fragment of the polymer, depending on the
length of the initial polymeric chain and the breaking site), is
released, and anacyl-enzyme intermediate (AI) is formed. The
liberation of a molecule of MHET from the active site
facilitates the pose of a water molecule that can perform a
backwards process. This is the attacking of the new ester bond
of the AI to form a secondarytetrahedral intermediate (TI 2)
that isﬁnally decomposed to release the second product of the
reaction: another MHET molecule (or a shorter polymeric
chain).
Apart from structural speculation from crystallographic
electron density maps, very few pieces of explicit evidence of
the mechanism are available in the literature for these two
enzymes.
12−16,19,26 Some computational attempts to elucidate
the docking of the polymer to the PETase have already been
published,
12,14 although some have confronted severe exper-
imental disagreements.27 Classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations have also been used to try to determine the
inﬂuence of the residues on the active site and itsﬂexibility
15,16
and in the case of the LCC protein to model the
accommodation of its substrate. 24 However, the catalytical
mechanism has not yet been theoretically studied for any PET-
breaking enzyme. In the case of MHETase, the reaction
mechanism of the hydrolysis of a MHET molecule catalyzed
by this protein from I. sakaiensis has been recently explored
with QM/MM methods by Knott et al.
28 Employing
semiempirical force ﬁelds (SCC-DFTB), they reported a
two-step serine hydrolase mechanism, where both the
formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate (acylation) and
its subsequently hydrolysis (deacylation) take place as single
steps, without any stable tetrahedral intermediates. According
to the authors, the deacylation step arises as the rate-limiting
step for the MHET breakage process, with a free energy barrier
of 19.8 kcal·mol
−1 at 30 °C.28
This paper focuses on studying the mechanism of action of
the PETase enzyme and the LCC-ICCG variant at an atomistic
level by means of multiscale QM/MM MD simulations.
Independent calculations were carried out using a dimer and a
trimer of PET as the substrate. Based on the results, the same
mechanism was explored for the LCC-ICCG protein with a
dimer. Free energy surfaces (FESs) in terms of potential of the

mean force (PMF) have been obtained, thus allowing a
detailed description of the mechanism. The results, after a
successful comparison with the available experimental data,
may be valuable to propose possible mutations, leading to
more eﬃcient PET-degrading enzymes.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mechanism of PETase/MHET2. Our ﬁrst goal was to
describe the mechanism of hydrolysis of PET catalyzed by
PETase. For this purpose, a model of this system was prepared
with a dimer (MHET
2) manually docked in the active site of
the enzyme, as described in the Computational Methods
section. The substrate is broken symmetrically in such a way
that two MHET molecules are obtained at the end of the
reaction, consistent with the evidence that this is the major
product of the enzyme.
11 To carry out the simulations, a
temperature of 313 K was chosen, being the optimal one for
the protein eﬀectiveness.
9
An important condition in the setup is regarding the
orientation of the substrate in the active site, which determines
which ester group will be hydrolyzed. Little experimental
information is available, with only a monomer of the plastic
(MHET) and an analogous molecule ( p-nitrophenol)
successfully crystalized in the active site.
13 The consensual
disposition for the PETase considers theﬁrst ester group after
the aromatic ring as the most suitable for the nucleophilic
attack.9 This scheme allows an un-hindered accessibility to the
serine. The aromatic ring of the ligand also correctly disposes
to interact with the nearby Tyr-87 and Trp-185, and the
substrate ﬁts adequately to the oxyanion hole formed by the
backbone nitrogen atoms of Tyr-87 and Met-161. Therefore,
this is the disposition that was used in our simulation, as
displayed in Figure 1a.
The M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p):AM1/MM FESs for the whole
reaction mechanism are shown inFigure 2. The corresponding
PMFs at the AM1/MM level are deposited in theSupporting
Information (Figure S6). As can be observed, the surfaces
conﬁrm that the reaction mechanism consists of four steps. In
the ﬁrst step, the nucleophilic attack of the Ser-160 to the
ester’s carbon atom of the polymer occurs in a concerted
manner with the proton transfer from Ser-160 to His-237.
According to the results, theﬁrst reaction proceeds with a free
energy barrier of 17.7 kcal·mol
−1, leading to the formation of
the tetrahedral intermediate 1 (TI 1), 14.4 kcal·mol−1 less
stable than the reactants.
The second stepleads to a stableacetyl-enzyme intermediate
(AI) through the breaking of the ester bond of the polymer
concomitant with the serine−substrate bond formation. The
exergonic reaction liberates 17.7 kcal·mol
−1 and needs 5.9 kcal·
mol−1 to reach the transition state, TS 2, in a concerted
fashion. After the reaction, the leaving group (a molecule of
MHET) is removed from the active site, and the system is re-
equilibrated with unconstrained AM1/MM MD simulations
(see the Computational Methods section for details).
For the third step, a solvent water molecule accesses the
active site from the same side as the catalytic triad to allow
keeping the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the
acyl-enzyme and the oxyanion hole provided by the Tyr-87
and Met-161 backbone in the opposite side. The water oxygen
bounds to the carbonyl carbon of the remaining substrate that

is attached to Ser-160. Concertedly, water ’sp r o t o ni s
transferred to the His-237 nitrogen atom. Thus, a second
tetrahedral intermediate (TI 2), similar to the one obtained
after the ﬁrst step, is reached. According to the FES of the
reaction, an activation energy of 16.9 kcal·mol−1 is required.
Finally, in thefourth step, the second product is released in
the form of another MHET molecule, and the enzyme returns
to its initial state, ready for another catalytic cycle. This last
concerted step, requiring an energy of 5.0 kcal·mol−1, is clearly
exergonic: 17.1 kcal·mol−1.
In an eﬀort to validate the obtained results with a high level
of theory, the four transition states were optimized at the M06-
2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level. The resulting structures, charac-
terized as transition-state structures with their corresponding
single-negative frequencies ( −539.2, −539.8, −431.8, and
−420.4 cm
−1 for TS 1, TS 2, TS 3, and TS 4, respectively)
were found to be close to those selected from analysis of the
quadratic region of the corrected M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p):AM1/
MM FESs.
Mechanism of PETase/MHET
3. Despite the limited size of
a PET dimer as the substrate model in comparison with a
complete polymer structure, it must be large enough to
correctly mimic the reactive behavior of the active site.
Nevertheless, in order to explore the possible polymer chain
length dependency of our results, a second model of the
PETase enzyme was prepared with a trimer of PET (MHET
3)
as the substrate. The increased size of the substrate goes a step
forward in the modeling of a large polymeric substrate and,
according to the pose of the molecule in the active site, the
substrate−protein interactions remain equivalent. Moreover,
the resulting FESs (see Figures S3 and S7 of theSupporting
Information) are equivalent to those reported inFigure 2 for
the dimer at the same level of theory, showing energy
diﬀerences below 2 kcal·mol
−1. Comparison of the free energy
proﬁle for reaction in the PETase/MHET 2 and PETase/
MHET3 models is shown inFigure 3.
Mechanism of LCC-ICCG/MHET2. As mentioned in the
Introduction section, recent publications have moved the point
of interest of the enzymatic degradation of the PET polymer to
the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC). Being a more
thermophilic candidate for the same hydrolysis reaction, after
some mutations, it has been claimed to have better eﬃciency
while working at higher temperatures. 10,24 For a better
comprehension of this protein, the best reported variant,
denoted as ICCG (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G), was ex-
plored in the present study following the same computational
strategy as the PETase to describe its speciﬁc mechanism and
to elucidate the reason of its improved performance. As shown
in Figure 1, both active sites are nearly identical, with the same
catalytic triad and surrounding residues. Considering the
substrate length independency obtained with PETase, just a
dimer molecule (MHET
2) was used as the substrate for the
calculations, as it saves a considerable amount of computa-
tional resources.
The dimer substrate wasa priori posed in the active site of
LCC-ICCG as in the case of the PETase“normal” orientation.
Nevertheless, Tournier et al. stated that a“ﬂipped” disposition
may be more convenient for the LCC enzyme, based on
classical docking and short MD simulations.
24 With this
orientation, the second ester group should be the one to be
broken. In order to clarify this situation, both dispositions were
independently prepared and studied for the LCC-ICCG
enzyme (Figure 1c,d). The temperature of the simulations,
set to 313 K, may not take full advantage of LCC possibilities,
capable of working at up to 72 °C,
24 but ensures a fair
comparison with the results derived from the study of PETase.
Due to the high similarities of the active sites between LCC-
ICCG and PETase, the explored molecular mechanism was the
same as presented inScheme 1.I nt h eﬁrst step, the same kind
of concerted mechanism was found for both possible
dispositions of the substrate (FESs at the M06-2X:AM1/
MM level are shown in Figures S4 and S5a of theSupporting
Information, while those at the AM1/MM level are inFigure
S8). Nevertheless, a remarkable diﬀerence in energy barriers
arises. While the activation free energy of thisﬁrst step with the
“normal” orientation was 19.0 kcal ·mol−1, similarly to the
PETase, the barrier obtained with the “ﬂipped” orientations
was signiﬁcantly higher, 37.5 kcal·mol−1, far beyond reasonable
values of enzyme catalysis under normal conditions. Therefore,

the remaining steps of the mechanism were only explored with
the “normal” orientation.
The second steppresents an energy barrier of 9.0 kcal·mol−1
to reach anacetyl-enzyme intermediate (AI) with an energy of
12.1 kcal·mol−1, lower than that of the preceding tetrahedral
intermediate. In the third step, the hydrolysis of the AI to
render the tetrahedral intermediate 2 appears to be a slightly
endergonic process, 12.0 kcal·mol−1, requiring an activation
free energy of 14.0 kcal·mol−1. The fourth step appears to be

also exergonic, 15.0 kcal·mol−1, with a low barrier of 3.8 kcal·
mol−1.
PETase/MHET2 Versus PETase/MHET3 Versus LCC-
ICCG/MHET2. All three studied systems follow the same
mechanism to degrade PET, with minor variations. To directly
carry out a direct comparative analysis, the threefree energy
proﬁles are presented together inFigure 3. The rate-limiting
step for the global process, corresponding to the TS 2 in all
three systems, requires an activation free energy of 20.3, 18.9,
and 21.1 kcal ·mol
−1 for the PETase/MHET 2,P E T a s e /
MHET3, and LCC-ICCG/MHET2, respectively. The following
deacylation process needs a slightly lower activation energy,
14.0, 14.6, and 13.9 kcal·mol−1, respectively. The agreement is
highly remarkable between the calculated barriers for the
PETase with MHET
2 and MHET3 substrates, thus conﬁrming
the absence of any dependency on the length of the polymer
chain and relying exclusively on the inner radius of the active
site. Regarding the LCC-ICCG, as commented above, the
“ﬂipped” disposition (yellow line inFigure 3) clearly can be
discarded as a viable reactive complex because of the huge
energy barrier of the ﬁrst step, in contrast to the “normal”
orientation that is in the range of PETase. Thus, the apparent
performance diﬀerence between enzymes cannot be attributed
to mechanism diﬀerences.
Comparison of the mechanism described herein with the
one recently proposed by Knott et al. on the breaking of a
MHET molecule by MHETase
28 reveals signiﬁcant discrep-
ancies. According to their results, a two-step pathway for the
full reaction, without localization of intermediates in the
acylation or deacylation steps, is proposed based on free energy
surfaces at the semiempirical SCC-DFTB level of theory. In
their case, the rate-limiting step would correspond to the
deacylation, with a free energy barrier of 19.8 kcal·mol
−1, while
they predict an acylation free energy barrier of 13.9 kcal/mol.
It is important to point out that in contrast with our study, the
authors employed just two distances as reaction coordinates,
which can be the origin of certain bias. The authors also
performed experimental activity assays to determine MHET
turnover rates (k
cat) for MHETase of 27.6± 2.6 s−1 that would
correspond to an energy barrier of 15.6 kcal·mol−1.
Structural analysis of the representative structures of the key
states involved in the reaction (see Tables S1 −3 of the
Supporting Information) with the three models studied herein
reveals minor diﬀerences. The OGSer−CPET distance in the
reactant complexof the PETase-MHET2 is shorter (2.50± 0.03
Å) than the corresponding distance in the case of the larger
MHET
3 substrate (3.05 ± 0.04 Å) and the one measured in
the LCC-ICCG model (3.20± 0.04 Å). This feature could be
related with a better docking of the ligand to the active hollow.
Nevertheless, while the highest activation energy barrier of the
ﬁrst TS 1 corresponds to the LCC-ICCG system, in agreement
with the largest distance between the two atoms to be bonded
in this step, the diﬀerence between the dimer and trimer mode
of the PET model does not appear to be signiﬁcant. On the
other hand, the OG
Ser−CPET distance in the “ﬂipped”
disposition of the complex with MHET2 in the active site of
LCC-ICCG is dramatically larger (3.7± 0.05 Å). This large
distance appears to be associated to the requirements to
accommodate the substrate in the reactant groove that, in turn,
provokes the stabilization of a less-reactive conformation of the
Michaelis complex, by comparison with the case of the
“normal” orientation. As observed in Figure 3, the resulting
activation energy of theﬁrst step in the LCC-ICCG/MHET
2
in a“ﬂipped” disposition (yellow line) is dramatically higher, as
discussed above. Thus, these geometrical di ﬀerences in a
distance that deﬁnes the reaction coordinate of theﬁrst step
have an expected eﬀect on the resulting free energy barrier.
Another discrepancy between the results obtained with the
diﬀerent models is found in the timing of the events that deﬁne
the transition state of the ﬁrst step for PETase. While the
MHET3 substrate falls in the same position as the LCC-ICCG,
indicating a former stretching of the OGSer−CPET bond until
about 1.7 Å before proton transfer to the histidine, the dimer
of PETase proceeds in the other way around. However, this
fact is not reﬂected in the barrier of the step or in any other
derived property. Another relevant di ﬀerence is the ﬁnal
distance between water’s oxygen and hydrogen after the split of
the molecule in the third step. The 2.37 Å distance reached in
the LCC-ICCG/MHET
2 contrasts with the shorter 1.86 and
1.92 Å of the PETase/MHET 2 and PETase/MHET 3,
respectively. This reﬂects that the tetrahedral intermediate 2
reaches a better accommodation at the protein groove in the
LCC-ICCG model, lowering the intermediate’s free energy by
around 6 kcal·mol
−1 in comparison with its PETase counter-
parts. This over-stabilization of the intermediate structure
aﬀects the energy of the next step, overall identical among all
systems but arriving to aproduct complex with a lower net free
energy in the case of LCC-ICCG than its equivalents. The
diﬀerence observed between the ﬁnal states is virtually the
same as in the TI 2, 6 kcal·mol
−1.
The calculation of electrostatic interaction energies
between the substrate and the protein, presented by the
residue inFigure 4, allows us to get an insight into the role of
every amino acid in each stage of the reaction. The favorable
contribution of the oxyanion hole of Tyr-87/95 is present in
every system, but only in the PETase models, the Met-161/
166 has a considerable stabilization e ﬀect. The stabilizing
eﬀects of Ser-236, Ser-238, Gly-243, and Asn-244 in the
PETase/MHET
3, not observed in the dimer case, reveal the
cavity of the protein occupied by the extra monomer. No
dramatic variations are displayed between reactants/products
and transitions states, but the scenario is radically diﬀerent
after the removal of the leaving group and the inclusion of the
water molecule for the hydrolysis. This is reﬂected by the fact
that most of the stabilizing residues measured in theﬁrst two
steps present an unfavorable interaction with the substrate
once the AI is formed. Also, new inﬂuential residues emerge,
being of special relevance, Ala-183, Trp-185, and Asp-186 for
PETase and Thr-188, Trp-190, and Lys-194 for LCC-ICCG.
The case of Arg-123/131 is another example of residues
drastically changing their in ﬂuence for the hydrolysis. It
presents very high positive values of interaction, only lightly
contented for the TI 2 in LCC-ICCG, reinforcing the theory of
this over-stabilized intermediate.
Experimental Evidence. In order to validate our
computational results, a comparison against experimental
data available in the literature on these systems can be made.
A reliable way to do so is to compare our computed activation
free energies of the rate-limiting step with experimentally
determined turnover numbers. Nevertheless, due to the
polymeric nature of the substrate and a variable crystallinity
grade, this is not a simple task and not many data are available,
with inherent discrepancies between published results (Table
1). Originally, the PETase enzyme was characterized with a
turnover number of around 0.7 s
−1 for BHET molecules at 30
°C.11 Chen et al.29 reported similar rates of 0.5 s−1 for the same

3047
substrate and conditions and measured its rate with a PETﬁlm
of 45% crystallinity at 40°C with a much slower result of 10−4
s−1. A remarkable diﬀerence can be seen between polymeric
and molecular models. The comparison with rates for diﬀerent
molecules, such as pNP variants, also evidences a dependency
on the nature of the substrate.
11,29,30 Overall, it can be
concluded that our described mechanism with PETase exhibits
a free energy barrier thatﬁts in the range of the experimental
data. Unfortunately, nok
cat values are provided for the LCC-
ICCG enzyme; only the non-mutated form has been measured
with pNP, reporting similar results.
11,22
Several PETase studies have explored the e ﬀects of
mutations on the activity of the enzyme toward depolymeriza-
tion of PET, of which the most signiﬁcant are collected by
Taniguchi et al.
9 Although none of the new proteins resemble
the improvement reached by LCC-ICCG compared with its
original sequence, Ma et al.30 mutates the residue Ile-208 to
phenylalanine, reporting an activity increase by 2.5-fold,
indicating a better hydrophobic interaction with the substrate.
This is in correspondence with our computational results,
where an unfavorable electrostatic interaction is observed
between this residue and both MHET
2 and MHET3 in the
deacylation process (seeFigure 4). It is also interesting how,
according to several authors,13,16 the activity of the enzyme
decreases after mutating Tyr-87, a key residue in the inner
active site with favorable inﬂuence, into alanine. Nevertheless,
others state an increase in the activity.
19 Overall, the diﬃculty
of evaluating kinetic data derived from mutants of diﬀerent
groups because of the di ﬀerent experimental setups, con-

remarked.
■ CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, the breakage mechanism of the PET
polymer by the two main enzymes showing certain activity,
PETse and LCC-ICCG, has been studied. Three independent
systems have been employed: PETase/MHET
2 and PETase/
MHET3, to test whether the reactivity depends on the length
of the polymer chain, and LCC-ICCG/MHET2, to compare
the proﬁciency of both enzymes that work in diﬀerent ranges
of temperatures. A reaction pathway, involving formation of an
acyl-enzyme intermediate, acylation stage, and its subsequently
released deacylation stage, has been investigated by generating
free energy surfaces in terms of potential of the mean force
(PMFs) with QM/MM potentials. The QM sub-set of atoms
was described at the semiempirical (AM1) and DFT (M06-
2X) level of theory. Two possible dispositions of the substrate
in the active site have been explored in the case of LCC-ICCG,
ﬁnding one to be clearly favored over the other. The resulting
free energy landscape reveals that both the acylation and the
deacylation take place in a stepwise manner in all the three
models. In all cases, the rate-limiting step was found to be the
second step of the acylation process, with activation free
energies of 20.3, 18.9, and 21.1 kcal·mol
−1, respectively. These
results ﬁt in the range of the available experimental data.
Structural analysis of the evolution of the active site along the
reaction progress and the study of the electrostatic interactions
between the substrate and the protein decomposed by residues
conﬁrm the similarity in the behavior of the active site of these
two enzymes capable of degrading PET in a signi ﬁcantly
diﬀerent range of temperatures. According to our results, the
origin of the apparent better performance of LCC protein over
PETase cannot be in mechanistic diﬀerences of the chemical
step but in its capabilities of working at higher temperature and
its intrinsic relationship with the crystallinity grade of the
polymer. Our results may be useful for the development of
more eﬃcient enzymes in the biodegradation of PET, with
future applications to address the environmental problems
derived from the generalized plastic consumption and disposal.
■ COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
Preparation of the Systems. The PETase molecular
model was built upon the highest-resolved X-ray crystal
structure (0.92 Å) of the apoenzyme available in the Protein
Data Bank, with code 6EQE.
12 The LCC model was
constructed from the crystallized wild-type structure with
PDB code 4EB0
22 and mutated to produce the ICCG variant
(F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G). The proteins were prepared
with Maestro software;
32 disulﬁde bonds were built and
hydrogen atoms present already were deleted and added
corresponding to a protonation state of pH 7 with PROPKA.
33
Before the inclusion of the plastic ligand, both molecular
models were relaxed under unconstrained classical MD with
GROMACS 2018.4.
34 For this purpose, explicit solvation
consisting of 8560 and 8486 water molecules was added
together with 6 Cl
− counterions in a rhombic dodecahedron-
shaped box. The systems were then statically minimized with
the steepest descent and conjugate gradient to avoid clashes.
Random velocities were generated at 313 K, and 500 ps of
protein-constrained NVT and NPT was run as equilibration.
Finally, 50 ns of unconstrained production was carried out
under an NPT ensemble with a time step of 1 fs and using
AMBER ﬀ03
35 with TIP3P for water molecules (see Figure S1
of the Supporting Information).
Conﬁrming the equilibration of the systems based on the
RMSD of the backbone, the plastic polymer was manually
added based on the position of the HEMT molecule co-
crystalized in the PDB with code 5XH3.
13 A similar classic MD
procedure as described before was performed to equilibrate the
ligand−enzyme models during a long simulation of 200 ns
(Figure S2), granting a necessary organization of the active site
that, as previously stressed by Smithet al., is required in multi-
step enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
36 The polymers were
described with GAFF37 parameters assigned with Antecham-

QM/MM Calculations. Favorable (reactive) structures,
based on the minimization of the OGSer−CPET distance, were
chosen after the MD simulations as starting points for QM/
MM calculations with the fDYNAMO library.
40 The quantum-
treated region was conﬁrmed by the polymeric ligand, a water
molecule when necessary and key atoms of the catalytic triad
(Ser/His/Asp), as depicted inFigure 5. The rest of the protein
was described by the OPLS-AA
41 force ﬁeld and TIP3P for the
solvent.42 All atoms farther than 20 Å from the catalytic
serine’s oxygen were kept frozen.
A three-layer scheme of calculations was used to
quantitatively describe the reaction mechanism. First, the
bidimensional potential energy surface (PES) of every step was
explored using the AM1
43 semiempirical Hamiltonian to
describe the QM subset of atoms to optimize every structure
while being restrained by a harmonic umbrella potential of
3500 kJ·mol
−1·Å2. It was characterized by the localization of
structures as minima or transition states if identiﬁed as saddle
points with AM1/MM. Once completed, free energy surfaces
(FESs) in terms of the PMF associated with the selected
coordinates were generated by umbrella sampling, consisting
AM1/MM MD simulations of 10 ps of equilibration and 20 ps
of production with a time step of 1 fs. A harmonic force of
2500 kJ·mol
−1·Å2 was employed, and the weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM)44 was used to integrate the data.
With this technique, the expected associated error is usually
lower than 1 kcal·mol
−1.45 On top of that, a last layer of a high
level of theory is employed in an interpolation correction way
over the semiempirical results, a methodology successfully
tested previously in our laboratory.
46 The M06-2X functional47
with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set was used, employing
Gaussian39 software together with the fDYNAMO library.40
Selected transition states were also located, employing directly
DFT/MM (its coordinates are deposited in Table S4 of the
Supporting Information). Averaged geometries were obtained
from longer (100 ps) simulations of the structures of interest.
The interaction energy of each residue of the protein with the
ligand was computed along these trajectories.
