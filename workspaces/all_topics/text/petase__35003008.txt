Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) biodegradation is regarded as an environmentally
friendly degradation method. In this study, an artiﬁcial microbial consortium composed
of Rhodococcus jostii, Pseudomonas putida and two metabolically engineered Bacillus
subtilis was constructed to degrade PET. First, a two-species microbial consortium
was constructed with two engineered B. subtilis that could secrete PET hydrolase
(PETase) and monohydroxyethyl terephthalate hydrolase (MHETase), respectively; it
could degrade 13.6% (weight loss) of the PET ﬁlm within 7 days. A three-species
microbial consortium was further obtained by adding R. jostii to reduce the inhibition
caused by terephthalic acid (TPA), a breakdown product of PET. The weight of PET
ﬁlm was reduced by 31.2% within 3 days, achieving about 17.6% improvement
compared with the two-species microbial consortium. Finally, P . putidawas introduced
to reduce the inhibition caused by ethylene glycol (EG), another breakdown product of
PET, obtaining a four-species microbial consortium. With the four-species consortium,
the weight loss of PET ﬁlm reached 23.2% under ambient temperature. This study
constructed and evaluated the artiﬁcial microbial consortia in PET degradation, which
demonstrated the great potential of artiﬁcial microbial consortia in the utilization of
complex substrates, providing new insights for biodegradation of complex polymers.

INTRODUCTION
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was ﬁrst used to produce disposable soft bottles in the twentieth
century (Koshti et al., 2018). It has been welcomed worldwide and become an indispensable part of
people’s lives. However, due to improper treatment strategies and the strong mechanical properties
of plastic products, serious environmental problems such as soil pollution and disturbance of
marine ecosystems have occurred (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014; Y ang et al., 2021). Therefore, PET
biodegradation has attracted more and more attentions as an environmentally friendly alternative,
requiring mild temperature and low energy consumption (Zimmermann and Billig, 2011; Wei
and Zimmermann, 2017). The degradation products are easy to be recycled, which is an eﬀective
method to control plastic pollution.
Tokiwa and Suzuki (1977) proposed the idea of using enzymes to degrade polymers in 1977.
Since then, many PET-degrading enzymes have been discovered and characterized from various

Qi et al. PET Biodegradation
microorganisms (Kawai et al., 2019, 2020; Bollinger et al., 2020;
Carr et al., 2020; Mohanan et al., 2020; Ballerstedt et al., 2021;
Gambarini et al., 2021; Oda et al., 2021). Esterases (Zimmermann
and Billig, 2011), cutinases (Ronkvist et al., 2009; Kawai et al.,
2014; Sulaiman et al., 2014; Tournier et al., 2020), and lipases
(Zhang et al., 2004) have been used in the degradation of PET
(Kan et al., 2021). A series of strategies that could enhance
the catalytic and activity of PET-degrading enzymes have been
proposed (Kawai et al., 2019; Carr et al., 2020; Maurya et al., 2020;
Samak et al., 2020; Ballerstedt et al., 2021; Berselli et al., 2021; Gao
et al., 2021; Maity et al., 2021; Mohanty et al., 2021).
The mechanism of PET biodegradation is surface
hydrophilization of PET ﬁlms (Kawai et al., 2019). The
ends of polymer chains usually protrude, or some polymer
chains may form loops, and these are hydrolyzed to carboxylic
acid and hydroxyl residues (Kawai et al., 2019). Microorganisms
capable of degrading PET ﬁrst adhere onto the surface of
PET ﬁlms, and then secret PET-degrading enzymes to bind
to the substrate (Jaiswal et al., 2020). PET-degrading enzymes
mainly act on the ester bond of PET, hydrolyzing it into bis-
(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), monohydroxyethyl
terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG). BHET and MHET are both incomplete degradation
products, and BHET can be further degraded by PET-degrading
enzymes. MHET can be further degraded into TPA and EG
under the catalysis of monohydroxyethyl terephthalate hydrolase
(MHETase) (Yoshida et al., 2016).
However, most of PET-degrading enzymes like lipases,
cutinases and esterases are able to degrade PET under high
temperatures (50–70◦C), and show very low degradation activity
under ambient temperatures (Puspitasari et al., 2020). In 2016,
a bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 was isolated
from a waste recycling station (Yoshida et al., 2016). It could
secret PET hydrolase (PETase) and MHETase to degrade PET
into intermediate products at 30 ◦C, providing a basis for
biodegradation under ambient temperatures. Since then, the
structures of PETase and MHETase have been analyzed, and a
series of studies for eﬀective enzyme modiﬁcations were carried
out, obtaining remarkable results (Han et al., 2017; Austin et al.,
2018; Joo et al., 2018; Palm et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019).
At present, several chassis cells, including Escherichia coli
(Seo et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2021), Bacillus sp. (Huang et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2020), Pichia pastoris (Chen et al., 2020), and
marine microalgae (Moog et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020) have
been reported to be capable of expressing and secreting PETase.
These results established a theoretical basis for the design of
PET biodegradation systems. Most studies focused on the initial
degradation step. Hydrophobin has been used to convert PET to
a hydrophilic form so that it is easier for PETase to contact and
thus catalyze the reaction (Ribitsch et al., 2015; Puspitasari et al.,
2020). Another study examined how the proximity of the two
enzymes inﬂuences hydrolytic activity by linking the C terminus
of MHETase to the N terminus of PETase (Knott et al., 2020).
Puriﬁed fusion protein could degrade amorphous PET, and its
function was stronger than PETase alone.
PET is a high molecular polymer that cannot enter
cells. Enzymatic degradation of PET in vitro has been
extensively studied, but the puriﬁcation and preparation
process of PETase and MHETase needs additional cost and
time of enzyme puriﬁcation and preparation. PETase and
MHETase have relatively higher enzymatic activity at ambient
temperature than the other reported enzymes (Yoshida et al.,
2016; Papadopoulou et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019).
Considering that the optimal growth temperature of most
microorganisms that can produce PET-degrading enzymes is
usually 30–40 ◦C, these two enzymes provided a possibility
for the direct degradation of PET by microorganisms. In
view of the requirements of industrial application, whole
cell catalysis is more convenient and practical than enzymes
puriﬁcation. However, the complexity of the metabolic network
could increase the physiological burden of chassis cells and
restrict their growth.
Additionally, intermediate metabolites are usually toxic. PET
breakdown products TPA and EG are both toxic to cells (Gong
et al., 2011; Franden et al., 2018). Besides, TPA has been
proved to inhibit the secretion of the degrading enzyme (Gong
et al., 2011). Accumulation of intermediate metabolites often
inhibits the growth of microorganisms and aﬀects degradation
eﬃciency (Knott et al., 2020). The intermediate and ﬁnal products
of PET biodegradation have been identiﬁed as competitive
inhibitors of PET hydrolases (Vertommen et al., 2005; Barth
et al., 2015). To deal with these problems, artiﬁcial microbial
consortia can be used to mimick natural microbial consortia and
perform more complex tasks in a more complex environment
(Jones et al., 2017; Krause et al., 2017; Jones and Wang, 2018;
Qian et al., 2020). Artiﬁcial microbial consortium is artiﬁcially
designed and synthesized multi-species co-cultured microbial
system based on synthetic biology strategies (Ding et al., 2016;
Diender et al., 2021). It could achieve the biosynthesis or
biodegradation of complex products by integrating the metabolic
capabilities of physiologically diﬀerent species (Ergal et al.,
2021). A consortium consisting of three engineered P. putida .
was constructed to convert PU monomers into rhamnolipids
(Utomo et al., 2020). A novel consortium of Enterobacter and
Pseudomonas was constructed to enhance the biodegradation
of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP)
(Skariyachan et al., 2021). Besides, marine microbial consortia
have been used to degrade plasticized unpretreated polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) ﬁlms (containing a total of 30% w/w of additives)
by 11.7 ± 0.6% after 7 months (Giacomucci et al., 2020).
These results highlight the potential of microbial consortia in
plastic degradation.
To explore the great potential of artiﬁcial microbial consortia
in the utilization of complex polymers, synthetic biology
approaches were used to design and construct an artiﬁcial
microbial consortium for PET degradation, which consisted of
two engineered B. subtilis, Rhodococcus jostii (Rj, Supplementary
Table 1) and Pseudomonas putida (Pp, Supplementary Table 1).
The artiﬁcial microbial consortium was proved to eﬃciently
reduce the inhibition of breakdown products TPA and EG, and
the degradation eﬃciency of PET was improved. The strategy
of degrading PET by artiﬁcial microbial consortia provided
novel ideas for the later future degradation of more other
types of polymers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
PET ﬁlm (ES301445, amorphous, transparent, 0.25 mm
thickness) was purchased from Goodfellow GmbH (London,
United Kingdom). BHET ( > 85%) was purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry (Shanghai, China). p-Nitrophenyl acetate
(pNPA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
United States). Other chemicals ( Supplementary Table 2) used
in this study were of analytical grade and purchased from
commercial sources.
Strains, Plasmids, and Primers
B. subtilis 168 ( Bacillus Genetic Stock Center) was used as the
starting strain for transformation. E. coli Trans1-T1 (TransGene
Biotech, Beijing, China) was used for plasmid construction and
replication. Wild-type strains R. jostii RHA1 (Lindsay Eltis, Univ.
British Columbia) and P. putida KT2440 (ATCC
R⃝ 47054) were
used for three- and four-species consortia. Microbial strains used
in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Plasmid Construction and B. subtilis
Transformation
All plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table 3. The PETase used in this study was the mutant I179F
obtained from previous research (Ma et al., 2018). The PETase
gene (GenBank accession number, GAP38373.1) and the
MHETase gene (GenBank accession number, GAP38911) were
codon-optimized and obtained by GenScript Corporation
(Nanjing, China) ( Supplementary Table 4 ). All fragments
were ampliﬁed using Phanta
R⃝ Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
(Vazyme Biotech., Nanjing, China) and were gel puriﬁed using
a kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) before cloning. Fragments
of nine common signal peptides were ampliﬁed from the
B. subtilis genome ( Supplementary Table 5 ). The gene PETase
was ampliﬁed from the synthesized PETase gene (primer
pairs shown in Supplementary Table 6 ), and homologous
arms of signal peptides were introduced. The fragments of
diﬀerent signal peptides and PETase were obtained by overlap
extension PCR (OE-PCR), digested by BamHI and EcoRI,
subcloned with linearized pHP13- P43. This generated plasmids
pHP13-P43-XynA-PETase, pHP13-P43-BglS-PETase, pHP13-P43-
Csn-PETase, pHP13-P43-SacB-PETase, pHP13-P43-PelB-PETase,
pHP13-P43-AmyE-PETase, pHP13- P43-BglC-PETase, pHP13-
P43-YvpA-PETase and pHP13- P43-LipB-PETase. Similarly, the
fragments of LipB and MHETase were obtained by OE-PCR,
generating plasmid pHP13- P43-LipB-MHETase. Recombinant
plasmids were transformed into B. subtilis 168 , yielding
nine strains capable of secreting PETase and one strain that
could secrete MHETase. The strains containing recombinant
plasmid pHP13- P43-LipB-PETase and pHP13- P43-LipB-
MHETase were named BS_PETase and BS_MHETase (B1 and
B2, Supplementary Table 1 ). B. subtilis transformation was
performed using the two-step method of nutrient degradation
(Spizizen, 1958).
Pretreatment and Culture Condition
Pretreatment of Substrate
BHET was dissolved with 50% γ-cyclodextrin solution, and then
ﬁltered and sterilized. The degradation reaction of BHET was
detected with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
PET ﬁlm was ﬁrst cut into 1.0 cm ×1.5 cm sheets and was
weighed. Sheets were washed for 1 h each with 1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 70% ethanol, then distilled water. PET ﬁlm
was irradiated with UV light for 24 h and added to the medium
as a substrate. When degradation reaction was terminated, PET
ﬁlms were removed from the reaction solution, washed with
70% ethanol, dried at 70 ◦C for 30 min, then analyzed with the
gravimetric weight loss method.
Culture Condition
For initial growth, all bacteria were cultured in 5 mL Luria-
Bertani broth (LB) for 12 h with shaking at 220 rpm. B. subtilis
and P. putida were grown at 37◦C and R. jostii was grown at 30◦C.
LB for B. subtilis additionally contained 2 µg/mL erythromycin.
For PET degradation experiments by PETase, 10µg of puriﬁed
PETase (Ma et al., 2018) was incubated with PET ﬁlm at 30 ◦C
for 48 h. The amount of adding exogenous PET monomers
was 0.3 mM TPA, 0.6 mM EG, and a mixture of 0.3 mM
TPA +0.6 mM EG.
For PET degradation experiments by the two- or three-species
microbial consortium, the initial volume of LB medium was
20 mL. During the 7 days of the degradation process, 10 mL
of fresh LB medium was supplemented on the 2nd, 3rd, and
4th days. For PET degradation experiments by the four-species
microbial consortium, BS_PETase, BS_MHETase, R. jostii and
P. putida were cultured overnight in 50 mL of LB medium.
Cells were obtained by centrifuging 5 mL of culture medium at
4,000 rpm for 5 min. The bacteria were washed with fresh W n
medium ( Supplementary Table 2 ) and diluted to OD 600 = 2.
P. putida was diluted 1, 10, 102, 103, 105, 106 times, then 100 µL
was added to microbial consortia. Bacteria strains, BS_PETase,
BS_MHETase and R. jostii were added without dilution (0.3,
0.1, and 1.0 mL, respectively). The ﬁnal ratio of BS_PETase,
BS_MHETase, R. jostii and P. putida was 3:1:10:10 −5, which
can be changed by changing the inoculation volume. The
consortium was inoculated into 20 mL W n medium with 2
µg/mL erythromycin, and 10 mL Wn medium was supplemented
on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days of degradation. Each experiment
was repeated in triplicate.
Terephthalic Acid, Bis-(2-Hydroxyethyl)
Terephthalate, and Ethylene Glycol Quantiﬁcation
After cultivation of consortia with BHET or PET ﬁlm, samples
and standard solutions were puriﬁed with a ﬁlter membrane to
detect the content with high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). TPA and BHET were analyzed by using HPLC with
a UV detector (Waters, Milford, MA, United States) equipped
with a Hypersil OD-2 C18 column (4.6 mm ×250 mm, 5 µm,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States). The
mobile phase comprised 40% methanol and 60% formic acid
(0.1%, v/v) solution (10 µL injection, 0.6 mL/min, 30 ◦C). The
maximum absorption wavelength was 240 nm.

Qi et al. PET Biodegradation
EG was analyzed by HPLC with a refractive index
detector (Waters) equipped with an HPX-87H column
(7.8 mm ×300 mm; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States).
Sulfuric acid (5 mM) was employed as the mobile phase (10 µL
injection, 0.5 mL/min, 60◦C).
Screening of Signal Peptide for PET Hydrolase
Secretion
The engineered B. subtilis with diﬀerent signal peptides
(Supplementary Table 5 ) were grown in 50 mL of LB with 2
µg/mL erythromycin at 37◦C with 220 rpm shaking for 24 h. The
culture was diluted in 50 mL of fresh LB medium to an initial
OD600 of 0.2 for shake ﬂask fermentation for 12 h. The activity
of PETase was determined using pNPA as substrate. The pNPA
was ﬁrst dissolved in methanol and then diluted with phosphate
buﬀer (50 mM Na2HPO4-HCl, pH 7.0) to a ﬁnal concentration of
1 mM. The reaction was triggered by adding 200 µL of substrate
solution to the 50 mL of medium. The mixture was incubated
at 37◦C for 5 min, and the product, p-Nitrophenyl (pNP), was
continuously measured at a wavelength of 405 nm.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
The PET ﬁlms were washed as the method in section
“Pretreatment of Substrate, ” and then observed with a
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The relevant places
in the samples were scanned using an electron microscope at
50,000 ×magniﬁcation.
RESULTS
Construction of a Two-Species Microbial
Consortium to Degrade Polyethylene
Terephthalate
Considering PET is a polymer which is diﬃcult to enter cells,
the biodegradation of PET requires microorganisms that can
eﬃciently secrete PET-degrading enzymes. The biodegradation
of PET at ambient temperatures includes a two-step reaction:
PET is degraded into MHET catalyzed by PETase, and
MHET is degraded into TPA and EG catalyzed by MHETase.
An engineered B. subtilis that can eﬃciently secrete PETase
(Bs_PETase, Supplementary Table 1) was ﬁrst constructed. The
screening of a better signal peptide for PETase expression in
B. subtilis could be carried out, and nine commonly used signal
peptides ( Supplementary Table 5 ) were tested. Results showed
great diﬀerences in secretion of the target protein using the
diﬀerent signal peptides. Signal peptide LipB from extracellular
esterase had the best performance, producing 2.98 mM of pNP
(Figure 1A). The SEM image of PET ﬁlm surface cultured with
Bs_PETase showed obvious structural changes compared with
the control group ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Then, another
engineered B. subtilis was constructed to eﬃciently secrete
MHETase (Bs_MHETase, Supplementary Table 1).
BHET was used as the substrate to explore optimal PET
degradation. The time required for complete degradation of
BHET increased as the concentration of BHET increased. The
ﬁnal BHET concentration used was 2 g/L because it was
diﬃcult to completely dissolve in γ-cyclodextrin solution at
higher concentrations ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). As shown in
the degradation curve of BHET and the generation curve of
TPA, PETase showed eﬃcient degradation activity for BHET
whereas MHETase did not ( Figure 1B ). Besides, previous
studies additionally showed that PETase has a small amount
of activity on MHET, generating TPA and EG (Yoshida et al.,
2016). Thus, a two-species microbial consortium composed
of two engineered B. subtilis (Bs_PETase and Bs_MHETase,
Supplementary Table 1 ) was designed for degradation of
BHET (Figure 2A).
The artiﬁcial microbial consortia are designed for the complex
metabolic network to achieve the optimal process allocation
and reduce the cell pressure (Kong et al., 2018). Compared
with Bs_PETase alone, the degradation eﬃciency of two-species
microbial consortium was signiﬁcantly improved—2 g/L BHET
could be completely degraded within 24 h (Figure 3A). However,
wild-type B. subtilis also had weak degradation ability, which
may be related to its complex metabolic network in vivo
(Jones and Wang, 2018).
Temperature, pH, and inoculation rate were optimized.
Results showed that the changes of temperatures and pH
would not aﬀect the degradation rates of PET dramatically
(Supplementary Figures 3A,B ). Although the optimal growth
temperature for B. subtilis was 37◦C, the optimal temperature for
the two-species microbial consortium was 38◦C (Supplementary
Figure 3A ). Diﬀerent inoculation ratios greatly aﬀected
degradation rate ( Figure 3B ). The optimal ratio of Bs_PETase
and Bs_MHETase at inoculation was 3:1. After optimization,
2 g/L of BHET could be completely degraded within 22 h
(Figure 3B), which was signiﬁcantly improved compared to that
before (24 h, Figure 3A ). It is likely that increasing the initial
amount of Bs_PETase increased the amount of PETase, thus
improving the degradation eﬀect.
Effect of Terephthalic Acid and Ethylene
Glycol on Degradation Process
A series of optimizations on the two-species microbial
consortium was carried out to obtain an appropriate degradation
condition. The two-species microbial consortium was used
to degrade amorphous PET ﬁlm. Results showed that the
addition of fresh medium could maintain the growth of bacteria
(Figure 3C). However, the production of TPA increased rapidly
in the ﬁrst 3 days, then slowed down, and basically reached
equilibrium after the ﬁfth day ( Figure 3C ). It is hypothesized
that a byproduct of the reaction may have slowed the process
over time. Exogenous addition of EG, TPA and their mixture
markedly aﬀected the degradation rates of PET ( Figure 3D ).
The weight of PET ﬁlm in the group with no PET monomers
added decreased by 4.76 ±0.38 mg (mean ±standard deviation)
but only by 1.53 ±0.22 mg in the group with TPA added
(Figure 3D ). Although TPA had the highest inhibitory eﬀect
on the degradation process, an inhibitory eﬀect of EG was also
observed. TPA, EG and the TPA/EG combination also inhibited
degradation of BHET (Figure 3E).

FIGURE 1 | Construction of a two-species microbial consortium for BHET degradation. (A) Fusion of the PETase gene to different signal peptides resulted in different
levels of PETase secretion, and therefore different levels of the product pNP . The species in the control group were wild-typeB. subtilis. (B) Comparison of the effects
of PETase and MHETase on BHET. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 (one-sided
t-test).
In order to further explore the inﬂuence why this inhibition
occurred, the eﬀect of TPA and EG on bacterial consortium
growth was measured. The growth rate of bacteria was severely
inhibited in the presence of TPA, whereas the addition of EG
had little eﬀect on it ( Figure 3F). Therefore, it is speculated that
the addition of TPA to the two-species microbial consortium
during PET degradation negatively aﬀected bacterial growth, in
turn decreasing enzyme production.
Construction of a Three-Species
Microbial Consortium for Polyethylene
Terephthalate Degradation
In order to eliminate the inhibitory eﬀect, further degradation
of TPA is needed. R. jostii RHA1, which was isolated from
soil, has extraordinary abilities to degrade a variety of aromatic
compounds (Hara et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2012). R. jostii RHA1
was veriﬁed to degrade TPA eﬃciently, with 2 g/L TPA being
completely degraded within 28 h (Figure 4A).
A three-species microbial consortium consisting of
BS_PETase, BS_MHETase and R. jostii was constructed for
BHET and PET degradation to reduce the inhibition of TPA on
PETase ( Figure 2B ). Temperature, pH, and inoculation ratio
were optimized. Results showed that diﬀerent temperatures and
pH had almost no eﬀect on degradation rates ( Supplementary
Figures 3C,D ), while the initial concentration of R. jostii
compared to the other two species aﬀected the degradation
rates dramatically ( Figure 4B ). The optimal inoculation ratio
of Bs_PETase: Bs_MHETase: R. jostii was 3:1:10 ( Figure 4B ).
When the three-species microbial consortium was applied to
degradation of BHET, there was a relatively low concentration
of TPA compared to the two-species microbial consortium,
and the inhibitory eﬀect of TPA on PETase was weak; 2 g/L of
BHET could be completely degraded within 20 h ( Figure 4C ).
Degradation of PET was also improved with the three-species
microbial consortium compared to the two-species microbial
consortium. After 7 days, 31.2 ±2.2% of PET was degraded by
the three-species microbial consortium ( Figure 4D), compared
to 13.6 ±1.1% with the two-species microbial consortium,
achieving an improvement of about 17.6% due to the reduction
of inhibitory TPA.
Construction of a Four-Species Microbial
Consortium for Polyethylene
Terephthalate Degradation
Like TPA, EG is also a toxic compound with a signiﬁcant
inhibitory eﬀect on the degradation process of PET ( Figure 3D),
and therefore further degradation strategy for truly safe, green
disposal of PET is needed (Devillers et al., 2002). EG can be
metabolized into acetaldehyde by P. putida KT2440 (Mueckschel
et al., 2012; Franden et al., 2018; Li W.-J. et al., 2019). After
preliminarily verifying the ability of P. putida KT2440 to
completely degrade 2 g/L of EG within 20 h ( Supplementary
Figure 4A ), it was introduced into the three-species microbial
consortium to generate a four-species consortium. In this
consortium, Bs_PETase secreted PETase to degrade PET into
MHET; Bs_MHETase secreted MHETase to degrade MHET into
TPA and EG, which were then degraded byR. jostii and P. putida,
respectively ( Figure 2C ). This consortium therefore eﬀectively
both reduced the inhibition eﬀect of TPA and EG and avoided
further environmental pollution.
In co-cultivation, P. putida strongly inhibited growth of
the other three bacteria in nutrient-rich media such as LB,
Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose Medium (YPD), and Synthetic
Complete Medium (SC) ( Supplementary Table 2 ); when all
four species were cultured in these media for 24 h then the
culture was spread on solid growth medium, only P. putida
was found. It was therefore necessary to identify a suitable
medium to prevent the rapid growth of P. putida compared to
the other species. Inorganic salt media (Supplementary Table 2)
have relatively poor nutrition and were chosen for comparison.
Among them, W medium had the strongest inhibitory eﬀect
on the growth of P. putida , allowing it to grow to an OD 600

FIGURE 2 | Schematic diagram of PET degradation by synthetic microbial consortia. (A) Bs_PETase (B1) and Bs_MHETase (B2) were engineered to secrete PETase
and MHETase to degrade PET and a two-species microbial consortium was constructed. (B) Due to PETase inhibition by TPA,R. jostii (Rj) was added, resulting in a

of only 2.4 over 24 h. In contrast, R. jostii reached an OD 600
of only 4.6 after 24 h, becoming the dominant strain, and
B. subtilis reached an OD 600 of 0.8, nearly 4 times higher than
that in the other media tested ( Supplementary Figure 4B). The
growth of B. subtilis was signiﬁcantly improved with sucrose and
glucose as dual carbon sources, and the addition of ammonium
sulfate and potassium nitrate ( Supplementary Figures 4C,D ).
BHET (2 g/L) was completely degraded within 20 h by the four-
species microbial consortium, TPA and EG were not accumulated
(Supplementary Figure 4E).
The capacity of single bacterial species with the microbial
consortia to degrade PET was compared. Wild-type B. subtilis,
R. jostii, and P. putida could not degrade PET ( Figure 5A). The
weight of the PET ﬁlm decreased by 1.25±0.14 mg after 7 days in
the two-species microbial consortium, but by 2.80 ±0.18 mg in
the four-species consortium, doubling the degradation rate of the
two-species consortium (Figure 5A). The four-species microbial
consortium also successfully relieved the inhibitory eﬀect of TPA.
However, the concentration of TPA in the four-species microbial
consortium increased on the 3rd day ( Figure 5B). This may be
because R. jostii preferentially used glucose in the early stage
before metabolizing TPA.
The temperature, pH, and inoculation ratio of the four-species
microbial consortium were further optimized. The most suitable
temperature was 37 ◦C ( Supplementary Figure 5A ), the pH
had no obvious inﬂuence ( Supplementary Figure 5B ), and the

optimal inoculation ratio of Bs_PETase: Bs_MHETase: R. jostii:
P. putida was 3:1:10: 10−5 (Figures 5C,D). With these optimized
parameters, the four-species microbial consortium reduced the
weight of PET ﬁlm by 7.9 ±0.78 mg within 7 days ( Figure 5D),
a degradation rate of 23.2 ±2.3%. Although the four-species
microbial consortium could degrade EG, PET was not degraded
as eﬃciently as it was by the three-species microbial consortium
(31.2 ±2.2%) because of the nutrient-poor medium. Both the
three-species and four-species microbial consortia relieved the
inhibitory eﬀect of TPA. In terms of degradation eﬃciency, the
three-species microbial consortium is superior, but the four-
species microbial consortium is more environmentally friendly
in terms of fully degrading the toxic products (TPA and EG)
formed by breakdown of PET. It is therefore necessary to further
optimize the relationship between the four bacteria to improve
degradation eﬃciency.
DISCUSSION
Enzymatic degradation is currently considered an ideal method
for PET degradation, and shows promise for large-scale PET
waste degradation. Previous studies engineered and compared
diﬀerent signal peptides to enhance extracellular production of
PETase in E. coli (Cui et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021) and B. subtilis
(Huang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020). These studies emphasized
the importance of signal peptides in the secretion of heterologous
protein. LipB from extracellular esterase was selected as the
best signal peptide to secret PET-degrading enzymes, and two
engineered B. subtilis strains that could secrete PETase and
MHETase were generated. Most studies focused on the enzymatic
degradation of PET in vitro , which needed to separate and
purify the enzymes. Compared with degrading PET by puriﬁed
enzymes, the degradation of PET by engineered B. subtilis in

the fermentation system was studied, which is hopeful to realize
large-scale industrial application.
In recent years, artiﬁcial microbial consortia that simulate
natural microbial consortia to complete complex biological
processes have become an important research direction of
synthetic biology (Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
Artiﬁcial microbial consortia introduced modularity to microbial
metabolite by assigning diﬀerent parts of the metabolic pathways
to each member of the consortium (Zhou et al., 2015). The
modular principle of artiﬁcial microbial consortia can distribute
the complicated work to diﬀerent microorganisms according to
their own speciﬁc advantages, so as to complete the work that
cannot be completed by a single microorganism. Only using a
single microorganism to degrade PET and utilize the degradation
products will increase the metabolic burden, making it diﬃcult to
achieve eﬀective degradation. Constructing microbial consortia
can reduce metabolic burden and promote biodegradation.
A microbial consortium including three engineered E. coli
was constructed to reduced metabolic burden to synthesize
rosmarinic acid (Li Z. et al., 2019). Another consortium
was constructed to produce short-chain fatty acids from
lignocellulose, and it can reduce metabolic burden and perform
multiple tasks (Shahab et al., 2020). These studies showed the
potential to reduce metabolic burden by artiﬁcial consortia.
A four-species microbial consortium consisting of Bs_PETase,
Bs_MHETase, R. jostii, and P. putida was constructed to degrade
PET. In this consortium, B. subtilis has the advantages of high
secretion capacity, fast growth and lacking of an outer membrane,
and it is regarded as a great chassis to secret heterologous proteins
(Westers et al., 2004; van Dijl and Hecker, 2013). B. subtilis

Qi et al. PET Biodegradation
was chose as the model chassis and engineered it to secret
PETase and MHETase, respectively. The two-species microbial
consortium was considered as a PET-degrading module. Wild
R. jostii and P. putida were reported to eﬀectively use TPA
and EG to support their growth, respectively (Choi et al.,
2005; Wehrmann et al., 2017). The metabolic pathways of
TPA and EG were considered as the TPA-degrading module
and EG-degrading module. By combining the three modules
to construct a four-species microbial consortium, PET can be
degraded into monomers that could be absorbed and utilized
by microorganisms capable of metabolizing them into carbon
dioxide and water through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Figure 2).
Artiﬁcial microbial consortia can relieve the inhibition of
degradation products and improve the degradation rates. It has
been demonstrated by a microbial consortium for corn ﬁber
conversion to reduce the inhibition of hemicellulose hydrolysis
products ethanol (Beri et al., 2020). It was previously shown
that accumulation of MHET inhibited the function of PETase
(Knott et al., 2020), likely explaining the increased degradation
eﬃciency of the two-species consortium that was constructed
(Figure 3A ). Besides, the PET monomer TPA inhibited the
degradation process. Therefore, R. jostii was added to the existing
consortium to break down TPA, leading to a three-species
microbial consortium with improved degradation eﬃciency. This
three-species consortium could degrade more than 30% of PET
within 7 days. By combining the PET-degrading module and
the TPA-degrading module to construct a three-species microbial
consortium, the inhibitory eﬀect of TPA can be relieved, and the
degradation eﬃciency can be improved ( Figure 2).
Compared with pure culture, artiﬁcial microbial consortia
have the advantages in stability and eﬃciency. The eﬀects of
environmental factors on the stability of the consortia were
compared ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). Results showed that the
changes of temperatures and pH would not aﬀect the stability of
the two- and three-species microbial consortia ( Supplementary
Figure 3). These results showed the stability of the consortia that
was constructed.
Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 could completely degrade low
crystallinity PET ﬁlm after 6 weeks at 30 ◦C (Yoshida et al.,
2016). However, I. sakaiensis 201-F6 is diﬃcult to be genetically
engineered due to its complex genetic background. This study
constructed engineered B. subtilis to degrade PET, and the
degradation products are completely converted into carbon
dioxide and water. As far as degrading PET by using artiﬁcial
microbial consortia, there are few studies on it. An artiﬁcial three-
microbial consortium including Exiguobacterium sp., Halomonas
sp., and Ochrobactrum sp. in a 1:1:1 ration was reported to
degrade PET ﬁlms, and PET ﬁlms were fully degraded into small
pieces after 2 weeks (Gao and Sun, 2021). In comparison with
it, this study represents the ﬁrst successful eﬀort to degrade PET
without any degradation products with an artiﬁcial microbial
consortium, opening up new avenues for biodegradation of PET.
The consortium described here not only degraded PET under
ambient temperatures, but also addressed PETase inhibition
by PET degradation products and improved the degradation
eﬃciency. It reveals the potential of artiﬁcial microbial consortia
in biodegradation of PET or other complex polymers. In
the future, developing enhanced microorganism chassis and
constructing artiﬁcial microbial consortia to degrade and convert
PET to high-value chemicals is a promising method to realize the
circular economy of PET waste.
CONCLUSION
In this study, three artiﬁcial microbial consortia were constructed
to degrade PET. Two B. subtilis was engineered to secrete PETase
and MHETase, respectively. Wild R. jostii and P. putida were
introduced to the microbial consortia to utilize PET monomers
TPA and EG, respectively. A four-species microbial consortium
including Bs_PETase, Bs_MHETase, R. jostii , and P. putida
was constructed to directly degraded PET into monomers, and
further converted them into carbon dioxide and water through
the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The artiﬁcial microbial consortium
successfully relieved the metabolic inhibition of TPA and EG, and
eﬀectively improved the degradation rate. The study provided
novel ideas for the future biodegradation of PET or more other
types of polymers by artiﬁcial microbial consortia.
