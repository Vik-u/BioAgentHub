The successful enzymatic degradation of polyester substrate s has fueled
worldwide investigation into the treatment of plastic waste usi ng bio-based
processes. Within this realm, marine-associated microorgani sms have emerged
as a promising source of polyester-degrading enzymes. In this work, we describe
the hydrolysis of the synthetic polymer PET by SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest, a polyesterase which was
previously identiﬁed from Streptomyces sp. SM/one.tnum/four.tnum, an isolate of the marine sponge
Haliclona simulans. The PET hydrolase activity of puriﬁed SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest was assessed
using a suspension-based assay and subsequent analysis of react ion products
by UV-spectrophotometry and RP-HPLC. SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest displayed a preference for
high salt conditions, with activity signiﬁcantly increasing at so dium chloride
concentrations from /one.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum mM up to /one.tnum,/zero.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum mM. The initial rate of PET hydrolysis by
SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest was determined to be /zero.tnum./zero.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum s−/one.tnumat /four.tnum/five.tnum◦C, which was increased by /five.tnum-fold
to /zero.tnum./zero.tnum/two.tnum s−/one.tnumupon addition of /five.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum mM sodium chloride. Sequence alignment and
structural comparison with known PET hydrolases, including the m arine halophile
PET/six.tnum, and the highly eﬃcient, thermophilic PHL/seven.tnum, revealed conserved features of
interest. Based on this work, SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest emerges as a useful enzymethat is more
similar to key players in the area of PET hydrolysis, like PHL /seven.tnum and IsPETase, than
it is to its marine counterparts. Salt-tolerant polyesterases such as SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest are
potentially valuable in the biological degradation of plast ic particles that readily
contaminate marine ecosystems and industrial wastewaters.

/one.tnum. Introduction
The Streptomyces genus has proven to be a worthwhile source of secondary metabolites,
ranging from antimicrobial to cytotoxic compounds, with human health needs being the
primary driver of the discovery eﬀorts for these bioactive products (
Lacey and Rutledge,
2022). As with other actinomycetes, Streptomyces species are also important producers of
industrially relevant enzymes ( Kumar et al., 2020 ), although perhaps they have not yet
been as well-explored in this regard to date. The last decade has seen a notable shift away

Carr et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fmicb./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum
from terrestrial ecosystems toward the marine environment as
a source of microorganisms harboring novel biological activities
(
Dharmaraj, 2010; Yang et al., 2020 ; Olaniyan and Adetunji, 2021 ).
Nevertheless, given the vast and varied nature of the Earth’s
oceans, we are still in the early stages of the quest to describe
the full potential of the marine microbiome (
Abreu et al., 2022 ).
In particular, marine invertebrates such as sponges have been
shown to represent a hotspot of microbial biodiversity and activity,
brought about by the mutualistic interactions that exist between
microbial symbionts and the host sponge, which have the potential
to be sustainably exploited for biotechnological purposes (
Amelia
et al., 2022 ).
Marine sponges harbor diverse communities of bacteria,
archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes, which inhabit sponge tissues
at densities of over 10 9 cells/cm3 and contribute to as much as
35% of the total sponge biomass (
Hentschel et al., 2012 ). Sponge-
associated microbes are known to be quite proliﬁc producers
of natural products, as well as extracellular enzymes, which are
believed to contribute positively to the metabolism and overall
health of their sea sponge host (
Taylor et al., 2007 ; de Oliveira
et al., 2020 ; Nnaji et al., 2022 ). Such enzymes are often hydrolase
family members and are likely to be produced in an attempt
to degrade the wide variety of substrates present in the large
quantities of seawater being ﬁltered by the sponge, providing
both symbiotic partners with a source of energy and nutrients
(
Wang, 2006 ; Pita et al., 2018 ; Birolli et al., 2019 ). In the marine
environment, heterotrophic microbes are responsible for the
biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic carbon, an abundant
reservoir comprising thousands of distinct chemical structures.
However, dissolved organic carbon compounds are often quite
complex and recalcitrant to degradation, thus requiring adaptable
enzymes for their utilization as substrates (
Wagner et al., 2020 ).
Marine microbial hydrolases must also withstand the changeable
and challenging conditions associated with ocean waters, further
supporting the potential applicability of these resilient enzymes
across a range of new biotech products and services (
Sana, 2015).
PET hydrolase enzymes have, for the past number of years, been
the focus of extensive research and engineering eﬀorts to support
the biological recycling of polyester plastics, with increasing
success since the identiﬁcation of TfH, a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme
from Thermobiﬁda fusca , in 2005 (
Wei et al., 2022 ). LC-cutinase
(LCC) from a leaf compost-derived metagenome has represented
a highly active benchmark PET hydrolase (
Andler et al., 2022 ;
Wei et al., 2022 ). The LCC variant, ICCG, which can achieve
90% degradation of pre-treated post-consumer PET within 10 h,
has even been implemented as a catalyst in pilot-scale PET
bio-recycling (
Tournier et al., 2020 ). Most recently, HotPETase
and FAST-PETase, which are thermostable variants of IsPETase
from the mesophilic bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis , have been
engineered to match the activities of LCC and ICCG (
Bell
et al., 2022 ; Lu et al., 2022 ). During enzymatic hydrolysis, the
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer is primarily converted
into the intermediate products MHET [mono(2-hydroxyethyl
terepththalate)] and [bis(2-hydroxyethyl terepthalate)], which may
then be further degraded into the monomeric subunits terephthalic
acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG;
Figure 1). TPA and EG can also
be further abbreviated to T and E, respectively, which allows for
short-hand notation of the PET breakdown products that reﬂects
their composition and length, for example, where ET is MHET and
ETE is BHET (
Schubert et al., 2023 ).
Within the realm of enzymatic plastic degradation, several
groups have investigated marine-derived microbes for polyester
hydrolases, particularly those capable of breaking the ester bonds
that link the subunits of the synthetic polyester PET (
Blázquez-
Sánchez et al., 2022 ; Meyer Cifuentes et al., 2022 ; Weigert et al.,
2022). PET waste is widely distributed in the marine environment,
both in macro and microplastic forms, thereby posing a signiﬁcant
threat to marine life and ultimately to humans (
Nabi et al., 2022 ).
While it is interesting to consider the enzymatic degradation of
PET by marine microorganisms, both from an ecological and
biotechnological perspective, it is not yet well-understood whether
this capacity has evolved speciﬁcally in response to plastic pollution
in our oceans or if this is among the many unconventional side
reactions that hydrolases can facilitate when deprived of simpler
substrates that are more easily metabolized (
Barzkar et al., 2021 ;
Dittmar et al., 2021 ; Jiménez et al., 2022 ).
Our group had previously identiﬁed SM14est, a polyesterase
from the marine-sponge derived Streptomyces sp. SM14, during the
mining of 52 Streptomyces genome sequences for PET hydrolase-
encoding genes. Polycaprolactone (PCL) was used to conﬁrm
polyesterase activity of the heterologously expressed enzyme
in an agar-based plate clearing assay (
Almeida et al., 2019b ).
Although petroleum-based PCL and PET are both employed
to produce semi-crystalline thermoplastics, the biodegradable
polycaprolactone only serves as a model substrate for the
more complex PET, which is an aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester
(
Niaounakis, 2017 ; Molitor et al., 2020 ). Based on computational
characterization and molecular docking with BHET, the ester of
PET monomeric units EG and TPA, hydrolytic activity toward PET
was predicted but not conﬁrmed (
Almeida et al., 2019b ).
Here we present biochemical and kinetic data for SM14est,
obtained using a suspension-based assay that allows for the
detection of PET hydrolysis products. A Bacillus subtilis
heterologous host was employed to produce and secrete
recombinant SM14est, which was his-tagged and subsequently
aﬃnity puriﬁed. The puriﬁed SM14est was found to hydrolyze
PET following incubation at 45 ◦C in sodium phosphate buﬀer
(pH 8), with products measured by UV-spectrophotometry. This
activity toward PET was enhanced with increasing concentrations
of sodium chloride (100–1,000 mM) and further progress curve
analysis revealed a 5-fold increase in the initial rate of PET
hydrolysis when sodium chloride (500 mM) was included in
the reaction.

/two.tnum./one.tnum. Enzyme expression and puriﬁcation
SM14est (Genbank: DAC80635.1) was codon optimized for
heterologous expression in Bacillus subtilis and produced as
previously described ( Jensen et al., 2010 ), with modiﬁcation during
construct design such that the native SM14est signal peptide was
replaced by AmyL (FJ556804.1) from B. licheniformis and a hexa
histidine-tag was incorporated at the C-terminus of the protein.
The recombinant SM14est protein (29 kDa) was puriﬁed by

dialysis
membrane (MWCO 12–14 kDa). The molar extinction coeﬃcient
of 39,880 M −1 cm−1 was predicted by ExPASy-ProtParam and
was used to calculate the concentration of puriﬁed enzyme from
the absorbance measured at 280 nm. The SM14est sample was
visualized following SDS-PAGE of 2.5 µ g of puriﬁed protein
on a Tris-Glycine 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Thermal
denaturation experiments were conducted in triplicate with 10 µ M
of enzyme and analyzed by nano diﬀerential scanning ﬂuorimetry
(nanoDFS) using a temperature slope of 2 ◦C min −1 (Prometheus
NT.48, Nano Temper).
/two.tnum./two.tnum. Suspension-based PET activity assay
A suspension-based assay (
Bååth et al., 2020 ) was used
to investigate the hydrolytic activity of SM14est toward semi-
crystalline PET powder reported to have >40% crystallinity
with a particle size of <300 µ M (Goodfellow Co, product
number ES306031/1). Depending on the required assay setup, this
microPET powder was suspended either in the selected buﬀer or
Milli-Q water and pipetted while under vigorous stirring. The PET
substrate suspension was transferred to low-binding microplates
(Greiner Bio-One TM 655901) or microtubes (Sarstedt 72.706.600),
followed by additional buﬀer, and ﬁnally the puriﬁed enzyme.
The reactions were performed in triplicate, with samples
incubated in a thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 1,100 rpm. Based on
preliminary results, assays were typically carried out at 45 ◦C using
0.5 µ M enzyme, 10 g L −1 PET, and 50 mM sodium phosphate
buﬀer pH 8 in a ﬁnal reaction volume of 250 µ L. Samples
were centrifuged to quench the reaction, then supernatants (100
µ L) were transferred into a UV-transparent microplate (Corning)
to measure soluble aromatic products of PET hydrolysis, such
as TPA, MHET, and BHET, at absorbance 240 nm in a plate
reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax Paradigm). As previously
described, products were quantiﬁed from the absorbance readings
by comparing with standard curves for BHET and converting
to BHET equivalents ( µ M), providing a platform for screening
and initial characterization of potential PET hydrolase enzymes

(Bååth et al., 2020 ). It should be noted that it is not possible
to diﬀerentiate between the individual soluble products using
this method, however, BHET has been previously employed as
a standard to reﬂect the pooled absorbance of soluble products
(
Thomsen et al., 2022 ).
/two.tnum./three.tnum. Progress curve analyses
Supernatant time-point samples were taken at t = 1, 3, 5,
and 7 h post-incubation for measurement at 240 nm (as previously
described). An additional 100 µ L was retained from the remaining
supernatant, treated with hydrochloric acid (2 µ L, 5M) to quench
the reaction, and stored at −20◦C until further quantiﬁcation
using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC; Thermo Scientiﬁc TM, Vanquisher: Capital HPLC).
Formic acid (7.5 mM) and acetonitrile (5% v/v) were used during
the injection of samples (20 µ L) at a ratio of 1:5 for 7.5 min,
prior to elution using acetonitrile for 12.5 min, with a ﬂow
rate of 1 mL min −1 maintained at 40 ◦C. The analytes were
detected by UV-spectrophotometry at 240 nm and Chromeleon
chromatography studio software (version 7.3.1) was used to
perform peak analysis. The mono-aromatic products of PET
hydrolysis were quantiﬁed against standards of TPA, MHET, BHET,
while longer di- and tri-aromatic compounds were quantiﬁed
against standards of TETE and TETET. All reactions were
performed in duplicate and substrate blanks were included for the
quantiﬁcation of autohydrolysis.
/two.tnum./four.tnum. Computational protein analyses
Protein sequences were aligned using T-COFFEE (
Di Tommaso
et al., 2011 ) in Expresso (structural alignment) mode, and outputs
were visualized with ESPript 3.0 ( Gouet et al., 1999 ). Alpha-Fold,
which combines a deep learning-based algorithm with well-curated
experimental knowledge from pre-existing structure and sequence
databases, was used to model the SM14est protein as it is considered
to be highly accurate with respect to atomic structure (
Jumper et al.,
2021). The Alpha-Fold-predicted structure for SM14est was veriﬁed
as a good quality model based on the per-residue conﬁdence
scores (pLDDT) and the Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) plots
(
Supplementary Figure 1 ). The SM14est model was visualized in
UCSF-Chimera and the MatchMaker tool was used to facilitate
structural comparison with other PET hydrolases (
Pettersen et al.,
2004).
/three.tnum. Results
/three.tnum./one.tnum. Puriﬁcation of SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest and Tm analysis
The expression and puriﬁcation of SM14est was evaluated
by SDS-PAGE analysis, which displayed a single band at around
29 kDa that corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of
the recombinant SM14est protein (
Figure 2A). Nano diﬀerential
scanning ﬂuorimetry was employed to study protein denaturation
and the thermal transition midpoint (T m) of SM14est was
subsequently determined to be 55 ◦C in sodium phosphate buﬀer,
pH 8 (
Figure 2B). Here, the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of aromatic
amino acid residues, primarily tryptophan, was used to track
protein unfolding by measuring and recording changes in the
ﬂuorescence intensity ratio (350:330 nm), yielding a value for T m
when plotted as a function of temperature (
Wen et al., 2020 ). The
inﬂection point and isolated peak observed following the nanoDFS
scan further validated the purity of the SM14est protein sample,
given that a mixed sample would have generated a linear F350/330
signal and multiple ﬁrst derivative peaks.
/three.tnum./two.tnum. Investigating the eﬀect of temperature,
salt, and pH on SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest PET-hydrolyzing
activity
The PET-hydrolyzing activity of the recombinant SM14est was
assessed in the temperature range 10–45 ◦C (
Figure 3A), as well as
in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl ( Figure 3B),
and in the alkaline pH range 8.5–10.5 ( Figure 3C). SM14est was
shown to hydrolyze PET, to varying extents, at a number of
diﬀerent temperatures; 10, 28, 37, and 45 ◦C (
Figure 3A). SM14est
activity increased with the addition of NaCl, using concentrations
up to 900 mM, at which point the eﬀect appeared to plateau
(
Figure 3B). A marked decrease in the PET-hydrolyzing activity of
SM14est was observed at pH 9.5 when compared to that measured
at pH 8.5 and the enzyme performed poorly when tested at
pH 10.5 (
Figure 3C).
/three.tnum./three.tnum. Characterization of SM/one.tnum/four.tnumest activity
toward PET
Given that SM14est polyesterase activity increased at higher
sodium chloride concentrations, the recombinant enzyme (0.5 µ M)
was subsequently assayed with PET (10 g L −1) as substrate over
a 7 h period at pH 8 and 45 ◦C, both with and without the
addition of sodium chloride (500 mM;
Figure 4). In absence of
NaCl, reasonable levels of PET degradation were observed, reaching
56 µ M product in the t 7 sample. However, higher levels of activity
were generated in the presence of NaCl, with 270 µ M of product
having accumulated in the equivalent t 7 sample. The progress
curves produced provide an insight into the initial rates of PET
hydrolysis by SM14est, which were calculated to be 0.02 s −1 for the
reaction with NaCl and in 0.004 s −1 in its absence ( R2 = 0.9976
and 0.8959, respectively). This represents a 5-fold diﬀerence in
the initial rate of product formation, and thus PET-hydrolyzing
activity, when sodium chloride is included in the reaction vs.
without the addition of salt.
RP-HPLC-based analysis (
Figure 5) was then performed to
identify the reaction products generated during the 7-h time-
course assay in
Figure 4. This provides a breakdown of individual
hydrolysis products, namely TPA, MHET, and BHET (shown here
as T, ET, and ETE, respectively); as well as soluble di-aromatic
oligomers which may include TET, TETE, ETETE. Tri-aromatic
oligomers were not detected in any of the samples. It is clear
from this analysis that SM14est displayed increased activity in

much higher quantities of PET degradation products. MHET was
detected as the primary product of hydrolysis in both the presence
(
Figure 5A) and absence ( Figure 5B) of sodium chloride; with
minor secondary conversion of MHET to TPA, being observed
with time.
/four.tnum. Discussion
To date, known PET-hydrolyzing enzymes are derived from
esterases, lipases, and cutinases, with thermostable proteins being
prioritized since PET is most easily hydrolyzed when reaction
conditions are set in accordance with the glass transition
temperature (T g) of the plastic polymer (
Lu et al., 2022 ). While
thermotolerant enzymes have yielded promising results for the
development of improved, bio-based recycling processes, it remains
crucial to study enzymes that can eﬃciently degrade PET, among
other plastics, under a variety of conditions to address the
widespread issue of residual plastic that ﬁnds its way into natural
ecosystems (
Carr et al., 2022 ).
In the suspension-based assay employed for the
characterization of SM14est, the aromatic ring structure present in
MHET, BHET, and TPA enables UV-detection of these products at
240 nm, thus providing insight into the enzyme’s PET hydrolase
activity (
Bååth et al., 2020 ). The substrate used here is of similar
crystallinity to that of post-consumer PET waste (30–40 %), but
exists in a powder form which is more readily depolymerized due
to the particle size and available surface area (
Gamerith et al.,
2017). Pre-treatment by grinding and micronization are currently
required for eﬃcient enzymatic recycling of PET and, importantly,
a large proportion of PET already exists as microparticles in the
environment (
Kawai, 2021).
While PET-hydrolyzing activity was observed at each
temperature tested, SM14est performed best at 45 ◦C ( Figure 3A).
Semi-crystalline PET is composed of both amorphous and
crystalline regions and its T g is 65–70 ◦C in water (
Kawai, 2021 ).
The amorphous chains of PET have increased mobility around
the T g, where they exist in a softened, rubber-like state (
Thomsen
et al., 2022 ). As reaction temperatures increase toward the T g,
PET becomes more malleable and enzymes can better access
its constituent chains, increasing the eﬃciency of hydrolysis
(
Figure 3A). SM14est has a T m around 55 ◦C, facilitating the
high levels of activity observed at 45 ◦C. By comparison, wildtype
IsPETase, the mesophilic model PET hydrolase, has a lower T m
of 49 ◦C, and displays optimal activity between 30 and 40 ◦C
(depending on the substrate) and loses activity after 1 h at
temperatures above 40 ◦C (
Son et al., 2019 ; Kawai, 2021).

Based on the observed eﬀect of increasing salt concentration,
it appears the SM14est enzyme is halophilic and displays good salt
tolerance (
Figure 2B). The average salinity of seawater is commonly
reported as being ∼3.5% or 600 mM NaCl, and the general
performance of the marine-derived SM14est seems to improve in
accordance with this concentration range. The beneﬁcial eﬀect of
sodium chloride on the activity of SM14est is further supported
by the progress curves and product proﬁles generated in the
presence and absence of salt (
Figures 4, 5). In a previous study
the halophilic PET hydrolase, PET6, from Vibrio gazogenes, was
reported to exhibit a preference for very high salt concentrations,
with optimum product release occurring between 1 and 1.5 M
sodium chloride, when incubated at 30 ◦C in PET-coated microtiter
plates while using the well-studied IsPETase as a reference (
Weigert
et al., 2022 ). At a ﬁxed concentration of sodium chloride (50 mM),
PET6 exhibited distinct optimal activity between 45 and 50 ◦C,
while IsPETase displayed optimal activity at 30 ◦C. In general,
IsPETase displayed optimal activity at low salt concentrations,
which rapidly decreases as ionic strength increases, while the
opposite eﬀect was observed for the PET6 enzyme. In the case
of PET6, higher salt concentrations appeared to confer thermal
stability, with a T m increase from 49.8 to 57.7 ◦C, and hence
superior activity (
Weigert et al., 2022 ).
Given the observed increase in SM14est activity with the
addition of sodium chloride, high salt conditions may elicit
a stabilizing eﬀect on SM14est, as seen with the halophilic
PET6. Multiple sequence alignment of SM14est with PET6
demonstrates 75.89% similarity between both their protein
sequences (
Table 1), including conservation of the serine hydrolase
catalytic triad (Ser163-Asp209-His241 in PET6; Ser131-Asp177-
His209 in SM14est) and GXSXG motif (GWSMG in PET6;
GHSMG in SM14est;
Supplementary Figure 2A ). The shared
α /β fold arrangement, which was visualized by superimposing
the Alpha-Fold model for SM14est onto the already resolved
PET6 crystal structure (chain A), is well-conserved between
these two enzymes (
Figure 6). Structural analysis of PET6
previously revealed binding sites for monovalent ions, where one
sodium ion interacts with Arg61, Ala63, and Phe65 residues,
a second sodium ion is associated with Asp282, Ser284, and
Val287, each occurring within a small loop via the amino acid
backbone carbonyl groups (
Weigert et al., 2022 ). In SM14est,
Arg32, Ser35, and Phe38 correspond to the ﬁrst ion site in
PET6, while Gly248, Thr250, and Val253 are found in a loop
around the second site (
Figure 6). In PET6, a chloride ion
sits in a shallow pocket comprised by Ala208, Asp209, Ala210,
Val211, Ser240, His241, Phe242, which is similarly present in
SM14est by Asn176, Asp177, Ala178, Ile179, Gly208, His209,
and Phe210 (
Figure 6; Weigert et al., 2022 ). This comparison
indicates structural similarity between the two enzymes, supporting
their potential adaptation to saline environments, which, when
combined with the observed promotion of activity by sodium
and chloride ions, provides further insights into marine-derived
polyester hydrolases.
The Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy) has recently
been established as a repository for enzymes with experimentally
conﬁrmed activities toward synthetic polymers, primarily those
which act on PET (
Buchholz et al., 2022 ). PET6, together with PE-
H from Pseudomonas aestusnigri , and Ple629 from Marinobacter
sp. are among the marine-derived PET hydrolases in the PAZy
collection. Although SM14est shares over 70% amino acid sequence
similarity with these three marine enzymes and between 32 and
34% sequence identity, it shares almost 80% similarity and just
over 46% sequence identity with one of the top performing
PET hydrolases, PHL7 (
Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2B ). An
engineered variant of PHL7 displays comparable activity to mutant
LCC (ICCG), generating high levels of degradation products on a
millimolar scale (
Kawai et al., 2022 ). The identity and similarity
percentages generated between SM14est and the benchmark
enzymes LCC and IsPETase also ranked above those of the
aforementioned marine examples, PET6, PE-H, and Ple629. This
may indicate a potential for SM14est to represent an interesting
“middle-ground” in the study of marine PET hydrolases, where
its sea-sponge origin is complemented by its similarity to enzymes
which have the highest known capacity for PET degradation. The
product proﬁles obtained for SM14est by RP-HPLC (
Figure 5) are
comparable to those generated for thermophilic PET-hydrolyzing

cutinases in a previous study, further evidencing the PET
degradation ability of SM14est (
Bååth et al., 2020 ).
Structural analysis and molecular docking experiments have
previously been conducted to identify important amino acid
residues in PHL7, particularly those contributing to its degradation
eﬃciency and those with binding aﬃnity for PET (
Sonnendecker
et al., 2022 ). The residues in the active site are highly conserved
between SM14est and PHL7 (chain B; Figure 7). Within the
substrate-binding cavity, Gly62, Thr64, Gln95, His130, Ser131 ,
Met132, Trp156, Asp177 , Ile179, Ala180, His209 , Leu210, and
Asn213 (catalytic triad residues underlined) are identical in
SM14est and PHL7 (colored in magenta), with diﬀerences at just
three positions; Tyr63, Thr69, and Tyr93 in SM14est correspond
to Phe63, Ser69, and Leu93 in PHL7 (colored in orange;
Figure 7).
In PHL7, Leu210 was proposed as a particularly important residue
for substrate binding and was experimentally veriﬁed to contribute
to higher activity of PHL7 over the near-identical enzyme PHL3,
which diﬀers only by four amino acids overall. When this leucine
was substituted for phenylalanine, which is found at this position
in other type I PET hydrolases, the activity of PHL7 decreased to
that of native PHL3 (
Sonnendecker et al., 2022 ). The occurrence of
leucine at position 210 in SM14est may have similar implications
for PET binding and catalysis. Based on the PAZy-deﬁned “PET
hydrolase core domain, ” Tyr63 in SM14est is likely to be an

aromatic oxyanion hole residue involved in stabilizing the PET
hydrolysis reaction intermediate, which occurs as tyrosine in
51% of homologous core domains (e.g., Tyr95 in LCC) and as
phenylalanine in 46% (e.g., Phe63 in PHL7;
Buchholz et al., 2022 ).
In another study of PHL7, the replacement of phenylalanine with
tyrosine at this position resulted in a variant with decreased
hydrolytic activity but further investigation would be required to
determine the role of Tyr63 in SM14est (
Pfaﬀ et al., 2022 ).
Since the identiﬁcation of IsPETase in 2016, there has been
an ongoing debate regarding the relevance of mesophilic PET
hydrolases in the context of plastic waste management (
Wallace
et al., 2020 ; Kawai, 2021 ; Wei et al., 2022 ). Previously, it was
highlighted that mesophilic PET hydrolases may be unsuitable
for enzymatic PET recycling given the temperature requirements
for eﬃcient hydrolysis and furthermore, that attempts to improve
the thermostability of IsPETase were contradictory to the original
claims that this enzyme could enable PET hydrolysis under mild
conditions (
Kawai, 2021). Based on a study of LCC (ICCG) mutant
and IsPETase molecular reaction mechanics, it has been suggested
that the superior activity of known thermostable PET hydrolases is
primarily due to the greater accessibility of PET polymer chains at
higher temperatures, as opposed to their speciﬁc interaction with
or aﬃnity for the substrate (
Boneta et al., 2021 ).
During the construction of the PAZy database, a PET hydrolase
core domain was determined by Hidden Markov Model-based
proﬁling and used to identify 2,930 homologs in the Lipase
Engineering Database (LED), which was then assessed in terms
of amino acid conservation (
Buchholz et al., 2022 ). Using the
LED PETase tool within PAZy, SM14est was aligned with IsPETase
to compare positions that have previously been proposed to
have structural or functional involvement in PET hydrolysis
(
Supplementary Figure 3 ). The isoleucine residue corresponding
to Ile179 in SM14est has been implicated as a key residue
for IsPETase substrate interaction. The tryptophan residue of
subsite I, found at position 156 in SM14est, is referred to as
the “wobbling tryptophan” in IsPETase since it is hypothesized
to adopt three diﬀerent conformations which confers increased
ﬂexibility within the substrate binding site. This eﬀect is likely
restricted in SM14est due to nearby His185 and Phe189 residues,
but in other cases these have been successfully substituted for
Ser and Ile (the neighboring residues in IsPETase) to enhance
tryptophan mobility and thus, PET-hydrolytic activity (
Aboelnga
and Kalyaanamoorthy, 2022 ; Brott et al., 2022 ). Nonetheless, this
tryptophan is believed to form stacking interactions with the
aromatic component of PET and it is conserved in 77% of PET
hydrolase core domain homologs (
Buchholz et al., 2022 ). While

many of the subsite I and II residues are equivalent in both IsPETase
and SM14est, SM14est does not display the same extension in
the second alpha-helix, another structural hallmark linked to
superior IsPETase activity at ambient temperature (
Sagong et al.,
2021).
Recently, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
(QM/MM) calculations have been employed for a more in-
depth examination of the PET hydrolysis reaction pathway
and the key structural features required for eﬃcient catalysis
(
Jerves et al., 2021 ; Aboelnga and Kalyaanamoorthy, 2022 ).
The IsPETase molecular features investigated, which enable the
accommodation of PET in an advantageous bent conformation and
promote tightened hydrogen bond interactions between catalytic
triad residues, could prove useful in the rational engineering
of SM14est. In particular, emphasis is placed on the role of
the unique disulﬁde bond present near the IsPETase active
site. Interestingly, the typical type I PET hydrolase disulﬁde
bond (DS1) and the additional disulﬁde bond of IsPETase
(DS2) are both absent from SM14est, which does not possess
any disulﬁde bridge. Since we have now demonstrated that
SM14est can use PET as a substrate, the introduction of DS1,
DS2, or both could oﬀer further insight into the role of such
bonds in PET hydrolysis. Furthermore, the overall structure
of SM14est could be modiﬁed using a machine learning-based
approach to generate improved variants. A self-supervised,
structure-based convolutional neural network called MutCompute
was recently implemented to identify stabilizing mutations
that resulted in FAST-PETase (functional, active, stable, and
tolerant PETase S121E/ D186H/ R224Q/ N233K/ R280A), which emerged
as an excellent candidate for in situ PET degradation when
compared with wild-type IsPETase, previously engineered variants
ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, as well as LCC and mutant LCC
(ICCM), across a pH range of 6.5–8.0 and ambient temperatures of
30–40◦C (
Lu et al., 2022 ).
Halophilic enzymes are more likely to be resistant to proteolysis
and denaturation by organic solvents and detergents, and often
display a longer half-life that is particularly advantageous during
the relatively slow process of plastic degradation (
Atanasova
et al., 2021 ). Plastic frequently contaminates marine and
other salt-rich natural environments, together with high-
salinity wastewaters, including those derived from agriculture,
aquacultural, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, that already
pose a threat to surrounding ecosystems (
Raju et al., 2018 ; Zhao
et al., 2020 ; Atanasova et al., 2021 ). This highlights the need for
bioremediation strategies that employ plastic-degrading bacteria
and their enzymes; such approaches are under-represented in
the ﬁeld of PET hydrolases, where the primary goal to date
has been to facilitate biological plastic recycling (
Atanasova
et al., 2021 ). Marine actinomycetes, including Streptomyces spp.,
that display halophilicity and halotolerance have previously
been isolated from saline environments and shown to be both
physiologically and metabolically distinct from their terrestrial
counterparts (
Almeida et al., 2019a ). The work presented here
on the PET-hydrolyzing activity of SM14est supports the need
for the continued investigation of marine microorganisms and
their enzymes, not only for the biological degradation of PET
and other plastics, but also for the identiﬁcation of industrially
relevant biocatalysts.
/five.tnum. Concluding remarks
While rapid advancements have been made in the study of
PET hydrolases, the problem of plastic waste is multi-faceted and
requires a diverse suite of microbes and enzymes to enable both
environmentally sound, closed-loop recycling as well as biological
remediation of plastic-contaminated sites. Here, the hydrolytic
activity of the marine polyesterase SM14est is characterized using
PET as a substrate. SM14est can hydrolyze PET at a range of
temperatures, most eﬃciently at 45 ◦C, but even as low as 10 ◦C,
which may be indicative of an ability to act on PET in its native
environment. Furthermore, SM14est displayed a strong preference
for pH 8 and high salt concentrations, each aligning with the typical
conditions found in ocean waters. Following structural protein
analyses, SM14est was shown to share similarities as well as key
diﬀerences with other well-characterized PET hydrolases, including
those from marine sources. Although there is a possibility that, as a
result of microbial evolution, the enzymatic machinery in marine
bacteria could become adapted to degrade the increasing levels
of plastics and microplastics to which they are being exposed, we
suspect that it is the promiscuous nature of hydrolase enzymes
such as SM14est that primarily facilitates the acceptance of an
unnatural substrate like PET. Nonetheless, given that marine-
speciﬁc actinomycetes have been studied and shown to populate
a variety of habitats, which as of yet remain a largely neglected
resource as of yet, this work on the sea sponge-derived Streptomyces
enzyme SM14est provides further incentive to explore diﬀerent
types of marine ecosystems as a source of novel enzymes with
potentially interesting biotechnological applications.
