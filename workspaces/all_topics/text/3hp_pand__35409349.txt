Abstract: One- or two-carbon (C1 or C2) compounds have been considered attractive substrates
because they are inexpensive and abundant. Methanol and ethanol are representative C1 and
C2 compounds, which can be used as bio-renewable platform feedstocks for the biotechnological
production of value-added natural chemicals. Methanol-derived formaldehyde and ethanol-derived
acetaldehyde can be converted to 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) via aldol condensation. 3-HPA is used
in food preservation and as a precursor for 3-hydroxypropionic acid and 1,3-propanediol that are
starting materials for manufacturing biocompatible plastic and polytrimethylene terephthalate. In
this study, 3-HPA was biosynthesized from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde using deoxyribose-5-
phosphate aldolase from Thermotoga maritima (DERATma) and cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli
for 3-HPA production. Under optimum conditions, DERATma produced 7 mM 3-HPA from 25 mM
substrate (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) for 60 min with 520 mg/L/h productivity. To demonstrate
the one-pot 3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol, we used methanol dehydrogenase from
Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (MDHLx) and DERATma. One-pot 3-HPA production via aldol condensation
of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde from methanol and ethanol, respectively, was investigated under
optimized reaction conditions. This is the ﬁrst report on 3-HPA production from inexpensive alcohol
substrates (methanol and ethanol) by cascade reaction using DERATma and MDHLx.

1. Introduction
One- or two-carbon (C1 or C2) compounds have been utilized as attractive substrates
for biotechnological production of valuable compounds because they are inexpensive and
can be used as bio-renewable platform feedstock [ 1,2]. The production of value-added
products from cheap C1 or C2 compounds via chemical processes has been extensively
studied [3,4]. However, these chemical processes occur under high temperatures and pres-
sures and release toxic by-products [5]. Recently, enzymatic processes using biocatalysts
have been developed to substitute chemical synthesis [6–8]. Methanol (C1) and ethanol
(C2) are major compounds considered next generation substrates that can be converted
to natural metabolite products, such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and acetyl-CoA-
derived products, in microorganisms via short biosynthetic pathways. Various biocatalysts,
such as alcohol oxidase, oxidoreductase, and methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), have been
considered to convert methanol and ethanol [ 9,10]. Among these enzymes, MDH (EC
1.1.1.244) is a key enzyme for alcohol oxidation, which catalyzes alcohol conversion to
aldehyde [11]. Previous studies have reported that MDH from Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus
(MDHLx) efﬁciently converts methanol and ethanol to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde,

respectively [12]. Alcohol-derived formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are also renewable feed-
stock that can be converted to chemical derivatives such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP),
3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA), and 1,3-propanediol (PDO), which are important precursors in
the industry [13]. To date, they have been produced from glucose or glycerol using metabol-
ically engineered cells, including those producing glycerol dehydrogenase and aldehyde
dehydrogenase enzymes [14–24]. Recently, deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) from
Thermotoga maritima (DERATma, E.C 4.1.2.4) has been introduced as an intermediate enzyme
to condense formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to 3-HPA for PDO biosynthesis in engineered
Escherichia coli [25]. In this metabolic pathway, aldol condensation between aldehydes is the
key reaction point; however, the typical limitations of metabolic engineering include a lack
of enzyme engineering or pathway design optimization. In vitro enzymatic reactions have
advantages such as enzyme controllability, pathway design, and increasing product titer
and yield; however, metabolic engineering in live cells cannot be controlled [26]. Moreover,
optimum reaction conditions for 3-HPA production or pathway optimization by applying
other enzymes have not been considered yet.
In this study, we optimized reaction conditions such as pH, temperature, DERATma
concentration, and formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations as substrates for 3-
HPA production. Moreover, we designed and performed a one-pot cascade reaction for
3-HPA biosynthesis from methanol and ethanol using two enzymes, MDHLx and DERATma
(Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on 3-HPA production from
methanol and ethanol by enzyme cascade reaction and will be a helpful study for metabolic
pathway optimization by applying optimal conditions to target enzymes. Moreover, this
study will contribute to the industrial application of DERA-based biocatalysts for the
production of high-value compounds from cheap C1 and C2 compounds using green and
eco-friendly processes.

xylanilyticus (MDHLx) efficiently converts methanol and ethanol to formaldehyde and ac-
etaldehyde, respectively [12]. Alcohol-deri ved formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are also 
renewable feedstock that can be converted to chemical derivatives such as 3-hydroxypro-
pionic acid (3-HP), 3-hydroxypropanal (3-H PA), and 1,3-propanediol (PDO), which are 
important precursors in the industry [13]. To date, they have been produced from glucose 
or glycerol using metabolically engineered cells, including those producing glycerol de-
hydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes [14–24]. Recently, deoxyribose-5-
phosphate aldolase (DERA) from Thermotoga maritima (DERATma, E.C 4.1.2.4) has been in-
troduced as an intermediate enzyme to condense formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to 3-
HPA for PDO biosynthesis in engineered Escherichia coli [25]. In this metabolic pathway, 
aldol condensation between aldehydes is the key reaction point; however, the typical lim-
itations of metabolic engineering include a lack of enzyme engineering or pathway design 
optimization. In vitro enzymatic reactions have advantages such as enzyme controllability, 
pathway design, and increasing product titer and yield; however, metabolic engineering 
in live cells cannot be controlled [26]. Moreover, optimum reaction conditions for 3-HPA 
production or pathway optimization by appl ying other enzymes have not been consid-
ered yet. 
In this study, we optimized reaction co nditions such as pH, temperature, DERA
Tma 
concentration, and formaldehyde and acetaldeh yde concentrations as substrates for 3-
HPA production. Moreover, we designed and performed a one-pot cascade reaction for 
3-HPA biosynthesis from methanol and ethanol using two enzymes, MDHLx and DERATma 
(Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on 3-HPA production from 
methanol and ethanol by enzyme cascade reac tion and will be a helpful study for meta-
bolic pathway optimization by applying optimal conditions to target enzymes. Moreover, 
this study will contribute to the industrial application of DERA-based biocatalysts for the 
production of high-value compounds from cheap C1 and C2 compounds using green and 
eco-friendly processes.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Characterization of DERATma
To obtain an enzyme with high aldol condensation activity, the gene encoding DERATma
was cloned and expressed in E. coli. To conﬁrm the molecular weight of DERA Tma, the
recombinant enzyme was puriﬁed from the crude cell extract as a soluble protein using a
nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+–NTA) column. The puriﬁed DERATma enzyme (approxi-
mately 29.4 kDa), which converts formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to 3-HPA (Figure 2a),
showed a single band in SDS-PAGE (Figure 2b). We used this enzyme to produce 3-HPA
from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The products were successfully analyzed using
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 3-HPA standards (Figures S1 and
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 3990 3 of 12
S2). To optimize the reaction conditions for 3-HPA production, we investigated the effects
of pH and temperature on DERA Tma activity toward formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
The DERATma activity was the highest at pH 7.0 and 40 ◦C (Figure 2c,d). Interestingly,
DERATma exhibited >80% optimum activity at pH 6.0–8.0; however, it decreased under
alkaline conditions.

ing a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+–NTA) column. The purified DERATma enzyme (ap-
proximately 29.4 kDa), which converts formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to 3-HPA (Figure 
2a), showed a single band in SDS-PAGE (Figure 2b). We used this enzyme to produce 3-
HPA from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The products were successfully analyzed us-
ing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 3-HPA standards (Figures S1 
and S2). To optimize the reaction conditions for 3-HPA production, we investigated the 
effects of pH and temperature on DERA Tma activity toward formaldehyde and acetalde-
hyde. The DERATma activity was the highest at pH 7.0 and 40 °C (Figure 2c and 2d). Inter-
estingly, DERATma exhibited > 80% optimum activity at pH 6.0–8.0; however, it decreased 
under alkaline conditions.

Rhodococcus erythropolis [34]; E. coli [29], Haemophilus influenzae [35], and Pseudomonas sy-

ature values for the optimal activity toward DRP of reported recombinant DERAs from P.

Substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of DERA Tma toward formaldehyde and 
acetaldehyde as the substrates were measured (Figure S3). The kcat and Km of DERATma for 
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 0.49 min −1 and 2.41 mM, and 0.51 min −1 and 6.95

The increasing order of pH values for the optimal activity toward deoxyribose phos-
phate (DRP) of reported recombinant DERAs from Thermococcus kodakaraensis [27]; Hyper-
thermus butylicus [28]; Pyrobaculum aerophilum [29], Yersiniasp. [30], Paenibacillus sp. [31], and

cus erythropolis [34]; E. coli [29], Haemophilus inﬂuenzae [35], and Pseudomonas syringae [36],
were 4.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5, respectively. The increasing order of temperature values
for the optimal activity toward DRP of reported recombinant DERAs from P. syringae [36];
H. inﬂuenzae [35]; Yersinia sp. [30] and Paenibacillus sp. [31]; H. japonica [32]; R. erythropo-
lis [34]; H. butylicus [28] and A. boonei [33]; T. kodakaraensis [27], were 25, 40, 50, 60, 65, 80,
and 90 ◦C, respectively.
Substrate speciﬁcity and kinetic parameters of DERATma toward formaldehyde and
acetaldehyde as the substrates were measured (Figure S3). The kcat and Km of DERATma
for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 0.49 min−1 and 2.41 mM, and 0.51 min−1 and
6.95 mM, respectively. The catalytic efﬁciency ( kcat/Km, min −1 mM) of DERA Tma for
formaldehyde was 2.8-fold higher than that for acetaldehyde, suggesting that DERATma
prefers formaldehyde (C1) than acetaldehyde (C2). Zeng et al. investigated the Km of
DERATma toward formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which were 2.54 and <1 mM (at pH
7.0 and 30 ◦C), respectively [25]. However, the Km for formaldehyde was similar to that
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 3990 4 of 12
reported previously, but theKm value for acetaldehyde was 7-fold higher than that reported
previously (at pH 7.0 and 40 ◦C). Moreover, the reported Km values for acetaldehyde in
other aldol reactions with sugar substrates for DERA isolated from Rattus norvegicus [37],
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum [38], E. coli [39], and Salmonella enterica [40] were 0.267, 1.1, 1.7,
and 3.5 mM, respectively, which were 26.1-, 6.3-, 4.1-, and 1.99-fold lower than that for
DERATma, respectively.
2.2. Production of 3-HP A from Formaldehyde and Acetaldehyde by DERATma
To conﬁrm the optimal reaction conditions, we determined the optimal DERA Tma
concentration. The optimal enzyme concentration for 3-HPA production was investigated
using 0.28, 0.55, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, 1.66, 1.94, 2.22, and 2.50 U/mL enzyme toward 10 mM
formaldehyde with 20 mM acetaldehyde. The 3-HPA production increased when us-
ing <1.66 U/mL enzyme; however, product concentration reached a plateau when using
>1.66 U/mL enzyme (Figure 3a). Therefore, we concluded that 1.66 U/mL is the optimal
enzyme concentration for 3-HPA production and used it for further studies. To optimize
the substrate concentrations, we further investigated 3-HPA production using 0–30 mM
formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. The 3-HPA production increased as formaldehyde concen-
tration increased (Figure 3b); however, 3-HPA amount reached a plateau above 15 mM
formaldehyde (Figure 3c). Moreover, the optimal acetaldehyde concentration for 3-HPA
production was 10 mM. Based on the substrate speciﬁcity results, it seems that DERATma
prefers formaldehyde as the substrate over acetaldehyde. Thus, we chose 15 mM formalde-
hyde and 10 mM acetaldehyde for 3-HPA production using DERATma, which yielded 7 mM
3-HPA from 25 mM substrates in 60 min with 520 mg/L/h productivity (Figure 4).
2.3. Optimization of the Cascade Reaction with DERATma and MDHLx
To investigate 3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol using a cascade reaction
(Figure 5a), we optimized the reaction conditions for DERATma and selected MDHLx A164F
as the best candidate for high concentration methanol oxidation (Figure S4b). Previous
studies have shown that MDHLx showed the highest activity at pH 9.0 and 55 ◦C in the
presence of 5 mM of Mg2+ and 3 mM of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) [12].
Interestingly, combined DERATma and MDHLx A164F showed a maximal activity at pH 7.4
and 45 ◦C (Figure 5b,c), which are slightly higher than those for the maximal activity of
DERATma enzyme alone. To improve the performance of the enzyme cascade reaction, we
identiﬁed the optimal DERATma and MDHLx A164F concentrations for 3-HPA biosynthesis
from 1 M methanol and ethanol, which were 1.66 and 0.026 U/mL, respectively (Figure S5).
Thus, we used 1.39 U/mL of DERA Tma and 0.026 U/mL of MDH Lx A164F for one-pot
3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 3990 4 of 13 
 
 
mM, respectively. The catalytic efficiency ( kcat/Km, min−1 mM) of DERA Tma for formalde-
hyde was 2.8-fold higher than that for acetaldehyde, suggesting that DERATma prefers for-
maldehyde (C1) than acetaldehyde (C2). Zeng et al. investigated the Km of DERA Tma to-
ward formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which were 2.54 and <1 mM (at pH 7.0 and 30 °C), 
respectively [25]. However, the K
m for formaldehyde was similar to that reported previ-
ously, but the Km value for acetaldehyde was 7-fold higher than that reported previously 
(at pH 7.0 and 40 °C). Moreover, the reported Km values for acetaldehyde in other aldol 
reactions with sugar substrates for DERA isolated from Rattus norvegicus [37], Lactiplanti-
bacillus plantarum [38], E. coli [39], and Salmonella enterica [40] were 0.267, 1.1, 1.7, and 3.5 
mM, respectively, which were 26.1-, 6.3-, 4.1-, and 1.99-fold lower than that for DERATma, 
respectively. 
2.2. Production of 3-HPA from Formaldehyde and Acetaldehyde by DERATma 
To confirm the optimal reaction conditions, we determined the optimal DERATma con-
centration. The optimal enzyme concentration for 3-HPA production was investigated us-
ing 0.28, 0.55, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, 1.66, 1.94, 2.22, and 2.50 U/mL enzyme toward 10 mM for-
maldehyde with 20 mM acetaldehyde. The 3-HPA production increased when using <1.66 
U/mL enzyme; however, product concentration reached a plateau when using >1.66 U/mL 
enzyme (Figure 3a). Therefore, we concluded that 1.66 U/mL is the optimal enzyme con-
centration for 3-HPA production and used it for further studies. To optimize the substrate 
concentrations, we further investigated 3-HPA production using 0–30 mM formaldehyde 
or acetaldehyde. The 3-HPA production increased as formaldehyde concentration in-
creased (Figure 3b); however, 3-HPA amount reached a plateau above 15 mM formalde-
hyde (Figure 3c). Moreover, the optimal acetaldehyde concentration for 3-HPA produc-
tion was 10 mM. Based on the substrate specificity results, it seems that DERA
Tma prefers 
formaldehyde as the substrate over acetal dehyde. Thus, we chose 15 mM formaldehyde 
and 10 mM acetaldehyde for 3-HPA production using DERA Tma, which yielded 7 mM 3-
HPA from 25 mM substrates in 60 min with 520 mg/L/h productivity (Figure 4).

resent the means of two separate experiments, and error bars represent the standard deviation. 
2.3. Optimization of the Cascade Reaction with DERATma and MDHLx 
To investigate 3-HPA production from me thanol and ethanol using a cascade reac-
tion (Figure 5a), we optimized the reaction conditions for DERA Tma and selected MDH Lx 
A164F as the best candidate for high concentration methanol oxidation (Figure S4b). Pre-
vious studies have shown that MDHLx showed the highest activity at pH 9.0 and 55 °C in 
the presence of 5 mM of Mg2+ and 3 mM of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 
[12]. Interestingly, combined DERA Tma and MDH Lx A164F showed a maximal activity at 
pH 7.4 and 45 °C (Figure 5b,c), which are slightly higher than those for the maximal activ-
ity of DERATma enzyme alone. To improve the performance of the enzyme cascade reaction, 
we identified the optimal DERA Tma and MDHLx A164F concentrations for 3-HPA biosyn-
thesis from 1 M methanol and ethanol, which were 1.66 and 0.026 U/mL, respectively (Fig-
ure S5). Thus, we used 1.39 U/mL of DERA Tma and 0.026 U/mL of MDH Lx A164F for one-
pot 3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol. 
Figure 4. Production of 3-HPA from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde by DERATma under optimized

means of two separate experiments, and error bars represent the standard deviation.

reactions by DERATma and MDHLx. The reactions were performed in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 6.0–8.0) 
and Tris buffer (pH 8.0–9.0) containing 2.22 U/mL DERATma, 0.01 U/mL MDHLx, 1 M methanol, 1 M 
ethanol, 5 mM Mg 2+, and 3 mM NAD + at 45 °C for 120 min. ( c) Effect of temperature for cascade 
reactions. The reactions were performed in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.22 U/mL DE-

temperature ranges for 120 min. Data represent the means of two separate experiments, and the 
error bars represent the standard deviation. 
To obtain the optimal concentrations of me thanol and ethanol as substrates, we in-
vestigated the enzyme cascade reactions for 3-HPA production using 0.05–1 M methanol 
in the presence of 1 M ethanol and 0.16–1 M ethanol in the presence of 1 M methanol 
(Figure 6). The concentration of 3-HPA increased as the methanol concentration increased; 
however, it reached a plateau when methanol concentration was above 0.8 M. Interest-
ingly, 3-HPA concentration decreased by incr easing the ethanol concentration above 0.1 
M ethanol. Previous studies have shown that MDH
Lx has higher catalytic efficiency to-
ward ethanol than toward methanol, which can cause interference between the two sub-
strates at the enzyme active site [12], indicating that both enzyme and substrate concen-
tration should be optimized. Finally, we selected 0.8 M methanol and 0.1 M ethanol as

temperature ranges for 120 min. Data represent the means of two separate experiments, and the error

To obtain the optimal concentrations of methanol and ethanol as substrates, we inves-
tigated the enzyme cascade reactions for 3-HPA production using 0.05–1 M methanol in the
presence of 1 M ethanol and 0.16–1 M ethanol in the presence of 1 M methanol (Figure 6).
The concentration of 3-HPA increased as the methanol concentration increased; however, it
reached a plateau when methanol concentration was above 0.8 M. Interestingly, 3-HPA con-
centration decreased by increasing the ethanol concentration above 0.1 M ethanol. Previous
studies have shown that MDHLx has higher catalytic efﬁciency toward ethanol than toward
methanol, which can cause interference between the two substrates at the enzyme active
site [12], indicating that both enzyme and substrate concentration should be optimized.
Finally, we selected 0.8 M methanol and 0.1 M ethanol as suitable substrate concentrations
to improve the performance of 3-HPA production.

2.4. One-Pot 3-HPA Biosynthesis from Methanol and Ethanol 
The optimal reaction conditions for th e one-pot 3-HPA biosynthesis using DERA Tma 
and MDH Lx A164F were pH 7.4, 45 °C, 1.66 U/mL of DERA Tma, 0.026 U/mL of MDH Lx 
A164F, 0.8 M of methanol, and 0.15 M of ethanol with 5 mM of Mg2+ and 3 mM of NAD+. 
Under these optimal conditions, time-course reactions for 3-HPA biosynthesis were con-
ducted (Figure 7).

Two biocatalysts produced 16.3 mg/L (0.22 mM) of 3-HPA from methanol and etha-

ducing valuable products from methanol and ethanol as cheap materials without carbon 
loss and by-product formation is important for value-added material biosynthesis via eco-
friendly processes. In addition, MDH and DERA with high activity should be developed 
using rational approach-based protein engineering or directed evolution in the future. Till 
date, 3-HPA has been produced as an intermedi ate by glucose or glycerol fermentation 
using wild-type strain cells and metabolically engineered cells such as E. coli

2.4. One-Pot 3-HP A Biosynthesis from Methanol and Ethanol
The optimal reaction conditions for the one-pot 3-HPA biosynthesis using DERATma
and MDHLx A164F were pH 7.4, 45 ◦C, 1.66 U/mL of DERATma, 0.026 U/mL of MDHLx
A164F, 0.8 M of methanol, and 0.15 M of ethanol with 5 mM of Mg 2+ and 3 mM of
NAD+. Under these optimal conditions, time-course reactions for 3-HPA biosynthesis
were conducted (Figure 7).
Two biocatalysts produced 16.3 mg/L (0.22 mM) of 3-HPA from methanol and ethanol
for 8 h with 2.04 mg/L/h productivity. Although the productivity was quite low, producing
valuable products from methanol and ethanol as cheap materials without carbon loss and
by-product formation is important for value-added material biosynthesis via eco-friendly
processes. In addition, MDH and DERA with high activity should be developed using ratio-
nal approach-based protein engineering or directed evolution in the future. Till date, 3-HPA
has been produced as an intermediate by glucose or glycerol fermentation using wild-type
strain cells and metabolically engineered cells such as E. coli [15,21,22,24,25,41], Lactobacil-
lus sp. [42–48], and Klebsiella pneumoniae [49–53]. 1,3-butanediol, 3,5-dihydroxypentanal,
and 3,5-dihydroxyhexanal [25]; acetate and lactate [ 15]; 2,3-butanediol [ 53] were major
by-products, respectively, during 3-HP or PDO production via 3-HPA as an intermediate.
Moreover, 3-HPA is a toxic intermediate product in bacteria and one of the limitations to
producing 3-HPA at a high concentration for further use in the biosynthetic pathway [14].

Thus, 3-HPA has not yet been reported as the main product. However, 3-HPA can be
designed as the main product, using enzymatic conversion. Furthermore, methanol and
ethanol are considered some of the most useful substrates for obtaining complex chemical
compounds. Therefore, these C1 or C2 chemicals have been used to produce valuable
products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, amino acids, organic acids, and other chemical
compounds using diverse biocatalysts [1,2]. Thus, processes for the utilization of C1 or C2
compounds as substrates for value-added product manufacturing should be developed in
further studies.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Chemicals and Materials
Ethanol, methanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and NAD + were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). PrimeSTAR® Max DNA polymerase for cloning the
DERA gene was purchased from Takara (Tokyo, Japan). T4 DNA ligase, T4 kinase, and
DpnI were obtained from NEB (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR product
puriﬁcation and gel extraction kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA).
QIA prep Spin mini-prep kit for plasmid preparation was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden,
Germany). Ni2+-NTA column for protein puriﬁcation was purchased from GE Healthcare
(New York, NY, USA). Oligonucleotides and plasmid sequencing services were provided
by Macrogen facility (Seoul, Republic of Korea). All materials for DNA techniques and
SDS–PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). All DNA and protein
techniques were carried out following the standard molecular biological protocols. 3-HPA
was provided by Korea Research Institute of Bioscience (KRIBB) and used for standard
curve using HPLC [54].
3.2. Gene Cloning
E. coli C2566 (New England Biolabs) and pET-28a(+) carrying kanamycin resistance
(Novagen; Madison, WI, USA) were used as host cells and expression vector, respectively.
The DERA gene (NCBI accession No. AE000512.1) from Thermotoga maritima, comprising
747 nucleotides (248 amino acids), was synthesized, and codon optimization was performed
to enhance expression yield in E. coli by Cosmogenetech facility (Seoul, Republic of Korea).
The synthesized gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-28a(+) with His6-tag at the
N-terminal domain. The DERA gene was ampliﬁed from the synthesized gene fragment
using PCR and then cleaned up using a PCR puriﬁcation kit (Promega). The primer
sequences used for gene cloning are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The ampliﬁed
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 3990 8 of 12
DNA fragments and linearized vector were ligated using Gibson Assembly Master Mix
(New England Biolabs). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli C2566 and then
plated on Luria Bertani (LB) agar supplemented with 30 µg/mL kanamycin to select the
kanamycin-resistant colony. The selected colony was isolated using the plasmid puriﬁcation
kit (Qiagen) and conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing at the Macrogen facility (Seoul, Korea).
3.3. Site-Directed Mutagenesis of MDHLx
To improve 3-HPA production, the previously reported MDH Lx was applied to a
one-pot reaction with DERA Tma [11]. To construct double-variants (K46E-A164F and
K318N-A164F) using site-directed mutagenesis, the plasmid template DNA containing
the MDHLx variants was added to the PCR mixture containing 10 pmol of each primer
(Table S1) with PrimeSTAR® Max [11]. The ampliﬁed products were treated with DpnI for
2 h at 37 ◦C to remove the methylated parental template and hybrid DNA. The treated
mixture was transformed into E. coli C2566. Each colony on the plate was collected and
sequenced.
3.4. Culture Conditions
Each plasmid, such as the DERA Tma and MDHLx variants, was transformed into
E. coli C2566 using electroporation (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). These transformants
(10–100 µL) were plated on LB agar with 30 µg/mL kanamycin, incubated at 37 ◦C
overnight (14–16 h), and then inoculated in 3 mL LB broth. Recombinant E. coli cells
harboring DERATma or MDHLx were cultivated in a 2-L ﬂask containing 250 mL LB broth
supplemented with 30 µg/mL kanamycin at 37 ◦C and 200 rpm. To induce DERA Tma
expression, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; ﬁnal concentration: 0.1 mM) was
added to the LB broth when the optical density of recombinant cells at 600 nm reached
0.6–0.8 and continuously cultivated at 30 ◦C with shaking at 200 rpm for overnight. In case
of MDHLx and its variants, the temperature was reduced to 20 ◦C after IPTG induction and
they were continuously cultivated overnight to induce enzyme expression [11].
3.5. DERATma and MDHLx Puriﬁcation
Recombinant E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8660 × g for 20 min
at 4 ◦C and then stored at −80 ◦C. Then, they were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris–HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.0) and disrupted on ice by ultrasonication for 10 min. The
disrupted cells were centrifuged at 31,660× g for 30 min at 4 ◦C to remove unbroken cells
and cell debris. The supernatant (crude extract) was loaded to a Ni2+–NTA column, and
the bound protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mM imidazole at 4 ◦C.
The puriﬁed enzyme was desalted with a 10 kDa Amicon ultra centrifugal ﬁltration tube
(Sigma-Aldrich), dialyzed with 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 7.0), and conﬁrmed using SDS–PAGE.
The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method.
3.6. Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Parameters
One unit (U) enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to
produce 1 µmol 3-HPA per minute at 40 ◦C and pH 7.0. The enzyme speciﬁc activity was
deﬁned as the product amount produced per enzyme amount per unit reaction time. Unless
otherwise stated, the reaction was conducted in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 7.0) containing
0.5 mg/mL enzyme at 40 ◦C for 10 min. To determine aldol condensation, the reaction
was performed using 20 mM formaldehyde and 20 mM acetaldehyde. Then, 15 µL diluted
samples and 50 µL 130 mM O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride dissolved in 33:15:2
(v/v/v) pyridine: methanol: water were mixed and incubated at 25 ◦C for 2 h. The samples
were diluted with 30 µL methanol, and 3-HPA was quantiﬁed using HPLC with 3-HPA as
the standard. The kinetic parameters of DERATma were measured with different substrate
concentrations. The kcat (min−1) and KM (mM) values were determined using non-linear
regression with Michaelis–Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

3.7. Effects of pH and Temperature on DERATma Activity
To evaluate the effect of pH on DERATma activity, pH values were varied from 5.5 to
9.0 using 20 mM MES buffer (pH 5.5–6.5), 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 6.5–8.0), and 20 mM Tris
buffer (pH 8.0–9.0) at 30 ◦C. The effect of temperature on DERATma activity was monitored
as a function of time by incubating at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 ◦C, and pH 7.0.
3.8. Effects of Enzyme and Substrate Concentrations on 3-HP A Production
To determine the optimal DERATma concentration for 3-HPA production from formalde-
hyde and acetaldehyde, 0.28–2.50 U/mL DERATma was incubated with 10 mM formalde-
hyde and 10 mM acetaldehyde. To determine the optimal substrate concentrations, the
reactions were performed with 1.66 U/mL DERATma and 0–30 mM formaldehyde or ac-
etaldehyde. Time-course reactions for 3-HPA production from formaldehyde and acetalde-
hyde were conducted with 1.66 U/mL DERATma for 180 min with 15 mM formaldehyde
and 10 mM acetaldehyde.
3.9. Optimization of Reaction Conditions for One-Pot 3-HP A Production from C1 and
C2 Compounds
To optimize the reaction conditions for 3-HPA production, the reactions were per-
formed with 5 mM Mg 2+, 3 mM NAD +, 1 M methanol, and 1 M ethanol in 20 mM Kpi
buffer (pH 7.4). The effect of temperature on enzyme stability was monitored as a function
of time by incubating at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 ◦C in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH
7.4) for 120 min. To evaluate the effect of pH on aldol activity, pH values were varied from
6.0 to 9.0 using 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH 6.0–8.0) and 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0–9.0)
for 120 min at 45 ◦C. To determine the optimum DERATma and MDHLx ratio, 0–2.22 U/mL
DERATma was used, while 0.01 U/mL MDHLx was used and 0–0.03 U/mL MDHLx were
used, while 1.39 U/mL DERA Tma was used at 45 ◦C for 120 min. To determine the op-
timal substrate concentrations, the reactions were performed in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH
7.4) containing 1.39 U/mL DERATma, 0.026 U/mL MDHLx, 5 mM Mg2+, and 3 mM NAD+
with 0–1 M methanol or ethanol for 120 min at 45 ◦C. Time-course reactions for one-pot
3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol were conducted in 20 mM Kpi buffer (pH
7.4) containing 1.39 U/mL DERA Tma, 0.026 U/mL MDH Lx, 5 mM Mg 2+, 3 mM NAD +,
800 mM methanol, and 100 mM ethanol at 45 ◦C for 480 min.
3.10. Analytical Methods
Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 3-HPA were quantiﬁed using HPLC equipped
with a Gemini® 5 µm C18 110 Å, LC column of 250 × 4.6 mm dimensions (Phenomenex,
CA, USA) after derivatization as follows: 15 µL supernatant or reaction solution was
mixed with O-benzylhydroxylaminehydrochloride solution (50 µL of 130 mM stock so-
lution in pyridine:methanol:water 33:15:2). After being incubated at 25 ◦C for 2 h, the
samples were diluted with 30 µL methanol and centrifuged at 8660 × g for 3 min. The
column was monitored by increasing the absorbance at 215 nm at 30 ◦C with a gradient
of mobile phase A (water/triﬂuoroacetic acid, 100/0.1, v/v) and mobile phase B (ace-
tonitrile/water/triﬂuoroacetic acid, 75/25/0.095, v/v/v) as follows: mobile phase B was
increased from 10% to 100% for 30 min, decreased to 10% for 30–32 min, and stabilized for
32–50 min at 1 mL/min ﬂow rate.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we identiﬁed the biosynthetic pathway of 3-HPA from formaldehyde
and acetaldehyde using DERA Tma, which also catalyzes bioconversion of the cheap C1
and C2 chemicals, such as methanol and ethanol, to 3-HPA via the MDHLx A164F cascade
reaction. We optimized the reaction conditions, including pH, temperature, and enzyme
and substrate concentrations, for DERA Tma activity and cascade reaction with MDH Lx
A164F to improve enzymatic 3-HPA bioconversion. This is the ﬁrst study on one-pot
3-HPA production from methanol and ethanol using two biocatalysts. In the future, the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 3990 10 of 12
results of this study could be useful for industrial value-added product production from
bio-renewable platform feedstocks via eco-friendly processes using biocatalysts.
