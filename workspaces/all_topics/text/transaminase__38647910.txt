Abstract 
(+)‑Neomenthylamine is an important industrial precursor used to synthesize high value‑added chemicals. Here, we 
report a novel biocatalytic route to synthesize (+)‑neomenthylamine by amination of readily available (−)‑menthone 
substrate using ω‑transaminase. By screening a panel of ω‑transaminases, an ω‑transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis 
JS17 was identified with considerable amination activity to (−)‑menthone, and then characterization of enzymatic 
properties was conducted for the enzyme. Under optimized conditions, 10 mM (−)‑menthone was transformed 
in a mild aqueous phase with 4.7 mM product yielded in 24 h. The biocatalytic route using inexpensive starting 
materials (ketone substrate and amino donor) and mild reaction conditions represents an easy and green approach 
for (+)‑neomenthylamine synthesis. This method underscores the potential of biocatalysts in the synthesis of unnatu‑
ral terpenoid amine derivatives.

Introduction
Enantiomerically amines are a significant class of inter -
mediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agro -
chemicals, and fine chemicals (Shin and Kim 1999; 
Fuchs et al. 2010; Ghislieri and Turner 2014; Costa et al. 
2017). Optically pure (+ )-neomenthylamine has been 
utilized as a building block for chiral stationary phase 
to resolute enantiomers in HPLC (Arlt et  al. 1991). 
Some (+ )-neomenthylamine derivatives were used as 
great umami flavor agents (Welschoff and Waldvogel 
2010) (Scheme 1 ).
Currently, all the synthetic pathways of (+ )-neomen -
thylamine rely on chemical methods with terpenoid 
initial reactants such as (− )-menthone (Wallach 1891; 
Kozlov et  al. 1981; Kozlov 1982). A conventional way 
was to convert (− )-menthone by reductive amination 
under Leuckart–Wallach conditions (Kitamura et  al. 
2002), which could obtain all the neomenthylamines 
isomers. An alternative approach was to reduce men -
thone oxime to amines under Bouveault–Blanc con -
ditions using an excess equivalent of sodium (Han 
et  al. 2017). Besides, dielectrically controlled resolu -
tion (DCR) of racemic neomenthol by (R ,R)-tartaric 
acid and electrochemical synthesis with mercury pool 
cathode were both used to produce optically pure 
(+)-neomenthylamine stereoselectively (Kulisch et  al. 
2011; Schmitt et  al. 2014; Reinscheid and Reinscheid 
2016). In recent reports, hydrogenation of menthone 
oxime to amines via gold catalysts could afford excel -
lent yields at 100 °C. The drawbacks of this system are 
the high cost of gold nanoparticles and use of high tem -
perature (Demidova et al. 2020).
Over the past 2 decades, biocatalysts are increas -
ingly being employed for the synthesis of chiral amines 
due to their mild reaction conditions, high chemo/
regio-selectivity, and atom economy advantages (Mayol 
et al. 2016; López-Iglesias et al. 2016; Wu and Li 2018; 
Hwang and Lee 2019; Cao et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). 
A remarkable example of industrial application is in the 
production process of the antidiabetic compound sitag -
liptin using an (R )-selective transaminase from Arthro -
bacter sp., which brought Merck about 6 billion U.S. 
dollars of revenue in 2016 (Savile et al. 2010; Ferrandi 
and Monti 2018).
In this study, we develop a simple and green biocata -
lytic route to synthesize (+ )-neomenthylamine. The 
reaction is achieved by amination of (− )-menthone 
with a newly screened ω-transaminase from Vibrio flu -
vialis JS17 using (S )-α-methylbenzylamine (S -MBA) as 
amino donor in a mild aqueous phase (Scheme  2). This 
biocatalytic approach features apparent sustainability 
advantages, including avoidance of costly and poison -
ous catalysts, mild temperature and pressure operating 
conditions, easy product separation and low environ -
mental impact, which is generally unmatched for tradi -
tional chemical methods.
Materials and methods
Materials
(−)-Menthone was purchased from Meryer Chemical 
Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All other rea -
gents of analytical grade were obtained from commer -
cial sources. Yeast extract and tryptone were purchased 
from Oxoid (Hampshire, UK). Genes were synthesized 
by Generay Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All 
transaminases, amine dehydrogenases, imine reduc -
tases, reductive aminases, and aminodeoxychorismate 
lyases were obtained from the enzyme libraries saved in 
our laboratory.
Gene cloning and expression
All genes were cloned into the pET-28a (+) vector and 
transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Positive 
transformants and strains preserved in glycerol stock 
were grown in Luria Broth media containing 50 μg/mL 
kanamycin overnight in a 37 °C incubator. Subsequently, 
the suspensions were transferred into Terrific Broth 
media for incubation until  OD600 reached to 0.6. Protein 
overexpression was induced by adding 0.2 mM isopropyl-
d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) followed by incubation 
for 24 h at 16  °C and 220 rpm. Cells were harvested by

centrifugation at 12,000×g. All cell pellets were stored 
at − 20 °C.
General screening
Screening reactions were carried out at 1 mL scale in 
Eppendorf tubes. Reaction I for the screening of amine 
dehydrogenases: 5 mM (−)-menthone, 1 mM  NAD+, 
1.5 mg/mL CbFDH, 0.2 g/mL AmDHs lysates in 5 M 
 NH4OH/NH4COOH buffer (pH 9.0). Reaction II for the 
screening of transaminases and aminodeoxychorismate 
lyases: 5 mM (−)-menthone, 50 mM DL-Ala or iso -
propylamine or 2-pentanamine, 0.5 mM pyridoxal-5′-
phosphate (PLP), 15  gcdw/L TAs or ADCLs whole cells, 
2% (v/v) DMSO in 100 mM KPB buffer (pH 8.0). Reaction 
III for the screening of imine reductases and reductive 
aminases: 5 mM (−)-menthone, 5 mM isopropylamine, 1 
mM  NADP+, 30 mM D-Glu, 3 mU/mg Bm GDH, 0.2 g/
mL IREDs or RedAms lysates in 100 mM KPB (pH 7.0). 
All the reactions were mixed in a  high-speed shaker at 
30  °C and 1000 rpm (Allsheng Instruments Co., Ltd., 
Hangzhou, China) and analyzed by GC–MS.
GC–MS analysis was performed on Shimadzu-QP2010 
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry equipped with 
a Rxi®-5Sil MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) (injec-
tor and detector temperatures at 250 °C, oven tempera -
ture at 80 °C, ion source temperature at 230  °C, split 
ratio at 30:1). For analysis, the injection volume was 1 μL 
and the temperature of column was initially set as 80  ℃, 
raised to 230 ℃ at 2 ℃  min−1 and held for 2 min.
Protein purification
Chromatography was performed on a Ni–NTA His-
trap column with the following buffers: buffer A: 50 
mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 10  mM imidazole, 0.375% 
(v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0; buffer B: 50 mM 
Tris, 500  mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 0.375% (v/v) 
β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0; buffer C: 50  mM Tris, 150 
mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 25% (v/v) glycerin, pH 7.0. All 
cells were resuspended and filtered through a 0.45-
µm low protein binding membrane. The column was 
equilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Sub -
sequently, enzymes were eluted with 75% buffer B after 
removal of non-specifically bound proteins with 25% 
buffer B. The purified enzymes were collected by buffer C 
and stored at −80 °C.
Activity assay
Enzyme activity assays of VfTA were performed at 30 °C 
for 20 min in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) 
containing 5 mM (−)-menthone as substrate, 30 mM S-
MBA as amino donor, 2 mM PLP , and 1.5 mg/mL puri -
fied enzyme. Reactions were quenched with 10 M NaOH 
solution, extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) 
and analyzed by GC. Kinetic parameters were deter -
mined for the amination of (−)-menthone with VfTA. 
Assay mixtures containing (0–50 mM) (−)-menthone, 
60 mM S-MBA, 2 mM PLP , 2mg/mL purified VfTA in 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) were incubated at 
30 °C for 20 min and quenched with 10 M NaOH solu -
tion. The quenched samples were extracted with MTBE 
and analyzed by GC for (+)-neomenthylamine. Similar 
conditions were used to determine kinetic parameters for 
S-MBA with VfTA. All data were subjected to nonlinear 
regression fitting in GraphPad Prism 9.0. or Origin 2018 
to obtain kinetic parameters.
GC analysis was performed on Shimadzu-2014 gas 
chromatography equipped with a DB-1701 column (30 
m × 0.25  mm, 0.25  μm) (injector temperature: 250  °C, 
split ratio: 30:1). For analysis, the injection volume was 1 
μL and the temperature of column was initially set as 50 
℃, raised to 90 ℃ at 10 ℃  min−1, and then increased to 
260 ℃ at 20 ℃  min−1.
Thermostability assay
Half-life and melting temperature (T m) assays of VfTA 
were determined in this study. The purified VfTA was 
diluted to 2 mg/mL with buffer C and incubated at 30 °C, 
40 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. Samples were extracted at 
regular intervals to calculate residual activity through GC 
analysis.
Data were subjected to first-order inactivation kinetic 
equation for nonlinear regression fitting to obtain t 1/2 
in Origin 2018. T m assays of VfTA were determined by 
detecting the CD absorbance values in the wavelength 
range of 180–260 nm at various temperatures using a 
circular dichroism spectrometer (Applied Photophys -
ics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Data were analyzed with Global 3 
analysis to determine Tm values.
Bioinformatics
MEGA 11 was used to perform multiple sequence align -
ment. Phylogenetic trees were built with the neighbor-
joining algorithm within the Molecular Evolutionary 
Genetics Analysis Version 11 (MEGA 11) and present 
the relative positions of the proteins labeled with species 
name (Lewis et al. 1995). Molecular modeling for this pro-
ject was performed using crystal structures of Vibrio flu -
vialis JS17 (PDB:5ZTX) and various ligands were docked 
by AutoDock Vina program package. The center grid box 
was defined by x, y, z coordinates of − 1.437, − 5.754, and 
20.424, respectively, with a volume size of 15*15*15.

Scale‑up protocol
A preparative-scale mixture with a volume of 300 mL, 
containing 10 mM (−)-menthone, 60 mM S-MBA, 2 mM 
PLP , and 100 g/L VfTA whole cells in potassium phos -
phate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm 
for 28 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 mL 10 M 
NaOH solution and extracted with MTBE (3 × 300 mL). 
The organic extract was dried over anhydrous  Na2SO4 
and concentrated under reduced pressure vacuum to 
obtain (+)-neomenthylamine product.
Boc derivatization
Mixture of 5 mmol (+)-neomenthylamine, 7.5 mmol di-
tert-butyl-dicarbonate, and 5 mmol TEA was dissolved 
in 500 mL  DCM. The reaction was maintained at room 
temperature with reflux using a condenser for 4 h. Reac -
tion mixture after concentration was separated on silica 
gel column with PE/EA = 200/1 (v/v). The organic phase 
was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 
(+)-Boc-neomenthylamine product.
Results and discussion
Discovery of an ω‑transaminase for amination 
of (−)‑menthone to (+)‑neomenthylamine
Since the enzymatic reaction pathway from (−)-men -
thone to (+)-neomenthylamine has not been reported 
yet, we dissected the chemical structure of (−)-menthone 
and observed that it features a cyclohexane skeleton with 
a carbonyl group and alkyl substitutions. Leveraging this 
characteristic, we devised a substrate analog screening 
strategy, employing the amination of cyclohexanone or 
its analogs as a model reaction to discover enzymes that 
can convert (−)-menthone to (+)-neomenthylamine. 
Subsequently, we screened 83 target enzymes from dif -
ferent sources capable of catalyzing amination reaction, 
including transaminases (TAs), imine reductases (IREDs), 
reductive amine enzymes (RedAms), amine dehydro -
genases (AmDHs), and aminodeoxychorismate lyases 
(ADCLs) (Koszelewski et al. 2011; Tufvesson et al. 2012; 
Skalden et al. 2015; Wetzl et al. 2016; Guo and Berglund 
2017; Ramsden et  al. 2019; Gavin et  al. 2019; Mangas-
Sanchez et al. 2020). After expressing and rescreening of 
the enzymes in the form of cell-free extract, we obtained 
a transaminase (VfTA) from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 (PDB: 
5ZTX) that can convert (−)-menthone into (+)-neomen -
thylamine successfully. A phylogenetic analysis was 
constructed to analyze the evolutionary relationship of 
VfTA with the previously reported ω-transaminases that 
catalyze the amination of cyclohexanone and its analogs 
(Fig. 1). As a result, VfTA was situated at the same clade 
with the transaminases from Pseudovibrio sp. WM33 and 
Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, demonstrat -
ing a relatively close evolutionary relationship with the 
two enzymes.
Different amino donors were then investigated for 
VfTA-catalyzed amination of menthone, and interest -
ingly, VfTA exhibited different activities and selectivities 
for different amino donors (Table 1). Compared with DL-
alanine and 2-pentanamine, using isopropylamine as the 
amino donor resulted in the highest yield of (+)-neomen-
thylamine by VfTA, reaching 0.19 mM with a conversion 
rate of 3.8%.

Optimization of system parameters for VfTA‑mediated 
transamination reaction
To improve the efficiency of VfTA-mediated reaction for 
(+)-neomenthylamine production, the effects of some 
reaction parameters were investigated, including amino 
donor types and equivalents, pH, temperature, and PLP 
dose. For transaminases, unfavorable thermodynamic 
equilibrium is an important bottleneck limiting the reac -
tion (Slabu et al. 2018), and adding excessive amino donor 
usually can help to overcome this defect. We selected 
nine commonly used amino donors with different carbon 
chain lengths and steric hindrance sizes. Among them, S-
MBA as an amino donor exhibited excellent catalytic effi-
ciency for the transaminase reaction (Fig. 2).
The optimal pH and temperature for the reaction were 
determined to be pH 6.0 (Fig.  3A) and 30  ℃ (Fig.  3B), 
respectively. The titer of (+)-neomenthylamine raised 
with the increase of amino donor equivalent, and the 
highest titer of (+)-neomenthylamine was observed when 
60 mM of S-MBA was loaded (Fig.  3C). However, further 
increase of amino donor equivalent posed a detrimen -
tal effect on the yield of (+)-neomenthylamine (Ge et al. 
2022). Besides, the dosage of cofactor PLP (pyridoxal-
5’-phosphate) was also optimized, indicating that 2 mM 
PLP was sufficient for the single-step reaction (Fig. 3D).
Kinetic analysis for VfTA showed potential co‑substrate 
and co‑product inhibition
VfTA from V. fluvialis  JS17 belongs to the class III 
transaminases of the fold type I PLP family, which fol -
lows a ping-pong bi-bi reaction mechanism (Slabu et al. 
2017). Amino donor S-MBA participates in the reaction 
as a co-substrate. Wild-type VfTA was purified and used 
for determination of kinetic constants (Table  2). As a 
result, VfTA had very limited catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) 
for the substrate (−)-menthone, whereas it had remark -
able higher catalytic efficiency (k cat/KM) for amino donor 
S-MBA.
In the structure of VfTA (PDB: 5ZTX), cofactor PLP 
was covalently linked to lysine 285 through Schiff base, 
forming a highly conserved catalytic domain. This link -
age affected the conformational stability and flexibility 
of the dimer interface, including the catalytic region 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S1). Next, we established molec -
ular models between crystal structure and different 
ligands through AutoDock Vina. The docking analysis 
showed that the ligand S -MBA adopted a flat confor -
mation within the binding pocket, while (− )-menthone 
faced more steric hindrance due to its inherent chair 
structure (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Meanwhile, pro -
tein–ligand interaction analysis revealed that S-MBA 
had more hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen 
bonds with surrounding residues compared with 
(−)-menthone, promoting its binding to the enzyme. 
The π–π stacking interaction between S -MBA and 
Y150 stabilized the binding of the amino donor, play -
ing a crucial role in activating activity (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S3). Notably, this situation was in accordance with 
the significantly lower K M value of VfTA for S -MBA

compared to (− )-menthone, indicating a stronger affin -
ity of VfTA toward S -MBA.
We also investigated whether the amination of 
(−)-menthone by VfTA was affected by substrate or prod-
uct inhibition during the reaction. Using the inhibition 
model established based on Michaelis–Menten equation 
(Choi et al. 2017), the corresponding inhibition constants 
were calculated (Table 2). Unusually, VfTA exhibited sub-
strate inhibition and product inhibition for S-MBA and 
acetophenone, while no corresponding inhibitions were 
detected for (−)-menthone and (+)-neomenthylamine. 
Furthermore, VfTA had a much lower K i value for aceto -
phenone compared with S-MBA, resulting in a ninefold 
difference in K i. Even when 20 mM acetophenone was 
added, the rate of enzymatic reaction was almost unde -
tectable (Table 3).
Thermostability analysis of VfTA
The thermostability of VfTA was explored by both melt -
ing temperature (T m) measurements and half-life (t 1/2) 
measurements after incubation at different temperatures.

The Tm value of VfTA (0.5 mg/mL) in KPB buffer (100 
mM, pH 6.0) was determined to be 65.6 °C (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S4). The deactivation rate constant (k d) and t1/2 
following the first-order enzymatic inactivation kinetic 
equation were also determined. As shown in Table  4 and 
Additional file  1: Fig. S4, the t 1/2 of VfTA at 30 °C was 
close to 2 days, and even at 50 °C, it could still be main -
tained for 3  h. Thus, it is evident that VfTA possesses 
commendable thermal stability.
300 mL preparative‑scale bioreaction
Finally, we performed a 300 mL preparative-scale 
bioreaction under optimal conditions, where the 
time-course analysis revealed that the yield of 
(+)-neomenthylamine reached a maximum 4.7 mM at 24 
h approximately  (Fig.  4). Surprisingly, we observed that 
(−)-menthone undergoes racemization in aqueous solu -
tion at the beginning of the reaction, generating a small 
portion of (+)-isomenthone. Subsequently, (+)-isomen -
thone was transaminated to produce (+)-isomenthyl -
amine, and the side reaction reached equilibrium after 
12 h. The reaction was incubated for 28 h, and after deri -
vatization and purification, 150 mg of N-Boc derivatized 
(+)-neomenthylamine product was obtained with 33% 
yield. [α] D

0.80 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H), 0.78–0.75 (m, 1H).
Thus, the pathway for synthesizing (+)-neomenthyl -
amine using biocatalyst has been well established, where 
mild aqueous conditions are used, all the reactants used 
in this route [(−)-menthone, S-MBA, and PLP] are 
inexpensive, and the process generated the easily remov -
able by-product acetophenone, with minor environ -
mental impact. In contrast to the previously reported 
chemical methods, the constructed biocatalytic approach 
could represent an easier and greener approach for 
(+)-neomenthylamine synthesis. A number of strategies 
that may be utilized to further enhance the yield, such as 
continuous feeding of amino donors, or in situ removal of 
co-products. In addition, a significant advantage of VfTA 
is its excellent stability. Freeze-dried VfTA enzyme pow -
der is readily available and could maintain its catalytic 
activity for decades when stored at 4 °C.
Conclusion
In summary, we developed a novel and simple route 
to achieve the biosynthesis of (+ )-neomenthylamine. 
By screening a number of wild-type enzymes, an 
ω-transaminase VfTA from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 capa -
ble of synthesizing (+ )-neomenthylamine was obtained. 
After systematic characterization of enzymatic prop -
erties and kinetics analysis, a 300 mL scaled-up bio -
reaction was conducted with considerable yield. In 
contrast to the previously reported chemical methods, 
the constructed biocatalytic approach avoided the use

of expensive and poisonous catalysts, harsh operation 
conditions, and generation of excess wastes, thus repre -
senting an easy and green approach for (+ )-neomenth -
ylamine synthesis. More works of protein engineering 
and process optimization may be necessary to further 
improve the efficiency of biotransformation and to 
minimize the waste of the excessive co-substrate. The 
refined enzymatic route might provide new accesses 
to other structurally varied terpene-derived primary 
amines and associated optically active compounds.
