Hemophilia B is a rare, X-linked bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males and is
caused by factor IX (FIX) gene variants, leading to spontaneous bleeding and impaired
ability to clot after injury or surgeries. Standard of care is prophylaxis to increase FIX levels.
DTX101 is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral serotype rh10 gene transfer vector
containing a codon-optimized wild-type human FIX coding sequence. The phase 1/2 open-
label, single-arm, multicenter, dose-ﬁnding 101HEMB01 study examined the safety/efﬁcacy
of DTX101 in adult males with hemophilia B; the 101HEMB02 follow-up study assessed long-
term outcomes. Participants received DTX101 as 1.6 × 10
12 (cohort 1; n = 3) or 5.0 × 1012
genome copies/kg (cohort 2; n = 3) at baseline and were monitored through week 44 (cohort
2) or 52 (cohort 1) in 101HEMB01, and 4 additional years in 101HEMB02. The primary end
point of 101HEMB01, peak plasma FIX level at week 6, showed median levels of 7.0 (range,
5.0-8.0) and 10.0 IU/dL (range, 6.0-16.0) in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Levels failed to
reach the 20 IU/dL target criteria; all participants required adjunct FIX replacement therapy
based on low FIX activity at intermediate time points. In 101HEMB01, 4 of 6 participants
experienced treatment-related adverse events of elevated transaminase levels (n = 3) and
fatigue (n = 1), and 1 experienced fatigue in 101HEMB02; none experienced related serious
adverse events. Elevated transaminase levels were asymptomatic and resolved with
steroids in all participants. The DTX101 program was halted for insufﬁcient treatment
response; however, from its completion, lessons can be learned regarding the design and
execution of gene therapy clinical trials, including additional optimization of transgene
sequence and immunosuppression protocols. The 101HEMB01 and 101HEMB02 studies
were registered atwww.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT02618915 and #NCT02971969,
respectively.
Introduction
Hemophilia B is a an X-linked bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, resulting from a
deﬁciency or dysfunction of coagulation factor IX (FIX), an essential component of hemostasis,1-3 with a
prevalence of ~1 in 30 000 males.4 Insufﬁcient FIX can lead to spontaneous bleeding, particularly into
joints (hemarthrosis), as well as impaired ability to properly clot after injury or surgeries.5 Hemophilia B

severity is classiﬁed based on the residual level of FIX activity as
mild (6-40 IU/dL), moderate (1-5 IU/dL), or severe (<1 IU/dL).5,6
Those with severe hemophilia B (<1 IU/dL FIX) can have recur-
rent spontaneous hemarthroses or deep-muscle bleeding, typically
2 to 5 times per month. Recurrent hemarthroses lead to hyper-
trophic synovitis, progressive osteochondral degradation, and ulti-
mately chronic hemophilic arthropathy, characterized by chronic
pain, joint deformity, and reduced mobility, severely affecting their
quality of life.
7
The current standard of care for the management of severe
hemophilia B is prophylaxis aimed at increasing FIX levels sufﬁ-
ciently to prevent bleeding episodes. Therapeutic options include
IV injections with FIX concentrates prophylactically to maintain
plasma FIX levels above critical thresholds, at least above 1 to 3 IU/
dL for standard replacement therapy, with spontaneous bleeding
uncommon at FIX levels >15 IU/dL.
8 Although this approach is
effective in preventing hemorrhage and has signiﬁcantly improved
the clinical management of hemophilia B, it comes with several
important limitations. Standard half-life FIX concentrates have
relatively short half-lives, requiring infusions 2 to 3 times per week
to maintain effective circulating levels of FIX.
8 Currently approved
extended half-life recombinant FIX concentrates require IV injec-
tions every 7 to 14 days. 8 FIX replacement therapy can be
complicated by the development of inhibitor antibodies in up to 3%
of patients, neutralizing the ef ﬁcacy of the FIX concentrates,
requiring alternative procoagulants, bypassing agents, for bleed
control.
9 Finally, as of 2020, only a small proportion of the global
population has access to prophylactic treatments for hemophilia,
resulting in a signiﬁcant worldwide burden of preventable chronic
suffering.10 Together, these limitations highlight the unmet need for
a novel treatment option for patients with hemophilia B.
Because hemophilia B is caused by defects within a single gene,F9,
it is an excellent candidate for gene therapy.11 Gene therapy has
been shown to have resulted in sustained FIX levels over the long
term, thereby preventing bleeding in patients with severe or mod-
erate hemophilia B.
8,12-15 Approaches commonly use recombinant
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors of varying serotypes to reliably
and efﬁciently introduce therapeutic transgenes into hepatocytes.12
AAV vectors are particularly well suited for hemophilia B gene
therapies, because they have particular tropism for hepatocytes in
the liver; FIX messenger RNA sequence can be packaged within the
AAV vector without the need for truncation, unlike FVIII in hemophilia
A gene therapies, and its expression can be regulated through
hepatocyte-speciﬁc promoter elements.
16 In November 2022, the
US Food and Drug Administration approved theﬁrst gene therapy
for the treatment of hemophilia B (etranacogene dezaparvovec;
Hemgenix; CSL Behring, King of Prussia, PA), a 1-time, single-dose
IV infusion of an AAV5 vector containing a highly active variant
(Padua variant) of FIX. Moreover, a second gene therapy has been
recently approved (April 2024) for the treatment of hemophilia B in
the United States (ﬁdanacogene elaparvovec-dzkt; Beqvez; Pﬁzer,
New York, NY). In light of these approvals, we present here the
longer-term outcomes from one of the early programs investigating
gene therapy for hemophilia B: DTX101.
DTX101 is a nonreplicating AAV serotype rh10 (AAVrh10) gene
transfer vector that contains a codon-optimized wild-type human
FIX coding sequence. Gene expression in DTX101 is driven by a
liver-speciﬁc enhancer and promoter. Notably, in murine models,
AAVrh10 has demonstrated liver-speciﬁc tropism, strong trans-
duction efﬁciency, and durability of protein expression, with no
adverse histopathological ﬁndings in the liver in nonclinical
studies.
17,18
The phase 1/2 open-label, single-arm, multicenter, dose-ﬁnding
101HEMB01 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT02618915)
examined the safety and efﬁcacy of DTX101 in adult male patients
with moderate to severe hemophilia B. 101HEMB01 was followed
by the noninterventional 101HEMB02 study ( ClinicalTrials.gov
identiﬁer: NCT02971969), which assessed the long-term safety,
tolerability, and efﬁcacy of DTX101 in patients who completed the
101HEMB01 study. Here, we present theﬁndings from both the
101HEMB01 and 101HEMB02 studies.
Methods
Study population
Participants were eligible for enrollment in 101HEMB01 if they
were males aged ≥18 years with moderate/severe or severe
hemophilia B with≤0.02 IU/dL of normal FIX activity, had at least
3 bleeding episodes per year requiring on-demand FIX treatment
or received a prophylactic FIX regimen, had≥100 exposure days
to FIX, had no documented history of anti-FIX antibodies, were
willing to stop prophylactic treatment with recombinant FIX at
speciﬁed time points within the study, and were negative for
preexisting neutralizing antibodies directed against the AAVrh10
vector capsid. To be eligible for 101HEMB02, participants had to
have completed the 101HEMB01 study through the week 44
(cohort 2) or 52 (cohort 1) visit. Participants were ineligible for the
study if they had a history of liver disease or had signi ﬁcant
hepatic in ﬂammation or cirrhosis (as evidenced by aspartate
transaminase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] >2× the
upper limit of normal, total bilirubin >1.5× the upper limit of
normal, alkaline phosphatase >2.5× the upper limit of normal,
platelet count <75 × 10
3/μL, or prothrombin time or international
normalized ratio >1.5× the upper limit of normal). In addition,
participants were ineligible if they had a history of HIV infection
and any of the following: CD4
+ cell count <350 cells per mm3,
change in antiretroviral therapy regimen within 6 months of study
start, or plasma viral load >200 copies/mL on 2 separate occa-
sions, as measured by polymerase chain reaction. All participants
provided written informed consent.
Study design
The 101HEMB01 study was a phase 1/2 open-label, single
ascending dose– ﬁnding trial of DTX101 (AAVrh10FIX) in partici-
pants with moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B. At the start of
the study, participants received a single IV infusion of DTX101 at a
dose level of either 1.6 × 10
12 genome copies/kg (cohort 1) or 5.0 ×
1012 genome copies/kg (cohort 2). Participants in cohorts 1 and 2
were monitored for 52 or 44 weeks, respectively, after DTX101
administration to determine the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment.
After completing the 101HEMB01 study, participants were eligible
to enter the noninterventional follow-up 101HEMB02 study, which
evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability, and efﬁcacy of DTX101
in this population. In 101HEMB02, participants were followed for a
minimum of 4 additional years, providing a total of 5 years of follow-
up after DTX101 administration (Figure 1).

If, at any point during the study, a participant experienced bleeding
episodes frequently, they could return to prophylactic FIX rescue
therapy at the investigator’s discretion. However, washout periods
preceded data collection visits, during which participants were
required to refrain from prophylactic FIX therapy. The duration of
these washout periods depended on the type of prophylactic FIX
therapy: 21 days for long-acting forms and 7 days for traditional
forms.
Stopping criteria leading to suspension of enrollment included the
death of a participant considered by the investigator to be related
to DTX101, aﬁvefold increase from baseline in ALT within theﬁrst
8 weeks after DTX101 administration, grade 2 toxicity considered
related to DTX101 persisting for >7 days, grade 3 toxicity
considered related to DTX101, and occurrence of a malignancy
considered related to DTX101. Participants were monitored and
followed for vector-induced immune hepatitis. If a >1.5-fold
increase in ALT from the participant ’s baseline level was
observed and considered related to DTX101 treatment, the
participant was treated with prednisone per a slightly modiﬁed
American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines
protocol. Participants were given prednisone 60 mg per day for
week 1, 40 mg per day for week 2, and 30 mg per day for weeks 3
and 4. Starting at week 5, prednisone was tapered by 5 mg per
week until liver enzymes reached baseline levels. Abnormal clini-
cally signiﬁcant laboratory values, including hematology, coagula-
tion panel, and clinical chemistry, considered related to DTX101
would lead to suspension of the study. If study enrollment was
suspended, all participants enrolled would remain in the study and
continue to be monitored through their completion or withdrawal
from the study.
These studies were designed, conducted, recorded, and reported
in accordance with the principles established by the World
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for
Medical Research Involving Human Patients. Institutional review
boards at each site approved the protocols. Investigators
obtained written informed consent from each participant. Prin-
cipal investigators and the sponsor, Dimension Therapeutics
(acquired by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc in November 2017),
designed the studies. The sponsors and authors/investigators
collected, analyzed, and interpreted the data. Authors vouch for
the completeness and accuracy of the data. This article was
written by the authors with medical writing support from the
sponsors. All authors had access to the data and agreed to
publish the article.
Outcome measures
The objective of 101HEMB01 was to determine the dose of
DTX101 that achieved or was closest to achieving the target peak
FIX activity of≥20% of normal. The primary efﬁcacy end point of
the study was the mean peak plasma FIX level 6 weeks after
DTX101 administration, as measured by activated partial throm-
boplastin time clot-based assay. In 101HEMB02, the primary efﬁ-
cacy end point was the change from baseline (before receiving
DTX101) in FIX activity at week 208 (cohort 1) or week 216
(cohort 2), both ±14 days, as determined by activated partial
thromboplastin time clot-based assay. In both studies, the primary
safety end points were the incidence of treatment-emergent
adverse events (AEs; TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)
within each cohort. Key secondary end points of the studies
included transaminase levels (AST and ALT) and the development
of FIX inhibitors.

Results
Baseline demographics and characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the 6 men (aged ≥18 years) who
enrolled in the 101HEMB01 study, are summarized inTable 1.I n
101HEMB01, participants were followed for a mean of 408.3
(standard deviation [SD], 23.3) and 342.0 days (SD, 21.6) in
cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. All 6 participants continued on to the
101HEMB02 follow-up study, in which they were followed for a
mean of 1466.0 (SD, 4.4) and 1517.0 days (SD, 19.1) in cohorts 1
and 2, respectively.
Primary efﬁcacy end points
At 101HEMB01 study baseline, the median plasma FIX levels were
2.0 (range, 1.0-2.0) and 1.0 IU/dL (range, 0.1-1.5) in cohorts 1 and
2, respectively. By week 6, the primary efﬁcacy end point of the
study was not met, with median levels in these groups improving to
7.0 (range, 5.0-8.0) and 10.0 IU/dL (range, 6.0-16.0), respectively,
both below the target criteria of 20 IU/dL. At week 208 of the
101HEMB02 study, FIX activity level was 66.0 IU/dL in cohort 1

(n = 1) and a median of 6.0 IU/dL (range, 3.0-14.0) in cohort 2
(n = 3), representing a change from baseline of 64.0 and 5.9 IU/dL,
respectively. However, it should be noted that all participants had
returned to receiving standard-of-care FIX replacement therapy,
starting at weeks 1, 1, and 11 (cohort 1) and 1, 18, and 18 (cohort
2), based on low measured FIX activity at intermediate time points.
Detailed synopses of the individual participants, including the
timing of FIX replacement therapy, are included asFigure 2. FIX
activity level was not assessed at week 156 for 1 participant in
cohort 1 and at week 208 for 2 participants in cohort 1, because
the participants were unable to return to the study site due to
COVID-19 restrictions.
Primary safety end points
During the 101HEMB01 study, 6 of 6 participants (100%) expe-
rienced at least 1 TEAE, with 1 participant experiencing an SAE
(Table 2). Of these, 4 participants experienced TEAEs (elevated
transaminase levels and fatigue) considered related to DTX101
treatment by study investigators (Table 3). No SAEs reported
during the 101HEMB01 study were considered by investigators to
be related to DTX101 treatment. Similarly, all participants (100%)
experienced at least 1 TEAE during the 101HEMB02 study
(Table 2). Of these, 1 TEAE (fatigue) and no SAE were found to be
related to DTX101 (Table 3). No participants discontinued from
either study due to a TEAE, and no TEAEs resulted in death.
Additional secondary end points
Mean ALT and AST levels rose throughout the 101HEMB01 study
after DTX101 administration in both cohorts (Figure 3A-B) and
were considered TEAEs in some participants. Numerically greater
rises in transaminase levels were observed in cohort 2, in which
participants received the higher dose of DTX101. Steroid treat-
ment was initiated in participants with TEAEs of elevated trans-
aminases, leading to resolution. Notably, participants with elevated
liver enzymes remained asymptomatic through normalization.
Transaminase levels remained within their respective normal
ranges throughout the 101HEMB02 study (Figure 3C-D). Notably,
the ALT levels of 1 participant in cohort 2 rose sharply after
DTX101 administration, peaking at 914 U/L on day 30 (Figure 3F),
triggering one of the predeﬁned stopping criteria. This participant
remained asymptomatic, was treated with prednisone 60 to
100 mg orally once per day, and their ALT levels returned to normal
by day 279.
No clinically meaningful changes were observed in clinical chem-
istry, hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis parameters or in mea-
surements of vital signs throughout either study (data not shown).
Levels of inhibitor to FIX remained low (<0.3 Bethesda units) for all
participants at all time points (data not shown), indicating no or
minimal immune response to the transgene.
Discussion
The 101HEMB01 study was a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm,
multicenter, dose-ﬁnding study designed to determine the safety,
tolerability, and efﬁcacy of DTX101 gene therapy in adult men with
moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B. All 6 participants
completed either 44 or 52 weeks of the 101HEMB01 study before
continuing to the 101HEMB02 follow-up study, in which they were
monitored for at least 4 additional years.
After DTX101 administration, participants in both the lower-
(cohort 1) and higher-dose groups (cohort 2) saw initial improve-
ments in FIX activity levels from predose levels. However, over time,
improvements waned, and FIX activity levels were variable for the
remainder of the 101HEMB01 study and throughout the
101HEMB02 follow-up study. All participants eventually required a
recombinant FIX treatment to maintain FIX activity to sufﬁciently
manage their disease.
Overall safetyﬁndings from both studies suggest that DTX101 was
generally well tolerated for at least 5 years among these partici-
pants. Most reported TEAEs were mild (grade 1) or moderate
(grade 2) in severity and included symptoms typical of hemophilia.
Four participants in the 101HEMB01 study had TEAEs considered
related to DTX101 treatment, consisting of elevated transaminases
and fatigue, and 1 participant had a related TEAE of fatigue in
101HEMB02. All related TEAEs resolved by study end. No par-
ticipants had SAEs considered related to treatment in either study.
Elevated transaminase levels (ALT and AST) are commonly used as
biomarkers of hepatotoxicity after liver-targeting gene therapies.
19
In this study, mean transaminase levels rose after DTX101
administration in both dose groups, with numerically higher levels in
cohort 2 than cohort 1. This observed difference is likely explained,
in part, by the higher dose level in these participants but also by a
single participant in cohort 2 who had particularly elevated trans-
aminase levels. By day 279, after steroid treatment, the AE of
elevated transaminase levels was considered resolved. Despite
elevated levels, this participant was asymptomatic and was never
hospitalized for the AE. Medical history review did not identify any
factors that could have predicted this ALT response, and it is
unknown why this occurred. These ﬁndings of elevated trans-
aminases are similar to other early studies of gene therapies for
hemophilia and other indications in which participants also devel-
oped elevated transaminase levels.
20-22 These participants also
remained asymptomatic, and elevated transaminase levels similarly
resolved with steroid use.
20-22
Due to the limited ability to raise FIX levels to the target, the
DTX101 program was ultimately discontinued after the
101HEMB01 study. Importantly, although one of the safety-
stopping criterion was met, the elevated transaminase levels did

not produce symptoms in participants and resolved with predni-
sone administration, and the discontinuation of the program was
not due to safety concerns over the therapy. Although it is truly
unknown why DTX101 failed to produce sufﬁcient FIX to amelio-
rate the symptoms of hemophilia B, there are several factors that
we hypothesize may have affected its success.
First, the FIX sequence used in DTX101 was designed with a fairly-
high CpG content (96 copies). Cell culture studies have suggested
that higher CpG content can increase transgene expression by
inﬂuencing transcriptional activity.
23 However, other studies using
AAV vector-based transgene expression, including other FIX gene
therapies, report loss of transgene expression due to CpG-induced
innate immune response.
24 Here, vector DNA activates the TLR9-
MyD88 pathway, and vector capsid-derived peptides are pre-
sented by major histocompatibility complex class 2 molecules,
recruiting capsid-speciﬁc CD4
+ T cells.25 In turn, dendritic cells
and capsid-speci ﬁc CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate
transduced hepatocytes in the liver, reducing transgene expres-
sion.
25 Indeed, murine studies have suggested that lowering or

depleting CpG sequences from vector genome can evade the
AAV-directed immune response, resulting in persistent transgene
expression.26 Similar studies report increased transgene expres-
sion by as much as twofold to threefold in the 24 hours after vector
administration.
27 Therefore, we hypothesize that the high CpG
content in the DTX101 FIX sequence may have resulted in a
stronger immune response than expected, thereby limiting trans-
genic efﬁciency. It is possible that a revised sequence with lower
CpG content would have performed better.
Additionally, elevated transaminase levels, such as those observed
within AAV-mediated liver-directed gene therapy for hemophilia,
can be accompanied by a reduction in transgene expression. It has
been hypothesized that the infusion of the transgenic vector
induces the formation of AAV capsid– speciﬁc CD8
+ T cells, which
in turn target transduced hepatocytes for destruction.20 This could
reduce the number of transduced cells, which, in turn, leads to
reduced transgene expression accompanying the increase in
transaminase levels.20 Indeed, participants in this study experi-
enced concurrent decreases in FIX activity approaching baseline
levels as transaminase levels rose. The observed decreases in FIX
activity were such that they warranted resumption of prophylaxis
with recombinant FIX in all participants from both cohorts to ensure
that their disease was well controlled. Theseﬁndings are consis-
tent with previous studies of gene therapy for hemophilia, in which
an inverse relationship was reported between FIX activity and
transaminase levels.
20-22 Participants in these other studies also
required the use of prophylactic recombinant FIX, to which they
responded well with no reported signs of inhibitor formation.
20,22
Although it is not known what truly led to the lack of efﬁcacy of
DTX101, there are several measures that could be implemented in
future trials to improve treatment efﬁcacy.
One common approach to mute the immune response to gene
therapy and enhance efﬁcacy is the use of immunomodulatory
agents.19 In this study, the observed spike in FIX activity levels after
DTX101 administration was followed closely by elevated trans-
aminase levels. Participants were reactively started on steroid
regimens (prednisone) after the detection of elevated transaminase
levels, which succeeded in reducing transaminase levels, but could
not restore lost transgenic efﬁcacy. Some studies have shown that
beginning a steroid regimen within the 48 hours of loss of trans-
genic FIX activity can prevent further loss of efﬁcacy, but it cannot
restore what has already been lost.
21,28 Because participants in
this study were assessed every 2 weeks for elevated transaminase
levels, steroid administration may have come too late to adequately
mute an immune response and sustain transgenic activity. Other
gene therapy studies conducted after this study used a prophy-
lactic steroid approach with a goal to attenuate the viral-induced
hepatitis seen in many AAV-based gene therapies, as summa-
rized by Prasad et al.
29 Across these studies, prophylactic steroid
administration ahead of or concomitantly with AAV therapy was
associated with minimal, if any, impact on transgenic expression,
whereas a reactive approach was associated with elevated liver
enzymes.
29 Future studies could further evaluate a prophylactic
approach to immunomodulation, which could potentially maximize
the survival and efﬁcacy of transduced hepatocytes.19
Finally, the speciﬁc sequence of the FIX gene used in DTX101 is that
of the wild type (WT) gene. Research into FIX variants has shown
that transgenic sequences with speciﬁc amino acid substitutions can
confer greater FIX activity than WT.
30,31 Perhaps the most heavily
researched is the Padua variant (FIX-R338L), which has been shown
to produce sixfold to eightfold higher speciﬁc activity than WT FIX.
31
Notably, the 2 recently approved gene therapies for hemophilia B
both use the Padua variant, and despite the amino acid substitution,
there were no FIX inhibitors observed in any participants.
14
The 101HEMB01 and 101HEMB02 studies were limited in part by
the small sample size of 6 participants divided between the 2
dosing groups. Due to the limited ef ﬁcacy observed in these
studies, all participants received additional treatment with recom-
binant FIX to manage their disease, which altered the measures of
FIX activity. Finally, due to the discontinuation of the DTX101
program after the 101HEMB01 study, several additional efﬁcacy
end points were not pursued in the 101HEMB02 study. The
discontinuation of DTX101 also limited the collection of safety
data, namely the longer-term effects of this gene therapy on liver
health through hepatic imaging or other methodologies. However,
an international registry has now been launched that can enroll
participants from past, current, and future gene therapy studies to
accumulate continued safety and efﬁcacy data outside of clinical
trials.

Although the loss of efﬁcacy observed in the 101HEMB01 and
101HEMB02 studies ultimately contributed to the discontinuation
of the DTX101 program for the treatment of hemophilia, the studies
provided several key insights to aid in the development of future
gene therapy initiatives.
