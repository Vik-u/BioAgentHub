ABSTRACT: Chiral N-heterocycles are a common motif in many active
pharmaceutical ingredients; however, their synthesis often relies on the use of
heavy metals. In recent years, several biocatalytic approaches have emerged to
reach enantiopurity. Here, we describe the asymmetric synthesis of 2-
substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines, starting from commercially available
ω-chloroketones by using transaminases, which has not yet been
comprehensively studied. Analytical yields of up to 90% and enantiomeric
excesses of up to >99.5% for each enantiomer were achieved, which has not
previously been shown for bulky substituents. This biocatalytic approach was
applied to synthesize (R)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)pyrrolidine on a 300 mg scale,
affording 84% isolated yield, with >99.5% ee.

■
INTRODUCTION
Chiral amines are important building blocks of many active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and agrochemicals;
1,2
however, their synthesis by nonenzymatic means usually
requires stoichiometric amounts of chiral auxiliaries or the use
of chiral rare metal catalysts.
3
On the other hand, an increasingly
large portfolio of enzymes has become available for the synthesis
of chiral amines, such as transaminases,
4
imine reductases
(including reductive aminases),
5
and amine dehydrogenases.
6
These enzymes have found applications in the synthesis of APIs
such as antidiabetic drug sitagliptin,
7
LSD1 inhibitor
GSK2879552,
8
JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib,
9
BTK inhibitor
nemtabrutinib,
10
and CDK2/4/6 inhibitor PF-06873600,
11
improving the efficiency and sustainability of these processes
on up to >100 kg scales.
12
Nitrogen-containing heterocycles
represent a privileged structure in many APIs,
13
and thus chiral
cyclic amines are especially important building blocks. Several
biocatalytic routes toward this moiety have been reported
(Figure 1A);
14−23
yet, an attractive strategy, biocatalytic
reductive amination of a ketone bearing a leaving group,
followed by spontaneous cyclization, remains to be explored
(Figure 1B).
7,24,25
Only three examples have been reported in
the literature, two of which produce the (R)-enantiomer in the
2-position.
7,24
The third example generates a 3-substituted
piperidine, but was abandoned during development due to the
instability of the aldehyde starting material, and no data on
conversions or yield were reported.
25
Transaminases (TAs) are
pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes catalyzing
the transfer of an amino group from a sacrificial amine donor to a
prochiral ketone substrate. Here, we describe their application in
the stereoselective synthesis of 2-substituted chiral pyrrolidines
and piperidines starting from commercially available ω-
chloroketones, employing isopropylamine (IPA) as the amine
donor (Figure 1C). Access to both enantiomers is reported for
the first time, and the effects of both methyl and electron-rich
and -deficient phenyl substituents are explored.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A panel of 10 TAs was selected, composed of five (S)- and five
(R)-selective enzymes, all of which have previously been
described. For the (S)-selective TAs, CvSTA
26
from Chromo-
bacterium violaceum, and HEwT (wt
27
and W56G mutant
28
)
from Halomonas elongata, as well as two TAs that have been
engineered to accept bulky−bulky ketones, 3FCR-4M
29
from
Ruegeria sp. TM1040, and PjSTA-R6-8
30
from Pseudomonas
jessenii were selected. For the (R)-selective TAs, AtRTA
31
from
Aspergillus terreus, TsRTA
32
from Thermomyces stellatus, ATA-
117 from Arthrobacter sp., as well as its evolved variants for the
synthesis of sitagliptin,
7
ATA-117-Rd6, and ATA-117-Rd11
were chosen. All TAs were produced by recombinant expression
in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and used as lyophilized cell-free
extracts (CFEs, SI Figure S1).

Initial reactions were set up using 5-chloropentan-2-one 1a
and 6-chlorohexan-2-one 1b as substrates (Figure 2, SI Figures
S2,3), with the best-performing variants summarized in Scheme
1. HEwT W56G showed the highest yields (determined by gas
chromatography (GC) with a calibration curve of the product)
and enantioselectivity among the (S)-selective TAs. Removing
the bulky tryptophan side chain alleviates steric clash with the
chloro-alkyl chain, allowing for the chloro-alkyl chain to extend
into the binding pocket, which one may speculate leads to a
more productive positioning (Figure 3), although more detailed
modeling would be required to confirm this hypothesis. A
similar effect on enantioselectivity has previously been reported
for HEwT mutants bearing a W56C mutation with p-substituted
acetophenones.
33
For the (R)-selective TAs, a trade-off between
GC yield and enantioselectivity was observed. The wild-type
TAs showed essentially complete enantioselectivities in almost
all cases. On the other hand, the engineered variants of ATA-117
showed higher analytical yields of the product but with reduced
ees. The improved conversions are likely due to enhanced
acceptance of IPA as the amine donor (SI Figures S2,3 see the
effect of 1 vs 0.5 M IPA on ATA-117 and the engineered
variants), for which the variants were optimized during the
evolutionary campaign, as well as their increased stability.
7
The
variants having been engineered to accept bulky−bulky ketones,
reduced enantioselectivity with the small−bulky ketones used
here was expected. While cyclization to the pyrrolidine was
spontaneous under the reaction conditions (the chloro-amine
was never detected), cyclization to the piperidine required
incubation with sodium hydroxide for 3 h, due to the additional
degree of freedom conferred by the extra methylene. Significant
levels of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of 1a were observed during
the biocatalytic reaction, whereas 1b was stable and only
degraded during the incubation with excess sodium hydroxide
(SI Figure S4).
2-Arylpyrrolidines are featured in several bioactive molecules,
such as nicotine, larotrectinib,
34
and MSC2530818 (Figure 4).
35
Thus, their synthesis from commercially available 4-chlorobu-
tyrophenones (1c-k) was investigated (Scheme 2). Given the
bulky−bulky nature of these substrates, the focus was shifted
toward the engineered TAs 3FCR-4M, PjSTA-R6-8, ATA-117-
Rd6, and ATA-117-Rd11. Preliminary tests using ATA-117-Rd6
indicated that higher reaction temperatures of 37 °C and longer
reaction times of 48 h were required for these more hindered
substrates (Figure 5). Thus, screening of the panel of substrates
against the panel of bulky−bulky TAs was carried out under
these conditions, the comprehensive results of which can be seen
in Supporting Figures S5−15. Hydrolysis and cyclopropane
formation were observed as the major nonenzymatic side
reactions (identified by liquid chromatography−mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS), see the SI). The desired products were

identified by comparison to authentic standards (commercial,
except 3d which was synthesized and characterized by NMR, see
the SI) as well as LC-MS (see the SI). The absolute
configurations were assigned based on the known selectivities
of ATA-117-Rd6
7
and PjSTA
30
for 1i and butyrophenone,
respectively, as well as consistent elution orders on the chiral GC
(see SI), and further confirmed by optical rotation for (R)-3f
(see below). For all substrates, ATA-117-Rd6 was the best (R)-
selective TA, whereas PjSTA-R6-8 was the best (S)-selective TA
(Scheme 2). ATA-117-Rd6 is less specialized than ATA-117-
Rd11 (6 vs 11 rounds of directed evolution toward the synthesis
of sitagliptin),
7
and thus may retain more promiscuity. IPA has
been reported to be an unsuitable amine donor for 3FCR-4M.
36
The additional mutations in ATA-117-Rd11 are concentrated at
the upper back of both the large and small binding pockets,
resulting in an enlarged cavity that may influence the dynamics
of the substrate entering the active site, as well as the tightness of
binding (SI Figure S16).
In the synthesis of 2-arylpyrrolidines 3c-k (Scheme 2), both
enzymes showed excellent (≥95% ee) and complementary
enantioselectivities, while high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) yields ranged from low (10%) to excellent
(90%). Of particular interest are products 3f and 3k, which are
motifs featured in the APIs larotrectinib, and MSC2530818
(Figure 4), respectively. In contrast, recent examples of the
asymmetric synthesis of 2-aryl-N-heterocycles employing a
reductive amination strategy using transition-metal catalysts are
mostly limited to <90% ee, with only a few exceptions.
37−39
Biocatalytic imine reduction using IREDs generally reaches >99
ee;
22
however, the starting imines for this strategy are typically
not commercially available. Fanourakis et al.
40
reported the
synthesis of (R)-3c in 33% yield and 89% ee starting from readily
available 4-phenylbutan-1-ol by employing an asymmetric
benzylic C-H activation strategy, followed by Mitsunobu
cyclization and deprotection.

In the case of ATA-117-Rd6, para-substitution with an
electron-donating methoxy group resulted in decreased yield,
whereas electron-withdrawing chloride, fluoride, and to a lesser
extent cyano in that position was beneficial. Fluoride in the
ortho-position was also beneficial, with di-substitution in both
positions showing a synergistic effect. However, a meta-fluoro-
substituent resulted in decreased yield even in the presence of an
additional ortho-fluoro group. Docking of the quinonoid
intermediates for each substrate (SI Figures S17−26) showed
that substitutions on the phenyl ring result in a more twisted
configuration around the Cα-N bond. Electron-withdrawing
substituents likely increase the yield by increasing the electro-
philicity of the carbonyl, increasing its reactivity. The additional
increase in yield for the para-halogenated compounds may be
explained by a π-halogen interaction
41
with Y61 of the
neighboring subunit. A structural explanation for the decreased
yields with meta-fluoride remains elusive.
PjSTA-R6-8 largely showed similar trends to ATA-117-Rd6
with some notable exceptions; a para-cyano group was
detrimental compared to no substitution, whereas meta-
fluorination was beneficial, with 2′,5′-difluorination being highly
beneficial. This effect may be due to the meta-fluoro group
pointing into the active site entrance, allowing the ortho-fluoride
to form a hydrogen bond with the PLP hydroxy group and K288.
para-Fluorination appears to disrupt the possibility for this
hydrogen bond, which may explain why 2′,4′-difluorination
exhibited similar HPLC yields to para-fluorination and
decreased HPLC yields compared to ortho-fluorination (SI
Figures S27−36).
Curiously, PjSTA-R6-8 only showed very slight preference for
the electronically activating para-nitrile group over the
electronically deactivating para-methoxy substituent. This
preference may be due to steric interactions of the linear nitrile
group with M54 and L417, which are reduced with the flexible
bent methoxy group, as well as additional beneficial hydro-
phobic interactions of the methyl group with M54, L57, and
M58 (SI Figures S27−29). For most substrates, PjSTA-R6-8
showed higher HPLC yields than ATA-117-Rd6. For the
synthesis of 2-arylpiperidine 3l, additional incubation with base
was required to complete cyclization, whereas the 3-chloro-
propiophenone 1m rapidly degraded and no transaminated
product was observed (the major degradation product was 3-
isopropylamino-propiophenone, as determined by LC-MS, see
SI).
The synthesis of 3f was then scaled up to 300 mg of starting
material using ATA-117-Rd6 (Scheme 3), giving the tosylate salt
of (R)-3f in 84% isolated yield (95% NMR purity, main
impurities being water and DMSO), with >99.5% ee. As the
substrate 1f is only partially soluble under the reaction
conditions, vigorous stirring, higher temperature, and prolonged
reaction times were needed to achieve high conversions at this
scale due to the lower relative surface area of the aggregated
starting material, resulting in reduced mass transfer compared to
the analytical scale. The specific rotation (see below) of the free
amine of (R)-3f was consistent with the literature.

■
CONCLUSIONS
A panel of chiral 2-substituted pyrrolidine and piperidines was
synthesized starting from commercially available ω-chloroke-
tones. Both enantiomers could be accessed by choosing the
corresponding transaminase, with ees >95% in all cases, and
analytical yields ranging from 10% to 90%. Chiral azetidines
could not be accessed using this strategy as the starting material
was not sufficiently stable under the reaction conditions.
Isolation of the product on preparative scale was also possible,
the product amine being easily precipitated from MTBE using
tosic acid. Thus, the strategy described herein represents a
powerful and straightforward way to access chiral pyrrolidine
and piperidines on a laboratory scale, with potential applications
in drug discovery.
43−45
The long reaction times, as well as high
enzyme loading (83 wt %) require further improvement of the
enzymes identified, for example, by directed evolution. Best
results for the generation of (R)-2-aryl pyrrolidines and
piperidines were obtained with ATA-117-Rd6 rather than the
usual choice of ATA-117-Rd11 for bulky-bulky ketones,
46
highlighting that the most engineered enzyme for one specific
substrate does not necessarily have the broadest substrate scope.

Transaminase Production
HEwT, HEwT W56G, and PjSTA-R6-8 were produced by recombinant
expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) in ZYP autoinduction medium at 30
°C (24 °C for PjSTA-R6-8) overnight.
27
All other transaminases were
produced by recombinant expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) in TB-lac
medium at 25 °C overnight.
32
Lyophilized cell-free extracts were then
prepared. Further details can be found in the SI.
Analytical Scale Reactions
Reactions were set up by combining in the following order: potassium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 8), PLP (10 mM stock in buffer)
isopropylamine (2 M stock (pH adjusted with HCl) in buffer),
substrate (250 or 1 M stock in DMSO), and transaminase (50 mg/mL
stock in buffer), to give biotransformations (500 μL) containing the
desired concentrations of components as referred to in the manuscript
(Table S2). Biotransformations were then incubated at 30 or 37 °C, 700
rpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer C), for 22−48 h, as indicated in the
manuscript. For 6-chlorohexan-2-one (1b), sodium hydroxide (100 μL,
10 M) was added, followed by further incubation for 3 h. For o-fluoro-5-
chlorovalerophenone (1l), sodium hydroxide (50 μL, 10 M) was
added, followed by further incubation for 1 h.
For 5-chloropentan-2-one (1a) and 6-chlorohexan-2-one (1b), the
reactions were allowed to cool and extracted by adding EtOAc (1 mL),
followed by NaOH (10 M, 100 μL; 5-chloropentan-2-one (1a) only;
adding base after adding solvent suppresses cyclopropanation). The
extract was further diluted (400 + 600 μL EtOAc), acetylated (20 μL
each of Et
3
N + Ac
2
O), and analyzed by both achiral and chiral gas
chromatography (GC).
For all other substrates, the reactions were allowed to cool and
quenched with acetonitrile (1 vol). An aliquot was further diluted (40
μL + 280 μL H
2
O + TFA (0.2%) + 280 μL MeCN), centrifuged, and
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
(Alternatively, 100 μL sample + 450 μL H
2
O + HCl (0.2%) + 280
μL MeCN for LC-MS.) The remainder was alkalized with NaOH (10
M, 80 μL; except o-fluoro-5-chlorovalerophenone (1l)) and extracted
into EtOAc (1 mL), acetylated (20 μL each of Et
3
N + Ac
2
O), and
analyzed by chiral GC.
Preparative Scale Reaction�Synthesis of (R)-3f·TsOH
In a round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar, 1f (300
mg, 1.38 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO (5 mL) after which IPA (12.5
mL of 2 M stock pH adjusted (HCl) stock in KP
i
-buffer (100 mM, pH
8)) was added. To the cloudy suspension was then added ATA-117-
Rd6 (250 mg), which had been rehydrated in buffer (7.5 mL of PLP
(3.33 mM) in KP
i
-buffer (100 mM, pH 8)). The reaction was then
protected from light (aluminum foil) and stirred vigorously (just below
vortex formation) at 40 °C (oil bath) for 72 h. The reaction was allowed
to cool, acidified to pH < 3 (320 μL of conc. HCl), and extracted with
EtOAc (2 × 10 mL), breaking the emulsion with centrifugation (5000g
for 1 min). The aqueous phase was then basified to pH >11 (3 mL of 10
M NaOH) and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL), breaking the
emulsion with centrifugation (5000g for 1 min). The organic extracts
were combined, dried with MgSO
4
, and concentrated in vacuo. The oily
residue was then re-dissolved in methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE; 3 mL),
and tosic acid monohydrate (270 mg, 1.42 mmol), pre-dissolved in
MTBE (5 mL), was slowly added, causing immediate precipitation.
After incubation at −20 °C for 30 min, the solid was separated by
vacuum filtration, washed with ice-cold MTBE (2 × 2 mL), and dried
overnight at 0.34 mbar, giving fine free-flowing white crystals of (R)-
3f.TsOH (441 mg, 95% purity (
1
