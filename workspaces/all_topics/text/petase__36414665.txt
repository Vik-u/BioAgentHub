The process of recycling poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) remains a major
challenge due to the enzymatic degradation of high-crystallinity PET (hcPET).
Recently, a bacterial PET-degradingenzyme, PETase, was found to have the
ability to degrade the hcPET, but with low enzymatic activity. Here we present
an engineered whole-cell biocatalyst to simulate both the adsorption and
degradation steps in the enzymatic degradation process of PETase to achieve
the efﬁcient degradation of hcPET. Our data shows that the adhesive unit
hydrophobin and degradation unit PETase are functionally displayed on the
surface of yeast cells. The turnover rateof the whole-cell biocatalyst toward
hcPET (crystallinity of 45%) dramatically increases approximately 328.8-fold
compared with that of puriﬁed PETase at 30 °C. In addition, molecular
dynamics simulations explain how the enhanced adhesion can promote the
enzymatic degradation of PET. This study demonstrates engineering the
whole-cell catalyst is an efﬁcient strategy for biodegradation of PET.
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is among the most used plastics
around the world1,2. However, large amounts of nondegradable PET
waste has rapidly accumulated in ecosystems worldwide and has
become a global issue
3. Chemical, physical, and biological methods of
recycling PET waste have been performed to counter this severe
environmental problem
4,5. Among these recycling methods, enzymatic
hydrolysis of PET can provide a green route for recycling PET and
exhibits several advantages, such as being environmentally friendly,
saving energy, and minimizing waste
6–8. In the last decade, a variety of
PET hydrolases have been found, including esterases, lipases, and
cutinases9–12. These enzymes can depolymerize amorphous or low-
crystallinity PET to a certain extent. A recent landmark study showed
that a genetically engineered LCC enzyme could achieve a minimum
90% depolymerization of the postconsumer colored-ﬂake PET waste
within 10 h at 72 °C;
9 however, most of the reported PET hydrolases
can hardly degrade the high-crystallinity PET (hcPET) that is routinely
used for manufacturing bottles and textiles at mild temaperatures
6,13.
In 2016, a research group from Keio University identiﬁed a novel
PET-hydrolyzing enzyme named PETase from the bacteriumIdeonella
sakaiensis 201-F614. One of the most important characteristics of

PETase is its ability to degrade hcPET at a low temperature (30 °C); due
to this property, PETase is a promising candidate for a practical
method of recycling PET. However, the industrial application of PETase
faces a substantial problem, i.e., the enzymatic activity of PETase
toward hcPET remains low. Some pioneering studies have been con-
ducted to address this issue. Numerous enzyme mutants have been
rationally designed based on the structure of PETase and exhibited an
increase in enzymatic activity toward low-crystallinity PET (lcPET)
15–17.
Only a few PETase mutants can improve the degradation capacity of
hcPET to some extent
9,18–22. Although previous studies demonstrated
that redesigning PETase was a promising route to enhance its enzyme
performance, the current enzymatic activity of PETase and its variants
remains insufﬁcient to realize the industrial application of hcPET
degradation.
How can the degradation ef ﬁciency of PETase be further
increased? The enzymatic degradation of PET is a two-step process in
which the enzyme binds to the polymer substrate and subsequently
catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage
23,24. So far, most studies on PETase have
focused on the second catalytic step15,16,18,19,22,25–27, and the possible
impact of the adsorption step on the degradation efﬁciency of
PETase has received little attention19,28–33. Recently, we constructed a
whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase on the surface of yeast
cells
34. Considering that the whole-cell biocatalyst showed certain
advantages over puriﬁed PETase, we continued to optimize the sur-
face display system to further increase its degradation efﬁciency
toward hcPET. By analyzing the crystal structure of PETase, it was
clear that PETase lacked apparent substrate binding motifs, such as
the carbohydrate-binding modules, which are generally observed in
glycoside hydrolases
15,16. Several binding modules have been repor-
ted to enhance the enzymatic degradation of polymers by
increasing enzyme adsorption
31,35. Therefore, it is possible to increase
the degradation efﬁciency of the whole-cell biocatalyst by introdu-
cing an external adhesive unit into the surface display system to
control the process of PETase-displaying cells adsorbing on the PET
surface.
Hydrophobins (HFBs), a type of small secreted protein produced
by ﬁlamentous fungi, play different roles in fungal growth and devel-
opment, such as the production and dispersion of spores, formation of
aerial hyphae, and stabilization of fruiting body structures
36–39.I n
addition to their roles in aerial growth and reproduction, HFBs can
mediate fungal attachment to hydrophobic surfaces
40. For example,
hydrophobic conidiospores that are dispersed by wind or insects easily
adhere to water-repellent biotic or abiotic substrates41.T h eS C 3
hydrophobin is involved in attachingSchizophyllum communehyphae
to hydrophobic surfaces, such as Teﬂon. These interesting phenomena
were attributed to the self-assembly of HFBs at the interface between
the cell wall and the hydrophobic substrate
42.D u r i n gt h es e l f - a s s e m b l y
process, a hydrophobic patch on the hydrophobin surface could bind
to hydrophobic surfaces through strong hydrophobic interactions43–46.
Due to its unique amphipathic protein structure, hydrophobin plays a
natural role in manipulating the cell surface hydrophobicity ofﬁla-
mentous fungi. Furthermore, hydrophobin has been demonstrated to
increase the attachment of several enzymes (including PET-degrading
enzymes) onto different substrates in vitro
47–49.T h es p e c u l a t e d
mechanism that underlies these observations is that hydrophobin can
wet the surface of PET, and as a result, enzymes can more easily con-
tact and attack the hydrophobin-modiﬁed PET surface
29,49,50.I n s p i r e d
by this appealing property of hydrophobin, we proposed that hydro-
phobin could be used to modify the surface hydrophobicity of PETase-
displaying yeast cells to facilitate their attachment on the hydrophobic
PET surface and ultimately enhance the degradation efﬁciency of the
whole-cell biocatalyst. To test our idea, we developed a codisplay
system by simultaneously displaying PETase and hydrophobin on the
yeast surface. We used the class II hydrophobin I fromTrichoderma
reesei (HFBI) as an example, which is a small, amphiphilic globular
protein that readily self-assembles at hydrophilic and hydrophobic
interfaces
51,52.
In this work, the data conﬁrms that both PETase and HFBI are
functionally displayed on the yeast cell surface. The displayed HFBI can
profoundly increase the hydrophobicity of the yeast cells; thus, as
expected, the attachment of codisplayed cells onto the PET surface is
improved. This codisplay system shows ~328.8-fold higher degrada-
tion efﬁciency than that of the native PETase toward the hcPET (crys-
tallinity of 45%) at 30 °C. The corresponding conversion level for hcPET
is ~10.9% (depolymerization rate of 20.92 mg
products d−1 mgenzyme
−1)a t
30 °C within 10 days. Our study provides a rational organization of
different functional units on the microbial surface for enhanced bio-
catalytic activity, which couldﬁnd more applications in biocatalysis,
biosensing, and bioenergy.
Results and discussion
HFBI and PETase were functionally codisplayed on the surface of
yeast cells
In our codisplay system, hydrophobin HFBI and PETase should play
different roles based on their unique protein structures. HFBI is
thought to regulate the adsorption of yeast cells on the substrate PET.
PETase is responsible for degrading the substrate PET. Figure1as h o w s
the structures of the two functional proteins (PETase and HFBI) that
are codisplayed on the yeast surface. The fuchsia part in the surface of
HFBI represents a hydrophobic patch, which provides strong hydro-
phobic interactions and is how HFBI binds to various hydrophobic
surfaces
53. For PETase, the portion circled in the structure is the active
site, which is much broader than those of the other PET hydrolases;
this active site may explain why PETase can accommodate a large
substrate, such as PET, at moderate temperatures

schematic diagram of our codisplay system. The anchoring proteins
GCW51 and GCW61 were used to display PETase and HFBI on the yeast
surface, respectively. Aﬂexible linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was employed
to link the corresponding anchoring protein with PETase and HFBI
separately to prevent interference from occuring between each
anchoring protein and its displaying target
54. To explore the structural
difference between wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase, the
crystal structures of those two proteins were determined at 2.0 Å
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Table 1) and 1.5 Å
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1), respectively. We compared the
structure of wild-type PETase and linker-attached PETase and found
that the tertiary structures of these two proteins were quite similar,
with an overall RMSD of 0.352 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In the
structure of linker-attached PETase, we can only see a part of the linker
(6 amino acids) in the form of an irregular structure, indicating that the
(GGGGS)
2 linker is ﬂexible. This result is consistent with previous
ﬁndings that the GGGGS sequence is the most widely usedﬂexible
linker that can appropriately separate the functional domains55.T h e
catalytic centers of these two proteins were compared as well. As
shown in Fig.1d, the two active-site pockets were almost identical. The
above results revealed that the C-terminal fused linker did not induce
obvious structural changes in PETase. To validate our structuralﬁnd-
ings, we also performed molecular dynamics (MD) studies for the
codisplayed PETase and HFBI (Fig.1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). In the
simulation, the (GGGGS)
2 linker showed highﬂexibility, and no unique
structure was observed when the linker-attached PETase was displayed
by the yeast cell-wall protein GCW51. Moreover, thisﬂexible linker
separated PETase from GCW51 in space, meaning that the two func-
tional units did not affect each other.
Theoretically, our codisplay system should perform dual func-
tions that mimic the two-step process of PET degradation

function, which is derived from the HFBI part, is the ability to self-
assemble and facilitate the binding of yeast cells onto the hydrophobic
PET surface. The second function, which is inherited from PETase, is to
enzymatically degrade the highly crystallized substrate PET.

Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the Western blot (WB) results of both
PETase and HFBI at different induction times. Positive bands on the WB
ﬁlm indicated that both proteins were successfully expressed in the
recombinant yeast. To further demonstrate that HFBI and PETase were
successfully displayed on the yeast cell surface, an immunolocalization
assay was performed. Aﬂag tag was introduced to the N-terminus of
PETase as a response to the detection of anti-ﬂag antibodies. For the
displayed HFBI, a monoclonal antibody against HFBI was used in the
immunoﬂuorescence assay. As shown in Fig.1f, strong ﬂuorescent
signals of PETase and HFBI were observed on the yeast cell surfaces.
Additionally, noﬂuorescent signal was detected inside the cells. Fur-
thermore, WB analysis of different cell fractions (whole cells, cell walls,
and protoplasts) was performed to detect the cellular location of
linker-attached PETase. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, immune

signals of PETase mainly originated from the cell wall faction, apart
from the whole-cell fraction. No obvious signals were detected from
the protoplast fraction, regardless of the codisplay and display system.
All the above results conﬁrmed that both proteins were displayed on
the yeast cell surface, as expected. In addition, the intensity ofﬂuor-
escence was increased with increasing induction time, and the amount
of surface-displayed HFBI was greater than that of the surface-
displayed PETase when the induction time was less than 96 h
(Fig. 1g). These results indicated that induction time played an
important role in the levels of PETase and HFBI expression on the cell
surface
34.
After we obtained the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed
PETase and HFBI, we were eager to know whether the displayed PETase
maintained its enzymatic activity when it was codisplayed with
hydrophobin HFBI. Figure1h shows the degradation products released
by the recombinant yeast cell that codisplayed PETase and HFBI by
using hcPET as the substrate. The major product released by the dis-
played PETase was mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET),
and trace amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-
TPA (BHET) were detected at the same time. The ratio between the
liberated products of displayed PETase and that of the native PETase
was almost the same (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Together, these results
indicated that the displayed PETase was biologically active and
exhibited the same reaction mechanism as that of native PETase,
cleaving the polymer preferentially at similar positions
14,56.
The turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was calculated by
quantitatively analyzing the high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) results from Fig.1h. The standard curve of each released pro-
duct was calculated to accurately measure the amount of each product
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). A semiquantitative WB method was then
used to estimate how much PETase was displayed in the yeast cells. We
ﬁrst generated a standard curve of wild-type PETase by performing
grayscale analysis with the WB results (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).
Subsequently, yeast cells (at 48 h induction) were subjected to the
same WB analysis to detect the displayed PETase (Supplementary
Fig. 6c). According to the standard curve, 151.2 ng of PETase in a total
of 2 × 10
7 displayed yeast cells. For the Codisplay system, 2 × 107 cells
contained 35.2 ng of displayed PETase. As shown in Fig.1ia n dS u p -
plementary Fig. 7, the turnover rate of the recombinant yeast cell was
dramatically affected by the induction time and the ratio between HFBI
and PETase that was displayed on the cell surface. The ratio reached a
maximum value at the induction time of 48 h when the ratio between
HFBI and PETase displayed on the cell surface also reached its max-
imum. The above results revealed that the amount of HFBI on the cell
surface exhibited an obvious impact on the enzymatic activity of the
displayed PETase
57.
In our codisplay system, PETase is theoretically responsible for
degrading the substrate PET. To conﬁrm that surface-displayed HFBI
does not degrade PET as well, three surface display systems were
constructed, including the PETase (S160A)/HFBI codisplay system,
linker-GCW51 (removing PETase)/HFBI codisplay system and HFBI
single-display system, which are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a-c.
Enzymatic analysis of each surface display system revealed that none
of the displayed systems constructed above exhibited PET degradation
activity, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e), suggesting that
PETase performed an enzymatic function rather than hydrophobin on
the surface of yeast cells.
Surface-displayed HFBI can increase the adsorption of codis-
played cells on PET surfaces by improving their surface
hydrophobicity
In the above study, we conﬁrmed the surface expression of hydro-
phobin HFBI. Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) and water
contact angle (WCA) measurements were performed to verify whe-
ther the displayed HFBI could induce alterations in the surface
hydrophobicity of the recombinant yeast cells. MATH is a classical
technique for determining the surface hydrophobicity of various
cells
58,59. This method involves examining the adhesion of cells to
liquid hydrocarbons (e.g., n-butanol, p-xylene), as this adhesion is
directly associated with the hydrophobic surface properties of cells
(Fig. 2a)
60. As shown in Fig.2b, all yeast cells in the control group
(without induction) remained in the lower aqueous phase, indicating
that the cell surface properties were hydrophilic. As induction time
increased, the yeast cells that codisplayed PETase and HFBI gradually
moved into the upper oil phase, causing a concomitant loss in tur-
bidity throughout the lower aqueous phase. The relative hydro-
phobicity of the cell surface de ﬁned in the Methods section
continued to increase with the induction time and reached a max-
imum at 96 h (Fig.2c). To further demonstrate that the increase in
cell surface hydrophobicity was mainly due to the surfaced-displayed
HFBI, a MATH assay was conducted by using yeast cells that dis-
played only PETase. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows that yeast cells with
only PETase remained in the lower aqueous phase within the entire
induction time. Together, these results demonstrated that the dis-
played HFBI was responsible for the increase in the codisplayed cell
hydrophobicity.
WCA is another commonly used method to measure the surface
hydrophobicity of tested cells
61. After performing high-density cell
modiﬁcations, the WCA of the hcPETﬁlm can be determined by
examining the cell surface properties. As shown in Fig.2d, e, the hcPET
ﬁlm displayed a typical hydrophobic property (WCA is 85°). After
modiﬁcations were performed with yeast cells that codisplayed PETase
a n dH F B I( 4 8hi n d u c t i o n ) ,t h eW C Ao ft h eh c P E Tﬁlm slightly changed
from 85° to 73°, indicating the codisplayed yeast cells exhibited a
hydrophobic surface property. To clarify the contribution of the dis-
played HFBI to the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed yeast cells, the
WCA of yeast cells displaying only PETase was also determined. The
hydrophilic property (WCA is 37°) of the PETase-displayed cell con-
ﬁrmed that the HFBI part played an essential role in determining the
cell surface hydrophobicity. Together, these results veriﬁed that by
exposing its hydrophobic patch on the protein surface, the displayed
HFBI can indeed increase the hydrophobicity of the codisplayed
cells
43–46.
To determine whether the effect of displayed HFBI on cell
hydrophobicity can be transformed into an effect on the attachment of
yeast cells on the PET surface, we observed the adsorption of the

codisplay cells on the hcPET surface under different conditions. As
shown in Fig.2f, the codisplay cells covered almost all the surface areas
of hcPET. However, under the same binding condition for the control
sample-yeast cells that displayed only PETase, a sharply reduced
attachment to the PET surface was observed. The similar adsorption
differences between the codisplay cells and cells displaying only
PETase could also be observed when the same low concentration of

yeast cell numbers adsorbed on the hcPET surface for all tested sam-
ples (Supplementary Fig. 10). It was quite clear that the binding num-
bers of the HFBI-displaying yeast cells on the hcPET surface were
approximately twice that of the control group at each tested condition.
The adsorption differences between the codisplay cells and cells dis-
playing only PETase on the surface lcPET could also be observed,
regardless of the concentration of yeast cells in the binding assays
(Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). The number of HFBI-displaying yeast cells
adsorbed on the lcPET surface was approximately twice that of the
control group under each tested condition (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d).
We believe that the similar surface hydrophobicity of hcPET and lcPET
resulted in similar experimental results (Supplementary Fig. 12) by
WCA. To further verify the role of HFBI in the codisplay system, we
designed a codisplay system in which only hydrophobin was removed
and the other parts remained unchanged. Supplementary Fig. 13a
shows that both liker-GCW61 and PETase were successfully displayed
on the surface of yeast cells. Then, we tested the enzymatic degrada-
tion performance against hcPET and lcPET, and we found that the
codisplay system without hydrophobin exhibited a greatly reduced
degradation ability toward both hcPET and lcPET compared with that
of the normal codisplay system (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c). In addi-
tion, the adsorption capacity of this system on the PET substrate was
reduced to approximately half of the original value (Supplementary
Fig. 14). These results clearly revealed that the adhesive unit HFBI was
particularly important for the codisplay system to exhibit a high
degradation capacity to PET. Taken together, all these results con-
ﬁrmed that hydrophobin HFBI displayed on the yeast cell surface
introduced the extra binding capacity to the yeast cell on the PET
surface.
The codisplay system exhibited extraordinary enzymatic activ-
ity against PET
We then explored the optimal conditions of the codisplay cells for
hcPET hydrolysis and compared the results with those of puriﬁed
PETase. Figure3a and Supplementary Fig. 15a show that temperature
exhibited an obvious inﬂuence on the turnover rates for both the
codisplay cells and native PETase. The codisplay cells exhibited an
enhanced enzymatic activity compared with that of native PETase at
each tested temperature condition. The optimal reaction temperature
was 40 °C, similar to native PETase, indicating that the codisplay cells
remained in a heat-labile degradation system
14. Since high temperature
can promote the chain mobility of PET to accelerate its enzymatic
degradation, a heat stabilizing unit could be introduced into the cur-
rent surface display system to further improve its degradation efﬁ-
ciency in the future
18.F i g u r e3b and Supplementary Fig. 15b shows the
effect of pH on the turnover rates of the codisplay cells. The maximum
turnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9, similar to
native PETase. At other pH conditions, the codisplay cells exhibited
much higher turnover rates than those of native PETase. For example,
both yeast cells displaying only PETase (Supplementary Fig. 16) and
native PETase were almost inactive at pH 10. However, the codisplay
cells maintained more than 50% of their total enzyme activity, indi-
cating that their alkaline tolerance was signiﬁcantly improved. The
surface-displayed HFBI may contribute to this result since HFBI is very
stable at extreme pH conditions and can even resist protease degra-
dation in vitro
44,62–64. The increased tolerance of the codisplay cells to
alkaline environments can facilitate the PET pretreatment process65.
We then explored whether the cell number of codisplay cells
inﬂuenced their turnover rate. Figure3c shows that the turnover rate
for the codisplay cells was at its maximum (2146.5 × 10−5 sec−1)a n d
remained constant when the protein concentration was less than
1.3 nM. When the protein concentration exceeded 1.3 nM, the con-
version rates decreased rapidly. This result revealed that there the
displayed PETase on the yeast surface might be optimal, which cor-
responded to the maximum PET surface-reaching of the displayed
enzyme molecules. Additional displayed PETase molecules sterically
hindered the PET surface and appeared inactive, leading to a
decrease in the turnover rate of the codisplay cells. The native
PETase and the display cells faced similar situations as the codisplay
system, and the turnover rate reached maximum values (6.5 × 10
−5
and 227.9 × 10−5 sec−1) when the protein concentrations were 370 nM
and 11.3 nM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16c and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 17). Finally, we found that the maximum turnover rate of the
codisplay cells was strikingly 328.8-fold higher than that of native
PETase (Fig.3d).
Then, we performed both SEM and optical microscopy to observe
the morphological changes in the codisplay cell-treated hcPETﬁlm. At
the same time, we used native PETase-treatedﬁlms as controls. As
shown in Fig.3e, there was almost no surface erosion on the PETase-
treated hcPETﬁlm, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of native
PETase against hcPET was rather low. In contrast, apparent cracks and
erosion on the PET surface were observed by SEM when the yeast cells
that codisplayed HFBI and PETase were applied to hcPET. Microscopic
observation of cross-sections of the PETﬁlms was also performed to
further evaluate the degradation results of our codisplay system. As
shown in Fig.3f-g and Supplementary Fig. 18, almost no change in the
thickness of the PETase-treated hcPETﬁlm was observed. A small but
obvious reduction in thickness (~3.2%) was observed when our codis-
played yeast cells degraded the hcPETﬁlm.
To further verify the functionality of the codisplay system, the
enzymatic activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst toward a commercially
available lcPET (PET-GF, crystallinity of 6.3%) was also measured.
Considering that the degradation substrate was changed, we opti-
mized the degradation conditions of both the codisplay cells and
puriﬁed PETase for lcPET. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 19 and
Supplementary Fig. 20, several reaction conditions, including tem-
perature, pH, and cell number, caused obvious effects on the turnover
rates of the codisplay cells and puriﬁed PETase. The optimal reaction
temperature remained at 40 °C (Supplementary Fig. 19a), and the
maximum turnover rate of the codisplay cells was achieved at pH 9,
similar to native PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19b). These results were
similar to those obtained by using hcPET as the degradation substrate.

(2909.3 × 10
−2 sec−1) when the normalized PETase concentration was
0.65 nM. In contrast, the turnover rate of puriﬁed lcPET reached a
maximum value (5.6 × 10−2 sec−1) when the protein concentration was
181.4 nM (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Accordingly, the maximum turn-
over rate of the codisplay cells against lcPET was 519.5-fold higher than
that of the puriﬁed PETase (Supplementary Fig. 19d).
Supplementary Fig. 21 shows the morphological changes in the
codisplay cell-treated lcPETﬁlm, as observed by SEM and optical
microscopy. Obvious erosion spots were observed on the surface of
lcPET, which is consistent with the results of hcPET degradation,
indicating that the results were statistically signiﬁcant. In addition, it
can be seen from the SEM results that the PETﬁlms degraded by the
codisplay system were full of round pits with a size of ~5 microns,
which was basically consistent with the size of yeast cells. These results
revealed that yeast cells adsorbed on the PET surface and then exerted
enzyme activity, as seen in the adsorption experiment (Supplementary
Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11). The puriﬁed PETase contained small
corrosion spots locally and was very small. This result indicated that
the codisplay system could efﬁciently degrade lcPET and hcPET.
In addition, we tested the crystallinity of lcPET and hcPET before
and after degradation at different temperatures using the codisplay
system, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 22. For lcPET, it can be seen
that the crystallinity increases with increasing conversion level, indi-
cating that PETase degraded amorphous PET in the codisplay system.
However, the crystallinity of the PETﬁlm treated with the system
without enzyme at different temperatures did not change obviously
compared with that of the control group, indicating that the

temperature (range of 20–50 °C) exhibited little effect on the crystal-
linity of PET. The change in crystallinity observed in the experiment
was mainly caused by enzyme digestion. The same results can also be
observed in hcPET samples, except that the crystallinity decreases with
increasing PET degradation, which suggested that the codisplay sys-
tem exhibited no selectivity for PET hydrolysis. At the same time, the
change in temperature did not affect the crystallinity of the hcPETﬁlm,
indicating that the change in crystallinity of PET was also caused by
PETase.
Finally, we compared the turnover rate based on the total pro-
ducts of MHET, TPA, and BHET for the puriﬁed PETase, yeast cells
that displayed only PETase, and those with codisplay at the optimal
condition using lcPET (Supplementary Fig. 23a) and hcPET (Supple-
mentary Fig. 23b) as substrates. The conversion levels of hcPET and
lcPET within 18 h at 30 °C were ~3.0% (depolymerization rate of 3.27
mg
products h−1 mgenzyme
−1) and 55% (depolymerization rate of 178.15
mgproducts h−1 mgenzyme
−1), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 24).
The codisplay whole-cell biocatalyst system is robust and
efﬁcient
It is expected that the codisplay cells will be used as whole-cell bio-
catalysts on an industrial scale; therefore, several properties related
to industrial applications of the codisplay cells were evaluated,
including thermal stability, reusability, chemical or solvent stability,
storage conditions, and long-term enzymatic activity. Figure 4a
shows that the relative turnover rate of the codisplay cells remained
at 100% when the cells were placed at 30 °C for 7 days, indicating that
the enzyme activity was almost unchanged during this incubation
time. Free PETase lost 40% of its original hydrolytic activity after
1 day of incubation at 30 °C, and its enzyme activity was completely
lost on theﬁfth day. These results revealed that the codisplay cells
exhibited considerably higher thermostability
66,67. This is one intrin-
sic advantage of the surface display system68,69. Sanna et al. reported
that native HFBI did not degrade at 30 °C for 18 h62. Therefore, the
excellent thermostability of HFBI might play a role in the thermo-
stability of the codisplay cells. Then, the reusability of the codisplay
cells was investigated.
As shown in Fig.4b, the codisplay cells retained 85% of the ori-
ginal turnover rate after three rounds of use and 50% after seven
cycles. There are two possible reasons for the decline in the turnover
rate. Theﬁrst reason is that cells are inevitably lost in the recycling
process. The second reason is that the degradation products might
occupy the catalytic pocket of the displayed PETase and inhibit its
activities to some extent
70. Next, we determined whether the pre-
sence of organic solvents or detergents would affect the turnover
rate of codisplay cells due to the pretreatment process of PET, which
often involves these chemicals. Figure4c shows that the turnover
rate toward hcPET retained 98, 82, and 72% when the codisplay cells
were incubated in the tested solutions that contained 0.1% Triton X-
100, 10% methanol, and 10% ethanol, respectively. Compared with
the yeast cells that displayed PETase, the codisplay cells showed a
higher turnover rate at each test chemical solution
34. For example,
the turnover rate of yeast cells that displayed PETase remained at just
50% in 0.1% Triton X-100 solution
34. The chemical stability of the
codisplay cells is beneﬁcial to the PET pretreatment processes, such
as cleaning71. It is well known that hydrophobin can maintain its
functional activity under extreme conditions42. Hence, the chemical
stability of hydrophobin HFBI may be related to the stability of the
codisplay cells in the chemical solutions. Finally, the turnover rate of
the whole-cell biocatalyst was evaluated before and after lyophiliza-
tion, which is a dehydration process that facilitates the storage and
transport of codisplay cells
72. Supplementary Fig. 25 shows that the
turnover rate of the codisplay cells toward PET remained nearly 100%
after freeze-drying, suggesting that the whole-cell biocatalyst
retained almost total enzymatic activity after the dehydration
process. Therefore, lyophilization is considered a storage option for
the future use of whole-cell biocatalysts.
Next, we applied the codisplay cells to degrade commercial PET
bottles. Figure4d shows that the whole-cell biocatalyst can efﬁciently
degrade different highly crystallized PET bottles. According to a pre-
vious method
13, we calculated the conversion level of the codisplay
cells against the highly crystallized PET bottles used in our study. As
s h o w ni nT a b l e1, the conversion levels were 3.1, 3.1, and 2.8% for
Nestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi PET bottles, respectively. In Yoshida’s
paper, the conversion level of native PETase against hcPET was
~0.0097%
14. Compared to native PETase, the codisplay cells exhibited
much higher degradation efﬁciency in the highly crystallized PET
bottles. All were consistent with the conversion levels for hcPET and
lcPET. The conversion level of the codisplay system was 3 and 55%
toward hcPET and lcPET, respectively, which was consistent with pre-
vious microscopic observations. We also summarized and calculated
the conversion levels of several reported PETase mutants using the
same procedure in the Methods section (Table1). Clearly, the codis-
play system showed the best conversion level under 18 h for both high-
and low-crystallinity PET. Finally, to evaluate the long-term function-
ality of the designed whole-cell biocatalyst, we used the codisplay
system to degrade hcPET for 10 days. As shown in Fig.4e, f, the total
products and relative conversion levels of hcPET in both the codisplay
system and the display system increased with time and reached a
maximum around the ninth day, which was 10.9 and 1.2%, respectively.
However, the degradation activity of wild-type PETase for hcPET was
very low, and the conversion level was only 0.003%. These results
showed that by establishing the codisplay system, the stability of
PETase increases.
Although the conversion level of codisplay cells against the
commercial bottles was the highest ever reported for any degradation
system using PETase to our knowledge, there is still much room for
improvement. For example, we can screen and test more adhesive
units to further improve the binding of the yeast cell onto the PET
surface. By doing so, we hope that the codisplay system can be applied
in the large-scale biological recycling of PET in the future.
Molecular insights into the two-step degradation of PET by the
codisplay system
To explore how membrane-anchored HFBI/PETase engaged PET
chains and how these interactions facilitated the subsequent cleavage
of PET, all-atom MD simulations were performed. MD simulation has
been adopted by several researchers to investigate the interactions
between wild-type or mutant PETase and their substrate PET in soluble
states
11,73–77. In the preequilibrated system (0 ns), randomly distributed
4PET did not interact with the active center of PETase or the hydro-
phobic region of HFBI (Fig.5a, Supplementary Fig. 26, and Supple-
mentary Movies 1, 2). Over time, 4PET gradually aggregated near the
hydrophobic amino acids of HFBI at ~40–50 ns. At ~60–70 ns, 4PET
completely attached to the hydrophobic patch of HFBI, which occur-
red mainly through the interaction of hydrophobic residues, and
remained mostly bound for the rest of the trajectory. During this
period, 4PET began to gather near the active center of PETase; even-
tually, a number of 4PET molecules were gathered at ~100 ns. Calcu-
lation of the distances between 4PET and the other two proteins
agreed with the possible role of HFBI in the local enrichment of PETs
(Supplementary Fig. 27). From the simulated trajectories, we postu-
lated that our codisplay system completed PET degradation through
two-step processes involving adsorption and hydrolysis, wherein the
hydrophobin HFBI favorably binds to the PET chains and grabs the
chains ﬁrmly (Fig.5b); then, PETase interacts with PET and performs a
hydrolysis function (Fig.5c).
Next, to delineate the interaction between PETase-linker-
GCW51 and hcPET and to elucidate whether PETase-linker-GCW51
follows a conformational selection or induced-ﬁt mechanism, we

performed induced ﬁt molecular docking (IFD) analysis of
PETase-linker-GCW51, in which a PET-tetramer represented the
polymer substrate (4PET)

poses were subjected to analys is with respect to the spatial
arrangement of the residues of the catalytic triad and the con-
formation of the reactive part of the oligomer substrate 73.W e
found the best-predicted docking pose while taking the pro-
ductivity of the catalytic triad into account, as shown in Fig.5c.
The reacting carbonyl carbon of the substrate was bound with the
scissile ethylene glycol moiety in the canonical gauche con-
formation (Ψ
gauche) in a twisted chain conformation, which was
consistent with how that wild-type PETase binds to 4PET73.
In this study, we developed a codisplay system to mimic the
natural two-step gradation process of PET by a whole-cell bioca-
talyst. Among the codisplay systems, the hydrophobin HFBI dis-
played on the yeast cell surface was proposed to function as an
adhesive unit to enhance the attachment of codisplay cells to the
PET surface, which would achieve the aim of efﬁcient degradation
of hcPET by the whole-cell biocatalyst. Our data showed that the
displayed HFBI causes the codisplay cells to exhibit a hydro-
phobic surface property. A twofold increase in the binding
numbers of the hydrophobin-producing yeast to hydrophobic
PET was observed under the optimal catalytic conditions.
Hydrophobic interactions between yeast cells and their substrate
PET may play a major role in attachment. An enzymatic assay
conﬁrmed that the enzymatic activity of the codisplay cells was
~328.8 times higher than that of the puriﬁed PETase. Our results
not only provide an efﬁcient strategy for efﬁciently biodegrading
hcPET but also demonstrate the plasticity of the surface display
system. By introducing different functional modules into the
surface display system, its performance can be greatly improved.
In the future, more functional units, such as MHETase, that can
hydrolyze MHET to PET reagen ts can be introduced into the
whole-cell biocatalyst system to further enhance its performance.

were synthesized by the BGI Group (China). All primers used for plasmid

the recombinant plasmids pPICZαA/hfbI-gcw61 and pPICZαA/lin-

To display PETase and HFBI on the cell surface, the recombinant
plasmids pPIC9/petase-gcw51 were then linearized withStu I, and
pPICZαA/hfbI-gcw61 and pPICZαA/linker-gcw61 were then linearized
with Sac I. Then, the linearized products were subsequently trans-
formed into the host strain GS115 by electroporation.
Finally, the genome of the positive transformants selected from
YPD plates containing 100μg/mL Zeocin as the selective marker was
used as a template, and PCR was carried out using the target gene
primers and AOX primers to screen three kinds of true positive
transformants, GS115/PETase-HFBI, GS115/PETase, and GS115/
PETase-ΔHFBI.
Western blot and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy analysis
The puriﬁed Flag-tagged PETase protein was used to prepare protein
standard curves. A nanodrop was used to accurately measure the
PETase concentration. Proteins (10, 50, 200, and 300 ng) were accu-
rately obtained for SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P
transfer membranes (0.45μM pore size, Sigma-Aldrich) under 100 V
for 1 h for use in immunoblot analyses. The antibodies used for Wes-
tern blotting were primary rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (ABclonal, cata-
log# AE092, 1:2000), primary mouse HFBI antibody (storage in our
laboratory, 1:1000), primary mouse anti-His antibody (SUNGENE BIO-
TECH, catalog# LK8001, 1:1000), goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (SUN-
GENE BIOTECH, catalog# LK2001, 1:2000), and goat anti-mouse
antibody (SUNGENE BIOTECH, catalog# LK2003, 1:2000). All serial
Western blot data were representative of at least three biological
experiments. The chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc) was added for imaging detection (GelDoc XR+, Bio-Rad, USA).
Then, ImageJ was used to quantify the grayscale of the lane and draw
the standard curve.
To determine the soluble and nonsoluble ratio of PETase
expressed in the yeast strain, we performed Western blot analysis on
whole cells, cell walls, and protoplasts. Before the samples were pre-
pared for SDS-PAGE, the OD

collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Then, the grayscale of the lane
was used to quantify and calculate the proportion of protein in each
cell component.
To quantify the relationship between the number of cells and
the concentration of PETase in the codisplay system and display
system, we used 2 × 10
7 yeast cells after 48 h of induction for SDS-
PAGE electrophoresis and quantitative analysis by Western blot-
ting. According to the standard curve, for the display system, the
PETase expression amount of 2 × 10 7 cells was equivalent to
151.2 ng. For the Codisplay system, the PETase expression amount
of 2 × 10
7 cells was equivalent to 35.2 ng. PET degradation
experiments in this study were carried out by taking corre-
sponding multiples of 2 × 10
7 yeast cells, and the concentration of
PETase was calculated according to the proportion.
The antibodies used for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy analy-
sis were FITC goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Abclonal, catalog# AS001,
1:200) and rhodamine (TRITC) goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Abclonal,
catalog# AS040, 1:200). To conﬁrm the expression and localization of
PETase-GCW51 and HFBI-GCW61 fusion proteins on the yeast cell
surface, the yeast cells were visualized on a confocal microscope
(UltraView Vox, PerkinElmer, USA).

D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The puriﬁcation proce-
dures are described as follows:
Bacteria expressing proteins were harvested and resuspended in a
lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, and 10%
glycerol and lysed by high-pressure homogenization. After cen-
trifugation (16,000×g, 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was loaded
onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare). The
column was washed using lysis buffer supplemented with 30 mM
imidazole and eluted using lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mM
imidazole. Finally, the protein was puriﬁed by gel-ﬁltration chroma-
tography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) using a buffer
containing 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl.
Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination
All crystals were grown by the microbatch-underoil method unless
otherwise speciﬁed. PETase was crystallized at 16 °C by mixing 1μLo f
protein (15 mg/mL) with 1μL of crystallization buffer containing 0.2 M
calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.1 M HEPES sodium pH 7.5, 28% v/v
polyethylene glycol 400. The crystal of PETase-linker was grown at
16 °C from a mixture of 1μL protein (15 mg/mL) and 1μL crystallization
buffer containing 10% w/v PEG 8000, 100 mM MES/sodium hydroxide
(pH 6.0) and 200 mM zinc acetate. The crystals were cryoprotected by
Parabar 10312 (previously known as paratone oil). X-ray diffraction
data were collected on beamline BL19U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility at 100 K and at a wavelength of 0.97861 Å. Data
integration and scaling were performed using HKL3000. The wild-type
PETase and PETase-linker structures were all solved by molecular
replacement using the structure ofIsPETase (PDB ID: 5XJH)
15 as a
search model through the PHASER program from the CCP4 package.
Model building and reﬁnement were performed using PHENIX (version
1.14) and COOT (version 0.8.9).
Enzyme activity assay for PET
To evaluate the hydrolytic activity of PETase and the codisplayed
recombinantP. pastoris, the hcPETﬁlm (Good Fellow, crystallinity, 45%,
thickness, 0.175 mm, diameter, 6 mm) and the lcPETﬁlm (Goodfellow

6 mm) were used as the substrates for degradation assays with the
puriﬁed PETase enzyme and the displayed system. Before the reaction,
the PETﬁlm was soaked separately in 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM Na
2CO3,
and distilled water (each was performed at 50 °C for 30 min at 550 rpm),
and then air-dried for the reaction. Subsequently, the PETﬁlm was
placed into a tube with 300μL buffer containing 50 mM glycine-NaOH
( p H9 . 0 )f o r1 8 ha t3 0 ° Cw i t h3 7 0 n Mp u r iﬁed enzyme and corre-
sponding yeast cells. To optimize the induction time, puriﬁed PETase-
and GS115/PETase-HFBI-displayed yeast cells were induced for 0, 24, 48,
72, and 96 h for the enzyme activity assay. After removing the enzyme-
treated PETﬁlm from the reaction mixture,t h ee n z y m er e a c t i o nw a s
terminated by heating at 85 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture samples
were then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min. The supernatant of each
sample was further analyzed by high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy (HPLC) to quantify the PET monomers released from PET
depolymerization. To compare the PET hydrolytic activity of the dis-
played system with WT PETase across a range of pH values (2.0–10.0) at
20 and 50 °C, a similar experimental setup was used.
Then, the enzymatic activity of the codisplayed PETase was
determined by calculating the turnover rate of the codisplayed PETase
in each experiment. The turnover rate was calculated by normalizing
the amount (moles) of the total products (MHET, BHET, TPA) gener-
ated in each experiment to the amount (moles) of PETase present in
each experiment, and then the resultant ratio was further divided by
the enzymatic degradation time (18 × 3600 s). All the following enzy-
matic activities of codisplayed or native PETase were determined in the
same way.
For the long-term enzyme activity reaction, the PETﬁlm was
p l a c e di n t oat u b ew i t h3 0 0μL buffer containing 50 mM glycine-NaOH
(pH 9.0) at 30 °C with 370 nM enzyme. Then, samples were taken every
24 h for 10 consecutive days, and the amount of the three products was
detected by HPLC to calculate the conversion level. A similar experi-
mental setup was used for the displayed system.

HPLC analysis of the degradation product of PET
HPLC was performed on a Waters e2695 equipped with a HyPURITY
C18 (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, No 22105-254630) column
(4.6 × 250 mm). The mobile phase was methanol/18 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 2.5) at aﬂow rate of 0.5 mL min−1,a n dt h ee fﬂuent was
monitored at a wavelength of 240 nm. The typical elution conditions
were as follows: 0 to 30 min, 25% (v/v) methanol, and 30 to 50 min,
25–100% methanol linear gradient. The total peak areas of MHET, TPA,
and BHET were used to calculate the amount of products in each PET
hydrolysis reaction.
Standard MHET was obtained from the complete hydrolysis of
BHET, which was purchased from Sigma. The detailed process was as
follows. Four millimolar BHET was incubated with 50 nM PETase in
40 mM Na
2HPO4-HCl (pH 7.0), 80 mM NaCl, and 20% (v/v) DMSO at
30 °C. After the complete hydrolysis of BHET to MHET was conﬁrmed
by HPLC, the protein was removed from the reaction mixture with

Amicon Ultra 10 kDa (Merck Millipore), resulting in a 4 mM MHET
solution.
Then, MHET, TPA, and BHET of different concentrations were
used to run HPLC, and the standard curves of the three were drawn
according to the relationship between peak area and sample loading.
Cell surface hydrophobicity assay
The hydrophobicity of yeast cell surfaces was determined by using
microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH), which was modiﬁed
from a previous protocol55. The induction time was 0, 24, 48, 72, and
96 h, and the yeast cell suspension was washed twice with PUM buffer
(containing 150 mM phosphate, potassium, and magnesium, pH 7.1).
Then, the absorbance of the cells in the PUM buffer was adjusted to
OD
600 = 4 and deﬁned as A1. The cell suspension (0.75 mL) was added
to a 2 mL glass bottle, then 0.75 mL ofn-butanol was added, and the
cap was tightly closed. After 30 s of an eddy, the mixture was left for
3 min to complete the two-phase separation. The absorbance of the
water phase at 600 nm was determined as A
2. The hydrophobicity is
given as a percentage (%) = (A1 − A2)/A1.
Contact angle measurements
Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with Milli-Q
water, andﬁnally resuspended in pure ethanol at a concentration of 108
cells mL−1. A small volume of the cell suspension (250μL) was spread
over the PETﬁlm. After drying theﬁrst layer of cells, two more layers
were added, completely covering the PETﬁlm. Contact angles were
measured on agar plates covered with cells. The measurements were
carried out in a standard contact angle apparatus (KSV Instruments
Ltd, CAM 200). The contact angles were determined automatically

Adsorption assay of cells on PET
Each PETﬁlm (diameter, 6 mm) was placed in 2 × 106,4×1 06,2× 1 07,
4×1 07, and 1.2 × 108 mL−1 cell suspensions and shaken at 30 °C, and the
PET ﬁlm was removed after 18 h for microscopic examination (BX51,
Olympus, Japan).
Optimization of the codisplay system
To optimize the pH, the reactions were conducted in 50 mM NaH2PO4-
NaOH (pH 4.0–5.0), 50 mM Na2HPO4-HCl (pH 6.0–8.0), or 50 mM
glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0–10). To optimize the temperature, the reactions
were conducted at 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C.
Standardizing the cell number to protein concentration
To quantify the displayed PETase concentration, we used Western
blotting for quantitative analysis. First, we used PETase for Western
blot grayscale analysis and plotted a standard curve, as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6a, b. Subsequently, we used 2 × 10
7 yeast cells
after 48 h of induction for SDS‒PAGE electrophoresis and quantitative
analysis by Western blot, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6c. Accord-
ing to the standard curve, for the display system, the PETase expres-
sion amount of 2 × 10
7 cells was equivalent to 151.2 ng. For the
Codisplay system, the PETase expression amount of 2 × 107 cells was
equivalent to 35.2 ng. PET degradation experiments in the manuscript
were carried out by taking corresponding multiples of 2 × 10
7 yeast
cells, and the concentration of PETase was calculated according to the
proportion.
Optimization of protein concentration for the PET hydrolysis
reaction
The PETase protein concentrations were 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 70, and
100 μgm L−1. The MHET quality of the PETase reaction with PET at
10 μgm L−1 was deﬁned as 100%, and the relative enzyme activity was
calculated. The GS115/PETase-HFBI cell concentration was standar-
dized to 2 × 10
6,4×1 06,2×1 07,4×1 07,1 . 2×1 08,2×1 08,2 . 8×1 08,a n d
4×1 08 mL−1. All reactions were performed in 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH
9.0) at 30 °C for 18 h.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Each PETﬁlm (diameter, 6 mm) was examined by SEM, both before and
after degradation treatment, underthe same conditions. PET samples
were rinsed with 1% SDS, then rinsed with Milli-Q water and ethanol,
sputter-coated with Au, and mounted on aluminum stubs using carbon
tape. SEM imaging was performed using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG
instrument under a low vacuum operating with a gaseous solid-state
detector. Imaging was performed with a beam-accelerating voltage
of 5 keV.
Observing the thickness change of PETﬁlm before and after
degradation
To measure the change in PETﬁlm thickness, the hydrolyzed PETﬁlm
after each incubation was transferred into a 1.5 mL tube with buffer
(1 mL, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) containing 5% w/v SDS to remove the
adsorbed protein and cells and was washed with Milli-Q water. The
washed ﬁlms were cut in half to measure the cross-section and set
vertically on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a V10
ocular and a V10 objective. The cross-section was observed in the
brightﬁeld. The thickness was calculated from the number of pixels in
the image based on the scale bar.
Reusability and stability assays of the whole-cell biocatalyst
For the thermostability of yeast, the residual yeast activity was mea-
sured after incubation at 30 °C for 1–7 days in 50 mM glycine-NaOH
buffer (pH 9.0). The yeast was recycled after centrifugation at 3500×g
for 5 min. For the chemical/solvent condition’s stability of yeast, the
residual yeast activity was measured after incubation in 50 mM glycine-
NaOH (pH 9.0) supplemented with methanol (ﬁnal concentration, 10%
v/v), ethanol (ﬁnal concentration, 10% v/v), DMSO (ﬁnal concentration,
10% v/v), Tween (ﬁnal concentration, 0.1% v/v), and Triton X-100 (ﬁnal
concentration, 0.1% v/v) for 18 h at 30 °C. Then, the PET reaction was
started after washing 3 times with 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) at
3500×g for 5 min.
Effect of freeze-drying on PETﬁlm hydrolysis
For the freeze-dried yeast, the freeze-dried yeast activity was measured
after incubation at 4 °C overnight in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH
9.0). The OD
600 value was measured to ensure that the cell count was
the same as that before freeze-drying.
Enzyme assays for commercial PET bottles
GS115/PETase-HFBI cells (induced for 48 h, total cell number is
6.2 × 10
9) were incubated with 6 mm diameter hcPET cut out from
different commercial PET bottles (brands: Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and
Pepsi) in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) for 18 h at 30 °C.
Growth curve measurement
The transformant GS115/PETase-HFBI was inoculated into BMGY
medium at 30 °C to an OD600 of 2 to 6. The culture was centrifuged at
3500×g for 5 min and resuspended in BMMY medium to an OD600 of
1. To induce the fusion protein for expression, cells were incubated at
30 °C with 100% methanol every 24 h to aﬁnal concentration of 1%.
Pichia pastorisGS115 was used as a negative control. The OD
600 was
measured every 24 h from 0 to 216 h, and the growth curve
was drawn.
Termination reaction
All PET hydrolysis reactions were terminated by diluting the
aqueous solution with 18 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) containing
10% (v/v) DMSO, followed by heat treatment (85 °C, 10 min). All BHET
hydrolysis reactions were terminated by diluting the aqueous solution

Nature Communications|         (2022) 13:7138 13
with 16 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) containing 20% (v/v) DMSO
followed by heat treatment (80 °C, 10 min). The supernatant obtained
by centrifugation (13,500×g, 10 min) was analyzed by HPLC.
Calculation of the LOD and recovery of HPLC analysis
According to Supplementary Fig. 29, we determined that the LOD of
HPLC analysis was 0.029 nmol. The recovery rate was ~100% in our
study. After the PET hydrolysis reaction was terminated, there were
three locations for the major degradation product MHET. Theﬁrst
location was the supernatant of the reaction buffer, the second was the
surface of the PETﬁlm where MHET might adsorb, and the last was the
inner surface of the test tube where MHET might adsorb as well.
Therefore, we measured MHET samples from those three locations.
The ﬁrst sample was obtained by centrifugation. The second and third
samples were obtained by washing the PET ﬁlm and test tube,
respectively. After the HPLC measurements, we found that nearly 100%
of MHET was in the supernatant of the reaction buffer (Supplementary
Fig. 16). This result was consistent with the result from Yoshida’ss t u d y ,
which only measured MHET from the supernatant of the reaction
buffer.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
Differential scanning calorimetry was performed using a DSC214
polyma (NETZSCH, Germany) using≈6–8 mg of a dry PET sample. A
heating rate of 10 °C min
−1 was applied for the temperature range
from −20 to 300 °C. The glass transition temperature (Tg), cold
crystallization temperature (Tcc), and melting point (Tm) of various
PET samples were obtained using theﬁrst heating scan. The initial

AlphaFold modeling
In this study, AlphaFold2 was used to predict PETase-linker-GCW51 and
HFBI-linker-GCW61. The prediction of complexes was run twice with
different random seeds, and ten models were obtained. Beginning with
a visual inspection, four models were selected to check the protein
structural quality for the side chain conformations using the prime
module of Schrödinger 2021-3. Eventually, the one complex with the
highest quality score was selected for further optimization with sub-
sequent MD simulations.
Molecular dynamics simulations
The all-atom MD simulations were performed by Gromacs 2019.6 with
CHARMM36 forceﬁeld84,85. The structural models of PETase and GCW51
fusion protein, HFBI and GCW61 fusion protein were generated by
AlphaFold2
86. The 4PET polymer chain and the corresponding para-
meterﬁles (.top and.itp) were generated following previously published
procedures87. For the modeling of solution-state PETase, a predocked
PETase/4PET or PETase-GCW51/4PET complex was solvated with TIP3P
waters and ions (0.15 M NaCl, total of 164,478 atoms). The Nose‒Hoover
thermostat (303.15 K) and Parrinello-Rahman isotropic NPT ensembles
were adopted with h-bond LINCS constraints. Three independent tra-
jectories were performed (250 ns each) after a short 10 ns equilibrium
simulation. To model the membrane-bound PETase, PETase-GCW51 and
HFBI-GCW61 were anchored to a bilayer of lipids through glycosyl-
phosphatidylinositol modiﬁcations at protein N-termini. A typical
composition of lipids included 66 molecules of ergosterol, 32 molecules
of POPA, 64 molecules of POPC, 60 molecules of POPE, and 96 mole-
cules of POPI to mimic the yeast membrane environment and maintain
the bilayer stability (15 nm × 15 nm in the xy dimension)
88,89. To mimic
PET plastic in a possible solvent-swelling state, 20 individual chains of
4PET were added to the system at random positions along with 6 nm
thickness of TIP3P waters and ions (0.15 M NaCl), the resulting system
contained a total of 343086 atoms. After equilibrium was reached,
simulations were performed using three independent trajectories for
50 ns. Representative conformations were extracted from each trajec-
tory bygmx clusterfor further analysis. Quantitative analysis was also
implemented usinggmx rms, rmsf, Rgtools.
Molecular docking
Induced ﬁt docking (IFD) experimentswere performed using Schrö-
dinger 2021-3, employing the Maestro graphical interface on PETase-
Linker-GCW51 generated by AlphaFold2. A PET-tetramer capped at both
ends as ethyl esters was prepared and minimized in Maestro using the
LigPrep module with the OPLS3e forceﬁeld
90.T h eP E T a s e - L i n k e r -
GCW51 structure was prepared in Maestro employing the Protein Pre-
paration Wizard
91. Protonation states were assigned according to the
pKa values and a pH of 7 with PropKa. Finally, the structures were
reﬁned through restrained minimization using the OPLS3e forceﬁeld to
within an RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal mol
−1 Å−1. Finally, a Glide redocking
step was performed using the extra precision Grid-Based Ligand
Docking with Energetics (Glide XP) algorithm. In Glide XP docking, a
better correlation between bestposes and scores was obtained
73.
