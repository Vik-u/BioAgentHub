ABSTRACT: The development of efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles is an important goal
for the chemical industry. In particular, substituted chiral piperidines are prominent targets due to their prevalence in medicinally
relevant compounds and their precursors. A potential biocatalytic approach to the synthesis of this privileged scaffold would be the
asymmetric dearomatization of readily assembled activated pyridines. However, nature is yet to yield a suitable biocatalyst specifically
for this reaction. Here, by combining chemical synthesis and biocatalysis, we present a general chemo-enzymatic approach for the
asymmetric dearomatization of activated pyridines for the preparation of substituted piperidines with precise stereochemistry. The
key step involves a stereoselective one-pot amine oxidase/ene imine reductase cascade to convert N-substituted tetrahydropyridines
to stereo-defined 3- and 3,4-substituted piperidines. This chemo-enzymatic approach has proved useful for key transformations in
the syntheses of antipsychotic drugs Preclamol and OSU-6162, as well as for the preparation of two important intermediates in
synthetic routes of the ovarian cancer monotherapeutic Niraparib.

INTRODUCTION
The ubiquity of saturated nitrogen heterocycles (N-hetero-
cycles) in natural products and pharmaceuticals continues to
drive the development of innovative strategies for their efficient
synthesis.
1,2
In particular, chiral piperidines are much sought
after structures due to their prevalence as scaffolds in a range of
bioactive molecules including market-approved active pharma-
ceutical ingredients (APIs).
3
Nature provides highly efficient
biocatalysts for the biosynthesis of N-heterocycles,
4,5
offering
high enantio- and regio-selectivity under benign conditions.
These biocatalysts have previously enabled the development of
one-pot cascade reactions to access stereo-enriched 2-, 2,6-,
and 2,3-substituted piperidines.
6−10
However, the translation
of these methods to the corresponding stereoenriched 3-
substituted and 3,4-substituted scaffolds, the core of many
important therapeutic compounds (Figure 1A), remains
challenging due to difficulties in stereoselectivity control
combined with limited availability of suitable starting materials.
Asymmetric chemical synthetic approaches for the prepara-
tion of 3-substituted and 3,4-disubstituted piperidines include
those based on metalation/cross-coupling,

and transition-metal-
catalyzed dearomatization of pyridines.
17−21
However, limi-
tations are associated with all of these approaches, including
high reaction temperatures, sensitivity to moisture, lack of
availability of starting materials, and the use of expensive
noncommercial chiral ligands.
11,22
Among reported methods,
the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of pyridines is
achieved by quaternization-activation of the pyridine nitrogen,
permitting access to mild reduction methods to chiral
piperidines (Figure 1B, left).
17,23−26
Whilst nature has yielded
pyridine synthases to prepare pyridines,
27
an effective
biocatalyst for their dearomatization is yet to be discovered.
With this in mind, we sought to combine mild chemical

reduction of pyridiniums to tetrahydropyridines (THPs) with
the exquisite stereoselectivity of a biocatalytic cascade to
reduce the final C�C bond as an efficient strategy for
asymmetric dearomatization of activated 3- and 3,4-substituted
pyridines (Figure 1C). Biocatalysts with broad substrate scope
for the reduction of C�C bonds require the conjugation of
the alkene to an electron-withdrawing group. Recently, C�C
bonds conjugated to C�N bonds have been shown to
undergo full reduction to amines through the combination of
ene-reductases (EREDs) and imine reductases (IREDs),
6
as
well as the newly discovered ene imine reductase (EneIR-
EDs).
28
We reasoned that biocatalytic oxidation, using an
amine oxidase
(AmOx), of the THP in situ would generate the
corresponding dihydropyridiniums (DHPs), generating an
activated C�C bond conjugated to the C�N bond, which
could then be reduced with these biocatalysts to generate a
cascade to the desired 3- and 3,4-substituted piperidines. This
cascade complements a previous amine oxidase AmOx-IRED
deracemization processes in which only amine oxidation and
C�N bond reduction take place.
29,30
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A series of substituted N-alkyl THPs 1b-21b was prepared in
good yields (50−90%) from activated pyridines (1a-21a) using
NaBH
4
as previously reported.
31
Initially, we explored the
conversion of THPs to piperidines using AmOxs in
combination with EREDs or EneIREDs (see Supporting
Information 2.1.; Figures S1−S5 for the complete list of
THPs screened). For the first step, we tested AmOx variants
that have been shown to be effective biocatalysts for the
oxidation of N-alkyl THPs.
32,33
The 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine
oxidase (6-HDNO) variant, E350L/E352D,
34
was found to be
effective, with a broad substrate scope, including oxidation of
1b, a precursor to Preclamol. We next screened for activity for
the second step, namely, reduction of the C�C bond of the
α,β-unsaturated iminium ion. Whereas the panel of EREDs
displayed no activity, the EneIRED from an unidentified
Pseudomonas sp. (EneIRED-01),
28
in combination with 6-
HDNO, was effective at reducing a number of THPs and could
be used to prepare piperidine (R)-1c in good yield and with
excellent enantioselectivity (see Supporting Information 2.1.,
Table S1; entry 1−3, ≥42% yield, 96% ee).
Next, we set out to identify further EneIREDs that could
also generate enantioenriched 3-substituted piperidines. By
screening the recently reported metagenomic IRED collec-
tion,
35
in combination with the 6-HDNO variant, we were able
to quickly identify biocatalysts capable of generating either
enantiomer of piperidine (R/S)-1c from THP 1b (see
Supporting Information 2.2., Table S2). From this screen, we
organized these EneIREDs into two groups: Series A (red:
EneIREDs 01−04) that gave piperidine (R)-1c (Table S2 up
to >99% ee) and Series B (blue: EneIREDs 05−09) that
generated the enantiocomplementary piperidine (S)-1c (Table
S2, up to 96% ee).
With effective EneIREDs for the preparation of both
enantiomeric series, we probed the substrate scope of the 6-
HDNO-EneIRED cascade (Table 1). Enzymes in Series A and
B accepted a variety of aryl substituents at the C-3-position of
the THP scaffold, affording products 1c-7c in high yields,
conversion, and enantioselectivity. Five-membered heterocy-
clic 3-substituents such as furan 8c and thiophene 9c were also

well tolerated (≥62% yield, ≥86% ee). Sterically demanding
substrates, for example, containing a 2-naphthyl substituent
10b, were also tolerated producing (R)-and (S)-10c in
excellent yield and stereoselectivity (73% yield, >99% conv.,

≥94% ee). Additionally, a variety of N-alkyl substituents were
accepted forming the piperidine products 1c-12c in good to
excellent yields. Of these, N-allyl 3c-4c and N-propargyl 12c
piperidines provide useful synthetic handles that can be easily
removed or further functionalized.
More hindered 3,4-disubstitituted THPs could also be
reduced using the cascade, resulting in the formation of the
substrate-dependent cis or trans isomer. These included
substrates in which both substituents were simple alkyl (3,4-
dimethyl) 17b or part of a fused bi-cyclic ring system
(octahydroisoquinoline) 18b. We then probed the tolerance
for a combination of alkyl and aryl substituents at C-3 and C-4.
3-Phenyl-4-methyl disubstituted compounds 19b and 20b
provided the corresponding piperidines (A)-19c and (A)-20c
in excellent yields and diastereoselectivity (cis major; >96:4 dr;
≥87% yield). The system also tolerated the isomeric 3-methyl-
4-phenyl disubstituted THP 21c. In addition to the inversion
of stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position (Series A vs
Series B), we also discovered some EneIREDs in Series B that
provided an inverted diastereomeric configuration of the 3,4-
disubstitituted piperidines 17c-20c compared to Series A.
To probe the mechanism of the 6-HDNO-EneIRED
cascade, the conversion of THP 6b to piperidine 6c was
investigated by in situ
19
F NMR reaction monitoring (Figure
2A). After <5 min, formation of piperidine 6c was apparent
and after 60 min, the THP 6b was completely consumed. In
the absence of the EneIRED, 6-HDNO catalyzed the
previously reported aromatization of THP 6b to the
corresponding pyridinium ion 6a (see Supporting Information
2.3., Figure S6, >99% conversion after 24 h).
33
As expected, no
direct reduction of the THP 6b to piperidine 6c was observed
in the absence of 6-HDNO, suggesting that a transiently
generated dihydropyridinium (DHP) is the substrate for the
EneIRED reduction. Using the cascade with THP-10b, we
were able to isolate the enamine 10e before full conversion to
the piperidine 10c (see Supporting Information 5.1., 63%
yield), which strongly suggested the participation of this
compound in the reaction pathway. Accordingly, enamine 10e
was converted to piperidine 10c using EneIRED-01 alone, in
excellent yield and high enantioselectivity, equivalent to the full
cascade with THP-10b (Figure 2B, top; 88% yield, 94% ee).
Deuterium labeling experiments were also implemented to
further elucidate the mechanism of the EneIRED enamine
reduction step. Carrying out the reduction of enamine 10e
using EneIRED-01, in the presence of GDH and D -glucose-1-
d
1
to generate deuterated NAD(P)D in situ, C-2-mono-
deuterated 10c-d
1
was formed (80% deuterium incorporation,
82% yield). This suggests that the enamine intermediate 10e
may undergo protonation to the iminium before NAD(P)H
hydride delivery (Figure 2B, bottom and see Supporting
Information 5.2.).
A proposed mechanism for the 6-HDNO-EneIRED cascade
is outlined in Figure 2C. For illustrative purposes, we have
depicted the transformation of THP-3b to (S)-3c as this
product is used in the subsequent synthesis of the key
intermediate for Niraparib described below. Initially, 6-HDNO
oxidation of THP-3b results in the activation of the THP C�
C bond for EneIRED-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate
reduction of DHP-3d at the expense of NADPH to generate
enamine 3e (Cycle 1; step iii). This intermediate 3e is
expected to be in equilibrium with chiral iminium 3f via a
nonselective protonation in solution, which has been
extensively documented.
9,36,37
Depending on the EneIRED
employed (Series A or B), the kinetic selective reduction of
one enantiomer of chiral iminium 3f affords the enantioen-
riched piperidine 3c as the final product via reduction with a
second molecule NADPH (Cycle 2; step vii). In situ
epimerization of the enantiomer in 3f via enamine 3e enables
a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) to occur to generate
piperidine (S)-3c mediated by the EneIRED.
Predominantly, EneIREDs in Series A yielded (R)-
piperidines whilst enzymes in Series B such as EneIRED-07
yielded the (S)-product. In order to gain insight into the mode
of substrate binding in the active site, we determined the
structure of EneIRED-07 from Micromonospora sp. Rc5 to a
resolution of 2.55 Å in complex with NADP
+
using X-ray
crystallography. Crystals were obtained in the P2
1

2 space
group and featured six molecules in the asymmetric unit,
representing three dimers. EneIRED-07 displays the canonical
fold observed for IREDs,
38,39
with two monomers associating
to form two active sites between the N-terminal Rossmann
domain of one subunit and the C-terminal helical bundle of its
neighbor (Figure 2D). Analysis using the DALI server
40
suggested that the IRED with the most closely related structure
was the IRED from Streptosporangium roseum (PDB 5OCM)
with an rmsd of 1.0 Å over 288 Cα atoms. Following building
and refinement of the protein atoms, clear omit density was
observed in each active site corresponding to the cofactor
NADP
+
. The iminium intermediate (S)-3f, the preferred
enantiomer for EneIRED-07 imine reduction, was modeled
into the active site using Autodock Vina (Figure 2E).
41
The
model suggests that the allyl group of (S)-3f is bound within a
hydrophobic pocket formed by methionine residues M125,
M183, and M214 at the rear of the active site as shown; the
para-bromo-phenyl group projects toward the front of the
active site bordered by L180, W184, and the NADP
+
cofactor.
This ligand conformation places the electrophilic carbon
approximately 3.6 Å from the NADP
+
pyridinium ring C4
atom, from which hydride is transferred. Modeling of the (R)-
enantiomer of 3f places the allyl group at the base of the active
site with less favorable interactions with hydrophilic residues
Y225 and D238 (see Supporting Information 7.4., Figure S13).
The absolute configuration of 6c-10c was verified using
VCD (Vibrational Circular Dichroism), a technique available
for the determination of stereochemical configuration of chiral
molecules in the solution phase.
42−45
This was accomplished
by the comparison of experimental infrared (IR) and VCD
spectra to density functional theory (DFT)-calculated spectra
of a specific configuration. Because this series of molecules was
of low molecular weight with a limited number of low energy
conformations (fewer than 10 in each case), four different
DFT methods were completed for each compound. We tested
two functionals (B3LYP and B3PW91) each with two basis
sets (6-31G(d) and cc-pVTZ) to see which would have the
best statistical results in each case.
46
As expected, all five
piperidine methods yielded consistent results for each
enantiomer, with the best results coming from cc-pVTZ/
B3PW91 for piperidines 6c and 9c, cc-pVTZ/B3LYP for
piperidines 7c and 8c, and 6-31G(d)/B3PW91 for piperidine
10c. Neighborhood similarity values for IR and VCD, as well
as confidence level (≥93%) were obtained using BioTools
(Jupiter, Fl) CompareVOA software (see Supporting In-
formation 4.3., and 12.).
47,48
Because of the similarity of the
chiral core, the VCD experimental spectra were very similar for
all tested compounds. Future work could therefore forego the
calculations in order to streamline the process.

Finally, we sought to apply the chemo-enzymatic dearoma-
tization of activated pyridines to several target bioactive
molecules (Figure 3). First, we targeted the antipsychotic drug
Preclamol. At preparative scale (1 mmol), THP-1b was
converted to both (R)-(+)- and (S)-(−)-preclamol 22, using
EneIRED-01 and EneIRED-05, respectively. Both enantiomers
were prepared in four steps from 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)pyridine
and were obtained in ≥50% overall yield and with 96% ee
(Figure 3A and see Supporting Information 5.1.). Next, we
carried out the three-step syntheses of both enantiomers of
OSU6162 2c, using EneIRED-02 and EneIRED-06, and these
were both accomplished in ≥36% overall yield and ≥92% ee
(Figure 3B), respectively.
To further demonstrate the application of the cascade, we
synthesized the two intermediates 23 and 24 en route to
Niraparib (Figure 3C), the first poly ADP ribose polymerase
(PARP) inhibitor to be approved as a first-line monother-
apeutic for the maintenance treatment of patients with
advanced ovarian cancer.
49
For route I, we showed that
commercially available 3-(4-bromophenyl)pyridine could be
efficiently converted to piperidine (S)-3c in just three steps
and 61% overall yield (99% ee). This was followed by
deallylation and N-Boc-protection to yield (S)-23 in 64% yield,
a key intermediate in Merck’s second-generation synthesis.
50
Alternatively, in route II, by starting from commercially
available 4-(pyridin-3-yl)aniline, we converted pyridinium salt
4a to (S)-24 in 29% overall yield and with 93% ee, a key
intermediate in Merck’s first-generation synthesis.
51
The
general applicability of the method was also showcased by
the preparation of the corresponding (R)-enantiomers of both
23 and 24 in good yields and high enantioselectivity (see
Supporting Information 5.1.).
In summary, we report the development of a versatile and
highly efficient chemo-enzymatic dearomatization of activated
pyridines for the preparation of stereo-enriched 3- and 3,4-
disubstituted piperidines. The 6-HDNO-catalyzed oxidation of
readily accessible THPs facilitates EneIRED-catalyzed con-
jugate reduction and iminium reduction to yield a broad range
of chiral piperidines. The short syntheses of both enantiomers
of Preclamol and OSU6162, as well as chiral precursors to
Niraparib, highlight the flexibility and utility of the method
presented, emphasizing the advantages of combining chemical
synthesis with biocatalysis for developing new catalytic
methods for the preparation of important chiral compounds.
Furthermore, the increasing ability to systematically screen
large panels of biocatalysts against new targets leads to the
rapid identification of enzymes with applications in asymmetric
synthesis.
