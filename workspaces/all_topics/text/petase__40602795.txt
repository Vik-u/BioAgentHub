ABSTRACT: Due to its low cost of manufacturing, poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET, a polyester plastic) has been the most widely used plastic material for food
packaging. However, PET is nonbiodegradable. It can take years to degrade when it is
discarded into the environment. In recent years, plastic pollution has received much
attention and has become a major environmental issue. In this study, we engineered
yeast surfaces to display two PET-degrading enzymes (PETase and MHETase) to
degrade PET plastics. The enzymes displayed on the yeast surface were characterized
by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The reaction conditions to degrade
PET plastics using the engineered yeasts were optimal at pH 9 and 30 °C. In addition,
the engineered yeasts showed great stability and reusability to degrade PET films.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the engineered yeasts as whole-cell catalysts can
be used to degrade drinking water bottles into value-added products. This study
provides a novel whole-cell biocatalyst using engineered yeasts to degrade plastic
waste, offering a new strategy to solve plastic pollution and recycling challenges.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the last century, the plastic industry has grown significantly.
The total amount of plastic used exceeds 300 million tons every
year, with an increase of 5% annually.
1,2
However, less than half
of these plastics are reused or recycled. As a result, tons of plastic
are discarded into nature. In the environment, plastic can take
years to degrade.
3
Without full degradation, microplastics,
defined as plastic pieces with a size of 1−5 mm, have been found
everywhere around the world, including inside plants and
humans.
4−6
With an increasing demand for plastic items, plastic
pollution is becoming a bigger problem year after year. Some
strategies (e.g., prevention measures, cleanup activities, and
awareness instruments) have been used to address this issue. For
example, the ban on plastic bags has been successful in reducing
the use of plastic shopping bags in supermarkets and shopping
malls. Unfortunately, it is still not feasible to remove all
discarded plastics from the environment and fix the existing
widespread plastic pollution, especially the most widely used
plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
For chemical recycling, PET plastics are broken down to their
monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)
that can be refined or remanufactured into high-value products,
including gallic acid, pyrogallol, catechol, muconic acid, vanillic
acid, and glycolic acid.
7
Due to the utilization of high pressure
and temperature, hazardous organic solvents, and catalysts,
chemical methods have several disadvantages, including high
cost, complicated processing steps, and poor compatibility with
downstream purification processes.
8,9
Biodegradation of PET
plastics using microorganisms or enzymes has emerged as an
effective alternative approach to address these issues.
10,11
To
perform environmentally friendly and green depolymerization of
PET waste, researchers have discovered PET-degrading
enzymes and improved their catalytic activities to green
depolymerize PET waste. To date, about 50 PET-degrading
enzymes (including lipases, cutinases, carboxylesterases, and
esterases) from bacteria and fungi have been reported to degrade
PET plastics.
12−14
Although these enzymes can degrade PET
waste, there is an urgent need to develop more practical
technologies to recycle plastic waste.
In 2016, Yoshida et al. discovered a bacterium (Ideonella
sakaiensis) that can secrete new types of PET-degrading
enzymes to efficiently degrade and assimilate PET as a carbon
and energy source, including PET hydrolase (PETase) and
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) hydrolase
(MHETase).
15
Since then, the two PET-degrading enzymes
have been widely studied as ideal enzymes to completely

degrade PET waste. To date, numerous efforts have been made
to improve the hydrolysis activities of PETase and MHETase to
degrade PET waste. For example, chemical modification can
improve enzymatic activity by providing PETase with a stable
environment.
16
Synthetic biology allows the fusion of multiple
glutamic acid (Glu, E) and lysine (Lys, K) on the enzyme
surfaces to protect the stability of PETase.
17,18
In addition,
PETase has been displayed on the surface of bacterial cells to
increase the tolerance of pH and thermal variations.
19−21
Although PETase and MHETase have gained significant
attention as effective tools for reducing PET waste, the transition
from theoretical to practical application faces significant
challenges.
Cell surface display has become a highly promising strategy
for expressing and engineering proteins inside and outside of the
cell. Engineering cells to display a specific protein of interest on
their cell surface, termed surface display systems, is attractive for
many applications in microbiology and molecular biology.
22
This strategy not only simplifies the synthesis process of the
enzyme of interest, but also avoids the complex and costly
processes of enzyme separation and purification that are
generally necessary in alternative procedures.
23,24
Cell surface
display systems were initially developed for filamentous phage
by fusing peptides on the surface of capsid proteins without
affecting the phage’s ability to infect bacteria.
25
However, it is
not feasible to incorporate large polypeptides and proteins on
phage surfaces. Alternatively, bacterial surfaces can be used to
express large-sized proteins.
26,27
Compared to bacterial systems,
yeast offers structural robustness and several advantages for
whole-cell biocatalysis, including higher resistance to fluctua-
tions in pH and temperature, simplified genetic engineering, and
greater stability across various bioprocessing environments.
28
Yeast cells can also be produced economically in large quantities
and hold Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status, further
enhancing their suitability for environmental and industrial
applications, particularly in scalable enzyme display and practical
PET degradation.
29
In this study, we developed engineered yeasts with the surface
display of PET-degrading enzymes as whole-cell biocatalysts to
degrade PET plastics. Using molecular engineering tools, we
displayed PETase and MHETase on yeast surfaces (Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae EBY100) that were confirmed by using
confocal microscopy and a flow cytometer. In addition, we
identified optimal reaction conditions (pH and temperature) of
the yeast-displayed PETase and MHETase to improve the PET
degradation efficiency. Furthermore, our developed engineered
yeasts displaying PET-degrading enzymes were applied to
commercial postconsumer drinking water bottles. The engi-
neered whole-cell biocatalysts demonstrated a significant
breakdown rate and hold promise for resolving the current
crisis of PET pollution, potentially providing a financially
feasible and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical
recycling.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Materials and Chemicals. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol
(EG), glycine, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). Mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (MHET) was purchased from Advanced Chem-
Blocks, Inc. (Hayward, CA). Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix,
NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix, OneTaq 2X
Master Mix with Standard Buffer, Monarch Plasmid Miniprep
Kit, Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit, and other reagents used
in cloning work were purchased from New England BioLabs
(Ipswich, MA). Commercial amorphous PET film (transparent,
0.25 mm thickness, catalog number ES30-FM-000145) was
obtained from Goodfellow Corporation (Pittsburgh, PA).
DyLight 488 Anti-HA tag antibodies and other chemicals were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).
2.2. Strains, Plasmids, and Media. The S. cerevisiae
EBY100 (S. cerevisiae EBY100) was kindly provided by R. Clay
Wright at Virginia Tech. The pCTcon2 plasmid (# 41843) was
purchased from Addgene (Watertown, MA). Table S1 contains
comprehensive information about the strains and plasmids used
in this study. The primers (Table S2) were designed for Gibson
Assembly and synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
The yeast-codon-optimized genes for PETase and MHETase
are synthesized by Twist Bioscience (San Francisco, CA) and
are available in Table S3.
Culture conditions: Escherichia coli (E. coli) Top 10 were
cultured at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin if needed. S. cerevisiae EBY100 was cultured at 30 °C
in YPAD media. Engineered yeasts were selected in SDCAA
plates. The proteins displayed on yeast surfaces were induced in
SGCAA medium with galactose as the inducer.
2.3. Construction and Expression of PETase and
MHETase on Yeast Surfaces. The codon-optimized genes
for PETase and MHETase were amplified using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). The PCR products were purified using
the DNA Gel Extraction Kit and assembled into pCTcon2
backbone using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix.
The plasmids of pCTcon2-PETase and pCTcon2-MHETase
were transformed into E. coli Top 10 competent cells for
amplification.
30
The inserts were then confirmed using Sanger
sequencing. The correct plasmids containing the genes coded
for PETase and MHETase were then transformed into S.
cerevisiae EBY100 competent cells according to a previously
reported method with minor modifications.
31
The positive
colonies on the SDCAA selective plates were confirmed by using
yeast colony PCR.
To express PETase and MHETase on the yeast surface, a fresh
colony was inoculated into SDCAA medium (5 mL) and
incubated at 30 °C overnight. The expression of PETase and
MHETase was induced by inoculating the overnight culture into
the SGCAA medium (OD
600
= 0.5) and incubated at 30 °C for
48 h. Engineered yeast with the pCTcon2 plasmid was used as a
positive control. After incubation, the cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min. They were then washed and
resuspended in glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 9) to obtain
EY-pCTcon2, EY-PETase, and EY-MHETase. The wild-type
yeasts as negative controls were cultured in YPAD media.
2.4. Characterization of PETase and MHETase on Yeast
Surfaces. Anti-HA Tag antibodies were used to confirm the
expression of PETase and MHETase on yeast surfaces following
the procedure reported by Luo et al. with minor modifications.
32
Wild-type, EY-pCTcon2, EY-PETase, and EY-MHETase
(around 1 × 10
7
yeast cells) were centrifuged at 3000g for 2
min and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 100
μL, pH 7.4, with 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Anti-HA Tag
antibodies (1 μL) were added and gently rotated at room
temperature for 1 h in the dark. Following the incubation, yeast
cells were rinsed 3 times using PBS and subsequently
resuspended in PBS (50 μL). The fluorescence immunostaining
was characterized using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope

(Nikon, Melville, NY) and Attune NxT Acoustic Focusing
Cytometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
2.5. Degradation of PET Plastics Using Whole-Cell
Biocatalysts. The PET films were first cut into circular forms
with a diameter of 7 mm by using a perforating machine (hole
punch). Each film was treated in solutions (1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, SDS), 20% ethanol, and distilled water for 1 h to
guarantee complete cleaning. The films were then dried at 50 °C
to remove any residues. Before degradation, PET films were
preincubated in glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 9, 0.025%
SDS, and 10% DMSO) for at least 1 h to increase the film
hydrophilicity. The pH and temperature for the degradation
conditions were optimized. For pH, PET degradation was
performed in PBS (pH 6, 7, and 8) and glycine-NaOH buffer
(pH 9 and 10). Four temperatures (20, 30, 40, and 50 °C) were
used to optimize the temperature.
For the PET degradation, engineered yeasts (4 × 107 yeast
cells) were suspended in glycine-NaOH buffer (800 μL). The
pretreated PET films were added to the engineered yeast and
incubated at 30 or 40 °C for 7 days. After the incubation, the
reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 100%
methanol (MeOH), followed by heating at 85 °C for 10 min.
After centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min, the degrading
products (BHET, MHET, and TPA) in the supernatant were
analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). A Prominence LC-20 HPLC System (Shimadzu,
Durham, NC) equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18
column (95Å, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) was employed to analyze
BHET, MHET, and TPA.
13,21,33
The mobile phase A consists of
0.1% formic acid, and the mobile B is composed of acetonitrile
(v/v = 8:2) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL·min
−1
. The injection volume
was set to 5 μL. For the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image, the treated PET films underwent a cleaning procedure
involving a sequential wash with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol, and
distilled water. After air-drying, the films were imaged by using
SEM.
To degrade postconsumer drinking water bottles, we selected
two types of postconsumer PET bottles: the Great Value
Purified Drinking Water bottle and the Deer Park Spring Water
bottle. Four different parts of the bottles were cut into circles
with a diameter of 7 mm by using a hole punch, including the
shoulder, body, transition to base, and base.
2.6. Stability and Reusability of Whole-Cell Biocata-
lysts to Degrade PET Films. To evaluate the stability and
reusability of the whole-cell biocatalysts, we conducted a series
of successive degradation cycles on PET films using engineered
yeasts. For each cycle, the engineered yeasts were incubated with
pretreated PET films in glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mm, pH 9,
0.025% SDS, and 10% DMSO) at 30 °C for 3 days. After each
degradation cycle, the engineered yeasts were separated from
the reaction solution through centrifugation at 3000g for 5 min.
They were subsequently rinsed with a glycine-NaOH buffer
solution (50 mM, pH 9) to thoroughly remove any remaining
substrate.
To obtain free PETase and MHETase fusions, the engineered
yeasts (4 × 107 yeast cells) were subjected to centrifugation at
3000g for 5 min. Subsequently, they were washed and
resuspended in glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, 800 μL, pH 9,
0.025% SDS, and 10% DMSO) supplemented with DTT (100
μM). The disulfide reduction reactions were gently shaken at 37
°C for 2 h to ensure the detachment of PETase and MHETase
fusions from the cell walls. Afterward, the supernatant, obtained
through centrifugation at 4000g for 10 min at 4 °C, was utilized
for the degradation of PET films.

2.7. Quantitative Determination of PET Degradation
Products. Standard curves for quantitative analysis were
established using known concentrations of terephthalic acid
(TPA), mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). Each standard
solution was injected in triplicate into the HPLC system to
generate calibration curves by plotting peak area (in
milliabsorbance units·seconds, mAU·s) against analyte concen-
tration (μM). Linear regression analysis was performed to

were conducted with three replicates, and the results are
presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analyses
were carried out by using GraphPad Prism.
2.8. Determination of PET Crystallinity. The PET
crystallinity of different parts from PET drinking water bottles
was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC,
TA-Q2000, New Castle, DE) equipped with a liquid nitrogen
cooling system. The predried PET samples (around 5−6 mg)
were placed in a Tzero aluminum pan, which was then sealed
with a matched aluminum lid. The DSC analysis was performed
by heating the sample from 35 to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C·min

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Degradation of PET Plastics Using Engineered
Yeasts as Whole-Cell Biocatalysts. Among several types of
plastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most popular
plastic produced globally with an annual production of
approximately 359 million tons in 2020.
38,39
PET is a linear
thermoplastic polyester made by a condensation reaction
between two petroleum-derived small chemicals of terephthalic
acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).
40,41
Although PETase
and MHETase have been discovered to degrade PET, poor
enzymatic activity limits their practical applications.
In this study, we genetically engineered yeast surfaces to
display PETase and MHETase, which were then employed to
degrade postconsumer drinking water bottles into high-value
monomers, including TPA and EG (Figure 1a). Yeast cells were
specifically selected as the host for surface display due to their
distinct advantages as biocatalysts. Unlike bacterial systems,
yeast possesses a mechanically robust cell wall that enhances
structural stability and enables repeated use under harsh
reaction conditions.
42
This protective barrier allows yeast to
tolerate a wide range of environmental stresses. Moreover, yeast
offers efficient and flexible genetic engineering tools, making it
well suited for constructing strains that express complex enzyme
systems.
43
We expressed PETase and MHETase on the surface of
separate yeast strains using the pCTCon2 plasmid encoding an
Aga2 fusion of PETase or MHETase.
44
As shown in Figure 1b, S.
cerevisiae EBY100 expresses Aga1 proteins (Aga1p) on the
whole-cell surface, serving as anchors to link the Aga2 protein
(Aga2p) coded from an expression plasmid (pCTcon2) through
two disulfide bridges. The covalent bonds result in the tethering
of PETase and MHETase on the yeast cell surface, generating
EY-PETase and EY-MHETase.
The engineered yeasts displaying PETase and MHETase can
break down PET plastics by breaking ester linkages, and the final
products include TPA and EG. As shown in Figure 1c, EY-
PETase can efficiently convert PET polymers into mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), TPA, and a minor
amount of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and
sequentially cleave BHET into MHET and EG.
45
The resulting
MHET can be further degraded by EY-MHETase into TPA and
EG.
45
Both PETase and MHETase act synergistically for the
complete hydrolysis of PET plastics. Therefore, EY-PETase and
EY-MHETase can work synergistically to recycle PET plastics
into the smallest high-value units (TPA and EG).
3.2. Construction of PET-Degrading Enzyme Expres-
sion Plasmids. Due to the high surface expression and
eukaryotic protein engineering mechanisms, yeast display is
superior to the traditional bacterial or phage display platforms.
46
In addition, yeast can offer advantages in the low cost of

plasmids (i. wild-type and ii. pCTcon2) and plastic-degrading enzyme expression plasmids (iii. pPETase and iv. pMHETase), and their corresponding

production as well as high stability during storage. Although
different yeast strains and yeast surface proteins have been used
to display heterologous proteins, yeast Aga2p of the mating
protein a-agglutinin is the most commonly used.
47
As shown in
Figure 2a, S. cerevisiae EBY100 expresses Aga1p on the whole-
cell surface, serving as the anchor to link Aga2p through two
disulfide bridges. The covalent binding results in the tethering of
PETase and MHETase to the yeast cell surface. The gene
encoding Aga1p is stably integrated into the yeast chromosome,
while the gene encoding Aga2p is cloned into a yeast display
plasmid vector (pCTcon2). The expression of Aga2p is
controlled by a galactose-inducible promoter. To quantify and
characterize the expressed PETase and MHETase on the yeast
cell surface, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag is typically fused in-frame
with the Aga2p coding sequence prior to either PETase or
MHETase.
In previously reported studies, PETase and MHETase have
shown the capability to degrade PET waste.
15,48−52
To degrade
plastics, we engineered yeast (S. cerevisiae EBY100) to display
PETase and MHETase on yeast cell surfaces. As shown in Figure
2b, genes coding for these two PET-degrading enzymes (870 bp
for PETase and 1809 bp for MHETase) were yeast-codon-
optimized and then cloned into the pCTcon2 backbone in-
frame after the Aga2p coding sequence and a hemagglutinin
(HA) epitope tag, respectively. These plasmids were amplified
in bacteria and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The resulting
PETase and MHETase expression plasmids were transformed
into EBY100 competent cells and transformants were selected
using SDCAA media (excluding tryptophan), generating EY-
PETase and EY-MHETase.
31
Yeast colony PCR was used to
confirm the transformation of these plasmids. Wild-type yeast
and the engineered yeast with the pCTcon2 plasmid (named
EY-pCTcon2) were used as negative and positive controls. The
expected bands for the protein fusions (976 bp for Aga2p-HA-
pCTcon2, 1660 bp for Aga2p-HA-PETase, and 2599 bp for
Aga2p-HA-MHETase) were observed, and there was no band
for the wild-type yeast (Figure 2c). All of these results indicated
that we constructed the PET-degrading enzyme expression
plasmids and transformed them into yeast cells.
3.3. Characterization of the PETase and MHETase
Expression on Yeast Surfaces. Generally, there are
approximately 5 × 104 copies of Aga1p on each yeast cell
surface, but the covalent binding of Aga2p may be lower
depending on the stability and solubility of PETase and
MHETase.
53
To quantify and characterize the expressed ligands
on the yeast cell surface, an HA tag is typically fused in-frame
with the Aga2p coding sequence before PETase and MHETase.
Employing confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we
specifically targeted the HA tag with fluorescently labeled anti-
HA antibodies, allowing for the precise and comprehensive
visualization of PETase and MHETase expression on yeast
surfaces. Wild-type yeast and EY-pCTcon2 were, respectively,
utilized as negative and positive controls.
To express PET-degrading enzymes on yeast surfaces,
SGCAA medium was used, in which galactose induced the
expression of Aga2p-HA-PETase/MHETase fusions. The
expressed PET-degrading enzymes on the yeast surfaces were
confirmed by labeling HA tags with fluorescently labeled
(DyLight 488) anti-HA antibodies (Figure 3a). Compared to
the wild-type yeast, all engineered yeasts (EY-pCTcon2, EY-
PETase, and EY-MHETase) were stained green, indicating that
the Aga2p-HA-pCTcon2/PETase/MHETase fusions success-
fully attached to the yeast surfaces (Figure 3b). Afterward, the
fluorescence intensities on the yeast surfaces were analyzed
using a flow cytometer. As shown in Figure 3c, the differences in
fluorescence signal between wild-type yeast and engineered
yeasts can be clearly observed, in which engineered yeasts have
strong fluorescence intensities. All of these results indicated that
PET-degrading enzymes (PETase and MHETase) have been
successfully expressed on yeast surfaces.

excitation at 488 nm.

3.4. Optimization of the PET Degradation Conditions
Using Whole-Cell Biocatalysts. Enzymatic reactions are
extremely sensitive to the conditions under which they take
place. In particular, pH and temperature play crucial roles in
influencing the efficiency and rate of enzymatic activities. To
maximize the efficiency of PET degradation, we identified the
Figure 4. (a, b) Degradation of PET films occurred at different pH values (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) and different temperatures (20, 30, 40, and 50 °C).
Following hydrophilization, the film solutions were inoculated with different yeasts (no yeast control, wild-type, EY-pCTcon2, EY-PETase, EY-
MHETase, and EY-PETase + EY-MHETase) at equal cell density.
Figure 5. (a, b) Degradation of PET films using engineered yeasts was carried out for 7 days at 30 and 40 °C, including control, wild-type, EY-
pCTcon2, EY-PETase, EY-MHETase, and EY-PETase + EY-MHETase. (c) The corresponding SEM images of the degraded PET films were obtained
using engineered yeasts.

optimal pH and temperature conditions for enzymatic activities
of engineered yeasts that display PET-degrading enzymes. The
hydrophilization of the PET films also plays an important role in
PET degradation. Following a previously reported method, the
PET films were pretreated by soaking in 1% SDS, 20% ethanol,
and distilled water, respectively. And then they were
preincubated in glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 9, 0.025%
SDS, and 10% DMSO) for at least 1 h.
To optimize the pH, PET plastics were degraded at a range of
pH values (from 6 to 10) using various engineered yeasts,
including wild-type, EY-pCTcon2, EY-PETase, EY-MHETase,
and EY-PETase + EY-MHETase. The reaction solution without
any yeasts was used as a control. After incubating for 7 days, the
resulting products (BHET, MHET, and TPA) were analyzed
using HPLC. As shown in Figure 4a, a significant amount of
degradation products was observed in groups containing EY-
PETase (including EY-PETase and EY-PETase + EY-
MHETase), whereas minimal degradation was detected in
other groups. For the group of EY-PETase + EY-MHETase, less
MHET was observed, as the EY-MHETase further degraded
MHET into TPA and EG. The optimal pH for the degradation
of plastics was 9. The optimal conditions observed for PET
degradation at pH 9 align well with previous reports, indicating
enhanced catalytic performance of PET-degrading enzymes
such as PETase and MHETase under mildly alkaline conditions
and moderate temperatures. At pH 9, catalytic residues within
PETase and MHETase are likely in their optimal ionization
states, facilitating efficient ester bond hydrolysis. This optimal
ionization enhances the substrate binding affinity and catalytic
turnover rates. Additionally, under slightly alkaline conditions,
the PET surface tends to become more amorphous and
hydrophilic, significantly improving enzyme accessibility to the
ester linkages and thus enhancing degradation efficiency.

Afterward, we investigated the effects of temperature on PET
degradation, including 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C (Figure 4b).
Similarly, we observed that the concentration of degraded
products increased from 20 to 40 °C, and declined at 50 °C. The
degradation efficiency showed no significant difference between
30 and 40 °C for either EY-PETase or EY-PETase + EY-
MHETase.
3.5. Degradation of PET Films Using Whole-Cell
Biocatalysts. Next, we applied the engineered yeasts to
degrade PET films under optimal conditions. The pretreated
PET films were incubated with the engineered yeasts at a pH of 9
and a temperature of 30 or 40 °C for 7 days. We collected
samples daily throughout the reaction period and analyzed the
degradation products (BHET, MHET, and TPA) using HPLC.
As shown in Figure 5a,b, the EY-PETase and EY-PETase + EY-
MHETase group generated more degradation products than the
controls, indicating that the PETase displayed on yeast surfaces
can degrade PET films. Compared to EY-PETase, less MHET
was detected in the EY-PETase + EY-MHETase group, as
MHET was further degraded into TPA and EG by EY-
MHETase. In addition, the degradation products gradually
increased as the number of days increased at 30 °C. However,
there was a decrease in enzyme activity by the fourth day at 40
°C. Most products were generated in the first 2 days. This could
be explained by the PETase and MHETase losing their activity
with the increase of the reaction time, and the PETase and
MHETase were more stable at 30 °C. The identified optimal
temperature of 30 °C represents a compromise between
catalytic activity and enzyme stability. While elevated temper-
atures generally increase reaction kinetics, they may simulta-
neously promote enzyme denaturation or negatively impact the
stability of the expression system. Our experimental results
indicate that EY-PETase and EY-MHETase maintain stable
enzymatic activity at 30 °C, effectively degrading PET without
notable thermal inactivation.

The morphologies of PET films after degradation were
characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Scratch-like linear structures were observed for the PET films
when incubated with EY-PETase and EY-PETase + EY-

MHETase, not in other groups (Figure 5c). This phenomenon
may be the result of the processive degradation of aligned
polymer fibers by EY-PETase in the surface region of the PET
films. The initial cleavage resulted in the formation of shorter
polymer fragments, which, in turn, increased the number of sites
that could be attacked by EY-PETase and EY-MHETase. The
results suggested that the engineered yeasts have the potential to
degrade postconsumer PET plastics.
3.6. Reusability and Stability Assays of the Whole-Cell
Biocatalysts. Enzyme immobilization is a strategy to improve
the stability and efficiency of an enzyme. To test whether the
enzymatic activities of PETase and MHETase displayed on yeast
surfaces can be improved, we compared the performance of the
PET plastic degradation between immobilized PETase and
MHETase against free ones. As shown in Figure 6a, the free
enzymes were obtained using dithiothreitol (DTT), which can
break the disulfide bond between Aga1p and Aga2p. The same
amount of PETase and MHETase from free enzymes or
engineered yeasts was applied to degrade the pretreated PET
films. After being incubated for 7 days under the optimal
conditions, the resulting products were analyzed using HPLC
(Figure 6b). Similarly, the groups containing PETase, either in
free enzymes or on engineered yeast surfaces, were able to
degrade PET films. In addition, the groups of EY-PETase and
EY-PETase + EY-MHETase generated about 20 times more
products than the free enzymes, indicating that the total activity
of the immobilized enzymes on the engineered yeast surfaces has
been significantly improved.
Moreover, the immobilized enzymes can be easily reused. We
next investigated the durability and effectiveness of the
engineered yeasts in degrading PET films. Two groups of EY-
PETase and EY-PETase + EY-MHETase were tested for their
reusability, and wild-type yeast was used as a control. As shown
in Figure 6c, the engineered yeasts were recycled 4 times (a total
of 5 cycles) after incubating with PET films for 3 days under the
optimal reaction conditions. After each cycle, the products were
analyzed using HPLC. The product concentrations showed a
gradual downward trend through successive recycling processes
(Figure 6d). For EY-PETase, approximately 40% of the initial
activity was retained by Cycle 5. For the EY-PETase + EY-
MHETase group, the TPA concentration in Cycle 5 was less
than 30% of the initial value. However, the overall decline in
total degradation performance is likely overestimated if judged
solely by MHET levels, as MHET was further converted to TPA
and EG by MHETase. Therefore, the lower MHET levels in the
EY-PETase + EY-MHETase group reflect enhanced degradation
completeness rather than reduced enzymatic activity. These
results collectively demonstrate that engineered yeast surface
display enhances PETase and MHETase activity and enables
enzyme reuse, making this system promising for large-scale PET
biorecycling.
3.7. Degradation of PET Water Bottles Using Whole-
Cell Biocatalysts. According to Euromonitor International
(London, England), PET plastics for beverage bottles account
for 67% of the market share, and 44.7% for single-serve bottles in
the United States.

PET does not readily decompose when
disposed of in the environment and is known for its
semicrystalline property, which is distinguished by highly
ordered and densely packed crystalline regions. This heightened
degree of crystallinity leads to PET being extremely resistant to
enzymatic degradation.
36,55,56
It is also important to investigate whether our engineered
yeasts displaying PETase and MHETase can degrade semi-
crystalline postconsumer PET plastics, moving beyond
amorphous films. Here, we applied our engineered yeasts to
degrade two commercial drinking water bottles (Great Value
and Deer Park). Because of the blow-mold expansion
processing, drinking water bottles have high crystallinity, and
are less susceptible to enzymatic degradation. We first measured
the crystallinity of various sections of drinking water bottles,
including shoulder, body, transition, and base. As shown in
Figure 7a,b, all sections of the drinking water bottles have a high
crystallinity (from 28 to 31%).
Next, we hole-punched the four sections of the drinking water
bottles into small round punches with a diameter of 7 mm,
respectively. As above, the punches were treated using 1% SDS,

20% ethanol, and distilled water and then preincubated in
glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 9, 0.025% SDS, and 10%
DMSO) for at least 1 h. Under optimal conditions (a pH of 9
and a temperature of 30 °C), the pretreated punches were
degraded using EY-PETase and EY-PETase + EY-MHETase for
7 days. In addition, wild-type yeasts were used as a negative
control. After the incubation, the resulting monomers (BHET,
MHET, and TPA) were measured using HPLC. The results
showed that our engineered yeasts could degrade postconsumer
PET drinking water bottles (Figure 7c,d). Although the high
crystallinity of the drinking water bottles only generated TPA
product at a concentration of less than 20 μM. Our engineered
yeast cells successfully partially degraded two highly crystalline,
postconsumer drinking water bottles into valuable monomers
such as TPA and likely EG, demonstrating the practical potential
of this method for recycling PET waste. This innovative
approach presents a promising strategy for addressing the
growing plastic waste pollution crisis and contributes to the
advancement of sustainable waste management solutions.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we applied synthetic biology to genetically engineer
yeast surfaces to display two PET-degrading enzymes (PETase
and MHETase) that degrade PET plastics. The engineered
yeasts displaying PETase and MHETase could be easily
produced on a large scale through simple yeast cultivation.
Afterward, the enzyme expression on the yeast surfaces was
confirmed by using confocal microscopy and a flow cytometer.
The optimized pH for the degradation of PET films is 9, and the
temperature is 30 °C. Under the optimized degradation
conditions, our developed engineered yeasts as whole-cell
biocatalysts can degrade PET films at a rate more than 20 times
that of free enzymes. In addition, the engineered yeasts can be
reused and maintain 30% of the activity after 4 cycles to degrade
PET films. Furthermore, two postconsumer drinking water
bottles with high crystallinity levels were partially degraded into
value-added TPA and, likely, EG monomer products using our
engineered yeasts, opening a promising avenue to recycle PET
plastic wastes. For real-world applications, practical strategies for
recovering and reusing engineered yeast cells could include
immobilization methods such as encapsulation or attachment to
solid supports, facilitating easy separation and recovery from
reaction mixtures. Further investigations could also explore the
development of cost-effective recycling systems, such as
continuous-flow bioreactors or filtration-based approaches, to
maximize yeast reusability and reduce operational costs. This
innovative approach offers a promising avenue for addressing
the increasing challenges of plastic waste pollution and for
advancing sustainable solutions.
