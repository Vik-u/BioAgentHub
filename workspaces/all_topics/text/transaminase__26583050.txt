Amination of non-activated aliphatic fatty alcohols to the cor-
responding primary amines was achieved through af ive-
enzymec ascade reactionb yc oupling al ong-chain alcoholo x-
idase from Aspergillus fumigatus (LCAO_Af) with a w-transami-
nase from Chromobacterium violaceum (w-TA_Cv).T he alcohol
was oxidized at the expense of molecularo xygen to yield the
correspondinga ldehyde, which wass ubsequently aminated by
the PLP-dependent w-TAt oy ield the final primary amine prod-
uct. The overall cascade was optimized with respect to pH, O2
pressure, substrate concentration, decomposition of H2O2 (de-
rived from alcohol oxidation), NADH regeneration, and biocata-
lyst ratio. The substrate scope of this concept was investigated
under optimized conditions by using terminallyf unctionalized
C4–C11 fatty primary alcohols bearing halogen, alkyne, amino,
hydroxy,t hiol, and nitrile groups.
Biocatalytic cascades have emerged as at ime-, resource-, and
cost-saving strategy in bioorganic synthesis.[1] The use of sever-
al enzymes in ao ne-pot fashion avoids purification/isolationo f
(unstable)i ntermediates and the associated unavoidable loss
of material. Numerous examples of multienzymatic processes
of ever increasing complexity for the production of valuable
compounds[2] indicate that the areaso f“ systemsb iocatalysis”[3]
and pathway engineering[4] are beginning to merge. The syn-
thesis of amines dominates current cascade design because
the occurrence of amines is underrepresented in the pool of
renewable carbon sources, in contrast to their frequentn eed
in chemicals ynthesis.[5]
For instance, terminal alkylamino functionalization of alkanes
and fatty acid methyl esters was achieved by combining an
alkane monooxygenase (AlkBGT) and a w-transaminase in
as ingle designed whole-cells ystem.[6] The coupling of a w-
transaminases with other enzymes, such as acetohydroxyacid
synthase,t ransketolase, varioush ydrolases, and alcohol dehy-
drogenases enabled the synthesis of (chiral) amine deriva-
tives.[7]
The direct transformation of alcohols to amines is only feasi-
ble by metal catalysts,[8] no enzymei sk nown for this reaction.
However,b iocatalytic two-step oxidation–reductivea mination
sequences are known. Oxidationo fa na lcohol by an alcohol
dehydrogenase yields the corresponding aldehyde/ketone,
which can be reductively aminated by an w-transaminase. The
eleganceo ft his redox-neutral process is the internal cofactor
recycling, in which NADH generated during alcoholo xidation
is employed in the reductivea mination step. This concept has
been successfully appliedt oab road range of linear and cyclic
aliphatic primarya nd secondary alcohols, aryl-alkanols, benzylic
alcohols, and a,w-diols for the synthesis of (di)amines.[7]
Alcohol oxidases represent an attractive, but underrepre-
sented, alternative to (thermodynamically disfavoured) nicoti-
namide-dependent alcohol oxidationc atalyzed by alcohold e-
hydrogenases. These enzymes are commonly flavin- or Cu-de-
pendenta nd use O2 as an electrona cceptor.[9] Two-electron
transfer yields H2O2 as ab yproduct, which is destroyedb yc ata-
lase or by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/2,2’-azino-bis(3-
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) system.T his
method is a“ green” alternative to traditional protocols, which
requiret ransition metals, dimethylsulfoxide (e.g. Swern, Pfitz-
ner–Moffato xidation),[10, 11] or nitroxyl radicals (e.g. TEMPO).[12]
Recently,w ee stablished at wo-step one-pot oxidation–trans-
amination cascade based on CuI-dependent galactose oxidase
(GOase) in combination with a w-transaminase.[13] Dictated
by the substrate characteristics of GOasef rom Fusarium
NRRL 2903, only electronically activated benzylic and cinnamic
alcohols werea ccepted, and this method was not applicable
to nonactivated aliphatic (fatty) alcohols. To broaden the sub-
strate scope of this protocol, as earch for as uitable alcohol ox-
idase revealed ap utative flavin-dependent long-chain alcohol
oxidasef rom Aspergillus fumigatus (LCAO_Af) as ap romising
candidate.[14] The enzyme shows homology and sequence
identity( 30–40 %) with other flavoprotein alcohol oxidases and
containst he conserved flavin-bindingd omain (pfam00732) of
the glucose–methanol–choline (GMC) oxidasef amily.L CAO
showsa ctivity in the H2O2/HRP/ABTS and supplementary flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) enhances the activity of the
enzyme( data not shown). Preliminary resultsr eportedt he oxi-
dation of C6–C8 fattya lcohols yielded the corresponding alde-
hydes. Reductivea mination of aliphatic aldehydes through w-
transaminases is well known.[15] To shift the unfavorable equi-

librium towards the amine, the well-established l-alanine
donor system, employing an alanine dehydrogenase( Ala-DH)
combinedw ith an adequate NADH-recycling system, complet-
ed the overall cascade (Scheme1 ).[16] In contrast to CuI-depen-
dent GOase, where alcohol oxidation selectively stops at the al-
dehydes tage, undesired over oxidation of aldehydes to car-
boxylic acids (a common phenomenon for flavin-dependent al-
cohol oxidases) by LCAO_Af had to be taken into account.[17]
The overall performance of the cascade was tuned with re-
spect to the following parameters by using 1-hexanol as sub-
strate (detailed data are given in the Supporting Information):
1) For the removal of H2O2,d isproportionation catalyzed by
catalase from Micrococcus lysodeiktikus or two-electron
transfer mediated by HRP employing ABTS as an electron
sink workede quallyw ell. The latter (chromophoric) ap-
proachh as advantages in screeningc onditions, whereas
the former is more suitable for preparative-scale transfor-
mations (Supporting Information, Table S1).
2) For the reductive amination step, variousn icotinamide co-
factor recycling systems based on glucose/glucose dehy-
drogenase (GDH), formate/formate dehydrogenase (FDH),
and phosphite/phosphite dehydrogenase (PtDH) werec om-
pared: The phosphite/PtDH systemw as the least efficient,
whereas the formate/FDH system led to significant over ox-
idation of the aldehyde intermediate to yield the undesired
carboxylic acid. The bestr esults were obtained with glu-
cose/GDHb yu sing standard conditions, but this result was
not further optimized( Table S2).
3) As ignificant advantage of separateo verexpression of the
oxidase and the w-transaminase is the possibilityt oa djust
the ratio of both enzymes.T he best results were obtained
when LCAO Af and w-TAC v( employed as whole lyophi-
lized cells) were used in ar atio of 2:1( Table S3).
4) The pH profile was investigated within ar ange of pH 5–12
(FigureS 2), which revealed that the efficiency of the cas-
cade continuouslyi ncreased from pH 6( conversion <2% )
to am aximum at pH 10, followed by as harp drop at
pH 12.
5) The efficiency of the cascade was very sensitive towards
elevated product concentrations, deduced from the fact
that increasing amounts of substrate (10–75 mm)l ed to
as teady decrease in conversion and gave comparable
levelso fp roduct ( ð18–20m m,F igure S3).
6) Sincet he solubility of the oxidantO 2 in aqueous systemsi s
limited, experimentsw ere conducted under atmospheric
conditions and at elevated
pressure, which revealed an
optimal performance at 2–
4b ar (TableS 4).
7) To evaluate the overall per-
formance of the optimized
cascade reaction compared
to the initial conditions, the
aminef ormation was fol-
lowed over time. Engineer-
ing of the reactionp arame-
ters led to ac onsiderable improvement of the overall effi-
ciency with full conversion of 1-hexanol to the correspond-
ing amine within 10 h( Figure S4).
To evaluate the substratet olerance (see Table 1) of the bio-
catalytic oxidation–transamination cascader eaction, primary al-
cohols with ac hain length ranging from C4–C11 and derivatives
bearing ah alogen,a lkyne,a mino, hydroxy,t hiol, and nitrile
group were subjected to the enzymatic amination cascade.
In the first screening, variousu nfunctionalized linear aliphat-
ic alcohols with ac hain length ranging from four to eleven
carbon atomsw ere tested, and the performance was measured
as overall conversion to the corresponding amine 1b –8b

verted only moderately (conv. =20 %), significantly enhanced
amine formation was observedb yi ncreasing the chain length,
leadingt oq uantitative conversions forC 6–C8 alcohols (3a–5a ,
entries 3–5). This effect nicely correlates with the fact that
a“ long-chain” alcohol oxidase was used in the oxidation step.
Beyondt his range, conversions gradually decreased again and
reachedo nly 16 %f or 1-undecanol (8a). The decrease in amine
formation for long-chain alcohols was accompanied by signifi-
cant over oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid (6c–
8c), whichi ndicates that long-chain aldehydes are less wella c-
cepted by the w-TA, in addition to possible solubility issues.
Various functional groups were introduced at the C-terminal
end of 1-alkanols, encompassing halogen, amino, alkyne, thiol,
and nitrile functionalities (entries9 –16). For the w-halo-1-alco-
hols, good-to-excellent conversionsw ere obtained [74 %f or 9a
(entry 9) and nearly full conversion for the C6 and C8 chloro an-
alogues 10a and 11a (entries 10, 11). The introduction of at er-
minal nitrile group possessing similar properties as ah alogen
group (i.e. ap seudohalogen) led to as ignificant decrease in
conversion (12 a,c onv.4 2% ,e ntry 12), whereas at erminal eth-
ynyl group of similar size resulted in full conversion (13a,
conv. >99 %, entry 13).
The limitations of the cascade are set by the incompatibility
of amino, hydroxy (diol), and thiol substituents (14 a–16 a,e n-
tries 14–16). Steric factors can be neglected, therefore, the
nonacceptance of substrates bearing polar end groups is most
likely because of their heavy hydration in aqueous medium.
The same is true for secondary aliphatic and activated benzylic
or allylic alcohols, which were not converted independent of
their E/Z configuration (Figure S5).
In view of the preparative-scale applicationo ft he oxida-
tion–aminationc ascade, as even-fold upscaleo ft he optimized
screening conditions was performed with hydroxy-nitrile 12a
and hydroxy-alkyne 13a as substrates. Both products were iso-
lated after derivatization to the corresponding ethyl N-carba-
mates of 12b and 13b in 42 %a nd with complete conversion
in case of the w-nitrile analogue.
In conclusion, af ive-enzyme cascade for the aminationo f
primary alcohols by coupling al ong-chain alcohol oxidase with
a w-transaminaseh as been successfully extended to also en-
compass nonactivated fatty alcohols as substrates. Long-chain
alcohol oxidase from A. fumigatus was exploited as an excel-
lent oxidation catalyst for ab road range of w-functionalized
aliphatic C4–C11 alcohols, which gave the corresponding pri-
mary amines with good-to-excellentc onversionb yu sing w-TA
from C. violaceum.
Experimental Section
General procedure for amination of alcohols
Lyophilized whole E. coli BL21(DE3) cell preparations containing
overexpressed genes of w-TA_Cv[18] (20 mg) and LCAO_Af (40 mg)
were both resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (500 mLe ach,
100 mm,p H1 0) supplemented with pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP,
2m m), NAD+ (2 mm)a nd FAD( 1m m). The samples were shaken at
30 8Ca nd 120 rpm for 30 min in Eppendorf vials (horizontal posi-
tion) and were combined after rehydration. As olution of l-alanine
(100 mm), ammonium chloride (67 mm), and d-glucose (80 mm)i n
sodium phosphate buffer (500 mL, 100 mm,p H1 0.0) was added.
Alanine dehydrogenase (Ala-DH) from B. subtilis (0.013 U), glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH from DSM, 2U ), and catalase (1700 U) from
M. lysodeikticus were added. Finally,t he substrate (10 mm)w as
added and the reaction mixture was placed into an oxygen pres-
sure chamber.[19] The apparatus was primed with oxygen (technical
grade) for about 1m in and pressurized to 2b ar.T he reaction mix-
ture was shaken at RT and 170 rpm for 24 h. The conversion was
determined by GC-MS analysis after derivatization of the corre-
sponding primary amine with ethyl(succinimidooxy)formate (see
the Supporting Information).
