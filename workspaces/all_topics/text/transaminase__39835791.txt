ABSTRACT
Objective: The study focused the contraceptive 
efficacy of hydro-ethanolic (60:40) extract (HEE) of 
Caesalpinia pulcherrima  leaves in human and rat sperm 
samples by in vitro study.
Methods: Six young fertile adult males were selected 
for semen collection. Sperm samples were collected from 
six adult rat also by chopping the epididymis along with the 
collection of testicles, epididymis, and liver. The semen, 
sperm, and tissue samples were grouped into control, 1, 2, 
and 4 mg HEE exposed categories. Sensitive spermiological 
sensors, androgenic key enzymes, oxidative stress, and 
metabolic toxicity markers were assessed according to 
standard protocols. Human semen samples, rat sperm 
samples and metabolic tissue samples were divided into 16 
test tubes in all of the above groups to find out the direct 
effect of the extract on such sensors in concentration and 
duration dependent manner.
Results: Spermiological sensors both in human and rat 
were decreased significantly (p<0.05) in concentration and 
duration dependent manner after in vitro exposure of HEE 
against the control group. Testicular Δ5,3β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 
superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were 
significantly (p<0.05) decreased, and level of the end 
product of lipid oxidation-peroxidation was elevated 
(p<0.05) in rat after extract charging. No general toxicity 
imposition of the said extract indicated by the activities 
of hepatic transaminases. Phytochemical screening was 
done by qualitative and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry analysis.
Conclusion: Extract focused the promising male 
contraceptive potentiality at 2 mg/ml concentration. Mode 
of action will be unfolded from running in vivo study very 
shortly.

INTRODUCTION
Rapid population growth is one of the major issues in 
emerging nations like India. According to 2011 census of 
India, the population crossed 1.21 billion, and the world 
population will rise to 9.2 billion by the year 2050, which will 
impose a negative impact on social, economic, health, and 
natural resources (Shibeshi et al., 2006; Deeming, 2021). 
There is an urgent need to control the human population 
to ensure the betterment of human life. Family planning 
is an important strategy to control the overburdened 
population. Different contraceptives are used to tackle 
this global problem. Several female contraceptives are 
marketed, but males have not focused attentively in this 
regard, though responsibility for family planning is equal 
for male and female spouses (Verma & Yadav, 2021). So, 
now investigators have concentrated their investigation on 
male contraceptive regimens. In the market, several male 
contraceptives are procurable, though having high failure 
rates, and are not widely accepted. Different accessible 
steroidal contraceptives have severe side effects or toxic 
actions when used for short-term and long-term purposes 
(Jain et al., 2017 ). In that context, there is a need to 
establish a safe, efficient, eco-friendly, and affordable male 
contraceptive to slow down the increasing population. 
From ancient history, many plants have been adopted 
as a folk medicine for curative purposes of numerous 
diseases as well as for contraceptive purposes. Few herbs 
are familiar with having antifertility properties either by 
suppressing spermatogenesis or spermicidal action (Kamal 
et al., 2003). 
This in vitro experiment was conducted to check the 
direct effect of the hydro-ethanolic (3:2) extract (HEE) 
of the Caesalpinia pulcherrima leaves on human and rat 
samples.
In consonance with this herbal plant-based study, 
previously our laboratory conducted a comprehensive 
study about the spermicidal effects of HEE of Stephania 
hernandifolia and Achyranthes aspera in rat and human 
sperm (Paul et al., 2010). According to in vitro studies 
of others, the compound NIM-76, which was extracted 
from neem oil, reported 100 percent spermicidal action 
against rat and human sperm (Riar et al., 1990). The 
seed extract of Carica papaya has an immobilizing effect 
on sperm noted by an in vitro study (Lohiya et al., 
2000). C. pulcherrima also known as ‘Pride of Barbados’ 
locally known as “Radhachura,” belongs to the Fabaceae 
family, distributed mainly in West Bengal, Tamilnadu, 
Kerala, Karnataka, and throughout India. This plant 
has some impressive health benefits, found to possess 
antitumor, antimicrobial, abortifacient, cardioprotective, 
lipid-lowering, hepato-protective, antiulcer, antiasthma, 
and hypoglycemic activities (Mitra & Mukherjee, 2009; 
Kumar et al., 2010; Zanin et al., 2012). According to a 
traditional Chinese herbal medicine, C. pulcherrima has 
a folk reputation for possessing an antimotility effect on 
sperm (Pankaj et al., 2011). However, there is a lacuna 
of detailed information about the anti-spermiological 
activity of C. pulcherrima leaves. In our pilot study, HEE 
reflected the maximum effect for anti-testicular activity 
among other extracts. Therefore, HEE was selected as 
an effective extract in this concern. Till now, the mode 
of action for male contraceptive activity of this plant is 
beyond our knowledge. Considering this background, 
the present study was designed to explore the effect of 
the said plant on sperm parameters following an in vitro 
protocol with the goal of developing a potent herbal male 
contraceptive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Ethanol (Changshu Hongsheng Fine Chemical Co., 
Ltd, No.8 Haifeng Road, Changshu City, China) for 
extraction. Chemicals like glutaraldehyde, eosin, gelatin, 
and glycerol were also procured from Merck Life Science 
Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. Fructose, EDTA, 
were provided by Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., 
Maharashtra, India.
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and sodium citrate were 
purchased from Merck, Mumbai, India. Pyrogallol was 
supplied by Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. Maharashtra, India.
Collection of plant materials
C. pulcherrima mature leaves were collected from the 
Vidyasagar University campus in West Bengal, India. The 
leaves were cleaned using redistilled water and then dried 
under shade at room temperature and authenticated (No. 
VU/BIO/CP-2022) by a taxonomist in the Department of 
Botany and Forestry, Vidyasagar University. Leaves were 
ground into a coarse powder using an electric grinder.
Plant extract preparation
Dried powder of C. pulcherrima  leaves (100 g) was 
mixed with hydro-ethanol at the ratio 3:2 in 1 lit solvent, 
left for 48 hrs at room temperature and stirred at 2 hrs 
intervals. After that, the mixture was filtered. The solvent 
extract was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (EYELA, 
China). The remaining extract was allowed to dry, and this 
powdered extract was collected and kept at 4ºC for this in 
vitro experiment.
Experimental design for in vitro study
The biological samples of both the human and rat models 
were used to conduct this in vitro study. Human semen 
samples were obtained from 6 healthy fertile individuals 
after 4–5 days of sexual abstinence, and everybody gave 
their signed consent (Chaudhury et al., 2004 ). In vitro 
testing of the collected semen samples was performed after 
spontaneous coagulation and reliquification. The samples 
have normal sperm count, motility, viability, and normal 
morphology, as per World Health Organization (WHO) 
laboratory manual (World Health Organization, 2010).
In a rat model, regarding the care of animals, the 
standard protocol of the Institutional Ethics Committee 
(IEC) was followed for processing and handling of the 
samples. Six matured, fertile rats, two months of age and 
weighing 150 g, were selected for these investigations. For 
the acclimatization of rats in laboratory conditions, animals 
were kept for seven days in the controlled environment of 
the animal house. After that, the animals were sacrificed, 
and sperm cells were obtained by washing the cauda 
epididymis with normal saline. Testicles, epididymis, and 
liver were dissected and cleaned with normal saline. 
Insertions have been given in both poles of these organs 
for the proper penetration of in vitro media and extract. 
Sperm pellets (rat and human) were prepared using the 
centrifugation method. Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) 
solution (pH 7.4) was used as an in vitro medium.
Focusing the statistical standpoint, here we increased 
the sample size 6 to 16 by cutting the tissues or distributing 
the sperm samples of 6 subjects to 16 for noting the 
authentic effect of the extract. Simultaneously from the 
ethical point of view, 6 animals were used in each group 
or sub group.
Here, experimental groups were divided into the 
following-
Experimental groups
Control groups
Human and rat sperm samples, sliced tissues such as 
testicles, epididymis, and liver of rat were kept in sixteen 
separate test tubes for each sample (n=16) with 10 ml 
KRB solution to maintain the osmotic balance and optimal 
pH of the medium without any extract exposure. Sperms 
of rat and human were mixed with physiological saline 
in a 1:1 ratio. Then, at 37 ºC, the mixture was incubated, 
maintaining 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 supply for two hrs at a 
velocity of 30 bubbles per min. The spermiological sensors 
were investigated at the intervals of 20 secs, 15 mins, and 
30 mins incubation periods. Sperm pellets (rat and human) 
and the above-mentioned tissues were kept in test tubes 
without any extract exposure for biochemical assessment 
at the end of the incubation period (2 hrs) considered as 
control group.
HEE - charged groups
Test tubes contained 10 ml KRB media, where pre-
mentioned extract at the concentration of 1, 2, and 4 mg/
ml were directly charged in different test tubes and kept 
in an incubator. For each dose exposed group, sixteen test 
tubes were allotted for each sample. Separate test tubes 
were used for human and rat samples study.
Sperm motility
Motile sperm were counted and expressed in terms of 
percentage in control and three concentrations of HEE (1, 
2, 4 mg/ml) charged groups for separate three duration of 
exposure. A drop of the incubated in vitro mixture from the 
control and duration dependent different extract-charged 
groups was put on different glass slides, covered by a 
coverslip, and viewed under 400X magnification (Olympus, 
Olympus Opto Systems India Pvt. Ltd. Noida, India) to 
evaluate sperm motility (Zemjanis, 1970).
IC50 value of sperm motility
Fifty percent inhibitory concentration of (IC 50) the 
extract on sperm motility was calculated for both human 
and rat (Ratnasooriya et al., 1991).
Sperm viability
The viable sperm were determined, taking no color by 
eosin and counter-stained by nigrosine. The pink-stained 
(dead) and unstained (living) sperm on the prepared slides 
were counted under a 400X microscope and noted in terms 
of percentage (World Health Organization, 1999).
Hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test
The structural and functional integrities of the plasma 
membrane of spermatozoa were evaluated by the exposure 
of the sperm cells to a hypo-osmotic solution following a 
standard method (Jeyendran et al., 1984). The suspension 
of sperm was combined with pre-warmed solution (0.735% 
of sodium citrate and 1.351% of fructose in 100 ml distilled 
water) at the ratio of 1:9 and incubated at 37 ºC for 2 hrs. 
Tail curling was observed to indicate the normal integrity 
of spermatozoa through microscopic observation and 
expressed in percentage.
Acrosomal intactness status (AIS) test
Gelatin was used to coat the clean glass slide, and after 
24 hrs, it was fixed with 0.05 % glutaraldehyde solution to 
assess the acrosomal status of sperm. Smears were made 
on gelatin-coated slides using diluted sperm samples. 
The gelatin was broken down by sperm-derived enzymes,

which make haloes surrounding the head part of sperm, 
and the percentage was recorded (Gopalkrishnan, 1995).
Estimation of activities of Δ5,3β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17β-HSD
Androgenic key enzymes, i.e., Δ5,3β-HSD and 
17β-HSD, activities were assessed (Jarabak  et al., 
1962; Talalay, 1962). The solution contains five mM of 
potassium phosphate, 20% spectroscopic graded glycerol, 
and 1 mM EDTA. The testicular sample was allowed for 
homogenization (Bio-Lab, India) at a tissue density of 
1g/10ml, allowing for centrifugation (HERMLE, Germany) 
for 30 mins at 10000 rpm at 4 ºC. The enzyme kinetics 
was measured using the supernatant as per the standard 
methods. At intervals of 30 secs, optical density at 340 
nm was recorded for 3 mins using a spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, China).
Estimation of antioxidant enzyme activities
Testis, epididymis, and liver tissues from rats, as well 
as sperm pellets from both rat and human samples, were 
homogenized in an ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (0.05 M) at a 
tissue concentration of 50 mg/ml for the assessment of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. 
Then, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation 
(4ºC) at 10000 rpm for 10 mins.
In a cuvette, 2.04 ml (50 mM) Tris buffer (pH-8.2), 20 
μl of pyrogallol, and 20 μl of the sample were added for 
the SOD activity assessment. Optical density was noted 
in each sample in comparison to a blank at 420 nm in 30 
secs intervals for three mins (Marklund & Marklund, 1974). 
In a spectrophotometer cuvette, 0.5 ml of 0.00035 M 
H2O2 (Merck, Mumbai, India), 2.5 ml of distilled water, and 
40 µl of the sample were added. After that, at every 30 
secs interval, six readings of the sample against the blank 
were collected at 240 nm to estimate CAT activity (Beers 
& Sizer, 1952).
Estimation of thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substances (TBARS)
A well-acceptable method was used for the assessment 
of TBARS level. Testicular tissue, epididymis, and liver 
from rat whereas sperm pellets of human and rat were 
homogenized in 0.1 M of ice-cold phosphate buffer (pH 
7.4) at a 50 mg/ml tissue concentration and centrifuged at 
10000 rpm at 4ºC for 5 mins. The optical density was noted 
at 535 nm in a spectrophotometer (Ohkawa et al., 1979). 
Assessment of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities
The activities of AST and ALT were also measured in the 
liver, testis, and epididymis after in vitro exposure of the 
extract in the said concentrations of the rat tissue samples 
using the standard methods (Jagadeesan & Kavitha, 
2006). Two reaction mixtures were prepared separately, 
one for AST and another for ALT. After one hr for AST and 
30 mins for ALT, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 
37ºC after adding 0.2 ml homogenate. The reaction was 
terminated by the addition of 1 ml DNPH reagent, and 
the test tubes were maintained at room temperature for 
twenty mins. The color was developed by introducing 10 
ml of 0.4N sodium hydroxide solution, and optical density 
was recorded at 520 nm using the UV spectrophotometer 
against blank.
Phytochemical investigation of HEE of C. 
pulcherrima leaves
The presence of phytochemicals, i.e., alkaloids, 
flavonoids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, terpenoids, 
glycosides, and steroids in the decoction of C. pulcherrima 
leaves were studied qualitatively using the standard 
methods (Mitra et al., 2020).
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-
MS) analysis
The QuattroMicroTMAPI mass spectrometer and Waters 
2695 separation module (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) were 
used to perform LC-MS studies. The liquid chromatographic 
system comprised the quaternary pump, autosampler, 
online vacuum degasser, and thermostatic column 
compartment. It was linked in line to a photodiode array 
detector (Waters 2998) in front of the mass spectrometer. 
MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters) was considered for noting 
data and processing. The autosampler injected a 10 μl 
sample (HEE of C. pulcherrima leaves) into the LC system. 
Solvent ‘A’ was 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and solvent ‘B’ 
was 6% methanol: acetonitrile (2:1), used as a mobile 
phase. Using a PDA detector, every compound was found 
to be between 191-690 nm (Das et al., 2023).
Ethical considerations
This study was ethically permitted from Institutional 
Animal Ethics Committee (VU/IAEC/10/7/2022). Informed 
consent was taken from each of the participant as per 
human ethics protocol of ICMR.
Statistical analysis
The results were presented as mean±standard error of 
the mean (SEM). ANOVA followed by “Multiple-comparisons 
Student’s two-tail – ‘t’ test” was used for statistical analysis 
of data (Sokal & Rohle, 1997).
RESULTS
Sperm motility
In both human and rat sperm, after exposure of dif- 
ferent concentrations of extract, the percentage of motile 
sperm was decreased significantly (p<0.05) than the con- 
trol group. According to the WHO (2010), more than 40% 
of motile sperm in semen is one of the determinants of 
male fertility. In human sperm samples, after exposure to 
2 mg extract for ½ an hr, the number of motile sperm  
was noted below the WHO reference value. In the 1 mg 
HEE-charged group, less than 40% motile sperm was not   
observed in 20 secs, 15, and 30 mins incubation periods. 
In the 4 mg HEE-charged group, the reference level of 
WHO value of motile sperms for infertility was noted at 
all incubation times, and after 30 mins of incubation, 
complete immobilization in human sperm was observed.
As there are no such reference values for rat sperm 
analysis, the WHO reference value of human was translated 
for rat sperm analysis. Less than 40% motile sperm were 
noted in the 1 mg/ml extract–exposed group after 30 
mins of incubation. However, in 2 and 4 mg/ml extract-
charged groups, the motile sperm count was less than the 
borderline of the said reference value in all said incubation 
times. After 30 mins of incubation, both 2 and 4 mg HEE-
charged groups showed a 100 % immobilization effect on 
rat sperm (Figure 1).
IC 50 value of sperm motility
The concentration of the extract results for 50% 
inhibition in the count of motile sperm, known as IC 50, and 
the value of the above-said extract for human sperm was 
noted at 2.45 mg/ml concentration, and for rat sperm, it 
was 1.6 mg/ml (Figure 2).
Sperm viability
In both human and rat sperm, after being exposed 
to different concentrations of extract, the percentage of 
viable sperm was significantly lower (p<0.05) than the 
control group. According to WHO (2010), less than 58% of 
viable sperm results infertility. After direct exposure to the 
different concentrations of extract to human spermatozoa,

less than 58% viable sperm were observed after 30 mins 
of incubation in the 2 mg HEE-charged group. In contrast, 
in the 1 mg HEE-charged groups, the viable sperm count 
percentage remained above the lower borderline in all 
the above three durations of exposure. In the 4 mg HEE-
charged groups, the viable sperm percentage was below 
the reference value in all three incubation periods.
In case of rat, viable sperm count was below the WHO 
reference value at 2 and 4 mg/ml HEE-charged groups 
after all the said incubation times. However, less than 58% 
of viable sperms was not observed in 1 mg HEE-charged 
groups in all said durations of exposure (Figure 3).
Hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test
According to WHO, less than 58% of swelled human 
sperm indicated as abnormal semen and results infertility. 
After direct exposure to said plant extract at different 
concentrations (1, 2, 4 mg/ml), hypoosmotic swelled 
tail curling sperm (human and rat) were significantly 
decreased (p<0.05) when compared to the control. In 
human spermatozoa, at 2 mg concentration, the HOS 
sperm were below the WHO cut-off value after 15 and 30 
mins of incubation, whereas, in the concentration of 4 mg, 
the value was noted in all three incubation periods. This 
sensor was not below that limit at the 1 mg HEE-charged 
groups at any above three incubation periods.
Less than 58% of hypoosmotic swelled sperm of rats 
were present in all the said three durations when it was 
exposed to 2 and 4 mg/ml HEE of C. pulcherrima leaves. In 
contrast, after the 1 mg HEE-charging, the percentage of 
HOS-positive sperm below the cut-off level was not noted 
in any duration of said exposure (Figure 4).
Acrosomal intactness status (AIS) test
Direct exposure of sperm to different concentrations 
of C. pulcherrima leaves extract showed a significant 
(p<0.05) reduction in acrosome intact spermatozoa count 
with respect to the control. In human, less than 40% of 
sperm with intact acrosomes are reflected as a lower limit 
for fertility (Chan et al., 1999). After 15 and 30 mins of 
incubations with direct exposure to 4 mg HEE, the human 
sperm with intact acrosome count were below the refer- 
ence value. However, the value of these sensors remained 
above that reference value in all the said incubation periods

in 1 and 2 mg HEE-charged groups. In rat spermatozoa, 
below the stated cut-off value was noted at 2 mg HEE-
charged group after 30 mins of incubation, and similarly, 
at 4 mg HEE-charged group, less than the cut-off value 
with intact acrosome were noted after 15 and 30 mins 
of incubation time. However, the count remained above 
that reference value in all the said durations at 1 mg HEE-
exposed groups (Figure 5).
Activities of testicular Δ5, 3β- HSD and 17β-HSD 
After two hrs of incubation, testicular Δ5,3β- HSD, and 
17β-HSD activities were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the 
groups subjected for exposure to 2 and 4 mg doses than 
the group exposed to 1 mg dose and the control groups. 
Significant alteration was not noted in these parameters 
between the control and the group subject to 1 mg 
exposure.
In comparison  between 2 and 4 mg/ml charged 
groups, the HEE of C. pulcherrima showed a statistically 
insignificant difference (p>0.05) of the above parameters 
(Figure 6).
Estimation of antioxidant enzyme activities
After 2 hrs of incubation, the SOD and CAT activities 
in the testis and epididymis of experimental rats were 
significantly inhibited (p<0.05) in 2 and 4 mg HEE-charged 
groups compared to the control group. However, significant 
differences (p>0.05) were not noted in the activities of 
these parameters between 1 mg and the control groups.
Activities of SOD and CAT in rat sperm pellets were 
inhibited significantly (p<0.05) in all extract-exposed 
groups in respect to the control. But in the human sperm 
pellets, SOD and CAT activities were reduced significantly 
(p<0.05) in 2 and 4 mg extract exposed groups, whereas

no significant (p>0.05) inhibition was observed between 1 
mg and the control groups. The activities of said sensors 
in hepatic tissue were not altered significantly (p>0.05) 
among the groups subjected to extract exposure and the 
control group (Table 1).
Quantity of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 
(TBARS)
After 2 hrs of incubation in 2 and 4 mg HEE-exposed 
groups, the level of TBARS was significantly elevated 
(p<0.05) in the reproductive tissue sample, i.e., testis 
and epididymis of rat when comparison was made with the 
control group. No significant difference was noted in TBARS 
level (p>0.05) between 1 mg and the control groups. 
The quantity of TBARS was elevated significantly 
(p<0.05) in rat sperm pellets in all the groups exposed to 
different doses compared to the control. In human sperm 
pellets, the level of TBARS was significantly increased 
(p<0.05) in 2 and 4 mg extract exposed groups with 
respect to the control and 1 mg exposed groups.

Insignificant changes (p>0.05) in hepatic TBARS level 
were noted among the exposed charged and control groups 
(Table 2).
Assessment of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities
Activities of AST and ALT in the liver, testis, and 
epididymis in the rat showed no significant difference 
(p>0.05) in all HEE-exposed groups when a comparison 
was made with the control group (Table 3).
Analysis of the phytochemicals of HEE of C. 
pulcherrima leaves
Biochemical analysis of the nature of phytomolecule
(s) showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, 
tannins, and terpenoids in the HEE of C. pulcherrima  
leaves (Table 4).
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-
MS) analysis
The LC-MS analysis of HEE of C. pulcherrima leaves 
showed seven major peaks with retention times of 8.54, 
12.28, 13.41, 13.52, 15.49, 17.56, and 21.39 mins. 
Subsequently, every peak underwent fragmentation, given 
seven fragmentation spectra featuring potential masses 
(m/z) at positive ions 424.05, 354.01, 318.23, 432, 
621.66, and 324.33 and one at negative ions with having 
candidates mass (m/z) 461.91 (Table 5, Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
Human and rat sperm were used in this in vitro 
experiment to determine the impact of the HEE of C. 
pulcherrima leaves on sperm-disrupting activity in relation 
to the development of male contraceptive. Rat sperm, 
reproductive, and metabolic tissues and human semen 
samples were included to unfold the functioning principle 
of the phytomolecule(s) that existed in the extract for 
the execution of male contraceptive effects. As clear cut-
off values are not available for routine sperm analysis of 
rat and their fertility assessment like human so, we have 
used the WHO reference values of spermiological sensors 
of human for the analysis of spermiological parameters of 
rat in relation to validate the male contraceptive efficacy 
of the extract. For this purpose, the cut-off values for the 
fertility of human sperm were translated into rat. Sperm 
motility is a vital sensor for male fertility assessment. 
Sperm fertilizing capacity depends not only on its motility 
but also on sperm membrane intactness and acrosome 
status. The motility of spermatozoa is depends on the 
generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative 
phosphorylation (Tourmente et al., 2015). A considerable 
amount of decrement in sperm motility percentage in 
the extract-charged group, possibly due to the disruption 
of sperm mitochondrial function and inhibition in ATP 
generation by phytomolecule(s) (Riar et al., 1990). It was 
supported by the IC50 value for sperm motility of the HEE 
of C. pulcherrima leaves. A lower percentage of viable and 
hypoosmotic swelled sperm (human and rat) after extract 
exposure, that affect the membrane integrity possibly 
by imposition of lipid peroxidation along with the sperm-
plasma membrane destruction by inducing oxidative stress 
(Agarwal et al., 2014). These have been confirmed by the 
elevation in the quantity of free radical end products, i.e., 
TBARS level in reproductive tissues (testis, epididymis) 
and sperm pellets (human and rat), as well as decreased 
activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., SOD and CAT in re- 
productive tissues of rat (testis, epididymis) and sperm

pellets (human and rat). The said extract may have a 
sperm-specific effect supported by less oxidative stress 
imposition in secondary reproductive and metabolic organs. 
This may be due to the high content of saturated fatty 
acids in sperm cells (Agarwal et al., 2014). It is generally 
recognized that the plant derivatives severely impede the 
sperm cells membrane-related enzymes hyaluronidase and 
acrosin, which are required for the sperm cell to proceed 
forward in the cervix to fertilize (Sabeti et al., 2016). After 
extract exposure, inactivation of these acrosomal enzymes 
may occur by the phytomolecule(s), which results in 
low interaction with gelatine-coated slides. The extract 
may ultimately hamper the capacitation and acrosome 
reactions of sperm necessary for fertilization (Dutta et al., 
2021). The reduction in two key steroidogenic enzyme 
activities, i.e., Δ5, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD  activities, also 
supports the contraceptive efficacy of the extract. This 
inhibition possibly due to the presence of phytomolecule(s) 
that act as competitive or non-competitive inhibitor(s) by 
binding with the enzymes or by altering the structure of 
the enzymes through allosteric modulation (Wang et al., 
2016). The preliminary phytochemical investigation of HEE 
extract of C. pulcherrima leaves revealed the presence 
of alkaloid, flavonoid, terpenoid, and phenol. The LC-
MS analysis of the plant extract also confirms the three 
flavonoids (myricetin, apigenin diglycosides, and apigenin 
glucoside), two alkaloids (protopine, and dimethylene 
berberine), one phenol (chrysoeriol hexoside) and one 
terpenoid (amyrone). According to existing literature, the 
presence of these phytochemical components resulted 
spermicidal, antispermatogenic, and antiandrogenic 
activities (Verma & Yadav, 2021). So, it may be expressed 
that the HEE of C. pulcherrima  leaves has a negative 
modulatory effect on sperm characteristics such as motility, 
viability, acrosome cap status, and HOS in a concentration-
dependent manner. Activities of AST and ALT in the liver, 
testis, and epididymis were measured in this experiment to 
identify the reproductive and metabolic toxicity of HEE of 
C. pulcherrima leaves. Insignificant changes in the level of 
such parameters reflected that different concentrations of 
leaf extract used here don’t have any toxic effects on both 
reproductive and metabolic organs, which focused that the 
said extract at the above doses may be used safely.
In human and rat sperm, 2 mg concentration showed 
the maximum therapeutic effect on spermiological sensors 
and other concerning parameters, whereas 1 mg of HEE 
showed no such effectiveness for spermicidal effect in all 
the cases. Though 4 mg in a few cases is more effective 
than 2 mg dose, from the viewpoint of safety factors, 2 
mg dose is considered as optimal for this purpose. One 
possible hypothesis is that the extract may contain the 
requisite amount of the concerned phytomolecule(s) in 2 
mg HEE that results in maximum efficacy for this purpose 
in most of the sensors compared to other doses (Ghosh et 
al., 2018). No additional therapeutic response was shown 
at 4 mg concentration, which may be explained by spare 
receptor theory or receptor reserve or efficiency reserve 
theory, which provides a buffer enabling the phytomole- 
cule(s) to maintain their efficacy even if not all receptors 
are occupied at any given time. The efficiency of the 2 mg 
dose is not identical in both human and rat, which may be 
due to species-specific activity.
Despite the promising findings from our in vitro  
experiments on the HEE of C. pulcherrima leaves for male 
contraceptive development, this study still has some 
limitations need to be addressed. In vitro experiments, 
although valuable for initial screening and mechanistic 
studies, may not fully replicate the complex physiological 
85

environment of the body which is focused by in vivo. 
Factors such as metabolism, systemic circulation, and 
tissue-specific interactions are not captured in vitro. This 
limitation underscores the need for subsequent in vivo 
studies to confirm the efficacy and safety of the extract in 
a more physiologically relevant context (Ghallab & Bolt, 
2014).
CONCLUSION
From this in vitro experiment, it may be concluded 
that the HEE of C. pulcherrima leaves has direct male 
contraceptive activity addressing some limitations though 
future research is essential.
