Abstract: 
The multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) is yielded by the acti on of reverse transcriptase of retro-element in a wide range o f 
pathogenic bacteria. Upon this phenomenon, it has been show n that msDNA is only produced by Eubacteria because many 
Eubacteria species contained reverse transcriptase in their specia l retro-element. We have screened around 111 Archaea at KEGG 
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database available at genome net server and observed three Methanosarcina species 
(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei), which also contained reverse transcriptase in their genome sequences. This observation of 
reverse transcriptase in Archaea raises questions regarding the or igin of this enzyme. The evolut ionary relationship between these 
two domains of life (Eubacteria and Archaea) hinges upon the phen omenon of retrons. Interestingly, the evolutionary trees based  
on the reverse transcriptases (RTs) and 16S ribosomal RNAs poin t out that all the Eubacteria RTs were descended from Archaea 
RTs during their evolutionary times. In addition, we also ha ve shown some significant structural features among the newly 
identified msDNA-Yf79 in Yersinia frederiksenii with other of its related msDNAs (m sDNA-St85, msDNA-Vc95, msDNA-Vp96, 
msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83) from pathogenic bacteria. Together  the degree of sequence conservation among these msDNAs, 
the evolutionary trees and the distribution of these ret (reverse transcriptase) genes suggest a possible evolutionary scenario. The 
single common ancestor of the organisms of Eubact eria and Archaea subgroups probably achieved this ret gene during their 
evolution through the vertical descent rather than the horizontal  transformations followed by integration into this organism 
genome by a mechanism related to phage recognition and/or transposition. 
 
Keywords: msDNA, reverse transcriptase, phylogenetic tree. 
 
 
 
Background: 
Bacterial chromosomes often carry integrated genetic elements 
(for example transposons, prophages and islands) whose 
precise functions and contribution to the evolutionary fitness of 
the host bacterium are still unknown [1]. These elements are 
often associated with the pathogenicity of the organisms, for 
example the CTX φ prophage, which encodes cholera toxin in 
Vibrio cholerae [1]. Retron is also a transposable element [2] 
found in various pathogenic bacteria [3]. The retron is 
consisting of three regions- msr (encodes RNA part of msDNA), 
msd (encodes DNA part of msDNA) and a ret gene for reverse 
transcriptase (RT) [4-6]. This enzyme is responsible for the

production of multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) 
containing both DNA and RNA covalently linked by a 
branched rG residue [4-6]. Although, reverse transcriptase (RT) 
was first discovered in virus [7], now this enzyme is frequently 
found in bacteria which are then prokaryotic reverse 
transcriptase to be discovered [4-6]. The discovery of reverse 
transcriptase in bacteria raises questions regarding the origin of 
this enzyme. The reverse transcriptase (RT) consisting of several 
conserved regions common to all retrons, can thus be used for a 
comprehensive evolutionary anal y s i s  o f  r e t r o n s .  T o  s o l v e  a  
question regarding the origin of retron encoding ret (reverse 
transcriptase) gene, we have compared the retro-element 
reverse transcriptase (RT) sequen ces in different bacteria. The 
phylogenetic trees constructed from this present study provide 
a framework to appraise possible hypothesis for the origin and 
evolution of different categories of retrons present in different 
organisms. We have taken Eubacteria and Archaea for 
screening purpose to see an evolutionary relationship between 
these two domains of life on the basis of there ret (reverse 
transcriptase) genes.  
 
Methodology: 
Sequence Retrieval 
The amino acid sequences of reverse transcriptase (RT) and the 
nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) such as 
Archaea:  Methanosarcina species: ( M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and 
M.mazei); Eubacteria: Yersinia species ( Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis); 
Myxobacteria species ( S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, 
N.exedens and M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, 
V.parahaemolyticus and V.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium; 
and Escherichia coli  species (Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific 
Enterobacteria phage phiR73, ECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and 
ECOR58)- were retrieved  from ExPASy proteomics server 
(http://expasy.org/). In addition, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S 
rRNA) nucleotide sequences of Archaea: Methanosarcina species 
(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei ) and Eubacteria: Yersinia 
species ( Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species 
(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca
, N.exedens and 
M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus  and  
V.mimicus); S. Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli  K-12 were 
retrieved from the KEGG or ganism database, Japan 
(http://www.genome.jp/). 
 
Generation of Gene and Phylogenetic Trees 
Identical conserved regions of reverse transcriptase (RT) amino 
acid sequences of Archaea:  Methanosarcina species: 
(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei ); Eubacteria: Yersinia 
species ( Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species 
(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and 
M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and 
V.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli species 
(Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific Enterobacteria phage phiR73, 
ECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and ECOR58) scored in the alignment 
constructed by using (CLUSTALW) 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) [8] were used 
to generate a gene ( ret) tree.   The sequence alignment was 
performed under default conditions and the gene tree was 
constructed by the neighbor-joining [9] and distance matrix 
methods. The poorly aligned N-terminals and C-terminals 
sequence of alignments and also the internal gaps residue were 
taken off from the alignments to  make a precise evolutionary 
tree by using the Jalview program [10]. The phylogenetic tree of 
16S ribosomal RNAs of those organisms was also constructed 
based on their nucleotide sequences by using (CLUSTALW) 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) [8].

residue in RNA portion of msDNAs is circled and forming a 2 ', 
5'-phosphodiester bond with DNA portion of msDNAs (A-F). 
Both the DNA and RNA secondary stem loop structures were 
suggested on the basis of their sequences. The RNA portion was 
boxed and the numbers of RNA and DNA were begun from 5' 
ends. The conserved nucleotides are indicated by stars in all 
msDNAs. The msDNA-Yf79 (A) is predicted from Yersinia 
frederiksenii [11], msDNA-St85 (B) is isolated from S.typhimurium 
[13], msDNA-Vc95 (C) is from V.cholerae [14], msDNA-Vp96 (D) 
is from V.parahaemolyticus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished 
data), msDNA-Ec78 (E) is from E.coli strain 110 [12] and 
msDNA-Ec83 (F) from E.coli strain 161 [3]. The conserved 
sequence for cleavage is indicated by boxes and base 
substitution pointed out by arrows. 
 
Results and discussion: 
Comparative Study of Multicopy Single-Stranded DNA 
(msDNA) Structures 
Recently, we have perceived that a new msDNA-Yf79 exist in 
Yersinia frederiksenii  ATCC 33641 contig01029  cell types and 
compared it’s properties to that of St-85, Vc-95 and Vp-96 [11]. 
However, the present study has revealed the close relatedness 
of this msDNA-Yf79 with msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 from 
E.coli strains 110, 161 respectively (Figure 2)  [ 12, 3] . These 
msDNAs shared a number of highly conserved nucleotides in 
their DNA-RNA complex sequences (Figure 1).  The sequence 
5'-TAGA-3' box was conserved in msDNA-Yf79 [11], msDNA-
St85 [13], msDNA-Vc95 [14] and msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 
2003, unpublished data) (Figure 1A-1D).  The box 5'-TTGA-3' 
was conserved in msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 [12, 3] . The 
conserved tetra nucleotides (5'-TTGA-3') would play an 
important role in the recognition and cleavage of msDNA by a 
hypothetical enzyme [15].  Furthermore, the second nucleotide 
thymine (T) was substituted by adenine (A) in the 5'-TAGA-3' 
box of msDNA-Yf79 [11], -St85 [13], -Vc95 [14] and -Vp96 
(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) (Figure 1A-1D).  The 
third nucleotide guanine (G) in the two boxes of all msDNAs is 
conserved (Figure 1A-1E) and indicates the higher efficiency of

cleavage of these msDNAs, because when the guanine (G) at 
the third position change to cytosine (C), the effort of cleavage 
is moderately reduced [15]. In addition to these boxes, the fifth 
nucleotide adenine (A) at the 5' end of DNA part of msDNA-
Yf79 [11] and msDNA-Ec83 [3] (Figure 1A and 1F) may become 
a target, because when this adenine (A) was substituted by any 
pyrimidines, it reduces the overall msDNA accumulation [15]. 
Within conserved nucleotides among all msDNAs (Figure 1)  
the nucleotide cytosine (C) at position 67 of msDNA-Yf79 [11] 
was substituted by thymine (T), and thymine (T) at position 96 
of msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) was 
substituted by cytosine (C) (Figure 1A, 1D). Furthermore, 
msDNA-Ec83 [3] seems to be mutagenic (Figure 1F)  because 
msDNA with any mismatched base pair in their DNA stems 
could be mutagenic [16, 17].  However, other remaining 
msDNAs (Figure 1A-1E) contained no such type of mismatched 
base pairing in their DNA stem structures.

Ec48, P71276). 
 
Evolutionary Relationship of RTs from Pathogenic Bacteria 
To explore the evolution of reverse transcriptases (RTs), the 
phylogenetic analysis was performed among RT amino acid 
sequences.  Result exhibits a fundamental diversity among all 
the reverse transcriptases (RTs) as RT-Yf79 ( Y. frederiksenii) [11] 
is closely related to the RT-Ec83 (E.coli strain 161) [3] rather than 
to the RT-Ec78 ( E.coli strain 110) [12], RT-Vp96 ( V. 
parahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), RT-
Vc95 ( V.cholerae) [14] and RT-St85 ( S.Typhimurium) [13].  RT-
Ec78 ( E.coli strain 110) [12] is closely related to RT-Vp96 ( V. 
parahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) as well 
as RT-Vc95 ( V.cholerae) [14] is closely related to the RT-St85 
(S.Typhimurium) [13] (Figure 2). The msDNA-Ec73 specific RT 
(Enterobacteria phage phiR73) [18] is related to RT-Yf79, -Ec83, -
Ec78, -Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), -Vc95 and 
-St85 [11, 3, 12, 14, 13] . Although RT-Ec83, -Ec78 and -Ec73 [3, 
12, 18]  were from Escherichia species, they spread out from a 
central point (Figure 2).  Similarly, RT-Vc95 [14] and RT-Vp96 
(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpu blished data) were from Vibrio 
species, but they are closely related to RT-St85 [13] and RT-Ec78 
[12], respectively ( Figure 2). It was also observed that the high 
similarity and relatedness of all RTs from Archaea species and 
RT-S.cellulosum (Myxobacteria species) [19] is originated from 
Archaea RTs (Figure 2).  RT ( V. mimicus ) (Shimamoto T, 2003, 
unpublished data) is clos ely related to the RT- S.cellulosum 
(Myxobacteria species) [19] and   RTs from Archaea species 
(Figure 2). In addition, RT (Y.pestis) was descended from RTs of 
V. mimicus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) , S.cellulosum 
[19] and  Archaea species (Figure 2).  The remaining RTs 
(Myxobacteria species) [19] are related to RT-Ec107, -Ec86 and -
Ec67 [20, 21] . Among all RTs (Myxobacteria species) [19], 
especially RTs - M.lichenicola and S.aurantiaca [19] have shown  
higher similarity, as their phylogenetic distance is too low 
(Figure 2).  Surprisingly, all the Eubacteria RTs are diverged 
from the Archaea species (Figure 2). Although RT-Ec48 is from 
E.coli species [22] this enzyme is distantly related with RTs of 
Archaea and Eubacteria species (Figure 2).

Genetic Diversity of msDNA Producing Strains 
The phylogenetic tree based on 16SrRNA sequences of the 
bacteria such as Archaea: Methanosarcina species ( M.acetivorans, 
M.barkeri and M.mazei ) and Eubacteria: Yersinia species 
(Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species ( S.cellulosum, 
M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and M.xanthus); Vibrio 
species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus  and  V.mimicus ); 
S.Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli  K-12 form a 
phylogenetically related clusters or subgroups (Figure 3).  The 
phylogeny tree revealed that four of the five major phylogenetic 
groups produce msDNAs perhaps acquired this ret gene during 
their evolution through vertic al descended rather than 
horizontal transformation. This observation is consistent with 
the hypothesis of   Rice and Lampson (1995) [19]. 
 
Perspectives 
This study manifests that, the ret genes commonly perceived in 
Eubacteria are unique compared with ret genes found in 
Archaea. Eubacteria ret genes of diverse types are probably 
widespread and might be descended from the characteristics of 
the Archaea world. This hypothesis is supported by the 
prevalence of distribution of ret genes, among a wide variety of 
organisms as documented here and in previous reports 
[11, 23]. 
Xiong and Eickbush (1990) also have shown the origin and 
evolution of retro-elements in different organisms based upon 
reverse transcriptase sequences [23]. Though Archaea had been 
grouped with bacteria as prokaryotes (archaebacteria), they 
have an independent evolutionary history. With respect to the 
observation of ret genes in Archaea, the observation suggests 
that the RT enzyme played a role in the evolutionary emergence 
of Eubacteria from Archaea (or vice versa). Furthermore, 
reverse transcriptase (RT) is also frequently found in 
retroviruses like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [7]. 
Now these findings raise questions as to where ret gene 
originates? Why are they so dive rse along with retron elements 
in these organisms? This statement is parallel to the popular 
chicken versus egg puzzles theory.
