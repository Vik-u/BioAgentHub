Abstract
Introduction: Haemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder resulting from a defi-
ciency of factor VIII (FVIII). To date, multiple gene therapies have entered clinical trials
with the goal of providing durable haemostatic protection from a single dose. TAK 754
(BAX 888) is an investigational AAV8-based gene therapy containing a FVIII transgene.
Reduction in CpG motifs was performed to reduce immunogenicity based on prior
observations. Here, we describe the results of the first two cohorts treated with TAK
754.
Aim: To report clinical and translational results of the TAK-754 phase 1/2 AAV gene
therapy study for the treatment of haemophilia A.
Methods: A phase 1/2 single arm open-label dose escalation study of TAK-754 was
performed in participants with severe haemophilia A (NCT03370172). Participants

were monitored for safety events, endogenous FVIII activity and bleeding rates.
Glucocorticoids were implemented to preserve transgene expression. A transcrip-
tomics analysis was performed to evaluate immunogenicity along with additional
post-hoc analyses.
Results: Four participants were dosed in two cohorts. Infusion of TAK 754 was
well-tolerated. All participants developed mild transient transaminase elevation and
subsequent loss of FVIII expression within the first 12 months of treatment despite use
of glucocorticoids. Transcriptomic analysis did not demonstrate significant changes in
immunogenicity signals in peripheral blood. One serious adverse event of hypophos-
phatemia occurred in the second cohort without obvious risk factors.
Conclusions: Sustained FVIII expression remains a challenge in haemophilia A AAV
gene therapy trials. Mechanisms of transgene expression loss require further study as
clinical studies enter long term follow-up periods.

1 INTRODUCTION
Haemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by a
genetic deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Severe haemophilia
A patients require lifelong treatment with prophylactic FVIII replace-
ment or other haemostatic therapies to prevent serious bleeding
in joints and other tissues.1–3 With the development of gene ther-
apy technology based on the adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs)
for gene transfer, sustained FVIII expression and bleed prevention
has been achieved after a single dose.4,5 As the clinical experi-
ence with gene therapy has evolved, different patterns of FVIII
activity have been observed. Some patients have achieved a mild
haemophilia phenotype that provides protection from most spon-
taneous bleeding but does not fully normalize FVIII expression.
While some gene therapies have achieved high initial FVIII expres-
sion followed by significant loss of expression that have required
resumption of prophylaxis,5,6 others have demonstrated a lower ini-
tial peak with more persistent long-term expression.7–9 Challenges
in achieving stable and durable multi-year FVIII transgene expres-
sion have been attributed to differences in capsid potency, trans-
gene immunogenicity, the unfolded protein response, and promoter
sensitivity.10
TAK-754 (BAX 888) was developed as a gene therapy for
haemophilia A based on an AAV 2/8 capsid with a B-domain deleted
codon optimized factor VIII transgene (FVIII-SQ) produced in HEK293
cells under the control of a liver specific promoter. In addition, CpG
reduction of the transgene cassette was performed to avoid triggering
the innate immune response that has previously been associated
with loss of expression in a haemophilia B gene therapy with the
same capsid.11 Here, we present the results of four participants
with haemophilia A treated with TAK-754 in a first-in-human study
(NCT03370172).
2 METHODS
TAK-754 consists of a recombinant adenovirus-associated virus 2/8
(AAV2/8) produced in HEK293 cells to deliver a single stranded
codon-optimized B-domain-deleted (BDD) factor VIII (FVIII; FVIII-
SQ12) transgene with a liver-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter
with flanking AAV2-derived inverted terminal repeats (Figure1A).
2.1 Study population
Male participants ages 18–75 years with severe haemophilia A (FVIII
activity < 1%) were eligible for enrolment if they had an annual-
ized bleeding rate (ABR) of≥3 or were using FVIII prophylaxis and
had at least 150 exposure days to FVIII concentrates. Key exclu-
sion criteria were a history of inhibitors to FVIII (defined as a tit-
ter of ≥.6 Bethesda units) and the presence of AAV8 neutralizing
antibodies based on a titer cutoff of≥1:5. Participants could not
have a known hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids since prednisolone
was planned as an immunosuppression treatment. Participants were
excluded if there was evidence of hepatic inflammation defined by ALT
or AST > 1x upper limit of normal (ULN) of the reference lab, total
bilirubin > 1.5xULN and direct bilirubin> .5 mg/dl, fibrosis Metavir
stage F2 or greater based on liver biopsy or FibroSURE testing with a
serum albumin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) and alkaline phos-
phatase > 2.0 x ULN. Participants were also screened for HIV, hepatitis
B, hepatitis C, and autoimmune hepatitis.
2.2 Study conduct
This study planned for up to three dose escalation cohorts in an open-
label single arm design. Dosing was performed in the outpatient setting

with sentinel dosing and a minimum of 24 h between each sequential
participant. Two participants were dosed per cohort, and up to five par-
ticipants could be dosed in a single cohort based on achieving target
safety and activity levels.
Dose escalation was based on week 4 FVIII activity levels. If FVIII
activity remained <2% at week 4, then dose escalation to the next
cohort was triggered. If at least one participant achieved a FVIII activ-
ity ≥2%, the decision to escalate or expand the cohort was based on
FVIII activity at week 14. If week 14 FVIII activity levels≥30% were
not achieved, then escalation to the next cohort was triggered after
review with the data monitoring committee. If FVIII levels of≥30%
were observed in at least one of the two participants in a cohort by
week 14, then the cohort was expanded.
Per protocol, if participants exhibited a transaminase elevation of
threefold compared to baseline values, glucocorticoids were adminis-
tered at a starting dose of 60 mg for 4 weeks, followed by a tapering
schedule based on twice-weekly AST, ALT, and FVIII activity values.
After a protocol amendment, the fourth participant received pred-
nisolone on a prophylactic schedule starting at 60 mg 8 days after
the study drug was administered for 4 weeks, and subsequently
tapered over 12 weeks. If transaminase elevation occurred again or
loss of FVIII expression occurred, prednisolone was re-escalated. Pred-
nisolone dosing and tapering schedule was based on autoimmune
hepatitis consensus recommendations.13
Safety and dose determination were the primary endpoints of
this phase 1/2 trial. Adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout
the study and 5-year follow-up period. The CTCAE grading sys-
tem was used for AE and serious (S)AE collection. Vector shedding
was collected as per previous protocols.11 Efficacy was based on
assessments of circulating FVIII activity by one stage assay, FVIII
antigen levels, annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), and the use of exoge-
nous FVIII. Three ascending dose cohorts were planned (2× 1012,
6 × 1012 and 1.2 × 1013 capsid particles (cp)/kg). Capsid particles
were used as dosing units based on internal release assay perfor-
mance and alignment with regulators. Dose ranges were similar to
the more conventional vector genomes per kilogram (vg/kg) values,
with an approximate correlation of 1:1. The transgene used in this
study was codon-optimized and CpG-reduced by>90% based on prior
observations linking CpG motifs with innate immune signalling and
subsequent loss of transgene expression.11 This study was approved
by local ethics committees, and all participants provided informed
consent.
CHAPIN ET AL. 111
Neutralizing antibody assays based on in vitro transduction inhi-
bition were performed as previously described.11,14 Briefly, Serial
two-fold dilutions of participant serum were mixed 1:1 with AAV-
luciferase and incubated for 2 h at 37◦C and then used to infect
Huh7 in tissue culture. Following 24 h, luciferin was added, and
luciferase activity was quantified by luminometer. The highest dilution
of the participant’s serum that resulted in inhibition of≥50% of
luciferase activity compared with control was recorded as the NAb
titter.
Cell mediated immunity was measured using the ELISpot assay as
previously described.11,14 IFN-γ ELISpot assays for AAV and FVIII-
BDD antigen T-cell responses were evaluated using peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A library of 15-mer peptides overlap-
ping by 10 amino acids in sequence was generated to span the entire
proteins of interest were organized into three pools. Plates were
coated with human IFN-γ coating antibody in sterile PBS, washed, and
blocked with complete media. Fresh PBMCs from study participants
were adjusted to a concentration of 2× 10 cells/mL in lymphocyte
culture medium and added to wells. After 18–24 h of stimulation
at 37◦C, plates were washed and incubated with human anti-IFN-γ
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) followed by incubation with Avidin-HRP
and subsequent incubation with AEC chromogenic reagent. Human
IFN-γ activation counts were quantified using the AID ELISpot Reader.
ELISpot sample collection occurred at screening, weekly for weeks 1–
2, twice weekly from weeks 3–14, weekly from weeks 15–8, at months
5, 6, 12 and at the end of study.
2.3 Bulk mRNA transcriptomics analysis
To investigate loss of FVIII expression, bulk mRNA transcriptomic anal-
ysis was performed on PBMCs. Whole blood samples from three con-
sented participants were collected at pre-infusion, 8 h post-infusion,
study weeks 1–14, and months 4, 5, 6, 9 and 12. Healthy volun-
teer controls samples were purchased from StemCell Technologies.
Whole blood samples were collected in PAXGene tubes and stored at
−80◦C. Total RNA was extracted with the miRNA Mini Kit. Prepara-
tion included total RNA extraction, depletion of haemoglobin mRNA,
and construction of bulk mRNAseq libraries followed by sequencing.
Equal amounts of six individually indexed cDNA libraries were pooled
for clustering in an Illumina cBot system flow cell at a concentration
of 8 pM using Illumina’s TruSeq SR Cluster Kit V3 and sequenced
for 100 cycles using a TruSeq SBS kit on the Illumina HiSeq system.
Each sample generated approximately 50 million sequencing reads.
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and exported to fastq files using
CASAVA 1.8 software. Data analysis was performed using OmicSoft
ArraySuite software, version 10.2.3.10 and R, version 3.6.1. Reads
were aligned to the reference genome using the OSA4 algorithm in
OmicSoft. Expressed genes were filtered using default parameters in
filterByExpr15 and counts normalized using the trimmed mean of M
(TMM), both methods in edgeR (version 3.26.8).16
The TMM for the expressed genes were further used for Princi-
pal Com-ponent Analysis (PCA) using the PCAtools library (version
2.6.0; removing lower 1% of genes by variance) to check the overall
variance of each sample. Pathways were enriched for differentially
expressed genes based on literature review of immune responses to
AAV injections in vivo. Genes involved in each pathway were curated
according to the IPA software package (Qiagen). Analysis was per-
formed comparing the time course of each participant and comparing
participants against healthy controls. As this was a safety analysis
driven by a specific hypothesis related to immune reactions described
against AAV, no formal pathway enrichment analysis was conducted.
Gene clustering was performed using custom-written R programs (R
code team Version 3.3.2). Gene clusters were visualized in GraphPad
Prism 8.2.1 (FigureS1).
Additional computational and genome wide association analyses
were conducted to investigate potential risk factors of hypophos-
phatemia including calculation of a polygenic risk score (seeSupple-
mental Methods).
Study sample size was chosen to provide sufficient evidence of
safety and exploration of signs of efficacy for this indication and
was not based on formal statistical considerations. Descriptive sta-
tistical analyses were performed. Continuous variables were summa-
rized using mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, median,
and other percentiles as appropriate. Categorical variables includ-
ing adverse events were summarized using frequency counts and
percentages.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Participants
Between 2017 and 2021, four participants were enrolled and received
an intravenous infusion of TAK-754 in the first two dose cohorts
(Figure 1B–E). All four participants were 18 or older and receiving
prophylaxis with FVIII concentrates. Baseline ABRs were 0–2. No
participants were positive for cross-reactive material (CRIM). Two par-
ticipants had intron 22 inversion mutations, one participant had a
Gln429Ter exon 9 mutation, and one had an Ala1877Pro exon 17 muta-
tion. No participant was positive for HIV, active viral hepatitis B or C, or
autoimmune hepatitis.
3.2 Primary efficacy
After dosing, peak FVIII activities of 3.8% and 11% (cohort 1) and
54.7% and 69.4% (cohort 2) were observed between weeks 4 and 9
(Figure 1B–E). All participants developed minor transaminase eleva-
tions and received corticosteroids for periods of 13 –36 weeks.
Initial tapering of glucocorticoids was initiated per protocol as
described above but was re-escalated in the setting of either increas-
ing transaminase levels or a decline in FVIII activity. Participant four
received corticosteroid prophylaxis beginning 8 days after TAK-754
infusion after a protocol amendment, as described above (Figure1E).
Although each participant experienced temporary protection from

bleeding and was able to discontinue FVIII replacement, sustained
expression was not observed, and enrolment was discontinued prior to
dosing in the third cohort. All participants have resumed therapeutic
haemostatic treatments.
3.3 Safety
Transient transaminase elevation and glucocorticoid-related adverse
events constituted the majority of adverse events (Table1). No infu-
sion reactions, FVIII inhibitors, thrombosis, or malignancies were
observed during the study period. All participants underwent annual
screening with liver ultrasound and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP).
No significant pathology was seen on repeated ultrasounds, and AFP
levels remained within the normal ranges of the local lab in all
participants.
One serious adverse event of asymptomatic hypophosphatemia
was reported 4 weeks after infusion of the study drug. This partici-
pant required inpatient monitoring on multiple occasions and received
both oral and intravenous phosphate supplementation (Figure2A).
Importantly, hypophosphatemia persisted despite tapering from pred-
nisolone. Clinical evaluation did not yield an underlying diagnosis
of hyperparathyroidism, bone disease, nutritional deficiency, intesti-
nal malabsorption or genetic risk of hypophosphatemia (Figure2B).
Additional computational and genome wide association analyses were
conducted to investigate potential risk factors of hypophosphatemia.
No supporting evidence linking this adverse event to the drug’s
mechanism of action (FVIII expression), modality (AAV gene therapy),
co-medication (e.g. prednisolone) or to know genetic factors was found
(Figure 2B and Supplemental Methods).
To evaluate an undiagnosed genetic predisposition to hypophos-
phatemia, a polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated using data from
the United Kingdom Biobank database (UKBB) as described inSup-
plemental Methods. Using 107,445 variants associated with the blood
phosphate levels by genome wide association studies (GWAS), the risk
score was created and trained on a database of 316,973 unrelated
UKBB samples with known blood phosphate levels. Participant 4’s PRS
was lower than PRS of controls and was not the sole explanatory factor
for the occurrence of the hypophosphatemia adverse event, effectively
ruling out an undiagnosed genetic disorder (Figure2C).
3.4 Immunogenicity investigations
Although ELISpot assays did not correspond with loss of FVIII trans-
gene expression or transaminase elevation in this study, positive
responses against the AAV capsid were detected at various time points
for all four participants (FigureS2). Serum cytokine analysis of IL-6 and
TNF-α performed at the time of TAK-754 infusion remained within the
normal ranges for all participants (TableS1).
3.5 Transcriptomics
To evaluate immune mediated loss of FVIII expression, a transcrip-
tomics analysis was conducted.
RNA Seq bulk mRNA transcriptomics were analysed for activation
of MyD88-TLR, anti-viral cytokine and innate immunity signals, canon-
ical and non-canonical NF-kB signals, dendritic cells, STING-C-GAS and
T cell populations (FigureS3A–F).
∙ MyD88-TLR: Within 2 h, a transient increase in type I IFNs, TLR9,

4 DISCUSSION
TAK-754 (BAX888) was based on an AAV8 capsid with a B-domain
deleted codon-optimized FVIII transgene under the control of a liver
specific promoter. Despite significant reduction in CpG content,
loss of transgene expression was observed in all participants and
could not be mitigated with early initiation or prophylactic use of
high dose glucocorticoids. While the investigational product was
well-tolerated, the four study participants have resumed haemostatic
treatments and enrolment has been discontinued. The cause of FVIII
expression decline in this study remains unclear. No participants
were receiving hepatotoxic medication, and all participants had
adequate liver function without evidence of viral or autoimmune
hepatitis.
Durable multi-year expression of peak FVIII activity remains a sig-
nificant challenge in haemophilia A gene therapy to date.4,5,7,17 Study
participants achieved a robust elevation in FVIII activity in the sec-
ond dose cohort accompanied by short term protection from bleeding.
However, transgene expression was not sustained. The kinetics of FVIII
expression in this study differ from other trials in some respects. Fac-
tor VIII activity did not exceed supraphysiologic levels upon initial
transduction and loss of FVIII expression was essentially absolute by
the end of the first year irrespective of glucocorticoid use. In some
gene therapy studies, supraphysiologic FVIII activity is followed by loss
of peak expression within the first 12 months, followed by a slower
decline.5,6,18 However, other studies have shown a lower initial peak
FVIII expression followed by relatively stable FVIII expression after
the first year, usually in the mild haemophilia range (FVIII activity
5%–30%).7–9 Significant reductions in bleeding and haemostatic treat-
ments have been observed in all trials, confirming bleed protection
does not require full normalization of FVIII circulating activity after
gene therapy treatment.
The immunogenicity of the gene therapy components (capsid and
transgene), cell mediated immunity targeting hepatocytes, activation
of an unfolded protein response from endoplasmic reticulum stress,
and transcriptional gene silencing have all been proposed as contribut-
ing to loss of vector derived FVIII expression.17,19 The biphasic pattern
of FVIII loss observed in some trials has been hypothesized to be
related to a shift in either the cell population expressing the trans-
gene or a shift in cellular expression from the episome to an integrated
functional transgene. Cell mediated loss of transduced hepatocytes
is recognized to occur and lead to loss of transgene expression.20,21
Whether hepatocytes with higher vector copy numbers (VCNs) are
lost early in the post-treatment period while cells with lower VCNs
are less vulnerable to cell mediated immunity remains unclear. Simi-
larly, episomal stability impacts transgene expression, and it has been
proposed that long term expression may be the result of integra-
tion of full-length transgenes into the host genome. Greig et al have
demonstrated that gene expression with the AAV delivery platform
in non-human primates can recapitulate these clinical trial observa-
tions, where expression is initially driven by episomal translation and
then by integrated transgenes.22 However, clinical and in vivo stud-
ies of AAV have also demonstrated the persistence of episomes but
only low levels of transgene integration.17,23 Furthermore, Integration
of full-length vector transgenes was not observed in long term canine
studies, confirming that sustained episomally driven FVIII expression
for over a decade is possible in a biologic context.24 The persistence
of episomes is also in line with the patient biopsy data reported by
Fong and colleagues.17 It should be noted that the current study did
not achieve a supraphysiologic peak FVIII expression in any partici-
pants, thus whether a higher dose of TAK-754 would have achieved a
higher peak FVIII activity expression pattern or prolonged steady state
expression remains unanswered.
The immunogenicity of the TAK-754 transgene was potentially a
contributing factor to loss of expression, however a large amount
of preclinical optimization and protocol design features were imple-
mented to avoid innate triggers of immunogenicity. Codon optimiza-
tion of TAK-754 resulted in >90% reduction in CpG motifs, the
presumptive cause of loss of expression in the BAX 335 trial.11 While
the contribution of the remaining CpG motifs cannot be ruled out,
a robust innate immune response seems unlikely. Transaminase ele-
vation and loss of vector expression is driven by multiple upstream
factors. The loss of transgene expression may have the same observ-
able presentation, but different underlying mechanisms compared to
the BAX 335 trial. Indeed, clinical trials have demonstrated significant
differences in patterns of FVIII and factor IX (FIX) expression25 that are
likely related to the different properties of the coagulation factors.

Immunosuppression with high dose glucocorticoids was incorpo-
rated into the study protocol but had little discernible effect on the
loss of expression, consistent with many clinical observations in the
field.4,5,7,26 Participants in this study and others have received mul-
tiple courses of glucocorticoids as transaminase expression and FVIII
expression change.5 We did observe a mild increase in FVIII activity in
some participants after the escalation of glucocorticoids. An additional
loss of FVIII expression upon discontinuing glucocorticoids has been
observed by others. For example, the SPK-8011 multi-year follow-up
showed a loss of FVIII expression as some participants were weaned
from glucocorticoids, and this is attributed to a glucocorticoid respon-
sive element in the promoter.7 TAK-754’s promoter sequence does not
contain a steroid-responsive element.
Zhang et al. evaluated the effect of chronic glucocorticoid treat-
ment after valoctocogene roxaparvovec exposure in a murine model
of haemophilia A.27 Daily prednisolone exposure for 13 weeks did
not alter FVIII DNA, RNA or expression in the liver, or protein distri-
bution in the liver. In the absence of a steroid responsive promoter,
glucocorticoid exposure did not impact FVIII expression kinetics.
However, chronic blockade of cell mediated immunity can pre-
vent loss of transgene expression. Butterfield and colleagues observed
that FVIII expression loss can be blocked by IL-15 blockade in vivo
by preventing T and NK cell activation.28 Importantly, transgene
expression could be preserved specifically by CD8+T cell suppres-
sion without altering mRNA transgene or vector copy number in
the hepatocytes. Furthermore, the use of dexamethasone in mice
has resulted in transient increase in transgene expression that may
be related to immunomodulatory cytokines as opposed to a direct
effect on transcription.29 More research is needed to understand this
phenomenon, although long term immunosuppression with glucocorti-
coids or other therapies is not likely to be acceptable in the haemophilia
population.
Widely used conventional markers of cell mediated immunity
(ELISpot and transaminase elevation) did not correlate with loss of
expression in this study, and this limitation has been observed by
others.26 We undertook an exploratory transcriptomics analysis to
determine if immunogenicity signals could be detected in peripheral
blood. No significant changes in NK cells, NF-kB, IL-6, TLRs 1–8, den-
dritic cell activity, or T cell pathway signals were observed. Small
transient increases in TLR9, TNF-α, CCL5, and IRF7 signals occurred
8 h after infusion without activating a Type 1 IFN response or any clin-
ical observations. These responses are likely associated with transient
AAV infusion.
While we did not detect a significant immune response in circulating
cells, bulk RNA Seq is limited compared to single cell transcriptomics
and cannot identify discrete cell populations. However, the PBMCs
are enriched in lymphocytes and are a source of immunogenic gene
expression. Recently, Xue et al used a more sensitive single cell RNA
transcriptomics analysis in a trial of haemophilia B patients treated
with a FIX gene therapy and a novel AAV capsid.30 With this approach,
the investigators were able to demonstrate the effect of glucocorticoid
prophylaxis on reducing cytotoxic T cells and antigen presenting cells.
Participants with elevated markers of cell mediated immunity also had
suboptimal responses to FIX gene therapy. To date, clinical trials have
not identified reliable assays to predict immunogenicity or loss of FVIII
expression and are limited to detection of a signal in peripheral blood.
Our observations here and by others would suggest the absence of
a significant immunologic response in circulation. Therefore, current
peripheral blood biomarkers have limited value for clinical decision-
making and are subject to high levels of intra-patient variability. AAV
has a relatively low immunogenicity profile in peripheral circulation
compared to a tissue-resident cell response and in theory highlights the
value of assaying the target tissue (hepatocytes) directly.31 To date, this
type of invasive procedure has not been widely conducted and is not
likely to be acceptable for routine use. While the United States Medical
and Scientific Advisory Counsil (MASAC) suggests that liver biopsies
could be performed in trials on a voluntary basis to inform future
studies,32 it will be important to identify better circulating biomark-
ers of immunogenicity that predict loss of transgene expression in
haemophilia A. Future studies with single cell RNA transcriptomics may
help in this effort.
Alternative explanations for the loss of FVIII expression include an
exaggerated unfolded protein response against the modified FVIII-
BDD, which has been observed in some preclinical models,33 but not in
human liver biopsies.17 No liver biopsies were performed in this clinical
study, and the current evidence does not suggest that the unfolded
protein response plays a major role in loss of expression of FVIII. Indi-
vidual patient-specific responses may be determined by alterations
in transcriptional pathway components related to the transgene,
promoter, and histone acetylation, all of which require further study.17
The role of epigenetic changes has recently been identified as a deter-
minant of interspecies variability in gene expression and could play
an as-yet uncharacterized role in interindividual variability in clinical
trials.34
One unusual adverse event (severe hypophosphatemia) was
observed in this study. Although this is not a recognized side effect
of AAV gene therapies, it has been observed in at least one other
trial in a rare metabolic disease.35 The participant in our study had
a protracted recurrent course of hypophosphatemia with the need
for intravenous phosphate administration despite the absence of
known genetic and clinical risk factors. A polygenic risk score, used to
describe the contributions of multiple genes to ascertain risk, did not
suggest that this participant was at higher risk for hypophosphatemia
compared to a reference control population. The pathophysiology of
acute liver disease has been associated with significant hypophos-
phatemia and renal phosphorus loss via the proximal convoluted
tubules,36 and although this participant’s transaminase elevation did
not approach the threshold for acute liver failure, AAV exposure at
high titters remains a source of hepatic inflammation. The hepatic
regulation of phosphate is an area of active research and our observa-
tions highlight the consideration of phosphate monitoring after AAV
treatment.
After reports of a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in another study,
this protocol was amended to include annual liver ultrasounds and
serum AFP levels.37 These studies remained normal in all participants
during multi-year follow-up.
116 CHAPIN ET AL.
There are now several marketed haemophilia gene therapy prod-
ucts, despite a lack of clear understanding of many of the observa-
tions from this study across the field. It is encouraging that many
haemophilia patients have achieved long term bleeding protection
after receiving AAV-based gene therapies, but the factors associated
with poor responses require more study. In addition, despite a very
favourable safety profile to-date, a full understanding of therapeutic
AAV exposure remains incomplete. Long term post-marketing experi-
ence and follow-up of trial participants will be key to understanding
durability, safety and long-term efficacy that will inform the next
generation of gene therapies for haemophilia A.
