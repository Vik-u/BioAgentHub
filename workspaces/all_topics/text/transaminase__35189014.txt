Phenyl-2-Butanol into either (S)- or (R)-Corresponding

The synthesis of enantiopure chiral amines from racemic
alcohols is a key transformation in the chemical industry, e. g.,
in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
However, this reaction remains challenging. In this work, we
propose a one-pot enzymatic cascade for the direct conversion
of a racemic alcohol into either (S)- or (R)-enantiomers of the
corresponding amine, with in-situ cofactor recycling. This
enzymatic cascade consists of two enantio-complementary
alcohol dehydrogenases, both NADH and NADPH oxidase for in-
situ recycling of NAD(P)
+
cofactors, and either (S)- or (R)-
enantioselective transaminase. This cell-free biocatalytic system
has been successfully applied to the conversion of racemic 4-
phenyl-2-butanol into the high value (S)- or (R)-enantiomers of
the amine reaching good (73 % (S)) and excellent (> 99 % (R))
enantioselectivities.
Chiral amines are essential building blocks for the pharmaceut-
ical industry,
[1]
as they are key intermediates in the synthesis of
a plethora of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
[2]
The
industrial synthesis of chiral amines is mainly developed
through metal-catalysed processes, which mostly require tran-
sition metal complexes.
[3]
During the last decades, biocatalysis emerged as a prom-
inent sustainable alternative to metal-catalysis in organic
chemical synthesis, and nowadays, the enantioselective syn-
thesis of chiral amines by isolated enzymes encompasses a
central role in industrial biocatalysis.
[2]
The first examples of
application of isolated enzymes to the production of chiral
amines were developed via kinetic resolution of racemic amines
by lipases
[4]
and dynamic kinetic resolution.
[5–8]
In addition, the
direct synthesis of enantiopure amines from prochiral ketones
catalysed by enzymes has also been developed, mainly using
amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) and ω-transaminases (TAs).
The former enzymes catalyse the reductive amination of
prochiral ketones into chiral amines with the addition of the
cofactor NAD(P)H and ammonia, thus producing water as the
only by-product when the cofactor is regenerated in the
reaction.
[3,9–12]
TAs catalyse the transamination of prochiral
ketones by using an excess of an amine donor, usually
isopropylamine.
[2,13–18]
Although several equivalents of sacrificial
amino donors are needed to drive the equilibrium to product
formation, the use of TAs provides the additional benefit of
producing either the (S)- or the (R)- enantiomers of the amine,
as both (S)- and (R)-enantioselective TAs have been described.
[19]
Moreover, several engineered TAs have already proved to be
excellent catalysts for the production of complex enantiopure
amines.
[19–21]
In contrast to the asymmetric synthesis of amines from
ketone precursors, the direct amination of alcohols offers
advantages, since the alcohol is generally more easily
accessible.
[22]
In fact, different metal-catalysed approaches have
been proposed to this end.
[23]
In this context, the biocatalytic
amination of alcohols to synthesize chiral amines using
enzymatic cascades have also been reported. These reactions
involve a two-step process: alcohol oxidation to form a carbonyl
group, followed by reductive amination to produce a primary
amine. The use of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for alcohol
oxidation and AmDH for the reductive amination step is
attractive, since, in principle, the only by-product is water, and
established the hydrogen-borrowing concept. Several examples
of these redox-neutral enzymatic cascades have been carried
out for the asymmetric amination of alcohols.
[3,10,11,24]
On the
other hand, TAs have also been successfully applied in the
amination step of cascade reactions to synthesize chiral amines.
Remarkably, with this strategy, the production of both
enantiomers of a broad range of chiral amines has been
achieved.
[25–30]
The conversion of easily available racemic alcohols to
enantiopure chiral amines would be of course ideal. However,
this reaction remains challenging in the pharmaceutical
industry as the oxidation of both alcohol enantiomers is
required in the first step.

proposed for the non-enantioselective oxidation of the
alcohol,
[27–30]
however, the use of two enantio-complementary
ADHs in a biocatalytic approach is appealing.
[25,26]
ADH-
mediated oxidation of alcohols would require stoichiometric
amounts of NAD(P)
+
cofactors, unless this is regenerated in-situ
to ensure the sustainability of the process. In cascades involving
ADHs-TAs for the asymmetric synthesis of amines from racemic
alcohols, the use of water-forming NAD(P)H oxidases (NOX) is
an interesting approach. This strategy only requires oxygen and
generates water as the only by-product, and it has been shown
to enhance the alcohol oxidation step in these enzyme
systems.
[25,28,31]
In this work, we have developed a one-pot enzyme cascade
for the asymmetric synthesis of one aromatic amine from the
corresponding racemic secondary alcohol. The system involves
two enantio-complementary ADHs with broad substrate scope,
NOX for the in-situ recycling of NAD(P)
+
cofactor, and either (S)-
or (R)-selective TA. The potential of this enzyme cascade was
investigated, adopting as a case study the conversion of the
racemic alcohol 4-phenyl-2-butanol into the high value (S)- and
(R)-enantiopure aromatic amines, since the cell-free enzymatic
synthesis of both enantiomers of this amine in a tunable fashion
has not been satisfactory. The optimized enzyme cascade
provides an alternative for the biosynthesis of chiral amines
from racemic alcohols, and to put steps forward in the
applicability of biocatalysis in the pharmaceutical industry.
The (S)-selective horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH)
has been identified for this work as one of the two enantio-
complementary ADHs. Since the 1980s, HLADH has been
successfully applied to redox reactions showing excellent
enantioselective properties.
[32–35]
The coupling of HLADH with
the water-forming NOX from Lactobacillus pentosus for in-situ
recycling of the oxidized NAD
+
cofactor has shown to even
enhance the overall reaction performance.
[31]
Then, the (R)-
selective ADH from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH) was chosen as
the second oxidative enzyme, since it shows both excellent
enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope.
[3,36,37]
However,
LbADH is NADP
+
dependent, and a highly efficient NADPH
oxidase (TPNOX), engineered from Lactobacillus brevis NOX was
selected as recycling partner.
[38]
For the amination step, we
explored the suitability of the wild-type (S)-selective TA from
Halomonas elongata (HEWT),
[39–41]
and the (R)-selective thermo-
tolerant TA from Thermomyces stellatus (TsRTA).
[42,43]
Both, HEWT
and TsRTA accept isopropylamine (IPA) as amino donor
resulting in high molar conversions (m.c.).
[31,42]
This one-pot
enzymatic cascade was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of
4-phenylbutan-2-amine from the corresponding racemic alcohol
(Scheme 1).
At 10 mM substrate concentration, the molar conversion
(m.c.) of racemic 4-phenyl-2-butanol to either (S)- or (R)-
enantiomer of the amine were modest but encouraging: 49 %
and 24 %, respectively, with good to excellent enantiomeric
excess (ee) (71 % (S) and > 99 % (R)). The m.c. were lower at a
higher substrate concentration (50 mM) with both, HEWT and
TsRTA (Table 1). In addition, it was confirmed that both ADHs
catalyse the oxidation of this racemic secondary alcohol with
excellent enantioselectivities (Table S1).
According to the observed product distribution at different
time points (Figure S1), the alcohol was oxidised at a faster rate
than the following amination step. Therefore, the amino donor
system in the synthesis of both, (S)- and (R)-4-phenylbutan-2-
amine, was further optimized. In the application of HEWT to the
biocatalytic amination of 4-phenyl-2-butanone, the use of 10
equivalents (eq.) of IPA rather than 2 eq., and a higher enzyme
concentration (1 mg mL
  1
), increased the m.c. from 54 % to 75 %
at 10 mM scale, and from 42 % to 66 % at 50 mM scale (Table 2).

In parallel, for the synthesis of (R)-4-phenylbutan-2-amine
catalysed by TsRTA, the same conditions, pushed the m.c. to
53 % at 10 mM scale, while at 50 mM substrate concentration,
the highest m.c., 10 %, was obtained with 5 eq. of IPA (Table 3).
Despite these improvements, the m.c. in the TsRTA
catalysed reaction was still low for the implementation of this
enzymatic cascade for the synthesis of the (R)-amine and further
optimization of the concentration of TsRTA was carried out. At
5 mg mL
  1
of biocatalyst, 58 % and 20 % m.c. were achieved at
10 mM and 50 mM scales, respectively (Table 4).
The enzymatic cascade consisting of HLADH-LbADH-LpNOX-
TPNOX and either HEWT or TsRTA, with optimised reaction
conditions in the amination step, was then applied to the
synthesis of the (S)- or (R)-enantiomers of the target amine
(Table 5). In the synthesis of (R)-4-phenylbutan-2-amine from
racemic alcohol, 61 % and 35 % m.c. were respectively achieved
at 10 mM and 50 mM substrate concentrations, with excellent
enantioselectivity (> 99 % ee) which nicely compares with the
system developed by Mutti and co-workers which established
an enzymatic cascade formed by two enantiocomplementary
ADHs, AmDH, NADPH oxidase, catalase and formate dehydro-
genase, albeit such system yielded complete conversion of the
same substrate.
[44]
The lower m.c. obtained in the present work
might be due to operational stability issues of TsRTA, but
engineering of this enzyme was recently reported to yield a
more stable variant.
[42]
The synthesis of (S)-4-phenylbutan-2-amine at 50 mM was
obtained with very good m.c. (67 %), and this value compares
to a previously reported cascade which, however, required the
optically pure (S)-alcohol and generated both alanine and
lactate.
[25]
In addition, Li and co-workers developed a novel
simple system containing only ADH, TA and IPA for the
amination of racemic alcohol to produce (S)- amine.
[28]
However,
they applied this enzymatic cascade only in-vivo, and the
whole-cell yielded the (S)-amine with 88 % m.c. and > 99 % ee.
In this work, we described a cell-free biocatalytic system for
the tunable conversion of racemic 4-phenyl-2-butanol into
either (S)- or (R)-enantiomers of 4-phenylbutan-2-amine. These
high value enantiomers of the aromatic amine were synthesized
in one-pot with good (73 % (S)) and excellent (> 99 % (R))
enantioselectivities from the corresponding racemic alcohol. To
improve further on the applicability of this one-pot enzymatic
cascade to the synthesis of (R)-4-phenylbutan-2-amine, engi-
neering TsRTA for improved operational stability might be an
interesting approach. In addition, this work represents the first
example of synthesis of (S)-4-phenylbutan-2-amine from the
racemic alcohol using isolated enzymes with good conversion
and the highest ee reported up to date. Thus, this work provides
a biocatalytic system as an alternative for the direct synthesis of
chiral amines from racemic alcohols and contributes to further
expand the toolbox of biocatalysis for its application to the
pharmaceutical industry. As an outlook, the immobilisation of
the biocatalysts and the translation of the reaction to a
continuous flow set up would make the process even more
efficient.
