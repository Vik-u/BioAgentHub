Abstract
This study aimed to examine the protective role of nebivolol (NEB) on liver tissue against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
induced sepsis model in rats by targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–related binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip), 
CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (Chop) signaling pathways. Four groups, each comprising eight rats, 
were established: control, LPS, LPS + NEB, and NEB. Biochemical analyses included total oxidant status (TOS), serum 
aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Additionally, genetic assessments involved Chop 
and Bip/GRP78 mRNA expression levels, while histopathological examinations were conducted. Immunohistochemistry 
was used to determine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 β) and caspase-3 levels. The LPS group exhibited significantly higher AST, 
ALT, oxidative stress index, and TOS levels compared to the control group. Moreover, the LPS group demonstrated markedly 
increased Chop and Bip/ GRP78 mRNA expression compared to the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the 
LPS group revealed significant upregulation in IL-1β and caspase-3 expressions compared to the control group. Addition-
ally, the LPS group showed significant hyperemia, mild hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltrations. Comparatively, 
the LPS+NEB group exhibited a reversal of these alterations when compared to the LPS group. Collectively, our findings, 
suggest that NEB holds promise as a treatment in conditions where oxidative damage, inflammation, and ER stress–related 
apoptosis play significant roles in the pathogenesis.

Introduction
Sepsis, an inflammatory response throughout the body 
triggered by infection, can progress to septic shock and 
multi-organ dysfunction, leading to severe complications 
with high morbidity rates. These complications encompass 
metabolic disorders, including impaired glucose homeosta-
sis, increased energy consumption, and a negative nitrogen 
balance (Iwashyna et al. 2012). The liver, owing to its pivotal 
functions in synthesis, detoxification, energy production, and 
storage, plays a crucial role in combatting sepsis, a condition 
characterized by severe inflammation (Woźnica et al. 2018).
The liver serves a crucial role in eliminating lipopolysac-
charide (LPS) from systemic circulation. LPS, a component 
found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, con-
tributes to inflammation triggered by bacterial infections 
(Deng et al. 2013). LPS exposure can induce lipid peroxi-
dation and oxidative damage in specific DNA segments and 
other proteins, primarily through the generation of reactive 
Key points
• LPS administration increases the expression of Chop, Bip/
GRP78, IL-1β, and caspase-3 in the rat liver.
• NEB was demonstrated to effectively mitigate LPS-mediated 
liver injury by targeting ER stress, oxidative stress, and apoptotic 
processes.

oxygen species (ROS), like superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, 
and hydrogen peroxide (Brenner et al. 2013). Further -
more, an elevation in metabolic factors, such as cytokines 
and hormones, during various pathological processes has 
been shown to provoke oxidative stress, further disrupting 
metabolic functions and intensifying inflammation. Nota-
bly, levels of ROS and intracellular calcium 
 (Ca2+) signals 
play critical roles as messengers in the intricate relationship 
between oxidative stress and inflammation (Zhang 2010).
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria 
engage in close interaction within a dynamic network, gen-
erating ROS and 
 Ca2+ signals (Zhang and Kaufman 2008). 
The ER plays a pivotal role in various metabolic activities 
such as protein synthesis and transport, protein quality con-
trol, glycosylation, and intracellular 
 Ca2+ homeostasis (Urra 
et al. 2013). External stressors affecting ER 
 Ca2+ homeosta-
sis can initiate “ER stress” leading to the accumulation of 
improperly folded proteins within the cell (Liu et al. 2011). 
Additionally, inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) can induce 
an acute-phase response in the liver, triggering ER stress in 
hepatocytes (Zhang 2010). These cytokines generate 
 Ca2+ 
signals in the ER and heighten ROS accumulation through 
multiple mitochondrial metabolic pathways (Zhang 2010). 
Increased cytosolic calcium levels can accelerate mitochon-
drial metabolism, elevating ROS production. Mitochondrial 
ROS, in turn, can prompt increased calcium release from the 
ER, leading to harmful ROS accumulation (Zhang 2010). To 
counteract ROS-induced damage, the antioxidant defense 
system works to mitigate cellular damage. ER stress is 
closely associated with oxidative stress and the inflamma-
tory response. Dysfunctions in any of these pathways can 
affect others, thus influencing cellular adaptations (Zhang 
and Kaufman 2008; Zhang 2010). Furthermore, studies have 
demonstrated that LPS, a potent inducer of bacterial infec-
tion–triggered inflammation, induces oxidative stress in liver 
tissue and instigates apoptotic processes related to ER stress 
(Zhang and Kaufman 2008; Zhang 2010).
Understanding the intricate connection between ER 
stress and mitochondrial dynamics underscores their piv -
otal roles in cellular homeostasis and determining cell fate. 
ER stress significantly influences mitochondrial function, 
and conversely, both organelles interconnect through various 
signaling pathways. Different stimuli can trigger ER stress 
known to culminate in apoptotic cell death across multiple 
cell types due to its prolonged duration (Liu et al. 2011). 
Moreover, ER stress escalation elevates levels of binding 
immunoglobulin protein (Bip), the primary ER chaperone 
protein. Among the key pro-apoptotic transcription factors in 
ER stress is the Chop protein, a member of the DNA binding 
transcription factor family (Liu et al. 2011; Malhi and Kauf-
man 2011; Kopp et al. 2019). Activated Chop phosphoryl-
ates BH3 proteins situated on the mitochondrial membrane, 
part of the Bcl2 protein family, thereby suppressing the anti-
apoptotic activities of Bcl2 or Bcl-XL. Furthermore, Chop  
plays a dual role in ER stress by inhibiting apoptosis directly, 
leading to an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio (Nasiri-Ansari et al. 
2021).
Nebivolol (NEB) stands as a long-acting, third-genera -
tion β1 adrenergic blocker, exhibiting distinct pharmacody-
namic properties from other beta-blockers in its class. NEB 
showcases vasodilatory and antioxidative effects observed 
in animal models and human studies (Kamp et al. 2010; 
Refaie et al. 2018). Studies suggest that NEB’s antioxidant 
effects are linked to reduced ROS levels produced by the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) 
oxidase enzyme system. The significant antioxidant proper-
ties of NEB and its metabolites have garnered interest for 
potential clinical applications in disorders affecting various 
systems, especially the cardiovascular system (Munzel and 
Gori 2009).
This study aims to evaluate the effects of NEB on vari-
ous pathways in liver tissue, including ER stress, oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and apoptotic processes, utilizing a rat 
model of LPS-induced sepsis.
Materials and methods
Animals and ethical approval
All the experiments were conducted following the guidelines 
for animal research as per the Animal Research: Report-
ing in Live Experiments (ARRIVE 2.0) guidelines and 
received approval from the Local Committee on Animal 
Research of Suleyman Demirel University (approval num-
ber: 11.09.2020-06/18).
A total of 32 Wistar albino rats, weighing between 250 
and 350 g, were utilized in this study. Before commencing 
the experiment, a veterinarian conducted health assessments 
on the rats to ensure their well-being. They were provided 
with a standard commercial diet (Korkuteli Yem, Antalya, 
Turkey) and housed in an environment maintaining a 12:12-
hour light/dark cycle, with a constant temperature ranging 
between 21 and 22 °C and a humidity level between 60 and 
65%. No death was observed throughout the experimental 
period.
Experimental design
Four groups were randomly assigned: control (n  = 8), LPS 
(n = 8), LPS + NEB (n = 8), and NEB (n = 8).
(a)
 Contr
ol group: The rats received 1 ml of saline by oral 
gavage for 3 days. Thirty minutes after the last oral 
5900 Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology (2024) 397:5899–5907
saline administration, 1 ml of saline was injected intra-
peritoneally (i.p.) into the right inguinal area.
(b)
 LPS g
roup: After 3 days of administering 1 ml of saline 
by oral gavage, rats were injected i.p. with 5 mg/kg LPS 
(048K4126, Sigma Aldrich, USA) dissolved in saline 
into the right inguinal area, 30 min after the last oral 
saline (Samuvel et al. 2016).
(c)
 LPS + NEB g
roup: The rats received NEB (Nexivol, 
Abdi İbrahim, Isparta, Turkey) by oral gavage at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg for 3 days, diluted with saline. Thirty min-
utes after the final oral NEB administration, 5 mg/kg 
LPS was injected i.p. into the right inguinal region 
(Dursun et al. 2018).
(d)
 NEB g
roup: The rats were orally administered 10 mg/kg 
NEB for 3 days. Thirty minutes following the last oral 
NEB administration, 1 ml of saline was injected i.p.
Six hours following LPS injection, all rats were anesthe-
tized with 80-100 mg/kg ketamine (Ketasol, Richter Pharma 
AG, Austria) and 8-10 mg/kg xylazine solution (Xylazine-
bio, Bioveta, Czech Republic). Subsequently, blood samples 
were taken from the rats’ inferior vena cava via abdomen 
incisions following the administration of anesthesia. Half 
of the excised liver tissues were wrapped in aluminum foil 
and frozen at −
 20 °C f
or further analysis. The remaining 
hepatic tissues were harvested for histological and immu-
nohistochemical and fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution.
Biochemical testing
Analysis of blood parameters
The rat blood was collected into gel-filled tubes and centri-
fuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain serum. After centrif-
ugation, the serum was divided into three parts and stored at 
−
 80 °C until anal
ysis. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were analyzed 
spectrophotometrically using a suitable kit and a Beckman 
Coulter AU 5800 autoanalyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA).
Parameters for measuring oxidative stress
The Ultra Turrax Janke&Kunkel T-25 homogenizer (IKA®-
Werke, Germany) was used to homogenize hepatic tissue 
samples for oxidant-antioxidant analyses. Commercial kits 
(Rel Assay Diagnostics, Gaziantep, Turkey) and spectropho-
tometry (Beckman Coulter, USA) were used to assess total 
antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS). The 
formula OSI = TOS/TAS was used to compute the oxidative 
stress index (OSI) (Altindag et al. 2008). The antioxidant 
effect of the sample against potent free radical reactions of 
hydroxyl radicals was calculated by measuring the change in 
absorbance at 660 nm. The data are reported in millimolar 
equivalents of Trolox per liter (Erel 2004). Using hydrogen 
peroxide, the test was calibrated, and the finding was repre-
sented in micromolar equivalents of hydrogen peroxide per 
liter (μmol 
 H2O2 Eqv/L) (Erel 2005).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription‑quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis 
protocol
RNA was extracted with the AurumTM Total RNA Mini 
Kit Reagent Monarch Total RNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Using a MySPEC microvol-
ume spectrophotometer (VWR), RNA concentration and 
purity were measured. Using the iScript cDNA Synthesis 
Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), a microgram of 
RNA was translated into cDNA according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix 
was used to conduct RT-PCR amplification (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories, Hercules, CA). Primers to be used for amplification 
were designed through the NCBI website (Table 1). For each 
PCR, triplicate cDNA samples were analyzed. The GAPDH 
gene was utilized to standardize the data. The following PCR 
conditions were used: 5 min of denaturation at 95 °C, fol-
lowed by 40 cycles of 12 s at 95 °C and 35 s at 60 °C. Total 
reaction volume was 25 µl, and 100 ng of cDNA served as 
the template. The comparative 
 2−ΔΔCt method was employed 
to quantify relative gene expression. The melting curve was

and the findings were shown as a fold change.
Histopathological examination
The collected liver samples were fixed in a 10% neutral for-
malin solution. After fixation, tissue samples were routinely 
processed using fully automated tissue processing equipment 
(Leica ASP300S, Wetzlar, Germany) and embedded in the par-
affin wax. After cooling, 5-µm-thick sections were cut from 
paraffin blocks with a rotary microtome (Leica RM2155, Leica 
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The prepared slides were 
examined under a light microscope after being stained with 
hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Histopathological evaluation was con-
ducted on a total of 4 liver sections from each rat.
A semi-quantitative grading system was used to iden-
tify the progression of the injury based on a scale of 0–3, 
whereby 0 indicates no discernible injury, 1 slight immune 
cell infiltration, 2 hepatocyte ballooning/degeneration, and 3 
loss of hepatic structure, increased apoptotic bodies/massive 
immune cell infiltration (Chen et al. 2012).
Immunohistochemical assessment
Two series of sections were taken from each block and sub-
jected to immunohistochemical staining for caspase-3 (Cas-3 
(E-8):sc-7272) and IL-1β (IL-1 β (11E5):sc-52012) (Santa 
Cruz, Texas, USA) expression using the streptavidin-biotin 
technique. Immunohistochemistry involved the application of 
a biotinylated secondary antibody and a streptavidin-alkaline 
phosphatase conjugate on sections treated with primary anti-
bodies for 60 min. The EXPOSE Mouse and Rabbit Specific 
HRP/DAB Detection IHC Kit (ab80436) (Abcam, Cambridge, 
UK) served as the secondary antibody, with diaminobenzidine 
(DAB) as the chromogen. Negative controls utilized an antigen 
dilution solution instead of primary antibodies.
A semi-quantitative analysis utilizing a grading scale from 0 
to 3 assessed cell immunohistochemistry reactivity with mark-
ers: 0, negative; 1, focal weak; 2, diffuse weak; 3, diffuse strong. 
For immunohistochemical examination, slides were analyzed 
independently for each antibody. In each four sections, 10 dis-
tinct areas were evaluated using ImageJ (National Institutes of 
Health, Bethesda MD). The Database Manual Cell Sens Life 
Science Imaging Software System performed microphotogra-
phy (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). The grading of the slides for 
both histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations 
was performed by a researcher who was unaware of the sample 
group identities from another university.
Statistical analyses
Biochemical, genetic, histopathological, and immunohisto-
chemical data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA). The data were examined across groups 
using post hoc One-way ANOVA and LSD testing. The mean 
± standard deviations (SD) of the variables were reported. 
The significance threshold was deemed to be p < 0.05.

Normal liver histology was observed in the control and 
NEB groups during histological evaluation. Conversely, 
the LPS group displayed increased hyperemia, slight 
hemorrhages, hepatocyte degeneration, and inflammatory 
cell infiltrations, predominantly comprising neutrophil 
leukocytes. However, a reduction in these pathological 
findings was evident in the LPS+NEB group (Fig.  2).

Discussion
This experimental model of sepsis demonstrates that LPS 
administration increases the expression of Chop, Bip/
GRP78, IL-1β, and caspase-3 in the rat liver. Notably, NEB 
treatment ameliorated LPS-induced liver injury and reversed 
the increase in AST, ALT, oxidative stress index, and TOS 
levels.
In systemic inflammatory diseases with multi-organ 
involvement, such as sepsis, progressive damage occurs 
in various tissues, including vital elimination organs such 
as the liver and kidneys. These damages give rise to many 
challenges in patient management, including metabolic 
dysfunction and excretory issues. In addition to oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, the autophagy process 
and ER stress mechanism, which are crucial for maintain-
ing cellular homeostasis, contribute significantly to tissue 
damage. Numerous studies have revealed that these dam-
age mechanisms can trigger one other (Liu et al. 2011 ; 
Zhang 2010). For example, ROS-induced oxidative stress 
can activate various intracellular pathways, leading to 
inflammation, and inflammatory cytokines, such as nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-KB), can increase cell nucleus–medi-
ated cas-3 synthesis, driving apoptosis. Additionally, 
excessive ER stress has been demonstrated to promote 
cas-3-mediated apoptosis through calpains (Morishima 
et al. 2002; Rathnasamy et al. 2014).
The parallel increase in oxidant substances and liver 
enzyme levels observed in this study supports these rela-
tionships. The liver, functioning as the body’s detoxifica-
tion center, is exposed to high levels of oxidant substances. 
Under oxidative stress conditions, there is an increased 
consumption of antioxidant enzymes, which are essential 
defense mechanisms against the increased oxidative 
effects. Importantly, this hypothesis is further supported 
by the decrease in TAS levels in the injury group. A study 
assessing NEB treatment in rats with ischemia-reperfusion 
injury also found lower TAS levels in the injury group 
compared to the control and NEB treatment groups (Altun-
kaynak-Camca and Yazihan 2021). The increased TAS 
levels in the treatment group suggest that NEB decreases 
damage by increasing antioxidant enzyme production.
In the clinical evaluations of liver tissue damage, 
parameters like AST and ALT are commonly assessed, 
reflecting oxidative stress as a primary pathophysiological 
mechanism. Consistent with the findings of previous stud -
ies, rats in the LPS group exhibited a significant increase 
in serum AST and ALT levels, yet NEB treatment notably 
decreased these markers (Rofaeil et al. 2017; Ulger et al. 
2015).
Inflammation, a crucial contributor to tissue damage, 
can be incited by heightened ROS levels or other cellular 
pathways (Soliman et al. 2019). This study investigated the 
impact of inhibiting ER stress, a distinct pathway, on inflam-
matory and apoptotic responses in the tissues. The reduc-
tion in IL-1β, an acute-phase reactant commonly used to 
monitor this response, following NEB administration in the 
injury group, signifies the drug’s anti-inflammatory effect. 
This observation aligns with decreased histopathologic signs 
like hyperemia, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infil-
tration in the tissues. Moreover, in a study examining the 
protective role of NEB in cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity 
through various pathways, the NEB treatment was observed 
to mitigate hepatocellular damage (Refaie et al. 2018).
Basal ER stress is crucial for maintaining cellular homeo-
stasis. However, exceeding the ER’s capacity or disruptions 
in the protein quality control mechanism can impact other 
cellular stress processes. Elevated levels of Chop, a pro-
apoptotic transcription factor, and Bip protein, a renowned 
ER chaperone, are directly linked to ER stress (Zhao and 
Ackerman 2006). Prolonged elevation in these protein

levels can trigger apoptosis via an increase in Cas-3 levels, 
a pro-apoptotic protein, mediated by calpain, an essential 
 Ca2+-dependent protein (Liu et al. 2016). The present study 
demonstrated significant increases in the levels of Chop  
and Bip mRNA and strong immunohistochemical staining 
of cas-3 in the LPS-induced damage group, indicating the 
development of ER stress–mediated apoptosis in response to 
LPS-induced tissue damage. Consistent with the literature, 
analyses also revealed increased Chop mRNA and protein 
levels in inflammatory groups experiencing LPS-induced 
tissue damage (Esposito et al. 2013; Nakayama et al. 2010). 
Importantly, NEB treatment significantly mitigated apoptotic 
findings in the LPS groups, suggesting that NEB reverses 
LPS-induced ER stress. Moreover, the impact of the Chop  
gene may activate the internal mitochondrial pathway, lead-
ing to apoptosis. NEB’s inhibition of this pathway might 
also prevent mitochondrial stress. Other beta-blockers like 
carvedilol, propranolol, and atenolol have demonstrated ER 
stress alleviation in human coronary artery endothelial cells 
and hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cells, reducing endothelial 
cell ER and oxidative stress, potentially contributing to their 
hepatoprotective effects (Haas et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2018).
Conclusion
This study successfully established an LPS-induced sepsis 
model in rats and demonstrated the effective mitigation 
of LPS-induced liver injury by NEB, a long-acting, third-
generation beta-blocker targeting ER stress, oxidative 
stress, and apoptotic processes. Our findings significantly 
contribute to the existing literature, given the limited 
research on the relationship between NEB and ER stress. 
Considering, the implications of oxidative stress and ER 
in various disorders’ pathogenesis, this study suggests the 
promising therapeutic potential of NEB. However, future 
investigations exploring NEB’s potential protective impact 
against mitochondrial stress under similar pathological 
conditions would be beneficial.
