ABSTRACT: The discovery and engineering of novel biocatalysts
capable of depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have
gained significant attention since the need for green technologies
to combat plastic pollution has become increasingly urgent. This
study focuses on the development of novel substrates that can
indicate enzymes with PET hydrolytic activity, streamlining the
process of enzyme evaluation and selection. Four novel substrates,
mimicking the structure of PET, were chemically synthesized and
labeled with fluorogenic or chromogenic moieties, enabling the
direct analysis of candidate enzymes without complex preparatory
or analysis steps. The fluorogenic substrates, mUPET1, mUPET2,
and mUPET3, not only identify enzymes capable of PET
breakdown but also differentiate those with exceptional perform-
ance on the polymer, such as the benchmark PETase, LCC
ICCG
. Among the substrates, the chromogenic p-NPhPET3 stands out as a
reliable tool for screening both pure and crude enzymes, offering advantages over fluorogenic substrates such as ease of assay using
UV−vis spectroscopy and compatibility with crude enzyme samples. However, ferulic acid esterases and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate esterases (MHETases), which exhibit remarkably high affinity for PET oligomers, also show high catalytic activity on
these substrates. The substrates introduced in this study hold significant value in the function-based screening and characterization of
enzymes that degrade PET, as well as the the potential to be used in screening mutant libraries derived from directed evolution
experiments. Following this approach, a rapid and dependable assay method can be carried out using basic laboratory infrastructure,
eliminating the necessity for intricate preparatory procedures before analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Plastic pollution is a global problem that poses significant harm
to the environment due to the nonbiodegradable nature of
plastics. These materials can persist in the environment for
hundreds of years, leading to the accumulation of plastic waste
in landfills, oceans, and other ecosystems.
1,2
Additionally, they
can break down into microplastics, which are prone to
ingestion by marine organisms and subsequently enter the
food chain, posing potential risks to human health.
1,3,4
In
recent years, there has been growing interest in developing
sustainable solutions for managing plastic waste, including
enzymatic degradation and recycling. Enzymes can be
employed to break down plastic waste into its constituent
monomers, facilitating the creation of a circular economy.
5
This approach offers several advantages over conventional
disposal methods, such as incineration or landfill, which
introduce secondary pollutants into the environment.
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is among the most
commonly used plastics, finding applications in various fields,
from food packaging to textiles. PET waste is a significant
contributor to plastic pollution, emphasizing the importance of
effective PET-degrading enzymes in reducing plastic waste.
6
PETases have demonstrated the ability to degrade PET into its
monomers, which can then be repurposed for creating new
(bio)materials or added-value products.
7,8
Despite the
potential of enzymatic degradation of plastic waste, the
discovery and engineering of efficient PETases and other
plastic-degrading enzymes remain significant challenges. A
recent opinion paper emphasized the importance of exploring
new enzyme classes that are able to degrade PET. To enable
the discovery of truly novel enzymes, it is essential to employ
model substrates that facilitate their rapid identification and

characterization, allowing efficient comparisons of their
efficiencies.

PETase activity is most commonly assayed on PET as a
substrate in various forms, such as amorphous
10,11
or
semicrystalline
12
PET films or fibers,
13
with subsequent
quantification of the degradation products using high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Although this method is
accurate, it is unable to detect oligomers and has limitations in
terms of speed, throughput, and ease of setup for the
continuous measurement of enzyme kinetics. To enable faster
and higher-throughput analyses, alternative spectrophotomet-
ric methods have been developed. For instance, bulk UV
absorbance measurement of the reaction supernatant has been
proposed as a simpler method, but it comes with some
disadvantages: depending on the mode of action of the enzyme
(if it produces monomers or oligomers), the measurements can
be inaccurate and difficult to compare.
14
Alternatively, the
utilization of ketoreductases (KREDs) for the detection of
released ethylene glycol (EG) showed a good correlation to
the HPLC results.
15
Another approach for quantifying PET
degradation products, initially introduced by Ebersbach et al.,
converts products into fluorescent compounds through a
mechanism driven by the iron autoxidation-mediated gen-
eration of free hydroxyl radicals.
16
However, Zurier and
Goddard highlighted that this particular protocol encounters
limitations that arise from the fact that the mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) exhibits a lower
fluorescent extinction coefficient compared to that of
terephthalic acid (TPA),
13
so in a hydrolysis mixture where
both products are present, TPA will contribute mostly to
fluorescence. This discrepancy likely explains why Ebersbach et
al. reported HPLC and fluorescent results solely in terms of
TPA quantity which was measured after PET nanoparticles'
hydrolysis by Tf Cut2 fromThermobifida fuscaKW3.
16
Taking
into account the fact that Tf Cut2 yields mostly MHET when
acting upon PET nanoparticles (MHET accounts for 75% of
the total products),
17
questions are being raised about the
sensitivity of this technique for screening PETases, which
predominantly release MHET. This concern has also been
addressed by Weigert et al., who improved their assay by
adding an MHETase to the mixture to further convert released
MHET into TPA. This additional step has the potential to
amplify fluorescence intensities; however, it is worth noting
that it introduces some complexity into the screening protocol,
which may impact its straightforwardness and simplicity.
18
Despite the aforementioned issues involving product
quantification, synthesis of PET nanoparticles demands highly
corrosive solvents such as hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP),
19
not to mention that there is currently limited information
available regarding their application in metagenome libraries.
Other substrates such as PET microfibers
13
and semicrystalline
PET coating
18
have been also used for high-throughput
applications; however, it should be considered that screening
protocols using those substrates demand long incubation times
(reaching up to 72 h)
13
or high temperatures (more than 60
°C).
19
At the same time, model substrates closely resembling
the PET structure have also been synthesized throughout the
years, with the first being bis(benzoyloxyethyl) terephthalate
(3PET). The activity of enzymes on this substrate was
correlated to their activity on PET fabrics.
20
Similarly, bis(p-
methylbenzoate) (2PET) has been utilized for the develop-
ment of a turbidimetric assay for high-throughput screening of
PET oligomer-hydrolyzing enzymes.
21
Additionally, the syn-
thesis of a set of PET-related substrates, including the PET
dimer, has shown potential for the detection of PETases.
22
However, these model substrates are mostly insoluble in water,
and calculation of kinetic constants on these requires labor-
intensive procedures and compromises the application and
interpretation of data from simple assays.
14
Given the proven usefulness of stable chromogenic and
fluorogenic compounds for straightforward detection of
hydrolytic activities of enzymes and characterization of
biocatalysts, this study aimed to synthesize new labeled
compounds that can be used as substrates for identifying and
characterizing PET-degrading enzymes. These compounds
have been designed to mimic the structure of PET and
contain chromo- or fluorogenic moieties that enable real-time
monitoring of enzyme activity. We evaluated the performance
of the fluorogenic substrates by conducting kinetic studies with
enzymes known for their activity on PET, including the
engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase LCC (ICCG
mutant), IsPETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis, and the polyester-
ase MoPE from Moraxella sp., as well as three enzymes that
cannot degrade PET as negative controls. The results
demonstrated that the fluorescent substrate, mUPET2, can
be a valuable tool for functional screening since it can
differentiate enzymes with activity on PET, while the bulkiest
synthesized substrates (mUPET3) can identify PET-degrading
enzymes with high performance on the polymer. Additionally,
the study explored the limitations associated with using labeled
substrates to assess the activity of enzymes that degrade PET
oligomers. Finally, a chromogenic substrate was synthesized
and utilized as a reliable tool for screening both pure and crude
enzymes. This assay method requires only a simple analytical
infrastructure to evaluate the PET-degrading activity.

Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Virgin PET and Detection of
Degradation Products. Purified enzymes’ ability to break down
PET was determined after mixing 10 mg of amorphous PET powder
with 50 μg of each enzyme in 1 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7,
while in the case of FusIm, the protein amount used for PET
hydrolysis was 7 μg. The reactions were kept under agitation (1200
rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort (Eppendorf, Germany)
at 30 °C for 3 days, and every 24 h, half of the initial amount of each
enzyme was added to the reaction mixture. The degradation products
were detected and quantified in the Agilent 1260 Infinity II
instrument (Agilent Technologies, Germany), using an Agilent 1260
Infinity II variable wavelength detector (VWD) (G7114A), following
the protocol described elsewhere.

Determination of Enzyme Kinetic Constants Using Fluoro-
genic PET Model Substrates. Stock solutions of fluorogenic PET
model substrates (mUPET1, mUPET2, and mUPET3; Figure 2) were
prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mM. Reactions were
conducted in a total volume of 100 μL, using 0.1 M phosphate buffer
at pH 7. Each substrate was mixed with 10 μL of the respective
enzyme, and the necessary amount of DMSO was added to maintain a
final concentration of 5% (v/v). The concentrations of mUPET1,
mUPET2, and mUPET3 ranged from 0 to 30, 50, and 70 μM,
respectively, while the enzyme quantity was varied to obtain a linear
reaction curve for the course of the assay. Control reactions were
performed after replacing the volume of the enzyme solution with an
equal amount of 20 mM Tris−HCl (pH 7.5).
Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 15 min in a Tecan Infinite
M1000 Pro fluorescence microplate reader (Switzerland), equipped
with the analysis software Tecan i-control 1.11. Fluorescence was
recorded every 30 s, setting excitation and emission wavelengths at
380 and 454 nm,
32
respectively. Fluorescence was converted to 4-mU
concentration via a standard curve constructed with pure 4-mU in 0.1
M phosphate buffer, pH 7. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as
the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of 4-mU per min.
The kinetic constants presented in this study were calculated on
GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, Boston, USA). The
experimental values are presented as means ± standard deviation
(SD) of three replicates (n = 3). Statistical tests analyzing the
difference between the means of each independent kinetic constant
were also performed (one-way ANOVA).
Activity Assay with a Chromogenic PET Model Substrate.
Similar to fluorogenic substrates, a 10 mM stock solution of the
chromogenic substrate (p-NPhPET3) (Figure 2D) was prepared in
DMSO. Reactions were initiated after mixing a p-NPhPET3 stock
solution with 20 μL of each enzyme in a total volume of 250 μL of 0.1
M phosphate buffer pH 7 resulting in a dispersion (59 μg of total
substrate amount). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C
under agitation (1300 rpm) in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort
(Eppendorf, Germany) for 15 min. After 15 min, the reaction tubes
were put on ice to minimize enzyme activity and centrifuged at 4000 g
for 30 s. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the release of
p-NPhOH in the reaction supernatant at 410 nm in a SpectaMax ABS
Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices, LLC). A standard curve of
p-NPhOH in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 7 was used to
quantify the release of p-NPhOH in the enzyme reactions. One unit of
enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol
of p-NPhOH per min.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selection of Candidate Enzymes and Their Ability To
Degrade Amorphous PET. The PET-degrading enzymes
used in this study have been previously investigated for PET
degradation, demonstrating varying performance. This obser-
vation facilitates the assessment of labeled substrates for
sorting enzyme candidates based on their PET degradation
ability. More specifically, PET hydrolases LCC
ICCG
, IsPETase,
and MoPe exhibit different performances in PET depolyme-
rization, allowing their correlation with the labeled substrates.
Additionally, FoFaeC is a representative tannase-like FAE
33−35
that can release hydroxycinnamic acids from hemicellulose and
pectin, hydrolyzing the ester bond with L -arabinofuranose-
containing polysaccharides.
36
IsMHETase from I. sakaiensis is
the only known MHET esterase, yielding TPA and ethylene
glycol.
37
Despite the low sequence identity shared between
FoFaeC and IsMHETase (27% for 82% coverage), IsMHETase
also belongs to FAE-like enzymes
38
and is a structural
homologue of FoFaeC with a Z-score of 35.0 and a root-
mean-square deviation of 2.6 Å.
34
FoFaeC was selected as an
intriguing candidate not only because it could be possibly
assayed when conducting functional screening tests for
PETases but also due to this enzyme’s capacity to hydrolyze
PET oligomers yielding TPA.
23
Apart from FoFaeC, enzymes
hydrolyzing natural polymers were also selected in this study,
considering the structural and chemical similarities shared
between natural and synthetic polymers.
39
Glucuronoyl
esterases are carbohydrate esterases that have been reported
to hydrolyze lignin−carbohydrate ester bonds in lignin−
carbohydrate complexes.
40
To the best of our knowledge, these
enzymes have never been tested in synthetic polymer
degradation. On the contrary, lipases have long been reported
to hydrolyze petroleum-based polyesters,
41
exhibiting degrad-
ing activity on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL),
41,42
polyethylene
succinate (PES),
42
and PET fabrics and films.
43
Especially for
the A. niger lipase used in this study, according to Ion et al., this
enzyme acts as a BHETase, hydrolyzing BHET to MHET and
TPA, with the conversion of MHET to TPA being a time- and
enzyme concentration-dependent process.
44
In pursuit of
evaluating a crude enzyme preparation against labeled
substrates, the culture supernatant fromF. oxysporumBPOP18
(FusIm) induced by Impranil DLN-SD was also employed.
All of the above-mentioned enzymes were tested for their
degrading activity on amorphous PET, and the amount of TPA
and MHET released is depicted in Figure 3. Treatment of PET
powder with equivalent amounts of known polyesterases led to
considerable amounts of monomer release approaching 450
mg/mg of enzyme for LCC
ICCG
, while the corresponding
amount in the case of MoPE was almost 300-fold lower.
Conversely, FoFaeC,A. niger lipase, StGE2, and FusIm

demonstrated negligible PET degradation activity, releasing no
more than 0.54 mg of degradation products per mg of enzyme
(Figure 3). These findings will serve as a benchmark for
evaluating the efficacy of the labeled substrates in distinguish-
ing PET hydrolases from general ester-cleaving enzymes while
classifying PET hydrolases based on their performance on the
polymer.
Fluorogenic Model Substrates' Potential for Assaying
PET-Degrading Activity. The kinetic characteristics of the
enzymes mentioned above were determined on the fluorescent
substrates, where the results revealed variations in the catalytic
efficiency (k
cat
/K
M
) among the different PET hydrolases. For
example, in mUPET1 and mUPET2, the catalytic efficiency
ranged from 7.5 to 20.8 M
−1
s
−1
and 4.1 to 9.0 M
−1
s
−1
,
respectively (Figure 4). In contrast, the other esterases
exhibited significantly lower catalytic efficiencies, as the highest
k
cat
/K
M
value was 9-fold lower in mUPET1 and 25-fold lower
in mUPET2 compared to the least efficient PET hydrolase
(Figure 4A,B).
When mUPET3 was used as a substrate, the catalytic
efficiencies determined ranged from 0.06 to 0.6 M
−1
s
−1
, which
were up to 280-fold lower compared to the other fluorescent
substrates (Figure 4C). All enzymes displayed similar k
cat
/K
M
values, except for LCC
ICCG
that exhibited the highest catalytic
efficiency, which was up to 10-fold greater than those of the
other enzymes. This finding suggests that mUPET3 might be
able to differentiate highly efficient PET hydrolases, whereas
enzymes with little or no activity on PET, like StGE2, have
negligible activity on this substrate, which does not allow the
calculation of kinetic constants.
In the context of this study, the turnover number (k
cat
) was
also calculated (Table 1). The k
cat
of IsPETase on mUPET1
was found to be 1.5- and 1.7-fold higher compared to those of
LCC
ICCG
and MoPE, respectively, reaching almost 0.5 × 10
−4
s
−1
. However, a different trend was observed for mUPET2,
since the k
cat
of MoPE was up to 2.4-fold higher than those of
LCC
ICCG
and IsPETase, whose turnover numbers remained
relatively consistent, as those before. In general, it is important

degradation products were detected in control reactions (absence of
enzymes).

to note that the k
cat
values of enzymes with PET-degrading
activity are at least 34- and 76-fold higher in mUPET1 and
mUPET2, respectively, compared to those of the best-
performing esterase.
Furthermore, when examining mUPET3, LCC
ICCG
exhibited
the maximum k
cat
, which was 4.5- and 13-fold higher than
those of IsPETase and MoPE, respectively (Table 1). This
reaffirms earlier observations regarding the k
cat
/K
M
values
(Figure 4), highlighting the superior catalytic efficiency of
LCC
ICCG
for PET degradation. It is noteworthy that the
determined turnover numbers for this substrate were at least
10-fold lower than those of mUPET1 and mUPET2. The
reduced turnover rates can be attributed to the fact that k
cat
defines the release rate of the fluorescent moiety, and since
mUPET3 contains four ester bonds, the cleavage of that
specific bond has a slower rate.
Regarding the K
M
values, these can be generally described by
the following correlation, K
M(mUPET3)
> K
M(mUPET2)
>
K
M(mUPET1)
(Table 1). This pattern could be the result of the
elevated hydrophobicity when the substrate size increases and/
or the fact that bulkier substrates exhibit greater steric
hindrance leading to reduced enzyme affinity. Based on this
observation, the K
M
values of LCC
ICCG
were significantly
impacted in comparison to their corresponding values in
mUPET1, since its K
M
was increased by 4.5- and 13.4-fold for
the hydrolysis of mUPET2 and mUPET3 substrates,
respectively.
Regarding StGE2 andA. niger lipase, the affinity of the
glucuronoyl esterase was among the highest in mUPET1 and
mUPET2, whereas the affinity ofA. niger lipase was the greatest
in mUPET2 and mUPET3 (Table 1). Although these enzymes
exhibit significantly high affinity for these substrates, probably
due to esterases’ preference for PET oligomers, neither their
catalytic efficiency nor PET powder degradation establishes
them as potential PET degraders. Besides, it is known that
these enzymes can hydrolyze the ester bond within the PET
oligomers without necessarily having the capability to
extensively degrade the PET polymer itself.
45,46
Due to these
reasons, K
M
cannot be considered an indicator that can be
correlated with enzyme performance on PET polymer, so an
enzyme selection should not rely only on this kinetic
parameter.
Considering all of the aforementioned kinetic parameters,
each substrate can give important information, allowing
screening and sorting of the studied enzymes based on their
efficiency. Especially for mUPET1 and mUPET2, these
substrates could identify the enzymes with activity on PET
(Figure 3), as their k
cat
and k
cat
/K
M
values were up to 400- and
137-fold higher than those of the other enzymes tested.
Regarding mUPET3, the corresponding values proved that this
substrate could identify and differentiate highly efficient PET
hydrolases such as LCC
ICCG
, not to mention that the esterases
with imperceptible activity on PET polymer had either low or
no activity on this substrate; a piece of useful evidence as
interference of insufficient hydrolases can be avoided.
Limitations Using Labeled Substrates for Screening
PET Hydrolases. The newly designed and synthesized labeled
substrates have been demonstrated as novel tools for assaying
the PET-degrading activity of characterized enzymes, as they
can rapidly identify PET-degrading candidates and even
differentiate those with high activity on PET. Aiming to
understand any potential limitations that the labeled substrates
would pose, the class of PET oligomer-degrading enzymes was
investigated. This investigation was motivated by a previous
study wherein a novel enzyme called PET46 was discovered
through a sequence-based metagenome search for PETases.
PET46 shares structural similarities with feruloyl esterases and
exhibits the ability to hydrolyze MHET, BHET, and synthetic
PET oligomers, including 3PET. However, its activity on PET
polymer was significantly lower when compared to benchmark
enzymes such as IsPETase and LCC.
47
In this context, we also
assessed the ability of the labeled substrates to differentiate
between FAEs/MHETases and PETases. Similar observations
were also observed in our case, as FoFaeC showed 874-fold, 5-
fold, and 9-fold greater catalytic efficiency on mUPET1,
mUPET2, and mUPET3, respectively, when compared to the

next best-performing enzyme (Tables 1 and 2). The results
obtained in our study demonstrate that FAEs can also generate
false-positive indications, a fact that should be considered
when using mUPET substrates. This limitation may also apply
to MHETases considering the high similarity in mode of action
to FAEs.
The remarkably high catalytic efficiency of FoFaeC
compared to those of the other enzymes tested, alongside
the similar K
M
values found in mUPET substrates despite their
structural diversity, implies a plausible mechanism whereby
FoFaeC preferentially recognizes and cleaves the fluorogenic
moiety of the substrate. To further examine this hypothesis,
FoFaeC was also assayed with 4-mU- and p-NPhOH-
octanoate, which is a substrate specified for measuring lipase
activity. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency determined using
4-mU-octanoate as a substrate was more than 100,000-fold
higher compared to that obtained using p-NPh-octanoate,
although the enzyme should in theory recognize the acyl
moiety of each substrate. Furthermore, the K
M
values of
mUPET1, mUPET3, and 4-mU-octanoate did not exhibit
statistically significant differences, indicating similar substrate
affinities. Similarly, the K
M
of mUPET2 fell within a similar
range, but on the other hand, the K
M
value of p-NPh-octanoate
was significantly higher. All of these findings collectively
indicate that this specific enzyme effectively cleaves the 4-mU
moiety, highlighting the limitations of assaying FAEs/
MHETases, with 4-mU-labeled substrates. Simultaneously,
the much lower affinity and catalytic efficiency of FoFaeC
toward the p-NPhOH moiety is an observation that will be
explored in greater depth within this study, since the utilization
of substrates with alternative labeling may potentially enable
the differentiation between FAEs/MHETases and actual
PETases.
Taking all of the results and limitations into account, it is
noteworthy that fluorescent substrates serve as a valuable tool
for the rapid identification and assessment of enzymes with
PETase activity. Particularly, these labeled substrates are well-
suited for screening mutant libraries or characterizing
engineered PETases, providing valuable insights into enzyme
performance as they can promptly evaluate their activity on
PET. Moreover, these substrates enable determination of
kinetics without the requirement for additional secondary
analyses, thereby making the screening process more efficient.
However, it should be mentioned that the same compounds
are not recommended when screening a metagenomic library
since the possible presence of FAEs/MHETases can result in
false-positive indications, necessitating subsequent tests using
PET polymer.
In addition to quantifying the enzymatic activities of various
4-mU PET analogues, a quick qualitative assay can be
conducted using a 96-well microplate under room temperature
conditions and UV light exposure (Figure S9). However,
attempts to develop an agar-plate-based screening assay
utilizing the 4-mU PET analogues for direct assessment of
an E. coli mutant library were unsuccessful. One possible
explanation for this outcome is the inability of the labeled
substrates to penetrate the intracellular space and undergo
hydrolysis by the recombinantly expressed enzymes. Hence, it
is advisable to utilize an enzyme-secreting expression host for
the establishment of an agar plate assay screening.
Use of a Chromogenic Substrate for PETase Activity
Screening. As shown by the kinetic results, mUPET3 proved
superior in the identification of enzymes with high PET-
degrading activity compared with the other fluorogenic
substrates. Additionally, the reduced binding affinity of FAE
toward the p-NPhOH moiety (Table 2) prompted us to
synthesize a new substrate (p-NPhPET3), akin to mUPET3,
wherein 4-mU was replaced with p-NPhOH as a chromophore
(Figure 1D). The hydrolysis of p-NPhPET3 can be easily
assayed by vis spectroscopy, a fact that makes its use more
laboratory-friendly, not to mention that it is partially insoluble
under assay conditions, resembling the hydrophobic and
insoluble structure of PET.
At this point, another notable benefit of UV/vis spectros-
copy is its capability to assay a broader range of enzyme
preparations, including the microbe’s exoproteome. This
exoproteome (or secretome) is another source for discovering
novel PETases, although screening with fluorescent substrates
is often restrictive according to the principles of fluorescence
microscopy. More specifically, screening crude enzymes
derived from culture supernatants can interfere with a
fluorescent assay, since compounds with significant biological
activity can be fluorescent themselves or act as a quencher.
48
For example, secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids,
contribute the most to background fluorescence interfering
with the fluorescence emission of 4-mU.
49
In the case of
screening whole cells, it should be considered that NADPH
fluorescence wavelength bands (excitation range 320−380 nm
and emission range 420−480 nm) overlap with those of 4-
mU.
48,50
For all the aforementioned reasons, the screening assay
utilizing p-NPhPET3 included not only purified enzymes but
also FusIm, the induced secretome of F. oxysporum, wherein
various enzymes including lipases, cutinases, and carboxypep-
tidases have been identified.
30
These enzymes have putative
PETase activity
5
; therefore, FusIm was also included in our
study and tested with p-NPhPET3. As shown in Figure 5,
FoFaeC could extensively hydrolyze p-NPhPET3 exceeding 13
units/mg enzyme, verifying again the conclusion that FAEs
present particularly high activity on these substrates. Regarding
the other enzymes, the activity of LCC
ICCG
, IsPETase, and
MoPE was approximately 2- to 4-fold higher than that of
Figure 5. Specific activity (units/mg enzyme) of various enzymes on

StGE2, which exhibited the highest activity among A. niger
lipase and FusIm, reaching 0.45 units/mg enzyme. Further-
more, the activity of FusIm showed no statistical difference
compared to StGE2, while the activity of A. niger lipase
fluctuated at the same level, indicating that the p-NPhPET3
substrate could successfully differentiate PET hydrolases from
the ester-cleaving enzymes. However, it is worth noting that
FusIm is a crude enzyme preparation, leading to a lower ratio
of enzymes with actual PETase activity, a fact which potentially
underestimates its ability in PET hydrolysis.
Despite the need for a centrifugation step prior to analysis,
p-NPhPET3 stands out as a useful tool for effectively sorting
enzymes based on their PET-degrading ability and allows the
screening of both pure and crude enzymes obtained from
culture supernatants. Considering the aforementioned limi-
tations, both chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates can be
used not only for determining the activity of putative PETases
but also as screening tools in high-throughput assays for
molecular evolution studies. Also in this case, we observed that
the performance of PET hydrolases mirrors that of real PET,
with LCC
ICCG
emerging as the most efficient candidate for
PET hydrolysis when assessed with the chromogenic substrate.
Regarding other ester-cleaving enzymes, both glucuronoyl
esterase StGe2 andA. niger lipase demonstrate comparable
levels of PET degradation performance and exhibit similar
activity in p-NPhPET3, whereas FusIm displays a minimal
impact on PET degradation despite its activity being
comparable to that of StGe2. This discrepancy may be
attributed to the presence of other enzymes within the induced
secretome, particularly feruloyl esterases, as previously
discussed in a study by Taxeidis et al.
30
Overall, these substrates offer significant advantages in terms
of time efficiency and cost-effectiveness as they can reliably and
directly determine enzymes with PETase activity. Particularly
during enzyme screening, which involves numerous candidates,
the substrates can be inexpensively synthesized, significantly
reducing both the cost and time required compared to HPLC
analysis. Notably, this assay enables kinetic measurements of
up to 96 samples, offering a substantial advantage over HPLC,
which at the same time can only measure a single time point of
one sample.
Moreover, this screening assay demands smaller enzyme
amounts compared to PET degradation studies due to the high
sensitivity of fluorescence, also providing initial insights into
enzyme performance and subsequently reducing reaction times
for PET degradation. Finally, considering the high costs
associated with purchasing and maintaining the HPLC
infrastructure, the economic feasibility of substrate synthesis
becomes even more evident, as this method can eliminate the
large number of samples needed to be measured with liquid
chromatography, further highlighting the advantages of the
assay.
■
CONCLUSIONS
The discovery of new biocatalysts capable of hydrolyzing PET
is currently receiving significant attention, as combating plastic
pollution using environmentally friendly technologies has
emerged as a pressing task for the scientific community. The
labeled substrates exemplified in this study serve as valuable
indicators for enzymes with PET hydrolytic activity, allowing
the identification of PETases with exceptional performance in
PET degradation. Particularly, p-NPhPET3 stands out as a
reliable tool for screening both pure and crude enzymes,
offering a straightforward assay protocol that can be performed
using a simple analytical infrastructure. However, it is
important to exercise caution when using these labeled
substrates to assay FAEs/MHETases, as their strong affinity
for the labeled moiety and PET oligomers can lead to extensive
hydrolysis of the PET-labeled substrates. In summary, the
substrates presented in this study are valuable for function-
based screening and characterization of PET-degrading
enzymes, as well as for high-throughput screening of mutant
libraries in directed evolution experiments. This fast and
reliable assay methodology simplifies the process by using a
simple laboratory infrastructure without the need for complex
preparatory steps prior to analysis.
