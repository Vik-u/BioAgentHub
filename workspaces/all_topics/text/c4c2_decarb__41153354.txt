Abstract
The development of hepatic steatosis in geese is a complex, multistage process involving
genes related to lipid synthesis, transport, storage, and metabolism. Key genes activated
during this process include ME1 (malic enzyme 1), SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), ACSL1
(acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1), and ELOVL6 (elongation of very-
long-chain fatty acids protein 6). The expression of these genes varies depending on the
tissue, breed, and metabolic context. Geese possess a unique ability to develop hepatic
steatosis (fatty liver) without accompanying inflammation or liver damage. This condition
typically arises from overfeeding, either through carbohydrates or fats, leading to significant
triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes. Importantly, this state remains reversible and is
considered non-pathological. The physiological and molecular changes observed in overfed
geese, particularly regarding liver lipid accumulation and serum enzyme activity, closely
resemble those found in human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This similarity
makes geese an excellent biomedical model for studying NAFLD. Overfeeding initiates a
cascade of enzymatic reactions that regulate lipid metabolism at the genetic level. These
reactions decrease circulating free fatty acids and glucose while promoting triglyceride
storage in the liver. The aim of this study is to synthesize current knowledge on the genetic
regulation of fatty acid metabolism in geese, highlighting how these genes coordinate the
processes of activation, desaturation, synthesis, and elongation during induced steatosis.
Moreover, the summarized effects of different diet supplements will enhance goose feeding
strategies for foie gras production.

1. Introduction
Lipogenesis is a key process in the energy storage system in mammals and other
animals, including birds [1,2]. Geese possess a remarkable physiological ability to develop
a fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) without adverse health effects. This condition is typically
induced by excessive high-energy food (carbohydrates or fat) intake and is characterized
by extensive lipid accumulation in the liver. Uniquely, this steatosis is reversible and non-
pathological, distinguishing it from similar conditions in humans and other animals. The
intense hepatic steatosis is similar to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) in humans and other mammals. Similarities in serum enzyme activity changes
and liver lipid deposition mechanisms have been observed in overfed geese and humans or
mammals with NAFLD [3]. As a consequence, goose fatty liver can be used as an excellent
model for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in biomedical research [3,4].

Genes 2025, 16, 1137 2 of 13
This unique metabolic adaptation in geese is thought to be linked to their natural
biology. It is widely believed that this reversible hepatic steatosis is an evolutionary
adaptation linked to the migratory behaviour of geese. During long-distance flights, these
birds must withstand prolonged periods of fasting, requiring efficient lipid storage and
mobilization mechanisms [3].
To investigate the underlying mechanisms of this physiological trait, numerous studies
have investigated changes in gene expression in overfed geese. Goose fatty liver forms
primarily due to an imbalance between fatty acid synthesis, β-oxidation, lipid synthesis,
and lipid transportation in the liver [2]. Overfeeding triggers hepatic steatosis accompanied
by dynamic regulation of lipid metabolism-related genes, including both upregulated and
downregulated factors.
Lipid metabolism plays a crucial biological role in living cells [ 5]. The studies con-
ducted so far have demonstrated that lipid metabolism is crucial for numerous biological
processes, such as reproduction (oocyte maturation and follicular development) [6].
This manuscript summarizes and organizes the systematic knowledge about the ge-
netic background of the metabolism of fatty acids in geese. These genes play crucial
roles in fatty acid activation, desaturation, synthesis, and elongation, and their regulation
reflects the liver’s metabolic adaptation during induced steatosis. Moreover, the summa-
rized effects of different diet supplements will enhance goose feeding strategies for foie
gras production.

3. Liver Fatty Acid Composition and Genetic Response to Different Diet
Supplementation Types
There is a growing epidemic of nutrition-related diseases in highly developed societies.
Excessive consumption of saturated fats is a key factor contributing to elevated blood
cholesterol levels, which, over time, increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as
strokes and heart attacks. Furthermore, a high intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) is
strongly associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [4]. Current dietary guidelines recommend limiting the intake
of SFAs, particularly those found in red meats such as pork and beef. Instead, it is advised to
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 4 of 13
increase the consumption of food rich in monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs). The essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6 are good examples
of PUFAs, as they cannot be synthesized de novo and must be obtained through the
diet. In this context, goose meat and livers, available on the market as foie gras, are the
compelling alternatives. Studies on native Polish goose breeds have shown that goose
meat is notably rich in PUFAs. Specifically, it contains high levels of n-6 fatty acids such as
linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6), arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6), and docosatetraenoic acid (C22:4 n-6),
with concentrations in ranges of 13.20–16.20%, 3.61–7.79%, and 0.55–0.88% of total fatty
acids, respectively. In terms of n-3 fatty acids, the meat contains linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3),
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) at
levels of 0.87–1.63%, 0.58–1.51%, and 0.34–0.44%, respectively [21]. The fatty livers obtained
from Landes geese are rich in MUFAs and PUFAS [3,7] (Fournier et al. 1997, Zhu et al. 2011).
For optimal health, the balance between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids is critical, with an ideal
dietary ratio close to 1:1 [22]. Research on Polish goose breeds indicates that both the n-6:n-3
ratio and the overall fatty acid profile are influenced by rearing conditions, including diet
composition and genetic background [8,10].
The vast majority of research has focused on the alteration of fatty acid composition
induced by overfeeding. Overfeeding is the procedure of providing a goose or duck a hefty
dose of high-energy food (carbohydrates or fat). Under the Council Directive 98/58/EC,
which sets the minimum standards for the welfare of farmed animals, Article 14 stipulates
that animals must be fed in a manner that avoids causing unnecessary suffering. Due to
this legal framework, forced overfeeding of geese and ducks is not commonly practiced
across the majority of European countries. However, it remains legally permitted in France,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain, and Wallonia, a region of Belgium.
France stands out as a global leader in the production of foie gras, which is known
for its exquisite delicacy and unparalleled flavour [ 11]. The French Grey Landes goose
has emerged as the predominant breed, prized for its remarkable ability to accumulate
triglycerides in the liver and effectively increase liver weight [ 3]. In contrast, Asia has
developed a burgeoning market for breeding European-origin Landes geese, signalling a
growing international trend in this industry [12].
The overfeeding results in an excessive amount of energy being provided, inducing
fatty acid alteration. These processes support the reversible, non-pathologic accumulation
of triglycerides in goose liver. In short, it is induced by enhancing membrane flexibility and
lipid storage. All of this is happening simultaneously to limit inflammatory damage [2].
The genetic response to overfeeding is induced differentially depending on the en-
ergy source used. Overfeeding induces the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes;
however, different pathways related to protein transport, hepatocyte proliferation, and
fatty acid composition, including essential fatty acids, are also induced. Feeding geese
with carbohydrates and dietary lipids (oils/fats) triggers distinct metabolic processes in
their livers, even though both lead to hepatic steatosis [ 2,13]. The genetic mechanisms
remain nutritionally modulated, although the fatty acid content differs slightly. A precise
and thorough analysis of the effects of different dietary components in geese allows for
a critical evaluation of fatty acid concentration and composition. This, in turn, enables
improvements in foie gras production methods, encouraging producers to consider not
only performance parameters but also to remain aware of product quality, while ensuring
that geese are maintained in optimal health throughout the fattening process.
A detailed study explored the differences in lipid deposition mechanisms in goose
liver at the individual, transcriptome, and cellular levels by comparing the metabolic
pathways induced by overfeeding with maize [ 7,14], glucose, sucrose, and fructose [ 2].
High-energy carbohydrates are commonly used in livestock production. A higher intake of
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 5 of 13
carbohydrates induces an increase in liver lipids and is positively correlated with de novo
fatty acid synthesis, as it is believed that glucose, fructose, or amino acids are considered
the primary de novo fatty acid synthesis substrates [2,23].
In geese overfed carbohydrates, fructose, glucose, and sucrose, intracellular triglyc-
erides (TGs) increased, and noticeable lipid deposition was observed in the primary hepato-
cytes of the studied geese [2]. The genetic alteration induced by carbohydrate supplementa-
tion is summarized in Table 2. The dietary addition of glucose has a potentially suppressive
effect on hepatic inflammation. In [15], the primary hepatocytes were treated with glucose,
which increased the ubiquitination level of PKA, which are proteins associated with various
chronic diseases, such as NAFLD [15]. Moreover, in the liver tissues of the group treated
with fructose, glucose, and sucrose, the expression of the genes related to fatty acid synthe-
sis (fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCa)) increased. However,
this mechanism was not proven in [ 13]. Interestingly, the expression of FABP1, a gene
related to lipid transport, is decreased in the sucrose groups. In this group, a significantly
higher expression of the PPAR signalling pathway was observed, which stimulates lipid
metabolism and fat cell differentiation. These molecular mechanisms were reflected in the
highest-weight livers in the sucrose overfeeding group [2]. In a later study, overfeeding
with supplementation of 10% fructose did not induce the expression of genes of the key
enzymes involved in hepatocyte fatty acid synthesis and steroid biosynthesis (ELOVL6,
SCD, FASN, and SREBP1) [13]. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms typically activated during
the process of lipid accumulation in the liver, protecting the liver from severe hepatic
steatosis, were also not induced in [ 13]. According to the authors of [ 13], the procedure
of overfeeding with fructose supplementation was maintained for too long. Therefore,
after fat accumulation, the expression of genes involved in hepatocytes’ lipid synthesis
was downregulated, and the lipid accumulation slowed down [ 13]. The natural ability
of waterfowl to accumulate lipids in the liver is, as mentioned, reversible, and effective
anti-inflammatory processes are likely time-limited [13]. Based on previous studies, there
is likely a specific time range in which the anti-inflammatory mechanisms are induced.
This is closely associated with the increase in key genes involved in hepatocyte fatty acid
synthesis and steroid biosynthesis.

The type of sugar added induces changes in fatty acid profiles in the liver. The sugar
addition increased the content and proportion of UFAs (unsaturated fatty acids). The
concentration and the ratio of essential n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were also higher in the sugar
overfed groups [2]. However, the geese overfed with maize flour supplemented with 10%
fructose expressed remarkable liver steatosis [13].
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 6 of 13
In the production of foie gras, the most effective supplementation method involves
sucrose. The addition of sucrose leads to the development of heavier livers, positively
impacting economic returns. Although glucose supplementation induces anti-inflammatory
processes most effectively during short-term overfeeding (for a duration of several weeks),
the non-inflammatory effects of sucrose supplementation will still be adequate.
The studies elucidating the effect of fat (either animal or plant) supplementation on
fat synthesis and triglyceride accumulation in goose liver are in the minority. In [11], geese
in the overfeeding group received an additional dose of plant oil, specifically soybean oil,
goose fat, and a mix of both these fat types. The addition of rapeseed oil and goose fat
was tested by [ 16]. Both groups studied Landes geese. In [ 11], birds were sacrificed at
60 days of life, while in [16], they were sacrificed at 70 days of life. Ref. [ 16] proved that
the concentration of omega-6 PUFAs increased, while the levels of saturated fatty acids
(SFAs) were lower in the group fed with rapeseed oil compared to the goose fat group.
Concentrations of long PUFAs, specifically C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C20:2, and C22:1, were
higher in the rapeseed oil group [16]. There was no statistically significant difference in the
concentration of omega-3 fatty acids between the groups. Notably, the ratio of n-3 to n-6
PUFAs was substantially lower in the fatty liver of both overfed geese relative to that of the
control group [16]. In the study conducted by [11], the type of fat used did not affect the
levels of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or PUFAs, including omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6)
PUFAs. However, the group supplemented with soybean oil had the lowest concentration
of unsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the liver when compared to
the groups receiving goose fat and mixed-fat supplements [11]. The results suggest that
when considering fat supplementation in a goose’s diet, it is more beneficial to choose
rapeseed oil over soybean oil and goose fat. This choice leads to foie gras that is richer in
both omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and long-chain PUFAs. On the other
hand, overfeeding geese with a mixture of goose fat and rapeseed oil is more economically
advantageous, as it results in a higher liver weight. However, it is worth noting that there
is a 10-day difference in the collection time of the studied material, which might impact the
final results obtained.
Several common genes involved in fat metabolism differentiation, as well as oxidative
stress, have been identified as DEGs between the goose fat and rapeseed oil-fed and soybean
oil-fed groups (Table 3). Notably, both studies revealed distinct profiles of significantly
differentially expressed genes between the treatment groups, with the exception of the
SCD gene, which consistently emerged as a commonly regulated target across both studies.
Ref. [16] found that ELOVL1, ELOVL2, and ELOVL3 were downregulated. These genes
belong to the large group of genes involved in fatty acid elongation. ELOVL1 is primarily
involved in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (C20–C26). In
contrast, ELOVL2 plays a significant role in elongating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
particularly by converting C20 and C22 PUFAs into C24 precursors that are necessary for
the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other long-chain PUFAs. Additionally,
the ELOVL3 gene also contributes to the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated
fatty acids. Notably, all of the ELOVL-type genes that were identified are downregulated in
both studied groups, which may suggest that hepatocytes experience a high accumulation
of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) gene was
upregulated with a higher concentration in the group fed goose fat [16]. In the study by [11],
this gene was downregulated, similar to ELOVL6, FASN, and SREBP1. The observed effect
is likely a consequence of the extended overfeeding duration, during which hepatic steatosis
had already been fully established, leading to a downregulation of pathways associated
with fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation. It is compelling that the genetic machinery
related to fatty acid elongation in a group fed with goose fat does not result in a higher
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 7 of 13
concentration of long fatty acids in the livers affected by steatosis. This mechanism is likely
less efficient compared to the transformation of plant oils.

4. Genetic Response to Hepatic Steatosis
The development of hepatic steatosis in geese induced with supplementation with
carbohydrates is a complex, multistage process requiring the involvement of numerous
genes associated with lipid synthesis, packaging, secretion, transport, deposition, and
metabolism [24]. The biosynthesis of fatty acids in goose liver is catalyzed sequentially
by enzymes that are reflected in the activation of key genes during the reversible process
of hepatic steatosis in geese, including ME1 (malic enzyme 1), SCD1, ACSL1 (acyl-CoA
synthetase long-chain family member 1), and ELOVL6 (elongation of very-long-chain fatty
acids protein 6). However, these genes show differential expression patterns depending on
tissue, breed, and metabolic context [1].
Among these, SCD1 is consistently upregulated during overfeeding-induced steatosis
and plays a central role in lipogenesis. SCD1 catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) such as palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) and stearoyl-CoA (C18:0) into their monounsat-
urated counterparts by introducing a cis-double bond at the delta-9 position [24–26]. The
resulting monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) serve as major substrates for the biosyn-
thesis of complex lipids such as triglycerides, phospholipids, wax esters, and cholesterol
esters, and play a critical role in maintaining cell membrane fluidity [24].
Figure 1 presents a schematic overview of the genetic regulation of lipid biosynthesis
in the goose liver under carbohydrate overfeeding.
SCD1 expression is tightly regulated in response to nutritional and hormonal cues
and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes rapid turnover [ 27].
Comparative genomics reveals that the goose genome harbours more than three times as
many SCD gene copies asGallus gallus, Anser cygnoides, or Homo sapiens, which may underlie
its exceptional lipogenic capacity [25]. The expression of SCD1 is known to be promoted by
insulin and inhibited by leptin, influencing triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes [28].
Additionally, SCD1 is regulated by SREBP-1c and can also respond to changes in the levels
of saturated fatty acids [29]. While SCD1 is broadly expressed, it shows the highest levels in
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 8 of 13
liver and adipose tissues and much lower expression in the spleen, where downregulation
may play a protective, anti-inflammatory role post-overfeeding [24,30].
Figure 1. The schematic genetic regulation pathways induced with de novo FA substrates increasing
the formulation of triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters in the goose, induced with
supplementation with carbohydrates; glucose and free fatty acids enter the hepatic cytosol, beginning
glycolysis and providing Acetylo-CoA, an essential substrate for the citric acid cycle, which takes
place in mitochondria; FASN (fatty acid synthase) activity is induced with SREBP1 (sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1); and FASN (belongs to the FAS enzymatic complex) catalyzes the de
novo synthesis of palmitic acid (C16:0) from acetyl-CoA, using NADPH as a reducing equivalent. It
acts as the entry point into the lipid synthesis network, providing saturated fatty acids (SFAs) that
serve as substrates for downstream elongation and desaturation. FASN activity is tightly linked
to ME1; ACSL1 converts free fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, activating them for further
elongation and desaturation or incorporation into TG (lipid storage purposes) and phospholipids
(membrane synthesis). Blue boxes—genes upregulated during overfeeding; ME1—malic enzyme 1;
ACSL1—acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1; SCD1—stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. The
activity of the genes marked with a wide frame is modulated with ACSL1 and SCD1 activity:
ELOVL6 and ELOVL1—elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids protein 6 and 1, respectively; ACAT2
(Acyl-CoA:Cholesterol Acyltransferase 2)—with a dark green colour, marks the cholesterol esters’
synthesis pathway; ELOVL1—light purple colour, marks the phospholipids’ synthesis pathway;
yellow boxes—substrates for glycolysis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and triglyceride
synthesis (created in https://BioRender.com).
SCD belongs to the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) family, which catalyzes critical steps in
the conversion of SFAs to MUFAs (Moltó-Puigmartí et al., 2010) [31]. Osman et al. (2016) [32]
identified FADS1 and FADS2 as protective elements during goose hepatic steatosis, which
were upregulated to meet the immediate demand for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 9 of 13
acids (LC-PUFAs), thereby preventing liver injury. Similarly, Loix et al. (2024) [33] showed
that the steady expression of SCD1 in the hypothalamus helps prevent inflammation caused
by elevated circulating fatty acid levels.
The role of ELOVL6, a long-chain fatty acid elongase, is also crucial in this metabolic
network. It works in conjunction with FAS and SCD1 in the de novo synthesis of saturated
and monounsaturated fatty acids. SREBP1 regulates ELOVL6 expression, and its sustained
activation induces overexpression of nuclear SREBPs in hepatocytes [ 34]. SREBPs exist
in three isoforms—SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2—each governing distinct aspects of
lipid metabolism. SREBP2 is mainly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas SREBP1c
regulates adipogenesis by modulating its transcriptional levels.
In geese, dietary manipulation—especially overfeeding with carbohydrate-rich
diets—is the primary strategy used to induce hepatic steatosis. Glucose and other monosac-
charides act as substrates for de novo lipogenesis and simultaneously stimulate the expres-
sion of ME1, which generates NADPH, a necessary cofactor for fatty acid biosynthesis [7,35].
Unlike mammals, geese heavily rely on NADP+-dependent malic enzyme activity for this
process [36]. The authors of [9] observed significant breed-specific variation in ME1 expres-
sion, with Landes geese showing higher expression compared to the Kielecka and White
Koluda® breeds, suggesting a genetic predisposition toward enhanced lipogenesis in the
Landes breed.
Overfeeding also increases hepatic expression of ACSL1, ELOVL5, and SCD1 [ 7].
ACSL1 activates long-chain fatty acids by converting them into fatty acyl-CoA, which are
then elongated by ELOVL6 and desaturated by SCD1. The ACSL1 and ELOVL6 genes
display intriguing expression patterns. ACSL1 is involved in the uptake and storage of fatty
acids, with its expression significantly increasing during periods of overfeeding. ELOVL6
is also crucial for the elongation of fatty acids while also preventing excessive elongation
that could lead to lipid toxicity in cells [17,37]. The opposing expression patterns of these
two genes help to balance the types of lipids that are synthesized and stored, thereby
preventing the harmful buildup of long-chain saturated fatty acids [17]. This results in the
production of very-long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for membrane
biosynthesis, energy storage, and signalling [7,25]. The authors of [9] also showed higher
ACSL1 expression in Landes geese compared to local Polish breeds, further reinforcing the
notion of genetic specialization for fatty acid metabolism.
In addition to these genes, FASN plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis, being
highly expressed in goose liver and directly controlling fatty acid synthesis [ 12]. FAS
is a multifunctional enzyme complex that catalyzes the terminal steps of de novo fatty
acid synthesis, converting acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into palmitate (C16:0) using
NADPH as a reducing agent. In the goose liver, FAS is highly expressed under overfeeding
conditions—especially with carbohydrate-rich diets—facilitating increased lipid deposi-
tion [12]. The activity of FAS is closely coordinated with upstream genes such as ME1
(malic enzyme 1), which supplies NADPH, and downstream enzymes like ELOVL6 and
SCD1, which elongate and desaturate fatty acid chains. The upregulation of FAS in overfed
geese is essential for hepatic triglyceride synthesis, providing the bulk of saturated fatty
acid substrates required for further elongation and lipid storage (Figure 1).
Other relevant enzymes include ACAT2, involved in cholesterol ester synthesis, and
ELOVL1, which participates in PUFA elongation [32]. ELOVL1, part of the same elongase
family as ELOVL6, plays a complementary role (Figure 1). ELOVL1 plays a pivotal role
in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with 20 to 26 carbon
atoms, generating very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that are crucial for the integrity of
membrane phospholipids, sphingolipids, and lipid signalling molecules. In the context of
hepatic steatosis, ELOVL1 operates downstream of fatty acid synthase (FAS), extending
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 10 of 13
the fatty acid chains initially produced by FAS. This elongation is not just important
but essential for maintaining membrane fluidity and ensuring that cellular organelles
in lipid-rich hepatocytes possess the structural and functional properties necessary for
optimal performance.
Furthermore, research by [12] highlights the critical function of ACAT2 in the ester-
ification of free cholesterol with long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, resulting in the formation of
cholesterol esters (CEs) that are vital for storage and secretion (Figure 1). In overfed goose
liver, the upregulation of ACAT2 is significant, particularly when diets are enriched with
fat-rich components like goose fat or mixed lipids. This underscores the biochemical adap-
tations that occur in response to dietary changes, revealing the intricate balance of lipid
metabolism in the liver [12,32]. These genes are differentially expressed in geese depending
on the type of dietary fat administered, with mixed-fat diets (e.g., plant oil + goose fat)
enhancing expression and promoting greater retention of unsaturated fatty acids [11].
5. Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression Involved in Hepatic Lipid
Biosynthesis in Geese
Epigenetic modifications, i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation
by non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs), play pivotal roles in regulating
gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These modifications allow the goose
liver to adapt flexibly to environmental and nutritional changes during hepatic steatosis.
In geese, understanding epigenetics is particularly relevant because their liver serves as the
central site for lipogenesis, unlike mammals, where adipose tissue dominates fat storage.
Studying these modifications in goose liver is crucial to uncover how reversible hepatic
steatosis is orchestrated at the molecular level and to inform both poultry production and
human NAFLD models [17,18].
Gene activity in goose hepatic lipid metabolism is tightly modulated through several
layers of epigenetic regulation. Ref. [17] developed a microRNA (miRNA) profile in the
livers of geese. They identified differentially expressed miRNAs, predicted their target
genes, and categorized them based on the KEGG pathway analysis. Many of these target
genes are integral to metabolic pathways that contribute to the development of hepatic
steatosis in goose fatty liver. ACSL1 and ELOVL6 are predicted target genes of aan-miR-
203a and aan-miR-125b-5p, respectively. ACSL1 and ELOVL6 exhibited opposite expression
patterns with aan-miR-203a and aan-miR-125b-5p, respectively. These findings suggest
that both types of miRNA regulate hepatic lipid metabolism by targeting ACSL1 and
ELOVL6 [17].
Ref. [19] conducted a comprehensive analysis of miR-29c and its predicted target genes,
including Col3a1, Sgk1, and Insig1, suggesting that miR-29c may play a regulatory role
in energy homeostasis and cell growth. The miR-29c suppression in energy metabolism-
related tissues of overfed geese indicates that miR-29c could be involved in the regulation
of energy balance during the development of fatty liver in geese. Ref. [20] identified over
11,000 circRNAs and nearly 1000 miRNAs in goose liver, with many enriched in lipid
metabolism pathways, such as fatty acid biosynthesis and PPAR signalling. Regulatory
axes such as circRNA1112–miR-27b–target mRNA provide examples of ceRNA mechanisms
modulating gene expression epigenetically during liver development and overfeeding.
Ref. [5] identified over 300 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the goose liver after
overfeeding, with lncRNA XLOC_292762 notably downregulated, suggesting roles in
controlling lipid accumulation and energy balance. Additionally, ref. [38] demonstrated
that methylation of the VNN1 gene, a regulator of coenzyme A synthesis, was modulated
by betaine and 5-azacytidine treatments, thereby influencing lipid synthesis in goose liver.
Genes 2025, 16, 1137 11 of 13
Histone modifications were not directly measured in most of the studies, but tran-
scriptional changes in key metabolic and protective genes (e.g., HSP70, FADS1, and FABP)
suggest upstream epigenetic regulation in response to oxidative stress during hepatic
steatosis in a study conducted on Lion-Head Geese [ 18]. Moreover, it is believed that
there is a coordinated regulation involving mRNA–lncRNA–circRNA networks during
high-energy intake, with key metabolic enzymes like ME1 and PKS under an epigenetic
regulation mechanism [18].
Hepatic steatosis in geese is modulated by a complex interplay of genetic and metabolic
responses, with epigenetic regulators acting as key intermediaries. The miRNA–mRNA
interactions (e.g., miR-125b–ELOVL6), circRNA networks, and DNA methylation effectively
modulate the hepatic lipid profile. Genes such as SCD1, ACSL1, ELOVL6, ME1, and FASN
are not only transcriptionally upregulated during overfeeding but also regulated in post-
transcriptional processes. Interestingly, while hepatic steatosis in mammals often leads to
pathological consequences, in geese, it remains largely non-inflammatory and reversible—a
fact partly attributed to their unique epigenetic responses [5,19].
Non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs, miRNAs, or circRNAs, are promising therapeutic
targets due to their roles in various cellular processes and their disease-specific expression
patterns. The NAFLD-like phenotype in goose liver that develops without inflammation is
promising for the development of therapeutic pathways in humans.
6. Conclusions
Carbohydrate supplementation tends to lower SFAs and increase MUFAs and PUFAs,
suggesting a more favourable fatty acid profile in the liver, which is more preferable for
the human diet. Fat supplementation shows the highest MUFA levels, particularly oleic
acid, and maintains PUFA levels similar to those of controls. The omega-6 and omega-3
levels are relatively stable across all groups, but slightly lower with fat supplementa-
tion. During overfeeding, geese exhibit a coordinated upregulation of lipid metabolic
genes—FASN → ACSL1 → ELOVL6 → SCD1—to drive efficient de novo lipogenesis,
culminating in hepatic fat accumulation. This synchronized enzymatic cascade underpins
the metabolic basis for reversible fatty liver formation in waterfowl.
In the future, foie gras producers will be able to rely on a range of evidence-based
recommendations derived from current research findings. First, the duration of feeding
and the type of dietary supplements used are crucial factors. These elements indicate
to producers that a fatty liver contains a variety of valuable and nutritionally desirable
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Addition-
ally, it is important to determine the optimal feeding period while ensuring the health and
well-being of the birds, particularly by supporting anti-inflammatory processes.
Research on epigenetics and post-transcriptional modifications holds significant po-
tential for advancing therapeutic strategies for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) in humans.
