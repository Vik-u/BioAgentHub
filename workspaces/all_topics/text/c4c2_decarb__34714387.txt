Abstract
Here, we describe a model of  C3,  C3–C4 intermediate, and  C4 photosynthesis that is designed to facilitate quantitative analysis 
of physiological measurements. The model relates the factors limiting electron transport and carbon metabolism, the regula-
tory processes that coordinate these metabolic domains, and the responses to light, carbon dioxide, and temperature. It has 
three unique features. First, mechanistic expressions describe how the cytochrome  b6f complex controls electron transport 
in mesophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts. Second, the coupling between the mesophyll and bundle sheath expressions 
represents how feedback regulation of Cyt  b6f coordinates electron transport and carbon metabolism. Third, the temperature 
sensitivity of Cyt  b6f is differentiated from that of the coupling between NADPH, Fd, and ATP production. Using this model, 
we present simulations demonstrating that the light dependence of the carbon dioxide compensation point in  C3–C4 leaves 
can be explained by co-occurrence of light saturation in the mesophyll and light limitation in the bundle sheath. We also 
present inversions demonstrating that population-level variation in the carbon dioxide compensation point in a Type I  C3–C4 
plant, Flaveria chloraefolia, can be explained by variable allocation of photosynthetic capacity to the bundle sheath. These 
results suggest that Type I  C3–C4 intermediate plants adjust pigment and protein distributions to optimize the glycine shut-
tle under different light and temperature regimes, and that the malate and aspartate shuttles may have originally functioned 
to smooth out the energy supply and demand associated with the glycine shuttle. This model has a wide range of potential 
applications to physiological, ecological, and evolutionary questions.

Introduction
At present, the major patterns in the ecology and evolution 
of  C3 and  C4 plants are attributed to the physiological dif-
ferences between the  C3 and  C4 photosynthetic pathways. 
The foundation for this theory is the observation that the 
two pathways translate into distinct physiological advan-
tages and disadvantages under different environmental con-
ditions (Berry 1975; Ehleringer and Björkman 1977).  C3 
photosynthesis provides advantages over  C4 photosynthesis 
under low light intensities, high carbon dioxide levels, and 
cool temperatures, while  C4 photosynthesis provides advan-
tages over  C3 photosynthesis under high light intensities, 
low carbon dioxide levels, and warm temperatures (Berry 
and Björkman 1980; Berry and Downton 1982; Pearcy and 
Ehleringer 1984). These physiological trade-offs are thought 
to be the basis of the evolutionary rise of  C4 plants in ancient 
environments characterized by lower atmospheric carbon 
dioxide (Monson 1989a; Ehleringer and Monson 1993; 
Ehleringer et al. 1997; Osborne and Beerling 2006; Tipple 
and Pagani 2007; Osborne and Sack 2012). They are also 
thought to be the basis of the ecological dominance of  C4 
plants in modern environments characterized by high light 
intensities, warm temperatures, and a moderate amount of 
warm season precipitation (Ehleringer 1978; Ehleringer and 
Monson 1993; Collatz et al. 1998; Still et al. 2003). How -
ever, it is not yet clear how to reconcile these ideas with the

physiology, ecology, and evolution of plants that use  C3–C4 
intermediate photosynthesis.
On the one hand, a number of lines of evidence suggest 
that  C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis represents an inter -
mediate stage in evolutionary transitions between  C3 and 
 C4 photosynthesis (Kennedy and Laetsch 1974; Christin 
et al. 2011; Sage et al. 2014; Stata et al. 2019; Lyu et al. 
2021). On the other hand, no ecological conditions have 
yet been identified under which  C3–C4 intermediate photo-
synthesis provides  C3–C4 plants with unique physiological 
advantages over  C3 as well as  C4 plants (Monson et al. 1984, 
1986; Peisker 1986; von Caemmerer 1989; Monson 1989a, 
2003; Ehleringer and Monson 1993; Ehleringer et al. 1997; 
Sage et al. 2012, 2018; Heckmann et al. 2013; Christin and 
Osborne 2014; Lundgren and Christin 2017). The simplest 
way to reconcile these observations would be to posit that 
there are some ecological conditions under which  C3–C4 
intermediate photosynthesis can represent an evolutionarily 
stable strategy (Maynard Smith and Price 1973), and the 
exact nature of these conditions simply remains to be eluci-
dated. But this may or may not be the right interpretation. At 
the heart of this puzzle is the question: what are the relative 
advantages and disadvantages of  C3,  C3–C4 intermediate, 
and  C4 photosynthesis?
We submit that to answer this question, it is necessary 
to directly confront the current conceptual models of the 
 C3,  C3–C4 intermediate, and  C4 pathways with experimen-
tal measurements. Towards this end, the objective of this 
paper is to describe a general model of  C3,  C3–C4 interme-
diate, and  C4 photosynthesis that is designed to facilitate 
quantitative analysis of physiological measurements. This 
model uses the approach introduced by Johnson and Berry 
(2021) to describe how the overall photosynthetic responses 
to light, carbon dioxide, and temperature emerge from the 
factors limiting electron transport and carbon metabolism 
and the regulatory processes that coordinate these meta-
bolic domains. In the remainder of the Introduction, we 
review current understanding of  C3,  C4, and  C3–C4 inter-
mediate photosynthesis and outline the philosophy that 
has guided the development of this modeling framework. 
In Model Development we then introduce the key features 
of this framework and in Model Applications we present 
example applications to the interpretation of physiological 
measurements.
The  C3 photosynthetic pathway
The current understanding of  C3 photosynthesis began to 
be assembled more than a century ago. In the early 1900s, 
it was established that  C3 photosynthesis involves the coor-
dinated operation of two metabolic domains with differ -
ent sensitivities to light, carbon dioxide, and temperature 
(Blackman 1905). During the 1910–1920s, it was inferred 
that at low light intensities the overall process is controlled 
by ‘a photochemical reaction’ with low temperature sensi-
tivity, whereas at high light intensities the control shifts to 
a ‘purely chemical reaction’ with much higher temperature 
sensitivity (Emerson 1929). During the 1930–1960s, the 
nature of these processes was pursued. It was shown that 
the metabolic domain in control at low light is the electron 
transport system, and that it operates in two major modes. 
One is a linear electron flow that involves two photochemi-
cal reactions, splits water, and leads to the net production 
of oxygen, Fd, NADPH, and ATP (Duysens et al. 1961). 
The other is a cyclic electron flow that only involves one 
photochemical reaction and leads to the net production of 
ATP (Tagawa et al. 1963). The pigment-protein complexes 
mediating the photochemical reactions are now known as 
Photosystem II (PS II; EC 1.10.3.9) and Photosystem I (PS 
I; EC 1.97.1.12). In parallel, it was shown that the metabolic 
domain in control at high light is carbon metabolism, and 
that it also operates in two major modes: a photosynthetic 
carbon reduction cycle which fixes  CO2 (Calvin and Benson 
1948) and a photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle which 
fixes  O2 (Tregunna et al. 1966). During the late 1960s and 
early 1970s, the sites of the primary rate-limitations were 
identified within both metabolic domains. The primary 
rate-limiting factor within the electron transport system 
was found to be the Cytochrome  b6f complex (Cyt  b6f; EC 
7.1.1.6), which participates in linear as well as cyclic elec-
tron flow (Stiehl and Witt 1969). The primary rate-limiting 
factor within carbon metabolism was found to be Ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 
4.1.1.39), which participates in the photosynthetic carbon 
reduction and oxidation cycles (Ogren and Bowes 1971; 
Bowes et al. 1971; Laing et al. 1974). During the 1980s 
and 1990s, advances were made in identifying the regula-
tory processes that mediate flux in between these limits. It 
was established that under saturating light there is down-
regulation of many of the membrane-bound enzymes in the 
electron transport system, including Cyt  b6f, whereas under 
limiting light there is downregulation of many of the stromal 
enzymes involved in carbon metabolism, including Rubisco 
(Heber et al. 1986; Weis et al. 1987; Harbinson et al. 1990). 
In combination, these insights underpin current conceptual 
understanding of how the  C3 photosynthetic pathway oper-
ates as an integrated system in dynamic environments.
The development of quantitative models of  C3 photo-
synthesis proceeded in parallel with the development of 
conceptual understanding. Initially, the light response of 
photosynthesis was described as having a domain where 
the photosynthetic rate increases linearly with light, and a 
sharp transition to another domain where the  CO2 supply 
becomes limiting (Blackman 1905). A rectangular hyper -
bolic function was then introduced to provide a smoother 
transition from the light-limited and  CO2-limited parts of 
843Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866 
1 3
the response (Rabinowitch 1951). This was eventually sup-
planted by a more flexible non-rectangular hyperbola, which 
included an additional parameter to describe the degree of 
curvature of the light response (Thornley 1976). The non-
rectangular hyperbolic description of the light response was 
then linked to a mechanistic expression for Rubisco based on 
competitive inhibition between  CO2 and  O2 (Farquhar et al. 
1980a). This formulation is effective at approximating the 
environmental responses of gas-exchange, but incorrectly 
predicts that the activity of the electron transport system 
limits the activity of carbon metabolism under saturating 
light and saturating  CO2. To address this issue, another 
model was developed that links a linear, Blackman-type 
light response to the mechanistic expression for Rubisco 
(Collatz et al. 1991). This framework correctly predicts that 
the activity of carbon metabolism limits the activity of the 
electron transport system under saturating light and satu -
rating  CO2. Since it is effective at describing the states of 
regulation under different environmental conditions, it was 
also extended to simulate chlorophyll fluorescence (van der 
Tol et al. 2014). While this model performs well when it can 
be calibrated directly, it is still empirical and the predictive 
skill degrades outside the calibration domain. To address 
this issue, we have recently developed a new model that 
links a Cyt  b6f-based description of the light response to the 
Rubisco-based description of the  CO2 response (Johnson 
and Berry 2021). By describing the light response mecha-
nistically rather than empirically, the model can be used to 
infer the state of regulation under different light intensities 
and  CO2 levels. This permits more accurate and efficient 
simulation of gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and 
other optical probes of electron transport. It also provides 
a new basis for analyzing how the temperature sensitivities 
of the electron transport system contribute to the overall 
temperature response of photosynthesis. The latter is a key 
priority both for understanding the  C3 pathway itself, and for 
understanding the relative advantages and disadvantages of 
the  C3 relative to the  C4 pathway.
The  C4 photosynthetic pathway
Insights into the differences between  C3 and  C4 photo-
synthesis began to emerge during the 1960s. During this 
period, it was established that the  C3 pathway takes place 
entirely in leaf mesophyll cells, but the  C4 pathway involves 
both the mesophyll and bundle sheath. It was found that 
in  C4 photosynthesis,  CO2 from the mesophyll is initially 
fixed into oxaloacetate by PEP carboxylase (PEPC; EC 
4.1.1.31) and oxaloacetate is converted to malate and/or 
aspartate (Kortschak et al. 1965; Slack and Hatch 1967). 
The organic acids were then found to be shuttled into the 
bundle sheath, where Rubisco is situated (Björkman and 
Gauhl 1969). During the 1970s, it was established that the 
NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME; EC 1.1.1.40), NAD-
malic enzyme (NAD-ME; EC 1.1.1.39), and/or PEP carbox-
ykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.49) decarboxylates the organic 
acids in the bundle sheath, releasing  CO2 in the vicinity of 
Rubisco (Hatch et al. 1975). In combination, these observa-
tions indicated that the primary rate-limiting factor in meso-
phyll carbon metabolism is PEP carboxylase, while that in 
bundle sheath carbon metabolism is Rubisco. During the 
1980s, the relationship between cell type-specific patterns 
of carbon metabolism and electron transport was pursued. It 
was found that the distinct energetic requirements of meso-
phyll and bundle sheath carbon metabolism are supported 
by modifications in linear and cyclic flow within each cell 
type, and that these vary depending on the decarboxylation 
pathway (Chapman et al. 1980; Hatch 1987). This suggested 
that the efficient operation of the  C4 pathway requires cell 
type-specific balancing of the absorption cross-sections of 
PS I and PS II in relation to the primary kinetic bottleneck 
at Cyt  b6f. During the 1990s, there were initial advances in 
understanding the regulatory processes that coordinate flux 
between the limits set by Cyt  b6f, PEPC, and Rubisco. In 
addition to the forms of regulation evident in the  C3 cycle, 
it was established that under limiting light there is down-
regulation of PEPC that is coordinated with that of other 
enzymes in the  C4 cycle (Furbank and Taylor 1995; Chol-
let et al. 1996; Leegood and Walker 1999). This reinforced 
the earlier idea that regulation of rate-limiting steps is the 
general way of maintaining coordination between electron 
transport and carbon metabolism. However, the conceptual 
understanding of how the  C4 photosynthetic pathway oper-
ates as an integrated system in dynamic environments has 
remained relatively less clear and less comprehensive than 
analogous understanding of the  C3 photosynthetic pathway. 
Due to the complexity of the  C4 system, there is a need and 
an opportunity for modeling to contribute here.
The development of quantitative models of  C4 pho-
tosynthesis has been closely linked to the development 
of quantitative models of  C3 photosynthesis. In the late 
1970s, a conceptual model was formulated that represented 
PEPC activity in the mesophyll as the rate-limiting step in 
the initial fixation of  CO2, transport of organic acids and 
decarboxylation in the bundle sheath (Berry and Farquhar 
1978). This model demonstrated that when the  C4-cycle 
pumps  CO2 into the bundle sheath faster than  CO2 leaks out 
of the bundle sheath, the resulting increase in the bundle 
sheath  CO2 relative to  O2 competitively inhibits  O2 fixation, 
allowing Rubisco to operate close to its maximal rate of 
 CO2 fixation. Similar to the  C3 models formulated around 
this time, this formulation is effective at approximating the 
environmental responses of gas-exchange, but incorrectly 
predicts that the activity of the electron transport system 
limits the activity of carbon metabolism under saturating 
light and saturating  CO2. During the 1990s, another model 
844 Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866
1 3
was developed that addressed this issue by linking a linear, 
Blackman-type light response to mechanistic expressions 
for PEPC and Rubisco (Collatz et al. 1992). However, this 
model also intentionally simplified the kinetic descriptions 
of PEPC and Rubisco to facilitate applications to larger-scale 
environmental simulations (Sellers et al. 1996a, b). It was 
later extended to simulate chlorophyll fluorescence (van der 
Tol et al. 2014). In a parallel strand of  C4 model develop-
ment, the earlier non-rectangular hyperbolic expression for 
the light response was brought back in and was again linked 
to the complete kinetic expressions for PEPC and Rubisco 
(von Caemmerer and Furbank 1999; von Caemmerer 2000, 
2021). In both of these strands of  C4 model development, 
the potential linear electron transport of the leaf has been 
modeled as a whole and then partially allocated to the  C3 
and  C4 cycles. This approach was designed to provide a 
simple way to accommodate the variable contributions of 
the different  C4 decarboxylases and 3-phosphoglyceric acid 
export to the energy budget. A number of refinements of the 
stoichiometries associated with these processes have been 
proposed over the years (e.g., Furbank et al. 1990; Yin and 
Struik 2012, 2018, 2021; Bellasio 2017). However, the fun-
damental issue remains that all of these  C4 models are miss-
ing a fully mechanistic description of the light response, and 
this limits their ability to clearly explain the coordination 
between electron transport and carbon metabolism. This is 
a key priority for model development, and one that we will 
tackle here by progressively building up the components 
of the full  C4 pathway from their foundation in the  C3–C4 
intermediate pathways.
The  C3–C4 intermediate photosynthetic pathways
When  C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis was originally 
discovered in the 1970s, it was clear that  C3–C4 intermedi-
ate plants exhibited a sensitivity to  O2 that was intermediate 
between the sensitivities of  C3 and  C4 plants, but it was not 
clear what mechanism(s) were responsible for this (Kennedy 
and Laetsch 1974). Two conceptual models were considered: 
one in which the intermediate sensitivity to  O2 was due to 
low levels of  C4-cycle activity, and one in which it was due 
to refixation of  CO2 released from the photosynthetic carbon 
oxidation cycle (Monson et al. 1984). Before a mechanism 
was identified for the refixation of  CO2 released from the 
photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle, a quantitative model 
of  C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis was developed based 
on the assumption that the physiological characteristics of 
 C3–C4 intermediate plants were generated solely by low 
levels of  C4-cycle activity (i.e., via malate and/or aspartate 
shuttling; Peisker 1984, 1986; Peisker and Bauwe 1984). 
Following the discovery that the P-protein of the glycine 
decarboxylase (GDC; EC 1.4.4.2) complex was localized to 
the bundle sheath in  C3–C4 intermediate plants, it became 
clear that the physiological characteristics of some  C3–C4 
intermediate plants might be generated solely by recycling 
of  CO2 released from the photosynthetic carbon oxidation 
cycle within the bundle sheath (Hylton et al. 1988; i.e., via 
glycine shuttling; Rawsthorne et al. 1988a, b). Based on this 
conceptual model, von Caemmerer (1989, 1992) developed 
a new quantitative model to represent the glycine shuttle. 
Later, von Caemmerer (2000) synthesized the expressions 
developed by Peisker and Bauwe (1984), Peisker (1986), 
von Caemmerer (1989), and von Caemmerer (1992) into 
equations that could represent Type I, Type II, or  C4-like 
 C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis (Table  1). In the equa-
tion set described by von Caemmerer (2000), the basis of 
the glycine shuttle is the localization of some of the Rubisco 
activity and some or all of the GDC activity in the bundle 
sheath rather than in the mesophyll. Under environmental 
conditions that exacerbate Rubisco oxygenase activity in the 
mesophyll, this configuration leads to: (i) net production of 
glycine in the mesophyll; (ii) net diffusion of glycine into the 
bundle sheath; (iii) decarboxylation of that glycine within 
the bundle sheath, (iv) an increase in the bundle sheath  CO2/
O2 ratio, and (v) a corresponding increase in the efficiency of 
 CO2 fixation by the bundle sheath Rubisco. Under environ-
mental conditions that exacerbate Rubisco oxygenase activ-
ity in the bundle sheath, (i)–(v) are reversed. As a result of 
this environmental sensitivity, there is not a fixed energetic 
cost or benefit associated with the glycine shuttle. Instead, 
the glycine shuttle tends to confer a net energetic benefit 
over the  C3 pathway under conditions that promote Rubisco 
oxygenase activity in the mesophyll, and a net energetic cost 
under conditions that suppress such activity.
At present, it is unclear whether this model is correct. 
Forward simulations based on these equations have gener -
ated predictions that Type I  C3–C4 plants should exhibit 
higher rates of net  CO2 assimilation than  C3 plants under 
typical midday conditions (i.e., saturating light, moderate 
leaf temperatures, and modern atmospheric  CO2 and  O2 
levels; von Caemmerer 1989, 2000; Schuster and Monson 
1990; Monson and Rawsthorne 2000; Heckmann et al. 
2013; Mallmann et al. 2014; Way et al. 2014; Bellasio 
and Farquhar 2019). All else being equal, there is a clear 
theoretical basis for expecting that such relative advan-
tages in the net  CO2 assimilation rates should translate 
into corresponding advantages in the photosynthetic 
resource-use efficiencies (Field 1983; Field et al. 1983; 
Field and Mooney 1986; Monson 1989b; Schuster and 
Monson 1990; Monson and Rawsthorne 2000; Christin 
and Osborne 2014; Way et al. 2014; Lundgren 2020; Sun-
dermann et al. 2021). However, Type I  C3–C4 plants have 
not consistently exhibited higher photosynthetic rates, 
light-use efficiencies, water-use efficiencies, or nitrogen-
use efficiencies than  C3 plants when measurements have 
been made under these conditions (Brown and Brown 
845Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866

1975; Brown and Simmons 1979; Bolton and Brown 
1980; Ehleringer and Pearcy 1983; Henning and Brown 
1986; Monson et al. 1986; Fladung and Hesselbach 1989; 
Monson 1989b; Krall et al. 1991; Ku et al. 1991; Mon-
son and Rawsthorne 2000; Huxman and Monson 2003; 
Voznesenskaya et al. 2007; Vogan et al. 2007; Pinto et al. 
2011, 2014; Vogan and Sage 2011, 2012; Khoshravesh 
et al. 2016; Lundgren et al. 2016). From a quantitative 
perspective, there are two explanations for the discrep -
ancy between the observations and predictions: either (i) 
there is a fundamental problem with the structure of the 
model of  C3–C4 photosynthesis, or (ii) the structure of the 
model is correct, but there is a fundamental problem with 
the parameterizations used for the simulations. For exam -
ple, it has been suggested that the strong light depend -
ence of the  CO2 compensation point may indicate that 
 C3–C4 photosynthesis does not work exactly as described 
above (von Caemmerer 2000). The most straightforward 
way to differentiate between this type of structural error 
versus a parameterization error is to fit the  C3–C4 model 
to physiological measurements, objectively evaluate the 
quality of the fit between the model and the measure-
ments, and compare the measurement-derived parameter 
set to the parameter set specified for the simulations. With 
this approach, the quality-of-fit statistics can be used to 
identify problems with model structure (i.e., testing the 
first hypothesis), and the inverse parameter estimates can 
be used to identify problems with model parameterization 
(i.e., testing the second hypothesis). To enable this mode 
of analysis, we will rely on the approach introduced by 
Johnson and Berry (2021) and described below.
A general framework for modeling  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 
photosynthesis
Although inverse fitting has started to become established 
as an approach for interpreting physiological measurements 
of  C3 and  C4 plants, it is still not widely used and has not yet 
been applied to  C3–C4 plants (e.g., Yin et al. 2009 , 2011; 
Bellasio et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2019). The main reason for 
this is that none of the current  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 models are 
formulated in a way that is ideal for fitting to experimental 
data. On the one hand, in the type of models that are simple 
enough to be fit directly to data and that we have discussed 
here, a large fraction of the key parameters are empirical 
(e.g., the θ and Jmax parameters describing the curvature and 
asymptote of the light response, respectively). Since there 
is no way to independently evaluate the fitted values of the 
empirical parameters in these frameworks, it is difficult to 
differentiate between problems with model structure versus 
model parameterization. On the other hand, in more com-
plex models where a larger fraction of the parameters are 
mechanistic, there are simply too many free variables to con-
strain with typical experimental observations (e.g., Laisk 
and Edwards 2000; Laisk et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2013; Wang 
et al. 2014, 2017, 2021; Morales et al. 2018). Since there is 
no way to rigorously confront the hypotheses in these frame-
works with data, it is also difficult to differentiate between 
problems with model structure versus model parameteriza-
tion. To address these challenges and opportunities, we have 
developed a general model of  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 photosyn-
thesis that is designed to facilitate inverse analysis of physi-
ological measurements (Fig. 1).
Table 1  Functional distinctions between  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 photosynthesis
Traditionally, the categorization of  C3–C4 and  C4 plants into discrete ‘types’ has been used to emphasize general patterns of functional similari-
ties and differences. However, it is important to recognize that many biochemical and anatomical attributes of these plants exhibit continuous

The new model is organized around three design criteria. 
First, this framework is designed to describe the overall pho-
tosynthetic process at the leaf-level when it has achieved a 
fully reversible steady-state with the measuring environment. 
At this spatial and temporal scale, the dynamics of photo-
synthesis are much simpler than they are within particular 
sub-systems and/or during transient adjustments because 
they become keyed to the boundary conditions imposed by 
energy, mass, and charge balance. This makes this scale a 
tractable starting point for mathematical analysis. Second,  
this framework is designed to link the photosynthetic process 
to the full suite of observable quantities that can be evalu-
ated via leaf-level measurements. Most current frameworks 
for modeling leaf-level photosynthesis are organized around 
trace gas concentration and/or isotope ratio measurements. 
Here, we have formulated a model that can also communi-
cate with a diverse array of fluorescence- and absorbance-
based measurements. Third, this framework is designed to 
explain the environmental, biochemical, and anatomical  
factors that control the patterns of photosynthetic perfor-
mance. In formulating this model, we have avoided empiri-
cal descriptions that rely on statistical coefficients without 
precise physical meaning, as well as putatively mechanistic 
descriptions that are untestable. Instead, we have articulated 
hypotheses about the specific mechanisms that give rise to 
the observed patterns, and we have done so in a way that 
permits these hypotheses to be evaluated with independent 
measurements.
The new model brings together the description of  C3 
electron transport from Johnson and Berry (2021) with 
the descriptions of  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 carbon metabolism 
from Berry and Farquhar (1978), Farquhar et al. (1980a), 
Farquhar and von Caemmerer (1981), von Caemmerer 
and Farquhar (1981), Peisker and Bauwe (1984), Peisker 
(1986), von Caemmerer (1989), Collatz et al. (1991), Col-
latz et al. (1992), von Caemmerer and Furbank (1999), 
von Caemmerer ( 2000 ), von Caemmerer et al. ( 2009 ), 
von Caemmerer (2013), van der Tol et al. (2014), von 
Caemmerer (2020, 2021). The resulting framework 
describes the steady-state responses of  C3,  C3–C4, and 
 C4 photosynthesis to variation in light, carbon dioxide, 
and temperature. While the model can generate simula-
tions over arbitrarily wide ranges of measurement light 
intensities, carbon dioxide levels, and leaf temperatures, 
it does not represent stress responses. As a result, the 
descriptions of regulatory interactions are only accurate 
within the ranges of conditions that leaves have accli -
mated to during growth. The equations that correspond to 
the schematic in Fig.  1 are presented in Appendices I-V in 
the Electronic Supplementary Material. To draw atten-
tion to the core aspects of model structure, we focus on 
the  C3, Type I  C3–C4, and NADP-ME  C4 cases (Table  1), 
and we illustrate these cases using a simplified model 
parameterization (Table  2). In the next section (Model 
Development), we discuss the series of three steps in 
model development, emphasizing the rationale for and 
theory underlying each step. In the subsequent section 
(Model Application), we then demonstrate how these 
developments come together in a way that enables the 
model to be applied for the quantitative interpretation of 
physiological measurements.
Model development
In this model, we use the mechanistic description of elec -
tron transport from Johnson and Berry (2021) to represent 
the potential electron transport capacities of the mesophyll 
chloroplasts and bundle sheath chloroplasts separately. This 
creates a foundation for analyzing the mechanisms of energy 
sharing between the mesophyll and bundle sheath. We begin 
by introducing the Cyt  b6f-based expression for electron 
transport and replicating it for the mesophyll and bundle 
sheath. Next, we discuss a hierarchical solution to the model 
that permits the mesophyll and bundle sheath to transition 
independently between limitation by electron transport and 
carbon metabolism. Finally, we turn to the formulation of 
the temperature response functions for electron transport and 
carbon metabolism.
Limits and regulation of electron transport
What controls the light response of steady-state photosyn-
thesis? To answer this question in a general way, we have 
extended a mechanistic framework for modeling steady-
state electron transport in the  C3 case (Fig. 1a) to the  C3–C4 
and  C4 cases (Figs. 1b and c). This framework is organized 
around linear electron flow (LEF). In this process, light that 
is absorbed by PS II and PS I is used to split  H2O and drive 
electrons through the intersystem chain to form reductant 
(Fd and NADPH). Within the intersystem chain, the light-
driven electron flow is coupled to proton pumping at Cyt  b6f, 
and the resulting proton motive force is used to drive ATP 
production at the ATP synthase. The Fd, NADPH, and ATP 
are then consumed by  C3 and/or  C4 carbon metabolism (i.e., 
Eqs. 1–10). Our approach to modeling LEF is based on the 
observation that Cyt  b6f is the primary kinetic bottleneck in 
the electron transport system and is the target of a hierarchy 
of regulatory feedbacks stemming from carbon metabolism 
(e.g., see reviews by Kallas 2012; Schöttler and Tóth 2014; 
Finazzi et al. 2016; Tikhonov 2018; Simkin et al. 2019; 
Malone et al. 2021; Sarewicz et al. 2021). We developed 
experimental methods to estimate the in vivo maximum 
activity of Cyt  b6f and identify the conditions under which 
feedback control of Cyt  b6f is active or relaxed, and then 
used these approaches to relate the biochemical properties 
848 Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866
1 3
of Cyt  b6f to the steady-state dynamics of photosynthesis in 
intact  C3 leaves (Johnson and Berry 2021).
Mathematically, this framework describes the potential 
rate of electron transport through Cyt  b6f with a concise 
analytic expression that is a rectangular hyperbolic function 
of incident light intensity (i.e., Eqs. 11a, b), and a linear 
function of the redox state of plastoquinone (Fig.  2). This 
form of the electron transport response to light emerges 
Table 2  Input parameters for  C3, Type I  C3–C4, and  C4 simulations
We have used an intentionally simplified parameterization to facilitate interpretation of the simulations. For most parameters, only a single value 
is given and this is applied to all three pathways. For the pathway-specific parameterizations, values are given for  C3, Type I  C3–C4, and  C4 
cases, respectively. The parameterization of constants related to carbon metabolism follows von Caemmerer (2000), and the parameterization of 
constants related to electron transport follows Johnson and Berry (2021). The values given for the physiological variables and all of the constants 
correspond to a reference temperature of 25 °C. The scaling of temperature-sensitive parameters follows the approach described in the Model 
Development section, where the activation term from Jmax is assigned to Vmax of Cyt  b6f and the deactivation term from Jmax is assigned to the nL 
and nC parameters that describe the efficiency of coupling between NADPH, Fd, and ATP production

from two regulated properties: (i) at the limit where light 
approaches zero, the initial slope is determined by the 
absorption cross-sections and maximum photochemical 
yields of PS I and PS II (Fig.  2a; dark-acclimated state); 
whereas (ii) at the limit where light goes to infinity, the 
asymptote is determined by the maximum activity of Cyt 
 b6f (Fig. 2a; Vmax of Cyt  b6f in mesophyll). In between these 
limits, the sensitivity of electron transport to light declines 
progressively because the light-independent kinetic bottle -
neck at Cyt  b6f causes an increasing fraction of the PS I and 
PS II reaction centers to accumulate in the closed state as 
the light-dependent excitation pressure on PS I and PS II 
increases. Due to the kinetic restriction at Cyt  b6f, the closed 
state is reduced at PS II and oxidized at PS I, but in both 
cases represents a state where photochemistry cannot occur. 
This creates a fundamental trade-off between the rate and the 
efficiency of potential electron transport through Cyt  b6f, and 
this trade-off structures the responses of photosynthesis to 
 CO2,  O2, and temperature.
As environmental conditions vary, regulatory interactions 
that center on Cyt  b6f maintain coordination between elec-
tron transport and carbon metabolism (e.g., see reviews by 
Woodrow and Berry 1988; Foyer et al. 1990, 2012; Genty 
and Harbinson 1996; Baker et al. 2007; Cornic and Baker 
2012; Tikkanen et al. 2012; Malone et al. 2021). For our 
purposes, it is sufficient to differentiate between two limiting 
states. We use ‘light-limited’ to refer to the metabolic state 
where electron transport is limiting carbon metabolism (i.e., 
Eqs. 11–16), and ‘light-saturated’ to refer to the metabolic 
state where carbon metabolism is limiting electron transport 
(i.e., Eqs. 17–20). Under any specific environmental condi-
tion, the actual state corresponds to the most limiting of 
the potential states (Fig.  2; upper bounds of green shaded 
regions). In the light-limited state, electron transport activ -
ity depends on the supply of substrate (reduced plastoqui-
none) and the V max of the rate-limiting enzyme (Cyt  b6f) 
(Fig. 2a–c; actual light-limited rate). Since the total light-
driven electron flow is insufficient to satisfy the potential 
demand of the sinks for NADPH, Fd, and ATP, the activity 
of Rubisco and/or PEPC is downregulated to an extent that is 
determined by the availability of electron donors (Fig. 2a–c; 
blue and red shaded regions). In the light-saturated state, 
these patterns are reversed (Fig. 2a–c; actual light-saturated 
rate). Here, the activity of the sinks depends on the supply 
Fig. 2  The maximum activity of Cyt  b6f limits electron transport in 
the mesophyll and bundle sheath. For the a  C3, b Type I  C3–C4, and c 
 C4 cases, the light-limited rates are defined by the sloping lines from 
the dark-acclimated state (i.e., point 1) to the V max of Cyt  b6f (i.e., 
point 3 in mesophyll and point 5 in bundle sheath), and the light-sat-
urated rates are defined by the horizontal lines through the light-satu-
ration points (i.e., point 2 in mesophyll and point 4 in bundle sheath).

of substrate  (CO2 and  O2) and the Vmax of the rate-limiting 
enzymes (Rubisco and/or PEPC). Since the total potential 
light-driven electron flow would exceed the capacity of the 
sinks, the activity of Cyt  b6f is downregulated to an extent 
that is determined by the availability of electron acceptors 
(Fig. 2a–c; yellow shaded regions).
The definition of the light-limited and light-saturated 
states permits quantification of three forms of regulation: 
cyclic electron flow around PS I (CEF1), non-photochemical 
quenching of PS II (NPQ), and photosynthetic control of 
Cyt  b6f (PC). In CEF1, light that is absorbed by PS I is 
used to drive electrons from the Fd and/or NADPH pools 
back into the intersystem chain and through Cyt  b6f. Since 
the associated proton pumping can drive ATP formation, 
this pathway can be engaged to balance the energy supply 
from electron transport with the energy demand of carbon 
metabolism. In the steady-state, the partitioning between 
LEF and CEF1 is controlled by the excitation of the PS II 
versus PS I antennae. As sink demands for Fd, NADPH, 
and ATP vary, NPQ can be engaged to adjust the excitation 
distribution between PS II and PS I. Different forms of NPQ 
can be engaged under different conditions (e.g., state transi-
tions (qT), chloroplast movements (qM), psbS-dependent 
(qE) and zeaxanthin-dependent (qZ) quenching). However, 
the family of NPQ processes does not dissipate all of the 
excess excitation from the antennae system under saturating 
light. To protect the system from photodamage, PC can be 
engaged. Photosynthetic control restricts linear electron flow 
through Cyt  b6f to a rate that is balanced with the capacity 
of carbon metabolism to provide electron acceptors. Since 
all three of these regulatory interactions coordinate electron 
transport with carbon metabolism between the lumen and 
stroma of individual chloroplasts, they provide a founda -
tion for analyzing how photosynthesis works when there is 
specialization of electron transport and carbon metabolism 
between populations of chloroplasts in the mesophyll and 
bundle sheath.
Interactions between mesophyll and bundle sheath
While chloroplasts that are experiencing similar environ-
mental conditions and have similar photosynthetic capaci-
ties are expected to transition synchronously between 
light-limited and light-saturated states, chloroplasts that 
are experiencing dissimilar environmental conditions and/
or have different photosynthetic capacities are expected to 
transition asynchronously between light limitation and light 
saturation. To model photosynthesis in a way that captures 
these dynamics, the equation set needs to be solved differ -
ently than has typically been done to date. The  C3–C4 model 
described by von Caemmerer (2000) and the  C4 model 
described by von Caemmerer (2021) are based on expres-
sions for pure states, i.e., conditions where the mesophyll 
and bundle sheath are both light-limited or both light-satu-
rated. However, since the mesophyll and bundle sheath chlo-
roplasts are segregated in distinct environments and since 
each population has distinct capacities for electron trans-
port and for carbon metabolism, the mesophyll and bundle 
sheath have the potential to transition independently between 
light-limitation and light-saturation, creating mixed states 
(i.e., Eqs. 21–22). The possibility of mixed states occur -
ring within the  C4 pathway was originally hypothesized by 
Peisker and Henderson (1992), and it applies equally to the 
 C3–C4 pathway. To simulate mixed states in a realistic way, 
the equation set needs to be solved in a way that respects two 
logical constraints: (i) the limiting state of the mesophyll 
controls the rate of glycine shuttling and malate shuttling 
to the bundle sheath, and therefore influences the bundle 
sheath environment, but (ii) the bundle sheath may or may 
not operate under the same limiting state as the mesophyll. 
To achieve this, we have developed a hierarchical approach 
to solving the equation set (i.e., Eqs. 23–25).
To evaluate the hierarchical solution, we tested the skill 
of the full model in simulating the light response of the 
 CO2 compensation point ( Γ ). The  CO2 compensation point 
is defined as the  CO2 concentration at which there is no 
net  CO2 assimilation. The Γ values of  C3 and  C4 plants are 
nearly insensitive to light intensity, with the exception being 
at very low light intensities where there is a respiratory effect 
(Laing et al. 1974; Čatský and Tichá 1979; Peisker 1979; 
Farquhar et al. 1980a; Brooks and Farquhar 1985). In the  C3 
case, Γ corresponds to a state where the  CO2 uptake driven 
by Rubisco carboxylase activity is balanced by the  CO2 
loss driven by Rubisco oxygenase activity and mitochon-
drial (dark) respiration (i.e., from Eq. 5, Vcm = Vgm + Rm). In 
the  C4 case, Γ corresponds to a state where the  CO2 uptake 
driven by PEPC in the mesophyll is balanced by the  CO2 
loss driven by the diffusive leak out of the bundle sheath 
(i.e., from Eq. 5, Vpm = L + Rm). In these cases, the activities 
of Rubisco and PEPC are kinetically limited by the  CO2 sup-
ply rather than energetically limited by electron transport, 
such that Γ is insensitive to light intensity. In contrast, the 
Γ values of  C3–C4 plants decrease curvilinearly in response 
to increasing light intensities (Brown and Morgan 1980; 
Holaday et al. 1982; Hattersley et al. 1986; Rajendrudu et al. 
1986; Cheng et al. 1989; Ku et al. 1991; Dai et al. 1996). 
The oxygen and temperature responses of the Γ values of 
 C3–C4 plants also appear to be sensitive to light intensity, 
with higher light intensities associated with higher break-
points in each response (Keck and Ogren 1976; Quebedeaux 
and Chollet 1977; Apel 1980; Morgan and Brown 1980; 
Brown and Morgan 1980; Holaday et al. 1982, 1984; Hunt 
et al. 1987; Moore et al. 1987a; Ku et al. 1991; Dai et al. 
1996; Vogan et al. 2007). To date, it has not been clear what 
mechanisms are responsible for the environmental responses 
of Γ in  C3–C4 plants, but mixed states seem likely to be 
851Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866 
1 3
involved (Edwards and Ku 1987; Rawsthorne et al. 1992; 
Rawsthorne 1992; Leegood and von Caemmerer 1994; von 
Caemmerer 2000).
The model predicts that a pure state is responsible for the 
light-insensitive values of Γ in the  C3 and  C4 cases (i.e., 47 
and 0.5 /u1D707bar  CO2 at 25 °C, respectively), and that a mixed 
state is responsible for the light-sensitivity of Γ in the Type 
I  C3–C4 case (Fig. 3a). Here, Γ corresponds to a state where 
the  CO2 uptake driven by Rubisco carboxylase activity in 
the mesophyll is equivalent to the  CO2 loss driven by the 
diffusive leak out of the bundle sheath (i.e., from Eq. 5, 
Vcm = L + Rm). At this point, the mesophyll is a net  CO2 
source and the bundle sheath is a net  CO2 sink (Fig. 3b). The 
mesophyll is a net  CO2 source because the glycine shuttle is 
mobilizing fixed carbon from the mesophyll and delivering 
the derived  CO2 to the bundle sheath. The bundle sheath 
is a net  CO2 sink because the bundle sheath  CO2 is raised 
to a level that permits net export of reduced carbon from 
the bundle sheath Rubisco population. When the mesophyll 
and bundle sheath are both light-limited, increasing light 
stimulates  CO2 delivery to and uptake within the bundle 
sheath. However, the  CO2 delivery to the bundle sheath 
increases faster than the  CO2 uptake within the bundle 
sheath, such that the  CO2:O2 ratio rises (Fig. 3c). Since this 
also increases the rate at which  CO2 leaks out of the bundle 
sheath, Γ would stabilize if the mesophyll and bundle sheath 
were both to remain light-limited. Instead, the  CO2 supply 
to the bundle sheath stabilizes when the mesophyll becomes 
light-saturated (Fig.  3d). While the bundle sheath remains 
light-limited, the activity of Rubisco continues to be stimu-
lated by light, drawing down the  CO2:O2 ratio in the bundle 
sheath and slowing the rate at which  CO2 leaks out of the 
bundle sheath (Fig. 3e). The net effect of these interactions 
is that a larger fraction of the  CO2 delivered to the bundle 
sheath is assimilated, such that Γ continues to decrease with 
light (Fig. 3f). Based on this analysis, we conclude that the 
light-sensitivity of Γ is most likely an indicator of a mixed 
state. Mixed states are likely to be a key component of  C3–C4 
photosynthesis as well as  C4 photosynthesis. They may be 
encountered either when leaves are exposed to environmen-
tal conditions that are outside those they have acclimated 
Fig. 3  Photosynthetic control of Cyt  b6f occurs independently in the 
mesophyll and bundle sheath. To simulate the light dependence of 
the  CO2 compensation point ( Γ) in the Type I  C3–C4 intermediate 
pathway, the model must be solved in a way that permits each cell 
type to transition independently between the limiting states. See text 
for details of each panel. N.B., x-axes are the same for all panels. A m

to during growth (e.g., such as Γ ), or under normal growth 
conditions (e.g., during parts of the diel cycle).
Basis of temperature sensitivities
While the Cyt  b6f-based description of electron transport 
and the mixed state solution permit the model to simulate 
the response of photosynthesis to variation in light,  CO2, and 
 O2 under constant temperature, additional expressions are 
required to explain the temperature-dependence of photosyn-
thesis. At present, several different functions are in use and 
many species-specific parameter sets have been derived for 
each of them (e.g., see Berry and Raison 1981; Sellers et al. 
1996b; von Caemmerer 2000; von Caemmerer et al. 2009; 
Bernacchi et al. 2013 ). In principle, any of these expres -
sions can be applied to this model. However, the fundamen-
tal challenge in choosing among these functions is neither 
the appropriate functional form nor the correct parameter 
values, but the assignment of scaling factors to the correct 
underlying mechanisms. In particular, it is not yet clear how 
the intrinsic temperature sensitivities of the electron trans-
port system interact with the intrinsic temperature sensitivi-
ties of carbon metabolism. The primary observations that 
are relevant to this question are: (i) LEF usually exhibits a 
thermal optimum and declines at high temperatures (e.g., 
Yamori et al. 2014); (ii) CEF1 is usually stimulated rela-
tive to linear electron transport at high temperatures (e.g., 
Ivanov et al. 2017); (iii) NPQ tends to be stimulated at high 
temperatures (e.g., Demmig-Adams et al. 2014); (iv) the 
plastoquinone pool tends to become more oxidized at high 
temperatures (e.g., Sharkey and Zhang 2010); and (v) the 
turnover constant of Cyt  b6f tends to increase with tempera-
ture (e.g., Tikhonov 2018). However, it has been difficult to 
understand the basis of these effects due to the close coordi-
nation between the activity of the electron transport system 
and of carbon metabolism. It has been proposed both that the 
activity of Rubisco is downregulated at high temperatures 
due to a limitation on the activity of the electron transport 
system, and that the activity of the electron transport system 
is downregulated at high temperatures due to a limitation on 
the activity of Rubisco.
To compare the various alternatives quantitatively, we 
have parameterized the new model with different combi-
nations of the temperature sensitivities that Farquhar et al. 
(1980a) originally assigned to electron transport through the 
empirical parameter Jmax (Fig. 4). For all of the simulations, 
we have maintained a fixed set of temperature responses 
for carbon metabolism (i.e., following Farquhar et al. 1980a 
as reviewed by von Caemmerer et al. 2009). Within this 
background, we have selectively varied the localization 
of the activation and deactivation terms from J max (Ea of 
37 kJ  mol−1, Hd 220 kJ  mol−1, ΔS 0.710 kJ  mol−1  K−1). The 
alternative localizations are: (1) no assignment of the J max 
coefficients; (2) Jmax activation term on Vmax of Cyt  b6f; (3) 
Jmax activation and deactivation terms on V max of Cyt  b6f; 
(4) Jmax activation term on Vmax of Cyt  b6f and deactivation 
terms on Vmax of Rubisco; (5) Jmax activation term on Vmax of 
Cyt  b6f and deactivation terms on the efficiency of coupling 
between electron transport and ATP production. While all 
five parameterizations predict a thermal optimum in net  CO2 
assimilation (Fig.  4a), each predicts a distinct combination 
of temperature responses in the rate of LEF (Fig.  4b), the 
rate of CEF1 (Fig. 4c), the level of NPQ of PS II (Fig.  4d), 
the redox poise of the plastoquinone pool (Fig. 4e), and the 
turnover constant of Cyt  b6f (Fig. 4f). The predictions only 
capture all of the primary features of the observations when 
the activation term from J max is assigned to Vmax of Cyt  b6f 
and the deactivation term from J max is assigned to the n L 
and nC parameters that describe the efficiency of coupling 
between NADPH, Fd, and ATP production (Fig.  4b–f; red 
lines). This suggests that increasing temperatures may have 
two general effects on the electron transport system: first, 
increasing the V max of Cyt  b6f; and second, decreasing 
the efficiency of coupling between NADPH, Fd, and ATP 
production.
These results have three main implications. First, this 
modeling framework provides a new foundation for under -
standing and predicting the temperature responses of pho-
tosynthesis. In this analysis, we have leveraged existing 
temperature response functions to illustrate the model’s 
ability to simulate multiple observable quantities derived 
from gas-exchange, fluorescence, and absorbance measure-
ments. However, this application should not be interpreted 
as an endorsement either of this specific functional form or 
this specific parameterization. Further research is needed 
to evaluate the most appropriate functional form and 
parameterization of the temperature responses. Second, it 
is likely that increasing temperature stimulates the maxi-
mum activity of Cyt  b6f, but the magnitude of this effect is 
in need of improved quantification. Although assigning the 
activation term from Jmax to Vmax of Cyt  b6f permits a qual-
itatively realistic simulation of the temperature response, 
this is not expected to be quantitatively realistic because 
the Vmax of Cyt  b6f is not equivalent to the J max parameter 
of Farquhar et al. (1980a). The J max parameter represents 
the rate of electron transport that occurs under saturating 
light and saturating  CO2, and in  C3 leaves at 25 °C this 
is around one-half of the true maximum potential rate of 
electron transport that is defined by the substrate-saturated 
rate of electron flow through Cyt  b6f (Johnson and Berry 
2021). In vivo and in vitro evaluations of the temperature 
sensitivity of the V max of Cyt  b6f are needed. Third, the 
reversible decline in photosynthesis at high temperatures 
may be caused by a decline in the efficiency of coupling 
between NADPH, Fd, and ATP production. In principle, 
such a decline in coupling efficiency might be driven by 
853Oecologia (2021) 197:841–866

a temperature effect on: (i) the coupling between electron 
flow and proton translocation at Cyt  b6f; (ii) the proton 
“leakiness” of the thylakoid membrane; (iii) the coupling 
between proton translation and ATP formation at ATP syn-
thase; and/or (iv) other related mechanisms. This possibil-
ity is distinct from the alternative hypotheses that are cur -
rently dominant, and the full range of hypotheses deserve 
careful experimental evaluation. In the next section, we 
will illustrate how the model can be used as a tool to aid 
in this type of quantitative interpretation of physiological 
measurements.
Model applications
This model can be used for forward simulations and for 
inverse fitting. In this section, we provide examples of both 
types of applications. We first present forward simulations 
that illustrate the responses of  C3, Type I  C3–C4, and  C4 
photosynthesis to light, carbon dioxide, and tempera-
ture. The simulations demonstrate how the Cyt  b6f-based 
expressions for electron transport, the hierarchical solution 
for mixed states, and the temperature dependencies come 
together in the overall performance of the model. We then

present inverse analyses that illustrate how the model can 
be used to interpret gas-exchange measurements of a Type 
I  C3–C4 plant, Flaveria chloraefolia. The inverse analy -
ses demonstrate that population-level variation in the  CO2 
compensation point in this species can be explained by 
variable allocation of photosynthetic capacity to the bun-
dle sheath. We conclude by discussing key questions that 
are raised by this framework and posing a novel hypothesis 
about the origins of  C4 photosynthesis.
Forward simulations
The responses of photosynthesis to light, carbon dioxide, 
and temperature vary substantially between the  C3, Type I 
 C3–C4, and  C4 pathways (Fig. 5a–c). Part of the variation is 
controlled by pathway- and cell-type-specific differences in 
photosynthetic capacity which control the absolute amounts 
of Fd, NADPH, and ATP produced and consumed (Table 2). 
The remainder of the variation is controlled by pathway- and 
cell-type-specific differences in photosynthetic metabolism 
which control the relative amounts of Fd, NADPH, and ATP 
that are produced and consumed (Appendix I: Electronic 
Supplementary Material). In this model, three forms of regu-
lation coordinate the energy supply from electron transport 
with the energy demand from carbon metabolism. In any 
given pathway and cell type, the flux through LEF versus 
CEF1 is dynamically modulated to establish a sink-appropri-
ate balance between the supply of ATP and the supply of Fd 
and NADPH (Fig. 5d–f). The partitioning between LEF and 
CEF1 is controlled by the distribution of excitation between 
PS I and PS II. This depends on the relative absorption 
cross-section of each population of photosynthetic units and 
the level of connectivity between photosynthetic units, and is 
dynamically modulated through NPQ (Fig. 5g–i). Once the 
energy supply and demand are balanced in relative terms, 
the final requirement is ensuring that they are also balanced 
in absolute terms. This is achieved via PC of Cyt  b6f, which 
restricts the rate of electron flow to the capacity of carbon 
metabolism to provide acceptors (Fig. 5j–l). Across the three 
pathways, PC tends to be relaxed at low light and to become 
engaged as the light intensity is increased (Fig.  5j), to be 
engaged at low  CO2 and to relax as the  CO2 concentration 
is increased (Fig. 5k), and to be engaged at low temperature 
and to relax as the temperature is increased (Fig.  5l). How-
ever, the Type I  C3–C4 bundle sheath remains light-limited 
under all of these conditions, and the  C4 mesophyll remains 
light-limited under most conditions except the lowest  CO2 
concentrations and lowest temperatures. As a result, mixed 
states are common in both the Type I  C3–C4 and  C4 pathways 
along all three environmental axes.
These simulations demonstrate that this framework both 
reproduces the core dynamics of earlier photosynthesis 
models and introduces new capabilities with respect to 
the interactions between the light,  CO2, and temperature 
responses. To date, the expressions for light-saturated pho-
tosynthesis that were summarized by von Caemmerer (2000) 
have been successful at reproducing: (i) a  CO2 compensa-
tion point for  C3–C4 plants that is intermediate to those of 
 C3 and  C4 plants at atmospheric  O2 levels; (ii) a non-linear 
response of the  CO2 compensation point to variation in  O2 
in  C3–C4 plants; and (iii) a curvilinear response of net  CO2 
assimilation to variation in  CO2 in  C3 and  C3–C4 plants, as 
well as a biphasic response in  C4 plants. The framework 
we have described here builds on this foundation by intro-
ducing expressions for light-limited photosynthesis that are 
successful at reproducing: (iv) a curvilinear response of net 
 CO2 assimilation to variation in light in  C3,  C3–C4, and  C4 
plants; (v) a  CO2 compensation point that is light-dependent 
in  C3–C4 plants; and (vi) a light-dependent decline in net 
 CO2 assimilation at high temperatures in  C3,  C3–C4, and 
 C4 plants. Compared to the empirical expressions that are 
currently used to describe the light response, this more 
mechanistic approach has two main advantages: it provides 
a clearer interpretation of how photosynthesis works as 
an interactive system, and it provides a stronger connec-
tion to quantities that are directly observable. For example, 
the model enables analysis of the flux of light available 
to the mesophyll vs. bundle sheath (i.e., a function of the 
absorptance of each chloroplast population), and the light 
saturation point of the mesophyll vs. bundle sheath (i.e., a 
function of the balance between the Cyt  b6f and Rubisco in 
each chloroplast population). These limits are quite impor -
tant because they structure the suite of regulatory interac-
tions that coordinate electron transport with carbon metabo-
lism (e.g., Fig.  5). However, at present there is relatively 
little quantitative understanding of how pigment and protein 
distributions vary within and between  C3, Type I  C3–C4, 
and  C4 plants. In the next section, we turn to inverse fitting 
to explore pigment and protein distributions and their func-
tional consequences.
Inverse fitting
By fitting the model to observations within an inversion 
framework, the total amounts of pigment and protein as 
well as the relative allocation of pigment and protein to the 
bundle sheath can be inferred rather than prescribed. As an 
example of this approach, we have applied the model to the 
interpretation of the photosynthetic performance of Flaveria 
chloraefolia (Asteraceae). F. chloraefolia is a Type I  C3–C4 
species that has been grown and studied under controlled 
conditions for decades (e.g., Powell 1978; Holaday et al.

Lyu et al. 2021). However, there are very few studies of this 
species under field conditions (e.g., Van Auken et al. 2007; 
Peralta-Garcı́a et al. 2016; Ochoterena et al. 2020; Peralta-
García et al. 2020; Pisanty et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Sánchez 
et al. 2020). We compared the photosynthetic performance 
of a greenhouse-grown research population at the Carnegie 
Institution in Stanford, CA to that of naturally-occurring 
populations at the Blue Hole Ciénega in Guadalupe County, 
NM (34° 56ʹ 8ʺ N, 104° 40ʹ 30ʺ W), and the Diamond Y 
Spring Preserve in Pecos County, TX (31° 0ʹ  36ʺ N, 102° 
55ʹ 5ʺ W). Measurements of the  CO2 response of mature 
leaves were made on the research population in CA dur -
ing the mid-winter, and on the wild populations in NM and 
TX during the mid-summer. At each site, measurements 
were made for n  = 7–15 individual leaves. For each leaf, 
a LI-6400XT (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) system was used to 
vary  CO2 from 0 to 1000 /u1D707bar, at 210 mbar  O2, with a light 
intensity of 1500 /u1D707mol PPFD  m−2  s−1 and leaf temperatures 
ranging between 28 and 33 °C.
To interpret the basis of the measured responses, we fit 
each individual  CO2 response curve to the model using an 
optimization framework (Fig.  6). Tests with synthetic data 
that mimicked the real sampling design and error charac-
teristics demonstrated that the fitting procedure could be 
expected to retrieve up to four free parameters to within ± 1% 
of their true values. The four free variables we selected for 
fitting were: (i) mesophyll conductance to  CO2, (ii) V max 
of Cyt  b6f, (iii) V max of Rubisco, and (iv) the fraction of 
the total absorptance, Vmax of Cyt  b6f and Vmax of Rubisco 
in the bundle sheath. In the measurements, there was leaf-
to-leaf variation in three aspects of the  CO2 response: (i) 
the sensitivity of net  CO2 assimilation to  CO2 at high inter-
cellular  CO2; (ii) the sensitivity of net  CO2 assimilation to 
 CO2 at low intercellular  CO2; and (iii) the  CO2 compen-
sation point (Fig.  6a; points). The largest differences were 
between the greenhouse-grown research population in CA 
and the two wild populations in NM and TX. Compared

to the greenhouse-grown/laboratory-measured population, 
the naturally-occurring/field-measured populations tended 
to exhibit higher sensitivities of net  CO2 assimilation to 
 CO2 across the entire sampled range as well as lower  CO2 
compensation points. The model was able to fit these pat-
terns by varying the mesophyll conductance to  CO2, the total 
amounts of Cyt  b6f and Rubisco, and the fractional allo -
cations of the total absorptance, V max of Cyt  b6f and V max 
of Rubisco to the bundle sheath (Fig.  6a; lines and shaded 
confidence intervals). The fits did not exhibit any systematic 
biases and had relatively little noise (Fig. 6b). Within each of 
the three populations, there was some leaf-to-leaf variation 
in mesophyll conductance to  CO2, Vmax of Cyt  b6f, and Vmax 
of Rubisco (Table 3). However, the parameter that exhibited 
the largest systematic variation between the three popula-
tions was the bundle sheath fraction of absorptance, Cyt 
 b6f, and Rubisco (i.e., with a range from 7 to 17%; Fig.  6c; 
Table 3).
These results have three notable features. First, the qual-
ity-of-fit statistics indicate that the model structure is formu-
lated in a way that captures the major features of the meas-
urements. This is significant because it suggests that model 
parameterization, rather than model structure, could be the 
primary factor contributing to the long-standing discrepancy 
between the predicted versus observed performance of Type 
I  C3–C4 plants (i.e., why they have not exhibited higher rates 
of net  CO2 assimilation than  C3 plants under saturating light, 
moderate leaf temperatures, and modern atmospheric  CO2 
and  O2 levels; as discussed in the Introduction). Specifi-
cally, in previous applications of the modeling framework 
described by von Caemmerer (2000), the parameterizations 
of  C3 and Type I  C3–C4 simulations have assumed equiva-
lent photosynthetic capacities. This may be unrealistic, and 
leads to the second point: the ranges of variation in the 
estimated values of mesophyll conductance to  CO2, Vmax 
of Cyt  b6f, and Vmax of Rubisco are limited. The restricted 
ranges could reflect underlying anatomical constraints 
which facilitate the operation of the glycine shuttle, such as 
contact between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. This is 
significant because it indicates that realizing the biochemical 
advantages of the glycine shuttle may entail an anatomi-
cal trade-off, and such a trade-off could help to reconcile 
observations of Type I  C3–C4 physiology with current under-
standing of the glycine shuttle. For example, if  C3–C4 plants 
are restricted to a limited range of specific leaf areas, this 
could limit the range of  Vmax values of Cyt  b6f and Rubisco 
below that of  C3 plants and help to explain lower area-based 
measurements of the rate of net  CO2 assimilation. Third, the 
bundle sheath fraction of absorptance, Cyt  b6f, and Rubisco 
not only varies significantly between populations, but also 
is consistently higher in the wild populations in NM and 
TX than in the greenhouse-grown population in CA. This 
indicates that the allocation of photosynthetic capacity to 
the bundle sheath is flexible, and suggests that  C3–C4 inter-
mediate plants optimize pigment and protein distributions 
to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of glycine 
shuttling in different environments. In combination, these 
findings demonstrate the potential of the inversion-based 
approach to the interpretation of physiological measure-
ments. Developing this approach further requires revisiting 
the quantitative definition of the energetics of glycine shut-
tling. This is the topic we turn to in the final section.
Key questions
The structure of the Type I  C3–C4 model we have imple-
mented here is a quantitative expression of a conceptual 
model in which the confinement of glycine decarboxylation 
to the bundle sheath has only one functional consequence: 
under conditions that promote oxygen fixation by mesophyll 
Rubisco, glycine is transported into the bundle sheath and 
the  CO2 released from bundle sheath GDC activity builds 
up, increasing the bundle sheath  CO2/O2 ratio and increasing 
the efficiency of  CO2 fixation by the bundle sheath Rubisco. 
Several independent lines of evidence support the infer -
ence that confinement of GDC activity to the bundle sheath

The fitting procedure estimated four free variables. Mesophyll conductance to  CO2 was treated as a temperature-invariant parameter. The maxi-
mum activities for Cyt  b6f and Rubisco were scaled from the measurement temperatures to a reference temperature of 25 °C. The bundle sheath 
allocation was treated as a single parameter representing fractional allocation of absorptance, Cyt  b6f, and Rubisco to the bundle sheath. Pairwise

drives diffusive transport of glycine into the bundle sheath 
(Rawsthorne and Hylton 1991; Leegood and von Caemmerer 
1994) and increases the efficiency of  CO2 fixation by the 
bundle sheath Rubisco (Moore et al. 1987b; Keerberg et al. 
2014). However, the activity of GDC is coordinated with the 
activity of serine hydroxymethyl transferase such that the 
overall products of glycine decarboxylation include serine, 
 NH3, and NADH, in addition to  CO2 (Woo and Osmond 
1976; Sarojini and Oliver 1983). While this implies that 
serine,  NH3, NADH, and/or stoichiometrically equivalent 
products of their metabolism must return from the bundle 
sheath to the mesophyll, it is not yet clear which mechanisms 
maintain carbon, nitrogen, and redox balance (Rawsthorne 
et al. 1988a, 1992; Leegood and von Caemmerer 1994; 
Mallmann et al. 2014; Schlüter et al. 2017).
Since  NH3 can escape to the atmosphere (Farquhar et al. 
1980b; Johnson and Berry 2013), it seems likely that it is 
reassimilated in the bundle sheath via glutamine synthetase 
and/or glutamate synthase (Rawsthorne et al. 1988b, 1992; 
Monson and Rawsthorne 2000). If this occurs, then the 
glycine shuttle could either: (i) create an additional ATP 
demand in the bundle sheath (i.e.,  NH3 reassimilated in bun-
dle sheath chloroplasts by glutamine synthetase alone); and/
or (ii) create an additional ATP, NADPH, and Fd demand 
in the bundle sheath (i.e.,  NH3 reassimilated in bundle 
sheath chloroplasts by glutamine synthetase and glutamate 
synthase). In theory, these energetic demands could poten-
tially be satisfied by several different energy-balancing 
mechanisms: (iii) a shift in the balance of linear and cyclic 
electron flow within the bundle sheath chloroplasts; (iv) 
a shift in the balance of NADH oxidation via the malate 
valve, cytochrome oxidase, and alternative oxidase pathways 
within the bundle sheath mitochondria; and/or (v) shuttling 
of 3-phosphoglyceric acid and dihydroxyacetone phosphate 
between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. Considering 
the range of candidate mechanisms from a stoichiometric 
perspective indicates that there is potential for interactions 
between the fate of  NH3 and the fate of NADH within the 
glycine shuttle, and also for interactions between the glycine, 
aspartate, and malate shuttles (e.g., Mallmann et al. 2014; 
Bellasio 2017; Schlüter and Weber 2020). However, it is not 
yet clear which of these interactions actually play out.
To explore the ecological context for these biochemical 
interactions, we parameterized the photosynthesis model 
with the fitted values of the physiological variables from the 
Diamond Y Spring Preserve (Table  3) and then simulated 
Type I  C3–C4 photosynthesis at this site over one day in July 
(Fig. 7). For simplicity, the leaf temperature was prescribed 
as equivalent to air temperature, and mesophyll  CO2 and 
 O2 were prescribed as 250 /u1D707bar and 210 mbar, respectively 
(i.e., omitting the dynamic coupling between photosyn-
thesis, stomatal conductance, and the energy balance). All 
other input parameters were as given in Table  2. With this 
approach, the diel cycle of light and temperature (Fig.  7a) 
determines the limits of the potential rates of electron trans-
port (Fig.  7b). From these limits, CEF1 (Fig.  7c), NPQ of 
PS II (Fig. 7d), and PC of Cyt  b6f (Fig. 7e) then regulate the 
actual linear electron flow to a rate that remains coordinated 
with the capacity of carbon metabolism to provide electron 
acceptors (Fig.  7f). These dynamics illustrate both chal-
lenges and opportunities for bundle sheath assimilation of 
 NH3 via glutamine synthetase and/or glutamate synthase. In 
particular, the small fractional allocation of photosynthetic 
capacity to the bundle sheath implies that reassimilation of 
mesophyll-derived  NH3 would be likely to dominate the 
bundle sheath energy budget. While the increased ATP to 
Fd and NADPH ratio associated with glutamine synthetase 
activity could potentially be met through increased CEF1, 
it could also be limited by decreased coupling efficiency 
at high temperatures. Alternatively, a decreased coupling 
efficiency might permit the chloroplast chain to support the 
increased Fd and NADPH to ATP ratio associated with glu-
tamate synthase activity. In either case, the bundle sheath 
would be likely to make the most efficient use of the avail-
able light under conditions where state transitions optimize 
the absorption cross-sections of PS I and PS II (i.e., without 
wasting absorbed light through the heat-dissipating forms of 
non-photochemical quenching) such that electrons flow to 
the sink at the maximum possible rate (i.e., without inducing 
PC of Cyt  b6f).
In this context, it is intriguing to consider whether the 
malate and aspartate shuttles might have originally func -
tioned to smooth out the energy supply and demand associ-
ated with the glycine shuttle, and thereby to maintain the 
bundle sheath in an energetically balanced state. If this is 
the case, it would imply that the  CO2-concentrating func-
tion of the malate and aspartate shuttles was not the rea-
son for their origin (i.e., much like the spandrels of San 
Marco; Gould and Lewontin 1979). Such a hypothesis can 
be explored quantitatively if the chloroplast and mitochon-
drial electron transport chains are conceptualized as part of 
a single, interactive system that balances energy supply and 
demand, subject to the inherent kinetic limits of each chain 
and the manner in which they are regulated. The model we 
have described here provides a framework for performing 
this type of analysis and determining which combinations 
of potential interactions actually operate in vivo in different 
plants and under different environmental conditions. Since 
Flaveria chloraefolia co-exists with  C3 and  C4 competitors 
at the Diamond Y Spring and the Blue Hole Ciénega, fur -
ther study of these communities may provide insight into 
the mechanisms of competitive coexistence and whether the 
ecological conditions here allow the Type I  C3–C4 pathway 
to represent an evolutionarily stable strategy. In a global

Conclusions
1. We have developed a quantitative model of  C3,  C3–C4 
intermediate, and  C4 photosynthesis that relates the fac-
tors limiting electron transport and carbon metabolism, 
the regulatory processes that coordinate these metabolic 
domains, and the overall responses to light, carbon diox-
ide, and temperature. The model describes the steady-
state responses of leaf-level photosynthesis to these 
environmental factors within the ranges of conditions 
that leaves have acclimated to during growth.
2. This framework has three unique features. First, mech-
anistic expressions describe how the Cytochrome  b6f 
complex controls electron transport in mesophyll and 
bundle sheath chloroplasts. Second, the mesophyll and 
bundle sheath expressions are coupled in a way that rep-
resents how feedback regulation of Cyt  b6f coordinates 
electron transport and carbon metabolism. Third, the 
temperature sensitivity of Cyt  b6f is differentiated from 
that of the coupling between NADPH, Fd, and ATP pro-
duction.
3. Using this framework, we have presented simulations 
demonstrating that the unique light dependence of 
the  CO2 compensation point in  C3–C4 leaves can be 
explained by co-occurrence of light-saturation in the 
mesophyll and light-limitation in the bundle sheath. We 
have also presented inversions demonstrating that pop-
ulation-level variation in the  CO2 compensation point 
in a Type I  C3–C4 species, Flaveria chloraefolia, can 
be explained by variable allocation of photosynthetic 
capacity to the bundle sheath.
4. While there are substantial uncertainties about how the 
glycine shuttle works, this  CO2-concentrating mecha-
nism is likely to provide advantages in the net  CO2 
assimilation rate and resource-use efficiencies under 
some combinations of light,  CO2, and temperature, and 
disadvantages under others.  C3–C4 intermediate plants 
may optimize pigment and protein distributions to maxi-
mize the benefits and minimize the costs of glycine shut-
tling under different environmental conditions.
5. Understanding this optimization quantitatively holds 
promise for explaining why the Type I  C3–C4 pathway 
occupies such a key place in evolutionary history and 
yet remains so ecologically rare. It also holds promise 
for explaining the functional relationships between the 
glycine, malate, and aspartate shuttles, and evaluating 
the hypothesis that the  C4 pathway originally evolved 
to smooth out energy supply and demand, rather than to 
concentrate  CO2.
