ABSTRACT
The nicotinamide cofactors including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphate (NADP) play 
important roles in facilitating redox reactions for energy metabolism and biosynthesis. To expand the cofactor 
menu, a non-natural cofactor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) has been introduced recently. The 
reduced forms of these cofactors carry reducing equivalents that are essential for cellular metabolism. However, 
there is a long standing challenge to rationally transfer reducing equivalent from one cofactor to another, albeit 
such process is highly demanding in metabolic engineering. This study develops a new approach based on malic 
enzyme (ME)-mediated transhydrogenation to enable reducing equivalents exchange among different cofactors. 
We used wild-type ME, MaeB and an engineered ME* that favors NAD, NADP and NCD, respectively, to 
demonstrate such conversions. When an in vitro system initiated with equal amount of NADH and NCD in the 
presence of ME, ME* and excess amount of pyruvate was held for 2 h, up to 65 % NADH was consumed and 57 % 
NCDH was generated. When implemented into NCD self-sufficient Escherichia coli cells, the system directed 
reducing equivalents toward NCDH-linked formation of lactate. Overall, this work offers an effective strategy to 
regulate intracellular reducing equivalents that may serve as a novel tool for metabolic engineering and synthetic 
biology.
1. Introduction
Nicotinamide cofactors including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NAD), NAD 2 ′ -phosphate (NADP) and their corresponding reduced 
forms, NADH and NADPH, are integral to cellular metabolism in facili -
tating redox reactions for energy production and biosynthesis [ 1 ]. These 
cofactors are not only essential for enzyme catalysis but also play a 
critical role in regulating cellular processes such as growth, differenti -
ation, and stress responses [ 2 ]. NAD primarily supports catabolic re -
actions, where it facilitates the oxidation of substrates to generate 
energy, while NADP is predominantly involved in anabolic processes for 
the synthesis of key biomolecules such as fatty acids, amino acids and 
nucleotides [ 3 ]. To expand the cofactor menu, non-natural cofactors 
that mimic the function of natural cofactors but with altered structures 
have been explored recently [ 4 , 5 ]. These non-natural cofactors are 
typically more stable and less expensive. Meanwhile, non-natural 
cofactors may be used to allocate reducing equivalents, modulate re -
action thermodynamics, and ultimately improve product yields, pre -
senting substantial advantages in synthetic biology and 
biomanufacturing [ 6 – 8 ]. In particular, nicotinamide cytosine dinucle -
otide (NCD, Fig. 1 A) has been found with good biocompatibility, and 
several enzymes have been engineered to favor NCD, including malic 
enzyme [ 9 ], lactate dehydrogenase [ 10 ], formate dehydrogenase [ 11 ], 
formaldehyde dehydrogenase [ 12 ], and P450 BM3 [ 13 ].
The NADH/NAD and NADPH/NADP ratios are sensitive biochemical 
indexes for cellular metabolism and the cell redox state [ 14 ]. During the 
catabolic processes, NAD acts as an electron acceptor, stripping elec -
trons from the metabolic substrates to form NADH, which then transfer 
electrons to oxygen or other electron acceptors, thus cells typically 
maintain a lower NADH/NAD ratio. On the other hand, anabolic pro -
cesses require a higher NADPH/NADP ratio, as NADPH serves as a 
reducing agent in biosynthetic pathways, enabling the construction of

complex molecules from simpler precursors [ 15 ]. Therefore, it is 
important to allocate the reducing equivalents for optimal flux of me -
tabolites toward a desired pathway [ 16 ]. Furthermore, the non-specific 
delivery of reducing equivalents may derail metabolic processes, 
resulting in excess by-products. The dynamic equilibrium of NADH/ -
NAD and NADPH/NADP ratios can be achieved by modulating the ac -
tivities of key enzymes, utilizing distinct cofactors for substrate-level 
phosphorylation, transferring hydrogen anion between NAD and NADP, 
and other mechanisms.
Despite tremendous efforts in developing tools to regulate NAD(P)H/ 
NAD(P) ratios, challenges remain in effectively catalyze the intercon -
version between NADH and NADPH. So far, transhydrogenase [ 17 , 18 ], 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [ 19 ], and glutamate dehy -
drogenase [ 20 , 21 ] have been explored to regulate cellular NAD(P)H 
levels in metabolic engineering. Moreover, with the introduction of 
non-natural cofactors, it appears interesting to establish the trans -
hydrogenation process between natural and non-natural cofactors. For 
instance, when rapid or excessive carbon source uptake triggers over -
flow metabolism, where reducing equivalents and carbon flux are 
sequestered into undesirable byproducts. This metabolic imbalance may 
be strategically resolved by redirection of reducing equivalents into 
target pathways mediated by non-natural cofactors. While such pro -
cesses are highly demanding in metabolic engineering and synthetic 
biology, to date, transhydrogenases have never been characterized or 
engineered for recognition of non-natural redox cofactors [ 22 – 24 ]. In 
the absence of known cellular enzymatic mechanisms bridging natural 
and non-natural cofactors for the transfer of reducing equivalents, 
alternative strategies are essential to overcome this limitation and 
enable orthogonal provision of reductive equivalents.
This study aims to develop a new transhydrogenation tool to facili -
tate reducing equivalents transfer between different redox cofactor 
pairs, with a particular focus on transhydrogenation between natural 
and non-natural cofactors. We employed malic enzymes with distinct 
cofactor specificities, including NAD-dependent ME [ 25 ], 
NCD-dependent ME* [ 9 ] (ME mutant with L310R/Q401C), and 
NADP-dependent MaeB [ 26 ], as functional components. Pyruvate, CO
2 
and L -malate serve as intermediate substrates for the transhydrogenation 
process, where L -malate acts as a carrier molecule for hydride in the 
transfer of reducing equivalents between distinct cofactors ( Fig. 1 B). 
Because pyruvate is a central metabolite at relatively high concentra -
tions [ 27 ], for example, over 3.0 mM in Escherichia coli cells and 8.0 mM 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, it can provide a driving force for the 
oxidative half of the process and receive electrons from the reduced 
cofactor X – H.
to form L -malate. In the reductive half of the process, L -malate de -
livers hydride to the oxidized cofactor Y to form YH. Thus, the net result 
of this system may be used to direct the reducing equivalents towards 
YH-linked reactions or pathways. It is noteworthy that this reduction 
equivalents transfer can occur between natural cofactors and non- 
natural cofactors. In in vitro experiments, our results demonstrated 
that the ME-mediated transhydrogenation promoted efficient hydrogen 
transfer from one cofactor to another one. By implementing this system 
into NCD self-sufficient E. coli cells [ 28 ], we found that NCDH-linked 
formation of lactate was enhanced likely because reducing equivalents 
carried by natural cofactors were transferred to form NCDH ( Fig. 1 C). 
Overall, this work offers an effective strategy to regulate intracellular 
reducing equivalents that may serve as a novel tool in the fields of 
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

and 0.5 mM NAD, NCD, or NADP. The enzyme activity was monitored by 
measuring the absorbance at 340 nm using a microplate spectropho -
tometer (Bio-Tek, VT, USA), with continuous absorbance tracking 
throughout the assay. One unit of pure enzyme activity was defined as 
the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the production of 1 μ mol

2 mM oxidative cofactor, 2 mM reductive cofactor, 0 – 100 mM pyruvate, 
100 mM NaHCO

chromatographic-grade methanol was added to the system to a final 
concentration of 80 %. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and 
error bars show standard deviation.

C with 
shaking at 200 rpm. To stop the reaction, 4 vol of the quenching buffer 
(prepared in a 1:1 v/v methanol:acetonitrile mixture) was added, 
resulting in the sample being preserved in methanol: acetonitrile: water 
at a final ratio of 2:2:1 ( v/v/v ). The samples were then centrifuged at

triplicate, and error bars show standard deviation.
2.10. Resting cells enzymatic activities determination
To determine the enzymatic activity of crude cell extracts from 
engineered strains, 2 × 10
10 
cells were harvested and lysed in 0.2 mL of 
cell lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM MgCl
2
, 0.1

USA), with continuous absorbance tracking throughout the assay. One 
unit of crude enzyme activity was defined as the production of 1 μ mol 
formazan per min. All assays were performed in triplicate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. ME-mediated transhydrogenation
This study designed a hydrogen transfer system mediated by distinct 
cofactor-dependent malic enzymes, in which the reversible reaction of 
pyruvate conversion to malate serves as a bridge to facilitate trans -
hydrogenation between different cofactors. On one hand, pyruvate 
serves as a vital intermediate for the interconversion of diverse sub -
stances across all living organisms, with a substantial concentration 
present within cells. On the other hand, both pyruvate and malate 
demonstrate exceptional biocompatibility. Additionally, we have ob -
tained well-characterized malic enzymes with different cofactor de -
pendencies as components of our hydrogen transfer system, including 
NAD-dependent ME [ 25 ], NCD-dependent ME* [ 9 ] (ME mutant with 
L310R/Q401C), and NADP-dependent MaeB [ 26 ], which are all native 
or derivative proteins of E. coli , minimizing the possibility of low 
expression during recombinant protein production [ 33 ]. This approach 
could facilitate transhydrogenation between NAD, NADP, and the 
non-natural cofactor NCD ( Figs. 1 and 2 A).
We expressed and purified three types of malic enzymes (ME, ME*, 
and MaeB), each of which demonstrated a clear preference for NAD, 
NCD, or NADP, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. 2 B. Specif -
ically, the activity of ME towards NAD was 24.15 U/mg, the activity of 
ME* towards NCD was 2.23 U/mg, and the activity of MaeB towards 
NADP was 0.72 U/mg. ME exhibited the highest activity towards NAD 
and weak activity towards NCD and NADP, whereas neither ME* or 
MaeB activity was detected for the other two cofactors. These enzymes 
provide the necessary components for the ME-mediated 
transhydrogenation.
3.2. Transhydrogenation in vitro
To verify the feasibility of our design, we first conducted catalytic 
experiments for hydrogen transfer between any two of the cofactors

using purified proteins. In these catalytic reactions, half of the trans -
hydrogenation processes was mainly driven by reduced cofactors and 
pyruvate/CO
2 
from substrates, while the other half depended on 
oxidizing cofactors and the thermodynamic favorability of malate 
oxidation and decarboxylation to pyruvate/CO
2
. To ensure the avail -
ability of CO

for facilitating the transhydrogenation reaction, we sup -
plemented the reaction system with sodium bicarbonate to increase the

concentration. Reactions were conducted at 37

min in a mixture containing 100 mM HEPES, 2 mM oxidative cofactor, 2 
mM reductive cofactor, 50 mM pyruvate, 100 mM NaHCO

, 2 mM MgCl
2 
and 0.2 U/mL of each malic enzyme, pH 7.5. We employed a short 
abbreviation to denote transhydrogenation reaction from one cofactor 
to the other: Pa is used for the transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD 
(NADPH + NAD → NADP + NADH), Ap for NADH to NADP (NADH +
NADP → NAD + NADPH), Pc for NADPH to NCD (NADPH + NCD → 
NADP + NCDH), Cp for NCDH to NADP (NCDH + NADP → NCD +
NADPH), Ca for NCDH to NAD (NCDH + NAD → NCD + NADH), and Ac 
for NADH to NCD (NADH + NCD → NAD + NCDH). HPLC analysis 
demonstrated successful and efficient hydrogen transfer between NAD, 
NCD, and NADP, achieving hydrogenation conversions ranging from 40 
% to 80 %, as shown in Fig. 2 C. Specifically, the conversions for Ap 
(NADH + NADP → NAD + NADPH) and Ac (NADH + NCD → NAD +
NCDH) were 76.9 % and 65.9 %, respectively. Notably, the NO ENZYME 
groups without any malic enzyme only exhibited less than 10 % con -
version. This demonstrates the feasibility of employing malic enzymes to 
mediate hydrogen transfer, thereby enabling controlled utilization of 
both natural and non-natural cofactors in redox reactions.
The reversible interconversion between pyruvate and malate serves 
as a bridge linking transhydrogenation. Consequently, the initial con -
centration of pyruvate influences the rate of hydrogen transfer. As 
anticipated, after 120 min of reaction with 0.5 mM pyruvate, the 
hydride conversion of the ME & ME* group was 21.8 %. As the pyruvate 
concentration gradually increased, under the same conditions, the hy -
dride conversion of the ME & ME* group reached 72.5 % when 100 mM 
pyruvate was used. The conversion increased with the concentration of 
pyruvate, as shown in Fig. 3 A, which indicated that pyruvate enhanced 
the efficiency of the transhydrogenation.
Subsequently, we examined the variation of hydride conversion ef -
ficiency over time. Referencing the concentrations of pyruvate in typical 
E. coli and yeast cells, which were estimated around 4 mM and 9 mM, 
respectively [ 27 ], as well as the fact that pyruvate can reach up to 50 
mM or higher in engineered strains, we separately assessed the effi -
ciency of hydrogen transfer under conditions of 5 mM and 50 mM py -
ruvate. At a pyruvate concentration of 50 mM, the transhydrogenation 
(Ac, NADH + NCD → NAD + NCDH) reached nearly maximal conversion 
of 66 % after 60 min, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 B. However, when the 
pyruvate concentration was 5 mM, the hydride conversion continued to 
increase over a 2-h period, reaching a conversion of 53.8 % at 120 min. 
This observation further supports the notion that higher concentrations 
of pyruvate accelerate the reaction towards equilibrium. All of above 
indicated that the reaction proceeded efficiently, with the system 
achieving a steady state in a relatively short time frame, making it 
suitable for use in dynamic metabolic processes.
To further verify that the cooperation of two malic enzymes is 
necessary for electron transfer between natural and non-natural redox 
cofactors, we evaluated the hydrogen transfer efficiency with only one 
of malic enzymes present. As shown in Fig. 3 C and D, the ME & ME* 
group containing both ME and ME* exhibited the highest hydrogen 
transfer efficiency after 60 min. In the Ac reaction (NADH + NCD → 
NAD + NCDH), the ME & ME* group demonstrated that 43.2 % and 57.6 
% of NCD were reduced to NCDH at 5 mM and 50 mM pyruvate, 
respectively. It was much higher than the ME or ME* groups (each

containing a single malic enzyme), where the reduction of NCD to NCDH 
remained below 15 %. A similar trend was observed in the Ca reaction 
(NCDH + NAD → NCD + NADH): 48.0 % (5 mM pyruvate) and 54.7 % 
(50 mM pyruvate) of NAD was reduced to NADH in the ME & ME* group, 
while the ME or ME* groups showed only about 10 % – 15 % reduction of 
NAD to NADH. Meanwhile, we observed that in the ME* group of Ca 
reaction (NCDH + NAD → NCD + NADH), 15.0 % (5 mM pyruvate) and 
37.5 % (50 mM pyruvate) of NCDH were oxidized to NCD, but only 
about 9.2 % and 13.1 % of NAD were reduced to NADH, respectively. In 
addition to the spontaneous oxidation of NCDH, a critical issue might be 
the trapping of reducing power in malate due to the absence of an 
enzyme that utilizes NAD, resulting in incomplete transfer of reducing 
power from NCDH to NADH. A similar issue might exist in the ME group 
of Ac reactions. However, since ME had noticeable capacity for NCD 
utilization, the retention of reducing power was less pronounced. In the 
ME & ME* group of the Ca reaction, the presence of enzymes that utilize 
both NAD(H) and NCD(H) reduced the retention of reducing power 
among intermediate products. In this group, 47.1 % (5 mM pyruvate) 
and 59.3 % (50 mM pyruvate) of NCDH were oxidized to NCD, with 
48.0 % and 54.7 % of NAD reduced to NADH. These results confirmed 
that the combination of both malic enzymes is crucial for overall effi -
ciency of the transhydrogenation reaction. In contrast, when only one 
type of malic enzyme — either ME or ME* — was present, the trans -
hydrogenation efficiency was considerably lower, even if the same total 
enzyme activity units were added. Taken together, our observations 
highlighted the synergistic nature of combining different malic enzymes 
for a high-yield cofactor-specific transhydrogenation.
These findings indicated that the ME-mediated transhydrogenation 
can efficiently promote hydrogen transfer between natural or non- 
natural nicotinamide cofactors. Furthermore, the intermediate sub -
strates and cooperation between malic enzyme components are essential 
for efficient transhydrogenation. By altering the combination of en -
zymes, the varieties of cofactors regeneration can be further expanded. 
Regulating the energy flow between these cofactors opens up new ave -
nues for optimizing metabolic fluxes, especially in the production of 
valuable compounds through engineered microorganisms in synthetic 
biology.
3.3. Biosynthesis of lactate regulated by the ME-mediated 
transhydrogenation in vivo
D -lactate, a versatile industrial chemical monomer, is produced by 
microorganisms through the catalytic reduction of pyruvate by D -lactate 
dehydrogenase (DLDH), typically utilizing nicotinamide cofactors as 
reducing agents in this process. Liu et al. engineered an NCD-preferring 
DLDH* (V152R/N213E mutant from Lactobacillus helveticus) [ 10 ]. We 
analyzed the kinetics of DLDH* toward NADH, NCDH, and NADPH, as 
shown in Table S3 . The results demonstrated that its catalytic efficiency 
value ( k
cat
/ K
m
) for NCDH was approximately 9-fold and 255-fold higher 
than that for NADH and NADPH, respectively. The K
m 
value for NCDH 
was only 0.0711 mM, whereas those for NADH and NADPH were 
impractically high at 4.84 mM and 2.11 mM, respectively. These data 
indicated that DLDH* prefers NCDH over NADH or NADPH to catalyze 
lactate synthesis in vivo . Based on this, the ME-mediated trans -
hydrogenation has the potential to regulate the D -lactate production 
driven by NCDH in cells ( Fig. 4 A).
To validate the regulation of lactate biosynthesis by the ME- 
mediated transhydrogenation in vivo , four E. coli strains THB1, THB2, 
THB3 and THB4 were constructed, as shown in Table S1 . To avoid 
interference from lactate synthesized by the strain itself in experimental 
analysis, BW25113( △ ldhA , dld::cat ) [ 28 ] with endogenous lactate de -
hydrogenase knocked out was used as the host for lactate biosynthesis. 
The strain THB1 contains NCD synthesis module, ME-mediated trans -
hydrogenation module (ME and ME*), and lactate production module 
(DLDH*). To balance the activities of ME, ME*, and DLDH*, ME was 
cloned onto a low-copy plasmid, whereas ME* and DLDH* which have 
relatively low activity compared to ME, have been cloned onto a plasmid 
with high copy number to achieve higher levels of protein expression 
( Fig. 4 B). Compared to THB1, strain THB2 lacks their corresponding 
genes for ME and ME*, whereas THB3 and THB4 lacks genes responsible 
for the NCD module and DLDH*, respectively. Resting E. coli cells were 
used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ME-mediated trans -
hydrogenation in vivo. Notably, THB4 exhibited undetectable D -lactate 
production under the same conditions (with glucose feeding and glyc -
erol feeding), confirming that D -lactate synthesis was mediated by 
DLDH*. Other results from THB4 were not displayed or analyzed 
further.
We detected the NCD- and NAD-linked activities of both malic 
enzyme (ME) and D -lactate dehydrogenase (DLDH) in the crude extracts 
of the engineered strains. THB1 and THB3 exhibited ME activity as ex -
pected. In contrast, THB2, which lacked expression of additional ME or 
ME*, displayed minimal ME activity ( Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, it was 
found that THB1, THB2 and THB3 all exhibited DLDH activity towards 
NCD, with specific activities of 0.35 × 10

, respectively ( Fig. 5 B). DLDH* showed 
a strong preference for NCD in the cell, enabling it to effectively utilize 
NCDH regenerated by the ME-mediated transhydrogenation for lactate 
production. Notably, the activity of DLDH* in THB1 was relatively low,

presumably due to resource limitations arising from the overexpression 
of various other proteins in this strain.
As a next step, D -lactate production of engineered E. coli strains was 
evaluated using resting cells. Experiments were conducted with 100 mM 
glucose or glycerol as the substrate at pH 7.5, 37 
◦
C, and 200 rpm 
shaking. We evaluated the consumption of carbon sources (glucose or 
glycerol) and the production of D -lactate. Meanwhile, when glucose was 
used, we also assessed the level of acetic acid, an important byproduct 
generated during lactate synthesis from glucose by E. coli .
As an easily utilizable substrate, glucose can provide NADH to cells 
rapidly. We detected the levels of nicotamide cofactors in the engineered 
strains ( Fig. 5 C). It revealed that THB1 had 1.13 mM NAD(H) and 0.98 
mM NCD(H), and THB2 had 1.66 mM NAD(H) and 0.62 mM NCD(H) at 
30 min of resting cell biotransformation. Both THB1 and THB2 produced 
significant amounts of NCD(H) as expected. THB3 had 1.79 mM NAD 
(H), and no NCD(H) was detected as expected. NADP(H) levels were 
comparable across all engineered strains, with total concentrations of 
approximately 0.35 mM. In THB1, the NCDH concentration reached 
0.26 mM with an NCDH/NCD ratio of 0.37, whereas THB2 exhibited 
only 0.10 mM NCDH and an NCDH/NCD ratio of 0.20. Given that DLDH 
exhibits a K
m 
of 0.07 mM for NCDH, the intracellular NCDH concen -
tration could theoretically provide the driving force for lactate pro -
duction. Further analysis of the NCDH/NCD ratio during resting cell 
catalysis revealed a higher proportion of NCDH in THB1 compared to 
THB2 ( Fig. S3A ), indicating that the ME-mediated transhydrogenation 
facilitated reducing power transfer to NCDH.
When glucose was used, at 4 h, THB1 consumed 20.1 mM glucose 
and accumulated 10.8 mM D -lactate, achieving a theoretical yield of 
27.0 %. In comparison, THB2 consumed 27.7 mM glucose and accu -
mulated 7.1 mM D -lactate, with a theoretical yield of 12.9 %. And THB3 
consumed 29.1 mM glucose and accumulated 8.7 mM D -lactate, reaching 
a theoretical yield of 14.9 %. Meanwhile, the accumulation of acetic acid 
in the three engineered strains were 2.13 mM, 4.64 mM and 4.08 mM, 
respectively ( Fig. 5 E). Compared to THB2 and THB3, the D -lactate 
accumulation and yield of THB1 was significantly increased, while the 
byproduct acetic acid was reduced. This indicates that the ME-mediated 
transhydrogenation effectively directed carbon flux towards the NCD- 
mediated lactate pathway. Despite the absence of the ME-mediated

transhydrogenation module or NCD synthesis module, THB2 and THB3 
still had considerable D -lactate accumulation. This might be due mainly 
to the residual activity of DLDH* towards NADH, and to a lesser extent 
to interactions with other unknown metabolic processes involving the 
redox couple NCD/NCDH, as evidenced by the detection of NCDH in 
THB2.
In addition, we also use glycerol, which is surplus in biodiesel pro -
duction, as the substrate for D -lactate production. Importantly, glycerol 
exhibits a thermodynamically favorable standard redox potential for 
reducing pyruvate [ 34 , 35 ]. Moreover, glycerol is a more efficient elec -
tron donor as it can be readily converted to DHAP for lactate production 
without dissipating reducing equivalents to other electron acceptors 
through multiple intermediate steps that are commonly required to 
metabolize other substrates like glucose. Two alternative routes have 
been reported for DHAP formation in E. coli [ 36 ]: the 
GlpK-GlpD/GlpABC route under respiratory conditions and the 
GldA-DhaKLM route under fermentative conditions. When glycerol is 
converted to pyruvate through the GldA-DhaKLM route, the NADH 
generated exceeds that required for the synthesis of D -lactate from py -
ruvate. This excess NADH can theoretically accumulate within the cell, 
driving the ME-mediated transhydrogenation to produce NCDH and 
ultimately promoting lactate synthesis. Similar to the cofactor profiles 
under glucose conditions, comparable NCD(H) levels were detected in 
both THB1 and THB2, with THB1 exhibiting a higher NCDH/NCD ratio 
( Fig. 5 D and Fig. S3B ). Under glycerol conditions, the NCDH of THB1 
was 0.24 mM with an NCDH/NCD ratio of 0.45, whereas THB2 had only 
0.13 mM and an NCDH/NCD ratio of 0.26 at 30 min of resting cell 
catalysis. Furthermore, our observations revealed that THB1 exhibited a 
notably higher lactate production compared to THB2 and THB3. As 
shown in Fig. 5 F, at 4 h, THB1 consumed 15.3 mM glycerol and accu -
mulated 12.0 mM D -lactate, achieving a theoretical yield of 78.6 %. In 
comparison, THB2 consumed 15.9 mM glycerol and accumulated 9.6 
mM D -lactate, with a theoretical yield of 60.5 %. Meanwhile, THB3 
consumed 14.9 mM glycerol and accumulated 7.2 mM D -lactate, 
reaching a theoretical yield of only 48.3 %.
Since previous tests showed no significant differences in cofactor 
levels between THB1 and THB2, and the activity of DLDH in THB2 and 
THB3 was much higher than THB1, we attribute the increased of D - 
lactate production and yield in THB1 in both substrates to the ME- 
mediated transhydrogenation. This system enabled the trans -
hydrogenation between NADH and NCD in vivo , resulting in the for -
mation of NCDH, which was utilized by DLDH* to enhance lactate 
production, meanwhile decreasing the byproduct acetic acid. This sug -
gests that the ME-mediated transhydrogenation efficiently transfers 
reducing equivalents to the NCD-mediated lactate pathway, thereby 
promoting the production of D -lactate in vivo . The results demonstrate 
the critical role of the ME-mediated transhydrogenation in optimizing 
reducing equivalents utilization and directing metabolic flux toward 
lactate production. The synergy between non-natural cofactor-mediated 
bioorthogonal system and the ME-mediated transhydrogenation holds 
great promise for metabolic engineering applications targeting 
biochemicals.
We have demonstrated that elevated pyruvate concentrations could 
enhance the efficiency of ME-mediated transhydrogenation in vitro ; 
therefore, optimizing pyruvate level should augment the system ’ s 
functionality in vivo . Alternatively, the efficiency may be enhanced by 
improving intracellular CO
2 
availability. CO
2 
is produced by E. coli 
through a variety of means, like TCA cycle, pyruvate-formate lyase, and 
the pentose phosphate pathways. Potential strategies for enhancing CO
2 
availability include optimizing the fermentation process of microbial 
strains or introducing carbonic anhydrase to catalyze the reversible 
conversion between HCO
3
 
and CO
2 
[ 37 , 38 ]. Furthermore, previous 
studies employed sacrificial regeneration systems (such as phosphite or 
formate) to drive energy for non-natural cofactors mediated pathways 
[ 11 , 39 , 40 ], however, the inherent metabolic burden imposed by these 
exogenous reducing agents may limit their practical applicability in 
cells. In contrast, the ME-mediated transhydrogenation offers advan -
tages in directing reducing equivalents for specific utilization. These 
strategies may integrate to achieve complementary functionalities in the 
future, and such hybrid systems could potentially address the limitations 
of individual approaches, broadening the application possibilities of 
non-natural cofactors in synthetic biology.
4. Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of using ME-mediated trans -
hydrogenation as a novel approach for precise regulation of redox co -
factors in metabolic engineering. By facilitating the dynamic exchange 
of reducing equivalents between natural nicotinamide cofactors and the 
non-natural one NCD, this system enables directing the reducing power 
into redox reactions of interest, without a complete dependence on 
native cofactors, thereby preserving their role in essential biological 
processes. We tested three types of malic enzymes with distinct cofactor 
specificities, namely, wild-type ME, ME* and MaeB preferring NAD, 
NCD and NADP, respectively, to facilitate transhydrogenation, and 
demonstrated an efficient transfer of reducing equivalents between 
different malic enzyme pairs, highlighting the flexibility and precision of 
this system in regulating energy fluxes within cells.
In vitro experiments confirmed the successful hydrogen transfer be -
tween various nicotinamide cofactors, enabling efficient hydride con -
version. Subsequently, we found the intermediate substrate pyruvate 
boosts transhydrogenation. More importantly, the synergy between 
specific malic enzymes dependent on distinct cofactors is essential to 
mediate transhydrogenation from natural to non-natural cofactors. 
When ME-based system was applied in vivo , we observed a significant 
increase in D -lactate production. When glucose was used, the D -lactate 
titer was 1.52 times higher than that of the control, with a 14.1 % in -
crease in yield and a decrease in byproducts. Similarly, when glycerol 
was used, the D -lactate titer was 1.45 times that of the control, and the 
yield increased by 18.1 %. This demonstrates that the ME-mediated 
transhydrogenation effectively directs reducing equivalent towards 
target products, thereby improving metabolic precision and efficiency.
Overall, this work presents ME-mediated transhydrogenation as a 
powerful tool for optimizing metabolic processes. Besides the conver -
sion of NADH to NCDH to drive lactate production in this study, the 
approach may be applied to dynamically regulate the balance between 
other natural or non-natural redox cofactors, thus averting adverse im -
pacts on growth and metabolism caused by inappropriate distribution of 
reducing power. The ability to manipulate natural and non-natural co -
factors opens new possibilities for enhancing the production of high- 
value biochemicals and optimizing redox biocatalysis in synthetic 
biology and engineered microbial systems.
