Fusion enzymes are attractive tools for facilitating the assembly
of biocatalytic cascades for chemical synthesis. This approach
can offer great advantages for cooperative redox cascades that
need the constant supply of a donor molecule. In this work, we
have developed a self-sufficient bifunctional enzyme that can
be coupled to transaminase-catalyzed reactions for the efficient
recycling of the amino donor (L-alanine). By genetic fusion of
an alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH) and a formate dehydrogen-
ase (FDH), a redox-complementary system was applied to
recycle the amino donor and the cofactor (NADH), respectively.
AlaDH and FDH were assembled in both combinations (FDH-
AlaDH and AlaDH-FDH), with a 2.5-fold higher enzymatic
activity of the latter system. Then, AlaDH-FDH was coupled to
two different S-selective transaminases for the synthesis of
vanillyl amine (10 mM) reaching up to 99 % conversion in 24 h
in both cases. Finally, the multienzyme system was reused for at
least 3 consecutive cycles when implemented in dialysis-
assisted biotransformations.
Introduction
Amine transaminases (ATAs, EC 2.6.1.-) have attracted consid-
erable interest in their use as biocatalysts for the enantioselec-
tive synthesis of valuable chiral amine compounds, which are
widespread within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fine
chemical industry.
[1–7]
Nonetheless, the insufficient stability of
ATAs under operating conditions still constitutes a major hurdle
for industrial applications.
[8]
An excess of the amine donor is
often required to shift the unfavorable reaction equilibrium
towards the production of the desired amine, but this may be
detrimental for the enzyme.
[9]
The high concentration of amino
donor may cause monomer dissociation, unfolding, and irrever-
sible protein aggregation.
[8,10]
Furthermore, the need for a
constant supply of amino donor reduces the cost-efficiency and
sustainability of the enzymatic process. The use of smart amine
donors has been an excellent step forward but not all ATAs
accept those substrates and the byproduct needs to be dealt
with.
[11]
When simple amine donors are used, the enzyme can suffer
from inhibition of the generated aldehydes or keto acids such
as pyruvate.
[10]
In these cases, several methods have been
developed to displace the equilibrium and avoid byproduct
inhibition such as the coupling of a second enzyme. Lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) had been combined with an ATA using
alanine as amino donor to convert the pyruvate into lactic acid
at the expense of NADH, removing the byproduct from the
reaction environment.
[1]
To recycle the cofactor (NADH), a third
enzyme (glucose dehydrogenase) was added. The formed
byproduct, however, caused a pH shift that affected the
transaminase stability.
[4]
Similar approaches employed a pyru-
vate decarboxylase to remove pyruvate by converting it to
acetaldehyde, but this molecule competes with the substrate to
be aminated, leading to ethylamine as side product.
[1,4]
Alternatively, another strategy based on an alanine dehy-
drogenase (AlaDH) has been applied to remove the pyruvate
from the reaction bulk by regenerating alanine in situ (with the
addition of NADH and NH
3
) so that the amine donor is
continuously available for the transaminase reaction.
[12–15]
There-
fore, both equilibrium displacement and byproduct inhibition
were addressed. The cofactor was then recycled by adding a
third enzyme, formate dehydrogenase (FDH).
[12,13]
Despite the advantages offered by multi-enzyme systems,
the production and optimization of each individual enzyme is
costly and time-consuming. Fusion proteins can address these
difficulties by combining enzymes that are catalytically compat-
ible into one single multifunctional enzyme,
[16,17]
and the
genetic fusion can result into improved catalytic efficiency due
to the closer proximity of the active sites.
[18,19]
Additionally, gene
expression, folding, and enzyme stability can be potentially
enhanced, but the design of the fusion enzyme must be
carefully rationalized.
[16]
In this work, we develop an easy-to-produce and efficient
enzymatic system that can be coupled to transaminase
reactions as the amino donor regeneration system. A bifunc-
tional enzyme has been rationally designed by combining an
alanine dehydrogenase from Halomonas elongata (HeAlaDH)
with a formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii
(CbFDH).

and studied. The efficiency of the bifunctional enzyme as amino
donor regenerator was then tested in biotransformations for
the amination of vanillin as a case of study. Two different ω-
transaminases, one from Halomonas elongata (HeWT)
[21]
and
one from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvTA)
[22]
were examined
in combination with the bifunctional enzyme (Scheme 1).
Results and Discussion
Design and development of genetic constructions
The genetic construction of both recombinant proteins was
developed using the original plasmid encoding the FDH
(pET28b-CbFDH) as the backbone template (Figure S1).
[19]
The
HeAlaDH gene was firstly inserted downstream of the FDH gene
sequence (His-FDH-AlaDH) (Figure 1 and Table S1) with the
inclusion of a flexible GSGGGGSAS linker between the two
domains to facilitate folding. Indeed, the presence of glycine
and serine as small polar amino acids has been shown to
provide good flexibility and optimal stability in water.
[23]
A
(6x)His-tag was also fused to the FDH domain for purification
purposes as in a previous fusion protein including the
CbFDH.
[19]
As both enzymes are multimeric proteins (CbFDH is dimeric
and HeAlaDH is hexameric), the assembly of the monomers can
vary within the fusion protein, and this may affect the final
enzymatic activity. Hence, a second genetic construct where
the gene of HeAlaDH was inserted upstream of the CbFDH
gene (AlaDH-FDH-His) was then developed (Figure 1). Indeed,
past works on fusion proteins showed that the orientation of
the domains can drastically change the activity as well as
stability of the final protein.
[24–27]
For instance, the fusion of an
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with a cyclohexanone monoox-
ygenase (CHMO) was studied and one orientation showed the
expected catalytic efficiency, while the other one showed low
to no activity at all.
[24]
In a another recent example, different
genetic constructs of CbFDH fused to an azoreductase were
analyzed, finding one conformation with a 20-fold lower
activity.
[25]
Production and purification of the fusion proteins
While the His-FDH-AlaDH construct yielded an active and
soluble system after a first expression screening (Table S2 and
Figure S2), AlaDH-FDH-His protein required an extensive opti-
mization of the expression conditions to obtain the enzyme in a
soluble form (Figure S3).
In a previous work, the fusion of a tetrameric levodione
reductase (LR) with a dimeric ATA linked by a PAS spacer
produced insoluble aggregates with a 4-amino acid linker, only
0.2 mg/L with a spacer of 20 residues, and 0.6 mg/L with 40 or
60 amino acids.
[28]
Hence, the proportion of soluble fusion
protein was significantly increased with the linker length, due
to the sufficient steric flexibility for efficient oligomerization of
each enzyme moiety with its characteristic quaternary structure.
Therefore, a higher spacer length could prevent protein
aggregation into inclusion bodies.
[28]
In the present case, the
distance between the different terminals might be shorter for
the second fusion protein (AlaDH-FDH-His), preventing the
correct folding of the two domains for insufficient space and
flexibility in between.
Activity and assembly of the fusion proteins
The specific activity was determined for both catalytic domains
(AlaDH and FDH), which was compared to the activity of the WT
enzymes (Table 1). For the His-FDH-AlaDH construct, only
11–12 % of the activity was retained with respect to the WT
AlaDH. On the other hand, 23 % of the activity of the FDH
domain was retained compared to the WT protein, 2-fold higher
than the activity of the AlaDH domain. This behavior may be
due to a different ratio of correct folding between the protein
domains. Indeed, FDH is active as a dimer, while AlaDH requires
six assembled monomers to be active. Therefore, it can be
expected that due to the higher structural complexity of AlaDH,
the activity compared to the parental enzymes is lower than for
the FDH. Yet, the AlaDH domain retained activity in the
chimeric construct while many previous attempts to develop
fusion proteins of, in principle, less complex protein structures,

failed in retaining the structure, and thus the activity, of the WT
enzymes.
[29,30]
In order to analyze the assembly of the monomers, size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the fusion protein was
performed. The results of the SEC confirmed that AlaDH and
FDH domains were not fully assembled in hexamers and dimers,
respectively (Figures S6 and S8). Instead, the two main con-
formations were assembled in 8 and 12 subunits for the His-
FDH-AlaDH. This may have led to the low retained specific
activity compared to the WT enzymes.
The second bifunctional enzyme (AlaDH-FDH-His) showed
higher retained activity than the first one (His-FDH-AlaDH)
(Table 1). Around 60 % of FDH activity was retained after the
fusion to the AlaDH, while the AlaDH domain retained 20–30 %
of the original activity, considering both directions of reaction
(amination and deamination). Overall, this fusion protein
presented 2/2.5-fold higher activity than the His-FDH-AlaDH
fusion protein for both protein domains. Notably, the percent-
age of activity of the FDH domain was twice that of the AlaDH
domain also in this case. This could be beneficial to ensure a
fast recycling of NADH without limiting the overall conversion.
Due to the higher enzymatic activity, AlaDH-FDH-His
enzyme was chosen for further characterization. In this case,
SEC revealed that AlaDH-FDH-His was mainly assembled in 12,
6, 2 and 1 subunits (Figures S7 and S9). This construct provided
at least part of the hexameric structure that is required for the
full activity. However, the presence of the other three quater-
nary structures reduced the overall retained activity.
Characterization of the AlaDH-FDH-His fusion protein
The affinity of the enzyme domains for the natural substrates
was assessed as shown in Table 2. The resulting K
M
values were
comparable between fusion protein and WT domains with most
of the substrates (while K
cat
was more heavily impacted). Only
NADH for the AlaDH domain and NAD
+
for the FDH domain
showed a 3.5-fold higher K
M
than the WT enzymes. A similar
behavior was found in other fusion proteins. The GluDH domain
in the GluDH-FDH protein presented a K
M
2-fold higher than the
parental enzymes.
[19]
Similarly, the PheDH-FDH-His fusion
protein had 2-fold higher K
M
values for the substrates phenyl-
pyruvate and formate than the WT enzymes.
[31]
In another
examples, the K
M
values of the FDH domain in the His-FDH-
AzoRo fusion protein increased by at least 10-fold for formate
and almost 2-fold for NAD
+
.
[25]
The stability of the fusion protein over different pH, temper-
ature, and cosolvent (DMSO) concentration was then inves-
tigated. For the AlaDH domain, the profile of pH stability
matches the WT enzyme (Figure S10).
[12]
The FDH domain did
not seem to lose activity after incubation at very low pH, even if
the AlaDH stability was considerably affected in the same
conditions. Concerning the temperature stability, the FDH
domain showed reduced stability at higher temperatures over
the 24 and 48 hours compared to the WT FDH, while no
difference was noticed between 25 ° C and 34 ° C (Figure S11). In
contrast, the AlaDH domain exhibited a profile comparable to
the WT AlaDH, without any significant loss of stability. As DMSO
was previously used to solubilize the substrate in the further
transamination reactions due to the good stability of HeWT,
[21]
the stability of AlaDH, FDH as well as AlaDH-FDH-His in the
presence of this solvent was assessed. At 10–20 % DMSO, the
AlaDH domain completely preserved the activity (Figure S12). In
the case of the FDH domain, most of the activity was retained
at 10 % DMSO, but 30 % activity loss was noted after long
incubation times (72 h) in presence of 20 % DMSO.
The results confirmed that both AlaDH and FDH domains
retained their overall properties when combined into a fusion
protein. Besides, it should be noted that both fusion partners
show biochemical compatibility at the reaction conditions that
would be required for the biotransformations of vanillin (pH 8.0,
37 ° C, and 10 % DMSO).
Batch biotransformations for the amination of vanillin
Transaminases are employed as biocatalysts for the synthesis of
flavors and fragrances.

transaminase HeWT for the model amination of vanillin to yield
vanillyl amine in batch biotransformations. The equilibrium of
this reaction is indeed unfavorable, requiring an excess of the
amino donor equivalents to shifts it towards the product.
[12,21]
Hence, this aromatic aldehyde is a very suitable substrate to
test our system. The fusion protein AlaDH-FDH-His was coupled
as a bifunctional biocatalyst to recycle the amino donor. To this
end, no excess of amino donor was employed, only 1 equivalent
of L-alanine. In parallel, the same reaction was performed with
the WT enzymes, adding a protein concentration comparable to
the corresponding protein domain of the fusion protein.
After 1 hour of reaction, HeWT coupled with the WT
enzymes (AlaDH and FDH) achieved 94 % of conversion, while
the coupling with the fusion protein reached only 66 %
conversion (Figure S13). Both enzymatic systems reached the
maximum conversion after 8 h. Despite the lower catalytic rate
of the fusion protein, these results confirmed the feasibility of
this system to recycle the amino donor (L-alanine) by removing
the by-product (pyruvate). Considering the lower activity of the
fusion protein domains compared to the WT enzymes and to
make a more comparable evaluation, biotransformations con-
taining the same activity (units) of fusion protein and WT
enzymes were carried out. In this case, both enzyme prepara-
tions performed similarly (Figure 2). In comparison, the reaction
using only HeWT, with no recycling system, stopped at 20 %
conversion after 24 h. AlaDH-FDH-His fusion protein in dialysis assisted
biotransformation
A dialysis-assisted set up has been employed to test the
scalability and the reusability of the fusion protein coupled to
transamination reactions.
[12]
The soluble AlaDH-FDH-His and
HeWT were contained in a dialysis membrane bag which was
then submerged in the reaction mixture (Figure S14A). Under
these conditions, full conversion of vanillin (10 mM, 5 mL) was
achieved in 24 hours (Figure S14B). To test the versatility of
AlaDH-FDH-His as amino donor recycling system, the fusion
protein was also combined with another S-selective trans-
aminase, CvTA, for the amination of vanillin. Full conversion
was also achieved in this case in 24 h (Figure 3).
Then, the reusability of the fusion protein was tested with
both HeWT and CvTA. In both cases, the enzymatic preparation
could be reused for at least 3 cycles in batch maintaining at
least 50 % of molar conversion after the third cycle (Figure 3).
Although the reaction conditions differ, the fusion protein
reported herein shows a similar reusability compared to our
previous work in which twice the amount of enzymes were
used for the amino donor regeneration (1.5 mg in this work,
3 mg in Ref. [12]).
Conclusion
After rational optimization of the expression conditions, two
bifunctional fusion proteins of AlaDH and FDH were produced
(His-FDH-AlaDH and AlaDH-FDH-His) to recycle alanine in
combination with enzymatic transaminations. The two enzymes
were active, although AlaDH-FDH-His fusion protein demon-

strated 2–2.5-fold higher activity compared to the His-FDH-
AlaDH assembly. In this regard, SEC indicated that the lower
activity was related to the different quaternary assembly of the
subunits compared to the original enzymes. AlaDH-FDH-His was
characterized, confirming similar stability and affinity compared
to the WT HeAlaDH and CbFDH. Moreover, the efficiency of the
fusion protein was proved in combination with two trans-
aminases (HeWT and CvTA) for the amination of vanillin,
showing similar conversion rates to the WT enzymes. Finally,
the enzymatic preparations could be reused as a dialysis-
assisted bioreactors. In summary, this work supports the use of
fusion proteins as a simpler and more cost-efficient strategy to
produce multi-functional biocatalysts although further optimi-
zations could increase the enzyme activity.
Experimental Section
Materials
Chemicals, reagents, and medium component, unless stated
otherwise, were obtained as analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich
and Fisher Scientific. All the materials and kits employed for the
cloning were acquired from New England Biolabs (NEB). Primers
were synthetized by Microsynth AG; NADH and NAD
+
were
purchased from Apollo Scientific Ltd.
Genetic construction
The genes of CbFDH and HeAlaDH were previously cloned from the
respective genomes.
[12,34]
Herein, both genes were inserted in the
pET28b(+) vector. A linker of Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Ala-Ser
was included between the two domains. Four restriction sites were
added as reported for a previous fusion protein construction.
[19]
The
plasmid of the CbFDH (UniProt ID: O13437) was used as template
for PCR amplification (vector fragments). For the development of
the AlaDH-FDH-His construct, the vector FDH-pET28b was firstly
mutated in a single position (6242 bp) where the stop codon was
located. To encode for the His-tag at the FDH C-terminal of AlaDH-
FDH-His fusion protein, a one-point mutation was performed to
remove the stop codon at the end of the FDH gene. The vector
FDH-pET28b was mutated in a single position (6242 bp). The
mutation resulted in the exchange of the base A contained in the
TAA stop codon for a C base, developing a TCA triplet, which
translates for a serine in the amino acidic structure. For the
purpose, a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit was employed
following the protocol given by the supplier.
The alanine dehydrogenase gene (UniProt ID: E1 V931) was
amplified from pRSETb-HeAlaDH to obtain the insert fragments. All
the designed primers are listed in Table S1. The genes were
amplified by PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase and the
obtained fragments (insert and vector) were used for cloning the
fusion construct with the Gibson Assembly Cloning kit. A previous
step of DpnI digestion with further heat-inactivation as well as
sample refinement with the PCR purification kit were done before
the assembly of the HeAlaDH with the vector containing the CbFDH
sequence. After completing the Gibson Assembly of His-FDH-AlaDH
gene, the assembled product was transformed into DH5α E. coli
comptetent cells, and the grown colonies were subjected to colony
PCR. The amplification was done using the T7 promoter as forward
primer and T7 terminator as reverse primer. All the amplified
fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis and the colony related
to the sample showing a 2.5 Kb size was chosen for plasmid
propagation, sequencing, and further studies. Regarding the
AlaDH-FDH-His, one colony was taken after transformation of the
assembled product into E. coli DH5α (included in the kit, protocol
given by the supplier), which was directly used for plasmid
replication, isolation, and sequencing.
Gene expression and protein purification
HeWT, HeAlaDH and CbFDH were produced as previously
described.
[12]
The plasmid pET28b harboring the gene of the fusion
protein was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells by
heat-shock at 42 ° C for 45 s, followed by 2 min on ice. After adding
0.5 mL of LB media and incubation at 37 ° C for 1 h, the cells were
plated on LB agar with the 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. Then, 1 L flasks
containing 300 mL of LB media supplemented with 50 μg/mL of
kanamycin were inoculated with 3 mL of an overnight culture and
incubated at 37 ° C (150 rpm) until the optical density (OD
600
) was
0.5–0.6. To induce the gene expression of His-FDH-AlaDH, 0.1 mM
IPTG was added after 30 minutes of cold shock (incubation on ice
for 30 min). Afterwards, flasks were left at 20 ° C overnight. Instead,
the overexpression to produce the recombinant fusion protein
AlaDH-FDH-His was induced by the addition of 0.1 μM IPTG and the
culture was grown at 16 ° C for an overnight. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 4,500 rpm (20 min, 4 ° C) and resuspended in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl and 30 mM
imidazole at pH 7.5. The suspension was placed on ice and
sonicated at 40 % amplitude for 8 min, with pulses of 5 s ON, 10 s
OFF using the sonicator Fisherbrand
TM
Model 120 Sonic Dismem-
brator. After centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 45 min, the super-
natant was filtered (0.45 μm pore size) and the fusion proteins were
purified from the supernatant by a Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare)
in the ÄKTA Pure system. The proteins were eluted in 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole
at pH 7.5. The purified enzymes were dialyzed twice in 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. The protein concentration
was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in the
EPOCH2 spectrophotometer (nanodrop Tek3 plate), using the
predicted molar extinction coefficients (ɛ) and molecular weights:

and 82 KDa for the AlaDH and
FDH fusion proteins. The ɛ values were obtained from https://
web.expasy.org/protparam. The purity of the purified proteins was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Size exclusion chromatography
The previously reported protocol was followed.
[19]
Briefly, the
purified fusion protein was applied to a gel filtration column
(Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated
with buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and mounted
onto an ÄKTA Pure instrument (GE Healthcare). The flow rate was
set at 0.5 mL/min. A calibration curve was made by plotting the
elution volumes of the protein standards (Carbonic anhydrase from
bovine erythrocytes (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa),
alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast (150 kDa), β-amylase from sweet
potato (200 kDa), apoferritin from horse spleen (443 kDa), bovine
thyroglobulin (669 kDa), blue dextran (2,000 kDa)). The elution of
the standard proteins and the sample was followed by absorbance
readings at 280 nm. The molecular weight of the fusion protein was
calculated through the elution volume fitted in the equation
obtained from the calibration curve.

Activity assays
HeWT and CvTA: enzymatic activity was determined as described
elsewhere.
[21]
Briefly, 2.5 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM S-MBA (S-(  )-α-
Methylbenzylamine), and 0.1 mM PLP in phosphate buffer at pH 8.0
was added to the enzyme solution. The formation of acetophenone
was following at 245 nm (ɛ: 12,000 M

) for 2 minutes. One
unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to
produce 1 μmol of acetophenone per minute at 30 ° C.
AlaDH and FDH: One unit of activity was determined as the
amount of enzyme needed to produce or consume 1 μmol of
NADH per minute at 25 ° C. The activity assay was performed in a
96-well plate and detected by UV absorbance at 340 nm
(ɛ: 6,220 M

  1
). Each protein domain was evaluated singularly
(AlaDH oxidative deamination: 40 mM L-alanine in 100 mM NaHCO
3
pH 10; 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 250 mM ammonium chloride
in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer 50 mM pH 8.0 for AlaDH
reductive amination; FDH: 100 mM sodium formate in potassium
phosphate 25 mM pH 7.5). The appropriate cofactor was added in
the reaction mixture (0.3 mM of NADH for AlaDH reductive
amination, 1 mM of NAD
+
for AlaDH oxidative deamination, 3 mM
of NAD
+
for FDH activity, as final concentrations). The specific
activity was calculated in U/mg considering the overall concen-
tration of the fusion protein. See more details on the calculation of
the normalized activity (U/mg) in section 4 of the supporting
information.
Kinetic parameters
The kinetics of the AlaDH (WT and AlaDH-FDH-His) in the
deamination direction were determined by measuring the activity
of the enzyme when either the concentration of alanine or NAD
+
was varied. The concentration ranges used were as follows: 0.5–
60 mM alanine and 0.1–5 mM NAD
+
. In the aminating reacting, the
kinetic parameters of pyruvate (0.05–5 mM), NADH (0.01–0.5 mM)
and ammonia (10–50 mM) were determined. For the FDH (WT and
AlaDH-FDH-His), the kinetic parameters of NAD
+
(0.1–3 mM) and
formate (2–135 mM; with 3 mM NAD
+
). The activity of the enzyme
was measured as described in the previous section unless otherwise
specified. All assays were carried out at least in duplicate. The data
was fitted to Michaelis-Menten plots in GraphPad Prism 7 which
was also used to calculate the kinetic parameters. For Kcat
calculations, the following data were employed: V
max
(U/mg) shown
in Table 1, Mw (g/mol) and protein in reaction (mg) of only one
domain (AlaDH or FDH) in case of the fusion protein.
Affinity assays
The kinetic constants were found in triplicate by measuring the
dependence of initial rate on substrate concentration at 25 ° C in
the same buffers mentioned before. For oxidative deamination
reaction of AlaDH, L-alanine concentration was varied from 0.1 to
60 mM in the presence of 1 mM NAD
+
, while the cofactor
concentration ranged from 0.1 to 3.0 mM (40 mM L-alanine). For
the reverse reaction, pyruvate concentration was varied from 0.1 to
4 mM at a fixed concentration of 250 mM ammonium chloride;
ammonium chloride was ranged between 10 to 500 mM at 2.5 mM
sodium pyruvate. In both cases, the concentration of NADH was
0.5 mM. The kinetic constants for formic acid in the reaction of FDH
were found by using a range between 2–135 mM sodium formate
concentration at 3 mM NAD
+
. The cofactor affinity was also
evaluated by changing the concentration of NADH from 0.03 to
0.5 mM (2.5 mM pyruvate, 250 mM ammonium chloride) and 0.1–
3.0 mM for NAD
+
(40 mM L-alanine for AlaDH and 100 mM formate
for FDH). Reactions were made by adding an appropriate amount
of enzyme in 10 μL solution, and the 20-fold concentrated cofactor
solution (10 μL volume) in the 96 well-plates. The measurement
started after mixing the substrates (180 μL) and following the
change in absorbance at 340 nm at 25 ° C.
Stability assays
The stability measurements at different temperatures, DMSO
concentrations, and pH were executed in triplicate by incubating
the biocatalyst solution at different temperatures (pH 7.5) or at pH
values from 3 to 10 (temperature 4 ° C) and withdrawing samples at
regular times (2, 24, 48 hours) for proceeding with specific activity
assays of the fusion protein in parallel with the WT enzymes.
Batch biotransformations
Reactions were performed with appropriate enzymes concentration,
and the desired substrates. Dialysis assisted reactions were done as
previously published.
[12]
Briefly, 10 mM vanillin, 10 mM L-alanine,
100 mM ammonium formate, 1 mM NAD
+
, 0.1 mM PLP, 100 mM
phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 10 % DMSO were added together with a
proper amount of enzymes.
At different times, a volume of 50 μL was quenched with 225 μL
HCl 0.2 % and 225 μL of acetonitrile. These samples were then
analyzed by HPLC (Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC Thermo Fisher
Scientific), implemented with a C18 column (Waters X-Bridge,
3.5 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm). The flow rate was left at 0.8 mL/min and the
oven was set at 45 ° C. The samples were run using a gradient
method from 5 : 95 to 95 : 5 (MilliQ water and acetonitrile with 0.1 %
TFA) over 4 minutes. Conversions were calculated using A calibra-
tion curve of vanillin (5.2 min retention time) and vanillyl amine
(4.05 min).
Dialysis assisted biotransformations
A mix of enzymes at the desired concentration were added inside a
dialysis cellulose membrane tubing with a cut-off (MWCO) of
14 KDa (D9527-100FT from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The
membrane secured in both sides and submerged into a glass vial
with total volume of 5 mL. The glass vials were covered with tape
to avoid loss of solution by evaporation and hold in a water bath
via a polystyrene sheet, ensuring that all the reaction solution is
inside the water. Reactions were left stirring (250 rpm) at 37 ° C. As a
negative control, a vial containing all the substrates but the
enzymes (replaced with buffer solution) was also employed. At the
desired timepoints, samples were taken from the reaction bulk and
analyzed by HPLC.
