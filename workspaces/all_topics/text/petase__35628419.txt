Abstract: The global utilization of single-use, non-biodegradable plastics, such as bottles made of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), has contributed to catastrophic levels of plastic pollution. Fortu-
nately, microbial communities are adapting to assimilate plastic waste. Previously, our work showed
a full consortium of ﬁve bacteria capable of synergistically degrading PET. Using omics approaches,
we identiﬁed the key genes implicated in PET degradation within the consortium’s pangenome
and transcriptome. This analysis led to the discovery of a novel PETase, EstB, which has been
observed to hydrolyze the oligomer BHET and the polymer PET. Besides the genes implicated in PET
degradation, many other biodegradation genes were discovered. Over 200 plastic and plasticizer
degradation-related genes were discovered through the Plastic Microbial Biodegradation Database
(PMBD). Diverse carbon source utilization was observed by a microbial community-based assay,
which, paired with an abundant number of plastic- and plasticizer-degrading enzymes, indicates
a promising possibility for mixed plastic degradation. Using RNAseq differential analysis, several
genes were predicted to be involved in PET degradation, including aldehyde dehydrogenases and
several classes of hydrolases. Active transcription of PET monomer metabolism was also observed,
including the generation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)/polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymers.
These results present an exciting opportunity for the bio-recycling of mixed plastic waste with
upcycling potential.

1. Introduction
Currently, it is estimated that nearly 80% of all plastic ever made will be discarded into
landﬁlls or as pollution within our ecosystems, and this percentage is rapidly increasing [1].
Globally, over 380 million metric tons of plastic are produced each year, and 10 million
metric tons end up in our oceans annually [ 2]. Fifty percent of this material is made
for single-use purposes, and the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately created an even greater
demand for single-use plastics, which only exacerbated the plastic pollution crisis [ 3,4].
Continuing at this pace, it is estimated that by 2050, by weight, there will be more plastics
in our oceans than ﬁsh [5]. The widespread pollution caused by plastics and microplastics
is ubiquitous [1]. They have been found within humans [6] and many other organisms [7],
in virtually all the environmental locations that have been tested [8–10], and even dispersed
in rainwater [11].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene (PE), polyamide
(PA), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polypropylene (PP) comprise the

majority of manufactured plastics [12]. Fortunately, within the microbial world, enzymes
exist to degrade naturally occurring compounds, such as lignin, that are chemically similar
to synthetic polymers [13,14], and the microbes encoding these enzymes are found in both
marine and terrestrial environments [15]. Of these polymers, there has been a concerted
effort to identify PETases to degrade recycled water bottles and other single-use containers,
improve their activity through the modiﬁcation of active sites, and improve thermal sta-
bility. In 2016, from a plastics recycling facility in Japan, Yoshida et al. isolated Ideonella
sakaiensis that encoded a PETase and a second enzyme, MHETase, involved in the stepwise
degradation of PET [16]. I. sakaiensis was determined to exist as part of a consortium of
microbes and was able to use PET as a sole source of carbon and energy [ 17]. Taking a
metagenomics approach, researchers who were studying leaf compost identiﬁed a cutinase
(LCC) that was also able to degrade PET [18].
Further research shows the beneﬁts of using microbial consortia for bioremediation
due to their mixed metabolism within native bacterial communities [ 19]. Consortia of
environmental microbiomes have been documented to enzymatically and synergistically
degrade petroleum and petroleum-derived products such as plastics [20–26]. Previously,
we isolated a microbial consortium from petroleum-contaminated soils comprised of ﬁve
Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp. that showed the synergistic degradation of PET [25]. Sequenc-
ing revealed that these strains had unique and diverse genomes with many enzymes with
hydrolytic activities [27]. However, the genetics behind the mixed metabolism and observed
synergy amongst these strains had not been fully realized. By employing pangenomic
analysis, our goal was to identify the core gene clusters responsible for PET degradation,
as well as other plastic-degrading genes and pathways from our previously described
consortia of bacteria [25].
A pangenome is the collective set of genes shared by all strains of a species [ 28]. It
contains a core genome with all the genes shared by the same species, such as essential
metabolic genes and regulatory functions, and a variable genome. The variable genome
within a pangenome are those genes that are present in two or more strains; they are often
genes from speciﬁc adaptations within their environment and are not found within the
core genome [29,30]. By using reference genomes of closely related species that were not
identiﬁed to degrade PET, the gene clusters shared amongst the consortia members were
analyzed to give insight into their adaptive evolution toward plastic degradation [31,32].
Additionally, studying transcriptomics of consortia can be a powerful tool to identify
the active RNA transcripts under restrictive conditions, such as growth on a single carbon
source like PET [33–35]. Our results identify the genetic pathways within the Pseudomonas
and Bacillus spp. that, in part, explain the synergistic degradation of PET. These data
regarding bacteria residing in petroleum-polluted soils revealed a wealth of enzymes that
are predicted [36] to be associated with the biodegradation of multiple types of biological
and synthetic plastic polymers.
2. Results
2.1. Employing Pangenomic Analysis toward Understanding Synergistic PET Degradation
Previously, our group provided experimental evidence that a full consortium of three
Pseudomonas and two Bacillus spp. collected from hydrocarbon-polluted soil could synergis-
tically degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [25]. Due to this observed synergy, we
sought to examine the pangenome encoded by the full consortium to gain deeper insight
into how they might be degrading PET genetically and metabolically.
In this analysis, the 232 core genomes (i.e., all Pseudomonas (144) and Bacillus (88)
species within the MicroScope platform database [37] (excluding the ﬁve strains within our
full consortium) at the time of this analysis) were purposefully excluded (Supplemental
Figure S1). The parameters were set using 50% amino acid (aa) identity and 80% alignment
coverage. After the exclusion of the core genome found in all Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp.
within the database, 259 gene groups were found to be shared in the core genome within
the pangenome of these ﬁve strains (Figure 1).

coverage. After the exclusion of the core genome found in all Pseudomonas and Bacillus 
spp. within the database, 259 gene groups we re found to be shared in the core genome 
within the pangenome of these five strains (Figure 1).

Bacillus albus PFN01 strain 13.1 and Pseudomonas sp. B10 strain 9.2 had the most di-
verse set of accessory genes (Supplemental File S1) compared to all other strains within 
the full consortium indicating clear di fferences between the consortia members. Bacillus 
strains 9.1 and 13.1 share a large pangenome of over 3305 genes. The pangenome of all 
three Pseudomonas strains contained over 2292 shared genes. When comparing Pseudomo-
nas strain 10 and 13.2, it was established that strain 10 contained 70 unique, species-spe-
cific hypothetical proteins different from th e pangenome, while 13.2 contained 58 differ-
ent genes, despite species relation. 
Initially, within the core pangenome, several gene groups were of interest, including 
aldehyde dehydrogenases, esterases, and alcohol dehydrogenases (Supplemental File 2). 
Prior to RNA sequencing and database analysis, these genes were predicted to be involved 
in PET degradation, as dehydrogenases and esterases have been implicated in PET oligo-
mer and monomer degradation, but the specific enzymes responsible had yet to be con-
firmed.

2.2. Esterase EstB in Strain 9.2 Is Active against PET
An esterase encoded in the estB gene identiﬁed within the pangenome was discovered
and explored. Previously, researchers discovered that anestB encoded in Enterobacter sp.
HY1 could degrade BHET [39]. With this in mind, a deletion mutant of esterase gene estB
(∆estB) in strain Pseudomonas 9.2 was created using pEX18Tc sacB suicide plasmid to test
if it could cleave BHET [40]. This ∆estB mutant showed signiﬁcantly decreased esterase

activity on 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-np-butyrate) (Figure 2a). To conﬁrm p-np-butyrate
activity, the puriﬁed EstB protein resulted in increased p-np-butyrate cleavage, illustrated
in Figure 2b.

estB (ΔestB) in strain Pseudomonas 9.2 was created using pEX18Tc sacB suicide plasmid to 
test if it could cleave BHET [40]. This ΔestB mutant showed significantly decreased ester-
ase activity on 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-np-butyrate) (Figure 2a). To confirm p-np-butyr-
ate activity, the purified EstB protein resulted  in increased p-np-butyrate cleavage, illus-
trated in Figure 2b.

(p < 0.0001). All samples were conducted in triplicate and averaged, there was no signiﬁcant differ-
ence between replicates.
The incubation of EstB on BHET results in a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in BHET
peak area (p < 0.0001), coupled with a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the MHET peak
area (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3b). There was also a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the TPA
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 5 of 22
peak area (p < 0.0001), although this is likely a result of the spontaneous hydrolysis of
MHET. This is because EstB largely shows no activity against MHET, and the hydrolytic
cleavage of BHET would only yield MHET and EG, not TPA. All three monomers are
present in the micro-PET solution prior to the addition of EstB, which is likely a result of
hydrolysis from the micro-PET production procedure in which TFA was used to dissolve
the PET plastic.
The addition of EstB to the micro-PET solution results in a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in both the MHET and the TPA peak areas (p < 0.0001), but no change in the BHET
peak area. The absence of an increase in the BHET peak area indicates that any BHET freed
from PET cleavage is subsequently hydrolyzed to MHET. TPA is expected to be released
from the hydrolysis of PET due to different oligomer and monomer products being released,
depending on which ester bonds are cleaved (Supplemental Figure S2). While EG is not
detected via HPLC spectra at 254 nm, it is assumed to be in the solution, as the cleavage of
BHET to MHET releases EG.
In order to conduct preliminary structure analyses of EstB, its 3D structure was
predicted with a computational AI system called AlphaFold v2.0 [41]. AlphaFold predicts
the 3D structure of a protein from just its amino acid sequence by incorporating novel neural
network architectures and training procedures based on homology to solve structural,
evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints [41]. The structure of EstB belongs to the
α/β hydrolase superfamily and contains the conserved serine hydrolase Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly
(Gly112- Phe113-Ser114-Gln115-Gly116) located at the active site [ 42], with the residues
Asp168 and His199 completing the catalytic triad.
As EstB shares the same activity on PET and BHET as the PETase ofIdeonella sakaien-
sis [43], degrading PET and BHET to form MHET, the two enzymes were subsequently
compared on a structural level. The IsPETase has an L-shaped hydrophobic binding cleft
that binds the PET polymer, with hydrolytic cleavage occurring at the catalytic serine
residue. The dimensions of this cleft are roughly 40 Å in length and 29 Å in width. A
similar hydrophobic cleft was identiﬁed in EstB, extending from the catalytic triad. The di-
mensions of this cleft are approximately 33 Å in length and 30 Å in width (Figure 4). Based
on the mutational analysis, the assays using a puriﬁed protein, and the initial structural
analysis, we concluded that EstB of Pseudomonas strain 9.2 is indeed a PETase.

2.3. Identification of Predicted Plastic Degrading Genes Using PMBD 
The annotated amino acid FASTA file generated above from pangenomic analysis 
was used to mine for genes with plastic-degrading potential using the Plastic Metabolic 
Biodegradation Database (PMBD) [36]. Within the pangenome, 250 genes were predicted 
to be involved with plastic degradation (Supplemental File S2). These genes consisted 
mostly of hydrolases and oxidoreductases of  various enzyme classes (Supplemental File 
S3), but also included regulatory proteins , essential transferases, lyases, and isomer-
ases/translocases crucial to downstream monomer assimilation. 
2.4. Genes Implicated in PET Degradation 
The oligomers BHET/MHET and the polymer PET have been previously identified 
to be hydrolyzed via esterase/hydrolase activity. Two predicted PET hydrolases encoded 
in Streptomyces sp. shared more than 23% identity to alpha/beta hydrolases/dienelactone 
hydrolase encoded in Bacillus strain 9.1 and in Pseudomonas strains 10/13.2. Additionally, 
three enzymes within four of the five strains, the exception being strain Bacillus 13.1, were 
predicted to have feruloyl esterase activity ; these enzymes were annotated as cellulose-
binding proteins, with two being feruloyl esterases, according to UniProt (Table 1). The 
esterase EstB was one of three enzymes identified as having feruloyl esterase activity. 
Monomers of PET, terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG) were previously 
identified as being assimilated by the full consortium [25]. Analysis shows (Table 1) that 
the Pseudomonas spp . strains encoded dioxygenases/red uctase complexes with greater 
than 34% identity to previously identified TPA dioxygenases in Comamonas sp. [33], as 
well as other dioxygenases complexes (Table 3) that may be responsible for TPA degrada-
tion. We predicted that aldehyde dehydrogenases and/or alcohol dehydrogenases en-
coded within the genomes of the full consortium would be involved in the biodegradation 
EG. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have been implicated in poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) and 
EG metabolism, as well as implicated in the surface modification of PET plastic [35,44,45] 
Identified from this analysis, an encoded aldehyde dehydrogenase had nearly 34% iden-
tity to petroleum-degrading Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. As these organisms were collected

Monomers of PET, terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG) were previously
identiﬁed as being assimilated by the full consortium [25]. Analysis shows (Table 1) that
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 7 of 22
the Pseudomonas spp. strains encoded dioxygenases/reductase complexes with greater
than 34% identity to previously identiﬁed TPA dioxygenases in Comamonas sp. [33], as well
as other dioxygenases complexes (Table 3) that may be responsible for TPA degradation.
We predicted that aldehyde dehydrogenases and/or alcohol dehydrogenases encoded
within the genomes of the full consortium would be involved in the biodegradation EG.
Aldehyde dehydrogenases have been implicated in poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) and EG
metabolism, as well as implicated in the surface modiﬁcation of PET plastic [ 35,44,45]
Identiﬁed from this analysis, an encoded aldehyde dehydrogenase had nearly 34% identity
to petroleum-degrading Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. As these organisms were collected from
oil-contaminated soils, we hypothesized that this or other aldehyde dehydrogenases may
be active against petroleum-derived carbon sources, such as PET.
2.5. Genes Implicated in the Biodegradation of Other Plastic Types
Despite investigating the pangenome for PET degradation initially, a multitude of
identiﬁed genes were implicated in the degradation of other plastic types. These types
included synthetic PUR and PVA, as well as more biodegradable polymers and biopolymers
such as PLA and PHA/PHB (Table 1). Research has shown that several Pseudomonas and
Bacillus species are highly proﬁcient at degrading most polymers and xenobiotics [46–49].
It is possible that several other plastic types might be degradable by our full consortium.
Other encoded oxidoreductases and hydrolases (Supplemental File S3) may degrade other
plastic types as well, and our group currently has studies underway to determine the full
consortium’s biodegradation potential.
2.6. Genes Implicated in the Biodegradation of Plasticizer and Xenobiotics
We observed a majority of biodegradation enzymes predominately being involved
in plasticizer degradation (Table 2). This is in accordance with previous research showing
that within the global microbiome, soil microbes, such as these strains, have a higher
diversity of plasticizer degradation when compared to marine environments [15]. Several
of these oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases were correlated with plasticizers such as
polyethylene glycol (PEG) [44] and polypropylene glycol (PPG) [45], as well as xenobiotics
such as PAHs and other phenols (Table 2) [50,51].

2.7. Strains within the Full Consortium Have Diverse Carbon Sources Utilization
A microbial community-based analysis was performed using Biolog EcoPlates ® to
assess the overall carbon utilization amongst the strains and the full consortium. Results
indicate a wide substrate capability (Figure 5) of the individual strains, which is also
evidenced by their pangenomes (Figure 1).
The non-aromatic amino acid L-asparagine was the preferred carbon source of most
strains, and as a result, this carbon source was chosen as a control for further transcrip-
tomic analysis of PET degradation. Of the most interest, as examined above, was the
paraben 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, which was within the top ten fastest utilized carbon
sources for the full consortium. This carbon source is proven to be transported into the
cell using PcaK [54,55] and is hypothesized to be a probable transporter for TPA in the
Pseudomonas species.

Figure 5. Comparison of relative carbon source utili zation between the indivi dual strains and the 
full consortium over 24-h using Biolog EcoPlates ®. Thirty-one carbon sources, in triplicate, were 
evaluated kinetically via a colorime tric assay over a 24-h period at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). 
Triplicate values were averaged to determine relative absorbance compared to the control samples 
(water). 
As expected, based on previous screenings [25] for lipase and esterase activity, Tween 
40 was a favorable carbon source amongst the strains. Overall, amino acids and other ni-
trogen-containing compounds tended to be a fa vorable carbon source for all strains, ex-
cluding Bacillus 9.1. Strain 9.1 was -growing under room temperature conditions and pref-
erentially grew on polysaccharides and monosaccharides, as well as the chitin monomer, 
N-acetyl-glucosamine, and non-ionic surfactant Tween 80. This slow growth may be tem-
perature-dependent, as Bacillus 9.1 grows rapidly at 40 °C. Putrescine was also preferred 
by the full consortium, which is of interest, as putrescine is an alkane. This provides fur-
ther evidence there that the full consortium  may possess alkane metabolism potentially 
involved in LDPE degradation [56,57]. 
In contrast to the observed synergy on PE T, the full consortium did not degrade as 
wide of a range of substrates as the individual strains (with the exception of Bacillus strain 
9.1, 77%) with a functional diversity score of 84% (see methods for diversity and similarity 
scoring); however, the full consortium did utilize preferred carbon sources more effi-
ciently than all other strains, reaching an average optical density greater than the individ-
ual strains in the same time period (Supplemental Table 1) despite the same inoculation 
concentration and conditions. Bacillus strain 13.1 and the full consortium were the most 
similar in carbon source utilization, with 90% similarity. Pseudomonas strain 10 had the 
most diverse carbon utilization of all, with a 97% functional diversity, able to utilize all 
but 2-hydroxy benzoic acid. Despite Pseudomonas 10 and 13.2 being the same species, they 
were only 90% similar in carbon source utiliz ation. This stark contrast in carbon source 
utilization and the differences within the pangenome (Figure 1) show incredible func-
tional genetic diversity. 
These differences might explain the observed  variations in growth and biofilm for-
mation (Figure 6). Using a crystal violet microtiter assay, differences in biofilm formation 
between individual strains and the full consortium were quantified. Pseudomonas strains

than all other strains, reaching an average optical density greater than the individual strains
in the same time period (Supplemental Table S1) despite the same inoculation concentration
and conditions. Bacillus strain 13.1 and the full consortium were the most similar in carbon

These differences might explain the observed variations in growth and bioﬁlm for-
mation (Figure 6). Using a crystal violet microtiter assay, differences in bioﬁlm formation
between individual strains and the full consortium were quantiﬁed. Pseudomonas strains
9.2 and 10 exhibited signiﬁcantly more bioﬁlm formation than strains 9.1, 13.1, 13.2, and

the full consortium. Of greatest interest was the difference in bioﬁlm production between
Pseudomonas strains 10 and 13.2, which are the same species. After 48 h of growth at 37 ◦C,
strain 10 exhibited a solubilized crystal violet optical density of 0.12 ±0.035, while the
optical density of strain 13.2 was only 0.03±0.015. This signiﬁcant difference could perhaps
be attributed to the two strains’ variation in carbon source utilization, their differences in
transcriptional activity, and their distinct species-speciﬁc pangenome encode proteins.

optical density of strain 13.2 was only 0.03 ± 0.015. This significant difference could per-
haps be attributed to the two strains’ variatio n in carbon source utilization, their differ-
ences in transcriptional activity, and their distinct species-specific pangenome encode pro-
teins.

2.8. Differential RNAseq Analysis Shows Diverse Transcriptional Activity Amongst the 
Individual Strains Related to PET Monomer Degradation and PHA Storage 
RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis provided insight into how the full consortium 
may be interacting and metabolizing PET and its monomers during the late exponential 
phase of growth. It appears the strains within the full consortium may be degrading PET 
in different ways, possibly explaining synergistic effects. Differential analysis obtained by 
using data from the full consortium grown on L-asparagine as a control compared to PET 
indicates a significant upregulation of genes related to initial PET degradation; the pre-
dicted monomer metabolism of both TPA and EG, as well as downstream PHA metabo-
lism, were also observed to be upregulated amongst the strains (Table 4). 
A previous transcriptomic analysis from Kumari et al. [35]. proposed that aldehyde 
dehydrogenases are active against PET in Bacillus, generating 4-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)car-
bonyl]benzoate resulting from the deprotonation of the free carboxy group of MHET. In 
this study, RNAseq analysis of the full consortium grown on PET has shown a significant 
upregulation of an aldehyde dehydrogenase in  strain 9.2. This aldehyde dehydrogenase 
might be acting on EG but may also act on PET itself. As EstB was also experimentally 
shown to hydrolyze PET to MHET, this further supports the work of Kumari et al., who 
proposed that aldehyde dehydrogenases and carboxylesterases play a role in PET hydrol-
ysis in some species [35]. 
Despite TPA degradation-related genes being absent in strain 9.1 [25] during previ-
ous genome exploration, based on differential analysis and annotation, strain 9.1 had

Despite TPA degradation-related genes being absent in strain 9.1 [25] during previous
genome exploration, based on differential analysis and annotation, strain 9.1 had signiﬁcant
upregulation of genes with signiﬁcant identity to phthalate dioxygenases and dehydro-
genase (Table 4), as well as a phenol hydrolase. A transporter with signiﬁcant identity to
a gentisate transporter (GenK) was also upregulated and is likely how TPA or oligomers

of PET may transverse the outer membrane of strain 9.1. Additionally, in 9.1, an alcohol
dehydrogenase and a glyoxal reductase were upregulated, likely illustrating its role in
ethylene glycol metabolism.

A differential analysis of RNAseq transcripts from strain 10 and 13.2 suggests TPA
was actively being degraded at the time of RNA extraction. Numerous dioxygenases and
decarboxylases with signiﬁcant identity to phthalate oxidoreductases, including Tereph-
thalate 1,2-dioxygenase, were present (Table 4). Additionally, evidence of downstream
beta-ketoadipate metabolism indicates that TPA is being further metabolized, likely toward
PHA/PHB synthesis.
The upregulation of related genes and PHA biosynthesis were present in all strain
transcripts (Table 4). Both Pseudomonas strains 10 and 13.2 had signiﬁcant transcriptional
upregulation of carboxylesterase NlhH, which was identiﬁed within the pangenome above
as likely a PHA/PHB depolymerase [ 58]. The deletion of nlhH in strain 9.2 showed
no reduction of np-butyrate hydrolysis (Supplemental Figure S3), indicating differences
in esterase activity compared to EstB and may or may not be directly involved in PET
polymer depolymerization.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 12 of 22
Interestingly, only strain 10 had an increased transcription level of surfactin (Table 4),
and 113 ‘hypothetical proteins’ were upregulated in strain 10, whereas only 77 were
upregulated in strain 13.2 (Supplemental File S4). These gene differences in strain 10 may
partially explain the differences in bioﬁlm production [59] (Figure 6).
3. Discussion
By using the pangenome of the full consortium containing three Pseudomonas and two
Bacillus strains, we were able to predict which enzymes were potential PET degradation
enzymes. From this analysis, many hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and dehydrogenases
were identiﬁed (Supplemental File S3). Previously, a group determined that a secreted
carboxylesterase 2, EstB encoded in Enterobacter sp. HY1, was able to degrade BHET, a
monomer of PET [39]. As our group identiﬁed an EstB within the pangenome, we hypoth-
esized this enzyme within the Pseudomonas strains might be a PET/BHET hydrolyzing
enzyme. After screening for p-np-butyrate esterase activity via the deletion and puriﬁcation
of EstB (Figure 2), as well as incubation on BHET and PET, our data indicated that EstB
hydrolyzed BHET to the oligomer MHET and the monomer TPA (Figure 3), similar to the
Ideonella sakaiensis PETase [16].
A comparison of the structure of IsPETase [60] to the predicted structure of EstB
revealed considerable structural similarity, including a similar binding cleft, catalytic triad,
and lack of a lid structure (Figure 4), indicating that EstB is a PETase. The observations
of similar active sites and enzymatic activities, combined with a relatively low primary
amino acid sequence identity between the IsPETase and EstB, is consistent with the idea of
the convergent evolution of bacteria in disparate locations to evolve the ability to degrade
PET and other plastics. EstB was predicted to have feruloyl esterase activity when aligned
with the PMBD (Table 1), and other enzymes that could potentially degrade PET were
also identiﬁed.
The predicted PETases included two dienelactone hydrolases encoded in bothPseu-
domonas strains 10 and 13.2 and in Bacillus strain 9.1. Further transcriptomic analysis
within the Pseudomonas strains indicated the upregulation of carboxylesterases NlhH in
strains 10 and 13.2 and an aldehyde dehydrogenase upregulated in 9.2 (Table 4) when the
strains were incubated on PET. Kumari et al. previously identiﬁed, through transcriptomic
analysis, the complex interactions of carboxylesterases and aldehyde dehydrogenases
on the degradation of PET, possibly through the generation of 4-[(2-hydroxyethoxy) car-
bonyl] [35]. This study gives further evidence of potential aldehyde dehydrogenase- and
carboxylesterase-mediated PET degradation.
While the Pseudomonas strains seemed to be actively metabolizing PET and TPA using
the presence of various oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases (Table 4),Bacillus strain 9.1
seems to play a key role in ethylene glycol metabolism. Strain 9.1 had a high upregula-
tion of an alcohol dehydrogenase and glyoxalase, which are two genes implicated in EG
metabolism. However, strain 9.1 also might be involved in BHET and TPA metabolism. The
upregulation of the aromatic transporters GenK in Bacillus strain 9.1 may be responsible
for PET monomer uptake, such as TPA. The downstream metabolism of TPA was ob-
served within the Pseudomonas species via the presence of genes involving Beta-ketoadipate,
butonate, and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) metabolism.
It is likely the consortia utilize stored biopolymers PHA/PHB as a supplementary
carbon source over time. After hydrolyzing the PET polymer and oligomers, PET monomers
are assimilated, and the consortia generate biopolymer PHA. Evidence of PHA synthesis
and depolymerization is shown in the upregulation of PHA/PHB depolymerases and
synthases (Table 4) when grown on PET. It is hypothesized that there is an inability to
cleave PET further after reaching the late exponential/stationary phase, either through the
buildup of toxic intermediaries or product inhibition. This storage of PHA/PHB provides
potential “upcycling” of PET waste as an alternative biodegradable plastic.
One important aspect of PET degradation is the ability of the bacteria to adhere to
the surface of the hydrophobic polymer. Bioﬁlms are crucial for PET degradation due to
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 13 of 22
increased adherence to the surface of PET, accompanied by increased hydrophilicity and
carbonyl index [61]. Bioﬁlm production was measured in all consortia members (Figure 6),
and the data indicated that Pseudomonas strain 10 possessed the greatest bioﬁlm potential,
compared to the other strains. Surfactin production directly results in increased bioﬁlm
formation [59], and we observed the presence of and signiﬁcant upregulation of surfactin
in strain 10, which is consistent with the increased bioﬁlm formation capabilities. This was
not observed in Pseudomonas strain 13.2 or the other consortium members.
The transcripts between all strains, particularly Pseudomonas 10 and 13.2, that were
grown on plastic varied dramatically. Interestingly, strain 10 contained 70 unique species-
speciﬁc hypothetical proteins different from the pangenome, while 13.2 contained 58, even
though they are genetically the same species. This might, in part, explain the observed
differences in growth and gene expression (Table 4) and bioﬁlm formation (Figure 6).
These data provide insight into how the consortia might be interacting when grown on the
surface of PET, showing different functional roles. Of note, Bacillus strain 13.1 had very few
transcripts, possibly indicating a temporal function in early phases of PET biodegradation
but not in later stages.
While able to degrade PET, this environmental consortium is also highly carbon
diverse; the strains are able to degrade a wide variety of carbon sources, illustrated by the
Biolog EcoPlate data (Figure 5) and the large number of predicted polymer biodegradation
genes (Tables 1 and 2). The full consortium appears to have a pangenome capable of
degrading a variety of plastic types, which would make mixed plastic recycling possible.
Polyurethane [24], LDPE [62,63] and PLA [64,65] degradation have been observed by both
Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp. previously. PVA, a water-soluble plastic that is typically used
in dish and laundry detergent “pods” and has been entering waterways and ecosystems
due to unprecedented commercial use [66,67], was also predicted to be degradable by the
full consortium.
Importantly, not only do these strains contain predicted genes capable of degrading
multiple plastic types, but they are also predicted to degrade common plasticizers, includ-
ing phthalates, paraben, and other aromatic/phenolic compounds. These plasticizers leach
and are ecotoxic, unlike most inert plastics [68]. This illustrates the capability of consortia
to degrade mixed plastic types, including those with certain additives. Plasticizers are
crucial in the discussion of plastic wastes, as they leach over time [69,70] and are of concern,
as research has shown them to be acutely toxic to humans and the environment [ 71–73].
Additives have historically been largely unregulated [74], and many are not required to be
disclosed or labeled. While certain additives have shown to be biodegradable [75], many
are not, as many products seek to be anti-microbial.
These plasticizers pose challenges for not only biological recycling efforts but also for
conventional chemical and mechanical recycling, as they limit how many times a plastic
can be recycled, if at all [74]. Even though microorganisms are slowly and globally utilizing
plastics as a carbon source, without a collaborative effort, the plastic pollution problem
will only worsen. Luckily, some efforts to increase the regulation of and research into
plasticizers are ongoing [76]. Research surrounding plasticizers’ environmental toxicity
and biodegradability, if intended to be part of single-use products, should be fully consid-
ered. With the proper governmental regulation of non-toxic plastic additives amenable to
biodegradation [75], it is possible to pursue biological consortia-based approaches toward
plastic recycling and bio-upcycling efforts.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Omics Approaches
4.1.1. Pangenome Analysis
Genomes deposited in GenBank (BioProject Accession: PRJNA517285) were uploaded
to the MicroScope (LABGeM, Courcouronnes, FRA) [ 37] website for expert annotation
and comparative genomic analysis using the Pan-genome Analysis tool. Pangenomes
and core/variable genomes were generated using MicroScope gene families (MICFAM)
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 14 of 22
computed using SiLiX software [38]. MICFAM parameters were set to 50% aa identity/80%
alignment coverage. The core genomes of 232 genomes (i.e., all Pseudomonas (144) and
Bacillus (88) species, within the MicroScope platform database (excluding the ﬁve strains
within the full consortium) at the time of this analysis) were excluded from the analysis.
Supplemental Figure S1 contains a phylogram of all species included in the analysis.
4.1.2. PMBD Analysis
The PMBD database is comprised of 949 microorganisms with 79 genes indicated in
the biodegradation of plastics and more than 8000 annotated enzymes/proteins predicted
to be involved in plastics biodegradation [ 36]. The annotated pangenomes of all ﬁve
strains within the full consortium were obtained from the MicroScope platform [37]. These
sequences were BLASTED against the PMBD database; e-value cutoff >0.001 and sequences
with greater than 20% percent identity were considered signiﬁcant alignments.
4.2. RNA Sequencing to Determine Genes Implicated in PET Biodegradation
4.2.1. Total RNA Extraction and Sequencing
Bacterial cultures of the full consortium were prepared in Liquid Carbon Free Media
(LCFBM) as published [25] with either 1% ( w/v) granular PET or L-asparagine. Optical
Density measurements at 600 nm (OD600) were used to determine when the culture had
reached mid to late exponential phase of growth. L-asparagine was harvested after reaching
exponential phase at an OD600 of 0.300 A, and the PET samples were harvested once they
reached an optical density of 0.200 A. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in RNAprotect
bacteria reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) to prevent RNA degradation and frozen
at –80 ◦C until time of extraction.
As extraction of total RNA from mixed culture of bacteria may present bias against
species within the culture, RNA extraction was conducted according to the GTC method
and DNA removal previously described by Stark et al. 2014 for the most efﬁcient extraction
rate for both Bacillus and Pseudomonas [77]. All chemicals required were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Total RNA extractions were tested for
purity and quantity using a Nanodrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Waltham,
MA, USA) and Qubit™ 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Illumina prokary-
otic RNA sequencing was completed by Novogene Beijing Bioinformatics Technology, Co.,
Ltd. Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Novogene, Beijing, CHN).
4.2.2. RNAseq Analysis
Paired-end Illumina RNA sequences were generated for two control and two exper-
imental samples. The quality of the raw reads was assessed with FastQC v0.11.3 [ 78].
After QC v0.9.6 was run to separate and retain high-quality sequences [79], high-quality
transcripts were then used to recruit onto each individual genome within the consortium
using Bowtie2 v2.3.5.1 [80]. SAM ﬁles were generated using Samtools v1.10 [81]. Expres-
sion was calculated and normalized using FeatureCounts v2.0.1 [ 82]. Once expression
was calculated, differential expression between the control and the experimental treat-
ments was calculated using the Bioconductor/R packages DESeq2 v1.34.0 and EdgeR
v3.36.9 [83,84]. Upregulated genes for each individual genome were analyzed at a cut-off
e-value of 0.05. Speciﬁc genes/enzymes associated with PET degradation were selected if
they were upregulated in relation to the control.
4.3. Evaluation of Carbon Source Utilization and Strain Bioﬁlm Production
4.3.1. Biolog EcoPlates
The growth of overnight bacterial cultures grown in LB was measured via OD 600.
They were rinsed as previously described [25] and diluted to 0.1 A before their addition to
each plate. Observance of purple color was indicative of respiration, as the cells reduce
the tetrazolium dye included within each carbon source in the plate. Thirty-one carbon
sources, in triplicate, were evaluated kinetically according to the manufacturer’s instruction
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 15 of 22
(Biolog EcoPlate, Hayward, CA, USA) using a colorimetric assay (clear to purple, OD590)
via a Tecan inﬁnite M200PRO microplate reader (Tecan, Zürich, CHE) over a 24-h period
(over 80,000 s) at room temperature (25 ±2 ◦C). Triplicate values were averaged in Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) analysis of relative absorbance for each
sample over time, which was determined via subtraction of the control (water) to account
for spontaneous tetrazolium dye formation.
To examine quantitative relationships between the strains and their ability to uti-
lize the 31 unique carbon sources, two calculations were performed to determine the
functional diversity based on all 31 carbon sources and the strain’s/consortium’s relative
similarity (Ssm).
% Functional Diversity = (a ÷31) ×100.
% Similarity (Ssm) = ((a + d) ÷(a + b + c + d)) ×100.
a = the number of carbon sources used by strains and consortia.
b = the number of carbon sources used the strain of interest only.
c = the number of carbon sources used by the full consortium/other strain only.
d = the number of carbon sources not utilized by either.
4.3.2. Microtiter Plate Bioﬁlm Quantiﬁcation Assay
Growth of overnight bacterial cultures for individual strains incubated in LB at 26 ◦C
was measured via OD600. Cells were rinsed, followed by dilution in M63 media toOD600 = 1.
A suspension of the full consortium was created by combining equal volumes of the ﬁve
individual strain suspensions. These suspensions were further diluted to 1:100 in M63
supplemented with 0.2% ethanol, 1 mM MgSO4, and 0.5% casamino acids and transferred
to a polystyrene FALCON non-tissue culture treated microtiter plate (Corning, Corning,
New York, USA) (100 µL/well). Negative controls consisted of supplemented M63 only.
After 48 h of incubation at 26 ◦C, planktonic growth was removed, and the wells were
gently washed with 125 µL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Bioﬁlms were stained
with 0.1% crystal violet (125 µL/well) for 15 min and then washed three times with 125 µL
PBS. The remaining dye was solubilized with 100% ethanol (200 µL/well) for 15 min, then
100 µL/well was transferred to a new polystyrene microtiter plate. The optical density
of solution in each well was measured at 600 nm using a microplate reader (Inﬁnite 200,
TECAN, Grödig, Salzburg, AUT).
4.4. Mutant Preparation of ∆estB
Single gene deletion of estB in Pseudomonas strain 9.2 was performed as previously
described [40]. Brieﬂy, primers were designed to amplify fragments upstream and down-
stream of estB (upstream forward, 5′-ccgggtaccgagctcgaattCACGATCGCCAGAGTGGATT-
3′and upstream reverse, 5′-ggcgacccctgtcgcaattgGGCTGCTCCAATTGTGTGCG-3′; down-
stream forward, 5′-cgcacacaattggagcagccCAATTGCGACAGGGGTCGCC-3′and down-
stream reverse, 5′-tatgaccatgattacgaattTAACCCAGCACCTGAGCCTG-3′, uppercase indi-
cates annealing segment). These primers contain overhang segments to facilitate ligation
into the vector pEX18Tcusing an NEB Gibson Assembly kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA, USA). Correct assembly of the vector was conﬁrmed by amplifying the MCS using
pEX18Tc universal primers (forward, 5′-GGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTG-3′and re-
verse, 5′-GGATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAG-3′) and sequencing that fragment (ACGT Se-
quencing, Wheeling, IL, USA). Assembled vector with ﬂankingestB fragments (pRDEXestB)
was transformed into Pseudomonas strain 9.2, and merodiploids were selected by growth on
LB-tetracycline (15 µg/mL). Deletion of estB was induced by growing merodiploids of su-
crose plates (TYS10) and was conﬁrmed by amplifying and sequencing a fragment spanning
slightly upstream and downstream ofestB (forward, 5′-CGCTGACACCCAGTACTGCAGC-
3′and reverse, 5′-GATCGAGATCAGGAACGCGGCG-3′). All PCR conducted utilized a
touchdown protocol with Q5 polymerase.

4.5. EstB Puriﬁcation
4.5.1. Ampliﬁcation and Puriﬁcation of estB Vector Insert
Primers were designed using Benchling (Benchling, San Francisco, CA, USA) to
amplify estB without its start or stop codon in order to express EstB with a C-terminal
T7 tag and an N-terminus 6xHis tag. These designed primers included partial over-
hangs to allow for assembly into the expression vector. The primers are as follows:
forward, 5′-atgggtcgcggatccgaattGACCGAGCCCTTGATTCTTCAGCCC-3′, reverse, 5 ′-
ttgtcgacggagctcgaattGCGCAGGCGTTCGCTCAACCAT-3′(uppercase characters indicates
annealing segment). PCR was performed using genomic DNA obtained by incubating
one colony of Pseudomonas strain 9.2 in 100 µL DNase-free water at 100 ◦C for 5 min
(2 µL of this solution was used for a 20 µL PCR reaction). Each PCR contained 0.5 µM of
forward and reverse primers, 200 µM dNTPs, 1×Q5 high GC enhancer, and 0.02 U/µL
Q5 DNA polymerase in a 1 ×Q5 reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).
The thermocycler was programmed with a touchdown PCR protocol as follows: 98 ◦C for
1 min, 16 cycles of 98 ◦C for 10 s, 68 ◦C for 30 s with a 0.5 ◦C decrease every cycle, 72 ◦C
for 20 s, followed by 30 cycles of 98 ◦C for 10 s, 60 ◦C for 30 s, 72 ◦C for 20 s, followed by a
ﬁnal extension of 72 ◦C for 2 min. Fragments were conﬁrmed through gel electrophoresis
and extracted and puriﬁed using a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA).
4.5.2. Assembly, Isolation, and Puriﬁcation of RDpET24estB Expression Vector
The expression vector pET-24a(+) was linear by restriction digest with EcoRI. Gibson
assembly was performed using reagents from NEB Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit. The
reaction mix contained 1×Gibson master mix and a 4:1 molar ratio of insert to linearized
plasmid (0.116 pmol estB insert and 0.029 pmol linearized pET-24a(+) vector). The reaction
mixture was incubated at 50 ◦C for 15 min, then transformed into NEB 5-alpha E. coli via
heat shock and plated on LB-kanamycin agar media. Transformants were inoculated in
LB-kanamycin media, and plasmid DNA was extracted using a QIAGEN plasmid isolation
kit. PCR was performed on both the transformant and the puriﬁed plasmid to conﬁrm
that the vector was correctly assembled. The primers used are the T7 universal primers
for the pET-24a(+) vector: forward, 5 ′-TAATAACGACTCACTAATAGG-3′, reverse, 5 ′-
GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. PCR was performed using either genomic DNA obtained
by incubating one colony of NEB 5-alpha E. coli in 100 µL DNase-free water at 100 ◦C for
5 min (2 µL of this solution was used for a 20 µL PCR reaction) or 10 ng of puriﬁed plasmid.
Each PCR contained 0.5 µM of forward and reverse primers, 200 µM dNTPs, 1×Q5 high
GC enhancer, 0.02 U/µL Q5 DNA polymerase in a 1×Q5 reaction buffer. The thermocycler
was programmed with a touchdown PCR protocol as follows: 98 ◦C for 1 min, 10 cycles
of 98 ◦C for 10 s, 60 ◦C for 30 s with a 1 ◦C decrease every cycle, 72 ◦C for 20 s, followed
by 30 cycles of 98 ◦C for 10 s, 50 ◦C for 30 s, 72 ◦C for 20 s, followed by a ﬁnal extension of
72 ◦C for 2 min. Fragments were conﬁrmed through gel electrophoresis and puriﬁed using
a QIAGEN PCR puriﬁcation kit.
4.5.3. Electroporation of BL21 E. Coli
An overnight culture of BL21 E. coli (8 mL, OD600 = 0.5) was pelleted by centrifugation
(8000 rpm) for 10 min. Supernatant was discarded, and pellet was washed (3 ×1 mL
ice-cold 10% glycerol) before being resuspended in 200 µL 10% glycerol. Roughly 0.5 µg of
RDpET24estB vector was added to 50 µL cell suspension and incubated on ice for 1 min.
Mixture was transferred to a pre-chilled electroporation cuvette and pulsed at 2.2 kV for
5.7 ms using a Bio-Rad MicroPulser (Bio-Rad. Hercules, CA, USA) before being transferred
to 1 mL S.O.C. media and incubated in a 37 ◦C shaker for 1 h. Cells were plated on three
individual LB agar plates containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin as follows: 50 and 100 µL of
the solution, followed by pelleting the remaining solution via centrifugation (12,000 rpm)
and reducing the total supernatant volume to 100 µL before resuspending the pellet and
plating that solution. The plates were incubated at 37 ◦C overnight. Transformants were
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 17 of 22
conﬁrmed by PCR and gel electrophoresis (procedure identical to the PCR performed in
the previous section).
4.5.4. Expression and Puriﬁcation of EstB
Two ﬂasks containing 250 mL LB media with 30 µg/mL kanamycin were inoculated
with BL21 E. coli containing the RDpET24estB expression vector and were grown shaking
at 37 ◦C to an OD600 of 0.6. Once the desired OD600 was achieved, IPTG was added to
each ﬂask to a concentration of 0.1 mM, and the cultures were grown shaking at 16 ◦C
overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm) at 4 ◦C, supernatant was
discarded, and pellet was resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl,
pH 8). Half a cOmplete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, Mannheim, DEU) and
lysozyme from chicken egg white (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to 0.4 mg/mL was
added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min, vortexing frequently to ensure
the protease tablet dissolved. Cells were lysed via sonication (6 ×10 s on, 20 s off, 70%
power) before the solution was centrifuged (16,000 rpm) for 30 min at 4 ◦C. Roughly 10 mL
of QIAGEN Ni-NTA agarose solution was pelleted by centrifugation (1600 rpm) for 5 min
at 4 ◦C. Resin was allowed to settle for 5 min before discarding supernatant. The resin
was washed (3 ×10 mL water, 1600 rpm centrifugation) before a ﬁnal wash with 10 mL
lysis buffer. Lysate was added to the resin and allowed to bind by gently shaking and
inverting the tube for 1 h at 4◦C. Lysate-resin mixture was applied to a column and allowed
to empty via gravity. Column was washed ﬁrst with 5×column volumes (CVs) of wash
buffer A (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8), then 3×CVs of wash
buffer B (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8). Elution was done by
adding a 3×CVs elution buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8).
The ﬂow-through from each CV added was collected in a different test tube and stored at
4 ◦C. Resin was washed 2×CVs elution buffer, then 2×CVs water, before being stored in
10 mL 20% ethanol at 4 ◦C. Puriﬁcation of EstB was conﬁrmed through SDS PAGE. Elutions
containing only protein were pooled and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH
8.0 buffer. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm
with a NanoDrop-1000 (Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA, USA), and through a BCA Assay
Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). Aliquots of protein solutions in 25%
glycerol and 1 mM DTT were stored at −20 ◦C.
4.6. Screening Puriﬁed EstB and Mutant ∆estB for Esterase Activity
Mutants: Esterase activity was quantiﬁed based on the absorbance of 4-nitrophenol
at 402 nm released from the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenol butyrate [ 39]. The following
reactions were performed in 200 µL volumes and in triplicate: just buffer (LCFBM), buffer
with 4-nitrophenol butyrate (1.2 mM), and buffer with 4-nitrophenol butyrate and culture
(1.2 mM, OD600 = 0.1 in reaction volume). The microplate reader (Tecan) was set to10 cycles
of 30 min at room temperature and measuring absorbance at 402 nm.
Enzyme: Esterase activity was quantiﬁed based on the absorbance of 4-nitrophenol at
402 nm released from the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenol butyrate. In a solution of acetoni-
trile:isopropanol (1:4 v/v) 4-nitrophenol butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
solubilized to 20 mM and stored at 4 ◦C. The following reaction conditions were performed
in 200 µL reaction volumes in a clear 96-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY), with each
reaction performed in triplicate: just buffer (50 mM HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5), buffer with
4-nitrophenol butyrate (1 mM), buffer with estB (5 nM), and buffer with 4-nitrophenol
butyrate (1 mM) and estB (5 nM). Absorbance of each well was measured every min for
30 min at 402 nm by a microplate reader (Tecan).
4.7. Screening for PET and BHET Degradation
4.7.1. Synthesis of microPET and nanoPET
MicroPET was synthesized as outlined by Rodríguez-Hernández et al. [85] in order to
increase the exposed surface area of the material and enhance degradation. Post-consumer
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 18 of 22
PET soda bottles (Coke and Pepsi) were cut into 1 cm strips of various lengths, discarding
the caps and taking care to discard any labels. A total of 50 g of post-consumer PET strips
were placed into a sterilized stainless steel blender (Waring Commercial, Stamford, CT,
USA), and liquid N2 was added until it fully covered the strips. The blender was set to
high, and the liquid nitrogen was replaced until the PET was ground into a mixture of
dust and small, jagged pieces. A total of 1 g of this ground PET mix was added to a beaker
containing 10 mL of 90% (v/v) triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) and stirred for an hour until the
PET was fully dissolved. Following the solvation of PET, 10 mL of 20% ( v/v) TFA was
added to the beaker and left overnight to let the PET crystalize out of solution. The mixture
was then centrifuged at 6000 RCF (2496 G) for 1 h and the supernatant was discarded and
replaced with 100 mL of a resuspension solution composed of 0.5% (w/w) sodium dodecyl
sulfate. This mixture was ultrasonicated (5×, t = 10 s) via Misonix 3000 sonicator (Misonix,
Farmingdale, NY, USA) until it became a milky white color, after which the microPET
was allowed to settle to the bottom of the bottle overnight. The upper aqueous layer was
carefully decanted to separate the nanoPET suspension from the microPET present in the
bottom layer.
4.7.2. BHET and PET Hydrolysis Assay
Degradation of BHET by EstB was assayed as previously described [86]. BHET buffer
was made by adding BHET (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to 1 mM in 40 mM
NaH2PO4, 80 mM NaCl, 20% (v/v) DMSO, pH 7.5 and stirred overnight to dissolve. Com-
plete dissolution of the BHET particles was not observed, but their size was dramatically
reduced to an estimated microparticle size (<300 µm). EstB (50 µg) was added to 1 mL of
BHET buffer and incubated shaking at 40 ◦C overnight. Blank assays, in which no protein
was added, were used as controls. All assays were performed in triplicate.
The concentration of SDS in the microPET suspension was dramatically reduced by
centrifuging the microPET suspension at 12,000 rpm and removing the supernatant before
adding an equal volume of Ultrapure water. This procedure was repeated three times to
yield a microPET suspension with a very low SDS concentration. EstB (100 µg) was added
to 1 mL of PET buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 0.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mL washed microPET, 20% (v/v)
DMSO, pH 8) and incubated shaking at 40 ◦C overnight. Blank assays, in which no protein
was added, were used as controls. All assays were performed in triplicate.
4.7.3. PET Monomer Analysis Using HPLC
Analysis of PET oligomers and monomers were adapted from Furukawa et al. 2019 [87]
using an Agilent Technologies 1100 series HPLC equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus
C18 (Rapid Resolution, 4.6 ×100 mm 3.5 Micron) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). The ﬂow rate, mobile phase, and oven temperature were as previously
described [87]. Hydrolyzed products were observed at 254 nM, with a reference at 354 nM.
TPA and BHET standards were used to detect peak retention times. The column used
in this experiment resulted in signiﬁcantly shorter retention times compared to previous
literature values. Retention times on average for TPA at 1.5 min and BHET at 1.9 min.
Experimentally, MHET was expected around 1.7 min.
5. Conclusions
Plastic pollution is choking our planet, with more of these materials being made
and released into marine and terrestrial environments every year. Though occurring at a
slow pace, microbes are able to degrade these man-made polymers. Species of bacteria,
including Pseudomonas and Bacillus, have been implicated in the biodegradation of PET
plastic, but very few speciﬁc enzymes within these organisms have been identiﬁed and
characterized [88] (ref). Here we use “omics” approaches and existing databases to elucidate
the genetic basis of how a consortium of soil bacteria can cooperate to degrade PET
plastic, a model for how this may be occurring in the environment. Using molecular
techniques, we identiﬁed a new EstB PETase encoded in Pseudomonas spp., an initial
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 5612 19 of 22
depolymerizer, with the potential for additional PETases to be identiﬁed and characterized
within the pangenome. Unlike bacteria isolated from plastic in marine environments,
these Pseudomonas and Bacillus bacteria isolated from petroleum polluted soils have robust
plastic- and plasticizer-degrading capabilities, including 250 associated enzymes among
ﬁve strains, demonstrating the potential for biodegradation of mixed plastic waste.
