Plastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are vital in modern life, with 
global production exceeding 400 million tons annually. This extensive use has 
led to signiﬁcant plastic waste pollution, highlighting the need for effective 
recycling strategies. PET, one of the most recycled plastics, is a prime candidate 
for degradation into its original monomers through engineered PET hydrolases – 
enzymes with industrial potential. While previous engineering efforts have mainly 
focused on enhancing thermostability and catalytic efﬁciency, the crucial aspect 
of enzyme adsorption to PET surfaces has received less attention. This review 
speciﬁcally addresses the mechanisms of enzyme adsorption, detailing relevant 
experimental methods and simulation techniques while emphasizing the poten-
tial for engineering more effective PET hydrolases.

Discovery and potential of PET hydrolases 
The existence of enzymes capable of degrading PET (see Glossary), a synthetic anthropogenic 
polyme
r not found in nature, is remarkable. While enzymes have evolved to effectively target nat-
ural substrates, the presence of these enzymes that can degrade PET is surprising at ﬁrst glance. 
However, upon closer examination, one ﬁnds that there are hydrolysable synthetic polymers like 
PET that share structural similarities, such as ester bonds, with natural polyesters like cutin, which 
are substrates for hydrolases. Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinase (TfC) was the ﬁrst PET-degrading en-
zyme discovered, as described in 2005 [1]. 
Since then, a number of PET hydrolases have been identiﬁed and advanced [2], including the 
lea
f compost cutinase (LCC) and polyester hydrolase I (PES-H1, also known as PHL7) which 
were both derived from compost metagenome libraries in 2014 [3] and 2022 [4], respectively. 
LCC 
shows high activity against PET and exhibits cutinase-like properties, enabling the enzyme 
to break down polymer structures effectively. Building on this natural enzyme, the French 
company CARBIOS utilized the ICCG variant of LCC (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G) [5], en-
ab
ling them to successfully launch the ﬁrst enzymatic PET recycling demonstration plant in 
2021 with plans to open a larger facility with a recycling capacity of 130 tons per day in 2025 
(https://www.carbios.com/en/enzymatic-recycling/ ). Although PES-H1 is somewhat less ac-
tive 
than LCC [6], it is of industrial interest, as well, as it demonstrates a broader substrate 
sp
eciﬁcity that could be enhanced further through a two-enzyme system, similar to that em-
ployed by Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bacterium can effectively metabolize PET using 
the enzymes IsPETase and MHETase, which facilitate the complete degradation of PET into 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), ulti-
mately producing the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) [7].

charac
teristics on both amorphous and crystalline PET substrates, along with the temperatures 
at which these parameters were measured. It highlights how enzyme performance varies with
Highlights 
The existence of polyethylene terephthal-
ate (PET) hydrolases is striking, given that 
PET is a synthetic polymer and enzymes 
evolved for natural substrates. 
To enhance the applicability of PET hy-
drol
ases in industrial settings, targeted 
enzyme reengineering is essential. 
Strategies for improving PET hydrolases 
includ
e increasing thermostability, accel-
erating catalytic reactions, and optimiz-
ing binding to PET substrates. 
According to the Sabatier principle, 
achiev
ing optimal binding strength be-
tween PET and PET hydrolases is crucial 
for effective catalysis.

temperature and PET substrate crystallinity, with higher temperatures generally improving activity. 
Additionally, many values remain unestablished, underscoring the need for a more comprehen-
sive understanding of enzymatic PET hydrolysis. To address this, Arnal et al. developed a stan-
dardized protocol for larger-scale studies, applying it to four PET hydrolases [16]. Their ﬁndings 
ide
ntiﬁed that FAST-PETase and HotPETase are unsuitable for large-scale applications due to 
low depolymerization rates, while PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y (PES-H1FY ) could be a promising candi-
date with 80% depolymerization upon further enzyme evolution. LCCICCG excelled, achieving 
98% PET conversion to TPA and EG in 24 h, and they improved its economic viability by reducing 
enzyme usage by a factor of 3 and lowering the reaction temperature from 72°C to 68°C. None-
theless, further optimization is crucial for enhancing the catalytic efﬁciency and environmental im-
pact of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, as current life cycle assessments show that enzymatic PET 
recycling still lags behind virgin PET production in most categories [17]. Therefore, we will ﬁrst ex-
amine the individual steps of the catalytic cycle, which present several opportunities for enzyme 
improvement, before focusing on the initial step: the adsorption of PET hydrolases onto the 
PET material.

The catalytic cycle and potential intervention points for engineering PET hydrolases 
PET degradation by PET hydrolases can be considered as heterogeneous catalysis, w h e r e 
the catalyst is in a different phase (here solution) than the substrate (here solid). Consequently, 
the catalytic cycle involves the following steps (Figure 1). (i) Adsorption: the PET hydrolase must 
ﬁrst 
come into contact with the surface of PET; (ii) enzyme–substrate complex formation: a PET 
chain must enter into the active site of the enzyme and adopt a pose ready for the hydrolysis re-
action to take place; (iii) catalytic action: the PET hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction by 
cleaving the ester bond(s) in the polymer chain; and (iv) product release: after the reaction, the 
products (e.g., shorter PET chains, BHET, MHET, TPA, and EG) must be released from the active 
site of the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to be free for additional catalytic cycles.
Insoluble substrates like PET present unique challenges for enzymes. Unlike soluble substrates 
tha
t easily dissolve in water and are accessible to enzymes, insoluble substrates remain solid 
and often possess complex structures that enzymes must navigate. The enzymatic hydrolysis 
of PET primarily involves surface erosion, where the outer polymer layer is degraded to expose 
inner material. Due to the inability of water and enzyme molecules to penetrate the polymer’s 
core, only a limited number of ester bonds are accessible for enzymatic action. Additionally, inter-
facial enzymes, such as PET hydrolases, must overcome attractive forces within the substrate 
matrix to form a productive enzyme–substrate complex. 
Based on the PET hydrolase catalytic cycle, one can focus on one or more of the four major steps 
to in
crease its efﬁciency. Most approaches so far emphasize optimizing the second and third 
steps, speciﬁcally the binding of PET in the active site and the catalytic reaction. It is important 
to consider the material properties of PET, a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with linear polymer 
strands forming both amorphous and crystalline regions (Figure 2). The mobility of the PET chains 
is temper
ature-dependent, transitioning from rigidity below the glass transition temperature 
(Tg) t o ﬂexibility above it. The differs between the amorphous and rigid regions, as well as be-
tween bulk PET and the surface, due to the plasticization effect of water [19–22]. Increased ﬂex-
ibility allows 
better access to ester bonds, enhancing enzymatic turnover [23]. Optimal PET 
biodegradation therefore 
occurs at 68–72°C [5,19,22,24,25], necessitating high thermostability 
in PET 
hydrolases. The thermostability of enzymes can be improved by introducing covalent di-
sulﬁde bridges, which resulted in increases in melting temperature (Tm) o f 2 0–30°C for various 
PET-degrading enzymes [26–28]. Techniques like directed evolution, machine learning (ML), 
and artiﬁcial 
intelligence (AI) have also been used to create thermostable enzyme variants, such

While elevated temperatures are needed for efﬁcient PET entry into the active site, increased 
polymer mobility enables recrystallization – a process known as physical aging – and a higher 
degree of crystallinity restricts PET access, reducing turnover [22,33,34]. This physical 
aging b
egins above 72°C for amorphous PET in an aqueous environment [5]. Therefore, devel-
oping high
ly efﬁcient enzymes that can outperform this competing physical aging process is 
essential [20,21], a challenge addressed through PET hydrolase engineer ing. To this end, 
many 
studies investigated the interactions between PET and amino acids near the active 
site, examining crystal structures of enzymes with PET analogs [6,35–41], as well as structures 
based o
n molecular docking [5,40,42–44], often followed by short MD simulations [6,45–49]. 
Stu
dies have replaced sterically demanding amino acids with smaller ones to widen the binding 
cleft of PET-degrading enzymes, enhancing activity due to improved accessibility [43,50–52]. 
However, 
such substitutions might lead to the loss of speciﬁc interactions with PET, weakening 
binding. In fact, in one study, narrowing the binding site and introducing amino acids with 
stronger PET interactions has led to increased activity [49]. Increased aromaticity [50] and hy-
drophobicity 
[52,53] near the active site also positively inﬂuence activity. A conserved trypto-
phan, 
known as ‘wobbling ’ tryptophan, located at one end of the catalytic binding cleft, 
enhances PET binding through π–π interactions with the benzene ring and improves product 
release [40,54]. 
To 
gain insights into the mechanistic details of the catalytic reaction beyond the assumptions de-
rived from crysta
l structures, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simula-
tions were conducted, with the ﬁrst studies on enzymatic PET hydrolysis published in 2021 
[55–57], followed by several other studies in subsequent years [58–61]. The mechanism consists 
of acylation, 
where the catalytic serine’s nucleophilicity is increased by proton transfer from the 
histidine, allowing for an attack on the PET ester’s carbonyl and the subsequent cleavage of 
the bond, and deacylation, where a water molecule attacks the acyl intermediate. Key mutations, 
such as the replacement of an isoleucine near the catalytic aspartate with alanine, resulted in a 
loss of activity, emphasizing the importance of nearby amino acids in stabilizing the catalytic as-
partate [62]. A recent QM/MM study disclosed that the acylation process in LCC and PES-H1, 
along with their 
more active mutants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , involves two distinct conformations 
of the PET benzene ring that enhance π–π interactions with the ‘wobbling’ tryptophan residue 
[63]. For the high-activity variants LCCICCG and PES-H1FY , a reduction of 2–5 kcal/mol in activa-
tion free energy was observed compared with their respective WT enzyme and partially explains 
their increased activity. Alternative to molecular simulations, AI also offers promising avenues for 
optimizing the active sites of PET hydrolases; for example, a recent study utilized a diffusion 
model combined with a neural network approach to design tailor-made enzymes, speciﬁcally 
generating novel serine hydrolases for the hydrolysis of PET [64]. 
Attempts were also made to increase enzymatic efﬁciency by addressing the ﬁrst step of the cat-
alytic cycle and 
modifying the interactions between PET hydrolases and the PET material. How-
ever, the collective ﬁndings from studies addressing these interactions indicate that this process 
is primarily nonspeciﬁc, which poses a challenge for enhancing enzymatic efﬁciency. In light of 
this, no explicit PET recognition site has been identiﬁed so far, prompting efforts to modify PET 
surface characteristics or fuse enzymes with binding domains to enhance adsorption [65]. For

example, carbohydrate-binding domains (CBMs), known for efﬁciently binding polymers like 
synthetic plastics [66,67], have been fused terminally with PET-degrading enzymes [68–73]. 
Thes
e studies demonstrated that the impact of CBM fusion on activity depends on various pa-
rameters such as the catalytic domain, linker type, substrate type, and substrate load. The fusion 
of small anchor peptides to HotPETase has yielded similar results as with CBMs [14]. Additionally, 
fusing 
hydrophobins or adding them as free molecules enhances PET degradation by PET hydro-
lases [74–76]. Hydrophobins are small glycoproteins that modify the surface properties of hydro-
phobic 
substrates like PET, increasing their hydrophilicity and facilitating enzyme adsorption from 
the aqueous phase. This improved binding raises the local concentration of the enzyme on the 
substrate surface, enhances wettability, and promotes hydrolytic breakdown of PET [74–78]. 
An innova
tive approach for PET degradation involved codisplaying IsPETase and a hydrophobin 
on yeast, signiﬁcantly increasing the degradation of highly crystalline PET compared with puriﬁed 
IsPETase [79]. Surfactants serve a similar function as hydrophobins, with their hydrophobic part 
binding 
to PET, while the charged part mediates contact with the enzyme, as demonstrated for 
IsPETase [80] and TfC2 [81].

In other studies the surface charge of the enzymes was directly addressed. For instance, Sagong 
et al. identiﬁed a positive effect by introducing negative charges in surface regions away from the 
catalytic center, while substitutions with negatively charged amino acids near the catalytic center 
resulted in reduced activity [82]. Jäckering et al. found that even substitutions involving only polar 
residu
es, rather than charged ones, on the protein surface far from the active site of PES-H1 sig-
niﬁcantly reduced its activity [8]. Thomsen et al. observed crater formation on the PET surface

crystallinity in combination with the enzyme’s negative surface charge [83]. As degradation in-
cr
eases the number of negatively charged carboxylic groups on the PET surface, it becomes 
more negative, repelling PES-H1 and resulting in crater formation rather than uniform degrada-
tion. These observations are supported by different studies that indicated a positive impact of a 
more neutral, hydrophobic enzyme surface on enzymatic activity [84–86]. However, enhancing 
PET 
adsorption does not always translate to increased PET hydrolase activity; in fact, improved 
activity can sometimes be achieved by reducing adsorption, as seen in LCC, where a decreased 
binding afﬁnity arises from cationic surfactants [9]. This observation aligns with the Sabatier prin-
ciple
, which posits that there is an optimal binding afﬁnity for achieving the most effective enzy-
matic activity. If the binding is too strong, it can hinder the release of the reactants after catalysis 
took place, reducing the catalytic turnover; conversely, if the binding is too weak, the catalyst may 
not hold the reactants long enough for the reaction to occur. Thus, an intermediate binding 
strength is ideal, as it maximizes catalytic efﬁciency by enabling enzymes to stabilize transition 
states without obstructing product release [87].

the enzymes can be reused for further plastic degradation.

Since the optimal binding between the PET surface and PET hydrolases has not yet been estab-
lished, and it remains unclear why surface mutations in the enzyme, distant from the active site, 
can signiﬁcantly reduce activity [8], it is essential to better understand the interplay between 
PET hydrol
ase binding and the characteristics of both the enzyme and the PET surface. Conse-
quently, the remainder of this review focuses on this aspect, discussing various experimental and 
simulation techniques that can be employed to further investigate these interactions. 
Experimental approaches for studying PET surface–PET hydrolase interactions 
Experimental methods are essential for elucidating the interactions between PET surfaces and 
hydrolases, providing direct observations and quantitative data for analyzing enzyme binding 
and activity. The techniques discussed in the following section are biophysical methods com-
monly employed to investigate interface-related problems, enabling the determination of binding 
afﬁnities, surface interactions, protein mobility, and the kinetics of the process. 
Langmuir isotherms are commonly used to determine protein binding to insoluble substrates. 
This model 
describes the adsorption of protein molecules onto a homogeneous solid substrate 
surface with identical binding sites, assuming independent protein binding, monolayer formation, 
and reversible binding. Despite their simplicity, the Langmuir isotherms are often overlooked in 
PET hydrolase studies. Nonetheless, in one study the method was applied to measure the inter-
actions between semi-crystalline PET powder and three different PET hydrolases, two cutinases 
(TfC and HiC from Humicola insolens) and a variant of the IsPETase, under conditions of both en-
zyme and substrate excess [65]. The binding process was reasonably described by a Langmuir 
isot
herm, indicating a strong afﬁnity for the PET substrate, with dissociation constants consis-
tently below 150 nM. The saturated substrate coverage for all three enzymes roughly 
corresponded to a monolayer on the PET surface. No speciﬁc ligand binding contributions in 
the active site were identiﬁed, suggesting that adsorption is predominantly driven by nonspeciﬁc 
interactions, unlike enzymes naturally evolved to degrade insoluble polymers. However, a corre-
lation was observed between the progression of enzymatic hydrolysis and increased binding

capacity, likely due to surface modiﬁcations of the PET polymer over time. In another study, 
Langmuir isotherms identiﬁed that fusing CBMs to a variant of LCC improved the afﬁnity of the en-
zyme to PET [72]. Binding isotherms, along with zeta potential measurements that quantify the 
electrical 
charge on the surface of particles such as proteins in a liquid, helped explain the differ-
ences in activity as a function of salt concentration for several HiC homologs.

An inverse Michaelis–Menten approach has been used to assess the kinetics of PET hydrolases 
and their interaction with the PET surface. Besides the kinetic parameters, this approach provides 
the number of attack sites on the PET surface. Speciﬁcally, one kinetic data set is collected using 
the conventional method with the substrate in excess, while another is collected in an inverse con-
centration regime with enzyme in excess (Figure 3A) [9]. This approach has been applied using either 
PET p
owder or ﬁlm of varying crystallinity, yielding substrate afﬁnity, turnover rate, catalytic efﬁciency, 
and the ability to identify attack sites on PET, thereby facilitating the identiﬁcation of rate-limiting steps 
[9,15,88–91]. For example, it was used to compare an engineered PET hydrolase, TurboPETase, 
with other 
PET hydrolases. It was suggested that TurboPETase’s enhanced depolymerization per-
formance may, at least in part, be due to its improved ability to target a broader range of speciﬁc a t -
tack sites that can be hydrolyzed [88]. The inverse Michaelis–Menten approach was also used to

study the effect of the surfactant cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the enzymatic activity 
and strength of enzyme–PET interactions of LCC and TfC [9]. CTAB consistently reduced the inter-
action 
strength, while its effect on enzymatic turnover exhibited a strong biphasic response. Initially, 
increasing the concentration of CTAB enhanced turnover, but beyond a certain point, the turnover 
was suppressed. This correlation reﬂects the Sabatier principle [9].

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), combined with thermokinetic models, was employed to 
conduct a detailed analysis of the degradation process of PET nanoparticles by TfC2 [92]. An in-
v
erse Michaelis–Menten-based model was used for the data analysis. The results determined 
that about 95% of the heat produced during PET degradation can be attributed to the heat of re-
action, while only about 5% was due to the heat of adsorption. 
The effect of surface mutations on a PET hydrolase, PET2, identiﬁed from a metagenome library, 
was 
investigated using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This tech-
nique enables single-molecule imaging, allowing for the tracking of binding rate constants 
(Figure 3B). The most active mutant exhibited an increased binding rate constant, which was sug-
ges
ted to explain its higher activity compared with the WT enzyme [37]. In another study, TIRF 
mi
croscopy was combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) mi-
croscopy to examine how two green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP) labeled PET hydrolases, LCC 
and PES-H1 (aka PHL7), and their CBM fusion variants attach and detach from a PET surface. 
TIRF microscopy was optimized for measuring the on and off rates of the enzymes, while 
FRAP microscopy was used to assess the dynamic movement rates of proteins across the 
PET surface. The study showed that adsorption and desorption dominate over lateral diffusion 
[93]. Similarly, single-molecule binding dynamics of quantum dot-labeled IsPETase were studied 
us
ing TIRF microscopy. Speciﬁcally, the landing rate and the binding duration were measured. 
The binding durations were well described by a biexponential model, featuring a fast population 
interpreted as active binding events and a slow population representing nonspeciﬁc binding inter-
actions [94]. Additionally, a simpliﬁed form of TIRF microscopy was utilized to study enzyme den-
sity 
and distribution on the PET surface, providing insights into the protein concentration-
dependent activity reduction of IsPETase [95]. 
The quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is a method that al-
lows 
for real-time monitoring of PET hydrolysis, enabling the determination of depolymerization 
kinetics. This was demonstrated for TfC2 and its mutants, where QCM-D was used to analyze 
the degradation kinetics of PET spun-coated onto a gold sensor (Figure 3C), which revealed 
two 
distinct phases: an ‘initial hydrolysis phase’ and a ‘fast hydrolysis phase’ [97]. Furthermore, 
earlier 
research employed QCM to evaluate the effects of fusing binding proteins including 
CBMs to a PET hydrolase on the hydrolysis kinetics [69]. 
Thermal treatment of a WCCG variant of LCC was shown to enhance PET hydrolysis. To eluci-
date the underlying reasons, atomic force microscopy-single-molecule force spectros-
copy (AFM-SMFS) w a s e m p l o y e d t o a s s e s s e n z y m e a d s o r p t i o n t o a P E Ts u r f a c e[89]. This 
method uses 
a sharp AFM tip to apply controlled forces to a single molecule measuring the forces 
needed to unfold or detach it from a surface, providing detailed insights into molecular interac-
tions, binding strengths, and conformational changes [98]. Untreated and thermally treated en-
zyme were applied to the AFM tip and approached a PET ﬁlm. Thermally treated enzyme 
showed higher adhesion force than the untreated one. It was hypothesized that thermal treat-
ment increases the hydrophobicity of the protein surface [89]. AFM-SMFS was also used to dem-
onstrate 
that hydrophobic anchor peptides promote adhesive interactions between HotPETase 
fused with different anchor peptides and the PET surface [14].

We ﬁnd it important to note that the outcome of all the experimental methods described depends 
on the properties of the PET substrate. The degree of crystallinity is crucial when assaying and 
comparing the activity of PET hydrolases on insoluble PET, with enzymatic activity increasing 
when the crystallinity decreases [18,23,73,83]. However, crystallinity is an overall estimate and 
does 
not reﬂect the speciﬁc properties of the PET surface where the PET hydrolases act. 
Some PET hydrolases create holes in the substrate, likely targeting amorphous areas of the sub-
strate surface [83]. So far, no experimental framework has yet fully captured the relationship be-
twee
n PET surface morphology and PET hydrolase activity [99]. Single-molecule microscopy 
methods 
and QCM-D face challenges in preparing the PET surface, as PET is dissolved in an or-
ganic solvent before being cast onto a cover slip. This process results in a PET layer that is not 
directly comparable with insoluble PET substrates used in activity analyses. Furthermore, PET au-
toﬂuorescence issues require pretreatment of the PET surface and extensive data processing 
[37,93]. 
Molecular simulations for studying PET surface–PET hydrolase interactions 
Molecular simulations offer a promising complement to experimental approaches for understand-
ing PET hydrolase interactions with PET surfaces. By allowing precise control over variables like 
surface morphology and molecular interactions, simulations can provide detailed insights into 
mechanistic relationships that are challenging to capture experimentally; however, they also 
come with their own challenges, which are discussed later. While the docking and QM/MM sim-
ulations provide crucial insights into the processes within the active site (discussed earlier), they 
are not able to explain how the enzymes adsorb on the PET material and how PET reaches the 
active site. These questions can be addressed by classical MD simulations where PET is modeled 
as a material in its amorphous, crystalline, or mixed amorphous/crystalline state (Figure 2) and the 
respect
ive enzyme is placed above the material to monitor the adsorption process. 
In the study by Sahihi et al., the adsorption of LCCICCG on amorphous PET consisting of PET-
9mer chains at 65°C was simulated [100]. The enzyme was always positioned such that the ac-
tive 
site faced the PET material and was only about 5 Å away. Consequently, the enzyme always 
bound with the same area to the PET surface, and this interaction occurred rapidly and was me-
diated by hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and π–π interactions between PET chains and various 
amino 
acid residues of the cutinase enzyme. Not a b l y , t h e p r e s e n c e o f t h e e n z y m e a i d e d i n 
extracting a PET monomer into the water.
Jäckering et al. conducted a detailed analysis of PET hydrolase binding to amorphous PET at 
30°C 
for LCC and PES-H1, starting from random orientations at least 10 Å away from a bulk of 
PET-9mers [8]. Their ﬁndings indicated that initial adsorption is predominantly nonspeciﬁc, occur-
ring 
in both proximal and distal regions relative to the enzymes’ active site, with minimal protein 
reorientation taking place on the PET surface, even when extending simulations to 2 μs 
(Figure 4 A). Interaction energy analysis disclosed that mainly polar and hydrophobic interactions 
drive 
adsorption, while repulsion occurs with negatively charged residues, which are more prev-
alent in PES-H1 compared with LCC (Figure 4B). To further explore the role of speciﬁc a m i n o 
a
cids in PET interactions, surface residues were mutated to weaken PET binding, primarily re-
placing positively charged and polar residues with negatively charged ones or alanine 
(Figure 4C,D). In silico simulations of the resulting triple mutants guided the selection for in vitro 
testing 
using the inverse Michaelis –Menten approach, but the LCC mutant could not be 
expressed despite mutations being distant from the active site. Meanwhile, the PES-H1 T11V/ 
S13A/S14A mutant exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced PET degradation activity. This observation 
aligns with the Sabatier principle, indicating that the PES-H1 triple mutant may have weakened 
interactions too much for optimal catalysis [ 8]. These results highlight the importance of

understanding enzymatic adsorption to PET, as even minor distant mutations can greatly affect 
protein stability and activity through alterations in PET adsorption dynamics.

eventually productively bound) on the enzyme structure, with sphere color indicating entry progress from cyan to

Since Jäckering et al. did not observe PET-9mer penetration into the binding cleft during their 
2 μs MD simulations at 30°C, this indicates an energy barrier impeding PET entry into the active 
site. 
To investigate this further, they employed Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dy-
namics (HREMD), modifying the energy function of PET to enhance its mobility at higher rep-
licas, thereby allowing exploration of PET entry for the ﬁrst time in LCC and PES-H1 [8]. This 
approa
ch conﬁrmed the energy barrier’s presence, attributed to intramolecular PET–PET interac-
tions needing resolution before PET could insert into the binding cleft, along with intermolecular 
PET–residue interactions hindering productive binding poses. It was found that raising the tem-
perature to 70°C could overcome the obstructive PET–PET interactions, partly explaining why 
enzymatic PET degradation is generally more efﬁcient at higher temperatures (Table 1). Free en-
ergy 
analysis and principal component analysis of the HREMD data identiﬁed three main PET 
entry pathways (Figure 4E) and unfavorable PET–residue interactions that could be mitigated 
by 
mutations T211G in LCC and S68A in PES-H1, as conﬁrmed by in vitro tests.

Paiva et al. investigated the adsorptions process of the IsPETase on amorphous and crystalline 
PET [101]. MD simulations at 30°C of the PET–IsPETase systems identiﬁed a preference for 
the 
amorphous PET substrate, which correlat es with the established experimental data 
(Table 1). The computational models developed by Paiva et al. associate this tendency with a 
substa
ntially higher PET–IsPETase contact area, a better PET chain accessibility, and a beneﬁcial 
organization of the catalytic triad in the case of the amorphous PET substrate, which is evident 
from inspecting the molecular structures of crystalline and amorphous PET shown in Figure 2. 
The study by Chen et al. combined computational and experimental methods to obtain a 
complete 
catalytic pathway for the e nzymatic degradation of PET by the IsPETase and 
with that providing additional information on t he functional properties of PET hydrolases 
[102]. This includes enzyme binding, PET fragment capture, conformational reﬁnement, at-
tain
ment of the ﬁnal pre-cleavage conformation, and ester bond cleavage. The conducted 
MD simulations allowed for the sampling cleavable PET conformations and provided an ex-
planation for the experimentally observed enzyme inactivation in the form of conformational 
ﬂuctuations in the catalytic loop. While for IsPETase these ﬂuctuations may increase the 
PET capture capability at the cost of enzyme stability, a comparison with its more thermosta-
ble mutant, the HotPETase, led to the conclusion that this activity–stability trade-off can be 
overcome through directed evolution. 
An MD study focusing on crystalline PET explored the adsorption of CBMs as promising candi-
dates 
for fusion with PET hydrolases to enhance enzyme activity by increasing substrate afﬁnity 
[66]. This study started with an in vitro analysis of eight CBMs for their PET binding afﬁnity. A 
fast 
and reliable PET surface afﬁnity assay was developed for semi-quantitative analysis of 
protein–PET interactions, which identiﬁed a Bacillus anthracis CBM from family 2 (BaCBM2) as 
a h i g h - a fﬁnity PET binder. MD simulations indicated that surface-exposed aromatic triads in 
BaCBM2 interacted with PET throug h-stacking – which is less signiﬁcant for binding to amor-
phous PET [8] – and polar interactions. These ﬁ ndings were supported by tryptophan ﬂuores-
cence quenching experiments, which allowed for the determination of a dissociation constant 
for BaCBM2 g L–1 ). The balance of hydrophobic to polar interactions at the CBM– 
PET interface differentiated high-afﬁnity binders, with BaCBM2 demonstrating an optimal ratio, 
from CBMs with lower afﬁnity [66]. 
Concluding remarks 
The remarkable similarity between man-made plastics and natural polymers allows certain en-
zymes, such as cutinases and other polyesterases, to effectively degrade plastics like PET. How-
ever, the WT forms of these enzymes often lack the efﬁciency required for practical industrial 
applications. To rationally enhance their performance, a thorough understanding of the heteroge-
neous catalytic process is essential, beginning with the adsorption of enzymes onto insoluble PET 
and culminating in product release. While many studies concentrate on elucidating the processes 
within the active sites of PET hydrolases, we advocate for increased research into the interactions 
between these enzymes and the PET material, both at the onset of degradation and during the 
process, particularly as PET undergoes structural and physicochemical changes due to short-
ened chains. As highlighted in this review, a diverse array of experimental and simulation tech-
niques is available to advance our understanding in this area. We encourage the integration of 
these methods to achieve a more comprehensive analysis. Ultimately, by gaining deeper insights 
into the surface processes involved in PET degradation, we can strategically modify PET hydro-
lase surfaces to achieve the optimal binding conditions described by the Sabatier principle, 
thereby enhancing their catalytic efﬁciency and paving the way for effective solutions in plastic 
waste management (see Outstanding questions).
