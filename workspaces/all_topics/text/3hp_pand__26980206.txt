Abstract 
Background: In the future, oil‑ and gas‑derived polymers may be replaced with bio‑based polymers, produced from 
renewable feedstocks using engineered cell factories. Acrylic acid and acrylic esters with an estimated world annual 
production of approximately 6 million tons by 2017 can be derived from 3‑hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), which can be 
produced by microbial fermentation. For an economically viable process 3HP must be produced at high titer, rate and 
yield and preferably at low pH to minimize downstream processing costs.
Results: Here we describe the metabolic engineering of baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for biosynthesis of 
3HP via a malonyl‑CoA reductase (MCR)‑dependent pathway. Integration of multiple copies of MCR from Chloroflexus 
aurantiacus and of phosphorylation‑deficient acetyl‑CoA carboxylase ACC1 genes into the genome of yeast increased 
3HP titer fivefold in comparison with single integration. Furthermore we optimized the supply of acetyl‑CoA by 
overexpressing native pyruvate decarboxylase PDC1, aldehyde dehydrogenase ALD6, and acetyl‑CoA synthase from 
Salmonella enterica SEacsL641P. Finally we engineered the cofactor specificity of the glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate 
dehydrogenase to increase the intracellular production of NADPH at the expense of NADH and thus improve 3HP 
production and reduce formation of glycerol as by‑product. The final strain produced 9.8 ± 0.4 g L−1 3HP with a yield 
of 13 % C‑mol C‑mol−1 glucose after 100 h in carbon‑limited fed‑batch cultivation at pH 5. The 3HP‑producing strain 
was characterized by 13C metabolic flux analysis and by transcriptome analysis, which revealed some unexpected 
consequences of the undertaken metabolic engineering strategy, and based on this data, future metabolic engineer‑
ing directions are proposed.
Conclusions: In this study, S. cerevisiae was engineered for high‑level production of 3HP by increasing the copy num‑
bers of biosynthetic genes and improving flux towards precursors and redox cofactors. This strain represents a good 
platform for further optimization of 3HP production and hence an important step towards potential commercial bio‑
based production of 3HP .

Background
For more than a century, coal, petroleum and natural gas 
have been the primary feedstocks for the chemical indus -
try. However, the fossil resources are diminishing whilst 
demand for chemicals is ever increasing. The environ
-
mental pollution associated with discarding spent chemi-
cals and materials is also gaining focus both on political 
and consumer levels. To address this issue a lot of effort 
is going into developing novel biotechnological strategies 
for producing chemicals from renewable feedstocks [1, 
2], such as sugar cane, starch, biomass hydrolysates, agri
-
cultural waste, etc.
One of the chemicals that have attracted particular 
interest is 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), which can 
serve as a precursor for acrylic acid and its derivatives. 
Additionally 3HP can be polymerized alone or in com
-
positions to obtain biodegradable polyesters. The world 
annual production of acrylic acid and its esters is antici
-
pated to increase to 6 million tons by 2017 (“ Acrylic Acid: 
2014 World Market Outlook and Forecast up to 2018” , 
January 2014). Acrylates find application in a wide range 
of consumer products, e.g. personal care products, adhe
-
sives, coatings and paints, and the annual total market 
size is exceeding USD12 billion. One particularly impor
-
tant application of acrylic acid is for the production of 
superabsorbent polymers, which constitute a significant 
part of baby diapers and incontinence products.
3HP occurs naturally in the metabolism of some ther
-
mophilic archaea as an intermediate of 3HP-dependent 
carbon assimilation cycle. In these organisms, 3HP is 
synthesized from malonyl-CoA via combined action 
of malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR, EC 1.2.1.75) and 
3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.298 
or EC 1.1.1.59)/3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydroge
-
nase (EC 1.1.1.31) or via a bi-functional MCR (EC 
1.2.1.75/1.1.1.298) alone. Recombinant production of 
3HP in Escherichia coli, expressing MCR from Chloro
-
flexus aurantiacus, was first reported by Cargill, Incorpo-
rated [3] and was further developed and demonstrated on 
a pilot scale by OPX Biotechnologies [4]. Production of 
3HP by E. coli is, however, hampered by the requirement 
to produce at pH close to neutral, which results in pro
-
duction of dissociated form of 3HP . It is therefore advan-
tageous to use an acid-tolerant host, such as yeast, as it is 
hereby possible to directly produce the acid form of 3HP . 
We recently described the application of a synthetic path
-
way towards 3HP via β-alanine intermediate in Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae, and the final strain produced 3HP at a 
titer of 13.7 ± 0.3 g L
−1 with a 0.14 ± 0.0 C-mol C-mol−1 
yield on glucose in controlled fed-batch fermentation in 
defined mineral medium at pH 5 [5]. Production of 3HP 
via MCR in baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae was also reported. 
The final strain produced up to 0.5  g  L
−1 in shake flask 
cultivation [6]. Our aim was to examine if it was possi -
ble to further improve the 3HP production via malonyl-
CoA pathway through a rational metabolic engineering 
approach. In the future the malonyl-CoA and β-alanine 
routes towards 3HP could be combined in one strain.
Here we describe the metabolic engineering of S. cer
-
evisiae for high-level production of 3HP via the MCR 
pathway and characterize the production strain by 13C 
flux and transcription analysis.
Results and discussion
Production of 3HP in S. cerevisiae by overexpression 
of acetyl‑CoA carboxylase and MCR
For establishing 3HP production via the malonyl-CoA 
pathway in S. cerevisiae, we decided to co-express the 
gene encoding the bi-functional MCR from C. auran
-
tiacus (CaMCR ) together with the mutated acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (Acc1 S659A,S1157A). Acc1p is involved in the 
conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, and is 
the rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis [7]. The 
double mutations in Acc1p were shown to enhance the 
activity and improve the production of malonyl-CoA-
derived compounds, such as 3HP and fatty acid ethyl 
esters [8]. In this study, we over-expressed CaMCR  and 
mutated ACC1
S659A,S1157A (ACC1**) genes under the con -
trol of P PGK1 and P TEF1 promoters, respectively, in S. cer -
evisiae. We investigated the effect of expression levels of 
CaMCR and ACC1 ** on 3HP production by introducing 
these genes into S. cerevisiae via either a 2μ-based episo -
mal plasmid, a single integration plasmid, or a multiple 
integration plasmid (TY4-plasmid). The TY4-plasmid is 
designed for integrating in multiple copies at long termi
-
nal repeats (LTRs) of retrotransposon of the TY4 family 
[9]. As the transformants derived from either episomal 
or multiple integrative plasmids are expected to have 
different copy numbers of the expression vector, we ran
-
domly screened a minimum of 12 clones to test for 3HP 
production (Fig.  1). The resulting strains were evaluated 
for 3HP production on defined mineral medium contain
-
ing glucose as the sole carbon source (imitating a batch 
process), and on feed-in-time medium for S. cerevisiae 
to simulate 3HP production in a fed-batch process. The 
feed-in-time medium contains higher polysaccharide 
and an enzyme, which degrades the polysaccharide and 
releases glucose. The amount of the enzyme defines the 
rate of glucose release and was chosen here to obtain a 
carbon-limited cultivation. Single integration of CaMCR 
and ACC1
** into the genome led to improvement of 3HP 
titer in both defined mineral and feed-in-time media 
compared to 3HP titer by the strain carrying genes on an 
episomal plasmid. Furthermore, expression of CaMCR  
and ACC1
** in multiple copies via TY4-mediated integra -
tion had a further positive effect and led to a threefold 
Page 3 of 13
Kildegaard et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2016) 15:53 
improvement of 3HP titer, when compared to a S. cere -
visiae strain bearing a single integrative vector with the 
same genes. However, a significant decrease in the maxi -
mum specific growth rate (μ max) was also observed in 
the strain carrying TY4-CaMCR –ACC1** compared to 
the reference strain (Additional file  1: Fig. S1). We then 
used qPCR to analyze the copy number of CaMCR –
ACC1** genes in the strains with TY4-integration and 
found that the inserted genes were present at 3–4 cop -
ies, whereas only 0.5–1 copy of the inserted genes was 
detected in strains carrying an episomal plasmid (in addi-
tion to the inserted ACC1 ** gene, also the native ACC1  
gene was detected, therefore the total copy number of 
ACC1 was always one copy higher than of the CaMCR ). 
These results show that the copy number of CaMCR  and 
ACC1
** had a distinct effect on 3HP production and the 
cellular growth. The copy number of the genes below one 
for the episomal plasmid points to strain instability and 
population heterogeneity. The episomal vector has a large 
size of 17 kb and may be difficult to maintain in yeast.
The benefits of expressing multiple genes from inte
-
grative vectors rather than from episomal vectors has 
been reported earlier [10]. The strains are more stable 
and homogenous expression of all genes within the yeast 
population was observed. Furthermore, optimization of 
the critical enzymes in the pathway by multiple integra
-
tion at TY4 elements has been reported to result in four -
fold increase 3HP production via the β-alanine pathway 
[5]. In this study, the impaired growth in the strain carry
-
ing TY4-CaMCR–ACC1** might be caused by the higher 
activity of Acc1p and MCR, which likely resulted in high 
metabolic burden for the cells. Similar effect of high 
Acc1p activity on the cellular growth has been previously 
reported in both yeast and bacteria [8, 11]. In addition, 
the higher activity of MCR could also result in compe
-
tition with the fatty acid biosynthesis for the substrate, 
malonyl-CoA. A possible solution to this problem could 
be dynamic control of expression of the biosynthetic 
genes, where they are mostly expressed in the production 
phase, but not in the growth phase.
Improvement of 3HP production by increasing the supply 
of acetyl‑CoA precursor
It was previously shown that overexpression of acetyl-
CoA synthase derived from Salmonella enterica (SEac -
sL641P) and of the native aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD6) 
enhanced the flux towards acetyl-CoA and resulted in 
higher isoprenoids [12] or 3HP concentration [6]. For 
another acetyl-CoA-derived product (butanol), the titer 
was improved by overexpression of ALD6, SEacs and 
PDC1 [13]. We therefore tested the effect of overexpress
-
ing genes ALD6, SEacsL641P and PDC1  in combination 
with multiple integration of CaMCR  and ACC1** on 3HP 
production. First, we constructed two chassis strains 
harboring an additional copy of either ALD6-SEacs
L641P 
under the control of P PGK1 and P TEF1 promoters, respec -
tively, or of ALD6-SEacsL641P in combination with PDC1 
under the control of P TEF1. These resulting strains were 
further transformed with pTY4-CaMCR –ACC1**. Over -
expression of ALD6-SEacsL641P improved the 3HP titer by 
20 %, while combined overexpression of ALD6-SEacsL641P 
and PDC1 increased the titer by 80  % in both defined 
mineral and feed-in-time media (Fig.  2). Furthermore, 
gene copy number of CaMCR–ACC1** in different strains 
was determined by qPCR, and we detected similar copies 
of both genes (3–4 copies) in all the constructed strains, 
which is in consistent with the copy number observed 
in strain carrying TY4-CaMCR –ACC1
** from the previ -
ous section. These results clearly show that enhancing 
the availability of intracellular acetyl-CoA had additive 
effects on 3HP production when combined with multiple 
copies of the CaMCR and ACC1
**.

Improvement of 3HP production by engineering the redox 
metabolism
CaMCR catalyzed reduction of malonyl-CoA to 3HP 
requires two NADPH. Therefore, the engineered pathway 
towards 3HP has a substantial need for this redox equiva-
lent. Consequently, a yeast host with elevated NADPH 
availability is preferred. Different approaches have previ
-
ously been reported to improve the supply of NADPH in 
S. cerevisiae. Heterologous expression of non-phospho
-
rylating NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPN, EC 1.2.1.9) has been shown to 
improve bioethanol and 3HP production and minimize 
glycerol synthesis [6, 14, 15]. Another approach was het
-
erologous expression of NADP-dependent glyceralde -
hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP-GAPDH, EC 
1.2.1.13) from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlGAPDH ), applied 
to improve xylose fermentation [13]. In addition, replac
-
ing the native E. coli NAD-GAPDH with NADP-GAPDH 
from Clostridium acetobutylicum resulted in significant 
improvements in lycopene and epsilon-caprolactone pro
-
ductivities [16]. In this study, we decided to overexpress 
a NADP-GAPDH gene from C. acetobutylicum 
(CaGAPDH) as this enzyme has higher affinity to NADP 
than KlGAPDH [16]. Verho and coworkers reported that 
KlGAPDH has equal kinetics for both NADP and NAD 
[17]. Additionally, we tried to reduce the potential futile 
cycle between the endogenous GAPDH and the intro
-
duced GAPDH by lowering the level of endogenous 
GAPDH activity. The NADP-dependent GAPDH was 
expressed in yeast strains, in which one, two or three of 
the endogenous NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phos
-
phate dehydrogenase genes TDH1, TDH2 or TDH3 were 
deleted and/or exchanged with the coding sequence of 
GAPDH. By exchanging the coding sequence, we ensured 
that the introduced GAPDH had the same expression 
profile as the endogenous NAD-dependent GAPDH. 
Eight different combinations were made according to 
Additional file 1: Table S3. Into each of these eight strains 
and the reference strain we integrated ALD6, SEac

sL641P, PDC1, and TY4-CaMCR –ACC1**. In both tested 
media, there was significant increase in 3HP titer for the 
strains, in which TDH3 was replaced with CaGAPDH

(tdh3::CaGAPDH). The effects of additional modifi -
cations to this replacement were minor (Fig.  3a). The 
strains without cofactor engineering ‘TDH3’ produced 
1.2 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.2 g L−1 3HP in defined mineral and 
feed-in-time media, respectively. The ‘tdh3::CaGAPDH’ 
strains gave 1.8 ± 0.2 and 3.6  ± 0.2 g L−1 3HP in defined 
mineral and feed-in-time media, respectively. Further -
more, the ratio between 3HP and glycerol was nearly 
twofold higher for the ‘tdh3::CaGAPDH’ strains grown 
in defined mineral medium compared to the strain with
-
out cofactor engineering ‘TDH3’ (Additional file  1: Fig. 
S2). On the other hand, the change in 3HP/glycerol was 
less pronounced when the strains were cultivated in 
feed-in-time medium. This was also expected because 
under carbon-limited conditions more carbon enters 
the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, effectively result
-
ing in higher NADPH production [18]. The best isolates 
among the strains without cofactor engineering ‘TDH3’ 
and ‘tdh3::CaGAPDH’ strains were named ST3580 and 
ST687, respectively. The intracellular concentrations of 
redox cofactors in ST3580, ST687 and non-producing 
strain (ST1) were further investigated. The 3HP-pro
-
ducing strain ST3580 strain had slightly lower NADPH/
NADP ratio than the non-producing strain. By engi
-
neering the NADPH cofactor in strain ST687, the ratio 
between NADPH and NADP was significantly increased 
(Fig.  3b; Additional file  1: Fig. S3). Interestingly, the 
NADH/NAD ratio increased as well, which may explain 
why this strategy did not eliminate glycerol production. We 
also measured the μ
max of the three tested strains. ST687 
had the lowest μmax of 0.12  h−1, whereas μmax of 0.16  h−1 
was observed in ST3580. The decrease in the specific 
growth rate in Δtdh3 strain was also observed earlier [19].
Production of 3HP in controlled fed‑batch fermentation
The best 3HP-producing yeast strain ST687 was cultivated 
under two different fermentation conditions: carbon-
limited fed-batch (C) and nitrogen- and carbon-limited

fed-batch (N/C). The results are summarized in Table  1, 
Fig. 4 and in Additional file  1: Fig. S4. ST687 strain pro -
duced up to 6.9 ± 1.0 and 9.8 ± 0.4 g L−1 3HP in N/C-lim-
ited and C-limited fed-batch fermentations, respectively. 
This is a significant increase over the 3HP concentrations 
via malonyl-CoA pathway in S. cerevisiae reported earlier 
[6]. The 3HP/glycerol ratio observed in the C-limited fed-
batch cultivations was similar to that observed in microti
-
ter plate cultivations with feed-in-time medium described 
above. In N/C-limited fed-batch, the specific yield of 3HP 
and 3HP/glycerol ratio were slightly higher than under 
C-limitation. The final titer however was lower due to the 
low biomass concentration. Furthermore, higher acetate 
accumulation was also observed. Nitrogen limitation 
has been reported to result in higher lipid accumulation, 
which requires acetyl-CoA and NADPH [20]. Increased 
production of acetyl-CoA and NADPH under nitrogen 
limitation could explain the increased 3HP and acetate 
production and improved 3HP/glycerol ratio.
Transcriptome analysis of 3HP‑producing S. cerevisiae 
strain
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has been used to 
explore the cellular response to different perturbations, 
e.g. altered growth conditions or genetic changes. In this 
study, we performed transcriptome analysis using RNA 
sequencing on the two S. cerevisiae strains, the non-
producing strain ST1 and the best 3HP-producing strain 
ST687, in order to explore the change in gene expression 
profile in response to the engineered 3HP production. 
When comparing the ST1 and ST687 strains, 474 genes 
with significant changed mRNA levels (q  ≤  0.05) were 
identified. Among these 474 genes, 326 genes showed 
a change of more than twofold (Additional file  2: Table 
S6). Apart from expected genes that were purposely 
over-expressed in ST687 (CaMCR , ACC1, PDC1, ALD6, 
ACS, CaGAPDH), several genes involved in the PP path
-
way ( SOL3, GND1, TKL1, TAL1) and tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle (MPC2, IDH1, IDH2, ACO1, ACO2) were 
up-regulated (Fig.  5). By contrast, the expression of 
ZWF1, the rate limiting reaction in the entire PP path -
way, was not affected by redox perturbations. Increased 
expression of PP pathway genes and of isocitrate dehy
-
drogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 may lead to improved 
NADPH availability in the cytosol for 3HP produc
-
tion. The upregulation of several PP pathway genes (i.e., 
SOL3, GND1, TKL1, TAL1) in response to an increase in 
NADPH demand has previously been reported [21]. In 
addition, a handful of genes related to redox metabolism 
were either down-regulated (FDH1, NDE2, OYE2, OYE3, 
ADH5) or up-regulated (GPD2, GSH1, BNA4). We pro
-
pose that the changes in the expression of genes involved 
in the redox metabolism are due to the NADPH demand 
for 3HP biosynthesis. Additionally, some genes in the gly
-
colytic pathway (HXK1, HXK2) were also up-regulated in 
ST687. Furthermore, several genes belonging to biotin 
biosynthesis/biotin related proteins were up-regulated 
such as BIO3, BIO4, BIO5 and PET8. This could be due to 
overexpression of a gene encoding for Acc1p, which uses 
biotin as cofactor. Significant changes in transcription of

genes related to amino acid synthesis and transport were 
also observed (up-regulated: HOM3 , SER3, GLN1; and 
down-regulated: ADY2, ALT2, BAP3, VBA5, GNP1 and 
AGP1). The increase in the expression of genes involved 
in amino acid synthesis, particularly those involved in the 
NADPH-consuming methionine and lysine pathway and 
serine biosynthesis, might be due to an indirect response 
to the higher NADPH availability [21].
13C Metabolic flux analysis of 3HP producing S. 
cerevisiae
Metabolic flux analysis combined with genome-scale 
modeling is a powerful tool for studying the global 
response of the cellular metabolism to environmental 
or genetic changes and for identifying the mechanisms 
involved in re-routing the metabolic fluxes. In this study, 
we performed 
13C metabolic flux analysis on the two 
S. cerevisiae strains, non-producing strain (ST1) and 
the best 3HP-producing strain (ST687), to gain a bet
-
ter understanding of the influence of 3HP biosynthesis 
on the flux distribution. Both strains were cultivated in 
carbon-limited chemostats at 0.04 h
−1 either with 100 % 
1-13C labeled glucose or a mixture of 20 % U–13C-labelled 
and 80  % natural-labelled glucose. After 4–5 retention 
times, the steady-state culture was harvested and the 
labelling was analyzed by GC–MS and the fluxes were 
calculated using a central carbon model in 
13C flux soft -
ware [22] (redox balance was not accounted for in the 
model, the calculations were made only based on carbon-
balance and labelling pattern). The flux values obtained 
from 
13C analysis were used as constraints for a genome-
scale model, where redox balance was enforced and the 
residual fluxes were calculated. The fluxes in the central 
carbon metabolism in the ST687 and ST1 strains are pre
-
sented in Fig.  5 and Additional file  3: Table S7. Notably, 
the biomass yield on glucose was significantly lower for 
the producing strain (0.40  g DW  g glucose
−1) in com -
parison to 0.50 in ST1 strain. The decrease cannot be 
accounted for by 3HP flux alone (0.02 g 3HP g glucose
−1), 
and hence there must also be more carbon dioxide pro -
duced by the ST687. The flux through the PP pathway 
and TCA cycle was increased by correspondingly 23 and 
12 % in the ST687 strain, which is consistent with tran
-
scriptional analysis showing up-regulation of several 
genes in the PP and TCA pathways in the ST687 strain.
The flux from acetate into acetyl-CoA was increased in 
ST687, which might be due to a combination of overex
-
pression of ACS  and down-regulation of acetate trans -
porter ADY2, whereas higher acetate secretion was 
observed in the ST1 strain. In ST687, most of the acetate 
was converted into 3HP and biomass. On the other hand, 
the flux from pyruvate into acetate dropped to nearly 
half in ST687 even though the corresponding genes were 
overexpressed.
The combined data on physiological characterization, 
transcriptome and flux distribution revealed several 
unexpected consequences of the undertaken metabolic 
engineering strategies. Firstly, in spite of our attempts 
to provide more NADPH by exchanging a native NAD-
dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
with a heterologous NADP-dependent version, the redox 
imbalance has not been completely resolved. Strain 
ST687 continued to produce glycerol in cohort with 3HP 
production. Even more surprisingly, the two major path
-
ways for NADPH regeneration, PP pathway and isocitrate 
dehydrogenases, were transcriptionally upregulated and 
carried higher flux in the engineered strain. The ST687 
strain had increased ratios of NADPH/NADP , but also 
of NADH/NAD. These findings underline the complex
-
ity and high connectivity of the redox metabolism and 
the difficulties associated with engineering of the redox 
metabolism. Secondly, we found that the flux from pyru
-
vate towards acetate actually dropped 2.5-fold, against 
expectations. The transcriptome data showed that all 
the genes in the pyruvate dehydrogenase by-pass path
-
way were highly upregulated and the flux from acetate to 
acetyl-CoA increased, but there was obviously a limita
-
tion in pyruvate conversion into acetate.
These findings have implications both on the direction 
of the next metabolic engineering efforts and on the pro -
cess considerations. The chosen carbon-limited feeding 
strategy limits the overflow metabolism and hence leads 
to very low flux to acetate. If a batch-type fermentation 
mode is chosen instead, then a significant part of carbon

will be lost to ethanol and hence ethanol formation must 
be prevented. This can be achieved either by deletion of 
the numerous native alcohol dehydrogenases [23] or by 
deletion of pyruvate decarboxylases [24], both very chal
-
lenging strategies, the latter would also require installing 
a different pathway for cytosolic acetyl-CoA supply for 
3HP , e.g. a recently described cytosolic pyruvate dehy
-
drogenase complex [25]. On the other hand, using batch 
cultivation would lead to low flux via PP pathway, which 
may reduce the supply of NADPH cofactor for 3HP pro
-
duction. To avoid glycerol formation, deletion of GPD2 
can be considered [26], however if the redox imbalance 
is not restored, the strain will suffer from reduced growth 
rate and viability and will have decreased tolerance to 
osmotic stress. For further metabolic engineering, many 
factors must be taken into consideration and prefer
-
ably multiple potential strategies should be investigated. 
Dynamic regulation of 3HP expression and growth-
essential genes may allow decoupling the growth and 
production phases and hence lead to higher product titer, 
rate and yield.
Our study yet again demonstrated that in strain engi
-
neering it is not sufficient to look at the resulting prod -
uct titers, but one needs more in-depth characterization 
of the cellular physiology and cellular components and 
fluxes in order to follow and push forward the strain 
development.
Conclusions
Here we engineered and optimized 3HP production in S. 
cerevisiae via the malonyl-CoA pathway. Integration of 
multiple copies of biosynthetic genes, overexpression of 
precursor supply genes, and engineering the redox cofac
-
tor all improved the 3HP production, resulting in a strain 
able to produce 3HP at a titer of 9.8  ± 0.4 g L
−1 with a 
yield of 13 % C-mol C-mol −1 glucose after 100 h at pH 5 
in C-limited fed-batch cultivation. This strain represents 
a platform for further optimization of 3HP production 
and hence an important step towards potential commer
-
cial, bio-based production of 3HP .
Methods
Strains and maintenance
Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK strains were obtained 
from Peter Kötter (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University 
Frankfurt, Germany). Recombinant yeast strains were 
selected on synthetic drop-out agar plates (Sigma–
Aldrich) at 30 °C. Cultivation of the recombinant strains 
was performed in defined mineral medium or synthetic 
fed-batch medium Sc.syn-1000 (M2P labs GmbH, Ger
-
many). The defined mineral medium contained per liter: 
7.5 g (NH
4)2SO4, 14.4 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 22 g 
dextrose, 2 mL trace metals solution, and 1 mL vitamins. 
The salts were dissolved in water, pH was adjusted to 6 
and the solution was autoclaved. Glucose solution was 
sterilized separately. Glucose solution and vitamins solu
-
tion were added to the autoclaved salts solution. The trace 
metals solution contained per liter: 4.5  g CaCl
2·2H2O, 
4.5  g ZnSO 4·7H2O, 3  g FeSO 4·7H2O, 1  g H 3BO3, 1  g 
MnCl2·4H2O, 0.4  g Na 2MoO4·2H2O, 0.3  g CoCl 2·6H2O, 
0.1  g CuSO4·5H2O, 0.1  g KI, and 15  g EDTA. The trace 
metals solution was prepared by dissolving all the com -
ponents except EDTA in 900 mL ultra-pure water at pH 
6. The solution was then gently heated and EDTA was 
added. In the end, the pH was adjusted to 4, and the solu
-
tion volume was adjusted to 1 L and autoclaved (121 °C 
in 20 min). This solution was stored at 4 °C. The vitamins 
solution had per liter: 50 mg biotin, 200 mg p-aminoben
-
zoic acid, 1 g nicotinic acid, 1 g Ca-pantotenate, 1 g pyri -
doxine–HCl, 1  g thiamine–HCl, and 25  g myo-inositol. 
Biotin was dissolved in 20 mL 0.1 M NaOH and 900 mL 
water is added. pH was adjusted to 6.5 with HCl and the 
rest of the vitamins was added. pH was re-adjusted to 6.5 
just before and after adding m-inositol. The final volume 
was adjusted to 1 L and sterile-filtered before storage at 
4 °C [10].
The chemicals were obtained, if not indicated other
-
wise, from Sigma–Aldrich. The 3-hydroxypropionic was 
purchased from Tokyo Chemicals Industry Co. (TCI).
Escherichia coli strains were cultivated on Luria–Ber
-
tani (LB) medium with appropriate antibiotic selection at 
37 °C. E. coli transformants were selected on LB medium 
containing 100 µg mL
−1 ampicillin.
Plasmids construction
The primers, biobricks and plasmids used in this study 
are listed in Additional file  1: Tables S1, S2 and S3. The 
biobricks were assembled into episomal, integrative or 
multiple integrative plasmids using USER cloning [10]. 
DNA manipulations in E. coli were carried out according 
to standard procedures. The clones with correct inserts 
were identified by colony PCR and the plasmids were iso
-
lated from overnight E. coli cultures and confirmed by 
sequencing.
Strains construction
All strains used in this study are listed in Additional file 1: 
Table S4. The integrative plasmids were Not I-linearized 
and transformed into S. cerevisiae cells using the lith -
ium acetate transformation protocol [27]. The cells were 
selected on synthetic drop-out medium. The tdh -strains 
were constructed sequentially as indicated in the Addi
-
tional file 1: Table S4. The linear PCR fragments used for 
transformation were constructed by combining USER, 
T4 ligation and PCR amplification. The final transforma
-
tion fragments were made from 2 to 3 individual PCR 
Page 10 of 13Kildegaard et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2016) 15:53 
fragments with matching USER tails, which were mixed 
with USER enzyme and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C fol-
lowed by 20 min at 25 °C. After USER reaction T4 ligase 
was added and the mix was incubated for 5 min at room 
temperature. One micro-litre of this ligation mix was 
used as template for the final PCR reaction in order to 
amplify the whole assembled DNA fragment. The frag
-
ments were purified from gel and used for yeast transfor -
mation (100–300 ng per transformation).
All strains were verified by PCR using insert-specific 
oligos in combination with oligos specific to the regions 
outside the different recombination sites. The CreA-
loxP-mediated selection marker loop-out was done as 
described previously [10]. The elimination of the selec
-
tion marker was verified by PCR in addition to pheno -
typic tests.
Cultivation in microtiter plates
At least six single colonies originating from independent 
transformants were inoculated in 0.5 mL synthetic drop-
out liquid medium without uracil, histidine, and leucine 
(SC-ura-his-leu) in a 96-deep well microtiter plate with 
air-penetrable lid (EnzyScreen, NL). The plates were 
incubated at 30 °C with 250 rpm agitation at 5 cm orbit 
cast overnight. 50 µL of the overnight cultures were used 
to inoculate 0.5 mL defined mineral medium or synthetic 
fed-batch medium (feed-in-time medium), in a 96-deep 
well plate. Fermentation was carried out for 72 h at the 
same conditions as above.
At the end of the cultivation OD
600 was measured as 
previously described [5]. The culture broth was spun 
down and the supernatant analyzed for metabolites con
-
centration using HPLC. The variation in 3HP titer did not 
exceed 10 % between different batches of the same strain.
Controlled fermentations
ST687 glycerol stock (0.3 mL) was inoculated in 150 mL 
SC-ura-his-leu medium in a 250-mL baffled shake flask 
and propagated at 30 °C with 250 rpm agitation for about 
24  h. The culture was concentrated down to 50  mL by 
centrifugation at 4000× rpm for 2 min and used to inoc
-
ulate 0.5 L defined mineral medium in 1 L-Sartorius reac-
tor. Culture media and growth conditions were the same 
as described before [5]. The agitation rate was 800 rpm, 
the temperature was 30  °C, aeration was 1  L  min
−1 air 
and pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition 
of 2  N NaOH. For fed-batch cultivations, the feed was 
started after the glucose was exhausted. For C-limited 
fed-batch cultivation, the feed contained per liter: 45  g 
(NH
4)2SO4, 18 g KH 2PO4, 3 g MgSO4·7H2O, 12 mL trace 
metals solution, 6 mL vitamins solution, 0.6 mL antifoam 
A, and 176  g dextrose. Dextrose was autoclaved sepa
-
rately, vitamins solution was sterile filtered and added 
to the feed after autoclavation. The initial feed rate was 
set to 5 g h
−1 and 72 h after the feed start it was further 
increased to 15  g  h −1. The total feed volume used per 
reactor was 0.5  L. For N/C-limited fed-batch cultiva -
tion, the feed contained per liter: 200 g dextrose as well 
as 6 mL trace metals solution and 3 mL vitamin solution. 
During the first 14 h of the feeding phase a feed rate of 
1 g h
−1 was applied, after that the feed rate was reduced 
to 0.6  g  h−1. The reactors were sampled twice a day to 
measure biomass dry weight and metabolites. For metab-
olites analysis the sample was immediately centrifuged 
and the supernatant was stored at −20  °C until HPLC 
analysis. Continuous cultivation for transcriptome anal
-
ysis was performed using mineral medium as described 
before [10], but 3 g L
−1 of KH 2PO4 was used instead of 
14.4  g  L−1. After glucose was exhausted, the feed was 
started at the dilution rate of 0.04 h −1. Once the steady-
state has been established, the cultivation was allowed to 
proceed for three residence times and samples for metab
-
olites analysis and transcriptome were withdrawn. The 
feed medium was the same for both batch and continu
-
ous phases.
Analysis of metabolites and cell dry weight
Cell growth was determined by measuring the absorb -
ance at 600  nm wavelength. The extracellular metabo -
lites were quantified by HPLC as previously described 
[5]. Glucose, glycerol and ethanol were detected using a 
RI-101 Refractive Index Detector (Dionex). 3HP , pyru
-
vate, succinate and acetate were detected with a DAD-
3000 diode array detector at 210 nm (Dionex).
qPCR analysis
The copy numbers of CaMCR  and ACC1 ** genes in the 
recombinant yeast strains overexpressing these genes 
were determined by qPCR. Genomic DNA from three 
isolates from each strain was isolated using ZR Fungal/
Bacterial DNA MiniPrepTM kit (Zymo Reasearch Cor
-
poration) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda -
tion. qPCR analysis of gDNA was carried out in triplicate 
using Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR
® Green QPCR Master 
Mix (Agilent Technologies) on a Stratagene Mx3005P 
(Agilent Technologies). The thermal cycling conditions 
were 95 °C, 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s 
and 60 °C for 22 s, then 1 cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C 
for 30  min, and 95  °C for 30  s. The gene copy numbers 
were measured relative to that of a housekeeping gene 
(ALG9). Primers used for qPCR are listed in Additional 
file 1: Table S1.
Intracellular redox cofactors analysis
The strains were cultivated in 5 mL of SC-ura-his-leu in 
15-mL plastic tubes at 30 °C with 250 rpm overnight. The 
Page 11 of 13
Kildegaard et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2016) 15:53 
overnight cultures were used to inoculate 50  mL min -
eral medium in 250 mL shake flasks to an initial OD of 
0.05. For ST687 strain, an initial OD 600 of 0.1 was used 
due to slow growth. The shake flasks were incubated at 
30 °C with 250 rpm. After 24 h of incubation, the samples 
were withdrawn and quenched in 5 ml of cold methanol 
(−40  °C). The sample volume withdrawn was adjusted 
to give OD
600 of 15 that is required for the analysis. The 
sample volume did not exceed 2  mL for any samples. 
The samples were immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm, 
for 5 min. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was 
removed and the cell pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen 
and stored at −80 °C before the analysis. All cultivations 
were done in biological triplicates. Each shake flask was 
sampled in five technical replicates. Intracellular metabo
-
lites were extracted by using boiling ethanol method and 
redox cofactors were analyzed by LC–MS/MS (for details 
on sample preparation and LC/MS analysis see Addi
-
tional file 1: Supplementary methods).
13C-labelling experiments and analytical procedure 
(GC–MS)
In order to quantify the intracellular fluxes, a combina -
tion of metabolite balancing and isotope labeling experi -
ments were applied for the reference and the engineered 
3HP-producing strain.
Continuous cultivations were performed in mini-biore
-
actors with a working volume of 10  mL. The setup was 
based on the mini-scale reactor system described by [28]. 
Hungate tubes (16 mm  × 125 mm, Dunnlab, Germany) 
with a butyl rubber septum were used as culture vessels. 
All tubes were fixed in a tempered water bath at 30  °C. 
Medium feed and fermentation broth efflux was real
-
ized by a multichannel peristaltic pump (IPC 12 Ismatec, 
Wertheim, Germany). To minimize the risk of back-con
-
tamination a fused silica capillary (ID 100 µm Optronis, 
Kehl, Germany) was used for feed supply. The harvest 
pump was connected to a needle (ID 0.8 mm, L 120 mm), 
which was positioned at the corresponding height of 
10  mL to maintain a constant liquid volume. The efflux 
rate was set to 0.5 mL h
−1 and always exceeded the feed 
rate. A third multichannel pump (Ecoline VC-MS/CA8-6 
Ismatec, Wertheim, Germany) actively pumped humidi
-
fied air into the mini-reactors via a submerged needle (ID 
1  mm, L 200  mm). The aeration rate was set to 2  vvm. 
Off-gas was directed via a short needle (ID 1.2  mm, L 
80  mm) to an O
2/CO2 gas analyzer (BlueInOne, BlueS -
ens, Herten, Germany). Additional mixing of the cul -
ture liquid was realized with magnetic stirrer discs at 
900  rpm. A fourth needle (ID 0.8  mm, L 120  mm) was 
used as sampling port.
The cultivation was started with an initial batch fer
-
mentation in minimal medium (pH 5, buffered with 
100  mM potassium hydrogen phthalate) with 10  g  L −1 
glucose. After cells reached stationary phase, indicated 
by the drop of the off-gas CO
2 signal, feed and harvest 
pumps were started and the fermentation was switched 
to continuous mode. The dilution rate was set to 0.04 h
−1 
and the supplied feed medium was equal to the batch 
medium. For 
13C labeling experiments 100  % 1- 13C 
labeled glucose (99  % purity, Euriso-Top GmbH, Saar -
brücken, Germany) or a mixture of 20  % (n/n) U– 13C 
glucose (99  % purity, Euriso-Top GmbH, Saarbrücken, 
Germany) and 80 % (n/n) naturally labeled glucose were 
used. Metabolic steady-state conditions were checked by 
stability of the CO
2 and O2 signals in the off-gas and opti-
cal density measurements. Samples for HPLC measure -
ments were taken for quantification of residual glucose, 
3HP and metabolic byproducts. After 4–5 residence 
times, samples of 0.3 mg CDW were taken from the cul
-
ture broth for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry 
(GC–MS) analysis of proteinogenic amino acids. The cells 
were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with ster
-
ile water and hydrolyzed in 500 mL 6 M HCl at 105 °C for 
6 h. The hydrolysate was dried in a heating block at 85 °C. 
The free amino acids were resuspended in 30 µL acetoni
-
trile and 30  µL N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-
trifluoroacetamide (MBDSTFA, CS–Chromatographie 
Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) for 1 h at 85 °C. 
The samples were cooled down to room temperature and 
analyzed immediately by GC–MS.
Gas chromatographic separation was performed on 
a Thermo Scientific (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA) Trace GC Ultra equipped with a Thermo Scientific 
AS 3000 autosampler and a Thermo Scientific (Thermo 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) TraceGOLD TG-5SilMS 
capillary column (length, 30 m; inner diameter, 0.25 mm; 
film thickness, 0.25 µm). Separation of amino acids was 
performed at a constant flow rate of 1 mL helium min
−1. 
A sample volume of 1 µL was injected into a split/splitless 
injector at 270 °C with a split ratio of 1:15. The tempera
-
ture of the GC oven was kept constant for 1 min at 140 °C 
and afterwards increased with a gradient of 10 °C min
−1 
to 310 °C and again kept constant for 1 min. Mass spec -
trometry analysis was performed on a Thermo Scien -
tific (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) ISQ single 
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The temperatures of the 
transfer line and the ion source were set to 280 °C. Ioni
-
zation was performed by electron impact (EI) ionization 
at 70 eV. GC–MS raw data were analyzed with Xcalibur.
13C-constrained flux analysis
FiatFlux [22] was used to calculate metabolic flux ratios 
and net intracellular flux distributions as described 
in [29, 30]. The stoichiometric model of S. cerevisiae’s 
central carbon metabolism, described in [29], was 
Page 12 of 13Kildegaard et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2016) 15:53 
extended with either of the 3HP biosynthesis pathways 
and constrained with the specific extracellular rates of 
biomass production (µ), glucose uptake rate, 3HP syn
-
thesis rate, and formation of the metabolic byproducts 
glycerol, acetate and pyruvate. The network was fur
-
ther constrained with linear equations derived from 
the eight metabolic flux ratios: fraction of cytosolic 
oxaloacetate originating from cytosolic pyruvate, frac
-
tion of mitochondrial oxaloacetate derived through 
anaplerosis, fraction of phosphoenolpyruvate origi
-
nating from cytosolic oxaloacetate, fraction of serine 
derived through glycolysis, upper and lower bounds of 
mitochondrial pyruvate derived through malic enzyme, 
contribution of glycine to serine biosynthesis, and con
-
tribution of serine to glycine biosynthesis. Mass bal -
ances for CO 2, O2, ATP and NADPH were not used for 
flux calculation.
Transcriptome analysis
Samples for transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) were 
taken after three residence times of the steady state con
-
tinuous cultivation in 1L-bioreactors. Sampling pro -
cedure and total RNA extraction were performed as 
described before [31].
The sequencing libraries were prepared in triplicates 
using a TruSeq Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San 
Diego CA) and were pooled together prior to sequencing. 
An average cDNA library size was determined using the 
Agilent DNA 1000 kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 
Libraries were normalized and pooled in 10 mM Tris–Cl, 
pH 8.0, plus 0.05 % Tween 20 to the final concentration 
of 10 nM. Denaturated in 0.2 N NaOH, 10 pm pool of 6 
libraries in 600 μL ice-cold HT1 buffer was loaded onto 
the flow cell provided in the MiSeq Reagent kit v2 300 
cycles and sequenced on a MiSeq
® (Illumina Inc., San 
Diego CA) platform with a paired-end protocol and read 
lengths of 151 nucleotides.
TopHat (2.0.13) and Cufflinks (2.2.1) suite was used for 
RNAseq-based differential gene expression analysis as 
described by Trapnell et al. 2012 [32]. Reference genome 
and annotations for CEN.PK113-7D strain were retrieved 
from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).
Mathematical modeling and genome scale flux analysis
Fluxes were determined through computer assisted met -
abolic engineering and optimization (CAMEO) toolbox 
(doi: 10.5281/zenodo.18400) using parsimonious flux bal
-
ance analysis (pFBA). A modified iTO977 yeast model 
[33] was used, for which the fluxes were bound to the 
13C-determined flux ranges where available (for details 
on the modifications see Additional file 1: Supplementary 
methods). Escher [34] was used to make flux map figures.
