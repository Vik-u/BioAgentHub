Abstract
Poly(3-hydroxypropion ate) (P3HP) is a thermoplasti c with great compostabilit y and biocom-
patibility, and can be produced through several biosynthet ic pathways, in which the glycerol
pathway achieved the highest P3HP production. However, exogenous supply of vitamin B
12
was required to maintain the activity of glycerol dehydratase, resulting in high production
cost. To avoid the addition of VB
12
, we have previously constructed a P3HP biosynthet ic
route with β-alanine as intermediate, and the present study aimed to improve the P3HP pro-
duction of this pathway. L-aspartate decarboxylase PanD was found to be the rate-limiting
enzyme in the β-alanine pathway firstly. To improve the pathway efficiency, PanD was
screened from four different sources (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomon as fluor-
escens, and Corynebacterium glutamicum). And PanD from C. glutamicum was found to
have the highest activity, the P3HP production was improved in flask cultivation with this
enzyme. To further improve the production, the host strain was screened and the culture
condition was optimized. Under optimal conditions, production and content of P3HP
reached to 10.2 g/L and 39.1% (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) in an aerobic fed-batch fermentation.
To date, this is the highest P3HP production without VB

Introduction
Poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) is a promising polymer with high rigidity, ductility, and
exceptional tensile strength in drawn films, and can be synthesized chemically by ring open-
ing polymerization of β-propiolactone [1]. However, the chemical synthesis is not suitable
for industrial scale production of P3HP because β-propiolactone is a human carcinogen.
As 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) is not a common metabolite in most organisms, biosynthesis
of 3HP-containing polymers was usually based on structurally-related precursors, such as

3HP and acrylic acid [1], whereas the precursors are generally expensive and toxic to the
cells. So P3HP biosynthesis from inexpensive carbon sources has attracted much more inter-
est recently.
In our previous study, three strategies have been adopted for P3HP biosynthesis. One path-
way starts from malonyl-CoA, which is reduced to free 3HP by the malonyl-CoA reductase
(MCR) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus. Unfortunately, our recombinant Escherichia coli strain
accumulated only 13 mg/L P3HP when using glucose as sole carbon source [2]. In the second
strategy, glycerol is converted into 3-hydroxypropionaldehyd e by glycerol dehydratase from
Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by CoA ligation with propionaldehyde dehydrogenase from
Salmonella typhimurium, and polymerization with polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from
Cupriavidus necator. Though 10.1 g/L P3HP was produced from glycerol in fed-batch fermen-
tation, exogenous supply of vitamin B
12
was required to maintain the activity of glycerol dehy-
dratase, which resulted in high production cost [3].
Then a new pathway employing β-alanine as an intermediate was constructed (Fig 1) [4]. In
this pathway, L-aspartate produced from aspartate biosynthesis pathway was converted into β-
alanine using L-aspartate-α-decarboxylase (PanD) from Escherichia coli, β-alanine was con-
verted into malonate semialdehyde by β-alanine-pyruvate transaminase of Pseudomonas
putida, and then malonate semialdehyde was reduced by 3-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase from
E. coli to 3-HP as precursor of P3HP. Although this pathway has some advantages such as
being redox neutral and does not require VB
12
, the P3HP production and content are relatively
lower than other pathways. High cost and low production seriously restricted the industrializa-
tion of P3HP. In previous study, it was noticed that supplement of β-alanine could significantly
improve the P3HP production, indicating that the P3HP yield of β-alanine pathway is limited
by two possible reasons: low activity of PanD or low intracellular L-aspartate concentration.
Further study should be done to verify the real cause and improve the P3HP production.
This study was aimed to find the rate-limiting step of the new P3HP pathway and improve
the production for industrial scale. Based on the results, firstly we figured out that insufficient
β-alanine restricts the P3HP biosynthesis and poor PanD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the β-
alanine pathway. Through enzyme screening, PanD from Corynebacteria glutamicum was
proved to have higher enzyme activity and could improve the P3HP production dramatically.
Under optimal conditions, the resultant E. coli strain produced 0.98 g/L and 10.2 g/L P3HP in

taining 100ml medium at 37˚C in an orbital incubator and shaken at 200 rpm with an orbit
diameter of 26 mm. The cells were induced with 0.05mM IPTG at OD
600
~ 0.6 unless specified.
The precursors (β-alanine and L-aspartate) and organic nitrogen sources (tryptone, soy
peptone, yeast extract and beef extract) were added as indicated in the text. The P3HP was
extracted from the lyophilized cells with hot chloroform as described [7]. All shake-flask exper-
iments were performed in triplicate.
Fed-batch fermentation
Fed-batch fermentation were carried out in a Biostat B plus MO5L fermentor (Sartorius Ste-
dim Biotech GmbH, Germany) under the optimal conditions obtained through shake flask
experiments. 3 g/L glucose and 20 g/L glycerol was used as initial carbon sources. After the ini-
tial carbon sources were nearly exhausted, fed-batch mode was commenced by feeding a solu-
tion containing 10M glycerol. Ammonia (25% in water) was added automatically to control
the pH at 7.0. The dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained at 20% saturation. At
OD
600
of 10, the cells were induced by adding 0.05mM IPTG. IPTG and antibiotics were
added every 24h during 72h fermentation.
SDS-PAGE analysis and aspartate decarboxylase activity assay
The strain Q2153, Q2542, Q2543, Q2544 and E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown in minimal
medium at 37˚C and induced by 0.05 mM IPTG at 30˚C. The cells were harvested by centrifu-
gation 3h after induction and lysed by sonication. The whole-cell lysate was used for SDS-
PAGE. Proteins were separated in 12% acrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie brilliant
blue R250. L-Aspartate-decarboxylase (PanD) activity was assayed by evaluating the conver-
sion of aspartate to β-alanine as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis [8].
P3HP extraction and characterization
After all the fermentation process, the obtained cells were harvested by centrifugation and
washed with distilled water. The cell pellets were lyophilized and the CDW was gravimetrically
determined. The P3HP was extracted from the lyophilized cells with hot chloroform in a soxh-
let apparatus and precipitated by the ice cold absolute ethanol as described [7]. The structure
of the obtained P3HP was confirmed by NMR analysis using the Advanced III 600 NMR spec-
trometer (Bruker, Switzerland) as described in our previous study [9]. P3HP content was cal-
culated using the ratio of P3HP weight to cell dry weight.

Results and discussion
Verification of the rate-limiting step in β-alanine pathway
In previous study, we had constructed the β-alanine pathway to produce P3HP from inexpen-
sive carbon sources [4]. The phenomenon that addition of β-alanine improved P3HP produc-
tion suggested the insufficient intracellular β-alanine supply, which could be caused by two
possible reasons: low activity of L-aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) or low intracellular L-aspar-
tate concentration. To figure out the restricting factor of β-alanine pathway, E. coli BL21(DE3)
strain carrying pHP302 and pWQ513 (Q2153) was grown in shake flask, and 5 g/L β-alanine
or L-aspartate was added into the medium. As shown in Fig 2, the P3HP production with β-
alanine addition was 0.32 ± 0.01 g/L P3HP representing 7.7% of cell dry weight (CDW), which
is more than 3 times higher than that of the control group (0.11 ± 0.004 g/L), whereas L-aspar-
tate supplement increased the cell growth dramatically and did not change much the P3HP
production (0.13 ± 0.02 g/L). Also, there was a large amount of L-aspartate residues in the
medium. This result demonstrates that intracellular L-aspartate cannot be converted into β-
alanine effectively.
Moreover, a panD deleted strain lacked L-aspartate-α-decarbo xylase enzyme activity and
exhibited β-alanine auxotrophy [10]. And as reported, it has been suggested that the formation
of β-alanine is the rate-limiting step in the pantothenate biosynthesis pathway [11], and
enhanced expression of the C. glutamicum panD gene in E. coli overcomes the β-alanine limita-
tion in pantothenate biosynthesis [8]. So, it confirmed that PanD which converts L-aspartate
into β-alanine restricts the efficiency of the pathway.
Screening of the L-aspartate decarboxylase
Science PanD was proven to be the rate-limiting enzyme, it is important to find a more effi-
cient PanD to improve the P3HP production via β-alanine pathway. Three more genes encod-

Ec
gene from E. coli in plasmid pWQ513.
The resultant plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) strain along with pHP302 to gener-
ate P3HP-producing strains, respectively. After 48-h incubation in shake flask, the strain
Q2544 carrying panD
Cg
produced 0.32 ± 0.02 g/L P3HP (5.3% of CDW), which is 2.9-, 1.4-
and 2.3-fold higher than the strains carrying panD
Ec
(Q2153), panD
Bs
(Q2542), and panD
Pf
(Q2543), respectively (Fig 3), suggesting that the enzyme activity of PanD
Cg
is the highest
among these four enzymes. To confirm this speculation, PanD activity was assayed with crude
extracts of bacterial cell cultures. The specific activity of PanD
Ec
, PanD
Bs
, PanD
Pf
and PanD
Cg
were 0.83 U/mg, 6.37 U/mg, 0.91 U/mg and 7.82 U/mg, respectively. SDS-PAGE was also
performed to check the protein expression, however, no significant difference was observed
between different PanD proteins. Furthermore, the P3HP production of strain Q2544
increased by three times when either L-aspartate or β-alanine was added into culture, indicat-
ing that PanD
Cg
was sufficient to convert intracellular L-aspartate into β-alanine.
L-aspartate-α-decarbo xylase found in microorganisms is usually a homotetramer, it is ini-
tially translated as an inactive precursor protein (π-chain) which undergoes intramolecular
self-cleavage to create its active subunit form and cofactor [12]. The E. coli PanD is an unusual
enzyme in that it requires pyruvate as a covalently bound, activated by the putative acetyltrans-
ferase PanZ [13]. No over-expressing of suitable PanZ in this study might be the reason of
weak E. coli PanD activity. Compared with E. coli PanD, the maturation of C. glutamicum
PanD is independent of acetyl-coenzyme A sensor such as PanZ or PanM [14]. Also, the C. glu-
tamicum panD gene is preceded by a perfect SD sequence and can be efficiently translated,
resulting in higher activity [8]. However, the activity of C. glutamicum PanD in our study is
much lower than published papers [8,15], which may be caused by different C. glutamicum
strains and different metabolic systems.
Comparison of P3HP production in different E. coli strains
The choice of the host strain for microbial fermentation is very important for better produc-
tion. To maximize the level of P3HP production, four different E. coli strains were tested here.
After 48-h incubation in shake flask, the JM109(DE3) strain carrying pWQ302 and pFS03

accumulated 0.73 ± 0.02 g/L P3HP, which is much higher than the P3HP yield in BL21(DE3),
BL21 star(DE3), and BL21 Rosetta(DE3), although all these four strains possessed similar cell
dry weight (CDW) (Fig 4). So, JM109(DE3) strain was selected as the host for P3HP produc-
tion thereafter.
Optimisation of culture conditions
In the microbial production of desired products, culture conditions play a very important role,
so optimization of culture conditions is regarded as an effective method to improve the prod-
uct quality and quantity. Here, inducer concentration and organic nitrogen source were opti-
mized to enhance P3HP yield.
In our engineered strain, the expression of heterologous genes was induced by addition of
IPTG. To avoid the insufficient enzyme synthesis or metabolic burden to the cells caused by
improper inducing methods, several IPTG concentrations at different time intervals were
tested in shake flask culture. Addition of 0.025 mM IPTG resulted in quite low P3HP produc-
tion. With increased inducer concentration, the P3HP production was remarkably improved
and the maximum production of 0.98 ± 0.02 g/L was presented when IPTG was added at 0.05
mM every 24 hours (Table 2). However, IPTG at 0.1 mM severely repressed the cell growth
and P3HP accumulation probably because of its cell toxicity [16].
To test whether addition of organic nitrogen source improves the P3HP production, 3 g/L
of soya peptone, yeast extract, beef extract, and tryptone was added into the culture, respec-
tively. Addition of beef extract increased the P3HP yield to 1.35 ± 0.07 g/L, about 1.5-times
higher than the control group, whereas the P3HP production was repressed when soya pep-
tone or tryptone was supplied in the cell culture (Fig 5). Often the PHA production can be
improved under nitrogen-limited condition [17], which was also observed in this study when
using soya peptone and tryptone. However, the P3HP production increased with beef extract,
which is a new interesting phenomenon found in this study. The pathway used in this study
work with amino acid and transaminases, so it is possible that beef extract not only provide
some vitamins but also serve as a potential source of amino acid (alanine or aspartate) to
enhance the efficiency of the pathway.

Fed-batch fermentation
In order to test the suitability of the recombinant E. coli strains for an improved P3HP produc-
tion process, we carried out fed-batch fermentation based on the results obtained with flask
cultures. The fermentations were performed under aerobic condition using E. coli JM109
(DE3) harboring pHP302 and pFS03, and cell growth and P3HP accumulation were moni-
tored over the course of fermentation. As shown in Fig 6, the cell mass reached the maximum
of 26.9 g/L after 48h fermentation whereas the highest P3HP production of 10.2 ± 0.64 g/L
(39.1% of CDW) was achieved after 60h. To date, this is the highest P3HP production via β-
alanine pathway. However, the yield was relatively low (S1 Fig), which means that further
research of the metabolism characteristics of the whole pathway should be done to improve
the conversion efficiency.
Though the P3HP production in this study is a little lower compared with the previous
report [18], the pathway used in this study has some advantages including no addition of coen-
zyme, redox neutral, and wide range of carbon sources [4]. As the bioreactor mixing efficiency

and pFS03 was used, and 3 g/L of soya peptone , yeast extract, beef extract, and tryptone was added into the
culture, respectively. Incubation without organic nitrogen was used as the control (CK). The P3HP production
(white), CDW (light grey), and P3HP content (heavy grey) were presented. All shake-flas k experime nts were
incubated at 30˚C for 48 h after the first time of induction . The experime nts were performed in triplicat e shake-
flask cultures.

may affect the cell population behavior [19] and improve the production, it is worthy to note
that higher P3HP content may be obtained with optimized aeration condition, oxygen pres-
sure, substrate addition strategy, and reactor configuration.
Conclusions
In this study, P3HP production was improved by optimized β-alanine pathway with L-aspar-
tate decarboxylase from Corynebacteria glutamicum. When PanD
C
was overexpressed in engi-
neered E. coli JM109(DE3) strain, 0.98 g/L P3HP was accumulated in flask cultures with
optimized conditions, and the P3HP production and content reached to 10.2g/L and 39.1%
(wt/wt [cell dry weight]) respectively in fed-batch fermentation with minimal medium. This is
the highest P3HP production by recombinant Escherichia coli strain without VB
12
.
