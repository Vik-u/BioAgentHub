A novel 3-hydroxypropionic acid-
inducible promoter regulated 
by the LysR-type transcriptional 
activator protein MmsR of 
Pseudomonas denitrificans
Nam Hoai Nguyen1,2, Satish Kumar Ainala2, Shengfang Zhou3 & Sunghoon Park1,2
MmsR (33.3 kDa) is a putative LysR-type transcriptional activator of Pseudomonas denitrificans. With 
the help of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), an important platform chemical, MmsR positively regulates 
the expression of mmsA, which encodes methylmalonylsemialdehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme 
involved in valine degradation. In the present study, the cellular function of MmsR and its binding to the 
regulatory DNA sequence of mmsA expression were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Transcription 
of the mmsA was enhanced >140-fold in the presence of 3-HP . In the MmsR-responsive promoter 
region, two operators showing dyad symmetry, designated O
1 and O2 and centered at the −79 and −28 
positions, respectively, were present upstream of the mmsA transcription start site. An electrophoretic 
mobility shift assay indicated that MmsR binds to both operator sites for transcription activation, 
probably in cooperative manner. When either O1 or O2 or both regions were mutated, the inducibility by 
the MmsR-3-HP complex was significantly reduced or completely removed, indicating that both sites 
are required for transcription activation. A 3-HP sensor was developed by connecting the activation of 
MmsR to a green fluorescent readout. A more than 50-fold induction by 25 mM 3-HP was observed.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a commercially important platform chemical that can be converted to acrylic 
acid, malonic acid, acrylamide, 1,3-propanediol and other valuable chemicals. Biologically, 3-HP can be pro-
duced from glucose or glycerol
1. With glucose as the carbon source, 3-HP can be synthesized via malonyl-CoA 
or β-alanine. With glycerol as the carbon source, 3-HP is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions, catalyzed by 
the coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase converting glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) 
and the 3-HPA-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizing 3-HPA to 3-HP , respectively. Several microorganisms, 
including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas denitrificans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have 
been developed as hosts
2,3. Among them, K. pneumoniae and P. denitrificans are advantageous when glycerol is 
used as the carbon source because they can naturally synthesize coenzyme B12
4,5.
In the course of the development of P . denitrificans as the 3-HP production host, we observed that 3-HP 
was actively degraded 6. Several enzymes, namely putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase IV (HbdH-4), 
3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (HpdH) and/or methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MmsA), 
were involved in 3-HP degradation
7 (see Fig. 1a for the gene arrangement of mmsA and hbdH4; hpdH is present in 
a separate operon). Furthermore, we found that the transcription of the mmsA gene encoding the MmsA enzyme 
was up-regulated at a high level (> 100-fold) but only in the presence of 3-HP
8. This suggests that there exists 
positive regulation on the expression of the enzyme, where 3-HP acts as an inducer. Analysis of gene arrange-
ment near mmsA revealed the presence of a putative LysR-family transcriptional regulator protein that could be 
transcribed in the opposite direction of mmsA. It was speculated that the transcriptional regulator protein, when 
complexed with 3-HP , activates the transcription of mmsA. Considering the nature of this promoter (inducible by

3-HP) and its high induction efficiency (over 100-fold), the promoter should be useful for the expression of path-
way enzymes for 3-HP synthesis or development of 3-HP-responsive biosensors. However, the biochemical char-
acteristics of the transcriptional activator protein, including its binding sequences, have not yet been revealed.
This study aimed to elucidate the 3-HP-inducible gene regulation necessary for the expression of mmsA at the 
cellular and biochemical levels. At the cellular level, the specificity and/or spectrum of the small-molecule induc-
er(s) was studied using various acids structurally similar to 3-HP or the intermediates appearing in the L-valine 
degradation pathway and central carbon metabolism. The role of MmsR, the putative transcriptional activa-
tor protein, was confirmed by the removal of mmsR from the chromosome and subsequent complementation. 
Additionally, the promoter region that contains two operator sites (O
1 and O2) was characterized by site-directed 
mutagenesis on each or both sites. At the biochemical level, the interactions of MmsR protein, 3-HP and the 
promoter region of mmsA were investigated by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting 
using purified recombinant MmsR. Finally, a biosensor for the detection of 3-HP was developed and tested by 
expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the promoter activated by MmsR. This study should be useful 
for developing efficient 3-HP synthetic pathways and 3-HP sensors in many microorganisms.
Results and Discussion
Specificity of small-molecule inducers for MmsR transcriptional activator protein. According to 
our previous study, the putative transcription activator protein MmsR (previously designated C4-LysR) is com-
posed of the N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain for DNA binding, the C-terminal domain for inducer binding 
that responds to 3-HP , and a linker connecting the two domains
8. The spectrum of the inducer molecules for 
MmsR was studied using various acids and alcohols, such as L-lactic acid (LAC (2 )), acetic acid (AcOH (3 )), 
propionic acid (PA (4)), 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB (5)), 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO (6)) and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-
BDO (7)), as well as L-valine (L-val (8 )) and its degradation intermediate 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB (9 )). 
Most of the acids and alcohols tested were chosen mainly due to their similarity to 3-HP in size and/or structure. 
On the other hand, L-val and 3-HIB were chosen because mmsA, whose transcription was regulated by MmsR, 
encodes methylmalonylsemialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in L-val degradation. P. denitrificans 
was cultured on minimal medium with and without each compound to be tested, and transcription of mmsA  
was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1b). The housekeeping gene rpoD , encoding sigma factor 70, was 
used as a reference. Transcription of the mmsA gene was enhanced markedly upon exposure of P . denitrificans 
to chemicals compared to basal expression level in non-induction condition, such as 3-HIB (9) (154-fold), 3-HB 
(5) (38-fold) and L-val (8) (72-fold), in addition to 3-HP (1) (134-fold). By contrast, limited or no induction was 
observed after exposure to LAC (2 ), AcOH (3), PA (4), 1,3-PDO (6 ) and 2,3-BDO (7 ). As with all β -hydroxy 
acids, the chemicals 3-HP , 3-HB and 3-HIB are structurally similar (Fig. 1c), and the structural feature of having 
both the carboxyl and β-hydroxy groups seems to be integral to the ability to bind to MmsR. L-val, structurally

much different from these three compounds, is converted to 3-HIB, and the induction by L-val is attributable to 
L-val-derived 3-HIB rather than to L-val itself (Fig. 1a).
We also examined the possibility that malonate semialdehyde (MSA, derived from 3-HP) and methyl-
malonate semialdehyde (MMSA, derived from L-val and 3-HIB) rather than 3-HP and/or 3-HIB are the phys-
iological inducers (see Figs  1a and 2a). In general, aldehydes are toxic, and aldehyde-degrading genes are often 
up-regulated when aldehydes are accumulated
9. According to our previous study 6, 3-HP was degraded by the 
enzymes encoded by hpdH, hbdH4 and hbdH1, and the deletion mutant P. denitrificans ΔhpdHΔhbdH4ΔhbdH1 
did not degrade 3-HP at an appreciable rate. As shown in Fig. 2a, in the triple mutant, which should not produce 
MSA from 3-HP , transcription of mmsA was nonetheless up-regulated by 3-HP . This indicates that 3-HP can 
activate MmsR protein without being converted to MSA. Similarly, transcription of mmsA was up-regulated by 
3-HIB in the triple mutant, suggesting that 3-HIB is also a real inducer of MmsR.
To confirm the physiological role of MmsR as a transcriptional activator, deletion and subsequent comple-
mentation experiments were conducted (Fig. 2b). In the deletion mutant (ΔmmsR), transcription of mmsA was 
low, and the level was not affected by 3-HP . On the other hand, when mmsR was re-introduced to the ΔmmsR 
mutant by a plasmid, up-regulation of mmsA by 3-HP was fully restored. These results confirm that MmsR is a 
real transcriptional activator protein for the expression of mmsA.
In vivo characterization of mmsA promoter region. The transcriptional start site (TSS) of mmsA was 
identified by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)10. It was located at the G residue, −15 relative to the 
translation start of the mmsA structural gene (Supplementary Fig. S1). The putative −35 box (TGTTAG) and −10 
box (AAAAAG) were predicted based on the TSS, which were spaced by 17 bp.
Importance of − 10 and −35 boxes was studied by 5′  end mapping and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.  3). 
For the mapping experiment, the P mmsA promoter region including the putative − 10 and − 35 regions were 
sequentially deleted and their strength was determined using GFP as reporter. P . denitrificans either lacking or 
expressing the mmsR gene was used as a host because MmsR considerably affects the promoter strength. In the 
ΔmmsR strain (un-induced condition), when the promoter region between −115 and −58 (P_Δ1) or −115 and 
−35 (P_Δ2) was deleted, the gfp expression decreased by approximately 16% compared to that of the control 
(P_wt), which contains the whole-length promoter. In comparison, when a longer upstream sequence before 
−24 (P_Δ3) or −14 (P_Δ4) was deleted, the promoter strength decreased more considerably by 39 or 58%, 
respectively (see Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the sequences deleted, from −35 to −14 relative to the TSS, 
in P_Δ3 and P_Δ4, should contain important elements for transcription, most likely the −10 or −35 regions. In 
addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the putative −10 (P-10
mut) and −35 (P-35mut) regions reduced the promoter 
strength by 52% in comparison to that of P_wt (see Fig. 3B). The site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been 
repeated for the mmsR+ strain. Under the induced conditions with 3-HP , GFP intensity was high at 82 × 103 AU/
OD600. In comparison, GFP intensity after mutation of either the putative −10 box (P-10mut) or −35 (P-35mut) box 
was only 3–5 × 103 AU/OD600 which is ~5% of that by P_wt (see Fig. 3B,C). When either the putative −10 or −35 
box was deleted, presence of MmsR and 3-HP did not affect the gfp expression level (see Fig.  3C). Altogether, 
these results reveal the importance of the −10 and −35 regions which positioned from −34 to −29 and from −11 
to −6 relative to the TSS, respectively, in PmmsA.

In vivo characterization of mmsA operator region. Before experimental characterization, in silico anal-
ysis of the operator region was briefly conducted 11. Analysis by mfold web server 12 identified the presence of a 
good stem-loop structure formed from dyad symmetry, often appearing as cis-acting element in many prokar -
yotic operators, with a spacer of 15 bp (see Supplementary Fig. S2a). This palindromic region was hypothesized 
as O1 site (from −95 to −63 relative to the TSS) and used as query for searching the second operator site O 2, 
which is known to be less stringent, pseudo-palindrome. Two best candidates with good matches and spaced 
by 15 bp, AAAAATGCA-N15-CAGACAACAA (candidate 1, locating from −44 to −12 relative to the TSS) and 
TAGGATCGA-N15-AGCCACAGG (candidate 2, locating from − 31 to +2 relative to the TSS) were identified 
(see Supplementary Fig. S2b). Furthermore, based on the typical location of O2 site (ABS) in relation to the pro-
moter region in other LTTR systems13–17 (see Supplementary Fig. S2c), the first candidate, which was overlapped 
with the −35 element only, was suggested as the better candidate than the other one. The analysis shows that 
the dyad in the putative O1 site (from −95 to −63 relative to the TSS) is highly symmetrical, with only a single 
mismatch, while the inverted repeat in the putative O2 site (from −44 to −12 relative to the TSS) has 7 bases mis-
matched among the 9 (Fig. 4A). Alignment of the four palindromic fragments of the putative O1 and O2 operators 
showed the existence of the consensus sequence AATGTGCAA (Fig. 4B). Two bases T and G at positions 5 and 
6 (bold), respectively, were fully conserved in all the fragments, and the three bases A, C, A at positions 2, 7 and 8 
(underlined), respectively, were highly conserved in three fragments.
The 5′  end mapping and site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed using GFP as reporter 
(Fig. 4A,C). To account for the possibility that mmsR is auto-regulated by itself and the auto-regulation inter -
feres with the gfp transcription, mmsR was constitutively expressed from a plasmid under the control of the 
weak P
c1 promoter (3hibdH-I promoter18) (see Materials and Methods). The sequences of O_wt (intact intergenic 
region) and O_ Δ1 (downstream from position − 98 relative to the TSS) that contain both the putative oper -
ators (O1 and O2) exhibited high 3-HP induction up to ~34.6-fold. In comparison, when removing sequence 
upstream from position −79 containing the first half site of the putative O1 site (O_Δ2) or further eliminating 
additional sequences down to −48 (O_Δ3) and −21 (O_Δ4) containing the other half site of O1 and O2 regions, 
respectively; inducibility was completely lost (see Fig.  4C). It is noticed that the basal level under MmsR (over)
expression (O_Δ series) has been significantly decreased compared to that lacking MmsR (P_Δ series shown in 
Fig. 3) even though their sequence features are nearly identical. This suggests that the inducer-free MmsR pro-
tein represses the mmsA expression. Once the complete O 1 site and half site of O2 are removed, this repression 
effect is abolished, as depicted by similar expression levels for O_Δ4 and P_Δ3. Effect of mutation (site-directed 
mutagenesis) in the O
1 and/or O 2 region on the promoter strength was also investigated. Here, the operator 
sequences were carefully modified to destroy the dyad symmetry without affecting the −35 region. The palindro-
mic region of O1 site (AATGTGCAA-N15-TTGCACATC) was changed to ATCCTTGCT-N15-CGCCCAGGC 
in O1
mut or O1

mut or O1
mutO2
mut mutations, with the underlined letters 
indicated the modified nucleotides (see Supplementary Table S2 for whole sequences). As expected, mutation of 
O1 (O1
mut) or both O1 and O2 (O1
mutO2
mut) completely abolished the inducibility by 3-HP . When the putative O2 
region alone was mutated (O2
mut), promoter strength in the absence of 3-HP greatly increased (~10-fold) com-
pared to that of wild-type O_wt. When 3-HP is present, the strength was reduced by 37% (compared to that of 
wild type O_wt) but still remained at a relatively high level. This suggests that the O
2 site has an important role 
in regulating P mmsA function and strength, although its role or association with the O 1 site is yet to be further 
elucidated. Collectively, the in vivo studies on the operator regions can be summarized as follows: (i) O1 alone can 
activate the transcription (with the help of 3-HP-MmsR complex), although less efficiently than when both O 1 
and O2 are present; (ii) binding of 3-HP-free MmsR to the O2 operator can suppress transcription from the PmmsA 
promoter; and (iii) the high strength of the promoter of the O2 mutant still requires the presence of the O1 site. 
It is most likely that the PmmsA promoter is regulated positively (in the presence of 3-HP) as well as negatively (in 
the absence of 3-HP).
The LTTR proteins and their cis -acting elements have been studied in several microorganisms. In the two 
symmetrical operator regions, termed RBS (Regulatory Binding Site) and ABS (Activator Binding Site), RBS was 
reported to have a better symmetry than ABS. In addition, the full sites of RBS and ABS were known to be often 
embraced by T-N
11-A motifs. In E . coli and Salmonella typhimurium  LT2, the IlvY protein (a LysR-type tran-
scription regulatory protein) controlled the expression of ilvC gene (encoding acetohydroxy acid isomerase; EC 
1.1.1.86)19. Transcription of the ilvC gene was induced by the substrates of acetohydroxy acid isomerase, acetohy-
droxybutyrate or acetolactate, and the induction was mediated by the IlvY protein. Similar to the PmmsA promoter 
under study, the promoter region of the ilvY and ilvC genes had two operators, O1 and O2, and each operator was 
composed of 9-bp-long inverted repeats. The repeats shared homologous sequences, A(T)CATTGCAA in E. coli 
and AT(A)GTTGC(A)GN in S. typhimurium LT2, respectively. Moreover, similar to the case in P. denitrificans, 
symmetry between the two dyads in these strains was more stringent in O 1 (a single mismatch) than in O2 (six 
mismatches). Another LysR-type activator AtzR, which is present in Pseudomonas sp., has been reported to show 
the dissimilarity in the ABS operator region. AtzR activates the expression of divergently transcribed cyanuric 
acid degradative operon atzDEF . However, ABS contained three motifs, designated ABS-1, ABS-2 and ABS-3, 
in which individual subsites had distinct roles in the activation process. In vivo mutational analysis showed that

O1 and mutant O2. (B) Consensus sequence between O1 and O2 operator sequences of mmsR-mmsA intergenic

ABS-1 and ABS-2 subsites were required for full activation of the PaztDEF promoter. In contrast, ABS-3 functioned 
as a ‘subunit trap’ leading to inactivation of P aztDEF when AtzR was shifted to the ABS-2 and ABS-3 subsites 20. 
Similar dual functions of the ABS operator region have been reported with CbbR17 and DntR21. With the PmmsA 
under study, O2 site also seems to have the dual functions for both activation and repression. However, neither the 
presence of such multiple ABS’s nor shift of MmsR protein has been identified. For other LysR proteins such as 
IlvY14, CatR16, ClcR15 and HpaR22, the dual functions of O2 site has also been reported but without multiple ABS 
shown in AtzR. Further investigations are required to clarify the location of the O2 site(s) in the PmmsA promoter 
and the mechanism for the dual functions, if present.
Production of MmsR protein and its binding to operator sites in vitro.  For biochemical char -
acterization in vitro, a recombinant MmsR protein tagged with six histidine residues at the C-terminus of the 
protein was produced and purified from recombinant E . coli. The His-tag MmsR protein at either the C- or 
N-terminus showed the same performance as the native MmsR protein in the complementation experiments 
described in Fig.  2b (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for details); thus, one recombinant MmsR, C-His-tagged only, 
was studied in vitro. After careful optimization of the culture conditions (temperature, culture medium, IPTG 
concentration, harvest time and 3-HP concentration as well as co-expression with various chaperones, such 
as GroEL-ES, DnaKJ-GrpE and trigger factors; see Supplementary Fig. S4), the recombinant MmsR could be 
expressed in soluble form at a high level in E. coli by co-expression of mmsR-expressing plasmid and pGro7 
containing groES-groEL chaperones (see Supplementary Fig. S4b) and purified by affinity chromatography (see 
Supplementary Fig. S5a). The size of the His-tag-fused MmsR protein was estimated to be 34.4 kDa, which is in 
good agreement with the size estimate based on the 6x his-mmsR gene sequence. According to native PAGE and/
or gel filtration analyses, the MmsR protein was monomeric at the low concentration of 65 nM, while dimeric at 
the high concentration of 550 nM (see Supplementary Figs S5b and S7).
The binding ability of MmsR to the mmsR-mmsA intergenic region was studied in vitro by EMSA (Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Fig. S6). A total of 40 nM of the complete 130 bp DNA fragment containing the sequence from 
−115 to +16 relative to the TSS was used as a probe (designated the F
12 fragment; see Fig. 4A), and the purified 
MmsR protein at varying concentration at 0–48.5 nM was incubated with the DNA probe in both the presence and 
absence of 3-HP as an inducer. Similar to in vivo experiment, the sequences, ATCCTTGCT-N15-CGCCCAGGC 
and ATCCTTGCT-N15-CAGGCACAA, were applied to destroy the dyad symmetry in O1 and O2 sites, respec-
tively, for generation of F1M2, F12M, and F1M2M fragments (see Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S2 for sequence 
information). The DNA fragment mutated in both O 1 and O2 (F1M2M) was used as a negative control. In elec-
trophoresis, band shift appeared for the intact 130 bp DNA fragment when MmsR was added, and the ratio of 
the shifted DNA to un-shifted DNA increased upon amplifying the concentration of the MmsR protein during 
incubation. In contrast, no such mobility retardation was observed with the control DNA fragment up to 72.7 nM 
of MmsR protein (data not shown). This indicates that MmsR has a strong binding affinity to the native P
mmsA, 
and they form a binding complex in vitro. At high concentrations of the MmsR protein, multiple bands traveling 
shorter distances appeared (see Fig. 5). It may attribute to the formation of diverse oligomeric complexes among 
the DNA fragments and protein molecules. The DNA probe has two binding sites (O 1 and O2) for MmsR, and 
MmsR binds to the DNA as a dimer; thus, it is highly probable that DNA and protein form diverse oligomeric

Three DNA fragments containing intact O1and O2 (F12), or mutated in either O2 site (F12M) or O1 site (F1M2) were 
used as probe. The experiments were conducted in the absence (upper panel) or presence (lower panel) of 3-HP 
(at 25 mM). Lanes 1–10, increasing amounts of the MmsR protein at 0, 0.36, 0.73, 1.45, 2.9, 5.8, 11.6, 14.5, 24.2 
and 48.5 nM. Lane 11–13 and 14–15, increasing amounts of the MmsR protein at 2.9, 11.6 and 48.5 nM. The 
red arrows indicate the shifted complexes. The concentration of DNA fragments was fixed at 40 nM. Figures for 
EMSA experiments of F
12M and F1M2 were cropped from full-length gels shown in Supplementary Fig. S6.

complexes when their concentrations are high. Figure 5 also shows the effect of 3-HP on binding between MmsR 
and the PmmsA promoter. In the presence of 3-HP , intensity of the shifted band increased at lower MmsR concen-
trations (for a clear comparison, see lane 4 in the panels of F 12). This suggests that 3-HP promotes the binding 
affinity between MmsR and the P mmsA promoter. The EMSA experiments were also conducted with two DNA 
fragments having mutation (site-directed mutagenesis) in the palindromic regions of either O1 (F1M2) or O2 (F12M) 
operator site (see Fig.  4A and Supplementary Table S2 for sequence information). Under the same incubation 
condition, more intensive shifted-bands were observed with F12Mcompared to that with F1M2 in either absence or 
presence of 3-HP . This suggests higher affinity of MmsR toward O1 operator than O2 operator. Interestingly, the 
addition of 3-HP greatly reduced the binding of MmsR to the O 2 region (see the panels for F1M2 in Fig. 5). This 
suggests that, along with the DNase I footprinting results (see below), ABS region should become less occupied 
by MmsR in the presence of 3-HP . Rhee et al. also studied the binding affinity of E. coli IlvY protein to DNA frag-
ments containing either the tandem operators (O 1O2) or the O1 or O2 operator alone. The binding affinity was 
highest with the fragment containing the tandem O 1O2 operator and lowest with the O2 operator. However, in 
their system, the inducer molecule did not affect the binding of IlvY protein to the operators14.
DNAase I footprinting on operator-promoter region. The MmsR binding regions was also studied by 
DNase I footprinting based on capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 6). The longer 169 bp DNA fragment that includes 
the complete 130 bp intergenic region (employed in the previous EMSA experiments) was used as a probe 
(Supplementary Table S2). DNA concentration was fixed at 230 nM, while MmsR concentration varied in 0–1.2 
μM. The footprinting results exhibit the presence of two protected regions by MmsR, which should correspond to 
operator O1 (centered at position −79) and O2 (centered at position −28), respectively. Protection became more 
evident as MmsR concentration increased. However, it was difficult to pinpoint the boundary of protection at the 
base-pair level of the DNA sequence. Between the O
1 and O2 operators, the former was more protected than the 
latter and this confirms the higher affinity of the O1 site than the O2 site toward MmsR. Addition of 3-HP barely 
affected the DNase I footprinting for the O1 operator. However, for the O2 operator, as indicated by appearance 
of more unprotected peaks (at the high MmsR concentration of 1.2 μM), a weaker protection was observed when 
3-HP was added (Fig. 6). This result agrees with EMSA experiment, i.e., in the presence of 3-HP , the O2 region is 
less susceptible to MmsR.
A relaxation of DNA bending in O 2 or ABS region, as studied with AtzR 13, IlvY 19 and CatR 15, was sug-
gested as a common mechanism for transcription activation of LysR-type regulator. Two major mechanisms 
of LTTR-mediated transcription activation have been suggested; (i) ‘sliding dimer mechanism’ where a LysR 
protein, when bound with a inducer molecule, shifts from one ABS (called ‘downstream ABS’) to another ABS 
(‘upstream ABS’) leading to free −35 region, as studied with AtzR
13, CbbR17 and DntR23, and (ii) ‘different-side 
binding model’ where RNAP and LysR can contact different sides of DNA helix, as studies with IlvY 19, CatR15, 
and ClcR15. According to our study on the mmsR-mmsA intergenic region, no extra ABS is present and the PmmsA

intergenic region was digested by DNase I in the absence (left) and presence (right) of 3-HP and analyzed using 
capillary electrophoresis. Sequence positions (x-axis) are marked with reference to the ROX 500 internal size-
standard (M). The y-axis indicates relative fluorescent units (ABI 3130). MmsR concentration increased from 
0 to 1.2 µM (concentrations were indicated on the left hand side). Dotted two black boxes (putative O
1 and O2) 
in both panels indicate that DNase I digestion is inhibited by MmsR in dose-dependent manner. Red arrows 
highlight the change in protection by added 3-HP .

promoter functions better when the −35 box was not or less occupied by MmsR. This eliminate the first mecha-
nism, although does not provide evidences to support the second mechanism.
Use of 3-HP-inducible promoter as 3-HP biosensor. The current dynamic promoter responding to 
3-HP could be developed as a 3-HP sensor. The performance as a biosensor was briefly examined using the 
regulatory region containing both O
1 and O2 sites (F12 fragment) with GFP as the reporter. MmsR protein was 
produced by the constitutive and weak promoters Pc1 of P. denitrificans and from the same plasmid as GFP . When 
measured at 12 h, the fluorescent signal was enhanced as the 3-HP concentration increased to 25 mM, and the fold 
difference compared with the control (for which no 3-HP was added) was >50 (Fig. 7A). The derived time-course 
profile (Fig. 7B) shows the fluorescent signal increasing with time and 3-HP concentration. The response of the 
biosensor to 25 mM 3-HP started immediately and did not reach the point of saturation until after 12 h. It was 
noted that the background fluorescence of the control (without 3-HP) was low and was not different from that of 
the host P. denitrificans without the recombinant plasmid. This indicates that the transcription of gfp is blocked 
almost completely and that leaky expression is negligible when 3-HP is absent. We attributed this tight control of 
gene expression to the repressive function of 3-HP-free MmsR protein when bound to the O
2 operator.
Recently, Rogers and Church reported development of 3-HP biosensors based on helper enzymes that convert 
3-HP to the acuR-binding compound acrylate or prpR-binding 2-methylcitrate24. Both sensors could detect 3-HP 
successfully but only after conversion to acrylate or 2-methylcitrate. In comparison, the current MmsR biosensor 
directly recognizes 3-HP and does not require any helper enzymes. Furthermore, it generally has a better sensitiv-
ity and dynamic range. On this basis, we believe that the current biosensor is more convenient to use.
Conclusions
MmsR in P. denitrificans functions as a transcriptional regulator activating the expression of the mmsA gene from 
its responsive promoter PmmsA. The fold increase in the transcription of mmsA by 3-HP induction was >140. The 
responsive promoter PmmsA had two operator regions, designated O1 and O2, positioned at –79 and –28, respec-
tively, upstream of the transcription start site of the mmsA gene. Binding of MmsR to O1 and O2 did not require an 
inducer molecule, but transcription activation strictly required it. Each of the O1 and O2 operators was composed 
of two 9-bp-long inverted repeats, and a mutation in the inverted repeats resulted in the reduction or complete 
loss of their binding capability to MmsR. The inducible promoter was developed as a biosensor for detection of 
3-HP . With GFP as the reporter, the sensor showed a good response up to 25 mM 3-HP . This study will prove 
useful for the biotechnological application of the P
mmsA promoter.
Materials and Methods
Materials. P. denitrificans ATCC 13867 was purchased from ATCC (America). The primers were synthesized 
by Macrogen Co. Ltd (Seoul, Korea). 3-HP was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and 
TCI America (Portland). Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals and enzymes were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Development of P. denitrificansΔmmsR. To construct the deletion mutant P. denitrificansΔmmsR, the 
previously developed sacB -based method was used 5. The pQSAK plasmid, which has a sacB -Km cassette, was 
used to knock off the mmsR gene from the chromosome (Supplementary Table S1). An engineered fragment con-
taining the ~600–700 bp upstream (QS-mmsR-US) and downstream (QS-mmsR-DS) regions of the mmsR gene 
was generated by PCR from P. denitrificans genomic DNA. The fragment was cloned into the pQSAK vector using 
Figure 7. (A) The 3-HP triggered fluorescence in cells containing the biosensor (green bar) in a dose-
dependent manner up to 25 mM of 3-HP when measured at 12 h. The host cells without the biosensor (black 
bar) did not respond to 3-HP . (B) The response of the biosensor to 25 mM 3-HP (red downward triangle) 
started immediately and continued to increase up to 12 h after induction. Basal induction in the host cells (black 
circle) or in the biosensor without 3-HP (blue circle) was low. Three independent measurements for each were 
conducted and the results were averaged.

the GeneArt seamless cloning and assembly kit (Invitrogen, USA) and confirmed for sequence. The recombinant 
plasmid subsequently was used for homologous recombination.
Complementation of ΔmmsR mutation and effect of His-tag on MmsR function.  The ORF 
of the mmsR gene was PCR-amplified from P . denitrificans genomic DNA and overlapped with a native con-
stitutive Pc1 promoter (controlling expression of the 3hibdh -I gene18) of P. denitrificans. The overlapped frag-
ment was then cloned into the shuttle vector pUCPK’ , which had been modified from the previously developed 
plasmid pUCPK’
5. The resultant plasmid was designated pUCPK’/Pc1-mmsR, and the recombinant plasmid was 
introduced by electroporation into the P . denitrificansΔmmsR mutant to develop the complementation strain, 
mmsR-C. In order to evaluate the effect of His-tag on MmsR function, plasmids overexpressing the His-tagged 
MmsR at the N- or C-terminus were constructed. The resultant plasmids and recombinant strains were des-
ignated pUCPK’/P
c1-N6xhis-mmsR, pUCPK’/Pc1-mmsR-C6xhis and N-his-mmsR-C, C-his-mmsR-C.Details of 
primers were given in Supplementary Table S3.
RNA extraction and Real-time PCR. The P. denitrificans strains were grown in M9-minimal medium 
containing 5 g/L sodium gluconate. The cells were cultivated under the aerobic condition at 37 °C and 200 rpm in 
an orbital incubator shaker. 3-HP and/or various chemicals (3-hydroxyisobutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, L-valine, 
lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, 1,3-propanediol and 2,3-butanediol) at 25 mM was supplemented at the 
OD
600 of ~0.4–0.5. After a further 2 h cultivation, approximately 5 × 108 cells were collected and centrifuged at 
5,000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were immediately resuspended in 500 μL of RNA solution (Ambion, UK) and 
RNA was extracted using a total RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). One microgram of total RNA 
was employed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA in a 20 µL reaction using the SuperScript III first-strand syn-
thesis system (Invitrogen, USA). A real-time PCR analysis was performed, according to the SYBR green method, 
in a 20 µL reaction volume using the StepOne Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR effi-
ciencies of all of the primers were experimentally determined and found to be suitable for reliable copy-number 
quantification. The mRNA quantity was estimated based on ΔΔCT value, as described previously
25. The assays 
were performed in duplicate, and a template-less reaction was used as a negative control.
Construction plasmids. Supplementary Table S1 lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study. 
E. coli BL21 (DE3) served as the host for protein production, and E. coli Top10 was used for routine cloning and 
plasmid maintenance. The LB medium was used for the growth of E. coli. Ampicillin at 100 mg/L was added to 
the culture medium when needed. Gene manipulation was carried out using standard methods 7. The plasmid 
pET30b(+) was used to clone the mmsR gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). The mmsR gene was amplified from P. deni-
trificans genomic DNA by PCR and the fragment was ligated into the pET30b(+) vector using a seamless cloning 
and assembly kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pET30b(+ )/mmsR, which contained the ET-mmsR gene 
with the His-tag at the C -terminus, was sequenced by Macrogen Co., Ltd., Korea, and introduced into E . coli 
BL21(DE3).
The plasmid pUCPK was used to develop3-HP biosensor in P . denitrificans . The sequences for UC- Pc1, 
UC-mmsR and UC-PmmsA were amplified from P . denitrificans genomic DNA by PCR, while the UC- gfp gene, 
encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP), was amplified from pPro24-gfp (Addgene). Four DNA frag-
ments of UC- Pc1, UC-mmsR, UC-P
mmsA and UC-gfp were overlapped and ligated into the pET30b(+ ) vector 
using a seamless cloning and assembly kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pUCPK-P c1-mmsR-PmmsA-gfp, 
was sequenced by Macrogen Co., Ltd., Korea, and introduced into P. denitrificans. Details of primers are given in 
Supplementary Table S3.
Plasmids used in deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis were constructed by amplifying various tar-
get fragments, such as P_wt-gfp, P_Δ1-gfp, P_Δ2-gfp, P_Δ3-gfp, P_Δ4-gfp, P-10mut-gfp, P-35 mut-gfp, O_wt-gfp, 
O_ Δ1-gfp, O_ Δ2-gfp, O_ Δ3-gfp, O_ Δ4-gfp, O1 mut-gfp, O2
mut-gfp and O1
mutO2
mut-gfp, using the recombinant 
pUCPK-Pc1-mmsR-PmmsA-gfp plasmid as template with the primers shown in Supplementary Table S3. The ampli-
fied PCR fragments were ligated into the pUCPK or pUCPK-Pc1-mmsR vectors (Supplementary Table S3) using 
a seamless cloning and assembly kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids was sequenced by Macrogen Co., Ltd., 
Korea, and introduced into P. denitrificansWT or P. denitrificansΔmmsR.
Transcription start site identification. To determine the 5′ end of the mmsA transcript, 5′ rapid ampli-
fication of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR was performed using a SMARTer ® RACE 5′/3′ kit (Clontech, USA). The 
RACE experiment was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Synthesis of the first strand cDNA 
was performed on 1 μg of the DNase-treated total RNA of P . denitrificans (wild-type) grown under induction 
condition as described before. RACE fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Qiagen gel-extraction 
kit and cloned into the linearized pRACE vector with In-Fusion HD Cloning (Takara, Japan). DNA from seven 
colonies of each RACE synthesis was sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers. Primer extension 
assays were performed as previously described (Zeng et al . 2002), except that 50 µg of total RNA, derived from 
transfected 293 T cells, was used. The sequence of gene-specific primer (mmsA-GSP5-RP) used for RACE was: 
′5-GATTACGCCAAGCTTCGGCCCGAGGTCGCCCAGCTTGGAGCCGCG-3
′.
Expression and purification of MmsR protein. For the production of soluble His-tagged MmsR, pET-
30b(+)/mmsR was co-expressed with various chaperone plasmids, i.e. pG-KJE8, pGRO7, pKJE7, pG-TF2, and 
pTF-16 (Takara, Japan), in E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant BL21(DE3) strains were grown in LB medium 
supplemented with 50 mg/L kanamycin, 25 mg/L chloramphenicol and/or 0.5 mg/mL L-arabinose. The cells were 
grown aerobically in 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 350 mL of medium at 30 °C and 200 rpm in an orbital incu-
bator shaker. The cells were induced at ~0.6 OD600 with 0.1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 
and grown at 25 °C, 150 rpm for 10 h. The cells were then harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The

pellets were washed with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in the binding buffer 
(20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole). The resuspended cells were 
disrupted using the French Pressure Cell (FA-078A, Thermo Electron Corp.; Waltham, MA, USA) at 1,250 psi. 
The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to remove the particulate fraction and unbroken 
cells. The soluble fraction was subjected to purification under non-denaturing conditions by Ni-affinity chroma-
tography using a Ni-NTA-HP resin column (17-5248-01; GE Healthcare, Sweden). The eluents from the column 
were pooled and dialyzed using a 10 kDa cut-off membrane to remove the salts. The resulting enzyme extract was 
electrophoresed under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions, as described by Laemmli, and the extract was 
stored at −80 °C in 20% glycerol.
DNase I footprinting analysis of the mmsA promoter. DNase I footprinting analysis was conducted 
using an automated capillary sequencer 26. FAM-labeled fragments of the mmsA promoter were synthesized by 
a standard PCR method using a FAM-labeled oligonucleotide (Macrogen, Korea) and P . denitrificans genomic 
DNA as template, purified on agarose gel and extracted from the gel (Qiagen). The 250 ng DNA fragment (169 bp) 
was incubated with the recombinant MmsR (0.15, 0.6 and 1.2 µM) for protection at room temperature for 40 sec 
in 10 µl 1X binding buffer which contains 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 750 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM 
EDTA. Protected DNA fragments were digested with 0.05 units of DNase I at room temperature for 30 sec in the 
presence of 1X DNase I buffer, and the digestion reaction was stopped by adding the stop solution containing 
EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 250 mM. Afterwards, the sample was heated to 70 °C and rapidly cooled 
to 4 °C. Denatured DNA fragments were separated on an ABI 3130xl Genetic analyzer (36 cm capillary array and 
POP4 polymer; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). A 1.5 µL of assay product was mixed with 8.3 µL 
of deionized formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 µL of ROX 500 size-standard (Applied Biosystems Inc.), 
the latter of which wasdenatured at 95 °C for 5 min and quenched at 4 °C for 3 min. The mixture was injected into 
capillaries by applying 1.6 KV for 15 sec, and then electrophoresed under 10 kV and an operating temperature of 
60 °C. Data analysis was conducted by GeneMapper software (version 4.1, Applied Biosystems). DNA fragments 
labeled with ROX were used as internal standard (Invitrogen, USA).
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). The 130 bp-long DNA fragments, designated F12, F12M, 
F1M2 and F1M2M, were PCR-amplified (Supplementary Table S2) and purified using a glass fiber column (PCR 
purification kit, Qiagen). EMSA was performed using Molecular Probes’ Fluorescence-based Electrophoretic 
Mobility Shift Assay (fluorescence-EMSA) kit (Invitrogen, E33075), following the standard protocols supplied by 
the manufacturer. Binding reactions were assembled on ice with increasing amounts of purified MmsR protein 
(34.4 kDa) added separately to a fixed concentration (40 nM) of the DNA fragments (F
12, F12M, F1M2 and F1M2M) 
in a final 12 µl volume of 1X binding buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 750 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM 
EDTA). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before loading onto 6% non-denaturating 
polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 200 V in pre-chilled 0.5X TBE buffer (44.5 mM Tris base, 44.5 mM boric 
acid, 0.5 mM EDTA; pH~8) for 30 min. The gel was fixed and stained with SYBR Green EMSA stain for DNA 
observation or SYPRO Ruby EMSA stain for protein observation, before quantification on a gel documentation 
system (Bio-Rad systems).
Statistical analysis. Values form RNA transcription level or fluorescence (AU/OD600) were confirmed by 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) with tukey post hoc comparisons for each dependent variable at 95% of 
confidence interval.
