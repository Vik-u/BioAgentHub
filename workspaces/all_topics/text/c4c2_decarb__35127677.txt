Malonic acid is used as a common component of many products and processes in the
pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Here, we designed a novel artiﬁcial synthetic
pathway of malonic acid, in which oxaloacetate, an intermediate of cytoplasmic reductive
tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway, is converted to malonic semialdehyde and then to
malonic acid, sequentially catalyzed bya-keto decarboxylase and malonic semialdehyde
dehydrogenase. After the systematic screening, we discovered the enzyme oxaloacetate
decarboxylase Mdc, catalyzing theﬁrst step of the artiﬁcially designed pathwayin vitro.
Then, this synthetic pathway was functionally constructed in cellulolytic thermophilic
fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. After enhancement of glucose uptake, the titer of
malonic acid achieved 42.5 mg/L. This study presents a novel biological pathway for
producing malonic acid from renewable resources in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Malonic acid, formally known as propanedioic acid, is widely used in manufacturing processes, such
as the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Traditionally, malonic acid is
produced from fossil resources via petrochemical processes. The byproduct sodium cyanide is
dangerous and unfriendly to the environment (Hildbrand and Pollak, 2012; Werpy et al., 2004;
Klikar et al., 2017). With increasing concerns on energy and environmental problems, the production
of malonic acid by microbial fermentationvia bioconversion of renewable feedstock has generated
considerable interest worldwide. However, due to a lack of knowledge about the malonic acid
synthesis pathway, there is little progress on the biological production of malonic acid.
Recent advances in synthetic biology and computational biology have enabled designing novel and
speciﬁc metabolic pathways for desired chemicals (Atsumi et al., 2008). However, importing and
overexpressing non-native pathways in microbes may lead to metabolic imbalance, resulting in none
or low titer of target products. It is critical to design artiﬁcial synthetic pathways that are compatible with
the host. At present, two non-natural metabolic pathways have been sought and introduced into microbes,
using malonic semialdehyde (MSA) or malonyl-CoA as the precursor (Table 1)( Song et al., 2016; Dietrich
et al., 2017; Chae et al., 2020). Theﬁrst one uses MSA from the deamination reaction ofβ-alanine as the
precursor. In Escherichia coli, β-alanine pyruvate transaminase fromPseudomonas aeruginosawas
overexpressed to convertβ-alanine to produce MSA. Then, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
encoded by E. coli yneI was used to catalyze the reaction of MSA to malic acid, and the titer of
malonic acid reached 3.60 g/L by fed-batch fermentation (Song et al., 2016). Another pathway is dependent

on the fatty acid synthesis pathway, using malonyl-CoA as the
precursor. Matthew et al. repor ted that acyl-CoA hydrolase
encoded by ehd3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiaecan hydrolyze
malonyl-CoA to malonic acid. During overexpression ofEHD3 in
S. cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii,a n dE. coli, malonic acid in the
cultures was detectable. After improvement of binding afﬁnity of
acyl-CoA hydrolase to malonyl-CoA by protein engineering,
production of malonic acid was increased to 0.0823 g/L by
engineered E. coli (Dietrich et al., 2017). Both current synthetic
pathways of malonic acid require a number of enzymes to
convert glucose to target acid and are complex, which might lead
to a low titer of malonic acid. So more research is needed to improve
the production of this dicarboxylic acid, including novel biosynthetic
pathway design, key enzymatic engineering, and even
alternative hosts.
Filamentous fungi are classical predominant microorganisms
for organic acid production, such as citric acid, malic acid, and
lactic acid (Dave and Punekar, 2015; Kirimura et al., 2016; Li
et al., 2020a ). The thermophilic ﬁlamentous fungus
Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym: Thermothelomyces
thermophilus), possessing the ability to ef ﬁciently degrade
plant biomass, represents a potential library of new industrial
applications, including producing thermo-tolerant and efﬁcient
cellulolytic enzymes and synthesizing biochemicals and biofuels
directly from plant biomass (Berka et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015;
Singh, 2016). M. thermophila has been employed to synthesize
bio-based products, such as malic acid, fumaric acid, and
bioethanol, through metabolic engineering using CRISPR/
CAS9 system (Liu et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a;
Li et al., 2020b). In this study, we designed a novel synthetic
pathway of malonic acid and screened the key enzyme,
oxaloacetate decarboxylase, in vitro . In this pathway,
oxaloacetic acid (OAA) can be converted to MSA and then to
malonic acid and sequentially catalyzed bya-keto decarboxylase
and MSA dehydrogenase. Moreover, this arti ﬁcial synthetic
pathway was functionally constructed in M. thermophila to
produce malonic acid from glucose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and Culture Conditions
M. thermophila ATCC 42464 was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The wild-type strain and its
mutants were grown on Vogel’s minimal medium supplemented
with 2% glucose (MM medium) at 35 °C for approximately
12 days to obtain mature conidia, and antibiotics were added
when needed for transformant screening.
E. coli DH5α and E. coli BL21 (DE3) were cultivated in
Luria– Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of
ampicillin for plasmid selection.
Vector Construction
For overexpressing target genes inE. coli, the codon-optimized
genes encoding oxaloacetate decarboxylase and MSA
dehydrogenase were synthesized by GENEWIZ (Suzhou,
China) and inserted between NdeI and XhoI of the plasmid
pET-21a(+).
For the construction of plasmidsoverexpressing target genes inM.
thermophila, codon-optimizedmdc (XP_013934857.1) fromOgataea
parapolymorpha, under control of the strong constitutive promoter of
Pap ampliﬁed from the plasmid pPk2, was inserted between theBglII
and BamHI sites of pAN52-PtrpC-Bar-PMtgpdA to generate the
vector pAN52-Pap-mdc, using the NEB Gibson Assembly Kit.
Similarly, the PCR fragments of the strong constitutive promoter
of pgk (MYCTH_2316240) fromM. thermophilaand the opening
reading fragment ofyneI from E. coli were inserted between theBglII
and BamHI sites of pAN52-PtrpC-bar-PMtgpdA to generate the
plasmid pAN52-PtrpC-bar-PMtpgk-yneI. Under control of the
strong constitutive promoter ofpgk (MYCTH_2316240) of M.
thermophila, Anmae1 encoding the C4-dicarboxylate transporter
from Aspergillus nigerwere inserted between theBglII andBamHI
sites of pAN52-PtrpC-neo-PMtpgk to form the vector pAN52-
PtrpC-neo-PMtpgk-Anmae1. The PCR fragments of glucose
transporter-encoding genes glt-1 from Neurospora crassa were
inserted between theSpe1a n dBamHI sites of pAN52-PtrpC-bar-
PMtgpdA to generate the plasmid pAN52-PtrpC-bar-PMtgpdA-
Anmae1.
All vectors were constructed usingE. coli DH5α. The target
genes cloned into shuttle vectors were sequenced to verify the
authenticity of the plasmid construction. All the primers used for
plasmid construction are listed inSupplementary Table S1.

ml of ampicillin to an optical density OD600 of 0.4– 0.5. Then,
0.4 mM of isopropyl- β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was
supplemented, and the cells were cultivated at 16°C for 19 h.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, resuspended in
50 mM of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer, and crushed with an
ultrasound crusher. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
collected and loaded onto a Ni
2+-NTA-agarose column pre-
equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mM of TAE (Tris-acetate-
EDTA) buffer, 300 mM of NaCl, and 20 mM of imidazole, pH
7.5). The retained proteins were recovered with elution buffer
(20 mM of Na
2HPO4– NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mM of NaCl, and
500 mM of imidazole). In order to eliminate salt and imidazole,
the eluted fraction wasﬁltered by an ultraﬁltration centrifugal
tube. The puriﬁed protein is stored at−20
°C. The purity of the
enzymes was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate– polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and protein concentration in
supernatants was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit
based on absorbance at 590 nm, using bovine serum albumin as
the standard.
In VitroEnzyme Reaction
To synthesize malonic acid from OAA in vitro, the reaction
mixture (2 ml) containing 50 mM (pH 7.5) of Tris-HCl, 1 mM of
NAD
+, 1 mM of MgSO4, 1 mM of thiamine pyrophosphate
(TPP), excessive puri ﬁed YneI (approximately 40 μl), and
100 μl of puriﬁed Mdc was used. The assay was started by the
addition of 1 mM of OAA and was immediately monitored at
340 nm for 5 min. Subsequently, the reactants were analyzed by
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry
Assay
Samples (reaction products and malonic acid standard) were
dried using a CentriVap vacuum concentrator. Then, the dried
samples were dissolved in 20μl of pyridine solution containing
20 mg/ml of methoxyamine hydrochloride and incubated for
90 min at 30
°C. After that, 50 μl of the MSTFA reagent
(containing 1% TMCS, v/v) was added to the sample aliquots,
mixed well, and then incubated for 1 h at 37
°C. The mixture was
assayed by GC/MS as described previously (Mao et al., 2021).
Analytical Method of Sugar
Residual glucose in the culture was determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a
Waters (Milford, MA, USA) 2414 refractive index detector and an
Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA) at 35
°C. H2SO4 measuring 5 mM was employed as the
mobile phase with a constant ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Data
analysis was performed using the Waters e2695 separation
module.
Transformation ofMyceliophthora
Protoplasts
Polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation ofM. thermophila
protoplasts was performed as described previously (Liu et al.,
2017). For gene overexpression, 10 µg of linearized plasmid was
co-transformed intoM. thermophilaprotoplasts, and an antibody
was employed for transformant selection on a plate as needed.
The putative transformants were selected with antibodies and
followed by sequential identiﬁcation via PCR with paired primers
(Supplementary Table S1).
Malonate-Production Medium
Shaken-ﬂask cultivation was performed with 50 ml of medium
inoculated with mature spores at aﬁnal concentration of 2.5× 105
spores/ml in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks. The culture was
incubated at 45°C with shaking at 150 rpm, and the sample
(1 ml) was taken at different intervals. Each liter of the
cultivation medium contained 20 g of glucose, 0.15 g of
KH
2PO4, 0.15 g of K2HPO4, 0.1 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g of
CaCl2·2H2O, 8 g of Bacto peptone, 1 ml of biotin (0.1 g/L),
and 1 ml of trace elements of Vogel’s salt and was sterilized by
autoclaving. Subsequently, sterilized CaCO 3 was used as a
neutralizing agent at a ﬁnal concentration of 20 g/L to keep
the pH at approximately 6.0.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design of an Artiﬁcial Biosynthetic Pathway
of Malonic Acid
An o v e la r t iﬁcial biosynthetic route was devised to produce malonic
acid with OAA as the substrate. In this route, OAA is converted to
MSA by a-keto decarboxylase (Kdc) and then to malonic acid
(Figure 1A). Kdc is the crucial enzyme step required to divert
ﬂux from OAA to malonic acid, which is widespread in plants,
yeasts, and fungi. Kdc has been widely used in the non-native
synthetic pathway of biofuels, in which Kdc converted 2-keto
acids from amino acid biosynthesis pathways to aldehyde and
then catalyzed by dehydrogenase toproduce alcohols, including 1-
propanol, 1-butanol, and isobutanol (Atsumi et al., 2008). Substantial
numbers of Kdc have been identiﬁed and characterized. Moreover,
the protein engineering and method of high-throughput screening
have been developed to improve the thermostability, substrate
speciﬁcity, and activity of Kdc. Therefore, it was possible toﬁnd a
Kdc to catalyze OAA to MSA. In addition, another key enzyme MSA
dehydrogenase has been screened, and succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase encoded byyneI from E. coli has been used for
catalyzing MSA to malonic acid (Fuhrer et al., 2007; Sullivan and
Holyoak, 2007; Zheng et al., 2013; Song et al., 2016). Therefore, the
novel pathway for synthesizing malonic acid was theoretically
feasible.
In microbes, OAA is the intermediate of the cytoplasmic reductive
tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway and mitochondrial TCA cycle.
Assuming that glucose is channeled to OAAvia the glycolysis
pathway and rTCA pathway in turn, 1 mol of glucose produces
2 mol of OAA and 2 mol of NADH, accompanied byﬁxation of
2 mol of CO
2 via carboxylation of pyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate
carboxylase. The formed 2 mol of OAA can be converted to 2 mol of
malonic acid and 2 mol of NADH. In total, 1 mol of glucose produces
2 mol of malonic acid and 4 mol of NADH, by which it achieves the
theoretical maximum yield of 2 mol/mol of glucose (Figure 1B). The

energy metabolites.
Synthesis of Malonic Acid by Artiﬁcial
Synthetic RouteIn Vitro
TPP-dependent keto decarboxylase (Kdc) is a critical enzyme in
malonic acid production, and some members have been used for the
production of keto acid-derived alcohols (Iding et al., 1998). During
the reaction of decarboxylation of OAA,β-carboxylate is easier to be
replaced by hydrogen atom thana-carboxylate, which might result in
difﬁculty of mining the highly active enzyme (Sullivan and Holyoak,
2007). To test the capability of using OAA as a substrate,ﬁve Kdc
candidates, including Thi3, Aro10 fromS. cerevisiae(Vuralhan et al.,
2003), Pdc fromClostridium acetobutylicum(Iding et al., 1998), Kivd
from Lactococcus lactis (Plaza et al., 2004), and Mdc from O.
parapolymorpha, together with succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase-encoding YneI fromE. coli, were heterologously
overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as an N-terminal His*6-
tagged protein. After induction of protein expression, the target
proteins were puriﬁed and characterized. The NADH-coupled
enzyme assay was chosen for the characterization of these puriﬁed
Kdc enzymes (Figures 2A,B). As shown inFigure 2C,t h eo n l y
reaction mixture containing Mdc and excessive YneI exhibited
increased absorbance at 340 nm. GC/MS analysis further revealed
that puriﬁed Mdc and YneI catalyzed OAA to produce malonic acid
(Figure 3), and the concentration of malonic acid was up to 8.1 mg/L.
These data indicated that Mdc had the ability to catalyze OAA to
MSA and the speciﬁc activity achieved 9.37μmol/min/g (Figure 2D).
In vitro multi-enzyme system has emerged as a promising bio-
manufacturing platform for producing desired products (Sun
et al., 2019). The artiﬁcial biosynthetic pathway, including only
two enzymes, may be feasible to produce malonic acidin vitroin
the future.
In order to obtain oxaloacetate decarboxylase with high
activity, 40 orthologs of Mdc were further chosen from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database by protein Blast with the protein sequence of Mdc as
the query and tested for its activity of oxaloacetate decarboxylase
(Supplementary Table S2). Disappointingly, none of these 40
members possessed the ability to catalyze OAA to MSA.
The Artiﬁcial Malonate Biosynthetic
Pathway Can Function inMyceliophthora
thermophila
Thermophilic fungusM. thermophilahas been engineered to produce
C4-dicarboxylic acids, malic acid,and fumaric acid, by cytoplasmic
rTCA pathway (Gu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020a), which can provide
precursor OAA for producing malonic acid. Therefore, in order to
t e s tw h e t h e rt h i sa r t iﬁcial malonic pathway can functionin vivo, both
mdc and yneI were integrated into the genome ofM. thermophila
wild-type strain, under the control of the strong constitutive
promoters of ap (transcriptional enhancer factor) and pgk,
respectively (Figure 4A). After conﬁrmation via PCR analysis, the
engineered strains were tested for the production of malonic acid with
glucose as the carbon source. Malonic acid in the culture of the strain
of SG214 was detected by GC/MS assay, and the titer achieved
40.8 mg/L (Figure 4B), indicating that the artiﬁcial malonate
synthetic pathway we designed can work functionallyin vivo.I t

Gu et al. Artiﬁcial Pathway for Malonic Acid Production
presented a promising approach to produce malonic acid direct from
renewable plant cell biomass in this cellulolytic thermophilic fungus
in the future.
No Obvious Improvement was Obtained by
Overexpression of Glucose Transporter and
a Predicted Exporter of Malonic Acid
Rapid substrate supply was recognized as one strategy to maintain a
high ﬂux of reaction, which is a prerequisite for efﬁcient cell factory
production of biochemicals. Glucose transporter geneglt-1 from N.
crassahas been systematically characterized and used for improving
the production of commodity chemicals, such as malic acid and
ethanol (Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b).
Therefore, to improve the malonic acid production, geneglt-1 was
incorporated into theM. thermophilaSG214 strain, under the strong
constitutive promoter of gpdA (MYCTH_2311855). After
conﬁrmation of the presence of the transgene by PCR analysis,
the production of malonic acid by resultant strain SG317 was
assayed. As shown in Figures 4B,C, the introduction of glt-1
enabled faster glucose utilization and malonate production, while
titer of malonic acid (42.5 mg/L) exhibited a slight increase compared
with the parental strain SG214 (Figure 4B). These data suggested that
glucose absorbability is not the keybottleneck for the current version
of the cell factory, and other strategies are needed to increase the
production of malonic acid.
Previous research on metabolic engineering of chemical products
showed that effective export of target products is the key factor of
efﬁcient production of desirable products, and overexpression of
exporters leads to the improved synthesis of organic acids, such as
malic and fumaric acid (Chen et al., 2017). It was reported previously
that Anmae1, a C4-dicarboxylate transporter fromA. niger,h a st h e
capability to export malonic acid, and it has been introduced intoP.
kudriavzeviifor increased malonate production (Dietrich et al., 2017).
Disappointingly, when the geneAnmae1 was overexpressed in the
strain of SG214, under the control of the constitutive promoter ofpgk
(MYCTH_2316240), malonic acid production (41.3 mg/L) and
glucose consumption rate by the resultant strain SG425 showed
no signiﬁcant increase, compared with the parent strain.
In order to improve the performance of cell factories for malonic
acid production, more strategies of metabolic modiﬁcation would be
needed in the future, such as improvement of activity of key enzymes,
disruption of branch points of the synthetic pathway, and
enhancement of precursor pool size. In addition, intracellular high

concentrations of malonate can competitively inhibit succinate
dehydrogenase activity, which would lead to metabolic disturbance
of host cells. Increasing host cell tolerance to malonate may be
another strategy for the efﬁcient production of malonic acid.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we designed a novel artiﬁcial pathway for malonic acid
biosynthesis with OAA as the substrate. The pathway wasﬁrst tested
in vitro. OAA can be converted to MSA bya-keto decarboxylase
(Mdc) and then to malonic acid by the second enzyme (YneI). Then,
using a cellulolytic fungusM. thermophilaas the host, this novel
pathway was functionally constructedin vivo. The present study
provides a new potential option to produce malonic acid from
glucose and even plant biomass in the future.
