Abstract
Background/Objectives: The possibility of progressive liver fibrosis remains even when
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are <30 IU/L. Therefore, we aimed to investigate fac-
tors that can predict fibrosis progression in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L. Methods: This multicenter
retrospective cohort study was conducted using data collected between December 1994 and
December 2021. Among the 1381 patients with MASLD (CLIONE study) who underwent
liver biopsy, we performed decision-tree analysis on factors for stage ≥ 3 in 115 with ALT
levels ≤ 30 U/L. Of the 818 patients with MASLD (Kawasaki cohort) who underwent
liver biopsy, we included 174 with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L for validation. Results: In the
decision-tree analysis of patients with stage ≥ 3 with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L, 57% of patients
with a fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index ≥ 2.67 and 70% with both FIB-4 index ≥ 2.67 and type-2
diabetes mellitus (DM) were detected. However, no cases of stage ≥ 3 were observed
among patients without type-2 DM with ALT ≤ 30 U/L and a FIB-4 index < 2.67. After
verifying the decision-tree analysis, the model construction and validation datasets showed
a close correlation. Conclusions: Among patients with MASLD with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L,
those with an FIB-4 index ≥ 2.67, particularly with comorbid type-2 DM, should consider
consultation with a hepatologist.

1. Introduction
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common
chronic liver disease (CLD), and its prevalence has recently increased [1,2]. Consequently,
early detection of patients with MASLD with poor prognosis is important, and collaboration
between primary care physicians and specialists is necessary.
The Japan Society of Hepatology defines alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels > 30 U/L
as a criterion for referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist [ 3]. ALT is an enzyme
abundantly present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and serum ALT levels are an important
indicator reflecting liver inflammation and damage in patients with CLD. The usefulness
of “ALT value > 30 U/L” in patients with MASLD has also been reported and verified [4].
However, patients with MASLD with progressive fibrosis may have ALT levels≤ 30 U/L.
Therefore, we aimed to investigate factors that can predict fibrosis progression in patients
with MASLD with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L.
2. Methods
2.1. Patients
The CLIONE study included 115 patients with MASLD with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L
of the 1381 with MASLD (age, 63 [range, 28–78] years; male, 29%; liver fibrosis stage
0/1/2/3/4: 40/39/17/13/6, respectively) who underwent liver biopsy at multiple centers
between December 1994 and December 2020.

In contrast, the validation study included 174 patients with MASLD with ALT
levels ≤ 30 U/L of the 818 with MASLD (age, 61 [range, 18–81] years; male, 39%; liver
fibrosis stage 0/1/2/3/4: 38/59/34/34/9, respectively) (Kawasaki cohort) who underwent
liver biopsy at Kawasaki Medical School General Medical Center between April 1996 and
March 2024 (Table 1).

2.2. Procedure
Background factors and blood tests (age, sex, type-2 diabetes mellitus [type-2 DM],
hypertension, dyslipidemia, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST],γ-glutamyl transpep-
tidase, total cholesterol, platelet count, albumin, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting
blood sugar [FBS], and fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] index) were compared among the 289 patients
with MASLD with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L in both cohorts combined. In addition, decision-
tree analysis was performed for stage ≥ 3 factors among 115 patients with MASLD with
ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L in the CLIONE study, and 174 patients with MASLD with ALT
levels ≤ 30 U/L in the Kawasaki cohort were used to validate the decision-tree analysis.
The MASLD criteria [5] include the presence of steatotic liver disease and the absence of
other liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or C virus infection, autoimmune liver disease, drug-
induced liver injury, and metabolic liver disease. Individuals with a history of low alcohol
consumption (male, <30 g/day; female, <20 g/day) and those with at least one of the fol-
lowing five risk factors for heart disease were considered: (1) body massindex ≥ 23 kg/m2
or waist circumference of ≥94 cm for males and ≥80 cm for females; (2) elevated FBS level
(≥100 mg/dL), 2-h postprandial blood sugar levels ≥ 140 mg/dL, HbA1c level ≥ 5.7%,
and type-2 DM/use of antidiabetic drugs; (3) high blood pressure ( ≥135/85 mmHg) or
use of antihypertensive drugs; (4) elevated triglyceride levels ( ≥150 mg/dL) or use of
lipid-improving drugs; and (5) low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≤40 and
≤50 mg/dL for males and females, respectively). The FIB-4 index was calculated as AST
(IU/L) × age (years)/platelet count (109/L) × ALT (IU/L) [6].

2.3. Liver Biopsy and Histological Analysis
All liver biopsies were performed using a 16- or 17-gauge biopsy needle under ultra-
sound guidance or a 14-gauge needle under laparoscopic guidance. After the specimens
were fixed in 10% formalin and sectioned, they were stained with Azan and hematoxylin–
eosin stains. MASLD stage of liver tissue, lobular inflammation, steatosis, and hepato-
cellular ballooning grades were determined according to the Brunt and Kleiner classifica-
tion [7,8]. Histological parameters included fibrosis, inflammation, steatosis, hepatocyte
ballooning, and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS). The NAS scoring
system includes lobular inflammation (grades 0–3), steatosis (grades 0–3), and hepato-
cellular ballooning (grades 0–2) [7,8]. Furthermore, the liver fibrosis stage was assessed
according to the Brunt criteria [7]. Two experienced liver pathologists blinded to patient
details conducted the histological examinations.
2.4. Statistical Analyses
The JMP software version 16.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for
the decision-tree analysis. Specifically, the software searched the analytical database for
the factor that most effectively predicted stage ≥ 3. The patients were categorized into
two groups (stages 0–2/3–4) according to that predictor. Each group was repeatedly
assessed and classified according to this two-choice branching method. For each group,
median values were calculated using continuous variables, and comparisons between
the two groups were performed using t-tests. Finally, a stage ≥ 3 prediction model was
created. The suitability and reproducibility of the model were validated by comparing the
stage ≥ 3 development rates between the model–derivation and validation groups.
The decision-tree analysis included clinical parameters that showed significant differ-
ences between stages 0–2 and 3–4. Cutoff values were determined using the Gini coefficient.
We used the observed values for quantitative variables, and branching was based on the
values deemed optimal. For univariate analyses, Student’s t-test and Fisher’s exact test
were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Logistic regression was
used for multivariate analysis, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
The study protocol complied with the guidelines outlined in the 1975 Helsinki Decla-
ration (as revised in Fortaleza, Brazil, in October 2013). This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Saga University and Kawasaki Medical School (approval nos.
2020-04-R-02 and 3864).
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of Patients with MASLD and Fibrosis Stages 3–4 vs. 0–2 with ALT
Levels ≤ 30 U/L
Among the 1381 patients with MASLD, 115 had ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L, and stage ≥ 3
was observed in 19 (17%). In the Kawasaki cohort, which was considered a validation study
group, 174 of the 818 patients with MASLD had ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L, and stage ≥ 3 was
observed in 43 (24%). Univariate analysis revealed that 289 patients with MASLD with
ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L in both cohorts were older than those with stages 0–2, with significant
differences in age, type-2 DM, hypertension, AST levels, platelet counts, albumin levels,
HbA1c levels, and the FIB-4 index. In the multivariate analysis, age≥ 65 years, the presence
of type-2 DM and hypertension were significant factors (Tables 2 and 3).

3.2. Decision-Tree Analysis of Stage≥ 3 in Patients with MASLD with ALT Levels≤ 30 U/L
The Gini coefficients for the FIB-4 index cutoff values of 2.67, 2.5, 2.3, and 3.0 were
0.169629, 0.156343, 0.177281, and 0.189256, respectively. Although the FIB-4 index cutoff
value of 2.5 had a better Gini coefficient than that of 2.67, we used the cutoff value of 2.67
because it is better known than 2.5. In the CLIONE study, the decision-tree analysis of
patients with stage ≥ 3 with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L showed that the FIB-4 index > 2.67 was
the most promising factor, followed by the presence of type-2 DM. The FIB-4 index > 2.67
was found in 57% of the patients, and the FIB-4 index > 2.67 and the presence of type-2 DM
were detected in 70%.
Meanwhile, no stage≥ 3 cases were observed among patients with ALTlevels ≤ 30 U/L,
a FIB-4 index ≤ 2.67, and no type-2 DM (Figure 1); the same was true for the Kawasaki
cohort examined for validation (Figure 2). The validation of the decision-tree analysis
showed a close correlation between the model-building and validation datasets (correlation
coefficient r2 = 0.8997; Figure 3). In addition, the model-building group was more discrimi-
native and stable than the validation group as verified using the correlation between the
cumulative number of cases (%) and the cumulative incidence of fibrosis stage ≥ 3 (%)
(Figure 4).

4. Discussion
Recently, advancement in viral hepatitis treatment has led to a decline in the preva-
lence of viral liver diseases associated with elevated ALT levels, such as hepatitis B and
C [9]. However, an increasing trend has been observed in the number of patients with
lifestyle-related diseases [9], such as steatosis and alcohol-related liver disease. Patients
with MASLD and mildly elevated ALT levels are frequently overlooked despite their high
risk of fibrosis. In patients with ALT levels > 30 U/L, obesity, type-2 DM, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, or steatotic liver disease, along with a platelet count ≤ 200,000 or FIB-4
index ≥ 1.3 is used to predict advanced fibrosis [3], and consultation with a gastroenterol-
ogist and hepatologist is recommended. Therefore, this requires educating physicians
who are not hepatologists regarding the kind of cases to refer to a gastroenterologist
and hepatologist.
The prevalence of MASLD has been reported to be higher in patients with elevated ALT
levels, particularly in those with ALT levels > 30 U/L in the Japan Society of Hepatology
guideline [3]. In our study, we found that in patients with MASLD who underwent liver
biopsy, the detection of stage ≥ 2 fibrosis development was possible in 76–94% of cases
by lowering the ALT threshold from >50 to >30 U/L. In addition, the prevalence of stage
≥2 fibrosis development was higher in patients with MASLD who underwent liver biopsy
than in all patients who underwent liver biopsy. Patients with elevated ALT levels among
those with MASLD have a higher risk of liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis than those
without elevated ALT levels, and changes in ALT levels are associated with alterations in
liver histology [10].
However, finding predictive factors for fibrosis development, even in patients with
ALT levels ≤ 30 IU/L, is important. Gawrieh et al. [11] reported that approximately 10–20%
of the patients with ALT levels ≤30 or ≤40 U/L had fibrosis. Liver biopsies of 330 patients
with type-2 DM with sustained ALT levels >20 and >30 U/L in females and males, respec-
tively, showed that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and cirrhosis
are present in 58% and 10% of cases, respectively, indicating that even cases with low ALT
levels have fibrosis progression [12].
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance states
that ALT levels are frequently normal in cases of fibrosis progression in MASH and should
Diagnostics 2025, 15, 1591 8 of 10
not be used alone to rule out the presence of MASH with clinically significant fibrosis [13].
Therefore, given the reports of fibrosis development even with ALT levels≤30 U/L, we
predicted cases of liver fibrosis development among patients with MASLD with ALT levels
≤ 30 U/L. In this study, stage ≥ 3 was observed in 63 (22%) of the 289 MASLD cases with
ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L.
Here, 54–57% of patients with MASLD with ALT levels ≤30 U/L had a FIB-4 index
>2.67 in both CLIONE and Kawasaki studies, and 64–70% of those with MASLD in both
studies had a FIB-4 index >2.67 and type-2 DM. The cases of fibrosis development could
be detected. However, the cases of fibrosis in patients with ALT levels ≤30 U/L, a FIB-4
index ≤ 2.67, and no type-2 DM were few, indicating that confirming the FIB-4 index and
presence of type-2 DM in patients with MASLD with ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L is important.
This study had some limitations. First, we used a hospital-based cohort to examine the
association with histopathological findings. In future studies, validation in a health checkup
cohort and non-liver-biopsy cases (patients who underwent magnetic resonance elastogra-
phy and other similar assessments) should be conducted. Second, the database used in this
study does not include imaging findings or medication history of the patients. Therefore,
the reasons for the ALT levels ≤ 30 U/L during liver biopsy may include mild fibrosis,
mild inflammation, and progressive fibrosis. Third, as a retrospective study with a long
inclusion period, there may have been variability in clinical decisions and biopsy indica-
tions. However, all liver specimens were evaluated by two experienced hepatopathologists
using consistent histological criteria, which reduced diagnostic variability and enhanced
the reliability of the histological assessments.
In this study, some patients underwent liver biopsy despite having ALT levels
≤ 30 U/L. Although imaging data and medication history were not available in the
database, a biopsy was typically considered when there was clinical suspicion of advanced
fibrosis or steatohepatitis based on metabolic risk factors, laboratory data, or non-invasive
assessments. These factors likely contributed to the clinical decision to proceed with
histological evaluation, even in the presence of normal ALT levels.
5. Conclusions
The ALT level proposed in the Nara Declaration 2023 can better detect cases of MASLD
with fibrosis and predict MASLD with fibrosis with a worse prognosis when combined with
platelet count and the FIB-4 index. Among patients with MASLD with ALTlevels ≤ 30 U/L,
those with a FIB-4 index > 2.67, particularly with comorbid type-2 DM, should be referred
to a hepatologist.
