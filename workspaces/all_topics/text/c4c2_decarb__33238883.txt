Sex-dimorphic neuroestradiol regulation 
of ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus 
glucoregulatory transmitter and glycogen 
metabolism enzyme protein expression 
in the rat
Md. Main Uddin, Mostafa M. H. Ibrahim and Karen P . Briski* 
Abstract 
Background: Ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) gluco-regulatory transmission is subject to sex-specific 
control by estradiol. The VMN is characterized by high levels of aromatase expression.
Methods: The aromatase inhibitor letrozole (LZ) was used with high-resolution microdissection/Western blot 
techniques to address the hypothesis that neuroestradiol exerts sex-dimorphic control of VMN neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase (nNOS) and glutamate  decarboxylase65/67 (GAD) protein expression. Glycogen metabolism impacts VMN 
nNOS and GAD profiles; here, LZ treatment effects on VMN glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase brain- (GPbb; 
glucoprivic-sensitive) and muscle (GPmm; norepinephrine-sensitive) variant proteins were examined.
Results: VMN aromatase protein content was similar between sexes. Intracerebroventricular LZ infusion of testes-
intact male and ovariectomized, estradiol-replaced female rats blocked insulin-induced hypoglycemic (IIH) up-
regulation of this profile. LZ exerted sex-contingent effects on basal VMN nNOS and GAD expression, but blocked 
IIH-induced NO stimulation and GAD suppression in each sex. Sex-contingent LZ effects on basal and hypoglycemic 
patterns of GPbb and GPmm expression occurred at distinctive levels of the VMN. LZ correspondingly down- or up-
regulated baseline pyruvate recycling pathway marker protein expression in males (glutaminase) and females (malic 
enzyme-1), and altered INS effects on those proteins.
Conclusions: Results infer that neuroestradiol is required in each sex for optimal VMN metabolic transmitter signal-
ing of hypoglycemic energy deficiency. Sex differences in VMN GP variant protein levels and sensitivity to aromatase 
may correlate with sex-dimorphic glycogen mobilization during this metabolic stress. Neuroestradiol may also exert 
sex-specific effects on glucogenic amino acid energy yield by actions on distinctive enzyme targets in each sex.

aling [15, 29]. Central ERs are stimulated by estradiol of 
systemic and local origin. Neuroestradiol is generated 
in the brain by aromatase enzyme-catalyzed conversion 
from testosterone. Aromatase protein expression varies 
within the brain, with highest tissue content observed 
in distinct structures that include the medial preoptic 
area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial 
hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), and medial amygdala [22, 
27, 31]. Aromatase is implicated in male socio-sexual 
behavior [33] and female sexual behavior and reproduc

AMP [25]. GPmm and -bb are both expressed in astro

GPmm or GPbb, whereas GPbb exhibits greater affinity

Experimental design
Animals of each sex (male: M; female: F) were randomly 
assigned to one of four treatment groups (Table  1). All 
surgeries were performed in a dedicated surgical suite in 
the College of Pharmacy Vivarium, adjacent to housing 
quarters. Animal health and welfare status was checked 
daily by investigators and Vivarium management over 
the duration of the experiment. On day 1, female rats 
were bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under ketamine/
xylazine anesthesia (0.1  mL/100  g bw; 90  mg ketamine: 
10  mg xylazine/mL; Henry Schein Inc., Melville, NY)

day 11, rats were selected by random order from a single 
treatment group for sc injection of sterile insulin diluent 
(V; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN) or neutral protamine 
Hagedorn insulin (INS, 10.0 U/kg bw; Henry Schein), in 
the absence of anesthesia. To maintain uniform timing 
between sc injection and sacrifice (+1 h) throughout the 
experiment, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 
at 10.00, 10.10, or 10.20 h for blood collection by cardiac 
puncture, then immediately sacrificed by focused micro

VMN tissue micropunch dissection and western blot 
analysis
Each brain was cut into consecutive 100  μm-thick fro -
zen sections through the VMN between − 2.00 and 
− 3.3  mm posterior to bregma. Bilateral micropunches 
of VMN tissue taken from sections cut at rostral (− 2.0 
to − 2.3 mm), middle (− 2.5 to − 2.8), and caudal (− 3.0 
to − 3.3 mm) levels of the VMN were pooled according 
to region in lysis buffer [16] for Western blot analysis. 
Within each treatment group, heat-denatured tissue ali

quots from each subject were combined within rostral, 
middle, and caudal VMN regions to create sextuplicate 
sample pools for each protein of interest. Tissue sample 
pools were separated in Bio-Rad TGX 10% stain-free gels

On the other hand, female animals injected with insulin 
exhibited augmented rostral and middle, but not caudal 
VMN aromatase protein levels [V/INS-F versus V/V-F]; 
hypoglycemic up-regulation of this profile was averted 
at each VMN level by Lz [Lz/INS-F versus V/INS-F]. As 
shown in Table 3, plasma glucose levels were significantly 
decreased in either sex in response to INS injection; 
this response was not impaired by Lz. Full-length blots

tively prevented adjustments in GAD expression at each 
level of the female VMN.
Figure 4 describes effects of icv Lz on basal and hypo -
glycemic patterns of VMN GS protein expression in 
male and female rats. Baseline VMN GS protein levels 
were greater in rostral and middle VMN region in males 
compared to females [V/V-M versus V/V-F], yet GS con

tent was higher in the female versus male caudal VMN. 
Lz regulation of GS content was VMN region-specific 
adjustments in each sex, as this treatment diminished GS 
profiles in the rostral male VMN or caudal female VMN, 
but increased GS content at caudal or middle levels of the 
male or female VMN, respectively. Insulin suppressed GS 
protein expression in the middle region of the male VMN 
and in the caudal female VMN. Lz deterred hypoglycemic 
inhibition of VMN GS protein expression in female, but 
not male rats. Data presented in Fig.  5 show that baseline 
GPmm protein expression was relatively greater in the 
male rostral and caudal VMN compared to females. Out

comes disclose that Lz infusion diminished VMN GPmm 
profiles in the rostral male VMN and in the rostral and 
middle VMN in females. Insulin injection suppressed 
GPmm expression in the rostral and caudal VMN in 
males; this inhibitory response was averted by Lz in the 
rostral, but not caudal VMN. Hypoglycemia-associated 
suppression of GPmm protein was observed throughout 
the rostro-caudal extent of the female VMN; Lz abolished 
this decline in the rostral and caudal VMN, but not in the 
middle region. Figure  6 illustrates eu- versus hypoglyce
-
mic patterns of VMN GPbb protein expression in Lz-pre-
treated male and female rats. Baseline GPbb content was 
higher in the male middle VMN compared to females. 
Data indicate that Lz inhibited caudal VMN GPbb pro
-
files in the males, but did not modify VMN GPbb con -
tent in female animals. Insulin injection increased GPbb 
expression throughout the male VMN; this stimulatory 
response was alleviated by Lz. Insulin-injected female 
rats exhibited amplified rostral and caudal VMN GPbb 
content, alongside a decline in this protein profile in the 
middle VMN.
Data presented in Fig. 7 depict Lz effects on VMN GLT 
protein expression in eu- versus hypoglycemic male and 
female rats. Baseline GLT content was higher in the male 
rostral and middle VMN compared to females. Lz sup
-
pressed baseline GLT profiles in the male VMN (middle 
region), but did not modify protein content in the female 
VMN. Insulin-injected male rats exhibited elevated GLT 
content in the rostral and middle VMN, whereas females 
showed GLT up-regulation in the middle and caudal 
VMN in response to that treatment. This stimulatory 
response was prevented by Lz in male, but not female 
rats. As shown in Fig.  8, basal ME-1 content was higher 
in the female rostral VMN compared to male rats. Lz 
did not affect baseline VMN ME-I protein expression in 
males, but either reduced (rostral VMN) or increased 
(middle and caudal VMN) this profile in females. Insu
-
lin treatment elevated ME-1 content of the male rostral 
and middle VMN; Lz did not prevent these stimulatory 
responses. Female rat VMN ME-1 profiles were refrac

Discussion
The VMN is a prominent site of aromatase expression in 
the brain. Here, microdissected VMN tissue from male 
and female rats infused icv with the aromatase inhibitor 
LZ prior to sc vehicle or insulin injection was analyzed 
by Western blot to address the premise that forebrain-
generated estradiol controls VMN glucoregulatory meta
-
bolic signaling, glycogen accumulation and mobilization, 
and utilization of alternative non-glucose energy fuels in 
a sex-specific manner. IIH elicited Lz-reversible, region-
specific adjustments in VMN aromatase expression in 
each sex. LZ caused sex-dimorphic effects on VMN 
nNOS and GAD profiles in euglycemic animals, but pre

within distinct rostro-caudal VMN levels in each sex. 
Sex-contingent LZ effects on basal and hypoglycemic 
patterns of GPbb and GPmm expression were observed 
at specific VMN levels. LZ correspondingly down- or up-
regulated baseline pyruvate recycling pathway marker 
protein expression in males (GLT) and females (ME-1), 
and altered hypoglycemic regulation of these proteins. 
Results document neuroestradiol regulation of VMN 
metabolic transmitter signaling of hypoglycemic energy 
deficiency in each sex. Sex-dimorphic GP variant protein 
expression and reactivity to aromatase may correlate with 
differential glycogen mobilization during hypoglycemia. 
Neuroestradiol may also exert sex-contingent control of 
glucogenic amino acid energy yield via action on distinc
-
tive enzyme targets in the male versus female.
Results provide novel proof that, in each sex, aromatase 
enzyme activity enhances basal aromatase protein 
expression and is required for hypoglycemic regulation of 
this protein profile in distinct rostro-caudal segments of 
the VMN. Evidence here for aromatase protein down- or 
up-regulation in the rostral versus middle/caudal male rat 
VMN infers that neuroestradiol signaling during IIH may 
be correspondingly diminished or augmented in rostral 
against other levels of this nucleus. Thus, hypoglycemia 
plausibly amplifies neuroestradiol transmitter volume 
in common as well as dissimilar regions of the VMN in 
the two sexes, as female rats exhibit, unlike males, ampli
-
fied aromatase protein in the rostral and middle VMN. 
High levels of VMN aromatase expression support the 
likelihood that observable drug effects on VMN protein 
endpoints reflect in part direct action on local enzyme 
activity. However, since current studies involved Lz 
delivery by intra-LV infusion, the possibility that demon
-
strable effects of Lz treatment on, including aromatase 
protein content, may reflect in part drug suppression of 
enzyme activity both within and external to the VMN, 
including upstream neural loci that regulate VMN aro
-
matase expression through afferent innervation cannot 
be discounted. Present work did not evaluate Lz treat
-
ment effects on segment-specific VMN tissue aromatase 
activity and estradiol content as quantitative methods of 
requisite sensitivity for measurement of these parameters 
in small-volume tissue samples collected from region-
based VMN microdissection are not currently available. 
Outcomes identify a critical need to characterize the 
molecular mechanisms that achieve segment-specific 
effects of hypoglycemia on VMN aromatase protein pro
-
files in each sex remain unclear. As gonadal steroids con -
trol brain aromatase gene expression and enyzme activity 
over the life span [27, 28, 34], it is possible that ERs may 
mediate, in part, distinctive aromatase responses to this 
metabolic stress in neuroanatomically-defined nerve cell 
populations.
Current research uniquely implicates neuroestradiol 
signaling in IIH patterns of VMN gluco-stimulatory NO 
and gluco-inhibitory GAD neurotransmission. Results 
support involvement, in each sex, of neuroestradiol-
dependent and -independent mechanisms, discernible in 
specific rostro-caudal VMN segments, in hypoglycemic 
augmentation of VMN nNOS profiles. Lz was likewise 
observed to forestall hypoglycemic diminution of VMN 
GAD protein in some (male) or all (female) segments of 
the VMN. Additional effort will be needed to determine 
if hypoglycemia-associated adjustments in neuroestradiol 
production actively elicit changes in these transmitter 
marker protein profiles, or alternatively, if this local hor
-
mone stimulus is a passive requirement, irrespective of 
signal volume, for NO and GABA transmitter responses 
to hypoglycemia. The former scenario is supported by 
observations that, in each sex, regional patterns of hypo
-
glycemic up-regulation of aromatase protein overlap, 
with a single exception, with aromatase activity-depend
-
ent nNOS augmentation and GAD suppression. Current 
data advance the novel premise that neuroestradiol may 
act as a critical acute transmitter targeting VMN glu
-
coregulatory neuron substrates. The current consensus 
is that brain aromatase is expressed primarily in neurons 
[2, 13]. It would be informative to learn if this enzyme is 
present in VMN nitrergic and/or GABAergic nerve cells, 
and to understand if and how hypoglycemic regulation of 
this enzyme protein profile may affect intracellular estra
-
diol content and receptor signaling in each cell type.
Current data indicate that forebrain aromatase activity 
up- or down-regulates baseline VMN GS protein expres -
sion in a rostro-caudal pattern that is unique to each sex. 
Here, IIH was observed to selectively suppress GS protein 
in dissimilar segments of the male (middle) versus female 
(caudal) VMN, an action that presumably curbs glyco
-
gen amassment during hypoglycemia in a sex-dimorphic 
manner. Outcomes further infer that aromatase activity 
is required only in the latter sex for this inhibitory GS 
response. Neuroestradiol signaling is also a putative posi
-
tive stimulus for GPmm protein expression in distinctive 
regions of the male (rostral segment) versus female (ros
-
tral and middle segments) VMN. These results infer that 
aromatase signaling may facilitate NE stimulation of gly
-
cogen mobilization in those distinctive locations under 
euglycemic conditions. Data here document unique 
effects of hypoglycemia on GPmm profiles in each sex, as 
this GP variant was down-regulated in rostral and caudal 
levels of the male VMN, but instead declined in each ana
-
lyzed segment of the female VMN. Hypoglycemic sup -
pression of this NE-responsive GP variant likely reduces 
stimulation of glycogen breakdown by that neurotrans
-
mitter under glucoprivation versus glucostasis. In male 
rats, hypoglycemic suppression of GPmm likely involves 
Page 16 of 18Uddin et al. BMC Neurosci           (2020) 21:51 
neurosteroid-dependent (rostral VMN) and -independ -
ent (caudal VMN) mechanisms; similarly, GPmm dimi -
nution in the female rat VMN was both Lz-reversible 
(rostral and caudal VMN) and -refractory (middle VMN). 
At the same time, aromatase activity had a compara
-
bly minimal effect on baseline VMN GPbb expression 
in each sex. Moreover, GPbb profiles were affected dif
-
ferently by IIH compared to GPmm. For example, male 
rats showed elevated GPbb protein in all three VMN seg
-
ments, whereas females had augmented GPbb expression 
in the rostral and caudal VMN yet decreased GPbb levels 
in the middle VMN. Hypoglycemic up-regulation of this 
energy-sensitive GP variant is postulated to expedite gly
-
cogen mobilization during glucose deficiency. Data here 
suggest that glycogen disassembly may be restricted to 
discrete levels of the female VMN under such conditions. 
Importantly, current outcomes implicate neuroestradiol 
signaling in hypoglycemic patterns of GPbb expression at 
all levels of the VMN in each sex.
Reports on differential cultured astrocyte GPmm and 
GPbb protein reactivity to distinctive physiological stim
-
uli, i.e. NE versus AMP , support a role for these variants 
in stimulus-specific regulation of glycogen metabolism 
[24]. Proof here for dissimilar forebrain aromatase regu

lation of VMN GPmm versus GPbb protein in each sex 
infers that neuroestradiol shapes adjustments in glycogen 
metabolism during energy homeostasis versus imbal

ance. Outcomes here affirm new studies that document 
divergent adjustments in VMN GPmm (down-regulated) 
versus GPbb (up-regulated) profiles in response to hind
-
brain lactoprivation owing to pharmacological inhibition 
of local monocarboxylate transporter function [7]. NE 
links hindbrain dorsal vagal complex metabolic-sensory 
A2 noradrenergic neurons with the VMN and other 
hypothalamic gluco-regulatory loci. A2 neurons are a 
plausible site of detection of energetic sequelae of hypo

uct l-lactate activate the ultra-sensitive energy sensor 
adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) in these cells during hypoglycemia, alongside 
augmentation of hypothalamic norepinephrine levels 
[30]. Hindbrain lactoprivic regulation of VMN GP vari
-
ant protein expression involves NE. Additional research 
is warranted to examine whether hindbrain lactoprivic 
transmitter signals, namely NE, control VMN aromatase 
protein expression and corresponding neuroestradiol 
yield during hypoglycemia. There is also need to eluci
-
date the mechanisms that impose rare-instance bi-direc -
tional neuroestradiol regulatory effects on VMN protein 
endpoints during eu- versus hypoglycemia, including the 
possibility that opposing actions may mediated by adjust
-
ments in steroid signal volume.
A notable outcome of current research is the discov -
ery of sex-dimorphic baseline VMN GS and GP vari -
ant protein expression in the rat. Results indicate that 
basal VMN GS content varied significantly between 
sexes, with males exhibiting relatively higher (ros
-
tral and middle VMN) or lower (caudal) expression 
according to region. Interestingly, male rats showed 
higher baseline GPmm profiles in the rostral and cau
-
dal VMN, but greater middle VMN GPbb content 
compared to females. These data infer that amassed 
VMN glycogen in males may be more sensitive to 
NE- or glucoprivic-mediated glycogenolysis versus the 
female, depending upon VMN segment.
Data here document minimal neuroestradiol involve
-
ment in baseline VMN GLT protein expression in each 
sex, but reveal a stimulatory (rostral VMN) or inhibitory 
(middle and caudal VMN) influence of this stimulus on 
basal ME-1 profiles in female rats. Thus, in the female, 
aromatase activity may enhance or tamper utilization of 
glucogenic amino acids for energy production according 
to discrete VMN segment during energy homeostasis. 
VMN GLT profiles were increased by IIH in a region-
specific manner unique to each sex; amplification of this 
pyruvate recycling pathway marker protein involved aro
-
matase activity in male, but not female rats. It remains 
to be determined, for that sex, if differential neuroestra
-
diol regulation of GLT during eu- versus hypoglycemia 
involves amplified steroid signaling and/or altered recep
-
tivity to that cue. Hypoglycemia augmented ME-1 protein 
expression, by neuroestradiol-independent mechanisms, 
in rostral and middle levels of the male VMN; in females, 
this protein was refractory to IIH. Taken together, these 
results infer that metabolism of non-glucose energy sub
-
strates may be restricted to distinct segments of the male 
VMN during hypoglycemia, and that sex-contingent 
VMN ME-1 reactivity to this metabolic stress may result 
in differential activity of the pyruvate recycling pathway 
in those regions.
Conclusion
Results, summarized in Table  4, infer that neu -
roestradiol is required in each sex for optimal VMN 
metabolic transmitter signaling of hypoglycemic 
energy deficiency. Sex differences in VMN GP vari
-
ant protein levels and sensitivity to aromatase may 
correlated with sex-dimorphic glycogen mobiliza
-
tion during this metabolic stress. Neuroestradiol 
may also exert sex-specific effects on glucogenic 
amino acid energy yield by actions on distinctive 
enzyme targets in each sex.
