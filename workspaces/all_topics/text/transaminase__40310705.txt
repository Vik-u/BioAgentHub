Biosynthesis of Ephedrine Initiated by Pyridoxal
Phosphate-Dependent Formation of Cathinone
Karina Witte, Anne Behrens, Hannes M. Schwelm, Volker Auwärter, and Michael Müller*
Ephedra alkaloids possess some of the most basic structures of
alkaloids. Despite their importance for human use and their com-
mercial relevance, the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has
remained enigmatic. The predominant biosynthetic pathway in
the literature proposes a thiamin-dependent carboligation
followed by a transaminase, although no candidate enzymes
have yet been identified in ephedra alkaloid producers. In this
work, an alternative pathway in plants to ephedra alkaloids via
(S)– cathinone is investigated that circumvents the formation of
1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione as an intermediate and is in full
agreement with previous biosynthetic studies. This alternative
pathway involves the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent carbo-
ligation of– benzoyl-CoA– and L-alanine in a single step. The PLP-
dependent formation of labeled and unlabeled (S)– cathinone is
detected in the plant lysate of young stem tissue of various
Ephedra species that contain Ephedra alkaloids, as well as in young
leaf tissue ofCatha edulis. The incorporation of labeled nitrogen
from L-alanine into (S)-cathinone supports the hypothesis that
an α-oxoamine synthase (AOS) catalyzes the formation of
(S)-cathinone, bypassing the dione as an intermediate. These
results demonstrate the involvement of a PLP-dependent AOS
as a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids.
1. Introduction
Ephedra alkaloids represent an important group of alkaloids such
as cathinone (1), nor(pseudo)ephedrine (2), and (pseudo)ephed-
rine (3). They share a 1– phenylpropan– 2– amine core structure
and contain anα– oxyamine structure as a building block, which
is widely present in a range of indirect sympathomimetic drugs
for medicinal and recreational purposes.[1] Ephedra alkaloids have
been isolated from plants such asEphedra species[2] and Catha
edulis,[3] and their biosynthesis has been studied for more than
six decades using a variety of approaches, including labeled com-
pound incorporation studies and identification and characteriza-
tion of the enzymes involved.[1,4– 7] However, major intermediates
and enzymes remain elusive. Only a SAM-dependent N-methyl-
transferase (PaNMT) has been identified as being involved in the
biosynthesis of ephedrine.[4] In particular, the formation of1 as
the initial ephedra alkaloid in biosynthesis requires further
investigation.[4,8]
Thus far, the prevailing hypothesis is that the formation of1
occurs by transamination from 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione (4).
Grue– Sørensen and Spenser postulated dione4 as a precursor
of ephedra alkaloids formed by a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-
dependent carboligation of pyruvate (5) with benzoic acid (6)o r
benzoyl-CoA (7)( Scheme 1,r o u t eA ) .T h u s ,6 or 7 would be the
precursor of the phenyl ring and C1, and5 the precursor of C2
and C3.[9,10] Moreover, labeling experiments with [13C1,2,3]– 4 sup-
posedly showed incorporation into norephedrine [(1 R,2S)– 2]
and norpseudoephedrine [(1S,2S)– 2]. Incorporation of the label
into pseudoephedrine [(1S,2S)– 3] was low and undetectable for
ephedrine [(1 R,2S)– 3]. Small amounts of labeled ( S)– 1 were
detected.[9,10] Krizevski et al. detected4 and (S)-1 in GC– MS anal-
ysis of freshly harvested young E. sinica stems. However, they
did not detect the carboligation reaction.[11] Furthermore, due
to its reactivity, 4 can also be degraded or nonenzymatically
transaminated to (S)– 1, which can be converted to the other
ephedra alkaloids. Despite tremendous efforts, the putative
ThDP-dependent carboligase and transaminase have not been
identified in plants as yet.[1,4]
α– Oxyamine moieties can be formed via different biosyn-
thetic or biocatalytic pathways. One of these pathways is via
α-oxoamine synthases (AOS), which are pyridoxal 5‘– phosphate
(PLP)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the formation of
α– amino ketones via a Claisen– like condensation. In this process,
a new C─C bond is formed by decarboxylative coupling of amino
acids withα– keto thioesters such as– acyl-CoA– (Scheme 2).[12,13]
We investigated this alternative pathway to (S)– 1 catalyzed by
an AOS, hypothesized to be involved in the biosynthesis of ephe-
dra alkaloids (Scheme 1, route B). This pathway involves the PLP-
dependent– carboligation of– benzoyl-CoA– (7)a n dL– alanine– (8)
in one step, avoiding the formation of dione4 as an intermediate.
An HPLC-MS/MS-based assay was developed to test AOS
activity in plants. Plant samples of young tissue ofCatha edulis

and 14 differentEphedra species were collected from botanical
gardens and analyzed for their ephedra alkaloid content and
AOS activity. The young plant tissue of each plant was freshly har-
vested, lysed with a bead homogenizer, and centrifuged. The
supernatant of the lysate was purified from the ephedra alkaloids
contained in the plant lysate by size exclusion chromatography.
The flow-through was analyzed as a blank for each assay to con-
firm complete removal of the small molecules from the plant
lysate. To distinguish between enzymatic and nonenzymatic
product formation, negative control reactions were performed
with lysate heat inactivated at 95 °C for 20 min. The dependence
of the conversions on PLP was evaluated using plant lysate with
or without PLP after removal of PLP by size exclusion chromatog-
raphy. Subsequently, the PLP-free plant lysate was subjected to
further tests after the reintroduction of PLP.
The formation of (S)– 1 was detected in the plant lysate of
young stem tissue of allEphedra species that contained ephedra
alkaloids and inCatha edulis. No formation or only traces of (S)– 1
were detected in the plant lysate of young stem tissue ofEphedra
species that did not contain ephedra alkaloids. To confirm the
formation of (S)– 1 during the assay via an AOS mechanism,
deuterium-labeled L-alanine ([2,3,3,3– D4]-8) was used, and the for-
mation of (S)– [3,3,3– D3]– 1 was detected (Figure 1C, Scheme 3B).
Nevertheless, the formation of (S)– [3,3,3– D3]– 1 upon addition
of 7 and [2,3,3,3– D4]– 8 to an enzyme or plant lysate is not firm
evidence for the proposed reaction mechanism by an AOS.
Krizevski et al. postulated that benzaldehyde is a precursor of
phenylpropylamino alkaloids. In their studies, they show a ThDP-
dependent carboligase activity in soluble protein preparations
Scheme 1. A) Predominantly postulated biosynthesis in literature: ThDP-
dependent carboligation of pyruvate (5) with benzoic acid (6)o rb e n z o y l - C o A
(7) would result in dione4, which is to be transaminated to cathinone [(S)-1].
B) This work: alternative PLP-dependent biosynthesis to (S)-1. Both pathways
have in common that (S)– 1 undergoes reduction to nor(pseudo)ephedrine (2)
and methylation to (pseudo)ephedrine (3); PaNMT: phenylalkylamine
N-methyltransferase.[1,4]

from E. sinicaand E. foemineastems, which catalyze the conversion
of benzaldehyde and pyruvate to (R)– and (S)– phenylacetylcarbi-
nol, (R)– and (S)– 2– hydroxypropiophenone, and dione4.[1] Hence,
[2,3,3,3– D4]– 8 could undergo transamination to [3,3,3 – D3]–
pyruvate [[3,3,3– D3]– 5], followed by conversion to [3,3,3– D3]– 4 cat-
alyzed by a ThDP-dependent carboligase. The dione4 could be
c o n v e r t e dv i aat r a n s a m i n a s et o(S)– [3,3,3– D3]– 1 (see Supporting
Information), which would be consistent with the biosynthetic
pathway postulated in the literature.
To investigate the mechanism of ( S)– 1 formation and to
confirm beyond doubt the conversion of 7 and 8 by an AOS,
15N-labeled 8 was used as a substrate for the AOS activity assay.
In the transaminase mechanism, the nitrogen is removed from8,
whereas in our experiments, labeled nitrogen remains in the mol-
ecule and is incorporated into the product (S)– 15N– 1 (Figure 1D,
Scheme 3C), which is in agreement with the postulated reaction
mechanism by an AOS.
In addition to the formation of (S)-1, the presence of (R)-1 was
detected in all activity assays as well as the analyses of all plant
lysates. Krizevski et al. describe the detection of (S)- and (R)-1 in
their analyses ofCatha edulis,which they explain by the possible
partial ketoamino tautomerization of (S)– 1 under their method
conditions (Scheme 4).[14] The putative involvement of ( R)-1
should be investigated in future studies.
Experiments were conducted to analyze the PLP dependency
of the putative AOS involved in the detected reaction. Activity
assays were performed with plant lysate from E. gerardiana
and E. americana. The results showed that no (S)– 1 formation
occurred when PLP was removed via size exclusion chromatog-
raphy. Conversely, (S)– 1 was formed when PLP was added back to
the reaction mixture, indicating a PLP-dependent reaction
mechanism.
The results of this study demonstrate the existence of a new
PLP-dependent enzymatic activity inEphedra species producing
ephedra alkaloids and inC. edulis. The incorporation of the deu-
terium label of [2,3,3,3-D4]– 8 and the nitrogen label of15N-8 into

(S)– 1 was demonstrated by labeling experiments (see Figure 1
and Scheme 3). In particular, the incorporation of the nitrogen
label and the PLP-dependency of (S)-1 formation supports the
hypothesis that an AOS catalyzes the formation of1 and bypasses
the need for dione4 as an intermediate.
The identification of the AOS enzyme responsible for the PLP-
dependent formation of (S)-1 in Ephedra species is ongoing and
crucial for further testing of our hypothesis; so far, it has been
hampered by the many PLP-dependent enzymes in the plants.
