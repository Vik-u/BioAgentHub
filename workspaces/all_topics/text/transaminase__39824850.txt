Present study was conducted to evaluate the detrimental impacts of exposure of Multi-walled Carbon 
Nanotubes (MWCNT-NP) on enzymatic activities and tissue structures in Swiss albino mice. The 
experimental groups of mice received MWCNT-NP for specific time period (seven or fourteen days). 
Two distinct doses of the MWCNT-NP solution were given orally: 0.45 µg and 0.90 µg, and the distilled 
water was given to the control group. Serum samples were extracted at 7 and 14 days after the 
experiment by centrifuging whole blood for 15 min at 3,000 rpm. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
test (ELISA) was used to measure many enzyme assays, such as Angiotensin Converting Enzymes 
(ACE), Alanine Aminotransferase (AL T), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), and Nicotinamide Adenine 
Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of tissue 
samples was done along with a histopathological examination. During a 14-day exposure, ACE, 
NADPH Oxidase, AL T, and AST enzyme levels were significantly higher in the exposed groups (0.45 µg 
and 0.90 µg) than in the control group (p < 0.05). Male mice exposed to MWCNT-NP showed substantial 
histological damage in the relevant organs as well as elevated enzyme activity levels. Present study 
showed a comprehensive and practical assessment of the toxicity associated with MWCNT-NP of 
different geometries and functionalization.

Nanoparticles are described as tiny particles that could dissolve and had one or more dimensions larger than 
their exterior ones. In addition, because of their unique attributes, nanoparticles have drawn a lot of interest 
and are being used in a variety of industries and medical domains. Additionally, a wide range of sectors have 
employed nanoparticles such as electronics industry, rubber sector, food additives, biosensors, paints, dyes, inks, 
as well as the cosmetics industry and sunscreens1. Although nanoparticles have various applications, it is essential 
to take into account their size, shape, and chemical composition. Nanoparticles have numerous advantages in 
the field of electronics. Additionally, cellular network connections, the endocytic route, and the absorption 
process have been cited as potential sources of cytotoxicity and disruptions to cellular homeostasis2. The danger 
posed by nanoparticles is strongly correlated with their size, which plays a crucial role in their interaction with 
biological systems. Smaller nanoparticles may be capable of absorbing a higher concentration of chemical 
compounds due to their larger surface area per mass unit. MWCNTs have diameters of 5 to 100 nm, whereas 
polyhedral diameters can exceed 100 nm, primarily due to the number of nanotube wall layers and functional 
groups attached to them. Due to increased cellular reactivity, there are consequently more toxicological effects3. 
Toxicity is also affected by the surface area of the nanoparticles because surface area and absorption efficiency 
are related4. Hence, the objective of nanotoxicity research is to decide how much these attributes could imperil 
the climate or the existence of living things. Nanomedicines are being developed to reduce the toxic effects

of medications while simultaneously increasing their bioavailability and biocompatibility. The production of 
MWCNT raises safety concerns because of the potential threats these industrial waste-derived nanoparticles 
may pose risk to the environment and workplace. While research on potential risks associated CNTs have been 
centered around skin contact and inhalation, it’s fundamental to remember that workers might swallow CNTs 
orally in situations where CNTs are utilized in various applications. The nature of the work environment can 
also lead to ingestion exposure. Industrial workers may unintentionally come into contact with CNT-containing 
products on their hands since they handle them frequently5. When eating or drinking, there is a real possibility 
that contaminated hands could transfer CNTs to the mouth if proper hygiene measures and personal protective 
equipment are not taken 6. Even though research on the health effects of carbon nanotube exposure is still 
ongoing, oral consumption is a possibility that should not be ignored. To protect workers’ health in this rapidly 
changing technological world, adequate training programs, stringent safety regulations, and industry-wide 
risk management strategies are required7. Numerous researches on nanotoxicity are being carried out in order 
to guarantee safe industrial production and lessen the influence of these nanomaterials on the environment. 
The purpose of these investigation is to address worries about the possible toxicity of multiwalled carbon 
nanotubes (MWCNT), which can provide serious exposure risks in environmental and occupational contexts. 
As highlighted in several publications, scientists have discovered that nanomaterials mostly enter the human 
body by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact8.
The toxicity of MWCNTs is determined by the degree of surface functionalization and the toxicity of the 
functional groups. MWCNTs’ toxicity is significantly influenced by their bioavailability. Studies and attention 
must be paid to metabolism, degradation, dissolution, clearance, and bioaccumulation in order to fully 
comprehend the limitations of nanoparticles as medicines. Utilizing carbon nanotubes has been found to be 
problematic in terms of biocompatibility. CNTs interact with organs and body fluids once they enter the body. 
Carbon nanotubes typically enter the human body through the mouth, nose, or skin, as stated by Staron 9. The 
respiratory and digestive systems are then attacked, and skin erosion is the result. The organ-specific toxicity 
of CNTs has been demonstrated by research. CNTs’ biodistribution within the body may result in a variety 
of toxicities based on their concentration, composition, size, shape, and functionalization 10. Importantly, 
the interference of CNTs with luminescence-based tests, which are frequently used to determine a variety of 
cytotoxic effects11. MWCNTs might get into the hands of workers during production, use, and disposal. Severe 
control conventions and individual personal protective equipment are required while taking care of nano objects 
and agglomerates greater than 100 nm (NOAA). There is still a lack of comprehensive research on the health 
effects of several nanomaterials. The majority of studies have focused on demonstrating pulmonary damage, 
such as inflammation and fibrosis, following oral, intratracheal, or inhalation exposures 12–14, genotoxicity15–18, 
cytotoxicity19–21, hepatotoxicity22–24.
Present research was conducted to comprehend the adverse impacts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNT-NP) exposure on visceral organs in Swiss albino mice. The study accomplishes a comprehensive 
analysis of the expected enzymatic interruptions inside the testicles, lungs, and liver by utilizing a scope of 
MWCNT-NP dosage, exposure durations, and particle sizes. To better comprehend the long-term effects of 
these nanomaterials on enzyme function and tissue structure, present study used use both low and high dosages. 
This dual approach will significantly contribute to the evaluation of MWCNT-NP safety and provide valuable 
insights into the potential effects of prolonged exposure.
Materials and methods
Characterization of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube nanoparticle (MWCNT-NP)
Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes purchased from Sigma Aldrich under the CAS number 308068-56-6, are as 
a dry powder, involving more than 98% carbon content. These Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Nanoparticles 
(MWCNT-NPs) have an average diameter of between 50 and 90 nanometers, as stated in the specifications 
provided by the manufacturer. Various methods, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive 
Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis with elemental mapping, X-ray Diffraction 
(XRD), and Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), were used to determine size and morphology 
of MWCNT-NPs.
Animal specifications
In the present study, a total of twenty adult male Swiss albino mice, aged 7–8 weeks, were employed. The mice 
were housed in cages, with four mice per cage and two mice per cage in a separate control cage, within a standard 
laboratory environment maintained at a temperature range of 20 to 24 degrees Celsius. The average body weight 
of the chosen mice was 33.7 ± 5 g. In keeping with the 3R principle (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) which 
aims to reduce the number of animals needed for research and protect animal welfare, only male mice were used 
in this experiment. The goal was to reduce the number of animals subjected to experimentation while ensuring 
the reliability of the results through the use of appropriate statistical methods with a minimal sample size. The 
experimental procedures and activities were designed to minimize any potential discomfort or distress to the 
animals. Additionally, selecting mice of a single-sex helped further reduce the number of animals used in the 
study. The chosen group size was carefully determined to strike a balance between obtaining scientifically robust 
data and adhering to ethical guidelines for the humane treatment of research animals. The mice were allowed a 
day to adjust to their new surroundings and were allowed unlimited access to food and water before the start of 
the experiment.

Experimental design
Sixteen mice were receiving treatment in the trial, divided into four different groups of four mice each. Two 
vehicle groups with two mice each were among these groups. In addition, the two exposure periods in the 
study design—7 and 14 days—were included. Furthermore, applying two distinct exposure doses (based on the 
calculated LD50 of 1.8 µg) before the final experimentation, the LD 50 equivalent to 25% of the lethal dose was 
assigned as MWCNT-NPs low dose (MWC-L). MWCNT-NPs high dose (MWC-H) was defined as the dose that 
corresponded to 50% of the LD50. MWCNT-NPs low dose (MWC-L) and MWCNT-NPs high dose (MWC-H) 
were the two different exposure dosages used. The first group: was treated with a low dose of MWCNT-NPs 
(0.45 µg) for 7 days; the second group: was treated with the same treatment for 14 days; the third group: served 
as vehicle control, receiving no treatment. For seven and fourteen days, respectively, the fourth and fifth groups 
were treated with a high dose of MWCNT-NPs (0.90 µg), whereas the sixth group received no treatment and 
served as the vehicle control. The oral gavage was used to administer each treatment. During the oral gavage 
procedure, the mice were gently secured with one hand, and a 3  ml suspension was carefully administered 
using a glass syringe fitted with a disposable polyurethane feeding needle. After the gavage process, the mice 
were then weighed and returned to their respective cages. The vehicle groups functioned as control, helping to 
contextualize the study’s conclusions. This thorough experimental design allowed for the evaluation of the effects 
of MWCNT-NPs at various dosages and exposure times through oral exposure.
Dose Preparation
An ultrasonic liquid processor operating at 4 °C and 30% amplitude was used to disperse MWCNT-NPs over 
30 min, with pulse measurements of one second on and one second off. Before being dispersed, MWCNT-NPs 
were suspended and sonicated in a sterile saline solution containing 1% tween 20. Before being given by oral 
gavage, the MWCNT-NP suspensions were subjected to a 15-minute sonication procedure to prevent them 
from aggregating. The treated mice were hence given these MWCNT-NP suspensions consistently by gavage for 
seven or fourteen days straight. Previous research guided the dosage and method of administration of MWCNT-
NP25,26.
Samples collection
Swiss albino mice were euthanized using halothane in a controlled environment. Halothane was inhaled in a 
closed container and ensuring the minimal animal stress. Exsanguination was performed after confirming the 
mice were fully unconscious and had ceased all signs of life. The mice were exsanguinated on days 7 and 14, and 
the blood was taken from the heart and placed in sterile, closed blood collection tubes (4.5 mL) that needed to 
be kept up-right for 30 min. The serum was then carefully transferred to a sterile, clean tube, securely capped, 
and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Before analysis, the serum was centrifuged for ten minutes at 3000 rpm to get 
rid of any clots. The lungs, liver, and testes were removed immediately following dissection, cleaned with PBS, 
and preserved in 10% formalin for histological analysis.
Enzymatic assays
The serum level of liver, lungs and testes enzymes; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) Oxidase enzyme and Angiotensin Converting 
Enzyme (ACE) were per-formed in the ELISA using commercially available kits (BT Lab, China).
Histopathology
Tissues were immersed in 10% buffered formalin for a duration of 24 h. Tissue samples were then positioned on 
histopathology cassettes and underwent processing using an automated tissue processor. The tissue underwent 
progressive dehydration with increasing concentration of ethyl alcohol solutions (ranging from 80 to 99.8%), 
followed by cleaning in xylene, and finally, embedding in paraffin. In order to identify histological alterations, 
the paraffin-embedded tissue was sliced into 5 μm sections using a rotary microtome (LEICA RM 2125). These 
sections were subsequently affixed to slides, subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining, and observed under a 
light micro-scope to identify and capture images of any histopathological changes.
Statistical analysis
The data from the enzymatic tests were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOV A), with a 
significance level of p < 0.05. The Least Significant Difference (LSD = 0.05) was utilized for post-hoc comparisons. 
The graphical representations’ bars were labeled with alphabetically (a, b, c, d) to indicate significant variations 
in doses and exposure durations.
Institutional review board statement
The study was carried out in compliance with guidelines of EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments 
and in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines or the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use 
of Laboratory Animals and received approval from the Ethical Committee of the Department of Environmental 
Sciences at Lahore College for Women University under the approval number ENV .SCI. /LCWU21.
Results
Characterization of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Nanoparticle
Advanced techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and 
particle size analyzer with the help of zeta potential were employed to characterize the MWCNT NPs, ensure 
the validation of the commercialized synthesis method and confirm the material’s authenticity. Figure  1 (a-c)

presents a de-tailed depiction of various physiochemical properties of the commercialized MWCNT-NP . The 
X-ray diffraction analysis showed specific peaks at 2θ values of 26°, 38°, 43°, 63°, and 78°. These correspond 
to the (111), (311), (400), (422), and (440) planes, respectively (Fig.  1a). This affirms the presence of a specific 
structure in the MWCNT-NP . The narrow peak width in the high-intensity diffraction pattern of MWCNT-NP 
confirms that it’s well-crystallized and has very few impurities. These results are consistent with earlier findings 
of MWCNT-NP27,28. The average size of the nanoparticles, measured using the particle size analyzer and zeta 
potential, ranged from 50 to 90 nm, with most of the MWCNT-NP being under 100 nm. A high zeta potential 
value is indicative of a stable dispersion, ensuring an even distribution of dispersed MWCNT-NP . Conversely, 
a low zeta potential results in an attractive force surpassing the repulsive force, leading to the flocculation of 
MWCNT-NP . Studies have shown that under conditions of low potential, the attractive force may dominate, 
causing coagulation and flocculation of the dispersion. In contrast, a high zeta potential, whether negative or 
positive, contributes to electrical stabilization29–31.
During the FTIR analysis, the structure and identified changes in functional groups within the MWCNT-NP 
were examined. This analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, alkynes, terpenoids, and flavonoids, 
indicating their involvement in the formation process of MWCNT-NP . Figure  1c shows the FTIR spectra of 
the commercialized MWCNT-NP . In the range of 2000 to 2500 cm−1, we observed two distinct peaks at (2357 
and 2127) cm −1. This indicates the presence of alcohol, phenolic, or water molecules with specific stretches 
and groups in the extract. Additionally, strong absorption peaks at 1647 cm −1 in the 1500 to 1700 cm −1 region 
suggest specific vibrations of surface groups. The signal at 1075 cm −1corresponds to the stretching vibration of 
nitrate ions (NO3 −1). The most pronounced stretching vibration of MWCNT-NP is observed at 715 cm −1. The 
coordination of MWCNT-NP with certain groups likely helps stabilize and cap the nanoparticles32–35.
Surface morphology and spot analysis using SEM-EDX analysis
An important analytical tool for examining the surface morphology, structure, and elemental makeup of 
industrial materials is the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) equipped with scanning electron 
microscope (SEM-EDS). This study employed Spot analysis, EDS elemental mapping, and SEM-EDS techniques 
to precisely determine the elemental composition and co-occurring elements of commercially available 
MWCNT-NP . As shown in Figure, 2, the SEM-EDS results showed that the MWCNT-NP tends to form larger 
clusters and has a spherical shape. In Fig. 2, the MWCNT-NP elemental mapping and EDS spot analysis provide 
Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction analyses (a), (b) FTIR analysis, and particle size (c) of commercialized MWCNTs NPs.

a comprehensive breakdown of the elemental composition at S1, S2, and S3. The peaks observed in the X-ray 
spectra correspond to the energy levels of each element, enabling the identification of the elemental composition 
of the commercialized NPs through the EDS spot analysis technique. In Fig. 2A ’s EDS spot analysis spectrum, it 
is evident that the MWCNT-NP exhibit a maximum of 100% carbon content at S1 and S3. However, at S2, there 
is approximately 98% carbon and 1.74% nickel present in atomic percentages. These findings suggest that the 
carbon element maintains a high level of purity throughout the material. The elemental composition and the 
proportions of co- occurring elements in the pure carbon MWCNT-NP were precisely characterized using spot 
analysis, EDS elemental mapping, and SEM-EDX methods.
Relative body weight
According to results, animals didn’t exhibit any significant clinical changes during the 7 and 14 days of repeated 
doses or the intervals before sample collection. No animal deaths during the period of the treatment were seen as 
a result of exposures, but mice at high doses had impaired mobility. For both doses of MWCNT-NP administered 
for 7 and 14 days, it was discovered that animals displayed a considerable reduction in body weight as shown in 
Fig. 3. Among all the groups, only the high-dose MWCNT-NP group (0.9 µg) exhibited a significant reduction 
in relative body weight gain within 7 days when compared to the baseline.

Assessment of enzymatic assays and its histopathological evaluation
Underlying mechanism of testicular toxicity
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes can travel through the bloodstream to the testes and taken up by Sertoli cells, 
Leydig cells, and germ cells after being exposed to them. Internalization causes the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), which in turn causes oxidative stress, cellular damage, and an inflammatory response marked by 
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significant histological changes, such as an expanded interstitial 
space, the loss of microorganism cells, disturbances in the seminiferous tubules, and degeneration of Sertoli 
and Leydig cells, can be triggered by oxidative pressure and persistent aggravation in the testicles36. Changes in 
enzymes action go with these shifts, for example, an expansion in the movement of apoptotic and steroidogenic 
catalysts and a lessening in the action of cell reinforcement proteins. Be-sides, changed angiotensin changing 
over protein activity can provoke reduced testosterone levels and appalling sperm creation, and cause infertility 
as displayed in Fig. 4.
Testicular enzyme (angiotensin converting enzymes: ACE)
Serum biochemical parameters were analyzed to determine the toxicity of MWCNT-NP . One of the enzymes 
examined in the testes was angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which has been linked to male fertility. 
According to the findings of the study, the mice that were given MWCNT-NP at a concentration of 0.90 g for 14 
days had higher levels of ACE than the mice that were given MWCNT-NP at a concentration of 0.45 g for 7 days. 
As can be seen in Fig. 5, the ACE levels of the MWCNT-exposed groups and the control group were significantly 
higher. These results show that exposure to MWCNT-NP , especially within the electronics industry, could raise 
concerns regarding occupational safety. The elevated ACE levels observed in the exposed groups raise concerns 
regarding the potential impact on male fertility.
Testicular histological analysis
Histopathological changes in the testes are shown in Fig.  6. Severe degeneration of seminiferous tubules and 
Leydig cell hyperplasia significantly increased in 14 days exposure of both dose groups MWCNT- NP treated 
mice as compared to vehicle control. There were mild epididymitis changes were observed in 7 days exposure 
of 0.90 µg dose group as compared to low dose 0.45 µg. Similar results were observed ACE enzyme (Fig. 4) that 
low dose of 7 days exposure has low values as compared to other dose and exposure time. So, the high dose with 
long term occupational exposure cause in-fertility in males’ workers of industries.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a pivotal role in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis and 
fertility. There are two isoforms of ACE1: somatic ACE1 (sACE1) and testicular ACE1 (tACE1), both transcribed 
from the same gene but regulated by different promoters. Research has highlighted that ACE1, as a seminal fluid 
protein, helps preserve sperm before and after translocation to females. In contrast, tACE1 plays a critical role

in sperm migration and adhesion to the zona pellucida (ZP), a crucial step in fertilization. Interestingly, studies 
show that male mice lacking sACE1 are fertile, while those without tACE1 are sterile, underscoring the distinct 
functions of these isoforms in reproduction. Recently cloned ACE2 is predominantly expressed in Leydig cells 
within the testes, as well as in the kidney and heart’s epithelial and endothelial cells 37. Its presence in the testes 
suggests that it regulates steroidogenesis, which impacts germ cells and overall reproductive health 38. ACE2 
deficiency has been shown to impair both basal and luteinizing hormone-stimulated testosterone production,

significantly affecting male fertility 39. Additionally, ACE2 has been implicated in maintaining testicular 
microvasculature and influencing fluid movement and permeability, although testosterone may mitigate some 
of these effects40. The correlation between elevated ACE levels and reduced reproductive function suggests that 
exposure to MWCNT-NP (Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes-Nanoparticles) could lead to infertility, particularly 
with prolonged exposure and higher doses. Previous studies have also documented significant histological 
and stereological changes in the testes following exposure to CNTs (Carbon Nanotubes). Oxidative stress and 
mitochondrial dysfunction, as reported by41, are believed to play a key role in the reproductive toxicity caused by 
CNTs, affecting both sperm quality and testicular health. Additionally42, explored the impact of functionalization 
and nanotube layers on the acute and chronic toxicological effects of CNTs on various organs, particularly the 
male reproductive system. Histopathological findings from these studies include vacuolization, degeneration, 
edema, and reduced germinal epithelium thickness in the seminiferous tubules. A reduction in spermatogenic 
cells was also observed, likely due to tubular degeneration. These effects were more pronounced in chronic 
exposure phases compared to acute phases, indicating that prolonged exposure to CNTs exacerbates testicular 
damage.
Underlying mechanism of pulmonary toxicity
Oral ingestion exposure to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which causes their deposition in lung 
tissue. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are produced when lung cells, such as alveolar 
macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, internalize the MWCNTs. This oxidative pressure brings about 
cell harm and an inflammatory reaction, described by the release of cytokines and enlistment of inflammatory 
cells. Fibrosis and tissue remodeling, characterized by excessive collagen deposition by activated fibroblasts, 
are the outcomes of chronic inflammation. Alveolar wall thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, granuloma 
formation, and fibrosis are histological changes in the lungs 43. These processes cause structural damage and

impaired lung function, both of which contribute to respiratory problems and reduce lung capacity as a whole 
as shown the mechanism in Fig. 7.
Pulmonary enzyme (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Oxidase: NADPH 
oxidase)
The findings demonstrated that in mice exposed to MWCNT-NP , notable effects were observed in the lungs. The 
group exposed to MWCNT-NP at a concentration of 0.90 µg for 14 days exhibited higher levels of the NADPH 
oxidase enzyme in comparison to the group exposed to MWCNT-NP at a concentration of 0.45 µg for 7 days. 
Additionally, both exposed groups showed significantly higher NADPH oxidase enzyme levels compared to the 
control group (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that MWCNT-NP exposure in the electronics industry requires 
occupational safety measures due to the potential for elevated NADPH oxidase levels, which may lead to 
increased ROS production can disrupt lung functioning by promoting inflammation, oxidative damage, fibrosis, 
and antioxidant depletion. These effects can impair respiratory function and increase the risk of developing lung 
disorders.
Pulmonary histological analysis
Figure 9 shows representative overviews of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, embedded in 
paraffin, from mice exposed to MWCNT-NP for both 7 and 14 days, across two dose groups (0.45 µg and 0.90 µg). 
In Fig. 9(f), MWCNT-NP were predominantly observed as black aggregates within macrophages or granulomas. 
Histopathological evaluation revealed significant changes induced by the two doses and exposure times of 
MWCNT-NP compared to the control group. These changes included varying degrees of histopathological 
alterations, such as pulmonary edema in alveoli and severe congestion, which can affect breathing and cause 
airway blockage. This condition is known as acute lung injury (ALI), a frequent acute respiratory disorder that 
is primarily characterized by increased permeability, pulmonary edema, and respiratory function impairment.
Elevated NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzyme levels in the lungs can impair lung function by promoting the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, signaling, and 
immune responses. Superoxide, a major source of cellular ROS, is primarily produced by NOX enzymes and 
the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation 44. The NADPH oxidase (NOX) family consists of seven 
distinct isoforms, which are responsible for the majority of ROS production. Under diseased conditions in the 
lungs, several NOX isoforms play crucial roles. For example, NOX-2 has been strongly linked to ovalbumin 
(Ova)-induced allergic asthma, while NOX-4 is elevated in patients with asthma. External factors, such as air 
pollution, ionizing radiation, certain medications (e.g., antibiotics and anticancer drugs), specific trace elements, 
and alcohol, can also increase ROS levels, leading to chronic oxidative stress. This oxidative stress, triggered by

environmental oxidants, can worsen allergic inflammation and disrupt normal cellular functions, contributing 
to lung damage, impaired lung function, and exacerbated asthmatic airway inflammation45.
Nanoparticles (NPs) are known to cause significant toxicities in the lungs, as evidenced by numerous studies. 
A study by46 revealed that C60 fullerene-treated lung tissue exhibited increased inflammatory cell counts, alveolar 
collapse, septal thickening, congestion, and pulmonary edema. Similarly47, investigated the pulmonary toxicity 
of graphene nanomaterials and observed significant pulmonary edema. The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles is 
influenced by various factors, including dose, size, shape, and chemical composition. Several studies have 
shown that nanoparticle toxicity can result from multiple mechanisms, such as ROS generation, DNA damage, 
inflammation, pulmonary edema, cell death, and extreme congestion48.
Underlying mechanism of hepatic toxicity
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are distributed into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, 
where they are absorbed by hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. This causes oxidative stress, 
which damages cells and triggers an inflammatory response marked by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activated Kupffer cells exacerbate inflammation and 
ROS production, further harming liver tissue. During chronic inflammation, activated hepatic stellate cells 
deposit too much collagen, causing fibrosis, which causes tissue remodeling and scarring. Histological changes 
in the liver include hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and lipid accumulation. As shown 
in Fig. 10, these processes result in the release of the liver enzymes ALT and AST, which serve as biomarkers for 
liver damage49,50.
Hepatic enzyme (AL T: Alanine aminotransferase and AST: aspartate aminotransferase)
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) are compounds dominantly present in 
hepatocytes, which are liver cells. These enzymes are released into the bloodstream when the liver is damaged or 
injured, causing their levels to rise. As a result, elevated ALT and AST levels are important signs of liver damage. 
Similarly, Fig. 11 (a -b) shows that ALT and AST levels of 0.45 µg/mouse group and 0.90 µg/mouse group are 
higher than those of the control group and it demonstrates that MWCNT-NP induced hepatic injury at 7- and 
14-days exposure. So, it indicates that liver cells have been damaged or are undergoing cell death. However, it’s 
important to note that the ratio of ALT to AST elevation can provide additional insights into the specific cause 
and severity of liver injury.
Hepatic histological analysis
As illustrated in Fig. 12, the liver showed several histological alterations. In com-parison to controls, histological 
alterations of the inflammatory, degenerative, and necrotic forms were seen in mice exposed to MWCNT-NP . 
For mice exposed to MWCNT-NP , there was a noticeable variation in the type of coagulative necrosis observed, 
and the occurrences were equivalent across dose groups. The mild cellular swelling, atrophy of hepatocytes 
changes and hydropic degeneration in the two dose groups of 7 days exposure were observed. The significant and 
severe cellular swelling and coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes were observed in 14 days exposure of two dose

groups. Nanoparticles deposited in liver tissue have the potential to impact liver cells and crucial physiological 
processes, as well as the biochemical functioning.
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 
γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) are liver enzymes commonly used as reliable indicators of liver health. Serum 
ALT and AST, predominantly found in the liver, are particularly considered specific markers of hepatic injury. 
Elevations in ALT and AST levels typically indicate liver damage or disease 51, as these enzymes are released 
when liver cells (hepatocytes) are injured. Hepatocytes play vital roles in detoxification, metabolism, and protein 
synthesis42, making their integrity crucial to liver function. A study on adult rats exposed to nanoparticles revealed 
dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, marked by significant increases in ALT and AST activity. Histopathological 
changes included congestion in the central vein and hepatic sinusoids, as well as hepatocyte degeneration, 
indicating damage to liver tissue 52. Such damage disrupts normal liver functions, including detoxification and 
protein synthesis. Liver inflammation, often associated with conditions like viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, 
B, or C), is another common cause of elevated ALT and AST levels 53. This inflammation compromises liver 
function and can lead to tissue damage, further impairing essential processes like protein synthesis, fluid balance 
(due to reduced albumin production), and enzyme activity 54. Prolonged liver damage can eventually result in 
cirrhosis, a condition characterized by scar tissue formation in the liver, which severely affects liver function55–57. 
Further studies on nanoparticle toxicity support these findings. In a study involving rats exposed to CuO/
ZnO nanoparticles, histopathological observations included slight cellular enlargement, granular cytoplasmic 
degradation of hepatocytes, and necrosis in the peripheral zones of hepatic lobules58. Interestingly, a lower dose 
administered over a longer period caused more severe liver abnormalities than a higher dose, suggesting that 
smaller, prolonged exposures may be more harmful. This highlights the potential risks for occupational workers 
exposed to nanoparticles. Overall, the evidence clearly demonstrates that MWCNT-NP exposure has adverse 
effects on vital organs, including the liver, lungs, and testes, primarily through disruption of enzymatic function

and tissue damage. These findings are particularly relevant for industrial workers frequently exposed to such 
nanoparticles.
Conclusions
Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT-NP) possess unique physicochemical properties, including electrical, 
mechanical, and thermal attributes, making them valuable for various industrial applications, particularly 
in electronics. This study investigated the toxicological effects of MWCNT-NP on enzymatic activity in key 
organs, with a focus on their potential impact on male reproductive health. The elevated levels of angiotensin-
converting enzyme, along with histopathological changes such as Leydig cell hyperplasia and seminiferous 
tubule degeneration, indicated that prolonged exposure could impair male fertility. Furthermore, increased 
NADPH oxidase levels in the lungs indicated oxidative stress, which could lead to lung damage, including 
pulmonary edema and congestion. In the liver, higher ALT and AST enzyme levels, coupled with histological 
signs of hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis, showed significant liver injury. These findings highlighted 
the significance to monitor MWCNT-NP exposure, especially among workers in industries that utilize such 
materials. Reducing exposure is essential to minimize health risks and promote safer working environments.
