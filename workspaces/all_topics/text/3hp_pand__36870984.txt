Abstract 
Background Owing to the Crabtree effect, Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a large amount of ethanol in the pres-
ence of oxygen and excess glucose, leading to a loss of carbon for the biosynthesis of non-ethanol chemicals. In the 
present study, the potential of a newly constructed Crabtree negative S. cerevisiae, as a chassis cell, was explored for 
the biosynthesis of various non-ethanol compounds.
Results To understand the metabolic characteristics of Crabtree negative S. cerevisiae sZJD-28, its transcriptional pro-
file was compared with that of Crabtree positive S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-11C. The reporter GO term analysis showed 
that, in sZJD-28, genes associated with translational processes were down-regulated, while those related to carbon 
metabolism were significantly up-regulated. To verify a potential increase in carbon metabolism for the Crabtree 
negative strain, the production of non-ethanol chemicals, derived from different metabolic nodes, was then under-
taken for both sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C. At the pyruvate node, production of 2,3-butanediol and lactate in sZJD-
28-based strains was remarkably higher than that of CEN.PK113-11C-based ones, representing 16.8- and 1.65-fold 
increase in titer, as well as 4.5-fold and 0.65-fold increase in specific titer (mg/L/OD), respectively. Similarly, for shiki-
mate derived p-coumaric acid, the titer of sZJD-28-based strain was 0.68-fold higher than for CEN.PK113-11C-based 
one, with a 0.98-fold increase in specific titer. While farnesene and lycopene, two acetoacetyl-CoA derivatives, showed 
0.21- and 1.88-fold increases in titer, respectively. From malonyl-CoA, the titer of 3-hydroxypropionate and fatty acids 
in sZJD-28-based strains were 0.19- and 0.76-fold higher than that of CEN.PK113-11C-based ones, respectively. In fact, 
yields of products also improved by the same fold due to the absence of residual glucose. Fed-batch fermentation 
further showed that the titer of free fatty acids in sZJD-28-based strain 28-FFA-E reached 6295.6 mg/L with a highest 
reported specific titer of 247.7 mg/L/OD in S. cerevisiae.
Conclusions Compared with CEN.PK113-11C, the Crabtree negative sZJD-28 strain displayed a significantly different 
transcriptional profile and obvious advantages in the biosynthesis of non-ethanol chemicals due to redirected carbon 
and energy sources towards metabolite biosynthesis. The findings, therefore, suggest that a Crabtree negative S. 
cerevisiae strain could be a promising chassis cell for the biosynthesis of various chemicals.

Background
With growing concern regarding environmental pro -
tection and energy security, microbial productions of 
biobased chemicals are getting increasing attention. 
Among them, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used 
model organism due to its advantages of well-understood 
genetic background, feasible molecular manipulation 
and high robustness to industrial conditions [1–4]. How -
ever, the ethanol overflow metabolism of S. cerevisiae, 
also referred to as the Crabtree effect, causes consider -
able loss of carbon flux in the production of non-ethanol 
chemicals [5].
Attempts to delete ethanol biosynthetic pathway have 
been, therefore, made to achieve Crabtree negative S. 
cerevisiae to eliminate the carbon loss, and in this con -
text, since alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts alde -
hyde into ethanol, deletion of all ADH isozymes has been 
envisaged as a potential solution [6]. However, ADH 
activity is required for the synthesis of many other spe -
cific metabolites, e.g., higher alcohols [7]. At the same 
time, pyruvate decarboxylase, encoded by PDC , con -
verts pyruvate to aldehyde in the cytoplasm, followed by 
conversion to acetate, i.e., the precursor of acetyl-CoA. 
Hence, even though inactivation of PDC s genes ena -
bles redirection of metabolic flux from ethanol towards 
the productions of target chemicals [8],  Pdc− strains are 
notoriously known for inability to grow in the presence 
of excess glucose medium due to inadequate supply of 
acetyl-CoA as well as  NAD+ regeneration. Furthermore, 
although adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) [9] and 
internal deletion in a transcriptional regulator MTH1  
[10] relieved the above growth defect of  Pdc− strains in 
glucose-containing medium, the lag phase was 3  days 
longer and the max specific growth rates were only 
0.1  h−1, thus impeding the strains’ industrial applications 
for biosynthesis.
To increase the availability of cytoplasmic acetyl-
CoA for  Pdc− strains, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 
(PDH), responsible for acetyl-CoA synthesis in mito -
chondria, was relocated to the cytoplasm [11]. However, 
the specific growth rate remained low due to PDH’s com-
plex need for cofactors, one of which (lipoic acid) was 
absent in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the  Pdc− strains 
require a more efficient pathway for supplying acetyl-
CoA. Recently, a heterogeneous pathway involving pyru -
vate oxidase (PO)/phosphotransacetylase (PTA) was used 
to replace the native PDCs, constructing a Crabtree-
negative S. cerevisiae with alternative acetyl-CoA sup -
plying pathway. In addition, double deletions of glycerol 
3-phosphate phosphatase (GPP1, GPP2) decreased the 
accumulation of acetate. Finally, using ALE and reverse 
engineering conferred the  Pdc− strain with two genetic 
mutations, namely, GPD1 W71* and MED2* 432Y, forming 
strain sZJD-28 (Table  1). This strain sZJD-28 produced 
no ethanol and most carbon source was distributed to 
biomass and  CO2 with growth rate reaching at 0.228   h−1 
in glucose medium [12]. To our knowledge, sZJD-28 is 
the fastest growing Crabtree negative S. cerevisiae, with 
great prospects in industrial biotechnology. However, the 
comparison of transcriptional patterns between Crab -
tree negative sZJD-28 and Crabtree positive yeast has 
not been demonstrated, with the former’s biosynthesis 
capacity also being unclear.
In the present study, analysis of Crabtree negative 
yeast sZJD-28 showed global transcriptional differences 
related to Crabtree positive strain CEN.PK113-11C, 
including enhanced carbon metabolism processes and 
down-regulated protein translation processes. To prove 
the increased metabolic fluxes towards biosynthesis, 
non-ethanol products derived from four representa -
tive metabolic nodes including pyruvate, malonyl-CoA, 
acetoacetyl-CoA and shikimate were also tested for both 
strains. The results highlighted obvious advantages of 
sZJD-28 in terms of the titer, yield and specific titer of 
the non-ethanol chemicals. Overall, the results suggested 
that, as a novel chassis cell, a Crabtree negative S. cerevi -
siae holds great potential for biomanufacturing of various 
chemicals.
Results and discussion
Transcriptional comparison between Crabtree negative 
and positive S. cerevisiae
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the physiologi -
cal differences between Crabtree positive and negative 
S. cerevisiae, the transcriptional profiles of sZJD-28 
were compared with that of CEN.PK113-11C using the 
reporter Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis [13]. Results 
showed that genes associated with GO terms related to 
protein translation processes, such as ribosome biogen -
esis and assembly, rRNA processing, cytoplasmic trans -
lation, translational initiation, transcription from RNA 
polymerase I and II promoter, chromatin organization 
and mitotic cell cycle, were down-regulated in sZJD-28 
(Fig.  1a). In addition, compared with the faster growing 
CEN.PK113-11C, the transcriptome changes related to 
the ribosome bioprocess of sZJD-28 further confirmed 
the growth law that ribosomal protein fraction are related 
to growth rate [14].
On the other hand, genes associated with GO terms 
related to cellular intermediates metabolism were up-
regulated in sZJD-28. In particular, the up-regulation 
of genes related to cellular respiration, lipid, cofactor 
and carbohydrate metabolic processes, metabolites and 
energy generation, as well as transmembrane transport-
related genes (Fig.  1a), hinted at an increase in the car -
bon metabolic capacity of Crabtree negative sZJD-28.

Meanwhile, strengthened carbon metabolism may 
also cause stress responses due to the accumulation of 
intermediates, and this was revealed by up-regulated 
stress-responsive genes (Fig.  1a). Agreement with this 
observation, results of reporter transcriptional fac -
tors (TFs) analysis highlighted the significantly altered 
expression of stress-responsive TFs, such as HSF1 , YAP1, 
MSN2, CST6, MSN4 in sZJD-28 compared with CEN.
PK113-11C (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
The central carbon and energy metabolism which 
were significantly changed at transcriptional levels are 
described in Fig.  1b, c. In an overall view, glycolysis in 
sZJD-28 was down-regulated, while PP pathway, TCA 
cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were up-
regulated, hence indicating that sZJD-28 might redirect 
more metabolic flux from fermentation to respiration 
compared with CEN.PK113-11C. These transcriptional 
changes also correlated well with the observed difference 
in growth rates between the two strains as the lower ATP 
generation rate through respiration instead of glycolysis 
resulted in a lower growth rate [15]. Besides, sZJD-28 
showed increased transcriptional levels of many other 
metabolic pathways, such as mevalonate pathway, shi -
kimate pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation 
pathway. Altogether, these results indicated that Crabtree 
negative sZJD-28 redistributes the carbon and electron 
fluxes to strengthen carbon metabolism. These transcrip -
tional changes in Crabtree negative sZJD-28 may further 
imply an elevated biosynthesis capacity compared with 
Crabtree positive CEN.PK113-11C when growing in the 
presence of excess glucose.

Evaluating the capacity of Crabtree negative S. cerevisiae 
to produce non‑ethanol chemicals
The transcriptional levels of genes related to OXPHOS 
were significantly improved in sZJD-28 compared with 
CEN.PK113-11C (Fig.  1b), indicating that the cytoplas -
mic  NAD+ regeneration in Crabtree negative S. cerevisiae 
may be restrained due to the abolished ethanol genera -
tion. Thus, an NADH-consuming pathway might relieve 
the pressure of redox imbalance in sZJD-28.
On the other hand, capacity of biosynthetic pathways 
with many genes up-regulated might be increased as 
well. For example, up-regulations of transcriptional lev -
els were generally occurred in PPP , shikimate pathway, 
MVA pathway and fatty acids pathways. Although some 
genes in PPP and shikimate pathway were down-regu -
lated, such as ZWF1 and ARO7, the numbers of up-reg -
ulated genes were clearly larger than the down-regulated 
ones. In addition, it is different to confirm the capacity 
of whole pathway by specific gene’ transcriptional level. 
This necessitates the demonstration of capacities for 
different pathways with many up-regulated genes. To 
confirm the possible enhanced biosynthetic capacity of 
sZJD-28, different pathways were constructed, based on 
the transcriptome analysis of both CEN.PK113-11C and 
sZJD-28, to detect generation of products from four rep -
resentative metabolic nodes.
Biosynthesis of 2,3‑butanediol and lactate from pyruvate
The production of pyruvate-derived, NADH-dependent 
2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) and lactate were first compared 
in sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C. S. cerevisiae possesses 
an inherent pathway for generating 2,3-BD from pyru -
vate (Fig.  2a). As previously reported, an overexpression 
of acetolactate synthase (ILV2) is sufficient for the pro -
duction of detectable level of 2,3-BD in S. cerevisiae [16]. 
Therefore, plasmid-based ILV2 expression was adapted to 
test the capacity of sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C to pro -
duce this compound. It was observed that strain 28-BD, 
harboring empty plasmid, already produced 208.4  mg/L 
of 2,3-BD, which was higher than the titer of strain 11C-
BD by more than 13 folds, while the specific titer (g/L/
OD) was improved by 16.8 folds (Fig.  2b). The yield of 
28-BD was also more than 13 folds higher than that of 
11C-BD as there was no residual glucose. In addition, 
the titer of 2,3-BD in ILV2 overexpression strain 28-BD-E 
was increased to 292.3  mg/L, higher than that of strain 
11C-BD-E by over threefolds (Fig.  2b), while the specific 
titer of 2,3-BD for 28-BD-E was 4.5 folds higher com -
pared with 11C-BD-E (Fig.  2c). These results indicated

biosynthetic pathways in S. cerevisiae. Both lactate dehydrogenase (LlLDH) from Lactococcus lactis and cytoplasm-relocated acetolactate synthase

that the imbalanced NADH level may drive the produc -
tion of NADH dependent chemicals, such as 2,3-BD, 
although the transcriptional level of ILV2 was similar 
between sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S2). Compared with Crabtree positive strain with dif-
ferent background, such as BY4742, 28-BD also shows 
fourfold higher yield of 2,3-BD (0.010 vs 0.002  g/g glu -
cose) [17].
Lactate is another NADH-dependent chemical derived 
from pyruvate (Fig.  2a). However, S. cerevisiae lacks a 
native lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for lactate produc -
tion, but it contains a mitochondrial LDHs (CYB2 and 
DLD1) that convert lactate to pyruvate. To test the poten-
tial advantage on cytosolic NADH provision of sZJD-28, 
an NADH-dependent LDH from Lactococcus lactis was 
introduced into CEN.PK113-11C and sZJD-28, result -
ing in strains 11C-LA and 28-LA, respectively. The 
results showed that 3.18 g/L of lactate was accumulated 
by 28-LA, while strain 11C-LA produced lactate with a 
peak value at 1.16 g/L. However, the latter consumed the 
lactate when glucose was exhausted (Fig.  2d, Additional 
file  1: Fig. S3). At the same time, the maximal specific 
titer of 28-LA was 64.9% higher than that of 11C-LA 
(Fig. 2e).
In S. cerevisiae, CYB2 and DLD1 are two genes involved 
in lactate utilization, whose expression are repressed by 
glucose and derepressed in ethanol or lactate [18, 19]. In 
sZJD-28, the transcriptional level of CYB2 was increased 
by 1.3-fold, while the transcriptional level of DLD1 was 
only decreased by 17% (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). With 
the significant decreased transcriptional levels of low-
affinity glucose transporters HXT1  and HXT3  compared 
with CEN.PK113-11C (Additional file  1: Fig. S2), glucose 
repression could have been partially relieved in sZJD-28, 
resulting in the improved transcriptional level of CYB2. 
Strain 28-LA accumulated lactate instead of consuming 
it as it was the case for 11C-LA, demonstrating the domi-
nant role of NADH consumption in Crabtree negative 
strain sZJD-28. Overall, the above results indicated that 
sZJD-28 possessed more efficient pyruvate and NADH 
supply compared with CEN.PK113-11C. In addition, 
lactate production of Crabtree positive strain CEN.PK2-
1C harboring different LDHs reached a maximal titer of 
2.50 g/L [20], lower than that of 28-LA (3.18 g/L).
p‑Coumaric acid biosynthesis from shikimate pathway
The shikimate pathway is usually applied in the synthe -
sis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) and their derivatives 
(AAADs) which serve as precursors for various indus -
trially relevant compounds [21]. For overproduction 
of shikimate derivatives in S. cerevisiae, enhancing the 
expression of native genes such as ARO1-4 and ARO7-9 
is the common metabolic engineering strategy [22–27]. 
As shown in Fig.  1c, increased transcriptional level of 
phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis such as the ARO 
genes and their precursor biosynthesis pathway PPP 
were observed for sZJD-28 compared with CEN.PK113-
11C. Furthermore, Pdc5p consume precursors of AAAs, 
para-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate into 
fusel alcohol/acid [28]. The deficiency of Pdc5p sZJD-28 
may be advantageous for the biosynthesis of AAAs and 
AAADs. These results indicated that sZJD-28 could be a 
superior strain for synthesizing aromatic chemicals com -
pared with CEN.PK113-11C.
To confirm the above hypothesis, p-coumaric acid 
was selected as a representative AAAD for subsequent 
experiments. The tyrosine ammonia lyase (FjTAL ) from 
Flavobacterium johnsoniae, which could covert tyros -
ine into p-coumaric acid, was expressed in sZJD-28 and 
CEN.PK113-11C resulting in 28-PCA and 11C-PCA, 
respectively (Fig.  3a). The production of p-coumaric 
acid by 28-PCA reached 270.7  mg/L, which was 67.8% 
higher than that of 11C-PCA (Fig.  3b), and the yield 
was also 67.8% higher than that of 11C-PCA due to no 
detected residual glucose. The specific titer in 28-PCA 
was increased by 97.5% than that of 11C-PCA (Fig.  3c). 
These results proved that the Crabtree negative S. cerevi -
siae sZJD-28 could display enhanced capacity for AAADs 
biosynthesis compared with the Crabtree positive S. cer -
evisiae CEN.PK113-11C. For other Crabtree positive S. 
cerevisiae, CEN.PK102.5B and BY4741-based p-coumaric 
acid producers reached titers of 0.202 and 0.081 g/L [29], 
which were lower than that of 28-PCA (Fig. 3b).
Farnesene and lycopene biosynthesis from acetoacetyl‑CoA
The MVA pathway is usually used by S. cerevisiae to syn -
thesize isoprenoids [30, 31]. In sZJD-28, the transcrip -
tional level of this pathway was clearly higher than that 
of CEN.PK113-11C (Fig.  1c). Acetyl-CoA C-acetyltrans -
ferase (Erg10p) serves as the first enzyme in the MVA 
pathway [ 32], whereas HMG-CoA reductase (Hmg2p) 
[33] and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase (Idi1p) 
[34] play rate-limiting roles in sterol biosynthesis. Meva -
lonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (Mvd1p) [35], 
farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (Erg20p) [36] and 
geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Bts1p) [37] serve 
as essential enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of iso -
prenoids (Fig.  4a). Increasing the transcription levels of 
these genes in S. cerevisiae have already been proven to 
improve the production of isoprenoids [38–42].
To demonstrate the potential strength of sZJD-28 on 
isoprenoids biosynthesis, two representative isoprenoids, 
namely, farnesene and lycopene, were selected. Overex -
pression of farnesene synthase rendered farnesene pro -
duction in both sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C, resulting 
Page 8 of 15Yao et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2023) 16:37 
in strains 28-Far and 11C-Far. The titer of farnesene in 
strain 28-Far was 20.5% higher than that of strain 11-Far 
(Fig. 4b). Crabtree positive strain YPH499 with farnesene 
synthase produced farnesene in titer of approximate 
12.5 mg/L [43], lower than that of 28-Far (Fig.  4b). Simi-
larly, after introducing CrtE, CrtB and CrtI, the three 
genes encoding key enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis, 
into the sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C, the lycopene pro-
duction of strain 28-Lyc reached 34.4  mg/L which was 
1.88 times greater than that of strain 11-Lyc (Fig. 4c). The 
improvements in the yields of farnesene and lycopene are 
the same as the final titers as there was not detected any 
residual glucose. Overall, the biosynthetic capacity of iso-
prenoids with acetoacetyl-CoA as precursor was stronger 
in Crabtree negative sZJD-28 compared with Crab -
tree negative CEN.PK113-11C. Specific titer of 28-Lyc 
reached 13.51 mg/g DCW, which was much higher than 
those of lycopene-producers derived from Crabtree posi -
tive strains, such as CEN.PK2-1D (approximate 5  mg/g 
DCW) [ 44] and BY4741 (approximate 4  mg/g DCW) 
[45].
3‑Hydroxypropionic acid and free fatty acids biosynthesis 
from malonyl‑CoA
In addition to the above metabolic nodes, malonyl-CoA 
is also an important precursor for chemical biosyn -
thesis (Fig.  5a). In this case, the transcriptional analysis 
indicated that malonyl-CoA derived fatty acid metabo -
lism in sZJD-28 was more active compared with CEN.
PK113-11C (Fig.  1c). In particular, the transcriptional 
level of ACC1, involved in the generation of malonyl-CoA 
in sZJD-28, was 74.8% higher than in CEN.PK113-11C 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S4).
To confirm these results, 3-hydroxypropionic acid 
and free fatty acids, the malonyl-CoA derivatives, were 
selected to determine the potential advantage of sZJD-28. 
The resulting strains 11C-HP and 28-HP were obtained 
after heterologous expression of malonyl-CoA reductase 
(MCR1) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus in CEN.PK113-
11C and sZJD-28. As expected, 3-HP production in 
28-HP was 19.2% higher than in 11C-HP (Fig.  5b), and 
the specific titer was 20.8% higher (Fig.  5c). In addition,

compared with a reported study about the produc -
tion the 3-HP by Crabtree positive strains, sZJD-28 also 
showed a 4.57-fold higher titer [46], also indicating the 
higher biosynthetic capacity of Crabtree negative strains. 
As previously reported, simultaneously deleting FAA1 , 
FAA4 and POX1 enabled S. cerevisiae to accumulate free 
fatty acids (FFA) [47]. Therefore, these three genes were 
deleted in sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C, resulting in 
strains 28-FFA and 11C-FFA. Compared with 11C-FFA, 
28-FFA showed higher production of free fatty acids by 
76.3%, reaching 780.4 mg/L (Fig.  5c) and higher specific 
titer by 71.5% (Fig.  5d). The improvements in yields of 
3-HP and FAA also reached 19.2% and 76.3% as no resid -
ual glucose. Besides the key gene ACC1 , the up-regulated 
FAS1 and FAS2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2) could also have 
contributed to the improved capacity for fatty acids bio -
synthesis of sZJD-28.
Compared with Crabtree positive strains, Crabtree 
negative ones showed superior biosynthetic capabilities 
for chemicals derived from multiple metabolic nodes. 
Of these, lactate and 2,3-BD derived from pyruvate were 
significantly improved, while p-coumaric acid derived 
from shikimate, 3-HP derived from malonyl-CoA, and 
farnesene derived from acetoacetyl-CoA showed mod -
est improvements in the Crabtree negative strain. This 
was probably due to needs for different cofactors for 
different pathways. Ethanol production consumes the 
surplus NADH generated by glycolysis, such that delet -
ing ethanol synthesis leads to accumulation of NADH in 
the Crabtree negative strain. The biosynthesis of 2,3-BD

and lactate requires the use of the cofactor NADH and 
this ensures a balance of NADH production in the cyto -
sol during the conversion of glucose to pyruvate [48, 
49]. In the shikimate pathway,  NAD+ instead of NADH 
is needed for Pha2p and Try1p, and hence, a similar bal -
ance in NADH is not achieved when using this pathway. 
MCR1 from Chloroflexus aurantiacus [50] used for the 
production of 3-HP and over-expression of HMGR  [51] 
in the MVA pathway are both NADPH-dependent. Con -
sequently, for these products there was no balancing of 
NADH. The different cofactors needed for producing the 
different products may, therefore, result in varying per -
formance during improving biosynthesis by the Crabtree 
negative chassis strain.
Fed‑batch fermentation of Crabtree negative FFA 
hyperproducing S. cerevisiae
As reported, deleting PAH1  could stimulate FFA pro -
duction in the Crabtree positive S. cerevisiae due to the 
up-regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis indirectly by 
phosphatidic acid [47]. To construct a Crabtree nega -
tive FFA hyperproducer, PAH1  was, therefore, deleted 
based on strain 28-FFA. The resulting strain 28-FFA-E 
showed 75.3% and 86.7% higher FFA titer and specific 
titer, respectively, compared with 28-FFA. reaching 
1333.2 mg/L and 217.7 mg/L/OD (Fig.  5e). To investigate 
the biosynthetic capacity of this FFA producer, fed-batch 
fermentation of 28-FFA-E was conducted in a 5  L bio -
reactor. During the fermentation process, glucose con -
sumption, cell growth as well as production of FFA and 
intermediates were monitored. Glucose feeding was ini -
tiated at 40 h and glucose concentration was kept below 
1  g/L. KOH was used to adjust pH to 5.0 and the dis -
solved oxygen was maintained above 20% by automatic 
adjustment of stirring rate. After 180 h, the titer of FFA 
reached 6295.6 mg/L (Fig. 6a).
Although fed-batch production of FFA was lower than 
the highest titer reported for a Crabtree positive S. cer -
evisiae strain, i.e., Y&Z036 (33.4  g/L) [52], the specific 
titer of 28-FFA-E reached 247.7 mg/L/OD which is over 
2 folds higher than that of Y&Z036. In addition, the FFA 
content of 28-FFA-E reached 897.3 mg/g DCW (accord -
ing to 3.55 OD = 1  g DCW/L [53]), and as such it was 
comparable with the content of oleaginous yeast Yar -
rowia lipolytica (1200 mg/g DCW) [54] and higher than 
the specific titer of E. coli (about 470  mg/g DCW) [55] 
according to 1 OD = 0.379 g DCW/L [56]. It is worth not-
ing that specific titers reached close to and higher than 
the 1000  mg/g DCW due to the secretion of fatty acids 
into the culture broth. Despite of the lower FFA titer of 
28-FFA-E than the Crabtree positive S. cerevisiae strain 
Y&Z036 [52], 28-FFA-E still showed great potential in 
FFA biosynthesis, because there was much less genetic 
optimization performed in 28-FFA-E. Furthermore, as 
shown in Fig.  6b, the high accumulation of pyruvate and 
citrate in the fed-batch fermentation process, reached 
27.8  g/L and 5.2  g/L, respectively, thereby causing car -
bon loss and low biomass. To overcome these problems, 
increasing the copy of PO-PTA and heterogenous expres-
sion of ATP-citrate lyase, converting pyruvate and citrate 
to acetyl-CoA, respectively, could relieve intermediates 
accumulations, thus resulting in more carbon towards 
the biosynthesis of targeted chemicals.

Conclusions
In this study, comparative transcriptome analysis 
between Crabtree positive and the fast-growing Crabtree 
negative S. cerevisiae was demonstrated for the first time. 
It turned out that transcriptional levels of genes related to 
OXPHOS and central metabolic pathways were changed 
significantly. This analysis provided key information 
about the potential pathways for non-ethanol chemicals 
production, which is helpful to choose chemicals syn -
thesized in this superior chassis cell. The following dem -
onstration of productions from various metabolic nodes 
confirmed the advantages of Crabtree negative strains in 
yield, titer and specific titer. In addition, this study col -
lectively showed the preferable feature of Crabtree nega -
tive strains in NADH-consuming chemicals biosynthesis 
by balancing redox homeostasis. Among these chemi -
cals, compared with Crabtree positive strain, produc -
tions of NADH dependent chemicals 2,3-BD and lactate 
in Crabtree negative strains were significantly improved 
by 16.8 and 1.65 folds in titers, respectively; Productions 
of p-coumaric acid, farnesene, lycopene, 3-HP and FFA 
from corresponding pathways with up-regulated genes in 
Crabtree negative strains were improved by 0.19–1.88-
folds in titer; In fed-batch, Crabtree negative 28-FFA-E 
reached a highest reported specific titer of FFA in S. 
cerevisiae. This research not only deepened the current 
understanding of the carbon metabolism of Crabtree 
negative S. cerevisiae, but also proved that such a strain 
possesses inherent superiority for chemicals biosynthe -
sis, thereby providing an alternative chassis cell for syn -
thetic biology.
Methods
Culture conditions and media
Escherichia coli DH5a was routinely used for plasmid 
propagation in LB medium, consisting of 10 g/L tryptone, 
5 g/L yeast extract and 10 g/L NaCl.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring different biosyn -
thetic pathways was transferred from glycerol stock 
to 5  mL minimal medium, consisting of the following 
components: 20  g/L glucose, 14.4  g/L  KH2PO4, 7.5  g/L 
 (NH4)2SO4, 0.5  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, trace metal, vita -
min solution, 40  mg/L histidine and/or 40  mg/L ura -
cil according to auxotroph [57]. Transfer the culture to 
20 mL same medium with initial OD of 0.05 when strains 
were grown to log-phase, and fermentation broth were 
sampled for analysis at 120  h. For CEN.PK113-11C and 
sZJD-28 derived strains, samples were taken between 0 
and 120  h, which is longer enough to consume carbon 
source and suitable for evaluate the biosynthetic capacity 
of chemicals.
Transcriptome analysis
Glycerol stocks of sZJD-28 and CEN.PK113-11C were 
transferred into 5 mL YPD (20 g/L glucose, 20 g/L pep -
tone and 10 g/L yeast extract) medium, and incubated at 
30 °C, 250 rpm for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centri -
fuging at 12,000  rpm for 1  min. Supernatants were dis -
carded and cells were washed by sterile water for twice. 
Cells were resuspended in 20 mL minimal medium with 
initial OD of 0.05, pH 6.0, consisting of the following 
components: 20  g/L glucose, 14.4  g/L  KH2PO4, 7.5  g/L 
 (NH4)2SO4, 0.5  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, trace metal, vitamin 
solution, 40 mg/L histidine and 40 mg/L uracil [57], and 
incubated at 30 °C, 250 rpm. Cells were sampled for tran-
scriptome analysis when OD600 reached 1.
After sampling, total RNA was extracted using the 
Yeast RNA Kit (Omega). The RNA sequencing was car -
ried out in Novogene Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Illumina 
RNA-Seq data were aligned on the yeast genome using 
Bowtie2 [58]. Transcript abundance was estimated by 
method RSEM [59]. Differential expression analysis was 
processed by edgeR package in the R programming lan -
guage [60]. Reporter analysis on GO terms and tran -
scription factors was carried out via the Platform for 
Integrative Analysis of Omics (PIANO) R package [13]. 
GO slim mapping file was downloaded from SGD (http:// 
sgd- archi ve. yeast genome. org/) and gene-TF interaction 
pairs were obtained from YeasTMine (http:// yeast mine. 
yeast genome. org).
Construction of biosynthesis pathways
L-lactate dehydrogenase (LlLDH) was from Lactococ-
cus lactis NZ9000. Acetolactate synthase (cytoILV2) was 
native S. cerevisiae gene but was truncated (2–90 aa) [8] 
to relocate it to the cytoplasm. Both LlLDH and cytoILV2 
were inserted into plasmid pSP-GM2 between the restric-
tion sites BamHI and NheI to construct plasmids used for 
production of lactate and 2,3-BD, respectively. Malonyl-
CoA reductase (CaMCR ), α-farnesene synthase (MdFS ) 
and tyrosine ammonia lyase (FjTAL ), from Chloroflexus 
aurantiacus [46], Malus domestica [61] and Flavobac -
terium johnsoniae [62], respectively, were codon opti -
mized and placed under the control of TEF1 promoter, 
with their expression cassettes subsequently integrated 
into chromosomal site XII-2 to construct strains produc -
ing 3-HP , farnesene and p-coumaric acid. Similarly, gera-
nylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (PaCrtE), phytoene 
synthase (PaCrtB) and phytoene desaturase (PaCrtI), all 
from Pantoea ananatis, were codon optimized, with their 
expression placed under the control of the promoters 
CDC19, CCW12 and TDH3, respectively. As before, the 
expression cassettes were then integrated into chromo -
somal site XII-2 to construct lycopene-producing strains.

FFAs-producing strains were constructed by deleting 
FAA1, FAA4, POX1 and PAH1.
Expression formats were chosen according to previ -
ous study. As reported, 2,3-BD [16, 63–65] and lactate 
[20, 66–68] were widely produced by expressing genes 
in plasmids; meanwhile, p-coumaric acid [21, 29, 69–71], 
lycopene [44, 45, 72, 73], farnesene [3, 43, 74] and 3-HP 
[75] were widely produced by integrating genes into 
genome. Using the same expression format as reported 
will be of referential significance for demonstrating the 
biosynthetic capacity of chassis cell.
All the plasmids and expression cassettes were trans -
formed into yeast by LiAC/ssDNA method [76]. Expres -
sion cassettes were integrated by CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
All strains used in this study are listed in Table  1. All 
primers, gRNA and deleting donors used in this study 
were summarized in Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2.
Metabolite extraction and analysis
3-HP and lactate were measured at 65 °C by an HPLC 
system equipped with a refractive-index detector and 
a Bio-Rad HPX-87H column using 0.5  mM  H2SO4 as 
mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6  mL   min−1. Esterifi -
cation and analysis of FFAs were performed as previ -
ously described [78]. 2,3-BD was detected by the same 
methods as 3-HP , except for the use of 5  mM  H2SO4 
as the mobile phase and column temperature of 28 °C. 
Lycopene and farnesene were detected by HPLC 
equipped with an Innoval C18 column. The extracted 
and analyzed method was described previously [45]. 
p-Coumaric acid was detected by HPLC equipped 
with Discovery HS F5 150  mm × 2.1  mm column, as 
described in a previous study [62].
All data were presented as the mean of three biologi -
cal replicates with error bars representing the standard 
deviations. P values were generated by performing t 
tests for determining statistical significance.
Fed‑batch fermentation of free fatty acids in 5 L bioreactor
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transferred from glyc -
erol stock to 5  mL SD-URA medium and incubated 
at 30 °C and 250 rpm. Transfer the culture to 200 mL 
minimal medium with initial OD of 0.05. Once the 
strains reached the log-phase, they were transferred to 
a 5 L bioreactor containing 1.5 L batch medium, pH 6.0, 
consisting of 20  g/L glucose, 5  g/L  (NH4)2SO4, 3  g/L 
 KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 40 mg/L URA, 40 mg/L 
histidine, trace metal and vitamin solutions. Fed 
batch medium contained 600  g/L glucose, and 7  g/L 
 (NH4)2SO4, 15  g/L  KH2PO4, 2.5  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 
200  mg/L URA, 200  mg/L histidine, fivefolds of trace 
metal and vitamin solutions.
