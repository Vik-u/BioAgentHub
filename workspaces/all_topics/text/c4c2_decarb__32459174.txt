Abstract The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is a unique primary-active
transporter that utilizes the free energy derived from oxaloacetate decarboxylation for sodium
transport across the cell membrane. It is composed of 3 subunits: thea subunit catalyzes carboxyl-
transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin, the membrane integratedb subunit catalyzes the subsequent
carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport, theg subunit interacts with the
a and b subunits and stabilizes the OAD complex. We present here structure of theSalmonella
typhimurium OAD bg sub-complex. The structure revealed that theb and g subunits form a
b
3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer with extensive interactions between the subunits and shed light on the
OAD holo-enzyme assembly. Structure-guided functional studies provided insights into the sodium
binding sites in theb subunit and the coupling between carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and
sodium transport by the OADb subunit.
Introduction
The sodium gradient across the cell membrane is utilized in many microorganisms as an energy
source to drive ATP synthesis, nutrient intake, cell motility and other processes (
Mulkidjanian et al.,
2008). The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is the first identified sodium pump
responsible for maintaining the sodium gradient in microorganisms (Dimroth, 1980). It is found in
many bacteria and archaea including the human pathogensKlebsiella aerogenes (Dimroth, 1980),
Klebsiella pneumonia (Schwarz et al., 1988), Salmonella typhimurium (Wifling and Dimroth, 1989)
and Legionella pneumophila(Jain et al., 1996). It plays a critical role in the anaerobic citrate fermen-
tation pathway (Dimroth et al., 2001), and has been shown to be important for the pathogenicity of
certain pathogens (Hwang et al., 1992; Jain et al., 1996). OAD utilizes the free energy derived
from oxaloacetate decarboxylation to drive sodium transport across the cell membrane. It is com-
posed ofa, b and g subunits. Biotin serves as the carrier for the carboxyl group in its reaction and is
covalently linked to the biotin-carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain in thea subunit C terminus.
The carboxyltransferase (CT) domain in thea subunit catalyzes the carboxyl-transfer from oxaloace-
tate to biotin; theb subunit catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the cou-
pled sodium transport; theg subunit stabilizes the OAD complex by interacting with thea and b
subunits (
Buckel, 2001; Dimroth et al., 2001).

RESEARCH ARTICLE
OAD belongs to the decarboxylase sodium pump family (Buckel, 2001; Dimroth et al., 2001).
Members in this family also include methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylases (MCD), glutaconyl-CoA
decarboxylase (GCD) and malonate decarboxylase (MAD). They utilize the free energy derived from
decarboxylating the relevant substrates to drive sodium transport across the cell membrane, and
constitute a unique family of primary-active transporters (
Saier et al., 2016). MCD and GCD catalyze
a two-step decarboxylation/sodium transport reaction similar to the OAD reaction (Buckel, 2001).
Their CT and BCCP domains are encoded by separateda and g subunits, respectively. Theirb subu-
nits are highly homologous to the OADb subunit (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). They also form
stable complexes and contain a scaffoldingd subunit homologous to the OADg subunit (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1b; Buckel, 2001). MAD catalyzes a more complex reaction. TheMalonomonas
rubra MAD transfers the carboxyl group in malonate to a specific acyl carrier protein before to bio-
tin. Its MadB component catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and sodium
transport (
Dimroth and Hilbi, 1997). MadB is homologous to the OADb subunit (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1a).
Structural studies of the CT domains in OAD (Studer et al., 2007) and GCD (Wendt et al., 2003)
have provided insights into their substrate decarboxylation. Homologues of the CT and BCCP
domains in decarboxylase sodium pumps are found in many biotin-dependent enzymes. Structural
studies on these enzymes have also shed light on their function (
Jitrapakdee and Wallace, 2003;
Tong, 2013; Waldrop et al., 2012). In contrast, little is known about the structure of other compo-
nents in decarboxylase sodium pumps, and the mechanism of their sodium transport is poorly under-
stood. We present here structure of theSalmonella typhimuriumOAD (StOAD) bg sub-complex. The
structure revealed that theb and g subunits form ab
3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer with extensive interac-
tions between subunits and provides insights into the OAD holo-enzyme assembly. The structure
and structure-guided functional studies provided insights into the sodium binding sites in theb sub-
unit and identified a number of residues critical for its function. Our data suggest an ‘elevator mech-
anism’ for the sodium transport by the OADb subunit and provide insights into its coupling with
carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation.
Results
Overall structure of theStOAD bg sub-complex
We initially attempted to study the structure of theStOAD holoenzyme and expressed it inEscheri-
chia coli(E. coli)and purified it through a 6x Histidine tag engineered to the N-terminus of theg sub-
unit and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA). The purified complex was crystallized with vapor
diffusion, and the crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 4.4 A˚ at the Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis
revealed that they do not contain thea subunit, suggesting that it dissociated during crystallization
and the bg sub-complex is more stable. We further purified thebg sub-complex, which appears to
be well-folded judged by our gel filtration experiments (
Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Although
it crystallized, the crystals did not diffract better. Dynamic light scattering experiments indicated
that it has a molecular weight of 250 kDa, suggesting that it is suitable for cryo-electron microscopy
(EM) studies. We carried out cryo-EM experiments and determined its structure (
Figure 1—figure
supplement 3a–d) to an overall resolution of 3.88 A˚ (Figure 1—figure supplement 3e). Resolution
of the core regions reaches 3.6 A˚ (Figure 1—figure supplement 3f). The excellent density (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 4a–e) allowed us to place all the non-hydrogen atoms for residues 13–
432 in theb subunit. Additional poorer densities were found for ana helix about 40 amino acids in
length (Figure 1—figure supplement 4f). Since most residues in theb subunit were accounted for,
residues 2–43 in theg subunit were assigned to this helix based on secondary structure prediction
and density features. The structure agrees well with the experimental data and expected geometric
values (
Table 1). Although 100 mM of sodium chloride was included in the protein buffer, no obvi-
ous densities for sodium ions were observed, probably due to the moderate resolution. Using the
cryo-EM structure as the search model, we determined the crystal structure of thebg sub-complex
by molecular replacement (
Supplementary file 1A). No major conformational differences were
found between the cryo-EM and the crystal structures. In the remainder of the manuscript we will
mainly discuss the cryo-EM structure, since its resolution is higher.

The structure revealed that theb and g subunits form ab3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer (Figure 1a–b).
The expected molecular weight estimated by dynamic light scattering is larger than that of the hex-
amer (168 kDa), likely due to detergent molecules bound to the hexamer. Theb subunits form a tri-
mer at the center of the hexamer, theg subunits are located in the periphery. One side of theb
subunit trimer is predominantly positively charged, the opposite side is negatively charged
(
Figure 1c–d). The ‘positive inside rule’ (von Heijne, 1992) indicates that the positively charged side
is located in the cytoplasm. This side is also concentrated with conserved residues (Figure 1—figure
supplement 5a–d). The structure revealed no solvent accessible channels connecting the cytoplasm
and the periplasm.

The structure indicates that theg subunit C-terminal tail is located in the cytoplasm and could
mediate interactions with thea subunit (Figure 1a–b). This is in line with previous reports that the
isolated g subunit C-terminal tail interacts with thea subunit (Balsera et al., 2011; Dahinden et al.,
2005), and thea subunit fails to interact withg subunit variants with mutations or deletions in this
region (Schmid et al., 2002). To directly test if theg subunit C-terminal tail mediates interactions

between thea subunit and thebg sub-complex, we generated aDgCT variant of theStOAD expres-
sion construct lacking residues 61–84 in theg subunit. The removed residues span the predicted
amphipathic helix ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ) in the Vibrio cholerae OAD isoform 2
(VcOAD2) that has been proposed to bind thea subunit association domain (AD) to form a structure
similar to the pyruvate carboxylase (PC) tetramerization (PT) domain (Balsera et al., 2011). We
found that theDgCT truncation did not affect the protein level of thea subunit in the soluble fraction
(Figure 1—figure supplement 6a) or the interaction between theb and g subunits (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 6b). However, it severely reduced the amount of thea subunit co-purified with the
bg sub-complex (Figure 1—figure supplement 6b). These data indicate that theg subunit C-termi-
nal tail is not involved in the interaction between theb and g subunits but plays a critical role in the
interaction between thea subunit and thebg sub-complex.
Structure of theStOAD b subunit
The b subunit is composed of 10 transmembrane helices (T1-10), two helical hairpins (H1a/b and
H2a/b) and a number of additional helices (Figure 1aand Figure 2a–c). Its N- and C-terminal halves
form two repeats of inverted topology (Figure 2c). The region between T2 and T3’ contains four
helices (aE1-4), which form a solvent exposed domain E. This domain is poorly conserved and does
not exist in OAD in some organisms (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). H1 and H2 point into the
interior of theb subunit from opposite sides. They and surrounding helices T4-5 and T9-10 form a

bundle-like core domain. The tips of H1 and H2 meet at the middle of the core domain. The rest of
the b subunit forms a scaffold domain, surrounding the core domain at one side (
Figure 2a–b).
A search through published structures (Holm and Rosenstro¨ m, 2010) indicated that the closest
structural homologue of the b subunit is the sodium/citrate symporter CitS (Kim et al., 2017;
Wo¨ hlert et al., 2015). The structures of theSalmonella entericaCitS (SeCitS) and theb subunit can
be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 4.1 A˚ for equivalent Ca atoms (Figure 2—
figure supplement 1a–b), despite their limited sequence identity (8%,Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1c). All major secondary structure elements in theb subunit core and scaffold domains have
equivalents in CitS, which contains an extra helix at its N-terminus. Theb subunit belongs to the cat-
ion:proton antiporter (CPA) superfamily and has been suggested to have homology to proteins in
the CPA2 family (
http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc = 3.B.1). Consistently, we found that the
StOAD b subunit structure is homologous to the structure of the sodium/proton antiporter NapA
(Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–b; Coincon et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013), a member of the
CPA2 family. It also has homology to sodium/proton antiporters NhaP ( Paulino et al., 2014;
Wo¨ hlert et al., 2014) and NhaA (Hunte et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2014), the sodium/bile acid sym-
porter ASBT (Hu et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2014) and others. The homology is pronounced for the
core domain. The equivalent regions in theseb subunit homologues contain two discontinuous trans-
membrane helices in the place of H1 and H2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a ). The scaffold
domain also shows significant homology to equivalent regions in NapA and NhaP, which contain an
extra helix (
Figure 2—figure supplement 2b).
Interactions between subunits
Extensive interactions between theb subunits are observed in our structure. The interactions are pri-
marily mediated by the scaffold domain (
Figure 3a–b). At the outer part of the trimer interface, T1
and T2 interact with T6 and T7 in the neighboring monomer. Towards the center, interactions are
mediated by T3’, T3 and T8. These interactions are primarily mediated by hydrophobic residue side
chains. 2700 A˚
2 of surface area is buried at each interface between the scaffold domain in different
monomers. HelixaE4 in domain E also makes a minor contribution to the trimer interface. 250 A˚2 of
surface area is buried at each interface betweenaE4 in different monomers.
Unlike the b subunit, the homologous CitS forms a dimer (Kim et al., 2017; Wo¨ hlert et al.,
2015). Structural analysis indicated that the large conformational differences between T1 and T6
and their equivalents in CitS (Figure 2—figure supplement 1b) plays a key role in determining the
oligomerization states. In theb subunit, T1 and T6 are located close to core domain. In CitS, the
equivalent H2 and H8 are located away from the core domain (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a).
H2 and H1 N-terminal to it interact with H8 in the other monomer in the CitS dimer (Figure 3cand
Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). Compared to equivalent regions in theStOAD b subunit, these
helices create a ‘wedge’ at the interface between monomers, which promotes dimer formation
(
Figure 3c–d). Additional homologues of the b subunit including NapA (Coincon et al., 2016;
Lee et al., 2013) and NhaP (Paulino et al., 2014; Wo¨ hlert et al., 2014) also form dimers, similar
structures are observed at their dimer interfaces (Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–c). The confor-
mations of T1 and T6 are stabilized by extensive and mostly hydrophobic interactions with the neigh-
boring T2 and T7, respectively (
Figure 2b). In CitS, NapA and NhaP, a number of neighboring
structural elements contribute to the stabilization of the drastically different conformations of the
T1/T6 equivalents (
Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–e).
Our structure also revealed extensive interactions between theb and g subunits. Each g subunit
interacts with oneb subunit (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f). The interface buries 3100 A˚2 of sur-
face area and is primarily composed of residues with hydrophobic side chains. T6 in theb subunit
makes a significant contribution to the interface. However, if it is located away from the core domain
like its equivalent in CitS, it is not expected to interact with theg subunit. Additional interactions are
mediated by T4 and T10.
The structural analysis suggested that positions of T1 and T6 are critical for theb subunit trimeri-
zation and binding theg subunit. To probe the functional roles of the positions of T1 and T6, we
introduced substitutions in theb subunit to promote them adopting conformations similar to their
equivalents in CitS. T1, T6 and neighboring regions were substituted with equivalent regions in
SeCitS. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the substituted b/CitS protein no longer

interacts with theg subunit (Figure 3—figure supplement 1g), and is likely dimeric (Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1h).
Sodium binding sites in theb subunit
Several cavities are found on in theStOAD bg sub-complex. A large cavity opening to the periplasm
is found at the center of theb subunit trimer. The densities in it were modeled as three n-dodecyl-D-
maltoside (DDM) molecules used in the complex purification (Figure 4a). This cavity is primarily
formed by residues with hydrophobic side chains in T3’, T3 and T8, suggesting that it may not con-
tribute to sodium binding. In addition, eachb subunit contains two negatively charged cavities in the
cytoplasmic face. The first cavity is formed between the core and scaffold domains, about 8 A˚ deep
and measures 10 A˚ by 8 A˚ at the opening. The second adjacent to it is much shallower (
Figure 1d).
The first cavity is highly conserved among decarboxylase sodium pumps, whereas residues in the
second are more variable (
Figure 1—figure supplement 5c–d). This suggests that the first cavity
may be a binding site for the positively charged sodium ion, which should exist in all decarboxylase
sodium pumps.
Additional hints for sodium binding sites come from structural studies of theb subunit homo-
logues. Sodium or sodium-mimicking ions have been observed in structures of CitS (
Kim et al.,
2017; Wo¨ hlert et al., 2015), NhaP (Wo¨ hlert et al., 2014) and ASBT (Hu et al., 2011). A sodium
binding site is located between the tips of helical hairpins in CitS and at the equivalent positions in

NhaP and ASBT. In theb subunit, the highly conserved H1 and H2 tips meet at the bottom of the
putative sodium binding cavity (Figure 4a). The H1 and H2 tips each contain one residue with polar
or charged side chains, Asp203 and Ser382, respectively. Their side chains point into the space
between the helical hairpin tips (
Figure 4b). Such structure suggests that the Asp203 and Ser382
side chains may participate in sodium binding.
To probe the functions of Asp203 and Ser382 in sodium binding, we introduced the D203A and
S382A substitutions. Gel filtration experiments indicated that neither substitution affected the over-
all structure of theStOAD bg sub-complex (
Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We next determined
their effects on sodium binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The ITC experiments

revealed a Kd of 3.7 mM for sodium binding to the wild typeStOAD bg sub-complex. Remarkably,
the D203A and S382A substitutions completely abolished sodium binding (Figure 4c, Figure 4—fig-
ure supplement 1and Figure 4—source data 1), indicating that the Asp203 and Ser382 side chains
make critical contributions to sodium binding. In line with the previous reports that continuous oxa-
loacetate decarboxylation by OAD requires sodium (
Dimroth, 1982; Dimroth and Thomer, 1988)
and a functional b subunit (Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996; Jockel et al., 2000a; Jockel et al.,
2000b), our activity assays indicated that these substitutions also severely inhibited oxaloacetate
decarboxylation by StOAD. Whereas detergent-solubilized wild type StOAD bg sub-complex
strongly stimulated oxaloacetate decarboxylation by thea subunit in the presence of sodium, such
activity of the substitutedStOAD bg sub-complexes was lost (Figure 4dand Figure 4—source data
2).
In SeCitS, a second sodium ion is bound near the tip of its helical hairpin 2. It is coordinated by
polar groups in helical hairpin two and the nearby Ser427 side chain (Wo¨ hlert et al., 2015). The resi-
due equivalent to Ser427 in theStOAD b subunit is the highly conserved Asn412 (Figure 4b). To
probe the function of the Asn412 side chain in sodium binding, we introduced the N412A substitu-
tion, which did not affect the overall structure of theStOAD bg sub-complex (
Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 2). We found that this substitution caused more than 60% reduction in the heat generated
in ITC experiments and a 3.5-fold increase inKd (Figure 4c, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and
Figure 4—source data 1), which suggests a significant change in sodium binding thermodynamics.
It also severely inhibited oxaloacetate decarboxylation byStOAD (Figure 4dand Figure 4—source
data 2). Together, these data indicate an important role of the Asn412 side chain in sodium binding.
OAD transports two sodium ions per reaction cycle (Dimroth and Thomer, 1993) and itsb sub-
unit likely contains two sodium binding sites (Jockel et al., 2000b). The spatial locations of the
Asp203, Ser382 and Asn412 side chains (Figure 4b) suggest that Asp203 and Ser382 contribute to
the first sodium binding site, and Asn412 contributes to the second. InSeCitS, sodium ions bind to
the second site only when the first is occupied (Wo¨ hlert et al., 2015). Our data showed that the
D203A and S382A substitutions severely inhibited sodium binding and the N412A substitution had a
milder effect, suggesting that the two sodium binding sites in the OADb subunit are also occupied
sequentially, consistent with the reported cooperative binding of two sodium ions to
OAD (
Jockel et al., 2000b).
In our structure, the putative sodium binding sites are accessible from the cytoplasm but not the
periplasm (Figure 4a). This indicates that the structure captured theb subunit in the inward-open
conformation.
Mutagenesis screen for essential residues in theb subunit
In many biotin-dependent enzymes, polar or charged amino acid side chains play critical roles in
their carboxyl-transfer reactions in which biotin serves as the carboxyl carrier (
Tong, 2013;
Waldrop et al., 2012). To obtain insights into carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation by theb subunit, we
surveyed b subunit residues with such side chains at the cytoplasmic face, where the carboxyl-biotin
decarboxylation likely take place. We focused on highly conserved residues as functionally important
residues are usually conserved. A total of 17 such residues were found (
Figure 5aand Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 5d). Among them, the equivalents of Thr148, Asp149, Tyr227, Thr318, Arg389,
Asn392 and Ser419 have been characterized in the Klebsiella pneumonia OAD
(KpOAD) (Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996; Jockel et al., 2000a; Jockel et al., 2000b). It was
found that their substitutions did not severely inhibit oxaloacetate decarboxylation
(
Supplementary file 1B). In addition, side chains of Arg250, Glu298 and Asn315 are minimally
exposed to solvent (Figure 5a) and may not play significant roles in carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation.
After excluding these residues, as well as Asp203, Ser382 and Asn412 that we have characterized in
the previous section, we probed the functions of Glu40, Arg258, Arg304 and Asn311 with
mutagenesis.
We introduced the Glu40, Arg258, Arg304 and Asn311 to alanine substitutions. None of the sub-
stitutions were found to affect the overall structure of theStOAD bg sub-complex (
Figure 1—figure
supplement 2). We next accessed their effects on oxaloacetate decarboxylation (Figure 5band Fig-
ure 5—source data 1) and sodium binding (Figure 5c, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Fig-
ure 5—source data 2). A severe inhibition of oxaloacetate decarboxylation was observed for the
E40A substitution. This substitution also moderately reduced the affinity to sodium and caused a

2.6-fold increase inKd. The R258A substitution had little effects on either oxaloacetate decarboxyl-
ation or sodium binding. The R304A and N311A substitutions moderately inhibited oxaloacetate
decarboxylation. Both substitutions caused a 3-fold increase in the sodium concentration for half-
maximum activity (C
1/2); the N311A substitution also reduced the maximum activity more than 40%.
Neither of them had strong effects on sodium binding. Together, these data suggest that the Glu40
side chain is critical for the carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation by theb subunit but does not make sig-
nificant contributions to its sodium binding, the Arg304 and Asn311 side chains are also important,
the Arg258 side chain is unlikely to play a major role.
Effect of pH on sodium binding to theStOAD bg sub-complex
During the OAD catalysis, theb subunit acquires a proton from the periplasm and donates it to car-
boxyl-biotin decarboxylation (
Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996; Dimroth and Thomer, 1983). To
test if proton and sodium binding to theb subunit affects each other, we repeated our ITC experi-
ments at pH ranging from 5.55 to 8.45, corresponding to nearly 1000-fold change in proton concen-
tration. We found that sodium binding is significantly affected by pH (
Figure 6—figure supplement
1a–b and Figure 6—source data 1). Decreasing the pH from 8.45 to 5.55 increased theKd more
than 2-fold (Supplementary file 1C). TheKd value is largely unaffected by different choices of buffer
(Supplementary file 1C), suggesting that the observed effect is primarily due to differences in

proton concentration. The Kd value increases linearly with increasing proton concentration
(Figure 6a and Figure 6—source data 2 ), consistent with competitive binding of proton and
sodium (Leone et al., 2015). Our structural and binding data suggest that sodium ions bind to a cav-
ity in the cytoplasmic face of the inward-openb subunit (Figure 4a–c). Our cryo-EM and crystallo-
graphic studies performed at pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively, captured theb subunit in the inward-
open conformation, suggesting that it is the preferred conformation in our experimental conditions
over a large pH range. Together, these data suggest that proton and sodium compete for binding
to same cavity in the inward-open b subunit. Absolute dissociation constants for binding in the
absence of competitors can be derived from fitting the data to the competitive binding
model (
Hariharan and Guan, 2017; Leone et al., 2015). Our data indicated that the absolute disso-
ciation constants for sodium (KD(Na+)) and proton (KD(H+)) are 0.81 ± 0.03 mM and 1.9 ± 0.2 mM,
respectively (Figure 6a). The pKa for the b subunit proton-binding group calculated from the loga-
rithm of KD(H+) is 5.73. A similar effect is observed for the E40A substitutedStOAD bg sub-complex
(Figure 6a, Figure 6—figure supplement 1c, Figure 6—source data 1 and Supplementary file
1C).
In a number of previous studies to characterize the sodium/proton competition for membrane
protein binding, ITC experiments performed at the same pH revealed a strong correlation between
the sodium binding enthalpy and buffer protonation enthalpy (
Hariharan and Guan, 2017 ;
Leone et al., 2015). In these studies, sodium releases proton from the protein through competition.
The subsequent proton binding to the buffer molecules contributes to the observed correlation. We
also tested a number of buffers with different protonation enthalpies (
Supplementary file
1C; Goldberg et al., 2002), but did not observe such correlation (Figure 6—figure supplement 2a–
b and Figure 6—source data 3). The estimated pKa for the b subunit proton-binding group sug-
gests that it is close to 50% protonated at pH 5.79, at which pH a group of our ITC experiments
were performed. The lack of correlation suggests that a large fraction of the released proton do not

bind to the buffer molecules. A close inspection of theStOAD b subunit structure revealed a cluster
of four solvent-exposed histidine residues at the periplasmic face (Figure 6—figure supplement 2c).
These histidine residues could provide binding sites for the released proton in our ITC experiments.
Discussion
The putative sodium binding sites we proposed are supported by previous mutagenesis studies on
KpOAD. Consistent with their role in coordinating sodium, it was found that substitutions on the
Asp203 and Ser382 equivalents in KpOAD (Asp203 and Ser382) severely disrupted its
function (
Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996; Jockel et al., 2000b). In addition, our structure indi-
cated that the Ser419 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the Gly201 main chain carbonyl in the
H1 tip (
Figure 4b), suggesting that Ser419 plays a role in stabilizing the first sodium binding site.
Consistent with such a role, it was found that substituting the Ser419 equivalent inKpOAD (Ser419)
with alanine reduced its oxaloacetate decarboxylation activity by 90% (Jockel et al., 2000a).
Our mutagenesis screen identified a number of residues essential for theb subunit’s function,
including Glu40, Asp203, Arg304, Asn311, Ser382 and Asn412 (Figure 5a). Our data suggests that
the Asp203, Ser382 and Asn412 side chains coordinate the sodium ions required for the OAD cataly-
sis. They and side chains of Glu40, Arg304 and Asn311, may have additional functions. For instance,
serval of them may participate in coordinating the biotin moiety, and/or in relaying the proton
required for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation. These residues are all located in the putative sodium-
binding cavity (
Figure 5a). Our ITC experiments suggest that sodium and proton compete for bind-
ing to this cavity (Figure 6a). Together, these data are consistent with a model that carboxyl-biotin
decarboxylation takes place in the sodium-binding cavity. Sodium binding to the cavity could facili-
tate the release of proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation, providing an explanation for the
sodium requirement for continuous oxaloacetate decarboxylation by OAD (
Dimroth, 1982). How-
ever, it remains to be established that the proton competes with sodium for binding is the same pro-
ton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation, and the possibility that this reaction takes place elsewhere
cannot be ruled out. To pinpoint the location of carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and understand the
functional roles of the important residues we identified a clear picture of how carboxyl-biotin inter-
acts with theb subunit is required.
Both inward- and outward-open conformations have been captured by structural studies on sev-
eral sodium transporters including CitS (
Kim et al., 2017 ; Wo¨ hlert et al., 2015 ),
NapA (Coincon et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013) and NhaP (Paulino et al., 2014; Wo¨ hlert et al.,
2014). These studies revealed that an ‘elevator-like’ motion of their substrate binding domain
against their scaffold domain transports the substrates across the membrane (Drew and Boudker,
2016). Their substrate binding and scaffold domains are homologous to the core and scaffold
domains in the StOAD b subunit, respectively. In theStOAD b subunit, the interface between the
core and scaffold domains are primarily composed of hydrophobic residues, which could facilitate a
similar elevator-like motion. In addition, our data suggests that sodium ions probably bind to equiva-
lent locations in theStOAD b subunit, CitS and NhaP. These data suggest that the OADb subunit
may also utilize a similar ‘elevator mechanism’ for sodium transport (
Figure 6b). The competition of
sodium and proton for binding to the inward-openb subunit (Figure 6a) is consistent with a model
that the ‘elevator’ movement also transport the proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation in the
opposite direction (
Figure 6b). Our model is consistent with the reported reversibility of decarboxyl-
ase sodium pumps (Dimroth and Hilpert, 1984), and may provide a mechanism for the observed
inside/outside sodium exchange by OAD in the absence of pyruvate and oxaloacetate (Dimroth and
Thomer, 1993). In this condition the enzyme cannot catalyze functional cycles, either forward or
backward; however, the b subunit can interconvert between sodium-bound outward- and inward-
open conformations, and thus catalyze the passive exchange of sodium across the membrane.
Our ITC experiments and proposed OAD reaction cycle suggest a precise coordination of the
OAD components during the reaction. Under most physiological conditions, the sodium concentra-
tion exceeds the proton concentration a million- to a billion- fold. The absolute dissociation con-
stants for proton and sodium determined by our ITC experiments differ less than 500-fold.
Therefore, under most physiological conditions, the inward-open b subunit is prone to lose the
bound proton due to competitive sodium binding. If it is the same proton for carboxyl-biotin decar-
boxylation, our model suggests that the inward proton transport by theb subunit (state 5 to 1

Research article Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics
depicted in Figure 6b) is accompanied by a synchronized carboxyl-biotin transfer to theb subunit,
or the proton is lost to solution by competitive sodium binding.
Based on conservation and predicted locations in the protein, a number of residues in the
KpOAD b subunit have been selected for mutagenesis studies (Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996;
Jockel et al., 2000a; Jockel et al., 2000b). Combining the mutagenesis data and our structure pro-
vided insights into their function (Figure 6—figure supplement 3aand Supplementary file 1B). In
addition to Asp203 and Ser382, it was found that substitutions on Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377 in the
KpOAD b subunit also severely affected its function (
Jockel et al., 2000a; Jockel et al., 2000b). The
equivalent residues in theStOAD b subunit are Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377. The Tyr229 side chain in
T5 forms a hydrogen bond with the Leu343 main chain carbonyl in the nearby T9 (Figure 6—figure
supplement 3b). The Asn373 side chain N-terminal to H2 forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu249
main chain carbonyl C-terminal to T5 (Figure 6—figure supplement 3c). Gly377 in H2 packs against
T9 and the space between them cannot accommodate an amino acid side chain (Figure 6—figure
supplement 3d). Therefore, Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377 are important for the proper folding of the
core domain. Substitutions on these residues likely disrupt the function of theb subunit by distorting
its structure.
The extensive interactions between the b and g subunits suggest that they form a similar
b3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer in the OAD holoenzyme. In a recent study onVcOAD2, blue native PAGE
analysis of the complex revealed multiple species; two species with molecular weights of 530 kDa
and 750 kDa were found to contain all three subunits (
Balsera et al., 2011). These two species may
represent bg sub-complexes associated with different numbers ofa subunits, suggesting that the
association of thea subunit and thebg sub-complex is dynamic. Our blue native PAGE experiments
of the anti-HA agarose-purifiedStOAD complex also revealed species of similar molecular weights
(Figure 3—figure supplement 1h), although it remains to be seen whether they contain thea sub-
unit. Theg subunit C-terminal tail binds to thea subunit with a 1:2 molar ratio (Balsera et al., 2011),
suggesting that theb3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer can bind up to 6a subunits. Thea subunit consists of
CT, AD and BCCP domains. The isolated a subunit is dimeric (Balsera et al., 2011), probably
through dimeric interactions of its CT domain (Studer et al., 2007). In our structure, the last residue
visible in the threeg subunits (Phe43) are located~65 A˚ apart. A simple modeling indicates that
three a subunit dimers can simultaneously interact with the threeg subunit C-terminal tails in the
b3x03B3g3 hetero-hexamer (Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). The modelled a subunits dimerize
through their CT domains. One of the AD domains in eacha subunit dimer interacts with theg sub-
unit C-terminal tail. The model suggests that interactions between thea subunit dimers may also
exist and play a role in stabilizing the OAD complex, consistent with a recent study that the isolated
g subunit C-terminal tail promotes the formation ofa subunit tetramers (
Balsera et al., 2011). It was
suggested by that study that thea subunit tetramerization is mediated by the AD domains in differ-
ent a subunit dimers. In theg subunit, the predicted amphipathic helix that likely interacts with the
AD domain (Balsera et al., 2011) is linked to the transmembrane helix with a 20-residues linker (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1b). This linker could provide flexibility and allow the AD domains in dif-
ferent a subunit dimers to interact (Figure 6—figure supplement 4).
The OAD holoenzyme could provide a platform to facilitate potential coordination of its compo-
nents. For instance, theg subunit interacts with both the core and scaffold domains in theb subunit
(Figure 1a). In the proposed ‘elevator’ movement for sodium transport, the relative orientation of
the core and scaffold domains changes drastically ( Figure 6b). A synchronous conformational
change in theg subunit is expected, which may be in turn coupled to conformational changes in the
a subunit. Such synchronization of the a and b subunits may play a role in coordinating their
activities.
Our study provided important insights into OAD’s function. However, a full understanding of the
molecular mechanism requires extensive future studies. The ‘elevator mechanism’ we proposed is
largely based on structural homologies to CitS and other transporters, which needs to be verified
and improved by additional structures of theb subunit at different stages in the reaction cycle. Struc-
tural studies of theb subunit in complex with biotin and other substrates are needed to elucidate
where carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation takes place and how it drives the sodium transport. Impor-
tantly, how oxaloacetate decarboxylation is coupled to sodium transport is poorly understood. Struc-
tural studies of the OAD holo-enzymes could provide valuable insights into this process.

kanamycin and 100 mg/liter ampicillin, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG, Bio Basic) at 16˚C for 16 hr. 15 mg/liter of D-biotin was supplemented prior to induction. Har-
vested cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM sodium chloride, 2 mMb-
mercaptoethanol (b-ME) and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) with an AH-2010 homog-
enizer (ATS Engineering). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 15 min, and mem-
brane fractions were collected by additional centrifugation at 200,000 g for 1 hr. Membrane protein
were extracted by incubating the membrane fraction with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,
300 mM sodium chloride, 2 mMb-ME, 0.2 mM PMSF and 1% DDM for 12 hr at 4˚C. After clearing
the suspension by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 g for 30 min, extractedStOAD was purified with
Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) and size exclusion (Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) col-
umns, concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride,
2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.02% DDM, flash cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at/C0 80˚C. A
gel shift assay indicated that thea subunit in the purifiedStOAD complex was fully biotinylated.
To purify theStOAD bg sub-complex, the sodium chloride concentration in the Ni-NTA-purified
StOAD was reduced to 100 mM and the solution was loaded to a Hitrap Q column (GE Healthcare).
Pure StOAD bg sub-complex was collected from the flow-through, and further purified by Hitrap
Heparin (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion (Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) col-
umns. The purified complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH
7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM DTT and 0.02% DDM, flash cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored
at /C0 80˚C.
To purify theStOAD a subunit from cells expressing theStOAD complex, the soluble fraction of
the cell lysate was incubated with monomeric avidin agarose (Pierce). Bound protein was eluted with
the lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mM D-biotin.
To purify theStOAD a subunit for activity assays, the corresponding gene fragment was inserted
into vector pET28a. The plasmid was co-transformed with thebirA-containing plasmid into theE.
coli strain BL21 star (DE3). After supplementing 15 mg/liter of D-biotin, the cells were induced with
0.5 mM IPTG at 16˚C for 16 hr. Fully biotinylated 6x Histidine taggedStOAD a subunit was purified
with Ni-NTA and size exclusion (Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL) columns, concentrated to 10 mg/
ml in a buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 0.02% DDM, flash cooled in liq-
uid nitrogen and stored at/C0 80˚C.
To construct the expression plasmid for theStOAD b/CitS variant, gene fragments for theSeCitS
residues 1–79 and 238–319 were codon optimized for expression inE. coli and synthesized (Gene-
wiz). These fragments were used to replace gene fragments forStOAD b subunit residues 1–39 and
247–300 in theStOAD expression construct, respectively. A HA-coding oligonucleotide was added
to the 5’ end of the coding region for theb/CitS variant or the wild typeb subunit. To purify the HA-
tagged StOAD or theb/CitS variant, membrane fraction of cell lysates from cells expressing the cor-
responding complexes were incubated with anti-HA agarose (Pierce), and bound protein was eluted
with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% DDM and 2 mg/ml
HA peptide (Sangon Biotech).
Amino acid substitutions were generated with the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies) and ver-
ified by DNA sequencing. The substituted complexes were expressed and purified following the
same protocol for the wild type complex.
Blue native PAGE
Blue native PAGE was performed with the precast NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel (4–16%, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s directions. All samples were exchanged into a buffer
containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 20 mM sodium chloride and 1% DDM before loaded to the gel.
NativeMark unstained protein standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as the molecular weight
marker.
Antibodies
The anti-HA Rabbit mAb (3724S, Cell Signaling Technology) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
linked anti-rabbit IgG (7074P2, Cell Signaling Technology) anti-bodies were used to detect the HA

dine tag.

Dynamic light scattering
Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt
Technologies) at 25˚C. TheStOAD bg sub-complex was characterized at a concentration of 36mM, in
a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM DTT and 0.02% DDM. Data
was analyzed with the DYNAMICS V6 software (Wyatt Technologies).
Structure determination and analysis
To prepare grids for cryo-EM studies, 3ml of StOAD bg sub-complex were applied to a glow-dis-
charged 400-mesh holy carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3, Cu). After blotting away excess sample by
filter paper for 3.5 s in an automatic plunge device (Leica EMGP), the grids were flash plunged into
liquid ethane. Cryo-EM data was collected on a Titan Krios G2 transmission electron microscope
equipped with a direct detector with GIF quantum energy filter (K2 summit). The grids were imaged
at super resolution mode with a magnification of 105,000, yielding a pixel size of 0.68 A˚. The energy
filtered mode was used with a 20 eV slit inserted. A total dose of 50 electrons/A˚
2 from 9.25 s expo-
sure was dose fractionated into 32 frames. The defocus of collected micrographs ranges from 1mm
to 3.5mm. The beam-induced motion was corrected by MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017). The defo-
cus and astigmatism parameters were estimated by CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015).
56,052 particles were picked by e2boxer.py (Tang et al., 2007) from a sub-dataset. The featured 2D
class averages produced by RELION (Scheres, 2012) 2D classification were used as references for
automatic particle picking by RELION, which picked 260,982 particles from 821 selected micro-
graphs (without dose weighting). After two rounds of reference-free 2D classification, six good clas-
ses with 129,525 particles were selected for further data processing. The initial model was built by
StartCSym in EMAN (
Ludtke et al., 1999) with C3 symmetry imposed. In the 3D classification with-
out imposing symmetry, only one good class with 75,699 particles were selected for 3D refinement.
These particles were re-extracted from dose-weighted micrographs and were refined with C3 sym-
metry imposed. The resolution of the final reconstruction is 3.88 A˚, determined by gold standard
Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) at cut-off 0.143 with post-process in RELION. An initial structure of
the StOAD bg sub-complex was built with EMBUILDER (
Zhou et al., 2017). The structure was com-
pleted with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refined with real space refinement implemented
in PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010). Local resolution was calculated with ResMap (Kucukelbir et al.,
2014). Structural homologues were identified with the Dali server (Holm and Rosenstro¨ m, 2010).
The purifiedStOAD complex crystallized with vapor diffusion. The reservoir solution contains 100
mM sodium chloride, 100 mM lithium sulfate, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 25% polyethylene gly-
col (PEG)1000 and 0.125% PEG400. SDS PAGE analysis of the crystals indicated that they do not
contain the a subunit. A diffraction data set to a resolution of 4.4 A˚ was collected at the Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline BL17U1, at the wavelength 0.979 A˚, and processed with the
HKL2000 package (
Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The crystals belong to space group C2221 and
contain 3b and 3g subunits in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was determined with molec-
ular replacement with MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997), using the cryo-EM structure as the
search model. Structural refinement was carried out with PHENIX.
Isothermal titration calorimetry
ITC experiments were performed on an ITC 200 instrument (MicroCal) at 25˚C. To access the effects
of theb subunit substitutions on sodium binding, theStOAD bg sub-complex was exchanged into a
solution containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 0.02% DDM. To access the effects of
pH and buffer on sodium binding, theStOAD bg sub-complex was exchanged into a solution con-
taining 20 mM of the specified buffer, 100 mM potassium chloride and 0.02% DDM. The buffers
used in this study were Mes pH 5.55, Mes pH 5.75, Tris pH 8.45, Citrate pH 5.79, Mes pH 5.79, Bis-
Tris pH 5.79, Pipes pH 7.2, Hepes pH 7.2, Tris pH 7.2, Hepes pH 8.2, Tricine pH 8.2 and Tris pH 8.2.
Hydrochloric acid and tetramethylammonium hydroxide were used to adjust the pH. To characterize
sodium binding, theStOAD bg sub-complex at a concentration of 120mM was transferred to a 200
ml cell. A solution with 50 mM sodium chloride in the matching buffer was injected into the cell, 2ml
at a time.
ITC data were analyzed with ORIGIN 7.0 (Originlab). The OADb subunit contains two sodium
binding sites (
Jockel et al., 2000b), which are probably not identical judging from our structure

(Figure 4b). However, the thermograms of our ITC experiments appear to be uniphasic, making
data fitting with more than one set of binding sites difficult (Brautigam, 2015). We fitted the data to
the one set of sites model, with the stoichiometry number fixed to 2. In our ITC experiments the
Wiseman ‘c’ parameter is significantly smaller than one and it is very difficult to increase it due to dif-
ficulties in concentrating theStOAD bg sub-complex sample. In this situation, fixing the stoichiome-
try number to a known value can restrain data fitting and obtain more accurate results (
Turnbull and
Daranas, 2003).
Oxaloacetate decarboxylation byStOAD
Oxaloacetate decarboxylation was monitored by following the absorption change at 265 nm due to
oxaloacetate (extinction coefficient: 0.95 mM
/C0 1cm/C0 1) (Dimroth, 1986) on an ultraspec 2100 pro
spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). The light path length is 1 cm. TheStOAD bg sub-complex were
exchanged into a buffer containing 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 0.02% DDM before
the experiment. The reaction mixture contains 300 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM oxaloacetate, 0.79mM 6x
Histidine tagged StOAD a subunit, 5 mM StOAD bg sub-complex and sodium chloride at indicated
concentrations. Data analysis was performed with QTIPLOT (
www.qtiplot.com). The specific activity
is defined as reaction velocity divided by the amount ofStOAD. To determine the values for sodium
concentration at half maximum activity (C1/2) and the maximum specific activity (Vmax), data were fit-
ted to the following equation:
V ¼
Vmax /C0 V0ð Þ Cþ COAD þ C1=2 /C0
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ
Cþ COAD þ C1=2
/C0 /C1 2
/C0 4CCOAD
q/C18 /C19
2COAD
þ V0
Additional symbols in the equation stand for specific activity (V), specific activity at zero sodium
concentration (V0), sodium concentration (C), StOAD concentration (C OAD). This equation was
deduced by assuming thatStOAD saturated by sodium has a maximum specific activity Vmax, and
sodium binds toStOAD with aKd that equals to C1/2.
