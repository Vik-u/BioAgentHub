Abstract 
Tolvaptan is an effective treatment for hyponatremia, but concerns about hepatotoxicity, mainly from high-dose, long-term use in 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, have limited its widespread application. This study aimed to assess the efficacy 
and hepatic safety of short-term, low-dose tolvaptan in hospitalized patients with severe hyponatremia, in comparison with 3% 
hypertonic saline. We retrospectively evaluated 236 hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 125 mEq/L). 
A total of 118 patients received oral tolvaptan (15 mg/day for ≥ 4 days), while 118 received only 3% hypertonic saline. Changes 
in serum sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], bilirubin) were analyzed over time. Liver enzymes were evaluated separately in subgroups with normal and 
elevated baseline values. Both treatment groups exhibited significant increases in serum sodium over time (P < .001). At the 24th 
and 72nd hours, sodium levels were higher in the tolvaptan group (P = .042). Among patients with normal liver enzymes at baseline, 
transient fluctuations in AST and ALT were observed, without clinically significant elevations. In those with elevated baseline 
values, AST and bilirubin levels showed improvement, while ALT remained stable. No cases of clinically apparent hepatotoxicity 
were reported. Short-term, low-dose tolvaptan is effective in correcting severe hyponatremia and does not appear to adversely 
affect liver function, even in patients with preexisting liver enzyme elevations. These findings support its use as a safe and practical 
therapeutic alternative in select hospitalized patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations.

1. Introduction
The most prevalent electrolyte disorder leading to hospitaliza -
tion is hyponatremia, with the non-osmotic secretion of antid -
iuretic hormone (ADH) being accountable for its pathogenesis 
in 95% of cases. [1] Patients undergo assessment based on the 
etiology of hyponatremia, clinical characteristics, and labora -
tory parameters, and treatment strategies are devised, incor -
porating fluid restriction, isotonic or 3% hypertonic sodium 
replacement, and ADH receptor antagonists. The syndrome 
of inappropriate antidiuresis stands as one of the prevalent 
manifestations of hyponatremia. It represents an imbalance 
in sodium and water regulation, marked by compromised 
urine dilution and hypotonic hyponatremia. Notably, it occurs 
without underlying kidney pathology or any discernible non-  
osmotic trigger for ADH release, and its diagnosis relies on an 
exclusionary algorithm.[2,3]
Vasopressin receptor antagonists inhibit the action of ADH 
in the collecting duct, leading to water diuresis. These agents 
prove beneficial in managing hyponatremia, particularly in 
cases characterized by elevated urine osmolality and ADH lev -
els.[3] Tolvaptan is an orally administered, selective, non-peptide 
vasopressin receptor antagonist.[4]
Following the SALT studies, which affirmed the efficacy 
and safety of tolvaptan in addressing hyponatremia, it has 
been employed for managing both euvolemic and hypervole -
mic cases of hyponatremia. [5] However, the elevation of liver 
enzymes observed in patients taking tolvaptan during the 
TEMPO study published in 2012 raised safety concerns. [6] 
Consequently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued 
a safety warning regarding the long-term use of tolvap -
tan and its use in patients with liver disease. [7] The TEMPO 
study focused on patients with polycystic kidney disease and

involved the prolonged and high-dose administration of tol -
vaptan. Thus, while monitoring alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin 
levels is advised for high-dose and long-term use of tolvap -
tan, monitoring of these tests is not required for low-dose and 
short-term use. [8]
Although numerous studies have focused on the high-
dose use of tolvaptan, there is a scarcity of data in the liter -
ature regarding its low-dose and short-term use in patients 
hospitalized with hyponatremia. In this study, we retro -
spectively compared patients admitted to our clinic with a 
diagnosis of hyponatremia who were treated with tolvaptan 
to those who received 3% hypertonic saline. Our objective 
was to investigate the impact of low-dose, short-term tol -
vaptan administration on ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels and 
to evaluate its effectiveness by comparing it with 3% hyper -
tonic saline.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and ethical approval
This retrospective observational study was conducted at the 
Antalya Training and Research Hospital, analyzing medical 
records from patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of hypona -
tremia between 2017 and 2022.
The study was approved by the Antalya Training and Research 
Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Decision No: 
5/14, Date: March 03, 2022), and it adhered to the Declaration 
of Helsinki and principles of good clinical practice. The need for 
informed consent was waived due to the retrospective design.
2.2. Patient selection
Inclusion criteria were:
 • Age ≥ 18 years,
 • Documented severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 125 
mEq/L) on admission, and
 • Availability of daily laboratory data for at least 3 consecu-
tive days during treatment and follow-up.
Exclusion criteria included pseudo-hyponatremia, hypovolemic 
hyponatremia, liver cirrhosis, or insufficient laboratory records.
Based on these criteria, 236 patients were included and cate -
gorized into 2 groups: 118 patients treated with oral tolvaptan 
(15 mg/day for a minimum of 4 days) and 118 patients who 
received only 3% hypertonic saline.
2.3. Treatment protocol
The tolvaptan group received 15 mg once daily for at least 4 
consecutive days during hospitalization. The control group 
received 3% hypertonic saline infusion at individualized doses 
based on clinical judgment and sodium monitoring. No patient 
in either group received combination therapy. Standard support-
ive care was provided to all patients.
2.4. Outcomes and laboratory measures
The primary effectiveness outcome was change in serum sodium 
levels over time. The secondary safety outcome was the change 
in liver function tests (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin) evaluated 
at baseline, on the fourth day of treatment, and the third day 
post-treatment.
Patients in the tolvaptan group were further subcategorized 
based on baseline liver enzyme levels into (a) normal and (b) 
elevated groups, using the following cutoffs: AST > 50 U/L, 
ALT > 50 U/L, and total bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL.
Additional laboratory parameters analyzed included 
serum potassium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. 
Clinical variables such as age, gender, type of hyponatremia 
(euvolemic vs hypervolemic), and length of hospital stay 
were also recorded.
2.5. Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using IBM Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences Statistics, version 26.0 (IBM Corp., 
Armonk). The distribution of continuous variables was assessed 
using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Data were presented as 
mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), as 
appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts 
and percentages.
Group comparisons for continuous variables were per -
formed using the Independent Samples t test or the Mann–
Whitney U test, based on data distribution. Categorical 
variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher 
exact test. Within-group changes over time were analyzed 
using the Friedman test for non-parametric data. Between-
group repeated measures were compared using two-way 
repeated measures ANOVA. Statistical significance was defined 
as a P-value < .05.
3. Results
The median age of 236 patients was 74 (range 65–82) years, 
and the median length of stay was 9 (range 7–11) days. The 
percentage of women participants was 53.4%. Among the 
patients, 30.5% had hypervolemic hyponatremia, while 69.5% 
had euvolemic hyponatremia. The length of hospital stay was 
significantly longer in patients receiving tolvaptan treatment (9 
[8–15] days compared to 8 [7–9] days; P < .001). Median age 
values were similar between the 2 groups ( P = .127). The pro-
portion of female patients was significantly higher in the 3% 
hypertonic saline treatment group than in the tolvaptan group 
(P = .037) (Table 1).
It was observed that the sodium levels of patients receiv -
ing both tolvaptan and 3% hypertonic treatment increased

significantly over time ( P < .001). Meanwhile, potassium lev -
els showed a statistically significant increase during treatment 
for the group receiving the 3% hypertonic solution ( P = .009) 
(Table 2).
Analysis of the changes in laboratory findings over time 
according to treatment groups highlighted a significant decrease 
in sodium levels (P = .042). The sodium values on the 24th hour 
and the 72nd-hour post-treatment were higher in the tolvaptan 
group, while they remained lower on other days. No significant 
differences were found in the changes in potassium, blood urea 
nitrogen, and creatinine levels over time between the treatment 
groups (Table 3).
When the changes in AST, ALT, and total bilirubin values 
over time were examined in patients using tolvaptan who had 
normal liver function tests before treatment, significant changes 
were observed in AST ( P = .005) and ALT ( P = .031) values, 
while total bilirubin values remained unchanged ( P = .364). 
In patients with elevated initial test results, significant changes 
were identified in AST ( P < .001) and total bilirubin ( P = .049) 
levels, but no significant change was observed in ALT levels 
(P = .123) (Table 4).
4. Discussion
In our study, both tolvaptan and 3% hypertonic saline effec -
tively increased serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients 
with severe hyponatremia. The subgroup receiving low-dose, 
short-term tolvaptan demonstrated comparable, and in some 
timepoints superior, sodium correction compared to 3% saline, 
particularly at the 24th and 72nd hours of treatment. This 
observation aligns with previous findings supporting the effi -
cacy of tolvaptan in correcting hyponatremia through aquaresis, 
particularly in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 
and euvolemic states.[9–11]
Although both treatments resulted in significant sodium ele -
vation over time, our between-group comparison revealed an 
interaction effect (P = .042), indicating a differing trajectory of 
sodium correction rather than a treatment-associated decline. 
This distinction may reflect transient fluctuations in sodium 
kinetics related to pharmacodynamics and patient-specific vol -
ume status.[12]
Tolvaptan’s hepatotoxicity profile, particularly with pro -
longed and high-dose administration, remains a central con -
cern. The TEMPO trial revealed elevations in liver enzymes in 
up to 11% of patients receiving tolvaptan long-term, leading 
to regulatory warnings and restrictions on use in individuals 
with liver disease.[13,14] In contrast, our study provides support -
ive data regarding the hepatic safety of short-term, low-dose 
tolvaptan in an acute inpatient setting. Among patients with 
normal baseline liver function tests, AST and ALT fluctuations 
remained within reference ranges. For those with elevated ini -
tial AST, ALT, or bilirubin levels, follow-up values demonstrated 
stabilization or mild improvement, particularly for AST and 
bilirubin.[15]
Importantly, these biochemical fluctuations did not translate 
into clinical hepatotoxicity. This observation is consistent with 
a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in cir -
rhotic patients with diuretic-refractory ascites, which reported 
no significant hepatotoxic events associated with short-term tol-
vaptan use.[16]
This reinforces the concept that hepatic safety concerns are 
likely dose- and duration-dependent, and may not apply to the 
short-term, low-dose protocols evaluated in our study.[17]
Nonetheless, these findings must be interpreted with cau -
tion due to potential baseline imbalances between treatment 
groups. The tolvaptan group had a significantly longer hos -
pital stay, which may reflect higher disease severity or more 
complex clinical scenarios. Additionally, there was a gender 
imbalance, with a greater proportion of female patients in the 
3% hypertonic saline group. Since liver enzyme profiles and 
pharmacokinetics can differ by sex and clinical burden, these 
unadjusted differences could confound the interpretation of 
treatment-related effects. A lack of multivariable regression 
analysis to adjust for these confounders is a limitation of our 
study design.
From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that short-
term use of low-dose tolvaptan represents a viable therapeutic 
alternative for correcting severe hyponatremia in selected hospi-
talized patients (particularly when fluid overload or rapid cor -
rection is a concern). Unlike hypertonic saline, tolvaptan offers 
oral administration and aquaretic action, which may be advan-
tageous in certain settings such as syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone.[13]
Future prospective studies should be designed to include 
adjustment for key confounders such as comorbidities, sex, and 
hospital stay duration. Moreover, randomized controlled trials 
comparing fixed-duration, low-dose tolvaptan with standard 
treatments would be valuable in defining its optimal clinical use 
and hepatic safety profile.
5. Conclusion
While our study represents the first investigation into tolvap -
tan’s side effects based on AST, ALT, and bilirubin values, it is 
constrained by its retrospective design, omission of patients’ 
accompanying comorbidities, lack of analysis regarding mor -
tality associations, and absence of post-discharge follow-up. 
We have demonstrated that tolvaptan effectively corrects 
hyponatremia when used alone or compared to 3% hyper -
tonic saline. Importantly, our findings indicate that using 
tolvaptan for short durations and at low doses does not 
adversely affect AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels, regardless of 
comorbidities.
