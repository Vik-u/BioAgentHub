Transaminases (TAs) oﬀer an environmentally and economically attractive method for the direct synthesis of
pharmaceutically relevant disubstituted 1-phenylpropan-2-amine derivatives starting from prochiral
ketones. In this work, we report the application of immobilised whole-cell biocatalysts with ( R)-
transaminase activity for the synthesis of novel disubstituted 1-phenylpropan-2-amines. After
optimisation of the asymmetric synthesis, the ( R)-enantiomers could be produced with 88 –89%
conversion and >99% ee, while the (S)-enantiomers could be selectively obtained as the unreacted
fraction of the corresponding racemic amines in kinetic resolution with >48% conversion and >95% ee.
Introduction
Chiral amines can be found as constituents in approximately
40% of all active pharmaceutical ingredients, but are also used
as resolving agents for the separation of enantiomers,
1 thus,
there is a high demand for the synthesis of enantiomerically
pure amines. For the synthesis of chiral amines, several solu-
tions have been developed; however, these methods usually
operate with chiral auxiliaries or metal complexes with chiral
ligands and sometimes suﬀer from low enantioselectivity and
low atom eﬃciency.
2 Biocatalytic approaches via kinetic reso-
lution (employing lipases 3 monoamine oxidases 4 or trans-
aminases5), dynamic kinetic resolution with lipases, 6
deracemisation with monoamine oxidases, 7 or asymmetric
synthesis (employing transaminases,8 amine dehydrogenases9
or imine reductases10) represent appealing alternatives for the
synthesis of enantiopure amines.
Commercial drugs (Fig. 1) containing both enantiomers of
amphetamine and related compounds (1-arylpropan-2-amines)
exist for the treatment of obesity (benzphetamine,1),11,12 Par-
kinson's disease (L-DOPA,13 2; selegiline,14 3), narcolepsy and
attention decit hyperactivity disorder (dextroamphetamine,
4)15,16 and benign prostatic hyperplasia (tamsulosin, 5).17
Furthermore, L-amphetamine [6,( 2R)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine]
has been reported to improve cognitive function in multiple
sclerosis patients.18
The synthesis of enantiopure ( S)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine
derivatives is more explored than of the (R)-amines; however,
chemical and biocatalytic approaches both are reported for the
enantioselective synthesis of
L-amphetamine as well.
Some chemical methods (Scheme 1) for synthesis of L-
amphetamine ( 6) include diastereoselective organocerium

PAPER

Multiple biocatalytic strategies have been developed
employing diﬀerent (coupled) enzymes from various starting
compounds (Scheme 2). Racemic 1-phenylpropan-2-amine can
be enzymatically resolved via lipases (E);
23–26 however, kinetic
resolution only allows a maximum of 50% yield. The asym-
metric reductive amination of carbonyl compounds with TAs (F)
has been one of the main research areas of biocatalytic methods
leading to chiral amines.
27,28 TA-mediated amine syntheses have
been widely reported as a one-enzyme system using a variety of
amine donors without further transformation of the ketone co-
product.
29–33 Furthermore, there were reports on TAs coupled in
cascades with pyruvate-reducing enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) and NADH-regenerating glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH).34,35 Amine dehydrogenases ( G, AmDH) can utilise
ammonia for the synthesis of the desired amines by reductive
amination of the prochiral ketone.
36 Enzyme cascades further
widen the possibilities. Starting from racemic alcohols, ave-
enzyme system applying two enzymes for the synthesis
[alcohol dehydrogenase (H, ADH), AmDH] and three enzymes
[NADP-oxidase, catalase, and formate dehydrogenase (FDH)] for
cofactor regeneration allowed the synthesis of the desired (R)-
amines in near quantitative yields.
37 An in vitro hydrogen-
borrowing amination combining whole-cells with ADH and
AmDH activity were applied in tandem operation,
38 and was
further developed to operate inE. coli cells co-expressing the
two enzymes as well.39 This approach was also improved by
employing a mutant AmDH,36 or by a sustainable immobilized
system containing AmDH and GDH.40 Furthermore, ketoximes
in a one-pot cascade consisting of laccases (I) and TAs (F) gave
the desired compounds as well, although in this case, the
starting materials were prepared from the ketone derivatives.
41
Immobilisation of the biocatalysts can improve productivity,
as the immobilised forms can have enhanced stability and can
be reused in multiple catalytic cycles.
42–44 Furthermore, whole-
cell immobilisation combines the benets of elimination of
the high costs of enzyme purication and the possibility of
reuse, thus representing a cost-e ﬃcient way of employing
biocatalysts.45
Herein, we report the application of immobilized E. coli
whole-cells overexpressing transaminases fromArthrobacter sp.
(ArR-TA and ArRm-TA, natural and engineered, respectively) and
Aspergillus terreus(AtR-TA), the optimisation of the asymmetric
synthesis of (R)-arylpropan-2-amines using 1-phenylpropan-2-
one as model compound, and the kinetic resolution of the
racemic amines providing access to the (S)-enantiomers.
Results and discussion
Our aim was to rst optimise the asymmetric biocatalysis
providing (R)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine (8a) from prochiral 1-
phenylpropan-2-one (7a) with the aid of our sol– gel immobi-
lised whole-cell TA biocatalysts. 46,47 Additional goal was to
extend the transamination with (R)-selective TAs to three further
disubstituted derivatives (7b–d) as well (Scheme 3). Finally, to
gain access to the (S)-enantiomers of the four amines by the (R)-
selective TAs, we also investigated the kinetic resolution of all
the racemic amines.
Chemical synthesis of the prochiral 3,4-disubstituted 1-
phenylpropan-2-ones (7b–d) and the corresponding racemic
amines 8a–d

alkylated aldehydes9b–d resulted in the ketones7b–d. Notably,
eﬃcient condensation required the use of freshly prepared
sodium methoxide. Finally, Pd-catalysed transfer hydrogena-
tion from the ketones7a–d resulted in the racemic amines (8a–
d)o fs uﬃcient purity enabling the further operations without
purication.
Reductive amination of 1-phenylpropan-2-one (7a) with (R)-
selective whole-cell TA biocatalysts
The TA-mediated asymmetric synthesis of the (R)-amines was
optimised in the biotransformations of the unsubstituted
ketone 7a. Three immobilised TA-biocatalysts (ArR-TA, ArR
m-
TA, and AtR-TA) were screened in the reductive amination of7a
with seven diﬀerent amine donors including investigation of
the eﬀect of DMSO as cosolvent. To enhance productivity,
substrate concentration was varied as well.
Amine donors. In the asymmetric synthesis, for suﬃciently
high conversions the displacement of the reaction equilibrium
to the product side is necessary.
48 Since certain types of amine
donors can contribute to the equilibrium displacement, the
amine donors have a great impact on the yield. In the one-
enzyme-based TA-systems, three types of amine donors have
been considered (Fig. 2).
Type 1 amine donors are cheap and volatile; thus, these
amines can be used in high excess to shi the reaction equi-
librium towards product formation. Isopropylamine (11) and
racemic sec-butylamine (12) and the corresponding ketones are
low boiling-compounds that can be easily removed by
vacuum.
8,49,50 Although the pool of TAs which accept iso-
propylamine (11) as amine donor is limited, in case of accep-
tance industrial use of11 is preferred compared toL-alanine, as
the forming acetone can be easily removed.51 However, due to
its unfavoured Keq, 11 has to be used in high excess and the
forming acetone shows severe inhibitory eﬀect. As an alterna-
tive, homologoussec-butylamine (12) was shown to be accepted
in racemic form by TAs fromArthrobacter sp.32 and Aspergillus
terreus29 as well. The more favourableKeq with 12 allows use of
the amine donor in smaller excess (e.g. 10 equiv. compared to 50
equiv.52), while the forming methyl ethyl ketone co-product is
still volatile and doesn't show severe reaction inhibition.
The Type 2 amine donors [ethanolamine (13), ethylenedi-
amine (14), diethylenetriamine ( 15)] can be considered as
‘smart’ co-substrates, where a coupled tautomerisation, dimer-
isation, or cyclisation of the carbonyl co-product to non-
inhibiting co-products cause the equilibrium displacement.53
In case of Type 3 amine donors [allylamine (16) and ben-
zylamine (17)], the forming carbonyl-compounds are energeti-
cally favoured due to conjugation of the carbonyl moiety to the
C]C double bond or to the phenyl group.
Initially, the activity of all amine donors with the three TAs
were screened in 10-fold excess (Table 1); however, using
amines 13, 14 and 15 the conversion did not exceed 5% in any
case (not shown in Table 1). The highest conversions could be
achieved with all three (R)-TAs using sec-butylamine as amine

donor, followed by isopropylamine being the second best.
While ArR-TA and AtR-TA resulted in excellent ee in all cases
(>99%), the highly mutated Ar Rm-TA evolved for e ﬃcient
transformation of a bulky substrate did not show perfect
enantioselectivity.
8
Next, the amine donors in lower equivalencies were tested
with the most active enzyme ArR-TA, resulting in the trans-
amination with excellent ee (>99%) but various conversions
(Fig. 3). In this series of investigation, the reactions with 10-fold
excess of amine donors (the usual minimal requirement of Type
1 amine donors, such as isopropylamine11 or sec-butylamine
12) were compared to the reactions with no excess of amine
donors (since smart co-substrates can drive the reaction to
completion even in small excess), and to the ones with 5-fold
excess of amine donors as well. Since in the lower than 10-fold
equivalent amine donor cases the pH of the reaction remained
within the operational range of the ArR-TA, no pH correction
was necessary. The results indicated that reactions with amine
donors 13, 14, 15 and 16 were not suﬃcient for eﬀective
synthetic processes, thus they were not investigated any further.
Unsurprisingly, with benzylamine17 higher conversion could
be achieved than with isopropylamine 11, reaching 75%
conversion at 10-fold excess compared to that of 50% with
isopropylamine. Because sec-butylamine 12 provided the high-
est conversion at any substrate : amine donor ratio (a reason-
able 30.3% conversion could be achieved even with 1 equiv. of
12), the further optimisation was performed with12 as amine
donor. The signicant diﬀerence between IPA (11) and SBA (12)
can be rationalized by the more benecial K
eq, with12 as amine
donor due to the better aﬃnity of the larger 12 to TAs as
compared to11.
Substrate concentration.In the next optimisation series, the
substrate concentration was varied to explore the maximal
concentration providing suﬃciently high conversion (Fig. 4). In
the reactions mediated by ArR-TA and AtR-TA, the conversion
decreased gradually and signicantly with increasing substrate
concentration until <10% at 100 mM, while the ee remained
excellent (>99%) (Fig. 4, panel (a)). In contrast, the evolved
transaminase ArR
m-TA showed enhanced activity at higher
concentrations reaching 89% conversion at 50 mM substrate
concentration (Fig. 4, panel (b)).
Inspection of the substrate loading eﬀect for 7a (Fig. 4)
answered the question whether sol– gel immobilization could
have protecting eﬀect on the substrate/product inhibition of the
transaminase-catalysed reaction. Because the conversions of
the ArR-TA- and AtR-TA-catalysed reactions dropped signi-
cantly – especially with AtR-TA – (Fig. 4a), it is apparent that sol–
gel whole cell immobilization could not protect against
substrate/product and this phenomena seems to be an intrinsic
property of these two TAs (similarly to many other TAs). On the
other hand, substrate inhibition was not a serious issue for
ArR
m-TA (Fig. 4b), because this evolved TA retained its improved
property of avoiding the substrate inhibition in sitagliptin
intermediate production in the transamination of ketone7a as
well.
Although ArR
m-TA could operate with 88% conversion at
100 mM substrate concentration (10-fold increase compared to
the initial tests), the enantiomeric excess remained around
80%. Since ArR
m-TA could not be used in highly enantiotope

Co-solvent. Native enzymes usually operate in aqueous
media; however, examples have been developed for trans-
amination in neat organic solvents,
54,55 including trans-
aminases from Arthrobacter.56–58 To overcome the limited
substrate-solubility issue, 5% DMSO was applied even in the
initial tests. However, to explore the further eﬀect of DMSO on
the immobilized ArR-TA-mediated process, the amination of7a
was more thoroughly examined by adding various amounts of
DMSO up to 25 v/v% to the buﬀer (Fig. 5). Although the highest
conversion of transamination was observed at 15 v/v% DMSO
content (c ¼ 92%), conversions in the 0– 25 v/v% DMSO content
range exceeded 80% in all cases with excellent ee (>99%). In
phosphate buﬀer without DMSO, the amine 7a resulted in
formation of an emulsion, while increasing amounts of DMSO
could harm the enzyme.
59 Thus, the lowest 5 v/v% DMSO
content providing suﬃciently high conversion of7a (c ¼ 87.4%)
was chosen as reaction medium for further experiments.
Transamination of 1-phenylpropan-2-one derivatives 7a–d
The optimized conditions were applied for screening the
synthesis of the disubstituted (R)-phenylpropan-2-amines (8b–
d) mediated by the three selected immobilized whole-cell (R)-TA
biocatalysts (Table 2). With ArR-TA and AtR-TA all the four 1-
phenylpropan-2-ones 7a–d were transformed with similar eﬃ-
ciency (the conversions were 88– 89% for ArR-TA and 69– 76% for
AtR-TA). Interestingly, although ArRm-TA was evolved to trans-
form a bulky substrate, this TA variant transformed the
substituted derivatives7b–d with signicantly lower conversion
(<36%) than the non-substituted ketone7a (62%). Enantiotope
selectivity of the ArRm-TA-mediated amination of the smaller
ketones 7a–c was moderate (ee¼ 84.9– 88.5%). Expectedly, the
highest enantiotope selectivity could be achieved in amination
of 7d (ee ¼ 92.7%) due to the increased bulkiness of this
substrate.
To compare the eﬃciency of our TA biocatalysts, an esti-
mated /C24 0.1 recombinant TA-content per mg immobilized bio-
catalyst can be considered (for details, see Experimental
section). However, comparison with previously reported
methods can only made in a qualitative and not quantitative
way. The various methods used the TA biocatalysts in diﬀerent
forms and applied various amine donors as well.
For the transamination of7a, commercially available puri-
ed TAs,
30,60 lyophilized whole cells41 or cell-free extracts (CFEs)
directly29 were applied as TA-biocatalysts. In case of lyophilized
whole cells, 250% w/w TA-biocatalyst was used for transforming
17 mM of7a with 1 M IPA (/C24 60 equiv.) and 1 mM PLP for 24 h at
30 /C14 C.41 TA as CFE (/C24 2 mg protein) was also employed for
conversion of 7a (10 mM) in presence of 5– 10 equiv. amine
donor (L-alanine, IPA, SBA, methylbenzylamine) and 0.1 mM
PLP for 24 h at 30/C14 C.29
The early reports on transamination of molecule7b applied
cells from fermentation broth and de ned the quantity of
catalyst only as whole cells harvested from 100 mL culture
broth.31,32,61 Only one report described the production of (R)-8b
using commercially available TAs,60 using 2 mg of puried (R)-
selective TA in to transform7b (20 mM) with IPA (11, 50 equiv.)
and PLP (1 mM) for 24 h at 30/C14 C in 91% conversion. When the
enzyme load was increased to 1 : 1 w/w TA : substrate ratio, the
amine donor equivalent could be lowered to 16.
Thus, in this work the TA-mediated reactions with already
investigated substrates 7a,b proceeded with similar results as
previously disclosed, and data on novel substrates 7c,d
extended the applicability of the immobilized whole-cell TA
form.
Kinetic resolution of the racemic amines 8a–d
Due to thermodynamic equilibrium reasons in the TA-mediated
processes, kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic amines is more
preferred to perform than asymmetric synthesis, however, at
maximum conversion of the racemic substrate only 50% yield of
the unconsumed enantiomer that can be achieved.
62 Because in
our preliminary screens none of the (S)-selective TAs in our
hands (ArS-TA, VfS-TA, CvS-TAm)47 showed suﬃcient activity in
the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-8a–d, these (S)-amines were

materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,

ruhe, Germany).
Biocatalysts. The immobilized whole-cell TA biocatalysts
(AtR-TA, ArR-TA, and ArR
m-TA) were prepared as described in
our previous work.47 Briey, production of AtR-TA, ArR-TA, and
ArRm-TA was achieved in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the
recombinant pET21a plasmid with the gene of the given TA.63
The E. coli cells containing the overexpressed TAs and hollow
silica microspheres as supporting agent were immobilized by
an improved sol– gel process.
47
The TAs used had high expression level (/C24 40% of all proteins
in the cell, with expressions plasmids using T7 promoter, even
50% recombinant protein content could be achieved).
64 On
average, wet E. coli cell mass contains 200 – 320 mg mL /C0 1
protein,65 and the density of the cells is /C24 1.1 g cm /C0 3.66
Furthermore, it is known from our previous studies that/C24 0.9 g
of such supported whole-cell TA biocatalyst can be produced
from 1 g of wetE. colicells.
46,47 Thus, the estimated recombinant
TA content of 1 g immobilized E. coli cells is /C24 90– 140 mg.
Consequently, our supported whole-cell TA-biocatalysts con-
tained approximately 8– 13% w/w recombinant TA (as a part of
the /C24 20– 33% w/w total protein content).

Calculations. Conversion (c) and enantiomeric excess values
(ee) were determined by GC measurements with base-line
separations of the peaks for the enantiomers of racemic
amines 8a–d (see Section 1.2 in ESI†). The enantiomeric excess
of the enantioenriched forms of amines8a–d was calculated by
the following formula:

PR þ PS
/C2 100;
where eeR is the enantiomeric excess of the (R)-amine, PR and PS
indicate the peak area of the corresponding enantiomer of the
investigated amine8a–d.
The conversion of the racemic amines8a–d in the highly
selective kinetic resolution (ckr) was calculated by the following
equation:

Biotransformations
Statistical analysis on the conversion of the unsubstituted
ketone 7a in transamination reaction could be performed from
5 points: 83.0% (Table 1), 85.5% (Fig. 3), 88.2% (Fig. 4), 88.9%
(Table 2), 87.4% (Fig. 5). Based on these data, standard devia-
tion of the population could be calculated as 2.1% form ¼ 86.6%
as the mean value. Since the SD of conversion was quite
moderate in biotransformation of7a, the further investigations
were performed as single sets of experiments.
Kinetic resolution of racemic amines 8a–d
General method.To a 4 mL screw-capped vial containing KPi
buﬀer (890mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) were added immobilized whole-cell
TA (20 mg), PLP solution (10mL, 100 mM in KPi buﬀer), DMSO
solution of the racemic amine (50mL, 200 mM of8a–d in DMSO), and
sodium pyruvate solution (50mL, 100 mM in KPi buﬀer) and the
resulted mixture was shaken at 450 rpm at 30
/C14 C for 24 h. Then, the

solution (100mL) and EtOAc (500mL). The aqueous phase was sepa-
rated, and the organic phases was dried over anhydrous sodium
sulphate. The conversion from the racemic amine (8a–d)t ok e t o n e
(7a–d) and the enantiomeric excess of the unreacted amine [(S)-8a–d]
were determined by chiral GC [50mL of extracted reaction sample was
derivatised to the corresponding acetamides (by addition of 10mL
acetic anhydride and shaking at 60
/C14 C by 750 rpm for 1 h)]. The results
are summarized in Fig. 6.
Asymmetric synthesis of (R)-8a–d
General method.To a 4 mL screw-capped vial containing KPi
buﬀer (930mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) were added immobilized whole-
cell TA (20 mg), PLP solution (10mL, 100 mM in KPi buﬀer),
DMSO solution of the ketone (50mL, 200 mM of7a–d in DMSO),
and sec-butylamine 12 (10.1 mL, equal to 100 mM in thenal
volume), and the pH 8 was set with 1 M aqueous HCl solution.
Then, the resulted mixture was shaken at 450 rpm and 30/C14 C for
24 h, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 M
aqueous NaOH solution (100 mL) and EtOAc (500 mL). The
aqueous phase was separated, and the organic phases was dried
over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The conversion from the
ketone (7a–d) and the enantiomeric excess of the formed amine
[(R)-8a–d] were determined by chiral GC [50 mL of extracted
reaction sample was derivatised to the corresponding acetamides
(by addition of 10mL acetic anhydride and shaking at 60

Conclusions
This study with three (R)-selective transaminases ofArthrobacter
sp. andAspergillus terreusapplied as immobilized whole-cell bio-
catalysts of the overexpressingE. colicells showed that enantio-
pure drug-like (R)-1-(30,40-disubstituted phenyl)propan-2-amines
(R)-8a–d could be obtained from the corresponding 1-arylpropan-
2-ones (7a–d) by asymmetric transamination, while kinetic reso-
lution with these (R)-selective TAs could provide the (S)-amines (S)-
8a–d from the corresponding racemic amines8a–d.
The 30,40-disubstituted 1-phenylpropan-2-ones (7b–d) have
been synthesised conveniently from vanillin (10) in two steps.
The high-yieldO-alkylations of10 followed by Darzens reaction
gave the desired ketones 7b–d in good yields. The racemic
amines (8b–d) were obtained by Pd-catalysed reductive amina-
tion of7b–d.
The reaction optimisation on model compound7a probing
seven diﬀerent amine donors, and the eﬀect of the substrate
and co-solvent DMSO concentration revealedsec-butylamine as
the most suitable amine donor. While high conversions with
ArR-TA and AtR-TA with excellent selectivity (ee > 99%) could be
achieved only up to 10 mM substrate concentration, the highly
engineered ArR
m-TA provided suﬃciently high conversion even
at 100 mM, albeit with insuﬃcient selectivity (ee/C24 80%).
With ArR-TA as the most versatile biocatalyst in this study,
the (R)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine (8a) was obtained with 92%
conversion and >99% ee employingsec-butylamine as amine
donor under the optimised reaction conditions in 24 h. ArR-TA
catalysed the transamination of all the 3,4-disubstituted
ketones 7b–d as well with equally high conversion (88– 89%) and
excellent selectivity (ee > 99%). In addition, the kinetic resolu-
tion of8a,c,d with AtR-TA could provide the (S)-amines (S)-8a–
d with perfect conversion (>49% in KR) and good selectivity (ee >
95%), only the KR of8b proceeded with lower conversion (c¼
48.2%) and moderate selectivity (ee¼ 92%).
