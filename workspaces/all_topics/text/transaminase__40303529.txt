Abstract
Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly increases the risk and severity of myocardial infarction
(MI), contributing to poor cardiovascular outcomes through oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial
dysfunction.
Methods: This study evaluates the cardioprotective potential of biochanin A (BCA), a naturally occurring
isoflavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in a streptozotocin (STZ) and isoproterenol
(ISO)-induced model of diabetic myocardial infarction (DMI) in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into five
groups, including normal controls, STZ+ISO, and three BCA-treated groups (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg). 
Results: BCA administration significantly improved electrocardiographic parameters by reducing ST height
and QT interval prolongation (p < 0.05). It also reduced myocardial injury markers (lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), creatinine kinase on myocardial bundle (CK-MB), aspartate transaminase (AST), and cardiac
troponin-T (cTn-T)) in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001). BCA normalized blood pressure, heart rate,
and left ventricular function, improving maximum and minimum rate of ventricular contraction (+dP/dt, -
dP/dt) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, BCA significantly decreased blood glucose levels and improved lipid profiles
by lowering total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) while increasing
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (p < 0.001). It suppressed inflammation by reducing tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-
α
, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1
β
 levels (p < 0.01). Oxidative stress markers, including
malondialdehyde (MDA), were reduced, while antioxidant markers such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and catalase were increased (p < 0.001). BCA enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, promoting antioxidant defense. Histopathological analysis confirmed reduced
myocardial injury and improved cardiac architecture. 
Conclusion: These findings highlight BCA’s potential as a therapeutic agent for managing DMI through its
dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from
defects in insulin secretion, action, or both 
[1]
. Among its myriad complications, cardiovascular disease
(CVD) stands as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Myocardial infarction (MI) in the diabetic
population exacerbates this burden, as the presence of diabetes amplifies the severity of infarction, hinders
myocardial repair, and accelerates the progression of heart failure 
[2]
. Diabetic myocardial infarction (DMI)
has a multifactorial etiology, involving disturbances in glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, oxidative
stress, inflammation, and impaired endothelial function 
[3]
. Diabetes impairs myocardial healing by altering
fibroblast function and reducing angiogenesis, leading to poor tissue repair. Despite advancements in
pharmacological interventions, the management of DMI remains suboptimal, necessitating the exploration
of novel therapeutic agents. Additionally, existing therapies have limitations, such as side effects and an
inability to directly target oxidative stress.
Biochanin A (BCA), a naturally occurring isoflavonoid predominantly found in red clover and other legumes,
has emerged as a promising candidate for mitigating various diabetic complications 
[4]
. This polyphenolic
compound has garnered attention due to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective
properties. Notably, BCA has been shown to possess a wide range of biological activities, including the
attenuation of oxidative stress and the modulation of inflammatory pathways, both of which are central to
the pathogenesis of DMI. Preliminary studies suggest that BCA can reduce myocardial injury in various

animal models of MI, although its specific role in DMI remains underexplored.
The hypothesis underlying this study posits that BCA exerts protective effects on the diabetic heart through
its dual actions of combating oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are key contributors to
myocardial injury in diabetes. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, often used in experimental diabetes
research, leads to oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, which are further aggravated by the
addition of isoproterenol (ISO), a potent adrenergic agonist that mimics the pathological conditions of MI.
This combined model of STZ and ISO-induced DMI is a reliable and widely accepted approach to study the
pathophysiology of DMI and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that BCA
can modulate several signalling pathways involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. In vitro and in vivo
studies have demonstrated its ability to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-
κ
B), a key
regulator of inflammation, and its capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
[5,6]
. These actions
potentially attenuate myocardial cell apoptosis, fibrosis, and dysfunction, which are commonly observed in
diabetic heart disease. Additionally, BCA has been reported to improve lipid profiles, enhance endothelial
function, and promote angiogenesis, all of which contribute to better cardiovascular outcomes.
While prior studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of BCA in non-diabetic models of MI, its effects in
the context of DMI remain insufficiently characterized. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the
therapeutic potential of BCA in STZ and ISO-induced DMI in rats, focusing on its ability to modulate
oxidative stress, inflammation, and myocardial damage. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms through
which BCA confers cardioprotection, this research sought to contribute to the development of novel,
natural-based interventions for the management of diabetic heart disease.
Materials And Methods
Chemicals
BCA (≥ 98%) and STZ (≥ 98%) were procured from Sigma Aldrich, USA. The other required chemicals were
purchased of analytical and laboratory grade from local vendors.
Experimental animals and protocol
Male Wistar rats (weighing between 170-200 g) were housed under controlled conditions with a 12-hour
light/dark cycle and humidity of 50-60%. The rats had continuous access to purified water and were
provided with multi-nutritional pellet feed (Nutrimix Laboratory Animal Feed, India). To minimize stress
and ensure humane handling, animals were acclimated to handling procedures before the experiment,
provided with environmental enrichment, and monitored regularly for any signs of distress. The
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of R. C. Patel Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and
Research, Shirpur, India accepted and approved the protocol (CPCSEA/IAEC/RCPIPER/2017/32).
STZ and ISO-Induced DMI in Rats
STZ was dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) to maintain stability and enhance absorption. It was
injected intraperitoneally at 55 mg/kg single dose 
[7]
, whereas ISO was dissolved in normal saline solution
and injected subcutaneously on the 28th and 29th day 
[8,9]
.
Diabetes induction was confirmed by measuring fasting blood glucose levels after 72 hours of STZ injection,
with rats having glucose levels ≥ 250 mg/dL considered diabetic.
Experimental Protocol
A total of 50 male Wistar rats were used in this study. The rats were randomly divided into five groups, with
10 rats in each group. The specifics of each group are outlined below:
About 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and saline solution was used as a vehicle for BCA 
[10,11]
, and
citric acid buffer solution was used for STZ 
[12,13]
.
Group 1. Normal: The rats were administered 0.5% CMC (1 ml/kg/day, orally) via gavage for a duration of
four weeks and four times per week and 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) solution (vehicle of STZ) (1 ml/kg, i.p.).
Group 2. STZ+ISO: The rats were administered 0.5% CMC (1 ml/kg/day, orally) via gavage and STZ (55
mg/kg, single dose i.p.) and ISO (85 mg/kg on 28th and 29th day, subcutaneously).
Group 3. BCA (5 mg/kg, p.o.): Rats were administered STZ (55 mg/kg, single dose i.p.) with BCA (5 mg/kg,
p.o.) for four weeks and ISO (85 mg/kg on 28th and 29th day, subcutaneously). The dose of BCA was decided
based on the previous studies. 
Group 4. BCA (10 mg/kg, p.o.): Rats were administered STZ (55 mg/kg, single dose i.p.) with BCA (10 mg/kg,

p.o.) for four weeks and ISO (85 mg/kg on 28th and 29th day, subcutaneously).
Group 5. BCA (20 mg/kg, p.o.): Rats were administered STZ (55 mg/kg, single dose i.p.) with BCA (20 mg/kg,
p.o.) for four weeks and ISO (85 mg/kg on 28th and 29th day, subcutaneously).
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Hemodynamic Parameters
At the conclusion, the rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.25 g/kg, intraperitoneally). Each animal was
placed in a supine position on an ECG board, and ECG recordings were obtained using a three-lead limb
electrode configuration in accordance with standard preclinical protocols. The ECG recordings were
continuously obtained using a data acquisition system (AD Instruments, Australia) 
[14]
. 
Blood Pressure
The right carotid artery was cannulated, and the blood pressure was measured. Left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (LVEDP) and maximum and minimum rate of ventricular contraction (+dp/dt, -dp/dt) were recorded
using PowerLab (AD Instruments, Australia). 
Estimation of Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile
Blood glucose and lipid profile were measured by using biochemistry methods as per the instructions given
by manufacturers.
Estimation of Cardiac Injury Markers
Serum and plasma were stored at -20°C for subsequent measurement of cardiac injury markers. Levels of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase on myocardial bundle (CK-MB), aspartate transaminase
(AST), and cardiac troponin-T (cTn-T) were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (ERBA
Diagnostics, India) 
[14]
.
Estimation of Oxidative Stress
The total protein content in the heart tissue homogenate was assessed using the Bradford protein assay as
required for further calculations of oxidative stress parameters. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by
measuring the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)
assay). The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the heart tissue was determined. Catalase activity in the
heart tissue was quantified, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was also measured 
[15-17]
.
Estimation of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2
 (
Nrf2)
 
and Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Release
Nrf2, along with the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
α
 and interleukin (IL)-6, was measured using
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, following the manufacturer's instructions
(Abbkine, USA).
Histopathological Examination
The heart tissue was preserved in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde. Specimens were then sectioned into
3-5 
μ
m thick slices, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were
examined under a light microscope (Motic, Canada) for signs of myocardial injury.
Statistical analysis
The data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for each group. Statistical analysis was
conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. The data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad, California, USA).
Results
Effect of BCA on electrocardiographic changes
STZ+ISO-induced MI was associated with significant changes in ST height and QT interval. BCA reduced
elevated ST height at all doses, but not to a significant extent. Whereas, prolongation of the QT interval was
significantly reduced by BCA (p < 0.01) (Figure 
1
).

Effect of BCA on biochemical parameters
Administration of BCA significantly improved biochemical markers associated with DMI. The STZ+ISO
group showed a marked increase in serum LDH, CK-MB, AST, and cTn-T levels, indicating severe myocardial
injury and compromised cardiac function. BCA treatment at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg resulted in a dose-
dependent reduction in these markers. The STZ+ISO group exhibited significantly elevated LDH levels
(58.48 ± 0.96 IU/L) compared to the normal group (25.22 ± 1.69 IU/L, p < 0.001). BCA administration reduced
LDH levels to 28.72 ± 0.90 IU/L (5 mg/kg), 26.16 ± 1.29 IU/L (10 mg/kg), and 40.32 ± 1.50 IU/L (20 mg/kg). The
same was observed in CK-MB levels, which increased significantly in the STZ+ISO group (226.8 ± 16.38
IU/L) versus the normal group (87.75 ± 8.19 IU/L, p < 0.001). BCA at the entire dose range restored CK-MB
levels closer to normal (124.5 ± 10.87 IU/L and 120.1 ± 10.32 IU/L, respectively), indicating significant
cardioprotection (p < 0.001). AST levels in the STZ+ISO group (47.14 ± 1.62 IU/L) were significantly higher
than normal (18.38 ± 0.65 IU/L, p < 0.001). BCA significantly reduced AST levels at all doses. cTn-T levels
were significantly elevated in the STZ+ISO group (29.58 ± 6.36 ng/L) compared to the normal group (5.54 ±
1.88 ng/L, p < 0.01). BCA reduced cTn-T levels to 11.34 ± 3.83 ng/L (20 mg/kg), suggesting improved
myocardial integrity (p < 0.05), as shown in Table

Effect of BCA on hemodynamic parameters
STZ+ISO significantly impaired cardiac function, increasing blood pressure and heart rate while reducing
contractility. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced at all doses of BCA (p < 0.01). Elevated
heart rate in the STZ+ISO group was normalized with BCA treatment (p < 0.05). LVEDP was significantly
elevated in the STZ+ISO group, but BCA restored it in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). +dP/dt and -
dP/dt, the indicators of cardiac contractility, were improved significantly with BCA treatment (p < 0.01)
(Figure

Effect of BCA on blood glucose levels and lipid profile
STZ+ISO treatment caused significant alterations in the lipid profile and blood glucose levels, consistent
with metabolic dysfunction. BCA treatment significantly restored these values toward normal levels. The
STZ+ISO group showed severe hyperglycemia (278.2 ± 7.68 mg/dL) compared to the normal group (63.15 ±
4.26 mg/dL, p < 0.001). BCA significantly lowered blood glucose levels to 133.0 ± 8.80 mg/dL (5 mg/kg), 107.7
± 6.86 mg/dL (10 mg/kg), and 207.3 ± 7.03 mg/dL (20 mg/kg). The high dose of BCA showed a lesser effect
than 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg; this might be due to the feedback mechanism. Total cholesterol (TC) levels
increased significantly in the STZ+ISO group (196.6 ± 7.15 mg/dL) compared to the normal group (114.8 ±
2.99 mg/dL, p < 0.001). BCA reduced TC levels at 5 mg/kg (157.2 ± 6.02 mg/dL) and 10 mg/kg (131.5 ± 7.93
mg/dL) (p < 0.001). Triglycerides (TG) levels increased significantly in the STZ+ISO group (170.4 ± 5.58
mg/dL) compared to normal (74.81 ± 2.09 mg/dL, p < 0.001). BCA lowered TG levels at 5 mg/kg (110.4 ± 7.51
mg/dL) and 10 mg/kg (83.01 ± 4.64 mg/dL) (p < 0.01). Also, BCA significantly reduced low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (Table 
2
).

Effect of BCA on oxidative stress
Markers of oxidative stress, such as MDA, were increased in the STZ+ISO group, while antioxidant markers
like reduced GSH, SOD, and catalase were reduced. MDA levels were elevated in the STZ+ISO group (~150
mg/g of wet tissue). BCA reduced MDA levels at all doses (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis showed that GSH,
SOD, and catalase were increased with BCA treatment, suggesting improved redox balance and reduced
oxidative stress (Figure 
4
).

Effect of BCA on Nrf2 levels
Nrf2 levels, which regulate the antioxidant defense pathway, were significantly reduced in the STZ+ISO
group. BCA increased Nrf2 expression at all doses, indicating enhanced antioxidant response (p < 0.05). The
highest dose of BCA increased the Nrf2, but not to a significant extent (Figure 
5
).

 presents histological images of cardiac tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin from different
experimental groups. The normal group showed well-organized, intact myocardial fibers with clear
striations and minimal interstitial spaces, indicating normal cardiac tissue. The STZ+ISO group revealed
significant myocardial damage, including disorganized muscle fibers, increased interstitial spaces, and
infiltration of inflammatory cells, indicative of myocardial injury. In the BCA (5 mg/kg) group, partial
restoration of myocardial structure was observed, with improved fiber alignment but some residual damage.
The BCA (10 mg/kg) group exhibited more organized muscle fibers with reduced interstitial spaces and
minimal inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting a dose-dependent protective effect. The BCA (20 mg/kg)
group showed nearly normal myocardial architecture with well-organized fibers and minimal damage,
indicating a strong cardioprotective effect at this high dose (Figure 
6
).

Discussion
The present study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of BCA in a rat model of MI induced by
STZ and ISO, with a focus on a range of biomarkers and physiological parameters related to cardiac
function, oxidative stress, and metabolic disturbances. The results demonstrated that BCA treatment,
particularly at the middle and high doses (10 and 20 mg/kg), provided significant improvements across
multiple measured parameters. These findings suggest that BCA possesses potent therapeutic potential in
managing diabetic-induced MI, likely mediated through modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation,
along with the activation of the Nrf2 pathway.
The evaluation of key hemodynamic parameters - systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean
arterial pressure - revealed that BCA treatment effectively improved cardiac function, as evidenced by the
normalization of these parameters in comparison to the STZ+ISO control group. Diabetes and MI often
result in significant alterations in blood pressure regulation, contributing to further cardiac complications
[18]
. These results align with previous studies where natural compounds like flavonoids have demonstrated
the ability to restore normal hemodynamics in the face of oxidative stress and myocardial injury 
[19,20]
.
Additionally, the ECG parameters showed significant improvements following BCA treatment, with
reductions in arrhythmic events that are typically observed in DMI. The improvement in LVEDP further
supports BCA’s beneficial effects on cardiac function, as LVEDP is an indicator of left ventricular compliance
and heart failure progression 
[21,22]
. Biochemical markers such as serum levels of LDH, CK-MB, AST, and
cTn-T were significantly reduced in the BCA-treated rats, suggesting a decrease in myocardial injury and
cellular damage. This observation corroborates the notion that BCA can mitigate the tissue damage induced
by MI, possibly through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties 
[23,24]
. The improvements in the
lipid profile, particularly with reductions in TC, TG, and LDL, and an increase in HDL, further indicate that
BCA plays a role in modulating dyslipidemia, which is a common comorbidity in diabetic CVD. A
dysregulated lipid metabolism in diabetes is known to exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation,
contributing to the progression of myocardial injury 
[25]
. BCA’s effects on lipid metabolism could therefore
be beneficial in reducing the cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes. Moreover, blood glucose levels
were also significantly lower in the BCA-treated groups, which is consistent with previous reports on the
antidiabetic effects of BCA 
[26]
. This suggests that BCA not only improves cardiac outcomes but also has an
indirect role in managing hyperglycemia, a well-established risk factor for myocardial infarction in diabetic
patients.
One of the key mechanisms through which BCA exerts its cardioprotective effects appears to be the
activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Nrf2 is a critical transcription factor that regulates the expression of
antioxidant enzymes and plays a central role in cellular defense against oxidative stress 
[27]
. Our findings of
increased Nrf2 expression in the BCA-treated groups (in post-hoc analysis) indicate that BCA may
counteract the heightened oxidative stress present in DMI by enhancing the cellular antioxidant capacity.
This is in line with the previous literature that highlights the importance of Nrf2 activation in preventing
and ameliorating CVDs, including MI 
[28]
. By promoting Nrf2 signalling, BCA may mitigate the downstream

effects of oxidative stress, including lipid peroxidation, protein damage, and inflammation, all of which
contribute to the pathogenesis of MI in diabetic conditions 
[29]
. Furthermore, the reduction in pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-
α
 observed in the BCA-treated rats further supports the involvement of
anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the protective effects of BCA. TNF-
α
 is a well-known mediator of
inflammation that contributes to myocardial injury and dysfunction, and its reduction in response to BCA
treatment suggests that BCA may attenuate the inflammatory cascade that exacerbates myocardial injury in
diabetic rats 
[30]
. The study highlights that the medium and highest doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of BCA
produced the most pronounced effects across all measured parameters, suggesting a dose-dependent
relationship between BCA administration and its therapeutic efficacy except in some of the parameters like
Nrf2, LDL, HDL, and TNF-
α.
As a limitation, the present study lacks a long-term follow-up to assess the sustained effects of BCA
treatment on cardiac function and overall health. Additionally, while the study provided promising results
on the cardioprotective effects of BCA, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain to
be fully elucidated, and further studies are needed to clarify its precise interactions with other cellular
pathways.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the study presents compelling evidence that BCA provides significant cardioprotective effects
in a rat model of DMI. The improvements in hemodynamic parameters, biochemical markers, lipid profile,
and glucose regulation, along with the potential role of Nrf2 activation and the reduction of IL-6 and IL-1
β
,
indicate that BCA could be a promising therapeutic candidate for managing diabetic cardiovascular
complications.
