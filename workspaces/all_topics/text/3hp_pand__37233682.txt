Abstract: The underlying mechanisms of the development of unhealthy metabolic phenotypes in
obese children and adolescents remain unclear. We aimed to screen the metabolomes of individuals
with the unhealthy obesity phenotype and identify the potential metabolic pathways that could
regulate various metabolic proﬁles of obesity in Chinese adolescents. A total of 127 adolescents aged
11–18 years old from China were investigated using a cross-sectional study. The participants were
classiﬁed as having metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) or metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO)
based on the presence/absence of metabolic abnormalities deﬁned by metabolic syndrome (MetS)
and body mass index (BMI). Serum-based metabolomic proﬁling using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) was undertaken on 67 MHO and 60 MUO individuals. ROC analyses showed
that palmitic acid, stearic acid, and phosphate could predict MUO, and that glycolic acid, alanine,
3-hydroxypropionic acid, and 2-hydroxypentanoic acid could predict MHO (allp < 0.05) from selected
samples. Five metabolites predicted MUO, 12 metabolites predicted MHO in boys, and only two
metabolites predicted MUO in girls. Moreover, several metabolic pathways may be relevant in
distinguishing the MHO and MUO groups, including the fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation
in mitochondria, propanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and fatty acid
metabolism pathways. Similar results were observed for boys except for phenylalanine, tyrosine and
tryptophan biosynthesis, which had a high impact [0.098]. The identiﬁed metabolites and pathways
could be efﬁcacious for investigating the underlying mechanisms of the development of different
metabolic phenotypes in obese Chinese adolescents.

obesity (MUO); children and adolescents
1. Introduction
Metabolic disorders, especially obesity in children and adolescents, have increased in
frequency and have become a major public health issue throughout the world [1]. Similarly,
the standardized prevalence of obesity in Chinese children and adolescents has increased
rapidly, from 1.7% in 1991–1995 to 9.6% in 2015–2019 [2].
Studies have shown that obesity can lead to metabolic abnormalities in the body, such
as elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [ 3].
Recent studies have found that obese individuals do not all have the same risk of developing
metabolic derangements, and individuals in the same body mass index (BMI) category can
also have different metabolic proﬁles. Some obese individuals, with so-called “metabolically
healthy obesity (MHO)”, showed a more beneﬁcial metabolic phenotype than metabolically
unhealthy obese (MUO) individuals [ 4]. Keihani et al. found that individuals with the
MUO phenotype showed higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes,
and all-cause mortality than those with the MHO phenotype [ 5]. Therefore, the timely

classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of obese individuals with different metabolic phenotypes
and the early development of cost-effective individualized prevention and intervention
programs are of great signiﬁcance for reducing the risk of metabolic abnormalities in obese
children and adolescents.
Currently, studies of the relevant factors and regulatory pathways for distinguishing
the MHO and MUO phenotypes are still limited, and their relationships are unclear. Several
studies have shown that diets, lifestyles, fat mass distributions, and other behavioral and
environmental factors are associated with MHO status. For instance, in our previous study,
lower arm fat mass amounts were found in the MHO group than in the MUO group among
children and adolescents [6]. However, obesity and its related metabolic abnormalities
result from a complex interaction between predisposing genetic and environmental factors.
Therefore, these factors may not reveal the causes of the differences between the MHO and
MUO phenotypes.
It is worth noting that metabolites, as intermediates or ﬁnal products of different
metabolic pathways, can reﬂect genetic and environmental exposures and their interactions.
Metabolomics measures low-molecular-weight metabolites from biological samples and
reveals the dynamic physiological changes that result from behavioral and clinical outcomes.
Thus, metabolomics technologies are a more creative and comprehensive screening tool for
exploring metabolites. A study of adults revealed key metabolomics proﬁles and pathways,
such as fatty acid biosynthesis, that could distinguish the MHO and MUO phenotypes by
using serum-based metabolomics technology [7].
Previous studies have applied metabolomics to investigate the metabolomic proﬁles
and relevant metabolic pathways of obese children and adolescents [8,9]. However, few
studies have used metabolomics to characterize the metabolic state of obese children and
adolescents. Therefore, we aimed to identify metabolites to distinguish metabolically
healthy from unhealthy obese Chinese children and adolescents in our study.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Population
In this cross-sectional study, population-based sampling was used to select children
and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years residing in Yinchuan, China, from October 2015 to
November 2018. Six schools were randomly selected for different age subgroups. More than
100 children were sampled by a stratiﬁed cluster random sampling method per age group
(each with half boys and half girls). Of those, 3149 subjects were selected, and 1673 subjects
were excluded because they did not meet all the inclusion criteria or due to missing data.
The remaining 1716 subjects were enrolled in the study and were classiﬁed according to
their BMIs into two main groups: the MHO group (n = 67) and the MUO group (n = 60)
(Figure 1). All participants completed a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements,
blood sample collection, and clinical examination. We calculated the statistical power using
G*Power software version 3.1.9.2 (G*Power Software Inc., Kiel, Germanyaccessed on) in
a post hoc manner, as follows: power(1 − β) = 0.80, ( α = 0.05, effect size = 0.5, n1 = 67,
n2 = 60). The exclusion criteria included subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
renal, thyroid or heart diseases. The study was conducted according to the standards of
the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningxia Medical
University (2021-G053). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant
guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was provided by all participants and their
parents/guardians.

2.2. Anthropometric and Biochemical Analysis 
Anthropometric and biochemical data were collected by trained staff using a stand-
ardized procedure. Weight, height and waist circumference (WC) were all measured ac-
curately twice to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm while the subjects were barefoot and wear-
ing lightweight clothing. The mean values were used to calculate BMIs (calculated as 
weight per height2 (kg·m−2)). 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were measured by automatic 
electronic sphygmomanometers (OMRON HEM -7012; Omron, Kyoto, Japan). These 
blood pressure measurements were obtained three times for all individuals at 1 –2 min 
intervals, and an appropriate cuff was selected according to the midpoint of the right cir-
cumference. The mean values of the last two measurements were recorded as the BP val-
ues. 
Venous blood samples were collected from all subjects by direct venipuncture after a 
12-h overnight fast. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), triglyceride 
(TG), low -density lipoprotein (LCL -C) and fasting plasma glucose (glucose oxidase 
method) levels were directly measured with a 7060C automatic chemistry analyzer (Hita-
chi, Tokyo, Japan) and were tested by enzymatic methods. 
2.3. Definitions 
According to the Working Group on Obesity (WGOC) in China, obese children and 
adolescents were defined by BMI values [10]. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) components 
were used to define metabolic abnormalities [11] as follows: (1) WC ≥ 90th percentile for 
age and sex [12]; (2) SBP and/or DBP ≥ 90th percentile for age, sex and height [13]; (3) TG 
levels ≥ 1.24 mmol·L−1; (4) low serum HDL-C ≤ 1.03 mmol·L−1; and (5) fasting glucose ≥ 5.6 
mmol·L−1. Thus, the criterion for MHO were defined as obese with 0–1 abnormalities, and 
for MUO it was defined as obese with ≥2 abnormalities. 
2.4. Metabolome Profile 
Plasma samples were collected and stored at −80 °C. The samples were thawed for 30 
min at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of a sample was taken and placed in a 1.5 mL EP tube. Next, 
5 μL of adonitol ( Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was added after adding 200 μL of

Anthropometric and biochemical data were collected by trained staff using a stan-
dardized procedure. Weight, height and waist circumference (WC) were all measured
accurately twice to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm while the subjects were barefoot and
wearing lightweight clothing. The mean values were used to calculate BMIs (calculated as

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were measured by automatic

pressure measurements were obtained three times for all individuals at 1–2 min intervals,
and an appropriate cuff was selected according to the midpoint of the right circumference.
The mean values of the last two measurements were recorded as the BP values.
Venous blood samples were collected from all subjects by direct venipuncture after a
12-h overnight fast. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), triglyceride
(TG), low-density lipoprotein (LCL-C) and fasting plasma glucose (glucose oxidase method)
levels were directly measured with a 7060C automatic chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan) and were tested by enzymatic methods.
2.3. Deﬁnitions
According to the Working Group on Obesity (WGOC) in China, obese children and
adolescents were deﬁned by BMI values [ 10]. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) components
were used to deﬁne metabolic abnormalities [ 11] as follows: (1) WC ≥ 90th percentile
for age and sex [ 12]; (2) SBP and/or DBP ≥ 90th percentile for age, sex and height [ 13];
(3) TG levels ≥ 1.24 mmol·L−1; (4) low serum HDL-C ≤ 1.03 mmol·L−1; and (5) fast-
ing glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol·L−1. Thus, the criterion for MHO were deﬁned as obese with
0–1 abnormalities, and for MUO it was deﬁned as obese with ≥2 abnormalities.
2.4. Metabolome Proﬁle
Plasma samples were collected and stored at −80 ◦C. The samples were thawed for
30 min at 4 ◦C. Fifty microliters of a sample was taken and placed in a 1.5 mL EP tube. Next,
5 µL of adonitol (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added after adding200 µL of the
methanol (CNW Technologies, Duesseldorf, Germany) extract. The mixture was vortexed
for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min in an ice water bath, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
Metabolites 2023, 13, 641 4 of 13
15 min at 4 ◦C. A total of 180 µL of supernatant was pipetted into a 1.5 mL EP tube, and
20 µL of each sample to be tested was taken and mixed as a QC (quality control) sample.
The metabolites were dried in a vacuum concentrator before being mixed with 80 µL of
methoxamine salt reagent (e.g., 20 mg/mL methoxamine hydrochloride (TCI, Tokyo, Japan)
dissolved in pyridine (Adamas, Shanghai, China)). The mixture was gently mixed and
incubated at 80 ◦C for 30 min. After that, 100 µL of BSTFA (containing 1% TMCS, v/v)
(REGIS Technologies, Morton Grove, IL, USA) was added to each sample, and the mixture
was incubated at 70 ◦C for 1.5 h. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and
5 µL of FAMEs (Dr Ehrenstorfer GmbH, Augsburg, Germany) (dissolved in chloroform
(Adamas, Shanghai, China)) was added. The machine was tested in a random order.
The metabolomics proﬁle analysis was performed by a gas chromatography mass
spectrometer (GC-MS) (GC-MS-QP2010, Shimadzu, Japan). Samples were analyzed by
applying the following instrument parameters. Chromatographic separations were per-
formed on an Agilent DB-5MS (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm) column. A volume of 1 µL of
derivatized sample solution was injected through a split/splitless injector operating at a
temperature of 280 ◦C, at a split ratio of 20:1, and with a helium carrier gas ﬂow rate of
1 mL·min−1 in constant ﬂow mode. Gas saver ﬂow (25 mL ·min−1) was switched on 15 s
after sample injection. The temperature program began at 70 ◦C with a hold time of 4 min,
followed by a linear temperature ramp of 8 ◦C per min up to 300 ◦C, followed by a hold
time of 10 min. The oven temperature was then allowed to cool to 70 ◦C before the next
injection. The transfer line temperature was held at 250 ◦C. The mass spectrometer source
was operated at a temperature of 200 ◦C in EI mode, with an electron energy of 70 eV . Data
were acquired over the range of 35-800 m/z and at an acquisition rate of 20 Hz.
2.5. Statistical Analyses
The original data were obtained from 127 experimental samples, from which2169 peaks
were extracted, and 2168 peaks were retained after preprocessing. All data were nor-
malized to an internal standard (e.g., heptadecanoic acid). Principal component analysis
(PCA), as an unsupervised analysis that reduces the dimensionality of the data, was car-
ried out to visualize the distribution and grouping of the samples. The 95% conﬁdence
interval in the PCA score plot was used as the threshold to identify potential outliers in
the dataset. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial
least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) established the supervised model to iden-
tify those variables with signiﬁcance, and it is also important to distinguish the MHO
from the MUO groups. Metabolite differences were tested by t-tests. The VIP > 1 and
p < 0.05 variables contributed greatly to the model, and the data were analyzed with
SIMCA Statistics software version 14.0 (Umetrics, Malmo, Sweden). Logistic regression
was used to track the optimal metabolic markers with p values of less than 0.05. To fur-
ther identify the metabolites, we performed ROC curve analyses. All relevant detected
metabolites were mapped to metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) database, and 80 human metabolism pathways were selected for
further analysis [ 14]. To clarify the metabolic pathways of differential metabolites, a
metabolic pathway analysis was performed with the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 tool (available
online at http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/ (accessed on 10 July 2020)). We
performed two different types of pathway analyses, including enrichment and topology
analyses. The sex and BMI variables were considered as potential confounding factors and
were controlled in the analysis.

3.2. Serum Metabolic Proﬁles of MHO and MUO
A principal component analysis showed that nearly all samples were within the 95%
conﬁdence interval. The OPLS-DA plots showed a clear separation of serum metabolites
between the MHO and MUO groups in the total subjects (Figure 2a). The serum metabolic
proﬁles of the MHO and MUO subjects among boys (Figure 2b) and girls (Figure 2c) had
similar results to all subjects.

subjects, six metabolites increased and 14 metabolites decreased in the MUO group com-
pared to the MHO group. Among girls, four metabolites decreased and two meta bolites 
increased. Out of 25 metabolites, 17 increased and eight decreased in the MUO group 
compared to the MHO group in boys. (Table 2)

3.4. Metabolite Pathways of Differential Metabolites
The metabolite pathways of different metabolites are shown in Table 3. Fatty acid
biosynthesis pathways were signiﬁcantly enriched ( p < 0.05), and four pathways had
low p values (p < 0.1), including the fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, propanoate
metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism pathways.
Furthermore, two pathways, including glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and fatty
acid metabolism obtained from topology analysis, had high pathway impacts greater
than 0.001 (Table 3 and Figure 3a). Similar results were shown among boys, except for
phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, which had a high impact [0.098]
(Table 3 and Figure 3b).

3.5. Further Identiﬁcation of Metabolites
Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the MUO phenotype was associated
with nine metabolites in all participants, and included glycolic acid, palmitic acid, stearic
acid, phosphate, asparagine, alanine, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 2-hydroxypentanoic acid,
and isoleucine (all p < 0.05). In girls, the MUO phenotype was associated with two metabo-
lites: glycyl-proline and glucosamine. An MUO status was associated with 19 metabolites,
including 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, 2-hydroxypentanoic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid,
5-methyluridine, acetophenone, alanine, asparagine, beta-gentiobiose, cyanoalanine, furoyl-
glycine, galactinol, glycerol-alpha-phosphate, glycolic acid, isocitric acid minor, isoleucine,
palmitic acid, salicylaldehyde, shikimic acid, and stearic acid (Table 4). The AUCs for these
metabolites are presented in Tables S1 and S2. The AUCs for palmitic acid, stearic acid, and
phosphate for predicting MUO and glycolic acid, alanine, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and
2-hydroxypentanoic acid for predicting MHO were all greater than 0.6 (all p < 0.05) in the
total population. In boys, ﬁve metabolites could predict MUO, 12 metabolites could predict
MHO, and only two metabolites from girls could predict MUO.

4. Discussion
In this study, we evaluated metabolome proﬁling which differentiated the MHO and
MUO phenotypes, and several potential metabolic pathways, which modulated the dif-
ferent metabolic proﬁles of obesity among Chinese adolescents. A panel of metabolites,
including palmitic acid, stearic acid, and 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, among others, was chosen
to accurately differentiate between subjects with the MHO and MUO. The main metabolic
pathways associated with the MUO phenotypes included fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty
acid elongation in mitochondria, propanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthe-
sis (only in boys).
In this study, we found that stearic acid and palmitic acid might help to initially iden-
tify MUO phenotypes in Chinese adolescents independent of age, sex, and BMI. Palmitic
acid and stearic acid are the most abundant saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in the diet [15]. In a
similar vein, some studies have also shown that patients with type 2 diabetes or hyperlipi-
demia and mice fed high-fat diets exhibited high plasma SFA levels, including the two acids
mentioned above [16–18]. Furthermore, some studies have also shown that palmitic acid
and stearic acid are more toxic to pancreatic β-cells, resulting in altered pancreatic β-cell
function [18,19]. In addition, both can induce inﬂammation and endoplasmic reticulum
stress in in vitro studies and animal studies [20,21]. Thus, these two fatty acids helped us
to distinguish obese adolescents who were metabolically unhealthy.
This KEGG ID (C00249) refers to the metabolite palmitic acid, which was involved in
both fatty acid elongation in the mitochondria and fatty acid metabolism. The latter had
a higher topological analysis impact factor in this study. The pathways mentioned above
are related to mitochondrial function: ATP production from mitochondrial β-oxidation
depends largely on the catabolism of saturated fatty acids containing 16 carbons and, to
a lesser extent, those with 18 carbons such as palmitate and stearate [ 22]. The synthesis
of long-chain saturated fatty acids involves the malonyl-CoA-dependent elongation of
fatty acids. An animal study showed that when palmitate was perfused into rat hearts,
some of the perfused palmitates underwent a chain extension to form stearate [22]. Stearic
acid and palmitic acid also played key roles in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, which
was identiﬁed in our pathway analysis. They elaborated that the elongation of fatty acid
chains as described above is localized on the outer surface of the mitochondrial membrane.
Malonyl-CoA, the ultimate two-carbon donor for chain elongation, which is present on the
Metabolites 2023, 13, 641 10 of 13
outer mitochondrial membrane, is synthesized with mitochondrial β-oxidation-derived
acetyl-CoA, and provides malonyl-CoA for fatty acid chain lengthening, which can inhibit
the excessive oxidation of mitochondrial fatty acids. In addition, malonyl-CoA induces
adipogenesis and stimulates glucose oxidation in response to insulin-activated acetyl-CoA
carboxylase. Therefore, these pathway abnormalities may reﬂect abnormal mitochondrial
function in obese children and adolescents. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis proposed
by Welsh et al. that SFA is a signiﬁcant contributor to β-cell dysfunction [23].
Moreover, this KEGG ID (C05984) refers to the metabolite 2-hydroxybutanoate, which
was found to identify MHO phenotypes for Chinese adolescents varying in age, sex, and
BMI in our study. Another study showed that 2-hydroxybutyric acid participates in the
synthesis of substrate branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) [24]. This study suggested that
the BCAA and 2-hydroxybutyric concentrations during fasting predicted insulin resistance
(IR) in adolescents, which could prevent other diseases in adulthood. 2-hydroxybutyric acid
is associated with impaired β-cell function in the human body, and has been recognized
as an early indicator of IR and type 2 diabetes in recent years [ 25]. 2-hydroxybutyric
acid was also involved in the propanoate metabolism pathway in this study. Impaired
metabolism of the propionic acid pathway not only leads to propionic acidemia but can
also induce abnormal blood glucose [26]. When metabolic abnormalities caused by insulin
resistance or hyperglycemia occur in obese children and adolescents, more pyruvate and
acetyl-CoA are produced by more glucose through the glycolytic pathway, which leads
to oxidative stress. To overcome oxidative stress, hepatocytes produce glutathione via
cysteine anabolic metabolism, which produces the byproduct α-ketobutyrate, which is
then converted to 2-hydroxybutyric acid [25]. In addition, M.Schwab et al. found that the
intermediate of propionate metabolism, propionyl-CoA, has a toxic effect on mitochondrial
function by inhibiting pyruvate oxidation [ 27]. These ﬁndings suggest that metabolites
and related pathways potentially play a role in regulating the metabolic state of early-life
obesity through mitochondria.
This KEGG ID (C00160) refers to the metabolite glycolic acid, which was a differential
metabolite with p < 0.05 in different metabolic phenotypes and was involved in the glyoxy-
late and dicarboxylic acid metabolic pathways in this study. Glycolic acid is required for
oxalic acid production, which has been found to increase the production of reactive oxygen
species from mitochondria [28]. Furthermore, we found that isocitric acid, an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, could also identify the MHO phenotype in obese children
and adolescents, and it was found to be positively correlated with BMI, abdominal obesity,
HOMA-IR, and triglycerides (TG) by Jennifer E et al. [29]. These studies combined suggest
that the different metabolic phenotypes of obese children and adolescents are related not
only to mitochondrial dysfunction but also to energy metabolic homeostasis.
In our pathway analysis of boys, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosyn-
thesis (C00493) scored highest for their effects (0.098). An animal study showed that
apolipoprotein-I (a major component of high-density lipoprotein) knockout mice exhib-
ited abnormalities in the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolic
pathways [30]. Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase.
This conversion stimulated the synthesis of catecholamines in the brain, which resulted
in a decrease in blood pressure [ 31]. Shikimic acid has been identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant
metabolite for distinguishing MHO (Table S2), and was involved in the pathways men-
tioned above. Shikimic acid is a phenolic compound and an intermediate metabolite in
tryptophan synthesis. A small proportion of tryptophan is catalyzed by tryptophan hydrox-
ylase to form 5-hydroxytryptamine, a vasoconstrictor in peripheral tissues. Patients with
coronary artery disease have reduced plasma tryptophan concentrations and increased
kynurenine/tryptophan levels due to the conversion of the majority of tryptophan to
kynurenine [31]. Therefore, the metabolites and pathways may be associated with lipid and
blood pressure abnormalities, which are important for the identiﬁcation and development
of different metabolic phenotypes in obese children and adolescents. Consequently, these
ﬁndings suggest that 2-hydroxybutyric acid, glycolic acid, shikimic acid, alanine, and other
Metabolites 2023, 13, 641 11 of 13
metabolites associated with the MHO phenotype indicate that the MHO phenotype has an
early-stage cardiovascular disease risk proﬁle.
Notably, our study found that only glycyl-proline and glucosamine were associated
with the MUO phenotype in girls, and no relevant metabolic pathways were identiﬁed,
which suggested that there were sex differences in the metabolites and pathways in iden-
tifying the MUO and MHO phenotypes. Several studies based on metabolic disorders
and cardiovascular disease have also found that females typically have more beneﬁcial
metabolic proﬁles and lower risks of cardiovascular disease [ 32,33]. Similarly, a cohort
study showed that transitional MHO females had healthier metabolic proﬁles than their
male counterparts. This could explain the sex differences. In addition, the relationship of
glycyl-proline and glucosamine with the MUO phenotype has not been studied. Proline is a
protective substance for membranes and enzymes in living organisms, and is a free radical
scavenger that protects the vascular endothelium from damage [ 34]. Its plasma levels
are often altered by endovascular lesions, but the role of glycyl-proline in cardiovascular
metabolism is not yet clear.
To the best of our knowledge, few studies have previously assessed untargeted
metabolomics in Chinese children and adolescents with different metabolic phenotypes.
However, several limitations of our study should be noted here. First, in a cross-sectional
study, we failed to demonstrate the causal association between the identiﬁed metabolic
pathways or metabolites and different metabolic phenotypes in obese children and adoles-
cents, and more prospective studies are needed for validation. Second, some interpretations
may be inaccurate, although previous studies of animals or adults can explain the biological
rationality of metabolites found due to the species, age differences, and limited research
related to children and adolescents in metabolites. Third, it is noteworthy that the sample
size is relatively small. Fourth, in untargeted analyses, it is possible that one peak may
correspond to multiple metabolites with similar mass over charge values, leading to po-
tentially less accurate results in pathway analysis. Some metabolites may not be identiﬁed
in humans and need to be examined manually, even in pathway analysis and with the
KEGG dataset. Fifth, we did not adjust for puberty-related variables due to a lack of diet
and physical activity data in our study, which may have affected the results of the study.
Finally, the deﬁnition of MHO may lead to results that are inconsistent with other studies,
and different metabolic abnormalities may have different underlying causes.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully identiﬁed several related metabolites that distin-
guish the MUO group from the MHO group, including palmitic acid, stearic acid, glycolic
acid, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, shikimic acid, and others. These metabolites are involved in
several important metabolic pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elonga-
tion in mitochondria, propanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism,
fatty acid metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (only in
boys). Future studies are needed to validate our ﬁndings; that is, abnormal mitochondrial
function may be associated with different metabolic states in obese children and adoles-
cents, and more studies are needed to investigate the potential mechanisms of metabolic
dysregulation in obesity.
