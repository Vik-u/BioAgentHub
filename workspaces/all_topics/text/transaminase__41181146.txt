Object: Liver ﬁbrosis is a key stage in chronic liver disease, but targeted
treatments are scarce. Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a traditional Chinese medicine,
shows anti-ﬁbrotic potential, though its mechanisms are not fully understood.
Method: Al i v e rﬁbrosis model was created in C57BL/6 mice using carbon
tetrachloride (CCL4). PZH’s effects were assessed via liver morphology, serum/
liver biomarkers, transaminase levels, and histopathology. PZH ’sc h e m i c a l
components were identiﬁed through database and literature research. Network
pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were
used to investigate the underlying mechanisms, which were validatedin vivo
and in vitro with immunoﬂuorescence and Western blot analyses.
Results: PZH signiﬁcantly attenuated hepatic transaminase disorders, reduced
serum procollagen III/IV, alleviatedﬁbrotic liver histopathology, and suppressed
macrophage markers and hepatic in ﬂammation. Through multi-database
integration, 24 bioactive compounds were identi ﬁed in PZH, including
ginsenoside Rh2. Further investigat ion showed that PZH ameliorates liver
ﬁbrosis by modulating key targets, including AKT1, EGFR, and STAT3. Molecular
docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated a signiﬁcantly
high binding afﬁnity between ginsenoside Rh2 and the target proteins EGFR,
JAK1, and STAT3. In vitro and in vivo experiments conﬁrmed that PZH and
ginsenoside Rh2, reduced RAW264.7 in ﬂammatory mediators, inhibited M1
polarization, and downregulated EGFR/JAK1/STAT3.
Conclusion: The ﬁndings reveal that PZH ameliorates liverﬁbrosis by inhibiting
macrophage-mediated inﬂammation via blockade of the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3
signaling axis, providing a mechanistic foundation for its clinical application.

1 Introduction
Hepatic ﬁbrosis is a dysregulation condition due to various
chronic liver diseases ’damage and repair response. According to a
study by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), approximately 2
billion people worldwide are affected by chronic liver disease, with
25%-30% progressing to liver ﬁbrosis. By 2020, over 12 million new
cases were reported, accounting for about 1.4 million deaths.
According to epidemiological reports ( 1, 2), the prevalence of
liver ﬁbrosis ranges from 7% to 12% in China. This is primarily
driven by hepatitis B virus infection (45% of cases) and non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (30% of cases). Without
effective intervention, liver ﬁbrosis patients in China are projected
to exceed 50 million by 2030, with approximately 15% progressing
to decompensated cirrhosis ( 3). Liver ﬁbrosis is a major global
health challenge, making it essential to understand its
pathophysiology and develop effective treatments.
Current treatments for liver ﬁbrosis, such as antivirals for viral
hepatitis, alcohol abstinence, and metabolic control for NAFLD, can
partially reverse early ﬁbrosis, but are ineffective for advanced
scarring ( 4). Approved anti ﬁbrotics like pirfenidone and
nintedanib inhibit hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and
suppress transforming growth factor- b (TGF- b) signaling
pathway ( 5, 6), but have limited ef ﬁcacy due to toxicity, side
effects, and single-target limitations. There is an urgent need for
more effective liver ﬁbrosis treatments.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recognized for its multi-
target and multi-pathway therapeutic effects. Emerging evidence
underscores the signi ﬁcant role of TCM in the prevention and
treatment of liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and
viral hepatitis ( 7, 8). Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a renowned TCM
formulation that has been utilized for over 500 years since its
development during the Ming Dynasty (1368 –1644 CE) as a remedy
for in ﬂammatory and infectious diseases ( 9). Derived from classical
formulas like Huanglian Jiedu Tang, PZH contains natural ingredients
such as natural Calculus bovis,m u s k ,Pseudoginsengroot, and Snake
gallbladder. Essentially, PZH exerts “heat-clearing, detoxifying, and
blood-activating” effects, which align with its clinical applications in
liver ﬁbrosis and cancer-associated inﬂammation. While there, PZH is
effective in improving liver function and reducing ﬁbrosis markers in
preclinical models (10, 11), its precise molecular mechanisms in anti-
ﬁbrotic and anti-tumor activities remain incompletely understood.
Network pharmacological analysis, ﬁrst proposed by Hopkins
in 2007, is a promising research ﬁeld and an advanced approach to
elucidate bioactive substances and the pharmacological
mechanisms of Chinese her bal medicines through the
construction of drug-target-disease interaction networks. Notably,
previous research has shown that network pharmacology is effective
in elucidating the pharmacodynamic basis and mechanisms of
Chinese herbal medicines, including PZH in the treatment and
management of colon cancer and Calculus bovisin the treatment of
liver cancer ( 12, 13). Notably, this system-driven paradigm has been
pivotal in elucidating the anti-in ﬂammatory and anti- ﬁbrotic
actions of PZH.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor
tyrosine kinase present on hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and
macrophages. It forms a complex with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) to
phosphorylate STAT3 and promote STAT3 entry into the nucleus,
which then regulates ﬁbrogenesis-related genes ( 14, 15). While the
EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway is associated with ﬁbrosis in various
organs, its role in liver ﬁbrosis remains unclear.
In this study, we initially evaluated the therapeutic effects of
PZH on liver ﬁbrosis through the assessment of biochemical
indices, histopathological analysis, and pro-in ﬂammatory
macrophage transformation in a carbon tetrachloride (CCL 4)-
induced liver ﬁbrosis mouse model. Additionally, we used
bioinformatics approaches to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the therapeutic effects of PZH. Finally, we assessed the
predictive pathways (the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway) through
immunoblotting of in vivo liver tissues and in vitro assays using
immunohistochemistry and ELISA techniques. This study aims to
provide suf ﬁcient evidence for the clinical application of the
PZH approach.

2.3 Animal experiment
A total of 40 male C57BL/6 mice (6 –8 weeks old, weighing 18 –
22 g) were purchased from Beijing Huafukang Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd (Beijing, China). The animals were housed under controlled
environmental conditions of temperature 23 ± 2 °C and relative
humidity of 50 ± 10%, with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals
were normally fed and watered. All animal experiments were
conducted in strict adherence to the Guidelines for Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (Ethics No.: FJTCM-IACUC-2022019) and ARRIVE 2.0
reporting standards. Additionally, all animals were ethically treated
to minimize their suffering.
After one week of adaptive feeding, the mice were randomly
assigned into ﬁve groups: vehicle control group (VC), model control
group (MC), PZH-L group (0.117 g/kg/day), PZH-M group (0.234
g/kg/day), and PZH-H group (0.468 g/kg/day). Liver ﬁbrosis was
induced through intraperitoneal injection of 5 mL/kg body weight
of CCL4/peanut oil (1:9, v/v). All mice were injected with the CCL 4/
peanut oil solution twice a week for 6 weeks, except for the VC
group, which received the same volume of saline solution for 6
weeks. The administration groups received intragastric
administration of PZH or saline (10 mL/kg/day) for 6 weeks
beginning at one day after CCL 4 injections. The dose of PZH
used in this experiment was selected according to Dose
translation from animal to human ( 16). Additionally, all PZH
suspensions were prepared in 0.9% NaCl to achieve target
concentrations: 0.048 g/mL (high), 0.024 g/mL (medium), and
0.0117 g/mL (low). The body weights of the mice were monitored
daily to adjust the dosing volumes, and the mice were maintained
on a high-fat diet throughout the study.
At the end of the experiment, all mice were fasted overnight
before blood collection from the ocular venous plexus. The blood
samples were double centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min to obtain
serum for subsequent biochemical analysis. After blood collection,
the abdominal cavity was opened to excise the liver. After
photographic imaging, a 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm tissue block was
dissected from the largest hepatic lobe. Residual blood and
surface debris were eliminated through washing with ice-cold
0.9% saline. Subsequently, the tissue sections were blotted dry
with sterile ﬁlter paper. For histopathological evaluation,
the samples were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for
48 h, followed by paraf ﬁn embedding to conduct hematoxylin-eosin
(H&E), Masson ’s trichrome staining, and immunohistochemical
(IHC) analysis. The remaining liver tissues were ﬂash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, wrapped in aluminum foil, and stored at -80 °C for
protein extraction and immunoblotting assays.
2.4 Histological staining
The liver tissues were harvested, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraf ﬁn, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 mm.
Notably, histological analysis was performed through H&E
staining, while Masson ’s trichrome staining was used to assess the
ﬁbrotic area. Five random ﬁelds of Masson-stained sections from
each sample were captured using a light microscope.
2.5 Measurement of serum liver function
markers
Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) were quanti ﬁed using a microplate-based
colorimetric assay based on the kit instructions from the
manufacturer. Brie ﬂy, 10 mL of serum was mixed with 100 mLo f
active reagent, and absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a
microplate reader after incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The ELISA
technique was used to assess the concentrations of type III
procollagen (PCIII) and type IV collagen (CIV) in serum. Serum
samples (50 mL) were seeded into the pre-coated 96-well plates,
followed by incubation with detection antibodies and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. Consequently, a stop
solution was used to terminate the reaction, and absorbance was
measured at 450 nm. Notably, following the instructions on the kit,
a standard curve was generated, and the protein concentrations of
the samples were then determined accordingly.
2.6 Immunohistochemistry and
immunoﬂuorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immuno ﬂuorescence were
performed to detect the protein expression of CD68 in liver
tissues in all groups. Liver tissue sections were deparaf ﬁnized,
hydrated, and incubated with 3% H 2O2 for 5~10 min. They were
then blocked with buffer and incubated with primary antibody
CD68 at 4 °C overnight. This was followed by incubation with
the secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C, and then with SABC at
37 °C for 10 min. The 3,3 ′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB) solution was added to examine the immunoreactivity. The
nucleus was stained with hematoxylin, and sections were sealed
with neutral gum. Finally, images were captured using an optical
microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; model
ECLIPSE 511).
2.7 Bioinformatics analysis
2.7.1 Prediction of prospective PZH targets
associated with liverﬁbrosis
The bioactive compounds of PZH, including Panax
notoginseng, Calculus bovis, Snake gallbladder, and Moschus, were
systematically retrieved from the TCMSP (Traditional Chinese
Medicine Systems Pharmacology, https://www.tcmsp-e.com/ )
(17), TCMID (Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database)
(18), PubMed ( 19), and CNKI (China National Knowledge
Infrastructure) databases. Potential active ingredients were
selected as compounds attaining the oral bioavailability (OB)
≥30% and drug-likeness (DL) ≥0.18. Canonical simpli ﬁed
Hong et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1665648
Frontiers inImmunology frontiersin.org03
molecular input line entry system(SMILES) of these components
were downloaded from the PubChem database ( https://
pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) and uploaded to the Swiss Target
Prediction platform ( http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch )t o
predict protein targets (probability score ≥0.3) ( 17). Additionally,
the target gene names were standardized using the UniProt
database ( https://www.uniprot.org, release 2024-05). Construction
of the drug-component-target network was conducted and then
visualized using Cytoscape 3.7.2 ( https://cytoscape.org) to elucidate
interactions among PZH constituents, bioactive components, and
potential targets.
Liver ﬁbrosis-related targets were retrieved from the Genecards
(version 5.22.0, https://www.genecards.org )( 20) and Online
mendelian inheritance in man(OMIM) ( https://www.omim.org)
(21) databases using the keywords “liver ﬁbrosis” and “hepatic
ﬁbrosis.”All duplicate entries were eliminated, resulting in a non-
redundant list of disease-associ ated targets. The herbs-active
components-targets network was constructed and visualized via
the Cytoscape 3.7.1 software after the names were standardized
using the Uniprot database ( https://www.uniprot.org , release
2024-05).
2.7.2 Coincident targets identiﬁcation and
protein-protein interaction network analysis
Cross-sectional analysis w as conducted to identify the
overlapping targets between bioactive components of PZH and
ﬁbrosis-related targets using the Venny 2.1.0 software ( https://
bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html ). These common
targets were considered as potential therapeutic targets for PZH
in treating liver ﬁbrosis. The search tool for the retrieval of
interacting genes(STRING) database ( https://string-db.org ,
version 12.0) ( 22) was used to construct protein –protein
interaction (PPI) networks with a medium con ﬁdence score
threshold and species restriction to Homo sapiens. The resulting
data was then imported into Cytoscape 3.7.2 for
network visualization.
2.7.3 Gene ontology function and Kyoto
encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment
analysis
The BioMart ( https://www.ensembl. org/biomart/martview )
software was used to convert the common targets to Gene Stable
IDs. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (biological
processes, molecular functions , and cellular components) and
KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the OmicShare
platform ( https://www.omicshare.com ). Signi ﬁcantly enriched
terms ( P < 0.05) were visualized as bar plots and bubble charts to
highlight key pathways and biological functions associated with the
anti-ﬁbrotic effects of PZH.
2.7.4 Molecular docking for ginsenoside Rh2
Molecular docking simulations were conducted to elucidate the
binding modes and af ﬁnities of ginsenoside Rh2 with the core target
proteins identi ﬁed in this study. In speci ﬁc operations, we ﬁrst
prepared the receptor proteins: EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 were
selected as target proteins, and high-resolution crystal structures of
Homo sapiens origin were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) (EGFR (PDB ID: 1M14), JAK1 (PDB ID: 6SM8), and STAT3
(PDB ID: 6NJS)). After docking, we systematically analyzed the
binding energy scores and interaction patterns to identify the
optimal conformation. Prior to docking, the protein structures
underwent preprocessing in PyMOL ( 23 )t or e m o v e
crystallographic water molecules and any co-crystallized ligands.
Subsequently, the prepared proteins were imported into AutoDock
Tools 1.5.7 for protonation at pH 7.4, assignment of atomic charges
(24), and merging of non-polar hydrogen atoms. Subsequently, the
grid dimensions for docking of compound ginsenoside Rh2 with
STAT3, JAK1, and EGFR were set as 71.25 × 108.75 × 102.75 Å,
112.5 × 97.5 × 63.75 Å, and 102.0 × 75.0 × 47.25 Å, respectively —
covering the central region of the protein active site. Parameter
settings included output of the top 20 conformations (n_modes =
20), an energy cutoff threshold of 4 kcal/mol, and an exhaustiveness
value of 10. Blind docking calculations were performed using Vina
to comprehensively scan the protein surface. After docking, we
systematically analyzed the binding energy scores and interaction
patterns to identify the optimal conformation.
2.7.5 Molecular dynamics simulation
Based on the molecular docking results, classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS
(version 2023.5)( https://www.gromacs.org/)( 25) to validate the
binding interactions between ginsenoside Rh2 and EGFR, JAK1,
and STAT3. The topology of each protein was generated using the
pdb2gmx module with the CHARMM36 ( 26) force ﬁeld. Each
protein was solvated in a dodecahedral box with a TIP3P water
(27)model, maintaining a minimum distance of 1.0 nm between the
protein and the box boundaries in all directions. Sodium (Na +) and
chloride (Cl −) ions were added to neutralize the system and mimic
physiological ionic conditions. Energy minimization was conducted
using the steepest descent algorithm with a Verlet cut-off scheme for
up to 50,000 steps to achieve a stable energy-minimized
conﬁguration. The system was subsequently equilibrated under
canonical (NVT) and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles for
100 ps each. Temperature was maintained at 300 K using the V-
rescale thermostat, an improv ed variant of the Berendsen
thermostat, with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps ( 28). Pressure was
regulated at 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat, employing
a coupling constant of 2.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5 × 10 −5
bar−1 (29). Alternatively, the C-rescale pressure coupling algorithm
was also applied under the same conditions to maintain constant
pressure ( 30). Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated
using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method, while short-range
Coulomb and van der Waals interactions were computed with a
cut-off of 1.2 nm. Bond constraints were applied using the LINCS
algorithm ( 31). Production MD simulations were carried out for
100 ns per complex. Trajectory analysis was performed using built-
in GROMACS utilities. For all root mean square deviation (RMSD)
analyses, the protein backbone atoms including C, C a, N of each
simulated complex were ﬁrst least-squares ﬁtted to the backbone
atoms of the initial energy-minimized structure to remove global
Hong et al. 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1665648
Frontiers inImmunology frontiersin.org04
translational and rotational effects. The RMSD was then calculated
for the same set of ﬁtted backbone atoms to quantify the
conformational stability of the protein throughout the simulation
trajectory. In addition, the ligand RMSD for ginsenoside Rh2 was
computed after ﬁtting the trajectory onto the protein backbone to
assess the stability of the ligand within the binding pocket. Key
structural and dynamic properties were evaluated, including the
root mean square deviation (RMSD) ( 32), root mean square
ﬂuctuation (RMSF) ( 33), radius of gyration (Rg) ( 34), solvent-
accessible surface area (SASA) ( 35), and intermolecular hydrogen
bonds between the ligand and protein. To quantitatively assess
binding energetics, the gmx MMPBSA tool was employed. This
method estimates the binding free energy by combining molecular
mechanics (MM) energy terms including van der Waals and
electrostatic contributions wi th implicit solvation effects,
decomposed into polar and non-polar components. The polar
solvation energy was calculated using the Poisson –Boltzmann
equation, while the non-polar contribution was estimated based
on the SASA. The overall gas-phase MM energy, total solvation
energy, and restraint energy were also computed. The MMPBSA
analysis was performed over 2000 frames extracted from the last
20 ns of each stable trajectory ( 36), using an integrated PBSA solver.
Results were interpreted and visualized using the MMPBSA_ana
module. All MD and MMPBSA calculations were executed via
automated work ﬂows implemented on the ScientiFlow platform
(https://scienti ﬂow.com/ ), ensuring reproducibility and
computational ef ﬁciency.
2.8 Cell culture and treatment
RAW264.7 cells (ATCC® TIB-71™) were obtained from Wuhan
Punosai Life Sciences Co Ltd. (Wuhan, China) and authenticated via
short tandem repeat (STR) pro ﬁling. The cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’sM o d iﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), and then incubated in a 5% CO 2 humidiﬁed atmosphere
at 37°C. After inoculated in 96-well or 6-well culture plates, cells were
divide into groups as: vehicle control (VC, 1‰ DMSO solution), model
(LPS), PZH high-dose (100 mg/mL), PZH medium-dose (75 mg/mL),
PZH low-dose (50 mg/mL), ginsenoside Rh2 high-dose (6 mg/mL),
ginsenoside Rh2 medium-dose (4 mg/mL), and ginsenoside Rh2 low-
dose (2 mg/mL). 2 h after pre-administr ation in the administration
group, both the model group and the administration group were
treated with 1 mg/mL LPS for 24 h.
2.9 Immunoﬂuorescence staining for IRF5
expression in M1 macrophages
Cells were cultured in the 24-well plate at 1 × 10 4 cells/well for
24 h. After 2 h of pre-administration in the treatment groups, the
model group and treatment groups were incubated for 1 mg/mL LPS
for 24 h. They were then ﬁxed, blocked, and incubated with the
IRF5 antibody at 4°C overnight, and then treated with a ﬂuorescent
secondary antibody for 1 h at 37°C. The cell nuclei were stained
with DAPI for 5~10 min. Finally, the images were captured using a
ﬂuorescent inverted microscope.
2.10 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
for TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b
Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 1 × 10 4 cells/well. After
2 h of pre-administration in the treatment groups, the model group
and treatment groups were incubated for 1 mg/mL LPS for 24 h.
supernatants were collected through centrifugation at 1500 g for 5
min. The concentrations of TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-1 b were measured
using ELISA kits following the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Additionally, TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-1 b were also determined in
vivo. Blood samples were collected from the mice and then
centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to obtain serum. The levels of
TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1 b in the serum were measured using ELISA
kits strictly in accordance with the manufacturer ’s instructions.
2.11 Griess assay for nitric oxide
quantiﬁcation in RAW 264.7 cell
supernatants
Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 1 × 10 4 cells/well. After 2 h
of pre-administration in the treatment groups, the model group and
treatment groups were incubated for 1 mg/mL LPS for 24 h. Next,
50 mL of culture supernatant was transferred to 96-well plates. Equal
volumes (50 mL) of Griess reagent A and Griess reagent B were
sequentially added to each well, followed by further incubation at
room temperature in the dark for 10 min to allow chromogenic
reaction. The absorbance of the cell supernatant was measured at
540 nm using a microplate reader. Nitrite concentration was
calculated using a standard curve generated with sodium nitrite
solutions (0~100 mM).
2.12 Western blot analysis
Total and nuclear proteins from cells and liver tissues were
prepared using standard proced ures. The concentration of
extracted protein was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
method. Equal amounts of protein from each group were separated
by 10~12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked
with 5% skim milk and incubated with speci ﬁc primary antibodies
targeting the EGFR, JAK1, STAT3, p-JAK1, p-STAT3, CD68, IRF5,
IL-12A, and GAPDH proteins overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was
washed with TBST and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,
the membranes were incubated with chromogenic reagents A and B
and shaken gently at room temperature for 1 min. PVDF membranes
were developed using a chemiluminescence gel imaging system and
analyzed using Image Lab software.

2.13 Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 26.0
software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Normality tests were
conducted on all the data, with normally distributed data presented
as mean ± standard deviation (x¯ ± s). Differences among the
groups were assessed using the one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Prior to ANOVA, the homogeneity of variances was
evaluated using Levene ’s test. For data with homogeneous variance
(Levene’s test,P>0.05), the least signi ﬁcant difference (LSD) post-hoc
test was conducted. For data that violated the assumption of
homogeneity of variance (Levene ’st e s t , P≤ 0.05), the Games-
Howell post-hoc test was applied. Non-normally distributed data
were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test, which is a non-
parametric multiple-sample rank sum test. Statistical signi ﬁcance
was set at p<0.05. GraphPad Prism (9.5) was used for
data visualization.
3 Results
3.1 PZH attenuated body weight and liver
ﬁbrosis markers
All the experimental procedures are shown in Figure 1A . The
VC mice exhibited a steady gain in body weight ( Figure 1B ). In
contrast, all groups receiving CCL 4 injections showed progressive
weight loss following the initial administration, indicating systemic
toxicity associated with hepatic ﬁbrosis induction. Notably, there
were no signi ﬁcant changes in the weight loss following treatment
with PZH compared to the model group. After 6 weeks of CCL 4
administration, serum levels of AST, ALT, procollagen type III (PC-
III), and collagen type IV (C-IV) in the MC mice were signi ﬁcantly
increased compared to the VC group ( P < 0.01). Conversely, PZH
treatment signi ﬁcantly reduced the levels of serum AST, ALT, PC-
III, and C-IV in a dose-dependent manner compared to the MC
group ( P < 0.01) ( Figures 1C –F). This signi ﬁcant attenuation of
both hepatocellular injury mar kers and extracellular matrix
components demonstrates the multifaceted anti- ﬁbrotic ef ﬁcacy
of PZH.
3.2 PZH improved hepatic histopathology
and attenuated collagen deposition in
ﬁbrotic mice
Gross and histological examinations demonstrated that PZH
has protective effects against CCL 4-induced hepatic damage.
Macroscopically, the livers of the VC group were healthy and
reddish with smooth surfaces, whereas the liver of the MC group
displayed characteristic ﬁbrotic changes, including yellowish-brown
discoloration, rough granular surfaces, and a hardened texture.
Notably, treatment with PZH in a dose-dependent manner
improved liver morphology, with high- and medium-dose groups
showing near-normal coloration and smooth surfaces ( Figure 1G ).
These ﬁndings were validated through histological evaluation using
H&E staining: the normal hepatic lobular architecture with radially
arranged hepatocyte cords was preserved in the VC group, while the
MC group exhibited severe hepatocyte ballooning, in ﬂammatory
inﬁltration, and ﬁbrotic septa formation. These pathological
changes were signi ﬁcantly ameliorated through PZH
administration, with high- an d medium-dose groups showing
signi ﬁcantly reduced cellular edema and in ﬂammatory cell
inﬁltration ( Figure 1H ). These observations were validated
through Masson ’s trichrome staining, demonstrating extensive
collagen deposition (blue staining) and architectural distortion in
the MC mice livers compared to minimal staining in the VC group.
Notably, PZH treatment dose-dependently reduced collagen
accumulation, with high- and medium-dose groups exhibiting
near-normal collagen levels, with preserved lobular morphology
(Figure 1I ). Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that treatment
with PZH improves liver function and attenuates in ﬂammatory
pathological lesions.
3.3 PZH modulated hepatic macrophage
polarization and suppressed pro-
inﬂammatory activation in liverﬁbrosis
To gain a deeper understanding of the in ﬂammatory
microenvironment associated with ﬁbrosis progression, we
conducted a quantitative analysis of key pro-in ﬂammatory
cytokines. The results obtained from the ELISA assay indicated
that the levels of TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-1 b were signiﬁcantly higher in
t h eM Cm i c er e l a t i v et ot h eV Cg r o u p( P < 0.01). Notably,
administration of PZH resulted in a marked, dose-dependent
reduction in the production of these cytokines ( P < 0.01), thereby
demonstrating a potent anti-in ﬂammatory effect ( Figure 2A ).
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed signi ﬁcant alterations in
the population of the macrophages during ﬁbrogenesis. Notably,
MC mice exhibited markedly increased CD68 macrophage
inﬁltration compared to the VC group ( P < 0.01), indicative of
enhanced monocyte recruitment during hepatic ﬁbrosis. The
expression of CD68 were signi ﬁcantly reduced in a dose-
dependent manner using PZH treatment ( P < 0.01), indicative of
inhibited macrophage hepatic in ﬁltration ( Figures 2B , C).
Furthermore, PZH signi ﬁcantly attenuated pro-in ﬂammatory
macrophage polarization, as evidenced by decreased expression of
IRF5 ( P < 0.01) and IL-12A ( P < 0.01) compared to the MC mice
(Figures 2D , E). The coordinated downregulation of pro-
inﬂammatory markers — CD68, IRF5, and IL-12A, indicates that
PZH suppressed M1-like state.
3.4 Network pharmacology predicts that
PZH may affect liverﬁbrosis in HSCs via
the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway
Through systematic screening of the TCMSP database and
literature mining, we identi ﬁed 31 bioactive compounds in PZH.

After the elimination of duplicate entries, a total of 24 unique
components were identi ﬁed. The pharmacologically active
constituents of the formulation were derived from its four
principal herbal components: Panax notoginseng(11 compounds),
Calculus bovis (10 compounds), Moschus (4 compounds), and
Serpentis Bill (6 compounds) ( Table 1). Key bioactive constituents
were prioritized based on network centrality parameters (degree
centrality and betweenness centrality), with quercetin, ursolic acid,
b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, b-elemene, lauric acid, ginsenoside Rh2,
testosterone, 17- b-estradiol, and ursodeoxycholic acid as the most
pharmacologically relevant components. Online databases were
used to identify the potential targets of liver ﬁbrosis and PZH. A

total of 217 target genes were identi ﬁed for PZH, while 7043 target
genes were identiﬁ ed for liver ﬁbrosis. Among these, there were 196
common targets, representing 90.32% of the overlap, indicated a
high correlation between PZH targets and liver ﬁbrosis targets,
suggesting that PZH has therapeutic potential for liver ﬁbrosis
(Figure 3A ). The processed PPI network was visualized using
Cytoscape 3.7.1 software ( Figures 3B , C), with strict adherence to
the selection criteria, thereby resulting in a total of 20 core targets,
including AKT1, IL6, TNF, TP53, VEGFA, JUN, IL1B, EGFR,
CASP3, PTGS2, MYC, ESR1, STAT3, HIF1A, MMP9, EGF,
PPARG, FOS, CXCL8, and CCND1, which are considered key
targets of contributing to the anti-hepatic ﬁbrosis activity of PZH.
To explore the molecular mechanisms of the anti-hepatic ﬁbrosis
effect of PZH, GO, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were

performed on the common targets between PZH and hepatic
ﬁbrosis. The GO enrichment anal ysis results established 6206
biological processes (BPs) rela ted to regulation of metabolic
processes, immune system processes, and response to exogenous
stimuli ( Figure 3D ). The core targets were linked to 908 molecular
functions (MFs), including antioxidant activity, and 537 cellular
components (CCs), such as those involved in cell proliferation.
KEGG pathway analysis revealed 175 signaling pathways associated
with PZH and liver ﬁbrosis were obtained, encompassing pathways
associated with cancer, glucose metabolism, hepatitis B, and
cytokine signaling pathways ( Figure 3E ). Of which, core targets
(EGFR, STAT3, JAK1) all are enriched in cancer signaling
pathways, given their high connectivity in the PPI network
(Figure 3C ) and established crosstalk in liver ﬁbrosis, we
hypothesized that PZH modulates the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3
signaling axis. Subsequently, we selected this pathway for further
analysis in both in vitroand in vivoexperiments.
3.5 Molecular docking results
A molecular docking analysis was performed to examine the
interactions between ginsenoside Rh2 and three core target genes:
EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3. Utilizing AutoDock software, docking

simulations were conducted, revealing low binding energies that
suggest strong af ﬁnities between the compound and the target
proteins. The docking fraction of the compound and the protein
is shown in Figure 4 depicts an image of the optimal docking of
receptor and ligand after visualization. The results showed that
ginsenoside Rh2 could interact with EGFR, JAK1 and STAT3.
(Figures 4A –F). Figures 4A , B shows that ginsenoside Rh2 forms
one hydrogen bond with ASP831, ARG817, LYS721, and THR766
in EGFR. Figures 4C , D shows that ginsenoside Rh2 forms one
hydrogen bond with LYS965 in JAK1. Figures 4E , F shows that
ginsenoside Rh2 can interact with HIS332, ARG335, ASN567 in
STAT3 through three hydrogen bond. Notably, all three core target
proteins demonstrated signi ﬁcant binding to ginsenoside Rh2, with
binding energies all below zero. Speci ﬁcally, the calculated binding
energies for ginsenoside Rh2 with EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 were
-8.042, -9.444, and -8.085 kcal/mol, respectively. These values
indicate spontaneous binding, underscoring the potential roles of
these interactions in the mol ecular mechanisms underlying
liver injury.
3.6 Molecular stability of docked
complexes
To evaluate the binding stability of ginsenoside Rh2 with EGFR,
JAK1, and STAT3, MD simulations were performed for 100 ns on
each complex. Structural stability was assessed using multiple
quantitative metrics, including RMSD, hydrogen bonding, RMSF,
Rg, and SASA. The RMSD of the protein backbone atoms was
calculated to monitor conformational stability over time. As
depicted in Figure 5A , each system reached equilibrium within
the ﬁnal 20 ns of the simulation. The RMSD values ﬂuctuated
within a minimal range of 0.2 nm, indicating that Rh2-EGFR, Rh2-
JAK1, and Rh2-STAT3, achieved structural equilibrium and
remained stable throughout th e simulation period. Hydrogen
bonding analysis is important in featuring ligand-protein binding,
as hydrogen bonds can steer the binding strength of small
molecules. Through the built-in module of GROMACS software,
we calculated the number and the population of hydrogen bonds
between ligands and proteins in a time-dependent manner
FIGURE 4

Frontiers inImmunology frontiersin.org10
(Figure 5B ). The average numbers of hydrogen bonds between Rh2
and EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 were 0.756, 0.928, and 1.526,
respectively, with maximum intermolecular hydrogen bonds
reaching 5, 4, and 5 during the simulation. These results suggest
the presence of a stable hydrogen-bonding network that enhances
binding af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity. To evaluate local ﬂexibility, per-
residue RMSF was analyzed. As illustrated in Figure 5C , most
residues in all three complexes exhibited low ﬂuctuations (< 0.3
nm), suggesting reduced ﬂexibility and increased rigidity upon Rh2
binding. This attenuation of residual mobility further supports the
stabilizing effect conferred by ligand interaction. The Rg was
employed to assess the global compactness and structural
integrity of the proteins. Throughout the simulation, the Rg
values for Rh2-EGFR, Rh2-JAK1, and Rh2-STAT3 complexes
remained con ﬁned within narrow ranges of 1.933~2.027 nm,
1.945~2.014 nm, and 3.392~3.511 nm, respectively ( Figure 5D ).
These consistently low pro ﬁles suggest no signiﬁ cant unfolding or
structural loosening occurred, indicating well-maintained
compactness in all complexes. Furthermore, the SASA was
monitored to probe changes in surface exposure and hydrophobic
core packing. The SASA values ﬂuctuated mildly within the ranges
of 139.04~159.90 nm², 136.59~152.63 nm², and 258.03~279.50 nm²
for the three complexes ( Figure 5E), implying that the hydrophobic
cores remained buried and no major structural rearrangements
took place. To gain deeper insights into the energetic stability and
conformational ensembles of the complexes, the free energy
landscape (FEL) was constructed using RMSD and Rg as reaction
coordinates. RMS captured conformational departure from the
initial structure, while Rg re ﬂected overall compactness. The FEL
was built based on three-dimensional data involving RMSD, Rg,
and Gibbs free energy, and visualized both as 3D surfaces and 2
contour plots ( Figures 6A –F). A color gradient from red standing
for high free energy to blue standing for low free energy was used to
represent energy values. Blue regions correspond to energy minima,

indicative of the most stable and compact conformational states.
The Gibbs free energy values for the stabilized ensembles of Rh2 –
EGFR (Figures 6A, B), Rh2–JAK1 (Figures 6C, D), and Rh2 –STAT3
(Figures 6E, F) complexes were found to lie between 0 and 3.35 kcal/
mol. Each system exhibited at least one pronounced global energy
minimum, signifying a thermodynamically favorable state. These
results con ﬁrm that all complexes achieved energetically stable
conformations, further supporting the structural stability inferred
from the MD simulations from a thermodynamic perspective.
3.7 Molecular mechanics Poisson-
Boltzmann surface area analysis
The MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations were performed
using the last 10 ns of the stabilize d trajectory from the molecular
dynamics simulation of each complex. One frame per 10 frames was
extracted, yielding a total of 150 frames for the computation. The
results are presented in Figures 6G–I, the binding free energies and
their components for the complexes of ginsenoside Rh2 with EGFR,

JAK1, and STAT3 are summarized in Table 2. The total binding free
energies ( DTOTAL) were calculated to be –21.78 kcal/mol, –23.74
kcal/mol, and –28.30 kcal/mol for the EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3
complexes, respectively, indicating strong spontaneous binding in all
cases. The van der Waals interactions (DVDWAALS) and electrostatic
contributions ( DEEL) were major favorable drivers for complex
formation, with values of –27.03 and –7.76 for EGFR, –32.16 and –
14.14 for JAK1, and –46.38 and –24.37 for STAT3. The gas-phase free
energy ( DGGAS) was also highly favorable across all systems.
Conversely, the polar solvation term ( DEPB) opposed binding,
whereas the nonpolar solvation component ( DENPOLAR)
contributed favorably. These e nergy decompositions provide
thermodynamic insight into the binding mechanisms and af ﬁrm the
robustness of the interactions between ginsenoside Rh2 and the
target proteins.
3.8 PZH and ginsenoside Rh2 suppress
LPS-induced inﬂammatory cytokine
secretion in RAW264.7 macrophages
Nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages was
signiﬁcantly increased through LPS stimulation compared to the VC
group ( P < 0.01). However, treatment with PZH and ginsenoside
Rh2, under all tested doses, signi ﬁcantly reduced NO levels in a dose-
dependent manner ( P < 0.01) ( Figure 7A ). Additionally, LPS
induction triggered robust secretion of pro-in ﬂammatory cytokines
TNF-a,I L - 6 ,a n dI L - 1 b (P < 0.01), whereas both PZH and
ginsenoside Rh2 signi ﬁcantly attenuated their release ( P < 0.01),
with efﬁcacy signiﬁcantly depended on the dose ( Figures 7B–D).
3.9 PZH and ginsenoside Rh2 attenuate
LPS-induced M1 polarization in RAW264.7
macrophages via suppression of IRF5
expression
Compared to the VC group, LPS stimulation signi ﬁcantly
upregulated the expression of IRF5 — a key transcription factor
driving M1 polarization — in RAW264.7 macrophages, con ﬁrming
successful induction of pro-in ﬂammatory M1 polarization.
However, at all the tested doses, treatment with PZH and
ginsenoside Rh2 signi ﬁcantly suppressed IRF5 expression
compared to the LPS-induced model group ( P <0 . 0 1 )
(Figures 7E , F). Both interventions exhibited dose-dependent and
statistically signiﬁcant inhibitory effects. These ﬁndings suggest that
PZH and ginsenoside Rh2 effectively attenuate LPS-induced M1
macrophage polarization by modulating IRF5, a key transcriptional
regulator of in ﬂammatory macrophage activation.
3.10 PZH and ginsenoside Rh2 inhibit the
EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway in
LPS-stimulated macrophages and hepatic
ﬁbrosis models
Both PZH and ginsenoside Rh2 signi ﬁcantly suppressed the
overexpression of EGFR, p-JAK1/JAK1, and p-STAT3/STAT3
proteins in the LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages compared
to the LPS model group ( P < 0.01) ( Figures 8A–D). Additionally, in
the hepatic ﬁbrosis mouse model, ﬁbrotic liver tissues exhibited
marked upregulation of EGFR, p-JAK1/JAK1, and p-STAT3/
STAT3 protein expression ( P < 0.01), accompanied by increased
phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 ( P < 0.01). PZH treatment
effectively reversed these alterations by reducing both the total
protein expression and phosphorylation levels of JAK1 and
STAT3 ( Figures 8E , F). These ﬁndings highlight that PZH
treatment attenuates liver ﬁbrosis and in ﬂammation via the
EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. These observations are
consistent with the ﬁndings from the bioinformatics analysis.
4 Discussion
Hepatic ﬁbrosis is a progressive disease driven by chronic liver
injury, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular
matrix (ECM) and disruption of hepatic architecture. Currently,
the pathogenesis of the disease is incompletely understood, and the
available therapeutic options have limited ef ﬁcacy. PZH, a well-
established traditional Chines e medicinal formula, comprises
natural compounds such as Calculus Bovis, Moschus, Snake
Gallbladder, and Radix Notoginseng. It exerts anti-in ﬂammatory,
antioxidant, anti-ﬁbrotic, and hepatoprotective effects. Research has
demonstrated that it confers therapeutic effects against diverse liver
disorders, such as viral hepatitis, cholestasis, and cirrhosis ( 37).
However, its speci ﬁc molecular mechanisms in the treatment of
ﬁbrosis in hepatic ﬁbrosis have not been extensively elucidated.
Long-term clinical practices have indicated that TCM formulae,
containing diverse herbs with multiple active ingredients, can regulate
complex pathogenic networks in a comprehensive manner. Studies
have shown that PZH exempli ﬁes the TCM holistic approach, which
adheres to the principles of “ruler, minister, and auxiliaries ” and
targeting disease mechanisms by “clearing heat, removing toxins,
activating blood circulation, and removing blood stasis. ” This

formula includes Niuhuang, which is the principal component that
clears heat, detoxify, and expel phlegm. Musk (the major ingredient)
can activate blood circulation and relieve swelling and pain; while
Panax notoginseng and snake gall as adjuvant ingredients, can resolve
blood stasis and relieve bile congestion. This synergy reﬂects the TCM
approach to treating liver ﬁbrosis, focusing on clearing heat, resolving
blood stasis, and dispersing knots ( 38). Studies have shown that PZH
can treat metabolic diseases such as chronic hepatitis and severe fatty
liver ( 39). Although PZH can prevent and treat liver ﬁbrosis, its
mechanisms of action have not been fully explored. This study,
therefore, investigated the pharmacological effects of PZH on liver
ﬁbrosis and its underlying molecular pathways.
The administration of PZH has been shown to ameliorate CCl
4-
induced liver ﬁbrosis in rats ( 40). Speciﬁcally, PZH effectively inhibits
the in ﬁltration of in ﬂammatory cells and the production of pro-
inﬂammatory factors induced by CCl 4, while concurrently
suppressing the activation of the NF- kB pathway. In this study, we
further demonstrated that PZH attenuated CCL4-induced liver injury
in mice, AST, ALT levels and histological analyses, including H&E
and Masson’s trichrome staining, corroborated that PZH effectively
reversed CCL
4-induced liver injury, inﬂammatory inﬁltration,ﬁbrous
tissue proliferation, and collagen deposition. To further con ﬁrm the
anti-hepatic ﬁbrosis effect of PZH, we selected RAW264.7 cells with
similar phenotypes, which were widely used in in ﬂammatory cell
model studies, in vitro experiments. The hepatic in ﬂammatory
response is a hallmark of liver ﬁbrosis. The progression of liver
ﬁbrosis is often accompanied by chronic in ﬂammation and
macrophage activation, all of which exacerbate ﬁbrosis. Activated
macrophages accumulate at the site of liver injury, where they secrete
inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby perpetuating the
inﬂammatory response and ﬁbrosis ( 41). In our study, PZH
effectively inhibited the production of NO, TNF- a, IL-6, and IL-1 b
in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and in vivo, which
implies that this treatment may exert strong anti-in ﬂammatory
effects. The observed downregulation of these cytokines aligns with
the noted reduction in macrophage in ﬁltration and polarization,
thereby reinforcing the hypothesis that PZH modulates the
immune microenvironment to mitigate ﬁbrosis progression.
Cyberpharmacology has been recognized to identify disease-
related pharmacotherapeutic targets by synthesizing large datasets
for virtual screening based on TCM components and associated
symptoms (42). To dissect the potential mechanism by which PZH
exerts anti-liver ﬁbrosis, we performed a network pharmacology
analysis. We identi ﬁed 24 active ingredients, including quercetin,
ursolic acid, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, b-elemene, lauric acid, and
ginsenoside Rh2. In the subsequent analysis, 196 hub genes associated
with liver ﬁbrosis were identi ﬁed, including AKT1, IL6, TNF, TP53,
VEGFA, JUN, IL1B, EGFR, CASP3, PTGS2, MYC, ESR1, STAT3,
HIF1A, MMP9, and EGF. These genes participate in diverse
metabolic pathways that modulate liver ﬁbrosis and were the
cardinal genes in the PPI network, highlighting their importance in
the progression of liver ﬁbrosis. EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 were

prioritized among 20 core targets based on functional coherence,
clinical relevance, and computational support. This axis represents a
well-established cascade in hepatic ﬁbrogenesis, with clinical evidence
correlating its activation to the severity of ﬁbrosis. Molecular docking
studies have con ﬁrmed a high binding af ﬁnity of ginsenoside Rh2 to
these targets. These predictions were further substantiated by MD
simulations, which demonstrated that ginsenoside Rh2 forms stable
complexes with all three target proteins. Throughout the 100 ns
simulation trajectories, the RMSD of the ligand –protein complexes
remained consistently low, and the binding free energy ( DG) values
were signi ﬁcantly negative. These results provide robust structural
and energetic evidence supporting the strong binding af ﬁnity and
stability between ginsenoside Rh2 and the core targets. GO and
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that PZH regulated
various biological functions associated with immune response, cell
proliferation, and antioxidant activity. The signaling pathways
regulated by PZH, included those involved in cancer, glucose
metabolism, hepatitis B, TNF, and IL-17. Notably, the core targets
such as EGF, EGFR, and STAT3 were enriched in the EGFR/JAK1/
STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been linked to the development
of liver injury, in ﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis. As with Ge ﬁtinib-induced
EGFR degradation ( 43), JAK1 destabilization by SOCS1 ( 44), or
STAT3 autotranscription blockade ( 45), our molecular docking
suggests that high-af ﬁnity binders in PZH — particularly ginsenoside
Rh2— engage analogous regulatory mechanisms. In the early stages of
liver injury, EGF and damage-a ssociated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) released from hepatocytes activate the EGFR receptor on
HSCs, initiating autophosphorylation, thereby activating JAK1 and
STAT3 phosphorylation. This activation triggers HSC
transformation into myo ﬁbroblasts, inhibiting ECM degradation
(46).Molecular docking simulations suggest that ginsenoside Rh2 —
a bioactive constituent of PZH— may attenuate hepatic ﬁbrosis
through modulation of the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling axis.
Collectively, our results suggest that PZH exerts pharmacological

effects on liver ﬁbrosis by modulating the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3
signaling pathway.
Activation of the EGFR and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways has
been shown to promote pro-in ﬂammatory polarization in
macrophages, thereby accelerating hepatic ﬁbrosis through
mechanisms such as in ﬂammation regulation, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis. Preclinical studies indicate that pharmacological inhibition
of JAK1/STAT3 signaling can suppress macrophage-driven
inﬂammatory responses ( 47). And in a murine model of hepatic
ﬁbrosis induced by CCL 4, increased EGFR expression and STAT3
activation in hepatic macrophages were positively associated with M1
macrophage inﬁltration and collagen deposition ( 48). These ﬁndings
collectively suggest that targeting the EGFR and JAK1/STAT3
signaling pathway may offer a therapeutic strategy to modulate
macrophage in ﬂammatory phenotypes in ﬁbrotic liver disease. In
our experiments, PZH administration signi ﬁcantly reduced the
expression of EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 in liver tissues compared to
liver ﬁbrosis mice. In vitroexperiments showed that PZH reduced the
LPS-induced expression of EGFR, JAK1, and STAT3 proteins and
inhibited pro-inﬂammatory macrophage polarization in RAW264.7
cells. These results, were consistent with the bioinformatics ﬁndings,
implying that PZH modulated liver ﬁbrosis by regulating the EGFR/
JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibiting macrophage
M1 polarization.
The anti-in ﬂammatory and immunomodulatory properties of
ginsenoside Rh2, a pivotal bioac tive component in Pien Tze Huang,
are mediated by its capacity to selectively regulate macrophage
polarization and the downstream pro-in ﬂammatory signaling
cascades. Recent studies further und erscore the pleiotropic effects of
saponins in modulating critical signaling cascades. Notably,
Saikosaponin-a (SSA), a triterpenoid saponin from Radix Bupleuri,
was shown to enhance chemosensitivity in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma by targeting the p-AKT/BCL-6/ABCA1 axis
(49). This aligns with our ﬁndings that ginsenos ide Rh2 attenuated
the LPS-induced inﬂammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages
by inhibiting the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 axis, a critical pathway that
drives macrophage activation and e nhances cytokine storm. This is
aligns with the emerging evidence that STAT3 hyperactivation
promotes chronic in ﬂammation in ﬁbrotic liver microenvironments
by perpetuating macrophage-epithelial crosstalk and extracellular
matrix deposition ( 50). Notably, the Rh2 ’s capacity to modulate the
pattern recognition receptor signaling and JAK/STAT pathways
suggests a polypharmacologi cal mechanism distinct from
conventional single-target anti-in ﬂammatory agents. Given its
potential to concurrently reduce the production of pro-in ﬂammatory
mediators NO, TNF-a,I L - 6 ,I L - 1b and elevate regulatory cytokines IL-
10 and TGF- b, it can be inferred that it rebalance the macrophage
functional states rather than achieve broad immunosuppression. This is
particularly relevant in hepatic ﬁbrosis, where excessive STAT3
activation has been shown to exacerbate in ﬂammasome activity and
hepatocyte pyroptosis (51).
The observed suppression of IRF5, a master regulator of pro-
inﬂammatory macrophage polarization, provide additional evidence
for the role of Rh2 in the reprogramming of transcriptional networks
that modulate immune responses. Intriguingly, the Rh2-mediated
EGFR inhibition can disrupt a feedforward loop in which, STAT3
activation promotes the EGFR expression, creating a self-reinforcing
inﬂammatory circuit. Spatial transcriptomic evidence generated from
in vivo models ( 52) complements the in vitro ﬁndings, which
demonstrates the Rh2 ’s preferential targeting of periportal
macrophages— key drivers of zonal in ﬂammation in ﬁbrotic livers.
It capacity to silence Nlrp3 and Asc in these spatially restricted
populations suggests that it can also mitigate in ﬂammasome-driven
tissue damage while preserving homeostatic macrophage functions in
uninjured regions.
Our previous research demonstrated that PZH mitigates ﬁbrosis
by inhibiting the TGF- b1/Smad2 signaling pathway, a critical driver
of HSC activation and ECM deposition ( 10). The current study
expands upon this mechanistic insight by elucidating PZH ’s
simultaneous modulation of the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling axis.
Although these pathways predominantly operate within distinct
cellular contexts — TGF-b/Smad2 primarily in HSCs and EGFR/
JAK1/STAT3 in macrophages — they exhibit signi ﬁcant crosstalk.
Notably, TGF- b1 can transactivate EGFR in HSCs through
metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of EGFR ligands such as
HB-EGF, establishing a feedforward loop that ampli ﬁes ﬁbrogenic
signaling ( 53). Furthermore, phosphorylated Smad2/3 and STAT3
can form transcriptional complexes that co-regulate pro- ﬁbrotic
genes, including a-SMA and TIMP1 ( 54). Additionally,
macrophage-derived TGF- b1 activates HSCs, while macrophage
STAT3 sustains IL-6/gp130 signaling, thereby further enhancing
TGF-b responses in HSCs ( 55). The recent identi ﬁcation of PZH ’s
modulation of the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway enhances its known
inhibitory effects on the TGF- b1/Smad2 axis, thereby elucidating a
multifaceted mechanism against hepatic ﬁbrosis. Future research
should focus on delineating the temporal dynamics between these
pathways to optimize strategies for combinatorial targeting.
The study shows PZH’sa n t i -ﬁbrotic effects but has limitations due
to its reliance on a CCl 4-induced mouse model, which limits statistical
power and clinical relevance. CCl 4 models basic ﬁbrosis mechanisms
but doesn’t represent major human causes like NAFLD or HBV. While
CCl4 inducesﬁbrosis through HSC activation and NF-kBi nﬂammation,
NAFLD and HBV involve different pathways (56, 57). Thus, validation
with human hepatocytes or divers em o d e l si sn e e d e d .A l t h o u g hn o
acute toxicity was found in the short term, long-term safety studies are
crucial, especially for herb-drug interactions and potential liver issues.
Additionally, although ginsenoside Rh2 serves as a signiﬁcant effector,
the synergistic interactions among PZH constituents have yet to be
elucidated. Furthermore, while RAW264.7 cells are utilized to
investigate conserved signaling pathways, the species-speciﬁcn a t u r eo f
immune responses suggests the futu re application of iPSC-derived
macrophages or Kupffer-hepatocyte co-cultures (58).
Our network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses
functioned as hypothesis-generating tools intrinsically linked to
experimental validation, thereby establishing a computational-to-
empirical continuum. For the mul ti-component PZH formulation,
network pharmacology prioritized core targets and identi ﬁed the
enriched EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway from 196 candidate genes.
This approach prevented indiscriminate target validation and
strategically guided subsequent in vivo and in vitro experimental

designs. Molecular docking further conﬁrmed high-afﬁnity binding of
ginsenoside Rh2 to these targets, providing a structural rationale for
PZH’s selective pathway modulation. This bridged the mechanistic gap
between PZH’so b s e r v e da n t i -ﬁbrotic efﬁcacy and its target speci ﬁcity,
establishing a causal cascade from binding af ﬁnity to pathway
inhibition and protein downregulation — consistent with prior
pharmacological evidence ( 59). Collectively, these computational
methods captured the essence of TCM by elucidating multi-
component, multi-target interactions inherent to compound
formulae. Critically, all predictions underwent rigorous experimental
veriﬁcation, demonstrating a replicable framework for deconvoluting
mechanisms of complex TCM formulations while enhancing
methodological rigor. While molecular docking provided valuable
insights into the potential binding of ginsenoside Rh2 to EGFR,
JAK1, and STAT3, it is important to note that computational af ﬁnity
predictions do not unequivocally demonstrate functional target
modulation within a cellular context. The absence of direct functional
validation, such as cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), surface
plasmon resonance (SPR), or co-immunoprecipitation experiments,
constitutes a limitation of the current study. Importantly, no direct
causal relationship has been established between the molecular docking
scores and the observed downregu lation of protein expression. The
docking results suggest only a potential for binding and do not prove
that such binding events directly l ead to functional inhibition or
changes in the expression levels of the target proteins. Future
investigations should incorporate these methodologies to con ﬁrm
direct target engagement and f urther elucidate the precise
mechanisms by which PZH constituents regulate the EGFR/JAK1/
STAT3 signaling axis.
In summary, PZH can exert potent anti-in ﬂammatory and anti-
hepatic ﬁbrosis effects due to its multiple bioactive constituents.
These components collectively exert anti- ﬁbrotic actions via multi-
pathway and multi-target mechanisms, thereby modulating hepatic
ﬁbrogenesis. In a CCL 4-induced mice model, PZH signi ﬁcantly
alleviated hepatic in ﬂammation and ﬁbrotic severity, ameliorating
liver injury by inhibiting the EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway
and pro-in ﬂammatory polarization of hepatic macrophages. This
mechanistic interplay highlights the PZH ’s capacity to disrupt
pathological cascades driving ﬁbrosis progression while preserving
hepatic immune homeostasis.
5 Conclusion
In brief, the current work showed that PZH may act as a
therapeutic agent for liver ﬁbrosis by inhibiting the EGFR/JAK1/
STAT3 signaling axis and macrophage M1 polarization. Future
research should focus on understanding the roles of PZH
components like quercetin and ursolic acid in ﬁbrosis and their
interaction with ginsenoside Rh2. Investigating cell-type-speci ﬁc
mechanisms, especially macrophage-hepatocyte interactions, using
spatial transcriptomics is essential due to PZH ’s targeting of
periportal macrophages. Additionally, improving delivery systems,
such as nanocarriers, to boost the bioavailability and liver targeting
of active ingredients is a key translational goal.
