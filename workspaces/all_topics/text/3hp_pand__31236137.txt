Abstract 
Background: 3‑Hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP) is a promising platform chemical with various industrial applications. 
Several metabolic routes to produce 3‑HP from organic substrates such as sugars or glycerol have been implemented 
in yeast, enterobacterial species and other microorganisms. In this study, the native 3‑HP metabolism of Cupriavidus 
necator was investigated and manipulated as it represents a promising chassis for the production of 3‑HP and other 
fatty acid derivatives from  CO
2 and  H2.
Results: When testing C. necator for its tolerance towards 3‑HP , it was noted that it could utilise the compound as 
the sole source of carbon and energy, a highly undesirable trait in the context of biological 3‑HP production which 
required elimination. Inactivation of the methylcitrate pathway needed for propionate utilisation did not affect the 
organism’s ability to grow on 3‑HP . Putative genes involved in 3‑HP degradation were identified by bioinformatics 
means and confirmed by transcriptomic analyses, the latter revealing considerably increased expression in the pres‑
ence of 3‑HP . Genes identified in this manner encoded three putative (methyl)malonate semialdehyde dehydroge‑
nases (mmsA1, mmsA2 and mmsA3) and two putative dehydrogenases (hpdH and hbdH). These genes, which are part 
of three separate mmsA operons, were inactivated through deletion of the entire coding region, either singly or in 
various combinations, to engineer strains unable to grow on 3‑HP . Whilst inactivation of single genes or double dele‑
tions could only delay but not abolish growth, a triple ∆mmsA1∆mmsA2∆mmsA3 knock‑out strain was unable utilise 
3‑HP as the sole source of carbon and energy. Under the used conditions this strain was also unable to co–metabolise 
3‑HP alongside other carbon and energy sources such as fructose and  CO
2/H2. Further analysis suggested primary 
roles for the different mmsA operons in the utilisation of β‑alanine generating substrates (mmsA1), degradation of 
3‑HP (mmsA2), and breakdown of valine (mmsA3).
Conclusions: Three different (methyl)malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenases contribute to 3‑HP breakdown in C. 
necator H16. The created triple ∆mmsA1∆mmsA2∆mmsA3 knock‑out strain represents an ideal chassis for autotrophic 
3‑HP production.

Introduction
Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia eutropha) strain 
H16 is a well-studied β-proteobacterium capable of auto -
trophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth [1]. Due 
to its ability to grow chemolithoautotrophically on  CO
2 
and  H2, and to store vast amounts of fixed carbon in 
the form of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), it is a promis -
ing candidate for the sustainable production of chemical 
commodities from waste gases [2–4]. When growing het
-
erotrophically, it can utilise a wide range of organic com -
pounds as the sole sources of carbon and energy [5, 6]. 
Although catabolism of carbohydrate derivatives is lim -
ited to the utilisation of fructose, gluconate and N-acetyl-
glucosamine, the organism is able to grow on fatty acids, 
alcohols, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, oleic 
acid derivatives, and aromatic compounds [7–10]. Short 
chain fatty acids such as acetic acid, butyric acid and pro
-
pionic acid, as well as hydroxylated fatty acids such as 
3-hydroxypropionic acid can either support growth or be 
incorporated into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) under 
certain conditions [11–13].
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a promising plat
-
form chemical with multiple industrial applications, 
including the conversion to acrylic acid, acrylamide, pro
-
pandiol and 3-HP polymers. It is one of the top 12 value-
added chemicals which can be derived from biomass, 
according to a study by the United States Department of 
Energy [14]. When considering biological production of 
chemical commodities such as 3-HP , it is important to 
ensure that the generated compounds are not re-metab
-
olised by the producing organism at any stage during 
the process. This might be achieved by either metabolic 
or process engineering. In this work, we investigated the 
native 3-HP metabolism in C. necator strain H16 with the 
aim of engineering a strain incapable of 3-HP utilisation, 
to be used as a chassis for the future introduction of bio
-
synthetic routes towards its production.
There are two main pathways that have been proposed 
for assimilation of 3-HP in different organisms: a reduc -
tive route and an oxidative route [15–18]. The former is 
CoA-dependent and comprises the reductive conver
-
sion of 3-HP to propionyl-CoA via the intermediates 
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA and acrylyl-CoA. This path
-
way has been well studied in the phototrophic organism 
Chloroflexus aurantiacus where a propionyl-Coenzyme 
A synthase carries out the above reaction sequence as 
part of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle for  CO
2 fixa -
tion [19]. Moreover, a similar route has been proposed 
for 3-HP assimilation in the photoheterotrophic bacte
-
rium Rhodobacter sphaeroides [15]. In this case, a can -
didate enzyme that most likely catalyses the reductive 
conversion of acrylyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA, Acul, has 
been identified [20]. In C. necator H16, a propionate 
CoA-transferase (Pct) has been identified and charac
-
terised. It exhibits similarities in terms of sequence and 
structure with Pct from C. propionicum and its broad 
substrate specificity resulted in its classification as a fam
-
ily I Coenzyme A transferase [21]. Using acetyl-CoA as 
a CoA donor, the list of carboxylic acids that can act as 
CoA acceptors in a Pct-catalysed reaction includes com
-
pounds such as propionate, butyrate, 3-HP , 3-hydroxy -
butyrate, crotonate, acrylate, and others [22]. Propionate 
was identified as the best substrate followed by 3-HP , 
3-HB and acrylate [21]. More recently, in a study for 
the production of acrylic acid via 3-HP , 3-HP-CoA and 
acrylyl-CoA, Pct from C. necator H16 was identified as 
the most active CoA-transferase to catalyse the conver
-
sion from 3-HP to 3-HP-CoA among 14 candidates from 
other organisms [23]. This opened the possibility that 
3-HP breakdown in C. necator could follow the reductive 
route via propionyl-CoA as proposed by Peplinski et  al. 
[24], a hypothesis further supported by the observation 
that propionate is readily degraded by the organism via 
the methylcitric acid pathway [25].
On the other hand, in the much shorter CoA-inde
-
pendent route, 3-HP would be oxidised to malonate 
semialdehyde, which would then be decarboxylated and 
thus converted to acetyl-CoA, ready to enter interme
-
diary metabolism. Recent attempts to use engineered 
Pseudomonas denitrificans for the production of 3-HP 
from glycerol have shown that subsequent breakdown of 
the generated compound resulted in low yields [17, 26]. 
Specific inhibition of acid dehydrogenases completely 
blocked 3-HP assimilation, and detection of malonic and 
methyl malonic acids in samples analysed by GC/MS 
strengthened the hypothesis that breakdown might occur 
via the oxidative route [26]. Indeed, follow-up stud
-
ies identified and characterised several dehydrogenases 
involved in the oxidation of 3-HP to malonate semialde
-
hyde and their inactivation led to a strain unable to use 
3-HP as sole carbon source [17, 27, 28]. Some of these 
genes have been shown to be organised in operons which 
are induced by 3-HP , including a (methyl)malonate semi
-
aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (mmsA ) and a 3-hydroxy -
iso-butyrate dehydrogenase gene (hbdH) [29]. Findings 
made for other organisms such as an active 3-hydroxy
-
propionate dehydrogenase in Bacillus cereus and a pro -
pionate degradation pathway (via 3-HP and malonate 
semialdehyde to acetyl-CoA) in Candida albicans sug
-
gest that the oxidative route is more widely used [16, 30].
Here, we report on the identification of several genes 
involved in 3-HP utilisation in C. necator H16, including 
three putative (methyl)malonate semialdehyde dehydro
-
genases and two putative dehydrogenases. The combined 
deletion of the former three genes resulted in a strain 
unable to grow on 3-HP as a source of carbon and energy.

Results
Utilisation of 3‑HP as the sole carbon and energy source 
does not require the methylcitrate pathway
When C. necator H16 was grown in minimal medium 
containing 0.4% fructose (F-MM) and supplemented 
with increasing concentrations of 3-HP (0–256  mM), 
higher final optical densities (ODs) were observed in the 
presence of 3-HP compared to cultures grown in F-MM 
alone (Fig.  1a). This suggested that 3-HP could be used 
as a carbon source in addition to fructose, unless pro
-
vided at very high and presumably toxic concentrations 
(> 128  mM). To investigate this further, C. necator H16 
was grown in minimal medium (MM) containing 50 mM 
3-HP as the sole source of carbon and energy. Under 
these conditions, the provided 3-HP was completely con
-
sumed (Fig.  1b) confirming that it could support growth 
of the organism in MM.
It has been reported that C. necator H16 can activate 
3-HP to 3-HP-CoA [21]. Furthermore, transcriptomic 
data from C. necator H16 cultivated on gluconate in 
presence of 3,3′-thiodipropionic acid (TDP) suggested 
that the generated TDP cleavage product 3-HP might 
be converted to propionyl-CoA and further metabolised 
to acetyl-CoA via the 2-methylcitrate pathway [24]. This 
hypothesis was tested by deleting the entire encoding 
gene cluster consisting of prpR, prpB, prpC, acnM, orf5 
and prpD, previously shown to be required for propi
-
onate metabolism [25]. However, this deletion had very 
little effect on growth and consumption of 3-HP when 
provided as the sole source of carbon and energy (Addi
-
tional file  1: Figure S1), whereas it completely abolished 
growth on propionate, in agreement with previous find -
ings [25].
Identification of C. necator H16 genes predicted to play 
a role in 3‑HP metabolism
Given the continued consumption of 3-HP in the absence 
of a functional methylcitrate pathway, the H16 genome 
was interrogated for the presence of alternative 3-HP 
utilisation genes, including those encoding the CoA-
independent route via malonate semialdehyde (Fig.  2). 
Indeed, three putative (methyl)malonate semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase genes, mmsA1 (H16_A0273), mmsA2 
(H16_A3664) and mmsA3 (H16_B1191), required for the 
oxidative decarboxylation of malonate semialdehyde to 
acetyl-CoA or, potentially, methylmalonate to propionyl-
CoA, were found to be present in the genome and are 
annotated as such.
In P. denitrificans, 3-HP degradation genes are clustered 
in two separate operons each preceded by a divergently 
transcribed LysR-type regulator gene [17, 29]. The so-
called C4 operon contains a (methyl)malonate semialde
-
hyde dehydrogenase (mmsA) and a 3-hydroxyisobutyrate 
dehydrogenase gene (hbdH), whereas the C3 operon is 
monocistronic and consists of a single 3-hydroxypropi
-
onate dehydrogenase gene (hpdH ). Screening of 3-HP-
inducible systems in other microorganisms has suggested 
that a similar gene organisation might be found in 
Cupriavidus species [29]. To identify potential candi

dates of 3-hydroxypropionate/isobutyrate dehydroge -
nase genes in C. necator H16, the P. denitrificans HpdH 
(H681_18525) and HbdH (H681_13440) proteins were

used for primary blastP searches as described in “Meth -
ods” . These identified two potential targets: P. denitrifi -
cans HpdH displayed 60% identity with the product of a 
gene annotated as choline dehydrogenase (H16_A3663) 
and located immediately downstream of the C. neca -
tor mmsA2 gene, whereas HbdH displayed 66% identity 
with an annotated 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase 
(H16_B1190) encoded immediately downstream the 
C. necator mmsA3 gene. No additional putative mmsA  
homologues could be identified in similar searches using 
the P. denitrificans MmsA protein (H681_13435). These 
findings suggested that a complete oxidative 3-HP utilisa
-
tion pathway does indeed exist in C. necator (Fig. 2b), but 
is erroneously presented as incomplete in popular data -
bases such as KEGG pathway [31] due to the misannota -
tion of H16_A3663.
Further interrogation of the regions surrounding the 
three C. necator mmsA genes revealed the presence 
of additional genes potentially required for (methyl)
malonate semialdehyde generation from substrates other 
than 3-HP . The aptA gene (H16_A0272) located imme
-
diately upstream of mmsA1 encodes a putative β-alanine 
pyruvate transaminase responsible for the conversion 
of β-alanine to malonate semialdehyde. A gene anno
-
tated as acaD (H16_B1192) encoding a putative acyl-
CoA dehydrogenase is located immediately upstream of 
mmsA3. Downstream of mmsA3 are the aforementioned 
hbdH (H16_B1190) and also putative genes annotated 
as encoding 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (H16_
B1189, crt) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase (H16_
B1188), all separated by very short intergenic regions.
The above findings suggested the existence of three 
distinct mmsA gene clusters and potentially operons as 
shown in Fig.  2a. Similar to what has been described for 
P. denitrificans, a divergently transcribed transcriptional 
regulator gene forms part of each cluster and is located 
immediately upstream of the respective mmsA  operon. 
The existence of three separate operons and their indi
-
vidual composition suggested that they contribute to the 
degradation of either methylmalonate semialdehyde or 
malonate semialdehyde generated in different metabolic 
contexts or from different metabolic precursors. Based 
on the presence of a putative 3-hydroxypropionate dehy
-
drogenase gene, the mmsA2 operon was hypothesised to 
be of primary importance for 3-HP utilisation, whereas 
the mmsA3 operon was postulated to have its main role 
in valine and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate degradation as shown 
in Additional file 2: Figure S2.
Cupriavidus necator also contains a putative malonyl-
CoA decarboxylase gene, mcd (H16_A2981). As mal
-
onyl-CoA may theoretically be formed from malonate 
semialdehyde or via 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA/3-oxo
-
propionyl-CoA, this gene was also considered to be of 
interest.
Identification of metabolic genes differentially regulated 
in the presence of 3‑HP
Given the existence of three separate mmsA  operons, a 
transcriptomic approach was chosen to identify those 
involved in 3-HP utilisation and to help pinpoint addi -
tional, as yet unidentified, contributing genes. For 
instance, the genes of the 2-methylcitrate pathway, 
whilst not essential for growth on 3-HP , may still con
-
tribute to its conversion. For this, C. necator was grown 
in MM in the presence of either fructose or 3-HP as the 
sole sources of carbon and energy. Cells were harvested 
from triplicate cultures at an  OD
600 of 2 (late exponen -
tial growth), RNA extracted, processed and subjected 
to RNA-seq analysis as described in “Methods ” . The raw 
reads were mapped onto the genome sequence of C. 
necator H16 with an overall alignment rate > 93% and 
analysed using ReadXplorer [32, 33]. The DESeq algo
-
rithm was applied to calculate gene-specific fold changes 
of expression levels [34]. The cohort of genes upregulated 
on 3-HP included all candidate genes shown in Fig.  2a. 
This added confidence that the correct gene clusters had 
been identified. These genes and their relative expression 
are listed in Additional file  3: Table  S1; the entire data 
sets generated and analysed are available in the ArrayEx
-
press repository under accession number E-MTAB-7701.

metabolism remained unconfirmed. By contrast, the 
genes encoding the methylcitrate pathway presented lit -
tle changes in transcription and pct, encoding propionyl-
CoA transferase (H16_A2718), was also not significantly 
changed, suggesting that they were not required for 3-HP 
breakdown.
Besides the mmsA  operons, a number of other meta
-
bolic genes displayed differential expression under the 
two employed conditions (Additional file  3: Table  S1; 
Additional file 4: Figure S3). Among those highly upregu
-
lated in the presence of 3-HP were two genes encoding 
isocitrate lyase isoenzymes (H16_A2211, H16_A2227), 
in accordance with the proposed breakdown via the 
oxidative route, allowing the generated acetyl-CoA to 
enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) via the gly
-
oxylate shunt. Interestingly, genes encoding enzymes 
of the TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis/lower part of the 
Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway and the non-oxidative 
branch of the pentose phosphate pathway were simi
-
larly expressed in 3-HP and fructose grown cells. As 
might be expected, genes required for fructose uptake, 
phosphorylation, conversion to glucose-6-phosphate, 
and first step of the ED pathway were among the most 
highly downregulated in 3-HP-grown cells (between 78- 
and 203-fold; p
adj ≤ 0.0069). Other genes of the upper ED 
pathway showed relatively small or no changes, none of 
which were statistically significant. These included the 
genes for 6-phosphogluconolactonase (H16_B2565, no 
change), 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (H16_B2567, 
no change) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate 
aldolase (B16_B1213, 3.4-fold downregulated; p
adj > 0.05) 
(Additional file  3: Table  S1). A second 6-phosphoglu -
conate dehydratase gene, H16_A1178, was strongly 
downregulated (38-fold), but this change was also not 
significant under the stringent criteria applied here (p
adj 
of 0.0526).
Taken together, the obtained data were consistent with 
the proposed two-step breakdown of 3-HP via the oxi -
dative route, yielding acetyl-CoA, and highlighted the 
importance of the mmsA2 operon.
Generation of a C. necator H16 strain unable to consume 
3‑HP as a sole source of carbon
The three mmsA genes as well as mcd were initially 
selected as targets for gene knockouts to investigate their 
relative contributions to 3-HP breakdown. The respective 
genes were inactivated by deletion of their open reading 
frames (ORFs) and knockouts confirmed by PCR and 
sequencing as described in “Methods ” . The confirmed 
mutants were designated CNCA03 (ΔmmsA1), CNCA04 
(ΔmmsA2), CNCA05 (ΔmmsA3) and CNCA06 (Δmcd), 
respectively, and grown on 3-HP as the sole sources 
of carbon and energy to observe whether any of the 
mutations reduced or even abolished growth. Figure  3a 
shows growth and 3-HP degradation profiles obtained 
in the presence of 50 mM 3-HP-MM. All of the mutants 
eventually grew and completely consumed the provided 
3-HP . However, profiles for two of the mutant strains, 
CNCA04 and CNCA05, differed from that of the wild 
type. Whilst reaching very similar final optical densi
-
ties, mutant CNCA04 consumed 3-HP more slowly and, 
accordingly, grew at a reduced rate. CNCA05 displayed 
what appeared to be an extended lag phase, resulting in a 
slight delay in 3-HP consumption. These results, consist
-
ent with the above bioinformatics predictions and RNA-
seq data, suggested that multiple enzymes contributed 
to 3-HP utilisation, and in particular those encoded by 
the mmsA2 operon. To confirm the relative importance 
of this operon, the hpdH  gene was also inactivated and 
the resulting mutant (CNCA07) compared to a similarly 
created Δ hbdH knockout (CNCA016). In contrast to 
the latter, deletion of hpdH  delayed growth and break
-
down of 3-HP for about 100 h (Additional file  5: Figure 
S4), strongly supporting the hypothesis that the encoded 
3-HP dehydrogenase together with MmsA2 are the main 
contributors to 3-HP breakdown in the H16 wild-type 
strain.
Nevertheless, other enzymes were contributing too, 
and hence it was decided to generate combinations of 
the individual mutations generated thus far. CNCA04 
was chosen as the starting strain, as the ΔmmsA2 muta
-
tion it contained had already been shown to have a 
strong effect on 3-HP degradation. The following double 
mutant strains were generated from CNCA04: CNCA08 
(ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3), CNCA09 (ΔmmsA2Δmcd), 
CNCA10 (ΔmmsA2ΔhpdH ) and CNCA12 
(ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2). In addition, strain CNCA11 
(ΔmmsA3ΔhbdH) was generated from the CNCA05 
strain. As can be observed in Fig.  3b, the double deletion 
of mmsA3 and hbdH did not have any effect on growth 
or degradation of 3-HP as it behaved like the wild-type 
strain. Furthermore, neither the deletion of mmsA3 or 
mcd in the ΔmmsA2 background had an additive effect 
over ΔmmsA2 in terms of growth and 3-HP consump
-
tion. However, strains CNCA10 (ΔmmsA2ΔhpdH ) and 
CNCA12 (ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2) were unable to grow or 
utilise 3-HP within the 70  h window shown here and 
even further until about 120  h and 150  h, respectively. 
After that time, cells started growing and 3-HP was com
-
pletely degraded (Fig.  3c). As stated before, a similar 
behaviour was observed for strain CNCA07, containing a 
single ΔhpdH deletion.
Assuming that this phenomenon was the result of 
an adaptation, leading to the activation of genes not 
normally induced under these conditions, the genes 
already inactivated in CNCA10 and CNCA12 were key

late 3-HP following additional knock-outs. As HpdH 
was considered a desirable enzyme to be maintained in 
a future 3-HP producing strain derivative, only the triple 
mmsA deletion was possible based on the genes identified 
thus far: ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3. The corresponding

strain, designated CNC13, was unable to degrade 3-HP 
as the sole carbon and energy source within the tested 
timeframe of up to 250 h (Fig. 3c).
To confirm that combined deletion of the three mmsA  
genes was indeed responsible for lack of 3-HP assimila
-
tion rather than second site mutations, it was necessary 
to complement the individual knockouts in the final 
mutant strain, CNCA13. As the promoters for these 
genes had not been experimentally characterised, com
-
plementation was carried out by cloning the individual 
mmsA genes into shuttle vector pBBR1MCS-2-PphaC 
[35]. This way, transcription was controlled by the con
-
stitutive phaC promoter and the different mmsA genes 
could be introduced and expressed separately. Introduc -
tion of each mmsA  gene successfully restored growth of 
strain CNCA13 on 3-HP as the sole source of carbon and 
energy (Additional file  6: Figure S5) whereas no discern
-
ible growth was observed for the control strain CNCA13 
carrying the empty pBBR1MCS-2-PphaC vector. Thus, 
together with the above knockout data, it was confirmed 
that the products of all three mmsA  genes contributed to 
3-HP breakdown.
Role of mmsA3 and mcd
Having constructed various ΔmmsA  operon and Δmcd 
mutants, it was of interest to better understand the pri -
mary roles of the encoded gene products and their indi -
vidual contributions to  C3 metabolism. Located close to 
mcd is a gene annotated to encode a putative malonyl-
CoA synthetase (H16_A2978). It therefore seemed likely 
that both genes were required for growth on malonic 
acid, a compound accumulated to a high level by cer
-
tain plants [36]. However, when the H16 parent and its 
CNCA06 (Δmcd) derivative were cultivated in MM 
with malonate as the sole source of carbon and energy 
(50  mM, 25  mM, 12.5  mM), no growth was observed 
for either strain. Thus, the role of the mcd gene prod
-
uct in C. necator metabolism remained uncertain. For 
mmsA3, based on the proposed function of the other 
genes within the operon, a role in valine degradation had 
been hypothesised (Additional file  2: Figure S2). This 
was tested by comparing the growth of the ΔmmsA3 
and ΔhbdH mutants (CNCA05, CNCA11, CNCA13 
and CNCA16) with that of the H16 parent strain in 
the presence of valine as the sole source of carbon and 
energy. Isobutyrate was also tested, as the derived isobu
-
tyryl-CoA is another intermediate in the valine degra -
dation pathway. As can be seen in Fig.  4, in contrast to 
the H16 parent strain, all tested mutants failed to grow 
on these substrates in support of the formulated hypoth
-
esis. Further confirmation was obtained through genetic 
complementation. Introducing complementation vec

tors pBBR1MCS-2-P phaC-mmsA3 and pMTL71301-
PacaD-hbdH into the CNCA05 (ΔmmsA3) and CNCA16 
(ΔhbdH) mutant, respectively, restored growth on valine, 
in contrast to the empty plasmid controls (Additional 
file  7: Figure S6). The same result was obtained for the 
CNCA13 (ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3) triple mutant 
when containing pBBR1MCS-2-P
phaC-mmsA3. Interest -
ingly, complementation of the latter with either mmsA1 
or mmsA2 also restored growth on valine (Additional 
file  7: Figure S6), suggesting that all three mmsA  gene 
products recognised both methylmalonate semialde
-
hyde and malonate semialdehyde as substrates. Oxida -
tive decarboxylation of methylmalonate semialdehyde by 
MmsA enzymes as part of the valine degradation path

way yields propionyl-CoA (Additional file  2: Figure S2).

Degradation of 3‑HP in mmsA mutant strains 
under mixotrophic conditions
The ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3 triple deletion had gen -
erated a strain unable to utilise 3-HP as the sole source 
of carbon and energy. However, it remained unclear 
whether this strain could still co-metabolise 3-HP along
-
side fructose or other carbon sources. In order to investi -
gate this possibility and see the effect of each individual 
mmsA deletion step as well, the different strains (wild 
type, CNCA04, CNCA12 and CNCA13) were incubated 
in MM in the presence of 25  mM fructose and 50  mM 
3-HP .
As can be seen in Fig.  5a, C. necator H16 wild type was 
able to co-metabolise both substrates without any clear 
preference, although 3-HP appeared to be consumed 
more rapidly and was therefore depleted earlier than 
fructose. A similar result was observed for the ΔmmsA2 
mutant, CNCA04 (Fig.  5b), although, as observed when 
cultivated on 3-HP only, it grew more slowly and took 
twice as long to consume 3-HP (about 70 h), with fruc
-
tose only being depleted after 150  h, long after growth 
had ceased. Similarly, the double deletion strain CNCA12 
(ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2; Fig.  5c) and the triple mutant strain 
CNCA13 (ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3; Fig.  5d), whilst 
not metabolising the provided 3-HP over the entire 
course of the experiment (240  h) displayed drastically 
increased lag phases. An initial growth delay of approx
-
imately 50  h was observed for both strains in compari -
son to the wild-type strain and fructose was consumed 
comparatively slowly with depletion occurring more than 
150 h after inoculation. This may have been the result of 
regulatory control, leading to reduced expression of fruc
-
tose utilisation genes due to the continued presence of 
3-HP or absence of its breakdown intermediates.
The ultimate aim of this study was to engineer C. neca
-
tor strains unable to degrade 3-HP when using  CO2 and 
 H2 as carbon and energy sources. The H16 wild type and 
CNCA13 strains were hence tested for 3-HP degrada -
tion when cultivated under mixotrophic conditions. For

this, both strains were grown in serum bottles with butyl-
rubber stoppers containing 24  mM 3-HP in MM and a 
gas mixture of  H
2,  CO2 and air for a period of 240 h (see 
“Methods” for details). Whilst 3-HP was utilised by the 
wild type cultures under these conditions and completely 
depleted after 190 h, there was no discernable consump
-
tion by the triple mmsA  deletion strain, CNCA13, which 
nevertheless grew on the provided  CO2/H2 mixture 
(Fig. 6).
Discussion
Several microorganisms are known to degrade and grow 
on 3-HP , including R. sphaeroides, P. denitrificans, Meth-
ylobacterium extorquens and several other proteobacte -
ria [15, 29, 37]. C. necator has previously been shown to 
utilise 3-HP to generate PHA co-polymers consisting of 
3-HP and 3-HB [38]. Here, we demonstrate that 3-HP is 
co-metabolised by the H16 strain in the presence of other 
carbon sources and can also serve as the sole source of 
carbon and energy.
Cupriavidus necator is a promising platform organism 
for the autotrophic production of 3-HP . Hence, from a 
metabolic engineering perspective, the observed degra
-
dation was a highly undesirable trait that required elim -
ination. A prerequisite for this was the identification of 
contributing pathways and their encoding genes.
Two principle pathways for 3-HP breakdown have been 
described, a reductive and an oxidative route. Reduc
-
tive breakdown as described for R. sphaeroides requires 
activation to 3-HP-CoA, reduction to propionyl-CoA 
and further conversion of the latter via the methylcitrate 
pathway, yielding pyruvate and succinate [15, 25]. The 
oxidative route as present in, e.g. P. denitrificans is less 
carbon-efficient but much shorter: Oxidation of 3-HP 
yields malonate semialdehyde which is then decarboxy
-
lated to acetyl-CoA [17, 29].
Putative genes for both pathways are present in the 
H16 strain, but contrary to previous suggestions [24], 
3-HP appears to be utilised exclusively via the oxidative 
route, at least under conditions employed in this study: 
inactivation of methylcitrate pathway genes did not affect 
growth on 3-HP , whilst combined inactivation of three 
malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenases completely 
abolished growth and 3-HP breakdown. Thus, C. neca
-
tor oxidises 3-HP to acetyl-CoA, whereas propionate is 
metabolised via a functional methylcitrate pathway [25], 
despite presence of a broad-specificity CoA transferase, 
Pct, capable of converting 3-HP to 3-HP-CoA [21, 22].
Cupriavidus necator is metabolically highly versatile 
[39, 40] and known to employ multiple isoenzymes for 
key reactions in many of its metabolic pathways. Indeed, 
three mmsA genes and at least two candidates for 3-HP 
dehydrogenation are present in the H16 genome and 
form part of three different predicted operons. Pre
-
sumably these operons are serving different primary 
functions and therefore guidance was sought through 
comparative RNA-seq analysis as to which may contrib
-
ute to 3-HP degradation. However, whilst the mmsA2 
operon was amongst the most highly up-regulated genes, 
transcript levels for the other two operons were also 
increased in the presence of 3-HP , suggesting that they 
also contributed to its consumption. This was experi
-
mentally confirmed through a series of single, double 
and triple knockout mutants. The generated final mmsA  
triple knockout strain, CNCA13 showed no discernible 
consumption of 3-HP , even in the presence of organic 
(fructose) or inorganic  (CO
2/H2) co-substrates and an 
extended incubation period of 10  days, hence realising 
the main aim of this study, the engineering of a strain no 
longer capable of utilising 3-HP as a carbon and energy 
source.

Among the single knockouts, hpdH  inactivation was of 
particular interest due to its strong phenotype. Inactiva -
tion of the gene delayed growth on 3-HP for more than 
100 h, thus underlining the key role of the mmsA2 operon 
in 3-HP conversion. Although hpdH was a potential can
-
didate for 3-HP knockout strain construction, this option 
was not pursued. Presence of the gene was considered 
desirable as it might bolster the organism’s capacity to 
convert potentially toxic [41] malonate semialdehyde to 
3-HP in the last step of both malonyl-CoA and β-alanine 
production pathways [42–44]. However, inactivation of 
the native gene could still be an option for future engi
-
neering work. For instance, it might be preferable to 
replace it with a more suitable alternative, depending 
on the desired cofactor preference for this reaction (i.e. 
NADPH vs NADH) or the required kinetic parameters.
Given that inactivation of all three mmsA  genes was 
required to abolish 3-HP consumption, a better under
-
standing of the encoding operons and their individual 
roles in  C
3 metabolism was sought as part of this study to 
ensure they did not affect other important functions. 
mcd was included in this analysis as malonate and mal -
onyl-CoA have been reported to accumulate when 3-HP-
grown cultures of P. denitrificans were treated with the 
acid dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-hydroxy mercuric ben
-
zoic acid [26]. Due to the presence of a putative malonyl-
CoA synthetase gene close by, mcd was hypothesised to 
be required for malonate breakdown but this could not 
be confirmed experimentally as both Δmcd mutant and 
H16 parent strain were unable to grow on malonate 
under the chosen conditions. However, the gene does not 
appear to be involved in 3-HP breakdown as inactivation 
of all three mmsA  homologues was shown to be suffi
-
cient to block degradation. The mmsA1 operon encodes 
a second gene, aptA, annotated as β-alanine-pyruvate 
transaminase. Hence a primary role in the utilisation 
of β-alanine generating substrates is proposed. Indeed, 
C. necator H16 has been reported to degrade and grow 
on β-alanine and carnosine, but not uracil [45, 46]. As 
detailed above, the mmsA2 operon was highly upregu
-
lated in the presence of 3-HP , in agreement with previous 
reporter studies [47], and also encodes the aforemen
-
tioned 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (HpdH) 
required for efficient 3-HP breakdown. Hence its physi
-
ological role as confirmed here is in the degradation of 
3-HP and, potentially, 3-HP generating substrates (one of 
which might be myo-inositol as observed in Lactobacillus 
casei [48]). As outlined in Additional file  2: Figure S2, the 
genes contained within the putative mmsA3 operon were 
postulated to have their main role in valine and 3-hydrox
-
yisobutyrate degradation based on their predicted func -
tions and this was confirmed experimentally for both 
ΔmmsA3 and ΔhbdH knockouts. The respective mutants 
were unable to grow on valine and isobutyrate within 
5 days. Based on the above, it can be assumed that under 
normal physiological conditions MmsA1 and MmsA2 act 
primarily on malonate semialdehyde whereas the physi
-
ological substrate for MmsA3 is methylmalonate semi -
aldehyde. However, despite their separate physiological 
roles, the enzymes’ substrate specificities appear to be 
sufficiently broad to enable conversion of both substrates, 
as illustrated by ability of the different CACA13 com
-
plementation strains to grown on both valine and 3-HP . 
This is in agreement with the literature. Whilst a high 
substrate specificity has been reported for a malonate 
semialdehyde dehydrogenase isolated from Pseudomonas 
sp. strain AAC [49], other enzymes are known to accept 
both substrates [50–52].
It is reasonable to assume that the three C. neca
-
tor mmsA operons as well as mcd are controlled by 
dedicated transcriptional regulators encoded immedi -
ately upstream of each operon, as has been observed 
for many bacteria and specifically for the mmsA  oper
-
ons in P. denitrificans [29, 47, 53]. Control of mmsA2 
by the upstream encoded LysR-type regulator appears 
likely but requires further confirmation as the system 
was not responsive to 3-HP when expressed heterolo
-
gously in E. coli [47]. Similar control of the mmsA1 and 
mmsA3 operons via the upstream encoded MocR and 
AraC-type regulators may also explain the long delay in 
3-HP consumption observed for the ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2 
(CNCA12) and ΔmmsA2ΔhpdH  (CNCA10) double 
mutants as well as the long lag phase observed for the 
ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3 (CNCA13) mutant when 
grown on fructose together with 3-HP . Whilst our H16 
wild type data suggest that both carbon sources can be 
used in parallel, at least at some stages of growth, 3-HP 
appears to be consumed more rapidly. It was thus pos
-
sible that the continuingly high levels of 3-HP in our 
ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA3 (CNCA13) mutant cultures 
prevented or delayed sufficient induction of fructose uti
-
lisation genes.
Comparative RNA-seq analysis of 3-HP and fructose-
grown cells was primarily performed to obtain guidance 
as to which of the three mmsA  operons and potentially 
other genes were involved in 3-HP utilisation. In addi
-
tion, the obtained data yielded some interesting insights 
into the transcriptional changes of genes associated with 
central carbon metabolism (Additional file  4: Figure S3). 
These changes were consistent with the implemented 
change in carbon source and oxidative conversion of 
3-HP to acetyl-CoA. When grown on 3-HP , as might 
be expected, genes required for fructose uptake and 
conversion via the upper part of the ED pathway were 
strongly downregulated. Among those highly upregu
-
lated in the presence of 3-HP were two genes encoding 
Page 12 of 16Arenas‑López et al. Biotechnol Biofuels          (2019) 12:150 
isoenzymes of isocitrate lyase (aceA1, H16_A2211 and 
aceA2, H16_A2227). The same genes were previously 
shown to be upregulated during growth on trioleate [7], 
the fatty acid components of which are metabolised via 
β-oxidation and, like acetate, enter the tricarboxylic acid 
cycle via acetyl-CoA. In the absence of other significant 
anaplerotic fluxes into the TCA, net assimilation of car
-
bon is facilitated by the glyoxylate shunt, a pathway that 
circumvents the decarboxylation reactions of the TCA 
cycle [7, 54], with isocitrate lyase catalysing the first reac
-
tion of said pathway. Hence, increased expression of the 
isocitrate lyase genes is in accordance with the proposed 
oxidative 3-HP assimilation pathway which yields acetyl-
CoA. The aceB1 gene encoding malate synthase, the 
second enzyme of the glyoxylate bypass, was not upregu
-
lated, in contrast to what had been reported for growth 
on trioleate [7]. However, AceB1 only accounts for part 
of the cell’s malate synthase activity and the presence of 
a second as yet unidentified enzyme has thus been pro
-
posed [54].
Conclusions
This study engineered a C. necator strain unable to con -
sume 3-HP under all conditions tested and elucidated 
the primary roles of the three different mmsA  operons 
present in the organism. These roles are linked to the 
degradation of β-alanine, 3-HP and valine, respectively. 
Nevertheless, inactivation of all three methylmalonate 
semialdehyde dehydrogenases was required to com
-
pletely abolish 3-HP breakdown. The generated CNCA13 
strain, C. necator H16 ΔmmsA2ΔmmsA1ΔmmsA3, is an 
ideal chassis for the future biosynthesis of 3-HP .

Cell cultivation and sampling for transcriptome analyses
Three single colonies of C. necator H16 grown on solid LB 
medium were spread on solid minimal media containing 
fructose (25 mM). Inoculated minimal media plates were 
incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. From these plates, precul

tures were prepared in 50 mL PE tubes containing 10 mL 
MM with either fructose (25  mM) or 3-HP (50  mM). 
Single C. necator colonies were used for inoculation and 
precultures were incubated at 30  °C and 180  rpm in a 
shaking incubator. Precultures with fructose as sole car

bon source were incubated for 1 day, whereas precultures 
with 3-HP were incubated for 2 days. Main cultures were 
performed in triplicate in 25 mL of the same medium in 
250 mL baffled shake flasks and were inoculated from the 
respective precultures to a starting  OD
600 of 0.025. Flasks 
were incubated at 30 °C and 180 rpm in a shaking incu -
bator and growth was monitored by measuring optical 
density at 600 nm. Samples for RNA isolation were taken 
during late exponential growth  (OD
600 ~ 2) by rapid cen -
trifugation (~ 30 s, max. speed) in 1.5 mL reaction tubes 
and quenching of cell pellets in liquid nitrogen. Pellets 
were stored at − 80 °C prior to RNA isolation.
RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis via RNA‑seq
Cell pellets were disrupted using the FastRNA PRO BLUE 
KIT (MP Biomedicals). On ice, two cell pellets of each 
culture were resuspended in 500  µL of RNApro
™ solu -
tion (containing Trizol) and combined in a single 2  mL 
screw-cap tube with Lysing Matrix B. Cell pellets were 
disrupted in a tissue homogeniser (Precellys 24, Peglab) 
at 6000  rpm for 40  s. After centrifugation at 12,000×g 
the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentri
-
fuge tube and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, 
before RNA was extracted from the lysate using a Direct
-
Zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research), according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. After elution of RNA in a total 
volume of 50  µL RNAse-free water, the samples were 
treated with 2.6 U of Ambion TURBO DNAse in a total 
reaction volume of 60  µL for 1  h at room temperature. 
The RNA was purified again using the Clean & Concen
-
trator kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufac -
turer instructions. The absence of DNA in the total RNA 
preparation was confirmed by PCR using two individual 
primer pairs (DNA_Cn1/2, Additional file  11: Table  S4) 
and genomic C. necator H16 DNA as a positive control.
The depletion of rRNA, cDNA library preparation and 
sequencing were done as described in Wittchen et  al. 
[61]. However, in this case equal RNA amounts from 
the three replicates of each condition were pooled, and 
2  µg RNA of each pool were used for the creation of a 
single whole transcriptome cDNA library. The resulting 
paired-end reads from the sequencing of the two librar
-
ies from C. necator grown with fructose and 3-HP as sole 
carbon sources were trimmed for low quality bases from 
both ends using Trimmomatic v0.35 [62] and mapped 
to the reference genome (NC008313.1, NC008314.1, 
NC005241.1) using bowtie2 v2.2.7 [63] with default set
-
tings for paired-end read mapping. The resulting SAM 
files were converted to BAM files using SAMtools [64]. 
ReadXplorer v.2.2.3 was used for visualisation and fur
-
ther analysis [32, 33]. For differential gene expression 
analysis the inbuilt DESeq algorithm [34] was applied 
with default settings (cutoffs for which genes were con
-
sidered as differentially transcribed). The adjusted p value 
(p
adj) calculated by the DESeq algorithm using Benja -
mini–Hochberg correction was accepted as a measure of 
significance. The full data has been deposited at ArrayEx
-
press (https ://www.ebi.ac.uk/array expre ss/) and is acces-
sible under accession number E-MTAB-7701.

sis. Diluent solution was prepared using mobile phase 
(0.005 M  H

(Sigma-Aldrich) acting as an internal standard. Also, 
an appropriate linear range of standard solutions using 
3-HP (Apollo Scientific) covering the range of concentra

tions expected was prepared in the medium used for the 
corresponding experiment. All standards, samples and 
blanks were passed through 0.2  µm syringe filters, and

150 µL of the filtered solution mixed with 150 µL of dilu -
ent solution, vortexed thoroughly and added into HPLC 
vials containing inserts and closed with split caps. Sam -
ples were run at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min −1 at 35 °C in 
0.005 M  H2SO4 mobile phase for 30 min on the Dionex 
UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific) 
using a Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H + (8%) 150  mm 
× 4.6  mm × 8  µm column (Phenomenex) and a Diode 
Array detector (UV–VIS 210 nm). An Aminex HPX-87H 
300 mm × 7.8 mm × 9 µm column (Bio-Rad) was used 
when a better separation of peaks was needed and sam
-
ples were run for 55 min.
Sequence databases and BLAST analysis
The databases at the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) were used to identify and access 
nucleotide sequences and peptide sequences of genes 
of interest [65]. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) was used to access potential pathways 
and annotated genes [31]. BLAST software, available on 
the NCBI website, was used to analyse sequences and 
identification of similarity. Nucleotide BLAST (blastn) 
optimised for highly similar sequences (megablast) was 
used to identify similar or identical DNA sequences; 
blastp (protein–protein blast) was used to identify puta
-
tive protein homologs.
