Abstract
There has been recent interest in creating an efﬁcient microbial production route
for 3-hydroxypropionic acid, an important platform chemical. We develop and
solve a mathematical model for the time-dependent metabolite concentrations in the
malonyl-CoA pathway for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production in microbes, using
a combination of numerical and asymptotic methods. This allows us to identify the
most important targets for enzyme regulation therein under conditions of plentiful and
sparse pyruvate, and to quantify their relative importance. In our model, we account
for sinks of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to, for example, the citric acid cycle and
fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively. Notably, in the plentiful pyruvate case we deter-
mine that there is a bifurcation in the asymptotic structure of the system, the crossing
of which corresponds to a signiﬁcant increase in 3-hydroxypropionic acid production.
Moreover, we deduce that the most signiﬁcant increases to 3-hydroxypropionic acid
production can be obtained by up-regulating two speciﬁc enzymes in tandem, as the
inherent nonlinearity of the system means that a solo up-regulation of either does not
result in large increases in production. The types of issue arising here are prevalent in
synthetic biology applications, and it is hoped that the system considered provides an
instructive exemplar for broader applications.

1 Introduction
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a platform chemical which can be converted into
several valuable chemicals, for example acrylic acid and acrylamide (Werpy et al.
2004). There has been signiﬁcant recent interest in introducing metabolic pathways to
microorganisms in order to produce 3HP at industrially viable levels (Borodina et al.
2015; Chen et al. 2014, 2017; Kim et al. 2014; Son et al. 2017; Matsakas et al. 2018).
The manipulation of metabolic pathways in microorganisms is an exciting avenue
of research arising in synthetic biology. As enzyme production within an organism
is genetically controlled, introducing speciﬁc genes allows an organism to produce
chemicals that it could not previously. One of the most successful examples of a chem-
ical synthesized by this procedure is amorpha-4,11-diene (a precursor to artemisinin,
an antimalarial) from Escherichia coli (Martin et al. 2003). It can be expensive and
time-consuming to introduce a new chemical pathway to a microorganism and opti-
mize the production of a given metabolite. Moreover, adding and blocking pathways
can have unintended consequences for the metabolism of the microorganism, and the
experimental parameter space is extensive. Mathematical modelling allows system-
atic progress to be made in understanding a pathway and can signiﬁcantly reduce the
experimental parameter space that needs to be searched.
In Kumar et al. ( 2013), three thermodynamically feasible pathways from pyruvate
to 3HP are suggested. In previous work, we investigated 3HP production via the
β-alanine route using mathematical modelling (Dalwadi et al. 2017). Here, we are
interested in mathematically modelling 3HP production via the malonyl coenzyme
A (malonyl-CoA) route, with the aim of determining the most appropriate enzyme
targets for regulation. We consider the reactions

where ( 1f) and ( 1g) represent the loss of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to other
metabolic pathways, such as the citric acid cycle or fatty acid biosynthesis. We do
not track any metabolites once they reach the sink. We show a schematic representa-
tion of this pathway in Fig. 1.
Our general aim is to determine how the system behaves as a function of its param-
eters, with our main goal being to understand how to maximize 3HP production while
minimizing the levels of malonic semialdehyde, a toxic intermediate, where possible.

Fig. 1 A schematic network diagram for the metabolic pathway we consider in this paper, from pyruvate to
3HP via malonyl-CoA. The arrows denote the direction of the reactions and are labelled by their respective
catalytic constants (also referred to as turnover numbers). We only track the metabolites included in this
ﬁgure and, speciﬁcally, not any involved in the acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA sinks. The subscript for a given
enzyme E
i (for i = 1,..., 5) corresponds to the subscript of the related maximal reaction rate. The exception
here is for the reversible reaction between malonic semialdehyde and 3HP , where both reactions use the
enzyme E
4. Hence, E1 corresponds to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.1, EC 2.3.1.12, and
EC 1.8.1.4), E2 corresponds to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2), E3 corresponds to malonyl-CoA
reductase (EC 1.2.1.75), E4 corresponds to 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.298), and E5
corresponds to malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating) (EC 1.2.1.18)
To derive and solve our mathematical model, we make several modelling assumptions.
We consider a system that is well mixed and thus spatially independent. This means
that we are able to formulate a mathematical system in terms of ordinary differential
equations in time, rather than partial differential equations in time and space. These
differential equations require initial conditions, and we consider the case where pyru-
vate is instantaneously introduced to a system containing all of the relevant enzymes,
but none of the intermediate metabolites. This assumption facilitates a mathematical
analysis by reducing the number of unknown parameters in the system. Moreover,
we follow the approach of Dalwadi et al. ( 2017) and Dalwadi et al. ( 2018) and inves-
tigate two simpliﬁed cases of pyruvate replenishment, which model the extremes of
the actual time-dependent pyruvate replenishment. The ﬁrst of these is continuous
pyruvate replenishment, where the pyruvate is held at a constant concentration, which
could represent a continuous culture, and the second is no pyruvate replenishment
which could represent a batch culture. Understanding these extreme cases allows us to
determine the key targets for enzyme regulation. Finally, we assume that the formation
rate of enzyme complex production is much quicker than the rate of substrate con-
sumption, and thus, the reaction rates are governed by Michaelis–Menten-type laws,
the speciﬁc form of which we obtain from the literature.
To analyse the nonlinear governing equations that we derive, we use a combination
of numerical and asymptotic methods. The latter enhances our physical insight into
the underlying system and allows us to derive closed-form expressions for how the
123
36 Page 4 of 31 M. P. Dalwadi, J. R. King
metabolite concentrations vary as functions of the experimental parameters. Asymp-
totic techniques (see, for example, Holmes 2012; Kevorkian and Cole 2013)a l l o wu st o
largely bypass the issue of uncertainty in the parameters, as deriving analytic approx-
imations of the dynamic metabolite concentrations only requires an understanding of
the relative order of magnitude of each experimental parameter. Moreover, the non-
linear nature of the system means that a broad understanding of the system behaviour
cannot be obtained by simply varying one parameter at a time and collecting system
outputs, so asymptotic solutions allow for a quicker and more comprehensive under-
standing of the system. We note that there is a bifurcation in the asymptotic structure
of the system for the case of continuous pyruvate replenishment, and we investigate
this in terms of our goal of maximizing 3HP production.
In Sect. 2, we introduce a mathematical model to describe the reaction kinetics.
We solve this system numerically and asymptotically, in Sect. 3 for the case with a
continuous replenishment of pyruvate, and in Sect. 4 for the case with no replenishment
of pyruvate. Finally, in Sect. 5 we discuss our results.
2 Model Description
The method we use to set up our governing equations is similar to that of Dalwadi
et al. ( 2018), but for a different metabolic network. Thus, to describe the dynam-
ics of the network from pyruvate to 3HP , shown in Fig. 1, we obtain corresponding
Michaelis–Menten-type reaction velocities from the literature. The resulting dimen-
sional governing system is

where each variable is deﬁned in Table 1. We will consider two extreme cases of sys-
tem ( 2), corresponding to continuous and no replenishment of pyruvate, respectively,
noting that the reality will lie somewhere between these two extremes. In ( 2), most of
the reaction velocity terms are in standard Michaelis–Menten form, and we obtain the
kinetic parameters for these reaction velocities from the corresponding references in
Table2. A lower-case k represents a catalytic constant, and an upper-case K represents
a Michaelis (or Michaelis-type) constant. We include a modiﬁed Michaelis–Menten
term for reaction ( 1a), which encompasses the uncompetitive inhibitory effect that

acetyl-CoA has with pyruvate (Kresze and Ronft 1981a). Therefore, we use the stan-
dard form for uncompetitive inhibition for this reaction velocity (Y ung-Chi and Prusoff
1973). Reactions ( 1f) and ( 1g) correspond to the aggregated loss of acetyl-CoA and
malonyl-CoA, respectively, to other metabolic pathways present in the microorganism,
such as the citric acid cycle or fatty acid biosynthesis. We model each of these aggre-
gated losses as a sink with ﬁrst-order reaction kinetics, using the parameters A and B
to represent the strength of each sink for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, respectively.
To get around the issue that these parameters are unknown, we will later consider a
distinguished asymptotic limit (in a sense to be made formal later) where both of these
sink reactions balance the other reactions. The parameters E
i , where i = 1,..., 5,
denote the initial enzyme concentrations for the reactions they control, noting that the
reversible reaction with maximal reaction rates k
4 and k−4 are both controlled by E4.
The initial levels of each metabolite present in the system are relatively unknown.
Thus, we make a modelling choice to reduce the number of uncertain parameters in
the system to facilitate a simpliﬁed analysis of the system. We use initial conditions
corresponding to the case in which pyruvate is instantaneously introduced to a system
containing all of the relevant enzymes, but none of the intermediate metabolites. That
is, we use [S
1](0) = S0, where S0 represents the prescribed initial or typical level of
pyruvate present in the system, with none of remaining metabolites initially present:
[S2](0) =[ S3](0) =[ S4](0) =[ P](0) = 0.
We now nondimensionalize the system and exploit various small dimensionless
parameter ratios to introduce a small parameter into the system, thus allowing us to
write the system in terms of O(1) constants and one small parameter to quantify the
relative size of each term. This is useful because kinetic parameters can vary between
different environments, as shown in Table 2. To side-step the issues associated with this
parameter uncertainty, we seek to quantitatively understand how the system behaves
as these parameters vary by interrogating the system using an asymptotic analysis
(see, for example, Holmes 2012; Kevorkian and Cole 2013).
We provide our nondimensional variable scalings in Table 1. Essentially, we scale
each dimensional metabolite concentration with S0, the initial concentration of pyru-
vate, and we scale time with S0/(k1 E1), the characteristic time of the ﬁrst reaction,
which occurs between pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. To form the dimensionless parameters
in the system, we ﬁrst scale each rate constant with the rate constant of the ﬁrst reac-
tion, each Michaelis constant with the initial pyruvate concentration, and each enzyme

To give an idea of the range of these parameter values, we provide data from several organisms. As we use an asymptotic analysis, it is the relative magni tude of these values,
rather than their exact values, which are important. As discussed in the main text, we use the value S0 = 2 mM, assume that Ei /E1 = 0.1f o r i ∈{ 2,... 5}, and we scale
extreme parameter ratios with the small dimensionless parameter ϵ, deﬁned as the ratio of K i
1 and S0. As there is a distinguished asymptotic limit when ¯A = O(ϵ) and
¯B = O(1/ϵ), we use these scalings in our asymptotic analysis, choosing ¯A = ϵ and ¯B = 1/ϵ in our simulations
123

concentration with the concentration of the ﬁrst enzyme. Then, using the typical dimen-
sional values in Table 2, we note that the parameter ratio ϵ := K i
1/S0 = 7 × 10−3
is very small. Hence, we scale the other extreme parameter ratios in our system with
the small dimensionless parameter ϵ, allowing us to write each additional dimension-
less parameter as cϵ j , where c is an O(1) parameter (in practice, we take this to be
between ϵ1/2 and ϵ−1/2), and j is an integer. This allows us to quantify the “small-
ness” of each parameter while allowing each parameter c to vary over approximately
three orders of magnitude, yielding a system in terms of a small parameter. We take
the typical concentration of pyruvate within a microorganism to be S0 = 2 mM, and
we assume that Ei /E1 = 0.1f o r i ∈{ 2,... 5}. We make this assumption since we
expect the levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), corresponding to E1,t o
be more abundant than the other enzymes in this pathway since PDC is fundamental
to cellular respiration in that it links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. However, we
emphasize that different values of E
i can be considered if required by varying the
appropriate dimensionless parameter. The resultant dimensionless parameters we use
in our system are given in Table 2.

where ϵ is a small parameter. The dimensionless initial conditions are: S1(0) = 1,
S2(0) = 0, S3(0) = 0, S4(0) = 0, and P(0) = 0.
We emphasize that the asymptotic sizes of ¯A and ¯B are not currently set, and that
we have not yet scaled our dependent variables with ϵ. As we are not able to accurately
estimate the typical sizes of ¯A and ¯B, we instead consider the distinguished asymptotic
limit in which they balance the core reaction velocities over the same timescale: from
pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, from malonyl-CoA to
malonic semialdehyde, and from malonic semialdehyde to 3HP . The reaction velocity
from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA has asymptotic size O(min(1, S
1,ϵ/ S2)). The reaction
velocity from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA has asymptotic size O(min(ϵ, S2)).B a l -
ancing these two reaction velocities, and noting that we start with S1 = O(1),w e
may deduce that the size of these reaction velocities must be of O(ϵ), and hence
we obtain the scaling S2 = O(1). For these reaction velocities to balance with ¯AS2,
we must consider the distinguished limit ¯A = O(ϵ). Balancing these terms with the
123
An Asymptotic Analysis of the Malonyl-CoA Route to... Page 9 of 31 36
reaction velocity from malonyl-CoA to malonic semialdehyde, with asymptotic size
O(min(1, S3/ϵ)), we obtain the scaling S3 = O(ϵ2). Then, the balance with ¯BS3
yields the distinguished limit ¯B = O(1/ϵ). Therefore, we use the scalings ¯A = ϵ ˆA
and ¯B = ˆB/ϵ, where ˆA, ˆB = O(1). This appears to be the only distinguished limit of
interest.
We now solve this system for two different cases of pyruvate replenishment. The ﬁrst
is continuous pyruvate replenishment, where the pyruvate dynamics are not governed
by ( 3a), and instead we impose S1(t) ≡ 1. The second is no pyruvate replenishment,
and ( 3a) does hold. We will deduce that the two systems are equivalent for t = O(1),
and only diverge when t = O(1/ϵ). In both cases, we are interested in determining
how to maximize 3HP production. For the continuous-replenishment case, we are
also interested in trying to minimize the long-time levels of malonic semialdehyde,
a toxic intermediate compound, present in the cell over a long timescale. As the no-
replenishment-of-pyruvate case eventually tends to no metabolites in the system, the
long-time levels of malonic semialdehyde in that case are trivial. We now consider the
continuous-pyruvate-replenishment case.
3 Continuous Replenishment of Pyruvate
We ﬁrst consider the case where the pyruvate is continuously replenished, modelling
the bacteria being harvested in a continuous culture. A numerical simulation of system
(3b–e) with S1(t) ≡ 1 shows that the 3HP concentration is bounded above as t →∞
(Fig. 2). For our goal of maximizing 3HP production, we would like to understand how
to improve the 3HP production by regulating the enzymes in the system. In this section,
we solve the nonlinear system ( 3b–e) with S1(t) ≡ 1 through an asymptotic analysis,
exploiting the small parameter ϵ. Our analysis reveals that there is a bifurcation in the
asymptotic structure for the large-time behaviour of 3HP with important implications
for 3HP production. Our results allow us to quantify this bifurcation in terms of the
system parameters, providing physical insight and suggesting which reactions should
be the key targets for genetic manipulation.
3.1 Asymptotic Structure
We now discuss the asymptotic structure of the continuous-replenishment case, with
reference to the metabolic network shown in Fig. 1. In this case, there are two important
timescales in the system: early time, where t = O(ϵ), and late time, where t = O(1/ϵ).
Over the early timescale, the levels of malonyl-CoA and malonic semialdehyde reach
a steady and quasi-steady state, respectively. The remaining metabolite concentrations
increase through this early timescale, with a change in the power law governing their
growth. Over the late timescale, the levels of acetyl-CoA reach a steady state, but the
behaviour of the 3HP depends on the system parameters. There is a bifurcation in
the asymptotic structure for the large-time behaviour of 3HP , the levels of which are
bounded above unless some critical parameter ratio is reached. We investigate this
bifurcation when we consider the late-time behaviour.

grey lines are the numerical solutions from system ( 3b–e) with S1 ≡ 1, the dashed blue lines are the
early-time asymptotic results from ( 6), and the dotted black lines are the late-time results, where we use
the asymptotic results ( 11), ( 12), and ( 15)f o r S3, S4,a n d P, respectively. These asymptotic results yield
a single reduced ODE for S2, given in ( 9), and it is the numerical solution to this that we plot for S2 as a
dotted black line. We use the parameter values given in Table 2 (Color ﬁgure online)
3.2 Early Time: t = O(/SI)
We start our analysis over the distinguished timescale t = O(ϵ), and thus, we make
the scaling t = ϵ ˆt. By balancing reaction velocities, we ﬁnd that the appropri-
ate scalings for the dependent variables over this timescale are (S2, S3, S4, P) =
(ϵ ˆS2,ϵ 2 ˆS3,ϵ 2 ˆS4,ϵ 2 ˆP), which converts system ( 3b–e) into

We see that the early-time results ( 6) (dashed black lines) agree very well with the
numerical results (solid grey lines) when t = O(ϵ) = O(10−2) in Fig. 2. However, the
metabolite concentrations stray from these asymptotic results (with the exception of
ˆS3)a s t becomes larger than of O(ϵ). This is because new terms in the system become
of leading order, and so we must explore a new asymptotic region to understand the
system fully. We investigate this in the next section. As such, it is helpful to state the
large-ˆt limits of solutions ( 6), as these will allow us to match appropriately into the
next timescale. In this limit, we obtain the following expressions

and hence we see that ˆS3 and ˆS4 reach a steady state over t = O(ϵ), while ˆS2 and
ˆP continue to grow over the same timescale. In the next subsection, we consider the
remaining important timescale t = O(1/ϵ).
3.3 Late Time: t = O(1//SI)
The second and ﬁnal distinguished timescale for continuous replenishment is t =
O(1/ϵ),s ow en o wu s et h es c a l i n g t = T /ϵ. This is the timescale over which there
is a balance between the source from pyruvate and the sinks from acetyl-CoA and
malonyl-CoA. Over this timescale, S2 and P are both of O(1), and the scalings for the
remaining metabolites are still (S3, S4) = (ϵ2 ˆS3,ϵ 2 ˆS4), which follow from ( 7), the
large-time limits of the early-time solutions. Using the scalings mentioned above, we
obtain the late-time version of ( 3b–e):

From ( 9c), we can immediately deduce that ˜S3 is constant over this timescale. That
is, over the late timescale, ˜S3 takes the constant value
˜S3 =

The asymptotic late-time results ( 11), ( 12), and ( 15) (dotted black lines) agree well
with the numerical results (solid grey lines) when t = O(1/ϵ) = O(102) in Fig. 2.T h e
remaining nonlinear differential equation ( 9a) decouples from the rest of the system,
and solving this equation is not required to understand the dynamics of the rest of the
system. However, we note that the remaining equation will be important when there
is no replenishment of pyruvate, which we consider in the next section. To understand
the dynamics of S
2,( 9a) must be solved numerically, and the solution to this agrees
well with the full numerical solution of S2 in Fig. 2.
Given that the argument of the logarithm in ( 15) will vanish for some positive value
of P if and only if ¯k4 < ¯k∗, we may deduce that the large-time behaviour of P has
a critical dependence on the sign of ¯k4 − ¯k∗. Thus, ¯k∗ is the bifurcation point for the
parameter ¯k4, in terms of changing the asymptotic structure of the solution. Speciﬁ-
cally, when ¯k4 < ¯k∗, corresponding to a weak reaction from malonic semialdehyde to
3HP , we obtain the bounded large-time behaviour

crosses denote numerical results (solving ( 3b–e) with S1 ≡ 1). The subcritical and supercritical regimes are
to the left and right, respectively, of the dashed lines in each subﬁgure. To obtain the large-time numerical
limits, we run the simulations until t = tend := 1012; we approximate lim t→∞ d P/dt ≈ P(tend)/tend and
limt→∞ S4 ≈ S4(tend). Apart from ¯k4, which we vary in this ﬁgure, we use the parameter values given in
Table 2, and these correspond to an asymptotic value of the critical parameter ¯k∗ ≈ 1.3951
however when ¯k4 > ¯k∗, corresponding to a strong reaction from malonic semialdehyde
to 3HP , we obtain the unbounded large-time behaviour

We show this bifurcation behaviour in Fig. 3a, including a comparison between the
numerical and asymptotic results. We see that our numerical results show the bifurca-
tion behaviour predicted by our asymptotic results. Moreover, our asymptotic results
are good predictions of both the location of the bifurcation and the long-time behaviour.
It is of mathematical interest to brieﬂy note that when ¯k4 = ¯k∗, the solution to ( 13)
is
P = ¯K M

as T →∞ . (17)
Hence, as ¯k4 passes through the bifurcation point, the long-time behaviour of P is to
increase with the square root of time.
From ( 12), we see that ˜S4 will tend to a constant in the far-ﬁeld; for ¯k4 < ¯k∗,w e

˜S4 → 1
¯v4 +¯v5

¯v3 + ˆB
+ ¯k−4
)
as T →∞ . (18b)
We show this bifurcating behaviour in Fig. 3b, including a comparison between the
numerical and asymptotic results. As before, we see that our numerical results display
the bifurcation behaviour predicted by our asymptotic results, and that the latter are a
good predictor of the bifurcation behaviour. Recall that our goal for the continuous-
pyruvate-replenishment case is to maximize 3HP production while minimizing the
large-time levels of malonic semialdehyde, the latter being a toxic intermediate com-
pound. Therefore, as large-time 3HP production is zero and malonic semialdehyde
levels are higher in the subcritical regime, Fig. 3b tells us immediately that the sub-
critical regime is a bad regime for industrially viable 3HP production, and that the
parameter regime ¯k
4 > ¯k∗ is much better for our goal. From Table 2, we note that the
critical parameter ¯k∗ ≈ 1.3951, but ¯k4 = 0.67. Therefore, the simulations in Fig. 2
occur in the subcritical regime, as can be deduced by noting that the 3HP concentra-
tion is bounded above. Our model predicts that one can achieve large gains in 3HP
production if one is able to move into the supercritical regime.
3.4 Physical Implications
To frame our discussion around parameters that can be varied experimentally (essen-
tially the levels of each enzyme, regulated by the over- or under-expression of the
genes that control their production), we rewrite our results in terms of dimensional
quantities. In dimensional terms, the bifurcation occurs when k
4 = k∗, where
k∗ = k−4k5 K M
4 E5
k2 K M
5 E2
(
1 + BK M
3
k3 E3
)
. (19)
From ( 19), we see that an up-regulation of E2 and a down-regulation of E5 have
the most signiﬁcant effect on lowering k∗, the critical bifurcation parameter, and
thus hopefully moving into the supercritical regime for signiﬁcantly increased 3HP
production. Additionally, an up-regulation of E3 will also have an effect in lowering
k∗, but with diminishing returns. Notably, our model suggests that regulation of neither
E1 nor E4 has a signiﬁcant effect on this critical bifurcation parameter (see below for
a potential important role for E4, however).
The supercritical regime occurs when k4 > k∗, and this corresponds to a nonzero
large-time production of 3HP , which is the target if we are to attain the goal of indus-
trially viable 3HP production. In this case, the dimensional large-time production of
3HP is
d[P]

123

and the dimensional large-time levels of malonic semialdehyde in the system are

)(

k4 K M

) . (21)
As our goal for the continuous-replenishment case is to maximize 3HP production
while minimizing the large-time levels of malonic semialdehyde, we consider the
ratio of the large-time levels of d [P]/dτ to [S4], to obtain
d[P]

While ( 22) appears to have a convoluted form, it provides a quantitative value that we
wish to maximize. In particular, we are able to see that the most signiﬁcant gains can
be made by up-regulating E2 and E4 in tandem. Our model suggests that an increase
in only one of these enzymes will increase ratio ( 22), but with diminishing returns
(Fig. 4). However, increasing both enzymes will result in signiﬁcant increases in the
3HP production to malonic semialdehyde ratio (Fig. 4). Additionally, we note that
3HP production can also be increased by up-regulating E3 and down-regulating E5,
though this will have diminishing returns. We emphasize that maximizing ( 22) should
not be considered a deﬁnitive metric, since the toxic effect of malonic semialdehyde
([S4]) will have its own nonlinear effects for which to account. Other relevant metrics
could involve keeping the maximum value of malonic semialdehyde below a critical
value or keeping the cumulative presence of malonic semialdehyde low. Our multiscale
approach allows for the efﬁcient analysis of any such metric.
4 No Replenishment of Pyruvate
We now consider the case where the pyruvate is never replenished. Due to the con-
nectivity of the metabolic network and the sinks in the system, this problem results
in a long-term decay of each metabolite. As the only metabolite initially present in
the system is pyruvate, the remaining metabolites will each reach a maximum level at
some (generally different) point in time. Our main goal in this subsection is to obtain
an asymptotic expression for the maximum level of 3HP present in the system, and
the time at which this occurs. In a batch culture system, where nothing is added or
removed to the system until the run is stopped for harvesting, this time provides an
approximation for when to stop the run and harvest the product. We will summarize
the system that governs this optimal time and product yield, but we relegate the details
to “Appendix A” for brevity.

Fig. 4 The effect of regulating enzymes in the pathway shown in Fig. 1 on the key ratio ( 22), obtained
by solving ( 3b–e) with S1 ≡ 1. We use the parameter values in Table 2, but with increased enzyme
concentrations as speciﬁed on the x-axis. While up-regulating E2 yields improvement, this has diminishing
returns. However, even though up-regulating E4 by itself does not appear to have a signiﬁcant effect on the
ratio, up-regulating E2 and E4 in tandem does have a signiﬁcant effect (Color ﬁgure online)
4.1 Asymptotic Structure
We now discuss the asymptotic structure of the no-replenishment case, with reference
to the metabolic network shown in Fig. 1. The no-replenishment-of-pyruvate case is
equivalent to the continuous-replenishment case at leading order until we reach the
timescale t = O(1/ϵ) (as shown in Fig. 5 for S2, S3, S4, and P), at which point the
depletion of pyruvate occurs as a leading-order effect.
Over this longer timescale, the rest of the system remains unchanged until the levels
of pyruvate are of O(ϵ), which we deﬁne to occur at t = Td /ϵ = O(1/ϵ).T h ep y r u v a t e
is then depleted to a negligible level at a relatively quicker rate, over a timescale of
t − Td /ϵ = O(1), as can be seen in Fig. 6, while the remaining metabolites are
unchanged at leading order. After this rapid depletion of pyruvate, the reaction from
pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is negligible and so the levels of acetyl-CoA start to deplete,
again over the timescale of t = O(1/ϵ). When the levels of acetyl-CoA become
of O(ϵ), which we deﬁne to occur at t = T ∗/ϵ = O(1/ϵ), the Michaelis–Menten
reaction from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA becomes unsaturated, and the lower levels
of acetyl-CoA are felt through the rest of the system. After this point, all the remaining
metabolites start to deplete over a timescale of t = O(1/ϵ), and so t = T
∗/ϵ marks
the time at which the level of 3HP in the system is maximal. In the next section, we
present the reduced system required to be solved to determine T ∗.

system (3b–e) with S
1 ≡ 1, and the dashed blue lines are the numerical solutions from the no-replenishment-
of-pyruvate system ( 3). We see that the two cases are essentially equivalent until around t = 5, after which
the metabolite levels drop in a sharp manner for S2, S3,a n d S4, and at a slower rate for P. The maximal
level of 3HP occurs around the time of the sharp drop. We use the parameter values given in Table 2 for
these ﬁgures (Color ﬁgure online)
4.2 Reduced System for T∗
The time at which the level of 3HP in the system is maximal is given by t = T ∗/ϵ +
O(1), where T ∗ = O(1). To determine T ∗ at leading order, it sufﬁces to solve the
reduced system
dS2
dT = f (S2) − ¯k2 +¯v5 ˆS4(T ) − ˆAS2(T )
for 0 < T < T ∗, with S2 ∼ (2T )1/2 as T → 0+, (23a)
and we provide a derivation of this reduced system in “Appendix A”. In ( 23a), the
nonlinear function f is given by

Fig. 6 The dynamics of pyruvate ( S1) when it is never replenished, obtained from solving ( 3). We see that
it becomes exponentially small shortly after t = 12. We use the parameter values given in Table 2
f (S2) =

⎨
⎩

if 0 < T < Td ,
0i f Td < T < T ∗.
(23b)
Additionally, since the remaining metabolite concentrations are equivalent to those in
the continuous-replenishment case until acetyl-CoA depletion occurs, the concentra-
tion of malonic semialdehyde ˆS
4 is given by the implicit representation ( 12), (14)–(15).
As shown in “Appendix A”, the asymptotic leading-order time at which pyruvate
depletion occurs is T = Td , where Td satisﬁes the implicit equation
∫ Td
0
f (S2(s))ds = 1. (23c)
The time at which there is a maximal amount of 3HP in the system T = T ∗ is
when acetyl-CoA depletion occurs, since this is when the remaining metabolites in
the system start to feel the lack of the previous metabolites. Asymptotically, this occurs
when S2(T ∗) = 0 or, equivalently, for T ∗ satisfying the implicit equation

which is obtained by integrating ( 23a) in time and using ( 23c). It is a simple task to
solve this system numerically for any speciﬁed parameter values. Then, the maximal
amount of 3HP in the system can be obtained by substituting T ∗ into ( 15) to yield the
implicit equation

Sect. 4.2. Our solutions for the reduced system are valid for 0 < t < T ∗/ϵ. Here, t = T ∗/ϵ is the asymptotic
result for the point at which the 3HP in the system is maximal, and P(T ∗) in ( 24) gives the asymptotic
result for the maximal level of 3HP . We mark the maximal value of 3HP in the system with a cross in the
appropriate colour for the numerical and asymptotic solutions, respectively. We use the parameter values
given in Table 2 (Color ﬁgure online)

(24)
Comparing this reduced system to the full system in Fig. 7, we see that the maximal
3HP produced is very similar between the asymptotic and numerical results, and
that there is an O(1) difference in the predicted time at which this maximal 3HP is
produced between the two, as predicted by the error in our asymptotic results. We
show this excellent agreement for a range of relative concentrations of E
5 (Fig. 8), the
enzyme which recycles malonic semialdehyde back into acetyl-CoA. Moreover, we
see that more 3HP is produced when E5 is down-regulated.
An alternative implicit equation for T ∗ is given by ( 45), which uses the analytic
solution for S2 when Td < T < T ∗, stated in ( 44).
4.3 Asymptotic Expression for T∗ when ¯v5 → 0
Our model predicts that 3HP production can be improved by under-expressing the
enzyme that controls the reaction from malonic semialdehyde to acetyl-CoA, which
has maximal reaction rate ¯k5 (Fig. 8). If this reaction is completely removed from the
metabolic network, we are able to provide an analytic expression for T ∗ and P(T ∗).
This corresponds to taking the limit ¯k5 → 0, equivalent to ¯v5 → 0. In this limit, there
is no further production or depletion of 3HP when t > T ∗/ϵ, and the total amount of
3HP produced is given by P(T ∗).
As ¯v5 → 0, there are several scalings that reduce the parameter dependence of the
system. We scale T = ¯T / ˆA and S2(T ) = ¯k2Y ( ¯T )/ ˆA,t ot u r n( 23a)i n t o

When ¯Td < ¯T < ¯T ∗,s y s t e m(25a) is solved explicitly by
Y ( ¯T ) =
(
1 + Y ( ¯Td )
)
e ¯Td − ¯T − 1, (29a)
and as ¯T ∗ satisﬁes Y ( ¯T ∗) = 0, we can state ¯T ∗ in terms of ¯Td as follows:
¯T ∗ = ¯Td + log
(
1 + Y ( ¯Td )
)
, (30)
where each term in ( 30) can be determined explicitly from ( 28).
As we provide the general implicit result for maximal 3HP in ( 24), we can derive a
reduced version for the limit we consider in this subsection by taking the same limit,
¯v5 → 0, noting that ¯k∗ also scales with ¯v5.U s i n g(30), the reduced result for the time
at which the levels of 3HP are maximal, the total amount of 3HP produced is given
explicitly by

To visualize (31), we provide a plot of F(α, β)in Fig. 9, but as a function of αβ2 = ˆA/4
and β = ¯k2/2, as these are proxies for the strength of the sink and source in the system,
respectively. As F is bounded above by 1 and this limit is attained as α → 0, decreasing
α (and hence ˆA) to zero will have a more signiﬁcant effect than any ﬁnite increase in
β (and hence ¯k2), as long as the organism is able to survive with low values of ˆA.
4.3.1 Physical Implications
In a similar manner to the analysis in Sect. 3.4, we now discuss the physical implica-
tions of our results from this subsection and we reintroduce dimensional variables to
our key results.

Fig. 10 A plot showing F(ˆα, ˆβ), the asymptotic result for the total 3HP produced with no replenishment of
pyruvate in the limit of ¯v5 → 0, given in ( 31). In contrast to Fig. 9,w ep r e s e n tF in terms of a variation in
the parameters E1 and E2 (as shown in ( 35)), corresponding to regulation of enzymes (Color ﬁgure online)
as proxies for E1 and E2, we see that up-regulating E2 results in higher levels of 3HP ,
whereas up-regulating E1 results in lower levels of 3HP , with signiﬁcant diminishing
returns as E1 increases (Fig. 10). The negative effect of up-regulating E1 may appear
counter-intuitive, since E1 is required for a connected pathway. However, it can be
explained by noting that the effect of increasing E1 is to increase the amount of acetyl-
CoA in the system, which has the result of greatly increasing the amount of acetyl-CoA
that is taken up by the sink, but only slightly increasing the amount converted into
malonyl-CoA. This is because we have assumed that we are in a regime where the
sink has ﬁrst-order kinetics, whereas the reaction from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA
follows Michaelis–Menten-type kinetics. This effect may be reduced if we were in a
regime where the acetyl-CoA sink was saturating. Hence, our model suggests that a
slow conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is better for 3HP production if it is not
possible to over-regulate E
2. We note that this down-regulation is only important for
the maximum amount of 3HP produced when the time taken to produce this 3HP is
taken into account, as there is no dependence on E
1 in the effective production rate
(33). We emphasize that E1 → 0 is a singular limit in the system, which appears
because we are in the no-replenishment-of-pyruvate regime. As E1 → 0, the early-
time kinetics of the problem would vary, and we would not have the same late-time
problem that we consider here. We do not analyse this limit further, since it is not of
particular physical interest.

5 Discussion
We develop and solve a mathematical model for the reaction kinetics of the 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) pathway from pyruvate via malonyl-CoA. We consider
two main cases, continuous and no replenishment of pyruvate, to model the metabolite
dynamics in the two extreme cases of plentiful and scarce pyruvate. Our main goal
is to understand how to maximize 3HP production, and in the case of a continuous
pyruvate replenishment to additionally minimize the maximum levels of the toxic
intermediary malonic semialdehyde in the system, where possible. We summarize our
enzyme regulation recommendations for each case in Table 3.
We note that while our regulation recommendations suffer from diminishing returns
if implemented on a single enzyme at a time, we can overcome this issue in the
continuous-replenishment-of-pyruvate case if we up-regulate acetyl-CoA carboxy-
lase (EC 6.4.1.2) in tandem with 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.298).
Even though a solo up-regulation of either of these enzymes has diminishing returns
on improving the ratio of 3HP production rate to maximum malonic semialdehyde,
our analysis demonstrates that the up-regulation of both enzymes at the same time has
the nonlinear effect of strongly increasing this ratio with no diminishing returns, as
shown in Fig. 4.
We also emphasize that the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (EC
1.2.4.1, EC 2.3.1.12, and EC 1.8.1.4) is only important when the pyruvate is scarce.
In this case, the total 3HP produced can be increased, perhaps counterintuitively, by a
slight down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This is because there are
competing destinations for acetyl-CoA—either a sink out of the system or onwards
to malonyl-CoA—and the route out of the system becomes favoured as the amount of
acetyl-CoA in the system increases. Hence, a slower production of acetyl-CoA from
pyruvate is preferable to channel more acetyl-CoA towards malonyl-CoA rather than
to the sink, which means a down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. We
note that this effect disappears when we account for the time taken to produce the
maximal 3HP; the effective production rate of 3HP in this case has no dependence on
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Moreover, we emphasize that this down-regulation
effect is a singular limit of the system. Hence, one cannot obtain maximal 3HP by
completely removing pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from the system—in fact the
amount of 3HP produced would be zero if this enzyme were completely removed from
the system.
To deal with an inherent uncertainty in the parameter values, we maximize our
analytic progress by using an asymptotic analysis to solve the system, exploiting the
signiﬁcant difference in typical parameter ratios. This allows us to systematically
understand the effect of up- and down-regulating different enzymes without resorting
to an expensive parameter sweep. In the continuous-replenishment-of-pyruvate case,
our asymptotic analysis reveals a bifurcation in the asymptotic structure of the problem;
we quantify the effect of this bifurcation for 3HP production and derive an analytic
expression for the critical surface in parameter space at which this occurs. Physically,
this bifurcation corresponds to a sudden change in the large-time 3HP production
across the critical parameter.

For reactions between the metabolites we tracked, we use modiﬁed Michaelis–
Menten reaction velocities obtained from the literature, including the effect of
inhibition in the reaction from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA from both of these metabolites.
We add the effect of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA loss to other metabolic pathways by
including an aggregate sink from these metabolites, governed using ﬁrst-order reaction
kinetics. The initial conditions we used corresponded to an instantaneous introduction
of pyruvate to a well-mixed solution of enzymes containing no other metabolites. We
choose these conditions for mathematical convenience, as the real cells are likely to
contain an unknown level of the other metabolites in the system when production is
initiated. We do not expect this to be an issue for the case with a continuous replenish-
ment of pyruvate, in that we expect a small initial amount of intermediate metabolites
to change the early-time problem only. However, this is not true for the case with no
replenishment of pyruvate, as the depletion dynamics will be sensitive to the initial
conditions. Obtaining these measurements for the initial conditions would be difﬁcult
in vivo , though can be achieved by rapidly quenching the cellular metabolism before
using mass spectrometry to examine the metabolites (Bennett et al. 2009). In addition,
there may be cases where the assumption of a well-mixed system does not hold, in
particular over larger lengthscales, e.g. a colony of bacteria. In such cases, one could
determine effective reaction rates by coupling the nonlinear reaction dynamics we
consider here to spatial transport processes over longer lengthscales. This procedure
could be carried out in a computationally efﬁcient manner if one exploited the extreme
ratios of the different lengthscales in the system, as performed in Dalwadi et al. ( 2018)
for diffusive transport and linear reactions.
In this paper, we have accounted for the toxicity of malonic semialdehyde by con-
structing appropriate metrics to evaluate our results. That is, the toxic effect is not
directly included in our model assumptions, only analysed post hoc . Since this tox-
icity has a negative effect on biomass production, it could be included as a negative
feedback in ( 1) if appropriately quantiﬁed.
Finally, we note how this works highlights how mathematical modelling and asymp-
totic techniques can be used to understand a biological system, and to address the key
questions facing experimentalists. In this case, to identify a combination of enzyme
regulation with a greater theoretical output than could be obtained by measuring out-
puts from regulating just one enzyme at a time. This key insight into the system
behaviour was possible due to the asymptotic analysis allowing us to overcome uncer-
tainty in parameter values. We hope that these methods can be used to understand
other biological systems, and to reduce the time taken to explore their experimental
parameter space.

A Depletion Dynamics
In the case where the pyruvate is not replenished, the system we consider is ( 3), and we
no longer impose S1 ≡ 1. However, in the no-replenishment case, the leading-order
system is equivalent to the leading-order system for the continuous-replenishment case
until t = O(1/ϵ). Thus, it is helpful to work in the long timescale T = ϵt = O(1),
over which the full system is given by ( 8b)–(8d), along with

A.1 Slow Depletion of Pyruvate: 0 <T<T d
Over the timescale T = O(1) and until the pyruvate becomes of O(ϵ), the leading-
order system for S2, ˜S4, ˜S3, and P is still given by ( 9), the leading-order system for the
continuous-replenishment case. The leading-order equation for S1 is obtained from
(36a) to yield

in terms of S2. The solution ( 38) is valid until S1 = O(ϵ), at which point a new
asymptotic balance occurs. This occurs when T = Td (equivalently t = Td /ϵ), where
S1(Td ) = 0, (39)
with an O(ϵ) correction (equivalently O(1) in terms of t). Hence, Td can be obtained
by solving

forward in time, using ( 12), ( 14)–(15)f o r ˆS4, and terminating the calculation when
S1 = 0. Thus, this analysis is valid for T < Td .

A.2 Rapid Depletion of Pyruvate: t − Td//SI= O(1)
The next timescale is an interior layer (Holmes 2012), which occurs when t −Td /ϵ =
(T −Td )/ϵ = ¯t = O(1). Over this timescale, S1 varies from being of O(ϵ) to exponen-
tially small, while the remaining dependent variables are unchanged at leading order.
Making the scaling S1 = ϵY , the leading-order equation for the pyruvate concentration
in this interior layer is given by
dY
d¯t =− Y
¯K M
1 + YS 2
, (41)
with appropriate matching conditions as ¯t →− ∞ . This depletion results in the
exponential decay of Y , and hence S1, and is a slightly modiﬁed version of the coupled
pyruvate and acetyl-CoA depletion dynamics considered in Appendix B in Dalwadi
et al. ( 2018). As these depletion dynamics are not required to calculate details of 3HP
production, we do not consider the dynamics of S1 any further here for brevity; the
analysis will be similar to that in Dalwadi et al. ( 2018) and require ﬁrst-order correction
terms to match to an appropriate accuracy. Since S1 is exponentially small as we move
forward in time out of this interior layer, we henceforth treat it as zero in the remaining
timescales.
A.3 Slow Depletion of Acetyl-CoA: Td <T<T ∗
After the depletion of pyruvate, we remain in the timescale T = t/ϵ = O(1), but now
with T > Td . The system is thus given by ( 8b)–(8d), replacing ( 8a) with
dS2
dT =−
¯k2 S2
S2 + ϵ ¯K M
2
+
¯k5 ˆS4
ϵ ˆS4 + ¯K M

− ˆAS2. (42)
As each non-pyruvate dependent variable remains unchanged over the previous interior
layer, the correct matching conditions are obtained by imposing continuity of each
dependent variable across T = Td . The leading-order system is given by ( 9), replacing
the ﬁrst equation with
dS2
dT =− ¯k2 +¯v5 ˆS4 − ˆAS2. (43)
This system is solved by ( 11)–(12) and ( 15), along with
S2(T ) =−

S2(Td ) +

(44)
123

and these solutions are valid until S2 = O(ϵ), at which point a new asymptotic balance
will occur. This occurs when T = T ∗ (equivalently t = T ∗/ϵ), where
0 = S2(T ∗) =−
¯k2

∫ T ∗

¯v5 ˆS4(s)e ˆA(s−Td ) ds, (45)
with an O(ϵ) correction (equivalently O(1)in terms of t). After this point, the remaining
metabolites will all start to deplete, so P(T ∗) represents the maximal level of 3HP
in the system with no replenishment of pyruvate. Physically, t = T ∗/ϵ gives the
asymptotic “optimal” time at which to terminate a batch run and harvest the 3HP that
has been produced.
A.4 The Remaining Depletion Dynamics
The remaining depletion dynamics are unimportant to the task of determining the
maximal 3HP in the system, so we only state them brieﬂy here for completion. The
exact details of the transition of S
2 from O(1) to O(ϵ) occur in another interior layer
over the timescale t − T ∗/ϵ = (T − T ∗)/ϵ = O(1), where ˆS3 and ˆS4 also vary but
do not change in asymptotic order. Over this timescale, the levels of P do not vary. In
the forward-in-time far-ﬁeld of this interior layer, the levels of each metabolite tend
to a constant.
The ﬁnal depletion dynamics occur over the timescale T = t/ϵ = O(1), but with
T > T ∗. Over this timescale, the metabolites decay exponentially, governed by an
ODE for P with the remaining metabolites coupled to the levels of P in a quasi-steady
manner.
