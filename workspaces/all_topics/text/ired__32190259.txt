Biosynthesis of plant tetrahydroisoquinoline
alkaloids through an imine reductase route†
Lu Yang,ab Jinmei Zhu,b Chenghai Sun,b Zixin Denga and Xudong Qu *ab
Herein, we report a biocatalytic approach to synthesize plant tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids (THIQAs)
from dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) precursors using imine reductases andN-methyltransferase (NMT). The
imine reductase IR45 was engineered to signiﬁcantly expand its substrate speciﬁcity, enabling eﬃcient
and stereoselective conversion of 1-phenyl and 1-benzyl 6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQs into the corresponding
(S)-tetrahydroisoquinolines (S-THIQs). Coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT) was able to further
eﬃciently convert these ( S)-THIQ intermediates into ( S)-THIQAs. By assembling IRED, CNMT, and
glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in one reaction, we eﬀectively constituted two artiﬁcial biosynthetic
pathways in Escherichia coli and successfully applied them to the production ofﬁve (S)-THIQAs. This
highly eﬃcient (100% yield from DHIQs) and easily tailorable (adding other genes) biosynthetic approach
will be useful for producing a variety of plant THIQAs.
Introduction
Tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids (THIQAs) are a class of
important bioactive natural products.1 Molecules in this family
typically contain benzyl (benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, BIAs) or
phenyl (phenylisoquinoline alkaloids, PIAs) groups at the C-1
position and show a remarkable spectrum of biological activity
(Scheme 1).
1,2 Currently, more than a dozen of naturally occur-
ring or semisynthetic THIQAs have been used in the clinic for
treating a diverse range of diseases.
1–3 As most THIQAs are
produced by plants, signicant eﬀorts have been devoted in the
past few decades to develop synthetic approaches for their
preparation.
1 However, the unsatisfactory enantioselectivity and
high cost of asymmetric catalysis make chemical approaches
still commercially unfeasible.1
In natural products, THIQ sca ﬀolds are biosynthesized
through a Pictet–Spengler reaction.4 The major enzymes which
catalyze these reactions are norcoclaurine synthases (NCSs).
NCSs condense dopamine with 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-
HPAA) or 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-HPAA) to give rise
to (S)-norcoclaurine or (S)-norlaudanosoline.
5 Following decora-
tions by methyltransferases (MTs) or P450s, 4-HPAA and 3,4-
HPAA can be converted into (S)-reticuline (Scheme 2), a key
intermediate of/C242500 BIAs.5 With the growing understanding of
BIA biosynthesis, reconstruction of plant biosynthetic pathways
in microbial hosts has become a feasible strategy for producing
BIAs. By incorporation of partial or complete biosynthetic path-
ways in microbial hosts, a number of BIAs (i.e. opiates, sangui-
narine and noscapine) have been successfully synthesized from
simple precursors or glucose.
6 Such biosynthetic approaches can
become more economical and easy-to-operate than chemical
synthesis, making biosynthesis a highly attractive alternative.
Although great success has been achieved, there still remain
many challenges for microbial production of plant THIQAs:

thus, knowledge of essential genes for reconstitution of their
biosynthetic pathways is lacking. (ii) Most valuable THIQAs are
highly modied, i.e. bearing methoxy groups at the C6, C7, C3
0
and C4 0 positions. (iii) Reconstitution of the biosynthetic
pathways in microbes requires the introduction of a large
numbers of genes, which brings a heavy metabolic burden on
the microbe. Moreover, many plant enzymes such as OMTs and
P450s are poorly expressed or show low reactivity (NCSs) in
microbial systems.
6e,k,8 Therefore, production of plant THIQAs
in microbes oen results in very low yields.3 To avoid these
challenges, appropriately substituted precursors can be fed into
simplied biosynthetic pathways. However, such an approach is
restricted either by the narrow substrate scope of NCSs, whose
activity is strictly dependent on the C
6-hydroxyl and C8a-meth-
ylene groups (Scheme 2)9 or the stereochemistry at C1, which is
challenging to preparevia practical chemical synthesis.1
Recently, our lab and another group identi ed imine
reductases (IREDs) that are capable of reducing sterically
hindered 1-phenyl dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) to yield the
corresponding chiral 1-phenyl-THIQs.
10 In contrast to NCSs,
IREDs have a distinct catalytic mechanism, which does not rely
on the C
6-hydroxyl or C8a-methylene group, and therefore can
accept highly modied DHIQ precursors. Moreover, IREDs from
bacterial sources can be well overexpressed and show good
activity inEscherichia coli.Thus, by combining IREDs with other
modication enzymes, it is potentially feasible to produce
THIQAs through feeding DHIQ precursors. Herein, we demon-
strate this concept by using IREDs, N-methyltransferases
(NMTs), and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to construct two
minimal biosynthetic pathways. By incorporating these arti-
cial pathways intoE. coli, we successfully synthesize a group of
pharmaceutically valuable PIAs and BIAs. Our results demon-
strate that this strategy is an eﬃcient approach to the biosyn-
thesis of plant THIQAs.
Results
Engineering the substrate specicity of IR45 for the synthesis
of 1-phenyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-THIQs
Cryptostyline I, II and III (1–3, Scheme 1) are three PIAs isolated
from the plantCryptostylis fulva.11 They are used as pharmaco-
logical probes for understanding the pathophysiological roles
of peptides in the nervous system.
12 Unlike BIAs, the biosyn-
thesis of PIAs is still poorly understood, and currently the
biosynthetic genes of1–3 are not known. Given their valuable
pharmaceutical utility and representative roles for the PIAs,
these three products were chosen as the targets for this study.
Three 1-phenyl-6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQ precursors ( 1a–3a,
Scheme 3) corresponding to cryptostyline I–III (1–3) were ob-
tained in good yields (90–91%) by chemical synthesis (see the
ESI†). In a previous study, we identied an S-selective IRED,
IR45, which showed good tolerance toward 1-phenyl-DHIQs.
10a
Therefore, this enzyme was selected for activity assays with the
new substrates. Encouragingly, IR45 eﬀectively reduced 1a to
the ( S)-1-methylenedioxyphenyl-6,7-dimethoxy-THIQ ( 1b,
Scheme 2) with 100% conversion and >99% ee (Table 1),
although it showed no activity toward the two bulkier substrates
(2a and 3a). To gain a more detailed understanding of its
substrate specicity, the structure of IR45 was modelled based
on the IRED Q1EQE0 (64% identity, PDB: 3ZHB).
13 Docking of
1a into the binding pocket of IR45 indicated that the substrate
is closely surrounded by the conserved aspartic acid (D183) and
NADPH (Fig. 1). The imine bond is positioned close to thesi-
face of NADPH, consistent with the observedS-selectivity in the
product. The methylenedioxyphenyl group points to the right
cle, which consists of residues from two subunits of the
enzyme (V81, S107, E253
0 and H2570). On the other side of the
active site, the 6,7-dimethoxy aryl group is surrounded by two
residues, W191 and F190. These two bulky residues form the
Scheme 2 Approaches for plant THIQA biosynthesis.

bottom of the binding pocket, with F190 being the major
contributor to the pocket's overall shape.
From the model, it can be seen that the right cle forms the
major constraint for the accommodation of the methyl-
enedioxyphenyl group (Fig. 1). Engineering this area, however,
may signicantly impair the enzyme's activity and stability, as
residues in this region are crucial for inter-subunit interactions,
i.e. H257
0 forms a stabilizing salt bridge with R112. Thus, we
envisioned enlarging the binding pocket by engineering the
side of the pocket comprising F190 and W191. By mutating
these sterically demanding residues, we thought that the
substrate could be moved slightly deeper into the le cavity,
thus potentially relieving the steric hindrance between the right
cle and substrates2a and 3a.
In our previous studies, we found that W191 plays important
roles in substrate binding and maintaining the enzyme's cata-
lytically active conformation. Mutation of W191 to alanine or
leucine reduces thek
cat and Km for the substrate 1-phenyl-DHIQ
(6a, Scheme 3).10a To identify optimal mutations, W191 was
further mutated to the remaining 17 amino acids. These vari-
ants together with the W191A and W191L were assayed for the
reduction of 2a and 3a. Although most mutants were inactive,
one mutant in particular, W191F, showed marginal but clear
activity toward these substrates (3% and 2% for 2a and 3a
respectively, Table 1 and Fig. S1A†). To unveil the detailed
eﬀects of these mutations on the IRED's activity, we used the
more active substrate6a for activity analysis. Similarly, W191F
shows a clear improvement in the conversion of 1-phenyl-DHIQ
(1.5-fold), while the others all drastically reduce or even abolish
the catalytic activity (Fig. S2†).
Kinetic analysis of the most active mutants, including
W191F, W191C, W191M, W191H, W191N, and W191S as well as
previously obtained W191A and W191L revealed that theirk
cat
and Km values both have been reduced (Table S1 and Fig. S3A†).
However, unlike the other enzymes whosekcat is signicantly
reduced by one to two orders of magnitude, thekcat value of
W191F is decreased by only 1.8-fold (Table S1†), suggesting that
W191F has the least negative impact on the enzyme's catalytic
Scheme 3 DHIQ substrates prepared and used in this study.

conformation. As W191 is highly conserved, we assume that this
mutation should be benecial for many other IREDs.
The encouraging results with W191F inspired us to further
engineer the enzyme by targeting the adjacent residue F190. We
mutated all 19 other residues on top of W191F and then assayed
these double mutants for activity on the bulkier DHIQ
substrates. To our grati cation, one mutant F190L –W191F
shows drastically improved activity toward both2a and 3a (75%
and 100% conversion within 24 hours respectively) with very
high stereoselectivity for theS-products 2b and 3b (Scheme 2
and Table 1). Kinetic analysis conrmed that both2a and 3a are
good substrates for F190L–W191F (k
cat/Km values are 0.011 and
0.087 s/C01 mM/C01, respectively, Table 2). The identicalKm values
(0.307 mM for2a and 0.372 mM for3a) yet diﬀerent kcat values
(0.003 s/C01 for 2a and 0.032 s/C01 for 3a) suggest that binding
conformation accounts for the diﬀerence in their activity. This
indicates that other residues inuencing the binding confor-
mation in the cavity could be engineered to further improve the
enzyme's catalytic activity.
Through protein engineering, we have successfully broad-
ened the substrate specicity and enabled IR45 to eﬀectively
convert very sterically hindered DHIQ precursors into their
corresponding THIQs. In addition, the successful expansion of
the substrate specicity of IR45 demonstrates that alteration of
the sites that do not directly repel the substrate is indeed an
eﬀective way to optimize an enzyme's substrate specicity. This
strategy will be useful for engineering other proteins, in which
certain substrate–protein interactions are critical for main-
taining catalytic activity or active conformation.
Employing IR45 mutants to synthesize 1-benzyl 6,7-
dimethoxyl-THIQs
Because BIAs make up the remainder of the THIQA family, we
were interested in applying IR45 to their synthesis as well. (S)-
Laudanosine (5, Scheme 1) is a pharmaceutically important BIA,
naturally found in opium in minute amounts (0.1%).
14 Its
semisynthetic derivative atracurium is medically used for skel-
etal muscle relaxation during surgery and mechanical ventila-
tion.
3 By mild chemical oxidation, ( S)-laudanosine can be
readily converted into the antitussive drug ( S)-glaucine.15
Production of racemic (R,S)-laudanosine in E. coli has been
previously achieved through feeding (R,S)-norlaudanosoline to
a strain expressing O-MTs and NMTs. 16 However, the poor
activities of O-MTs result in low yields of (R,S)-laudanosine, and
the accumulation of many methylated intermediates (e.g. (R,S)-
reticuline, (R,S)-codamine and (R,S)-laudanine) complicates its
isolation (Fig. S4†). We chose to test our IRED approach in the
synthesis of 5 given its pharmaceutical value and (S)-1-benzyl-
6,7-dimethoxyl-N-methyl-THIQ (BzTHIQ, 4 in Scheme 1) given
its prototypical structure.
Two corresponding DHIQ substrates4a and 5a were chem-
ically synthesized (yields 95 and 93%) following a procedure
similar to that used in the synthesis of1a–3a. As W191 and F190
are critical for substrate binding, wild-type IR45 along with the
library of F190X–W191F (X denotes other 19 amino acids)
variants was tested for activity. To our gratication, wild-type
IR45 eﬀectively converted4a and 5a into the corresponding (S)-
THIQ products (100% conversion and >99% ee). The best
mutant F190M–W191F showed a further 6.8- and 1.8-fold
improvement in catalytic activity for4a and 5a, respectively (k
cat/
Km values for4a and 5a are 0.989 and 0.306 s/C01 mM/C01, Table 2).
It is intriguing that the wild-type IR45 can accept4a and 5a
whose planar frameworks are larger than those of the inactive
substrates 2a and 3a. To explore how diﬀerences in binding in
the enzyme cavity may account for this disparity in activity, we
docked 4a into IR45 (Fig. 1B).In silicoanalysis revealed that the
DHIQ plane of4a takes an identical conformation to that of1a.
On the other hand, the benzyl group of4a is bent toward the
large cavity underneath the right cle unlike the 1-phenyl group
of 1a which points directly towards the right cle. This diﬀer-
ence in positioning may result in less steric hindrance for the
otherwise ‘larger substrate’ 4a. This indicates that the rigid
frameworks of 1-phenyl DHIQs are indeed the most challenging
substrates for IREDs. Fortunately, our engineered mutant
F190L–W191F is able to eﬀectively convert the very sterically
hindered substrates 2a and 3a. In addition to the elevated
activity on 4a and 5a, F190M–W191F also shows a 2.23- and
3.79-fold improvement (k
cat/Km)o n 1a compared to wild-type
IR45 and F190L –W191F, respectively (Table 2). This
outstanding activity makes the imine reduction step highly
eﬃcient, ensuring the success of this strategy.
Conversion of THIQs into THIQAs by CNMT
Aer overcoming the bottlenecks associated with imine reduc-
tion, we turned our attention to the N-methylation step.

pathway of (S)-reticulene, introducing theN-methyl substituent
into coclaurine.17 CNMT fromCoptis japonicais known to have
a relaxed substrate specicity and is able to methylate THIQ
products.17,18 Therefore, it was assayed for N-methylation
activity on THIQ substrates1b–5b. To improve expression, the
CNMT gene was codon optimized for E. coli. As expected,
following optimization, CNMT was robustly expressed inE. coli.
To our gratication, CNMT eﬃciently converted allve of the
S-THIQ substrates into their corresponding N-methylated
products (100% conversion, Fig. S5A†). Kinetic analysis revealed
that CNMT showed similar activity to all 1-phenyl and 1-benzyl
substrates except for the most active substrate4b (Table S2†). As
these substrates are much bulkier than previously known
substrates of CNMT, we were interested in understanding how
they bind to the active site. Two representative substrates1b
and 5b were individually docked into the crystal structure of
CNMT (Fig. S6†).
18 Similar to the conformation of4a in IR45,5b
is bent, allowing it to be well accommodated in the binding
cavity. The substrates are bound in an identical orientation with
their methylenedioxy and methoxy groups in close proximity to
residues F322 and W329.
18 Previous work showed that two
mutants, F322A and W329A, had signicantly reduced catalytic
activity, with W329A having the most negative impact.18 In order
to maintain these hydrophobic interactions while enlarging the
binding cavity, we mutated W329 into phenylalanine. However,
like W329A, W329F showed drastically reduced methylation
activity toward1–5 (Fig. S7A†), conrming that W329 is indeed
critical for maintaining the enzyme's activity.
Production of THIQAs from DHIQ precursors through the
biosynthetic pathway of IRED–NMT–GDH
Armed with e ﬃcient imine reduction and N-methylation
enzymes, we proceeded to combine these two steps into one
biocatalytic reaction. The puried F190L–W191F and F190M–
W191F were coupled with CNMT and glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH, for recycling NADPH from glucose) for the synthesis of2–
3 and 1, 4–5 respectively. As expected, these enzyme cascades
can eﬃciently convert1a–5a into THIQAs with 100% conversion
(within 24 h, Fig. S7B†). Moreover, we observed thatN-methyl-
ation improved the conversion of substrates2a and 3a into their
corresponding THIQAs. We hypothesize that the continuous
removal of THIQ intermediates by their irreversible methylation
drives the equilibrium of imine reduction from DHIQs to
THIQs.
With the encouraging results ofN-methylation, we turned to
constitution of the articial biosynthetic pathway inE. coli.T o
achieve the highest transformation eﬃciency, each step was
evaluated individually in theE. coli system. We rst evaluated
the eﬀect of temperature and IPTG concentration on the IRED
reaction. E. coli stains containing F190M–W191F and GDH
(cloned into pET28a and pACYCDuet, respectively) were incu-
bated at 25, 30 or 37
/C14C and supplemented with1a and diﬀerent
concentrations of IPTG when their OD600 reached 0.7. The
biotransformation results show that lower IPTG dosage (20mM)
is better than a high IPTG dosage (Fig. S8A†) with conversion
reaching only 70% and 40% with 50mM and 100 mM IPTG,
respectively, aer 3 days. We found that temperature also had
a signicant impact on the conversion. The biotransformation
eﬃciency at 30/C14C is 5 and 10 times higher than that at 25/C14C
and 37 /C14C, respectively (aer 3 days) (Fig. S8B†). The optimal
conditions for the IRED–GDH combination appear to be 20mM
IPTG and 30/C14C. Next the conversion of the other four substrates
was evaluated under these optimized conditions (F190M –
W191F was replaced by F190L–W191F for2a and 3a). Although
4a and 5a can be eﬃciently converted into their reduced prod-
ucts (100%),1a–3a exhibit poor-to-medium conversion (6.5% to
50%) (Fig. S1C †). These ratios are much lower than the
conversion ratios of the in vitro enzymatic transformation,
suggesting that the 1-phenyl substrates1a–3a face diﬃculty in
permeating the cell membrane.
Next, theN-methyl transfer step was evaluated. Gratifyingly, all
the amine substrates,1b–5b, are completely converted into their
correspondingnal products under the same optimal conditions
as for IRED–GDH by E. coli containing CNMT (Fig. S5B†). As
methylation by CNMT appeared to improve the activity of imine
reduction, we co-expressed all three enzymes in a single cell (NMT
and GDH were cloned in pACYCDuet and IR45 in pET28a),
forming a minimal biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of
THIQAs. As expected1a, 4a and 5a (50 mg L
/C01) can be completely
converted into their corresponding alkaloids within one to three
days (Table 3 and Fig. 2). By extraction with ethyl acetate, pure1, 4
and 5 can be readily obtained in yields of 95%, 98% and 95%,
respectively. Conversion of2a and 3a also signicantly improved
(89% and 51% respectively, Fig. S7C†), compared to the conver-
sion by IRED–GDH (6.5% and 9.3%, Fig. S1C†).
In order to overcome the barrier of membrane per-
meabilization and further improve the conversion of2a and 3a,
we combined enzymatic and whole-cell biotransformation into
a single pot reaction. F190L–W191F and GDH wererst over-
expressed in a singleE. colistrain and then lysed by sonication.
The crude enzymes were directly added to theE. coli–CNMT
culture when the OD
600 reached 0.7. At this time, IPTG, DHIQ
substrates and NADP (1.1& w/v) were added simultaneously to
initiate the CNMT expression and cascade biotransformation.
To our delight, both2a and 3a (50 mg L
/C01) were completely
converted into their corresponding THIQAs (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
The isolated yields of2 and 3 are 93% and 96%, respectively.
Therefore, by systematically improving enzyme activity and
optimizing biocatalytic conditions, we successfully imple-
mented the IRED-based route to biosynthesize two types of
plant THIQAs.

Discussion
Lack of knowledge of key biosynthetic genes and poor expres-
sion/low reactivity of plant biosynthetic enzymes make recon-
stitution of THIQA biosynthetic pathways in microbes very
challenging. Currently, the biosynthetic enzymes, including the
key Pictet –Spengler synthase, that assemble PIAs remain
unknown. As such, reconstitution of PIA biosynthesis in
microbes is yet to be realized. Although the biosynthesis of
many BIAs is well understood and elegant examples of their
production in microbes have been reported, the poor perfor-
mance of NCS O-MT and P450 enzymes results in overall low
yields.
3 Eﬀorts to bypass such bottleneck enzymes by employing
modied precursors are also limited by the narrow substrate
scope of NCSs.9 IREDs, owing to their distinct catalytic mecha-
nism, are not restricted by the same limitations as NCSs.
Therefore, bottleneck enzymes such as O-MTs and P450
hydroxylases can be omitted and replaced by readily available
synthetic DHIQ precursors. In conjunction with NMT and/or
additional other modi cation enzymes, this IRED-based
approach has been shown to be very powerful in the biosyn-
thesis of plant THIQAs.
The major obstacle for application of this approach is the
generally poor tolerance of IREDs to bulky substituents at C1 of
DHIQs. IR45 is a steric-hindrance tolerating IRED identied in
our previous study.
10a Due to their more rigid conformations, 1-
phenyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-DHIQ substrates are more sterically
hindered than the 1-benzyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-DHIQs, and wild-
type IR45 showed no activity on the most sterically hindered
substrates 2a and 3a. To address this issue, we engineered IR45
to signicantly expand its substrate scope. Instead of engi-
neering the site of direct steric repulsion, we chose to alter the
other side of the binding pocket. This strategy was very eﬀective
for IR45 and may prove to be useful for engineering other
enzymes where certain protein interactions nearby the
substrate are critical for maintaining catalytic activity or
conformation.
The resultant mutant W191F–F190 eﬃciently and stereo-
selectively (ee > 99%) converted the very sterically hindered
substrates (2a and 3a) and the other three substrates (1a, 4a and
5a) into THIQs. The other mutant F190M –W191F showed
signicantly improved activity toward1a, 4a and 5a. As these
substrates are more sterically hindered than most other natural
PIAs and BIAs,
1,2 these IR45 mutants are potentially useful for
the synthesis of many other THIQAs. Practical application of
these enzymes can be backed up by the recently designed
strategy for scaling up IRED transformation.
19 In addition to the
IRED, we also found that the CNMT has a suﬃciently relaxed
substrate specicity to accept very bulky THIQ substrates.
Therefore, the broad substrate speci city of both the IR45
mutants and CNMT has provided a solid basis for the applica-
tion of this IRED-based biosynthetic strategy.
Although most natural THIQAs containS-conguration at
the C1 position, it is still interesting to generateR-type THIQAs
using this strategy. However, our attempt to produceR-1b–5b
using the most broad-selective R-type imine reductase IR2 (ref.
10a) was not successful. Like IR45, IR2 showsS-specicity to
convert 1a, 4a and 5a into the correspondingS-THIQs (2a and 3a
are inactive, data not shown). The reverse stereo-speci city
might be due to the occurrence of the 6,7- and 3
0,40-substituent
groups in the THIQ scaﬀold. Currently, protein engineering of
IR2 is in progress to reverse its stereo-specicity.
Finally, to accommodate the diﬀerent physical properties of
PIAs and BIAs, we developed two types of biocatalytic
approaches for their synthesis. BIAs can be biosynthesized
(100% yield) from their DHIQ precursors using the recombinant
E. colistrain expressing the articial biosynthetic pathway. Due
to the poor membrane-permeability of their DHIQ precursors,
PIAs 2 and 3 were not produced by a traditional whole-cell
system in suﬃciently high yields. To overcome this challenge
and avoid using the expensive S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
cofactor in theN-methylation step, we conceived a novel bio-
catalytic approach combining the enzymatic transformation of
IRED–GDH and the whole-cell transformation of CNMT in one
pot. This chimeric system is as eﬃcient as the cell-based system
(produces PIAs in 100% yield) and will be useful for biosyn-
thesis of other products with similar problems.
Conclusions
We have developed an IRED-based strategy to successfully bio-
synthesize ve pharmaceutically valuable PIAs and BIAs.

Notably, the three PIAs' natural biosynthetic pathways have not
been elucidated. Through protein engineering, we signicantly
expanded the substrate specicity of the IRED IR45. The two
resultant mutants F190L–W191F and F190M–W191F can eﬃ-
ciently convert bulky 1-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQ substrates into
(S)-THIQs. These two IREDs, highly tolerant of steric hindrance,
will also be useful for the synthesis of many natural and
synthetic THIQs. TheN-methylation enzyme (CNMT) was also
able to convert highly sterically hindered substrates. We also
developed an e ﬃcient and cost-e ﬀective enzyme/whole-cell
chimeric biosynthetic system to overcome the barrier for
biotransformation of membrane-impermeable substrates. Our
work demonstrates that this IRED-based biosynthetic approach
is eﬃcient (100% yield) andexible for the production of plant
THIQAs. By the addition of other modication enzymes, e.g.
P450 enzymes, this minimal biosynthetic pathway can be
further extended to the biosynthesis of other complex THIQAs.
