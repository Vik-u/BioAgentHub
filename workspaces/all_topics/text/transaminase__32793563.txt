The identiﬁcation and 3D structural characterization of a h omolog of the ( R)-selective
transaminase (RTA) from Aspergillus terreus (AtRTA), from the thermotolerant fungus
Thermomyces stellatus (TsRTA) is here reported. The thermostability of TsRTA (40%
retained activity after 7 days at 40 ◦C) was initially attributed to its tetrameric form in
solution, however subsequent studies of AtRTA revealed it also exists predominantly as
a tetramer yet, at 40 ◦C, it is inactivated within 48 h. The engineering of a cystein e residue
to promote disulﬁde bond formation across the dimer-dimer i nterface stabilized both
enzymes, with TsRTA_G205C retaining almost full activity after incubation at 50 ◦C for 7
days. Thus, the role of this mutation was elucidated and the i mportance of stabilizing the
tetramer for overall stability of RTAs is highlighted. TsRTA accepts the common amine
donors ( R)-methylbenzylamine, isopropylamine, and D-alanine as well as aromatic and
aliphatic ketones and aldehydes.

INTRODUCTION
A green chemistry approach to minimize the environmental impac t of synthetic processes entails
the use of biocatalysts, as they often oﬀer unmatched regio-, enantio-, and chemo-selectivity
(
Truppo, 2017 ). In addition, biocatalysts are bio-renewable and biodegr adable ( Sheldon and
Woodley, 2018 ). One class of biocatalysts, at the forefront of industrial applications, are
transaminases (TAs) (Fuchs et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2018 ), pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent
enzymes catalyzing the shuttling of an amino group between a n amine and a carbonyl group,
producing chiral primary amines, a highly desired reaction in industry ( Constable et al., 2007;
Savile et al., 2010 ). Both ( S)-selective transaminases (STAs) and ( R)-selective transaminases (RTAs),
belonging to separate fold types within the family of PLP-depen dent enzymes, are known.
RTAs share their fold type with branched chain amino transfer ases (BCATs) and D-amino acid
transaminases ( DATAS), which are signiﬁcantly more abundant in nature and well-ch aracterized,
while RTAs remained elusive prior to Höhne et al. (2010) describing a consensus motif. Since then,
several more RTAs have been reported, with just a few crystal s tructures solved. However the overall
number of known RTAs (and their solved structures) is still s igniﬁcantly smaller compared to STAs
(Guo and Berglund, 2017; Slabu et al., 2017 ).
The application of TAs (as well as other classes of enzymes) in c hemical synthesis is often
hindered by their insuﬃcient stability ( Bommarius and Paye, 2013 ). Key strategies to address this
Heckmann et al. Importance of the Tetrameric Structure
limitation include the sourcing of biocatalysts from
extremophilic organisms (
Littlechild et al., 2007 ), as well as
enzyme engineering ( Bommarius, 2015 ). To expand the toolbox
of RTAs in order to include more inherently stable catalysts,
the identiﬁcation of a homolog of the RTA from Aspergillus
terreus (AtRTA) (
Höhne et al., 2010; Łyskowski et al., 2014 )
from the thermotolerant fungus Thermomyces stellatus(TsRTA)
is here described together with its 2.2 Å crystal structure. An
in-depth investigation of the quaternary structures of both
RTAs is presented. RTAs are commonly accepted to exist
exclusively as dimers, while both dimeric and tetrameric ST As
have been reported (
Börner et al., 2017 ). Finally, we describe
the introduction of a mutation that stabilizes the quaterna ry
structure, improving the thermostability of both enzymes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Thermo Fishe r,
Alfa Aesar, Apollo Scientiﬁc, or Fluorochem and used without
further puriﬁcation. Restriction enzymes, polymerases, and
ligases were purchased from New England Biolabs. MALDI-TOF
MS was carried out using ground steel target plates on a Bruker
ultraFlex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. NMR spectra
were obtained using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
(Bruker AV3400HD). ESI-MS data were obtained on a Bruker
MicroTOF spectrometer.
Discovery of Novel RTA Sequences
Protein BLAST searches were performed with the sequences
of several reported RTAs against the NCBI non-redundant
protein sequence database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/Blast.
cgi) as well as the now defunct fungal genomics database
(https://genome.fungalgenomics.ca/) of the Genozymes proj ect.
Candidate sequences were searched for sequences from
extremophilic or extremotolerant organisms which were then
inspected for the consensus sequence described by
Höhne et al.
(2010) Multiple sequence alignments against several reported
RTAs were performed using MUSCLE ( Madeira et al., 2019 ) to
assess sequence identities.
pCH93b
The QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Ki t
from Agilent was used to introduce a TEV recognition sites
it pET22b( +) and to insert a second NdeI restriction site to
facilitate excision of the PelB sequence by digestion with N deI for
2–3 h [30 µ L reaction: CutSmart (10 x) buﬀer (3 µ L), restriction
enzyme (2 µ L; 40 U), DNA (2 µ g)]. Following gel puriﬁcation,
the backbone was then closed in a 16 ◦C ligation reaction [20
µ L reaction: 10x T4 ligase buﬀer (2 µ L), vector-backbone (200
ng), T4 ligase (1 µ L)] and transformed into E. coli XL10-
Gold using electroporation (see Supporting Information for full
plasmid map).

Cloning
The codon-optimized synthetic gene of TsRTA was purchased
from GeneArt in the cloning vector pMA, ﬂanked by BamHI
and HindIII restriction sites. Restriction digests of pMAT- TsRTA
and pCH93b- CvSTA were set up in separate vials as follows:
pMAT-TsRTA (700 ng) or pCH93b- CvSTA (1,500 ng), CutSmart
(10x) buﬀer (3 µ L), BamHI HF (2 µ L), HindIII HF (2 µ L) and
nuclease free water to 30 µ L followed by incubation at 37 ◦C
for 30 min. The backbone pCH93b and the insert TsRTA were
puriﬁed from an agarose gel (1%, 150 mA, 75 V , 50 min) using
the GeneJet gel puriﬁcation kit (excised backbone and insert
were combined prior to puriﬁcation). DNA was eluted in 43 µ L
nuclease free water (45 ◦C). 10x T4 ligase buﬀer (5 µ L) as well
as T4 ligase (2 µ L) were added. The reaction was incubated at
16◦C overnight. DNA was isolated by ethanol precipitation and
transformed into electrocompetent E. coli XL10-gold (1750 V ,
5.5 ms) and, following outgrowth in SOC medium (37 ◦C, 180
rpm 1 h), plated onto selective LB-agar plates (ampicillin (amp)
100 µ g/mL), and incubated at 37 ◦C overnight. The presence of
the insert and absence of mutations were veriﬁed by sequenci ng.
The synthetic gene of AtRTA was kindly provided by Johnson
Matthey. The gene was ampliﬁed (Q5 polymerase 2x Master Mix
(12.5 µ L), AtRTA_fwd (0.5 µ M), AtRTA_rev (0.5 µ M), template
(ca 1–10 ng), ﬁnal volume 25 µ L. Cycling conditions: 98 ◦C, 30 s;
30x (98 ◦C, 10 s, 67 ◦C 30 s, 72 ◦C 30 s); 72 ◦C 5 min, 4 ◦C. The
mix was puriﬁed (GeneJet PCR puriﬁcation kit), digested (PCR

kit elution buﬀer (25% v/v in nuclease free water, 65 ◦C), and
ligated (sample (25 µ L), 10x T4 ligase buﬀer (3 µ L), T4 ligase (2
µ L), incubation at 25 ◦C for 30 min, followed by 65 ◦C for 10 min).
Electroporation was then carried out as above, using 5 µ L of the
ligation mix.

Mutagenesis
The mutants AtRTA_G207C and TsRTA_G205C were prepared
using the QuikChange Lightning multi site-directed mutage nesis
kit from Agilent, following the manufacturer protocol: 10 ×
QuikChange Lightning Multi reaction buﬀer (2.5 µ L), pCH93b
harboring the RTA gene (ca 100 ng), primer (0.4 µ M), dNTP
mix (1 µ L), QuikSolution (1 µ L), QuikChange Lightning Multi
enzyme blend (1 µ L), nuclease free water (to 25 µ L). Cycling
conditions: 95 ◦C, 2 min; 30x (95 ◦C, 20 s, 55 ◦C 30 s, 65 ◦C

Expression and Puriﬁcation
pCH93b containing the synthetic gene was transformed into
BL21 STAR (DE3) E. coli cells. TB-medium (amp 100 µ g/mL)
(300 mL) supplemented with lactose (5 g/L) were inoculated
with a single colony and incubated at 37 ◦C, with shaking
(180 rpm) for 4 h followed by 25 ◦C with shaking (180 rpm)
for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 g,
15 min, 4 ◦C) and stored at −20◦C either as pellets or in
resuspension buﬀer. Proteins were puriﬁed by immobilized
metal aﬃnity chromatography (IMAC) as described by
Cerioli
et al. (2015) . Enzyme concentration was estimated by the
absorbance at 280 nm (non-denatured protein), using predicte d
extinction coeﬃcients ( TsRTA: 40493.38 Da, 53860 M −1
cm−1, AtRTA: 39860.55 Da, 50880 M −1 cm−1; https://web.
expasy.org/protparam/).
Size-Exclusion Chromatography
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried on a Superde x
200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), using a mobile
phase of potassium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM), sodium chloride
(100 mM), PLP (0.1 mM), pH 8. Injection volume: 100 µ L,
ﬂow rate 0.75 mL/min. Samples were prepared in potassium
phosphate buﬀer [50 mM), PLP (0.1 mM), pH 8 (with or without
sodium chloride (100 mM)], to a ﬁnal protein concentration of c a
2 mg/mL. Samples were either injected directly after preparati on
or incubated at ambient temperatures for varying amounts of
time to follow the interconversion of diﬀerent quaternary st ates.
A calibration curve was generated using the Sigma Aldrich Ge l
Filtration Markers Kit for Protein Molecular Weights 12,000 –
200,000 Da (MWGF200) ( Figure S4 insert).
Stability, Activity, and Kinetic Assays
Activity assays were based on the method by
Schätzle et al. (2009)
as applied in Cerioli et al. (2015) , with ( R)-methylbenzylamine
(RMBA) in place of SMBA in UV-free 96-well plates using
the EPOCH 2 plate reader at 30 ◦C unless otherwise stated
(pathlength 0.84 cm, calculated according to A977−A900
0.18 ), ε = 12.6
mM−1 cm−1).
Temperature, pH, and Co-solvent Stability Assays
The puriﬁed enzyme in potassium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM,
pH 8, 0.1 mM PLP) was diluted to a ﬁnal conc. of 0.30–
0.38 mg/mL with either phosphate buﬀer (temperature stability
assays), universal buﬀer adjusted to the desired pH (pH stabili ty
assays) (
Cerioli et al., 2015 ), or phosphate buﬀer containing
10 or 20% [( v/v), ﬁnal concentration] co-solvents (co-solvent
stability assays). Aliquots (30 µ L) were stored at 35–60 ◦C for the
temperature stability assays, 4 ◦C for pH stability, and 25 ◦C for
the co-solvent stability assays. For each time point, one ali quot
was brieﬂy centrifuged in a microfuge to ensure the complete
collection of the sample at the bottom of the tube, and incubate d
on ice for ca. 10 min. The standard activity assay described a bove
was performed in triplicate on each sample, using 3 µ L of the
enzyme sample per reaction. The sample was then discarded.
Temperature, pH, and Co-solvent Activity Assays
Modiﬁed activity assays were performed as follows: for
temperature activity assays, 3 µ L of enzyme solution, stored
on ice at the appropriate dilution (0.07–0.09 mg/mL), and 300
µ L of assay buﬀer, pre-heated to the desired temperature, were
combined. The assay was performed in a 96-well plate in a pre-
heated plate reader. For pH activity assays, assay buﬀer was
prepared in universal buﬀer (
Davies, 1959 ) at the desired pH.
For the co-solvent activity assays, assay buﬀer containing t he
desired co-solvent was prepared. To initiate the assay, 3 µ L of
enzyme solution, stored on ice at the appropriate dilution (0.3 7
mg/mL), and 300 µ L of assay buﬀer, were combined and the assay
performed as usual.
Kinetic Studies
Activity assays were performed by either ﬁxing the pyruvate
concentration at 10 mM (1% ( v/v) DMSO) while the RMBA
concentration was varied (0.005 to 10 mM) or with the RMBA
concentration ﬁxed at 2.5 mM (0.25% ( v/v) DMSO) and the
pyruvate concentration varied (0.005 to 10 mM), using puriﬁed
enzyme at the appropriate dilution (0.0030–0.0038 mg/mL, ﬁnal
concentration in the assay). Assays at each concentration w ere
performed in triplicate. Kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and Ki where
obtained by ﬁtting a substrate inhibition curve
(
v = kcat
1+ Km
[S] + [S]
Ki
)
using GraphPad Prism ( Copeland, 2000).
Substrate Scope Analysis
Reactions were set up containing RMBA (10 mM) [IPA (50 mM)
for acetophenone] and a carbonyl acceptor (10 mM), or
benzaldehyde (10 mM) [pyruvate (10 mM) for MBA] and an
amino donor [10 mM (20 mM for racemates)], puriﬁed TsRTA
(wild-type and mutant, 0.5 mg/mL), PLP (0.1 mM), DMSO (5
or 10% v/v) in potassium phosphate buﬀer (50 mM pH 8),
in a ﬁnal volume of either 600 µ L or 1 mL. Reactions were
incubated at 37 ◦C, 180 rpm in triplicate. Samples (100 µ L) were
quenched in with 900 µ L acetonitrile and aq. HCl (0.2%) (1:1
v/v) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Enantiopreference
was determined by chiral GC-FID or chiral reverse-phase HPLC
(see below). For the intensiﬁcation studies, reactions wer e set
up analogously but with an increasing amount of RMBA and
phenoxyacetone, and the ratio of enzyme to the substrate was
kept constant (0.1 mg/mL for a 10 mM reaction or 0.025 mol%).
Reactions were quenched analogously but with proportionally
increasing dilution factors.
MALDI-TOF MS
Protein samples (20 µ L) in potassium phosphate buﬀer [50 mM;
PLP (0.1 mM), pH 8] were diluted with an equal volume 1% TFA.
For preparation of reduced samples, TCEP (10 µ L of a 200 mM

stock) was added to the sample, followed by incubation at
70◦C for 15 min. Samples were then desalted using C4 ZipTip R⃝
pipette tips (Merck Millipore) as follows: The sample was bound
to the tip under saturating conditions, the resin washed (5%
methanol, 0.1% TFA in water; 20 × 10 µ L) and the protein
eluted in 5 µ L elution buﬀer (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in
water). The desalted samples (2 µ L) were mixed with 2 µ L of a
solution of sinapic acid (20 mg/mL; in elution buﬀer) of which
1 µ L was spotted onto a ground steel target plate, dried, and
coated with 1 µ L of the sinapic acid solution. The spots were
then analyzed using a Bruker ultraFlex III MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometer (laser amplitude 60%). External calibration rel ative
to HSA (66,440 kDa).

TsRTA Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystallization trials of TsRTA (10 mg/ml; 20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0; 0.1 mM PLP) were carried out using an Orxy 4
crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments) and ﬂat-bott omed,
Greiner CrystalQuick 96 well sitting drop plates (Greiner Bi o-
one). TsRTA microcrystals grown over 2–3 days at 20 ◦C in a 500
nl drop, containing 30% protein and PACT screen (Molecular
Dimensions) condition G3 (0.2 M sodium iodide, 0.1 M Bis-Tri s
Propane pH 7.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350), were used to prepare
a seed stock. Seeds were prepared using the Seed Bead Kit
(Hampton Research), crushing the crystals in 50 µ l well solution
by vortexing for 2 min. 0.15 µ l seed stock was used to seed a
second PACT screen, preparing 0.8 µ l drops at diverse protein
concentrations (31.25, 50, and 68.75%). For microseeding, t he
protein concentration was halved to 5 mg/ml. Crystals were
harvested from PACT condition C12 (0.01 M zinc chloride, 0.1 M
HEPES pH 7.0, 20% (w/v) PEG 6K) from a drop containing
68.75% protein. For cryoprotection, crystals were soaked in a
solution comprising 18.75% (v/v) PACT condition G3, 20% (w/v)
PEG6K, 0.1M HEPES pH 7.0, 0.002 M ZnCl and 28% (w/v)
ethylene glycol.
X-ray diﬀraction data were collected on a single TsRTA crystal
at 2.2 Å resolution on the XDR2 beamline at the ELETTRA
synchrotron facility (Trieste, Italy). Two TsRTA chains (C hains
A and B) were present in the asymmetric unit, with an estimated
Matthew’s coeﬃcient of 2.7 Å 3/Da (54.4 % solvent content). Data
reduction was carried out using Mosﬂm and assigned to the
body-centered monoclinic space group I 121 using POINTLESS
and scaled with AIMLESS (
Evans, 2011; Powell et al., 2017 ).
Molecular replacement was carried out using MOLREP and
chain A of the omega transaminase from Aspergillus terreus
(AtRTA; PDB entry 4ce5; 82% sequence identity over 321
residues) as a search model (
Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997;
Łyskowski et al., 2014 ). All programs are available under the
CCP4 suite ( Winn et al., 2011 ). The structure was manually built
and reﬁned to convergence using coot and phenix.reﬁne and
structure geometry was validated by Molprobity in the PHENIX
platform (Table S1) (
Davis et al., 2007 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Expression and Initial Characterization
of TsRTA
A putative RTA from the thermotolerant fungus Thermomyces
stellatus (TsRTA) with 81% identity to AtRTA (
Łyskowski et al.,
2014) was identiﬁed from a protein BLAST search ( Figure S1).
TsRTA was readily expressed at 25 ◦C and, following Ni-IMAC,
the enzyme was obtained in high yields (800 mg enzyme/Lculture)
and was judged to be pure by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S2). The
speciﬁc activity with pyruvate and RMBA was determined to be
2.5 U/mg ( AtRTA: 3 U/mg). The catalytic eﬃciency ( kcat/Km)
was comparable to AtRTA for RMBA and ca. 2-fold lower for
pyruvate ( Table 1). Substrate inhibition was observed in both
TsRTA and AtRTA for both pyruvate and RMBA, with higher
inhibition from the latter ( Figure S3).
The resting stability and activity of TsRTA were then
investigated under varying conditions. TsRTA was stable in
universal buﬀer between pH 5-9 for at least 14 days at 4 ◦C
(Figure S4a), and most active between pH 8-9, as is commonly
observed for RTAs (
Schätzle et al., 2011 ) (Figure S4b; it should be
noted the overall speciﬁc activity in universal buﬀer Davies, 1959
was lowered by ca. 20-fold). TsRTA was stable in the presence
of co-solvents such as 20% ( v/v) methanol, ethanol, and DMSO,
which are commonly used co-solvents in biotransformations,
with no loss of activity after 1 week ( Figure S4d). Stability
decreased with increasing chain length of alcohols, as well a s
THF, acetonitrile and to a lesser extent DMF. The activity in
the presence of co-solvents followed the same trends as the
stability (Figure S4c).
To assess the extent to which the thermotolerant origin of
TsRTA impacts its stability, thermostability assays were carri ed
out in parallel with both TsRTA and AtRTA.TsRTA retained 40%
activity when incubated at 40 ◦C for 7 days, whereas AtRTA lost
almost 90% activity within 24 h. However, at 45 ◦C, TsRTA almost

completely lost its activity within 2 h, while AtRTA retained ca.
25% activity after 4h ( Figure 1). Indeed, during temperature
activity assays AtRTA showed a higher optimum temperature
compared to TsRTA ( Figure 2), which showed loss of activity
over the 10 min activity assay from 50 ◦C onward.
SEC unexpectedly revealed that 90% of TsRTA in solution
exists as a tetramer, with only 10% adopting the dimeric
form ( Figure S5). Other highly similar RTAs, including
AtRTA (4ce5, 81% identity) (
Łyskowski et al., 2014 ), and
RTAs from Nectria haematococca (4cmd, 78% identity)
(Sayer et al., 2014 ), Exophiala xenobiotica (6fte, 70% identity)
(Telzerow et al., 2019 ), and Aspergillus fumigatus (4uug,
73% identity) ( Thomsen et al., 2014 ) are reported as
dimers based on their crystal packing. Two thermostable
BCATs, belonging to the same fold type IV as RTAs, with
hexameric structures have recently been reported by
Isupov
et al. (2019) . In addition, increased operational stability of
tetrameric STAs compared to dimeric STAs has been reported
(
Börner et al., 2017 ). Thus, the improved thermostability
of TsRTA was initially attributed to its tetrameric nature
(Littlechild et al., 2007 ).
3D Structural Analysis and Relation
to Thermostability
Electron density was well-deﬁned for residues 1–319 in both
polypeptide chains (A and B) present in the asymmetric unit,
but it was absent for TsRTA residues 320–334, in addition to
the C-terminal His-tag, due to ﬂexibility in this region. Bo th
polypeptide chains exhibit high structural similarity, with a n
RMSD of 0.24 Å for 319 aligned C α atoms, as calculated using
the CCP4i program SUPERPOSE (
Krissinel and Henrick, 2004 ).
Regions of poor electron density were observed for several side
chains from residues 126–132 that are located in a loop regio n
and solvent exposed. There was an area of positive density that
appeared to be continuous with the sidechain of D65 (Chain A),
observed in the diﬀerence map (mFo-DFc), that could not be
identiﬁed or modeled.

The TsRTA monomer adopts the classical aminotransferase
class IV fold (InterPro: IPR001544; Pfam PF01063) with a
signiﬁcant content of both α -helices and β -strands (3 β -sheets)
and can be observed to be sub-divided into two smaller
sub-domains (see Figure 3A and Figures S6, S7). A Profunc
search (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pr ofunc/)
(
Laskowski et al., 2005 ), as expected, identiﬁed AtRTA as the
top structural homolog (RMSD of 0.67 Å over 318 C-alpha
matched pairs).
The active site pocket houses a single PLP molecule, covalent ly
bound to each TsRTA chain via an imino bond with the conserved
active site lysine residue (K178) and additional hydrogen b onds
(2.6–3.0 Å) formed between the phosphate group of PLP and
side chain atoms from residues R77, E211, T237, and T273
(conserved in AtRTA); the phosphate group is further stabilized
by hydrogen bonds with R77 and N219 via two conserved
water molecules ( Figure S8) (
Łyskowski et al., 2014 ). E211
forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) with the pyridine nitrogen;
for other class IV members, it is suggested that the role of
this residue is to maintain the pyridine ring in its protonated
form, thus stabilizing the carbanion reaction intermediat e. The
pyridine ring is further stabilized by hydrophobic residues w ith
a conserved leucine residue (L233) and the backbone of a
conserved phenylalanine (F215).
An analysis of the dimer interface formed with the PDBePISA
server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/) revealed an inte raction
surface area of 2143.5 Å 2 mediated by 57 interacting residues
(Complexation Signiﬁcance Score (CSS) of 1.0). Contact surf ace
interactions comprise 30 hydrogen bonds and 10 salt bridges,
with an estimated solvation energy gain upon interface forma tion
of /Delta1Gi = −22.6 kcal mol −1.
A tetrameric structure of ATA-117-Rd11 (40% sequence
identity) has been deposited in the PDB as 5fr9 (
Cuetos et al.,
2016) This structure contains two disulﬁde bridges at the
tetrameric interface ( Figures 3C,D), while glycine residues are
found in all of the above-mentioned RTAs, as well as wild-
type ATA-117 ( Figure 3D and Figure S9). Despite the fact that
a tetramer interface was not predicted by PDBePISA, yet in
agreement with our experimental ﬁndings, a TsRTA tetramer was
generated by applying the symmetry operation (-x, y, -z) to the
asymmetric dimer, which superimposed well with the tetramer
of ATA-117-Rd11 (Figure 3B). Additionally, for all of the above
mentioned structures of RTAs, except for E. xenobiotica, a
similar crystallographic-tetramer can be obtained ( Figure 3C),
yet, interface analysis with PDBePISA, only predicted AtRTA
to form a tetramer. Gel-ﬁltration chromatography of AtRTA
then revealed a composition of 97% tetramer, 2% dimer and
1% monomer ( Figure S5). Analysis of known tetrameric STAs
(
Börner et al., 2017 ) (PDB entries 4b9b, 4atp, 3n5m, 3a8u, and
5lh9) showed PDBePISA only predicted the ﬁrst three to be stab le
tetramers in solution. Thus, the analysis of the “dimer of di mers”
structure by PDBePISA was deemed unreliable. Attempts to
disrupt the tetrameric structure by simple variation of the io nic
strength of the buﬀer (0–1,200 mM NaCl) were made but no
eﬀect was observed.
TsRTA_G205C and AtRTA_G207C variants, produced to
mimic the equivalent tetramer-bridging G215C mutation of
ATA-117-Rd11, exhibited a disrupted quaternary structure
immediately following puriﬁcation: a composition of ca. 55%
tetramer, 42% dimer, and 2% monomer and 28% tetramer, 19%
dimer, and 52% monomer were observed for TsRTA_G205C and
AtRTA_G207C, respectively ( Figure S5), as judged by SEC. This
can be attributed to an enhanced energy barrier for tetramer
formation due to increased steric hinderance from the cystei nes.
Indeed, incubation at room temperature with gentle agitatio n
showed slow reconstitution of the tetrameric form, but it ta pered
oﬀ over time ( Figures S10, S11), possibly due to incorrect
disulﬁde bond formation within the dimer. Incubation at 4 ◦C in
the presence of β -mercaptoethanol (10 mM) for 2 days, followed
by dialysis to remove the reducing agent and an overnight
incubation with aeration (to form the correct disulﬁde bond) , on
the other hand, resulted in 89% tetramer and 11% dimer, and
89% tetramer, 5% dimer, and 6% monomer for TsRTA_G205C
and AtRTA_G207C, respectively ( Figure S12). The presence
of a disulﬁde bond bridging two subunits was conﬁrmed by
MALDI-TOF MS ( Figure S13). For AtRTA_G207C, a 65%
increase in activity was observed following β -mercaptoethanol
pre-treatment. This matches the increase in the relative amo unt
of dimer and tetramer from 57 to 94%. Thus, the increase in
activity is due to the inactive monomer being converted into
the active dimeric and tetrameric forms. For TsRTA_G205C,
no such increase was observed implying that both the dimeric
and tetrameric forms have similar activities. Both enzymes ,
displayed only marginally lower speciﬁc activities over their
respective wild-type forms (1.8 and 2.7 U/mg vs. 2.5 and 3
U/mg for TsRTA_G205C and AtRTA_G207C, respectively) due
to a decreased kcat. Inhibition from pyruvate was no longer
detectable. The equivalent G207C mutation in AtRTA largely
had the same eﬀect, but, in addition, it increased the Km
of RMBA, lowering the catalytic eﬃciency further. Any eﬀect
on substrate inhibition was less pronounced and statisticall y
insigniﬁcant ( Table 1).

The slow formation of the quaternary structure provided an
opportunity to probe the thermostability of TsRTA_G205C and
AtRTA_G207C with diﬀerent proportions of the tetrameric form.
Both mutants showed increased thermostability compared to
the corresponding wild-type. However, the enzyme samples with
a lower proportion of tetramer (In this case, TsRTA_G205C:
75% tetramer, AtRTA_G207C: 55% tetramer) showed a drop
in activity within 30 min, followed by a more stable proﬁle.
Samples with 90% tetramer showed a much less pronounced
activity loss ( Figure 1). All samples showed a very similar proﬁle,
oﬀset by the initial drop, thus supporting that the tetramer,
stabilized by disulﬁde bonds, has improved thermostability over
the dimer. TsRTA_G205C showed higher thermostability than
AtRTA_G207C, and the switch in thermostability observed for
the wild-type enzymes between 40 ◦C and 45 ◦C was absent in
case of the mutants. The temperature optimum was shifted for
TsRTA_G205C showing considerable activity at 60 ◦C and 65 ◦C
but not for AtRTA_G207C which followed a similar proﬁle to the
wild-type (Figure 2).
These data suggest two diﬀerent mechanisms by which these
enzymes may lose their activity at elevated temperatures. Th e
ﬁrst, proceeding via dissociation of the tetramer followed b y
unfolding of the dimer, and the second being the direct unfol ding
of the tetramer. The ﬁrst mechanism presumably is eliminated by
the disulﬁde bond and it implies that TsRTA is inherently more
stable toward the second mechanism. This could explain why, at
40◦C, wild-type TsRTA is more stable than AtRTA. Yet, at 45 ◦C,
TsRTA might more rapidly dissociate into the dimeric form than
AtRTA, thus being less stable at higher temperatures (a weaker
dimer-dimer interaction is consistent with the higher proporti on
of dimer observed for TsRTA at equilibrium).
Substrate Scope
To further characterize the newly identiﬁed TsRTA, the scope
toward carbonyl substrates was examined ( Table 2). Aldehydes
such as benzaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, and vanillin were
accepted, but only traces of conversion were observed with

Ketoglutarate, the natural ketone acceptor for branched-ch ain
aminotransferases ( Höhne et al., 2010 ), was not a substrate,
as well as the bulky 2,2-dimethylhexan-3-one. However,
traces of conversion were observed when the propyl group
was shortened to a methyl group. Butanone gave low levels
of conversion. Extending the chain-length to hexan-2-one
increased conversion. In both cases only the ( R)-enantiomer was
detected, showing excellent discrimination between the me thyl
and ethyl group in butanone in particular. Cyclohexanone on
the other hand gave only low conversions. The heterocyclic
ketones tetrahydrofuran-3-one and tetrahydrothiophene-3 -one
gave higher conversions, yet poor enantioselectivity. Whil e
the expected ( R)-3-aminotetrahydrothiophene was produced,
(S)-3-aminotetrahydrofuran was preferred, in both cases with
ca. 20% ee. This is most likely due to diﬀerent electronic
interactions of the negatively polarized oxygen compared to
the more neutral and bulkier sulfur atom. Coincidentally, t his

revealed that the enantiomer produced by the Halomonas
elongata STA had been mis-assigned as ( S) ( Planchestainer
et al., 2019 ), and it is the unexpected ( R)-enantiomer that
is produced preferentially in that case. β -Hydroxy-pyruvate
reached its ﬁnal conversion of ca. 50% after just 30 min, probab ly
due to thermodynamic limitations. Acetophenone (with 5 eq.
of isopropylamine) gave only traces of conversion, similarly
to 1-indanone and propiophenone. o-Fluoroacetophenone
and phenoxyacetone gave good conversions. Substituting the
oxygen of the latter with a methylene (4-phenylbutanone)
resulted in moderate conversion. In all cases only the ( R)-
enantiomer was detected. To verify that TsRTA_G205C
has a similar substrate scope, biotransformations with 5
representative substrates which showed lower conversions
with the wild-type, were carried out with the mutant
variant: vanillin, hexan-2-one, o-ﬂuoroacetophenone, 4-
phenylbutanone, and phenoxyacetone. In all cases higher
conversions were achieved after 24 h, while conversions afte r
30 min remained similar to the wild-type. This indicates that
the higher resting stability of TsRTA_G205C also translates
into improved operational stability, increasing the number o f
turnovers of the mutant. As expected, the mutant maintained
excellent enantioselectivity.
TsRTA accepts the commonly used amine donors RMBA,
IPA, and D-alanine ( D-Ala), with the other enantiomers of
MBA and Ala not being accepted. As no pyruvate removal
or recycling system was used, the ﬁnal conversion with D-Ala
and benzaldehyde was only 30%, however this was reached
within 30 min. Only low conversion was obtained with β -Ala,
and only traces with o-xylylenediamine (
Green et al., 2014 ).
However, p-nitrophenethylamine ( Baud et al., 2015 ) was readily
accepted, making TsRTA suitable for colourimetric screening
during directed evolution ( Planchestainer et al., 2019 ), as was
the “smart” amine donor cadaverine ( Gomm et al., 2016 )
(Table 3).
To further investigate the beneﬁt of the increased
thermostability of TsRTA_G205C, the intensiﬁcation of
biotransformations with phenoxyacetone with one equivalen t
of RMBA as the amino donor were investigated for RMBA
concentration of 10 to 300 mM (incomplete dissolution
of phenoxyacetone for 100 mM and higher), employing a
catalyst loading of 0.025 mol%. Both variants showed similar
performance at the 10 mM scale, but the wild-type exhibited
a faster drop in conversion at increasing scales, reaching 1 3%
conversion at 300 mM vs. 31% for TsRTA_G205C (Figure 4). In
addition, the wild-type reached its ﬁnal conversion within 30 min
for concentrations of 50 mM and higher, while TsRTA_G205C
showed increased conversions after 30 min even at the 300
mM scale.
CONCLUSION
The predominant tetrameric composition in solution of two
RTAs,TsRTA and its homolog AtRTA, has been discovered. Upon
comparisons made between the crystal structure of TsRTA and

FIGURE 4 | Intensiﬁcation of biotransformations employing equimolar
amounts of RMBA and phenoxyacetone, at 37 ◦C. Reactions contained 0.025
mol% of transaminase, PLP (0.1 mM), DMSO (10% v/v for 10–200 mM, 15%
for 300 mM), and KP i buffer (50 mM, pH 8). Samples were taken after 30 min
and 24 h. Conversions are based on the formation of phenoxypr opan-2-amine
as determined by HPLC and calculated from a calibration curv e. All reactions
were carried out in triplicate. Error bars represent standa rd errors and include
the SE of the calibration curve ( Ellison and Williams, 2012; Theodorou et al.,
2012).
the crystal structures of RTAs deposited in the PDB, a likely
interface for the dimer-dimer interaction was also identiﬁ ed.
This interface was then probed by introducing a cysteine resi due
mimicking ATA-117-Rd11, which stabilized both RTAs and thus
rationalized the role of this mutation in the directed evolu tion of
ATA-117-Rd11. This dimer-dimer interaction was observed in all
but one deposited crystal structure of RTAs, although the posi tion
of the equilibrium between the dimeric and tetrameric forms in
solution is not known in most cases. SEC studies of the RTA fro m
Nectria haematococca have been reported to be consistent with
a dimeric form (
Sayer et al., 2014 ). While the wild-type TsRTA
was only marginally more stable than AtRTA, this diﬀerence was
signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed in the mutant variants. Thus, we propose
that two mechanisms, one where tetramer dissociation preced es
unfolding and one where unfolding occurs in the tetramer sta te,
might play a role in the inactivation of these RTAs. Clearly,
the full inactivation kinetics of both enzymes would need to
be studied in detail and in particular the relative kinetic an d
thermodynamic stability (
Bommarius and Paye, 2013 ) of the
tetrameric and dimeric forms for the wild-type enzymes shoul d
be elucidated.
The full understanding of the quaternary structure of
RTAs is particularly important with regard to rational
approaches to enzyme engineering. The stabilization of the
tetrameric form of RTAs through the mutation described
herein, which could not have been predicted from a dimeric
model, appears to be a promising strategy to stabilize RTAs
(the residue mutated herein being present in all reported
RTA structures). Additional mutations stabilizing this
interface may also be possible, creating more stable and
therefore more evolvable (
Bloom et al., 2006 ) and industrially
useful catalysts.
