Lactococcus lactis NCDO 2118 was previously selected for its ability to decarboxylate
glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an interesting nutritional supplement able to
improve mood and relaxation. Amino acid decarboxylation is generally considered as
among the biochemical systems allowing lactic acid bacteria to counteracting acidic
stress and obtaining metabolic energy. These strategies also include arginine deiminase
pathway and malolactic fermentation but little is known about their possible interactions
of with GABA production. In the present study, the effects of glutamate, arginine, and
malate (i.e., the substrates of these acid-resistance pathways) on L. lactis NCDO 2118
growth and GABA production performances were analyzed. Both malate and arginine
supplementation resulted in an efﬁcient reduction of acidity and improvement of bacterial
biomass compared to glutamate supplementation. Glutamate decarboxylation was
limited to narrow environmental conditions (pH< 5.1) and physiological state (stationary
phase). However, some conditions were able to improve GABA production or activate
glutamate decarboxylation system even outside of this compass. Arginine clearly
stimulated glutamate decarboxylation: the highest GABA production (8.6 mM) was
observed in cultures supplemented with both arginine and glutamate. The simultaneous
addition of arginine, malate, and glutamate enabled earlier GABA production (i.e., during
exponential growth) at relatively high pH (6.5). As far as we know, no previous study has
reported GABA production in such conditions. Although further studies are needed to
understand the molecular basis of these phenomena, these results represent important
keys suitable of application in GABA production processes.

INTRODUCTION
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive microaerophilic microorganisms extensively used
in the agro-food industry because of their high lactic acid production and consequent food
acidiﬁcation. This is an appreciated feature for both prolongation of food shelf-life and
biocontrol of food born infections, since most spoilage and pathogenic bacteria are acid-sensitive
(
Trias et al., 2008). The acid-resistance of LAB is based upon diﬀerent, either constitutive or
inducible, mechanisms which include: (i) cytoplasm alkalinization by H +consumption through
decarboxylation mechanisms, or arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway or urease reaction; (ii) changes

in the composition of the cell envelope; (iii) production of general
shock proteins (chaperones); and (iv) changes in cell density (for
a review, see Cotter and Hill, 2003). Most of these strategies
involve the expression of genes which improve cell resistance to
adverse conditions. In lactococci the main metabolic mechanisms
involved in pH homeostasis are ADI, malolactic fermentation
(MLF) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) systems ( Figure 1).
Nowadays, little is known about possible interactions between
these metabolic systems in L. lactis.
Arginine deiminase pathway consists of three reactions
converting arginine to ornithine, NH 3, CO 2, and ATP. This
route is catalyzed by three enzymes: ADI (converting arginine
to citrulline and NH 3), ornithine transcarbamylase (converting
citrulline to ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate), and carbamate
kinase (converting carbamoyl phosphate to NH 3, CO 2, and
ATP), encoded by the genes arcA, arcB, and arcC, respectively
(Figure 1). These enzymes appear to be acid resistant (Casiano-
Colón and Marquis, 1988). The eﬃciency of the overall pathway
is increased by arginine supplementation (Poolman et al.,
1987). The ADI pathway provides both cytoplasm alkalinization,
through release of NH 3, and metabolic energy production, since
ATP is generated by substrate level phosphorylation in the
reaction catalyzed by carbamate kinase. The ADI systems of
Lactobacillus sakei (Zuniga et al., 1998), Enterococcus faecalis
(Simon et al., 1982), and LAB strains associated with cheese
fermentations (Crow and Thomas, 1982) or colonizing oral
cavity (Marquis et al., 1987; Dong et al., 2002) are subject to
catabolite repression by glucose. However, in L. sanfranciscensis
(De Angelis et al., 2002), Oenococcus oeni, and other wine LAB
(Liu et al., 1996) glucose and arginine can be concomitantly
catabolized.
Malolactic fermentation is the conversion of dicarboxylic
malic acid to monocarboxylic L-lactic acid by malolactic enzyme
(Figure 1 ). L-lactate is excreted via electrogenic transporters,
i.e., by either lactateñmalate antiporter ( L. lactis ) or lactate
uniport ( O. oeni and L. plantarum ) (Konings et al., 1997)

depending on the strain, which allow production of proton
motive force. Furthermore, due to the p Ka diﬀerence of the
carboxylic groups of malate and lactate, replacement of malate
by lactate results in alkalinization of the extracellular medium.
A further relevant malate dissimilation pathway which can
contribute to acid resistance of LAB is oxidative decarboxylation
of malate to pyruvic acid (catalyzed by malic enzyme; Landete
et al., 2013). It is generally accepted that malate utilization
through MLF cannot sustain growth per se (since lactate
cannot be used as a carbon source by most LAB), while its
metabolism via malic enzyme enables LAB to use it as the
only carbon source. Distribution of malic enzyme currently
seems restrained to fewer strains (including L. lactis NCDO
2118) with respect to MLF (Landete et al., 2013; Oliveira
et al., 2014). However, malic enzyme has been studied at
much lesser extent than MLF and, currently, contribution of
malic enzyme pathway to LAB metabolism cannot be precisely
evaluated.
Like other amino acid decarboxylations, glutamate conversion
to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important strategy to
counteract excess of acidity (Schelp et al., 2001; Van de
Guchte et al., 2002; Pessione, 2012) since the reaction itself
is proton consuming and results in alkalinization of the
cytoplasmic compartment (Small and Waterman, 1998). GAD
system has been reported in both Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria (Small and Waterman, 1998; Bhagwat and
Bhagwat, 2004; Cotter et al., 2005; Tramonti et al., 2006) and
includes proton-consuming decarboxylation of glutamate by
GAD in the cytoplasm and cell membrane-located electrogenic
glutamate/GABA antiporters which generate proton motive
force (Molenaar et al., 1993; Higuchi et al., 1997; Lu et al.,
2013; Tsai et al., 2013) ( Figure 1 ). The expression of GAD in
L. lactis is increased by low pH and glutamate supplementation
(Sanders et al., 1998). Recent studies have identiﬁed a further
acid-resistance mechanism in L. reuteri and Escherichia coli
which is based on glutamine and can be interpreted as an
“extension” of the GAD system (Lu et al., 2013; Teixeira et al.,
2014). Both glutaminase, which catalyzes glutamine deamidation
(producing ammonia and glutamate), and GAD are present in
the cytoplasm of these strains and contribute to intracellular
alkalinization. These studies indicated that GadC, which had been
previously identiﬁed as a glutamate/GABA antiporter, is also
able to mediate uptake of glutamine or extrusion of glutamate.
A gene encoding a putative glutamine/GABA antiporter has been
identiﬁed in the genome of O. oeni PSU-1 also (Mills et al.,
2005).
Lactococcus lactis NCDO 2118 is able to biosynthesize GABA
by glutamate decarboxylation. A previous transcriptomic and
proteomic study demonstrated that ADI pathway genes ( arcA,
arcD1, arcB, and arcC2) are down-regulated in glutamate-
supplemented/GABA-producing conditions, thus suggesting
that glutamate decarboxylation and arginine deimination are
competing routes in this strain (Mazzoli et al., 2010). The present
investigation aimed to better establish the relative contribution
of GAD, ADI, and MLF pathways in energy metabolism and
acid resistance of L. lactis NCDO 2118 and possible reciprocal
interactions of these metabolic systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strain
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NCDO 2118 from vegetable
origin was used throughout this study. This strain was selected
during preliminary studies as the only one able to biosynthesize
detectable amounts of GABA among the L. lactis strains available
in the laboratory microbial collection (LISBP of INSA-Toulouse,
France).
Culture Conditions
Cultures in Tubes
Cultures were grown in the chemically deﬁned medium (CDM;
Otto et al., 1983; Poolman and Konings, 1988), containing
glucose (20 g L −1) under anaerobic conditions, i.e., in N 2
atmosphere, in butyl rubber-stoppered tubes at 30 ◦C. The initial
pH was 6.6. Furthermore, diﬀerent concentrations of glutamate
and/or arginine and/or malate were added into the medium
depending on the study. All the experiments were performed in
duplicate. Inoculation was with cells from precultures harvested
during the exponential phase and concentrated in order to
obtain an initial optical density at 580 nm (OD 580) of 0.05
in the tubes. During incubation, 1 mL samples were taken
every 30 min so as to measure the OD 580 with Spectronic 301
spectrophotometer (Milton Roy, Pont Saint Pierre, France). The
maximum growth rate (µmax) was then determined. pH was also
regularly measured with pH meter (Metrohm 744, Villebon Sur
Yvette, France).
Cultures in Fermenter
Bacterial cultures were performed in duplicate in 2 L Biostat
B plus fermenter (Sartorius, Melsungen, Germany) ﬁlled with
glucose (20 g L −1) containing-CDM or the same medium
supplemented with 5 g L −1 (34 mM) glutamate and/or 5 g L −1
(29 mM) arginine and/or 20 g L −1 (149 mM) malate. Cultures
were incubated at 30 ◦C in anaerobiosis, obtained by slight N 2
overpressure. pH was maintained at 6.6 by KOH addition until
cultures reached OD 580 =1, in order to reach enough biomass
for further analytical procedures, and then pH was not regulated
anymore. Bacterial growth was monitored by measurement of
OD580 (Libra S11, Biochom, 1 Unit of absorbance is equivalent
to 0.3 g L −1). Samples were collected every 30 min for
HPLC determination of metabolite concentration in the growth
medium.
Metabolite Determination
Glucose, malate, and metabolite (i.e., lactate, acetate, formate
and ethanol) concentrations were measured in culture super-
natants by high performance liquid chromatography (Agilent
Technologies 1200 Series, Waldbronn, Germany) using a
HPX87H+ Biorad column and the following conditions: a
temperature of 48 ◦C, eluent H 2SO4 (5 mM) at a ﬂow rate of
0.5 mL min−1, and dual detection (refractometer and UV).
Free amino acid and GABA concentration in culture super-
natants was measured by HPLC system (Agilent Technologies
1200 Series, Waldbronn, Germany). Prior to HPLC deter-
mination, proteins in the samples were precipitated by adding

four volumes of methanol followed by overnight incubation
on ice. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant kept
for HPLC analysis. Amino acids were automatically derived
with OrthoPhtalic Aldehyde (OPA) and 9-ﬂuorenylmethyl-
chloroformiate (FMOC-C1). The derivatives were separated on
Hypersil AA-ODS column (Agilent Technologies) at 40 ◦C by
a linear gradient of acetate buﬀer (pH 7.2) with triethylamin
(0.018 %), tetrahydrofuran (0.3%) and acetonitrile. A diode array
detector, at 338 nm for OPA derivatives and 262 nm for FMOC
derivatives, was used.
Statistical Methods
Student’s t-test was applied to each parameter ( Table 1 ) in
order to detect signiﬁcant diﬀerences between culture conditions
(CDM or CDM supplemented with glutamate as the references).
A p-value lower than 0.025 was considered as signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Growth and Metabolism of L. lactis
NCDO 2118 in Control Conditions
Fermentation proﬁles of L. lactis NCDO 2118 in glucose-
containing chemically deﬁned medium (CDM), in unregulated
pH conditions, were determined. Growth started immediately
after inoculum at maximal growth rate ( µmax =0.97 h −1),
and stopped after 5 h, at a biomass concentration of about
1 g L −1 (Figure 2 ; Table 1 ). At that time, the pH was
about 4.9ñ5.0, and it further gradually decreased during the
stationary phase until 4.2 (13 h after inoculum). L. lactis
NCDO 2118 showed high maximal glucose consumption rate
(27.7 mmol g −1 h−1) and exhibited homolactic metabolism all
along the growth phases, leading to accumulation of 65.6 mM
lactate (Table 1). Growth stopped before glucose depletion. We
have performed cultures in the same medium but at regulated
pH (6.6) during all the fermentation. In these conditions,
growth continued until glucose exhaustion, demonstrating that

(h−1; ▲), and pH (•) during growth of L. lactisNCDO 2118 in chemically

acidic pH is responsible for the growth arrest in our control
conditions.
The growth medium used in this study did contain no
glutamate while low concentrations of arginine and glutamine
(0.6 and 3.0 mM, respectively) were present. Arginine was quickly
exhausted (qmax =1.44 mmol g −1 h−1) and stoichiometrically
converted to ornithine and citrulline. About half of the initial
glutamine was consumed ( qmax =1.22 mmol g −1 h−1) in 48 h,
leading to accumulation of 0.5 mM of glutamate and 0.4 mM of
GABA in the growth medium (Table 1).
Effect of Glutamate or Arginine or Malate
Supplementation on Growth and
Metabolism of L. lactisNCDO 2118
In order to study the eﬀect of glutamate or arginine or malate
on metabolic proﬁles of L. lactis NCDO 2118 cultures were
performed in glucose-CDM medium supplemented with each
of these single compounds at regulated and unregulated pH
as described below. GABA was never produced in regulated
pH conditions (pH =6.6). It was detected at unregulated pH
and only cultures performed in these conditions are described
below.
Effect of Glutamate
The eﬀect of diﬀerent glutamate concentrations, ranging from
0 to 20 g L −1 (0ñ136 mM) was tested in tube cultures.
Neither speciﬁc growth rate nor ﬁnal biomass was aﬀected
by the diﬀerent glutamate concentrations used ( Figure 3A ).
However, slight variations in ﬁnal pH and, more importantly,
changes in amounts of accumulated GABA were observed among
the diﬀerent glutamate-supplemented cultures. The higher was
glutamate supplementation, the higher was the ﬁnal pH and
the amount of GABA which was accumulated (pH = 4.1,
0.3 mM of GABA in cultures without glutamate supplementation;
pH = 4.5, 3.8 mM GABA in cultures supplemented with
136 mM glutamate). It is worth noting that glutamate/GABA
conversion yield was not the same in each condition since
it was higher in cultures supplemented with lower glutamate
concentration (i.e., 35 % in cultures containing 3.4 mM
glutamate) and progressively decreased at higher glutamate
supplementation (i.e., 3% in cultures containing 136 mM
glutamate; Figure 4).
The medium containing 5 g L −1 glutamate (34 mM) retained
our attention since it displayed high production of GABA with
intermediary glutamate/GABA conversion yield. This condition
was also previously used for transcriptomeñproteome analysis
(Mazzoli et al., 2010). Cultures were performed in fermenter in
order to provide detailed metabolic parameters. As determined
for tube-cultures (see above), glutamate supplementation did not
aﬀect µmax and ﬁnal biomass with respect to control cultures.
Glutamate supplementation did not have any eﬀect on glucose
consumption rate, although a slightly higher glucose amount
was consumed in these condition leading to accumulation of
higher amounts of lactic acid (Table 1). Both ﬁnal pH and GABA
accumulation at 48 h were higher in glutamate-supplemented
culture, thus conﬁrming results obtained in tube cultures.

of 0.025 and 0.01, respectively.
It is worth noting that the amount of glutamine consumed
was similar to control cultures, although maximal glutamine
consumption rate was signiﬁcantly lower, and that 5.5 mM of
glutamate was consumed leading to accumulation of 3.12 mM
GABA ( Table 1 ). Finally, glutamate supplementation did not
display any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on arginine consumption rate
(Table 1).
Effect of Arginine
Cultures of L. lactis NCDO 2118 were performed in tubes
containing glucose-CDM medium supplemented with arginine
concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 g L −1 (0ñ144 mM).
Increasing amounts of supplemented arginine progressively
caused: (i) a slight decrease of the maximal growth rate (from 1
to 0.8 h −1); (ii) a strong increase of both the ﬁnal biomass, and
(iii) ﬁnal pH (from pH =4.1 to pH =6.6; Figure 3B). Arginine
was depleted 6 h after inoculum in every tested culture and
progressive alkalinization of ﬁnal pH (proportional to increasing
initial concentration of arginine) was observed. This was likely
related to production of higher amounts of NH 3 by arginine
metabolization through the ADI route. Interestingly, arginine
addition up to 10 g L −1 (57 mM) progressively enhanced GABA
production up to 1.9 mM ( Figure 3B ). Since the medium did
not contain glutamate, this was likely the result of increased
bioconversion of glutamine. However, for higher initial arginine
concentrations, GABA accumulation was markedly decreased to
levels similar to those of control cultures. This was probably
caused by excessive medium alkalinization and consequent
inhibition of glutamate decarboxylation system.
Arginine at 29 mM (5 g L −1) was chosen for further
experiments in fermenter, since this culture condition was
characterized by the highest speciﬁc GABA production
(i.e., amount of GABA/ﬁnal biomass ratio). Such arginine
supplementation did not signiﬁcantly increase the µmax but
doubled ﬁnal biomass with respect to control conditions
(Table 1). Although arginine was completely exhausted at the
growth arrest at 6 h, the extracellular pH at this point, was
not much more alkaline than in control conditions. However,
in arginine-supplemented cultures a twofold higher glucose
amount was consumed leading to a ﬁnal lactate concentration
of about 123.3 mM which likely had a neutralizing eﬀect on
the NH 3 released via the ADI pathway ( Table 1). Consistently,
ornithine and citrulline accumulated in the culture broth and
levels were proportional to arginine consumption. No putrescine
was detected.
As observed in tube-cultures, arginine supplementation
also enhanced GABA production. Accumulation of increased
amounts of GABA cannot be explained only by the higher
biomass achieved in arginine-supplemented cultures, since
biomass was increased by twofold whereas GABA accumulation
was enhanced by fourfold at 48 h. On the other hand,
speciﬁc glutamine consumption rate was similar to values
measured in control conditions. These observations suggest that
arginine directs a higher proportion of glutamine metabolic

Effect of Malate
Cultures of L. lactis NCDO 2118 in tubes containing glucose-
CDM medium supplemented with malate concentration ranging
from 0 to 50 g L −1 (0ñ373 mM) were performed ( Figure 3C).
With increasing malate supplementation, ﬁnal pH and µmax
were aﬀected in somehow similar ways as what observed in
arginine fortiﬁed cultures, i.e., ﬁnal pH progressively raised, while
µmax was lower for higher malate supplementation. Taking into
account that supplemented concentrations of malate were more
than twofold higher than for arginine, malate supplementation
had more limited eﬀects on acid neutralization (ﬁnal pH
with 50 g L −1 malate supplementation was about 7). On the
contrary, such high malate concentration negatively aﬀected
µmax (i.e., it was reduced from 1 to 0.4 h −1). A moderate
ﬁnal biomass increase (up to 1.4 g L −1) was observed up to
malate concentration of 40 g L −1 (298 mM). Higher malate
supplementation caused reduction of ﬁnal biomass to levels lower
than control conditions.
Cultures of L. lactis NCDO 2118 in glucose-CDM medium
containing 20 g L −1 (149 mM) malate were performed in
fermenter also. This condition was chosen since the GABA

growth rate, ﬁnal biomass and ﬁnal extracellular pH were
coherent with results obtained in tube cultures with the same
malate concentration. This condition was the one stimulating
the consumption of the highest amount of glucose compared
to reference conditions or supplementations with glutamate or
arginine at 48 h ( Table 1). Actually, glucose was almost depleted
after 12 h of culture, although speciﬁc glucose consumption
rate was similar the other growth conditions tested. However,
malate supplementation did not stimulate any further GABA
accumulation with respect to control conditions ( Table 1 ).
Curiously, malate seems to increase arginine consumption rate
(2.69 mmol g−1 h−1) with respect to cultures on CDM.
Cultures Supplemented with Glutamate
Plus Arginine or Glutamate Plus Malate
Effect of Simultaneous Arginine and Glutamate
Supplementation
The simultaneous addition of arginine and glutamate to
the glucose-CDM medium was studied in fermenter. The
concentrations of arginine (5 g L −1, 29 mM) and glutamate
(5 g L −1, 34 mM) were chosen according to the individual
fermenter conditions previously tested. A slightly decreased
maximal growth rate (µmax =0.89 h−1) was observed while ﬁnal
pH was similar to cultures supplemented with glutamate only
(Table 1). Final biomass at the growth arrest was also signiﬁcantly
higher like cultures supplemented with arginine only. However,
GABA production was strongly enhanced since 8.6 mM were
accumulated in the medium, that is almost threefold higher that
in cultures supplemented with glutamate only. This was the
highest amount of GABA accumulation observed in this study
and was likely the result of both higher substrate availability
(i.e., glutamate supplementation) and stimulation of GABA
production by arginine, conﬁrming results obtained in cultures
supplemented with arginine only.
Effect of Simultaneous Malate and Glutamate
Supplementation
In a similar way, the eﬀect of simultaneous malate and glutamate
supplementation was tested in fermenter. This condition
noticeably reduced µmax (0.81 h −1) with respect to control
conditions as observed in cultures supplemented with glutamate
only ( Table 1 ). However, the speciﬁc glucose consumption
rate was similar ( Table 1 ). Final biomass and extracellular
pH at the growth arrest, as well as glucose consumption and
lactate production at 48 h were higher than the reference
but similar to that measured in cultures fortiﬁed with malate
only. Hence, contribution of glutamate to energy metabolism
seems negligible. This is conﬁrmed by the fact that in this
condition only 2.54 mM of GABA was accumulated at 48 h.
This value is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from GABA amounts
observed in culture supplemented with glutamate only. These
data, taken together with the fact that in malate-plusñglutamate-
supplemented cultures biomass production was higher than in
culture supplemented with glutamate only, suggest that malate
somehow repressed GABA production pathway(s). On the other
hand, speciﬁc malate consumption rate was slightly lower than in
cultures supplemented with malate only (Table 1).

Cultures of L. lactis NCDO 2118 were performed in CDM

of growth (in agreement with the high sugar consumption rate
observed in other malate-supplemented cultures) initial glucose
concentration was increased to 45 g L−1 (250 mM) so as to avoid
growth limitation by sugar depletion.
As for other malate supplemented cultures, growth was at
slightly lower µmax (0.85 h −1) with respect to control cultures
supplemented with glutamate. Simultaneous supplementation
of glutamate, malate, and arginine had additive eﬀects on:
(i) attenuating extracellular acidity caused by lactic acid
accumulation (353.3 mM was produced 48 h after inoculum),
since pH at both time of growth arrest and after 48 h was the
highest observed among the growth conditions tested in this
study and (ii) increasing biomass formation up to 2.2 g L −1.
Growth arrest occurred 9 h after inoculum. At that time, while
malate had already been depleted, only 71.1 mM of glucose had
been consumed, leading to accumulation of 228.05 mM lactic
acid. The high amount of lactic acid observed in these conditions
could contribute to growth arrest for reasons independent from
acidiﬁcation.
The speciﬁc consumption rates for glucose and glutamine
were of the same order of magnitude of values measured
in control conditions ( Table 1 ). Speciﬁc malate consumption
rate was slightly lower than in the other malate-supplemented
cultures described above, while arginine was consumed at a
highest speciﬁc rate (14.58 mmol g−1 h−1, Table 1).
Finally, GABA was produced until a maximal concentration
of 5.22 mM at 48 h, which is higher than amounts accumulated
in glutamate- and glutamate-plusñmalate-supplemented
cultures but lower than those accumulated in glutamate-plusñ
arginine supplemented cultures. This data conﬁrmed that
arginine enhances while malate decreases GABA accumulation.
Interestingly, simultaneous glutamateñmalateñarginine supple-
mentation triggered an earlier production of GABA with
respect to all the other tested conditions: a concentration of
2.86 mM was already detected 12 h after inoculum and it
reached 4.28 mM at 24 h. This earlier production of GABA can
be observed in Figure 5 which combines the kinetics of the
diﬀerent experiments. When glutamate, arginine and malate
were contemporarily supplemented to L. lactis NCDO 2118
cultures, GABA production started at the beginning of the
exponential growth phase and at a pH as high as 6.6 while only
tardive GABA production in acidic conditions (pH < 5.1) was
observed in all other tested conditions.
DISCUSSION
Several systems can be activated or enhanced by LAB to
attenuate acidic environments and/or to improve metabolic
energy. If the most obvious strategy involves F0F1-ATPase, other
mechanisms such as the ADI pathway or the decarboxylation
of malate and amino acids can be used to neutralize or reduce
acidity (Budin-Verneuil et al., 2004). ADI pathway and malate
decarboxylation by MLF are often present in LAB which live
in wine ecological niche in which both malate and arginine
are abundant. In LAB, biogenic amine production (including
GABA biosynthesis) through amino acid decarboxylation usually

occurs in response to adverse conditions, e.g., as a mean to
counteract acidic environments (Van de Guchte et al., 2002)
and to obtain metabolic energy when the primary substrates
(e.g., glucose) are exhausted (Molenaar et al., 1993; Pessione
et al., 2010). However, little is known about the relative role
of the considered metabolic pathways in pH homeostasis,
their possible synergistic/antagonist eﬀects and consequences
on global metabolism and growth of LAB. In the present
study, the contribution of energy supplying/alkalinizing routes
(i.e., ADI pathway, malate fermentation and production of
GABA), to growth and metabolism of L. lactis NCDO 2118
and their reciprocal relationships was investigated. Eﬀects of
supplementation of diﬀerent amounts of substrates (arginine,
malate, and glutamate) or their mixtures on growth (speciﬁc
growth rate, ﬁnal biomass), substrate consumption and GABA
production have been quantitatively determined.
Growth Parameters
In all tested conditions, the growth proﬁle was characteristic
of L. lactis cultures, in which the growth rate was maximal in
the early phase and then progressively decreased. Growth arrest
was likely caused by low pH and/or lactic acid accumulation
in every condition considered here. The increase in ﬁnal
biomass seems inversely correlated to the pH decrease: the
higher the initial concentration of arginine or malate, the
higher was likely the activation of corresponding acid resistance
mechanisms (ADI pathway and MLF , respectively) resulting
in weaker and slower pH decrease, hence the growth could
be supported for longer time periods. It is worth noting that
while in arginine-supplemented cultures the pH acidiﬁcation
caused by lactic acid accumulation by glycolysis is neutralized
by release of ammonia, pH increase by MLF leads to additional
lactate production. It can be speculated that huge lactic acid
accumulation is likely the main growth inhibiting factor in

Laroute et al. GABA-Production Improvement in L. lactis
malate-supplemented cultures, for reasons independent from
medium acidiﬁcation. For instance, this could explain why
in cultures supplemented with 149 mM malate cell growth
stopped at lower ﬁnal biomass, i.e., 1.86 g L −1, and higher
pH, i.e., pH =5.76, with respect to cultures supplemented
with arginine. However, we cannot exclude that arginine and/or
malate stimulate biomass production by additional mechanisms
(other than homeostasis), such as production of biosynthetic
intermediates, for instance through malate conversion by malic
enzyme (ME; Landete et al., 2013) or arginine conversion to
pyrimidine precursors.
The maximal glucose consumption rate was similar in
all tested conditions, and the central metabolism remained
homolactic. From this macro-kinetic analysis, no evidence
that glycolytic ﬂux was aﬀected by alternative acid-resistance
related pathways could be inferred. This is in agreement
with the observation that the expression of two enzymes
of the central metabolism, namely phosphoglucomutase and
pyruvate dehydrogenase, was unaﬀected by arginine or malate
in L. hilgardii (Lamberti et al., 2011). The eﬃciency of arginine,
glutamate, and malate dissimilation pathways of L. lactis
NCDO 2118 was very diverse, as demonstrated by speciﬁc
substrate consumption rates. Malate was consumed at the
highest rate (maximal qmalate was comprised between 21.5 and
of 29.5 mmol g −1 h−1), followed by the arginine (maximal
qArg comprised between 1.2 and of 14.6 mmol g −1 h−1), and
ﬁnally by glutamate (maximal qGlu ≤ 0.2 mmol g −1 h−1).
These data suggest that MLF is the most rapid system
for neutralizing acidity in this strain. In fact, the slowest
acidiﬁcation was observed in cultures supplemented with malate.
Malate consumption rate seems negatively aﬀected by both
glutamate and arginine supplementation, suggesting that in these
conditions MLF is inhibited. It has been previously reported
that malate consumption was not aﬀected by histidine in
the culture medium in L. hilgardii ISE5211 (Mazzoli et al.,
2009; Lamberti et al., 2011). Similarly, ornithineñputrescine
conversion does not aﬀect MLF in Oenococcus oeni (Mangani
et al., 2005). Hence amino acid and malate decarboxylation
can be activated in parallel without reciprocal interference
in these two wine-isolated strains. This is not the case in
L. lactis NCDO 2118 in which also glutamate decarboxylation
is negatively aﬀected by malate suggesting that these routes are
competing. One possible explanation for this diﬀerent behavior
is that L. lactis NCDO 2118 has been isolated from another
ecological niche (frozen peas) and can be encountered in milk
fermentation. Arginine consumption rate is strongly inﬂuenced
by environmental conditions. Notably, both arginine and malate
supplementation increases maximal speciﬁc consumption rate of
arginine ( Table 1). These data suggest that both arginine and
malate may activate ADI pathway. The activation of ADI by
arginine has been previously described for many LAB species
(Manca de Nadra et al., 1988; Tonon et al., 2001; De Angelis
et al., 2002; Lamberti et al., 2011). However, positive regulation
of ADI by malate has never been reported so far. Proteomic
analyses showed that the expression of ADI pathway enzymes
is not aﬀected by malate in L. hilgardii (Lamberti et al., 2011).
Furthermore, malate inhibited arginine consumption in some
lactobacilli and pediococci isolated from wine (Araque et al.,
2011). However, Rallu et al. (1996) previously suggested that
lactic acid can activate arginine metabolism, including ADI
pathway, in L. lactis. We can hypothesize that malate is able to
enhance ADI pathway inL. lactis NCDO 2118 through additional
lactate production by MLF although a direct activation of this
pathway by malate cannot be excluded to be speciﬁc to the strain
considered in this study.
GABA Production
γ-aminobutyric acid production was clearly dependent on the
environmental conditions. In absence of glutamate, only low
amounts of GABA were produced likely as a consequence of
the conversion of glutamine (which is a CDM component) into
glutamate. The higher glutamate supplementation, the higher the
ﬁnal concentration of GABA (Figure 3A). However, relationship
between the amount of supplemented glutamate and produced
GABA is not linear but rather looks like a MichaelisñMenten
plot. Since glutamate amount did not aﬀect signiﬁcantly ﬁnal
biomass and growth rate, these data suggest that the same
amount of enzymes involved in glutamate/GABA conversion
(i.e., GAD and/or glutamate/GABA antiporters) were present
in all these conditions, i.e., glutamate did not improve their
biosynthesis. In these conditions, the system is semi-saturated
for glutamate concentrations of about 7 mM. The present
data therefore conﬁrm previous results obtained on L. lactis
NCDO2118 which indicated that glutamate supplementation
did not induce overexpression of GAD (Mazzoli et al.,
2010).
Arginine supplementation signiﬁcantly enhanced GABA
production in both absence or presence of glutamate
fortiﬁcation. The latter condition corresponds with the
production of the highest GABA amount observed in this
study (8.6 mM). It is possible to hypothesize that arginine
can replace glutamine/glutamate in some metabolic function,
allowing a higher proportion of these compounds to be directed
towards GABA production. For instance, it is well known that
in L. lactis glutamine can be converted to carbamoyl phosphate,
the building block for pyrimidine biosynthesis, by carbamoyl
phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.5.5) (Martinussen and Hammer,
1998). Since also arginine can generate carbamoyl phosphate
through the ADI pathway, it could replace glutamine allowing
it to be used for GABA biosynthesis. Similarly, arginine could
replace glutamate as amino group donor allowing higher
glutamate conversion to GABA.
An analysis of GABA production as a function of the pH of
the culture conﬁrmed the strong dependency of this metabolic
system on pH ( Figure 5 ). Signiﬁcant GABA production was
observed only at pH lower than 5.1 during stationary phase
(Figure 5), thus conﬁrming previous observations on the same
strain (Mazzoli et al., 2010). These data also agree with recent
studies reporting that acidic pH is necessary for activating
glutamate/GABA antiport by GadC (Lu et al., 2013; Tsai et al.,
2013). However, when glutamate, arginine and malate were
contemporarily supplemented to L. lactis NCDO 2118 cultures,
GABA production started at the beginning of the exponential
growth phase and at a pH as high as 6.6 (Figure 5). At pH 6.6, the

intracellular pH is estimated to be close to the neutrality (Even
et al., 2002) and is not compatible with the GAD activity that
was found to be highly inhibited above pH 5.4 in our bacteria
(results not shown). This suggests that another enzyme probably
ensures decarboxylation of glutamate in neutral conditions. As
far as we know, this is the ﬁrst evidence of signiﬁcant GABA
production during the exponential growth phase and at nearly
neutral pH. The biomass proﬁle could not explain this production
since it was similar to cultures supplemented with arginine
plus glutamate, where early activation did not occur. Since this
eﬀect was not observed when each of these three metabolites
was supplemented individually or as binary mixtures (glutamate
plus arginine or glutamate plus malate) it can be speculated
that the simultaneous activation of ADI pathway and MLF is
susceptible to activate GABA production, even at higher pH
and during exponential growth. Although more work is needed
to understand the biochemical basis of this phenomenon, this
observation could have signiﬁcant impact on industrial GABA
production process.
CONCLUSION
Acidic environments constitute a major stress for LAB which
developed several acid-counteracting systems which include ADI
pathway, MLF , and amino acid decarboxylation. Regulation
and reciprocal interactions of these pathways seem to vary
among microbial species. The present study indicated that
glutamate decarboxylation plays minor roles in L. lactis
NCDO 2118 physiology with respect to malate and arginine
dissimilation. In fact, glutamate supplementation had very
limited eﬀect in neutralizing acidity and in stimulating biomass
production in contrast to results obtained through malate and
arginine supplementation. Furthermore, GABA production was
restrained to narrower environmental conditions than malate
or arginine dissimilation, since both acidic pH (pH < 5.1)
and stationary phase were generally required for its activation.
However, this study indicated some strategies which enabled
activation of glutamate decarboxylation system outside of this
compass. Notably, arginine was able to strongly stimulate
GABA production, while simultaneous addition of arginine
and malate was able to trigger glutamate decarboxylation
in earlier growth phase (i.e., exponential phase) at near
neutral pH. Even if understanding the molecular basis of
these phenomena will require further studies, these results
are valuable tracks for developing more performant industrial
processes for enhanced and earlier GABA production through
fermentation.
