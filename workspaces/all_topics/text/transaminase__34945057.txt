Abstract: Chronic intermittent hypoxia leads to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension, which is
associated with high asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide
synthesis. Therefore, we aimed to understand the relation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in this
pathway to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH). We genotyped 69 healthy male Chileans
subjected to chronic intermittent hypoxia. Acclimatization to altitude was determined using the
Lake Louise Score and the presence of acute mountain sickness. Echocardiography was performed
after six months in 24 individuals to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure. The minor allele of
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)1 rs233112 was associated with high-baseline
plasma ADMA concentration, while individuals homozygous for the major allele of DDAH2 rs805304
had a signiﬁcantly greater increase in ADMA during chronic intermittent hypoxia. The major allele
of alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 (AGXT2) rs37369 was associated with a greater reduction
of plasma symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Several genes were associated with high-altitude
pulmonary hypertension, and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)3 and DDAH2 genes were related to
acute mountain sickness. In conclusion, DDAH1 determines baseline plasma ADMA, while DDAH2
modulates ADMA increase in hypoxia. AGXT2 may be up-regulated in hypoxia. Genomic variation
in the dimethylarginine pathway affects the development of HAPH and altitude acclimatization.

1. Introduction
Chronic exposure to global hypoxia, e.g., at high altitude, may cause generalized
hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension [ 1,2].
This pulmonary vasoconstriction is partly caused by diminished endothelium-dependent,
nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation, a molecular response that is in sharp contrast to
up-regulation of NO synthase in the systemic arterial endothelium in hypoxia [3–5].
We previously demonstrated that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endoge-
nous inhibitor of NO synthesis, is up-regulated in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH),
a condition affecting large numbers of individuals living at sea level and working at
high altitude, e.g., in the Chilean mining areas in the Andes [ 1]. These data are in line
with those derived from animal models of chronic hypoxia [6,7]. In a prospective study
among 123 healthy males, we showed that ADMA not only is elevated during six months
of chronic intermittent hypoxia, but also that elevated ADMA concentration at baseline is a
predictor of high-altitude pulmonary hypertension incidence [8].

ADMA is formed during post-translational protein methylation by protein arginine N-
methyltransferases (PRMTs) [9]. It is primarily metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethy-
laminohydrolases (DDAH1 and DDAH2); alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 (AGXT2)
also metabolizes ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) [10,11].
In humans, it is known that single nucleotide polymorphisms may affect both basal
expression of proteins and the transcriptional and translational response to environmental
stimuli. Multiple studies showed associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
NOS3 gene (that encodes for endothelial NOS) with vasospasm, hypertension, and cardio-
vascular death [12]. Polymorphisms in the NOS3, DDAH1, DDAH2, and AGXT2 genes
have previously been shown to relate to NO-mediated vascular function, hypertension,
and mortality in a range of different patient populations [13–15].
It was the objective of this study to assess whether genetic variation in the L-arginine—
dimethylarginine—NO pathway modulates the individual response to chronic intermittent
hypobaric hypoxia. Therefore, we selected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in NOS3,
DDAH1, DDAH2, AGXT2, ARG1, ARG2, and PRMT1 genes and studied their associa-
tions with dimethylarginine concentrations and the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary
hypertension as well as acclimatization to high altitude.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Participants and Protocol
Whole blood samples for DNA extraction were available from 69 healthy male Chilean
army draftees who had never been exposed to high altitude before, during exposure to six
months of chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia [8]. After the baseline investigation, the
study participants were followed during a regimen of ﬁve days at high altitude (3550 m)
followed by two days of recovery at sea level during six months. Written informed consent
was obtained from all study participants before the start of the study. This observational
study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile.
We extracted DNA from blood samples collected at baseline; venous blood samples
for the measurement of ADMA and SDMA concentrations were taken at baseline (sea
level) and at six months (high altitude). Haematocrit and haemoglobin were measured on
the day of blood withdrawal using an automatic haematological counter (Cell-dyn 3700®,
Tecnigen, Santiago, Chile). Blood was centrifuged and EDTA plasma kept frozen at−20 ◦C
until analysis of dimethylarginines. ADMA and SDMA were quantiﬁed using a validated
liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) [16].
Blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2) was measured with a pulse oximeter (POX050,
Mediaid®, Cerritos, CA, USA). Acute mountain sickness was diagnosed clinically when
headache and one or more other typical symptoms occurred (i.e., nausea or vomiting,
insomnia, dizziness, lassitude, or fatigue) and a Lake Louise Score [17] of >3 was achieved.
The level of acclimatization to high altitude was assessed by a combination of acute moun-
tain sickness and SaO2: Good acclimatization was deﬁned as absence of acute mountain
sickness plus SaO 2 > 89% and poor acclimatization was deﬁned as presence of acute
mountain sickness and/or SaO2 < 89%. After six months of chronic intermittent hypoxia,
echocardiography was performed at high altitude in a subgroup of 24 study participants
due to limited availability of technical resources [8]. Subjects undergoing echocardiography
were selected to comprise both individuals with good (n = 10) and with poor acclimatization
status (n = 14). A detailed description of the analysis of echocardiography measurements
was previously published [8]. An estimated mPAP ≥ 30 mm Hg was used to deﬁne the
presence of high-altitude pulmonary hypertension to account for the generally higher
pulmonary arterial pressure at high altitude, as recommended by Leon-Velarde et al. [18].
2.2. Selection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
Single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected based upon an extensive search in
the PubMed and NCBI SNP databases for publications linking single nucleotide polymor-
phisms in DDAH1, DDAH2, ARG1, ARG2, AGXT2, NOS3, and PRMT1 to endothelial

function, NO synthesis, and the vascular response to hypoxia. These genes code for the key
enzymes in the L-arginine—ADMA/SDMA—NO pathway (Figure 1) [ 4]. Subsequently, sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphisms in the same gene were tested for linkage disequilibrium us-
ing the LDLink database of the National Cancer Institute, USA (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/
(accessed on 20 November 2021)) [19], and the list of single nucleotide polymorphisms was
reduced to the best described one for this speciﬁc group when strong linkage disequilib-
rium was present; only polymorphisms that are not in strong linkage disequilibrium were
included in the analyses.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the L-arginine —dimethylarginine—nitric oxide pathway. 
L-arginine is the substrate for endothelial NO synthase and arginases, resulting in the formation of 
NO and L-citrulline or L-ornithine,  respectively. L-arginine residues within specific proteins are 
subject to methylation by protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs). After protein hydrolysis, 
asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylar ginine (SDMA) are re leased. ADMA is a 
competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase s (NOS). ADMA, but not SDMA, is degraded by 
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH1 and DDAH2) into L-citrulline and 
dimethylamine (DMA). Both dimethylarginines may be cleaved by an alternative pathway through 
alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), resulting in the formation of symmetric or 
asymmetric dimethylguanidinovaleric acid (DMGV and DM’GV). Genes in which single nucleotide 
polymorphisms were studied in the present study are highlighted in red. 
2.3. DNA Isolation from Whole Blood 
DNA from coagulated and centrifuged blood samples was isolated using QIAamp 
DNA Blood Mini Kit according to the manu facturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany). Centrifugation steps were performed at room temperature and 20,000× g. DNA 
was eluted in a total volume of 200 µL. Subsequently, DNA was precipitated by addition 
of 1/10 vol. 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 vol. absolute ethanol for further 
purification and concentration for SNP genotyping analyses. DNA was washed once with 
70 % ethanol and resuspended in 20 µL H20. DNA concentration was determined using a 
nanophotometer NP60 (Implen, Munich, Germany).  
2.4. Genotyping 
Genotyping of single nucleotide polymo rphisms was performed using single-tube 
human TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (T hermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Each 
reaction mix contained 10 ng template DNA, 0.5 µL specific TaqMan SNP Genotyping 
Assay and 5 µL of 2xTaqPath ProAmp™ Mastermix in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. 
The PCR was performed in a QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher,

5 µL of 2xTaqPath ProAmp™ Mastermix in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. The PCR
was performed in a QuantStudio ™ 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermoﬁsher, Waltham,
MA, USA) using the following PCR program: pre-read (30 s, 60 ◦C), enzyme activation
(5 min, 95 ◦C), 40 cycles of denaturation (5 s, 95 ◦C) and annealing (30 s, 60 ◦C), post-read
(30 s, 60 ◦C). Allelic calls were identiﬁed by Quant Studio Design and Analysis Software
(Thermoﬁsher, Waltham, MA, USA).

2.5. Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 21; IBM Corporation, Ar-
monk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism (version 6.01, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA). All variables were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test and for equal variances using the Levene test. Allele frequencies for the genes of
interest (GOI) were compared to the Mixed American reference population or between
groups using contingency tables and Fisher’s exact test. Deﬁnition of the major and minor
allele of each SNP was made according to the allele distribution of the Mixed American
reference population as given in the LDLink database [19]. Differences between groups
were tested using either the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for two groups or the
Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance for more than two groups. Plasma ADMA and SDMA
concentrations between genotypes were tested by ANOVA followed by the Scheffé f-test,
and associations between allele frequencies versus clinical outcome were tested by the χ2
test using adjustment for multiple testing by Bonferroni-Holm [ 20]. Data are presented
as median with 25th and 75th percentiles or as mean with standard error of the mean, as
appropriate. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline Characteristics
The cohort consisted of 69 healthy Chilean males aged 18.4 ± 1.5 years, for whom
complete data were available. Their physiological and biochemical baseline characteristics
and baseline biomarker levels (Table 1) did not signiﬁcantly differ from those of the
larger group of individuals that we described before [ 8]. After six months of chronic
intermittent hypoxia, haemoglobin and haematocrit consistently increased while SaO 2
decreased (Table 1). Baseline ADMA and SDMA concentrations at sea level were (median
(interquartile range)) 0.68 (0.60–0.75) µmol/L and 0.67 (0.59–0.75) µmol/L, respectively.
ADMA increased to 0.72 (0.62–0.78) µmol/L after six months of chronic intermittent
hypoxia (p = 0.024), while SDMA decreased to 0.58 (0.53–0.66) µmol/L (p = 0.008).

3.3. Association of Genotypes with Biomarker Concentrations
DDAH1 rs233112 and DDAH2 rs805304 genotypes were signiﬁcantly associated with
ADMA, and AGXT2 rs37369 genotypes were signiﬁcantly associated with SDMA concen-
tration. Individuals homozygous for the minor allele of DDAH1 rs2333112 had signiﬁcantly
higher median ADMA plasma concentrations, both at baseline and after six months of
chronic intermittent hypoxia; however, the increment in ADMA during chronic intermit-
tent hypoxia was not signiﬁcantly different between genotypes (Figure 2a). By contrast,
individuals homozygous for the major allele of DDAH2 rs805304 had a signiﬁcantly greater
increase in ADMA concentration after six months of chronic intermittent hypoxia, while
absolute plasma concentrations of ADMA did neither differ between genotypes at baseline
nor at 6 months (Figure 2b). SDMA plasma concentration showed a greater decrement after
six months of chronic intermittent hypoxia in individuals homozygous for the major allele
of AGXT2 rs37369, while median SDMA concentrations at baseline or six months did not
differ signiﬁcantly between genotypes (Figure 2c). There were no signiﬁcant associations
of any of the other genetic polymorphisms with these biomarkers.

3.3. Association of Genotypes with Biomarker Concentrations 
DDAH1 rs233112 and DDAH2 rs805304 genotypes were significantly associated with 
ADMA, and AGXT2 rs37369 genotypes were significantly associ ated with SDMA 
concentration. Individuals homozygous fo r the minor allele of DDAH1 rs2333112 had 
significantly higher median ADMA plasma concentrations, both at baseline and after six 
months of chronic intermittent hypoxia; however, the increment in ADMA during chronic 
intermittent hypoxia was not significantly different between genotypes (Figure 2a). By 
contrast, individuals homozygous for the major allele of DDAH2 rs805304 had a 
significantly greater increase in ADMA concentration after six months of chronic 
intermittent hypoxia, while absolute plasma  concentrations of ADMA did neither differ 
between genotypes at baseline nor at 6 months (Figure 2b). SDMA plasma concentration 
showed a greater decrement after six mont hs of chronic intermittent hypoxia in 
individuals homozygous for the major allele of AGXT2 rs37369, while median SDMA 
concentrations at baseline or six months di d not differ significantly between genotypes 
(Figure 2c). There were no significant associations of any of the other genetic 
polymorphisms with these biomarkers.

3.4. Association of Genotypes with High-Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension and Altitude 
Acclimatization 
We next tested the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with high-altitude 
pulmonary hypertension (n = 24) and with acclimatization status to high altitude (n = 69). 
We found four genes to be significantly associated with high-altitude pulmonary 
hypertension (i.e., estimated mPAP ≥ 30 mm Hg) after adjustment for multiple testing 
(Figure 3): NOS3 rs2070744 (p = 0.003), ARG2 rs3742879 (p = 0.003), DDAH1 rs233122 (p = 
0.004), and AGXT2 rs37369 ( p = 0.003). NOS3 rs891512 was significantly associated with 
acclimatization status of the study participants after six months of chronic intermittent 
hypoxia (p = 0.001). Likewise, this same NOS3 polymorphism was significantly associated 
with Lake Louise Score at month 6 (p = 0.005), while the two other NOS3 polymorphisms 
(rs1799983 and rs2070744) were not associated with Lake Louise Score at month 6 (p = ns). 
DDAH2 rs2272592 also showed a significant association with Lake Louise Score at month 
6 ( p = 0.024; Figure 4). Interestingly, none  of the single nucleotide polymorphisms 
analysed in this study was associated with Lake Louise Score at month 0, i.e., during first-
time exposure to altitude.

sion (i.e., estimated mPAP ≥ 30 mm Hg) after adjustment for multiple testing (Figure 3):
NOS3 rs2070744 (p = 0.003), ARG2 rs3742879 (p = 0.003), DDAH1 rs233122 (p = 0.004), and
AGXT2 rs37369 (p = 0.003). NOS3 rs891512 was signiﬁcantly associated with acclimati-
zation status of the study participants after six months of chronic intermittent hypoxia
(p = 0.001). Likewise, this same NOS3 polymorphism was signiﬁcantly associated with
Lake Louise Score at month 6 ( p = 0.005), while the two other NOS3 polymorphisms
(rs1799983 and rs2070744) were not associated with Lake Louise Score at month 6 (p = ns).
DDAH2 rs2272592 also showed a signiﬁcant association with Lake Louise Score at month 6
(p = 0.024; Figure 4). Interestingly, none of the single nucleotide polymorphisms analysed
in this study was associated with Lake Louise Score at month 0, i.e., during ﬁrst-time
exposure to altitude.

3.4. Association of Genotypes with High-Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension and Altitude 
Acclimatization 
We next tested the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with high-altitude 
pulmonary hypertension (n = 24) and with acclimatization status to high altitude (n = 69). 
We found four genes to be significantly associated with high-altitude pulmonary 
hypertension (i.e., estimated mPAP ≥ 30 mm Hg) after adjustment for multiple testing 
(Figure 3): NOS3 rs2070744 (p = 0.003), ARG2 rs3742879 (p = 0.003), DDAH1 rs233122 (p = 
0.004), and AGXT2 rs37369 ( p = 0.003). NOS3 rs891512 was significantly associated with 
acclimatization status of the study participants after six months of chronic intermittent 
hypoxia (p = 0.001). Likewise, this same NOS3 polymorphism was significantly associated 
with Lake Louise Score at month 6 (p = 0.005), while the two other NOS3 polymorphisms 
(rs1799983 and rs2070744) were not associated with Lake Louise Score at month 6 (p = ns). 
DDAH2 rs2272592 also showed a significant association with Lake Louise Score at month 
6 ( p = 0.024; Figure 4). Interestingly, none  of the single nucleotide polymorphisms 
analysed in this study was associated with Lake Louise Score at month 0, i.e., during first-
time exposure to altitude.

4. Discussion 
The present study has four major findings. First, single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
the DDAH1 gene are associated with baseline ADMA concentration. Secondly, the extent 
of increase of ADMA during chronic interm ittent hypoxia is associated with single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in the DDAH2 gene. Thirdly, we observed a significant 
decrease in SDMA concentration during ch ronic intermittent hy poxia in individuals 
homozygous for the major allele of AGXT2 rs37369, while carriers of one or two minor 
alleles had no significant change in SDMA co ncentration. Finally, there were multiple 
associations of genes of the L-arginin e—dimethylarginine—NO pathway with high-
altitude pulmonary hypertension and acute mountain sickness. 
We have previously observed an association between baseline ADMA concentration 
and incidence of high-altitude pulmonary hy pertension after six months of chronic 
intermittent hypoxia [8]. Furthermore, hy poxic pulmonary arterial endothelial cells 
showed lower DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA and protein expression, lower DDAH 
activity, and higher ADMA concentration than  normoxic cells [24]. In rats exposed to 
chronic hypobaric hypoxia, DDAH activity decreased and AD MA concentration in lung 
tissue increased [7]. However, DDAH1 knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia show 
the same extent of right ventricular hypertroph y as their wildtype littermates [6]. In line 
with this, single nucleotide polymorphism s in DDAH1 known to be associated with 
impaired DDAH activity showed significant associations with baseline ADMA 
concentration but not with the hypoxia-induced increase in ADMA in the present study.

4. Discussion
The present study has four major ﬁndings. First, single nucleotide polymorphisms of
the DDAH1 gene are associated with baseline ADMA concentration. Secondly, the extent of
increase of ADMA during chronic intermittent hypoxia is associated with single nucleotide
polymorphisms in the DDAH2 gene. Thirdly, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in SDMA
concentration during chronic intermittent hypoxia in individuals homozygous for the
major allele of AGXT2 rs37369, while carriers of one or two minor alleles had no signiﬁcant
change in SDMA concentration. Finally, there were multiple associations of genes of the
L-arginine—dimethylarginine—NO pathway with high-altitude pulmonary hypertension
and acute mountain sickness.
We have previously observed an association between baseline ADMA concentration
and incidence of high-altitude pulmonary hypertension after six months of chronic inter-
mittent hypoxia [8]. Furthermore, hypoxic pulmonary arterial endothelial cells showed
lower DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA and protein expression, lower DDAH activity, and
higher ADMA concentration than normoxic cells [24]. In rats exposed to chronic hypobaric
hypoxia, DDAH activity decreased and ADMA concentration in lung tissue increased [7].
However, DDAH1 knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia show the same extent of
right ventricular hypertrophy as their wildtype littermates [ 6]. In line with this, single
nucleotide polymorphisms in DDAH1 known to be associated with impaired DDAH activ-
ity showed signiﬁcant associations with baseline ADMA concentration but not with the
hypoxia-induced increase in ADMA in the present study.
We previously noted a gradual decrease in plasma SDMA concentration in individuals
exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia [ 8]. The major enzyme metabolizing SDMA is
AGXT2 [10]. We therefore speculate that AGXT2 expression and/or activity may be up-
regulated in chronic hypoxia, to compensate deﬁcient DDAH activity. This mechanism
would limit the elevation of ADMA in hypoxia, and it could explain the observed decrement
in SDMA concentration during hypoxia. The present data further support this hypothesis
by showing that the reduction of SDMA was limited to carriers of the major allele of
AGXT2 rs37369, while heterozygous individuals or those homozygous for the minor allele
experienced no decrease in SDMA. The minor allele of this genetic polymorphisms has
previously been associated with a reduced AGXT2 activity [25,26]. We therefore propose
that AGXT2 is up-regulated in hypoxia, which, however, does not lead to enhanced
enzymatic activity in carriers of the minor allele.
The role of DDAH2 in ADMA metabolism has remained more controversial than
that of DDAH1. DDAH2 is mainly expressed in cells co-expressing endothelial NO
synthase, i.e., heart, placenta, kidneys, and lungs [ 27]. Knockdown of DDAH2 in rats
impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation but did not change circulating ADMA con-
centration [28]. Likewise, genetic deletion of DDAH2 in mice causes elevated ADMA
concentration in myocardium and kidneys but no change in circulating ADMA, im-
paired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and elevated systolic blood
pressure [29]. The DDAH2 SNP that we analysed is located 1151 base pairs upstream of the
translational start site of the DDAH2 gene, raising the possibility that it may affect promoter
binding. Maas and co-workers [14] genotyped 783 individuals from a population-based
cohort for SNPs in DDAH1 and DDAH2 and reported that DDAH2 rs805304 was not
associated with baseline circulating ADMA, but that homozygous carriers of the major
allele had an odds ratio of 1.70 (1.22–2.36) for the presence of hypertension.
Taken together, the present data in combination with previous studies suggest that
presence of the major or minor allele of this genetic polymorphism determines regulation
of DDAH2 gene expression in hypoxia and other pathophysiological conditions, while
not affecting baseline ADMA plasma concentration. In line with this, we recently ob-
served compensatory up-regulation of DDAH2 mRNA and protein expression in DDAH1
knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia [6].
The present study provides additional evidence to support a functional role of the
L-arginine—dimethylarginine—NO pathway in the pathophysiology of health conse-
J. Clin. Med.2021, 10, 5761 9 of 11
quences arising from exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia. A variety of single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms in genes relating to nitric oxide bioavailability were signiﬁcantly
associated with high-altitude pulmonary hypertension. These data support a role of the
L-arginine—dimethylarginine—NO pathway in the long-term adaptation to repetitive
exposure towards high altitude, in line with previous reports comparing yaks with cat-
tle [30] and lama with sheep [31]. Persistent high-altitude pulmonary hypertension during
chronic hypoxia and, importantly, also during chronic intermittent hypoxia, may lead to
serious health consequences by causing right ventricular hypertrophy and, ﬁnally, right
heart failure [1].
The present study was performed in young Chilean males undergoing military ser-
vice after ethical approval and individual informed consent was obtained. None of the
study participants was exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia solely for purposes of
this study; rather, the study participants were observed at regular intervals during their
daily and weekly routines with no interventions except for venous blood sampling, health
questionnaires, and echocardiography after six months in a subgroup. This cohort offered
the advantage that additional health hazards impacting on mining workers at high altitude
(e.g., dust, heavy physical work) did not affect participants of this study. Furthermore, the
investigated cohort was naïve to high altitude.
Our study has several limitations. It is limited to young Chilean men with a high
prevalence of obesity and smoking; therefore, we cannot extrapolate our data to elderly
individuals with pulmonary diseases or to the general population. The relatively small
sample size must be considered in cautiously interpreting associations of the minor alleles
with clinical status. Additional molecular analyses will be required to further elucidate the
exact mechanisms underlying this regulation, the speciﬁc transcription factors involved,
and the molecular signalling pathways linking hypoxia to the observed changes in the
L-arginine—dimethylarginine—NO pathway. Furthermore, in this study mean pulmonary
arterial pressure was estimated using echocardiography with its inherent, well-recognized
limitations. Although high-altitude experts generally agree with the deﬁnition of high-
altitude pulmonary hypertension used in this study [18], it deviates from the general cut-off
value for pulmonary arterial pressure deﬁning pulmonary arterial hypertension (≥20 mm
Hg) [32]; an evidence-based, revised deﬁnition of pulmonary hypertension at high altitude
is clearly needed to better deﬁne this condition and the pathophysiology related to it [33].
Finally, we suppose that single nucleotide polymorphisms analysed in this study directly
or indirectly interfere with nitric oxide metabolism; however, we have not measured nitric
oxide metabolites in plasma and therefore cannot prove this.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provides genetic evidence for differential roles of the three en-
zymes involved in dimethylarginine metabolism during exposure to chronic hypoxia.
Taken together with previous observations, the present data support the notion that
DDAH1 is the major enzyme metabolizing ADMA in physiological conditions, while
both DDAH2 and AGXT2 are regulated in conditions in which DDAH1 expression and/or
activity is impaired, therefore playing important roles in back-up enzymatic pathways for
ADMA degradation.
