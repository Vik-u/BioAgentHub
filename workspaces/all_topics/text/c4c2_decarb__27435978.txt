tradeoff between growth rate and biomass
yield in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

Abstract
Background: Two variants of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 demonstrated a trade-off between growth rate and
biomass yield. In addition, growth rate and biomass yield were also affected by supplementation of growth medium
with different amounts of cobalt. The metabolism changes relating to these growth phenomena as well as the
trade-off were investigated in this study. 13C metabolic flux analysis was used to generate a detailed central carbon
metabolic flux map with both absolute and normalized flux values.
Results: The major differences between the two variants occurred at the formate node as well as within C3 –C4
inter-conversion pathways. Higher relative fluxes through formyltetrahydrofolate ligase, phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase, and malic enzyme led to higher biomass yield, while higher relative fluxes through pyruvate kinase and
pyruvate dehydrogenase led to higher growth rate. These results were then tested by phenotypic studies on three
mutants (null pyk,n u l l pck mutant and null dme mutant) in both variants, which agreed with the model prediction.
Conclusions: In this study, 13C metabolic flux analysis for two strain variants of M. extorquens AM1 successfully
identified metabolic pathways contributing to the trade-off between cell growth and biomass yield. Phenotypic
analysis of mutants deficient in corresponding genes supported the conclusion that C3 –C4 inter-conversion strategies
were the major response to the trade-off.

Background
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 is a facultative α-
proteobacterial methylotroph, that has been studied
intensively over 50 years [1]. The availability of the
genome sequence for M. extorquens AM1 [2]. intensive
developments of genetic tools [3, 4], and well-studied
biochemistry and physiology have made the organism a
model system for C1 metabolism. With the development
of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and fluxo-
mics, studies on C1 metabolism in M. extorquens AM1
have recently been carried out using system approaches
[5– 7]. C1 metabolism involves multiple C1-specific meta-
bolic pathways, including the tetrahydromethanopterin-
dependent oxidation pathway, the serine cycle, and the
ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway as shown in Fig. 1.
Recent studies have shown that cobalt is an important
trace metal for methylotrophic growth in M. extorquens
AM1. Cobalt is needed for vitamin B 12 production
used as cofactor for two enzymes involved in methy-
lotrophy growth, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Mcm) and
ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Ecm) in the ethylmalonyl-CoA
pathway, and plays a role in strain fitness [8, 9, 11]. Three
research groups have published optimized media recipes,
including optimization of cobalt levels [8 – 11]. However,
the effect of cobalt on the overall central carbon metabol-
ism in M. extorquens AM1 remains unknown.
Strain integrity can become compromised when the
same strain is transferred between labs using different
storage procedures, as illustrated recently for M. extor-
quens AM1 [12]. Phenotypic divergence was observed be-
tween an archival strain and a modern strain in terms of
growth rate and fitness across various culture conditions

verged in Mary Lidstrom ’s lab and Julia Vorholt ’sl a b ,a f t e r
these strains were separated for 14 years. Different growth
rates were reported from previous studies for both strains
[13, 14], which could be ascribed to a combination of
culturing environment and unintended domestication of
the M. extorquens AM1 strain, but the basis for this differ-
ence is not known.
It has been well-documented that a trade-off exists
between rate and yield for heterotrophic organisms in
which growth rate is predicted to be limited by ATP
[15, 16]. However, it was not known whether such a
tradeoff occurs in the M. extorquens AM1 strain
variants. In M. extorquens AM1, the cell growth is
predicted to be limited by reducing power instead of
ATP [13], making the metabolic basis for such trade-
offs unclear. The availability of two strain variants
with differences in growth rate and possibly in
biomass yield offers an opportunity to decipher
system-wide metabolic responses in M. extorquens
AM1, including the possible trade-off between growth
rate and biomass yield.
13C metabolic flux analysis is a powerful tool, which
combines both experimental and computational ap-
proaches to quantitatively understand the metabolic
pathways in a living organism. It is based on a stoichio-
metric reaction model and extracellular consumption
and secretion, along with 13C labeling information to
calculate in vivo reaction rates [17 – 21]. It generates both
flux maps with absolute values as well as flux distribu-
tion normalized to specific substrate uptake rate, offer-
ing insights into cell behavior at the metabolic activity
level. This technique provides an approach to address
the metabolic changes underlying the physiological
differences observed in the two M. extorquens strain
variants noted above.
In this study, it was established that a tradeoff exists
between growth rate and biomass yield in these two M.

dehydrogenase. The other part is converted into methylene H 4Fv i at h eH 4F pathway, entering the serine cycle. The serine cycle is the main
assimilation pathway, with the EMC pathway regenerating glyoxylate in an anaplerotic function. Portions of the TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis,

order to assess the metabolic differences underlying the
trade-off. In addition, MFA was applied to the same
strain with different cobalt supplements to assess the
effect of cobalt on overall central carbon metabolism
and its contribution to the trade-off.
Results
Tradeoff between growth rate and biomass yield exists in
M. Extorquens AM1 for two strain variants as well as two
cobalt levels
Observations of growth rate differences prompted a
more in-depth study of two M. extorquens AM1 strains,
a parent strain from the laboratory of Mary Lidstrom
(LL strain), and a strain that originated from the
Lidstrom laboratory, but was carried in the laboratory of
Julia Vorholt (VL strain) since 2001. Both genomes of
the two variants were sequenced in this study. A small
number of genomic differences were detected between
three different M. extorquens strains (VL, LL and Chris
Marx modern strain [22]) (see Additional file 1: Table S1).
However, these differences did not provide an obvious
solution to the trade-off or suggest how the divergence in
genome sequence affects growth rate. Growth experi-
ments were conducted for the two strains with methanol
as the sole carbon substrate. A minimal medium from the
Lidstrom laboratory (called hypho medium, HY) was used
to be consistent with previous work done in the Lidstrom
laboratory. In addition, since levels of cobalt in the
medium also affect growth rate of M. extorquens AM1
strains [8, 9] but the effect on biomass yield is
unknown, this factor was also studied. Three different
levels of cobalt were tested for growth rate experi-
ments (data not shown). For both strains, the most
dramatic differences were between 1.35 and 6.31 μM.
These two concentrations were then chosen to test
the effect of cobalt supplementation.
Biomass yield on methanol, which was defined as g
cell dry weight generated per mol methanol consump-
tion, was monitored by measuring methanol concentra-
tion in supernatant and biomass concentration during
log phase (at least two time points were taken during log
phase). Excretion products were tested in culture super-
natant and were found to be negligible. A negative
correlation between growth rate and biomass yield was
observed, with both strain difference and cobalt level
playing a role in the trade-off. As shown in Fig. 2, the
VL strain grew 22 % faster than the LL strain in the
presence of 1.35 μM cobalt (normal HY medium), and
similarly, 21 % faster in medium with 6.31 μM cobalt
(termed HYC medium). However, biomass yield shows
the opposite trend. The biomass yield of was 28 % lower
than that of the LL strain in both HY and HYC. A
similar trade-off was also observed for the same strain
growing in medium with different cobalt levels. The LL
strain grew 26 % faster but with 32 % lower biomass
yield in HYC medium than in HY medium, while the VL
strain grew 25 % faster with 28 % lower biomass yield in
HYC than HY.

In summary, within the four conditions tested in this
study, LL in HY medium has the slowest growth rate
but highest biomass yield while VL in HYC medium has
the fastest growth rate but lowest biomass yield. Since
both strain difference and cobalt level were taken into
account in this set of comparisons, analysis of the meta-
bolic response to the trade-off includes both factors.
Flux distribution reveals different metabolic strategies in
C3– C4 interconversions and the formate branch node
In order to assess metabolic differences between the two
strains, detailed central carbon flux maps were generated
for each strain to provide a quantitative description for
the two growth conditions using 13C metabolic flux
analysis ( 13C-MFA). The published flux balance model
and biomass composition for the VL strain [13] was used
as a basis for a model developed in Influx_s. The specific
methanol uptake rate of cells was measured in exponen-
tial phase, and an analysis of extracellular metabolites
for cells grown in the same way showed negligible
amounts. The model consists of 114 reactions including
9 reversible reactions and 2 scrambling reactions. A total
of 149 MS measurements were used for model fitting
with 12 calculated label measurements. The simulated
flux data were then normalized to a specific methanol
uptake rate to generate the flux distribution map for
each condition. The flux distribution comparison shown
in Fig. 3 indicates the major differences were in the
formate branch point and in C3-C4 interconversion
pathways. As shown in the central carbon metabolism
map, formate could either be oxidized to CO 2 by
formate dehydrogenase (FDH) or be converted into
formyl-H4F by formyltetrahydrofolate ligase (FTHFL).
As expected by the growth rate difference, the absolute

methanol uptake rate and flux through formate to both
branches was higher for the VL strain than the LL strain
(see Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Table S2, S3, S4 and
S5). However, the flux distribution across the branch
point, which is normalized to the methanol uptake rate,
shows a strain-specific difference in keeping with the
higher biomass yield for the LL strain. For the LL strain,
FTHFL carries 36 % more flux entering the assimilation
pathway than the VL strain in HY, 28 % more in HYC.
Likewise, two routes exist for conversion of phospho-
enolpyruvate (PEP) into acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). In the first
route, the classic serine cycle involves conversion of PEP
into oxaloacetate (OAA) through a carboxylation
pathway involving PEP carboxylase (PEPCL), and then
conversion of OAA into malate (MAL) by malate de-
hydrogenase (MDH), which is then further converted
into glyoxylate and AcCoA by malyl-coA lyase (MCL). A
reaction also exists to decarboxylate OAA back to PEP
by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). An
alternative route utilizes PEP to synthesize pyruvate
through pyruvate kinase (PK), and then pyruvate is
decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PYRDH) to
produce AcCoA. Pyruvate could also be produced from
decarboxylation of malate through malic enzyme (ME).
The flux distribution shows that PEPCL had a higher
normalized flux in the LL strain than the VL strain by
91 % in HY and by 55 % in HYC. For each strain grown
at different cobalt concentrations, the normalized
PEPCL flux decreased by 53 % at the higher cobalt con-
centration in HYC for the LL strain and 42 % for the VL
strain. PEPCK is active for the LL strain in HY, but is
negligible for the LL strain in HYC. For the VL strain,
PEPCK is negligible regardless of the level of cobalt. For
the malic enzyme pathway (ME), the LL strain has 97 %
higher flux than the VL strain in HY, but the difference
became smaller in HYC, with the higher cobalt concen-
tration. PK in the LL strain is 49 % lower than VL in HY
with the lower cobalt level, 25 % in HYC. A similar trend
was observed for PYRDH for both conditions but to
different extents, 67 and 61 % respectively.
Phenotypic differences of mutants
Based on the flux analysis results, three genes were
targeted for mutation ( dme encoding ME, pck encoding
PEPCK and pyk encoding PK), to assess mutant pheno-
types in the two strains. It is known that PEPCL, MCL,
and MDH are required for growth on methanol [23] so
those mutants were not generated.
From the metabolic flux distribution result, the following
phenotypes were predicted. The growth rate was associated
with the PYK pathway encoded by pyk. Conditions with
faster growth have higher flux through PYK. The pyk
mutant should have higher negative impact on growth rate
for the VL strain under both medium conditions, while for
the LL strain the impact should be minor. The growth rate
experiments on pyk mutants agree with this prediction. As
s h o w ni nT a b l e1 ,f o rH Ym e d i u m ,L L :Δpyk shows similar
growth as LL, while VL: Δpyk has 56 % slower growth rate
than VL. For HYC medium, LL: Δpyk shows a 13 % growth
defect compared to LL under the same condition, while
VL: Δpyk h a sa3 6%s l o w e rg r o w t hr a t et h a nV Lu n d e rt h e
same condition. The metabolic flux distributions can only
predict the impact of this mutation on growth rate, but it
is also of interest to assess impact on yield. The biomass
yield of LL: Δpyk and VL: Δpyk showed minor changes in
HY medium, while in HYC medium, biomass yield
increased slightly for both strains. This suggests that in the
Δpyk mutant, the route of the standard serine cycle with
PEPCL, MDH and ME carries more flux than in the ori-
ginal strain, which can lead to higher biomass yield.
Secondly, metabolic flux map results also indicate that
the non-essential pathways associated with biomass yield
were ME encoded by dme and PEPCK encoded by pck.
The higher biomass yield conditions have higher carbon
flux through both ME and PEPCK. This predicts that
both of these mutants should have a more negative
impact on conditions with higher biomass yield. The
experimental results on biomass yield for these two
mutants agree with the prediction shown in Table 1. As
shown in Table 1, the dme mutation had a negative
effect on biomass yield in the LL strain in HY medium
(54 % decrease) compared to wild type LL. A smaller
decrease in biomass yield (28 %) occurred in VL: Δdme.
Likewise, the pck mutation also had a negative impact
on biomass yield in the LL strain (46 % decrease com-
pared to wild type LL), while for VL: Δpck in HY, it de-
creased by only 18 %. The effect on biomass yield for
both strains was less when the cells were grown with the
higher level of cobalt. For both VL: Δdme and VL: Δpck,
the biomass yield increased. Noticeably, the dme mutant
in VL and LL strain had the same biomass yield in HYC
when extra cobalt was supplied to the medium, while
the difference was more pronounced in HY medium.
The Δpck and Δdme strains did not have large impacts
on growth rate, but showed different extents of growth
defects (Table 1). These two pathways involve NADH
and ATP consumption, respectively. Therefore these two
mutants are expected to alter consumption of ATP and
NADH, which might be expected to affect growth rate.
Discussion
This work generated four detailed flux distribution maps
for two strain variants of M. extorquens AM1 (the LL
and VL strains) grown with different cobalt levels. 13C
MFA has previously been applied to the VL strain during
growth on methanol at a higher cobalt level [13]. How-
ever, it is not possible to compare the flux maps directly,
as in the previous study the culture was grown with 5 %

CO2 purging the culture system. The influence of 5 %
CO2 on metabolism in M. extorquens AM1 is unknown,
but given the number of carboxylation and decarboxyl-
ation reactions involved in growth on one-carbon
compounds, it might alter fluxes. In this study we used
air (0.5 % CO 2) and also a slightly different medium
recipe, to allow direct comparisons with previous
metabolic studies of this bacterium carried out in this
medium with 0.5 % CO 2.
We have shown that the VL strain grew faster with
lower biomass yield than the LL strain, regardless of the
cobalt supplementation. From these results we conclude
that a tradeoff exists between growth rate and biomass
yield that is strain-specific. This suggests that these two
strains are an example of unintended domestication,
which has been reported previously for M. extorquens
AM1 [12]. In addition, the cobalt level also affects
growth rate and biomass yield in a manner that is not
strain-specific. Improved growth rate and increased
absolute fluxes through the EMC cycle in response to
higher cobalt are in keeping with previous studies [8,
11] suggesting that the EMC pathway could be a po-
tential bottleneck for methanol assimilation under co-
balt limitation conditions.
The occurrence of natural strain variants with growth
rate/biomass yield tradeoffs along with the cobalt affect
provided the opportunity to determine features of
metabolic network response underlying these major
physiological attributes of growth rate and biomass yield.
13C-flux labeling revealed that FTHFL, the pathway
involving the standard serine cycle (PEPCL, MDH, and
MCL), and PEPCK and ME all had higher relative flux
in conditions when biomass yield was higher, while the
alternate pathway to AcCoA involving PK and PYRDH
had higher relative flux in conditions when growth rate
was faster. These differences were predicted to affect
NADH and ATP usage. PEPCK consumes one ATP ,
while PK and PYRDH produce one ATP and one
NADH, respectively. MDH and MCL consume NADH
and ATP, respectively. These results suggest that higher
biomass yield is achieved under conditions that result in
relatively higher relative fluxes through the standard
serine cycle-based carbon assimilation pathways, even
though this metabolic scheme consumes more NADH
and ATP than the one involving conversion of pyruvate
to AcCoA, at the expense of growth rate. Likewise,
higher growth rate is achieved by diverting carbon
through pathways with higher NADH and ATP produc-
tion, with concomitant decrease in biomass yield.
There must be a genetic explanation for the trade-off.
However, genome sequence results did not provide a
clear clue, since none of the genomic changes is
predicted to directly impact any of the C3/C4 reactions
that show altered flux. One of the possible explanations
is that the mutants in the gene cluster with unknown
functions lead to shifted flux through C3/C4 enzymes
due to the change in small molecule pools, which in
turn affects yield versus growth rate.
The results of mutant phenotypes are consistent with
these conclusions regarding metabolic network response,

since loss of the biomass yield-related enzymes resulted
in an impact on biomass yield, and loss of a growth-rate
related enzyme resulted in an impact on growth rate. It
is more difficult to predict the impact of the pyk mutant
on yield, and of the dme and pck mutants on growth
rate. C3-C4 interconversion pathways in this bacterium
are flexible due to the fact that some of the enzymes are
reversible (such as MDH, ME) as well as the fact that
different enzymes are present that catalyze forward and
reverse reactions (such as PK, PEP synthase, PEPCL and
PEPCK). In the two strain variants, two C3/C4 pathways
dominate but with different ratios, as shown in Fig. 3, but
we do not know how the network will change in the mu-
tants. Therefore, although we can predict that removing
the optimal variant would decrease growth rate or yield,
respectively, the mutation may or may not also affect the
other parameter, depending on how the metabolic net-
work rearranges.
The cobalt concentration used in the growth medium
also affected the fluxes and mutant phenotypes. In both
strains, growth in higher cobalt resulted in higher
growth rates and a correspondingly higher absolute flux
through the assimilatory pathways. Since the EMC path-
way contains two steps requiring B 12-utilizing mutases
(ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase), it is expected that higher availability of cobalt
would affect flux through the EMC shown by others
[8, 11]. The increased absolute flux through the EMC
suggests that a cobalt-related component of one or
both of these enzymes might limit flux under the
lower cobalt growth condition. However, although the
absolute flux increased through all of the central as-
similatory pathways with increased cobalt, the flux
distribution (normalized to the methanol uptake rate)
did not. The flux distribution through the EMC was es-
sentially the same for both the high and low cobalt condi-
tions. This result suggests that the assimilatory flux is well
balanced with both the methanol uptake rate and the
formate branchpoint distribution, and that the metabolic
network has the capacity to increase flux to this level. The
significant changes in the flux distribution that occur in
response to cobalt are not in the EMC pathway, but in-
stead, are in the nexus between the serine cycle, the partial
TCA cycle, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the EMC
pathway. It seems likely that this redundancy in C3 – C4
interconversions at this metabolic intersection provides
robustness for the metabolic network. The mechanism(s)
for these changes are not yet known, but could occur at
the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.
The flux distribution maps presented here provide
information that is potentially useful in guiding strain
development for biotechnical applications. For applica-
tions in which faster strain growth is favored to create
optimal economic conditions for a product (for instance,
when a biomass product is the target), reactions identi-
fied in this study associated with faster growth are
targets for manipulation. Similarly, if instead higher
biomass yield is favored, for instance with an excreted
product, the reactions associated with higher biomass
yield could be manipulation targets. It should also be
noted that as shown in this study, a single trace mineral
change in the medium changes the flux distribution,
pointing out the importance of flux analysis in assessing
metabolic dynamics and growth conditions.
Conclusion
Growth rate and biomass yield measurements for two
culture conditions with two strain variants suggest
trade-offs exist between growth rate and biomass yield.
13C flux analysis was successfully applied to identify
metabolic differences that could contribute to the trade-
off. Pathways with different activities were identified,
which were used to generate a hypothesis of the meta-
bolic changes responding to the trade-off, focused on
C3– C4 inter-conversion strategies. The hypothesis was
tested using mutants, and their phenotypes supported
the conclusion that the flux difference mainly involves
C3– C4 interconversion strategies.
Methods
Chemicals and medium composition
13C methanol of 99 % purity was purchased from
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA). All
other chemicals including metabolite standards were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Phusion
DNA polymerase, dNTP , buffer, ligases, OneTaq Quick-
Load 2X Master Mix and the Gibson Assembly Master
Mix kits used in this study were from New England
Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Primers, the sequences of which
are shown in Table 1, were obtained from Invitrogen
(Grand Island, NY) and IDT (Coralville, IA). Acetonitrile
and water used as UPLC solvents were UPLC-MS grade.
Hypho minimal medium as previously described [24]
was used for 13C flux analysis cell culture and growth
rate determination, involving two different concentra-
tions of cobalt (1.35 and 6.31 μM respectively).
Bacterial strains, plasmid and growth condition
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. Escherichia
coli strains Top 10 and S17-1 were cultivated at 37 °C in
Luria-Bertani medium. Two wild type M. extorquens AM1
strain were used, in which VL is from the Julia Vorholt lab
and LL is from the Mary Lidstrom lab. Plasmid pCM184
was used as template for backbone and cre-kan amplifica-
tion. A Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA) was used for plasmid construction to create
knock out strains with a kanamycin marker FYF1, FYF2,
FYF3 and FYF4, (primer sequences shown in Table 3).

Insertion mutants of pyk were generated for both LL and
VL variants as described earlier [25] because of our inabil-
ity to obtain clean knockout using the method described
in this study. 125 mM methanol was used as the sole
carbon source for cell culture and growth curves. For 13C
flux analysis, 13C methanol was introduced at the stage of
3 ml seed culture in tubes, and then inoculated into flasks
with screw caps in a dilution ratio of 1:200 in triplicates.
Cell culture was then quenched using fast filtration and li-
quid nitrogen after the cell reaches OD 600 around 0.6– 0.8
(7 generations). For normal growth curve cell culture,
methanol was added as carbon source in 3 ml seed cul-
ture, and then inoculated into flasks with screw caps with
the same dilution ratio.
Methanol measurements in supernatant
Methanol consumption rates were determined by taking
time course samples for supernatant methanol measure-
ments. At least 2 points were taken during exponential
phase growth. 750 ul of the supernatant sample were
centrifuge filtered through 0.22 μm centrifuge filters (Co-
star® Spin-X® centrifuge tube filters, cellulose acetate
membrane, pore size 0.22 μm, non-sterile, Sigma-Aldrich,
(St. Louis, MO) for 2 min at 14,000 rpm. GC-FID (Aglient,
Santa Clara, CA) was used for methanol detection with a
6890 Gas Chromatograph equipped with flame ionization
detector (FID). Data were collected and converted into
matlab input files with LabVIEW 2010. Data analysis
was later done in Matlab. SLB-IL60 column (Supelco,
Bellefonte, PA, USA) with a 30 m × 0.25 mm inner
diameter (i.d.) × 0.2 μmt h i c k n e s sw a si n s t a l l e df o rg a s
chromatograms. 1 μl of supernatant was injected and
separated in the column and then entering into FID
detector with a split ratio 50:1. Oven temperatures were
programmed as follows. An initial temperature of 120 °C
was held for 1 min, and then ramped at 35 °C /min until a
final temperature of 200 °C was achieved. The FID was
operated at 220 °C. All measurements were done in tripli-
cate. With each run, a new calibration curve was then
generated using the same instrument setting.
Metabolite extraction and biomass hydrolysis for
isotopomer distribution measurements
Both proteinogenic amino acids and intracellular metab-
olites were used for isotopomer measurements in order
to obtain good coverage of central carbon metabolism
under methylotrophic growth. 20 ml of cell culture were
collected and quenched using fast filtration using 0.2 μm
nylon membrane filters (0.2 μm, 47 mm from PALL life
science, Port Washington, NY) and liquid nitrogen. Cell
pellets on 0.22 μm filters were lyophilized using
FreeZone 4.5 l benchtop freezedry system (Labconco,
Kansas) for 8 – 12 h to remove medium residue. The
filter was incubated in 20 ml of boiling water for 10 min,
and then placed on ice for at least 20 min for protein
precipitation. The whole broth was then centrifuged at
4 °C, 5000 rpm for 10 min. The clear supernatant was
transferred into a clean 50 ml falcon tube, and then
frozen using liquid nitrogen. The remaining tubes
containing protein and cell debris were centrifuged

again, at 4 °C, 5000 rpm for 20 min, and supernatants
were removed carefully. Frozen samples were then ly-
ophilized twice, and reconstituted in 100 μl nanopure
water. The 100 μl of sample was distributed into 2 vials.
One 50 μl sample was used for LC/MS/MS measure-
ments, and the other was dried using a Speedvac
(Labconco, Kansas), and derivatized with TBDMS and
methoxyamine hydrochloride O-Methylhydroxylamin-
hydrochlorid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a
previously described method [20]. Cell pellets were then
hydrolyzed using 1 ml of 6 N HCl at 105 °C for 22 – 24 h.
The remaining HCl was later evaporated with nitrogen
flow. Dried samples were reconstituted in 500 μl nano-
pure water, and ash and cell debris were then filtered
out of the sample using centrifuge tube filter (spin-x co-
star, 0.22 μm, Sigma-Aldrich). 50 μl of the reconstituted
sample was then dried and derivatized using TBDMS as
noted above.
Both TBDMS-derivatized proteinogenic amino acids
and intracellular metabolites were detected using an
Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) GCMS with an Agilent J&W
HP-5 ms Ultra Inert GC Column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×
0.25 μm, catalog number: 19091 s-433). Each sample
was run in duplicate on the GCMS with the same
temperature program, and also as one more run with a
slower oven temperature ramping rate. The oven
temperature was programmed as follows: for regular
runs, the oven temperature was programmed as follows:,
initial temperature at 100 °C, hold for 4 min, then ramp
to 300 °C with ramp rate at 5 °C/min, then hold for
5 min, with total run time 49 min. In order to further
separate compounds with similar retention times a
slower run was developed. For the slower run, the ramp
rate slows down to 2.5 °C/min with total run 89 min.
MS source temperature was set at 230 °C and MS quad
temperature set as150 °C.
Sugar phosphate was separated by a Zic-pHilic column
(SeQuant, PEEK 150 mm length × 2.1 mm metal free,
with 5 μm polymeric film thickness) using LC-MS/MS
(Xevo, Waters, Milford, MA). Mobile phase A is LC grade
water with 2 mM formic acid and 4 mM ammonium, mo-
bile phase B is acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid. Column
temperature was set at 30 °C. The LC condition starts with
0.15 ml/min flow rate with initial gradient A = 15 %, hold
for 2 min, then increased to 40 % over the next 2 min. At
7 min, A = 50 %, at 10 min, A = 80 %, at 11 min, A is set
to 90 %, held for 0.5 min, and then switched to 15 % at
11.50 min to re-equilibrate the column for another
4.5 min.
Waters Xevo G2-S Q-Tof equipped with Waters
Acquity UPLC I class (Milford, MA) was used for some
of the proteinogenic amino acids using HILIC-BEH-
amide (Waters Acquity, part number 186004802, with
dimension 2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.7um). Mobile phase A is
water with 20 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic
acid, mobile phase B is acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic
acid. LC solvent gradient was set as follow, starting at
10 % A for 1 min, at 2 min, A = 35 %, at 3 min, A =
40 %, at 6 min, A = 50 %, at 7.5 min, A = 80 %, holding
for another 2 min. Then the column is re-equilibrated at
9.51 min by running 10 % A through the column
until 5.5 min.
Central carbon metabolism model construction and 13C
flux analysis
The central carbon metabolism pathway model used for
13C flux analysis is shown in Fig. 1. It was constructed
based on a previous model [14], and details are shown in
Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5: Table S2, S3, S4 and S5.
The pathways included are: oxidation of methanol to
CO2 via formaldehyde and formate, conversion of
formate to methylene-H 4F using the H 4F pathway;
assimilation of methylene H 4F via the serine cycle; the
TCA cycle; the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway; gluconeo-
genesis; and anaplerotic reactions [reactions catalyzed by
pyruvate kinase, PEP carboxylase and malic enzyme]
overlapping with the serine cycle in key intermediate
metabolites nodes (such as 2-O-Phosphono-D-glyceric
acid (2PGA) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Some of
the C3 and C4 metabolites were involved in more than
one pathway in this interconnected set of cycles. For in-
stance, 1) 2PGA is the branch node for the serine cycle
and gluconeogenesis, 2) PEP and pyruvate are both in
the serine cycle and anaplerotic pathways, 3) Malate and
OAA were both in the serine cycle, TCA cycle and ana-
plerotic pathway. This complexity and redundancy offers
the cell alternatives for the connections between the
serine cycle and EMC pathway under environmental
perturbation and gene manipulation.
Methanol uptake rates and biomass yields were mea-
sured for individual conditions. Extracellular metabolite
secretion was measured using 1H NMR with a previ-
ously described protocol [26]. For in silico simulation,
Influx_s was used [27].
