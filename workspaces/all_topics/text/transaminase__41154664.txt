Abstract
Chiral amines are vital structural motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, where
enantiomeric purity governs bioactivity and environmental behavior. We identi-
fied a novel ( R)-selective amine transaminase (MwoAT) from Mycobacterium sp. via
genome mining, which exhibits activity toward the synthesis of the chiral amine
(R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine. The enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 7.0
and 40 ◦C, with high thermostability and solvent tolerance. Using an AlphaFold3-
guided semi-rational engineering strategy integrating molecular docking, alanine scan-
ning, and saturation mutagenesis, residue L175 was pinpointed as critical for substrate
binding. The resulting L175G variant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in catalytic effi-
ciency (kcat/Km) and improved thermal stability. Applied to the asymmetric synthesis of
(R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine—a precursor for the antihypertensive drug dilevalol
and potential scaffold for crop protection agents—the mutant achieved 26.4% conversion
with ≥99.9% ee. The enzyme also accepted several ketones relevant to agrochemical synthe-
sis, underscoring its versatility. This work delivers an engineered biocatalyst for sustainable
chiral amine production and demonstrates an AI-assisted protein engineering framework
applicable to both medicinal and agricultural chemistry.

1. Introduction
Chiral amines are vital building blocks in numerous pharmaceuticals and agrochemi-
cals, where stereochemical configuration critically determines their bioactivity, selectivity,
and environmental fate [ 1,2]. In pharmaceuticals, ( R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine
serves as a key intermediate for the synthesis of the antihypertensive drug dilevalol [ 3],
and in agricultural chemistry, structurally related chiral amines are incorporated into herbi-
cides, insecticides, and fungicides, where enantiomeric purity can strongly influence target
specificity, toxicity, and environmental degradability [4–6].
Conventional approaches for the synthesis of chiral amines typically rely on asymmet-
ric chemical catalysis or kinetic resolution techniques. While these methods are practically
useful, they often suffer from inherent limitations, including a low atom economy, harsh
reaction conditions, and dependence on expensive noble metal catalysts [7–9]. In contrast,
enzymatic catalysis is emerging as a green and sustainable strategy for producing opti-

cally pure amines due to its mild conditions, high stereospecificity, and environmental
compatibility [10–12].
Among various biocatalysts, transaminases have demonstrated remarkable potential
in industrial applications due to their broad substrate scope and independence from ex-
ternal cofactor regeneration [13,14]. These enzymes utilize pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)
as a coenzyme and operate via a “ping-pong” mechanism to catalyze the transfer of an
amino group from an amine donor to a ketone acceptor, thereby enabling asymmetric ami-
nation reactions [15–17]. In particular, (R)-selective amine transaminases (R-ATAs) enable
the production of enantiomerically pure chiral amines with high stereospecificity, offering
unique advantages in the synthesis of optically active pharmaceutical intermediates [18–20].
However, the number of naturally occurring R-ATAs remains limited, and most display
poor substrate adaptability, moderate thermal stability, and limited tolerance to organic
solvents, restricting their industrial scalability [21–24].
To address these limitations, recent advances in protein engineering and computational
biology have provided new strategies for R-ATA discovery and optimization. Strategies
such as rational design and directed evolution have proven effective in enhancing en-
zyme catalytic activity, broadening substrate scope, and improving stability [ 25–28]. In
particular, the integration of AI-based structure prediction tools, such as AlphaFold [29],
with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, allows the identification
of key residues for substrate binding and catalysis, providing directional guidance for
enzyme engineering [30,31]. Concurrently, bioinformatics approaches based on sequence
homology alignment and conserved domain analysis have emerged as powerful methods
for efficiently mining novel transaminases [32,33]. For example, Höhne et al. developed a
domain-focused predictive model that successfully identified R-ATA candidates from thou-
sands of protein sequences, providing an effective platform for new enzyme discovery [32].
In the present study, we identified a novel R-ATA from Mycobacterium sp., ex-
panding the limited R-ATA repertoire. Furthermore, we demonstrate the semi-
rational engineering and application of this enzyme for the asymmetric synthesis of
(R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine, a substrate with practical relevance for pharma-
ceuticals and agrochemicals. Compared with previous reports employing whole-cell
biotransformations [34], we directly utilized the purified enzyme, allowing detailed charac-
terization and optimization.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
All chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade or higher. The
MwoAT gene was codon-optimized according to the preferences of Mycobacterium and
synthetically constructed. It was subsequently subcloned into the pET-15b (+) expression
vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent
cells for protein expression. The transaminase substrate 4-phenyl-2-butanone and the amine
donor (R)-2-aminoheptane were both purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
2.2. Gene Mining and Cloning
Using the amino acid sequence of the R-ATA from Arthrobacter sp. KNK 168 [ 35]
as a template, we performed BLASTP searches against the NCBI database to identify
homologous sequences [36]. Applying an 80% sequence identity threshold yielded a clus-
ter of 97 non-redundant sequences. Multiple sequence alignment was conducted using
MUSCLE, followed by phylogenetic tree construction via the neighbor-joining method
in MEGA 12.0, to assess the evolutionary relationships between these proteins and other
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 3 of 15
type IV ATAs. Comparative alignment with the R-ATA from Arthrobacter sp. KNK 168
(PDB: 3WWH) revealed conserved amino acid motifs characteristic of the MwoAT en-
zyme. The MwoAT target gene was synthesized by General Biosystems (Chuzhou, China),
cloned into the pET-15b (+) expression vector, and transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) for
recombinant expression.
2.3. Protein Expression and Purification
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were cultured in LB medium
at 37 ◦C until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6. Protein expression was
induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG, followed by incubation at 16 ◦C for 16 h. Cells
were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM PBS, pH 7.2),
then disrupted by ultrasonication. The recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA
affinity chromatography and subsequently dialyzed against PBS buffer.
2.4. Enzyme Activity Assay and Biochemical Characterization
The standard reaction mixture (500 µL) contained 20 mM ( R)-2-aminoheptane,
20 mM 4-phenyl-2-butanone, 2 mM pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), 100 mM triethanolamine
buffer (pH 7.15), and transaminase enzyme solution at a final concentration of 10 µg/mL.
Reactions were carried out at 40 ◦C and pH 7.0 for 30 min, and then immediately quenched
by boiling at 95 ◦C in a metal bath for 10 min. After cooling, the samples were centrifuged
at 12,000× g for 5 min at 4 ◦C, and the supernatants were collected for enzymatic activ-
ity analysis. All assays were performed in triplicate, and results were reported as the
mean ± standard deviation.
One unit (U) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to
produce 1 µmol of (R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine per minute at 40 ◦C and pH 7.0
using 4-phenyl-2-butanone as the ketone acceptor.
To investigate the effect of temperature on enzyme activity, the standard reaction mix-
ture (pH 7.0) was incubated at temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 ◦C (at 5 ◦C intervals) for
30 min, followed by immediate inactivation. Residual activity was quantified using HPLC,
with the highest activity set as 100%, and the relative activities were plotted accordingly.
To assess thermostability, the enzyme was pre-incubated at 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60◦C
for 0, 10, 30, and 90 min at pH 7.0. After treatment, samples were chilled on ice for 2 min
and then subjected to the standard reaction at 40 ◦C. Residual activities were calculated
and plotted.
The effect of pH on enzyme activity was determined by replacing the buffer in the
standard assay with the following: phosphate buffer (pH 6.0, 7.0), triethanolamine buffer
(pH 7.0, 8.0), and glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 8.0, 8.5, 9.0). After standard incubation at
40 ◦C for 30 min and quenching, residual activity was measured by HPLC, normalized to
the maximum observed activity (set as 100%), and plotted.
To evaluate the effect of metal ions, 10 mM final concentrations of NaCl, KCl, MgCl2,
ZnSO4, MnCl2, CuCl2, CoCl2, NiSO4, or FeCl3 were added to the standard reaction mixture
and incubated at 40 ◦C for 30 min. The reaction without any metal ion was used as a
control (relative activity defined as 100%), and the residual activities of each treatment were
calculated and plotted.
For organic solvent tolerance assays, 10% ( v/v) of each solvent—ethyl acetate,
methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N, N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), or tetrahydrofuran (THF)—was added to the standard reaction system and incu-
bated at 40 ◦C for 30 min. The reaction without solvent served as the control (100% relative
activity), and residual activities were calculated and plotted accordingly.

2.5. Structural Modeling, Mutant Library Construction, and Functional Analysis
The 3D structure of MwoAT was predicted using AlphaFold3, validated by Rosetta,
and assessed with PROCHECK. Semi-flexible molecular docking with AutoDock Vina
(PLP as cofactor, 4-phenyl-2-butanone as substrate) identified key residues within 4 Å of
the binding pocket, which were further analyzed by alanine scanning and SAR to guide
semi-rational engineering.
Eighteen residues were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Primers were de-
signed with Geneious Prime 2024.0, and mutant plasmids were constructed via seamless
cloning (Table S2).
To investigate structural and functional effects, docking of wild-type and mutants
was performed using Discovery Studio 2019, analyzing hydrogen bonds, electrostatic
interactions, hydrophobic contacts, and unfavorable contacts. Active-site volumes and
solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated with CASTp and DoGSiteScorer. MD
simulations (30 ns) were conducted in GROMACS 2023 using AMBER99SB-ILDN and
TIP3P , with Na+/Cl− for neutralization. RMSD and RMSF analyses evaluated structural
stability and binding-pocket dynamics [37–40].
2.6. Establishment of HPLC Analytical Method
The enzymatic conversion of 4-phenyl-2-butanone to (R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine
catalyzed by MwoAT was quantitatively analyzed using high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC).
HPLC Conditions for Activity Quantification:
Mobile phase preparation: Phase A consisted of an aqueous solution of 10 mM dis-
odium hydrogen phosphate and 10 mM sodium tetraborate, adjusted to pH 6.1 with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Phase B was HPLC-grade acetonitrile.
Instrumentation parameters: A ZORBAX SB-C18 reverse-phase column(4.6 × 150 mm,
5 µm) was used with a column oven temperature of 35 ± 0.5 ◦C, flow rate of 1.0 mL/min,
and UV detection at 260 nm over 15 min.
Elution protocol: Isocratic elution with Phase A and Phase B mixed in a 60:40 ratio.
(Figures S1–S3)
Chiral HPLC Conditions for Enantiomeric Excess Determination:
Mobile phase: Phase A, n-hexane (HPLC grade); Phase B, isopropanol (HPLC grade).
Instrumentation parameters: A Chiralpak OD column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) was
used with a column temperature of 30 ± 1 ◦C, a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and UV detection
at 265 nm for 15 min.
Elution conditions: Isocratic elution with 95% Phase A and 5% Phase B.
Standard Curve Preparation:
Standard solutions were prepared by accurately weighing reference compounds on an
analytical balance and diluting to volume in volumetric flasks to obtain a concentration
series of 0 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.6 mM, and 1 mM. Each concentration was
prepared in triplicate. All samples were filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter before
injection. A standard calibration curve was generated using GraphPad Prism, plotting
compound concentration (x-axis) versus average peak area (y-axis) (Figure S4).
2.7. Enzyme Kinetics Assay
Kinetic parameters of the transaminase were determined using enzyme solutions at
a final concentration of 10 µg/mL. The reaction mixtures contained varying concentra-
tions of the ketone acceptor 4-phenyl-2-butanone (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 70, 100, 150, and
200 mM) and were incubated at 40◦C and pH 7.0 for 30 min. The reactions were terminated
by the addition of hydrochloric acid, with 0.5 µL of 4 M HCl added to every 500 µL of
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 5 of 15
reaction mixture. Subsequently, equivalent amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was
added to neutralize the solution after the reaction was quenched. The concentration of
(R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine in each sample was quantified by HPLC as described
above. Relative enzymatic activities at different substrate concentrations were calculated
and fitted using a non-linear regression model (Michaelis–Menten equation) in GraphPad
Prism 9.0 to generate the kinetic curve.
2.8. Thermal Stability Assay
The thermal stability of the transaminase was evaluated using a LightCycler® 480 II
real-time PCR system (Roche, San Francisco, CA, USA) with SYPRO Orange-based thermal
shift assay. Each reaction contained 5µg of purified enzyme, 1× SYPRO Orange fluorescent
dye, and Buffer D (20 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.5) in a total volume of 50 µL. A negative
control was prepared by replacing the enzyme solution with an equal volume of deion-
ized water (dH2O). The temperature gradient was programmed to increase linearly from
25 ◦C to 90 ◦C, and fluorescence intensity was continuously recorded. The excitation and
emission wavelengths were set to 490 nm and 605 nm, respectively.
2.9. Substrate Scope Evaluation
To investigate the catalytic potential of the mutant enzyme toward structurally diverse
carbonyl compounds and to expand its substrate spectrum, a series of prochiral ketones
were selected as alternative acceptor substrates. Each reaction mixture (500 µL) contained
20 mM (R)-2-aminoheptane, 20 mM test ketone substrate, 2 mM pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
(PLP), 100 mM triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.15), and the mutant transaminase at a final
concentration of 10 µg/mL.
The tested ketone acceptors included: (1) 4-phenyl-2-butanone; (2) 4-hydroxy-4-
phenyl-2-butanone; (3) 4-methoxy-4-phenyl-2-butanone; (4) 4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-
2-butanone; (5) 1-acetonaphthone; (6) 4-methylbenzyl acetate; (7) cyclohexanone; (8) 3-acetyl-
2-fluoropyridine.
The conversion of each substrate was analyzed using high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC). Substrate specificity was evaluated by comparing the relative conver-
sion efficiencies against the reference reaction.
3. Results
3.1. Screening and Characterization of a Novel R-Selective Amine Transaminase
Although R-selective amine transaminases (R-ATAs) exhibit excellent enantioselec-
tivity, their catalytic activity and thermal stability often fall short of the requirements for
industrial-scale applications. To develop an R-ATA with both high catalytic efficiency and
robust stability, a BLAST search (BLAST 2.16.0) was conducted in the NCBI protein database
using a previously reported R-ATA fromArthrobacter sp. KNK 168 (RCSB PDB ID: 3WWH)
as the template. This search identified a putative type IV R-ATA fromMycobacterium sp.
KWX21888.1 (Table S1), hereafter designated as MwoAT. Notably, the function of this type
IV R-ATA has not yet been reported in the literature.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1A) revealed that
MwoAT clusters within the same evolutionary clade as the known R-ATA 3WWH, indicat-
ing a high degree of sequence similarity. Further analysis of conserved motifs showed that
MwoAT harbors characteristic sequence features of R-ATAs, including the conserved motif
1: H××××YD[VT]×[STAHP] and motif 2: [FY]V[EQAWNS] [RKFGP]×[STANER] [41]
(Figure 1B), suggesting that MwoAT likely possesses R-ATA activity.

(G) Effect of organic solvents (10% v/v) on enzymatic activity at 40 ◦C and pH 7.0 for 30 min;
(H) Effect of pH on enzyme activity at 40 ◦C for 30 min.
To verify its expression and catalytic potential, the MwoAT gene was cloned into the
pET-15b expression vector containing an N-terminal 6×His tag, resulting in the construction
of the recombinant plasmid pET15b-MwoAT. The construct was confirmed by double
restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Upon expression in E. coli BL21(DE3),
a soluble protein of approximately 48 kDa—consistent with the theoretical molecular
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 7 of 15
weight—was successfully obtained (Figure 1C), laying the foundation for subsequent
functional characterization.
The enzymatic properties of MwoAT were systematically characterized. The enzyme
exhibited a temperature-dependent catalytic profile, with maximal activity observed at
50 ◦C (Figure 1D). Thermal stability assays revealed that approximately 50% of the initial
activity was retained after incubation at 50 ◦C for 90 min, whereas ~85% activity was
preserved at 40 ◦C under the same conditions (Figure 1E). Considering both optimal
catalytic activity and thermostability, 40◦C was selected as the optimal reaction temperature
for subsequent experiments. Compared with other reported R-ATAs, such as M16AT
(optimal temperature 40 ◦C) [42] and 3WWH (optimal temperature 30 ◦C) [43], MwoAT
exhibits relatively high catalytic activity at moderately elevated temperatures, underscoring
its potential for industrial applications.
MwoAT displayed optimal activity at pH 7.0, following a typical bell-shaped pH–
activity curve (Figure 1H). Enzymatic activity dropped sharply under acidic conditions
(pH ≤ 5.0), while ~65% residual activity was maintained at pH 9.0, suggesting that MwoAT
remains conformationally stable under neutral to mildly alkaline environments.
In terms of metal ion tolerance, MwoAT showed broad compatibility with most
tested metal ions, with the exception of Cu2+, which exhibited significant inhibitory effects
(Figure 1F). Moreover, the enzyme retained over 90% of its activity in the presence of 10%
(v/v) methanol, acetonitrile, DMSO, acetone, and DMF. However, its activity declined
markedly in ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran (THF), retaining only 33% and 20% of its
original activity, respectively (Figure 1G). This reduction is likely attributed to solvent-
induced disruption of the protein’s hydration shell or interference with the structural
integrity of the active site.
3.2. Catalytic Activity and Thermal Stability Enhancement via Semi-Rational Engineering
Due to the absence of an experimentally determined crystal structure for MwoAT,
AlphaFold3 was employed to generate a predictive 3D model. The highest-confidence
model was selected for subsequent analysis (Figure S5). Ramachandran plot evaluation
indicated that 95.3% of the residues were located in favored regions, and the model achieved
an Errat score of 97.015, suggesting high structural reliability suitable for structure-based
functional residue identification.
To improve the catalytic efficiency of MwoAT, a semi-rational engineering strategy
was adopted. Using AutoDock Vina, semi-flexible docking between MwoAT and the
substrate 4-phenyl-2-butanone identified 18 residues located within 4 Å of the substrate,
including H42, Y47, K118, and L175 (Figure S6). Each of these residues was subjected
to alanine scanning mutagenesis, followed by expression, purification, and enzymatic
activity evaluation. Six single-point mutants—K118A, T166A, Q171A, L175A, E201A, and
T262A—exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Among
them, the L175A variant displayed the most significant improvement (Figure 2A), suggest-
ing that the bulky leucine side chain at position 175 may hinder substrate accommodation
due to steric constraints.
Building upon these findings, NNK saturation mutagenesis libraries were constructed
for the six beneficial sites. Screening identified the L175G variant as the most active mutant,
exhibiting 166% of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type enzyme (Figure 2B). To explore
potential synergistic effects, five double mutants were constructed by combining L175G
with each of the other beneficial mutations. However, none of the double mutants surpassed
the activity of L175G alone (Figure 2C), indicating possible conformational interference or
structural incompatibility between the mutation sites.

Figure 2. Enhanced catalytic activity of MwoAT through semi-rational engineering. ( A) Relative
activities of alanine-scanning mutants; ( B) Relative activities of single-point saturation mutants;
(C) Relative activities of combinatorial double mutants.
To quantitatively evaluate the catalytic performance of MwoAT variants, the kinetic
parameters of mutants L175A and L175G toward the substrate 4-phenyl-2-butanone were
determined (Table 1). Compared to the wild-type (WT) enzyme, both mutants exhib-
ited enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), with L175A showing a 1.8-fold and L175G a
2.1-fold improvement. Specifically, the Km of L175G decreased from 68.03 ± 1.68 mM (WT)
to 42.87 ± 0.43 mM, indicating an increased substrate affinity. Concurrently, the kcat value
increased from 236.15 ± 0.21 to 319.20 ± 1.56, reflecting an elevated catalytic turnover rate.
These results demonstrate that the L175G mutation enhances both substrate binding and
catalytic efficiency.

Michaelis–Menten plots).
Enzyme k cat (min−1) K m (mM) k cat/Km (mM−1·min−1)
WT 236.15 ± 0.21 68.03 ± 1.68 3.47 ± 0.09
L175A 340.60 ± 3.25 54.25 ± 2.42 6.28 ± 0.34
L175G 319.20 ± 1.56 42.87 ± 0.43 7.44 ± 0.15
In addition, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using SYPRO Orange dye was
employed to assess the thermal stability of the mutants by determining their melting
temperatures (Tm). The WT enzyme exhibited a Tm of 53.8 ± 0.1 ◦C, whereas L175A
and L175G showed significantly elevated Tm values of 57.0 ± 0.1 ◦C and 56.0 ± 0.1 ◦C,
respectively, suggesting that both mutations confer improved thermodynamic stability to
the protein.
3.3. Substrate Scope Expansion and Asymmetric Biocatalysis
To assess the catalytic versatility of MwoAT and its mutant L175G toward struc-
turally diverse ketone substrates, a panel of representative compounds bearing distinct
functional groups and steric features was selected for activity screening. As shown in
Figure 3B, L175G exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared to the WT enzyme toward
4-phenyl-2-butanone and its structural analogs. Notably, the mutant also outperformed
WT in converting bulky substrates such as 1-acetonaphthone and 3-acetyl-2-fluoropyridine
(Figure 3C), indicating that the enlarged active-site pocket in L175G facilitates better ac-
commodation of sterically demanding substrates, thus broadening its substrate specificity.
Further time-course assays comparing WT and L175G revealed that, although the
initial reaction trajectories were similar (Figure 3D), the mutant consistently exhibited
higher catalytic efficiency. Under identical enzyme loading, the product yield of L175G
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 9 of 15
reached 12.18 ± 0.38% after 24 h, approximately double that of the WT (6.21 ± 0.03%).
Additionally, at a fixed ketone concentration of 40 mM, the effect of varying the molar ratio
of amine to ketone was investigated. The results demonstrated that a molar ratio of 6:1
(amine: ketone) yielded a maximum conversion rate of 26.4% after 20 h (Figure 3E).

strates; (D) Time-course product yield comparison between WT and L175G over 24 h; (E) Conversion
rates at varying amine-to-ketone molar ratios over different reaction times.
Chiral HPLC analysis confirmed that both WT and L175G maintained strict
R-stereoselectivity, with enantiomeric excess (ee.) values ≥99.9% (Figures S10–S13). These
results indicate a very high optical purity, demonstrating excellent stereoselectivity of the
products. The findings also show that the L175G mutation significantly improves catalytic
performance without compromising the inherent stereoselectivity, making it a promising
biocatalyst for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines.
3.4. Structural Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Reveal the Mechanism of Enhanced Catalysis
The binding pocket of an enzyme—typically a three-dimensional cavity formed on
or within the protein surface—plays a pivotal role in ligand recognition and catalysis. Its
geometric parameters (e.g., volume, depth, and aperture) and physicochemical properties
(e.g., hydrophobicity, charge distribution) collectively determine substrate specificity and
binding affinity [44].
To elucidate the molecular basis of the enhanced catalytic activity and thermostability
observed in the L175G mutant, we performed detailed structural modeling and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Binding pocket characterization using the DoGSiteScorer mod-
ule of the ProteinsPlus platform [45] revealed that the pocket volume of L175G increased to
988 Å3, compared to 917 Å3 in the wild-type enzyme. This expansion of the catalytic cavity
likely facilitates better substrate accommodation and alleviates steric hindrance.
To further probe this mechanistic hypothesis, molecular docking was conducted
using the modeled enzyme structure and the PLP–4-phenyl-2-butanone external aldimine
intermediate. The substitution of leucine with glycine at position 175 significantly reduced
local side-chain bulk, decreasing hydrophobic packing and spatial hindrance at the entrance
of the active site. Hydrogen bond analyses showed that the average distances between the
substrate and key catalytic residues Asp174 and Ser179 were shortened from 2.7 Å, 2.9 Å,
and 3.0 Å in the WT to 2.0 Å, 2.0 Å, and 1.8 Å in L175G, respectively (Figure 4A,B). This
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 10 of 15
optimized hydrogen-bonding network enhances both substrate affinity and the stabilization

(F) Radius of gyration (Rg) profiles indicating differences in global compactness; ( G) Root-Mean-
Square Fluctuation (RMSF) analysis reflecting residue-level flexibility; The L175G mutation leads to an
enlarged binding pocket, enhanced hydrogen bonding, and increased structural rigidity, contributing
to improved catalytic performance and thermostability.
Analysis of protein–substrate interactions (Figure 4C,D) revealed that the L175G
variant exhibited enhanced interactions with the aromatic ring of the substrate, thereby
improving the overall binding stability. The π–π stacking interaction between Trp157
and the substrate’s aromatic ring remained unchanged; however, the π–cation interaction
shifted from Lys118 to Arg157. In contrast, the original π–alkyl interaction contributed
by Ala137 was replaced by a π–anion interaction involving Glu201. Compared with the
π–alkyl interaction, which relies on weak van der Waals forces, the π–anion interaction
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 11 of 15
involves a stronger electrostatic attraction [47,48]. This alteration in the interaction pattern
helps stabilize the substrate conformation within the active site, thereby enabling the
L175G variant to exhibit higher catalytic activity toward 4-phenyl-2-butanone and its
structural analogues.
To elucidate the structural basis for the enhanced thermal stability of the L175G variant,
MD simulations were performed on both WT and mutant enzymes. As shown in Figure 4G,
the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profile of L175G is uniformly lower than that of
WT, particularly in the 50–100 and 250–300 residue regions, indicating reduced backbone
flexibility and improved structural rigidity. Similarly, the radius of gyration (Rg) of L175G
remains consistently smaller throughout the simulation (Figure 4F), suggesting a more
compact global conformation, likely due to enhanced hydrophobic packing and a reinforced
hydrogen-bond network.
Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) analysis (Figure 4E) revealed that the L175G
mutant reached equilibrium after approximately 10 ns, maintaining lower RMSD values
than the wild-type enzyme, thereby corroborating its enhanced structural stability. From
a structural perspective, the L175G substitution alleviates steric hindrance imposed by
the bulkier leucine side chain, thereby increasing overall rigidity and suppressing confor-
mational unfolding at elevated temperatures [49,50]. These synergistic effects collectively
underpin the observed improvement in thermodynamic stability.
4. Discussion
In this study, we successfully identified and comprehensively characterized a novel
(R)-selective amine transaminase (MwoAT) fromMycobacterium sp. through genome mining
and bioinformatic screening. The enzyme exhibited an optimal pH of 7.0 and a temperature
optimum of 40 ◦C, along with remarkable thermostability and broad tolerance to multiple
organic solvents, thereby highlighting its potential for industrial biocatalytic applications.
To overcome the enzyme’s inherent catalytic limitations, we employed an AlphaFold3-
guided semi-rational engineering strategy integrating structural modeling, molecular dock-
ing, alanine scanning, and saturation mutagenesis, which successfully yielded the L175G
variant. This mutant achieved a 2.1-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) over
the wild-type enzyme. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations revealed
that the L175G substitution relieved steric hindrance, expanded the substrate-binding
pocket, and reinforced hydrogen-bond networks involving key catalytic residues (Asp174,
Ser179), thus enhancing substrate affinity, turnover rate, and thermal stability.
When benchmarked against prior R-ATA engineering efforts, the 2.1-fold improve-
ment achieved here is moderate but meaningful. For instance, Xie et al. reported a 2.8-fold
enhancement in AtTA catalytic efficiency through H210N and I77L substitutions combined
with disulfide bond formation (M150C and M280C), which also markedly improved ther-
mostability [51]. Similarly, a single-point mutation F113T in an ω-transaminase variant led
to a 1.3–1.7-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward pyruvate and MBA sub-
strates, highlighting that even subtle active-site modifications can significantly modulate
enzyme kinetics [52]. Compared with these studies, the L175G variant of MwoAT exhibits
a performance level at the mid-to-upper range, with the added benefit of enhanced thermal
stability over its wild-type counterpart.
When applied to the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine—a
pharmaceutically and agrochemically important chiral amine intermediate serving as a
key precursor to the antihypertensive drug dilevalol and a scaffold for crop-protection
agents—the L175G variant achieved a preparative-scale conversion of 26.4% while
maintaining ≥ 99.9% enantiomeric excess and strict R-stereoselectivity (Scheme 1). More-
over, the substrate scope expansion to aromatic and heteroaryl ketones further underscores
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 1435 12 of 15
the synthetic utility of MwoAT. Importantly, the amine product from substrate 2 serves
as an intermediate for Ractopamine synthesis, while the product from substrate 5 is a key
precursor for Cinacalcet, demonstrating the pharmaceutical relevance of this biocatalyst.
Scheme 1. Transamination catalyzed by MwoAT to synthesize (R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine,
with yields and enantiomeric excess (ee) of representative reactions indicated.
Although the 4-phenyl-2-butanone is not a natural substrate, MwoAT’s performance
demonstrates the feasibility of designing and optimizingR-ATAs for non-natural substrates,
providing a valuable strategy for expanding the application of these enzymes in industrial
biocatalysis. Taken together, these results suggest that MwoAT is not only operationally
robust but also an effective biocatalyst for industrially relevant chiral amine synthesis,
emphasizing both its novelty and functional advantages.
Despite these promising outcomes, several limitations remain. The relatively low
conversion yield (26.4%) may limit immediate industrial applicability. Moreover, the
moderate fold-improvement and lack of additive effects in combinatorial mutants suggest
mechanistic constraints. We speculate that the wild-type enzyme may already be near its
thermodynamic optimum, or that rate-limiting steps involve cofactor binding or product
release rather than the targeted residues. The failure of combinatorial mutants likely
results from negative epistasis, where beneficial mutations interact unfavorably, creating
steric or conformational conflicts that diminish catalytic efficiency. Future efforts could
focus on distal allosteric sites or employ mutagenesis strategies designed to minimize
such interactions.
To address these challenges, multiple strategies could be explored: (i) use of isopropy-
lamine as an amine donor, enabling continuous acetone removal to shift the reaction equilib-
rium toward product formation [53]; (ii) implementation of coupled enzymatic systems for
in situ by-product removal or cofactor regeneration to improve conversion efficiency [54];
(iii) process intensification via substrate feeding optimization, enzyme immobilization, or
reaction medium engineering to enhance yield and operational robustness. Furthermore,
the current structural insights rely on AlphaFold3-predicted models rather than experi-
mentally resolved structures, which may limit the precision of active-site geometry and
substrate-binding analyses. Future studies incorporating X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM,
and iterative combinatorial mutagenesis could further improve enzyme performance while
validating the mechanistic basis underlying the observed enhancements.
5. Conclusions
Overall, this work delivers an engineered and adaptable biocatalyst for the sustain-
able production of bioactive chiral amines with applications spanning pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals, and agricultural biotechnology. It also establishes a generalizable “AI-based
structure prediction–semi-rational engineering–functional validation–mechanistic interpre-
tation” workflow for enzyme design. This integrated approach provides both theoretical
insights and practical tools for developing next-generation biocatalysts that meet the effi-
ciency, selectivity, and environmental sustainability requirements of modern medicinal and
agricultural chemistry.
