Structure-guided semi-rational design of an imine reductase 
for enantio-complementary synthesis of pyrrolidinamine 
We aimed to obtain engineered imine reductases (IREDs) of 
IRED M5 through structure-guided semi-rational design. The 
results showed that two residues, W234 and F260, played 
crucial roles in enhancing and reversing stereoselectivity, 
respectively. Additionally, the study produced two enantio-
complementary variants: S241L/F260N (with R-selectivity 
up to 99%) and I149D/W234I (with S-selectivity up to 99%). 
Furthermore, the study demonstrated the application of 
these biocatalysts in a short synthesis of key intermediates 
for potential drug molecules, using a cost-eff ective and 
readily available pro-chiral N-Boc-piperidone.

In this study, engineered imine reductases (IREDs) of IRED M5, originally from Actinoalloteichus
hymeniacidonis, were obtained through structure-guided semi-rational design. By focusing on
mutagenesis of the residues that directly interact with the ketone donor moiety, we identiﬁed two
residues W234 and F260, playing essential roles in enhancing and reversing the stereoselectivity,
respectively. Moreover, two completely enantio-complementary variants S241L/F260N (R-selectivity up
to 99%) and I149D/W234I (S-selectivity up to 99%) were achieved. Both variants showed excellent
stereoselectivity toward the tested substrates, o ﬀering valuable biocatalysts for synthesizing
pyrrolidinamines. Its application was demonstrated in a short synthesis of the key intermediates of
potential drug molecules leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor 4, from cheap and commercially available
pro-chiral N-Boc-piperidone 1 (2 and 3 steps, respectively).
Introduction
Chiral amines are used as privileged structural motifs in the
pharmaceutical industry. 1 Classical chemical processes
typically rely on resolution of racemic amines or nucleophilic
displacement of activated chiral alcohols.
2 Catalytic processes
of asymmetric reductive amination are also available. However,
they su ﬀer from side reactions or the use of expensive
transition-metal complexes with chiral ligands that can be
diﬃcult to obtain and remove.
3,4 A biocatalyst provides a new
choice for green and eﬃcient synthesis of chiral amines.5,6
NADPH dependent imine reductases (IREDs) are one of the
most attractive biocatalysts for the synthesis of chiral
amines.
7–10 Since IREDs were identi ed by Nagasawa and
co-workers in 2010, they have been reported to reduce
structurally di ﬀerent imines and synthesize diverse chiral
amines.11 A subfamily of IREDs is fascinating for creating
secondary or tertiary amines by reductive amination of
pro-chiral ketones or aldehydes and amines in equal
stoichiometric amounts, which is the most straightforward
strategy for the generation of alkylamines.12 Notably, IREDs
have been reported to accept a wide range of ketones and
amines
12–27 and successfully applied to the commercial
manufacture of LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552 and JAK1 inhibitor
abrocitinib.
28,29
Enantiomers frequently behave very diﬀerently in biological
systems due to their diﬀerent shapes in 3-dimensional space in
drug molecules; thus producing both enantiomers is an
important task in the pharmaceutical industry.30,31 Since the
discovery of these R- and S-selective IREDs, they have been
capable of the asymmetric reduction of various prochiral imine
substrates with a high degree of stereoselectivity.
11,32,33
According to a large number of reported substrate screenings,
IREDs are also selectively preferred in IRED catalytic reductive
amination reactions.
12,18,25 Therefore, to access both the
optically pure enantiomers, it is o en necessary to screen
an extensive enzyme library to obtain complementary
stereoselective IREDs. 13,16,24–27 However, the target natural
enzymes are o en not suitable for industrial application
because of their low catalytic eﬃciency or thermostability. In
this case, large mutagenesis e ﬀorts for complementary
stereoselective enzymes are needed to meet the requirements of
industrial processes.
26,28,29 Alternatively, rationally engineering
an enzyme, which shows high catalytic eﬃciency for target
substrates, to obtain enantio-preference enzymes is a highly
eﬃcient method. 34–38 Rational design usually focuses on
a minority of potential amino acids, which can signicantly
reduce the number of mutants to be investigated.37,38 Although

several advances focusing on tuning enzymatic catalytic
eﬃciency have been reported,26,28,29 rational design of IREDs for
stereo-divergent reductive amination to synthesize both
stereoisomers is relatively undeveloped.
Pyrrolidinamines are important functional groups in many
pharmaceuticals, including ce obiprole,
30 tomopenem
(CS-023),31,39 leniolisib,40 clinaoxacin41 and tosu oxacin42
(Fig. 1A). Recently, asymmetric imine reduction of
pyrrolidinamine building blocks of pharmaceuticals using
IRED has been well studied.43–45 We also reported a wild type
IRED IR-G36 fromA. hymeniacidonis, which was engineered to
obtain a mutant M5 producing a diverse spectrum of piperidine
and azepane alkylamines through reductive amination, with
excellent catalytic eﬃciency, R-selectivity, and thermostability.
26
However, when usingN-Boc-3-pyrrolidone 1 as a ketone donor,
M5 displayed poor stereoselectivity with an ee value of 44% (R),
despite high catalytic eﬃciency with substrate loading up to 19
gL −1. Thus, M5 has emerged as an attractive starting point for
exploring the preparation of bothR- and S-pyrrolidinamines.
Given the importance of pyrrolidinamines, we performed the
mechanism- and structure-guided semi-rational design
of IRED-M5 to acquire variants with a high degree of enantio-
complementary stereoselectivities for e ﬃcient synthesis of
a series of pyrrolidinamines. Based on the eﬃcient platform,
chemoenzymatic synthesis of key intermediates of JAK1
inhibitor 4 (ref. 46) and leniolisib was performed with fewer
steps compared to previous chemical methods using pro-chiral
starting material1 (Fig. 1B).
Herein, we report an IRED-catalyzed stereo-divergent reductive
amination strategy for synthesizing key intermediates,
pyrrolidiamines, enabled by the directed evolution of IREDs. This
enzymatic reaction was key to delivering a new process starting
from a pro-chiral compound with reduced cost and fewer steps
for the synthesis of enantio-complementary pyrrolidiamines, key
intermediates for both leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor 4,
respectively.
Semi-rational design
According to the catalytic mechanism of IRED, the carbonyl
substrate couples to the amine substrate to form the imine
intermediate aer deprotonation and elimination of a water
molecule. Then, the imine is reduced by the cofactor NADPH to
give the nal chiral amine product. As such, the imine

intermediate may bind in two distinct orientations relative to
Pro-(S) or Pro-(R), diﬀering by a rotation of∼180 deg around the
axis along the C]N bond. Thus, the amino acids that interact
directly with the ketone moiety are the most inuential ones for
controlling stereoselectivity, which is supported by previous
studies showing that diﬀerent amine donors have less eﬀect on
the stereoselectivity of IRED catalyzed reactions in their
substrate scope studies.
12,18,25,26
In this study,N-Boc-pyrrolidone 1 and benzylamine a were
initially chosen as the model substrates for M5-catalyzed
reductive amination. In order tond the potential mutation
sites, the imine intermediate was docked into the crystal
structure of M5 using the Discovery Studio. The docking result
indicated that the N-Boc-piperidine moiety faces the side
opening of the tunnel (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the
relative position of ketone in the reported quaternary complex
of AtRedAm.
46 Thus, we assumed that the residues controlling
stereoselectivity were located near the side opening of the active
pocket.
Analysis of the docking result indicated thatve amino acid
residues I149, M203, W234, S241, and F260, were identied to
interact directly with the N-Boc-piperidine moiety (Fig. 2A).
Noteworthily, two residues W234 and F260 are located on either
side of theN-Boc-piperidine moiety respectively, and their large
side chains generate steric hindrance to the bulkyN-Boc group,
which restrains the imine intermediate to rotate freely along the
axis (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they are important in providing
a steric constraint for controlling the face for hydride delivery.
Thus, a larger cavity at the tryptophan 234 or phenylalanine 260
positions could better facilitate access to the bulkyN-Boc group.
In other words, mutating W234 to a smaller amino acid might
create more space for the predominant Pro-(S) conformer of the
imine intermediate in the active site. Otherwise, exchanging
F260 with a smaller amino acid might cause the predominant
Pro-(R) conformer (Fig. 2B).
Subsequently, site-saturation mutagenesis was performed at
positions 234 and 260, respectively, to investigate the
stereoselectivities corresponding with the volume of the
residue, and the result is shown in Fig. 2C and D. As expected,
most of the mutants at position 260 enhanced R-selectivity
except F260W, implying that exchanging large F260 with a
smaller residue oﬀers a large enough pocket for the bulkyN-Boc
group to improve the binding ability of the Pro-(R) conformer of
the imine intermediate. Three mutations led to >85%
R-selectivity, and the highestR-selective mutants were F260D
(93% ee), F260E (92% ee), and F260N (88% ee). However,
when F260 was replaced by two positively charged amino
acids with long chains, the mutants F260K and F260R
almost lost their catalytic activity (Fig. 2C). Mutations at
position 234 are also in line with our expectations. Most
of the mutants showed reversed stereoselectivity, and
two mutants W234I and W234L showed the bestS-selectivity
with ee values of 82% and 81%, respectively. These results
indicated that the residue at position 234 was crucial for the
enantioselectivity via tuning the size of the stereospecicity
pocket and acting as a switch for complementary
stereoselectivities.
To further improveR- andS-stereoselectivity, the other three
residues I149, M203, and S241 were investigated. Three amino
acids of di ﬀerent sizes alanine (A), leucine (L), and
phenylalanine (F) were chosen for site-specic mutagenesis
over M5. As shown in Fig. 3, I149F, I149L, and S241L showed
enhanced R-selectivity with ee values of 84%, 79%, and 85%,
respectively. In contrast, the mutant I149A showed a reversed

stereoselectivity with an ee value of 45% (S). However, the
mutations of M203A, M203F, and M203L showed no
S-stereoselectivity. All results indicate that residues that interact
directly with the N-Boc-piperidine moiety have signi cant
eﬀects on stereoselectivity.
Both enantioselective variants were optimized utilizing
combinational mutagenesis. First, we combined the
R-stereoselective mutant s F260D, F260E, and F260N with
S241F and I149L, respectively. As a result, the combinatorial
variants S241L/F260D, S241L/F260E and S241L/F260N
showed excellent R-selectivity with an ee value of 99%,
while the combinational variants of I149F and site F260
displayed dramatically decreased catalytic activity. Aerward,
we investigated the combination of I149A and W234I to
synthesize (S)-1a. Although the combinatorial variant I149A/
W234I showed improved S-selectivity with an ee value of
97%, it did not meet the biocatalyst criteria for industrial
application. To gain deeper insight into the contribution of
site I149 on S-selectivity, we carried out saturation mutation
on this hot position over W234I. To our delight, two variants
I149D/W234I and I149H/W234I showed the bestS-selectivity
with ee values of 99% (Table 1). While all the double mutants
showed comparable high enantioselectivities, their catalytic
activities may vary widely. Thus, 5 mL-scale biotransformation
started with N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone 1 and benzylamine
hydrochloride a (1.1 eq.) using puried enzymes (5 mg mL
−1),
and the results are assessed in Table 1. It was found that the
catalytic activity of S241L/F260N was higher than that of
S241L/F260D and S241L/F260E among theR-selective variants,
with a conversion of 99%. The best S-selective variant was
I149D/W234I with a conversion of 99%, which was about 50%
higher than that of I149H/W234I.

Shedding light on the mechanism of enantio-controlling
To gain molecular insights into the stereo-divergent behavior,
the imine intermediate was docked into the active sites
of S241L/F260N and I149D/W234I, respectively (Fig. 4).
Obviously, the smaller sidechain of asparagine at site-260 gives
more space for the bulkyN-Boc group and makes the imine
intermediate more likely to stay with Pro-(R) conformations in
the active site of mutant S241L/F260N to produce (R)-1a (83%
yield, 99% ee). On the opposite side, when W234 is replaced
with smaller isoleucine, it loses the steric restraints for the

amine donors with types and volumes using the two best enantio-
complementary variants S241L/F260D and I149D/W234I (Fig. 5).
Reductive aminations ofN-Boc-piperidone1 (100 mM or 110 mM)
and 12 aminesb–m (1.1 eq.) with various volumes were tested
under the optimized conditions using cell-free extract (10 g L
−1
wet cell weight). GDH was used for the NADPH recycling system
and DMSO (20% v/v) was added as a co-solvent supporting the
solubility of ketone1 in the phosphate buﬀer (PBS) at pH 7.0.
Although amine donors of diﬀerent types and volumes were
utilized, most reactions catalyzed by S241L/F260N and I149D/
W234I showed excellent enantioselectivity with ee values (>99%,
R)a n d( > 9 9 % ,S), respectively, which again indicated that amine
donors had relatively less inuence on the stereoselectivity of
IRED-catalyzed reductive aminations. In terms of conversion,ve
chain amines ( a–e)a r ee ﬃciently processed to create the
corresponding amine products 1a–1d in good to excellent
conversions (76 –99%). An obvious preference for
cyclopropanaminef among the four cyclic aminesf–i was found
in the reactions, and the conversions were up to 90% and 99%,
respectively. Sterically hindered aminesg–i, which were poor
amine donors for our previous report,
26 showed low to moderate
conversions (11–63%) in this study, and even a trace amount of1i
could be detected in the reactions. Additionally, the
reactions between1 and the aminesj and k gave moderate to high
conversions (29–95%), highlighting that the binding pockets of
both variants are large enough for the bulky substrates.
Synthetic application in the synthesis of leniolisib and JAK1
inhibitor intermediates
We then began to apply the IRED mutant to prepare
pyrrolidinamine intermediates 2 and 3 of the potential drug
molecules leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor4. Leniolisib is an orally
active, potent PI3Kd selective inhibitor with suitable properties
and eﬃcacy for clinical development as an anti-inammatory
and anti-neoplastic therapeutic. 40,44,45 In 2018, Kim and
co-workers reported4 as a potential rheumatoid arthritis drug
candidate. Its inhibitory activity and selectivity for JAK1 over
other JAKs were based on replacing the piperidine moiety of
tofacitinib with a pyrrolidine moiety.
47
The newly developed IRED catalyzed reductive amination
enabled us to complete the synthesis of core skeleton3 in two
steps and2 in three steps from pro-chiral compound1, which
are more e ﬃcient than the reported ones from pro-chiral
compounds. Our synthesis started with cheaper and
commercially available N-Boc-piperidone 1, which underwent
asymmetric reductive amination catalyzed by the I149D/W234I
mutant to give (S)-3-pyrrolidinamine 1a in 84% (99% ee) yield
(Scheme 1). The benzyl protecting group was removed under the
conditions of Pd/C with H
2 in MeOH to obtain free amine in
72% yield. The SNAr reaction with pyrimidine5 was performed
to produce the core skeleton 2 of leniolisib in 90% yield.
Alternatively, treatment of N-Boc-piperidone 1 with mutant
S241L/F260N successfully synthesized pyrrolidinamine 1b in
81% yield with R-conguration in 99% ee. The reaction with
6-chloro-7-deazapurine 6 under the conditions of K2CO3 in H2O
reux for 24 h gave the key intermediate3 in 52% yield. Notably,
in the SNAr reaction step, the Boc protecting group was also
removed under basic conditions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we constructed a biocatalytic platform for the
enantio-complementary synthesis of pyrrolidinamines via
engineered IRED-catalyzed reductive amination. Based on
mechanism- and structure-guided semi-rational design, we
demonstrate that amino acids interacting directly with the ketone
moiety are hot spots for stereoselective modication. Two key sites
234 and 260 were recognized as the crucial“switches” which
control the imine intermediate with Pro-(S)o rP r o - (R)c o n f o r m e r s
in the active site. Screening of <80 mutants resulted in two
combinatorial variants S241L/F260N and I149D/W234I with
Scheme 1 Stereo-divergent strategy for the synthesis of key intermediates2 and 3 of leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor4.

demonstrated by a 2 or 3-step synthesis of key intermediates of
leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor4, respectively. We expect this new
methodology to have broad application for the stereoselective
