Abstract 
This study aimed to characterize the effects of different dietary forms of supplemental manganese ( Mn) on hepatic lipid deposition, gene 
expression, and enzyme activity in liver fat metabolism in 42-d-old broiler chickens. In total 420 one-day-old Arbor Acres (AA) broilers (roost-
er:hen =  1:1) were assigned randomly based on body weight and sex to 1 of 6 treatments (10 replicate cages per treatment and 7 broilers per 
replicate cage) in a completely randomized design using a 2 (sex)  ×  3 (diet) f actorial arrangement. The 3 diets were basal control diets without 
Mn supplementation and basal diets supplemented with either Mn sulfate or Mn proteinate. No sex  ×  diet interactions were observed in any 
of the measured indexes; thus, the effect of diet alone was presented in this study. Dietary Mn supplementation increased Mn content in the 
plasma and liver, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activity, and ATGL mRNA and its protein expression in the liver by 5.3% to 24.0% (P < 0.05), 
but reduced plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels, liver TG content, fatty acid synthase (FAS ) 
and malic enzyme (ME) activities, mRNA expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), FAS, stearoyl-coA desaturase 
(SCD), and ME, as well as the protein expression of SREBP1 and SCD in the liver by 5.5% to 22.8% (P <  0.05). No dif ferences were observed 
between the 2 Mn sources in all of the determined parameters. Therefore, it was concluded that dietary Mn supplementation, regardless of Mn 
source, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation in broilers by inhibiting SREBP1 and SCD expression, FAS and ME activities, and enhancing ATGL 
expression and activity.
Lay Summary 
Dietary manganese supplementation regulates lipid deposition in broiler chickens, with the liver being a significant site of lipid metabolism. This 
study investigated the effects of different dietary forms of supplemental manganese on hepatic lipid deposition, gene expression, and enzyme 
activity in the liver fat metabolism of broiler chickens. The results showed that dietary manganese supplementation decreased the hepatic 
lipid accumulation of broilers by inhibiting the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and stearoyl-coA desaturase 
(SCD), as well as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and malic enzyme (ME) activities, and enhancing the expression and activity of adipose triglyceride 
lipase (ATGL). This reduction in excessive fat production will help improve poultry health and mitigate losses in the poultry industry.

Introduction
In poultry, plasma lipids are primarily triglycerides ( TGs), 
which are synthesized in liver cells and stored in fat cells 
(Wang et al., 2017; Nematbakhsh et al., 2021). Similar to 
humans, chickens primarily synthesize fatty acids in the liver 
(Lin et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2022). Understanding the intrin-
sic transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mech -
anisms of fatty acid synthesis is important for the prevention 
of fatty liver in poultry.
Manganese (Mn) is an indispensable micromineral for 
poultry because it affects protein, fat, and carbohydrate 
metabolism (Li and Yang, 2018 ). The lipophilic factor Mn

plays a key role in fat metabolism in poultry. Dietary Mn 
supplementation significantly reduced fat deposition (Lv et 
al., 2022). Numerous studies have demonstrated that adding 
110 mg Mn/kg to diets in broilers could decrease abdominal 
fat accumulation ( Lu et al., 2006 , 2007). Reportedly, tran-
scriptional factors, such as sterol-regulatory element-binding 
protein 1 (SREBP 1), regulate liver fat metabolism (Wang et 
al., 2009). SREBP1 is a critical putative transcriptional factor 
that initiates the initial lipid synthesis pathway. Meanwhile, it 
has been shown that modulation of adipocyte differentiation 
by SREBP1 is mediated through its effect on the expression 
or functionality of specific target genes in lipid metabolism 
(Wang et al., 2017 ; Wang, 2019). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC), fatty acid synthase ( FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desatu-
rase (SCD) are crucial enzymes related to lipid metabolism 
(Liu et al., 2018 ). SREBP1 regulates TG production and the 
expression of FAS, SCD, ACC, and other enzymes (Liu et al., 
2010; Garcia Caraballo et al., 2017 ). Lu et al. (2017) found 
that Mn reduced chicken liver cell injury and regulated the 
expression of fat metabolism-related enzymes such as FAS 
and malic enzyme ( ME) at the transcriptional level. In our 
previous experiment, the addition of dietary Mn decreased 
the abdominal lipid accumulation of broilers by downregulat-
ing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated recep-
tor γ (PPARγ) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) 
and enhancing triglyceride lipase ( ATGL) expression and 
activity in the abdominal fat of broilers. Furthermore, Mn 
proteinate with moderate chelation strength (Mn-Prot M, Q
f 
value =  51.8),  but not Mn sulfate, effectively decreased the 
FAS activity compared with the Mn-unsupplemented con -
trol, although no difference was observed between Mn-Prot 
M and Mn sulfate ( Cui et al., 2023). However, whether 
dietary Mn supplementation affects the liver fat accumula-
tion of broilers and the possible mechanisms involved remain 
unclear. These studies suggest that Mn supplementation mod-
ulate fat metabolism by probably affecting SREBP1 expres-
sion and then regulating the transcription or translation of fat 
metabolism-related genes, including FAS, ACC, and SCD, in 
broilers. Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary Mn supple-
mentation would decrease liver fat deposition by modulating 
fat metabolism-related enzyme activities and gene expression 
in the liver of broilers and that Mn-Prot M would be superior 
to Mn sulfate. Additionally, roosters and hens may respond 
differently to the modulating effects of dietary Mn addition.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary added 
Mn source (Mn sulfate or Mn-Prot M) on plasma TG, total 
cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C
), high-  
density cholesterol ( HDL-C) levels, liver fat accumulation, 
and fat metabolism-related enzyme (e.g., ATGL, ACC, and 
FAS) activities, as well as the mRNA and protein expressions 
of fat metabolism-related genes (e.g., SREBP1, ACC, FAS, and 
ATGL) in the liver of roosters or hens to confirm previously 
stated scientific hypotheses.
Materials and Methods
Animal ethics
Animals were used and cared for according to the Commit -
tee on Animal Use of the Ministry of Agriculture of China 
(Beijing, China) guidelines. The Animal Ethics Committee of 
Yangzhou University approved this study (approval number: 
SYXK (Su) 2021-0027).
Experimental design and treatments
Six treatments in total were included in a completely random-
ized design with a 2 (sex) ×  3 (diet) factorial arrangement.  The 
2 sexes were rooster and hen, and the 3 diets were used: basal 
control diets without Mn supplementation (control, 17.52 mg 
Mn/kg for days 1 to 21 and 15.62  mg Mn/kg for days 22 
to 42 based on analysis, respectively) and basal diets supple -
mented with Mn (110  mg/kg for days 1 to 21 and 80  mg/
kg for days 22 to 42) in the form of either feed grade Mn 
sulfate (MnSO
4.H2O, 32.19% Mn by analysis) or feed grade 
Mn-Prot M (15.85% Mn and Qf = 51.8 by analysis). The lev-
els of dietary Mn added were based on the Mn requirements 
(total dietary Mn levels of approximately 130 mg/kg [1 to 21 
d] and 100 mg/kg [22 to 42 d]) of broilers as estimated in our 
previous studies (Li et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2016). The 2 Mn 
sources and dietary supplemental Mn levels were previously 
reported by Cui et al. (2023).
Animals and diets
Based on the experimental design and treatments described 
above, 420 one-day-old Arbor Acres (AA) broilers (roost-
er:hen =  1:1) were randomly divided into 1 of 6 treatments 
based on body weight and sex, with 10 replicate cages of 7 
broilers per cage for each treatment. Birds were fed the 3 diets 
for 42 d. The corn–soybean meal basal diets were formulated 
to meet or exceed the requirements of broilers for all other 
nutrients except for Mn, as recommended by the NRC (1994) 
and the Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of 
China (2004). Table 1 lists the composition of the basal diets. 
Table 2 lists the analyzed Mn contents in the diets. Feeding 
management, body weight weighing, recording of feed con -
sumption and dead birds, composition of the basal diets, for-
mulation and mixing of all treatment diets, and analyzed Mn 
contents in all treatment diets throughout the experimental 
period were the same as in the study by Cui et al. (2023).
Samples collections and preparations
Samples of diets, tap water, Mn sulfate, and Mn-Prot M were 
collected and analyzed as described by Cui et al. (2023). At 42 
d of age, 3 broilers were randomly selected from each repli-
cate cage based on the cage’s average body weight and fasted 
overnight without water restriction. Then, 5 mL of blood was 
collected into an anticoagulation tube (Anticoagulant: eth -
ylene diamine tetraacetic acid) from the wing vein of each 
bird and centrifuged to harvest the plasma. After bleeding, 
the birds were slaughtered by the cervical dislocation. The 
liver was removed via dissection, and 1.5  g of the liver tip 
was taken into a 2-mL centrifuge tube, frozen in −196 °C 
liquid nitrogen, and then transferred to a −80 °C refrigerator 
for gene expression assays. The remaining liver sample was 
stored at −20 °C for enzyme activity and TG measurements. 
All samples of the 3 birds in each replicate cage were mixed in 
equal proportions to form a single sample before the assays.
Determinations of Mn and lipid contents in plasma 
and liver
Manganese contents in the plasma and liver were measured 
as described by Cui et al. (2023). Plasma levels of TG, TC, 
HDL-C, and LDL-C were measured using a fully automated 
biochemical analyzer (7180, Hitachi, Japan). Liver TG con -
tent was determined using a commercial kit (A110-1-1, Nan-
jing Jiancheng, China). The steps were as follows: the 50  mg

of the liver was homogenized using a homogenizer (N9548, 
HODER, Beijing, China). The mixture was centrifuged at 
2,500 × g
 for 10 min at 4 °C,  and the supernatant was care -
fully extracted. Then, 2.5 µL of the supernatant was added to 
250 µL of the working solution and incubated at 37 °C for 
10 min.  After incubation, the absorbance value was measured 
at 500 nm.  These assays were performed using a microplate 
reader (SPARK 30086376, Tecan Austria GmbH, Grodig, 
Austria).
Enzyme activity assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) commercial 
kits were used to determine the activities of FAS (catalog 
number: FC-9788), ACC (catalog number: FC-4780), ME 
(catalog number: FC-6637), and ATGL (catalog number: 
FC-6594) in the liver, following the manufacturer’s instruc -
tions (Beijing Fangcheng Biotechnology Ltd, Beijing, China). 
Briefly, 50 mg of the liver sample was homogenized using a 
homogenizer (N9548, HODER), and the mixture was then 
centrifuged at 2,000 × g
 for 20 min at 4 °C.  The supernatants 
were transferred to special 96-well plates coated with specific 
antibodies, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min,  washed with wash-
ing solutions, and incubated with enzyme labeling reagents at 
37 °C for another 30 min.  Specific dyes were then added, and 
incubated at 37 °C for 15 min for color development,  and the 
absorbance values were measured at 450  nm using a micro -
plate reader (SPARK 30086376, Tecan Austria GmbH) to 
calculate the activities of the above-mentioned enzymes. The 
protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic 
acid (BCA) protein assay kit (catalog number: 23225, Ther -
moFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the liver using TRIzol reagent 
(Vazyme Biotechnology, Nanjing, China). cDNA was pre -
pared for real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 
using a commercially available kit (Vazyme Biotechnology). 
AceQ SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme Biotechnology) was 
used for the RT-qPCR procedure. Real-time PCR was con -
ducted under amplification conditions, and the primers were 
synthesized by Beijing Tsingke Biotech. The resulting data 
were normalized using the 2
−ΔΔCt method to calculate the rela-
tive mRNA expression. The geometric mean of 2 internal ref-
erence genes, namely β-actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was employed for normalization. 
Table 3 presents the primer sequences of the relevant genes.
Total protein extraction and western blotting
The liver samples were homogenized using radioimmu-
noprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) 
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a homogenizer (N9548, 
HODER). Lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 
4 min at 4 °C.  The liquid above the sediment was collected, 
and protein concentrations were determined. The liver lysates 
with a protein content of 40 μg were separated using either 8% 
or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropho-
resis (SDS-PAGE). Protein expression levels of the target genes 
in the liver were analyzed via Western blotting. Anti-SREBP1 
(16643-1-AP14088-1-AP, dilution 1:1,000), anti-ATGL 
(55190-1-AP, dilution 1:1,000), and anti-SCD (23393-1-AP, 
dilution 1: 1,000) were purchased from Proteintech Group, 
Inc. (Chicago, IL, USA). The anti-β -actin (HX1829, dilution 
1:5000) antibody was purchased from Huaxingbio (Beijing, 
China). As for secondary antibodies, anti-mouse (HX2032, 
dilution 1:5000) or goat anti-rabbit (HX2031, dilution 
1:5,000) antibodies were purchased from Huaxingbio. Protein 
bands were observed using a chemiluminescent image scanner 
(Tanon Technology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China).
Statistical analyses
All data were subjected to 2-way ANOVA using the GLM 
program of SAS 9.4 (SAS, Institute, 2013), with the model

including sex, diet, and their interactions. Different treatments 
were distinguished using the LSD method. Before analysis, the 
percentage of bird mortality data was transformed into arc -
sine values. Each replicate cage was treated as an experimen-
tal unit. P
 <  0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Growth performance and mortality
The average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed-to-gain 
ratio, and mortality of broilers were not affected by diet and 
sex ×  diet interaction.  These results have been reported previ-
ously (Cui et al., 2023).
Manganese contents in the plasma and liver
As shown in Table 4, both sex and diet affected Mn contents 
in the plasma and liver of broilers on day 42 ( P < 0.0001), 
except for the sex  ×  diet interaction.  In comparison with the 
control, Mn addition increased the Mn contents in the plasma 
and liver by 17.5% and 18.1% ( P
 < 0.0001), respectively, 
and no differences were observed between the 2 Mn sources. 
Compared with hens, roosters had increased Mn contents in 
the plasma and liver of 14.1% and 5.65% (P
 < 0.04), respec-
tively.
Plasma lipid indices
Diet affected plasma TC, TG, and LDL contents of broilers at 
42 d of age (P
 <  0.02),  whereas sex affected plasma TC, TG, 
LDL, and HDL contents (P  < 0.04) (Table 5). However, diet 
had no effect on plasma HDL content, and sex ×  diet interac-
tion had no effect on all of the above parameters. Compared 
with the control, Mn supplementation decreased plasma LDL, 
TC, and TG levels by 11.7%, 5.5%, and 11.3%, respectively 
(
P < 0.02),  and no differences were observed between the 2 
Mn sources. Compared with roosters, the hens had decreased 
plasma TC, LDL, and HDL levels of 5.7%, 7.0%, and 7.4% 
(P < 0.04),  respectively, but had increased plasma TG level of 
9.7% (P < 0.0001).
Liver triglyceride content
Both sex and diet affected the liver TG content of broilers on 
day 42 (P <  0.003),  but sex  ×  diet interaction did not (Table 5). 
Compared with the control, Mn supplementation decreased 
liver TG content by 8.8% (P
 <  0.001),  and no difference was 
observed between the 2 Mn sources. Compared with roosters, 
the hens had increased liver TG content of 6.6% (P
 < 0.003).
Lipid metabolism-related enzyme activities in the 
liver
Diet affected ATGL, FAS, and ME activities in the liver of 
broilers on day 42 ( P <  0.02),  except for liver ACC activity 
(Table 6). Sex and sex  ×  diet interaction did not affect these 
parameters. Compared with the control, Mn supplementa -
tion increased liver ATGL activity by 5.3% (P  < 0.02) but 
decreased liver FAS and ME activities by 14.7% and 22.8% 
(P
 <  0.004),  respectively, but no differences were observed 
between the 2 Mn sources.
mRNA expression levels of lipid metabolism-
related genes in the liver
Diet affected the mRNA expression of FAS, SCD, ME, 
SREBP1, and ATGL in the liver of broilers on day 42 
(P <  0.03),  whereas sex affected liver ACC and CD36 mRNA 
expression (P  < 0.0001) ( Table 7). However, diet did not 
affect the mRNA expression of ACC, APOB, and CD36, 
whereas sex did not affect the mRNA expression of SREBP1, 
FAS, SCD, ME, APOB, and ATGL.  Sex  × diet interaction 
did not affect these parameters. Compared with the control, 
Mn supplementation decreased the mRNA expression of 
SREBP1, SCD, ME, and FAS in the liver by 18.2%, 15.2%,

the ATGL expression by 24.0% ( P < 0.001). No differences 
were observed between the 2 Mn sources. Compared with the 
roosters, the hens exhibited upregulated mRNA expression 
of liver ACC and CD36 of 27.5% and 31.0% ( P

respectively.
Protein expression levels in the liver
Diet affected the protein expression of SREBP1, SCD, and 
ATGL in the liver of broilers on day 42 (P
 < 0.0007), but the 
sex and the sex ×  diet interaction did not affect these parame-
ters (Table 8, Figure 1). Compared with the control, Mn addi-
tion decreased liver SREBP1 and SCD protein expression by 
7.7% and 8.9% (P
 <  0.001),  respectively, but increased liver 
ATGL protein expression by 7.1% ( P < 0.001). No differ -
ences were observed between the 2 Mn sources.
Discussion
This study showed that Mn sulfate or Mn-Prot M added to 
diets effectively increased Mn contents in the plasma and 
liver, ATGL activity and its mRNA and protein expressions in 
the liver, but significantly decreased plasma TG, TC, LDL-C, 
and liver TG content, FAS and ME activities, mRNA expres-
sion of SREBP1, FAS, SCD, and ME, and protein expression 
of SREBP1 and SCD in the liver. These results suggest that 
dietary Mn supplementation decrease hepatic lipid accumu -
lation in broilers by inhibiting SREBP1 and SCD expression, 
as well as FAS and ME activities and enhancing ATGL activ-
ity and expression, which partly supports our hypotheses. 
However, there were no differences between the 2 added Mn 
sources as well as no sex ×  diet interactions in all of the mea-
sured indices, indicating that both Mn sulfate and Mn pro-
teinate were equally effective. The roosters or hens responded 
similarly to the above modulating aspects of dietary Mn addi-
tion, which did not support our hypotheses, possibly because 
the Mn concentrations in the basal diets were not low enough 
and/or the above lipid metabolism-related enzymes are not 
Mn-containing enzymes. Therefore, the assays of the above 
enzymes were not sensitive enough to detect these changes. 
These findings, which have not been reported before, offer a 
new insight into the rational addition of Mn to diets in broiler 
production.
Previous studies have shown that adding Mn to the diet 
of broilers effectively reduced hepatic fat deposition ( Luo et 
al., 1998), which agrees with this study’s results. Hepatic Mn 
content has been identified as an indicator of the Mn nutri -
tional status of organisms. Some studies have demonstrated 
that with increasing dietary Mn levels, plasma and liver Mn 
contents increase significantly ( Mwangi S et al., 2019 ; Groff 
Urayama et al., 2023 ), which also agrees with this study’s 
results. Plasma-free fatty acids and TGs are crucial for fat 
deposition in broilers (Nematbakhsh et al., 2021 ). The liver 
produces key lipoprotein particles, including HDL, LDL, and 
intermediate-density lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are car-
riers for components that are then transported to adipocytes 
(Alvarenga et al., 2011 ; Na et al., 2018 ). Significant reduc -
tions in liver LDL and TC contents due to Mn addition were 
observed in this study, suggesting that Mn would be asso -
ciated with hepatic cholesterol metabolism. LDL  transports

cholesterol synthesized in the liver to the bloodstream ( Qiao 
et al., 2007). Consequently, the significant decreases in plasma 
LDL and cholesterol levels, coupled with the reduction in 
TG contents in the plasma and liver, indicated that Mn was 
actively involved in hepatic lipid metabolism in broilers. 
However, insignificant differences were observed between 
the 2 Mn sources in these indices, indicating that the 2 Mn 
sources were equally effective in this study.
Previous investigations conducted in cattle have substan-
tiated the pivotal role of SREBP1 as a master regulator of 
cholesterogenesis (Matsuhashi et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, 
several downstream genes were affected by fluctuations in the 
expression levels of the SREBP gene, resulting in significant 
changes in adipose tissue composition (Gamarra et al., 2021). 
Our study showed that dietary supplementation with Mn in 
broilers reduced the SREBP1 mRNA and protein expressions 
in the liver. This finding underscores the critical role of down-
regulated SREBP1 expression as a mechanism through which 
Mn exerts its inhibitory effect on hepatic lipid deposition. 
Therefore, SREBP1, acting as a transcriptional factor, might 
play a crucial role in modulating the hepatic lipid metabolism 
of broilers by participating in the synthesis of cholesterol and 
fatty acids.
Both FAS and ME are essential rate-limiting enzymes that 
facilitate the scratch production of long-chain fatty acids 
in animals ( Goodridge et al., 1989 ), and their activities are 
closely related to hepatic fat synthesis. The addition of Mn 
reduces the activities and mRNA expression of FAS and ME 
enzymes (Katsurada et al., 1987). In this study, dietary Mn 
supplementation reduced fatty acid synthesis in the liver by 
decreasing FAS and ME expression, and then reduced liver 
lipid deposition, which is consistent with the results of Lu 
et al. (2017). Lu et al. (2017) reported that Mn chloride and 
Mn-amino acid complexes decreased hepatic lipid synthesis 
by inhibiting FAS activity in broiler hepatocytes. However, 
Mn-Prot M and Mn-sulfate were equally effective in affecting 
these indices in the liver of broilers, which is consistent with 
the other results obtained in this study.
SCD catalyzes the conversion of paleic and stearic acids to 
saturated palmitoleic (C16:1) and oleic (C18:1) acids, respec-
tively (Wang et al., 2006 ). This enzyme plays various roles, 
including participation in lipid synthesis, insulin responsive -
ness, and oxidation of genetically determined fatty acids in 
the liver, muscle, and fat tissues. Moreover, SCD serves as a 
regulatory gene in the metabolic pathways of unsaturated 
fatty acids ( Payne et al., 2009 ; Huang et al., 2015 ). In this 
study, Mn addition decreased both the mRNA and protein 
expressions of liver SCD, possibly reducing the scratch pro-
duction of unsaturated fatty acids and fat deposition, which is 
consistent with the report of Lin et al. (2022) in mice.

Adipose triglyceride lipase is a vital and rate-limiting enzyme 
for triglyceride catabolism in the liver, and it controls most 
intracellular lipid turnover (Ghosh et al., 2016 ). Lipid depo-
sition in primary chicken hepatocytes was correlated neg -
atively with the ATGL gene expression ( Liu et al., 2018 ). In 
this study, dietary Mn supplementation increased liver ATGL 
expression and activity and decreased liver fat deposition in 
broilers. However, Mn-Prot M and Mn-sulfate were equally 
effective in affecting these indices in the liver of broilers, which
